Blue—Ah, blue is but a name\r\ntill you have seen the sea that breaks around the Bahamas and gives\r\nanchorage to the tall ships at Port Royal; that great sheet of blue\r\nwater stretching from Cape Catoche to the Windward Islands, and from\r\nYucatan to beyond the Bahamas, studded with banks and keys and reefs,\r\nthe old sea of the Buccaneers shot over with the doings of Kidd and\r\nSingleton and Horne.\r\n\r\nOn the salt white sand in the blinding dazzle of sunlight the waves\r\nwere falling, clear-green, crystalline, each lovely as a jewel. The\r\ncrying of the gulls, loud all the morning, had died down with high\r\nafternoon and high tide; the wind had faded as though withered by the\r\nsun. Just at the moment of high tide the sea makes a pause in its\r\neternal labour, the great act of systole has been accomplished and,\r\nbreak the waves as they may, the profound languor of the ocean makes\r\nitself heard and felt.\r\n\r\nGaspard Cadillac, ex-stoker of the _Rhone_, sitting with his back\r\nagainst a palm tree cleaning an old tobacco pipe and absorbed in the\r\njob, felt this pause and hold-up in nature just as the gulls felt\r\nit—just as much and just as little as they.\r\n\r\n“I have raised my horizon,” said the sea. “I have lifted fleets towards\r\nheaven, hidden reefs; I have drained the occidental shores and domed\r\nwith water the Indies, I rest from my labours and I dream.”\r\n\r\nOur man beneath the tree was a Moco. The French navy is divided into\r\ntwo great classes, the men from the south and the men from the north,\r\nthe Moco and the Ponantaise.\r\n\r\nGaspard was a man from the south, a Provençal, dark, handsome in a\r\nrough way, wiry and vivid. Yves, his bosom companion, also a stoker of\r\nthe _Rhone_ and the only survivor with Gaspard of the wreck of that\r\nill-fated ship, was a Ponantaise, a big man from Bretagne with a blond\r\nbeard. Yves was over away on the other side of the little island now\r\nhunting for what he might find in the rock pools and creeks. Away out\r\nthere in a right line from where Gaspard was sitting beneath the palm\r\ntrees, under the blinding dazzle of sea, the _Rhone_ was lying with her\r\nbottom ripped out, her boilers burst, her boats hanging smashed at her\r\ndavits; a horrible travesty of a ship, knocked under the sea as if with\r\nthe blow of a giant’s fist, a raffle of ropes, machinery, and corpses.\r\n\r\nThe gods had been very good to Gaspard and Yves, and Gaspard had,\r\nby the direction of the gods, been the salvation of Yves. The whole\r\ncatastrophe had come like a clap of thunder on a moonlit sea. The\r\n“Haa-r _rip_” of the reef that had been waiting a million years for the\r\n_Rhone_, the screaming of scalding steam and scalded men, a wild bellow\r\nfrom the siren, the roar of the boilers opening out, and the shout of\r\nthe lifting decks, all that, so thunderous and apocalyptic, so full of\r\ntragedy, and torment, and woe, filled the night for a moment for miles\r\naround, and then there was nothing but the moonlit sea.\r\n\r\nYves was a good swimmer, but his heart had gone out in him; he had been\r\nheld down under water by the suck of the sinking ship, and he would\r\nhave drowned to a certainty only for Gaspard, who was a bad swimmer but\r\na bad drowner.\r\n\r\nThe wiry Provençal, courageous as a rat, had held Yves’ head above\r\nwater till Yves felt the sea slapping him in the face and saw a great\r\nspar lifting and dripping in the moonlight; saw Gaspard seize the spar,\r\na picture almost instantaneous, a picture that told him at once the\r\ntruth and made him strike out for safety.\r\n\r\nThe set of the current had carried the spar to the islet. One might\r\nhave fancied that the sea, repenting for that sin of hers, had\r\ndetermined to save these two last survivors of the _Rhone_. But the sea\r\ncared for the men as much as she cared for the spar—less, for they\r\nwere lighter.\r\n\r\nBoxes and crates had come drifting ashore, getting caught and tangled\r\nin the reef-mesh to eastward of the islet; a horrible abundance of\r\nprovisions, all sorts of articles from the cargo, corpses, spars,\r\neverything yet nothing, pounding about in the desolate reef-strewn\r\nwater, made the east side of the islet a place to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe two men in the few days since the wreck had salved enough food\r\nto last them for months, there was a spring of water amidst the low\r\nbay-cedar bushes that stretched from shore edge to shore edge, the\r\nislet was in a trade track, and they were certain of near rescue; all\r\nthese circumstances made them easy of mind and made a holiday of the\r\nepisode.\r\n\r\nGaspard having cleaned the pipe to his satisfaction, filled it with\r\ntobacco and lit it. Then he lay on his back with his head in the\r\nscanty shade of the palm fronds, the peak of his cap over his eyes, the\r\nsmoke from his pipe curling upwards in the windless air.\r\n\r\nWindless for a moment only. The tide had turned and with the turn of\r\nthe tide a faint breathing shook the palm tops against the blue. Maybe\r\nit was the breeze carrying the voices nearer, but the crying of the\r\ngulls seemed to louden with the turning tide.\r\n\r\n  Jean François de Nantes,\r\n  Jean François, Jean François,\r\n  Jean François de Nantes,\r\n  Jean François, Jean François.\r\n\r\nThe old interminable song of the French navy immortalized by Loti\r\nsang in the ears of the Moco as he lay, blissful, forgetful, seeing\r\npictures, dreaming dreams.\r\n\r\nNow he was in the stokehold of the _Rhone_ feeding furnace No. 2. He\r\ncould feel the cotton waste protecting his hands from the heat of the\r\nrake; he could hear the clatter of the ash lift and the boom of the sea.\r\n\r\nHi! Hi! Hi! The weary, querulous call of the gulls brought up the\r\n_Tamalpais_, a three-master in which he had served for a voyage.\r\n\r\nHi! Hi! Hi! It was the very voices of the men hauling on the halyards;\r\nhe could see the topsails bellying to the wind, the great sails held\r\nhard against the blue, the yards, the studding sail booms; away from\r\nyears ago and across three thousand miles of sea came the voices of the\r\nmen hauling in chorus, echoes from the past answering the lamentable\r\ncrying of the gulls.\r\n\r\nAnd now the _Tamalpais_ went to pieces, became a curl of smoke,\r\nvanished, and he was on the wharves of Marseilles, in a bar standing\r\nbefore a zinc counter, a chopin of wine, and a girl.\r\n\r\nAh! that was it, the girl; some piece of grit had been irritating\r\nhis mind for the last few minutes, something behind his laziness and\r\nhappiness had been working for his discomfort; we all know that feeling\r\nwhen the subconscious self is grumbling or worrying over something that\r\nthe conscious self has forgotten for a moment.\r\n\r\nAnisette was the name she went by; a pale-faced, undersized girl. You\r\nwould not, possibly, have looked at her twice, but had you done so you\r\nwould, were you a man, certainly have looked at her a third time.\r\n\r\nShe was of the type that appeals to a man’s passions, never to his\r\nheart, and she stood at the bar of the Riga where the Swedes and\r\nNorwegians congregate, and there Yves and Gaspard had fallen in with\r\nher and she had favoured Yves.\r\n\r\nThe big, blond Yves had captured this little pirate who had sailed for\r\nyears unharmed and harmful. She had scorned Gaspard, who would have\r\ngiven his hand for a glance from her, and she had given herself wholly\r\nto Yves.\r\n\r\nHad he loved the woman with a pure and simple love Gaspard might have\r\nforgiven Yves, his bosom companion, for the victory; his affection for\r\nYves was one of those brotherly loves that ennoble a man, and the Moco\r\nwas capable, perhaps, of a splendid abnegation. But Yves had crossed\r\nhim in his passions and the Moco was a man who could never forgive that.\r\n\r\nHi! Hi! Hi!\r\n\r\nGirl and bar and Riga tavern vanished, giving place to Marseilles\r\nharbour, with the _Rhone_ thrashing her way out. A passenger had given\r\nYves a cigar; it was always the way; Yves had all the luck; if there\r\nwas a cigar or a drink going it always fell to Yves—or a girl—yet he,\r\nGaspard, had saved this man’s life.\r\n\r\nNow, on board ship, at work, all these grumblings would have been there\r\nin the heart of Gaspard, but they would have been undeveloped; here,\r\nin idleness, they grew; and to visualize the awful power of woman it\r\nis enough to make your mental standpoint the apex of a vast triangle\r\nthe other two angles of which are Anisette serving drinks in the\r\ntobacco-smelling bar of the Riga and the Moco beneath the palm trees\r\nwarring in thought against his bosom friend Yves.\r\n\r\nA great crab fell with a thud on the sand beside Gaspard, who sprang\r\nhalf erect to find himself face to face with Yves.\r\n\r\nThe Ponantaise was laughing. He had caught the crab amidst the rocks;\r\nhe had two more under his arm, their claws tied together with a string;\r\nhe had found a boat sail from the _Rhone_ and a small spar, out of\r\nwhich he intended to make a tent; he flung the lot on the sand and then\r\nsat down beside his companion, took out his pipe, filled it, lit it,\r\nand began to smoke.\r\n\r\nThe Moco, after his exclamation of surprise, had fallen back in his old\r\nposition, and the two men smoked without interchanging a word.\r\n\r\nThey would go like this for a long time without speaking a word. One\r\nmight have fancied them enemies, or at least put out at one another;\r\nnot at all. They were simply sharing the tremendous taciturnity of\r\ntheir species. All who help in the labor of the sea share in its\r\nweariness, _Vasta Silentio_, the motto, is written on the waves.\r\n\r\nHi! Hi! Hi!\r\n\r\nThe breeze had freshened a bit, giving life and energy to the calling\r\nof the gulls; the Moco, his pipe out, pushed his cap back from his eyes\r\nand sat up.\r\n\r\n“See here,” said Yves, “you know over there where I fetched these\r\nthings from—well—over there I’ve found something.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA SECRET OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\n“Eh bien?”\r\n\r\nThe big Yves laughed in his beard and dug his naked toes into the\r\nhot white sand luxuriously. Gaspard was shod, for he had turned in\r\nall standing just before the disaster to the ship; but Yves, more\r\nparticular or less tired, had kicked his shoes off.\r\n\r\n“_Eh bien?_”\r\n\r\n“Something funny, _mordieu!_ Yes, when you see it you’ll stare.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it? You keep on like an old woman; if you found anything\r\nfunnier than yourself it would be queer.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, come and look and you will see.” Yves rose to his feet,\r\nkicked the crabs into a heap, spread the sail on the sand, and placing\r\nthe crabs in the sail, made a bundle of them; having tied the bundle\r\nwith a rope he placed it in the shadow of the palms.\r\n\r\n“That will keep them safe till we come back,” said Yves, “_allons_.”\r\n\r\nHe led the way right across the islet to the north.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely a quarter of a mile wide, this islet, and covered\r\nfrom shore edge to shore edge with thick bay-cedar bushes rising to\r\nthe knees. The only trees upon it were the palms. Those seven palms\r\ngathered in the clump beneath whose shade the Moco had been lying.\r\n\r\nThe breeze, which had freshened momentarily, had now died again, and\r\nas they tramped through the dense growth the sun, now passing into the\r\nwestern sky, struck them on their left sides so that they could have\r\nsworn they were walking side turned to an open furnace door. But they\r\nwere used to heat and neither of them grumbled, or only occasionally\r\nthe Moco.\r\n\r\n“Well, this is a nice tramp to see something funny; it seems to me the\r\nfunny thing is that we should be sweating ourselves like this; if you\r\ncould shew me a decent bar at the end of our journey—”\r\n\r\n“Come on,” replied Yves; “you will not be sorry when you see it.”\r\n\r\nThe sea to the eastward of the island was heavily sown with reefs; the\r\ngreat reef that had destroyed the _Rhone_ lay due south; northward\r\nthere were also reefs; only to the west was the approach to the island\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\n“Here we are,” said Yves, as he tramped his way out of the bushes and\r\non to the northern beach, the Moco following.\r\n\r\nYes, there were reefs here, indeed, just a dark bloom under the blue\r\nwater, just a trace of snow; a pencilling of foam shewed where the\r\nmurderers of the sea lay hidden, and the sea was beautiful here,\r\nmore beautiful than to the south of the island, for the reefs and\r\nthe shallows were continually changing in the wonderful light of the\r\ntropics to suit the hour of the day; colours chasing colours, sky blue\r\nparallels of sea and heather purple lines of reef greeting the dawn,\r\ncornflower-coloured spaces of water flashing the sky back like mirrors\r\nat noon, whilst at sunset, in those wonderful sunsets that reach to the\r\nzenith, all this stretch of sea and reef would be a field of beaten\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nJust as the ever-changing light of day made ever-changing beauties,\r\nso did the ever-changing air, and ever-changing tide; at low tide with\r\na strong breeze every reef would speak and you would hear a sound that\r\nonce heard you would never forget, the song of a hundred tiny shores,\r\nthe tune of the reefs. Sometimes in those great low tides in which we\r\nfancy the moon and the sun hauling together at the heavy blue robe of\r\nthe sea, as if to make her shew her hidden armour and her scars, the\r\nreefs would be fully exposed, razor-edged, hungry, and lean. In these\r\nlow tides you would see great fish betrayed by the sea and trapped in\r\nthe pools, flinging themselves in the air like curved silver swords.\r\nConversely, in the great high tides you might have sailed a battleship\r\nin fancy over the unclouded water.\r\n\r\nYves, leaving the beach, began to clamber along a ledge of rock that\r\nwent straight out from the shore like a natural pier; Gaspard followed\r\nhim, treading the seaweed under foot. There were no gulls here; the\r\nfishing ground of the gulls lay to the southeast, but so small was the\r\nisland that you could still hear their voices on the air that had now\r\nbecome absolutely windless.\r\n\r\nThe water lay deep and clear on the left of the ledge of the rocks, but\r\nGaspard had eyes for nothing but the slippery seaweed under foot.\r\n\r\nThese reefs are as a rule so rough, so serrated with keen-edged spines\r\nof coral, that bare-footed, as Yves was, to walk on them would be\r\nimpossible; but this great ledge was comparatively smooth; it lay\r\nabove high tide for the first hundred yards or so, and then, shelving\r\nslightly, lost itself at high tide beneath the water.\r\n\r\nThe tide since its turn had already fallen two feet and the hidden\r\npart of the reef was beginning to shew. It was plain to the eye that\r\nthe whole reef formed the edge of an immense bath-like basin, an\r\nelliptiform lagoon, the longest diameter of which lay from north to\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nYves led the way till they were fifty yards from the shore; then he\r\nstopped, turned, and pointed into the green clear water to the left.\r\n\r\nThe lagoon, unruffled by a breath of wind, lay lit to its heart and\r\nburning like a vast and flawless emerald, its floor of salt white sand,\r\nthough invisible to the eye, was still reached by the sun rays and\r\nflung them back in a million sparkles that combined to form the water’s\r\ndazzling soul.\r\n\r\nTwenty feet out from the reef lay what seemed at first a flat-topped,\r\nreed-grown rock; the tide was slowly uncovering it and the ribbons\r\nof seaweed growing from it waved in the aquamarine of the water as\r\ngrass or land foliage waves in a gentle wind. The rock, weed-grown and\r\nemerging from the water, had for a base a column thicker than a man’s\r\nbody, a column here dazzling bright and flower coloured, here dim and\r\ndarkened with growing fucus; a column whose lowermost part was lost in\r\nthe vagueness of the lagoon. The Moco, who had flung himself down and\r\nwas leaning over the reef ledge so as to see better, gave a start. His\r\nsailor’s eye, after the first surprise, saw through the mystery of the\r\nrock growing like a hideous flower on a coloured stalk. The rock was\r\nthe foretop of a ship, the column was the coral-crusted mast.\r\n\r\nBut the mystery dispelled was as nothing to the mystery half-unveiled.\r\nTo the Moco, who combined in himself the imagination of the southern\r\nman and the imagination of the sailor, this hint of a ship in the still\r\nand silent water appealed more forcibly than the full sight of a wreck\r\non a thunderous beach.\r\n\r\nThe coral-crusted mast led the eye down till the sight found the pale,\r\nfish-like form of the ship itself.\r\n\r\n“_Boufre_,” cried the Moco; “’tis as thick as a funnel.” Then he was\r\nsilent as was Yves, and lying side by side on the grey dead coral of\r\nthe reef, they contemplated the column of living coral that once had\r\nformed the mast of a ship.\r\n\r\nThe ship lay below unharmed as to her fore part, else the mast would\r\nnot have been left standing; driven years ago by some great wave, she\r\nmust have passed at one stride of the sea over the circling reef of the\r\nlagoon, to sink, the water pouring through her shattered timbers, and\r\nlie lost here forever.\r\n\r\nOr, in those past days there may have been a break in the reef built\r\nup long ago by the restless coral. How she had found her last resting\r\nplace who could say; what had been her business who could tell, but\r\ntrumpets could not have proclaimed doom and death more poignantly than\r\ndid the awful silence, the vagueness into which the mast sank and\r\nwavered, towards the ghostly ship.\r\n\r\nFor eight feet or so below the foretop the mast was dressed with\r\nseaweed, shewing only here and there the white of the coral crust;\r\nbelow that the seaweed did not grow. The eight feet indicated the rise\r\nand fall of the tide, for the lagoon, though shewing no break in its\r\nencircling reef, communicated through twenty unseen openings with the\r\nouter sea and filled and emptied to high and low water like a great\r\ncullender.\r\n\r\nFlights of painted fishes flashed now and then through the water and\r\nvanished, the seaweeds growing from the mast shewed waving as if to\r\na submarine wind, now like dark brown ribbons of shadow, now like a\r\ndrowned woman’s hair powdered with sparkling blossoms; now a tress of\r\nvivid green would be loosened by the fingers of the outgoing tide,\r\ncatch a sunbeam and shew its beauty, or a tress of amber.\r\n\r\nAs they watched and as the tide sank lower, inch by inch and foot\r\nby foot, the hidden portion of the mast jewelled with coral and sea\r\ngrowths stole more clearly into view, and foot by foot the seaweed\r\nportion beneath the foretop stole from the water and stood dripping,\r\ndank, and dismal in the sun, clearer and clearer like a grey cloud,\r\nfish-shaped and enormous in the green below the lost ship began to\r\nunveil herself to the sight. It was like the coming of a ghost, a thing\r\nmost dim yet wonderful to be seen.\r\n\r\nOne could trace the mast, now, right down to the deck. It sprang from\r\na coloured column from which here and there grew great sea fans that\r\nseemed made from dark lace and strewn here and there with all colours\r\nfrom the brilliant red of tiny starfish to the delicate peach-bloom of\r\nthe flat lichen coral. So rich, so delicate, so opulent in colour, it\r\nmight have been the column of some fairy palace, this old foremast of a\r\nforgotten ship.\r\n\r\nThe two men, taking comfortable positions on the reef, had lit their\r\npipes. Hour after hour they sat smoking, interchanging a few words,\r\nbut always with their eyes alive for changes in the water below. Now\r\nforgetting to smoke, they lay on their elbows looking down into the\r\ngreen depth where, stronger through the shallowing water, sharper,\r\nclearer, the ship began to shew her form hideous to the sight as the\r\nform of a man bloated by disease; grey, enormous, muffled with coral,\r\ntufted with what seemed fungous growths.\r\n\r\n“Look,” said Yves, pointing down to where the fantastically high poop\r\nwas humping itself into view, “saw you ever a ship built in that\r\nfashion floating on the sea? Why she is from the time of Noah—In the\r\nchurch at Paimpol they have a model ship like that; she was dedicated\r\nto the Virgin in the old days—”\r\n\r\n“Let us look,” growled the Moco, speaking as if irritated by the voice\r\nof his companion; then he hung silent, his eyes fixed on the vision\r\ndeveloping below. The tide had sunk now to within a foot of low water\r\nmark, and as the veil of water lessened so did the vision strengthen;\r\none could make out the decks clearly, all rough with coral, and the\r\ncoral banks that were once the bulwarks, a stump of mainmast was left\r\nand had become converted into a cone of coral the height of a man;\r\ntrace of mizzen mast there was none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEVENING\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this time, steadily as the tide, the sun had been sinking; he had\r\ndropped through a dazzling azure sky and he was now hanging almost in\r\ntouch with the western horizon, a ball of fire in a sky of dazzling\r\ngold; momently the gold of the sunset took possession of the sky,\r\nspreading up, up, till the very zenith was reached, and down, down,\r\ntill the gilding reached the eastern sky line. The world now seemed\r\nclipped in the cup of a great golden flower, and the little ripples\r\nthat came sighing in round the low tide reefs showed their foam like\r\nfleeces of gold. Not a trace of cloud shewed in the golden sky, not a\r\nwave on the golden sea; in that wonderful sunset the palm tops burned\r\nlike fingers of flame, and as music lights the soul of man, so did the\r\ngolden and glowing atmosphere the heart of the lagoon.\r\n\r\nThe ship in the water below answered to the magic of the light;\r\nthe thing that had been grey and dismal as death was in a moment\r\ntransformed to a dream of colour, the brains of frost-white coral\r\nbecame golden lamps; starfish, sea-flowers, coraline growths, pink,\r\ncrimson, indigo, pale yellow, colour and form, all lent their adornment.\r\n\r\nShadowless on her bed of dazzling sand she hung for a moment, burning\r\nin full sight, clear to the eye as though she were floating in air and\r\nexquisite as a jewel, then just as she had bloomed she faded out, her\r\ncolour and beauty passing with the fading light, and as night swept\r\nover the sea like the shadow of a violet-wing, she vanished utterly,\r\nwhilst the lagoon filled with darkness and the first stars cast their\r\nshimmer on its surface.\r\n\r\n“_Eh bien?_” said Yves, as he rose to his feet and stretched himself.\r\nThe Moco, who had also risen to his feet, looked around him at the\r\nworld of darkness that had displaced the world of gold; he had seen\r\nmany things, but nothing that had ever struck his imagination so\r\nvividly as the sight now veiled by darkness. His mind could not reason\r\non the question or refute by logic the feeling in his heart that what\r\nhe had seen was evil.\r\n\r\nAll that gaiety and colour decking the ruin of man’s work was like\r\nlaughter coming from under the seas.\r\n\r\nYves felt nothing of this.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said the Moco, turning towards the shore, “let’s go back.”\r\n\r\nAs they tramped their way through the brushwood they talked of the\r\nthing they had seen. Yves thought that from the height of her poop she\r\nmust be very old, or it might be that it was only a very big deck-house\r\nsnowed over with coral; he slapped his thigh as he walked, pleased with\r\nthe idea of the snow; when a boy in Brittany he had seen things heaped\r\nwith snow and bulked out in size, carts, barrels, and so forth, just as\r\nthe old ship was heaped and bulked out with coral; but the simile was\r\nlost on Gaspard; you do not get snow at Montpellier to any extent; also\r\nhis mind more trained by early education, and more supple by heredity,\r\nrefused to draw images from gross bulk; the colours appealed to him;\r\n“_mordieu_,” said he, “she reminds me most of a ship of flowers I once\r\nsaw drawn along in the carnival procession at Montpellier.”\r\n\r\n“Flowers,” laughed Yves, “where would you get flowers under the sea?”\r\nThe stupidity of Yves roused Gaspard’s ever-ready anger.\r\n\r\n“From the devil, maybe—I was not talking of flowers under the sea; I\r\nwas talking of what I had seen in Montpellier.”\r\n\r\nThey had reached the southern beach, where the palm trees grew, and\r\nYves set about lighting a fire of dry brushwood; when it was burning he\r\nheaped on some wreck-wood; the ship of coral, the wreck of the _Rhone_,\r\ntheir position, all were banished from his mind by the business in hand.\r\n\r\nWhen supper was finished they sat each with his back against a palm\r\ntree. The work of the day was over. They had rigged up a rough sort of\r\ntent with the boat sail and some broken spars, but the warm night held\r\nthem in the open.\r\n\r\nThe red light of the fire lit the white sand to within a few yards\r\nof the sea edge, where the waves were falling gently, rhythmically,\r\ndrowsily, Haassh—Haassh—Haassh—a chill and dreamy sound. Above, the\r\nsky solid with stars, voiceless, windless, seemed a thing more alive\r\nand active than the sea. From the slight elevation where they sat a\r\nghostly white streak on the starlit sea to the southward indicated the\r\nreef that had slain the _Rhone_; only at low tide and half way between\r\nflood and ebb tide did the snow of the surf indicate the position of\r\nthe murderer.\r\n\r\n“She had a lot of gold in her for Havana,” said Yves, breaking silence\r\nand nodding in the direction of the reef; “seems a pity that it should\r\nbe lying there under the sea and no one to spend it.”\r\n\r\n“See here,” said Gaspard, “it’s strange I was thinking of that hooker\r\nlying in the lagoon over there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking, maybe, there is stuff worth looking for a’board her if\r\none could get at it.”\r\n\r\nYves laughed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you could get at it—if you could get at it—and she built\r\nover with coral a foot thick; and if you could break through it what\r\nwould you find? dead men’s bones. It’s like your flowers under the\r\nsea.” He tapped the dottle out of his pipe, rose, stretched, and\r\nturned toward the little tent, whilst Gaspard without a word continued\r\nsmoking; he could have struck Yves.\r\n\r\nThe son of a tradesman in Montpellier, he possessed still some\r\nrudiments of the education he had received before that fatal day when,\r\ndriven by the instinct of wandering and the hatred of restraint, he had\r\nrun away to sea. Yves, the son of long generations of sailors, had gone\r\nto sea as a duckling goes to the pond. Gaspard had been taken there by\r\nhis imagination. He knew himself superior to the lumbering Yves whose\r\nfingers were like fish-hooks, who had the manners of a bear and the\r\nwalk of a walrus, yet Yves was always proving himself (by chance, no\r\ndoubt) the better and the luckier man.\r\n\r\nHe turned in under the shelter of the tent where Yves was already\r\nsnoring, and he slept and dreamt of the docks of Marseilles, of\r\nAnisette, and of Yves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSPANISH GOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the salt-white sand of the beach to eastward, and some two hundred\r\nyards from the palm-clump a ridge of coral rocks ran out into the sea\r\nlike a natural pier. The water lay deep off these rocks and the fishing\r\nwould have been good had the ship-wrecked ones possessed lines and\r\nhooks.\r\n\r\nGaspard, next day, late in the afternoon was standing at the end of\r\nthis coral pier, the sea of an incredible blue, sailless, forlorn,\r\ncame glassing shoreward in long gentle lines of swell, slobbering and\r\nsighing by the rocks and breaking sadly on the sands.\r\n\r\nWhen the sea comes in like this in long spaced undulations a voice\r\nsteals through her voice, the something tragic, the _quid obscurum_\r\nthat hides in nature and speaks through the elements and the passions\r\nis heard. The sea has a hundred voices, Gaiety, Triumph, Strength,\r\nSadness, Regret, the wave speaks them all. But stand on a day like this\r\non a desolate island in the tropics and listen to the voice that steals\r\nfrom all that splendour of light and gaiety of colour, the violent\r\nheaving wastes of water, the triumphant sun, the sky of living blue,\r\nthrough all these, from all these you will hear a voice, it is borne by\r\nthe languid voice of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is the voice of Loneliness.\r\n\r\nLoneliness—Fate, Death, Tragedy—all these are dwarfed before her,\r\nto escape from whom the very atoms of matter cling together, animals\r\njoin in herds, men in communities. She who says to man “I walk by\r\nyou from the cradle to the grave, with me you go forth from the world\r\nalone, because of me you work out your fate alone, by the shores and\r\ndesolate plains of the north I shew my face, by the tropic sea men hear\r\nmy voice. I am she who makes Death terrible. I am she who makes Love\r\nbeautiful. Love my only enemy.”\r\n\r\nGaspard, standing on the reef, heard the voice, his eyes were fixed on\r\nthe green water in the shadow of the rocks, an albicore like a flashing\r\nsword had passed a moment ago, now there was nothing to be seen but\r\nthe crystalline vagueness through which here and there floated a scrap\r\nof fucus. Just in that second, held between the sound of the sea and\r\nthe mesmeric crystal of the water his mind heard Loneliness speak.\r\nJust in that moment was borne in on him dimly, and without awakening\r\ntrue comprehension, the tragic fact of human isolation, the fact that\r\neach man is on a desert island set round by the sea of life, and that\r\nthere alone he must work out his fate, unless from some island in the\r\ndistance Love should bring him help.\r\n\r\nThe fact came to him as a sensation rather than a thought, the grave\r\nharmonics of the sea had whispered to him this eternal truth, the fact\r\nwhich is the master fact of life.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, from behind, as he stood there gazing into the depths came\r\na voice that made him turn. Yves far away amidst the low bushes was\r\nbeckoning and calling to him, capering, gesticulating, flinging his\r\narms about. Yves seemed to have gone mad, and Gaspard, making along the\r\nrocks, ran across the sand, and through the bushes towards him.\r\n\r\nOver the bushes the air was shaking with the heat, Yves was much\r\nfarther off than he had seemed from the rocks; he was almost at the\r\ncentre of the islet, and now as Gaspard made his way through the bushes\r\nhe saw that his companion held something in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Hurry up, lazy bones,” cried Yves, “and see what I have found.” He\r\nwaved the thing in the air, it was a belt with a brass buckle and a\r\npouch attached to it. He was laughing, one might have fancied that he\r\nhad fallen on some great, good fortune.\r\n\r\nHe had.\r\n\r\n“Look,” cried Yves. He opened the pouch, it was filled with big pieces\r\nof gold; they had been wrapped in oilskin, he had flung the oilskin\r\naway and he stood with his two great hands outspread clasping the pouch\r\nand the treasure bursting from it.\r\n\r\nGaspard at the sight gave a cry that rang across the islet and was\r\nanswered by the ever-wheeling gulls.\r\n\r\n“Gold!” cried Gaspard, seizing a piece from the hand of Yves. He\r\nexamined it, bit it, glanced at it again. He seemed dazed and had the\r\nlook of a man who, long a prisoner in darkness, had been suddenly\r\nbrought face to face with a powerful light. The piece of gold was\r\nSpanish, a piece of eight, heavy, and stamped with the stately effigies\r\nof a vanished king.\r\n\r\n“Look!” cried Yves, taking the coin back from the hand of Gaspard and\r\nreplacing it in the pouch with the others. “Look!” As he buckled the\r\npouch he pointed with his foot at something amidst the bushes. Just\r\nhere the bushes were thinner than elsewhere and here the ground was\r\nraised in a little mound. Amidst the bushes, white and desolate, lay\r\nsome bones. They were strewn hither and thither. One might have fancied\r\nthat here once lay a skeleton, the embers of a man that some wind had\r\nblown upon and scattered. A skeleton, in fact, had once lain here,\r\non or amongst the bushes, but so long ago that the bushes dying and\r\ngrowing again had cast the fragments apart. The skeleton of a man; the\r\nskull which Gaspard had picked up and was now holding in his hand told\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange skull, small and deformed, hideously broad across the\r\ncheek-bones; the bones of the thigh easily distinguished by even the\r\nuntrained eyes of the sailors were unequal in length, the shorter of\r\nthem had been injured or broken, for it shewed the thickening where\r\ncallus had formed.\r\n\r\n“Pah!” cried Gaspard, flinging the skull down. “He must have been a\r\nbeauty whoever he was—and look.” He picked up an old pistol-barrel,\r\neaten away by rust, the trigger plate thin as a leaf and crumbling like\r\na withered leaf to the touch lay near. Many, many years of exposure it\r\nmust have taken to eat the metal away like that. Yves glanced at the\r\nthing without interest. “Come,” said he, and turning, he led the way to\r\nthe southern beach. Here under the palm trees he sat down, opened the\r\npouch, and rattled the gold pieces on the sand between his outspread\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nGaspard, who had followed him without a word, stood, without a word,\r\nlooking on.\r\n\r\nYves counted the pieces; there were twenty-one of them and he was\r\ndisappointed; there had seemed more. He began to recount them. He had\r\nscarcely done so when Gaspard broke silence.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said Gaspard, “half of that falls to my share; half of\r\nthat belongs to me by all rights.”\r\n\r\nYves stopped his counting and looked up. It was the tone of Gaspard’s\r\nvoice rather than his words, perhaps, that caused the expression upon\r\nhis broad, sun-burnt face. A heavy, unfriendly expression, such as the\r\nface of a croupier might wear when some punter disputes the game.\r\n\r\n“Yours?” said Yves, “and who found them?”\r\n\r\n“That’s neither here nor there,” said the Moco, “you found them, it is\r\ntrue, but it was only a question of luck. I might have found them just\r\nas easily, and if I had I would have gone shares.”\r\n\r\nYves knew this to be a fact. Gaspard was the soul of generosity.\r\nGenerosity was not predominant in the soul of Yves. He was a\r\ngood-hearted man, but the Breton peasant was uppermost in his nature;\r\nhe had made this great haul of golden fish entirely with his own hand,\r\nand now he was called upon by a man more generous than himself to share\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing for a moment, but went on counting the pieces; then,\r\nas if addressing them, “Yes, it’s easy to talk of luck—but would I\r\nhave found them if I had been lying lazy on the beach, or staring into\r\nthe sea like some people? No, I was hunting for dead brushwood, doing\r\nsomething for my living, and I found them.”\r\n\r\n“Then keep them,” cried Gaspard, and turning on his heel he walked down\r\nto the sea edge. He walked for a bit along the sand, then, with his\r\narms folded, he stood looking at the sea.\r\n\r\nHis mind had left the subject of the money and was clinging to the true\r\ngrievance he had against Yves. The poisonous source of hatred. Anisette.\r\n\r\nBut the grievance of the money was there as well, and all at once by\r\nsome alchemy of Satan the hundred grudges petty and large that he\r\nhad against his companion joined together and formed the figure of a\r\nmonstrous Yves, a creature he hated, and who, so the devil whispered,\r\nhated him.\r\n\r\nThe sun was now near its setting, and as Gaspard stood there with arms\r\nfolded looking at the sea, the eternal crying of the gulls took on a\r\nnew meaning; they were saying a new word:\r\n\r\n“Yves,—Yves,—Yves.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though the very gulls were mocking him.\r\n\r\n“Yves,—Yves,—Yves.”\r\n\r\nHe turned and strode up the sand to where Yves was sitting beneath the\r\npalm trees.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sinking now over Tampico way in a sky of living gold, the\r\nwestern sea, leaping to meet him, flashed his splendour to the very\r\nshores of the islet; each flake of foam seemed a flake of primrose\r\nlight and the sands stretched like sands of gold by the shores of the\r\ngolden sea.\r\n\r\nGaspard came right up to Yves, the splendour of the sunset on his face,\r\nhis hands clenched in his pockets, his lips dry.\r\n\r\n“All the same,” said Gaspard, as though he were continuing a\r\nconversation, “you are a thief, and a son of a thief—more fool I to\r\nchum with a dog of a Ponantaise.”\r\n\r\nYves rose up; he was a slow man to wrath, but terrible when roused.\r\nThe belt and the pouch containing the money were lying at his feet; he\r\nkicked them aside as he faced the Moco.\r\n\r\n“You say—”\r\n\r\n“I say what I have said.”\r\n\r\n“After the fashion of the monkeys,” replied Yves, “that say what they\r\nhave said all day long—_drop that!_”\r\n\r\nThe Moco had whipped the knife from the sheath in his belt. Both men\r\nwore knives, but the Ponantaise had not drawn his. He stood with his\r\narms folded across his immense chest, literally as though he were\r\nnursing his wrath.\r\n\r\n“It is well known,” said Yves, his eye on the knife, “that a Moco and a\r\nwoman can only fight with their claws and tongue.”\r\n\r\nGaspard dropped the knife; then he stooped and picked it up as if to\r\nreplace it in his belt; he seemed half mad with rage and not to know\r\nwhat he was doing.\r\n\r\nThat was the moment of his life; the next he might have replaced the\r\nknife in its sheath and all would have been well, had not Yves, whose\r\nanger had suddenly passed from his control, spat at the Moco a word.\r\n\r\nA word of one syllable, one of those dead rats of language that these\r\nmen fling at one another in jest, but when spoken in anger are worse\r\nthan a blow.\r\n\r\nThe Moco flung himself back as though a snake had struck at him, then\r\nthe knife in his hand flashed through the air and Yves was on his back\r\non the sand kicking and coughing and whistling at the sky.\r\n\r\nThe knife had just touched the jugular vein in his neck; the air\r\nrushing into the vein made the whistling noise, but Gaspard knew\r\nnothing of this. He strode up to the body of his companion with fists\r\nclenched, prepared for battle, and certain that his antagonist would\r\nspring to his feet and face him.\r\n\r\nThen he saw that Yves was dying. Dying of nothing, apparently, for the\r\nknife was on the sand almost unstained and the stricken man shewed no\r\nwound to speak of, just a scratch on the neck from which the black\r\nblood oozed in froth.\r\n\r\nHad Gaspard raised his eyes to the west he would have seen that the\r\ngreat sun was now cut in half by the sea, dying in a scene of splendour\r\nindescribable, but he saw nothing, nothing, but the face of Yves.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he stood, the last fiery rays of the sun casting his\r\nshadow far away along the sand. Then he was kneeling by the body,\r\nshaking it by the arm, calling upon it to wake up—to come to life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAMIDST THE BUSHES\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the first outburst of raving, impetuous grief, the grief of a\r\nchild rather than the grief of a man, Gaspard rose up from where he had\r\ncast himself down by Yves. The sun had long passed from the sky and the\r\nstar-smitten sea came in smoothly, rhythmically, breaking in foam on\r\nthe starlit sands, and there on the sand lay Yves, listening to what\r\nthe sea was saying.\r\n\r\nHis great right fist, clenched, was lying on his breast; one might\r\nhave fancied that the meaning of it all and the mystery of that sky\r\nso filled with fire and passionate life, and those wastes of the\r\never-fretting sea, had been revealed to him in one stupendous moment,\r\nthat he had struck himself on the breast in the stupefaction of wonder\r\nthat he was gazing and listening, motionless before the revelation\r\nforevermore.\r\n\r\nYves from a common man had become at once and at a stroke a part of\r\nthe immensity and the wonder of the night, the reachless stars and the\r\nfathomless sea; and, for a moment, Gaspard, standing before the body of\r\nthe man he had slain, saw death as the prehistoric man saw it before\r\nlanguage had robbed thought of its freshness and power. For a moment\r\nonly, and then the stars became the stars again, and the sea the sea,\r\nand the dead body of Yves the body of a man he had slain in anger.\r\n\r\nAnd now that his southern nature had spent itself in a wild outburst\r\nof grief just as a child spends itself in an outburst of weeping,\r\nthought came back.\r\n\r\nWell, then?—whose fault was it?\r\n\r\nThe knife was flung with no intent to kill,—what right had he to die\r\nof a scratch like that?—and then the vile word—that was the last of a\r\nlong series of injuries. And bit by bit his mind went back counting up\r\nthe score of these “injuries,” right back to the tobacco-smelling bar\r\nof the Riga and to Anisette as he had last seen her, with her little\r\ngrimy hand resting on the great hairy paw of Yves. That remembrance\r\nlike a hideous lamp lit up all his grievances, enlarging them two-fold.\r\nNo, he was not to blame; he had not meant to kill, and if he had, _Dieu\r\nde Dieu_, look at the provocation!\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment, his chin resting in his hand, his eyes on the\r\nbody before him; then he turned and, walking down to the sea-edge,\r\ndipped his hands and washed his face in the foam. As he turned up the\r\nbeach again towards the trees, wiping his streaming face with the\r\nsleeve of his coat, he felt as though all the occurrences of the last\r\nfew hours had happened years ago, so remote did they seem for the\r\nmoment. The sight of the body lying there so still in the starlight\r\nbrought him to a pause. Grief rushed back on him, driving all little\r\nand evil things from his mind. He stood looking at his handiwork.\r\nIt had been an accident; he had not meant to kill; he did not even\r\nremember flinging the knife. The act had been automatic and committed\r\nin blind rage—all the same, he had killed Yves.\r\n\r\nThen, loathing the business which had to be done, he seized the body of\r\nhis dead companion by the shoulders and began to drag it towards the\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he stepped from the bushes, his task accomplished, he cast his eyes\r\nover the beach. It lay white in the starlight, and there was nothing\r\nnow to tell of tragedy but the knife lying there just as it had fallen\r\nafter its murderous work. He picked it up, dug it in the sand, and\r\nreplaced it in its sheath. The belt with the pouch of money lay under\r\nthe trees; he picked it up automatically and, carrying it in his hand,\r\nturned to the little tent.\r\n\r\nAs he walked towards the tent two heavy hands seemed pressing down on\r\nhis shoulders; unutterable weariness had suddenly fallen upon him,\r\nrobbing him of mind and almost of movement, so that when he reached the\r\ntent he was staggering like a drunken man.\r\n\r\nHe crept under the shelter of the tent, and with the belt and the money\r\nbeside him fell into a profound and dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nALONE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke it was full day and the sands beyond the tent opening lay\r\nwhite and blazing in the sunlight down to the blue, lazy sea.\r\n\r\nHe remembered everything at once. It would almost have seemed that his\r\nmind behind the veil of sleep had been reasoning the matter out, for he\r\nhad awakened saying to himself out loud, and as if he were continuing\r\na conversation, “Yes—and what is more, I saved his life.” He crawled\r\nfrom the tent and stood erect beneath the palms. The morning, warm,\r\nsweet, and sunlit, lay around him; the sapphire sky and flashing sea;\r\nsnow-white gulls and snow-white sands. A hot, gentle wind was stirring\r\nthe palm fronds. He collected some dry brushwood for the fire, lit it,\r\nand piled on some wood from the wreck. When it was alight, flickering\r\na hundred red tongues at the sun and staining the blue air with smoke,\r\nGaspard was brought to his first pause. Of what use was the fire? He\r\nwas no good as a cook. Yves had been the cook; he had cooked crabs,\r\ntinned meat, and what-not, using an old tin for a billy; he was born\r\nfor that sort of work and could do anything practical he turned his\r\nhand to.\r\n\r\nYves had always done the cooking whilst Gaspard had looked on. This\r\nfact struck Gaspard for the first time now. It was as though the dead\r\nYves was still proclaiming his superiority. Yves had salved most of\r\nthe stores, Yves had hunted for dead brushwood, Yves had found crabs,\r\nYves had found the spring of water, Yves had found the boat sail, Yves\r\nhad built the tent, Yves had found the ship of coral in the lagoon,\r\nYves had found the gold. Yves had done everything since their landing,\r\nand he, Gaspard, had done nothing but smoke and dream.\r\n\r\nFar from being a waster, he had, still, left everything to the big\r\nblond man so full of energy and resource and the joy of life; the\r\nsouthern laziness had held possession of him. All the same, Yves had\r\nproved himself the better man and was proving the fact now, voiceless\r\nand dead amidst the bushes as he was.\r\n\r\nGaspard kicked the fire to pieces and flung sand on the embers; then he\r\nbreakfasted on some ship’s biscuit and some tinned meat, lit his pipe\r\nand strolled down to the sea-edge.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o’clock and the gasping warm wind came in over the morning\r\nsea, the lazy, deep blue sea, so infinite, so beautiful, so desolate.\r\n\r\nHe stood, and, shading his eyes, he swept the horizon—not a trace of\r\nsail or smoke could he see. The sky, of a burning emerald just above\r\nthe sea-line, swept up into the burning blue, and from sea and sky,\r\nlike the breath from a great blue mouth, came the warm wind. It felt\r\nlike a woman’s hot fingers playing with his hair, like a woman’s warm\r\narm cast round his neck.\r\n\r\nFrom the southeast with the wind, now loud, now low, came the crying of\r\nthe gulls. Though he had heard them since awakening, he had not noticed\r\nthem till now; he turned his eyes to where they were wheeling and\r\nflying spirit-white in the blue.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Loneliness seized his heart. The fact of his\r\nutter isolation had not stood before him full square till just now.\r\nThe gulls were explaining it to him.\r\n\r\n“You are alone!—alone!—alone! Hi!—Hi!—Hi!—you there on the sands\r\nalone!—alone!—alone!—we have nothing to do with you—we are nothing\r\nto you—alone there on the sands—all day long and night and day, and\r\nnight and day, who will you speak to—what will you do? You there on\r\nthe sands alone!—alone!—alone!”\r\n\r\nHe drew his sleeve across his brow to wipe away the sweat that had\r\nsuddenly started tingling through his skin; then he cast his eyes again\r\nover the sailless blue of the sea and, turning, came back to the tent.\r\nWhen he reached it the terror left him, fell from him suddenly like a\r\ndropped cloak. He cursed himself for his stupidity and, though his pipe\r\nwas not half exhausted, he tapped the tobacco out, re-filled and lit\r\nit. It was something to do. Then, to drive the thought of Yves away, he\r\nfell to imagining what sort of a ship would take him off the island,\r\nand then he stretched his hand into the tent and pulled out the belt\r\nand pouch of money. On the brass buckle of the belt, all green with\r\nverdigris, there was something scratched. He cleaned the brass with\r\nsand—it was something to do—and made out what seemed the initials\r\n“S. S.” He pondered on these for a while and then, opening the pouch,\r\nhe turned the contents on to the sand.\r\n\r\nThough he knew the number of coins, he counted them again and again—it\r\nwas something to do. Then he began to spend them in fancy, the\r\nremembrance of the tragedy of yesterday always standing like a ghost\r\nbehind his thoughts and trying to obtrude itself.\r\n\r\nThis occupation lasted him an hour, and he was brought back from it\r\nsuddenly by a tug at his heart. It was still morning; the awful day\r\nhad scarcely progressed; the mantle of Loneliness had fallen on him\r\nagain; the gulls were still crying, calling, wheeling, rising, falling,\r\nfishing mechanically and seeming part of a tireless mechanism fretting\r\nthe speechless blue of the sky.\r\n\r\nHe put the coins back in the pouch and flung belt and pouch into the\r\ntent; then he rose to his feet and made towards the bushes.\r\n\r\nOn the sand still lay a mark as though a heavy sack had been dragged\r\nalong it towards the bushes.\r\n\r\nHe avoided the pointing of the sinister path and struck across the\r\nislet, crushing the brushwood under foot. He had no object other than\r\nto get away from the place where he was, to keep in motion—to be doing\r\nsomething. The heat lay heavy over the bay cedars, the air was shaking\r\nblanket-fashion under the fiery rays of the sun, the bushes were dense,\r\nyet in a trice it seemed to him he had reached the northern beach. The\r\nislet seemed to have led him across it to explain its smallness, and\r\nas he stepped on to the beach a new sensation caught him in its grip.\r\nThe sensation of being ringed in, enclosed in a small circle from which\r\nthere is no escape.\r\n\r\nYet there were no bars, and around him on every hand stretched infinity.\r\n\r\nHe came along the reef forming the edge of the lagoon; the tide was\r\nbeginning to flood and the foretop of the ship was standing stark and\r\ndry from the water; the ship herself was clearly to be seen, in this\r\nlight even more clearly than in the sunset glow. But the picture was\r\nfar less beautiful.\r\n\r\nGrey and dead she seemed, lying there in the diamond-clear emerald of\r\nthe water, but the lagoon this morning was gay with fish, parrot-fish,\r\ngropers, flights of coloured arrows, sapphire, ruby and emerald-tinted\r\nghosts.\r\n\r\nThe swell of the incoming tide came slobbering over the reef; shutting\r\none’s eyes one might have fancied a giant shuddering and catching his\r\nbreath and sobbing to himself.\r\n\r\nGaspard stood for a long time watching the moving life of the lagoon,\r\nabsorbed, as a child might be before the contents of an aquarium.\r\nHe had forgotten Loneliness for a moment, but she had not forgotten\r\nhim. As he stood with his eyes fixed on a large fish, sapphire and\r\nmist-grey, that had developed like a spirit and was now hanging\r\nmotionless with moving gills above the ship, casting a vague shadow\r\nupon the coral-crusted deck; as he stood watching it, the breeze\r\nstrengthened, stirring his hair, and on the breeze a voice hailed him,\r\nfar away and weary.\r\n\r\n“Hi! Hi! Hi!—you there on the reef. Hi! Hi! Hi!—you there\r\nalone!—alone!—alone!—see how the wind takes us, wheeling, fishing,\r\nforever—alone—alone—alone.”\r\n\r\nHe turned his face to where, across the islet, far away in the blue,\r\nthe gulls’ white wings were winking and beckoning to him; their voices,\r\nthinned by distance, had a desolation rendered even more desolate by\r\nthe gorgeour of the burning blue sky, the triumphant sunlight, the\r\nlicking of the warm weak wind.\r\n\r\nThere is no desolation so terrible as the desolation that lies\r\nin summer warmth and blue skies. Here life ought to have been\r\nsuperabundant, but here there was no life or moving thing save the wind\r\nand the gulls and the waves.\r\n\r\n“God!” said the Moco. He thrust his clenched fist in his pocket and,\r\nturning from the lagoon, made his way along the rocks to the shore.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the south of the islet, not through the bushes, but\r\nalong the eastern sea-edge where the reefs were like rows of teeth and\r\nthe rock edges like razors. Here it was that most of the wreckage of\r\nthe _Rhone_ had come ashore, and here there was still wreckage enough,\r\nin all truth. Here was something to do.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he was up to his knees in water. The _Rhone_, when the\r\nexplosion of the boilers rent her asunder, had cast wreckage enough\r\nupon the water, but even still, as she lay beneath the surface, sinking\r\nmore and more completely to ruin, things were breaking loose from her\r\nand rising as bubbles rise from a submerged body, and drifting ashore\r\nwith the tide. Hencoops, boxes, spars, barrels, were pounding about in\r\nthe surf. Heavy spars were here, all chawn and frayed by the reefs; the\r\ncoral teeth had left their marks on everything; there was nothing worth\r\nsalving, yet Gaspard worked like a dock labourer, hauling upon spars,\r\nheaving at barrels, forgetting Loneliness in the exertion of manual\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nBut she was there, and her voice forever speaking, subtle, like a music\r\ninterpenetrating all things from the sound of the wave to the silence\r\nof the sky, made itself heard again.\r\n\r\nAs the power of friction brings a machine to a pause, so did this\r\nvoice, which was a part of the sunlight, a part of the silence, a part\r\nof the blueness of sea and sky, bring Gaspard to a stand.\r\n\r\nHe wiped his brow and looked at the heap of things he had collected.\r\nHe remembered how Yves had laboured at the same job, and now, for the\r\nfirst time since the tragedy, as he stood looking at the heap of spars\r\nand wreckwood, a feeling of pity came to his heart for the man lying\r\nthere dead amidst the bay-cedar bushes.\r\n\r\nThe outburst of grief to which he had given way on the evening before\r\nwas, to speak truth, an outpouring of his southern nature; anger\r\nsuddenly checked and flung back by Death, inverted and bursting forth\r\nfuriously at the sight of the irreparable result of his anger.\r\n\r\nBut this feeling of pity for Yves came from the depths of his soul, for\r\nit was born of pity for himself.\r\n\r\nIt was fatal for this feeling to enter his heart just now, for the\r\nheart, softening towards the dead, opened the door for superstition to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nHe thought of the tent over there beneath the palms and how pleasant it\r\nwould be if, on his return, he were to find Yves sitting by the tent.\r\nThen, with a chill of horror, came the idea—how awful it would be if\r\non his return he were to find Yves sitting by the tent! His imaginative\r\nmind played with this idea for a moment and then cast it hurriedly\r\naway. He laughed out loud to reassure himself, and the steady wash of\r\nthe sea made answer and the distant gulls. Then, leaving the salvage\r\nbleaching in the burning sunlight, he came towards the southern beach.\r\n\r\nNo; there was nobody by the tent, but the wind was playing with a\r\nloose corner of the sail-cloth, flapping it about. The tent seemed\r\nbeckoning to him as he came towards it across the white, blazing\r\nsands. Everything—every sound, every gesture of animate or inanimate\r\nnature, was beginning to have a deep and extraordinary significance\r\nfor Gaspard. The silence, the sunlight, and the blueness had first\r\nconspired to shew him his loneliness; the gulls had insisted on it,\r\ngloated over it, explained it; but now, since over there by the\r\nwreckwood the pity for Yves and his fate had entered into his heart,\r\nthe gulls, the silence, the sunlight, and the blueness were speaking\r\na language less assured. “Are you alone? Hi! you there on the sands,\r\nwhat’s that beckoning to you? Hi! Hi! The wind flaps the tent? Ha! ha!\r\nHi!”—and then silence for a moment, and then, weak, weary, querulous,\r\nfrom the circling white spirits away there in the smoky blue of\r\nmidday—“Yves—Yves—Yves.”\r\n\r\nThe very poetry of Loneliness, Distance, Blueness, Regret—fatal regret.\r\n\r\nGaspard fastened up the flap, and the wind, as if vexed at being robbed\r\nof its plaything, shook the palm fronds, and then some of the finest\r\nof the sand on the beach gathered itself up into a little sand devil\r\nand danced away on the wind. An unseen hand seemed moving everywhere\r\nfitfully, now here, now there, touching the sand, touching the trees,\r\ntouching the bay-cedar bushes. Gaspard, as he lay with his head in the\r\nshade of the tent resting after his exertion, listened to the faint\r\npatter of the palm fronds and the whisper of the sand; sometimes the\r\nsail-cloth of the tent would lift a bit to the wind.\r\n\r\nIt was only the wind, yet it moved like a living thing. Sometimes he\r\nimagined a hand lifting the tent-cloth back and a voice saying, “Hullo!\r\nwhat are you doing here?” He imagined Yves as the possessor of the\r\nvoice, and he drove the imagination from his mind.\r\n\r\nNever for a moment did he feel fear of the body lying away there amidst\r\nthe bushes; not for the worth of the _Rhone_ would he have gone through\r\nthe bushes to look at it and see how it was faring at the hands of\r\ncorruption, yet he felt no fear of it; on the contrary, it was the\r\nthing he dwelt on when he wished to allay fear. For fear, faint and\r\nindefinable, was taking hold upon him now. He had no compunction about\r\nthe part he had played in the death of Yves. The thing was an accident,\r\nso he told himself; all the same, men who die suddenly and violently\r\nhave a habit of haunting the place where they die.\r\n\r\nYou can run from a haunted house, but you cannot run from a haunted\r\nisland. This dread of no escape was what formed the true basis of his\r\nfear, a thing on which to build terrible and fantastic edifices. He\r\nlit a pipe and, smoking it, he fell asleep, awakening in an hour or so\r\nrefreshed and fearless. Sleep seemed to have wiped away Loneliness,\r\nsuperstition, and all their attendant evils. He felt hungry, and\r\ngetting some tinned meat and biscuit from the store of provisions which\r\nlay close to the trees he dined after a fashion, and then lit a pipe.\r\n\r\nIt was now half-past three, the gulls had ceased crying and afternoon\r\nlay on the island like a hot, heavy hand. So still seemed everything\r\nthat one might have fancied the islet wrapped in idyllic peace; but it\r\nwas the peace that broods over fermentation. The air over the sands was\r\nshaking in waves and a faint hum of insect life came from the bushes. A\r\ntorrid and tremendous pyramid of light stood upon nature, crushing her\r\nto silence yet unable to stifle her faint fret and murmur.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock Gaspard was standing at the end of the little pier of\r\ncoral reef just at the place where he had been standing yesterday, when\r\nYves’ voice had called him to see the treasure. There were no fish\r\nvisible in the water to-day, nothing floated there but an occasional\r\nscrap of seaweed. The clear water, bright as a diamond and green as an\r\nemerald, held the gaze with the fascination that lies in a globe of\r\ncrystal. Out here at the end of the projecting spur of reef, with the\r\nsea on either side, one felt as though one were standing on the deck of\r\na boat.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant out here with the sea coming in gently around the\r\nrocks, leaving scarcely a trace of foam, scarcely a trace of sound;\r\nthe islet was singing to the little waves, but the reef only gurgled,\r\nslobbered slightly when a higher ridge of swell lapped the more exposed\r\nportions, and sighed as the water sinking exposed the weeds, the\r\nclinging shells, and the coralline growths.\r\n\r\nGaspard, standing, looking into the green depths, mesmerized by their\r\ncrystal clearness and thinking of nothing, was suddenly brought to\r\nconsciousness by the feeling that someone was standing close behind\r\nhim. He wheeled round. Nothing. The reef, the islet, sea and sky were\r\ndestitute of life, yet distinctly he had felt as though someone were\r\nstanding behind him, almost in touch with him, almost breathing upon\r\nhis neck; and he felt that if he had turned more sharply he would have\r\ncaught sight of the viewless one; and the reef, the islet, sea and sky,\r\nhad for a moment a simpering look, as though they had succeeded in the\r\ntrick of snatching the Unseen One away before he could be glimpsed.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of this idea destroyed it almost as soon as it was born.\r\nHe shook the sensation off with a little shiver and, casting his eyes\r\nover the sea-line again as if in search for a ship, he began to walk\r\nalong the reef back to the shore.\r\n\r\nHe was stepping from the reef on to the sand, when upon the sand he saw\r\nsomething that brought his breathing to a stop. The imprint of a naked\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nIt was a foot-mark left by Yves, and there was nothing supernatural\r\nabout it at all; it had been left on the previous day, and it was still\r\nsharp and clear, for a ledge of the reef had protected it from the wind\r\nand the blowing sand; but to Gaspard it was more terrible than the\r\nnaked face of Death.\r\n\r\nHe walked away from the terrible thing with his hand clutching at his\r\nheart, his eyes cast from side to side, not daring to look back. He did\r\nnot know where he was going, but his feet led him to the palm clump.\r\n\r\nHere he sat down with his back to a tree bole. The terror was behind\r\nhim and the tree seemed to fend it off. The tree was a living thing;\r\nall at once it had stepped out of the semi-inanimate world where trees\r\ndwell and flowers, and had become a living personality. In his supreme\r\nterror he could have turned and embraced it, but he was afraid for a\r\nmoment to move from his position, just as a man is afraid to move who,\r\nattacked by enemies, has his back to a wall.\r\n\r\nSuch terror does not last in its entirety for more than a brief space\r\nof time. Reason came to his assistance. He remembered that Yves had\r\nbeen by the reef end on the day before. The foot-mark was a real thing.\r\nNo ghost could have left it.\r\n\r\nHe was telling himself this when,\r\n\r\n“Hi! Hi! Hi!”\r\n\r\nLoud, shrill, heart-snatching came a hail right from behind him. It was\r\nthe voice of Yves, and springing to his feet with a scream, Gaspard,\r\nclinging to the tree-bole, looked.\r\n\r\nA great black man-o’-war bird with bright eyes and coral-red beak was\r\npassing over the islet and hailing it as it passed.\r\n\r\nTremendous, definite, and strong against the blue, yet more soundless\r\nin flight than an arrow, it passed overhead without a motion of the\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nAs it passed it hailed the island once again, and once again from far\r\nout at sea, motionless, but fast dwindling till it became a faint speck\r\nand was lost in the blue to southward.\r\n\r\nGaspard, breathing freely again, watched the great bird losing itself\r\nin nothingness, lifting veil after veil of sky, and horizon after\r\nhorizon of sea, bound for some port of call in the Windwards or beyond.\r\n\r\nThe shock had been better than medicine to him, shewing him his own\r\nsuperstition and the stupidity of his alarm. The island seemed suddenly\r\nfreed from the haunting presence; he began to doubt himself. If a bird\r\ncould make a fool of him like that, he must be a fool indeed.\r\n\r\nA year seemed to have passed since sunrise and the sun was now dropping\r\nto the sea, bringing to its end that vast blue day so filled with\r\nloneliness and the terrors of the unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE BOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of us have never known the day as it is and the night as it is.\r\nProtected from the wind and the sunlight by walls and houses, by\r\nartificial light from the darkness, by words from the truth, we have\r\ncreated an artificial world in the midst of the true world. In the\r\nwind, in the sunlight, in the sea, there are voices speaking a language\r\nlong forgotten; lost when thought, becoming vocal, set up a language of\r\nits own and a tower of Babel in the world of dreams. Even still, when\r\nalone in the solitudes, on the moors, on the mountains, by the sea,\r\nthrough all the claptrap of language and thought come the voices; the\r\ntrue, eternal voices that were before we were and will be when we are\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nVoices of which all art, in marble, in tone, or in words, is but the\r\npathetic imitation, an echo dulled and muffled and debased. In this\r\nlies the eternal despair of art.\r\n\r\nTo the mind of the commonest man, if he be imaginative, the language\r\nof the eternal things is louder far than to the mind of the most\r\ncultivated man if he be only imitative.\r\n\r\nGaspard’s mind was of the imaginative order. Up to this, in the\r\nforecastle or stokehold, on board ship or on shore, he had been held\r\napart by his fellows or protected by the common things from the eternal\r\ntruths. Loneliness in her extremest form had brought him in touch with\r\nthem; or at least within whispering distance.\r\n\r\nThe great blue day, dying now, had searched his heart and mind; it\r\nwas as though the old gods of nature had landed on the island and\r\nstood around him viewless and perplexing him with whispers. Fear, Air,\r\nDistance, Light, and Sea had spoken to him in turn and in chorus;\r\nLoneliness had echoed what they said.\r\n\r\nThere was something more in the wind and the sun and the sky and the\r\nsea than he had known of up to this; the drinking-bar, the forecastle,\r\nthe sailors’ lodging-house, those black holes had hidden him from this\r\nknowledge; a debased language in which the word “sea” stood for wharves\r\nand ships, stokeholds and furnaces, decks and glimpses of ocean had\r\nparalysed his thought and numbed it. Twelve hours of loneliness and\r\nfear, face to face with nature, had loosened the old false labels from\r\nthe truths of things and, without a glimpse of the real truths, a dim\r\nrecognition of the falsities unsettled his mind.\r\n\r\nThe damning mesmerism of language had suspended itself partly for a\r\nmoment in this partly unsophisticated mind, and as he sat watching\r\nthe sun sink in the western sea, the word “sunset” or the word “sea”\r\nnever occurred to him. He was thinking without language, lost in\r\ncontemplation, like an animal viewing from a distance a new and curious\r\nbut undisturbing phenomenon.\r\n\r\nAnd the sight was tremendous as ten million cubic leagues of golden air\r\ncould make it. Fire, Light, and Distance were there at this marriage\r\nof sun and ocean; colour, size, limit, all were banished from the\r\ninfinite, indefinite universe of gold through which the golden sun was\r\nsinking to the golden sea.\r\n\r\nThe sun had almost reached the sea-line and for a moment Ocean and\r\nSun hung apart, the splendour of the sea answering the splendour of\r\nthe sky. For a moment time seemed to cease and silence supreme,\r\neverlasting, golden, and beautiful, held the West in her keeping.\r\n\r\nA moment—and then, flashing, palpitating, leaping like a woman under a\r\nburning kiss, the great sea flung her arms up to her lover.\r\n\r\nDestroying him utterly and almost in a moment, washing him away,\r\nmelting him as though he who had been fire had become wax and the wax\r\nhad been cast into a cauldron of boiling gold. Then, as if millions\r\nof infinitely tenuous golden veils were being stripped away with the\r\nrapidity of thought, bluer and bluer, darker and darker, appeared the\r\nnight behind them.\r\n\r\nA hand seemed sprinkling and spraying the sky with stars.\r\n\r\nOne could scarcely say, “It is night,” before night had taken\r\npossession of the world and the night-wind was blowing in the palms.\r\n\r\nGaspard, rising, stretched himself and then crept under the shelter of\r\nthe tent; the opiate of the sea air and his weariness brought sleep at\r\nonce, profound, dreamless sleep which lasted till just before dawn.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened by a sound.\r\n\r\nSomeone close to the tent had, so it seemed to him, struck a single\r\nblow on a drum. He raised himself on his arm; sleep had fallen from him\r\nlike a cloak, and his mind was alert again, and alive to fear.\r\n\r\nHe listened, but heard nothing except the weary washing sound of the\r\nwaves on the beach.\r\n\r\nThen, as he listened, it came again, but from a distance. Boom! A\r\nmonstrous sound in that desolate place, alarming and uncanny as the\r\nsound of a trumpet.\r\n\r\nIf it were a drum note, then, judging by the sound, the drum must be of\r\nGargantuan size.\r\n\r\nWith the sweat running from his face he crept out from under the tent\r\nand stood beneath the trees.\r\n\r\nNothing. The new moon had risen and was floating like a little silver\r\nboat amidst the stars; the starlight flooded the sea and brimmed over\r\non to the foam. So solid was the sky with stars that the palm fronds\r\ncut their silhouettes on it sharply and distinctly. Never was there a\r\nmore lovely southern night.\r\n\r\nAs he stood and listened, again, from very far away this time, came the\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nBoom! As though the drummer had stridden away leagues across the sea to\r\nbeat his drum around the world before dawn.\r\n\r\nHad Gaspard known these waters the sound would have had less terror\r\nfor him. It was the sound of great devil-fish, sea-bats that rise from\r\nthe water, quiver for a moment in the air, and then fall, smashing the\r\nwaves to foam, with a noise that reverberates for miles. But he knew\r\nnothing of the sea-bats, and he stood pursuing in his mind the drummer\r\nwho had beaten this strange _réveil_ and with his eyes fixed on the\r\nhorizon to eastward where the sky was stained by the dawn.\r\n\r\nIt came, killing the stars, clear and cold in tint, beneath a sky\r\nshifting in colour from smoke-grey to aquamarine and icy blue. Then\r\nit bloomed into warmth and kindness of tone. Just as children hold\r\nbuttercups to one another’s faces to see the yellow reflection, so\r\none might suppose some hand beneath the horizon was holding a vast\r\nbuttercup to the dawn’s pallid face.\r\n\r\nA thread of living gold stole along the sea-line, became a fiery,\r\nmoving caterpillar, and, at a stroke, the last stars were washed away,\r\ndissolving in blueness and infinite distance, the sun was peeping\r\nacross the water and then suddenly, as though he had taken a leap\r\nelbow-high and elbow resting on the sea-line, he leaned forward and\r\nstruck the world in the face with his great golden hand.\r\n\r\nHad you been watching Gaspard, as he stood with the dawn wind blowing\r\nhis hair, you would have seen the stroke of the sun’s hand on his face,\r\non the palms behind him, on the sea before him, suddenly given as a\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nThe same hand was striking the Bahamas, and in a hundred blue harbours\r\nfrom Cape Sable to Port of Spain ships’ topmasts were catching the\r\nlight. Martinique, Guadeloupe, Grenada, peak, morne, and valley, were\r\nalready flaming to it like green torches in the dawn wind. Key West\r\nwould be stricken in a moment and the gulf to Galveston and Tampico be\r\nturned from a lake of stars to a living sapphire, the Caribbean would\r\nleap alive from Grand Cayman to Darien, from San Juan to La Guaira,\r\nalive and burning and blue. The wind that was blowing in Gaspard’s\r\nface, a wind that came over the blue and laughter of the morning sea\r\nlike a wind from the golden age and the youth of the world, held\r\nfreshness for the orange groves and the gardens of all these Western\r\nislands where the night jessamines were closing, the night insects\r\nceasing their songs, and the fireflies preparing to put out their lamps.\r\n\r\nGaspard knew nothing of that tremendous poem in colour which the dawn\r\nshows to God each time she lifts the darkness from the tropics; just\r\nnow he did not even see the sunrise and its splendour, he had, for a\r\nmoment, forgotten even his fears; his eyes were fixed on an object\r\nabout a mile away to the southeast, something round and black that\r\nbobbed in the sparkle and glitter of the water.\r\n\r\nIt was like the head of a swimmer, and now it was like a drifting buoy.\r\nIt was drawing nearer, the current was setting it towards the island,\r\nand now—it was like a boat.\r\n\r\nIt was a boat!\r\n\r\nThere could be no mistake; it underwent alterations of shape as it\r\ntwisted to the slap of the waves, now head on for the island, now\r\nnearly broadside on.\r\n\r\nA boat—release from the islet and its dreams and terrors! The cry that\r\nescaped from Gaspard seemed echoed by the gulls.\r\n\r\nHe made for the pier of coral reef, running along the sand to it,\r\nforgetful of everything, never glancing at the place where the\r\nfootsteps of Yves had been, scrambling over the coral till he reached\r\nthe extreme end, where, surrounded by the morning sea, and the wind,\r\nand the light, he shaded his eyes and watched.\r\n\r\nThe boat was now plainly in view dancing on the waves with the\r\nlightness of a walnut shell on the ripple of a pond. It was empty and\r\ndrifting towards the islet, but it would not touch the beach, it would\r\npass by a few hundred yards; he saw that, and he prepared for the event\r\nby casting off his clothes.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a small boat midway between a dinghy and a ship’s\r\nquarterboat, and never to Gaspard’s eyes had anything appeared so gay\r\nin motion or so friendly as this tiny craft dancing upon the waves.\r\n\r\nAt a distance it had seemed black, but now he saw that it was painted\r\nwhite; it was clinker built, for, so clear was the air, he could see\r\nthe overlapping planks, and now as he stood preparing to take to the\r\nwater and swim to it, the terror of the islet which he had shaken off\r\nfor a moment came behind him again, and at once held him back and urged\r\nhim forward.\r\n\r\nWhat if the Terror followed him into the sea? Behind him there seemed\r\na deadly enemy filled with wrath at his attempt to escape, and, for\r\na moment, the want of power that comes to us in nightmare held him\r\nshivering in the wind, the next he was in the sea, striking out for the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nHe had to swim against the current that was carrying it, the waves hit\r\nhim in the face like wet hands trying to drive him back; but the shock\r\nof the plunge had given him his courage.\r\n\r\nThe boat was close now, beautiful and buoyant, and white as a gull,\r\nsmacking the sea as she came, shining with spray, the green water under\r\nher showing clear as an emerald. Now, she was only an arm’s length\r\naway, and now, he was grasping the starboard thwart. She heeled over\r\nslightly as he got his elbow on the thwart and peeped in. She was empty\r\nof everything but the bottom boards and a pair of sculls, clean scoured\r\nwith spray; a dead flying-fish was lying washing about in the few\r\ninches of water she had shipped; it was newly dead and had struck her\r\nonly perhaps an hour ago.\r\n\r\nHe worked his way round to the stern, boarded her and stood upright.\r\n\r\nHe was free of the island at last, but he would have to land to get his\r\nclothes and some provisions and water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment balancing himself, his eyes sweeping the sky-line\r\nto southward, which shewed neither sail nor stain of smoke, and as he\r\nstood he heard the island calling to him.\r\n\r\n“Hi! Hi! Hi! you there in the boat! come back! come back! Hi! Think you\r\nto escape us? Ha! ha!—hi! Fishing, wheeling, calling, O the weariness,\r\nthe blueness, the waves, the wind, the sun; they are ours and they are\r\nyours, forever—forever—forever. Hi!”\r\n\r\nThrough the voices of the gulls came the monotonous tune of the beach\r\nacross the bright morning sea. The tent flap had got loose again and\r\nwas beckoning. Come what might, provisions and water must be taken on\r\nboard and the clothes he had left on the reef spar recovered.\r\n\r\nHe felt like a man who had just escaped from a haunted house, yet he\r\nhad to go back. To land again on that terrible spot and leave the boat\r\nwhilst he hunted for the things was an act requiring real courage, but\r\nit had to be done.\r\n\r\nHe got the sculls out and, rowing towards the strand, beached the boat\r\ncleverly. There was no danger in leaving her, as the tide was ebbing;\r\nthe only danger was in delay, for if the water receded too far, he\r\nwould not be able to get her afloat again till high tide.\r\n\r\nJumping out knee-deep, he hauled her nose a little higher on the sand,\r\nthen, running like a man pursued, he made for the tent, seized the\r\nbelt and the pouch of money, made for the heap of provisions, seized\r\na bag of biscuits and some tinned stuff, and with his arms filled\r\nreturned to the boat.\r\n\r\nIt was a nightmare business, for the vague fears of yesterday had\r\nbecome more definite, as though the near chance of escape had given\r\nthem life. He felt Yves behind him as he ran, sweating as he ran,\r\nfrom the boat to the store of provisions and back to the boat. An\r\nempty water-breaker from the _Rhone_ lay near the tent. This had to be\r\nfilled; the spring was amidst the bushes, yet he made his way there,\r\ncrushing the brushwood under his naked feet, his breath coming in\r\nbursts, his lips dry as sandstone. Yves had not caught him yet, as,\r\nthe breaker on his shoulder, he came running back to the boat. He\r\nflung it in; the clothes, now, had to be fetched, the worst part of\r\nthe business, for it was fifty yards down the beach to the ridge of\r\nreef and the clothes were at the extremity of the reef. But it had to\r\nbe done, and he ran, sweating yet shivering, worked up to the wildest\r\npitch of excitement, by the sea edge to the shore end of the reef.\r\n\r\nHe was without his boots,—he had forgotten that,—and the reef was\r\nsharp and rough; there were edges like knives that had to be avoided,\r\ndrive Fear as she might. This was the place where Yves had first stood\r\nbehind him in imagination, and it was here, now, that the pursuing\r\nterror was most acute.\r\n\r\nAt last, bleeding, panting, with shaking hands, he reached the clothes.\r\nHe put on the boots and with the coat, shirt, and trousers under his\r\nleft arm, came back swiftly along the reef, sprang on to the sand, and,\r\nrunning, shouting, gesticulating with his free arm, made for the boat.\r\n\r\nHe was shouting at the boat; she was there safe enough and in full\r\nsight; yet viewless hands seemed preparing to push her off; she would\r\nbe gone before he reached her, the island would never let him escape.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached her he brought his open hand bang down on the gunwale\r\nas if to make sure she was really there, flung in the clothes and then\r\ntried to push her off.\r\n\r\nThe tide had ebbed more quickly than he had imagined. She was firm on\r\nthe sand. It was a two men’s business to float her and he never would\r\nhave done it, had he been alone; but he was not alone. Fear was with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe boat gave to his efforts, shifting slightly, then more and more,\r\ntill she moved stem and stern to the lifting waves and was afloat.\r\n\r\nHe tumbled into her and she came broadside on to the strand; but the\r\nwaves were less than two feet high and with one of the sculls he\r\nmanaged to pole her out, then, seizing both sculls, he rowed.\r\n\r\nHe was free of the island at last; sculls and current were sweeping\r\nhim from it into the wastes of the blue sea; the water, all merry with\r\nthe breeze, smacked the boat cheerily and flashed away and away, in\r\nthe level sunlight to where the palms were waving, and the foam was\r\nbreaking, and the sea gulls calling.\r\n\r\n“Come back!—come back!—you are leaving us, but our voices are\r\nfollowing you. Go far as you may, our voices will follow you, our\r\nweariness, the sunlight, the blueness shall be yours forever—you there\r\nin the boat alone, where is Yves—Yves—Yves?”\r\n\r\nThen, more far away, the last word, the last echo from the island,\r\n\r\n“Yves—Yves—Yves.”\r\n\r\nNow, there was nothing but the passing of the wind, the sound of the\r\nsculls, and the warbling of the water. There were no waves here, the\r\nshallows and the reefs had made the sea choppy close to the island;\r\nhere there was nothing but a heave of the sea, long lapses of swell,\r\ninfinitely blue, breeze-strewn and sun-dazzled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA STAR ON THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island had passed away, painted out by distance; the sky above the\r\nhorizon, paled by the indigo of the sea, lay like a ring of sparkling\r\nemerald; to southward, where the emerald passed into the living burning\r\nsapphire of the sky, lay a line of white clouds, swan-white and like\r\na flock of flying swans, darkening with their suggestion of snow the\r\nblueness of the water, deepening with their remoteness the distance.\r\n\r\nThe warm wind blew steadily sparkling up the blue, the incredible blue\r\nof the sea; the scull-blades, immersed half a foot in the water, were\r\ntinted with azure, the floating scraps of seaweed were tinted with\r\nindigo; a man floating a yard deep would have shewn like a form of\r\nlazulite.\r\n\r\nGaspard had drawn in his sculls; free of the island now, what use was\r\nthere in rowing? He had no idea of direction, North, South, East or\r\nWest. His only chance, so he told himself, lay in his sighting a ship.\r\nHe was in the hands of chance and he did not feel afraid. Not only\r\nthat, but he felt in his mind a certainty that before long he would be\r\nrescued.\r\n\r\nThe relief of his escape from the island may have had something to do\r\nwith this intuitive optimism, and the fact that he had provisions and\r\nwater enough to last him for days. Loneliness had vanished; he had left\r\nher behind on the island, she and Yves.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like a bad dream, all that, and Yves was the worst part of\r\nit. He felt neither sorrow nor compunction for what had happened. Why\r\nshould he? He had not meant to kill, and if he had meant to kill, would\r\nhe not have been justified? He felt nothing of remorse, nothing of that\r\npity for the dead man which had come to him yesterday, when, standing\r\nby the reefs on the eastward of the island, he had looked at the heap\r\nof raffle he had salved. He had suffered too much since then to have\r\nany sentimental feelings on the matter. Haunted and bedevilled, he had\r\nescaped with his reason more by luck than anything else.\r\n\r\nHe dressed himself and then he sat, rocked by the swell, drifting,\r\nthe sun rising higher towards the zenith, the wind blowing steadily\r\nout of the southeast, warm as a woman’s breath. Every now and then a\r\nflying-fish like a silver arrowhead would leave the sea, flash through\r\nthe air, and vanish.\r\n\r\nTowards noon a shoal of them chased by some enemy broke the water to\r\nstarboard; one passed right over the boat, soundless in flight, swift,\r\nbrilliant against the blue, with staring sightless eyes; a phantom from\r\nthe deep pursued by a phantom, definite for a moment and hard to the\r\nsight as a jewel, gone like a ghost the moment after, made one again\r\nwith the blue sea.\r\n\r\nThe wind tempered the heat of the sun, long strips of seaweed floated\r\npast lazily, and a turtle that had been sunning itself basking on the\r\nwater’s surface, slipped away and vanished as the boat drew near. A\r\ngreat gull came along drifting on the wind, passed with the silence of\r\na moving cloud and dwindled to nothingness in the blue to northward.\r\n\r\nNothing in the world of water and sky seemed to move with effort, a\r\nprofound languor filled it all from the depths below to the heights\r\nabove, from the little boat whispering and chuckling on the ripples to\r\nthe distances of the horizon; distances that shewed nothing, told of\r\nnothing but summer, vagueness, and azure.\r\n\r\nTwo hours before sunset Gaspard standing up to get a better horizon and\r\nshading his eyes with his hand saw, away on the eastern sea line, a\r\nbright point burning like a star.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nLIKE A THIEF IN THE NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a sail.\r\n\r\nHe stood with his eyes still shaded, motionless but for the movement of\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\nFrom away out there a hand seemed to have reached clutching at his\r\nheart. The star so steadfast and so still held him by its very\r\nstillness and steadfastness. There, where the sunlight showed that\r\nmotionless point of light were crowded decks, bending spars, snoring\r\nsails, life, motion; a ship breasting her way through the blue sea,\r\nheeling to the breeze.\r\n\r\nAll that was there. Here, nothing but a star marking poignantly the\r\nvacancy of illimitable distance. The wind had freshened, it was as\r\nthough the ship had sent the joyous breath of life before her, the\r\nbreezed-up water smacked the boat merrily, and even as he looked the\r\nstar grew, lifting steadily as the mainsails joined the topsails above\r\nthe sea line.\r\n\r\nAs Gaspard watched, his confidence and assurance left him. The blind\r\ntrust in chance that had possessed him all day vanished now that chance\r\nhad shewn her hand.\r\n\r\nAt once and vividly his true position stood before him, and the\r\nhorrible chances of death that lay in it, and, so strange a thing is\r\nmind, now and for the first time did the sense of his own wealth in the\r\npossession of these twenty-one big pieces of gold take possession of\r\nhim. Side by side with the fear of not being rescued stood the vision\r\nof the possibilities that lay in them. Each one weighed as much as\r\nthree twenty-franc pieces. Six hundred and three francs; with that what\r\nmight he not do! It was the only big bit of luck that had ever fallen\r\nin his way, and it would be doubly bitter to die with his luck in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nAnd, still, as he watched, the sail grew. The vessel was not nearly\r\nso far off as she appeared; for the boat gave a low horizon. For this\r\nreason, too, she seemed bigger than she really was. That she was\r\nheading straight for the boat he could not doubt, yet he stood torn by\r\nthe fear that she would miss him, pass him by, not sight him.\r\n\r\nHis imaginative mind saw her passing, saw her fading away, saw himself\r\nstanding and calling after her and cursing her; so vivid was the\r\nobsession that for a moment, as he drew the picture, blazing wrath shot\r\nup in his heart towards her captain, curses rose to his lips, and sweat\r\nstarted on his brow.\r\n\r\nThen he wiped his face with his coat sleeve, and unable to remain in\r\nidleness a moment longer, took the sculls and headed the boat for the\r\npoint from which the vessel was approaching.\r\n\r\nUseless, the moment his back was turned on the sail it was gone from\r\nhis mind as from his sight. He had to keep it in view and shifting his\r\nposition with the sculls half drawn in, he sat watching.\r\n\r\nHe had not so good an horizon sitting as standing, yet the sail had\r\nsensibly increased in size even allowing for the altered elevation.\r\n\r\nWith a dip of the sculls he kept the boat so that he was always\r\nfacing the approaching vision, and sitting thus the picture before\r\nhim resolved itself into three components: the after part of the\r\nboat, white, clean-scoured by spray, and burning in the sun with the\r\nexception of the space covered by his shadow; the blue of sea and sky;\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nSeated, with the sculls ready to correct the boat when she twisted to\r\nthe wind and the current, his eyes passed from the boat to the far-off\r\nship, from the ship to the sea and sky.\r\n\r\nAnd still she grew, as a child grows in the womb, as an idea in the\r\nmind, adding member to member, significance to significance. He could\r\nsee now the fore topsail distinct from the fore course. She was a\r\nsquare rigged vessel as to the fore part, but coming as she was, the\r\nspread of fore and topsails screened her rig.\r\n\r\nShe had altered, too, in colour; the frost white star was now a\r\ntruncated pyramid of pale but brilliant rose, around which the deep\r\nblue heart of the sky paled to emerald by contrast.\r\n\r\nAnd still she grew, motionless, or seeming not to move, yet becoming\r\nmore definite, expanding as a bud expands, voiceless, and like a vision\r\ndeveloping in a dream.\r\n\r\nMoment joined itself to moment, minute to minute. She might now be ten\r\nmiles away, or maybe more, her course would bring her directly to the\r\nboat and she would sight it to a certainty _if she had light_.\r\n\r\nIt was his own shadow cast by the oblique rays of the sun on seat and\r\nbottom board and thwart that suggested the chilling clause.\r\n\r\nThe sun was little more than an hour from his setting; would he cut the\r\nsea line before the vessel sighted the boat?\r\n\r\nIt was a race between the sun and the ship. He knew quite well that\r\nthough she was coming apparently dead on to him, the chances were that\r\nshe might pass him by a considerable distance, and, as though the\r\nthought had cast a blight on her, for a long time she hung, not seeming\r\nto alter in size. Then magically, she took distinctness, mystery and\r\nbeauty left her; in a short half hour she became clearly defined, a\r\nsmall vessel of perhaps two hundred tons, at a distance of perhaps five\r\nmiles. She would not be doing more than eight or nine knots.\r\n\r\nGaspard looked behind him at the sun. It had outraced the ship, there\r\nwere still diameters between it and the horizon, but the western blue\r\nwas just beginning to turn, to tinge with vague orange, as though an\r\nimpalpable mist of gold dust were rising from the sea.\r\n\r\nBut now the ship, as a runner strains when near the goal, seemed\r\nstraining to reach him. Moment by moment she leapt nearer, and the old\r\nstained sails that had lost the vague rose of distance caught now the\r\nfirst touch of gold from the sunset.\r\n\r\nThe eastern sky still held its blue, and against it the ship burned\r\nlike a ship of gold, and before her prow the water divided like\r\nglittering silk cut by a golden sword.\r\n\r\nScarcely a mile away she leapt more triumphantly into life, she seemed\r\nwithin hail; standing up and stripping off his coat Gaspard waved it,\r\nshouting against the wind, delirious, forgetful of distance, forgetful\r\nof the sun and then—just as though a bad wizard had touched her she\r\nbegan to lose her brilliancy; she had seemed springing towards him with\r\ngolden arms outspread, triumphant, and seeking to save him and then,\r\njust as though indifference had suddenly seized her, she seemed to lose\r\nher speed.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head. God! the sun was gone, just a trace of fire\r\nlingered beneath the gold of the sunset, through which, like a dark\r\nblue wind, was stealing the night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe vessel from a ship had turned to a phantom lost in a world of\r\nviolent shadow. With the passing of the sun the breeze fell away\r\nto a gentle breathing of air. Then, in that moment of darkness and\r\nindecision, before the stars have taken full possession of the sky,\r\nstanding up and straining his eyes he could not see the ship at all.\r\n\r\nAh! here she came at last, stealing along in the starlight with sails\r\njust filling and, then, more clearly to view as ten million stars lit\r\nthe sea, turning it to frosted silver.\r\n\r\nAt four knots without a light showing, softly and seeming the very\r\nembodiment of treachery and evasion she came. She would pass by some\r\nfive cable lengths to starboard and Gaspard, seizing the sculls turned\r\nthe boat’s head to cut her off.\r\n\r\nAs he rowed he shouted, and had anyone on board heard him they might\r\nhave fancied it, so thin and hard was his voice, the crying of a sea\r\ngull, but from all appearances no one heard him, for not a light shewed.\r\n\r\nNow she bulked up enormous, a great trapezium of ebony cutting the\r\nsilver sky; he ceased rowing, shouted again, and paused to listen. So\r\nclose was she that he could hear the wash of the water at her fore\r\nfoot, the creaking of blocks and the slatting of the scarcely filled\r\nsails.\r\n\r\nScarcely a cable length away and making to pass him by half that\r\ndistance she came, black as ebony, a barquentine, silent as a phantom,\r\nstealthy as a thief. Then, as he hailed her again with a last\r\ndespairing cry, she burst into voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN SAGESSE\r\n\r\n\r\nA lantern shot its light over the port quarter, a voice hailed him from\r\nthe deck:\r\n\r\n“Hi yi ow!” shrill as a bird, and at the cry, like a shaken beehive,\r\nthe forecastle broke into life; the decks in a moment were a-swarm,\r\nchattering like a tree full of monkeys, another lantern shewed over the\r\nport bow, and above the lantern a face black as the face of a devil\r\nwith glittering eyeballs and white teeth grinned down on the boat below.\r\n\r\nNext moment something struck Gaspard across the chest, it was a rope;\r\nseizing it he held on, and the little boat came up grinding against the\r\ngreat washing wall of the vessel, carried with her on her slow way and\r\nright beneath the broad channel of the foremast. He seized the rope’s\r\nend to the forward seat, caught up the belt with the pouch of gold\r\nand fastened it to his waist; then, reaching up, he caught hold of a\r\nchannelplate and with the help of another rope flung by the chattering\r\ncrowd above, swung himself on to the channel. Next moment he was on\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nThe starlight lit the decks dimly fore and aft, he was surrounded with\r\nnegroes swarming and chattering like monkeys; a man in a panama hat\r\nwho had helped him over the side, and who, disregarding him, was now\r\nshouting directions in shrill French to a black man who had slipped\r\ndown into the boat, seemed the only white man on board.\r\n\r\nHaving finished his directions he turned, kicked a negro who stood in\r\nhis way, caught up a lantern, and coming up to Gaspard held the light\r\nto him as if he were a work of art he wished to examine.\r\n\r\n“French?” said the man in the panama, speaking in that language and\r\nfixing Gaspard with a pair of beady unwinking black eyes. His face lit\r\nup by the lantern-light was round, good-tempered looking, the face of\r\na _bon bourgeois_—yet the eyes chilled Gaspard for a moment ere he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“Yes, French, shipwrecked and floating about in that cursed boat till\r\nyou nearly ran me down.”\r\n\r\n“What ship?”\r\n\r\n“The _Rhone_ of the _Compagnie Transatlantique_.”\r\n\r\n“The _Rhone_; I have seen her in Havana harbour, is she lost then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, ripped her bottom out on a reef and gone with all on board.”\r\n\r\n“You are the only one saved?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“_Boufre_!” said the other, betraying his _provence_ in the word. “A\r\nMoco, too, so was I till I became a man of my own. Well I have saved\r\nyou, and _I take the boat_! I am Captain Sagesse, and this is my barque\r\n_La Belle Arlésienne_.”\r\n\r\nHe seized Gaspard by the coat lapel as he brought the words out with\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\n“The boat is mine, you understand.”\r\n\r\n“Oh the boat, she is yours and welcome.”\r\n\r\n“She is worth five hundred francs, and a brush full of white paint\r\nwill take the _Rhone’s_ name off her. I found you on a raft—no, on a\r\nhencoop—no, on a spar—” he slipped his arm through Gaspard’s and was\r\nleading him aft to the deck-house on the poop. “You were floating on a\r\nspar. Here is the deck-house. Come in.” He opened the deck-house door\r\ndisclosing a cabin comfortably, yet roughly furnished. A table stood\r\nin the middle, over the table hung a swinging lamp. Two doors opening\r\naft gave entrance to the captain and mate’s cabins, tiny holes not much\r\nbigger than dog-kennels. The captain flung his panama on the table and\r\nGaspard took a seat, and looked at his companion who was now opening a\r\nlocker, and fetching out a bottle of rum and some glasses and a basket\r\nof ship biscuits. This roundfaced and contented looking personage had,\r\nin the first moment of their acquaintance, invented and asked him to\r\nassist in a microscopic felony. He placed his hand on the bag of gold\r\nat his side as, leaning on the table, he replied:\r\n\r\n“But, see here, that boat doesn’t belong to the _Rhone_ at all.”\r\n\r\nThe man in the panama had placed the things on the table, he turned.\r\n\r\n“But you said—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but you have not heard all; I was wrecked from the _Rhone_ right\r\nenough, on a spar too, away on an island down there, then the boat came\r\nfloating along, she has no name on her that I have seen, I got into her\r\nand rowed away—that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“_Outre_,” said Sagesse, pouring out two glasses of rum, whilst\r\nGaspard took a biscuit. The little man almost seemed disappointed; one\r\nmight have fancied that he regretted the lost chance of “doing” the\r\n_Compagnie Transatlantique_ out of a boat, then he took a Martinique\r\ncigar from his pocket, lit it, and with his elbows on the table began\r\nto talk and ask questions.\r\n\r\nHe asked questions without waiting for an answer, nay, he sometimes\r\nanswered them himself, as—\r\n\r\n“The _Rhone_, I have seen her in Havana harbour, what tonnage was she?\r\nOh, I know, seven thousand; she and the _Roxelane_ were sister ships.\r\nThe _Roxelane_ called regularly at St. Pierre. Oh, yes, I ought to know\r\nher, Martinique bred as I am. Not born, mind you. No, I was born at\r\nArles, but I have spent thirty years in these seas. One can make money\r\nin these seas, but one never can forget the old land, and you were\r\nborn at Montpellier, you say, ’tis the same thing, and all Provençals\r\nare brothers. Think you, if I picked up a Dutchlander or an English,\r\nor even a Ponantaise, I would be giving him rum in my cabin—” Then\r\nmellowed by the rum and the presence of another Provençal, he leaned\r\nhis elbows further on the table and continued talking and asking\r\nquestions without seeming to hear the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nRUM\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had done big things, had Captain Sagesse, since the day thirty\r\nyears and more ago when, deserting from a French ship, he had taken\r\nup his abode at St. Pierre. Beginning at the very bottom, he had\r\nworked his way up to comparative affluence, and whilst plying Gaspard\r\nwith questions he interpolated fragments of his own history. Captain\r\nSagesse was the only subject of very deep interest to Captain Sagesse;\r\nhad he been going to his own execution he would have cast fragments\r\nof his history to the crowd, he was a walking autobiography, and he\r\nhad been closed for three weeks, inasmuch as the crew consisting\r\nentirely of blacks, he had no one to open himself to. He told of how\r\nhe worked the vessel entirely with blacks, Barbadians, and when he had\r\nexhausted his slight interest in Gaspard and his history he returned\r\nto himself, talking as though Gaspard were an old friend just stepped\r\naboard, the freemasonry of the south and a common birthplace giving\r\nhim the familiarity of long acquaintanceship. There was scarcely a\r\ndisreputable transaction in which a ship’s keel could find a place but\r\nit seemed that Captain Sagesse and his barque, the _Belle Arlésienne_,\r\nhad been in it—gun running in the Spanish-American war, smuggling,\r\nand worse. He owned the vessel, he owned property in Martinique and\r\nvery questionable property in St. Pierre; and inspired now by rum and\r\nwhat seemed at first blush a charming and natural naïveté, he told\r\nabout himself and his doings, his possessions and aspirations with\r\ncharacteristic force and freedom.\r\n\r\nGaspard, at first half drowsy with weariness, listened like a person in\r\na dream to the chatter of the other, then, the rum beginning to take\r\neffect upon him, he found himself laughing at things which might have\r\nmade him frown if listened to in strict sobriety. He was sinner enough,\r\nbut in his small way in life he had dealt straightly with his fellows,\r\nhe had, at all events, no feeling for a scoundrel, and Captain Sagesse\r\nwas scoundrel enough, heaven knows, to judge by his conversation. He\r\nhad got the better of governments, men, and women; he gave neither\r\nnames nor dates nor places, talking in his loose way with nothing\r\nmore definite than, “It was an islet, it might have been fifty miles\r\nsouth or fifty miles north of Rum Cay—but that doesn’t matter,” or\r\n“Honorine, that might have been her name, but it wasn’t, anyhow, I’ll\r\ntell you the trick she served Pierre Sagesse, and then I’ll tell you\r\nthe trick he served her.”\r\n\r\nAll at once the brain of Gaspard, drowsed by the events of the day,\r\ncleared, perception became acute, sensation beatified, two glasses of\r\nstrong rum and the Martinique _bout_ which the Captain had given him,\r\nhad opened for him the door of the Brandy Paradise; the deck-house of\r\n_La Belle Arlésienne_ seemed palatial, Sagesse the greatest of men and\r\nhe, Gaspard Cadillac, the equal of Sagesse.\r\n\r\nHe held out his glass for more rum.\r\n\r\n“And mark you,” said Sagesse as he poured it out, “I got my hold on her\r\nin that way, because, _mordieu_, I remembered those two words she said\r\nthat night to the mate of the _Bayonnaise_. They thought I was drunk,\r\nbut I have never been drunk in my life, and I never forget.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I,” said Gaspard, “never been drunk and never forget.” The\r\nrecollection of Anisette and Yves came up in his mind, and he thumped\r\nthe table with his fist. “I have served my man out. No, I never forget.\r\nNow you listen—” But Sagesse was off on another tack, money business\r\nthis time, and Gaspard rocking unsteadily in his seat with his eyes\r\ninjected, the cigar in the corner of his mouth, and his fists clenched\r\non the table before him, sat hearing nothing, glorified in the hideous\r\nupset of alcohol, filled with the splendour of his own importance, and\r\ntormented on his throne by something, he knew not what, but which took\r\nthe form of Yves.\r\n\r\nIt was the woman of Marseilles still working like a demon at his heart\r\nand brought into full life by the drink. The feeling that another man\r\nhad done him out. That another man had been preferred to him. That\r\nanother man was a better animal, even though that man was dead. Alcohol\r\ntold him that he was glorious, supreme, a man amongst men. Anisette\r\nlike a pale, sneering ghost said “Pshaw. Where is Yves. _You_, you are\r\nnothing to a woman.”\r\n\r\n“And it was worth seven thousand dollars American gold coin,” Sagesse\r\nwas saying in the course of his yarn, when Gaspard, whipping the belt\r\nand pouch from his waist, brought them down on the table with a bang,\r\nso that the gold coins rolled out.\r\n\r\n“Look at that,” cried Gaspard. “What you say? Wasn’t that worth the\r\nthrust of a knife?” The coins danced before him as he sat rocking in\r\nhis seat, an abstemious man as a rule, the weariness and the strong old\r\nrum had done their work.\r\n\r\nSagesse stopped short in his story, stared at the belt and the gold and\r\nthen at the man before him. Sagesse, though he chattered of his own\r\ndoings, never by any chance gave a man a handle to use against him;\r\nhis tales were as vague, all save the villainy of them, as clouds; his\r\none weakness was talking and he knew it and guarded against it, the\r\nvillainies he boasted of were all apocryphal; based they were on black\r\ndeeds, just as clouds are based on mountains, the scoundrel in him had\r\nto boast, but to bring Sagesse to book on one of his stories would be\r\nlike attempting to bring a bird to earth by grasping at its shadow on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nMen had tried to blackmail this _raconteur_ on the strength of his\r\nstatements; to bring the vulture to earth by catching at his shadow,\r\nonly to find themselves in the vulture’s clutch, blackmailed themselves\r\nmost cruelly. And he never let go as long as his clutch held, and there\r\nwas a feather on the victim. But though he chattered fables, he knew\r\nwhen to be silent in face of facts. He was silent now. He laughed but\r\nsaid nothing for a moment, whilst Gaspard gathering the coins together\r\nin a heap, reiterated his question.\r\n\r\n“What you say—isn’t that worth the thrust of a knife?—given in fair\r\nfight, mind you, man to man, and the better man wins.” Sagesse held out\r\nhis hand, took a coin, examined it and handed it back.\r\n\r\n“_Bon Dieu_, yes. So you killed him—but where did he get these things\r\nfrom, they are not coins of to-day. Had he, then, been robbing a\r\nmuseum?”\r\n\r\nGaspard nodded with drunken gravity.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, you’ve hit it, he robbed someone of them and wouldn’t\r\nshare, it was over there on the island.”\r\n\r\n“Aha,” said Sagesse. “So you killed him on the island, _vé_, but you\r\nare a man after my own heart, the island—and the name of your man you\r\nsaid was—”\r\n\r\n“Yves.”\r\n\r\nGaspard exhausted, falling into the third stage of intoxication, was\r\nleaning now over the table, his eyelids drooping, the cigar end, no\r\nlonger alight, held loosely in his nerveless fingers.\r\n\r\n“Yves—and what rating was he?”\r\n\r\n“Stoker.”\r\n\r\n“So—but he had another name, he was not only called Yves?”\r\n\r\n“What you say?” asked Gaspard, rousing slightly.\r\n\r\nSagesse repeated his question, but the man at the table did not seem\r\nto comprehend, then, stricken with sleep he sank completely forward,\r\nhis head resting right cheek down on the table, his right hand on\r\nthe pouch containing the money. Sagesse looked at him for a moment\r\ncontemplatively, then he went to the door and cried, “Jules.” A\r\nshuffling sound came along the deck, and a big negro, bare-footed and\r\nbare-breasted, with his wool all tied up in little knots, made his\r\nappearance at the door.\r\n\r\nSagesse pointed to the man at the table, and Jules with a broad grin\r\nbut without a word, entered and took the dreamer by the shoulders,\r\nSagesse took him by the feet, and between them they carried him to the\r\nstarboard dog hole, which did duty for a mate’s cabin when a mate was\r\non board. Here they put him in the bunk, Sagesse placed the belt and\r\npouch of money in the bunk beside him, then they closed the door on him\r\nand left him to his slumbers.\r\n\r\nWhen Sagesse found himself alone, he took a chart from a locker, spread\r\nit on the table and pored over it.\r\n\r\nGaspard had told him that he had only been drifting since morning. If\r\nthis were so, if the man were not lying, and if, indeed, he had left\r\nan island that morning, then the only island he possibly could have\r\nleft was here marked on the chart, a tiny island reef beset to North,\r\nSouth, and East; eighty miles or so southeast of Turks Island.\r\n\r\nSagesse knew the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic that includes the\r\nBahamas as well, almost, as he knew the heart of the lower order of\r\nmankind. He knew from his own knowledge, and leaving the chart aside,\r\nthat there was only one islet about here from which a boat could drift\r\nor be rowed in the course of a day to the point where he had picked\r\nup his new acquaintance. He knew the island by sight, too, the clump\r\nof seven palm trees, the white sandy beach, and the murderous reefs.\r\nHe had seen it through the glass several times, in past years. He had\r\ncounted the palms, seven of them. He never forgot anything; that was\r\npartly why from a foremast hand in the French mercantile marine, he had\r\nrisen to wealth and eminence of a sort. He fetched a pen and inkhorn\r\nfrom the locker, and made just over the islet the form of a tiny cross,\r\nthen he put the chart, pen and ink back in their places and came on\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nThe moon had risen, still a crescent but strong enough to flood the\r\nsea with light. Jules had relieved the man at the wheel, and stood a\r\ndusky ghost before the yellow binnacle light, the wind still held and\r\nhad even strengthened a little, and in the silence of the night the\r\nclick of the rudder chain, the wash of the water at the bow, and the\r\noccasional groan of hemp-rope and block could be heard.\r\n\r\nThe barquentine seemed talking to herself in an undertone. Old\r\nand weary of the sea, dressed in canvas, patched and stained and\r\nill-fitting, barnacled and streaming southern weeds from her copper,\r\nshe went her way across the moonlit water, steering now, to make the\r\npassage between Haiti and Porto Rico; a hag of the ocean groping her\r\nway from port to port, now on honest business, now on contraband, from\r\nYucatan to Port of Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nLA BELLE ARLÉSIENNE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about six o’clock the next morning Gaspard awoke from sleep, half\r\nstifled by the close air of the little cabin where Sagesse had placed\r\nhim. The taste of the rum was still in his mouth, and at a stroke, and\r\nalmost at the return of consciousness, the doings of the past night\r\nrose before him—up to a certain point. He remembered the conversation\r\nof Sagesse, he remembered taking the belt from his waist and flinging\r\nit and the pouch of money on the table, but beyond that point he\r\nremembered nothing.\r\n\r\nHe put his hand to his waist, belt and bag were gone. He put his legs\r\nout of the bunk, and was just in the act of getting on his feet when\r\nhis hand rested on something hard, it was the pouch. It had not been\r\ntampered with, he could tell that by the feel, but, to make sure, he\r\nopened it and counted the gold pieces by the dim light which shone\r\nthrough the scuttle overhead.\r\n\r\nYes, the twenty-one pieces of gold were there, solid, bright and hard.\r\nHe put the belt round his waist and buttoning his coat over the pouch\r\ncame on deck.\r\n\r\n_La Belle Arlésienne_, close hauled under all sail, was making a full\r\neight knots steering S. S. E. with the coast of Haiti a line on the\r\nsouthern horizon. She had altered her course in the night and she\r\nlay now with the shoals and reefs south of Turks Island on her port\r\nquarter, but nothing of them shewed, for the sea over that way under\r\nthe newborn sun lay like a blazing gem, a sheet of corrugated crystal,\r\neach of whose million, million facets was a mirror; then, round from\r\nthere to where the bowsprit was poking at the sky above the sea line\r\nwent the sea, without sail or sign of life deepening in blueness to\r\nwhere the far-off Haitian coast lay hyacinth coloured in the morning.\r\n\r\nGaspard looked around him, he could see no sign of Sagesse; a negro\r\ndressed in a pair of canvas trousers held by a single suspender, stood\r\nat the wheel, several more were grouped round the fo’csle-head engaged\r\non some business, and a thin streak of smoke from the caboose told of\r\nbreakfast in progress.\r\n\r\nFrom where he stood the deck stretched away unencumbered by cargo,\r\nand barred by the shadows of the standing rigging; they had taken the\r\nboat on board, and she was lying bottom up on the deck forward of the\r\nmainmast.\r\n\r\nDespite her age, despite the decks so yellow stained by time that plank\r\nand dowel were of the same colour and indistinguishable, despite the\r\nsails all cut and patched, the old barquentine had still a look of\r\nbuoyancy and life caught from the brave morning light and the flooding\r\nazure of sea and sky.\r\n\r\nThe smell of tar and bilge and rope, the groan of rubber and creak of\r\nmast brought up for Gaspard the vision of the _Tamalpais_ and his early\r\nyouth. No other sensation is at all like the feel of a sailing ship\r\nbeneath one’s feet. The steamer is a dead weight driven by an alien\r\nforce, its progression is a continual insult to the wind and the sea,\r\nbut the sailing ship is one with the sea and the wind, her motion is\r\nfluent, fresh, and part of the eternal movement of nature. As Gaspard\r\nstood with his eyes fixed on the distant Haitian coast, Sagesse came\r\nout of the deck-house and gave him good-morning.\r\n\r\nThe Captain had a telescope in his hand, and ranging himself beside\r\nGaspard he began to examine the coast-line attentively through the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nNot a word did he say of the proceedings of the past night. He stood\r\npicking out the points and headlands of the coast, remarking on them\r\nnow and then, and now and then throwing in some piece of reminiscence,\r\nas “Over there—you can just see that bluish spot, it goes in deep,\r\nthe land there—that’s where a big English ship went on the rocks. The\r\n_Severn_ in the storm of ’82. I helped in the salving. _Ma foi_, I have\r\nnever seen such a big ship with her back so broken. She was opened out\r\nlike a band-box. She was filled with millinery, too. New York fashions\r\nfor Jamaica; the rocks were dressed in chiffon, it was like the wreck\r\nof the _Bon Marché_, and the negresses came down to help—you can\r\nfancy!” or “That point, you can just see it with the eye to eastward\r\nof the blue spot, over there they hanged the last of the pirates,\r\nFreemantle—”\r\n\r\n“What does he know, what did I say last night. I remember flinging the\r\nmoney on the table, I remember saying something about Yves—but what?\r\nDid I say much, did I say little? And the money, he must have picked\r\nit up and put it in the pouch, and put the pouch and belt beside me as\r\nI lay in the bunk, hog that I was—_mordieu_—what did I say?” These\r\nthoughts were running through Gaspard’s mind as he stood watching his\r\ncompanion and listening to his remarks almost without comprehending\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut Sagesse, whatever he knew, shewed nothing of his knowledge. He\r\nchatted familiarly and easily, and when breakfast was brought aft by\r\nJules they sat down to it, and over the steaming coffee and fried bacon\r\nand bananas, the Captain continued his easygoing discourse, chatting\r\non everything and nothing, but always with interest.\r\n\r\nThe blackguardly edge had gone off his conversation, it was only at\r\nnight it appeared whetted by alcohol, for Sagesse was a methodical\r\ndrinker, never glancing at the bottle till the absinthe hour.\r\n\r\nGaspard during the meal made an offer of work, but Sagesse would not\r\nhear of it.\r\n\r\n“You are a brother Provençal, well, I have picked you up floating about\r\non the sea and that’s all about it, I have more than enough hands to\r\nwork the ship, and your food, what does it cost? Besides, we can settle\r\nup at St. Pierre. St. Pierre, Martinique, yes that is my port. You have\r\nnever been there? Ah, _mordieu_, then you have never seen life, you\r\nwill see it at St. Pierre where men know how to laugh, and love is as\r\ncheap as bananas.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will be able to pay you,” said Gaspard, “that is to say if I\r\never can pay you for all you have done for me.”\r\n\r\nSagesse laughed.\r\n\r\nHis face, ordinarily pleasant except for a certain fixity of the eyes,\r\nlost its pleasantness in some strange way when he laughed.\r\n\r\nClean shaved, except for a rather heavy and drooping moustache, fat and\r\nweather-tanned, in white cap and apron, save for his bronzing he would\r\nhave made an ideal chef; a concocter of sauces and _entremets_, fat\r\nwith the steam of his kitchen; but when he laughed he shewed his teeth\r\nand just that one touch destroyed his _bonhommie_, for his laughter did\r\nnot extend above his mouth, and laughter is inhuman when the eyes do\r\nnot correct the teeth.\r\n\r\nAll day they kept the Haitian coast on the distant horizon, the water\r\nhad been blue off the island, but to Gaspard, as he hung over the side,\r\nit seemed that this water was even bluer. It was; the Caribbean, that\r\ngreat lake of burning indigo, was sending its colour to meet them, the\r\nfoam flakes from the fore-foot of the _Belle Arlésienne_ swept past\r\nlike marble shavings cast on slabs of lapis-lazuli, and violets would\r\nhave seemed pale and faded held against the background of the sea to\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE MONEY-CHANGER\r\n\r\n\r\nGaspard, though a man full-grown and a man, moreover, who had passed\r\nhis life in touch with the brutal side of things, had still in his\r\nnature very much of the child. The Provençal rarely grows old, he\r\nwithers at last in the sun and comes to die, but the child in him\r\nremains a child; imaginative, impulsive, easily moved to laughter or\r\ntears, good or naughty, with a passion for colour, and movement, and\r\nsound, and exaggeration. And so he remains a poet in his way.\r\n\r\nGo all over the earth, and you will find man imitating the insect\r\nin this particular, that he is the colour of the leaf he was born\r\non. Gaspard was the colour of Provence, and all the coal-dust of the\r\nstokehold, the sordidness of the life had not altered his essential\r\ncolour; the something tragic, something gay, something vivacious,\r\nsomething lazy which is part of the southern land of black shadows,\r\nwhite roads, blue skies, keen mistral, and poignantly scented flowers\r\nstill clung to his personality.\r\n\r\nEven Sagesse shewed something of a trace of this in the exaggeration of\r\nhis own doings, in his vivacity, and in the flower which he carried in\r\nhis button-hole when ashore.\r\n\r\nBut there was little of the child about Sagesse and much of the master.\r\nAs day followed day, and the working of the vessel shewed itself more\r\nand more to Gaspard, astonishment filled him at the extraordinary\r\ndiscipline amidst the hands, and the way Sagesse worked them. When\r\nhe was out of sight they would shout and chatter amongst themselves,\r\nbut the instant he appeared silence took the deck as it takes a grove\r\nof chattering birds when a hawk appears in the sky overhead. Orders\r\nwere executed at a run, yet he never swore or raised his voice louder\r\nthan was necessary; occasionally when a man got in the way, as on the\r\nnight of Gaspard’s boarding the vessel, he would give him a kick just\r\nas a master might kick a dog, but beyond that his rule seemed kindly.\r\nThey were all Barbadians, these blacks, and English-speaking, with the\r\nexception of Jules who was Haitian born, but Sagesse could talk to them\r\nfluently in their own language. He could talk four languages, French,\r\nSpanish, English, and Portuguese; he had picked the three foreign\r\nlanguages up as a means to trade, and it was to his mastery of them, as\r\nmuch as his own astuteness, that he owed his success in life.\r\n\r\nOne night, sultry and cloudless with the sea like frosted silver under\r\nthe starlight and the warm breathing of the wind, Gaspard, going into\r\nthe deck-house found Sagesse seated at the table before a chart.\r\n\r\n“If this wind holds,” said Sagesse, “we should sight Martinique at\r\ndawn.” He spoke with his eyes upon the chart, then, looking up: “What\r\ndo you propose to do when you get there?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as for me I don’t know,” said Gaspard taking a seat opposite the\r\nother. “Report myself to the _Compagnie Transatlantique_—draw what pay\r\nis owing to me, and try and get recompense for my kit.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Sagesse, “if I were in your place, I would let all that\r\nslip.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, how?—say nothing, or as little as you can, report yourself,\r\nbut do not trouble about compensation.”\r\n\r\n“And why?”\r\n\r\nSagesse laughed, “Because my friend, it is not well to stir muddy\r\nwater; you get before one of these infernal clerks with a pen in his\r\nhand, and he takes notes of what you say, you ask for compensation and\r\nhe says, ‘Yes, yes, that is just, compensation, certainly, but first\r\nmy friend, prove yourself to be whom you say you are, and give us your\r\nstory in detail.’ Then with the point of his pen he turns you inside\r\nout and,” said Sagesse tapping on the table with his thumb, “it is not\r\nwell to be turned inside out if one has anything to conceal.”\r\n\r\n“To conceal?”\r\n\r\n“For instance,” went on Sagesse, “the official of the _Compagnie\r\nTransatlantique_ might say, ‘Who was your engineer-in-chief, who was\r\nyour second engineer, had you a chum, what was his name?’”. Sagesse\r\nwatching Gaspard narrowly saw the sweat start on his forehead, laughed,\r\nand finished, “and you would not say, ‘His name is Yves, he escaped\r\nwith me, we landed on an island, he had a belt about his waist and a\r\npouch containing a number of valuable gold coins which he had stolen,\r\nand I killed him and took the money.’ You would not say that, perhaps,\r\nwith your tongue, but your face might give a hint, or your manner, and\r\na hint might lead to a suspicion, and a suspicion to a search—_you\r\nshould have burned that body_.”\r\n\r\nGaspard, staring at the man before him, felt as though an ice-cold\r\nblade had been driven through his heart, his flesh crawled. He had\r\ntold all, then, to this man, and more than all. He felt nothing of\r\nwhat the criminal feels whose crime has been discovered, for he felt\r\nhimself innocent of crime or criminal intent. It was the horror of the\r\nfact that he had given himself away, and under the influence of drink\r\nhad described the affair in such a manner that Sagesse believed him a\r\nmurderer—this it was that paralysed him for the moment.\r\n\r\nFor a moment only, then, thrusting his hands out as though he were\r\nputting something away from him, he burst out, “I did not kill him for\r\nmoney—it’s a lie. If I said so I lied—it was an accident. True, we\r\nquarrelled about the money, but I did not kill him for it. The knife\r\nonly scratched him and he dropped. I had saved his life; does a man\r\nmurder another whose life he has saved? When I spoke, I was mad with\r\nyour cursed drink. If I had murdered him would I have told of it? I did\r\nnot kill him for money—do you believe me?”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” replied Sagesse quite unmoved, “I believe you. But you\r\nyourself admit the fact that you killed him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, by accident.”\r\n\r\n“And took his money?”\r\n\r\n“It did not belong to him. He had only just found it amidst the bushes,\r\nthe belt and the pouch. Why do you shake your head, do you not believe\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Whether I believe you or not, does it matter—? This man had found\r\nmoney, you killed him—by accident, with a knife, and took his money.\r\nDoes your reason not tell you that such a tale is enough to hang the\r\nArchbishop of Paris—but it is all your affair, and as I said just\r\nnow, my advice is to let the thing lie. Do not disturb dead bones. Let\r\nus forget it, and be practical. If I chose, I could hand you over to\r\nthe authorities at Martinique to-morrow. I have marked on the chart\r\nthe position where you boarded me, and the position of that island,\r\nwhich is the only one in that vicinity. But it would not be of the\r\nleast profit to me to get you into trouble. Not in the least. I would\r\nmuch sooner help you. Well, to business. That money will be your worst\r\nfriend, instead of your best if you try to use it ashore as it is, you\r\nmust change it for good American dollars. Put it on the table and I\r\nwill change it for you.”\r\n\r\n“Before God,” burst out Gaspard, “I will do nothing unless you believe\r\nme when I say that I came by it rightly, that there is no stain of\r\nblood on it, that what happened there on the island was an accident,\r\nand that I am no murderer!”\r\n\r\nSagesse, who knew man thoroughly, and who ever since the first morning\r\nof their acquaintance had been studying him minutely, rose to his feet\r\nand slapped his right hand down on the table palm uppermost.\r\n\r\n“I believe you, there, the words are said and let us say no more on the\r\nmatter—how far others would believe you, it is not for me to say, but\r\nthere, let the matter end and come to business.”\r\n\r\nHe sat down again, and Gaspard opening the pouch at his waist put the\r\ncoins on the table in a heap.\r\n\r\nSagesse counted them. “_Dieu_,” said he, holding one in his hand and\r\nexamining it. “Fancy trying to change this lot at a banker’s or _bureau\r\nde change_, they would be enough to raise a blister on the reputation\r\nof a saint. I can get rid of them, though; with difficulty it is true,\r\nbut still I can get rid of them. But I don’t take risks without a\r\nchance of good profits. I will give you forty dollars for the lot.”\r\n\r\n“Less than two dollars apiece?”\r\n\r\n“Slightly.”\r\n\r\n“_Mordieu_,” said Gaspard. “I would as soon throw them overboard.”\r\n\r\nSagesse put both his elbows on the table and laughed. Then the haggling\r\nbegan. Gaspard, the son of a tradesman, had something of the business\r\nman in his nature. It was a strange picture, and not without its\r\nromantic side. The two southerners seated opposite to each other at\r\nthe table of the dingy deck-house, the swinging lamp overhead casting\r\nits light on the chart, the pieces of gold, and the strenuous faces of\r\nthe barterers.\r\n\r\nOne might imagine that Sagesse, having the game, seemingly, in his\r\nhands, would have forced his terms on the other; but that would be\r\nwithout counting on the character of the Captain and the laws which\r\ngoverned his life. “Never appeal to social laws unless in the last\r\nextremity. Never use force against a man stronger than yourself. Take\r\nthe pyx, but leave the priest the chalice (in other words—do not strip\r\na man so bare that he will turn upon you in desperation)”—these were\r\nthree of the laws governing this wise man’s actions. He was an artist\r\nin scoundrelism, for he knew the value of restraint.\r\n\r\n“Sixty dollars, then,” said Sagesse, after they had been haggling for\r\nhalf an hour or more. “You agree, good, of course I will make my profit\r\non them, but what would you have? I am a trader, _vé_—, and I will\r\ngive you more than sixty dollars; I will give you advice.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t go back to the stokehold. With sixty dollars in Martinique you\r\nmay start a little business. Go shares in a fishing boat, deal in\r\nfruit—you are young and active, and in Martinique sixty dollars are\r\nequal to six hundred at Havre or in Paris. I will shew you the ropes,\r\nas the English say. Do you know, monsieur, that I, Pierre Sagesse, have\r\nstarted by my advice and help a dozen people in Martinique who are now\r\nprospering?”\r\n\r\nHe had risen, and all the time he was talking he was searching in the\r\nlocker where he kept his charts. At last he drew forth a little chamois\r\nbag and, opening it, shot out on the table the money it contained. The\r\nlittle bag held exactly sixty dollars in gold coin and some silver.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, the exact sum; that is odd and ought to be a sign of luck.\r\nThere is your money, and I will not take the belt and pouch; you can\r\nkeep them.”\r\n\r\nGaspard pocketed the money. It was more than odd that the little\r\nchamois leather bag held the exact sum in question. He felt certain\r\nthat Sagesse, days before, had worked out the problem of what he should\r\npay for the coins, and had placed this sum in readiness.\r\n\r\nThe character of the man lay revealed in that act, as also in the way\r\nhe had kept dumb about Yves till the moment of his purpose.\r\n\r\nGaspard felt certain that had it suited his interests Sagesse would\r\nhave betrayed him to the authorities. He left the deck-house, and\r\nleaning against the starboard bulwarks, looked over the starlit sea.\r\n\r\nThough he had left the island blue leagues behind, it still pursued\r\nhim, and, in the form of Sagesse, still had a hold upon him, the island\r\nand the deed committed there.\r\n\r\nHe could see it still, just as he saw it when making his escape. The\r\nsun-stricken palms, the white beach, the white surf breaking on the\r\nbeach, the white gulls—he could hear their voices calling to him.\r\n\r\n“Hi, Hi, Hi! You there in the boat! come back! come back! Hi! think you\r\nto escape us? Ha! Ha! Hi! Fishing, wheeling! calling! O the weariness,\r\nthe blueness, the waves, the wind, the sun. They are ours and they are\r\nyours forever—forever—forever. Hi!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE MAGIC TOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was awakened next morning by the roar of the anchor-chain through\r\nthe hawse-pipe.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later he was on deck.\r\n\r\n_La Belle Arlésienne_, steered by magic hands during the night, had\r\nraised some magic horizon and passed it to anchor in paradise. So it\r\nseemed to him as his eyes travelled from the cloud turban of Mont Pelée\r\ncoloured by the dawn, and followed the tumbling woods, the cascades of\r\nleaping foliage high, far off, dark in shadow, falling to the hillside\r\ncity; and the city breaking from the woods, falling street by street\r\nto the harbour’s edge; palm-tops peeping above the red-tiled roofs;\r\nhouses, shadows, palms; tracery of gardens, squares, step flights\r\nfrom street to street; old moss-grown flights of steps, old gardens\r\nand scraps of gardens giving shelter to the grenadilla and the fleur\r\nd’amour; old houses, heavy-built and lightly coloured, all stretching\r\nfrom the great high woods to the very edge of the shadowy harbour in\r\nwhose depths the blue of night still lay.\r\n\r\nThe blue of night—though the sky above Pelée was ablaze with the\r\nmorning blue. Over on the east of the island at Grande Anse the morning\r\nwas already full and splendid, but here the shadow of peak and morn\r\nheld everything in magical _chiara oscuro_. The city, seen as though\r\nthrough a vague veil of gauze, seemed asleep, yet it was burning\r\nwith early morning life, and Gaspard, as he watched, could see the\r\nmoving figures of people, forms trickling down the steep flights of\r\nsteps leading from street to street, and swarming by the sea-steps and\r\nharbour side.\r\n\r\nHeld, just for a moment, in this curious twilight lingering in the\r\nshadow of Pelée, whilst all the sea world beyond flashed to the\r\nsun-blaze of the tropics, the old sea-city of St. Pierre hanging,\r\nliterally, between sky and sea, between dawn and night, between the\r\npresent and the past, shewed to the mind those pictures of suggestion\r\nwhich lie in tapestry and verse.\r\n\r\nGaspard had never seen anything at all like this. He had seen many a\r\ntropic town where the galvanized tin roof of the trader, or the rigid\r\noutlines of the Methodist meeting house broke crudely through the\r\nbeauty of palmiste and orange. But St. Pierre lay before him beautiful,\r\nabsolutely beautiful, like a dream city set in Wonderland.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more wonderful than those torrential woods far up\r\nabove the houses, woods of balisier and palm, tamarind, ceiba, and\r\ngiant fern; lianas cable thick, air shoots, all climbing in the\r\ntwilight, and leading the eyes to the slopes of Pelée and the peak,\r\ncloud-wreathed and burning in the blue.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more strange or more poetical than the city reaching\r\nfrom these woods to the shadowy sea.\r\n\r\nOther vessels were anchored in the harbour, boats were putting out from\r\nthe shore; now, clear and sharp-cut, through the vague noises of early\r\nmorning came the note of a bugle from the fort, and from a sailing-ship\r\naway to starboard the clank of capstan pawls and the cry of sailors\r\nhauling on the halyards.\r\n\r\nWith and through everything came the perfume of the land, earth and\r\ntropic flowers, jasmine and vanilla scents, mixed with the scent of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nGaspard turned from the city and looked westward. Beyond the shadow\r\nof the island the sea lay in the bright daylight, shewing beneath the\r\nemerald ring of the horizon the virginal blue of early morning.\r\n\r\nAs he turned, Sagesse left the deck-house and stood for a moment\r\nlooking on the land before speaking to his companion.\r\n\r\n“Better than the stokehold,” said the Captain, who had put on a clean\r\nsuit of white drill, and a shore-going and holiday manner; “better than\r\nthe engine-room, _vé_! Look, the _canotiers_ are putting off and the\r\nport officers will be aboard us before we have finished breakfast.”\r\n\r\nJules appeared, as he spoke, from the caboose, bearing a steaming\r\ncoffee-pot; they went into the deck-house for the meal, and before\r\nit was half through and, as if to bear out the truth of Sagesse’s\r\nprediction, the port officers arrived.\r\n\r\nThey came into the deck-house, where Sagesse served them with vermouth\r\nand cigarettes; they seemed to know Sagesse as a friend, and bill of\r\nlading or bill of health seemed to trouble them very little as far as\r\nGaspard could judge, who, in the middle of the cigarette smoking and\r\nexchange of news, left Sagesse to his friends and came on deck.\r\n\r\nHe found a new St. Pierre. Colour had stolen over the slopes of Pelée;\r\nlight had stretched out her hand and torn away the veil of twilight. A\r\nburst of blue struck him in the face as he left the dingy deck-house. A\r\nsky of blue, a sea of blue, triumphant, crystalline, dazzling, and in\r\nthe midst of this world of leaping lazulite, St. Pierre standing like a\r\ndreamer awakened by the sea.\r\n\r\nAwakened from where the high woods were rocking and singing in the\r\nmorning wind, to where the breeze-swept harbour was lipping ship side\r\nand quay with the flash of sapphire satin.\r\n\r\nOne could see, so clear was the air, the tiles on the red-tiled roofs\r\nand the palm fronds bursting above them; a flag was flickering above\r\nsome consulate, the palm-tops were dancing to the breeze that bore on\r\nits hot breath the scent of earth and trees and the sounds of the city\r\nthat seemed less a city than a daring aquarelle, blindingly beautiful,\r\ntriumphantly bright.\r\n\r\nRound the _Belle Arlésienne_ _canotiers_ were paddling; banana-coloured\r\nchildren in little coffin-shaped canoes made out of old packing-cases,\r\ncanned meat cases, anything in the form of a box that could be cut into\r\nthe form of a canoe. They were chattering to the black sailors, and\r\nwhen they saw Gaspard they shouted to him to fling them coins to dive\r\nfor, but before he could put his hand in his pocket Sagesse and the\r\nport officers left the deck-house.\r\n\r\nThe newcomers had offered to row Sagesse and Gaspard ashore, and the\r\ncaptain had evidently told them of the fate of the _Rhone_, for, as\r\nthey crossed the harbour, Gaspard found himself an object of interest\r\nand plied with a hundred questions. At the sight of Sagesse the little\r\n_canotiers_ had dispersed in every direction, and now, as they rowed,\r\nGaspard could hear the thin voices of the children chanting a song;\r\nhe caught the word “Sagesse” repeated over and over again, but the\r\nlisping _patois_ and the breeze dimmed all else but the spirit of the\r\nballad—Derision. Sagesse was not, evidently, a favorite with the\r\n_canotiers_ of St. Pierre, yet, to look at him seated by the port\r\ndoctor, a cigar in his mouth and his thumbs stuck in his waist-belt,\r\none might have fancied him a man to whom children would run by instinct.\r\n\r\nHe was in grand good humour this morning; so was Gaspard; so, too,\r\nseemed the port officers. The joyous city seemed to radiate gaiety;\r\nthe languor of midday had not yet fallen upon it and it laughed like a\r\nchild awakened by a kiss on a bright morning.\r\n\r\nThe harbour-side was crowded; naked children, half-naked men, black\r\nmen, banana-coloured men, apricot-coloured men, chattering in that\r\nFrench worn smooth which is the language of the French West Indies, a\r\nlanguage in which _Monsieur_ becomes _Missie_, _Maman_, _Manmam_, and\r\n_France_, _Fouance_.\r\n\r\nAmidst the ‘longshoremen, the idlers, the _canotiers_, fishermen, and\r\nboatmen, strayed the forms of a few women, bright as tropic birds,\r\ngraceful in striped foulards and jupes of exquisite colours, their\r\nwasp-yellow turbans striking the eye forcibly, the brightest points in\r\na picture surcharged with colour and blinding light.\r\n\r\nSinbad never landed at a stranger port than this, so vividly real, so\r\nfar removed from the commonplace, so filled with the presence of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nRomance sat on the very sea-steps, and as Gaspard landed he felt what\r\nevery man who ever landed at St. Pierre must have felt vividly or\r\nvaguely—her touch.\r\n\r\nSagesse, bidding good-day to the port officers, struck uptown\r\naccompanied by Gaspard. Uptown, by flights of old steps, worn,\r\nmoss-grown, shadowed by the black shadows of houses and roofed with a\r\nribbon of blinding azure sky, everywhere the sound of running water\r\nfrom the thousand conduits and fountains, everywhere the sound of the\r\nsea echoing as in the whorl of a great shell.\r\n\r\nThe stepways led to streets, lines of blazing light and colour,\r\nverandahed, broken by black house shadows, filled with coloured people\r\nof all shades, all hues, from the muletresse to the chabine; all busy,\r\nmoving, drifting, chattering, buying or selling, finely formed,\r\ngraceful as the palmistes.\r\n\r\nThen more steps haunted by fountain and sea sounds, and they entered a\r\nriver of light—the Rue Victor Hugo.\r\n\r\nGaspard, as he reached the street, looked back down the steep and\r\ntwilight vico they had ascended, and saw the harbour, liquid shadow on\r\nwhich, seeming suspended in air, floated _La Belle Arlésienne_.\r\n\r\nIt was like a picture closing the first chapter of his life; the sea,\r\nand the island, and the ever-crying gulls, dead Yves, the stokehold,\r\nMarseilles, all lay there. Here was a new land and the beginning of a\r\nnew existence. The sea, the island, the man he had slain—all beyond\r\nthere. It all seemed remote, done with forever; yet it was close to\r\nhim, potently alive in the form of Captain Sagesse, and able to stretch\r\nout a hand and touch him on the shoulder if so it chose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nRUE VICTOR HUGO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite umbrellas, striped verandahs, black shadows, laughter, motion,\r\ncolour, coloured people, coloured clothes, lemon-tinted houses,\r\nflower-blue sky, a street of light beneath a roof of azure, the Rue\r\nVictor Hugo lay before Gaspard.\r\n\r\nLooking straight before one, the scene recalled Naples, Marseilles,\r\nAlexandria, with an extra touch as though a gleam, a perfume, a voice,\r\nhad stolen from some vanished coloured city of the remote past; as\r\nthough Pompeii had sent an idler, Carthage a trader, Tunis a coloured\r\nchild, to lose themselves in the crowd and lend it, scarcely seen, a\r\nheart-catching subtlety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is no sound of feet; everyone is shoeless; they walk in a whisper\r\nunder the wonderful blue light of the sky, these people, these men and\r\nwomen of all shades of yellow, graceful, dignified, gracious, who might\r\nseem the inhabitants of a dream city but for the sounds of everyday\r\nlife, cries of cigar vendors, and pastry vendors, and fruit sellers,\r\nchildren’s voices, laughter; now comes from far away the music of a\r\nmirliton; it is playing in a street below—Pouf! up a steep side street\r\ncomes the sound, louder, and carried on a breath of hot sea wind, and\r\nthere below the blue face of the harbour laughs up at you so high above\r\nit. You pass on; the shops surround you again, and the crowd and the\r\nvoices; you reach a little square, a cube of colour; in its centre like\r\na diamond flower forever in motion, the jet of a fountain plays in\r\nthe sun, plays and sings to itself like the spirit of a happy child;\r\nand here where human voices are less loud you hear the sound of other\r\nfountains, the sound of rivulets, runnels racing by the side walks,\r\npipes that empty into moss-grown channels all drawing their water from\r\nMont Pelée, fatherly, and seated far above the great torrential woods,\r\nsky-throned, and turbaned with cloud.\r\n\r\nYou go on; the endless street bends and dips and rises again, never\r\nquite level; houses and blue bursts of sea alternating on the right,\r\non the left, high above you, houses that break with their sun-stricken\r\nyellow the green foliage of the high woods. The torrent of yellow\r\nhouses up above seems tumbling to the sea, or, if you like it better,\r\nthe houses seem climbing to attack the woods. You can hear from up\r\nthere wood sounds, the piping of the _siffleur de montagne_, the wash\r\nof moving foliage, just as you can hear from below the sounds of the\r\nsea, the songs of the fishermen, and the wash of the water on the beach.\r\n\r\nAs a curious and beautiful poem leads you to read on, so the coloured\r\nand sunlit street leads you to follow it; it brings you by a bridge\r\nacross the Rivière Roxelane, where the washerwomen work from dawn\r\ntill dark, and the boulders are snowed with linen, and so to the\r\nmarket-place, where the strangest things from sea and land are sold.\r\n\r\nBeyond lie the mornes, green to the water’s edge; the sea, the sky;\r\ngreat blue wastes of sun and silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom a flower-seller as they entered the Rue Victor Hugo, Sagesse had\r\nbought a gaudy blossom which he put in his coat.\r\n\r\nHe was _en fête_ and his good humour was infectious; linking his arm\r\nin that of Gaspard, he had led him into a café, a cool, spacious shop\r\nset out with marble-topped tables. On every table there was a little\r\nbowl filled with bright-coloured blossoms; men were seated about, men\r\nin cool white clothes and broad panama hats. As Gaspard followed his\r\ncompanion between the tables he noticed that all these men gave Sagesse\r\ngood-day as though he were an old acquaintance, but without enthusiasm,\r\nand with a certain constraint.\r\n\r\nThen, choosing a table in a corner, they sat down, and Sagesse beckoned\r\nto the bartender. He came running.\r\n\r\nHe had been piling some glasses on a tray and had not caught sight of\r\nthe newcomers until just before Sagesse beckoned to him; instantly,\r\nand almost upsetting the tray in his haste, he came, and now he stood,\r\na middle-aged quadroon, mild-eyed, subdued-looking, standing before\r\nSagesse as a slave might stand before his master.\r\n\r\n“_Bonjour_, Jules.”\r\n\r\n“_Bonjour_, missie.”\r\n\r\n“How has trade been since I left?”\r\n\r\n“Good, missie—Jules has been busy, very busy, for most a month—before\r\nthat not so good.” He spoke in the Creole _patois_, soft, fluent, a\r\nlanguage that seems made for the lips of children.\r\n\r\nSagesse ordered drinks. When they were on the table he lit a cigar,\r\nhanded Gaspard another, and then, crossing his legs and suddenly\r\nchanging his manner:\r\n\r\n“Let us talk business,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Business?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, yes; that’s what they call it—business. See here. I want\r\nthe true story of the gold in that belt. I want to know more about that\r\nisland, and I want to know something about that treasure-ship.”\r\n\r\nWhen you encounter a tropical centipede the thing that astonishes\r\nyou most is the way in which it changes form, now effacing itself\r\naltogether in some coign of shadow, now drawn out, swollen, vicious,\r\nand ready to attack you, now shrunken, drawn together, a mere nothing\r\nthat, next moment to a touch becomes distended and viciously alive.\r\n\r\nThe mind of Captain Sagesse seemed to possess this centipede attribute.\r\n\r\nGaspard had imagined the affair of the island done with; he had\r\nimagined that with the conclusion of the bargain over the gold pieces\r\nSagesse had passed the matter behind him. He had said nothing about a\r\ntreasure-ship. The ship of coral in the lagoon had been always present\r\nin his mind as a ship that might contain treasure, but he had said\r\nnothing about it. How, then, had Sagesse read his thoughts, and why had\r\nhe not spoken of it before?\r\n\r\nHe stared at the Captain for a moment without speaking. “But that’s all\r\ndone with,” said he at last. “I’ve told you my story; you’ve had your\r\nshare in the stuff—Don’t you believe me? And see here, what do you\r\nmean about a treasure ship? I never said a word about such a thing.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Sagesse, “between the captain and the mate’s cabin\r\non my vessel there is only a plank, and when the man sleeping in the\r\nmate’s cabin shouts out in his sleep ‘Hullo there, Yves, look, I can\r\nsee through her hatch; she’s full of gold; we’ll fetch it out—share\r\nand share alike,’ the captain sets himself to think. He says to\r\nhimself, ‘this man talks of a ship full of gold in his sleep; he came\r\non board my ship from an island over there; he had in his possession a\r\nnumber of old coins, old Spanish pieces; he confesses in drink that he\r\nhas killed Monsieur Yves, the gentleman to whom in his dreams he talks\r\nof a ship full of treasure; well, don’t you see?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“The conclusion—come, confess, you have a secret; give me the full\r\nstory of that affair, or by my soul and on my honour I will call the\r\nauthorities right in here and tell them a lot of things I know.”\r\n\r\nSagesse, as he said the last words, changed completely, and in a\r\nmoment, the _bon bourgeois_ vanished, his upper lip raised slightly,\r\ndisclosing the teeth. Just in that moment he shewed himself what he\r\nwas, not a villain of romance, but that much more terrible individual,\r\nthe petty trader, heartless, careful, calculating. The squid of society\r\nthat, living on crabs and shell-fish, will, when opportunity offers,\r\nseize and devour a man.\r\n\r\nWhat numbed the mind of Gaspard was not fear of the authorities, but\r\nfear of Sagesse and astonishment at his methods.\r\n\r\nHe felt as though in the grip of some gelatinous thing, this dusky\r\nmind had gripped him on board the _Belle Arlésienne_ and had seemed to\r\nlet him go; its tentacles had fallen from his arms, and now they were\r\naround his feet. It was useless to fight with Sagesse; he was at the\r\nman’s mercy; betrayed by drink, he had put himself in the grasp of the\r\ncuttlefish.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said he at last, “before I tell you anything, tell me\r\nthis: Why did you not spring this on me before? Why did you trade with\r\nme for those coins? Why did you pretend to be my friend?”\r\n\r\n“Why did I trade with you, _ma foi_? I traded with you because I wanted\r\nthose coins at a fair price; I brought you here because I wanted to\r\ntrade with you for your secret at a fair price with the law at my\r\nelbow. I did not wish to conclude the bargain on board my own ship; it\r\ngives a ship a bad name when men are brought off her in chains by the\r\npolice. I wanted no police on board _La Belle Arlésienne_. And as to\r\npretending to be your friend, _ma foi_, I am your friend, and you shall\r\nhave your share of the profits of your secret. But the truth I must\r\nhave, come—”\r\n\r\n“_Dieu!_” cried Gaspard with a burst of irritation. “I was hiding\r\nnothing from you. There _was_ a wreck on the island; I _did_ think\r\nthere was treasure on her, but I had put it from my mind. I talked of\r\nit in my sleep, did I? Well, it must have been there in my mind. You\r\nshall have the story.”\r\n\r\nThen, with his elbows on the table, he told how Yves had discovered the\r\nship in the lagoon; he described her. Sagesse, also with his elbows on\r\nthe table, listening intently, putting in a question now and then.\r\n\r\n“That’s all,” finished Gaspard, “she may be up to the hatches with gold\r\nfor all I know—and for the matter of that—for all I care.”\r\n\r\nSagesse sat, now that the tale was told, musing in his chair, and\r\npulling at his heavy moustache.\r\n\r\n“And you were on that island,” said he at last, “you saw that wreck,\r\nyou found gold and the dead bones of a man, you fancied there might be\r\nmore stuff there, yet, if I had not got the tale from you you would\r\nhave said nothing to anyone about it; you would have perhaps gone back\r\nto the stokehold. Pah! I believe you, for that’s the kind of thing that\r\nfills stokeholds with fools who are good for nothing but stoking—well,\r\nyou will be fortunate despite yourself. I take the speculation up.”\r\n\r\n“You intend—”\r\n\r\n“I intend to dynamite her open and see what she contains. When _La\r\nBelle Arlésienne_ has discharged her cargo, I will put her in ballast,\r\ntake some diving apparatus and what else is needful, and return to that\r\nisland; you will go with me.”\r\n\r\n“I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you; do you think I want the whole of St. Pierre in the business?\r\nI will take only my coloured crew; several of them are good divers, but\r\nI must have another white man on a job like this. You will have your\r\nshare of the profits, fifteen per cent. That may be much, or it may be\r\nnothing, but you will have to work for it, for it will be horse work\r\ngetting the stuff off her if she lies as you tell me. I take it she has\r\nbeen lying in that lagoon all of a hundred years; if she is a Spaniard\r\nthere may be a lot of stuff—” Then, after a moment’s pause, “There is\r\nstuff on that island; I smell it.”\r\n\r\nHe fell into a moment’s reverie, then, as if talking to himself, “the\r\nfellow those bones belonged to had something to do with her; he was one\r\nof her crew, or he was there hunting for treasure. He may have died of\r\nstarvation or accident, or he may have discovered the stuff and been\r\nkilled by his companions; if that was so they would not have left that\r\nbelt and money behind them.”\r\n\r\nGaspard sat watching Sagesse; the man’s mind seemed ferreting about the\r\nbusiness like a hound; he seemed actually to smell money in the thing.\r\nPerhaps he did. There are men who in some uncanny way have the power of\r\nscenting fortune; their speculations rarely fail; they know what will\r\nappreciate in value, whether in land or stocks, and they will throw up\r\nthe most likely venture just because their genius has discovered in it\r\nsome hidden and fatal flaw unperceived by other men.\r\n\r\nAs Gaspard sat watching Sagesse a faint glow of enthusiasm began to\r\nwarm his breast. What man is there to whom the thought of hidden\r\ntreasure does not appeal? The idea of returning to the island would\r\nhave been hateful to him half an hour a go, but already his heart was\r\nstirring to the venture.\r\n\r\nHe would not be alone.\r\n\r\nAlready he had divined the main points of Sagesse’s character—or\r\nfancied he had—. He felt him to be cold-blooded, heartless,\r\ncalculating, yet he fancied that if Sagesse offered him fifteen francs\r\nout of every hundred he made on the business he would keep his word.\r\nWith such a small percentage in view it would be easier to keep his\r\nword than break it and make trouble. Sagesse came out of his reverie.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, relighting his cigar, which had gone out, “there’s\r\nan end of the matter. I take the thing up; I put my money in it; I\r\noffer you your fifteen per cent.; I put you in the way, perhaps, of a\r\nsmall fortune. I make you, in fact, a small partner in what may be a\r\nbig concern. Half an hour ago you were a Moco, and your end was the\r\ndrinking bar and the stokehold; you had stuff in your head that was\r\nvaluable to me and I had to blast it out of your skull by threats\r\nof the law, just as I will blast the stuff out of that hooker with\r\ndynamite. Well, what do you think of Pierre Sagesse? Is he a man who\r\nknows his way about? Is he a man worth following? I’m frank as day\r\nwhen I choose to be frank, and I tell you now, you may take the offer\r\nor leave it; come with me, well and good; refuse it, and I will get\r\nanother man. Only, remember this, if you refuse you get nothing.”\r\n\r\n“What you offer is perhaps fair enough,” said Gaspard, “but this I\r\nwill say, straight out, you treated me as a friend this morning; you\r\ntook my arm, you brought me in here, you stood for drinks, and then you\r\nthreatened me with that affair. I don’t like that, and be you who you\r\nmay, I say so.”\r\n\r\nSagesse took a puff at his cigar and then patiently, as though\r\nexplaining things to a child:\r\n\r\n“You, this morning, were going about like a man with a jewel in his\r\nempty skull; I operated like a surgeon, and took it out; it was\r\nunpleasant, but there is the jewel, and instead of charging you a fee I\r\noffer you a percentage on the value. If I had not threatened, you would\r\nnot have told. Well? What do you say?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t say I won’t come—on one condition—that you never name that\r\naffair again or threaten me with it.”\r\n\r\nSagesse laughed. “Threaten you, why should I? I have used the\r\ninstrument, I fling it away. I have got all I want out of you, and now\r\nit is your turn to profit a bit. You will be very useful, and I don’t\r\nwant a stranger in the business.”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said Gaspard, true Provençal that he was, “fifteen per\r\ncent.—make it twenty—”\r\n\r\n“Not a cent more than fifteen, not a cent, not a centime. I never go\r\nback on an offer of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“When do you start?”\r\n\r\n“It will take me a week to clear the cargo and get ready; meanwhile you\r\nhave your pocket full of dollars, and you can amuse yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I will come.”\r\n\r\n“Your word on that.”\r\n\r\n“I give you my word.”\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps have divined that in the character of Gaspard, a\r\ncharacter primitive enough, childlike in some ways, and swayed by\r\nelemental passions, there lay a streak of straightness. To this man,\r\nwho would not have known the meaning of “ethics,” straight-dealing came\r\nas a natural gift. Sagesse had divined this fact and valued it, for,\r\nspeaking generally, there is no man in the world who values honour in\r\nanother more than your rogue.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said the Captain, rising from his seat. “I have business to\r\ndo, and so have you. The _Compagnie Transatlantique_ office is close\r\nhere; go and report yourself; the port authorities will have you up\r\nbefore them too; you will most likely find their man at the shipping\r\noffice, for I said you would be there, and, see here, you will want a\r\nsuit or two of white drill; those clothes you have are too heavy for\r\nMartinique. Then you’ll want a room; there are sailors’ boarding-houses\r\nby the harbour, steer clear of them.”\r\n\r\nHe took a little notebook from his pocket and wrote a name and address\r\non a sheet of paper, tore it out and handed it to his companion.\r\n\r\n“Go there. Manman Faly, Rue du Morne, No. 3. She’ll put you up and find\r\nyou a place. It’s off the Grande Rue. You’ll easily find it; come.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to leave.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t paid for the drinks,” said Gaspard, putting his hand in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nSagesse laughed. “I never pay here; the place is mine; Jules there\r\nmanages it for me; he’s one of my people.”\r\n\r\nGaspard was soon to learn how many unfortunates in St. Pierre came\r\nunder that designation, “One of my people.”\r\n\r\nThey passed out into the blinding street, under the flower-blue sky.\r\nOnly twenty yards or so down lay the shop where clothes could be\r\nbought. Here Gaspard for twenty-two francs bought two suits of white\r\ndrill, a pair of white canvas shoes, and an imitation panama. He put on\r\none of the suits, and ordering the other to be sent to the address in\r\nthe Rue du Morne, walked out again feeling a new man.\r\n\r\nIn all his past, a shore landing had meant a landing in grimy clothes,\r\nsmoking and drinking in grimy bars, the foetor of the dock-side. Never\r\nbefore had he found himself walking in a clean, bright city, in clean,\r\nnew clothes. It was delightful, new, absolutely new, and filled with\r\nthe freshness of surprise.\r\n\r\nA pretty capresse girl glanced at him, and that was the last touch to\r\nhis vanity; he entered the office of the _Compagnie Transatlantique_,\r\nwhere Sagesse left him, walking with an assured step, made his\r\ndeposition before the manager and one of the port authorities who was\r\npresent, signed it, and then, quite sure of himself and disregarding\r\nSagesse’s advice, demanded an indemnity for his lost kit and his wages\r\nup to date.\r\n\r\nFor once the wise Sagesse had given the wrong advice, for the manager,\r\non his own responsibility, and partly, perhaps, as a tribute to the\r\ncleanest and most self-respecting stoker he had ever fallen in with,\r\nmade out an order for the money demanded, cashed it, and Gaspard left\r\nthe office richer by a hundred francs.\r\n\r\nThe tide of luck was in full flood that morning, and he did nothing to\r\nspoil it; as he passed along with the moving crowd, cafés called out to\r\nhim to come in and celebrate the occasion, but he passed them by; he\r\nhad no need of the help of alcohol; the bright light, the colours, the\r\nmovement around him, and the light-hearted, yet languorous atmosphere\r\nof the gay city set all his southern nature aglow; just as blue eyes\r\nare made bluer by blue attire, so the opal of the south in his mind\r\ntook brighter colours from the bright colours around it.\r\n\r\nThe insect had found a leaf similar to the leaf on which it was born.\r\n\r\nUnconscious of the fact that he was marching straight upon his fate,\r\nhe passed along looking into the shops, strange shops without glass\r\nfronts or names, black shadows under arched doorways, shadows shewing\r\nmerchandise and coloured people, shadows casting perfumes of flowers\r\nand fruit, garlic scents.\r\n\r\nHe was crossing the little square where the diamond fountain jet was\r\ndancing and singing in the sun, when he saw before him the figure of\r\na girl. She was coming along in the full blaze of light, a girl of\r\nscarcely sixteen, tall, swift moving, and graceful as Atalanta, a\r\n_porteuse_, bearing on her head a tray of some merchandise covered over\r\nwith a wasp-coloured scarf.\r\n\r\nThe load would have taxed a man, yet she bore it as easily as a\r\nfeather; she wore no shoes, and her striped robe was caught up at the\r\nwaist to give her limbs free play, shewing her leg almost to the knee.\r\n\r\nShe was of that strange race, whose blood has been mixed with the blood\r\nof the Caribs, coloured like that Grecian statuary to which during a\r\nthousand years the sun has lent some trace of his gold, till one can\r\nimagine the sunlight lingering in the honey tints of the marble.\r\n\r\nThe blue black of her hair just shewed, covered with the turban of\r\nstriped material on which rested the tray.\r\n\r\nAs she came, walking erect and without a motion of the head, her dark\r\neyes glanced from side to side, and as she reached Gaspard her eyes met\r\nhis full, nor did they lower nor turn away till she had passed him.\r\n\r\nHe felt blinded as if by a flame. He turned. She was vanishing amidst\r\nthe crowd in the Rue Victor Hugo. He made a step as if to follow her,\r\nthen he stopped dead as though before a barrier.\r\n\r\nThe glance had only lasted a moment, yet in that moment, in a flash,\r\nthey had spoken one to the other. It was as though they had recognized\r\none another.\r\n\r\nHe could read a mysterious something in her glance, and it was as\r\nthough she had said, “Ah, there you are, from away beyond the beginning\r\nof time!”\r\n\r\nThe fountain was playing in the sun and a hundred men and women were\r\nmeeting and passing each other in the little Place, but it was the\r\nmeeting and passing of coloured phantoms.\r\n\r\nA man and a woman had just met and passed one another.\r\n\r\nA miracle of life had taken place, the old, strange miracle forever\r\nfresh, forever new. Yet nothing told of it, till, as he watched the\r\nmoving crowd into which she had vanished, suddenly, as if some belfry\r\nin the sky had swung to life, came the clash and ripple of bells.\r\n\r\nIt was the _carillon_ of the cathedral that rang thrice daily. Golden,\r\njoyous, sonorous; tenor and alto; beating the echoes to silver, waking\r\nghostly voices in the mornes and high woods, floating out over the blue\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE BELLS AND THE RAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt rains very often on the west of Martinique. The day is joyous,\r\nbrilliant, gaudy with the yellow of the city and the blue of sky and\r\nsea. Pelée, with his turban of cloud, sits tranquilly in eternal\r\nsummer, then, as though at the pointing of some wizard’s wand, it\r\nrains. Clouds overcast the blue, the thunder of the rain on roof and\r\nverandah mixes with the rush of rivulet and runnel.\r\n\r\nIt was as though the bells had called the clouds. Suddenly the people\r\nwere scampering, the rain was lashing. Gaspard, who had sought the\r\nshelter of a doorway, could hear the thunder of the verandahs all\r\nalong the Rue Victor Hugo, an arpeggio played by the fingers of the\r\nrain. Wind had risen, and from above came the voice of the great trees\r\nbeating their wet green bands together, the sigh of the palmiste\r\nbending to the wind, the whisper of tree ferns; from the street below\r\nthe Rue Victor Hugo came the fainter tune of rain-stricken verandah\r\nand flowing runnel, laughter, voices calling one to another across the\r\ndividing rain, the voices of children and, still, through it all, the\r\nbells.\r\n\r\nRain, wind, tree sounds, perfumes of new wet foliage and earth,\r\nspouting of the gouyave water, children’s voices, and through it all\r\nthe _carillon_ of the bells, sweet, joyous vibrant, like the voice of\r\nthe love that lives through darkness as through sunshine.\r\n\r\nAnd now, look! A burst of blue above; the bells have broken a way to\r\nheaven, a last thunder from the verandahs, like a parting salvo, and\r\nthe squall is making a rainbow over the blue sea.\r\n\r\nIt is over. The verandahs and shop doors are emptying, pretty faces are\r\nturned up to the sky as if to test the truth of its blueness, and white\r\numbrellas are opening against the sun.\r\n\r\nGaspard leaving shelter set out to find the Rue du Morne.\r\n\r\nHis mind was still filled with the image of the girl, the girl with the\r\nface of a beautiful child and the eyes of a woman, but the business he\r\nwas on soon drove her picture from his mind.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, can you direct me to the Rue du Morne?”\r\n\r\nMonsieur, an old Creole gentleman under a white umbrella, can and does,\r\nbut his directions are given in the Creole _patois_, and so rapidly\r\nthat what he says seems one word. Gaspard making out that the Rue du\r\nMorne lies somewhere below finds a side street leading downward to the\r\nblue dream of the harbour.\r\n\r\nOne could almost tumble into the harbour from here, at least in\r\nimagination. Never was there so steep a street, it is mostly steps,\r\nfoot-worn, moss-grown, murmurous with water, for the side runnels are\r\nin spate after the rain.\r\n\r\n“Madame, can you direct me to the Rue du Morne?”\r\n\r\nIn the street below an old Creole lady under a white umbrella, the\r\nfemale replica of the old gentleman in the street above, replies to the\r\nquestion volubly, and also seemingly in one word.\r\n\r\nHe gathers that it lies somewhere up above, but too lazy to climb he\r\npursues his way along the street which is a replica of the Rue Victor\r\nHugo. It is now getting towards the drowsy time of day. The streets are\r\nemptying. He enquires his way as he goes and everyone is delighted to\r\ndirect him. Sometimes it seems the Rue du Morne lies above, sometimes\r\nbelow; he comes to the conclusion that all these delightful people do\r\nnot know in the least what they are talking about. In another city he\r\nwould now be irritable, in St. Pierre he is only drowsy, mesmerised by\r\nthe hopeless search; it does not seem to matter a bit, he would just as\r\nsoon sleep under that coloured sky when it is filled with stars, as in\r\na room in the Rue du Morne, No. 3.\r\n\r\nA banana-coloured baby eating a banana at a doorway draws his\r\nattention, he is fond of children, and this thing, stark naked like a\r\nhoney-coloured cupid, attracts him.\r\n\r\nHe takes his hat off to it derisively.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, can you direct me to the Rue du Morne?”\r\n\r\nIt can, apparently, in a voice hoarse as a crow’s and with a thumb\r\npointed to the sky, then it vanishes into the house suspicious, maybe,\r\nthat it has been trapped into talking to a _Zombi_.\r\n\r\n_Zombis_ are evil spirits, shapes, wizards. Now, in a little street,\r\nsteep as a stairway, dusky with house shadows, framing a glimpse of\r\nblue sea, he asks the question for the last time of an old woman with a\r\npatient, kindly face, who has come to her doorway for a breath of air.\r\n\r\n“Yes, this is the Rue du Morne, and No. 3, this is it.”\r\n\r\nShe is Manman Faly.\r\n\r\nThey like each other at sight, and he explains what he wants, shews her\r\na handful of money, and follows her into the house.\r\n\r\nShe shews him into a room clean, but almost destitute of furniture.\r\n\r\nIn one corner is an “elephant,” not an animal, but a mattress two feet\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nIt is the thing he has been yearning for. St. Pierre has seized him at\r\nlast, the drowsy languorous spirit has been leading him by the arm for\r\nthe last half hour, it leads him now to the mattress and tells him to\r\nlie down. He does, and almost immediately falls asleep, whilst Man’m\r\nFaly closes the door and leaves him to take her own siesta.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening he wakes up, has some food, a drink at the bars by\r\nthe star-flashing harbour, returning sober and early to his room.\r\n\r\nThere is no glass to the window of his room—not a pane of glass in the\r\nwhole city, except maybe the coloured panes of the cathedral—and as\r\nhe lies fully awake before sleeping, he can hear through the slats of\r\nthe shutters, the voice of St. Pierre by night; the tune of a thousand\r\nrivulets, fountains, water-pipes.\r\n\r\nThe whole city is held by sleep, yet it sings the whole night long,\r\nanswering the sea below, and the woods above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nLOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the south, at night, the trees are full of voices. Dare you sit in\r\nthe woods of Martinique at night you would hear in the green twilight\r\nthat the moon makes through the leaves, an orchestra louder and more\r\nfantastic than ever filled a midsummer’s night’s dream.\r\n\r\nHere in the daytime there is silence. One can hear the waterfall, the\r\ndistant river, the wind in the trees above, sounds that only serve to\r\nmake the background of silence more apparent.\r\n\r\nAt high noon, when the light is fullest, when the heat is greatest, and\r\nthe wind above stricken dead, the silence of the woods is terrific.\r\n\r\nThere is no silence in the whole world like to this, unless it be the\r\ndumbness of a great multitude.\r\n\r\nAround you on all sides life is rocketing and blazing; orchids,\r\nhibiscus, bursts of bloom, ceibas, sand-box trees, air shoots of the\r\nwild pine blossom and riot, uncanny because of their demonstrative life\r\nin this silence.\r\n\r\nBut at dark all changes. Night rushes into the high woods like some mad\r\nmusician, conductor of an orchestra crazy as himself.\r\n\r\nThe blue day outside closes up swiftly like a great painted fan, just\r\nlike the pictures on a fan rapidly closed, St. Pierre tucks itself into\r\na pocket of shadow, the mornes and mountains are shrivelled up, Pelée\r\nalone remains sun-stricken still, then he, too, vanishes in a crease\r\nand as suddenly reappears; for the fan, flirted open again to its full\r\nextent, shews the same picture, only this time it is lit by starlight\r\nor the light of the moon.\r\n\r\nIt is with the first closing out of the light that the orchestra of\r\nthe woods begins; shrill, tremulous, like the bleating of a flock of\r\nlilliputian goats, the voices of the _cabritt-bois_ and his mates fill\r\nthe shadows, then the moon strikes the green heart of the forest and it\r\nsprings alive like a rattle. A million fantastic things give tongue.\r\nOne might fancy forms to fit the insect noises of the northern woods,\r\nbut the wildest imagination pauses before the possibilities of this\r\ntropical band, these drummers and harpers whose burr and rattle sways\r\nand surges beneath the farandole of the fireflies.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock, just as Pelée sights the coming sun, and the dawn is\r\ncoming over the sea like a lilac-coloured breeze, the _cabritt-bois_\r\nceases his bleating and Plong! the last harper plucks the final note\r\nfrom his harp-string. The drummers put up their drums, the oboe, and\r\npiccolo, the microscopic sax-horn player, the bones, and flute, pocket\r\nor shoulders their instruments and depart—for dreamland maybe.\r\n\r\nThey have made music all night, music that has reached even the\r\ndreamers of St. Pierre. The people asleep in the city become aware in\r\ntheir sleep that something has ceased, the faint haze of sound from the\r\ngreat wood above surrounds them no longer and they wake.\r\n\r\nGaspard awoke just as the wood music ceased. On the black floor of\r\nthe room the dawn through the slats of the shutter was laying seven\r\nblue-grey bars upon the floor.\r\n\r\nHe had been dreaming of the island and of Sagesse. They had burst into\r\nthe treasure ship and the strand was strewn with bars of gold. Then he\r\nlost Sagesse and was hunting for him and for Yves. It was full day, and\r\nthe island lay sweltering under the sun. He could see nothing of the\r\nman he was in search of; then, far away at the end of the little coral\r\npier he saw a form that made him forget both Yves and Sagesse, the form\r\nof a girl.\r\n\r\nAs he drew closer, he saw that it was the girl. The girl of the little\r\nPlace where the fountain played. The Place de la Fontaine as he called\r\nit in his own mind, not knowing its real name.\r\n\r\nShe was standing with her tray balanced on her head as though she had\r\njust landed, now she was laughing as she saw him coming towards her,\r\nlaughing as only the girls of Montpellier or Avignon can laugh and, as\r\nhe came along the ridge of coral he was laughing too, as he balanced\r\nhimself, fearful of falling. Then the ridge of coral became the yard of\r\na ship, the blue water below became distant, and the dream broke up.\r\n\r\nHappy dream. He had almost forgotten her last night, chatting and\r\nsmoking with foreign sailors at the bar of a tavern. She must have\r\nstruck him hard to make him dream about her like that, for in the dream\r\nit seemed to him he had known her a long time, that he was her declared\r\nlover; this girl whom he had never seen before and whom he might never\r\nmeet again.\r\n\r\nNow, a tap came to the door, and his landlady’s voice offered him\r\ncoffee or syrup. She brought the coffee in, and placed it on the floor\r\nbeside him and put the shutters aside, so that the window space became\r\na square dim disc of light, through which, with a breathing of wind,\r\ncame a tang from the sea below and a breath from the woods above.\r\n\r\nSt. Pierre was already astir; he could hear women’s voices and\r\nthe prattle of children, Creole street cries; unfamiliar voices,\r\nscents, and sounds came through the open window space, awakening him\r\nthoroughly, and awakening in him a keen sense of curiosity such as he\r\nhad never experienced in any other port.\r\n\r\nThe people here seemed different from the people anywhere else. Like\r\na child who, turning over the leaves of a dull book, comes upon a\r\nsurprising and joyously-coloured picture, he felt a pleasure he could\r\nneither analyse nor understand. An educated man would have felt as he\r\nfelt, but cursed by convention and knowledge, and the catch words of\r\nlanguage, he would not have felt it so freshly as this child of the\r\nsouth, who, like all the children of the south had some inborn love for\r\nall that the true poets sing about and true artists paint.\r\n\r\nHaving dressed himself he left the house. Man’m Faly was nowhere to\r\nbe seen, and the Rue du Morne was steeped in curious twilight shewing\r\nat its end an extraordinary vision of twilit sea, spreading out to\r\nghost-blue sea and out, away, and beyond the great mountain shadows, to\r\na sea of stainless azure.\r\n\r\nHe struck upwards to the street above, and then by a flight of steps\r\nto the Rue Victor Hugo. The street was astir. _Blanchisseuses_ with\r\nbundles making their way to the Rivière Roxelane, _calendeuses_ on\r\ntheir way to their employment, shopkeepers, children, _porteuses_\r\nbalancing their loads upon their heads, starting on the long journeys\r\nthese women make daily over the island, all moving in the twilight of\r\nvery early dawn with, overhead, the hyacinth-blue sky of morning.\r\n\r\nThe great fan picture of starlit city, sea, and wood, had been snapped\r\nto, and now the magic fan was slowly reopening to shew the same\r\npicture sunlit. Pelée and the sea were already in view, and as Gaspard\r\nmade his way along the Rue Victor Hugo, the day bloomed brighter\r\noverhead, dimness of hyacinths turning to the flashing of sapphires.\r\nThe air, though still surcharged with shadow, had in it now an obscure\r\nbrightness, a negative light that became positive where any bright\r\nsurface shewed, shadows were beginning to form, and the little fountain\r\nin the Place de la Fontaine was returning from a dancing and whispering\r\nghost to the form of a dancing diamond flower.\r\n\r\nHe followed the street as it dipped and rose and dipped again to the\r\nRivière Roxelane. He was wondering in what house of all this strange\r\ncity, what street, was hidden the girl of yesterday.\r\n\r\nHe had taken his way along the Rue Victor Hugo and through the little\r\nPlace, perhaps because it was there he had met her; who knows; he was\r\nquite unconscious of the manner in which she had taken hold upon him,\r\nand, infecting him with that dark glance, had caused something to\r\nstir and live in his blood; unconscious as the man who was yesterday\r\ninfected by malaria and to whom the first faint chill tells nothing of\r\nthe burning fever to follow.\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment on the bridge and looked down at the ghost-dim\r\nriver raving along to the sea; the banks seemed strewn with snow, it\r\nwas the linen of the washerwomen, he could hear their voices above\r\nthe rushing of the river, and the sound they made beating the clothes\r\nagainst the boulders.\r\n\r\nThen he passed on and found himself in the market-place on the Place du\r\nFort.\r\n\r\nLong before light, under the stars, boats from the fishing grounds had\r\nbeen making for St. Pierre, laden with the catch of the night. From\r\nCalebasse, Morne Rouge, Marigot, Vauclin, men and animals laden with\r\ncountry produce had come into the city before dusk on the previous\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nLight was now striking through the trees of the market-place, the\r\nstalls were set out and laden, boats had been dragged right up from\r\nthe shore on rollers, and their flashing cargoes were being unladen\r\nright at the stalls, great fish still quivering and jumping with life,\r\nan albicore, big almost as a shark, that took three men to lift, blue\r\nfish, black fish, silver fish, fish that looked as though carefully\r\npainted by hand, fish of all the forms that fish can possibly take, lay\r\nexposed on the stalls or were being unladen from the boats.\r\n\r\nWhen Gaspard entered the market the place was in shadow; flowers, fish,\r\nfruit were there, merchants to sell them, and people to buy them, but\r\nit was like a market-place in dreamland—a shadowy, yet living and\r\nmoving picture, almost voiceless—. Pelée is holding everything in his\r\nmesmeric gloom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is morning, yet it is not. Then, almost in a moment everything\r\nchanges, golden sunbeams stray through the leaves of the trees, the\r\nPlace du Fort becomes beautiful with bright light and liquid shadow,\r\nan unutterably blue sea is born suddenly, and as if by enchantment\r\nbeneath a sky of unutterable blue. The market-place thrills, fills\r\nwith voices, it is like a great cage of birds that break into chatter\r\nand song at the first touch of sunlight; you can hear the songs of the\r\n_canotiers_ from the sea, songs of the fishermen as they haul the last\r\nboatful of fish—hale it right through the market, laughing as they\r\nsing and followed by naked laughing children; girls’ voices, men’s\r\nvoices, buyers, sellers, idlers all mix and blend with the fresh voice\r\nof the sea. It has a touch of the morning of the world before the smoke\r\nof the first cities dimmed the beauty of the dawn, before man had\r\nlearned to weep and think. Here amidst the tamarinds and the early\r\nsunlight of the Place du Fort, for a moment you can catch the blue robe\r\nof the past, for a moment you can stand in the market-place of early\r\nAlexandria, for a moment you can glimpse the Agora of Athens in her\r\nearly youth, touch the summer that vanished before Rome flung out her\r\nbastions and those legions whose spears reflected the last gleams of\r\nthe Golden Age.\r\n\r\nFor a moment—then Finotte flutters before you in her wasp-coloured\r\nturban, basket in hand, and beautiful as a butterfly in her striped\r\nfoulard, and you are back again in St. Pierre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith these people a man of Gaspard’s class could fraternize and find\r\nfriends at sight. Touched with the spirit of the place, he laid hold of\r\nthe gunwale of the last boat and helped to haul her along, the Creole\r\nboatman laughing and chattering with him in the _patois_ which he only\r\nhalf understood. He was French and a man from the big ships, evidently\r\nout for a spree, that was enough for them. When they had got the boat\r\nin position at a corner of the fish market, for the place was divided,\r\nthe fish and meat being sold at one side, fruit, vegetables, and\r\nflowers at the other, they began to sell their fish right from the boat\r\nwithout troubling to put it on a stall.\r\n\r\nHeavens! what fish were in that boat, and what a picture they made\r\nfresh from the sea and still quivering; frilled, horned, spined,\r\nfantastically coloured. Black and red _perroquets_, _souris_ pink\r\nand orange, blue fish, yellow fish, all glittering like jewels;\r\ngelatinous masses that came in clinging to the nets, seaweeds. It was\r\nas though a great hand had been dipped in the tropical sea bringing\r\nup everything it could grasp. One looked for a mermaid—now the\r\nboatmen hammering with sticks were calling out their wares, holding\r\nup their fish, joking with the crowd; Gaspard joining in, his white\r\nteeth and dark eyes flashing, the picture of one of those boatmen one\r\nsees on the sea-steps of Naples, only better dressed. He had seized\r\na huge eel and was holding it up, in a moment it was gone, bought,\r\nand Pierre-Alphonse—so he had dubbed the chief boatman—nicknaming\r\nhim with any name that came first into his head, as these men do—was\r\npocketing the coins. Pierre-Alphonse had conducted the barter whilst\r\nGaspard had held the eel, a pretty girl had bought it and carried it\r\noff in her basket, and now Pierre-Alphonse seizing a monster shaped\r\nlike a little barrel, a _barrique de vin_—thrust it into the new\r\nsalesman’s hands. “Sell him too, thou man from the sea—Fish! fish!\r\nfish! who’ll buy?—all alive and breathing, all fresh from the water,\r\n_tonne_, _volant_, _balaou_, all leaping at thee. Hi Dodotte—Pauline,\r\nwhere are you going with your baskets—fill them.” He seemed to know\r\neveryone; the little children crowded round, he gave them handfuls of\r\n_sádines_, little white fish, let them pick seaweed out of the boat,\r\npatted them on the head, all with his left hand, as it were, whilst\r\nwith his right hand and the whole energy of his mind and body he\r\ncontinued selling. He was a big man, Pierre-Alphonse, with a big, dark,\r\nsmiling face good to look at altogether, and evidently a “character” of\r\nthe market, and a favourite.\r\n\r\nGaspard had sold the _barrique de vin_ to a syndicate of two old women\r\nwho had combined to buy it, and perhaps peddle it round town with other\r\nproduce, for they had with them a small cane truck, when, turning\r\nto the boat to find something else to sell, he saw in the midst of\r\nthe surrounding crowd the girl. She was without her tray, her little\r\nshapely head was bound with a yellow and blue madras, she had a basket\r\nin her hand, and she was coming to buy fish. Then she saw Gaspard.\r\nTheir eyes met and she instantly looked away.\r\n\r\nPierre-Alphonse saw her, too.\r\n\r\nNot only had she looked away, she had turned away.\r\n\r\nPierre-Alphonse’s mouth flew open:\r\n\r\n“Hi, Marie—Marie de Morne Rouge—ho, Marie, are you deaf this morning?\r\nHere are the fish calling thee—she’s gone—” Then to Gaspard, “Now\r\nwhat devil has got into the girl—she often buys from me, she was\r\ncoming, and she is gone—no matter, here is another _barrique_—sell\r\nhim, O thou man from the sea—”\r\n\r\n“Who is she?” asked Gaspard, taking the _barrique_.\r\n\r\n“Marie—whose father lives at Morne Rouge.”\r\n\r\n“Where does she live?”\r\n\r\n“With her aunt in the street of the Precipice. Ho, there, Mayotte, here\r\nis a fish for thee pretty as thyself—take it for nothing—next to\r\nnothing, two sous and it is thine, ’tis as big as a baby—”\r\n\r\n“What is she, this Marie?”\r\n\r\n“A _porteuse_—there, ’tis thine—wait till I get the change, and thy\r\nmother, how is she? All sweetly I hope—there, take thy change, little\r\none—” all in the _patois_ that takes the sharpness from words, makes\r\nnew words of old, a tropical growth of language, coloured, quaint,\r\ninfantile.\r\n\r\nGaspard turned to Pierre-Alphonse. “Well, I must be going, good luck—”\r\nHe disengaged himself from a fishy embrace and, followed by a shower of\r\ngood wishes from Pierre-Alphonse and his crew, mingled with the crowd.\r\nThe girl was nowhere to be seen, there were pretty girls everywhere,\r\nbut he had no eyes for them.\r\n\r\nWas she angry with him? Why had she turned away? Five minutes ago,\r\nas he stood there helping Pierre-Alphonse to sell his fish, he had\r\nforgotten her; if he had never seen her again he would not have\r\ntroubled very much; but, now, something inexplicable had happened, the\r\nworld had altered in a flash, it was as though to a man going blindly\r\nalong a misty road the vision of a beautiful and unattainable country\r\nhad suddenly appeared through a rent in the mist which closed again\r\ndestroying the vision, but leaving the dream. He was in love.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the Place, and wandered amongst the stalls where fruit,\r\nvegetables, and flowers were sold. Here the air had a heady and\r\nintoxicating perfume, the place was glorious with colour, piles, and\r\nmounds of colour, such fruit! such vegetables! such flowers! Egg\r\nplants, pommes d’Haiti, oranges—green oranges, tiny monkey oranges,\r\ngiant oranges—giant apricots each the size of a turnip, osier baskets\r\nfilled with green nutmegs, custard apples, guavas, white and green\r\nchristophines, prickly pears—then the vegetables, palm tops, and sweet\r\npotatoes, bread fruit—choux. And the flowers, grenadilla blossoms and\r\n_fleurs d’amour_, flowers of the Loseille Bois, delicate butterfly\r\nblossoms, poised as if forever in the act of taking flight. Gaspard had\r\nceased looking for the girl in the kaleidoscopic throng around him, he\r\nwas standing at a stall half of which was laden with fruit of every\r\ncolour, the other half with every coloured flowers when, turning, he\r\nfound that she was beside him.\r\n\r\nShe was quite unconscious of the fact. Wandering amidst the crowd she\r\nhad drifted against him, touched him with her elbow without being\r\naware of whom she was touching until he turned and their eyes met for\r\nthe third time in their lives; then, all at once, and as though the\r\nfaint reflection of a rose had been cast upon her face and neck, she\r\nblushed—it was less a blush than a deepening of the southern dusk\r\nbeneath her skin.\r\n\r\nIt told him at once that she recognised him, not only that; in some\r\nmysterious way it told him that she had been thinking of him. It gave\r\nhim courage.\r\n\r\n“_Bonjour_, mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“_Bonjou_, missie.”\r\n\r\nIt was the salutation that everyone gave to everyone else in St.\r\nPierre, strangers, friends, everyone. She was passing on when, picking\r\nup a spray of the _fleur d’amour_ from the stall and flinging some\r\ncoins on the board, he handed the branch laden with delicate blossoms\r\nto her. She took it, glanced at him with a half smile, then she looked\r\nat the flowers as though she had never seen flowers before, her lips\r\nwere moving, she was murmuring something, speaking to the flowers, to\r\nthe branch, “Oh, thou art pretty—thou art sweet.” Then she had passed\r\naway; with a glance and a little bow to the giver of the flowers she\r\nhad dissolved before his sight in the coloured moving throng.\r\n\r\nBut her voice remained with him, the caressing words she had spoken to\r\nthe flowers in the infantile French of the tropics.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thou art pretty—thou art sweet—” She had spoken to the flowers,\r\nbut it seemed to Gaspard she had spoken of herself. She had described\r\nherself unconsciously in a sentence.\r\n\r\nHe passed on. He did not wish to find her again just then. The vision\r\nheld him satisfied for the moment. She was not angry, more than that,\r\nshe was not indifferent. To this man, direct and fierce in love as in\r\nhate, this girl of his own class was a revelation, she seemed less a\r\nwoman than a flower that had suddenly blossomed in his path.\r\n\r\nThe elements of all the grandest poetry live in the commonest man;\r\ndeaf to the stuff of the drawing-room ballad maker, blind to the\r\nembroideries of art, the eternal terrors and beauties of nature\r\nmove him much or little as the case may be, but they move him. The\r\ncommonest man would have felt something of the poetry, simple, and\r\nsweet, yet exotic and beyond words fascinating, which this girl carried\r\nwith her—cast around her as the _fleur d’amour_ casts its colour and\r\nperfume.\r\n\r\n“O thou art pretty—thou art sweet—” He was turning to leave the\r\nmarket-place when a scream from one of the market women made him wheel\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThe stall just behind him had been upset, the crowd was scattering in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\n“_Fer de lance—fer de lance!_”\r\n\r\nThe cry echoed from one end of the Place to the other, and Gaspard\r\nfound himself standing alone, face to face with an old gentleman\r\ndressed in white and holding a white umbrella over his head.\r\n\r\nThe old man, though seemingly paralysed by terror, had not dropped his\r\numbrella. His eyes were fixed on the ground where, writhing in the\r\ndust, a yellow snake was raising its head to strike him.\r\n\r\nIt was a _fer de lance_, young, about three feet in length, but\r\nterrible as Death himself. It had come to market hidden in the great\r\nclusters of yellow bananas, frightened and ferocious; hating the\r\nsunlight, it was preparing to strike at the man before it, terror\r\nstriking at terror.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the reptile left Gaspard quite unperturbed. The smallest\r\nminority of the great human race are certainly the people who have\r\nno dread of snakes. Gaspard belonged to this few, a strange fact\r\nconsidering his imaginative nature. It is true he knew nothing of the\r\n_fer de lance_ and its terrors, but if he had, I doubt if he would have\r\ndone otherwise than he did.\r\n\r\nThe snake, obsessed by its objective, did not perceive the fearless\r\nenemy behind it; springing forward in a flash Gaspard seized it\r\nnaked-handed just below the horrible triangular head; seizing it four\r\ninches lower down with his left hand he almost twisted the head from\r\nthe body, breaking the spine at the neck. Then he flung the remains on\r\nthe ground and planted his heel on the head, crushing bone and demon\r\nbrain, and burning eyes into the dust.\r\n\r\nThe next moment it seemed to him that the world had gone mad and was\r\ntrying to smother him. The old man he had saved was clinging to his\r\nneck, the whole market was surging round him; men laughing, women\r\nweeping, and crying out to the Virgin. One might have thought Gaspard\r\nthe bearer of the news of some national triumph, the saviour of the\r\nisland—that is to say, if one were not acquainted with the Creole\r\nmind and its excitability. Then a ring was formed and he found himself\r\nin the centre of it, the old man—still with the umbrella over his\r\nhead—holding his hand, shaking it, and talking at the same time.\r\n\r\n“I am Monsieur Seguin, any of these good people here know me—” murmurs\r\nof assent from the crowd, “you have saved my life at the risk of your\r\nown, I am your friend. Ask what you will, I am not poor, my house is\r\nyours, and all I possess. My life is yours, for have you not saved it?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing,” cried Gaspard, “I have done nothing. I am not\r\nafraid of snakes—” then with a touch of Tartarin in his tone, “They\r\nnever bite me.”\r\n\r\nThey never bit him! He who had never handled one before—but the\r\ncrowd knew nothing of this, they took it as a statement of fact. This\r\nman, then, was a prodigy, he handled the dreaded _fer de lance_ as a\r\npoulterer handles a chicken. Before noon that fact had become the news\r\nof the day in St. Pierre, and Gaspard half a hero, half a wizard.\r\n\r\n“All the same,” said old M. Seguin, “you have saved my life, monsieur,\r\nbut I will thank you in another place than this—have you breakfasted?\r\nNo? Well then, I pray of you come with me and accept of my hospitality.”\r\n\r\nWith his hand upon Gaspard’s arm he led him away through the crowd\r\nwhich divided before them, across the Place, across the Rivière\r\nRoxelane, into the Rue Victor Hugo.\r\n\r\nHere at a café they breakfasted.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal the old gentleman who had a strong and vivacious\r\npersonality of his own, questioned his guest as to his past, present,\r\nand future. Though good-hearted, evidently, and evidently a power in\r\nSt. Pierre, M. Seguin was not of the highest refinement. He shewed this\r\nin the manner in which he cross-questioned his _vis-à-vis_, for at\r\nonce he had gauged Gaspard’s social position and his manner was that\r\nof an employer standing treat to an employée, but his every movement\r\nand every word, the tone of his voice and the kindness in his old eyes\r\nproclaimed the fact that he was a “straight man.”\r\n\r\nGaspard told of the wreck, and sketched his story till he came to the\r\nname of Sagesse.\r\n\r\n“Sagesse!” cried his questioner. “Pierre Sagesse?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—that is his name.”\r\n\r\nOne might have fancied that another _fer de lance_ had shown itself,\r\nso great was the loathing and hatred that appeared in the face of M.\r\nSeguin. Then he smothered his emotions and helped himself to more\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n“Beware of that man. He is not a man, he is a _fer de lance_.\r\nPoisonous. He landed you here? Well, you will of course have no more to\r\ndo with him.”\r\n\r\nGaspard explained that he was bound to go on an expedition with the\r\nsaid _fer de lance_ as soon as _La Belle Arlésienne_ had cleared her\r\ncargo. He said nothing of the treasure or the object of the expedition,\r\nbut I doubt if he had, whether M. Seguin would have heard him.\r\n\r\n“But you will not go.”\r\n\r\n“But I must—I have given my word.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you have given your word. Well, a word given must not be taken\r\nback even from Pierre Sagesse. But do not get entangled with him if you\r\ncan help it. Look!” He pointed to a huge spider passing along the wall.\r\n“That is Pierre Sagesse. He is a man-spider, who treats other men as a\r\nspider treats flies. Gets them into his power, binds them up, and sucks\r\nthem dry. He is my greatest enemy,” said the old man frankly enough,\r\n“and I am the only man who has ever got the better of him. He hates me.\r\nI think I am the only man he really hates; a nature like his does not\r\ngive itself to hate, it would be a waste of energy.” Then suddenly,\r\n“Has he bound you?”\r\n\r\nGaspard, surprised at the question and its far-reaching nature, was\r\nabout to reply. But the old man had read the fact in his face.\r\n\r\n“Don’t trouble to say it—only this—if he has, Paul Seguin will be\r\nyour friend. Ah, you do not know Sagesse. He has numerous poor folk\r\nhere quite under his horrid thumb, men to whom he has lent money, men\r\nwhom he has got power over, and he works them like slaves, negroes.\r\nWell, now, when you come back from this expedition you will stay in\r\nSt. Pierre, and you will let me put you in the way of making money. I\r\nown many of those boats that go to the fishing. I can make you quite a\r\ncomfortable place, and you will settle amongst us and marry some pretty\r\ngirl. A fine fellow like you will have his pick of the best.”\r\n\r\nGaspard laughed. Here was a prospect if the treasure hunt turned out\r\nfruitless.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_,” said he. “I will take your offer righthanded. I have never\r\nstruck such a place as this, and I never hope to leave it when I return\r\nfrom this voyage—and to think that I should have the luck to meet you\r\nall through a snake.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said M. Seguin, “there is a Martinique proverb that says,\r\n‘He who kills a snake is forgiven seven deadly sins.’ So you have\r\npurged yourself of seven sins and made a friend for life—do not let us\r\ndespise snakes.”\r\n\r\nFor the first time Gaspard felt the pleasantness of the fact that he\r\nhad that morning saved a life. Dead Yves appeared before him. Here was\r\na life to balance that life he had taken. Then in a flash appeared\r\nbefore him Anisette, selling drinks at the bar of the Riga. Heavens!\r\nwas it possible that he had ever loved or thought of that tallow-faced,\r\nunder-sized creature!\r\n\r\nMarie, Marie of Morne Rouge, had slain the evil shade of Anisette in\r\nhis mind, just as a sunbeam slays a shadow.\r\n\r\nThen he said good-bye to M. Seguin, promising to call and see him at\r\nthe address which the old man gave him upon a card.\r\n\r\nHe turned down hill to the sea front where on the Place Bertine, amidst\r\nthe sugar hogsheads, talking to one of the port officials, he saw\r\nSagesse. The owner of _La Belle Arlésienne_ was laughing, gesticulating\r\nand, as Gaspard passed to emphasise some remark, he brought his great\r\nthumb down on the top of a sugar cask.\r\n\r\nGaspard could not but remember M. Seguin’s words about the unfortunate\r\npeople under that “horrid thumb.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMARIE OF MORNE ROUGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe street of the Precipice hung literally between sea and sky; almost\r\nas steep as a ladder, so steep that the causeway here and there broke\r\ninto flights of steps, just as a river breaks into waterfalls. You\r\nsaw, looking upwards, far above you, the green of the high woods, and\r\nlooking downwards, far below you the harbour, blue at noon and emerald\r\nin the morning. Nothing could be more beautiful in its way than this\r\nold, narrow, unfashionable street during those hours in the morning\r\nwhen the harbour, gauze-green and ghostly, gazed up as through a well\r\nof twilight at the woods, black-green against the brightening sky.\r\n\r\nOld as the time of Josephine, the street of the Precipice held in these\r\nmorning hours the twilight of romance. The murmurs of the sea below\r\nand the woods above, the trickling and tinkling of the gouyave water\r\nflowing down its runnels seemed voices speaking of the past, times long\r\ngone, women vanished, men once brave—now ghosts.\r\n\r\nIn the full blaze of noon, the old street shone out bright with colours\r\nand moving with people; then, as the hour of siesta approached, it\r\ngradually emptied, the great heat of afternoon seemed to dry up its\r\nstream of life, the song of the _calendeuse_ over her work, the note of\r\na guitar, voices from the harbour side seemed less sounds than echoes\r\nof sound, green lizards slipped from shadow to shadow or basked openly\r\nin the heat. Then as the sun declined, the old street began to speak\r\nagain and live, the sunset rushed up it like a torchbearer, setting\r\nfire to roof and gable, yellow house wall, coloured garments of women,\r\nup, up, lighting the woods far above—lighting the stars and leaving\r\nthem burning and leaping in the dusky blue.\r\n\r\nThis was the children’s hour. You could hear their voices as they\r\nplayed, told their stories, sang their songs, whilst the blue above\r\nbecame more dark, more definite, more filled with stars.\r\n\r\nIt was here in this old street that Marie lived with her aunt, Man’m\r\nCharles, in a house on the right as you went up from the harbour and\r\nclose to the passageway leading to the Rue Buonaparte.\r\n\r\nBorn sixteen years ago up at the village of Morne Rouge, she had paid\r\nfor life the greatest payment that life can extract from a human being.\r\nShe had lost her mother. Her father, who owned the only shop in the\r\nvillage, had been fairly prosperous in a small way; besides the shop\r\nhe owned a small farm, and three times a week he would come into the\r\nmarket at St. Pierre to sell his produce, leaving the shop to the\r\ncare of his sister, Ti Finotte, a woman of forty, a woman once tall,\r\nstately, beautiful as any woman in Martinique, but now a cripple,\r\nbroken down, slain by hard work. She had been a _porteuse_.\r\n\r\nThe _porteuse_ of Martinique is a race apart; she is in reality a\r\npeddler, selling everything from fruit to ribbons. She carries her\r\ntray upon her head and her goods upon the tray, and her load would\r\nbreak an Englishman down were he to carry it half a dozen miles. She\r\nthinks nothing of it. Wonderful is not the word for the work done by\r\nthese women, graceful, sometimes slightly built, often beautiful, who,\r\nwith their loads perfectly balanced, bare-footed, dressed in clothing\r\nslight as the clothing of the ancient Greeks, will travel fifty miles\r\nin a day from village to village, over hill and dale, under the\r\ntropical sun, joyous as children, pleasant, sweet to look upon, yet\r\nfated to die at last—from overwork!\r\n\r\nYet they do not complain, nor do they look back on their lives with\r\nbitterness; hard though the work is, it is free from constraint of\r\nwalls and houses and masters; it is lonely passing from village to\r\nvillage amidst the mountains, but they have the companionship of sun\r\nand wind and distance. So Ti Finotte, though she was dying from the\r\nhardships of life and though she loved little Marie, made no opposition\r\nwhen Marie’s father declared his intention of making a _porteuse_ of\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\nMarie was four years of age when he came to this decision, and he came\r\nto it because he could see no better future for her. Since the birth\r\nof Marie he had fallen upon evil days; wishing to extend his farm, he\r\nhad borrowed money, and he had borrowed it from Sagesse, then a rising\r\npower in St. Pierre; a bad crop and a tornado crippled him in this new\r\ndevelopment of his business, he had to apply to Sagesse for another\r\nloan, and from that dated his ruin.\r\n\r\nThings always worked in a diabolical manner in favour of Sagesse: If\r\nhe lent a man money something was sure to happen to prevent that man\r\npaying the interest or working off the debt; then, when his business\r\nhad been seized by the money-lender things would take a turn, trade\r\nwould revive, crops would be splendid—and the benefit would fall to\r\nSagesse.\r\n\r\nIt was so with the father of Marie. The year after his property had\r\nfallen into the hands of the money-lender a wave of prosperity passed\r\nover Martinique. He still lived at Morne Rouge, the paid servant of\r\nSagesse, overseeing the little farm that once was his own, he saw the\r\ncanes growing so heavy and so tall that the harvesters could scarcely\r\nmake way amidst them, the bananas bending beneath the weight of their\r\nhuge yellow clusters, yet he did not grumble; it was Fate, and he made\r\nthe best of the business for himself and Marie.\r\n\r\nWhen Marie was fifteen and old enough to begin the business of\r\n_porteuse_, Ti Finotte died, and Marie came to live with the aunt in\r\nthe Street of the Precipice and to act as _porteuse_ in the employ of\r\nM. Sartine, the dealer in foulards, ribbons, madras handkerchiefs,\r\nand women’s apparel, whose shop was in the Rue Victor Hugo. The death\r\nof Ti Finotte had stricken the child to the heart, for she was still\r\nbut a child despite her fifteen years and her figure, tall, straight,\r\nsupple—almost the figure of a woman; the change from the sun-blaze of\r\nMorne Rouge to the shadowy old street of the Precipice had seemed part\r\nof the mournful change that had come in her life with the death of the\r\nwoman who had been a second mother to her; her aunt, Man’m Charles, a\r\n_calendeuse_ by trade, was a stern woman, religious, a devotee, and\r\nwithout much heart or sympathy for young people—yet in a fortnight the\r\ngirl had adapted herself to her new life and had come to love the old\r\nstreet, its voices, its colours, its dimness, and its mystery.\r\n\r\nIt had told her its secret. A secret that could only be told to a\r\npoet or a child. Man’m Charles knew nothing of this secret, the\r\ntraders and hawkers, the brazier who lived by the passageway into\r\nthe Rue Buonaparte, the baker whose shop was opposite the brazier’s,\r\nknew nothing of it. For them it was just a street, for Marie it\r\nwas a mystery half understood. The old houses, the shadows, the\r\nsteps moss-grown and tread-worn, the twilight of early morning, the\r\nwhispering of the gouyave water, all these spoke to her, telling her\r\nthings—things about the past, things about the future, hints of the\r\nmystery of life—as though the people who had once lived there and\r\nloved there had left some voice behind them, some echo of their story.\r\n\r\nThree days a week, early in the morning, just as Pelée was showing hard\r\nagainst the dawn, she would leave for M. Sartine’s, receive her tray of\r\ngoods and start on her journey, carrying it as though it were a thing\r\nof no weight.\r\n\r\nTo see her life and work, one must follow her as, leaving the Rue\r\nVictor Hugo, up through the steep and twilit streets, she passes,\r\nmoving as no woman can move who does not walk bare-footed, passing\r\nwith the silence of a ghost and the grace of Atalanta, giving good-day\r\nto every one she meets, friends or strangers, up, up, past the Rue\r\nPeysette, the Rue Petit Versailles, till the houses begin to disappear\r\nand the road turns from a street to a country road set on either side\r\nwith balisiers, gigantic ferns, whispering canes; scented with damp\r\nearth and the perfume of the night jasmine.\r\n\r\nUp here, were she to look back, she would see the city at her feet\r\nstill twilit and half asleep, the bay blue but still filled with\r\nnight, and beyond the shadow of the island, away to the west, the sea\r\nsparkling in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nBut she does not look back nor turn her head. Her eyes, ever on the\r\nwatch for the dreaded _fer de lance_, are fixed on the roadway before\r\nher.\r\n\r\nEvery moment, the sky above is becoming more filled with light, and as\r\nshe climbs it seems to her that she is climbing to the sunlight; now,\r\nthe road, more level, is turning the great shadow of Pelée, and before\r\nher the twilight of morning is turning to the blue of day.\r\n\r\nThe road takes a sharp bend, she turns it, and she is enveloped in a\r\nflame of sunshine, the warm blowing trade wind which the mountains shut\r\noff from St. Pierre blows in her face. _Zombis_, snakes, evil spirits,\r\nall the Fears that haunt darkness, are banished by the sunlight, blown\r\naway by the wind.\r\n\r\nAway up here, so high above everything, she seems the only person in\r\nthe world; there is not a soul in sight; cane fields, valleys, mornes,\r\nmountains purple and blue, the dazzling azure sea—distances and\r\ncolours lie before her. Silence and sunlight.\r\n\r\nShe always pauses here as one pauses when one meets a friend. The\r\ngreatest poet, the meanest man, would do the same in face of this\r\nsupreme loveliness.\r\n\r\nAs she looks from the blue sea to the green mornes and from the mornes\r\nto the blue mountains over which La Trace, the great white highroad,\r\npasses like a narrow white ribbon, she talks to it all in an undertone.\r\nShe knows nothing of where the sea leads to, she knows nothing of the\r\nsun, or whether the earth moves round him or he round the earth, she is\r\nignorant of these things as the prehistoric woman. That is perhaps why\r\nshe understands it all so well, this great picture to which she speaks\r\nin an undertone, caressingly as a child speaks to its mother.\r\n\r\nThen the road draws her back again and she passes on with her burden on\r\nher head, walking swiftly and easily, straight as a flame, a beautiful\r\npicture against the whispering canes that line the road, the palmistes,\r\nand the ferns.\r\n\r\nHer journey may be as far as Grande Anse, she may be going to sell her\r\ngoods at Calabasse, at Marigot, or Vauclin; far or near, it is all the\r\nsame to her.\r\n\r\nAt noon, she is travelling still; across those blue hills in the\r\ntorrid light of midday you will find her passing on her way; she has\r\nsold some of her goods, and there are coins in the little bag at her\r\ngirdle. But she is not thinking of them. Of what is she thinking? Ah,\r\nif you were to lead her life, always active, always in the open air,\r\nyou would know that thought can live in suspension. Not the suspension\r\nof sleep, but of half slumber, wide awake to all external things, yet\r\ndwelling on none especially. She would see, as she went, the hills\r\nchange as the road turned, far mountains vanish as the road dipped, and\r\nreappear as it rose again, distant vistas of blue sea peeping at her\r\nbetween the mornes, fields of green cane waving to the breeze, woods\r\nbreaking into view; and the woods would push the sea aside and the cane\r\nfields take the place of the woods, and the green mornes of the cane\r\nfields, and the sea of the mornes. So full was she of life and energy\r\nthat movement, so far from tiring her, was more pleasant than rest,\r\nmesmerising her, lulling her, till at times it almost seemed as though\r\nshe were not moving at all, that it was the scenery which was moving,\r\nhills, fields, mountains, and sea, shifting, altering, giving place one\r\nto the other to peep at her on her journey.\r\n\r\nIn a year she was known all over the island. The negroes cutting\r\nthe cane would pause to look at Marie of Morne Rouge, the prettiest\r\n_porteuse_ in Martinique, and give her good-day; at the villages where\r\nshe called with her wares, she did a better trade than any other\r\n_porteuse_; her prettiness had little to do with this success, for\r\nher customers were women, but she had a way with her, an innocence, a\r\nsweetness, that made her pleasant as a rose.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, in Martinique, where hearts are as inflammable as\r\ntinder, she had admirers, scores, hundreds—but she had no lover.\r\n\r\nWhen young men came to talk to her they found themselves at a loss\r\nbefore this girl who spoke to them eye to eye, frankly, freely, as a\r\nfriend might speak to a friend. She did not seem to know that she was a\r\ngirl; other girls—all the girls in St. Pierre of her age—had lovers,\r\nvisions of Love, visions of Cupids with tinsel wings, wedding wreaths,\r\nall the frippery that goes to make marriage the woman’s pageant. Marie\r\nhad no visions of these things. Her mind was of that rare order of\r\nwoman’s mind which holds all the love of heaven in solution, but no\r\nimage of Love till the man she is fated to meet meets her, glances at\r\nher, speaks to her, and at a stroke makes her his forever.\r\n\r\nThese are the women who are the heroines of the real tragedies of\r\nlife—and of the immortal tales of Love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nFATE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, M. Sartine sent Marie to call at a house on the highroad that\r\nleads across the Morne Parnasse. Her business was to shew some lace to\r\na Spanish lady, Señora Vigil, and to sell it if possible.\r\n\r\nThe Señora had come to Martinique by chance; she had taken this\r\nhouse—the Château Principe—by chance, and yesterday she had entered\r\nM. Sartine’s shop by chance to buy some lace. She might just as easily\r\nhave gone to the shop of M. Custine, or to the Fleur d’Avril, or to the\r\nBon Marché, but chance—whose other name is Fate—led her into the shop\r\nof M. Sartine.\r\n\r\nMarie, who had sold the whole quantity of lace to the Señora, was\r\nreturning to St. Pierre well pleased and in high spirits. It was her\r\nsixteenth birthday and it had brought her the pleasantest surprise in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nFinotte, Dodotte, Florine, Honorine, all her girl friends and\r\nacquaintances, had remembered the day; each had brought a little\r\npresent, a trifle, less than a trifle, a box of sea shells blazing with\r\ncolour, a scarf, a string of beads—the brazier across the way and the\r\nbaker, had remembered her; they did not bring presents, but they called\r\nout good wishes as she passed. Her aunt gave her the rarest thing she\r\never gave to anyone—a smile. She had not known that any of these\r\npeople had cared for her till this morning, when her birthday made them\r\nspeak. And she had told no one of her birthday, or only one girl,\r\nFinotte—she must have spread the news.\r\n\r\nThen, she had been entrusted with the lace selling by M. Sartine, a\r\nmost important business, in which she had succeeded. The Señora had\r\nspoken kindly to her, asked her her age, and discovering that it was\r\nher birthday, had given her a little old-fashioned cross wrought in\r\nsilver and with the blessed Saviour upon it. “It has been blessed by\r\nthe Archbishop of Santa Cruz,” said the Señora, “and whilst you keep it\r\nnothing evil can hurt you.”\r\n\r\nIt had been a wonderful morning. The sun was full in the sky as she\r\ncame along the road past the Jardin des Plantes. The gates were open,\r\nthey were always open, rusty and gone to decay; she could see in\r\nthrough the great arch of twilight made by the trees. In there amidst\r\nthe palms and great tropical trees a bird was singing, calling, filling\r\nthe echoes with its golden, flute-like notes. It was a _siffleur de\r\nmontagne_. She paused and looked in. The great garden, once carefully\r\ntended, had gone to decay, the lianas hung like ropes between the\r\ntrees; palmiste and tree fern, cedar and locust, all were roped and\r\ntangled by the lianas, the scent of vanilla came on the air from the\r\ngreen gloom, vanilla, and green orange, wet mould, the sad odour of\r\ndecaying leaves.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful and mysterious place, the Jardin des Plantes;\r\nlaid out when Versailles was filled with courtiers, beautiful when\r\nJosephine, not yet an empress, walked its paths, nothing dreaming of\r\nNapoleon or her fate; long gone to decay and given over now to Nature,\r\nwho was slowly taking it back to herself.\r\n\r\nMarie, when she passed the gates, always looked in fascinated and half\r\nfrightened at the silent riot of trees and shrubs; but to-day it seemed\r\nless gloomy; the voice of the bird seemed to fill it with light.\r\n\r\n“Marie! Marie! Marie! _Bonjour_, Marie—Marie de Morne Rouge,” sang\r\nthe bird. She made a lovely picture as she stood in the sunlit road,\r\nlistening with a half smile to the liquid golden notes of the _siffleur\r\nde montagne_.\r\n\r\n“Marie! Marie! Marie! _Bonjour_, Marie—Marie de Morne Rouge.”\r\n\r\nThen she sighed, turned, and passed on her way. It was as though\r\nthe old garden where lovers had walked in days gone by had told her\r\nsomething, just as the old street of the Precipice had told her\r\nsomething. But what the garden told her was far less understandable;\r\nsomething new and strange and sad had spoken in the voice of the bird,\r\nin the silence of the green gloom. It was as though she had seen the\r\nvision of some lovely country, unattainable, a moment glimpsed, and\r\nthen gone forever.\r\n\r\nBut she came through the Place du Fort and across the bridge spanning\r\nthe Rivière Roxelane.\r\n\r\nThe washerwomen below were busy; she could hear their voices and their\r\nlaughter; the Rue Victor Hugo was filled with people; she knew many of\r\nthem, sister _porteuses_, shop-keepers, idlers, and gave them good-day\r\nas she passed.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was thinner as she drew near the little Place de la Fontaine,\r\nand she could see the water of the fountain like a diamond flower in\r\nthe sunshine. As she was crossing the Place she saw a figure in white\r\nclothes coming towards her. Her eye, keen and trained to observation,\r\nnoted at once that this was some stranger to St. Pierre, some man from\r\nthe foreign ships, no Creole.\r\n\r\nAs she passed him, she looked him straight in the face, frankly, just\r\nas she looked everyone in the face, man or woman; his eyes met her eyes\r\nfull, lit up, and—she had passed on.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was around her, but she did not see it. Someone had spoken to\r\nher without words; she had spoken to someone. The world for a moment\r\nseemed empty of people, containing only herself and that mysterious\r\nsomeone. She scarcely remembered his face except that it was dark, and\r\nvaguely good-looking; but the eyes held her soul. He had spoken to her\r\nas a man speaks to a woman with a glance; that was nothing compared\r\nwith the fact that she had spoken to him. It was as though something\r\ndumb in her, something of which she had never suspected the existence,\r\nhad awoken from sleep, escaped from darkness, spoken in a strange\r\nlanguage, and then sank back to darkness, leaving her bewildered and\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\nFor a moment as she went on her way the vision of the Jardin des\r\nPlantes rose before her, and the voice of the _siffleur de montagne_\r\nfollowed her: “Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie de Morne Rouge.” The\r\nold love-haunted garden and the bird seemed trying to tell her\r\nsomething—something impossible to understand, something beyond all\r\nsadness sad, and beyond all beauty beautiful.\r\n\r\nThen, drowning out everything, as though some belfry in the sky had\r\nflung open, came the sound of bells; it was the _carillon_ of the\r\ncathedral that rings twice daily, silver bells and golden bells, tenor\r\nand alto, answered by a thousand singing echoes from high wood and\r\nharbour, street and place, floating up to the blue sky, floating out\r\nover the blue sea.\r\n\r\n“Marie, Marie de Morne Rouge—_Bonjour_, Marie—Little _porteuse_,\r\nchild of the sun, listen to us, the bells, listen to us, the echoes—we\r\nare speaking the language he spoke, birds and echoes, bells and\r\nflowers, soul of woman and soul of man, one language only have they.”\r\n\r\n“Marie de Morne Rouge—Marie.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE FLEUR D’AMOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, as if challenged by the bells, the clouds around Pelée spread\r\nout fanwise, the sky darkened, and Marie, taking shelter beneath a\r\nverandah, heard the rush of rain as it swept down from street to street.\r\n\r\nThe darkness and the rain were like an omen—or might have been but for\r\nthe bells, ringing on, joyous, triumphant, like the love that lives\r\nthrough disaster and beyond death.\r\n\r\nShe heard the thunder of the rain on roof and verandah, the sky looked\r\nas though it would never clear again, and then, just as though the\r\nbells had broken a way to heaven, a blue rift shewed through the\r\nclouds, widened, spread wider still to a burst of sunshine and the\r\nclouds were passing away over the sea, sweeping it with meadows of\r\ntourmaline-coloured shadow.\r\n\r\nMarie, leaving the shelter of the verandah, turned to the shop of M.\r\nSartine, gave the account of her dealings with the Señora, received her\r\nmeed of praise from the old shopkeeper, who was an excellent-hearted\r\nman in all things in which money was not concerned, and departed for\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAs she left the shop and entered the Rue Victor Hugo, the world seemed\r\ncommonplace again, the bells had ceased ringing, the joyous morning had\r\npassed away as if the voices of the bells had carried it away out to\r\nsea with them.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the Street of the Precipice. Man’m Charles was in a bad\r\nhumour; Finotte, one of the girls whom she employed in her business,\r\nhad not turned up that morning and she was short-handed. The ill-temper\r\nwhich ought to have fallen to Finotte fell on Marie.\r\n\r\nIt is always just so in this world, the day that begins cloudless,\r\nwarm, and perfect, rarely lasts till sunset.\r\n\r\nThe girl who was never for a moment idle took the place of Finotte, one\r\nmight have thought that working as she did at the trade of _porteuse_\r\na holiday might have fallen to her occasionally on such a day as this,\r\nbut she did not grumble.\r\n\r\nShe set to work painting the great madras handkerchief without a murmur.\r\n\r\nThree other girls were working in the room with her, a dim room into\r\nwhich the blazing sunshine of the street outside scarcely penetrated\r\nthrough the green slats of the shutters. Pauline, Celestine, and\r\nFlorine were their names, and they chatted as they worked in the sweet\r\nchildish French of the tropics. It was like the chatting of birds in\r\na dimly lit cage. Celestine was to be married next month, Pauline and\r\nFlorine had lovers, Love, marriage, other girls’ lovers, heart-affairs,\r\nRosine jilted by the fisherman Ambrose, who had gone to live at Fort\r\nde France, Lys who had jilted Achille, who had threatened to drown\r\nhimself—so the conversation ran on. Birds one might imagine talking\r\nlike this, one to the other in the branches of the _loseille bois_ and\r\nthe tamarinds. Marie took no part in the conversation, she never did\r\nwhen the talk ran like this. To-day as she worked, she seemed even\r\nmore abstracted than usual. But she was listening—half listening,\r\nwondering why Lys had jilted Achille, why the fisherman Ambrose had\r\njilted Rosine, interested in the troubles of these people, though she\r\ncould not tell why. Yesterday their squabblings would have been quite\r\nuninteresting to her.\r\n\r\nThen as she worked, she saw things. The road over the Morne de\r\nParnasse, the green gloom of the Jardin des Plantes, the sun-stricken\r\nPlace du Fort, the Rue Victor Hugo and the Place de la Fontaine with\r\nthe diamond flower of the fountain glittering in the sun.\r\n\r\nWherever her thoughts might lead her, they always strayed back to the\r\nPlace de la Fontaine. Then she would see a white figure coming towards\r\nher. Her thoughts would try to escape, to turn back—impossible, they\r\nhad to go on, meet face to face that someone, meet again that gaze,\r\nanswer it—then only might she pass on to lose herself in the crowd,\r\nto meet the music of the bells, the _carillon_ of joy; voices from the\r\nwoods, echoes from the harbour side, music from heaven, echoes from\r\nearth, clasping her, folding her in waves of sound—\r\n\r\nJust as the waves of a tropic sea breaking on the shores of\r\nan islet may tell to a man the fact of man’s isolation and\r\nloneliness—loneliness that love alone can banish—so the waves of\r\nsound, brilliant, dim, sonorous or echo-broken, had told Marie the fact\r\nof woman’s isolation and loneliness.\r\n\r\nAll her life suddenly appeared to her as a great loneliness. It was\r\nas though she were standing on the shore of an islet and had suddenly\r\ndiscovered the fact for the first time that she was utterly alone, the\r\ndiscovery being brought to her by the glimpse of a far-off ship, a\r\nmomentary vision that had vanished, leaving her to her loneliness.\r\n\r\nThat is how real love first comes, analyse it to its depths, that\r\ntremendous wave which strikes all human beings at some time of their\r\nlife, the crest may be sunlit, joyous,—but the heart is from the great\r\nocean where loneliness is supreme. Lifted on the joyous crest, a man\r\nsees the object of his desire, the companion of his soul; if he does\r\nnot seize her, he will sink into the heart of the wave, the gloom of\r\nits loneliness, to be carried to the shore at last without ever seeing\r\nthe true sunlight again.\r\n\r\nAfter dark, when the stars were out and the voices of the children\r\nplaying in the streets had ceased, Marie went to her room, a room so\r\npoorly furnished that one might almost say it was not furnished at\r\nall. Just a mattress on the floor, a chair, a box of cedar wood where\r\nshe kept her clothes and her few possessions, and on the wall a little\r\nshrine to the Virgin, a tiny thing, gaudily painted, and with a little\r\ntrough to hold flowers.\r\n\r\nShe had been brought up in the Catholic faith, she placed flowers in\r\nthe little trough of the shrine and prayed to the Virgin, but I doubt\r\nif her faith was more than a fetish worship of the image of the Virgin,\r\nor if her religion gave her any comfort in bad times.\r\n\r\nTi Finotte had died and gone away into the darkness, the smiling Virgin\r\nin the little shrine could not stop that or say one word of comfort.\r\nIn her heart of hearts, she felt religion to be an entirely one-sided\r\naffair wherein Man did everything from good works to worship and the\r\nDeity nothing. But then she was only Marie, a being come from very far\r\naway. Her people had given the Caribbean Sea its name, had hunted the\r\nwild horses before our Saviour was born, were lost to sight behind\r\ncenturies of sunlight, and silence, and savagery. How could she see\r\nclearly the light, with the dawn of the world still in her eyes?\r\n\r\nShe went to bed and to the dreamless sleep that comes to the hard\r\nworker whose work lies in the open air. Next morning she was up before\r\nthe stars had paled, for her aunt had set her several tasks to do\r\nbefore breakfast time.\r\n\r\nAmongst other things, she had to go to the market to buy provisions,\r\nand it was there, you will remember, that she had her second meeting\r\nwith Gaspard, and his gift of the fleur d’amour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE ROAD TO GRANDE ANSE\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning very early Marie made her way to the Rue Victor Hugo,\r\nreceived her tray of goods, and started on her journey. It was a long\r\njourney to-day, right away to Grande Anse on the eastern side of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nShe passed up the steep twilit streets, up, up, past the Rue Petit\r\nVersailles, till the houses broke up and the way began to turn from a\r\nstreet to a country road.\r\n\r\nJust here she did what she had never done before, turned and looked\r\ndown at the city steeped in twilight.\r\n\r\nWith the heavy load of the tray she dared not bend her head. She stood\r\nwith head erect and eyes cast down, beautiful and statuesque as one of\r\nthe Greek Caniphori. She was thinking, “Ah, there is someone there, in\r\nwhat house is he, in which street, is he awake yet or does he still\r\nsleep?”\r\n\r\nThen, raising her eyes, she looked far over the sea, bright beyond\r\nthe shadow of Pelée and the hills. She was thinking, “He came from\r\nthere—where from beyond that wonderful bright sea did he come?” The\r\nsea had always been one of the mysteries of her life, and the ships\r\nthat came from away beyond the horizon.\r\n\r\nThen she turned and resumed her way along the twilit road filled\r\nwith the early morning scent of tropical woods and flowers, she had\r\nforgotten her fear of the _fer de lance_. _Zombis_ and evil shapes\r\nhad vanished from her path—those shadows of the mind that have no\r\nexistence when forgotten.\r\n\r\nYesterday, when she was leaving the market, she had heard the screams\r\nof the market-women and had turned to see _him_ surrounded with people.\r\nHe had killed the _fer de lance_ with his naked hand; snakes could do\r\nhim no harm, so the market people had said. That fact made the _fer\r\nde lance_ less fearful to her. He did not fear it, why should she? In\r\nthis tropical mind, sealed so long to love, Love had suddenly disclosed\r\nhimself full grown and statuesque.\r\n\r\nIt was as though in a tropical garden gone to a state of nature, some\r\nwind had pushed the foliage aside revealing the marble form of the\r\ngarden god, the statue that had been there since the garden was planted\r\nfirst, lurking amidst the leaves, and now seen for the first time. As\r\nshe turned the shadow of Pelée, the sunlight struck her, and the view\r\nlay spread as of old. The wonderful view of Martinique, its hills, and\r\nmountains, its fields of cane, and visions of distant sea.\r\n\r\nShe paused, as she always paused just here, to feel the trade wind\r\nand the warmth of the sun. There lay the mountains she had known from\r\nchildhood with La Trace, the white highroad, winding away across them,\r\nthe mornes, the valleys, the glimpse of the distant sea towards Fort de\r\nFrance. It seemed to her that she was looking at all this for the first\r\ntime. The world, since yesterday, had become new, a spirit, half gay,\r\nhalf sad, had infused itself into everything, the hills, the sea, the\r\ndistance—the world, since yesterday, would never be the same again to\r\nMarie of Morne Rouge.\r\n\r\nThe last time she had passed along that road, she had travelled without\r\nthought, careless as a child, free as a bird—now it was all different.\r\nShe could not tell in the least what had happened to her, she never\r\nconnected the change with love, the thing Finotte and Pauline chattered\r\nabout so glibly. She only knew that the great old hills were speaking\r\na new language to her and that Distance had become Loneliness.\r\n\r\nShe had travelled the white highroad many a time alone, yet she had\r\nnever felt herself alone till to-day.\r\n\r\nThen, as she went on her way along the road blazing in the sun and set\r\non either side with palmistes, tree ferns, bushes of grenadilla blossom\r\nand sun-stricken tamarinds, a voice said to her:\r\n\r\n“_Bonjour, mademoiselle._”\r\n\r\nThere was no one but herself upon the road, nothing moving but the\r\nshadows of the palm fronds shaken by the wind and the green lizards\r\nslipping across the dust in the sunlight. It was the voice of yesterday.\r\n\r\n“_Bonjour, mademoiselle._”\r\n\r\nShe called it up again and again and made it repeat the words, then she\r\nrecalled his face as she had seen it when glancing up at him to thank\r\nhim for the flower.\r\n\r\nShe had a companion now.\r\n\r\nHad you seen her passing, swift, silently, with her burden poised on\r\nher head, straight as a palmiste, enveloped in a flame of sunlight,\r\nwith her luminous eyes gazing straight into the distance before her,\r\nyou might have fancied her a somnambulist, a person walking in a\r\ndream—she was.\r\n\r\nAs she went on her way, she experienced a new sensation, it was as\r\nthough St. Pierre had attached itself to her by a thread, the further\r\nshe went, the tighter did this thread grow—“Come back” said St.\r\nPierre, “every step you take, takes you away from him, come back, you\r\ndo not know, he is a foreign sailor and may be carried away in one of\r\nthose mysterious ships, those ships that spread their sails and pass\r\naway beyond the blue horizon to be lost forever.”\r\n\r\nIt was up on the Morne du Midi that the voice of St. Pierre said this\r\nto her for the first time. She paused. The sun was high and pouring a\r\ntorrent of light on sea and land.\r\n\r\nThe sun rays seemed beaten back from the earth, rising in a vague and\r\ndazzling spray as the water of a torrent rises in a spray-cloud. The\r\nhills were indefinite, blue, and purple shapes, the sea had lost its\r\nhorizon and seemed part of the sky and the woods of the Morne du Midi\r\nwere as still as death. Nothing sings or stirs in the West Indian woods\r\nwhen the sun is holding the world like this.\r\n\r\nMarie, on the highest summit of the Morne, stood as though the silence\r\nof the world had suddenly stricken her, taking away movement and life.\r\n\r\n“Ah, if he were to leave St. Pierre! If she were to return and never\r\nfind him again!”\r\n\r\nShe had only seen him twice, she had only spoken to him a word, were\r\nhe to pass out of her life forever, it would be the passing away of\r\na spectre, a mist, a dream, but she would never love again. It was\r\nas though she had been waiting for him since the beginning of the\r\nworld, as though she had lived through the remote past, through the\r\nold Carib days, passing from re-incarnation to re-incarnation, through\r\nthe fervour of tropical days and nights, the silences of the tropical\r\nforests, without finding him. And now that she had found him, how would\r\nit be with her if she lost him?\r\n\r\nHer mind, absolutely virgin and frank as the mind of the prehistoric\r\nwoman, never paltered with words, she stood there on the morne, gazing\r\nat the vision of deathless love, supreme and mysterious happiness, torn\r\nby the thought—“Ah, should I lose it!”\r\n\r\nThere were still miles before her to be travelled before she reached\r\nGrande Anse, St. Pierre was calling her back, all her soul and being\r\ncraved to return; few women of Europe could have withstood that call\r\nof the heart, she had only to return, to wander through the streets,\r\nby the harbour, on the Place Bertine, and she would be almost sure to\r\nmeet him; but she had a trust to fulfil, the goods she was carrying had\r\nto be delivered at Grande Anse, Death might have stopped but would not\r\nhave prevented her in her endeavour to fulfil her trust, and Love was\r\npowerless over her in this simple matter as Death.\r\n\r\nThat was her character drawn in four lines. Capable of immortal\r\npassion, yet bound by a simple duty as matter is bound by gravity.\r\n\r\nThen she went on her road due east for Grande Anse, past the silent\r\nwoods, through the great white light of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHEY MEET\r\n\r\n\r\nGrand Anse is just a little town, gone rather to decay, on a cliff\r\nforever swept by the sun and the trade wind.\r\n\r\nIt is the most lonely place in the world and the most quaint.\r\n\r\nAt St. Pierre, on the west side of the island, the sea is deep and\r\nstill, morning comes late because of the shadow of the mountains, and\r\nthe sunset blazes up the streets like a conflagration. The first rays\r\nof sunlight touch Grande Anse, morning rushes on the town across great\r\nwastes of violet-coloured sea; the dawns are immense here, what you see\r\nis the lighting up of a world; on the one side, all the world of ocean\r\nquivering and leaping in light, on the other, all the island world.\r\nMountains springing to life against a sky still showing a trace of\r\nstars, the cloud turban of Pelée, first a luminous haze like some vast\r\nnebula just born, then a burning fleece of gold. Then, just as though\r\nthe shadows of night were a garment unloosed and let slip, the great\r\nmountain undrapes itself and stands a cone of emerald green, a pyramid\r\nof colour in the blue and voiceless sky.\r\n\r\nSt. Pierre is still in shadow, but the whole eastward side of the\r\nisland is burning in the sun. St. Pierre has its feet in the Caribbean\r\nSea, but Grande Anse is washed by the Atlantic. The south equatorial\r\ncurrent and the trade wind keep the shore forever booming with waves.\r\n\r\nMarie, as she came along the national road, could hear the sea like the\r\nbreathing of a vast shell, before the first houses of the town came\r\nin sight. She entered the main street, which is a continuation of the\r\nroad, stopped at the shop of M. Carbet, an old sun-dried Creole trader,\r\nwho could remember the time when Grande Anse was prosperous with sugar\r\nmills and plantations worked under the old regime of slavery. M. Carbet\r\ninspected the goods sent him by M. Sartine, loaded the tray with other\r\ngoods to be returned, and invited the girl to sit down and rest and\r\nhave some refreshment.\r\n\r\nWhen she had rested herself, having still an hour before she would\r\nstart on her return to St. Pierre, she left the old man to take his\r\nsiesta and came out to look at the sea.\r\n\r\nAlways, when she came to Grande Anse, she would, if she had time, come\r\nto the cliff edge to look at the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful sight, for the emerald waves come racing in on a\r\nsoot-black beach. Nowhere else is there a beach like that or such\r\ncurious colour effects; white foam, white gulls, blue sea, curving\r\nemerald waves, black sand. Over all the sunlight and the boom of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAs she stood, the trade wind blowing in her face and fluttering her\r\nrobe, she saw by the sea edge two white figures, the figure of an old\r\nman and a young man.\r\n\r\nThe old man was M. Seguin, the young man was Gaspard.\r\n\r\nM. Seguin, who had a house at Grand Anse and who lived there the\r\ngreater part of the year, finding the climate much more invigorating\r\nand far less rainy than the climate of St. Pierre, had met Gaspard\r\nyesterday evening, after having parted with him in the forenoon, and\r\nthe inspiration came to him to invite his new-found friend to Grande\r\nAnse. They had driven over and Gaspard was to return to-day.\r\n\r\nAnd away up on the Morne du Midi, Marie, quite unknowing the interest\r\nthat Fate was taking in her affairs, had struggled against the impulse\r\nto return to St. Pierre. Duty had won its struggle against Love, yet\r\nLove had gained his end. It was as though some subtle strategy had been\r\nworking behind the face of things.\r\n\r\nShe recognized the two figures instantly, she caught her breath—“It is\r\nHe!”\r\n\r\nAlmost as she sighted them, the two men began to turn their steps\r\nfrom the sea edge, and the first thing that struck their eyes was the\r\ngem-like figure on the little cliff outlined against the burning blue\r\nof the sky.\r\n\r\nM. Seguin, despite his sixty years, was as keen-sighted as his\r\ncompanion. He recognized the girl instantly, he had spoken to her\r\noften. The prettiest _porteuse_ in Martinique had no greater admirer\r\nthan M. Seguin.\r\n\r\nHe raised his stick by way of salutation and she on the cliff raised\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nThen she waited as the two men came across the black sand of the beach\r\nand began to climb the cliff path. She had no false modesty, she did\r\nnot palter with the truth, the being her soul craved to meet was\r\nascending the cliff path and she waited to meet him, without a tremor\r\nor blush or pretence of turning away.\r\n\r\n“It is Marie of Morne Rouge, La Petite Marie,” said the old man (as if\r\nGaspard did not know), “the prettiest _porteuse_ in the island and the\r\nbest girl—but _tenez_, I will shew her to you.”\r\n\r\nThe sun shewed her to him. The sun had taken her little,\r\nperfectly-shaped head between his great golden hands and was raining\r\nkisses on her forehead, her face, her neck, her feet; the sea wind was\r\nfluting and folding her striped robe, which, caught up at the waist,\r\nexposed her perfectly formed ankles; she might have been a Greek girl\r\non the sea cliffs of Latmos, Troy might still have been a city and\r\nHector a living hero, so far removed from present times did she seem.\r\nOnly, no Greek girl could have boasted those eyes dark and luminous,\r\neyes that held in their depths some trace of the gloom of the tropic\r\nforests.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Marie,” cried the old man, “petite Marie—see, I have got a\r\nfriend with me, see, what do you think of him, hey, Marie—? He is the\r\nsnake-killer, the man who does not fear the _fer de lance_, he saved\r\na man yesterday from the _fer de lance_, yes, and that man was Paul\r\nSeguin. Me. Yes, one does not forget that.”\r\n\r\nThe girl was standing, as the old man chattered on, looking up under\r\nher arched eyebrows in a most charming way, half evasively, with a half\r\nsmile; she had met Gaspard with a glance of recognition and now she\r\nstood like this, scarcely looking at him, yet still looking at him,\r\nscarcely seeming to hear the old man, yet hearing him, smiling at his\r\nwords, yet seeming to smile through the veil of some mysterious thought.\r\n\r\nGaspard, fascinated, looked at her; she seemed a being elusive,\r\nscarcely real; as though she had slipped through some crystal doorway\r\nin the air to stand in the blue porch in the sunlight for a moment.\r\nHalf child, half woman, half spirit, half human being—indeterminate as\r\na dream.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thou art pretty—thou art sweet.”\r\n\r\nHe recalled her words spoken to the fleur d’amour.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” went on the old man, “one does not forget that—a live _fer de\r\nlance_ with death on the tip of its tongue, and he killed it with his\r\nnaked hand—give him thy hand. Marie, for the love of Paul Seguin, who\r\nknew thy father when he was prosperous and before he fell into the\r\nhands of that _fer de lance_, Pierre Sagesse.”\r\n\r\nShe came forward like a child and placed her little hand in the broad\r\npalm of Gaspard. Since the day before when she had thanked him with\r\na glance for the flower, she had been filling his thoughts. From the\r\nfirst moment when he met her in the little Place de la Fontaine, she\r\nhad been filling his thoughts; he was direct in love as in hate, a man\r\nwithout any of the false refinement of society, but he was a man and\r\nnow, as he held her hand in his, for the first time in his life he felt\r\nabashed, timorous as a woman, awkward as a boy.\r\n\r\nHe had spoken to her bravely enough on the Place du Fort when he had\r\ngiven her the flower, but now it was different, the touch of her hand,\r\nthe glance of her eyes, filled him with confusion.\r\n\r\nShe, on the other hand, was calm and confident, and had some observer\r\nbeen present, more keen-eyed than M. Seguin to the delicacies of\r\nexpression, he would have read in her face something of triumph.\r\n\r\nHis confusion told her all, told her that she had been in his thoughts,\r\ntold her of his attitude of mind towards her—It was homage without\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nWhen he released her hand M. Seguin took him by the arm and they turned\r\nfrom the sea, Marie walking with them in the direction of M. Seguin’s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIt was a low, frame building, the best house in the town, set round\r\nwith a garden where the tamarinds and the tree ferns all had a bend\r\ntowards the west as though warped by the eternally blowing trade wind.\r\n\r\n“And you are going back to St. Pierre, Marie?” asked the old man when\r\nthey reached the gate.\r\n\r\n“_Oui, Missie._”\r\n\r\n“Walking all the way?”\r\n\r\n“_Oui, Missie._”\r\n\r\n“Well, good luck to thee and a safe journey, ah, that I had thy youth\r\nand strength—”\r\n\r\nHe was turning to the gate when Gaspard, with a half glance at the\r\ngirl, said: “I too, am returning to St. Pierre, would Mademoiselle\r\nobject to my walking with her on the road; it is a lonely road—”\r\n\r\n“You,” said the old man, before Marie could speak. “_Mon Dieu_, do you\r\nthink that you could keep up with a _porteuse_?”\r\n\r\nGaspard glanced at Marie and smiled, shewing his white teeth, the\r\nquestion seemed absurd, contrasting his strong form with the girl’s\r\nslight figure. Marie was also smiling. Their eyes met for a second.\r\n\r\n“I will try—If Mademoiselle does not object to so feeble a companion.”\r\n\r\nM. Seguin laughed, not without a touch of grim humour, but he offered\r\nno further opposition. Instead, he accompanied them to the shop of M.\r\nCarbet where the girl had left her tray.\r\n\r\nM. Carbet, himself, helped to put it on her head and stood with M.\r\nSeguin watching them as they departed.\r\n\r\nIt was a little after two o’clock and the white national road lay\r\nbefore them, balisiers, palmistes, tamarinds on either side and fields\r\nof bending cane. The island before them leaping up to the sky in great\r\nbouquets of happy colour, purple and blue and mauve of mountain,\r\nblack-blues and green of ravine and morne: above all, Pelée, with his\r\nturban of cloud. One might have imagined that some giant in play had\r\nput gum on Pelée’s head and a tuft of cotton wool on the gum.\r\n\r\nIt was the only cloud in the blue sky, and as they walked, some wind,\r\nsuddenly born in the upper air, began to play with it so that it seemed\r\nto fume and rise like smoke.\r\n\r\nIt gave them something to talk about. He found it very difficult\r\nto follow what she said, speaking as she did, in the _patois_ of\r\nthe island and this difficulty in understanding one another gave\r\nthem something to laugh about so that soon they were like two good\r\ncompanions almost forgetting, for a moment, the mysterious attraction\r\nthat had drawn them one towards the other. At times she would seem\r\nto forget him, the old mesmerism of the road would seize her, the\r\nmesmerism of distance and light, the rock-a-bye of movement; she would\r\nhum to herself as though she were alone, once she put words to the\r\ntune, it was an old Creole song, simple, and sorrowful; she only sang\r\na few bars and then remembering that her companion was beside her,\r\nceased. She had not forgotten him for a moment, she was singing to him\r\nin her mind, but she had half forgotten the fact that he was listening\r\nin the flesh.\r\n\r\nShe was happy, entirely happy. He was beside her. She knew nothing more\r\nof love than that, two birds flying forever side by side through the\r\nblue sky, that was her dim conception of love, two beings accompanying\r\neach other through life just as now, he and she were accompanying each\r\nother along the national road, what more could one want?\r\n\r\nThey passed over mornes and through valleys, following the great white\r\nroad; they were cutting canes in the fields and the negroes looked\r\nafter Marie of Morne Rouge accompanied by a man, she had found a mate\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nThey called after her, but what they said was swallowed up, dissolved\r\nin the langourous air of afternoon, it seemed like voices coming across\r\nthe fields of dreamland. A _siffleur de montagne_, singing in the woods\r\nof balisier, sent its bell-like notes to follow them.\r\n\r\nOn the Morne du Midi they paused. The world and the far off sea\r\nswam in a golden haze, the mountains were blue cloud shapes, vague\r\npurple cones; nothing was definite but the peak of Pelée, now stripped\r\nentirely of cloud and standing shrill in the blue. Then they passed on,\r\nfollowing the road as it dipped into the valley and rose again over the\r\nMorne d’Avril.\r\n\r\nIt was now that Gaspard remembered M. Seguin’s words: “You can never\r\nkeep pace with a _porteuse_.” The girl beside him, laden though she was\r\nwith the heavy tray, seemed to move without effort, swift, and silent\r\nas a cloud shadow. He was beginning to tire, but he would not give\r\nin. “_Mon Dieu_,” thought he, “to be outwalked by a girl. I would die\r\nfirst.”\r\n\r\nTo hide his weariness he began to sing. He had a good voice and he\r\nsent _The Girls of Avignon_ across the cane fields, floating on the\r\nwarm wind of afternoon, so that the cane cutters paused in their work\r\nto listen. Marie had never heard a song like that, though she only\r\nhalf-caught the meaning of the words it seemed to open new vistas\r\nbefore her. This was one of the songs from the land he came from,\r\njoyous and strange, far different from the Creole songs that are all\r\nset to the same key—Melancholy.\r\n\r\nHe sang _Jean François de Nantes_, and the topsail-haul chanty of the\r\nFrench merchant service, songs strange as sea gulls amidst these green\r\nmornes and waving cane fields.\r\n\r\nThe sun was well in the west now, casting his light full in their\r\nfaces, their shadows stretched far back along the white road, the\r\nvalleys between the mornes were beginning to fill with shadow, shadow\r\nthat, like some blue luminous fluid, would fill them to the brim,\r\noverflow, and flood the mornes, the fields, and the road.\r\n\r\n“I would sooner die than give in,” that was the real burthen of the\r\nsongs with which he tried to give himself heart, his head ached, his\r\nlimbs ached, he would have given half he possessed to cast himself\r\ndown amidst the green stuff on the roadside—yet she kept on as fresh\r\nas when she started, listening to his songs, chatting, saying things\r\nthat he only half understood, singing, sometimes, herself, when he\r\nceased—what a girl!—it was as though a man had matched himself\r\nagainst an immortal.\r\n\r\nHere and there along the road were shrines to the Virgin and\r\noccasionally a fountain fed by one of the innumerable little streams\r\nfrom the hills.\r\n\r\nThey had passed the Morne de la Croix when, by one of these wayside\r\nfountains, his determination to die before giving in left him. There\r\nwas a green bank by the fountain, huge tree ferns grew above the bank\r\nand in the shadow of their fronds the fountain water, escaping from a\r\nlion’s head carved in stone, sang, and whispered forever to the ferns.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the bank and Marie standing before him, saw for the\r\nfirst time the true state of affairs. She took the little flask of\r\nratifia which the _porteuse_ always carried and a cup from her girdle,\r\nput some of the ratifia in the cup, filled it with water and gave it to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe drank it off. It was like drinking life. Then she pointed to the\r\ntray on her head and asked him to help her to remove it.\r\n\r\nThe _porteuse_, once loaded, cannot remove the heavy tray from her head\r\nwithout help. She dare not bend her neck lest it should be dislocated\r\nby the weight.\r\n\r\nHe rose and helped her, she placed the tray by the road and then sat\r\ndown on the bank beside him. Ah, how good it was to rest in the cool\r\nshadow of the ferns, his tiredness cast from him like a dropped cloak.\r\n\r\nHe almost forgot that the being beside him was a girl. It was as if he\r\nwere sitting beside a good companion after a long journey; after four\r\nhours in the stokehold he had often felt the same, resting for a moment\r\nwith Yves on the engine-room hatch.\r\n\r\nGreat exertion often leaves the mind clear to perception: the passions,\r\ndesires, and craving of life are stilled and over the resting body the\r\nmind floats clear of perception, lazy, alive to feeling, but half dead\r\nto thought.\r\n\r\nHe took his pipe from his pocket—the same pipe he had been smoking\r\nbeneath the palm trees that day when Yves, returning from the north of\r\nthe islet had flung the crabs beside him on the sand—filled it and lit\r\nit, whilst Marie, beside him, her hands folded and resting upon her\r\nknees, sat, her eyes gazing at the road before her yet seeming not to\r\nsee it.\r\n\r\nThese fits of abstraction were characteristic of her, caused perhaps,\r\npartly by her business in life, partly by her nature.\r\n\r\nIt was as though the far off mountains, the blue distances, the visions\r\nof remote sea that made her everyday horizon, followed her through life\r\nand every now and then closed in around her, separating her for the\r\nmoment from her fellow beings.\r\n\r\nShe seemed now to have forgotten the existence of Gaspard, then, a\r\nfield rat from the canes scuttled across the road and the sight of\r\nit brought her back from her reverie, she shuddered, then she gave a\r\nlittle laugh, drew her robe tightly round her, and drew up her little\r\nnaked feet under her robe.\r\n\r\n“Ahn—_voici_ Missie Sagesse—ah, did you see him—more crafty than the\r\n_fer de lance_.” With head half turned she was watching the grass still\r\nvibrating where Missie Sagesse had whisked in.\r\n\r\nGaspard laughed, the great fat field rat—and the West Indian field rat\r\nis the cunningest thing in nature, and looks it—did carry with it a\r\nsuggestion of the Captain.\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten Sagesse, _La Belle Arlésienne_, and the forthcoming\r\nexpedition, for the moment.\r\n\r\n“Sagesse,” said he, “what do you know about Captain Sagesse, little\r\none?”\r\n\r\nShe cast her eyes up and made a movement with her hand. One of the\r\ncharming things about her was the way she could speak without speaking,\r\njust by a gesture, a glance, she could tell things that would take many\r\nwords to say. Her up-cast eyes and the movement she made with her hand\r\ntold the character of the Captain without speech.\r\n\r\nShe nodded towards the long grass where the rat had disappeared: “He\r\nhides amidst the canes, he kills the little birds that cannot yet fly,\r\nhe comes to the henroosts of the poor people and kills the little\r\nchickens—egg-sucker—ahn—of all things the meanest. Once—” said\r\nMarie, leaving description for romance “a _fer de lance_ bit him.”\r\n\r\n“Did he die?”\r\n\r\n“No, it was the _fer de lance_ who died.” She laughed. Voltaire,\r\nsitting in his study at Ferney had once made the same jest about the\r\nman who poisoned the snake. Goldsmith used the same idea with a dog for\r\nthe chief protagonist of his story. She had never heard of Voltaire or\r\nGoldsmith—she just wanted to describe Sagesse.\r\n\r\nThen she rose to her feet and pointed to her shadow strewn away down\r\nthe road, then to the sun nearing the mountain tops. It was time to be\r\ngoing, and Gaspard, rising, helped her to lift the heavy tray to her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAlready it was cooler, the great haze of afternoon light had faded and\r\ndistant things were becoming definite, the sun was fast approaching the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n“You know this Sagesse—” said Gaspard as he walked beside her, “well I\r\nknow him too. I am going with him soon on a voyage.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped and turned, facing him fully. “Going with him—a voyage.”\r\n\r\n“Not far—I will return.”\r\n\r\n“Going with him—ah, you are going with him—”\r\n\r\n“I will return.”\r\n\r\nThe trouble in her face and voice affected him strangely. He did not\r\nknow how Sagesse had entered into her life before this, ruining her\r\nfather, casting a blight on her home. Sagesse was to her like an evil\r\nspirit. She had seen his blight on many people, he had blighted her own\r\nlife once and now his shadow had fallen across her path again, he was\r\ntaking Gaspard away.\r\n\r\nGaspard took her unresisting hand.\r\n\r\n“I have promised to go with him, but I will return.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you have promised—”\r\n\r\nThat was final. With her, a promise once given was binding as a thing\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n“And when?”\r\n\r\n“We will not go for some weeks.”\r\n\r\nHe was still holding her hand; as yet they had said no word of love,\r\nyet they stood like a pair of lovers about to part, her trouble had\r\ncommunicated itself in some subtle way to him. The very air around\r\nthem seemed suddenly filled with sadness, it was the light which was\r\nbeginning to fade.\r\n\r\nThe sun had half descended behind the mountains, cut in two by the\r\nsharp edge of the hills; what remained of him was still furiously\r\nalive, palpitating, and seeming to fight against fate; but the valleys\r\nbetween the mornes were now filled with shadow and over-brimming,\r\ndusk was rising like a tide, waves of violet shadow passing over the\r\nlandscape. Behind them, had they turned to look, they would have seen\r\nthe ghost of a moon in the lilac of the eastern sky.\r\n\r\nSt. Pierre would soon be in the full blaze of sunset, there were miles\r\nstill to be travelled, she gently released her hand, turned, and they\r\npassed on. They did not say a word but in that moment of sadness, hand\r\nin hand, the future of the one had become a part of the future of the\r\nother. He was hers and she was his.\r\n\r\nNever had love come to mortals in a more idyllic fashion, speechless,\r\nthrough the fading light, there on the white road with the straight\r\npalms for only witness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nFLOWER OF LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they passed through Morne Rouge the last rays of sunset were\r\nflaming up the streets of St. Pierre and the light of the moon in her\r\nfirst quarter was beginning to flood the world. They had still some\r\nmiles to go and now their shadow lay before them, dimly sketched on\r\nthe road by the strengthening moonlight. At the approach of night the\r\nair had become filled with sound. The woods were beginning to awake.\r\nThe _cabritt bois_, the great beetles that boom amidst the tamarinds,\r\nthe thousand insects of the night were tuning up, the fireflies were\r\ndrifting in clouds above the grenadilla blossoms and, now, as though a\r\ndoor had been suddenly shut, night filled the world and the stars the\r\nsky. When they reached the turn of the road leading down to St. Pierre\r\nGaspard paused.\r\n\r\nBeneath them lay the city sprayed with lights, the bay touched with\r\nstarlight, and beyond the shadow of the mountains the sea in the light\r\nof the moon.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” said he, “I must meet you again to-morrow—where shall I\r\nmeet you, and when?”\r\n\r\nShe stood for a moment without answering. To-morrow she would have to\r\ngo to Calabasse far away towards Pelée and beyond Morne Rouge. The\r\neternal labour to which Fate had condemned her gave little time for\r\nlovers’ meetings. Not for a moment did she think of breaking with her\r\nwork and taking a holiday; it had become a part of her life; to cease\r\nworking, to give up a day just for her own pleasure never occurred to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said she, at last, “an hour before sunset. I will then have\r\nreturned from Calabasse.”\r\n\r\n“You will surely be here?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\nThe word was less a word than a sigh.\r\n\r\nSurely be there?—nothing but death would stop her from being there,\r\nmornes, and mountains, endless roads to be travelled by her little\r\nfeet, heat of day, or storm, nothing overcomable by human heart and\r\nwill could stop her from being there, and she said it all in that sigh\r\nwhich was half a word.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and held it to his lips for a moment. It was their\r\nfirst kiss. Then side by side they began to descend the steep way to\r\nthe city. It was late for St. Pierre where people went to bed shortly\r\nafter sundown, the moon was just lifting above the mountains and the\r\nsound of the sea came up from the bay, breathing through the empty\r\nstreets and mixing with the rippling and tinkling of the fountains and\r\nwater courses.\r\n\r\nThe Street of the Precipice was filled with moonlight. The old street,\r\nto-night, was Romance itself made visible. The heavy-shuttered houses,\r\nthe coigns of shadow, the causeway of moonlight leading the eye\r\ndownward to the ghost of a silver sea.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the street she turned and gave him her hand. She did\r\nnot wish him to come further, Man’m Charles would be sitting up to let\r\nher in. She had never been so late before and though she felt no qualms\r\nat all at the cause of her lateness she did not wish her aunt to hear\r\nher saying good-bye to Gaspard, that would mean explanations. All that\r\nday, its blueness, its fragrance, its mystery; the sunlight, and the\r\nhills, the distant ocean, the twilight in which her soul had met and\r\ntouched the soul that had come to find her from far across the sea, all\r\nthat seemed like some mysterious flower coloured with the colours of\r\nearth but immortal as the light of the stars.\r\n\r\nFinotte, Florine, Lys, wandering in the fields of youth had plucked\r\nroses, lilies, flowers of a moment. She wandering alone, had found this\r\nflower of light, deathless, and indestructible. Let the world pass, let\r\nthe man she loved betray her, let come what might, her flower would\r\nnever fade.\r\n\r\nHe watched her as she passed away down the Street of the Precipice,\r\nshe, whose grace Theocritus might have sung in the warmth of some\r\nSicilian night, and as he watched her, just for a moment, there came\r\nupon him, untutored as he was, a breath from long ago. It was as though\r\ndoors had been flung open to all the songs, the perfumes, and the\r\nstarlight of all the nights of the past, nights by the Sicilian sea\r\nbefore Taormina had become a desolation, love songs blown across the\r\nroses, roses casting their fragrance to the sea and stars.\r\n\r\nHe saw the little figure, now, away down the street pausing before a\r\nhouse on the right hand side, then it vanished, leaving the Street of\r\nthe Precipice deserted. He turned homewards, walking slowly; it was\r\nstill early as Europeans reckon earliness, yet St. Pierre was already\r\nasleep. In a French town at this hour the cafés would be still blazing,\r\nthe streets filled, theatres not yet empty; but St. Pierre, like a\r\nchild, went to sleep with the dark; hushed by the murmur of the sea\r\nbelow and the woods above, and lit by the fireflies and the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nSIMON SERPENTE\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was awakened from sleep next morning by a voice outside his door.\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of Captain Sagesse. Then a knock came to the door and\r\ninstantly on the knock it opened and the Captain came into the room.\r\n\r\nGaspard had slept late, it was full morning and the light was strong\r\nenough to shew Sagesse’s face and its expression. Something was\r\nevidently the matter. He shut the door and crossed the room.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a pretty thing,” said Sagesse. “I am betrayed, my affair has\r\nbeen blown on—Have you spoken?”\r\n\r\n“Spoken—on what?”\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu!_ What else but the expedition.”\r\n\r\n“I, never—not a word—at least—”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“I said to one man that I was going on a voyage with you, but I said\r\nnothing of the nature of the voyage.”\r\n\r\n“Who was the man you spoke to?”\r\n\r\n“An old gentleman of the name of Seguin.”\r\n\r\n“Hell!” cried Sagesse, springing up from the chair on which he had\r\ntaken his seat. “Seguin. There is only one Seguin on the island—ah,\r\nthat’s where the money is coming from—” He ceased speaking, sat down\r\non the chair again, crushed his panama hat, which he had taken off,\r\nbetween the palms of his hands and stared at the floor with a frown on\r\nhis forehead and his lips pursed up.\r\n\r\nThe evening before, Jules, his first mate and henchman, had brought him\r\nwind of a rumour that was circulating amidst the drinking bars of the\r\nharbour side.\r\n\r\nA rumour that Missie Sagesse had discovered the whereabouts of a wreck\r\nladen with kegs of gold dollars, that he was going to hunt for it, but\r\nwould, most likely, fail as another expedition was starting, financed\r\nby a man much richer and more powerful than the Captain.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing had originated with Jules himself who, in his cups, had\r\ntalked to a coloured woman of the secret which Sagesse had hinted to\r\nhim. The hatred of the harbour side for Sagesse had supplied the other\r\nimaginary expedition.\r\n\r\nIn reality, nothing was known of any importance. Yet Sagesse, with whom\r\nsuspicion was almost a disease, was sure that Gaspard had betrayed him.\r\nThe only thing that made him feel uncertain on the matter was the fact\r\nthat Gaspard was presumably unacquainted with any rich man capable of\r\nworking mischief. And now Gaspard had confessed speaking to Seguin on\r\nthe matter! Seguin, one of the richest men in the island and Sagesse’s\r\ngreatest enemy.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was plain.\r\n\r\nAnother man would have given rein to his temper, accused Gaspard to his\r\nface of the imaginary betrayal, come to blows with him.\r\n\r\nBut that was not the way of Captain Sagesse.\r\n\r\nGaspard was necessary to him as a working partner. If money were found,\r\na white man, single-handed, might have an exceedingly difficult time\r\nwith the black crew of _La Belle Arlésienne_. He had not time to find\r\nanother white man to take Gaspard’s place, simply because now that the\r\nsecret was known, the expedition must start as quickly as possible.\r\nNo, it would be very impolitic to fight with him now, afterwards—ah,\r\nyes, afterwards when the money was salved and safe on board the ship,\r\nwhen he had discovered the temper of the crew under treasure-strain,\r\nthen it would be different. He promised himself some satisfaction then,\r\nand promising himself this he unbent his brows and ceased to purse his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n“After all,” said he, “what does it matter? You say you told nothing\r\nto Paul Seguin. I believe you. All the same, he has got wind of the\r\naffair, he is going to send a man on the same job—”\r\n\r\n“_Tenez_,” said Gaspard, “same job, how can he, when nobody knows about\r\nthe island but you and me?”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Sagesse, “that’s the mystery—how indeed? But he knows it\r\nand that is enough for me. I start in three days’ time.”\r\n\r\n“Three days!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, by working overtime, I’ll have the cargo out of the _Belle_ day\r\nafter to-morrow night—”\r\n\r\n“_Vé_, but you will want time to get your tackle—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _mon Dieu_,” said Sagesse, “Do you think I ever say I’m going to\r\ndo a thing without having my plans ready made? Come with me and you\r\nwill see. We can have breakfast somewhere together and talk everything\r\nover when I have done my business.”\r\n\r\nGaspard got up and dressed and then the two men left the house and\r\nwalked down the Rue du Morne side by side towards the harbour. Often\r\nin his life, Sagesse had been approached on the subject of sunken\r\ntreasure. The Caribbean and the Atlantic about the Bahamas give a fine\r\nfield for theoretical treasure-seekers, locations of sunken ships had\r\nbeen brought to him off Rum Cay, off Grand Cayman, off Matanzas. The\r\nships were there right enough only waiting to be rifled, but Sagesse\r\nwould have nothing to do with them. He had a profound knowledge of the\r\nsea and its trickery. He knew that though the ships were there they\r\nwere tormented by currents, currents that varied with the ebb and flow\r\nso that divers could work only at slack; he knew the power of these\r\ncurrents to heap sand and hide treasure. He had seen the end of a\r\nbroken deep-sea cable brought up, half a mile of it tied in knots by\r\nthe mischievous hands of the currents as though some giant had been\r\nplaying with it.\r\n\r\n“When a treasure ship lies a prey to the currents of the sea, there is\r\nno use in hunting for treasure or for anything but disappointment,” was\r\nan axiom with him.\r\n\r\nWhat led him to the present adventure was the fact that the ship was\r\nlying in a still lagoon in which diving operations could be conducted\r\nas easily as in a lake. She was not sanded up but coralled over, and if\r\nthere was “stuff” in her a few charges of dynamite would soon lay her\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThe morning was bright over the sea when they reached the harbour side,\r\n_La Belle Arlésienne_ was lying out on the blue water, the lighters\r\nbeside her and the cargo coming out to the tune of winch pawls and the\r\nchanty of the negroes—\r\n\r\n    A Fort de France Ay ho!\r\n    A Fort de France Ay ho!\r\n      Bonjou Doux-Doux,\r\n                Ay ho!\r\n    A Fort de France,\r\n    A Fort de France,\r\n                Ay ho!\r\n\r\nTo southward of _La Belle Arlésienne_ a big three-master was\r\ngetting up anchor, a cable ship the _Grappler_ was tramping the bay\r\ntaking soundings. The water sinks to a tremendous depth here between\r\nMartinique and Dominica and from the _Grappler_ away out on the violet\r\nblue of the “deeps” came the faint sewing-machine whirr of the Kelvin\r\nsounder at work.\r\n\r\n_Canotiers_ were paddling their tiny cargoes round the steamer from\r\nNew York that had arrived the evening before and would start at noon;\r\none could see the little _canotiers,_ lemon-coloured slips of children\r\nstanding up and diving for coins flung by the passengers.\r\n\r\nIt was a picture full of the spirit of morning, full of colour, and\r\nlight, and movement, the hot wind of the tropics stirring flags and\r\nshaking out sail-cloth; sea gulls were fishing, flickering snow-white\r\nin the wind, their querulous cries came across the bay with the clank\r\nof the winch pawls, capstan pawls, and anchor-chain, and the endless\r\nchanty—\r\n\r\n    A Fort de France Ay ho!\r\n    A Fort de France Ay ho!\r\n      Bonjou Doux-Doux,\r\n                Ay ho!\r\n    A Fort de France,\r\n    A Fort de France,\r\n                Ay ho!\r\n\r\nFaint, musical with distance.\r\n\r\nSagesse, leading the way, they passed along the shore edge to the Place\r\nBertine.\r\n\r\nThe sunlight was just striking the Place Bertine over the shoulder of\r\nPelée. In the blaze of morning light with the sea and wind shaking\r\nthe tamarind trees, it formed a bright picture; women’s coloured\r\ndresses, turbans of yellow madras, men, some clad in white, some half\r\nnaked, rolling the sugar hogsheads, laughing, and singing as they\r\nworked, all coloured men, from the white Creole to the jet-black negro;\r\nchildren—and you may be sure that wherever there is sugar either in\r\ncane or barrel you will find children—playing games, running messages;\r\nchildren black as sloes, yellow as bananas, honey-coloured babies\r\nnaked as on the day they were born; over all the warm tropic wind\r\nblowing lazily, mixing the scent of the sea with the perfume of the\r\nland, cigar scent—for even the women are smoking the black Martinique\r\n_bouts_,—and the subtle ubiquitous scent of sugar in bulk.\r\n\r\nSagesse led the way across the Place to the row of warehouses and\r\ngo-downs bordering it on the shore edge. He paused at an archway giving\r\nentrance to a big twilit warehouse, peeped into the gloom of the place\r\nas if in search of someone or something, and then entered followed by\r\nGaspard.\r\n\r\nIt was an extraordinary warehouse, this, smelling of tar, sail-cloth,\r\nand rope. Piles of rusty chain, cable, old anchors, capstan bars, spars\r\nof all sorts, blocks of all sizes lay about, and in the gloom, ropes\r\nand remnants of tackle hanging from the beams overhead gave a last\r\ntouch to the picture. One might have fancied it a cave in which a ship\r\nhad come to wreck, or several ships for the matter of that.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all the rubbish and odds and ends, the owner of the\r\nplace, Monsieur Jaques, known as Jaques _tout court_ by shipmasters\r\nfrom Port of Spain to Port Royal, moved about superintending three\r\nmen who were engaged with palm and needle patching a sail spread on a\r\nvacant space of the floor.\r\n\r\nThere are some men who, vulture-like, make their living out of the\r\nruin and dead bones of things, only in that way do they prosper,\r\nJaques was one of these men, though you would never have guessed his\r\nvulturous instincts from his appearance which was that of a plump\r\nprosperous-looking business man, rather past the prime of life,\r\ngrey-headed, clean-shaven, always smiling, always calm, always polite,\r\nalways seeming to yield to your wishes—but iron in driving a bargain.\r\n\r\nHis business in life was the buying up of old ships and odds and ends\r\nof ships for next to nothing, and selling the remains at a profit. If\r\nyou wanted an anchor or a suit of sails or a spar, he could always\r\nsupply you. He would buy wrecks even when they were sunken—that is\r\nto say, of course, if they were lying in shallow water. He had bought\r\nin this way the _Amine-Martell_, lying on the thunderous beach to\r\nwestward of Grande Anse. The bay in which she was lying was a death\r\ntrap inaccessible from the sea or from the land, the cliffs were sheer\r\nwalls of black rock polished and flawless; by lowering men over the\r\ncliff edge by ropes he had salved thirty-five thousand dollars in gold\r\ncoin—a profitable business considering the fact that he had paid only\r\ntwo thousand dollars for her as she lay.\r\n\r\nFrom Curaçoa to Porto Rico he had conducted salvage operations,\r\nfighting the sea for the pickings of ships, conducting the operations\r\nin person when there seemed a chance of good profits on the job.\r\n\r\nSagesse took Monsieur Jaques aside and explained what he wanted whilst\r\nGaspard sat on a spar-end and watched the sail-patchers at work.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got some diving work on hand,” said Sagesse. “I want two divers’\r\nsuits, a pump, everything complete. Have you them, and how much will\r\nyou charge to hire them for two months?”\r\n\r\n“Two thousand dollars deposit and five hundred for the hire,” replied\r\nJaques without a moment’s hesitation.\r\n\r\n“Three hundred and not a cent more.”\r\n\r\n“My price is five hundred—and if you don’t like it I am sorry. I\r\nhave already been approached by a gentleman on the same subject. I am\r\nexpecting him here any moment, if he concludes the bargain with me,\r\nwhere else will you get diving apparatus—not in Martinique.”\r\n\r\nThis of course was a lie, but the mind of Sagesse, fogged with\r\nsuspicion, saw in it a confirmation of the rumour that another\r\nexpedition was on foot. Jaques, watchful as a bird of prey, saw the\r\neffect of his words without understanding entirely the reason.\r\n\r\n“Who is this other person, then,” said Sagesse. “You can at least tell\r\nme his name.”\r\n\r\n“I never give names in business, Captain, but as you have been my\r\ncustomer up to this, I will whisper something in your ear.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jaques, lowering his voice, “I expect he is a gentleman on\r\nthe same business as yourself.”\r\n\r\n“The Devil!” said Sagesse. Then, recollecting himself, he laughed.\r\n\r\n“If he is, he’s on a business that won’t bring him much profit—well, I\r\ncan’t waste any more time, let’s see the suits and the apparatus.”\r\n\r\nJaques led the way through a door to the back premises, where in a shed\r\nwere the diving suits, the pump, the air tubes, all nearly new and in\r\ngood working order. The pump was constructed so that it could be fixed\r\nin a boat or be used from on board ship. _La Belle Arlésienne_ had\r\na boat that would do for the work to a nicety, she would have to be\r\nhauled across the islet and floated in the lagoon. The busy mind of\r\nthe captain was arranging all these details as he examined the gear.\r\nThen, turning to Jaques:\r\n\r\n“Three hundred for the hire and not a cent more.”\r\n\r\n“Five hundred and not a cent less. Why should I let you have a thing\r\nfor three hundred which I can hire out to someone else for five—that\r\nis not business.”\r\n\r\n“Four hundred, come, the money down and the deposit.”\r\n\r\n“Five hundred and not a cent less.”\r\n\r\n“Four-fifty.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I defraud myself of fifty dollars.”\r\n\r\n“Well, five hundred be it.”\r\n\r\n“And of course, M. le Capitaine, you will be responsible for any injury\r\nto the apparatus.”\r\n\r\n“There will be no injury—and now that we have concluded business, I’ll\r\ntell you the name of the man who wanted to cut me out—who wanted to\r\nhire these things.”\r\n\r\nJaques, pleased with the bargain he had struck, delighted with the\r\nsuccess of his ruse, and more delighted with the fact that it was\r\nthe wily Captain Sagesse who had fallen a victim to his bluff, said\r\nnothing, but smiled.\r\n\r\n“Shall I tell you?”\r\n\r\n“If it pleases you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was Paul Seguin—am I not right?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say—I never tell secrets of business.”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said Sagesse. “I want this matter put right. You and I\r\nhave known each other for years. I want the information because I\r\nbelieve I have been betrayed on some business I have in hand. See here,\r\nif you whisper the name of the man who came to you about those diving\r\nsuits, I’ll never tell, but I’ll be sure in my mind and on my guard,\r\nand I’ll pay you five dollars for the information.”\r\n\r\nHe took the money from his pocket as he spoke. “You’ll not tell—it\r\nwill be kept entirely between ourselves?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I promise.”\r\n\r\n“Then give me your ear.” Jaques approached his head close to the\r\nother’s and in a low voice said:\r\n\r\n“Paul Seguin.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” said Sagesse, handing over the money which Monsieur Jaques\r\npocketed. Five dollars for just a lie was the best bargain he had ever\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAs Sagesse came through the warehouse, he found Gaspard still seated on\r\nthe spar end watching the sail-patchers at their work. He could have\r\nshot him with all the pleasure in life, yet he greeted him cheerily and\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\nIt is a profound popular mistake to attribute no sense of honour to a\r\nscoundrel.\r\n\r\nHe has the keenest sense of honour—in others. He feels when he is\r\nbetrayed just as an honourable man feels only, perhaps, more acutely.\r\n\r\n“And now that we have finished business,” said Jaques, “will you\r\nnot take some refreshment, you and your friend?” He opened a door\r\nleading from the warehouse to a room, half sitting-room, half office,\r\nushered them in, and opening another door, called for coffee, rum, and\r\ncigarettes.\r\n\r\nIn a moment, a servant, bearing a huge tray spread with the ordinary\r\nMartinique _petit déjeuner_, entered. Gaspard scarcely heard the\r\nentrance of the servant, he was examining a picture hanging on the pine\r\nboarding of the wall, a small, old-fashioned wood-engraving that had\r\nstruck his eye immediately he entered and now held him fascinated as\r\nthe serpent on the Place du Fort had held old M. Seguin.\r\n\r\nIt represented a man small and hideous, holding in one hand an immense\r\nsword and in the other hand a whip.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed in a shirt and loose trousers, a broad sash was round\r\nhis waist and from the sash peeped the butt of a pistol.\r\n\r\nThe thing was horrible and grotesque. The man’s head and face were\r\nscarcely larger than the head and face of a child; yet the face had in\r\nit the ferocity of a demon; it was of extraordinary breadth across the\r\ncheek bones.\r\n\r\nThe limbs, as far as the clothing allowed them to be seen, were\r\ndeformed, and as Gaspard stood fascinated and repelled, a shiver\r\nran through him. He had seen this man—this thing—before—where?\r\nImpossible to say; in some past life, in some dream—glimpsed, perhaps,\r\nin the midst of some crowd, through the fumes of tobacco in some\r\nbar—somewhere, at some time in his life, he had seen that hideous head.\r\n\r\nMore, he felt that the creature, half man, half demon, had entered his\r\nlife once, bringing evil into it. Yet, wildly searching his memory, he\r\ncould remember nothing of the circumstance.\r\n\r\n“Coffee or cognac?”\r\n\r\nMonsieur Jaques was speaking and Gaspard turned from the picture and\r\naccepting a cup of coffee and a cigarette, took his seat at the table\r\nwith the others.\r\n\r\nJaques, a cigar in his mouth and a cup of coffee before him, was deep\r\nin trade talk with Sagesse and Gaspard, pretending interest in their\r\nconversation, but hearing nothing, gazed round the room, taking in its\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThe walls were decorated with drawings of ships, Carib paddles, gourds,\r\na glass case containing beetles and tarantulas, things of sea and land,\r\nbut mostly of the sea.\r\n\r\nHere was a chart of the Yucatan Straits marked in ink with the\r\nsoundings of a wreck; beside it a chart of the waters just westward of\r\nNassau where lies a great pond of the sea nearly two hundred miles from\r\nnorth to south surrounded with shoal water and reefs, this chart was\r\nmarked, too, with the position of a wreck. A battle-lantern that might\r\nhave lit Van Horne on some night expedition, hung from a staple near\r\nthe charts, Jaques had picked it up in the sands near San Juan; an old\r\ncuraçoa flask with a leathern handle, the earliest form of the bottle\r\nin which the Dutch exported their liqueur, hung by the lantern. The\r\nhistory of the Caribbean and the Spanish Main lay here in these things\r\nand many more, but let his eyes rove as they might, Gaspard could not\r\nstop them from returning to the picture that had fascinated him.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of a pause in the conversation between Jaques and\r\nSagesse, Gaspard leaned forward:\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, monsieur,” said he, pointing to the picture, “but you have\r\na strange portrait on your wall, and the strangest thing about it is\r\nthat I feel I have seen the gentleman before.”\r\n\r\nJaques looked at the picture and laughed. “_Ma foi_,” said he, “if\r\nyou have seen him alive you are older than I am. You have most likely\r\nseen him in a print, but not such a good print as that one, it is by\r\nCoullier, very old, and I picked it up for a song.”\r\n\r\n“And the name of the man?”\r\n\r\n“It is Simon Serpente.”\r\n\r\n“Who was he?”\r\n\r\n“What! you have never heard of Simon Serpente—ah, but I forgot, you\r\nare, no doubt, fresh to the West Indies. Well, monsieur, Simon Serpente\r\nwas a devil—He was a man all the same—”\r\n\r\nHere Sagesse nodded as though he knew all about Simon Serpente.\r\n\r\n“But,” continued Jaques, “he was all the same a devil. We have had a\r\ngood many devils in these parts in the old days, but Simon out-Heroded\r\nthem all. He was one of the last of the pirates and the worst. Kidd,\r\nHorne, Singleton were not so bad as him. What do you say, Monsieur le\r\nCapitaine?”\r\n\r\n“O, from all accounts he was a tough man,” said Sagesse. “I’ve never\r\nheld with these cut-throat scoundrels, if they’d lived in my day I’d\r\nhave rooted them out if I’d been in power. The government could have\r\ndone it then, only they were bribed. Don’t tell me, the governors in\r\nthose days grew fat on pirates.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” said Jaques, “and Serpente kept his head out of the\r\nnoose more than once by gilding it, all the same, Serpente was feared\r\nfor himself, they said he was not a man, they said that no one could\r\nkill him and that when he departed this life he would have to die by\r\nhis own hand, people imagined that he brought bad luck to anyone who\r\ncrossed his path or at whom he looked crookedly.”\r\n\r\n“All that is women’s talk,” said Sagesse, “there is no such thing as\r\nbad luck—or devil for the matter of that—go on.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jaques, “if there is no such thing as bad luck, at all\r\nevents, Serpente did not bring good luck and he got such a name for\r\nbeing the Devil himself that he made men frightened of him, even the\r\nfellows of his own stamp.\r\n\r\n“He’d been pirating for years and he’d made a very large fortune, no\r\none knew where he had hidden it, wind got about that he had an island\r\nof his own somewhere in the Caribbean but no one ever tried to find it,\r\nfor, I tell you quite plainly, that had his treasure been lying on the\r\nbeach down there, people would have let it lie—”\r\n\r\n“Fools,” said Sagesse.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so, but, all the same, I doubt if I would have cared to meddle\r\nwith it myself. People said it was the Devil’s treasure and that it\r\nwas well-guarded—I am not so sure that they were fools either. I\r\nknow Monsieur le Capitaine, you are sceptical on these points, but\r\nI have seen bad effects following upon money got by force and blood\r\nand inherited. Anyhow, the money of Simon Serpente I would not have\r\ntouched. Dieu! the things that man was credited with I would not speak\r\nof, even before you, and so he went through life till all at once he\r\ngave up pirating. It was a most extraordinary ending to his piracy\r\ntoo, for he fell foul of Laropé off Matanzas. Laropé, you must know,\r\nwas a brother pirate, his ship was the _Golden-Shell_, Serpente’s ship\r\nwas the _Puerto Mexico_, both ships had been chasing a brigantine when\r\nSerpente signalled Laropé to haul off, that the prize was his, as he\r\nhad sighted it first; Laropé refused, and the next thing he knew, was\r\nthat his maintop mast had been shot away.\r\n\r\n“Then, forgetting the brigantine, the two pirates closed. It was off\r\nMatanzas and the shore was crowded with people watching, they said\r\nthat the guns could be heard at Havana, the wind being from the east.\r\nThe upshot was that Serpente laid the _Puerto Mexico_ alongside the\r\n_Golden-Shell_, boarded her, put every man to death _and hanged Laropé\r\nfrom his own main yard for a pirate_.\r\n\r\n“Then Serpente, leaving the _Golden-Shell_ to float derelict, sailed\r\naway in the direction of Cape Sable. He never hoisted the black flag\r\nagain and the next thing we hear about him is that he turned his ship\r\ninto a slaver. Turned respectable, so to speak.\r\n\r\n“Men no longer feared him so much now. They said that if he was really\r\na devil he would not have turned over a new leaf. They began to\r\nremember his crimes and a movement was set on foot against him.\r\n\r\n“He heard this, but he did not seem to mind, putting it down most\r\nlikely, to idle talk, till one day definite news came to him as he was\r\nleaving the American coast with a cargo of slaves that a corvette was\r\nout against him and that when he was caught he would be hanged.\r\n\r\n“Surely enough, two days out from port, he sighted a corvette and she\r\nchased him. The _Puerto Mexico_ could give heels to anything in those\r\nwaters, and by sundown the corvette was only showing her topsails above\r\nthe horizon and by next dawn she was gone; but Serpente knew that all\r\nwas over with him in these seas. The Devil had branded him with such\r\na face and form that he could not hope to hide himself, so he perhaps\r\nmade sail for that island of his where he had placed his treasure—at\r\nall events he was never seen again.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, _Mon Dieu!_” suddenly cried Gaspard. He rose to his feet and went\r\nover to the picture on the wall.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden it had flashed upon him where he had seen the frame-work of\r\nthat face, that contorted form—the hideous skull on the island, the\r\nbones, could they have been the remains of Simon Serpente?\r\n\r\nThe thing seemed madly improbable, till across his mind flashed the\r\nvision of the pouch and belt, with the initials S. S. on the buckle.\r\n\r\nThen he felt, on a sudden, physically ill.\r\n\r\nThe hideous demon of the picture had, then, entered into his life, he\r\ncould not doubt that the skeleton was that of Serpente and that the\r\nmoney in the belt was that of Serpente.\r\n\r\nAnd he had warred with Yves over that money and he had killed Yves.\r\nFor a moment he saw Evil in all its horror and the tenacious clutch\r\nwhich Evil has upon life. To look at this hideous monkey-man was bad\r\nenough, but to feel that you were his inheritor, and that, quarrelling\r\nover this inheritance, you had killed your friend, was beyond words\r\nshocking.\r\n\r\nIt is so seldom that God gives us an objective view of evil, that the\r\nsight when it comes is prodigious and soul-shaking.\r\n\r\nGaspard looked at the picture of the man whose money had soiled his\r\nhands. This man, dead long years ago, Anisette, living, but thousands\r\nof miles away, these two were of the same brand, belonged to the\r\ncompany of evil, they could touch nothing without tainting it and\r\nbetraying it to evil, just as they had tainted Gaspard and betrayed him\r\ninto the hands of Sagesse.\r\n\r\nControlling his emotion, he turned again to the table from which\r\nSagesse was now rising to go.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Jaques accompanied them through the storehouse, bade them\r\ngood-bye, and next moment they were in the brilliant sunshine of the\r\nPlace Bertine, Sagesse leading the way to the water’s edge.\r\n\r\n“I am going on board to see how things are getting on,” said he, “you\r\nhad better come with me and help. We can have something to eat aboard\r\nand you will want to overhaul your cabin—Hi there, bring your boat\r\nalong here!”\r\n\r\nHe called to a longshoreman—a negro, black, and fantastic as a\r\ngolliwog—who was paddling his boat along the shore edge, the man\r\nbrought the boat up as directed and they stepped in.\r\n\r\nThe morning had become utterly windless, and the sea like a mirror.\r\nAway out towards Dominica, a becalmed, inter-island schooner lay\r\nhelpless, the snow-white sails casting a mile-long reflection on the\r\nwater, the three-master which had been getting her anchor up had\r\nscarcely filled her sails when the calm fell, striking the life out of\r\nher. St. Pierre, coloured houses and motionless palms, stood fronting\r\nthe blue, and passionately burning sea. It was the scenery of a most\r\nvivid dream, such infinities of colour and light and silence cast on\r\nthe mind the unreality of mirage. The very sounds from the city and the\r\nshipping in the bay were dream sounds, voices of visionary sailors,\r\nmurmurs from lotus-land.\r\n\r\nEven the old _Belle Arlésienne_, that hag of the ocean, was touched by\r\nthe magic of the day. Masts and spars and rigging, sun-blistered sides,\r\nall were reflected in the mirror of the harbour whilst her copper\r\nshewed up through the emerald-tinted shadows of the water; and the\r\nsouthern weeds and strips of fuci growing from the copper waved as if\r\nblown by a faint wind.\r\n\r\nThe cargo was coming out as fast as winches worked by hand could lift\r\nit, Jules was overseeing the work and he cast down the ladder for them\r\nto come on board. Sagesse when he reached the deck, looked around to\r\nsee how things were going, then he entered the deck-house followed by\r\nGaspard.\r\n\r\n“You’ll take the same cabin,” said Sagesse, pointing to the dog hole on\r\nthe starboard side, “I’ll tell Jules to get one of the niggers to clear\r\nit out for you, there’s a lot of old truck there that wants shifting\r\nand it will give you more room, you won’t have much gear to bring on\r\nboard, I expect.”\r\n\r\n“Not much—you say you are starting in three days, to-day is Tuesday—”\r\n\r\n“I start on Friday.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, on Friday—well, it seems to me that is not a very good day\r\nto start on.”\r\n\r\n“_Cordieu!_” cried Sagesse, suddenly shewing irritation, “what sort of\r\nold woman’s talk is that. What is wrong with Friday?”\r\n\r\nGaspard leaned against a bulkhead with his arms folded, he had scarcely\r\nspoken a word since leaving Jaques’ store and Sagesse had noticed his\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“I do not know what is wrong with Friday, but I do know that with a\r\nwhole week to choose from, I would choose some other day, especially\r\nstarting on an expedition of this sort. However, you can choose what\r\nday you like. I have only one question to ask you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Will you release me from the business and get someone else to take my\r\nplace?”\r\n\r\nSagesse rapped out a laugh, took his seat at the table, folded his arms\r\nand, leaning over his folded arms, stared at his companion.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak for a moment. He seemed trying to read Gaspard’s\r\ninnermost thoughts. Then “No,” he cried, “a hundred times no, you are\r\npart of the business, you gave your word, and now you want to back\r\nout—I find this morning my plans betrayed to this cursed Seguin. I say\r\nnothing about that; but this I say, you come with me or I will take you\r\nalong with a member of La Garde Royale, we will hunt for the remains\r\nof a gentleman who was killed—we will look for his clothing and his\r\nbones. We will—” Sagesse stopped as Gaspard, leaving the bulkhead,\r\ntook a seat at the table right opposite to him.\r\n\r\n“You will do a lot,” said Gaspard, “if I take you by the throat and\r\ndrag you out on deck and fling you into the harbour like the carrion\r\nyou are. I have given you my word to go with you, on your cursed\r\nexpedition, and go I will. Let no more be said. You talk of hunting for\r\nbones, you will find them. Skeleton Island ought to be the name of that\r\nplace and if you don’t leave your own skeleton there you will be lucky.”\r\n\r\n“Threats!” cried Sagesse, making as if to rise from the table.\r\n\r\n“Threats—I never threaten and I am not threatening you now. I say you\r\nwill be lucky if you don’t leave your bones behind you for the place\r\nis cursed—see you here—”\r\n\r\nHe leaned across the table facing Sagesse, and, lowering his\r\nvoice—“See you here, I told you how I fought with a man out there and\r\nhow, by accident, I killed him; well, I did not tell you all—after he\r\nwas dead things happened.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Even before he was dead I did not like the place, that ship down in\r\nthe water seemed to me the devil’s own ship, no one ever saw a ship\r\nlike that before, she was like an old drowning corpse and then all of\r\na sudden just at sundown, she came to life, lit up as though she were\r\nhung with lamps—”\r\n\r\n“Phosphorus,” said Sagesse.\r\n\r\n“It was not, it was just the light in the sky, God’s good sunlight,\r\nbut I have never seen such a thing before. Well, what happened next\r\nday? I killed my friend, I flung my knife at him, but I did not mean to\r\nkill, no, but the devil who lives on that island, took care that the\r\nknife did its work. Next day, as I was standing on the reef, looking\r\nout for ships, I felt someone standing behind me. There was no one to\r\nbe seen but there was someone there, the very gulls in that place are\r\nnot right, _Bon Dieu_, they shout at one—then, in the night someone\r\nbeat a drum close to my tent—I nearly left my reason behind in that\r\nplace—well, now, listen, I escaped, I said to myself, ‘never will I go\r\nback there,’ look at my luck. I meet you. I take too much rum, I talk\r\nto you and shew you that cursed gold, and what’s the result? Well, I’m\r\ngoing back, against my will—”\r\n\r\n“To make your fortune against your will,” said Sagesse with a sneer,\r\n“and you call that bad luck.”\r\n\r\n“Fortune,” cried Gaspard, echoing the sneering tone of the other, “and\r\nyou expect to take a fortune from that place?”\r\n\r\n“If it is there, I will take it.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you if it were lying on the beach, you will not take it.”\r\n\r\n“And who will prevent me?”\r\n\r\n“There is one there who will prevent you.”\r\n\r\n“And who is he?”\r\n\r\n“Simon Serpente.”\r\n\r\nSagesse looked at his companion as if doubting his reason.\r\n\r\n“Simon Serpente.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in the last few hours I have discovered whose ship that is lying\r\nthere in the water, and whose money that was we found in the belt. I\r\ntold you there was a skeleton by the money; well, see here, the skull\r\nwasn’t bigger than that.” He held his hands together as if clasping\r\nlightly the head of a child, “and it was not a right skull, why, I said\r\nto Yves, ‘Well, he must have been a beauty, the fellow this belonged\r\nto,’ then the bones were not the bones of an ordinary man, the minute\r\nI set eyes on that picture of Serpente, I said to myself, ‘I have seen\r\nthat thing before, but where?’ It wasn’t till Monsieur Jaques told\r\nme his story, that I recognised the truth of the thing and that the\r\nskeleton was the skeleton of Serpente.”\r\n\r\n“Rubbish,” replied Sagesse, “you are full up of fo’csle fancies;\r\nSerpente—I don’t believe myself a quarter I have heard about the\r\nchap—you talk like some old Creole woman. If Serpente ever lived, he\r\ndied in some grog shop, like the rest of his sort, filled with balloon\r\njuice; or got knocked on the head in some fight down a back alley—”\r\n\r\n“One moment—I shewed you the belt and the pouch which I brought from\r\nthe island; on the buckle of the belt two letters were scratched, you\r\nexamined them yourself—what were they?”\r\n\r\nSagesse started in his chair. He had cast his memory back.\r\n\r\n“_Cordieu!_” cried he, “I remember now.”\r\n\r\n“What were the letters?”\r\n\r\n“By my faith, it’s strange, S. S. It would be the fellow’s initials.”\r\n\r\n“Just so.”\r\n\r\n“Simon Serpente.”\r\n\r\n“Just so.”\r\n\r\n“You did not scratch those letters yourself?”\r\n\r\nGaspard laughed.\r\n\r\n“Did I know at that time anything about Serpente?”\r\n\r\n“That is true.”\r\n\r\nSagesse’s face had flushed, he sat with his fingers drumming on the\r\ntable and his eyes fixed on his fingers.\r\n\r\nHe seemed plunged in reverie of an exciting nature, then, suddenly\r\nrecovering himself, he brought his great fist down with a bang on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n“That’s luck—one can’t doubt—He went to his hive—He’d have been\r\nmaking for Europe, something happened to his ship and sunk it, who\r\nknows what, but one may swear that he left his bones close to his\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\nThen to Gaspard: “Can’t you see?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“The gold, it’s there as sure as I am here.”\r\n\r\n“I am certain of that.”\r\n\r\n“Then what are you grumbling about, _Mordieu_, you look as though you\r\nhad lost a fortune instead of having found one.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it would be better to lose a fortune than find one like that.\r\nHave it as you will, though, but at least remember my words if anything\r\nshould happen.”\r\n\r\n“And what may they be, those words of yours?” asked Sagesse rising,\r\ngoing to the locker, and pouring himself out a dram.\r\n\r\n“Just this, there’s a curse on that place as sure as my name is Gaspard\r\nCadillac, and the man who goes hunting there for treasure will find\r\nmore than he expects.”\r\n\r\nSagesse drank off his dram.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nSKELETON ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Gaspard came on deck. He had spoken his mind and he felt easier.\r\nHe had tried to dissuade Sagesse from disturbing this resting-place of\r\nbones and possible treasure, Sagesse would not be dissuaded, all the\r\nsame Gaspard felt easier. He had, in plain English, a holy terror of\r\nSimon Serpente. His sufferings on the island, his ill-luck in killing\r\nYves and betraying himself to Sagesse, the horrible personality of\r\nSerpente and the fact that he had seen and handled his bones just\r\nbefore the tragedy of Yves, all these things combined with superstition\r\nto make this monster-man, dead long years ago, a living, and vital\r\npersonality to Gaspard. He feared him a great deal more than he feared\r\nthe devil. He was not sure at all that the devil had existence or power\r\nover man, but he was sure that Serpente had acted as an excellent\r\nsubstitute for the devil in life and that in death he was still harmful.\r\n\r\nFor Gaspard the _Ka_ of Simon Serpente existed on that island, guarding\r\nthe bones it had once surrounded and the treasure it had once amassed;\r\nin trying to dissuade Sagesse from the expedition, he felt he had\r\npropitiated this _Ka_, the wrath of the thing he fancied would fall\r\non Sagesse, and as he leaned on the bulwark rail thinking over the\r\nsituation and the forthcoming expedition, an unholy curiosity awoke in\r\nhis mind as to the upshot of the affair.\r\n\r\nI doubt if he would have drawn back from it now, even if he could;\r\ncuriosity, whose hold upon the superstitious mind is profound, had him\r\nin her grip.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said Curiosity, “I will show you something strange.”\r\n\r\nAs he gazed across the blue water of the harbour at the coloured town,\r\nthe palms, the high woods, leaping green against the blue sky, he\r\nremembered Marie. Simon Serpente had driven her for a moment from his\r\nmind. He was to meet her this evening, two hours before sunset, on the\r\nroad to Morne Rouge.\r\n\r\nContrasted with his gloomy thoughts, how bright seemed that faithful\r\nfigure, contrasted with the demon picture of Serpente, how lovely was\r\nthis form! From where he stood he could see, or thought he could see,\r\nthe beginning of the road to Morne Rouge, up there where the houses\r\nfell away and the palms took the place of buildings.\r\n\r\nHis heart leaped to the spot.\r\n\r\nAs he was leaning on the rail and looking, Sagesse came out of the\r\ndeck-house. The negroes at work on the cargo had knocked off for a\r\nspell, boats had come alongside with the wives of the stevedores,\r\nbringing their food; each woman had with her a basket covered with a\r\nwhite cloth and each basket was divided into compartments containing\r\nfruit, fish—generally _sádines_—and bread.\r\n\r\nAs the men chattered with their wives, Sagesse and Gaspard went round\r\nthe decks; the cargo was half out; it was a very light cargo and it\r\nwas easy to see that _La Belle Arlésienne_ would be clear of it and\r\nin ballast by Friday morning. Having satisfied himself on this point,\r\nGaspard went to the little cabin that had been allotted to him and\r\nbegan turning out the rubbish with which it was encumbered, old bottles\r\nand cigar boxes, bundles of old newspapers, all sorts of useless\r\nraffle; when the place was clear, _déjeuner_ was ready, corossoles,\r\nchicken and rice, fruit, and the inevitable rum. The negro cook placed\r\nthe things on the table and retired.\r\n\r\nSagesse was cheerful during the meal, even friendly; never would you\r\nhave thought that this man had only a short time ago held out threats\r\nagainst his table companion. I doubt, even, if his cheerfulness was\r\nassumed or his friendliness false; he had the art, almost a horrible\r\nart, of packing away in his mind ill feeling, distrust, suspicion,\r\nagainst a man, keeping them cool and fresh till they were wanted. He\r\nwas almost certain that Gaspard had betrayed the secret of the island\r\nto Seguin, but he shewed nothing of it in his manner, felt, perhaps,\r\nnothing of it in his mind, as he enjoyed the excellent food before him\r\nand talked of trade, of the cargo, of the customs—and the hundred and\r\none things that are bound up with trade, the tropics, and the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter _déjeuner_, Gaspard lit a pipe and lay down in his cabin for a\r\nsiesta; he kept the door open for coolness and he could see out beyond\r\nthe cave-like twilight of the deck-house a glimpse of the sun-smitten\r\ndeck; then he fell asleep, and when he awoke it was three o’clock.\r\n\r\nHe turned out of the bunk and came on deck. The winches were still\r\ngoing; Sagesse was nowhere to be seen; Jules, who was superintending\r\nthe unloading of the cargo, said that Missie Sagesse had gone ashore an\r\nhour ago.\r\n\r\nHe was very friendly, Jules, and anxious to please, and leaving the\r\nhands to look after themselves for a moment, he called a shore boat\r\nthat was hanging about the ship and with his own hands dropped the rope\r\nladder for Gaspard.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the boat had landed Gaspard at the harbour steps; he\r\npaid the man, and taking his way up the Passage Bartine, made for the\r\nRue Victor Hugo. He did not know that one of the boatmen was following\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the Rue Victor Hugo he met M. Seguin, who had just\r\nreturned from Grand Anse; it was one of those accidental meetings that\r\nFate arranges. M. Seguin shook hands with his preserver, then, taking\r\nhim by the arm, led him across the way to the Café Palmiste.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the news was brought to Sagesse that Gaspard had met M.\r\nSeguin, evidently by appointment, in the Rue Victor Hugo, and that both\r\nmen had entered a café.\r\n\r\nThis confirmation of his suspicions was the only thing wanted to fix in\r\nSagesse’s mind the certainty that he was betrayed.\r\n\r\nHe had no fear of Seguin stealing a march on him, for _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_ would be away long before Seguin could commission a ship.\r\n\r\nBut he swore a frightful oath to be even with Gaspard when the moment\r\narrived—and the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE GARDEN OF LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Gaspard, “I must be going.”\r\n\r\nHe had been for half an hour in the Café Palmiste opposite M. Seguin, a\r\ncup of coffee, and a box of cigars.\r\n\r\nHe rose from the table and his companion rose also, accompanying him to\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you have business, I will not detain you—so you start on\r\nFriday? I may see you before you go, anyhow, remember Paul Seguin, who\r\nis always your friend, and be careful with that shark of a Sagesse—you\r\nsay you will be back in a few months’ time, well, when you come back,\r\ncome right over to Grand Anse and we will arrange a future for you, you\r\nmust not leave the island, you will marry and settle here; I will find\r\nyou a home and work, not at St. Pierre, but over at Grande Anse where\r\nit is cool and where the trade wind is always blowing.”\r\n\r\nThey shook hands and M. Seguin returned to his coffee and his eternal\r\ncigars, whilst Gaspard struck up town, taking the Rue Carcenet which\r\nwas the nearest way to his destination.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later he was at the commencement of the road to Morne\r\nRouge, at the exact spot where on the evening before, he had stood with\r\nMarie looking down at the lights of St. Pierre.\r\n\r\nHe was before his time; the sun would not reach the horizon for two\r\nhours and a half, and leaning on the old, moss-grown, lizard-haunted\r\nwall that protected the road to seaward, he looked down at the city,\r\nthe harbour and the bay.\r\n\r\nIt was that beneficial moment of the tropic day when, “getting towards\r\nevening” the world, released from the ferocious kisses of the vertical\r\nsun, breathes again.\r\n\r\nThe light was still tremendous and triumphant, but the shadows were\r\nlengthening, and the old road broken, now, by wall and palm shadows,\r\nshadows of tamarind and ceiba, filled with scents of tropical wood life\r\nand perfumes from the sea, had regained the poetry robbed from it by\r\nthe glare of noon.\r\n\r\nAh, that old road to Morne Rouge, trodden by the feet of the _porteuse_\r\nand the labourer, the gardeners bringing their fruit to the market of\r\nSt. Pierre, and the cane cutters with their heavy cane knives making\r\nfor the fields, how beautiful it seems, viewed across the past. He who\r\nhas seen from it the city below and the blue enchanted bay, will never\r\nsee a vision more beautiful—and no man will ever see it more.\r\n\r\nAnd its true beauty, one would imagine, only revealed to a child like\r\nMarie, fresh-sighted to the beauty of the world, or a man like Gaspard,\r\nmade clear-sighted by love.\r\n\r\nHe flung the cigarette he was smoking away, and, leaning on the wall,\r\nlooked down at the view, lazily tracing the streets below.\r\n\r\nHe could see the pale green stripe that indicated the verandahs of\r\nthe Rue Victor Hugo; the little Place de la Fontaine; the Rue Petit\r\nVersailles, and, away below, the tamarinds on the Place Bertine. There\r\nlay _La Belle Arlésienne_, a toy ship, and to southward of _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_, fussing along across the bay, the little steamer from Fort\r\nde France; the indescribable splendour of the blue beyond lay unruffled\r\nby the slightest breeze.\r\n\r\nNever was there a more profound calm; towards Dominica where the deep\r\nviolet of the water proclaimed the great depths, an inter-island\r\nschooner lay becalmed like a thing that had made part of the picture\r\nforever. And the silence of it all, the coloured city, the painted\r\nbay, the illimitable distance! With the help of that majestic silence\r\ncompleting her work, Beauty could do nothing more.\r\n\r\n“_Ché!_”\r\n\r\nThe word half whispered, spoken behind him, broke his reverie and made\r\nhim turn.\r\n\r\nShe had come along the road moving soundless as a breeze, she had\r\nreached him without his knowing, she scarcely bore a stain or sign of\r\nher long journey; straight as a caryatid beneath her burden, it was as\r\nif she had carried with her through the long day all the freshness of\r\nthe dawn.\r\n\r\nAll day over morne and mountain, from Morne Rouge to Calabasse, through\r\nthe heat and blinding light, she had followed his image, and she told\r\nhim so, not with her lips, but with her eyes, cast straight at him\r\nunder their long, black, upcurving lashes.\r\n\r\nThe first breath of the evening breeze stirred the fronds of the palms\r\nabove her, fluted gently her robe of delicately-coloured striped\r\nfoulard. The western sunlight enveloped her in its flame as she stood\r\nlike the incarnation of the tropics, the spirit of the western islands,\r\na strophe from the poem of the palm tree, and the azure.\r\n\r\nGaspard took her hands in his and drew her towards him, she shuddered\r\nslightly. He would have kissed her but they were not alone, a woman had\r\njust turned the bend of the road, and from below, the bells of a mule\r\ntold of some market gardener coming up by the steep path from the Rue\r\nVauclin.\r\n\r\n“You have come.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes—did you not think I would come?”\r\n\r\n“O, if I had not thought so I would have flung myself into the sea.”\r\n(Provençal!)\r\n\r\n“You would have cared, then?”\r\n\r\n“Sweet—my only care is now for you.”\r\n\r\nStraight as a flame beneath her load, she listened to him, and as she\r\nlistened, her gaze seemed to pass beyond him to some happy vision in\r\ninfinity. She seemed like a child listening for the first time to the\r\nvoice of Spring. The man holding her hands was quite taken away from\r\nthe world, it was as though she had led him to some extraordinary\r\nheight beyond the clouds and was holding him there by the hands lest he\r\nshould fall.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, for you, that is all I care—just for you—”\r\n\r\nHe held her hands to his heart.\r\n\r\nA bell bird from the trees beyond the road sent her golden notes\r\nfloating on the wind, a shadow passed them, it was a woman, a\r\nmulatress, old, wrinkled, the picture of age.\r\n\r\nThen the mule bells jangled as the mule driven by a negro scrambled\r\nfrom the steep path on to the road and Marie, suddenly, like a person\r\nawakening from a dream drew her hands away. Gaspard turned, more people\r\nwere coming up the steep way from the Rue Vauclin.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he, “let us go away from all these people, where is there,\r\nhere, that we may be quiet, and where you can rest after your journey?”\r\n\r\n“Come with me,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe led the way down towards the town, they passed along one of the\r\nhigher streets and at the door of a heavily-built house, whose green\r\nwindow shutters were drawn against the afternoon sun, she knocked.\r\n\r\nA woman opened the door, she was a _calendeuse_, a friend of Marie’s,\r\nand the girl asked her to take her tray to keep till the next morning.\r\n\r\nThen, released from her load, she kissed the woman on the cheek,\r\nthanked her, and turned to Gaspard.\r\n\r\n“Come,” she said, and the woman closed the door as they passed away\r\ndown the road. They passed along by the highest streets and then down a\r\nsteep way by an old convent wall above which the palms of the convent\r\ngarden bent to the evening wind. Then, by a path between two great\r\ncactus hedges she led him and lo! they were upon the road leading over\r\nthe Morne de Parnasse and close to the gates of the Jardin des Plantes.\r\n\r\nThe old garden had drawn her to it at last. Often and often she had\r\npassed the gates, glancing in at the trees and the gloom, bright and\r\nheedless as a butterfly. One might imagine the spirit of the place\r\nwatching the girl as she passed, singing, light-hearted, walking alone\r\nand content, the spirit which is neither malignant nor benign, the\r\nspirit which sets the _siffleur de montagne_ singing to his mate, calls\r\nflowers into being, sets blossom calling to blossom and bird to bird,\r\none might imagine him casting his spell upon the bright figure, as she\r\npassed his gates the other day, and, now, one might have fancied this\r\nspirit of nature sighing contentedly in the wind-bent trees—she had\r\nobeyed the spell and found a mate.\r\n\r\nThey passed the gateway and entered a world of twilight and perfume.\r\nPalm stems soared away into the gloom above; air shoots of the wild\r\npine, ropes of convolvulus, lianas, festooned and trellised the\r\ntwilight; gigantic ferns called the eye into glades where orchids hung\r\nlike birds come to ruin, butterflies caught in some trap of the air.\r\n\r\nThere was not a sound except the sound of the evening wind bending the\r\npalms and ceibas gently like the caress of a vast hand.\r\n\r\nHere they found themselves alone at last.\r\n\r\nHe took her hands in his; then, releasing them, he held her round the\r\nwaist whilst their lips met and clung together in an endless kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE FATEFUL LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Martinique was a young colony, when Versailles was the palace of\r\na king, away in those sunlit times before the storm of the Revolution,\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes of St. Pierre was a garden. The most curious\r\nand the most beautiful in the world. The spacious imagination that\r\nconceived Versailles touched the tropical forest, and the hand that\r\nlaid out Luciennes fell upon the ceibas, the palmistes and the\r\n_loseille bois_. The poetry and perfect beauty of the tropical trees,\r\nthe splendour of the creeping plants, fathoms of convolvulus, air\r\ngardens where orchids swung suspended by the cables of the Liantasse,\r\ntree ferns, trumpet flowers, star flowers, all lay there waiting for\r\nthe gardener, just as in life all the splendour of passion, the beauty\r\nof love, and the mystery of death lie waiting for the poet.\r\n\r\nHe came and the cutlasses sounded amidst the air shoots and the lianas,\r\nhe destroyed nothing needlessly, pushing the forest back where a path\r\nshould go, making here a fairy lake—less a lake than a mirror for the\r\ntree ferns to see themselves in—here a glade, a twilit home for a\r\nstatue. He heard the murmur of the waterfall, whose voice still sounds\r\nlike a voice of mourning for the ruin of his work, and he brought the\r\nwaterfall into the scheme of things. You can fancy how beautiful it\r\nwas, this garden in the old day, scented, languorous, sunlit, twilit,\r\nfilled with the notes of the bell bird and the _siffleur de montagne_,\r\nthe whisper of the trees and the voice of the waterfall.\r\n\r\nAs certainly as there were flowers in that garden there were lovers;\r\nmen fought and killed one another in the _allée des duels_; what a\r\nvolume of romance lay here brightly written, vivid in colour, of which\r\nremains nothing but a few torn leaves; faded pictures where the forest\r\nhad half blotted out the garden paths and the glades from which the\r\nstatues have vanished.\r\n\r\nThe _fer de lance_ hides amidst the leaves and makes the place\r\nfrightful with death. He is the crowning fascination of the ruined\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nGaspard, releasing the lips of the girl, and holding her warm body\r\nclose to him, kissed her eyes, her forehead, her hair. Beyond the\r\ngates, the roadway like a great white lamp burned in the sun trying\r\nto pierce the gloom. The world seemed trying to peep at them, and the\r\nforest with its great green sleeve to shelter them from the world.\r\n\r\n“Come here—here!—here! forget the world and the road—follow me where\r\nthe ferns are high—into the twilight—come here!—here!”\r\n\r\nA _siffleur de montagne_ in the gloom of the garden was calling to his\r\nmate; they scarcely heard him yet they came, taking a path on the left,\r\na path hemmed on either side by tree ferns and hundred feet soaring\r\npalms.\r\n\r\n“You love me!”\r\n\r\n“_Ché_—I have loved you since the world began.”\r\n\r\nThe reply held all the truth of love.\r\n\r\nShe had loved him since the world began. Aeons before Martinique saw\r\nthe white men from the East, in the dawn of time, dim, cometic, her\r\nbeing had been projected towards his, that she might stand in the\r\nJardin des Plantes clasped in the arms of Gaspard a million ancestors\r\nhad lived and loved, and died; that he might stand clasping her in his\r\narms a million ancestors had fought the battle of life. This embrace\r\nwas the victory of the dead over death, the triumph of life over time.\r\nIn eight words she had spoken the secret which all lovers feel vaguely\r\nin the depths of their being. “I have loved you since the world began.”\r\n\r\nThe voice of the waterfall came now through the trees, a burst of light\r\nshewed where the palms and angelines, the ferns, and the ceibas, gave\r\nplace to the lake into which the torrent falls leaping, rainbowed,\r\ndim with mist from amidst the foliage of the cliff; a hundred feet of\r\ncascading water, every drop a gem. It seemed alive and laughing, if\r\nwater spirit ever lived she surely lived here. Then, as they stood\r\nwatching it, just as though the spirit had lost its gaiety, the rainbow\r\ndazzle passed away and dimness spread through the glade. The sun was\r\nsinking above the treetops.\r\n\r\nMarie glanced up.\r\n\r\n“Come,” she said, “the light is fading—ah, the sun, could he not have\r\nwaited a little longer! but he waits for no one, not even for us.”\r\n\r\nIt was dark when they reached St. Pierre. The night had welled up\r\nfrom the harbour like a flood, the moon was up, and the stars alight\r\nin the dark pansy-blue above, but Pelée’s crest still held a touch of\r\nsunlight. One might have imagined the day standing there just before\r\nflight on that burning crest. Then, spreading wings westward as the\r\nlight left the summit, leaving Martinique to night and the stars.\r\n\r\nAll the way along the road from the Jardin des Plantes the great\r\nfireflies had waltzed and drifted about them, they had heard the first\r\nshuddering of the night wind in the palms, they had paused to listen,\r\nthe night had told them things beyond the comprehension of all but\r\nlovers and poets. The Creole French of the tropics still hold a veil\r\nbetween their minds, yet they understood one another perfectly.\r\n\r\nThey came by the sea way, the harbour was full of stars and the\r\nanchor lights of the ships in the bay, shone like glow-worms, the red\r\nport-light of a steamer sent a red ripple of light across the water.\r\nThey could hear the wash of the little waves against the sea-steps, and\r\nfrom out there somewhere in the starlight the “creak-creak” of oars.\r\n\r\nSome shore boat was putting off from a ship.\r\n\r\n“See,” said Gaspard, “out there, that light near the steamer, that\r\nis _La Belle Arlésienne_.” He had told her on their way back of how\r\nSagesse had pushed forward the expedition intending to start on Friday.\r\nThe news had been a blow to her—how hard a blow he did not guess, for\r\nin the darkness he did not see the tears in her eyes, or the quivering\r\nof her lips.\r\n\r\nShe looked across the water at the fateful light. It seemed to her\r\nsinister, the eye of a _Zombi_ staring straight at her, malignant, and\r\nthreatening.\r\n\r\n“I am taking him away,” said the light, “beyond the rim of the sea; you\r\nhave seen the ships go there, great ships that become little ships,\r\nand then just specks that vanish utterly, just as people vanish when\r\nthey die. Remember Ti Finotte; she passed away like that, and the sun\r\nremains and the blue sea, and sky, but she has not returned—she will\r\nnever come back. Yes, I am taking him away. I am the _Zombi_ who comes\r\nto take away happiness. I change my form as _Zombis_ do; you saw me\r\nonce before, I was then the coffin in which they placed Ti Finotte away\r\nthere, amidst the blowing palms of Morne Rouge, now I am the light that\r\nwill take away your love across the wind-blown sea.”\r\n\r\nShe turned to Gaspard, and casting her arms about his neck, pressing\r\nher face to his breast—sobbed. She could keep a brave heart when he\r\ntold her of his going, she could keep the words back that would tell\r\nhim of her despair, but she could no longer control her tears. Fate\r\nhad spoken to her. That mind which knew nothing, knew everything. In\r\ndays long past, by the blue Caribbean Sea, the women of her remote\r\nancestry had seen their men going away, never, perhaps, to return, and\r\nhad clasped them like this. Grief, who is ageless, had cast them upon\r\nthe breasts of their lovers. Just as in her love she had resumed their\r\nlove, so in her grief she was resuming their sorrow.\r\n\r\nThere by the starlit harbour of St. Pierre, this girl of the people,\r\nclasping this man of the people, formed with him a picture that the\r\npatient stars had watched for ages. The story of love and separation\r\ntold by two forms clinging together—a vision statuesque, eternal.\r\n\r\n“But I will come back—and it is not yet—not for some days—”\r\n\r\n“You will come back?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, believe me, nothing will stop me—nothing—nothing.”\r\n\r\n“It is so far—I do not know where. If I knew; but the ships go away\r\nout there, and it is the distance that takes my heart from me; they\r\nfade into nothing, pass into the sky.”\r\n\r\n“But they come back—you have seen the ships come back?”\r\n\r\nHis voice told her that he was in trouble, and that it was her grief\r\nthat caused his trouble. She could not tell whether the ships she had\r\nseen going away ever came back, the sailing vessels were all alike to\r\nher. The American steamer came back, but it was different from the\r\nothers, but the trouble in his voice made her dry her eyes and answer\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Yes—I had not thought of that, do not mind me, I am foolish—_ché_,\r\nthou wilt surely return. The _Bon Dié_ will surely send you back to me.”\r\n\r\nThe boat that had been rowing across the harbour was now at the steps\r\nnear by, and a man was coming up the steps. It was Sagesse. He did\r\nnot notice them as he walked away towards the town, but they saw him\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\nMarie shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said she, “how late it is—later than I have ever been before,\r\nand the house will be closed.”\r\n\r\nThey turned, and by the Passage Bertine sought the Street of the\r\nPrecipice; there was not a soul to be seen, and the moonlight was now\r\npouring in the city.\r\n\r\nThe old street looked never more mysterious or beautiful than by this\r\nlight, brilliant, yet tinged with the suggestion of death, and snow,\r\nand dreams. Had you seen Marie standing at the door of the house where\r\nshe lived, and knocking for admittance, dressed as she was in her robe,\r\nlight, and graceful as the dress of some Athenian woman, you might have\r\nfancied yourself far from the world of our time, in some street of\r\nMycenae—some moonlit street of Taormina whence the flute-players had\r\njust vanished, leaving behind them silence and the vision of Amaryllis\r\nat her door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE SAILING OF LA BELLE ARLÉSIENNE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock on the fateful Friday morning Gaspard was awakened\r\nfrom sleep by a knock at his door.\r\n\r\nIt was his landlady, Man’m Faly. She had promised to wake him at three,\r\nfor _La Belle Arlésienne_ would cast her moorings and be away at four,\r\nif there was wind enough. Mistrusting herself, the old lady had not\r\ngone to bed.\r\n\r\nWhen he was dressed she returned with a cup of coffee and a plate with\r\na corrossole on it. She had known many lodgers: mates, engineers from\r\nthe French steamers, men of all nationality, but she had never known\r\none to please her better than Gaspard. He never grumbled and he had\r\nalways a kind word. Besides, she knew, as half St. Pierre knew, that\r\nMarie of Morne Rouge had found her man at last, and that the man was\r\nGaspard. The oldest woman on earth is not too old to take interest in a\r\nlove-affair, and Man’m Faly was only sixty.\r\n\r\nShe stood by whilst he drank his coffee. He had paid her the night\r\nbefore, and his few belongings were packed in a canvas bag which she\r\nhad found for him.\r\n\r\n“Ah! well, the _Bon Dié_ knows best, but we would none of us have you\r\ngo. But you will return, that is certain.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I will return—one does not find such a city every day, or\r\nsuch people. But there are storms and chances—”\r\n\r\nHe took a packet from his pocket. It contained all the money he had\r\nleft from the payment he had received at the shipping-office and\r\nthe dollars Sagesse had paid him for the gold coins. Though he had\r\nremembered the prayers for Yves and paid for them, he had quite a\r\nrespectable sum left, for living at St. Pierre was very cheap, and\r\nMarie had saved him from the vices on which foolish shipmen squander\r\ntheir money.\r\n\r\n“—and one never knows what may happen. See here; there is some money\r\nin this packet. It is for the little one, should anything happen to me.\r\nFor Marie, she whom you saw with me yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“I will keep it,” said Man’m Faly.\r\n\r\nShe took the packet and he took up his bag. He cast his eyes round the\r\nroom. It was bare and poorly furnished, but he had been happy there;\r\nin all his wandering life he had never known such happiness; the pure,\r\nsimple, clean happiness of childhood.\r\n\r\nA minute later, he was in the street.\r\n\r\nThe Rue du Morne framed with its houses a glimpse of the sea, and the\r\nupper half of a great moon just sinking beyond the sea-line.\r\n\r\nHe had said good-bye to Marie on the evening before. His heart was\r\nheavy in him; it seemed to him now, as he came down the steep street\r\nto the harbour side, that he was leaving Paradise and leaving it\r\nforever. The coloured city of St. Pierre, the pleasant people, the easy\r\nlife—where would he find a city like that in the whole wide world?\r\n\r\nAnd Marie—\r\n\r\nHe was standing now on the quay-side by the steps. This was the steps\r\nwhere he had told the boat to meet him at daybreak. It was almost due,\r\nfor the moon had sunk now completely, and in a moment Pelée would be\r\ndrawing his silhouette against the ice-blue sky of dawn. The wind\r\nwas faint, just a breathing of air. Out there, beyond the shelter of\r\nthe island, the southeast trades would be blowing, but here there was\r\nscarcely wind enough to move a vessel through the water.\r\n\r\nAs he listened to the wash of the waves against the sea-steps, he heard\r\nthe steady creaking of oars. It was the boat from _La Belle Arlésienne_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock Marie left the house in the street of the Precipice.\r\nThis was not a working day with her. To-morrow, the day after, the day\r\nafter that—all time lay before her to work in. To-day, the saddest day\r\nin her life, would be a holiday.\r\n\r\nAs she passed slowly uphill through the awakening city, she could hear\r\nthe heavy shutters being flung open, voices, the crowing of a cock from\r\nfar away somewhere towards the Rue Buonaparte.\r\n\r\nThis morning, away in the blue sky of dawn, the crest of Mont Pelée,\r\ntouched already by sun-rays, was an extraordinary sight. The cloud\r\nturban, tormented by some wind of the higher air, was streaming upwards\r\nin tongues of misty light; the great mountain seemed to fume—one might\r\nhave fancied it topped by a burning cresset, some signal-fire lit by\r\ngiants or gods.\r\n\r\nShe reached the Rue Vauclin. It was already nearly day, and the road\r\nwas filled with people going to work. From the Rue Victor Hugo below\r\nthe Creole cries of the street-vendors were already sounding; people\r\ngave her good-day as she passed them, and she answered them, and kept\r\non.\r\n\r\nFive minutes more brought her to the road to Morne Rouge. Here she\r\npaused and, leaning on the wall on the seaward side of the road, looked\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nShe was looking at a sight that many people would have crossed the\r\nworld to see—the bay of St. Pierre unfolding to the most lovely\r\nmorning that ever came from heaven. She saw nothing but _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_.\r\n\r\nThe old barquentine had shaken out her canvas and on the strengthening\r\nbreeze was stealing out to sea like a thief. The bay was still in half\r\ntwilight, though beyond the bay the sea was alive with the sun.\r\n\r\nOne might have thought for a moment that _La Belle Arlésienne_ was not\r\nmoving; a moment more, and you would have seen the distance widening\r\nbetween her and the steamer anchored to starboard of her.\r\n\r\nThe girl shaded her eyes with both her hands; then she cast her arms\r\nout as if to clutch back some figure in the air that was leaving her;\r\nthen, leaning on the wall, she looked.\r\n\r\nAs the day grew stronger, the vision of _La Belle Arlésienne_ grew more\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nInfinite distance seemed drawing her away, slowly, almost\r\nimperceptibly; now a ship, now a tiny boat, now a speck vanishing in\r\nthe sun-dazzle above the azure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nPEDRO\r\n\r\n\r\nGaspard, leaning on the taffrail, watched Martinique dwindling in the\r\nsun-blaze and sea-dazzle. Dominica, to eastward, stood vague, and\r\nghostly on the horizon; to westward the sea showed nothing but the\r\npurple of an infinite pansy, an ocean of St. Estèphe or Macon blazed\r\nupon by the fiercest light of the tropics.\r\n\r\nSagesse was standing by the negro who was at the wheel, and _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_ was heading nor’ nor’-west on a course that would take her\r\nto westward of St. Kitts and past the Virgin Islands. Here Sagesse\r\nwould steer a west-nor’-west course. It would be a quicker passage than\r\nin coming, for they had now with them the South Equatorial current.\r\n\r\nGaspard, as he turned from the taffrail, heard Sagesse give an order\r\nfor the hands to man the lee braces. They were beyond the shelter of\r\nthe island now, and the steady blow of the trades was bending _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_ over gently, as though a great hand were playing with\r\nher. “Now I will capsize you,” would sigh the voice to which the hand\r\nbelonged, speaking with a deep hum through the taut, twanging rigging,\r\nwhilst _La Belle_ would bend like an old coquette to the gentle\r\npressure, till, with a groan of the rudder and a dash of sparkling\r\nspray, she would remember herself and come to a more even keel.\r\n\r\nGaspard had noticed the number of the crew when he came on board;\r\nbesides Sagesse and Jules there were ten hands, all negroes, large,\r\nwell set-up men, well fitted for the arduous work before them, with\r\nthe exception of one, an undersized, shifty-eyed and depressed-looking\r\nindividual from Porto Rico.\r\n\r\n“Ten,” said Gaspard to himself, as he counted them. “With Sagesse and\r\nJules that makes twelve, and with me thirteen. Thirteen, and we start\r\non a Friday, and we expect luck!”\r\n\r\n“_Regardez_,” said Sagesse, ranging up beside him and indicating the\r\ncrew. “They are not a bad lot; all but that Porto Rican—he is new to\r\nme and does not know our ways. We will make a better man of him before\r\nthe voyage is over. Look how Jules handles them.”\r\n\r\nAfter Sagesse, Jules was the ruling spirit on board the barquentine.\r\nHe had never to repeat an order, and he was a man much more after\r\nGaspard’s heart than Sagesse; yet he was tainted by Sagesse and, most\r\nevidently his slave.\r\n\r\nThere was only one other person beside Gaspard on board who did not\r\nbend entirely to the eye of the redoubtable Captain, and that was the\r\nPorto Rican. This individual obeyed orders in a surly manner, and\r\nSagesse watched him with a brooding eye.\r\n\r\n“We will make a better man of him before the voyage is over,” said he\r\nagain, as he turned from the hands who were being dismissed, and stood\r\nfor a moment looking to windward at the blue ghost of Dominica.\r\n\r\nGaspard said nothing.\r\n\r\nHe did not even remark on the unlucky number of the crew. He had\r\nimbibed the teaching of M. Seguin with regard to Sagesse, and he felt\r\nthat in this voyage, so filled as it was with the possibilities of\r\nwealth, things might happen of a disastrous nature, and that silence\r\nand watchfulness were essential. He did not in the least know that\r\nSagesse, under the delusion that his plans had been betrayed to M.\r\nSeguin, had sworn to be even with him (Gaspard). He knew nothing of\r\nthis, but something warned him to be silent, civil as possible to this\r\nextraordinary man, and on the look-out. On that day, in fact, began a\r\nduel of intelligence between these two men, the ending of which none\r\ncould forecast from the nature of the men themselves.\r\n\r\nThe expedition had been so rushed that Sagesse felt dissatisfied in\r\nhis mind as to the stowage and condition of some of the most important\r\ngear. The diving-dresses, pumps, tubes and boring instruments were\r\naccordingly brought on deck after dinner from the lockers where they\r\nhad been stowed.\r\n\r\nSagesse, who knew a little of everything, and whose natural genius and\r\ncommonsense supplied most deficiencies in his knowledge, had the pump\r\ntaken to pieces and each piece greased thick and wrapped in canvas;\r\nthe metal parts of the diving-dresses were treated with the same care,\r\nonly in a different manner; the dresses themselves, the air tubes, the\r\nwhole gear down to the least detail came bit by bit under his careful\r\ninspection and received as much attention as possible to protect it\r\nfrom the influence of the sea air and the tropical rot that touches all\r\nthings from metal to morals.\r\n\r\nAt eight bells (four o’clock) Gaspard, who had retired to his bunk\r\nfor a doze, was awakened by a cry from the deck. He had left the door\r\nof his cabin wide open and the deck-house door being also open, he\r\ncould see the white, sunlit deck, the figure of Sagesse, the figures\r\nof several of the crew and something lying on the deck before Sagesse.\r\nHe tumbled out of his bunk and came through the deck-house into the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nSagesse was holding a belaying-pin in his hand, and the thing on the\r\ndeck before him was the Porto Rican, Pedro.\r\n\r\nThe man was covered with blood from a wound in the forehead. He was\r\njust raising himself on one hand as Gaspard came on the scene, and he\r\nlooked dazed, like a person awakening from sleep. Next moment, he was\r\nscrambling on to his feet, literally kicked on to them by Sagesse, and\r\nmaking for the fo’cs’le, where he disappeared, followed by a shout of\r\nlaughter from the men on deck.\r\n\r\n“That will teach him,” said the Captain, flinging the belaying-pin in\r\nthe weather scupper and wiping his brow with his coat-sleeve; then,\r\nas he turned, he saw Gaspard and started slightly. His face wore an\r\nexpression of chill ferocity quite new to Gaspard; it was as though the\r\ndevil in the man had taken possession of his features for a moment—a\r\nmoment only, for the next he was laughing and himself again.\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said he. “I believe the scamp made me lose my temper.” He\r\nstepped to the weather rail, shaded his eyes and looked over the sea.\r\nDominica had vanished, painted out by distance; a star of light on\r\nthe far horizon indicated the topsails of a ship hull down beyond the\r\nsea-line; nothing else was to be seen.\r\n\r\n“We’ll see no more land till we touch the Virgins,” said Sagesse. “From\r\nthere to your island, _compère_ Gaspard, is, as near as I can make it,\r\nthree hundred and sixty miles; from here to the Virgins is a matter of\r\ntwo hundred and ninety, so you can add the sums together, and you will\r\nknow the length of your road.”\r\n\r\n“What are we doing?”\r\n\r\n“Eight knots.”\r\n\r\n“When will we get there?”\r\n\r\n“_Bon Dieu_, how you talk! We are in the hands of the wind.”\r\n\r\nGaspard filled his pipe and lit it, Sagesse, leaning against the\r\nbulwarks, lit a Martinique _bout_ and with his hands in his pockets\r\nlooked lazily over the sea.\r\n\r\n“See here,” said Gaspard, after a moment’s silence. “Suppose we reach\r\nthat place all right, and suppose we find stuff there—”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Well, how are we to get rid of it?”\r\n\r\nSagesse laughed.\r\n\r\n“You are one of those that look far ahead. So am I. Suppose we find\r\nstuff there, well, who does it belong to but us? We have located it, we\r\nhave got an expedition together to find it, the island belongs to no\r\ngovernment, the stuff belonged to people who were dead when you and I\r\nwere born. The stuff belongs to us by all right. Is that not so?”\r\n\r\n“As you put it, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my friend, there is no such thing as Right in this world. As\r\nsoon as it is known that we have found the old money-box, broken her\r\nopen and taken the contributions, some government will say, ‘That\r\nisland is mine,’ some man will rise up with a lying charter, proving\r\nthat he bought the island and the ship years ago, some rascal trick\r\nwill be played by some rascal, and we will have law-suits; the stuff\r\nwill be impounded, witnesses will be brought from the ends of the world\r\nto bear false witness, our characters will be enquired into—” Sagesse\r\nlaughed as he spoke, crossed the deck to the lee rail, spat into the\r\nsea, and returned. “They will say, these lawyer-men, ‘who is this\r\nMonsieur Sagesse who finds old treasure-ships? Let’s hunt up all about\r\nhim, and if we can’t find anything against him, let us make something\r\nagainst him.’ No, my friend, I wish to have nothing to do with the law;\r\nnothing to do with governments; nothing to do with enemies on this\r\noccasion. So, being a man who looks ahead, I have already made my\r\nplans for disposing of the stuff in America—” Sagesse came to a dead\r\nstop. His habit of talking had got possession of him and carried him\r\nfurther than he meant to go.\r\n\r\n“In America?”\r\n\r\n“There, or somewhere else.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Jules came out of the fo’cs’le, where only a few minutes\r\nbefore Pedro had disappeared, and came along the deck to Sagesse. He\r\nspoke a couple of words in an undertone, and Sagesse following him they\r\nboth went forward.\r\n\r\nGaspard watched them vanishing down the fo’cs’le hatch. The thought\r\nthat Pedro had been seriously injured crossed his mind for a moment,\r\nbut his mind, filled with the words of Sagesse, had no room for\r\nthoughts about Pedro. America! If they had to go to America to dispose\r\nof the stuff, the voyage might last months, and to Gaspard the few\r\nhours that had passed since losing sight of Martinique seemed months.\r\nHe had found all he wanted in life, and he had left it behind him there\r\nin Martinique.\r\n\r\nAs he stood waiting for Sagesse to return and finish the conversation,\r\nhe saw Marie again just as he had seen her that day on the cliff at\r\nGrande Anse, the sea wind fluttering her robe and the sun clasping her\r\nlittle head between his two great golden hands.\r\n\r\nThen Sagesse appeared, returning from the fo’cs’le, but he did not seem\r\nin a humour to continue the conversation.\r\n\r\nHe seemed disturbed in his mind about something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nA FORT DE FRANCE, AY, HO!\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night when Gaspard was on deck, smoking a pipe before turning in,\r\nhe heard the sound of laughter coming from away forward.\r\n\r\nThere was no light on deck but the light of the binnacle lamp and a\r\nglimmer from a crack in the deck-house door which was closed, and out\r\nof the darkness away forward came this sudden shock of laughter, not\r\nloud, but hard, mirthless, and inhuman.\r\n\r\nIf a fiend had dropped from the sky and stridden the bowsprit, he might\r\nhave emitted such a laugh at _La Belle Arlésienne_, her captain, her\r\ncrew, and her venture before putting his blight upon the vessel and\r\nwhooping into the sea.\r\n\r\nGaspard glanced at the steersman. He was a big negro, naked to his\r\nwaist in the hot night, a colossal figure touched by the binnacle\r\nlight. Whether he heard or whether he did not hear it was impossible\r\nto say; he shewed neither sign nor movement, with the exception of the\r\nmovement of the great right hand upon the wheel spoke, now visible, now\r\nfleeting into darkness.\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_” muttered Gaspard to himself, “the fellow that made that\r\nlaugh would not make the pleasantest companion. Let us listen—”\r\n\r\nHe leaned on the bulwark rail.\r\n\r\nThe hot southeast trade wind coming out of the velvety darkness\r\nwhispered in the shrouds and set the reef points pattering; the warm,\r\nwindy, starry night had a perfume more than the perfume of the sea;\r\nsome trace of scent from the gardens and forests of Dominica, some hint\r\nof the spices of Guadaloupe hung on the skirts of the wind.\r\n\r\nThen, all of a sudden, from forward came again the voice, not laughing\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n    _A Fort de France, Ay ho!\r\n    A Fort de France, Ay ho!\r\n      Bonjour Doudoux, Ay ho!\r\n      A Fort de France.\r\n      A Fort de France,\r\n                      Ay ho!_\r\n\r\nThe chanty of the negroes when they were breaking the cargo out of _La\r\nBelle Arlésienne_ sung by that single cracked voice. Now, the negro\r\nsailor, or the white, for the matter of that, never sings a working\r\nchanty for the pleasure of the thing. Who was this, then, breaking\r\nimaginary cargo or tramping at the capstan bars of some visionary\r\nvessel?\r\n\r\nThe deck-house door opened and a burst of light flooded the deck.\r\n\r\nSagesse stood for a moment framed in the doorway. He seemed listening\r\nto the voice from forward; then he saw Gaspard and called him to come\r\ninto the deck-house.\r\n\r\nA case bottle of rum was on the table, two glasses, and a pitcher of\r\nwater; one of the glasses held some rum in it. Sagesse had evidently\r\nbeen drinking by himself. His face had a grey tinge; something had\r\nevidently disturbed him.\r\n\r\nHe shut the door, filled a glass for Gaspard, placed a box of cigars on\r\nthe table, all without a word; then he took his seat at the table and\r\nbegan talking of the voyage in the desultory manner of a man who wishes\r\nto make conversation.\r\n\r\nNow and again, as he talked, he ceased, as if to listen. Now, there was\r\nnothing to be heard but the voice of the ship, the creak of block and\r\nstanchion, the hundred small tongues by which the vessel speaks. Then,\r\nthin and far away, would come the other voice:\r\n\r\n    _A Fort de France, Ay ho!_\r\n\r\nthin, weary, the ghost of a sound.\r\n\r\nGaspard knew now all at once, from Sagesse’s manner, that the singer\r\nwas Pedro, that the man was delirious, probably dying.\r\n\r\nBut he said nothing. Pedro, what he had seen of him, was a hang-dog\r\nlooking scoundrel; he did not feel very much interested in his fate,\r\nthough hating the idea that he had been brutally knocked about. What\r\nabsorbed his attention now was the manner of Sagesse.\r\n\r\nThe Captain had filled his glass, finished it, and filled again; he\r\ntalked incessantly, and the talk seemed to intoxicate him as much as\r\nthe rum; the more intoxicated he grew the less did he care about the\r\nmatter which had been on his mind.\r\n\r\nThen, at length, he rose to his feet and flung the deck-house door open\r\nfor air. He stood for a moment in the doorway, as if listening; but\r\nthere was nothing to hear, for the voice had ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE FO’CS’LE\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day Sagesse shewed signs neither of his intoxication of the past\r\nnight nor of the worry that had preceded it. Neither did the deck shew\r\nsign of Pedro.\r\n\r\nWas the man dead, or was he lying in his hammock, recovering from his\r\ninjuries? It was impossible to say; the faces of the crew told nothing.\r\n\r\nThe weather was perfect, blue and warm, and _La Belle Arlésienne_, with\r\nevery rag of canvas set, was making good way.\r\n\r\nIf a ship could develop a character, one might have fancied _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_ infected with the character of Sagesse; at least so it\r\nseemed to Gaspard. There was something stealthy and almost underhand\r\nin this old tramp of the ocean. He could remember, the first day he\r\nsighted her hull down on the horizon, how she had grown upon the\r\nsky-line, how she had come towards him as he lay drifting in the open\r\nboat like an angel to his rescue, and then, the light and wind dying\r\nwith the sunset, how she had all at once seemed to forget him.\r\n\r\nHow she had vanished for a moment in the darkness, and then had come\r\nstealing along in the starlight.\r\n\r\nShe was sixty years old, and more, built in Havannah in the early\r\nforties; age was telling against her, and it may have been the touch of\r\nage, added to the cut of her ill-fitting sails and some trend in her\r\nbuild, that gave her distinction over other ships. Who knows? But the\r\nfact remains that she was a “character,” picturesque in any port of the\r\nworld, and romantic with a suggestion of villainy and deceit.\r\n\r\nBut to-day she moved with a freedom and youthfulness, as though\r\nrejoicing in the depths of her old heart at the business on hand.\r\n\r\nAt eight bells, four o’clock, there was still no sign of Pedro on deck,\r\nnor word about him. Sagesse was nowhere to be seen, the deck-house door\r\nwas closed, and Gaspard determined on a bold stroke.\r\n\r\nHe must verify his suspicions. If Pedro had been done to death by\r\nSagesse it was important for him to have first-hand knowledge of the\r\nfact, which would be a weapon against this villain should he give\r\ntrouble in the future.\r\n\r\nHe went forward, passing the green-painted bell from which one of the\r\ncrew had just rung out the hour.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the hands were on deck, but not Jules. This man, though\r\nhe was mate and had a knowledge of navigation sufficient to work the\r\nvessel, berthed in the fo’cs’le with the others. He was no doubt there.\r\n\r\nNow, the fo’cs’le of a ship is sacred to the hands. It is entered\r\nby the ship’s officers rarely, and only on extraordinary occasions.\r\nGaspard knew this fact, but the knowledge did not deter him.\r\n\r\nHe went to the fo’cs’le hatch, and descended the ladder into gloom and\r\na stifling atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt was a roomy enough place, as fo’cs’les go, and considering the\r\ntonnage of _La Belle Arlésienne_, but all the winds of heaven could\r\nnever have purged it of the scent of blackbeetles and negroes. The\r\nslush lamps that had lit it for sixty years, the tobacco, from\r\nPerique to twist, that had been smoked there, the men, from Dagoes to\r\nAfricans, who had lived there, all had left a reminiscence, a taint,\r\nalmost one might say a colour.\r\n\r\nBunks lined the sides; there was only one hammock, it belonged to\r\nJules; only one sea-chest, Jules’; the rest of the crew did not trouble\r\nabout luggage very much—a knotted handkerchief or an old fish-mat\r\nserving them for bags and chests. The bunks ran up to where the heel of\r\nthe bowsprit came into the place between the knightheads.\r\n\r\nThere were five men here, all asleep; Jules in his hammock and the\r\nfour others in bunks; naked, for they had kicked off the last of their\r\nclothes in the stifling heat; and looking like bronze figures cast by\r\nsome fantastic sculptor, fresh from the mould, and flung here and there\r\nto cool.\r\n\r\nPedro was not here.\r\n\r\nGaspard carefully verified the fact. The man must have died in the\r\nnight and been cast overboard like a dog. There could be no doubt of\r\nthe fact, for on _La Belle Arlésienne_ there was no other place where\r\nhe could be but here, unless he were stowed in the lazarette, in the\r\ncaboose, in the harness cask or shot down the main hatch. Overboard\r\nwas a much more tenable supposition. The thing had probably been done\r\nbefore dawn, and as Gaspard recognised the fact and looked around\r\nhim at these grim figures lost in sleep, his own position on board,\r\nshould anything bring him into opposition with Sagesse, came before him\r\nvividly.\r\n\r\nWithout clothes, naked, and barbaric, lit by the dim rays of the\r\nswinging lamp, here were the men who would give him short shrift and\r\na plunge in the sea at the word of their commander. Pedro was one of\r\nthemselves, yet they had made no opposition to his murder.\r\n\r\nAs he stood looking, a man in one of the starboard bunks tossed his\r\narms and moved in his sleep. Gaspard did not wait. A moment later he\r\nwas on deck. He had been lucky; the cook who had been in the caboose\r\nhad not left it, the men on deck, all except the man at the wheel,\r\nwere lazing in the afternoon sunshine. Three of them were seated with\r\ntheir backs to the after part of the main hatch, chewing tobacco, and\r\nyarning; he could see the tops of their heads and hear their voices\r\nyaw-yawing, their laughter and an occasional oath; two were leaning\r\nover the side of the vessel to leeward, yarning, and spitting into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe door of the deck-house was still closed. There was no lookout\r\nforward, the individual who ought to have been the eyes of the ship was\r\nleaning over the rail to leeward.\r\n\r\nDiscipline in this respect was rather lax on board _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_. She took chances in fine weather; she seemed blind very\r\noften, yet she found her way about, rarely making a serious mistake.\r\nGaspard imagined that the crew of this blind and easy-going vessel\r\nwere unobservant and that his expedition into the fo’cs’le had passed\r\nunnoticed. In this he was wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLVER\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later, in a pink and pearl dawn, they passed the Virgin\r\nIslands, their shoals and sand spits.\r\n\r\nBy eight o’clock the islands were just palms low down on the sea,\r\nswimming in an azure haze; they had vanished completely before noon.\r\n\r\nNot a word had been said by Sagesse about Pedro, and Gaspard imagined\r\nthat the captain held off the subject under the impression that he\r\n(Gaspard) had forgotten the Porto Rican’s existence.\r\n\r\nThere was something almost uncanny in this vanishing of a man and the\r\nutter indifference of all on board. Imagination embroidered upon the\r\nsituation and asked questions not the less disturbing because they were\r\nunanswerable.\r\n\r\nHad the wretched man died in his bunk, delirious from brain fever\r\nfollowing the injury, or had he been flung overboard before death?\r\n\r\nThe imaginative mind of Gaspard found much to play with in this idea.\r\nHe pictured the business done in the small hours of the morning, whilst\r\nhe was asleep. He dreamed of it at night.\r\n\r\nPedro became an obsession with him, just as the dead Yves had become an\r\nobsession on the island. What had happened to this man whom he had seen\r\nalive and well, yet who had gone off the ship without a word?\r\n\r\nHe _knew_ that Pedro had been killed by the blow of the belaying-pin,\r\njust as on the island he had known that Yves was dead amidst the\r\nbushes; but imagination takes little heed of facts once she gets rein,\r\nand incessantly he was haunted by the idea of the vanished man; the\r\nchanty he had been singing in his delirium clung like a ghostly echo to\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nThis trouble of the imagination was not eased by the conditions of his\r\nlife on board, the absolute idleness and the presence at all times of\r\nSagesse. He was passing swiftly from dislike to hatred of Sagesse.\r\n\r\nOn this day of their passing the Virgin Islands his ill-temper and\r\nirritability had come to a crisis, and it was only by keeping away from\r\nhis companion that he could hold himself in check. He had been silent\r\nat breakfast, but the Captain did not seem to notice his silence. All\r\nduring the morning he had kept as much as possible to himself, smoking,\r\nleaning over the side, watching the indigo-blue water swirling past,\r\nthe flakes of foam, the flying-fish, the sun dazzles, the floating\r\nseaweeds. There were tiny fish following _La Belle Arlésienne_ close\r\nto the rudder, as if for protection; sometimes these would dart away\r\nfrom the ship and back again, needle-bright and swift. A glancing blue\r\nand gold form appeared and hovered for a moment in view; beneath it\r\nappeared what seemed the trace of a sand-spit, vague, misty, and moving\r\nas though to keep pace with the ship. It was a shark, and the blue\r\nand gold angel of the sea was its pilot. They vanished. Sharks do not\r\nfollow nigger ships, they say. Gaspard did not know or care; he watched\r\nthe depths like a man mesmerised, seeing, scarcely seeing, not caring\r\nwhat he saw. He was thinking of Marie,—Marie of Morne Rouge, from\r\nwhom this cursed ship was taking him moment by moment further away and\r\nagainst his will.\r\n\r\nHe was brought back from his thoughts by one bell striking and by the\r\nshadow of the cook bearing dinner from the galley to the deck-house.\r\n\r\nCanned beef stewed with carrots formed the repast, with the eternal\r\nbananas of the tropics. Sagesse was hungry, and therefore silent.\r\nGaspard was silent, but he was not hungry.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this man, whom he was beginning to loathe, at his food\r\nwould have taken his appetite away had he possessed one. The meal went\r\non in silence, and Sagesse was pushing his plate away, and had reached\r\nout his hand for the bottle to fill his glass, when Gaspard leaned\r\nacross the table.\r\n\r\n“I counted the crew when I came on board,” said Gaspard, “and it seems\r\nto me that I made a mistake.”\r\n\r\n“How so?” asked Sagesse, helping himself from the bottle.\r\n\r\n“I counted eleven hands which, with you and me, would make thirteen\r\nsouls on board.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Sagesse, helping himself from the glass, “what of that?”\r\n\r\n“Thirteen was an unlucky number.”\r\n\r\n“So you believe in that nonsense?”\r\n\r\n“Do not you?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, look—what has happened since we started?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“Think!”\r\n\r\nGaspard was working himself up, impulse and imagination were laying\r\ntheir hands on him; he forgot safety, he forgot Marie, he forgot even\r\nhimself in the anger of his soul before this smooth-faced scoundrel,\r\nthis cold calculator of chances, this murderer with the soul of a\r\nstore-keeper.\r\n\r\n“Think!—a man has been lost already off this ship.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Sagesse, his hand falling from his glass to the pocket\r\nof his coat.\r\n\r\n“Murdered, _mordieu_!” said the other, who was now white to the lips.\r\n\r\nNext moment he had flung himself across the table. He was not a second\r\ntoo soon. Sagesse had drawn a revolver from his pocket; it was a stupid\r\nact and unlike him, but his strange character, so antagonistic as a\r\nrule to anger and violence, had become infected with the rage of his\r\nvis-a-vis; he felt, perhaps, that Gaspard in surprising his deed had\r\nnow a hold upon him, that the crew, bowed by his will as they were,\r\nwould, if brought before one of those infernal examining magistrates,\r\ninevitably break down, contradict each other and give him away. Anger,\r\nuppermost in his mind for a second, dictated the attempt to destroy\r\nthis witness. But Gaspard was too quick for him. He had seized him by\r\nthe wrist with an iron grip, the muzzle of the revolver was pointing to\r\nthe roof of the deck-house. The whole thing had happened in a flash,\r\nwith scarcely a sound, and had you looked in through the door you might\r\nhave fancied the two men were larking. But a second glance would have\r\nshown you that Gaspard, half lying across the table, had seized a knife\r\nin his left hand.\r\n\r\n“Drop it,” said Gaspard, “or, _sang-Dieu_, I will drive this through\r\nyour heart—assassin!”\r\n\r\nSagesse, whose anger had vanished, released his clutch on the revolver.\r\nIt fell on the table, and Gaspard, seizing it, resumed his seat.\r\n\r\nSagesse, rising from his, went quietly to the door, which was half\r\nopen, closed it, and turned to his companion.\r\n\r\n“We are fools,” he said. “Sit down. I am not coming near you. But to\r\nquarrel like this—we are fools!”\r\n\r\n“I may be a fool, but I am not a murderer.”\r\n\r\nSagesse pointed to the knife that had fallen on the table, and laughed\r\nas he re-took his seat.\r\n\r\n“Maybe not, but it seems to me you were handy enough with that knife a\r\nmoment ago. I did not say you were a fool alone; I said we were fools\r\nquarrelling in the after guard, with a crew like this and treasure\r\nahead. The _bon Dieu_ only knows if we may not be fighting together\r\nfor our lives before long, if we are lucky, and if those black beasts\r\nchoose to rise up against us. Do you know that my position here is not\r\nso much the master of a ship as the master of a menagerie? You got\r\nthe better of me for a moment. I did not intend to shoot you. I drew\r\nin anger, I gave way for a second to that child’s passion. That was a\r\nfault, but I mastered it. But suppose—look you here—suppose one of\r\nthose animals had come in and found us at grips, and you holding me\r\nlike that, where would my authority have been? And, I tell you, it is\r\nby authority only that you and I will live through this business, for\r\nthe fellows forward have hell in them, and they only want pricking to\r\nlet it out.\r\n\r\n“You say a man has gone overboard. Well, that is my business, and it\r\nis better that one man should go than that we should have our throats\r\ncut. That fellow was full of mutiny, and I sent him where he’d got\r\nto go sooner or later. That’s my business. And now hand me over that\r\nrevolver. Or stay—” He went to his cabin and came back in a moment\r\nwith another revolver. He handed it to Gaspard.\r\n\r\n“It’s loaded. I brought it for you in case we had trouble with these\r\nfellows. You can take it now and give me back mine.”\r\n\r\nGaspard opened the breech. It was loaded. He handed Sagesse’s weapon\r\nback to him, and Sagesse put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Sagesse, “let us be friends till this business is over.\r\nThat is to say, let us work together, for if we do not, we will pull\r\nnothing out of the fire—and I can tell you this, we have our work cut\r\nout before us.”\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand, and Gaspard took it; but there was no friendship\r\nin the grip, only policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE VISION OF TREASURE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that day Sagesse’s manner changed. One might have fancied that the\r\nman’s nature had changed; a friendliness and a bonhomie never exhibited\r\nbefore appeared in his tone and conversation. Gaspard’s simple and\r\nsomewhat primitive mind rejected the first overtures towards this\r\nbetter understanding; he suspected treachery; but the manner of the\r\ncaptain was so uniformly equable and sustained that the primitive mind\r\ncould not but fall under its spell.\r\n\r\nNo man could act friendship like that and keep the acting up, thought\r\nGaspard; and in this he was perhaps right. Sagesse had the power of\r\nclosing a door on all sorts of passions and hanging the key up; just as\r\na visitor to an hotel hangs the key of his room up, forgetting it; or\r\nrather putting it out of his mind till, the business of the day over,\r\nhe remembers the key and enters his room.\r\n\r\nAt nights, over rum and water, smoking Martinique cigars, without his\r\ncoat, seated at the table in his shirt-sleeves like the prosperous\r\nlandlord of some Provençal auberge, Sagesse would give rein to his\r\ntongue and imagination. Treasure, now, was his entire theme, or nearly\r\nso.\r\n\r\n“Mark you,” he would say, “I have been trading in these waters now for\r\nthirty years and more, and this is the first treasure-ship business\r\nI have taken up, because it is the first time I have seen the chance\r\nof profit. Yes, I have had hundreds of knaves and fools coming to me\r\nwith ‘locations.’ _Mordieu_, I have had men bring me ‘locations’ in\r\nfive hundred fathom water, in channels where any fool would know the\r\nrush of the tide made working impossible, over reefs that a child might\r\nguess would saw a ship asunder in six months—but here we have a thing\r\nperfectly new, a ship lying in a few fathoms of still water, tucked\r\naway safe for us. Of course, she may have been visited and sacked years\r\nago, but I don’t think so.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“For this reason: If she is Serpente’s ship, she has been lying there a\r\ngreat many years, under water all the time, with water deep enough to\r\nprevent salvage unless with diving apparatus, and they hadn’t diving\r\napparatus handy in those days. If people had got at her recently, they\r\nwould have dynamited her. She would not be lying there so quietly, take\r\nmy word for it, if the Americans or the Spaniards had smelt her out.”\r\n\r\n“You think she is really Serpente’s ship?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that he was really a man like what Monsieur Jaques made\r\nout?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n_“Ma foi!_ why—if he was like what Monsieur Jaques said, he would have\r\nbeen unlike any other man.”\r\n\r\n“Which he was,” replied Sagesse. “Now, look you here. One may listen\r\nto old wives’ tales by the hour and get no profit, but when one gets\r\nan old wife’s tale repeated and repeated, and always the same, one may\r\nclaim there is truth in it. The stories and the pictures of Serpente\r\nall tally—why, _mordieu_, you yourself have seen his skull, which I\r\nhope to find and keep as a curiosity.”\r\n\r\n“As for me,” said Gaspard, “I never want to see the thing again. I do\r\nnot care what you say about old wives’ tales, but I believe this, that\r\nSerpente was the devil in the form of a man—”\r\n\r\n“Or a child,” laughed Sagesse, “or a monkey, for he wasn’t bigger—in\r\nhis head-piece, anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“—monkey or child or man, what I have said I have said. He was the\r\ndevil, or as much of himself as the devil could stuff into such a\r\ncarcase, and if he lets us off that island with the gold, all I can say\r\nis, the devil’s dead or gone out of business.”\r\n\r\nSagesse laughed, and lit another cigar, and turned the subject. He felt\r\na profound contempt for the superstition of Gaspard, but he did not\r\nshew it.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the seventh day out he came up to Gaspard, who was\r\nsitting on the main hatch, took his seat beside him, and unrolled a\r\nsmall chart.\r\n\r\n“We ought to be there to-morrow, shortly after sun-up, if this wind\r\nholds,” said Sagesse, spreading the chart on his knee. “I got this from\r\nJaques; it’s a French Admiralty chart of Turks Island and the Caicos,\r\nat least a bit of it; the whole thing was as big as a blanket and I cut\r\nthis piece out. The _Diane_—she was a French cruiser—included our\r\nisland when she was out here ten years ago taking soundings. She little\r\nthought how useful it would be to us.”\r\n\r\nGaspard looked at the chart. There was the island, no bigger than a\r\nsixpence, the reefs and shoals all carefully mapped out. It gave him\r\na strange sensation to see this picture of the place that for him had\r\nthe mystery of dreamland attached to it; there were times when he half\r\nbelieved the island to be non-existent and that _La Belle Arlésienne_,\r\nsail the blue sea as far as she might, would never raise that landfall.\r\nYet here it was pictured out by men who had visited the spot ten years\r\nbefore he had landed there.\r\n\r\nIt had been waiting there all these years for him, to shew him the\r\nmeaning of desolation and Death, just as the little Place de la\r\nFontaine had been waiting for him to shew him Love.\r\n\r\nAh! those places that wait for us since the time we were born! the\r\nplaces where we part with and meet the people we love, the place where\r\nwe shall lie down to die!—we never reckon them amidst our friends\r\nand enemies; yet what friends are more faithful, what enemies more\r\ninexorable?\r\n\r\nHe looked attentively at the little picture. A hair’s-breadth beyond\r\nthe southern edge he knew that the body of Yves was lying amidst the\r\nbay-cedar bushes, in the middle, there, the bones of Serpente, just\r\nbeyond the northern edge, the ship of coral patient in the green\r\nlagoon; that tiny spur to southward was the place where he stood when\r\nhe first felt the haunting “grue,” and from there he had swum to the\r\nboat. The sea gulls would still be flying over those reefs to the\r\nsoutheast, calling wheeling, fishing.—\r\n\r\n“It’s all clear water to westward,” said Sagesse. “Ten fathom close\r\nin shore; we can anchor there; sandy beach, you told me it was, to\r\nsouthward—are you sure?”\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu!_ Sure! If you had been there, as I was, you would be sure.”\r\nHe had grown so friendly with Sagesse in the last few days that he\r\ncould talk about intimate things to him, and with southern vehemence he\r\nbegan to paint rapidly in words the horror of that time, lost, locked\r\naway by the sea on that spot where the wind and the sun and the silence\r\nwere conspirators with madness.\r\n\r\nSagesse listened, and never did a man seem more friendly and interested\r\nthan Captain Pierre Sagesse, as he sat on the main hatch of _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_, listening to the tale of the man whom he had sworn in his\r\nheart to be revenged on; but not by the brutal methods of ordinary\r\nrevenge that would have satisfied an ordinary man.\r\n\r\nThat night Gaspard did not join Sagesse in his rum-and-water; he\r\nsmoked his pipe on deck. The moon would not rise till after midnight,\r\nand though the stars were unclouded they were paled to insignificance\r\nby the sea. _La Belle Arlésienne_ seemed sailing through an ocean of\r\nliquid phosphorus. The sea burned white, dimly glowing in the distance\r\nlike a snow-covered country, brightly glowing at the ship’s side, and\r\nfuriously smouldering in the wake; it was the light of dead-wood, of\r\ncorpse fires, of things rotten, dismal as the light from the lake of\r\nDante where dwell the spirits of the damned.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock Gaspard went to his bunk; Sagesse, with the prospect of\r\na hard day’s work on the morrow, was already in his and snoring. The\r\ndeck was in charge of Jules.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Gaspard could not sleep, haunted by the thoughts of the\r\nmorrow. Notwithstanding his hatred of the island and his half-formed\r\nresolve to have no share in the treasure, the treasure had already\r\nlaid ghostly hands upon him. No man can withstand the fascination of\r\nthe near presence of free gold. Men may be cold to women, to wine, to\r\nsin, but gold hidden and to be had for the finding is a magnet for\r\n_all_ men, even as it was for Gaspard. He had been brooding upon it all\r\nday, and now, as he lay in his bunk, it chased away sleep; it made him\r\nforget Marie.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that this fatal island had the power of casting him\r\nfrom his proper path. Here for the sake of the gold in the belt he had\r\nforgotten his brotherhood to Yves, here for the sake of the gold in the\r\nship he was forgetting his love for the woman who loved him.\r\n\r\nA week ago he had no thought for the treasure; four days ago he had\r\nlittle thought of it; yesterday it was beginning to haunt his dreams;\r\nto-night it had him in its grip. The nearer they came to it, the\r\nstronger grew the attraction.\r\n\r\nAs he lay in his bunk he saw sacks large as corn-sacks bursting with\r\nnapoleons; he saw jewels such as he had seen in the shop windows of\r\nMarseilles; he saw wealth, not as a power to be used, but in its crude\r\nform of wealth. And this is how Serpente had seen it, and all these\r\nlousy pirates, who, incapable of using gold except in a tavern or a\r\ngambling-hell, ransacked the Caribbean, slew men, and with the wealth\r\nof the Indies in their pockets found peace at last in a noose.\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep, only to dream of gold, and he awoke shortly before dawn\r\nwith a dry mouth and a burning forehead.\r\n\r\nHe came on deck. Sagesse had relieved Jules and was standing by the man\r\nat the wheel. The moon, in her last quarter, held the sea; she was low\r\ndown on the horizon and the stars above were bright and huge; the wind\r\nhad fallen to a gentle breathing, just filling the sails which slatted\r\nnow and then with a sound like the wing of a great bird.\r\n\r\nGaspard spoke a word to Sagesse, and then went forward a bit and leaned\r\non the starboard bulwarks. He lit a pipe. The slow way on the vessel\r\nirritated him. What if the wind fell to a dead calm? It seemed almost\r\nimpossible that this was the man who had fled from the place that he\r\nwas now so anxious to reach, the man who had tried to dissuade Sagesse\r\nfrom the venture which now filled his being with fire and anxiety.\r\n\r\nHe leaned for a while smoking, motionless, in a reverie; then, as if\r\nsuddenly awakened to some disagreeable fact, he started and smacked his\r\nhand on the bulwark.\r\n\r\n“Fifteen per cent.! Fifteen francs out of every hundred francs! _Coquin\r\nde sort!_ never! He thought he had me tied up with Yves in fear of the\r\nlaw. Well, how about Pedro? It seems to me if he threatens me with\r\nYves, I can threaten him with Pedro, and a ship’s company to bear\r\nwitness! Fifty per cent.! I will stick to that. But I will say nothing\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\nNow in the sky to eastward the darkness was paling and stars that were\r\nthere shining brightly a moment ago had vanished.\r\n\r\nSome atmospheric influence had caught the first faintest sunrays and\r\nheld them from spreading in a fan-shaped haze, grey, then spreading to\r\nblue, luminous with fire. Almost before one could say, “It is no longer\r\nnight,” day was coming over the sea like a golden breeze.\r\n\r\n“Land ho! Ahoy! Ahee! Land ho!”\r\n\r\nThin, in the French of the colonies, came the cry from the maintop,\r\nwhere Sagesse had stationed a hand.\r\n\r\nGaspard sprang on the bulwark and, clinging with one hand to the\r\nratlines of the mainmast, shaded his eyes with the other hand and\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\n_La Belle Arlésienne_ was heading now N.N.W., and there, away on the\r\nsky-line, traced as if with a fine brush, the palm tops of Skeleton\r\nIsland caught his eye. The beach would be visible from the maintop, but\r\nfrom here one could only see the trees as yet.\r\n\r\nGaspard, as he gazed, could hear the voice of Sagesse giving orders,\r\nthe clicking of the rudder chains, and then the palms swung slowly out\r\nof sight as the vessel altered her course and jib and foresail clouded\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe dropped on to the deck.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Sagesse, coming up, “_La Belle Arlésienne_ is not late at\r\nthe _rendezvous_. She knows her way about, does _La Belle_. We will\r\nbe at our anchorage in an hour, and then it will be _work_, my brave,\r\nfor you and me. Come, let us have breakfast. We’ll have little enough\r\ntime for meals once the anchor is down, for I intend to have the boat\r\nand gear across that island by sunset; then to-morrow morning the real\r\nbusiness will begin.”\r\n\r\nThey passed into the deck-house, where the cook was already laying the\r\ntable, and were soon seated opposite to one another before a dish of\r\nbananas fried with bacon and a can of hot coffee.\r\n\r\nThey talked as they ate, and laughed. Sagesse, in the highest spirits,\r\nsketched out his plan of campaign, and Gaspard could not but admire the\r\nthoroughness of the man, for he had forgotten nothing, and had thought\r\nout the whole business to the minutest detail. Not only had a boat to\r\nbe fetched across the island to the lagoon and the pump and gear to\r\nfix in the boat, but a shelter had to be built in which to keep the\r\ndiving-dresses and the perishable rubber connections from the sun when\r\nnot in use.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Sagesse, “this may be a job of weeks, and we must land\r\nenough food for the working party right off, so as not to be making\r\njourneys to the vessel. There is water, you say?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is a spring.”\r\n\r\n“You told me you left a tent.”\r\n\r\n“A boat sail we made a tent of.”\r\n\r\n“It will do.”\r\n\r\n“Listen!” said Gaspard, suddenly turning his head and half rising to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nThrough the open doorway of the deck-house thin, faint, far away, came\r\na lamentable sound.\r\n\r\nIt was the crying of gulls.\r\n\r\nThe men rose from the table and came out on deck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE LANDING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island, close to them now and on the starboard bow, lay burning\r\ncoral-white and sage-green on the blue sea.\r\n\r\nOne could see the palms bending to the breeze, and the snow of the surf\r\nand the white flicker of the gulls, whose voices came, now and then,\r\nweak and spirit-like, across the water.\r\n\r\nSomething fluttering beneath the palms drew Gaspard’s attention; he\r\nborrowed Sagesse’s glass and looked. It was the remains of the tent,\r\na few rags of canvas; they seemed beckoning to him like brown hands,\r\nskeleton-thin and sinister.\r\n\r\nEven as he looked, the roar of the anchor-chain through the hawse pipe\r\ntore the air, and _La Belle Arlésienne_ swung at her moorings in eight\r\nfathoms of water a few cable-lengths from the shore.\r\n\r\nThe barquentine had come in with scarcely a sound, but scarcely had she\r\ntaken anchorage than Babel broke out on board. The voice of Jules could\r\nbe heard above the others, ordering the boats to be got ready; stores\r\nwere being brought on deck, whilst Sagesse, silent beside Gaspard,\r\nwatched the preparations for landing with a brooding eye, throwing in a\r\ncommand now and then.\r\n\r\nThe longboat and a quarterboat were lowered and laden with stores and\r\nthe diving apparatus; it was nearly an hour before the business was\r\ncomplete and Sagesse and his companion, taking their places in the\r\nstern of the longboat, found themselves free of _La Belle Arlésienne_\r\nand making for the shore.\r\n\r\nThey rowed to the southern beach.\r\n\r\n“I will take the quarterboat across the island,” said Sagesse. “It\r\nwill be a bit of a job, but she’s light enough, and eight of the hands\r\nwill be able to do it. I’m going to use her for the diving. _Mordieu_,\r\nbut it’s a desolate place, this island of yours. There’s no gainsaying\r\nthat. Who would ever think there was a ship sunk here, and lying in\r\nshallow water, too?”\r\n\r\n“It’s lonely enough,” said Gaspard, his eyes fixed on the white beach,\r\nthe palms, and the grey-green stretch of bay-cedar bushes. Now that he\r\nwas close in shore, all the elation of the treasure hunt had passed\r\nfrom him, giving place to a feeling of melancholy. Oh, those palms,\r\nthat rag of tent fluttering in the wind, that scorching splash of\r\nsunlight on the beach—what visions of desolation did they not call up!\r\nThe place seemed to him full of death and tragedy, repellant, as though\r\nthe shade of Simon Serpente were walking in the sun-blaze of the beach,\r\nas though the voices of the gulls were the voices of his men; ghosts of\r\nold buccaneers condemned to eternal restlessness and discontent.\r\n\r\nBut with the grounding of the boat’s nose on the sand all this passed\r\naway. He flung himself over the side and helped to run her up as far\r\non the beach as the weight of her cargo would let them pull her; the\r\nquarterboat was beached just beside her, and then the unlading began.\r\n\r\nWhilst it was still in progress Sagesse, leaving Jules to superintend,\r\ntook Gaspard’s arm.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he, “let’s have a look at her. The tide’s half out and she\r\nought to show up well.”\r\n\r\n“This way,” said Gaspard.\r\n\r\nHe led his companion amidst the bushes, avoiding the spot where he\r\nknew, face down amidst the bay cedars, the body of Yves was lying;\r\nhe dared not even look twice towards the place, and he breathed more\r\nfreely when they had passed it.\r\n\r\nThe line he took would also lead them twenty yards or so to westward of\r\nthe mound beside which Yves had discovered the belt and pouch and the\r\nskeleton to which they belonged.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they were free of the bushes and on the northern beach.\r\n\r\nThe tide was more than half out and the whole of the encircling reef\r\nof the lagoon was visible. Gaspard led the way on to the reef, then\r\nalong it, till he reached the spot opposite the foretop, weed-grown and\r\nprojecting from the water.\r\n\r\n“Look,” said he, pointing into the lagoon.\r\n\r\nSagesse without a word, stared down at the vision beneath him.\r\n\r\nIt was a part of the mystery of the sea that the lagoon water changed\r\nin brilliancy and clarity with the tide; with a flooding tide, and at\r\nfull, its diamond brightness dimmed almost imperceptibly and brightened\r\nalmost imperceptibly with the ebb. One would not have noticed the fact\r\nbut for the submerged ship and her crust of coral jewellery; which\r\nshewed brighter or dimmer according to the clarity of the water.\r\n\r\nPossibly outside the lagoon the sea floor held some clay that misted\r\nalmost imperceptibly the incoming water—who knows?—but the fact\r\nremained that at half-tide of the ebb she was more brilliantly defined\r\nthan at half-tide of the full—as to-day.\r\n\r\nGaspard, as he stood beside Sagesse, looking also, followed with his\r\neyes the fish-like form and the trend of the bulked-out bulwarks.\r\nAt the sight of her and the thought of the diving apparatus and all\r\nthe tackle for salving, the treasure-fever was on him again, hot and\r\nstrong. _Mordieu!_ when she was broken open, what might they not find?\r\n\r\nHe turned from her to Sagesse, expecting to read his own eagerness in\r\nthe Captain’s face, but the face of Sagesse shewed nothing.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Gaspard, “what do you think of her?”\r\n\r\nSagesse did not seem to hear the remark; he seemed plunged in thought.\r\n\r\nThen he spat into the water and turned back along the reef to the\r\nshore. Gaspard followed him.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you think of her?”\r\n\r\n“What do I think? _Ma foi!_ I think she was sunk at her moorings.”\r\n\r\nThere was a note of gloom in his tone.\r\n\r\n“You think she was not wrecked?”\r\n\r\n“She’s lying on too even a keel; she’s lying by that reef just as a\r\nship would lie if scuttled at her moorings.”\r\n\r\n“But, see here, if she was moored in that basin, she must have entered\r\nit, and there is no opening to admit a ship.”\r\n\r\n“Not now—but eighty or so years ago there was likely an opening,\r\nand that place was a kind of harbour. Serpente would have used that\r\nharbour.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Gaspard, “why should he have scuttled his ship?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, why?—who knows? We know he was chased; we know he had a cargo of\r\nslaves, and a crew each man of whom was a witness against him. He may\r\nhave kept a boat provisioned and moored to the ship’s side; then, at\r\nnight, with a confederate, battened the hatches, main and fo’cs’le,\r\nscuttled her, and made for the American coast in the boat—see?”\r\n\r\nSagesse seemed to have worked out the whole question in his dark mind\r\nand seemed deeply dissatisfied with the solution arrived at.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Gaspard, “how about those bones we found, that skull?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the skull! He may have been killed in turn, and robbed of his\r\ntreasure by his confederate,—who knows? there are a hundred ways of\r\nmaking skulls in a job like that. Only I say this: I lay a hundred to\r\none, if he scuttled his ship, he didn’t scuttle her with the money on\r\nboard.”\r\n\r\n“Then it’s a hundred to one we will find nothing.”\r\n\r\n“I said it was a hundred to one if he scuttled her the money wasn’t on\r\nboard. I don’t know whether he scuttled her or not; I’m only supposing\r\nthat he did it. No, the chances are not so bad as that, but they aren’t\r\nas good as I thought. But—”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t smell money there. It may be stupidity, it may be I don’t know\r\nwhat, but when there’s money in a thing I seem to know it. I don’t seem\r\nto feel there is money on that ship.”\r\n\r\nThey were returning not by the path through the bushes, but by the\r\neastern beach. From their left came the crying of the gulls, from their\r\nright the cries and shouts of the negroes unlading the last of the\r\nboat’s cargo.\r\n\r\nThe diving apparatus was already ashore, under shelter of a sail\r\nstretched between two of the palms; the white sand was strewn with\r\npackages and boxes. Sagesse, who thought of everything, was going to\r\nrun no risks; provisions for three months for the shore party were\r\nbeing landed, for there was always the chance of the vessel being blown\r\noff the island and leaving the shore party marooned.\r\n\r\nNot only had stores to be landed, but a tent had to be erected to\r\nprotect them from the sun. This was now being put up.\r\n\r\nTwo of the crew with cutlasses were slashing a path through the bushes\r\nfor the men who would have to carry the boat to the lagoon.\r\n\r\nAs Gaspard and Sagesse watched the busy crowd, Sagesse drew a cigar\r\nfrom his pocket and lit it. Gaspard searched for his pipe in his\r\npocket, found it and filled it; but before he could strike a light a\r\nhorrible thing happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE SKULLS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the negroes, working amidst the bushes, gave a cry, stooped,\r\npicked up something, and held it aloft. It was a skull.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_” said Sagesse, taking the arm of Gaspard and leading him\r\ntowards the spot where the negro stood with the skull still raised in\r\nair. “Skeleton Island, as you once called this place, does not seem\r\namiss as a name.”\r\n\r\nGaspard, pale to the lips, did not answer. He advanced alongside of\r\nSagesse; he dared not draw back or shew emotion, as the whole of the\r\nlanding party were trooping around to see what was amidst the bushes.\r\nBesides, he had killed Yves accidentally, so he told himself. Why\r\nshould he falter at the sight of his bones?\r\n\r\nBut no logic could veil the horror of the thing. To see before you the\r\nskull of a man to whom you have talked, with whom you have worked side\r\nby side, with whom you have jested, and to know that the skull is your\r\nhandiwork, your terrible _chef-d’oeuvre_, that but for you it would be\r\nclothed in flesh and filled with soul; that is the most tragic sight on\r\nwhich the gaze of man can fall.\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu!_” said Sagesse, taking the thing from the hands of the\r\nnegro. “This must then be the skull of the man who landed here with you\r\nand whom you left dead—what was his name, do you say?”\r\n\r\n“Yves.”\r\n\r\n“_Ah, oui_, Yves—” He stirred amidst the bushes with his foot. “And\r\nhere are Monsieur Yves’ bones. He has soon become a skeleton, Monsieur\r\nYves, but I have seen a man become a skeleton in the tropics in a week.\r\nThe crabs, the larvae, the sun, all help in the work.” He stooped down\r\nand picked up a tobacco-box and a seaman’s belt with knife attached.\r\n\r\n“Why, what is this? He had not drawn his knife!”\r\n\r\n“He had drawn it,” said Gaspard, “but I picked it up and put it back in\r\nits sheath.”\r\n\r\nThe onlookers knew nothing of the tragedy under these words, or of\r\nthe veiled accusation in the words of Sagesse; but they noticed that\r\nGaspard was shivering like a man with ague.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Sagesse, “we will keep the belt and knife as mementoes of\r\nMonsieur Yves. Here, Jules, take them back to the ship with you when\r\nyou go, and get a spade and dig a hole in the sand for these bones.”\r\n\r\nHe turned away, and the men resumed the work of unlading and storing\r\nthe provisions and gear. By eight bells, noon, everything was\r\ncompleted; the quarterboat was dragged up high on the beach and ready\r\nfor carting across the islet, and the hands knocked off for dinner.\r\nSagesse and Gaspard ate apart from the others, under the shade of a\r\nsail that had been especially rigged for them and would form their\r\ntent at night. The white sand near the bushes shewed traces of having\r\nbeen turned over with a spade where the bones of Yves had been buried.\r\nGaspard saw the place, but he did not mind—the treasure-fever had\r\ncast everything else to a distance; things seemed strange that\r\nwere familiar; he had forgotten Sagesse’s disheartening words; his\r\nimagination saw the sands covered with bags of dollars and bullion\r\ncases; he laughed as he ate. But Sagesse did not laugh, scarcely spoke,\r\nand when the meal was over, drew a cigar from his pocket and lit it.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting in the shadow of the canvas; the sands and the blue sea\r\nlay before him. On the sand just before the tent the palm-top shadows\r\nwere beginning to crawl—it was one o’clock.\r\n\r\nAs he sat like this, listening to the chanty of the negroes, who were\r\nbeginning to haul the boat across the island, of a sudden he made an\r\nexclamation and struck his knee with his hand.\r\n\r\nAn idea had evidently occurred to him. He called to Gaspard, who had\r\nrisen and was walking up and down on the sand outside.\r\n\r\nGaspard approached.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “what is it?”\r\n\r\n“An idea,” said the Captain. “We have come here, but we have not\r\nobserved etiquette.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, what do you say?” asked Gaspard, who had heard the word in the\r\ncourse of his life, but did not know the meaning.\r\n\r\n“We have not called on the proprietor of the place.”\r\n\r\n“The proprietor?”\r\n\r\n“Simon Serpente.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I had forgotten.”\r\n\r\nSagesse rose to his feet and took Gaspard’s arm.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he, “let’s go and hunt for the gentleman’s remains. It\r\nwould be curious, at all events, to see them. You know where you saw\r\nthem last?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” replied Gaspard, leading the way across the bushes.\r\n\r\nThe boat was being hauled along on rollers over a path cut through\r\nthe bushes, and the pulley-haul chanty of the negroes crossed with the\r\ncrying of the gulls:\r\n\r\n    “_A Fort de France. Ay ho!\r\n    A Fort de France. Ay ho!_”\r\n\r\nand from the gulls, wearily on the wind:\r\n\r\n  “Yves—Yves—Yves!”\r\n\r\n“It was near here,” said Gaspard.\r\n\r\nThey had come to the little rise in the ground amidst the bushes, and\r\nsure enough his foot, taking its next step forward, struck something\r\nhard and hollow.\r\n\r\nHe bent down and picked it up. It was the skull which was unlike any\r\nother skull, either of man or beast.\r\n\r\nSagesse held the thing in his hand for a moment as he glanced round\r\nhim. At his feet, dimly through the branches of the bay-cedar bushes,\r\nhe could see the bones of Serpente shining white, half revealed, half\r\nhidden.\r\n\r\nThen, flinging the skull into the air and catching it again, he burst\r\ninto a fit of laughter. In a trice his depression had vanished.\r\n\r\n_“Mordieu!”_ said Gaspard, “you seem pleased.” “Perhaps. It is as if\r\nthis thing had said to me, ‘You are wrong. The treasure is on board the\r\nship. Stretch out your hand, my friend, and take it.’”\r\n\r\nHe cast the skull amidst the bushes and turned to superintend the\r\nnegroes hauling the boat to the northern beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nSAGESSE IS CORNERED\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night, as they sat in the tent smoking, Gaspard approached the\r\nobject of his grievance.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” he said, “we have got the boat across the island and\r\nafloat in the lagoon. We have got the diving apparatus in her ready for\r\nworking. Nothing remains to be done but start work to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, before we start work, I have a word to say.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“It’s about the terms of our agreement.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“I am to have fifteen francs out of every hundred francs you make?”\r\n\r\n“Those were the terms.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it seems to me not enough.”\r\n\r\nSagesse gave a short laugh. “How, not enough?”\r\n\r\n“Who discovered the ship?”\r\n\r\n“Your friend, Yves—so you told me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but as a matter of fact, we both discovered it, for if he had not\r\ndone so I would have at the first low tide I was over there.”\r\n\r\n“Well, go on,” said Sagesse. “What are you driving at?”\r\n\r\n“I say fifteen per cent. is not enough. I want thirty.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you want thirty, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You want Monsieur Yves’ share as well as your own?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“That seems to me not unjust,” said Sagesse in a meditative tone.\r\n\r\n“I would not ask you if it were unjust.”\r\n\r\n“Yet, it seems to me,” said Sagesse, “that the conditions accompanying\r\nMonsieur Yves’ death make a difference. You killed this man, yet you\r\nwish to inherit his share. How about his relations?”\r\n\r\n“How about the relations of Pedro, whom you killed?” asked Gaspard.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” replied Sagesse. “You have me there, it seems; you have me\r\nin a corner, it seems. I have only been twice before in my life held up\r\nby obstacles. Now, do you not think it is a dangerous game to play with\r\nme, cornering me like that?” Sagesse’s voice had a complaining tone, as\r\nthough they were talking of some trifle.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Gaspard, with a smile, “I am armed.” He tapped the pocket\r\nwhere the revolver was.\r\n\r\nSagesse’s face took on an expression of disgust, almost.\r\n\r\n“Armed! Oh, you are only fit for the stokehold! Do you take me for a\r\nknifer or a Chinese hatchet man? Suppose I were to kill you to-night in\r\nyour sleep, what would happen? Every man on board who knew of it would\r\nbe my master. I don’t kill.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke the truth. Captain Sagesse, though he had killed Pedro\r\naccidentally, was no murderer. His art was quite beyond that rough\r\nmethod of settling disputes and gaining money.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Gaspard, “kill or not kill, I am not afraid. I am fighting\r\nfor my rights.”\r\n\r\n“And your rights you shall have.”\r\n\r\n“You will give me the thirty per cent.?”\r\n\r\nSagesse nodded his head.\r\n\r\n“Right,” said Gaspard, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\nSagesse took it.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said he, “let us forget our differences and have a drink.”\r\n\r\nHe brought out a case-bottle of rum from a corner of the tent and two\r\nmugs. They drank together, pledging each other, pledging Fortune,\r\nSerpente, the whole world. Then Gaspard, when the carouse had lasted\r\nsome two hours, lay down on his blanket and tapped his pipe out against\r\nhis heel. But he could not sleep for a long time, or if he slept, his\r\ndreams were so vivid as to be almost real happenings.\r\n\r\nMen passed before the tent entrance; they were carrying parcels and\r\npackages as though the landing party were returning to the ship. He\r\nheard Sagesse’s voice and the voice of Jules; he heard laughter and\r\nthen he heard no more, for slumber had suddenly shut on him like the\r\nlid of a box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING\r\n\r\n\r\nHe awoke not knowing in the least where he was; then he remembered.\r\n\r\nHis tongue felt huge in his mouth and his hands seemed the size of\r\npillows. He had felt all this before once, long ago, when a knock-out\r\ndrop had been put in his drink and he had been shanghaied. It was a\r\nfrightful sensation, for, added to it was the depression of the rum and\r\nthe knowledge that he had drunk to excess.\r\n\r\nAh! those nervous temperaments that liquor makes god-like for a moment\r\nof illusion, how they suffer face to face with their beastlikeness the\r\nmorning after!\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing—the faintest breath—through the open door of the\r\ntent, and the sea lay beyond the beach still and grey.\r\n\r\nThe sea that yesterday had been blue as sapphire had lost its blueness\r\nand beauty and lay grey and still, breaking on the beach in little\r\nripples. The sky above the sea was of a dull zinc colour, darker at the\r\nhorizon than at the zenith. Gaspard did not remember ever having seen a\r\ntropic sky like that, so still in its greyness, so steadfast, so gloomy.\r\n\r\nThrough the open door of the tent the wind carried with it the faintest\r\npowdering of dust. It irritated his eyes; he looked at his right\r\nhand—it was covered with grey dust. This was not sand from the beach;\r\nthis was dust, volcanic dust, grey and dismal. Some volcano of the\r\nislands was in eruption, some volcano down Martinique way, for the dust\r\nwas blown from that direction by the southeast trade wind.\r\n\r\nBut Gaspard knew nothing of volcanoes or their dust. He lay listening\r\nfor the voice of Sagesse. He had not yet recognized that a drug had\r\nbeen used against him the night before. He put everything down to the\r\ndrink, and felt ashamed to face his companion.\r\n\r\nHe lay listening. Not a sound except a slight pattering and scratching\r\nof the palm fronds as now and then they lifted to the faintest breath\r\nof air. Then what breeze there was died utterly away, and complete\r\nsilence held the island, broken now and then by the far-off crying of\r\nthe gulls.\r\n\r\nHe struggled to his feet, cursing the rum he had drunk the night\r\nbefore, and himself for having drunk it. Then he came tottering out\r\non to the beach. The first thing that struck his eye was the empty\r\nspace where last evening the pile of stores had stood, covered with\r\na sail-cloth. The stores had not been completely removed; a bag of\r\nbiscuits and a case of canned meat had been left.\r\n\r\nHis gaze travelled from these to the shore edge, where the longboat\r\nought to have been had the working party been ashore. It was not there.\r\nThen, flinging off his shoes and working his way a couple of yards up\r\nthe stem of a palm, he sought the western anchorage.\r\n\r\n_La Belle Arlésienne_ was gone.\r\n\r\nHe came down from the tree shaking and faint, the perspiration running\r\nfrom the palms of his hands and his lips dry as sandstone.\r\n\r\nHe was marooned. The thing was clear. Sagesse had doctored him the\r\nnight before with a knock-out drop; he had been “doped,” and as he lay\r\nunconscious the evasion had been made. But why? The answer was easy\r\nenough to find when one knew the character of Sagesse. To leave Gaspard\r\nalone on his island, knowing what he had suffered there before, would\r\nbe a piece of revenge after Sagesse’s heart; yet Gaspard felt this not\r\nto be the solution.\r\n\r\n_Why_ had Sagesse flown like this, leaving the ship of coral in the\r\nlagoon untouched? Had he, then, sure knowledge that the treasure was\r\nnot there, and that time would be wasted in looking for it? Trying to\r\nfind an answer to the riddle set him, and scarcely knowing where he\r\nwent, he took the path across the islet along which the quarterboat had\r\nbeen drawn to the lagoon.\r\n\r\nEven before he reached the northern beach two things struck his eye;\r\nthe quarterboat, with all the diving apparatus on board, lay floating\r\nin the lagoon and moored to the eastern edge of the basin; and far out\r\nat sea _La Belle Arlésienne_ with all sail set lay becalmed.\r\n\r\nOut there on the desolate grey of the calm sea, her old sails\r\nhanging flaccid and without a motion, _La Belle Arlésienne_ had an\r\ninexpressibly lugubrious and sinister appearance.\r\n\r\nIt was as though she had been caught in some wicked act and, trying\r\nto escape, had been arrested. The calm was holding her in a grip as\r\npowerful as the iron grip of ice; the south equatorial current, broken\r\nhere, would not give her a drift of more than a mile an hour to the\r\nnorth. She might hang in sight of the island for a day or more.\r\n\r\nGaspard, standing on the reef, shook his fist at her and cursed her,\r\nand her captain and crew. He remembered the very first day he had seen\r\nher, and how, working himself up into a nervous fever of imagination,\r\nhe had fancied her passing without seeing him and had cursed her and\r\nher captain and her crew.\r\n\r\nShe had taken him from the island and had brought him back; on board of\r\nher he had given himself away to Sagesse under the influence of rum.\r\nShe had brought him to Martinique, she had given him Marie and the\r\nhope of a happy future—and she had taken them away again. She was an\r\nevil thing, and he cursed her again as he stared across the sea, not\r\nnoticing that through the air, upon his clothes, upon the reef, upon\r\nthe bay-cedar bushes behind him, the almost impalpable grey dust was\r\nstill falling.\r\n\r\nThe wind had utterly ceased and a candle would have burnt without a\r\nflicker in that motionless air. Gaspard had no idea of the time of day,\r\nfor the light came through the clouded sky evenly diffused as light\r\ncomes through a scuttle of ground glass.\r\n\r\nHe turned his eyes from the distant vessel to the boat floating on the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\n_Why_ had Sagesse abandoned the boat and the valuable diving apparatus?\r\nSagesse of all men in the world, Sagesse, who turned over a half-penny\r\ntwice before he parted with it! The boat and gear were worth a very\r\nconsiderable sum, and here they were—thrown away.\r\n\r\nHe turned from the beach and began to re-cross the islet.\r\n\r\nHalfway across, at the spot where yesterday he had shewn Sagesse the\r\nskull of Serpente, he stopped dead, flung up his arms, and cried out as\r\nthough he had been shot.\r\n\r\nThe little mound beside which Yves had found the bones of Serpente and\r\nthe pouch of gold was no longer there; in its place there was a cavity\r\nabout six feet long and four wide and five deep.\r\n\r\nHe saw it all at once in one blinding flash. Serpente’s treasure had\r\nnever been on board that ship. It had been here safely cached, and\r\nSerpente had died and left his bones beside it.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious now; the mound of earth, the ship sunk in the lagoon,\r\nthe bones bleaching beside the mound; yet he had never seen a glimpse\r\nof it at all, whereas Sagesse, at the first sight of the ship, had\r\nsmelt the truth; Sagesse at sight of the mound had known almost as a\r\nfact that the treasure of Serpente lay there. He recalled how Sagesse\r\nhad laughed as he flung the skull away into the bushes; he recalled how\r\nlast night he had demanded thirty per cent. of the findings, and how\r\nSagesse had given in and agreed to his demand. Then, while he, Gaspard,\r\ndrugged and asleep, lay snoring in his tent, Sagesse, with Jules\r\nperhaps to help him, came here, dug, found what they sought, collected\r\ntheir men, collected their stores, rowed to _La Belle Arlésienne_,\r\nup-anchored, and sailed away north for the American coast.\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Gaspard’s face as he thought of this, Sagesse’s\r\nwords, spoken in the café of the Rue Victor Hugo, came back to him. “It\r\nis men like you who fill stokeholds.” Yes, he belonged to the race of\r\nmen who cannot see, the inefficient men who fill stokeholds, the men\r\nwithout worldly wisdom and insight, who do the work of the world with\r\ntheir hands, while the sharpers and scoundrels and business men take\r\nthe profits.\r\n\r\nHe flung himself on his knees by the hole and looked into it. At the\r\nbottom something caught his eye, and, leaping down, he picked it up. It\r\nwas a coin, heavy, battered, and almost soot-black. He bit it, and the\r\ntiny dint of the toothmark showed yellow. It was gold.\r\n\r\nHe dragged himself up amid the bushes, and with the coin in his hand\r\nstood looking away at the sea, where _La Belle Arlésienne_ lay becalmed.\r\n\r\nA wild idea occurred to him of trying to reach her with the quarterboat\r\nthat was lying in the lagoon. Impossible. There were no oars, the heavy\r\ndiving pump was fixed on board her firmly, he had no tools to remove\r\nit with, and even at high tide, when the sea edge of the reef was\r\nsubmerged, he doubted if she could be got across it.\r\n\r\nAs he stood like this, the sea, which had been breaking in tiny waves,\r\nthe still grey sea that seemed asleep, suddenly gave a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nA glassy roller, stealthy as a thief, had stolen shoreward from the\r\nnorth and broken upon the reef. Gaspard turned his eyes from _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_, caught a glimpse of something in the sky to westward,\r\nshaded his eyes and looked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nDISASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nA smoke-coloured band, curious, and like a thin curved cloud, cut the\r\ngrey background of sky to eastward. It was in motion. Even as he looked\r\nit changed subtly in shape till now it became a comet of smoke, head\r\npointing to the island.\r\n\r\nFar away to the northeast, another band of smoke, grey and also in\r\nmotion, caught his eye.\r\n\r\nThere was something sinister in these apparitions so strange to the\r\neye, so perplexing to the mind, so dismal in colour against the dismal\r\ngrey of the sky.\r\n\r\nWhat could they be?\r\n\r\nThe coin he held in his hand was forgotten; unconsciously he put it in\r\nhis pocket and, folding his arms, looked.\r\n\r\nNow the approaching comet of smoke altered again in form, becoming a\r\nline definite, distinct, and swiftly approaching like an apparition in\r\na dream.\r\n\r\nAh! what was that—that voice mournful and complaining? In a flash the\r\nmeaning of the phenomenon was revealed. They were birds. A vast flock\r\nof gulls, thousands, beating the air as with one wing, crying aloud as\r\nwith one voice; then silent, always advancing.\r\n\r\nAnd now the gulls of the island rose clamouring, like a burst of smoke;\r\nin a moment the air was filled with birds, in a moment the oncomers\r\nhad joined the island birds, in a moment, all rising as if by common\r\nconsent, the feathered thousands took definite form and encircled the\r\nisland in a vast moving ring.\r\n\r\nThe “hush” of their wings sounded like the continuous beating of the\r\nsea on the shore.\r\n\r\nGaspard, with head upturned, gazing at the wonderful sight, saw the\r\nsecond flight approaching. It joined the others, circled with them,\r\nand then, just as if the moving ring had been bent by a wind, it broke\r\nand in two vast flocks the moving host passed away to westward, became\r\nclouds again, and slowly vanished, leaving the island to silence and\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nThere was something tragic in this great migration of birds and in\r\nthe utter silence that followed their vanishing. There was something\r\ndisturbing in the absolute peace which had taken the whole world into\r\nits keeping.\r\n\r\nClose to Gaspard, caught in the branches of the bay-cedar bushes, lay\r\nsomething white. As he turned his eyes from the western horizon, whence\r\nthe great flock had vanished, his eyes caught this white thing, and he\r\napproached it. It was the skull of Serpente, thrown away by Sagesse,\r\nnow grinning at the grey sky as though reading there some frightful\r\njoke, some diabolical secret of Nature.\r\n\r\nGaspard turned his eyes from this thing to the distant vessel, caught\r\nin its flight, arrested and held in bondage by the calm. One might have\r\nfancied that the grinning skull drew its mirth from the predicament of\r\nSagesse. To Gaspard it seemed that the skull was the centre from which\r\nall that silence and desolation of sea and sky radiated, the _quid\r\nobscurum_ at the heart of that peace which was holding the world in its\r\nspell.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the southern beach and sought the tent. As he entered it\r\nand lay down to rest his aching head, the sea again, moving uneasily,\r\nboomed on the reef to northward and sighed on the sand of the southern\r\nbeach. The unrest, the unhappiness that lives in the heart of things,\r\nseemed to speak in that voice.\r\n\r\nHe turned as he lay and cast himself face downwards with arms\r\noutstretched. Tricked, betrayed, marooned, robbed of the gold for which\r\nhe had forgotten her, he remembered now Marie. Sagesse, the treasure,\r\n_La Belle Arlésienne_, all that trash vanished from his mind for a\r\nmoment before the vision of the thing he loved.\r\n\r\nHad there been the slightest chance of outwitting Sagesse, of regaining\r\nhis hold upon the treasure, the fever for revenge and gold would have\r\nheld his mind from all else; but he recognized that the game was lost,\r\nand in his desolation he turned to his only thought of comfort. And\r\nhere again the game was lost. Love had tricked him just as fortune had\r\ntricked him, and just as cruelly.\r\n\r\nTo find Marie again he must first find Martinique. Suppose, even, that\r\na ship were to rescue him; that ship might be bound for any port in\r\nthe world but Martinique. He had no money, no trade. To gain enough\r\nto return to St. Pierre he would have to go back to the stokehold,\r\nhe would have to work ships across and across the world before his\r\nwretched pay, saved and scraped together, would give him money\r\nsufficient to return with. He might write to M. Seguin, but where in\r\nhis wandering life would he get the reply?\r\n\r\nIt might be months before a ship rescued him; it might be months before\r\nthat ship landed him at a port where he could get work; it might be\r\nyears before he reached Martinique—and meanwhile, what of Marie? Ah!\r\nthe want of money, just a little of that money which the rich find\r\nso burdensome, that want is the curse of the poor, that want is the\r\nessence of the true tragedy of life.\r\n\r\nThe hunger which poverty imposes on man is nothing to the loneliness\r\nand the separation, the heart-break and the starvation for want of love.\r\n\r\nHe loved Marie now, with the love that comes after marriage, the love\r\nthat has nothing to do with passion. Across separation and disaster\r\nhe saw her as she really was, beautiful, single-hearted, loving, and\r\nfaithful—and he might never meet her again. To reach her he would have\r\nto journey to all parts of the world, working as a slave in a stokehold\r\nwith that ache in his heart, earning _sou_ by _sou_, the money that\r\nwould bring him to her—and every moment of separation seemed a year.\r\n\r\nStung suddenly to madness, with the tears upon his face, he left the\r\ntent and sought the beach outside, walking up and down it like a\r\nfrenzied creature, cursing, calling out, wild with the petty things\r\nthat had him in their grip, the little Fates that had bound him to this\r\nislet as the Lilliputians bound Gulliver. He saw nothing of his own\r\nhandiwork in this fate which he cursed; he saw nothing of the grave\r\nfaults of mind, the weaknesses, the impetuosities that had flawed his\r\nlife, killing Yves, and binding him to the will of Sagesse; he only saw\r\nhis Fate and that it was horrid—and he cursed it.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile he paused. A wind had risen and was blowing from the north\r\nacross the islet. He recognised that the day had grown suddenly darker\r\nand as he stood wiping the sweat from his brow, confused, and exhausted\r\nwith the conflict of thought through which he had passed, he heard a\r\nnoise, faint, far away, and indeterminate. It came from the north with\r\nthe wind that was now increasing in force. He glanced round at the sky.\r\nAll the northern sky was dusky, like hot bronze; it had a solid look,\r\nand even as he gazed some wind of the higher atmosphere set to work\r\ncompacting the upper part of this dark zone, ruling it level in one\r\ninfinite line. Added to the darkness of the coming storm was the dusk\r\nof evening. The drug must have held him in its spell much longer than\r\nhe had thought.\r\n\r\nNext moment Gaspard was making across the islet to the northern beach;\r\nwhen he reached it he stopped, shaded his eyes with both hands, and\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\n_La Belle Arlésienne_ had got the wind at last. She shewed as if\r\nsketched in grey chalk against the great black wall that the coming\r\nstorm had built across the world. Heavens! what a sight was that wall!\r\nIt seemed built by plumb-line and square, titanic, immeasurable.\r\n\r\nAnd from behind it came that sound, growing momently more definite, as\r\nthough all the hosts of darkness were murmuring together, wild to break\r\nthrough some hidden door and burst upon the world.\r\n\r\nAgainst this prodigious menace _La Belle Arlésienne_ was moving,\r\nsteering N.N.East on the starboard tack. Sagesse had taken in sail, but\r\nin the face of what was coming, not enough, to a sailor’s eye. But no\r\none knew better than Sagesse that all to southward of him the sea was\r\nfull of death, in the form of rocks and shoals; to make an offing was\r\nimperative.\r\n\r\nNow the wind was coming in gusts, whipping the foam over the reef, and\r\nthe spray in the face of Gaspard, and before the wind the league-long\r\nwaves were racing shoreward.\r\n\r\nAs he looked, as he listened, the great wall seemed gradually to bend\r\nfrom the top and over it came the rushing wind, and with the wind the\r\nfirst note of thunder, profound, funereal, and dreamy; less like\r\nthunder than the muffle of muffled drums.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the setting sun, pale like an appalled spectator,\r\nglanced through the clouds, lit the sea, _La Belle Arlésienne_ and\r\nthe advancing wall of storm. It was no longer a wall; it had become\r\nconcave, in the form of a breaking wave, and the wave became veiled\r\nwith mist, and _La Belle Arlésienne_ blotted out behind the roaring\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nDominating the thunder, the wind, the howling of the storm, the voice\r\nof the rain tore the air as it washed over the sea and then over the\r\nislet, wave-like and solid almost as a wave. It cast Gaspard down\r\nlike a great hand and held him half drowned; it released him for half\r\na second and before he could struggle to his feet the wind hit him\r\nand drove him like a rag amidst the bushes, and the sand of the beach\r\nrushed over him, not as sand but slush, half choking him. He thought\r\nthe waves of the sea were upon him, but there were now no waves on the\r\nsea, which was as smooth beneath the wind as a new planed board, and as\r\nwhite as driven snow.\r\n\r\nOn his face, now, struggling to rise, he could not; it was as though\r\na great sheet of iron held him down, and with the first real crash\r\nof thunder, prone on his face, he felt the earth splitting under him\r\nand shouted to the mud beneath him, “The world is gone—the world is\r\ngone!” But the world held fast though now, blow after blow, the gods\r\nseemed smashing at it with mighty hammers, sickening concussions, jets\r\nof light, deafness, blackness, misery, and the iron hand of the wind,\r\nall had fallen upon the world, rending thought to pieces. It could have\r\nlasted but a minute, this first desperate onslaught of the hurricane,\r\nyet to Gaspard it seemed that time had been torn away by the wind, that\r\nhe had known eternity.\r\n\r\nNow, released partly from the grip of that hateful hand which had\r\npressed him nearly to death, he struggled to his knees and crawled\r\nfurther amidst the bushes where they were thickest; here there was\r\nshelter of a sort, the bushes low-growing and firm-rooted made a\r\nbulwark against the wind and the spindrift rushing across the island\r\nlike blown white sheets. Again and again the yelling blackness would\r\nbe lit by the lightning and the whirling spirals and blankets of spray\r\nabove shown up only to vanish in the roaring darkness where the world\r\nseemed fighting for its life with chaos.\r\n\r\nThen came stupor; like a man half under the influence of chloroform\r\nthe man amidst the bushes, deafened, and blinded and stupefied by\r\nthe torment around him, saw visions, and dreamt dreams in which the\r\nblinding lightning flashes lit blue seas and the voice of the wind was\r\nthe voices of people.\r\n\r\nHow long he lay like this it would be impossible to say before raising\r\nhimself on his elbow, he returned fully to consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe great fury of the hurricane had passed; it was still blowing hard\r\nand strong, but the worst was over and the moon was lighting the world\r\nthrough the rushing clouds. He rose to his feet, but fell on his knees\r\nagain immediately. He had eaten nothing during the past twenty-four\r\nhours, and the drug was still weakening him; but in the moment of\r\nrising he had seen a sight surpassing in terror even the fury of the\r\nhurricane, and now amidst the bushes, on hands and knees, motionless\r\nand petrified by the drama before him, he looked.\r\n\r\n_La Belle Arlésienne_ was coming ashore, now uplifted on the crest of\r\na wave, now vanishing in a hollow, dismasted all but for the stump of\r\nthe foremast, from which a rag of canvas was wildly flying. _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_ was being driven to the lagoon by the merciless whip of the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThe hag of the sea had found her master at last; stealth and cunning\r\ncould not save her now, nor trickery, nor subterfuge. She had flung\r\nthem all away. Like some witch who had worked evil long in silence,\r\ndragged at last shrieking to the gallows, the old barquentine seemed\r\nfighting against her fate.\r\n\r\nHer fluttering rags of canvas seemed clawing at the wind; she screamed,\r\nand Gaspard on his knees could hear her screams in the high-pitched\r\nwailing of her crew, the shrill pig-like screaming of negroes hurled\r\nand huddled together, animals waiting for inevitable death.\r\n\r\nA moment he saw her held up strong in the moonlight on the crest of\r\na vast wave; then a cloud drew a skirt of shadow over her and when\r\nthe moon broke through again she was gone, deep in the pocket of the\r\nlagoon, over which the thirty-foot waves were rushing shoreward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nTHE PASSING OF SAGESSE\r\n\r\n\r\nHe must have fallen asleep as he knelt, for when he regained\r\nconsciousness he had no memory of having lain down. Yet he was lying on\r\nhis side amidst the bushes, the day was broad, the sun shining, the sky\r\nwithout a cloud, though still swept by the rushing wind.\r\n\r\nHe remembered all that had passed clearly and distinctly and the\r\nmiracle of that blue sky above him, after the black and howling chaos\r\nof the night, filled his heart with thankfulness untold.\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet. His clothes were stiff with sea-salt, his eyes\r\nhalf-blinded by the light. Then he cried out in astonishment. The\r\nisland, under the sun, and surrounded by the racing amethyst of the\r\nsea, lay glittering white as frost. It was sea-salt from the spray\r\nof the night before. The palm trees were no longer there. There was\r\nnothing to be seen but the winter-white bushes beneath the burning sun.\r\nBodies were washing ashore on the beach close to him, but he scarcely\r\nglanced at them, the desolation before him held him motionless and the\r\nknowledge that everything was blown away, provisions, tent, everything!\r\n\r\nHe crossed to the southern beach. There lay the palms, snapped off\r\nand dashed into the sand; a little mound just by the sea edge drew\r\nhim towards it; it was the case of provisions. Hurled along by the\r\nwind, it had struck a lump of coral and been sanded over; it had been\r\nshaken almost to pieces and a few blows with his heel burst the staves\r\napart. It was packed with tins of American preserved meat, such as are\r\nexported especially to the West Indies. He haggled a tin open with his\r\nknife and set to on its contents. As he ate he saw something tangled in\r\nthe fronds of one of the broken palms. He came to it, kicked the sand\r\naside and found the bag of biscuit. Things were not, then, so bad; but\r\nhis mind was so dazed and benumbed that he scarcely felt satisfaction\r\nat the sight of the food and the knowledge that for a time, at least,\r\nhe was saved from starvation. He stood chewing the meat and gazing\r\nabout him, as an animal might gaze on finding itself in a strange place.\r\n\r\nEver since his first landing upon it with Yves, the island had seemed\r\npossessed of some diabolical presence. Yet on looking back, there was\r\nnothing to be perceived but just an ordinary and logical chain of\r\nevents. With the exception of finding the gold and the coral ship in\r\nthe lagoon, all the events, even the killing of Yves, came within the\r\nprovince of ordinary sequence. Yet how sinister were they, taken as\r\na whole, from the first glimpse of the ship in the water to the last\r\nglimpse of _La Belle Arlésienne_ hurled to her death by the waves.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking nothing of this as he stood chewing the food and gazing\r\nabout him. The satisfaction of his hunger was all that troubled him for\r\nthe moment; then he sought the little spring amidst the bushes, and\r\ndrank.\r\n\r\nHe had not eaten for more than twenty-four hours, and now the food he\r\nhad taken made him feel drowsy, heavy with weariness. He came to the\r\nblown-down palms, made what shelter he could from the sun with their\r\nfronds, lay down beside them and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke some hours later, his mind was clear and his first\r\nthought was of Sagesse. So strange a thing is the human mind that here,\r\ncast away, marooned on this desolate spot without a tent to shelter\r\nhim or a soul to share his loneliness, his first sensation on fully\r\nregaining his faculties was one of triumph. Sagesse had gone under,\r\nthat hateful mind, perfidious and dark, would trouble him no more. He\r\nwas revenged. He rose to his feet and shook the sand from his clothes.\r\nThe wind was still blowing strong, but the sea had fallen. The gulls\r\nhad not returned, and the only sounds in all that blue and breezy world\r\nwere the sounds of the wind and the breaking waves. The frost-white\r\nglitter of the bay-cedar bushes lent an extra touch of brilliancy to\r\nthe scene. Never had he seen the island like this, sea-dashed and\r\nwind-blown, surrounded with tumultuous life.\r\n\r\nHe crossed over to the northern beach. He wished to see what he could\r\nof the wreck, but even before he was half way across he could see that\r\nnothing remained of _La Belle Arlésienne_ but a few spars washing about\r\nin the lagoon water, where ship of wood and ship of coral lay locked\r\ntogether in ruin.\r\n\r\nBut things were washing ashore on the full tide—black things to\r\nmake one shudder, forms with limbs outspread, looking like enormous\r\njet-black starfish, forms locked together in a deadly embrace as though\r\nthey had gone to their death fighting.\r\n\r\nThen as Gaspard stepped from the bushes he saw with a thrill of horror\r\nthat the sands were in motion. Thousands upon thousands of little crabs\r\nwere congregating to the feast; he trod on them as he walked, and\r\namidst them, like moving rocks, giant crabs from the eastern beach were\r\nadvancing like captains of this army of destruction.\r\n\r\nHe would have fled the hateful place had he not noticed a form that\r\nthe sea had cast up almost free of the waves.\r\n\r\nIt was the body of Sagesse.\r\n\r\nThe man of wisdom and resource lay on his side, huddled up as if\r\nasleep. He was fully dressed. Horrible though the place was and\r\ndreadful with death, not all the horror in the world could have\r\nprevented Gaspard from advancing towards the body of Sagesse. It drew\r\nhim towards it against his will, as if by some mesmeric influence.\r\n\r\nThe right hand of the Captain lying across his chest had upon one of\r\nthe fingers something that glittered in the sun like a star. It was\r\na diamond, enormous and lovely with light, set in an old-fashioned\r\nring. It would have graced the crown of an emperor; it would have held\r\nGaspard fascinated had not another object held him breathless. From the\r\nmuffler around the neck of Sagesse protruded the head of a snake. Two\r\nbright red burning eyes flashed in the sun, the thing seemed furious\r\nat being disturbed; a moment more and one would have expected it to\r\nwriggle from its concealment and strike, but Gaspard feared it less\r\neven than he had feared the _fer de lance_ of the Place du Fort. He\r\nknelt down beside Sagesse, heedless of the crabs now surrounding him,\r\nremoved the muffler from his neck and then removed the snake. It was of\r\nsolid gold, flexible, one of those antique bracelets made to wind round\r\nand cling to a woman’s arm. The flat portion of the head was formed\r\nby a quadrille of flat sapphires, the eyes were pigeon-blood rubies.\r\nLeaving the extraordinary beauty of the workmanship aside, the stones\r\nalone were worth a little fortune.\r\n\r\nThen Gaspard knew that the captain had indeed found the treasure of\r\nSimon Serpente, and, seeing shipwreck before him, had sorted out the\r\nmost valuable things in a wild attempt to save them with his own\r\nwretched life. With the sweat breaking out on his forehead at the\r\npossibilities before him, he flung the serpent of gold on the ground\r\nbefore searching the body. It fell on the swarming crabs. He picked\r\nit up and flung it round his own neck. Then he noticed that his hand\r\nwas bleeding; it had been nipped by one of the vermin which were now\r\ncrawling up on the body of Sagesse, as the Lilliputians swarmed on\r\nGulliver. Seized with fury, he sprang to his feet and kicked the brutes\r\nhither and thither, stamped on them, crushed them. He might as well\r\nhave stamped on water advancing from an overflowing dam; the clicking\r\nand rustling hordes swarmed on.\r\n\r\nHe flung himself on his knees again beside the body, seized the hand\r\nwith the ring, drew the jewel off and put it in his pocket. He scarcely\r\nnoticed that a crab was clinging to the hand as he flung it aside. The\r\nleft coat pocket of Sagesse was bulging. He thrust his hand in and drew\r\nout a knotted handkerchief; it chinked like a bag of marbles, and from\r\na corner a piece of broken gold fell out. It was part of a brooch. He\r\ndid not stay to investigate further; the handkerchief held treasure.\r\nHe thrust it into his pocket and went on. There was a pocket-book in\r\nthe breast pocket of the coat, in the other pockets nothing of value.\r\nHe opened the waistcoat; he tore open the shirt; nothing more. Wiping\r\nthe sweat from his brow, he was about to rise to his feet when he\r\nremembered that he had not examined the left hand for rings.\r\n\r\nHe pushed the body over.\r\n\r\nThe left hand of Sagesse was closed tight on something. The _rigor\r\nmortis_ was just passing, and Gaspard had no difficulty in unlocking\r\nthe fingers from the treasure they contained. It was a pearl, a lovely\r\nmilk-white pearl, large almost as a pigeon’s egg. Why he had clung to\r\nthis thing especially, whether from superstition or not, who can say?\r\n\r\nOr was it a pearl not belonging to Serpente’s treasure at all? A pearl\r\nof the lagoon that by some extraordinary chance the drowning man\r\nhad seized upon unknowingly in his struggles? One might almost have\r\nimagined this to be the case, for this thing was virginal as the sea\r\nand had evidently never been set or worn by mortal.\r\n\r\nWho can say? But so the captain of _La Belle Arlésienne_ had gone to\r\nhis Maker, clasping this emblem of purity in his hand, almost a parable\r\non the mighty truth that each one of us, however evil, has yet, in his\r\nsoul, somewhere, a priceless pearl.\r\n\r\nThoughts that never occurred to Gaspard.\r\n\r\nHe had risen to his feet. In his pockets lay the plunder he had taken\r\nfrom Sagesse, in his hand the pearl, around his feet the crabs swarming\r\nto their prey.\r\n\r\nHe was rich.\r\n\r\nThe sea had given him the riches that other men toil their lives for,\r\ngiven it to him in one great glittering handful. He seemed standing\r\nbefore a blinding light. It seemed unthinkable that he who had striven\r\nall his life for a pittance, working now as a sailor before the\r\nmast, now as a slave in the blind alley of the stokehold, it seemed\r\nunthinkable that he should have drawn this tremendous and glittering\r\nprize.\r\n\r\nAs he stood in the blazing sunshine, the wind blowing his hair about\r\nhis eyes, his eyes staring, astonished, fixed, as though he were gazing\r\nat Fortune herself, a black shadow passed over him. It was the shadow\r\nof a cormorant.\r\n\r\nAway out across the waves other birds were coming to the feast; the\r\nwreck and the stranded corpses had been signalled for miles across the\r\nsea, for the sea, like the desert, has a watch-tower—the air, and a\r\nwatchman who never leaves that tower—eternal Hunger.\r\n\r\nThe bird cried as it wheeled and the cry brought Gaspard to his senses.\r\nHe glanced up, then down at the swarming beach; then, touching his\r\npocket to make sure that the contents were safe, he turned from the\r\nhorrors around him and made towards the southern beach, running.\r\n\r\nHe wished to be alone with his treasure. He shouted like a boy as he\r\nran, taking the road through the bushes that Serpente’s sailors had\r\ncut for the boat. The jewelled snake round his throat glittered and\r\nflashed; never was there a more extraordinary picture than this man,\r\nhalf ragged, his clothes stained with sea-salt, his hair blowing on the\r\nwind, the jewelled serpent around his neck, running and shouting as he\r\nran to the desolation around him, and with Fortune.\r\n\r\nAt the place where the palm trees lay prone on the sand he stopped, sat\r\ndown, took the serpent of gold from around his throat and placed it on\r\nthe sand beside him, and beside it the parcel.\r\n\r\nThen from his pocket he took the knotted handkerchief and the ring. He\r\nplaced the ring by the pearl and then he unknotted the handkerchief and\r\npoured the contents on the white sand between his legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTREASURE\r\n\r\n\r\nBroken bits of gold like the twigs from which jewelled fruit had been\r\ntorn, spinels, peridots, star sapphires, slab-shaped emeralds, cinnamon\r\nstones, a black pearl shaped like a pear, diamonds, an enormous\r\nturquoise _de la vieille roche_ sun-stricken, coloured, flashing, the\r\ntreasure of Simon Serpente lay before Gaspard, other treasure there\r\ndoubtless had been in coin and gold, but this was the cream of it,\r\nskimmed by Sagesse, selected no doubt during that calm behind which the\r\nsailor’s eye had seen the approaching hurricane.\r\n\r\nLoot from the towns of Spanish South America, from ships plundered and\r\nscuttled, from women and from altars, all lay here in a confusion of\r\ncolours. Some of these stones absolutely shouted of sacrilege, huge,\r\nand splendid, never could they have been worn as jewellery, except by\r\nemperors or by jewelled saints in the twilit and incense-laden air of\r\nsome cathedral. Gaspard knew little of precious stones, but a child or\r\na savage would have guessed the worth of this amazing collection of\r\ngems. For a moment after he had turned them out of the handkerchief,\r\nhis breath came in gasps like the breath of a person dashed with cold\r\nwater. He could not touch them for a moment, it was as though he were\r\nafraid of shattering an illusion. Then came the thought:\r\n\r\nThey are mine.\r\n\r\nHe curled his fingers, his lips drew back from his teeth, then he\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nThey are mine.\r\n\r\nHe banged his right hand, palm down on the sand beside him, then he\r\nclapped his knees with both hands, then, stretching out his hand he\r\nseized a wine-coloured amethyst. It was the least valuable stone of the\r\nlot, but it was lovely and it lay in his palm like a little lake of\r\ncolour. He felt its smoothness, turned it about, touched it with his\r\ntongue as if he wanted to taste its beauty as well as feel and see it.\r\n\r\nIt was his, all these things were his and as the thought came back to\r\nhim he sprang to his feet and with the amethyst in his left hand and\r\nhis right hand shading his eyes, he looked wildly around him.\r\n\r\nYes, he was alone, no one was watching him; no one was there to dispute\r\nhis possession; the wind blew and the bay-cedar bushes bent before\r\nthe wind, the sun shone, the sea burned blue and flashed beneath the\r\nsun. In all the island world there was no sign or sound of life save\r\nthe flickering wings of the cormorants on the northern beach and\r\noccasionally their cries.\r\n\r\nLoneliness no longer had terrors for him, the sight of a ship at this\r\nmoment would have flung him into consternation. He, the man who had\r\nflung himself face downward in the tent weeping at the thought that\r\nit might be months before a ship sighted the island and took him off\r\nto begin his long journey back to Martinique and Marie, would, had he\r\nsighted a sail at this moment, have cursed it.\r\n\r\nWith the knowledge of possession had come the fear of dispossession.\r\nHe had not forgotten Marie, he had not foregone his desire to return\r\nto Martinique, but in the first wonderful hours with his treasure, he\r\nwished to be alone, to feel it live under his hand, to make plans as\r\nto safe disposal, to dream for a while the wonderful dream of wealth\r\nhere, where there was nothing to disturb him but the gulls and the\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nBesides, why should he grieve about Marie now? There was nothing to\r\nstop him from reaching her, the road was clear before him once he\r\nwas free from the island, the least of those stones lying there in a\r\nglittering heap would give him his passage to Martinique from the ends\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nHe looked around at the far horizon—not a sail.\r\n\r\nAs he was standing thus with his hand in his left-hand pocket\r\ncontaining the pocket-book of Sagesse which he had not yet examined, he\r\nfelt something beside the pocket-book. A round, hard disc. It was the\r\ncoin he had picked out of the treasure pit. Rich as he was, this was\r\nthe only coin in his possession. Then, sitting down on the sand beside\r\nhis treasure, he began to sort the stones, arranging them in lines\r\naccording to their colour. Some were unset, others had still clinging\r\nto them some fragments of the settings from which they had been broken.\r\n\r\nThere were seven rubies, all of the true pigeon-blood colour, the least\r\nof these was as large as one’s little finger-nail, the three largest\r\nwere immense stones as big as the top of an ordinary man’s thumb above\r\na line drawn across the base of the nail; it is only in rubies of the\r\ntrue colour and of this great size that the splendour of precious\r\nstones finds its ultimate expression. There is nothing in the inanimate\r\nworld to approach them in magnificence and beauty.\r\n\r\nThere were seventeen emeralds, ten quite small and inconsiderable, and\r\nseven simply priceless, all save the largest, which was starred and\r\nflawed.\r\n\r\nHe arranged these beneath the rows of rubies. Then came the diamonds\r\nof which there were forty-eight, not counting the diamond in the ring\r\nlying where he had placed it by the jewelled snake. Some of these\r\ndiamonds still had the gold of their settings clinging to them, the six\r\nlargest were the size of hazel nuts and of perfect water. In any market\r\nof the world those six diamonds would have fetched thirty thousand\r\npounds and have given a huge profit to the buyer, seven were about half\r\nthe size of hazel nuts, but of these one was blue and it alone was a\r\nlittle fortune; of the thirty-five remaining three were sherry-coloured\r\nand the remainder pure white.\r\n\r\nThe great turquoise had no companion, he placed it alone on the sand\r\nbeneath the diamonds, and then, under it, he began to arrange the\r\nsapphires; as he was doing it a shadow passed over him, it was the\r\nshadow of a frigate bird, flying heavily, gorged with its feast and\r\nmaking south; the same wind on which it was drifting brought with it\r\nthe clamouring of the cormorants; he rose, glanced around and with\r\ndazed eyes looked over the sea, sweeping the horizon; there was no sign\r\nof smoke or sail and he sat down again to continue the jewelled pattern\r\non the sand.\r\n\r\nHe counted the sapphires, two dozen and four there were, varying from\r\ncornflower blue to the blue of night, varying in size from the size\r\nof a pea to the size of a broad bean. He arranged them between the\r\nturquoise. The great amethyst he placed beneath the sapphires, and\r\nunder the amethyst the spinels, and peridots, of which there were half\r\na handful. The pear-shaped black pearl, the only pearl amidst all these\r\ntreasures, he placed last.\r\n\r\nThe white pearl, the ring, and the snake were still lying apart by\r\nthemselves; besides the stones arranged in lines there were a few\r\nfragments of gold, bits of settings, which he disregarded.\r\n\r\nThen he sat and contemplated the glittering battalions of his treasure.\r\nWhite, red, blue, the blue of the turquoise, the wine colour of the\r\namethyst, the black of the pearl, he feasted his eyes on them all.\r\nThen, turning on his back, shutting his eyes and casting his right hand\r\nbackwards across them, he laughed.\r\n\r\nHe could see them almost better with his eyes shut. That was the most\r\ndelightful and extraordinary moment in his life, it would have been in\r\nany man’s life; coloured Fortune, real, tangible Fortune, Fortune in\r\nher most beautiful guise at his elbow and the whole blue world before\r\nhim; what he would do with it all he did not dream; great houses of the\r\nwealthy people, snow-white yachts that he had seen in the various parts\r\nof the world, the vision of the saloon of the _Rhone_ laid out with cut\r\nglass and flowers arose before him for a moment; all that belonged to\r\nthe world of the wealthy, all that world was his now, but he built no\r\nimaginary palaces yet, just for the moment the sensation of possession\r\nwas all powerful, he wanted nothing else.\r\n\r\nMarie was fully alive and in the background of his mind, and the\r\nknowledge that his wealth would enable him to reach her was there and\r\nformed part of his satisfaction; but he saw nothing truly yet but the\r\ngreat, blinding light that Fortune was flashing in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAs he lay, the wash of the waves on the desolate beach, the blowing of\r\nthe wind across the bay-cedar bushes, the crying of the frigate birds\r\nand cormorants came to him like sounds heard in a dream.\r\n\r\nThen the crying of the birds led his thoughts back to Yves and Yves\r\nled him back to the stokehold. He could hear the roar of the furnaces\r\nand the boom of the sea, the clatter of the ash lift, the clash of\r\nthe furnace doors. The vision of Fortune had driven all that from his\r\nmind. In the last couple of hours, he had passed through an amazing\r\ndevelopment; all the nobility and pride in his nature had been\r\nquickened into life, latent powers until now unsuspected were awakening\r\nin his being, wealth, and the power of wealth were at his disposal. He\r\nfelt like some exiled king who had at last come to his own, and then,\r\nlo and behold, like some horrible poor relation into his dream stepped\r\nthe stoker of the _Rhone_. Gaspard Cadillac, the Moco, came to spoil\r\nthe dreams of Gaspard Cadillac, the wealthy man. Wealth, that thing for\r\nwhich we all crave, had been in his possession scarcely an hour when it\r\nhit him a blow.\r\n\r\n“Hi, there, you dog of a Moco, hurry your stumps, down to your furnace,\r\n_vite!—vite!—vite!_”\r\n\r\nThose words had been shot at him by Cuillard, the chief engineer of the\r\n_Rhone_ as he had come aboard across the Messagerie wharf at Marseilles\r\nbefore starting. They were nothing to a stoker, but the remembrance of\r\nthem was bitter now, flame-like hatred against Cuillard shot up in his\r\nbreast, till he remembered that Cuillard was silent forever out there\r\nwhere the _Rhone_ was lying by the reef to southward. But that thought\r\ngave him no relief against the past that Cuillard’s words had evoked.\r\nThat wretched past! No present wealth could atone for all those years\r\nof his life and their slavery. Yet only a few hours ago that past had\r\nseemed not amiss!\r\n\r\nTruly the lamp of fortune lights many things besides happiness.\r\n\r\nHe sat up and looked at his hands. They were the hands of a stoker and\r\nnothing on earth would make them anything else. He was not ashamed of\r\nthem, he was not thinking that in the future those hands would proclaim\r\nhim what he was. No, but he was thinking of the black years those hands\r\nhad done slave’s work whilst here was lying the wealth that would have\r\nraised him to a high position in the world. Ah! could he have bought\r\nthose fifteen years back, he would at that moment have given half of\r\nthe glittering stones to Time, utterly forgetting that in that bargain\r\nhe would have lost a white pearl beyond all earthly jewels—Marie.\r\n\r\nThe wind had been falling and now was little more than a steady breeze,\r\nafternoon was upon the island and the sea was falling with the ebbing\r\ntide. He gathered his fortune together into the handkerchief that had\r\ncontained it, then he placed this for extra security into his own\r\nhandkerchief. He knotted the corners tightly and then placed the little\r\nbundle by the stem of the palm tree nearest him; he placed the snake\r\nof gold beside the bundle, the ring on his finger, and the great white\r\npearl in his right-hand pocket.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered Sagesse’s pocket-book. He took it out and opened it.\r\nIt contained only papers all wet with sea water and a note on the Bank\r\nof France for five hundred francs. He placed the note on the sand with\r\na piece of coral on it to prevent the wind from blowing it away. The\r\nsun would dry it. Then he tried to examine the papers, they seemed of\r\nno use or importance to him, some were letters with the ink all blurred\r\nby the sea water, there were insurance certificates, an old theatre\r\nbill of a play performed years ago at a New York theatre, and in one\r\npacket a photograph with, on the back, the photographer’s name.\r\n\r\nNadan, Photographer. Rue Royale, Nimes.\r\n\r\nIt was the photograph of a woman, an old peasant woman to judge by the\r\nface and cap. Could it have been the man’s mother? as likely as not.\r\nAnd he had prized it evidently or he would not have given it a place\r\nin his pocket-book. Why had he kept the theatre bill? Of what romance\r\nor villainy was it the reminiscence, of what woman betrayed or man\r\ndefrauded did he keep it as a memento to be read by Gaspard here, where\r\nto the crying of the cormorants, the past of man seemed a game futile\r\nand filled with derision. A play of shadows—tricking shadows.\r\n\r\nHe put the photograph and the theatre bill back in the pocket-book, and\r\nthe papers; then he made a hole in the sand and buried it. To destroy\r\nthe past of Sagesse utterly was the greatest act that Gaspard could\r\nhave performed for humanity, failing that, to bury the records of it\r\nwas a commendable deed.\r\n\r\nHe had a flint and steel and the tobacco in his own tobacco box had\r\nalmost escaped wetting in the drenching of the night before. He filled\r\nhis pipe and lit it, he had not smoked that day nor the day before\r\nand the tobacco, now, had a doubly soothing action on his mind, it\r\nchased away the stokehold and his recollections of the past, he forgave\r\nSagesse his villainies, it brought the image of Marie from away across\r\nall those miles of ocean, he saw again the early morning market on\r\nthe Place du Fort. Pierre-Alphonse, M. Seguin, and all the gay crowd\r\nbeneath the blue sky and the dark green tamarinds.\r\n\r\nHe would find out Pierre-Alphonse when he returned and buy him a\r\nboat of his own, he would set Marie’s father up again in business at\r\nMorne Rouge, he would give money to all those people whom Sagesse had\r\ndefrauded, he would make St. Pierre happy. That good town where the\r\npeople had been so good to him. Then he would return to Montpellier,\r\nat least for a time, and take Marie with him, they would travel first\r\nclass in the mail boat. He would go down to the stokehold as passengers\r\nsometimes did, ah! the stokers on that ship would have a good time when\r\nthey reached Marseilles. He would go to the Riga tavern and call for\r\na chopin of wine and see Anisette serve it. Ah, Yves, poor Yves, what\r\na pity that he could not take the great, burly Breton by the hand and\r\ngive him a fist full of money—so he lay smoking, playing with coloured\r\nshadows, spending phantom gold, whilst the voices of the cormorants\r\nhalf unheard, came on the wind across the bay-cedar bushes and the\r\nvoices of the waves answered them like eternity making answer to time.\r\n\r\nThen came the thought, “All that is very well, but how are you to turn\r\nyour fortune into gold?”\r\n\r\nThis had not occurred to him before, and at first it seemed a simple\r\nmatter, just a detail, then he remembered Sagesse’s words about\r\ngovernments who were apt to interfere in cases of treasure, men who\r\nsprang from nowhere with fictitious claims. Sagesse was afraid of these\r\nthings and Sagesse was a clever man with thirty years of experience\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nTo go to a jeweller with those things would be to admit at once the\r\nwhole secret; to go to a pawn shop with the smallest of those gems\r\nwould bring on his head enquiries that might prove fatal.\r\n\r\nHere was a question to perplex a stoker’s mind. His strong hands could\r\nfight to protect his treasure, but of what avail was it to protect a\r\nuseless thing?\r\n\r\nHe had read the romance of Monte Christo, few French sailors have not,\r\nthe immortal story that has become part of the history of the world was\r\nrecalled by him here, lost and alone on the desolate islet of whose\r\nexistence the great Dumas had never dreamed.\r\n\r\nBut it gave him little help. He had lived his life in a more sordid\r\nprison than that which held Edmund Dantès for fourteen years. That\r\nblack cell of the Château d’If had been illuminated by the mind of\r\nFaria; the profound intelligence of the Abbé had given the future\r\ncount not only his treasure, but the genius and the worldly knowledge\r\nwhich enabled him to dispose of it and turn it to account. Gaspard\r\nhad no such teaching to guide him. The more he thought of the matter\r\nthe more did his perplexity increase. The world of a sudden seemed to\r\nhim peopled with robbers, antagonists, men who would take from him by\r\nfraud, or law, the thing which was at once his dream and his possession.\r\n\r\nThe curse of the imaginative mind came on him with full force, the\r\nfaculty that had once caused a ghost to haunt him on the islet now\r\nfilled the world with living people and each person an enemy. He\r\npictured men whom he had never seen, not men of his own class, but men\r\ndressed as well-to-do citizens, merchants, and so forth, all sworn\r\nenemies to him and eager for his treasure. He had once been in a law\r\ncourt, called as a witness in a shipping disaster case; he saw that\r\ncourt now, and the three judges, he was standing before them and they\r\nwere questioning him.\r\n\r\n“Well, where did you get these things? Come, now, they are not yours;\r\nyou do not find these things in a stokehold.”\r\n\r\nHe sweated at the thought.\r\n\r\nSagesse had spoken of taking the stuff to America; he knew nothing of\r\nAmerica. Martinique was the only place he could take it to, the only\r\nplace he wanted to reach, and, at once, the remembrance of Martinique\r\nbrought up the image of M. Seguin. Ah! That was the solution. M. Seguin\r\nwould help him. He had all the worldly knowledge necessary.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was satisfied with this way out of the difficulty, and\r\nhe began to doubt—not to doubt, exactly, but to hold up M. Seguin’s\r\nimage before his mind’s eyes and to question it. “You are a reliable\r\nman, I know that, for you are universally respected in St. Pierre; but\r\nthis treasure—look you, it is enormous, and remember, it is all mine;\r\nI don’t want to give anyone half shares; I just want some one to turn\r\nit into money, letting them take a good profit on the transaction,\r\ncertainly, but not letting them rob me; would you do this for me? Could\r\nI trust you?”\r\n\r\nThe mental image of M. Seguin, after the fashion of images, made no\r\nreply. That hatful of gems, those blazing diamonds, furious rubies,\r\nsaint-tempting sapphires, all that coloured temptation, who was there\r\nin the world that might not yield to it? Only one person that he\r\nknew—surely—Marie.\r\n\r\nAh! Could she have peddled them with her other wares, how gladly he\r\nwould have cast them into her lap without count or toll, but she of all\r\npeople in the world was most useless for his purpose.\r\n\r\nHe rose and paced the sands with Fortune, like the Old Man of the Sea,\r\non his back; even in his walk up and down the desolate beach he was\r\ntethered by his treasure, for he dared not go far from that magnetic\r\nbundle lying by the palm bole; it was absurd to feel uneasy, he knew\r\nthat; there was no person here to steal it; all the same, it held him\r\nclose to it.\r\n\r\nNow the sun, which had been steadily sinking, touched the western edge\r\nof the sea and spilled his glory upon the water, the blue and windy day\r\ndied and passed at a stroke to the momentary evening of the tropics,\r\nand the evening into night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a moment, night, wearing all her jewellery, was standing above the\r\nsea, the wind had died away, the cormorants had ceased crying, and the\r\nboom of the waves was the only sound beneath the stillness of the stars.\r\n\r\nGaspard turned to his provision store for supper. He had placed the\r\ncanned meat and the biscuits close to one of the tree boles, and\r\nto-morrow he would have to make a caçhe to protect them from the sun.\r\nThinking of this, he ate his supper without appetite or knowing what\r\nhe ate; his mind had passed into that dazed condition which comes from\r\nsurfeit of sensation; it had fed full of treasure and now was torpid.\r\n\r\nWhen he had supped, he lit a pipe, but scarcely had he done so than\r\nsleep came upon him, the pipe fell from his mouth beside him as he lay\r\nthere on the sands, the stars shining upon him and the sea singing to\r\nhim; marooned, ragged, without a roof to shelter him, and with the\r\nwealth of emperors at his elbow.\r\n\r\nHours passed and the great moving dome of the stars shifted above the\r\nworld; one might have thought the figure on the sand a corpse cast up\r\nby the sea from some wreck. Then it began to move and struggle and cry\r\nout; one might have fancied it attacked by some unseen enemy. It was.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the deep unconsciousness of the first sleep lifted,\r\nadmitting the mind into dreamland, than Gaspard found himself\r\nsurrounded by his enemies. He was passing through horrible back streets\r\nand men were following him to rob him. Yves, Sagesse, and the chief\r\nengineer of the _Rhone_ were amongst them.\r\n\r\nThen the dream changed and he was standing in a bar with Yves, showing\r\nhim the treasure, and, behold, the rubies and diamonds had changed to\r\npieces of glass and the rest to sea shells and rubbish—he had not even\r\nthe price of a drink and he had brought Yves in to stand him a bottle\r\nof wine, brought him in arm in arm, boasting of his wealth!\r\n\r\nThen he was coming on board at the docks of Marseilles, joining\r\nthe ship with the treasure in his pocket, the beautiful spirit of\r\nunreasonableness who presides over the affairs of Dreamland did not\r\nhint to him of the absurdity of the situation, his obfuscated reasoning\r\nfaculty was engaged in trying to solve the problem before him—the\r\nproblem of how to hide a million’s worth of gems and act as stoker on\r\na transatlantic steamer at the same time. To increase the difficulty\r\nhe had placed the snake of gold under the muffler he wore round his\r\nneck—but it refused to be hidden; and then, all at once, he was back\r\nagain in the docks in a tavern, fighting in a corner with his back\r\nto the wall, whilst Malays from the P. & O. boats, Dagoes armed with\r\nsheath knives and a Chinaman—a hatchet man such as he had heard tell\r\nof amidst the stokers—attacked him for his treasure. He awoke gasping\r\nand still fighting his viewless enemies. After a while he fell asleep\r\nagain, only to continue his experiences in Dreamland, awaking finally,\r\njust as the sun’s rim was rising above the sea.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing now from E.S.E., and the sea had lost its waves\r\nand had fallen back into quietude and long lapses of swell—the gulls\r\nwere back.\r\n\r\nNot the cormorants and frigate birds of the northern beach, but the\r\nfishing gulls, the familiar spirits of the island, whose voices had\r\nonce terrified Gaspard. They had returned during the night, but they\r\ndid not terrify him now. Nothing could terrify him now except, perhaps,\r\nthe idea of a robber.\r\n\r\nIt was extraordinary, the effect of this fortune on this imaginative\r\nmind, stiffening and strengthening it against all imaginary fears save\r\nthe fear of material enemies. The man who dreads burglars has no time\r\nto dream of ghosts.\r\n\r\nImmediately on waking he turned and placed his hand upon the treasure,\r\nthen he sat up facing the brave, bright morning; it was all true, then,\r\ndespite his dreams and his visionary enemies he was still in possession\r\nof this incredible and fantastic wealth; his mind, clear now and\r\nstrengthened by sleep, could grasp the matter in its true proportions;\r\nthe stuff was his by all right, he was lineal heir by the right of\r\nlabour and suffering, to the fortune that Sagesse had taken from the\r\nhand of Chance.\r\n\r\nHe could go to M. Seguin with a clear conscience and ask him to help in\r\nthe disposal of these things.\r\n\r\nHe rose up and walked along the beach, every moment casting back an eye\r\nat the place where the treasure was. The storm had brought treasure of\r\nits own to the beach, other than gems, and the falling tide was leaving\r\nbehind it strips of emerald and clear-brown seaweed, starfish, seaweed\r\nwhose roots were clinging still to fragments of red branch coral, great\r\nbunches of flying-fish eggs like bunches of white currants, shells\r\nshewing all the tints of opal and pearl.\r\n\r\nThe great hand of the storm had stripped the sea coves, the tidal\r\nrocks, the gardens of the lagoons, and had cast the coloured harvest on\r\nthe sand; the sea itself had a brighter look, a fresher smell; great\r\ndepths seemed to have been stirred and the freshness and youth that lie\r\nat the heart of ocean to have been diffused through its being.\r\n\r\nO, the vision of the morning sea! The blue distance, the green, curling\r\nwaves, the blowing wind; it is the only thing that never grows old;\r\nunspoiled by time or change, it is to-day as it was when Jason sailed\r\nit, when Helen knew it, when the blue-painted triremes clashed beaks at\r\nSalamis in the morning of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen we first saw Gaspard, a stoker fresh from the _Rhone_, sitting\r\nunder a palm tree smoking and waiting for Yves, he was a man who would\r\nhave been moved not at all by the youth and spirit of this morning sea;\r\nthe crushed aesthetic sense, the imagination that had been subdued\r\nto bar rooms and girls of the type of Anisette, would have responded\r\nscarcely at all to this hilarity of blue waves and morning light—but\r\nit was different now. He had changed and the world had changed; the\r\nchange was perhaps more subtle than profound, altering rather the point\r\nof view than the viewer, yet he had changed. He had learned to expand\r\nhis nostrils to the breeze, to feel pleasure in the morning light, and\r\nsatisfaction in the sense of being.\r\n\r\nAs he stood looking away to southward over the blue sea, he heard the\r\nvoice of the spirit that had mostly wrought the change in him. It was\r\nthe voice of Martinique calling to him, the voice of Marie.\r\n\r\n_Ché._\r\n\r\nIn a moment and for a moment, Fortune, the island, everything, was\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n_Ché._\r\n\r\nThe little word came on the breeze to him. Was she, too, standing on\r\nsome beach or headland gazing over the sea towards him? Was the little\r\nword a butterfly of thought blown to him on the breeze that was\r\nblowing from there?\r\n\r\nWho can say, but he heard it as distinctly as he had heard it that\r\nevening when standing on the road to Morne Rouge and looking down at\r\nSt. Pierre, he had waited for her and she had come to him.\r\n\r\nHe turned away from the sea, then he turned to it again and swept the\r\nhorizon as though looking for a sail. There was nothing to be seen.\r\n\r\nHe walked back along the sea edge in the direction of the palms; the\r\nseven palms had been cast down by the rush of the hurricane, just as\r\nthe stakes of a stock fence might be cast down by the rush of wild\r\ncattle; now, and for the first time, the thought occurred to Gaspard\r\nthat with the palms gone the islet would be less likely to attract the\r\nattention of a passing ship. He looked at them as they lay, and then\r\nhe approached the bundle of treasure and the glittering snake of gold,\r\nwhich were lying by the bole of the westernmost of the fallen trees. He\r\ntouched the bundle with his foot. The action seemed half involuntary;\r\nhe did not seem to be thinking of the bundle or its contents. Nor was\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking of Marie.\r\n\r\nA wild longing, such as the prisoned bird may feel for the blue sky,\r\nfilled him, subordinating everything else to the thought of the being\r\nhe loved.\r\n\r\nEver since _La Belle Arlésienne_ had dropped Martinique behind her this\r\nlonging had been living and growing in his heart; the treasure fever\r\nhad obscured it, the storm had veiled it, the finding of the treasure\r\nhad pushed it aside, but it was there, growing, and patiently waiting.\r\nIt was the master passion of his life, the thing beside which all other\r\nthings were nothing, though for a moment they might veil it, as a\r\ncloud veils a star, or a mist a mountain.\r\n\r\nHe turned away from the treasure and walked towards the bushes, then\r\nhe began to cross the islet, taking the path that Sagesse’s sailors\r\nhad made for the boat. Though he was profoundly engaged in thought, he\r\nnoticed quite little things, as, for instance, that the salt crystals\r\nwere nearly gone from the leaves of the bay-cedar bushes.\r\n\r\nHalf way across, where a view of the northern horizon could\r\nbe obtained, he raised his head and scanned the sea line.\r\nNothing—nothing—Ah! stop! What was that?\r\n\r\nA tiny flake of feldspar seemed clinging to the sky horizon in N.N.W.\r\nIn the wonderful half wheel of crystal blue this microscopic flaw might\r\nhave been passed over by a casual observer. Gaspard folded his arms\r\nand stood gazing at this speck, his lips parted in a half smile, his\r\neyes fixed. Had you been close to him, you would have noticed that he\r\nscarcely breathed.\r\n\r\nThe thing did not seem to alter in shape or increase in size, yet\r\nhe knew that it represented the topsails of a ship hull down on\r\nthe horizon. It was just so that he had first glimpsed _La Belle\r\nArlésienne_ from the open boat.\r\n\r\nThen it increased in size. After keeping him in suspense for what\r\nseemed an age, suddenly his brain was able to say of the vision upon\r\nhis retina, “It is bigger.”\r\n\r\nThen, as he watched it increase, all doubt passed: It was a vessel of\r\nsome sort steering southward. The wind was blowing now steady from\r\nE.S.E.; she would pass the island to westward, perhaps quite close, for\r\nit was all deep water there.\r\n\r\nHis mind, up to the moment of sighting the sail, had been filled with\r\nthe thought of Marie, the craving for her had brought him here to look\r\nout for a sail. Now, after the first joyous leap of the heart, Marie\r\nwas for the moment forgotten. It was as though the sail space on the\r\nsky had been a doorway through which the world had rushed in upon him.\r\n\r\nHe turned and ran back to the southern beach, picked up the treasure\r\nbundle and forced it into his pocket, picked up the jewelled snake and\r\nplaced it round his neck under his shirt.\r\n\r\nThe collar of the flannel shirt scarcely concealed it; it would\r\nnever do to board a vessel with such a gem so lightly concealed, so,\r\nhurriedly, with absurd haste, as though the ship were already abreast\r\nof the island and there was not a moment to lose, he stripped off his\r\ncoat and shirt. For a moment he thought of placing it round his waist,\r\nbut it was not long enough to serve as a belt—then he did what the\r\njeweller who had designed the thing intended its wearer to do—made an\r\narmlet of it.\r\n\r\nIt clung to perfection, and he resumed his shirt and coat. The banknote\r\nthat he had taken from the pocket-book of Sagesse, the white pearl, and\r\nthe gold coin, were all in the left hand coat pocket; he felt them over\r\nwith his left hand whilst his right examined again the bulge made by\r\nthe jewels contained in the right hand pocket.\r\n\r\nIt was not so very noticeable and no one would have dreamed that it was\r\ncaused by treasure. He looked around him on the sand to make sure that\r\nhe had forgotten nothing, and then came back to the vantage point in\r\nthe centre of the islet.\r\n\r\nYes, there she was, palpable to the sight and definite, no longer a\r\nsmudge on the sky-line, but a vessel with all sail set and steering,\r\none would have thought, straight for the islet.\r\n\r\nThen, assured of this, he set to with his sheath knife, cutting dead\r\nbrushwood and heaping it on the pathway; the smoke of a signal fire\r\nwas his only chance of attracting her attention; and having made his\r\npreparations he knelt down by the heap and put his hand in his trousers\r\npocket for his tinder box and steel.\r\n\r\nIt was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nDELIVERANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment he knelt helpless, with idle hands. He knew quite well\r\nthat though the vessel seemed steering straight for the island, she\r\nmight pass it a long distance away; a smoke signal could not but\r\nattract her attention, yet he was debarred from making it.\r\n\r\nThe tricky spirit that seemed to haunt the islet seemed still active\r\nand at work, filling his pockets with jewels, yet holding back from him\r\nthe means of escape.\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet and stared about him, trying to remember when he\r\nhad last lit his pipe; then he came back along the pathway to the\r\nbeach, searching the ground, the sand, casting his eyes hither and\r\nthither, the sweat running from every pore. He searched the whole width\r\nof the beach for twenty yards from the fallen palm trees towards the\r\ncoral spur; the gulls were calling and fishing as of old and their\r\nvoices seemed mocking him, he, who, burning for action, had yet to walk\r\nup and down slowly as an old man, with head bent and eyes cast before\r\nhim after the fashion of a penitent.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of the box; it was a small affair, one of those\r\ncheap nickel tinder boxes they sell to sailors, a “smoker’s friend”\r\ncontaining a wheel armed with a bit of flint, a spring which rotated\r\nthe wheel, and a tiny wick which caught the spark.\r\n\r\nHe was turning from the beach in despair when his foot struck against\r\nwhat seemed a pebble half covered by sand. It was the “smoker’s\r\nfriend.” It had fallen last night from his pocket and the wind had\r\nblown the sand over it. He seized it and with it in his hand came\r\nrunning back to the heap of brushwood. He first turned his eyes to the\r\nship. She was larger, nearer, yet seemingly farther from the track of\r\nthe island; as far as he could judge she might pass it by some three\r\nmiles. He flung himself on his knees by the heap of brushwood and\r\npressing the spring of the tinder box, struck a spark. It caught on\r\nthe inflammable wick, the wick smouldered, and then, as he blew at it,\r\nbroke into flame. It was a very small flame, not nearly as big as that\r\ngiven by a large sized wax match. Then he approached the tiny point of\r\nlight to one of the dead twigs of the brushwood. He was kneeling with\r\nhis back to the wind so as to protect the flame, but for all his care a\r\nbreath across his shoulder blew it out.\r\n\r\nHe cursed. Then holding the box close to his body, he re-lit the wick.\r\n\r\nThe wetting the box had received during the hurricane must have damaged\r\nits spirit; yesterday when he had lit his pipe with it he had done\r\nso with great difficulty, but the flame was even more feeble to-day;\r\nit went out again at the critical moment, and again, and again; the\r\nbrushwood, perhaps, from the effect of the sea-salt that had dried upon\r\nit, was hard to ignite; had he but a piece of paper the task would have\r\nbeen easy, but there was not a scrap on the island.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered Sagesse’s pocket-book, which he had buried in the\r\nsand. He was rising to hunt for it when he remembered also the banknote\r\nthat he had taken from the papers of Sagesse and which was in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nTo find the pocket-book might take a long time, for the sand had blown\r\nsmoothly over the place where he had buried it; the banknote was to his\r\nhand and would burn bravely. It did.\r\n\r\nAs it took light, and as its flame took the brushwood, a burst of\r\ndiscordant cries came from the fishing ground of the gulls away to the\r\nsoutheast. They were fighting over some fish, no doubt, or some offal\r\nof the sea cast shoreward, yet as the blue smoke curled upwards and as\r\nthe last of the five hundred franc note burnt Gaspard’s fingers, one\r\nmight have fancied that they were shouting in derision:\r\n\r\n“There goes the first of your fortune in smoke—smoke—smoke. Hi,\r\nyou there amidst the bushes, think you to escape us with Serpente’s\r\ntreasure? It is ours—Hi! do you hear? It is ours—ours—ours—Our\r\nvoices will follow you wherever it goes, bringing weariness,\r\ndesolation—death—Hi! Hi! Hi!”\r\n\r\nAbsurdity, of course, yet the voices of the gulls were a part of the\r\nfatefulness of that place, with the blinding light and the desolation,\r\nthey made its personality—after all, was it absurdity or poetry on the\r\npart of the castaway to read into all that a menace, to feel Serpente’s\r\nfist still closed upon his treasure, to hear the voices of his sailors\r\nin the voices of the gulls. No man can say who has not heard the spirit\r\nof the sea speak on the quays of Florida, by the lagoons of the coast,\r\non the islands of the Caribbean—who has not seen Laropé’s topsails\r\nbreak the horizon, leading into poor reality the hull of some trading\r\nship, or heard the gulls of the lagoons telling the fate of the old\r\nbuccaneers.\r\n\r\nNow the bonfire was burning bravely, and Gaspard, attacking the bay\r\ncedars with his knife, cast younger wood upon the flames; it damped\r\nthem down, but it gave smoke, blankets and spirals of blue-grey smoke,\r\nthickening, deepening, and at last rising in a steady column. He ran to\r\nthe fallen palm trees and hacked away their fronds, half dried and half\r\nwithered by the sea; they increased the flame and more green brushwood\r\nincreased the smoke.\r\n\r\nIt was now magnificent, a pillar of darkness rising in the air, bending\r\nto the wind and breaking into fronds of smoke.\r\n\r\nHe left it, and shading his eyes stared out across the sea. The vessel\r\nwas almost abreast of the island, about three miles away to northward,\r\nscarcely two miles to westward; she was a small vessel, ship rigged;\r\nthat is to say, with square sails on all her three masts; she would not\r\nbe more than two hundred and fifty or three hundred tons.\r\n\r\nThe wind had veered almost into the east, so she had it on her beam.\r\n\r\nShe seemed indifferent to all things and as divorced from reality as a\r\npainted ship in some brilliant picture of the sea. Never did it seem\r\npossible that she would respond to call or signal.\r\n\r\nShe was abreast of the island now—and now—Gaspard could scarcely\r\nbelieve his eyes—she was altering her course; the wind was spilling\r\nfrom her sails—she was heaving to.\r\n\r\nHe saw a boat detach itself from her, a tiny speck at first, now\r\nlarger, now plainly visible; it was making, not for the western side,\r\nbut for the southern beach, where the landing was good. Evidently the\r\nvessel knew the island and had landed a boat here before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nSIMON STOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nHe made for the beach and stood there waiting. The rocks to westward\r\ncut off his view of the oncoming boat and he had time for a moment’s\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nHe felt like an actor who had to appear on the stage with a\r\nhalf-learned part. Thinking entirely of how to hide his treasure, he\r\nhad forgotten to invent a story to account for his presence on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIt was too late now, for here came the boat’s nose round the western\r\nrocks, a large, white-painted boat, flashing eight oars in the sun.\r\n\r\nNow she was coming dead on for the beach and Gaspard was wading out\r\nknee-deep to meet her. Within ten strokes of the beach, the men ceased\r\nrowing and she came bravely on, the bow oar standing up and shouting\r\nsomething in English which Gaspard did not understand; he waved and\r\nshouted a reply in French and the next moment he was clutching the\r\nthwart, being hauled aboard and shoved aft.\r\n\r\nThe mate of the vessel, who was steering, a hatchet-faced American,\r\nhauled Gaspard down beside him and without waiting for word or\r\nquestion, which would have been useless, considering that he could\r\nscarcely speak a syllable of French, shouted orders to the crew and the\r\nboat poled off from the shore and began its return journey to the ship.\r\n\r\n“French?” said the mate, when they were under way.\r\n\r\nGaspard nodded, “_Oui_, _oui_,” then pointing behind him, “wreck;” it\r\nwas one of the few English words that he knew. The hands in the boat,\r\nall Americans, lean-faced, bronze, chewing as they rowed, looked with\r\ninterest at the marooned one and made remarks about him one to the\r\nother, but the mate, after the first interrogation, seemed to have\r\nno interest in anything but getting back to the ship as quickly as\r\npossible. There was a life belt in the stern of the boat with the words\r\n“Anne Martin” on it.\r\n\r\nGaspard pointed to the name and then at the ship they were approaching.\r\n\r\n“Anne Martine?” asked he.\r\n\r\nThe mate nodded and spat into the sea.\r\n\r\n“_Quelle porte?_” asked Gaspard, pointing southward.\r\n\r\n“St. Pierre.”\r\n\r\n“_St. Pierre!_” cried Gaspard. “_O mon Dieu, St. Pierre—St. Pierre\r\nMartinique?_”\r\n\r\nThe mate nodded.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Gaspard could not believe that such luck was his. Out of\r\nthirty or forty possible ports she was bound for St. Pierre, for Marie.\r\nThen he laughed and clapped his knees with his hands; the oarsmen\r\nlaughed half mockingly, poking fun at him in American slang, but the\r\nmate did not laugh, he was a man who, to use his own expression, had no\r\nuse for laughter, besides, his eyes and his mind were otherwise engaged.\r\n\r\nGaspard, in his excitement over lighting the signal fire and the\r\napproach of the boat, had forgotten one thing. He was wearing the\r\ndiamond ring he had taken from Sagesse, a terrible blunder, almost\r\nunbelievable, did not one know the capacity of the human mind for error.\r\n\r\nThe mate, he was first officer of the _Anne Martin_ and his name was\r\nSkinner—though he could scarcely keep his eyes from the flashing\r\njewel, said nothing, and now the boat was under the port quarter of the\r\n_Anne Martin_, oars were in and Gaspard climbing the ladder which had\r\nbeen flung down, whilst a hard-faced man in a panama, Captain Stock,\r\nno less, the master of the vessel, was leaning over the side shouting\r\ndirections to the mate.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the crew were on board, the boat swung up at the davits,\r\nthe braces manned and the _Anne Martin_ on her course again.\r\n\r\nThen, and not till then, did Captain Stock turn to the new-comer.\r\n\r\n“He’s French,” said Skinner, “wrecked over there, but he’s got a\r\ndiamond on his finger worth ten thousand dollars that wants explaining.”\r\n\r\nThe Captain glanced at Gaspard, fixed his eyes on the ring and then\r\nsaid, “Call Diego, he can chatter to him, it’s all the d——d Dago is\r\ngood for.”\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Gaspard, seeing Captain Stock’s gaze fixed\r\non his hand, recognised that he was wearing the ring.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Diego, a fat Portugee, with black curls and earrings, came\r\nrunning aft. Then, through the mediumship of this interpreter, Captain\r\nStock began to question the marooned one.\r\n\r\n“How long have you been wrecked?”\r\n\r\n“Some days.”\r\n\r\n“Storm or what?”\r\n\r\n“Storm.”\r\n\r\n“Where did you get that ring you are wearing?”\r\n\r\n“Found it.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“On the island.”\r\n\r\n“Picked it up?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“On the beach.”\r\n\r\nHere Gaspard broke across the questions with a statement.\r\n\r\n“Tell M. le Capitaine the ring is mine. I found it, and I shall sell\r\nit at St. Pierre and pay him handsomely for my passage. I have friends\r\nat St. Pierre who can speak for me. I want to go on this ship as a\r\npassenger; not to work my passage.”\r\n\r\n“Who can you name at St. Pierre as a friend?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Seguin—Paul Seguin.”\r\n\r\nThe name appeared to have an effect upon Captain Stock.\r\n\r\n“What was the name of your ship?”\r\n\r\n“_La Belle Arlésienne._”\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the words left Gaspard’s mouth than an extraordinary\r\nchange took place in the face of the Captain; long enough by nature, it\r\nlengthened still more. He came forward and grasped Gaspard’s arm.\r\n\r\n“_La Belle Arlésienne!!!_”\r\n\r\n“_Oui._”\r\n\r\n“Belonging to Pierre Sagesse?”\r\n\r\n“Pierre Sagesse—_oui_.”\r\n\r\n“Was he on board—Hi, you d——d Dago, ask him was Pierre Sagesse\r\naboard.”\r\n\r\nDiego put the question.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Was he lost?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“He’s dead—sure?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—_O ma foi_, yes. I left him with the crabs eating him.”\r\n\r\nStock had been one of Pierre Sagesse’s many victims. Stock was not\r\nowner of the _Anne Martin_, only master, but he had once owned a ship\r\nin the West India trade, had become involved in Sagesse’s net and\r\nruined. The hatred of hell would scarcely express in words the hatred\r\nof Simon Stock for Pierre Sagesse. No wonder, then, that he did what\r\nhe did on the news of Pierre Sagesse’s death and the statement about\r\nthe crabs, and what he did was this. Flung up his chin till his scrawny\r\nand vulturous neck was sunlit from hyoid bone to sternum, clicked his\r\nfingers like castanets, laughed horribly, called the hands aft, ordered\r\nSkinner to serve them out a tot of rum all round and, then, taking\r\nGaspard by the arm, led him down the companion-way to the dismal place\r\nthat went by the name of the saloon.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door of a dog hole that had served once for a third\r\nofficer’s cabin and Diego, who had followed, translating, he said:\r\n\r\n“You can berth here and for nothing, the news that Peer Sagesse is in\r\nhell is all the payment I want. Make yourself at home, sonny, call for\r\nwhat you want, drinks _or_ smokes and dinner’s at eight bells.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned on his heel and went on deck, followed by Diego, leaving\r\nGaspard to settle into his new quarters. A palace would not have\r\npleased him better at the moment, than this dingy place. He had dreaded\r\nbeing berthed in the fo’cs’le, to have carried a fortune of many\r\nthousands of pounds in gems into such a place, to live in that mixed\r\ncommunity for several weeks and to keep the fortune hidden would have\r\nbeen a difficult task indeed.\r\n\r\nHere it was perfectly simple, there was an upper and a lower bunk, each\r\nwith a mattress, there was no steward, so Diego had told him, so there\r\nwould be no one fussing about making beds. He took the bundle from his\r\npocket and placed it in a corner of the upper bunk under the mattress,\r\nas he did so he felt the absolute physical pleasure that comes when the\r\nbody is relieved of a heavy load. He could move now freely and having\r\nclosed the door of the cabin, he came on deck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nMOUNT PELÉE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good fortune that had followed him pursued also the _Anne Martin_,\r\nthe wind held steady, the sky clear; flying, fresh weather and a\r\nsparkling sea brought her into the Caribbean; they sighted ships but\r\nalways at a distance, sails that flecked the far off horizon and\r\nvanished, long wreaths of steamer smoke, phantoms speaking as vaguely\r\nof the world of men as the strips of fucus floating past on the swell.\r\n\r\nNot only had they good weather but good temper reigned on board.\r\n\r\nStock, a “hard case” in the language of sailors, had taken in, with the\r\nnews of Sagesse’s death, a cargo of good humour that promised to last\r\nhim till they fetched Martinique.\r\n\r\nGaspard had his meals in the cabin, with the few words of English that\r\nhe knew and a few more that he picked up daily, he could make his wants\r\nunderstood without the assistance of Diego; as for conversation, he\r\ndid just as well with his half dozen words as with a thousand, for\r\nconversation there was none amidst the after guard of the _Anne Martin_.\r\n\r\nAs day followed day and Martinique crept closer to them, so did the\r\nidea of Marie grow in Gaspard’s mind, ousting the idea of Fortune\r\nand all other ideas and preoccupations. Just as, on the approach to\r\nSkeleton Island, the vision of treasure drove her image from his mind,\r\nnow on his approach to Martinique, so did her image cast out the vision\r\nof treasure. If he thought of his wealth at all, it was only connection\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nOne night, under a sky blazing with stars, he was standing on deck\r\nwatching the phosporescent gleams in the water. Captain Stock, who had\r\njust emerged from the cabin companion-way came towards him, leaned over\r\nthe bulwark, took his cigar from his mouth and expectorated into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” said the Captain, pointing right ahead.\r\n\r\nGaspard started.\r\n\r\n“Martinique?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThen the Captain went forward, leaving Gaspard alone.\r\n\r\nHe knew they were close to the island, but he had not reckoned that\r\nthey were so near as that.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow, he would see Marie to-morrow. To-morrow, he would be walking\r\nthe pleasant sunlit streets of St. Pierre, he remembered the shops of\r\nthe Rue Victor Hugo. O, what would he not buy her! He would take her\r\nand say, “All St. Pierre is yours—take what you please.”\r\n\r\nThen he cast his thoughts abroad, all through St. Pierre, wandering\r\nhither and thither, and touching this person, and that, with a loving\r\nhand. Man’m Faly, Pierre-Alphonse, the girls who were Marie’s friends.\r\nFinotte, Honorine, Lys, they would all share in his jubilee, and there\r\nwas something grim in the idea that the pleasantest thing he was\r\nbringing with him, the thing that would make him most welcome in the\r\ncoloured city, was the news of Pierre Sagesse’s death.\r\n\r\nHe went below and turned in, and fell asleep with his mind full of\r\nthese pleasant imaginings.\r\n\r\nThis was the season of the most heavy rains and he had been asleep\r\nscarcely an hour when the _Anne Martin_ sailed into a rain squall, and\r\nthe thunder of rain on the deck reached him in dreamland.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of his dreams at once took the form of the little Place de\r\nla Fontaine, where he had first met Marie. He was walking there with\r\nher and the sun was shining brightly, the sky was blue. Then, all at\r\nonce, he lost her. She had vanished amidst the crowd of dream people\r\nwho were strolling through the Place.\r\n\r\nThen, just as on the day he first met her “clash—ripple—clash” came\r\nthe _carillon_ of the cathedral bells, but they did not bring him to\r\nMarie, clouds darkened the sky and the thunder of rain filled the air,\r\nand through it all the bells ringing on joyous, triumphant, golden,\r\nlike the voice of the love that lives beyond disaster and death—Then\r\nhe awoke.\r\n\r\nIt was pitch dark and the thunder of the rain on deck was ceasing.\r\n\r\nHe lay awake for an hour and then he slept again, only to repeat the\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nA little after dawn he awoke with the bells sounding so loudly in\r\nhis ears that he could have sworn they were anchored in the bay and\r\nthat the cathedral was greeting them with a peal, but he knew by the\r\nmovement of the ship that this was not so.\r\n\r\nHe put his hand into the upper bunk, and taking the treasure bundle\r\nfrom beneath the mattress, put it in his pocket. Then he came on deck.\r\n\r\nThe sun had already shewed himself just above the horizon, but the sky\r\nwas clouded to southward and rain squalls dimmed the horizon.\r\n\r\nS. S. E. and perhaps not more than ten miles away lay Martinique with\r\nPelée wrapped in ragged and dirty-coloured clouds. He looked like a\r\nking whose robes had gone to tatters till the sun rising more fully,\r\ntouched him with gold, and white, and pearl against the deepening blue\r\nof the sky.\r\n\r\nGaspard gazed awhile at this majestic sight. They had not opened the\r\nBay of St. Pierre yet, but the _Anne Martin_ was already altering her\r\ncourse and in half an hour or less they would have the bay and city\r\nfull in view.\r\n\r\nDominica to eastward lay unclouded, haze-blue upon the morning sea,\r\nbeautiful as a dream.\r\n\r\nGaspard, turning from the weather bulwarks on which he had been\r\nleaning, began to cut some tobacco in the palm of his hand and to fill\r\nhis pipe. Whilst he was engaged in this business, he heard a hurried\r\nfootstep and Skinner came running aft.\r\n\r\nThe mate darted down the companion-way to the cabin and almost\r\nimmediately reappeared with a telescope; after him came Captain Stock,\r\na pair of marine glasses in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe two men went forward to the bow. Gaspard followed them. He judged\r\nfrom their manner that something of interest had hove in sight and he\r\nwas not wrong; leaning against the weather bulwarks a little forward\r\nof the foremast, Skinner clapped the glass to his eye and pointed it\r\nat Martinique. Stock raised his binoculars. At that moment, there was\r\nnothing to be seen, for the clouds on Pelée had fanned out and the bay\r\nof St. Pierre was veiled by sheets of sun-dazzled rain, then, against\r\nthe vanishing clouds, slowly appeared the stem of a broken arch,\r\nthe foot of a rainbow. It passed with the clouds and the sun struck\r\nMartinique.\r\n\r\nThe sun was high now and it struck the western coast over the\r\nshoulders of Pelée and the mountains; not a cloud lingered upon the\r\nisland, except a cloud, a cone of smoke rising from Pelée, yet to\r\nGaspard as he strained his eyes, it seemed that a thick grey cloud\r\nclung to Pelée from apex to base, clung to St. Pierre, veiling the\r\ncoloured houses utterly from sight, and to the whole arc of the bay,\r\nhiding the trees, the triumphant palms, the angelines, the tamarinds.\r\n\r\n“My God!” said Skinner. The hand that held the glass was shaking,\r\nhis face had become bloodless under its bronze. Captain Stock, the\r\nbinoculars still glued to his eyes, was talking rapidly to himself in\r\nan undertone. Gaspard, who could not see as they saw, who could not\r\nunderstand as they understood, could, yet, comprehend dimly the terror\r\nbefore him, sunlit, and facing the gem-like sea.\r\n\r\nSt. Pierre had vanished utterly, Pelée was no longer the verdant\r\nmountain towering triumphantly above the flower-like city; a cone of\r\ndismal ashes smoking to the sky, above a land of dismal ashes, that was\r\nall there was left of that lovely world. And it was all so still, so\r\npeaceful with the peace that hangs over ruins of great antiquity!\r\n\r\nYet, but a few weeks ago, Pelée was youthful with foliage, the\r\n_canotiers_ were paddling in the sapphire bay, the city was waving\r\nits flags to the sun, mirroring its coloured houses in the water. The\r\nchildren were singing their songs and telling their Tim-Tim in the\r\nstreets. The market-place was gay with life, the gardens gay with\r\ncolour, the streets with laughter and over all hung the poetry of\r\neternal summer. And now all that was with Thebes, with Nineveh—a world\r\nof ashes, desolation, silence.\r\n\r\nStock, the Yankee skipper, a man whom few things could move, lowered\r\nthe glasses, pressed his left hand tight over his eyes as if they had\r\nbeen hurt by some painful light and then, leaning over the bulwarks,\r\nbecame violently sick.\r\n\r\nGaspard, who had seized the glasses from his hand, looked. As he looked\r\nhe swayed from side to side as though the vision before him had grasped\r\nhim by the shoulders and he was wrestling with it.\r\n\r\nSkinner caught him as the glasses fell from his hand. He had fainted\r\nand Diego, with the assistance of another sailor carried him below and\r\nput him in his bunk.\r\n\r\nCaptain Stock and the mate followed, they loosed his collar and left\r\nhim lying whilst they sat down at the saloon table and Diego fetched\r\nthem rum.\r\n\r\nIt was British Navy rum, thirty above proof and it gave them the\r\nstiffening they required.\r\n\r\n“It’s that cursed mountain,” said Stock at last. “She’s blown her side\r\nout—must have occurred just after we left Boston or we’d have had news\r\nof it by cable from some of the other islands, sure.”\r\n\r\nThey rose to go on deck, but before doing so they looked in to see how\r\nGaspard was doing.\r\n\r\nHe had recovered consciousness, but he lay like a man dazed after some\r\nterrible accident. His eyes were fixed as if on some form seen only by\r\nhimself and on his cheek there were tears.\r\n\r\nThey spoke to him and he heard, but he made no reply, only a movement\r\nof the hand as though to say, “Let me be.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nASHES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they came on deck, the vessel, still on her course had drawn\r\nnearer to the land, several men-of-war and relief ships were at anchor\r\nin the bay.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the _Anne Martin_ were held spellbound by the disaster,\r\njust as their officers had been. Nor did use to the scene break the\r\nspell, for the nearer they approached the more appalling did the\r\npicture of destruction appear.\r\n\r\nHad you not known of the catastrophe, had you not known that this place\r\na few weeks ago was the most beautiful corner of the world, you would\r\nhave said, “this is surely the great cinder dumping ground of the\r\nuniverse. Here from the beginning of time men have cast their ashes\r\nand cities their detritus, if I were to poke a stick amidst all that I\r\nwould surely find amphorae from Sparta and broken gourds from Nineveh\r\nalong with the empty tomato tins and the broken crockery-ware of the\r\nmodern world. What a horror. How dare Time expose this rubbish heap\r\nto insult the gaze of the Creator, this monstrosity of desolation to\r\ninsult the eye of man.”\r\n\r\nAnd even then you would not have felt the heart of this great\r\ndesolation, you would not have heard the voices of the gardens, the\r\ncomplaint of the _fleur d’amour_, the weeping of the gouyave water,\r\nthe voices of the vanished streets. You would not have known that\r\nbeneath that miserable rubbish of nature, that dust, grey as the brick\r\ndust of the old grey temple of Ruin, lay children grasping their\r\ntoys, girls once more beautiful than the flowers in the gardens, men,\r\nyoung, and brave, but a few weeks ago, and filled with the joy of life,\r\nPierre-Alphonse, the kindly fisherman and Man’m Faly the good-hearted\r\nfriend of sailors.\r\n\r\nEven still, amidst the ruin one might see some trace of the\r\nconfiguration of the city, just as in a face ruined by some terrible\r\ndisease one may recognize the ghosts of features.\r\n\r\nA gun followed by a signal from one of the war vessels, made the\r\n_Anne Martin_ heave to. The bay was full of wrecks and dangerous to\r\nnavigation. In-shore lay the cable ship _Grappler_, sunk with all\r\nhands, further out all the shipping that had been in the bay on that\r\nfateful morning lay fathoms deep withered by the burning scoriae—all\r\nsave the _Roddam_, that gallant ship saved by the energy and heroism of\r\nher commander.\r\n\r\nWarned by a boat from the warship, Captain Stock put the _Anne Martin_\r\nabout and made for Fort de France down the coast, there to wait for\r\norders from the owners.\r\n\r\nWhen the vessel was on her new course, he went down to see how Gaspard\r\nwas doing. He was lying just as he had been left, still staring\r\nstraight before him, not vacantly, but as if at some definite vision.\r\n\r\nWhen he had looked through the marine glasses, when he had swept the\r\nscene of destruction from smoking Pelée to the sea, the whole tragedy\r\nwas made plain to him, even to its cause. The place he loved, all that\r\nhe loved, everything that meant life to him had vanished.\r\n\r\nHis was the greatest tragedy in which a man has ever been condemned\r\nto act. He had sailed, leaving the lovely city and the woman he loved\r\ngazing at him until dimmed by the veil of distance, he had returned,\r\nraised the veil, and found—this.\r\n\r\nThe immensity of it almost made it a thing impersonal without in the\r\nleast destroying the anguish of it. As he lay there in his bunk he saw\r\nMarie and he saw himself, he saw the city. He saw the Rue Victor Hugo\r\nand the blue sky, the Place du Fort, and the waving tamarinds; he heard\r\nthe voices of the people and the _carillon_ of the cathedral bells, and\r\nall that seemed the scenery of a beautiful play, acted under a summer\r\nsky in a land of impossible happiness—gone now as though it had never\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nMarie had never been, surely she had never been, never had he met her\r\nin the Place de la Fontaine. Those coloured streets, those gay people,\r\nthat town of pictures, those flowers, and trees, all that was an\r\nillusion so it seemed to his mind, whilst his heart, broken, yet still\r\nbeating, told him indistinctly that all this had been, living, warm,\r\nand real. Real as Marie now dead and lost to him forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nTHE FOOTSTEP IN THE DUST\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Pierre had passed away and with St. Pierre, Marie, and with Marie\r\nhis will to live.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary and most tragically poetic part of his drama was the\r\nmanner in which St. Pierre, the lost city, clung to the vision of the\r\nwoman he loved.\r\n\r\nShe wore it as a garment; he saw her surrounded by its beauty; dawn lit\r\nher in the Street of the Precipice, morn in the music-haunted Place de\r\nla Fontaine; evening in the twilit Jardin des Plantes.\r\n\r\nThe super-mortal tragedy of the city had raised her image to supernal\r\nheights. The passion, the agony that lives alone in the highest poetry\r\nhad mixed itself in this common man’s tragedy. The city obliterated\r\nfrom the world was part of his grief.\r\n\r\nAs he lay like a man fascinated by a serpent, motionless, scarcely\r\nseeming to breathe, with eyes fixed, and pupils dilated, the roar of\r\nthe anchor-chain through the hawse pipe shook the vessel. He sat up,\r\nleaning on his elbow, exactly as a man sits up who has been awakened\r\nsuddenly from sleep.\r\n\r\nA disc of reflected sunlight, liquid and tremulous as the water from\r\nwhich it was reflected, was cast by the porthole upon the wall of the\r\ncabin; it trembled and moved to the motion of the vessel as she rocked\r\nat her moorings.\r\n\r\nHe gazed at it, following it with his eyes as it leapt and quivered;\r\nthen, slipping from the bunk he stood erect on the floor of the cabin.\r\n\r\nHe was fully dressed and, in the act of stepping from the bunk, his\r\nfull strength seemed to have returned to him. He opened the door of the\r\ncabin and a moment later he was on deck.\r\n\r\nAll the crew were gathered forward; a boat was rowing away from the\r\nship, Captain Stock and the mate were in it, and they were making for\r\nthe nearest war-ship. The _Anne Martin_ was close in shore and the\r\nvast, formless, blanketed city cast its chill gray reflection on the\r\nwater of the harbour. Mounds of ashes terraced by the heavy rains,\r\nwildernesses of ashes mounting to wildernesses of ashes, ghosts of\r\nbuildings vaguely outlined beneath their cerement of ashes—cinders,\r\ndust, and ashes, and from all that immensity of desolation not a\r\nsound, save now and then a call from one of the working parties, half\r\ninvisible amidst the ruins.\r\n\r\nHe cast his eyes over it all and then up to Pelée still fuming in the\r\nwindless blue; like a madman, exhausted, the great mountain seemed\r\ninexpressibly sinister above the ruins of the city it had protected\r\nfor long years, fed with the gouyave water, sheltered from the winds.\r\nGaspard stretched out his arms, his fingers were crooked, it was as\r\nthough the man were saying to the mountain, “Ah, what would I not do\r\nwith you, if I only had you in my grip!”\r\n\r\nThen he clambered over the starboard rail.\r\n\r\nThe men forward did not hear the splash, nor did they notice the black\r\nhead of the swimmer passing towards the shore.\r\n\r\nHe had not even kicked off the deck shoes he was wearing, he swam with\r\nease and half unconsciously; in his condition all things were possible\r\nto him, he would have guided his way through a turbulent sea just as\r\nsurely as across this summer-smooth harbour. And now he was clinging\r\nto the angle of a great block of stone shaken out from the once\r\nquay-wall and slobbered round by the tide. He dragged himself on to it,\r\nand from it to the next.\r\n\r\nThe Place Bertine had been here; here in the sunlight the tamarinds\r\nhad shaken their leaves to the wind and cast dancing shadows on the\r\nsun-smitten pavement, the songs of the _canotiers_ had mixed with the\r\nsounds of trade—here where tamarind trees would bloom no more; where\r\nthe blasting scoriae had fused broken stones and broken building; where\r\nthe sunlight was horrible.\r\n\r\nAround him lay nothing but mounds where once the sugar barrels had\r\nbeen piled, where buildings had been. Mounds like the sand dunes on a\r\ndesolate coast. A little wind had arisen and, just as amidst the dunes\r\nthe wind brings the whisper of sand, here, it brought the faint silky\r\nwhisper of dust.\r\n\r\nHe had no objective—no object, here, but to feel the ruin; to touch\r\nit, walk amidst it, become part of it. To torture his soul. All this\r\nwas her bed, the dust he trod on her winding sheet, the desolation her\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nHe passed amidst the mounds. In the great mountain of ashes before him\r\nthe rains had washed out what seemed the bed of a mountain torrent.\r\nIt had once been a street. He began to climb it. This horrible ravine\r\nwas tainted by a faint sickly smell of corruption, the crust of the\r\nscoriae broke beneath his feet so that he plunged sometimes knee-deep,\r\nthe sweat ran from his brow, and the sun struck fiercely on him. The\r\nheat was terrific. Never, even in the old days of the stokehold, had he\r\nexperienced such heat, yet still he climbed.\r\n\r\nHe had reached, now, a transverse ravine, a huge donga with steep banks\r\nfrom which here and there broke out the walls of ruined houses. It was\r\nthe Rue Victor Hugo.\r\n\r\nThe silence here was terrible, the silence of Nineveh, the silence of\r\nthe Nothing, which is at the heart of things. Finotte and Lys; the\r\ncorrossole sellers; the merchants and traffickers; the coloured crowd;\r\nthe little children—nothing spoke of them here.\r\n\r\nAnd, still, far above him went the mountain of ashes, the broken\r\nstreets, walls that had once been houses, charred stumps that had once\r\nbeen palm trees. And still he climbed. He had cast off his coat, never\r\nthinking of the treasure in its pocket, he had forgotten all that, even\r\nMarie had become vague as a ghost in his mind. One thing only stood\r\nclearly before him, half-mesmerised as he was by exhaustion, heat, and\r\nthe ruin around him—the beach of Grande Anse. The soot-black beach and\r\nthe green curling waves where a man might find oblivion. He did not\r\nknow in the least that it was the vision of Marie that was calling him\r\nto the cliffs, where he had first truly met her face to face.\r\n\r\nAt noon, broken, dazed, grimed with dust, having a dozen times escaped\r\nby a miracle from death, he reached the summit of the ruins of St.\r\nPierre, and the path of ashes that had once been the road to Morne\r\nRouge. Gazing from here, and not glancing at the ruined city, nothing\r\nhad altered. The sea lay the same as of old, and Dominica shewed\r\nghostly and haze-blue on the far sea line, gulls were flying over\r\nthe bay. Eternal summer sat by the ruined city, voiceless, and lost\r\nin eternal sleep. Though the silence of the Rue Victor Hugo had been\r\nbroken by no sound, up here, could be heard a faint breathing from the\r\nsea. The requiem of the ocean whose tide was now flooding into the bay.\r\n\r\n“Ah, the palms, the coloured houses, the old sea-steps I used to\r\nwash—the voices of the _canotiers_, the tall ships I brought thee,\r\nwhere are they?” Vaguely, like a voice heard in a dream came the\r\nwhispered lament of the sea.\r\n\r\nGaspard did not hear it. He paused only to rest and breathe, he had\r\nslipped and fallen many times in his ascent; coatless, his arms were\r\nclay-coloured with sweat-caked volcanic dust; his face was frightful;\r\ngrimed and seamed—it looked as though spat upon by Ruin. In a few\r\nshort hours his eyes had become sunken, his cheeks had fallen in; his\r\nlips baked and parched, and caked with dust were inhuman, the lips of a\r\ntragic mask of antiquity. A frightful thirst filled him, obliterating\r\nall other feelings. Beneath him lay the city, formless and bulked out\r\nwith cinders and dust, exactly as the ship of coral had once lain\r\nbeneath him bulked out with coral in the still lagoon.\r\n\r\nAh, that night when he had turned with Yves from the vision of the\r\nsunken ship, feeling that what he had seen was evil; could he but have\r\nseen this greater vision! This greater story of man’s futility and the\r\nfate of the imaginers of vain things!\r\n\r\nHe turned, seeing nothing of it all but the great white sheet of light\r\nthat leapt from the horizon half-way to the zenith, and the dazzle of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nHe came along the path of cinders that had once been a road set\r\nwith grenadillas and palms; merry with mule bells and songs of the\r\ncane-cutters by day, drifted over by fireflies at night. The volcanic\r\ndust, the sun, the terrible climb amidst the ruins had called up the\r\nthirst which is known only in the desert. He walked scarcely knowing\r\nwhere he went, casting his eyes from side to side of the way in search\r\nof water. He had forgotten the black beach at Grande Anse and his\r\ndesire for the oblivion of the sea; he had only one immediate desire,\r\nto drink.\r\n\r\nThirst in its acutest form like this is quite divorced from the\r\nsensation which civilisation knows as thirst. It is a passion far\r\nstronger than hatred or desire, it affects the soul no less than the\r\nbody, it drives all other feelings before it and reigns supreme. The\r\nphysical pangs are nothing compared to the mental desire which drives\r\nall other desires away.\r\n\r\nAs he turned the shoulder of Pelée, the ashes ceased on the road giving\r\nplace to volcanic dust, for only St. Pierre and the western portion of\r\nthe island had been exposed to the full blast of the eruption. The road\r\nbecame a road again, and, had he possessed eyes to see, hope might have\r\ncome to him.\r\n\r\nFor here, where Marie used to pause of a morning to drink in the view\r\nbefore her, still lay the view as of old. The volcanic dust that had\r\nlain grey on tree and shrub, had been washed away by rains, and the\r\ngreen waving canes, the palms, and wild pines, the tamarinds, and\r\nceibas, the mornes, mountains, and valleys lay stretched before him;\r\nwho saw nothing of it all, walking like a somnambulist in the dream of\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\nHe had passed Morne Rouge where there was no sign of life, and the\r\nMorne d’Avril was showing green, but unseen, before him when the voice\r\nof water, liquid, and laughing, broke the silence. It was a way-side\r\nfountain. Crystal water spouting from a moss-grown lion-head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was like drinking life; the mountains in the distance became\r\nmountains again; the wind, the wind; and the sunlight, the sunlight;\r\nthe world of shadows and semi-delirium through which he had been\r\nwalking, faded away. Like a good enchantress, the water had washed away\r\nthe stains of his journey and the thirst from his soul. In that moment,\r\njust like one convalescing from a severe illness, he felt newborn. He\r\nwas seated upon a bank, and above him in the trade wind waved the huge\r\nfronds of ferns, and before him lay a field of canes overripe, that\r\nhad been spared the cane-cutters’ knives.\r\n\r\nHalf drowsy, still exhausted, but wrapped in the new feeling of\r\nwell-being, like a man who is recovering from an anaesthetic, he noted\r\nhis surroundings; and, as his eyes travelled from point to point, they\r\nsuddenly came to rest on a spot just before him.\r\n\r\nOn the dust of the road, sheltered by the bank and the ferns from\r\nthe wind, lay the imprint of a naked foot. A woman’s little foot had\r\npressed the dust of the road but a short time before; the print was\r\nwarm to the sight and living, one could almost see the fleeting figure\r\nswiftly moving as the breeze, and graceful as the bending palm. The\r\nprint of the heel was far less marked than that of the fore part.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic dust, though gone from the foliage, still lay upon the\r\nroad, and on this dust of ruin lay the woman’s foot mark, vivid,\r\ntriumphant over death. Gaspard gazed at it. He glanced at the fountain\r\nbeside him singing and laughing beneath the shadow of the ferns, then\r\nhe remembered. It was here that he had paused that day with Marie; it\r\nwas here that she had given him the ratifia, it was here—it was here.\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet, gazed again at the mark in the road and followed\r\nits printing. Farther on he lost it, for the wind had blown the dust\r\nacross it; further on he found it, very faint, but still discernible.\r\n\r\nThen, where a little side path broke off from the road, he found it\r\nclearly again.\r\n\r\nShe had taken the path.\r\n\r\nAlong the National Road you find many paths like these. Short cuts to\r\nvillages, paths used by the cane cutters and market folk, often mere\r\ntraces half smothered by the tropical grasses.\r\n\r\nHe followed the path which led towards a wood of ceibas and angelines,\r\npalms with enormous trunks, thick as the trunks of full grown oak\r\ntrees; tree ferns and wild pines.\r\n\r\nAs he came a voice hailed him from the liquid shadow of the trees, it\r\nwas the voice of the _siffleur de montagne_; clear, silvery, bell-like,\r\nthe voice of the bird came through the silence of the sultry noon.\r\nThere was no other sound but the stirring of the palm fronds in the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nHere, amidst the trees, by this old forgotten pathway lay a shrine to\r\nthe Virgin; one of the thousand shrines that are found on the roads and\r\npathways of Martinique. As he pushed the lianas and the air shoots of\r\nthe wild pine aside, a voice other than the voice of the _siffleur de\r\nmontagne_ met his ear. The bird had ceased, and through the murmur of\r\nthe wind in the trees came this voice; the voice of a woman, sweeter\r\nthan the voice of the bird.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMoving silently as a shadow, pushing the leafy veils aside, scarcely\r\nbreathing, he reached a point from which he could see vaguely in the\r\ntwilight of the trees the shrine and the woman kneeling before it.\r\n\r\nHer voice was clear now, and the soft, childish Creole words of the\r\nvotary came to him for whom she was giving thanks.\r\n\r\nNo supplicatory prayer was this, but an assured thanksgiving for the\r\nsafety of one who had been spared the darkness and the terror of chaos,\r\nthe horror of death, the fate of her ruined world, for one who was safe\r\nand who would return. “At morning, noon, and evening, I have praised\r\nthee on my knees—”\r\n\r\nIt was the noonday prayer—and it passed devoutly from a prayer of\r\npraise to one of supplication. Supplication for the souls of the dead\r\nand for the living, for Missie Seguin who had been spared even as she\r\nhad been spared; for herself, a creature not deserving the protection\r\nthat had saved her, that had led her away to the safety of Grande Anse\r\nwhen Pelée had spoken and the world had fallen in ruins.\r\n\r\nThen she rose to her feet, the white magic of Love and Faith still like\r\na light upon her face. As her eyes fell upon the man standing beneath\r\nthe trees, for one divine second she paused with breath caught back,\r\nspirit like, and ringed with the twilight as with a charm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhere the trade wind was blowing and the green waves breaking on the\r\nbeach of Grande Anse, welcome and a new life were waiting for them.\r\n\r\nThe man he had saved from the _fer de lance_ had the will and the power\r\nto open the doors of a golden future for them, yet they could not break\r\nfrom yesterday so soon.\r\n\r\nHeedless of time or place they sat by the road-side fountain, till\r\nthe shadows were lengthening on the road and the valleys humming with\r\nnight. Darkness found them on the ruined road above the ruined city.\r\n\r\nThey had come almost unconsciously to look at it again, to breathe the\r\nair of the past through which they had so miraculously wandered, and,\r\nas they stood clasping one another, gazing through the vagueness at the\r\nlights of the warships in the bay, the sea of a sudden became touched\r\nwith silver and the rising moon broke above the shoulder of Pelée.\r\n\r\nThe light flooded across the harbour and struck the shrouded city like\r\na tide. The ruins of the Place Bertine came into view; its broken and\r\nveiled cathedral, the thread of darkness outlining the Rue Victor Hugo.\r\n\r\nIn the moonlight the desolation became robbed of its terror and all was\r\ntouched with the poetry of deep antiquity, from the flooding sea to the\r\nforms of the lovers set far above the ruins.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nPage 1: The letters after the second “Ç” in the sub-title “JEAN\r\nFRANÇOIS—JEAN FRANÇOIS” were missing; Transcriber added what is shown\r\nin this ebook.\r\n\r\nPage 294: “it was only connection with her” seems to be missing the word\r\n“in”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Ship of Coral, by H. de Vere Stacpoole",
