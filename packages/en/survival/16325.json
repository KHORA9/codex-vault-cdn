'Tis my\r\nnative country: for I am not of those who 'praise the busy town.' On\r\nthe contrary, in the words of the great poet who has just departed to\r\njoin Milton and Shelley in a place of high collateral glory, I 'love to\r\nrail against it still,' with a naturalist's bitterness. For the town is\r\nalways dead and lifeless. There are who admire it, they say--poor\r\npurblind creatures--because, forsooth, 'there is so much life there.'\r\nSo much life, indeed! No grass in the streets; no flowers in the lanes;\r\nno beetles or butterflies on the dull stone pavements! Brick and mortar\r\nhave killed out all life over square miles of Middlesex. For myself, I\r\nlove better the densely-peopled fields than this human desert, this\r\nbeflagged and macadamised man-made solitude. The country teems with\r\nlife on every hand; a thousand different plants and flowers in the\r\nspangled meadows; a thousand varied denizens of pond, and air, and\r\nheath, and copses. Their ways are endless. They attract me far more\r\nwith their infinite diversity than the grey and gloomy haunts of the\r\ncab-horse and the stock-broker.\r\n\r\nBut my Arcady, as you will see, is none the less tolerably broad and\r\neclectic in its limits. These various essays have been suggested to my\r\npen by rambles far and wide between its elastic confines. The little\r\ntractate on _Mud_, for example, recalls to mind some pleasant weeks\r\namong the Italian lakes and on the plain of Lombardy. _A Desert Fruit_\r\nowes its origin to a morning at Luxor. _High Life_ had its key-note\r\nstruck by a fortnight in the Tyrol. _Tropical Education_ is a dim\r\nreminiscence of old Jamaican experiences. Our _Eight-Legged Friends_\r\nwere observed at leisure on the window-panes of our own little nook at\r\nDorking. _A Hill-Top Stronghold_ was sketched _in situ_ at Florence by\r\na window that looked across the valley to Fiesole. Excursions into\r\nbooks or into the remoter past have given occasion for the\r\narchæological essays relegated here to the end of the volume.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to Messrs. Longmans for permission to reprint from\r\ntheir magazine _My Islands_, _A Hill-Top Stronghold_, _A Desert Fruit_,\r\n_The Isle of Ruim_, _Eight-Legged Friends_, and _Tropical Education_. I\r\nhave also to acknowledge a similar courtesy on the part of Messrs.\r\nSmith & Elder with regard to _Mud_, _The Bronze Axe_, _High Life_,\r\n_Pretty Poll_, _The Greenwood Tree_, _On the Wings of the Wind_,\r\n_Casters and Chesters_, and _Fish as Fathers_, all of which originally\r\nappeared in the _Cornhill_. Messrs. Chatto & Windus have been equally\r\nkind as regards the paper on _An English Shire_ contributed to the\r\n_Gentleman's_. _A Persistent Nationality_ made its first bow in the\r\n_North American Review_, and has still to be introduced to an English\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nG.A.\r\n\r\nHind Head, Surrey, _Oct._, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SCIENCE IN ARCADY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MY ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the Miocene period, as well as I can now remember\r\n(for I made no note of the precise date at the moment), my islands\r\nfirst appeared above the stormy sheet of the North-West Atlantic as a\r\nlittle rising group of mountain tops, capping a broad boss of submarine\r\nvolcanoes. My attention was originally called to the new archipelago by\r\na brother investigator of my own aerial race, who pointed out to me on\r\nthe wing that at a spot some 900 miles to the west of the Portuguese\r\ncoast, just opposite the place where your mushroom city of Lisbon now\r\nstands, the water of the ocean, as seen in a bird's-eye view from some\r\nthree thousand feet above, formed a distinct greenish patch such as\r\nalways betokens shoals or rising ground at the bottom. Flying out at\r\nonce to the point he indicated, and poising myself above it on my broad\r\npinions at a giddy altitude, I saw at a glance that my friend was quite\r\nright. Land making was in progress. A volcanic upheaval was taking\r\nplace on the bed of the sea. A new island group was being forced right\r\nup by lateral pressure or internal energies from a depth of at least\r\ntwo thousand fathoms.\r\n\r\nI had always had a great liking for the study of material plants and\r\nanimals, and I was so much interested in the occurrence of this novel\r\nphenomenon--the growth and development of an oceanic island before my\r\nvery eyes--that I determined to devote the next few thousand centuries\r\nor so of my æonian existence to watching the course of its gradual\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nIf I trusted to unaided memory, however, for my dates and facts, I\r\nmight perhaps at this distance of time be uncertain whether the moment\r\nwas really what I have roughly given, within a geological age or two,\r\nthe period of the Mid-Miocene. But existing remains on one of the\r\nislands constituting my group (now called in your new-fangled\r\nterminology Santa Maria) help me to fix with comparative certainty the\r\nprecise epoch of their original upheaval. For these remains, still in\r\nevidence on the spot, consist of a few small marine deposits of Upper\r\nMiocene age; and I recollect distinctly that after the main group had\r\nbeen for some time raised above the surface of the ocean, and after\r\nsand and streams had formed a small sedimentary deposit containing\r\nUpper Miocene fossils beneath the shoal water surrounding the main\r\ngroup, a slight change of level occurred, during which this minor\r\nisland was pushed up with the Miocene deposits on its shoulders, as a\r\nsort of natural memorandum to assist my random scientific\r\nrecollections. With that solitary exception, however, the entire group\r\nremains essentially volcanic in its composition, exactly as it was when\r\nI first saw its youthful craters and its red-hot ash-cones pushed\r\ngradually up, century after century, from the deep blue waters of the\r\nMid-Miocene ocean.\r\n\r\nAll round my islands the Atlantic then, as now, had a depth, as I said\r\nbefore, of two thousand fathoms; indeed, in some parts between the\r\ngroup and Portugal the plummet of your human navigators finds no\r\nbottom, I have often heard them say, till it reaches 2,500; and out of\r\nthis profound sea-bed the volcanic energies pushed up my islands as a\r\nsmall submarine mountain range, whose topmost summits alone stood out\r\nbit by bit above the level of the surrounding sea. One of them, the\r\nmost abrupt and cone-like, by name now Pico, rises to this day, a\r\nmagnificent sight, sheer seven thousand feet into the sky from the\r\nplacid sheet that girds it round on every side. You creatures of\r\nto-day, approaching it in one of your clumsy new-fashioned fire-driven\r\ncanoes that you call steamers, must admire immensely its conical peak,\r\nas it stands out silhouetted against the glowing horizon in the deep\r\nred glare of a sub-tropical Atlantic sunset.\r\n\r\nBut when I, from my solitary aerial perch, saw my islands rise bare and\r\nmassive first from the water's edge, the earliest idea that occurred to\r\nme as an investigator of nature was simply this: how will they ever get\r\nclad with soil and herbage and living creatures? So naked and barren\r\nwere their black crags and rocks of volcanic slag, that I could hardly\r\nconceive how they could ever come to resemble the other smiling oceanic\r\nislands which I looked down upon in my flight from day to day over so\r\nmany wide and scattered oceans. I set myself to watch, accordingly,\r\nwhence they would derive the first seeds of life, and what changes\r\nwould take place under dint of time upon their desolate surface.\r\n\r\nFor a long epoch, while the mountains were still rising in their active\r\nvolcanic state, I saw but little evidence of a marked sort of the\r\ngrowth of living creatures upon their loose piles of pumice. Gradually,\r\nhowever, I observed that spores of lichens, blown towards them by the\r\nwind, were beginning to sprout upon the more settled rocks, and to\r\ndiscolour the surface in places with grey and yellow patches. Bit by\r\nbit, as rain fell upon the new-born hills, it brought down from their\r\nweathered summits sand and mud, which the torrents ground small and\r\ndeposited in little hollows in the valleys; and at last something like\r\nearth was found at certain spots, on which seeds, if there had been\r\nany, might doubtless have rooted and flourished exceedingly.\r\n\r\nMy primitive idea, as I watched my islands in this their almost\r\nlifeless condition, was that the Gulf Stream and the trade winds from\r\nAmerica would bring the earliest higher plants and animals to our\r\nshores. But in this I soon found I was quite mistaken. The distance to\r\nbe traversed was so great, and the current so slow, that the few seeds\r\nor germs of American species cast up upon the shore from time to time\r\nwere mostly far too old and water-logged to show signs of life in such\r\nungenial conditions. It was from the nearer coasts of Europe, on the\r\ncontrary, that our earliest colonists seemed to come. Though the\r\nprevalent winds set from the west, more violent storms reached us\r\noccasionally from the eastward direction; and these, blowing from\r\nEurope, which lay so much closer to our group, were far more likely to\r\nbring with them by waves or wind some waifs and strays of the European\r\nfauna and flora.\r\n\r\nI well remember the first of these great storms that produced any\r\ndistinct impression on my islands. The plants that followed in its wake\r\nwere a few small ferns, whose light spores were more readily carried on\r\nthe breeze than any regular seeds of flowering plants. For a month or\r\ntwo nothing very marked occurred in the way of change, but slowly the\r\nspores rooted, and soon produced a small crop of ferns, which, finding\r\nthe ground unoccupied, spread when once fairly started with\r\nextraordinary rapidity, till they covered all the suitable positions\r\nthroughout the islands.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, however, additions to the flora, and still more to\r\nthe fauna, were very gradually made; so much so that most of the\r\nspecies now found in the group did not arrive there till after the end\r\nof the Glacial epoch, and belong essentially to the modern European\r\nassemblage of plants and animals. This was partly because the islands\r\nthemselves were surrounded by pack-ice during that chilly period, which\r\ninterrupted for a time the course of my experiment. It was interesting,\r\ntoo, after the ice cleared away, to note what kinds could manage by\r\nstray accidents to cross the ocean with a fair chance of sprouting or\r\nhatching out on the new soil, and which were totally unable by original\r\nconstitution to survive the ordeal of immersion in the sea. For\r\ninstance, I looked anxiously at first for the arrival of some casual\r\nacorn or some floating filbert, which might stock my islands with\r\nwaving greenery of oaks and hazel bushes. But I gradually discovered,\r\nin the course of a few centuries, that these heavy nuts never floated\r\nsecurely so far as the outskirts of my little archipelago; and that\r\nconsequently no chestnuts, apple trees, beeches, alders, larches, or\r\npines ever came to diversify my island valleys. The seeds that did\r\nreally reach us from time to time belonged rather to one or other of\r\nfour special classes. Either they were very small and light, like the\r\nspores of ferns, fungi, and club-mosses; or they were winged and\r\nfeathery, like dandelion and thistle-down; or they were the stones of\r\nfruits that are eaten by birds, like rose-hips and hawthorn; or they\r\nwere chaffy grains, enclosed in papery scales, like grasses and sedges,\r\nof a kind well adapted to be readily borne on the surface of the water.\r\nIn all these ways new plants did really get wafted by slow degrees to\r\nthe islands; and if they were of kinds adapted to the climate they grew\r\nand flourished, living down the first growth of ferns and flowerless\r\nherbs in the rich valleys.\r\n\r\nThe time which it took to people my archipelago with these various\r\nplants was, of course, when judged by your human standards, immensely\r\nlong, as often the group received only a single new addition in the\r\nlapse of two or three centuries. But I noticed one very curious result\r\nof this haphazard and lengthy mode of stocking the country: some of the\r\nplants which arrived the earliest, having the coast all clear to\r\nthemselves, free from the fierce competition to which they had always\r\nbeen exposed on the mainland of Europe, began to sport a great deal in\r\nvarious directions, and being acted upon here by new conditions, soon\r\nassumed under stress of natural selection totally distinct specific\r\nforms. (You see, I have quite mastered your best modern scientific\r\nvocabulary.) For instance, there were at first no insects of any sort\r\non the islands; and so those plants which in Europe depended for their\r\nfertilisation upon bees or butterflies had here either to adapt\r\nthemselves somehow to the wind as a carrier of their pollen or else to\r\ndie out for want of crossing. Again, the number of enemies being\r\nreduced to a minimum, these early plants tended to lose various\r\ndefences or protections they had acquired on the mainland against slugs\r\nor ants, and so to become different in a corresponding degree from\r\ntheir European ancestors. The consequence was that by the time you men\r\nfirst discovered the archipelago no fewer than forty kinds of plants\r\nhad so far diverged from the parent forms in Europe or elsewhere that\r\nyour savants considered them at once as distinct species, and set them\r\ndown at first as indigenous creations. It amused me immensely.\r\n\r\nFor out of these forty plants thirty-four were to my certain knowledge\r\nof European origin. I had seen their seeds brought over by the wind or\r\nwaves, and I had watched them gradually altering under stress of the\r\nnew conditions into fresh varieties, which in process of time became\r\ndistinct species. Two of the oldest were flowers of the dandelion and\r\ndaisy group, provided with feathery seeds which enable them to fly far\r\nbefore the carrying breeze; and these two underwent such profound\r\nmodifications in their insular home that the systematic botanists who\r\nat last examined them insisted upon putting each into a new genus, all\r\nby itself, invented for the special purpose of their reception. One\r\nalmost equally ancient inhabitant, a sort of harebell, also became in\r\nprocess of time extremely unlike any other harebell I had ever seen in\r\nany part of my airy wanderings. But the remaining thirty new species or\r\nso evolved in the islands by the special circumstances of the group had\r\nvaried so comparatively little from their primitive European ancestors,\r\nthat they hardly deserved to be called anything more than very distinct\r\nand divergent varieties.\r\n\r\nSome five or six plants, however, I noted arrive in my archipelago, not\r\nfrom Europe, but from the Canaries or Madeira, whose distant blue peaks\r\nlay dim on the horizon far to the south-west of us, as I poised in\r\nmid-air high above the topmost pinnacle of my wild craggy Pico. These\r\nkinds, belonging to a much warmer region, soon, as I noticed, underwent\r\nconsiderable modification in our cooler climate, and were all of them\r\nadjudged distinct species by the learned gentlemen who finally reported\r\nupon my island realm to British science.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can recollect, then, the total number of flowering plants I\r\nnoted in the islands before the arrival of man was about 200; and of\r\nthese, as I said before, only forty had so far altered in type as to be\r\nconsidered at present peculiar to the archipelago. The remainder were\r\neither comparatively recent arrivals or else had found the conditions\r\nof their new home so like those of the old one from which they\r\nmigrated, that comparatively little change took place in their forms or\r\nhabits. Of course, just in proportion as the islands got stocked I\r\nnoticed that the changes were less and less marked; for each new plant,\r\ninsect, or bird that established itself successfully tended to make the\r\nbalance of nature more similar to the one that obtained in the mainland\r\nopposite, and so decreased the chances of novelty of variation.\r\n\r\nHence, it struck me that the oldest arrivals were the ones which\r\naltered most in adaptation to the circumstances, while the newest,\r\nfinding themselves in comparatively familiar surroundings, had less\r\noccasion to be selected for strange and curious freaks or sports of\r\nform or colour.\r\n\r\nThe peopling of the islands with birds and animals, however, was to me\r\neven a more interesting and engrossing study in natural evolution than\r\nits peopling by plants, shrubs, and trees. I may as well begin,\r\ntherefore, by telling you at once that no furry or hairy quadruped of\r\nany sort--no mammal, as I understand your men of science call them--was\r\never stranded alive upon the shores of my islands. For twenty or thirty\r\ncenturies indeed, I waited patiently, examining every piece of\r\ndriftwood cast up upon our beaches, in the faint hope that perhaps some\r\ntiny mouse or shrew or water-vole might lurk half drowned in some\r\ncranny or crevice of the bark or trunk. But it was all in vain. I ought\r\nto have known beforehand that terrestrial animals of the higher types\r\nnever by any chance reach an oceanic island in any part of this planet.\r\nThe only three specimens of mammals I ever saw tossed up on the beach\r\nwere two drowned mice and an unhappy squirrel, all as dead as\r\ndoornails, and horribly mauled by the sea and the breakers. Nor did we\r\never get a snake, a lizard, a frog, or a fresh-water fish, whose eggs I\r\nat first fondly supposed might occasionally be transported to us on\r\nbits of floating trees or matted turf, torn by floods from those\r\nprehistoric Lusitanian or African forests. No such luck was ours. Not a\r\nsingle terrestrial vertebrate of any sort appeared upon our shores\r\nbefore the advent of man with his domestic animals, who played havoc at\r\nonce with my interesting experiment.\r\n\r\nIt was quite otherwise with the unobtrusive small deer of life--the\r\nsnails, and beetles, and flies, and earthworms--and especially with the\r\nwinged things: birds, bats, and butterflies. In the very earliest days\r\nof my islands' existence, indeed, a few stray feathered fowls of the\r\nair were driven ashore here by violent storms, at a time when\r\nvegetation had not yet begun to clothe the naked pumice and volcanic\r\nrock; but these, of course, perished for want of food, as did also a\r\nfew later arrivals, who came under stress of weather at the period when\r\nonly ferns, lichens, and mosses had as yet obtained a foothold on the\r\nyoung archipelago. Sea-birds, of course, soon found out our rocks; but\r\nas they live off fish only, they contributed little more than rich beds\r\nof guano to the permanent colonising of the islands. As well as I can\r\nremember, the land-snails were the earliest truly terrestrial casuals\r\nthat managed to pick up a stray livelihood in these first colonial days\r\nof the archipelago. They came oftenest in the egg, sometimes clinging\r\nto water-logged leaves cast up by storms, sometimes hidden in the bark\r\nof floating driftwood, and sometimes swimming free on the open ocean.\r\nIn one case, as I recall to myself well, a swallow, driven off from the\r\nPortuguese coast, a little before the Glacial period had begun to\r\nwhiten the distant mountains of central and northern Europe, fell\r\nexhausted at last upon the shore of Terceira. There were no insects\r\nthen for the poor bird to feed upon, so it died of starvation and\r\nweariness before the day was out; but a little earth that clung in a\r\npellet to one of its feet contained the egg of a land-shell, while the\r\nprickly seed of a common Spanish plant was entangled among the winged\r\nfeathers by its hooked awns. The egg hatched out, and became the parent\r\nof a large brood of minute snails, which, outliving the cold spell of\r\nthe Ice Age, had developed into a very distinct type in the long period\r\nthat intervened before the advent of man in the islands; while the seed\r\nsprang up on the natural manure heap afforded by the swallow's decaying\r\nbody, and clinging to the valleys during the Glacial Age on the\r\nhill-tops, gave birth in due season to one of the most markedly\r\nindigenous of our Terceira plants.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, too, very minute land-snails would arrive alive on the\r\nisland after their long sea-voyage on bits of broken forest-trees--a\r\ncircumstance which I would perhaps hesitate to mention in mere human\r\nsociety were it not that I have been credibly informed your own great\r\nnaturalist, Darwin, tried the experiment himself with one of the\r\nbiggest European land-molluscs, the great edible Roman snail, and found\r\nthat it still lived on in vigorous style after immersion in sea-water\r\nfor twenty days. Now, I myself observed that several of these bits of\r\nbroken trees, torn down by floods in heavy storm time from the banks of\r\nSpanish or Portuguese rivers, reached my island in eight or ten days\r\nafter leaving the mainland, and sometimes contained eggs of small\r\nland-snails. But as very long periods often passed without a single new\r\nspecies being introduced into the group, any kind that once managed to\r\nestablish itself on any of the islands usually remained for ages\r\nundisturbed by new arrivals, and so had plenty of opportunity to adapt\r\nitself perfectly by natural selection to the new conditions. The\r\nconsequence was, that out of some seventy land-snails now known in the\r\nislands, thirty-two had assumed distinct specific features before the\r\nadvent of man, while thirty-seven (many of which, I think, I never\r\nnoticed till the introduction of cultivated plants) are common to my\r\ngroup with Europe or with the other Atlantic islands. Most of these, I\r\nbelieve, came in with man and his disconcerting agriculture.\r\n\r\nAs to the pond and river snails, so far as I could observe, they mostly\r\nreached us later, being conveyed in the egg on the feet of stray waders\r\nor water-birds, which gradually peopled the island after the Glacial\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nBirds and all other flying creatures are now very abundant in all the\r\nislands; but I could tell you some curious and interesting facts, too,\r\nas to the mode of their arrival and the vicissitudes of their\r\nsettlement. For example, during the age of the Forest Beds in Europe, a\r\nstray bullfinch was driven out to sea by a violent storm, and perched\r\nat last on a bush at Fayal. I wondered at first whether he would effect\r\na settlement. But at that time no seeds or fruits fit for bullfinches\r\nto eat existed on the islands. Still, as it turned out, this particular\r\nbullfinch happened to have in his crop several undigested seeds of\r\nEuropean plants exactly suited to the bullfinch taste; so when he died\r\non the spot, these seeds, germinating abundantly, gave rise to a whole\r\nvalleyful of appropriate plants for bullfinches to feed upon. Now,\r\nhowever, there was no bullfinch to eat them. For a long time, indeed,\r\nno other bullfinches arrived at my archipelago. Once, to be sure, a few\r\nhundred years later, a single cock bird did reach the island alone,\r\nmuch exhausted with his journey, and managed to pick up a living for\r\nhimself off the seeds introduced by his unhappy predecessor. But as he\r\nhad no mate, he died at last, as your lawyers would say, without issue.\r\n\r\nIt was a couple of hundred years or so more before I saw a third\r\nbullfinch--which didn't surprise me, for bullfinches are very woodland\r\nbirds, and non-migratory into the bargain--so that they didn't often\r\nget blown seaward over the broad Atlantic. At the end of that time,\r\nhowever, I observed one morning a pair of finches, after a heavy storm,\r\ndrying their poor battered wings upon a shrub in one of the islands.\r\nFrom this solitary pair a new race sprang up, which developed after a\r\ntime, as I imagined they must, into a distinct species. These local\r\nbullfinches now form the only birds peculiar to the islands; and the\r\nreason is one well divined by one of your own great naturalists (to\r\nwhom I mean before I end to make the _amende honorable_). In almost all\r\nother cases the birds kept getting reinforced from time to time by\r\nothers of their kind blown out to sea accidentally--for only such\r\nspecies were likely to arrive there--and this kept up the purity of the\r\noriginal race, by ensuring a cross every now and again with the\r\nEuropean community. But the bullfinches, being the merest casuals,\r\nnever again to my knowledge were reinforced from the mainland, and so\r\nthey have produced at last a special island type, exactly adapted to\r\nthe peculiarities of their new habitat.\r\n\r\nYou see, there was hardly ever a big storm on land that didn't bring at\r\nleast one or two new birds of some sort or other to the islands.\r\nNaturally, too, the newcomers landed always on the first shore they\r\ncould sight; and so at the present day the greatest number of species\r\nis found on the two easternmost islands nearest the mainland, which\r\nhave forty kinds of land-birds, while the central islands have but\r\nthirty-six, and the western only twenty-nine. It would have been quite\r\ndifferent, of course, if the birds came mainly from America with the\r\ntrade winds and the Gulf Stream, as I at first anticipated. In that\r\ncase, there would have been most kinds in the westernmost islands, and\r\nfewest stragglers in the far eastern. But your own naturalists have\r\nrightly seen that the existing distribution necessarily implies the\r\nopposite explanation.\r\n\r\nBirds, I early noticed, are always great carriers of fruit-seeds,\r\nbecause they eat the berries, but don't digest the hard little stones\r\nwithin. It was in that way, I fancy, that the Portugal laurel first\r\ncame to my islands, because it has an edible fruit with a very hard\r\nseed; and the same reason must account for the presence of the myrtle,\r\nwith its small blue berry; the laurustinus with its currant-like fruit;\r\nthe elder-tree, the canary laurel, the local sweet-gale, and the\r\npeculiar juniper. Before these shrubs were introduced thus\r\nunconsciously by our feathered guests, there were no fruits on which\r\nberry-eating birds could live; but now they are the only native trees\r\nor large bushes on the islands--I mean the only ones not directly\r\nplanted by you mischief-making men, who have entirely spoilt my nice\r\nlittle experiment.\r\n\r\nIt was much the same with the history of some among the birds\r\nthemselves. Not a few birds of prey, for example, were driven to my\r\nlittle archipelago by stress of weather in its very early days; but\r\nthey all perished for want of sufficient small quarry to make a living\r\nout of. As soon, however, as the islands had got well stocked with\r\nrobins, black-caps, wrens, and wagtails, of European types--as soon as\r\nthe chaffinches had established themselves on the seaward plains, and\r\nthe canary had learnt to nest without fear among the Portugal\r\nlaurels--then buzzards, long-eared owls, and common barn-owls, driven\r\nwestward by tempests, began to pick up a decent living on all the\r\nislands, and have ever since been permanent residents, to the immense\r\nterror and discomfort of our smaller song-birds. Thus the older the\r\narchipelago got the less chance was there of local variation taking\r\nplace to any large degree, because the balance of life each day grew\r\nmore closely to resemble that which each species had left behind it in\r\nits native European or African mainland.\r\n\r\nI said a little while ago we had no mammal in the islands. In that I\r\nwas not quite strictly correct. I ought to have said, no terrestrial\r\nmammal. A little Spanish bat got blown to us once by a rough\r\nnor'easter, and took up its abode at once among the caves of our\r\narchipelago, where it hawks to this day after our flies and beetles.\r\nThis seemed to me to show very conspicuously the advantage which winged\r\nanimals have in the matter of cosmopolitan dispersion; for while it was\r\nquite impossible for rats, mice, or squirrels to cross the intervening\r\nbelt of three hundred leagues of sea, their little winged relation, the\r\nflitter-mouse, made the journey across quite safely on his own leathery\r\nvans, and with no greater difficulty than a swallow or a wood-pigeon.\r\n\r\nThe insects of my archipelago tell very much the same story as the\r\nbirds and the plants. Here, too, winged species have stood at a great\r\nadvantage. To be sure, the earliest butterflies and bees that arrived\r\nin the fern-clad period were starved for want of honey; but as soon as\r\nthe valleys began to be thickly tangled with composites, harebells, and\r\nsweet-scented myrtle bushes, these nectar-eating insects established\r\nthemselves successfully, and kept their breed true by occasional\r\ncrosses with fresh arrivals blown to sea afterwards. The development of\r\nthe beetles I watched with far greater interest, as they assumed fresh\r\nforms much more rapidly under their new conditions of restricted food\r\nand limited enemies. Many kinds I observed which came originally from\r\nEurope, sometimes in the larval state, sometimes in the egg, and\r\nsometimes flying as full-grown insects before the blast of the angry\r\ntempest. Several of these changed their features rapidly after their\r\narrival in the islands, producing at first divergent varieties, and\r\nfinally, by dint of selection, acting in various ways, through climate,\r\nfood, or enemies, on these nascent forms, evolving into stable and\r\nwell-adapted species. But I noticed three cases where bits of driftwood\r\nthrown up from South America on the western coasts contained the eggs\r\nor larvae of American beetles, while several others were driven ashore\r\nfrom the Canaries or Madeira; and in one instance even a small insect,\r\nbelonging to a type now confined to Madagascar, found its way safely by\r\nsea to this remote spot, where, being a female with eggs, it succeeded\r\nin establishing a flourishing colony. I believe, however, that at the\r\ntime of its arrival it still existed on the African continent, but\r\nbecoming extinct there under stress of competition with higher forms,\r\nit now survives only in these two widely separated insular areas.\r\n\r\nIt was an endless amusement to me during those long centuries, while I\r\ndevoted myself entirely to the task of watching my fauna and flora\r\ndevelop itself, to look out from day to day for any chance arrival by\r\nwind or waves, and to follow the course of its subsequent vicissitudes\r\nand evolution. In a great many cases, especially at first, the\r\nnew-comer found no niche ready for it in the established order of\r\nthings on the islands, and was fain at last, after a hard struggle, to\r\nretire for ever from the unequal contest. But often enough, too, he\r\nmade a gallant fight for it, and, adapting himself rapidly to his new\r\nenvironment, changed his form and habits with surprising facility. For\r\nnatural selection, I found, is a hard schoolmaster. If you happen to\r\nfit your place in the world, you live and thrive, but if you don't\r\nhappen to fit it, to the wall with you without quarter. Thus sometimes\r\nI would see a small canary beetle quickly take to new food and new\r\nmodes of life on my islands under my very eyes, so that in a century or\r\nso I judged him myself worthy of the distinction of a separate species;\r\nwhile in another case, I remember, a south European weevil evolved\r\nbefore long into something so wholly different from his former self\r\nthat a systematic entomologist would have been forced to enrol him in a\r\ndistinct genus. I often wish now that I had kept a regular collection\r\nof all the intermediate forms, to present as an illustrative series to\r\none of your human museums; but in those days, of course, we none of us\r\nimagined anybody but ourselves would ever take an interest in these\r\nproblems of the development of life, and we let the chance slide till\r\nit was too late to recover it.\r\n\r\nNaturally, during all these ages changes of other sorts were going on\r\nin my islands--elevations and subsidences, separations and reunions,\r\nwhich helped to modify the life of the group considerably. Indeed,\r\nvolcanic action was constantly at work altering the shapes and sizes of\r\nthe different rocky mountain-tops, and bringing now one, now another,\r\ninto closer relations than before with its neighbours. Why, as recently\r\nas 1811 (a date which is so fresh in my memory that I could hardly\r\nforget it) a new island was suddenly formed by submarine eruption off\r\nthe coast of St. Michael's, to which the name of Sabrina was\r\nmomentarily given by your human geographers. It was about a mile around\r\nand 300 feet high; but, consisting as it did of loose cinders only, it\r\nwas soon washed away by the force of the waves in that stormy region. I\r\nmerely mention it here to show how recently volcanic changes have taken\r\nplace in my islands, and how continuously the internal energy has been\r\nat work modifying and re-arranging them.\r\n\r\nUp to the moment of the arrival of man in the archipelago the whole\r\npopulation, animal and vegetable, consisted entirely of these waifs and\r\nstrays, blown out to sea from Europe or Africa, and modified more or\r\nless on the spot in accordance with the varying needs of their new\r\nhome. But the advent of the obtrusive human species spoilt the game at\r\nonce for an independent observer. Man immediately introduced oranges,\r\nbananas, sweet potatoes, grapes, plums, almonds, and many other trees\r\nor shrubs, in which, for selfish reasons, he was personally interested.\r\nAt the same time he quite unconsciously and unintentionally stocked the\r\nislands with a fine vigorous crop of European weeds, so that the number\r\nof kinds of flowering plants included in the modern flora of my little\r\narchipelago exceeds, I think, by fully one-half that which I remember\r\nbefore the date of the Portuguese occupation. In the same way, besides\r\nhis domestic animals, this spoil-sport colonist man brought in his\r\ntrain accidentally rabbits, weasels, mice, and rats, which now abound\r\nin many parts of the group, so that the islands have now in effect a\r\nwild mammalian fauna. What is more odd, a small lizard has also got\r\nabout in the walls--not as you would imagine, a native-born Portuguese\r\nsubject, but of a kind found only in Madeira and Teneriffe, and, as far\r\nas I could make out at the time, it seemed to me to come over with\r\ncuttings of Madeira vines for planting at St. Michael's. It was about\r\nthe same time, I imagine, that eels and gold-fish first got loose from\r\nglass globes into the ponds and water-courses.\r\n\r\nI have forgotten to mention, what you will no doubt yourself long since\r\nhave inferred, that my archipelago is known among human beings in\r\nmodern times as the Azores; and also that traces of all these curious\r\nfacts of introduction and modification, which I have detailed here in\r\ntheir historical order, may still be detected by an acute observer and\r\nreasoner in the existing condition of the fauna and flora. Indeed, one\r\nof your own countrymen, Mr. Goodman, has collected all the most salient\r\nof these facts in his 'Natural History of the Azores,' and another of\r\nyour distinguished men of science, Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace, has given\r\nessentially the same explanations beforehand as those which I have here\r\nventured to lay, from another point of view, before a critical human\r\naudience. But while Mr. Wallace has arrived at them by a process of\r\narguing backward from existing facts to prior causes and probable\r\nantecedents, it occurred to me, who had enjoyed such exceptional\r\nopportunities of watching the whole process unfold itself from the very\r\nbeginning, that a strictly historical account of how I had seen it come\r\nabout, step after step, might possess for some of you a greater direct\r\ninterest than Mr. Wallace's inferential solution of the self-same\r\nproblem. If, through lapse of memory or inattention to detail at so\r\nremote a period, I have set down aught amiss, I sincerely trust you\r\nwill be kind enough to forgive me. But this little epic of the peopling\r\nof a single oceanic archipelago by casual strays, which I alone have\r\nhad the good fortune to follow through all its episodes, seemed to me\r\ntoo unique and valuable a chapter in the annals of life to be withheld\r\nentirely from the scientific world of your eager, ephemeral, nineteenth\r\ncentury humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TROPICAL EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nIf any one were to ask me (which is highly unlikely) 'In what\r\nuniversity would an intelligent young man do best to study?' I think I\r\nshould be very much inclined indeed to answer offhand, 'In the\r\nTropics.'\r\n\r\nNo doubt this advice sounds on first hearing just a trifle paradoxical;\r\nand no doubt, too, the proposed university has certain serious\r\ndrawbacks (like many others) on the various grounds of health, expense,\r\nfaith, and morals. Senior Proctors are unknown at Honolulu; Select\r\nPreachers don't range as far as the West Coast. But it has always\r\nseemed to me, nevertheless, that certain elements of a liberal\r\neducation are to be acquired tropically which can never be acquired in\r\na temperate, still less in an arctic or antarctic academy. This is more\r\nespecially true, I allow, in the particular cases of the biologist and\r\nthe sociologist; but it is also true in a somewhat less degree of the\r\nmere common arts course, and the mere average seeker after liberal\r\nculture. Vast aspects of nature and human life exist which can never\r\nadequately be understood aright except in tropical countries; vivid\r\nside-lights are cast upon our own history and the history of our globe\r\nwhich can never adequately be appreciated except beneath the searching\r\nand all too garish rays of a tropical sun.\r\n\r\nWhenever I meet a cultivated man who knows his Tropics--and more\r\nparticularly one who has known his Tropics during the formative period\r\nof mental development, say from eighteen to thirty--I feel\r\ninstinctively that he possesses certain keys of man and nature, certain\r\nclues to the problems of the world we live in, not possessed in\r\nanything like the same degree by the mere average annual output of\r\nOxford or of Heidelberg. I feel that we talk like Freemasons\r\ntogether--we of the Higher Brotherhood who have worshipped the sun,\r\n_præsentiorem deum_, in his own nearer temples.\r\n\r\nLet me begin by positing an extreme parallel. How obviously inadequate\r\nis the conception of life enjoyed by the ordinary Laplander or the most\r\nintelligent Fuegian! Suppose even he has attended the mission school of\r\nhis native village, and become learned there in all the learning of the\r\nEgyptians, up to the extreme level of the sixth standard, yet how\r\nfeeble must be his idea of the planet on which he moves! How much must\r\nhis horizon be cabined, cribbed, confined by the frost and snow, the\r\ngloom and poverty, of the bare land around him! He lives in a dark cold\r\nworld of scrubby vegetation and scant animal life: a world where human\r\nexistence is necessarily preserved only by ceaseless labour and at\r\nsevere odds; a world out of which all the noblest and most beautiful\r\nliving creatures have been ruthlessly pressed; a world where nothing\r\ngreat has been or can be; a world doomed by its mere physical\r\nconditions to eternal poverty, discomfort, and squalor. For green\r\nfields he has snow and reindeer moss: for singing birds and flowers,\r\nthe ptarmigan and the tundra. How can he ever form any fitting\r\nconception of the glory of life--of the means by which animal and\r\nvegetable organisms first grew and flourished? How can he frame to\r\nhimself any reasonable picture of civilised society, or of the origin\r\nand development of human faculty and human organisation?\r\n\r\nSomewhat the same, though of course in a highly mitigated degree, are\r\nthe disadvantages under which the pure temperate education labours,\r\nwhen compared with the education unconsciously drunk in at every pore\r\nby an intelligent mind in tropical climates. And fully to understand\r\nthis pregnant educational importance of the Tropics we must consider\r\nwith ourselves how large a part tropical conditions have borne in the\r\ndevelopment of life in general, and of human life and society in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nThe Tropics, we must carefully remember, are the norma of nature: the\r\nway things mostly are and always have been. They represent to us the\r\ncommon condition of the whole world during by far the greater part of\r\nits entire existence. Not only are they still in the strictest sense\r\nthe biological head-quarters: they are also the standard or central\r\ntype by which we must explain all the rest of nature, both in man and\r\nbeast, in plant and animal.\r\n\r\nThe temperate and arctic worlds, on the other hand, are a mere passing\r\naccident in the history of our planet: a hole-and-corner development; a\r\nspecial result of the great Glacial epoch, and of that vast slow\r\nsecular cooling which preceded and led up to it, from the beginning of\r\nthe Miocene or Mid-Tertiary period. Our European ideas, poor, harsh,\r\nand narrow, are mainly formed among a chilled and stunted fauna and\r\nflora, under inclement skies, and in gloomy days, all of which can give\r\nus but a very cramped and faint conception of the joyous exuberance,\r\nthe teeming vitality, the fierce hand-to-hand conflict, and the\r\nvictorious exultation of tropical life in its full free development.\r\n\r\nAll through the Primary and Secondary epochs of geology, it is now\r\npretty certain, hothouse conditions practically prevailed almost\r\nwithout a break over the whole world from pole to pole. It may be true,\r\nindeed, as Dr. Croli believes (and his reasoning on the point I confess\r\nis fairly convincing), that from time to time glacial periods in one or\r\nother hemisphere broke in for a while upon the genial warmth that\r\ncharacterised the greater part of those vast and immeasurable primæval\r\næons. But even if that were so--if at long intervals the world for some\r\nhours in its cosmical year was chilled and frozen in an insignificant\r\ncap at either extremity--these casual episodes in a long story do not\r\ninterfere with the general truth of the principle that life as a whole\r\nduring the greater portion of its antique existence has been carried on\r\nunder essentially tropical conditions. No matter what geological\r\nformation we examine, we find everywhere the same tale unfolded in\r\nplain inscriptions before our eyes. Take, for example, the giant\r\nclub-mosses and luxuriant tree-ferns nature-printed on shales of the\r\ncoal age in Britain: and we see in the wild undergrowth of those\r\npalæozoic forests ample evidence of a warm and almost West Indian\r\nclimate among the low basking islets of our northern carboniferous\r\nseas. Or take once more the oolitic epoch in England, lithographed on\r\nits own mud, with its puzzle-monkeys and its sago-palms, its crocodiles\r\nand its deinosaurs, its winged pterodactyls and its whale-like lizards.\r\nAll these huge creatures and these broad-leaved trees plainly indicate\r\nthe existence of a temperature over the whole of Northern Europe almost\r\nas warm as that of the Malay Archipelago in our own day. The weather\r\nreport for all the earlier ages stands almost uninterruptedly at Set\r\nFair.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, indeed, one may say that through the long series of\r\nPrimary and Secondary formations hardly a trace can be found of ice or\r\nsnow, autumn or winter, leafless boughs or pinched and starved\r\ndeciduous vegetation. Everything is powerful, luxuriant, vivid. Life,\r\nas Comus feared, was strangled with its waste fertility. Once, indeed,\r\nin the Permian Age, all over the temperate regions, north and south, we\r\nget passing indications of what seems very like a glacial epoch,\r\npartially comparable to that great glaciation on whose last fringe we\r\nstill abide to-day. But the Ice Age of the Permian, if such there were,\r\npassed away entirely, leaving the world once more warm and fruitful up\r\nto the very poles under conditions which we would now describe as\r\nessentially tropical.\r\n\r\nIt was with the Tertiary period--perhaps, indeed, only with the middle\r\nsubdivision of that period--that the gradual cooling of the polar and\r\nintermediate regions began. We know from the deposits of the chalk\r\nepoch in Greenland that late in Secondary times ferns, magnolias,\r\nmyrtles, and sago-palms--an Indian or Mexican flora--flourished\r\nexceedingly in what is now the dreariest and most ice-clad region of\r\nthe northern hemisphere. Later still, in the Eocene days, though the\r\nplants of Greenland had grown slightly more temperate in type, we still\r\nfind among the fossils, not only oaks, planes, vines, and walnuts, but\r\nalso wellingtonias like the big trees of California, Spanish chestnuts,\r\nquaint southern salisburias, broad-leaved liquidambars, and American\r\nsassafras. Nay, even in glacier-clad Spitzbergen itself, where the\r\ncharacter of the flora already begins to show signs of incipient\r\nchilling, we nevertheless see among the Eocene types such plants as the\r\nswamp-cyprus of the Carolinas and the wellingtonias of the Far West,\r\ntogether with a rich forest vegetation of poplars, birches, oaks,\r\nplanes, hazels, walnuts, water-lilies, and irises. As a whole, this\r\nvegetation still bespeaks a climate considerably more genial, mild, and\r\nequable than that of modern England.\r\n\r\nIt was in this basking world of the chalk and the Eocene that the great\r\nmammalian fauna first took its rise; it was in this easy world of\r\nfruits and sunshine that the primitive ancestors of man first began to\r\nwork upwards toward the distinctively human level of the palæolithic\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nBut then, in the mid-career of that third day of the geological drama,\r\ncame a frost--a nipping-frost; and slowly but surely the whole arctic\r\nand antarctic worlds were chilled and cramped, degree after degree, by\r\nthe gradual on-coming of the Great Ice Age. I am not going to deal here\r\nwith either the causes or the extent of that colossal cataclysm; I\r\nshall take all those for granted at present: what we are concerned with\r\nnow are the results it left behind--the changes which it wrought on\r\nfauna and flora and on human society. Especially is it of importance in\r\nthis connection to point out that the Glacial epoch is not yet entirely\r\nfinished--if, indeed, it is ever destined to be finished. We are living\r\nstill on the fringe of the Ice Age, in a cold and cheerless era, the\r\nlegacy of the accumulated glaciers of the northern and southern\r\nsnow-fields.\r\n\r\nIf once that ice were melted off--ah, well, there is much virtue in an\r\n_if_. Still, Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace seems to suggest somewhere that\r\nthe sun is gradually making inroads even now on those great\r\nglacier-sheets of the northern cap, just as we know he is doing on the\r\nsmaller glacier-sheets of Switzerland (most of which are receding), and\r\nthat in time perhaps (say in a hundred thousand years or so) warm ocean\r\ncurrents may once more penetrate to the very poles themselves. That,\r\nhowever, is neither here nor there. The fact remains that we of\r\nNorthern Europe live to-day in a cramped, chilled, contracted world; a\r\nworld from which all the larger, fiercer, and grander types have either\r\nbeen killed off or driven south; a world which stands to the full and\r\nvigorous world of the Eocene and Miocene periods in somewhat the same\r\nrelation as Lapland stands to-day to Italy or the Riviera.\r\n\r\nThis being so, it naturally results that if we want really to\r\nunderstand the history of life, its origin and its episodes, we must\r\nturn nowadays to that part of our planet which still most nearly\r\npreserves the original conditions--that is to say, the Tropics. And it\r\nhas always seemed to me, both _à priori_ and _à posteriori_, that the\r\nTropics on this account do really possess for every one of us a vast\r\nand for the most part unrecognised educational importance.\r\n\r\nI say 'for every one of us,' of deliberate design. I don't mean merely\r\nfor the biologist, though to him, no doubt, their value in this respect\r\nis greatest of all. Indeed, I doubt whether the very ideas of the\r\nstruggle for life, natural selection, the survival of the fittest,\r\nwould ever have occurred at all to the stay-at-home naturalists of the\r\nLinnæan epoch. It was in the depths of Brazilian forests, or under the\r\nbroad shade of East Indian palms, that those fertile conceptions first\r\nflashed independently upon two southern explorers. It is very\r\nnoteworthy indeed that all the biologists who have done most to\r\nrevolutionise the science of life in our own day--Darwin, Huxley,\r\nWallace, Bates, Fritz Müller, and Belt--have without exception formed\r\ntheir notions of the plant and animal world during tropical travels in\r\nearly life. No one can read the 'Voyage of the _Beagle_,' the\r\n'Naturalist on the Amazons,' or the 'Malay Archipelago' without feeling\r\nat every page how profoundly the facts of tropical nature had\r\npenetrated and modified their authors' minds. On the other hand, it is\r\nwell worth while to notice that the formal opposition to the new and\r\nmore expansive evolutionary views came mainly from the museum and\r\nlaboratory type of naturalists in London and Paris, the official\r\nexponents of dry bones, who knew nature only through books and\r\npreserved specimens, or through her impoverished and far less plastic\r\ndevelopments in northern lands. The battle of organic evolution has\r\nbeen waged by the Darwins, the Huxleys, and the Müllers on the one\r\nhand, against the Cuviers, the Owens, and the Virchows on the other.\r\n\r\nStill, it is not only in biology, as I said just now, that a taste of\r\nthe Tropics in early life exerts a marked widening and philosophic\r\ninfluence upon a man's whole mental horizon. In ten thousand ways, in\r\nthat great tropical university, men feel themselves in closer touch\r\nthan elsewhere with the ultimate facts and truths of nature. I don't\r\nknow whether it is all fancy and preconceived opinion, but I often\r\nimagine when I talk with new-met men that I can detect a certain\r\ndifference in tone and feeling at first sight between those who have\r\nand those who have not passed the Tropical Tripos. In the Tropics, in\r\nshort, we seem to get down to the very roots of things. Thousands of\r\nquestions, social, political, economical, ethical, present themselves\r\nat once in new and more engagingly simple aspects. Difficulties vanish,\r\ndistinctions disappear, conventions fade, clothes are reduced to their\r\nleast common measure, man stands forth in his native nakedness. Things\r\nthat in the North we had come to regard as inevitable--garments,\r\nfiring, income tax, morality--evaporate or simplify themselves with\r\ninstructive ease and phantasmagoric readiness. Malthus and the food\r\nquestion assume fresh forms, as in dissolving views, before our very\r\neyes. How are slums conceivable or East Ends possible where every man\r\ncan plant his own yam and cocoa-nut, and reap their fruit\r\nfour-hundred-fold? How can Mrs. Grundy thrive where every woman may\r\nrear her own ten children on her ten-rood plot without aid or\r\nassistance from their indeterminate fathers? What need of carpentry\r\nwhere a few bamboos, cut down at random, can be fastened together with\r\nthongs into a comfortable chair? What use of pottery where calabashes\r\nhang on every tree, and cocoa-nuts, with the water fresh and pure\r\nwithin, supply at once the cup, and the filter, and the Apollinaris\r\nwithin?\r\n\r\nOf course I don't mean to assert, either, that this tropical university\r\nwill in itself suffice for all the needs of educated or rather of\r\neducable men. It must be taken, _bien entendu_, as a supplementary\r\ncourse to the Literæ Humaniores. There are things which can only be\r\nlearnt in the crowded haunts and cities of men--in London, Paris, New\r\nYork, Vienna. There are things which can only be learnt in the centres\r\nof culture or of artistic handicraft--in Oxford, Munich, Florence,\r\nVenice, Rome. There is only one Grand Canal and only one Pitti Palace.\r\nWe must have Shakespeare, Homer, Catullus, Dante; we must have Phidias,\r\nFra Angelico, Rafael, Mendelssohn; we must have Aristotle, Newton,\r\nLaplace, Spencer. But after all these, and before all these, there is\r\nsomething more left to learn. Having first read them, we must read\r\nourselves out of them. We must forget all this formal modern life; we\r\nmust break away from this cramped, cold, northern world; we must find\r\nourselves face to face at last, in Pacific isles or African forests,\r\nwith the underlying truths of simple naked nature. For that, in its\r\nperfection, we must go to the Tropics; and there, we shall learn and\r\nunlearn much, coming back, no doubt, with shattered faiths and broken\r\ngods, and strangely disconcerted European prejudices, but looking out\r\nupon life with a new outlook, an outlook undimmed by ten thousand\r\npreconceptions which hem in the vision and obstruct the view of the\r\nmere temperately educated.\r\n\r\nNor is it only on the _élite_ of the world that this tropical training\r\nhas in its own way a widening influence. It is good, of course, for our\r\nGaltons to have seen South Africa; good for our Tylors to have studied\r\nMexico; good for our Hookers to have numbered the rhododendrons and\r\ndeodars of the Himalayas. I sometimes fancy, even, that in the works of\r\nour very greatest stay-at-home thinkers on anthropological or\r\nsociological subjects, I detect here and there a certain formalist and\r\nschematic note which betrays the want of first-hand acquaintance with\r\nthe plastic and expansive nature of tropical society. The beliefs and\r\nrelations of the actual savage have not quite that definiteness of form\r\nand expression which our University Professors would fain assign to\r\nthem. But apart from the widening influence of the Tropics on these\r\npicked minds, there is a widening influence exerted insensibly on the\r\nvery planters or merchants, the rank and file of European settlers,\r\nwhich can hardly fail to impress all those who have lived amongst them.\r\nThe cramping effect of the winter cold and the artificial life is all\r\nremoved. Men live in a freer, wider, warmer air; their doors and\r\nwindows stand open day and night; the scent of flowers and the hum of\r\ninsects blow in upon them with every breeze; their brother man and\r\nsister woman are more patent in every action to their eyes; the world\r\nshows itself more frankly; it has fewer secrets, and readier\r\nsympathies. I don't mean to say the result is all gain. Far from it.\r\nThere are evils inherent in tropical life which, as a noble lord\r\nremarks of nature generally, \"no preacher can heal.\" But viewed as\r\neducation, like Saint-Simon's thieving, it is all valuable. I should\r\nthink most men who have once passed through a tropical experience would\r\nno more wish that full chapter blotted out of their lives than they\r\nwould consent to lose their university culture, their Continental\r\ntravel, or their literary, scientific, or artistic education.\r\n\r\nAnd what are the elements of this tropical curriculum which give it\r\nsuch immense educational value? I think they are manifold. A few only\r\nmay be selected as of typical importance.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, because first in order of realisation, there is its\r\nvalue as a mental _bouleversement_, a revolution in ideas, a sort of\r\nmoral and intellectual cold shower-bath, a nervous shock to the system\r\ngenerally. The patient or pupil gets so thoroughly upset in all his\r\npreconceived ideas; he finds all round him a life so different from the\r\nlife to which he has been accustomed in colder regions, that he wakes\r\nup suddenly, rubs his eyes hard, and begins to look about him for some\r\ngeneral explanation of the world he lives in. It is good for the\r\nordinary man to get thus unceremoniously upset. Take the average young\r\nintelligence of the London streets, with its glib ideas already formed\r\nfrom supply and demand in a civilised country, where soil is\r\nappropriated, and classes distinct, and commodities drop as it were\r\nfrom the clouds upon the middle-class breakfast-table--take such an\r\nintelligence, self-satisfied and empty, and place its possessor all at\r\nonce in a new environment, where everything material, mental, and moral\r\nseems topsy-turvy, where life is real and morals are rudimentary--and\r\nunless he is a very particular fool indeed, what a lot you must really\r\ngive that blithe new-comer to turn over and think about! The sun that\r\nshifts now north, now south of him; the seasons that go by fours\r\ninstead of twos; the trees that blossom and bear fruit from January to\r\nDecember, with no apparent regard for the calendar months as by law\r\nestablished; the black, brown, or yellow people, who know not his creed\r\nor his social code; the castes and cross-divisions that puzzle and\r\nsurprise him; the pride and the scruples, deeper than those of\r\ncivilised life, but that nevertheless run counter to his own; the\r\neconomic conditions that defy his preconceptions; the virtues and the\r\nvices that equally rub him up the wrong way--all these things are\r\nhighly conducive to the production of that first substratum of\r\nphilosophic thinking, a Socratic attitude of supreme ignorance, a pure\r\nCartesian frame of universal doubt.\r\n\r\nThen again there is the marvellous exuberance and novelty of the fauna\r\nand flora. And this once more has something better for us all than mere\r\nspecialist interest. Sugar and ginger grow for all alike. For we must\r\nremember that not only do the Tropics represent the vastly greater\r\nportion of the world's past: they also represent the vastly greater\r\nportion of the world's present. By far the larger part of the land\r\nsurface of the earth is tropical or subtropical; the temperate and\r\narctic regions make up but a minor and unimportant fraction of the soil\r\nof our planet. And if we include the sea as well, this truth becomes\r\neven more strikingly evident: the Tropics are even now the rule of\r\nlife; the colder regions are but an abnormal and outlying eccentricity\r\nof nature. Yet it is from this starved and dwarfed and impoverished\r\nnorthern area that most of us have formed our views of life, to the\r\ntotal exclusion of the wider, richer, more varied world that calls for\r\nour admiration in tropical latitudes.\r\n\r\nInsensibly this richness and vividness of nature all around one, on a\r\nfirst visit to the Tropics, sinks into one's mind, and produces\r\nprofound, though at first unconscious, modifications in one's whole\r\nmode of regarding man and his universe. Especially is this the case in\r\nearly life, when the character is still plastic and the eye still keen:\r\npictures are formed in that brilliant sunshine and under those dim\r\narches of hot grey sky that photograph themselves for ever on the\r\nlasting tablets of the human memory. John Stuart Mill in his\r\nAutobiography dwells lovingly, I remember, on the profound effect\r\nproduced on himself by his childish visits to Jeremy Bentham at Ford\r\nAbbey in Dorsetshire, on the delightful sense of space and freedom and\r\ngenerous expansion given to his mind by the mere act of living and\r\nmoving in those stately halls and wide airy gardens. Every university\r\nman must look back with pleasure of somewhat the same sort to the free\r\nbreezy memories of the quadrangles and common rooms of Christ Church or\r\nof Trinity. But in the tropical university everybody passes his time in\r\narcades of Greek or Pompeian airiness: the palm-trees wave and whisper\r\naround his head as he sits for coolness on his wide verandah; the\r\nhumming-birds dart from flower to flower on the delicate bouquets that\r\ncrowd his drawing-room. I knew a lady who made a capital collection of\r\nbutterflies and moths at her own dinner-table by simply impounding in\r\npaper boxes the insects that flitted about the lamp at dessert. Why, if\r\nit comes to that, the very bread itself comprises generally a whole\r\nentomological cabinet, and contains in fragments the _disjecta membra_\r\nof specimens enough to stock entire glass cases at severe South\r\nKensington. How's that for an inducement to study life where it is\r\nrichest and most abundant in its native starting-place?\r\n\r\nBut above all in educational importance I rank the advantage of seeing\r\nhuman nature in its primitive surroundings, far from the squalid and\r\nchilly influences of the tail-end of the Glacial epoch. I admit at once\r\nthat cold has done much, exceeding much, for human development--has\r\nbeen the mother of civilisation in somewhat the same sense that\r\nnecessity has been the mother of invention. To it, no doubt, we owe to\r\na great extent, in varying stages, clothing, the house, fire, the\r\nsteam-engine. Yet none the less is it true that the first levels of\r\nsociety must needs have been passed under essentially tropical\r\nconditions, and that nascent civilisation spread but slowly northward,\r\nfrom Egypt and Asia, through Greece and Italy, to the cloudy regions\r\nwhere its chief centres are at present domiciled under canopies of coal\r\nsmoke. And even to-day the sight of the tropics, green and luxuriant,\r\nbrings us into touch at once with earlier ideas and habits of the\r\nrace--makes us more able not only to understand, but also to sympathise\r\nwith, our ancient ancestors of the naked-and-not-ashamed era of\r\nculture. Views formed exclusively in the North tend too much to imitate\r\nthe reduced gentlewoman's outlook upon life; views formed in the\r\nTropics correct this refractive influence by a certain genial and\r\ntolerant virile expansion, not to be learned at the Common, Clapham.\r\n\r\nTo one whose economic pendulum has hitherto oscillated between selfish\r\nluxury in Mayfair and squalid poverty in Seven Dials, there is indeed a\r\nworld of novelty in the first view of the tropical poverty that is not\r\nsqualid but contentedly luxurious--of the dusky father with his wife or\r\nwives (the mere number is a detail) sprawling at full length, half\r\nclad, in the eye of the sun, before the palm-thatched hut, while the\r\nfat black babies and the fat black little pigs wallow together almost\r\nindistinguishably in the dust at his side, just out of reach of the\r\nmuscular foot that might otherwise of pure wantonness molest them. What\r\na flood of light it all casts upon the future possibilities of society,\r\nthat leisured, cultureless household, on whose garden-plot yam or\r\nbread-fruit or bananas or sweet potatoes can be grown in sufficient\r\nquantity to support the family without more labour than in England\r\nwould pay for its kitchen coals; where the hut is but a shelter from\r\nrain, or a bed-curtain for night, and where the untaxed sun supplies\r\nthe place of a drawing-room fire all the year round, and warms the\r\nwater for the baby's bath at nothing the gallon! If there is any man\r\nwho doesn't sympathise with his dusky brother when he sees him thus at\r\nhome in his airy palace--any man who doesn't fraternise closely with\r\nhis kind when thus brought face to face with our primitive existence, I\r\ndon't envy him his stern and wild Caledonian ethics. The beach-comber\r\ninstinct should be strong in all sane minds. Or if that blunt way of\r\nputting it perchance offend the weaker brethren, let us say rather, the\r\nspirit of the Lotus-eaters. For the man who doesn't want to eat of the\r\nLotus just once in his life has become too civilised: the iron of the\r\nGradgrind era of universal competition and payment by results has\r\nentered to deeply into his sordid soul. He wants a course of Egypt and\r\nTahiti.\r\n\r\nOh, yes; I know what you are going to object, and I grant it at once:\r\nthe influence of the Tropics is by no means an ascetic one. They, tend\r\nrather to encourage a certain genial and friendly tolerance of all\r\npossible human forms of society--even the lowest. They are essentially\r\ndemocratic, not to say socialistic and revolutionary in tone. By\r\nbringing us all down to the underlying verities of life, apart from its\r\nconventions, they beget perhaps a somewhat hasty impatience of Court\r\ndress and the Lord Chamberlain's regulations. But, _per contra_, they\r\nteach us to feel that every man, whether black, brown, or white, is\r\nvery human, and every woman and child, if possible, even a trifle more\r\nso. Wicked as it all is, there is yet in tropical political economy\r\nmore of the Gospel according to St. John, and less of Adam Smith,\r\nRicardo, and Malthus, than in any orthodox political economy prescribed\r\nby examiners for the University of London. It is something to see a\r\nworld where ceaseless toil is not the necessary and inevitable lot of\r\nall who don't pay income tax on a thousand a year, even if Board\r\nschools are unknown and quadratic equations a vanishing quantity. It is\r\nsomething to see a stick of sugar-cane protruding from the mouth of\r\nevery child, and oranges retailed at twelve for a ha'penny. It is\r\nsomething to know how the vast majority of the human race still live\r\nand move and have their being, and to feel that after all their mode of\r\nlife, though lacking in Greek iambics, wallpapers, and the _Saturday\r\nReview_, yet appeals in its own beach-comberish way to some of one's\r\ninmost and deepest yearnings. The hibiscus that flames before the\r\nwattled hut, the parrot that chatters from the green and golden\r\nmango-tree, the lithe, healthy figures of the children in the stream,\r\nare some compensation for the lack of London mud, London fog, and\r\nLondon illustrations of practical Christianity in the Isle of Dogs and\r\nthe Bermondsey purlieus. I don't know whether I am knocking the last\r\nnail into the completed coffin of my own contention, but I believe\r\nevery right-minded man returns from the Tropics a good deal more of a\r\nCommunist than when he went there.\r\n\r\nOne word of explanation to prevent mistake. I am not myself, like\r\nKingsley or Wallace, an enthusiastic tropicist. On the contrary, viewed\r\nas a place of permanent residence, I don't at all like the Tropics to\r\nlive in. I am pleading here only for their educational value, in small\r\ndoses. Spending two or three years there in the heyday of life is very\r\nmuch like reading Herodotus--a thing one is glad one had once to do,\r\nbut one would never willingly do again for any money. We northern\r\ncreatures are remote products of the Great Ice Age, and by this time,\r\nlike Polar bears, we have grown adapted to our glacial environment. All\r\nthe more, therefore, is it a useful shaking-up for us to get\r\ntransported bodily from our cramped and poverty-stricken northern\r\nslums, just once in our life, to the palms and temples of the South,\r\nthe lands where the human body is a hardy plant, not a frail exotic. We\r\ncome back to our chilly home among the fogs and bogs with wider\r\nprojects for the thawing down of the social ice-heap, and the\r\nintroduction of the bread-fruit-tree and the currant-bun-bush into the\r\nremotest wilds of the borough of Hackney. I am not even quite sure that\r\ntropical experience doesn't predispose us somewhat in favour of\r\nplanting the sweet potato instead of grazing battering-rams in the\r\nuplands of Connemara. But hush; I hear an editorial frown. No more of\r\nthis heresy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND.\r\n\r\nOf course, you know my friend the squirting cucumber. If you don't,\r\nthat can be only because you've never looked in the right place to find\r\nhim. On all waste ground outside most southern cities--Nice, Cannes,\r\nFlorence: Rome, Algiers, Granada: Athens, Palermo, Tunis, where you\r\nwill--the soil is thickly covered by dark trailing vines which bear on\r\ntheir branches a queer hairy green fruit, much like a common cucumber\r\nat that early stage of its existence when we know it best in the\r\ncommercial form of pickled gherkins. As long as you don't interfere\r\nwith them, these hairy green fruits do nothing out of the common in the\r\nway of personal aggressiveness. Like the model young lady of the books\r\non etiquette, they don't speak unless they're spoken to. But if\r\nperadventure you chance to brush up against the plant accidentally, or\r\nyou irritate it of set purpose with your foot or your cane, then, as\r\nMr. Rider Haggard would say, 'a strange thing happens': off jumps the\r\nlittle green fruit with a startling bounce, and scatters its juice and\r\npulp and seeds explosively through a hole in the end where the stem\r\njoined on to it. The entire central part of the cucumber, in short\r\n(answering to the seeds and pulp of a ripe melon), squirts out\r\nelastically through the breach in the outer wall, leaving the hollow\r\nshell behind as a mere empty windbag.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the squirting cucumber knows its own business best, and is\r\nnot without sufficient reasons of its own for this strange and, to some\r\nextent, unmannerly behaviour. By its queer trick of squirting, it\r\nmanages to kill at least two birds with one stone. For, in the first\r\nplace, the sudden elastic jump of the fruit frightens away browsing\r\nanimals, such as goats and cattle. Those meditative ruminants are\r\nlittle accustomed to finding shrubs or plants take the aggressive\r\nagainst them; and when they see a fruit that quite literally flies in\r\ntheir faces of its own accord, they hesitate to attack the uncanny vine\r\nwhich bristles with such magical and almost miraculous defences.\r\nMoreover, the juice of the squirting cucumber is bitter and nauseous,\r\nand if it gets into the eyes or nostrils of man or beast, it impresses\r\nitself on the memory by stinging like red pepper. So the trick of\r\nsquirting serves in a double way as a protection to the plant against\r\nthe attacks of herbivorous animals and other enemies.\r\n\r\nBut that's not all. Even when no enemy is near, the ripe fruits at last\r\ndrop off of themselves, and scatter their seeds elastically in every\r\ndirection. This they do simply in order to disseminate their kind in\r\nnew and unoccupied spots, where the seedlings will root and find an\r\nopening in life for themselves. Observe, indeed, that the very word\r\n'disseminate' implies a general vague recognition of this principle of\r\nplant-life on the part of humanity. It means, etymologically, to\r\nscatter seed; and it points to the fact that everywhere in nature seeds\r\nare scattered broadcast, infinite pains being taken by the mother-plant\r\nfor their general diffusion over wide areas of woodland, plain, or\r\nprairie.\r\n\r\nLet us take as examples a single little set of instances, familiar to\r\neverybody, but far commoner in the world at large than the inhabitants\r\nof towns are at all aware of: I mean, the winged seeds, that fly about\r\nfreely in the air by means of feathery hairs or gossamer, like\r\nthistle-down and dandelion. Of these winged types we have many hundred\r\nvarieties in England alone. All the willow-herbs, for example, have\r\nsuch feathery seeds (or rather fruits) to help them on their way\r\nthrough life; and one kind, the beautiful pink rose-bay, flies about so\r\nreadily, and over such wide spaces of open country, that the plant is\r\nknown to farmers in America as fireweed, because it always springs up\r\nat once over whole square miles of charred and smoking soil after every\r\ndevastating forest fire. It travels fast, for it travels like Ariel. In\r\nmuch the same way, the coltsfoot grows on all new English railway\r\nbanks, because its winged seeds are wafted everywhere in myriads on the\r\nwinds of March. All the willows and poplars have also winged seeds: so\r\nhave the whole vast tribe of hawkweeds, groundsels, ragworts, thistles,\r\nfleabanes, cat's-ears, dandelions, and lettuces. Indeed, one may say\r\nroughly, there are very few plants of any size or importance in the\r\neconomy of nature which don't deliberately provide, in one way or\r\nanother, for the dispersal and dissemination of their fruits or\r\nseedlings.\r\n\r\nWhy is this? Why isn't the plant content just to let its grains or\r\nberries drop quietly on to the soil beneath, and there shift for\r\nthemselves as best they may on their own resources?\r\n\r\nThe answer is a more profound one than you would at first imagine.\r\nPlants discovered the grand principle of the rotation of crops long\r\nbefore man did. The farmer now knows that if he sows wheat or turnips\r\ntoo many years running on the same plot, he 'exhausts the soil,' as we\r\nsay--deprives it of certain special mineral or animal constituents\r\nneedful for that particular crop, and makes the growth of the plant,\r\ntherefore, feeble or even impossible. To avoid this misfortune, he lets\r\nthe land lie fallow, or varies his crops from year to year according to\r\na regular and deliberate cycle. Well, natural selection forced the same\r\ndiscovery upon the plants themselves long before the farmer had dreamed\r\nof its existence. For plants, being, in the strictest sense, 'rooted to\r\nthe spot,' absolutely require that all their needs should be supplied\r\nquite locally. Hence, from the very beginning, those plants which\r\nscattered their seeds widest throve the best; while those which merely\r\ndropped them on the ground under their own shadow, and on soil\r\nexhausted by their own previous demands upon it, fared ill in the\r\nstruggle for life against their more discursive competitors. The result\r\nhas been that in the long run few species have survived, except those\r\nwhich in one way or another arranged beforehand for the dispersal of\r\ntheir seeds and fruits over fresh and unoccupied areas of plain or\r\nhillside.\r\n\r\nI don't, of course, by any means intend to assert that seeds always do\r\nit by the simple device of wings or feathery projections. Every variety\r\nof plan or dodge or expedient has been adopted in turn to secure the\r\nself-same end; and provided only it succeeds in securing it, any\r\nvariety of them all is equally satisfactory. One might parallel it with\r\nthe case of hatching birds' eggs. Most birds sit upon their eggs\r\nthemselves, and supply the necessary warmth from their own bodies. But\r\nany alternative plan that attains the same end does just as well. The\r\nfelonious cuckoo drops her foundlings unawares in another bird's nest:\r\nthe ostrich trusts her unhatched offspring to the heat of the burning\r\ndesert sand: and the Australian brush-turkeys, with vicarious maternal\r\ninstinct, collect great mounds of decaying and fermenting leaves and\r\nrubbish, in which they deposit their eggs to be artificially incubated,\r\nas it were, by the slow heat generated in the process of putrefaction.\r\nJust in the same way, we shall see in the case of seeds that any method\r\nof dispersion will serve the plant's purpose equally well, provided\r\nonly it succeeds in carrying a few of the young seedlings to a proper\r\nplace in which they may start fair at last in the struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the fertilization of flowers, so in that of the\r\ndispersal of seeds, there are two main ways in which the work is\r\neffected--by animals and by wind-power. I will not insult the\r\nintelligence of the reader at the present time of day by telling him\r\nthat pollen is usually transferred from blossom to blossom in one or\r\nother of these two chief ways--it is carried on the heads or bodies of\r\nbees and other honey-seeking insects, or else it is wafted on the wings\r\nof the wind to the sensitive surface of a sister-flower. So, too, seeds\r\nare for the most part either dispersed by animals or blown about by the\r\nbreezes of heaven to new situations. These are the two most obvious\r\nmeans of locomotion provided by nature; and it is curious to see that\r\nthey have both been utilized almost equally by plants, alike for their\r\npollen and their seeds, just as they have been utilized by man for his\r\nown purposes on sea or land, in ship, or windmill, or pack-horse, or\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways in which animals may be employed to disperse\r\nseeds--voluntarily and involuntarily. They may be compelled to carry\r\nthem against their wills: or they may be bribed and cajoled and\r\nflattered into doing the plant's work for it in return for some\r\nsubstantial advantage or benefit the plant confers upon them. The first\r\nplan is the one adopted by burrs and cleavers. These adhesive fruits\r\nare like the man who buttonholes you and won't be shaken off: they are\r\nprovided with little curved hooks or bent and barbed hairs which catch\r\nupon the wool of sheep, the coat of cattle, or the nether integuments\r\nof wayfaring humanity, and can't be got rid of without some little\r\ndifficulty. Most of them, you will find on examination, belonged to\r\nconfirmed hedgerow or woodside plants: they grow among bushes or low\r\nscrub, and thickets of gorse or bramble. Now, to such plants as these,\r\nit is obviously useful to have adhesive fruits and seeds: for when\r\nsheep or other animals get them caught in their coats, they carry them\r\naway to other bushy spots, and there, to get rid of the annoyance\r\ncaused by the foreign body, scratch them off at once against some\r\nholly-bush or blackthorn. You may often find seeds of this type\r\nsticking on thorns as the nucleus of a little matted mass of wool, so\r\nleft by the sheep in the very spots best adapted for the free growth of\r\ntheir vigorous seedlings.\r\n\r\nEven among plants which trust to the involuntary services of animals in\r\ndispersing their seeds, a great many varieties of detail may be\r\nobserved on close inspection. For example, in hound's-tongue and\r\ngoose-grass, two of the best-known instances among our common English\r\nweeds, each little nut is covered with many small hooks, which make it\r\ncatch on firmly by several points of attachment to passing animals.\r\nThese are the kinds we human beings of either sex oftenest find\r\nclinging to our skirts or trousers after a walk in a rabbit-warren. But\r\nin herb-bennet and avens each nut has a single long awn, crooked near\r\nthe middle with a very peculiar S-shaped joint, which effectually\r\ncatches on to the wool or hair, but drops at the elbow after a short\r\nperiod of withering. Sometimes, too, the whole fruit is provided with\r\nprehensile hooks, while sometimes it is rather the individual seeds\r\nthemselves that are so accommodated. Oddest of all is the plan followed\r\nby the common burdock. Here, an involucre or common cup-shaped\r\nreceptacle of hooked bracts surrounds an entire head of purple tubular\r\nflowers, and each of these flowers produces in time a distinct fruit;\r\nbut the hooked involucre contains the whole compound mass, and, being\r\npulled off bodily by a stray sheep or dog, effects the transference of\r\nthe composite lot at once to some fitting place for their germination.\r\n\r\nThose plants, on the other hand, which depend rather, like London\r\nhospitals, upon the voluntary system, produce that very familiar form\r\nof edible capsule which we commonly call in the restricted sense a\r\nfruit or berry. In such cases, the seed-vessel is usually swollen and\r\npulpy: it is stored with sweet juices to attract the birds or other\r\nanimal allies, and it is brightly coloured so as to advertise to their\r\neyes the presence of the alluring sugary foodstuff. These instances,\r\nhowever, are now so familiar to everybody that I won't dwell upon them\r\nat any length. Even the degenerate schoolboy of the present day, much\r\nas he has declined from the high standard set forth by Macaulay, knows\r\nall about the way the actual seed itself is covered (as in the plum or\r\nthe cherry) by a hard stony coat which 'resists the action of the\r\ngastric juice' (so physiologists put it, with their usual frankness),\r\nand thus passes undigested through the body of its swallower. All I\r\nwill do here, therefore, is to note very briefly that some edible\r\nfruits, like the two just mentioned, as well as the apricot, the peach,\r\nthe nectarine, and the mango, consist of a single seed with its outer\r\ncovering; in others, as in the raspberry, the blackberry, the\r\ncloudberry, and the dew-berry, many seeds are massed together, each\r\nwith a separate edible pulp; in yet others, as in the gooseberry, the\r\ncurrant, the grape, and the whortleberry, several seeds are embedded\r\nwithin the fruit in a common pulpy mass; and in others again, as in the\r\napple, pear, quince, and medlar, they are surrounded by a quantity of\r\nspongy edible flesh. Indeed, the variety that prevails among fruits in\r\nthis respect almost defies classification: for sometimes, as in the\r\nmulberry, the separate little fruits of several distinct flowers grow\r\ntogether at last into a common berry: sometimes, as in a fig, the\r\ngeneral flower-stalk of several tiny one-seeded blossoms forms the\r\nedible part: and sometimes, as in the strawberry, the true little nuts\r\nor fruits appear as mere specks or dots on the bloated surface of the\r\nswollen and overgrown stem, which forms the luscious morsel dear to the\r\nhuman palate.\r\n\r\nYet in every case it is interesting to observe that, while the seeds\r\nwhich depend for dispersion upon the breeze are easily detached from\r\nthe parent plant and blown about by every wind of doctrine, the seeds\r\nor fruits which depend for their dispersion upon birds or animals\r\nalways, on the contrary, hang on to their native boughs to the very\r\nlast, till some unconscious friend pecks them off and devours them.\r\nHaws, rose-hips, and holly-berries will wither and wilt on the tree in\r\nmild winters, because they can't drop off of themselves without the aid\r\nof birds, while the birds are too well supplied with other food to care\r\nfor them. One of the strangest cases of all, however, is that of the\r\nmistletoe, which, living parasitically upon the forest-boughs and\r\napple-trees, would of course be utterly lost if its berries dropped\r\ntheir seeds on to the ground beneath it. To avoid such a misfortune,\r\nthe mistletoe berries are filled with an exceedingly viscid and sticky\r\npulp, surrounding the hard little nut-like seeds: and this pulp makes\r\nthe seeds cling to the bills and feet of various birds which feed upon\r\nthe fruit, but most particularly of the missel thrush, who derives his\r\ncommon English name from his devotion to the mistletoe. The birds then\r\ncarry them away unwittingly to some neighbouring tree, and rub them\r\noff, when they get uncomfortable, against a forked branch--the exact\r\nspots that best suits the young mistletoe for sprouting in. Man, in\r\nturn, makes use of the sticky pulp for the manufacture of bird-lime,\r\nand so employs against the birds the very qualities which the plant\r\nintended as a bribe for their kindly services.\r\n\r\nAmong seeds that trust for their disposal to the wind, the commonest,\r\nsimplest, and least evolved type is that of the ordinary capsule, as in\r\nthe poppies and campions. At first sight, to be sure, a casual observer\r\nmight suppose there existed in these cases no recognisable device at\r\nall for the dissemination of the seedlings. But you and I, most\r\nexcellent and discreet reader, are emphatically _not_, of course, mere\r\ncasual observers. _We_ look close, and go to the very root of things.\r\nAnd when we do so, we see for ourselves at once that almost all\r\ncapsules open--where? why, at the top, so that the seeds can only be\r\nshaken out when there is a high enough wind blowing to sway the stems\r\nto and fro with some violence, and scatter the small black grains\r\ninside to a considerable distance. Furthermore, in many instances, of\r\nwhich the common poppy-head is an excellent example, the capsule opens\r\nby lateral pores at the top of a flat head--a further precaution which\r\nallows the seeds to get out only by a few at a time, after a distinct\r\njerk, and so scatters them pretty evenly, with different winds, over a\r\nwide circular space around the mother plant. Experiment will show how\r\nthis simple dodge works. Try to shake out the poppy-seed from a ripe\r\npoppy-head on the plant as it grows, without breaking the stem or\r\nbending it unnaturally, and you will easily see how much force of wind\r\nis required in order to put this unobtrusive but very effective\r\nmechanism into working order.\r\n\r\nThe devices of this character employed by various plants for the\r\ndispersal of seeds even in ordinary dry capsules are far too numerous\r\nfor me to describe in full detail, though they form a delightful\r\nsubject for individual study in any small suburban garden. I will only\r\ngive one more illustrative case, just to show the sort of point an\r\namateur should always be on the look-out for. There is an extremely\r\ncommon, though inconspicuous, English weed, the mouse-ear chickweed,\r\nfound everywhere in flower-beds or grass-plots, however small, and\r\nnoticeable for its quaint little horn-shaped capsules. These have a\r\nvery odd sort of twist or cock-up in the middle, just above the part\r\nwhere the seeds lie; and they open at the top by ten small teeth,\r\npointed obliquely outward for no apparent reason. Yet every point has a\r\nmeaning of its own for all that. The plant is one that lies rather\r\nclose upon the ground; and the effect of this twist in the capsule is\r\nthat the seeds, which are relatively heavy, and well stored with\r\nnutriment, can never get out at all, unless a very strong wind is\r\nblowing, which sweeps over the herbage in long quick waves, and carries\r\neverything it shakes out for great distances before it. So much design\r\nhave even the smallest weeds put into the mechanism for the dispersion\r\nof their precious seeds, the hope of their race and the earnest of\r\ntheir future!\r\n\r\nArtillery marks a higher stage than the sling and the stone. Just so,\r\nin many plants, a step higher in the evolutionary scale as regards the\r\nmethod of dispersion, the capsule itself bursts open explosively, and\r\nscatters its contents to the four winds of heaven. Such plants may be\r\nsaid to discharge their grains on the principle of the bow and arrow.\r\nThe balsam is a familiar example of this startling mode of moving to\r\nfresh fields and pastures new: its capsule consists of five long\r\nstraight valves, which break asunder elastically the moment they are\r\ntouched, when fully ripe, and shed their seeds on all sides, like so\r\nmany small bombshells. Our friend the squirting cucumber, which served\r\nas the prime text for this present discourse, falls into somewhat the\r\nsame category, though in other ways it rather resembles the true\r\nsucculent fruits, and belongs, indeed, to the same family as the melon,\r\nthe gourd, the pumpkin, and the vegetable-marrow, almost all of which\r\nare edible and in every way fruit-like. Among English weeds, the little\r\nbittercress that grows on dry walls and hedge-banks forms an excellent\r\nexample of the same device. Village children love to touch the long,\r\nripe, brown capsules on the top with one timid finger, and then jump\r\naway, half laughing, half terrified, when the mild-looking little plant\r\ngoes off suddenly with a small bang and shoots its grains like a\r\ncatapult point-blank in their faces.\r\n\r\nIt is in the tropics, however, that these elastic fruits reach their\r\nhighest development. There they have to fight, not merely against such\r\nsmall fry as robins, squirrels, and harvest-mice, but against the\r\naggressive parrot, the hard-billed toucan, the persistent lemur, and\r\nthe inquisitive monkey. Moreover, the elastic fruits of the tropics\r\ngrow often on spreading forest trees, and must therefore shed their\r\nseeds to immense distances if they are to reach comparatively virgin\r\nsoil, unexhausted by the deep-set roots of the mother trunk. Under such\r\nexceptional circumstances, the tropical examples of these elastic\r\ncapsules are by no means mere toys to be lightly played with by babes\r\nand sucklings. The sand-box tree of the West Indies has large round\r\nfruits, containing seeds about as big as an English horsebean; and the\r\ncapsule explodes, when ripe, with a detonation like a pistol,\r\nscattering its contents with as much violence as a shot from an\r\nair-gun. It is dangerous to go too near these natural batteries during\r\nthe shooting season. A blow in the eye from one would blind a man\r\ninstantly. I well remember the very first night I spent in my own house\r\nin Jamaica, where I went to live shortly after the repression of\r\n'Governor Eyre's rebellion,' as everybody calls it locally. All night\r\nlong I heard somebody, as I thought, practising with a revolver in my\r\nown back garden: a sound which somewhat alarmed me under those very\r\nunstable social conditions. An earthquake about midnight, it is true,\r\ndiverted my attention temporarily from the recurring shots, but didn't\r\nproduce the slightest effect upon the supposed rebel's devotion to the\r\nimprovement of his marksmanship. When morning dawned, however, I found\r\nit was only a sand-box tree, and that the shots were nothing more than\r\nthe explosions of the capsules. As to the wonderful tales told about\r\nthe Brazilian cannon-ball tree, I cannot personally endorse them from\r\noriginal observation, and will not stain this veracious page with any\r\nsecond-hand quotations from the strange stories of modern scientific\r\nMunchausens.\r\n\r\nStill higher in the evolutionary scale than the elastic fruits are\r\nthose airy species which have taken to themselves wings like the eagle,\r\nand soar forth upon the free breeze in search of what the Americans\r\ndescribe as 'fresh locations.' Of this class the simplest type may be\r\nseen in those forest-trees, like the maple and the sycamore, whose\r\nfruits are flattened out into long expansions or parachutes,\r\ntechnically known as 'keys,' by whose aid they flutter down obliquely\r\nto the ground at a considerable distance. The keys of the sycamore, to\r\ntake a single instance, when detached from the tree in autumn, fall\r\nspirally through the air owing to the twist of the winged arm, and are\r\ncarried so far that, as every gardener knows, young sycamore trees rank\r\namong the commonest weeds among our plots and flower-beds. A curious\r\nvariant upon this type is presented by the lime, or linden, whose\r\nfruits are in themselves small wingless nuts; but they are born in\r\nclusters upon a common stalk, which is winged on either side by a large\r\nmembranous bract. When the nuts are ripe, the whole cluster detaches\r\nitself in a body from the branch, and flutters away before the breeze\r\nby means of the common parachute, to some spot a hundred yards or more,\r\nwhere the wind chances to land it.\r\n\r\nThe topmost place of all in the hierarchy of seed life, it seems to me,\r\nis taken by the feathery fruits and seeds which float freely hither and\r\nthither wherever the wind may bear them. An immense number of the very\r\nhighest plants--the aristocrats of the vegetable kingdom, such as the\r\nlordly composites, those ultimate products of plant evolution--possess\r\nsuch floating feathery seeds; though here, again, the varieties of\r\ndetail are too infinite for rapid or popular classification. Indeed,\r\namong the composites alone--the thistle and dandelion tribe with downy\r\nfruits--I can reckon up more than a hundred and fifty distinct\r\nvariations of plan among the winged seeds known to me in various parts\r\nof Europe. But if I am strong, I am merciful: I will let the public off\r\nwith a hundred and forty-eight of them. My two exceptions shall be\r\nJohn-go-to-bed-at-noon and the hairy hawkweed, both of them common\r\nEnglish meadow-plants. The first, and more quaintly named, of the two\r\nhas little ribbed fruits that end in a long and narrow beak, supporting\r\na radial rib-work of spokes like the frame of an umbrella; and from rib\r\nto rib of this framework stretch feathery cross-pieces, continuous all\r\nround, so as to make of the whole mechanism a perfect circular\r\nparachute, resembling somewhat the web of a geometrical spider. But the\r\nhairy hawkweed is still more cunning in its generation; for that clever\r\nand cautious weed produces its seeds or fruits in clustered heads, of\r\nwhich the central ones are winged, while the outer are heavy, squat,\r\nand wingless. Thus does the plant make the best of all chances that may\r\nhappen to open before it: if one lot goes far and fares but ill, the\r\nother is pretty sure to score a bull's-eye.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few selected examples of the infinite dodges employed\r\nby enlightened herbs and shrubs to propagate their scions in foreign\r\nparts. Many more, equally interesting, must be left undescribed. Only\r\nfor a single case more can I still find room--that of the subterranean\r\nclover, which has been driven by its numerous enemies to take refuge at\r\nlast in a very remarkable and almost unique mode, of protecting its\r\noffspring. This particular kind of clover affects smooth and\r\nclose-cropped hillsides, where the sheep nibble down the grass and\r\nother herbage almost as fast as it springs up again. Now, clover seeds\r\nresemble their allies of the pea and bean tribe in being exceedingly\r\nrich in starch and other valuable foodstuffs. Hence, they are much\r\nsought after by the inquiring sheep, which eat them off wherever found,\r\nas exceptionally nutritious and dainty morsels. Under these\r\ncircumstances, the subterranean clover has learnt to produce small\r\nheads of bloom, pressed close to the ground, in which only the outer\r\nflowers are perfect and fertile, while the inner ones are transformed\r\ninto tiny wriggling corkscrews. As soon as the fertile flowers have\r\nbegun to set their seed, by the kind aid of the bees, the whole stem\r\nbends downward, automatically, of its own accord; the little corkscrews\r\nthen worm their way into the turf beneath; and the pods ripen and\r\nmature in the actual soil itself, where no prying ewe can poke an\r\ninquisitive nose to grub them up and devour them. Cases like this point\r\nin certain ways to the absolute high-water-mark of vegetable ingenuity:\r\nthey go nearest of all in the plant-world to the similitude of\r\nconscious animal intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A DESERT FRUIT.\r\n\r\nWho knows the Mediterranean, knows the prickly pear. Not that that\r\nquaint and uncanny-looking cactus, with its yellow blossoms and\r\nbristling fruits that seem to grow paradoxically out of the edge of\r\nthick fleshy leaves, is really a native of Italy, Spain, and North\r\nAfrica, where it now abounds on every sun-smitten hillside. Like Mr.\r\nHenry James and Mr. Marion Crawford, the Barbary fig, as the French\r\ncall it, is, in point of fact, an American citizen, domiciled and half\r\nnaturalised on this side of the Atlantic, but redolent still at heart\r\nof its Columbian origin. Nothing is more common, indeed, than to see\r\nclassical pictures of the Alma-Tadema school--not, of course, from the\r\nbrush of the master himself, who is impeccable in such details, but\r\nfair works of decent imitators--in which Caia or Marcia leans\r\ngracefully in her white stole on one pensive elbow against a marble\r\nlintel, beside a courtyard decorated with a Pompeian basin, and\r\novergrown with prickly pear or \"American aloes.\" I need hardly say\r\nthat, as a matter of plain historical fact, neither cactuses nor agaves\r\nwere known in Europe till long after Christopher Columbus had steered\r\nhis wandering bark to the sandy shores of Cat's Island in the Bahamas.\r\n(I have seen Cat's Island with these very eyes, and can honestly assure\r\nyou that its shores _are_ sandy.) But this is only one among the many\r\npardonable little inaccuracies of painters, who thrust scarlet\r\ngeraniums from the Cape of Good Hope into the fingers of Aspasia, or\r\nsupply King Solomon in all his glory with Japanese lilies of the most\r\nrecent introduction.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, it is true, both the prickly-pear cactus and the\r\nAmerican agave (which the world at large insists upon confounding with\r\nthe aloe, a member of a totally distinct family) have spread themselves\r\nin an apparently wild condition over all the rocky coasts both of\r\nSouthern Europe and of Northern Africa. The alien desert weeds have\r\nfixed their roots firmly in the sunbaked clefts of Ligurian Apennines;\r\nthe tall candelabrum of the western agave has reared its great spike of\r\nbranching blossoms (which flower, not once in a century, as legend\r\navers, but once in some fifteen years or so) on all the basking\r\nhillsides of the Mauritanian Atlas. But for the origin, and therefore\r\nfor the evolutionary history, of either plant, we must look away from\r\nthe shore of the inland sea to the arid expanse of the Mexican desert.\r\nIt was there, among the sweltering rocks of the Tierras Calientes, that\r\nthese ungainly cactuses first learned to clothe themselves in prickly\r\nmail, to store in their loose tissues an abundant supply of sticky\r\nmoisture, and to set at defiance the persistent attacks of all external\r\nenemies. The prickly pear, in fact, is a typical instance of a desert\r\nplant, as the camel is a typical instance of a desert animal. Each lays\r\nitself out to endure the long droughts of its almost rainless habitat\r\nby drinking as much as it can when opportunity offers, hoarding up the\r\nsuperfluous water for future use, and economising evaporation by every\r\nmeans in its power.\r\n\r\nIf you ask that convenient fiction, the Man in the Street, what sort of\r\nplant a cactus is, he will probably tell you it is all leaf and no\r\nstem, and each of the leaves grows out of the last one. Whenever we set\r\nup the Man in the Street, however, you must have noticed we do it in\r\norder to knock him down again like a nine-pin next moment: and this\r\nparticular instance is no exception to the rule; for the truth is that\r\na cactus is practically all stem and no leaves, what looks like a leaf\r\nbeing really a branch sticking out at an angle. The true leaves, if\r\nthere are any, are reduced to mere spines or prickles on the surface,\r\nwhile the branches, in the prickly-pear and many of the ornamental\r\nhot-house cactuses, are flattened out like a leaf to perform foliar\r\nfunctions. In most plants, to put it simply, the leaves are the mouths\r\nand stomachs of the organism; their thin and flattened blades are\r\nspread out horizontally in a wide expanse, covered with tiny throats\r\nand lips which suck in carbonic acid from the surrounding air, and\r\ndisintegrate it in their own cells under the influence of sunlight. In\r\nthe prickly pears, on the contrary, it is the flattened stem and\r\nbranches which undertake this essential operation in the life of the\r\nplant--the sucking-in of carbon and giving-out of oxygen, which is to\r\nthe vegetable exactly what the eating and digesting of food is to the\r\nanimal organism. In their old age, however, the stems of the prickly\r\npear display their true character by becoming woody in texture and\r\nlosing their articulated leaf-like appearance.\r\n\r\nEverything on this earth can best be understood by investigating the\r\nhistory of its origin and development, and in order to understand this\r\ncurious reversal of the ordinary rule in the cactus tribe we must look\r\nat the circumstances under which the race was evolved in the howling\r\nwaste of American deserts. (All deserts have a prescriptive right to\r\nhowl, and I wouldn't for worlds deprive them of the privilege.) Some\r\nfamiliar analogies will help us to see the utility of this arrangement.\r\nEverybody knows our common English stone-crops--or if he doesn't he\r\nought to, for they are pretty and ubiquitous. Now stone-crops grow for\r\nthe most part in chinks of the rock or thirsty sandy soil; they are\r\nessentially plants of very dry positions. Hence they have thick and\r\nsucculent little stems and leaves, which merge into one another by\r\nimperceptible gradations. All parts of the plant alike are stumpy,\r\ngreen, and cylindrical. If you squash them with your finger and thumb\r\nyou find that though the outer skin or epidermis is thick and firm, the\r\ninside is sticky, moist, and jelly-like. The reason for all this is\r\nplain; the stone-crops drink greedily by their roots whenever they get\r\na chance, and store up the water so obtained to keep them from\r\nwithering under the hot and pitiless sun that beats down upon them for\r\nhours in the baked clefts of their granite matrix. It's the camel trick\r\nover again. So leaves and stem grow thick and round and juicy within;\r\nbut outside they are enclosed in a stout layer of epidermis, which\r\nconsists of empty glassy cells, and which can be peeled off or flayed\r\nwith a knife like the skin of an animal. This outer layer prevents\r\nevaporation, and is a marked feature of all succulent plants which grow\r\nexposed to the sun on arid rocks or in sandy deserts.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to produce rounded stems and leaves, little\r\ndistinguishable from one another, is equally noticeable in many seaside\r\nplants which frequent the strip of thirsty sand beyond the reach of the\r\ntides. That belt of dry beach that stretches between high-water mark\r\nand the zone of vegetable mould, is to all intents and purpose a\r\nminiature desert. True, it is watered by rain from time to time; but\r\nthe drops sink in so fast that in half an hour, as we know, the entire\r\nstrip is as dry as Sahara again. Now there are many shore weeds of this\r\nintermediate sand-belt which mimic to a surprising degree the chief\r\nexternal features of the cactuses. One such weed, the common\r\nsalicornia, which grows in sandy bottoms or hollows of the beach, has a\r\njointed stem, branched and succulent, after the true cactus pattern,\r\nand entirely without leaves or their equivalents in any way. Still more\r\ncactus-like in general effect is another familiar English seaside weed,\r\nthe kali or glasswort, so called because it was formerly burnt to\r\nextract the soda. The glasswort has leaves, it is true, but they are\r\nthick and fleshy, continuous with the stem, and each one terminating in\r\na sharp, needle-like spine, which effectually protects the weed against\r\nall browsing aggressors.\r\n\r\nNow, wherever you get very dry and sandy conditions of soil, you get\r\nthis same type of cactus-like vegetation--_plantes grasses_, as the\r\nFrench well call them. The species which exhibit it are not necessary\r\nrelated to one another in any way; often they belong to most widely\r\ndistinct families; it is an adaptive resemblance alone, due to\r\nsimilarity of external circumstances only. The plants have to fight\r\nagainst the same difficulties, and they adopt for the most part the\r\nsame tactics to fight them with. In other words, any plant of whatever\r\nfamily, which wishes to thrive in desert conditions, must almost, as a\r\nmatter of course, become thick and succulent, so as to store up water,\r\nand must be protected by a stout epidermis to prevent its evaporation\r\nunder the fierce heat of the sunlight. They do not necessarily lose\r\ntheir leaves in the process; but the jointed stem usually answers the\r\npurpose of leaves under such conditions far better than any thin and\r\nexposed blade could do in the arid air of a baking desert. And\r\ntherefore, as a rule, desert plants are leafless.\r\n\r\nIn India, for example, there are no cactuses. But I wouldn't advise you\r\nto dispute the point with a peppery, fire-eating Anglo-Indian colonel.\r\nI did so once, myself, at the risk of my life, at a _table d'hôte_ on\r\nthe Continent; and the wonder is that I'm still alive to tell the\r\nstory. I had nothing but facts on my side, while the colonel had fists,\r\nand probably pistols. And when I say no cactuses, I mean, of course, no\r\nindigenous species; for prickly pears and epiphyllums may naturally be\r\nplanted by the hand of man anywhere. But what people take for thickets\r\nof cactus in the Indian jungle are really thickets of cactus-like\r\nspurges. In the dry soil of India, many spurges grow thick and\r\nsucculent, learn to suppress their leaves, and assume the bizarre forms\r\nand quaint jointed appearance of the true cactuses. In flower and\r\nfruit, however, they are euphorbias to the end; it is only in the thick\r\nand fleshy stem that they resemble their nobler and more beautiful\r\nWestern rivals. No true cactus grows truly wild anywhere on earth\r\nexcept in America. The family was developed there, and, till man\r\ntransplanted it, never succeeded in gaining a foothold elsewhere.\r\nEssentially tropical in type, it was provided with no means of\r\ndispersing its seeds across the enormous expanse of intervening ocean\r\nwhich separated its habitat from the sister continents.\r\n\r\nBut why are cactuses so almost universally prickly? From the grotesque\r\nlittle melon-cactuses of our English hothouses to the huge and ungainly\r\nmonsters which form miles of hedgerows on Jamaican hillsides, the\r\nmembers of this desert family are mostly distinguished by their\r\nabundant spines and thorns, or by the irritating hairs which break off\r\nin your skin if you happen to brush incautiously against them. Cactuses\r\nare the hedgehogs of the vegetable world; their motto is _Nemo me\r\nimpune lacessit_. Many a time in the West Indies I have pushed my hand\r\nfor a second into a bit of tangled 'bush,' as the negroes call it, to\r\nseize some rare flower or some beautiful insect, and been punished for\r\ntwenty-four hours afterwards by the stings of the almost invisible and\r\nglass-like little cactus-needles. When you rub them they only break in\r\npieces, and every piece inflicts a fresh wound on the flesh where it\r\nrankles. Some of the species have large, stout prickles; some have\r\nclusters of irritating hairs at measured distances; and some rejoice in\r\nboth means of defence at once, scattered impartially over their entire\r\nsurface. In the prickly pear, the bundles of prickles are arranged\r\ngeometrically with great regularity in a perfect quincunx. But that is\r\na small consolation indeed to the reflective mind when you've stung\r\nyourself badly with them.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this bellicose disposition on the part of the cactuses\r\nis a tolerably easy one to guess. Fodder is rare in the desert. The\r\nstarving herbivores that find themselves from time to time belated on\r\nthe confines of such thirsty regions would seize with avidity upon any\r\nsucculent plant which offered them food and drink at once in their last\r\nextremity. Fancy the joy with which a lost caravan, dying of hunger and\r\nthirst in the byways of Sahara, would hail a great bed of melons,\r\ncucumbers, and lettuces! Needless to say, however, under such\r\ncircumstances melon, cucumber, and lettuce would soon be exterminated:\r\nthey would be promptly eaten up at discretion without leaving a\r\ndescendant to represent them in the second generation. In the ceaseless\r\nwar between herbivore and plant, which is waged every day and all day\r\nlong the whole world over with far greater persistence than the war\r\nbetween carnivore and prey, only those species of plant can survive in\r\nsuch exposed situations which happen to develop spines, thorns, or\r\nprickles as a means of defence against the mouths of hungry and\r\ndesperate assailants.\r\n\r\nNor is this so difficult a bit of evolution as it looks at first sight.\r\nAlmost all plants are more or less covered with hairs, and it needs but\r\na slight thickening at the base, a slight woody deposit at the point,\r\nto turn them forthwith into the stout prickles of the rose or the\r\nbramble. Most leaves are more or less pointed at the end or at the\r\nsummits of the lobes; and it needs but a slight intensification of this\r\npointed tendency to produce forthwith the sharp defensive foliage of\r\ngorse, thistles, and holly. Often one can see all the intermediate\r\nstages still surviving under one's very eyes. The thistles, themselves,\r\nfor example, vary from soft and unarmed species which haunt\r\nout-of-the-way spots beyond the reach of browsing herbivores, to such\r\ntrebly-mailed types as that enemy of the agricultural interest, the\r\ncreeping thistle, in which the leaves continue themselves as prickly\r\nwings down every side of the stem, so that the whole plant is amply\r\nclad from head to foot in a defensive coat of fierce and bristling\r\nspearheads. There is a common little English meadow weed, the\r\nrest-harrow, which in rich and uncropped fields produces no defensive\r\narmour of any sort; but on the much-browsed-over suburban commons and\r\nin similar exposed spots, where only gorse and blackthorn stand a\r\nchance for their lives against the cows and donkeys, it has developed a\r\nprotected variety in which some of the branches grow abortive, and end\r\nabruptly in stout spines like a hawthorn's. Only those rest-harrows\r\nhave there survived in the sharp struggle for existence which happened\r\nmost to baffle their relentless pursuers.\r\n\r\nDesert plants naturally carry this tendency to its highest point of\r\ndevelopment. Nowhere else is the struggle for life so fierce; nowhere\r\nelse is the enemy so goaded by hunger and thirst to desperate measures.\r\nIt is a place for internecine warfare Hence, all desert plants are\r\nquite absurdly prickly. The starving herbivores will attack and devour\r\nunder such circumstances even thorny weeds, which tear or sting their\r\ntender tongues and palates, but which supply them at least with a\r\nlittle food and moisture: so the plants are compelled in turn to take\r\nalmost extravagant precautions. Sometimes the leaves end in a stout\r\ndagger-like point, as with the agave, or so-called American aloe;\r\nsometimes they are reduced to mere prickles or bundles of needle-like\r\nspikes; sometimes they are suppressed altogether, and the work of\r\ndefence is undertaken in their stead by irritating hairs intermixed\r\nwith caltrops of spines pointing outward from a common centre in every\r\ndirection. When one remembers how delicately sensitive are the tender\r\nnoses of most browsing herbivores, one can realize what an excellent\r\nmode of defence these irritating hairs must naturally constitute. I\r\nhave seen cows in Jamaica almost maddened by their stings, and even\r\nsavage bulls will think twice in their rage before they attempt to make\r\ntheir way through the serried spears of a dense cactus hedge. To put it\r\nbriefly, plants have survived under very arid or sandy conditions\r\nprecisely in proportion as they displayed this tendency towards the\r\nproduction of thorns, spines, bristles, and prickles.\r\n\r\nIt is a marked characteristic of the cactus tribe to be very tenacious\r\nof life, and when hacked to pieces, to spring afresh in full vigour\r\nfrom every scrap or fragment. True vegetable hydras, when you cut down\r\none, ten spring in its place: every separate morsel of the thick and\r\nsucculent stem has the power of growing anew into a separate cactus.\r\nSurprising as this peculiarity seems at first sight, it is only a\r\nspecial desert modification of a faculty possessed in a less degree by\r\nalmost all plants and by many animals. If you cut off the end of a rose\r\nbranch and stick it in the ground under suitable conditions, it grows\r\ninto a rose tree. If you take cuttings of scarlet geraniums or common\r\nverbenas, and pot them in moist soil, they bud out apace into new\r\nplants like their parents. Certain special types can even be propagated\r\nfrom fragments of the leaf; for example, there is a particularly\r\nvivacious begonia off which you may snap a corner of one blade, and\r\nhang it up by a string from a peg or the ceiling, when, hi, presto!\r\nlittle begonia plants begin to bud out incontinently on every side from\r\nits edges. A certain German professor went even further than that; he\r\nchopped up a liverwort very fine into vegetable mincemeat, which he\r\nthen spread thin over a saucerful of moist sand, and lo! in a few days\r\nthe whole surface of the mess was covered with a perfect forest of\r\nsprouting little liverworts. Roughly speaking, one may say that every\r\nfragment of every organism has in it the power to rebuild in its\r\nentirety another organism like the one of which it once formed a\r\ncomponent element.\r\n\r\nSimilarly with animals. Cut off a lizard's tail, and straightway a new\r\ntail grows in its place with surprising promptitude. Cut off a\r\nlobster's claw, and in a very few weeks that lobster is walking about\r\nairily on his native rocks, with two claws as usual. True, in these\r\ncases the tail and the claw don't bud out in turn into a new lizard or\r\na new lobster. But that is a penalty the higher organisms have to pay\r\nfor their extreme complexity. They have lost that plasticity, that\r\nfreedom of growth, which characterizes the simpler and more primitive\r\nforms of life; in their case the power of producing fresh organisms\r\nentire from a single fragment, once diffused equally over the whole\r\nbody, is now confined to certain specialized cells which, in their\r\ndeveloped form, we know as seeds or eggs. Yet, even among animals, at a\r\nlow stage of development, this original power of reproducing the whole\r\nfrom a single part remains inherent in the organism; for you may chop\r\nup a fresh-water hydra into a hundred little bits, and every bit will\r\nbe capable of growing afresh into a complete hydra.\r\n\r\nNow, desert plants would naturally retain this primitive tendency in a\r\nvery high degree; for they are specially organized to resist\r\ndrought--being the survivors of generations of drought-proof\r\nancestors--and, like the camel, they have often to struggle on through\r\nlong periods of time without a drop of water. Exactly the same thing\r\nhappens at home to many of our pretty little European stone-crops. I\r\nhave a rockery near my house overgrown with the little white sedum of\r\nour gardens. The birds often peck off a tiny leaf or branch; it drops\r\non the dry soil, and remains there for days without giving a sign of\r\nlife. But its thick epidermis effectually saves it from withering; and\r\nas soon as rain falls, wee white rootlets sprout out from the under\r\nside of the fragment as it lies, and it grows before long into a fresh\r\nsmall sedum plant. Thus, what seem like destructive agencies\r\nthemselves, are turned in the end by mere tenacity of life into a\r\nsecondary means of propagation.\r\n\r\nThat is why the prickly pear is so common in all countries where the\r\nclimate suits it, and where it has once managed to gain a foothold. The\r\nmore you cut it down, the thicker it springs; each murdered bit becomes\r\nthe parent in due time of a numerous offspring. Man, however, with his\r\nusual ingenuity, has managed to best the plant, on this its own ground,\r\nand turn it into a useful fodder for his beasts of burden. The prickly\r\npear is planted abundantly on bare rocks in Algeria, where nothing else\r\nwould grow, and is cut down when adult, divested of its thorns by a\r\nrough process of hacking, and used as food for camels and cattle. It\r\nthus provides fresh moist fodder in the African summer when the grass\r\nis dried up and all other pasture crops have failed entirely.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the prickly pear, as of many other cactuses, grow\r\napparently on the edge of the leaves, which alone might give the\r\nobservant mind a hint as to the true nature of those thick and\r\nflattened expansions. For whenever what look like leaves bear flowers\r\nor fruit on their edge or midrib, as in the familiar instance of\r\nbutcher's broom, you may be sure at a glance they are really branches\r\nin disguise masquerading as foliage. The blossoms in the prickly pear\r\nare large, handsome, and yellow; at least, they would be handsome if\r\none could ever see them, but they are generally covered so thick in\r\ndust that it is difficult properly to appreciate their beauty. They\r\nhave a great many petals in numerous rows, and a great many stamens in\r\na rosette in the centre; and, to the best of my knowledge and belief,\r\nas lawyers put it, they are fertilized for the most part by tropical\r\nbutterflies; but on this point, having observed them but little in\r\ntheir native habitats, I speak under correction.\r\n\r\nThe fruit itself, to which the plant owes its popular name, is\r\nbotanically a berry, though a very big one, and it exhibits in a highly\r\nspecialized degree the general tactics of all its family. As far as\r\ntheir leaf-like stems go, the main object in life of the cactuses\r\nis--not to get eaten. But when it comes to the fruit, this object in\r\nlife is exactly reversed; the plant desires its fruit to be devoured by\r\nsome friendly bird or adapted animal, in order that the hard little\r\nseeds buried in the pulp within may be dispersed for germination under\r\nsuitable conditions. At the same time, true to its central idea, it\r\ncovers even the pear itself with deterrent and prickly hairs, meant to\r\nact as a defence against useless thieves or petty depredators, who\r\nwould eat the soft pulp on the plant as it stands (much as wasps do\r\npeaches) without benefiting the species in return by dispersing its\r\nseedlings. This practice is fully in accordance with the general habit\r\nof tropical or sub-tropical fruits, which lay themselves out to deserve\r\nthe kind offices of monkeys, parrots, toucans, hornbills, and other\r\nsuch large and powerful fruit-feeders. Fruits which arrange themselves\r\nfor a _clientèle_, of this character have usually thick or nauseous\r\nrinds, prickly husks, or other deterrent integuments; but they are full\r\nwithin of juicy pulp, embedding stony or nutlike seeds, which pass\r\nundigested through the gizzards of their swallowers.\r\n\r\nFor a similar reason, the actual prickly pears themselves are\r\nattractively coloured. I need hardly point out, I suppose, at the\r\npresent time of day, that such tints in the vegetable world act like\r\nthe gaudy posters of our London advertisers. Fruits and flowers which\r\ndesire to attract the attention of beasts, birds, or insects, are\r\ntricked out in flaunting hues of crimson, purple, blue, and yellow;\r\nfruits and flowers which could only be injured by the notice of animals\r\nare small and green, or dingy and inconspicuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PRETTY POLL.\r\n\r\nIt is an error of youth to despise parrots for their much talking.\r\nLoquacity isn't always a sign of empty-headedness, nor is silence a\r\nsure proof of weight and wisdom. Biologists, for their part, know\r\nbetter than that. By common consent, they rank the parrot group as the\r\nvery head and crown of bird creation. Not, of course, because pretty\r\nPoll can talk (in a state of nature, parrots only chatter somewhat\r\nmeaninglessly to one another), but because the group display on the\r\nwhole, all round, a greater amount of intelligence, of cleverness, and\r\nof adaptability to circumstances than any other birds, including even\r\ntheir cunning and secretive rivals, the ravens, the jackdaws, the\r\ncrows, and the magpies.\r\n\r\nWhat are the efficient causes of this exceptionally high intelligence\r\nin parrots? Well, Mr. Herbert Spencer, I believe, was the first to\r\npoint out the intimate connection that exists throughout the animal\r\nworld between mental development and the power of grasping an object\r\nall round so as to know exactly its shape and its tactile properties.\r\nThe possession of an effective prehensile organ--a hand or its\r\nequivalent--seems to be the first great requisite for the evolution of\r\na high order of intellect. Man and the monkeys, for example, have a\r\npair of hands; and in their case one can see at a glance how dependent\r\nis their intelligence upon these grasping organs. All human arts base\r\nthemselves ultimately upon the human hand; and even the apes approach\r\nnearest to humanity in virtue of their ever-active and busy little\r\nfingers. The elephant, again, has his flexible trunk, which, as we have\r\nall heard over and over again, _usque ad nauseam_, is equally well\r\nadapted to pick up a pin or to break the great boughs of tropical\r\nforest trees. (That pin, in particular, is now a well-worn classic.)\r\nThe squirrel, once more, celebrated for his unusual intelligence when\r\njudged by a rodent standard, uses his pretty little paws as veritable\r\nhands, by which he can grasp a nut or fruit all round, and so gain in\r\nhis small mind a clear conception of its true shape and properties.\r\nThroughout the animal kingdom generally, indeed, this correspondence,\r\nor rather this chain of causation, makes itself everywhere felt; no\r\nhigh intelligence without a highly developed prehensile and grasping\r\norgan.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the opossum is the very best and most crucial instance that\r\ncould possibly be adduced of the intimate connection which exists\r\nbetween touch and intellect. For the opossum is a marsupial; it belongs\r\nto the same group of lowly-organized, antiquated, and pouch-bearing\r\nanimals as the kangaroo, the wombat, and the other belated Australian\r\nmammals. Now everybody knows the marsupials as a class are nothing\r\nshort of preternaturally stupid. They are just about the very dullest\r\nand silliest of all existing quadrupeds. And this is reasonable enough,\r\nwhen one comes to think of it, for they represent a very antique and\r\nearly type, the first rough sketch of the mammalian idea, if I may so\r\ndescribe them, with wits unsharpened as yet by contact with the world\r\nin the fierce competition of the struggle for life as it displays\r\nitself on the crowded stage of the great continents. They stand, in\r\nshort, to the lions and tigers, the elephants and horses, the monkeys\r\nand squirrels, of Europe and America, as the Australian blackfellow\r\nstands to the Englishman or the Yankee. They are the last relic of the\r\noriginal secondary quadrupeds, stranded for ages in a remote southern\r\nisland, and still keeping up among Australian forests the antique type\r\nof life that went out of fashion in Europe, Asia, and America before\r\nthe chalk was laid down or the London Clay deposited on the bed of our\r\nnorthern oceans. Hence they have still very narrow brains, and are so\r\nextremely stupid that a kangaroo, it is said--though I don't vouch for\r\nit myself--when struck a smart blow, will turn and bite the stick that\r\nhurts him instead of expending his anger on the hand that holds it.\r\n\r\nNow, every Girton girl is well aware that the opossum, though it is a\r\nmarsupial too, differs inexpressibly in psychological development from\r\nthe kangaroo and the wombat. Your opossum, in short, is active, sly,\r\nand extremely intelligent. He knows his way about the world he lives\r\nin. 'A 'possum up a gum-tree' is accepted by the observant American\r\nmind as the very incarnation of animal cleverness, cunning, and\r\nduplicity. In negro folk-lore the resourceful 'possum takes the place\r\nof Reynard the Fox in European stories: he is the Macchiavelli of wild\r\nbeasts: there is no ruse on earth of which he isn't amply capable, no\r\nartful trick which he can't design and execute, no wily manoeuvre which\r\nhe can't contrive and carry to an end successfully. All guile and\r\nintrigue, the 'possum can circumvent even Uncle Remus himself by his\r\ncrafty diplomacy. And what is it that makes all the difference between\r\nthis 'cute Yankee marsupial and his backward and belated Australian\r\ncousins? Why, nothing but the possession of a prehensile hand and tail.\r\nTherein lies the whole secret. The opossum's hind foot has a genuine\r\nopposable thumb; and he also uses his tail in climbing as a\r\nsupernumerary hand, almost as much as do any of the monkeys. He often\r\nsuspends himself by it, like an acrobat, swings his body to and fro to\r\nget up steam, then lets go suddenly, and flies away to a distant\r\nbranch, which he clutches by means of his hand-like hind feet. If the\r\ntoes play him false, he can 'recover his tip,' as circus-folk put it,\r\nwith his prehensile tail. The consequence is that the opossum, being\r\nable to form for himself clear and accurate conceptions of the real\r\nshapes and relations of things by these two distinct grasping organs,\r\nhas acquired an unusual amount of general intelligence. And further, in\r\nthe keen competition of the American continent, he has been forced to\r\ndevelop an amount of cleverness and low cunning which leaves his\r\nAustralian poor relations far behind in the Middle Ages of evolution.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of seeming to run off at a tangent and forsake our\r\nostensible subject, pretty Poll, altogether, I must just pause for one\r\nmoment more to answer an objection which I know has been trembling on\r\nthe tip of your tongue any time the last five minutes. You've been\r\nwaiting till you could get a word in edgeways to give me a friendly\r\nnudge and remark very wisely, 'But look here, I say; how about the dog\r\nand the horse in your argument? _They've_ got no prehensile organ that\r\never I heard of, and yet they're universally allowed to be the\r\ncleverest and most intelligent of all earthly quadrupeds.' True, O most\r\nsapient and courteous objector. I grant it you at once. But observe the\r\ndifference. The cleverness of the horse and the dog is acquired, not\r\noriginal. It has probably arisen in the course of their long hereditary\r\nintercourse and companionship with man, the cleverest and most\r\nserviceable individuals being deliberately selected from generation to\r\ngeneration, as dams and sires to breed from. We can't fairly compare\r\nthese artificial human products, therefore, with wild races whose\r\nintelligence is all native and self-evolved. Moreover, the horse at\r\nleast _has_ to some slight extent a prehensile organ in his very mobile\r\nand sensitive lip, which he uses like an undeveloped or rudimentary\r\nproboscis to feel things all over with. So that the dog alone remains\r\nas a contradictory instance; and even the dog derives his cleverness\r\nindirectly from man, whose hand and thumb in the last resort are really\r\nat the bottom of his vicarious wisdom.\r\n\r\nWe may conclude, then, I believe, that touch, as Mr. Herbert Spencer\r\nadmirably words it, is 'the mother-tongue of the senses;' and that in\r\nproportion as animals have or have not highly developed and serviceable\r\ntactile organs will they rank high or low in the intellectual hierarchy\r\nof nature. Now, how does this bear upon the family of parrots? Well, in\r\nthe first place, everybody who has ever kept a cockatoo or a macaw in\r\ndomestic slavery is well aware that in no other birds do the claws so\r\nclosely resemble a human or simian hand, not indeed in outer form or\r\nappearance, but in opposability of the thumbs and in perfection of\r\ngrasping power. The toes on each foot are arranged in opposite\r\npairs--two turning in front and two backward, which gives all parrots\r\ntheir peculiar firmness in clinging on a perch or on the branch of a\r\ntree with one foot only, while they extend the other to grasp a fruit\r\nor to clutch at any object they desire to take possession of. True,\r\nthis peculiarity isn't entirely confined to the parrots alone, as such.\r\nThey share the division of the foot into two thumbs and two fingers\r\nwith a whole large group of allied birds, called, in the charmingly\r\nconcise and poetical language of technical ornithology, the Scansorial\r\nPicarians, and more generally, known to the unlearned herd (meaning you\r\nand me) by their several names of woodpeckers, cuckoos, toucans, and\r\nplantain-eaters. All the members of this great group, of which the\r\nparrots proper are only the most advanced and developed family, possess\r\nthe same arrangement of the digits into front-toes and back-toes. But\r\nin none is the arrangement so perfect as in the parrots, and in none is\r\nthe power of grasping an object all round so completely developed and\r\nso pregnant in moral and intellectual consequences.\r\n\r\nAll the Scansorial Picarians, however (if the reader with his\r\nproverbial courtesy will kindly pardon me the inevitable use of such\r\nvery bad words), are essentially tree-haunters; and the tree-haunting\r\nand climbing habit, as is well beknown, seems particularly favourable\r\nto the growth of intelligence. Thus schoolboys climb trees--but I\r\nforgot: this is a scientific article, and such levity is inconsistent\r\nwith the dignity of science. Let us be serious! Well, at any rate,\r\nmonkeys, squirrels, opossums, wild cats, are all of them climbers, and\r\nall of them, in the act of clinging, jumping, and balancing themselves\r\non boughs, gain such an accurate idea of geometrical figure,\r\nperspective, distance, and the true nature of space-relations, as could\r\nhardly be acquired in any other manner. In one word, they thoroughly\r\nunderstand space of three dimensions, and the tactual realities that\r\nanswer to and underlie each visible appearance. This is the very\r\nsubstratum of all intelligence; and the monkeys, possessing it more\r\nprofoundly than any other animals, have accordingly taken the top of\r\nthe form in the competitive examination perpetually conducted by\r\nsurvival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nSo, too, among birds, the parrots and their allies climb trees and\r\nrocks with exceptional ease and agility. Even in their own department\r\nthey are the great feathered acrobats. Anybody who watches a\r\nwoodpecker, for example, grasping the bark of a tree with its crooked\r\nand powerful toes, while it steadies itself behind by digging its stiff\r\ntail-feathers into the crannies of the outer rind, will readily\r\nunderstand how clear a notion the bird must gain into the practical\r\naction of the laws of gravity. But the true parrots go a step further\r\nin the same direction than the woodpeckers or the toucans; for, in\r\naddition to prehensile feet, they have also a highly-developed\r\nprehensile bill, and within it a tongue which acts in reality as an\r\norgan of touch. They use their crooked beaks to help them in climbing\r\nfrom branch to branch; and being thus provided alike with wings, legs,\r\nhands, fingers, bill and tongue, they are in fact the most truly\r\narboreal of all known animals, and present in the fullest and highest\r\ndegree all the peculiar features of the tree-haunting existence.\r\n\r\nNor is that all. Alone among birds or mammals, the parrots have the\r\ncurious peculiarity of being able to move the upper as well as the\r\nlower jaw. It is this strange mobility of both the mandibles together,\r\ncombined with the crafty effect of the sideways glance from those\r\nartful eyes, that gives the characteristic air of intelligence and\r\nwisdom to the parrot's face. We naturally expect so clever a bird to\r\nspeak. And when it turns upon us suddenly with a copy-book maxim, we\r\nare in no way astonished at its surpassing smartness.\r\n\r\nParrots are vegetarians; with a single degraded exception to whom I\r\nshall recur hereafter, Sir Henry Thompson himself couldn't find fault\r\nwith their regimen. They live chiefly upon a light but nutritious diet\r\nof fruit and seeds, or upon the abundant nectar of rich tropical\r\nflowers. And it is mainly for the sake of getting at their chosen food\r\nthat they have developed the large and powerful bills which\r\ncharacterise the family. You may have perhaps noted that most tropical\r\nfruit-eaters, like the hornbills and the toucans, are remarkable for\r\nthe size and strength of their beaks: if you haven't, I dare say you\r\nwill generously take my word for it. And, _per contra_, it may also\r\nhave struck you that most tropical fruits have thick or hard or\r\nnauseous rinds, which need to be torn off before the monkeys or birds\r\nfor whose use they are intended, can get at them and eat them. Our\r\nlittle northern strawberries, and raspberries, and currants, and\r\nwhortleberries, developed with a single eye to the petty robins and\r\nfinches of temperate climates, can be popped into, the mouth whole and\r\neaten as they stand: they are meant for small birds to devour, and to\r\ndisperse the tiny undigested nut-like seeds in return for the bribe of\r\nthe soft pulp that surrounds them. But it is quite otherwise with\r\noranges, shaddocks, bananas, plantains, mangoes, and pine-apples: those\r\ngreat tropical fruits can only be eaten properly with a knife and fork,\r\nafter stripping off the hard and often acrid rind that guards and\r\npreserves them. They lay themselves out for dispersion by monkeys,\r\ntoucans, and other relatively large and powerful fruit-eaters; and the\r\nrind is put there as a barrier against small thieves who would rob the\r\nsweet pulp, but be absolutely incapable of carrying away and dispersing\r\nthe large and richly-stored seeds it covers.\r\n\r\nParrots and toucans, however, have no knives and forks to cut off the\r\nrind with; but as monkeys use their fingers, so the birds use for the\r\nsame purpose their sharp and powerful bills. No better nut-crackers and\r\nfruit-parers could possibly be found. The parrot, in particular, has\r\ndeveloped for the purpose his curved and inflated beak--a wonderful\r\nweapon, keen as a tailor's scissors, and moved by powerful muscles on\r\neither side of the face which bring together the cutting edges with\r\nextraordinary energy. The way the bird holds the fruit gingerly in one\r\nclaw, while he strips off the rind dexterously with his under-hung\r\nlower mandible, and keeps a sharp look-out meanwhile on either side\r\nwith those sly and stealthy eyes of his for a possible intruder,\r\nsuggests to the observing mind the whole living drama of his native\r\nforest. One sees in that vivid world the watchful monkey ever ready to\r\nswoop down upon the tempting tail-feathers of his hereditary foe: one\r\nsees the canny parrot ever prepared for his rapid attack, and ever\r\neager to make him pay with five joints of his tail for his impertinent\r\ninterference with an unoffending fellow-citizen of the arboreal\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nStill, there are parrots and parrots, of course. Not all this vast\r\nfamily are in all things of like passions one with another. The great\r\nblack cockatoo, for example, the largest of the tribe, lives almost\r\nentirely off the central shoot or 'cabbage' of palm-trees: an expensive\r\nkind of food, for when once the 'cabbage' is eaten the tree dies\r\nforthwith, so that each black cockatoo must have killed in his time\r\nwhole groves of cabbage-palms. Others, again, feed off fruits and\r\nseeds; and not a few are entirely adapted for flower-haunting and\r\nhoney-sucking.\r\n\r\nAs a group, the parrots are comparatively modern birds. Indeed, they\r\ncould have no place in the world till the big tropical fruits and nuts\r\nwere beginning to be developed. And it is now pretty certain that\r\nfruits and nuts are for the most part of very recent and special\r\nevolution. To put it briefly, the monkeys and parrots developed the\r\nfruits and nuts, while the fruits and nuts returned the compliment by\r\ndeveloping conversely the monkeys and parrots. In other words, both\r\ntypes grew up side by side in mutual dependence, and evolved themselves\r\n_pari passu_ for one another's benefit. Without the fruits there could\r\nbe no fruit-eaters; and without the fruit-eaters to disperse their\r\nseeds, there could just to the same extent be no fruits to speak of.\r\n\r\nMost of the parrots very much resemble the monkeys and other tropical\r\nfruit-feeders in their habits and manners. They are gregarious,\r\nmischievous, noisy, and irresponsible. They have no moral sense, and\r\nare fond of practical jokes and other schoolboy horseplay. They move\r\nabout in flocks, screeching aloud as they go, and alight together on\r\nsome tree well covered with berries. No doubt, they herd together for\r\nthe sake of protection and screech both to keep the flock in a body and\r\nto strike alarm and consternation into the breasts of their enemies.\r\nWhen danger threatens, the first bird that perceives it sounds a note\r\nof warning; and in a moment the whole troop is on the wing at once,\r\nvociferous and eager, roaring forth a song in their own tongue which\r\nmay be roughly interpreted as stating in English that they don't want\r\nto fight, but by Jingo, if they do, they'll tear their enemy to shreds\r\nand drink his blood up too.\r\n\r\nThe common grey parrot, the best known in confinement of all his kind,\r\nand unrivalled as an orator for his graces of speech, is a native of\r\nWest Africa; so that he shares with other West Africans that perfect\r\ncommand of language which has always been a marked characteristic of\r\nthe negro race. He feeds in a general way upon palm-nuts, bananas,\r\nmangoes, and guavas, but he is by no means averse, if opportunity\r\noffers, to the Indian corn of the industrious native. His wife\r\naccompanies him in his solitary rambles, for they are not gregarious.\r\nIn her native haunts, indeed, Polly is an unsociable bird. It is only\r\nin confinement that her finer qualities come out, and that she develops\r\ninto a speech-maker of distinguished attainments.\r\n\r\nA very peculiar and exceptional offshoot of the parrot group is the\r\nbrush-tongued lory, several species of which are common in Australia,\r\nIndia, and the Molucca Islands. These pretty and interesting creatures\r\nare in point of fact parrots which have practically made themselves\r\ninto humming-birds by long continuance in the poetical habit of\r\nvisiting flowers for food. Like Mr. Oscar Wilde in his æsthetic days,\r\nthey breakfast off a lily. Flitting about from tree to tree with great\r\nrapidity, they thrust their long extensible tongues, pencilled with\r\nhoney-gathering hairs, into the tubes of many big tropical blossoms.\r\nThe lories, indeed, live entirely on nectar, and they are so common in\r\nthe region they have made their own that all the larger flowers there\r\nhave been developed with a special view to their tastes and habits, as\r\nwell as to the structure of their peculiar brush-like honey-collector.\r\nIn most parrots the mouth is dry and the tongue horny; but in the\r\nlories it is moist and much more like the same organ in the\r\nhumming-birds and sun-birds. The prevalence of very large and\r\nbrilliantly coloured flowers in the Malayan region must be set down for\r\nthe most part to the selective action of these æsthetic and\r\ncolour-loving little brush-tongued parrots.\r\n\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, as everybody knows, are the countries where\r\neverything goes by contraries. And it is here that the parrot group has\r\ndeveloped some of its strangest and most abnormal offshoots. One would\r\nimagine beforehand that no two birds could be more unlike in every\r\nrespect than the gaudy, noisy, gregarious cockatoos and the sombre,\r\nnocturnal, solitary owls. Yet the New Zealand owl-parrot is, to put it\r\nplainly, a lory which has assumed all the outer appearance and habits\r\nof an owl. A lurker in the twilight or under the shades of night,\r\nburrowing for its nest in holes in the ground, it has dingy brown\r\nplumage like the owls, with an undertone of green to bespeak its parrot\r\norigin: while its face is entirely made up of two great disks,\r\nsurrounding the eyes, which succeed in giving it a most marked and\r\nunmistakable owl-like appearance.\r\n\r\nNow, why should a parrot so strangely disguise itself and belie its\r\nancestry? The reason is plain. It found a place for it ready made in\r\nnature. New Zealand is a remote and sparsely-stocked island, peopled by\r\nmere casual waifs and strays of life from adjacent but still very\r\ndistant continents. There are no dangerous enemies there. Here, then,\r\nwas a clear chance for a nightly prowler. The owl-parrot with true\r\nbusiness instinct saw the opening thus clearly laid before it, and took\r\nto a nocturnal and burrowing life, with the natural consequence that it\r\nacquired in time the dingy plumage, crepuscular eyes, and broad\r\ndisk-like reflectors of other prowling night-fliers. Unlike the owls,\r\nhowever, the owl-parrot, true to the vegetarian instincts of the whole\r\nlory race, lives almost entirely upon sprigs of mosses and other\r\ncreeping plants. It is thus essentially a ground bird; and as it feeds\r\nat night in a country possessing no native beasts of prey, it has\r\nalmost lost the power of flight, and uses its wings only as a sort of\r\nparachute to break its fall in descending from a rock or tree to its\r\naccustomed feeding-ground. To get up again, it climbs, parrot-like,\r\nwith its hooked claws, up the surface of the trunk or the face of a\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nEven more aberrant in its ways, however, than the burrowing owl-parrot,\r\nis that other strange and hated New Zealand lory, the kea, which, alone\r\namong its kind, has abjured the gentle ancestral vegetarianism of the\r\ncockatoos and macaws, in favour of a carnivorous diet of singular\r\nferocity. And what is odder still, this evil habit has been developed\r\nin the kea since the colonization of New Zealand by the English, those\r\nmost demoralizing of new-comers. The settlers have taught the Maori to\r\nwear tall hats and to drink strong liquors: and they have thrown\r\ntemptation in the way of even the once innocent native parrot. Before\r\nthe white man came, in fact, the kea was a mild-mannered fruit-eating\r\nor honey-sucking bird. But as soon as sheep-stations were established\r\nin the island these degenerate parrots began to acquire a distinct\r\ntaste for raw mutton. At first, to be sure, they ate only the sheep's\r\nheads and offal that were thrown out from the slaughter-houses picking\r\nthe bones as clean of meat as a dog or a jackal. But in process of\r\ntime, as the taste for blood grew upon them, a still viler idea entered\r\ninto their wicked heads. The first step on the downward path suggested\r\nthe second. If dead sheep are good to eat, why not also living ones?\r\nThe kea, pondering deeply on this abstruse problem, solved it at once\r\nwith an emphatic affirmative. And he straightway proceeded to act upon\r\nhis convictions, and invent a really hideous mode of procedure.\r\nPerching on the backs of the living sheep he has now learnt the exact\r\nspot where the kidneys are to be found; and he tears open the flesh to\r\nget at these dainty morsels, which he pulls out and devours, leaving\r\nthe unhappy animal to die in miserable agony. As many as two hundred\r\newes have thus been killed in a night at a single station. I need\r\nhardly add that the sheep-farmer naturally resents this irregular\r\nproceeding, so opposed to all ideals of good grazing, and that the days\r\nof the kea are now numbered in New Zealand. But from the purely\r\npsychological point of view the case is an interesting one, as being\r\nthe best recorded instance of the growth of a new and complex instinct\r\nactually under the eyes of human observers.\r\n\r\nOne word as to the general colouring of the parrot group as a whole.\r\nTropical forestine birds have usually a ground tone of green because\r\nthat colour enables them best to escape notice among the monotonous\r\nverdure of equatorial woodland scenery. In the north, to be sure, green\r\nis a very conspicuous colour; but that is only because for half the\r\nyear our trees are bare, and even during the other half they lack that\r\n'breadth of tropic shade' which characterises the forests of all hot\r\ncountries. Therefore, in temperate climates, the common ground-tone of\r\nbirds is brown, to harmonise with the bare boughs and leafless twigs,\r\nthe clods of earth and dead turf or stubble. But in the evergreen\r\ntropics green is the right hue for concealment or defence. Therefore\r\nthe parrots, the most purely tropical family of birds on earth, are\r\nmostly greenish; and among the smaller and more defenceless sorts, like\r\nthe familiar little love-birds, where the need for protection is\r\ngreatest, the green of the plumage is almost unbroken. Of the tiny\r\nPigmy Parrots of New Guinea, for instance, Mr. Bowdler Sharpe says:\r\n'Owing to their small size and the resemblance of their green colouring\r\nto the forests they inhabit, they are not easily seen, and until recent\r\nyears were very hard to procure.' And of the green parrot of Jamaica,\r\nMr. Gosse remarks: 'Often we hear their voices proceeding from a\r\ncertain tree, or else have marked the descent of a flock on it; but on\r\nproceeding to the spot, though the eye has not wandered from it, we\r\ncannot discover an individual. We go close to the tree, but all is\r\nsilent and still as death. We institute a careful survey of every part\r\nwith the eye, to detect the slightest motion, or the form of a bird\r\namong the leaves, but all in vain. We begin to think they have stolen\r\noff unperceived; but on throwing a stone into the tree, a dozen throats\r\nburst forth into a cry, and as many green birds rush forth upon the\r\nwing. Green may thus be regarded as the normal or basal parrot tint,\r\nfrom which all other colours are special decorative variations.\r\n\r\nBut fruit-eating and flower-feeding creatures, like butterflies and\r\nhumming-birds--seeking their food ever among the bright berries and\r\nbrilliant flowers, almost invariably acquire in the long run an\r\næsthetic taste for pure and varied colouring, and by the aid of sexual\r\nselection this taste stereotypes itself at last in their own wings and\r\nplumage. They choose their mates for colour as they choose their\r\nfoodstuffs. Hence all the larger and more gregarious parrots, in which\r\nthe need for concealment is less, tend to diversify the fundamental\r\ngreen of their coats with crimson, yellow, or blue, which in some cases\r\ntake possession of the entire body. The largest kinds of all, like the\r\ngreat blue and yellow or crimson macaws, are as gorgeous as Solomon in\r\nall his glory: and they are also the species least afraid of enemies;\r\nfor in Brazil you may often see them wending their way homeward openly\r\nin pairs every evening, with as little attempt at concealment as rooks\r\nin England. In the Moluccas and New Guinea, says Mr. Wallace, white\r\ncockatoos and gorgeous lories in crimson and blue are the very\r\ncommonest objects in the local fauna. Even the New Zealand owl-parrot,\r\nhowever, still retains many traces of his original greenness, mixed\r\nwith the dirty brown and dingy yellow of his acquired nocturnal and\r\nburrowing nature.\r\n\r\nIf fruit-eaters are fine, flower-haunters are magnificent. And the\r\nbrush-tongued lories, that search for nectar among the bells of Malayan\r\nblossoms, are the brightest-coloured of all the parrot tribes. Indeed,\r\nno group of birds, according to Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace (who ought to\r\nknow, if anybody does), exhibits within the same limited number of\r\ntypes so extraordinary a diversity and richness of colouring as the\r\nparrots. 'As a rule,' he says, 'parrots may be termed green birds, the\r\nmajority of the species having this colour as the basis of their\r\nplumage, relieved by caps, gorgets, bands and wing-spots of other and\r\nbrighter hues. Yet this general green tint sometimes changes into light\r\nor deep blue, as in some macaws; into pure yellow or rich orange, as in\r\nsome of the American macaw-parrots; into purple, grey or dove-colour,\r\nas in some American, African, and Indian species; into the purest\r\ncrimson, as in some of the lories; into rosy-white and pure white, as\r\nin the cockatoos; and into a deep purple, ashy or black, as in several\r\nPapuan, Australian, and Mascarene species. There is in fact hardly a\r\nsingle distinct and definable colour that cannot be fairly matched\r\namong the 390 species of known parrots. Their habits, too, are such as\r\nto bring them prominently before the eye. They usually feed in flocks;\r\nthey are noisy, and so attract attention; they love gardens, orchards,\r\nand open sunny places; they wander about far in search of food, and\r\ntowards sunset return homeward in noisy flocks, or in constant pairs.\r\nTheir forms and motions are often beautiful and attractive. The\r\nimmensely long tails of the macaws and the more slender tails of the\r\nIndian parroquets, the fine crest of the cockatoos, the swift flight of\r\nmany of the smaller species, and the graceful motions of the little\r\nlove-birds and allied forms, together with their affectionate natures,\r\naptitude for domestication, and power of mimicry, combine to render\r\nthem at once the most conspicuous and the most attractive of all the\r\nspecially tropical forms of bird life.'\r\n\r\nI have purposely left to the last the one point about parrots which\r\nmost often attracts the attention of the young, the gay, the giddy, and\r\nthe thoughtless: I mean their power of mimicry in human language. And I\r\nbelieve I am justified in passing it over lightly. For in fact this\r\npower is but a very incidental result of the general intelligence of\r\nparrots, combined with the other peculiarities of their social life and\r\nforestine character. Dominant woodland animals, indeed, like monkeys,\r\nparrots, toucans, and hornbills, at least if vegetarian in their\r\nhabits, are almost always gregarious, noisy, mischievous, and\r\nimitative. And the imitation results directly from the unusual\r\nintelligence; for, after all, what is the power of learning itself--at\r\nleast, in all save its very highest phases--but the faculty of\r\naccurately imitating another? Monkeys for the most part imitate action\r\nonly, because they haven't very varied or flexible voices. Parrots and\r\nmany other birds, on the contrary--like the starling and still more\r\nmarkedly the American mocking-bird--being endowed with considerable\r\nflexibility of voice, imitate either songs or spoken words with great\r\ndistinctness. In the parrot the power of attention is also very\r\nconsiderable, for the bird will often try over with itself repeatedly\r\nthe lesson it has set itself to learn. But people too generally forget\r\nthat at best the parrot knows only the general application of a\r\nsentence, not the separate meanings of its component words. It knows,\r\nfor example, that 'Polly wants a lump of sugar' is a phrase often\r\nfollowed by a present of food. But to believe it can understand an\r\nabstract expression, like the famous 'By Jove! what a beastly lot of\r\nparrots!' is to confound learning by rote with genuine comprehension. A\r\ncareful review of all the evidence makes almost every scientific\r\nobserver conclude that at most a parrot knows a word of command as a\r\nhorse knows 'Whoa!' or a dog knows the order to hunt for rats in the\r\nwainscot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HIGH LIFE.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows mountain flowers are beautiful. As one rises up any\r\nminor height in the Alps or the Pyrenees below snow-level, one notices\r\nat once the extraordinary brilliancy and richness of the blossoms one\r\nmeets there. All nature is dressed in its brightest robes. Great belts\r\nof blue gentian hang like a zone on the mountain slopes; masses of\r\nyellow globe-flower star the upland pastures; nodding heads of\r\nsoldanella lurk low among the rugged boulders by the glacier's side. No\r\nlowland blossoms have such vividness of colouring, or grow in such\r\nconspicuous patches. To strike the eye from afar, to attract and allure\r\nat a distance, is the great aim and end in life of the Alpine flora.\r\n\r\nNow, why are Alpine plants so anxious to be seen of men and angels? Why\r\ndo they flaunt their golden glories so openly before the world, instead\r\nof shrinking in modest reserve beneath their own green leaves, like the\r\nPuritan primrose and the retiring violet? The answer is, Because of the\r\nextreme rarity of the mountain air. It's the barometer that does it. At\r\nfirst sight, I will readily admit, this explanation seems as fanciful\r\nas the traditional connection between Goodwin Sands and Tenterden\r\nSteeple. But, like the amateur stories in country papers, it is\r\n'founded on fact,' for all that. (Imagine, by the way, a tale founded\r\nentirely on fiction! How charmingly aerial!) By a roundabout road,\r\nthrough varying chains of cause and effect, the rarity of the air does\r\nreally account in the long run for the beauty and conspicuousness of\r\nthe mountain flowers.\r\n\r\nFor bees, the common go-betweens of the loves of the plants, cease to\r\nrange about a thousand or fifteen hundred feet below snow-level. And\r\nwhy? Because it's too cold for them? Oh, dear, no: on sunny days in\r\nearly English spring, when the thermometer doesn't rise above freezing\r\nin the shade, you will see both the honey-bees and the great black\r\nbumble as busy as their conventional character demands of them among\r\nthe golden cups of the first timid crocuses. Give the bee sunshine,\r\nindeed, with a temperature just about freezing-point, and he'll flit\r\nabout joyously on his communistic errand. But bees, one must remember,\r\nhave heavy bodies and relatively small wings: in the rarefied air of\r\nmountain heights they can't manage to support themselves in the most\r\nliteral sense. Hence their place in these high stations of the world is\r\ntaken by the gay and airy butterflies, which have lighter bodies and a\r\nmuch bigger expanse of wing-area to buoy them up. In the valleys and\r\nplains the bee competes at an advantage with the butterflies for all\r\nthe sweets of life: but in this broad sub-glacial belt on the\r\nmountain-sides the butterflies in turn have things all their own way.\r\nThey flit about like monarchs of all they survey, without a rival in\r\nthe world to dispute their supremacy.\r\n\r\nAnd how does the preponderance of butterflies in the upper regions of\r\nthe air affect the colour and brilliancy of the flowers? Simply thus.\r\nBees, as we are all aware on the authority of the great Dr. Watts, are\r\nindustrious creatures which employ each shining hour (well-chosen\r\nepithet, 'shining') for the good of the community, and to the best\r\npurpose. The bee, in fact, is the _bon bourgeois_ of the insect world:\r\nhe attends strictly to business, loses no time in wild or reckless\r\nexcursions, and flies by the straightest path from flower to flower of\r\nthe same species with mathematical precision. Moreover, he is careful,\r\ncautious, observant, and steady-going--a model business man, in fact,\r\nof sound middle-class morals and sober middle-class intelligence. No\r\nflitting for him, no coquetting, no fickleness. Therefore, the flowers\r\nthat have adapted themselves to his needs, and that depend upon him\r\nmainly or solely for fertilisation, waste no unnecessary material on\r\nthose big flaunting coloured posters which we human observers know as\r\npetals. They have, for the most part, simple blue or purple flowers,\r\ntubular in shape and, individually, inconspicuous in hue; and they are\r\noftenest arranged in long spikes of blossom to avoid wasting the time\r\nof their winged Mr. Bultitudes. So long as they are just bright enough\r\nto catch the bee's eye a few yards away, they are certain to receive a\r\nvisit in due season from that industrious and persistent commercial\r\ntraveller. Having a circle of good customers upon whom they can depend\r\nwith certainty for fertilisation, they have no need to waste any large\r\nproportion of their substance upon expensive advertisements or gaudy\r\npetals.\r\n\r\nIt is just the opposite with butterflies. Those gay and irrepressible\r\ncreatures, the fashionable and frivolous element in the insect world,\r\ngad about from flower to flower over great distances at once, and think\r\nmuch more of sunning themselves and of attracting their fellows than of\r\nattention to business. And the reason is obvious, if one considers for\r\na moment the difference in the political and domestic economy of the\r\ntwo opposed groups. For the honey-bees are neuters, sexless purveyors\r\nof the hive, with no interest on earth save the storing of honey for\r\nthe common benefit of the phalanstery to which they belong. But the\r\nbutterflies are full-fledged males and females, on the hunt through the\r\nworld for suitable partners: they think far less of feeding than of\r\ndisplaying their charms: a little honey to support them during their\r\nflight is all they need:--'For the bee, a long round of ceaseless toil;\r\nfor me,' says the gay butterfly, 'a short life and a merry one.' Mr.\r\nHarold Skimpole needed only 'music, sunshine, a few grapes.' The\r\nbutterflies are of his kind. The high mountain zone is for them a true\r\nball-room: the flowers are light refreshments laid out in the\r\nvestibule. Their real business in life is not to gorge and lay by, but\r\nto coquette and display themselves and find fitting partners.\r\n\r\nSo while the bees with their honey-bags, like the financier with his\r\nmoney-bags, are storing up profit for the composite community, the\r\nbutterfly, on the contrary, lays himself out for an agreeable flutter,\r\nand sips nectar where he will, over large areas of country. He flies\r\nrather high, flaunting his wings in the sun, because he wants to show\r\nhimself off in all his airy beauty: and when he spies a bed of bright\r\nflowers afar off on the sun-smitten slopes, he sails off towards them\r\nlazily, like a grand signior who amuses himself. No regular plodding\r\nthrough a monotonous spike of plain little bells for him: what he wants\r\nis brilliant colour, bold advertisement, good honey, and plenty of it.\r\nHe doesn't care to search. Who wants his favours must make himself\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nNow, plants are good shopkeepers; they lay themselves out strictly to\r\nattract their customers. Hence the character of the flowers on this\r\nbeeless belt of mountain side is entirely determined by the character\r\nof the butterfly fertilisers. Only those plants which laid themselves\r\nout from time immemorial to suit the butterflies, in other words, have\r\nsucceeded in the long run in the struggle for existence. So the\r\nbutterfly-plants of the butterfly-zone are all strictly adapted to\r\nbutterfly tastes and butterfly fancies. They are, for the most part,\r\nindividually large and brilliantly coloured: they have lots of honey,\r\noften stored at the base of a deep and open bell which the long\r\nproboscis of the insect can easily penetrate: and they habitually grow\r\nclose together in broad belts or patches, so that the colour of each\r\nreinforces and aids the colour of the others. It is this cumulative\r\nhabit that accounts for the marked flowerbed or jam-tart character\r\nwhich everybody must have noticed in the high Alpine flora.\r\n\r\nAristocracies usually pride themselves on their antiquity: and the high\r\nlife of the mountains is undeniably ancient. The plants and animals of\r\nthe butterfly-zone belong to a special group which appears everywhere\r\nin Europe and America about the limit of snow, whether northward or\r\nupward. For example, I was pleased to note near the summit of Mount\r\nWashington (the highest peak in New Hampshire) that a large number of\r\nthe flowers belonged to species well known on the open plains of\r\nLapland and Finland. The plants of the High Alps are found also, as a\r\nrule, not only on the High Pyrenees, the Carpathians, the Scotch\r\nGrampians, and the Norwegian fjelds, but also round the Arctic Circle\r\nin Europe and America. They reappear at long distances where suitable\r\nconditions recur: they follow the snow-line as the snow-line recedes\r\never in summer higher north toward the pole or higher vertically toward\r\nthe mountain summits. And this bespeaks in one way to the reasoning\r\nmind a very ancient ancestry. It shows they date back to a very old and\r\ncold epoch.\r\n\r\nLet me give a single instance which strikingly illustrates the general\r\nprinciple. Near the top of Mount Washington, as aforesaid, lives to\r\nthis day a little colony of very cold-loving and mountainous\r\nbutterflies, which never descend below a couple of thousand feet from\r\nthe wind-swept summit. Except just there, there are no more of there\r\nsort anywhere about: and as far as the butterflies themselves are\r\naware, no others of their species exist on earth: they never have seen\r\na single one of their kind, save of their own little colony. One might\r\ncompare them with the Pitcairn Islanders in the South Seas--an isolated\r\ngroup of English origin, cut off by a vast distance from all their\r\ncongeners in Europe or America. But if you go north some eight or nine\r\nhundred miles from New Hampshire to Labrador, at a certain point the\r\nsame butterfly reappears, and spreads northward toward the pole in\r\ngreat abundance. Now, how did this little colony of chilly insects get\r\nseparated from the main body, and islanded, as it were, on a remote\r\nmountain-top in far warmer New Hampshire?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, they were stranded there at the end of the Glacial\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nA couple of hundred thousand years ago or thereabouts--don't let us\r\nhaggle, I beg of you, over a few casual centuries--the whole of\r\nnorthern Europe and America was covered from end to end, as everybody\r\nknows, by a sheet of solid ice, like the one which Frithiof Nansen\r\ncrossed from sea to sea on his own account in Greenland. For many\r\nthousand years, with occasional warmer spells, that vast ice-sheet\r\nbrooded, silent and grim, over the face of the two continents. Life was\r\nextinct as far south as the latitude of New York and London. No plant\r\nor animal survived the general freezing. Not a creature broke the\r\nmonotony of that endless glacial desert. At last, as the celestial\r\ncycle came round in due season, fresh conditions supervened. Warmer\r\nweather set in, and the ice began to melt. Then the plants and animals\r\nof the sub-glacial district were pushed slowly northward by the warmth\r\nafter the retreating ice-cap. As time went on, the climate of the\r\nplains got too hot to hold them. The summer was too much for the\r\nglacial types to endure. They remained only on the highest mountain\r\npeaks or close to the southern limit of eternal snow. In this way,\r\nevery isolated range in either continent has its own little colony of\r\narctic or glacial plants and animals, which still survive by\r\nthemselves, unaffected by intercourse with their unknown and\r\nunsuspected fellow-creatures elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNot only has the Glacial epoch left these organic traces of its\r\nexistence, however; in some parts of New Hampshire, where the glaciers\r\nwere unusually thick and deep, fragments of the primæval ice itself\r\nstill remain on the spots where they were originally stranded. Among\r\nthe shady glens of the white mountains there occur here and there great\r\nmasses of ancient ice, the unmelted remnant of primæval glaciers; and\r\none of these is so large that an artificial cave has been cleverly\r\nexcavated in it, as an attraction for tourists, by the canny Yankee\r\nproprietor. Elsewhere the old ice-blocks are buried under the _débris_\r\nof moraine-stuff and alluvium, and are only accidentally discovered by\r\nthe sinking of what are locally known as ice-wells. No existing\r\nconditions can account for the formation of such solid rocks of ice at\r\nsuch a depth in the soil. They are essentially glacier-like in origin\r\nand character: they result from the pressure of snow into a crystalline\r\nmass in a mountain valley: and they must have remained there unmelted\r\never since the close of the Glacial epoch, which, by Dr. Croll's\r\ncalculations, must most probably have ceased to plague our earth some\r\neighty thousand years ago. Modern America, however, has no respect for\r\nantiquity: and it is at present engaged in using up this palæocrystic\r\ndeposit--this belated storehouse of prehistoric ice--in the manufacture\r\nof gin slings and brandy cocktails.\r\n\r\nAs one scales a mountain of moderate height--say seven or eight\r\nthousand feet--in a temperate climate, one is sure to be struck by the\r\ngradual diminution as one goes in the size of the trees, till at last\r\nthey tail off into mere shrubs and bushes. This diminution--an old\r\ncommonplace of tourists--is a marked characteristic of mountain plants,\r\nand it depends, of course, in the main upon the effect of cold, and of\r\nthe wind in winter. Cold, however, is by far the more potent factor of\r\nthe two, though it is the least often insisted upon: and this can be\r\nseen in a moment by anyone who remembers that trees shade off in just\r\nthe self-same manner near the southern limit of permanent snow in the\r\nArctic regions. And the way the cold acts is simply this: it nips off\r\nthe young buds in spring in exposed situations, as the chilly\r\nsea-breeze does with coast plants, which, as we commonly but\r\nincorrectly say, are \"blown sideways\" from seaward.\r\n\r\nOf course, the lower down one gets, and the nearer to the soil, the\r\nwarmer the layer of air becomes, both because there is greater\r\nradiation, and because one can secure a little more shelter. So, very\r\nfar north, and very near the snow-line on mountains, you always find\r\nthe vegetation runs low and stunted. It takes advantage of every crack,\r\nevery cranny in the rocks, every sunny little nook, every jutting point\r\nor wee promontory of shelter. And as the mountain plants have been\r\naccustomed for ages to the strenuous conditions of such cold and\r\nwind-swept situations, they have ended, of course, by adapting\r\nthemselves to that station in life to which it has pleased the powers\r\nthat be to call them. They grow quite naturally low and stumpy and\r\nrosette-shaped: they are compact of form and very hard of fibre: they\r\npresent no surface of resistance to the wind in any way; rounded and\r\nboss-like, they seldom rise above the level of the rooks and stones,\r\nwhose interstices they occupy. It is this combination of characters\r\nthat makes mountain plants such favourites with florists: for they\r\npossess of themselves that close-grown habit and that rich profusion of\r\nclustered flowers which it is the grand object of the gardener by\r\nartificial selection to produce and encourage.\r\n\r\nWhen one talks of the 'the limit of trees' on a mountain side, however,\r\nit must be remembered that the phrase is used in a strictly human or\r\nPickwickian sense, and that it is only the size, not the type, of the\r\nvegetation that is really in question. For trees exist even on the\r\nhighest hill-tops: only they have accommodated themselves to the\r\nexigencies of the situation. Smaller and ever smaller species have been\r\ndeveloped by natural selection to suit the peculiarities of these\r\ninclement spots. Take, for example, the willow and poplar group. Nobody\r\nwould deny that a weeping willow by an English river, or a Lombardy\r\npoplar in an Italian avenue, was as much of a true tree as an oak or a\r\nchestnut. But as one mounts towards the bare and wind-swept mountain\r\nheights one finds that the willows begin to grow downward gradually.\r\nThe 'netted willow' of the Alps and Pyrenees, which shelters itself\r\nunder the lee of little jutting rocks, attains the height of only a few\r\ninches; while the 'herbaceous willow,' common on all very high\r\nmountains in Western Europe, is a tiny creeping weed, which nobody\r\nwould ever take for a forest tree by origin at all, unless he happened\r\nto see it in the catkin-bearing stage, when its true nature and history\r\nwould become at once apparent to him.\r\n\r\nYet this little herb-like willow, one of the most northerly and hardy\r\nof European plants, is a true tree at heart none the less for all that.\r\nSoft and succulent as it looks in branch and leaf, you may yet count on\r\nit sometimes as many rings of annual growth as on a lordly Scotch\r\nfir-tree. But where? Why, underground. For see how cunning it is, this\r\nlittle stunted descendant of proud forest lords: hard-pressed by\r\nnature, it has learnt to make the best of its difficult and precarious\r\nposition. It has a woody trunk at core, like all other trees; but this\r\ntrunk never appears above the level of the soil: it creeps and roots\r\nunderground in tortuous zigzags between the crags and boulders that lie\r\nstrewn through its thin sheet of upland leaf-mould. By this simple plan\r\nthe willow manages to get protection in winter, on the same principle\r\nas when we human gardeners lay down the stems of vines: only the willow\r\nremains laid down all the year and always. But in summer it sends up\r\nits short-lived herbaceous branches, covered with tiny green leaves,\r\nand ending at last in a single silky catkin. Yet between the great\r\nweeping willow and this last degraded mountain representative of the\r\nsame primitive type, you can trace in Europe alone at least a dozen\r\ndistinct intermediate forms, all well marked in their differences, and\r\nall progressively dwarfed by long stress of unfavourable conditions.\r\n\r\nFrom the combination of such unfavourable conditions in Arctic\r\ncountries and under the snow-line of mountains there results a curious\r\nfact, already hinted at above, that the coldest floras are also, from\r\nthe purely human point of view, the most beautiful. Not, of course, the\r\nmost luxuriant: for lush richness of foliage and 'breadth of tropic\r\nshade' (to quote a noble lord) one must go, as everyone knows, to the\r\nequatorial regions. But, contrary to the common opinion, the tropics,\r\nhoary shams, are not remarkable for the abundance or beauty of their\r\nflowers. Quite otherwise, indeed: an unrelieved green strikes the\r\nkeynote of equatorial forests. This is my own experience, and it is\r\nborne out (which is far more important) by Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace,\r\nwho has seen a wider range of the untouched tropics, in all four\r\nhemispheres--northern, southern, eastern, western--than any other man,\r\nI suppose, that ever lived on this planet. And Mr. Wallace is firm in\r\nhis conviction that the tropics in this respect are a complete fraud.\r\nBright flowers are there quite conspicuously absent. It is rather in\r\nthe cold and less favoured regions of the world that one must look for\r\nfine floral displays and bright masses of colour. Close up to the\r\nsnow-line the wealth of flowers is always the greatest.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand this apparent paradox one must remember that the\r\nhighest type of flowers, from the point of view of organisation, is not\r\nat the same time by any means the most beautiful. On the contrary,\r\nplants with very little special adaptation to any particular insect,\r\nlike the water-lilies and the poppies, are obliged to flaunt forth in\r\nvery brilliant hues, and to run to very large sizes in order to attract\r\nthe attention of a great number of visitors, one or other of whom may\r\ncasually fertilise them; while plants with very special adaptations,\r\nlike the sage and mint group, or the little English orchids, are so\r\ncunningly arranged that they can't fail of fertilisation at the very\r\nfirst visit, which of course enables them to a great extent to dispense\r\nwith the aid of big or brilliant petals. So that, where the struggle\r\nfor life is fiercest, and adaptation most perfect, the flora will on\r\nthe whole be not most, but least, conspicuous in the matter of very\r\nhandsome flowers.\r\n\r\nNow, the struggle for life is fiercest, and the wealth of nature is\r\ngreatest, one need hardly say, in tropical climates. There alone do we\r\nfind every inch of soil 'encumbered by its waste fertility,' as Comus\r\nputs it; weighed down by luxuriant growth of tree, shrub, herb,\r\ncreeper. There alone do lizards lurk in every hole; beetles dwell\r\nmanifold in every cranny; butterflies flock thick in every grove; bees,\r\nants, and flies swarm by myriads on every sun-smitten hillside.\r\nAccordingly, in the tropics, adaptation reaches its highest point; and\r\ntangled richness, not beauty of colour, becomes the dominant note of\r\nthe equatorial forests. Now and then, to be sure, as you wander through\r\nBrazilian or Malayan woods, you may light upon some bright tree clad in\r\nscarlet bloom, or some glorious orchid drooping pendant from a bough\r\nwith long sprays of beauty: but such sights are infrequent. Green, and\r\ngreen, and ever green again--that is the general feeling of the\r\nequatorial forest: as different as possible from the rich mosaic of a\r\nhigh alp in early June, or a Scotch hillside deep in golden gorse and\r\npurple heather in broad August sunshine.\r\n\r\nIn very cold countries, on the other hand, though the conditions are\r\nsevere, the struggle for existence is not really so hard, because, in\r\none word, there are fewer competitors. The field is less occupied; life\r\nis less rich, less varied, less self-strangling. And therefore\r\nspecialisation hasn't gone nearly so far in cold latitudes or\r\naltitudes. Lower and simpler types everywhere occupy the soil; mosses,\r\nmatted flowers, small beetles, dwarf butterflies. Nature is less\r\nluxuriant, yet in some ways more beautiful. As we rise on the mountains\r\nthe forest trees disappear, and with them the forest beasts, from bears\r\nto squirrels; a low, wind-swept vegetation succeeds, very poor in\r\nspecies, and stunted in growth, but making a floor of rich flowers\r\nalmost unknown elsewhere. The humble butterflies and beetles of the\r\nchillier elevation produce in the result more beautiful bloom than the\r\nhighly developed honey-seekers of the richer and warmer lowlands.\r\nLuxuriance is atoned for by a Turkey carpet of floral magnificence.\r\n\r\nHow, then, has the world at large fallen into the pardonable error of\r\nbelieving tropical nature to be so rich in colouring, and circumpolar\r\nnature to be so dingy and unlovable? Simply thus, I believe. The\r\ntropics embrace the largest land areas in the world, and are richer by\r\na thousand times in species of plants and animals than all the rest of\r\nthe earth in a lump put together. That richness necessarily results\r\nfrom the fierceness of the competition. Now among this enormous mass of\r\ntropical plants it naturally happens that some have finer flowers than\r\nany temperate species; while as to the animals and birds, they are\r\nundoubtedly, on the whole, both larger and handsomer than the fauna of\r\ncolder climates. But in the general aspect of tropical nature an\r\noccasional bright flower or brilliant parrot counts for very little\r\namong the mass of lush green which surrounds and conceals it. On the\r\nother hand, in our museums and conservatories we sedulously pick out\r\nthe rarest and most beautiful of these rare and beautiful species, and\r\nwe isolate them completely from their natural surroundings. The\r\nconsequence is that the untravelled mind regards the tropics mentally\r\nas a sort of perpetual replica of the hot-houses at Kew, superimposed\r\non the best of Mr. Bull's orchid shows. As a matter of fact, people who\r\nknow the hot world well can tell you that the average tropical woodland\r\nis much more like the dark shade of Box Hill or the deepest glades of\r\nthe Black Forest. For really fine floral display in the mass, all at\r\nonce, you must go, not to Ceylon, Sumatra, Jamaica, but to the far\r\nnorth of Canada, the Bernese Oberland, the moors of Inverness-shire,\r\nthe North Cape of Norway. Flowers are loveliest where the climate is\r\ncoldest; forests are greenest, most luxuriant, least blossoming, where\r\nthe conditions of life are richest, warmest, fiercest. In one word,\r\nHigh Life is always poor but beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EIGHT-LEGGED FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nA singular opportunity was afforded me last summer for making myself\r\nthoroughly at home with the habits and manners of the common English\r\ngeometrical spider. By the pure chance of circumstance, two ladies of\r\nthat intelligent and interesting species were kind enough to select for\r\ntheir temporary residence a large pane of glass just outside my\r\ndrawing-room window. Now, it so happened that this particular pane was\r\nconstructed not to open, being, in fact, part of a big bow-window, the\r\nalternate sashes of which were alone intended for ventilation. Hence it\r\ncame to pass that by diligent care I was enabled to preserve my two\r\neight-legged acquaintances from the devouring broom of the British\r\nhousemaid, and to keep them constantly under observation at all times\r\nand seasons during a whole summer. Of course this result was only\r\nobtained by a distinct exercise of despotic authority, for I know those\r\npoor spiders were a constant eyesore in Ellen's sight--the housemaid of\r\nthe moment bore the name of Ellen--but I persisted in my prohibition of\r\nany forcible ejectment, and I carried my point in the end in the very\r\nteeth of that constituted domestic authority. So successful was I,\r\nindeed, that when at last we flitted southwards ourselves with the\r\nswallows on our annual migration to the Mediterranean shores, we left\r\nLucy and Eliza--those were the names we had given them--in undisturbed\r\npossession of their prescriptive rights in the drawing-room windows.\r\nThis year they are gone, and our home is left spiderless.\r\n\r\nThey were curious and uninviting pets, I'm bound to admit, those great\r\njuicy-looking creatures. Nobody could say that any form of spider is\r\nprecisely what our Italian friends prettily describe in their liquid\r\nway as _simpatico_. At times, indeed, the conduct of Lucy and Eliza was\r\nso peculiarly horrible and blood-curdling in its atrocity, that even I,\r\ntheir best friend, who had so often interceded for their lives and\r\nsaved them from the devastating duster of the aggressive\r\nhousemaid--even I myself, I say, more than once debated in my own mind\r\nwhether I was justified in letting them go on any longer in their\r\ncareer of crime unchecked, or whether I ought not rather to rush out at\r\nonce, avenging rag in hand, and sweep them away at one fell swoop from\r\nthe surface of a world they disgraced with their unbridled wickedness.\r\nEliza, in particular, I'm constrained to allow, was a perfect monster\r\nof vice--a sort of undeveloped arachnid Borgia, quick to slay and\r\nrelentless in pursuit; a mass of eight-legged sins, stained with the\r\ncolourless gore of ten thousand struggling victims, and absolutely\r\nwithout a single redeeming point in her hateful character. And yet,\r\nwhenever any more than usually horrible massacre of some pretty and\r\ninnocent fly almost moved me in my righteous wrath to rush out into the\r\ngarden in hot haste and put an end at once to the cruel wretch's\r\nexistence with a judicial antimacassar, a number of moral scruples,\r\nsuch as could only be adequately resolved by the editor of the\r\n_Spectator_, always occurred spontaneously to my mind and conscience\r\njust in time to ensure that wicked Eliza a fresh spell of life in which\r\nto continue unabashed her atrocious behaviour.\r\n\r\nHas man, I asked myself at such moments, mere human man, any right to\r\nset himself up in the place of earthly providence, as so much better\r\nand more moral than insentient nature? If the spider cruelly devours\r\nliving flies and intelligent or highly sensitive bees, we must at least\r\nremember that she has no choice in the matter, and that, as the poet\r\njustly remarks, ''tis her nature to.' But then, on the other hand, it\r\nmight be plausibly argued that 'tis our nature equally to kill the\r\ncreature that we see so hatefully fulfilling the law of its own cruel\r\nbeing. And yet again it might be pleaded by any able counsel who\r\nundertook the defence of Lucy or Eliza on her trial for her life\r\nagainst her human accusers, that she was impelled to all these evil\r\ndeeds by maternal affection, one of the noblest and most unselfish of\r\nanimal instincts. Moreover, if the spider didn't prey, it would\r\nobviously die; and it seems rather hard on any creature to condemn it\r\nto death for no better reason than because it happens to have been born\r\na member of its own kind, and not of any other and less morally\r\nobjectionable species. Jedburgh justice o£ that sort rather savours of\r\nthe method pursued by the famous countryman who was found cutting a\r\nharmless amphibian into a hundred pieces with his murderous spade, and\r\nsaying spitefully as he did so, at every particularly savage cut: 'I'll\r\nlarn ye to be a twoad, I will; I'll larn ye to be a twoad!'\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of all this my vaunted philosophy, I will\r\nfrankly confess that more than once Eliza and Lucy sorely tried my\r\npatience, and that I was often a good deal better than half-minded in\r\nmy soul to rush out in a feverish fit of moral indignation and put an\r\nend to their ghastly career of crime without waiting to hear what they\r\nhad to say in their own favour, showing cause why sentence of death\r\nshould not be executed upon them. And I would have done it, I believe,\r\nhad it not been for that peculiar arrangement of the drawing-room\r\nwindows, which made it impossible to get at the culprits direct,\r\nwithout going out into the garden and round the house; which, of\r\ncourse, is a severe strain in wet or windy weather to put upon\r\nanybody's moral enthusiasm. In the end, therefore, I always gave the\r\nevil-doers the benefit of the doubt; and I only mention my ethical\r\nscruples in the matter here lest scoffers should say, when they come to\r\nread what manner of things Lucy and Eliza did: 'Oh yes, that's just\r\nlike those scientific folks; they're always so cold-blooded. He could\r\nstand by and see these poor helpless flies tortured slowly to death,\r\nwithout a chance for their lives, and never put out a helping hand to\r\nsave them!' Well, I would only ask you one question, my sapient friend,\r\nwho talk like that: Has it ever occurred to you that, if you kill one\r\nspider, you merely make room in the overflowing economy of nature for\r\nanother to pick up a dishonest livelihood? Have you ever reflected that\r\nthe prime blame of spiderhood rests with Nature herself (if we may\r\nventure to personify that impersonal entity); and that she has provided\r\nsuch a constant supply or relay of spiders as will amply suffice to\r\nfill up all the possible vacancies that can ever occur in insect-eating\r\ncircles? Unless you have considered all these points carefully, and\r\nhave an answer to give about them, you are not in a position to\r\npronounce upon the subject, and you had better be referred for six\r\nmonths longer, as the medical examiners gracefully put it, to your\r\nethical, psychological, and biological studies. The great point about\r\nthe position in which Eliza and Lucy had placed themselves was simply\r\nthis. They stood full against the light, so that we could see right\r\nthrough their translucent bodies, which were almost liquid to look\r\nupon, and beautifully dappled with dark spots on a grey ground in a\r\nvery pretty and effective pattern. So favourable was the opportunity\r\nfor observation, indeed, that we could clearly make out with the naked\r\neye even the joints of their legs, the hairs on their tarsi--excuse the\r\nphrase--and the very shape of their cruel tigerlike claws, as they\r\nrushed forth upon their prey in a sort of carnivorous frenzy. At all\r\nhours of the day we could notice exactly what they were doing or\r\nsuffering; and so familiar did we become with them individually and\r\npersonally, that before the end of the season we recognized in detail\r\nall the differences of their characters almost as one might do with\r\ncats or dogs, and spoke of them by their Christian names like old and\r\nwell-known acquaintances.\r\n\r\nAs the webs which Lucy and Eliza spun were several times broken or\r\nmutilated during the year, either by accident or the gardener, we had\r\nplenty of chances for seeing how they proceeded in making them. The\r\nlines were in both cases stretched between a white rose-bush that\r\nclimbed up one side of the window, and a purple clematis that occupied\r\nand draped the opposite mullion. But Lucy and Eliza didn't live in the\r\nwebs--those were only their snares or traps for prey; each of them had\r\nin addition a private home or apartment of her own under shelter of a\r\nrose-leaf at some distance from the treacherous geometrical structure.\r\nThe house itself consisted merely of a silken cell, built out from the\r\nrose-leaf, and connected with the snare by a single stout cord of very\r\nsolid construction. On this cord the spider kept one foot--I had almost\r\nsaid one hand--constantly fixed. She poised it lightly by her claws,\r\nand whenever an insect got entangled in the web, a subtle electric\r\nmessage, so to speak, seemed to run along the line to the ever-watchful\r\ncarnivore. In one short second Lucy or Eliza, as the case might be, had\r\ndarted out upon her quarry, and was tackling it might main, according\r\nto the particular way its size and strength rendered then and there\r\nadvisable. The method of procedure, which I shall describe more fully\r\nby-and-by, differed considerably from case to case, as these very large\r\nand strong spiders have sometimes to deal with mere tiny midges, and\r\nsometimes with extremely big and dangerous creatures, like bumble-bees,\r\nwasps, and even hornets.\r\n\r\nIn building their webs, as in many other small points, Lucy and Eliza\r\nshowed from the first no inconsiderable personal differences. Lucy\r\nbegan hers by spinning a long line from her spinnerets, and letting the\r\nwind carry it wherever it would; while Eliza, more architectural in\r\ncharacter, preferred to take her lines personally from point to point,\r\nand see herself to their proper fastening. In either case, however, the\r\nfirst thing done was to stretch some eight or ten stout threads from\r\nplace to place on the outside of the future web, to act as _points\r\nd'appuy_ for the remainder of the structure. To these outer threads,\r\nwhich the spiders strengthened so as to bear a considerable strain by\r\ndoubling and trebling them, other thinner single threads were then\r\ncarried radially at irregular distances, like the spokes of a wheel,\r\nfrom a point in the centre, where they were all made fast and connected\r\ntogether. As soon as this radiating framework or scaffolding was\r\nfinished, like the woof on a loom, the industrious craftswoman started\r\nat the middle, and began the task of putting in the cross-pieces or\r\nweft which were to complete and bind together the circular pattern.\r\nThese she wove round and round in a continuous spiral, setting out at\r\nthe centre, and keeping on in ever-widening circlets, till she arrived\r\nat last at the exterior or foundation threads. How she fastened these\r\ncross-pieces to the ray-lines I could never quite make out, though I\r\noften followed the work closely from inside through the pane of glass\r\nwith a platyscopic lens; for, strange to say, the spiders were not in\r\nthe least disturbed by being watched at their work, and never took the\r\nslightest notice of anything that went on at the other side of the\r\nwindow. My impression is, however, that she gummed them together,\r\nletting them harden into one as they dried; for the thread itself is\r\nalways semi-liquid when first exuded.\r\n\r\nThe cross-pieces, we observed from the very beginning, were invariably\r\ncovered by little sparkling drops of something wet and beadlike, which\r\nat first in our ignorance we took for dew; for until I began\r\nsystematically observing Lucy and Eliza, I will frankly confess I had\r\nnever paid any particular attention to the spider-kind with the\r\nsolitary exception of my old winter friends, the trap-door spiders of\r\nthe Mediterranean shores. But, after a little experience, we soon found\r\nout that these pearly drops on the web were not dew at all, but a\r\nsticky substance, akin, to that of the web, secreted by the animals\r\nthemselves from their own bodies. We also quickly discovered, coming to\r\nthe observation as we did with minds unbiased by previous knowledge,\r\nthat the viscid liquid in question was of the utmost importance to the\r\nspiders in securing their prey, and that unfortunate insects were not\r\nmerely entangled but likewise gummed down or glued by it, like birds in\r\nbird-lime or flies in treacle. So necessary is the sticky stuff,\r\nindeed, to the success of the trap, that Lucy and Eliza used to renew\r\nthe entire set of cross-pieces in the web every morning, and thus\r\nensure from day to day a perfectly fresh supply of viscid fluid; but,\r\nso far as I could see, they only renewed the rays and the\r\nfoundation-threads under stress of necessity, when the snare had been\r\nso greatly injured by large insects struggling in it, or by the wind or\r\nthe gardener, as to render repairs absolutely unavoidable. The whole\r\nstructure, when complete, is so beautiful and wonderful a sight, with\r\nits geometrical regularity and its beaded drops, that if it were\r\nproduced by a rare creature from Madagascar or the Cape, in the\r\ninsect-house at the Zoo, all the world, I'm convinced, would rush to\r\nlook at it as a nine-days' wonder. But since it's only the trap of the\r\ncommon English garden spider, why, we all pass it by without deigning\r\neven to glance at it.\r\n\r\nAt night my eight-legged friends slept always in their own homes or\r\nnests under shelter of the rose-leaves. But during the day they\r\nalternated between the nest and the centre of the web, which last\r\nseemed to serve them as a convenient station where they waited for\r\ntheir prey, standing head downward with legs wide spread on the rays,\r\non the look-out for incidents. Whether at the centre or in the nest,\r\nhowever, they kept their feet constantly on the watch for any\r\ndisturbance on the webs; and the instant any unhappy little fly got\r\nentangled in their meshes, the ever-watchful spider was out like a\r\nflash of lightning, and down at once in full force upon that incautious\r\nintruder. I was convinced after many observations that it is by touch\r\nalone the spider recognizes the presence of prey in its web, and that\r\nit hardly derives any indications worth speaking of from its numerous\r\nlittle eyes, at least as regards the arrival of booty. If a very big\r\ninsect has got into the web, then a relatively large volume of\r\ndisturbance is propagated along the telegraphic wire that runs from the\r\nsnare to the house, or from the circumference to the centre; if a small\r\none, then a slight disturbance; and the spider rushes out accordingly,\r\neither with an air of caution or of ferocious triumph.\r\n\r\nSupposing the booty in hand was a tiny fly, then Lucy or Eliza would\r\njump upon it at once with that strange access of apparently personal\r\nanimosity with seems in some mysterious way a characteristic of all\r\nhunting carnivorous animals. She would then carelessly wind a thread or\r\ntwo about it, in a perfunctory way, bury her jaws in its body, and in\r\nless than half a minute suck out its juices to the last drop, leaving\r\nthe empty shell unhurt, like a dry skeleton or the slough of a\r\ndragon-fly larva. But when wasps or other large and dangerous insects\r\ngot entangled in the webs, the hunters proceeded with far greater\r\ncaution. Lucy, indeed, who was a decided coward, would stand and look\r\nanxiously at the doubtful intruder for several seconds, feeling the web\r\nwith her claws, and running up and down in the most undecided manner,\r\nas if in doubt whether or not to tackle the uncertain customer. But\r\nEliza, whose spirits always rose like Nelson's before the face of\r\ndanger, and whose motto seemed to be '_De l'audace, de l'audace, et\r\ntoujours de l'audace_,' would rush at the huge foe in a perfect\r\ntransport of wild fury, and go to work at once to enclose him in her\r\ntoils of triple silken cables. I always fancied, indeed, that Eliza was\r\nin a thoroughly housewifely tantrum at seeing her nice new web so\r\nruthlessly torn and tattered by the unwelcome visitor, and that she\r\nsaid to herself in her own language: 'Oh well, then, if you _will_ have\r\nit, you _shall_ have it; so here goes for you.' And go for him she did,\r\nwith most unladylike ferocity. Indeed, Eliza's best friend, I must fain\r\nadmit, could never have said of her that she was a perfect lady.\r\n\r\nThe chawing-up of that wasp was a sight to behold. I have no great\r\nsympathy with wasps--they have done me so many bad turns in my time\r\nthat I don't pretend to regard them as deserving of exceptional\r\npity--but I must say Eliza's way of going at them was unduly barbaric.\r\nShe treated them for all the world as if they were entirely devoid of a\r\nnervous system. I wouldn't treat a _Saturday Reviewer_ myself as that\r\nspider treated the wasps when once she was sure of them. She went at\r\nthem with a sort of angry, half-contemptuous dash, kept cautiously out\r\nof the way of the protruded sting, began in most business-like fashion\r\nat the head, and rolling the wasp round and round with her legs and\r\nfeelers, swathed him rapidly and effectually, with incredible speed, in\r\na dense network of web poured forth from her spinnerets. In less than\r\nhalf a minute the astonished wasp, accustomed rather to act on the\r\noffensive than the defensive, found himself helplessly enclosed in a\r\nperfect coil of tangled silk, which confined him from head to sting\r\nwithout the possibility of movement in any direction. The whole time\r\nthis had been going on the victim, struggling and writhing, had been\r\npushing out its sting and doing the very best it knew to deal the wily\r\nEliza a poisoned death-blow. But Eliza, taught by ancestral experience,\r\nkept carefully out of the way; and the wasp felt itself finally twirled\r\nround and round in those powerful hands, and tied about as to its wings\r\nby a thousand-fold cable. Sometimes, after the wasp was secured, Eliza\r\neven took the trouble to saw off the wings so as to prevent further\r\nstruggling and consequent damage to the precious web; but more often\r\nshe merely proceeded to eat it alive without further formality, still\r\navoiding its sting as long as the creature had a kick left in it, but\r\notherwise entirely ignoring its character as a sentient being in the\r\nmost inhuman fashion. And all the time, till the last drop of his blood\r\nwas sucked out, the wasp would continue viciously to stick out his\r\ndeadly sting, which the spider would still avoid with hereditary\r\ncunning. It was a horrid sight--a duel _à outrance_ between two equally\r\nhateful and poisonous opponents; a living commentary on the appalling\r\nbut o'er-true words of the poet, that 'Nature is one with rapine, a\r\nharm no preacher can heal.' Though these were the occasions when one\r\nsometimes felt as if the cup of Eliza's iniquities was really full, and\r\none must pass sentence at last, without respite or reprieve, upon that\r\nlife-long murderess.\r\n\r\nOne insect there was, however, before which even Eliza herself,\r\nhardened wretch as she seemed, used to cower and shiver; and that was\r\nthe great black bumble-bee, the largest and most powerful of the\r\nBritish bee-kind. When one of these dangerous monsters, a burly,\r\nbuzzing bourgeois, got entangled in her web, Eliza, shaking in her\r\nshoes (I allow her those shoes by poetical licence) would retire in\r\nhigh dudgeon to her inmost bower, and there would sit and sulk, in\r\nvisible bad temper, till the clumsy big thing, after many futile\r\nefforts, had torn its way by main force out of the coils that\r\nsurrounded it. Then, the moment the telegraphic communication told her\r\nthe lines in the web were once more free, Eliza would sally forth again\r\nwith a smiling face--oh yes, I assure you, we could tell by her look\r\nwhen she was smiling--and would repair afresh with cheerful alacrity\r\nthe damage done to her snare by the unwelcome visitor. Hummingbird\r\nhawk-moths, on the other hand, though so big and quick, she would kill\r\nimmediately. As for Lucy, craven soul, she had so little sense of\r\nproper pride and arachnid honour, that she shrank even from the wasps\r\nwhich Eliza so bravely and unhesitatingly tackled; and more than once\r\nwe caught her in the very act of cutting them out entire, with the\r\nwhole piece of web in which they were immeshed, and letting them drop\r\non to the ground beneath, merely as a short way of getting rid of them\r\nfrom her premises. I always rather despised Lucy. She hadn't even the\r\none redeeming virtue of most carnivorous or predatory races--an\r\ninsensate and almost automatic courage.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say, however, that the spider does not kill her prey by a\r\nmere fair-and-square bite alone. She has recourse to the art of the\r\nPalmers and Brinvilliers. All spiders, as far as known, are provided\r\nwith poison-fangs in the jaws, which sometimes, as in the tarantula and\r\nmany other large tropical kinds, well known to me in Jamaica and\r\nelsewhere, are sufficiently powerful to produce serious effects upon\r\nman himself; while even much smaller spiders, like Eliza and Lucy, have\r\npoison enough in their falces, as the jawlike organs are called, to\r\nkill a good big insect, such as a wasp or a bumble-bee. These\r\nchannelled poison-glands, combined with their savage tigerlike claws,\r\nmake the spiders as a group extremely formidable and dominant\r\ncreatures, the analogues in their own smaller invertebrate world of the\r\nserpents and wolves in the vertebrate creation.\r\n\r\nLucy and Eliza's family relations, I am sorry to say, were not, we\r\nfound, of a kind to endear them to a critical public already\r\nsufficiently scandalized by their general mode of behaviour to their\r\ninoffensive neighbours. As mothers, indeed, gossip itself had not a\r\nword of blame to whisper against them; but as wives, their conduct was\r\ndistinctly open to the severest animadversion. The males of the garden\r\nspider, as in many other instances, are decidedly smaller than their\r\nbig round mates; so much so is this the case, indeed, in certain\r\nspecies that they seem almost like parasites of the immensely larger\r\nsack-bodied females. Now, just as the worker bees kill off the drones\r\nas soon as the queen-bee has been duly fertilized, regarding them as of\r\nno further importance or value to the hive, so do the lady-spiders not\r\nonly kill but eat their husbands as soon as they find they have no\r\nfurther use for them. Nay, if a female spider doesn't care for the\r\nlooks of a suitor who is pressing himself too much upon her fond\r\nattention, her way of expressing her disapprobation of his appearance\r\nand manners is to make a murderous spring at him, and, if possible,\r\ndevour him. Under these painful circumstances the process of courtship\r\nis necessarily to some extent a difficult and delicate one, fraught\r\nwith no small danger to the adventurous swain who has the boldness to\r\ncommend himself by personal approach to these very fickle and irascible\r\nfair ones. It was most curious and exciting, accordingly, to watch the\r\ndetails of the strange courtship, which we could only observe in the\r\ncase of the cruel Eliza, the rather gentler Lucy having been already\r\nmated, apparently, before she took up her quarters in our climbing\r\nwhite rose-bush. One day, however, a timid-looking male spider, with\r\ninquiry and doubt in every movement of his tarsi, strolled tentatively\r\nup on the neat round web where Eliza was hanging, head downward as\r\nusual, all her feet on the thread, on the look-out for house-flies. We\r\nknew he was a male at once by his longer and thinner body, and by his\r\nnatural modesty. He walked gingerly on all eights, like an arachnid\r\nAgag, in the direction of the object of his ardent affections, with a\r\nmost comic uncertainty in every step he took towards her. His claws\r\nfelt the threads as he moved with anxious care; and it was clear he was\r\nready at a moment's notice to jump away and flee for his life with\r\nheadlong speed to his native obscurity if Eliza showed the slightest\r\ndisposition, by gesture or movement, to turn and rend him. Now and\r\nagain, as he approached, Eliza, half coquettish, moved her feet a short\r\nstep, and seemed to debate within her own mind in which spirit she\r\nshould meet his flattering advances--whether to accept him or to eat\r\nhim. At each such hesitation, the unhappy male, fearing the worst, and\r\nsore afraid, would turn on his heel and fly for dear life as fast as\r\neight trembling legs would carry him. Then, after a minute or two, he\r\nwould evidently come to the conclusion that he had wronged his\r\nlady-love, and that her movement was one of true, true love rather than\r\nof carnivorous and cannibalistic appetite. At last, as I judged, his\r\nconstancy was rewarded, though his ominous disappearance very shortly\r\nafterwards made me fear for the worst as to his final adventures.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Eliza laid a large number of eggs in a silken cocoon, in\r\nshape a balloon, and secreted, like the web, by her invaluable\r\nspinnerets. Indeed, the real reason--I won't say excuse--for the\r\nrapacity and Gargantuan appetite of the spider lies, no doubt, in the\r\nimmense amount of material she has to supply for her daily-renewed\r\nwebs, her home, and her cocoon, all which have actually to be spun out\r\nof the assimilated food-stuffs in her own body; to say nothing of the\r\nadditional necessity imposed upon her by nature for laying a trifle of\r\nsix or seven hundred eggs in a single summer. And, to tell the truth,\r\nLucy and Eliza seemed to us to be always eating. No matter at what hour\r\none looked in upon them, they were pretty constantly engaged in\r\ndevouring some inoffensive fly, or weaving hateful labyrinths of hasty\r\ncord round some fiercely-struggling wasp or some unhappy beetle.\r\n\r\nWe weren't fortunate enough, I regret to say, to see Eliza's eggs hatch\r\nout from the cocoon; but in other instances, especially in Southern\r\nEurope, I have noticed the little heap of well-covered ova, glued\r\ntogether into a mass, and attached to a branch or twig by stout silken\r\ncables. If you open the cocoon when the young spiders are just hatched,\r\nthey begin to run about in the most lively fashion, and look like a\r\nliving and moving congeries of little balls or seedlets. The common\r\ngarden spider lays some seven hundred or more such eggs at a sitting,\r\nand out of those seven hundred only two on an average reach maturity\r\nand once more propagate their kind. For if only four lived and throve,\r\nthen clearly, in the next generation, there would be twice as many\r\nspiders as in this; and in the generation after that again, four times\r\nas many; and then eight times; and so on _ad infinitum_, until the\r\nwhole world was just one living and seething mass of common garden\r\nspiders.\r\n\r\nWhat keeps them down, then, in the end to their average number? What\r\nprevents the development of the whole seven hundred? The simple answer\r\nis, continuous starvation. As usual, nature works with cruel\r\nlavishness. There are just as many spiders at any given minute as there\r\nare insects enough in the world or in their area to feed upon. Every\r\nspider lays hundreds of eggs, so as to make up for the average infant\r\nmortality by starvation, or by the attacks of ichneumon flies, or by\r\nbeing eaten themselves in the young stage, or by other casualties. And\r\nso with all other species. Each produces as many young on the average\r\nas will allow for the ordinary infant mortality of their kind, and\r\nleave enough over just to replace the parents in the next generation.\r\nAnd that's one of the reasons why it's no use punishing Lucy and Eliza\r\nfor their misdeeds in this world. Kill them off if you will, and before\r\nnext week a dozen more like them will dispute with one another the\r\nvacant place you have thus created in the balanced economy of that\r\nmicrocosm the garden.\r\n\r\nOur observations upon Lucy and Eliza, however, had the effect of making\r\nus take an increased interest thenceforth in spiders in general, which\r\ntill that time we had treated with scant courtesy, and set us about\r\nlearning something as to the extraordinary variety of life and habit to\r\nbe found within the range of this single group of arthropods, at first\r\nsight so extremely alike in their shapes, their appearance, their\r\nmorals, and their manners. It's perfectly astonishing, though, when one\r\ncomes to look into it in detail, how exceedingly diverse spiders are in\r\ntheir mode of life, their structure, and the variety of uses to which\r\nthey put their one extremely distinctive structural organ, the\r\nspinnerets. I will only say here that some spiders use these peculiar\r\nglands to form light webs by whose aid, though wingless, they float\r\nballoon-wise through the air; that others employ them to line the sides\r\nof their underground tunnels, and to make the basis of their\r\nmarvellously ingenious earthen trap-doors; that yet others have learnt\r\nhow to adapt these same organs to a subaquatic existence, and to fill\r\ncocoons with air, like miniature diving bells; while others, again,\r\nhave taught themselves to construct webs thick enough to catch and hold\r\neven creatures so superior to themselves in the scale of being as\r\nhumming-birds and sunbirds. This extraordinary variety in the\r\nutilization of a single organ teaches once more the same lesson which\r\nis impressed upon us elsewhere by so many other forms of organic\r\nevolution: whatever enables an animal or plant to gain an advantage\r\nover others in the struggle for life, no matter in what way, is sure to\r\nsurvive, and to be turned in time to every conceivable use of which its\r\nstructure is capable, in the infinite whirligig of ever-varying nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 MUD.\r\n\r\nEven a prejudiced observer will readily admit that the most valuable\r\nmineral on earth is mud. Diamonds and rubies are just nowhere by\r\ncomparison. I don't mean weight for weight, of course--mud is 'cheap as\r\ndirt,' to buy in small quantities--but aggregate for aggregate. Quite\r\nliterally, and without hocus-pocus of any sort, the money valuation of\r\nthe mud in the world must outnumber many thousand times the money\r\nvaluation of all the other minerals put together. Only we reckon it\r\nusually not by the ton, but by the acre, though the acre is worth most\r\nwhere the mud lies deepest. Nay, more, the world's wealth is wholly\r\nbased on mud. Corn, not gold, is the true standard of value. Without\r\nmud there would be no human life, no productions of any kind: for food\r\nstuffs of every description are raised on mud; and where no mud exists,\r\nor can be made to exist, there, we say, there is desert or sand-waste.\r\nLand, without mud, has no economic value. To put it briefly, the only\r\nparts of the world that count much for human habitation are the mud\r\ndeposits of the great rivers, and notably of the Nile, the Euphrates,\r\nthe Ganges, the Indus, the Irrawaddy, the Hoang Ho, the Yang-tse-Kiang;\r\nof the Po, the Rhone, the Danube, the Rhine, the Volga, the Dnieper; of\r\nthe St. Lawrence, the Mississippi, the Missouri, the Orinoco, the\r\nAmazons, the La Plata. A corn-field is just a big mass of mud; and the\r\ndeeper and purer and freer from stones or other impurities it is the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nBut England, you say, is not a great river-mud field; yet it supports\r\nthe densest population in the world. True; but England is an\r\nexceptional product of modern civilization. She can't feed herself: she\r\nis fed from Odessa, Alexandria, Bombay, New York, Montreal, Buenos\r\nAyres--in other words, from the mud fields of the Russian, the\r\nEgyptian, the Indian, the American, the Canadian, the Argentine rivers.\r\nOrontes, said Juvenal, has flowed into Tiber; Nile, we may say\r\nnowadays, with equal truth, has flowed into Thames.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to make one realize the importance of mud, indeed,\r\nlike a journey up Nile when the inundation is just over. You lounge on\r\nthe deck of your dahabieh, and drink in geography almost without\r\nknowing it. The voyage forms a perfect introduction to the study of\r\nmudology, and suggests to the observant mind (meaning you and me) the\r\nreal nature of mud as nothing else on earth that I know of can suggest\r\nit. For in Egypt you get your phenomenon isolated, as it were, from all\r\ndisturbing elements. You have no rainfall to bother you, no local\r\nstreams, no complex denudation: the Nile does all, and the Nile does\r\neverything. On either hand stretches away the bare desert, rising up in\r\ngrey rocky hills. Down the midst runs the one long line of alluvial\r\nsoil--in other words, Nile mud--which alone allows cultivation and life\r\nin that rainless district. The country bases itself absolutely on mud.\r\nThe crops are raised on it; the houses and villages are built of it;\r\nthe land is manured with it; the very air is full of it. The crude\r\nbrick buildings that dissolve in dust are Nile mud solidified; the red\r\npottery of Assiout is Nile mud baked hard; the village mosques and\r\nminarets are Nile mud whitewashed. I have even seen a ship's bulwarks\r\nneatly repaired with mud. It pervades the whole land, when wet, as mud\r\nundisguised; when dry, as dust-storm.\r\n\r\nEgypt, says Herodotus, is a gift of the Nile. A truer or more pregnant\r\nword was never spoken. Of course it is just equally true, in a way,\r\nthat Bengal is a gift of the Ganges, and that Louisiana and Arkansas\r\nare gifts of the Mississippi; but with this difference, that in the\r\ncase of the Nile the dependence is far more obvious, far freer from\r\ndisturbing or distracting details. For that reason, and also because\r\nthe Nile is so much more familiar to most English-speaking folk than\r\nthe American rivers, I choose Egypt first as my type of a regular\r\nmud-land. But in order to understand it fully you mustn't stop all your\r\ntime in Cairo and the Delta; you mustn't view it only from the terrace\r\nof Shepheard's Hotel or the rocky platform of the Great Pyramid at\r\nGhizeh: you must push up country early, under Mr. Cook's care, to Luxor\r\nand the First Cataract. It is up country that Egypt unrolls itself\r\nvisibly before your eyes in the very process of making: it is there\r\nthat the full importance of good, rich black mud first forces itself\r\nupon you by undeniable evidence.\r\n\r\nFor remember that, from a point above Berber to the sea, the dwindling\r\nNile never receives a single tributary, a single drop of fresh water.\r\nFor more than fifteen hundred miles the ever-lessening river rolls on\r\nbetween bare desert hills and spreads fertility over the deep valley in\r\ntheir midst--just as far as its own mud sheet can cover the barren\r\nrocky bottom, and no farther. For the most part the line of demarcation\r\nbetween the grey bare desert and the cultivable plain is as clear and\r\nas well-defined as the margin of sea and land: you can stand with one\r\nfoot on the barren rock and one on the green soil of the tilled and\r\nirrigated mud-land. For the water rises up to a certain level, and to\r\nthat level accordingly it distributes both mud and moisture: above it\r\ncomes the arid rock, as destitute of life, as dead and bare and lonely\r\nas the centre of Sahara. In and out, in waving line, up to the base of\r\nthe hills, cultivation and greenery follow, with absolute accuracy, the\r\nline of highest flood-level; beyond it the hot rock stretches dreary\r\nand desolate. Here and there islands of sandstone stand out above the\r\ngreen sea of doura or cotton; here and there a bay of fertility runs\r\naway up some lateral valley, following the course of the mud; but one\r\ninch above the inundation-mark vegetation and life stop short all at\r\nonce with absolute abruptness. In Egypt, then, more than anywhere else,\r\none sees with one's own eyes that mud and moisture are the very\r\nconditions of mundane fertility.\r\n\r\nBeyond Cairo, as one descends seaward, the mud begins to open out\r\nfan-wise and form a delta. The narrow mountain ranges no longer hem it\r\nin. It has room to expand and spread itself freely over the surrounding\r\ncountry, won by degrees from the Mediterranean. At the mouths the mud\r\npours out into the sea and forms fresh deposits constantly on the\r\nbottom, which are gradually silting up still newer lands to seaward.\r\nSlow as is the progress of this land-forming action, there can be no\r\ndoubt that the Nile has the intention of filling up by degrees the\r\nwhole eastern Mediterranean, and that in process of time--say in no\r\nmore than a few million years or so, a mere bagatelle to the\r\ngeologist--with the aid of the Po and some other lesser streams, it\r\nwill transform the entire basin of the inland sea into a level and\r\ncultivable plain, like Bengal or Mesopotamia, themselves (as we shall\r\nsee) the final result of just such silting action.\r\n\r\nIt is so very important, for those who wish to see things \"as clear as\r\nmud,\" to understand this prime principle of the formation of mud-lands,\r\nthat I shall make no apology for insisting on it further in some little\r\ndetail; for when one comes to look the matter plainly in the face, one\r\ncan see in a minute that almost all the big things in human history\r\nhave been entirely dependent upon the mud of the great rivers. Thebes\r\nand Memphis, Rameses and Amenhotep, based their civilisation absolutely\r\nupon the mud of Nile. The bricks of Babylon were moulded of Euphrates\r\nmud; the greatness of Nineveh reposed on the silt of the Tigris. Upper\r\nIndia is the Indus; Agra and Delhi are Ganges and Jumna mud; China is\r\nthe Hoang Ho and the Yang-tse-Kiang; Burmah is the paddy field of the\r\nIrrawaddy delta. And so many great plains in either hemisphere consist\r\nreally of nothing else but mud-banks of almost incredible extent,\r\nfilling up prehistoric Baltics and Mediterraneans, that a glance at the\r\nprobable course of future evolution in this respect may help us to\r\nunderstand and to realize more fully the gigantic scale of some past\r\naccumulations.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary canter I shall trot out first the valley of the Po,\r\nthe existing mud flat best known by personal experience to the feet and\r\neyes of the tweed-clad English tourist. Everybody who has looked down\r\nupon the wide Lombard plain from the pinnacled roof of Milan Cathedral,\r\nor who has passed by rail through that monotonous level of poplars and\r\nvines between Verona and Venice, knows well what a mud flat due to\r\ninundation and gradual silting up of a valley looks like. What I want\r\nto do now is to inquire into its origin, and to follow up in fancy the\r\nsame process, still in action, till it has filled the Adriatic from end\r\nto end with one great cultivable lowland.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time (I like to be at least as precise as a fairy tale in\r\nthe matter of dates) there was no Lombardy. And that time was not,\r\ngeologically speaking, so very remote; for the whole valley of the Po,\r\nfrom Turin to the sea, consists entirely of alluvial deposits--or, in\r\nother words, of Alpine mud--which has all accumulated where it now lies\r\nat a fairly recent period. We know it is recent, because no part of\r\nItaly has ever been submerged since it began to gather there. To put it\r\nmore definitely, the entire mass has almost certainly been laid down\r\nsince the first appearance of man on our earth: the earliest human\r\nbeings who reached the Alps or the Apennines--black savages clad in\r\nskins of extinct wild beasts--must have looked down from their slopes,\r\nwith shaded eyes, not on a level plain such as we see to-day, but on a\r\ngreat arm of the sea which stretched like a gulf far up towards the\r\nbase of the hills about Turin and Rivoli. Of this ancient sea the\r\nAdriatic forms the still unsilted portion. In other words, the great\r\ngulf which now stops short at Trieste and Venice once washed the foot\r\nof the Alps and the Apennines to the Superga at Turin, covering the\r\nsites of Padua, Ferrara, Bologna, Ravenna, Mantua, Cremona, Modena,\r\nParma, Piacenza, Pavia, Milan, and Novara. The industrious reader who\r\ngets out his Baedeker and looks up the shaded map of North Italy which\r\nforms its frontispiece will be rewarded for his pains by a better\r\ncomprehension of the district thus demarcated. The idle must be content\r\nto take my word for what follows. I pledge them my honour that I'll do\r\nmy best not to deceive their trustful innocence.\r\n\r\nIt may sound at first hearing a strange thing to say so, but the whole\r\nof that vast gulf, from Turin to Venice, has been entirely filled up\r\nwithin the human period by the mud sheet brought down by mountain\r\ntorrents from the Alps and the Apennines.\r\n\r\nA parallel elsewhere will make this easier of belief. You have looked\r\ndown, no doubt, from the garden of the hotel at Glion upon the lake of\r\nGeneva and the valley of the Rhone about Villeneuve and Aigle. If so,\r\nyou can understand from personal knowledge the first great stage in the\r\nmud-filling process; for you must have observed for yourself from that\r\ncommanding height that the lake once extended a great deal farther up\r\ncountry towards Bex and St. Maurice than it does at present. You can\r\nstill trace at once on either side the old mountainous banks,\r\ndescending into the plain as abruptly and unmistakably as they still\r\ndescend to the water's edge at Montreux and Vevey. But the silt of the\r\nRhone, brought down in great sheets of glacier mud (about which more\r\nanon) from the Furca and the Jungfrau and the Monte Rosa chain, has\r\ncompletely filled in the upper nine miles of the old lake basin with a\r\nlevel mass of fertile alluvium. There is no doubt about the fact: you\r\ncan see it for yourself with half an eye from that specular mount (to\r\ngive the Devil his due, I quote Milton's Satan): the mud lies even from\r\nbank to bank, raised only a few inches above the level of the lake, and\r\nas lacustrine in effect as the veriest geologist on earth could wish\r\nit. Indeed, the process of filling up still continues unabated at the\r\npresent day where the mud-laden Rhone enters the lake at Bouveret, to\r\nleave it again, clear and blue and beautiful, under the bridge at\r\nGeneva. The little delta which the river forms at its mouth shows the\r\nfresh mud in sheets gathering thick upon the bottom. Every day this new\r\nmud-bank pushes out farther and farther into the water, so that in\r\nprocess of time the whole basin will be filled in, and a level plain,\r\nlike that which now spreads from Bex and Aigle to Villeneuve, will\r\noccupy the entire bed from Montreux to Geneva.\r\n\r\nTurn mentally to the upper feeders of the Po itself, and you find the\r\nsame causes equally in action. You have stopped at Pallanza--Garoni's\r\nis so comfortable. Well, then, you know how every Alpine stream, as it\r\nflows, full-gorged, into the Italian lakes, is busily engaged in\r\nfilling them up as fast as ever it can with turbid mud from the\r\nuplands. The basins of Maggiore, Como, Lugano, and Garda are by origin\r\ndeep hollows scooped out long since during the Great Ice Age by the\r\npressure of huge glaciers that then spread far down into what is now\r\nthe poplar-clad plain of Lombardy. But ever since the ice cleared away,\r\nand the torrents began to rush headlong down the deep gorges of the Val\r\nLeventina and the Val Maggia, the mud has been hard at work, doing its\r\nlevel best to fill those great ice-worn bowls up again. Near the mouth\r\nof each main stream it has already succeeded in spreading a fan-shaped\r\ndelta. I will not insult you by asking you at the present time of day\r\nwhether you have been over the St. Gothard. In this age of _trains de\r\nluxe_ I know to my cost everybody has been everywhere. No chance of\r\npretending to superior knowledge about Japan or Honolulu; the tourist\r\nknows them. Very well, then; you must remember as you go past\r\nBellinzona--revolutionary little Bellinzona with its three castled\r\ncrags--you look down upon a vast mud flat by the mouth of the Ticino.\r\nPart of this mud flat is already solid land, but part is mere marsh or\r\nshifting quicksand. That is the first stage in the abolition of the\r\nlakes: the mud is annihilating them.\r\n\r\nMaggiore, indeed, least fortunate of the three main sheets, is being\r\nattacked by the insidious foe at three points simultaneously. At the\r\nupper end, the Ticino, that furious radical river, has filled in a\r\nlarge arm, which once spread far away up the valley towards Bellinzona.\r\nA little lower down, the Maggia near Locarno carries in a fresh\r\ncontribution of mud, which forms another fan-shaped delta, and\r\nstretches its ugly mass half across the lake, compelling the steamers\r\nto make a considerable detour eastward. This delta is rapidly extending\r\ninto the open water, and will in time fill in the whole remaining space\r\nfrom bank to bank, cutting off the upper end of the lake about Locarno\r\nfrom the main basin by a partition of lowland. This upper end will then\r\nform a separate minor lake, and the Ticino will flow out of it across\r\nthe intervening mud flat into the new and smaller Maggiore of our\r\ngreat-great-grandchildren. If you doubt it, look what the torrent of\r\nthe Toce, the third assailing battalion of the persistent mud force,\r\nhas already done in the neighbourhood of Pallanza. It has entirely cut\r\noff the upper end of the bay, that turns westward towards the Simplon,\r\nby a partition of mud; and this isolated upper bit forms now in our own\r\nday a separate lake, the Lago di Mergozzo, divided from the main sheet\r\nby an uninteresting mud bank. In process of time, no doubt, the whole\r\nof Maggiore will be similarly filled in by the advancing mud sheet, and\r\nwill become a level alluvial plain, surrounded by mountains, and\r\ngreatly admired by the astute Piedmontese cultivator.\r\n\r\nWhat is going on in Maggiore is going on equally in all the other\r\nsub-Alpine lakes of the Po valley. They are being gradually filled in,\r\nevery one of them, by the aggressive mud sheet. The upper end of\r\nLugano, for example, has already been cut off, as the Lago del Piano,\r\nfrom the main body; and the _piano_ itself, from which the little\r\nisolated tarn takes its name, is the alluvial mud fiat of a lateral\r\ntorrent--the mud flat, in fact, which the railway from Porlezza\r\ntraverses for twenty minutes before it begins its steep and picturesque\r\nclimb by successive zigzags over the mountains to Menaggio. Similarly\r\nthe influx of the Adda at the upper end of Como has cut off the Lago di\r\nMezzola from the main lake, and has formed the alluvial level that\r\nstretches so drearily all around Colico. Slowly the mud fiend\r\nencroaches everywhere on the lakes; and if you look for him when you\r\ngo, there you can see him actually at work every spring under your very\r\neyes, piling up fresh banks and deltas with alarming industry, and\r\npreparing (in a few hundred thousand years) to ruin the tourist trade\r\nof Cadenabbia and Bellagio.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from the lakes themselves to the Lombard plain at large,\r\nwhich is an immensely older and larger basin, we see traces of the same\r\naction on a vastly greater scale. A glance at the map will show the\r\nintelligent and ever courteous reader that the 'wandering Po'--I drop\r\ninto poetry after Goldsmith--flows much nearer the foot of the\r\nApennines than of the Alps in the course of its divagations, and seems\r\npurposely to bend away from the greater range of mountains. Why is\r\nthis, since everything in nature must needs have a reason? Well, it is\r\nbecause, when the mud first began to accumulate in the old Lombard bay\r\nof the Adriatic, there was no Po at all, whether wandering or\r\notherwise: the big river has slowly grown up in time by the union of\r\nthe lateral torrents that pour down from either side, as the growth of\r\nthe mud flat brought them gradually together. Careful study of a good\r\nmap will show how this has happened, especially if it has the plains\r\nand mountains distinctively tinted after the excellent German fashion.\r\nThe Ticino, the Adda, the Mincio, if you look at them close, reveal\r\nthemselves as tributaries of the Po, which once flowed separately into\r\nthe Lombard bay; the Adige, the Piave, the Tagliamento farther along\r\nthe coast, reveal themselves equally as tributaries of the future Po,\r\nwhen once the great river shall have filled up with its mud the space\r\nbetween Trieste and Venice, though for the moment they empty themselves\r\nand their store of detritus into the open Adriatic.\r\n\r\nFix your eyes for a moment on Venetia proper, and you will see how this\r\nhas all happened and is still happening. Each mountain torrent that\r\nleaps from the Tyrolese Alps bring down in its lap a rich mass of mud,\r\nwhich has gradually spread over a strip of sea some forty or fifty\r\nmiles wide, from the base of the mountains to the modern coast-line of\r\nthe province. Near the sea--or, in other words, at the temporary\r\noutlet--it forms banks and lagoons, of which those about Venice are the\r\nbest known to tourists, though the least characteristic. For miles and\r\nmiles between Venice and Trieste the shifting north shore of the\r\nAdriatic consists of nothing but such accumulating mud banks. Year\r\nafter year they push farther seaward, and year after year fresh islets\r\nand shoals grow out into the waves beyond the temporary deltas. In\r\ntime, therefore, the gathering mud banks of these Alpine torrents must\r\njoin the greater mud bank that runs rapidly seaward at the delta of the\r\nPo. As soon as they do so the rivers must rush together, and what was\r\nonce an independent stream, emptying itself into the Adriatic, must\r\nbecome a tributary of the Po, helping to swell the waters of that great\r\nunited river. The Adige has now just reached this state: its delta is\r\ncontinuous with the delta of the Po, and their branches interosculate.\r\nThe Mincio and the Adda reached it ages since: the Piave and the\r\nLivenia will not reach it for ages. In Roman days Hatria was still on\r\nthe sea: it is now some fifteen miles inland.\r\n\r\nFrom all this you can gather why the existing Po flows far from the\r\nAlps and nearer the base of the Apennines. The Alpine streams in far\r\ndistant days brought down relatively large floods of glacial mud;\r\nformed relatively large deltas in the old Lombard bay; filled up with\r\nrelative rapidity their larger half of the basin. The Apennines, less\r\nlofty, and free from glaciers, sent down shorter and smaller torrents,\r\nladen with far less mud, and capable therefore of doing but little\r\nalluvial work for the filling in of the future Lombardy. So the river\r\nwas pushed southward by the Alpine deposits of the northern streams,\r\nleaving the great plains of Cisalpine Gaul spread away to the north of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd this land-making action is ceaseless and continuous. About Venice,\r\nChioggia, Maestra, Comacchio, the delta of the Po is still spreading\r\nseaward. In the course of ages--if nothing unforeseen occurs meanwhile\r\nto prevent it--the Alpine mud will have filled in the entire Adriatic;\r\nand the Ionian Isles will spring like isolated mountain ridges from the\r\nAdriatic plain, as the Euganean hills--those 'mountains Euganean' where\r\nShelley 'stood listening to the pæan with which the legioned rocks did\r\nhail the sun's uprise majestical'--spring in our own time from the dead\r\nlevel of Lombardy. Once they in turn were the Euganean islands, and\r\neven now to the trained eye of the historical observer they stand up\r\nisland-like from the vast green plain that spreads flat around them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it seems to you a rather large order to be asked to believe\r\nthat Lombardy and Venetia are nothing more than an outspread sheet of\r\ndeep Alpine mud. Well, there is nothing so good for incredulity, don't\r\nyou know, as capping the climax. If a man will not swallow an inch of\r\nfact, the best remedy is to make him gulp down an ell of it. And,\r\nindeed, the Lombard plain is but an insignificant mud flat compared\r\nwith the vast alluvial plains of Asiatic and American rivers. The\r\nalluvium of the Euphrates, of the Mississippi, of the Hoang Ho, of the\r\nAmazons would take in many Lombardies and half-a-dozen Venetias without\r\nnoticing the addition. But I will insist upon only one example--the\r\nrivers of India, which have formed the gigantic deep mud flat of the\r\nGanges and the Jumna, one of the very biggest on earth, and that\r\nbecause the Himalayas are the highest and newest mountain chain exposed\r\nto denudation. For, as we saw foreshadowed in the case of the Alps and\r\nApennines, the bigger the mountains on which we can draw the greater\r\nthe resulting mass of alluvium. The Rocky Mountains give rise to the\r\nMissouri (which is the real Mississippi); the Andes give rise to\r\nAmazons and the La Plata; the Himalayas give rise to the Ganges and the\r\nIndus. Great mountain, great river, great resulting mud sheet.\r\n\r\nAt a very remote period, so long ago that we cannot reduce it to any\r\ncommon measure with our modern chronology, the southern table-land of\r\nIndia--the Deccan, as we call it--formed a great island like Australia,\r\nseparated from the continent of Asia by a broad arm of the sea which\r\noccupied what is now the great plain of Bengal, the North-West, and the\r\nPunjaub. This ancient sea washed the foot of the Himalayas, and spread\r\nsouth thence for 600 miles to the base of the Vindhyas. But the\r\nHimalayas are high and clad with gigantic glaciers. Much ice grinds\r\nmuch mud on those snow-capped summits. The rivers that flowed from the\r\nRoof of the World carried down vast sheets of alluvium, which formed\r\nfans at their mouths, like the cones still deposited on a far smaller\r\nscale in the Lake of Geneva by little lateral torrents. Gradually the\r\nsilt thus brought down accumulated on either side, till the rivers ran\r\ntogether into two great systems--one westward--the Indus, with its four\r\ngreat tributaries, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravee, Sutlej; one eastward, the\r\nGanges, reinforced lower down by the sister streams of the Jumna and\r\nthe Brahmapootra. The colossal accumulation of silt thus produced\r\nfilled up at last all the great arm of the sea between the two mountain\r\nchains, and joined the Deccan by slow degrees to the continent of Asia.\r\nIt is still engaged in filling up the Bay of Bengal on one side by the\r\ndetritus of the Ganges, and the Arabian Sea on the other by the\r\nsand-banks of the Indus.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, no doubt, the silt of the Thames, the Humber, the\r\nRhine, and the Meuse tend slowly (bar accidents) to fill up the North\r\nSea, and anticipate Sir Edward Watkin by throwing a land bridge across\r\nthe English Channel. If ever that should happen, then history will have\r\nrepeated itself, for it is just so that the Deccan was joined to the\r\nmainland of Asia.\r\n\r\nOne question more. Whence comes the mud? The answer is, Mainly from the\r\ndetritus of the mountains. There it has two origins. Part of it is\r\nglacial, part of it is leaf-mould. In order to feel we have really got\r\nto the very bottom of the mud problem--and we are nothing if not\r\nthorough--we must examine in brief these two separate origins.\r\n\r\nThe glacier mud is of a very simple nature. It is disintegrated rock,\r\nworn small by the enormous millstone of ice that rolls slowly over the\r\nbed, and deposited in part as 'terminal moraine' near the summer\r\nmelting-point. It is the quantity of mud thus produced, and borne down\r\nby mountain torrents, that makes the alluvial plains collect so quickly\r\nat their base. The mud flats of the world are in large part the wear\r\nand tear of the eternal hills under the planing action of the eternal\r\nglaciers.\r\n\r\nBut let us be just to our friends. A large part is also due to the\r\nindustrious earth-worm, whose place in nature Darwin first taught us to\r\nestimate at its proper worth. For there is much detritus and much\r\nfirst-rate soil even on hills not covered by glaciers. Some of this\r\ntakes its origin, it is true, from disintegration by wind or rain, but\r\nmuch more is caused by the earth-worm in person. That friend of\r\nhumanity, so little recognized in his true light, has a habit of\r\ndrawing down leaves into his subterranean nest, and there eating them\r\nup, so as to convert their remains into vegetable mould in the form of\r\nworm-casts. This mould, the most precious of soils, gets dissolved\r\nagain by the rain, and carried off in solution by the streams to the\r\nsea or the lowlands, where it helps to form the future cultivable area.\r\nAt the same time the earthworms secrete an acid, which acts upon the\r\nbare surface of rock beneath, and helps to disintegrate it in\r\npreparation for plant life in unfavourable places. It is probable that\r\nwe owe almost more on the whole to these unknown but conscientious and\r\nindustrious annelids than even to those 'mills of God' the glaciers, of\r\nwhich the American poet justly observes that though they grind slowly,\r\nyet they grind exceedingly small.\r\n\r\nIn the last resort, then, it is mainly on mud that the life of humanity\r\nin all countries bases itself. Every great plain is the alluvial\r\ndeposit of a great river, ultimately derived from a great mountain\r\nchain. The substance consists as a rule of the débris of torrents,\r\nwhich is often infertile, owing to its stoniness and its purely mineral\r\ncharacter; but wherever it has lain long enough to be covered by\r\nearth-worms with a deep black layer of vegetable mould, there the\r\nresulting soil shows the surprising fruitfulness one gets (for example)\r\nin Lombardy, where twelve crops a year are sometimes taken from the\r\nmeadows. Everywhere and always the amount and depth of the mud is the\r\nmeasure of possible fertility; and even where, as in the Great American\r\nDesert, want of water converts alluvial plains into arid stretches of\r\nsand-waste, the wilderness can be made to blossom like the rose in a\r\nvery few years by artificial irrigation. The diversion of the Arkansas\r\nRiver has spread plenty over a vast sage scrub; the finest crops in the\r\nworld are now raised over a tract of country which was once the terror\r\nof the traveller across the wild west of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE GREENWOOD TREE.\r\n\r\nIt is a common, not to say a vulgar error, to believe that trees and\r\nplants grow out of the ground. And of course, having thus begun by\r\ncalling it bad names, I will not for a moment insult the intelligence\r\nof my readers by supposing them to share so foolish a delusion. I beg\r\nto state from the outset that I write this article entirely for the\r\nbenefit of Other People. You and I, O proverbially Candid and\r\nIntelligent One, it need hardly be said, are better informed. But Other\r\nPeople fall into such ridiculous blunders that it is just as well to\r\nput them on their guard beforehand against the insidious advance of\r\nfalse opinions. I have known otherwise good and estimable men, indeed,\r\nwho for lack of sound early teaching on this point went to their graves\r\nwith a confirmed belief in the terrestrial origin of all earthly\r\nvegetation. They were probably victims of what the Church in its\r\nsuccinct way describes and denounces as Invincible Ignorance.\r\n\r\nNow, the reason why these deluded creatures supposed trees to grow out\r\nof the ground, instead of out of the air, is probably only because they\r\nsaw their roots there.\r\n\r\nOf course, when people see a wallflower rooted in the clefts of some\r\nold church tower, they don't jump at once to the inane conclusion that\r\nit is made of rock--that it derives its nourishment direct from the\r\nsolid limestone; nor when they observe a barnacle hanging by its sucker\r\nto a ship's hull, do they imagine it to draw up its food incontinently\r\nfrom the copper bottom. But when they see that familiar pride of our\r\ncountry, a British oak, with its great underground buttresses spreading\r\nabroad through the soil in every direction, they infer at once that the\r\nbuttresses are there, not--as is really the case--to support it and\r\nuphold it, but to drink in nutriment from the earth beneath, which is\r\njust about as capable of producing oak-wood as the copper plate on the\r\nship's hull is capable of producing the flesh of a barnacle. Sundry\r\nfamiliar facts about manuring and watering, to which I will return\r\nlater on, give a certain colour of reasonableness, it is true, to this\r\nmistaken inference. But how mistaken it really is for all that, a\r\nsingle and very familiar little experiment will easily show one.\r\n\r\nCut down that British oak with your Gladstonian axe; lop him of his\r\nbranches; divide him into logs; pile him up into a pyramid; put a match\r\nto his base; in short, make a bonfire of him; and what becomes of\r\nrobust majesty? He is reduced to ashes, you say. Ah, yes, but what\r\nproportion of him? Conduct your experiment carefully on a small scale;\r\ndry your wood well, and weigh it before burning; weigh your ash\r\nafterwards, and what will you find? Why, that the solid matter which\r\nremains after the burning is a mere infinitesimal fraction of the total\r\nweight: the greater part has gone off into the air, from whence it\r\ncame, as carbonic acid. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes; but air to air,\r\ntoo, is the rule of nature.\r\n\r\nIt may sound startling--to Other People, I mean--but the simple truth\r\nremains, that trees and plants grow out of the atmosphere, not out of\r\nthe ground. They are, in fact, solidified air; or to be more strictly\r\ncorrect, solidified gas--carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nTake an ordinary soda-water syphon, with or without a wine-glassful of\r\nbrandy, and empty it till only a few drops remain in the bottom. Then\r\nthe bottle is full of gas; and that gas, which will rush out with a\r\nspurt when you press the knob, is the stuff that plants eat--the raw\r\nmaterial of life, both animal and vegetable. The tree grows and lives\r\nby taking in the carbonic acid from the air, and solidifying its\r\ncarbon; the animal grows and lives by taking the solidified carbon from\r\nthe plant, and converting it once more into carbonic acid. That, in its\r\nideally simple form, is the Iliad in a nutshell, the core and kernel of\r\nbiology. The whole cycle of life is one eternal see-saw. First the\r\nplant collects its carbon compounds from the air in the oxidized state;\r\nit deoxidizes and rebuilds them: and then the animal proceeds to burn\r\nthem up by slow combustion within his own body, and to turn them loose\r\nupon the air, once more oxidized. After which the plant starts again on\r\nthe same round as before, and the animal also recommences _da capo_.\r\nAnd so on _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nBut the point which I want particularly to emphasize here is just this:\r\nthat trees and plants don't grow out of the ground at all, as most\r\npeople do vainly talk, but directly out of the air; and that when they\r\ndie or get consumed, they return once more to the atmosphere from which\r\nthey were taken. Trees undeniably eat carbon.\r\n\r\nOf course, therefore, all the ordinary unscientific conceptions of how\r\nplants feed are absolutely erroneous. Vegetable physiology, indeed, got\r\nbeyond these conceptions a good hundred years ago. But it usually takes\r\na hundred years for the world at large to make up its leeway. Trees\r\ndon't suck up their nutriment by the roots, they don't derive their\r\nfood from the soil, they don't need to be fed, like babies through a\r\ntube, with terrestrial solids. The solitary instance of an orchid hung\r\nup by a string in a conservatory on a piece of bark, ought to be\r\nsufficient at once to dispel for ever this strange illusion--if people\r\never thought; but of course they don't think--I mean Other People. The\r\ntrue mouths and stomachs of plants are not to be found in the roots,\r\nbut in the green leaves; their true food is not sucked up from the\r\nsoil, but is inhaled through tiny channels from the air; the mass of\r\ntheir material is carbon, as we can all see visibly to the naked eye\r\nwhen a log of wood is reduced to charcoal: and that carbon the leaves\r\nthemselves drink in, by a thousand small green mouths, from the\r\natmosphere around them.\r\n\r\nBut how about the juice, the sap, the qualities of the soil, the manure\r\nrequired? is the incredulous cry of Other People. What is the use of\r\nthe roots, and especially of the rootlets, if they are not the mouths\r\nand supply-tubes of the plants? Well, I plainly perceive I can get 'no\r\nforrarder,' like the farmer with his claret, till I've answered that\r\nquestion, provisionally at least; so I will say here at once, without\r\nfurther ado--the plant requires drink as well as food, and the roots\r\nare the mouths that supply it with water. They also suck up a few other\r\nthings as well, which are necessary indeed, but far from forming the\r\nbulk of the nutriment. Many plants, however, don't need any roots at\r\nall, while none can get on without leaves as mouths and stomachs. That\r\nis to say, no true plantlike plants, for some parasitic plants are\r\npractically, to all intents and purposes, animals. To put it briefly,\r\nevery plant has one set of aerial mouths to suck in carbon, and many\r\nplants have another set of subterranean mouths as well, to suck up\r\nwater and mineral constituents.\r\n\r\nHave you ever grown mustard and cress in the window on a piece of\r\nflannel? If so, that's a capital practical example of the comparative\r\nunimportance of soil, except as a means of supplying moisture. You put\r\nyour flannel in a soup-plate by the dining-room window; you keep it\r\nwell wet, and you lay the seeds of the cress on top of it. The young\r\nplants, being supplied with water by their roots, and with carbon by\r\nthe air around, have all the little they need below, and grow and\r\nthrive in these conditions wonderfully. But if you were to cover them\r\nup with an air-tight glass case, so as to exclude fresh air, they'd\r\nshrivel up at once for want of carbon, which is their solid food, as\r\nwater is their liquid.\r\n\r\nThe way the plant really eats is little known to gardeners, but very\r\ninteresting. All over the lower surface of the green leaf lie scattered\r\ndozens of tiny mouths or apertures, each of them guarded by two small\r\npursed-up lips which have a ridiculously human appearance when seen\r\nthrough a simple microscope. When the conditions of air and moisture\r\nare favourable, these lips open visible to admit gases; and then the\r\ntiny mouths suck in carbonic acid in abundance from the air around\r\nthen. A series of pipes conveys the gaseous food thus supplied to the\r\nupper surface of the leaf, where the sunlight falls full upon it. Now,\r\nthe cells of the leaf contain a peculiar green digestive material,\r\nwhich I regret to say has no simpler or more cheerful name than\r\nchlorophyll; and where the sunlight plays upon this mysterious\r\nchlorophyll, it severs the oxygen from the carbon in the carbonic acid,\r\nturns the free gas loose upon the atmosphere once more through the tiny\r\nmouths, and retains the severed carbon intact in its own tissues. That\r\nis the whole process of feeding in plants: they eat carbonic acid,\r\ndigest it in their leaves, get rid of the oxygen with which it was\r\nformerly combined, and keep the carbon stored up for their own\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nLife as a whole depends entirely upon this property of chlorophyll; for\r\nevery atom of organic matter in your body or mine was originally so\r\nmanufactured by sunlight in the leaves of some plant from which,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, we derive it.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, in order to make up the various substances which compose\r\ntheir tissues--to build up their wood, their leaves, their fruits,\r\ntheir blossoms--plants require hydrogen, nitrogen, and even small\r\nquantities of oxygen as well; but these various materials are\r\nsufficiently supplied in the water which is taken up by the roots, and\r\nthey really contribute very little indeed to the bulk of the tree,\r\nwhich consists for the most part of almost pure carbon. If you were to\r\ntake a thoroughly dry piece of wood, and then drive off from it by heat\r\nthese extraneous matters, you would find that the remainder, the pure\r\ncharcoal, formed the bulk of the weight, the rest being for the most\r\npart very light and gaseous. Briefly put, plants are mostly carbon and\r\nwater, and the carbon which forms their solid part is extracted direct\r\nfrom the air around them.\r\n\r\nHow does it come about then that a careless world in general, and more\r\nespecially the happy-go-lucky race of gardeners and farmers in\r\nparticular, who have to deal so much with plants in their practical\r\naspect, always attach so great importance to root, soil, manure,\r\nminerals, and so little to the real gaseous food stuff of which their\r\ncrops are, in fact, composed? Why does Hodge, who is so strong on grain\r\nand guano, know absolutely nothing about carbonic acid? That seems at\r\nfirst sight a difficult question to meet. But I think we can meet it\r\nwith a simple analogy.\r\n\r\nOxygen is an absolute necessary of human life. Even food itself is\r\nhardly so important an element in our daily existence; for Succi, Dr.\r\nTanner, the prophet Elijah, and other adventurous souls too numerous to\r\nmention, have abundantly shown us that a man can do without food\r\naltogether for forty days at a stretch, while he can't do without\r\noxygen for a single minute. Cut off his supply of that life-supporting\r\ngas, choke him, or suffocate him, or place him in an atmosphere of pure\r\ncarbonic acid, or hold his head in a bucket of water, and he dies at\r\nonce. Yet, except in mines or submarine tunnels, nobody ever takes into\r\naccount practically this most important factor in human and animal\r\nlife. We toil for bread, but we ignore the supply of oxygen. And why?\r\nSimply because oxygen is universally diffused everywhere. It costs\r\nnothing. Only in the Black Hole of Calcutta or in a broken tunnel shaft\r\ndo men ever begin to find themselves practically short of that\r\nlife-sustaining gas, and then they know the want of it far sooner and\r\nfar more sharply than they know the want of food on a shipwreck raft,\r\nor the want of water in the thirsty desert. Yet antiquity never even\r\nheard of oxygen. A prime necessary of life passed unnoticed for ages in\r\nhuman history, only because there was abundance of it to be had\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nNow it isn't quite the same, I admit, with the carbonaceous food of\r\nplants. Carbonic acid isn't quite so universally distributed as oxygen,\r\nnor can every plant always get as much as it wants of it. I shall show\r\nby-and-by that a real struggle for food takes place between plants,\r\nexactly as it takes place between animals; and that certain plants,\r\nlike Oliver Twist in the workhouse, never practically get enough to\r\neat. Still, carbonic acid is present in very large quantities in the\r\nair in most situations, and is freely brought by the wind to all the\r\nopen spaces which alone man uses for his crops and his gardening. The\r\nmost important element in the food of plants is thus in effect almost\r\neverywhere available, especially from the point of view of the mere\r\npractical everyday human agriculturist. The wind that bloweth where it\r\nlisteth brings fresh supplies of carbon on its wings with every breeze\r\nto the mouths and throats of the greedy and eager plants that long to\r\nabsorb it.\r\n\r\nIt is quite otherwise, however, with the soil and its constituents.\r\nLand, we all know--or if we don't, it isn't the fault of Mr. George and\r\nMr. A.R. Wallace--land is 'naturally limited in quantity.' Every plant\r\ntherefore struggles for a foothold in the soil far more fiercely and\r\nfar more tenaciously than it struggles for its share in the free air of\r\nheaven. Your plant is a land-grabber of Rob Roy proclivities; it\r\nbelieves in a fair fight and no favour. A sufficient supply of food it\r\nalmost takes for granted, if only it can once gain a sufficient\r\nground-space. But other plants are competing with it, tooth and nail\r\n(if plants may be permitted by courtesy those metaphorical adjuncts),\r\nfor their share of the soil, like crofters or socialists; every spare\r\ninch of earth is permeated and pervaded with matted fibres; and each is\r\nstriving to withdraw from each the small modicum of moisture, mineral\r\nmatter, and manure for which all alike are eagerly battling.\r\n\r\nNow, what the plant wants from the soil is three things. First and\r\nforemost it wants support; like all the rest of us it must have its\r\n_pou sto_, its _pied-à-terre_, its _locus standi_. It can't hang aloft,\r\nlike Mahomet's coffin, miraculously suspended on an aerial perch\r\nbetween earth and heaven. Secondly, it wants water, and this it can\r\ntake in, as a rule, only or mainly by means of the rootlets, though\r\nthere are some peculiar plants which grow (not parasitically) on the\r\nbranches of trees, and absorb all the moisture they need by pores on\r\ntheir surface. And thirdly, it wants small quantities of nitrogenous\r\nmatter--in the simpler language of everyday life called manure--as well\r\nas of mineral matter--in the simpler language of everyday life called\r\nashes. It is mainly the first of these three, support, that the farmer\r\nthinks of when he calculates crops and acreage; for the second, he\r\ndepends upon rainfall or irrigation; but the third, manure, he can\r\nsupply artificially; and as manure makes a great deal of incidental\r\ndifference to some of his crops, especially corn--which requires\r\nabundant phosphates--he is apt to over-estimate vastly its importance\r\nfrom a theoretical point of view.\r\n\r\nBesides, look at it in another light. Over large areas together, the\r\nconditions of air, climate, and rainfall are practically identical. But\r\nsoil differs greatly from place to place. Here it's black; there it's\r\nyellow; here it's rich loam; there it's boggy mould or sandy gravel.\r\nAnd some soils are better adapted to growing certain plants than\r\nothers. Rich lowlands and oolites suit the cereals; red marl produces\r\nwonderful grazing grass; bare uplands are best for gorse and heather.\r\nHence everything favours for the practical man the mistaken idea that\r\nplants and trees grow mainly out of the soil. His own eyes tell him so;\r\nhe sees them growing, he sees the visible result undeniable before his\r\nface; while the real act of feeding off the carbon in the air is wholly\r\nunknown to him, being realizable only by the aid of the microscope,\r\naided by the most delicate and difficult chemical analysis.\r\n\r\nNevertheless French chemists have amply proved by actual experiment\r\nthat plants can grow and produce excellent results without any aid from\r\nthe soil at all. You have only to suspend the seeds freely in the air\r\nby a string, and supply the rootlets of the sprouting seedlings with a\r\nlittle water, containing in solution small quantities of manure-stuffs,\r\nand the plants will grow as well as on their native heath, or even\r\nbetter. Indeed, nature has tried the same experiment on a larger scale\r\nin many cases, as with the cliff-side plants that root themselves in\r\nthe naked clefts of granite rocks; the tropical orchids that fasten\r\nlightly on the bark of huge forest trees; and the mosses that spread\r\neven over the bare face of hard brick walls, with scarcely a chink or\r\ncranny in which to fasten their minute rootlets. The insect-eating\r\nplants are also interesting examples in their way of the curious means\r\nwhich nature takes for keeping up the manure supply under trying\r\ncircumstances. These uncanny things are all denizens of loose, peaty\r\nsoil, where they can root themselves sufficiently for purposes of\r\nfoothold and drink, but where the water rapidly washes away all animal\r\nmatter. Under such conditions the cunning sundews and the ruthless\r\npitcher-plants set deceptive honey traps for unsuspecting insects,\r\nwhich they catch and kill, absorbing and using up the protoplasmic\r\ncontents of their bodies, by way of manure, to supply their quota of\r\nnitrogenous material.\r\n\r\nIt is the literal fact, then, that plants really eat and live off\r\ncarbon, just as truly as sheep eat grass or lions eat antelopes; and\r\nthat the green leaves are the mouths and stomachs with which they eat\r\nand digest it. From this it naturally results that the growth and\r\nspread of the leaves must largely depend upon the supply of carbon, as\r\nthe growth and fatness of sheep depends upon the supply of pasturage.\r\nUnder most circumstances, to be sure, there is carbon enough and to\r\nspare lying about loose for every one of them; but conditions do now\r\nand again occur where we can clearly see the importance of the carbon\r\nsupply. Water, for example, contains practically much less carbonic\r\nacid than atmospheric air, especially when the water is stagnant, and\r\ntherefore not supplied fresh to the plant from moment to moment. As a\r\nconsequence, almost all water-plants have submerged leaves very narrow\r\nand waving, while floating plants, like the water-lilies, have them\r\nlarge and round, owing to the absence of competition from other kinds\r\nabout, which enables them to spread freely in every direction from the\r\ncentral stalk. Moreover, these leaves, lolling on the water as they do,\r\nhave their mouths on the upper instead of the under surface. But the\r\nmost remarkable fact of all is that many water plants have two entirely\r\ndifferent types of leaves, one submerged and hair-like, the other\r\nfloating and broad or circular. Our own English water-crowfoot, for\r\nexample, has the leaves that spring from its stem, below the surface,\r\ndivided into endless long waving filaments, which look about in the\r\nwater for the stray particles of carbon; but the moment it reaches the\r\ntop of its native pond the foliage expands at once into broad lily-like\r\nlobes, that recline on the water like oriental beauties, and absorb\r\ncarbon from the air to their heart's content, The one type may be\r\nlikened to gills, that similarly catch the dissolved oxygen diffused in\r\nwater; the other type may be likened to lungs, that drink in the free\r\nand open air of heaven.\r\n\r\nEqually important to the plant, however, with the supply of carbonic\r\nacid, is the supply of sunshine by whose aid to digest it. The carbon\r\nalone is no good to the tree if it can't get something which will\r\nseparate it from the oxygen, locked in close embrace with it. That\r\nthing is sunshine. There is nothing, therefore, for which herbs, trees,\r\nand shrubs compete more eagerly than for their fair share of solar\r\nenergy. In their anxiety for this they jostle one another down most\r\nmercilessly, in the native condition, grasses struggling up with their\r\nhollow stems above the prone low herbs, shrubs overtopping the grasses\r\nin turn, and trees once more killing out the overshadowed undershrubs.\r\nOne must remember that wherever nature has free play, instead of being\r\ncontrolled by the hand of man, dense forest covers every acre of ground\r\nwhere the soil is deep enough; gorse, whins, and heather, or their\r\nequivalents grow wherever the forest fails; and herbs can only hold\r\ntheir own in the rare intervals where these domineering lords of the\r\nvegetable creation can find no foothold. Meadows or prairies occur\r\nnowhere in nature, except in places where the liability to destructive\r\nfires over wide areas together crushes out forest trees, or else where\r\ngoats, bison, deer, and other large herbivores browse them ceaselessly\r\ndown in the stage of seedlings. Competition for sunlight is thus even\r\nkeener perhaps than competition for foodstuffs. Alike on trees, shrubs,\r\nand herbs, accordingly the arrangement of the leaves is always exactly\r\ncalculated so as to allow the largest possible horizontal surface, and\r\nthe greatest exposure of the blade to the open sunshine. In trees this\r\narrangement can often be very well observed, all the leaves being\r\nplaced at the extremities of the branches, and forming a great\r\ndome-shaped or umbrella-shaped mass, every part of which stands an even\r\nchance of catching its fair share of carbonic acid and solar energy.\r\n\r\nThe shapes of the leaves themselves are also largely due to the same\r\ncause, every leaf being so designed in form and outline as to interfere\r\nas little as possible with the other leaves on the same stem, as\r\nregards supply both of light and of carbonaceous foodstuffs. It is only\r\nin rare cases, like that of the water-lily, that perfectly round leaves\r\noccur, because the conditions are seldom equal all round, and the\r\nincidence of light and the supply of carbon are seldom unlimited. But\r\nwherever leaves rise free and solitary into the air, without mutual\r\ninterference, they are always circular, as may be well seen in the\r\ncommon nasturtium and the English pennywort. On the other hand, among\r\ndense hedgerows and thickets, where the silent, invisible struggle for\r\nlife is fierce indeed, and where sunlight and carbonic acid are\r\nintercepted by a thousand competing mouths and arms, the prevailing\r\ntypes of leaf are extremely cut up and minutely subdivided into small\r\nlace-like fragments. The plant in such cases can't afford material to\r\nfill up the interstices between the veins and ribs which determine its\r\nunderlying architectural structure. Often indeed species which grow\r\nunder these hard conditions produce leaves which are, as it were, but\r\nskeleton representatives of their large and well filled-out compeers in\r\nthe open meadows.\r\n\r\nIt is only by bearing vividly in mind this ceaseless and noiseless\r\nstruggle between plants for their gaseous food and the sunshine which\r\nenables them to digest it that we can ever fully understand the varying\r\nforms and habits of the vegetable kingdom. To most people, no doubt, it\r\nsounds like pure metaphor to talk of an internecine struggle between\r\nrooted beings which cannot budge one inch from their places, nor fight\r\nwith horns, hoofs, or teeth, nor devour one another bodily, nor tread\r\none another down with ruthless footsteps. But that is only because we\r\nhabitually forget that competition is just as really a struggle for\r\nlife as open warfare. The men who try against one another for a\r\nclerkship in the City, or a post in a gang of builder's workmen, are\r\njust as surely taking away bread and butter out of their fellows'\r\nmouths for their own advantage, as if they fought for it openly with\r\nfists or six-shooters. The white man who encloses the hunting grounds\r\nof the Indian, and plants them with corn, is just as surely dooming\r\nthat Indian to death as if he scalped or tomahawked him. And so too\r\nwith the unconscious warfare of plants. The daisy or the plantain that\r\nspreads its rosette of leaves flat against the ground is just as truly\r\nmonopolizing a definite space of land as the noble owner of a Highland\r\ndeer forest. No blade of grass can spring beneath the shadow of those\r\ntightly pressed little mats of foliage; no fragment of carbon, no ray\r\nof sunshine can ever penetrate below that close fence of living\r\ngreenstuff.\r\n\r\nPlants, in fact, compete with one another all round for everything they\r\nstand in need of. They compete for their food--carbonic acid. They\r\ncompete for their energy--their fair share of sunlight. They compete\r\nfor water, and their foothold in the soil. They compete for the favours\r\nof the insects that fertilize their flowers. They compete for the good\r\nservices of the birds or mammals that disseminate their seeds in proper\r\nspots for germination. And how real this competition is we can see in a\r\nmoment, if we think of the difficulties of human cultivation. There,\r\nweeds are always battling manfully with our crops or our flowers for\r\nmastery over the field or garden. We are obliged to root up with\r\nceaseless toil these intrusive competitors, if we wish to enjoy the\r\nkindly fruits of the earth in due season. When we leave a garden to\r\nitself for a few short years, we realize at once what effect the\r\ncompetition of hardy natives has upon our carefully tended and unstable\r\nexotics. In a very brief time the dahlias and phloxes and lilies have\r\nall disappeared, and in their place the coarse-growing docks and\r\nnettles and thistles have raised their heads aloft to monopolize air\r\nand space and sunshine.\r\n\r\nExactly the same struggle is always taking place in the fields and\r\nwoods and moors around us, and especially in the spots made over to\r\npure nature. There, the greenwood tree raises its huge umbrella of\r\nfoliage to the skies, and allows hardly a ray of sunlight to struggle\r\nthrough to the low woodland vegetation of orchid or wintergreen\r\nunderneath. Where the soil is not deep enough for trees to root\r\nsecurely, bushes and heathers overgrow the ground, and compete with\r\ntheir bell-shaped blossoms for the coveted favour of bees and\r\nbutterflies. And in open glades, where for some reason or other the\r\nforest fails, tall grasses and other aspiring herbs run up apace\r\ntowards the free air of heaven. Elsewhere, creepers struggle up to the\r\nsun over the stems and branches of stronger bushes or trees, which they\r\noften choke and starve by monopolizing at last all the available carbon\r\nand sunlight. And so throughout; the struggle for life goes on just as\r\nceaselessly and truly among these unconscious combatants as among the\r\nlions and tigers of the tropical jungle, or among the human serfs of\r\nthe overstocked market.\r\n\r\nAn ounce of example, they say, is worth a pound of precept. So a single\r\nconcrete case of a fierce vegetable campaign now actually in progress\r\nover all Northern Europe may help to make my meaning a trifle clearer.\r\nTill very lately the forests of the north were largely composed in\r\nplaces of the light and airy silver birches. But with the gradual\r\namelioration of the climate of our continent, which has been going on\r\nfor several centuries, the beech, a more southern type of tree, has\r\nbegun to spread slowly though surely northward. Now, beeches are greedy\r\ntrees, of very dense and compact foliage; nothing else can grow beneath\r\ntheir thick shade, where once they have gained a foothold; and the\r\nseedlings of the silver birch stand no chance at all in the struggle\r\nfor life against the serried leaves of their formidable rivals. The\r\nbeech literally eats them out of house and home; and the consequence is\r\nthat the thick and ruthless southern tree is at this very moment\r\ngradually superseding over vast tracts of country its more graceful and\r\nbeautiful, but far less voracious competitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FISH AS FATHERS.\r\n\r\nComparatively little is known as yet, even in this age of publicity,\r\nabout the domestic arrangements and private life of fishes. Not that\r\nthe creatures themselves shun the wiles of the interviewer, or are at\r\nall shy and retiring, as a matter of delicacy, about their family\r\naffairs; on the contrary, they display a striking lack of reticence in\r\ntheir native element, and are so far from pushing parental affection to\r\na quixotic extreme that many of them, like the common rabbit\r\nimmortalised by Mr. Squeers, 'frequently devour their own offspring.'\r\nBut nature herself opposes certain obvious obstacles to the pursuit of\r\nknowledge in the great deep, which render it difficult for the ardent\r\nnaturalist, however much he may be so disposed, to carry on his\r\nobservations with the same facility as in the case of birds and\r\nquadrupeds. You can't drop in upon most fish, casually, in their own\r\nhomes; and when you confine them in aquariums, where your opportunities\r\nof watching them through a sheet of plate-glass are considerably\r\ngreater, most of the captives get huffy under the narrow restrictions\r\nof their prison life, and obstinately refuse to rear a brood of\r\nhereditary helots for the mere gratification of your scientific\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nStill, by hook and by crook (especially the former), by observation\r\nhere and experiment there, naturalists in the end have managed to piece\r\ntogether a considerable mass of curious and interesting information of\r\nan out-of-the-way sort about the domestic habits and manners of sundry\r\npiscine races. And, indeed, the morals of fish are far more varied and\r\ndivergent than the uniform nature of the world they inhabit might lead\r\nan _à priori_ philosopher to imagine. To the eye of the mere casual\r\nobserver every fish would seem at first sight to be a mere fish, and to\r\ndiffer but little in sentiments and ethical culture from all the rest\r\nof his remote cousins. But when one comes to look closer at their\r\ncharacter and antecedents, it becomes evident at once that there is a\r\ndeal of unsuspected originality and caprice about sharks and flat-fish.\r\nInstead of conforming throughout to a single plan, as the young, the\r\ngay, the giddy, and the thoughtless are too prone to conclude, fish are\r\nin reality as various and variable in their mode of life as any other\r\ngreat group in the animal kingdom. Monogamy and polygamy, socialism and\r\nindividualism, the patriarchal and matriarchal types of government, the\r\noviparous and viviparous methods of reproduction, perhaps even the\r\ndissidence of dissent and esoteric Buddhism, all alike are well\r\nrepresented in one family or another of this extremely eclectic and\r\nphilosophically unprejudiced class of animals.\r\n\r\nIf you want a perfect model of domestic virtue, for example, where can\r\nyou find it in higher perfection than in that exemplary and devoted\r\nfather, the common great pipe-fish of the North Atlantic and the\r\nBritish Seas? This high-principled lophobranch is so careful of its\r\ncallow and helpless young that it carries about the unhatched eggs with\r\nhim under his own tail, in what scientific ichthyologists pleasantly\r\ndescribe as a subcaudal pouch or cutaneous receptacle. There they hatch\r\nout in perfect security, free from the dangers that beset the spawn and\r\nfry of so many other less tender-hearted kinds; and as soon as the\r\nlittle pipe-fish are big enough to look after themselves the sac\r\ndivides spontaneously down the middle, and allows them to escape, to\r\nshift for themselves in the broad Atlantic. Even so, however, the\r\njuniors take care always to keep tolerably near that friendly shelter,\r\nand creep back into it again on any threat of danger, exactly as\r\nbaby-kangaroos do into their mother's marsupium. The father-fish, in\r\nfact, has gone to the trouble and expense of developing out of his own\r\ntissues a membranous bag, on purpose to hold the eggs and young during\r\nthe first stages of their embryonic evolution. This bag is formed by\r\ntwo folds of the skin, one of which grows out from each side of the\r\nbody, the free margins being firmly glued together in the middle by a\r\nnatural exudation, while the eggs are undergoing incubation, but\r\nopening once more in the middle to let the little fish out as soon as\r\nthe process of hatching is fairly finished.\r\n\r\nSo curious a provision for the safety of the young in the pipe-fish may\r\nbe compared to some extent, as I hinted above, with the pouch in which\r\nkangaroos and other marsupial animals carry their cubs after birth,\r\ntill they have attained an age of complete independence. But the\r\nstrangest part of it all is the fact that while in the kangaroo it is\r\nthe mother who owns the pouch and takes care of the young, in the\r\npipe-fish it is the father, on the contrary, who thus specially\r\nprovides for the safety of his defenceless offspring. And what is odder\r\nstill, this topsy-turvy arrangement (as it seems to us) is the common\r\nrule throughout the class of fishes. For the most part it must be\r\ncandidly admitted by their warmest admirer, fish make very bad parents\r\nindeed. They lay their eggs anywhere on a suitable spot, and as soon as\r\nthey have once deposited them, like the ostrich in Job, they go on\r\ntheir way rejoicing, and never bestow another passing thought upon\r\ntheir deserted progeny. But if ever a fish _does_ take any pains in the\r\neducation and social upbringing of its young, you're pretty sure to\r\nfind on enquiry it's the father--not as one would naturally expect, the\r\nmother--who devotes his time and attention to the congenial task of\r\nhatching or feeding them. It is he who builds the nest, and sits upon\r\nthe eggs, and nurses the young, and imparts moral instruction (with a\r\nsnap of his jaw or a swish of his tail) to the bold, the truant, the\r\ncheeky, or the imprudent; while his unnatural spouse, well satisfied\r\nwith her own part in having merely brought the helpless eggs into this\r\nworld of sorrow, goes off on her own account in the giddy whirl of\r\nsociety, forgetful of the sacred claims of her wriggling offspring upon\r\na mother's heart.\r\n\r\nIn the pipe-fish family, too, the ardent evolutionist can trace a whole\r\nseries of instructive and illustrative gradations in the development of\r\nthis instinct and the corresponding pouch-like structure among the male\r\nfish. With the least highly-evolved types, like the long-nosed\r\npipe-fish of the English Channel, and many allied forms from European\r\nseas, there is no pouch at all, but the father of the family carries\r\nthe eggs about with him, glued firmly on to the service of his abdomen\r\nby a natural mucus. In a somewhat more advanced tropical kind, the\r\nridges of the abdomen are slightly dilated, so as to form an open\r\ngroove, which loosely holds the eggs, though its edges do not meet in\r\nthe middle as in the great pipe-fish. Then come yet other more\r\nprogressive forms, like the great pipe-fish himself, where the folds\r\nmeet so as to produce a complete sac, which opens at maturity, to let\r\nout its little inmates. And finally, in the common Mediterranean\r\nsea-horses, which you can pick up by dozens on the Lido at Venice, and\r\na specimen of which exists in the dried form in every domestic museum,\r\nthe pouch is permanently closed by coalescence of the edges, leaving a\r\nnarrow opening in front, through which the small hippocampi creep out\r\none by one as soon as they consider themselves capable of buffeting the\r\nwaves of the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nFish that take much care of their offspring naturally don't need to\r\nproduce eggs in the same reckless abundance as those dissipated kinds\r\nthat leave their spawn exposed on the bare sandy bottom, at the mercy\r\nof every comer who chooses to take a bite at it. They can afford to lay\r\na smaller number, and to make each individual egg much larger and\r\nricher in proportion than their rivals. This plan, of course, enables\r\nthe young to begin life far better provided with muscles and fins than\r\nthe tiny little fry which come out of the eggs of the improvident\r\nspecies. For example, the cod-fish lays nine million odd eggs; but\r\nanybody who has ever eaten fried cod's-roe must needs have noticed that\r\neach individual ovum was so very small as to be almost indistinguishable\r\nto the naked eye. Thousands of these infinitesimal specks are devoured\r\nbefore they hatch out by predaceous fish; thousands more of the young\r\nfry are swallowed alive during their helpless infancy by the enemies of\r\ntheir species. Imagine the very fractional amount of parental affection\r\nwhich each of the nine million must needs put up with! On the other\r\nhand, there is a paternally-minded group of cat-fish known as the genus\r\n_Arius_, of Ceylon, Australia, and other tropical parts, the males of\r\nwhich carry about the ova loose in their mouths, or rather in an\r\nenlargement of the pharynx, somewhat resembling the pelican's pouch;\r\nand the spouses of these very devoted sires lay accordingly only very\r\nfew ova, all told, but each almost as big as a hedge-sparrow's egg--a\r\nwonderful contrast to the tiny mites of the cod-fish. To put it\r\nbriefly, the greater the amount of protection afforded the eggs, the\r\nsmaller the number and the larger the size. And conversely, the larger\r\nthe size of the egg to start with, the better fitted to begin the\r\nbattle of life is the young fish when first turned out on a cold world\r\nupon his own resources.\r\n\r\nThis is a general law, indeed, that runs through all nature, from\r\nLondon slums to the deep sea. Wasteful species produce many young, and\r\ntake but little care of them when once produced. Economical species\r\nproduce very few young, but start each individual well-equipped for its\r\nplace in life and look after them closely till they can take care of\r\nthemselves in the struggle for existence. And on the average, however\r\nmany or however few the offspring to start with, just enough attain\r\nmaturity in the long run to replace their parents in the next\r\ngeneration. Were it otherwise, the sea would soon become one solid mass\r\nof herring, cod, and mackerel.\r\n\r\nThese cat-fish, however, are not the only good fathers that carry their\r\nyoung (like woodcock) in their own mouths. A freshwater species of the\r\nSea of Galilee, _Chromis Andreæ_ by name (dedicated by science to the\r\nmemory of that fisherman apostle, St. Andrew, who must often have\r\nnetted them), has the same habit of hatching out its young in its own\r\ngullet: and here again it is the male fish upon whom this apparently\r\nmaternal duty devolves, just as it is the male cassowary that sits upon\r\nthe eggs of his unnatural mate, and the male emu that tends the nest,\r\nwhile the hen bird looks on superciliously and contents herself with\r\nexercising a general friendly supervision of the nursery department. I\r\nmay add parenthetically that in most fish families the eggs are\r\nfertilised after they have been laid, instead of before, which no doubt\r\naccounts for the seeming anomaly.\r\n\r\nStill, good mothers too may be found among fish, though far from\r\nfrequently. One of the Guiana catfishes, known as Aspredo, very much\r\nresembles her countrywoman the Surinam toad in her nursery\r\narrangements. Of course you know the Surinam toad--whom not to know\r\nargues yourself unknown--that curious creature that carries her eggs in\r\nlittle pits on her back, where the young hatch out and pass through\r\ntheir tadpole stage in a slimy fluid, emerging at last from the cells\r\nof this living honeycomb only when they have attained the full\r\namphibian honours of four-legged maturity. Well, Aspredo among cat-fish\r\nmanages her brood in much the same fashion; only she carries her eggs\r\nbeneath her body instead of on her back like her amphibious rival. When\r\nspawning time approaches, and Aspredo's fancy lightly turns to thoughts\r\nof love, the lower side of her trunk begins to assume, by anticipation,\r\na soft and spongy texture, honeycombed with pits, between which are\r\narranged little spiky protuberances. After laying her eggs, the mother\r\nlies flat upon them on the river bottom, and presses them into the\r\nspongy skin, where they remain safely attached until they hatch out and\r\nbegin to manage for themselves in life. It is curious that the only two\r\ncreatures on earth which have hit out independently this original mode\r\nof providing for their offspring should both be citizens of Guiana,\r\nwhere the rivers and marshes must probably harbour some special danger\r\nto be thus avoided, not found in equal intensity in other fresh waters.\r\n\r\nA prettily marked fish of the Indian Ocean, allied, though not very\r\nclosely, to the pipe fishes, has also the distinction of handing over\r\nthe young to the care of the mother instead of the father. Its name is\r\nSolenostoma (I regret that no more popular title exists), and it has a\r\npouch, formed in this case by a pair of long broad fins, within which\r\nthe eggs are attached by interlacing threads that push out from the\r\nbody. Probably in this instance nutriment is actually provided through\r\nthese threads for the use of the embryo, in which case we must regard\r\nthe mechanism as very closely analogous indeed to that which obtains\r\namong mammals.\r\n\r\nSome few fish, indeed, are truly viviparous; among them certain\r\nblennies and carps, in which the eggs hatch out entirely within the\r\nbody of the mother. One of the most interesting of these divergent\r\ntypes is the common Californian and Mexican silver-fish, an inhabitant\r\nof the bays and inlets of sub-tropical America. Its chief peculiarity\r\nand title to fame lies in the extreme bigness of its young at birth.\r\nThe full-grown fish runs to about ten inches in length, fisherman's\r\nscale, while the fry measure as much as three inches apiece; so that\r\nthey lie, as Professor Seeley somewhat forcibly expresses it, 'packed\r\nin the body of the parent as close as herrings in a barrel.' This\r\nstrange habit of retaining the eggs till after they have hatched out is\r\nnot peculiar to fish among egg-laying animals, for the common little\r\nbrown English lizard is similarly viviparous, though most of its\r\nrelatives elsewhere deposit their eggs to be hatched by the heat of the\r\nsun in earth or sandbanks.\r\n\r\nMr. Hannibal Chollop, if I recollect aright, once shot an imprudent\r\nstranger for remarking in print that the ancient Athenians, that\r\ninferior race, had got ahead in their time of the modern Loco-foco\r\nticket. But several kinds of fish have undoubtedly got ahead in this\r\nrespect of the common reptilian ticket; for instead of leaving about\r\ntheir eggs anywhere on the loose to take care of themselves, they build\r\na regular nest, like birds, and sit upon their eggs till the fry emerge\r\nfrom them. All the sticklebacks, for instance, are confirmed\r\nnest-builders: but here once more it is the male, not the female, who\r\nweaves the materials together and takes care of the eggs during their\r\nperiod of incubation. The receptacle itself is made of fibres of\r\nwater-weeds or stalks of grass, and is open at both ends to let a\r\ncurrent pass through. As soon as the lordly little polygamist has built\r\nit, he coaxes and allures his chosen mates into the entrance, one by\r\none, to lay their eggs; and then when the nest is full, he mounts guard\r\nover them bravely, fanning them with his fins, and so keeping up a\r\ncontinual supply of oxygen which is necessary for the proper\r\ndevelopment of the embryo within. It takes a month's sitting before the\r\nyoung hatch out, and even after they appear, this excellent father\r\n(little Turk though he be, and savage warrior for the stocking of his\r\nharem) goes out attended by all his brood whenever he sallies forth for\r\na morning constitutional in search of caddis-worms, which shows that\r\nthere may be more good than we imagine, after all, in the domestic\r\ninstitutions even of people who don't agree with us.\r\n\r\nThe bullheads or miller's thumbs, those quaint big-headed beasts which\r\ndivide with the sticklebacks the polite attentions of ingenious British\r\nyouth, are also nest-builders, and the male fish are said to anxiously\r\nwatch and protect their offspring during their undisciplined nonage.\r\nEqually domestic are the habits of those queer shapeless creatures, the\r\nmarine lump-suckers, which fasten themselves on to rocks, like limpets,\r\nby their strange sucking disks, and defy all the efforts of enemy or\r\nfishermen to dislodge them by main force from their well-chosen\r\nposition. The pretty little tropical walking-fish of the filuroid\r\ntribe--those fish out of water--carry the nest-making instinct a point\r\nfurther, for they go ashore boldly at the beginning of the rainy season\r\nin their native woods, and scoop out a hole in the beach as a place of\r\nsafety, in which they make regular nests of leaves and other\r\nterrestrial materials to hold their eggs. Then father and mother take\r\nturns-about at looking after the hatching, and defend the spawn with\r\ngreat zeal and courage against all intruders.\r\n\r\nI regret to say, however, there are other unprincipled fish which\r\ndisplay their affection and care for their young in far more\r\nquestionable and unpleasant manners. For instance, there is that\r\nuncanny creature that inserts its parasitic fry as a tiny egg inside\r\nthe unsuspecting shells of mussels and cockles. Our fishermen are only\r\ntoo well acquainted, again, with one unpleasant marine lamprey, the hag\r\nor borer, so called because it lives parasitically upon other fishes,\r\nwhose bodies it enters, and then slowly eats them up from within\r\noutward, till nothing at all is left of them but skin, scales, and\r\nskeleton. They are repulsive eel-shaped creatures, blind, soft, and\r\nslimy; their mouth consists of a hideous rasping sucker; and they pour\r\nout from the glands on their sides a copious mucus, which makes them as\r\ndisagreeable to handle as they are unsightly to look at. Mackerel and\r\ncod are the hag's principal victims; but often the fisherman draws up a\r\nhag-eaten haddock on the end of his line, of which not a wrack remains\r\nbut the hollow shell or bare outer simulacrum. As many as twenty of\r\nthese disgusting parasites have sometimes been found within the body of\r\na single cod-fish.\r\n\r\nYet see how carefully nature provides nevertheless for the due\r\nreproduction of even her most loathsome and revolting creations. The\r\nhag not only lays a small number of comparatively large and well-stored\r\neggs, but also arranges for their success in life by supplying each\r\nwith a bundle of threads at either end, every such thread terminating\r\nat last in a triple hook, like those with which we are so familiar in\r\nthe case of adhesive fruits and seeds, like burrs or cleavers. By means\r\nof these barbed processes, the eggs attach themselves to living fishes;\r\nand the young borer, as soon as he emerges from his horny covering,\r\nmakes his way at once into the body of his unconscious host, whom he\r\nproceeds by slow degrees to devour alive with relentless industry, from\r\nthe intestines outward. This beautiful provision of nature enables the\r\ninfant hag to start in life at once in very snug quarters upon a\r\nready-made fish preserve. I understand, however, that cod-fish\r\nphilosophers, actuated by purely personal and selfish conceptions of\r\nutility, refuse to admit the beauty or beneficence of this most\r\nsatisfactory arrangement for the borer species.\r\n\r\nProbably the best known of all fishes' eggs, however (with the solitary\r\nexception of the sturgeon's, commonly observed between brown bread and\r\nbutter, under the name of caviare), are the queer leathery purse-shaped\r\nova of the sharks, rays, skates, and dog-fishes. Everybody has picked\r\nthem up on the seashore, where children know them as devil's purses and\r\ndevil's wheelbarrows. Most of these queer eggs are oblong and\r\nquadrangular, with the four corners produced into a sort of handles or\r\nstreamers, often ending in long tendrils, and useful for attaching them\r\nto corallines or seaweeds on the bed of the ocean. But it is worth\r\nnoticing that in colour the egg-cases closely resemble the common wrack\r\nto which they are oftenest fastened; and as they wave up and down in\r\nthe water with the dark mass around them, they must be almost\r\nindistinguishable from the wrack itself by the keenest-sighted of their\r\nenemies. This protective resemblance, coupled with the toughness and\r\nslipperiness of their leathery envelope or egg-shell, renders them\r\nalmost perfectly secure from all evil-minded intruders. As a\r\nconsequence, the dog-fish lay but very few eggs each season, and those\r\nfew, large and well provided with nutriment for their spotted\r\noffspring. It is these purses, and those of the thornback and the\r\nedible skate, that we oftenest pick up on the English coast. The larger\r\noceanic sharks are mostly viviparous.\r\n\r\nIn some few cases, indeed, among the shark and ray family, the\r\nmechanism for protection goes a step or two further than in these\r\nsimple kinds. That well-known frequenter of Australian harbours, the\r\nPort Jackson shark, lays a pear-shaped egg, with a sort of spiral\r\nstaircase of leathery ridges winding round it outside, Chinese pagoda\r\nwise, so that even if you bite it (I speak in the person of a\r\npredaceous fish) it eludes your teeth, and goes dodging off\r\nscrew-fashion into the water beyond. There's no getting at this evasive\r\nbody anywhere; when you think you have it, it wriggles away sideways,\r\nand refuses to give any hold for jaws or palate. In fact, a more\r\nslippery or guileful egg was never yet devised by nature's unconscious\r\ningenuity. Then, again, the Antarctic chimæra (so called from its very\r\nunprepossessing personal appearance) relies rather upon pure deception\r\nthan upon mechanical means for the security of its eggs. The shell or\r\ncase in this instance is prolonged at the edge into a kind of broad\r\nwing on either side, so that it exactly resembles one of the large flat\r\nleaves of the Antarctic fucus in whose midst it lurks. It forms the\r\nhigh-water mark, I fancy, of protective resemblance amongst eggs, for\r\nnot only is the margin leaf-like in shape, but it is even gracefully\r\nwaved and fringed with floating hairs, as is the fashion with the\r\nexpanded fronds of so many among the gigantic far-southern sea-weeds.\r\n\r\nA most curious and interesting set of phenomena are those which often\r\noccur when a group of fishes, once marine, take by practice to\r\ninhabiting freshwater rivers; or, _vice-versâ,_ when a freshwater kind,\r\nmoved by an aspiration for more expansive surroundings, takes up its\r\nresidence in the sea as a naturalised marine. Whenever such a change of\r\naddress happens, it usually follows that the young fry cannot stand the\r\nconditions of the new home to which their ancestors were\r\nunaccustomed--we all know the ingrained conservatism of children--and\r\nso the parents are obliged once a year to undertake a pilgrimage to\r\ntheir original dwelling-place for the breeding season.\r\n\r\nExtreme cases of terrestrial animals, once aquatic in habits, throw a\r\nflood of lurid light (as the newspapers say) upon the reason why this\r\nshould be so. For example, frogs and toads develop from tadpoles, which\r\nin all essentials are true gill-breathing fish. It is, therefore,\r\nobvious that they cannot lay their eggs on dry land, where the tadpoles\r\nwould be unable to find anything to breathe; so that even the driest\r\nand most tree-haunting toads must needs repair to the water once a year\r\nto deposit their spawn in its native surroundings. Once more, crabs\r\npass their earlier larval stages as free-swimming crustaceans, somewhat\r\nshrimp-like in appearance, and as agile as fleas: it is only by gradual\r\nmetamorphosis that they acquire their legs and claws and heavy\r\npedestrian habits. Now there are certain kinds of crab, like the West\r\nIndian land-crabs (those dainty morsels whose image every epicure who\r\nhas visited the Antilles still enshrines with regret in a warm corner\r\nof his heart), which have taken in adult life to walking bodily on\r\nshore, and visiting the summits of the highest mountains, like the fish\r\nof Deucalion's deluge in Horace. But once a year, as the land-crabs\r\nbask in the sun on St. Catherine's Peak or the Fern Walk, a strange\r\ninstinctive longing comes over them automatically to return for a while\r\nto their native element; and, obedient to that inner monitor of their\r\nrace, down they march in thousands, _velut agmine facto_, to lay their\r\neggs at their leisure in Port Royal harbour. On the way, the negroes\r\ncatch them, all full of rich coral, waiting to be spawned; and Chloe or\r\nDinah, serves them up hot, with breadcrumbs, in their own red shells,\r\nneatly nestling between the folds of a nice white napkin. The rest run\r\naway, and deposit their eggs in the sea, where the young hatch out, and\r\npass their larval stage once more as free and active little swimming\r\ncrustaceans.\r\n\r\nWell, crabs, I need hardly explain in this age of enlightenment, are\r\nnot fish; but their actions help to throw a side-light on the migratory\r\ninstinct in salmon, eels, and so many other true fish which have\r\nchanged with time their aboriginal habits. The salmon himself, for\r\ninstance, is by descent a trout, and in the parr stage he is even now\r\nalmost indistinguishable from many kinds of river-trout that never\r\nmigrate seaward at all. But at some remote period, the ancestors of the\r\ntrue salmon took to going down to the great deep in search of food, and\r\nbeing large and active fish, found much more to eat in the salt water\r\nthan ever they had discovered in their native streams. So they settled\r\npermanently in their new home, as far as their own lives went at least;\r\nthough they found the tender young could not stand the brine that did\r\nno harm to the tougher constitutions of the elders. No doubt the change\r\nwas made gradually, a bit at a time, through the brackish water, the\r\nspecies getting further and further seaward down bays and estuaries\r\nwith successive generations, but always returning to spawn in its\r\nnative river, as all well-behaved salmon do to the present moment. At\r\nlast, the habit hardened into an organic instinct, and nowadays the\r\nyoung salmon hatch out like their fathers as parr in fresh water, then\r\ngo to the sea in the grilse stage and grow enormously, and finally\r\nreturn as full-grown salmon to spawn and breed in their particular\r\nbirthplace.\r\n\r\nExactly the opposite fate has happened to the eels. The salmonoids as a\r\nfamily are freshwater fish, and by far the greater number of\r\nkinds--trout, char, whitefish, grayling, pollan, vendace, gwyniad, and\r\nso forth--are inhabitants of lakes, steams, ponds, and rivers, only a\r\nvery small number having taken permanently or temporarily to a marine\r\nresidence. But the eels, as a family, are a saltwater group, most of\r\ntheir allies, like the congers and murænas, being exclusively confined\r\nto the sea, and only a very small number of aberrant types having ever\r\ntaken to invading inland waters. If the life-history of the salmon,\r\nhowever, has given rise to as much controversy as the Mar peerage, the\r\nlife-history of the eel is a complete mystery. To begin with, nobody\r\nhas ever so much as distinguished between male and female eels; except\r\nmicroscopically, eels have never been seen in the act of spawning, nor\r\nobserved anywhere with mature eggs. The ova themselves are wholly\r\nunknown: the mode of their production is a dead secret. All we know is\r\nthis: that eels never reproduce in fresh water; that a certain number\r\nof adults descend the rivers to the sea, irregularly, during the winter\r\nmonths; and that some of these must presumably spawn with the utmost\r\ncircumspection in brackish water or in the deep sea, for in the course\r\nof the summer myriads of young eels, commonly called grigs, and\r\nproverbial for their merriment, ascend the rivers in enormous bodies,\r\nand enter every smaller or larger tributary.\r\n\r\nIf we know little about the paternity and maternity of eels, we know a\r\ngreat deal about their childhood and youth, or, to speak more eelishly,\r\ntheir grigginess and elverhood. The young grigs, when they do make\r\ntheir appearance, leave us in no doubt at all about their presence or\r\ntheir reality. They wriggle up weirs, walls, and floodgates; they force\r\nthere way bodily through chinks and apertures; they find out every\r\ndrain, pipe, or conduit in a given plane rectilinear figure; and when\r\nall other spots have been fully occupied, they take to dry land, like\r\nveritable snakes, and cut straight across country for the nearest lake,\r\npond, or ornamental waters.\r\n\r\nThese swarms or migrations are known to farmers as eel-fairs; but the\r\nword ought more properly to be written eel-fares, as the eels then fare\r\nor travel up the streams to their permanent quarters. A great many\r\neels, however, never migrate seaward at all, and never seem to attain\r\nto years of sexual maturity. They merely bury themselves under stones\r\nin winter, and live and die as celibates in their inland retreats. So\r\nvery terrestrial do they become, indeed, that eels have been taken with\r\nrats or field-mice undigested in their stomachs.\r\n\r\nThe sturgeon is another more or less migratory fish, originally (like\r\nthe salmon) of freshwater habits, but now partially marine, which\r\nascends its parent stream for spawning during the summer season.\r\nIncredible quantities are caught for caviare in the great Russian\r\nrivers. At one point on the Volga, a hundred thousand people collect in\r\nspring for the fishery, and work by relays, day and night continuously,\r\nas long as the sturgeons are going up stream. On some of the\r\ntributaries, when fishing is intermitted for a single day, the\r\nsturgeons have been known to completely fill a river 360 feet wide, so\r\nthat the backs of the uppermost fish were pushed out of the water. (I\r\ntake this statement, not from the 'Arabian Nights,' as the scoffer\r\nmight imagine, but from that most respectable authority, Professor\r\nSeeley.) Still, in spite of the enormous quantity killed, there is no\r\ndanger of any falling off in the supply for the future, for every fish\r\nlays from two to three million eggs, each of which, as caviare eaters\r\nwell know, is quite big enough to be distinctly seen with the naked eye\r\nin the finished product. The best caviare is simply bottled exactly as\r\nfound, with the addition merely of a little salt. No man of taste can\r\npretend to like the nasty sun-dried sort, in which the individual eggs\r\nare reduced to a kind of black pulp, and pressed hard with the feet\r\ninto doubtful barrels.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me add one word of warning as to certain popular\r\nerrors about the young fry of sundry well-known species. Nothing is\r\nmore common than to hear it asserted that sprats are only immature\r\nherring. This is a complete mistake. Believe it not. Sprats are a very\r\ndistinct species of the herring genus, and they never grow much bigger\r\nthan when they appear, _brochés_, at table. The largest adult sprat\r\nmeasures only six inches, while full-grown herring may attain as much\r\nas fifteen. Moreover, herring have teeth on the palate, always wanting\r\nin sprats, by which means the species may be readily distinguished at\r\nall ages. When in doubt, therefore, do not play trumps, but examine the\r\npalate. On the other hand, whitebait, long supposed to be a distinct\r\nspecies, has now been proved by Dr. Günther, the greatest of\r\nichthyologists, to consist chiefly of the fry or young of herring. To\r\ncomplete our discomfiture, the same eminent authority has also shown\r\nthat the pilchard and the sardine, which we thought so unlike, are one\r\nand the same fish, called by different names according as he is caught\r\noff the Cornish coast or in Breton, Portuguese, or Mediterranean\r\nwaters. Such aliases are by no means uncommon among his class. To say\r\nthe plain truth, fish are the most variable and ill-defined of animals;\r\nthey differ so much in different habitats, so many hybrids occur\r\nbetween them, and varieties merge so readily by imperceptible stages\r\ninto one another, that only an expert can decide in doubtful cases--and\r\nevery expert carefully reverses the last man's opinion. Let us at least\r\nbe thankful that whitebait by any other name would eat as nice; that\r\nscience has not a single whisper to breathe against their connection\r\nwith lemon; and that whether they are really the young of _Clupea\r\nharengus_ or not, the supply at Billingsgate shows no symptom of\r\nfalling short of the demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        AN ENGLISH SHIRE.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons which have determined the existence of Sussex as a\r\ncounty of England, and which have given it the exact boundaries that it\r\nnow possesses, we must go back to the remote geological history of the\r\nsecondary ages. Its limits and its very existence as a separate shire\r\nwere predetermined for it by the shape and consistence of the mud or\r\nsand which gathered at the bottom of the great Wealden lake, or filled\r\nup the hollows of the old inland cretaceous sea. Paradoxical as it\r\nsounds to say so, the Celtic kingdom of the Regni, the South Saxon\r\nprincipality of Ælle the Bretwalda, the modern English county of\r\nSussex, have all had their destinies moulded by the geological\r\nconformation of the rock upon which they repose. Where human annals see\r\nonly the handicraft and interaction of human beings--Euskarian and\r\nAryan, Celt and Roman, Englishman and Norman--a closer scrutiny of\r\nhistory may perhaps see the working of still deeper elements--chalk and\r\nclay, volcanic upheaval and glacial denudation, barren upland and\r\nforest-clad plain. The value and importance of these underlying facts\r\nin the comprehension of history has, I believe, been very generally\r\noverlooked; and I propose accordingly here to take the single county of\r\nSussex in detail, in order to show that when the geological and\r\ngeographical factors of the problem are given, all the rest follows as\r\na matter of course. By such detailed treatment alone can one hope to\r\nestablish the truth of the general principle that human history is at\r\nbottom a result of geographical conditions, acting upon the\r\nfundamentally identical constitution of man.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense, it is quite clear that human life depends mainly\r\nupon soil and conformation, to an extent that nobody denies. You cannot\r\nhave a dense population in Sahara; and you can hardly fail to have one\r\nin the fruitful valley of the Nile. The growth of towns in one district\r\nrather than another must be governed largely by the existence of rivers\r\nor harbours, of coal or metals, of agricultural lowlands or defensible\r\nheights. Glasgow could not spring up in inland Leicestershire, nor\r\nManchester in coalless Norfolk. Insular England must naturally be the\r\ngreatest shipping country in Europe; while no large foreign trade is\r\npossible in any Bohemia except Shakespeare's. So much everybody admits.\r\nBut it seems to me that these underlying causes have coloured the\r\nentire local history of every district to an extent which few people\r\nadequately recognise, and that until such recognition becomes more\r\ngeneral, our views of history must necessarily be very narrow. We must\r\nsee not only that something depends upon geographical configuration,\r\nnot even merely that a great deal depends upon it, but that everything\r\ndepends upon it. We must unlearn our purely human history, and learn a\r\nhistory of interaction between nature and man instead.\r\n\r\nFrom the great central boss of the chalk system in Salisbury Plain, two\r\nlong cretaceous horns or projections run out to eastward towards the\r\nChannel and the German Sea. These two horns, separated by the deep\r\nvalley of the Weald, are known as the North and South Downs\r\nrespectively. The first great spur or ridge passes through the heart of\r\nSurrey, and then forms the backbone of Kent, expanding into a fan at\r\nits eastward extremity, where it topples over abruptly into the sea in\r\nthe sheer bluffs which sweep round in a huge arc from the North\r\nForeland in the Isle of Thanet, to Shakespeare's Cliff at Dover. The\r\nsecond or southernmost range, that of the South Downs, parts company\r\nfrom the main boss in Hampshire, and runs eastward in a narrower but\r\nbolder line, till the Channel cuts short its progress in the water-worn\r\nprecipice of Beachy Head. Between these two ranges of Downs lies the\r\nlow forest region of the Weald, and between the South Downs and the sea\r\nstretches a long but very narrow strip of lowland, beginning at\r\nChichester, and ending where the chalk cliffs first meet the shore\r\nbeside the new Aquarium and Chain Pier at Brighton. Thus the whole of\r\nSussex consists of three well-marked parallel belts: the low coast-line\r\non the south-west, the high chalk Downs in the centre, and the Weald\r\ndistrict on the north and north-west. As these three belts determine\r\nthe whole history and very existence of Sussex as an English shire, I\r\nshall make no apology for treating their origin here in some rapid\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe oldest geological formation with which we have to deal in Sussex\r\n(to any considerable extent) is the Wealden: so that our inquiry need\r\nnot go any farther back in the history of the world than the later\r\nsecondary ages. Before that time, and for long æons afterward, the\r\nportion of the earth's crust which now forms Sussex had probably never\r\nemerged from the ocean. Britain was then wholly represented by the\r\nprimary regions of Wales, Scotland, and Cornwall, forming a small\r\narchipelago or group of rocky islands separated at some distance by a\r\nwide passage from the nucleus of the young European continent. But by\r\nthe Wealden period, the English Channel and the Eastern half of England\r\nhad been considerably elevated above the level of the sea. Great rivers\r\nand lakes existed in this new continental region, much like those which\r\nnow exist in Sweden, Northern Russia, and Canada; and the deposits of\r\nsand or mud formed at their bottoms or in their estuaries compose the\r\nchief part of the Wealden formation in England. Without going fully\r\ninto this question (somewhat complicated by frequent changes of level),\r\nit will suffice for our present purpose to say that the Wealden\r\nconsists, in the main, of two great divisions, which form, so to speak,\r\nthe floor, or lowest story, of the Sussex formations. The first or\r\nbottom division is chiefly composed of a rather soft and friable\r\nsandstone, which runs through the whole Forest Ridges, and crops out in\r\nthe grey cliffs of Hastings and Fairlight. The second or upper division\r\nis chiefly composed of a thick greasy clay, which forms the soil in the\r\ngreater part of the Weald, and glides unobtrusively under the sea in\r\nthe flat shore on either side of Hastings, giving rise to the lowlands\r\nof Pevensey Bay and the Romney Marshes. Why the sandstone, which is\r\nreally the bottom layer, should appear higher than the clay in these\r\nplaces, we shall see a little later.\r\n\r\nAfter the deposition of the gritty or muddy Wealden beds in the lake\r\nand _embouchure_ of the old continental river, there came a second\r\nperiod of considerable depression, during which the whole of\r\nsouth-eastern England was once more covered by a shallow sea. This sea\r\nran, like an early northern Mediterranean, right across the face of\r\nCentral Europe; and on its bottom was deposited the soft ooze of\r\nglobigerina shells and siliceous sponge skeletons which has now\r\nhardened into chalk and flint. A great cretaceous sheet thus overlay\r\nthe Wealden beds and the whole face of Sussex to a depth of at least\r\n600 feet; and if it had not been afterwards worn off in places, as the\r\nnursery rhyme says of old Pillicock, it would be there still. I need\r\nhardly say that the chalk is yet _en évidence_ along the whole range of\r\nSouth Downs, and forms the tall white cliffs between Brighton and\r\nBeachy Head.\r\n\r\nFinally, during the Tertiary period, another layer of London clay and\r\nother soft deposits was spread over the top of the chalk, certainly on\r\nthe strip between the South Downs and the sea, and probably over the\r\nwhole district between the Channel and the Thames valley: though in\r\nthis case, later denudation has proceeded so far that very few traces\r\nof the Tertiary formations are preserved anywhere except in the greater\r\nhollows.\r\n\r\nSuch being the original disposition of the strata which compose Sussex,\r\nwe have next to ask, What are the causes which have produced its\r\nexisting configuration? If the whole mass had merely been uplifted\r\nstraight out of the sea, we ought now to find the whole country a flat\r\nand level table-land, covered over its entire surface with a uniform\r\ncoat of Tertiary deposits. On digging or boring below these, we ought\r\nto come upon the chalk, and below the chalk again, with its cretaceous\r\ncongeners the greensand or the gault, we ought to meet the Weald clay\r\nand the Hastings sand. Wherever a seaward cliff exhibited a section for\r\nour observation, we ought to find these same strata all exposed in\r\nregular order--the sandstone at the bottom, the clay above it, the\r\nbroad belt of chalk halfway up, and the Tertiary muds and rubbles at\r\nthe top. But in the county as we actually find it, we get a very\r\ndifferent state of things. Here, the surface at sea-level is composed\r\nof London clay; there, a great mound of chalk rises into a swelling\r\ndown; and yonder, once more, a steep escarpment leads us down into a\r\nbroad lowland of the Weald. The causes which have led to this\r\narrangement of surface and conformation must now be considered with\r\nnecessary brevity.\r\n\r\nThe North and South Downs, with all the country between them, form part\r\nof a great fold or outward bulge of the strata above enumerated, having\r\nits centre about the middle line of the Forest Ridge. Imagine these\r\nstrata bent or pushed upward by an internal upheaving force acting\r\nalong that line, and you will get a rough picture of the original\r\ncircumstances which have led to the existing arrangement of the county.\r\nYou would then have, instead of a flat table-land, as supposed above, a\r\ngreat curved mountain slope, with its centre on top of the Forest\r\nRidge. This gentle slope would rise from the sea between Chichester and\r\na point south of Beachy, would swell slowly upward till it reached a\r\nheight of two or three thousand feet at the Surrey border, and would\r\nfall again gradually towards the Thames valley at London. On the\r\nsouthern side of the Downs this is pretty much what we now get, the\r\nTertiary strata being preserved in the district near Chichester; though\r\nfarther east, around Newhaven and Beachy Head, the sea has encroached\r\nupon the chalk so as to cut out the great white cliffs which bound the\r\nview everywhere along the shore from Brighton to Eastbourne. In the\r\ncentral portion of the boss, however, almost all the highest elevated\r\npart has been denuded by ice or water action. Between the North and\r\nSouth Downs, where we ought to find the mountain ridge, we find instead\r\nthe valley of the Weald. Here the chalk has been quite worn away,\r\ngiving rise to the steep escarpment on the northern side of the South\r\nDowns, seen from the Devil's Dyke, so that at the foot of the sudden\r\ndescent we get the Weald clay exposed; while in the very centre of the\r\nupheaved tract the clay itself has been cut through, and the Hastings\r\nsand appears upon the surface. Moreover, the sand, being upraised by\r\nthe central force, stands higher than the clay on either side, which\r\nforms the trough of the Weald; and thus the forest ridge, which abuts\r\nupon the sea in the cliffs of Hastings Castle, seems to lie above the\r\nclay, under which, however, it really glides on either side. I need\r\nhardly add that this rough diagrammatic description is only meant as a\r\ngeneral indication of the facts, and that it considerably simplifies\r\nthe real geological changes probably involved in the sculpture of\r\nSussex. Nevertheless, I believe it pretty accurately represents the\r\nmain formative points in the ante-human history of the county.\r\n\r\nSo much by way of preface or introduction. These facts of structure\r\nform the data for the reconstruction of the Sussex annals during the\r\nhuman period. Upon them as framework all the subsequent development of\r\nthe county hangs. And first let us observe how, before the advent of\r\nman upon the scene, the shire was already strictly demarcated by its\r\nnatural boundaries. Along the coast, between Chichester Harbour and\r\nBrighton, stretched a long, narrow, level strip of clay and alluvium,\r\nsuitable for the dwelling-place of an agricultural people. Back of this\r\ncoastwise belt lay the bare rounded range of the South Downs--good\r\ngrazing land for sheep, but naturally incapable of cultivation. Two\r\nrivers, however, flowed in deep valleys through the Downs, and their\r\nbasins, with the outlying combes and glens, were also the predestined\r\nseats of agricultural communities. The one was the Ouse, passing\r\nthrough the fertile country around Lewes, and falling at last into the\r\nEnglish Channel at Seaford, not as now at Newhaven; the other was the\r\nCuckmere river, which has cut itself a deep glen in the chalk hills\r\njust beneath the high cliffs of Beachy Head. Beyond the Downs again, to\r\nthe north, the country descended abruptly to the deep trough of the\r\nWeald, whose cold and sticky clays or porous sandstones are never of\r\nany use for purposes of tillage. Hence, as its very name tells us, the\r\nWeald has always been a wild and wood-clad region. The Romans knew it\r\nas the Silva Anderida, or forest of Pevensey; the early English as the\r\nAndredesweald. Both names are derived from a Celtic root signifying\r\n'The Uninhabited.' Even in our own day, a large part of this tract is\r\ncovered by the woodlands of Tolgate Forest, St. Leonard's Forest, and\r\nAshdown Forest; while the remainder is only very scantily laid down in\r\npasture-land or hop-fields, with a considerable sprinkling of copses,\r\nwoods, commons, and parks. From its very nature, indeed, the Weald can\r\nnever be anything else, in its greater portion, than a wild,\r\nuncultivated, and wooded region.\r\n\r\nLet us note, too, how the really habitable strip of Sussex, from the\r\npoint of view of an early people, was quite naturally cut off from all\r\nother parts of England by obvious limits. This habitable strip\r\nconsists, of course, of the coastwise belt from Brighton to the\r\nHampshire border (which belt I shall henceforward take the liberty of\r\ndesignating as Sussex Proper), together with the seaward valleys and\r\ncombes of the South Downs. To the west, the great tidal flats and\r\nswamps about Hayling Island cut off Sussex from Hampshire; and before\r\ndrainage and reclamation had done their work, these marshy districts\r\nmust have formed a most impassable frontier. From this point, the great\r\nwoodland region of the Weald, thickly covered with primæval forest, and\r\ntenanted by wolves, bears, wild boars, and red deer, swept round in a\r\nlong curve from the swamps at Bosham and Havant to the corresponding\r\nswamps of the opposite end at Pevensey and Hurstmonceux. The belt of\r\nsavage wooded country, thick with the lairs of wild beasts, which thus\r\nringed round the greater part of the county, shut off the coastwise\r\nstrip at once from all possibility of communication with the rest of\r\nEngland. So Sussex Proper and the combes of the Downs were naturally\r\npredestined to form a single Celtic kingdom, a single Saxon\r\nprincipality, and a single English shire.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this description leaves wholly out of\r\nconsideration the strip of country about Hastings, Rye, and Winchelsea.\r\nIt does so intentionally. That strip of country does not belong to\r\nSussex in the same intimate and strictly necessary manner as the rest\r\nof the county. It probably once formed the seat of a small independent\r\ncommunity by itself; and though there were good and obvious reasons why\r\nit should become finally united to Sussex rather than to Kent, it may\r\nbe regarded as to some extent a debateable island between them. For an\r\nisland it practically was in early times. At Pevensey Bay the Weald ran\r\ndown into the sea by a series of swamps and bogs still artificially\r\ndrained by dykes and sluices. On the other side, the Romney marshes\r\nformed a similar though wider stretch of tidal flats, reclaimed and\r\ndrained at a far later period, partly through the agency of the long\r\nshingle bank thrown up round the low modern spit of Dungeness. Between\r\nthem, the Hastings cliffs rose high above marsh and sea. In their rear,\r\nthe Weald forest covered the ridge; so that the Hastings district\r\n(still a separate rape or division of the county) formed a sort of\r\nsmaller Sussex, divided, like the larger one, from all the rest of\r\nEngland by a semicircular belt of marsh, forest, and marsh once more.\r\nThese are the main elements out of which the history of the county is\r\nmade up.\r\n\r\nHow far such conditions may have acted upon the very earliest human\r\ninhabitants of Sussex--the palæolithic savages of the drift--before the\r\nlast Glacial epoch, it is impossible to say, because we know that many\r\nof them did not then exist, and that the present configuration of the\r\ncounty is largely due to subsequent agencies. Britain was then united\r\nto the continent by a broad belt of land, filling up the bed of the\r\nEnglish Channel, and it possessed a climate wholly different from that\r\nof the present day; while the position of the drift and the river\r\ngravels shows that the sculpture of the surface was then in many\r\nrespects unlike the existing distribution of hill and valley. We must\r\nconfine ourselves, therefore, to the later or recent period (subsequent\r\nto the last glaciation of Britain), during which man has employed\r\nimplements of polished stone, of bronze, and of iron.\r\n\r\nThe Euskarian neolithic population of Britain--a dark white race, like\r\nthe modern Basques--had settlements in Sussex, at least in the coast\r\ndistrict between the Downs and the sea. Here they could obtain in\r\nabundance the flints for the manufacture of their polished stone\r\nhatchets; while on the alluvial lowlands of Selsea and Shoreham they\r\ncould grow those cereals upon which they largely depended for their\r\ndaily bread. Neolithic monuments, indeed, are common along the range of\r\nthe South Downs, as they are also on the main mass of the chalk in\r\nSalisbury Plain; and at Cissbury Hill, near Worthing, we have remains\r\nof one of the largest neolithic camp refuges in Britain. The evidence\r\nof tumuli and weapons goes to show that the Euskarian people of Sussex\r\noccupied the coast belt and the combes of the Downs from the Chichester\r\nmarshland to Pevensey, but that they did not spread at all into the\r\nWeald. In fact, it is most probable that at this early period Sussex\r\nwas divided into several little tribes or chieftainships, each of which\r\nhad its own clearing in the lowland cut laboriously out of the forest\r\nby the aid of its stone axes; while in the centre stood the compact\r\nvillage of wooden huts, surrounded by a stockade, and girt without by\r\nthe small cultivated plots of the villagers. On the Downs above rose\r\nthe camp or refuge of the tribe--an earthwork rudely constructed in\r\naccordance with the natural lines of the hills--to which the whole body\r\nof people, with their women, children, and cattle, retreated in case of\r\nhostile invasion from the villagers on either side. It is not likely\r\nthat any foreigners from beyond the great forest belt of the Weald\r\nwould ever come on the war-trail across that dangerous and trackless\r\nwilderness; and it is probable, therefore, that the camps or refuges\r\nwere constructed as places of retreat for the tribes against their\r\nimmediate neighbours, rather than against alien intruders from without.\r\nHence we may reasonably conclude--as indeed is natural at such an early\r\nstage of civilisation--that the whole district was not yet consolidated\r\nunder a single rule, but that each village still remained independent,\r\nand liable to be engaged in hostilities with all others. Even if\r\nextended chieftainships over several villages had already been set up,\r\nas is perhaps implied by the great tumuli of chiefs and the size of the\r\ncamps in some parts of Britain, we must suppose them to have been\r\nconfined for the most part to a single river valley. If so, there may\r\nhave been petty Euskarian principalities, rude supremacies or\r\nchieftainships like those of South Africa, in the Chichester lowlands,\r\nin the dale of Arun, in the valleys of the Adur, the Ouse, and the\r\nCuckmere River, and perhaps, too, in the insulated Hastings region,\r\nbetween the Pevensey levels and the Romney marsh. These principalities\r\nwould then roughly coincide with the modern rapes of Chichester,\r\nArundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey, and Hastings. Each would possess its\r\nown group of villages, and tilled lowland, its own boundary of forest,\r\nand its own camp of refuge on the hill-tops. Cissbury almost\r\nundoubtedly formed such a camp for the fertile valley of the Adur and\r\nthe coast strip from Worthing to Brighton. On its summit has been\r\ndiscovered an actual manufactory of stone implements from the copious\r\nmaterial supplied by the flint veins in the chalk of which it is\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nSuch a society, left to itself in Sussex, could never have got much\r\nfurther than this. It could not discover or use metals, when it had no\r\nmetal in its soil except the small quantity of iron to be found in the\r\nthen inaccessible Weald. It had no copper and no tin, and therefore it\r\ncould not manufacture bronze. But the geographical position of England\r\ngenerally, within sight of the European continent, made it certain that\r\nif ever anywhere else bronze should come to be used, the\r\nbronze-weaponed people must ultimately cross over and subjugate the\r\nstone-weaponed aborigines of the island. Moreover, bronze was certain\r\nto be first hit upon in those countries where tin and copper were most\r\neasily workable--that is to say, in Asia. From Asia, the secret of its\r\nmanufacture spread to the outlying peninsula of Europe, where it was\r\nquickly adopted by the Aryan Celts, who had already invaded the\r\noutlying continent, armed only with weapons of stone. As soon as they\r\nhad learnt the use of bronze, certain great changes and improvements\r\nfollowed naturally--amongst others, an immense advance in the art of\r\nboat-building. The Celts of the bronze age soon constructed vessels\r\nwhich enabled them to cross the narrow seas and invade Britain. Their\r\nsuperior weapons gave them at once an enormous advantage over the\r\nEuskarian natives, armed only with their polished flint hatchets, and\r\nbefore long they overran the whole island, save only the recesses of\r\nWales and the north of Scotland. From that moment, the bronze age of\r\nBritain set in--say some 1,000 or 1,500 years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe Celts, however, did not exterminate the whole Euskarian people;\r\nthey were too few in number and too far advanced in civilisation for\r\nsuch a course. They knew it was better to make them slaves than to\r\ndestroy them: for the Celts had just reached, but had not yet got\r\nbeyond, the slave-making stage of culture. To this day, people of mixed\r\nEuskarian parentage, and marked by the long skull, dark complexion, and\r\nblack eyes of the Euskarian type, form a large proportion of the\r\nEnglish peasantry; and they are found even in Sussex, which\r\nsubsequently suffered more than most other parts of Britain from the\r\ndestructive deluge of Teutonic barbarism in the fifth century. But\r\nthough the Celts did not exterminate the Euskarians, they completely\r\nCelticised them, just as the Teuton is now Teutonising the old\r\npopulation of Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. In South Wales and\r\nelsewhere, indeed, the aborigines retained their own language and\r\ninstitutions, as Silures and so forth; but in the conquered districts\r\nof southern and eastern Britain they learned the tongue of their\r\nmasters, and came to be counted as Celtic serfs. Thus, at the time when\r\nBritain comes forth into the full historic glare of Roman civilisation,\r\nwe find the country inhabited by a Celtic aristocracy of Aryan\r\ntype--round-headed, fair-haired, and blue-eyed; together-with a _plebs_\r\nof Celticised Euskarian or half-caste serfs, retaining, as they still\r\nretain, the long skulls and dark complexions of their aboriginal\r\nancestors. This was the ethnical composition of the Sussex population\r\nat the date of the first Roman invasions.\r\n\r\nUnder the bronze-weaponed Celts, a very different type of civilisation\r\nbecame possible. In the first place a more extended chieftainship\r\nresulted from the improved weapons and consequent military power; and\r\nall Britain (at least, towards the close of the Celtic domination)\r\nbecame amalgamated into considerable kingdoms, some of which seem to\r\nhave spread over several modern shires. Sussex, however, enclosed by\r\nits barrier of forest, would naturally remain a single little\r\nprincipality of itself, held, at least in later times, by a tribe known\r\nto the Romans as Regni. Traces of Celtic occupation are mainly confined\r\nto the Downs and the seaward slope of Sussex Proper; in the broad\r\nexpanse of the Weald, they are few and far between. The Celts occupied\r\nthe fertile valleys and alluvial slopes, cut down the woods by the\r\nriver sides and on the plains, and built their larger and more regular\r\ncamps of refuge upon the Downs, for protection against the kindred\r\nCantii beyond the Weald, or the more distantly-related Belgæ across the\r\nHayling tidal flats. Of these hill-forts, Hollingbury Castle, near\r\nBrighton, may be taken as a typical example. Bronze weapons and other\r\nimplements of the bronze age are found in great numbers about Lewes in\r\nparticular (where the isolated height, now crowned by the Norman\r\nCastle, must always have commanded the fertile river vale of the Ouse),\r\nas well as at Chichester, Bognor, and elsewhere. But the great forest,\r\ninhabited by savage beasts and still more terrible fiends, proved a\r\nbarrier to their northward extension. Even if they had cleared the\r\nland, they could not have cultivated it with their existing methods;\r\nand so it is only in a few spots near the upper river valleys that we\r\nfind any traces of outlying Celtic hamlets in the wilderness of the\r\nWeald. Some kind of trade, however, must have existed between the Regni\r\nand the other tribes of Britain, in order to supply them with the\r\nbronze, whose component elements Sussex does not possess. Woolsonbury,\r\nWestburton Hill, Clayton Hill, Wilmington, Hangleton Down, Plumpton\r\nPlain, and many other places along the coast have yielded large numbers\r\nof bronze implements; while the occurrence of the raw metal in lumps,\r\ntogether with the finished weapons, at Worthing and Beachy Head, as\r\nwell the discovery of a mould for a socketed celt at Wilmington, shows\r\nthat the actual foundry work was performed in Sussex itself. A\r\nbeautiful torque from Hollingbury Castle attests the workmanship of the\r\nSussex founders. No doubt the tin was imported from Cornwall, while the\r\ncopper was probably brought over from the continent. Glass beads,\r\ndoubtless of Southern (perhaps Egyptian) manufacture, have also been\r\nfound in Sussex, with implements of the bronze age.\r\n\r\nIn the polished stone age, the county had been self-supporting, because\r\nof its possession of flint. In the bronze age it was dependent upon\r\nother places, through its non-possession of copper or tin. During the\r\nformer period it may have exported weapons from Cissbury; during the\r\nlatter, it must have imported the material of weapons from Cornwall and\r\nGaul.\r\n\r\nBefore the Romans came, the Celts of Britain had learned the use of\r\niron. Whether they ever worked the iron of the Weald, however, is\r\nuncertain. But as the ores lie near the surface, as wood (to be made\r\ninto charcoal) for the smelting was abundant, and as these two facts\r\ncaused the Weald iron to be extensively employed in later times, it is\r\nprobable that small clearings would be made in the most accessible\r\nspots, and that rude ironworks would be established.\r\n\r\nThe same geographical causes which made Britain part of the Roman world\r\nnaturally affected Sussex, as one of its component portions. Even under\r\nthe Empire, however, the county remained singularly separate. The\r\nRomans built two strong fortresses at Anderida and Regnum, Pevensey and\r\nChichester, to guard the two Gwents or lowland plains, where the shore\r\nshelves slowly to seaward; and they ran one of their great roads across\r\nthe coastwise tract, from Dover to the Portus Magnus (now Porchester),\r\nnear Portsmouth; but they left Sussex otherwise very much to its own\r\ndevices. We know that the Regni were still permitted to keep their\r\nnative chief, who probably exercised over his tribesmen somewhat the\r\nsame subordinate authority which a Rájput raja now exercises under the\r\nBritish government. Here, again, we see the natural result of the\r\nisolation of Sussex. The Romans ruled directly in the open plains of\r\nthe Yorkshire Ouse and the Thames, as we ourselves rule in the Bengal\r\nDelta, the Doáb, and the Punjáb; but they left a measure of\r\nindependence to the native princes of south Wales, of Sussex, and of\r\nCornwall, as we ourselves do to the native rulers in the deserts of\r\nRájputana, the inaccessible mountains of Nipal, and the aboriginal hill\r\ndistricts of Central India.\r\n\r\nWhen the Roman power began to decay, the outlying possessions were the\r\nfirst to be given up. The Romans had enslaved and demoralised the\r\nprovincial population; and when they were gone, the great farms tilled\r\nby slave labour under the direction of Roman mortgagee-proprietors lay\r\nopen to the attacks of fresh and warlike barbarians from beyond the\r\nsea. How early the fertile east coasts of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and\r\nEast Anglia may have fallen a prey to the Teutonic pirates we cannot\r\nsay. The wretched legends, indeed, retailed to us by Gildas, Bæda, and\r\nthe English Chronicle, would have us believe that they were colonised\r\nat a later period; but as they lay directly in the path of the\r\nmarauders from Sleswick, as they were certainly Teutonised very\r\nthoroughly, and as no real records survive, we may well take it for\r\ngranted that the long-boats of the English, sailing down with the\r\nprevalent north-east winds from the wicks of Denmark, came first to\r\nshore on these fertile coasts. After they had been conquered and\r\ncolonised, the Saxon and Jutish freebooters began to look for\r\nsettlements, on their part, farther south. One horde, led, as the\r\nlegend veraciously assures us, by Hengest and Horsa, landed in Thanet;\r\nanother, composed entirely of Saxons, and under the command of a\r\ncertain dubious Ælle, came to shore on the spit of Selsea. It was from\r\nthis last body that the county took its newer name of Suth-Seaxe, Suth\r\nSexe, or Sussex. Let us first frankly narrate the legend, and then see\r\nhow far it may fairly be rationalised.\r\n\r\nIn 477, says the English Chronicle--written down, it must be\r\nremembered, from traditional sources, four centuries later, at the\r\ncourt of Alfred the West Saxon--in 477, Ælle and his three sons, Cymen,\r\nWlencing, and Cissa, came to Britain in three ships, and landed at the\r\nstow that is cleped Cymenes-ora. There that ilk day they slew many\r\nWelshmen, and the rest they drave into the wood hight Andredes-leah. In\r\n485, Ælle, fighting the Welsh near Mearcredes Burn, slew many, and the\r\nrest he put to flight. In 491, Ælle, with his son Cissa, beset\r\nAndredes-ceaster, and slew all that therein were, nor was there after\r\none Welshman left. Such is the whole story, as told in the bald and\r\nsimple entries of the West Saxon annalist, A more dubious tradition\r\nfurther states that Ælle was also Bretwalda, or overlord, of all the\r\nTeutonic tribes in Britain.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us see what we can make of this wholly unhistorical and\r\nlegendary tale. Whether there ever was a South Saxon king named Ælle we\r\ncannot say; but that the earliest English pirate fleet on this coast\r\nshould have landed near Selsea is likely enough. The marauders would\r\nnot land near the Romney marshes or the Pevensey flats, where the great\r\nfortresses of Lymne and Anderida would block their passage; and they\r\ncould not beach their keels easily anywhere along the cliff-girt coast\r\nbetween Beachy Head and Brighton; so they would naturally sail along\r\npast the marshland and the chalk cliffs till they reached the open\r\nchampaign shore near Chichester. Cymenes-ora, where they are said to\r\nhave landed, is now Keynor on the Bill of Selsea; and Selsea itself, as\r\nits name (correctly Selsey) clearly shows us, was then an island in the\r\ntidal flats. This was just the sort of place which the English pirates\r\nloved, for all tradition represents their first settlements as effected\r\non isolated spots like Thanet, Hurst Castle, Holderness, and\r\nBamborough. Thence they would march upon Regnum, the square Roman town\r\nat the harbour head, and reduce it by storm, garrisoned as it doubtless\r\nwas by a handful of semi-Romanised Welshmen or Britons. The town took\r\nthe English name of Cissanceaster, or Chichester. Moreover, all around\r\nthe Chichester district, we still find a group of English clan\r\nvillages, with the characteristic patronymic termination _ing_. Such\r\nare East and West Wittering, Donnington, Funtington, Didling, and\r\nothers. It is _vraisemblable_ enough that the little strip of very low\r\ncoast between Hayling Island and the Arun may have been the first\r\noriginal South Saxon colony. Nor is it by any means impossible that the\r\nnames of Keynor and Chichester Cymenes-ora and Cissanceaster--may still\r\nenshrine the memory of two among the old South Saxon freebooters.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of a battle at Mearcredes Burn, when the Welsh were again\r\ndefeated, may refer to an advance by which, a few years later, the\r\nSouth Saxon pirates pushed eastward along the coast, and occupied the\r\nstrip of shore as far as Brighton, together with the fertile valley of\r\nthe Lewes Ouse. In the first-named district we find a large group of\r\nEnglish Clan villages, including Patching, Poling, Angmering, Goring,\r\nWorthing, Tarring, Washington, Lullington, Blatchingden, Ovingdean,\r\nRottingdean, and many others. Amongst them is one which has clearly\r\ngiven rise to the name of Ælle's third son, and that is Lancing.\r\nUnfortunately for the legend, we must decide that this was really the\r\nsettlement of an English clan of Lancingas, as Washington was the _tun_\r\nor enclosure of the Weasingas, and Beddingham was the _ham_ or home of\r\nthe Beddingas. Around Lewes, in like manner, we find Tarring, Malling,\r\nPiddinghoe, Bletchington, and others; while in the valley just to the\r\neast we have ten or eleven such names as Lullington, Wilmington,\r\nFolkington, and Littlington. These districts, I imagine, represent the\r\nsecond advance of the English conquerors.\r\n\r\nFinally, fourteen years after the first landing, the South Saxons\r\ncrossed the Downs and attacked Anderida. The Roman walls of the great\r\nfortress were thick and strong, as their remains, built over by the\r\nNorman Castle, still show; but they were defended by half-trained\r\nWelsh, who could not withstand the English onset. With the fall of\r\nAnderida, the native power was broken for ever, 'nor was there after\r\none Welshman left.' The English tribe of the Hastingas settled at\r\nHastings; and the South Saxons were now supreme from marsh to marsh.\r\n\r\nBut did they really exterminate the native Celt-Euskarian population? I\r\nventure to say, no. Some no doubt, especially the men, they slew; but\r\nthe women and children, as even Mr. Freeman admits, were probably\r\nspared in large numbers. Even of the men, many doubtless became slaves\r\nto the Saxon lords; while others maintained themselves in isolated\r\nbands in the Weald. To this day the Euskarian type of humanity is not\r\nuncommon among the Sussex peasantry, and all the rivers still bear the\r\nCeltic names of Arun, Adur, Ouse, and Calder. That there was 'no\r\nWelshmen left' is only another way of saying that the armed Welsh\r\nresistance ceased. The Romanised Britons became English churls and\r\nserfs--nay, the very name for a serf in ordinary conversation was Weala\r\nor Welshman. The population received a new element--the English\r\nSaxons--but it was not completely changed. The Weorthingas and Goringas\r\nsimply became masters of the lands formerly held by Roman owners; and\r\nthe cabins of their British serfs still clustered around the wooden\r\nhall of the English lords.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Sussex is one of the most thoroughly Teutonised counties\r\nin England. The proportion of Saxon blood is very marked: light hair\r\nand blue eyes, together with the broad and short English skull, are\r\ncommon even among the peasantry. The number of English Clan names\r\nnoticed by Mr. Kemble in the towns and villages of Sussex is 68 as\r\nagainst 60 in almost equally Teutonic Kent, 48 in Essex, 21 in largely\r\nCeltic Dorset, 6 in Cumberland, 2 in Cornwall, and none in Monmouth.\r\nThe size and number of the hundreds into which the county is divided\r\ntells us much the same tale. Each hundred was originally a group of one\r\nhundred free English families, settled on the soil, and holding in\r\ncheck the native subject population of Anglicised Celt-Euskarian\r\nchurls. Now, in Sussex we get 61 hundreds, and in Kent 61, as against\r\n13 in Surrey beyond the Weald (where the clan names also sink to 18),\r\nand 8 in Hertfordshire. Or, to put it another way, which I borrow from\r\nMr. Isaac Taylor, in Sussex there is one hundred to every 23 square\r\nmiles; in Kent to every 24; in Dorset to every 30; in Surrey to every\r\n58; in Herts to every 79; in Gloucester to every 97; in Derby to every\r\n162; in Warwick to every 179; and in Lancashire to every 302. In other\r\nwords, while in Kent, Sussex, and the east the free English inhabitants\r\nclustered thickly on the soil, with a relatively small servile\r\npopulation, in Mercia and the west the English population was much more\r\nsparsely scattered, with a relatively great servile population. So, as\r\nlate as the time of Domesday, in Kent and Sussex the slaves mentioned\r\nin the great survey (only a small part, probably, of the total)\r\nnumbered only 10 per cent. of the population, while in Devon and\r\nCornwall they numbered 20 per cent., and in Gloucestershire 33 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThese results are all inevitable. It is obvious that the first attacks\r\nmust necessarily be made upon the east and south coasts, and that the\r\ninland districts and the west must only slowly be conquered afterward.\r\nEspecially was it easy to found Teutonic kingdoms in the four isolated\r\nregions of Lincolnshire, East Anglia, Kent, and Sussex, each of which\r\nwas cut off from the rest of England in early times by impassable fens,\r\nmarshes, forests, or rivers. It was easy here to kill off the Welsh\r\nfighting population, to drive the remnants into the Fen Country or the\r\nWeald, to enslave the captives, the women, and the children, and to\r\nsecure the Teutonic colony by a mark or border of woodland, swamp, or\r\nhill. On the other hand, Wessex, Northumbria, and Mercia, with a vague\r\nand ill-defined internal border, had harder work to fight their way in\r\nagainst a united Welsh resistance; and it was only very slowly that\r\nthey pushed across the central watershed, to dismember the unconquered\r\nremnant of the Britons at last into the three isolated bodies of\r\nDamnonia (Cornwall and Devon), Wales Proper, and Strathclyde. This is\r\nprobably why the earliest settlements were made in these isolated coast\r\nregions, and why the inward progress of the other colonies was so\r\nrelatively slow.\r\n\r\nThe South Saxons, then, at first occupied the three fertile bits of the\r\ncounty--the coast belt of Sussex Proper, the Valley of the Ouse, and\r\nthe isolated Hastings district--because these were the best adapted for\r\ntheir strictly agricultural life. In spite of the legend of Ælle, I do\r\nnot suppose that they were all united from the first under a single\r\nprincipality. It seems far more probable that each little clan\r\nsettlement was at first wholly independent; that afterwards three\r\nlittle chieftainships grew up in the three fertile strips--typified,\r\nperhaps, by the story of Ælle's three sons--and that the whole finally\r\ncoalesced into a single kingdom of the South Saxons, which is the state\r\nin which we find the county in Bæda's time. As ever, its boundaries\r\nwere marked out for it by nature, for the Weald remained as yet an\r\nalmost unbroken forest; and the names of Selsea, Pevensey, Winchelsea,\r\nRomney, and many others, show by their common insular termination\r\n(found in all isles round the British coast, as in Sheppey, Walney,\r\nBardsea, Anglesea, Fursey, Wallasey, and so forth) that the marshland\r\nwas still wholly undrained, and that a few islands alone stood here and\r\nthere as masses of dry land out of their desolate and watery expanse.\r\nThe Hastings district, too, fell more naturally to Sussex than to Kent,\r\nbecause the marshes dividing it from the former were far less\r\nformidable than those which severed it from the latter. Most probably\r\nthe South Saxons intentionally aided nature in cutting off their\r\nterritory from all other parts of Britain; for every English kingdom\r\nloved to surround itself with a distinct mark or border of waste, as a\r\ndefence against invasion from outside. The Romans had brought Sussex\r\nwithin the great network of their road system; but the South Saxons no\r\ndoubt took special pains to cut off those parts of the roads which led\r\nacross their own frontier. At any rate, it is quite clear that Sussex\r\ndid not largely participate in the general life of the new England, and\r\nthat intercourse with the rest of the world was extremely limited.\r\n\r\nThe South Saxon kings probably lived for the most part at Chichester,\r\nthough no doubt they had _hams_, after the royal Teutonic fashion\r\ngenerally, in many other parts of their territory; and they moved about\r\nfrom one to the other, with their suite of thegns, eating up in each\r\nwhat food was provided by their serfs for their use, and then moving on\r\nto the next. The isolation of Sussex is strikingly shown by its long\r\nadherence to the primitive paganism. Missionaries from Rome, under the\r\nguidance of Augustine, converted Kent as early as 597. For Kent was the\r\nnearest kingdom to the continent; it contained the chief port of entry\r\nfor continental travellers, Richborough--the Dover of those days--and\r\nits king, accustomed to continental connections, had married a\r\nChristian Frankish princess from Paris. Hence Kent was naturally the\r\nfirst Teutonic principality to receive the faith. Next came\r\nNorthumbria, Lindsey, East Anglia, Wessex, and even inland Mercia. But\r\nSussex still held out for Thor and Woden as late as 679, three-quarters\r\nof a century after the conversion of Kent, and twenty years after\r\nMercia itself had given way to the new faith. Even when Sussex was\r\nfinally converted, the manner in which the change took place was\r\ncharacteristic. It was not by missionaries from beyond the Weald in\r\nKent or Surrey, nor from beyond the marsh in Wessex. An Irish monk,\r\nBæda tells us, coming ashore on the open coast near Chichester,\r\nestablished a small monastery at Bosham--even then, no doubt, a royal\r\n_ham_, as we know it was under Harold--'a place,' says the old\r\nhistorian significantly, 'girt round by sea and forest.' (It lies just\r\non the mark between Wessex and the South Saxons.) Æthelwealh, the\r\nking--a curious name, for it means 'noble Welshman' (perhaps he was of\r\nmixed blood)--had already been baptized in Mercia, and his wife was the\r\ndaughter of a Christian ealdorman of the Worcester-men; but the rest of\r\nthe principality was heathen. The Irish monk effected nothing; but\r\nshortly after Wilfrith, the fiery Bishop of York, on one of his usual\r\nflying visits to Rome, got shipwrecked off Selsea. With his accustomed\r\nvigour, he went ashore, and began a crusade in the heathen land. He was\r\nable at once to baptize the 'leaders and soldiers'--that is to say, the\r\nfree military English population; while his attendant priests--Eappa,\r\nPadda, Burghelm, and Oiddi (it is pleasant to preserve these little\r\npersonal touches)--proceeded to baptize the 'plebs'--that is to say,\r\nthe servile Anglicised Celt-Euskarian substratum--up and down the\r\ncountry villages.\r\n\r\nIt was to Wilfrith, too, that Sussex owed her first cathedral.\r\nÆthelwealh made him a present of Selsea, 'a place surrounded by the sea\r\non every side save one, where an isthmus about as broad as a\r\nstone's-throw connects it with the mainland,' and there the ardent\r\nbishop founded a regular monastery, in which he himself remained for\r\nfive years. On the soil were 250 serfs, whom Wilfrith at once set free.\r\nAfter the death of Aldhelm, the West Saxon bishop, in 709, Sussex was\r\nmade a separate bishopric, with its seat at Selsea; and it was not till\r\nafter the Norman Conquest that the cathedral was removed to Chichester.\r\nIt may be noted that all these arrangements were in strict accordance\r\nwith early English custom. The kings generally gave their bishops a\r\nseat near their own chief town, as Cuthbert had his see at Lindisfarne,\r\nclose to the royal Northumbrian capital of Bamborough; so that the\r\nproximity of Selsea to Chichester made it the most natural place for a\r\nbishopstool; and, again, it was usual to make over spots in the fens or\r\nmarshes to the monks, who, by draining and cultivating them, performed\r\na useful secular work. No traces now remain of old Selsea Cathedral,\r\nits site having long been swallowed up by incursions of the sea. Bæda\r\nhas the ordinary number of miracles to record in connection with the\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, however, the isolation of Sussex became less complete.\r\nÆthelwealh had got himself into complications with Wessex by accepting\r\nthe sovereignty of the Isle of Wight and the Meonwaras about\r\nSouthhampton from the hands of a Mercian conqueror. Perhaps Æthelwealh\r\nthen repaired the old Roman roads which led from his own _ham_ at\r\nChichester to Portsmouth in Wessex, and broke down the mark, so as to\r\nconnect his old and his new dominions with one another. At any rate,\r\nshortly after, Cædwalla, the West Saxon, an ætheling at large on the\r\nlook-out for a kingdom, attacked him suddenly with his host of thegns\r\nfrom this unexpected quarter, killed the King himself, and harried the\r\nSouth Saxons from marsh to marsh. Two South Saxons thegns expelled him\r\nfor a time, and made themselves masters of the country. But afterwards,\r\nCædwalla, becoming King of the West Saxons, recovered Sussex once more,\r\nand handed it on to his successor, Ini. Hence the South Saxons had no\r\nbishopric of their own during this period, but were included in the see\r\nof the West Saxons at Winchester.\r\n\r\nDuring the hundred years of the Mercian Supremacy, coincident, roughly\r\nspeaking, with the eighth century, we hear little of Sussex; but it\r\nseems to have shaken off the yoke of Wessex, and to have been in\r\nsubjection to the great Mercian over-lords alone. It had its own\r\nunder-kings and its own bishops. Early in the ninth century, however,\r\nwhen Ecgberht the West Saxon succeeding in throwing off the Mercian\r\nyoke, the other Saxon States of South Britain willingly joined him\r\nagainst the Anglian oppressors. 'The men of Kent and Surrey, Sussex and\r\nEssex, gladly submitted to King Ecgberht.' When the royal house of the\r\nSouth Saxons died out, Sussex still retained a sort of separate\r\nexistence within the West Saxon State, as Wales does in the England of\r\nour own day. Æthelwulf made his son under-king of Kent, Essex, Surrey,\r\nand Sussex; and so, during the troublous times of the Danish invasion,\r\nwhen all southern England became one in its resistance to the heathen,\r\nthose old principalities gradually sank into the position of provinces\r\nor shires.\r\n\r\nFrom the period of union with the general West Saxon Kingdom (which\r\ngrew slowly into the Kingdom of England under Eadgar and Cnut), the\r\nmarkland of the Weald seems to have been gradually encroached upon from\r\nthe south. Most of the names in that district are distinctly\r\n'Anglo-Saxon' in type; by which I mean that they were imposed before\r\nthe Norman Conquest, and belong to the stage of the language then in\r\nuse. Even during the Roman period, settlements for iron-mining existed\r\nin the Weald, and these clearings would of course be occupied by the\r\nEnglish colonists at a comparatively early time. Just at the foot of\r\nthe Downs, too, on the north side, we find a few clan settlements on\r\nthe edge of the Weald, which must date from the first period of English\r\ncolonisation. Such are Poynings, Didling, Ditchling, Chillington, and\r\nChiltington. Farther in, however, the clan names grow rarer; and where\r\nwe find them they are not _hams_ or _tuns_, regular communities of\r\nSaxon settlers, but they show, by their forestine terminations of\r\n_hurst_, _ley_, _den_, and _field_, that they were mere outlying\r\nshelters of hunters or swineherds in the trackless forest. Such are\r\nBillinghurst, Warminghurst, Itchingfield, and Ardingley. On the\r\nCuckmere river, the villages in the combes bear names like Jevington\r\nand Lullington; but in the upper valley of the little stream, where it\r\nflows through the Weald, we find instead Chiddingley and Hellingley.\r\nMost of the Weald villages, however, bear still more woodland\r\ntitles--Midhurst, Farnhurst, Nuthurst, Maplehurst, and Lamberhurst;\r\nCuckfield, Mayfield, Rotherfield, Hartfield, Heathfield, and\r\nWivelsfield; Crawley, Cowfold, Loxwood, Linchmere, and Marden. _Hams_\r\nand _tuns_, the sure signs of early English colonisation, are almost\r\nwholly lacking; in their place we get abundance of such names as\r\nConeyhurst Common, Water Down Forest, Hayward's Heath, Milland Marsh,\r\nand Bell's Oak Green. To this day even, the greater part of the Weald\r\nis down in park, copse, heath, forest, common, or marshland. Throughout\r\nthe whole expanse of the woodland region in Sussex, with the outlying\r\nportions in Kent, Surrey, and Hants, Mr. Isaac Taylor has collected no\r\nfewer than 299 local names with the significant forest terminations in\r\n_hurst_, _den_, _ley_, _holt_, and _field_. These facts show that,\r\nduring the later 'Anglo-Saxon' period, the Weald was being slowly\r\ncolonised in a few favourable spots. Its use as a mark was now gone,\r\nand it might be safely employed for the peaceful purposes of the archer\r\nand the swineherd. Names referring to pasture and the wild beasts are\r\ntherefore common.\r\n\r\nTo the same time must doubtless be assigned the exact delimitation of\r\nthe Sussex frontiers. During the early periods, the Kentings, the\r\nSuthrige, and the West Saxons would all extend on their side as far as\r\nthe Weald, which would be treated as a sort of neutral zone. But when\r\nthe Woodland itself began to be occupied, a demarcation would naturally\r\nbe made between the neighbouring provinces. The boundary follows the\r\nmost obvious course. It starts on the east from the old mouth of the\r\nRother (now diverted to Rye New Harbour), known as the Kent Ditch, in\r\nwhat was then the central and most impassable part of the marshland. It\r\nruns along the Rother to its bifurcation, and then makes for the\r\nheaven-water-parting or dividing back of the Forest Ridge, beside two\r\nor three lesser streams. Then it passes along the crest of the ridge\r\nfrom Tunbridge Wells, past East Grinstead and Crawley, till it strikes\r\nthe Hampshire border. There it follows the line between the two\r\nwatersheds to the sea, which it reaches at Emsworth. There is, however,\r\none long insulated spur of Hampshire running down from Haslemere to\r\nGraffham (in apparent defiance of geographical features), whose origin\r\nand meaning I do not understand.\r\n\r\nWith the Norman Conquest, the history of Sussex, and of England\r\ngenerally, for the most part ceases abruptly; all the rest is mere\r\npersonal gossip about Prince Edward and the battle of Lewes, or about\r\nGeorge IV. and the Brighton Pavilion. Not, of course, that there is not\r\nreal national history here as elsewhere; but it is hard to disentangle\r\nfrom the puerile personalities of historians generally. Nevertheless,\r\nsome brief attempt to reconstruct the main facts in the subsequent\r\nhistory of Sussex must still be undertaken. The part which Sussex bore\r\npassively in the actual Conquest is itself typical of the new\r\nrelations. England was getting drawn into the general run of European\r\ncivilisation, and the old isolation of Sussex was beginning to be\r\nbroken down. Lying so near the Continent, Sussex was naturally the\r\nlanding-place for an army coming from Normandy or Ponthieu. William's\r\nfleet came ashore on the low coast at Pevensey. Naturally he turned\r\ntowards Hastings, whence a road now led through the Weald to London. On\r\nthe tall cliffs he threw up an earthwork, and then marched towards the\r\ngreat town. Harold's army met him on the heights of Senlac, part of the\r\nsolitary ridge between the marshes, by which alone London could be\r\nreached. Harold fell on the spot now marked by the ruined high altar of\r\nBattle Abbey--a national monument at present in the keeping of an\r\nEnglish duke. Once the native army was routed, William marched on\r\nresistlessly to London, and Sussex and England were at his feet.\r\n\r\nThe new feudal organisation of the county is doubtless shadowed forth\r\nin the existing rapes. Of these there are six, called respectively\r\nafter Chichester, Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey, and Hastings. It\r\nwill be noticed at once that these were the seats of the new bishopric\r\nand of the five great early castles. In one form or another, more or\r\nless modernised, Arundel Castle, Bramber Castle, Lewes Castle, Pevensey\r\nCastle, and Hastings Castle all survive to our own day. In accordance\r\nwith their ordinary policy of removing cathedrals from villages to\r\nchief towns, and so concentrating the civil and ecclesiastical\r\ngovernment, the Normans brought the bishopstool from Selsea to\r\nChichester. The six rapes are fairly coincident--Chichester with the\r\nmarsh district; Arundel with the dale of Arun; Bramber with the dale of\r\nAdur; Lewes with the western dale of Ouse; Pevensey with the eastern\r\ndale of Ouse; and Hastings with the insulated region between the\r\nmarshes. In other words, Sussex seems to have been cut up into six\r\nnatural divisions along the sea-shore; while to each division was\r\nassigned all the Weald back of its own shore strip as far as the\r\nborder. Thus the rapes consist of six long longitudinal belts, each\r\nwith a short sea front and a long stretch back into the Weald.\r\n\r\nIncreased intercourse with the Continent brought the Cinque Ports into\r\nimportance; and, as premier Cinque Port, Hastings grew to be one of the\r\nchief towns in Sussex. The constant French wars made them prominent in\r\nmediæval history. As trade grew up, other commercial harbours gave rise\r\nto considerable mercantile towns. Rye and Winchelsea, at the mouth of\r\nthe Rother, were great ports of entry from France as late as the days\r\nof Elizabeth. Seaford, at the mouth of the Ouse, was also an important\r\nharbour till 1570, when a terrible storm changed the course of the\r\nstream to the town called from that fact Newhaven. Lewes was likewise a\r\nport, as the estuary of the Ouse was navigable from the mouth up to the\r\ntown. Brighthelmstone was still a village; but old Shoreham on the Adur\r\nwas a considerable place. Arundel Haven and Chichester Harbour recalls\r\nthe old mercantile importance of their respective neighbourhoods. The\r\nonly other places of any note in mediæval Sussex were Steyning, under\r\nthe walls of Bramber Castle; Hurstmonceux, which the Conqueror bestowed\r\nupon the lord of Eu; Battle, where he planted his great expiatory\r\nabbey; and Hurst Pierpont, which also dates from William's own time.\r\nThe sole important part of the county was still the strip along the\r\ncoast between the Weald and the sea.\r\n\r\nDuring the Plantagenet period, England became a wool-exporting country,\r\nlike Australia at the present day; and therefore the wool-growing parts\r\nof the island rose quickly into great importance. Sussex, with its\r\nlarge expanse of chalk downs, naturally formed one of the best\r\nwool-producing tracts; and in the reign of Edward III., Chichester was\r\nmade one of the 'staples' to which the wool trade was confined by\r\nstatute. Sussex Proper and the Lewes valley were now among the most\r\nthickly populated regions of England.\r\n\r\nThe Weald, too, was beginning to have its turn. English iron was\r\ngetting to be in request for the cannon, armour, and arms required in\r\nthe French wars; and nowhere was iron more easily procured, side by\r\nside with the fuel for smelting it, than in the Sussex Weald. From the\r\ndays of the Edwards to the early part of the eighteenth century, the\r\nwoods of the Weald were cut down in quantities for the iron works.\r\nDuring this time, several small towns began to spring up in the old\r\nforest region, of which the chief are Midhurst, Petworth, Billinghurst,\r\nHorsham, Cuckfield, and East Grinstead. Many of the deserted\r\nsmelting-places may still be seen, with their invariable accompaniment\r\nof a pond or dam. The wood supply began to fail as early as Elizabeth's\r\nreign, but iron was still smelted in 1760. From that time onward, the\r\ncompetition of Sheffield and Birmingham--where iron was prepared by the\r\n'new method' with coal--blew out the Sussex furnaces, and the Weald\r\nrelapsed once more into a wild heather-clad and wood-covered region,\r\nnow thickly interspersed with parks and country seats, of which\r\nPetworth, Cowdry, and Ashburnham are the best known.\r\n\r\nModern times, of course, have brought their changes. With the northward\r\nrevolution caused by steam and coal, Sussex, like the rest of southern\r\nEngland, has fallen back to a purely agricultural life. The sea has\r\nblocked up the harbours of Rye, Winchelsea, Seaford, and Lewes. Man's\r\nhand has drained the marshes of the Rother, of Pevensey, and of Selsea\r\nBill; and railways have broken down the isolation of Sussex from the\r\nremainder of the country. Still, as of old, the natural configuration\r\ncontinues to produce its necessary effects. Even now there are no towns\r\nof any size in the Weald: few, save Lewes, Arundel, and Chichester,\r\nanywhere but on the coast. The Downs are given up to sheep-farming; the\r\nWeald to game and pleasure-grounds; the shore to holiday-making. The\r\nproximity to London is now the chief cause of Sussex prosperity. In the\r\nold coaching days, Brighton was a foregone conclusion. Sixty miles by\r\nroad from town, it was the nearest accessible spot by the seaside. As\r\nsoon as people began to think of annual holidays, Brighton must\r\nnecessarily attract them. Hence George IV. and the Pavilion. The\r\nrailroad has done more. It has made Brighton into a suburb, and raised\r\nits population to over 100,000. At the same time, the South Coast line\r\nhas begotten watering-places at Worthing, Bognor, and Littlehampton. In\r\nthe other direction, it has created Eastbourne. Those who do not love\r\nchalk (as the Georges did), choose rather the more broken and wooded\r\ncountry round Hastings and St. Leonards, where the Weald sandstone runs\r\ndown to the sea. The difference between the rounded Downs and\r\nsaucer-shaped combes of the chalk, and the deep glens traversing the\r\nsoft friable strata of the Wealden, is well seen in passing from Beachy\r\nHead to Ecclesbourne and Fairlight. Shoreham is kept half alive by the\r\nBrighton coal trade: Newhaven struggles on as a port for Dieppe. But as\r\na whole, the county is now one vast seaside resort from end to end, so\r\nthat to-day the flat coasts at Selsea, Pevensey, and Rye, are alone\r\nleft out in the cold. The iron trade and the wool trade have long since\r\ngone north to the coal districts. Brighton and Hastings sum up in\r\nthemselves all that is vital in the Sussex of 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE BRONZE AXE.\r\n\r\nThere is always a certain fascination in beginning a subject at the\r\nwrong end and working backward: it has the charm which inevitably\r\nattaches to all evil practices; you know you oughtn't, and so you can't\r\nresist the temptation to outrage the proprieties and do it. I can't\r\nmyself resist the temptation of beginning this article where it ought\r\nto break off--with Chinese money, which is not the origin, but the\r\nfinal outcome and sole remaining modern representative of that antique\r\nand almost prehistoric implement, the Bronze Age hatchet.\r\n\r\nImprobable and grotesque as this affiliation sounds at first hearing,\r\nit is, nevertheless, about as certain as any other fact in\r\nanthropological science--which isn't, perhaps, saying a great deal. The\r\nfamiliar little brass cash, with the square hole for stringing them\r\ntogether on a thread in the centre, well known to the frequenter of\r\nminor provincial museums, are, strange to say, the lineal descendants,\r\nin unbroken order, of the bronze axe of remote Celestial ancestors.\r\nFrom the regular hatchet to the modern coin one can trace a distinct,\r\nif somewhat broken, succession, so that it is impossible to say where\r\nthe one leaves off and the other begins--where the implement merges\r\ninto the medium of exchange, and settles down finally into the root of\r\nall evil.\r\n\r\nHere is how this curious pedigree first worked itself out. In early\r\ntimes, before coin was invented, barter was usually conducted between\r\nproducer and consumer with metal implements, as it still is in Central\r\nAfrica at the present day with Venetian glass beads and rolls of red\r\ncalico. Payments were all made in kind, and bronze was the commonest\r\nform of specie. A gentleman desirous of effecting purchases in foreign\r\nparts went about the world with a number of bronze axes in his pocket\r\n(or its substitute), which he exchanged for other goods with the native\r\ntraffickers in the country where he did his primitive business. At\r\nfirst, the early Chinese in that unsophisticated age were content to\r\nuse real hatchets for this commercial purpose; but, after a time, with\r\nthe profound mercantile instinct of their race, it occurred to some of\r\nthem that when a man wanted half a hatchet's worth of goods he might as\r\nwell pay for them with half a hatchet. Still, as it would be a pity to\r\nspoil a good working implement by cutting it in two, the worthy Ah Sin\r\ningeniously compromised the matter by making thin hatchets, of the\r\nusual size and shape, but far too slender for practical usage. By so\r\ndoing he invented coin: and, what is more, he invented it far earlier\r\nthan the rival claimants to that proud distinction, the Lydians, whose\r\nelectrum staters were first struck in the seventh century, B.C. But,\r\naccording to Professor Terrien de la Couperie, some of the fancy\r\nChinese hatchets which we still retain date back as far as the year\r\n1000 (a good round number), and are so thin that they could only have\r\nbeen intended to possess exchange value. And when a distinguished\r\nSinologist gives us a date for anything Chinese, it behoves the rest of\r\nthe unlearned world to open its mouth and shut its eyes, and thankfully\r\nreceive whatever the distinguished Sinologist may send it.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh century, then, these mercantile axes, made in the\r\nstrictest sense to sell and not to use, were stamped with an official\r\nstamp to mark their amount, and became thereby converted into true\r\ncoins--that was the root of the 'root of all evil.' Thence the\r\ndeclension to the 'cash' is easy; the form grew gradually more and more\r\nregular, while the square hole in the centre, once used for the handle,\r\nwas retained by conservatism and practical sense as a convenient means\r\nof stringing them together.\r\n\r\nSo this was the end of the old bronze hatchet, perhaps the most\r\nwonderful civilizing agent ever invented by human ingenuity. Let us\r\nhark back now, and from the opposite side see what was its first\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n'But why,' you ask, 'the most wonderful civilizing agency? What did the\r\nbronze axe ever do for humanity?' Well, nearly everything. I believe I\r\nhave really not said too much. We are apt to talk big nowadays about\r\nthe steam-engine, and that marvellous electricity which is always going\r\nto do wonders for us all--to-morrow; but I don't know whether either\r\never produced so great a revolution in human life, or so completely\r\nmetamorphosed human existence, as that simple and commonplace bronze\r\nhatchet.\r\n\r\nFor, consider that before the days of bronze man knew no weapon or\r\nimplement of any sort save the stone axe, or tomahawk, and the\r\nflint-tipped arrow. Consider, that the highest stage of human culture\r\nhe had then reached was hardly higher than that of the scalp-hunting\r\nRed Indian or the seal-spearing Esquimaux. Consider, that in his Stone\r\nAge agriculture and grains were almost unknown--the forest uncleared,\r\nthe soil untilled, and hunting and fishing the sole or principal human\r\nactivities. It was the bronze axe that first enabled man to make\r\nclearings in the woodland on the large scale, and to sow on those\r\nclearings in good big fields the wheat and barley which determined the\r\nfirst great upward step in the drama of civilization. All these things\r\ndepend in ultimate analysis upon that pioneer of culture, the bronze\r\nhatchet.\r\n\r\nAnd how did the first Watt or Edison of metallurgy come to make that\r\nearliest bronze implement? Well, it seems probable that between the\r\nStone Age and the Bronze Age there intervened everywhere, or nearly\r\neverywhere, a very short and transient age of copper. And the reason\r\nfor thus thinking is threefold. In the first place, bronze is an alloy\r\nof tin and copper: and it seems natural to suppose that men would use\r\nthe simple metals in isolation to begin with, before they discovered\r\nthat they could harden and temper them by mixing the two together. In\r\nthe second place, copper occurs in the pure or native state (without\r\nthe trouble of smelting) in several countries, and was therefore a very\r\nnatural metal for early man to cast his inquiring glance upon. And in\r\nthe third place, weapons of unmixed copper, apparently of very antique\r\ntypes, have been found in various parts of the world, both in Asia and\r\nAmerica. According to Mr. John Evans, the most learned historian of the\r\nBronze Age, the greatest copper 'find' of the eastern hemisphere was\r\nthat at Gungeria, in Central India; and the copper implements there\r\nfound consisted entirely of flat celts of a very early and almost\r\nprimitive pattern.\r\n\r\nThe copper weapons of America, however, have greater illustrative and\r\nethnological interest, because the noble red man, at the period when\r\nColumbus first discovered him, and when he first discovered Columbus,\r\nwas still in the Stone Age of his very imperfect culture, or, to speak\r\nmore correctly, of extreme barbarism. The fact is, the Indians of Lake\r\nSuperior were only just beginning to employ copper, and were on the eve\r\nof independently inaugurating a Bronze Age of their own, when the\r\nintrusive white man came and spoiled the fun by the incontinent\r\nintroduction of iron, firearms, missionaries, whisky, and all the other\r\nresources of civilization. On the shores of Lake Superior native copper\r\nexists in abundance; and the intelligent Red Indian, finding this\r\nhandsome red stone in the cliffs by his side, was pretty sure to try\r\nhis hand at chipping a tomahawk out of the rare material. But, as soon\r\nas he did so, Mr. Evans suggests, he would find to his surprise that it\r\nyielded to his blows; in short, that he had got that singular\r\nphenomenon, a malleable stone, to deal with. Hammering away at his new\r\ninvention, he must shortly have hammered it into a shapely axe. The new\r\nprocess took his practical fancy at once: vistas of an untold wealth of\r\nscalps floated gaily before his fevered brain; and he proceeded to\r\nhammer himself various weapons and implements without delay. Amongst\r\nothers, he produced for himself very neat spear-heads, with sockets\r\nadapted for the reception of a shaft, made by hammering out the base\r\nflat, and then turning over the edges so as to enclose the wood between\r\nthem, like a modern hoe-handle. In Wisconsin alone more than a hundred\r\nof such copper axes, spear-heads, and knives have been unearthed by\r\nantiquaries and duly recorded.\r\n\r\nAll these weapons, however, are simply hammered, not cast or melted.\r\nThe Red Indian hadn't yet reached the stage of making a mould when De\r\nChamplain and his _voyageurs_ came down upon Canada and interrupted\r\nthis interesting experiment in industrial development by springing the\r\nseventeenth century upon the unsophisticated red man at one fell blow,\r\nwith all its inherited wealth of European science. Nevertheless, the\r\nIndians must have known that fire melted copper; for the heat of the\r\naltars was great enough, say Squier and Davis, to fuse the implements\r\nand ornaments laid upon them in sacrificial rites; and so the fact of\r\nits fusibility could hardly have escaped them. A people who had\r\nadvanced so far on the road towards the invention of casting could\r\nhardly have been prevented from taking the final step, save by the\r\nsudden intervention of some social cataclysm like the European invasion\r\nof Eastern America. And how awful a calamity that was for the Indians\r\nthemselves we at this day can hardly even realize.\r\n\r\nIn some similar way, no doubt, the Asiatic people who first invented\r\nbronze must have learned the fact of the fusibility of metals, and have\r\napplied it in time, at first, perhaps, by accident, to the manufacture\r\nof that hard alloy. I say Asiatic, because there seems good reason to\r\nbelieve that Asia was the original home of the nascent bronze industry.\r\nFor a Bronze Age almost necessarily implies a brief preceding age of\r\ncopper; and there is no proof of pure copper implements ever having\r\nbeen largely used in Europe, while there is ample proof of their having\r\nbeen used to a very considerable extent in Asia. Hence we may\r\nreasonably infer that the art of bronze-making was developed in Asia by\r\na copper-using people, and that when metallurgy was first introduced\r\ninto Europe the method of mixing the copper with tin had already been\r\nperfected. The abundance of tin in the south-eastern islands of Asia\r\nrenders this view probable; while in Europe there are no tin mines\r\nworth mentioning, except in the remotest part of a remote outlying\r\nisland--to wit, in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the earliest and simplest forms of bronze axe with\r\nwhich we are acquainted are profoundly interesting, as casting a flood\r\nof light upon the general process of human evolution all the world\r\nover. Every new human invention is always at first directly modelled\r\nupon the other similar products which have preceded it. There is no\r\nreally new thing under the sun. For example, the earliest English\r\nrailway carriages were built on the model of the old stage-coach, only\r\nthat three stage-coaches, as it were, were telescoped together, side by\r\nside--the very first bore the significant motto, _Tria juncta in\r\nuno_--and it was this preconception of the English coachbuilder that\r\nhas hampered us ever since with our hateful 'compartments,' instead of\r\nthe commodious and comfortable open American saloon carriages. So, too,\r\nthe earliest firearms were modelled on the stock of the old cross-bow,\r\nand the earliest earthenware pots and pans were shaped like the still\r\nmore primitive gourds and calabashes. It need not surprise us,\r\ntherefore, to find that the earliest metal axes of which we have any\r\nknowledge were directly moulded on the original shape of the stone\r\ntomahawk.\r\n\r\nSuch a copper hatchet, cast in a mould formed by a polished neolithic\r\nstone celt, was found in an early Etruscan tomb, and is still preserved\r\nin the Museum at Berlin. See how natural this process would be. For, in\r\nthe first place, the primitive workman, knowing already only one form\r\nof axe, the stone tomahawk, would naturally reproduce it in the new\r\nmaterial, without thinking what improvements in shape and design the\r\nmalleability and fusibility of the metal would render possible or easy.\r\nBut, more than that, the idea of coating the polished stone axe with\r\nplastic clay, and thereby making a mould for the molten metal, would be\r\nso very simple that even the neolithic savage, already accustomed to\r\nthe manufacture of coarse pottery upon natural shapes, could hardly\r\nfail to think of it. As a matter of fact, he did think of it: for celts\r\nof bronze or copper, cast in moulds made from stone hatchets, have been\r\nfound in Cyprus by General di Cesnola, on the site of Troy by Dr.\r\nSchliemann, and in many other assorted localities by less distinguished\r\nbut equally trustworthy archæologists.\r\n\r\nTo the neolithic hunter, herdsman, and villager this progress from the\r\nstone to the metal axe probably seemed at first a mere substitution of\r\nan easier for a more difficult material. He little knew whither his\r\ndiscovery tended. It was pure human laziness that urged the change. How\r\nnice to save yourself all that long trouble of chipping and polishing,\r\nwith ceaseless toil, in favour of a stone which you could melt at one\r\ngo and pour while hot into a ready-made mould! It must have looked, by\r\ncomparison, like weapon-making by magic; for properly to cut and polish\r\na stone axe is the work of weeks and weeks of elbow-grease. Yet here,\r\nin a moment, a better hatchet could be turned out all finished! But the\r\nimplied effects lay deeper far than the neolithic hunter could ever\r\nhave imagined. The bronze axe was the beginning of civilization; it\r\nbrought the steam-engine, the telephone, woman's rights, and the county\r\ncouncillor directly in its train. With the eye of faith, had he only\r\npossessed that useful optical organ, the Stone Age artizan might\r\ndoubtless have beheld Pears' soap and the deceased wife's sister\r\nlooming dimly in the remote future. Till that moment human life had\r\nbeen almost stationary: thenceforth, it proceeded by leaps and bounds,\r\nlike a kangaroo society, on its upward path towards triumphant\r\ndemocracy and the penny post. The nineteenth century and all its wiles\r\nhung by a thread upon the success of his melting pot.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the whole history of human civilization has been one of a\r\nconstantly accelerated progress. The Older Stone Age, when men knew\r\nonly how to chip flint implements, but hadn't yet invented the art of\r\ngrinding and polishing them, was one of immense and incalculable\r\nduration, to be reckoned perhaps by tens of thousands of years--some\r\nbold chronologists would even suggest by hundreds of thousands.\r\nImprovement there was, to be sure, during all that long epoch of slow\r\ndevelopment; but it was improvement at a snail's pace. The very rude\r\nchipped axes of the naked drift age give way after thousands and\r\nthousands of years to the shapelier chipped lances, javelins, and\r\narrowheads of the skin-clad cavemen. M. Gabriel de Mortillet, indeed,\r\nmost indefatigable of theorists, has even pointed out four stages of\r\nculture, marked by four different types of weapons, into which he\r\nsubdivides the Older Stone Age. Yet vast epochs elapsed before some\r\nprehistoric Stephenson or dusky Morse first, half by accident, smote\r\nout the idea of grinding his tomahawk smooth to a sharp cutting edge,\r\ninstead of merely chipping it sharp, and so initiated the Neolithic\r\nPeriod. This Neolithic Period itself, again, was immensely long as\r\ncompared with the Bronze Age which followed, though short by comparison\r\nwith the Palæolithic epoch which preceded it. Then the Bronze Age saw\r\nenormous changes come faster and faster, till the use of iron still\r\nfurther accelerated the rate of progress. For each new improvement\r\nbecomes, in turn, the parent of yet newer triumphs, so that at last, as\r\nin the present day, a single century sees vaster changes in the world\r\nof man than whole ages before it have done in far longer intervals.\r\n\r\nBut the invention of bronze, or, in other words, the introduction of\r\nhard metal, was really perhaps the very greatest epoch of all, the most\r\ndistinct turning-point in the whole history of humanity. True, some\r\nbeginnings of civilisation were already found in the Newer Stone Age.\r\nMan did not then live by slaughter alone. Hand-made pottery and rude\r\ntissues of flax are found in neolithic lake dwellings in Switzerland.\r\nAgriculture was already practised in a feeble way on small open\r\nclearings, cautiously cleaved with fire or hewn with the tomahawk in\r\nthe native forests. The cow, the sheep, and the goat were more or less\r\ndomesticated, though the horse was yet riderless; and the pastoral had\r\ntherefore, to some extent, superseded the pure hunting stage. But what\r\ninroad could the stone hatchet make unaided upon the virgin forests of\r\nthose remote days? The neolithic clearing must have been a mere stray\r\noasis in a desert of woodland, like the villages of the New Guinea\r\nsavages at the present day, lying few and far between among vast\r\nstretches of primæval forest.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of bronze, everything was different; and the difference\r\nshowed itself with extraordinary rapidity. One may compare the\r\nrevolution effected by bronze in the early world, indeed, with the\r\nrevolution effected by railways in our own time; only the neolithic\r\nworld had been so very simple a one that the change was perhaps even\r\nmore marvellous in its suddenness and its comprehensiveness. Metal\r\nitself implied metal-working; and metal-working brought about, not only\r\nthe arts of smelting and casting, but also endless incidental arts of\r\ndesign and decoration. The bronze hatchets, for example, to take our\r\ntypical implement, begin by being mere copies of the stone originals;\r\nbut, as time goes on, they acquire rapidly innumerable improvements.\r\nFirst, metal is economized in the upper part which fits into the\r\nhandle, while the lower or cutting edge is widened out sideways, so as\r\nto form an elegant and gracefully curved outline for the whole\r\nimplement. Next come the flanged axes, with projecting ledges on either\r\nside; and then the palstaves with loops and ribs, each marking some new\r\nimprovement in the character of the weapon, which the inventor would no\r\ndoubt have patented but for the unfortunate fact that patents were as\r\nyet wholly unknown to Bronze Age humanity. Later still come the\r\nsocketed hatchets of many patterns, with endless ingenious little\r\ndevices for securing some small advantage to the special manufacturer.\r\nI can fancy the Bronze Age smith showing them off with pride to his\r\ninterested customers: 'These are our own patterns--the newest thing out\r\nin bronze axes; observe the advantage you gain from the ribs and\r\npellets, and the peculiar character which the octagonal socket gives to\r\nthe hafting!' Indeed, in this single department of bronze celts alone,\r\nMr. Evans in his great monumental work figures over a hundred and\r\neighty distinct specimens (out of thousands known), each one presenting\r\nsome well-marked advance in type upon its predecessor. There is almost\r\na Yankee ingenuity of design in many of the dodges thus registered for\r\nour inspection.\r\n\r\nMany of the celts, I may add, are most beautifully decorated with\r\ngeometrical patterns, some of which belong to a very high order of\r\nornamental art. This is still more the case with the daggers, swords,\r\nand defensive armour, often intended for the use of great chieftains,\r\nand executed with an amount of taste and feeling long since dead among\r\nthe degenerate workmen of our iron age.\r\n\r\nBut the indirect effects of the introduction of metal working were far\r\nmore interesting and important in their way than the direct effects.\r\nWith bronze began the great age of agriculture, of commerce, and of\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nOf agriculture first, because the bronze hatchet enabled men to make\r\nsuch openings in the forest as neolithic man had never ever dreamed of.\r\nFor the first time in the history of our race, whole tracts of country\r\nat once began to be cleared and cultivated. Stone Age tillage was the\r\ntillage of tiny plots in the forest's depths; Bronze Age tillage was\r\nthe tillage of fields and wide open spaces in the champaign country.\r\nThe Stone Age knew no specials implements of agriculture as such; its\r\ntomahawk was indiscriminately applied to all purposes alike of war or\r\ngardening. You scalped your enemy with it, or you cut up your dinner,\r\nor you dug your field, or you planted your seed-corn, according as\r\ntaste or circumstances directed. But while the Bronze Age men had axes\r\nto hew down the wood, they had also sickles and reaping-hooks to cut\r\ntheir crops, and a sort of hoe or scraper to till the soil with.\r\nSpecialisation reached a very high pitch. All the remains of the Bronze\r\nAge show us an agricultural people by no means idyllic in their habits\r\nto be sure, and not all disposed to join the Peace Preservation\r\nSociety, but cultivating large stretches of wheat or barley, grinding\r\ntheir meal in regular mills, and possessed of implements of\r\nconsiderable diversity, some of which I shall proceed to notice later.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of commerce and of navigation are equally obvious. Bronze\r\nitself consists of tin and copper: and there are only two parts of the\r\nworld from which tin in any large quantities can be procured--namely,\r\nCornwall and the Malay Archipelago. The very existence of bronze,\r\ntherefore, necessarily implies the existence of a sea-going trade in\r\ntin, for which some corresponding benefits must of course have been\r\noffered by the early purchaser. As a matter of fact, we know with some\r\nprobability that it was Cornish tin which first tempted the Phoenicians\r\nout of the inland sea, past the Pillars of Hercules, to brave the\r\nterrors of the open Atlantic. Long before the days of such advanced\r\nnavigation, however, the Cornish tin was transported by land across the\r\nwhole breadth of Southern Britain and shipped for the Continent from\r\nthe Isle of Thanet. A very old trackway runs along the crest of the\r\nDowns from the West Country to Kent, known now as the Pilgrim's Way,\r\nbecause it was followed in far later times by mediæval wayfarers from\r\nSomerset and Dorset to the shrine of St. Thomas à Becket at Canterbury.\r\nBut Mr. Charles Elton has shown conclusively that the Pilgrim's Way is\r\nmany centuries more ancient than the martyr of King Henry's epoch, and\r\nthat it was used in the Bronze Age for the transport of tin from the\r\nmines in Cornwall to the port of Sandwich. To this day antique ingots\r\nof the valuable metal are often dug up in hoards or finds along the\r\nline of the ancient track. They were evidently buried there in fear and\r\ntrembling, long ages since, in what Indian _voyageurs_ still call a\r\n_cache_, by caravans hurriedly surprised by the enemy; and owing to the\r\nunfortunate accident of the possessors all getting killed off in the\r\nensuing fray, the ingots have been left undisturbed for centuries for\r\nthe benefit of antiquaries at the present time. 'It's an ill wind that\r\nblows nobody good.' Probably the inhabitants of Herculaneum and Pompeii\r\nhad very little notion what valuable relics their bodies and houses\r\nwould prove in the end for curious posterity.\r\n\r\nThe converse evidence of a return trade in other goods is no less\r\nstriking. Not only are articles in amber found in Bronze Age tombs all\r\nover Europe (though the gum itself belongs to the Baltic and the North\r\nSea alone), but also gold objects of southern workmanship occur in\r\nBritish barrows; while sometimes even ivory from Africa is noticed in\r\nthe inlaid handles of some Welsh or Brigantian chieftain's sword. Glass\r\nbeads were likewise imported into Britain, as were also ornaments of\r\nEgyptian porcelain. In fact, the Bronze Age clearly marks for us the\r\nperiod when trade routes extended in every direction from the\r\nMediterranean, north and south, and when the world began to be\r\ncommercially solidified by a primitive theory of foreign exchange. It\r\nis a little odd that the basis of all this traffic was tin, and that we\r\nstill use the name of that same metal as a brief equivalent for coin in\r\ngeneral: but persons of serious economical or philological intelligence\r\nare particularly requested not to enter into grave correspondence with\r\nthe author of this paper on any possible levity which they may detect\r\nlurking in this innocent remark.\r\n\r\nSome small idea of the rapid advance in civilization which marked the\r\nBronze Age may perhaps be formed from a brief enumeration of the\r\nprincipal classes of remains which have come down to us intact from\r\nthat first epoch of metal. Besides all the various celts, hatchets, and\r\nadzes, whose name is legion, and whose patterns are manifold, many\r\nother tools or implements occur abundantly in the barrows or _caches_.\r\nChisels, either plain, tanged, with lugs, or socketed; gouges, hammers,\r\nanvils, and tongs; punches, awls, drills, and prickers; tweezers,\r\nneedles, fish-hooks, and weights; all these are found by dozens in\r\nendless variety of design. Knives are common, and the vanity of Bronze\r\nAge man made him even put up without a murmur with the pangs of shaving\r\nwith a bronze razor. Daggers and rapiers naturally abound, many of them\r\nof rare and beautiful workmanship. Halberds turn up less frequently,\r\nbut swords are abundant, and are sometimes tastefully decorated with\r\ngold or ivory. Even the scabbards sometimes survive, while the shields,\r\nadorned with concentric rings or with knobs and bosses, would put to\r\nshame the rank and file of cheap modern metal work. Nay, the very\r\ntrumpets which sounded the onset often lie buried by the warrior's\r\nside, and the bells which adorned his horse's neck bring back to us\r\nvividly the Homeric pictures of Bronze Age warfare.\r\n\r\nThe private life of Bronze Age man and his correlative wife is\r\nillustrated for us by another great group of more strictly personal\r\nrelics. There are pins simple and pins of the infantile safety-pin\r\norder: there are brooches which might be worn by modern ladies, and\r\near-rings so huge that even modern ladies would in all probability\r\nobject to wearing them, unless, indeed, a princess or an actress made\r\nthem the fashion. The torques, or necklets, are among the best known\r\nmale decorations, and are still famous in Ireland, where Malachi\r\n(whoever he may have been) wore the collar of gold which he tore from\r\nthe proud invader. Many of the bracelets are extremely beautiful; but,\r\nstrange to say, as if on purpose to spite the common prejudice about\r\nthe degeneracy of modern man, they are all so small in girth as to\r\nbetoken a race with arms and legs hardly any bigger than the Finns or\r\nLaplanders. Of the clasps, buttons, and buckles I will say nothing\r\nhere. I have enumerated enough to suggest to even the most casual\r\nobserver the vastness of the revolution which the Bronze Age wrought in\r\nthe mode of life and the civilisation of ancient man.\r\n\r\nBronze found our early ancestor, in fact, a half-developed savage: it\r\nleft him a semi-civilized Homeric Greek. It came in upon a world of\r\nskin-clad hunters and fishers: it went out upon a world of Phoenician\r\nnavigators, Egyptian architects, Achæan poets, and Roman soldiers. And\r\nall this wide difference was wrought in a period of some eight or ten\r\ncenturies at the outside, almost entirely by the advent of the simple\r\nbronze axe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE ISLE OF RUIM.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have never heard its name before; yet in the earlier ages\r\nof this kingdom of Britain, Ruim Isle, rising dim through the mist of\r\nprehistoric oceans, was once in its own way famous and important.\r\n\r\nOff the old and obliterated south-eastern promontory of our island,\r\nwhere the land of Kent shelved almost imperceptibly into the Wantsum\r\nStrait, Ruim Island--the Holm of the Headland--stood out with its white\r\nwall of broken cliffs into the German Sea. The greater part of it\r\nconsisted of gorse-clad chalk down, the last subsiding spur of that\r\ngreat upland range which, starting from the central boss of Salisbury\r\nPlain, runs right across the face of Surrey and Kent, and, bifurcating\r\nnear Canterbury, falls sheer into the sea at the end of either fork by\r\nRamsgate or Dover. But in earlier days Ruim Isle was not joined as now\r\nby flats and marshes to the adjacent mainland; the chalk dipped under\r\nthe open Wantsum Strait, much as the chalk of Hampshire dips to-day\r\nunder the Solent Sea, and reappeared again on the other side in the\r\nThanet Downs, as it reappears in the Isle of Wight at the ridge of St.\r\nBoniface and the central hills about Newport and Carisbrooke. For now\r\nthe murder indeed is out, and you have discovered already that\r\nRuim--his dim, mysterious Ruim--is only just the commonplace,\r\nvulgarized Isle of Thanet.\r\n\r\nStill, it is not without cause that I have ventured to call it by that\r\nstrange and now almost forgotten old-world name. There is reason, we\r\nknow, in the roasting of eggs, and, if I have gone out of my way to\r\nintroduce the ancient isle to you by its title of Ruim, it is in order\r\nthat we might start clear of the odour of tea and shrimps, the\r\nartificial niggers, and cheap excursionists, that the name of Thanet\r\nbrings up most prominently at the present day before the travelled mind\r\nof the modern Londoner. I want to carry you back to a time when\r\nRamsgate was still but a green gap in the long line of chalk cliff, and\r\nMargate but the chine of a little trickling streamlet that tumbled\r\nseaward over the undesecrated sands; when a broad arm of the sea still\r\ncut off Westgate from the Reculver cliffs, and when the tide swept\r\nunopposed four times a day over the submerged sands of Minster Level.\r\nYou must think of Thanet as then greatly resembling Wight in\r\ngeographical features, and the Wantsum as the equivalent of the Solent\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nIn the very earliest period of our history, before ever the existing\r\nnames had been given at all to the towns or villages--nay, when the\r\ntowns and villages themselves were not--Ruim was already a noteworthy\r\nisland. For there is now very little doubt indeed that Thanet is the\r\nIctis or 'Channel Island' to which Cornish tin was conveyed across\r\nBritain for shipment to the continent. The great harbour of Britain was\r\nthen the Wantsum Sea, known afterwards as the Rutupine Port, and later\r\nstill as Sandwich Haven. To that port came Gaulish and Phoenician\r\nvessels, or possibly even at times some belated Phocæan galley from\r\nMassilia. But the trade in tin was one of immense antiquity, long\r\nantedating these almost modern commercial nations: for tin is a\r\nnecessary component of bronze, and the bronze age of Europe was\r\nentirely dependent for its supply of that all-important metal upon the\r\nCornish mines. From a very early date, therefore, we may be sure that\r\ningots of tin were exported by this route to the continent, and then\r\ntransported overland by the Rhone valley to the shores of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe tin road, to give it its more proper name, followed the crest of\r\nthe Hog's Back and the Guildford downs, crossing the various rivers at\r\nspots whose very names still attest the ancient passages--the Wey at\r\nShalford, the Mole at Burford, the Medway at Aylesford, and the Wantsum\r\nStrait at Wade, in which last I seem to hear the dim echo to this day\r\nof the Roman Vada. Ruim itself, as less liable to attack than an inland\r\nplace, formed the depôt for the tin trade, and the ingots were no doubt\r\nshipped near the site of Richborough. We may regard it, in fact, as a\r\nsort of prehistoric Hong-Kong or Zanzibar, a trading island, where\r\nmerchants might traffic at ease with the shy and suspicious islanders.\r\n\r\nRuim at that time must have consisted almost entirely of open down,\r\nsloping upward from the tidal Wantsum, and extending a little farther\r\nout to sea than at the present moment. Pegwell Bay was then a wide\r\nsea-mouth; Sandwich flats did not yet exist; and the Stour itself fell\r\ninto the Wantsum Strait at the place which still bears the historic\r\nname of Stourmouth. Round the outer coast only a few houseless gaps\r\nmarked the spots where 'long lines of cliff, breaking, had left a\r\nchasm'--the gaps that afterwards bore the familiar names of Ramsgate,\r\nthat is to say Ruim's Gate, or 'the Door of Thanet;' Margate, that is\r\nto say, Mere Gate, the gap of the mere (Kentish for a brook),\r\nBroadstairs, Kingsgate, Newgate, and Westgate. The present condition of\r\nDumpton Gap (minus the telegraph) will give some idea of what these\r\nGates looked like in their earliest days; only, instead of seeing the\r\ncultivated down, we must imagine it wildly clad with primæval\r\nundergrowth of yew and juniper, like the beautiful tangled district\r\nnear Guildford, still known as Fairyland. Thanet is now all\r\nsea-front--it turns its face, freckled with summer resorts, towards the\r\nopen German Ocean. Ruim had then no sea-front at all, save the bare and\r\ninaccessible white cliffs; it turned, such as it was, not toward the\r\nsea, but toward the navigable Wantsum. Even until late in the middle\r\nages Minster was the most important place in the whole island; and\r\nafter it ranked Monkton, St. Nicholas, and Birchington--villages, all\r\nof them, on the flat western slope. The growth in importance of the\r\nseaward escarpment dates only from the days when Thanet became\r\npractically a London suburb.\r\n\r\nWith the Roman invasion Ruim saw a new epoch begin. A great\r\norganization took hold of Britain. Roads were made and colonies\r\nestablished. Verulam and Camulodun gave place in part as centres of\r\nlife and trade to York and London. Even in the native days, I believe,\r\nthe Thames must always have been a great commercial focus, and the Pool\r\nby Tower Hill must always have been what Bede called it many centuries\r\nlater, 'a mart of many nations.' But under the Romans London grew into\r\na considerable city; and as the regular sea highway to the Thames lay\r\nthrough the Wantsum, in the rear of Thanet, that strip of estuary\r\nbecame of immense importance. In those days of coasting navigation,\r\nindeed, the habit was to avoid headlands, and take advantage everywhere\r\nof shallow short cuts. Ships from the continent, therefore, avoided the\r\nNorth Foreland by running through the Wantsum at the back of Thanet; as\r\nthey avoided Shellness and Warden Point by running through the Swale,\r\nat the back of Sheppey.\r\n\r\nTo protect this main navigable channel, accordingly, the Romans built\r\nthe two great guardian fortresses of the coast, Rutupiæ, or\r\nRichborough, at the southern entrance, and Regulbium, or Reculver, at\r\nthe northern exit. Under the walls of these powerful strongholds, whose\r\ngrim ruins still frown upon the dry channel at their feet, ships were\r\nsafe from piracy, while Ruim itself sheltered them from the heavy sea\r\nthat now beats with north-east winds upon the Foreland beyond. In fact,\r\nthe Wantsum was an early Spithead: it stood to Rutupiæ as the Solent\r\nstands to Portsmouth and Southampton. But Thanet Isle hardly shared at\r\nall in this increased civilisation; on the contrary, Rutupiæ (the\r\nprecursor of Sandwich Haven) seems to have diverted all its early\r\ncommerce. For Rutupiæ became clearly the naval capital of our island,\r\nthe seat of that _vir spectabilis_, the Count of Saxon Shore, and the\r\nrendezvous of the fleets of those British 'usurpers' Maximus and\r\nCarausius. It was also the Dover of its own day, the favourite landing\r\nplace for continental travellers; while its famous oysters, the true\r\nnatives, now driven by the silting up of their ancient beds to\r\nWhitstable, were as much in repute with Roman epicures as their\r\ndescendants are to-day with the young Luculluses of the Gaiety and the\r\nCriterion.\r\n\r\nI have ventured by this time to speak of Ruim as Thanet; and indeed\r\nthat was already one of the names by which the island was known to its\r\nown inhabitants. The ordinary history books, to be sure, will tell you\r\nin their glib way that Thanet is 'Saxon' for Ruim; but, when they say\r\nso, believe not the fond thing, vainly imagined. The name is every day\r\nas old as the Roman occupation. Solinus, writing in the third century,\r\ncalls it Thanaton, and in the torn British fragment of the Peutinger\r\nTables--that curious old map of the later empire--it is marked as\r\nTenet. Indeed, it is a matter of demonstration that every spot which\r\nhad a known name in Roman Britain retained that name after the English\r\nconquest. Kent itself is a case in point, and every one of its towns\r\nbears out the law, from Dover and Lymne to Reculver and Richborough,\r\nwhich last is spelt 'Ratesburg' by Leland, Henry the Eighth's\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, however, Thanet, under the Romans, must have shared in\r\nthe general advance of the country. Solinus says it was 'glad with\r\ncorn-fields'--_felix frumentariis campis_--but this could only have\r\nbeen on the tertiary slope facing Kent, as agriculture had not yet\r\nattempted to scale the flanks of the chalk downs. As lying so near\r\nRutupiæ, too, villas must certainly have occupied the soil in places,\r\nas we know they did in the Isle of Wight; while the immense number of\r\nRoman coins picked up in the island appears to betoken a somewhat dense\r\nprovincial population.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the English brings Thanet itself, as distinct from its\r\nancient port, the Wantsum, into the full glare of legendary history.\r\nAccording to tradition, it was at Ebb's Fleet, a little side creek near\r\nMinster, that Hengest and Horsa first disembarked in Britain. As a\r\nmatter of fact, there is reason to suppose that at a very early time an\r\nEnglish colony did really settle down in peace in Thanet. On Osengal\r\nHill, not far from Ebb's Fleet, the cemetery of these earliest English\r\npioneers in England was laid bare by the building of the South Eastern\r\nRailway. The graves are dug very shallow in the chalk, seldom as deep\r\nas four feet; and in them lie the remains of the old heathen pirates,\r\nburied with their arms and personal ornaments, their amber beads and\r\nstrings of glass, and the coins that were to pay their way in the other\r\nworld. But, what is oddest of all, a few of the graves in this earliest\r\nEnglish cemetery are Roman in character, and in them the interment is\r\nmade in the Roman fashion. The inference is almost irresistible that\r\nthe first settlement of Thanet by the English was a purely friendly\r\none, and that Roman and Jute lived on side by side as neighbours and\r\nallies on the Kentish island.\r\n\r\nI don't doubt, myself, that the whole settlement of Kent was equally\r\nfriendly, and that the population of the county contains throughout an\r\nalmost balanced mixture of Celtic and Teutonic elements.\r\n\r\nHowever, the century and a half that succeeded the English colonization\r\nof south-eastern Britain were, no doubt, a time of great retrogression\r\ntowards barbarism, as everywhere else in Romanised Europe. The villas\r\nthat must have covered the gentle slopes towards the Wantsum fell into\r\ndecay; the fortresses were destroyed; the roads ran wild; and the sea\r\nand river began slowly to slit up the central part of the great\r\nnavigable backwater. A hundred and fifty years after Hengest and Horsa,\r\nif those excellent gentlemen ever really existed, another famous\r\nlanding took place in Thanet. Augustine and his companions disembarked\r\nat Ebb's Fleet, and held close by (on the hill behind Prospect House)\r\ntheir first interview with Æthelberht. But though this epoch-making\r\nevent happened to occur in Thanet, it has no special connection with\r\nthe history of the island, any further than as a component of England\r\ngenerally. And indeed, even through the garbled version of Bede, it is\r\nplain enough to see that British Christendom was not yet wholly wiped\r\nout in eastern Britain. The conversion of Kent was essentially a\r\nconversion of the king and nobles to the Roman communion; it brought\r\nback once more the part of Britain most in connection with the\r\ncontinent into the broad fold of continental Christendom. It is quite\r\nclear, in fact, that Rutupiæ and Durovernum, Richborough and\r\nCanterbury, had never ceased to hold close intercourse with the\r\nopposite shore, whose cliffs still shine so distinctly from the hills\r\nabout Ramsgate. For Æthelberht himself was married to a Christian\r\nFrankish princess of the house of the Merwings; and coins of the\r\nFrankish kings and of the Byzantine emperors have been found on the\r\nsurface or in contemporary Jutish graves in Kent.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe, too, that of the monks whom Gregory chose\r\nto accompany Augustine on his easy mission, one was Lawrence, who\r\nsucceeded his leader as second Archbishop of Canterbury, and another\r\nwas Peter, the first Abbot of St. Augustine's monastery. Out of\r\ncompliment to these pioneer missionaries, or to their Roman house of\r\nSt. Andrew's, almost every old church in that part of Kent is dedicated\r\naccordingly, either to St. Augustine, St. Lawrence, St. Peter, St.\r\nGregory, St. Andrew, or St. Martin (patron of Bertha's first church at\r\nCanterbury). Thus, as we shall see hereafter, St. Lawrence was the\r\nmother church of Ramsgate, and St. Peter's of Broadstairs, while the\r\nentire lathe bears the name of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\nIn Thanet, too, the first evidence of the new order of things was the\r\nfoundation in the island of that great civilizing agency of mediæval\r\nEngland, a monastery. The site chosen for its home was still, however,\r\ncharacteristic of the old point of view of Thanet. It was the place\r\nthat yet bears the name of Minster, situated on a little creek of the\r\nWantsum sea, where some slight remains of an ancient pier may even now\r\nbe traced among the silt of the marshes. The island still looked\r\ntowards the narrow seas and the port of Rutupiæ, not, as now, towards\r\nthe tall cliffs and the German Ocean. Ecgberht, fourth Christian king\r\nof Kent, by the advice of Theodore, the monk of Tarsus who became\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, made over to the lady whose name is\r\nconveniently Latinised as Dompneva, first abbess, some forty-eight\r\nplough-lands in the Isle of Thanet. This cultivated district, bounded\r\nby the ancient earthwork known (from the name of the second abbess) as\r\nSt. Mildred's Lynch, lay almost entirely within the westward-sloping\r\nand mainly tertiary lands; the higher chalk country was as yet\r\napparently considered unfit for tillage. The existing remains of\r\nMinster Abbey are, of course, of comparatively late Plantagenet date;\r\nbut as parts of a great grange, whose still larger granary was burnt\r\ndown only in the last century, they serve well to show the importance\r\nof the monastic system as a civilizing agency in the country districts\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nAlready in Bede's time the Wantsum was beginning to get silted up,\r\nmainly by the muddy deposits brought down by the Stour. It was then\r\nonly three furlongs wide, and could be forded at two points, near Sarr\r\nand at Wade. The seaward mouth was also beginning to be encumbered with\r\nsand, and the first indication we get of this important impending\r\nchange is the fact that we now hear less of Richborough, and more of\r\nSandwich, the new port a little nearer the sea, whose very name of the\r\nWick or haven on the Sand, in itself sufficiently tells the history of\r\nits origin. As the older port got progressively silted up, the newer\r\none grew into ever greater importance, exactly as Norwich ousted\r\nCaister, or as Portsmouth has taken the place of Porchester.\r\nNevertheless, the central channel still remained navigable for the\r\nvessels of that age--they can only have drawn a very few feet of\r\nwater--and this made the Wantsum in time the great highway for the\r\nDanish pirates on their way to London, and exposed Thanet exceptionally\r\nto their relentless incursions.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Danes and Northmen were just what they loved to call\r\nthemselves, vik-ings or wickings, men of the viks, wicks, bays, or\r\nestuaries. What they loved was a fiord, a strait, a peninsula, an\r\nisland. Everywhere round the coast of Britain they seized and fortified\r\nthe projecting headlands. But in the neighbourhood of the Thames, the\r\nhigh road to the great commercial port of London, the mementoes of\r\ntheir presence are particularly frequent. The whole nomenclature of the\r\nlower Thames navigation, as Canon Isaac Taylor has pointed out, is\r\nScandinavian to this day. Deptford (the deep fiord), Greenwich (the\r\ngreen reach), and Woolwich (the hill reach) all bear good Norse names.\r\nSo do the Foreness, the Whiteness, Shellness, Sheerness, Shoeburyness,\r\nFoulness, Wrabness, and Orfordness. Walton-on-the-Naze near Harwich in\r\nlike manner still recalls the time when a Danish 'wall'--that is to\r\nsay, a _vallum_, or earthwork--ran across the isthmus to defend the\r\nScandinavian peninsula from its English enemies.\r\n\r\nAt such a time Sandwich, with its shallow fiord, was sure to afford\r\ngood shelter to the northern long ships; and isolated Thanet,\r\noverlooking the navigable strait, was a predestined depôt for the\r\nnorthern pirates, as four centuries earlier it had been for the\r\nfollowers of those mythical personifications, Hengest and Horsa. Long\r\nbefore the unification of England under a single West Saxon\r\noverlordship the Danes used to land in the island every year, to\r\nplunder the crops, and in 851, when Æthelwulf was lord of Wessex at\r\nWinchester, 'heathen men,' says the Winchester Chronicle, with its\r\nusual charming conciseness, 'first sat over winter in Tenet.' From that\r\ntime forward the 'heathen men' continually returned to the island,\r\nwhich they used apparently as a base of operations, with their ships\r\nlying in Sandwich Haven; in fact, Thanet must long have been a sort of\r\nirregular Danish colony. Still, St. Mildred's nuns appear to have lived\r\non somehow at Minster through the dark time, for in 988 the Danes\r\nlanded and burnt the abbey, as they did again under Swegen in 1011,\r\nkilling at the same time the abbess and all the inmates. On the whole,\r\nit is probable that life and property in Thanet were far from secure\r\nany time in the ninth, tenth, and early eleventh centuries.\r\n\r\nAt least as late as the Norman conquest the Wantsum remained a\r\nnavigable channel, and the usual route to London by sea was in at\r\nSandwich and out at Northmouth. It was thus that King Harold's fleet\r\nsailed on its plundering expedition round the coast of Kent (a small\r\nunexplained incident of the early English type, only to be understood\r\nby the analogies of later Scotch history), and thus too, that many\r\nother expeditions are described in the concise style of our\r\nunsophisticated early historians. But from the eleventh century onward\r\nwe hear little of the Wantsum as a navigable channel; it has dwindled\r\ndown almost entirely to Sandwich Haven, 'the most famous of English\r\nports,' says the writer of the life of Emma of Normandy, about 1050.\r\nSandwich is indeed the oldest of the Cinque Ports, succeeding in this\r\nmatter to the honours of Rutupiæ, and all through the middle ages it\r\nremained the great harbour for continental traffic. Edward III. sailed\r\nthence for France or Flanders, and as late as 1446 it is still spoken\r\nof by a foreign ambassador as the resort of ships from all quarters of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nStill, the Wantsum was all this while gradually silting up, a grain at\r\na time, and the Isle of Ruim was slowly becoming joined to the opposite\r\nmainland. When Leland visited it, in Henry VIII.'s reign, the change\r\nwas almost complete. 'At Northmouth,' says the royal commissioner, in\r\nhis quaint dry way, 'where the estery of the se was, the salt water\r\nswelleth yet up at a Creeke a myle or more toward a place called Sarre,\r\nwhich was the commune fery when Thanet was fulle iled.' Sandwich Haven\r\nitself began to be difficult of access about 1500 (Henry VII. being\r\nking), and in 1558 (under Mary) a Flemish engineer, 'a cunning and\r\nexpert man in waterworks,' was engaged to remedy the blocking of the\r\nchannel. By a century later it was quite closed, and the Isle of Thanet\r\nhad ceased to exist, except in name, the Stour now flowing seaward by a\r\nlong bend through Minster Level, while hardly a relic of the Wantsum\r\ncould be traced in the artificial ditches that intersect the flat and\r\nbanked-up surface of the St. Nicholas marshes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Thanet had been growing once more into an agricultural\r\ncountry. Minster, untenable by its nuns, had been made over after the\r\nDanish invasions to the monks of St. Augustine at Canterbury, and it\r\nwas they who built the great barn and manor house which were the outer\r\nsymbol of its new agricultural importance. Monkton, close by, belonged\r\nto the rival house of Christ Church at Canterbury (the cathedral\r\nmonastery), as did also St. Nicholas at Wade, remarkable for its large\r\nand handsome Early English church. All these ecclesiastical lands were\r\nexcellently tilled. After the Reformation, however, things changed\r\ngreatly. The silting up of the Wantsum and the decay of Sandwich Haven\r\nleft Thanet quite out of the world, remote from all the main highroads\r\nof the new England. Ships now went past the North Foreland to London,\r\nand knew it only as a dangerous point, not without a sinister\r\nreputation for wrecking. On the other hand, on the land side, the\r\nisland lay off the great highways, surrounded by marsh or\r\nhalf-reclaimed levels; and it seems rapidly to have sunk into a state\r\nresembling that of the more distant parts of Cornwall. The inhabitants\r\ndegenerated into good wreckers and bad tillers. They say an Orkney man\r\nis a farmer who owns a boat, while a Shetlander is a fisherman who owns\r\na farm. In much the same spirit, Camden speaks of the Elizabethan\r\nThanet folks as 'a sort of amphibious creatures, equally skilled in\r\nholding helm and plough'; while Lewis, early in the last century, tells\r\nus they made 'two voyages a year to the North Seas, and came home soon\r\nenough for the men to go to the wheat season.' With genial tolerance\r\nthe Georgian historian adds, 'It's a thousand pities they are so apt to\r\npilfer stranded ships.' Piracy, which ran in the Thanet blood, seemed\r\nto their good easy local annalist a regrettable peccadillo.\r\n\r\nIn all this, however, we begin to catch the first faintly-resounding\r\nnote of modern Thanet. The intelligent reader will no doubt have\r\nobserved, with his usual acuteness, that up to date we have heard\r\npractically nothing of Ramsgate, Margate, and Broadstairs, which now\r\nform the real centres of population in the nominal island. Its\r\nrelations have all been with Rutupiæ, Sandwich, Canterbury, and the\r\nmainland. But the silting up of the Wantsum turned the new Thanet\r\nseaward, by the chalky cliffs; and the gaps or gates in that natural\r\nsea-wall now began to be of comparative importance as fishing stations\r\nand small havens. Ebb's Fleet was no longer the port of Ruim. The\r\ncentre of gravity of the island shifts at this point, accordingly, from\r\nMinster to Ramsgate. The change is well marked by certain interesting\r\necclesiastical facts. Neither Ramsgate nor Broadstairs had originally\r\nchurches of their own. The first formed part of the parish of St.\r\nLawrence, which was itself a mere chapelry of Minster till late in the\r\nthirteenth century. The old village lies half a mile inland, and\r\nRamsgate itself was throughout the middle ages nothing more than a mere\r\ngap and cove where the fishermen of St. Lawrence kept their boats. The\r\nfirst church in the town proper was not erected till 1791. Similarly,\r\nBroadstairs formed part of the parish of St. Peter's, the village of\r\nwhich lies back at about the same distance from the sea as St.\r\nLawrence; and St Peter's, too, was at first a chapelry of Minster. The\r\ncliffs were then nothing; the inward slope was everything.\r\n\r\nMargate seems to have been the first place in the new Thanet to attain\r\nthe honour of a place in history. As in two previous cases, the Mere\r\nGate was at first but a fisherman's station for the village of St.\r\nJohn's, which gathered about the old church at the south end of the\r\nexisting town. But as the Northmouth closed up, and Sandwich Haven\r\ndecayed, the Mere Gate naturally became the little local port for corn\r\ngrown on the island and wool raised on the newly-reclaimed Minster\r\nLevel. A wooden pier existed at Margate long before the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., when Leland found it \"sore decayed,\" and the village was in\r\nrepute for fishery and coasting trade. Throughout the Stuart period\r\nMargate was the ordinary place of departure and arrival for Flushing\r\nand the Low Countries. William of Orange frequently sailed hence, and\r\nMaryborough used it for almost all his expeditions. It was about the\r\nmiddle of the last century, however, that the real prosperity of\r\nMargate first began. Then it was that citizens of credit and renown in\r\nLondon first hit upon the glorious discovery of the seaside, and that\r\nwatering-places tentatively and timidly raised their unobtrusive heads\r\nalong the nearer beaches. The journey from London could be made far\r\nmore easily by river than that to Brighton by coach; and so Margate,\r\nthe nearest spot to town (by water) on the real sea with any\r\naccommodation for visitors, became in point of fact the earliest London\r\nseaside resort. It was, if not the first place, at least one of the\r\nfirst places in England to offer to its guests the perilous joy of\r\nbathing machines, which were inaugurated here about 1790.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of steamers Margate's fortune was made. Floods of\r\nCockneydom were let loose upon the nascent lodging-houses. Then came\r\nthe London, Chatham and Dover, and South Eastern Railways, and with\r\nthem an ever-increasing inundation of good-humoured cheap-trippers. The\r\nHall-by-the-Sea and other modern improvements and attractions followed.\r\nLike the rest of Thanet, Margate has now become a mere suburb of\r\nLondon, and what it resembles at the present day a delicate regard for\r\nthe feelings of the inhabitants forbids me to enlarge upon. I will\r\nmerely add that the recognized modern name of Margate is an\r\netymological blunder, due to the idea immortalized in the borough\r\nmotto, \"Porta maris, Portus salutis,\" that it means Door of the Sea.\r\nThe true word is still universally preserved on the lips of the local\r\nfisher-folk, who always religiously call it either Meregate or Mergate.\r\n\r\nRamsgate, a much more attractive and enjoyable centre, rich in\r\nexcursions to points of genuine interest, dates somewhat later. It\r\nfirst came into note about the beginning of the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen it did a modest trade with the Levant and the Black Sea, or, as\r\ncontemporary English more prettily phrases it, 'with Russia and the\r\neast country.' In 1750 the first pier was built, as a national work,\r\nmainly to serve as a harbour of refuge for ships caught in gales off\r\nthe Downs. The engineer was Smeaton, and he succeeded in creating an\r\nartificial harbour of great extent, which has lasted substantially up\r\nto the present time. This new port, rendered safer by the enlargement\r\nin 1788, made Ramsgate at once into an important seafaring town, the\r\ncapital of the Kentish herring trade, alive with smacks in the busy\r\nseason. The steamers did it less good at first than they did to\r\nMargate; but the completion of the two railways, and the building of\r\nthe handsome extensions on the east and west cliffs, turned it at once\r\ninto a frequented watering-place. It is the fashion nowadays rather to\r\nlaugh at Ramsgate. Marine painters know better. Few harbours are\r\nlivelier with red and brown sails; few coasts more enjoyable than the\r\ncliff walk looking across towards the Goodwins, the low shore by\r\nSandwich, the higher ground about Deal and Dover, and the dim white\r\nline of Cape Blancnez in the distance.\r\n\r\nBroadstairs, close by the lighthouse on the North Foreland (the Cantium\r\nPromontorium of Roman geography), is still newer as a place of public\r\nresort. But as a fishing village it dates back to the middle ages, when\r\nthe little chapel of \"Our Lady of Bradstow\" stood in the gap of the\r\ncliffs, and was much addressed by anxious sailors rounding the\r\ndangerous point after the silting up of the Wantsum. Ships as they\r\npassed lowered their top-sails to do it reverence. Under Henry VIII. a\r\nsmall wooden pier was thrown out to protect the fishing boats; and\r\nabout the same time, as part of the general scheme of coast defence\r\ninaugurated by the king, a gate and portcullis were erected to close\r\nthe gap seaward, in case of invasion. The archway and portcullis groove\r\nremain to this day, with an inscription recording their repair in 1795\r\nby Sir John Henniker. The railway has turned Broadstairs into a minor\r\nrival of Ramsgate and Margate and 'a favourite resort for gentry,'\r\nwhere 'those who require quietness, either from ill health or a\r\nretiring disposition,' says a local guide-book, may enjoy 'the united\r\nadvantages of tranquillity and seclusion.' Hundreds of retiring souls\r\nindeed may be observed on the beach any day during the season, seeking\r\ntranquillity in a game of cards, repairing their health with the\r\nstimulus of donkey exercise, or soothing their souls in secret hour\r\nwith music sweet as love, discoursed to them by gentlemen in loose pink\r\nsuits and artificially imitated Æthiopian countenances.\r\n\r\nWestgate is the very latest-born of these Thanet gates, a brand-new\r\nwatering-place, where every house proclaims the futility of the popular\r\nbelief that Queen Anne is dead, and where fashionable physicians send\r\nfashionable patients to cure imaginary diseases by a dose of fresh air.\r\nIt has no history, for only a few years since it consisted entirely of\r\na coastguard station and three or four cottages: but it is interesting\r\nas casting light on the nature of the revolution which has turned\r\nThanet inside out and hind part before, making the open sea take the\r\nplace of the Kentish mainland, and the railway to London that of the\r\nsilted Wantsum.\r\n\r\nAt the present day Thanet as a whole consists of two parts: the live\r\nsea front, which is one long succession of suburban watering-places;\r\nand the agricultural interior, including the reclaimed estuary, which\r\nranks among the best-farmed and most productive districts in all\r\nEngland, Yet till a very recent date the Thanet farmers still retained\r\nthe use of the old Kentish plough, the coulter of which is reversed at\r\nthe end of every furrow; and many other curious insular customs mark\r\noff the agriculture of the island even now from that which prevails\r\nover the rest of the country.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether I'm wrong, but it often seems to me the very best\r\nway to gain an idea of the real history of England is thus to take a\r\nsingle district piecemeal, and trace out for one's self the main\r\nfeatures of its gradual evolution. By so doing we get away from mere\r\ndynastic or political considerations, leave behind the bang of drums or\r\nthe blare of trumpets, and reach down to the living facts of common\r\nhuman activity themselves--the realities of the workaday world of\r\ntoilers and spinners. By narrowing our field of view, in fact, we gain\r\na clearer picture on our smaller focus. We see how the big historical\r\nrevolutions actually affected the life of the people; and we trace more\r\nreadily the true nature of deep-reaching changes when we follow them\r\nout in detail over a particular area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     A HILL-TOP STRONGHOLD.\r\n\r\n'Why, what did they want to build a city right up here for, anyway?'\r\nthe pretty American asked, who had come with us to Fiesole, as we\r\nrested, panting, after our long steep climb, on the cathedral platform.\r\n\r\nNow the question was a pertinent and in its way a truly philosophical\r\none. Fiesole crests the ridge of a Tuscan hill, and in America they\r\ndon't build cities on hill-tops. You may search through the length and\r\nbreadth of the United States, from Maine to California, and I venture\r\nto bet a modest dollar you won't find a single town perched anywhere in\r\na position at all resembling that of many a glowing Etrurian fastness,\r\nthat 'Like an eagle's nest Hangs on the crest Of purple Apennine.'\r\nTowns in America stand all on the level: most of them are built by\r\nharbours of sea or inland lake; or by navigable rivers; or at the\r\njunction of railways; or at a point where cataracts (sadly debased)\r\nsupply ample water-power for saw-mills and factories; or else in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of coal, iron, oil wells, or gold and silver\r\nmines. In short, the position of American towns bears always an\r\nimmediate and obvious reference to the wants and necessities of our\r\nmodern industrial and commercial system. They are towns that have grown\r\nup in a state of profound peace, and that imply advanced means of\r\ncommunication, with a free interchange of agricultural and manufactured\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nHence in America it is always quite easy to see at a glance the _raison\r\nd'être_ of every town or village one comes across. New York, Boston,\r\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore--New Orleans, Montreal, San Francisco,\r\nCharleston--are all great ports for the exportation of corn, pork,\r\n'lumber,' cotton, or tobacco, and the importation of European\r\nmanufactured goods. Chicago is the main collecting and distributing\r\ncentre for the wide basin of the upper Great Lakes, as Cincinnati is\r\nfor the Ohio Valley, and St. Louis for the Mississippi and Missouri\r\nconfluents. Pittsburg bases itself upon its coal and its iron; Buffalo\r\nexists as the point of transfer where elevators raise the corn of\r\nChicago from lake-going vessels into the long, low barges of the Erie\r\nCanal. In every case, in that newest of worlds, one can see for oneself\r\nat a glance exactly why so large a body of human beings has collected\r\njust at that precise spot, and at no other.\r\n\r\nBut when you have toiled up, hot and breathless, through olive and\r\npine, from the Viale at Florence to the antique Cyclopean walls of\r\nEtruscan Fæsulæ, you wonder to yourself, like our American friend, as\r\nyou pant on the terrace of the Romanesque cathedral, what on earth they\r\ncould ever have wanted to build a town up there for, anyway.\r\n\r\nIf we look away from Tuscany to our own England, however, we shall find\r\non many a deserted down or lonely tor ample evidence of the causes\r\nwhich led the people of this ancient Etruscan town to build their\r\ncitadel at so great a height above the neighbouring valley. Fiesole,\r\nsays Dante, in a well-known verse, was the mother of Florence. Even so\r\nin England, Old Sarum was indeed the mother of Salisbury, and Caer\r\nBadon or Sulis was the mother of Bath. And when there was first a\r\nFæsulæ on the hill here there could be no Florence, as when first there\r\nwas an Old Sarum on the Wiltshire downs there could be no Salisbury,\r\nand when first there was a Caer Badon on the heights of Avon there\r\ncould be no Bath.\r\n\r\nIn very early times indeed, in the European land area, when men began\r\nfirst to gather together into towns or villages, two necessities\r\ndetermined their choice of a place to dwell in: first, food-supply\r\n(including water); and second, defence. Hence every early community\r\nstands, to start with, near its own cultivable territory, usually a\r\nbroad river-valley, an alluvial plain, a 'carse' or lowland, for\r\nuplands as yet were incapable of tillage by the primitive agriculture\r\nof those early epochs. But it does not stand actually _in_ the carse;\r\nit occupies as a rule the nearest convenient height or hill-top, most\r\noften the one that juts out farthest into the subjacent plain, by way\r\nof security against the attack of enemies. This is the beginning of\r\nalmost every great historical European town; it is an arx or acropolis\r\noverhanging its own tilth or _ager_; and though in many cases the town\r\ncame down at last into the valley, retaining still its old name, yet\r\nthe remains of the old earthworks or walls on the hill-top above often\r\nbear witness to our own day to the original site of the antique\r\nsettlement upon the high places.\r\n\r\nOne can mark, too, various stages in this gradual process of secular\r\ndescent from the wind-swept hills into the valleys below, as freer\r\ncommunications and greater security made access to water, roads, and\r\nrivers of greater importance than mere defence or elevated position. At\r\nBath, for example, it was the Pax Romana that brought down the town\r\nfrom the stockaded height of Caer Badon, and the Hill of Solisbury to\r\nthe ford and the hot springs in the valley of the Avon. At Old Sarum,\r\non the other hand, the hill-top town remained much longer: it lived\r\nfrom the Celtic first into the Roman and then into the West Saxon\r\nworld; it had a cathedral of its own in Norman times; and even long\r\nafter Bishop Roger Poore founded the New Sarum, which we now call\r\nSalisbury, at the point where the great west road passed the river\r\nbelow, the hill-top town continued to be inhabited, and, as everybody\r\nknows, when all its population had finally dwindled away, retained some\r\nvestige of its ancient importance by returning a member of its own for\r\na single farmhouse to the unreformed Parliament till '32. As for\r\nFiesole, though Florence has long since superseded it as the capital of\r\nthe Arno Valley, the town itself still lives on to our own time in a\r\ndead-alive way, and, like Norman. Old Sarum, retains even now its\r\nbeautiful old cathedral, its Palazzo Pretorio, and its acknowledged\r\nclaims to ancient boroughship. In England, I know by personal\r\nexperience only one such hill-top town of the antique sort still\r\nsurviving, and that is Shaftsbury; but I am told that Launceston, with\r\nits strong castle overlooking the Tamar, is even a finer example. This\r\nrelatively early disappearance of the hill-top fortress from our own\r\nmidst is in part due, no doubt, to the early growth of the industrial\r\nspirit in England, and our long-continued freedom from domestic\r\nwarfare. But all over Southern Europe, as everybody must have noticed,\r\nthe hill-top town, perched, like Eza, on the very summit of a pointed\r\npinnacle, still remains everywhere in evidence as a common object of\r\nthe country in our own day.\r\n\r\nI said above that Fiesole was the mother of Florence, and, in spite of\r\nformal objections to the contrary, I venture to defend that now\r\nsomewhat obsolete and heretical opinion. For why does Fiesole stand\r\njust where it does? What made them build a city up there, anyway? Well,\r\na town always exists just where it does exist for some good and amply\r\nsufficient reason. Even if, like Fiesole, it is mainly a survival\r\n(though at Fiesole there are, indeed, olives in plenty and other live\r\ntrades to keep a town going), it yet exists there in virtue of facts\r\nwhich once upon a time were quite sufficient to bring the world to the\r\nspot, and it goes on existing, partly by mere conservative use and\r\nwont, no doubt, but partly also because there are houses, churches,\r\nmills, and roads all ready built there. Now, a town must always, from a\r\nvery early period, have existed upon the exact site of Fiesole. And\r\nwhy? To answer that question you have only to look at the view from the\r\nplatform. I do not mean to suggest that the ancient Etruscans came\r\nthere to enjoy the prospect as we go nowadays to the hotels on the Rigi\r\nor to the summit of Mount Washington. The ancient Etruscan was a\r\npractical man, and his views about views were probably rudimentary. But\r\ngaze down for a moment from the cathedral platform upon the valley of\r\nthe Arno, spread like a glowing picture at your feet, and see how\r\nimmediately it resolves the doubt. Not, indeed, the valley of the Arno\r\nas it stands at present, thick set with tower and spire and palace. In\r\norder to arrive at the _raison d'être_ of Fiesole you must blot out\r\nmentally Arnolfo's vast pile, and Brunelleschi's dome, and Giotto's\r\ncampanile, and Savonarola's monastery, and the tall and slender tower\r\nof the Palazzo Vecchio, rising like a shaft sheer into the air far, far\r\nbelow--you must blot out, in short, all that makes the world now\r\ncongregate at Florence, and all Florence itself into the bargain.\r\nNowhere on earth do I know a more peopled plain than that plain of Arno\r\nin our own time, seen on a sunny autumn day, when the light glints\r\nclearly on each white villa and church and hamlet, from this specular\r\nmount of antique Fiesole. But to understand why Fiesole itself stands\r\nthere at all you must neglect all this, neglect all the wealth of art\r\nthat makes each inch of that valley classic ground, and look only, if\r\nyou can for a brief moment, at the bare facts of primitive nature.\r\n\r\nAnd what then do you see? Spread far below you, and basking in the\r\nsunshine, a comparatively flat and wide, open valley; olive and stone\r\npine and mulberry on its slopes; pasture land and flowery vale in its\r\nmidst. North and south, in two long ridges, the Apennines stretch their\r\nhard, blue outlines from Carrara to Siena against the afternoon\r\nsky--outlines of a sort that one never gets in northern lands, but\r\nwhich remind one so exactly of the painted background to a\r\nfifteenth-century Italian picture that nature seems here, to our\r\ntopsy-turvy fancy, to be whimsically imitating an effect from art. But\r\nin between those two tossed and tumbled guardian ridges, the valley of\r\nthe Arno, as it flows towards Pisa, with the minor basins of its\r\ntributary streams, expands for a while about Florence itself into a\r\nbroad and comparatively level plain. In a mountain country so broken\r\nand heaved about as Peninsular Italy, every spare inch of cultivable\r\nplain like that has incalculable value. True, on the terraced slopes of\r\nthe hillsides generation after generation of ingenious men have managed\r\nto build up, tier by tier, a wonderful expanse of artificial tilth. But\r\nwhile oil and wine can be produced upon the terraces, it is on the\r\nriver valleys alone that the early inhabitants had to depend for their\r\ncorn, their cheese, and their flesh-meat. Hence, in primitive Italy and\r\nin primitive England alike, every such open alluvial plain, fit for\r\ntilth or grazing, had overhanging it a stockaded hill-fort, which grew\r\nwith time into a mediæval town or a walled city. It is just so that\r\nCaer Badon at Bath overhangs, with its prehistoric earthworks, the\r\nplain of Avon on which Beau Nash's city now spreads its streets, and it\r\nis just so that Old Sarum in turn overhangs, with its regular Roman\r\nfosses and gigantic glacis, the dale of the namesake river in Wilts,\r\nnear its point of confluence with the stream of the Wily.\r\n\r\nWe find it hard, no doubt, to imagine nowadays that once upon a time\r\nEngland was almost as thickly covered with hill-top villages (though on\r\nminor heights) as Italy is in the present century. Yet such was\r\nundoubtedly the case in prehistoric times. I know no better instance of\r\nthe way these stockaded villages were built than the magnificent group\r\nof antique earthworks in Dorset and Devon which rings round with a\r\ndouble row of fortresses the beautiful valley of the Axminster Axe.\r\nThere, on one side, a long line of strongholds built by the Durotriges\r\ncaps every jutting down and hill-top on the southern and eastern bank\r\nof the river, while facing them, on the opposite northern and western\r\nside, rises a similar series of Damnonian fortresses, crowning the\r\ncorresponding Devonshire heights. Lambert's Castle, Musberry Castle,\r\nHawksdown Castle, and so forth, the local nomenclature still calls\r\nthem, but they are castles, or _castra_, only in the now obsolete Roman\r\nsense; prehistoric earthworks, with dyke and trench, once stockaded\r\nwith wooden palings on top, and enclosing the huts and homes of the\r\ninhabitants. The river ran between the hostile territories; each\r\nvillage held its own strip of land below its fortress-height, and drove\r\nup its cattle, its women, and its children, in times of foray, to the\r\nsafety of the kraal or hill-top encampment.\r\n\r\nIn such a condition of society, of course, every community was\r\nabsolutely dependent upon its own territory for the means of\r\nsubsistence. And wherever the means of subsistence existed, a village\r\nwas sure to spring up in time upon the nearest hill-top. That is how\r\nthe oldest Fiesole of all first came to be perched there. It was a\r\nhill-top refuge for the tillers and grazers of the fertile Arno vale at\r\nits feet.\r\n\r\nBut why did the people of the Arno Valley fix upon the particular site\r\nof Fiesole? Surely on the southern side of the river, about the Viale\r\ndei Colli, the hills approach much nearer to the plain. From San\r\nMiniato and the Bello Sguardo one looks down far more directly upon the\r\ndomes and palaces and campaniles of Florence spread right at one's\r\nfeet. Why didn't the primitive inhabitants of the valley fix rather on\r\na spur of that nearer range--say the one where Galileo's tower\r\nstands--for the site of their village?\r\n\r\nIf you know Florence and have asked that question within yourself in\r\nall seriousness as you read, I see you haven't yet begun to throw\r\nyourself into the position of affairs in prehistoric Tuscany. You can't\r\nshuffle off your own century. For between the broad plain and the range\r\nof hills where the Viale dei Colli now winds serpentine on its\r\nbeautiful way round the glens and ravines, the Arno runs, a broad\r\ntorrent flood in times of freshet: the Arno, unbridged as yet (in the\r\ndays I speak of) by the Ponte Vecchio, an impassable frontier between\r\nthe wide territory of prehistoric Fiesole and the narrow fields of some\r\nminor village, long since forgotten, on the opposite bank. The great\r\nalluvial plain lies north of the river; the three streams whose silt\r\ncontributes to form it flow into the main channel from Pistoja and\r\nPrato. To live across the river on the south bank would have been\r\nabsolutely impossible for the owners of the plain. But Fiesole occupies\r\na central spur of the northern heights, overlooking the valley to east\r\nand west, and must therefore have been always the natural place from\r\nwhich to command the plain of Arno. A little above and a little below\r\nFlorence gorges once more hem the river in. So that the plain of\r\nFlorence (as we call it nowadays), the plain of Fiesole, as it once\r\nwas, formed at the beginning a little natural principality by itself,\r\nof which Fiesole was the obvious capital and stronghold.\r\n\r\nFor in order to understand Fiesole aright, we must always manage in our\r\nown minds to get rid entirely of that beautiful mushroom growth,\r\nFlorence, and to think only of the most ancient epoch. While we are in\r\nFlorence itself, to be sure, it seems to us always, by comparison with\r\nour modern English towns, that Florence is a place of immemorial\r\nantiquity. It was civilized when Britain was a den of thieves. While in\r\nfeudal England Edward I. was summoning his barons to repress the rising\r\nof William Wallace, in Florence, already a great commercial town,\r\nArnolfo di Cambio had received the sublime orders of the Signoria to\r\nconstruct for the Duomo 'the most sumptuous edifice that human\r\ninvention could desire or human labour execute,' and had carried out\r\nthose orders with consummate skill. While Edward III. was dreaming of\r\nhis lawless filibustering expeditions into France, Ciotto was\r\nencrusting the face of his glorious belfry with that magnificent\r\ndecoration of many-coloured marbles which makes northern churches look\r\nso cold and grey and barbaric by comparison. While Englishmen were\r\nburning Joan of Arc at Rouen, Fra Angelico was adorning the walls of\r\nSan Marco with those rapt saints and those spotless Madonnas. Even the\r\nvery back streets of Florence recall at every step its mediæval\r\nmagnificence. But when from Florence itself one turns to Fiesole, the\r\ncity by the Arno sinks at once by a sudden revulsion into a mere thing\r\nof yesterday by the side of the city on the Etruscan hill-top. Fiesole\r\nwas a town of immemorial antiquity while Florence was still, what\r\nperhaps its poetical name imports, a field of flowers.\r\n\r\nBut why this particular height rather than any other of the dozen that\r\njut out into the plain? Well, there we get at another fundamental point\r\nin hill-top town history. Fiesole had water. A spring at such a height\r\nis comparatively rare, but it is a necessary accompaniment, or rather a\r\ncondition precedent, of all high-place villages. In the Borgo Unto you\r\nwill still find this spring--a natural fountain, the Fonte Sotterra--in\r\nan underground passage, now approached (so greatly did the Fiesolans\r\nappreciate its importance) by a Gothic archway. The water supplies the\r\nwhole neighbourhood; and that accounts for the position of the town on\r\nthe low _col_ just below the acropolis.\r\n\r\nWho first chose the site it would be impossible to say; the earliest\r\nstockaded fort at Fiesole (enclosing the town and arx above) must go\r\nback to the very dawn of neolithic history, long before the Etruscans\r\nhad ever issued forth from their Rhætian fastnesses to occupy the blue\r\nand silver-grey hills of modern Tuscany. Nor do we know who built the\r\ngreat Cyclopean walls, whose huge rough blocks still overhang the\r\nmodern carriage road that leads past Boccaccio's Valley of the Ladies\r\nand Fra Angelico's earliest convent from the town in the Valley. They\r\nare attributed to the Etruscans, of course, on much the same grounds as\r\nStonehenge is attributed to the Druids--because in the minds of the\r\npeople who made the attribution Etruscans and Druids were each in their\r\nown place the _ne plus ultra_ of aboriginal antiquity. But at any rate,\r\nat some very early time, the people who held the valley of the Arno\r\nerected these vast megalithic walls round their city and citadel as a\r\nprotection, probably, against the people who held the Ligurian\r\nsea-board. Throughout the early historical period at least we know that\r\nFæsulæ was an Etruscan border-town against the Ligurian freebooters,\r\nand we can see that the arx or acropolis of Fæsulæ must have occupied\r\nthe hill-top now occupied by the Franciscan monastery on the height\r\nabove the town, while the houses must have spread, as they still do\r\nwithin shrunken limits, about the spring and over the _col_ at its\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nFæsulæ was not one of the great Etrurian cities, not one of the twelve\r\ncities of the Etruscan League. Volterra occupies the site of the large\r\nTuscan town which lorded it over this part of the Lower Apennines. But\r\nFæsulæ must still have been a considerable place, to judge by the\r\nmagnitude and importance of its fortifications, and it must have\r\ngathered into itself the entire population of all the little Arno\r\nplain. As long as _fortis Etruria crevit_, Fæsulæ must always have held\r\nits own as a frontier post against the Ligurian foe. But when _fortis\r\nEtruria_ began to decline, and Rome to become the summit of all things,\r\nthe glory of Fæsulæ received a severe shock. Not indeed by\r\nconquest--that counts for little--but the Roman peace introduced into\r\nItaly a new order of things, fatal to the hill-tops. Sulla, who humbled\r\nFæsulæ, did far worse than that: he planted a Roman colony in the\r\nvalley at its foot--the colony of Florentia--at the point where the\r\nroad crossed the Arno--the colony that was afterwards to become the\r\nmost famous commercial and artistic town of the mediæval world as\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nThe position of the new town marks the change that had come over the\r\nconditions of life in Upper Italy. Florence was a Fiesole descended to\r\nthe plain. And it descended for just the selfsame reason that made\r\nBishop Poore thirteen centuries later bring down Sarum from its lofty\r\nhill-top to the new white minster by the ford of Avon. Roads,\r\ncommunications, internal trade were henceforth to exist and to count\r\nfor much; what was needed now was a post and trading town on the river\r\nto guard the passage from north to south against possible aggression.\r\nFiesole had been but a mountain stronghold; Florence was marked from\r\nthe very beginning by its mere position as a great commercial and\r\nmanufacturing town.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, just as in mediæval England the upper town on the hill,\r\nthe castled town of the barons, often existed for many years side by\r\nside with the lower town on the river, the high-road town of the\r\nmerchant guilds--just as Old Sarum, for example, continued to exist\r\nside by side with Salisbury--so Fæsulæ continued to exist side by side\r\nwith Florentia. As a military post, commanding the plain, it was\r\nneedful to retain it; and so, though Sulla destroyed in part its\r\npopulation, he reinstated it before long as one of his own Roman\r\ncolonies. And for a long time, during the ages of doubtful peace that\r\nsucceeded the first glorious flush of the military empire, Fæsulæ must\r\nhave kept up its importance unchanged. The remains of the Roman theatre\r\non the slope behind the cathedral--great stone semicircles carved on a\r\nscale to seat a large audience--betoken a considerable Roman town. And\r\nfrom a very early period it seems to have possessed a Christian church,\r\nwhose first bishop, according to a tradition as good as most, was a\r\nconvert of St. Peter's, and was martyred, says his legend, in the\r\nNeronian persecution. The existing cathedral, its later representative,\r\nis still an early and very simple Tuscan basilica, with picturesque\r\ncrypt and raised choir, of a very plain Romanesque type. It looks like\r\na fitting church for the mother-town of Florence; it seems to recall in\r\nits own cold and austere fabric the more ancient claims of the sombre\r\nEtruscan hill-top city.\r\n\r\nIt was the middle ages, however, that finally brought down Fiesole in\r\nearnest to the plain. Pisa had been the earliest Tuscan town to attain\r\nimportance and maritime supremacy after the dark days of barbarian\r\nincursion; but as soon as land-transit once more assumed general\r\nimportance, Florence, seated on the great route from the north to Rome\r\nby Siena, and commanding the passage of the Arno and the gate of the\r\nApennines, naturally began to surpass in time its distanced rival. As\r\nearly as the Roman days a bridge is said to have spanned the Arno on\r\nthe site of the existing Ponte Vecchio. The mediæval walls enclosed the\r\nsouthern _tête du pont_ within their picturesque circuit, thus securing\r\nthe passage of the river and giving Florence its little Janiculus, the\r\nOltrarno, with its southern exit by the Porta Romana. The real 'makers\r\nof Florence' were the humble workmen who thus extended the firm hold of\r\nthe growing republic to the southern bank. By so doing, they gave their\r\ncity undoubted command of the imperial route from Germany Romeward, and\r\nbrought in their train Dante and Giotto, Brunelleschi and Donatello,\r\nFra Angelico and Savonarola, the Medici and the Pitti, Michael Angelo\r\nand Raffaele, and all the glories of the Renaissance epoch. For as at\r\nAthens, so in Florence, art and literature followed plainly in the wake\r\nof commerce. But the rise of Florence was the fall of Fiesole. Already\r\nin the eleventh century the undutiful daughter had conquered and\r\nannexed her venerable mother; and in proportion as the mercantile\r\nimportance of the city in the plain waxed greater and greater, that of\r\nthe city on the hill-top must slowly have waned to less and less. At\r\nthe present day Fiesole has degenerated into a mere suburb of Florence,\r\nwhich, indeed, it had almost become when Lorenzo the Magnificent held\r\nhis country court at the Villa Mozzi, or even earlier, when Boccaccio's\r\nlively narrators fled from the plague to the gardens of the Palmieri,\r\nthough it still retains the dignity of its ancient cathedral, its\r\nmunicipal palace, its gigantic seminary, and its great overgrown\r\nFranciscan monastery, that replaces the citadel on the height above the\r\ntown. Nay, more, with its local museum, its bishop's palace, and its\r\nquaint churches, it keeps up, to some extent, all the airs and graces\r\nof a real living town. But in reality these few big buildings, and the\r\ngraceful campanile which makes so fair a show in all the neighbouring\r\nviews, are the best of the little city. Fiesole looks biggest seen from\r\nafar. All that is vital in it is the ecclesiastical establishment,\r\nwhich still clings, with true ecclesiastical conservatism, to the\r\nhill-top city, and the trade of the straw plaiters, who make Leghorn\r\nstraw goods and pester the visitor with their flimsy wares, taking no\r\nanswer to all their importunities save one in solid coin of good King\r\nUmberto.\r\n\r\nOne last question. How does it come that in these southern climates the\r\nhill-top town has survived so much more generally to our own day than\r\nin Northern Europe? The obvious answer seems at first sight to be that\r\nin the warmer climates life can be carried on comfortably, and\r\nagriculture can yield good results, at a greater height than in a cold\r\nclimate. Olives, vines, chestnuts, maize will grow far up on Italian\r\nhill sides, and that, no doubt, counts for something; but I do not\r\nbelieve it covers all the ground. Two other points seem to me at least\r\nequally important, especially when we remember that the hill-top town\r\nwas once as common in the north as in the south, and that what we have\r\nreally to account for in Italy is not its existence merely, but rather\r\nits late survival into newer epochs. One point is that in Southern\r\nEurope the state of perpetual internal warfare lasted much longer than\r\nin the feudal north. The other point is that each little patch of\r\ncountry in the south is still far more self-supporting, has had its\r\neconomic conditions far less disturbed by modern rearrangements and\r\ncommercial necessities, than in Northern Europe. In England every town\r\nand village stands upon some high road; the larger stand almost\r\ninvariably upon some railway or some navigable river. In Italy it is\r\nstill quite possible, where agricultural conditions are favourable, to\r\nhave a comparatively flourishing town perched upon some out-of-the-way\r\nmountain height. Even a carriage road is scarcely a necessity; a mule\r\npath will do well enough for wine and oil and the other simple\r\ncommodities of southern life. The hill-top town, in short, belongs to\r\nan earlier type of civilisation than ours; it survives, unaltered, on\r\nits own pinnacle wherever that type of civilisation is still possible.\r\n\r\nAnd I sincerely hope our pretty American friend will pardon me for\r\nhaving thus publicly answered, at so great length, her natural\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    A PERSISTENT NATIONALITY.\r\n\r\nStanding to-day before the dim outline of Orcagna's \"Hell\" in the\r\nChurch of Santa Maria Novella, at Florence, and mentally comparing\r\nthose mediæval demons and monsters and torturers on the frescoed wall\r\nin front of me with the more antique Etruscan devils and tormentors\r\npictured centuries earlier on the ancient tombs of Etrurian princes,\r\nthe thought, which had often occurred to me before, how essentially\r\nsimilar were the Tuscan intellect and Tuscan art in all ages, forced\r\nitself upon me once more at a flash with an irresistible burst of\r\ninternal conviction. The identity of old and new seemed to stand\r\nconfessed. Etruria throughout has been one and the same; and it is\r\nalmost impossible for any one to over-estimate the influence of the\r\npowerful, but gloomy, Etruscan character upon the whole tone, not only\r\nof popular Christianity, but of that modern civilisation which is its\r\noffspring and outcome.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is hardly necessary, \"in this age of enlightenment\" (as\r\npeople used to say in the last century), to insist any longer upon the\r\nobvious fact that conquest and absorption do not in any way mean\r\nextermination. Most people still vaguely fancy to themselves, to be\r\nsure, that, when Rome conquered and absorbed Etruria, the ancient\r\nEtruscan ceased at once to exist--was swallowed, as it were, and became\r\nforthwith, in some mysterious way, first a Roman, and then a modern\r\nItalian. And, in a certain sense, this is, no doubt, more or less true;\r\nbut that sense is decidedly not the genealogical one. Manners change,\r\nbut blood persists. The Tuscan people went on living and marrying under\r\nconsul and emperor just as they had done under _lar_ and _lucumo_;\r\nLatin and Gaul, Lombard and Goth, mingled with them in time, but did\r\nnot efface them; and I do not doubt that the vast mass of the\r\npopulation of Tuscany at the present day is still of preponderatingly\r\nEtruscan blood, though qualified, of course (and perhaps improved), by\r\nmany Italic, Celtic, and Teutonic elements.\r\n\r\nAgain, when we remember that Florence, Pisa, Siena, Perugia are all\r\npractically in Tuscany, and that Florence alone has really given to the\r\nworld Dante and Boccaccio, Galileo and Savonarola, Cimabue and Giotto,\r\nBotticelli and Fra Angelico, Donatello and Ghiberti, Michael Angelo and\r\nRaffael, Leonardo da Vinci and Macchiavelli and Alfieri, and a host of\r\nother almost equally great names, it will be obvious to every one that\r\nthe problem of the origin of this Tuscan nationality must be one that\r\nprofoundly interests the whole world. Nay, more, we must remember, too,\r\nthat Etruria had other and earlier claims than these; that it spread up\r\nto the very walls of Rome; that the Etruscan element in Rome itself was\r\nimmensely strong; that the Roman religion owed, confessedly, much to\r\nTuscan ideas; that Latin Christianity, the Christianity of all the\r\nWestern world, took its shape in semi-Tuscan Rome; that the Roman\r\nEmpire was largely modelled by the Etruscan Mæcenas; that the Italian\r\nrenaissance was largely influenced by the Florentine Medici; that Leo\r\nthe Tenth was himself a member of that great house; and that the\r\nartists whom he summoned to the metropolis to erect St. Peter's and to\r\nbeautify the Vatican were, almost all of them, Florentines by birth,\r\ntraining, or domicile. I think, when we have run over mentally these\r\nand ten thousand other like facts, we will readily admit to ourselves\r\nthe magnitude of the world's debt to Tuscany--social, artistic,\r\nintellectual, religious--both in ancient, mediæval, and modern times.\r\n\r\nAnd what, now, was this strong Tuscan nationality, which persists so\r\nthoroughly through all external historical changes, and which has\r\ncontributed so large and so marvellous a part to the world's thought\r\nand the world's culture? It is a curious consideration for those who\r\ntalk so glibly, about the enormous natural superiority of the Aryan\r\nrace, that the ancient Etruscans were the one people of the antique\r\nEuropean world, who, by common consent, did _not_ belong to the Aryan\r\nfamily. They were strangers in the land, or, rather, perhaps they were\r\nits oldest possessors. Their language, their physique, their creed,\r\ntheir art, all point to a wholly different origin from the Aryans. I am\r\nnot going, in a brief essay like this, to settle dogmatically,\r\noff-hand, the vexed question of the origin and affinities of the\r\nEtruscan type; more nonsense, I suppose, has been talked and written\r\nupon that occult subject by learned men than even learned men have ever\r\npoured forth upon any other sublunary topic; but one thing at least, I\r\ntake it, is absolutely certain amid the conflicting theories of\r\ningenious theorists about the Etruscan race, and that one thing is that\r\nthe Rasennæ stand in Europe absolutely alone, the sole representatives\r\nof some ancient and elsewhere exterminated stock, surviving only in\r\nTuscany itself, and in the Rhætian Alps of the Canton Grisons.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the Etruscans first appear in history, however, they\r\nappear as a race capable of acquiring and assimilating culture with\r\ngreat ease, rapidity, and certainty. No sooner do they come into\r\ncontact with the Greek world than they absorb and reproduce all that\r\nwas best and truest in Greek civilization. 'Merely receptive--European\r\nChinese,' says, in effect, Mommsen, the great Roman historian: to me,\r\nthat judgment, though true in some small degree, seems harsh indeed on\r\na wider view, when applied to a people who begot at last the 'Divina\r\nCommedia,' the campanile of Florence, the dome of St. Peter's, and the\r\nglories of the Uffizi and the Pitti Palace. It is quite true that the\r\nEtruscans themselves, like the Japanese in our own time, did at first\r\naccept most imitatively the Hellenic culture; but they gradually\r\nremoulded it by their own effort into something new, growing and\r\nchanging from age to age, until at last, in the Italian renaissance,\r\nthey burst out with a wonderful and novel message to all the rest of\r\ndormant Europe.\r\n\r\nOne of the most persistent key-notes of this underlying Etruscan\r\ncharacter is the solemn, weird, and gloomy nature of so much of the\r\ntrue Etruscan workmanship. From the very beginning they are strong, but\r\nsullen. Solidity and power, rather than beauty and grace, are what they\r\naim at; and in this, Michael Angelo was a true Tuscan. If we look at\r\nthe massive old Etruscan buildings, the Cyclopean walls of Fæsulæ and\r\nVolterræ, with their gigantic unhewn blocks, or the gloomy tombs of\r\nClusium, with their heavy portals, and then at the frowning façade of\r\nthe Strozzi or the Pitti Palace, we shall see in these, their earliest\r\nand latest terms, the special marks of Tuscan architecture. 'Piled by\r\nthe hands of giants for mighty kings of old,' says Macaulay, well, of\r\nthe Cyclopean walls. 'It somewhat resembles a prison or castle, and is\r\nremarkable for its bold simplicity of style, the unadorned huge blocks\r\nof stone being hewn smooth at the joints only,' says a modern writer,\r\nof Brunelleschi's palatial masterpiece. Every visitor to Florence must\r\nhave noticed on every side the marks of this sullen and rugged Etruscan\r\ncharacter. Compare for a moment the dark bosses of the Palazzo Strozzi,\r\nthe '_âpre énergie_' of the Palazzo Vecchio, the '_beauté sombre et\r\nsévère_' of the mediæval Bargello, with the open, airy brightness of\r\nthe Doge's Palace, or the glorious Byzantine gold-and-blue of St.\r\nMark's at Venice, and you get at once an admirable measure of this\r\npersistent trait in the Etruscan idiosyncrasy. Tuscan architecture is\r\nmassive and morose where Venetian architecture is sunny and smiling.\r\n\r\nNow, Tuscan religion has in all times been specially influenced by the\r\npeculiarly gloomy tinge of the Tuscan character. It has always been a\r\nreligion of fear rather than of love; a religion that strove harder to\r\nterrorize than to attract; a religion full of devils, flames, tortures,\r\nand horrors; in short, a sort of horrible Chinese religion of dragons\r\nand monstrosities, and flames and goblins. In the painted tombs of\r\nancient Etruria you may see the familiar devil with his three-pronged\r\nfork thrusting souls back into the seething flood of a heathen hell, as\r\nOrcagna's here thrust them back similarly into that of its more modern\r\nChristian successor. All Etruscan art is full throughout of such\r\nhorrors. You find their traces abundantly in the antique Etruscan\r\nmuseum at Florence; you find them on the mediæval Campo Santo at Pisa;\r\nyou find them with greater skill, but equal repulsiveness, in the work\r\nof the great Renaissance artists. The 'ghastly glories of saints' the\r\nTuscan revels in. The most famous portion of the most famous Tuscan\r\npoem is the 'Inferno'--the part that gloats with minute and truly\r\nTuscan realism over the torments of the damned in every department of\r\nthe mediæval hell. And, as if still further to mark the continuity of\r\nthought, here in Orcagna's frescoes at Santa Maria Novella you have\r\nevery horror of the heathen religion incongruously mingled with every\r\nhorror of the Christian--gorgons and harpies and chimæras dire are\r\ntormenting the wicked under the eyes of the Madonna; centaurs are\r\nshooting and prodding them before the God of Love from the torrid banks\r\nof fiery lakes; furies with snaky heads are directing their\r\npunishments; Minos and Æacus are superintending their tasks; and, in\r\nthe centre of all, a huge Moloch demon is devouring them bodily in his\r\nfiery jaws, with hideous tusks as of a Japanese monster.\r\n\r\nIt would be a curious question to inquire how far these old and\r\ningrained Etruscan ideas may have helped to modify and colour the\r\ngentler conceptions of primitive Christianity. Certainly, one must\r\nnever for a moment forget that Rome was at bottom nearly one-half\r\nEtruscan in character; that during the imperial period it became, in\r\nfact, the capital of Etruria; that myriads of Etruscans flocked to\r\nRome; and that many of them, like Sejanus, had much to do with moulding\r\nand building up the imperial system. I do not doubt, myself, that\r\nEtruscan notions large interwove themselves, from the very outset, with\r\nRoman Christianity; and whenever in the churches or galleries of Italy\r\nI see St. Lawrence frying on his gridiron, or St. Sebastian pierced\r\nthrough with many arrows, or the Innocents being massacred in\r\nunpleasant detail, or hell being represented with Dantesque minuteness\r\nand particularity of delineation, I say to myself, with an internal\r\nsmile, 'Etruscan influence.'\r\n\r\nHow interesting it is, too, to observe the constant outcrop, under all\r\nforms and faiths, of this strange, underlying, non-Aryan type! The\r\nEtruscans are and always were remarkable for their intellect, their\r\ningenuity, their artistic faculty; and even to this day, after so many\r\nvicissitudes, they stand out as a wholly superior people to the rough\r\nGenoese and the indolent Neapolitans. They have had many crosses of\r\nblood meanwhile, of course; and it seems probable that the crosses have\r\ndone them good: for in ancient times it was Rome, the Etrurianised\r\nborder city of the Latins, that rose to greatness, not Etruria itself;\r\nand at a later date, it was after the Germans had mingled their race\r\nwith Italy that Florence almost took the place of Rome. Nay, it is\r\nknown as a fact that under Otto the Great a large Teutonic colony\r\nsettled in Florence, thus adding to the native Etrurian race\r\n(especially to the nobility) that other element which the Tuscan seems\r\nto need in order that he may be spurred to the realisation of his best\r\ncharacteristics. But allow as we may for foreign admixture, two points\r\nare abundantly clear to the impartial observer of Tuscan history: one,\r\nthat this non-Aryan race has always been one of the finest and\r\nstrongest in Italy; and the other, that from the very dawn of history\r\nits main characteristics, for good or for evil, have persisted most\r\nuninterruptedly till the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CASTERS AND CHESTERS.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows, of course, that up and down over the face of England a\r\nwhole crop of places may be found with such terminations as Lancaster,\r\nDoncaster, Manchester, Leicester, Gloucester, or Exeter; and everybody\r\nalso knows that these words are various corruptions or alterations of\r\nthe Latin _castra_, or perhaps we ought rather to say of the singular\r\nform, _castrum_. So much we have all been told from our childhood\r\nupward; and for the most part we have been quite ready to acquiesce in\r\nthe statement without any further troublesome inquiry on our own\r\naccount. But in reality the explanation thus vouchsafed us does not\r\nhelp us much towards explaining the real origin and nature of these\r\nancient names. It is true enough as far as it goes, but it does not go\r\nnearly far enough. It reminds one a little of Charles Kingsley's\r\naccomplished pupil-teacher, with his glib derivation of amphibious,\r\n'from two Greek words, _amphi_, the land, and _bios_, the water.' A\r\ndetailed history of the root 'Chester' in its various British usages\r\nmay serve to show how far such a rough-and-ready solution as the\r\npupil-teacher's falls short of complete accuracy and comprehensiveness.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, without troubling ourselves for the time being with\r\nthe diverse forms of the word as now existing, a difficulty meets us at\r\nthe very outset as to how it ever got into the English language at all.\r\n'It was left behind by the Romans,' says the pupil teacher\r\nunhesitatingly. No doubt; but if so, the only language in which it\r\ncould be left would be Welsh; for when the Romans quitted Britain there\r\nwere probably as yet no English settlements on any part of the eastern\r\ncoast. Now the Welsh form of the word, even as given us in the very\r\nancient Latin Welsh tract ascribed to Nennius, is 'Caer' or 'Kair;' and\r\nthere is every reason to believe that the Celtic _cathir_ or the Latin\r\n_castrum_ had been already worn down into this corrupt form at least as\r\nearly as the days of the first English colonisation of Britain. Indeed\r\nI shall show ground hereafter for believing that that form survives\r\neven now in one or two parts of Teutonic England. But if this be so, it\r\nis quite clear that the earliest English conquerors could not have\r\nacquired the use of the word from the vanquished Welsh whom they spared\r\nas slaves or tributaries. The newcomers could not have learned to speak\r\nof a Ceaster or Chester from Welshmen who called it a Caer; nor could\r\nthey have adopted the names of Leicester or Gloucester from Welshmen\r\nwho knew those towns only as Kair Legion or Kair Gloui. It is clear\r\nthat this easy off-hand theory shirks all the real difficulties of the\r\nquestion, and that we must look a little closer into the matter in\r\norder to understand the true history of these interesting philological\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\nAlready we have got one clear and distinct principle to begin with,\r\nwhich is too often overlooked by amateur philologists. The Latin\r\nlanguage, as spoken by Romans in Britain during their occupation of the\r\nisland, has left and can have left absolutely no directs marks upon our\r\nEnglish tongue, for the simple reason that English (or Anglo-Saxon as\r\nwe call it in its earlier stages) did not begin to be spoken in any\r\npart of Britain for twenty or thirty years after the Romans retired.\r\nWhatever Latin words have come down to us in unbroken succession from\r\nthe Roman times--and they are but a few--must have come down from Welsh\r\nsources. The Britons may have learnt them from their Italian masters,\r\nand may then have imparted them, after the brief period of precarious\r\nindependence, to their Teutonic masters; but of direct intercourse\r\nbetween Roman and Englishman there was probably little or none.\r\n\r\nThree ways out of this difficulty might possibly be suggested by any\r\nhumble imitator of Mr. Gladstone. First, the early English pirates may\r\nhave learnt the word _castrum_ (they always used it as a singular)\r\nyears before they ever came to Britain as settlers at all. For during\r\nthe long decay of the empire, the corsairs of the flat banks and islets\r\nof Sleswick and Friesland made many a light-hearted plundering\r\nexpedition upon the unlucky coasts of the maritime Roman provinces; and\r\nit was to repel their dreaded attacks that the Count of the Saxon Shore\r\nwas appointed to the charge of the long exposed tract from the fenland\r\nof the Wash to the estuary of the Rother in Sussex. On one occasion\r\nthey even sacked London itself, already the chief trading town of the\r\nwhole island. During some such excursions, the pirates would be certain\r\nto pick up a few Latin words, especially such as related to new\r\nobjects, unseen in the rude society of their own native heather-clad\r\nwastes; and amongst these we may be sure that the great Roman\r\nfortresses would rank first and highest in their barbaric eyes. Indeed,\r\nmodern comparative philologists have shown beyond doubt that a few\r\nsouthern forms of speech had already penetrated to the primitive\r\nEnglish marshland by the shores of the Baltic and the mouth of the Elbe\r\nbefore the great exodus of the fifth century; and we know that Roman or\r\nByzantine coins, and other objects belonging to the Mediterranean\r\ncivilisation, are found abundantly in barrows of the first Christian\r\ncenturies in Sleswick--the primitive England of the colonists who\r\nconquered Britain. But if the word _castrum_ did not get into early\r\nEnglish by some such means, then we must fall back either upon our\r\nsecond alternative explanation, that the townspeople of the\r\nsouth-eastern plains in England had become thoroughly Latinised in\r\nspeech during the Roman occupation; or upon our third, that they spoke\r\na Celtic dialect more akin to Gaulish than the modern Welsh of Wales,\r\nwhich may be descended from the ruder and older tongue of the western\r\naborigines. This last opinion would fit in very well with the views of\r\nMr. Rhys, the Celtic professor at Oxford, who thinks that all\r\nsouth-eastern Britain was conquered and colonised by the Gauls before\r\nthe Roman invasion. If so, it maybe only the western Welsh who said\r\nCaer; the eastern may have said _castrum_, as the Romans did. In either\r\nof the latter two cases, we must suppose that the early English learnt\r\nthe word from the conquered Britons of the districts they overran. But\r\nI myself have very little doubt that they had borrowed it long before\r\ntheir settlement in our island at all.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be--and I confess I have been a little puritanically\r\nminute upon the subject--the English settlers learned to use the word\r\nfrom the first moment they landed in Britain. In its earliest English\r\ndress it appears as Ceaster, pronounced like Keaster, for the soft\r\nsound of the initial in modern English is due to later Norman\r\ninfluences. The new comers--Anglo-Saxons, if you choose to call them\r\nso--applied the word to every Roman town or ruin they found in Britain.\r\nIndeed, all the Latin words of the first crop in English--those used\r\nduring the heathen age, before Augustine and his monks introduced the\r\nRoman civilisation--belong to such material relics of the older\r\nprovincial culture as the Sleswick pirates had never before known:\r\n_way_ from _via_, _wall_ from _vallum_, _street_ from _strata_, and\r\n_port_ from _portus_. In this first crop of foreign words Ceaster also\r\nmust be reckoned, and it was originally employed in English as a common\r\nrather than as a proper name. Thus we read in the brief _Chronicle_ of\r\nthe West Saxon kings, under the year 577, 'Cuthwine and Ceawlin fought\r\nagainst the Welsh, and offslew three kings, Conmail and Condidan and\r\nFarinmail, and took three ceasters, Gleawan ceaster and Ciren ceaster\r\nand Bathan ceaster.' We might modernise a little, so as to show the\r\nreal sense, by saying 'Glevum city and Corinium city and Bath city.'\r\nHere it is noticeable that in two of the cases--Gloucester and\r\nCirencester--the descriptive termination has become at last part of the\r\nname; but in the third case--that of Bath--it has never succeeded in\r\ndoing so. Ages after, in the reign of King Alfred, we still find the\r\nword used as a common noun; for the _Chronicle_ mentions that a body of\r\nDanish freebooters 'fared to a waste ceaster in Wirral; it is hight\r\nLega ceaster;' that is to say, Legionis castra, now Chester. The grand\r\nold English epic of Beowulf, which is perhaps older than the\r\ncolonisation of Britain, speaks of townsfolk as 'the dwellers in\r\nceasters.'\r\n\r\nAs a rule, each particular Roman town retained its full name, in a more\r\nor less clipped form, for official uses; but in the ordinary colloquial\r\nlanguage of the neighbourhood they all seem to have been described as\r\n'the Ceaster' simply, just as we ourselves habitually speak of 'town,'\r\nmeaning the particular town near which we live, or, in a more general\r\nsense, London. Thus, in the north, Ceaster usually means York, the\r\nRoman capital of the province; as when the _Chronicle_ tells us that\r\n'John succeeded to the bishopric of Ceaster'; that 'Wilfrith was\r\nhallowed as bishop at Ceaster'; or that 'Æthelberht the archbishop died\r\nat Ceaster.' In the south it is employed to mean Winchester, the\r\ncapital of the West Saxon kings and overlords of all Britain; as when\r\nthe _Chronicle_ says that 'King Edgar drove out the priests at Ceaster\r\nfrom the Old Minster and the New Minster, and set them with monks.' So,\r\nas late as the days of Charles II., 'to go to town' meant in Shropshire\r\nto go to Shrewsbury, and in Norfolk to go to Norwich. In only one\r\ninstance has this colloquial usage survived down to our own days in a\r\nlarge town, and that is at Chester, where the short form has quite\r\nousted the full name of Lega ceaster. But in the case of small towns or\r\nunimportant Roman stations, which would seldom need to be mentioned\r\noutside their own immediate neighbourhood, the simple form is quite\r\ncommon, as at Caistor in Norfolk, Castor in Hunts, and elsewhere. At\r\ntimes, too, we get an added English termination, as at Casterton,\r\nChesterton, and Chesterholme; or a slight distinguishing mark, as at\r\nGreat Chesters, Little Chester, Bridge Casterton, and Chester-le-Street.\r\nAll these have now quite lost their old distinctive names, though they\r\nhave acquired new ones to distinguish them from _the_ Chester, or from\r\none another. For example, Chester-le-Street was Conderco in Roman\r\ntimes, and Cunega ceaster in the early English period. Both names are\r\nderived from the little river Cone, which flows through the village.\r\n\r\nBefore we pass on to the consideration of those _castra_ which, like\r\nManchester and Lancaster, have preserved to the present day their\r\noriginal Roman or Celtic prefixes in more or less altered shapes, we\r\nmust glance briefly at a general principle running through the\r\nmodernised forms now in use. The reader, with his usual acuteness, will\r\nhave noticed that the word Ceaster reappears under many separate\r\ndisguises in the names of different modern towns. Sometimes it is\r\n_caster_, sometimes _chester_, sometimes _cester_, and sometimes even\r\nit gets worn down to a mere fugitive relic, as _ceter_ or _eter_. But\r\nthese different corruptions do not occur irregularly up and down the\r\ncountry, one here and one there; they follow a distinct law and are due\r\nto certain definite underlying facts of race or language. Each set of\r\nnames lies in a regular stratum; and the different strata succeed one\r\nanother like waves over the face of England, from north-east to\r\nsouth-westward. In the extreme north and east, where the English or\r\nAnglian blood is purest, or is mixed only with Danes and Northmen to\r\nany large extent, such forms as Lancaster, Doncaster, Caistor, and\r\nCasterton abound. In the mixed midlands and the Saxon south, the sound\r\nsoftens into Chesterfield, Chester, Winchester, and Dorchester. In the\r\ninner midlands and the Severn vale, where the proportion of Celtic\r\nblood becomes much stronger, the termination grows still softer in\r\nLeicester, Bicester, Cirencester, Gloucester, and Worcester, while at\r\nthe same time a marked tendency towards elision occurs; for these words\r\nare really pronounced as if written Lester, Bister, Cisseter, Gloster,\r\nand Wooster. Finally, on the very borders of Wales, and of that\r\nDamnonian country which was once known to our fathers as West Wales, we\r\nget the very abbreviated forms Wroxeter, Uttoxeter, and Exeter, of\r\nwhich the second is colloquially still further shortened into Uxeter.\r\nSometimes these tracts approach very closely to one another, as on the\r\nbanks of the Nene, where the two halves of the Roman Durobrivæ have\r\nbecome castor on one side of the river, and Chesterton on the other;\r\nbut the line can be marked distinctly on the map, with a slight outward\r\nbulge, with as great regularity as the geological strata. It will be\r\nmost convenient here, therefore, to begin with the _casters_, which\r\nhave undergone the least amount of rubbing down, and from them to pass\r\non regularly to the successively weaker forms in _chester_, _cester_,\r\n_ceter_, and _eter_.\r\n\r\nNothing, indeed, can be more deceptive than the common fashion, of\r\nquoting a Roman name from the often blundering lists of the\r\nItineraries, and then passing on at once to the modern English form,\r\nwithout any hint of the intermediate stages. To say that Glevum is now\r\nGloucester is to tell only half the truth; until we know that the two\r\nwere linked together by the gradual steps of Glevum castrum, Gleawan\r\nceaster, Gleawe cester, Gloucester, and Gloster, we have not really\r\nexplained the words at all. By beginning with the least corrupt forms\r\nwe shall best be able to see the slow nature of the change, and we\r\nshall also find at the same time that a good deal of incidental light\r\nis shed upon the importance and extent of the English settlement.\r\n\r\nDoncaster is an excellent example of the simplest form of\r\nmodernisation. It appears in the Antonine Itinerary and in the _Notitia\r\nImperii_ as Danum. This, with the ordinary termination affixed, becomes\r\nat once Dona ceaster or Doncaster. The name is of course originally\r\nderived in either form from the river Don, which flows beside it; and\r\nthe Northumbrian invaders must have learnt the names of both river and\r\nstation from their Brigantian British serfs. It shows the fluctuating\r\nnature of the early local nomenclature, however, when we find that Bæda\r\n('the Venerable Bede') describes the place in his Latinised vocabulary\r\nas Campodonum--that is to say, the Field of Don, or, more\r\nidiomatically, Donfield, a name exactly analogous to those of\r\nChesterfield Macclesfield, Mansfield, Sheffield, and Huddersfield in\r\nthe neighbouring region. The comparison of Doncaster and Chesterfield\r\nis thus most interesting: for here we have two Roman Stations, each of\r\nwhich must once have had two alternative names; but in the one case the\r\nold Roman name has ultimately prevailed, and in the other case the\r\nmodern English one.\r\n\r\nThe second best example of a Caster, perhaps, is Lancaster. In all\r\nprobability this is the station which appears in the _Notitia Imperii_\r\nas Longovico, an oblique case which it might be hazardous to put in the\r\nnominative, seeing that it seems rather to mean the town on the Lune or\r\nLoan than the Long Village. Here, as in many other cases, the formative\r\nelement, vicus, is exchanged for Ceaster, and we get something like\r\nLon-ceaster or finally Lancaster. Other remarkable Casters are\r\nBrancaster in Norfolk, once Branadunum (where the British termination\r\n_dun_ has been similarly dropped); Ancaster in Lincolnshire, whose\r\nRoman name is not certainly known; and Caistor, near Norwich, once\r\nVenta Icenorum, a case which may best be considered under the head of\r\nWinchester. On the other hand, Tadcaster gives us an instance where the\r\nRoman prefix has apparently been entirely altered, for it appears in\r\nthe Antonine Itinerary (according to the best identification) as\r\nCalcaria, so that we might reasonably expect it to be modernised as\r\nCalcaster. Even here, however, we might well suspect an earlier\r\nalternative title, of which we shall get plenty when we come to examine\r\nthe Chesters; and in fact, in Bæda, it still bears its old name in a\r\nslightly disguised form as Kaelca ceaster.\r\n\r\nFirst among the softer forms, let us examine the interesting group to\r\nwhich Chester itself belongs. Its Roman name was, beyond doubt, Diva,\r\nthe station on the Dee--as Doncaster is the station on the Don, and\r\nLancaster the station on the Lune. Its proper modern form ought,\r\ntherefore, to be Deechester. But it would seem that in certain places\r\nthe neighbouring rustics knew the great Roman town of their district,\r\nnot by its official title, but as the legion's Camp--Castra Legionis.\r\nAt least three such cases undoubtedly occur--one at Deva or Chester;\r\none at Ratæ or Leicester; and one at Isca Silurum or Caerleon-upon-Usk.\r\nIn each case the modernisation has taken a very different form. Diva\r\nwas captured by the heathen English king, Æthelfrith of Northumbria, in\r\na battle rendered famous by Bæda, who calls the place 'The City of\r\nLegions.' The Latin compilation by some Welsh writer, ascribed to\r\nNennius, calls it Cair Legion, which is also its name in the Irish\r\nannals. In the _English Chronicle_ it appears as Lege ceaster, Læge\r\nceaster, and Leg ceaster; but after the Norman Conquest it becomes\r\nCeaster alone. On midland lips the sound soon grew into the familiar\r\nChester. About the second case, that of Leicester, there is a slight\r\ndifficulty, for it assumes in the _Chronicle_ the form of Lægra\r\nceaster, with an apparently intrusive letter; and the later Welsh\r\nwriters seized upon the form to fit in with their own ancient legend of\r\nKing Lear. Nennius calls it Cair Lerion; and that unblushing romancer,\r\nGeoffrey of Monmouth, makes it at once into Cair Leir, the city of\r\nLeir. More probably the name is a mixture of Legionis and Ratæ, Leg-rat\r\nceaster, the camp of the Legion at Ratæ. This, again, grew into Legra\r\nceaster, Leg ceaster, and Lei ceaster, while the word, though written\r\nLeicester, is now shortened by south midland voices to Lester. The\r\nthird Legionis Castra remained always Welsh, and so hardened on Cymric\r\nlips into Kair Leon or Caerleon. Nennius applies the very similar name\r\nof Cair Legeion to Exeter, still in his time a Damnonian or West Welsh\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\nEqually interesting have been the fortunes of the three towns of which\r\nWinchester is the type. In the old Welsh tongue, Gwent means a\r\nchampaign country, or level alluvial plain. The Romans borrowed the\r\nword as Venta, and applied it to the three local centres of Venta\r\nIcenorum in Norfolk, Venta Belgarum in Hampshire, and Venta Silurum in\r\nMonmouth. When the first West Saxon pirates, under their real or\r\nmythical leader, Cerdic, swarmed up Southampton Water and occupied the\r\nGwent of the Belgæ, they called their new conquest Wintan ceaster,\r\nthough the still closer form Wæntan once occurs. Thence to Winte\r\nceaster and Winchester is no far cry. Gwent of the Iceni had a\r\ndifferent history. No doubt it also was known at first as Wintan\r\nceaster; but, as at Winchester, the shorter form Ceaster would\r\nnaturally be employed in local colloquial usage; and when the chief\r\ncentre of East Anglian population was removed a few miles north to\r\nNorwich, the north wick--then a port on the navigable estuary of the\r\nYare--the older station sank into insignificance, and was only locally\r\nremembered as Caistor. Lastly, Gwent of the Silurians has left its name\r\nalone to Caer-Went in Monmouthshire, where hardly any relics now remain\r\nof the Roman occupation.\r\n\r\nManchester belongs to exactly the same class as Winchester. Its Roman\r\nname was Mancunium, which would easily glide into Mancunceaster. In the\r\n_English Chronicle_ it is only once mentioned, and then as\r\nMameceaster--a form explained by the alternative Mamucium in the\r\nItinerary, which would naturally become Mamue ceaster. Colchester of\r\ncourse represents Colonia, corrupted first into Coln ceaster, and so\r\nthrough Col ceaster into its present form. Porchester in Hants is\r\nPortus Magnus; Dorchester is Durnovaria, and then Dorn ceaster.\r\nGrantchester, Godmanchester, Chesterfield, Woodchester, and many others\r\nhelp us to trace the line across the map of England, to the most\r\nwestern limit of all at Ilchester, anciently Ischalis, though the\r\nintermediate form of Givel ceaster is certainly an odd one.\r\n\r\nBesides these Chesters of the regular order, there are several curious\r\noutlying instances in Durham and Northumberland, and along the Roman\r\nWall, islanded, as it were, beyond the intermediate belt of Casters.\r\nSuch are Lanchester in Durham, which maybe compared with the more\r\nfamiliar Lancaster; Great Chesters in Northumberland, Ebchester on the\r\nnorthern Watling Street, and a dozen more. How to account for these is\r\nrather a puzzle. Perhaps the Casters may be mainly due to Danish\r\ninfluence (which is the common explanation), and it is known that the\r\nDanes spread but sparingly to the north of the Tees. However, this\r\nrough solution of the problem proves too much: for how then can we have\r\na still softer form in Danish Leicester itself? Probably we shall be\r\nnearer the truth if we say that these are late names; for\r\nNorthumberland was a desert long after the great harrying by William\r\nthe Conqueror; and by the time it was repeopled, Chester had become the\r\nrecognised English form, so that it would naturally be employed by the\r\nnew occupants of the districts about the Wall.\r\n\r\nNo name in Britain, however, is more interesting than that of\r\nRochester, which admirably shows us how so many other Roman names have\r\nacquired a delusively English form, or have been mistaken for memorials\r\nof the English conquest. The Roman town was known as Durobrivæ, which\r\ndoes not in the least resemble Rochester; and what is more, Bæda\r\ndistinctly tells us that Justus, the first bishop of the West Kentish\r\nsee, was consecrated 'in the city of Dorubrevi, which the English call\r\nHrofæs ceaster, from one of its former masters, by name Hrof.' If this\r\nwere all we knew about it, we should be told that Bæda clearly\r\ndescribed the town as being called Hrof's Chester, from an English\r\nconqueror Hrof, and that to contradict this clear statement of an early\r\nwriter was presumptuous or absurd. Fortunately, however, we have the\r\nclearest possible proof that Hrof never existed, and that he was a pure\r\ncreation of Bæda's own simple etymological guesswork. King Alfred\r\nclearly knew better, for he omitted this wild derivation from his\r\nEnglish translation. The valuable fragment of a map of Roman Britain\r\npreserved for us in the mediæval transcript known as the _Peutinger\r\nTables_, sets down Rochester as Rotibis. Hence it is pretty certain\r\nthat it must have had two alternative names, of which the other was\r\nDurobrivæ. Rotibis would easily pass (on the regular analogies) into\r\nRotifi ceaster, and that again into Hrofi ceaster and Rochester; just\r\nas Rhutupiæ or Ritupæ passed into Rituf burh, and so finally into\r\nRichborough. Moreover, in a charter of King Ethelberht of Kent, older a\r\ngood deal than Bæda's time, we find the town described under the mixed\r\nform of Hrofi-brevi. After such a certain instance of philological\r\nblundering as this, I for one am not inclined to place great faith in\r\nsuch statements as that made by the _English Chronicle_ about\r\nChichester, which it attributes to the mythical South Saxon king Cissa.\r\nWhatever Cissanceaster may mean, it seems to me much more likely that\r\nit represents another case of double naming; for though the Roman town\r\nwas commonly known as Regnum, that is clearly a mere administrative\r\nform, derived from the tribal name of the Regni. Considering that the\r\nsame veracious _Chronicle_ derives Portsmouth, the Roman Portus, from\r\nan imaginary Teutonic invader, Port, and commits itself to other wild\r\nstatements of the same sort, I don't think we need greatly hesitate\r\nabout rejecting its authority in these earlier and conjectural\r\nportions.\r\n\r\nSilchester is another much disputed name. As a rule, the site has been\r\nidentified with that of Calleva Atrebatum; but the proofs are scanty,\r\nand the identification must be regarded as a doubtful one. I have\r\nalready ventured to suggest that the word may contain the root Silva,\r\nas the town is situated close upon the ancient borders of Pamber\r\nForest. The absence of early forms, however, makes this somewhat of a\r\nrandom shot. Indeed, it is difficult to arrive at any definite\r\nconclusions in these cases, except by patiently following up the name\r\nfrom first to last, through all its variations, corruptions, and\r\nmis-spellings.\r\n\r\nThe _Cesters_ are even more degraded (philologically speaking) than the\r\n_Chesters_, but are not less interesting and illustrative in their way.\r\nTheir farthest northeasterly extension, I believe, is to be found at\r\nLeicester and Towcester. The former we have already considered: the\r\nlatter appears in the _Chronicle_ as Tofe ceaster, and derives its name\r\nfrom the little river Towe, on which it is situated. Anciently, no\r\ndoubt, the river was called Tofe or Tofi, like the Tavy in Devonshire;\r\nfor all these river-words recur over and over again, both in England\r\nand on the Continent. In this case, there seems no immediate connection\r\nwith the Roman name, if the site be rightly identified with that of\r\nLactodorum; but at any rate the river name is Celtic, so that Towcester\r\ncannot be claimed as a Teutonic settlement.\r\n\r\nCirencester, the meeting-place of all the great Roman roads, is the\r\nLatin Corinium, sometimes given as Durocornovium, which well\r\nillustrates the fluctuating state of Roman nomenclature in Britain. As\r\nthis great strategical centre--the key of the west--had formerly been\r\nthe capital of the Dobuni, whose name it sometimes bears, it might\r\neasily have come down to us as Durchester, or Dobchester, instead of\r\nunder its existing guise. The city was captured by the West Saxons in\r\n577, and is then called Ciren ceaster in the brief record of the\r\nconquerors. A few years later, the _Chronicle_ gives it as Cirn\r\nceaster; and since the river is called Chirn, this is the form it might\r\nfairly have been expected to retain, as in the case of Cerney close by.\r\nBut the city was too far west not to have its name largely rubbed down\r\nin use; so it softened both its initials into Cirencester, while Cissan\r\nceaster only got (through Cisse ceaster) as far as Chichester. At that\r\npoint the spelling of the western town has stopped short, but the\r\ntongues of the natives have run on till nothing now remains but\r\nCisseter. If we had only that written form on the one hand, and\r\nDurocornovium on the other, even the boldest etymologist would hardly\r\nventure to suggest that they had any connection with one another. Of\r\ncourse the common prefix Duro, is only the Welsh Dwr, water, and its\r\noccurrence in a name merely implies a ford or river. The alternative\r\nforms may be Anglicised as Churn, and Churnwater, just like Grasmere,\r\nand Grasmere Lake.\r\n\r\nI wish I could avoid saying anything about Worcester, for it is an\r\nobscure and difficult subject; but I fear the attempt to shirk it would\r\nbe useless in the long run. I know from sad experience that if I omit\r\nit every inhabitant of Worcestershire who reads this article will hunt\r\nme out somehow, and run me to earth at last, with a letter demanding a\r\nfull and explicit explanation of this silent insult to his native\r\ncounty. So I must try to put the best possible face upon a troublesome\r\nmatter. The earliest existing form of the name, after the English\r\nConquest, seems to be that given in a Latin Charter of the eighth\r\ncentury as _Weogorna civitas_. (Here it is difficult to disentangle the\r\nEnglish from its Latin dress.) A little later it appears in a\r\nvernacular shape (also in a charter) as Wigran ceaster. In the later\r\npart of the _English Chronicle_ it becomes Wigera ceaster, and Wigra\r\nceaster; but by the twelfth century it has grown into Wigor ceaster,\r\nfrom which the change to Wire ceaster and Worcester (fully pronounced)\r\nis not violent. This is all plain sailing enough. But what is the\r\nmeaning of Wigorna ceaster or Wigran ceaster? And what Roman or English\r\nname does it represent? The old English settlers of the neighbourhood\r\nformed a little independent principality of Hwiccas (afterwards subdued\r\nby the Mercians), and some have accordingly suggested that the original\r\nword may have been Hwiccwara ceaster, the Chester of the Hwicca men,\r\nwhich would be analogous to Cant-wara burh (Canterbury), the Bury of\r\nthe Kent men, or to Wiht-gara burh (Carisbrooke), the Bury of the Wight\r\nmen. Others, again, connect it with the Braunogenium of the Ravenna\r\ngeographer, and the Cair Guoranegon or Guiragon of Nennius, which\r\nlatter is probably itself a corrupted version of the English name.\r\nAltogether, it must be allowed that Worcester presents a genuine\r\ndifficulty, and that the facts about its early forms are themselves\r\ndecidedly confused, if not contradictory. The only other notable\r\n_Ceasters_, are Alcester, once Alneceaster, in Worcestershire, the\r\nRoman Alauna; Gloucester or Glevum, already sufficiently explained; and\r\nMancester in Staffordshire, supposed to occupy the site of\r\nManduessedum.\r\n\r\nAmong the most corrupted forms of all, Exeter may rank first. Its Latin\r\nequivalent was Isca Damnoniorum, Usk of the Devonians; Isca being the\r\nLatinised form of that prevalent Celtic river name which crops up again\r\nin the Usk, Esk, Exe, and Axe, besides forming the first element of\r\nUxbridge and Oxford; while the tribal qualification was added to\r\ndistinguish it from its namesake, Isca Silurum, Usk of the Silurians,\r\nnow Caerleon-upon-Usk. In the west country, to this day, _ask_ always\r\nbecomes _ax_, or rather remains so, for that provincial form was the\r\nKing's English at the court of Alfred; and so Isca became on Devonian\r\nlips Exan ceaster, after the West Saxon conquest. Thence it passed\r\nrapidly through the stages of Exe ceaster and Exe cester till it\r\nfinally settled down into Exeter. At the same time, the river itself\r\nbecame the Exe; and the Exan-mutha of the _Chronicle_ dropped into\r\nExmouth. We must never forget, however, that Exeter, was a Welsh town\r\nup to the reign of Athelstan, and that Cornish Welsh was still spoken\r\nin parts of Devonshire till the days of Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nWroxeter is another immensely interesting fossil word. It lies just at\r\nthe foot of the Wrekin, and the hill which takes that name in English\r\nmust have been pronounced by the old Celtic inhabitants much like\r\nUricon: for of course the awkward initial letter has only become silent\r\nin these later lazy centuries. The Romans turned it into Uriconium; but\r\nafter their departure, it was captured and burnt to the ground by a\r\nparty of raiding West Saxons, and its fall is graphically described in\r\nthe wild old Welsh elegy of Llywarch the Aged. The ruins are still\r\ncharred and blackened by the West Saxon fires. The English colonists of\r\nthe neighbourhood called themselves the Wroken-sætas, or Settlers by\r\nthe Wrekin--a word analogous to that of Wilsætas, or Settlers by the\r\nWyly; Dorsætas, or Settlers among the Durotriges; and Sumorsætas, or\r\nSettlers among the Sumor-folk,--which survive in the modern counties of\r\nWilts, Dorset, and Somerset. Similar forms elsewhere are the Pecsætas\r\nof the Derbyshire Peak, the Elmedsætas in the Forest of Elmet, and the\r\nCilternsætas in the Chiltern Hills. No doubt the Wroken-sætas called\r\nthe ruined Roman fort by the analogous name of Wroken ceaster; and this\r\nwould slowly become Wrok ceaster, Wrok-cester, and Wroxeter, by the\r\nordinary abbreviating tendency of the Welsh borderlands. Wrexham\r\ndoubtless preserves the same original root.\r\n\r\nHaving thus carried the _Castra_ to the very confines of Wales, it\r\nwould be unkind to a generous and amiable people not to carry them\r\nacross the border and on to the Western sea. The Welsh corruption,\r\nwhether of the Latin word or of a native equivalent _cathir_, assumes\r\nthe guise of Caer. Thus the old Roman station of Segontium, near the\r\nMenai Straits, is now called Caer Seiont; but the neighbouring modern\r\ntown which has gathered around Edward's new castle on the actual shore,\r\nthe later metropolis of the land of Arfon, became known to Welshmen as\r\nCaer-yn-Arfon, now corrupted into Caernarvon or even into Carnarvon.\r\nGray's familiar line about the murdered bards--'On Arvon's dreary shore\r\nthey lie'--keeps up in some dim fashion the memory of the true\r\netymology. Caermarthen is in like manner the Roman Muridunum or\r\nMoridunum--the fort by the sea--though a duplicate Moridunum in South\r\nDevon has been simply translated into English as Seaton. Innumerable\r\nother Caers, mostly representing Roman sites, may be found scattered up\r\nand down over the face of Wales, such as Caersws, Caerleon, Caergwrle,\r\nCaerhun, and Caerwys, all of which still contain traces of Roman\r\noccupation. On the other hand, Cardigan, which looks delusively like a\r\nshortened Caer, has really nothing to do with this group of ancient\r\nnames, being a mere corruption of Ceredigion.\r\n\r\nBut outside Wales itself, in the more Celtic parts of England proper, a\r\ngood many relics of the old Welsh Caers still bespeak the\r\nincompleteness of the early Teutonic conquest. If we might trust the\r\nmendacious Nennius, indeed, all our Casters and Chesters were once good\r\nCymric Caers; for he gives a doubtful list of the chief towns in\r\nBritain, where Gloucester appears as Cair Gloui, Colchester as Cair\r\nColun, and York as Cair Ebrauc. These, if true, would be invaluable\r\nforms; but unfortunately there is every reason to believe that Nennius\r\ninvented them himself, by a simple transposition of the English names.\r\nHenry of Huntingdon is nearly as bad, if not worse; for when he calls\r\nDorchester 'Kair Dauri,' and Chichester 'Kair Kei,' he was almost\r\ncertainly evolving what he supposed to be appropriate old British names\r\nfrom the depths of his own consciousness. His guesswork was on a par\r\nwith that of the schoolboys who introduce 'Stirlingia' or 'Liverpolia'\r\ninto their Ovidian elegiacs. That abandoned story-teller, Geoffrey of\r\nMonmouth, goes a step further, and concocts a Caer Lud for London and a\r\nCaer Osc for Exeter, whenever the fancy seizes him. The only examples\r\namongst these pretended old Welsh forms which seem to me to have any\r\nreal historical value are an unknown Kair Eden, mentioned by Gildas,\r\nand a Cair Wise, mentioned by Simeon of Durham, undoubtedly the true\r\nnative name of Exeter.\r\n\r\nStill we have a few indubitable Caers in England itself surviving to\r\nour own day. Most of them are not far from the Welsh border, as in the\r\ncase of the two Caer Caradocs, in Shropshire, crowned by ancient\r\nBritish fortifications. Others, however, lie further within the true\r\nEnglish pale, though always in districts which long preserved the Welsh\r\nspeech, at least among the lower classes of the population. The\r\nearthwork overhanging Bath bears to this day its ancient British title\r\nof Caer Badon. An old history written in the monastery of Malmesbury\r\ndescribes that town as Caer Bladon, and speaks of a Caer Dur in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood. There still remains a Caer Riden on the line\r\nof the Roman wall in the Lothians. Near Aspatria, in Cumberland, stands\r\na mouldering Roman camp known even now as Caer Moto. In Carvoran,\r\nNorthumberland, the first syllable has undergone a slight contraction,\r\nbut may still be readily recognised. The Carr-dyke in Norfolk seems to\r\nme to be referable to a similar origin.\r\n\r\nMost curious of all the English Caers, however, is Carlisle. The\r\nAntonine Itinerary gives the town as Luguvallium. Bæda, in his\r\nbarbarised Latin fashion calls it Lugubalia. 'The Saxons,' says\r\n_Murray's Guide_, with charming _naïveté_, 'abbreviated the name into\r\nLuel, and afterwards called it Caer Luel.' This astounding hotchpotch\r\nforms an admirable example of the way in which local etymology is still\r\ngenerally treated in highly respectable publications. So far as we\r\nknow, there never was at any time a single Saxon in Cumberland; and why\r\nthe Saxons, or any other tribe of Englishmen, should have called a town\r\nby a purely Welsh name, it would be difficult to decide. If they had\r\ngiven it any name at all, that name would probably have been Lul\r\nceaster, which might have been modernised into Lulcaster or Lulchester.\r\nThe real facts are these. Cumberland, as its name imports, was long a\r\nland of the Cymry--a northern Welsh principality, dependent upon the\r\ngreat kingdom of Strathclyde, which held out for ages against the\r\nNorthumbrian English invaders among the braes and fells of Ayrshire and\r\nthe Lake District. These Cumbrian Welshmen called their chief town Caer\r\nLuel, or something of the sort; and there is some reason for believing\r\nthat it was the capital of the historical Arthur, if any Arthur ever\r\nexisted, though later ages transferred the legend of the British hero\r\nto Caerleon-upon-Usk, after men had begun to forget that the region\r\nbetween the Clyde and the Mersey had once been true Welsh soil. The\r\nEnglish overran Cumberland very slowly; and when they did finally\r\nconquer it, they probably left the original inhabitants in possession\r\nof the country, and only imposed their own overlordship upon the\r\nconquered race. The story is too long a one to repeat in full here: it\r\nmust suffice to say that, though the Northumbrian kings had made the\r\n'Strathclyde Welsh' their tributaries, the district was never\r\nthoroughly subdued till the days of Edmund the West Saxon, who harried\r\nthe land, and handed it over to the King of Scots. Thus it happens that\r\nCarlisle, alone among large English towns, still keeps unchanged its\r\nCymric name, instead of having sunk into an Anglicised Chester. The\r\npresent spelling is a mere etymological blunder, exactly similar to\r\nthat which has turned the old English word _igland_ into _island_,\r\nthrough the false analogy of _isle_, which of course comes from the old\r\nFrench _isle_, derived through some form akin to the Italian _isola_,\r\nfrom the original Latin _insula_. Kair Leil is the spelling in\r\nGeoffrey; Cardeol (by a clerical error for Carleol, I suspect) that in\r\nthe _English Chronicle_, which only once mentions the town; and Carleol\r\nthat of the ordinary mediæval historians. The surnames Carlyle and\r\nCarlile still preserve the better orthography.\r\n\r\nTo complete the subject, it will be well to say a few words about those\r\ntowns which were once _Ceasters_, but which have never become Casters\r\nor Chesters. Numerous as are the places now so called, a number more\r\nmay be reckoned in the illimitable chapter of the might-have-beens; and\r\nit is interesting to speculate on the forms which they would have\r\ntaken, 'si qua fata aspera rupissent.' Among these still-born Chesters,\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne may fairly rank first. It stands on the Roman site,\r\ncalled, from its bridge across the Tyne, Pons Aelii, and known later\r\non, from its position on the great wall, as Ad Murum. Under the early\r\nEnglish, after their conversion to Christianity, the monks became the\r\naccepted inheritors of Roman ruins; and the small monastery which was\r\nestablished here procured it the English name of Muneca-ceaster, or, as\r\nwe should now say, Monk-chester, though no doubt the local\r\nmodernisation would have taken the form of Muncaster. William of\r\nNormandy utterly destroyed the town during his great harrying of\r\nNorthumberland; and when his son, Robert Curthose, built a fortress on\r\nthe site, the place came to be called Newcastle--a word whose very form\r\nshows its comparatively modern origin. _Castra_ and _Ceasters_ were now\r\nout of date, and castles had taken their place. Still, we stick even\r\nhere to the old root: for of course castle is only the diminutive\r\n_castellum_--a scion of the same Roman stock, which, like so many other\r\nmembers of aristocratic families, 'came over with William the\r\nConqueror.' The word _castel_ is never used, I believe, in any English\r\ndocument before the Conquest; but in the very year of William's\r\ninvasion, the _Chronicle_ tells us, 'Willelm earl came from Normandy\r\ninto Pevensey, and wrought a castel at Hastings port.' So, while in\r\nFrance itself the word has declined through _chastel_ into _château_,\r\nwe in England have kept it in comparative purity as castle.\r\n\r\nYork is another town which had a narrow escape of becoming Yorchester.\r\nIts Roman name was Eburacum, which the English queerly rendered as\r\nEoforwic, by a very interesting piece of folks-etymology. _Eofor_ is\r\nold English for a boar, and _wic_ for a town; so our rude ancestors\r\nmetamorphosed the Latinised Celtic name into this familiar and\r\nsignificant form, much as our own sailors turn the Bellerophon into the\r\nBilly Ruffun, and the Anse des Cousins into the Nancy Cozens. In the\r\nsame way, I have known an illiterate Englishman speak of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle as Hexley Chapel. To the name, thus distorted, our\r\nforefathers of course added the generic word for a Roman town, and so\r\nmade the cumbrous title of Eoforwic-ceaster, which is the almost\r\nuniversal form in the earlier parts of the _English Chronicle_. This\r\nwas too much of a mouthful even for the hardy Anglo-Saxon, so we soon\r\nfind a disposition to shorten it into Ceaster on the one hand, or\r\nEoforwic on the other. Should the final name be Chester or York?--that\r\nwas the question. Usage declared in favour of the more distinctive\r\ntitle. The town became Eoforwic alone, and thence gradually declined\r\nthrough Evorwic, Euorwic, Eurewic, and Yorick into the modern York. It\r\nis curious to note that some of these intermediate forms very closely\r\napproach the original Eburac, which must have been the root of the\r\nRoman name. Was the change partly due to the preservation of the older\r\nsound on the lips of Celtic serfs? It is not impossible, for marks of\r\nBritish blood are strong in Yorkshire; and Nennius confirms the idea by\r\ncalling the town Kair Ebrauc.\r\n\r\nAmong the other _Ceasters_ which have never developed into full-blown\r\nChesters, I may mention Bath, given as Akemannes ceaster and Bathan\r\nceaster in our old documents, so that it might have become\r\nAchemanchester or Bathceter in the course of ordinary changes.\r\nCanterbury, again, the Roman Durovernum, dropped through Dorobernia\r\ninto Dorwit ceaster, which would no doubt have turned into a third\r\nDorchester, to puzzle our heads by its likeness to Dorne ceaster in\r\nDorsetshire, and to Dorce ceaster near Oxford; while Chesterton in\r\nHuntingdonshire, which was once Dorme ceaster, narrowly escaped\r\nburdening a distracted world with a fourth. Happily, the colloquial\r\nform Cantwara burh, or Kentmen's bury, gained the day, and so every\r\ntrace of Durovernum is now quite lost in Canterbury. North Shields was\r\nonce Scythles-ceaster, but here the Chester has simply dropped out.\r\nVerulam, or St. Albans, is another curious case. Its Romano-British\r\nname was Verulamium, and Bæda calls it Verlama ceaster. But the early\r\nEnglish in Sleswick believed in a race of mythical giants, the\r\nWætlingas or Watlings, from whom they called the Milky Way 'Watling\r\nStreet.' When the rude pirates from those trackless marshes came over\r\nto Britain and first beheld the great Roman paved causeway which ran\r\nacross the face of the country from London to Caernarvon, they seemed\r\nto have imagined that such a mighty work could not have been the\r\nhandicraft of men; and just as the Arabs ascribe the rock-hewn houses\r\nof Petra to the architectural fancy of the Devil, so our old English\r\nancestors ascribed the Roman road to the Titanic Watlings. Even in our\r\nown day, it is known along its whole course as Watling Street. Verulam\r\nstands right in its track, and long contained some of the greatest\r\nRoman remains in England; so the town, too, came to be considered as\r\nanother example of the work of the Watlings. Bæda, in his Latinised\r\nNorthumbrian, calls it Vætlinga ceaster, as an alternative title with\r\nVerlama ceaster; so that it might nowadays have been familiar to us all\r\neither as Watlingchester or Verlamchester. This is one of the numerous\r\ncases where a Roman and English name lived on during the dark period\r\nside by side. In some of Mr. Kemble's charters it appears as Walinga\r\nceaster. But when Offa of Mercia founded his great abbey on the very\r\nspot where the Welsh martyr Alban had suffered during the persecution\r\nof Diocletian, Roman and English names were alike forgotten, and the\r\nplace was remembered only after the British Christian as St. Albans.\r\n\r\nThere are other instances where the very memory of a Roman city seems\r\nnow to have failed altogether. For example, Bæda mentions a certain\r\ntown called Tiowulfinga ceaster--that is to say, the Chester of the\r\nTiowulfings, or sons of Tiowulf. Here an English clan would seem to\r\nhave taken up its abode in a ruined Roman station, and to have called\r\nthe place by the clan-name--a rare or almost unparalleled case. But its\r\nprecise site is now unknown. However, Bæda's description clearly points\r\nto some town in Nottinghamshire, situated on the Trent; for St.\r\nPaulinus of York baptized large numbers of converts in that river at\r\nTiowulfinga ceaster; and the site may therefore be confidently\r\nidentified with Southwell, where St. Mary's Minster has always\r\ntraditionally claimed Paulinus as its founder. Bæda also mentions a\r\nplace called Tunna ceaster, so named from an abbot Tunna, who exists\r\nmerely for the sake of a legend, and is clearly as unhistorical as his\r\npiratical compeer Hrof--a wild guess of the eponymic sort with which we\r\nare all so familiar in Greek literature. Simeon of Durham speaks of an\r\nequally unknown Delvercester. Syddena ceaster or Sidna cester--the\r\nearliest see of the Lincolnshire diocese--has likewise dropped out of\r\nhuman memory; though Mr. Pearson suggests that it may be identical with\r\nAncaster--a notion which appears to me extremely unlikely. Wude cester\r\nis no doubt Outchester, and other doubtful instances might easily be\r\nrecognised by local antiquaries, though they may readily escape the\r\ngeneral archæologist. In one case at least--that of Othonæ in\r\nEssex--town, site, and name have all disappeared together. Bæda calls\r\nit Ythan ceaster, and in his time it was the seat of a monastery\r\nfounded by St. Cedd; but the whole place has long since been swept away\r\nby an inundation of the Blackwater. Anderida, which is called\r\nAndredes-ceaster in the _Chronicle_, becomes Pefenesea, or Pevensey,\r\nbefore the date of the Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the list given here is by any means\r\nexhaustive of all the Casters and Chesters, past and present,\r\nthroughout the whole length and breadth of Britain. On the contrary,\r\nmany more might easily be added, such as Ribbel ceaster, now\r\nRibchester; Berne ceaster, now Bicester; and Blædbyrig ceaster, now\r\nsimply Bladbury. In Northumberland alone there are a large number of\r\ninstances which I might have quoted, such as Rutchester, Halton\r\nChesters, and Little Chesters on the Roman Wall, together with\r\nHetchester, Holy Chesters, and Rochester elsewhere--the county\r\ncontaining no less than four places of the last name. Indeed, one can\r\ntrack the Roman roads across England by the Chesters which accompany\r\ntheir route. But enough instances have probably been adduced to\r\nexemplify fully the general principles at issue. I think it will be\r\nclear that the English conquerors did not usually change the names of\r\nRoman or Welsh towns, but simply mispronounced them about as much as we\r\nhabitually mispronounce Llangollen or Llandudno. Sometimes they called\r\nthe place by its Romanised title alone, with the addition of Ceaster;\r\nsometimes they employed the servile British form; sometimes they even\r\ninvented an English alternative; but in no case can it be shown that\r\nthey at once disused the original name, and introduced a totally new\r\none of their own manufacture. In this, as in all other matters, the\r\ncontinuity between Romano-British and English times is far greater than\r\nit is generally represented to be. The English invasion was a cruel and\r\na desolating one, no doubt; but it could not and it did not sweep away\r\nwholly the old order of things, or blot out all the past annals of\r\nBritain, so as to prepare a _tabula rasa_ on which Mr. Green might\r\nbegin his _History of the English People_ with the landing of Hengest\r\nand Horsa in the Isle of Thanet. The English people of to-day is far\r\nmore deeply rooted in the soil than that: our ancestors have lived\r\nhere, not for a thousand years alone, but for ten thousand or a hundred\r\nthousand, in certain lines at least. And the very names of our towns,\r\nour rivers, and our hills, go back in many cases, not merely to the\r\nRoman corruptions, but to the aboriginal Celtic, and the still more\r\naboriginal Euskarian tongue.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENDERSON & SPALDING, LTD., 3 & 5, MARYLEBONE LANE, W.",
