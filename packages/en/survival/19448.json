The Deacon, the Doctor, the Squire, Charlie and\r\nmyself all felt flattered and somewhat bashful at finding ourselves in\r\nsuch distinguished company. I need not say that this new Chapter from\r\nthe pen of the most eminent English agricultural investigator is worthy\r\nof a very careful study. I have read it again and again, and each time\r\nwith great and renewed interest. I could wish there was more of it. But\r\nto the intelligent and well-informed reader this Chapter will be valued\r\nnot merely for what it contains, but for what it omits. A man who knew\r\nless would write more. Sir John goes straight to the mark, and we have\r\nhere his mature views on one of the most important questions in\r\nagricultural science and practice.\r\n\r\nSir John describes a tract of poor land, and tells us that the cheapest\r\nmethod of improving and enriching it is, to keep a large breeding flock\r\nof sheep, and feed them American cotton-seed cake. We are pleased to\r\nfind that this is in accordance with the general teaching of our\r\n“Talks,” as given in this book several years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen this work was first published, some of my friends expressed\r\nsurprise that I did not recommend the more extended use of artificial\r\nmanures. One thing is certain, since that time the use of superphosphate\r\nhas been greatly on the increase. And it seems clear that its use must\r\nbe profitable. Where I live, in Western New York, it is sown quite\r\ngenerally on winter wheat, and also on barley and oats in the spring.\r\nOn corn and potatoes, its use is not so common. Whether this is because\r\nits application to these crops is not so easy, or because it does not\r\nproduce so marked an increase in the yield per acre, I am unable to say.\r\n\r\nOur winter wheat is sown here the first, second, or (rarely) the third\r\nweek in September. We sow from one and a half to two and a quarter\r\nbushels per acre. It is almost invariably sown with a drill. The drill\r\nhas a fertilizer attachment that distributes the superphosphate at the\r\nsame time the wheat is sown. The superphosphate is not mixed with the\r\nwheat, but it drops into the same tubes with the wheat, and is sown with\r\nit in the same drill mark. In this way, the superphosphate is deposited\r\nwhere the roots of the young plants can immediately find it. For barley\r\nand oats the same method is adopted.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the cost of sowing superphosphate on these crops\r\nis merely nominal. But for corn and potatoes, when planted in hills,\r\nthe superphosphate must be dropped in the hill by hand, and, as we are\r\nalmost always hurried at that season of the year, we are impatient at\r\nanything which will delay planting even for a day. The boys want to go\r\nfishing!\r\n\r\nThis is, undoubtedly, one reason why superphosphate is not used so\r\ngenerally with us for corn as for wheat, barley, and oats. Another\r\nreason may be, that one hundred pounds of corn will not sell for\r\nanything like as much as one hundred pounds of wheat, barley, and oats.\r\n\r\nWe are now buying a very good superphosphate, made from Carolina rock\r\nphosphate, for about one and a half cents per pound. We usually drill in\r\nabout two hundred pounds per acre at a cost of three dollars. Now, if\r\nthis gives us an increase of five bushels of wheat per acre, worth six\r\ndollars, we think it pays. It often does far better than this. Last year\r\nthe wheat crop of Western New York was the best in a third of a century,\r\nwhich is as far back as I have had anything to do with farming here.\r\nFrom all I can learn, it is doubtful if the wheat crop of Western New\r\nYork has ever averaged a larger yield per acre since the land was first\r\ncultivated after the removal of the original forest. Something of this\r\nis due to better methods of cultivation and tillage, and something,\r\ndoubtless, to the general use of superphosphate, but much more to the\r\nfavorable season.\r\n\r\nThe present year our wheat crop turned out exceedingly poor. Hundreds of\r\nacres of wheat were plowed up, and the land resown, and hundreds more\r\nwould have been plowed up had it not been for the fact that the land\r\nwas seeded with timothy grass at the time of sowing the wheat, and with\r\nclover in the spring. We do not like to lose our grass and clover.\r\n\r\nDry weather in the autumn was the real cause of the poor yield of wheat\r\nthis year. True, we had a very trying winter, and a still more trying\r\nspring, followed by dry, cold weather. The season was very backward. We\r\nwere not able to sow anything in the fields before the first of May, and\r\nour wheat ought to have been ready to harvest in July. On the first of\r\nMay, many of our wheat-fields, especially on clay land, looked as bare\r\nas a naked fallow.\r\n\r\nThere was here and there, a good field of wheat. As a rule, it was on\r\nnaturally moist land, or after a good summer-fallow, sown early. I know\r\nof but one exception. A neighboring nursery firm had a very promising\r\nfield of wheat, which was sown late. But their land is rich and\r\nunusually well worked. It is, in fact, in the very highest condition,\r\nand, though sown late, the young plants were enabled to make a good\r\nstrong growth in the autumn.\r\n\r\nIn such a dry season, the great point is, to get the seed to germinate,\r\nand to furnish sufficient moisture and food to enable the young plants\r\nto make a strong, vigorous growth of roots in the autumn. I do not say\r\nthat two hundred pounds of superphosphate per acre, drilled in with the\r\nseed, will always accomplish this object. But it is undoubtedly a great\r\nhelp. It does not furnish the nitrogen which the wheat requires, but\r\nif it will stimulate the production of roots in the early autumn, the\r\nplants will be much more likely to find a sufficient supply of nitrogen\r\nin the soil than plants with fewer and smaller roots.\r\n\r\nIn a season like the past, therefore, an application of two hundred\r\npounds of superphosphate per acre, costing three dollars, instead of\r\ngiving an increase of five or six bushels per acre, may give us an\r\nincrease of fifteen or twenty bushels per acre. That is to say, owing\r\nto the dry weather in the autumn, followed by severe weather in the\r\nwinter, the weak plants on the unmanured land may either be killed out\r\naltogether, or injured to such an extent that the crop is hardly worth\r\nharvesting, while the wheat where the phosphate was sown may give us\r\nalmost an average crop.\r\n\r\nSir John B. Lawes has somewhere compared the owner of land to the owner\r\nof a coal mine. The owner of the coal digs it and gets it to market in\r\nthe best way he can. The farmer’s coal mine consists of plant food, and\r\nthe object of the farmer is to get this food into such plants, or such\r\nparts of plants, as his customers require. It is hardly worth while for\r\nthe owner of the coal mine to trouble his head about the exhaustion of\r\nthe supply of coal. His true plan is to dig it as economically as he\r\ncan, and get it into market. There is a good deal of coal in the world,\r\nand there is a good deal of plant food in the earth. As long as the\r\nplant food lies dormant in the soil, it is of no value to man. The\r\nobject of the farmer is to convert it into products which man and\r\nanimals require.\r\n\r\nMining for coal is a very simple matter, but how best to get the\r\ngreatest quantity of plant food out of the soil, with the least waste\r\nand the greatest profit, is a much more complex and difficult task.\r\nPlant food consists of a dozen or more different substances. We have\r\ntalked about them in the pages of this book, and all I wish to say here\r\nis that some of them are much more abundant, and more readily obtained,\r\nthan others. The three substances most difficult to get at are: nitric\r\nacid, phosphoric acid and potash. All these substances are in the soil,\r\nbut some soils contain much more than others, and their relative\r\nproportion varies considerably. The substance which is of the greatest\r\nimportance, is nitric acid. As a rule, the fertility of a soil is in\r\nproportion to the amount of nitric acid which becomes available for the\r\nuse of plants during the growing season. Many of our soils contain large\r\nquantities of nitrogen, united with carbon, but the plants do not take\r\nit up in this form. It has to be converted into nitric acid. Nitric acid\r\nconsists of seven pounds of nitrogen and twenty pounds of oxygen. It is\r\nproduced by the combustion of nitrogen. Since these “Talks” were\r\npublished, several important facts have been discovered in regard to how\r\nplants take up nitrogen, and especially in regard to how organic\r\nnitrogen is converted into nitric acid. It is brought about through the\r\naction of a minute fungoid plant. There are several things necessary for\r\nthe growth of this plant. We must have some nitrogenous substance,\r\na moderate degree of heat, say from seventy to one hundred and twenty\r\ndegrees, a moderate amount of moisture, and plenty of oxygen. Shade is\r\nalso favorable. If too hot or too cold, or too wet or too dry, the\r\ngrowth of the plant is checked, and the formation of nitric acid\r\nsuspended. The presence of lime, or of some alkali, is also necessary\r\nfor the growth of this fungus and the production of nitric acid. The\r\nnitric acid unites with the lime, and forms nitrate of lime, or with\r\nsoda to form nitrate of soda, or with potash to form nitrate of potash,\r\nor salt-petre. A water-logged soil, by excluding the oxygen, destroys\r\nthis plant, hence one of the advantages of underdraining. I have said\r\nthat shade is favorable to the growth of this fungus, and this fact\r\nexplains and confirms the common idea that shade is manure.\r\n\r\nThe great object of agriculture is to convert the nitrogen of our soils,\r\nor of green crops plowed under, or of manure, into nitric acid, and then\r\nto convert this nitric acid into profitable products with as little loss\r\nas possible. Nitrogen, or rather nitric acid, is the most costly\r\ningredient in plant food, and unfortunately it is very easily washed out\r\nof the soil and lost. Perhaps it is absolutely impossible to entirely\r\nprevent all loss from leaching; but it is certainly well worth our while\r\nto understand the subject, and to know exactly what we are doing. In a\r\nnew country, where land is cheap, it may be more profitable to raise as\r\nlarge crops as possible without any regard to the loss of nitric acid.\r\nBut this condition of things does not last long, and it very soon\r\nbecomes desirable to adopt less wasteful processes.\r\n\r\nIn Lawes and Gilbert’s experiments, there is a great loss of nitric\r\nacid from drainage. In no case has as much nitrogen been obtained in the\r\nincreased crop as was applied in the manure. There is always a loss and\r\nprobably always will be. But we should do all we can to make this loss\r\nas small as possible, consistent with the production of profitable\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of lessening this loss of nitric acid. Our farmers\r\nsow superphosphate with their wheat in the autumn, and this stimulates,\r\nwe think, the growth of roots, which ramify in all directions through\r\nthe soil. This increased growth of root brings the plant in contact with\r\na larger feeding surface, and enables it to take up more nitric acid\r\nfrom its solution in the soil. Such is also the case during the winter\r\nand early spring, when a good deal of water permeates through the\r\nsoil. The application of superphosphate, unquestionably in many cases,\r\nprevents much loss of nitric acid. It does this by giving us a much\r\ngreater growth of wheat.\r\n\r\nI was at Rothamsted in 1879, and witnessed the injurious effect of an\r\nexcessive rainfall, in washing out of the soil nitrate of soda and salts\r\nof ammonia, which were sown with the wheat in the autumn. It was an\r\nexceedingly wet season, and the loss of nitrates on all the different\r\nplots was very great. But where the nitrates or salts of ammonia were\r\nsown in the spring, while the crops were growing, the loss was not\r\nnearly so great as when sown in the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe sight of that wheat field impressed me, as nothing else could, with\r\nthe importance of guarding against the loss of available nitrogen from\r\nleaching, and it has changed my practice in two or three important\r\nrespects. I realize, as never before, the importance of applying manure\r\nto crops, rather than to the land. I mean by this, that the object of\r\napplying manure is, not simply to make land rich, but to make crops\r\ngrow. Manure is a costly and valuable article, and we want to convert it\r\ninto plants, with as little delay as possible, which will, directly or\r\nindirectly, bring in some money.\r\n\r\nOur climate is very different from that of England. As a rule, we seldom\r\nhave enough rain, from the time corn is planted until it is harvested,\r\nto more than saturate the ground on our upland soils. This year is an\r\nexception. On Sunday night, May 20, 1883, we had a northeast storm which\r\ncontinued three days. During these three days, from three to five inches\r\nof rain fell, and for the first time in many years, at this season, my\r\nunderdrains discharged water to their full capacity. Had nitrate of\r\nsoda been sown on bare land previous to this rain, much of it would,\r\ndoubtless, have been lost by leaching. This, however, is an exceptional\r\ncase. My underdrains usually do not commence to discharge water before\r\nthe first of December, or continue later than the first of May. To guard\r\nagainst loss of nitrogen by leaching, therefore, we should aim to keep\r\nrich land occupied by some crop, during the winter and early spring, and\r\nthe earlier the crop is sown in the autumn or late summer, the better,\r\nso that the roots will the more completely fill the ground and take up\r\nall the available nitrogen within their reach. I have said that this\r\nidea had modified my own practice. I grow a considerable quantity of\r\ngarden vegetables, principally for seed. It is necessary to make the\r\nland very rich. The plan I have adopted to guard against the loss of\r\nnitrogen is this: As soon as the land is cleared of any crop, after it\r\nis too late to sow turnips, I sow it with rye at the rate of one and a\r\nhalf to two bushels per acre. On this rich land, especially on the moist\r\nlow land, the rye makes a great growth during our warm autumn weather.\r\nThe rye checks the growth of weeds, and furnishes a considerable amount\r\nof succulent food for sheep, during the autumn or in the spring. If not\r\nneeded for food, it can be turned under in the spring for manure. It\r\nunquestionably prevents the loss of considerable nitric acid from\r\nleaching during the winter and early spring.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat, or millet, is sometimes sown on such land for plowing under\r\nas manure, but as these crops are killed out by the winter, they cannot\r\nprevent the loss of nitric acid during the winter and spring months. It\r\nis only on unusually rich land that such precautions are particularly\r\nnecessary. It has been thought that these experiments of Lawes and\r\nGilbert afford a strong argument against the use of summer-fallows. I do\r\nnot think so. A summer-fallow, in this country, is usually a piece of\r\nland which has been seeded down one, two, and sometimes three years,\r\nwith red clover. The land is plowed in May or June, and occasionally in\r\nJuly, and is afterwards sown to winter wheat in September. The treatment\r\nof the summer-fallow varies in different localities and on different\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nSometimes the land is only plowed once. The clover, or sod, is plowed\r\nunder deep and well, and the after-treatment consists in keeping the\r\nsurface soil free from weeds, by the frequent use of the harrow, roller,\r\ncultivator or gang-plow. In other cases, especially on heavy clay land,\r\nthe first plowing is done early in the spring, and when the sod is\r\nsufficiently rotted, the land is cross-plowed, and afterwards made fine\r\nand mellow by the use of the roller, harrow, and cultivator. Just before\r\nsowing the wheat, many good, old-fashioned farmers, plow the land again.\r\nBut in this section, a summer-fallow, plowed two or three times during\r\nthe summer, is becoming more and more rare every year.\r\n\r\nThose farmers who summer-fallow at all, as a rule, plow their land but\r\nonce, and content themselves with mere surface cultivation afterwards.\r\nIt is undoubtedly true, also, that summer fallows of all kinds are by\r\nno means as common as formerly. This fact may be considered an argument\r\nagainst the use of summer-fallowing; but it is not conclusive in my\r\nmind. Patient waiting is not a characteristic of the age. We are\r\ninclined to take risks. We prefer to sow our land to oats, or barley,\r\nand run the chance of getting a good wheat crop after it, rather than to\r\nspend several months in cleaning and mellowing the land, simply to grow\r\none crop of wheat.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to me entirely unnecessary to urge farmers not to\r\nsummer-fallow. We all naturally prefer to see the land occupied by a\r\ngood paying crop, rather than to spend time, money, and labor, in\r\npreparing it to produce a crop twelve or fifteen months afterwards. Yet\r\nsome of the agricultural editors and many of the agricultural writers,\r\nseem to take delight in deriding the old-fashioned summer-fallow. The\r\nfact that Lawes and Gilbert in England find that, when land contains\r\nconsiderable nitric acid, the water which percolates through the soil\r\nto the underdrains beneath, contains more nitrate of lime when the land\r\nis not occupied by a crop, than when the roots of growing plants fill\r\nthe soil, is deemed positive proof that summer-fallowing is a wasteful\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nIf we summer-fallowed for a spring crop, as I have sometimes done, it\r\nis quite probable that there would be a loss of nitrogen. But, as I have\r\nsaid before, it is very seldom that any water passes through the soil\r\nfrom the time we commence the summer-fallow until the wheat is sown in\r\nthe autumn, or for many weeks afterwards. The nitrogen, which is\r\nconverted into nitric acid by the agency of a good summer-fallow, is\r\nno more liable to be washed out of the soil after the field is sown to\r\nwheat in the autumn, than if we applied the nitrogen in the form of some\r\nreadily available manure.\r\n\r\nI still believe in summer fallows. If I had my life to live over again,\r\nI would certainly summer-fallow more than I have done. I have been an\r\nagricultural writer for one-third of a century, and have persistently\r\nadvocated the more extended use of the summer-fallow. I have nothing\r\nto take back, unless it is what I have said in reference to\r\n“fall-fallowing.” Possibly this practice may result in loss, though\r\nI do not think so.\r\n\r\nA good summer-fallow, on rather heavy clay land, if the conditions are\r\notherwise favorable, is pretty sure to give us a good crop of wheat, and\r\na good crop of clover and grass afterwards. Of course, a farmer who has\r\nnice, clean sandy soil, will not think of summer-fallowing it. Such\r\nsoils are easily worked, and it is not a difficult matter to keep them\r\nclean without summer-fallowing. Such soils, however, seldom contain a\r\nlarge store of unavailable plant food, and instead of summer-fallowing,\r\nwe had better manure. On such soils artificial manures are often very\r\nprofitable, though barn-yard manure, or the droppings of animals feeding\r\non the land, should be the prime basis of all attempts to maintain, or\r\nincrease, the productiveness of such soils.\r\n\r\nSince this book was first published, I do not know of any new facts\r\nin regard to the important question of, how best to manage and apply\r\nour barn-yard manure, so as to make it more immediately active and\r\navailable. It is unquestionably true, that the same amount of nitrogen\r\nin barn-yard manure, will not produce so great an effect as its\r\ntheoretical value would indicate. There can be no doubt, however, that\r\nthe better we feed our animals, and the more carefully we save the\r\nliquids, the more valuable and active will be the manure.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of the inert nitrogen of manures and soils, into nitric\r\nacid, as already stated, is now known to be produced by a minute fungus.\r\nI hope it will be found that we can introduce this _bacterium_ into our\r\nmanure piles, in such a way as to greatly aid the conversion of inert\r\nnitrogen into nitrates.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made, and are still continued, at Woburn, under\r\nthe auspices of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, to ascertain,\r\namong other things, whether manure from sheep receiving an allowance of\r\ncotton-seed cake is any richer than that from sheep, otherwise fed\r\nalike, but having, instead of cotton-seed cake, the same amount of corn\r\nmeal. We know that such manure contains more nitrogen, and other plant\r\nfood, than that from the corn meal. But the experiments so far, though\r\nthey have been continued for several years, do not show any striking\r\nsuperiority of the manure from cotton-seed cake over that from corn\r\nmeal. I saw the wheat on these differently manured plots in 1879. Dr.\r\nVœlcker and Dr. Gilbert, told me that, one of two plots was dressed with\r\nthe cotton-seed manure, and the other with the corn meal manure, and\r\nthey wanted me to say which was the most promising crop. I believe the\r\none I said was the better, was the cotton-seed plot. But the difference\r\nwas very slight. The truth is that such experiments must be continued\r\nfor many years before they will prove anything. As I said before, we\r\nknow that the manure from the cotton-seed cake is richer in nitrogen\r\nthan that from the corn meal; but we also know that this nitrogen will\r\nnot produce so great an effect, as a much smaller amount of nitrogen in\r\nsalts of ammonia, or nitrate of soda.\r\n\r\nIn going over these experiments, I was struck with the healthy and\r\nvigorous appearance of one of the plots of wheat, and asked how it was\r\nmanured. Dr. Vœlcker called out, “clover, Mr. Harris, clover.” In\r\nEngland, as in America, it requires very little observation and\r\nexperience to convince any one of the value of clover. After what I\r\nhave said, and what the Deacon, the Doctor, Charley and the Squire have\r\nsaid, in the pages of this book, I hope no one will think that I do not\r\nappreciate the great value of red clover as a means of enriching our\r\nland. Dr. Vœlcker evidently thought I was skeptical on this point. I am\r\nnot. I have great faith in the benefits to be derived from the growth\r\nof clover. But I do not think it originates fertility; it does not get\r\nnitrogen from the atmosphere. Or at any rate, we have no evidence of it.\r\nThe facts are all the other way. We have discussed this question at\r\nconsiderable length in the pages of this book, and it is not necessary\r\nto say more on the subject. I would, however, particularly urge farmers,\r\nespecially those who are using phosphates freely, to grow as much clover\r\nas possible, and feed it out on the farm, or plow it under for manure.\r\n\r\nThe question is frequently asked, whether the use of phosphates will\r\nultimately impoverish our farms. It may, or it may not. It depends on\r\nour general management. Theoretically, the use of a manure furnishing\r\nonly one element of plant food, if it increases the growth of crops\r\nwhich are sold from the farm, must have a tendency to impoverish the\r\nland of the other elements of plant food. In other words, the use of\r\nsuperphosphate furnishing only, or principally, phosphoric acid, lime\r\nand sulphuric acid, must have a tendency to impoverish the soil of\r\nnitrogen and potash. Practically, however, it need do nothing of the\r\nkind. If the land is well cultivated, and if our low, rich, alluvial\r\nportions of the farm are drained, and if the hay, grass, clover, straw\r\nand fodder crops are retained, the more phosphates we use, the richer\r\nand more productive will the farm become. And I think it is a fact, that\r\nthe farmers who use the most phosphates, are the very men who take the\r\ngreatest pains to drain their land, cultivate it thoroughly, and make\r\nthe most manure. It follows, therefore, that the use of phosphates is a\r\nnational benefit.\r\n\r\nSome of our railroad managers take this view of the subject. They\r\ncarry superphosphate at a low rate, knowing that its use will increase\r\nthe freight the other way. In other words, they bring a ton of\r\nsuperphosphate from the seaboard, knowing that its use will give them\r\nmany tons of freight of produce, from the interior to the seaboard. It\r\nis not an uncommon thing for two hundred pounds of superphosphate, to\r\ngive an increase of five tons of turnips per acre. Or, so to speak, the\r\nrailroad that brings one ton of superphosphate from the seaboard, might,\r\nas the result of its use, have fifty tons of freight to carry back\r\nagain. This is perhaps an exceptionably favorable instance, but it\r\nillustrates the principle. Years ago, before the abolition of tolls on\r\nthe English turnpike roads, carriages loaded with lime, and all other\r\nsubstances intended for manure, were allowed to go free. And our\r\nrailroads will find it to their interest to transport manures of all\r\nkinds, at a merely nominal rate.\r\n\r\nMany people will be surprised at the recommendation of Sir John B.\r\nLawes, not to waste time and money in cleaning poor land, before seeding\r\nit down to grass. He thinks that if the land is made rich, the superior\r\ngrasses overgrow the bad grasses and weeds. I have no doubt he is right\r\nin this, though the principle may be pushed to an extreme. Our climate,\r\nin this country, is so favorable for killing weeds, that the plow and\r\nthe cultivator will probably be a more economical means of making our\r\nland clean, than the liberal use of expensive manures. It depends,\r\ndoubtless, on the land and on circumstances. It is well to know that\r\nmanure on grass land, will so increase the growth of the good grasses,\r\nas to smother the weeds. Near my house was a piece of land that I wanted\r\nto make into a lawn. I sowed it with grass seed, but the weeds smothered\r\nit out. I plowed it, and hoed it, and re-seeded it, but still the weeds\r\ngrew. Mallows came up by the thousand, with other weeds too numerous to\r\nmention. It was an eye-sore. We mowed the weeds, but almost despaired of\r\never making a decent bit of grass land out of it. It so happened that,\r\none year, we placed the chicken coops on this miserable weedy spot. The\r\nhens and chickens were kept there for several weeks. The feed and the\r\ndroppings made it look more unsightly than ever, but the next spring,\r\nas if by magic, the weeds were gone and the land was covered with dark\r\ngreen luxuriant grass.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the use of potash as a manure, we have still much to learn.\r\nIt would seem that our grain crops will use soda, if they cannot get\r\npotash. They much prefer the potash, and will grow much more luxuriantly\r\nwhere, in the soil or manure, in addition to the other elements of plant\r\nfood, potash is abundant. But the increased growth caused by the potash,\r\nis principally, if not entirely, straw, or leaves and stem. Nature makes\r\na great effort to propagate the species. A plant of wheat or barley,\r\nwill produce seed if this is possible, even at the expense of the other\r\nparts of the plant.\r\n\r\nFor grain crops, grown for seed, therefore, it would seem to be entirely\r\nunprofitable to use potash as a manure. If the soil contains the other\r\nelements of plant food, the addition of potash may give us a much more\r\nluxuriant growth of leaves and stem, but no more grain or seed. For hay,\r\nor grass or fodder crops, the case is very different, and potash may\r\noften be used on these crops to great advantage.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that considerable nitrate of soda will yet be\r\nused in this country for manure. I do not suppose it will pay as a rule,\r\non wheat, corn and other standard grain crops. But the gardener, seed\r\ngrower, and nurseryman, will find out how to use it with great profit.\r\nOur nurserymen say that they cannot use artificial manures with any\r\nadvantage. It is undoubtedly true that a dressing of superphosphate,\r\nsown on a block of nursery trees, will do little good. It never reaches\r\nthe roots of the plants. Superphosphate can not be washed down deep into\r\nthe soil. Nitrate of soda is readily carried down, as deep as the water\r\nsinks. For trees, therefore, it would seem desirable to apply the\r\nsuperphosphate before they are planted, and plow it under. And the same\r\nis true of potash; but nitrate of soda would be better applied as a\r\ntop-dressing every year, early in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe most discouraging fact, in Lawes’ and Gilbert’s experiments, is the\r\ngreat loss of nitrogen. It would seem that, on an average, during the\r\nlast forty years, about one-half the nitrogen is washed out of the soil,\r\nor otherwise lost. I can not but hope and believe that, at any rate in\r\nthis country, there is no such loss in practical agriculture. In Lawes’\r\nand Gilbert’s experiments on wheat, this grain is grown year after year,\r\non the same land. Forty annual crops have been removed. No clover is\r\nsown with the wheat, and great pains are taken to keep the land clean.\r\nThe crop is hoed while growing, and the weeds are pulled out by hand.\r\nThe best wheat season during the forty years, was the year 1863. The\r\npoorest, that of 1879; and it so happened, that after an absence of\r\nthirty years, I was at Rothamsted during this poor year of 1879. The\r\nfirst thing that struck me, in looking at the experimental wheat, was\r\nthe ragged appearance of the crop. My own wheat crop was being cut the\r\nday I left home, July 15. Several men and boys were pulling weeds out\r\nof the experimental wheat, two weeks later. Had the weeds been suffered\r\nto grow, Sir John Bennet Lawes tells us, there would be less loss of\r\nnitrogen. The loss of nitrogen in 1863, was about twenty-four pounds\r\nper acre, and in 1879 fifty pounds per acre--the amount of available\r\nnitrogen, applied in each year, being eighty-seven pounds per acre. As I\r\nsaid before, the wheat in 1879 had to me a ragged look. It was thin on\r\nthe ground. There were not plants enough to take up and evaporate the\r\nlarge amount of water which fell during the wet season. Such a condition\r\nof things rarely occurs in this country. We sow timothy with our winter\r\nwheat, in the autumn, and red clover in the spring. After the wheat is\r\nharvested, we frequently have a heavy growth of clover in the autumn. In\r\nsuch circumstances I believe there would be comparatively little loss of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nIn the summer-fallow experiments, which have now been continued for\r\ntwenty-seven years, there has been a great loss of nitrogen. The same\r\nremarks apply to this case. No one ever advocates summer-fallowing land\r\nevery other year, and sowing nothing but wheat. When we summer-fallow a\r\npiece of land for wheat, we seed it down with grass and clover. There\r\nis, as a rule, very little loss of nitrogen by drainage while the wheat\r\nis growing on the ground, but after the wheat is cut, the grass and\r\nclover are pretty sure to take up all the available nitrogen within\r\nthe range of their roots. This summer-fallow experiment, instead of\r\naffording an argument against the use of summer-fallowing, is an\r\nargument in its favor. The summer-fallow, by exposing the soil to the\r\ndecomposing influences of the atmosphere, converts more or less of the\r\ninert nitrogenous organic matter into ammonia and nitric acid. This is\r\nprecisely what a farmer wants. It is just what the wheat crop needs. But\r\nwe must be very careful, when we render the nitrogen soluble, to have\r\nsome plant ready to take it up, and not let it be washed out of the soil\r\nduring the winter and early spring.\r\n\r\nWe have much poor land in the United States, and an immense area of\r\ngood land. The poor land will be used to grow timber, or be improved by\r\nconverting more or less of it, gradually, into pasture, and stocking it\r\nwith sheep and cattle. The main point is, to feed the sheep or cattle\r\nwith some rich nitrogenous food, such as cotton-seed cake, malt-sprouts,\r\nbran, shorts, mill-feed, refuse beans, or bean-meal made from beans\r\ninjured by the weevil, or bug. In short, the owner of such land must buy\r\nsuch food as will furnish the most nutriment and make the richest manure\r\nat the least cost--taking both of these objects into consideration.\r\nHe will also buy more or less artificial manures, to be used for the\r\nproduction of fodder crops, such as corn, millet, Hungarian grass, etc.\r\nand, as soon as a portion of the land can be made rich enough, he will\r\ngrow more or less mangel wurzels, sugar beets, turnips, and other root\r\ncrops. Superphosphate will be found admirably adapted for this purpose,\r\nand two, three, or four hundred pounds of cheap potash salts, per acre,\r\ncan frequently be used on fodder crops, in connection with two or three\r\nhundred pounds of superphosphate, with considerable profit. The whole\r\nsubject is well worthy of careful study. Never in the history of the\r\nworld has there been a grander opportunity for the application of\r\nscience to the improvement of agriculture than now.\r\n\r\nOn the richer lands, the aim of the farmer will be to convert the plant\r\nfood lying dormant in the soil into profitable crops. The main point is\r\n_good tillage_. In many cases weeds now run away with half our crops and\r\nall our profits. The weeds which spring up after the grain crops are\r\nharvested, are not an unmixed evil. They retain the nitrogen and other\r\nplant food, and when turned under make manure for the succeeding crops.\r\nBut weeds among the growing crop are evil, and only an evil. Thorough\r\nplowing is the remedy, accompanied by drainage where needed.\r\n\r\nWe have an immense number of farms on which there are both good and poor\r\nland. In such cases we must adopt a combined system. We must grow large\r\ncrops on the rich land and use them, at least in part, to make manure\r\nfor the poorer portions of the farm. Drainage and good tillage will\r\nconvert much of our low, alluvial lands into a perfect mine of wealth.\r\nAnd much of our high, rolling land consists of strong loam, abounding in\r\nplant food. Such land requires little more than thorough tillage, with\r\nperhaps two hundred pounds of superphosphate per acre, to enable it to\r\nproduce good grain crops.\r\n\r\nAfter all is said and done, farming is a business that requires not\r\nmerely science, but industry, economy, and common sense. The real basis\r\nof success is faith, accompanied with good works. I cannot illustrate\r\nthis better than by alluding to one of my neighbors, a strong, healthy,\r\nintelligent, observing and enterprising German, who commenced life as a\r\nfarm laborer, and is to-day worth at least one hundred thousand dollars,\r\nthat he has made, not by the advance of suburban property, but by\r\nfarming, pure and simple. He first rented a farm, and then bought it,\r\nand in a few years he bought another farm adjoining the first one, and\r\nwould to-day buy another if he found one that suited him. He has faith\r\nin farming. Some people think he “runs his land,” and, in fact, such is\r\nthe case. He keeps good teams, and good plows, and good harrows, and\r\ngood rollers, and good cultivators, and good grade Shorthorn cows. He\r\nacts as though he believed, as Sir John B. Lawes says, that “the soil is\r\na mine,” out of which he digs money. He runs his land for all it is\r\nworth. He raises wheat, barley, oats, corn, potatoes, and hay, and when\r\nhe can get a good price for his timothy hay, he draws it to market and\r\nsells it. Thorough tillage is the basis of his success. He is now using\r\nphosphates for wheat, and will probably increase his herd of cows and\r\nmake more manure. He has great faith in manure, but acts as though he\r\nhad still greater faith in good plowing, early sowing, and thorough\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Printers have got our “Talks on Manures” in type; and the publishers\r\nwant a Preface.\r\n\r\nThe Deacon is busy hoeing his corn; the Doctor is gone to Rice Lake,\r\nfishing; Charley is cultivating mangels; the Squire is haying, and I am\r\nhere alone, with a pencil in hand and a sheet of blank paper before me.\r\nI would far rather be at work. In fact, I have only just come in from\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nNow, what shall I say? It will do no good to apologize for the\r\ndeficiencies of the book. If the critics condescend to notice it at\r\nall, nothing I can say will propitiate their favor, or moderate their\r\ncensure. They are an independent set of fellows! I know them well, I am\r\nan old editor myself, and nothing would please me better than to sit\r\ndown and write a slashing criticism of these “Talks on Manures.”\r\n\r\nBut I am denied that pleasure. The critics have the floor.\r\n\r\nAll I will say here, is, that the book is what it pretends to be.\r\nSome people seem to think that the “Deacon” is a fictitious character.\r\nNothing of the kind. He is one of the oldest farmers in town, and\r\nlives on the farm next to me. I have the very highest respect for him.\r\nI have tried to report him fully and correctly. Of my own share in the\r\nconversations I will say little, and of the Doctor’s nothing. My own\r\nviews are honestly given. I hold myself responsible for them. I may\r\ncontradict in one chapter what I have asserted in another. And so,\r\nprobably, has the Deacon. I do not know whether this is or is not the\r\ncase. I know very well that on many questions “much can be said on both\r\nsides”--and very likely the Deacon is sometimes on the south side of the\r\nfence and I on the north side; and in the next chapter you may find the\r\nDeacon on the north side, and where would you have me go, except to the\r\nsouth side? We cannot see both sides of the fence, if both of us walk on\r\nthe same side!\r\n\r\nI fear some will be disappointed at not finding a particular subject\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nI have talked about those things which occupy my own thoughts. There are\r\nsome things not worth thinking about. There are others beyond my reach.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing about manures for cotton or for the sugar-cane--not\r\nbecause I feel no interest in the matter, but because I have had no\r\nexperience in the cultivation of these important crops. I might have\r\ntold what the crops contain, and could have given minute directions for\r\nfurnishing in manure the exact quantity of plant-food which the crops\r\nremove from the soil. But I have no faith in such a system of farming.\r\nThe few cotton-planters I have had the pleasure of seeing were men of\r\neducation and rare ability. I cannot undertake to offer them advice. But\r\nI presume they will find that, if they desire to increase the growth of\r\nthe cotton-plant, in nine cases out of ten they can do it, provided the\r\nsoil is properly worked, by supplying a manure containing available\r\nnitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. But the _proper proportion_ of\r\nthese ingredients of plant-food must be ascertained by experiment, and\r\nnot from a mere analysis of the cotton-plant.\r\n\r\nI have much faith in artificial manures. They will do great things for\r\nAmerican agriculture--directly, and indirectly. Their general use will\r\nlead to a higher system of farming--to better cultivation, more root and\r\nfodder crops, improved stock, higher feeding, and richer manure. But it\r\nhas been no part of my object to unduly extol the virtues of commercial\r\nmanures. That may be left to the manufacturers.\r\n\r\nMy sympathy is with the farmer, and especially with the farmer of\r\nmoderate means, who finds that improved farming calls for more and more\r\ncapital. I would like to encourage such a man. And so, in point of fact,\r\nwould the Deacon, though he often talks as though a man who tries to\r\nimprove his farm will certainly come to poverty. Such men as the\r\nDeacon are useful neighbors if their doubts, and head-shakings, and\r\nshoulder-shruggings lead a young and enthusiastic farmer to put more\r\nenergy, industry, and economy into his business. It is well to listen\r\nto the Deacon--to hear all his objections, and then to keep a sharp\r\nlook-out for the dangers and difficulties, and _go-ahead_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALKS ON MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nFARMING AS A BUSINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Farming is a poor business,” said the Deacon. “Take the corn crop.\r\nThirty bushels per acre is a fair average, worth, at 75 cents per\r\nbushel, $22.50. If we reckon that, for each bushel of corn, we get 100\r\nlbs. of stalks, this would be a ton and a half per acre, worth at $5 per\r\nton $7.50.”\r\n\r\n  Total receipts per acre for corn crop                     $30 00\r\n  Expenses.--Preparing the land for the crop         $5 00\r\n             Planting and seed                        1 50\r\n             Cultivating, three times,\r\n               twice in a row both ways               5 00\r\n             Hoeing twice                             3 00\r\n             Cutting up the corn                      1 50\r\n             Husking and drawing in the corn          4 00\r\n             Drawing in the stalks, etc.              1 00\r\n             Shelling, and drawing to market          2 00\r\n  Total cost of the crop                             -----  $23 00\r\n                                                            ------\r\n  Profit per acre                                            $7 00\r\n\r\n“And from this,” said the Deacon, “we have to deduct interest on land\r\nand taxes. I tell you, farming is a poor business.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, “_poor_ farming is a _very_ poor business. But _good_\r\nfarming, if we have good prices, is as good a business as I want, and\r\nwithal as pleasant. A good farmer raises 75 bushels of corn per acre,\r\ninstead of 30. He would get for his crop, including stalks\r\n\r\n                                                        $75 00\r\n  Expenses.--Preparing land for the crop         $5 00\r\n             Planting and seed                    1 50\r\n             Cultivating                          5 00\r\n             Hoeing                               3 00\r\n             Cutting up the corn                  1 50\r\n             Husking and drawing                 10 00\r\n             Drawing in the stalks                3 00\r\n             Shelling, etc.                       6 00\r\n                                                 -----  $35 00\r\n                                                        ------\r\n  Profit per acre                                       $40 00\r\n\r\nTake another case, which actually occurred in this neighborhood. The\r\nJudge is a good farmer, and particularly successful in raising potatoes\r\nand selling them at a good price to hotels and private families. He\r\ncultivates very thoroughly, plants in hills, and puts a handful of\r\nashes, plaster, and hen-manure, on the hill.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, his crop of Peachblows was at the rate of 208 bushels per acre.\r\nOf these, 200 bushels were sold at 60 cents per bushel. There were 8\r\nbushels of small potatoes, worth say 12½ cents per bushel, to feed out\r\nto stock.\r\n\r\nMr. Sloe, who lives on an adjoining farm, had three acres of Peachblow\r\npotatoes the same year. The yield was 100 bushels per acre--of which 25\r\nbushels were not large enough for market, he got 50 cents per bushel for\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nThe account of the two crops stands as follows:\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------+----------+---------\r\n           Expenses Per Acre:              | Mr. Sloe | Judge.\r\n  -----------------------------------------+----------+---------\r\n  Plowing, harrowing, rolling, marking,    |          |\r\n      planting and covering                | $ 8 00   | $ 8 00\r\n  Seed                                     |   5 00   |   5 00\r\n  Hoeing, cultivating, etc.                |   7 00   |  10 00\r\n  Digging                                  |  10 00   |  10 00\r\n                                           +----------+---------\r\n                                           |  30 00   |  33 00\r\n              _Receipts Per Acre_:         |          |\r\n  75 bushels, @ 50c                        |  37 50   |\r\n  25  ”       @ 12½c                       |   3 12   |\r\n                                           +----------+---------\r\n                                           |  40 62   |\r\n  200 bushels, @ 60c                       |          | 120 00\r\n    8   ”      @ 12½c                      |          |   1 00\r\n                                           |          +---------\r\n                                           |          | 121 00\r\n                                           +----------+---------\r\n  Profit per acre                          | $10 62   | $98 00\r\n  -----------------------------------------+----------+---------\r\n\r\nSince then, Mr. Sloe has been making and using more manure, and the year\r\nbefore last (1875) his crop of potatoes averaged over 200 bushels per\r\nacre, and on the sandy knolls, where more manure was applied, the yield\r\nwas at least 250 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said the Deacon, “I do not believe in ‘high farming.’ It\r\nwill not pay.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly not,” I replied. “It depends on circumstances; and these we\r\nwill talk about presently. High farming aims to get large crops every\r\nyear. _Good_ farming produces equally large crops per acre, but not so\r\nmany of them. This is what I am trying to do on my own farm. I am aiming\r\nto get 35 bushels of wheat per acre, 80 bushels of shelled corn, 50\r\nbushels of barley, 90 bushels of oats, 300 bushels of potatoes, and\r\n1,200 bushels of mangel-wurzel per acre, on the average. I can see no\r\nway of paying high wages except by raising large crops _per acre_. But\r\nif I get these large crops it does not necessarily follow that I am\r\npractising ‘high farming.’”\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: Suppose I should succeed in getting such crops by\r\nadopting the following plan. I have a farm of nearly 300 acres, one\r\nquarter of it being low, alluvial land, too wet for cultivation, but\r\nwhen drained excellent for pasturing cows or for timothy meadows.\r\nI drain this land, and after it is drained I dam up some of the streams\r\nthat flow into it or through it, and irrigate wherever I can make the\r\nwater flow. So much for the low land.\r\n\r\nThe upland portion of the farm, containing say 200 acres, exclusive of\r\nfences, roads, buildings, garden, etc., is a naturally fertile loam, as\r\ngood as the average wheat land of Western New York. But it is, or was,\r\nbadly “run down.” It had been what people call “worked to death;”\r\nalthough, in point of fact, it had not been half-worked. Some said it\r\nwas “wheated to death,” others that it had been “oated to death,” others\r\nthat it had been “grassed to death,” and one man said to me, “That field\r\nhas had sheep on it until they have gnawed every particle of vegetable\r\nmatter out of the soil, and it will not now produce enough to pasture a\r\nflock of geese.” And he was not far from right--notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat sheep are thought to be, and are, the best animals to enrich land.\r\nBut let me say, in passing, that I have since raised on that same field\r\n50 bushels of barley per acre, 33 bushels of Diehl wheat, a great crop\r\nof clover, and last year, on a part of it, over 1,000 bushels of\r\nmangel-wurzel per acre.\r\n\r\nBut this is a digression. Let us carry out the illustration. What does\r\nthis upland portion of the farm need? It needs underdraining, thorough\r\ncultivation, and _plenty of manure_. If I had plenty of manure, I could\r\nadopt high farming. But where am I to get plenty of manure for 200 acres\r\nof land? “Make it,” says the Deacon. Very good; but what shall I make it\r\nof? “Make it out of your straw and stalks and hay.” So I do, but all the\r\nstraw and stalks and hay raised on the farm when I bought it would not\r\nmake as much manure as “high farming” requires for five acres of land.\r\nAnd is this not true of half the farms in the United States to-day? What\r\nthen, shall we do?\r\n\r\nThe best thing to do, _theoretically_, is this: Any land that is\r\nproducing a fair crop of grass or clover, let it lie. Pasture it or mow\r\nit for hay. If you have a field of clayey or stiff loamy land, break it\r\nup in the fall, and summer-fallow it the next year, and sow it to wheat\r\nand seed it down with clover. Let it lie two or three years in clover.\r\nThen break it up in July or August, “fall-fallow” it, and sow it with\r\nbarley the next spring, and seed it down again with clover.\r\n\r\nSandy or light land, that it will not pay to summer-fallow, should have\r\nall the manure you can make, and be plowed and planted with corn.\r\nCultivate thoroughly, and either seed it down with the corn in August,\r\nor sow it to barley or oats next spring, and seed it down with clover.\r\nI say, _theoretically_ this is the best plan to adopt. But practically\r\nit may not be so, because it may be absolutely necessary that we should\r\nraise something that we can sell at once, and get money to live upon or\r\npay interest and taxes. But the gentlemen who so strenuously advocate\r\nhigh farming, are not perhaps often troubled with considerations of this\r\nkind. Meeting them, therefore, on their own ground, I contend that in my\r\ncase “high farming” would not be as profitable as the plan hinted at\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe rich alluvial low land is to be pastured or mown; the upland to be\r\nbroken up only when necessary, and when it is plowed to be plowed well\r\nand worked thoroughly, and got back again into clover as soon as\r\npossible. The hay and pasture from the low land, and the clover and\r\nstraw and stalks from the upland, would enable us to keep a good many\r\ncows and sheep, with more or less pigs, and there would be a big pile of\r\nmanure in the yard every spring. And when this is once obtained, you can\r\nget along much more pleasantly and profitably.\r\n\r\n\r\n“But,” I may be asked, “when you have got this pile of manure can not\r\nyou adopt high farming?” No. My manure pile would contain say: 60 tons\r\nof clover-hay; 20 tons wheat-straw; 25 tons oat, barley, and pea-straw;\r\n40 tons meadow-hay; 20 tons corn-stalks; 20 tons corn, oats, and other\r\ngrain; 120 tons mangel-wurzel and turnips.\r\n\r\nThis would give me about 500 tons of well-rotted manure. I should want\r\n200 tons of this for the mangels and turnips, and the 300 tons I should\r\nwant to top-dress 20 acres of grass land intended for corn and potatoes\r\nthe next year. My pile of manure, therefore, is all used up on 25 to 30\r\nacres of land. In other words, I use the unsold produce of 10 acres to\r\nmanure one. Is this “high farming?” I think in my circumstances it is\r\ngood farming, but it is not high farming. It gives me large crops per\r\nacre, but I have comparatively few acres in crops that are sold from the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\n“High farming,” if the term is to have any definite meaning at all\r\nshould only be used to express the idea of a farm so managed that the\r\nsoil is rich enough to produce maximum crops _every year_. If you adopt\r\nthe system of rotation quite general in this section--say, 1st year,\r\ncorn on sod; 2d, barley or oats; 3d, wheat; 4th, clover for hay and\r\nafterwards for seed; 5th, timothy and clover for hay; and then the 6th\r\nyear plowed up for corn again--it would be necessary to make the land\r\nrich enough to produce say 100 bushels shelled corn, 50 bushels of\r\nbarley, 40 bushels of wheat, 3 tons clover-hay, and 5 bushels of\r\nclover-seed, and 3 tons clover and timothy-hay per acre. This would be\r\n_moderate_ high farming. If we introduced lucern, Italian rye-grass,\r\ncorn-fodder, and mangel-wurzel into the rotation, we should need still\r\nricher land to produce a maximum growth of these crops. In other words,\r\nwe should need more manure.\r\n\r\nThe point I am endeavoring to get at, is this: Where you want a farm to\r\nbe self-supporting--where you depend solely on the produce of the farm\r\nto supply manure--it is a sheer impossibility to adopt high farming _on\r\nthe whole of your land_. I want to raise just as large crops per acre as\r\nthe high farmers, but there is no way of doing this, unless we go\r\noutside the farm for manure, without raising a smaller area of such\r\ncrops as are sold from the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not wish any one to suppose that I am opposed to high farming.\r\nThere is occasionally a farm where it may be practised with advantage,\r\nbut it seems perfectly clear to my mind that as long as there is such an\r\nunlimited supply of _land_, and such a limited supply of fertilizers,\r\nmost of us will find it more profitable to develop the latent stores of\r\nplant-food lying dormant in the soil rather than to buy manures. And it\r\nis certain that you can not adopt high farming without either buying\r\nmanure directly, or buying food to feed to animals that shall make\r\nmanure on the farm.\r\n\r\nAnd you must recollect that high farming requires an increased supply of\r\nlabor, and hired help is a luxury almost as costly as artificial\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have heard superficial thinkers object to agricultural papers on the\r\nground that they were urging farmers to improve their land and produce\r\nlarger crops, “while,” say they, “we are producing so much already that\r\nit will not sell for as much as it costs to produce it.” My plan of\r\nimproved agriculture does not necessarily imply the production of any\r\nmore wheat or of any more grain of any kind that we sell than we raise\r\nat present. I would simply raise it on fewer acres, and thus lessen the\r\nexpense for seed, cultivation, harvesting, etc. I would raise 30 bushels\r\nof wheat per acre every third year, instead of 10 bushels every year.\r\n\r\nIf we summer-fallowed and plowed under clover in order to produce the 30\r\nbushels of wheat once in three years, instead of 10 bushels every year,\r\nno more produce of any kind would be raised. But my plan does not\r\ncontemplate such a result. On my own farm I seldom summer-fallow, and\r\nnever plow under clover. I think I can enrich the farm nearly as much by\r\nfeeding the clover to animals and returning the manure to the land. The\r\nanimals do not take out more than from five to ten per cent of the more\r\nvaluable elements of plant-food from the clover. And so my plan, while\r\nit produces as much and no more grain to sell, adds greatly to the\r\nfertility of the land, and gives an increased production of beef,\r\nmutton, wool, butter, cheese, and pork.\r\n\r\n“But what is a man to do who is poor and has poor land?” If he has good\r\nhealth, is industrious, economical, and is possessed of a fair share of\r\ngood common sense, he need have no doubt as to being able to renovate\r\nhis farm and improve his own fortune.\r\n\r\nFaith in good farming is the first requisite. If this is weak, it will\r\nbe strengthened by exercise. If you have not faith, act as though you\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nWork hard, but do not be a drudge. A few hours’ vigorous labor will\r\naccomplish a great deal, and encourage you to continued effort. Be\r\nprompt, systematic, cheerful, and enthusiastic. Go to bed early and get\r\nup when you wake. But take sleep enough. A man had better be in bed than\r\nat the tavern or grocery. Let not friends, even, keep you up late;\r\n“manners is manners, but still your elth’s your elth.”\r\n\r\n“But what has this to do with good farming?” More than chemistry and all\r\nthe science of the schools. Agriculture is an art and must be followed\r\nas such. Science will help--help enormously--but it will never enable us\r\nto dispense with industry. Chemistry throws great light on the art of\r\ncooking, but a farmer’s wife will roast a turkey better than a Liebig.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. James O. Sheldon, of Geneva. N.Y., bought his farm, his entire\r\ncrop of hay the first year was 76 loads. He kept stock, and bought more\r\nor less grain and bran, and in eleven years from that time his farm\r\nproduced 430 loads of hay, afforded pasture for his large herd of\r\nShorthorn cattle, and produced quite as much grain as when he first took\r\nit.\r\n\r\nExcept in the neighborhood of large cities, “high farming” may not pay,\r\nowing to the fact that we have so much land. But whether this is so or\r\nnot, there can be no doubt that the only profitable system of farming is\r\nto raise large crops on such land as we cultivate. High farming gives us\r\nlarge crops, and _many of them_. At present, while we have so much land\r\nin proportion to population, we must, perhaps, be content with large\r\ncrops of grain, and few of them. We must adopt the slower but less\r\nexpensive means of enriching our land from natural sources, rather than\r\nthe quicker, more artificial, and costly means adopted by many farmers\r\nin England, and by market gardeners, seed-growers, and nurserymen in\r\nthis country. Labor is so high that we can not afford to raise a small\r\ncrop. If we sow but half the number of acres, and double the yield, we\r\nshould quadruple our profits. I have made up my mind to let the land lie\r\nin clover three years, instead of two. This will lessen the number of\r\nacres under cultivation, and enable us to bestow more care in plowing\r\nand cleaning it. And the land will be richer, and produce better crops.\r\nThe atmosphere is capable of supplying a certain quantity of ammonia to\r\nthe soil in rains and dews every year, and by giving the wheat crop a\r\nthree years supply instead of two years, we gain so much. Plaster the\r\nclover, top-dress it in the fall, if you have the manure, and stimulate\r\nits growth in every way possible, and consume all the clover on the\r\nland, or in the barn-yard. Do not sell a single ton; let not a weed\r\ngrow, and the land will certainly improve.\r\n\r\nThe first object should be to destroy weeds. I do not know how it is in\r\nother sections, but with us the majority of farms are completely overrun\r\nwith weeds. They are eating out the life of the land, and if something\r\nis not done to destroy them, even exorbitantly high prices can not make\r\nfarming profitable. A farmer yesterday was contending that it did not\r\npay to summer-fallow. He has taken a run-down farm, and a year ago last\r\nspring he plowed up ten acres of a field, and sowed it to barley and\r\noats. The remainder of the field he summer-fallowed, plowing it four\r\ntimes, rolling and harrowing thoroughly after each plowing. After the\r\nbarley and oats were off, he plowed the land once, harrowed it and sowed\r\nMediterranean wheat. On the summer-fallow he drilled in Diehl wheat. He\r\nhas just threshed, and got 22 bushels per acre of Mediterranean wheat\r\nafter the spring crop, at one plowing, and 26 bushels per acre of Diehl\r\nwheat on the summer-fallow. This, he said, would not pay, as it cost him\r\n$20 per acre to summer-fallow, and he lost the use of the land for one\r\nseason. Now this may be all true, and yet it is no argument against\r\nsummer-fallowing. Wait a few years. Farming is slow work. Mr. George\r\nGeddes remarked to me, when I told him I was trying to renovate a\r\nrun-down farm, “you will find it the work of your life.” We ought not to\r\nexpect a big crop on poor, run-down land, simply by plowing it three or\r\nfour times in as many months. Time is required for the chemical changes\r\nto take place in the soil. But watch the effect on the clover for the\r\nnext two years, and when the land is plowed again, see if it is not in\r\nfar better condition than the part not summer-fallowed. I should expect\r\nthe clover on the summer-fallow to be fully one-third better in\r\nquantity, and of better quality than on the other part, and this extra\r\nquantity of clover will make an extra quantity of good manure, and thus\r\nwe have the means of going on with the work of improving the farm.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Doctor, “and there will also be more clover-roots in the\r\nsoil.”\r\n\r\n“But I can not afford to wait for clover, and summer-fallowing,” writes\r\nan intelligent New York gentleman, a dear lover of good stock, who has\r\nbought an exhausted New England farm, “I must have a portion of it\r\nproducing good crops right off.” Very well. A farmer with plenty of\r\nmoney can do wonders in a short time. Set a gang of ditchers to work,\r\nand put in underdrains where most needed. Have teams and plows enough to\r\ndo the work rapidly. As soon as the land is drained and plowed, put on a\r\nheavy roller. Then sow 500 lbs. of Peruvian guano per acre broadcast, or\r\nits equivalent in some other fertilizer. Follow with a Shares’ harrow.\r\nThis will mellow the surface and cover the guano without disturbing the\r\nsod. Follow with a forty-toothed harrow, and roll again, if needed,\r\nworking the land until there is three or four inches of fine, mellow\r\nsurface soil. Then mark off the land in rows as straight as an arrow,\r\nand plant corn. Cultivate thoroughly, and kill every weed. If the\r\nditchers can not get through until it is too late to plant corn, drill\r\nin beans on the last drained part of the field.\r\n\r\nAnother good crop to raise on a stock farm is corn-fodder. This can be\r\ndrilled in from time to time as the land can be got ready. Put on half a\r\nton of guano per acre and harrow in, and then mark off the rows three\r\nfeet apart, and drill in four bushels of corn per acre. Cultivate\r\nthoroughly, and expect a great crop. By the last of July, the Ayrshire\r\ncows will take kindly to the succulent corn-fodder, and with three or\r\nfour quarts of meal a day, it will enable each of them to make 10 lbs.\r\nof butter a week.\r\n\r\nFor the pigs, sow a few acres of peas. These will do well on sod-land,\r\nsown early or late, or a part early and a part late, as most convenient.\r\nSow broadcast and harrow in, 500 lbs. of Peruvian guano per acre and 200\r\nlbs. of gypsum. Drill in three bushels of peas per acre, or sow\r\nbroadcast, and cover them with a Shares’ harrow. Commence to feed the\r\ncrop green as soon as the pods are formed, and continue to feed out the\r\ncrop, threshed or unthreshed, until the middle of November. Up to this\r\ntime the bugs do comparatively little damage. The pigs will thrive\r\nwonderfully on this crop, and make the richest and best of manure.\r\n\r\nI have little faith in any attempt to raise root crops on land not\r\npreviously well prepared. But as it is necessary to have some\r\nmangel-wurzel and Swede turnips for the Ayrshire cows and long-wool\r\nsheep next winter and spring, select the cleanest and richest land that\r\ncan be found that was under cultivation last season. If fall plowed, the\r\nchances of success will be doubled. Plow the land two or three times,\r\nand cultivate, harrow, and roll until it is as mellow as a garden. Sow\r\n400 lbs. of Peruvian guano and 300 lbs. of good superphosphate per acre\r\nbroadcast, and harrow them in. Ridge up the land into ridges 2½ to 3 ft.\r\napart, with a double mould-board plow. Roll down the ridges with a light\r\nroller, and drill in the seed. Sow the mangel-wurzel in May--the earlier\r\nthe better--and the Swedes as soon afterwards as the land can be\r\nthoroughly prepared. Better delay until June rather than sow on rough\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe first point on such a farm will be to attend to the grass land. This\r\naffords the most hopeful chance of getting good returns the first year.\r\nBut no time is to be lost. Sow 500 lbs. of Peruvian guano per acre on\r\nall the grass land and on the clover, with 200 lbs. of gypsum in\r\naddition on the latter. If this is sown early enough, so that the spring\r\nrains dissolve it and wash it into the soil, great crops of grass may be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n“But will it pay?” My friend in New York is a very energetic and\r\nsuccessful business man, and he has a real love for farming, and I have\r\nno sort of doubt that, taking the New York business and the farm\r\ntogether, they will afford a very handsome profit. Furthermore, I have\r\nno doubt that if, after he has drained it, he would cover the whole farm\r\nwith 500 lbs. of Peruvian guano per acre, or its equivalent, it would\r\npay him better than any other agricultural operation he is likely to\r\nengage in. By the time it was on the land the cost would amount to about\r\n$20 per acre. If he sells no more grass or hay from the farm than he\r\nwould sell if he did not use the guano, this $20 may very properly be\r\nadded to the permanent capital invested in the farm. And in this aspect\r\nof the case, I have no hesitation in saying it will pay a high rate of\r\ninterest. His bill for labor will be as much in one case as in the\r\nother; and if he uses the guano he will probably double his crops. His\r\ngrass lands will carry twenty cows instead of ten, and if he raises the\r\ncorn-fodder and roots, he can probably keep thirty cows better than he\r\ncould otherwise keep a dozen; and, having to keep a herdsman in either\r\ncase, the cost of labor will not be much increased. “But you think it\r\nwill not pay?” It will probably not pay _him_. I do not think _his_\r\nbusiness would pay me if I lived on my farm, and went to New York only\r\nonce or twice a week. If there is one business above all others that\r\nrequires constant attention, it is farming--and especially\r\nstock-farming. But my friend is right in saying that he cannot afford to\r\nwait to enrich his land by clover and summer-fallowing. His land costs\r\ntoo much; he has a large barn and everything requisite to keep a large\r\nstock of cattle and sheep. The interest on farm and buildings, and the\r\nmoney expended in labor, would run on while the dormant matter in the\r\nsoil was slowly becoming available under the influence of good tillage.\r\nThe large barn must be filled at once, and the only way to do this is to\r\napply manure with an unsparing hand. If he lived on the farm, I should\r\nhave no doubt that, by adopting this course, and by keeping improved\r\nstock, and feeding liberally, he could make money. Perhaps he can find a\r\nman who will successfully manage the farm under his direction, but the\r\nprobabilities are that his present profit and pleasure will come from\r\nthe gratification of his early love for country life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS MANURE?\r\n\r\n\r\n“What is the good of asking such a question as that?” said the Deacon;\r\n“we all know what manure is.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” I replied, “tell us what it is?”\r\n\r\n“_It is anything that will make crops grow better and bigger_,” replied\r\nthe Deacon.\r\n\r\n“That is not a bad definition,” said I; “but let us see if it is a true\r\none. You have two rows of cabbage in the garden, and you water one row,\r\nand the plants grow bigger and better. Is _water_ manure? You cover a\r\nplant with a hand-glass, and it grows bigger and better. Is a hand-glass\r\nmanure? You shelter a few plants, and they grow bigger and better. Is\r\nshelter manure? You put some pure sand round a few plants, and they grow\r\nbigger and better. Is pure sand manure? I think we shall have to reject\r\nthe Deacon’s definition.”\r\n\r\nLet us hear what the Doctor has to say on the subject.\r\n\r\n“Manure,” replied the Doctor, “is the _food of plants_.”\r\n\r\n“That is a better definition,” said I; “but this is really not answering\r\nthe question. You say manure is plant-food. But what is plant-food?”\r\n\r\n“Plant-food,” said the Doctor, “is composed of twelve elements, and,\r\npossibly, sometimes one or two more, which we need not here talk about.\r\nFour of these elements are gases, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and\r\nnitrogen. When a plant or animal is burnt, these gases are driven off.\r\nThe ashes which remain are composed of potash, soda, lime, and magnesia;\r\nsulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, chlorine, and silica. In other words,\r\nthe ‘food of plants’ is composed of four organic, or gaseous elements,\r\nand eight inorganic, or mineral elements, of which four have acid and\r\nfour alkaline properties.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Doctor,” said the Deacon, “I am glad to know what manure is.\r\nIt is the food of plants, and the food of plants is composed of four\r\ngases, four acid and four alkaline elements. I seem to know all about\r\nit. All I have wanted to make my land rich was plenty of manure, and now\r\nI shall know where to get it--oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen;\r\nthese four atmospheric elements. Then potash, soda, magnesia, and lime.\r\nI know what these four are. Then sulphur, phosphorous, silica (sand,)\r\nand chlorine (salt). I shall soon have rich land and big crops.”\r\n\r\nCharley, who has recently come home from college, where he has been\r\nstudying chemistry, looked at the Deacon, and was evidently puzzled to\r\nunderstand him. Turning to the Doctor, Charley asked modestly if what\r\nthe Doctor had said in regard to the composition of plant food could not\r\nbe said of the composition of all our animals and plants.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied the Doctor, “all our agricultural plants and all\r\nour animals, man included, are composed of these twelve elements,\r\noxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen; phosphorus, sulphur, silica,\r\nchlorine, potash, soda, magnesia, and lime.”\r\n\r\nCharley said something about lime, potash, and soda, not being\r\n“elements;” and something about silica and chlorine not being found in\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “and he has left out _iron_, which is an important\r\nconstituent of all our farm crops and animals.” Neither the Doctor nor\r\nthe Deacon heard our remarks. The Deacon, who loves an argument,\r\nexclaimed: “I thought I knew all about it. You told us that manure was\r\nthe food of plants, and that the food of plants was composed of the\r\nabove twelve elements; and now you tell us that man and beast, fruit and\r\nflower, grain and grass, root, stem, and branch, all are composed or\r\nmade up of these same dozen elements. If I ask you what bread is made\r\nof, you say it is composed of the dozen elements aforesaid. If I ask\r\nwhat wheat-straw is made of, you answer, the _dozen_. If I ask what a\r\nthistle is made of, you say the dozen. There are a good many milk-weeds\r\nin my strawberry patch, and I am glad to know that the milk-weed and the\r\nstrawberry are both composed of the same dozen elements. Manure is the\r\nfood of plants, and the food of plants is composed of the above dozen\r\nelements, and every plant and animal that we eat is also composed of\r\nthese same dozen elements, and so I suppose there is no difference\r\nbetween an onion and an omelet, or between bread and milk, or between\r\nmangel-wurzel and manure.”\r\n\r\n“The difference,” replied the Doctor, “is one of proportion. Mangels and\r\nmanure are both composed of the same elements. In fact, mangels make\r\ngood manure, and good manure makes good mangels.”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon and the Doctor sat down to a game of backgammon, and Charley\r\nand I continued the conversation more seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ABOUT PLANT-FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Doctor is in the main correct,” said I; “but he does not fully\r\nanswer the question, ‘What is manure?’ To say that manure is plant-food,\r\ndoes not cover the whole ground. All soils on which plants grow, contain\r\nmore or less plant-food. A plant can not create an atom of potash. It\r\ncan not get it from the atmosphere. We find potash in the plant, and we\r\nknow that it got it from the soil and we are certain, therefore, that\r\nthe soil contains potash. And so of all the other mineral elements of\r\nplants. A soil that will produce a thistle, or a pig-weed, contains\r\nplant-food. And so the definition of the Doctor is defective, inasmuch\r\nas it makes no distinction between soil and manure. Both contain\r\nplant-food.”\r\n\r\n“What is your definition of manure?” asked Charley; “it would seem as\r\nthough we all knew what manure was. We have got a great heap of it in\r\nthe yard, and it is fermenting nicely.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, “we are making more manure on the farm this winter\r\nthan ever before. Two hundred pigs, 120 large sheep, 8 horses, 11 cows,\r\nand a hundred head of poultry make considerable manure; and it is a good\r\ndeal of work to clean out the pens, pile the manure, draw it to the\r\nfield, and apply it to the crops. We ought to know something about it;\r\nbut we might work among manure all our lives, and not know what manure\r\nis. At any rate, we might not be able to define it accurately. I will,\r\nhowever, try my hand at a definition.\r\n\r\n“Let us assume that we have a field that is free from stagnant water at\r\nall seasons of the year; that the soil is clean, mellow, and well worked\r\nseven inches deep, and in good order for putting in a crop. What the\r\ncoming ‘_season_’ will be we know not. It may be what we call a hot, dry\r\nsummer, or it may be cool and moist, or it may be partly one and partly\r\nthe other. The ‘season’ is a great element of uncertainty in all our\r\nfarming calculations; but we know that we shall have a season of some\r\nkind. We have the promise of seed-time and harvest, and we have never\r\nknown the promise to fail us. Crops, however, vary very much, according\r\nto the season; and it is necessary to bear this fact in mind. Let us say\r\nthat the sun and heat, and rain and dews, or what we call ‘the season,’\r\nis capable of producing 50 bushels of wheat per acre, but that the soil\r\nI have described above, does not produce over 20 bushels per acre. There\r\nis no mechanical defect in the soil. The seed is good, it is put in\r\nproperly, and at the right time, and in the best manner. No weeds choke\r\nthe wheat plants or rob them of their food; but that field does not\r\nproduce as much wheat by 30 bushels per acre as the _season_ is capable\r\nof producing. Why? The answer is evident. _Because the wheat plants do\r\nnot find food enough in the soil._ Now, anything that will furnish this\r\nfood, anything that will cause that field to produce what the climate or\r\nseason is capable of producing, is manure. A gardener may increase his\r\ncrops by artificial heat, or by an increased supply of water, but this\r\nis not manure. The effect is due to improved climatic conditions. It has\r\nnothing to do with the question of manure. We often read in the\r\nagricultural papers about ‘_shade_ as manure.’ We might just as well\r\ntalk about _sunlight_ as ‘manure.’ The effects observed should be\r\nreferred to modifications of the climate or season; and so in regard to\r\nmulching. A good mulch may often produce a larger increase of growth\r\nthan an application of manure. But mulch, proper, is not manure. It is\r\nclimate. It checks evaporation of moisture from the soil. We might as\r\nwell speak of rain as manure as to call a mulch manure. In fact, an\r\nordinary shower in summer is little more than a mulch. It does not reach\r\nthe roots of plants; and yet we see the effect of the shower immediately\r\nin the increased vigor of the plants. They are full of sap, and the\r\ndrooping leaves look refreshed. We say the rain has revived them, and so\r\nit has; but probably not a particle of the rain has entered into the\r\ncirculation of the plant. The rain checked evaporation from the soil and\r\nfrom the leaves. A cool night refreshes the plants, and fills the leaves\r\nwith sap, precisely in the same way. All these fertilizing effects,\r\nhowever, belong to climate. It is inaccurate to associate either\r\nmulching, sunshine, shade, heat, dews, or rain, with the question of\r\nmanure, though the effect may in certain circumstances be precisely the\r\nsame.”\r\n\r\nCharley evidently thought I was wandering from the point. “You think,\r\nthen,” said he, “manure is _plant-food that the soil needs?_”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “that is a very good definition--very good, indeed,\r\nthough not absolutely accurate, because manure is manure, whether a\r\nparticular soil needs it or not.” Unobserved by us, the Deacon and the\r\nDoctor had been listening to our talk. --“I would like,” said the\r\nDeacon, “to hear you give a better definition than Charley has given.”\r\n--“Manure,” said I, “is anything containing an element or elements of\r\nplant-food, which, if the soil needed it, would, if supplied in\r\nsufficient quantity, and in an available condition, produce, according\r\nto soil, season, climate, and variety, a maximum crop.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNATURAL MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe often hear about “natural” manure. I do not like the term, though I\r\nbelieve it originated with me. It is not accurate; not definite enough.\r\n\r\n“I do not know what you mean by natural manure,” said the Deacon,\r\n“unless it is the droppings of animals.” --“To distinguish them,\r\nI suppose,” said the Doctor, “from artificial manures, such as\r\nsuperphosphate, sulphate of ammonia, and nitrate of soda.” --“No; that\r\nis not how I used the term. A few years ago, we used to hear much in\r\nregard to the ‘exhaustion of soils.’ I thought this phrase conveyed a\r\nwrong idea. When new land produces large crops, and when, after a few\r\nyears, the crops get less and less, we were told that the farmers were\r\nexhausting their land. I said, no; the farmers are not exhausting the\r\n_soil_; they are merely exhausting the accumulated plant-food in the\r\nsoil. In other words, they are using up the _natural manure_.\r\n\r\n“Take my own farm. Fifty years ago, it was covered with a heavy growth\r\nof maple, beech, black walnut, oak, and other trees. These trees had\r\nshed annual crops of leaves for centuries. The leaves rot on the ground;\r\nthe trees also, age after age. These leaves and other organic matter\r\nform what I have called natural manure. When the land is cleared up and\r\nplowed, this natural manure decays more rapidly than when the land lies\r\nundisturbed; precisely as a manure-pile will ferment and decay more\r\nrapidly if turned occasionally, and exposed to the air. The plowing and\r\ncultivating renders this natural manure more readily available. The\r\nleaves decompose, and furnish food for the growing crop.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEXHAUSTION OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\n“You think, then,” said the Doctor, “that when a piece of land is\r\ncleared of the forest, harrowed, and sown to wheat; plowed and planted\r\nto corn, and the process repeated again and again, until the land no\r\nlonger yields profitable crops, that it is the ‘natural manure,’ and not\r\nthe soil, that is exhausted?”\r\n\r\n“I think the _soil_, at any rate, is not exhausted, and I can easily\r\nconceive of a case where even the natural manure is very far from being\r\nall used up.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then,” asked the Deacon, “is the land so poor that it will\r\nscarcely support a sheep to the acre?”\r\n\r\n“Simply because the natural manure and other plant-food which the soil\r\ncontains is not in an available condition. It lies dead and inert. It is\r\nnot soluble, and the roots of the plants cannot get enough of it to\r\nenable them to thrive; and in addition to this, you will find as a\r\nmatter of fact that these poor ‘exhausted’ farms are infested with\r\nweeds, which rob the growing crops of a large part of the scanty supply\r\nof available plant-food.”\r\n\r\n“But these weeds,” said the Deacon, “are not removed from the farm. They\r\nrot on the land; nothing is lost.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said I, “but they, nevertheless, rob the growing crops of\r\navailable plant-food. The annual supply of plant-food, instead of being\r\nused to grow useful plants, is used to grow weeds.”\r\n\r\n“I understand that,” said the Deacon, “but if the weeds are left on the\r\nland, and the useful plants are sold, the farmer who keeps his land\r\nclean would exhaust his land faster than the careless farmer who lets\r\nhis land lie until it is overrun with thistles, briars, and pig-weed.\r\nYou agricultural writers, who are constantly urging us to farm better\r\nand grow larger crops, seem to overlook this point. As you know, I do\r\nnot take much stock in chemical theories as applied to agriculture, but\r\nas you do, here is a little extract I cut from an agricultural paper,\r\nthat seems to prove that the better you work your land, and the larger\r\ncrops you raise, the sooner you exhaust your land.”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon put on his spectacles, drew his chair nearer the lamp on the\r\ntable, and read the following:\r\n\r\n“There is, on an average, about one-fourth of a pound of potash to every\r\none hundred pounds of soil, and about one-eighth of a pound of\r\nphosphoric acid, and one-sixteenth of a pound of sulphuric acid. If the\r\npotatoes and the tops are continually removed from the soil, it will\r\nsoon exhaust the potash. If the wheat and straw are removed, it will\r\nsoon exhaust the phosphate of lime; if corn and the stalks, it will soon\r\nexhaust the sulphuric acid. Unless there is a rotation, or the material\r\nthe plant requires is supplied from abroad, your crops will soon run\r\nout, though the soil will continue rich for other plants.”\r\n\r\n“That extract,” said I, “carries one back twenty-five years. We used to\r\nhave article after article in this strain. We were told that ‘always\r\ntaking meal out of the tub soon comes to the bottom,’ and always taking\r\npotash and phosphoric acid from the soil will soon exhaust the supply.\r\nBut, _practically_, there is really little danger of our exhausting the\r\nland. It does not pay. The farmer’s resources will be exhausted long\r\nbefore he can exhaust his farm.”\r\n\r\n“Assuming,” said the Doctor, who is fond of an argument, “that the above\r\nstatement is true, let us look at the facts. An acre of soil, 12 inches\r\ndeep, would weigh about 1,600 tons; and if, as the writer quoted by the\r\nDeacon states, the soil contains 4 ozs. of potash in every 100 lbs. of\r\nsoil, it follows that an acre of soil, 12 inches deep, contains 8,000\r\nlbs. of potash. Now, potatoes contain about 20 per cent of dry matter,\r\nand this dry matter contains say, 4 per cent of ash, half of which is\r\npotash. It follows, therefore, that 250 bushels of potatoes contain\r\nabout 60 lbs. of potash. If we reckon that the tops contain 20 lbs.\r\nmore, or 80 lbs. in all, it follows that the acre of soil contains\r\npotash enough to grow an _annual_ crop of 250 bushels of potatoes per\r\nacre for one hundred years.”\r\n\r\n“I know farmers,” said Charley, “who do not get over 50 bushels of\r\npotatoes per acre, and in that case the potash would last five hundred\r\nyears, as the weeds grown with the crop are left on the land, and do\r\nnot, according to the Deacon, exhaust the soil.”\r\n\r\n“Good for you, Charley,” said the Doctor. “Now let us see about the\r\nphosphoric acid, of which the soil, according to the above statement,\r\ncontains only half as much as it contains of potash, or 4,000 lbs. per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n“A crop of wheat of 30 bushels per acre,” continued the Doctor,\r\n“contains in the grain about 26 lbs. of ash, and we will say that half\r\nof this ash is phosphoric acid, or 13 lbs. Allowing that the straw,\r\nchaff, etc., contain 7 lbs. more, we remove from the soil in a crop of\r\nwheat of 30 bushels per acre, 20 lbs. of phosphoric acid, and so,\r\naccording to the above estimate, an acre of soil contains phosphoric\r\nacid to produce annually a crop of wheat and straw of 30 bushels per\r\nacre for _two hundred years_.\r\n\r\n“The writer of the paragraph quoted by the Deacon,” continued the\r\nDoctor, “selected the crops and elements best suited to his purpose, and\r\nyet, according to his own estimate, there is sufficient potash and\r\nphosphoric acid in the first 12 inches of the soil to enable us to raise\r\nunusually large crops until the next Centennial in 1976.\r\n\r\n“But let us take another view of the subject,” continued the Doctor. “No\r\nintelligent farmer removes all the potatoes _and tops_, all the wheat,\r\nstraw, and chaff, or all the corn and stalks from his farm. According to\r\nDr. Salisbury, a crop of corn of 75 bushels per acre removes from the\r\nsoil 600 lbs. of ash, but the _grain_ contains only 46 lbs. The other\r\n554 lbs. is contained in the stalks, etc., all of which are usually\r\nretained on the farm. It follows from this, that when only the grain is\r\nsold off the farm, it takes more than thirteen crops to remove as much\r\nmineral matter from the soil as is contained in the whole of one crop.\r\nAgain, the ash of the grain contains less than 3 per cent of sulphuric\r\nacid, so that the 46 lbs. of ash, in 75 bushels of corn, contains less\r\nthan 1½ lbs. of sulphuric acid, and thus, if an acre of soil contains\r\n2,000 lbs. of sulphuric acid, we have sufficient for an annual crop of\r\n75 bushels per acre for fifteen hundred years!\r\n\r\n“As I said before,” continued the Doctor, “intelligent farmers seldom\r\nsell their straw, and they frequently purchase and consume on the farm\r\nnearly as much bran, shorts, etc., as is sent to market with the grain\r\nthey sell. In the ‘Natural History of New York,’ it is stated that an\r\nacre of wheat in Western New York, of 30 bushels per acre, including\r\nstraw, chaff, etc., removes from the soil 144 lbs. of mineral matter.\r\nGenesee wheat usually yields about 80 per cent. of flour. This flour\r\ncontains only 0.7 per cent of mineral matter, while fine middlings\r\ncontain 4 per cent; coarse middlings, 5½ per cent; shorts, 8 per cent,\r\nand bran 8½ per cent of mineral matter or ash. It follows from this,\r\nthat out of the 144 lbs. of mineral matter in the crop of wheat, less\r\nthan 10 lbs. is contained in the flour. The remaining 134 lbs. is found\r\nin the straw, chaff, bran, shorts, etc., which a good farmer is almost\r\nsure to feed out on his farm. But even if the farmer feeds out none of\r\nhis wheat-bran, but sells it all with his wheat, the 30 bushels of wheat\r\nremove from the soil only 26 lbs. of mineral matter; and it would take\r\nmore than five crops to remove as much mineral matter as one crop of\r\nwheat and straw contains. Allowing that half the ash of wheat is\r\nphosphoric acid, 30 bushels remove only 13 lbs. from the soil, and if\r\nthe soil contains 4,000 lbs., it will take three hundred and seven\r\ncrops, of 30 bushels each, to exhaust it.”\r\n\r\n“That is to say,” said Charley, “if all the straw and chaff is retained\r\non the farm, and is returned to the land without loss of phosphoric\r\nacid.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Doctor, “and if all the bran and shorts, etc., were\r\nretained on the farm, it would take eight hundred crops to exhaust the\r\nsoil of phosphoric acid; and it is admitted that of all the elements of\r\nplant-food, phosphoric acid is the one first to be exhausted from the\r\nsoil.”\r\n\r\nI have sold some timothy hay this winter, and propose to do so whenever\r\nthe price suits. But some of my neighbors, who do not hesitate to sell\r\ntheir own hay, think I ought not to do so, because I “write for the\r\npapers”! It ought to satisfy them to know that I bring back 30 cwt. of\r\nbran for every ton of hay I sell. My rule is to sell nothing but wheat,\r\nbarley, beans, potatoes, clover-seed, apples, wool, mutton, beef, pork,\r\nand butter. Everything else is consumed on the farm--corn, peas, oats,\r\nmustard, rape, mangels, clover, straw, stalks, etc. Let us make a rough\r\nestimate of how much is sold and how much retained on a hundred-acre\r\nfarm, leaving out the potatoes, beans, and live-stock. We have say:\r\n\r\n    Sold.\r\n  15 acres wheat,  @ 40 bushels per acre                  18 tons\r\n   5   ”   barley, @ 50    ”       ”                       6  ”\r\n  15   ”   clover seed, 4  ”       ”                       1¾ ton.\r\n                                                          ------\r\n        Total sold                                        25¾ tons.\r\n\r\n    Retained on the farm.\r\n  15 acres corn, @ 80 bushels per acre                    33½ tons.\r\n  Corn stalks from do.                                    40   ”\r\n   5 acres barley straw                                    8   ”\r\n  10   ”   oats and peas, equal 80 bushels of oats        12¾  ”\r\n  Straw from do.                                          20   ”\r\n  15 acres wheat-straw                                    25   ”\r\n  15   ”   clover-hay                                     25   ”\r\n  Clover-seed straw                                       10   ”\r\n  15 acres pasture and meadow, equal 40 tons hay          40   ”\r\n   5   ”   mustard, equal 10 tons hay                     10   ”\r\n   5   ”   rape, equal 10 tons hay                        10   ”\r\n   5   ”   mangels, 25 tons per acre,                     15   ”\r\n               equal to 3 tons dry\r\n  Leaves from do.                                          3   ”\r\n                                                         -------\r\n          Total retained on the farm                     252¼ tons.\r\n\r\nIt would take a good many years to exhaust any ordinary soil by such a\r\ncourse of cropping. Except, perhaps, the sandy knolls, I think there is\r\nnot an acre on my farm that would be exhausted in ten thousand years,\r\nand as some portions of the low alluvial soil will grow crops without\r\nmanure, there will be an opportunity to give the poor, sandy knolls more\r\nthan their share of plant-food. In this way, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat we sell produce and bring nothing back, I believe the whole farm\r\nwill gradually increase in productiveness. The plant-food annually\r\nrendered available from the decomposition and disintegration of the\r\ninert organic and mineral matter in the soil, will be more than equal to\r\nthat exported from the farm. If the soil becomes deficient in anything,\r\nit is likely that it will be in phosphates, and a little superphosphate\r\nor bone-dust might at any rate be profitably used on the rape, mustard,\r\nand turnips.\r\n\r\nThe point in good farming is to develop from the latent stores in the\r\nsoil, and to accumulate enough available plant-food for the production\r\nof the largest possible yield of those crops which we sell. In other\r\nwords, we want enough available plant-food in the soil to grow 40\r\nbushels of wheat and 50 bushels of barley. I think the farmer who raises\r\n10 tons for every ton he sells, will soon reach this point, and when\r\nonce reached, it is a comparatively easy matter to maintain this degree\r\nof fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY OUR CROPS ARE SO POOR.\r\n\r\n“If the soil is so rich in plant-food,” said the Deacon, “I again ask,\r\nwhy are our crops so poor?”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon said this very quietly. He did not seem to know that he had\r\nasked one of the most important questions in the whole range of\r\nagricultural science. It is a fact that a soil may contain enough\r\nplant-food to produce a thousand large crops, and yet the crops we\r\nobtain from it may be so poor as hardly to pay the cost of cultivation.\r\nThe plant-food is there, but the plants cannot get at it. It is not in\r\nan available condition; it is not soluble. A case is quoted by Prof.\r\nJohnson, where a soil was analyzed, and found to contain to the depth of\r\none foot 4,652 lbs. of nitrogen per acre, but only 63 lbs. of this was\r\nin an available condition. And this is equally true of phosphoric acid,\r\npotash, and other elements of plant-food. No matter how much plant-food\r\nthere may be in the soil, the only portion that is of any immediate\r\nvalue is the small amount that is annually available for the growth of\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO GET LARGER CROPS.\r\n\r\n“I am tired of so much talk about plant-food,” said the Deacon; “what we\r\nwant to know is how to make our land produce larger crops of wheat,\r\ncorn, oats, barley, potatoes, clover, and grass.”\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what I am trying to show. On my own farm, the three\r\nleading objects are (1) to get the land drained, (2) to make it clean\r\nand mellow, and (3) to get available nitrogen for the cereal crops.\r\nAfter the first two objects are accomplished, the measure of\r\nproductiveness will be determined by the amount of available nitrogen in\r\nthe soil. How to get available nitrogen, therefore, is my chief and\r\nultimate object in all the operations on the farm, and it is here that\r\nscience can help me. I know how to get nitrogen, but I want to get it in\r\nthe cheapest way, and then to be sure that I do not waste it.\r\n\r\nThere is one fact fully established by repeated experiment and general\r\nexperience--that 80 lbs. of available nitrogen per acre, applied in\r\nmanure, will almost invariably give us a greatly increased yield of\r\ngrain crops. I should expect, on my farm, that on land which, without\r\nmanure, would give me 15 bushels of wheat per acre, such a dressing of\r\nmanure would give me, in a favorable season, 35 or 40 bushels per acre,\r\nwith a proportional increase of straw; and, in addition to this, there\r\nwould be considerable nitrogen left for the following crop of clover. Is\r\nit not worth while making an earnest effort to get this 80 lbs. of\r\navailable nitrogen?\r\n\r\nI have on my farm many acres of low, mucky land, bordering on the creek,\r\nthat probably contain several thousand pounds of nitrogen per acre. So\r\nlong as the land is surcharged with water, this nitrogen, and other\r\nplant-food, lies dormant. But drain it, and let in the air, and the\r\noxygen decomposes the organic matter, and ammonia and nitric acid are\r\nproduced. In other words, we get _available_ nitrogen and other\r\nplant-food, and the land becomes capable of producing large crops of\r\ncorn and grass; and the crops obtained from this low, rich land, will\r\nmake manure for the poorer, upland portions of the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSWAMP-MUCK OR PEAT AS MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It would pay you,” said the Deacon, “to draw out 200 or 300 loads of\r\nmuck from the swamp every year, and compost it with your manure.”\r\n\r\nThis may or may not be the case. It depends on the composition of the\r\nmuck, and how much labor it takes to handle it.\r\n\r\n“What you should do,” said the Doctor, “is to commence at the creek, and\r\nstraighten it. Take a gang of men, and be with them with yourself, or\r\nget a good foreman to direct operations. Commence at _a_, and straighten\r\nthe creek to _b_, and from _b_ to _c_ (see map on next page). Throw all\r\nthe rich, black muck in a heap by itself, separate from the sand. You,\r\nor your foreman, must be there, or you will not get this done. A good\r\nditcher will throw out a great mass of this loose muck and sand in a\r\nday; and you want him to dig, not think. You must do the thinking, and\r\ntell him which is muck, and which is only sand and dirt. When thrown up,\r\nthis muck, in our dry, hot climate, will, in the course of a few months,\r\npart with a large amount of water, and it can then be drawn to the barns\r\nand stables, and used for bedding, or for composting with manure. Or if\r\nyou do not want to draw it to the barn, get some refuse lime from the\r\nlime-kiln, and mix it with the muck after it has been thrown up a few\r\nweeks, and is partially dry. Turn over the heap, and put a few bushels\r\nof lime to every cord of the muck, mixing the lime and muck together,\r\nleaving the heap in a compact form, and in good shape, to shed the rain.\r\n\r\n“When you have straightened, and cleaned out, and deepened the creek,”\r\ncontinued the Doctor, “commence at _z_ on the new creek, and cut a ditch\r\nthrough the swamp to _y_. Throw the muck on one side, and the sand on\r\nthe other. This will give you some good, rich muck, and at the same time\r\ndrain your swamp. Then cut some _under-drains_ from _y_ towards the\r\nhigher land at _w_, _v_, and _h_, and from _f_ to _x_. These will drain\r\nyour land, and set free the inert plant-food, and such crops of timothy\r\nas you will get from this swamp will astonish the natives, and your bill\r\nfor medical attendance and quinine will sink to zero.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Map of Creek.]\r\n\r\nThe Doctor is right. There is money and health in the plan.\r\n\r\nProf. S. W. Johnson, as chemist to the Conn. State Ag. Society, made\r\naccurate analyses of 33 samples of peat and muck sent him by gentlemen\r\nfrom different parts of the State. The amount of potential ammonia in\r\nthe chemically dry peat was found to vary from 0.58 in the poorest, to\r\n4.06 per cent in the richest samples. In other words, one deposit of\r\nmuck may contain seven times as much nitrogen as another, and it would\r\nbe well before spending much money in drawing out muck for manure to\r\nsend a sample of it to some good chemist. A bed of swamp-muck, easily\r\naccessible, and containing 3 per cent of nitrogen, would be a mine of\r\nwealth to any farmer. One ton of such muck, dry, would contain more\r\nnitrogen than 7 tons of straw.\r\n\r\n“It would be capital stuff,” said the Deacon, “to put in your pig-pens\r\nto absorb the urine. It would make rich manure.”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” said I, “and the weak point in my pig-breeding is the want\r\nof sufficient straw. Pigs use up more bedding than any other animals.\r\nI have over 200 pigs, and I could use a ton of dry muck to each pig\r\nevery winter to great advantage. The pens would be drier, the pigs\r\nhealthier, and the manure richer.”\r\n\r\nThe Doctor here interrupted us. “I see,” said he, “that the average\r\namount of ammonia in the 33 samples of dry peat analyzed by Professor\r\nJohnson is 2.07 per cent. I had no idea that muck was so rich. Barn-yard\r\nmanure, or the manure from the horse stables in the cities, contains\r\nonly half a per cent (0.5) of ammonia, and it is an unusually rich\r\nmanure that contains one per cent. We are safe in saying that a ton of\r\ndry muck, on the average, contains at least twice as much potential\r\nammonia as the average of our best and richest stable-manure.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS POTENTIAL AMMONIA?\r\n\r\n\r\n“You say,” said the Deacon, “that dry muck contains twice as much\r\n‘_potential ammonia_’ as manure?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Doctor, “it contains three or four times as much as the\r\nhalf-rotted straw and stalks you call manure.”\r\n\r\n“But what do you mean,” asked the Deacon, “by ‘_potential_ ammonia?’”\r\n\r\n“It is a term,” said the Doctor, “we used to hear much more frequently\r\nthan we do now. Ammonia is composed of 14 lbs. of nitrogen and 3 lbs. of\r\nhydrogen; and if, on analysis, a guano or other manure was found to\r\ncontain, in whatever form, 7 per cent of nitrogen, the chemist reported\r\nthat he found in it 8½ per cent of ‘potential’ ammonia. Dried blood\r\ncontains no ammonia, but if it contained 14 per cent of nitrogen, the\r\nchemist would be justified in saying it contained 17 per cent of\r\npotential ammonia, from the fact that the dried blood, by fermentation,\r\nis capable of yielding this amount of ammonia. We say a ton of common\r\nhorse-manure contains 10 or 12 lbs. of potential ammonia. If perfectly\r\nfresh, it may not contain a particle of ammonia; but it contains\r\nnitrogen enough to produce, by fermentation, 10 or 12 lbs. of ammonia.\r\nAnd when it is said that dry swamp-muck contains, on the average, 2.07\r\nper cent of potential ammonia, it simply means that it contains nitrogen\r\nenough to produce this amount of ammonia. In point of fact, I suppose\r\nmuck, when dug fresh from the swamp, contains no ammonia. Ammonia is\r\nquite soluble in water, and if there was any ammonia in the swamp-muck,\r\nit would soon be washed out. The nitrogen, or ‘potential ammonia,’ in\r\nthe muck exists in an inert, insoluble form, and before the muck will\r\nyield up this nitrogen to plants, it is necessary, in some way, to\r\nferment or decompose it. But this is a point we will discuss at a future\r\nmeeting.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTILLAGE IS MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doctor has been invited to deliver a lecture on manure before our\r\nlocal Farmers’ Club. “The etymological meaning of the word manure,” he\r\nsaid, “is _hand labor_, from _main_, hand, and _ouvrer_, to work. To\r\nmanure the land originally meant to cultivate it, to hoe, to dig, to\r\nplow, to harrow, or stir it in any way so as to expose its particles to\r\nthe oxygen of the atmosphere, and thus render its latent elements\r\nassimilable by plants.\r\n\r\n“When our first parent,” he continued, “was sent forth from the Garden\r\nof Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken, he probably did not\r\nknow that the means necessary to kill the thorns and thistles enhanced\r\nthe productiveness of the soil, yet such was undoubtedly the case.\r\n\r\n“The farmer for centuries was simply a ‘tiller of the ground.’ Guano,\r\nthough formed, according to some eminent authorities, long ages before\r\nthe creation of man, was not then known. The coprolites lay undisturbed\r\nin countless numbers in the lias, the greensand, and the Suffolk crag.\r\nCharleston phosphates were unknown. Superphosphate, sulphate of ammonia,\r\nnitrate of soda, and kainit were not dreamed of. Nothing was said about\r\nthe mineral manure theory, or the exhaustion of the soil. There were no\r\nfrauds in artificial fertilizers; no Experiment Stations. The earth,\r\nfresh from the hands of its Creator, needed only to be ‘tickled with a\r\nhoe to laugh with a harvest.’ Nothing was said about the value of the\r\nmanure obtained from the consumption of a ton of oil-cake, or\r\nmalt-combs, or bran, or clover-hay. For many centuries, the hoe, the\r\nspade, and the rake constituted Adam’s whole stock in trade.\r\n\r\n“At length,” continued the Doctor, “a great discovery was made. A Roman\r\nfarmer--probably a prominent Granger--stumbled on a mighty truth.\r\nManuring the land--that is, hoeing and cultivating it--increased its\r\nfertility. This was well known--had been known for ages, and acted upon;\r\nbut this Roman farmer, Stercutius, who was a close observer, discovered\r\nthat the _droppings of animals_ had the same effect as hoeing. No wonder\r\nthese idolatrous people voted him a god. They thought there would be no\r\nmore old-fashioned manuring; no more hoeing.\r\n\r\n“Of course they were mistaken,” continued the Doctor, “our arable land\r\nwill always need plowing and cultivating to kill weeds. Manure, in the\r\nsense in which we now use the term, is only a partial substitute for\r\ntillage, and tillage is only a partial substitute for manure; but it is\r\nwell to bear in mind that the words mean the same thing, and the effects\r\nof both are, to a certain extent, identical. Tillage is manure, and\r\nmanure is tillage.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSUMMER-FALLOWING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to discuss the merits, or demerits, of fallowing.\r\nBut an intelligent Ohio farmer writes me: --“I see that you recommend\r\nfallow plowing, what are your reasons? Granting that the _immediate_\r\nresult is an increased crop, is not the land impoverished? Will not the\r\nthorough cultivation of corn, or potatoes, answer as well?” And a\r\ndistinguished farmer, of this State, in a recent communication expressed\r\nthe same idea--that summer-fallowing would soon impoverish the land. But\r\nif this is the case, the fault is not in the practice of\r\nsummer-fallowing, but in growing too many grain crops, and selling them,\r\ninstead of consuming them on the farm. Take two fields; summer-fallow\r\none, and sow it to wheat. Plant the other to corn, and sow wheat after\r\nit in the fall. You get, say 35 bushels of wheat per acre from the\r\nsummer-fallow. From the other field you get, say, 30 bushels of shelled\r\ncorn per acre, and 10 bushels of wheat afterwards. Now, where a farmer\r\nis in the habit of selling all his wheat, and consuming all his corn on\r\nthe farm, it is evident that the practice of summer-fallowing will\r\nimpoverish the soil more rapidly than the system of growing corn\r\nfollowed by wheat--and for the simple reason that more wheat is sold\r\nfrom the farm. If no more grain is sold in one case than in the other,\r\nthe summer-fallowing will not impoverish the soil any more than corn\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\nMy idea of fallowing is this:--The soil and the atmosphere furnish, on\r\ngood, well cultivated land, plant-food sufficient, say, for 15 bushels\r\nof wheat per acre, _every year_. It will be sometimes more, and\r\nsometimes less, according to the season and the character of the soil,\r\nbut on good, strong limestone land this may be taken as about the\r\naverage. To grow wheat every year in crops of 15 bushels per acre, would\r\nimpoverish the soil just as much as to summer-fallow and get 30 bushels\r\nof wheat every other year. It is the same thing in either case. But in\r\nsummer-fallowing, we clean the land, and the _profits_ from a crop of 30\r\nbushels per acre every other year, are much more than from two crops of\r\n15 bushels every year. You know that Mr. Lawes has a field of about\r\nthirteen acres that he sows with wheat every year. On the plot that\r\nreceives no manure of any kind, the crop, for twenty years, averaged 16¼\r\nbushels per acre. It is plowed twice every year, and the wheat is\r\nhand-hoed in the spring to keep it clean. A few years ago, in a field\r\nadjoining this experimental wheat field, and that is of the same\r\ncharacter of land, he made the following experiment. The land, after\r\nwheat, was fallowed, and then sown to wheat; then fallowed the next\r\nyear, and again sown to wheat, and the next year it was sown to wheat\r\nafter wheat. The following is the result compared with the yield of the\r\ncontinuously unmanured plot in the experimental field that is sown to\r\nwheat every year:\r\n\r\n  1. Year--No. 1--Fallow                                     No crop.\r\n           No. 2--Wheat after wheat     15 bushels 3½ pecks per acre.\r\n  2. Year--No. 1--Wheat after fallow    37    ”     --     ”       ”\r\n           No. 2--Wheat after wheat     13    ”    3¼      ”       ”\r\n  3. Year--No. 1--Fallow after wheat                         No crop.\r\n           No. 2--Wheat after wheat     15 bushels 3¼ pecks per acre.\r\n  4. Year--No. 1--Wheat after fallow    42    ”     --     ”       ”\r\n           No. 2--Wheat after wheat     21    ”    0¼      ”       ”\r\n  5. Year--No. 1--Wheat after wheat     17    ”    1¼      ”       ”\r\n           No. 2--Wheat after wheat     17    ”     --     ”       ”\r\n\r\nTaking the first four years, we have a total yield from the plot sown\r\nevery year of 66 bushels 2¼ pecks, and from the two crops alternately\r\nfallowed, a total yield of 79 bushels. The next year, when wheat was\r\nsown after wheat on the land previously fallowed, the yield was almost\r\nidentical with the yield from the plot that has grown wheat after wheat\r\nfor so many years.\r\n\r\nSo far, these results do not indicate any exhaustion from the practice\r\nof fallowing. On the other hand, they tend to show that we can get\r\n_more_ wheat by sowing it every other year, than by cropping it every\r\nyear in succession. The reason for this may be found in the fact that in\r\na fallow the land is more frequently exposed to the atmosphere by\r\nrepeated plowings and harrowings; and it should be borne in mind that\r\nthe effect of stirring the land is not necessarily in proportion to the\r\ntotal amount of stirring, but is according to the number of times that\r\nfresh particles of soil are exposed to the atmosphere. Two plowings and\r\ntwo harrowings in one week, will not do as much good as two plowings and\r\ntwo harrowings, at different times in the course of three or four\r\nmonths. It is for this reason that I object, theoretically, to sowing\r\nwheat after barley. We often plow the barley stubble twice, and spend\r\nconsiderable labor in getting the land into good condition; but it is\r\ngenerally all done in the course of ten days or two weeks. We do not get\r\nany adequate benefit for this labor. We can kill weeds readily at this\r\nseason, (August), but the stirring of the soil does not develope the\r\nlatent plant-food to the extent it would if the work was not necessarily\r\ndone in such a limited period. I say _theoretically_, for in point of\r\nfact I _do_ sow wheat after barley. I do so because it is very\r\nconvenient, and because it is more immediately profitable. I am\r\nsatisfied, however, that _in the end_ it would be more profitable to\r\nseed down the barley with clover.\r\n\r\nWe _must_ raise larger crops; and to do this we must raise them less\r\nfrequently. This is the key-note of the coming improved system of\r\nAmerican agriculture, in all sections where good land is worth less than\r\none hundred dollars per acre. In the neighborhood of large cities, and\r\nwherever land commands a high price, we must keep our farms in a high\r\nstate of fertility by the purchase of manures or cattle foods. Those of\r\nus in the interior, where we can not buy manure, must raise fewer grain\r\ncrops, and more clover. We must aim to raise 40 bushels of wheat, 50\r\nbushels of barley, 80 bushels of oats, and 100 bushels of shelled corn,\r\nand 5 bushels of clover-seed per acre. That this can be done on good,\r\nwell-drained land, from the unaided resources of the farm, I have no\r\ndoubt. It may give us no more grain to sell than at present, but it will\r\nenable us to produce much more mutton, wool, beef, cheese, butter, and\r\npork, than at present.\r\n\r\n“But, then, will there be a demand for the meat, wool, etc.?” The\r\npresent indications are highly favorable. But we must aim to raise\r\n_good_ meat. The low-priced beef and mutton sold in our markets are as\r\nunprofitable to the consumer as they are to the producer. We must feed\r\nhigher, and to do this to advantage we must have improved stock. There\r\nis no profit in farming without good tillage, larger crops, improved\r\nstock, and higher feeding. The details will be modified by\r\ncircumstances, but the principles are the same wherever agri-_culture_\r\nis practised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nHOW TO RESTORE A WORN-OUT FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have never yet seen a “worn-out” or “exhausted farm.” I know many\r\nfarms that are “run down.” I bought just such a farm a dozen or more\r\nyears ago, and I have been trying hard, ever since, to bring it up to a\r\nprofitable standard of productiveness--and am still trying, and expect\r\nto have to keep on trying so long as I keep on farming. The truth is,\r\nthere never was a farm so rich, that the farmer did not wish it was\r\nricher.\r\n\r\nI have succeeded in making the larger part of my farm much more\r\nproductive than it ever was before, since it was cleared from the\r\noriginal forest. But it is far from being as rich as I want it. The\r\ntruth is, God sent us into this world to work, and He has given us\r\nplenty to do, if we will only do it. At any rate, this is true of\r\nfarming. He has not given us land ready to our hand. The man who first\r\ncleared up my farm, had no easy task. He fairly earned all the good\r\ncrops he ever got from it. I have never begrudged him one particle of\r\nthe “natural manure” he took out of the land, in the form of wheat,\r\ncorn, oats, and hay. On the dry, sandy knolls, he probably got out a\r\ngood portion of this natural manure, but on the wetter and heavier\r\nportions of the farm, he probably did not get out one-hundredth part of\r\nthe natural manure which the land contained.\r\n\r\nNow, when such a farm came into my possession, what was I to do with it?\r\n\r\n“Tell us what you did,” said the Doctor, “and then, perhaps, we can tell\r\nyou what you ought to have done, and what you ought to have left\r\nundone.”\r\n\r\n“I made many mistakes.”\r\n\r\n“Amen,” said the Deacon; “I am glad to hear you acknowledge it.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Doctor, “it is better to make mistakes in trying to do\r\nsomething, than to hug our self-esteem, and fold our hands in indolence.\r\nIt has been said that critics are men who have failed in their\r\nundertakings. But I rather think the most disagreeable, and\r\nself-satisfied critics, are men who have never done anything, or tried\r\nto do anything, themselves.”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon, who, though something of an old fogy, is a good deal of a\r\nman, and possessed of good common sense, and much experience, took these\r\nremarks kindly. “Well,” said he to me, “I must say that your farm has\r\ncertainly improved, but you did things so differently from what we\r\nexpected, that we could not see what you were driving at.”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you what I have been aiming at all along. 1st. To drain the\r\nwet portions of the arable land. 2d. To kill weeds, and make the soil\r\nmellow and clean. 3d. To make more manure.”\r\n\r\n“You have also bought some bone-dust, superphosphate, and other\r\nartificial manures.”\r\n\r\n“True; and if I had had more money I would have bought more manure. It\r\nwould have paid well. I could have made my land as rich as it is now in\r\nhalf the time.”\r\n\r\nI had to depend principally on the natural resources of the land. I got\r\nout of the soil all I could, and kept as much of it as possible on the\r\nfarm. One of the mistakes I made was, in breaking up too much land, and\r\nputting in too much wheat, barley, oats, peas, and corn. It would have\r\nbeen better for my pocket, though possibly not so good for the farm, if\r\nI had left more of the land in grass, and also, if I had summer-fallowed\r\nmore, and sown less barley and oats, and planted less corn.\r\n\r\n“I do not see how plowing up the grass land,” said the Deacon, “could\r\npossibly be any better for the farm. You agricultural writers are always\r\ntelling us that we plow too much land, and do not raise grass and clover\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\n“What I meant by saying that it would have been better for my pocket,\r\nthough possibly not so good for the farm, if I had not plowed so much\r\nland, may need explanation. The land had been only half cultivated, and\r\nwas very foul. The grass and clover fields did not give more than half a\r\ncrop of hay, and the hay was poor in quality, and much of it half\r\nthistles, and other weeds. I plowed this land, planted it to corn, and\r\ncultivated it thoroughly. But the labor of keeping the corn clean was\r\ncostly, and absorbed a very large slice of the profits. _But_ the corn\r\nyielded a far larger produce per acre than I should have got had the\r\nland lain in grass. And as all this produce was consumed on the farm, we\r\nmade more manure than if we had plowed less land.”\r\n\r\nI have great faith in the benefits of thorough tillage--or, in other\r\nwords, of breaking up, pulverizing, and exposing the soil to the\r\ndecomposing action of the atmosphere. I look upon a good, strong soil\r\nas a kind of storehouse of plant-food. But it is not an easy matter to\r\nrender this plant-food soluble. If it were any less soluble than it is,\r\nit would have all leached out of the land centuries ago. Turning over,\r\nand fining a manure-heap, if other conditions are favorable, cause rapid\r\nfermentation with the formation of carbonate of ammonia, and other\r\nsoluble salts. Many of our soils, to the depth of eight or ten inches,\r\ncontain enough nitrogenous matter in an acre to produce two or three\r\nthousand pounds of ammonia. By stirring the soil, and exposing it to the\r\natmosphere, a small portion of this nitrogen becomes annually available,\r\nand is taken up by the growing crops. And it is so with the other\r\nelements of plant-food. Stirring the soil, then, is the basis of\r\nagriculture. It has been said that we must return to the soil as much\r\nplant-food as we take from it. If this were true, nothing could be sold\r\nfrom the farm. What we should aim to do, is to develop as much as\r\npossible of the plant-food that lies latent in the soil, and not to sell\r\nin the form of crops, cheese, wool, or animals, any more of this\r\nplant-food than we annually develop from the soil. In this way the\r\n“condition” of the soil would remain the same. If we sell _less_ than we\r\ndevelop, the condition of the soil will improve.\r\n\r\nBy “condition,” I mean the amount of _available_ plant-food in the soil.\r\nNearly all our farms are poorer in plant-food to-day than when first\r\ncleared of the original forest, or than they were ten, fifteen, or\r\ntwenty years later. In other words, the plants and animals that have\r\nbeen sold from the farm, have carried off a considerable amount of\r\nplant-food. We have taken far more nitrogen, phosphoric acid, potash,\r\netc., out of the soil, than we have returned to it in the shape of\r\nmanure. Consequently, the soil must contain less and less of plant-food\r\nevery year. And yet, while this is a self-evident fact, it is,\r\nnevertheless, true that many of these self-same farms are more\r\nproductive now than when first cleared, or at any rate more productive\r\nthan they were twenty-five or thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nSometime ago, the Deacon and I visited the farm of Mr. Dewey, of Monroe\r\nCo., N.Y. He is a good farmer. He does not practice “high farming” in\r\nthe sense in which I use that term. His is a good example of what I term\r\nslow farming. He raises large crops, but comparatively few of them. On\r\nhis farm of 300 acres, he raises 40 acres of wheat, 17 acres of Indian\r\ncorn, and 23 acres of oats, barley, potatoes, roots, etc. In other\r\nwords, he has 80 acres in crops, and 220 acres in grass--not permanent\r\ngrass. He lets it lie in grass five, six, seven, or eight years, as he\r\ndeems best, and then breaks it up, and plants it to corn. The land he\r\nintends to plant to corn next year, has been in grass for seven years.\r\nHe will put pretty much all his manure on this land. After corn, it will\r\nbe sown to oats, or barley; then sown to wheat, and seeded down again.\r\nIt will then lie in grass three, four, five, six, or seven years, until\r\nhe needs it again for corn, etc. This is “slow farming,” but it is also\r\ngood farming--that is to say, it gives large yields per acre, and a good\r\nreturn for the labor expended.\r\n\r\nThe soil of this farm is richer to-day in _available_ plant-food than\r\nwhen first cleared. It produces larger crops per acre.\r\n\r\nMr. D. called our attention to a fact that establishes this point. An\r\nold fence that had occupied the ground for many years was removed some\r\nyears since, and the two fields thrown into one. Every time this field\r\nis in crops, it is easy to see where the old fence was, by the short\r\nstraw and poor growth on this strip, as compared with the land on each\r\nside which had been cultivated for years.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the result that I should have expected. If Mr. D. was\r\na poor farmer--if he cropped his land frequently, did not more than\r\nhalf-cultivate it, sold everything he raised, and drew back no manure--I\r\nthink the old fence-strip would have given the best crops.\r\n\r\nThe strip of land on which the old fence stood in Mr. Dewey’s field,\r\ncontained _more_ plant-food than the soil on either side of it. But it\r\nwas not available. It was not developed. It was latent, inert,\r\ninsoluble, crude, and undecomposed. It was so much dead capital. The\r\nland on either side which had been cultivated for years, produced better\r\ncrops. Why? Simply because the stirring of the soil had developed _more_\r\nplant-food than had been removed by the crops. If the stirring of the\r\nsoil developed 100 lbs. of plant-food a year, and only 75 lbs. were\r\ncarried off in the crops--25 lbs. being left on the land in the form of\r\nroots, stubble, etc.--the land, at the expiration of 40 years, would\r\ncontain, provided none of it was lost, 1,000 lbs. more _available_\r\nplant-food than the uncultivated strip. On the other hand, the latter\r\nwould contain 3,000 lbs. more actual plant-food per acre than the land\r\nwhich had been cultivated--but it is in an unavailable condition. It is\r\ndead capital.\r\n\r\nI do not know that I make myself understood, though I would like to do\r\nso, because I am sure there is no point in scientific farming of greater\r\nimportance. Mr. Geddes calls grass the “pivotal crop” of American\r\nagriculture. He deserves our thanks for the word and the idea connected\r\nwith it. But I am inclined to think the _pivot_ on which our agriculture\r\nstands and rotates, lies deeper than this. The grass crop creates\r\nnothing--developes nothing. The untilled and unmanured grass lands of\r\nHerkimer County, in this State, are no richer to-day than they were 50\r\nyears ago. The pastures of Cheshire, England, except those that have\r\nbeen top-dressed with bones, or other manures, are no more productive\r\nthan they were centuries back. Grass alone will not make rich land. It\r\nis a good “savings bank.” It gathers up and saves plant-food from\r\nrunning to waste. It pays a good interest, and is a capital institution.\r\nBut the real source of fertility must be looked for _in the stores of\r\nplant-food lying dormant in the soil_. Tillage, underdraining, and\r\nthorough cultivation, are the means by which we develop and render this\r\nplant-food available. Grass, clover, peas, or any other crop consumed on\r\nthe farm, merely affords us the means of saving this plant-food and\r\nmaking it pay a good interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we have the necessary materials, it is not a difficult matter to make\r\nmanure; in fact, the manure will make itself. We sometimes need to\r\nhasten the process, and to see that none of the fertilizing matter runs\r\nto waste. This is about all that we can do. We cannot create an atom of\r\nplant-food. It is ready formed to our hands; but we must know where to\r\nlook for it, and how to get it in the easiest, cheapest, and best way,\r\nand how to save and use it. The science of manure-making is a profound\r\nstudy. It is intimately connected with nearly every branch of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nIf weeds grow and decay on the land, they make manure. If we grow a crop\r\nof buckwheat, or spurry, or mustard, or rape, or clover, and mow it, and\r\nlet it lie on the land, it makes manure; or if we plow it under, it\r\nforms manure; or if, after it is mown, we rake up the green crop, and\r\nput it into a heap, it will ferment, heat will be produced by the slow\r\ncombustion of a portion of the carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter, and\r\nthe result will be a mass of material, which we should all recognize as\r\n“manure.” If, instead of putting the crop into a heap and letting it\r\nferment, we feed it to animals, the digestible carbonaceous and\r\nnitrogenous matter will be consumed to produce animal heat and to\r\nsustain the vital functions, and the refuse, or the solid and liquid\r\ndroppings of the animals, will be manure.\r\n\r\nIf the crop rots on the ground, nothing is added to it. If it ferments,\r\nand gives out heat, in a heap, nothing is added to it. If it is passed\r\nthrough an animal, and produces heat, nothing is added to it.\r\n\r\nI have heard people say a farmer could not make manure unless he kept\r\nanimals. We might with as much truth say a farmer cannot make ashes\r\nunless he keeps stoves; and it would be just as sensible to take a lot\r\nof stoves into the woods to make ashes, as it is to keep a lot of\r\nanimals merely to make manure. You can make the ashes by throwing the\r\nwood into a pile, and burning it; and you can make the manure by\r\nthrowing the material out of which the manure is to be made into a pile,\r\nand letting it ferment. On a farm where neither food nor manure of any\r\nkind is purchased, the only way to make manure is to _get it out of the\r\nland_.\r\n\r\n“From the land and from the atmosphere,” remarked the Doctor. “Plants\r\nget a large portion of the material of which they are composed from the\r\natmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, “but it is principally carbonaceous matter, which is\r\nof little or no value as manure. A small amount of ammonia and nitric\r\nacid are also brought to the soil by rains and dews, and a\r\nfreshly-stirred soil may also sometimes absorb more or less ammonia from\r\nthe atmosphere; but while this is true, so far as making manure is\r\nconcerned, we must look to the plant-food existing in the soil itself.\r\n\r\n“Take such a farm as Mr. Dewey’s, that we have already referred to. No\r\nmanure or food has been purchased; or at any rate, not one-tenth as much\r\nas has been sold, and yet the farm is more productive to-day than when\r\nit was first cleared of the forest. He has developed the manure from the\r\nstores of latent plant-food previously existing in the soil and this is\r\nthe way farmers generally make manure.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF MANURE DEPENDS ON THE FOOD--NOT ON THE ANIMAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n“If,” said I, “you should put a ton of cut straw in a heap, wet it, and\r\nlet it rot down into manure; and should place in another heap a ton of\r\ncut corn-fodder, and in another heap a ton of cut clover-hay, wet them,\r\nand let them also rot down into manure; and in another heap a ton of\r\npulped-turnips, and in another heap a ton of corn-meal, and in another\r\nheap a ton of bran, and in another a ton of malt-sprouts, and let them\r\nbe mixed with water, and so treated that they will ferment without loss\r\nof ammonia or other valuable plant-food, I think no one will say that\r\nall these different heaps of manure will have the same value. And if\r\nnot, why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Charley, “the ton of straw does not contain as much\r\nvaluable plant-food as the ton of corn-fodder, nor the ton of\r\ncorn-fodder as much as the ton of clover-hay.”\r\n\r\n“Now then,” said I, “instead of putting a ton of straw in one heap to\r\nrot, and a ton of corn-fodder in another heap, and a ton of clover in\r\nanother heap, we feed the ton of straw to a cow, and the ton of\r\ncorn-fodder to another cow, and the ton of clover to another cow, and\r\nsave _all_ the solid and liquid excrements, will the manure made from\r\nthe ton of straw be worth as much as the manure made from the ton of\r\ncorn-fodder or clover-hay?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Charley. --“Certainly not,” said the Doctor. --“I am not so\r\nsure about it,” said the Deacon; “I think you will get more manure from\r\nthe corn-fodder than from the straw or clover-hay.”\r\n\r\n“We are not talking about bulk,” said the Doctor, “but value.” “Suppose,\r\nDeacon,” said he, “you were to shut up a lot of your Brahma hens, and\r\nfeed them a ton of corn-meal, and should also feed a ton of corn-meal\r\nmade into slops to a lot of pigs, and should save _all_ the liquid and\r\nsolid excrements from the pigs, and all the manure from the hens, which\r\nwould be worth the most?” --“The hen-manure, of course,” said the\r\nDeacon, who has great faith in this kind of “guano,” as he calls it.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said the Doctor, “you would probably not get more than half a\r\nton of manure from the hens, while the liquid and solid excrements from\r\nthe pigs, if the corn-meal was made into a thin slop, would weigh two or\r\nthree tons.”\r\n\r\n“More, too,” said the Deacon, “the way you feed your store pigs.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; and yet you say that the half ton of hen-manure made from a\r\nton of corn is worth more than the two or three tons of pig-manure made\r\nfrom a ton of corn. You do not seem to think, after all, that mere bulk\r\nor weight adds anything to the value of the manure. Why then should you\r\nsay that the manure from a ton of corn-fodder is worth more than from a\r\nton of straw, because it is more bulky?”\r\n\r\n“You, yourself,” said the Deacon, “also say the manure from the ton of\r\ncorn-fodder is worth more than from the ton of straw.” --“True,” said I\r\n“but _not_ because it is more bulky. It is worth more because the ton of\r\ncorn-fodder contains a greater quantity of valuable plant-food than the\r\nton of straw. The clover is still richer in this valuable plant-food,\r\nand the manure is much more valuable; in fact, the manure from the ton\r\nof clover is worth as much as the manure from the ton of straw and the\r\nton of corn-fodder together.”\r\n\r\n“I would like to see you prove that,” said the Deacon, “for if it is\r\ntrue, I will sell no more clover-hay. I can’t get as much for clover-hay\r\nin the market as I can for rye-straw.”\r\n\r\n“I will not attempt to _prove_ it at present,” said the Doctor; “but the\r\nevidence is so strong and so conclusive that no rational man, who will\r\nstudy the subject, can fail to be thoroughly convinced of its truth.”\r\n\r\n“The value of manure,” said I, “does not depend on the quantity of water\r\nwhich it contains, or on the quantity of sand, or silica, or on the\r\namount of woody fibre or carbonaceous matter. These things add little or\r\nnothing to its fertilizing value, except in rare cases; and the\r\nsulphuric acid and lime are worth no more than the same quantity of\r\nsulphate of lime or gypsum, and the chlorine and soda are probably worth\r\nno more than so much common salt. The real chemical value of the manure,\r\nother things being equal, is in proportion to the nitrogen, phosphoric\r\nacid, and potash, that the manure contains.\r\n\r\n“And the quantity of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash found in the\r\nmanure is determined, other things being equal, by the quantity of the\r\nnitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash contained in the food consumed by\r\nthe animals making the manure.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nFOODS WHICH MAKE RICH MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, contained in\r\ndifferent foods, has been accurately determined by many able and\r\nreliable chemists.\r\n\r\nThe following table was prepared by Dr. J. B. Lawes, of Rothamsted,\r\nEngland, and was first published in this country in the “Genesee\r\nFarmer,” for May, 1860. Since then, it has been repeatedly published in\r\nnearly all the leading agricultural journals of the world, and has given\r\nrise to much discussion. The following is the table, with some recent\r\nadditions:\r\n\r\n  TD: Total dry matter.\r\n  TM: Total mineral matter (ash).\r\n  Ph: Phosphoric acid reckoned as phosphate of lime.\r\n  P:  Potash.\r\n  N:  Nitrogen.\r\n  V:  Value of manure in dollars and cents from 1 ton (2,000 lbs.)\r\n      of food.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+----------------------------------+-------\r\n                         |             Per Cent.            |\r\n                         +------+------+------+------+------+\r\n                         | TD   | TM   | Ph   |  P   |  N   |   V\r\n  -----------------------+------+------+------+------+------+-------\r\n   1.

Twenty-five to thirty years ago, rape-cake, ground\r\nas fine as corn-meal, was used quite extensively on many of the\r\nlight-land farms of England as a manure for turnips, and not\r\nunfrequently as a manure for wheat. Mr. Lawes used it for many years in\r\nhis experiments on turnips and on wheat.\r\n\r\nOf late years, however, it has been fed to sheep and cattle. In other\r\nwords, it has been used, not as formerly, for manure alone, but for food\r\nfirst, and manure afterwards. The oil and other carbonaceous matter\r\nwhich the cake contains is of little value for manure, while it is of\r\ngreat value as food. The animals take out this carbonaceous matter, and\r\nleave nearly all the nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash in the\r\nmanure. Farmers who had found it profitable to use on wheat and turnips\r\nfor manure alone, found it still more profitable to use it first for\r\nfood, and then for manure afterwards. Mr. Lawes, it will be seen,\r\nestimates the manure produced from the consumption of a ton of rape-cake\r\nat $21.01.\r\n\r\nLinseed-oil cake comes next. Pure linseed-cake is exceedingly valuable,\r\nboth for food and manure. It is a favorite food with all cattle and\r\nsheep breeders and feeders. It has a wonderful effect in improving the\r\nappearance of cattle and sheep. An English farmer thinks he cannot get\r\nalong without “cake” for his calves, lambs, cattle, and sheep. In this\r\ncountry, it is not so extensively used, except by the breeders of\r\nimproved stock. It is so popular in England that the price is fully up\r\nto its intrinsic value, and not unfrequently other foods, in proportion\r\nto the nutritive and manurial value, can be bought cheaper. This fact\r\nshows the value of a good reputation. Linseed-cake, however, is often\r\nadulterated, and farmers need to be cautious who they deal with. When\r\npure, it will be seen that the manure made by the consumption of a ton\r\nof linseed-cake is worth $19.72.\r\n\r\nMalt-dust stands next on the list. This article is known by different\r\nnames. In England, it is often called “malt-combs;” here it is known as\r\n“malt-_sprouts_,” or “malt-_roots_.” In making barley into malt, the\r\nbarley is soaked in water, and afterwards kept in a warm room until it\r\ngerminates, and throws out sprouts and roots. It is then dried, and\r\nbefore the malt is used, these dried sprouts and roots are sifted out,\r\nand are sold for cattle-food. They weigh from 22 to 25 lbs. per bushel\r\nof 40 quarts. They are frequently mixed at the breweries with the\r\n“grains,” and are sold to milkmen at the same price--from 12 to 15 cents\r\nper bushel. Where their value is not known, they can, doubtless, be\r\nsometimes obtained at a mere nominal price. Milkmen, I believe, prefer\r\nthe “grains” to the malt-dust. The latter, however, is a good food for\r\nsheep. It has one advantage over brewer’s “grains.” The latter contain\r\n76 per cent of water, while the malt-dust contains only 6 per cent of\r\nwater. We can afford, therefore, to transport malt-dust to a greater\r\ndistance than the grains. We do not want to carry _water_ many miles.\r\nThere is another advantage: brewer’s grains soon ferment, and become\r\nsour; while the malt-dust, being dry, will keep for any length of time.\r\nIt will be seen that Mr. Lawes estimates the value of the manure left\r\nfrom the consumption of a ton of malt-dust at $18.21.\r\n\r\nTares or vetches, lentils, linseed or flaxseed, beans, wheat, bran,\r\nmiddlings, fine mill-feed, undecorticated cotton-seed cake, peas, and\r\ncotton-seed, stand next on the list. The value of these for manure\r\nranging from $13.25 to $16.75 per ton.\r\n\r\nThen comes clover-hay. Mr. Lawes estimates the value of the manure from\r\nthe consumption of a ton of clover-hay at $9.64. This is from early cut\r\nclover-hay.\r\n\r\nWhen clover is allowed to grow until it is nearly out of flower, the hay\r\nwould not contain so much nitrogen, and would not be worth quite so much\r\nper ton for manure. When mixed with timothy or other grasses, or with\r\nweeds, it would not be so valuable. The above estimate is for the\r\naverage quality of good pure English clover-hay. Our best farmers raise\r\nclover equally as good; but I have seen much clover-hay that certainly\r\nwould not come up to this standard. Still, even our common clover-hay\r\nmakes rich manure. In Wolff’s Table, given in the appendix, it will be\r\nseen that clover-hay contains only 1.97 per cent of nitrogen and 5.7 per\r\ncent of ash. Mr. Lawes’ clover contains more nitrogen and ash. This\r\nmeans richer land and a less mature condition of the crop.\r\n\r\nThe cereal grains, wheat, barley, oats, and Indian corn, stand next on\r\nthe list, being worth from $6.32 to $7.70 per ton for manure.\r\n\r\n“Meadow-hay,” which in the table is estimated as worth $6.43 per ton for\r\nmanure, is the hay from permanent meadows. It is a quite different\r\narticle from the “English Meadow-hay” of New England. It is, in fact,\r\nthe perfection of hay. The meadows are frequently top-dressed with\r\ncomposted manure or artificial fertilizers, and the hay is composed of a\r\nnumber of the best grasses, cut early and carefully cured. It will be\r\nnoticed, however, that even this choice meadow-hay is not as valuable\r\nfor manure as clover-hay.\r\n\r\nEnglish bean-straw is estimated as worth $3.87 per ton for manure. The\r\nEnglish “horse bean,” which is the kind here alluded to, has a very\r\nstiff, coarse long straw, and looks as though it was much inferior as\r\nfodder, to the straw of our ordinary white beans. See Wolff’s table in\r\nthe appendix.\r\n\r\nPea-straw is estimated at $3.74 per ton. When the peas are not allowed\r\nto grow until dead ripe, and when the straw is carefully cured, it makes\r\ncapital food for sheep. Taking the grain and straw together, it will be\r\nseen that peas are an unusually valuable crop to grow for the purpose of\r\nmaking rich manure.\r\n\r\nThe straw of oats, wheat, and barley, is worth from $2.25 to $2.90 per\r\nton. Barley straw being the poorest for manure, and oat straw the\r\nrichest.\r\n\r\nPotatoes are worth $1.50 per ton, or nearly 5 cents a bushel for manure.\r\n\r\nThe manurial value of roots varies from 80 cents a ton for carrots, to\r\n$1.07 for mangel-wurzel, and $1.14 for parsnips.\r\n\r\nI am very anxious that there should be no misapprehension as to the\r\nmeaning of these figures. I am sure they are well worth the careful\r\nstudy of every intelligent farmer. Mr. Lawes has been engaged in making\r\nexperiments for over thirty years. There is no man more competent to\r\nspeak with authority on such a subject. The figures showing the money\r\nvalue of the manure made from the different foods, are based on the\r\namount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, which they contain. Mr.\r\nLawes has been buying and using artificial manures for many years, and\r\nis quite competent to form a correct conclusion as to the cheapest\r\nsources of obtaining nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. He has\r\ncertainly not overestimated their _cost_. They can not be bought at\r\nlower rates, either in England or America. But of course it does not\r\nfollow from this that these manures are worth to the farmer the price\r\ncharged for them; that is a matter depending on many conditions. All\r\nthat can be said is, that if you are going to buy commercial manures,\r\nyou will have to pay at least as much for the nitrogen, phosphoric acid,\r\nand potash, as the price fixed upon by Mr. Lawes. And you should\r\nrecollect that there are other ingredients in the manure obtained from\r\nthe food of animals, which are not estimated as of any value in the\r\ntable. For instance, there is a large amount of carbonaceous matter in\r\nthe manure of animals, which, for some crops, is not without value, but\r\nwhich is not here taken into account.\r\n\r\nViewed from a farmer’s stand-point, the table of money values must be\r\ntaken only in a comparative sense. It is not claimed that the manure\r\nfrom a ton of wheat-straw is worth $2.68. This may, or may not, be the\r\ncase. But _if_ the manure from a ton of wheat-straw is worth $2.08,\r\n_then_ the manure from a ton of pea-straw is worth $3.74, and the manure\r\nfrom a ton of corn-meal is worth $6.65, and the manure from a ton of\r\nclover-hay is worth $9.64, and the manure from a ton of wheat-bran is\r\nworth $14.59. _If_ the manure from a ton of corn meal is _not_ worth\r\n$6.65, then the manure from a ton of bran is not worth $14.59. If the\r\nmanure from the ton of corn is worth _more_ than $6.65, then the manure\r\nfrom a ton of bran is worth _more_ than $14.59. There need be no doubt\r\non this point.\r\n\r\nSettle in your own mind what the manure from a ton of any one of the\r\nfoods mentioned is worth on your farm, and you can easily calculate what\r\nthe manure is worth from all the others. If you say that the manure from\r\na ton of wheat-straw is worth $1.34, then the manure from a ton of\r\nIndian corn is worth $3.33, and the manure from a ton of bran is worth\r\n$7.30, and the manure from a ton of clover-hay is worth $4.82.\r\n\r\nIn this section, however, few good farmers are willing to sell straw,\r\nthough they can get from $8.00 to $10.00 per ton for it. They think it\r\nmust be consumed on the farm, or used for bedding, or their land will\r\nrun down. I do not say they are wrong, but I do say, that if a ton of\r\nstraw is worth $2.68 for manure alone, then a ton of clover-hay is worth\r\n$9.64 for manure alone. This may be accepted as a general truth, and one\r\nwhich a farmer can act upon. And so, too, in regard to the value of\r\ncorn-meal, bran, and all the other articles given in the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another point of great importance which should be mentioned in\r\nthis connection. The nitrogen in the better class of foods is worth more\r\nfor manure than the nitrogen in straw, corn-stalks, and other coarse\r\nfodder. Nearly all the nitrogen in grain, and other rich foods, is\r\ndigested by the animals, and is voided in solution in the urine. In\r\nother words, the nitrogen in the manure is in an active and available\r\ncondition. On the other hand, only about half the nitrogen in the coarse\r\nfodders and straw is digestible. The other half passes off in a crude\r\nand comparatively unavailable condition, in the solid excrement. In\r\nestimating the value of the manure from a ton of food, these facts\r\nshould be remembered.\r\n\r\nI have said that if the manure from a ton of straw is worth $2.68, the\r\nmanure from a ton of corn is worth $6.65; but I will not reverse the\r\nproposition, and say that if the manure from a ton of corn is worth\r\n$6.65, the manure from a ton of straw is worth $2.68. The manure from\r\nthe grain is nearly all in an available condition, while that from the\r\nstraw is not. A pound of nitrogen in rich manure is worth more than a\r\npound of nitrogen in poor manure. This is another reason why we should\r\ntry to make rich manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nHORSE MANURE AND FARM-YARD MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manure from horses is generally considered richer and better than\r\nthat from cows. This is not always the case, though it is probably so as\r\na rule. There are three principal reasons for this. 1st. The horse is\r\nusually fed more grain and hay than the cow. In other words, the food of\r\nthe horse is usually richer in the valuable elements of plant-food than\r\nthe ordinary food of the cow. 2d. The milk of the cow abstracts\r\nconsiderable nitrogen, phosphoric acid, etc., from the food, and to this\r\nextent there is less of these valuable substances in the excrements. 3d.\r\nThe excrements of the cow contain much more water than those of the\r\nhorse. And consequently a ton of cow-dung, other things being equal,\r\nwould not contain as much actual manure as a ton of horse-dung.\r\n\r\nBoussingault, who is eminently trustworthy, gives us the following\r\ninteresting facts:\r\n\r\nA horse consumed in 24 hours, 20 lbs. of hay, 6 lbs. of oats, and 43\r\nlbs. of water, and voided during the same period, 3 lbs. 7 ozs. of\r\nurine, and 38 lbs. 2 ozs. of solid excrements.\r\n\r\nThe solid excrements contained 23½ lbs. of water, and the urine 2 lbs. 6\r\nozs. of water.\r\n\r\nAccording to this, a horse, eating 20 lbs. of hay, and 6 lbs. of oats,\r\nper day, voids in a year nearly seven tons of solid excrements, and\r\n1,255 lbs. of urine.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that there must have been some mistake in collecting the\r\nurine, or what was probably the case, that some of it must have been\r\nabsorbed by the dung; for 3½ pints of urine per day is certainly much\r\nless than is usually voided by a horse.\r\n\r\nStockard gives the amount of urine voided by a horse in a year at 3,000\r\nlbs.; a cow, 8,000 lbs.; sheep, 380 lbs.; pig, 1,200 lbs.\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker, at the Royal Agricultural College, at Cirencester, England,\r\nmade some valuable investigations in regard to the composition of\r\nfarm-yard manure, and the changes which take place during fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe manure was composed of horse, cow, and pig-dung, mixed with the\r\nstraw used for bedding in the stalls, pig-pens, sheds, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of November, 1854, a sample of what Dr. Vœlcker calls “Fresh\r\nLong Dung,” was taken from the “manure-pit” for analysis. It had lain in\r\nthe pit or heap about 14 days.\r\n\r\nThe following is the result of the analysis:\r\n\r\n  Fresh Farm-Yard Manure.\r\n  Half A Ton, Or 1,000 Lbs.\r\n\r\n  Water                   661.7  lbs.\r\n  Organic matter          282.4   ”\r\n  Ash                      55.9   ”\r\n                        -------------\r\n                        1,000.0  lbs.\r\n  Nitrogen                  6.43  ”\r\n\r\n“Before you go any farther,” said the Deacon, “let me understand what\r\nthese figures mean? Do you mean that a ton of manure contains only 12¾\r\nlbs. of nitrogen, and 111 lbs. of ash, and that all the rest is\r\ncarbonaceous matter and water, of little or no value?” --“That is it\r\nprecisely, Deacon,” said I, “and furthermore, a large part of the ash\r\nhas very little fertilizing value, as seen from the following:\r\n\r\n  Detailed Composition of the Ash of Fresh Barn-Yard Manure.\r\n\r\n  Soluble silica                             21.59\r\n  Insoluble silicious matter (sand)          10.04\r\n  Phosphate of lime                           5.35\r\n  Oxide of iron, alumina, with phosphate      8.47\r\n  Containing phosphoric acid                  3.18\r\n  Lime                                       21.31\r\n  Magnesia                                    2.76\r\n  Potash                                     12.04\r\n  Soda                                        1.30\r\n  Chloride of sodium                          0.54\r\n  Sulphuric acid                              1.49\r\n  Carbonic acid and loss                     15.11\r\n                                            ------\r\n                                            100.00\r\n\r\nNitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, are the most valuable ingredients\r\nin manure. It will be seen that a ton of fresh barn-yard manure, of\r\nprobably good average quality, contains:\r\n\r\n  Nitrogen            12¾ lbs.\r\n  Phosphoric acid      6½  ”\r\n  Potash              13½  ”\r\n\r\nI do not say that these are the only ingredients of any value in a ton\r\nof manure. Nearly all the other ingredients are indispensable to the\r\ngrowth of plants, and if we should use manures containing nothing but\r\nnitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, the time would come when the\r\ncrops would fail, from lack of a sufficient quantity of, perhaps,\r\nmagnesia, or lime, sulphuric acid, or soluble silica, or iron. But it is\r\nnot necessary to make provision for such a contingency. It would be a\r\nvery exceptional case. Farmers who depend mainly on barn-yard manure, or\r\non plowing under green crops for keeping up the fertility of the land,\r\nmay safely calculate that the value of the manure is in proportion to\r\nthe amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, it contains.\r\n\r\nWe draw out a ton of fresh manure and spread it on the land, therefore,\r\nin order to furnish the growing crops with 12¾ lbs. of nitrogen, 6½ lbs.\r\nof phosphoric acid, and 13½ lbs. of potash. Less than 33 lbs. in all!\r\n\r\nWe cannot dispense with farm-yard manure. We can seldom buy nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, and potash, as cheaply as we can get them in home-made\r\nmanures. But we should clearly understand the fact that we draw out\r\n2,000 lbs. of matter in order to get 33 lbs. of these fertilizing\r\ningredients. We should _try to make richer manure_. A ton of manure\r\ncontaining 60 lbs. of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, costs no\r\nmore to draw out and spread, than a ton containing only 30 lbs., and it\r\nwould be worth nearly or quite double the money.\r\n\r\nHow to make richer manure we will not discuss at this time. It is a\r\nquestion of food. But it is worth while to enquire if we can not take\r\nsuch manure as we have, and reduce its weight and bulk without losing\r\nany of its nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nFERMENTING MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker placed 2,838 lbs. of fresh mixed manure in a heap Nov. 3,\r\n1854, and the next spring, April 30, it weighed 2,026 lbs., a shrinkage\r\nin weight of 28.6 per cent. In other words 100 tons of such manure would\r\nbe reduced to less than 71½ tons.\r\n\r\nThe heap was weighed again, August 23d, and contained 1,994 lbs. It was\r\nagain weighed Nov. 15, and contained 1,974 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the composition of the heap when first put up,\r\nand also at the three subsequent periods:\r\n\r\n  Table Showing Composition of the Whole Heap; Fresh Farm-Yard Manure\r\n  (No. I.)

Thus we find at the end of April\r\nvery nearly the same amount of nitrogen which is contained in the fresh;\r\nwhereas, at the end of August, 27.9 per cent of the total nitrogen, or\r\nnearly one-third of the nitrogen in the manure, has been wasted in one\r\nway or the other.\r\n\r\n“It is worthy of observation,” continues Dr. Vœlcker, “that, during a\r\nwell-regulated fermentation of dung, the loss in intrinsically valuable\r\nconstituents is inconsiderable, and that in such a preparatory process\r\nthe _efficacy of the manure becomes greatly enhanced_. For certain\r\npurposes fresh dung can never take the place of well-rotted dung. * *\r\nThe farmer will, therefore, always be compelled to submit a portion of\r\nhome-made dung to fermentation, and will find satisfaction in knowing\r\nthat this process, when well regulated, is not attended with any serious\r\ndepreciation of the value of the manure. In the foregoing analyses he\r\nwill find the direct proof that as long as heavy showers of rain are\r\nexcluded from manure-heaps, or the manure is kept in water-proof pits,\r\nthe most valuable fertilizing matters are preserved.”\r\n\r\nThis experiment of Dr. Vœlcker proves conclusively that manure can be\r\nkept in a rapid state of fermentation for six months during winter, with\r\nlittle loss of nitrogen or other fertilizing matter.\r\n\r\nDuring fermentation a portion of the insoluble matter of the dung\r\nbecomes soluble, and if the manure is then kept in a heap exposed to\r\nrain, there is a great loss of fertilizing matter. This is precisely\r\nwhat we should expect. We ferment manure to make it more readily\r\navailable as plant-food, and when we have attained our object, the\r\nmanure should be applied to the land. We keep winter apples in the\r\ncellar until they get ripe. As soon as they are ripe, they should be\r\neaten, or they will rapidly decay. This is well understood. And it\r\nshould be equally well known that manure, after it has been fermenting\r\nin a heap for six months, cannot safely be kept for another six months\r\nexposed to the weather.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the composition of 100 lbs. of the farm-yard\r\nmanure, at different periods of the year:\r\n\r\n  Composition of 100 Lbs. of Fresh Farm-Yard Manure (No. I.)

After\r\nfermenting in an exposed heap for six months, it still contains about\r\nthe same _percentage_ of water. When kept in the heap until August, the\r\npercentage of water is much greater. Of four tons of such manure, three\r\ntons are water.\r\n\r\nOf _Nitrogen_, the most valuable ingredient of the manure, the fresh\r\ndung, contained 0.64 per cent; after fermenting six months, it contained\r\n0.89 per cent. Six months later, it contained 0.65 per cent, or about\r\nthe same amount as the fresh manure.\r\n\r\nOf mineral matter, or ash, this fresh farm-yard manure contained 5.59\r\nper cent; of which 1.54 was soluble in water, and 4.05 insoluble. After\r\nfermenting in the heap for six months, the manure contained 10.55 per\r\ncent of ash, of which 2.86 was soluble, and 7.69 insoluble. Six months\r\nlater, the soluble ash had decreased to 1.97 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the composition of the manure, at different\r\nperiods, in the _dry state_. In other words, supposing all the water to\r\nbe removed from the manure, its composition would be as follows:\r\n\r\n  Composition of Fresh Farm-Yard Manure (No. I.)

It will be perceived that the proportion of organic matter steadily\r\ndiminishes from month to month, until the original percentage of organic\r\nmatter in the dry manure, amounting to 83.48 per cent, becomes reduced\r\nto 53 per cent.\r\n\r\n“2. On the other hand, the total percentage of mineral matter rises as\r\nsteadily as that of the organic matter falls.\r\n\r\n“3. It will be seen that the loss in organic matter affects the\r\npercentage of insoluble organic matters more than the percentage of\r\nsoluble organic substances.\r\n\r\n“4. The percentage of soluble organic matters, indeed, increased\r\nconsiderably during the first experimental period; it rose, namely, from\r\n7.33 per cent to 12.79 per cent. Examined again on the 30th of April,\r\nvery nearly the same percentage of soluble organic matter, as on\r\nFebruary the 14th, was found. The August analysis shows but a slight\r\ndecrease in the percentage of soluble organic matters, while there is a\r\ndecrease of 2 per cent of soluble organic matters when the November\r\nanalysis is compared with the February analysis.\r\n\r\n“5. The soluble mineral matters in this manure rise or fall in the\r\ndifferent experimental periods in the same order as the soluble organic\r\nmatters. Thus, in February, 9.84 per cent of soluble mineral matters\r\nwere found, whilst the manure contained only 4.55 per cent, when put up\r\ninto a heap in November, 1854. Gradually, however, the proportion of\r\nsoluble mineral matters again diminished, and became reduced to 7.27 per\r\ncent, on the examination of the manure in November, 1855.\r\n\r\n“6. A similar regularity will be observed in the percentage of nitrogen\r\ncontained in the soluble organic matters.\r\n\r\n“7. In the insoluble organic matters, the percentage of nitrogen\r\nregularly increased from November, 1854, up to the 23d of August,\r\nnotwithstanding the rapid diminution of the percentage of insoluble\r\norganic matter. For the last experimental period, the percentage of\r\nnitrogen in the insoluble matter is nearly the same as on August 23d.\r\n\r\n“8. With respect to the total percentage of nitrogen in the fresh\r\nmanure, examined at different periods of the year, it will be seen that\r\nthe February manure contains about one-half per cent more of nitrogen\r\nthan the manure in a perfectly fresh state. On the 30th of April, the\r\npercentage of nitrogen again slightly increased; on August 23d, it\r\nremained stationary, and had sunk but very little when last examined on\r\nthe 15th of November, 1855.\r\n\r\n“This series of analyses thus shows that fresh farm-yard manure rapidly\r\nbecomes more soluble in water, but that this desirable change is\r\nrealized at the expense of a large proportion of organic matters. It\r\nlikewise proves, in an unmistakable manner, that there is no advantage\r\nin keeping farm-yard manure for too long a period; for, after February,\r\nneither the percentage of soluble organic, nor that of soluble mineral\r\nmatter, has become greater, and the percentage of nitrogen in the manure\r\nof April and August is only a very little higher than in February.”\r\n\r\n“Before you go any further,” said the Deacon, “answer me this question:\r\nSuppose I take five tons of farm-yard manure, and put it in a heap on\r\nthe 3d of November, tell me, 1st, what that heap will contain when first\r\nmade; 2d, what the heap will contain April 30th; and, 3d, what the heap\r\nwill contain August 23d.”\r\n\r\nHere is the table:\r\n\r\n  Contents of a Heap of Manure at Different Periods, Exposed to\r\n  Rain, etc.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n                                 |When     |Apr. 30. |Aug. 23. |Nov. 15.\r\n                                 |put up,  |         |         |\r\n                                 |Nov. 3.  |         |         |\r\n  -------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n  Total weight of manure in heap |10,000   | 7,138   | 7,025   | 6,954\r\n  Water in the heap of manure    | 6,617   | 4,707   | 5,304   | 5,167\r\n  Total organic matter           | 2,824   | 1,678   | 1,034   |   947\r\n  Total inorganic matter         |   559   |   753   |   657   |   840\r\n  Total nitrogen in heap         |    64.3 |    63.9 |    46.3 |    46.0\r\n  Total soluble organic matter   |   248   |   305   |   207   |   190\r\n  Total insoluble organic matter | 2,576   | 1,373   |   857   |   757\r\n  Soluble mineral matter         |   154   |   204   |   138   |   130\r\n  Insoluble mineral matter       |   405   |   549   |   519   |   710\r\n  Nitrogen in soluble matter     |    14.9 |    21.4 |    13.2 |    12.9\r\n  Nitrogen in insoluble matter   |    49.4 |    42.5 |    33.1 |    33.1\r\n  -------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n\r\nThe Deacon put on his spectacles and studied the above table carefully\r\nfor some time. “That tells the whole story,” said he, “you put five tons\r\nof fresh manure in a heap, it ferments and gets warm, and nearly one ton\r\nof water is driven off by the heat.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Doctor, “you see that over half a ton (1,146 lbs.) of\r\ndry organic matter has been slowly burnt up in the heap; giving out as\r\nmuch heat as half a ton of coal burnt in a stove. But this is not all.\r\nThe manure is cooked, and steamed, and softened by the process. The\r\norganic matter burnt up is of no value. There is little or no loss of\r\nnitrogen. The heap contained 64.3 lbs. of nitrogen when put up, and 63.9\r\nlbs. after fermenting six months. And it is evident that the manure is\r\nin a much more active and available condition than if it had been\r\napplied to the land in the fresh state. There was 14.9 lbs. of nitrogen\r\nin a soluble condition in the fresh manure, and 21.4 lbs. in the\r\nfermented manure. And what is equally important, you will notice that\r\nthere is 154 lbs. of soluble ash in the heap of fresh manure, and 204\r\nlbs. in the heap of fermented manure. In other words, 50 lbs. of the\r\ninsoluble mineral matter had, by the fermentation of the manure, been\r\nrendered soluble, and consequently immediately available as plant-food.\r\nThis is a very important fact.”\r\n\r\nThe Doctor is right. There is clearly a great advantage in fermenting\r\nmanure, provided it is done in such a manner as to prevent loss. We have\r\nnot only less manure to draw out and spread, but the plant-food which it\r\ncontains, is more soluble and active.\r\n\r\nThe table we have given shows that there is little or no loss of\r\nvaluable constituents, even when manure is fermented in the open air and\r\nexposed to ordinary rain and snows during an English winter. But it also\r\nshows that when the manure has been fermented for six months, and is\r\nthen turned and left exposed to the rain of spring and summer, the loss\r\nis very considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe five tons (10,000 lbs.,) of fresh manure placed in a heap on the 3d\r\nof November, are reduced to 7,138 lbs. by the 30th of April. Of this\r\n4,707 lbs. is water. By the 23d of August, the heap is reduced to 7,025\r\nlbs., of which 5,304 lbs. is water. There is nearly 600 lbs. more water\r\nin the heap in August than in April.\r\n\r\nOf total nitrogen in the heap, there is 64.3 lbs. in the fresh manure,\r\n63.9 lbs. in April, and only 46.3 lbs. in August. This is a great loss,\r\nand there is no compensating gain.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, when five tons of manure is fermented for six months,\r\nin winter, the nitrogen in the soluble organic matter is increased from\r\n14.9 lbs. to 21.4 lbs. This is a decided advantage. But when the manure\r\nis kept for another six months, this soluble nitrogen is decreased from\r\n21.4 lbs. to 13.2 lbs. We lose over 8 lbs. of the most active and\r\navailable nitrogen.\r\n\r\nAnd the same remarks will apply to the valuable soluble mineral matter.\r\nIn the five tons of fresh manure there is 154 lbs. of soluble mineral\r\nmatter. By fermenting the heap six months, we get 204 lbs., but by\r\nkeeping the manure six months longer, the soluble mineral matter is\r\nreduced to 138 lbs. We lose 66 lbs. of valuable soluble mineral matter.\r\n\r\nBy fermenting manure for six months in winter, we greatly improve its\r\ncondition; by keeping it six months longer, we lose largely of the very\r\nbest and most active parts of the manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nKEEPING MANURE UNDER COVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker, at the same time he made the experiments alluded to in the\r\npreceding chapter, placed another heap of manure _under cover_, in a\r\nshed. It was the same kind of manure, and was treated precisely as the\r\nother--the only difference being that one heap was exposed to the rain,\r\nand the other not. The following table gives the results of the\r\nweighings of the heap at different times, and also the percentage of\r\nloss:\r\n\r\n  Manure Fermented Under Cover in Shed.\r\n\r\n  Table Showing the Actual Weighings, and Percentage of Loss in Weight,\r\n  of Experimental Heap (No. II.)

Whereas, when the same\r\nmanure was fermented for the same length of time in the open air, the\r\n100 tons was reduced to only 71.4-10 tons. The difference is due\r\nprincipally to the fact that the heap exposed contained more water,\r\nderived from rain and snow, than the heap kept under cover. This, of\r\ncourse, is what we should expect. Let us look at the results of Dr.\r\nVœlcker’s analyses:\r\n\r\n  Table Showing the Composition of Experimental Heap (No. II.)

They can form some idea of what they are getting. If they buy a\r\nton of fresh manure in November, they get 12¾ lbs. of nitrogen, and 30¾\r\nlbs. of soluble mineral matter. If they buy a ton of the same manure\r\nthat has been kept under cover until February, they get, nitrogen, 15\r\nlbs.; soluble minerals, 42½ lbs. In April, they get, nitrogen, 23¾ lbs.;\r\nsoluble minerals, 67½ lbs. In August, they get, nitrogen, 25½ lbs.;\r\nsoluble minerals, 61 lbs. In November, when the manure is over one year\r\nold, they get, in a ton, nitrogen, 30¼ lbs.; soluble minerals, 88½ lbs.\r\n\r\nWhen manure has not been exposed, it is clear that a purchaser can\r\nafford to pay considerably more for a ton of rotted manure than for a\r\nton of fresh manure. But waiving this point for the present, let us see\r\nhow the matter stands with the farmer who makes and uses the manure.\r\nWhat does he gain by keeping and fermenting the manure under cover?\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the weight and composition of the entire heap\r\nof manure, kept under cover, at different times:\r\n\r\n  Table Showing Composition of Entire Experimental Heap (No. II.)\r\n  Fresh Farm-Yard Manure, Under Shed.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n                                 |When put |April 30,|Aug. 23, |Nov. 15,\r\n                                 |up, Nov. |1855.    |1855.    |1855.\r\n                                 |3, 1854. |         |         |\r\n  -------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n                                 |   lbs.  |  lbs.   |  lbs.   |  lbs.\r\n  Weight of manure               | 3,258.  |1,613.   |1,297.   |1,235.\r\n                                 +---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n  Amount of water in the manure  | 2,156.  |  917.6  |  563.2  |  514.5\r\n  Amount of dry matter           | 1,102.  |  695.4  |  733.8  |  720.5\r\n  * Consisting of soluble        |         |         |         |\r\n    organic matter               |    80.77|   74.68 |   53.56 |  66.28\r\n      Soluble mineral matter     |    50.14|   54.51 |   39.55 |  54.68\r\n      † Insoluble organic matter |   839.17|  410.24 |  337.32 | 341.97\r\n      Insoluble mineral matter   |   131.92|  155.97 |  303.37 | 257.57\r\n                                 +---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n                                 | 1,102.  |  695.4  |  733.8  |  720.5\r\n                                 |         |         |         |\r\n  * Containing nitrogen          |     4.85|    4.38 |    3.46 |   5.25\r\n  Equal to ammonia               |     5.88|    5.33 |    4.20 |   6.37\r\n  † Containing nitrogen          |    16.08|   14.88 |   13.08 |  13.54\r\n  Equal to ammonia               |    19.59|   17.46 |   15.88 |  16.44\r\n  Total amount of nitrogen       |         |         |         |\r\n    in manure                    |    20.93|   19.26 |   16.54 |  18.79\r\n  Equal to ammonia               |    25.40|   22.79 |   20.08 |  22.81\r\n  The manure contains ammonia    |         |         |         |\r\n    in free state                |     1.10|     .88 |     .19 |   .23\r\n  The manure contains ammonia    |         |         |         |\r\n    in form of salts, easily     |         |         |         |\r\n    decomposed by quicklime      |     2.86|    1.62 |    1.33 |  1.80\r\n  Total amount of organic matter |   919.94|  484.92 |  390.88 | 408.25\r\n  Total amount of mineral matter |   182.06|  210.48 |  342.92 | 312.35\r\n  -------------------------------+---------+---------+---------+--------\r\n\r\nThis is the table, as given by Dr. Vœlcker.

This is precisely what I\r\nshould have expected. The heap of manure in the shed probably fermented\r\nmore rapidly than the heap out of doors, and there was not water enough\r\nin the manure to retain the carbonate of ammonia, or to favor the\r\nproduction of organic acids. _The heap was too dry._ If it could have\r\nreceived enough of the liquid from the stables to have kept it\r\nmoderately moist, the result would have been very different.\r\n\r\nWe will postpone further consideration of this point at present, and\r\nlook at the results of another of Dr. Vœlcker’s interesting experiments.\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker wished to ascertain the effect of three common methods of\r\nmanaging manure:\r\n\r\n1st. Keeping it in a _heap_ in the open air in the barn-yard, or field.\r\n\r\n2d. Keeping it in a _heap_ under cover in a shed.\r\n\r\n3d. Keeping it _spread out_ over the barn-yard.\r\n\r\n“You say these are common methods of managing manure,” remarked the\r\nDeacon, “but I never knew any one in this country take the trouble to\r\nspread manure over the yard.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” I replied, “but you have known a good many farmers who\r\nadopt this very method of keeping their manure. They do not spread\r\nit--but they let it lie spread out over the yards, just wherever it\r\nhappens to be.”\r\n\r\nLet us see what the effect of this treatment is on the composition and\r\nvalue of the manure.\r\n\r\nWe have examined the effect of keeping manure in a heap in the open air,\r\nand also of keeping it in a heap under cover. Now let us see how these\r\nmethods compare with the practice of leaving it exposed to the rains,\r\nspread out in the yard.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of November, 1854, Dr. Vœlcker weighed out 1,652 lbs. of\r\nmanure similar to that used in the preceding experiments, and spread it\r\nout in the yard. It was weighed April 30, and again August 23, and\r\nNovember 15.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the actual weight of the manure at the\r\ndifferent periods, also the actual amount of the water, organic matter,\r\nash, nitrogen, etc.:\r\n\r\n  Table Showing the Weight and Composition of Entire Mass of\r\n  Experimental Manure (No. Iii.), Fresh Farm-Yard Manure, Spread\r\n  in Open Yard at Different Periods of the Year.

The facts speak\r\nfor themselves. It will be seen that there is considerable loss even by\r\nletting the manure lie spread out until spring; but, serious as this\r\nloss is, it is small compared to the loss sustained by allowing the\r\nmanure to lie exposed in the yard during the summer.\r\n\r\nIn the five tons of fresh manure, we have, November 3, 64.3 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen; April 30, we have 46 lbs.; August 23, only 25 lbs. This is a\r\ngreat loss of the most valuable constituent of the manure. Of soluble\r\nmineral matter, the next most valuable ingredient, we have in the five\r\ntons of fresh manure, November 3, 154 lbs.; April 30, 87 lbs.; and\r\nAugust 23, only 39 lbs. Of soluble nitrogen, the most active and\r\nvaluable part of the manure, we have, November 3, nearly 15 lbs.; April\r\n30, not quite 7 lbs.; August 23, 3½ lbs.; and November 15, not quite 1¾\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker made still another experiment. He took 1,613 lbs. of\r\n_well-rotted_ dung (mixed manure from horses, cows, and pigs,) and kept\r\nit in a heap, exposed to the weather, from December 5 to April 30,\r\nAugust 23, and November 15, weighing it and analyzing it at these\r\ndifferent dates. I think it is not necessary to give the results in\r\ndetail. From the 5th of December to the 30th of April, there was _no\r\nloss_ of nitrogen in the heap, and comparatively little loss of soluble\r\nmineral matters; but from April 30 to August 23, there was considerable\r\nloss in both these valuable ingredients, which were washed out of the\r\nheap by rain.\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker draws the following conclusions from his experiments:\r\n\r\n“Having described at length my experiments with farm-yard manure,” he\r\nsays, “it may not be amiss to state briefly the more prominent and\r\npractically interesting points which have been developed in the course\r\nof this investigation. I would, therefore, observe:\r\n\r\n“1. Perfectly fresh farm yard manure contains but a small proportion of\r\nfree ammonia.\r\n\r\n“2. The nitrogen in fresh dung exists principally in the state of\r\ninsoluble nitrogenized matters.\r\n\r\n“3. The soluble organic and mineral constituents of dung are much more\r\nvaluable fertilizers than the insoluble. Particular care, therefore,\r\nshould be bestowed upon the preservation of the liquid excrements of\r\nanimals, and for the same reason the manure should be kept in perfectly\r\nwater-proof pits of sufficient capacity to render the setting up of\r\ndung-heaps in the corner of fields, as much as it is possible,\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\n“4. Farm-yard manure, even in quite a fresh state, contains phosphate of\r\nlime, which is much more soluble than has hitherto been suspected.\r\n\r\n“5. The urine of the horse, cow, and pig, does not contain any\r\nappreciable quantity of phosphate of lime, whilst the drainings of\r\ndung-heaps contain considerable quantities of this valuable fertilizer.\r\nThe drainings of dung-heaps, partly for this reason, are more valuable\r\nthan the urine of our domestic animals, and, therefore, ought to be\r\nprevented by all available means from running to waste.\r\n\r\n“6. The most effectual means of preventing loss in fertilizing matters\r\nis to cart the manure directly on the field whenever circumstances allow\r\nthis to be done.\r\n\r\n“7. On all soils with a moderate proportion of clay, no fear need to be\r\nentertained of valuable fertilizing substances becoming wasted if the\r\nmanure cannot be plowed in at once. Fresh, and even well-rotten, dung\r\ncontains very little free ammonia; and since active fermentation, and\r\nwith it the further evolution of free ammonia, is stopped by spreading\r\nout the manure on the field, valuable volatile manuring matters can not\r\nescape into the air by adopting this plan.\r\n\r\n“As all soils with a moderate proportion of clay possess in a remarkable\r\ndegree the power of absorbing and retaining manuring matters, none of\r\nthe saline and soluble organic constituents are wasted even by a heavy\r\nfall of rain. It may, indeed, be questioned whether it is more advisable\r\nto plow in the manure at once, or to let it lie for some time on the\r\nsurface, and to give the rain full opportunity to wash it into the soil.\r\n\r\n“It appears to me a matter of the greatest importance to regulate the\r\napplication of manure to our fields, so that its constituents may become\r\nproperly diluted and uniformly distributed amongst a large mass of soil.\r\nBy plowing in the manure at once, it appears to me, this desirable end\r\ncan not be reached so perfectly as by allowing the rain to wash in\r\ngradually the manure evenly spread on the surface of the field.\r\n\r\n“By adopting such a course, in case practical experience should confirm\r\nmy theoretical reasoning, the objection could no longer be maintained\r\nthat the land is not ready for carting manure upon it. I am inclined to\r\nrecommend, as a general rule: Cart the manure on the field, spread it at\r\nonce, and wait for a favorable opportunity to plow it in. In the case of\r\nclay soils, I have no hesitation to say the manure may be spread even\r\nsix months before it is plowed in, without losing any appreciable\r\nquantity in manuring matter.\r\n\r\n“I am perfectly aware, that on stiff clay land, farm-yard manure, more\r\nespecially long dung, when plowed in before the frost sets in, exercises\r\na most beneficial action by keeping the soil loose, and admitting the\r\nfree access of frost, which pulverizes the land, and would, therefore,\r\nby no means recommend to leave the manure spread on the surface without\r\nplowing it in. All I wish to enforce is, that when no other choice is\r\nleft but either to set up the manure in a heap in a corner of the field,\r\nor to spread it on the field, without plowing it in directly, to adopt\r\nthe latter plan. In the case of very light sandy soils, it may perhaps\r\nnot be advisable to spread out the manure a long time before it is\r\nplowed in, since such soils do not possess the power of retaining\r\nmanuring matters in any marked degree. On light sandy soils, I would\r\nsuggest to manure with well-fermented dung, shortly before the crop\r\nintended to be grown is sown.\r\n\r\n“8. Well-rotten dung contains, likewise, little free ammonia, but a very\r\nmuch larger proportion of soluble organic and saline mineral matters\r\nthan fresh manure.\r\n\r\n“9. Rotten dung is richer in nitrogen than fresh.\r\n\r\n“10. Weight for weight, rotten dung is more valuable than fresh.\r\n\r\n“11. In the fermentation of dung, a very considerable proportion of the\r\norganic matters in fresh manure is dissipated into the air in the form\r\nof carbonic acid and other gases.\r\n\r\n“12. Properly regulated, however, the fermentation of dung is not\r\nattended with any great loss of nitrogen, nor of saline mineral matters.\r\n\r\n“13. During the fermentation of dung, ulmic, humic, and other organic\r\nacids are formed, as well as gypsum, which fix the ammonia generated in\r\nthe decomposition of the nitrogenized constituents of dung.\r\n\r\n“14. During the fermentation of dung, the phosphate of lime which it\r\ncontains is rendered more soluble than in fresh manure.\r\n\r\n“15. In the interior and heated portions of manure-heaps, ammonia is\r\ngiven off; but, on passing into the external and cold layers of\r\ndung-heaps, the free ammonia is retained in the heap.\r\n\r\n“16. Ammonia is not given off from the surface of well-compressed\r\ndung-heaps, but on turning manure-heaps, it is wasted in appreciable\r\nquantities. Dung-heaps, for this reason, should not be turned more\r\nfrequently than absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n“17. No advantage appears to result from carrying on the fermentation of\r\ndung too far, but every disadvantage.\r\n\r\n“18. Farm-yard manure becomes deteriorated in value, when kept in heaps\r\nexposed to the weather, the more the longer it is kept.\r\n\r\n“19. The loss in manuring matters, which is incurred in keeping\r\nmanure-heaps exposed to the weather, is not so much due to the\r\nvolatilization of ammonia as to the removal of ammoniacal salts, soluble\r\nnitrogenized organic matters, and valuable mineral matters, by the rain\r\nwhich falls in the period during which the manure is kept.\r\n\r\n“20. If rain is excluded from dung-heaps, or little rain falls at a\r\ntime, the loss in ammonia is trifling, and no saline matters, of course,\r\nare removed; but, if much rain falls, especially if it descends in heavy\r\nshowers upon the dung-heap, a serious loss in ammonia, soluble organic\r\nmatter, phosphate of lime, and salts of potash is incurred, and the\r\nmanure becomes rapidly deteriorated in value, whilst at the same time it\r\nis diminished in weight.\r\n\r\n“21. Well-rotten dung is more readily affected by the deteriorating\r\ninfluence of rain than fresh manure.\r\n\r\n“22. Practically speaking, all the essentially valuable manuring\r\nconstituents are preserved by keeping farm-yard manure under cover.\r\n\r\n“23. If the animals have been supplied with plenty of litter, fresh dung\r\ncontains an insufficient quantity of water to induce an active\r\nfermentation. In this case, fresh dung can not be properly fermented\r\nunder cover, except water or liquid manure is pumped over the heap from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\n“Where much straw is used in the manufacture of dung, and no provision\r\nis made to supply the manure in the pit at any time with the requisite\r\namount of moisture, it may not be advisable to put up a roof over the\r\ndung-pit. On the other hand, on farms where there is a deficiency of\r\nstraw, so that the moisture of the excrements of our domestic animals is\r\nbarely absorbed by the litter, the advantage of erecting a roof over the\r\ndung-pit will be found very great.\r\n\r\n“24. The worst method of making manure is to produce it by animals kept\r\nin open yards, since a large proportion of valuable fertilizing matters\r\nis wasted in a short time; and after a lapse of twelve months, at least\r\ntwo-thirds of the substance of the manure is wasted, and only one-third,\r\ninferior in quality to an equal weight of fresh dung, is left behind.\r\n\r\n“25. The most rational plan of keeping manure in heaps appears to me\r\nthat adopted by Mr. Lawrence, of Cirencester, and described by him at\r\nlength in Morton’s ‘Cyclopædia of Agriculture,’ under the head of\r\n‘Manure.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nAN ENGLISH PLAN OF KEEPING MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I would like to know,” said the Deacon, “how Mr. Lawrence manages his\r\nmanure, especially as his method has received such high commendation.”\r\n\r\nCharley got the second volume of “Morton’s Cyclopædia of Agriculture,”\r\nfrom the book shelves, and turned to the article on “Manure.” He found\r\nthat Mr. Lawrence adopted the “Box System” of feeding cattle, and used\r\ncut or chaffed straw for bedding. And Mr. Lawrence claims that by this\r\nplan “manure will have been made under the most perfect conditions.” And\r\n“when the boxes are full at those periods of the year at which manure is\r\nrequired for the succeeding crops, it will be most advantageously\r\ndisposed of by being transferred at once to the land, and covered in.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the Deacon, “I think he is right there.” Charley continued,\r\nand read as follows:\r\n\r\n“But there will be accumulations of manure requiring removal from the\r\nhomestead at other seasons, at which it cannot be so applied, and when\r\nit must be stored for future use. The following has been found an\r\neffectual and economical mode of accomplishing this; more particularly\r\nwhen cut litter is used, it saves the cost of repeated turnings, and\r\neffectually prevents the decomposition and waste of the most active and\r\nvolatile principle.\r\n\r\n“Some three or more spots are selected according to the size of the\r\nfarm, in convenient positions for access to the land under tillage, and\r\nby the side of the farm roads. The sites fixed on are then excavated\r\nabout two feet under the surrounding surface. In the bottom is laid some\r\nthree or four inches of earth to absorb any moisture, on which the\r\nmanure is emptied from the carts. This is evenly spread, and well\r\ntrodden as the heap is forming. As soon as this is about a foot above\r\nthe ground level, to allow for sinking, the heap is gradually gathered\r\nin, until it is completed in the form of an ordinary steep roof,\r\nslightly rounded at the top by the final treading. In the course of\r\nbuilding this up, about a bushel of salt, to two cart-loads of dung is\r\nsprinkled amongst it. The base laid out at any one time should not\r\nexceed that required by the manure ready for the complete formation of\r\nthe heap as far as it goes; and within a day or two after such portion\r\nis built up, and it has settled into shape, a thin coat of earth in a\r\nmoist state is plastered _entirely_ over the surface. Under these\r\nconditions decomposition does not take place, in consequence of the\r\nexclusion of the air; or at any rate to so limited an extent, that the\r\nammonia is absorbed by the earth, for there is not a trace of it\r\nperceptible about the heap; though, when put together without such\r\ncovering, this is perceptible enough to leeward at a hundred yards’\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n“When heaps thus formed are resorted to in the autumn, either for the\r\nyoung seeds, or for plowing in on the stubbles after preparing for the\r\nsucceeding root crop, the manure will be found undiminished in quantity\r\nand unimpaired in quality; in fact, simply consolidated. Decomposition\r\nthen proceeds within the soil, where all its results are appropriated,\r\nand rendered available for the succeeding cereal as well as the root\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n“It would be inconvenient to plaster the heap, were the ridge, when\r\nsettled, above six or seven feet from the ground level; the base may be\r\nformed about ten to twelve feet wide, and the ridge about nine feet from\r\nthe base, which settles down to about seven feet; this may be extended\r\nto any length as further supplies of manure require removal. One man is\r\nsufficient to form the heap, and it is expedient to employ the same man\r\nfor this service, who soon gets into the way of performing the work\r\nneatly and quickly. It has been asked where a farmer is to get the earth\r\nto cover his heaps--it may be answered, keep your roads scraped when\r\nthey get muddy on the surface during rainy weather--in itself good\r\neconomy--and leave this in small heaps beyond the margin of your roads.\r\nThis, in the course of the year, will be found an ample provision for\r\nthe purpose, for it is unnecessary to lay on a coat more than one or two\r\ninches in thickness, which should be done when in a moist state. At any\r\nrate, there will always be found an accumulation on headlands that may\r\nbe drawn upon if need be.\r\n\r\n“Farmers who have not been in the habit of bestowing care on the\r\nmanufacture and subsequent preservation of their manure, and watching\r\nresults, have no conception of the importance of this. A barrowful of\r\nsuch manure as has been described, would produce a greater weight of\r\nroots and corn, than that so graphically described by the most talented\r\nand accomplished of our agricultural authors--as the contents of\r\n‘neighbour Drychaff’s dung-cart, that creaking hearse, that is carrying\r\nto the field the dead body whose spirit has departed.’\r\n\r\n“There is a source of valuable and extremely useful manure on every\r\nfarm, of which very few farmers avail themselves--the gathering together\r\nin one spot of all combustible waste and rubbish, the clippings of\r\nhedges, scouring of ditches, grassy accumulation on the sides of roads\r\nand fences, etc., combined with a good deal of earth. If these are\r\ncarted at leisure times into a large circle, or in two rows, to supply\r\nthe fire kindled in the center, in a spot which is frequented by the\r\nlaborers on the farm, with a three-pronged fork and a shovel attendant,\r\nand each passer-by is encouraged to add to the pile whenever he sees the\r\nsmoke passing away so freely as to indicate rapid combustion, a very\r\nlarge quantity of valuable ashes are collected between March and\r\nOctober. In the latter month the fire should be allowed to go out; the\r\nashes are then thrown into a long ridge, as high as they will stand, and\r\nthatched while dry. This will be found an invaluable store in April,\r\nMay, and June, capable of supplying from twenty to forty bushels of\r\nashes per acre, according to the care and industry of the collector, to\r\ndrill with the seeds of the root crop.”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon got sleepy before Charley finished reading. “We can not\r\nafford to be at so much trouble in this country,” he said, and took up\r\nhis hat and left.\r\n\r\nThe Deacon is not altogether wrong. Our climate is very different from\r\nthat of England, and it is seldom that farmers need to draw out manure,\r\nand pile it in the field, except in winter, and then it is not\r\nnecessary, I think, either to dig a pit or to cover the heap. Those who\r\ndraw manure from the city in summer, may probably adopt some of Mr.\r\nLawrence’s suggestions with advantage.\r\n\r\nThe plan of collecting rubbish, brush, old wood, and sods, and\r\nconverting them into ashes or charcoal, is one which we could often\r\nadopt with decided advantage. Our premises would be cleaner, and we\r\nshould have less fungus to speck and crack our apples and pears, and, in\r\naddition, we should have a quantity of ashes or burnt earth, that is not\r\nonly a manure itself, but is specially useful to mix with moist\r\nsuperphosphate and other artificial manures, to make them dry enough and\r\nbulky enough to be easily and evenly distributed by the drill.\r\nArtificial manures, so mixed with these ashes, or dry, charred earth,\r\nare less likely to injure the seed than when sown with the seed in the\r\ndrill-rows, unmixed with some such material. Sifted coal ashes are also\r\nvery useful for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSOLUBLE PHOSPHATES IN FARMYARD MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one thing in these experiments of Dr. Vœlcker’s which deserves\r\nspecial attention, and that is the comparatively large amount of\r\n_soluble phosphate of lime_ in the ash of farm-yard manure. I do not\r\nthink the fact is generally known. In estimating the value of animal\r\nmanures, as compared with artificial manures, it is usually assumed that\r\nthe phosphates in the former are insoluble, and, therefore, of less\r\nvalue than the soluble phosphates in superphosphate of lime and other\r\nartificial manures.\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker found in the ash of _fresh_ farm-yard manure, phosphoric\r\nacid equal to 12.23 per cent of phosphate of lime, and of this 5.35 was\r\n_soluble_ phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\nIn the ash of well-rotted manure, he found phosphoric acid equal to\r\n12.11 per cent of phosphate of lime, and of this, 4.75 was soluble\r\nphosphate of lime.\r\n\r\n“That is, indeed, an important fact,” said the Doctor, “but I thought\r\nProfessor Vœlcker claimed that ‘during the fermentation of dung, the\r\nphosphate of lime which it contains is rendered more soluble than in\r\nfresh manure.’”\r\n\r\n“He did say so,” I replied, “and it may be true, but the above figures\r\ndo not seem to prove it. When he wrote the sentence you have quoted, he\r\nprobably had reference to the fact that he found more soluble phosphate\r\nof lime in rotted manure than in fresh manure. Thus, he found in 5 tons\r\nof fresh and 5 tons of rotted, manure, the following ingredients:\r\n\r\n  SP:  Soluble Phosphate of Lime.\r\n  IP:  Insoluble phosphates.\r\n  TP:  Total Phosphates.\r\n  TSA: Total Soluble Ash.\r\n  TIA: Total Insoluble Ash.\r\n  TA:  Total Ash.\r\n\r\n  --------------+-----+-----+-----+-------------+-----+-----+-----\r\n                |     |     |     |   Potash    |     |     |\r\n     5 Tons.    | SP  | IP  | TP  +------+------+ TSA | TIA | TA\r\n  (10,000 LBS.) |     |     |     | Sol. |Insol.|     |     |\r\n  --------------+-----+-----+-----+------+------+-----+-----+-----\r\n  Fresh manure  | 29.9| 38.6| 68.5| 57.3 |  9.9 | 154 | 405 | 559\r\n  Rotted manure | 38.2|57.3 |95.5 | 44.6 |  4.5 | 147 | 658 | 805\r\n  --------------+-----+-----+-----+------+------+-----+-----+-----\r\n\r\n“It will be seen from the above figures that _rotted manure contains\r\nmore soluble phosphate of lime than fresh manure_.\r\n\r\n“But it does not follow from this fact that any of the insoluble\r\nphosphates in fresh manure have been rendered soluble during the\r\nfermentation of the manure.\r\n\r\n“There are more insoluble phosphates in the rotted manure than in the\r\nfresh, but we do not conclude from this fact that any of the phosphates\r\nhave been rendered insoluble during the process of fermentation--neither\r\nare we warranted in concluding that any of them have been rendered\r\nsoluble, simply because we find more soluble phosphates in the rotted\r\nmanure.”\r\n\r\n“Very true,” said the Doctor, “but it has been shown that _in the heap_\r\nof manure, during fermentation, there was an _actual increase_ of\r\nsoluble mineral matter during the first six months, and, to say the\r\nleast, it is highly probable that some of this increase of soluble\r\nmineral matter contained more or less soluble phosphates, and perhaps\r\nDr. Vœlcker had some facts to show that such was the case, although he\r\nmay not have published them. At any rate, he evidently thinks that the\r\nphosphates in manure are rendered more soluble by fermentation.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said I, “we can not do better than to let the matter rest in\r\nthat form. I am merely anxious not to draw definite conclusions from the\r\nfacts which the facts do not positively prove. I am strongly in favor of\r\nfermenting manure, and should be glad to have it shown that fermentation\r\ndoes actually convert insoluble phosphates into a soluble form.”\r\n\r\nThere is one thing, however, that these experiments clearly prove, and\r\nthat is, that there is a far larger quantity of _soluble_ phosphates in\r\nmanure than is generally supposed. Of the total phosphoric acid in the\r\nfresh manure, 43 per cent is in a soluble condition; and in the rotted\r\nmanure, 40 per cent is soluble.\r\n\r\nThis is an important fact, and one which is generally overlooked. It\r\nenhances the value of farm-yard or stable manure, as compared with\r\nartificial manures. But of this we may have more to say when we come to\r\nthat part of the subject. I want to make one remark. I think there can\r\nbe little doubt that the proportion of soluble phosphates is greater in\r\nrich manure, made from grain-fed animals, than in poor manure made\r\nprincipally from straw. In other words, of 100 lbs. of total phosphoric\r\nacid, more of it would be in a soluble condition in the rich than in the\r\npoor manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE DEACON MAKES MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I think,” said the Deacon, “you are talking too much about the science\r\nof manure making. Science is all well enough, but practice is better.”\r\n\r\n“That depends,” said I, “on the practice. Suppose you tell us how you\r\nmanage your manure.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Deacon, “I do not know much about plant-food, and\r\nnitrogen, and phosphoric acid, but I think manure is a good thing, and\r\nthe more you have of it the better. I do not believe in your practice of\r\nspreading manure on the land and letting it lie exposed to the sun and\r\nwinds. I want to draw it out in the spring and plow it under for corn.\r\nI think this long, coarse manure loosens the soil and makes it light,\r\nand warm, and porous. And then my plan saves labor. More than half of my\r\nmanure is handled but once. It is made in the yard and sheds, and lies\r\nthere until it is drawn to the field in the spring. The manure from the\r\ncow and horse stables, and from the pig-pens, is thrown into the yard,\r\nand nothing is done to it except to level it down occasionally. In\r\nproportion to the stock kept, I think I make twice as much manure as you\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “twice as much _in bulk_, but one load of my manure is\r\nworth four loads of your long, coarse manure, composed principally of\r\ncorn-stalks, straw, and water. I think you are wise in not spending much\r\ntime in piling and working over such manure.”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon and I have a standing quarrel about manure. We differ on all\r\npoints. He is a good man, but not what we call a good farmer. He cleared\r\nup his farm from the original forest, and he has always been content to\r\nreceive what his land would give him. If he gets good crops, well, if\r\nnot, his expenses are moderate, and he manages to make both ends meet.\r\nI tell him he could double his crops, and quadruple his profits, by\r\nbetter farming--but though he cannot disprove the facts, he is unwilling\r\nto make any change in his system of farming. And so he continues to make\r\njust as much manure as the crops he is obliged to feed out leave in his\r\nyards, and no more. He does not, in fact, _make_ any manure. He takes\r\nwhat comes, and gets it on to his land with as little labor as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is no use arguing with such a man. And it certainly will not do to\r\ncontend that his method of _managing_ manure is all wrong. His error is\r\nin making such poor manure. But with such poor stuff as he has in his\r\nyard, I believe he is right to get rid of it with the least expense\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nI presume, too, that the Deacon is not altogether wrong in regard to the\r\ngood mechanical effects of manure on undrained and indifferently\r\ncultivated land. I have no doubt that he bases his opinion on\r\nexperience. The good effects of such manure as he makes must be largely\r\ndue to its mechanical action--it can do little towards supplying the\r\nmore important and valuable elements of plant-food.\r\n\r\nI commend the Deacon’s system of managing manure to all such as make a\r\nsimilar article. But I think there is a more excellent way. Feed the\r\nstock better, make richer manure, and then it will pay to bestow a\r\nlittle labor in taking care of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nHOW JOHN JOHNSTON MANAGES HIS MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest and most successful farmers, in the State of New York,\r\nis John Johnston, of Geneva. He has a farm on the borders of Seneca\r\nLake. It is high, rolling land, but needed underdraining. This has been\r\nthoroughly done--and done with great profit and advantage. The soil is a\r\nheavy clay loam. Mr. Johnston has been in the habit of summer-fallowing\r\nlargely for wheat, generally plowing three, and sometimes four times. He\r\nhas been a very successful wheat-grower, almost invariably obtaining\r\nlarge crops of wheat, both of grain and straw. The straw he feeds to\r\nsheep in winter, putting more straw in the racks than the sheep can eat\r\nup clean, and using what they leave for bedding. The sheep run in yards\r\nenclosed with tight board fences, and have sheds under the barn to lie\r\nin at pleasure.\r\n\r\nAlthough the soil is rather heavy for Indian corn, Mr. Johnston succeeds\r\nin growing large crops of this great American cereal. Corn and stalks\r\nare both fed out on the farm. Mr. J. has not yet practised cutting up\r\nhis straw and stalks into chaff.\r\n\r\nThe land is admirably adapted to the growth of red clover, and great\r\ncrops of clover and timothy-hay are raised, and fed out on the farm.\r\nGypsum, or plaster, is sown quite freely on the clover in the spring.\r\nComparatively few roots are raised--not to exceed an acre--and these\r\nonly quite recently. The main crops are winter wheat, spring barley,\r\nIndian corn, clover, and timothy-hay, and clover-seed.\r\n\r\nThe materials for making manure, then, are wheat and barley straw,\r\nIndian corn, corn-stalks, clover, and timothy-hay. These are all raised\r\non the farm. But Mr. Johnston has for many years purchased linseed-oil\r\ncake, to feed to his sheep and cattle.\r\n\r\nThis last fact must not be overlooked. Mr. J. commenced to feed oil-cake\r\nwhen its value was little known here, and when he bought it for,\r\nI think, seven or eight dollars a ton. He continued to use it even when\r\nhe had to pay fifty dollars per ton. Mr. J. has great faith in\r\nmanure--and it is a faith resting on good evidence and long experience.\r\nIf he had not fed out so much oil-cake and clover-hay, he would not have\r\nfound his manure so valuable.\r\n\r\n“How much oil-cake does he use?” asked the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“He gives his sheep, on the average, about 1 lb. each per day.”\r\n\r\nIf he feeds out a ton of clover-hay, two tons of straw, (for feed and\r\nbedding,) and one ton of oil-cake, the manure obtained from this\r\nquantity of food and litter, would be worth, according to Mr. Lawes’\r\ntable, given on page 45, $34.72.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if he fed out one ton of corn, one ton of clover-hay,\r\nand two tons of straw, for feed and bedding, the manure would be worth\r\n$21.65.\r\n\r\nIf he fed one ton of corn, and three tons of straw, the manure would be\r\nworth only $14.69.\r\n\r\nHe would get _as much manure_ from the three tons of straw and one ton\r\nof corn, as from the two tons of straw, one ton of clover-hay, and one\r\nton of oil-cake, while, as before said, the manure in the one case would\r\nbe worth $14.69, and in the other $34.72.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a load of the good manure would be worth, when spread\r\nout on the land in the field or garden, more than two loads of the straw\r\nand corn manure.\r\n\r\nTo get the same amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, you\r\nhave to spend more than twice the labor in cleaning out the stables or\r\nyards, more than twice the labor of throwing or wheeling it to the\r\nmanure pile, more than twice the labor of turning the manure in the\r\npile, more than twice the labor of loading it on the carts or wagons,\r\nmore than twice the labor of drawing it to the field, more than twice\r\nthe labor of unloading it into heaps, and more than twice the labor of\r\nspreading it in the one case than in the other, and, after all, twenty\r\ntons of this poor manure would not produce as good an effect the first\r\nseason as ten tons of the richer manure.\r\n\r\n“Why so?” asked the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“Simply because the poor manure is not so active as the richer manure.\r\nIt will not decompose so readily. Its nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and\r\npotash, are not so available. The twenty tons, _may_, in the long run,\r\ndo as much good as the ten tons, but I very much doubt it. At any rate,\r\nI would greatly prefer the ten tons of the good manure to twenty tons of\r\nthe poor--even when spread out on the land, ready to plow under. What\r\nthe difference would be in the value of the manure _in the yard_, you\r\ncan figure for yourself. It would depend on the cost of handling,\r\ndrawing, and spreading the extra ten tons.”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon estimates the cost of loading, drawing, unloading, and\r\nspreading, at fifty cents a ton. This is probably not far out of the\r\nway, though much depends on the distance the manure has to be drawn, and\r\nalso on the condition of the manure, etc.\r\n\r\nThe four tons of feed and bedding will make, at a rough estimate about\r\nten tons of manure.\r\n\r\nThis ten tons of straw and corn manure, according to Mr. Lawes’\r\nestimate, is worth, _in the field_, $14.69. And if it costs fifty cents\r\na load to get it on the land, its value, _in the yard_, would be\r\n$9.69--or nearly ninety-seven cents a ton.\r\n\r\nThe ten tons of good manure, according to the same estimate, is worth,\r\n_in the field_, $34.72, and, consequently, would be worth, _in the\r\nyard_, $29.72. In other words, a ton of poor manure is worth, in the\r\nyard, ninety-seven cents a ton, and the good manure $2.97.\r\n\r\nAnd so in describing John Johnston’s method of managing manure, this\r\nfact must be borne in mind. It might not pay the Deacon to spend much\r\nlabor on manure worth only ninety-seven cents a ton, while it might pay\r\nJohn Johnston to bestow some considerable time and labor on manure worth\r\n$2.97 per ton.\r\n\r\n“But is it really worth this sum?” asked the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“In reply to that,” said I, “all I claim is that the figures are\r\ncomparative. If your manure, made as above described, is worth\r\nninety-seven cents a ton in the yard, _then_ John Johnston’s manure,\r\nmade as stated, is _certainly_ worth, at least, $2.97 per ton in the\r\nyard.”\r\n\r\nOf this there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\n“If you think,” I continued, “your manure, so made, is worth only half\r\nas much as Mr. Lawes’ estimate; in other words, if your ten tons of\r\nmanure, instead of being worth $14.69 in the field, is worth only $7.35;\r\nthen John Johnston’s ten tons of manure, instead of being worth $34.72\r\nin the field, is worth only $17.36.”\r\n\r\n“That looks a little more reasonable,” said the Deacon, “John Johnston’s\r\nmanure, instead of being worth $2.97 per ton in the yard, is worth only\r\n$1.48 per ton, and mine, instead of being worth ninety-seven cents a\r\nton, is worth forty-eight and a half cents a ton.”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon sat for a few minutes looking at these figures. “They do not\r\nseem so extravagantly high as I thought them at first,” he said, “and if\r\nyou will reduce the figures in Mr. Lawes’ table one-half all through, it\r\nwill be much nearer the truth. I think my manure is worth forty-eight\r\nand a half cents a ton in the yard, and if your figures are correct,\r\nI suppose I must admit that John Johnston’s manure is worth $1.48 per\r\nton in the yard.”\r\n\r\nI was very glad to get such an admission from the Deacon. He did not see\r\nthat he had made a mistake in the figures, and so I got him to go over\r\nthe calculation again.\r\n\r\n“You take a pencil, Deacon,” said I, “and write down the figures:\r\n\r\n  Manure from a ton of oil-cake                   $19.72\r\n  Manure from a ton of clover-hay                   9.64\r\n  Manure from two tons of straw                     5.36\r\n                                                 --------\r\n                                                  $34.72\r\n\r\n“This would make about ten tons of manure. We have agreed to reduce the\r\nestimate one-half, and consequently we have $17.36 as the value of the\r\nten tons of manure.\r\n\r\n“This is John Johnston’s manure. It is worth $1.73 per ton in the field.\r\n\r\n“It costs, we have estimated, 50 cents a ton to handle the manure, and\r\nconsequently it is worth in the yard $1.23 per ton.”\r\n\r\n“This is less than we made it before,” said the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“Never mind that,” said I, “the figures are correct. Now write down what\r\nyour manure is worth:\r\n\r\n  Manure from 1 ton of corn                        $6.65\r\n  Manure from 3 tons of straw                       8.04\r\n                                                 --------\r\n                                                  $14.69\r\n\r\n“This will make about ten tons of manure. In this case, as in the other,\r\nwe are to reduce the estimate one-half. Consequently, we have $7.35 as\r\nthe value of this ten tons of manure in the field, or 73½ cents a ton.\r\nIt costs, we have estimated, 50 cents a ton to handle the manure, and,\r\ntherefore, it is worth _in the yard_, 23½ cents a ton.”\r\n\r\n“John Johnston’s manure is worth in the yard, $1.23 per ton. The\r\nDeacon’s manure is worth in the yard, 23½ cents per ton.”\r\n\r\n“There is some mistake,” exclaimed the Deacon, “you said, at first, that\r\none load of John Johnston’s manure was worth as much as two of my loads.\r\nNow you make one load of his manure worth more than five loads of my\r\nmanure. This is absurd.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, Deacon,” said I, “you made the figures yourself. You\r\nthought Mr. Lawes’ estimate too high. You reduced it one-half. The\r\nfigures are correct, and you must accept the conclusion. If John\r\nJohnston’s manure is only worth $1.23 per ton in the yard, yours, made\r\nfrom 1 ton of corn and 3 tons of straw, is only worth 23½ cents per\r\nton.”\r\n\r\n“And now, Deacon,” I continued, “while you have a pencil in your hand,\r\nI want you to make one more calculation. Assuming that Mr. Lawes’\r\nestimate is too high, and we reduce it one-half, figure up what manure\r\nis worth when made from straw alone. You take 4 tons of wheat straw,\r\nfeed out part, and use part for bedding. It will give you about 10 tons\r\nof manure. And this 10 tons cost you 50 cents a ton to load, draw out,\r\nand spread. Now figure:\r\n\r\n“Four tons of straw is worth, for manure, according to Mr. Lawes’ table,\r\n$2.68 per ton. We have agreed to reduce the figures one half, and so the\r\n\r\n  10 tons of manure from the 4 tons of straw is worth   $5.36\r\n  Drawing out 10 tons of manure at 50 cents              5.00\r\n                                                      --------\r\n  Value of 10 tons of straw-manure _in yard_            $0.36\r\n\r\n“In other words, if John Johnston’s manure is worth only $1.23 per ton\r\nin the yard, the straw-made manure is worth only a little over 3½ cents\r\na ton in the yard.”\r\n\r\n“That is _too_ absurd,” said the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I replied, “for once I am glad to agree with you. But if\r\nthis is absurd, then it follows that Mr. Lawes’ estimate of the value of\r\ncertain foods for manure is not so extravagant as you supposed--which is\r\nprecisely what I wished to prove.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“You have not told us how Mr. Johnston manages his manure,” said the\r\nDeacon.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing very remarkable about it,” I replied. “There are many\r\nfarmers in this neighborhood who adopt the same method. I think,\r\nhowever, John Johnston was the first to recommend it, and subjected\r\nhimself to some criticism from some of the so-called scientific writers\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\n“His general plan is to leave the manure in the yards, basements, and\r\nsheds, under the sheep, until spring. He usually sells his fat sheep in\r\nMarch. As soon as the sheep are removed, the manure is either thrown up\r\ninto loose heaps in the yard, or drawn directly to the field, where it\r\nis to be used, and made into a heap there. The manure is not spread on\r\nthe land until the autumn. It remains in the heaps or piles all summer,\r\nbeing usually turned once, and sometimes twice. The manure becomes\r\nthoroughly rotted.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Johnston, like the Deacon, applies his manure to the corn crop. But\r\nthe Deacon draws out his fresh green manure in the spring, on sod-land,\r\nand plows it under. Mr. Johnston, on the other hand, keeps his manure in\r\na heap through the summer, spreads it on the sod in September, or the\r\nfirst week in October. Here it lies until next spring. The grass and\r\nclover grow up through manure, and the grass and manure are turned under\r\nnext spring, and the land planted to corn.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnston is thoroughly convinced that he gets far more benefit from\r\nthe manure when applied on the surface, and left exposed for several\r\nmonths, than if he plowed it under at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like to write and talk about John Johnston. I like to visit him. He is\r\nso delightfully enthusiastic, believes so thoroughly in good farming,\r\nand has been so eminently successful, that a day spent in his company\r\ncan not fail to encourage any farmer to renewed efforts in improving his\r\nsoil. “You _must_ drain,” he wrote to me; “when I first commenced\r\nfarming, I never made any money until I began to underdrain.” But it is\r\nnot underdraining alone that is the cause of his eminent success. When\r\nhe bought his farm, “near Geneva,” over fifty years ago, there was a\r\npile of manure in the yard that had lain there year after year, until it\r\nwas, as he said, “as black as my hat.” The former owner regarded it as a\r\nnuisance, and a few months before young Johnston bought the farm, had\r\ngiven some darkies a cow on condition that they would draw out this\r\nmanure. They drew out six loads, took the cow--and that was the last\r\nseen of them. Johnston drew out this manure, raised a good crop of\r\nwheat, and that gave him a start. He says he has been asked a great many\r\ntimes to what he owes his success as a farmer, and he has replied that\r\nhe could not tell whether it was “dung or credit.” It was probably\r\nneither. It was the man--his intelligence, industry, and good common\r\nsense. That heap of black mould was merely an instrument in his hands\r\nthat he could turn to good account.\r\n\r\nHis first crop of wheat gave him “credit” and this also he used to\r\nadvantage. He believed that good farming would pay, and it was this\r\nfaith in a generous soil that made him willing to spend the money\r\nobtained from the first crop of wheat in enriching the land, and to\r\navail himself of his credit. Had he lacked this faith--had he hoarded\r\nevery sixpence he could have ground out of the soil, who would have ever\r\nheard of John Johnston? He has been liberal with his crops and his\r\nanimals, and has ever found them grateful. This is the real lesson which\r\nhis life teaches.\r\n\r\nHe once wrote me he had something to show me. He did not tell me what it\r\nwas, and when I got there, he took me to a field of grass that was to be\r\nmown for hay. The field had been in winter wheat the year before. At the\r\ntime of sowing the wheat, the whole field was seeded down with timothy.\r\nNo clover was sown, either then or in the spring; but after the wheat\r\nwas sown, he put on a slight dressing of manure on two portions of the\r\nfield that he thought were poor. He told the man to spread it out of the\r\nwagon just as thin as he could distribute it evenly over the land. It\r\nwas a very light manuring, but the manure was rich, and thoroughly\r\nrotted. I do not recollect whether the effect of the manure was\r\nparticularly noticed on the wheat; but on the grass, the following\r\nspring, the effect was sufficiently striking. Those two portions of the\r\nfield where the manure was spread were _covered with a splendid crop of\r\nred clover_. You could see the exact line, in both cases, where the\r\nmanure reached. It looked quite curious. No clover-seed was sown, and\r\nyet there was as fine a crop of clover as one could desire.\r\n\r\nOn looking into the matter more closely, we found that there was more or\r\nless clover all over the field, but where the manure was not used, it\r\ncould hardly be seen. The plants were small, and the timothy hid them\r\nfrom view. But where the manure was used, these plants of clover had\r\nbeen stimulated in their growth until they covered the ground. The\r\nleaves were broad and vigorous, while in the other case they were small,\r\nand almost dried up. This is probably the right explanation. The manure\r\ndid not “bring in the clover;” it simply increased the growth of that\r\nalready in the soil. It shows the value of manure for grass.\r\n\r\nThis is what Mr. Johnston wanted to show me. “I might have written and\r\ntold you, but you would not have got a clear idea of the matter.” This\r\nis true. One had to see the great luxuriance of that piece of clover to\r\nfully appreciate the effect of the manure. Mr. J. said the manure on\r\nthat grass was worth $30 an acre--that is, on the three crops of grass,\r\nbefore the field is again plowed. I have no doubt that this is true, and\r\nthat the future crops on the land will also be benefited--not directly\r\nfrom the manure, perhaps, but from the clover-roots in the soil. And if\r\nthe field were pastured, the effect on future crops would be very\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMY OWN PLAN OF MANAGING MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the charms and the advantages of agriculture is that a farmer\r\nmust think for himself. He should study principles, and apply them in\r\npractice, as best suits his circumstances.\r\n\r\nMy own method of managing manure gives me many of the advantages claimed\r\nfor the Deacon’s method, and John Johnston’s, also.\r\n\r\n“I do not understand what you mean,” said the Deacon; “my method differs\r\nessentially from that of John Johnston.”\r\n\r\n“True,” I replied, “you use your winter-made manure in the spring; while\r\nMr. Johnston piles his, and gets it thoroughly fermented; but to do\r\nthis, he has to keep it until the autumn, and it does not benefit his\r\ncorn-crop before the next summer. He loses the use of his manure for a\r\nyear.”\r\n\r\nI think my method secures both these advantages. I get my winter-made\r\nmanure fermented and in good condition, and yet have it ready for spring\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I should remark that my usual plan is to cut up all\r\nthe fodder for horses, cows, and sheep. For horses, I sometimes use long\r\nstraw for bedding, but, as a rule, I prefer to run everything through a\r\nfeed-cutter. We do not steam the food, and we let the cows and sheep\r\nhave a liberal supply of cut corn-stalks and straw, and what they do not\r\neat is thrown out of the mangers and racks, and used for bedding.\r\n\r\nI should state, too, that I keep a good many pigs, seldom having less\r\nthan 50 breeding sows. My pigs are mostly sold at from two to four\r\nmonths old, but we probably average 150 head the year round. A good deal\r\nof my manure, therefore, comes from the pig-pens, and from two basement\r\ncellars, where my store hogs sleep in winter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the pigs, we have on the farm from 150 to 200 Cotswold\r\nand grade sheep; 10 cows, and 8 horses. These are our manure makers.\r\n\r\nThe raw material from which the manure is manufactured consists of\r\nwheat, barley, rye, and oat-straw, corn-stalks, corn-fodder, clover and\r\ntimothy-hay, clover seed-hay, bean-straw, pea-straw, potato-tops,\r\nmangel-wurzel, turnips, rape, and mustard. These are all raised on the\r\nfarm; and, in addition to the home-grown oats, peas, and corn, we buy\r\nand feed out considerable quantities of bran, shorts, fine-middlings,\r\nmalt-combs, corn-meal, and a little oil-cake. I sell wheat, rye, barley,\r\nand clover-seed, apples, and potatoes, and sometimes cabbages and\r\nturnips. Probably, on the average, for each $100 I receive from the sale\r\nof these crops, I purchase $25 worth of bran, malt-combs, corn-meal, and\r\nother feed for animals. My farm is now rapidly increasing in fertility\r\nand productiveness. The crops, on the average, are certainly at least\r\ndouble what they were when I bought the farm thirteen years ago; and\r\nmuch of this increase has taken place during the last five or six years,\r\nand I expect to see still greater improvement year by year.\r\n\r\n“Never mind all that,” said the Deacon; “we all know that manure will\r\nenrich land, and I will concede that your farm has greatly improved, and\r\ncan not help but improve if you continue to make and use as much\r\nmanure.”\r\n\r\n“I expect to make more and more manure every year,” said I. “The larger\r\nthe crops, the more manure we can make; and the more manure we make, the\r\nlarger the crops.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real point of difference between my plan of managing manure, and the\r\nplan adopted by the Deacon, is essentially this: I aim to keep all my\r\nmanure in a compact pile, where it will slowly ferment all winter. The\r\nDeacon throws his horse-manure into a heap, just outside the stable\r\ndoor, and the cow-manure into another heap, and the pig-manure into\r\nanother heap. These heaps are more or less scattered, and are exposed to\r\nthe rain, and snow, and frost. The horse-manure is quite likely to\r\nferment too rapidly, and if in a large heap, and the weather is warm, it\r\nnot unlikely “fire-fangs” in the center of the heap. On the other hand,\r\nthe cow-manure lies cold and dead, and during the winter freezes into\r\nsolid lumps.\r\n\r\nI wheel or cart all my manure into one central heap. The main object is\r\nto keep it as compact as possible. There are two advantages in this:\r\n1st, the manure is less exposed to the rain, and (2d), when freezing\r\nweather sets in, only a few inches of the external portion of the heap\r\nis frozen. I have practised this plan for several years, and can keep my\r\nheap of manure slowly fermenting during the whole winter.\r\n\r\nBut in order to ensure this result, it is necessary to begin making the\r\nheap before winter sets in. The plan is this:\r\n\r\nHaving selected the spot in the yard most convenient for making the\r\nheap, collect all the manure that can be found in the sheepyards, sheds,\r\ncow and horse stables, pig-pens, and hen-house, together with leaves,\r\nweeds, and refuse from the garden, and wheel or cart it to the intended\r\nheap. If you set a farm-man to do the work, tell him you want to make a\r\nhot-bed about five feet high, six feet wide, and six feet long. I do not\r\nthink I have ever seen a farm where enough material could not be found,\r\nsay in November, to make such a heap. And this is all that is needed. If\r\nthe manure is rich, if it is obtained from animals eating clover-hay,\r\nbran, grain, or other food rich in nitrogen, it will soon ferment. But\r\nif the manure is poor, consisting largely of straw, it will be very\r\ndesirable to make it richer by mixing with it bone-dust, blood,\r\nhen-droppings, woollen rags, chamber-lye, and animal matter of any kind\r\nthat you can find.\r\n\r\nThe richer you can make the manure, the more readily will it ferment.\r\nA good plan is to take the horse or sheep manure, a few weeks previous,\r\nand use it for bedding the pigs. It will absorb the liquid of the pigs,\r\nand make rich manure, which will soon ferment when placed in a heap.\r\n\r\nIf the manure in the heap is too dry, it is a good plan, when you are\r\nkilling hogs, to throw on to the manure all the warm water, hair, blood,\r\nintestines, etc. You may think I am making too much of such a simple\r\nmatter, but I have had letters from farmers who have tried this plan of\r\nmanaging manure, and they say that they can not keep it from freezing.\r\nOne reason for this is, that they do not start the heap early enough,\r\nand do not take pains to get the manure into an active fermentation\r\nbefore winter sets in. Much depends on this. In starting a fire, you\r\ntake pains to get a little fine, dry wood, that will burn readily, and\r\nwhen the fire is fairly going, put on larger sticks, and presently you\r\nhave such a fire that you can burn wood, coal, stubble, sods, or\r\nanything you wish. And so it is with a manure-heap. Get the fire, or\r\nfermentation, or, more strictly speaking, putrefaction fairly started,\r\nand there will be little trouble, if the heap is large enough, and fresh\r\nmaterial is added from time to time, of continuing the fermentation all\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nAnother point to be observed, and especially in cold weather, is to keep\r\nthe sides of the heap straight, and the _top level_. You must expose the\r\nmanure in the heap as little as possible to frost and cold winds. The\r\nrule should be to spread every wheel-barrowful of manure as soon as it\r\nis put on the heap. If left unspread on top of the heap, it will freeze;\r\nand if afterwards covered with other manure, it will require\r\nconsiderable heat to melt it, and thus reduce the temperature of the\r\nwhole heap.\r\n\r\nIt is far less work to manage a heap of manure in this way than may be\r\nsupposed from my description of the plan. The truth is, I find, in point\r\nof fact, that it is _not_ an easy thing to manage manure in this way;\r\nand I fear not one farmer in ten will succeed the first winter he\r\nundertakes it, unless he gives it his personal attention. It is well\r\nworth trying, however, because if your heap should freeze up, it will\r\nbe, at any rate, in no worse condition than if managed in the ordinary\r\nway; and if you do succeed, even in part, you will have manure in good\r\ncondition for immediate use in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, I keep a good many pigs. Now pigs, if fed on\r\nslops, void a large quantity of liquid manure, and it is not always easy\r\nto furnish straw enough to absorb it. When straw and stalks are cut into\r\nchaff, they will absorb much more liquid than when used whole. For this\r\nreason we usually cut all our straw and stalks. We also use the litter\r\nfrom the horse-stable for bedding the store hogs, and also sometimes,\r\nwhen comparatively dry, we use the refuse sheep bedding for the same\r\npurpose. Where the sheep barn is contiguous to the pig-pens, and when\r\nthe sheep bedding can be thrown at once into the pig-pens or cellar, it\r\nis well to use bedding freely for the sheep and lambs, and remove it\r\nfrequently, throwing it into the pig-pens. I do not want my sheep to be\r\ncompelled to eat up the straw and corn-stalks too close. I want them to\r\npick out what they like, and then throw away what they leave in the\r\ntroughs for bedding. Sometimes we take out a five-bushel basketful of\r\nthese direct from the troughs, for bedding young pigs, or sows and pigs\r\nin the pens, but as a rule, we use them first for bedding the sheep, and\r\nthen afterwards use the sheep bedding in the fattening or store\r\npig-pens.\r\n\r\n“And sometimes,” remarked the Deacon, “you use a little long straw for\r\nyour young pigs to sleep on, so that they can bury themselves in the\r\nstraw and keep warm.”\r\n\r\n“True,” I replied, “and it is not a bad plan, but we are not now talking\r\nabout the management of pigs, but how we treat our manure, and how we\r\nmanage to have it ferment all winter.”\r\n\r\nA good deal of our pig-manure is, to borrow a phrase from the\r\npomologists, “double-worked.” It is horse or sheep-manure, used for\r\nbedding pigs and cows. It is saturated with urine, and is much richer in\r\nnitrogenous material than ordinary manure, and consequently will ferment\r\nor putrefy much more rapidly. Usually pig-manure is considered “cold,”\r\nor sluggish, but this doubleworked pig-manure will ferment even more\r\nrapidly than sheep or horse-manure alone.\r\n\r\nUnmixed cow-manure is heavy and cold, and when kept in a heap by itself\r\nout of doors, is almost certain to freeze up solid during the winter.\r\n\r\nWe usually wheel out our cow-dung every day, and spread on the manure\r\nheap.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the things that needs attention. There will be a constant\r\ntendency to put all the cow-dung together, instead of mixing it with the\r\nlighter and more active manure from the horses, sheep, and pigs. Spread\r\nit out and cover it with some of the more strawy manure, which is not so\r\nliable to freeze.\r\n\r\nShould it so happen--as will most likely be the case--that on looking at\r\nyour heap some morning when the thermometer is below zero, you find that\r\nseveral wheel-barrowfuls of manure that were put on the heap the day\r\nbefore, were not spread, and are now crusted over with ice, it will be\r\nwell to break up the barrowfuls, even if necessary to use a crowbar, and\r\nplace the frozen lumps of manure on the outside of the heap, rather than\r\nto let them lie in the center of the pile. Your aim should be always to\r\nkeep the center of the heap warm and in a state of fermentation. You do\r\nnot want the fire to go out, and it will not go out if the heap is\r\nproperly managed, even should all the sides and top be crusted over with\r\na layer of frozen manure.\r\n\r\nDuring very severe weather, and when the top is frozen, it is a good\r\nplan, when you are about to wheel some fresh manure on to the heap, to\r\nremove a portion of the frozen crust on top of the heap, near the\r\ncenter, and make a hole for the fresh manure, which should be spread and\r\ncovered up.\r\n\r\nWhen the heap is high enough, say five feet, we commence another heap\r\nalongside. In doing this, our plan is to clean out some of the\r\nsheep-sheds or pig-pens, where the manure has accumulated for some time.\r\nThis gives us much more than the daily supply. Place this manure on the\r\noutside of the new heap, and then take a quantity of hot, fermenting,\r\nmanure from the middle of the old heap, and throw it into the center of\r\nthe new heap, and then cover it up with the fresh manure. I would put in\r\neight or ten bushels, or as much as will warm up the center of the new\r\nheap, and start fermentation. The colder the weather, the more of this\r\nhot manure should you take from the old heap--the more the better. Fresh\r\nmanure should be added to the old heap to fill up the hole made by the\r\nremoval of the hot manure.\r\n\r\n“You draw out a great many loads of manure during the winter,” said the\r\nDeacon, “and pile it in the field, and I have always thought it a good\r\nplan, as you do the work when there is little else to do, and when the\r\nground is frozen.”\r\n\r\nYes, this is an improvement on my old plan. I formerly used to turn over\r\nthe heap of manure in the barn-yard in March, or as soon as fermentation\r\nhad ceased.\r\n\r\nThe object of turning the heap is (1st,) to mix the manure and make it\r\nof uniform quality; (2d,) to break the lumps and make the manure fine;\r\nand (3d,) to lighten up the manure and make it loose, thus letting in\r\nthe air and inducing a second fermentation. It is a good plan, and well\r\nrepays for the labor. In doing the work, build up the end and sides of\r\nthe new heap straight, and keep the top flat. Have an eye on the man\r\ndoing the work, and see that he breaks up the manure and mixes it\r\nthoroughly, and that he _goes to the bottom of the heap_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy new plan that the Deacon alludes to, is, instead of turning the heap\r\nin the yard, to draw the manure from the heap in the yard, and pile it\r\nup in another heap in the field where it is to be used. This has all the\r\neffects of turning, and at the same time saves a good deal of team-work\r\nin the spring.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _A, B, Manure Heaps; C, D, E, Ridges, 2½ ft. apart._]\r\n\r\nThe location of the manure-heap in the field deserves some\r\nconsideration. If the manure is to be used for root-crops or potatoes,\r\nand if the land is to be ridged, and the manure put in the ridges, then\r\nit will be desirable to put the heap on the headland, or, better still,\r\nto make two heaps, one on the headland top of the field, and the other\r\non the headland at the bottom of the field, as shown in the annexed\r\nengraving.\r\n\r\nWe draw the manure with a cart, the horse walking between two of the\r\nridges (D), and the wheels of the cart going in C and E. The manure is\r\npulled out at the back end of the cart into small heaps, about five\r\npaces apart.\r\n\r\n“That is what I object to with you agricultural writers,” said the\r\nDoctor; “you say ‘about five paces,’ and sometimes ‘about five paces’\r\nwould mean 4 yards, and sometimes 6 yards; and if you put 10 tons of\r\nmanure per acre in the one case, you would put 15 tons in the\r\nother--which makes quite a difference in the dose.”\r\n\r\nThe Doctor is right. Let us figure a little. If your cart holds 20\r\nbushels, and if the manure weighs 75 lbs. to the bushel, and you wish to\r\nput on 10 tons of manure per acre, or 1,500 bushels, or 13⅓ cart-loads,\r\nthen, as there are 43,560 square feet in an acre, you want a bushel of\r\nmanure to 29 square feet, or say a space 2 yards long, by nearly 5 feet\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nNow, as our ridges are 2½ feet apart, and as our usual plan is to manure\r\n5 ridges at a time, or 12½ feet wide, a load of 20 bushels of manure\r\nwill go over a space 46½ feet long, nearly, or say 15½ yards; and so,\r\na load would make 3 heaps, 15½ feet apart, and there would be 6⅔ bushels\r\nin each heap.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the manure is to be spread on the surface of the land, there is no\r\nnecessity for placing the heap on the headland. You can make the heap or\r\nheaps. --“Where most convenient,” broke in the Deacon. --“No, not by any\r\nmeans,” I replied; “for if that was the rule, the men would certainly\r\nput the heap just where it happened to be the least trouble for them to\r\ndraw and throw off the loads.”\r\n\r\nThe aim should be to put the heap just where it will require the least\r\nlabor to draw the manure on to the land in the spring.\r\n\r\nOn what we call “rolling,” or hilly land, I would put the heap on the\r\nhighest land, so that in the spring the horses would be going down hill\r\nwith the full carts or wagons. Of course, it would be very unwise to\r\nadopt this plan if the manure was not drawn from the yards until spring,\r\nwhen the land was soft; but I am now speaking of drawing out the manure\r\nin the winter, when there is sleighing, or when the ground is frozen. No\r\nfarmer will object to a little extra labor for the teams in the winter,\r\nif it will save work and time in the spring.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Field, 40×20 Rods, showing Position of two Heaps of\r\n  Manure, a, a._]\r\n\r\nIf the land is level, then the heap or heaps should be placed where the\r\nleast distance will have to be traveled in drawing the manure from the\r\nheap to the land. If there is only one heap, the best point would be in\r\nthe center of the field. If two heaps, and the field is longer than it\r\nis broad, say 20 rods wide, and 40 rods long, then the heaps should be\r\nmade as shown on the previous page.\r\n\r\nIf the field is square, say 40 × 40 rods, and we can have four heaps of\r\nmanure, then, other things being equal, the best points for the heaps\r\nare shown in the annexed figure:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Field, 40×40 Rods, showing Position of four Heaps of\r\n  Manure, a, a, a, a._]\r\n\r\nHaving determined where to make the heaps, the next question is in\r\nregard to size. We make one about 8 feet wide and 6 feet high, the\r\nlength being determined by the quantity of the manure we have to draw.\r\nIn cold weather, it is well to finish the heap each day as far as you\r\ngo, so that the sloping side at the end of the heap will not be frozen\r\nduring the night. Build up the sides square, so that the top of the heap\r\nshall be as broad as the bottom. You will have to see that this is done,\r\nfor the average farm-man, if left to himself, will certainly narrow up\r\nthe heap like the roof of a house. The reason he does this is that he\r\nthrows the manure from the load into the center of the heap, and he can\r\nnot build up the sides straight and square without getting on to the\r\nheap occasionally, and placing a layer round the outsides. He should be\r\ninstructed, too, to break up the lumps, and mix the manure, working it\r\nover until it is loose and fine. It there are any frozen masses of\r\nmanure, place them on the east or south outside, and not in the middle\r\nof the heap.\r\n\r\nIf there is any manure in the sheds, or basements, or cellars, or\r\npig-pens, clean it out, and draw it at once to the pile in the field,\r\nand mix it with the manure you are drawing from the heap in the yard.\r\n\r\nWe generally draw with two teams and three wagons. We have one man to\r\nfill the wagon in the yard, and two men to drive and unload. When the\r\nman comes back from the field, he places his empty wagon by the side of\r\nthe heap in the yard, and takes off the horses and puts them to the\r\nloaded wagon, and drives to the heap in the field. If we have men and\r\nteams enough, we draw with three teams and three wagons. In this case,\r\nwe put a reliable man at the heap, who helps the driver to unload, and\r\nsees that the heap is built properly. The driver helps the man in the\r\nyard to load up. In the former plan, we have two teams and three men; in\r\nthe latter case, we have three teams and five men, and as we have two\r\nmen loading and unloading, instead of one, we ought to draw out double\r\nthe quantity of manure in a day. If the weather is cold and windy, we\r\nput the blankets on the horses under the harness, so that they will not\r\nbe chilled while standing at the heap in the yard or field. They will\r\ntrot back lively with the empty wagon or sleigh, and the work will\r\nproceed briskly, and the manure be less exposed to the cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n“You do not,” said the Doctor, “draw the manure on to the heap with a\r\ncart, and dump it, as I have seen it done in England?”\r\n\r\nI did so a few years ago, and might do so again if I was piling manure\r\nin the spring, to be kept over summer for use in the fall. The\r\ncompression caused by drawing the cart over the manure, has a tendency\r\nto exclude the air and thus retard fermentation. In the winter there is\r\ncertainly no necessity for resorting to any means for checking\r\nfermentation. In the spring or summer it may be well to compress the\r\nheap a little, but not more, I think, than can be done by the trampling\r\nof the workman in spreading the manure on the heap.\r\n\r\n\r\n“You do not,” said the Doctor, “adopt the old-fashioned English plan of\r\nkeeping your manure in a basin in the barn-yard, and yet I should think\r\nit has some advantages.”\r\n\r\n“I practised it here,” said I, “for some years. I plowed and scraped a\r\nlarge hole or basin in the yard four or five feet deep, with a gradual\r\nslope at one end for convenience in drawing out the loads--the other\r\nsides being much steeper. I also made a tank at the bottom to hold the\r\ndrainage, and had a pump in it to pump the liquid back on to the heap in\r\ndry weather. We threw or wheeled the manure from the stables and\r\npig-pens into this basin, but I did not like the plan, for two reasons:\r\n(1,) the manure being spread over so large a surface froze during\r\nwinter, and (2,) during the spring there was so much water in the basin\r\nthat it checked fermentation.”\r\n\r\nNow, instead of spreading it all over the basin, we commenced a small\r\nheap on one of the sloping sides of the basin; with a horse and cart we\r\ndrew to this heap, just as winter set in, every bit of manure that could\r\nbe found on the premises, and everything that would make manure. When\r\ngot all together, it made a heap seven or eight feet wide, twenty feet\r\nlong, and three or four feet high. We then laid planks on the heap, and\r\nevery day, as the pig-pens, cow and horse stables were cleaned out, the\r\nmanure was wheeled on to the heap and shaken out and spread about. The\r\nheap soon commenced to ferment, and when the cold weather set in,\r\nalthough the sides and some parts of the top froze a little, the inside\r\nkept quite warm. Little chimneys were formed in the heap, where the heat\r\nand steam escaped. Other parts of the heap would be covered with a thin\r\ncrust of frozen manure. By taking a few forkfuls of the latter, and\r\nplacing them on the top of the “chimneys,” they checked the escape of\r\nsteam, and had a tendency to distribute the heat to other parts of the\r\nheap. In this way the fermentation became more general throughout all\r\nthe mass, and not so violent at any one spot.\r\n\r\n“But why be at all this trouble?”--For several reasons. First. It saves\r\nlabor in the end. Two hours’ work, in winter, will save three hours’\r\nwork in the spring. And three hours’ work in the spring is worth more\r\nthan four hours’ work in the winter. So that we save half the expense of\r\nhandling the manure. 2d. When manure is allowed to lie scattered about\r\nover a large surface, it is liable to have much of its value washed out\r\nby the rain. In a compact heap of this kind, the rain or snow that falls\r\non it is not more than the manure needs to keep it moist enough for\r\nfermentation. 3d. There is as much fascination in this fermenting heap\r\nof manure as there is in having money in a savings bank. One is\r\ncontinually trying to add to it. Many a cart-load or wheel-barrowful of\r\nmaterial will be deposited that would otherwise be allowed to run to\r\nwaste. 4th. The manure, if turned over in February or March, will be in\r\ncapital order for applying to root crops; or if your hay and straw\r\ncontains weed-seeds, the manure will be in good condition to spread as a\r\ntop-dressing on grass-land early in the spring. This, I think, is better\r\nthan keeping it in the yards all summer, and then drawing it out on the\r\ngrass land in September. You gain six months’ or a year’s time. You get\r\na splendid growth of rich grass, and the red-root seeds will germinate\r\nnext September just as well as if the manure was drawn out at that time.\r\nIf the manure is drawn out early in the spring, and spread out\r\nimmediately, and then harrowed two or three times with a Thomas’\r\nsmoothing-harrow, there is no danger of its imparting a rank flavor to\r\nthe grass. I know from repeated trials that when part of a pasture is\r\ntop-dressed, cows and sheep will keep it much more closely cropped down\r\nthan the part which has not been manured. The idea to the contrary\r\noriginated from not spreading the manure evenly.\r\n\r\n“But why ferment the manure at all? Why not draw it out fresh from the\r\nyards? Does fermentation increase the amount of plant-food in the\r\nmanure?”--No. But it renders the plant-food in the manure more\r\nimmediately available. It makes it more soluble. We ferment manure for\r\nthe same reason that we decompose bone-dust or mineral phosphates with\r\nsulphuric acid, and convert them into superphosphate, or for the same\r\nreason that we grind our corn and cook the meal. These processes add\r\nnothing to the amount of plant-food in the bones or the nutriment in the\r\ncorn. They only increase its availability. So in fermenting manure. When\r\nthe liquid and solid excrements from well-fed animals, with the straw\r\nnecessary to absorb the liquid, are placed in a heap, fermentation sets\r\nin and soon effects very important changes in the nature and composition\r\nof the materials. The insoluble woody fibre of the straw is decomposed\r\nand converted into humic and ulmic acids. These are insoluble; and when\r\nmanure consists almost wholly of straw or corn stalks, there would be\r\nlittle gained by fermenting it. But when there is a good proportion of\r\nmanure from well fed animals in the heap, carbonate of ammonia is formed\r\nfrom the nitrogenous compounds in the manure, and this ammonia unites\r\nwith the humic and ulmic acids and forms humate and ulmate of ammonia.\r\nThese ammoniacal salts are soluble in water--as the brown color of the\r\ndrainings of a manure heap sufficiently indicates.\r\n\r\nProperly fermented manure, therefore, of good quality, is a much more\r\nactive and immediately useful fertilizer than fresh, unfermented manure.\r\nThere need be no loss of ammonia from evaporation, and the manure is far\r\nless bulky, and costs far less labor to draw out and spread. The only\r\nloss that is likely to occur is from leaching, and this must be\r\nspecially guarded against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE MANAGEMENT OF MANURES.--Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY DO WE FERMENT MANURE?\r\n\r\nHowever much farmers may differ in regard to the advantages or\r\ndisadvantages of fermenting manure, I have never met with one who\r\ncontended that it was good, either in theory or practice, to leave\r\nmanure for months, scattered over a barn-yard, exposed to the spring and\r\nautumn rains, and to the summer’s sun and wind. All admit that, if it is\r\nnecessary to leave manure in the yards, it should be either thrown into\r\na basin, or put into a pile or heap, where it will be compact, and not\r\nmuch exposed.\r\n\r\nWe did not need the experiments of Dr. Vœlcker to convince us that there\r\nwas great waste in leaving manure exposed to the leaching action of our\r\nheavy rains. We did not know exactly how much we lost, but we knew it\r\nmust be considerable. No one advocates the practice of exposing manure,\r\nand it is of no use to discuss the matter. All will admit that it is\r\nunwise and wasteful to allow manure to lie scattered and exposed over\r\nthe barn-yards any longer than is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nWe should either draw it directly to the field and use it, or we should\r\nmake it into a compact heap, where it will not receive more rain than is\r\nneeded to keep it moist.\r\n\r\nOne reason for piling manure, therefore, is to preserve it from loss,\r\nuntil we wish to use it on the land.\r\n\r\n“We all admit that,” said the Deacon, “but is there anything actually\r\ngained by fermenting it in the heap?”--In one sense, no; but in another,\r\nand very important sense, yes. When we cook corn-meal for our little\r\npigs, we add nothing to it. We have no more meal after it is cooked than\r\nbefore. There are no more starch, or oil, or nitrogenous matters in the\r\nmeal, but we think the pigs can digest the food more readily. And so, in\r\nfermenting manure, we add nothing to it; there is no more actual\r\nnitrogen, or phosphoric acid, or potash, or any other ingredient after\r\nfermentation than there was before, but these ingredients are rendered\r\nmore soluble, and can be more rapidly taken up by the plants. In this\r\nsense, therefore, there is a great gain.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, we do not, in many cases, get anything like as\r\nmuch benefit from our manure as the ingredients it contains would lead\r\nus to expect.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawes, on his clayey soil at Rothamsted, England, has grown over\r\nthirty crops of wheat, year after year, on the same land. One plot has\r\nreceived 14 tons of barn-yard manure per acre every year, and yet the\r\nproduce from this plot is no larger, and, in fact, is frequently much\r\nless, than from a few hundred pounds of artificial manure containing far\r\nless nitrogen.\r\n\r\nFor nineteen years, 1852 to 1870, some of the plots have received the\r\nsame manure year after year. The following shows the _average_ yield for\r\nthe nineteen years:\r\n                                              _Wheat       _Straw\r\n                                              per acre._   per acre._\r\n  Plot 5.--Mixed mineral manure, alone         17 bus.      15 cwt.\r\n    ”  6.--Mixed mineral manure, and 200\r\n             lbs. ammoniacal salts             27 bus.      25 cwt.\r\n    ”  7.--Mixed mineral manure, and 400\r\n             lbs. ammoniacal salts             36 bus.      36 cwt.\r\n    ”  9.--Mixed mineral manure, and 550\r\n             lbs. nitrate of soda              37 bus.      41 cwt.\r\n    ”  2.--14 tons farm-yard dung              36 bus.      34 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe 14 tons (31,360 lbs.) of farm-yard manure contained about 8,540 lbs.\r\norganic matter, 868 lbs. mineral matter, and 200 lbs. nitrogen. The 400\r\nlbs. of ammoniacal salts, and the 550 lbs. nitrate of soda, each\r\ncontained 82 lbs. of nitrogen; and it will be seen that this 82 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen produced as great an effect as the 200 lbs. of nitrogen in\r\nbarn-yard manure.\r\n\r\nSimilar experiments have been made on barley, with even more striking\r\nresults. The plot dressed with 300 lbs. superphosphate of lime, and 200\r\nlbs. ammoniacal salts per acre, produced as large a crop as 14 tons of\r\nfarm-yard manure. The average yield of barley for nineteen crops grown\r\non the same land each year was 48 bus. and 28 cwt. of straw per acre on\r\nboth plots. In other words, 41 lbs. of nitrogen, in ammoniacal salts,\r\nproduced as great an effect as 200 lbs. of nitrogen in farm-yard manure!\r\nDuring the nineteen years, one plot had received 162,260 lbs. of organic\r\nmatter, 16,492 lbs. of mineral matter, and 3,800 lbs. of nitrogen; while\r\nthe other had received only 5,700 lbs. mineral matter, and 779 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen--and yet one has produced as large a crop as the other.\r\n\r\nWhy this difference? It will not do to say that more nitrogen was\r\napplied in the farm-yard manure than was needed. Mr. Lawes says: “For\r\nsome years, an amount of ammonia-salts, containing 82 lbs. of nitrogen,\r\nwas applied to one series of plots (of barley), but this was found to be\r\ntoo much, the crop generally being too heavy and laid. Yet probably\r\nabout 200 lbs. of nitrogen was annually supplied in the dung, but with\r\nit there was no over-luxuriance, and no more crop, than where 41 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen was supplied in the form of ammonia or nitric acid.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem that there can be but one explanation of these\r\naccurately-ascertained facts. The nitrogenous matter in the manure is\r\nnot in an available condition. It is in the manure, but the plants can\r\nnot take it up until it is decomposed and rendered soluble. Dr. Vœlcker\r\nanalyzed “perfectly fresh horse-dung,” and found that of _free_ ammonia\r\nthere was not more than one pound in 15 tons! And yet these 15 tons\r\ncontained nitrogen enough to furnish 140 lbs. of ammonia.\r\n\r\n“But,” it may be asked, “will not this fresh manure decompose in the\r\nsoil, and furnish ammonia?” In light, sandy soil, I presume it will do\r\nso to a considerable extent. We know that clay mixed with manure retards\r\nfermentation, but sand mixed with manure accelerates fermentation. This,\r\nat any rate, is the case when sand is added in small quantities to a\r\nheap of fermenting manure. But I do not suppose it would have the same\r\neffect when a small quantity of manure is mixed with a large amount of\r\nsand, as is the case when manure is applied to land, and plowed under.\r\nAt any rate, practical farmers, with almost entire unanimity, think\r\nwell-rotted manure is better for sandy land than fresh manure.\r\n\r\nAs to how rapidly, or rather how slowly, manure decomposes in a rather\r\nheavy loamy soil, the above experiments of Mr. Lawes afford very\r\nconclusive, but at the same time very discouraging evidence. During the\r\n19 years, 3,800 lbs. of nitrogen, and 16,492 lbs. of mineral matter, in\r\nthe form of farm-yard manure, were applied to an acre of land, and the\r\n19 crops of barley in grain and straw removed only 3,724 lbs. of mineral\r\nmatter, and 1,064 lbs. of nitrogen. The soil now contains, unless it has\r\ndrained away, 1,736 lbs. more nitrogen per acre than it did when the\r\nexperiments commenced. And yet 41 lbs. of nitrogen in an _available\r\ncondition_ is sufficient to produce a good large crop of barley, and 82\r\nlbs. per acre furnished more than the plants could organize.\r\n\r\n“Those are very interesting experiments,” said the Doctor, “and show why\r\nit is that our farmers can afford to pay a higher price for nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid in superphosphate, and other artificial manures, than\r\nfor the same amount of nitrogen and phosphoric acid in stable-manure.”\r\n\r\nWe will not discuss this point at present. What I want to ascertain is,\r\nwhether we can not find some method of making our farm-yard manure more\r\nreadily available. Piling it up, and letting it ferment, is one method\r\nof doing this, though I think other methods will yet be discovered.\r\nPossibly it will be found that spreading well-rotted manure on the\r\nsurface of the land will be one of the most practical and simplest\r\nmethods of accomplishing this object.\r\n\r\n“We pile the manure, therefore,” said Charley, “first, because we do not\r\nwish it to lie exposed to the rain in the yards, and, second, because\r\nfermenting it in the heap renders it more soluble, and otherwise more\r\navailable for the crops, when applied to the land.”\r\n\r\nThat is it exactly, and another reason for piling manure is, that the\r\nfermentation greatly reduces its bulk, and we have less labor to perform\r\nin drawing it out and spreading it. Ellwanger & Barry, who draw several\r\nthousand loads of stable-manure every year, and pile it up to ferment,\r\ntell me that it takes three loads of fresh manure to make one load of\r\nrotted manure. This, of course, has reference to bulk, and not weight.\r\nThree tons of fresh barn-yard manure, according to the experiments of\r\nDr. Vœlcker, will make about two tons when well rotted. Even this is a\r\ngreat saving of labor, and the rotted manure can be more easily spread,\r\nand mixed more thoroughly with the soil--a point of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Another reason for fermenting manure,” said the Squire, “is the\r\ndestruction of weed-seeds.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” said I, “and a very important reason; but I try not to\r\nthink about this method of killing weed-seeds. It is a great deal better\r\nto kill the weeds. There can be no doubt that a fermenting manure-heap\r\nwill kill many of the weed-seeds, but enough will usually escape to\r\nre-seed the land.”\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate, however, that the best means to kill weed-seeds in the\r\nmanure, are also the best for rendering the manure most efficient. I was\r\ntalking to John Johnston on this subject a few days ago. He told me how\r\nhe piled manure in his yards.\r\n\r\n“I commence,” he said, “where the heap is intended to be, and throw the\r\nmanure on one side, until the bare ground is reached.”\r\n\r\n“What is the use of that?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“If you do not do so,” he replied, “there will be some portion of the\r\nmanure under the heap that will be so compact that it will not ferment,\r\nand the weed-seeds will not be killed.”\r\n\r\n“You think,” said I, “that weed-seeds can be killed in this way?”\r\n\r\n“I know they can,” he replied, “but the heap must be carefully made, so\r\nthat it will ferment evenly, and when the pile is turned, the bottom and\r\nsides should be thrown into the center of the heap.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF AMMONIA BY FERMENTING MANURE.\r\n\r\nIf you throw a quantity of fresh horse-manure into a loose heap,\r\nfermentation proceeds with great rapidity. Much heat is produced, and if\r\nthe manure is under cover, or there is not rain enough to keep the heap\r\nmoist, the manure will “fire-fang” and a large proportion of the\r\ncarbonate of ammonia produced by the fermentation will escape into the\r\natmosphere and be lost.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, we use our horse-manure for bedding the store and\r\nfattening pigs. We throw the manure every morning and evening, when the\r\nstable is cleaned out, into an empty stall near the door of the stable,\r\nand there it remains until wanted to bed the pigs. We find it is\r\nnecessary to remove it frequently, especially in the summer, as\r\nfermentation soon sets in, and the escape of the ammonia is detected by\r\nits well known pungent smell. Throw this manure into the pig-cellar and\r\nlet the pigs trample it down, and there is no longer any escape of\r\nammonia. At any rate, I have never perceived any. Litmus paper will\r\ndetect ammonia in an atmosphere containing only one seventy-five\r\nthousandth part of it; and, as Prof. S. W. Johnson once remarked, “It is\r\ncertain that a healthy nose is not far inferior in delicacy to litmus\r\npaper.” I feel sure that no ammonia escapes from this horse-manure after\r\nit is trampled down by the pigs, although it contains an additional\r\nquantity of “potential ammonia” from the liquid and solid droppings of\r\nthese animals.\r\n\r\nWater has a strong attraction for ammonia. One gallon of ice-cold water\r\nwill absorb 1,150 gallons of ammonia.\r\n\r\nIf the manure, therefore, is moderately moist, the ammonia is not likely\r\nto escape. Furthermore, as Dr. Vœlcker has shown us, during the\r\nfermentation of the manure in a heap, ulmic and humic, crenic and\r\napocrenic acids are produced, and these unite with the ammonia and “fix”\r\nit--in other words, they change it from a volatile gas into a\r\nnon-volatile salt.\r\n\r\nIf the heap of manure, therefore, is moist enough and large enough, all\r\nthe evidence goes to show, that there is little or no loss of ammonia.\r\nIf the centre of the heap gets so hot and so dry that the ammonia is not\r\nretained, there is still no necessity for loss.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the heap are cool and moist, and will retain the carbonate\r\nof ammonia, the acids mentioned also coming into play.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia is much more likely to escape from the top of the heap than\r\nfrom the sides. The heat and steam form little chimneys, and when a\r\nfermenting manure-heap is covered with snow, these little chimneys are\r\nreadily seen. If you think the manure is fermenting too rapidly, and\r\nthat the ammonia is escaping, trample the manure down firmly about the\r\nchimneys, thus closing them up, and if need be, or if convenient, throw\r\nmore manure on top, or throw on a few pailfuls of water.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan, too, where convenient, to cover the heap with soil.\r\nI sometimes do this when piling manure in the field, not from fear of\r\nlosing ammonia, but in order to retain moisture in the heap. With proper\r\nprecautions, I think we may safely dismiss the idea of any serious loss\r\nof ammonia from fermenting manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WASTE OF MANURE FROM LEACHING.\r\n\r\nAs we have endeavored to show, there is little danger of losing ammonia\r\nby keeping and fermenting manure. But this is not the only question to\r\nbe considered. We have seen that in 10,000 lbs. of fresh farm-yard\r\nmanure, there is about 64 lbs. of nitrogen. Of this, about 15 lbs. are\r\nsoluble, and 49 lbs. insoluble. Of mineral matter, we have in this\r\nquantity of manure, 559 lbs., of which 154 lbs. are soluble in water,\r\nand 405 lbs. insoluble. If we had a heap of five tons of fermenting\r\nmanure in a stable, the escape of half an ounce of carbonate of ammonia\r\nwould make a tremendous smell, and we should at once use means to check\r\nthe escape of this precious substance. But it will be seen that we have\r\nin this five tons of fresh manure, nitrogenous matter, capable of\r\nforming over 180 lbs. of carbonate of ammonia, over 42 lbs. of which is\r\nin a soluble condition. This may be leached day after day, slowly and\r\nimperceptibly, with no heat, or smell, to attract attention.\r\n\r\nHow often do we see manure lying under the eaves of an unspouted shed or\r\nbarn, where one of our heavy showers will saturate it in a few minutes,\r\nand yet where it will lie for hours, and days, and weeks, until it would\r\nseem that a large proportion of its soluble matter would be washed out\r\nof it! The loss is unquestionably very great, and would be greater if it\r\nwere not for the coarse nature of the material, which allows the water\r\nto pass through it rapidly and without coming in direct contact with\r\nonly the outside portions of the particles of hay, straw, etc., of which\r\nthe manure is largely composed. If the manure was ground up very fine,\r\nas it would be when prepared for analysis, the loss of soluble matter\r\nwould be still more serious. Or, if the manure was first fermented, so\r\nthat the particles of matter would be more or less decomposed and broken\r\nup fine, the rain would wash out a large amount of soluble matter, and\r\nprove much more injurious than if the manure was fresh and unfermented.\r\n\r\n“That is an argument,” said the Deacon, “against your plan of piling and\r\nfermenting manure.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” I replied; “it is a strong reason for not letting manure\r\nlie under the eaves of an unspouted building--especially _good_ manure,\r\nthat is made from rich food. The better the manure, the more it will\r\nlose from bad management. I have never recommended any one to pile their\r\nmanure where it would receive from ten to twenty times as much water as\r\nwould fall on the surface of the heap.”\r\n\r\n“But you do recommend piling manure and fermenting it in the open air\r\nand keeping the top flat, so that it will catch all the rain, and I\r\nthink your heaps must sometimes get pretty well soaked.”\r\n\r\n“Soaking the heap of manure,” I replied, “does not wash out any of its\r\nsoluble matter, _provided_ you carry the matter no further than the\r\npoint of saturation. The water may, and doubtless does, wash out the\r\nsoluble matter from some portions of the manure, but if the water does\r\nnot filter through the heap, but is all absorbed by the manure, there is\r\nno loss. It is when the water passes through the heap that it runs away\r\nwith our soluble nitrogenous and mineral matter, and with any ready\r\nformed ammonia it may find in the manure.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to keep cows tied up in the barn, and at the same time save all the\r\nurine, is one of the most difficult problems I have to deal with in the\r\nmanagement of manure on my farm. The best plan I have yet tried is, to\r\nthrow horse-manure, or sheep-manure, back of the cows, where it will\r\nreceive and absorb the urine. The plan works well, but it is a question\r\nof labor, and the answer will depend on the arrangement of the\r\nbuildings. If the horses are kept near the cows, it will be little\r\ntrouble to throw the horse-litter, every day, under or back of the cows.\r\n\r\nIn my own case, my cows are kept in a basement, with a tight barn-floor\r\noverhead. When this barn-floor is occupied with sheep, we keep them\r\nwell-bedded with straw, and it is an easy matter to throw this soiled\r\nbedding down to the cow-stable below, where it is used to absorb the\r\nurine of the cows, and is then wheeled out to the manure-heap in the\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nAt other times, we use dry earth as an absorbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nMANURE ON DAIRY-FARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarms devoted principally to dairying ought to be richer and more\r\nproductive than farms largely devoted to the production of grain.\r\n\r\nNearly all the produce of the farm is used to feed the cows, and little\r\nis sold but milk, or cheese, or butter.\r\n\r\nWhen butter alone is sold, there ought to be no loss of fertilizing\r\nmatter--as pure butter or oil contains no nitrogen, phosphoric acid, or\r\npotash. It contains nothing but carbonaceous matter, which can be\r\nremoved from the farm without detriment.\r\n\r\nAnd even in the case of milk, or cheese, the advantage is all on the\r\nside of the dairyman, as compared with the grain-grower. A dollar’s\r\nworth of milk or cheese removes far less nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and\r\npotash, than a dollar’s worth of wheat or other grain. Five hundred lbs.\r\nof cheese contains about 25 lbs. of nitrogen, and 20 lbs. of mineral\r\nmatter. A cow that would make this amount of cheese would eat not less\r\nthan six tons of hay, or its equivalent in grass or grain, in a year.\r\nAnd this amount of food, supposing it to be half clover and half\r\nordinary meadow-hay, would contain 240 lbs. of nitrogen and 810 lbs. of\r\nmineral matter. In other words, a cow eats 240 lbs. of nitrogen, and 25\r\nlbs. are removed in the cheese, or not quite 10½ per cent, and of\r\nmineral matter not quite 2½ per cent is removed. If it takes three acres\r\nto produce this amount of food, there will be 8⅓ lbs. of nitrogen\r\nremoved by the cheese, per acre, while 30 bushels of wheat would remove\r\nin the grain 32 lbs. of nitrogen, and 10 to 15 lbs. in the straw. So\r\nthat a crop of wheat removes from five to six times as much nitrogen per\r\nacre as a crop of cheese; and the removal of mineral matter in cheese is\r\nquite insignificant as compared with the amount removed in a crop of\r\nwheat or corn. If our grain-growing farmers can keep up the fertility of\r\ntheir land, as they undoubtedly can, the dairymen ought to be making\r\ntheirs richer and more productive every year.\r\n\r\n“All that is quite true,” said the Doctor, “and yet from what I have\r\nseen and heard, the farms in the dairy districts, do not, as a rule,\r\nshow any rapid improvement. In fact, we hear it often alleged that the\r\nsoil is becoming exhausted of phosphates, and that the quantity and\r\nquality of the grass is deteriorating.”\r\n\r\n“There may be some truth in this,” said I, “and yet I will hazard the\r\nprediction that in no other branch of agriculture shall we witness a\r\nmore decided improvement during the next twenty-five years than on farms\r\nlargely devoted to the dairy. Grain-growing farmers, like our friend the\r\nDeacon, here, who sells his grain and never brings home a load of\r\nmanure, and rarely buys even a ton of bran to feed to stock, and who\r\nsells more or less hay, must certainly be impoverishing their soils of\r\nphosphates much more rapidly than the dairyman who consumes nearly all\r\nhis produce on the farm, and sells little except milk, butter, cheese,\r\nyoung calves, and old cows.”\r\n\r\n“Bones had a wonderful effect,” said the Doctor, “on the old pastures in\r\nthe dairy district of Cheshire in England.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” I replied, “and so they will here, and so would\r\nwell-rotted manure. There is nothing in this fact to prove that dairying\r\nspecially robs the soil of phosphates. It is not phosphates that the\r\ndairyman needs so much as richer manure.”\r\n\r\n“What would you add to the manure to make it richer?” asked the Doctor.\r\n\r\n“Nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“But how?” asked the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said the Doctor, “by buying guano and the German potash\r\nsalts.”\r\n\r\n“That would be a good plan,” said I; “but I would do it by buying bran,\r\nmill-feed, brewer’s-grains, malt-combs, corn-meal, oil-cake, or whatever\r\nwas best and cheapest in proportion to value. Bran or mill-feed can\r\noften be bought at a price at which it will pay to use it freely for\r\nmanure. A few tons of bran worked into a pile of cow-dung would warm it\r\nup and add considerably to its value. It would supply the nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, and potash, in which ordinary manure is deficient. In\r\nshort, it would convert poor manure into rich manure.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” exclaimed the Deacon, “I knew you talked of mixing\r\ndried-blood and bone-dust with your manure, but I did not think you\r\nwould advocate anything quite so extravagant as taking good, wholesome\r\nbran and spout-feed and throwing it on to your manure-pile.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Deacon,” said I, “we do it every day. I am putting about a ton of\r\nspout-feed, malt-combs and corn-meal each week into my manure-pile, and\r\nthat is the reason why it ferments so readily even in the winter. It\r\nconverts my poor manure into good, rich, well-decomposed dung, one load\r\nof which is worth three loads of your long, strawy manure.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not wet it and let it ferment before putting it in the pile?”\r\n\r\n“No, Deacon,” said I, “I feed the bran, malt-combs and corn-meal to the\r\ncows, pigs, and sheep, and let them do the mixing. They work it up fine,\r\nmoisten it, break up the particles, take out the carbonaceous matter,\r\nwhich we do not need for manure, and the cows and sheep and horses mix\r\nit up thoroughly with the hay, straw, and corn-stalks, leaving the whole\r\nin just the right condition to put into a pile to ferment or to apply\r\ndirectly to the land.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I see,” said the Deacon, “I did not think you used bran for\r\nmanure.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do, Deacon,” said I, “but I use it for food _first_, and this is\r\nprecisely what I would urge you and all others to do. I feel sure that\r\nour dairymen can well afford to buy more mill-feed, corn-meal, oil-cake,\r\netc., and mix it with their cow-dung--or rather, let the cows do the\r\nmixing.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM THE HON. HARRIS LEWIS.\r\n\r\nI wrote to the Hon. Harris Lewis, the well-known dairyman of Herkimer\r\nCo., N.Y., asking him some questions in regard to making and managing\r\nmanure on dairy farms. The questions will be understood from the\r\nanswers. He writes as follows:\r\n\r\n“My Friend Harris.--This being the first leisure time I have had since\r\nthe receipt of your last letter, I devote it to answering your\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n“1st. I have no manure cellar.\r\n\r\n“I bed my cows with dry basswood sawdust, saving all the liquid manure,\r\nkeeping the cows clean, and the stable odors down to a tolerable degree.\r\nThis bedding breaks up the tenacity of the cow-manure, rendering it as\r\neasy to pulverize and manage as clear horse-manure. I would say it is\r\njust lovely to bed cows with dry basswood sawdust. This manure, if left\r\nin a large pile, will ferment and burn like horse-manure in about 10\r\ndays. Hence I draw it out as made where I desire to use it, leaving it\r\nin small heaps, convenient to spread.\r\n\r\n“My pigs and calves are bedded with straw, and this is piled and rotted\r\nbefore using.\r\n\r\n“I use most of my manure on grass land, and mangels, some on corn and\r\npotatoes; but it pays me best, when in proper condition, to apply all I\r\ndo not need for mangels, on meadow and pasture.\r\n\r\n“Forty loads, or about 18 to 20 cords is a homœopathic dose for an acre,\r\nand this quantity, or more, applied once in three years to grass land,\r\nagrees with it first rate.\r\n\r\n“The land where I grow mangels gets about this dose every year.\r\n\r\n“I would say that my up-land meadows have been mown twice each year for\r\na great many years.\r\n\r\n“I have been using refuse salt from Syracuse, on my mangels, at the rate\r\nof about six bushels per acre, applied broadcast in two applications. My\r\nhen-manure is pulverized, and sifted through a common coal sieve. The\r\nfine I use for dusting the mangels after they have been singled out, and\r\nthe lumps, if any, are used to warm up the red peppers.\r\n\r\n“I have sometimes mixed my hen-manure with dry muck, in the proportion\r\nof one bushel of hen-manure to 10 of muck, and received a profit from it\r\ntoo big to tell of, on corn, and on mangels.\r\n\r\n“I have sprinkled the refuse salt on my cow-stable floors sometimes, but\r\nwhere all the liquid is saved, I think we have salt enough for most\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n“I have abandoned the use of plaster on my pastures for the reason that\r\nmilk produced on green-clover is not so good as that produced on the\r\ngrasses proper. I use all the wood ashes I can get, on my mangels as a\r\nduster, and consider their value greater than the burners do who sell\r\nthem to me for 15 cts. a bushel. I have never used much lime, and have\r\nnot received the expected benefits from its use so far. But wood ashes\r\nagree with my land as well as manure does. The last question you ask,\r\nbut one, is this: ‘What is the usual plan of managing manure in the\r\ndairy districts?’ The usual method is to cut holes in the sides of the\r\nstable, about every ten feet along the whole length of the barn behind\r\nthe cows, and pitch the manure out through these holes, under the eaves\r\nof the barn, where it remains until too much in the way, when it is\r\ndrawn out and commonly applied to grass land in lumps as big as your\r\nhead. This practice is getting out of fashion a little now, but nearly\r\none-half of all the cow-manure made in Herkimer Co. is lost, wasted.\r\n\r\n“Your last question, ‘What improvement would you suggest,’ I answer by\r\nsaying it is of no use to make any to these men, it would be wasted like\r\ntheir manure.\r\n\r\n“The market value of manure in this county is 50 cts. per big load, or\r\nabout one dollar per cord.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“That is a capital letter,” said the Deacon. “It is right to the point,\r\nand no nonsense about it.”\r\n\r\n“He must make a good deal of manure,” said the Doctor, “to be able to\r\nuse 40 loads to the acre on his meadows and pastures once in three\r\nyears, and the same quantity every year on his field of mangel-wurzel.”\r\n\r\n“That is precisely what I have been contending for,” I replied; “the\r\ndairymen _can_ make large quantities of manure if they make an effort to\r\ndo it, and their farms ought to be constantly improving. Two crops of\r\nhay on the same meadow, each year, will enable a farmer to keep a large\r\nherd of cows, and make a great quantity of manure--and when you have\r\nonce got the manure, there is no difficulty in keeping up and increasing\r\nthe productiveness of the land.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE MORE AND BETTER MANURE ON DAIRY FARMS.\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said the Doctor, “in saying that there is no difficulty\r\nin keeping up and increasing the productiveness of our dairy farms, when\r\nyou have once got plenty of manure--but the difficulty is to get a good\r\nsupply of manure to start with.”\r\n\r\nThis is true, and it is comparatively slow work to bring up a farm,\r\nunless you have plenty of capital and can buy all the artificial manure\r\nyou want. By the free use of artificial manures, you could make a farm\r\nvery productive in one or two years. But the slower and cheaper method\r\nwill be the one adopted by most of our young and intelligent dairymen.\r\nFew of us are born with silver spoons in our mouths. We have to earn our\r\nmoney before we can spend it, and we are none the worse for the\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nSuppose a young man has a farm of 100 acres, devoted principally to\r\ndairying. Some of the land lies on a creek or river, while other\r\nportions are higher and drier. In the spring of the year, a stream of\r\nwater runs through a part of the farm from the adjoining hills down to\r\nthe creek or river. The farm now supports ten head of cows, three\r\nhorses, half a dozen sheep, and a few pigs. The land is worth $75 per\r\nacre, but does not pay the interest on half that sum. It is getting\r\nworse instead of better. Weeds are multiplying, and the more valuable\r\ngrasses are dying out. What is to be done?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let it be distinctly understood that the land is\r\n_not_ exhausted. As I have before said, the productiveness of a farm\r\ndoes not depend so much on the absolute amount of plant-food which the\r\nsoil contains, as on the amount of plant-food which is immediately\r\navailable for the use of the plants. An acre of land that produces half\r\na ton of hay, may contain as much plant-food as an acre that produces\r\nthree tons of hay. In the one case the plant-food is locked up in such a\r\nform that the crops cannot absorb it, while in the other it is in an\r\navailable condition. I have no doubt there are fields on the farm I am\r\nalluding to, that contain 3,000 lbs. of nitrogen, and an equal amount of\r\nphosphoric acid, per acre, in the first six inches of the surface soil.\r\nThis is as much nitrogen as is contained in 100 tons of meadow-hay, and\r\nmore phosphoric acid than is contained in 350 tons of meadow-hay. These\r\nare the two ingredients on which the fertility of our farms mainly\r\ndepend. And yet there are soils containing this quantity of plant-food\r\nthat do not produce more than half a ton of hay per acre.\r\n\r\nIn some fields, or parts of fields, the land is wet and the plants\r\ncannot take up the food, even while an abundance of it is within reach.\r\nThe remedy in this case is under-draining. On other fields, the\r\nplant-food is locked up in insoluble combinations. In this case we must\r\nplow up the soil, pulverize it, and expose it to the oxygen of the\r\natmosphere. We must treat the soil as my mother used to tell me to treat\r\nmy coffee, when I complained that it was not sweet enough. “I put plenty\r\nof sugar in,” she said, “and if you will stir it up, the coffee will be\r\nsweeter.” The sugar lay undissolved at the bottom of the cup; and so it\r\nis with many of our soils. There is plenty of plant-food in them, but it\r\nneeds stirring up. They contain, it may be, 3,000 lbs. of nitrogen, and\r\nother plant-food in still greater proportion, and we are only getting a\r\ncrop that contains 18 lbs. of nitrogen a year, and of this probably the\r\nrain supplies 9 lbs. Let us stir up the soil and see if we cannot set\r\n100 lbs. of this 3,000 lbs. of nitrogen free, and get three tons of hay\r\nper acre instead of half a ton. There are men who own a large amount of\r\nvaluable property in vacant city lots, who do not get enough from them\r\nto pay their taxes. If they would sell half of them, and put buildings\r\non the other half, they might soon have a handsome income. And so it is\r\nwith many farmers. They have the elements of 100 tons of hay lying\r\ndormant in every acre of their land, while they are content to receive\r\nhalf a ton a year. They have property enough, but it is unproductive,\r\nwhile they pay high taxes for the privilege of holding it, and high\r\nwages for the pleasure of boarding two or three hired men.\r\n\r\nWe have, say, 3,000 lbs. of nitrogen locked up in each acre of our soil,\r\nand we get 8 or 10 lbs. every year in rain and dew, and yet,\r\npractically, all that we want, to make our farms highly productive, is\r\n100 lbs. of nitrogen per acre per annum. And furthermore, it should be\r\nremembered, that to keep our farms rich, after we have once got them\r\nrich, it is not necessary to develope this amount of nitrogen from the\r\nsoil every year. In the case of clover-hay, the entire loss of nitrogen\r\nin the animal and in the milk would not exceed 15 per cent, so that,\r\nwhen we feed out 100 lbs. of nitrogen, we have 85 lbs. left in the\r\nmanure. We want to develope 100 lbs. of nitrogen in the soil, to enable\r\nus to raise a good crop to start with, and when this is once done, an\r\nannual development of 15 lbs. per acre in addition to the manure, would\r\nkeep up the productiveness of the soil. Is it not worth while,\r\ntherefore, to make an earnest effort to get started?--to get 100 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen in the most available condition in the soil?\r\n\r\nAs I said before, this is practically all that is needed to give us\r\nlarge crops. This amount of nitrogen represents about twelve tons of\r\naverage barn-yard manure--that is to say, twelve tons contains 100 lbs.\r\nof nitrogen. But in point of fact it is not in an immediately available\r\ncondition. It would probably take at least two years before all the\r\nnitrogen it contains would be given up to the plants. We want,\r\ntherefore, in order to give us a good start, 24 tons of barn-yard manure\r\non every acre of land. How to get this is the great problem which our\r\nyoung dairy farmer has to solve. In the grain-growing districts we get\r\nit in part by summer-fallowing, and I believe the dairyman might often\r\ndo the same thing with advantage. A thorough summer-fallow would not\r\nonly clean the land, but would render some of the latent plant-food\r\navailable. This will be organized in the next crop, and when the\r\ndairyman has once got the plant-food, he has decidedly the advantage\r\nover the grain-growing farmer in his ability to retain it. He need not\r\nlose over 16 per cent a year of nitrogen, and not one per cent _of the\r\nother elements of plant-food_.\r\n\r\nThe land lying on the borders of the creek could be greatly benefited by\r\ncutting surface ditches to let off the water; and later, probably it\r\nwill be found that a few underdrains can be put in to advantage. These\r\nalluvial soils on the borders of creeks and rivers are grand sources of\r\nnitrogen and other plant-food. I do not know the fact, but it is quite\r\nprobable that the meadows which Harris Lewis mows twice a year, are on\r\nthe banks of the river, and are perhaps flooded in the spring. But, be\r\nthis as it may, there is a field on the farm I am alluding to, lying on\r\nthe creek, which now produces a bountiful growth of weeds, rushes, and\r\ncoarse grasses, which I am sure could easily be made to produce great\r\ncrops of hay. The creek overflows in the spring, and the water lies on\r\nsome of the lower parts of the field until it is evaporated. A few\r\nditches would allow all the water to pass off, and this alone would be a\r\ngreat improvement. If the field was flooded in May or June, and\r\nthoroughly cultivated and harrowed, the sod would be sufficiently rotted\r\nto plow again in August. Then a thorough harrowing, rolling, and\r\ncultivating, would make it as mellow as a garden, and it could be seeded\r\ndown with timothy and other good grasses the last of August, or\r\nbeginning of September, and produce a good crop of hay the next year.\r\nOr, if thought better, it might be sown to rye and seeded down with it.\r\nIn either case the land would be greatly improved, and would be a\r\nproductive meadow or pasture for years to come--or until our young\r\ndairyman could afford to give it one of Harris Lewis’ “homœopathic”\r\ndoses of 40 loads of good manure per acre. He would then be able to cut\r\ntwo crops of hay a year--and such hay! But we are anticipating.\r\n\r\nThat stream which runs through the farm in the spring, and then dries\r\nup, could be made to irrigate several acres of the land adjoining. This\r\nwould double, or treble, or quadruple, (“hold on,” said the Deacon,) the\r\ncrops of grass as far as the water reached. The Deacon does not seem to\r\ncredit this statement; but I have seen wonderful effects produced by\r\nsuch a plan.\r\n\r\nWhat I am endeavoring to show, is, that these and similar means will\r\ngive us larger crops of hay and grass, and these in turn will enable us\r\nto keep more cows, and make more manure, and the manure will enable us\r\nto grow larger crops on other portions of the farm.\r\n\r\nI am aware that many will object to plowing up old grass land, and I do\r\nnot wish to be misunderstood on this point. If a farmer has a meadow\r\nthat will produce two or three tons of hay, or support a cow, to the\r\nacre, it would be folly to break it up. It is already doing all, or\r\nnearly all, that can be asked or desired. But suppose you have a piece\r\nof naturally good land that does not produce a ton of hay per acre, or\r\npasture a cow on three acres, if such land can be plowed without great\r\ndifficulty, I would break it up as early in the fall as possible, and\r\nsummer-fallow it thoroughly, and seed it down again, heavily, with grass\r\nseeds the next August. If the land does not need draining, it will not\r\nforget this treatment for many years, and it will be the farmer’s own\r\nfault if it ever runs down again.\r\n\r\nIn this country, where wages are so high, we must raise large crops per\r\nacre, or not raise any. Where land is cheap, it may sometimes pay to\r\ncompel a cow to travel over three or four acres to get her food, but we\r\ncannot afford to raise our hay in half ton crops; it costs too much to\r\nharvest them. High wages, high taxes, and high-priced land, necessitate\r\nhigh farming; and by high farming, I mean growing large crops every\r\nyear, and on every portion of the farm; but high wages and _low-priced\r\nland_ do not necessarily demand high farming. If the land is cheap we\r\ncan suffer it to lie idle without much loss. But when we _raise_ crops,\r\nwhether on high-priced land or on low-priced land, we must raise good\r\ncrops, or the expense of cultivating and harvesting them will eat up all\r\nthe profits. In the dairy districts, I believe land, in proportion to\r\nits quality and nearness to market, commands a higher price than land in\r\nthe grain-growing districts. Hence it follows that high farming should\r\nbe the aim of the American dairyman.\r\n\r\nI am told that there are farms in the dairy districts of this State\r\nworth from one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars per acre, on\r\nwhich a cow to four acres for the year is considered a good average. At\r\na meeting of the Little Falls Farmers’ Club, the Hon. Josiah Shull, gave\r\na statement of the receipts and expenses of his farm of 81½ acres. The\r\nfarm cost $130 per acre. He kept twenty cows, and fatted one for beef.\r\nThe receipts were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Twenty cows yielding 8,337 lbs. of cheese,\r\n    at about 14¼ cents per pound                        $1,186.33\r\n  Increase on beef cow                                      40.00\r\n  Calves                                                    45.00\r\n                                                        ---------\r\n  Total receipts                                        $1,271.33\r\n                      Expenses.\r\n  Boy, six months and board                               $180.00\r\n  Man by the year, and board                               360.00\r\n  Carting milk and manufacturing cheese                    215.00\r\n                                                          -------\r\n  Total cost of labor                                     $755.00\r\n                      The Other Expenses Were:\r\n  Fertilizers, plants, etc.                               $ 18.00\r\n  Horse-shoeing and other repairs of farming\r\n    implements, (which is certainly pretty cheap,)          50.00\r\n  Wear and tear of implements                               65.00\r\n  Average repairs of place and buildings                   175.00\r\n  Average depreciation and interest on stock               180.00\r\n  Insurance                                                  4.00\r\n  Incidentals, (also pretty low,)                           50.00\r\n                                                          -------\r\n                                                          $620.00\r\n             Total receipts                   $1,271.33.\r\n             Total expenses                    1,375.00.\r\n\r\nThis statement, it is said, the Club considered a very fair estimate.\r\n\r\nNow, here is a farm costing $10,595, the receipts from which, saying\r\nnothing about interest, are less than the expenses. And if you add two\r\ncents per pound more to the price of the cheese, the profit would still\r\nbe only about $50 per year. The trouble is not so much in the low price\r\nof cheese, _as in the low product per acre_. I know some grain-growing\r\nfarmers who have done no better than this for a few years past.\r\n\r\nMr. Shull places the annual depreciation and interest on stock at $180,\r\nequal to nearly one-seventh of the total receipts of the farm. It would\r\npay the wages and board of another man for six months. Can not it be\r\navoided? Good beef is relatively much higher in this State than good\r\ncheese. Some of the dairy authorities tell us that cheese is the\r\ncheapest animal food in the world, while beef is the dearest. Why, then,\r\nshould our dairymen confine their attention to the production of the\r\ncheapest of farm products, and neglect almost entirely the production of\r\nthe dearest? If beef is high and cheese low, why not raise more beef? On\r\nlow-priced land it may be profitable to raise and keep cows solely for\r\nthe production of cheese, and when the cows are no longer profitable for\r\nthis purpose, to sacrifice them--to throw them aside as we do a worn-out\r\nmachine. And in similar circumstances we may be able to keep sheep\r\nsolely for their wool, but on high-priced land we can not afford to keep\r\nsheep merely for their wool. We must adopt a higher system of farming\r\nand feeding, and keep sheep that will give us wool, lambs, and mutton.\r\nIn parts of South America, where land costs nothing, cattle can be kept\r\nfor their bones, tallow, and hides, but where food is costly we must\r\nmake better use of it. A cow is a machine for converting vegetable food\r\ninto veal, butter, cheese, and beef. The first cost of the machine, if a\r\ngood one, is considerable--say $100. This machine has to be kept running\r\nnight and day, summer and winter, week days and Sundays. If we were\r\nrunning a steam-flouring mill that could never be allowed to stop, we\r\nshould be careful to lay in a good supply of coal and also have plenty\r\nof grain on hand to grind, so that the mill would never have to run\r\nempty. No sensible man would keep up steam merely to run the mill. He\r\nwould want to grind all the time, and as much as possible; and yet coal\r\nis a much cheaper source of power than the hay and corn with which we\r\nrun our milk-producing machine. How often is the latter allowed to run\r\nempty? The machine is running night and day--must run, but is it always\r\nrunning to advantage? Do we furnish fuel enough to enable it to do full\r\nwork, or only little more than enough to run the machinery?\r\n\r\n“What has all this to do with making manure on dairy farms?” asked the\r\nDeacon; “you are wandering from the point.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not; I am trying to show that good feeding will pay better than\r\npoor feeding--and better food means better manure.”\r\n\r\nI estimate that it takes from 15 to 18 lbs. of ordinary hay per day to\r\nrun this cow-machine, which we have been talking about, even when kept\r\nwarm and comfortable; and if exposed to cold storms, probably not less\r\nthan 20 lbs. of hay a day, or its equivalent, and this merely to keep\r\nthe machine running, without doing any work. It requires this to keep\r\nthe cow alive, and to prevent her losing flesh. If not supplied with the\r\nrequisite amount of food for this purpose, she will take enough fat and\r\nflesh from her own body to make up the deficiency; and if she cannot get\r\nit, the machine will stop--in other words, the cow will die.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, a machine that costs say $100; that will last on an\r\naverage eight years; that requires careful management; that must have\r\nconstant watching, or it will be liable to get out of order, and that\r\nrequires, merely to keep it running, say 20 lbs. of hay per day. Now,\r\nwhat do we get in return? If we furnish only 20 lbs. of hay per day we\r\nget--_nothing_ except manure. If we furnish 25 lbs. of hay per day, or\r\nits equivalent, we get, say half a pound of cheese per day. If we\r\nfurnish 30 lbs. we get one pound of cheese per day, or 365 lbs. a year.\r\nWe may not get the one pound of cheese every day in the year; sometimes\r\nthe cow, instead of giving milk, is furnishing food for her embryo calf,\r\nor storing up fat and flesh; and this fat and flesh will be used by and\r\nby to produce milk. But it all comes from the food eaten by the cow; and\r\nis equal to one pound of cheese per day for 30 lbs. of hay or its\r\nequivalent consumed; 20 lbs. of hay gives us nothing; 25 lbs. of hay\r\ngives us half a pound of cheese, or 40 lbs. of cheese from one ton of\r\nhay; 30 lbs. gives us one pound, or 66⅔ lbs. of cheese from one ton of\r\nhay; 35 lbs. gives us 1½ lbs., or 85 5/7 lbs. of cheese to one ton of\r\nhay; 40 lbs. gives us 2 lbs. of cheese, or 100 lbs. of cheese from one\r\nton of hay; 45 lbs. gives us 2⅓ lbs. of cheese, or 111 lbs. of cheese\r\nfrom one ton of hay; 50 lbs. gives us 3 lbs. of cheese, or 120 lbs. of\r\ncheese from one ton of hay.\r\n\r\nOn this basis, one ton of hay, _in excess of the amount required to keep\r\nup the animal heat and sustain the vital functions_, gives us 200 lbs.\r\nof cheese. The point I wish to illustrate by these figures, which are of\r\ncourse hypothetical, is, that it is exceedingly desirable to get animals\r\nthat will eat, digest, and assimilate a large amount of food, over and\r\nabove that required to keep up the heat of the body and sustain the\r\nvital functions. When a cow eats only 25 lbs. of hay a day, it requires\r\none ton of hay to produce 40 lbs. of cheese. But if we could induce her\r\nto eat, digest, and assimilate 50 lbs. a day, one ton would produce 120\r\nlbs. of cheese. If a cow eats 33 lbs. of hay per day, or its equivalent\r\nin grass, it will require four acres of land, with a productive capacity\r\nequal to 1½ tons of hay per acre, to keep her a year. Such a cow,\r\naccording to the figures given above, will produce 401½ lbs. of cheese a\r\nyear, or its equivalent in growth. A farm of 80 acres, on this basis,\r\nwould support 20 cows, yielding, say 8,000 lbs. of cheese. Increase the\r\nproductive power of the farm one half, (I hope the Deacon has not gone\r\nto sleep), and keep 20 cows that will eat half as much again food, and\r\nwe should then get 21,600 lbs. of cheese. If cheese is worth 15 cents\r\nper lb., a farm of 80 acres, producing 1½ tons of hay, or its\r\nequivalent, per acre, and supporting 20 cows, would give us a gross\r\nreturn of $1,204.50. The same farm so improved as to produce 2¼ tons of\r\nhay or its equivalent, per acre--fed to 20 cows _capable of eating,\r\ndigesting, and assimilating it_--would give a gross return of $3,240.\r\n\r\nIn presenting these figures, I hope you will not think me a visionary.\r\nI do not think it is possible to get a cow to produce 3 lbs. of cheese a\r\nday throughout the whole year. But I do think it quite possible to so\r\nbreed and feed a cow that she will produce 3 lbs. of cheese per day, _or\r\nits equivalent_ in veal, flesh, or fat. We frequently have cows that\r\nproduce 3 lbs. of cheese a day for several weeks; and a cow _can_ be so\r\nfed that she will produce 3 lbs. of cheese a day without losing weight.\r\nAnd if she can extract this amount of matter out of the food for a part\r\nof the year, why can not she do so for the whole year? Are the powers of\r\ndigestion weaker in the fall and winter than in spring and summer? If\r\nnot, we unquestionably sustain great loss by allowing this digestive\r\npower to run to waste. This digestive power costs us 20 lbs. of hay a\r\nday. We can ill afford to let it lie dormant. But the Deacon will tell\r\nme that the cows are allowed all the food they will eat, winter and\r\nsummer. Then we must, if they have digestive power to spare, endeavor to\r\npersuade them to eat more. If they eat as much hay or grass as their\r\nstomachs are capable of holding, we must endeavor to give them richer\r\nhay or grass. Not one farmer in a thousand seems to appreciate the\r\nadvantage of having hay or grass containing a high percentage of\r\nnutriment. I have endeavored to show that a cow eating six tons of hay,\r\nor its equivalent, in a year, would produce 400 lbs. of cheese, worth\r\n$60. While a cow capable of eating, digesting, and turning to good\r\naccount, nine tons of hay, or its equivalent, would produce 1,090 lbs.\r\nof cheese, or its equivalent in other products, worth $162.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to interrupt the gentleman,” said the Deacon with mock\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n“Then pray don’t,” said I; “I will not detain you long, and the subject\r\nis one which ought to interest you and every other farmer who keeps his\r\ncows on poor grass in summer, and corn-stalks and straw in winter.”\r\n\r\nI was going to say, when the Deacon interrupted me, that the stomach of\r\na cow may not allow her to eat nine tons of hay a year, but it will\r\nallow her to eat six tons; and if these six tons contain as much\r\nnutriment as the nine tons, what is the real difference in its value?\r\nOrdinarily we should probably estimate the one at $10 per ton, and the\r\nother at $15. But according to the above figures, one is worth $10 per\r\nton and the other $27. To get rich grass, therefore, should be the aim\r\nof the American dairyman. I hope the Deacon begins to see what\r\nconnection this has with a large pile of rich manure.\r\n\r\nI do not mean merely a heavy growth of grass, but grass containing a\r\nhigh percentage of nutriment. Our long winters and heavy snows are a\r\ngreat advantage to us in this respect. Our grass in the spring, after\r\nits long rest, ought to start up like asparagus, and, under the\r\norganizing influence of our clear skies, and powerful sun, ought to be\r\nexceedingly nutritious. Comparatively few farmers, however, live up to\r\ntheir privileges in this respect. Our climate is better than our\r\nfarming, the sun richer than our neglected soil. England may be able to\r\nproduce more grass per acre in a year than we can, but we ought to\r\nproduce richer grass, and, consequently, more cheese to a cow. And I\r\nbelieve, in fact, that such is often the case. The English dairyman has\r\nthe advantage of a longer season of growth. We have a shorter season but\r\na brighter sun, and if we do not have richer grass it is due to the want\r\nof draining, clean culture, and manuring. The object of American\r\ndairymen should be, not only to obtain more grass per acre, but to\r\nincrease its nutriment in a given bulk. If we could increase it\r\none-half, making six tons equal to nine tons, we have shown that it is\r\nnearly three times as valuable. Whether this can be done, I have not now\r\ntime to consider; but at any rate if your land produces as many weeds as\r\ndo some fields on my farm, not to say the Deacon’s, and if the\r\nplant-food that these weeds absorb, could be organized by nutritious\r\ngrasses, this alone would do a good deal towards accomplishing the\r\nobject. Whether this can be done or not, we want cows that can eat and\r\nturn to good account as much food per annum as is contained in nine tons\r\nof ordinary meadow-hay; and we want this nutriment in a bulk not\r\nexceeding six tons of hay. _If possible_, we should get this amount of\r\nnutriment in grass or hay. But if we can not do this, we must _feed\r\nenough concentrated food_ to bring it up to the desired standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n“But will it pay?” asked the Deacon; “I have not much faith in buying\r\nfeed. A farmer ought to raise everything he feeds out.”\r\n\r\n“As a rule, this may be true,” I replied, “but there are many\r\nexceptions. I am trying to show that it will often pay a dairyman well\r\nto buy feed rich in nitrogen and phosphates, so as to make rich manure,\r\nand give him a start. After he gets his land rich, there is little\r\ndifficulty in keeping up its productiveness.\r\n\r\n“Now, I have said--and the figures, if anything, are too low--that if a\r\ncow, eating six tons of hay, or its equivalent, a year, produces 400\r\nlbs. of cheese, a cow capable of eating, digesting, and turning to good\r\naccount nine tons of hay, or its equivalent, a year, would produce 1,090\r\nlbs. of cheese, or its equivalent in other products.”\r\n\r\nI would like to say much more on this subject, but I hope enough has\r\nbeen said to show that there is great advantage in feeding rich food,\r\neven so far as the production of milk or beef is concerned; and if this\r\nis the case, then there is no difficulty in making rich manure on a\r\ndairy farm.\r\n\r\nAnd I am delighted to know that many farmers in the dairy districts are\r\npurchasing more and more bran and meal every year. Taking milk, and\r\nbeef, and manure all into the account, I feel sure that it will be found\r\nhighly profitable; but you must have good cows--cows that can turn their\r\nextra food to good account.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to discuss the merits of the different breeds of\r\ncows. All I wish to show is, that to make better manure, we must use\r\nricher food; and to feed this to advantage, we must have animals that\r\ncan turn a large amount of food, over and above the amount required to\r\nsustain the vital functions, into milk, flesh, etc.\r\n\r\n“You do not think,” said the Deacon, “that a well-bred cow makes any\r\nricher manure than a common cow?”\r\n\r\nOf course not; but to make rich manure, we must feed well; and we can\r\nnot afford to feed well unless we have good animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO SAVE AND APPLY MANURE ON A DAIRY-FARM.\r\n\r\nWe can not go into details on this subject. The truth is, there are\r\nseveral good methods of saving manure, and which is best depends\r\nentirely on circumstances. The real point is to save the urine, and keep\r\nthe cow-stable clean and sweet. There are three prominent methods\r\nadopted:\r\n\r\n1st. To throw all the liquid and solid excrements into a manure-cellar\r\nunderneath the cow-stable. In this cellar, dry swamp-muck, dry earth, or\r\nother absorbent material, is mixed with the manure in sufficient\r\nquantity to keep down offensive odors. A little dry earth or muck is\r\nalso used in the stable, scattering it twice a day in the gutters and\r\nunder the hind legs of the cows. Where this is carried out, it has many\r\nand decided advantages.\r\n\r\n2d. To wheel or throw out the solid parts of the manure, and to have a\r\ndrain for carrying the liquid into a tank, where it can be pumped on to\r\nthe heap of manure in the yard. Where many horses or sheep are kept, and\r\nonly a few cows, this plan can often be used to advantage, as the heap\r\nof manure in the yard, consisting of horse-manure, sheep-manure, and a\r\nsmall portion of cow-dung, will be able to absorb all the urine of the\r\ncows.\r\n\r\n3d. To use sufficient bedding to absorb all the urine in the stable. In\r\nmy own case, as I have said before, we usually chaff all our straw and\r\nstalks. The orts are used for bedding, and we also use a little dry\r\nearth--or, to be more exact, I use it when I attend to the matter\r\nmyself, but have always found more or less trouble in getting the work\r\ndone properly, unless I give it personal attention. To use “dirt” to\r\nkeep the stable clean, is not a popular plan in this neighborhood. Where\r\nthere is an abundance of straw, and especially if cut into chaff, the\r\neasiest way to keep the stable clean, and the cows comfortable, is to\r\nuse enough of this chaffed straw to absorb all the liquid. Clean out the\r\nstable twice a day, and wheel the manure directly to the heap, and\r\nspread it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to the application of manure on a dairy-farm, we have seen\r\nwhat Harris Lewis does with his. I also wrote to T. L. Harison, Esq.,\r\nof St. Lawrence Co., N.Y.; and knowing that he is not only a very\r\nintelligent farmer and breeder, but also one of our best agricultural\r\nwriters, I asked him if he had written anything on the subject of\r\nmanures.\r\n\r\n“St. Lawrence Co.,” said the Deacon, “produces capital grass, oats, and\r\nbarley, but is, I should think, too far north for winter wheat; but what\r\ndid Mr Harison say?”--Here is his letter:\r\n\r\n“I never wrote anything about manure. Catch me at it! Nor do I know\r\nanything about the management of barn-yard manure worth telling. My own\r\npractice is dictated quite as much by convenience as by considerations\r\nof economy.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the Deacon; “he writes like a sensible man.”\r\n\r\n“My rotation,” he continues, “is such that the bulk of the manure made\r\nis applied to _one crop_; that is, to my hoed crops, corn, potatoes, and\r\nroots, in the second year.\r\n\r\n“The manure from the stables is thrown or wheeled out under the sheds\r\nadjoining, and as fast as it becomes so large a quantity as to be in the\r\nway, or whenever there is an opportunity, it is hauled out to the field,\r\nwhere it is to be used, and put in large piles. It is turned once, if\r\npossible, in the spring, and then spread.\r\n\r\n“The quantity applied, is, as near as may be, 25 loads per acre; but as\r\nwe use a great deal of straw, we haul out 30 loads, and estimate that in\r\nthe spring it will be about 25 loads.\r\n\r\n“If we have any more (and occasionally we have 100 loads over), we pile\r\nit near the barn, and turn it once or twice during the summer, and use\r\nit as seems most profitable--sometimes to top-dress an old grass-field,\r\nthat for some reason we prefer not to break for another year. Sometimes\r\nit goes on a piece of fall wheat, and sometimes is kept over for a\r\nbarley field the following spring, and harrowed in just before sowing.\r\n\r\n“I should spread the manure as it comes from the sheds, instead of\r\npiling it, but the great quantity of snow we usually have, has always\r\nseemed to be an insuperable obstacle. It is an advantage to pile it, and\r\nto give it one turning, but, on the other hand, the piles made in cold\r\nweather freeze through, and they take a provokingly long time to thaw\r\nout in the spring. I never found manure _piled_ out of doors to get too\r\nmuch water from rain.\r\n\r\n“I have given up using gypsum, except a little in the stables, because\r\nthe clover grows too strong without it, and so long as this is the case,\r\nI do not need gypsum. But I sometimes have a piece of oats or barley\r\nthat stands still, and looks sick, and a dose of gypsum helps it very\r\nmuch.”\r\n\r\n“That is a fact worth remembering,” said the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“I use some superphosphate,” continues Mr. Harison, “and some ground\r\nbones on my turnips. We also use superphosphate on oats, barley, and\r\nwheat (about 200 lbs. per acre), and find it pays. Last year, our\r\nestimate was, on 10 acres of oats, comparing with a strip in the middle,\r\nleft for the purpose, that the 200 lbs. of superphosphate increased the\r\ncrop 15 bushels per acre, and gave a gain in quality. It was the\r\n“Manhattan,” which has about three per cent ammonia, and seven to eight\r\nper cent soluble phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n“My rotation, which I stick to as close as I can, is: 1, oats; 2, corn,\r\nand potatoes, and roots; 3, barley or spring wheat; 4, 5, and 6, grass\r\n(clover or timothy, with a little mixture occasionally).\r\n\r\n“I am trying to get to 4, fall wheat, but it is mighty risky.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“That is a very sensible letter,” said the Deacon; “but it is evident\r\nthat he raises more grain than I supposed was generally the case in the\r\ndairy districts; and the fact that his clover is so heavy that he does\r\nnot need plaster, indicates that his land is rich.”\r\n\r\nIt merely confirms what I have said all along, and that is, that the\r\ndairymen, if they will feed their animals liberally, and cultivate their\r\nsoil thoroughly, can soon have productive farms. There are very few of\r\nus in this section who can make manure enough to give all our corn,\r\npotatoes, and roots, 25 loads of rotted manure per acre, and have some\r\nto spare.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1877, Mr. Harison wrote: “I have been hauling out\r\nmanure all winter as fast as made, and putting it on the land. At first\r\nwe spread it; but when deep snows came, we put it in small heaps. The\r\nfield looks as if there had been a grain crop on it left uncut.”\r\n\r\n“That last remark,” said the Doctor, “indicates that the manure looks\r\nmore like straw than well-rotted dung, and is an argument in favor of\r\nyour plan of piling the manure in the yard or field, instead of\r\nspreading it on the land, or putting it in small heaps.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF MANURES ON GRAIN-FARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am surprised to find,” said the Deacon, “that Mr. Harison, living as\r\nhe does in the great grass and dairy district of this State, should\r\nraise so much grain. He has nearly as large a proportion of his land\r\nunder the plow as some of the best wheat-growers of Western New York.”\r\n\r\nThis remark of the Deacon is right to the point. The truth is, that some\r\nof our best wheat-growers are plowing less land, and are raising more\r\ngrass, and keeping more stock; and some of the dairymen, though not\r\nkeeping less stock, are plowing more land. The better farmers of both\r\nsections are approaching each other.\r\n\r\nAt all events, it is certain that the wheat growers will keep more\r\nstock. I wrote to the Hon. Geo. Geddes, of Onondaga Co., N.Y., well\r\nknown as a large wheat-grower, and as a life-long advocate of keeping up\r\nthe fertility of our farms by growing clover. He replies as follows:\r\n\r\n“I regret that I have not time to give your letter the consideration it\r\ndeserves. The subject you have undertaken is truly a difficult one. The\r\ncircumstances of a grain-raiser and a dairyman are so unlike, that their\r\nviews in regard to the treatment of the manure produced on the farm\r\nwould vary as greatly as the lines of farming they follow.\r\n\r\n“The grain-grower has straw in excess; he tries hard to get it into such\r\nform that he can draw it to his fields, and get it at work, at the least\r\ncost in labor. So he covers his barn-yards deep with straw, after each\r\nsnow-storm, and gets his cattle, sheep, and horses, to trample it under\r\nfoot; and he makes his pigs convert all he can into such form that it\r\nwill do to apply it to his pastures, etc., in winter or early spring.\r\n\r\n“A load of such manure is large, perhaps, but of no very great value, as\r\ncompared with well-rotted stable-manure from grain-fed horses; but it is\r\nas good as much that I have seen drawn from city stables, and carried\r\nfar, to restore the worn-out hay-fields on the shores of the North\r\nRiver--in fact, quite like it.\r\n\r\n“The dairyman, generally, has but little straw, and his manure is mostly\r\ndung of cows, worth much more, per cord, than the straw-litter of the\r\ngrain-growers.\r\n\r\n“The grain-grower will want no sheds for keeping off the rain, but,\r\nrather, he will desire more water than will fall on an open yard. The\r\nmilkman will wish to protect his cow-dung from all rains, or even snows;\r\nso he is a great advocate of manure-sheds. These two classes of farmers\r\nwill adopt quite unlike methods of applying their manure to crops.\r\n\r\n“I have cited these two classes of farmers, simply to show the\r\ndifficulty of making any universal laws in regard to the treatment and\r\nuse of barn-yard manure. * * *\r\n\r\n“I think you and I are fully agreed in regard to the farm being the true\r\nsource of the manure that is to make the land grow better with use, and\r\nstill produce crops--perhaps you will go with me so far as to say, the\r\ngreater the crops, the more manure they will make--and the more manure,\r\nthe larger the crops.\r\n\r\n“Now, I object to any special farming, when applied to a whole great\r\ndivision of country, such as merely raising grain, or devoted entirely\r\nto dairying.\r\n\r\n“I saw at Rome, N.Y., these two leading branches of New York farming\r\nunited on the Huntington tract of 1,300 acres. Three or four farms (I\r\nforget which) had separate and distinct management, conducted by\r\ndifferent families, but each had a dairy combined with the raising of\r\nlarge crops of grain, such as wheat, corn, oats, etc. These grain-crops,\r\nwith suitable areas of meadow and pasture, sustained the dairy, and the\r\ncows converted much of the grain, and all of the forage, into manure.\r\nThus was combined, to mutual advantage, these two important branches of\r\nNew York farming. Wheat and cheese to sell, and constant improvement in\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n“In our own case, sheep have been combined with grain-raising. So we\r\nhave sold wool, wheat, and barley, and, in all my life, not five tons of\r\nhay. Clover, you know, has been our great forage-crop. We have wintered\r\nour sheep mostly on clover-hay, having some timothy mixed with it, that\r\nwas necessarily cut (to make into hay with the medium, or early clover,)\r\nwhen it was but grass. We have fed such hay to our cows and horses, and\r\nhave usually worked into manure the corn-stalks of about 20 acres of\r\ngood corn, each winter, and we have worked all the straw into shape to\r\napply as manure that we could, spreading it thickly on pastures and such\r\nother fields as were convenient. Some straw we have sold, mostly to\r\npaper-makers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“That,” said the Deacon, “is good, old-fashioned farming. Plenty of\r\nstraw for bedding, and good clover and timothy-hay for feed, with wool,\r\nwheat, and barley to sell. No talk about oil-cake, malt-combs, and\r\nmangels; nothing about superphosphate, guano, or swamp-muck.”\r\n\r\nMr. Geddes and Mr. Johnston are both representative farmers; both are\r\nlarge wheat-growers; both keep their land clean and thoroughly\r\ncultivated; both use gypsum freely; both raise large crops of clover and\r\ntimothy; both keep sheep, and yet they represent two entirely different\r\nsystems of farming. One is the great advocate of clover; the other is\r\nthe great advocate of manure.\r\n\r\nI once wrote to Mr. Geddes, asking his opinion as to the best time to\r\nplow under clover for wheat. He replied as follows:\r\n\r\n“Plow under the clover when it is at full growth. But your question can\r\nmuch better be answered at the end of a long, free talk, which can best\r\nbe had here. I have many times asked you to come here, not to see fine\r\nfarming, for we have none to show, but to see land that has been used to\r\ntest the effects of clover for nearly 70 years. On the ground, I could\r\ntalk to a willing auditor long, if not wisely. I am getting tired of\r\nbeing misunderstood, and of having my statements doubted when I talk\r\nabout clover as the great renovator of land. You preach agricultural\r\ntruth, and the facts you would gather in this neighborhood are worth\r\nyour knowing, and worth giving to the world. So come here and gather\r\nsome facts about clover. All that I shall try to prove to you is, that\r\nthe fact that clover and plaster are by far the cheapest manures that\r\ncan be had for our lands, has been demonstrated by many farmers beyond a\r\ndoubt--so much cheaper than barn-yard manure that the mere loading of\r\nand spreading costs more than the plaster and clover. Do not quote me as\r\nsaying this, but come and see the farms hereabouts, and talk with our\r\nfarmers.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course I went, and had a capital time. Mr. Geddes has a magnificent\r\nfarm of about 400 acres, some four miles from Syracuse. It is in high\r\ncondition, and is continually improving, and this is due to growing\r\nlarge and frequent crops of clover, and _to good, deep plowing, and\r\nclean and thorough culture_.\r\n\r\nWe drove round among the farmers. “Here is a man,” said Mr. G., “who run\r\nin debt $45 per acre for his farm. He has educated his family, paid off\r\nhis debt, and reports his net profits at from $2,000 to $2,500 a year on\r\na farm of 90 acres; and this is due to clover. You see he is building a\r\nnew barn, and that does not look as though his land was running down\r\nunder the system.” The next farmer we came to was also putting up a new\r\nbarn, and another farmer was enlarging an old one. “Now, these farmers\r\nhave never paid a dollar for manure of any kind except plaster, and\r\ntheir lands certainly do not deteriorate.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Syracuse, I went to Geneva, to see our old friend John Johnston.\r\n“Why did you not tell me you were coming?” he said. “I would have met\r\nyou at the cars. But I am right glad to see you. I want to show you my\r\nwheat, where I put on 250 lbs. of guano per acre last fall. People here\r\ndon’t know that I used it, and you must not mention it. It is grand.”\r\n\r\nI do not know that I ever saw a finer piece of wheat. It was the Diehl\r\nvariety, sown 14th September, at the rate of 1¼ bushels per acre. It was\r\nquite thick enough. One breadth of the drill was sown at the rate of two\r\nbushels per acre. This is earlier. “But,” said Mr. J., “the other will\r\nhave larger heads, and will yield more.” After examining the wheat, we\r\nwent to look at the piles of muck and manure in the barn-yard, and from\r\nthese to a splendid crop of timothy. “It will go 2½ tons of hay per\r\nacre,” said Mr. J., “and now look at this adjoining field. It is just as\r\ngood land naturally, and there is merely a fence between, and yet the\r\ngrass and clover are so poor as hardly to be worth cutting.”\r\n\r\n“What makes the difference?” I asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnston, emphatically, “Manure.”\r\n\r\nThe poor field did not belong to him!\r\n\r\nMr. Johnston’s farm was originally a cold, wet, clayey soil. Mr. Geddes’\r\nland did not need draining, or very little. Of course, land that needs\r\ndraining, is richer after it is drained, than land that is naturally\r\ndrained. And though Mr. Johnston was always a good farmer, yet he says\r\nhe “never made money until he commenced to drain.” The accumulated\r\nfertility in the land could then be made available by good tillage, and\r\nfrom that day to this, his land has been growing richer and richer. And,\r\nin fact, the same is true of Mr. Geddes’ farm. It is richer land to-day\r\nthan when first plowed, while there is one field that for seventy years\r\nhas had no manure applied to it, except plaster. How is this to be\r\nexplained? Mr. Geddes would say it was due to clover and plaster. But\r\nthis does not fully satisfy those who claim, (and truly), that “always\r\ntaking out of the meal-tub and never putting in, soon comes to the\r\nbottom.” The clover can add nothing to the land, that it did not get\r\nfrom the soil, except organic matter obtained from the atmosphere, and\r\nthe plaster furnishes little or nothing except lime and sulphuric acid.\r\nThere are all the other ingredients of plant-food to be accounted\r\nfor--phosphoric acid, potash, soda, magnesia, etc. A crop of clover, or\r\ncorn, or wheat, or barley, or oats, will not come to perfection unless\r\nevery one of these elements is present in the soil in an available\r\ncondition. Mr. Geddes has not furnished a single ounce of any one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Where do they come from?”\r\n\r\nI answer, _from the soil itself_. There is probably enough of these\r\nelements in the soil to last ten thousand years; and if we return to the\r\nsoil all the straw, chaff, and bran, and sell nothing but fine flour,\r\nmeat, butter, etc., there is probably enough to last a million years,\r\nand you and I need not trouble ourselves with speculations as to what\r\nwill happen after that time. Nearly all our soils are practically\r\ninexhaustible. But of course these elements are not in an available\r\ncondition. If they were, the rains would wash them all into the ocean.\r\nThey are rendered available by a kind of fermentation. A manure-heap\r\npacked as hard and solid as a rock would not decay; but break it up,\r\nmake it fine, turn it occasionally so as to expose it to the atmosphere,\r\nand with the proper degree of moisture and heat it will ferment rapidly,\r\nand all its elements will soon become available food for plants. Nothing\r\nhas been created by the process. It was all there. We have simply made\r\nit _available_. So it is with the soil. Break it up, make it fine, turn\r\nit occasionally, expose it to the atmosphere, and the elements it\r\ncontains become available.\r\n\r\nI do not think that Mr. Geddes’ land is any better, naturally, than\r\nyours or mine. We can all raise fair crops by cultivating the land\r\nthoroughly, and by never allowing a weed to grow. On Mr. Lawes’\r\nexperimental wheat-field, the plot that has never received a particle of\r\nmanure, produces _every year_ an average of about 15 bushels per acre.\r\nAnd the whole crop is removed--grain, straw, and chaff. Nothing is\r\nreturned. And that the land is not remarkably rich, is evident from the\r\nfact that some of the farms in the neighborhood, produce, under the\r\nordinary system of management, but little more wheat, once in four or\r\nfive years than is raised _every year_ on this experimental plot without\r\nany manure.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because these farmers do not half work their land, and the manure\r\nthey make is little better than rotten straw. Mr. Lawes’ wheat-field is\r\nplowed twice every year, and when I was there, the crop was hand-hoed\r\ntwo or three times in the spring. Not a weed is suffered to grow. And\r\nthis is all there is to it.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, instead of raising 15 bushels of wheat every year, it is\r\na good deal better to raise a crop of 30 bushels every other year, and\r\nstill better to raise 45 bushels every third year. And it is here that\r\nclover comes to our aid. It will enable us to do this very thing, and\r\nthe land runs no greater risk of exhaustion than Mr. Lawes’ unmanured\r\nwheat crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Geddes and I do not differ as much as you suppose. In fact, I do not\r\nbelieve that we differ at all. He has for years been an earnest advocate\r\nfor growing clover as a renovating crop. He thinks it by far the\r\ncheapest manure that can be obtained in this section. I agree with him\r\nmost fully in all these particulars. He formed his opinion from\r\nexperience and observation. I derived mine from the Rothamsted\r\nexperiments. And the more I see of practical farming, the more am I\r\nsatisfied of their truth. Clover is, unquestionably, the great\r\nrenovating crop of American agriculture. A crop of clover, equal to two\r\ntons of hay, when plowed under, will furnish more ammonia to the soil\r\nthan twenty tons of straw-made manure, drawn out fresh and wet in the\r\nspring, or than twelve tons of our ordinary barn-yard manure. No wonder\r\nMr. Geddes and other intelligent farmers recommend plowing under clover\r\nas manure. I differ from them in no respect except this: that it is not\r\nabsolutely essential to plow clover under in the green state in order to\r\nget its fertilizing effect; but, if made into hay, and this hay is fed\r\nto animals, and all the manure carefully saved, and returned to the\r\nland, there need be comparatively little loss. The animals will seldom\r\ntake out more than from five to ten per cent of all the nitrogen\r\nfurnished in the food--and less still of mineral matter. I advocate\r\ngrowing all the clover you possibly can--so does Mr. Geddes. He says,\r\nplow it under for manure. So say I--unless you can make more from\r\nfeeding out the clover-hay, than will pay you for waiting a year, and\r\nfor cutting and curing the clover and drawing back the manure. If you\r\nplow it under, you are sure of it. There is no loss. In feeding it out,\r\nyou may lose more or less from leaching, and injurious fermentation.\r\nBut, of course, you need not lose anything, except the little that is\r\nretained in the flesh, or wool, or milk, of the animals. As things _are_\r\non many farms, it is perhaps best to plow under the clover for manure at\r\nonce. As things ought to be, it is a most wasteful practice. If you know\r\nhow to feed out the hay to advantage, and take pains to save the manure\r\n(and to add to its value by feeding oil-cake, bran, etc., with it), it\r\nis far better to mow your clover, once for hay, and once for seed, than\r\nto plow it under. Buy oil-cake and bran with the money got from the\r\nseed, and growing clover-seed will not injure the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that Mr. Geddes occasionally sells straw. I once sold\r\n15 tons of straw to the paper-makers for $150, they drawing it\r\nthemselves, and some of my neighbors criticised me severely for doing\r\nso. It is not considered an orthodox practice. I do not advocate selling\r\nstraw as a rule; but, if you have more than you can use to advantage,\r\nand it is bringing a good price, sell part of the straw and buy bran,\r\noil-cake, etc., with the money. To feed nothing but straw to stock is\r\npoor economy; and to rot it down for manure is no better. Straw itself\r\nis not worth $3.00 a ton for manure; and as one ton of straw, spread in\r\nan open yard to rot, will make, in spring, about four tons of so-called\r\nmanure, and if it costs 50 cents a ton to draw out and spread it, the\r\nstraw, even at this comparatively high estimate of its value, nets you,\r\nwhen fed out alone, or rotted down, only $1.00 a ton.\r\n\r\nI had about 30 tons of straw. Fed out alone or rotted down it would make\r\n120 tons of manure. After deducting the expense of hauling, and\r\nspreading, it nets me on the land, $30. Now sell half the straw for\r\n$150, and buy three tons of oil-cake to feed out with the other half,\r\nand you would have about seventy tons of manure. The manure from the\r\nfifteen tons of straw is worth, say $45, and from the three tons of\r\noil-cake, $60, or $105. It will cost $35 to draw and spread it, and will\r\nthus net on the land, $70. So far as the manure question is concerned,\r\ntherefore, it is far better to sell half your straw, and buy oil-cake\r\nwith the money, than to feed it out alone--and I think it is also far\r\nbetter for the stock. Of course, it would be better for the farm, not to\r\nsell any of the straw, and to buy six tons of oil-cake to feed out with\r\nit; but those of us who are short of capital, must be content to bring\r\nup our land by slow degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am at a loss to understand,” wrote Mr. Geddes, “what you mean, when\r\nyou say that a ton of straw will make, in the spring of the year, four\r\ntons of so-called manure. If you had said that four tons of straw would\r\nmake one ton of manure, I should have thought nothing of it. But how you\r\ncan turn one ton of straw into four tons of anything that anybody will\r\ncall manure, I do not see. In a conversation I had with Hon. Lewis F.\r\nAllen, of Black Rock, more than a year ago, he told me that he had\r\nenquired of the man who furnished hay for feeding cattle at the Central\r\nYards, in Buffalo, as to the loads of manure he sold, and though I can\r\nnot now say the exact quantity to a ton of hay, I remember that it was\r\nvery little--far less than I had before supposed. Please explain this\r\nstraw-manure matter.”\r\n\r\nBoussingault, the great French chemist-farmer, repeatedly analyzed the\r\nmanure from his barn-yard. “The animals which had produced this dung,\r\nwere 30 horses, 30 oxen, and from 10 to 20 pigs. The absolute quantity\r\nof moisture was ascertained, by first drying in the air a considerable\r\nweight of dung, and after pounding, continuing and completing, the\r\ndrying of a given quantity.” No one can doubt the accuracy of the\r\nresults. The dung made in the\r\n\r\n  Winter of 1837-8, contained 79.6 per cent of water.\r\n    ”     ” 1838-9,     ”     77.8  ”   ”    ”   ”\r\n  Autumn  ” 1839,       ”     80.4  ”   ”    ”   ”\r\n\r\nFresh solid cow-dung contains, according to the same authority, 90 per\r\ncent of water.\r\n\r\nI have frequently seen manure drawn out in the spring, that had not been\r\ndecomposed at all, and with more or less snow among it, and with water\r\ndripping from the wagon, while it was being loaded. It was, in fact,\r\nstraw saturated with water, and discolored by the droppings of animals.\r\nNow, how much of such manure would a ton of dry straw make? If we should\r\ntake 20 lbs. of straw, trample it down, and from time to time sprinkle\r\nit with water and snow, until we had got on 80 lbs., and then put on 20\r\nlbs. more straw, and 80 lbs. more water, and keep on until we had used\r\nup a ton of straw, how much “so-called manure,” should we have to draw\r\nout?\r\n\r\n  2,000 lbs. of straw, and 8,000 lbs. water\r\n      = 10,000 lbs. so-called manure.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we get five tons of such manure from one ton of straw.\r\nThis is, perhaps, an extreme case, but there can be little doubt, that a\r\nton of straw, trampled down by cattle, and sheep, in an open barn-yard,\r\nexposed to snow and rain, would weigh four tons when drawn out wet in\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, it is quite an argument in favor of manure cellars. I have always\r\nhad a prejudice against them--probably, because the first one I saw was\r\nbadly managed. There is, however, no necessity, even in an ordinary open\r\nbarn-yard, with more or less sheds and stables, of having so much water\r\nin the manure when drawn out. The real point of my remarks, which so\r\nsurprised Mr. Geddes, was this: We have to draw out so much water with\r\nour manure, under any circumstances, that we should try to have it as\r\nrich as possible. It is certainly true, that, _if_ the manure from a ton\r\nof straw is worth $3, that from a ton of clover-hay, is worth $10. And\r\nit costs no more to draw out and spread the one than the other. I have\r\nnever yet found a farmer who would believe that a ton of clover-hay,\r\nrotted down in the barn-yard, would make three or four tons of manure;\r\nbut he would readily assent to the proposition, that it took four or\r\nfive tons of green clover to make a ton of hay; and that if these four\r\nor five tons of green-clover were rotted in the yard, it would make\r\nthree or four tons of manure. And yet, the only difference between the\r\ngreen-clover and the hay, is, that the latter has lost some 60 or 70 per\r\ncent of water in curing. Add that amount of water to the hay, and it\r\nwill make as much manure as the green-clover from which the hay was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYPSUM AND CLOVER AS MANURE.\r\n\r\nA good farmer came in while we were talking. “Nothing like plaster and\r\nclover,” he said, “for keeping up a wheat-farm.” And you will find this\r\nthe general opinion of nearly all American wheat-growers. It must be\r\naccepted as a fact. But the deductions drawn from the fact are as\r\nvarious as they are numerous.\r\n\r\nLet us look first at the fact. And, if you like, we will take my own\r\nfarm as an example. About 60 years ago, it was covered with the primeval\r\nforest. The trees, on the higher and drier land, were first cut down,\r\nand many of them burnt on the land. Wheat was sown among the stumps. The\r\ncrop varied in different years, from 10 to 30 bushels per acre. When 30\r\nbushels were grown, the fact was remembered. When 10 bushels only were\r\ngrown, little was said about it in after years, until now there is a\r\ngeneral impression that our wheat crops were formerly much larger per\r\nacre than now. I doubt it; but we will not discuss the point. One thing\r\nis certain, the land would produce good crops of clover; and when this\r\nclover was plowed under for manure, we got better crops of wheat\r\nafterwards. This was the rule. Later, we commenced to use gypsum as a\r\ntop-dressing on clover. The effect was often wonderful. Farmers will\r\ntell you that they sowed 200 lbs. of plaster per acre, on their young\r\nclover, in the spring, and it _doubled the crop_. This statement\r\nexpresses an agricultural, and not an arithmetical fact. We do not know\r\nthat the crop on the plastered portion was twice as heavy as on the\r\nunplastered. We know that it was larger, and more luxuriant. There was a\r\ngreater, and more vigorous growth. And this extra growth was caused by\r\nthe small top-dressing of powdered gypsum rock. It was a great fact in\r\nagriculture. I will call it fact, No. 1.\r\n\r\nThen, when the clover was turned under, we usually got good wheat. This\r\nis fact, No. 2. On these two facts, hang many of our agricultural\r\ntheories. We may state these facts in many ways. Still, it all comes to\r\nthis: Clover is good for wheat; plaster is good for clover.\r\n\r\nThere is another fact, which is a matter of general observation and\r\nremark. You rarely find a good farmer who does not pay special attention\r\nto his clover-crop. When I was riding with Mr. Geddes, among the farmers\r\nof Onondaga County, on passing a farm where everything looked\r\nthrifty--good fences, good buildings, good garden, good stock, and the\r\nland clean and in good condition--I would ask who lived there, or some\r\nother question. No matter what. The answer was always the same. “Oh! he\r\nis another of our clover men.” We will call this fact, No. 3.\r\n\r\nAnd when, a year afterwards, Mr. Geddes returned my visit, and I drove\r\nhim around among the farmers of Monroe County, he found precisely the\r\nsame state of facts. All our good farmers were clover men. Among the\r\ngood wheat-growers in Michigan, you will find the same state of things.\r\n\r\nThese are the facts. Let us not quarrel over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEAPEST MANURE A FARMER CAN USE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know who first said, “The cheapest manure a farmer can use\r\nis--clover-seed,” but the saying has become part of our agricultural\r\nliterature, and deserves a passing remark.\r\n\r\nI have heard good farmers in Western New York say, that if they had a\r\nfield sown with wheat that they were going to plow the spring after the\r\ncrop was harvested, they would sow 10 lbs. of clover-seed on the wheat\r\nin the spring. They thought that the growth of the clover in the fall,\r\nafter the wheat was cut, and the growth the next spring, before the land\r\nwas plowed, would afford manure worth much more than the cost of the\r\nclover-seed.\r\n\r\n“I do not doubt it,” said the Deacon; “but would it not be better to let\r\nthe crop grow a few months longer, and then plow it under?”\r\n\r\n“But that is not the point,” I remarked; “we sometimes adopt a rotation\r\nwhen Indian-corn follows a crop of wheat. In such a case, good farmers\r\nsometimes plow the land in the fall, and again the next spring, and then\r\nplant corn. This is one method. But I have known, as I said before, good\r\nfarmers to seed down the wheat with clover; and the following spring,\r\nsay the third week in May, plow under the young clover, and plant\r\nimmediately on the furrow. If the land is warm, and in good condition,\r\nyou will frequently get clover, by this time, a foot high, and will have\r\ntwo or three tons of succulent vegetation to turn under; and the farmer\r\nwho first recommended the practice to me, said that the cut-worms were\r\nso fond of this green-clover that they did not molest the young\r\ncorn-plants. I once tried the plan myself, and found it to work well;\r\nbut since then, I have kept so many pigs and sheep, that clover has been\r\ntoo useful to plow under. But we will not discuss this point at present.\r\n\r\n“What I wanted to say is this: Here we have a field in wheat. Half of it\r\n(A) we seed down with 12 lbs. of clover-seed per acre; the other half\r\n(B) not. The clover-seed and sowing on A, cost, say, $2 per acre. We\r\nplow B in the fall; this will cost us about as much as the clover seed\r\nsown on A. In the spring, A and B are both plowed and planted to corn.\r\nNow, which half of the field will be in the cleanest and best condition,\r\nand which will produce the best corn, and the best barley, or oats,\r\nafterwards?”\r\n\r\n“I vote for A,” said the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“I vote for A,” said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n“I vote for A,” said the Squire.\r\n\r\n“I should think,” modestly suggested Charley, “that it would depend\r\nsomewhat on the soil,” and Charley is right. On a clean, moderately rich\r\npiece of light, sandy soil, I should certainly expect much better corn,\r\nand better barley or oats, on A, where the clover was grown, than on B.\r\nBut if the field was a strong loam, that needed thorough cultivation to\r\nget it mellow enough for corn, I am inclined to think that B would come\r\nout ahead. At any rate, I am sure that on my own farm, moderately stiff\r\nland, if I was going to plant corn after wheat, I should _not_ seed it\r\ndown with clover. I would plow the wheat stubble immediately after\r\nharvest, and harrow and cultivate it to kill the weeds, and then, six\r\nweeks or two months later, I would plow it again. I would draw out\r\nmanure in the winter, pile it up in the field to ferment, and the next\r\nspring spread it, and plow it under, and then--\r\n\r\n“And then what?” asked the Deacon. --“Why the truth is,” said I, “then I\r\nwould not plant corn at all. I should either sow the field to barley, or\r\ndrill in mangel-wurzel or Swede-turnips. But if I _did_ plant corn,\r\nI should expect better corn than if I had sown clover with the wheat;\r\nand the land, if the corn was well cultivated, would be remarkably\r\nclean, and in fine condition; and the next time the land was seeded down\r\nwith clover, we could reasonably expect a great crop.”\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that clover-seed is sometimes a very cheap manure, and\r\nfarmers are in no danger of sowing too much of it. I do not mean sowing\r\ntoo much seed per acre, but they are in no danger of sowing too many\r\nacres with clover. On this point, there is no difference of opinion. It\r\nis only when we come to explain the action of clover--when we draw\r\ndeductions from the facts of the case--that we enter a field bristling\r\nall over with controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n“You have just finished threshing,” said the Deacon, “and for my part,\r\nI would rather hear how your wheat turned out, than to listen to any of\r\nyour chemical talk about nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash.”\r\n\r\n“The wheat,” said I, “turned out full as well as I expected. Fourteen\r\nacres of it was after wheat, and eight acres of it after oats. Both\r\nthese fields were seeded down with clover last year, but the clover\r\nfailed, and there was nothing to be done but to risk them again with\r\nwheat. The remainder was after barley. In all, there was not quite 40\r\nacres, and we had 954 bushels of Diehl wheat. This is not bad in the\r\ncircumstances; but I shall not be content until I can average, taking\r\none year with another, 35 to 40 bushels per acre. If the land had been\r\nrich enough, there would unquestionably have been 40 bushels per acre\r\nthis year. That is to say, the _season_ was quite capable of producing\r\nthis amount; and I think the mechanical condition of the land was also\r\nequal to it; all that was needed was sufficient available plant-food in\r\nthe soil.”\r\n\r\n“I can see no reason,” said the Doctor, “why you may not average 40\r\nbushels of wheat per acre in a good season.”\r\n\r\n“The field of 14 acres,” said I, “where wheat followed wheat, yielded 23\r\nbushels per acre. Last year it yielded 22 bushels per acre; and so we\r\ngot in the two years 45 bushels per acre.”\r\n\r\nThis field has had no manure of any kind for years. In fact, since the\r\nland was cleared, 40 or 50 years ago, I presume that all the manure that\r\nhas been applied would not, in the aggregate, be equal to more than a\r\ngood crop of clover-hay. The available plant-food required to produce\r\nthese two crops of wheat came from the soil itself, and from the rain,\r\ndews, and atmosphere. The land is now seeded down with clover, and with\r\nthe aid of a bushel or two of plaster per acre, next spring, it is not\r\nimprobable that, if mown twice for hay next year, it will yield in the\r\ntwo crops three tons of hay per acre.\r\n\r\nNow, three tons of clover-hay contain about 33 lbs. of phosphoric acid,\r\n90 lbs. of potash, and 150 lbs. of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe last crop of wheat, of 22 bushels per acre, and say 1,500 lbs. of\r\nstraw, would contain:\r\n\r\n                   In the grain.     In the straw.   In total crop.\r\n  Phosphoric acid   11½ lbs.          3¾ lbs.         15¼ lbs.\r\n  Potash             6¾     ”         9¾     ”        16½     ”\r\n  Nitrogen          23      ”         9½     ”        32½     ”\r\n\r\nIt seems very unkind in the wheat-plants not to give me more than 22\r\nbushels per acre, when the clover-plants coming after will find\r\nphosphoric acid enough for 40 bushels of wheat, and potash and nitrogen\r\nenough for nearly 100 bushels of wheat per acre. And these are the three\r\nimportant constituents of plant-food.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, did I get only 22 bushels of wheat per acre? I got 23 bushels\r\non the same land the year previous, and it is not improbable that if I\r\nhad sown the same land to wheat again this fall, I should get 12 or 15\r\nbushels per acre again next year. But the clover will find plant-food\r\nenough for 40 bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\n“There is not much doubt,” said the Deacon, “that you will get a good\r\ncrop of clover, if you will keep the sheep off of the land this fall.\r\nBut I do not see what you mean by the clover-plants finding food enough\r\nfor 40 bushels of wheat, while in point of fact, if you had sown the\r\nfield again to wheat this fall, you would not, as you say, probably get\r\nmore than 12 or 15 bushels of wheat.”\r\n\r\n“He means this,” said the Doctor. “If he had sown the land to wheat this\r\nfall, without manure, he would probably not get over 15 bushels of wheat\r\nper acre, and yet you both agree that the land will, in all probability,\r\nproduce next year, if mown twice, three tons of clover-hay per acre,\r\nwithout any manure.\r\n\r\n“Now, if we admit that the clover gets no more nitrogen from the rain\r\nand dews, and from the atmosphere, than the wheat will get, then it\r\nfollows that this soil, which will only produce 15 bushels of wheat per\r\nacre, does, in point of fact, contain plant-food enough for 40 bushels\r\nof wheat, and the usual proportion of straw.\r\n\r\n“The two crops take up from the soil as follows:\r\n\r\n                              Phosphoric acid.  Potash.    Nitrogen.\r\n  15 bushels wheat and straw     10¼ lbs.       11¼ lbs.    22 lbs.\r\n  3 tons clover-hay              33   ”         90   ”     150  ”\r\n\r\n“These facts and figures,” continued the Doctor, “are worth looking at\r\nand thinking about. Why can not the wheat get as much phosphoric acid\r\nout of the soil as the clover?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” said the Deacon, “the roots of the clover go down deeper into\r\nthe subsoil than the roots of wheat.”\r\n\r\n“That is a very good reason, so far as it goes,” said I, “but does not\r\ninclude all the facts. I have no sort of doubt, that if I had sown this\r\nland to wheat, and put on 75 lbs. of nitrogen per acre, I should have\r\ngot a wheat-crop containing, in grain and straw, 30 lbs. of phosphoric\r\nacid. And so the reason I got 15 bushels of wheat per acre, instead of\r\n40 bushels, is not because the roots of wheat do not go deep enough to\r\nfind sufficient soluble phosphoric acid.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly,” said the Doctor, “the nitrogen you apply may render the\r\nphosphoric acid in the soil more soluble.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” said I; “and this was the answer Liebig gave to Mr.\r\nLawes. Of which more at some future time. But this answer, like the\r\nDeacon’s, does not cover all the facts of the case; for a supply of\r\nsoluble phosphoric acid would not, in all probability, give me a large\r\ncrop of wheat. I will give you some facts presently bearing on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n“What we want to find out is, why the clover can get so much more\r\nphosphoric acid, potash, and nitrogen, than the wheat, from the same\r\nsoil?”\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT CLOVER.\r\n\r\nThe Deacon seemed to think the Doctor was going to give a scientific\r\nanswer to the question. “If the clover _can_ get more nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, and potash, from the same soil than wheat,” said he,\r\n“why not accept the fact, and act accordingly? You scientific gentlemen\r\nwant to explain everything, and sometimes make confusion worse\r\nconfounded. We know that a sheep will grow fat in a pasture where a cow\r\nwould starve.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said the Doctor, “and that is because the cow gathers food with\r\nher tongue, and must have the grass long enough for her to get hold of\r\nit; while a sheep picks up the grass with her teeth and gums, and,\r\nconsequently, the sheep can eat the grass down into the very ground.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said the Deacon; “and how do you know but that the roots of\r\nthe clover gather up their food sheep-fashion, while the wheat-roots eat\r\nlike a cow?”\r\n\r\n“That is not a very scientific way of putting it,” said the Doctor; “but\r\nI am inclined to think the Deacon has the right idea.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, then,” said I, “we had better let it go at that until we get\r\nmore light on the subject. We must conclude that the wheat can not get\r\nfood enough from the soil to yield a maximum crop, not because there is\r\nnot food enough in the field, but the roots of the wheat are so\r\nconstituted that they can not gather it up; while clover-roots, foraging\r\nin the same soil, can find all they want.”\r\n\r\n“Clover,” said the Deacon, “is the scavenger of the farm; like a pig, it\r\ngathers up what would otherwise be wasted.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, these illustrations,” said the Doctor, “do not give us any\r\nclear idea of _how_ the clover-plants take up food. We must recollect\r\nthat the roots of plants take up their food in solution; and it has just\r\noccurred to me that, possibly, Mr. Lawes’ experiments on the amount of\r\nwater given off by plants during their growth, may throw some light on\r\nthe subject we are discussing.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lawes found,” continued the Doctor, “that a wheat-plant, from March\r\n19 to June 28, or 101 days, evaporated through its leaves, etc., 45,713\r\ngrains of water; while a clover-plant, standing alongside, and in\r\nprecisely similar condition, evaporated 55,093 grains. The clover was\r\ncut June 28, when in full bloom. The wheat-plant was allowed to grow\r\nuntil ripe, Sept. 7. From June 28 to Sept. 7, or 72 days, the\r\nwheat-plant evaporated 67,814 grains.”\r\n\r\n“One moment,” said the Deacon; “as I understand, the clover-plant\r\nevaporated more water than the wheat-plant, until the 28th of June, but\r\nthat during the next 71 days, the wheat-plant evaporated more water than\r\nit had during the previous 101 days.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “and if these facts prove nothing else, they at least\r\nshow that there is a great difference between wheat and clover. I was at\r\nRothamsted when these experiments were made. During the first nine days\r\nof the experiment, the clover-plant evaporated 399.6 grains of water;\r\nwhile the wheat-plant, standing alongside, evaporated only 128.7 grains.\r\nIn other words, the clover-plant evaporated three times as much water as\r\nthe wheat-plant. During the next 31 days, the wheat-plant evaporated\r\n1,267.8 grains, and the clover-plant 1,643.0 grains; but during the next\r\n27 days, from April 28 to May 25, the wheat-plant evaporated 162.4\r\ngrains of water per day, while the clover-plant only evaporated 109.2\r\ngrains per day. During the next 34 days, from May 25 to June 28, the\r\nwheat-plant evaporated 1,177.4 grains per day, and the clover-plant\r\n1,473.5 grains per day.”\r\n\r\n“In June,” said the Deacon, “the clover evaporates ten times as much\r\nwater per day as it did in May. How much water would an acre of clover\r\nevaporate?”\r\n\r\n“Let Charley figure it out,” said the Doctor. “Suppose each plant\r\noccupies 10 square inches of land; there are 6,272,640 square inches in\r\nan acre, and, consequently, there would be 627,264 clover-plants on an\r\nacre. Each plant evaporated 1,473.5 grains per day, and there are 7,000\r\ngrains in a pound.”\r\n\r\nCharley made the calculation, and found that an acre of clover, from May\r\n25 to June 28, evaporated 528,598 lbs. of water, or 15,547 lbs. per day.\r\n\r\nA much more accurate way of ascertaining how much water an acre of\r\nclover evaporates is afforded us by these experiments. After the plants\r\nwere cut, they were weighed and analyzed; and it being known exactly how\r\nmuch water each plant had given off during its growth, we have all the\r\nfacts necessary to tell us just how much a crop of a given weight would\r\nevaporate. In brief, it was found that for each pound of dry substance\r\nin the wheat-plant, 247.4 lbs. of water had been evaporated; and for\r\neach pound in the clover-plant, 269.1 lbs.\r\n\r\nAn acre of wheat of 15 bushels per acre of grain, and an equal weight of\r\nstraw, would exhale during the spring and summer 177¾ tons of water, or\r\ncalculated on 172 days, the duration of the experiment, 2,055 lbs. per\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAn acre of clover that would make two tons of hay, would pass off\r\nthrough its leaves, in 101 days, 430 tons of water, or 8,600 lbs. per\r\nday--more than four times as much as the wheat.\r\n\r\nThese figures show that, from an agricultural point of view, there is a\r\ngreat difference between, wheat and clover; and yet I think the figures\r\ndo not show the whole of the difference. The clover was cut just at the\r\ntime when the wheat-plant was entering on its period of most rapid\r\ngrowth and exhalation, and, consequently, the figures given above\r\nprobably exaggerate the amount of water given off by the wheat during\r\nthe early part of the season. It is, at any rate, quite clear, and this\r\nis all I want to show, that an acre of good clover exhales a much larger\r\namount of water from spring to hay-harvest than an acre of wheat.\r\n\r\n“And what,” said the Deacon, who was evidently getting tired of the\r\nfigures, “does all this prove?”\r\n\r\nThe figures prove that clover can drink a much greater quantity of water\r\nduring March, April, May, and June, than wheat; and, consequently, to\r\nget the same amount of food, it is not necessary that the clover should\r\nhave as much nitrogen, phosphoric acid, potash, etc., in the water as\r\nthe wheat-plant requires. I do not know that I make myself understood.\r\n\r\n“You want to show,” said the Deacon, “that the wheat-plant requires\r\nricher food than clover.”\r\n\r\nYes, I want to show that, though clover requires _more_ food per day\r\nthan wheat, yet the clover can drink such a large amount of water, that\r\nit is not necessary to make the “sap of the soil” so rich in nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, and potash, for clover, as it is for wheat. I think\r\nthis tells the whole story.\r\n\r\nClover is, or may be, the grandest renovating and enriching crop\r\ncommonly grown on our farms. It owes its great value, not to any power\r\nit may or may not possess of getting nitrogen from the atmosphere, or\r\nphosphoric acid and potash from the subsoil, but principally, if not\r\nentirely, to the fact that the roots can drink up such a large amount of\r\nwater, and live and thrive on very weak food.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A FARM RICH BY GROWING CLOVER.\r\n\r\nNot by growing the clover, and selling it. Nothing would exhaust the\r\nland so rapidly as such a practice. We must either plow under the\r\nclover, let it rot on the surface, or pasture it, or use it for soiling,\r\nor make it into hay, feed it out to stock, and return the manure to the\r\nland. If clover got its nitrogen from the atmosphere, we might sell the\r\nclover, and depend on the roots left in the ground, to enrich the soil\r\nfor the next crop. But if, as I have endeavored to show, clover gets its\r\nnitrogen from a weak solution in the soil, it is clear, that though for\r\na year or two we might raise good crops from the plant-food left in the\r\nclover-roots, yet we should soon find that growing a crop of clover, and\r\nleaving only the roots in the soil, is no way to permanently enrich\r\nland.\r\n\r\nI do not say that such a practice will “exhaust” the land. Fortunately,\r\nwhile it is an easy matter to impoverish land, we should have to call in\r\nthe aid of the most advanced agricultural science, before we could\r\n“exhaust” land of its plant-food. The free use of Nitrate of Soda, or\r\nSulphate of Ammonia, might enable us to do something in the way of\r\nexhausting our farms, but it would reduce our balance at a bank, or send\r\nus to the poor-house, before we had fully robbed the land of its\r\nplant-food.\r\n\r\nTo exhaust land, by growing and selling clover, is an agricultural\r\nimpossibility, for the simple reason that, long before the soil is\r\nexhausted, the clover would produce such a poverty-stricken crop, that\r\nwe should give up the attempt.\r\n\r\nWe can make our land poor, by growing clover, and selling it; or, we can\r\nmake our land rich, by growing clover, and feeding it out on the farm.\r\nOr, rather, we can make our land rich, by draining it where needed,\r\ncultivating it thoroughly, so as to develope the latent plant-food\r\nexisting in the soil, and then by growing clover to take up and organize\r\nthis plant-food. This is how to make land rich by growing clover. It is\r\nnot, in one sense, the clover that makes the land rich; it is the\r\ndraining and cultivation, that furnishes the food for the clover. The\r\nclover takes up this food and concentrates it. The clover does not\r\ncreate the plant-food; it merely saves it. It is the thorough\r\ncultivation that enriches the land, not the clover.\r\n\r\n“I wish,” writes a distinguished New York gentleman, who has a farm of\r\nbarren sand, “you would tell us whether it is best to let clover ripen\r\nand rot on the surface, or plow it under when in blossom? I have heard\r\nthat it gave more nitrogen to the land to let it ripen and rot on it,\r\nbut as I am no chemist, I do not know.”\r\n\r\nIf, instead of plowing under the clover--say the last of June, it was\r\nleft to grow a month longer, it is quite possible that the clover-roots\r\nand seed would contain more nitrogen than they did a month earlier. It\r\nwas formerly thought that there was a loss of nitrogen during the\r\nripening process, but the evidence is not altogether conclusive on the\r\npoint. Still, if I had a piece of sandy land that I wished to enrich by\r\nclover, I do not think I should plow it under in June, on the one hand,\r\nor let it grow until maturity, and rot down, on the other. I should\r\nrather prefer to mow the crop just as it commenced to blossom, and let\r\nthe clover lie, spread out on the land, as left by the machine. There\r\nwould, I think, be no loss of fertilizing elements by evaporation, while\r\nthe clover-hay would act as a mulch, and the second growth of clover\r\nwould be encouraged by it. Mow this second crop again, about the first\r\nweek in August. Then, unless it was desirable to continue the process\r\nanother year, the land might be plowed up in two or three weeks, turning\r\nunder the two previous crops of clover that are on the surface, together\r\nwith the green-clover still growing. I believe this would be better than\r\nto let the clover exhaust itself by running to seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nDR. VŒLCKER’S EXPERIMENTS ON CLOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, for 1868,\r\nDr. Vœlcker, the able chemist of the Society, and formerly Professor\r\nof Agricultural Chemistry, at the Royal Agricultural College at\r\nCirencester, England, has given us a paper “On the Causes of the\r\nBenefits of Clover, as a preparatory Crop for Wheat.” The paper has been\r\nrepeatedly and extensively quoted in this country, but has not been as\r\ncritically studied as the importance of the subject demands.\r\n\r\n“Never mind all that,” said the Deacon, “tell us what Dr. Vœlcker says.”\r\n\r\n“Here is the paper,” said I, “and Charley will read it to us.” Charley\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n“Agricultural chemists inform us, that in order to maintain the\r\nproductive powers of the land unimpaired, we must restore to it the\r\nphosphoric acid, potash, nitrogen, and other substances, which enter\r\ninto the composition of our farm crops; the constant removal of organic\r\nand inorganic soil constituents, by the crops usually sold off the farm,\r\nleading, as is well known, to more or less rapid deterioration and\r\ngradual exhaustion of the land. Even the best wheat soils of this\r\nand other countries, become more and more impoverished, and sustain a\r\nloss of wheat-yielding power, when corn-crops are grown in too rapid\r\nsuccession without manure. Hence, the universal practice of manuring,\r\nand that also of consuming oil-cake, corn, and similar purchased food on\r\nland naturally poor, or partially exhausted by previous cropping.\r\n\r\n“Whilst, however, it holds good as a general rule, that no soil can be\r\ncropped for any length of time, without gradually becoming more and more\r\ninfertile, if no manure be applied to it, or if the fertilizing elements\r\nremoved by the crops grown thereon, be not by some means or other\r\nrestored, it is, nevertheless, a fact, that after a heavy crop of clover\r\ncarried off as hay, the land, far from being less fertile than before,\r\nis peculiarly well adapted, even without the addition of manure, to bear\r\na good crop of wheat in the following year, provided the season be\r\nfavorable to its growth. This fact, indeed, is so well known, that many\r\nfarmers justly regard the growth of clover as one of the best\r\npreparatory operations which the land can undergo, in order to its\r\nproducing an abundant crop of wheat in the following year. It has\r\nfurther been noticed, that clover mown twice, leaves the land in a\r\nbetter condition, as regards its wheat-producing capabilities, than when\r\nmown once only for hay, and the second crop fed off on the land by\r\nsheep; for, notwithstanding that in the latter instance the fertilizing\r\nelements in the clover-crop are in part restored in the sheep\r\nexcrements, yet, contrary to expectation, this partial restoration of\r\nthe elements of fertility to the land has not the effect of producing\r\nmore or better wheat in the following year, than is reaped on land from\r\noff which the whole clover-crop has been carried, and to which no manure\r\nwhatever has been applied.\r\n\r\n“Again, in the opinion of several good, practical agriculturists, with\r\nwhom I have conversed on the subject, land whereon clover has been grown\r\nfor seed in the preceding year, yields a better crop of wheat than it\r\ndoes when the clover is mown twice for hay, or even only once, and\r\nafterwards fed off by sheep.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think,” said the Deacon, “that this agrees with our experience\r\nhere. A good crop of clover-seed is profitable, but it is thought to be\r\nrather hard on land.”\r\n\r\n“Such,” said I, “is the opinion of John Johnston. He thinks allowing\r\nclover to go to seed, impoverishes the soil.”\r\n\r\nCharley, continued to read:\r\n\r\n“Whatever may be the true explanation of the apparent anomalies\r\nconnected with the growth and chemical history of the clover-plant, the\r\nfacts just mentioned, having been noticed, not once or twice only, or by\r\na solitary observer, but repeatedly, and by numbers of intelligent\r\nfarmers, are certainly entitled to credit; and little wisdom, as it\r\nstrikes me, is displayed by calling them into question, because they\r\nhappen to contradict the prevailing theory, according to which a soil is\r\nsaid to become more or less impoverished, in proportion to the large or\r\nsmall amount of organic and mineral soil constituents carried off in the\r\nproduce.”\r\n\r\n“That is well said,” I remarked, “and very truly; but I will not\r\ninterrupt the reading.”\r\n\r\n“In the course of a long residence,” continues Dr. Vœlcker, “in a purely\r\nagricultural district, I have often been struck with the remarkably\r\nhealthy appearance and good yield of wheat, on land from which a heavy\r\ncrop of clover-hay was obtained in the preceding year. I have likewise\r\nhad frequent opportunities of observing, that, as a rule, wheat grown on\r\npart of a field whereon clover has been twice mown for hay, is better\r\nthan the produce of that on the part of the same field on which the\r\nclover has been mown only once for hay, and afterwards fed off by sheep.\r\nThese observations, extending over a number of years, led me to inquire\r\ninto the reasons why clover is specially well fitted to prepare land for\r\nwheat; and in this paper, I shall endeavor, as the result of my\r\nexperiments on the subject, to give an intelligible explanation of the\r\nfact, that clover is so excellent a preparatory crop for wheat, as it is\r\npractically known to be.\r\n\r\n“By those taking a superficial view of the subject, it may be suggested\r\nthat any injury likely to be caused by the removal of a certain amount\r\nof fertilizing matter, is altogether insignificant, and more than\r\ncompensated for, by the benefit which results from the abundant growth\r\nof clover-roots, and the physical improvement in the soil, which takes\r\nplace in their decomposition. Looking, however, more closely into the\r\nmatter, it will be found that in a good crop of clover-hay, a very\r\nconsiderable amount of both mineral and organic substances is carried\r\noff the land, and that, if the total amount of such constituents in a\r\ncrop had to be regarded exclusively as a measure for determining the\r\nrelative degrees in which different farm crops exhaust the soil, clover\r\nwould have to be described as about the most exhausting crop in the\r\nentire rotation.\r\n\r\n“Clover-hay, on an average, and in round numbers, contains in 100 parts:\r\n\r\n  Water                                       17.0\r\n  Nitrogenous substances,\r\n    (flesh-forming matters)*                  15.6\r\n  Non-nitrogenous compounds                   59.9\r\n  Mineral matter, (ash)                        7.5\r\n                                             -----\r\n                                             100.0\r\n                                             =====\r\n    * Containing nitrogen                      2.5\r\n\r\n“The mineral portion, or ash, in 100 parts of clover-hay, consists of:\r\n\r\n  Phosphoric acid                              7.5\r\n  Sulphuric acid                               4.3\r\n  Carbonic acid                               18.0\r\n  Silica                                       3.0\r\n  Lime                                        30.0\r\n  Magnesia                                     8.5\r\n  Potash                                      20.0\r\n  Soda, chloride of sodium,\r\n    oxide of iron, sand, loss, etc.            8.7\r\n                                             -----\r\n                                             100.0\r\n                                             =====\r\n\r\n“Let us suppose the land to have yielded four tons of clover-hay per\r\nacre.

The restoration of silica, therefore, need\r\nnot trouble us in any way, especially as there is not a single instance\r\non record, proving that silica, even in a soluble condition, has ever\r\nbeen applied to land, with the slightest advantage to corn, or\r\ngrass-crops, which are rich in silica, and which, for this reason, may\r\nbe assumed to be particularly grateful for it in a soluble state.\r\nSilica, indeed, if at all capable of producing a beneficial effect,\r\nought to be useful to these crops, either by strengthening the straw, or\r\nstems of graminaceous plants, or otherwise benefiting them; but, after\r\ndeducting the amount of silica from the total amount of mineral matters\r\nin the wheat produced from one acre, only a trifling quantity of other\r\nand more valuable fertilizing ash constituents of plants will be left.\r\nOn comparing the relative amounts of phosphoric acid, and potash, in an\r\naverage crop of wheat, and a good crop of clover-hay, it will be seen\r\nthat one acre of clover-hay contains as much phosphoric acid, as two and\r\none-half acres of wheat, and as much potash as the produce from five\r\nacres of the same crop. Clover thus unquestionably removes from the land\r\nvery much more mineral matter than does wheat; wheat, notwithstanding,\r\nsucceeds remarkably well after clover.\r\n\r\n“Four tons of clover-hay, or the produce of an acre, contains, as\r\nalready stated, 224 lbs. of nitrogen, or calculated as ammonia, 272 lbs.\r\n\r\n“Assuming the grain of wheat to furnish 1.78 per cent of nitrogen, and\r\nwheat-straw, .64 per cent, and assuming also that 1,500 lbs. of corn,\r\nand 3,000 lbs. of straw, represent the average produce per acre, there\r\nwill be in the grain of wheat, per acre, 26.7 lbs. of nitrogen, and in\r\nthe straw, 19.2 lbs., or in both together, 46 lbs. of nitrogen; in round\r\nnumbers, equal to about 55 lbs. of ammonia, which is only about\r\none-fifth the quantity of nitrogen in the produce of an acre of clover.\r\nWheat, it is well known, is specially benefited by the application of\r\nnitrogenous manures, and as clover carries off so large a quantity of\r\nnitrogen, it is natural to expect the yield of wheat, after clover, to\r\nfall short of what the land might be presumed to produce without manure,\r\nbefore a crop of clover was taken from it. Experience, however, has\r\nproved the fallacy of this presumption, for the result is exactly the\r\nopposite, inasmuch as a better and heavier crop of wheat is produced\r\nthan without the intercalation of clover. What, it may be asked, is the\r\nexplanation of this apparent anomaly?\r\n\r\n“In taking up this inquiry, I was led to pass in review the celebrated\r\nand highly important experiments, undertaken by Mr. Lawes and Dr.\r\nGilbert, on the continued growth of wheat on the same soil, for a long\r\nsuccession of years, and to examine, likewise carefully, many points, to\r\nwhich attention is drawn, by the same authors in their memoirs on the\r\ngrowth of red clover by different manures, and on the Lois Weedon plan\r\nof growing wheat. Abundant and most convincing evidence is supplied by\r\nthese indefatigable experimenters, that the wheat-producing powers of a\r\nsoil are not increased in any sensible degree by the liberal supply of\r\nall the mineral matters, which enter into the composition of the ash of\r\nwheat, and that the abstraction of these mineral matters from the soil,\r\nin any much larger proportions than can possibly take place under\r\nordinary cultivation, in no wise affects the yield of wheat, provided\r\nthere be at the same time a liberal supply of available nitrogen within\r\nthe soil itself. The amount of the latter, therefore, is regarded by\r\nMessrs. Lawes and Gilbert, as the measure of the increased produce of\r\ngrain which a soil furnishes.\r\n\r\n“In conformity with these views, the farmer, when he wishes to increase\r\nthe yield of his wheat, finds it to his advantage to have recourse to\r\nammoniacal, or other nitrogenous manures, and depends more or less\r\nentirely upon the soil, for the supply of the necessary mineral or\r\nash-constituents of wheat, having found such a supply to be amply\r\nsufficient for his requirements. As far, therefore, as the removal from\r\nthe soil of a large amount of mineral soil-constituents, by the\r\nclover-crop, is concerned, the fact viewed in the light of the\r\nRothamsted experiments, becomes at once intelligible; for,\r\nnotwithstanding the abstraction of over 600 lbs. of mineral matter by a\r\ncrop of clover, the succeeding wheat-crop does not suffer. Inasmuch,\r\nhowever, as we have seen, that not only much mineral matter is carried\r\noff the land in a crop of clover, but also much nitrogen, we might, in\r\nthe absence of direct evidence to the contrary, be led to suspect that\r\nwheat, after clover, would not be a good crop; whereas, the fact is\r\nexactly the reverse.\r\n\r\n“It is worthy of notice, that nitrogenous manures, which have such a\r\nmarked and beneficial effect upon wheat, do no good, but in certain\r\ncombinations, in some seasons, do positive harm to clover. Thus, Messrs.\r\nLawes and Gilbert, in a series of experiments on the growth of\r\nred-clover, by different manures, obtained 14 tons of fresh green\r\nproduce, equal to about three and three-fourths tons of clover hay, from\r\nthe unmanured portion of the experimental field; and where sulphates of\r\npotash, soda, and magnesia, or sulphate of potash and superphosphate of\r\nlime were employed, 17 to 18 tons, (equal to from about four and\r\none-half to nearly five tons of hay), were obtained. When salts of\r\nammonia were added to the mineral manures, the produce of clover-hay\r\nwas, upon the whole, less than where the mineral manures were used\r\nalone. The wheat, grown after the clover, on the unmanured plot, gave,\r\nhowever, 29½ bushels of corn, whilst in the adjoining field, where wheat\r\nwas grown after wheat, without manure, only 15½ bushels of corn per acre\r\nwere obtained. Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert notice especially, that in the\r\nclover-crop of the preceding year, very much larger quantities, both of\r\nmineral matters and of nitrogen, were taken from the land, than were\r\nremoved in the unmanured wheat-crop in the same year, in the adjoining\r\nfield. Notwithstanding this, the soil from which the clover had been\r\ntaken, was in a condition to yield 14 bushels more wheat, per acre, than\r\nthat upon which wheat had been previously grown; the yield of wheat,\r\nafter clover, in these experiments, being fully equal to that in another\r\nfield, where large quantities of manure were used.\r\n\r\n“Taking all these circumstances into account, is there not presumptive\r\nevidence, that, notwithstanding the removal of a large amount of\r\nnitrogen in the clover-hay, an abundant store of available nitrogen is\r\nleft in the soil, and also that in its relations towards nitrogen in the\r\nsoil, clover differs essentially from wheat? The results of our\r\nexperience in the growth of the two crops, appear to indicate that,\r\nwhereas the growth of the wheat rapidly exhausts the land of its\r\navailable nitrogen, that of clover, on the contrary, tends somehow or\r\nother to accumulate nitrogen within the soil itself. If this can be\r\nshown to be the case, an intelligible explanation of the fact that\r\nclover is so useful as a preparatory crop for wheat, will be found in\r\nthe circumstance, that, during the growth of clover, nitrogenous food,\r\nfor which wheat is particularly grateful, is either stored up or\r\nrendered available in the soil.\r\n\r\n“An explanation, however plausible, can hardly be accepted as correct,\r\nif based mainly on data, which, although highly probable, are not proved\r\nto be based on fact. In chemical inquiries, especially, nothing must be\r\ntaken for granted, that has not been proved by direct experiment. The\r\nfollowing questions naturally suggest themselves in reference to this\r\nsubject: What is the amount of nitrogen in soils of different\r\ncharacters? What is the amount more particularly after a good, and after\r\nan indifferent crop of clover? Why is the amount of nitrogen in soils,\r\nlarger after clover, than after wheat and other crops? Is the nitrogen\r\npresent in a condition in which it is available and useful to wheat? And\r\nlastly, are there any other circumstances, apart from the supply of\r\nnitrogenous matter in the soil, which help to account for the beneficial\r\neffects of clover as a preparatory crop for wheat?\r\n\r\n“In order to throw some light on these questions, and, if possible, to\r\ngive distinct answers to at least some of them, I, years ago, when\r\nresiding at Cirencester, began a series of experiments; and more\r\nrecently, I have been fortunate enough to obtain the co-operation of Mr.\r\nRobert Valentine, of Leighton Buzzard, who kindly undertook to supply me\r\nwith materials for my analysis.\r\n\r\n“My first experiments were made on a thin, calcareous, clay soil,\r\nresting on oolitic limestone, and producing generally a fair crop of\r\nred-clover. The clover-field formed the slope of a rather steep hillock,\r\nand varied much in depth. At the top of the hill, the soil became very\r\nstony at a depth of four inches, so that it could only with difficulty\r\nbe excavated to a depth of six inches, when the bare limestone-rock made\r\nits appearance. At the bottom of the field the soil was much deeper, and\r\nthe clover stronger, than at the upper part. On the brow of the hill,\r\nwhere the clover appeared to be strong, a square yard was measured out;\r\nand at a little distance off, where the clover was very bad, a second\r\nsquare yard was measured; in both plots, the soil being taken up to a\r\ndepth of six inches. The soil, where the clover was good, may be\r\ndistinguished from the other, by being marked as No. 1, and that where\r\nit was bad, as No. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOVER-SOIL NO. 1.

Clover-roots, washed quite\r\nclean, and separated from all soil, yield about five per cent of ash;\r\nbut it is extremely difficult to clean a large quantity of fibrous roots\r\nfrom all dirt, and the preceding analysis distinctly shows, that the ash\r\nof the clover-roots, analyzed by me, was mechanically mixed with a good\r\ndeal of fine soil, for oxide of iron, and alumina, and insoluble\r\nsilicious matter in any quantity, are not normal constituents of\r\nplant-ashes. Making allowance for soil contamination, the ash of\r\nclover-roots, it will be noticed, contains much lime and potash, as well\r\nas an appreciable amount of phosphoric and sulphuric acid. On the decay\r\nof the clover-roots, these and other mineral fertilizing matters are\r\nleft in the surface-soil in a readily available condition, and in\r\nconsiderable proportions, when the clover stands well. Although a crop\r\nof clover removes much mineral matter from the soil, it must be borne in\r\nmind, that its roots extract from the land, soluble mineral fertilizing\r\nmatters, which, on the decay of the roots, remain in the land in a\r\nprepared and more readily available form, than that in which they\r\noriginally occur. The benefits arising to wheat, from the growth of\r\nclover, may thus be due partly to this preparation and concentration of\r\nmineral food in the surface-soil.\r\n\r\n“The clover on the hillside field, on the whole, turned out a very good\r\ncrop; and, as the plant stood the winter well, and this field was left\r\nanother season in clover, without being plowed up, I availed myself of\r\nthe opportunity of making, during the following season, a number of\r\nexperiments similar to those of the preceding year. This time, however,\r\nI selected for examination, a square yard of soil, from a spot on the\r\nbrow of the hill, where the clover was thin, and the soil itself stony\r\nat a depth of four inches; and another plot of one square yard at the\r\nbottom of the hill, from a place where the clover was stronger than that\r\non the brow of the hill, and the soil at a depth of six inches contained\r\nno large stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL NO. 1.

The weather was very warm, from the time of\r\ncutting until the clover was carted, the thermometer standing at 80\r\nFahr. every day. The clover was turned in the swath, on the second day\r\nafter it was cut; on the fourth day, it was turned over and put into\r\nsmall heaps of about 10 lbs. each; and on the fifth day, these were\r\ncollected into larger cocks, and then stacked.\r\n\r\n“The best part of an 11-acre field, produced nearly three tons of\r\nclover-hay, sun-dried, per acre; the whole field yielding on an average,\r\n2½ tons per acre. This result was obtained by weighing the stack three\r\nmonths after the clover was carted. The second crop was cut on the 21st\r\nof August, and carried on the 27th, the weight being nearly 30 cwt. of\r\nhay per acre. Thus the two cuttings produced just about four tons of\r\nclover-hay per acre.\r\n\r\n“The 11 acres were divided into two parts. About one-half was mown for\r\nhay a second time, and the other part left for seed. The produce of the\r\nsecond half of the 11-acre field, was cut on the 8th of October, and\r\ncarried on the 10th. It yielded in round numbers, 3 cwt. of clover-seed\r\nper acre, the season being very unfavorable for clover-seed.

However, when calculated to the acre, we find that\r\nsix inches of surface soil in an acre of land, actually contain over two\r\ntons of phosphoric acid. An average crop of wheat, assumed to be 25\r\nbushels of grain, at 60 lbs. per bushel, and 3,000 lbs. of straw,\r\nremoves from the land on which it is grown, 20 lbs. of phosphoric acid.\r\nThe clover-soil analyzed by me, consequently contains an amount of\r\nphosphoric acid in a depth of only six inches, which is equal to that\r\npresent in 247½ average crops of wheat; or supposing that, by good\r\ncultivation and in favorable seasons, the average yield of wheat could\r\nbe doubled, and 50 bushels of grain, at 60 lbs. a bushel, and 6,000 lbs.\r\nof straw could be raised, 124 of such heavy wheat-crops would contain no\r\nmore phosphoric acid than actually occurred in six inches of this\r\nclover-soil per acre.\r\n\r\n“The mere presence of such an amount of phosphoric acid in a soil,\r\nhowever, by no means proves its sufficiency for the production of so\r\nmany crops of wheat; for, in the first place, it can not be shown that\r\nthe whole of the phosphoric acid found by analysis, occurs in the soil\r\nin a readily available combination; and, in the second place, it is\r\nquite certain that the root-fibres of the wheat-plant can not reach and\r\npick up, so to speak, every particle of phosphoric acid, even supposing\r\nit to occur in the soil in a form most conducive to ‘ready assimilation\r\nby the plant.’\r\n\r\n“The calculation is not given in proof of a conclusion which would be\r\nmanifestly absurd, but simply as an illustration of the enormous\r\nquantity in an acre of soil six inches deep, of a constituent forming\r\nthe smaller proportions of the whole weight of an acre of soil of that\r\nlimited depth. It shows the existence of a practically unlimited amount\r\nof the most important mineral constituents of plants, and clearly points\r\nout the propriety of rendering available to plants, the natural\r\nresources of the soil in plant-food; to draw, in fact, up the mineral\r\nwealth of the soil, by thoroughly working the land, and not leaving it\r\nunutilized as so much dead capital.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the Deacon, “that is the right doctrine.”\r\n\r\n“The roots,” continues Dr. Vœlcker, “from one square foot of soil were\r\ncleaned as much as possible, dried completely at 212°, and in that state\r\nweighed 240 grains.

In 64.76 of organic matter, we have here 1.702 of nitrogen,\r\nwhereas, in the case of the roots from the part of the field where the\r\nclover was twice mown for hay, we have in 81.33 parts, that is, much\r\nmore organic matter, and 1.635, or rather less of nitrogen. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that the organic matter in the soil after\r\nclover-seed, occurs in a more advanced stage of decomposition, than\r\nfound in the clover-roots from the part of the field twice mown. In the\r\nmanure, in which the decay of such and similar organic remains proceeds,\r\nmuch of the non-nitrogenous, or carbonaceous matters, of which these\r\nremains chiefly, though not entirely, consist, is transformed into\r\ngaseous carbonic acid, and what remains behind, becomes richer in\r\nnitrogen and mineral matters. A parallel case, showing the dissipation\r\nof carbonaceous matter, and the increase in the percentage of nitrogen\r\nand mineral matter in what is left behind, is presented to us in fresh\r\nand rotten dung; in long or fresh dung, the percentage of organic\r\nmatter, consisting chiefly of very imperfectly decomposed straw, being\r\nlarger, and that of nitrogen and mineral matter smaller, than in\r\nwell-rotted dung.\r\n\r\n“The roots from the field after clover-seed, it will be borne in mind,\r\nwere dug up in November, whilst those obtained from the land twice mown,\r\nwere dug up in September; the former, therefore, may be expected to be\r\nin a more advanced state of decay than the latter, and richer in\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n“In an acre of soil, after clover-seed, we have:\r\n\r\n                                                 Lbs.\r\n  Nitrogen in first six inches of soil          4,725\r\n  Nitrogen in roots                                51½\r\n  Nitrogen in second six inches of soil         3,350\r\n                                                -------\r\n    Total amount of nitrogen, per acre, in\r\n      twelve inches of soil                     8,126½\r\n                                                =======\r\n\r\n“Equal to ammonia, 9,867 lbs.: or, in round numbers, 3 tons and 12½\r\ncwts. of nitrogen per acre; equal to 4 tons 8 cwts. of ammonia.\r\n\r\n“This is a very much larger amount of nitrogen than occurred in the\r\nother soil, and shows plainly that the total amount of nitrogen\r\naccumulates especially in the surface-soil, when clover is grown for\r\nseed; thus explaining intelligibly, as it appears to me, why wheat, as\r\nstated by many practical men, succeeds better on land where clover is\r\ngrown for seed, than where it is mown for hay.\r\n\r\n“All the three layers of the soil, after clover-seed, are richer in\r\nnitrogen than the same sections of the soil where the clover was twice\r\nmown, as will be seen by the following comparative statement of results:\r\n\r\n  --------------+--------------------------+--------------------------\r\n                |           I.             |            II.\r\n                |    Clover-Soil twice     |  Clover-Soil once mown\r\n                |        mown.             |  and then left for seed.\r\n                +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n                | Upper  | Second | Third  | Upper  |  Next  | Lowest\r\n                |6 inches|6 inches|6 inches|6 inches|6 inches|6 inches\r\n  --------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Percentage of |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n    nitrogen in |  .168  |  .092  |  .064  |  .189  |  .134  |  .089\r\n    dried soil  |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n  Equal to      |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n    ammonia     |  .198  |  .112  |  .078  |  .229  |  .162  |  .108\r\n  --------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n“This difference in the amount of accumulated nitrogen in clover-land,\r\nappears still more strikingly on comparing the total amounts of nitrogen\r\nper acre in the different sections of the two portions of the 11-acre\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n  Percentage of Nitrogen Per Acre.\r\n\r\n                               First six  Second       Third six\r\n                               inches.    six inches.  inches.\r\n                               Lbs.

It has been shown\r\nlikewise, that the removal from the soil of a large amount of mineral\r\nmatter in a good clover-crop, in conformity with many direct field\r\nexperiments, is not likely in any degree to affect the wheat-crop, and\r\nthat the yield of wheat on soils under ordinary cultivation, according\r\nto the experience of many farmers, and the direct and numerous\r\nexperiments of Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert, rises or falls, other\r\ncircumstances being equal, with the supply of available nitrogenous food\r\nwhich is given to the wheat. This being the case, we can not doubt that\r\nthe benefits arising from the growth of clover to the succeeding wheat,\r\nare mainly due to the fact that an immense amount of nitrogenous food\r\naccumulates in the soil during the growth of clover.\r\n\r\n“This accumulation of nitrogenous plant-food, specially useful to cereal\r\ncrops, is, as shown in the preceding experiments, much greater when\r\nclover is grown for seed, than when it is made into hay. This affords an\r\nintelligible explanation of a fact long observed by good practical men,\r\nalthough denied by others who decline to accept their experience as\r\nresting upon trustworthy evidence, because, as they say, land cannot\r\nbecome more fertile when a crop is grown upon it for seed, which is\r\ncarried off, than when that crop is cut down and the produce consumed on\r\nthe land. The chemical points brought forward in the course of this\r\ninquiry, show plainly that mere speculation as to what can take place in\r\na soil, and what not, do not much advance the true theory of certain\r\nagricultural practices. It is only by carefully investigating subjects\r\nlike the one under consideration, that positive proofs are given,\r\nshowing the correctness of intelligent observers in the fields. Many\r\nyears ago, I made a great many experiments relative to the chemistry of\r\nfarm-yard manure, and then showed, amongst other particulars, that\r\nmanure, spread at once on the land, need not there and then be plowed\r\nin, inasmuch as neither a broiling sun, nor a sweeping and drying wind\r\nwill cause the slightest loss of ammonia; and that, therefore, the\r\nold-fashioned farmer who carts his manure on the land as soon as he can,\r\nand spreads it at once, but who plows it in at his convenience, acts in\r\nperfect accordance with correct chemical principles involved in the\r\nmanagement of farm-yard manure. On the present occasion, my main object\r\nhas been to show, not merely by reasoning on the subject, but by actual\r\nexperiments, that the larger the amounts of nitrogen, potash, soda,\r\nlime, phosphoric acid, etc., which are removed from the land in a\r\nclover-crop, the better it is, nevertheless, made thereby for producing\r\nin the succeeding year an abundant crop of wheat, other circumstances\r\nbeing favorable to its growth.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, no kind of manure can be compared in point of efficacy for\r\nwheat, to the manuring which the land gets in a really good crop of\r\nclover. The farmer who wishes to derive the full benefit from his\r\nclover-lay, should plow it up for wheat as soon as possible in the\r\nautumn, and leave it in a rough state as long as is admissible, in order\r\nthat the air may find free access into the land, and the organic remains\r\nleft in so much abundance in a good crop of clover be changed into\r\nplant-food; more especially, in other words, in order that the crude\r\nnitrogenous organic matter in the clover-roots and decaying leaves, may\r\nhave time to become transformed into ammoniacal compounds, and these, in\r\nthe course of time, into nitrates, which I am strongly inclined to think\r\nis the form in which nitrogen is assimilated, par excellence by cereal\r\ncrops, and in which, at all events, it is more efficacious than in any\r\nother state of combination wherein it may be used as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\n“When the clover-lay is plowed up early, the decay of the clover is\r\nsufficiently advanced by the time the young wheat-plant stands in need\r\nof readily available nitrogenous food, and this being uniformly\r\ndistributed through the whole of the cultivated soil, is ready to\r\nbenefit every single plant. This equal and abundant distribution of\r\nfood, peculiarly valuable to cereals, is a great advantage, and speaks\r\nstrongly in favor of clover as a preparatory crop for wheat.\r\n\r\n“Nitrate of soda, an excellent spring top-dressing for wheat and cereals\r\nin general, in some seasons fails to produce as good an effect as in\r\nothers. In very dry springs, the rainfall is not sufficient to wash it\r\nproperly into the soil and to distribute it equally, and in very wet\r\nseasons it is apt to be washed either into the drains or into a stratum\r\nof the soil not accessible to the roots of the young wheat. As,\r\ntherefore, the character of the approaching season can not usually be\r\npredicted, the application of nitrate of soda to wheat is always\r\nattended with more or less uncertainty.\r\n\r\n“The case is different, when a good crop of clover-hay has been obtained\r\nfrom the land on which wheat is intended to be grown afterwards. An\r\nenormous quantity of nitrogenous organic matter, as we have seen, is\r\nleft in the land after the removal of the clover-crop; and these remains\r\ngradually decay and furnish ammonia, which at first and during the\r\ncolder months of the year, is retained by the well known absorbing\r\nproperties which all good wheat-soils possess. In spring, when warmer\r\nweather sets in, and the wheat begins to make a push, these ammonia\r\ncompounds in the soil are by degrees oxidized into nitrates; and as this\r\nchange into food peculiarly favorable to young cereal plants, proceeds\r\nslowly but steadily, we have in the soil itself, after clover, a source\r\nfrom which nitrates are continuously produced; so that it does not much\r\naffect the final yield of wheat, whether heavy rains remove some or all\r\nof the nitrate present in the soil. The clover remains thus afford a\r\nmore continuous source from which nitrates are produced, and greater\r\ncertainty for a good crop of wheat than when recourse is had to\r\nnitrogenous top-dressings in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n“The following are some of the chief points of interest which I have\r\nendeavored fully to develope in the preceding pages:\r\n\r\n“1. A good crop of clover removes from the soil more potash, phosphoric\r\nacid, lime, and other mineral matters, which enter into the composition\r\nof the ashes of our cultivated crops, than any other crop usually grown\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\n“2. There is fully three times as much nitrogen in a crop of clover as\r\nin the average produce of the grain and straw of wheat per acre.\r\n\r\n“3. Notwithstanding the large amount of nitrogenous matter and of\r\nash-constituents of plants, in the produce of an acre, clover is an\r\nexcellent preparatory crop for wheat.\r\n\r\n“4. During the growth of clover, a large amount of nitrogenous matter\r\naccumulates in the soil.\r\n\r\n“5. This accumulation, which is greatest in the surface soil, is due to\r\ndecaying leaves dropped during the growth of clover, and to an abundance\r\nof roots, containing, when dry, from one and three-fourths to two per\r\ncent of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n“6. The clover-roots are stronger and more numerous, and more leaves\r\nfall on the ground when clover is grown for seed, than when it is mown\r\nfor hay; in consequence, more nitrogen is left after clover-seed, than\r\nafter hay, which accounts for wheat yielding a better crop after\r\nclover-seed than after hay.\r\n\r\n“7. The development of roots being checked, when the produce, in a green\r\ncondition, is fed off by sheep, in all probability, leaves still less\r\nnitrogenous matter in the soil than when clover is allowed to get riper\r\nand is mown for hay; thus, no doubt, accounting for the observation made\r\nby practical men, that, notwithstanding the return of the produce in the\r\nsheep excrements, wheat is generally stronger, and yields better, after\r\nclover mown for hay, than when the clover is fed off green by sheep.\r\n\r\n“8. The nitrogenous matters in the clover remains, on their gradual\r\ndecay, are finally transformed into nitrates, thus affording a\r\ncontinuous source of food on which cereal crops specially delight to\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\n“9. There is strong presumptive evidence that the nitrogen which exists\r\nin the air, in shape of ammonia and nitric acid, and descends, in these\r\ncombinations, with the rain which falls on the ground, satisfies, under\r\nordinary circumstances, the requirements of the clover-crop. This crop\r\ncauses a large accumulation of nitrogenous matters, which are gradually\r\nchanged in the soil into nitrates. The atmosphere thus furnishes\r\nnitrogenous food to the succeeding wheat indirectly, and, so to say,\r\ngratis.\r\n\r\n“10. Clover not only provides abundance of nitrogenous food, but\r\ndelivers this food in a readily available form (as nitrates), more\r\ngradually and continuously, and, consequently, with more certainty of a\r\ngood result, than such food can be applied to the land in the shape of\r\nnitrogenous spring top-dressings.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Thank you Charley,” said the Doctor, “_that is the most remarkable\r\npaper I ever listened to_. I do not quite know what to think of it. We\r\nshall have to examine it carefully.”\r\n\r\n“The first three propositions in the Summary,” said I, “are\r\nunquestionably true. Proposition No. 4, is equally true, but we must be\r\ncareful what meaning we attach to the word ‘accumulate.’ The idea is,\r\nthat clover gathers up the nitrogen in the soil. It does not _increase_\r\nthe absolute amount of nitrogen. It accumulates it--brings it together.\r\n\r\n“Proposition No. 5, will not be disputed; and I think we may accept No.\r\n6, also, though we can not be sure that allowing clover to go to seed,\r\nhad anything to do with the increased quantity of clover-roots.\r\n\r\n“Proposition No. 7, may or may not be true. We have no proof, only a\r\n‘probability;’ and the same may be said in regard to propositions Nos.\r\n8, 9, and 10.”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon seemed uneasy. He did not like these remarks. He had got the\r\nimpression, while Charley was reading, that much more was proved than\r\nDr. Vœlcker claims in his Summary.\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said he, “that on the part of the field where the clover\r\nwas allowed to go to seed, Dr. Vœlcker found a great increase in the\r\namount of nitrogen.”\r\n\r\n“That seems to be the general impression,” said the Doctor, “but in\r\npoint of fact, we have no proof that the growth of clover, either for\r\nhay or for seed, had anything to do with the quantity of nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid found in the soil. The _facts_ given by Dr. Vœlcker, are\r\nexceedingly interesting. Let us look at them:\r\n\r\n“A field of 11 acres was sown to winter-wheat, and seeded down in the\r\nspring, with 13 lbs. per acre of clover. The wheat yielded 40 bushels\r\nper acre. The next year, on the 25th of June, the clover was mown for\r\nhay. We are told that ‘the _best part_ of the field yielded three tons\r\n(6,720 lbs.) of clover-hay per acre; the whole field averaging 2½ tons\r\n(5,600 lbs.) per acre.’\r\n\r\n“We are not informed how much land there was of the ‘best part,’ but\r\nassuming that it was half the field, the poorer part must have yielded\r\nonly 4,480 lbs. of hay per acre, or only two-thirds as much as the\r\nother. This shows that there was considerable difference in the quality\r\nor condition of the land.\r\n\r\n“After the field was mown for hay, it was divided into two parts: one\r\npart was mown again for hay, August 21st, and yielded about 30 cwt.\r\n(3,360 lbs.) of hay per acre; the other half was allowed to grow six or\r\nseven weeks longer, and was then (October 8th), cut for seed. The yield\r\nwas a little over 5½ bushels of seed per acre. Whether the clover\r\nallowed to grow for seed, was on the richer or poorer half of the field,\r\nwe are not informed.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Vœlcker then analyzed the soil. That from the part of the field\r\nmown twice for hay, contained per acre:\r\n\r\n                    First six   Second six   Third six   Total, 18\r\n                    inches.     inches.      inches.    inches deep.\r\n  Phosphoric acid    4,950       2,725        3,575      11,250\r\n  Nitrogen           3,350       1,875        1,325       6,550\r\n\r\n“The soil _from the part mown once for hay, and then for seed_,\r\ncontained per acre:\r\n\r\n                     First six   Second six   Third six   Total, 18\r\n                     inches.     inches.      inches.    inches deep.\r\n  Phosphoric acid     3,975       4,150        3,500      11,625\r\n  Nitrogen            4,725       3,350        2,225      10,300\r\n\r\n“Dr. Vœlcker also ascertained the amount and composition of the\r\nclover-_roots_ growing in the soil on the two parts of the field. On the\r\n_part mown twice for hay_, the roots contained per acre 24½ lbs. of\r\nnitrogen. On the _part mown once for hay, and then for seed_, the roots\r\ncontained 51½ lbs. of nitrogen per acre.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the Doctor, “these facts are very interesting, _but there is\r\nno sort of evidence tending to show that the clover has anything to do\r\nwith increasing or decreasing the quantity of nitrogen or phosphoric\r\nacid found in the soil_.”\r\n\r\n“There was more clover-roots per acre, where the clover was allowed to\r\ngo to seed. But that may be because the soil happened to be richer on\r\nthis part of the field. There was, in the first six inches of the soil,\r\n3,350 lbs. of nitrogen per acre, on one-half of the field, and 4,725\r\nlbs. on the other half; and it is not at all surprising that on the\r\nlatter half there should be a greater growth of clover and clover-roots.\r\nTo suppose that during the six or seven weeks while the clover was\r\nmaturing its seed, the clover-plants could accumulate 1,375 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen, is absurd.”\r\n\r\n“But Dr. Vœlcker,” said the Deacon, “states, and states truly, that\r\n‘more leaves fall on the ground when clover is grown for seed, than when\r\nit is mown for hay; and, consequently, more nitrogen is left after\r\nclover-seed than after hay, which accounts for wheat yielding a better\r\ncrop after clover-seed than after hay.’”\r\n\r\n“This is all true,” said the Doctor, “but we can not accept Dr.\r\nVœlcker’s analyses as proving it. To account in this way for the 1,375\r\nlbs. of nitrogen, we should have to suppose that the clover-plants, in\r\ngoing to seed, shed _one hundred tons_ of dry clover-leaves per acre!\r\nThe truth of the matter seems to be, that the part of the field on which\r\nthe clover was allowed to go to seed, was naturally much richer than the\r\nother part, and consequently produced a greater growth of clover and\r\nclover-roots.”\r\n\r\nWe can not find anything in these experiments tending to show that we\r\ncan make land rich by growing clover and selling the crop. The analyses\r\nof the soil show that in the first eighteen inches of the surface-soil,\r\nthere was 6,550 lbs. of nitrogen per acre, on one part of the field, and\r\n10,300 lbs. on the other part. The clover did not create this nitrogen,\r\nor bring it from the atmosphere. The wheat with which the clover was\r\nseeded down, yielded 40 bushels per acre. If the field had been sown to\r\nwheat again, it probably would not have yielded over 25 bushels per\r\nacre--and that for want of available nitrogen. And yet the clover got\r\nnitrogen enough for over four tons of clover-hay; or as much nitrogen as\r\na crop of wheat of 125 bushels per acre, and 7½ tons of straw would\r\nremove from the land.\r\n\r\nNow what does this prove? There was, in 18 inches of the soil on the\r\npoorest part of the field, 6,550 lbs. of nitrogen per acre. A crop of\r\nwheat of 50 bushels per acre, and twice that weight of straw, would\r\nrequire about 92 lbs. of nitrogen. But the wheat can not get this amount\r\nfrom the soil, while the clover can get _double the quantity_. And the\r\nonly explanation I can give, is, that the clover-roots can take up\r\nnitrogen from a weaker solution in the soil than wheat-roots can.\r\n\r\n\r\n“These experiments of Dr. Vœlcker,” said I, “give me great\r\nencouragement. Here is a soil, ‘originally rather unproductive, but much\r\nimproved by deep culture; by being smashed up into rough clods early in\r\nautumn, and by being exposed in this state to the crumbling effects of\r\nthe air.’ It now produces 40 bushels of wheat per acre, and part of the\r\nfield yielded three tons of clover-hay, per acre, the first cutting, and\r\n5½ bushels of clover-seed afterwards--and that in a very unfavorable\r\nseason for clover-seed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will find that the farmers in England do not expect to make their\r\nland rich, by growing clover and selling the produce. After they have\r\ngot their land rich, by good cultivation, and the liberal use of animal\r\nand artificial manures, they may expect a good crop of wheat from the\r\nroots of the clover. But they take good care to feed out the clover\r\nitself on the farm, in connection with turnips and oil-cake, and thus\r\nmake rich manure.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is in this country. Much as we hear about the value of clover\r\nfor manure, even those who extol it the highest do not depend upon it\r\nalone for bringing up and maintaining the fertility of their farms. The\r\nmen who raise the largest crops and make the most money by farming, do\r\nnot sell clover-hay. They do not look to the roots of the clover for\r\nmaking a poor soil rich. They are, to a man, good cultivators. They work\r\ntheir land thoroughly and kill the weeds. They keep good stock, and feed\r\nliberally, and make good manure. They use lime, ashes, and plaster, and\r\nare glad to draw manure from the cities and villages, and muck from the\r\nswamps, and not a few of them buy artificial manures. In the hands of\r\nsuch farmers, clover is a grand renovating crop. It gathers up the\r\nfertility of the soil, and the roots alone of a large crop, often\r\nfurnish food enough for a good crop of corn, potatoes, or wheat. But if\r\nyour land was not in good heart to start with, you would not get the\r\nlarge crop of clover; and if you depend on the clover-roots alone, the\r\ntime is not far distant when your large crops of clover will be things\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF ROOTS LEFT IN THE SOIL BY DIFFERENT CROPS.\r\n\r\n“We have seen that Dr. Vœlcker made four separate determinations of the\r\namount of clover-roots left in the soil to the depth of six inches. It\r\nmay be well to tabulate the figures obtained:\r\n\r\n  Clover-Roots, in Six Inches of Soil, Per Acre.\r\n\r\n  ------+--------------------------------+---------+---------+----------\r\n        |                                |Air-dry  |Nitrogen |Phosphoric\r\n        |                                |roots,   |in roots,|acid in\r\n        |                                |per acre.|per acre.|roots,\r\n        |                                |         |         |per acre.\r\n  ------+--------------------------------+---------+---------+----------\r\n        |1st Year.                       |         |         |\r\n  No. 1.|  Good Clover from brow         |   7705  |   100   |\r\n        |      of the hill               |         |         |\r\n   ”  2.|  Bad    ”     ”    ”           |   3920  |    31   |\r\n        |       ”  ”   ”                 |         |         |\r\n        |                                |         |         |\r\n        |2d Year.                        |         |         |\r\n   ”  3.|  Good Clover from bottom       |   7569  |    61   |   27\r\n        |      of the field              |         |         |\r\n   ”  4.|  Thin   ”     ”   brow         |   8064  |    66   |\r\n        |      ”   ”   hill              |         |         |\r\n        |                                |         |         |\r\n   ”  5.|Heavy crop of first-year clover |         |         |\r\n        |  mown twice for hay            |         |    24½  |\r\n   ”  6.|Heavy crop of first-year clover |         |         |\r\n        |  mown once for hay,            |         |    51½  |\r\n        |  and then for seed             |         |         |\r\n   ”  7.|German experiment,              |         |         |\r\n        |  10¼ inches deep               |   8921  |   191½  |   74¾\r\n  ------+--------------------------------+---------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nI have not much confidence in experiments of this kind. It is so easy to\r\nmake a little mistake; and when you take only a square foot of land, as\r\nwas the case with Nos. 5 and 6, the mistake is multiplied by 43,560.\r\nStill, I give the table for what it is worth.\r\n\r\nNos. 1 and 2 are from a one-year-old crop of clover. The field was a\r\ncalcareous clay soil. It was somewhat hilly; or, perhaps, what we here,\r\nin Western New York, should call “rolling land.” The soil on the brow of\r\nthe hill, “was very stony at a depth of four inches, so that it could\r\nonly with difficulty be excavated to six inches, when the bare\r\nlimestone-rock made its appearance.”\r\n\r\nA square yard was selected on this shallow soil, where the clover was\r\ngood; and the roots, air-dried, weighed at the rate of 7,705 lbs. per\r\nacre, and contained 100 lbs. of nitrogen. A few yards distance, on the\r\nsame soil, where the clover was bad, the acre of roots contained only 31\r\nlbs. of nitrogen per acre.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. We can well understand this result. Chemistry has\r\nlittle to do with it. There was a good stand of clover on the one plot,\r\nand a poor one on the other. And the conclusion to be drawn from it is,\r\nthat it is well worth our while to try to secure a good catch of clover.\r\n\r\n“But, suppose,” said the Doctor, “No. 2 had happened to have been\r\npastured by sheep, and No. 1 allowed to go to seed, what magic there\r\nwould have been in the above figures!”\r\n\r\nNos. 3 and 4 are from the same field, the second year. No. 4 is from a\r\nsquare yard of thin clover on the brow of the hill, and No. 3, from the\r\nricher, deeper land towards the bottom of the hill.\r\n\r\nThere is very little difference between them. The roots of thin clover\r\nfrom the brow of the hill, contain five lbs. more nitrogen per acre,\r\nthan the roots on the deeper soil.\r\n\r\nIf we can depend on the figures, we may conclude that on our poor stony\r\n“knolls,” the clover has larger and longer roots than on the richer\r\nparts of the field. We know that roots will run long distances and great\r\ndepths in search of food and water.\r\n\r\nNos. 5 and 6 are from a heavy crop of one-year-old clover. No. 5 was\r\nmown twice for hay, producing, in the two cuttings, over four tons of\r\nhay per acre. No. 6 was in the same field, the only difference being\r\nthat the clover, instead of being cut the second time for hay, was\r\nallowed to stand a few weeks longer to ripen its seed. You will see that\r\nthe latter has more roots than the former.\r\n\r\nThere are 24½ lbs. of nitrogen per acre in the one case, and 51½ lbs. in\r\nthe other. How far this is due to difference in the condition of the\r\nland, or to the difficulties in the way of getting out all the roots\r\nfrom the square yard, is a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nTruth to tell, I have very little confidence in any of these figures. It\r\nwill be observed that I have put at the bottom of the table, the result\r\nof an examination made in Germany. In this case, the nitrogen in the\r\nroots of an acre of clover, amounted to 191½ lbs. per acre. If we can\r\ndepend on the figures, we must conclude that there were nearly eight\r\ntimes as much clover-roots per acre in the German field, as in the\r\nremarkably heavy crop of clover in the English field No. 5.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Deacon, “but the one was 10¼ inches deep, and the other\r\nonly six inches deep; and besides, the German experiment includes the\r\n‘stubble’ with the roots.”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon is right; and it will be well to give the complete table, as\r\npublished in the _American Agriculturist_:\r\n\r\n  Table Showing the Amount of Roots and Stubble Left Per Acre by\r\n  Different Crops, and the Amount of Ingredients Which They Contain\r\n  Per Acre.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+---------------+------------+---------------\r\n                           |No. of lbs. of |            |\r\n                           |stubble & roots|            |  No. of lbs.\r\n                           |(dry) per acre |No. of lbs. |  of ash, free\r\n                           |to a depth of  |of Nitrogen | from carbonic\r\n                           |10¼ inches.    | per acre.  |acid, per acre.\r\n  -------------------------+---------------+------------+---------------\r\n  Lucern (4 years old)     |   9,678.1     |   136.4    |   1,201.6\r\n  Red-Clover (1 year old,) |   8,921.6     |   191.6    |   1,919.9\r\n  Esparsette (3 years old) |   5,930.9     |   123.2    |   1,023.4\r\n  Rye                      |   5,264.6     |    65.3    |   1,747.8\r\n  Swedish Clover           |   5,004.3     |   102.3    |     974.6\r\n  Rape                     |   4,477.      |    56.5    |     622.3\r\n  Oats                     |   3,331.9     |    26.6    |   1,444.7\r\n  Lupine                   |   3,520.9     |    62.2    |     550.\r\n  Wheat                    |   3,476.      |    23.5    |   1,089.8\r\n  Peas                     |   3,222.5     |    55.6    |     670.7\r\n  Serradella               |   3,120.1     |    64.8    |     545.6\r\n  Buckwheat                |   2,195.6     |    47.9    |     465.5\r\n  Barley                   |   1,991.4     |    22.8    |     391.1\r\n  -------------------------+---------------+------------+---------------\r\n\r\n  Contents of the Ashes, in Pounds, Per Acre.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------+---------+-------+-------+---------+----------\r\n                 | Lime. |Magnesia.|Potash.| Soda. |Sulphuric|Phosphoric\r\n                 |       |         |       |       |  Acid.  |   Acid.\r\n  ---------------+-------+---------+-------+-------+---------+----------\r\n  Lucern         | 197.7 |   24.2  |  36.7 |  26.4 |   18.7  |   38.5\r\n  Red-Clover     | 262.9 |   48.4  |  58.3 |  20.0 |   26.1  |   74.8\r\n  Esparsette     | 132.8 |   28.7  |  42.6 |  13.8 |   20.6  |   29.7\r\n  Rye            |  73.2 |   14.3  |  31.2 |  43.3 |   11.8  |   24.4\r\n  Swedish Clover | 136.1 |   17.6  |  25.9 |   5.7 |   13.2  |   24.2\r\n  Rape           | 163.9 |   12.9  |  34.7 |  20.9 |   30.8  |   31.9\r\n  Oats           |  85.5 |   11.2  |  24.8 |  18.  |    8.8  |   29.\r\n  Lupine         |  80.5 |   11.2  |  16.5 |   3.5 |    7.   |   13.8\r\n  Wheat          |  76.7 |   10.1  |  28.4 |  11.  |    7.4  |   11.8\r\n  Peas           |  71.7 |   11.   |  11.2 |   7.  |    9.4  |   14.3\r\n  Serradella     |  79.8 |   13.4  |   8.8 |   4.8 |    9.   |   18.4\r\n  Buckwheat      |  80.  |    7.2  |   8.8 |   4.2 |    6.6  |   11.\r\n  Barley         |  42.2 |    5.5  |   9.5 |   3.5 |    5.5  |   11.2\r\n  ---------------+-------+---------+-------+-------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed, that, while these figures are not _absolutely_, they\r\nare _relatively_, correct. In other words, we may conclude, that\r\nred-clover leaves more nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, in the\r\nroots and stubble per acre, than any other of the crops named.\r\n\r\nThe gross amount of dry substance in the roots, and the gross amount of\r\nash per acre, are considerably exaggerated, owing to the evidently large\r\nquantity of dirt attached to the roots and stubble. For instance, the\r\ngross amount of ash in Lucern is given as 1,201.6 lbs. per acre; while\r\nthe total amount of lime, magnesia, potash, soda, sulphuric and\r\nphosphoric acids, is only 342.2 lbs. per acre, leaving 859.4 lbs. as\r\nsand, clay, iron, etc. Of the 1,919.9 lbs. of ash in the acre of\r\nclover-roots and stubble, there are 1,429.4 lbs. of sand, clay, etc. But\r\neven after deducting this amount of impurities from a gross total of dry\r\nmatter per acre, we still have 7,492.2 lbs. of dry roots and stubble per\r\nacre, or nearly 3¼ tons of _dry_ roots per acre. This is a very large\r\nquantity. It is as much dry matter as is contained in 13 tons of\r\nordinary farm-yard, or stable-manure. And these 3¼ tons of dry\r\nclover-roots contain 191½ lbs. of nitrogen, which is as much as is\r\ncontained in 19 tons of ordinary stable-manure. The clover-roots also\r\ncontain 74¾ lbs. of phosphoric acid per acre, or as much as is contained\r\nin from 500 to 600 lbs. of No. 1 rectified Peruvian guano.\r\n\r\n“But the phosphoric acid,” said the Doctor, “is not soluble in the\r\nroots.” True, but it was soluble when the roots gathered it up out of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n“These figures,” said the Deacon, “have a very pleasant look. Those of\r\nus who have nearly one-quarter of our land in clover every year, ought\r\nto be making our farms very rich.”\r\n\r\n“It would seem, at any rate,” said I, “that those of us who have good,\r\nclean, well-drained, and well-worked land, that is now producing a good\r\ngrowth of clover, may reasonably expect a fair crop of wheat, barley,\r\noats, corn, or potatoes, when we break it up and plow under all the\r\nroots, which are equal to 13 or 19 tons of stable-manure per acre.\r\nWhether we can or can not depend on these figures, one thing is clearly\r\nproven, both by the chemist and the farmer, that a good clover-sod, on\r\nwell-worked soil, is a good preparation for corn and potatoes.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR WHEAT.\r\n\r\nProbably nine-tenths of all the wheat grown in Western New York, or the\r\n“Genesee country,” from the time the land was first cleared until 1870,\r\nwas raised without any manure being directly applied to the land for\r\nthis crop. Tillage and clover were what the farmers depended on. There\r\ncertainly has been no systematic manuring. The manure made during the\r\nwinter, was drawn out in the spring, and plowed under for corn. Any\r\nmanure made during the summer, in the yards, was, by the best farmers,\r\nscraped up and spread on portions of the land sown, or to be sown, with\r\nwheat. Even so good a farmer and wheat-grower as John Johnston, rarely\r\nused manure, (except lime, and latterly, a little guano), directly for\r\nwheat. Clover and summer-fallowing were for many years the dependence of\r\nthe Western New York wheat-growers.\r\n\r\n“One of the oldest and most experienced millers of Western New York,”\r\nremarked the Doctor, “once told me that ‘ever since our farmers began to\r\n_manure their land_, the wheat-crop had deteriorated, not only in the\r\nyield per acre, but in the quality and quantity of the flour obtained\r\nfrom it.’ It seemed a strange remark to make; but when he explained that\r\nthe farmers had given up summer-fallowing and plowing in clover, and now\r\nsow spring crops, to be followed by winter wheat with an occasional\r\ndressing of poor manure, it is easy to see how it may be true.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “it is not the _manure_ that hurts the wheat, but the\r\ngrowth of spring crops and weeds that rob the soil of far more\r\nplant-food than the poor, strawy manure can supply. We do not now,\r\nreally, furnish the wheat-crop as much manure or plant-food as we\r\nformerly did when little or no manure was used, and when we depended on\r\nsummer-fallowing and plowing in clover.”\r\n\r\nWe must either give up the practice of sowing a spring crop, before\r\nwheat, or we must make more and richer manure, or we must plow in more\r\nclover. The rotation, which many of us now adopt--corn, barley,\r\nwheat--is profitable, provided we can make our land rich enough to\r\nproduce 75 bushels of shelled corn, 50 bushels of barley, and 35 bushels\r\nof wheat, per acre, in three years.\r\n\r\nThis can be done, but we shall either require a number of acres of rich\r\nlow land, or irrigated meadow, the produce of which will make manure for\r\nthe upland, or we shall have to purchase oil-cake, bran, malt-combs, or\r\nrefuse beans, to feed out with our straw and clover-hay, or we must\r\npurchase artificial manures. Unless this is done, we must summer-fallow\r\nmore, on the heavier clay soils, sow less oats and barley; or we must,\r\non the lighter soils, raise and plow under more clover, or feed it out\r\non the farm, being careful to save and apply the manure.\r\n\r\n“Better do both,” said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n“How?” asked the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“You had better make all the manure you can,” continued the Doctor, “and\r\nbuy artificial manures besides.”\r\n\r\n“The Doctor is right,” said I, “and in point of fact, our best farmers\r\nare doing this very thing. They are making more manure and buying more\r\nmanure than ever before; or, to state the matter correctly, they are\r\nbuying artificial manures; and these increase the crops, and the extra\r\nquantity of straw, corn, and clover, so obtained, enables them to make\r\nmore manure. They get cheated sometimes in their purchases; but, on the\r\nwhole, the movement is a good one, and will result in a higher and\r\nbetter system of farming.”\r\n\r\nI am amused at the interest and enthusiasm manifested by some of our\r\nfarmers who have used artificial manures for a year or two. They seem to\r\nregard me as a sad old fogy, because I am now depending almost entirely\r\non the manures made on the farm. Years ago, I was laughed at because I\r\nused guano and superphosphate. It was only yesterday, that a young\r\nfarmer, who is the local agent of this neighborhood, for a manure\r\nmanufacturer, remarked to me, “You have never used superphosphate. We\r\nsowed it on our wheat last year, and could see to the very drill mark\r\nhow far it went. I would like to take your order for a ton. I am sure it\r\nwould pay.”\r\n\r\n“We are making manure cheaper than you can sell it to me,” I replied,\r\n“and besides, I do not think superphosphate is a good manure for\r\nwheat.” --“Oh,” he exclaimed, “you would not say so if you had ever used\r\nit.” --“Why, my dear sir,” said I, “I made tons of superphosphate, and\r\nused large quantities of guano before you were born; and if you will\r\ncome into the house, I will show you a silver goblet I got for a prize\r\nessay on the use of superphosphate of lime, that I wrote more than a\r\nquarter of a century ago. I sent to New York for two tons of guano, and\r\npublished the result of its use on this farm, before you were out of\r\nyour cradle. And I had a ton or more of superphosphate made for me in\r\n1856, and some before that. I have also used on this farm, many tons of\r\nsuperphosphate and other artificial manures from different\r\nmanufacturers, and one year I used 15 tons of bone-dust.”\r\n\r\nWith ready tact, he turned the tables on me by saying: “Now I can\r\nunderstand why your land is improving. It is because you have used\r\nsuperphosphate and bone-dust. Order a few tons.”\r\n\r\nBy employing agents of this kind, the manufacturers have succeeded in\r\nselling the farmers of Western New York thousands of tons of\r\nsuperphosphate. Some farmers think it pays, and some that it does not.\r\nWe are more likely to hear of the successes than of failures. Still\r\nthere can be no doubt that superphosphate has, in many instances, proved\r\na valuable and profitable manure for wheat in Western New York.\r\n\r\nFrom 200 to 300 lbs. are used per acre, and the evidence seems to show\r\nthat it is far better to _drill in the manure with the seed_ than to sow\r\nit broadcast.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy own opinion is, that these superphosphates are not the most\r\neconomical artificial manures that could be used for wheat. They contain\r\ntoo little nitrogen. Peruvian guano containing nitrogen equal to 10 per\r\ncent of ammonia, would be, I think, a much more effective and profitable\r\nmanure. But before we discuss this question, it will be necessary to\r\nstudy the results of actual experiments in the use of various\r\nfertilizers for wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nLAWES AND GILBERT’S EXPERIMENTS ON WHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hardly know how to commence an account of the wonderful experiments\r\nmade at Rothamsted, England, by John Bennett Lawes, Esq., and Dr. Joseph\r\nH. Gilbert. Mr. Lawes’ first systematic experiment on wheat, commenced\r\nin the autumn of 1843. A field of 14 acres of rather heavy clay soil,\r\nresting on chalk, was selected for the purpose. Nineteen plots were\r\naccurately measured and staked off. The plots ran the long way of the\r\nfield, and up a slight ascent. On each side of the field, alongside the\r\nplots, there was some land not included, the first year, in the\r\nexperiment proper. This land was either left without manure, or a\r\nmixture of the manures used in the experiments was sown on it.\r\n\r\nI have heard it said that Mr. Lawes, at this time, was a believer in\r\nwhat was called “Liebig’s Mineral Manure Theory.” Liebig had said that\r\n“The crops on a field, diminish or increase in exact proportion to the\r\ndiminution or increase of the mineral substances conveyed to it in\r\nmanure.” And enthusiastic gentlemen have been known to tell farmers who\r\nwere engaged in drawing out farm-yard manure to their land, that they\r\nwere wasting their strength; all they needed was the mineral elements of\r\nthe manure. “And you might,” they said, “burn your manure, and sow the\r\nashes, and thus save much time and labor. The ashes will do just as much\r\ngood as the manure itself.”\r\n\r\nWhether Mr. Lawes did, or did not entertain such an opinion, I do not\r\nknow. It looks as though the experiments the first year or two, were\r\nmade with the expectation that mineral manures, or the ashes of plants,\r\nwere what the wheat needed.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the kind and quantities of manures used per\r\nacre, and the yield of wheat per acre, as carefully cleaned for market.\r\nAlso the total weight of grain per acre, and the weight of straw and\r\nchaff per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Experiments at Rothamsted on the Growth of Wheat, Year After Year,\r\n  on the Same Land.\r\n\r\n  Table 1.--Manures And Produce; 1st Season, 1843-4.

The product was a\r\n  transparent glass, slightly deliquescent in the air, which was ground\r\n  to a powder under edge-stones.]\r\n\r\n  [Note 3: The manures termed superphosphate of lime, phosphate of\r\n  potass, phosphate of soda, and phosphate of magnesia, were made by\r\n  acting upon bone-ash by means of sulphuric acid in the first instance,\r\n  and in the case-of the alkali salts and the magnesian one neutralizing\r\n  the compound thus obtained by means of cheap preparations of the\r\n  respective bases. For the superphosphate of lime, the proportions were\r\n  5 parts bone-ash, 3 parts water, and 3 parts sulphuric acid of sp. gr.\r\n  1.84; and for the phosphates of potass, soda, and magnesia, they were\r\n  4 parts bone-ash, water as needed, 3 parts sulphuric acid of sp. gr.\r\n  1.84, and equivalent amounts, respectively, of pearl-ash, soda-ash, or\r\n  a mixture of 1 part medicinal carbonate of magnesia, and 4 parts\r\n  magnesian limestone.

To bring the records more in conformity\r\n  with those relating to the other years, 5 per cent, by weight, has\r\n  been deducted from the total corn previously stated as dressed corn,\r\n  and is recorded as offal corn; this being about the probable\r\n  proportion, judging from the character of the season, the bulk of\r\n  the crop, and the weight per bushel of the dressed corn. Although not\r\n  strictly correct, the statements of dressed corn, as amended in this\r\n  somewhat arbitrary way, will approximate more nearly to the truth, and\r\n  be more comparable with those relating to other seasons, than those\r\n  hitherto recorded.]\r\n\r\nThese were the results of the harvest of 1844. The first year of these\r\nsince celebrated experiments.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Lawes expected that the crops would be in proportion to the\r\nminerals supplied in the manure, he must have been greatly disappointed.\r\nThe plot without manure of any kind, gave 15 bushels of wheat per acre;\r\n700 lbs. of superphosphate of lime, made from burnt bones, produced only\r\n38 lbs. or about half a bushel more grain per acre, and 4 lbs. _less_\r\nstraw than was obtained without manure. 640 lbs. of superphosphate, and\r\n65 lbs. of commercial sulphate of ammonia (equal to about 14 lbs. of\r\nammonia), gave a little over 19½ bushels of dressed wheat per acre. As\r\ncompared with the plot having 700 lbs. of superphosphate per acre, this\r\n14 lbs. of available ammonia per acre, or, say 11½ lbs. nitrogen, gave\r\nan increase of 324 lbs. of grain, and 252 lbs. of straw, or a total\r\nincrease of 576 lbs. of grain and straw.\r\n\r\nOn plot No. 19, 81 lbs. of sulphate ammonia, with minerals, produces 24¼\r\nbushels per acre. This yield is clearly due to the ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe rape-cake contains about 5 per cent of nitrogen, and is also rich in\r\nminerals and _carbonaceous matter_. It gives an increase, but not as\r\nlarge in proportion to the nitrogen furnished, as the sulphate of\r\nammonia. And the same remarks apply to the 14 tons of farm-yard manure.\r\n\r\nWe should have expected a greater increase from such a liberal dressing\r\nof barn-yard manure. I think the explanation is this: The manure had not\r\nbeen piled. It was probably taken out fresh from the yard (this, at any\r\nrate, was the case when I was at Rothamsted), and plowed under late in\r\nthe season. And on this heavy land, manure will lie buried in the soil\r\nfor months, or, if undisturbed, for years, without decomposition. In\r\nother words, while this 14 tons of barn-yard manure, contained at least\r\n150 lbs. of nitrogen, and a large quantity of minerals and carbonaceous\r\nmatter, it did not produce a bushel per acre more than a manure\r\ncontaining less than 12 lbs. of nitrogen. And on plot 19, a manure\r\ncontaining less than 15 lbs. of available nitrogen, produced nearly 4\r\nbushels per acre more wheat than the barn-yard manure containing at\r\nleast _ten times_ as much nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThere can be but one explanation of this fact. The nitrogen in the\r\nmanure lay dormant in this heavy soil. Had it been a light sandy soil,\r\nit would have decomposed more rapidly and produced a better effect.\r\n\r\nAs we have before stated, John Johnston finds, on his clay-land, a far\r\ngreater effect from manure spread on the surface, where it decomposes\r\nrapidly, than when the manure is plowed under.\r\n\r\nThe Deacon was looking at the figures in the table, and not paying much\r\nattention to our talk. “What could a man be thinking about,” he said,\r\n“to burn 14 tons of good manure! It was a great waste, and I am glad the\r\nashes did no sort of good.”\r\n\r\nAfter the wheat was harvested in 1844, the land was immediately plowed,\r\nharrowed, etc.; and in a few weeks was plowed again and sown to wheat,\r\nthe different plots being kept separate, as before.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the manures used this second year, and the\r\nyield per acre:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Experiments at Rothamsted on the Growth of Wheat, Year After Year,\r\n  on The Same Land.\r\n\r\n  Table II.--Manures and Produce; 2nd Season, 1845.

On plot No. 3, which had no\r\nmanure last year, or this, the yield is 23 bushels per acre, against 15\r\nbushels last year.\r\n\r\nLast year, the 14 tons of barn-yard manure gave an _increase_ of only 5¼\r\nbushels per acre. This year it gives an increase of nearly 9 bushels per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean,” said the Deacon, “that this plot, No. 2, had 14 tons of\r\nmanure in 1844, and 14 tons of manure again in 1845?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely that, Deacon,” said I, “and this same plot has received this\r\namount of manure every year since, up to the present time--for these\r\nsame experiments are still continued from year to year at Rothamsted.”\r\n\r\n“It is poor farming,” said the Deacon, “and I should think the land\r\nwould get too rich to grow wheat.”\r\n\r\n“It is not so,” said I, “and the fact is an interesting one, and teaches\r\na most important lesson, of which, more hereafter.”\r\n\r\nPlot 5, last year, received 700 lbs. of superphosphate per acre. This\r\nyear, this plot was divided; one half was left without manure, and the\r\nother dressed with 252 lbs. of pure carbonate of ammonia per acre. The\r\nhalf without manure, (5a), did not produce quite as much grain and straw\r\nas the plot which had received no manure for two years in succession.\r\nBut the wheat was of better quality, weighing 1 lb. more per bushel than\r\nthe other. Still it is sufficiently evident that superphosphate of lime\r\ndid no good so far as increasing the growth was concerned, either the\r\nfirst year it was applied, or the year following.\r\n\r\nThe carbonate of ammonia was dissolved in water and sprinkled over the\r\ngrowing wheat at three different times during the spring. You see this\r\nmanure, which contains no _mineral_ matter at all, gives an increase of\r\nnearly 4 bushels of grain per acre, and an increase of 887 lbs. of\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment,” said the Deacon, “is not 887 lbs. of straw to 4 bushels\r\nof grain an unusually large proportion of straw to grain? I have heard\r\nyou say that 100 lbs. of straw to each bushel of wheat is about the\r\naverage. And according to this experiment, the carbonate of ammonia\r\nproduced over 200 lbs. of straw to a bushel of grain. How do you account\r\nfor this.”\r\n\r\n“It is a general rule,” said I, “that the heavier the crop, the greater\r\nis the proportion of straw to grain. On the no-manure plot, we have,\r\nthis year, 118 lbs. of straw to a bushel of dressed grain. Taking this\r\nas the standard, you will find that the _increase_ from manures is\r\nproportionally greater in straw than in grain. Thus in the increase of\r\nbarn-yard manure, this year, we have about 133 lbs. of straw to a bushel\r\nof grain. I do not believe there is any manure that will give us a large\r\ncrop of grain without a still larger crop of straw. There is\r\nconsiderable difference, in this respect, between different varieties of\r\nwheat. Still, I like to see a good growth of straw.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is curious,” said the Doctor, “that 3 cwt. of ammonia-salts alone on\r\nplots 9 and 10 should produce as much wheat as was obtained from plot 2,\r\nwhere 14 tons of barn-yard manure had been applied two years in\r\nsuccession. I notice that on one plot, the ammonia-salts were applied at\r\nonce, in the spring, while on the other plot they were sown at four\r\ndifferent times--and that the former gave the best results.”\r\n\r\nThe only conclusion to be drawn from this, is, that it is desirable to\r\napply the manure _early_ in the spring--or better still, in the autumn.\r\n\r\n“You are a great advocate of Peruvian guano,” said the Deacon, “and yet\r\n3 cwt. of Peruvian guano on Plot 13, only produced an increase of two\r\nbushels and 643 lbs. of straw per acre. The guano at $60 per ton, would\r\ncost $9.00 per acre. This will not pay.”\r\n\r\nThis is an unusually small increase. The reason, probably, is to be\r\nfound in the fact that the manure and seed were not sown until March,\r\ninstead of in the autumn. The salts of ammonia are quite soluble and act\r\nquickly; while the Peruvian guano has to decompose in the soil, and\r\nconsequently needs to be applied earlier, especially on clay land.\r\n\r\n“I do not want you,” said the Deacon, “to dodge the question why an\r\napplication of 14 tons of farmyard-manure per acre, every year for over\r\nthirty years, does not make the land too rich for wheat.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly,” said I, “on light, sandy soil, such an annual dressing of\r\nmanure _would_ in the course of a few years make the land too rich for\r\nwheat. But on a clayey soil, such is evidently not the case. And the\r\nfact is a very important one. When we apply manure, our object should be\r\nto make it as available as possible. Nature preserves or conserves the\r\nfood of plants. The object of agriculture is to use the food of plants\r\nfor our own advantage.”\r\n\r\n“Please be a little more definite,” said the Deacon, “for I must confess\r\nI do not quite see the significance of your remarks.”\r\n\r\n“What he means,” said the Doctor, “is this: If you put a quantity of\r\nsoluble and available manure on land, and do not sow any crop, the\r\nmanure will not be wasted. The soil will retain it. It will change it\r\nfrom a soluble into a comparatively insoluble form. Had a crop been sown\r\nthe first year, the manure would do far more good than it will the next\r\nyear, and yet it may be that none of the manure is lost. It is merely\r\nlocked up in the soil in such a form as will prevent it from running to\r\nwaste. If it was not for this principle, our lands would have been long\r\nago exhausted of all their available plant-food.”\r\n\r\n“I think I understand,” said the Deacon; “but if what you say is true,\r\nit upsets many of our old notions. We have thought it desirable to plow\r\nunder manure, in order to prevent the ammonia from escaping. You claim,\r\nI believe, that there is little danger of any loss from spreading manure\r\non the surface, and I suppose you would have us conclude that we make a\r\nmistake in plowing it under, as the soil renders it insoluble.”\r\n\r\n“It depends a good deal,” said I, “on the character of the soil.\r\nA light, sandy soil will not preserve manure like a clay soil. But it is\r\nundoubtedly true that our aim in all cases should be to apply manure in\r\nsuch a form and to such a crop as will give us the greatest _immediate_\r\nbenefit. Plowing under fresh manure every year for wheat is evidently\r\nnot the best way to get the greatest benefit from it. But this is not\r\nthe place to discuss this matter.

And I want the\r\nDeacon to look at plot 0. 3 cwt. of Peruvian guano here gives an\r\nincrease of 10½ bushels of wheat, and 1,948 lbs. of straw per acre. This\r\nwill pay _well_, even on the wheat alone. But in addition to this, we\r\nmay expect, in our ordinary rotation of crops, a far better crop of\r\nclover where the guano was used.\r\n\r\nIn regard to some of the results this year, Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert\r\nhave the following concise and interesting remarks:\r\n\r\n“At this third experimental harvest, we have on the continuously\r\nunmanured plot, namely, No. 3, not quite 18 bushels of dressed corn, as\r\nthe normal produce of the season; and by its side we have on plot\r\n10_b_--comprising one-half of the plot 10 of the previous years, and so\r\nhighly manured by ammoniacal salts in 1845, but now unmanured--rather\r\nmore than 17½ bushels. The near approach, again, to identity of result\r\nfrom the two unmanured plots, at once gives confidence in the accuracy\r\nof the experiments, and shows us how effectually the preceding crop had,\r\nin a practical point of view, reduced the plots, previously so\r\ndifferently circumstanced both as to manure and produce, to something\r\nlike an uniform standard as regards their grain-producing qualities.\r\n\r\n“Plot 2 has, as before, 14 tons of farm-yard manure, and the produce is\r\n27¼ bushels, or between 9 and 10 bushels more than without manure of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n“On plot 10_a_, which in the previous year gave by ammoniacal salts\r\nalone, a produce equal to that of the farm-yard manure, we have again a\r\nsimilar result: for two cwts. of sulphate of ammonia has now given 1,850\r\nlbs. of total corn, instead of 1,826 lbs., which is the produce on plot\r\n2. The straw of the latter, is, however, slightly heavier than that by\r\nthe ammoniacal salt.\r\n\r\n“Again, plot 5_a_, which was in the previous season _unmanured_, was\r\nnow subdivided: on one-half of it (namely, 5_a_1) we have the ashes of\r\nwheat-straw alone, by which there is an increase of rather more than one\r\nbushel per acre of dressed corn; on the other half (or 5_a_2) we have,\r\nbesides the straw-ashes, two cwts. of sulphate of ammonia put on as a\r\ntop-dressing: two cwts. of sulphate of ammonia have, in this case, only\r\nincreased the produce beyond that of 5_a_1 by 7⅞ bushels of corn and\r\n768 lbs. of straw, instead of by 9¾ bushels of corn and 789 lbs. of\r\nstraw, which was the increase obtained by the same amount of ammoniacal\r\nsalt on 10_a_, as compared with 10_b_.\r\n\r\n“It will be observed, however, that in the former case the ammoniacal\r\nsalts were top-dressed, but in the latter they were drilled at the time\r\nof sowing the seed; and it will be remembered that in 1845 the result\r\nwas better _as to corn_ on plot 9, where the salts were sown earlier,\r\nthan on plot 10, where the top-dressing extended far into the spring. We\r\nhave had several direct instances of this kind in our experience, and we\r\nwould give it as a suggestion, in most cases applicable, that manures\r\nfor wheat, and especially ammoniacal ones, should be applied before or\r\nat the time the seed is sown; for, although the apparent luxuriance of\r\nthe crop is greater, and the produce of straw really heavier, by spring\r\nrather than autumn sowings of Peruvian guano and other ammoniacal\r\nmanures, yet we believe that that of the _corn_ will not be increased in\r\nan equivalent degree. Indeed, the success of the crop undoubtedly\r\ndepends very materially on the progress of the underground growth during\r\nthe winter months; and this again, other things being equal, upon the\r\nquantity of available nitrogenous constituents within the soil, without\r\na liberal provision of which, the range of the fibrous feeders of the\r\nplant will not be such, as to take up the minerals which the soil is\r\ncompetent to supply, and in such quantity as will be required during the\r\nafter progress of the plant for its healthy and favorable growth.”\r\n\r\nThese remarks are very suggestive and deserve special attention.\r\n\r\n“The next result to be noticed,” continue Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert, “is\r\nthat obtained on plot 6, now also divided into two equal portions\r\ndesignated respectively 6_a_ and 6_b_. Plot No. 6 had for the crop of\r\n1844, superphosphate of lime and the phosphate of magnesia manure, and\r\nfor that of 1845, superphosphate of lime, rape-cake, and ammoniacal\r\nsalts. For this, the third season, it was devoted to the trial of the\r\nwheat-manure manufactured under the sanction of Professor Liebig, and\r\npatented in this country.\r\n\r\n“Upon plots 6_a_, four cwts. per acre of the patent wheat-manure were\r\nused, which gave 20¼ bushels, or rather more than two bushels beyond the\r\nproduce of the unmanured plot; but as the manure contained, besides the\r\nminerals peculiar to it, some nitrogenous compounds, giving off a very\r\nperceptible odor of ammonia, some, at least, of the increase would be\r\ndue to that substance. On plot 6_b_, however, the further addition of\r\none cwt. each of sulphate and muriate of ammonia to this so-called\r\n‘Mineral Manure,’ gives a produce of 29¼ bushels. In other words, the\r\naddition of ammoniacal salt, to Liebig’s mineral manure has increased\r\nthe produce by very nearly 9 bushels per acre beyond that of the mineral\r\nmanure alone, whilst the increase obtained over the unmanured plot, by\r\n14 tons of farm-yard manure, was only 9¼ bushels!\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the results of the experiments the _fourth_\r\nyear, 1846-7.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Experiments at Rothamsted on the Growth of Wheat, Year After Year,\r\n  on the Same Land.\r\n\r\n  Table IV.--Manures and Produce; 4th Season, 1846-7.

Peruvian\r\nguano, sown in October, gives an _increase_ of nearly 14 bushels of\r\ndressed wheat and 1,375 lbs. of straw per acre. On plot 2, where 14 tons\r\nof barn-yard manure have now been applied four years in succession (56\r\ntons in all), there is a little more straw, but not quite so much grain,\r\nas from the 500 lbs. of guano.\r\n\r\n“But will the guano,” said the Deacon, “be as lasting as the manure?”\r\n\r\n“Not for wheat,” said I. “But if you seed the wheat down with clover, as\r\nwould be the case in this section, we should get considerable benefit,\r\nprobably, from the guano. If wheat was sown after the wheat, the guano\r\napplied the previous season would do little good on the second crop of\r\nwheat. And yet it is a matter of fact that there would be a considerable\r\nproportion of the guano left in the soil. The wheat cannot take it up.\r\nBut the clover can. And we all know that if we can grow good crops of\r\nclover, plowing it under, or feeding it out on the land, or making it\r\ninto hay and saving the manure obtained from it, we shall thus be\r\nenabled to raise good crops of wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and corn,\r\nand in this sense guano is a ‘lasting’ manure.”\r\n\r\n“Barnyard-manure,” said the Doctor, “is altogether too ‘lasting.’ Here\r\nwe have had 56 tons of manure on an acre of land in four years, and yet\r\nan acre dressed with 500 lbs. of guano produces just as good a crop. The\r\nmanure contains far more plant-food, of all kinds, than the guano, but\r\nit is so ‘lasting’ that it does not do half as much good as its\r\ncomposition would lead us to expect. Its ‘lasting’ properties are a\r\ndecided objection, rather than an advantage. If we could make it less\r\nlasting--in other words, if we could make it act quicker, it would\r\nproduce a greater effect, and possess a greater value. In proportion to\r\nits constituents, the barn-yard manure is far cheaper than the guano,\r\nbut it has a less beneficial effect, because these constituents are not\r\nmore completely decomposed and rendered available.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said I, “opens up a very important question. We have more real\r\nvalue in manure than most of us are as yet able to bring out and turn to\r\ngood account. The sandy-land farmer has an advantage over the clay-land\r\nfarmer in this respect. The latter has a naturally richer soil, but it\r\ncosts him more to work it, and manure does not act so rapidly. The\r\nclay-land farmer should use his best endeavors to decompose his manure.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Doctor, “and, like John Johnston, he will probably find\r\nit to his advantage to use it largely as a top-dressing on the surface.\r\nExposing manure to the atmosphere, spread out on the land for several\r\nmonths, and harrowing it occasionally, will do much to render its\r\nconstituents available. But let us return to Mr. Lawes’ wonderful\r\nexperiments.”\r\n\r\n“On eight plots,” said I, “300 lbs. of ammonia-salts were used without\r\nany other manures, and the _average_ yield on these eight plots was\r\nnearly 26 bushels per acre, or an average increase of 9 bushels per\r\nacre. The same amount of ammonia-salts, with the addition of\r\nsuperphosphate of lime, gave an increase of 13 bushels per acre. 400\r\nlbs. ammonia salts, with superphosphate of lime, gave an _increase_ of\r\nnearly 16 bushels per acre, or three bushels per acre more than where 14\r\ntons of barn-yard manure had been used four years in succession.\r\n\r\n“I hope, after this, the Deacon will forgive me for dwelling on the\r\nvalue of available nitrogen or ammonia as a manure for wheat.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the Deacon, “that ground _rice_ was used this year for\r\nmanure; and in 1845, _tapioca_ was also used as a manure. The\r\nConnecticut Tobacco growers a few years since used _corn-meal_ for\r\nmanure, and you thought it a great waste of good food.”\r\n\r\nI think so still. But we will not discuss the matter now. Mr. Lawes\r\nwanted to ascertain whether _carbonaceous_ matter was needed by the\r\ngrowing wheat-plants, or whether they could get all they needed from the\r\nsoil and the atmosphere. The enormous quantities of carbonaceous matter\r\nsupplied by the barn-yard manure, it is quite evident, are of little\r\nvalue as a manure for wheat. And the rice seems to have done very little\r\nmore good than we should expect from the 22 lbs. of nitrogen which it\r\ncontained. The large quantity of carbonaceous matter evidently did\r\nlittle good. Available carbonaceous matter, such as starch, sugar, and\r\noil, was intended as food for man and beast--not as food for wheat or\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the results of the experiments the _fifth_\r\nyear, 1847-8.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Experiments at Rothamsted on the Growth of Wheat, Year After Year,\r\n  on the Same Land.\r\n\r\n  Table V.--Manures and Produce; 5th Season, 1847-8.

The continuously\r\nunmanured plot produced 14¾ bushels, and the plot receiving 14 tons of\r\nbarn yard manure, 25¾ bushels per acre nearly.\r\n\r\n300 lbs. of ammonia-salts alone on plot 10_a_, gave 19¼ bushels per\r\nacre, while the same quantity of ammonia, with superphosphate in\r\naddition, gave, on plot 9_b_, 25 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nThe addition to the above manures of 300 lbs. of potash, 200 lbs. soda,\r\nand 100 lbs. sulphate of magnesia, on plot 10_b_, gave precisely the\r\nsame yield per acre as the ammonia and the superphosphate alone. _The\r\npotash, soda, and magnesia, therefore, did no good._\r\n\r\n400 lbs. of ammonia-salts, with superphosphate, potash, etc., gave, on\r\nplot 17_b_, nearly 29 bushels per acre, or 3½ bushels more than the plot\r\nwhich has now received 70 tons of barn-yard manure in five successive\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n“I see that, on plot 0,” said the Deacon, “one ton of superphosphate was\r\nused per acre, and it gave only half a bushel per acre more than 350\r\nlbs. on 9_a_.”\r\n\r\n“This proves,” said I, “that an excessive dose of superphosphate will do\r\nno harm. I am not sure that 100 lbs. of a good superphosphate _drilled\r\nin with the seed_, would not have done _as much good_ as a ton per\r\nacre.”\r\n\r\n“You say,” remarked the Deacon, “that the season was unfavorable for\r\nwheat. And yet the no-manure plot produced nearly 15 bushels of wheat\r\nper acre.”\r\n\r\n“That is all true,” said I, “and yet the season was undoubtedly an\r\nunfavorable one. This is shown not only in the less yield, but in the\r\ninferior quality of the grain. The ‘dressed corn’ on the no-manure plot\r\nthis year only weighed 57⅓ lbs. per bushel, while last year it weighed\r\n61 lbs. per bushel.”\r\n\r\n“By the way,” said the Doctor, “what do Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert mean\r\nby ‘dressed corn’?”\r\n\r\n“By ‘corn,’” said I, “they mean wheat; and by ‘dressed corn’ they mean\r\nwheat that has been run through a fanning-mill until all the light and\r\nshrunken grain is blown or sieved out. In other words, ‘dressed corn’ is\r\nwheat carefully cleaned for market. The English farmers take more pains\r\nin cleaning their grain than we do. And this ‘dressed corn’ was as clean\r\nas a good fanning-mill could make it. You will observe that there was\r\nmore ‘offal corn’ this year than last. This also indicates an\r\nunfavorable season.”\r\n\r\n“It would have been very interesting,” said the Doctor, “if Messrs.\r\nLawes and Gilbert had analyzed the wheat produced by the different\r\nmanures, so that we might have known something in regard to the quality\r\nof the flour as influenced by the use of different fertilizers.”\r\n\r\n“They did that very thing,” said I, “and not only that, but they made\r\nthe wheat grown on different plots, into flour, and ascertained the\r\nyield of flour from a given weight of wheat, and the amount of bran,\r\nmiddlings, etc., etc. They obtained some very interesting and important\r\nresults. I was there at the time. But this is not the place to discuss\r\nthe question. I am often amused, however, at the remarks we often hear\r\nin regard to the inferior quality of our wheat as compared to what it\r\nwas when the country was new. Many seem to think that ‘there is\r\nsomething lacking in the soil’--some say potash, and some phosphates,\r\nand some this, and some that. I believe nothing of the kind. Depend upon\r\nit, the variety of the wheat and the soil and season have much more to\r\ndo with the quality or strength of the flour, than the chemical\r\ncomposition of the manures applied to the land.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said the Doctor, “we may be satisfied that anything that\r\nwill produce a vigorous, healthy growth of wheat is favorable to\r\nquality. We may use manures in excess, and thus produce over-luxuriance\r\nand an unhealthy growth, and have poor, shrunken grain. In this case, it\r\nis not the use, but the abuse of the manure that does the mischief. We\r\nmust not manure higher than the season will bear. As yet, this question\r\nrarely troubles us. Hitherto, as a rule, our seasons are better than our\r\nfarming. It may not always be so. We may find the liberal use of manure\r\nso profitable that we shall occasionally use it in excess. At present,\r\nhowever, the tendency is all the other way. We have more grain of\r\ninferior quality from lack of fertility than from an excess of\r\nplant-food.”\r\n\r\n“That may be true,” said I, “but we have more poor, inferior wheat from\r\nlack of draining and good culture, than from lack of plant-food.\r\nRed-root, thistles, cockle, and chess, have done more to injure the\r\nreputation of ‘Genesee Flour,’ than any other one thing, and I should\r\nlike to hear more said about thorough cultivation, and the destruction\r\nof weeds, and less about soil exhaustion.”\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the results of the experiments the _sixth\r\nyear_, 1848-9.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Experiments at Rothamsted on the Growth of Wheat, Year After Year,\r\n  on the Same Land.\r\n\r\n  Table VI.--Manures and Produce; 6th Season, 1848-9.

--------+-----+----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+----+----+----\r\n\r\n“This was my last year at Rothamsted,” said I, “and I feel a peculiar\r\ninterest in looking over the results after such a lapse of time. When\r\nthis crop was growing, my father, a good practical farmer, but with\r\nlittle faith in chemical manures, paid me a visit. We went to the\r\nexperimental wheat-field. The first two plots, 0 and 1, had been\r\ndressed, the one with superphosphate, the other with potash, soda, and\r\nmagnesia. My father did not seem much impressed with this kind of\r\nchemical manuring. Stepping to the next plot, where 14 tons of barn-yard\r\nmanure had been used, he remarked, “this is good, what have you here?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said I, “we have better crops farther on.”\r\n\r\nThe next plot, No. 3, was the one continuously unmanured. “I can beat\r\nthis myself,” said he, and passed on to the next. “This is better,” said\r\nhe, “what have you here?”\r\n\r\n“Superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is a good crop, and the straw is bright and stiff.”--It turned\r\nout 30 bushels per acre, 63 lbs. to the bushel.\r\n\r\nThe next six plots had received very heavy dressings of ammonia-salts,\r\nwith superphosphate, potash, soda, and magnesia. He examined them with\r\nthe greatest interest. “What have you here?” he asked, while he was\r\nexamining 5_a_, which afterwards turned out 37¼ bushels per\r\nacre. --“Potash, soda, epsom-salts, superphosphate, and ammonia--but it\r\nis the ammonia that does the good.”\r\n\r\nHe passed to the next plot, and was very enthusiastic over it. “What\r\nhave you here?” --“Rape-cake and ammonia,” said I. --“It is a grand\r\ncrop,” said he, and after examining it with great interest, he passed to\r\nthe next, 6_a_. --“What have you here?” --“Ammonia,” said I; and at 6_b_\r\nhe asked the same question, and I replied “ammonia.” At 7_a_, the same\r\nquestion and the same answer. Standing between 7_b_ and 8_a_, he was of\r\ncourse struck with the difference in the crop; 8_a_ was left this year\r\nwithout any manure, and though it had received a liberal supply of\r\nmineral manures the year before, and minerals and ammonia-salts, and\r\nrape-cake, the year previous, it only produced this year, 3½ bushels\r\nmore than the plot continuously unmanured. The contrast between the\r\nwheat on this plot and the next one might well interest a practical\r\nfarmer. There was over 15 bushels per acre more wheat on the one plot\r\nthan on the other, and 1,581 lbs. more straw.\r\n\r\nPassing to the next plot, he exclaimed “this is better, but not so\r\ngood as some that we have passed.” --“It has had a heavy dressing of\r\nrape-cake,” said I, “equal to about 100 lbs. of ammonia per acre, and\r\nthe next plot was manured this year in the same way. The only difference\r\nbeing that one had superphosphate and potash, soda, and magnesia, the\r\nyear before, while the other had superphosphate alone.” It turned out,\r\nas you see from the table, that the potash, etc., only gave half a\r\nbushel more wheat per acre the year it was used, and this year, with\r\n2,000 lbs. of rape-cake on each plot, there is only a bushel per acre in\r\nfavor of the potash, soda, and magnesia.\r\n\r\nThe next plot, 9_b_, was also unmanured and was passed by my father\r\nwithout comment. “Ah,” said he, on coming to the two next plots, 10_a_\r\nand 10_b_, “this is better, what have you here?” --“_Nothing but\r\nammonia_,” said I, “and I wish you would tell me which is the best of\r\nthe two? Last year 10_b_ had a heavy dressing of minerals and\r\nsuperphosphate with ammonia, and 10_a_ the same quantity of ammonia\r\nalone, without superphosphate or other mineral manures. And this year\r\nboth plots have had a dressing of 400 lbs. each of ammonia-salts. Now,\r\nwhich is the best--the plot that had superphosphate and minerals last\r\nyear, or the one without?” --“Well,” said he, “I can’t see any\r\ndifference. Both are good crops.”\r\n\r\nYou will see from the table, that the plot which had the superphosphate,\r\npotash, etc., the year before, gives a peck _less_ wheat this year than\r\nthe other plot which had none. Practically, the yield is the same. There\r\nis an increase of 13 bushels of wheat per acre--and this increase _is\r\nclearly due to the ammonia-salts alone_.\r\n\r\nThe next plot was also a splendid crop.\r\n\r\n“What have you here?”\r\n\r\n“Superphosphate and ammonia.”\r\n\r\nThis plot (11_a_), turned out 35 bushels per acre. The next plot, with\r\nphosphates and ammonia, was nearly as good. The next plot, with potash,\r\nphosphates, and ammonia, equally good, but no better than 11_a_. There\r\nwas little or no benefit from the potash, except a little more _straw_.\r\nThe next plot was good and I did not wait for the question, but simply\r\nsaid, “ammonia,” and the next “ammonia,” and the next “ammonia.”\r\n--Standing still and looking at the wheat, my father asked, “Joe, where\r\ncan I get this ammonia?” He had previously been a little skeptical as to\r\nthe value of chemistry, and had not a high opinion of “book farmers,”\r\nbut that wheat-crop compelled him to admit “that perhaps, after all,\r\nthere might be some good in it.” At any rate, he wanted to know where\r\nhe could get ammonia. And, now, as then, every good farmer asks the same\r\nquestion: “Where can I get ammonia?” Before we attempt to answer the\r\nquestion, let us look at the next year’s experiments.--The following\r\nis the results of the experiments the _seventh_ year, 1849-50.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Experiments at Rothamsted on the Growth of Wheat, Year After Year,\r\n  on the Same Land.\r\n\r\n  Table VII.--Manures and Produce; 7th Season, 1849-50.

It will\r\nbe seen that on all the plots the yield of grain is considerably lower\r\nthan last year, with a greater growth of straw.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that 10_b_, which last year gave, with ammonia-salts\r\nalone, 32¼ bushels, this year, with superphosphate, potash, soda, and\r\nsulphate of magnesia, gives less than 18 bushels, while the adjoining\r\nplot, dressed with ammonia, gives nearly 27 bushels. In other words, the\r\nammonia alone gives 9 bushels per acre more than this large dressing of\r\nsuperphosphate, potash, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the three plots, 8_a_, 8_b_ and 9_a_, a dressing of ammonia-salts\r\nalone gives in _each case_, a larger yield, both of grain and straw,\r\nthan the 14 tons of barn-yard manure on plot 2. And recollect that this\r\nplot has now received 98 tons of manure in seven years.\r\n\r\n“That,” said the Doctor, “is certainly a very remarkable fact.”\r\n\r\n“It is so,” said the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“But what of it?” asked the Squire, “even the Professor, here, does not\r\nadvise the use of ammonia-salts for wheat.”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” said I, “but perhaps I am mistaken. Such facts as those\r\njust given, though I have been acquainted with them for many years,\r\nsometimes incline me to doubt the soundness of my conclusions. Still, on\r\nthe whole, I think I am right.”\r\n\r\n“We all know,” said the Deacon, “that you have great respect for your\r\nown opinions.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind all that,” said the Doctor, “but tell us just what you think\r\non this subject.”\r\n\r\n“In brief,” said I, “my opinion is this. We need ammonia for wheat. But\r\nthough ammonia-salts and nitrate of soda can often be used with decided\r\nprofit, yet I feel sure that we can get ammonia or nitrogen at a less\r\ncost per lb. by buying bran, malt-roots, cotton-seed cake, and other\r\nfoods, and using them for the double purpose of feeding stock and making\r\nmanure.”\r\n\r\n“I admit that such is the case,” said the Doctor, “but here is a plot of\r\nland that has now had 14 tons of manure every year for seven years, and\r\nyet there is a plot along side, dressed with ammonia-salts furnishing\r\nless than half the ammonia contained in the 14 tons of manure, that\r\nproduces a better yield of wheat.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said I, “is simply because the nitrogen in the manure is not in\r\nan available condition. And the practical question is, how to make the\r\nnitrogen in our manure more immediately available. It is one of the most\r\nimportant questions which agricultural science is called upon to answer.\r\nUntil we get more light, I feel sure in saying that one of the best\r\nmethods is, to feed our animals on richer and more easily digested\r\nfood.”\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the results of the _eighth_ season of 1850-51.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Experiments at Rothamsted on the Growth of Wheat, Year After Year,\r\n  on the Same Land.\r\n\r\n  Table VIII.--Manures and Produce; 8th Season, 1850-51.

This is\r\nremarkable uniformity.\r\n\r\n400 lbs. ammonia-salts and a large quantity of mineral manures in\r\naddition, on _twelve_ different plots, average not quite 32 bushels per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n“The superphosphate and minerals,” said the Deacon, “do not seem to do\r\nmuch good, that is a fact.”\r\n\r\nYou will notice that 336 lbs. of common salt was sown on plot 16_a_. It\r\ndoes not seem to have done the slightest good. Where the salt was used,\r\nthere is 2 lbs. less grain and 98 lbs. less straw than on the adjoining\r\nplot 16_b_, where no salt was used, but otherwise manured alike. It\r\nwould seem, however, that the quality of the grain was slightly improved\r\nby the salt. The salt was sown in March as a top-dressing.\r\n\r\n“It would have been better,” said the Deacon. “to have sown it in autumn\r\nwith the other manures.”\r\n\r\n“The Deacon is right,” said I, “but it so happens that the next year and\r\nthe year after, the salt _was_ applied at the same time as the other\r\nmanures. It gave an increase of 94 lbs. of grain and 61 lbs. of straw in\r\n1851, but the following year the same quantity of salt used on the same\r\nplot did more harm than good.”\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the results of this year, it should be observed that on\r\n8_a_, 5,000 lbs. of cut straw and chaff were used per acre. I do not\r\nrecollect seeing anything in regard to it. And yet the result was very\r\nremarkable--so much so indeed, that it is a matter of regret that the\r\nexperiment was not repeated.\r\n\r\nThis 5,000 lbs. of straw and chaff gave an increase of more than 10\r\nbushels per acre over the continuously unmanured plot.\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the Deacon, “I have always told you that you\r\nunder-estimated the value of straw, especially in regard to its\r\n_mechanical_ action.”\r\n\r\nI did not reply to this remark of the good Deacon. I have never doubted\r\nthe good effects of anything that lightens up a clay soil and renders it\r\nwarmer and more porous. I suppose the great benefit derived from this\r\napplication of straw must be attributed to its ameliorating action on\r\nthe soil. The 5,000 lbs. of straw and chaff produced a crop within\r\nnearly 3 bushels per acre of the plot manured every year with 14 tons of\r\nbarn-yard manure.\r\n\r\n“I am surprised,” said the Doctor, “that salt did no good. I have seen\r\nmany instances in which it has had a wonderful effect on wheat.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “and our experienced friend, John Johnston, is very\r\ndecidedly of the opinion that its use is highly profitable. He sows a\r\nbarrel of salt per acre broadcast on the land at the time he sows his\r\nwheat, and I have myself seen it produce a decided improvement in the\r\ncrop.”\r\n\r\nWe have now given the results of the first _eight_ years of the\r\nexperiments. From this time forward, the _same manures_ were used year\r\nafter year on the same plot.\r\n\r\nThe results are given in the accompanying tables for the following\r\ntwelve years--harvests for 1852-53-54-55-56-57-58-59-60-61-62 and 1863.\r\nSuch another set of experiments are not to be found in the world, and\r\nthey deserve and will receive the careful study of every intelligent\r\nAmerican farmer.\r\n\r\n“I am with you there,” said the Deacon. “You seem to think that I do not\r\nappreciate the labors of scientific men.

It will be seen that the wheat, both in quantity and quality, is\r\nthe poorest since the commencement of the experiments. The unmanured\r\nplot gave less than 14 bushels of dressed grain per acre; the plot with\r\nbarn-yard manure, less than 28 bushels, and the best yield in the whole\r\nseries was not quite 29 bushels per acre, and only weighed 55 lbs. per\r\nbushel. On the same plot, the year before, with precisely the same\r\nmanure, the yield was nearly 37 bushels per acre, and the weight per\r\nbushel, 63½ lbs. So much for a favorable and an unfavorable season.\r\n\r\nThe _tenth_ season (1852-3), was still more unfavorable. The autumn of\r\n1852 was so wet that it was impossible to work the land and sow the\r\nwheat until the 16th of March 1853.\r\n\r\nYou will see that the produce on the unmanured plot was less than 6\r\nbushels per acre. With barn-yard manure, 19 bushels, and with a heavy\r\ndressing of ammonia-salts and minerals, not quite 26 bushels per acre.\r\nWith a heavy dressing of superphosphate, not quite 9¼ bushels per acre,\r\nand with a full dressing of mixed mineral manures and superphosphate, 10\r\nbushels per acre.\r\n\r\nThe weight per bushel on the unmanured plot was 45 lbs.; with mixed\r\nmineral manures, 48½ lbs.; with ammonia-salts alone, 48½ lbs.; with\r\nbarn-yard manure, 51 lbs.; and with ammonia-salts and mixed mineral\r\nmanures, 52¼ lbs.\r\n\r\nFarmers are greatly dependent on the season, but the good farmer, who\r\nkeeps up the fertility of his land stands a better chance of making\r\nmoney (or of losing less), than the farmer who depends on the unaided\r\nproducts of the soil. The one gets 6 bushels per acre, and 1,413 lbs. of\r\nstraw of very inferior quality; the other gets 20 to 26 bushels per\r\nacre, and 5,000 lbs. of straw. And you must recollect that in an\r\nunfavorable season we are pretty certain to get high prices.\r\n\r\nThe _eleventh_ season (1853-4,) gives us much more attractive-looking\r\nfigures! We have over 21 bushels per acre on the plot which has grown\r\neleven crops of wheat in eleven years without any manure.\r\n\r\nWith barn-yard manure, over 41 bushels per acre. With ammonia-salts\r\nalone (17_a_), 45¾ bushels. With ammonia-salts and mixed minerals,\r\n(16_b_), over 50 bushels per acre, and 6,635 lbs. of straw. A total\r\nproduce of nearly 5½ tons per acre.\r\n\r\nThe _twelfth_ season (1854-5), gives us 17 bushels of wheat per acre on\r\nthe continuously unmanured plot. Over 34½ bushels on the plot manured\r\nwith barn-yard manure. And I think, for the first time since the\r\ncommencement of the experiments, this plot produces the largest yield of\r\nany plot in the field. And well it may, for it has now had, in twelve\r\nyears, 168 tons of barn-yard manure per acre!\r\n\r\nSeveral of the plots with ammonia-salts and mixed minerals, are nearly\r\nup to it in grain, and ahead of it in straw.\r\n\r\nThe _thirteenth_ season (1855-6), gives 14½ bushels on the unmanured\r\nplot; over 36¼ bushels on the plot manured with barn-yard manure; and\r\nover 40 bushels on 8_a_, dressed with 600 lbs. ammonia-salts and mixed\r\nmineral manures. It will be noticed that 800 lbs. ammonia-salts does not\r\ngive quite as large a yield this year as 600 lbs. I suppose 40 bushels\r\nper acre was all that the _season_ was capable of producing, and an\r\nextra quantity of ammonia did no good. 400 lbs. of ammonia-salts, on\r\n7_a_, produced 37¼ bushels per acre, and 800 lbs. on 16_b_, only 37¾\r\nbushels. That extra half bushel of wheat was produced at considerable\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThe _fourteenth_ season (1856-7), gives 20 bushels per acre on the\r\nunmanured plot, and 41 bushels on the plot with barn-yard manure. Mixed\r\nmineral manures alone on 5_a_ gives nearly 23 bushels per acre. Mixed\r\nmineral manures and 200 lbs. ammonia-salts, on 6_a_, give 35¼ bushels.\r\nIn other words the ammonia gives us over 12 extra bushels of wheat, and\r\n1,140 lbs. of straw. Mineral manures and 400 lbs. ammonia-salts, on\r\n7_b_, give 46¼ bushels per acre. Mineral manures and 600 lbs.\r\nammonia-salts, on 8_b_, give nearly 49 bushels per acre. Mineral manures\r\nand 800 lbs. of ammonia-salts, on 16_b_, give 50 bushels per acre, and\r\n4,703 lbs. of straw.\r\n\r\n“This exceedingly heavy manuring,” said the Deacon, “does not pay. For\r\ninstance,\r\n\r\n  “200 lbs. ammonia-salts give an increase of 12¼ bushels per acre.\r\n   400  ”      ”     ”           ”            23¼      ”     ”\r\n   600  ”      ”     ”           ”            26       ”     ”\r\n   800  ”      ”     ”           ”            27       ”     ”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon is right, and Mr. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert call especial\r\nattention to this point. The 200 lbs. of ammonia-salts contain about 50\r\nlbs. of ammonia, and the 400 lbs., 100 lbs. of ammonia. And as I have\r\nsaid, 100 lbs. of ammonia per acre is an unusually heavy dressing. It is\r\nas much ammonia as is contained in 1,000 lbs. of average Peruvian guano.\r\nWe will recur to this subject.\r\n\r\nThe _fifteenth_ season (1857-8,) gives a yield of 18 bushels of wheat\r\nper acre on the continuously unmanured plot, and nearly 39 bushels on\r\nthe plot continuously manured with 14 tons of barnyard manure. Mixed\r\nmineral manures on 5_a_ and 5_b_, give a mean yield of less than 19\r\nbushels per acre.\r\n\r\nMixed mineral manures and 100 lbs. ammonia-salts, on plots 21 and 22,\r\ngive 23¼ bushels per acre. In other words:\r\n\r\n   25 lbs. ammonia,           gives an _increase_ of  4¼ bush.\r\n     (100 lbs. ammonia-salts)\r\n   50  ”      ”   ,             ”   ”       ”     ”  10       ”\r\n     (200  ”      ”      ”  )\r\n  100  ”      ”   ,             ”   ”       ”     ”  20       ”\r\n     (400  ”      ”      ”  )\r\n  150  ”      ”   ,             ”   ”       ”     ”  23       ”\r\n     (600  ”      ”      ”  )\r\n  200  ”      ”   ,             ”   ”       ”     ”  23       ”\r\n     (800  ”      ”      ”  )\r\n\r\n“It takes,” said the Deacon, “about 5 lbs. of ammonia to produce a\r\nbushel of wheat. And according to this, 500 lbs. of Peruvian guano,\r\nguaranteed to contain 10 per cent of ammonia, would give an increase of\r\n10 bushels of wheat.”\r\n\r\n“This is a very interesting matter,” said I, “but we will not discuss it\r\nat present. Let us continue the examination of the subject. I do not\r\npropose to make many remarks on the tables. You must study them for\r\nyourself. I have spent hours and days and weeks making and pondering\r\nover these tables. The more you study them the more interesting and\r\ninstructive they become.”\r\n\r\nThe _sixteenth_ season (1858-9), gives us a little over 18¼ bushels on\r\nthe unmanured plot. On the plot manured with 14 tons farmyard manure,\r\n36¼ bushels; and this is the highest yield this season in the\r\nwheat-field. Mixed mineral manures alone, (mean of plot 5_a_ and 5_b_),\r\ngive 20½ bushels.\r\n\r\n25 lbs. ammonia (100 lbs. ammonia-salts), and mixed minerals, give 25¼\r\nbushels, or an _increase_ over minerals alone of 4¾ bushels.\r\n\r\n   50 lbs. ammonia, an increase of  9¼ bushels.\r\n  100  ”      ”     ”     ”     ”  14        ”\r\n  150  ”      ”     ”     ”     ”  14        ”\r\n  200  ”      ”     ”     ”     ”  14¼       ”\r\n\r\nThe season was an unfavorable one for excessive manuring. It was too wet\r\nand the crops of wheat when highly manured were much laid. The quality\r\nof the grain was inferior, as will be seen from the light weight per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nThe _seventeenth_ season (1859-60,) gives less than 13 bushels per acre\r\non the unmanured plot; and 32¼ bushels on the plot manured with 14 tons\r\nfarm-yard manure. This season (1860), was a miserable year for wheat in\r\nEngland. It was both cold and wet. Mixed mineral manures, on plots 5_a_\r\nand 5_b_, gave nearly 16 bushels per acre. 25 lbs. ammonia, in addition\r\nto the above, gave less than 15 bushels. In other words it gave no\r\n_increase_ at all.\r\n\r\n   50 lbs. ammonia, gave an _increase_ of  6  bushels.\r\n  100  ”      ”      ”   ”    ”        ”  11¾    ”\r\n  150  ”      ”      ”   ”    ”        ”  15¼    ”\r\n  200  ”      ”      ”   ”    ”        ”  16¾    ”\r\n\r\nIt was a poor year for the wheat-grower, and that, whether he manured\r\nexcessively, liberally, moderately, or not at all.\r\n\r\n“I do not quite see that,” said the Deacon, “the farm-yard manure gave\r\nan _increase_ of nearly 20 bushels per acre. And the quality of the\r\ngrain must have been much better, as it weighed 3½ lbs. per bushel more\r\nthan the plot unmanured. If the wheat doubled in price, as it ought to\r\ndo in such a poor year, I do not see but that the good farmer who had in\r\nprevious years made his land rich, would come out ahead.”\r\n\r\n“Good for the Deacon,” said I. “‘Is Saul also among the prophets?’” If\r\nthe Deacon continues to study these experiments much longer, we shall\r\nhave him advocating chemical manures and high farming!\r\n\r\nThe _eighteenth_ season (1860-1,) gave less than 11½ bushels per acre on\r\nthe unmanured plot; and nearly 35 bushels on the manured plot.\r\n\r\n  The mixed mineral manures, gave nearly            15½ bushels.\r\n        ”      ”        ”    and  25 lbs. ammonia   18¼      ”\r\n        ”      ”        ”     ”   50   ”     ”      27¾      ”\r\n        ”      ”        ”     ”  100   ”     ”      35       ”\r\n        ”      ”        ”     ”  150   ”     ”      35       ”\r\n        ”      ”        ”     ”  200   ”     ”      37       ”\r\n\r\nThe _nineteenth_ season (1861-2,) gave 16 bushels per acre on the\r\nunmanured plot, and over 38¼ bushels on the plot manured with farm-yard\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\n  Mixed mineral manures, gave nearly            18  bushels per acre.\r\n    ”      ”       ”   and  25 lbs. ammonia     20¼    ”       ”\r\n    ”      ”       ”    ”   50  ”      ”        28¼    ”       ”\r\n    ”      ”       ”    ”  100  ”      ”        36     ”       ”\r\n    ”      ”       ”    ”  150  ”      ”        39½    ”       ”\r\n    ”      ”       ”    ”  200  ”      ”        36¼    ”       ”\r\n\r\nThe _twentieth_ season (1862-3), gave 17¼ bushels on the unmanured plot,\r\nand 44 bushels per acre on the manured plot.\r\n\r\n  Mixed mineral manures alone gave            19¾ bushels per acre.\r\n    ”      ”       ”    and  25 lbs. ammonia  28¾        ”      ”\r\n    ”      ”       ”     ”   50  ”       ”    39¾        ”      ”\r\n    ”      ”       ”     ”  100  ”       ”    53¾        ”      ”\r\n    ”      ”       ”     ”  150  ”       ”    55¾        ”      ”\r\n    ”      ”       ”     ”  200  ”       ”    56         ”      ”\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that this is the twentieth wheat-crop in succession on\r\nthe same land, these figures are certainly remarkable.\r\n\r\n“They are so,” said the Deacon, “and what to me is the most surprising\r\nthing about the whole matter is, that the plot which has had no manure\r\nof any kind for 25 years, and has grown 20 wheat-crops in 20 successive\r\nyears, should still produce a crop of wheat of 17¼ bushels per acre.\r\nMany of our farmers do not average 10 bushels per acre. Mr. Lawes must\r\neither have very good land, or else the climate of England is better\r\nadapted for wheat-growing than Western New York.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think,” said I, “that Mr. Lawes’ land is any better than yours\r\nor mine; and I do not think the climate of England is any more favorable\r\nfor growing wheat without manure than our climate. If there is any\r\ndifference it is in our favor.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then,” asked the Doctor, “do we not grow as much wheat per acre as\r\nMr. Lawes gets from his continuously unmanured plot?”\r\n\r\nThis is a question not difficult to answer.\r\n\r\n1st. _We grow too many weeds._ Mr. Lawes plowed the land twice every\r\nyear; and the crop was hoed once or twice in the spring to kill the\r\nweeds.\r\n\r\n2d. We do not half work our heavy land. We do not plow it enough--do not\r\ncultivate, harrow, and roll enough. I have put wheat in on my own farm,\r\nand have seen others do the same thing, when the drill on the clay-spots\r\ncould not deposit the seed an inch deep. There is “plant-food” enough in\r\nthese “clay-spots” to give 17 bushels of wheat per acre--or perhaps 40\r\nbushels--but we shall not get ten bushels. The wheat will not come up\r\nuntil late in the autumn--the plants will be weak and thin on the\r\nground; and if they escape the winter they will not get a fair hold of\r\nthe ground until April or May. You know the result. The straw is full of\r\nsap, and is almost sure to rust; the grain shrinks up, and we harvest\r\nthe crop, not because it is worth the labor, but because we cannot cut\r\nthe wheat with a machine on the better parts of the field without\r\ncutting these poor spots also. An acre or two of poor spots pull down\r\nthe average yield of the field below the average of Mr. Lawes’\r\nwell-worked but unmanured land.\r\n\r\n3d. Much of our wheat is seriously injured by stagnant water _in the\r\nsoil_, and standing water on the surface. I think we may safely say that\r\none-third the wheat-crop of this county (Monroe Co., N.Y.), is lost for\r\nwant of better tillage and better draining--and yet we think we have as\r\ngood wheat-land and are as good farmers as can be found in this country\r\nor any other!\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless we drain land, where drainage is needed, and unless we work land\r\nthoroughly that needs working, and unless we kill the weeds or check\r\ntheir excessive growth, it is poor economy to sow expensive manures on\r\nour wheat-crops.\r\n\r\nBut I do not think there is much danger of our falling into this error.\r\nThe farmers who try artificial manures are the men who usually take the\r\ngreatest pains to make the best and most manure from the animals kept on\r\nthe farm. They know what manures cost and what they are worth. As a\r\nrule, too, such men are good farmers, and endeavor to work their land\r\nthoroughly and keep it clean. When this is the case, there can be little\r\ndoubt that we can often use artificial manures to great advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n“You say,” said the Deacon, who had been looking over the tables while I\r\nwas talking, “that mixed mineral manures and 50 lbs. of ammonia give 39¾\r\nbushels per acre. Now these mixed mineral manures contain potash, soda,\r\nmagnesia, and superphosphate. And I see where superphosphate was used\r\nwithout any potash, soda, and magnesia, but with the same amount of\r\nammonia, the yield is nearly 46 bushels per acre. This does not say much\r\nin favor of potash, soda, and magnesia, as manures, for wheat. Again,\r\nI see, on plot 10_b_, 50 lbs. of ammonia, _alone_, gives over 43½\r\nbushels per acre. On plot 11_b_, 50 lbs. ammonia _and_ superphosphate,\r\ngive 46½ bushels. Like your father, I am inclined to ask, ‘_Where can I\r\nget this ammonia?_’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nLIME AS A MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese careful, systematic, and long-continued experiments of Lawes and\r\nGilbert seem to prove that if you have a piece of land well prepared for\r\nwheat, which will produce, without manure, say 15 bushels per acre,\r\nthere is no way of making that land produce 30 bushels of wheat per\r\nacre, without directly or indirectly furnishing the soil with a liberal\r\nsupply of available nitrogen or ammonia.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by directly or indirectly?” asked the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“What I had in my mind,” said I, “was the fact that I have seen a good\r\ndressing of lime double the yield of wheat. In such a case I suppose the\r\nlime decomposes the organic matter in the soil, or in some other way\r\nsets free the nitrogen or ammonia already in the soil; or the lime forms\r\ncompounds in the soil which attract ammonia from the atmosphere. Be this\r\nas it may, the facts brought out by Mr. Lawes’ experiments warrant us in\r\nconcluding that the increased growth of wheat was connected in some way\r\nwith an increased supply of available nitrogen or ammonia.”\r\n\r\nMy father used great quantities of lime as manure. He drew it a distance\r\nof 13 miles, and usually applied it on land intended for wheat,\r\nspreading it broad-cast, after the land had received its last plowing,\r\nand harrowing it in, a few days or weeks before sowing the wheat.\r\nHe rarely applied less than 100 bushels of stone-lime to the\r\nacre--generally 150 bushels. He used to say that a small dose of lime\r\ndid little or no good. He wanted to use enough to change the general\r\ncharacter of the land--to make the light land firmer and the heavy land\r\nlighter.\r\n\r\nWhile I was with Mr. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert at Rothamsted, I went home on\r\na visit. My father had a four-horse team drawing lime every day, and\r\nputting it in large heaps in the field to slake, before spreading it on\r\nthe land for wheat.\r\n\r\n“I do not believe it pays you to draw so much lime,” said I, with the\r\nconfidence which a young man who has learned a little of agricultural\r\nchemistry, is apt to feel in his newly acquired knowledge.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” said my father, “but we have got to do something for the\r\nland, or the crops will be poor, and poor crops do not pay these times.\r\nWhat would you use instead of lime?” --“Lime is not a manure, strictly\r\nspeaking,” said I; “a bushel to the acre would furnish all the lime the\r\ncrops require, even if there was not an abundant supply already in the\r\nsoil. If you mix lime with guano, it sets free the ammonia; and when you\r\nmix lime with the soil it probably decomposes some compounds containing\r\nammonia or the elements of ammonia, and thus furnishes a supply of\r\nammonia for the plants. I think it would be cheaper to buy ammonia in\r\nthe shape of Peruvian guano.”\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, my father asked me to take a walk over the farm. We came\r\nto a field of barley. Standing at one end of the field, about the\r\nmiddle, he asked me if I could see any difference in the crop. “Oh,\r\nyes,” I replied, “the barley on the right-hand is far better than on the\r\nleft hand. The straw is stiffer and brighter, and the heads larger and\r\nheavier. I should think the right half of the field will be ten bushels\r\nper acre better than the other.”\r\n\r\n“So I think,” he said, “and now can you tell me why?” --“Probably you\r\nmanured one half the field for turnips, and not the other half.” --“No.”\r\n--“You may have drawn off the turnips from half the field, and fed them\r\noff by sheep on the other half.” --“No, both sides were treated\r\nprecisely alike.” --I gave it up --“Well,” said he, “this half the\r\nfield on the right-hand was limed, thirty years ago, and that is the\r\nonly reason I know for the difference. And now you need not tell me that\r\nlime does not pay.”\r\n\r\nI can well understand how this might happen. The system of rotation\r\nadopted was, 1st clover, 2d wheat, 3d turnips, 4th barley, seeded with\r\nclover.\r\n\r\nNow, you put on, say 150 bushels of lime for wheat. After the wheat the\r\nland is manured and sown with turnips. The turnips are eaten off on the\r\nland by sheep; and it is reasonable to suppose that on the half of the\r\nfield dressed with lime there would be a much heavier crop of turnips.\r\nThese turnips being eaten off by the sheep would furnish more manure for\r\nthis half than the other half. Then again, when the land was in grass or\r\nclover, the limed half would afford more and sweeter grass and clover\r\nthan the other half, and the sheep would remain on it longer. They would\r\neat it close into the ground, going only on to the other half when they\r\ncould not get enough to eat on the limed half. More of their droppings\r\nwould be left on the limed half of the field. The lime, too, would\r\ncontinue to act for several years; but even after all direct benefit\r\nfrom the lime had ceased, it is easy to understand why the crops might\r\nbe better for a long period of time.\r\n\r\n“Do you think lime would do any good,” asked the Deacon, “on our\r\nlimestone land?”--I certainly do. So far as I have seen, it does just as\r\nmuch good here in Western New York, as it did on my father’s farm.\r\nI should use it very freely if we could get it cheap enough--but we are\r\ncharged from 25 to 30 cts. a bushel for it, and I do not think at these\r\nrates it will pay to use it. Even gold may be bought too dear.\r\n\r\n“You should burn your own lime,” said the Deacon, “you have plenty of\r\nlimestone on the farm, and could use up your down wood.”--I believe it\r\nwould pay me to do so, but one man cannot do everything. I think if\r\nfarmers would use more lime for manure we should get it cheaper. The\r\ndemand would increase with competition, and we should soon get it at its\r\nreal value. At 10 to 15 cents a bushel, I feel sure that we could use\r\nlime as a manure with very great benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I was much interested some years ago,” said the Doctor, “in the results\r\nof Prof. Way’s investigations in regard to the absorptive powers of\r\nsoils.”\r\n\r\nHis experiments, since repeated and confirmed by other chemists, formed\r\na new epoch in agricultural chemistry. They afforded some new\r\nsuggestions in regard to how lime may benefit land.\r\n\r\nProf. Way found that ordinary soils possessed the power of separating,\r\nfrom solution in water, the different earthy and alkaline substances\r\npresented to them in manure; thus, when solutions of salts of ammonia,\r\nof potash, magnesia, etc., were made to filter slowly through a bed of\r\ndry soil, five or six inches deep, arranged in a flower-pot, or other\r\nsuitable vessel, it was observed that the liquid which ran through, no\r\nlonger contained any of the ammonia or other salt employed. The soil\r\nhad, in some form or other, retained the alkaline substance, while the\r\nwater in which it was previously dissolved passed through.\r\n\r\nFurther, this power of the soil was found not to extend to the whole\r\nsalt of ammonia or potash, but only to the alkali itself. If, for\r\ninstance, sulphate of ammonia were the compound used in the experiments,\r\nthe ammonia would be removed from solution, but the filtered liquid\r\nwould contain sulphuric acid in abundance--not in the free or uncombined\r\nform, but united to lime; instead of sulphate of ammonia we should find\r\nsulphate of lime in the solution; and this result was obtained, whatever\r\nthe acid of the salt experimented upon might be.\r\n\r\nIt was found, moreover, that the process of filtration was by no means\r\nnecessary; by the mere mixing of an alkaline solution with a proper\r\nquantity of soil, as by shaking them together in a bottle, and allowing\r\nthe soil to subside, the same result was obtained. The action,\r\ntherefore, was in no way referable to any physical law brought into\r\noperation by the process of filtration.\r\n\r\nIt was also found that the combination between the soil and the alkaline\r\nsubstance was rapid, if not instantaneous, partaking of the nature of\r\nthe ordinary union between an acid and an alkali.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these experiments, several different soils were\r\noperated upon, and it was found that all soils capable of profitable\r\ncultivation possessed this property in a greater or less degree.\r\n\r\nPure sand, it was found, did not possess this property. The organic\r\nmatter of the soil, it was proved, had nothing to do with it. The\r\naddition of carbonate of lime to a soil did not increase its absorptive\r\npower, and indeed it was found that a soil in which carbonate of lime\r\ndid not exist, possessed in a high degree the power of removing ammonia\r\nor potash from solution.\r\n\r\nTo what, then, is the power of soils to arrest ammonia, potash,\r\nmagnesia, phosphoric acid, etc., owing? The above experiments lead to\r\nthe conclusion that it is due to the _clay_ which they contain. In the\r\nlanguage of Prof. Way, however,\r\n\r\n“It still remained to be considered, whether the whole clay took any\r\nactive part in these changes, or whether there existed in clay some\r\nchemical compound in small quantity to which the action was due. This\r\nquestion was to be decided by the extent to which clay was able to unite\r\nwith ammonia, or other alkaline bases; and it soon became evident that\r\nthe idea of the clay as a whole, being the cause of the absorptive\r\nproperty, was inconsistent with all the ascertained laws of chemical\r\ncombination.”\r\n\r\nAfter a series of experiments, Prof. Way came to the conclusion that\r\nthere is in clays a peculiar class of double silicates to which the\r\nabsorptive properties of soil are due. He found that the double silicate\r\nof alumina and lime, or soda, whether found naturally in soils or\r\nproduced artificially, would be decomposed when a salt of ammonia, or\r\npotash, etc., was mixed with it, the ammonia, or potash, taking the\r\nplace of the lime or soda.\r\n\r\nProf. Way’s discovery, then, is not that soils have “absorptive\r\nproperties”--that has been long known--but that they absorb ammonia,\r\npotash, phosphoric acid, etc., by virtue of the double silicate of\r\nalumina and soda, or lime, etc., which they contain.\r\n\r\nSoils are also found to have the power of absorbing ammonia, or rather\r\n_carbonate_ of ammonia, from the air.\r\n\r\n“It has long been known,” says Prof. Way, “that soils acquire fertility\r\nby exposure to the influence of the atmosphere--hence one of the uses of\r\nfallows. * * I find that clay is so greedy of ammonia, that if air,\r\ncharged with carbonate of ammonia, so as to be highly pungent, is passed\r\nthrough a tube filled with small fragments of dry clay, _every particle\r\nof the gas is arrested_.”\r\n\r\nThis power of the soil to absorb ammonia, is also due to the double\r\nsilicates. But there is this remarkable difference, that while either\r\nthe lime, soda, or potash silicate is capable of removing the ammonia\r\nfrom _solution_, the _lime_ silicate alone _has the power of absorbing\r\nit from the air_.\r\n\r\nThis is an important fact. Lime may act beneficially on many or most\r\nsoils by converting the soda silicate into a lime silicate, or, in other\r\nwords, converting a salt that will not absorb carbonate of ammonia from\r\nthe air, into a salt that has this important property.\r\n\r\nThere is no manure that has been so extensively used, and with such\r\ngeneral success as lime, and yet, “who among us,” remarks Prof. Way,\r\n“can say that he perfectly understands the mode in which lime acts?” We\r\nare told that lime sweetens the soil, by neutralizing any acid character\r\nthat it may possess; that it assists the decomposition of inert organic\r\nmatters, and therefore increases the supply of vegetable food to plants:\r\nthat it decomposes the remains of ancient rocks containing potash, soda,\r\nmagnesia, etc., occurring in most soils, and that at the same time it\r\nliberates silica from these rocks; and lastly, that lime is one of the\r\nsubstances found uniformly and in considerable quantity in the ashes of\r\nplants, that therefore its application may be beneficial simply as\r\nfurnishing a material indispensable to the substance of a plant.\r\n\r\nThese explanations are no doubt good as far as they go, but experience\r\nfurnishes many facts which cannot be explained by any one, or all, of\r\nthese suppositions. Lime, we all know, does much good on soils abounding\r\nin organic matter, and so it frequently does on soils almost destitute\r\nof it. It may liberate potash, soda, silica, etc., from clay soils, but\r\nthe application of potash, soda, and silica has little beneficial effect\r\non the soil, and therefore we cannot account for the action of lime on\r\nthe supposition that it renders the potash, soda, etc., of the soil\r\navailable to plants. Furthermore, lime effects great good on soils\r\nabounding in salts of lime, and therefore it cannot be that it operates\r\nas a source of lime for the structure of the plant.\r\n\r\nNone of the existing theories, therefore, satisfactorily account for the\r\naction of lime. Prof. Way’s views are most consistent with the facts of\r\npractical experience; but they are confessedly hypothetical; and his\r\nmore recent investigations do not confirm the idea that lime acts\r\nbeneficially by converting the soda silicate into the lime silicate.\r\n\r\nThus, six soils were treated with lime water until they had absorbed\r\nfrom one and a half to two per cent of their weight of lime. This,\r\nsupposing the soil to be six inches deep, would be at the rate of about\r\n300 bushels of lime per acre. The amount of ammonia in the soil was\r\ndetermined before liming, after liming, and then after being exposed to\r\nthe fumes of carbonate ammonia until it had absorbed as much as it\r\nwould. The following table exhibits the results:\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                              |No. 1.|No. 2.|No. 3.|No. 4.|No. 5.|No. 6.\r\n  ----------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n  Ammonia in 1,000 grains     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n    of natural soil           | 0.293| 0.181| 0.085| 0.109| 0.127| 0.083\r\n  Ammonia in 1,000 grains     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n    of soil after liming      | 0.169| 0.102| 0.040| 0.050|  ... | 0.051\r\n  Ammonia in 1,000 grains of  |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n    soil after liming and     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n    exposure to the vapor     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n    of ammonia                | 2.226| 2.066| 3.297| 1.076| 3.265| 1.827\r\n  Ammonia in 1,000 grains     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n    of soil after exposure to |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n    ammonia without liming.   | 1.906| 2.557| 3.286| 1.097| 2.615| 2.028\r\n  ----------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\n    No. 1.

This negative\r\nresult, however, does not disprove the truth of Prof. Way’s hypothesis,\r\nfor it may be that the silicate salt in the natural soils was that of\r\nlime and not that of soda. Indeed, the extent to which the natural soils\r\nabsorbed ammonia--equal, in No. 3, to about 7,000 lbs. of ammonia per\r\nacre, equivalent to the quantity contained in 700 tons of barn-yard\r\nmanure--shows this to have been the case.\r\n\r\n_The lime liberated one-half the ammonia contained in the soil._\r\n\r\n“This result,” says Prof. Way, “is so nearly the same in all cases, that\r\nwe are justified in believing it to be due to some special cause, and\r\nprobably it arises from the existence of some compound silicates\r\ncontaining ammonia, of which lime under the circumstances can replace\r\none-half--forming, for instance, a double silicate of alumina, with half\r\nlime and half ammonia--such compounds are not unusual or new to the\r\nchemist.”\r\n\r\nThis loss of ammonia from a heavy dressing of lime is very great. A soil\r\nfive inches deep, weighs, in round numbers, 500 tons, or 1,000,000 lbs.\r\nThe soil, No. 1, contained .0293 per cent of ammonia, or in an acre,\r\nfive inches deep, 293 lbs. After liming, it contained .0169 per cent, or\r\nin an acre, five inches deep, 169 lbs. The loss by liming is 124 lbs. of\r\nammonia per acre. This is equal to the quantity contained in 1200 lbs.\r\nof good Peruvian guano, or 12½ tons of barn-yard manure.\r\n\r\nIn commenting on this great loss of ammonia from liming, Prof. Way\r\nobserves:\r\n\r\n“Is it not possible, that for the profitable agricultural use, the\r\nammonia of the soil is too tightly locked up in it? Can we suppose that\r\nthe very powers of the soil to unite with and preserve the elements of\r\nmanure are, however excellent a provision of nature, yet in some degree\r\nopposed to the growth of the abnormal crops which it is the business of\r\nthe farmer to cultivate? There is no absolute reason why such should not\r\nbe the case. A provision of nature must relate to natural circumstances;\r\nfor instance, compounds of ammonia may be found in the soil, capable of\r\ngiving out to the agencies of water and air quite enough of ammonia for\r\nthe growth of ordinary plants and the preservation of their species;\r\nbut this supply may be totally inadequate to the necessities of man.\r\n*  *  * Now it is not impossible that the laws which preserve the\r\nsupply of vegetable nutrition in the soil, are too stringent for the\r\nrequirements of an unusual and excessive vegetation, such as the\r\ncultivator must promote.\r\n\r\n“In the case of ammonia locked up in the soil, lime may be the remedy at\r\nthe command of the farmer--his means of rendering immediately available\r\nstores of wealth, which can otherwise only slowly be brought into use.\r\n\r\n“In this view, lime would well deserve the somewhat vague name that has\r\nbeen given it, namely, that of a ‘stimulant’; for its application would\r\nbe in some sort an application of ammonia, while its excessive\r\napplication, by driving off ammonia, would lead to all the disastrous\r\neffects which are so justly attributed to it.\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to push this assumption too far,” says Prof. Way, in\r\nconclusion, “but if there be any truth in it, it points out the\r\nimportance of employing lime in small quantities at short intervals,\r\nrather than in large doses once in many years.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Squire, last year,” said the Deacon, “drew several hundred bushels\r\nof refuse lime from the kiln, and mixed it with his manure. It made a\r\npowerful smell, and not an agreeable one, to the passers by. He put the\r\nmixture on a twenty-acre field of wheat, and he said he was going to\r\nbeat you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “so I understood--but he did not do it. If he had applied\r\nthe lime and the manure separately, he would have stood a better chance;\r\nstill, there are two sides to the question. I should not think of mixing\r\nlime with good, rich farm-yard manure; but with long, coarse, strawy\r\nmanure, there would be less injury, and possibly some advantage.”\r\n\r\n“The Squire,” said the Deacon, “got one advantage. He had not much\r\ntrouble in drawing the manure about the land. There was not much of it\r\nleft.”\r\n\r\nLime does not always decompose organic matter. In certain conditions, it\r\nwill _preserve_ vegetable substances. We do not want to mix lime with\r\nmanure in order to preserve it; and if our object is to increase\r\nfermentation, we must be careful to mix sufficient soil with the manure\r\nto keep it moist enough to retain the liberated ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany farmers who use lime for the first time on wheat, are apt to feel a\r\nlittle discouraged in the spring. I have frequently seen limed wheat in\r\nthe spring look worse than where no lime was used. But wait a little,\r\nand you will see a change for the better, and at harvest, the lime will\r\ngenerally give a good account of itself.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing about lime which, if generally true, is an important\r\nmatter to our wheat-growers. Lime is believed to hasten the maturity of\r\nthe crop. “It is true of nearly all our cultivated crops,” says the late\r\nProfessor Johnston, “but especially of those of wheat, that their full\r\ngrowth is attained more speedily when the land is limed, and that they\r\nare ready for the harvest from ten to fourteen days earlier. This is the\r\ncase even with buckwheat, which becomes sooner ripe, though it yields no\r\nlarger a return when lime is applied to the land on which it is grown.”\r\n\r\nIn districts where the midge affects the wheat, it is exceedingly\r\nimportant to get a variety of wheat that ripens early; and if lime will\r\nfavor early maturity, without checking the growth, it will be of great\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent in Delaware writes: “I have used lime as a manure in\r\nvarious ways. For low land, the best way is, to sow it broadcast while\r\nthe vegetation is in a green state, at the rate of 40 or 50 bushels to\r\nthe acre; but if I can not use it before the frost kills the vegetation,\r\nI wait until the land is plowed in the spring, when I spread it on the\r\nplowed ground in about the same quantity as before. Last year, I tried\r\nit both ways, and the result was, my crop was increased at least\r\nfourfold in each instance, but that used on the vegetation was best. The\r\nsoil is a low, black sand.”\r\n\r\nA farmer writes from New Jersey, that he has used over 6,000 bushels of\r\nlime on his farm, and also considerable guano and phosphates, but\r\nconsiders that the lime has paid the best. His farm has more than\r\ndoubled in real value, and he attributes this principally to the use of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\n“We lime,” he says, “whenever it is convenient, but prefer to put it on\r\nat least one year before plowing the land. We spread from 25 to 40\r\nbushels of lime on the sod in the fall; plant with corn the following\r\nsummer; next spring, sow with oats and clover; and the next summer, plow\r\nunder the clover, and sow with wheat and timothy. We have a variety of\r\nsoils, from a sandy loam to a stiff clay, and are certain that lime will\r\npay on all or any of them. Some of the best farmers in our County\r\ncommenced liming when the lime cost 25 cts. a bushel, and their farms\r\nare ahead yet, more in value, I judge, than the lime cost. The man who\r\nfirst commences using lime, will get so far ahead, while his neighbors\r\nare looking on, that they will never catch up.”\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent in Hunterdon Co., N.J., writes: “Experience has\r\ntaught me that the best and most profitable mode of applying lime is on\r\ngrass land. If the grass seed is sown in the fall with the wheat or rye,\r\nwhich is the common practice with us in New Jersey, as soon as the\r\nharvest comes off the next year, we apply the lime with the least delay,\r\nand while fresh slacked and in a dry and mealy state. It can be spread\r\nmore evenly on the ground, and is in a state to be more readily taken up\r\nby the fine roots of the plants, than if allowed to get wet and clammy.\r\nIt is found most beneficial to keep it as near the surface of the ground\r\nas practicable, as the specific gravity or weight of this mineral manure\r\nis so great, that we soon find it too deep in the ground for the fibrous\r\nroots of plants to derive the greatest possible benefit from its use.\r\nWith this method of application are connected several advantages. The\r\nlime can be hauled in the fall, after the busy season is over, and when\r\nspread on the sod in this way, comes in more immediate contact with the\r\ngrass and grass-roots than when the land is first plowed. In fields that\r\nhave been limed in part in this manner, and then plowed, and lime\r\napplied to the remainder at the time of planting with corn, I always\r\nobserve a great difference in the corn-crop; and in plowing up the\r\nstubble the next season, the part limed on the sod is much mellower than\r\nthat limed after the sod was broken, presenting a rich vegetable mould\r\nnot observed in the other part of the field.”\r\n\r\nA farmer in Chester Co., Pa., also prefers to apply lime to newly-seeded\r\ngrass or clover. He puts on 100 bushels of slaked lime per acre, either\r\nin the fall or in the spring, as most convenient. He limes one field\r\nevery year, and as the farm is laid off into eleven fields, all the land\r\nreceives a dressing of lime once in eleven years.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country, where lime has been used for many\r\nyears, it is possible that part of the money might better be used in the\r\npurchase of guano, phosphates, fish-manure, etc.; while in this section,\r\nwhere we seldom use lime, we might find it greatly to our interest to\r\ngive our land an occasional dressing of lime.\r\n\r\nThe value of quick-lime as a manure is not merely in supplying an actual\r\nconstituent of the plant. If it was, a few pounds per acre would be\r\nsufficient. Its value consists in changing the chemical and physical\r\ncharacter of the soil--in developing the latent mineral plant-food, and\r\nin decomposing and rendering available organic matter, and in forming\r\ncompounds which attract ammonia from the atmosphere. It may be that we\r\ncan purchase this ammonia and other plant-food cheaper than we can get\r\nit by using lime. It depends a good deal on the nature and composition\r\nof the soil. At present, this question can not be definitely settled,\r\nexcept by actual trial on the farm. In England, where lime was formerly\r\nused in large quantities, the tendency for some time has been towards a\r\nmore liberal and direct use of ammonia and phosphates in manures, rather\r\nthan to develop them out of the soil by the use of lime. A judicious\r\ncombination of the two systems will probably be found the most\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking composts with old sods, lime, and barn-yard manure, is a\r\ntime-honored practice in Europe. I have seen excellent results from the\r\napplication of such a compost on meadow-land. The usual plan is, to\r\nselect an old hedge-row or headland, which has lain waste for many\r\nyears. Plow it up, and cart the soil, sods, etc., into a long, narrow\r\nheap. Mix lime with it, and let it lie six months or a year. Then turn\r\nit, and as soon as it is fine and mellow, draw it on to the land. I have\r\nassisted at making many a heap of this kind, but do not recollect the\r\nproportion of lime used; in fact, I question if we had any definite\r\nrule. If we wanted to use lime on the land, we put more in the heap; if\r\nnot, less. The manure was usually put in when the heap was turned.\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker analyzed the dry earth used in the closets at the prison in\r\nWakefield, England. He found that:\r\n                                                             Phosphoric\r\n                                                Nitrogen.    Acid.\r\n   10 tons of dry earth before using\r\n       contained                                   63 lbs.    36 lbs.\r\n   10 tons of dry earth after being used once\r\n       contained                                   74  ”      50  ”\r\n   10 tons of dry earth after being used twice\r\n       contained                                   84  ”      88  ”\r\n   10 tons of dry earth after being used thrice\r\n       contained                                  102  ”     102  ”\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the above figures, the Deacon remarked: “You say 10\r\ntons of dry earth before being used in the closet contained 62 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen. How much nitrogen does 10 tons of barn-yard manure contain?”\r\n\r\n“That depends a good deal on what food the animals eat. Ten tons of\r\naverage fresh manure would contain about 80 lbs. of nitrogen.”\r\n\r\n“Great are the mysteries of chemistry!” exclaimed the Deacon. “Ten tons\r\nof dry earth contain almost as much nitrogen as 10 tons of barn-yard\r\nmanure, and yet you think that nitrogen is the most valuable thing in\r\nmanure. What shall we be told next?”\r\n\r\n“You will be told, Deacon, that the nitrogen in the soil is in such a\r\nform that the plants can take up only a small portion of it. But if you\r\nwill plow such land in the fall, and expose it to the disintegrating\r\neffects of the frost, and plow it again in the spring, and let the sun\r\nand air act upon it, more or less of the organic matter in the soil will\r\nbe decomposed, and the nitrogen rendered soluble. And then if you sow\r\nthis land to wheat after a good summer-fallow, you will stand a chance\r\nof having a great crop.”\r\n\r\nThis dry earth which Dr. Vœlcker analyzed appeared, he says, “to be\r\nordinary garden soil, containing a considerable portion of clay.” After\r\nit had been passed once through the closet, one ton of it was spread on\r\nan acre of grass-land, which produced 2 tons 8 cwt. of hay. In a second\r\nexperiment, one ton, once passed through the closet, produced 2 tons 7\r\ncwt. of hay per acre. We are not told how much hay the land produced\r\nwithout any dressing at all. Still we may infer that this top-dressing\r\ndid considerable good. Of one thing, however, there can be no doubt.\r\nThis one ton of earth manure contained only 1¼ lb. more nitrogen and 1½\r\nlb. more phosphoric acid than a ton of the dry earth itself. Why then\r\ndid it prove so valuable as a top-dressing for grass? I will not say\r\nthat it was due solely to the decomposition of the nitrogenous matter\r\nand other plant-food in the earth, caused by the working over and\r\nsifting and exposure to the air, and to the action of the night-soil.\r\nStill it would seem that, so far as the beneficial effect was due to the\r\nsupply of plant-food, we must attribute it to the earth itself rather\r\nthan to the small amount of night-soil which it contained.\r\n\r\nIt is a very common thing in England, as I have said before, for farmers\r\nto make a compost of the sods and earth from an old hedge-row, ditch, or\r\nfence, and mix with it some lime or barn-yard manure. Then, after\r\nturning it once or twice, and allowing it to remain in the heap for a\r\nfew months, to spread it on meadow-land. I have seen great benefit\r\napparently derived from such a top-dressing. The young grass in the\r\nspring assumed a rich, dark green color. I have observed the same effect\r\nwhere coal-ashes were spread on grass-land; and I have thought that the\r\napparent benefit was due largely to the material acting as a kind of\r\nmulch, rather than to its supplying plant-food to the grass.\r\n\r\n\r\nI doubt very much whether we can afford to make such a compost of earth\r\nwith lime, ashes, or manure in this country. But I feel sure that those\r\nof us having rich clay land containing, in an inert form, as much\r\nnitrogen and phosphoric acid as Dr. Vœlcker found in the soil to be used\r\nin the earth-closet at Wakefield, can well afford to stir it freely, and\r\nexpose it to the disintegrating and decomposing action of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nAn acre of dry soil six inches deep weighs about 1,000 tons; and\r\nconsequently an acre of such soil as we are talking about would contain\r\n6,200 lbs. of nitrogen, and 3,600 lbs. of phosphoric acid. In other\r\nwords, it contains to the depth of only six inches as much nitrogen as\r\nwould be furnished by 775 tons of common barn-yard manure, and as much\r\nphosphoric acid as 900 tons of manure. With such facts as these before\r\nus, am I to blame for urging farmers to cultivate their land more\r\nthoroughly? I do not know that my land or the Deacon’s is as rich as\r\nthis English soil; but, at any rate, I see no reason why such should not\r\nbe the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR BARLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Lawes and Gilbert have published the results of experiments with\r\ndifferent manures on barley grown annually on the same land for twenty\r\nyears in succession. The experiments commenced in 1852.\r\n\r\nThe soil is of the same general character as that in the field on the\r\nsame farm where wheat was grown annually for so many years, and of which\r\nwe have given such a full account. It is what we should call a\r\ncalcareous clay loam. On my farm, we have what the men used to call\r\n“clay spots.” These spots vary in size from two acres down to the tenth\r\nof an acre. They rarely produced even a fair crop of corn or potatoes,\r\nand the barley was seldom worth harvesting. Since I have drained the\r\nland and taken special pains to bestow extra care in plowing and working\r\nthese hard and intractable portions of the fields, the “clay spots” have\r\ndisappeared, and are now nothing more than good, rather stiff, clay\r\nloam, admirably adapted for wheat, barley, and oats, and capable of\r\nproducing good crops of corn, potatoes, and mangel-wurzels.\r\n\r\nThe land on which Mr. Lawes’ wheat and barley experiments were made is\r\nnot dissimilar in general character from these “clay spots.” If the land\r\nwas only half-worked, we should call it clay; but being thoroughly\r\ncultivated, it is a good clay loam. Mr. Lawes describes it as “a\r\nsomewhat heavy loam, with a subsoil of raw, yellowish red clay, but\r\nresting in its turn upon chalk, which provides good natural drainage.”\r\n\r\nThe part of the field devoted to the experiments was divided into 24\r\nplots, about the fifth of an acre each.\r\n\r\nTwo plots were left without manure of any kind.\r\n\r\nOne plot was manured every year with 14 tons per acre of farm-yard\r\nmanure, and the other plots “with manures,” to quote Dr. Gilbert\r\n“which respectively supplied certain constituents of farm-yard manure,\r\nseparately or in combination.”\r\n\r\nIn England, the best barley soils are usually lighter than the best\r\nwheat soils. This is probably due to the fact that barley usually\r\nfollows a crop of turnips--more or less of which are eaten off on the\r\nland by sheep. The trampling of the sheep compresses the soil, and makes\r\neven a light, sandy one firmer in texture.\r\n\r\nIn this country, our best wheat land is also our best barley land,\r\n_provided_ it is in good heart, and is very thoroughly worked. It is no\r\nuse sowing barley on heavy land half worked. It will do better on light\r\nsoils; but if the clayey soils are made fine and mellow, they produce\r\nwith us the best barley.\r\n\r\nIn chemical composition, barley is quite similar to wheat. Mr. Lawes and\r\nDr. Gilbert give the composition of a wheat-crop of 30 bushels per acre,\r\n1,800 lbs. of grain, and 3,000 lbs. of straw; and of a crop of barley,\r\n40 bushels per acre, 2,080 lbs. grain, and 2,500 lbs. of straw, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  ----------------+----------------+----------------+------------------\r\n                  | In Grain.      | In Straw.      | In Total Produce.\r\n                  +-------+--------+-------+--------+----------+-------\r\n                  | Wheat | Barley | Wheat | Barley |  Wheat   | Barley\r\n                  |  lbs. |   lbs. |  lbs. |   lbs. |    lbs.  |   lbs.\r\n  Nitrogen        |  32.  |   33.  |  13.  |   12.  |    45.   |   45.\r\n  Phosphoric acid |  16.  |   17.  |   7.  |    5.  |    23.   |   22.\r\n  Potash          |   9.5 |   11.5 |  20.5 |   18.5 |    30.   |   30.\r\n  Lime            |   1.  |    1.5 |   9.  |   10.5 |    10.   |   12.\r\n  Magnesia        |   3.5 |    4.  |   3.  |    2.5 |     6.5  |    6.5\r\n  Silica          |   0.5 |   12.  |  99.5 |   63.  |   100.   |   75.\r\n  ----------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+----------+-------\r\n\r\nA few years ago, when the midge destroyed our wheat, many farmers in\r\nWestern New York raised “winter barley,” instead of “winter wheat,” and\r\nI have seen remarkably heavy crops of this winter barley. It is not now\r\ngrown with us. The maltsters would not pay as much for it as for spring\r\nbarley, and as the midge troubles us less, our farmers are raising\r\nwinter wheat again.\r\n\r\nWhere, as with us, we raise winter wheat and spring barley, the\r\ndifference between the two crops, taking the above estimate of yield and\r\nproportion of grain to straw, would be:\r\n\r\n1st. Almost identical composition in regard to nitrogen, phosphoric\r\nacid, potash, lime, and magnesia; but as it has more straw, the\r\nwheat-crop removes a larger amount of silica than barley.\r\n\r\n2d. The greatest difference is in the length of time the two crops are\r\nin the ground. We sow our winter wheat the last of August, or the first\r\nand second week in September. Before winter sets in, the wheat-plant\r\noften throws out a bunch of roots a foot in length. During the winter,\r\nthough the thermometer goes down frequently to zero, and sometimes 10°\r\nto 15° below zero, yet if the land is well covered with snow, it is not\r\nimprobable that the roots continue to absorb more or less food from the\r\nground, and store it up for future use. In the spring, the wheat\r\ncommences to grow before we can get the barley into the ground, though\r\nnot to any considerable extent. I have several times sown barley as soon\r\nas the surface-soil was thawed out five or six inches deep, but with a\r\nbed of solid frozen earth beneath.\r\n\r\n3d. Two-rowed barley does not ripen as early as winter wheat, but our\r\nordinary six-rowed barley is ready to harvest the same time as our\r\nwinter wheat.\r\n\r\n4th. We sow our barley usually in May, and harvest it in July. The\r\nbarley, therefore, has to take up its food rapidly. If we expect a good\r\ngrowth, we must provide a good supply of food, and have it in the proper\r\ncondition for the roots to reach it and absorb it; in other words, the\r\nland must be not only rich, but it must be so well worked that the roots\r\ncan spread out easily and rapidly in search of food and water. In this\r\ncountry, you will find ten good wheat-growers to one good barley grower.\r\n\r\n“That is so,” said the Deacon; “but tell us about Mr. Lawes’\r\nexperiments. I have more confidence in them than in your speculations.\r\nAnd first of all what kind of land was the barley grown on?”\r\n\r\n“It is,” said I, “rather heavy land--as heavy as what the men call\r\n‘clay-spots,’ on my farm.”\r\n\r\n“And on those clay-spots,” said the Deacon, “you either get very good\r\nbarley, or a crop not worth harvesting.”\r\n\r\n“You have hit it exactly, Deacon,” said I. “The best barley I have this\r\nyear (1878) is on these clay-spots. And the reason is, that we gave them\r\nan extra plowing last fall with a three-horse plow. That extra plowing\r\nhas probably given me an extra 30 bushels of barley per acre. The barley\r\non some of the lighter portions of the field will not yield over 25\r\nbushels per acre. On the clay-spots, it looks now (June 13) as though\r\nthere would be over 50 bushels per acre. It is all headed out handsomely\r\non the clay-spots, and has a strong, dark, luxuriant appearance, while\r\non the sand, the crop is later and has a yellow, sickly look.”\r\n\r\n“You ought,” said the Doctor, “to have top-dressed these poor, sandy\r\nparts of the field with a little superphosphate and nitrate of soda.”\r\n\r\n“It would have paid wonderfully well,” said I, “or, perhaps, more\r\ncorrectly speaking, the loss would have been considerably less. We have\r\nrecently been advised by a distinguished writer, to apply manure to our\r\nbest land, and let the poor land take care of itself. But where the poor\r\nland is in the same field with the good, we are obliged to plow, harrow,\r\ncultivate, sow, and harvest the poor spots, and the question is, whether\r\nwe shall make them capable of producing a good crop by the application\r\nof manure, or be at all the labor and expense of putting in and\r\nharvesting a crop of chicken-feed and weeds. Artificial manures give us\r\na grand chance to make our crops more uniform.”\r\n\r\n“You are certainly right there,” said the Doctor, “but let us examine\r\nthe Rothamsted experiments on barley.”\r\n\r\nYou will find the results in the following tables. The manures used,\r\nare in many respects the same as were adopted in the wheat experiments\r\nalready given. The mineral or ash constituents were supplied as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Potash_--as sulphate of potash.\r\n  _Soda_--as sulphate of soda.\r\n  _Magnesia_--as sulphate of magnesia.\r\n  _Lime_--as sulphate, phosphate, and superphosphate.\r\n  _Phosphoric acid_--as bone-ash, mixed with sufficient sulphuric\r\n    acid to convert most of the insoluble earthy phosphate of\r\n    lime into sulphate and soluble superphosphate of lime.\r\n  _Sulphuric acid_--in the phosphatic mixture just mentioned; in\r\n    sulphates of potash, soda, and magnesia; in sulphate of ammonia,\r\n    etc.\r\n  _Chlorine_--in muriate of ammonia.\r\n  _Silica_--as artificial silicate of soda.\r\n\r\nOther constituents were supplied as under:\r\n\r\n  _Nitrogen_--as sulphate and muriate of ammonia; as nitrate of\r\n    soda; in farm-yard manure; in rape-cake.\r\n  _Non-nitrogenous organic matter, yielding by decomposition, carbonic\r\n    acid, and other products_--in yard manure, in rape-cake.\r\n\r\nThe artificial manure or mixture for each plot was ground up, or\r\notherwise mixed, with a sufficient quantity of soil and turf-ashes to\r\nmake it up to a convenient measure for equal distribution over the land.\r\nThe mixtures so prepared were, with proper precautions, sown broadcast\r\nby hand; as it has been found that the application of an exact amount of\r\nmanure, to a limited area of land, can be best accomplished in that way.\r\n\r\nThe same manures were used on the same plot each year.

= 41 lbs.\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this 50 lbs. of ammonia alone, on plot 1_a_, gives\r\nan increase of nearly 10 bushels per acre, or to be more accurate, it\r\ngives an increase over the unmanured plot of 503 lbs. of grain, and 329\r\nlbs. of straw, while double the quantity of ammonia on plot 1_a.a._,\r\ngives an increase of 17¼ bushels per acre--or an increase of 901 lbs. of\r\ngrain, and 1,144 lbs. of straw.\r\n\r\n“Put that fact in separate lines, side by side,” said the Deacon, “so\r\nthat we can see it.”\r\n

”   901  ”   1144  ”   2045  ”\r\n  The first 50 lbs. of ammonia gives an\r\n    increase of                            503  ”    704  ”   1207  ”\r\n  The second 50 lbs. of ammonia gives an\r\n    increase of                            398  ”    540  ”    738  ”\r\n\r\n“That shows,” said the Deacon, “that a dressing of 50 lbs. per acre pays\r\nbetter than a dressing of 100 lbs. per acre. I wish Mr. Lawes had sown\r\n75 lbs. on one plot.”\r\n\r\nI wish so, too, but it is quite probable that in our climate, 50 lbs. of\r\navailable ammonia per acre is all that it will usually be profitable to\r\napply per acre to the barley crop. It is equal to a dressing of 500 lbs.\r\nguaranteed Peruvian guano, or 275 lbs. nitrate of soda. --“Or to how\r\nmuch manure?” asked the Deacon.\r\n\r\nTo about 5 tons of average stable-manure, or say three tons of good,\r\nwell-rotted manure from grain-fed animals.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said the Deacon, “Mr. Lawes put on 14 tons of yard manure per\r\nacre, and the yield of barley was not as much as from the 50 lbs. of\r\nammonia alone. How do you account for that?”\r\n\r\nSimply because the ammonia in the manure is _not_ ammonia. It is what\r\nthe chemists used to call “potential ammonia.” A good deal of it is in\r\nthe form of undigested straw and hay. The nitrogenous matter of the food\r\nwhich has been digested by the animal and thrown off in the liquid\r\nexcrements, is in such a form that it will readily ferment and produce\r\nammonia, while the nitrogenous matter in the undigested food and in the\r\nstraw used for bedding, decomposes slowly even under the most favorable\r\nconditions; and if buried while fresh in a clay soil, it probably would\r\nnot all decompose in many years. But we will not discuss this at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n“The superphosphate does not seem to have done much good,” said the\r\nDeacon; “3½ cwt. per acre gives an increase of less than two bushels per\r\nacre. And I suppose it was _good_ superphosphate.”\r\n\r\nThere need be no doubt on that point. Better superphosphate of lime\r\ncannot be made. But you must recollect that this is pure superphosphate\r\nmade from burnt bones. It contains no ammonia or organic matter.\r\nCommercial superphosphates contain more or less ammonia, and had they\r\nbeen used in these experiments, they would have shown a better result\r\nthan the pure article. They would have done good in proportion to the\r\navailable nitrogen they contained. If these experiments prove anything,\r\nthey clearly indicate that superphosphate alone is a very poor manure\r\nfor either wheat or barley.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ year, the unmanured plot gave 25¾ bushels per acre. Potash,\r\nsoda, and magnesia, (or what the Deacon calls “ashes,”) 27⅝ bushels;\r\nsuperphosphate 33½, and “ashes” and superphosphate, nearly 36 bushels\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\n50 lbs. of ammonia, alone, gives nearly 39 bushels, and ammonia and\r\nsuperphosphate together, 40 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe superphosphate and “ashes” give a better account of themselves this\r\nyear; but it is remarkable that the ammonia alone, gives almost as good\r\na crop as the ammonia and superphosphate, and a _better_ crop than the\r\nammonia and “ashes,” or the ammonia, superphosphate, and ashes,\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe 14 tons farm-yard manure gives over 36 bushels per acre. This plot\r\nhas now had 28 tons of manure per acre, yet the 50 lbs. of ammonia\r\nalone, still gives a better yield than this heavy dressing of manure.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ season (1854), was quite favorable for the ripening of wheat\r\nand barley. The seed on the experimental barley-field, was sown Feb. 24,\r\nand the harvest was late; so that the crop had an unusually long season\r\nfor growth. It was one of the years when even poor land, if clean, gives\r\na good crop. The unmanured plot, it will be seen, yielded over 35\r\nbushels per acre of dressed grain, weighing over 53½ lbs. per bushel.\r\nThe total weight of grain, was 1,963 lbs. This is over 40 bushels per\r\nacre, of 48 lbs. per bushel, which is the standard with us.\r\n\r\nThe 14 tons of farm-yard manure produce nearly 56½ bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n   50 lbs. of ammonia, on plot 1_a._    47¾ bushels per acre.\r\n  100  ”   ”    ”      ”    ”  1_a.a._  56⅝      ”        ”\r\n\r\nYou will see, that though the plot which has received 42 tons of manure\r\nper acre, produced a splendid crop; the plot having nothing except 100\r\nlbs. of ammonia per acre, produced a crop equally good. “How much\r\nincrease do you get from 50 lbs. of ammonia,” asked the Deacon, “and how\r\nmuch from 100 lbs.?”\r\n                                                         Equal Amer.\r\n                                 Grain.      Straw.      Bushels.\r\n   50 lbs. of ammonia,\r\n         gives an increase of      800 lbs.    952 lbs.  16⅔ bush.\r\n  100  ”   ”    ”\r\n           ”   ”     ”     ”     1,350  ”    2,100  ”    28      ”\r\n\r\nIf you buy nitrate of soda at 3¾ cents a lb., the ammonia will cost 20\r\ncents a lb. In the above experiment, 50 lbs. of ammonia, costing $10,\r\ngives an increase of 16⅔ bushels of barley, and nearly half a ton of\r\nstraw. If the straw is worth $4.00 per ton, the barley will cost 48\r\ncents a bushel.\r\n\r\nDouble the quantity of manure, costing $20, gives an increase of 28\r\nbushels of barley, and over one ton of straw. In this case the extra\r\nbarley costs 57 cents a bushel.\r\n\r\nOn plot 2_a._, 50 lbs. of ammonia and 3½ cwt. of superphosphate, give\r\n3,437 lbs. of grain, equal to 71½ of our bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nOn plot 2_a.a._, 100 lbs. of ammonia and 3½ cwt. of superphosphate, give\r\n3,643 lbs. of grain, which lacks only 5 lbs. of 76 bushels per acre, and\r\nnearly 2½ tons of straw.\r\n\r\n“That will do,” said the Deacon, “but I see that in 1857, this same\r\nplot, with the same manure, produced 66½ bushels of dressed grain per\r\nacre, weighing 53½ lbs. to the bushel, or a total weight of 3,696 lbs.,\r\nequal to just 77 of our bushels per acre.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said the Doctor, “this same year, the plot which had 84 tons\r\nof farm-yard manure per acre, produced only 2,915 lbs. of grain, or less\r\nthan 61 of our bushels of barley per acre.”\r\n\r\nThe Squire happened in at this time, and heard the last remark. “What\r\nare you saying,” he remarked, “about _only_ 61 bushels of barley per\r\nacre. I should like to see such a crop. Last year, in this neighborhood,\r\nthere were hundreds of acres of barley that did not yield 20 bushels per\r\nacre, and very little of it would weigh 44 lbs. to the bushel.”\r\n\r\nThis is true. And the maltsters find it almost impossible to get\r\nsix-rowed barley weighing 48 lbs. per bushel. They told me, that they\r\nwould pay $1.10 per bushel for good bright barley weighing 48 lbs. per\r\nbushel, and for each pound it weighed less than this, they deducted 10\r\ncents a bushel from the price. In other words, they would pay $1.00 a\r\nbushel for barley weighing 47 lbs. to the bushel; 90 cents for barley\r\nweighing 46 lbs.; 80 cents for barley weighing 45 lbs., and 70 cents for\r\nbarley weighing 44 lbs.--and at these figures they much preferred the\r\nheaviest barley.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly well worth our while, if we raise barley at all, to see\r\nif we cannot manage not only to raise larger crops per acre, but to\r\nproduce barley of better quality. And these wonderful experiments of Mr.\r\nLawes are well worth careful examination and study.\r\n\r\nThe Squire put on his spectacles and looked at the tables of figures.\r\n\r\n“Like everybody else,” said he, “you pick out the big figures, and to\r\nhear you talk, one would think you scientific gentlemen never have any\r\npoor crops, and yet I see that in 1860, there are three different crops\r\nof only 12⅛, 12¼, and 13¼ bushels per acre.”\r\n\r\n“Those,” said I, “are the three plots which have grown barley every year\r\nwithout any manure, and you have selected the worst year of the whole\r\ntwenty.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” said the Squire, “but we have got to take the bad with the\r\ngood, and I have often heard you say that a good farmer who has his land\r\nrich and clean makes more money in an unfavorable than in a favorable\r\nseason. Now, this year 1860, seems to have been an unfavorable one, and\r\nyet your pet manure, superphosphate, only gives an _increase_ of 148\r\nlbs. of barley--or three bushels and 4 lbs. Yet this plot has had a\r\ntremendous dressing of 3½ cwt. of superphosphate yearly since 1852.\r\nI always told you you lost money in buying superphosphate.”\r\n\r\n“That depends on what you do with it. I use it for turnips, and\r\ntomatoes, cabbages, lettuce, melons, cucumbers, etc., and would not like\r\nto be without it; but I have never recommended any one to use it on\r\nwheat, barley, oats, Indian corn, or potatoes, except as an experiment.\r\nWhat I have recommended you to get for barley is, nitrate of soda, and\r\nsuperphosphate, or Peruvian guano. And you will see that even in this\r\ndecidedly unfavorable season, the plot 2_a.a._, dressed with\r\nsuperphosphate and 275 lbs. of nitrate of soda, produced 2,338 lbs. of\r\nbarley, or 48¾ bushels per acre. This is an _increase_ over the\r\nunmanured plots of 33½ bushels per acre, and an _increase_ of 1,872 lbs.\r\nof straw. And the plot dressed with superphosphate and 200 lbs. of salts\r\nof ammonia, gave equally as good results.”\r\n\r\nAnd this, mark you, is the year which the Squire selected as the one\r\nmost likely to show that artificial manures did not pay.\r\n\r\n“I never knew a man except you,” said the Squire, “who wanted\r\nunfavorable seasons.”\r\n\r\nI have never said I wanted unfavorable seasons. I should not dare to say\r\nso, or even to cherish the wish for one moment. But I do say, that when\r\nwe have a season so favorable that even poorly worked land will produce\r\na fair crop, we are almost certain to have prices below the average cost\r\nof production. But when we have an unfavorable season, such crops as\r\nbarley, potatoes, and beans, often advance to extravagantly high prices,\r\nand the farmer who has good crops in such a season, gets something like\r\nadequate pay for his patient waiting, and for his efforts to improve his\r\nland.\r\n\r\n“That sounds all very well,” said the Squire, “but will it pay to use\r\nthese artificial manures?”\r\n\r\nI do not wish to wander too much from the point, but would like to\r\nremark before I answer that question, that I am not a special advocate\r\nof artificial manures. I think we can often make manures on our farms\r\nfar cheaper than we can buy them. But as the Squire has asked the\r\nquestion, and as he has selected from Mr. Lawes’ results, the year 1860,\r\nI will meet him on his own ground. He has selected a season specially\r\nunfavorable for the growth of barley. Now, in such an unfavorable year\r\nin this country, barley would be likely to bring, at least, $1.25 per\r\nbushel, and in a favorable season not over 75 cents a bushel.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawes keeps his land _clean_, which is more than can be said of many\r\nbarley-growers. And in this unfavorable season of 1860, he gets on his\r\nthree unmanured plots an average of 730 lbs. of barley, equal to 15¼\r\nbushels per acre, and not quite 800 lbs. of straw.\r\n\r\nMany of our farmers frequently do no better than this. And you must\r\nrecollect that in such careful experiments as those of Mr. Lawes and Dr.\r\nGilbert, great pains would be taken to get all the barley that grew on\r\nthe land. With us, barley is cut with a reaper, and admirable as our\r\nmachines are, it is not an easy matter to cut a light, spindling crop of\r\nbarley perfectly clean. Then, in pitching the crop and drawing it in,\r\nmore or less barley is scattered, and even after we have been over the\r\nfield two or three times with a steel-tooth rake, there is still\r\nconsiderable barley left on the ground. I think we may safely assume\r\nthat at least as much barley is left on the ground as we usually\r\nsow--say two bushels per acre. And so, instead of having 15¼ bushels per\r\nacre, as Mr. Lawes had, we should only harvest 13¼ bushels.\r\n\r\nOf all our ordinary farm crops, barley is attended with the least labor\r\nand expense. We usually sow it after corn or potatoes. On such strong\r\nland as that of Mr. Lawes, we ought to plow the land in the autumn and\r\nagain in the spring, or at least stir up the land thoroughly with a two\r\nor three-horse cultivator or gang-plow.\r\n\r\nLet us say that the cost of plowing, harrowing, drilling, and rolling,\r\nis $5.00 per acre. Seed, $2.00. Harvesting, $2.00. Threshing, 6 cents a\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nReceipts:\r\n\r\n  13¼ bushels barley @ 1.25                   $16.57\r\n  800 lbs. of straw @ $4. per ton               1.60\r\n                                              ------\r\n  Putting in and harvesting the crop   $9.00\r\n  Threshing 13¼ bushels @ 6c             .80    9.80\r\n                                              ------\r\n  Rent and profit per acre                    $ 8.37\r\n\r\n“That is a better showing than I expected,” said the Squire, “and as\r\nbarley occupies the land only a few months, and as we sow wheat after\r\nit, we cannot expect large profits.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said I, “Now let us take the crop, this same unfavorable\r\nyear, on plot 2_a.a._, dressed with superphosphate and nitrate of soda.”\r\n\r\nThe expense of plowing, harrowing, drilling, rolling, seed, and\r\nharvesting, would be about the same, or we will say $2.00 an acre more\r\nfor extra labor in harvesting. And we will allow two bushels per acre\r\nfor scatterings--though there is nothing like as much barley left on the\r\nground when we have a good crop, as when we have a poor crop. But I want\r\nto be liberal.\r\n\r\nThe yield on plot 2_a.a._, was 48¾ bushels per acre, and 2,715 lbs. of\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\nReceipts:\r\n\r\n  46¾ bushels @ $1.25                            $58.43\r\n  2,715 lbs. straw @ $4. per ton                   5.43\r\n                                                 ------\r\n                                                 $63.86\r\n  Putting in the crop and harvesting    $11.00\r\n  Threshing 46¾ bushels @ 6 c             2.80\r\n  275 lbs. nitrate of soda @ 4 c         11.00\r\n  392 lbs. superphosphate @ 2 c           7.84\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                                 $32.64\r\n                                                 ------\r\n  Rent and profit                                $31.22\r\n\r\nIn ordinary farm practice, I feel sure we can do better than this.\r\nGrowing barley year after year on the same land, is not the most\r\neconomical way of getting the full value of the manure. There is much\r\nnitrogen and phosphoric acid left in the land, which barley or even\r\nwheat does not seem capable of taking up, but which would probably be of\r\ngreat benefit to the clover.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURE AND ROTATION OF CROPS.\r\n\r\nThe old notion that there is any real chemical necessity for a rotation\r\nof crops is unfounded. Wheat can be grown after wheat, and barley after\r\nbarley, and corn after corn, provided we use the necessary manures and\r\nget the soil clean and in the right mechanical condition.\r\n\r\n“What, then, do we gain by a rotation?” asked the Deacon.\r\n\r\nMuch every way. A good rotation enables us to clean the land. We can put\r\nin different crops at different seasons.\r\n\r\n“So we could,” broke in the Deacon, “if we sowed wheat after wheat,\r\nbarley after barley, and corn after corn.”\r\n\r\nTrue, but if we sowed winter-wheat after winter-wheat, there would not\r\nbe time enough to clean the land.\r\n\r\n“Just as much as when we sow wheat after oats, or peas, or barley.”\r\n\r\n“True again, Deacon,” I replied, “but we are supposed to have cleaned\r\nthe land while it was in corn the previous year. I say supposed, because\r\nin point of fact, many of our farmers do not half clean their land while\r\nit is in corn. It is the weak spot in our agriculture. If our land was\r\nas clean as it should be to start with, there is no rotation so\r\nconvenient in this section, as corn the first year, barley, peas, or\r\noats the second year, followed by winter-wheat seeded down. But to carry\r\nout this rotation to the best advantage we need artificial manures.”\r\n\r\n“But will they pay?” asks the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“They will pay well, provided we can get them at a fair price and get\r\nfair prices for our produce. If we could get a good superphosphate made\r\nfrom Charleston phosphates for 1½ cent per lb., and nitrate of soda for\r\n3½ or 4 cents per lb., and the German potash-salts for ¾ cent per lb.,\r\nand could get on the average $1.25 per bushel for barley, and $1.75 for\r\ngood white wheat, we could use these manures to great advantage.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing like barn-yard manure,” says the Deacon.\r\n\r\nNo doubt on that point, provided it is good manure. Barn-yard manure,\r\nwhether rich or poor, contains all the elements of plant-food, but there\r\nis a great difference between rich and poor manure. The rich manure\r\ncontains twice or three times as much nitrogen and phosphoric acid as\r\nordinary or poor manure. And this is the reason why artificial manures\r\nare valuable in proportion to the nitrogen and phosphoric acid that they\r\ncontain in an available condition. When we use two or three hundred\r\npounds per acre of a good artificial manure we in effect, directly or\r\nindirectly, convert poor manure into rich manure. There is manure in our\r\nsoil, but it is poor. There is manure in our barn-yard, but it is poor\r\nalso. Nitrogen and phosphoric acid will make these manures rich. This is\r\nthe reason why a few pounds of a good artificial manure will produce as\r\ngreat an effect as tons of common manure. Depend upon it, the coming\r\nfarmer will avail himself of the discoveries of science, and will use\r\nmore artificial fertilizers.\r\n\r\nBut whether we use artificial fertilizers or farm-yard manure, we shall\r\nnot get the full effect of the manures unless we adopt a judicious\r\nrotation of crops.\r\n\r\nWhen we sow wheat after wheat, or barley after barley, or oats after\r\noats, we certainly do not get the full effect of the manures used. Mr.\r\nLawes’ experiments afford conclusive evidence on this point. You will\r\nrecollect that in 1846, one of the plots of wheat (10_b_), which had\r\nreceived a liberal dressing of salts of ammonia the year previous, was\r\nleft without manure, and the yield of wheat on this plot was no greater\r\nthan on the plot which was continuously unmanured. In other words, _the\r\nammonia which was left in the soil from the previous year, had no effect\r\non the wheat_.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the amount of nitrogen furnished by the\r\nmanure, and the amount recovered in the crop, when wheat is grown after\r\nwheat for a series of years, and also when barley is grown after barley,\r\nand oats after oats.\r\n\r\n  Table Showing the Amount of Nitrogen Recovered, and Not Recovered, in\r\n  Increase of Produce, for 100 Supplied in Manure.\r\n\r\n  ----+-----------------------------------------+---------------------\r\n      |                                         |  For 100 Nitrogen\r\n   P  |                                         |     in Manure\r\n   l  |    Manures Per Acre, Per Annum.         +----------+----------\r\n   o  |                                         |Recovered |Not Rec’d\r\n   t  |                                         |  in      |  in\r\n   s  |                                         |Increase. |Increase.\r\n  ----+-----------------------------------------+----------+----------\r\n         Wheat--20 Years, 1852-1871.\r\n  ----+-----------------------------------------+----------+----------\r\n   6  |Mixed Mineral Manure and 200 lbs.        |          |\r\n      |    Ammonia-salts (=  41 lbs.

It speaks for\r\nitself; but it does not tell half the story. For instance, in the case\r\nof wheat and barley, it gives the average result for 20 years. It shows\r\nthat when 100 lbs. of nitrogen in a soluble and available form, are\r\napplied to wheat, about 68 lbs. are _left in the soil_. But you must\r\nrecollect that 100 lbs. was applied again the next year, and no account\r\nis taken of the 68 lbs. left in the soil--and so on for 20 years. In\r\nother words, on plot 8, for instance, 2,460 lbs. of nitrogen have been\r\napplied, and only 775 lbs. have been recovered in the total produce of\r\ngrain, straw, and chaff, and 1,685 lbs. have been left in the soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawes estimates, from several analyses, that his farm-yard manure\r\ncontains 0.637 per cent of nitrogen, 2.76 per cent of mineral matter,\r\nand 27.24 per cent of organic matter, and 70 per cent of water.\r\n\r\nAccording to this, the plot dressed with 14 tons of manure every year,\r\nfor 20 years, has received 3,995 lbs. of nitrogen, of which 583¼ lbs.\r\nwere recovered in the produce, and 3,411¾ lbs. were left in the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the case of barley, 3,995 lbs. of nitrogen was applied during the 20\r\nyears to the plot dressed with farm-yard manure, of which 427½ lbs. were\r\nrecovered in the crop, and 3,567½ lbs. left in the soil.\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the Deacon, “that barley gets less of the goodness out of\r\nfarm-yard manure than wheat, but that it gets more out of the salts of\r\nammonia and nitrate of soda. How do you account for that?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose, because the manure for wheat was applied in the autumn, and\r\nthe rains of winter and spring dissolved more of the plant-food than\r\nwould be the case if the manure was applied in the spring. If the manure\r\nhad been applied on the surface, instead of plowing it under, I believe\r\nthe effect would have been still more in favor of the autumn-manuring.”\r\n\r\nWhen the nitrogen is in an available condition, spring barley can take\r\nup and utilize a larger proportion of the nitrogen than winter wheat.\r\nNeither the wheat nor the barley can get at and take up half what is\r\napplied, and this, notwithstanding the fact that a heavy dew or a slight\r\nrain furnishes water enough on an acre to dissolve a liberal dressing of\r\nnitrate of soda or sulphate and muriate of ammonia. The truth is, the\r\nsoil is very conservative. It does not, fortunately for us, yield up all\r\nits plant-food in a year.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that when wheat or barley is dressed with soluble\r\nammonia-salts or nitrate of soda, a considerable amount of the nitrogen\r\nis left in the soil--and yet this nitrogen is of comparatively little\r\nbenefit to the succeeding crops of wheat or barley, while a fresh\r\ndressing of ammonia-salts or nitrate of soda is of great benefit to the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nIn other words, when wheat is sown after wheat, or barley after barley,\r\nwe do not get half the benefit from the manure which it is theoretically\r\ncapable of producing.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, the question is, whether by a judicious rotation of crops, we can\r\navoid this great loss of manure?\r\n\r\nThere was a time when it was thought that the growth of turnips enriched\r\nthe soil. I have heard it said, again and again, that the reason English\r\nfarmers grow larger crops of wheat and barley than we do, is because\r\nthey grow so many acres of turnips.\r\n\r\n“So I have often heard,” said the Deacon, “and I supposed the broad\r\nturnip leaves absorbed nitrogen from the atmosphere.”\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that leaves have any such power; while there are\r\nmany facts which point in an opposite direction. The following\r\nexperiments of Lawes and Gilbert seem to show that the mere growth of\r\nturnips does not enrich land for grain crops.\r\n\r\nTurnips were grown on the same land, year after year, for ten years. The\r\nland was then plowed and sown to barley for three years. The following\r\ntable gives the results:\r\n\r\n  Three Years of Barley After Ten Years of Turnips.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------+----------------------------\r\n                                      |Produce of Barley per Acre.\r\n  Particulars of Manures, etc.        +------+------+------+-------\r\n                                      | 1853.| 1854.| 1855.|Average\r\n                                      |      |      |      |3 years\r\n  ------------------------------------+------+------+------+-------\r\n                                      | bush.| bush.| bush.|  bush.\r\n  Hoos-Field--                        |      |      |      |\r\n    Barley, without manure, after 3   | 26   | 35⅛  | 34⅛  | 31⅜\r\n      corn-crops                      |      |      |      |\r\n  Barn-Field--                        |      |      |      |\r\n    Barley, after 10 yrs.

In other words, the turnips leave _less_ available nitrogen in\r\nthe soil than grain crops.\r\n\r\nAfter alluding to the facts given in the foregoing table, Messrs. Lawes\r\nand Gilbert say:\r\n\r\n“There is evidence of another kind that may be cited as showing that it\r\nwas of available nitrogen that the turnips had rendered the soil so\r\ndeficient for the after-growth of barley. It may be assumed that, on the\r\naverage, between 25 and 30 lbs. of nitrogen would be annually removed\r\nfrom the Rothamsted soil by wheat or barley grown year after year\r\nwithout nitrogenous manure. But it is estimated that from the\r\nmineral-manured turnip-plots there were, over the 10 years, more than 50\r\nlbs. of nitrogen per acre per annum removed. As, however, on some of the\r\nplots, small quantities of ammonia-salts or rape-cake were applied in\r\nthe first two years of the ten of turnips, it is, perhaps, more to the\r\npurpose to take the average over the last 8 years of turnips only; and\r\nthis would show about 45 lbs. of nitrogen removed per acre per annum. An\r\nimmaterial proportion of this might be due to the small amounts of\r\nnitrogenous manures applied in the first two years. Still, it may be\r\nassumed that about 1½ time as much nitrogen was removed from the land\r\nfor 8, if not for 10 years, in succession, as would have been taken in\r\nan equal number of crops of wheat or barley grown without nitrogenous\r\nmanure. No wonder, then, that considerably less barley has been grown in\r\n3 years after a series of mineral-manured turnip-crops, than was\r\nobtained in another field after a less number of corn-crops.\r\n\r\n“The results obtained in Barn-field afford a striking illustration of\r\nthe dependence of the turnip-plant on a supply of available nitrogen\r\nwithin the soil, and of its comparatively great power of exhausting it.\r\nThey are also perfectly consistent with those in Hoos-field, in showing\r\nthat mineral manures will not yield fair crops of barley, unless there\r\nbe, within the soil, a liberal supply of available nitrogen. The results\r\nobtained under such very different conditions in the two fields are, in\r\nfact, strikingly mutually confirmatory.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR OATS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What is the use of talking about manure for oats,” said the Deacon,\r\n“if land is not rich enough to produce oats without manure, it certainly\r\nwill not pay to manure them. We can use our manure on some crop that\r\nwill pay better.”\r\n\r\n“That is precisely what we want to know,” said I. “Very likely you are\r\nright, but have you any evidence?”\r\n\r\n“Evidence of what?”\r\n\r\n“Have you any facts that show, for instance, that it will pay better to\r\nuse manure for wheat or barley than for oats?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t say that I have, but I think manure will pay better on wheat than\r\non oats.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lawes is making a series of experiments on oats. Let us take a hasty\r\nglance at the results of the first two seasons:\r\n\r\n  Experiments on Oats at Rothamsted.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n                              | Grain, in |  Straw,   |Weight per\r\n                              | bushels.  |   cwts.   |bushel, lbs.\r\n       Manures per Acre.      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n                              | 1869| 1870| 1869| 1870| 1869| 1870\r\n  ----------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n  1.--No manure               | 36⅝ | 16⅜ | 19¼ | 9⅛  | 36¾ | 35\r\n  2.--Mixed Alkalies and      |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n      Superphosphate of Lime  | 45  | 19⅛ | 24½ | 9⅝  | 38½ | 35⅛\r\n  3.--400 lbs.

Nitrate of Soda    | 69⅜ | 50  | 49⅞ | 28¾ | 38½ | 35¾\r\n  ----------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that, for oats, as for barley and wheat, what we most\r\nneed in manure, is available nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe first year, the no-manure plot produced 36⅝ bushels of oats per\r\nacre, weighing 36¾ lbs. per bushel, and plot 3, with ammonia-salts\r\nalone, 56⅛ bushels, and with nitrate of soda alone, on plot 5, 62¼\r\nbushels per acre, both weighing 38½ lbs. per bushel. In other words, 82\r\nlbs. of available nitrogen in the salts of ammonia gave an increase of\r\nabout 20 bushels per acre, and the same quantity of nitrogen in nitrate\r\nof soda an increase of 26 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nThe next year, the season seems to have been a very unfavorable one for\r\noats. The no-manure plot produced less than 17 bushels per acre; and the\r\n“ashes” and superphosphate on plot 2, give an increase of less than 3\r\nbushels per acre. But it will be seen that on plot 3 the ammonia-salts\r\ndo as much good in this unfavorable season as in the favorable one. They\r\ngive an increase of over 20 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n“A few such facts as this,” said the Deacon, “would almost persuade me\r\nthat you are right in contending that it is in the unfavorable seasons,\r\nwhen prices are sure to be high in this country, that a good farmer\r\nstands the best chance to make money.”\r\n\r\n“Where mixed alkalies and superphosphate,” said the Doctor, “are added\r\nto the ammonia, the increase _from the ammonia_ is far greater than\r\nwhere ammonia is used alone. In other words, by comparing plot 2 and\r\nplot 4, you will see that the ammonia gives an increase of 30¼ bushels\r\nper acre in 1869, and 31½ bushels in 1870.”\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter probably is this: 100 lbs. of available ammonia\r\nper acre is an excessive supply, when used alone. And in fact Mr. Lawes\r\nhimself only recommends about half this quantity.\r\n\r\nWhether it will pay us to use artificial manures on oats depends on the\r\nprice we are likely to get for the oats. When the price of oats _per\r\nlb._ and oat-straw is as high as barley and barley-straw _per lb._, then\r\nit will pay a _little better_ to use manure on oats than on barley. As a\r\nrule in this country, however, good barley is worth more per lb. than\r\ngood oats; and it will usually pay better to use artificial manures on\r\nbarley than on oats.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Mr. Bath, of Virginia, made some experiments on oats with\r\nthe following results:\r\n                                   Bushels of oats\r\n                                     per acre.\r\n  No. 1--200 lbs. Superphosphate        22\r\n  No. 2--200 lbs. Peruvian guano        48¾\r\n  No. 3--100 lbs. Peruvian guano        32\r\n\r\nThe oats were sown March 13, and the crop harvested July 4.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, I made some experiments with gypsum, superphosphate, and\r\nsulphate of ammonia as a top-dressing on oats.\r\n\r\nThe land was a clover-sod, plowed about the middle of May, and the oats\r\nsown May 20. On the 26th of May, just as the oats were coming up, the\r\nmanures were sown broadcast. The oats were sown too late to obtain the\r\nbest results. On another field, where the oats were sown two weeks\r\nearlier, the crop was decidedly better. The oats were cut August 28.\r\n\r\nThe following is the result:\r\n\r\nExperiments on Oats at Moreton Farm, Rochester, N.Y.\r\n\r\n  ------+----------------------------------+--------+-------+--------\r\n        |                                  |Bushels |Weight/| Straw\r\n  Plots.|        Manures per Acre.         |of Oats/|Bushel |per acre\r\n        |                                  |acre.   |in lbs.| in lbs.\r\n  ------+----------------------------------+--------+-------+--------\r\n  No. 1 |No manure                         |   36   |  22   |  1,958\r\n      2 |600 lbs.

To\r\ntop-dress foul land with expensive artificial manures is money thrown\r\naway. If the land had been plowed in the autumn, and the seed and\r\nmanures could have been put in early in the spring, I presume we should\r\nhave had more favorable results.\r\n\r\n“Are you not ashamed to acknowledge,” said the Deacon, “that you have\r\never raised oats weighing only 22 lbs. per bushel.”\r\n\r\nNo. I have raised even worse crops than this--and so has the Deacon. But\r\nI made up my mind that such farming did not pay, and I have been trying\r\nhard since then to clean my land and get it into better condition. And\r\nuntil this is done, it is useless to talk much of artificial manures.\r\n\r\nThe most striking result is the effect of the gypsum. It not only\r\ngave an increased yield of 11 bushels per acre, but the oats were of\r\ndecidedly better quality, and there was nearly half a ton more straw per\r\nacre than on the plot alongside, where no manure was used.\r\n\r\nThe superphosphate was a good article, similar to that used in Mr.\r\nLawes’ experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR POTATOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time ago, a farmer in Pennsylvania wrote me that he wanted “to\r\nraise a first-rate crop of potatoes.” I answered him as follows through\r\nthe _American Agriculturist_:\r\n\r\n“There are many ways of doing this. But as you only enter on the farm\r\nthis spring, you will work to disadvantage. To obtain the best results,\r\nit is necessary to prepare for the crop two or three years beforehand.\r\nAll that you can do this year is to select the best land on the farm,\r\nput on 400 lbs. of Peruvian guano, cultivate thoroughly, and suffer not\r\na weed to grow. A two or three-year-old clover-sod, on warm, rich, sandy\r\nloam, gives a good chance for potatoes. Do not plow until you are ready\r\nto plant. Sow the guano broadcast after plowing, and harrow it in, or\r\napply a tablespoonful in each hill, and mix it with the soil. Mark out\r\nthe rows, both ways, three feet apart, and drop a fair-sized potato in\r\neach hill. Start the cultivator as soon as the rows can be\r\ndistinguished, and repeat every week or ten days until there is danger\r\nof disturbing the roots. We usually hill up a little, making a broad,\r\nflat hill. A tablespoonful of plaster, dusted on the young plants soon\r\nafter they come up, will usually do good. We recommend guano, because in\r\nour experience it does not increase the rot. But it is only fair to add,\r\nthat we have not found even barn-yard manure, if thoroughly rotted and\r\nwell mixed with the soil the fall previous, half so injurious as some\r\npeople would have us suppose. If any one will put 25 loads per acre on\r\nour potato land, we will agree to plant and run the risk of the rot. But\r\nwe would use some guano as well. The truth is, that it is useless to\r\nexpect a large crop of potatoes, say 350 bushels per acre, without\r\nplenty of manure.”\r\n\r\nThis was written before the potato-beetle made its appearance. But I\r\nthink I should say the same thing now--only put it a little stronger.\r\nThe truth is, it will not pay to “fight the bugs” on a poor crop of\r\npotatoes. We must select the best land we have and make it as rich as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n“But why do you recommend Peruvian guano,” asked the Doctor, “rather\r\nthan superphosphate or ashes? Potatoes contain a large amount of potash,\r\nand one would expect considerable benefit from an application of ashes.”\r\n\r\n“Ashes, plaster, and hen-dung,” said the Judge, “will at any rate pay\r\nwell on potatoes. I have tried this mixture again and again, and always\r\nwith good effect.”\r\n\r\n“I believe in the hen-dung,” said I, “and possibly in the plaster, but\r\non my land, ashes do not seem to be specially beneficial on potatoes,\r\nwhile I have rarely used Peruvian guano without good effect; and\r\nsometimes it has proved wonderfully profitable, owing to the high price\r\nof potatoes.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSometime ago, I had a visit from one of the most enterprising and\r\nsuccessful farmers in Western New York.\r\n\r\n“What I want to learn,” he said, “is how to make manure enough to keep\r\nmy land in good condition. I sell nothing but beans, potatoes, wheat,\r\nand apples. I feed out all my corn, oats, stalks, straw, and hay on the\r\nfarm, and draw into the barn-yard the potato-vines and everything else\r\nthat will rot into manure. I make a big pile of it. But the point with\r\nme is to find out what is the best stock to feed this straw, stalks,\r\nhay, oats, and corn to, so as to make the best manure and return the\r\nlargest profit. Last year I bought a lot of steers to feed in winter,\r\nand lost money. This fall I bought 68 head of cows to winter, intending\r\nto sell them in the spring.”\r\n\r\n“What did they cost you?”\r\n\r\n“I went into Wyoming and Cattaraugus Counties, and picked them up among\r\nthe dairy farmers, and selected a very fair lot of cows at an average of\r\n$22 per head. I expect to sell them as new milch cows in the spring.\r\nSuch cows last spring would have been worth $60 to $70 each.”\r\n\r\n“That will pay. But it is not often the grain-grower gets such a chance\r\nto feed out his straw, stalks, and other fodder to advantage. It cannot\r\nbe adopted as a permanent system. It is bad for the dairyman, and no\r\nreal help to the grain-grower. The manure is not rich enough. Straw and\r\nstalks alone can not be fed to advantage. And when you winter cows to\r\nsell again in the spring, it will not pay to feed grain. If you were\r\ngoing to keep the cows it would pay well. The fat and flesh you put on\r\nin the winter would be returned in the form of butter and cheese next\r\nsummer.”\r\n\r\n“Why is not the manure good? I am careful to save everything, and expect\r\nseven or eight hundred loads of manure in the spring.”\r\n\r\n“You had 60 acres of wheat that yielded 25 bushels per acre, and have\r\nprobably about 50 tons of wheat straw. You had also 30 acres oats, that\r\nyielded 50 bushels per acre, say 35 tons of straw. Your 20 acres of corn\r\nproduced 40 bushels of shelled corn per acre; say the stalks weigh 30\r\ntons. And you have 60 tons of hay, half clover and half timothy. Let us\r\nsee what your manure from this amount of grain and fodder is worth.\r\n\r\n  Manures from\r\n          50 tons wheat-straw, @ $2.68          $ 134.00\r\n          35 tons oat-straw, @ $2.90              101.50\r\n          30 tons corn-stalks, @ $3.58            107.40\r\n          30 tons timothy-hay, @ $6.43            192.90\r\n          30 tons clover-hay, @ $9.64             289.20\r\n          14 tons oats (1,500 bush.), @ $7.70     107.80\r\n          24 tons corn (800 bushels), @ $6.65     159.60\r\n                                               ---------\r\n  Total  213 tons                              $1,092.40\r\n\r\n“This is the value of the manure _on the land_. Assuming that there are\r\n600 loads, and that the labor of cleaning out the stables, piling,\r\ncarting, and spreading the manure is worth 30 cents per load, or $180,\r\nwe have $912.40 as the net value of the manure.\r\n\r\n“Now, your 250-acre farm _might_ be so managed that this amount of\r\nmanure annually applied would soon greatly increase its fertility. But\r\nyou do not think you can afford to summer-fallow, and you want to raise\r\nthirty or forty acres of potatoes every year.”\r\n\r\n“I propose to do so,” he replied. “Situated as I am, close to a good\r\nshipping station, no crop pays me better. My potatoes this year have\r\naveraged me over $100 per acre.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. But it is perfectly clear to my mind that sooner or later,\r\nyou must either farm slower or feed higher. And in your case, situated\r\nclose to a village where you can get plenty of help, and with a good\r\nshipping station near by, you had better adopt the latter plan. You must\r\nfeed higher, and make richer manure. You now feed out 213 tons of stuff,\r\nand make 600 loads of manure, worth $912.40. By feeding out _one third_,\r\nor 71 tons more, you can _more than double_ the value of the manure.\r\n\r\n  50 tons of bran or mill-feed would give manure worth    $ 729.50\r\n  21 tons decorticated cotton-seed cake                     585.06\r\n                                                         ---------\r\n                                                         $1,314.56\r\n\r\n“Buy and feed out this amount of bran and cake, and you would have 800\r\nloads of manure, worth _on the land_ $2,226.96, or, estimating as before\r\nthat it cost 30 cents a load to handle it, its net value would be\r\n$1,986.96.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI am well aware that comparatively few farmers in this section can\r\nafford to adopt this plan of enriching their land. We want better stock.\r\nI do not know where I could buy a lot of steers that it would pay to\r\nfatten in the winter. Those farmers who raise good grade Shorthorn or\r\nDevon cattle are not the men to sell them half-fat at low rates. They\r\ncan fatten them as well as I can. For some time to come, the farmer who\r\nproposes to feed liberally, will have to raise his own stock. He can\r\nrarely buy well-bred animals to fatten. A good farmer must be a good\r\nfarmer throughout. He can not be good in spots. His land must be\r\ndrained, well-worked, and free from weeds. If he crops heavily he must\r\nmanure heavily, and to do this he must feed liberally--and he can not\r\nafford to feed liberally unless he has good stock.\r\n\r\n“I have, myself, no doubt but you are right on this point,” said the\r\nDoctor, “but all this _takes time_. Suppose a farmer becomes satisfied\r\nthat the manure he makes is not rich enough. To tell him, when he is\r\nanxious to raise a good crop of potatoes next year, that he must go to\r\nwork and improve his stock of cattle, sheep, and swine, and then buy\r\nbran and oil-cake to make richer manure, is somewhat tantalizing.”\r\n\r\nThis is true, and in such a case, instead of adding nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid to his manure in the shape of bran, oil-cake, etc., he\r\ncan buy nitrogen and phosphoric acid in guano or in nitrate of soda and\r\nsuperphosphate. This gives him richer manure; which is precisely what he\r\nwants for his potatoes. His poor manure is not so much deficient in\r\npotash as in nitrogen and phosphoric acid, and consequently it is\r\nnitrogen and phosphoric acid that he will probably need to make his soil\r\ncapable of producing a large crop of potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have seen Peruvian guano extensively used on potatoes, and almost\r\nalways with good effect. My first experience with it in this country,\r\nwas in 1852. Four acres of potatoes were planted on a two-year-old\r\nclover-sod, plowed in the spring. On two acres, Peruvian guano was sown\r\nbroadcast at the rate of 300 lbs. per acre and harrowed in. The potatoes\r\nwere planted May 10. On the other two acres no manure of any kind was\r\nused, though treated exactly alike in every other respect. The result\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n  No manure                    119 bushels per acre.\r\n  300 lbs. Peruvian guano      205   ”         ”\r\n\r\nThe guano cost, here, about 3 cents a lb., and consequently nine\r\ndollars’ worth of guano gave 84 bushels of potatoes. The potatoes were\r\nall sound and good, but where the guano was used, they were larger, with\r\nscarcely a small one amongst them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1857, I made the following experiments on potatoes, in the same field\r\non which the preceding experiment was made in 1852.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as before, the land was a two-year-old clover-sod. It was\r\nplowed about the first of May, and harrowed until it was in a good\r\nmellow condition. The potatoes were planted in hills 3½ feet apart each\r\nway. The following table shows the manures used and the yield of\r\npotatoes per acre.\r\n\r\n  Experiments on Potatoes at Moreton Farm.\r\n\r\n  P.

It was a purely mineral article, free\r\nfrom ammonia and other organic matter. It cost about two and a half\r\ncents per pound.\r\n\r\nThe manures were deposited in the hill, covered with an inch or two of\r\nsoil, and the seed then planted on the top. Where superphosphate of lime\r\nor sulphate of ammonia was used in conjunction with ashes, the ashes\r\nwere first deposited in the hill and covered with a little soil, and\r\nthen the superphosphate or sulphate of ammonia placed on the top and\r\ncovered with soil before the seed was planted. Notwithstanding this\r\nprecaution, the rain washed the sulphate of ammonia into the ashes, and\r\ndecomposition, with loss of ammonia, was the result. This will account\r\nfor the less yield on plot 8 than on plot 2. It would have been better\r\nto have sown the ashes broadcast, but some previous experiments with\r\nPeruvian guano on potatoes indicated that it was best to apply guano in\r\nthe hill, carefully covering it with soil to prevent it injuring the\r\nseed, than to sow it broadcast. It was for this reason, and for the\r\ngreater convenience in sowing, that the manures were applied in the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nThe ash of potatoes consists of about 50 per cent of potash, and this\r\nfact has induced many writers to recommend ashes as a manure for this\r\ncrop. It will be seen, however, that in this instance, at least, they\r\nhave very little effect, 400 lbs. giving an increase of only five\r\nbushels per acre. One hundred pounds of plaster per acre gave an\r\nincrease of six bushels. Plaster and ashes combined, an increase per\r\nacre of 15 bushels.\r\n\r\nOne fact is clearly brought out by these experiments: that this soil,\r\nwhich has been under cultivation without manure for many years, is not,\r\nrelatively to other constituents of crops, deficient in potash. Had such\r\nbeen the case, the sulphate of ammonia and superphosphate of\r\nlime--manures which contain no potash--would not have give a an increase\r\nof 84 bushels of potatoes per acre. There was sufficient potash in the\r\nsoil, in an available condition, for 179 bushels of potatoes per acre;\r\nand the reason why the soil without manure produced only 95 bushels per\r\nacre, was owing to a deficiency of ammonia and phosphates.\r\n\r\nSince these experiments were made, Dr. Vœlcker and others have made\r\nsimilar ones in England. The results on the whole all point in one\r\ndirection. They show that the manures most valuable for potatoes are\r\nthose rich in nitrogen and phosphoric acid, and that occasionally potash\r\nis also a useful addition.\r\n\r\n“There is one thing I should like to know,” said the Doctor. “Admitting\r\nthat nitrogen and phosphoric acid and potash are the most important\r\nelements of plant-food, how many bushels of potatoes should we be likely\r\nto get from a judicious application of these manures?”\r\n\r\n“There is no way,” said I, “of getting at this with any degree of\r\ncertainty. The numerous experiments that have been made in England seem\r\nto show that a given quantity of manure will produce a larger _increase_\r\non poor land than on land in better condition.”\r\n\r\nIn England potatoes are rarely if ever planted without manure, and the\r\nland selected for this crop, even without manure, would usually be in\r\nbetter condition than the average potato land of this section, and\r\nconsequently a given amount of manure, applied to potatoes here, would\r\nbe likely to do more good, up to a certain point, than the same amount\r\nwould in England.\r\n\r\nLet us look at some of the experiments that have been made in England:--\r\n\r\nIn the Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland\r\nfor 1873 is a prize essay on “Experiments upon Potatoes, with Potash\r\nSalts, on Light Land,” by Charles D. Hunter, F.C.S., made on the farm of\r\nWilliam Lawson, in Cumberland. Mr. Hunter “was charged with the manuring\r\nof the farm and the purchasing of chemical manures to the annual value\r\nof £2,000,” or say $10,000.\r\n\r\n“Potatoes,” says Mr. Hunter, “were largely grown on the farm, and in the\r\nabsence of a sufficiency of farm-yard manure, potash naturally suggested\r\nitself as a necessary constituent of a chemical potato-manure. The soil\r\nwas light and gravelly, with an open subsoil, and the rainfall from 29\r\nto 38 inches a year.”\r\n\r\nThe first series of experiments was made in 1867. The following are some\r\nof the results:--\r\n                                     Bushels per acre.\r\n  No manure                            221\r\n  4 cwt. mineral superphosphate        225\r\n  4 cwt. mineral superphosphate and  } 240\r\n  4 cwt. of muriate of potash        }\r\n  15½ tons farm-yard manure            293\r\n\r\n“That does not say much for potash and superphosphate,” said the Deacon.\r\n“The superphosphate only produced four bushels more than the no manure,\r\nand the potash and superphosphate only fifteen bushels more than the\r\nsuperphosphate alone.”\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while mentioning that one of the experimental plots this\r\nyear was on a head-land, “where the cattle frequently stand for\r\nshelter.” This plot was dressed with only eight and a half tons of\r\nmanure, and the crop was over 427 bushels per acre, while a plot\r\nalongside, without manure, produced only 163 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n“That shows the importance,” said the Deacon, “of planting potatoes on\r\nrich land, rather than to plant on poor land and try to make it rich by\r\napplying manure directly to the crop.”\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the results in 1868:\r\n\r\n                                  Bushels per acre.\r\n  1.  No manure                     232\r\n     {4 cwt. superphosphate       }\r\n  2. {2  ”   muriate of potash    } 340\r\n     {2  ”   sulphate of ammonia  }\r\n  3. 20 tons farm-yard manure       342\r\n  4. {4 cwt. superphosphate       } 274\r\n     {4  ”   muriate of potash    }\r\n\r\n“Here again,” said the Doctor, “superphosphate and potash alone give an\r\nincrease of only forty-two bushels per acre, while on plot 2, where two\r\nhundred weight of muriate of potash is substituted by two hundred weight\r\nof sulphate of ammonia, the increase is 108 bushels per acre. It\r\ncertainly looks as though a manure for potatoes, so far as yield is\r\nconcerned, should be rich in available nitrogen.”\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the results in 1869:\r\n\r\n                                   Bushels per acre.\r\n  1.  No manure                      176\r\n\r\n  2. {4 cwt. superphosphate        }\r\n     {¾  ”   sulphate of magnesia  } 306\r\n     {2  ”   muriate of potash     }\r\n     {2  ”   sulphate of ammonia   }\r\n\r\n  3.  4 cwt. superphosphate          189\r\n\r\n  4. {4 cwt. superphosphate        } 201\r\n     {2  ”   sulphate of ammonia   }\r\n\r\n  5. {4 cwt. superphosphate        }\r\n     {2  ”   muriate of potash     } 340\r\n     {2  ”   sulphate of ammonia.  }\r\n\r\n  6. {4 cwt. superphosphate        } 249\r\n     {2  ”   muriate of potash     }\r\n\r\n“This is a very interesting experiment,” said the Doctor.\r\n“Superphosphate alone gives an increase of thirteen bushels.\r\nSuperphosphate and potash an increase of seventy-three bushels. The\r\npotash, therefore, gives an increase of sixty bushels. Superphosphate\r\n_and_ ammonia give twelve bushels more than superphosphate alone, and\r\nthe reason it does not produce a better crop is owing to a deficiency of\r\npotash. When this is supplied the ammonia gives an increase (plots 5 and\r\n6) of ninety-one bushels per acre.”\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the above experiments were repeated on the same land, with the\r\nsame general results.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 some experiments were made on a sharp, gravelly soil, which had\r\nbeen over-cropped, and was in poor condition. The following are the\r\nresults:--\r\n\r\n                                    Bushels per acre.\r\n  1. {9  cwt. superphosphate       } 186\r\n     {3   ”   sulphate of ammonia  }\r\n\r\n  2. {9  cwt. superphosphate       }\r\n     {3½  ”   muriate of potash    } 204\r\n     {3   ”   sulphate of ammonia  }\r\n\r\n  3.

In 1869\r\nit was sown for hay, and in 1870 was broken up and sown to oats, and the\r\nnext spring planted with potatoes. The following are some of the\r\nresults:\r\n\r\n                                   Bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n     {6¼ cwt. superphosphate       }\r\n  1. {2½  ”   muriate of potash    } 321\r\n     {2½  ”   sulphate of ammonia  }\r\n\r\n  2. {6¼ cwt. superphosphate       } 296\r\n     {2½  ”   sulphate of ammonia  }\r\n\r\n  3.  No manure                      252\r\n\r\n  4. {6¼ cwt. superphosphate       } 311\r\n     {2½  ”   muriate of potash    }\r\n\r\n  5.  2½ cwt. sulphate of ammonia    238\r\n\r\n  6.  15 tons farm-yard manure       365\r\n\r\n“It is curious,” said the Doctor, “that the plot with sulphate of\r\nammonia alone should produce less than the no-manure plot.”\r\n\r\n“The sulphate of ammonia,” said I, “may have injured the seed, or it may\r\nhave produced too luxuriant a growth of vine.”\r\n\r\nAnother series of experiments was made on another portion of the same\r\nfield in 1871. The “no-manure” plot produced 337 bushels per acre.\r\nManures of various kinds were used, but the largest yield, 351 bushels\r\nper acre, was from superphosphate and sulphate of ammonia; fourteen tons\r\nbarn-yard manure produce 340 bushels per acre; and Mr. Hunter remarks:\r\n“It is evident that, when the produce of the unmanured soil reaches nine\r\ntons [336 bushels] per acre, there is but little scope for manure of any\r\nkind.”\r\n\r\n“I do not see,” said the Doctor, “that you have answered my question,\r\nbut I suppose that, with potatoes at fifty cents a bushel, and wheat at\r\n$1.50 per bushel, artificial manures can be more profitably used on\r\npotatoes than on wheat, and the same is probably true of oats, barley,\r\ncorn, etc.”\r\n\r\nI have long been of the opinion that artificial manures can be applied\r\nto potatoes with more profit than to any other ordinary farm-crop, for\r\nthe simple reason that, in this country, potatoes, on the average,\r\ncommand relatively high prices.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if average land, without manure, will produce fifteen\r\nbushels of wheat per acre and 100 bushels of potatoes, and a given\r\nquantity of manure costing, say $25, will double the crop, we have, in\r\nthe one case, _an increase_ of:--\r\n\r\n  15 bushels of wheat at $1.50          $22.50\r\n  15 cwt. of straw                        3.50\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                        $26.00\r\n    Cost of manure                       25.00\r\n                                        ------\r\n  Profit from using manure               $1.00\r\n\r\nAnd in the other:--\r\n\r\n  100 bushels of potatoes at 50 cents   $50.00\r\n  Cost of manure                         25.00\r\n                                        ------\r\n    Profit from using manure            $25.00\r\n\r\nThe only question is, whether the same quantity of the right kind of\r\nmanure is as likely to double the potato crop as to double the wheat\r\ncrop, when both are raised on average land.\r\n\r\n“It is not an easy matter,” said the Deacon, “to double the yield of\r\npotatoes.”\r\n\r\n“Neither is it,” said I, “to double the yield of wheat, but both can be\r\ndone, provided you start low enough. If your land is clean, and well\r\nworked, and dry, and only produces ten bushels of wheat per acre, there\r\nis no difficulty in making it produce twenty bushels; and so of\r\npotatoes. If the land be dry and well cultivated, and, barring the bugs,\r\nproduces without manure 75 bushels per acre, there ought to be no\r\ndifficulty in making it produce 150 bushels.\r\n\r\n“But if your land produces, without manure, 150 bushels, it is not\r\nalways easy to make it produce 300 bushels. Fortunately, or\r\nunfortunately, our land is, in most cases, poor enough to start with,\r\nand we ought to be able to use manure on potatoes to great advantage.”\r\n\r\n“But will not the manure,” asked the Deacon, “injure the quality of the\r\npotatoes?”\r\n\r\nI think not. So far as my experiments and experience go, the judicious\r\nuse of good manure, on dry land, favors the perfect maturity of the\r\ntubers and the formation of starch. I never manured potatoes so highly\r\nas I did last year (1877), and never had potatoes of such high quality.\r\nThey cook white, dry, and mealy. We made furrows two and a half feet\r\napart, and spread rich, well-rotted manure in the furrows, and planted\r\nthe potatoes on top of the manure, and covered them with a plow. In our\r\nclimate, I am inclined to think, it would be better to apply the manure\r\nto the land for potatoes the autumn previous. If sod land, spread the\r\nmanure on the surface, and let it lie exposed all winter. If stubble\r\nland, plow it in the fall, and then spread the manure in the fall or\r\nwinter, and plow it under in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nWHAT CROPS SHOULD MANURE BE APPLIED TO.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It will not do any harm on any crop,” said the Deacon, “but on my farm\r\nit seems to be most convenient to draw it out in the winter or spring,\r\nand plow it under for corn. I do not know any farmer except you who uses\r\nit on potatoes.”\r\n\r\nMy own rule is to apply manure to those crops which require the most\r\nlabor per acre. But I am well aware that this rule will have many\r\nexceptions. For instance, it will often pay well to use manure on\r\nbarley, and yet barley requires far less labor than corn or potatoes.\r\n\r\nPeople who let out, and those who work farms “on shares” seldom\r\nunderstand this matter clearly. I knew a farmer, who last year let out a\r\nfield of good land, that had been in corn the previous year, to a man to\r\nsow to barley, and afterwards to wheat on “the halves.” Another part of\r\nthe farm was taken by a man to plant corn and potatoes on similar terms,\r\nand another man put in several acres of cabbage, beets, carrots, and\r\nonions on halves. It never seemed to occur to either of them that the\r\nconditions were unequal. The expense of digging and harvesting the\r\npotato-crop alone was greater than the whole cost of the barley-crop;\r\nwhile, after the barley was off, the land was plowed once, harrowed, and\r\nsowed to winter wheat; and nothing more has to be done to it until the\r\nnext harvest. With the garden crops, the difference is even still more\r\nstriking. The labor expended on one acre of onions or carrots would put\r\nin and harvest a ten-acre field of barley. If the tenant gets pay for\r\nhis labor, the landlord would get say $5 an acre for his barley land,\r\nand $50 for his carrot and onion land. I am pretty sure the tenants did\r\nnot see the matter in this light, nor the farmer either.\r\n\r\nCrops which require a large amount of labor can only be grown on very\r\nrich land. Our successful market-gardeners, seed-growers, and nurserymen\r\nunderstand this matter. They must get great crops or they cannot pay\r\ntheir labor bill. And the principle is applicable to ordinary farm\r\ncrops. Some of them require much more labor than others, and should\r\nnever be grown unless the land is capable of producing a maximum yield\r\nper acre, or a close approximation to it. As a rule, the least-paying\r\ncrops are those which require the least labor per acre. Farmers are\r\nafraid to expend much money for labor. They are wise in this, unless all\r\nthe conditions are favorable. But when they have land in a high state of\r\ncultivation--drained, clean, mellow, and rich--it would usually pay them\r\nwell to grow crops which require the most labor.\r\n\r\nAnd it should never be forgotten that, as compared with nearly all other\r\ncountries, our labor is expensive. No matter how cheap our land may be,\r\nwe can not afford to waste our labor. It is too costly. If men would\r\nwork for nothing, and board themselves, there are localities where we\r\ncould perhaps afford to keep sheep that shear two pounds of wool a year;\r\nor cows that make 75 lbs. of butter. We might make a profit out of a\r\nwheat crop of 8 bushels per acre, or a corn-crop of 15 bushels, or a\r\npotato-crop of 50 bushels. But it cannot be done with labor costing from\r\n$1.00 to $1.25 per day. And I do not believe labor will cost much less\r\nin our time. The only thing we can do is to employ it to the best\r\nadvantage. Machinery will help us to some extent, but I can see no real\r\nescape from our difficulties in this matter, except to raise larger\r\ncrops per acre.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary farming, “larger crops per acre” means fewer acres planted\r\nor sown with grain. It means more summer fallow, more grass, clover,\r\npeas, mustard, coleseed, roots, and other crops that are consumed on the\r\nfarm. It means more thorough cultivation. It means clean and rich land.\r\nIt means husbanding the ammonia and nitric acid, which is brought to the\r\nsoil, as well as that which is developed from the soil, or which the\r\nsoil attracts from the atmosphere, and using it to grow a crop every\r\nsecond, third, or fourth year, instead of every year. If a piece of land\r\nwill grow 25 bushels of corn every year, we should aim to so manage it,\r\nthat it will grow 50 every other year, or 75 every third year, or, if\r\nthe _climate_ is capable of doing it, of raising 100 bushels per acre\r\nevery fourth year.\r\n\r\nTheoretically this can be done, and in one of Mr. Lawes’ experiments he\r\ndid it practically in the case of a summer-fallow for wheat, the one\r\ncrop in two years giving a little more than two crops sown in\r\nsuccession. But on sandy land we should probably lose a portion of the\r\nliberated plant-food, unless we grew a crop of some kind every year. And\r\nthe matter organized in the renovating crop could not be rendered\r\ncompletely available for the next crop. _In the end_, however, we ought\r\nto be able to get it with little or no loss. How best to accomplish this\r\nresult, is one of the most interesting and important fields for\r\nscientific investigation and practical experiment. We know enough,\r\nhowever, to be sure that there is a great advantage in waiting until\r\nthere is a sufficient accumulation of available plant-food in the soil\r\nto produce a large yield, before sowing a crop that requires much labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we do not want to wait, we must apply manure. If we have no barn-yard\r\nor stable-manure, we must buy artificials.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW AND WHEN MANURE SHOULD BE APPLIED.\r\n\r\nThis is not a merely theoretical or chemical question. We must take into\r\nconsideration the _cost_ of application. Also, whether we apply it at a\r\nbusy or a leisure season. I have seen it recommended, for instance, to\r\nspread manure on meadow-land immediately after the hay-crop was removed.\r\nNow, I think this may be theoretically very good advice. But, on my\r\nfarm, it would throw the work right into the midst of wheat and barley\r\nharvests; and I should make the theory bend a little to my convenience.\r\nThe meadows would have to wait until we had got in the crops--or until\r\nharvest operations were stopped by rain.\r\n\r\nI mention this merely to show the complex character of this question. On\r\nmy own farm, the most leisure season of the year, except the winter, is\r\nimmediately after wheat harvest. And, as already stated, it is at this\r\ntime that John Johnston draws out his manure and spreads it on\r\ngrass-land intended to be plowed up the following spring for corn.\r\n\r\nIf the manure was free from weed-seeds, many of our best farmers, if\r\nthey had some well-rotted manure like this of John Johnston’s, would\r\ndraw it out and spread it on their fields prepared for winter-wheat.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I should draw out the manure in heaps and then spread it\r\ncarefully. Then harrow it, and if the harrow pulls the manure into\r\nheaps, spread them and harrow again. It is of the greatest importance to\r\nspread manure evenly and mix it thoroughly with the soil. If this work\r\nis well done, and the manure is well-rotted, it will not interfere with\r\nthe drill. And the manure will be near the surface, where the young\r\nroots of the wheat can get hold of it.\r\n\r\n“You must recollect,” said the Doctor, “that the roots can only take up\r\nthe manure when in solution.”\r\n\r\n“It must also be remembered,” said I, “that a light rain of, say, only\r\nhalf an inch, pours down on to the manures spread on an acre of land\r\nabout 14,000 gallons of water, or about 56 tons. If you have put on 8\r\ntons of manure, half an inch of rain would furnish a gallon of water to\r\neach pound of manure. It is not difficult to understand, therefore, how\r\nmanure applied on the surface, or near the surface, can be taken up by\r\nthe young roots.”\r\n\r\n“That puts the matter in a new light to me,” said the Deacon. “If the\r\nmanure was plowed under, five or six inches deep, it would require an\r\nabundant rain to reach the manure. And it is not one year in five that\r\nwe get rain enough to thoroughly soak the soil for several weeks after\r\nsowing the wheat in August or September. And when it does come, the\r\nseason is so far advanced that the wheat plants make little growth.”\r\n\r\nMy own opinion is, that on clayey land, manure will act much quicker if\r\napplied on, or near the surface, than if plowed under. Clay mixed with\r\nmanure arrests or checks decomposition. Sand has no such effect. If\r\nanything, it favors a more active decomposition, and hence, manure acts\r\nmuch more rapidly on sandy land than on clay land. And I think, as a\r\nrule, where a farmer advocates the application of manure on the surface,\r\nit will be found that he occupies clay land or a heavy loam; while those\r\nwho oppose the practice, and think manure should be plowed under, occupy\r\nsandy land or sandy loam.\r\n\r\n“J. J. Thomas,” said I, “once gave me a new idea.”\r\n\r\n“Is that anything strange,” remarked the Deacon. “Are ideas so scarce\r\namong you agricultural writers, that you can recollect who first\r\nsuggested them?”\r\n\r\n“Be that as it may,” said I, “this idea has had a decided influence on\r\nmy farm practice. I will not say that the idea originated with Mr.\r\nThomas, but at any rate, it was new to me. I had always been in the\r\nhabit, when spading in manure in the garden, of putting the manure in\r\nthe trench and covering it up; and in plowing it in, I thought it was\r\ndesirable to put it at the bottom of the furrow where the next furrow\r\nwould cover it up.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Deacon, “and what objection is there to the practice?”\r\n\r\n“I am not objecting to the practice. I do not say that it is not a good\r\nplan. It may often be the only practicable method of applying manure.\r\nBut it is well to know that there is _sometimes_ a better plan. The idea\r\nthat Mr. Thomas gave me, was, that it was very desirable to break up the\r\nmanure fine, spread it evenly, and thoroughly mix it with the soil.\r\n\r\n“After the manure is spread on the soil,” said Mr. Thomas, “and before\r\nplowing it in, great benefit is derived by thoroughly harrowing the\r\ntop-soil, thus breaking finely both the manure and the soil, and mixing\r\nthem well together. Another way for the perfect diffusion of the manure\r\namong the particles of earth, is, to spread the manure in autumn, so\r\nthat, all the rains of this season may dissolve the soluble portions and\r\ncarry them down among the particles, where they are absorbed and\r\nretained for the growing crop.\r\n\r\n“In experiments,” continues Mr. Thomas, “when the manure for corn was\r\nthus applied in autumn, has afforded a yield of about 70 bushels per\r\nacre, when the same amount applied in spring, gave only 50 bushels.\r\nA thin coating of manure applied to winter-wheat at the time of sowing,\r\nand was harrowed in, has increased the crop from 7 to 10 bushels per\r\nacre--and in addition to this, by the stronger growth it has caused, as\r\nwell as by the protection it has afforded to the surface, it has not\r\nunfrequently saved the crop from partial or total winter-killing.\r\n\r\n“In cases where it is necessary to apply coarse manures at once, much\r\nmay be done in lessening the evils of coarseness by artificially\r\ngrinding it into the soil. The instrument called the drag-roller--which\r\nis like the common roller set stiff so as not to revolve--has been used\r\nto great advantage for this purpose, by passing it over the surface in\r\nconnection with the harrow. We have known this treatment to effect a\r\nthorough intermixture, and to more than double the crop obtained by\r\ncommon management with common manure.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTOP-DRESSING WITH MANURE.\r\n\r\nThe term “top-dressing” usually refers to sowing or spreading manures\r\non the growing crop. For instance, we top-dress pastures or meadows by\r\nspreading manure on the surface. If we sow nitrate of soda, or guano, on\r\nour winter-wheat in the spring, that would be top-dressing. We often sow\r\ngypsum on clover, and on barley, and peas, while the plants are growing\r\nin the spring, and this is top-dressing.\r\n\r\n“If the gypsum was sown broadcast on the land before sowing the seed,”\r\nsaid the Deacon, “would not that be top-dressing also?”\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, I suppose that would not be top-dressing.\r\n\r\nTop-dressing in the sense in which I understand the term, is seldom\r\nadopted, except on meadows and pastures as a regular system. It is an\r\nafter-thought. We have sown wheat on a poor, sandy knoll, and we draw\r\nout some manure and spread on it in the winter or early spring; or we\r\ntop-dress it with hen-manure, or guano, or nitrate of soda and\r\nsuperphosphate. I do not say that this is better than to apply the\r\nmanure at the time of sowing the wheat, but if we neglect to do so,\r\nthen top-dressing is a commendable practice.\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker reports the result of some experiments in top-dressing\r\nwinter-wheat on the farm of the Royal Agricultural College at\r\nCirencester, England. The manures were finely sifted and mixed with\r\nabout ten times their weight of fine soil, and sown broadcast on the\r\ngrowing wheat, March 22. A fine rain occurred the following day, and\r\nwashed the manure into the soil. The following is the yield per acre:--\r\n\r\n  No manure                        27    bushels and 1984 lbs. of straw.\r\n  280 lbs. Peruvian guano          40      ”      ”  2576  ”        ”\r\n  195  ”   nitrate of soda         38      ”      ”  2695  ”        ”\r\n  180  ”   nitrate of soda, and\r\n    168 lbs. of common salt        40½     ”      ”  2736  ”        ”\r\n  448 lbs. Proctor’s wheat-manure  39½     ”      ”  2668  ”        ”\r\n  672  ”       ”        ”   ”      44¼     ”      ”  3032  ”        ”\r\n  4 tons chalk-marl                27      ”      ”  1872  ”        ”\r\n\r\nThe manures in each case cost $7.80 per acre, except the large dose of\r\nProctor’s wheat-manure, which cost $11.70 per acre. The wheat was worth\r\n$1.26 per bushel. Leaving the value of the straw out of the question,\r\nthe profit from the use of the top dressing was:\r\n\r\n  With guano                              $8.70 per acre.\r\n   ”   nitrate of soda                     6.00\r\n   ”   nitrate of soda and common salt     9.33\r\n   ”   448 lbs. wheat-manure               7.94\r\n   ”   672  ”     ”     ”                 10.16\r\n\r\nThe marl did no good.\r\n\r\nThe nitrate of soda and common salt contained no phosphoric acid,\r\nand yet produced an excellent effect. The guano and the wheat-manure\r\ncontained phosphoric acid as well as nitrogen, and the following crop of\r\nclover would be likely to get some benefit from it.\r\n\r\nJohn Johnston wrote in 1868, “I have used manure only as a top-dressing\r\nfor the last 26 years, and I do think one load, used in that way, is\r\nworth far more than two loads plowed under on our stiff land.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nMANURES ON PERMANENT MEADOWS AND PASTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this country, where labor is comparatively high, and hay often\r\ncommands a good price, a good, permanent meadow frequently affords as\r\nmuch real profit as any other portion of the farm. Now that we have good\r\nmowing-machines, tedders, rakes, and loading and unloading apparatus,\r\nthe labor of hay-making is greatly lessened. The only difficulty is to\r\nkeep up and increase the annual growth of good grass.\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments on top-dressing meadows are reported from year to\r\nyear. The results, of course, differ considerably, being influenced by\r\nthe soil and season. The profit of the practice depends very much on the\r\nprice of hay. In the Eastern States, hay generally commands a higher\r\nrelative price than grain, and it not unfrequently happens that we can\r\nuse manure on grass to decided advantage.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated experiments of Messrs. Lawes & Gilbert with “Manures on\r\nPermanent Meadow-land” were commenced in 1856, and have been continued\r\non the same plots every year since that time.\r\n\r\n“You need not be afraid, Deacon,” said I, as the old gentleman commenced\r\nto button up his coat, “I am not going into the details of these\r\nwonderful experiments; but I am sure you will be interested in the\r\nresults of the first six or seven years.”\r\n\r\nThe following table explains itself:\r\n\r\nExperiments with Manures on Permanent Meadow land at Rothamsted,\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n  Hay/Acre 20th (1875): Hay per Acre the 20th Season, 1875.\r\n  Total/Acre: Total Hay (per) Acre.\r\n\r\n----+-------------------------------+----------------------------------+\r\n    |                               | Annual Produce of Hay            |\r\n    |                               |          per Acre in Lbs.        |\r\n    |                               +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n    |   Description and Amount of   |1856|1857|1858|1859|1860|1861|1862|\r\n    |       Manures per Acre.       |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n----+-------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n  1 |No manure                      |2433|2724|3116|2558|2822|3074|3238|\r\n  2{|400 lbs. ammonia-salts = 82    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n   {|  lbs. of nitrogen             |4028|3774|3982|3644|2940|3808|3854|\r\n    |                               |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  3 |Superphosphate of lime         |    |    |    |2828|3176|3400|3252|\r\n  4{|400 lbs. ammonia-salts and     |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n   {|  superphosphate of lime       |    |    |    |4996|4788|4968|4756|\r\n  5 |Mixed mineral manures          |3429|3666|4082|3416|3928|4488|4424|\r\n  6 |400 lbs. ammonia-salts and     |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n    |  mixed mineral manures        |6363|6422|7172|6198|5624|6316|6402|\r\n  7 |800 lbs. ammonia-salts and     |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n    |  mixed mineral manures        |7054|6940|7508|7150|5744|6710|7108|\r\n  8 |800 lbs. ammonia-salts and     |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n    |  mixed mineral manures,       |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n    |  including 200 lbs. each      |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n    |  silicates, soda, and lime    |    |    |    |    |    |    |7120|\r\n    |                               |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  9 |275 lbs. nitrate of soda       |    |    |2952|3588|3948|4092|4446|\r\n 10 |550 lbs. nitrate of soda = 82  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n    |  lbs. of nitrogen             |    |    |3564|4116|4410|4452|4086|\r\n 11 |Mixed mineral manures and 275  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n    |  lbs. nitrate of soda         |    |    |4236|4956|4812|5514|5178|\r\n 12 |Mixed mineral manures and 550  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n    |  lbs. nitrate of soda         |    |    |5636|6072|5586|5892|5718|\r\n 13 |14 tons farmyard-manure        |4030|5328|4164|4584|5208|5052|5060|\r\n 14 |14 tons farmyard-manure and    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n    |  200 lbs. ammonia-salts       |5009|6008|5320|5356|5704|5320|5556|\r\n----+-------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n\r\n  --------------------+----------------+----\r\n    Average Hay per   |   Hay/Acre     |\r\n          Acre.       |  20th (1875)   |\r\n  ---------+----------+----+----+------+\r\n  1st 7 Yrs| 20 Years.|1st |2nd |Total |\r\n   1856-62.|          |Crop|Crop| /Acre|\r\n  ---------+----------+----+----+------+----\r\n     2824  |   2534   |2436|1491|  3927|  1\r\n           |          |    |    |      |\r\n     3719  |   2940   |2702|2016|  4718|  2\r\n  (4 yrs.)}|(17 yrs.)}|    |    |      |\r\n     3164 }|   2492  }|2352|1722|  4074|  3\r\n  (4 yrs.)}|(17 yrs.)}|    |    |      |\r\n     4877 }|   3612  }|4102|1610|  5712|  4\r\n     3919  |   3948   |4564|2688|  7252|  5\r\n           |          |    |    |      |\r\n     6357  |   5712   |5824|2744|  8508|  6\r\n           |          |    |    |      |\r\n     6876  |   6454   |6222|5684|10,906|  7\r\n           |          |    |    |      |\r\n           |          |    |    |      |\r\n           |          |    |    |      |\r\n           |   7000   |6720|4592|11,312|  8\r\n   1858-62}|(18 yrs.)}|    |    |      |\r\n     3805 }|   3794  }|3360|1456|  4816|  9\r\n           |(18 yrs.)}|    |    |      |\r\n     4126  |   3962  }|3276|1470|  4746| 10\r\n           |(18 yrs.)}|    |    |      |\r\n     4939  |   5208  }|5040|1862|  6902| 11\r\n           |(18 yrs.)}|    |    |      |\r\n     5783  |   6384  }|7028|1974|  9002| 12\r\n     4775  |   4130   |2996|1316|  4312| 13\r\n           |          |    |    |      |\r\n     5468  |   4816   |3766|1960|  5726| 14\r\n  ---------+----------+----+----+------+----\r\n\r\nThese are all the figures I will trouble you with. The “mixed mineral\r\nmanures” consisted of superphosphate of lime (composed of 150 lbs.\r\nbone-ash and 150 lbs. sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1.7), 300 lbs. sulphate of\r\npotash, 200 lbs. sulphate of soda, and 100 lbs. sulphate of magnesia.\r\nThe ammonia-salts consisted of equal parts sulphate and muriate of\r\nammonia, containing about 25 per cent. of ammonia. The manures were sown\r\nas early as possible in the spring, and, if the weather was suitable,\r\nsometimes in February. The farmyard-manure was spread on the land, in\r\nthe first year, in the spring, afterwards in November or December. The\r\nhay was cut from the middle to the last of June; and the aftermath was\r\npastured off by sheep in October.\r\n\r\n“It is curious,” said the Deacon, “that 400 lbs. of ammonia-salts should\r\ngive as great an increase in the yield of hay the first year as 14 tons\r\nof farmyard-manure, but the second year the farmyard-manure comes out\r\ndecidedly ahead.”\r\n\r\n“The farmyard-manure,” said I, “was applied every year, at the rate of\r\n14 gross tons per acre, for eight years--1856 to 1863. After 1863, this\r\nplot was left without manure of any kind. The average yield of this\r\nplot, during the first 8 years was 4,800 lbs. of hay per acre.”\r\n\r\nOn the plot dressed with 14 tons of farmyard-manure and 200 lbs.\r\nammonia-salts, the average yield of hay for 8 years was 5,544 lbs. per\r\nacre. After the eighth year the farmyard-manure was discontinued, and\r\nduring the next twelve years the yield of hay averaged 3,683 lbs., or\r\n1,149 lbs. more than the continuously unmanured plot.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, superphosphate of lime was used alone on plot 3, and has been\r\ncontinued ever since. It seems clear that this land, which had been in\r\npasture or meadow for a hundred years or more, was not deficient in\r\nphosphates.\r\n\r\n“It does not seem,” said the Deacon, “to have been deficient in\r\nanything. The twentieth crop, on the continuously unmanured plot was\r\nnearly 1¼ ton per acre, the first cutting, and nearly ¾-ton the second\r\ncutting. And apparently the land was just as rich in 1875, as it was in\r\n1856, and yet over 25 tons of hay had been cut and _removed_ from the\r\nland, without any manure being returned. And yet we are told that hay is\r\na very exhausting crop.”\r\n\r\n“Superphosphate alone,” said the Doctor, “did very little to increase\r\nthe yield of hay, but superphosphate _and_ ammonia produced the first\r\nyear, 1859, over a ton more hay per acre than the superphosphate alone,\r\nand when _potash_ is added to the manure, the yield is still further\r\nincreased.”\r\n\r\n“Answer me one question,” said the Deacon, “and let us leave the\r\nsubject. In the light of these and other experiments, what do you\r\nconsider the cheapest and best manure to apply to a permanent meadow or\r\npasture?”\r\n\r\n“Rich, well-decomposed farmyard or stable manure,” said I, “and if it is\r\nnot rich, apply 200 lbs. of nitrate of soda per acre, in addition. This\r\nwill make it rich. Poor manure, made from straw, corn-stalks, hay, etc.,\r\nis poor in nitrogen, and comparatively rich in potash. The nitrate of\r\nsoda will supply the deficiency of nitrogen. On the sea-shore fish-scrap\r\nis a cheaper source of nitrogen, and may be used instead of the nitrate\r\nof soda.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR SPECIAL CROPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR HOPS.\r\n\r\n“For hops,” said the Doctor, “there is nothing better than rich,\r\nwell-decomposed farmyard-manure--such manure as you are now making from\r\nyour pigs that are bedded with stable-manure.”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” said I, “and the better you feed your horses and pigs, the\r\nbetter will the manure be for hops. In England, Mr. Paine, of Surrey,\r\nmade a series of experiments with different manures for hops, and, as\r\nthe result of four years trial, reported that _rape-cake_, singly, or\r\nin combination, invariably proved the best manure for hops. In this\r\ncountry, cotton-seed, or cotton-seed-cake, would be a good substitute\r\nfor the rape-cake. Whatever manure is used should be used liberally.\r\nHops require a large amount of labor per acre, and it is, therefore,\r\nspecially desirable to obtain a large yield per acre. This can be\r\naccomplished only by the most lavish expenditure of manure. And all\r\nexperience seems to show that it must be manure _rich in nitrogen_. In\r\nthe hop districts of England, 25 tons of rich farmyard-manure are\r\napplied per acre; and in addition to this, soot and rags, both rich in\r\nnitrogen, have long been popular auxiliaries. The value of soot is due\r\nto the fact that it contains from 12 to 15 per cent of sulphate of\r\nammonia, and the fact that it has been so long used with success as a\r\nmanure for hops, seems to prove that sulphate of ammonia, which can now\r\nbe readily obtained, could be used to advantage by our hop-growers--say\r\nat the rate, in addition to farm-yard manure, of 500 lbs. per acre, sown\r\nbroadcast early in the spring.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nWhen tobacco is grown for wrappers, it is desirable to get a large,\r\nstrong leaf. The richest land is selected for the crop, and large\r\nquantities of the richest and most stimulating manures are used.\r\n\r\nLike cabbages, this crop requires a large amount of plant-food per acre;\r\nand, like them, it can only be grown by constant and high manuring. More\r\nmanure must be used than the plants can take up out of the soil, and\r\nhence it is, that land which has been used for growing tobacco for some\r\nyears, will be in high condition for other crops without further\r\nmanuring.\r\n\r\nFarm-yard or stable-manure, must be the mainstay of the tobacco-planter.\r\nWith this, he can use artificial fertilizers to advantage--such as\r\nfish-scrap, woollen-rags, Peruvian guano, dried blood, slaughter-house\r\noffal, sulphate of ammonia, nitrate of soda, etc.\r\n\r\nFor choice, high-flavored smoking-tobacco, the grower aims to get\r\nquality rather than quantity. This seems to depend more on the land and\r\nthe climate than on the manures used. Superphosphate of lime would be\r\nlikely to prove advantageous in favoring the early growth and maturity\r\nof the crop. And in raising tobacco-plants in the seed-bed, I should\r\nexpect good results from the use of superphosphate, raked into the soil\r\nat the rate of three or four lbs. per square rod.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR INDIAN CORN.\r\n\r\nWe know less about the manurial requirements of Indian corn, than of\r\nalmost any other crop we cultivate. We know that wheat, barley, oats,\r\nand grasses, require for their maximum growth a liberal supply of\r\navailable nitrogen in the soil. And such facts and experiments as we\r\nhave, seem to indicate that the same is also true of Indian corn. It is,\r\nat any rate, reasonable to suppose that, as Indian corn belongs to the\r\nsame botanical order as wheat, barley, oats, rye, timothy, and other\r\ngrasses, the general manurial requirements would be the same. Such,\r\nI presume, is the case; and yet there seem to be some facts that would\r\nincline us to place Indian corn with the leguminous plants, such as\r\nclover, peas, and beans, rather than with the cereals, wheat, barley,\r\noats, etc.\r\n\r\n“Why so,” asked the Deacon, “Indian corn does not have much in common\r\nwith beans, peas, and clover?”\r\n\r\nAs we have shown, clover can get more nitrogen out of the soil, than\r\nwheat, barley, and oats. And the same is true of beans and peas, though\r\nprobably not to so great an extent.\r\n\r\nNow, it would seem that Indian corn can get more nitrogen out of a soil,\r\nthan wheat, barley, or oats--and to this extent, at least, we may\r\nconsider Indian corn as a renovating crop. In other words, the Indian\r\ncorn can get more nitrogen out of the soil, than wheat, barley, and\r\noats--and when we feed out the corn and stalks on the farm, we have more\r\nfood and more manure than if we raised and fed out a crop of oats,\r\nbarley, or wheat. If this idea is correct, then Indian corn, when\r\nconsumed on the farm, should not be classed with what the English\r\nfarmers term “white crops,” but rather with the “green crops.” In other\r\nwords, Indian corn is what old writers used to call a “fallow crop”--or\r\nwhat we call a renovating crop.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, then the growth and consumption of Indian corn on the\r\nfarm, as is the case with clover, should leave the farm richer for\r\nwheat, rather than poorer. I do not mean richer absolutely, but richer\r\nso far as the _available_ supply of plant-food is concerned.\r\n\r\n“It may be that you are right,” said the Doctor, “when corn is grown for\r\n_fodder_, but not when grown for the grain. It is the formation of the\r\nseed which exhausts the soil.”\r\n\r\nIf I could be sure that it was true of corn-fodder, I should have little\r\ndoubt that it is true also of corn as ordinarily grown for grain and\r\nstalks. For, I think, it is clear that the grain is formed at the\r\nexpense of the stalks, and not directly from the soil. The corn-fodder\r\nwill take from the soil as much nitrogen and phosphoric acid as the crop\r\nof corn, and the more it will take, the more it approximates in\r\ncharacter to clover and other renovating crops. If corn-fodder is a\r\nrenovating crop, so is the ordinary corn-crop, also, provided it is\r\nconsumed on the farm.\r\n\r\n“But what makes you think,” said the Deacon, “that corn can get more\r\nnitrogen from the soil, than wheat?”\r\n\r\n“That is the real point, Deacon,” said I, “and I will ask you this\r\nquestion. Suppose you had a field of wheat seeded down to clover, and\r\nthe clover failed. After harvest, you plow up half of the field and sow\r\nit to wheat again, the other half of the field you plow in the spring,\r\nand plant with Indian corn. Now, suppose you get 15 bushels of wheat to\r\nthe acre, how much corn do you think you would be likely to get?”\r\n\r\n“Well, that depends,” said the Deacon, “but I should expect at least 30\r\nbushels of shelled corn per acre.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, and I think most farmers would tell you the same; you get\r\ntwice as much corn and stalks to the acre as you would of wheat and\r\nstraw. In other words, while the wheat cannot find more nitrogen than is\r\nnecessary to produce 15 bushels of wheat and straw, the corn can find,\r\nand does find, take up, and organize, at least twice as much nitrogen as\r\nthe wheat.”\r\n\r\nIf these are facts, then the remarks we have made in regard to the value\r\nof clover as a fertilizing crop, are applicable in some degree to Indian\r\ncorn. To grow clover and sell it, will in the end impoverish the soil;\r\nto grow clover and feed it out, will enrich the land. And the same will\r\nbe true of Indian corn. It will gather up nitrogen that the wheat-crop\r\ncan not appropriate; and when the corn and stalks are fed out, some 90\r\nper cent of the nitrogen will be left in the manure.\r\n\r\n“You do not think, then,” said the Doctor, “that nitrogen is such an\r\nimportant element in manure for corn, as it is in a manure for wheat.”\r\n\r\nI have not said that. If we want a large crop of corn, we shall usually\r\nneed a liberal supply of available nitrogen. But this is because a\r\nlarger crop of corn means a much larger produce per acre, than a large\r\ncrop of wheat. Forty bushels of wheat per acre is an unusually large\r\ncrop with us; but 80 bushels of shelled corn can be grown in a favorable\r\nseason, and on rich, well-cultivated land. As the Deacon has said, 30\r\nbushels of corn per acre can be grown as easily as 15 bushels of wheat;\r\nand it is quite probable, in many cases, that a manure containing no\r\nnitrogen, might give us a crop of 35 or 40 bushels per acre. In other\r\nwords, up to a certain point, manures containing mineral, or\r\ncarbonaceous matter, might frequently, in ordinary agriculture, increase\r\nthe yield of Indian corn; while on similar land, such manures would have\r\nlittle effect on wheat.\r\n\r\n“That is so,” said the Deacon, “we all know that plaster frequently\r\nincreases the growth of corn, while it seldom does much good on wheat.”\r\n\r\nBut, after you have got as large a crop as the land will produce, aided\r\nby plaster, ashes, and superphosphate, say 40 bushels of shelled corn\r\nper acre, _then_ if you want to raise 70 bushels per acre, you must\r\nfurnish the soil with manures containing sufficient available nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago, I made some careful experiments with artificial manures\r\non Indian corn.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said the Deacon, “they were made on the south lot, in front\r\nof my house, and I recollect that the N.Y. State Ag. Society awarded you\r\na prize of $75 for them.”\r\n\r\n“And I recollect,” said I, “how you and some other neighbors laughed at\r\nme for spending so much time in measuring the land and applying the\r\nmanures, and measuring the crop. But I wish I could have afforded to\r\ncontinue them. A single experiment, however carefully made, can not be\r\ndepended on. However, I will give the results for what they are worth,\r\nwith some remarks made at the time:\r\n\r\n“The soil on which the experiments were made, is a light, sandy loam. It\r\nhas been under cultivation for upwards of twenty years, and so far as I\r\ncan ascertain has never been manured. It has been somewhat impoverished\r\nby the growth of cereal crops, and it was thought that for this reason,\r\nand on account of its light texture and active character, which would\r\ncause the manures to act immediately, it was well adapted for the\r\npurpose of showing the effect of different manurial substances on the\r\ncorn-crop.\r\n\r\n“The land was clover-sod, two years old, pastured the previous summer.\r\nIt was plowed early in the spring, and harrowed until in excellent\r\ncondition. The corn was planted May 23, in hills 3½ feet apart each way.\r\n\r\n“The manures were applied in the hill immediately before the seed was\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\n“With superphosphate of lime, and with plaster (gypsum, or _sulphate of\r\nlime_), the seed was placed directly on top of the manure, as it is well\r\nknown that these manures do not injure the germinating principle of even\r\nthe smallest seeds.\r\n\r\n“The ashes were dropped in the hill, and then covered with soil, and the\r\nseed planted on the top, so that it should not come in contact with the\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n“Guano and sulphate of ammonia were treated in the same way.\r\n\r\n“On the plots where ashes and guano, or ashes and sulphate of ammonia\r\nwere both used, the ashes were first put in the hill, and covered with\r\nsoil, and the guano or sulphate of ammonia placed on the top, and also\r\ncovered with soil before the seed was planted. The ashes and\r\nsuperphosphate of lime was also treated in the same way. It is well\r\nknown that unleached ashes, mixed either with guano, sulphate of\r\nammonia, or superphosphate, mutually decompose each other, setting free\r\nthe ammonia of the guano and sulphate of ammonia, and converting the\r\nsoluble phosphate of the superphosphate of lime into the insoluble form\r\nin which it existed before treatment with sulphuric acid. All the plots\r\nwere planted on the same day, and the manures weighed and applied under\r\nmy own immediate supervision. Everything was done that was deemed\r\nnecessary to secure accuracy.\r\n\r\n“The following table gives the results of the experiments:\r\n\r\n  Table Showing the Results of Experiments on Indian Corn.\r\n\r\nSdC  Bushels of ears of sound corn per acre.\r\nSfC  Bushels of ears of soft corn per acre.\r\nTC   Total No. of bushels of ears of corn per acre.\r\nISdC Increase per acre of ears sound corn.\r\nISfC Increase per acre of ears of soft corn.\r\nTIC  Total increase per acre of ears of corn.\r\n\r\n-----+----------------------------------+-----+----+-----+----+----+----\r\n     |   Descriptions of manures and    |     |    |     |    |    |\r\nPlots|   quantities applied per acre    | SdC | SfC|  TC |ISdC|ISfC|TIC\r\n-----+----------------------------------+-----+----+-----+----+----+----\r\n  1. |No manure                         |  60 |  7 |  67 | .. | .. | ..\r\n  2. |100 lbs. plaster (gypsum or       |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  sulphate of lime)               |  70 |  8 |  78 | 10 |  1 | 11\r\n  3. |400 lbs. unleached wood-ashes     |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  and 100 lbs. plaster (mixed)    |  68 | 10 |  78 |  8 |  3 | 11\r\n  4. |150 lbs. sulphate of ammonia      |  90 | 15 | 105 | 30 |  8 | 38\r\n  5. |300 lbs. superphosphate of lime   |  70 |  8 |  78 | 10 |  1 | 11\r\n  6. |150 lbs. sulphate of ammonia      |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  and 300 lbs. superphosphate of  |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  lime (mixed)                    |  85 |  5 |  90 | 25 | .. | 23\r\n  7. |400 lbs. unleached wood-ashes,    |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  (uncertain)                     |  60 | 12 |  72 | .. |  5 |  5\r\n  8. |150 lbs. sulphate of ammonia and  |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  400 lbs. unleached wood-ashes   |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  (sown separately)               |  87 | 10 |  97 | 27 |  3 | 30\r\n  9. |300 lbs. superphosphate of lime,  |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  150 lbs. sulph. ammonia, and    |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  400 lbs. unleached wood-ashes   | 100 |  8 | 108 | 40 |  1 | 41\r\n 10. |400 lbs. unleached wood-ashes     |  60 |  8 |  68 | .. |  1 |  1\r\n 11. |100 lbs. plaster. 400 lbs.        |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  unleached wood-ashes, 300 lbs.  |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  superphosphate of lime, and     |     |    |     |    |    |\r\n     |  200 lbs.

The sulphate of ammonia was a\r\ngood, commercial article, obtained from London, at a cost of about seven\r\ncents per pound. The ashes were made from beech and hard maple (_Acer\r\nsaccharinum_) wood, and were sifted through a fine sieve before being\r\nweighed. The guano was the best Peruvian, costing about three cents per\r\npound. It was crushed and sifted before using. In sowing the ashes on\r\nplot 7, an error occurred in their application, and for the purpose of\r\nchecking the result, it was deemed advisable to repeat the experiment on\r\nplot 10.\r\n\r\n“On plot 5, with 300 lbs. of superphosphate of lime per acre, the plants\r\ncame up first, and exhibited a healthy, dark-green appearance, which\r\nthey retained for some time. This result was not anticipated, though it\r\nis well known that superphosphate of lime has the effect of stimulating\r\nthe germination of turnip-seed, and the early growth of the plants to an\r\nastonishing degree; yet, as it has no such effect on wheat, it appeared\r\nprobable that it would not produce this effect on Indian corn, which, in\r\nchemical composition, is very similar to wheat. The result shows how\r\nuncertain are all speculations in regard to the manurial requirements of\r\nplants. This immediate effect of superphosphate of lime on corn was so\r\nmarked, that the men (who were, at the time of planting, somewhat\r\ninclined to be skeptical, in regard to the value of such small doses of\r\nmanure), declared that ‘superphosphate beats all creation for corn.’ The\r\ndifference in favor of superphosphate, at the time of hoeing, was very\r\nperceptible, even at some distance.\r\n\r\n“Although every precaution was taken that was deemed necessary, to\r\nprevent the manures from mixing in the hill, or from injuring the seed,\r\nyet, it was found, that those plots dressed with ashes and guano, or\r\nwith ashes and sulphate of ammonia, were injured to some extent. Shortly\r\nafter the corn was planted, heavy rain set in, and washed the sulphate\r\nof ammonia and guano, down into the ashes, and mutual decomposition took\r\nplace, with more or less loss of ammonia. In addition to this loss of\r\nammonia, these manures came up to the surface of the ground in the form\r\nof an excrescence, so hard that the plants could with difficulty\r\npenetrate through it.\r\n\r\n“It will be seen, by examining the table, that although the\r\nsuperphosphate of lime had a good effect during the early stages of the\r\ngrowth of the plants, yet the increase of ears of corn in the end did\r\nnot come up to these early indications. On plot 5, with 300 lbs. of\r\nsuperphosphate of lime per acre, the yield is precisely the same as on\r\nplot 2, with 100 lbs. of plaster (_sulphate of lime_), per acre. Now,\r\nsuperphosphate of lime is composed necessarily of soluble phosphate of\r\nlime and plaster, or sulphate of lime, formed from a combination of the\r\nsulphuric acid, employed in the manufacture of superphosphate, with the\r\nlime of the bones. In the 300 lbs. of superphosphate of lime, sown on\r\nplot 5, there would be about 100 lbs. of plaster; and as the effect of\r\nthis dressing is no greater than was obtained from the 100 lbs. of\r\nplaster, sown on plot 2, it follows, that the good effect of the\r\nsuperphosphate of lime was due to the plaster that it contained.\r\n\r\n“Again, on plot 4, with 150 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia per acre, we\r\nhave 90 bushels of ears of sound corn, and 15 bushels of ears of soft\r\ncorn, (‘nubbins,’) per acre; or a total increase over the plot without\r\nmanure, of 38 bushels. Now, the sulphate of ammonia contains no\r\nphosphate of lime, and the fact that such a manure gives a considerable\r\nincrease of crop, confirms the conclusion we have arrived at, from a\r\ncomparison of the results on plots 2 and 5; that the increase from the\r\nsuperphosphate of lime, is not due to the phosphate of lime which it\r\ncontains, unless we are to conclude that the sulphate of ammonia\r\nrendered the phosphate of lime in the soil more readily soluble, and\r\nthus furnished an increased quantity in an available form for\r\nassimilation by the plants--a conclusion, which the results with\r\nsuperphosphate alone, on plot 5, and with superphosphate and sulphate of\r\nammonia, combined, on plot 6, do not sustain.\r\n\r\n“On plot 12, half the quantity of sulphate of ammonia, was used as on\r\nplot 4, and the increase is a little more than half what it is where\r\ndouble the quantity was used. Again, on plot 13, 200 lbs. of Peruvian\r\nguano per acre, gives nearly as great an increase of sound corn, as the\r\n150 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia. Now, 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano\r\ncontains nearly as much ammonia as 150 lbs. sulphate of ammonia, and the\r\nincrease in both cases is evidently due to the ammonia of these manures.\r\nThe 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano, contained about 50 lbs. of phosphate of\r\nlime; but as the sulphate of ammonia, which contains no phosphate of\r\nlime, gives as great an increase as the guano, it follows, that the\r\nphosphate of lime in the guano, had little, if any effect; a result\r\nprecisely similar to that obtained with superphosphate of lime.\r\n\r\n“We may conclude, therefore, that on this soil, which has never been\r\nmanured, and which has been cultivated for many years with the\r\n_Ceralia_--or, in other words, with crops which remove a large quantity\r\nof phosphate of lime from the soil--the phosphate of lime, relatively to\r\nthe ammonia, is not deficient. If such was not the case, an application\r\nof soluble phosphate of lime would have given an increase of crop, which\r\nwe have shown was not the case in any one of these experiments.\r\n\r\n“Plot 10, with 400 lbs. of unleached wood-ashes per acre, produces the\r\nsame quantity of _sound corn_, with an extra bushel of ‘nubbins’ per\r\nacre, as plot 1, without any manure at all; ashes, therefore, applied\r\nalone, may be said to have had no effect whatever. On plot 3, 400 lbs.\r\nof ashes, and 100 lbs. of plaster, give the same total number of bushels\r\nper acre, as plot 2, with 100 lbs. of plaster alone. Plot 8, with 400\r\nlbs. ashes, and 150 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia, yields three bushels of\r\nsound corn, and five bushels of ‘nubbins’ per acre, _less_ than plot 4,\r\nwith 150 lbs. sulphate of ammonia alone. This result may be ascribed to\r\nthe fact previously alluded to--the ashes dissipated some of the\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\n“Plot 11, with 100 lbs. of plaster, 400 lbs. ashes, 300 lbs. of\r\nsuperphosphate of lime, and 200 lbs. Peruvian guano (which contains\r\nabout as much ammonia as 150 lbs. sulphate of ammonia), produced\r\nprecisely the same number of total bushels per acre, as plot 4, with 150\r\nlbs. sulphate of ammonia alone, and but 4 bushels more per acre, than\r\nplot 13, with 200 lbs. Peruvian guano alone. It is evident, from these\r\nresults, that neither ashes nor phosphates had much effect on Indian\r\ncorn, on this impoverished soil. Plot 14 received the largest dressing\r\nof ammonia (500 lbs. Peruvian guano), and produced much the largest\r\ncrop; though the increase is not so great in proportion to the guano, as\r\nwhere smaller quantities were used.\r\n\r\n“The manure which produced the most profitable result, was the 100 lbs.\r\nof plaster, on plot 2. The 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano, on plot 13, and\r\nwhich cost about $6, gave an increase of 14 bushels of shelled corn, and\r\n6 bushels of ‘nubbins.’ This will pay at the present price of corn in\r\nRochester, although the profit is not very great. The superphosphate of\r\nlime, although a very superior article, and estimated at cost price, in\r\nno case paid for itself. The same is true of the ashes.\r\n\r\n“But the object of the experiment was not so much to ascertain what\r\nmanures will pay, but to ascertain, if possible, what constituents of\r\nmanures are required, in greatest quantity, for the maximum growth of\r\ncorn.  *  *  Hitherto, no experiments have been made in this country, on\r\nIndian corn, that afforded any certain information on this point.\r\nIndeed, we believe no satisfactory experiments have been made on Indian\r\ncorn, in any country, that throw any definite light on this interesting\r\nand important question. A few years ago, Mr. Lawes made similar\r\nexperiments to those given above, on his farm, at Rothamsted, England;\r\nbut owing to the coolness of the English climate, the crop did not\r\narrive at maturity.\r\n\r\n“Numerous experiments have been made in this country, with guano and\r\nsuperphosphate of lime; but the superphosphates used were commercial\r\narticles, containing more or less ammonia, and if they are of any\r\nbenefit to those crops to which they are applied, it is a matter of\r\nuncertainty whether the beneficial effect of the application is due to\r\nthe soluble phosphate of lime, or to the ammonia. On the other hand,\r\nguano contains both ammonia and phosphate; and we are equally at a loss\r\nto determine, whether the effect is attributable to the ammonia or\r\nphosphate, or both. In order, therefore, to determine satisfactorily,\r\nwhich of the several ingredients of plants is required in greatest\r\nproportion, for the maximum growth of any particular crop, we must apply\r\nthese ingredients separately, or in such definite compounds, as will\r\nenable us to determine to what particular element or compounds the\r\nbeneficial effect is to be ascribed. It was for this reason, that\r\nsulphate of ammonia, and a purely mineral superphosphate of lime, were\r\nused in the above experiments. No one would think of using sulphate of\r\nammonia at its price, [sulphate of ammonia is now cheaper, while\r\nPeruvian guano is more costly and less rich in ammonia], as an ordinary\r\nmanure, for the reason, that the same quantity of ammonia can be\r\nobtained in other substances, such as barnyard-manure, Peruvian guano,\r\netc., at a much cheaper rate. But these manures contain _all_ the\r\nelements of plants, and we can not know whether the effect produced by\r\nthem is due to the ammonia, phosphates, or any other ingredients. For\r\nthe purpose of experiment, therefore, we must use a manure that\r\nfurnishes ammonia without any admixture of phosphates, potash, soda,\r\nlime, magnesia, etc., even though it cost much more than we could obtain\r\nthe same amount of ammonia in other manures. I make these remarks in\r\norder to correct a very common opinion, that if experiments do not\r\n_pay_, they are useless. The ultimate object, indeed, is to ascertain\r\nthe most profitable method of manuring; but the _means_ of obtaining\r\nthis information, can not in all cases be profitable.\r\n\r\n“Similar experiments to those made on Indian corn, were made on soil of\r\na similar character, on about an acre of Chinese sugar-cane. I do not\r\npropose to give the results in detail, at this time, and allude to them\r\nmerely to mention one very important fact, _the superphosphate of lime\r\nhad a very marked effect_. This manure was applied in the hill on one\r\nplot (the twentieth of an acre,) at the rate of 400 lbs. per acre, and\r\nthe plants on this plot came up first, and outgrew all the others from\r\nthe start, and ultimately attained the height of about ten feet; while\r\non the plot receiving no manure, the plants were not five feet high.\r\nThis is a result entirely different from what I should have expected. It\r\nhas been supposed, from the fact that superphosphate of lime had no\r\neffect on wheat, that it would probably have little effect on corn, or\r\non the sugar-cane, or other _ceralia_; and that, as ammonia is so\r\nbeneficial for wheat, it would probably be beneficial for corn and\r\nsugar-cane. The above experiments indicate that such is the case, in\r\nregard to Indian corn, so far as the production of grain is concerned,\r\nthough, as we have stated, it is not true in reference to the early\r\ngrowth of the plants. The superphosphate of lime on Indian corn,\r\nstimulated the growth of the plants, in a very decided manner at first,\r\nso much so, that we were led to suppose, for some time, that it would\r\ngive the largest crop; but at harvest, it was found that it produced no\r\nmore corn than plaster. These results seem to indicate, that\r\nsuperphosphate of lime stimulates the growth of stalks and leaves, and\r\nhas little effect in increasing the production of seed. In raising\r\nIndian corn, for fodder or for soiling purposes, superphosphate of lime\r\nmay be beneficial, as well as in growing the sorghum for sugar-making\r\npurposes, or for fodder--though, perhaps, not for seed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“In addition to the experiments given above, I also made the same\r\nseason, on an adjoining field, another set of experiments on Indian\r\ncorn, the results of which are given below.\r\n\r\n“The land on which these experiments were made, is of a somewhat firmer\r\ntexture than that on which the other set of experiments was made. It is\r\nsituated about a mile from the barn-yard, and on this account, has\r\nseldom, if ever been manured. It has been cultivated for many years with\r\nordinary farm crops. It was plowed early in the spring, and it was\r\nharrowed until quite mellow. The corn was planted May 30, 1857. Each\r\nexperiment occupied one-tenth of an acre, consisting of 4 rows 3½ feet\r\napart, and the same distance between the hills in the rows, with one row\r\nwithout manure between each experimental plot.\r\n\r\n“The manure was applied in the hill, in the same manner as in the first\r\nset of experiments.\r\n\r\n“The barnyard-manure was well-rotted, and consisted principally of\r\ncow-dung with a little horse-dung. Twenty two-horse wagon loads of this\r\nwas applied per acre, and each load would probably weigh about one ton.\r\nIt was put in the hill and covered with soil, and the seed then planted\r\non the top.\r\n\r\n“The following table gives the results of the experiments:\r\n\r\n  Table Showing the Results of Experiments on Indian Corn, Made Near\r\n  Rochester, N.Y., in the Year 1857.\r\n\r\nSdC  Bushels of ears of sound corn per acre.\r\nSfC  Bushels of ears of soft corn per acre.\r\nTC   Total No. of bushels of ears of corn per acre.\r\nISdC Increase per acre of ears sound corn.\r\nISfC Increase per acre of ears of soft corn.\r\nTIC  Total increase per acre of ears of corn.\r\n\r\n-----+----------------------------------+-----+----+-----+----+----+----\r\n     |   Descriptions of manures and    |     |    |     |    |    |\r\nPlots|   quantities applied per acre    | SdC | SfC|  TC |ISdC|ISfC|TIC\r\n-----+----------------------------------+-----+----+-----+----+----+----\r\n  1. | No manure                        | 75  | 12 |  87 | .. | .. | ..\r\n  2. | 20 loads barn-yard manure        | 82½ | 10 |  92½| 5½ | .. |  5½\r\n  3. | 150 lbs. sulphate of ammonia     | 85  | 30 | 115 | 10 | 18 | 28\r\n  4. | 300 lbs. superphosphate of lime  | 88  | 10 |  98 | 11 | .. | 11\r\n  5. | 400 lbs.

The 400 lbs. of ‘Cancerine’--an artificial manure made in\r\nNew Jersey from fish--gives a total increase of 18 bushels of ears per\r\nacre over the unmanured plot, and 12½ bushels more than that manured\r\nwith barn-yard dung, though 5 bushels of ears of sound corn and 10\r\nbushels of ‘nubbins’ per acre _less_ than the same quantity of Peruvian\r\nguano.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR TURNIPS.\r\n\r\nTo raise a large crop of turnips, especially of ruta-bagas, there is\r\nnothing better than a liberal application of rich, well-rotted\r\nfarm-yard-manure, and 250 to 300 lbs. of good superphosphate of lime per\r\nacre, _drilled in with the seed_.\r\n\r\nI have seen capital crops of common turnips grown with no other manure\r\nexcept 300 lbs. of superphosphate per acre, drilled with the seed.\r\nSuperphosphate has a wonderful effect on the development of the roots of\r\nthe turnip. And this is the secret of its great value for this crop. It\r\nincreases the growth of the young plant, developing the formation of the\r\nroots, and when the turnip once gets full possession of the soil, it\r\nappropriates all the plant-food it can find. A turnip-crop grown with\r\nsuperphosphate, can get from the soil much more nitrogen than a crop of\r\nwheat. The turnip-crop, when supplied with superphosphate, is a good\r\n“scavenger.” It will gather up and organize into good food the refuse\r\nplant-food left in the soil. It is to the surface soil, what clover is\r\nto the subsoil. To the market gardener, or to a farmer who manures\r\nheavily common turnips drilled in with superphosphate will prove a\r\nvaluable crop. On such land no other manure will be needed. I cannot too\r\nearnestly recommend the use of superphosphate as a manure for turnips.\r\n\r\nFor Swede turnips or ruta-bagas, it will usually be necessary, in order\r\nto secure a maximum crop, to use a manure which, in addition to\r\nsuperphosphate, contains available nitrogen. A good dressing of rich,\r\nwell-rotted manure, spread on the land, and plowed under, and then 300\r\nlbs. of superphosphate drilled in with the seed, would be likely to give\r\na good crop.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of manure, there is probably nothing better for the\r\nruta-bagas than 300 lbs. of so-called “rectified” Peruvian guano, that\r\nis, guano treated with sulphuric acid, to render the phosphates soluble.\r\nSuch a guano is guaranteed to contain 10 per cent of ammonia, and 10 per\r\ncent of soluble phosphoric acid, and would be a good dressing for Swede\r\nturnips.\r\n\r\nThe best way to use guano for turnips is to sow it broadcast on the\r\nland, and harrow it in, and then either drill in the turnip-seed on the\r\nflat, or on ridges. The latter is decidedly the better plan, provided\r\nyou have the necessary implements to do the work expeditiously. A double\r\nmould-board plow will ridge up four acres a day, and the guano being\r\npreviously sown on the surface, will be turned up with the mellow\r\nsurface-soil into the ridge, where the seed is to be sown. The young\r\nplants get hold of it and grow so rapidly as to be soon out of danger\r\nfrom the turnip-beetle.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR MANGEL-WURZEL OR SUGAR-BEETS.\r\n\r\nWhen sugar-beets are grown for feeding to stock, there is probably\r\nlittle or no difference in the manurial requirements of sugar-beets and\r\nmangel-wurzel. Our object is to get as large a growth as possible\r\nconsistent with quality.\r\n\r\n“Large roots,” said the Deacon, “have been proved to contain less\r\nnutriment than small roots.”\r\n\r\nTrue, but it does not follow from this that rich land, or heavy manuring\r\nis the chief cause of this difference. It is much more likely to be due\r\nto the variety selected. The seed-growers have been breeding solely for\r\nsize and shape. They have succeeded to such an extent that 84 gross tons\r\nof roots have been grown on an acre. This is equal to over 94 of our\r\ntons per acre. “That is an enormous crop,” said the Deacon; “and it\r\nwould require some labor to put 10 acres of them in a cellar.”\r\n\r\n“If they were as nutritious as ordinary mangels,” said I, “that would be\r\nno argument against them. But such is not the case. In a letter just\r\nreceived from Mr. Lawes, (May, 1878,) he characterizes them as ‘bladders\r\nof water and salts.’”\r\n\r\nHad the seed-growers bred for _quality_, the roots would have been of\r\nless size, but they would contain more nutriment.\r\n\r\nWhat we want is a variety that has been bred with reference to quality;\r\nand when this is secured, we need not fear to make the land rich and\r\notherwise aim to secure great growth and large-sized roots.\r\n\r\nIt certainly is not good economy to select a variety which has been bred\r\nfor years to produce large-sized roots, and then sow this seed on poor\r\nland for the purpose of obtaining small-sized roots. Better take a\r\nvariety bred for quality, and then make the land rich enough to produce\r\na good crop.\r\n\r\nWe are not likely to err in making the land too rich for mangel-wurzel\r\nor for sugar-beets grown for stock. When sugar-beets are grown for\r\nsugar, we must aim to use manures favorable for the production of sugar,\r\nor rather to avoid using those which are unfavorable. But where\r\nsugar-beets are grown for food, our aim is to get a large amount of\r\nnutriment to the acre. And it is by no means clear to my mind that there\r\nis much to be gained by selecting the sugar-beet instead of a good\r\nvariety of mangel-wurzel. It is not a difficult matter, by selecting the\r\nlargest roots for seed, and by liberal manuring, and continuously\r\nselecting the largest roots, to convert the sugar-beet into a\r\nmangel-wurzel.\r\n\r\nWhen sugar-beets are grown for food, we may safely manure them as we\r\nwould mangel-wurzel, and treat the two crops precisely alike.\r\n\r\nI usually raise from ten to fifteen acres of mangel-wurzel every year.\r\nI grow them in rotation with other crops, and not as the Hon. Harris\r\nLewis and some others do, continuously on the same land. We manure\r\nliberally, but not extravagantly, and get a fair yield, and the land is\r\nleft in admirable condition for future crops.\r\n\r\nI mean by this, not that the land is specially rich, but that it is very\r\nclean and mellow.\r\n\r\n“In 1877,” said the Deacon, “you had potatoes on the land where you grew\r\nmangels the previous year, and had the best crop in the neighborhood.”\r\n\r\nThis is true, but still I do not think it a good rotation. A barley crop\r\nseeded with clover would be better, especially if the mangels were\r\nheavily manured. The clover would get the manure which had been washed\r\ninto the subsoil, or left in such a condition that potatoes or grain\r\ncould not take it up.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing in relation to my mangels of 1876 which has escaped\r\nthe Deacon. The whole piece was manured and well prepared, and dibbled\r\nin with mangels, the rows being 2½ feet apart, and the seed dropped 15\r\ninches apart in the rows. Owing to poor seed, the mangels failed on\r\nabout three acres, and we plowed up the land and drilled in corn for\r\nfodder, in rows 2½ feet apart, and at the rate of over three bushels of\r\nseed per acre. We had a _great crop_ of corn-fodder.\r\n\r\nThe next year, as I said before, the whole piece was planted with\r\npotatoes, and if it was true that mangels are an “enriching crop,” while\r\ncorn is an “exhausting” crop, we ought to have had much better potatoes\r\nafter the mangels than after corn. This was certainly not the case; if\r\nthere was any difference, it was in favor of the corn. But I do not\r\nplace any confidence in an experiment of this kind, where the crops were\r\nnot weighed and the results carefully ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Lawes has made some most thorough experiments with different manures\r\non sugar-beets, and in 1876 he commenced a series of experiments with\r\nmangel-wurzel.\r\n\r\nThe land is a rather stiff clay loam, similar to that on which the wheat\r\nand barley experiments were made. It is better suited to the growth of\r\nbeets than of turnips.\r\n\r\n“Why so,” asked the Deacon, “I thought that black, bottom land was best\r\nfor mangels.”\r\n\r\n“Not so, Deacon,” said I, “we can, it is true, grow large crops of\r\nmangels on well-drained and well-manured swampy or bottom land, but the\r\nbest soil for mangels, especially in regard to quality, is a good,\r\nstiff, well-worked, and well-manured loam.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said the Deacon, “you had a better crop last year on the\r\nlower and blacker portions of the field than on the heavy, clayey land.”\r\n\r\nIn one sense, this is true. We had dry weather in the spring, and the\r\nmangel seed on the dry, clayey land did not come up as well as on the\r\ncooler and moister bottom-land. We had more plants to the acre, but the\r\nroots on the clayey land, when they once got fair hold of the soil and\r\nthe manure, grew larger and better than on the lighter and moister land.\r\nThe great point is to get this heavy land into a fine, mellow condition.\r\n\r\nBut to Mr. Lawes’ experiments. They are remarkably interesting and\r\ninstructive. But it is not necessary to go into all the details. Suffice\r\nit to say that the experiments seem to prove, very conclusively, that\r\nbeets require a liberal supply of available nitrogen. Thus, without\r\nmanure, the yield of beets was about 7½ tons of bulbs per acre.\r\n\r\nWith 550 lbs. nitrate of soda per acre, the yield was a little over 22\r\ntons per acre. With 14 tons of farmyard-manure, 18 tons per acre. With\r\n14 tons of farmyard manure and 550 lbs. nitrate of soda, over 27½ tons\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\nSuperphosphate of lime, sulphates of potash, soda, and magnesia, and\r\ncommon salt, alone, or with other manures, had comparatively little\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nPractically, when we want to grow a good crop of beets or mangels, these\r\nexperiments prove that what we need is the richest kind of\r\nbarnyard-manure.\r\n\r\nIf our manure is not rich, then we should use, in addition to the\r\nmanure, a dressing of nitrate of soda--say 400 or 500 lbs. per acre.\r\n\r\nIf the land is in pretty good condition, and we have no barnyard-manure,\r\nwe may look for a fair crop from a dressing of nitrate of soda alone.\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the Deacon, “that 550 lbs. of nitrate of soda alone, gave\r\nan increase of 14½ tons per acre. And the following year, on the same\r\nland, it gave an increase of 13½ tons; and the next year, on the same\r\nland, over 9 tons.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “the first three years of the experiments (1871-2-3), 550\r\nlbs. of nitrate of soda alone, applied every year, gave an average yield\r\nof 19¼ tons of bulbs per acre. During the same three years, the plot\r\ndressed with 14 tons of barnyard-manure, gave an average yield of 16¼\r\ntons. But now mark. The next year (1874) all the plots were left without\r\nany manure, and the plot which had been previously dressed with nitrate\r\nof soda, alone, fell off to 3 tons per acre, while the plot which had\r\nbeen previously manured with barnyard-manure, produced 10¾ tons per\r\nacre.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the Deacon, “there is nothing like manure.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR CABBAGE, PARSNIPS, CARROTS, LETTUCE, ONIONS, ETC.\r\n\r\nI class these plants together, because, though differing widely in many\r\nrespects, they have one feature in common. They are all artificial\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nA distinguished amateur horticulturist once said to me, “I do not see\r\nwhy it is I have so much trouble with lettuce. My land is rich, and the\r\nlettuce grow well, but do not head. They have a tendency to run up to\r\nseed, and soon get tough and bitter.”\r\n\r\nI advised him to raise his own seed from the best plants--and especially\r\nto reject all plants that showed any tendency to go prematurely to seed.\r\nFurthermore, I told him I thought if he would sow a little\r\nsuperphosphate of lime with the seed, it would greatly stimulate the\r\n_early_ growth of the lettuce.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, superphosphate, when drilled in with the seed,\r\nhas a wonderful effect in developing the root-growth of the young plants\r\nof turnips, and I thought it would have the same effect on lettuce,\r\ncabbage, cauliflowers, etc.\r\n\r\n“But,” said he, “it is not _roots_ that I want, but heads.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said I, “you do not want the plants to follow out their\r\nnatural disposition and run up to seed. You want to induce them to throw\r\nout a great abundance of tender leaves. In other words, you want them to\r\n‘head.’ Just as in the turnip, you do not want them to run up to seed,\r\nbut to produce an unnatural development of ‘bulb.’”\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, Dr. Gilbert threw out the suggestion, that while it\r\nwas evident that turnips required a larger proportion of soluble\r\nphosphates in the soil than wheat; while wheat required a larger\r\nproportion of available nitrogen in the soil, than turnips, it was quite\r\nprobable, if we were growing turnips _for seed_, that then, turnips\r\nwould require the same kind of manures as wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want exceedingly rich land for cabbage, especially for an early crop.\r\nThis is not merely because a large crop of cabbage takes a large amount\r\nof plant-food out of the soil, but because the cultivated cabbage is an\r\nartificial plant, that requires its food in a concentrated shape. In\r\npopular language, the plants have to be “forced.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the analyses of Dr. Anderson, the outside leaves of\r\ncabbage, contain, in round numbers, 91 per cent of water; and the heart\r\nleaves, 94½ per cent. In other words, the green leaves contain 3½ per\r\ncent more dry matter than the heart leaves.\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker, who analyzed more recently some “cattle-cabbage,” found 89½\r\nper cent of water in the green leaves, and 83¾ per cent in the heart and\r\ninner leaves--thus confirming previous analyses, and showing also that\r\nthe composition of cabbages varies considerably.\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker found much less water in the cabbage than Dr. Anderson.\r\n\r\nThe specimen analyzed by Dr. V., was grown on the farm of the Royal Ag.\r\nCollege of England, and I infer from some incidental remarks, that the\r\ncrop was grown on rather poor land. And it is probably true that a large\r\ncrop of cabbage grown on rich land, contains a higher percentage of\r\nwater than cabbage grown on poorer land. On the poor land, the cabbage\r\nwould not be likely to head so well as on the rich land, and the green\r\nleaves of cabbage contain more than half as much again real dry\r\nsubstance as the heart leaves.\r\n\r\nThe dry matter of the heart leaves, however, contains more actual\r\nnutriment than the dry matter of the green leaves.\r\n\r\nIt would seem very desirable, therefore, whether we are raising cabbage\r\nfor market or for home consumption, to make the land rich enough to grow\r\ngood heads. Dr. Vœlcker says, “In ordinary seasons, the average produce\r\nof Swedes on our poorer fields is about 15 tons per acre. On weighing\r\nthe produce of an acre of cabbage, grown under similar circumstances,\r\nI found that it amounted to 17½ tons per acre. On good, well-manured\r\nfields, however, we have had a much larger produce.”\r\n\r\nIn a report on the “Cultivation of Cabbage, and its comparative Value\r\nfor Feeding purposes,” by J. M. M’Laren, of Scotland, the yield of Swede\r\nturnips, was 29¾ tons per acre, and the yield of cabbage, 47¾ tons per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n“It is very evident,” said the Deacon, “that if you grow cabbage you\r\nshould make the land rich enough to produce a good crop--and I take it\r\nthat is all you want to show.”\r\n\r\n“I want to show,” I replied, “that our market gardeners have reason for\r\napplying such apparently excessive dressings of rich manure to the\r\ncabbage-crop. They find it safer to put far more manure into the land\r\nthan the crop can possibly use, rather than run any risk of getting an\r\ninferior crop. An important practical question is, whether they can not\r\ngrow some crop or crops after the cabbage, that can profitably take up\r\nthe manure left in the soil.”\r\n\r\nProf. E. Wolff, in the last edition of “Praktische Düngerlehre,” gives\r\nthe composition of cabbage. For the details of which, see Appendix, page\r\n345.\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that 50 tons of cabbage contain 240 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen, and 1,600 lbs. of ash. Included in the ash is 630 lbs. of\r\npotash; 90 lbs. of soda; 310 lbs. of lime; 60 lbs. of magnesia; 140 lbs.\r\nof phosphoric acid; 240 lbs. of sulphuric acid, and 20 lbs. of silica.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenderson, in “Gardening for Profit,” advises the application of 75 tons\r\nof stable or barn-yard manure per acre, for early cabbage. For late\r\ncabbage, after peas or early potatoes, he says about 10 tons per acre\r\nare used.\r\n\r\nBrill, in “Farm Gardening and Seed Growing,” also makes the same\r\ndistinction in regard to the quantity of manure used for early and late\r\ncabbage. He speaks of 70 to 80 tons or more, per acre, of well-rotted\r\nstable-manure as not an unusual or excessive dressing every year.\r\n\r\nNow, according to Wolff’s table, 75 tons of fresh stable-manure, with\r\nstraw, contains 820 lbs. of nitrogen; 795 lbs. of potash; 150 lbs. soda;\r\n315 lbs. of lime; 210 lbs. of magnesia; 420 lbs. of phosphoric acid; 105\r\nlbs. sulphuric acid; 2,655 lbs. of silica, and 60 lbs. of chlorine.\r\n\r\n“Put the figures side by side,” said the Deacon, “so that we can compare\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nHere they are:\r\n\r\n  ------------------+--------------+-----------\r\n                    |  _75 tons    |\r\n                    | Fresh Horse  | _50 tons\r\n                    |  Manure._    |  Cabbage._\r\n  ------------------+--------------+-----------\r\n  Nitrogen          |   820 lbs.   |   240 lbs.\r\n  Potash            |   795  ”     |   630  ”\r\n  Phosphoric acid   |   420  ”     |   140  ”\r\n  Soda              |   150  ”     |    90  ”\r\n  Lime              |   315  ”     |   310  ”\r\n  Magnesia          |   210  ”     |    60  ”\r\n  ------------------+--------------+-----------\r\n\r\n“That is rather an interesting table,” said the Doctor. “In the case of\r\nlime, the crop takes about all that this heavy dressing of manure\r\nsupplies--but I suppose the soil is usually capable of furnishing a\r\nconsiderable quantity.”\r\n\r\n“That may be so,” said the Deacon, “but all the authorities on market\r\ngardening speak of the importance of either growing cabbage on land\r\ncontaining lime, or else of applying lime as a manure. Quinn, who writes\r\nlike a sensible man, says in his book, ‘Money in the Garden,’ ‘A\r\ntop-dressing of lime every third year, thirty or forty bushels per acre,\r\nspread broadcast, and harrowed in, just before planting, pays\r\nhandsomely.’”\r\n\r\nHenderson thinks cabbage can only be grown successfully on land\r\ncontaining abundance of lime. He has used heavy dressings of lime on\r\nland which did not contain shells, and the result was satisfactory for a\r\ntime, but he found it too expensive.\r\n\r\nExperience seems to show that to grow large crops of perfect cabbage,\r\nthe soil must be liberally furnished with manures rich in nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nIn saying this, I do not overlook the fact that cabbage require a large\r\nquantity of potash. I think, however, that when large quantities of\r\nstable or barn-yard manure is used, it will rarely be found that the\r\nsoil lacks potash.\r\n\r\nWhat we need to grow a large crop of cabbage, is manure from well-fed\r\nanimals. Such manure can rarely be purchased. Now, the difference\r\nbetween rich manure and ordinary stable or barnyard-manure, consists\r\nprincipally in this: The rich manure contains more nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid than the ordinary stable-manure--and it is in a more\r\navailable condition.\r\n\r\nTo convert common manure into rich manure, therefore, we must add\r\nnitrogen and phosphoric acid. In other words, we must use Peruvian\r\nguano, or nitrate of soda and superphosphate, or bone-dust, or some\r\nother substance that will furnish available nitrogen and phosphoric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nOr it may well be, where stable-manure can be bought for $1.00 per\r\ntwo-horse load, that it will be cheaper to use it in larger quantity\r\nrather than to try to make it rich. In this case, however, we must\r\nendeavor to follow the cabbage by some crop that has the power of taking\r\nup the large quantity of nitrogen and other plant-food that will be left\r\nin the soil.\r\n\r\nThe cabbage needs a large supply of nitrogen in the soil, but removes\r\ncomparatively little of it. We see that when 75 tons of manure is used,\r\na crop of 50 tons of cabbage takes out of the soil less than 30 per cent\r\nof the nitrogen. And yet, if you plant cabbage on this land, the next\r\nyear, without manure, you would get a small crop.\r\n\r\n“It cannot be for want of nitrogen,” said the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“Yes it can,” said I. “The cabbage, especially the early kinds, must\r\nhave in the soil a much larger quantity of available nitrogen than the\r\nplants can use.”\r\n\r\nI do not mean by this that a large crop of cabbage could be raised, year\r\nafter year, if furnished only with a large supply of available nitrogen.\r\nIn such a case, the soil would soon lack the necessary inorganic\r\ningredients. But, what I mean, is this: Where land has been heavily\r\nmanured for some years, we could often raise a good crop of cabbage by a\r\nliberal dressing of available nitrogen, and still more frequently, if\r\nnitrogen and phosphoric acid were both used.\r\n\r\nYou may use what would be considered an excessive quantity of ordinary\r\nstable-manure, and grow a large crop of cabbage; but still, if you plant\r\ncabbage the next year, without manure of any kind, you will get a small\r\ncrop; but dress it with a manure containing the necessary amount of\r\nnitrogen, and you will, so far as the supply of plant-food is concerned,\r\nbe likely to get a good crop.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances, I think an application of 800 lbs. of nitrate of\r\nsoda per acre, costing, say $32, would be likely to afford a very\r\nhandsome profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor lettuce, in addition to well prepared rich land, I should sow\r\n3 lbs. of superphosphate to each square rod, scattered in the rows\r\nbefore drilling in the seed. It will favor the formation of fibrous\r\nroots and stimulate the growth of the young plants.\r\n\r\nIn raising onions from seed, we require an abundance of rich,\r\nwell-rotted manure, clean land, and early sowing.\r\n\r\nOnions are often raised year after year on the same land. That this\r\nentails a great waste of manure, is highly probable, but it is not an\r\neasy matter to get ordinary farm-land properly prepared for onions. It\r\nneeds to be clean and free from stones and rubbish of all kinds, and\r\nwhen once it is in good condition, it is thought better to continue it\r\nin onions, even though it may entail more or less loss of fertility.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean,” asked the Deacon, “by loss of manure?”\r\n\r\n“Simply this,” said I. “We use a far greater amount of plant-food in the\r\nshape of manure than is removed by the crop of onions. And yet,\r\nnotwithstanding this fact, it is found, as a matter of experience, that\r\nit is absolutely necessary, if we would raise a large and profitable\r\ncrop, to manure it every year.”\r\n\r\nA few experiments would throw much light on this matter. I should\r\nexpect, when land had been heavily dressed every year for a few years,\r\nwith stable-manure, and annually sown to onions, that 800 lbs. of\r\nsulphate of ammonia, or of nitrate of soda, or 1,200 lbs. of Peruvian\r\nguano would give as good a crop as 25 or 30 tons of manure. Or perhaps a\r\nbetter plan would be to apply 10 or 15 loads of manure, and 600 lbs. of\r\nguano, or 400 lbs. sulphate of ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR GARDENS AND ORCHARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURE FOR MARKET-GARDENS.\r\n\r\nThe chief dependence of the market gardener must be on the stable-manure\r\nwhich he can obtain from the city or village. The chief defect of this\r\nmanure is that it is not rich enough in available nitrogen. The active\r\nnitrogen exists principally in the urine, and this in our city stables\r\nis largely lost. A ton of fresh, unmixed horse-dung contains about 9\r\nlbs. of nitrogen. A ton of horse-urine, 31 lbs. But this does not tell\r\nthe whole story. The nitrogen in the dung is contained in the crude,\r\nundigested portions of the food. It is to a large extent insoluble and\r\nunavailable, while the nitrogen in the urine is soluble and active.\r\n\r\nThe market-gardener, of course, has to take such manure as he can get,\r\nand the only points to be considered are (1), whether he had better\r\ncontinue to use an excessive quantity of the manure, or (2), to buy\r\nsubstances rich in available nitrogen, and either mix them with the\r\nmanure, or apply them separately to the soil, or (3), whether he can use\r\nthis horse-manure as bedding for pigs to be fed on rich nitrogenous\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe latter plan I adopt on my own farm, and in this way I get a very\r\nrich and active manure. I get available nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and\r\npotash, at far cheaper rates than they can be purchased in the best\r\ncommercial fertilizers.\r\n\r\nPigs void a large amount of urine, and as pigs are ordinarily kept, much\r\nof this liquid is lost for want of sufficient bedding to absorb it. With\r\nthe market-gardener or nurseryman, who draws large quantities of\r\nhorse-manure from the city, this need not be the case. The necessary\r\nbuildings can be constructed at little cost, and the horse-manure can be\r\nused freely. The pigs should be fed on food rich in nitrogen, such as\r\nbran, malt-combs, brewers’ grains, the refuse animal matter from the\r\nslaughter-houses or butchers’ stores, fish scrap, pea or lentil-meal,\r\npalm-nut cake, or such food as will furnish the most nitrogenous food,\r\nother things being equal, at the cheapest rate.\r\n\r\nThe market-gardener not only requires large quantities of rich manure,\r\nbut he wants them to act quickly. The nurseryman who sets out a block of\r\ntrees which will occupy the ground for three, four, or five years, may\r\nwant a “lasting manure,” but such is not the case with the gardener who\r\ngrows crops which he takes off the land in a few months. As long as he\r\ncontinues to use horse or cow-manure freely, he need not trouble himself\r\nto get a slow or lasting manure. His great aim should be to make the\r\nmanure as active and available as possible. And this is especially the\r\ncase if he occupies clayey or loamy land. On sandy land the manure will\r\ndecompose more rapidly and act quicker.\r\n\r\n“There are many facts,” said the Doctor, “that show that an artificial\r\napplication of water is equivalent to an application of manure. It has\r\nbeen shown that market-gardeners find it necessary to apply a much\r\nlarger amount of plant-food to the soil than the crops can take up. This\r\nthey have to do year after year. And it may well be that, when a supply\r\nof water can be had at slight cost, it will be cheaper to irrigate the\r\nland, or water the plants, rather than to furnish such an excess of\r\nmanure, as is now found necessary. Even with ordinary farm-crops, we\r\nknow that they feel the effects of drouth far less on rich land than on\r\npoor land. In other words, a liberal supply of plant-food enables the\r\ncrops to flourish with less water; and, on the other hand, a greater\r\nsupply of water will enable the crops to flourish with a less supply of\r\nplant-food. The market-gardeners should look into this question of\r\nirrigation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURES FOR SEED-GROWING FARMS.\r\n\r\nIn growing garden and vegetable seeds, much labor is necessarily\r\nemployed per acre, and consequently it is of great importance to produce\r\na good yield. The best and cleanest land is necessary to start with, and\r\nthen manures must be appropriately and freely used.\r\n\r\n“But not too freely,” said the Doctor, “for I am told it is quite\r\npossible to have land too rich for seed-growing.”\r\n\r\nIt is not often that the land is too rich. Still, it may well be that\r\nfor some crops too much stable-manure is used. But in nine cases out of\r\nten, when such manure gives too much growth and too little or too poor\r\nseed, the trouble is in the quality of the manure. It contains too much\r\ncarbonaceous matter. In other words, it is so poor in nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid, that an excessive quantity has to be used.\r\n\r\nThe remedy consists in making richer manures and using a less quantity,\r\nor use half the quantity of stable-manure, and apply the rectified or\r\nprepared Peruvian guano, at the rate of 300 lbs. or 400 lbs. per acre,\r\nor say 200 lbs. superphosphate and 200 lbs. nitrate of soda per acre.\r\n\r\nWhere it is very important to have the seeds ripen early, a liberal\r\ndressing, say 400 lbs. per acre, of superphosphate of lime, will be\r\nlikely to prove beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURE FOR PRIVATE GARDENS.\r\n\r\nI once had a small garden in the city, and having no manure, I depended\r\nentirely on thorough cultivation and artificial fertilizers, such as\r\nsuperphosphate and sulphate of ammonia. It was cultivated not for\r\nprofit, but for pleasure, but I never saw a more productive piece of\r\nland. I had in almost every case two crops a year on the same land, and\r\non some plots three crops. No manure was used, except the superphosphate\r\nand sulphate of ammonia, and coal and wood ashes from the house.\r\n\r\nAbout 5 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia was sown broadcast to the square\r\nrod, or worked into the soil very thoroughly in the rows where the seed\r\nwas to be sown. Superphosphate was applied at the same rate, but instead\r\nof sowing it broadcast, I aimed to get it as near the seed or the roots\r\nof plants as possible.\r\n\r\nHalf a teaspoonful of the mixture, consisting of equal parts of\r\nsuperphosphate and sulphate of ammonia, stirred into a large three\r\ngallon can of water, and sprinkled on to a bed of verbenas, seemed to\r\nhave a remarkable effect on the size and brilliancy of the flowers.\r\n\r\nEven to this day, although I have a good supply of rich barnyard-manure,\r\nI do not like to be without some good artificial manure for the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURE FOR HOT-BEDS.\r\n\r\nThe best manure for hot-beds is horse or sheep-dung that has been used\r\nas bedding for pigs.\r\n\r\nWhen fresh stable-manure is used, great pains should be taken to save\r\nall the urine. In other words, you want the horse-dung thoroughly\r\nsaturated with urine.\r\n\r\nThe heat is produced principally from the carbon in the manure and\r\nstraw, but you need active nitrogenous matter to start the fire. And the\r\nricher the manure is in nitrogenous matter, and the more thoroughly this\r\nis distributed through the manure, the more readily will it ferment.\r\nThere is also another advantage in having rich manure, or manure well\r\nsaturated with urine. You can make the heap more compact. Poor manure\r\nhas to be made in a loose heap, or it will not ferment; but such manure\r\nas we are talking about can be trodden down quite firm, and still\r\nferment rapid enough to give out the necessary heat, and this compact\r\nheap will continue to ferment longer and give out a steadier heat, than\r\nthe loose heap of poor manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURE FOR NURSERYMEN.\r\n\r\nOur successful nurserymen purchase large quantities of stable and other\r\nmanures from the cities, drawing it as fast as it is made, and putting\r\nit in piles until wanted. They usually turn the piles once or twice, and\r\noften three times. This favors fermentation, greatly reducing it in\r\nbulk, and rendering the manure much more soluble and active. It also\r\nmakes the manure in the heap more uniform in quality.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Ellwanger & Barry tell me that they often ferment the manure\r\nthat they draw from the stables in the city, and make it so fine and\r\nrich, that they get but one load of rotted manure from three loads as\r\ndrawn from the stables. For some crops, they use at least 20 loads of\r\nthis rotted manure per acre, and they estimate that each load of this\r\nrotted manure costs at least $5.00.\r\n\r\nH. E. Hooker places the cost of manure equally high, but seems willing\r\nto use all he can get, and does not think we can profitably employ\r\nartificial manures as a substitute.\r\n\r\nIn this I agree with him. But while I should not expect artificial\r\nmanures, when used alone, to prove as cheap or as valuable as\r\nstable-manure at present prices, I think it may well be that a little\r\nnitrate of soda, sulphate of ammonia, and superphosphate of lime, or\r\ndissolved Peruvian guano, might be used as an _auxiliary_ manure to\r\ngreat advantage.\r\n\r\nMr. H. E. Hooker, once sowed, at my suggestion, some sulphate of ammonia\r\nand superphosphate on part of a block of nursery trees, and he could not\r\nperceive that these manures did any good. Ellwanger & Barry also tried\r\nthem, and reported the same negative result. This was several years ago,\r\nand I do not think any similar experiments have been made since.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said the Deacon, “you used these self same manures on\r\nfarm-crops, and they greatly increased the growth.”\r\n\r\n“There are several reasons,” said the Doctor, “why these manures may\r\nhave failed to produce any marked effect on the nursery trees. In the\r\nfirst place, there was considerable prejudice against them, and the\r\nnurserymen would hardly feel like relying on these manures alone. They\r\nprobably sowed them on land already well manured; and I think they sowed\r\nthem too late in the season. I should like to see them fairly tried.”\r\n\r\nSo would I. It seems to me that nitrate of soda, and superphosphate, or\r\ndissolved Peruvian guano, could be used with very great advantage and\r\nprofit by the nurserymen. Of course, it would hardly be safe to depend\r\nupon them alone. They should be used either in connection with\r\nstable-manure, or on land that had previously been frequently dressed\r\nwith stable-manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURE FOR FRUIT-GROWERS.\r\n\r\nHow to keep up the fertility of our apple-orchards, is becoming an\r\nimportant question, and is attracting considerable attention.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods generally recommended--I dare not say generally\r\npractised. The one, is to keep the orchard in bare-fallow; the other, to\r\nkeep it in grass, and top-dress with manure, and either eat the grass\r\noff on the land with sheep and pigs, or else mow it frequently, and let\r\nthe grass rot on the surface, for mulch and manure.\r\n\r\n“You are speaking now,” said the Deacon, “of bearing apple-orchards. No\r\none recommends keeping a young orchard in grass. We all know that young\r\napple trees do far better when the land is occupied with corn, potatoes,\r\nbeans, or some other crop, which can be cultivated, than they do on land\r\noccupied with wheat, barley, oats, rye, buckwheat, or grass and clover.\r\nAnd even with bearing peach trees, I have seen a wonderful difference in\r\nan orchard, half of which was cultivated with corn, and the other half\r\nsown with wheat. The trees in the wheat were sickly-looking, and bore a\r\nsmall crop of inferior fruit, while the trees in the corn, grew\r\nvigorously and bore a fine crop of fruit. And the increased value of the\r\ncrop of peaches on the cultivated land was far more than we can ever\r\nhope to get from a crop of wheat.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said the Doctor, “the crop of corn on the cultivated half of\r\nthe peach-orchard removed far more plant-food from the soil, than the\r\ncrop of wheat. And so it is evident that the difference is not due\r\nwholly to the supply of manure in the surface-soil. It may well be that\r\nthe cultivation which the corn received favored the decomposition of\r\norganic matter in the soil, and the formation of nitrates, and when the\r\nrain came, it would penetrate deeper into the loose soil than on the\r\nadjoining land occupied with wheat. The rain would carry the nitrogen\r\ndown to the roots of the peach trees, and this will account for the dark\r\ngreen color of the leaves on the cultivated land, and the yellow,\r\nsickly-looking leaves on the trees among the wheat.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHEN-MANURE, AND WHAT TO DO WITH IT.\r\n\r\nA bushel of corn fed to a hen would give no more nitrogen, phosphoric\r\nacid, and potash, in the shape of manure, than a bushel of corn fed to a\r\npig. The manure from the pig, however, taking the urine and solid\r\nexcrement together, contain 82 per cent of water, while that from the\r\nhen contains only 56 per cent of water. Moreover, hens pick up worms and\r\ninsects, and their food in such case would contain more nitrogen than\r\nthe usual food of pigs, and the manure would be correspondingly richer\r\nin nitrogen. Hence it happens that 100 lbs. of _dry_ hen-manure would\r\nusually be richer in nitrogen than 100 lbs. of _dry_ pig-manure. But\r\nfeed pigs on peas, and hens on corn, and the dry pig-manure would be\r\nmuch richer in nitrogen than the dry hen-manure. The value of the\r\nmanure, other things being equal, depends on the food and not on the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nLet no man think he is going to make his farm any richer by keeping\r\nhens, ducks, and geese, than he will by keeping sheep, pigs, and horses.\r\n\r\n“Why is it, then,” asked the Deacon, “that hen-dung proves such a\r\nvaluable manure. I would rather have a hundred lbs. of hen-dung than\r\nhalf a ton of barnyard-manure?”\r\n\r\n“And I presume you are right,” said I, “but you must recollect that your\r\nhen-manure is kept until it is almost chemically dry. Let us figure up\r\nwhat the half ton of manure and the 100 lbs. of hen-manure would\r\ncontain. Here are the figures, side by side:\r\n\r\n  --------------------------+---------------+-------------\r\n                            | _100 lbs. dry | _Half ton\r\n                            |  Hen-Manure._ | Cow-Dung\r\n                            |               | with straw._\r\n  --------------------------+---------------+-------------\r\n  Water (estimated)         |   12  lbs.    |   775  lbs.\r\n  Organic Matter            |   51   ”      |   203   ”\r\n  Ash                       |   37   ”      |    22   ”\r\n                            +---------------+-------------\r\n  Nitrogen                  |    3¼  ”      |     3⅖  ”\r\n  Potash                    |    1¾  ”      |     4   ”\r\n  Lime                      |    4¾  ”      |     3   ”\r\n  Phosphoric acid           |    3   ”      |     1½  ”\r\n  --------------------------+---------------+-------------\r\n\r\nI would, myself, far rather have 100 lbs. of your dry hen-manure than\r\nhalf a ton of your farmyard-manure. Your hens are fed on richer food\r\nthan your cows. The 100 lbs. of hen-manure, too, would act much more\r\nrapidly than the half ton of cow-manure. It would probably do twice as\r\nmuch good--possibly three or four times as much good, on the first crop,\r\nas the cow-manure. The nitrogen, being obtained from richer and more\r\ndigestible food, is in a much more active and available condition than\r\nthe nitrogen in the cow-dung.\r\n\r\n“If you go on,” said the Deacon, “I think you will prove that I am\r\nright.”\r\n\r\n“I have never doubted,” said I, “the great value of hen-dung, as\r\ncompared with barnyard-manure. And all I wish to show is, that,\r\nnotwithstanding its acknowledged value, the fact remains that a given\r\nquantity of the same kind of food will give no greater amount of\r\nfertilizing matter when fed to a hen than if fed to a pig.”\r\n\r\nI want those farmers who find so much benefit from an application of\r\nhen-manure, ashes, and plaster, to their corn and potatoes, to feel that\r\nif they would keep better cows, sheep, and pigs, and feed them better,\r\nthey would get good pay for their feed, and the manure would enable them\r\nto grow larger crops.\r\n\r\nWhile we have been talking, the Deacon was looking over the tables. (See\r\nAppendix.) “I see,” said he, “that wheat and rye contain more nitrogen\r\nthan hen-manure, but less potash and phosphoric acid.”\r\n\r\n“This is true,” said I, “but the way to compare them, in order to see\r\nthe effect of passing the wheat through the hen, is to look at the\r\ncomposition of the air-dried hen-dung. The fresh hen-dung, according to\r\nthe table, contains 56 per cent of water, while wheat contains less than\r\n14½ per cent.”\r\n\r\nLet us compare the composition of 1,000 lbs. air-dried hen-dung with\r\n1,000 lbs. of air-dried wheat and rye, and also with bran, malt-combs,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n                                             _Phosphoric\r\n                     _Nitrogen._  _Potash._     Acid._\r\n  Wheat                 20.8         5.3         7.9\r\n  Wheat Bran            22.4        14.3        27.3\r\n  Rye                   17.6         5.6         8.4\r\n  Rye Bran              23.2        19.3        34.3\r\n  Buckwheat             14.4         2.7         5.7\r\n  Buckwheat Bran        27.2        11.2        12.5\r\n  Malt-roots            36.8        20.6        18.0\r\n  Air-dry Hen-dung.     32.6        17.0        30.8\r\n\r\n“That table,” said the Doctor, “is well worth studying. You see, that\r\nwhen wheat is put through the process of milling, the miller takes out\r\nas much of the starch and gluten as he wants, and leaves you a product\r\n(bran), richer in phosphoric acid, potash, and nitrogen, than you gave\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“And the same is true,” continued the Doctor, “of the hen. You gave her\r\n2,000 grains of wheat, containing 41.6 grains of nitrogen. She puts this\r\nthrough the mill, together with some ashes, and bones, that she picks\r\nup, and she takes out all the starch and fat, and nitrogen, and\r\nphosphate of lime, that she needs to sustain life, and to produce flesh,\r\nbones, feathers, and eggs, and leaves you 1,000 grains of manure\r\ncontaining 32.6 grains of nitrogen, 17.0 grains of potash, and 30.8\r\ngrains of phosphoric acid. I do not say,” continued the Doctor, “that it\r\ntakes exactly 2,000 grains of wheat to make 1,000 grains of dry manure.\r\nI merely give these figures to enable the Deacon to understand why 1,000\r\nlbs. of hen-dung is worth more for manure than 1,000 lbs. of wheat.”\r\n\r\n“I must admit,” said the Deacon, “that I always have been troubled to\r\nunderstand why wheat-bran was worth more for manure than the wheat\r\nitself, I see now--it is because there is less of it. It is for the same\r\nreason that boiled cider is richer than the cider from which it is made.\r\nThe cider has lost water, and the bran has lost starch. What is left is\r\nricher in nitrogen, and potash, and phosphoric acid. And so it is with\r\nmanure. The animals take out of the food the starch and fat, and leave\r\nthe manure richer in nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said I, “Mr. Lawes found by actual experiment, that if you\r\nfeed 500 lbs. of barley-meal to a pig, containing 420 lbs. of _dry\r\nsubstance_, you get only 70 lbs. of dry substance in the manure. Of the\r\n420 lbs. of dry substance, 276.2 lbs. are used to support respiration,\r\netc.; 73.8 lbs. are found in the increase of the pig, and 70 lbs. in the\r\nmanure.”\r\n\r\nThe food contains 52 lbs. of nitrogenous matter; the increase of pig\r\ncontains 7 lbs., and consequently, if there is no loss, the manure\r\nshould contain 45 lbs. of nitrogenous substance = to 7.14 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n“In other words,” said the Doctor, “the 70 lbs. of _dry_ liquid and\r\nsolid pig-manure contains 7.14 lbs. of nitrogen, or 100 lbs. would\r\ncontain 10.2 lbs. of nitrogen, which is more nitrogen than we now get in\r\nthe very best samples of Peruvian guano.”\r\n\r\n“And thus it will be seen,” said I, “that though corn-fed pigs, leaving\r\nout the bedding and water, produce a very small quantity of manure, it\r\nis exceedingly rich.”\r\n\r\nThe table from which these facts were obtained, will be found in the\r\nAppendix--pages 342-3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOW-MANURE, AND HOW TO USE IT.\r\n\r\n“It will do more good if fermented,” said a German farmer in the\r\nneighborhood, who is noted for raising good crops of cabbage, “but I\r\nlike hog-manure better than cow-dung. The right way is to mix the\r\nhog-manure, cow-dung, and horse-manure together.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt about that,” said I, “but when you have a good many cows, and\r\nfew other animals, how would you manage the manure?”\r\n\r\n“I would gather leaves and swamp-muck, and use them for bedding the cows\r\nand pigs. Leaves make splendid bedding, and they make rich manure, and\r\nthe cow-dung and leaves, when made into a pile, will ferment readily,\r\nand make grand manure for--anything. I only wish I had all I could use.”\r\n\r\nThere is no question but what cow-manure is better if fermented, but it\r\nis not always convenient to pile it during the winter in such a way that\r\nit will not freeze. And in this case it may be the better plan to draw\r\nit out on to the land, as opportunity offers.\r\n\r\n“I have heard,” said Charley, “that pig-manure was not good for cabbage,\r\nit produces ‘fingers and toes,’ or club-foot.”\r\n\r\nPossibly such is the case when there is a predisposition to the disease,\r\nbut our German friend says he has never found any ill-effects from its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n“Cows,” said the Doctor, “when giving a large quantity of milk, make\r\nrather poor manure. The manure loses what the milk takes from the food.”\r\n\r\n“We have shown what that loss is,” said I. “It amounts to less than I\r\nthink is generally supposed. And in the winter, when the cows are dry,\r\nthe manure would be as rich as from oxen, provided both were fed alike.\r\nSee Appendix, page 342. It will there be seen that oxen take out only\r\n4.1 lbs. of nitrogen from 100 lbs. of nitrogen consumed in the food. In\r\nother words, provided there is no loss, we should get in the liquid and\r\nsolid excrements of the ox and dry cow 95.9 per cent of the nitrogen\r\nfurnished in the food, and a still higher per cent of the mineral\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP-MANURE.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. Wolff’s table of analyses, sheep-manure, both solid\r\nand liquid, contain less water than the manure from horses, cows, or\r\nswine. With the exception of swine, the solid dung is also the richest\r\nin nitrogen, while the urine of sheep is pre-eminently rich in nitrogen\r\nand potash.\r\n\r\nThese facts are in accordance with the general opinions of farmers.\r\nSheep-manure is considered, next to hen-manure, the most valuable manure\r\nmade on the farm.\r\n\r\nI do not think we have any satisfactory evidence to prove that 3 tons of\r\nclover-hay and a ton of corn fed to a lot of fattening-sheep will afford\r\na quantity of manure containing any more plant-food than the same kind\r\nand amount of food fed to a lot of fattening-cattle. The experiments of\r\nLawes & Gilbert indicate that if there is any difference it is in favor\r\nof the ox. See Appendix, page 343. But it may well be that it is much\r\neasier to save the manure from the sheep than from the cattle. And so,\r\npractically, sheep may be better manure-makers than cattle--for the\r\nsimple reason that less of the urine is lost.\r\n\r\n“As a rule,” said the Doctor, “the dung of sheep contains far less water\r\nthan the dung of cattle, though when you slop your breeding ewes to make\r\nthem give more milk, the dung differs but little in appearance from that\r\nof cows. Ordinarily, however, sheep-dung is light and dry, and, like\r\nhorse-dung, will ferment much more rapidly than cow or pig-dung. In\r\npiling manure in the winter or spring, special pains should be used to\r\nmix the sheep and horse-manure with the cow and pig-manure. And it may\r\nbe remarked that for any crop or for any purpose where stable-manure is\r\ndeemed desirable, sheep-manure would be a better substitute than cow or\r\npig-manure.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURE FROM SWINE.\r\n\r\nThe dry matter of hog-manure, especially the urine, is rich in nitrogen,\r\nbut it is mixed with such a large quantity of water that a ton of\r\nhog-manure, as it is usually found in the pen, is less valuable than a\r\nton of horse or sheep-manure, and only a little more valuable than a ton\r\nof cow-manure.\r\n\r\nAs I have before said, my own plan is to let the store-hogs sleep in a\r\nbasement-cellar, and bed them with horse and sheep-manure. I have this\r\nwinter over 50 sows under the horse-stable, and the manure from 8 horses\r\nkeeps them dry and comfortable, and we are not specially lavish with\r\nstraw in bedding the horses.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer we aim to keep the hogs out in the pastures and\r\norchards as much as possible. This is not only good for the health of\r\nthe pigs, but saves labor and straw in the management of the manure. It\r\ngoes directly to the land. The pigs are good grazers and distribute the\r\nmanure as evenly over the land as sheep--in fact, during hot weather,\r\nsheep are even more inclined to huddle together under the trees, and by\r\nthe side of the fence, than pigs. This is particularly the case with the\r\nlarger breeds of sheep.\r\n\r\nIn the winter it is not a difficult matter to save all the liquid and\r\nsolid excrements from pigs, provided the pens are dry and no water comes\r\nin from the rain and snow. As pigs are often managed, this is the real\r\ndifficulty. Pigs void an enormous quantity of water, especially when fed\r\non slops from the house, whey, etc. If they are kept in a pen with a\r\nseparate feeding and sleeping apartment, both should be under cover, and\r\nthe feeding apartment may be kept covered a foot or so thick with the\r\nsoiled bedding from the sleeping apartment. When the pigs get up in a\r\nmorning, they will go into the feeding apartment, and the liquid will be\r\ndischarged on the mass of manure, straw, etc.\r\n\r\n“Dried muck,” said the Deacon, “comes in very handy about a pig-pen, for\r\nabsorbing the liquid.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “and even dry earth can be used to great advantage, not\r\nmerely to absorb the liquid, but to keep the pens sweet and healthy. The\r\nthree chief points in saving manure from pigs are: 1, To have the pens\r\nunder cover; 2, to keep the feeding apartment or yard covered with a\r\nthick mass of strawy manure and refuse of any kind, and 3, to scatter\r\nplenty of dry earth or dry muck on the floor of the sleeping apartment,\r\nand on top of the manure in the feeding apartment.”\r\n\r\n“You feed most of your pigs,” said the Deacon, “out of doors in the\r\nyard, and they sleep in the pens or basement cellars, and it seems to me\r\nto be a good plan, as they get more fresh air and exercise than if\r\nconfined.”\r\n\r\n“We do not lose much manure,” said I, “by feeding in the yards. You let\r\na dozen pigs sleep in a pen all night, and as soon as they hear you\r\nputting the food in the troughs outside, they come to the door of the\r\npen, and there discharge the liquid and solid excrements on the mass of\r\nmanure left there on purpose to receive and absorb them. I am well aware\r\nthat as pigs are often managed, we lose at least half the value of their\r\nmanure, but there is no necessity for this. A little care and thought\r\nwill save nearly the whole of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBUYING MANURE BY MEASURE OR WEIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe Deacon and I have just been weighing a bushel of different kinds of\r\nmanure made on the farm. We made two weighings of each kind, one thrown\r\nin loose, and the other pressed down firm. The following is the result:\r\n\r\n  Weight of Manure per Bushel, and per Load of 50 Bushels.\r\n\r\n  Wt/Bu   Weight per Bushel in lbs.\r\n  Wt/Load Weight per Load of 50 bushels.\r\n\r\n  ---+--------------------------------------------+-------+---------\r\n  No.|          Kind And Condition Of Manures.    | Wt/Bu | Wt/Load\r\n  ---+--------------------------------------------+-------+---------\r\n     |                                            | lbs.  |  lbs.\r\n   1.|Fresh horse-manure free from straw          |  37½  |  1875\r\n   2.|  ”     ”     ”      ”    ”    ”   pressed  |  55   |  2750\r\n   3.|Fresh horse-manure,                         |       |\r\n     |  as used for bedding pigs                  |  28   |  1400\r\n   4.|  ”     ”     ”                             |       |\r\n     |   ”    ”  ”    ”     ”    pressed          |  46   |  2300\r\n   5.|Horse-manure from pig cellar                |  50   |  2500\r\n   6.|   ”    ”     ”    ”    ”    pressed        |  72   |  3600\r\n   7.|Pig-manure                                  |  57   |  2850\r\n   8.| ”    ”    pressed                          |  75   |  3750\r\n   9.|Pig-manure and dry earth                    |  98   |  4900\r\n  10.|Sheep-manure from open shed                 |  42   |  2100\r\n  11.|  ”     ”     ”    ”    ”   pressed         |  65   |  3250\r\n  12.|Sheep-manure from closed shed               |  28   |  1400\r\n  13.|  ”     ”     ”     ”     ”   pressed       |  38   |  1900\r\n  14.|Fresh cow-dung, free from straw             |  87   |  4350\r\n  15.|Hen-manure                                  |  34   |  1700\r\n  16.| ”    ”    pressed                          |  48   |  2400\r\n  ---+--------------------------------------------+-------+---------\r\n\r\n“In buying manure,” said the Deacon, “it makes quite a difference\r\nwhether the load is trod down solid or thrown loosely into the box.\r\nA load of fresh horse-manure, when trod down, weighs half as much again\r\nas when thrown in loose.”\r\n\r\n“A load of horse-manure,” said Charley, “after it has been used for\r\nbedding pigs, weighs 3,600 lbs., and only 2,300 lbs. when it is thrown\r\ninto the pens, and I suppose a ton of the ‘double-worked’ manure is\r\nfully as valuable as a ton of the fresh horse-manure. If so, 15 ‘loads’\r\nof the pig-pen manure is equal to 24 ‘loads’ of the stable-manure.”\r\n\r\n“A ton of fresh horse-manure,” said the Doctor, “contains about 9 lbs.\r\nof nitrogen; a ton of fresh cow-dung about 6 lbs.; a ton of fresh\r\nsheep-dung, 11 lbs., and a ton of fresh pig-manure, 12 lbs. But if the\r\nDeacon and you weighed correctly, a ‘load’ or cord of cow-manure would\r\ncontain more nitrogen than a load of pressed horse-manure. The figures\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n  A load of 50 bushels of fresh horse-dung,\r\n      pressed and free from straw contains   12.37 lbs. nitrogen.\r\n  A load of fresh cow-dung                   13.05  ”    ”\r\n      ”     ”     sheep ”                    10.45  ”    ”\r\n      ”     ”     pig   ”                    22.50  ”    ”\r\n\r\n“These figures,” said I, “show how necessary it is to look at this\r\nsubject in all its aspects. If I was buying manures _by weight,_ I would\r\nmuch prefer a ton of sheep-manure, if it had been made under cover, to\r\nany other manure except hen-dung, especially if it contained all the\r\nurine from the sheep. But if buying manure by the load or cord, that\r\nfrom a covered pig-pen would be preferable to any other.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUID MANURE ON THE FARM.\r\n\r\nI have never had any personal experience in the use of liquid manure to\r\nany crop except grass. At Rothamsted, Mr. Lawes used to draw out the\r\nliquid manure in a water-cart, and distribute it on grass land.\r\n\r\n“What we want to know,” said the Deacon, “is whether the liquid from our\r\nbarn-yards will pay to draw out. If it will, the proper method of using\r\nit can be left to our ingenuity.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. Wolff, a ton of urine from horses, cows, sheep, and\r\nswine, contains the following amounts of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and\r\npotash, and, for the sake of comparison, I give the composition of\r\ndrainage from the barn-yard, and also of fresh dung of the different\r\nanimals:\r\n\r\n  Table Showing the Amount of Nitrogen, Phosphoric Acid, and Potash,\r\n  in One Ton of the Fresh Dung and Fresh Urine of Different Animals,\r\n  and Also of the Drainage of the Barn-Yard.\r\n\r\n  Nitro(gen).\r\n  Phos(phoric) Acid.\r\n  Pot(ash).\r\n\r\n  ---------------+----------------------+-----------------------\r\n                 | 1 Ton Fresh Dung.    | 1 Ton Fresh Urine.\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                 |Nitro. |Phos.  | Pot. |Nitro. |Phos.  | Pot.\r\n                 |       |acid.  |      |       |acid.  |\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                 | lbs.  |  lbs. | lbs. | lbs.  | lbs.  | lbs.\r\n  Horse          |  8.8  |   7.0 | 7.0  | 31.0  |       |  30.0\r\n  Cow            |  5.8  |   3.4 | 2.0  | 11.6  |       |   9.8\r\n  Sheep          | 11.0  |   6.2 | 3.0  | 39.0  |  0.2  |  45.2\r\n  Swine          | 12.0  |   8.2 | 5.2  |  8.6  |  1.4  |  16.6\r\n  Mean           |  9.4  |   6.2 | 4.3  | 22.5  |  0.4  |  25.4\r\n  Drainage of    |       |       |      |       |       |\r\n      barn-yard  |       |       |      |  3.0  |  0.2  |   9.8\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nThe drainage from a barn-yard, it will be seen, contains a little more\r\nthan half as much nitrogen as cow-dung; and it is probable that the\r\nnitrogen in the liquid is in a much more available condition than that\r\nin the dung. It contains, also, nearly five times as much potash as the\r\ndung. It would seem, therefore, that with proper arrangements for\r\npumping and distributing, this liquid could be drawn a short distance\r\nwith profit.\r\n\r\nBut whether it will or will not pay to cart away the drainage, it is\r\nobviously to our interest to prevent, as far as possible, any of the\r\nliquid from running to waste.\r\n\r\nIt is of still greater importance to guard against any loss of urine. It\r\nwill be seen that, on the average, a ton of the urine of our domestic\r\nanimals contains more than twice as much nitrogen as a ton of the dung.\r\n\r\nWhere straw, leaves, swamp-muck, or other absorbent materials are not\r\nsufficiently abundant to prevent any loss of urine, means should be used\r\nto drain it into a tank so located that the liquid can either be pumped\r\nback on to the manure when needed, or drawn away to the land.\r\n\r\n“I do not see,” said the Deacon, “why horse and sheep-urine should\r\ncontain so much more nitrogen and potash than that from the cow and\r\npig.”\r\n\r\n“The figures given by Prof. Wolff,” said I, “are general averages. The\r\ncomposition of the urine varies greatly. The richer the food in\r\ndigestible nitrogenous matter, the more nitrogen will there be in the\r\ndry matter of the urine. And, other things being equal, the less water\r\nthe animal drinks, the richer will the urine be in nitrogen. The urine\r\nfrom a sheep fed solely on turnips would contain little or no more\r\nnitrogen than the urine of a cow fed on turnips. An ox or a dry cow fed\r\non grass would probably void no more nor no poorer urine than a horse\r\nfed on grass. The urine that Mr. Lawes drew out in a cart on to his\r\ngrass-land was made by sheep that had one lb. each of oil-cake per day,\r\nand one lb. of chaffed clover-hay, and all the turnips they would eat.\r\nThey voided a large quantity of urine, but as the food was rich in\r\nnitrogen, the urine was doubtless nearly or quite as rich as that\r\nanalyzed by Prof. Wolff, though that probably contained less water.”\r\n\r\nIf I was going to draw out liquid manure, I should be very careful to\r\nspout all the buildings, and keep the animals and manure as much under\r\ncover as possible, and also feed food rich in nitrogen. In such\r\ncircumstances, it would doubtless pay to draw the urine full as well as\r\nto draw the solid manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHTSOIL AND SEWAGE.\r\n\r\nThe composition of human excrements, as compared with the mean\r\ncomposition of the excrements from horses, cows, sheep, and swine, so\r\nfar as the nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash are concerned, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Table Showing the Amount of Nitrogen, Phosphoric Acid, and Potash,\r\n  in One Ton of Fresh Human Excrements, and in One Ton of Fresh\r\n  Excrements From Horses, Cows, Sheep, and Swine.\r\n\r\n  Phos(phoric) Acid.\r\n\r\n  -----------+----------------------------+----------------------------\r\n             |          Solids            |          Urine\r\n   One ton   +---------+---------+--------+---------+--------+---------\r\n  (2000 lbs).|         |  Phos.  |        |         |  Phos. |\r\n             |Nitrogen.|  acid.  |Potash. |Nitrogen.|  acid. |Potash.\r\n  -----------+---------+---------+--------+---------+--------+---------\r\n  Human      |20.0 lbs.|21.8 lbs.|5.0 lbs.|12.0 lbs.|3.7 lbs.| 4.0 lbs.\r\n  -----------+---------+---------+--------+---------+--------+---------\r\n  Mean of    |         |         |        |         |        |\r\n  horse, cow,|         |         |        |         |        |\r\n  sheep, and |         |         |        |         |        |\r\n  swine      | 9.4  ”  | 6.2  ”  |4.3  ”  |22.5  ”  |0.4  ”  |25.4  ”\r\n  -----------+---------+---------+--------+---------+--------+---------\r\n\r\nOne ton of fresh fæces contains more than twice as much nitrogen, and\r\nmore than three times as much phosphoric acid, as a ton of fresh mixed\r\nanimal-dung. The nitrogen, too, is probably in a more available\r\ncondition than that in common barnyard-dung; and we should not be far\r\nwrong in estimating 1 ton of fæces equal to 2½ tons of ordinary dung, or\r\nabout equal in value to carefully preserved manure from liberally-fed\r\nsheep, swine, and fattening cattle.\r\n\r\n“It is an unpleasant job,” said the Deacon, “but it pays well to empty\r\nthe vaults at least twice a year.”\r\n\r\n“If farmers,” said the Doctor, “would only throw into the vaults from\r\ntime to time some dry earth or coal ashes, the contents of the vaults\r\ncould be removed without any disagreeable smell.”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” said I, “and even where a vault has been shamefully\r\nneglected, and is full of offensive matter, it can be cleaned out\r\nwithout difficulty and without smell. I have cleaned out a large vault\r\nin an hour. We were drawing manure from the yards with three teams and\r\npiling it in the field. We brought back a load of sand and threw half of\r\nit into the vault, and put the other half on one side, to be used as\r\nrequired. The sand and fæces were then, with a long-handled shovel,\r\nthrown into the wagon, and drawn to the pile of manure in the field, and\r\nthrown on to the pile, not more than two or three inches thick. The team\r\nbrought back a load of sand, and so we continued until the work was\r\ndone. Sand or dry earth is cheap, and we used all that was necessary to\r\nprevent the escape of any unpleasant gases, and to keep the material\r\nfrom adhering to the shovels or the wagon.”\r\n\r\n“Human urine,” said the Doctor, “is richer in phosphoric acid, but much\r\npoorer in nitrogen and potash than the urine from horses, cows, sheep,\r\nand swine.”\r\n\r\n“Some years ago,” said the Deacon, “Mr. H. E. Hooker, of Rochester, used\r\nto draw considerable quantities of urine from the city to his farm. It\r\nwould pay better to draw out the urine from farm animals.”\r\n\r\n“The figures given above,” said I, “showing the composition of human\r\nexcrements, are from Prof. Wolff, and probably are generally correct.\r\nBut, of course, the composition of the excrements would vary greatly,\r\naccording to the food.”\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained by Lawes and Gilbert that the amount of matter\r\nvoided by an adult male in the course of a year is--fæces, 95 lbs.;\r\nurine, 1,049 lbs.; total liquid and solid excrements in the pure state,\r\n1,144 lbs. These contain:\r\n\r\n  Dry substance--fæces, 23¾ lbs.; urine, 34½; total, 58¼ lbs.\r\n  Mineral matter--fæces, 2½ lbs.; urine, 12; total, 14½ lbs.\r\n  Carbon--fæces, 10 lbs.; urine, 12; total 22 lbs.\r\n  Nitrogen--fæces, 1.2 lbs.; urine, 10.8; total, 12 lbs.\r\n  Phosphoric acid--fæces, 0.7 lbs.; urine, 1.93; total, 2.63 lbs.\r\n  Potash--fæces, 0.24 lbs.; urine, 2.01; total, 2.25 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe amount of potash is given by Prof. E. Wolff, not by Lawes and\r\nGilbert.\r\n\r\nThe mixed solid and liquid excrements, in the condition they leave the\r\nbody, contain about 95 per cent of water. It would require, therefore,\r\n20 tons of fresh mixed excrements, to make one ton of _dry_ nightsoil,\r\nor the entire amount voided by a mixed family of 43 persons in a year.\r\n\r\nOne hundred lbs. of fresh fæces contain 75 lbs. of water, and 25 lbs. of\r\ndry substance.\r\n\r\nOne hundred lbs. of fresh urine contain 96½ lbs. of water, and 3½ lbs.\r\nof dry substance.\r\n\r\nOne hundred lbs. of the dry substance of the fæces contain 5 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen, and 5½ lbs. of phosphates.\r\n\r\nOne hundred lbs. of the dry substance of the urine contain 27 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen, and 10¾ lbs. of phosphates.\r\n\r\nThese figures are from Lawes and Gilbert, and may be taken as\r\nrepresenting the composition of excrements from moderately well-fed\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wolff, a ton of fresh human urine contains 12 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen. According to Lawes and Gilbert, 18 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe liquid carted from the city by Mr. Hooker was from well-fed adult\r\nmales, and would doubtless be fully equal to the figures given by Lawes\r\nand Gilbert. If we call the nitrogen worth 20 cents a lb., and the\r\nphosphoric acid (soluble) worth 12½ cents, a ton of such urine would be\r\nworth, _on the land_, $1.06.\r\n\r\n“A ton of the fresh fæces,” said the Deacon, “at the same estimate,\r\nwould be worth (20 lbs. nitrogen, at 20 cents, $4; 21¾ lbs. phosphoric\r\nacid, at 12½ cents, $2.70), $6.70.”\r\n\r\n“Not by a good deal,” said the Doctor. “The nitrogen and phosphoric acid\r\nin the urine are both soluble, and would be immediately available. But\r\nthe nitrogen and phosphoric acid in the fæces would be mostly insoluble.\r\nWe cannot estimate the nitrogen in the fæces at over 15 cents a lb., and\r\nthe phosphoric acid at 5 cents. This would make the value of a ton of\r\nfresh fæces, _on the land_, $4.09.”\r\n\r\n“This makes the ton of fæces worth about the same as a ton of urine. But\r\nI would like to know,” said the Deacon, “if you really believe we could\r\nafford to pay $4 per ton for the stuff delivered on the farm?”\r\n\r\n“If we could get the genuine article,” said the Doctor, “it would be\r\nworth $4 a ton. But, as a rule, it is mixed with water, and dirt, and\r\nstones, and bricks, and rubbish of all kinds. Still, it is\r\nunquestionably a valuable fertilizer.”\r\n\r\n“In the dry-earth closets,” said I, “such a large quantity of earth has\r\nto be used to absorb the liquid, that the material, even if used several\r\ntimes, is not worth carting any considerable distance. Dr. Gilbert found\r\nthat 5 tons of absolutely dry earth, before using, contained 16.7 lbs.\r\nof nitrogen.\r\n\r\n  After being used _once_,  5 tons of the dry earth contained 24.0 lbs.\r\n    ”     ”    ”   twice,       ”    ”     ”    ”       ”     36.3  ”\r\n    ”     ”    ”   three times, ”    ”     ”    ”       ”     44.6  ”\r\n    ”     ”    ”   four times,  ”    ”     ”    ”       ”     54.0  ”\r\n    ”     ”    ”   five times,  ”    ”     ”    ”       ”     61.4  ”\r\n    ”     ”    ”   six times,   ”    ”     ”    ”       ”     71.6  ”\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker found that five tons of dry earth gained about 7 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen, and 11 lbs. of phosphoric acid, each time it was used in the\r\nclosets. If we consider each lb. of nitrogen with the phosphoric acid\r\nworth 20 cents a lb., 5 tons of the dry earth, after being used once,\r\nwould be worth $1.46, or less than 30 cents a ton, and after it had been\r\nused six times, five tons of the material would be worth $11.98, or\r\nabout $2.40 per ton.\r\n\r\nIn this calculation I have not reckoned in the value of the nitrogen the\r\nsoil contained before using. Soil, on a farm, is cheap.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from these facts that any earth-closet manure a farmer would\r\nbe likely to purchase in the city has not a very high value. It is\r\nabsurd to talk of making “guano” or any concentrated fertilizer out of\r\nthe material from earth-closets.\r\n\r\n“It is rather a reflection on our science and practical skill,” said the\r\nDoctor, “but it looks at present as though the only plan to adopt in\r\nlarge cities is to use enormous quantities of water and wash the stuff\r\ninto the rivers and oceans for the use of aquatic plants and fishes. The\r\nnitrogen is not all lost. Some of it comes back to us in rains and dews.\r\nOf course, there are places where the sewage of our cities and villages\r\ncan be used for irrigating purposes. But when water is used as freely as\r\nit ought to be used for health, the sewage is so extremely poor in\r\nfertilizing matter, that it must be used in enormous quantities, to\r\nfurnish a dressing equal to an application of 20 tons of stable-manure\r\nper acre.”\r\n\r\n“If,” continued the Doctor, “the sewage is used merely as _water_ for\r\nirrigating purposes, that is another question. The water itself may\r\noften be of great benefit. This aspect of the question has not received\r\nthe attention it merits.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPERUVIAN GUANO.\r\n\r\nGuano is the manure of birds that live principally on fish.\r\n\r\nFish contain a high percentage of nitrogen and phosphoric acid, and\r\nconsequently when fish are digested and the carbon is burnt out of them,\r\nthe manure that is left contains a still higher percentage of nitrogen\r\nand phosphoric acid than the fish from which it was derived.\r\n\r\nGuano is digested fish. If the guano, or the manure from the birds\r\nliving on fish, has been preserved without loss, it would contain not\r\nonly a far higher percentage of nitrogen, but the nitrogen would be in a\r\nmuch more available condition, and consequently be more valuable than\r\nthe fish from which the guano is made.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the value of guano is largely due to a difference in\r\nthe climate and locality in which it is deposited by the birds. In a\r\nrainless and hot climate, where the bird-droppings would dry rapidly,\r\nlittle or no putrefaction or fermentation would take place, and there\r\nwould be no loss of nitrogen from the formation and escape of ammonia.\r\n\r\nIn a damper climate, or where there was more or less rain, the\r\nbird-droppings would putrefy, and the ammonia would be liable to\r\nevaporate, or to be leached out by the rain.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago I saw a quantity of Peruvian guano that contained more\r\nthan 18 per cent of nitrogen. It was remarkably light colored. You know\r\nthat the white part of hen-droppings consists principally of uric acid,\r\nwhich contains about 33 per cent of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nFor many years it was not difficult to find guano containing 13 per cent\r\nof nitrogen, and genuine Peruvian guano was the cheapest and best source\r\nof available nitrogen. But latterly, not only has the price been\r\nadvanced, but the quality of the guano has deteriorated. It has\r\ncontained less nitrogen and more phosphoric acid. See the Chapter on\r\n“Value of Fertilizers,” Page 324.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALTS OF AMMONIA AND NITRATE OF SODA.\r\n\r\n“I wish,” said the Deacon, “you would tell us something about the\r\n‘ammonia-salts’ and nitrate of soda so long used in Lawes and Gilbert’s\r\nexperiments. I have never seen any of them.”\r\n\r\n“You could not invest a little money to better advantage than to send\r\nfor a few bags of sulphate of ammonia and nitrate of soda. You would\r\nthen see what they are, and would learn more by using them, than I can\r\ntell you in a month. You use them just as you would common salt. As a\r\nrule, the better plan is to sow them broadcast, and it is important to\r\ndistribute them evenly. In sowing common salt, if you drop a handful in\r\na place, it will kill the plants. And so it is with nitrate of soda or\r\nsulphate of ammonia. Two or three pounds on a square rod will do good,\r\nbut if you put half of it on a square yard, it will burn up the crop,\r\nand the other half will be applied in such a small quantity that you\r\nwill see but little effect, and will conclude that it is a humbug.\r\nJudging from over thirty years’ experience, I am safe in saying that not\r\none man in ten can be trusted to sow these manures. They should be sown\r\nwith as much care as you sow grass or clover-seed.”\r\n\r\n“The best plan,” said the Doctor, “is to mix them with sifted\r\ncoal-ashes, or with gypsum, or sifted earth.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” said I, “though there is nothing gained by mixing earth or\r\nashes with them, except in securing a more even distribution. And if I\r\nwas going to sow them myself, I would much prefer sowing them unmixed.\r\nAny man who can sow wheat or barley can sow sulphate of ammonia or\r\nnitrate of soda.”\r\n\r\n“Lawes and Gilbert,” said the Deacon, “used sulphate and muriate of\r\nammonia, and in one or two instances the carbonate of ammonia. Which is\r\nthe best?”\r\n\r\n“The one that will furnish ammonia or nitrogen at the cheapest rate,”\r\nsaid the Doctor, “is the best to use. The muriate of ammonia contains\r\nthe most ammonia, but the sulphate, in proportion to the ammonia, is\r\ncheaper than the muriate, and far cheaper than the carbonate.”\r\n\r\nCarbonate of ammonia contains 21½ per cent of ammonia.\r\n\r\nSulphate of ammonia contains 25¾ per cent of ammonia = 21⅕ of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nMuriate of ammonia contains 31 per cent of ammonia = 25½ of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nNitrate of soda contains 16⅖ per cent of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nNitrate of potash, 13¾ per cent of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures you can ascertain, when you know the price of each,\r\nwhich is the cheapest source of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n“True,” said I, “but it must be understood that these figures represent\r\nthe composition of a pure article. The commercial sulphate of ammonia,\r\nand nitrate of soda, would usually contain 10 per cent of impurities.\r\nLawes and Gilbert, who have certainly had much experience, and doubtless\r\nget the best commercial articles, state that a mixture of equal parts\r\nsulphate and muriate of ammonia contains about 25 per cent of ammonia.\r\nAccording to the figures given by the Doctor, the mixture would contain,\r\nif pure, over 28 per cent of ammonia. In other words, 90 lbs. of the\r\npure article contains as much as 100 lbs. of the commercial article.”\r\n\r\nAs to whether it is better, when you can buy nitrogen at the same price\r\nin nitrate of soda as you can in sulphate of ammonia, to use the one or\r\nthe other will depend on circumstances. The nitrogen exists as nitric\r\nacid in the nitrate of soda, and as ammonia in the sulphate of ammonia.\r\nBut there are good reasons to believe that before ammonia is used by the\r\nplants it is converted into nitric acid. If, therefore, we could apply\r\nthe nitrate just where it is wanted by the growing crop, and when there\r\nis rain enough to thoroughly distribute it through the soil to the depth\r\nof six or eight inches, there can be little doubt that the nitrate, in\r\nproportion to the nitrogen, would have a quicker and better effect than\r\nthe sulphate of ammonia.\r\n\r\n“There is another point to be considered,” said the Doctor. “Nitric acid\r\nis much more easily washed out of the soil than ammonia. More or less of\r\nthe ammonia enters into chemical combination with portions of the soil,\r\nand may be retained for months or years.”\r\n\r\nWhen we use nitrate of soda, we run the risk of losing more or less of\r\nit from leaching, while if we use ammonia, we lose, for the time being,\r\nmore or less of it from its becoming locked up in insoluble combinations\r\nin the soil. For spring crops, such as barley or oats, or spring wheat,\r\nor for a meadow or lawn, or for top-dressing winter-wheat in the spring,\r\nthe nitrate of soda, provided it is sown early enough, or at any time in\r\nthe spring, just previous to a heavy rain, is likely to produce a better\r\neffect than the sulphate of ammonia. But for sowing in the autumn on\r\nwinter-wheat the ammonia is to be preferred.\r\n\r\n“Saltpetre, or nitrate of potash,” said the Deacon, “does not contain as\r\nmuch nitrogen as nitrate of soda.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said the Doctor, “if it could be purchased at the same price,\r\nit would be the cheaper manure. It contains 46½ per cent of potash, and\r\non soils, or for crops where potash is needed, we may sometimes be able\r\nto purchase saltpetre to advantage.”\r\n\r\n“If I could come across a lot of damaged saltpetre,” said I, “that could\r\nbe got for what it is worth as manure, I should like to try it on my\r\napple trees--one row with nitrate of soda, and one row with nitrate of\r\npotash. When we apply manure to apple trees, the ammonia, phosphoric\r\nacid, and potash, are largely retained in the first few inches of\r\nsurface soil, and the deeper roots get hold of only those portions which\r\nleach through the upper layer of earth. Nitric acid, however, is easily\r\nwashed down into the subsoil, and would soon reach all the roots of the\r\ntrees.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nBONE-DUST AND SUPERPHOSPHATE OF LIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nBone-dust is often spoken of as a phosphatic manure, and it has been\r\nsupposed that the astonishing effect bone-dust sometimes produces on old\r\npasture-land, is due to its furnishing phosphoric acid to the soil.\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered that bone-dust furnishes nitrogen as well as\r\nphosphoric acid, and we are not warranted in ascribing the good effect\r\nof bones to phosphoric acid alone.\r\n\r\nBones differ considerably in composition. They consist essentially of\r\ngelatine and phosphate of lime. Bones from young animals, and the soft\r\nporous parts of all bones, contain more gelatine than the solid parts,\r\nor the bones from older animals. On the average, 1,000 lbs. of good\r\ncommercial bone-dust contains 38 lbs. of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nOn the old dairy farms of Cheshire, where bone-dust produced such marked\r\nimprovement in the quantity and quality of the pastures and meadows, it\r\nwas usual to apply from 4,000 to 5,000 lbs. per acre, and often more. In\r\nother words, a dressing of bone-dust frequently contained 200 lbs. of\r\nnitrogen per acre--equal to 20 or 25 tons of barn-yard manure.\r\n\r\n“It has been supposed,” said the Doctor, “that owing to the removal of\r\nso much phosphoric acid in the cheese sold from the farm, that the dairy\r\npastures of Cheshire had been exhausted of phosphoric acid, and that the\r\nwonderful benefits following an application of bone-dust to these\r\npastures, was due to its supplying phosphoric acid.”\r\n\r\n“I do not doubt,” said I, “the value of phosphoric acid when applied in\r\nconnection with nitrogen to old pasture lands, but I contend that the\r\nexperience of the Cheshire dairymen with bone-dust is no positive proof\r\nthat their soils were particularly deficient in phosphoric acid. There\r\nare many instances given where the gelatine of the bones, alone, proved\r\nof great value to the grass. And I think it will be found that the\r\nCheshire dairymen do not find as much benefit from superphosphate as\r\nthey did from bone-dust. And the reason is, that the latter, in addition\r\nto the phosphoric acid, furnished a liberal dressing of nitrogen.\r\nFurthermore, it is not true that dairying specially robs the soil of\r\nphosphoric acid. Take one of these old dairy farms in Cheshire, where a\r\ndressing of bone-dust, according to a writer in the Journal of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society, has caused ‘a miserable covering of pink grass,\r\nrushes, and a variety of other noxious weeds, to give place to the most\r\nluxuriant herbage of wild clover, trefoil, and other succulent and\r\nnutritious grasses.’ It is evident from this description of the pastures\r\nbefore the bones were used, that it would take at least three acres to\r\nkeep a cow for a year.”\r\n\r\n“I have known,” says the same writer quoted above, “many a poor, honest,\r\nbut half broken-hearted man raised from poverty to comparative\r\nindependence, and many a sinking family saved from inevitable ruin by\r\nthe help of this wonderful manure.” And this writer not only spoke from\r\nobservation and experience, but he showed his faith by his works, for he\r\ntells us that he had paid nearly $50,000 for this manure.\r\n\r\nNow, on one of these poor dairy farms, where it required 3 acres to keep\r\na cow, and where the grass was of poor quality, it is not probable that\r\nthe cows produced over 250 lbs. of cheese in a year. One thousand pounds\r\nof cheese contains, on the average, about 45½ lbs. of nitrogen; 2½ lbs.\r\nof potash, and 11½ lbs. of phosphoric acid. From this it follows, if 250\r\nlbs. of cheese are sold annually from three acres of pasture, less than\r\none lb. of phosphoric acid per acre is exported from the farm in the\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nOne ton of timothy-hay contains nearly 14½ lbs. of phosphoric acid. And\r\nso a farmer who raises a ton of timothy-hay per acre, and sells it,\r\nsends off as much phosphoric acid in one year as such a Cheshire\r\ndairyman as I have alluded to did in fourteen years.\r\n\r\nWhat the dairymen want, and what farmers generally want, is nitrogen\r\n_and_ phosphoric acid. Bone-dust furnishes both, and this was the reason\r\nof its wonderful effects.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow from this, that bone-dust is the cheapest and best\r\nmanure we can use. It is an old and popular manure, and usually commands\r\na good price. It sells for all it is worth. A dozen years ago, I bought\r\nten tons of bone-dust at $18 per ton. I have offered $25 per ton since\r\nfor a similar lot, but the manufacturers find a market in New York for\r\nall they can make.\r\n\r\n\r\nBone-dust, besides nitrogen, contains about 23 per cent of phosphoric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n“That does not give me,” said the Deacon, “any idea of its value.”\r\n\r\n“Let us put it in another shape, then,” said I. “One ton of good\r\nbone-dust contains about as much nitrogen as 8½ tons of fresh\r\nstable-manure, and as much phosphoric acid as 110 tons of fresh\r\nstable-manure. But one ton of manure contains more potash than 5 tons of\r\nbone-dust.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBone-dust, like barnyard-manure, does not immediately yield up its\r\nnitrogen and phosphoric acid to plants. The bone phosphate of lime is\r\ninsoluble in water, and but very slightly soluble in water containing\r\ncarbonic acid. The gelatine of the bones would soon decompose in a\r\nmoist, porous, warm soil, provided it was not protected by the oil and\r\nby the hard matter of the bones. Steaming, by removing the oil, removes\r\none of the hindrances to decomposition. Reducing the bones as fine as\r\npossible is another means of increasing their availability.\r\n\r\nAnother good method of increasing the availability of bone-dust is to\r\nmix it with barnyard-manure, and let both ferment together in a heap.\r\nI am inclined to think this the best, simplest, and most economical\r\nmethod of rendering bone-dust available. The bone-dust causes the heap\r\nof manure to ferment more readily, and the fermentation of the manure\r\nsoftens the bones. Both the manure and the bones are improved and\r\nrendered richer and more available by the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother method of increasing the availability of bone-dust is by mixing\r\nit with sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe phosphate of lime in bones is insoluble in water, though rain water\r\ncontaining carbonic acid, and the water in soils, slowly dissolve it. By\r\ntreating the bones with sulphuric acid, the phosphate of lime is\r\ndecomposed and rendered soluble. Consequently, bone-dust treated with\r\nsulphuric acid will act much more rapidly than ordinary bone-dust. The\r\nsulphuric acid does not make it any _richer_ in phosphoric acid or\r\nnitrogen. It simply renders them more available.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said the Doctor, “the use of sulphuric acid for ‘dissolving’\r\nbones, or rather phosphate of lime, introduced a new era in agriculture.\r\nIt is the grand agricultural fact of the nineteenth century.”\r\n\r\n“It is perhaps not necessary,” said I, “to give any direction for\r\ntreating bones with sulphuric acid. We have got beyond that. We can now\r\nbuy superphosphate cheaper than we can make it from bones.”\r\n\r\n“But is it as good?” asked the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“Soluble phosphate of lime,” said I, “is soluble phosphate of lime, and\r\nit makes no difference whether it is made from burnt bones, or from\r\nphosphatic guano, or mineral phosphate. That question has been fully\r\ndecided by the most satisfactory experiments.”\r\n\r\n“Before you and the Deacon discuss that subject,” said the Doctor, “it\r\nwould be well to tell Charley what superphosphate is.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would tell me,” said Charley.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Doctor, “phosphate of lime, as it exists in bones, is\r\ncomposed of three atoms of lime and one atom of phosphoric acid.\r\nChemists call it the tricalcic phosphate. It is also called the basic\r\nphosphate of lime, and not unfrequently the ‘bone-earth phosphate.’ It\r\nis the ordinary or common form of phosphate of lime, as it exists in\r\nanimals, and plants, and in the various forms of mineral phosphates.\r\n\r\n“Then there is another phosphate of lime, called the dicalcic phosphate,\r\nor neutral phosphate of lime, or reverted phosphate of lime. It is\r\ncomposed of one atom of water, two atoms of lime, and one atom of\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n“Then we have what we call superphosphate, or acid phosphate of lime, or\r\nmore properly monocalcic phosphate. It is composed of two atoms of\r\nwater, one atom of lime, and one atom of phosphoric acid. This acid\r\nphosphate of lime _is soluble in water_.\r\n\r\n“The manufacture of superphosphate of lime is based on these facts. The\r\n_one-lime_ phosphate is soluble, the _three-lime_ phosphate is\r\ninsoluble. To convert the latter into the former, all we have to do is\r\nto _take away two atoms of lime_.\r\n\r\n“Sulphuric acid has a stronger affinity for lime than phosphoric acid.\r\nAnd when you mix enough sulphuric acid with finely ground three-lime\r\nphosphate, to take away two atoms of lime, you get the phosphoric acid\r\nunited with one atom of lime and two atoms of water.”\r\n\r\n“And what,” asked the Deacon, “becomes of the two atoms of lime?”\r\n\r\n“They unite with the sulphuric acid,” said the Doctor, “and form\r\nplaster, gypsum, or sulphate of lime.”\r\n\r\n“The molecular weight of water,” continued the Doctor, “is 18; of lime,\r\n56; of sulphuric acid, 80; of phosphoric acid, 142.\r\n\r\n“An average sample of commercial bone dust,” continued the Doctor,\r\n“contains about 50 per cent of phosphate of lime. If we take 620 lbs. of\r\nfinely-ground bone-dust, containing 310 lbs. of three-lime phosphate,\r\nand mix with it 160 lbs. of sulphuric acid (say 240 lbs. common oil of\r\nvitriol, sp. gr. 1.7), the sulphuric acid will unite with 112 lbs. of\r\nlime, and leave the 142 lbs. of phosphoric acid united with the\r\nremaining 56 lbs. of lime.”\r\n\r\n“And that will give you,” said the Deacon, “780 lbs. of ‘dissolved\r\nbones,’ or superphosphate of lime.”\r\n\r\n“It will give you more than that,” said the Doctor, “because, as I said\r\nbefore, the two atoms of lime (112 lbs.) are replaced by two atoms (36\r\nlbs.) of water. And, furthermore, the two atoms of sulphate of lime\r\nproduced, contained two atoms (36 lbs.) of water. The mixture,\r\ntherefore, contains, even when perfectly dry, 72 lbs. of water.”\r\n\r\n“Where does this water come from?” asked the Deacon.\r\n\r\n“When I was at Rothamsted,” said I, “the superphosphate which Mr. Lawes\r\nused in his experiments was made on the farm from animal charcoal, or\r\nburnt bones, ground as fine as possible--the finer the better. We took\r\n40 lbs. of the meal, and mixed it with 20 lbs. of water, and then poured\r\non 30 lbs. of common sulphuric acid (sp.g. 1.7), and stirred it up\r\nrapidly and thoroughly, and then threw it out of the vessel into a heap,\r\non the earth-floor in the barn. Then mixed another portion, and so on,\r\nuntil we had the desired quantity, say two or three tons. The last year\r\nI was at Rothamsted, we mixed 40 lbs. bone-meal, 30 lbs. water, and 30\r\nlbs. acid; and we thought the additional water enabled us to mix the\r\nacid and meal together easier and better.”\r\n\r\n“Dr. Habirshaw tells me,” said the Doctor, “that in making the\r\n‘Rectified Peruvian Guano’ no water is necessary, and none is used. The\r\nwater in the guano and in the acid is sufficient to furnish the two\r\natoms of water for the phosphate, and the two atoms for the sulphate of\r\nlime.”\r\n\r\n“Such is undoubtedly the case,” said I, “and when large quantities of\r\nsuperphosphate are made, and the mixing is done by machinery, it is not\r\nnecessary to use water. The advantage of using water is in the greater\r\nease of mixing.”\r\n\r\n“Bone-dust,” said the Doctor, “contains about 6 per cent of water, and\r\nthe sulphuric acid (sp.g. 1.7) contains about one-third its weight of\r\nwater. So that, if you take 620 lbs. of bone-dust, and mix with it 240\r\nlbs. of common sulphuric acid, you have in the mixture 117 lbs. of\r\nwater, which is 45 lbs. more than is needed to furnish the water of\r\ncombination.”\r\n\r\n“The superphosphate produced from 620 lbs. of bones, therefore,”\r\ncontinued the Doctor, “would contain:\r\n\r\n  Phosphoric acid}                           {142 lbs.\r\n  Lime           } acid phosphate            { 56  ”\r\n  Water          }                           { 36  ”\r\n\r\n  Sulphuric acid }                           {160 lbs.\r\n  Lime           } sulphate of lime          {112  ”\r\n  Water          }                           { 36  ”\r\n\r\n  Organic matter, ash, etc., of the bones*    335  ”\r\n                                              --------\r\n    Total _dry_ superphosphate                877  ”\r\n  Moisture, or loss                            45  ”\r\n                                              --------\r\n    Total mixture                             922 lbs.\r\n\r\n  * Containing nitrogen, 23½ lbs.\r\n\r\n“There is a small quantity of carbonate of lime in the bones,” said I,\r\n“which would take up a little of the acid, and you will have a\r\nremarkably good article if you calculate that the 620 lbs. of bone-dust\r\nfurnish you half a ton (1,000 lbs.) of superphosphate. It will be a\r\nbetter article than it is practically possible to make.”\r\n\r\n“Assuming that it made half a ton,” said the Doctor, “it would contain\r\n14¼ per cent of soluble phosphoric acid, and 2⅓ per cent of nitrogen.”\r\n\r\n“With nitrogen at 20 cents per lb., and soluble phosphoric acid at 12½\r\nc. per lb., this half ton of superphosphate, made from 620 lbs. of good\r\nbone-dust, would be worth $22.50, or $45 per ton.”\r\n\r\n“Or, to look at it in another light,” continued the Doctor, “a ton of\r\nbone-dust, made into such a superphosphate as we are talking about,\r\nwould be worth $72.58.”\r\n\r\n“How much,” asked the Deacon, “would a ton of the bone-dust be\r\nconsidered worth before it was converted into superphosphate?”\r\n\r\n“A ton of bone-dust,” replied the Doctor, “contains 76 lbs. of nitrogen,\r\nworth, at 18 cents per lb., $13.68, and 464 lbs. phosphoric acid, worth\r\n7 cents per lb., $32.48. In other words, a ton of bone-dust, at the\r\nusual estimate, is worth $46.16.”\r\n\r\n“And,” said the Deacon, “after it is converted into superphosphate, the\r\nsame ton of bones is worth $72.58. It thus appears that you pay $26.42\r\nper ton for simply making the phosphoric acid in a ton of bones soluble.\r\nIsn’t it paying a little too much for the whistle?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly such is the case,” said I, “and in point of fact, I think\r\nbone-dust, especially from steamed or boiled bones, can be used with\r\nmore economy in its natural state than in the form of superphosphate.”\r\n\r\nSuperphosphate can be made more economically from mineral phosphates\r\nthan from bones--the nitrogen, if desired, being supplied from\r\nfish-scrap or from some other cheap source of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nBut for my own use I would prefer to buy a good article of\r\nsuperphosphate of lime, containing no nitrogen, provided it can be\r\nobtained cheap enough. I would buy the ammoniacal, or nitrogenous manure\r\nseparately, and do my own mixing--unless the mixture could be bought at\r\na less cost than the same weight of soluble phosphoric acid, and\r\navailable nitrogen could be obtained separately.\r\n\r\nA pure superphosphate--and by pure I mean a superphosphate containing no\r\nnitrogen--can be drilled in with the seed without injury, but I should\r\nbe a little afraid of drilling in some of the ammoniacal or nitrogenous\r\nsuperphosphates with small seeds.\r\n\r\nAnd then, again, the “nitrogen” in a superphosphate mixture may be in\r\nthe form of nitric acid, or sulphate of ammonia, in one case, or, in\r\nanother case, in the form of hair, woollen rags, hide, or leather. It is\r\nfar more valuable as nitric acid or ammonia, because it will act\r\nquicker, and if I wanted hair, woollen rags, horn-shavings, etc.,\r\nI would prefer to have them separate from the superphosphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty five to thirty years ago, much was said in regard to special\r\nmanures. Fertilizers were prepared for the different crops with special\r\nreference to the composition of the plants.\r\n\r\n“But it was known then, as now,” said the Doctor, “that all our\r\nagricultural plants were composed of the same elements.”\r\n\r\n“True, but what was claimed was this: Some crops contain, for instance,\r\nmore phosphoric acid than other crops, and for these a manure rich in\r\nphosphoric acid was provided. Others contained a large proportion of\r\npotash, and these were called ‘potash crops,’ and the manure prescribed\r\nfor them was rich in potash. And so with the other ingredients of\r\nplants.”\r\n\r\n“I recollect it well,” said the Doctor, “and, in truth, for several\r\nyears I had much faith in the idea. It was advocated with consummate\r\nability by the lamented Liebig, and in fact a patent was taken out by\r\nthe Musgraves, of Liverpool, for the manufacture of Liebig’s Special\r\nManures, based on this theory. But the manures, though extensively used\r\nby the leading farmers of England, and endorsed by the highest\r\nauthorities, did not in the end stand the test of actual farm practice,\r\nand their manufacture was abandoned. And I do not know of any\r\nexperienced agricultural chemist who now advocates this doctrine of\r\nspecial manures.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Vœlcker says: ‘The ash-analyses of plants do not afford a\r\nsufficiently trustworthy guide to the practical farmer in selecting the\r\nkind of manure which is best applied to each crop.’”\r\n\r\n“Never mind the authorities,” said the Deacon; “what we want are facts.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the Doctor, “take the wheat and turnip crop as an\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n“We will suppose that there is twice the weight of wheat-straw as of\r\ngrain; and that to 10 tons of bulbs there is 3 tons of turnip-tops. Now,\r\n100 lbs. each of the ash of these two crops contain:\r\n\r\n                   _Wheat crop._  _Turnip crop._\r\n  Phosphoric acid    11.44          7.33\r\n  Potash             15.44         32.75\r\n  Sulphuric acid      2.44         11.25\r\n  Lime                5.09         19.28\r\n  Magnesia            3.33          1.56\r\n\r\n“There are other ingredients,” continued the Doctor, “but these are the\r\nmost important.\r\n\r\n“Now, if you were going to compound a manure for wheat, say 100 lbs.,\r\nconsisting of potash and phosphoric acid, what would be the\r\nproportions?”\r\n\r\nThe Deacon figured for a few moments, and then produced the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n  100 Lbs. Special Manure for Wheat and Turnips.\r\n\r\n                   _Wheat manure._  _Turnip manure._\r\n  Phosphoric acid    42½ lbs.         18⅓ lbs.\r\n  Potash             57½  ”           81⅔  ”\r\n                    ------------     ------------\r\n                    100  lbs.        100  lbs.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said the Doctor, “and yet the experiments of Lawes and\r\nGilbert clearly prove that a soil needs to be richer in available\r\nphosphoric acid, to produce even a fair crop of turnips, than to produce\r\na large crop of wheat. And the experience of farmers everywhere tends in\r\nthe same direction. England is the greatest turnip-growing country in\r\nthe world, and you will find that where one farmer applies potash to\r\nturnips, or superphosphate to wheat, a hundred farmers use\r\nsuperphosphate as a special manure for the turnip crop.”\r\n\r\n“And we are certainly warranted in saying,” continued the Doctor, “_that\r\nthe composition of a plant affords_, in practical agriculture, and on\r\nordinary cultivated soils, _no sort of indication as to the composition\r\nof the manure it is best to apply to the crop_.”\r\n\r\n“Again,” continued the Doctor, “if the theory was a correct one, it\r\nwould follow that those crops which contained the most nitrogen, would\r\nrequire the most nitrogen in the manure. Beans, peas, and clover would\r\nrequire a soil or a manure richer in available nitrogen than wheat,\r\nbarley, or oats. We know that the _very reverse_ is true--know it from\r\nactual, and repeated, and long-continued experiments like those of Lawes\r\nand Gilbert, and from the common experience of farmers everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“You need not get excited,” said the Deacon, “the theory is a very\r\nplausible one, and while I cannot dispute your facts, I must confess I\r\ncannot see _why_ it is not reasonable to suppose that a plant which\r\ncontains a large amount of nitrogen should not want a manure specially\r\nrich in nitrogen; or why turnips which contain so much potash should not\r\nwant a soil or manure specially rich in potash.”\r\n\r\n“Do you recollect,” said I, “that crop of turnips I raised on a poor\r\nblowing-sand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Deacon, “it was the best crop of turnips I ever saw\r\ngrow.”\r\n\r\n“That crop of turnips,” said I, “was due to a dressing of superphosphate\r\nof lime, with little or no potash in it.”\r\n\r\n“I know all that,” said the Deacon. “I admit the fact that\r\nsuperphosphate is a good manure for turnips. What I want to know is the\r\nreason why superphosphate is better for turnips than for wheat?”\r\n\r\n“Many reasons might be given,” said the Doctor; “Prof. Vœlcker\r\nattributes it to the limited feeding range of the roots of turnips, as\r\ncompared to wheat. ‘The roots of wheat,’ says Prof. Vœlcker, ‘as is well\r\nknown, penetrate the soil to a much greater depth than the more delicate\r\nfeeding fibres of the roots of turnips. Wheat, remaining on the ground\r\ntwo or three months longer than turnips, can avail itself for a longer\r\nperiod of the resources of the soil; therefore in most cases the\r\nphosphoric acid disseminated through the soil is amply sufficient to\r\nmeet the requirements of the wheat crop; whilst turnips, depending on a\r\nthinner depth of soil during their shorter period of growth, cannot\r\nassimilate sufficient phosphoric acid, to come to perfection.’ This is,\r\nI believe, the main reason why the direct supply of readily available\r\nphosphates is so beneficial to root-crops, and not to wheat.”\r\n\r\n“This reason,” said I, “has never been entirely satisfactory to me. If\r\nthe roots of the turnip have such a limited range, how are they able to\r\nget such a large amount of potash?\r\n\r\n“It is probable that the turnip, containing such a large relative amount\r\nof potash and so little phosphoric acid, has roots capable of absorbing\r\npotash from a very weak solution, but not so in regard to phosphoric\r\nacid.”\r\n\r\n“There is another way of looking at this matter,” said the Doctor. “You\r\nmust recollect that, if turnips and wheat were growing in the same\r\nfield, both plants get their food from the same solution. And instead of\r\nsupposing that the wheat-plant has the power of taking up more\r\nphosphoric acid than the turnip-plant, we may suppose that the turnip\r\nhas the power of rejecting or excluding a portion of phosphoric acid. It\r\ntakes up no more potash than the wheat-plant, but it takes _less_\r\nphosphoric acid.”\r\n\r\nBut it is not necessary to speculate on this matter. For the present we\r\nmay accept the fact, that the proportion of potash, phosphoric acid, and\r\nnitrogen in the crop is no indication of the proper proportion in which\r\nthese ingredients should be applied to the soil for these crops in\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nIt may well be that we should use special manures for special crops; but\r\nwe must ascertain what these manures should be, not from analyses of the\r\ncrops to be grown, but from experiment and experience.\r\n\r\nSo far as present facts throw light on this subject, we should conclude\r\nthat those crops which contain the _least_ nitrogen are the most likely\r\nto be benefited by its artificial application; and the crops containing\r\nthe most phosphoric acid, are the crops to which, in ordinary practical\r\nagriculture, it will be unprofitable to apply superphosphate of lime.\r\n\r\n“That,” said the Doctor, “may be stating the case a little too strong.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” said I, “but you must recollect I am now speaking of\r\npractical agriculture. If I wanted to raise a good crop of cabbage,\r\nI should not think of consulting a chemical analysis of the cabbage. If\r\nI set out cabbage on an acre of land, which, without manure, would\r\nproduce 16 tons of cabbage, does any one mean to tell me that if I put\r\nthe amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash which 10 tons of\r\ncabbage contain, on an adjoining acre, that it would produce an extra\r\ngrowth of 10 tons of cabbage. I can not believe it. The facts are all\r\nthe other way. Plant growth is not such a simple matter as the advocates\r\nof this theory, if there be any at this late day, would have us\r\nbelieve.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF FERTILIZERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1857, Prof. S. W. Johnson, in his Report to the Connecticut\r\nAgricultural Society, adopted the following valuation:\r\n\r\n  Potash                                4   cents per lb.\r\n  Phosphoric acid, insoluble in water   4½    ”    ”   ”\r\n      ”       ”    soluble   ”    ”    12½    ”    ”   ”\r\n  Nitrogen                             17     ”    ”   ”\r\n\r\nAnalyses of many of the leading commercial fertilizers at that time\r\nshowed that, when judged by this standard, the price charged was far\r\nabove their actual value. In some cases, manures selling for $60 per\r\nton, contained nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash worth only from $20\r\nto $25 per ton. And one well-known manure, which sold for $28 per ton,\r\nwas found to be worth only $2.33 per ton. A Bone Fertilizer selling at\r\n$50 per ton, was worth less than $14 per ton.\r\n\r\n“In 1852,” said the Doctor, “superphosphate of lime was manufactured by\r\nthe New Jersey Zinc Co., and sold in New York at $50 per ton of 2,000\r\nlbs. At the same time, superphosphate of lime made from Coprolites, was\r\nselling in England for $24 per ton of 2,240 lbs. The late Prof. Mapes\r\ncommenced making “Improved Superphosphate of Lime,” at Newark, N.J., in\r\n1852, and Mr. De Burg, the same year, made a plain superphosphate of\r\nlime in Brooklyn, N.Y. The price, in proportion to value, was high, and,\r\nin fact, the same may be said of many of our superphosphate manures,\r\nuntil within the last few years.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the comparatively high price, and the uncertain quality\r\nof these commercial manures, the demand has been steadily on the\r\nincrease. We have now many honorable and intelligent men engaged in the\r\nmanufacture and sale of these artificial manures, and owing to more\r\ndefinite knowledge on the part of the manufacturers and of the\r\npurchasers, it is not a difficult matter to find manures well worth the\r\nmoney asked for them.\r\n\r\n“A correct analysis,” said I, “furnishes the only sure test of value.\r\n‘Testimonials’ from farmers and others are pre-eminently unreliable.\r\nWith over thirty years’ experience in the use of these fertilizers,\r\nI would place far more confidence on a good and reliable analysis than\r\non any actual trial I could make in the field. Testimonials to a patent\r\nfertilizer are about as reliable as testimonials to a patent-medicine.\r\nIn buying a manure, we want to know what it contains, and the condition\r\nof the constituents.”\r\n\r\nIn 1877, Prof. S. W. Johnson gives the following figures, showing “the\r\ntrade-values, or cost in market, per pound, of the ordinary occurring\r\nforms of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, as recently found in the\r\nNew York and New England markets:\r\n                                                        _Cents\r\n                                                        per pound._\r\n  Nitrogen in ammonia and nitrates                          24\r\n     ”     in Peruvian Guano, fine steamed bone, dried\r\n             and fine ground blood, meat, and fish          20\r\n     ”     in fine ground bone, horn, and wool-dust         18\r\n     ”     in coarse bone, horn-shavings, and fish-scrap    15\r\n  Phosphoric acid soluble in water                          12½\r\n     ”        ”   “reverted,” and in Peruvian Guano          9\r\n     ”        ”   insoluble, in fine bone and fish guano     7\r\n     ”        ”      ”    in coarse bone, bone-ash,\r\n                            and bone-black                   5\r\n     ”        ”      ”    in fine ground rock phosphate      3½\r\n  Potash in high-grade sulphate                              9\r\n    ”    in kainit, as sulphate                              7½\r\n    ”    in muriate, or potassium chloride                   6\r\n\r\n“These ‘estimated values,’” says Prof. Johnson, “are not fixed, but vary\r\nwith the state of the market, and are from time to time subject to\r\nrevision. They are not exact to the cent or its fractions, because the\r\nsame article sells cheaper at commercial or manufacturing centers than\r\nin country towns, cheaper in large lots than in small, cheaper for cash\r\nthan on time. These values are high enough to do no injustice to the\r\ndealer, and accurate enough to serve the object of the consumer.\r\n\r\n“By multiplying the per cent of Nitrogen, etc., by the trade-value per\r\npound, and then by 20, we get the value per ton of the several\r\ningredients, and adding the latter together, we obtain the total\r\nestimated value per ton.\r\n\r\n“The uses of the ‘Valuation’ are, 1st, to show whether a given lot or\r\nbrand of fertilizer is worth as a commodity of trade what it costs. If\r\nthe selling price is no higher than the estimated value, the purchaser\r\nmay he quite sure that the price is reasonable. If the selling price is\r\nbut $2 to $3 per ton more than the estimated value, it may still be a\r\nfair price, but if the cost per ton is $5 or more over the estimated\r\nvalue, it would be well to look further. 2d, Comparisons of the\r\nestimated values, and selling prices of a number of fertilizers will\r\ngenerally indicate fairly which is the best for the money. But the\r\n‘estimated value’ is not to be too literally construed, for analysis\r\ncannot always decide accurately what is the _form_ of nitrogen, etc.,\r\nwhile the mechanical condition of a fertilizer is an item whose\r\ninfluence cannot always be rightly expressed or appreciated.\r\n\r\n“The _Agricultural value_ of a fertilizer is measured by the benefit\r\nreceived from its use, and depends upon its fertilizing effect, or\r\ncrop-producing power. As a broad general rule it is true that Peruvian\r\nguano, superphosphates, fish-scraps, dried blood, potash salts, plaster,\r\netc., have a high agricultural value which is related to their\r\ntrade-value, and to a degree determines the latter value. But the rule\r\nhas many exceptions, and in particular instances the trade-value cannot\r\nalways be expected to fix or even to indicate the agricultural value.\r\nFertilizing effect depends largely upon soil, crop, and weather, and as\r\nthese vary from place to place, and from year to year, it cannot be\r\nforetold or estimated except by the results of past experience, and then\r\nonly in a general and probable manner.”\r\n\r\n“It will be seen,” said the Doctor, “that Prof. Johnson places a higher\r\nvalue on potash now than he did 20 years ago. He retains the same\r\nfigures for soluble phosphoric acid, and makes a very just and proper\r\ndiscrimination between the different values of different forms of\r\nnitrogen and phosphoric acid.”\r\n\r\n“The prices,” said I, “are full as high as farmers can afford to pay.\r\nBut there is not much probability that we shall see them permanently\r\nreduced. The tendency is in the other direction. In a public address\r\nMr. J. B. Lawes has recently remarked: ‘A future generation of British\r\nfarmers will doubtless hear with some surprise that, at the close of the\r\nmanure season of 1876, there were 40,000 tons of nitrate of soda in our\r\ndocks, which could not find purchasers, although the price did not\r\nexceed £12 or £13 per ton.’”\r\n\r\n“He evidently thinks,” said the Doctor, “that available nitrogen is\r\ncheaper now than it will be in years to come.”\r\n\r\n“Nitrate of soda,” said I, “at the prices named, is only 2½ to 2¾ cents\r\nper lb., and the nitrogen it contains would cost less than 18 cents per\r\nlb., instead of 24 cents, as given by Prof. Johnson.”\r\n\r\n“No. 1 Peruvian Guano, ‘guaranteed,’ is now sold,” said the Doctor, “at\r\na price per ton, to be determined by its composition, at the following\r\nrates:\r\n                                   _Value per pound._\r\n  Nitrogen (ammonia, 17½ c.)             21¾ c.\r\n  Soluble phosphoric acid                10  c.\r\n  Reverted    ”       ”                   8  c.\r\n  Insoluble   ”       ”                   2  c.\r\n  Potash, as sulphate and phosphate       7½ c.\r\n\r\n“The first cargo of Peruvian guano, sold under this guarantee,\r\ncontained:\r\n\r\n                                            _Value per ton_.\r\n  Ammonia                    6.8 per cent         $23.80\r\n  Soluble phosphoric acid    3.8  ”  ”              7.60\r\n  Reverted    ”       ”     11.5  ”  ”             18.40\r\n  Insoluble   ”       ”      3.0  ”  ”              1.20\r\n  Potash                     3.7  ”  ”              5.55\r\n                                                  ------\r\n  Estimated retail price per ton of 2,000 lbs.    $56.55\r\n  Marked on bags for sale                         $56.00\r\n\r\nThe second cargo, sold under this guarantee, contained:\r\n\r\n                                           _Value per ton_.\r\n  Ammonia                   11.5 per cent        $40.50\r\n  Soluble phosphoric acid    5.4  ”   ”           10.80\r\n  Reverted    ”       ”     10.0  ”   ”           16.00\r\n  Insoluble   ”       ”      1.7  ”   ”             .68\r\n  Potash                     2.3  ”   ”            3.45\r\n                                                 ------\r\n                                                 $71.43\r\n  Selling price marked on bags                   $70.00\r\n\r\n“It is interesting,” said I, “to compare these analyses of Peruvian\r\nguano of to-day, with Peruvian guano brought to England twenty-nine or\r\nthirty years ago. I saw at Rothamsted thirty years ago a bag of guano\r\nthat contained 22 per cent of ammonia. And farmers could then buy guano\r\nguaranteed by the dealers (not by the agents of the Peruvian\r\nGovernment), to contain 16 per cent of ammonia, and 10 per cent of\r\nphosphoric acid.

Its value at\r\nthe present rates we may estimate as follows:\r\n\r\n  Ammonia, 7½ per cent                     $26.25\r\n  Soluble Phosphoric acid,  4 per cent       8.00\r\n  Reverted     ”      ”    10    ”          16.00\r\n                                           ------\r\n                                           $50.25\r\n  Selling price per ton of 2,000 lbs.      $21.80\r\n\r\nThe potash is not given, or this would probably add four or five dollars\r\nto its estimated value.\r\n\r\n“All of which goes to show,” said the Deacon, “that the Peruvian\r\nGovernment is asking, in proportion to value, from two to two and a half\r\ntimes as much for guano as was charged twenty-five or thirty years ago.\r\nThat first cargo of guano, sold in New York under the new guarantee, in\r\n1877, for $56 per ton, is worth no more than the Ichaboe guano sold in\r\nEngland in 1845, for less than $22 per ton!\r\n\r\n“And furthermore,” continued the Deacon, “from all that I can learn, the\r\nguano of the present day is not only far poorer in nitrogen than it was\r\nformerly, but the nitrogen is not as soluble, and consequently not so\r\nvaluable, pound for pound. Much of the guano of the present day bears\r\nabout the same relation to genuine old-fashioned guano, as leached ashes\r\ndo to unleached, or as a ton of manure that has been leached in the\r\nbarn-yard does to a ton that has been kept under cover.”\r\n\r\n“True, to a certain extent,” said the Doctor, “but you must recollect\r\nthat this ‘guaranteed’ guano is now sold by analysis. You pay for what\r\nyou get and no more.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said the Deacon, “but what you get is not so good. A pound of\r\nnitrogen in the leached guano is not as available or as valuable as a\r\npound of nitrogen in the unleached guano. And this fact ought to be\r\nunderstood.”\r\n\r\n“One thing,” said I, “seems clear. The Peruvian Government is charging a\r\nconsiderably higher price for guano, in proportion to its actual value,\r\nthan was charged 20 or 25 years ago. It may be, that the guano is still\r\nthe cheapest manure in the market, but at any rate the price is higher\r\nthan formerly--while there has been no corresponding advance in the\r\nprice of produce in the markets of the world.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASH AS A MANURE.\r\n\r\nOn land where fish, fish-scrap, or guano, has been used freely for some\r\nyears, and the crops exported from the farm, we may expect a relative\r\ndeficiency of potash in the soil. In such a case, an application of\r\nunleached ashes or potash-salts will be likely to produce a decided\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nClay or loamy land is usually richer in potash than soils of a more\r\nsandy or gravelly character. And on poor sandy land, the use of fish or\r\nof guano, if the crops are all sold, will be soon likely to prove of\r\nlittle benefit owing to a deficiency of potash in the soil. They may\r\nproduce good crops for a few years, but the larger the crops produced\r\n_and sold_, the more would the soil become deficient in potash.\r\n\r\nWe have given the particulars of Lawes and Gilbert’s experiments on\r\nbarley. Mr. Lawes at a late meeting in London, stated that “he had grown\r\n25 crops of barley one after the other with nitrogen, either as ammonia\r\nor nitrate of soda, but without potash, and that by the use of potash\r\nthey had produced practically no better result. This year (1877), for\r\nthe first time, the potash had failed a little, and they had now\r\nproduced 10 or 12 bushels more per acre with potash than without,\r\nshowing that they were coming to the end of the available potash in the\r\nsoil. This year (1877), they obtained 54 bushels of barley with potash,\r\nand 42 bushels without it. Of course, this was to be expected, and they\r\nhad expected it much sooner. The same with wheat; he expected the end\r\nwould come in a few years, but they had now gone on between 30 and 40\r\nyears. When the end came they would not be sorry, because then they\r\nwould have the knowledge they were seeking for.”\r\n\r\nDr. Vœlcker, at the same meeting remarked: “Many soils contained from 1½\r\nto 2 per cent of available potash, and a still larger quantity locked\r\nup, in the shape of minerals, which only gradually came into play; but\r\nthe quantity of potash carried off in crops did not exceed 2 cwt. per\r\nacre, if so much. Now 0.1 per cent of any constituent, calculated on a\r\ndepth of six inches, was equivalent to one ton per acre. Therefore, if a\r\nsoil contained only 0.1 per cent of potash, a ton of potash might be\r\ncarried off from a depth of 6 inches. But you had not only 0.1 per cent,\r\nbut something like 1½ per cent and upwards in many soils. It is quite\r\ntrue there were many soils from which you could not continuously take\r\ncrops without restoring the potash.”\r\n\r\n“In all of which,” said the Doctor, “there is nothing new. It does not\r\nhelp us to determine whether potash is or is not deficient in our soil.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said I, “can be ascertained only by actual experiment. Put a\r\nlittle hen-manure on a row of corn, and on another row a little\r\nhen-manure and ashes, and on another row, ashes alone, and leave one row\r\nwithout anything. On my farm I am satisfied that we need not buy\r\npotash-salts for manure. I do not say they would do no good, for they\r\nmay do good on land not deficient in available potash, just as lime will\r\ndo good on land containing large quantities of lime. But potash is not\r\nwhat my land needs to make it produce maximum crops. It needs available\r\nnitrogen, and possibly soluble phosphoric acid.”\r\n\r\nThe system of farming adopted in this section, is much more likely to\r\nimpoverish the soil of nitrogen and phosphoric acid than of potash.\r\n\r\nIf a soil is deficient in potash, the crop which will first indicate the\r\ndeficiency, will probably be clover, or beans. Farmers who can grow\r\nlarge crops of red-clover, need not buy potash for manure.\r\n\r\nOn farms where grain is largely raised and sold, and where the straw,\r\nand corn-stalks, and hay, and the hay from clover-seed are retained on\r\nthe farm, and this strawy manure returned to the land, the soil will\r\nbecome poor from the lack of nitrogen and phosphoric acid long before\r\nthere would be any need of an artificial supply of potash.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if farmers should use fish, or guano, or\r\nsuperphosphate, or nitrate of soda, and sell all the hay, and straw, and\r\npotatoes, and root-crops, they could raise, many of our sandy soils\r\nwould soon become poor in available potash. But even in this case the\r\nclover and beans would show the deficiency sooner than wheat or even\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\n“And yet we are told,” said the Deacon, “that potatoes contain no end of\r\npotash.”\r\n\r\n“And the same is true,” said I, “of root-crops, such as mangel-wurzel,\r\nturnips, etc., but the fact has no other significance than this: If you\r\ngrow potatoes for many years on the same land and manure them with\r\nnitrogenous manures, the soil is likely to be speedily impoverished of\r\npotash.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose,” said the Deacon, “that you grow potatoes on the same land\r\nwithout manure of any kind, would not the soil become equally poor in\r\npotash?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said I, “because you would, in such a case, get very small\r\ncrops--small, not from lack of potash, but from lack of nitrogen. If I\r\nhad land which had grown corn, potatoes, wheat, oats, and hay, for many\r\nyears without manure, or an occasional dressing of our common\r\nbarnyard-manure, and wanted it to produce a good crop of potatoes,\r\nI should not expect to get it by simply applying potash. The soil might\r\nbe poor in potash, but it is almost certain to be still poorer in\r\nnitrogen and phosphoric acid.”\r\n\r\nLand that has been manured with farm-yard or stable-manure for years, no\r\nmatter how it has been cropped, is not likely to need potash. The manure\r\nis richer in potash than in nitrogen and phosphoric acid. And the same\r\nmay be said of the soil.\r\n\r\nIf a farmer uses nitrogenous and phosphatic manures on his clayey or\r\nloamy land that is usually relatively rich in potash, and will apply his\r\ncommon manure to the sandy parts of the farm, he will rarely need to\r\npurchase manures containing potash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nRESTORING FERTILITY TO THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nBy Sir J. B. Lawes, Bart., LL.D., F.R.S., Rothamsted, Eng.\r\n\r\n\r\nA relation of mine, who already possessed a very considerable estate,\r\nconsisting of light land, about twenty years ago purchased a large\r\nproperty adjoining it at a very high price. These were days when farmers\r\nwere flourishing, and they no more anticipated what was in store for\r\nthem in the future, than the inhabitants of the earth in the days of\r\nNoah.\r\n\r\nTimes have changed since then, and bad seasons, low prices of wheat, and\r\ncattle-disease, have swept off the tenants from these two estates, so\r\nthat my relation finds himself now in the position of being the unhappy\r\nowner and occupier of five or six farms, extending over several thousand\r\nacres--one farm alone occupying an area of two thousand four hundred\r\nacres. Fortunately for the owner, he possesses town property in addition\r\nto his landed estates, so that the question with him is not, as it is\r\nwith many land owners, how to find the necessary capital to cultivate\r\nthe land, but, having found the capital, how to expend it in farming, so\r\nas to produce a proper return.\r\n\r\nIt is not very surprising that, under these circumstances, my opinion\r\nshould have been asked. What, indeed, would have been the use of a\r\nrelation, who not only spent all his time in agricultural experiments,\r\nbut also pretended to teach our neighbors how to farm on the other side\r\nof the Atlantic, if he could not bring his science to bear on the land\r\nof an adjoining county! Here is the land--my relation might naturally\r\nsay--here is the money, and I have so much confidence in your capacity\r\nthat I will give you _carte-blanche_ to spend as much as you\r\nplease--what am I to do?\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the property brought out the following facts--that all\r\nthe land was very light, and that you might walk over the fresh plowed\r\nsurface in the wettest weather without any clay sticking to your boots:\r\nstill a portion of the soil was dark in color, and therefore probably\r\ncontained a sufficient amount of fertility to make cultivation\r\nprofitable, provided the management could be conducted with that care\r\nand economy which are absolute essentials in a business where the\r\nexpenditure is always pressing closely upon the income.\r\n\r\nUpon land of this description meat-making is the backbone of the system,\r\nwhich must be adopted, and a large breeding flock of sheep the first\r\nessential towards success.\r\n\r\nScience can make very little improvement upon the four-course\r\nrotation--roots, barley, clover, and wheat, unless, perhaps, it may be\r\nby keeping the land in clover, or mixed grass and clover, for two or\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nA good deal of the land I was inspecting was so light, that, in fact, it\r\nwas hardly more than sand, and for some years it had been left to grow\r\nanything that came up, undisturbed by the plow.\r\n\r\nTo a practised eye, the character of the natural vegetation is a sure\r\nindication of the fertility of the soil. Where herds of buffaloes are to\r\nbe seen--their sides shaking with fat--it is quite evident that the\r\npastures upon which they feed cannot be very bad; and in the same way,\r\nwhere a rank growth of weeds is found springing up upon land that has\r\nbeen abandoned, it may be taken for certain that the elements of food\r\nexist in the soil. This ground was covered with vegetation, but of the\r\nmost impoverished description, even the “Quack” or “Couch-grass” could\r\nnot form a regular carpet, but grew in small, detached bunches;\r\neverything, in fact, bore evidence of poverty.\r\n\r\nPossibly, the first idea which might occur to any one, on seeing land in\r\nthis state, might be: Why not grow the crops by the aid of artificial\r\nmanures?\r\n\r\nLet us look at the question from two points of view: first, in regard to\r\nthe cost of the ingredients; and, secondly, in regard to the growth of\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with wheat. A crop of wheat, machine-reaped, contains, as\r\ncarted to the stack, about six pounds of soil ingredients in every one\r\nhundred pounds; that is to say, each five pounds of mineral matter, and\r\nrather less than one pound of nitrogen, which the plant takes from the\r\nsoil, will enable it to obtain ninety-four pounds of other substances\r\nfrom the atmosphere. To grow a crop of twenty bushels of grain and two\r\nthousand pounds of straw, would require one hundred and sixty pounds of\r\nminerals, and about thirty-two pounds of nitrogen; of the one hundred\r\nand sixty pounds of minerals, one-half would be silica, of which the\r\nsoil possesses already more than enough; the remainder, consisting of\r\nabout eighty pounds of potash and phosphate, could be furnished for from\r\nthree to four dollars, and the thirty-two pounds of nitrogen could be\r\npurchased in nitrate of soda for six or eight dollars. The actual cost\r\nof the ingredients, therefore, in the crop of twenty bushels of wheat,\r\nwould be about ten to twelve dollars. But as this manure would furnish\r\nthe ingredients for the growth of both straw and grain, and it is\r\ncustomary to return the straw to the land, after the first crop, fully\r\none-third of the cost of the manure might, in consequence, be deducted,\r\nwhich would make the ingredients of the twenty bushels amount to six\r\ndollars. Twenty bushels of wheat in England would sell for twenty-eight\r\ndollars; therefore, there would be twenty-two dollars left for the cost\r\nof cultivation and profit.\r\n\r\nA French writer on scientific agriculture has employed figures very\r\nsimilar to the above, to show how French farmers may grow wheat at less\r\nthan one dollar per bushel. At this price they might certainly defy the\r\ncompetition of the United States. It is one thing, however, to grow\r\ncrops in a lecture room, and quite another to grow them in a field. In\r\ndealing with artificial manures, furnishing phosphoric acid, potash, and\r\nnitrogen, we have substances which act upon the soil in very different\r\nways. Phosphate of lime is a very insoluble substance, and requires an\r\nenormous amount of water to dissolve it. Salts of potash, on the other\r\nhand, are very soluble in water, but form very insoluble compounds with\r\nthe soil. Salts of ammonia and nitrate of soda are perfectly soluble in\r\nwater. When applied to the land, the ammonia of the former substance\r\nforms an insoluble compound with the soil, but in a very short time is\r\nconverted into nitrate of lime; and with this salt and nitrate of soda,\r\nremains in solution in the soil water until they are either taken up by\r\nthe plant or are washed away into the drains or rivers.\r\n\r\nCrops evaporate a very large amount of water, and with this water they\r\nattract the soluble nitrate from all parts of the soil. Very favorable\r\nseasons are therefore those in which the soil is neither too dry nor too\r\nwet; as in one case the solution of nitrate becomes dried up in the\r\nsoil, in the other it is either washed away, or the soil remains so wet\r\nthat the plant cannot evaporate the water sufficiently to draw up the\r\nnitrates which it contains.\r\n\r\nThe amount of potash and phosphoric acid dissolved in the water is far\r\ntoo small to supply the requirements of the plant, and it is probable\r\nthat what is required for this purpose is dissolved by some direct\r\naction of the roots of the plant on coming in contact with the insoluble\r\nphosphoric acid and potash in the soil.\r\n\r\nIn support of this view, I may mention that we have clear evidence in\r\nsome of our experiments of the wheat crop taking up both phosphates and\r\npotash that were applied to the land thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nTo suppose, therefore, that, if the ingredients which exist in twenty\r\nbushels of wheat and its straw, are simply applied to a barren soil, the\r\ncrop will be able to come in contact with, and take up these substances,\r\nis to assume what certainly will not take place.\r\n\r\nI have often expressed an opinion that arable land, could not be\r\ncultivated profitably by means of artificial manures, unless the soil\r\nwas capable of producing, from its own resources, a considerable amount\r\nof produce; still the question had never up to this time come before me\r\nin a distinct form as one upon which I had to decide one way or the\r\nother. I had, however, no hesitation in coming to the conclusion, that\r\ngrain crops could never be grown at a profit upon my relation’s land,\r\nand that consequently, for some years, it would be better to give up the\r\nattempt, and try to improve the pasture.\r\n\r\nAfter what I have said about the insolubility of potash and phosphoric\r\nacid, it may possibly be asked--why not give a good dose of these\r\nsubstances at once, as they do not wash out of the soil--say enough to\r\ngrow sixty crops of grain, and apply the nitrate, or ammonia every year\r\nin just sufficient amounts to supply the wants of the crop?\r\n\r\nThe objections to this plan are as follows: assuming the most favorable\r\nconditions of climate, and the largest possible produce, the wheat could\r\ncertainly not take up the whole of the thirty-two pounds of nitrogen\r\napplied, and the crop which requires nearly one pound of nitrogen in\r\nevery one hundred pounds of gross produce, would be certainly less than\r\nthree thousand two hundred pounds, if supplied with only thirty-two\r\npounds of nitrogen. If we take the total produce of the best and worst\r\nwheat crop, grown during the forty years of our experiments, we shall\r\narrive at a better understanding in the matter. The following are the\r\nfigures:\r\n\r\n  Weight of Dry Produce of Wheat Per Acre.\r\n\r\n         _Straw and Grain._\r\n  1863         9330 lbs.\r\n  1879         3859  ”\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the increase due to the nitrogen of the salts of\r\nammonia or nitrate of soda, we must deduct from the crop the produce\r\nobtained, where mineral manures without nitrogen were used. In 1863 this\r\namount was three thousand pounds, and in 1879 it was one thousand two\r\nhundred pounds. Deducting these amounts from the gross produce in each\r\ncase, leaves six thousand three hundred and thirty as the produce due to\r\nthe nitrogen in the season of 1863, and two thousand six hundred and\r\nfifty-nine as the produce due to the nitrogen in 1879.\r\n\r\nBut in each case we applied the same amount of nitrogen, eighty-seven\r\npounds; and as the amount of nitrogen in a wheat crop, as carted from\r\nthe field, contains less than one per cent. of nitrogen, it is evident\r\nthat if all that was contained in the manure had been taken up by the\r\nplant, the increased crop should have weighed eight thousand seven\r\nhundred pounds instead of six thousand three hundred and thirty. Thus\r\neven in our best year, some of the nitrogen applied failed to produce\r\ngrowth; and when we come to the bad year we find that only twenty-six\r\nand a half pounds were taken up out of the eighty-seven pounds applied,\r\nthus leaving more than two-thirds of the whole unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nSeasons are only occasionally either very bad or very good. What we call\r\nan average season does not differ very much from the mean of the best\r\nand worst years, which in this case would be represented by a crop of\r\nfour thousand four hundred and ninety-four pounds, containing nearly\r\nforty-five pounds of nitrogen. I may say that, although I have employed\r\none per cent. to avoid fractions in my calculations, strictly speaking\r\nthree-quarters of a per cent. would more nearly represent the real\r\nquantity. If, however, on the average, we only obtain about forty-five\r\npounds from an application of about eighty-seven pounds of nitrogen, it\r\nis evident that not more than one-half of the amount applied enters into\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\nNow in dealing with a substance of so costly a nature as ammonia, or\r\nnitrate of soda--the nitrogen contained in which substances cannot cost\r\nmuch less than twenty-five cents per pound by the time it is spread upon\r\nthe land, it becomes a question of importance to know what becomes of\r\nthe other half, or the residue whatever it may be, which has not been\r\ntaken up by the crop. Part is undoubtedly taken up by the weeds which\r\ngrow with the wheat, and after the wheat has been cut. Part sinks into\r\nthe sub-soil and is washed completely away during the winter.\r\n\r\nI, myself, am disposed to think that the very great difference in the\r\nsize of the Indian corn crops, as compared with the wheat crops in the\r\nStates, is partly accounted for by their greater freedom from weeds,\r\nwhich are large consumers of nitric acid, and, in the case of the wheat\r\ncrop, frequently reduce the yield by several bushels per acre. It must,\r\nhowever, be borne in mind that, though the wheat is robbed of its food\r\nwhere there are weeds, still if there were no weeds, the amount of\r\nnitric acid which the crop could not get hold of, would, in all\r\nprobability, be washed out of the soil during the ensuing winter. I come\r\nto the conclusion, therefore, that the nitrogen alone, which would be\r\nrequired to produce one bushel of wheat, would cost not much less than\r\nfifty cents; and that, in consequence, wheat-growing by means of\r\nartificial manures, will not pay upon very poor land.\r\n\r\nI have said that the land, about which I was consulted, had not been\r\nplowed for several years, and that although nature had done all she\r\ncould to clothe the soil with vegetation, the most disheartening feature\r\nin the case was, the poverty of the weeds. A thistle may be a giant or a\r\ndwarf, according to circumstances; here they were all dwarfs. The\r\nplaintain, which I believe is sometimes sown in these districts for\r\nfood, has a very deep root; here the plants were abundant, but the\r\nleaves were very small and lay so close to the ground, that, as the\r\nmanager informed me, “the sheep were often injured from the amount of\r\nsand which they swallowed with the leaves when feeding.”\r\n\r\nAt Rothamsted, the analyses of the rain water passing through the\r\nordinary soil of one of my fields, which has been kept free from\r\nvegetation, have shown that the amount of nitric acid liberated in a\r\nsoil, and washed out each year, is very large. Taking the ten years\r\nduring which these special experiments have been in progress, I should\r\nthink that the loss of nitrogen would be equal to, or possibly exceed,\r\nthe amount of that substance removed by the average crops grown in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by the rain gauges, are further completely\r\nconfirmed by those in an adjoining field, where wheat and fallow have\r\nbeen grown alternately for twenty-seven years. The liberation of nitric\r\nacid, during the year of rest, produced for a time a large growth of\r\nwheat, but it was done at a very great waste of the fertility of the\r\nsoil, and the produce is now, in proportion, considerably lower than\r\nthat grown on the continuously unmanured land.\r\n\r\nThese results, if they are to be accepted as correct, must bring about a\r\nvery considerable change in the generally received views in regard to\r\nfertility. We not only see more clearly the connection between a former\r\nvegetation and the stored up fertility in our soil, but we also see the\r\nimportance of vegetation at the present day, as the only means by which\r\nthe loss of nitric acid is prevented. The more completely the land is\r\ncovered with vegetation, and the more growth there is, the greater will\r\nbe the evaporation of water, and the less will be the loss of nitric\r\nacid by drainage.\r\n\r\nI was not at all surprised to find, that the surface soil of a wood on\r\nmy farm, was poorer in nitrogen than the soil of an old permanent\r\npasture, to which no manure had been applied for twenty-five years,\r\nthough during the whole period, the crop of hay had been removed every\r\nyear from the land. The wood to which I refer is covered with oak,\r\ncenturies old, and the foliage is so dense that but little underwood or\r\nother vegetation can grow beneath it. If both the wood and the pasture\r\nwere put into arable cultivation, I have no doubt that the pasture would\r\nprove much more fertile than the wood land.\r\n\r\nIn our experiments on permanent pasture, it has been observed that the\r\ncharacter of the herbage is mainly dependent on the food supplied.\r\nWeeds, and inferior grasses, can hold their own as long as poverty\r\nexists, but with a liberal supply of manure, the superior grasses\r\novergrow and drive out the bad grasses and weeds. In consequence of the\r\nlow price of wheat a good deal of land in England has been laid down to\r\npermanent pasture, and much money has been spent in cleaning the land\r\npreparatory to sowing the grass-seeds. I have on more occasions than\r\none, suggested that the money employed in this process would be better\r\nexpended in manure, by which the weeds would be “improved” off the face\r\nof the land. While walking over the abandoned portion of these estates I\r\nexplained my views upon this point to the manager. They were, however,\r\nreceived with the usual skepticism, and the rejoinder that “there was\r\nonly one way of getting rid of the weeds, which was by the plow and\r\nfire.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that speaks to me so forcibly as color in vegetation;\r\nwhen travelling by rail, I do not require to be told that such a farm\r\nis, or is not, in high condition, or that we are passing through a\r\nfertile or infertile district. There is a peculiar green color in\r\nvegetation which is an unmistakable sign that it is living upon the fat\r\nof the land. I need hardly say that, in this case, the color of the\r\nvegetation gave unmistakable signs of the poverty of the soil; but in\r\nthe midst of the dingy yellowish-green of the herbage, I came upon one\r\nsquare of bright green grass. In answer to my enquiry I was told that,\r\na “lambing-fold had been there last year,” and my informant added his\r\nopinion, “that the manure would be so strong that it would kill\r\nanything!” It had certainly killed the weeds, but in their place, some\r\ngood grasses had taken possession of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe plan I proposed to adopt was, to spend no more money on tillage\r\noperations, but to endeavor to improve the pasture by giving to it the\r\nfood necessary to grow good grasses, sowing at the same time a small\r\nquantity of the best seeds. I further suggested that a flock of sheep\r\nshould be allowed to run over the whole of the land by day, and be\r\nfolded there every night--about one pound of cotton-seed cake per head\r\nbeing allowed daily. By this means, as the fold would be moved every\r\nday, the amount of manure deposited on the soil could be estimated.\r\n\r\nIf there were a hundred sheep, receiving one pound of decorticated\r\ncotton-seed cake per head, daily, and the hurdles were arranged to\r\nenclose a space of twenty-five by twenty yards, in the course of ten\r\ndays an acre of land would have received manure from one thousand pounds\r\nof cake; which amount would supply seventy-seven pounds of nitrogen,\r\nsixty-eight pounds of phosphate of lime, and thirty-two pounds of\r\npotash. This amount of cake would cost about sixteen dollars.\r\n\r\nAs regards the value of the cake as a food, it is somewhat difficult to\r\nform an estimate; but it takes nine or ten pounds of dry food--say\r\nroots, cake, and hay--to produce an increase of one pound of live weight\r\nin sheep. The cake has certainly a higher feeding value, than either hay\r\nor roots, but I will here give it only the same value, and consider that\r\none hundred and ten pounds of increase of the animal was obtained by the\r\nconsumption of the one thousand pounds of cake. The value of the\r\nincrease of the live weight would be in England fully eleven dollars,\r\nleaving five dollars as the cost of the manure. Now the cake furnished\r\nseventy-seven pounds of nitrogen alone, which, if purchased in an\r\nartificial manure, would have cost nineteen dollars; and the other\r\nsubstances supplied by the cake, would have cost from four to five\r\ndollars more. The manures required, therefore, would be obtained much\r\nmore cheaply by this than by any other process.\r\n\r\nLabor would be saved by not cultivating the land. Manure would be saved\r\nby substituting vegetation which grows under or above ground, almost all\r\nthe year round. And, by feeding the stock with cake, the necessary\r\nfertility would be obtained at the lowest possible cost.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the land would require this treatment to be repeated\r\nfor several years, before there would be a fair growth of grass. The\r\nland might then be broken up and one grain crop be taken, then it might\r\nagain be laid down to grass.\r\n\r\nHitherto, I have considered a case where fertility is almost absent from\r\nthe land, this, however, is an exception, as agriculture generally is\r\ncarried on upon soils which contain large stores of fertility, though\r\nthey may be very unequally distributed. By analysis of the soil we can\r\nmeasure the total amount of fertility which it contains, but we are left\r\nin ignorance in regard to the amount of the ingredients which are in\r\nsuch a form that the crops we cultivate can make use of them.\r\n\r\nAt Rothamsted, among my experiments on the growth of continuous wheat,\r\nat the end of forty years, the soil supplied with salts of ammonia has\r\nyielded, during the whole time, and still continues to yield, a larger\r\nproduce than is obtained by a liberal supply of phosphates and alkaline\r\nsalts without ammonia.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that every one hundred pounds of wheat crop, as carted\r\nto the stack, contains about five per cent. of mineral matter, and one\r\nper cent. of nitrogen, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that my\r\nsoil has a large available balance of mineral substances which the crop\r\ncould not make use of for want of nitrogen. The crop which has received\r\nthese mineral manures now amounts to from twelve to thirteen bushels per\r\nacre, and removes from the land about sixteen pounds of nitrogen every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAnalyses of the soil show that, even after the removal of more than\r\nthirty crops in succession, without any application of manure containing\r\nammonia, the soil still contains some thousands of pounds of nitrogen.\r\nThis nitrogen is in combination with carbon; it is very insoluble in\r\nwater, and until it becomes separated from the carbon, and enters into\r\ncombination with oxygen, does not appear to be of any use to the crop.\r\n\r\nThe combination of nitrogen with oxygen, is known as nitric acid. The\r\nnitric acid enters into combination with the lime of the soil, and in\r\nthis form becomes the food of plants.\r\n\r\nFrom its great importance in regard to the growth of plants, nitric acid\r\nmight be called the main spring of agriculture, but being perfectly\r\nsoluble in water, it is constantly liable to be washed out of the soil.\r\nIn the experiment to which I have referred above--where wheat is grown\r\nby mineral manures alone--we estimate that, of the amount of nitric acid\r\nliberated each year, not much more than one-half is taken up by the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nThe wheat is ripe in July, at which time the land is tolerably free from\r\nweeds; several months, therefore, occur during which there is no\r\nvegetation to take up the nitric acid; and even when the wheat is sown\r\nat the end of October, much nitric acid is liable to be washed away, as\r\nthe power of the plant to take up food from the soil is very limited\r\nuntil the spring.\r\n\r\nThe formation of nitric acid, from the organic nitrogen in the soil, is\r\ndue to the action of a minute plant, and goes on quite independent of\r\nthe growth of our crops. We get, however, in the fact an explanation of\r\nthe extremely different results obtained by the use of different\r\nmanures. One farmer applies lime, or even ground limestone to a soil,\r\nand obtains an increase in his crops; probably he has supplied the very\r\nsubstance which has enabled the nitrification of the organic nitrogen to\r\nincrease; another applies potash, a third phosphates; if either of these\r\nare absent, the crops cannot make use of the nitric acid, however great\r\nmay be the amount diffused through the soil.\r\n\r\nIt may possibly be said that the use of mineral manures tends to exhaust\r\nthe soil of its nitrogen; this may, or may not, be true; but even if the\r\nminerals enable the crop to take up a larger amount of the nitric acid\r\nfound in the soil year by year, this does not increase the exhaustion,\r\nas the minerals only tend to arrest that which otherwise might be washed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWe must look upon the organic nitrogen in the soil, as the main source\r\nof the nitrogen which grows our crops. Whatever may be the amount\r\nderived from the atmosphere, whether in rain, or dew; or from\r\ncondensation by the soil, or plants, it is probable that, where the land\r\nis in arable cultivation, the nitrogen so obtained, is less than the\r\namount washed out of the soil in nitric acid. Upon land which is never\r\nstirred by the plow, there is much less waste and much less activity.\r\n\r\nThe large increase in the area of land laid down to permanent pasture in\r\nEngland, is not due alone to the fall in the price of grain. The\r\nreduction of fertility in many of the soils, which have been long under\r\nthe plow, is beginning to be apparent. Under these circumstances a less\r\nexhausting course of treatment becomes necessary, and pasture, with the\r\nproduction of meat, milk, and butter, takes the place of grain fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Edward Jessop, York, Pa.\r\n\r\n    YORK, PA., March 16, 1876.\r\n\r\n_Joseph Harris, Esq., Moreton Farm, Rochester, N.Y.:_\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--Your favor of the 22d of last month came safely to hand, and I\r\nam truly obliged to you for the reply to my question.--You ask, can I\r\nhelp you with facts or suggestions, on the subject of manure? I fear not\r\nmuch; but it may be useful to you to know what others need to know.\r\nI will look forward to the advent of “Talks on Manures” with much\r\ninterest, hoping to get new light on a subject second to none in\r\nimportance to the farmer.\r\n\r\nI have done a little at composting for some years, and am now having a\r\npile of about forty cords, made up of stable-manure and earth taken from\r\nthe wash of higher lands, turned and fined. The labor of digging and\r\nhauling the earth, composting in thin layers with manure, turning, and\r\nfining, is so great, I doubt whether it pays for most farm crops--this\r\nto be used for mangel-wurzel and market-garden.\r\n\r\nThe usual plan in this county is to keep the stable-manure made during\r\nwinter, and the accumulation of the summer in the barn-yard, where it is\r\nsoaked by rain, and trampled fine by cattle, and in August and September\r\nis hauled upon ground to be seeded with wheat and grass-seeds. I do not\r\nthink there is much piling and turning done.\r\n\r\nMy own conclusions, not based on accurate experiments, however, are,\r\nthat the best manure I have ever applied was prepared in a covered pit\r\non which cattle were allowed to run, and so kept well tramped--some\r\ndrainage into a well, secured by pouring water upon it, when necessary,\r\nand the drainage pumped and distributed over the surface, at short\r\nintervals, particularly the parts not well tramped, and allowed to\r\nremain until it became a homogeneous mass, which it will do without\r\nhaving undergone so active a fermentation as to have thrown off a\r\nconsiderable amount of gas.\r\n\r\nThe next best, composting it with earth, as above described, piled about\r\nfive or six feet high, turned as often as convenient, and kept moist\r\nenough to secure fermentation.\r\n\r\nOr, to throw all the manure as made into a covered pit, until it is\r\nthoroughly mixed and made fine, by allowing hogs to run upon it and root\r\nat will; and when prepared for even spreading, apply it as a\r\ntop-dressing on grass-land--at any convenient time.\r\n\r\nAs to how many loads of fresh manure it takes to make one of well-rotted\r\nmanure, it may be answered approximately, _three to one_, but that would\r\ndepend a good deal on the manner of doing it, and the amount of rough\r\nmaterial in it. If well trodden by cattle under cover, and sufficient\r\ndrainage poured over it, to prevent any violent fermentation, the loss\r\nof weight, I think, would not be very great, nor the bulk lessened over\r\none-half.\r\n\r\nMany years ago an old and successful farmer said to me, “if you want to\r\nget the full benefit of manure, spread it as a top-dressing on some\r\n_growing crop_,” and all my experience and observation since tend to\r\nconfirm the correctness of his advice.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject, allow me to protest against the practice of\r\nnaming the quantity of manure applied to a given space, as so many\r\n_loads_, as altogether too indefinite. The bushel or cord is a definite\r\nquantity, which all can understand.\r\n\r\nThe average price of good livery stable horse-manure at this place has\r\nbeen for several years four dollars a cord.\r\n\r\nWith two and a half miles to haul, I am trying whether keeping a flock\r\nof 50 breeding ewes, and feeding liberally with wheat bran, in addition\r\nto hay and pasture, will not produce the needed manure more cheaply.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n     EDWARD JESSOP.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--You ask for the average weight of a cord of manure, such as we\r\npay four dollars for.\r\n\r\nI had a cord of horse-stable manure from a livery stable in York which\r\nhad been all the time under cover, with several pigs running upon it,\r\nand was moist, without any excess of wet, loaded into a wagon-box\r\nholding an entire cord, or 128 cubic feet, tramped by the wagoner three\r\ntimes while loading.\r\n\r\nThe wagon was weighed at our hay-scales before loading, and then the\r\nwagon and load together, with a net result for the manure of 4,400 lbs.\r\nI considered this manure rather better than the average. I had another\r\nload, from a different place, which weighed over 5,000 lbs., but on\r\nexamination it was found to contain a good deal of coal ashes. We never\r\n_buy_ by the ton. Harrison Bros. & Co., Manufacturing Chemists,\r\nPhiladelphia, rate barnyard-manure as worth $5.77 per ton, and say that\r\nwould be about $7.21 per cord, which would be less than 1½ tons to the\r\ncord. If thrown in loosely, and it happened to be _very dry_, that might\r\nbe possible.\r\n\r\nWaring, in his “Handy Book of Husbandry,” page 201, says, he caused a\r\ncord of well-trodden livery stable manure containing the usual\r\nproportion of straw, to be carefully weighed, and that the cord weighed\r\n7,080 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe load I had weighed, weighing 4,400 lbs., was considered by the\r\nwagoner and by myself as a fair sample of good manure. In view of these\r\nwide differences, further trials would be desirable. Dana, in his “Muck\r\nManual,” says a cord of green cow-dung, pure, as dropped, weighs 9,289\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\nFarmers here seldom draw manure with less than three, more generally\r\nwith four horses or mules; loading is done by the purchaser. From the\r\nbarn-yard, put on loose boards, from 40 to 60 bushels are about an\r\naverage load.\r\n\r\nIn hauling from town to a distance of three to five miles, farmers\r\ngenerally make two loads of a cord each, a day’s work. From the\r\nbarn-yard, a very variable number, per day. In my own case, two men with\r\nthree horses have been hauling six and seven loads of sixty bushels,\r\nfine compost, a distance of from one-half to three-fourths of a mile, up\r\na long and rather steep hill, and spreading from the wagon, as hauled,\r\nupon grass-sod.\r\n\r\nOur larger farmers often have one driver and his team, two wagons, one\r\nloading, while the other is drawn to the field; the driver slips off one\r\nof the side-boards, and with his dung-hook draws off piles at nearly\r\nequal distances, to be spread as convenient.\r\n\r\n    EDWARD JESSOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Dr. E. L. Sturtevant, South Framingham, Mass.\r\n\r\n    SOUTH FRAMINGHAM, MASS., April 2, 1876.\r\n\r\nFRIEND HARRIS--Manure about Boston is sold in various ways. First,\r\naccording to the number of animals kept; price varying so much, that I\r\ndo not venture to name the figures. By the cord, to be trodden over\r\nwhile loading; never by weight, so far as I can learn--price from 0 to\r\n$12.00 per cord, according to season, and various accidental\r\ncircumstances. During the past winter, manure has been given away in\r\nBoston. Handling, hauling to the railroad, and freight costing $4 per\r\ncord for carrying 30 miles out. Market-gardeners usually haul manure as\r\na return freight on their journeys to and from market. About South\r\nFramingham, price stiff at $8 a cord in the cellar, and this may be\r\nconsidered the ruling suburban price. Very friendly yours,\r\n\r\n    E. LEWIS STURTEVANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from M. C. Weld.\r\n\r\n    NEW YORK, Nov. 9, 1876.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HARRIS--I don’t know what I can write about manures, that would\r\nbe of use. I have strong faith in humus, in ashes, leached and\r\nunleached, in lime, gas-lime, plaster, bones, ammonia ready formed,\r\nnitrates ready formed, not much in meat and blood, unless they are\r\n_cheap_. Nevertheless, they often are cheap, and produce splendid\r\neffects. I believe in sulphuric acid, with organic nitrogenous manures;\r\nthe composting of meat, blood, hair, etc., with peat and muck, and\r\nwetting it down with dilute sulphuric acid. I believe in green-manuring,\r\nheartily, and in tillage, tillage, tillage. Little faith in\r\nsuperphosphates and compounded manures, at selling prices. Habirshaw’s\r\nguano is good enough. So much for my creed. Truly yours,\r\n\r\n    M. C. WELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Peter Henderson.\r\n\r\n    NEW YORK, Oct. 26, 1876.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Joseph Harris_:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--If you will refer to my work “Gardening for Profit,” New\r\nEdition, page 34, you will get about all the information I possess on\r\nManures, except that I do not say anything about price. In a general way\r\nit might be safe to advise that whenever _a ton_ (it is always best to\r\nspeak of manures by weight) of either cow, horse, hog, or other\r\nstable-manure can be laid on the ground for $3, it is cheaper than\r\ncommercial fertilizers of any kind at their usual market rates. This $3\r\nper ton, I think, would be about the average cost in New York, Boston,\r\nor Philadelphia. We never haul it on the ground until we are ready to\r\nplow it in. If it has to be taken from the hog or cattle yards, we draw\r\nit out into large heaps, convenient to where it is to be put on the\r\nland, turning it, to keep it from burning or “fire-fanging,” if\r\nnecessary. None of our farmers or market-gardeners here keep it under\r\ncover. The expense of such covering and the greater difficulties in\r\ngetting at it, for the immense quantities we use, would be greater than\r\nthe benefits to be derived from keeping it under cover--benefits, in\r\nfact, which, I think, may be greatly overrated. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n    PETER HENDERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from J. M. B. Anderson, Ed. “Canada Farmer,” Toronto.\r\n\r\n    “CANADA FARMER” OFFICE, TORONTO, March 29, 1876.\r\n\r\n_J. Harris, Esq._:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--Yours of the 25th inst. is to hand, and I shall be most happy\r\nto render you any assistance in my power. The work you undertake is in\r\nable hands, and I have every confidence that, when completed, it will\r\nform an invaluable acquisition to the agricultural literature of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nManure in this city is usually sold by the two-horse load--about 1½\r\ntons--at the rate of $1 per load, or 66 cents per ton. The load contains\r\njust about a cord of manure, consequently a cord will weigh about 1½\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the general management of manure in Canada, I may say\r\nthat the system followed differs in no material respect from that of New\r\nYork and the other Eastern States. It is usually kept over winter in the\r\nopen barn yard (rarely under cover, I am sorry to say), laid out on the\r\nland about the time of disappearance of last snow, and plowed in. In\r\nsome cases it is not carted out until the land is ready for immediate\r\nplowing. With some of our more advanced farmers, the system has lately\r\nbeen adopted of keeping manure under cover and sprinkling it thoroughly\r\nat intervals with plaster and other substances. Tanks are also becoming\r\nmore common than formerly, for the preservation of liquid manure, which\r\nis usually applied by means of large, perforated hogs-heads, after the\r\nmanner of street-watering.\r\n\r\nYou ask, how the manure is managed at Bow Park, Brantford. That made\r\nduring fall and winter is carefully kept in as small bulk as possible,\r\nto prevent exposure to the weather. In February and March it is drawn\r\nout and put in heaps 8 feet square, and well packed, to prevent the\r\nescape of ammonia. In spring, as soon as practicable, it is spread, and\r\nplowed under immediately. Manure made in spring and summer is spread on\r\nthe field at once, and plowed under with a good, deep furrow.\r\n\r\n  Very truly yours, J. M. B. ANDERSON, Ed. _Canada Farmer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURE STATISTICS OF LONG ISLAND.\r\n\r\nThe Manure Trade of Long Island--Letter from J. H. Rushmore.\r\n\r\n    OLD WESTBURY, Long Island, April 6, 1876.\r\n\r\n_Joseph Harris, Esq._:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--The great number of dealers in manure in New York precludes\r\naccuracy, yet Mr. Skidmore (who has been testifying voluminously before\r\nthe New York Board of Health in relation to manure and street dirt),\r\nassures me that the accompanying figures are nearly correct. I enclose\r\nstatement, from two roads, taken from their books, and the amount\r\nshipped over the other road I obtained verbally from the General Freight\r\nAgent, and embody it in the sheet of statistics.\r\n\r\nThe Ash report I _know_ is correct, as I had access to the books showing\r\nthe business, for over ten years. I have made numerous applications,\r\nverbally, and by letter, to our largest market gardeners, but there\r\nseems to exist a general and strong disinclination to communicate\r\nanything worth knowing. I enclose the best of the replies received.\r\nSpeaking for some of our largest gardeners, I may say that they\r\ncultivate over one hundred acres, and use land sufficiently near to the\r\ncity to enable them to dispense with railroad transportation in bringing\r\nmanure to their places and marketing crops. I have noticed that one of\r\nthe shrewdest gardeners invariably composts horn-shavings and bone-meal\r\nwith horse-manure several months before expecting to use it. A safe\r\naverage of manure used per acre by gardeners, may be stated at ninety\r\n(90) tubs, and from two hundred to twenty hundred pounds of fertilizer\r\nin addition, according to its strength, and the kind of crop.\r\n\r\nThe following railroad manure statistics will give a generally correct\r\nidea of the age of manure, when used:\r\n\r\n  Statement of Manure Sent from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 1875.\r\n\r\n              _Over F.N.S.&C.R.R._  _Over Southern R.R._\r\n  January         1,531  tubs.         5,815 tubs.\r\n  February                             4,357  ”\r\n  March             740   ”           12,217  ”\r\n  April          12,122   ”            7,055  ”\r\n  May             7,383   ”            3,049  ”\r\n  June            5,725   ”            1,365  ”\r\n  July            6,473½  ”              685  ”\r\n  August          6,370½  ”            2,911  ”\r\n  September       3,197   ”           14,702  ”\r\n  October           880   ”              660  ”\r\n  November          512   ”              840  ”\r\n  December        1,406   ”            4,923  ”\r\n                 --------------         ------------\r\n                 46,340  tubs.        57,679 tubs.\r\n\r\nA tub is equal to 14 bushels.\r\n\r\nHobson, Hurtado & Co. report the amount of Peruvian guano sold in this\r\ncountry last year at thirty thousand tons.\r\n\r\nEstimated number of horses in New York city, 100,000.\r\n\r\nEstimated product of manure per horse.

Most market gardeners keep so\r\nlittle stock that the manure made on the place is very inconsiderable.\r\nOur dairy farmers either compost home-made manures with that from the\r\ncity, spread it on the land for corn in the spring, or rot it separate,\r\nto use in the fall for wheat, on land that has been cropped with oats\r\nthe same year. The manure put on for potatoes is generally estimated to\r\nenrich the land sufficient for it to produce one crop of winter grain,\r\nand from five to seven crops of grass, when it is again plowed and\r\ncultivated in rotation with, first, corn, second, potatoes or oats, and\r\nis reseeded in autumn of the same year.\r\n\r\nFish and fish guano are largely used on land bordering the water, and\r\nadjacent to the oil-works. The average price for guano in bulk at\r\noil-works is $12 per ton. The average price for fish on wharf is $1.50\r\nper thousand, and it is estimated that, as a general average, 6,000 fish\r\nmake a ton of guano. The fish, when applied to corn, are placed two at\r\neach hill, and plowed under at any time after the corn is large enough\r\nto cultivate. Seaweed is highly prized by all who use it, and it will\r\nproduce a good crop of corn when spread thickly on the land previous to\r\nplowing.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\n    J. H. RUSHMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from John E. Backus.\r\n\r\n    NEWTOWN, Long Island, N.Y., March 2nd, 1876.\r\n\r\n_Mr. G. H. Rushmore_:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR.--Some farmers and market-gardeners use more, and some less,\r\nmanure, according to crops to be raised. I use about 30 good two-horse\r\nwagon-loads to the acre, to be applied in rows or broad-casted, as best\r\nfor certain crops. I prefer old horse-dung for most all purposes. Guano,\r\nas a fertilizer, phosphate of bone and blood are very good; they act as\r\na stimulant on plants and vegetation, and are highly beneficial to some\r\nvegetation--more valuable on poor soil than elsewhere, except to produce\r\na thrifty growth in plants, and to insure a large crop.\r\n\r\nBy giving you these few items they vary considerably on different parts\r\nof the Island; judgment must be used in all cases and all business.\r\nHoping these few lines may be of some avail to Mr. Harris and yourself,\r\n\r\n  I remain, yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n    JOHN E. BACKUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURE IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nLetter from Joseph Heacock.\r\n\r\n    JENKINTOWN, Montgomery Co., Pa., April 18th, 1876.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND HARRIS.--Stable-manure in Philadelphia, costs by the\r\nsingle four-horse-load, about $9 or $10. Mostly, the farmers who haul\r\nmuch of it, have it engaged by the year, and then it can be had for from\r\n$7 to $8 per load. Mostly, four horses are used, though we frequently\r\nsee two and three-horse teams, and occasionally, five or six horses are\r\nused. I have never seen any kind of dung hauled but that of horses.\r\nCow-manure would be thought too heavy to haul so long a distance.\r\nSugar-house waste, spent hops, glue waste, etc, are hauled to a small\r\nextent. We live about 9 miles from the center of the city, and the road\r\nis very hilly, though otherwise a good one, being made of stone.\r\n\r\nThe loads vary from 2½ to 3½ or 4 tons for four horses, according to the\r\ndryness of the manure. The wagons are made very strong, and weigh from\r\n1,600 lbs. to 2,300 or 2,400 lbs., according to the number of horses\r\nthat are to be used to them. I cannot say how many cords there are in an\r\naverage load, but probably not less than two cords to four horses. One\r\nof my neighbors has a stable engaged by the year. He pays $2.50 per ton,\r\nand averages about three tons per load, and the distance from the stable\r\nin the city to his place, can not be less than 12 miles. His team goes\r\nempty one way and of course can not haul more than a load a day. In\r\nfact, can not average that, as it would be too hard on his horses. The\r\nhorses used for the purpose are large and strong. Fifteen or twenty\r\nyears ago, there was kept on most farms of 75 to 100 acres, a team\r\npurposely for hauling manure from the city. But it is different now,\r\nmany of the farmers using artificial manures, as it costs so much less;\r\nand others are keeping more stock, and so making their own manure.\r\nStill, there is a great deal hauled yet. And some of it to a distance of\r\n20 miles. Though when hauled to this distance, the teams are loaded both\r\nways. For instance, they will start to the city with a load of hay (35\r\nto 50 cwt.), on Monday afternoon (Tuesday is the day of the Hay Market);\r\nand when they have their load of hay off on Tuesday, they load their\r\nmanure and drive out five or six miles and put up for the night. Next\r\nmorning they start about 3 o’clock, arriving home before noon, having\r\nbeen away two days. On Thursday afternoon, they start again. You can see\r\nthat manuring in this way is very expensive. But farmers about here well\r\nknow that if they do not manure well they raise but little. Probably\r\nabout four loads are used per acre on the average. Each load is\r\ngenerally thrown off the wagon in one large heap near where wanted, and\r\nis allowed to lie until they use it. I can not tell how much it loses in\r\nbulk by lying in the heap.\r\n\r\nAs to what crops it is used on, farmers do not think that they could go\r\namiss in applying it to anything except oats. But it is probably used\r\nmore for top-dressing mowing land, and for potatoes, than for anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThe usual rotation is corn, potatoes, or oats, wheat seeded to clover\r\nand timothy, and then kept in grass from two to four years. Those who\r\nhaul stable-manure, usually use bone-dust or superphosphate to a greater\r\nor less extent.\r\n\r\nLast December I built a pig-pen, 20 ft. × 40 ft., 1½ stories high. The\r\nupper story to be used for litter, etc. There is a four feet entry on\r\nthe north side, running the length of the building. The remainder is\r\ndivided into five pens, each 8 ft. × 16 ft. It is made so that in cold\r\nweather it can be closed up tight, while in warmer weather it can be\r\nmade as open as an out-shed. I am very much pleased with it. The pigs\r\nmake a great deal of manure, and I believe that it can be made much\r\ncheaper than it can be bought and hauled from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n    JOSEPH HEACOCK, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Herman L. Routzahn.\r\n\r\n    MIDDLETOWN, Md., May 11th, 1876.\r\n\r\n_Joseph Harris, Esq._:\r\n\r\nI herewith proceed to answer questions asked.\r\n\r\nWheat and corn are principal crops. Corn is fed now altogether to stock\r\nfor the manure.\r\n\r\nThere is but little soiling done. The principal method of making manure\r\nis: Feeding all the corn raised, as well as hay, oats, and roots, to\r\ncattle; using wheat straw, weeds, etc., as bedding, throwing the manure\r\nin the yard (uncovered), and to cover the pile with plaster (by sowing\r\nbroadcast), at least once a week. To this pile is added the manure from\r\nthe hog-pens, hen-house, etc., and worked over thoroughly at least twice\r\nbefore using. It is then applied to corn by plowing _under_; to wheat,\r\nas a top-dressing. For corn it is usually hauled to the field, thrown\r\noff in heaps 25 feet each way, a cart-load making two heaps. Spread just\r\nbefore the plow. For wheat, spread on directly after plowing, and\r\nthoroughly harrowed in. Applied broadcast for potatoes. Composts of\r\ndifferent kinds are made and used same as in other localities,\r\nI presume. Artificial manures are going into disrepute (justly too).\r\nThis is the plan now adopted by the farmers in this county (Frederick).\r\nWhere woods are accessible, leaves and mould are hauled in and added to\r\nthe manure-heap; in fact, every substance that can be worked into the\r\nmanure-heap is freely used. Well-rotted stable-manure is worth from\r\n$1.50 to $2.50 per cord, according to condition and locality.\r\n\r\n  Very Respectfully Yours,\r\n\r\n    HERMAN L. ROUTZAHN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Prof. E. M. Shelton, Prof. of Agriculture, Kansas State\r\nAgricultural College.\r\n\r\n  KANSAS STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE,\r\n\r\n    MANHATTAN, Kansas, May 5, 1876.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR.--In reply to your first question, I would say that\r\nstable-manure in this vicinity, is held in very light estimation.\r\nIndeed, by the householders of this city, and quite generally by the\r\nfarmers, manure is regarded as one of those things--like drouth and\r\ngrasshoppers--with which a mysterious Providence sees fit to clog the\r\noperations of the husband-man. The great bulk of the stable-manure made\r\nin this city is, every spring, carted into ravines and vacant\r\nlots--wherever, in short, with least expense it can be put out of reach\r\nof the senses.\r\n\r\nIt must not be understood by this that manure has little influence on\r\nthe growing crops in Kansas. Nowhere have I seen such excellent results\r\nfrom application of home-made fertilizers, as in Kansas. For those\r\nsterile wastes known as “Alkali lands,” and “Buffalo wallows,” manure is\r\na speedy and certain cure. During two years of severe drouth, I have\r\nnoticed that wherever manure had been supplied, the crop withstood the\r\neffects of dry weather much better than where no application had been\r\nmade. Four years ago, a strip across one of our fields was heavily\r\nmanured; this year this field is into wheat, and a dark band that may be\r\nseen half a mile shows where this application was made.\r\n\r\nThese facts the better class of our farmers are beginning to appreciate.\r\nA few days ago, a neighbor, a very intelligent farmer, assured me that\r\nfrom manuring eight to ten acres every year, his farm was now in better\r\ncondition than when be broke up the prairie fifteen years ago.\r\n\r\nI know of no analysis of stable or farmyard-manure made in Kansas.\r\nConcerning the _weight_ of manures, I can give you a few facts, having\r\nhad occasion during the past winter to weigh several loads used for\r\nexperimental purposes. This manure was wheeled into the barnyard,\r\nchiefly from the cattle stalls, during the winter of 1874-5. It lay in\r\nthe open yard until February last, when it was weighed and hauled to the\r\nfields. I found that a wagon-box, 1½ × 3 × 9 feet, into which the manure\r\nwas pitched, without treading, held with slight variations, when level\r\nfull, one ton. At this rate a cord would weigh very close to three tons.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty that we have to encounter in the management of\r\nmanure grows out of our dry summers. During our summer months, unless\r\nsufficient moisture is obtained, the manure dries out rapidly, becomes\r\nfire-fanged and practically worthless. My practice upon the College farm\r\nhas been to give the bottom of the barn-yard a “dishing” form, so that\r\nit holds all the water that falls upon it. The manure I keep as flat as\r\npossible, taking pains to place it where the animals will keep it trod\r\ndown solid. I have adopted this plan after having tried composting and\r\npiling the manure in the yards, and am satisfied that it is the only\r\n_practical_ way to manage manures in this climate.\r\n\r\nThere is no particular crop to which manure is generally applied in this\r\nState, unless, perhaps, wheat. The practice of applying manure as a\r\ntop-dressing to winter-wheat, is rapidly gaining ground here. It is\r\nfound that the manure thus applied, acting as a mulch, mitigates the\r\neffects of drouth, besides improving the quality of the grain.\r\n\r\n  Very Respectfully Yours,\r\n\r\n   E. M. SHELTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Prof. W. H. Brewer, Professor of Agriculture in Sheffield\r\nScientific School of Yale College.\r\n\r\n  SHEFFIELD SCIENTIFIC SCHOOL OF YALE COLLEGE,\r\n\r\n    NEW HAVEN, Conn., April 14th, 1876.\r\n\r\n_Joseph Harris, Esq., Rochester, N.Y._:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR.--I have made inquiries relating to “the price of\r\nstable-manure in New Haven, and how far the farmers and gardeners haul\r\nit, etc.” I have not been to the horse-car stables, but I have to\r\nseveral _livery_ stables, and they are all essentially the same.\r\n\r\nThey say that but little is sold by the _cord_ or _ton_, or by any\r\nweight or measure. It is sold either “in the lump,” “by the month,” “by\r\nthe year,” or “per horse.” Some sell it at a given sum per month for all\r\ntheir horses, on a general estimate of their horses--thus, one man says,\r\n“I get, this year, $25 per month for all my manure, he to remove it as\r\nfast as it accumulates; say one, two, or three times per week. He hauls\r\nit about five miles and composts it all before using.”\r\n\r\nAnother says, he sells _per horse_. “I get, this year, $13 per horse,\r\nthey to haul it.” The price per horse ranges from $10 to $15 per year,\r\nthe latter sum being high.\r\n\r\nFrom the small or private stables, the manure is generally “lumped”\r\nby private contract, and is largely used about the city. It is hauled\r\nsometimes as much as 10 miles, but usually much less.\r\n\r\nBut the larger stables often sell per shipment--it is sent by cars up\r\nthe Connecticut Valley to Westfield, etc., where it is often hauled\r\nseveral miles from the railroad or river.\r\n\r\nMuch manure is sent by boat from New York to the Connecticut Valley\r\ntobacco lands. Boats (“barges”) are even loaded in Albany, go down the\r\nHudson, up the Sound to Connecticut, to various places near Hartford,\r\nI am told. Two or three years ago, a man came here and exhibited to us\r\npressed masses of manure--a patent had been taken out for pressing it,\r\nto send by R.R. (stable manure). I never heard anything more about\r\nit--and he was confident and enthusiastic about it.\r\n\r\n  Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    WM. H.

This book is intended alike for the student\r\n  and the farmer. The author has succeeded in giving in regular and\r\n  orderly sequence, and in language so simple that a child can\r\n  understand it, the principles that govern the science and practice of\r\n  feeding farm animals. Professor Shaw is certainly to be congratulated\r\n  on the successful manner in which he has accomplished a most difficult\r\n  task. His book is unquestionably the most practical work which has\r\n  appeared on the subject of feeding farm animals. Illustrated. 5½ × 8\r\n  inches. Upward of 500 pages. Cloth.    $2.00\r\n\r\n+Profitable Dairying+\r\n\r\n  By C. L. PECK. A practical guide to successful dairy management. The\r\n  treatment of the entire subject is thoroughly practical, being\r\n  principally a description of the methods practiced by the author.\r\n  A specially valuable part of this book consists of a minute\r\n  description of the far-famed model dairy farm of Rev. J. D. Detrich,\r\n  near Philadelphia, Pa. On the farm of fifteen acres, which twenty\r\n  years ago could not maintain one horse and two cows, there are now\r\n  kept twenty-seven dairy cattle, in addition to two horses. All the\r\n  roughage, litter, bedding, etc., necessary for these animals are grown\r\n  on these fifteen acres, more than most farmers could accomplish on one\r\n  hundred acres. Illustrated. 5 × 7 inches. 200 pages. Cloth.    $0.75\r\n\r\n+Practical Dairy Bacteriology+\r\n\r\n  By Dr. H. W. CONN, of Wesleyan University. A complete exposition of\r\n  important facts concerning the relation of bacteria to various\r\n  problems related to milk. A book for the classroom, laboratory,\r\n  factory and farm. Equally useful to the teacher, student, factory man\r\n  and practical dairyman. Fully illustrated with 83 original pictures.\r\n  340 pages. Cloth. 5½ × 8 inches.    $1.25\r\n\r\n+Modern Methods of Testing Milk and Milk Products+\r\n\r\n  By L. L. VanSLYKE. This is a clear and concise discussion of the\r\n  approved methods of testing milk and milk products. All the questions\r\n  involved in the various methods of testing milk and cream are handled\r\n  with rare skill and yet in so plain a manner that they can be fully\r\n  understood by all. The book should be in the hands of every dairyman,\r\n  teacher or student. Illustrated. 214 pages. 5 × 7 inches.    $0.75\r\n\r\n+Animal Breeding+\r\n\r\n  By THOMAS SHAW. This book is the most complete and comprehensive work\r\n  ever published on the subject of which it treats. It is the first book\r\n  which has systematized the subject of animal breeding. The leading\r\n  laws which govern this most intricate question the author has boldly\r\n  defined and authoritatively arranged. The chapters which he has\r\n  written on the more involved features of the subject, as sex and the\r\n  relative influence of parents, should go far toward setting at rest\r\n  the wildly speculative views cherished with reference to these\r\n  questions. The striking originality in the treatment of the subject is\r\n  no less conspicuous than the superb order and regular sequence of\r\n  thought from the beginning to the end of the book. The book is\r\n  intended to meet the needs of all persons interested in the breeding\r\n  and rearing of live stock. Illustrated. 405 pages. 5 × 7 inches.\r\n  Cloth.    $1.50\r\n\r\n+Forage Crops Other Than Grasses+\r\n\r\n  By THOMAS SHAW. How to cultivate, harvest and use them. Indian corn,\r\n  sorghum, clover, leguminous plants, crops of the brassica genus, the\r\n  cereals, millet, field roots, etc. Intensely practical and reliable.\r\n  Illustrated. 287 pages. 5 × 7 inches. Cloth.    $1.00\r\n\r\n+Soiling Crops and the Silo+\r\n\r\n  By THOMAS SHAW. The growing and feeding of all kinds of soiling crops,\r\n  conditions to which they are adapted, their plan in the rotation, etc.\r\n  Not a line is repeated from the Forage Crops book. Best methods of\r\n  building the silo, filling it and feeding ensilage. Illustrated. 364\r\n  pages. 5 × 7 inches. Cloth.    $1.50\r\n\r\n+The Study of Breeds+\r\n\r\n  By THOMAS SHAW. Origin, history, distribution, characteristics,\r\n  adaptability, uses, and standards of excellence of all pedigreed\r\n  breeds of cattle, sheep and swine in America. The accepted text book\r\n  in colleges, and the authority for farmers and breeders. Illustrated.\r\n  371 pages. 5 × 7 inches. Cloth.    $1.50\r\n\r\n+Clovers and How to Grow Them+\r\n\r\n  By THOMAS SHAW. This is the first book published which treats on the\r\n  growth, cultivation and treatment of clovers as applicable to all\r\n  parts of the United States and Canada, and which takes up the entire\r\n  subject in a systematic way and consecutive sequence. The importance\r\n  of clover in the economy of the farm is so great that an exhaustive\r\n  work on this subject will no doubt be welcomed by students in\r\n  agriculture, as well as by all who are interested in the tilling of\r\n  the soil. Illustrated. 5 × 7 inches. 337 pages. Cloth. Net.    $1.00\r\n\r\n+Land Draining+\r\n\r\n  A handbook for farmers on the principles and practice of draining, by\r\n  MANLY MILES, giving the results of his extended experience in laying\r\n  tile drains. The directions for the laying out and the construction of\r\n  tile drains will enable the farmer to avoid the errors of imperfect\r\n  construction, and the disappointment that must necessarily follow.\r\n  This manual for practical farmers will also be found convenient for\r\n  reference in regard to many questions that may arise in crop growing,\r\n  aside from the special subjects of drainage of which it treats.\r\n  Illustrated. 200 pages. 5 × 7 inches. Cloth.    $1.00\r\n\r\n+Barn Plans and Outbuildings+\r\n\r\n  Two hundred and fifty-seven illustrations. A most valuable work, full\r\n  of ideas, hints, suggestions, plans, etc., for the construction of\r\n  barns and outbuildings, by practical writers. Chapters are devoted to\r\n  the economic erection and use of barns, grain barns, horse barns,\r\n  cattle barns, sheep barns, cornhouses, smokehouses, icehouses, pig\r\n  pens, granaries, etc. There are likewise chapters on birdhouses,\r\n  doghouses, tool sheds, ventilators, roofs and roofing, doors and\r\n  fastenings, workshops, poultry houses, manure sheds, barnyards, root\r\n  pits, etc. 235 pages. 5 × 7 inches.

A treatise on the care of woodlands and\r\n  the restoration of the denuded timberlands on plains and mountains.\r\n  The author has fully described those European methods which have\r\n  proved to be most useful in maintaining the superb forests of the old\r\n  world. This experience has been adapted to the different climates and\r\n  trees of America, full instructions being given for forest planting of\r\n  our various kinds of soil and subsoil, whether on mountain or valley.\r\n  Illustrated. 250 pages. 5 × 7 inches.
