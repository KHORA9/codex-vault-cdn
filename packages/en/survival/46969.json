The tailings piles left\r\nby gold dredges have been levelled for building sites since the\r\nphotograph was taken in 1946.]\r\n\r\nOne of the Pacific Northwest’s most notable outdoor recreation areas,\r\nthe “John Day Country” in northeastern Oregon, is named after a native\r\nVirginian who was a member of the Astor expedition to the mouth of the\r\nColumbia River in 1812.\r\n\r\nThere is little factual information about John Day except that he was\r\nborn in Culpeper County, Va. about 1770. It is known also that in 1810\r\nthis tall pioneer “with an elastic step as if he trod on springs” joined\r\nJohn Jacob Astor’s overland expedition under Wilson Price Hunt to\r\nestablish a vast fur-gathering network in the western states based on a\r\nmajor trading post at the mouth of the Columbia River.\r\n\r\nThe expedition arrived in the vicinity of the Grand Tetons, in what is\r\nnow Wyoming, in September 1811, and with the onset of winter met\r\ndisaster along the Snake River. When they ran out of food near the\r\npresent site of Twin Falls, Idaho, Hunt divided the expedition into four\r\nparties to seek food and a feasible route through the canyons. As\r\ndescribed in Washington Irving’s _Astoria_, the party that included John\r\nDay became widely separated from the others; experienced terrible\r\nhardships while wintering with Indians near Huntington; and was\r\neventually reduced to just John Day and Ramsey Crooks. By mid-April of\r\nthe following year, Day and Crooks reached the junction of the Columbia\r\nand Mah-hah Rivers, where a band of Indians took everything they had,\r\nincluding their clothes. Because of this incident, the Mah-hah River was\r\nrenamed the John Day. Returning up the Columbia to seek help from\r\nfriendly Indians, they were rescued by a party of trappers in canoes,\r\nand finally reached Astoria on the 11th of May 1812.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first discovery of gold in Oregon reportedly was made in\r\n1845 on one of the upper branches of the John Day River by a member of\r\nan immigrant train, the settlement of the John Day Country really began\r\nin 1862, when gold was discovered in Canyon Creek just above Canyon\r\nCity. Since then, possibly $30,000,000 worth of gold has been mined,\r\nmostly from gravels in and along Canyon Creek and along a 10-mile\r\nstretch of the John Day River. Lumbering and ranching are now the\r\nprincipal industries of the region.\r\n\r\nThe growth of tourism in Oregon and Grant County and the accompanying\r\nincrease of interest in geology have stimulated the preparation of this\r\nleaflet. The Grant County Planning Commission and State Department of\r\nGeology and Mineral Industries have cooperated most cordially in the\r\nprogram to better inform interested visitors about the geology of the\r\ncountry they are seeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _GEOLOGIC HISTORY_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Day Country of today covers an area of 4,000-5,000 square miles\r\nin the southwestern part of the Blue Mountain region of Oregon, and is\r\nin the borderland between two major geologic provinces. One, to the\r\nnorth, is the Columbia Plateau which consists of flat or gently tilted\r\nflows of basalt covering about 100,000 square miles. The other, to the\r\nsouth, is the Basin and Range Province which extends into Mexico, and is\r\ncharacterized by a wide variety of complexly folded and faulted rocks.\r\nThe Strawberry-Aldrich Mountain Range, rising from 7,000 to 9,000 feet\r\nin altitude along the south side of the John Day River valley (see\r\nFigure 13 on page 21), is part of a 150-mile long, east-trending\r\nmountain chain that locally separates the two provinces.\r\n\r\nMany features that record events in the geologic history of northeastern\r\nOregon may be seen in the rocks along the paved highways within the John\r\nDay Country. A road log describing some of these features is included as\r\na part of this booklet. The locations of principal points of interest,\r\nkeyed in the road log to state highway mile posts, are shown on the map\r\naccompanying the road log.\r\n\r\nThe known part of the geologic history of the John Day Country began\r\nwith lava flows and deposition of volcanic ash, sandstone, shale, and\r\nsmall lenses of limestone in a late Paleozoic sea more than 250 million\r\nyears ago. Sometime between 200 and 250 million years ago, peridotite\r\nand gabbro (dark, magnesium-rich varieties of igneous rock) rose from\r\ngreat depths and, as molten material (_magma_), invaded the preexisting\r\nmarine deposits. These igneous rocks now form the core of Canyon\r\nMountain and can be seen along the precipitous walls of Canyon Creek.\r\nMasses of chromium ore (_chromite_) were carried upward with the molten\r\nmaterial. After erosion had exposed the peridotite and gabbro, the area\r\nwas submerged again and, during Late Triassic and Early Jurassic time\r\n(about 180 million years ago), the Aldrich Mountain area was part of a\r\nseaway into which lavas flowed. Thousands of feet of volcanic ash from\r\nactive volcanoes accumulated in the sea, and between eruptions great\r\nthicknesses of mudstone and shale were deposited. The cuts along U. S.\r\nHighway 395 between Canyon Creek and Bear Valley are in these rocks.\r\nDuring part of this volcanic activity, Canyon Mountain stood as a high\r\nlandmass, but finally it too was deeply buried. Again the region emerged\r\nand probably was dry land during the last half of Jurassic time (135 to\r\n150 million years ago).\r\n\r\nIn Early Cretaceous time, molten material was intruded to form the\r\ngranitic rocks in the Aldrich Mountains and near Dixie Butte, northeast\r\nof Prairie City. The gold veins in Canyon Mountain and in most of the\r\nBlue Mountain region probably were formed at that time by solutions from\r\nthe granitic magma. Scattered patches of fossiliferous sandstone and\r\nconglomerate like that in Goose Rock (see Figure 5 on page 10) show that\r\nthe sea encroached on the Blue Mountain region briefly during Cretaceous\r\ntime after erosion had exposed the granites. The shoreline was not far\r\neast of the John Day area.\r\n\r\nFor the past 60 million years, eastern Oregon has been a land of\r\nvolcanoes, mountain building, and erosion. After the retreat of the\r\nCretaceous sea and an undefined period of erosion, volcanic eruptions\r\nfrom widely scattered centers during the Eocene Epoch buried the region\r\nunder several thousand feet of volcanic rocks which now form the Clarno\r\nFormation; locally these rocks consist mostly of andesitic lava flows\r\nand coarse mud-flow breccias. The Clarno Formation was extensively\r\nfolded and faulted and deeply eroded before another series of volcanoes\r\nin and somewhat east of the Cascade Mountains erupted rhyolitic ash that\r\nwas blown eastward and deposited as the John Day Formation during the\r\nOligocene Epoch. The John Day Formation appears to have been restricted\r\nto a lowland area which geologists today call the John Day basin,\r\nlocated between the present site of the Cascade Mountains and the\r\nancestral Blue Mountains. The Clarno and John Day beds in this basin are\r\nworld famous, having yielded thousands of bones, leaves, and pieces of\r\npetrified wood that were buried and preserved by the volcanic ash in a\r\nmanner similar to the burial of Pompeii by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius\r\nin 79 A. D. Archaic large mammals such as the titanotheres, and small\r\nancestors of modern mammals such as the 4-toed forest horse _Eohippus_,\r\nwhich was the size of a fox terrier, roamed subtropical forests during\r\nthe Eocene Epoch. Many important links in the evolutionary chain of\r\nmammals have been found in the John Day fossil beds; for example, the\r\n3-toed horse _Mesohippus_, which was a forest dweller the size of a\r\nsheep, had teeth for browsing instead of grazing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modern day landscape began to take form in Middle Miocene time, when\r\nthe basalt flows which cover most of the area and are exposed in the\r\nwalls of Picture Gorge (hence their name, Picture Gorge Basalt) buried\r\nthe landscape formed on the John Day Formation and older rocks. The\r\nbasalt erupted from long cracks or fissures in the Earth’s crust and\r\nformed floods of very fluid lava which flowed for distances up to one\r\nhundred miles. These basalts are recognized by geologists to be of a\r\ndistinct type, commonly called plateau or flood basalt. Basalt, frozen\r\nin the fissures, forms dikes that commonly weather out above the\r\nadjoining softer rocks, as shown in the picture of Kimberly Dike on page\r\n16.\r\n\r\nWhile the Picture Gorge Basalt was flooding most of the John Day basin,\r\nseveral volcanoes in the vicinity of Strawberry Mountain erupted\r\nandesitic to rhyolitic lava and ash, and built up cones similar to Mt.\r\nHood and the other high peaks of the Oregon Cascades. Geologists have\r\nnamed the remnants of these cones the Strawberry Volcanics. Because\r\nthese volcanoes rose several thousand feet above the top of the Picture\r\nGorge Basalt, ash and erosional debris from them washed out over the\r\nbasalt; these materials constitute the Mascall Formation. Although the\r\nmountains were timbered, the lowlands probably were open and grassy.\r\nBones and teeth of a pony-size three-toed horse, _Merychippus_, have\r\nbeen dug from the Mascall Formation. When the eruptions ceased in Early\r\nPliocene time (about 10 million years ago), the entire Blue Mountain\r\nregion probably resembled the eastern part of the Cascade Mountains in\r\nOregon today, particularly the area between Mt. Hood and Crater Lake.\r\n\r\nThe present Strawberry-Aldrich Mountain range and the ridges and valleys\r\nnorth of it were formed when the Earth’s crust buckled and broke under\r\nstrong compressive forces from the north and south. Partly by bending or\r\nfolding, and partly by breaking along the John Day and other faults, the\r\nStrawberry-Aldrich Mountains were gradually raised a mile and a half to\r\ntwo miles above the valley to the north. The floor of the main John Day\r\nRiver valley was filled with gravels eroded from the rising mountains\r\nand, as the folding and faulting and erosion slowed, an extensive,\r\nbroad, gently sloping surface was formed on top of the valley fill.\r\nWhile these gravels (called the Rattlesnake Formation) were\r\naccumulating, however, a great volcanic eruption spread an ash flow more\r\nthan 100 feet thick over the entire length of the John Day valley floor;\r\nremnants of this flow form prominent rim-rocks between the town of John\r\nDay and Picture Gorge. Bones of _Hipparion_, a horse the size of a pony\r\nwhich had feet and teeth like modern horses, have been found in the\r\ngravels under the ash flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _THE PRESENT LANDSCAPE_\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferences in the rates of erosion of various rocks were as important\r\nas folding and faulting in forming the topographic features in the John\r\nDay Country. The chief agents of erosion are chemical weathering\r\nprocesses that eventually break down or decompose all rocks, and running\r\nwater which carries away the weathered or partly weathered and broken\r\nmaterial. Picture Gorge is narrow because the basalts in the walls are\r\nvery resistant to weathering and break along vertical joints into large\r\nblocks that do not move easily. In contrast, the John Day River has cut\r\na broad, flat-floored valley in the Mascall Formation at the south end\r\nof Picture Gorge because the ashy beds weather to fine clay which is\r\neasily washed away.\r\n\r\nLandslides have marked the face of the John Day Country. Large rock\r\nmasses commonly slide where steep cliffs form in soft rocks that are\r\ncapped by hard resistant rocks. When the cliff face becomes too high and\r\nsteep, the soft beds give way and large blocks or masses slide downward,\r\nusually tilting backward as they move, as shown in the diagram of\r\nCathedral Rock on page 15. Cathedral Rock and two small landslides north\r\nof the river, about two miles east of John Day, show this classic form.\r\nMany landslides, however, are just jumbled, hummocky masses of slumped\r\nmaterial. Large-scale landsliding in the John Day Formation under the\r\nPicture Gorge Basalt is colorfully displayed along the river for 8 miles\r\nnorth of Picture Gorge. Some landslides occur suddenly, but many move\r\nforward only as fast as the toe or lower end is eroded away, as at\r\nSunken Mountain.\r\n\r\nGlaciers have sculptured the principal valleys that lie above an\r\naltitude of about 5,000 feet. Moving ice, hundreds of feet thick,\r\nplucked out semi-circular amphitheaters called _cirques_ at the heads of\r\nthe valleys. The 2,000-foot cliffs above Little Strawberry Lake were\r\nformed this way. Rocks held in the ice, like the teeth of a giant rasp,\r\nground off irregularities and widened the valley bottoms to a broad U\r\nshape as the glaciers moved down the valleys. The effectiveness of ice\r\nscour can be seen by comparing glaciated Strawberry Creek above\r\nStrawberry Lake (as shown in figure 15 on page 22) with unglaciated\r\nPicture Gorge or with Canyon Creek just above Canyon City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ROAD LOG OF THE JOHN DAY “LOOP”\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: Mileages at lettered stops on the map (Fig. 1) refer to nearby\r\nmile posts. These are not in numerical order because the route covers\r\nparts of four different numbered highways. By taking the tour clockwise,\r\nthe traveler will be at higher altitudes later in the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                A. 155.4\r\n\r\n_Holliday Rest Area._ The main John Day fault, which here is buried\r\nunder river gravel, is believed to be just south of the rest area. A\r\nparallel step fault (Fig. 2) cuts from left to right across the southern\r\nslope of Mt. Vernon Butte about where the juniper trees thin out. Flows\r\nof Picture Gorge Basalt in the upper part of the butte slope down to\r\nvalley level on your left. Rocks in the foreground and to the right are\r\nrudely bedded volcanic breccias of the Clarno Formation. The Clarno\r\nFormation has been raised as much as 250 feet by movement along the\r\nfault to position it against the basalt as indicated in the diagram. The\r\nfault can be seen best in afternoon light in the ravine to the right,\r\njust south of some brick-red layers in the basalt.\r\n\r\nMovement on the main John Day fault to the south appears to have raised\r\nthe rocks at least 1,000 feet, so the two faults have stairstepped the\r\nrock layers. The main John Day fault has been traced about 80 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—View of Mount Vernon Butte and diagram of\r\nfaulting along its south slope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—View of the John Day fault in Mascall Formation\r\nat the mouth of Fields Creek, and its relation to the structure of the\r\nJohn Day River valley.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                B. 144.0\r\n\r\n_Fields Creek Road._ In the road cuts just south of the highway, the\r\nJohn Day fault (Fig. 3) passes through the Mascall Formation where the\r\nslope or dip of the beds changes abruptly from gently southward to\r\nsteeply northward. The fault continues westward under the floor of the\r\nvalley. Fossil leaves and snails can be found in the beds south of the\r\nfault, and 1,000 feet farther south vertical Picture Gorge Basalt flows\r\nare exposed.\r\n\r\nTo the north across the valley at the White Hills, beds of the Mascall\r\nFormation have been dropped down against the Picture Gorge Basalt along\r\nthe Belshaw fault. The White Hills are a well-known locality for\r\ncollecting fossil leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           C. 138.5 to 135.0\r\n\r\n_Vertical Ribs._ The prominent vertical ribs, visible south of the river\r\nin steep slopes below the high bench (pediment), are flows of Picture\r\nGorge Basalt tilted vertically in the north limb of the Aldrich Mountain\r\nanticline. The John Day fault follows the base of the steep front in\r\nwhich the ribs are exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                D. 132.6\r\n\r\n_Volcanic Ash Flow._ The rimrock north of the John Day River between\r\nhere and Dayville is a volcanic ash flow that erupted about five million\r\nyears ago as red hot pumice highly charged with gas. A rapidly moving\r\nincandescent cloud probably filled the ancient John Day River valley and\r\ndeposited ash to a depth of more than 100 feet over a distance of 60 to\r\n70 miles. As shown in Figure 4, the ash flow blankets about 200 feet of\r\ngravels that had been deposited in the valley. The rimrock and the\r\ngravels above and below it constitute the Rattlesnake Formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.—View northwest across the John Day River valley\r\ntoward Picture Gorge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                E. 126.0\r\n\r\n_Picture Gorge._ Visible to the left of Picture Gorge, from north around\r\nto west, in order of their deposition and geologic age from oldest to\r\nyoungest, are the Picture Gorge Basalt, Mascall Formation, and\r\nRattlesnake Formation (Fig. 5). The Picture Gorge Basalt flows and ashy\r\nbeds of the Mascall Formation were tilted southward together and eroded\r\nbefore the Rattlesnake Formation was laid down horizontally across them.\r\nPicture Gorge and the present valley were then cut by the John Day River\r\nafter the Rattlesnake Formation had been tilted in its turn. The five\r\nbenches or terraces on the basalt just east of Picture Gorge mark\r\ntemporary halts in downcutting of the John Day River.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                F. 122.0\r\n\r\n_Thomas Condon Viewpoint, John Day Fossil Beds State Park._ From Picture\r\nGorge to the cliffs opposite, the Picture Gorge Basalts and varicolored\r\nash beds of the John Day Formation rise together nearly 2000 feet. The\r\nbasalt that caps Sheep Rock is an erosional remnant. The lower beds in\r\nthe John Day Formation are colored red by clay eroded from thick soil on\r\nthe Clarno Formation, which is exposed in the farthest red hill. The\r\nsoil was formed by tropical weathering some 30-35 million years ago,\r\nbefore the John Day Formation was laid down. Faulting on a small scale\r\nis illustrated in Sheep Rock, where the thick olive-drab ash flow in the\r\nmiddle of the John Day Formation is offset 75-100 feet (Fig. 6). The\r\nfault slopes about 45° eastward. About two miles downstream, large-scale\r\nmovement on two faults has dropped the basalt flows in Middle Mountain\r\n2000-2500 feet. One of the faults follows along the upstream base of\r\nMiddle Mountain (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5—North-south section along the John Day River\r\nthrough Picture Gorge and Middle Mountain.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.—Geologic map of the John Day Country showing log\r\nroute.]\r\n\r\n                         [Higher-Resolution Map]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                G. 118.7\r\n\r\n_Munro Area, John Day Fossil Beds State Park._ The valley of the John\r\nDay River has been widened to nearly five miles by erosion in the John\r\nDay Formation. Large tilted slide blocks of the John Day Formation and\r\nbasalts jumbled together show how important landsliding of soft beds\r\nunder hard rocks can be in widening valleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.—Sheep Rock from Thomas Condon viewpoint.]\r\n\r\nHere one can appreciate the regularity and extent of basalt flows of the\r\nflood or plateau type, which form the Columbia Plateau. Individual flows\r\nhave been traced 100 miles. Travelers will see few other rocks between\r\nhere and The Dalles, Wenatchee, Pendleton, or Spokane as they cross\r\nparts of the Columbia Plateau.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                H. 116.2\r\n\r\n_Cathedral Rock._ The bluff called Cathedral Rock is the front face of a\r\nlarge block of the John Day Formation that has slid from the west (Fig.\r\n7). Inside the next horseshoe bend downstream a large mass of basalt is\r\ntilted down against Cathedral Rock. From the highway 1.1 miles farther\r\nnorth one can see the side of the tilted block along the river, and the\r\nsame two prominent red and olive-drab ash layers in the high bluff from\r\nwhich the block slid. The horseshoe bend was formed as the river was\r\npushed eastward by the nose of the landslide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.—View of Cathedral Rock and diagram of\r\nlandsliding.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                J. 107.0\r\n\r\n_Kimberly Dike._ The low bluff across the river is formed by a vertical\r\ndike of basalt which is about 60 feet wide. This dike cuts through the\r\nJohn Day Formation and, farther north, the Picture Gorge Basalt (Fig. 8\r\n). It crosses the river valley diagonally and can be traced nearly four\r\nmiles. The dike is formed of once-molten rock that “froze” in a fissure\r\nwhich was a channelway for lava that fed a flow on the earth’s surface.\r\nMany similar dikes are visible along the road east of Kimberly. The\r\nbasaltic magma is believed to have originated at depths of 40 miles or\r\nmore within the part of the earth called the mantle.\r\n\r\n\r\n(At 105.3 turn east on State Highway 402 along the North Fork of the\r\nJohn Day River)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.—Basalt dike two miles south of Kimberly.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 K. 5.0\r\n\r\n_Basalt Dike._ A basalt dike 15 feet wide cuts basalt flows in bluffs\r\nnorth of the road and forms a wall 20 feet high in places; it is visible\r\nalso across the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                L. 11.2\r\n\r\n_Parallel Dikes._ Two prominent parallel dikes, among others, form\r\ncrests of hogbacks south of the river. A small tapering dike cuts pink\r\nand white beds of the John Day Formation in the river bluff. This dike\r\nis the southwest end of an irregular intrusive mass of basalt in which\r\nthe river has cut a steep-walled gorge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                M. 13.2\r\n\r\n_Basalt Intrusion._ The road is cut through 300 feet of basalt intruded\r\ninto the John Day Formation. Both contacts are well exposed. The\r\nbasalt—when molten—baked and reddened 3 to 6 inches of the adjacent\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n(At 13.9 the highway crosses the North Fork of the John Day River and\r\nfollows the Cottonwood Creek Valley.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                N. 18.0\r\n\r\n_Irregular Dikes._ Above the highway several small irregular basalt\r\ndikes cut the white beds of the John Day Formation. Parts of the largest\r\ndike are 10 to 15 feet high.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                O. 20.1\r\n\r\n_Cottonwood Creek Valley._ The view northwestward down Cottonwood Creek\r\ntoward Monument (Fig. 9) exemplifies the development of broad valleys by\r\nerosion in soft beds of the John Day Formation under the gently warped\r\nPicture Gorge Basalt. To the south, the valley ends against massive\r\nrocks of the Clarno Formation which were raised as a block by movement\r\nalong the Hamilton fault. The red beds are in the lower part of the John\r\nDay Formation. Note the contrast between the irregular massive intrusion\r\nin the valley bottom west of Monument and the thin regular basalt flows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.—Northwest view down Cottonwood Creek toward\r\nMonument.]\r\n\r\nOn your right, the irregular contact between the John Day Formation and\r\nPicture Gorge Basalt reveals an ancient landscape buried under lava\r\nflows (Fig. 10). Some of the flows wedge out against former hillsides\r\nand one, marked by the dry falls, fills an old valley.\r\n\r\nFor the next two miles, to the Sunken Mountain viewpoint, the road winds\r\nthrough landslides in the John Day Formation and Picture Gorge Basalt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.—Ancient landscape on John Day Formation buried\r\nunder Picture Gorge Basalt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                P. 22.0\r\n\r\n_Sunken Mountain._ A small landslide in the lower part of the John Day\r\nFormation is called Sunken Mountain. When the valley wall was\r\nover-steepened by normal stream erosion, the jumbled material in the\r\nlower part broke away and slid down from the steep bare slopes above.\r\nAbsence of tilted trees indicates that the slide is not very active now.\r\nThe bare “badland” slopes are being eroded by rain wash. The cliffs of\r\nthe John Day Formation, which the road climbs half a mile farther east,\r\nare the result of rapid but normal headward erosion by the creek.\r\nEventually, because of its lower elevation and steeper gradient, this\r\nbranch of Cottonwood Creek will intercept and behead Deer Creek just\r\neast of Hamilton. A photogenic perspective view of the future stream\r\npiracy can be seen from the road on the ridge just south of Sunken\r\nMountain, about a mile and a half from the highway.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Q. 26.4\r\n\r\n_Long Creek Mountain._ An uplifted block of Picture Gorge Basalt\r\n1400-1500 feet thick forms Long Creek Mountain; Round Basin is eroded in\r\nthe John Day Formation on which the basalt rests (Fig. 11). The base of\r\nthe basalt can be seen in road cuts on either side of Basin Creek. The\r\nHamilton fault follows the gulch to the left just below the parking\r\narea, goes up the tree-filled gulch across Basin Creek, along the low\r\nridge at the northeast edge of Round Basin, and then along the northern\r\nfoot of the mountain. The small slab of basalt south of the fault in\r\nBasin Creek has been tilted about 10° north by downward drag along the\r\nfault. The Hamilton fault system extends about 15 miles farther east.\r\n\r\n\r\n(In Long Creek turn right—south—on U. S. Highway 395).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.—View of Long Creek Mountain and Round Basin, and\r\ndiagram of the geologic structure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.—North-south section across Fox Valley, showing\r\nthe faulted basin structure.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                R. 99.5\r\n\r\n_Fox Valley._ Down-warped flows of Picture Gorge Basalt dip toward Fox\r\nValley from all sides to form a basin (Fig. 12). The valley is eroded\r\nout of ashy beds and gravels of the Mascall Formation which fill the\r\ncenter of the basin to an estimated depth of 1000-1200 feet. Faults form\r\nparts of the northern and southern borders of the basin. The straight,\r\ntimbered, northward-facing steep slope less than a mile southeast of the\r\nviewpoint marks a fault.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                S. 180.3\r\n\r\n_Strawberry Range._ This range and the Aldrich Mountains form a mountain\r\nrange 50 miles long; Strawberry Mountain, altitude 9038 feet above sea\r\nlevel, is its highest peak. The eastern two-thirds of the Strawberry\r\nRange (Fig. 13) was raised as a great block by uplift on the John Day\r\nfault, which follows the northern base of the mountains. The rocks in\r\nStrawberry Mountain and to the east are mostly lavas which poured out\r\nover the land, whereas the Canyon Mountain part of the range consists of\r\ngabbro and peridotite which were intruded at great depth, like granite.\r\n\r\nThe valleys in the higher parts of the range, above about 5000 feet,\r\nwere widened from narrow V’s to their broad U profiles by glaciers\r\nduring the Pleistocene Epoch, or Great Ice Age. The alluvial fans\r\n(Rattlesnake Formation) in front of the mountains were built up of\r\nbouldery gravels and finer sediments. These materials were eroded from\r\nthe mountains, carried by streams down the steep narrow canyons, and\r\nspread out on the valley floor. Because much more material came into the\r\nJohn Day River from the Strawberry Mountains than from the lower\r\nmountains to the north, the river was pushed to the north side of its\r\nwide valley. Faulting and erosion have completely destroyed the cones of\r\nthe volcanoes from which the volcanic rocks were erupted in Miocene and\r\nPliocene time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.—Panorama of the Strawberry Range and the John\r\nDay River valley from the north.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.—Section through the Strawberry Mountain, along\r\nStrawberry Creek.]\r\n\r\n                    [This image in higher resolution]\r\n\r\n_Strawberry Lake and Vicinity._ At Strawberry Camp, about 12 miles south\r\nof Prairie City, the broad floor and steep walls of Strawberry Creek\r\nvalley indicate that the valley has been glaciated. The precipitous\r\ncliffs and rounded valley bottom above Strawberry Lake are\r\ncharacteristic of glaciated mountains (Fig. 15). Strawberry Lake is\r\ndammed by landslides which probably came from the west wall of the\r\nvalley after the glacier melted and left the valley wall over-steepened.\r\nThe hummocky surface and blocky material in the slide are well shown\r\nalong the last half mile of the trail to Strawberry Lake. Strawberry\r\nFalls mark the front of a glacial step over a massive flow of platy\r\nandesite. Little Strawberry Lake is dammed by a low glacial moraine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.—Strawberry Lake, the glaciated valley of\r\nStrawberry Creek, and cirque walls formed by the Strawberry volcanic\r\nplug.]\r\n\r\nMost of the lavas in the Strawberry Mountains were erupted from a\r\ncentral vent about 4000 feet in diameter which is exposed in the cliffs\r\nabove Little Strawberry Lake. The pinnacles known as “Rabbit Ears,”\r\nabove the prominent talus in figure 15, are of vent breccias that\r\nconsist mostly of welded blocks of scoriaceous basalt, but also contain\r\nvolcanic bombs which were blown out as blobs of fluid lava. Huge blocks\r\nof the breccia have fallen onto a gentle bare slope west of Little\r\nStrawberry Lake. The massive, vertically-jointed cliffs are formed of\r\nbasalt which cooled slowly and formed a plug in the throat of the\r\nvolcano after the eruptions ceased. The thin irregular scoriaceous\r\nandesite flows, which are exposed in the cliffs east of Little\r\nStrawberry Lake adjoining the plug, contrast strikingly with the massive\r\neven flows of the Picture Gorge Basalt.\r\n\r\nTilting of the Strawberry Mountain block is shown by the southward dip\r\nof all the flows in the area. The flows in the cliffs west of Strawberry\r\nLake, for example, originally must have sloped northward away from the\r\nvent where they erupted. Their present southward dip of about 15°\r\ntherefore indicates that they have been rotated more than 15° by\r\nfaulting, partly along the northern edge of the mountain range.
