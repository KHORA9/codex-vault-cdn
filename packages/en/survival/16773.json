It was the\r\neastern portal of the old city. From this square radiate several of\r\nthe finest streets, such as Alcala, one of the handsomest\r\nthoroughfares in the world, Mayor, Martera, Carretas, Geronimo. In our\r\nengraving the post office is seen on the right. Large and splendid\r\nbuildings adorn the other sides, which embrace hotels, cafes, reading\r\nrooms, elegant stores, etc. From this square the street railway lines\r\ntraverse the city in all directions. The population of the city is\r\nabout 400,000. It contains many magnificent buildings.

They have the merit of being durable and\r\nfire-proof, and of not being liable to be blown down by violent winds.\r\nIt is very easy to erect them in places where sand and gravel are near\r\nat hand and lime is comparatively cheap. Experiments made in England\r\nshow that coal screenings may be employed to good advantage in the\r\nplace of sand and gravel. Mr. Samuel Preston, of Mount Carroll, Ill.,\r\nhas a dwelling and several other buildings made of concrete and\r\nerected by himself. They were put up in 1851, and are in excellent\r\ncondition. In _The Farmers' Review_ he gives the following directions\r\nfor building concrete walls:\r\n\r\nFirst, secure a good stone foundation, the bottom below frost, the top\r\nabout one foot above ground. Near the top of the foundation bed in 2×4\r\nscantling edgewise transversely with the walls, at such distances\r\napart as the length of the planks that form the boxes to hold the\r\nconcrete may require, the ends of the scantling to run six inches\r\nbeyond the outside and inside of the wall. Now take 2×6 studding, one\r\nfoot longer than the height of the concrete walls are to be, bolt in\r\nan upright position in pairs to each end of the 2×4 scantling, and, if\r\na foot wall is to be built, sixteen inches apart, as the box plank\r\nwill take up four inches. To hold the studding together at the top,\r\ntake pieces of 2×6 lumber, make two mortises in each piece large\r\nenough to slip easily up and down on the studding, forming a tie. Make\r\none mortise long enough to insert a key, so that the studding can be\r\nopened at the top when the box plank are to be raised. When the box\r\nplank are in position, nail cleats with a hole in each of them on each\r\nside of the studding, and corresponding holes in the studding, into\r\nwhich insert a pin to hold the plank to the studding. Bore holes along\r\nup in the studding, to hold the boxes when raised.\r\n\r\nTo make the walls hollow, and I would do it in a building for any\r\npurpose, use inch boards the same width of the box plank, one side\r\nplaned; put the two rough sides together with shingles between,\r\nnailing them together with six-penny nails; place them in the middle\r\nof the wall, the thin end of the shingle down. That gives them a bevel\r\nand can be easily raised with the boxes. To tie the wall together, at\r\nevery third course place strips of boards a little shorter than the\r\nthickness of the wall; cut notches in each so that the concrete will\r\nfill in, holding all fast. The side walls being up, place two inch\r\nplanks on top of the wall upon which to rest the upper joists, put on\r\njoist and rafters, remove the box plank, take inch boards for boxes,\r\ncut to fit between joists and rafters, and fill with concrete to upper\r\nside of rafters, which makes walls that will keep out cold and damp,\r\nall kinds of vermin, and a roof which nothing but a cyclone can\r\nremove. In making door and window frames, make the jambs two inches\r\nnarrower than the thickness of the walls, nailing on temporary two\r\ninch strips.\r\n\r\nMake the mortar bed large enough to hold the material for one course;\r\nput in unslaked quicklime in proportion to 1 to 20 or 30 of other\r\nmaterial; throw into it plenty of water, and don't have that\r\nantediluvian idea that you can drown it; put in clean sand and gravel,\r\nbroken stone, making it thin enough, so that when it is put into boxes\r\nthe thinner portion will run in, filling all interstices, forming a\r\nsolid mass. A brick trowel is necessary to work it down alongside the\r\nboxing plank. One of the best and easiest things to carry the concrete\r\nto the boxes is a railroad wheelbarrow, scooping it in with a scoop\r\nshovel. Two courses a week is about as fast as it will be safe to lay\r\nup the walls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Medical Summary_ recommends the external use of buttermilk to\r\nladies who are exposed to tan or freckles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT CAUSES PAINT TO BLISTER AND PEEL?\r\n\r\nHOW TO PREVENT IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject has been treated by many, but out of the numerous ideas\r\nthat have been brought to bear upon it, the writers have failed to\r\nelucidate the question fully, probably owing to the fact that in most\r\nparts they were themselves dubious as to the real cause. Last year\r\nW.S. gave a lengthy description in the _Building News_, in which he\r\nclassified blistering and peeling of paint into one of blistering\r\nonly. He stated in the beginning of his treatise the following:\r\n\r\n\"The subject of blistering of paint has from time to time engrossed\r\nthe attention of practical men; but so far as we can follow it in the\r\nliterature pertaining to the building trade, its cause has never been\r\nclearly laid down, and hence it is a detail enshrouded in mystery.\"\r\n\r\nW.S. dwells mostly, in his following explanations on blistering\r\npaints, on steam raised in damp wood. Also an English painter,\r\naccording to the _Painters' Journal_, lately reiterates the same\r\ntheory, and gives sundry reasons how water will get into wood through\r\npaint, but is oblivious that the channels which lead water into wood\r\nare open to let it out again. He lays great stress on boiled oil\r\nholding water in suspense to cause blistering, which is merely a\r\nconjecture. Water boils at 212° F. and linseed oil at 600° F.,\r\nconsequently no water can possibly remain after boiling, and a drop of\r\nwater put into boiling oil would cause an explosion too dangerous to\r\nbe encountered.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown herewith that boiled oil, though in general use, is\r\nunfit for durable painting, that it is the cause of most of the\r\ntroubles painters have to contend with, and that raw linseed oil\r\nseasoned by age is the only source to bind pigments for durable\r\npainting; but how to procure it is another trouble to overcome, as all\r\nour American raw linseed oil has been heated by the manufacturers, to\r\nqualify it for quick drying and an early market, thereby impairing its\r\nquality. After linseed oil has been boiled, it becomes a poor varnish;\r\nit remains soft and pliable when used in paint, giving way to air\r\npressure from the wood in hot weather, forming blisters. Turpentine\r\ncauses no blistering; it evaporates upon being exposed, and leaves the\r\npaint in a porous condition for the gas in the wood to escape; but all\r\npainters agree that blistering is caused by gas, and on investigation\r\nwe find two main sources from which gas is generated to blister\r\npaint--one from the wood, the other from the ingredients of the paint.\r\nThe first named source of gas is started in hot weather by expansion\r\nof air confined in painted wood, which presses against the paint and\r\nraises blisters when the paint is too soft to resist. Tough,\r\nwell-cemented paint resists the pressure and keeps the air back. These\r\nblisters mostly subside as soon as the air cools and returns to the\r\npores, but subsequently peel off.\r\n\r\nW.S. and others assert that damp in painted wood turns into steam when\r\nexposed to sun heat, forming blisters, which cannot be possible when\r\nwe know that water does not take a gaseous form (steam) at less than\r\n212° F. They have very likely been deluded by the known way of\r\ndistilling water with the aid of sunshine without concentrating the\r\nrays of the sun, based upon the solubility of water in air, viz.: Air\r\nholds more water in solution (or suspension) in a warmer than in a\r\ncooler degree of temperature; by means of a simple apparatus\r\nsun-heated air is guided over sun-heated water, when the air saturated\r\nwith water is conducted into a cooler, to give up its water again. But\r\nwater has an influence toward hastening to blister paint; it holds the\r\nunhardened woodsap in solution, forming a slight solvent of the oil,\r\nthereby loosening the paint from the wood, favoring blistering and\r\npeeling. There is a certain kind of blister which appears in certain\r\nspots or places only, and nowhere else, puzzling many painters. The\r\nexplanation of this is the same as before--soft paint at these spots,\r\ncaused by accident or sluggish workmen having saturated the wood with\r\ncoal oil, wax, tar, grease, or any other paint-softening material\r\nbefore the wood was painted, which reacts on the paint to give way to\r\nair pressure, forming blisters.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of paint blistering from the ingredients of the paint\r\nhappens between any layer of paint or varnish on wood, iron, stone, or\r\nany other substance. Its origin is the gaseous formation of volatile\r\noils during the heated season, of which the lighter coal oils play the\r\nmost conspicuous part; they being less valuable than all other\r\nvolatile oils, are used in low priced japan driers and varnishes.\r\nThese volatile oils take a gaseous form at different temperatures, lie\r\npartly dormant until the thermometer hovers at 90° F. in the shade,\r\nwhen they develop into gas, forming blisters in airtight paint, or\r\nescape unnoticed in porous paint. This is the reason why coal-tar\r\npaint is so liable to blister in hot weather; an elastic, soft\r\ncoal-tar covering holds part of its volatile oil confined until heated\r\nto generate into gas; a few drops only of such oil is sufficient to\r\nspoil the best painted work, and worse, when it has been applied in\r\npriming, it settles into the pores of the wood, needing often from two\r\nto three repetitions of scraping and repainting before the evil is\r\novercome. Now, inasmuch as soft drying paint is unfit to answer the\r\npurpose, it is equally as bad when paint too hard or brittle has been\r\nused, that does not expand and contract in harmony with the painted\r\narticle, causing the paint to crack and peel off, which is always the\r\ncase when either oil or varnish has been too sparingly and turpentine\r\ntoo freely used. Intense cold favors the action, when all paints\r\nbecome very brittle, a fact much to be seen on low-priced vehicles in\r\nwinter time. Damp in wood will also hasten it, as stated in\r\nblistering, the woodsap undermining the paint.\r\n\r\nTo avoid peeling and blistering, the paint should be mixed with raw\r\nlinseed oil in such proportions that it neither becomes too brittle\r\nnor too soft when dry. Priming paint with nearly all oil and hardly\r\nany pigment is the foundation of many evils in painting; it leaves too\r\nmuch free oil in the paint, forming a soft undercoat. For durable\r\npainting, paint should be mixed with as much of a base pigment as it\r\ncan possibly be spread with a brush, giving a thin coat and forming a\r\nchemical combination called soap. To avoid an excess of oil, the\r\nfollowing coats need turpentine to insure the same proportion of oil\r\nand pigment. As proof of this, prime a piece of wood and a piece of\r\niron with the same paint; when the wood takes up part of the oil from\r\nthe paint and leaves the rest in proportion to harden well, where at\r\nthe same time the paint on iron remains soft. To be more lucid, it\r\nneed be explained, linseed oil boiled has lost its oleic acid and\r\nglycerine ether, which form with the bases of pigments the insoluble\r\nsoap, as well as its albumen, which in boiling is thrown out. It\r\ncoagulates at 160° F. heat; each is needed to better withstand the\r\naction of wind and weather, preventing the dust from attaching itself\r\nto a painted surface, a channel for ammonia in damp weather to\r\ndissolve and wash off the paint. In later years linseed oil has been\r\nextracted from linseed meal by the aid of naphtha and percolation, the\r\nproduct of a very clear, quick drying oil, but lacking in its binding\r\nquality, no doubt caused by the naphtha dissolving the fatty matter\r\nonly, leaving the glycerine and albumen in the meal.\r\n\r\nAll pigments of paint group according to their affinity to raw linseed\r\noil into three classes. First, those that form chemical combinations,\r\ncalled soap. This kind is the most durable, is used for priming\r\npurposes, and consists of lead, zinc, and iron bases, of which red\r\nlead takes up the most oil; next, white lead, the pure carbonate Dutch\r\nprocess made, following with zinc white and iron carbonates, as iron\r\nore paint, Turkey umber, yellow ocher; also faintly the chromates of\r\nlead--chrome-green and chrome-yellow, finishing with the poorest of\r\nall, modern white lead, made by the wet or vinegar process. The second\r\nclass being neutrals have no chemical affinity to linseed oil; they\r\nneed a large quantity of drier to harden the paint, and include all\r\nblacks, vermilion, Prussian, Paris, and Chinese blue, also terra di\r\nSienna, Vandyke brown, Paris green, verdigris, ultramarine, genuine\r\ncarmine, and madderlake. The last seven are, on account of their\r\ntransparency, better adapted for varnish mixtures--glazing. The third\r\nclass of pigments act destructively to linseed oil; they having an\r\nacid base (mostly tin salt, hydrochloride of tin, and redwood dye),\r\nform with the gelatinous matter of the oil a jelly that will neither\r\nwork well under the brush nor harden sufficiently, and can be used in\r\nvarnish for glazing only; they are not permanent in color, and among\r\nthe most troublesome are the lower grades of so-called carmines,\r\nmadderlakes, rose pinks, etc., which contain more or less acidous\r\ndyes, forming a soft paint with linseed oil that once dry on a job can\r\nbe twisted or peeled off like the skin of a ripe peach. All these\r\ncombinations of paint have to be closely observed by the painter to\r\ninsure his success.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago a house needed to be painted outside but once in\r\nfrom five to seven years; it looked well all the time, as no dust\r\nsettled in the paint to make it unsightly. Painters then used the\r\nDutch-process-made white-lead, a base and raw linseed oil, a fat acid,\r\nwhich formed the insoluble soap. They also put turpentine in the\r\nfollowing coats, to keep up the proportions of oil and pigment. All\r\nheld out well against wind and weather. Now they use the\r\nwet-process-made white lead, neutralized by vinegar, with oil\r\nneutralized by boiling, from the first to the last coat, and--fail in\r\nmaking their work permanent.\r\n\r\nW.S., in the _Building News_, relates an unaccountable mysterious\r\nblistering in a leaky house, where the rainwater came from above on a\r\npainted wood wall, blistering the paint in streaks and filled at the\r\nlower ends with water, which no doubt was caused by the water soaking\r\nthe wood at the upper ends where there was no paint, and following it\r\ndown through the fibers, pushed and peeled off the soft, inadhesive\r\npaint. Green, sappy, and resinous wood is unfit for durable painting,\r\nand to avoid blistering and peeling wood should be well seasoned and\r\nprimed with all raw linseed oil, some drier, to insure a moderately\r\nslow drying, and as much of a base pigment as the painter can possibly\r\nspread (much drier takes up too much oil acid, needed for the pigment\r\nbase to combine with), which insures a tough paint that never fails to\r\nstand against blistering or peeling, as well as wind, weather, and\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\nThe coach, car, and house painter can materially improve his painting\r\nwhere his needs lie by first oiling the wood with raw oil, then\r\nsmoothing the surface down with lump pumicestone, washing it with a\r\nmixture of japan drier or, better yet, gold sizing and turpentine,\r\nwiping dry, and following it up with a coat of white lead, oil, and\r\nturpentine. The explanation is: the raw oil penetrates the wood and\r\nraises the wood fibers on the surface to be rubbed down with\r\npumicestone, insuring the best surface for the following painting: to\r\nharden the oil in the wood it receives a coat of japan drier, which\r\nfollows into the pores and there forms a tough, resinous matter,\r\nresisting any air pressure that might arise from within, and at the\r\nsame time reacts on the first coat of lead as a drier. This mode\r\ninsures the smoothest and toughest foundation for the following\r\npainting, and may be exposed to the hottest July sun without fear of\r\neither blistering or peeling.\r\n\r\nLOUIS MATERN.\r\n\r\nBloomington, Ill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIVE OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following particulars with regard to the production of olive oil\r\nin Tuscany have been furnished to Mr. Consul Inglis by one of the\r\nprincipal exporters in Leghorn:\r\n\r\nThe olive oil produced in Tuscany from the first pressing of the fruit\r\nis intended for consumption as an article of food. Hence, great\r\nattention is paid both to the culture of the olive tree and the\r\nprocess of making oil.\r\n\r\nThe olive crop is subject to many vicissitudes, and is an uncertain\r\none. It may be taken as a rule that a good crop does not occur more\r\nfrequently than once in three years. A prolonged drought in summer may\r\ncause the greater part of the small fruit to fall off the trees. A\r\nwarm and wet autumn will subject the fruit to the ravages of a maggot\r\nor worm, which eats its way into it. Fruit thus injured falls to the\r\nground prematurely, and the oil made from it is of very bad quality,\r\nbeing nauseous in taste and somewhat thick and viscous. Frost\r\nfollowing immediately on a fall of snow or sleet, when the trees are\r\nstill wet, will irretrievably damage the fruit, causing it to shrivel\r\nup and greatly diminishing the yield of oil, while the oil itself has\r\na dark color, and loses its delicate flavor.\r\n\r\nThe olive tree in Tuscany generally blossoms in April. By November the\r\nfruit has attained its full size, though not full maturity, and the\r\nolive harvest generally commences then. The fruit, generally speaking,\r\nis gathered as it falls to the ground, either from ripeness or in\r\nwindy weather. In some districts, however, and when the crop is short,\r\nthe practice is to strip the fruit from the trees early in the season.\r\nWhen there is a full crop the harvest lasts many months, and may not\r\nbe finished till the end of May, as the fruit does not all ripen\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nOil made early in the season has a deeper color, and is distinguished\r\nby a fruity flavor, with a certain degree of pungency; while as the\r\nseason advances it becomes lighter in color, thinner in body, and\r\nmilder and sweeter in taste. Oil made toward the close of the harvest\r\nin April or May from extremely ripe fruit is of a very pale straw\r\ncolor, mild and sweet to the taste, though sometimes, if the fruit has\r\nremained too long on the trees, it may be slightly rancid. Oil very\r\nlight in color is much prized in certain countries, notably France,\r\nand hence, if it also possesses good quality, commands a higher price\r\nin the Tuscan markets.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the olive tree varies just as much in quality as does the\r\ngrape, according to the species of the tree itself, the nature of the\r\nsoil, exposure, and climate of the locality where it grows. Some\r\nvarieties of the olive tree largely grown, because thought to be\r\nbetter suited to the special conditions of some districts, yield a\r\nfruit which imparts a bitter taste to the oil made from it; such oil,\r\neven when otherwise perfect, ranks as a second rate quality.\r\n\r\nThe highest quality of oil can only be obtained when the fruit is\r\nperfectly and uniformly sound, well ripened, gathered as soon as it\r\nhas dropped from the trees, and crushed immediately with great\r\nattention. Should the fruit remain any time on the ground,\r\nparticularly during wet weather, it deteriorates fast and gets an\r\nearthy taste; while if allowed to remain an undue length of time in\r\nthe garners it heats, begins to decompose, and will yield only bad\r\noil.\r\n\r\nThe process of making oil is as follows: The fruit is crushed in a\r\nstone mill, generally moved by water power; the pulp is then put into\r\nbags made of fiber, and a certain number of these bags, piled one upon\r\nanother, are placed in a press, most frequently worked by hand; when\r\npressure is applied, the oil flows down into a channel by which it is\r\nconveyed to a receptacle or tank.\r\n\r\nWhen oil ceases to flow, tepid water is poured upon the bags to carry\r\noff oil retained by the bags. The pulp is then removed from the bags,\r\nground again in the mill, then replaced in the bags, and pressed a\r\nsecond time. The water used in the process of making oil must be quite\r\npure; the mill, press, bags, and vessels sweet and clean, as the least\r\ntaint would ruin the quality of the oil produced.\r\n\r\nThe oil which has collected in the tank or receptacle just mentioned\r\nis removed day by day, and the water also drained off, as oil would\r\nsuffer in quality if left in contact with water; the water also, which\r\nnecessarily contains some oil mingled with it, is sent to a deposit\r\noutside, and at some distance from the crushing house, which is called\r\nthe \"Inferno,\" where it is allowed to accumulate, and the oil which\r\ncomes to the surface is skimmed off from time to time. It is fit only\r\nfor manufacturing purposes.\r\n\r\nAfter the second pressing the olive-pulp is not yet done with; it is\r\nbeaten up with water by mechanical agitators moved by water-power, and\r\nthen the whole discharged into open-air tanks adjoining the crushing\r\nhouse. There the crushed olive kernels sink to the bottom, are\r\ngathered up and sold for fuel, fetching about 12 francs per 1,000\r\nkilos, while the _debris_ of the pulp is skimmed off the surface of\r\nthe tank and again pressed in bags, yielding a considerable quantity\r\nof inferior oil, called \"olio lavato,\" or washed oil, which, if\r\nfreshly made, is even used for food by the poorer classes. The pulp\r\nthen remaining has still further use. It is sold for treatment in\r\nfactories by the sulphide of carbon process, and by this method yields\r\nfrom seven to nine per cent. of oil, of course suitable only for\r\nmanufacturing purposes. Only the first two pressings yield oil which\r\nranks as first quality, subject of course to the condition of the\r\nfruit being unexceptionable. New oil is allowed to rest a while in\r\norder to get rid of sediment; it is then clarified by passing through\r\nclean cotton wool, when it is fit for use.\r\n\r\nThe highest quality of olive oil for eating purposes should not only\r\nbe free from the least taint in taste or smell, but possessed of a\r\ndelicate, appetizing flavor. When so many favorable conditions are\r\nneeded as to growth, maturity, and soundness of the fruit, coupled\r\nwith great attention during the process of oil-making, it is not to be\r\nwondered at that by no means all or even the greater part of the oil\r\nproduced in the most favored districts of Tuscany is of the highest\r\nquality. On the contrary, the bulk is inferior and defective.\r\n\r\nThese defective oils are largely dealt in both for home consumption\r\nand export, when price and not quality is the object.\r\n\r\nIn foreign countries there is always a market for inferior, defective\r\nolive oil for cooking purposes, etc., provided the price be low. Price\r\nand not quality is the object, so much so that when olive oil is dear,\r\ncotton-seed, ground-nut, and other oils are substituted, which bear\r\nthe same relation to good olive oil that butterine and similar\r\npreparations do to real butter.\r\n\r\nThe very choicest qualities of pure olive oil are largely shipped from\r\nLeghorn to England, along with the very lowest qualities, often also\r\nadulterated.\r\n\r\nThe oil put into Florence flasks is of the latter kind. Many years\r\nback this was not the case, but now it is a recognized fact that\r\nnothing but the lowest quality of oil is put into these flasks; oil\r\nutterly unfit for food, and so bad that it is a mystery to what use it\r\nis applied in England. Importers in England of oil in these flasks\r\ncare nothing, however, about quality; cheapness is the only\r\ndesideratum.\r\n\r\nThe best quality of Tuscan olive oil is imported in London in casks,\r\nbottled there, and bears the name of the importers alone on the label.\r\nThere is no difficulty in procuring in England the best Tuscan oil,\r\nwhich nothing produced elsewhere can surpass; but consumers who wish\r\nto get, and are willing to pay for, the best article must look to the\r\nname and reputation of the importers and the general excellence of all\r\nthe articles they sell, which is the best guarantee they can have of\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEESWAX AND ITS ADULTERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeeswax is a peculiar waxy substance secreted only by bees, and\r\nconsisting of 80.2 per cent. carbon, 13.4 per cent. hydrogen, and 6.4\r\nper cent. oxygen. It is a mixture of myricine, cerotic acid, and\r\ncerolein, the first of which is insoluble in boiling alcohol, the\r\nsecond is soluble in hot alcohol and crystallizes out on cooling,\r\nwhile the third remains dissolved in cold alcohol.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are unable to produce real beeswax artificially, there are\r\nmany imitations which are made use of to adulterate the genuine\r\narticle, and their detection is a matter of considerable difficulty.\r\nHuebl says (_Dingl. Jour._, p. 338) that the most reliable method of\r\nestimating the adulteration of beeswax is that proposed by Becker, and\r\nknown as the saponification method.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of potassic hydrate required to saponify one gramme or 15\r\ngrains of pure beeswax varies from 97 to 107 milligrammes. Other kinds\r\nof wax and its substitutes require in some cases more and in others\r\nless of the alkali. This method would, however, lead to very erroneous\r\nconclusions if applied to a mixture of which some of the constituents\r\nhave higher saponification numbers than beeswax and others higher, as\r\none error would balance the other.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, the quantity of alkali required to saponify the\r\nmyricine is first ascertained, and then that required to saturate the\r\nfree cerotic acid. In this way two numbers are obtained; and in an\r\ninvestigation of twenty samples of Austrian yellow beeswax, the author\r\nfound these numbers stood to each other almost in the constant ratio\r\nof 1 to 3.70. Although this ratio cannot be considered as definitely\r\nestablished by so few experiments, it may serve as a guide in judging\r\nof the purity of beeswax.\r\n\r\nThe experiment is carried out as follows: 3 or 4 grammes of the wax\r\nthat has been melted in water are put in 20 c.c. of neutral 95 per\r\ncent, alcohol, and warmed until the wax melts, when phenolphthaleine\r\nis added, and enough of an alcoholic solution of potash run in from a\r\nburette until on shaking it retains a faint but permanent red color.\r\nThe burette used by the author is divided in 0.05 c.c. After adding 20\r\nc.c. more of a half normal potash solution, it is heated on a water\r\nbath for ¾ hour. Then the uncombined excess of alkali is titrated with\r\nhalf normal hydrochloric acid. The alcohol must be tested as to its\r\nreaction before using it, and carefully neutralized with the acid of\r\nphenolphthalein.\r\n\r\nTo saturate the free acid in 1 gramme of wax requires 19 to 21\r\nmilligrammes of potassic hydrate, while 73 to 76 milligrammes more are\r\nnecessary to saponify the myricine ether. The lower numbers in the one\r\nusually occur with low numbers for the other, so that the proportions\r\nremain 1 to 3.6 or 1 to 3.8.\r\n\r\nFor comparison he gives the following numbers obtained with one gramme\r\nof the more common adulterants:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ----------------+----------+----------+---------+--------+\r\n                  |    To    |    To    |  Total  |        |\r\n                  |neutralize|  convert |saponifi-|        |\r\n                  | the acid.|the ether.| cation. | Ratio. |\r\n  ----------------+----------+----------+---------+--------+\r\n  Japanese wax    |     20   |   200    |   220   |  10    |\r\n  Carnauba wax    |      4   |    75    |    79   |  19    |\r\n  Tallow          |      4   |   176    |   180   |  44    |\r\n  Stearic acid    |    195   |     0    |   195   |  0/195 |\r\n  Rosin           |    110   |     1.6  |   112   |  0.015 |\r\n  Paraffine       |      0   |     0    |     0   |  0     |\r\n  Ceresine        |      0   |     0    |     0   |  0     |\r\n  Yellow beeswax  |     20   |    75    |    95   |  3.75  |\r\n  ----------------+----------+----------+---------+--------+\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author deduces the following conclusions as the results of these\r\ninvestigations:\r\n\r\n1. If the numbers obtained lie between these limits, 19 to 21, 73 to\r\n76, 92 to 97, and 3.6 to 3.8 respectively, it may be assumed that the\r\nbeeswax is pure, provided it also corresponds to beeswax in its\r\nphysical properties.\r\n\r\n2. If the saponification figures fall below 92 and yet the ratio is\r\ncorrect, it is adulterated with some neutral substance like paraffine.\r\n\r\n3. If the ratio is above 3.8, it is very probable that Japanese or\r\ncarnauba wax or grease has been added.\r\n\r\n4. If the ratio falls below 3.6, stearic acid or resin has been used\r\nas the adulterant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHENOL IN THE STEM, LEAVES, AND CONES OF PINUS SYLVESTRIS.\r\n\r\nA DISCOVERY BEARING ON THE FLORA OF THE CARBONIFEROUS EPOCH AND THE\r\nFORMATION OF PETROLEUM.\r\n\r\nBy A.B. GRIFFITHS, Ph.D., F.C.S. Membre de la Societe Chimique de\r\nParis, Medallist in Chemistry and Botany, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving found, in small quantities, alcohols of the C_{n}H_{2n-7}\r\nseries, last summer, in the stem, acicular leaves, and cones of _Pinus\r\nsylvestris_, I wish in this paper to say a few words on the subject.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I took a number of cones, cut them up into small pieces,\r\nand placed them in a large glass beaker, then nearly filled it with\r\ndistilled water, and heated to about 80° C., keeping the decoction at\r\nthis temperature for about half an hour, I occasionally stirred with a\r\nglass rod, and then allowed it to cool, and filtered. This filtrate\r\nwas then evaporated nearly to dryness, when a small quantity of\r\nsix-sided prisms crystallized out, which subsequently were found to be\r\nthe hydrate of phenol (C_{6}H_{5}HO)_{2}H_{2}O. Its melting point was\r\nfound to be 17.2° C. Further, the crystals already referred to were\r\ndissolved in ether, and then allowed to evaporate, when long colorless\r\nneedles were obtained, which, on being placed in a dry test tube and\r\nthe tube placed in a water bath kept at 42° C., were found to melt;\r\nand on making a careful combustion analysis of these crystals, the\r\nfollowing composition was obtained:\r\n\r\n                   Carbon     76.6\r\n                   Hydrogen    6.4\r\n                   Oxygen     17.0\r\n                             -----\r\n                             100.0\r\n\r\nThis gives C_{6}H_{6}O, which is the formula for phenol.\r\n\r\nOn dissolving some of these crystals in water (excess) and adding\r\nferric chloride, a beautiful violet color was imparted to the\r\nsolution. To another aqueous solution of the crystals was added\r\nbromine water, and a white precipitate was obtained, consisting of\r\ntribromophenol. An aqueous solution of the crystals immediately\r\ncoagulated albumen.\r\n\r\nAll these reactions show that the phenol occurs in the free state in\r\nthe cones of this plant. In the same manner I treated the acicular\r\nleaves, and portions of the stem separately, both being previously cut\r\nup into small pieces, and from both I obtained phenol.\r\n\r\nI have ascertained the relative amount of phenol in each part of the\r\nplant operated upon; by heating the stem with water at 80° C., and\r\nfiltering, and repeating this operation until the aqueous filtrate\r\ngave no violet color with ferric chloride and no white precipitate\r\nwith bromine water.\r\n\r\nI found various quantities according to the age of the stem. The older\r\nportions yielding as much as 0.1021 per cent, while the young portions\r\nonly gave 0.0654 per cent. The leaves yielding according to their age,\r\n0.0936 and 0.0315 per cent.; and the cones also gave varying amounts,\r\naccording to their maturity, the amounts varying between 0.0774 and\r\n0.0293.\r\n\r\nTwo methods were used in the quantitative estimation of the amount of\r\nphenol. The first was the new volumetric method of M. Chandelon\r\n(_Bulletin de la Societe Chemique de Paris_, July 20, 1882; and\r\n_Deutsch-Americanishe Apotheker Zeitung_, vol. iii., No. 12, September\r\n1, 1882), which I have found to be very satisfactory. The process\r\ndepends on the precipitation of phenol by a dilute aqueous solution of\r\nbromine as tribromophenol. The second method was to extract, as\r\nalready staled, a known weight of each part of the plant with water,\r\nuntil the last extract gives _no_ violet color with ferric chloride,\r\nand no white precipitate with the bromine test (which is capable of\r\ndetecting in a solution the 1/60000 part of phenol). The aqueous\r\nextract is at this point evaporated, then ether is added, and finally\r\nthe ethereal solution is allowed to evaporate. The residue (phenol) is\r\nweighed directly, and from this the percentage can be ascertained. By\r\nthis method of extraction, the oil of turpentine, resins, etc.,\r\ncontained in _Pinus sylvestris_ do not pass into solution, because\r\nthey are insoluble in water, even when boiling; what passes into\r\nsolution besides phenol is a little tannin, which is practically\r\ninsoluble in ether.\r\n\r\nFrom this investigation it will be seen that phenol exists in various\r\nproportions in the free state in the leaves, stem, and cones of _Pinus\r\nsylvestris_, and as this compound is a product in the distillation of\r\ncoal, and as geologists have to a certain extent direct evidence that\r\nthe flora of the Carboniferous epoch was essentially crytogamous, the\r\nonly phænogamous plants which constituted any feature in \"the coal\r\nforests\" being the coniferæ, and as coal is the fossil remains of that\r\ngigantic flora which contained phenol, I think my discovery of phenol\r\nin the coniferæ of the present day further supports, from a chemical\r\npoint of view, the views of geologists that the coniferæ existed so\r\nfar back in the world's history as the Carboniferous age.\r\n\r\nI think this discovery also supports the theory that the origin of\r\npetroleum in nature is produced by moderate heat on coal or similar\r\nmatter of a vegetable origin. For we know from the researches of\r\nFreund and Pebal (_Ann. Chem. Pharm._, cxv. 19), that petroleum\r\ncontains phenol and its homologues, and as I have found this organic\r\ncompound in the coniferæ of to-day, it is probable that petroleum in\r\ncertain areas has been produced from the conifers and the flora\r\ngenerally of some primæval forests. It is stated by numerous chemists\r\nthat \"petroleum almost always contains solid paraffin\" and similar\r\nhydrocarbons. Professors Schorlemmer and Thorpe have found heptane in\r\nPinus, which heptane yielded primary heptyl-alcohol, and\r\nmethyl-pentyl-carbinol, exactly as the heptane obtained from petroleum\r\ndoes (_Annalen de Chemie_, ccxvii., 139, and clxxxviii., 249; and\r\n_Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft_, viii., 1649); and,\r\nfurther, petroleum contains a large number of hydrocarbons which are\r\nfound in coal. Again, Mendelejeff, Beilstein, and others (_Bulletin de\r\nla Societe Chemique de Paris_, No. 1, July 5, 1883), have found\r\nhydrocarbons of the--\r\n\r\n             C_{n}H_{2n2+}, C_{n}H_{2n-6},\r\n\r\nalso hydrocarbons of the C_{n}H_{2n} series in the petroleum of Baku,\r\nAmerican petroleum containing similar hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\nI think all these facts give very great weight to the theory that\r\npetroleum is of organic origin.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Berthelot, from his synthetic production of\r\nhydrocarbons, believes that the interior of the globe contains\r\nalkaline metals in the _free_ state, which yield acetylides in the\r\npresence of carbonic anhydride, which are decomposed into acetylene by\r\naqueous vapor. But it has been already proved that acetylene may be\r\npolymerized, so as to produce aromatic carbides, or the derivatives of\r\nmarsh gas, by the absorption of hydrogen. Berthelot's view, therefore,\r\nis too imaginative; for the presence of _free_ alkaline metals in the\r\nearth's interior is an unproved and very improbable hypothesis.\r\nByasson states that petroleum is formed by the action of water,\r\ncarbonic anhydride, and sulphureted hydrogen upon incandescent iron.\r\nMendelejeff thinks it is formed by the action of aqueous vapor upon\r\ncarbides of iron; and in his article, \"Petroleum, the Light of the\r\nPoor\" (in this month's--February--number of _Good Words_), Sir Lyon\r\nPlayfair, K.C.B., F.R.S., etc., holds opinions similar to those of\r\nMendelejeff.\r\n\r\nTaking in consideration the facts that solid paraffin is found in\r\npetroleum and is also found in coal, and from my own work that phenol\r\nexists in _Pinus sylvestris_, and has been found by others in coal\r\nwhich is produced from the decomposition of a flora containing\r\nnumerous gigantic coniferæ allied to Pinus, and that petroleum\r\ncontains phenol, and each (i.e., petroleum and coal) contains a number\r\nof hydrocarbons common to both, I am inclined to think that the\r\nbalance of evidence is in favor of the hypothesis that petroleum has\r\nbeen produced in nature from a vegetable source in the interior of the\r\nglobe. Of course, there can be no practical or direct evidence as to\r\nthe origin of petroleum; therefore \"theories are the only lights with\r\nwhich we can penetrate the obscurity of the unknown, and they are to\r\nbe valued just as far as they illuminate our path.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think that there is a connecting link between the old\r\npine and fir forest of bygone ages and the origin of petroleum in\r\nnature.--_Chemical News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF PARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently we paid a visit to the New Municipal School of Physics and\r\nChemistry that the city of Paris founded in 1882, and that is now in\r\noperation in the large building of the old Rollin College. This\r\nestablishment is one of those that supply a long-felt want of our\r\ntime, and we are happy to make it known to our readers. The object for\r\nwhich it was designed was, in the intention of its founders, to give\r\nyoung people who have just graduated from the higher primary schools\r\nspecial instruction which shall be at once scientific and practical,\r\nand which shall fit them to become engineers or superintendents in\r\nlaboratories connected with chemical and physical industries. To reach\r\nsuch a result it has been necessary to give the teaching an\r\nessentially practical character, by permitting the pupils to proceed\r\nof themselves in manipulations in well fitted laboratories. It is upon\r\nthis important point that we shall now more particularly dwell; but,\r\nbefore making known the general mode of teaching, we wish to quote a\r\nfew passages from the school's official programme:\r\n\r\n   \"Many questions and problems, in physics as well as in chemistry,\r\n   find their solution only with the aid of mathematics and\r\n   mechanics. It therefore became necessary, through lectures\r\n   bearing upon the useful branches of mathematics, to supplement\r\n   the too limited ideas that pupils brought with them on entering\r\n   the school. Mathematics and mechanics are therefore taught here\r\n   at the same time with physics and chemistry, but they are merely\r\n   regarded in the light of auxiliaries to the latter.\r\n\r\n   \"The studies extend over three years. Each of the three divisions\r\n   (1st, 2d, and 3d years) includes thirty pupils.\r\n\r\n   \"During the three first semesters, pupils of the same grade\r\n   attend lectures and go through manipulations in chemistry,\r\n   physics, mathematics, and draughting in common.\r\n\r\n   \"At the end of the third semester they are divided into 10\r\n   physical and 20 chemical students.\r\n\r\n   \"From this moment, although certain courses still remain wholly\r\n   or partially common to the two categories of pupils (physical and\r\n   chemical), the same is no longer the case with regard to the\r\n   practical exercises, for the physical students thereafter\r\n   manipulate only in the physical laboratories, and the chemical\r\n   only in the chemical laboratories; moreover, the manipulations\r\n   acquire a greater importance through the time that is devoted to\r\n   them.\r\n\r\n   \"At each promotion the three first semesters are taken up with\r\n   general and scientific studies. Technical applications are the\r\n   subject of the lectures and exercises of the three last\r\n   semesters. At the end of the third year certificates are given to\r\n   those pupils who have undergone examination in a satisfactory\r\n   manner, and diplomas to such as have particularly distinguished\r\n   themselves.\"\r\n\r\nWhen pupils have been received at the school, after passing the\r\nnecessary examination, their time of working is divided up between\r\nlectures and questionings and different laboratory manipulations.\r\n\r\nThe course of lectures on general and applied physics comprises\r\nhydrostatics and heat (Prof. Dommer), electricity and magnetism (Prof.\r\nHospitalier), and optics and acoustics (Prof. Baille). Lectures on\r\ngeneral chemistry are delivered by Profs. Schultzenberger and\r\nHenninger, on analytical chemistry by Prof. Silva, on chemistry\r\napplied to the industries by Prof. Henninger (for inorganic) and Prof.\r\nSchultzenberger (for organic). The lectures on pure and applied\r\nmathematics and mechanics are delivered by Profs. Levy and Roze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF A LABORATORY AT THE PARIS SCHOOL OF\r\nPHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY.]\r\n\r\nThe pupils occupy themselves regularly every day, during half the time\r\nspent at the school, with practical work in analytical and applied\r\nchemistry and physics and general chemistry. This practical work is a\r\ncomplement to the various lectures, and has reference to what has been\r\ntaught therein. Once or twice per week the pupils spend three hours in\r\na shop devoted to wood and metal working, and learn how to turn,\r\nforge, file, adjust, etc.\r\n\r\nThe school's cabinets are now provided with the best instruments for\r\nstudy, and are daily becoming richer therein. The chemical\r\nlaboratories are none the less remarkably organized. In the\r\naccompanying cut we give a view of one of these--the one that is under\r\nthe direction of Mr. Schultzenberger, professor of chemistry and\r\ndirector of the new school. Each pupil has his own place in front of a\r\nlarge table provided with a stand whereon he may arrange all the\r\nproducts that he has to employ. Beneath the work-table he has at his\r\ndisposal a closet in which to place his apparatus after he is through\r\nusing them. Each pupil has in front of him a water-faucet, which is\r\nfixed to a vertical column and placed over a sink. Alongside of this\r\nfaucet there is a double gas burner, which may be connected with\r\nfurnaces and heating apparatus by means of rubber tubing. A special\r\nhall, with draught and ventilation, is set apart for precipitations by\r\nsulphureted hydrogen and the preparation of chlorine and other\r\nill-smelling and deleterious gases. The great amount of light and\r\nspace provided secure the best of conditions of hygiene to this fine\r\nand vast laboratory, where young people have all the necessary\r\nrequisites for becoming true chemists.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUST-FREE SPACES.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: Lecture to the Royal Dublin Society by Dr. Oliver J.\r\n   Lodge, April 2, 1884.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years a singular interest has arisen in the\r\nsubject of dust, smoke, and fog, and several scientific researches\r\ninto the nature and properties of these phenomena have been recently\r\nconducted. It so happened that at the time I received a request from\r\nthe secretary of this society to lecture here this afternoon I was in\r\nthe middle of a research connected with dust, which I had been\r\ncarrying on for some months in conjunction with Mr. J.W. Clark,\r\nDemonstrator of Physics in University College, Liverpool, and which\r\nhad led us to some interesting results. It struck me that possibly\r\nsome sort of account of this investigation might not be unacceptable\r\nto a learned body such as this, and accordingly I telegraphed off to\r\nMr. Moss the title of this afternoon's lecture. But now that the time\r\nhas come for me to approach the subject before you, I find myself\r\nconscious of some misgivings, and the misgivings are founded upon this\r\nground: that the subject is not one that lends itself easily to\r\nexperimental demonstration before an audience. Many of the experiments\r\ncan only be made on a small scale, and require to be watched closely.\r\nHowever, by help of diagrams and by not confining myself too closely\r\nto our special investigation, but dealing somewhat with the wider\r\nsubject of dust in general, I may hope to render myself and my subject\r\nintelligible if not very entertaining.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I draw no distinction between \"dust\" and \"smoke.\" It\r\nwould be possible to draw such a distinction, but it would hardly be\r\nin accordance with usage. Dust might be defined as smoke which had\r\nsettled, and the term smoke applied to solid particles still suspended\r\nin the air. But at present the term \"smoke\" is applied to solid\r\nparticles produced by combustion only, and \"dust\" to particles owing\r\ntheir floating existence to some other cause. This is evidently an\r\nunessential distinction, and for the present I shall use either term\r\nwithout distinction, meaning by dust or smoke, solid particles\r\nfloating in the air. Then \"fog\"; this differs from smoke only in the\r\nfact that the particles are liquid instead of solid. And the three\r\nterms dust, smoke, and fog, come to much the same thing, only that the\r\nlatter term is applied when the suspended particles are liquid. I do\r\nnot think, however, that we usually apply the term \"fog\" when the\r\nliquid particles are pure water; we call it then mostly either mist or\r\ncloud. The name \"fog,\" at any rate in towns, carries with it the idea\r\nof a hideous, greasy compound, consisting of smoke and mist and\r\nsulphur and filth, as unlike the mists on a Highland mountain as a\r\ncountry meadow is unlike a city slum. Nevertheless, the finest cloud\r\nor mist that ever existed consists simply of little globules of water\r\nsuspended in air, and thus for our present purpose differs in no\r\nimportant respect from fog, dust, and smoke. A cloud or mist is, in\r\nfact, fine water-dust. Rain is coarse water-dust formed by the\r\naggregation of smaller globules, and varying in fineness from the\r\nScotch mist to the tropical deluge. It has often been asked how it is\r\nthat clouds and mists are able to float about when water is so much\r\nheavier (800 times heavier) than air. The answer to this is easy. It\r\ndepends on the resistance or viscosity of fluids, and on the smallness\r\nof the particles concerned. Bodies falling far through fluids acquire\r\na \"terminal velocity,\" at which they are in stable equilibrium--their\r\nweight being exactly equal to the resistance--and this terminal\r\nvelocity is greater for large particles than for small; consequently\r\nwe have all sorts of rain velocity, depending on the size of the\r\ndrops; and large particles of dust settle more quickly than small.\r\nCloud-spherules are falling therefore, but falling very slowly.\r\n\r\nTo recognize the presence of dust in air there are two principal\r\ntests; the first is, the obvious one of looking at it with plenty of\r\nlight, the way one is accustomed to look for anything else; the other\r\nis a method of Mr. John Aitken's, viz., to observe the condensation of\r\nwater vapor.\r\n\r\nTake these in order. When a sunbeam enters a darkened room through a\r\nchink, it is commonly said to be rendered visible by the motes or dust\r\nparticles dancing in it; but of course really it is not the motes\r\nwhich make the sunbeam visible, but the sunbeam the motes. A dust\r\nparticle is illuminated like any other solid screen, and is able to\r\nsend a sufficient fraction of light to our eyes to render itself\r\nvisible. If there are no such particles in the beam--nothing but\r\nclear, invisible air--then of course nothing is seen, and the beam\r\nplunges on its way quite invisible to us unless we place our eyes in\r\nits course. In other words, to be visible, light must enter the eye.\r\n(A concentrated beam was passed through an empty tube, and then\r\nordinary air let in.)\r\n\r\nThe other test, that of Mr. Aitken, depends on the condensation of\r\nsteam. When a jet of steam finds itself in dusty air, it condenses\r\naround each dust particle as a nucleus, and forms the white visible\r\ncloud popularly called steam. In the absence of nuclei Mr. Aitken has\r\nshown that the steam cannot condense until it is highly\r\nsupersaturated, and that when it does it condenses straight into\r\nrain--that is, into large drops which fall. The condensation of steam\r\nis a more delicate test for dust than is a beam of light. A curious\r\nillustration of the action of nuclei in condensing moisture has just\r\noccurred to me, in the experiment--well known to children--of writing\r\non a reasonably clean window-pane with, say, a blunt wooden point, and\r\nthen breathing on the glass; the condensation of the breath renders\r\nthe writing legible. No doubt the nuclei are partially wiped away by\r\nthe writing, and the moisture will condense into larger drops with\r\nless light-scattering power along the written lines than over the\r\ngeneral surface of the pane where the nuclei are plentiful, and the\r\ndrops therefore numerous and minute. Mr. Aitken points out that if the\r\nair were ever quite dustless, vapor could not condense, but the air\r\nwould gradually get into a horribly supersaturated condition, soaking\r\nall our walls and clothes, dripping from every leaf, and penetrating\r\neverywhere, instead of falling in an honest shower, against which\r\numbrellas and slate roofs are some protection. But let us understand\r\nwhat sort of dust it is which is necessary for this condensing\r\nprocess. It is not the dust and smoke of towns, it is not the dust of\r\na country road; all such particles as these are gross and large\r\ncompared with those which are able to act as condensers of moisture.\r\nThe fine dust of Mr. Aitken exists everywhere, even in the upper\r\nregions of the atmosphere; many of its particles are of\r\nultra-microscopic fineness, one of them must exist in every raindrop,\r\nnay, even in every spherule of a mist or cloud, but it is only\r\noccasionally that one can find them with the microscope. It is to such\r\nparticles as these that we owe the blue of the sky, and yet they are\r\nsufficiently gross and tangible to be capable of being filtered out of\r\nthe air by a packed mass of cotton-wool. Such dust as this, then, we\r\nneed never be afraid of being without. Without it there could be no\r\nrain, and existence would be insupportable, perhaps impossible; but it\r\nis not manufactured in towns; the sea makes it; trees and wind make\r\nit; but the kind of dust made in towns rises only a few hundred yards\r\nor so into the atmosphere, floating as a canopy or pall over those\r\nunfortunate regions, and sinks and settles most of it as soon as the\r\nair is quiet, but scarcely any of it ever rises into the upper regions\r\nof the atmosphere at all.\r\n\r\nDust, then, being so universally prevalent, what do I mean by\r\ndust-free spaces? How are such things possible? And where are they to\r\nbe found? In 1870 Dr. Tyndall was examining dusty air by means of a\r\nbeam of light in which a spirit-lamp happened to be burning, when he\r\nnoticed that from the flame there poured up torrents of apparently\r\nthick black smoke. He could not think the flame was really smoky, but\r\nto make sure he tried, first a Bunsen gas flame and then a hydrogen\r\nflame. They all showed the same effect, and smoke was out of the\r\nquestion. He then used a red-hot poker, a platinum wire ignited by an\r\nelectric current, and ultimately a flask of hot water, and he found\r\nthat from all warm bodies examined in dusty air by a beam of light the\r\nupstreaming convection currents were dark. Now, of course smoke would\r\nbehave very differently. Dusty air itself is only a kind of smoke, and\r\nit looks bright, and the thicker the smoke the brighter it looks; the\r\nblackness is simply the utter absence of smoke; there is nothing at\r\nall for the light to illuminate, accordingly we have the blankness of\r\nsheer invisibility. Here is a flame burning under the beam, and, to\r\nshow what real smoke looks like, I will burn also this spirit lamp\r\nfilled with turpentine instead of alcohol. _Why_ the convention\r\ncurrents were free from dust was unknown; Tyndall thought the dust was\r\nburnt and consumed; Dr. Frankland thought it was simply evaporated.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 Lord Rayleigh took the matter up, not feeling satisfied with\r\nthese explanations, and repeated the experiment very carefully. He\r\nnoted several new points, and hit on the capital idea of seeing what a\r\ncold body did. From the cold body the descending current was just as\r\ndark and dust-free as from a warm body. Combustion and evaporation\r\nexplanations suffered their death-blow. But he was unable to suggest\r\nany other explanation in their room, and so the phenomenon remained\r\ncurious and unexplained.\r\n\r\nIn this state Mr. Clark and I took the matter up last summer, and\r\ncritically examined all sorts of hypotheses that suggested themselves,\r\nMr. Clark following up the phenomena experimentally with great\r\ningenuity and perseverance. One hypothesis after another suggested\r\nitself, seemed hopeful for a time, but ultimately had to be discarded.\r\nSome died quickly, others lingered long. In the examination of one\r\nelectrical hypothesis which suggested itself we came across various\r\ncurious phenomena which we hope still to follow up.[2] It was some\r\nmonths before what we now believe to be the true explanation began to\r\ndawn upon us. Meanwhile we had acquired various new facts, and first\r\nand foremost we found that the dark plane rising from a warm body was\r\nonly the upstreaming portion of a dust-free _coat_ perpetually being\r\nrenewed on the surface of the body. Let me describe the appearance and\r\nmode of seeing it by help of a diagram. (For full description see\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_ for March, 1884.)\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 2: For instance, the electric properties of crystals\r\n   can be readily examined in illuminated dusty air; the dust grows\r\n   on them in little bushes and marks out their poles and neutral\r\n   regions, without any need for an electrometer. Magnesia smoke\r\n   answers capitally.]\r\n\r\nSurrounding all bodies warmer than the air is a thin region free from\r\ndust, which shows itself as a dark space when examined by looking\r\nalong a cylinder illuminated transversely, and with a dark background.\r\nAt high temperatures the coat is thick; at very low temperatures it is\r\nabsent, and dust then rapidly collects on the rod. On a warm surface\r\nonly the heavy particles are able to settle--there is evidently some\r\naction tending to drive small bodies away. An excess of temperature of\r\na degree or two is sufficient to establish this dust-free coat, and it\r\nis easy to see the dust-free plane rising from it. The appearances may\r\nalso be examined by looking along a cylinder _toward_ the source of\r\nlight, when the dust-free spaces will appear brighter than the rest. A\r\nrod of electric light carbon warmed and fixed horizontally across a\r\nbell-jar full of dense smoke is very suitable for this experiment, and\r\nby means of a lens the dust-free regions may be thus projected on to a\r\nscreen. Diminished pressure makes the coat thicker. Increased pressure\r\nmakes it thinner. In hydrogen it is thicker, and in carbonic acid\r\nthinner, than in air. We have also succeeded in observing it in\r\nliquids--for instance, in water holding fine rouge in suspension, the\r\nsolid body being a metal steam tube. Quantitative determinations are\r\nnow in progress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1 and Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows the appearance when looking along a copper or carbon rod\r\nlaterally illuminated; the paths of the dust particles are roughly\r\nindicated. Fig. 2 shows the coat on a semi-cylinder of sheet copper\r\nwith the concave side turned toward the light.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give the full explanation of the dust free spaces\r\nin a few words, but we may say roughly that there is a molecular\r\nbombardment from all warm surfaces by means of which small suspended\r\nbodies get driven outward and kept away from the surface. It is a sort\r\nof differential bombardment of the gas molecules on the two faces of a\r\ndust particle somewhat analogous to the action on Mr. Crookes'\r\nradiometer vanes. Near cold surfaces the bombardment is very feeble,\r\nand if they are cold enough it appears to act toward the body, driving\r\nthe dust inward--at any rate, there is no outward bombardment\r\nsufficient to keep the dust away, and bodies colder than the\r\natmosphere surrounding them soon get dusty. Thus if I hold this piece\r\nof glass in a magnesium flame, or in a turpentine or camphor flame, it\r\nquickly gets covered with smoke--white in the one case, black in the\r\nother. I take two conical flasks with their surfaces blackened with\r\ncamphor black, and filling one with ice, the other with boiling water,\r\nI cork them and put a bell jar over them, under which I burn some\r\nmagnesium wire; in a quarter of an hour or so we find that the cold\r\none is white and hoary, the hot one has only a few larger specks of\r\ndust on it, these being of such size that the bombardment was unable\r\nto sustain their weight, and they have settled by gravitation. We thus\r\nsee that when the air in a room is warmer than the solids in it--as\r\nwill be the case when stoves, gas-burners, etc., are used--things will\r\nget very dusty; whereas when walls and objects are warmer than the\r\nair--as will be the case in sunshine, or when open fireplaces are\r\nused, things will tend to keep themselves more free from dust. Mr.\r\nAitken points out that soot in a chimney is an illustration of this\r\nkind of deposition of dust; and as another illustration it strikes me\r\nas just possible that the dirtiness of snow during a thaw may be\r\npartly due to the bombardment on to the cold surface of dust out of\r\nthe warmer air above. Mr. Aitken has indeed suggested a sort of\r\npractical dust or smoke filter on this principle, passing air between\r\ntwo surfaces--one hot and one cold--so as to vigorously bombard the\r\nparticles on to the cold surface and leave the air free.\r\n\r\nBut we have found another and apparently much more effectual mode of\r\nclearing air than this. We do it by discharging electricity into it.\r\nIt is easily possible to electrify air by means of a point or flame,\r\nand an electrified body has this curious property, that the dust near\r\nit at once aggregates together into larger particles. It is not\r\ndifficult to understand why this happens; each of the particles\r\nbecomes polarized by induction, and they then cling together end to\r\nend, just like iron filings near a magnet. A feeble charge is often\r\nsufficient to start this coagulating action. And when the particles\r\nhave grown into big ones, they easily and quickly fall. A stronger\r\ncharge forcibly drives them on to all electrified surfaces, where they\r\ncling. A fine water fog in a bell jar, electrified, turns first into a\r\ncoarse fog or Scotch mist, and then into rain. Smoke also has its\r\nparticles coagulated, and a space can thus be cleared of it. I will\r\nillustrate this action by making some artificial fogs in a bell-jar\r\nfurnished with a metal point. First burn some magnesium wire,\r\nelectrify it by a few turns of this small Voss machine, and the smoke\r\nhas become snow; the particles are elongated, and by pointing to the\r\ncharged rod indicate the lines of electrostatic force very\r\nbeautifully; electrify further, and the air is perfectly clear. Next\r\nburn turpentine, and electrify gently; the dense black smoke\r\ncoagulates into black masses over an inch long; electrify further, and\r\nthe glass is covered with soot, but the air is clear. Turpentine smoke\r\nacts very well, and can be tried on a larger scale; a room filled with\r\nturpentine smoke, so dense that a gas-light is invisible inside it,\r\nbegins to clear in a minute or two after the machine begins to turn,\r\nand in a quarter of an hour one can go in and find the walls thickly\r\ncovered with stringy blacks, notably on the gas-pipes and everything\r\nmost easily charged by induction. Next fill a bell-jar full of steam,\r\nand electrify, paying attention to insulation of the supply point in\r\nthis case. In a few seconds the air looks clear, and turning on a beam\r\nof light we see the globules of water dancing about, no longer fine\r\nand impalpable, but separately visible and rapidly falling. Finally,\r\nmake a London fog by burning turpentine and sulphur, adding a little\r\nsulphuric acid, either directly as vapor or indirectly by a trace of\r\nnitric oxide, and then blowing in steam. Electrify, and it soon\r\nbecomes clear, although it lakes a little longer than before; and on\r\nremoving the bell-jar we find that even the smell of SO2 has\r\ndisappeared, and only a little vapor of turpentine remains. Similarly\r\nwe can make a Widnes fog by sulphureted hydrogen, chlorine, sulphuric\r\nacid, and a little steam. Probably the steam assists the clearing when\r\ngases have to be dealt with. It may be possible to clear the air of\r\ntunnels by simply discharging electricity into the air--the\r\nelectricity being supplied by Holtz machines, driven say by small\r\nturbines--a very handy form of power, difficult to get out of order.\r\nOr possibly some hydro-electric arrangement might be devised for the\r\nlocomotive steam to do the work. I even hope to make some impression\r\non a London fog, discharging from lightning conductors or captive\r\nballoons carrying flames, but it is premature to say anything about\r\nthis matter yet. I have, however, cleared a room of smoke very quickly\r\nwith a small hand machine.\r\n\r\nIt will naturally strike you how closely allied these phenomena must\r\nbe to the fact of popular science that \"thunder clears the air.\" Ozone\r\nis undoubtedly generated by the flashes, and may have a beneficial\r\neffect, but the dust-coagulating and dust-expelling power of the\r\nelectricity has a much more rapid effect, though it may not act till\r\nthe cloud is discharged. Consider a cloud electrified slightly; the\r\nmists and clouds in its vicinity begin to coagulate, and go on till\r\nlarge drops are formed, which may be held up by electrical action, the\r\ndrops dancing from one cloud to another and thus forming the very\r\ndense thunder cloud. The coagulation of charged drops increases the\r\npotential, as Prof. Tait points out, until at length--flash--the cloud\r\nis discharged, and the large drops fall in a violent shower. Moreover,\r\nthe rapid excursion to and fro of the drops may easily have caused\r\nthem to evaporate so fast as to freeze, and hence we may get hail.\r\n\r\nWhile the cloud was electrified, it acted inductively on the earth\r\nunderneath, drawing up an opposite charge from all points, and thus\r\nelectrifying the atmosphere. When the discharge occurs this\r\natmospheric electrification engages with the earth, clearing the air\r\nbetween, and driving the dust and germs on to all exposed surfaces. In\r\nsome such way also it may be that \"thunder turns milk sour,\" and\r\nexerts other putrefactive influences on the bodies which receive the\r\ngerms and dust from the air.\r\n\r\nBut we are now no longer on safe and thoroughly explored territory. I\r\nhave allowed myself to found upon a basis of experimental fact, a\r\nsuperstructure of practical application to the explanation of the\r\nphenomena of nature and to the uses of man. The basis seems to me\r\nstrong enough to bear most of the superstructure, but before being\r\nsure it will be necessary actually to put the methods into operation\r\nand to experiment on a very large scale. I hope to do this when I can\r\nget to a suitable place of operation. Liverpool fogs are poor affairs,\r\nand not worth clearing off. Manchester fogs are much better and more\r\nfrequent, but there is nothing to beat the real article as found in\r\nLondon, and in London if possible I intend to rig up some large\r\nmachines and to see what happens. The underground railway also offers\r\nits suffocating murkiness as a most tempting field for experiment, and\r\nI wish I were able already to tell you the actual result instead of\r\nbeing only in a position to indicate possibilities. Whether anything\r\ncomes of it practically or not, it is an instructive example of how\r\nthe smallest and most unpromising beginnings may, if only followed up\r\nlong enough, lead to suggestions for large practical application. When\r\nwe began the investigation into the dust-free spaces found above warm\r\nbodies, we were not only without expectation, but without hope or idea\r\nof any sort, that anything was likely to come of it; the phenomenon\r\nitself possessed its own interest and charm.\r\n\r\nAnd so it must ever be. The devotee of pure science never has\r\npractical developments as his primary aim; often he not only does not\r\nknow, but does not in the least care whether his researches will ever\r\nlead to any beneficial result. In some minds this passive ignoring of\r\nthe practical goes so far as to become active repulsion; so that some\r\nsingularly biased minds will not engage in anything which seems likely\r\nto lead to practical use. I regard this as an error, and as the sign\r\nof a warped judgment, for after all man is to us the most important\r\npart of nature; but the system works well nevertheless, and the\r\ndivision of labor accomplishes its object. One man investigates nature\r\nimpelled simply by his own genius, and because he feels he cannot help\r\nit; it never occurs to him to give a reason for or to justify his\r\npursuits. Another subsequently utilizes his results, and applies them\r\nto the benefit of the race. Meanwhile, however, it may happen that the\r\nyet unapplied and unfruitful results evoke a sneer, and the question:\r\n\"Cui bono?\" the only answer to which question seems to be: \"No one is\r\nwise enough to tell beforehand what gigantic developments may not\r\nspring from the most insignificant fact.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEPHONY AND TELEGRAPHY ON THE SAME WIRES SIMULTANEOUSLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the last eighteen months a system has been in active operation in\r\nBelgium whereby the ordinary telegraph wires are used to convey\r\ntelephonic communications at the same time that they are being\r\nemployed in their ordinary work of transmitting telegraphic messages.\r\nThis system, the invention of M. Van Rysselberghe, whose previous\r\ndevices for diminishing the evil effects of induction in the telephone\r\nservice will be remembered, has lately been described in the _Journal\r\nTelegraphique_ of Berne, by M.J. Banneux of the Belgian Telegraph\r\nDepartment. Our information is derived from this article and from\r\nothers by M. Hospitalier.\r\n\r\nThe method previously adopted by Van Rysselberghe, to prevent\r\ninduction from taking place between the telegraph wires and those\r\nrunning parallel to them used for telephone work, was briefly as\r\nfollows: The system of sending the dots and dashes of the\r\ncode--usually done by depressing and raising a key which suddenly\r\nturns on the current and then suddenly turns it off--was modified so\r\nthat the current should rise gradually and fall gradually in its\r\nstrength by the introduction of suitable resistances. These were\r\nintroduced into the circuit at the moment of closing or opening by a\r\nsimple automatic arrangement worked exactly as before by a key. The\r\nresult, of the gradual opening and gradual closing of the circuit was\r\nthat the current attained its full strength gradually instead of\r\nsuddenly, and died away also gradually. And as induction from one wire\r\nto another depends not on the strength of the current, but on the rate\r\nat which the strength changes, this very simple modification had the\r\neffect of suppressing induction. Later Van Rysselberghe changed these\r\narrangements for the still simpler device of introducing permanently\r\ninto the circuit either condensers or else electro-magnets having a\r\nhigh coefficient of self-induction. These, as is well known to all\r\ntelegraphic engineers, retard the rise or fall of an electric current;\r\nthey fulfill the conditions required for the working of Van\r\nRysselberghe's method better than any other device.\r\n\r\nHaving got thus far in his devices for destroying induction from one\r\nline to another, Van Rysselberghe saw that, as an immediate\r\nconsequence, it might be concluded that, if the telegraph currents\r\nwere thus modified and graduated so that they produced no induction in\r\na neighboring telephone line, they would produce no sound in the\r\ntelephone if that instrument were itself joined up in the telegraph\r\nline. And such was found to be case. Why this is so will be more\r\nreadily comprehended if it be remembered that a telephone is sensitive\r\nto the changes in the strength of the current if those changes occur\r\nwith a frequency of some hundreds or in some cases thousands of times\r\n_per second_. On the other hand, currents vibrating with such rapidity\r\nas this are utterly incompetent to affect the moving parts of\r\ntelegraphic instruments, which cannot at the most be worked so as to\r\ngive more than 200 to 800 separate signals _per minute_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nThe simplest arrangement for carrying out this method is shown in Fig.\r\n1, which illustrates the arrangements at one end of a line. M is the\r\nMorse key for sending messages, and is shown as in its position of\r\nrest for receiving. The currents arriving from the line pass first\r\nthrough a \"graduating\" electromagnet, E2, of about 500 ohms\r\nresistance, then through the key, thence through the electromagnet, R,\r\nof the receiving Morse instrument, and so to the earth. A condenser,\r\nC, of 2 microfarads capacity is also introduced between the key and\r\nearth. There is a second \"graduating\" electromagnet, E1, of 500 ohms\r\nresistance introduced between the sending battery, B, and the key.\r\nWhen the key, M, is depressed in order to send a signal, the current\r\nfrom the battery must charge the condenser, C, and must magnetize the\r\ncores of the two electromagnets, E1 and E2, and is thereby retarded in\r\nrising to its full strength. Consequently no sound is heard in a\r\ntelephone, T, inserted in the line-circuit. Neither the currents which\r\nstart from one end nor those which start from the other will affect\r\nthe telephones inserted in the line. And, if these currents do not\r\naffect telephones in the actual line, it is clear that they will not\r\naffect telephones in neighboring lines. Also the telephones so\r\ninserted in the main line might be used for speaking to one another,\r\nthough the arrangement of the telephones in the same actual line would\r\nbe inconvenient. Accordingly M. Van Rysselberghe has devised a further\r\nmodification in which a separate branch taken from the telegraph line\r\nis made available for the telephone service. To understand this\r\nmatter, one other fact must be explained. Telephonic conversation can\r\nbe carried on, even though the actual metallic communication be\r\nsevered by the insertion of a condenser. Indeed, in quite the early\r\ndays of the Bell telephone, an operator in the States used a condenser\r\nin the telegraph line to enable him to talk through the wire. If a\r\ntelephonic set at T1 (Fig. 2) communicate through the line to a\r\ndistant station, T2, through a condenser, C, of a capacity of half a\r\nmicrofarad, conversation is still perfectly audible, provided the\r\ntelephonic system is one that acts by induction currents. And since in\r\nthis case the interposition of the condenser prevents any continuous\r\nflow of current through the line, no perceptible weakening will be\r\nfelt if a shunt S, of as high a resistance as 500 ohms and of great\r\nelectromagnetic rigidity, that is to say, having a high coefficient of\r\nself-induction, be placed across the circuit from line to earth. In\r\nthis, as well as in the other figures, the telephones indicated are of\r\nthe Bell pattern, and if set up as shown in Fig. 2, without any\r\nbattery, would be used both as transmitter and receiver on Bell's\r\noriginal plan. But as a matter of fact any ordinary telephone might be\r\nused. In practice the Bell telephone is not advantageous as a\r\ntransmitter, and has been abandoned except for receiving; the Blake,\r\nAder, or some other modification of the microphone being used in\r\nconjunction with a separate battery. To avoid complication in the\r\ndrawings, however, the simplest case is taken. And it must be\r\nunderstood that instead of the single instrument shown at T1 or T2, a\r\ncomplete set of telephonic instruments, including transmitter,\r\nbattery, induction-coil, and receiver or receivers, may be\r\nsubstituted. And if a shunt, S, of 500 ohms placed across the circuit\r\nmakes no difference to the talking in the telephones because of the\r\ninterposition of the separating condenser, C, it will readily be\r\nunderstood that a telegraphic system properly \"graduated,\" and having\r\nalso a resistance of 500 ohms, will not affect the telephones if\r\ninterposed in the place of S. This arrangement is shown in Fig. 3,\r\nwhere the \"graduated\" telegraph-set from Fig. 1 is intercalated into\r\nthe telephonic system of Fig. 2, so that both work simultaneously, but\r\nindependently, through a single line. The combined system at each end\r\nof the line will then consist of the telephone-set, T1, the telegraph\r\ninstruments (comprising battery, B1, key, M1 and Morse receiver, R1),\r\nthe \"graduating\" electromagnets, E1, and E2, the \"graduating\"\r\ncondenser, C1, and the \"separating\" condenser, C2. It was found by\r\nactual experiments that the same arrangement was good for lines\r\nvarying from 28 to 200 miles in length. A single wire between\r\nBrussels, Ghent, and Ostend is now regularly employed for transmission\r\nby telegraph of the ordinary messages and of the telemeteorographic\r\nsignals between the two observatories at those places, and by\r\ntelephone of verbal simultaneous correspondence, for one of the Ghent\r\nnewspapers. A still more interesting arrangement is possible, and is\r\nindicated in Fig. 4. Here a separating condenser is introduced at the\r\nintermediate station at Ghent between earth and the line, which is\r\nthereby cut into two independent sections for telephonic purposes,\r\nwhile remaining for telegraphic purposes a single undivided line\r\nbetween Brussels and Ostend. Brussels can telegraph to Ostend, or\r\nOstend to Brussels, and at the same time the wire can be used to\r\ntelephone between Ghent and Ostend, or between Ghent and Brussels, or\r\nboth sections may be simultaneously used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\r\n\r\nIt would appear, then, that M. Van Rysselberghe has made an advance of\r\nvery extraordinary merit in devising these combinations. We have seen\r\nin recent years how duplex telegraphy superseded single working, only\r\nto be in turn superseded by the quadruplex system. Multiplex\r\ntelegraphy of various kinds has been actively pursued, but chiefly on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic rather than in this country, where our\r\nfast-speed automatic system has proved quite adequate hitherto.\r\nWhether we shall see the adoption in the United Kingdom of Van\r\nRysselberghe's system is, however, by no means certain. The essence of\r\nit consists in retarding the telegraphic signals to a degree quite\r\nincompatible with the fast-speed automatic transmission of telegraphic\r\nmessages in which our Post Office system excels. We are not likely to\r\nspoil our telegraphic system for the sake of simultaneous telephony,\r\nunless there is something to be gained of much greater advantage than\r\nas yet appears.--_Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC MARIGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor registering the height of the tide at every instant, hydrographic\r\nservices generally adopt quite a simple marigraph. The apparatus\r\nconsists in principle of a counterpoised float whose rising and\r\nfalling motion, reduced to a tenth, by means of a system of toothed\r\nwheels, is transmitted to a pencil which moves in front of a vertical\r\ncylinder. This cylinder itself moves around its axis by means of a\r\nclockwork mechanism, and accomplishes one entire revolution every\r\ntwenty-four hours. By this means is obtained a curve of the tide in\r\nwhich the times are taken for abscisses and the heights of the sea for\r\nordinates. However little such marigraphs have had to be used, great\r\ndefects have been recognized in them. When we come to change the sheet\r\non the cylinder (and such change should be made at least once every\r\nfifteen days), there is an interruption in the curve. It is necessary,\r\nbesides, to perform office work of the most detailed kind in order to\r\nrefer to the same origin all these curves, which are intercrossed and\r\noften superposed in certain parts upon the original sheet. In order to\r\nrender such a disentanglement possible, it is indispensable to mark by\r\nhand, at least once every twenty-four hours, upon each curve, the date\r\nof the day corresponding to it. It is equally useful to verify the\r\nexactness of the indications given by the apparatus by making readings\r\nseveral times a day on a scale of tides placed alongside of the float.\r\nNine times out of ten the rise of the waves renders such readings very\r\ndifficult and the control absolutely illusory.\r\n\r\nAll these conditions united, as well as others that we neglect in this\r\nbrief discussion, necessitate a surveillance at every instant. The\r\nresult is that these marigraphs must be installed in a special\r\nstructure, very near the bank, so as to be reachable at all times, and\r\nthat the indications that they give are always vitiated by error,\r\nsince the operation is performed upon a level at which are exerted\r\ndisturbing influences that are not found at a kilometer at sea. It\r\nwere to be desired that the float could be isolated by placing it a\r\ncertain distance from the shore, and transmit its indications, by\r\nmeant of a play of currents, to a registering apparatus situated upon\r\n_terra firma_.\r\n\r\nIn the course of one of his lectures published in the December number\r\n(1883) of the _Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift_, Mr. Von Hefner-Alteneck\r\ntells us that such a desideratum has been supplied by the firm of\r\nSiemens & Halske. This marigraph, constructed on an order of the\r\nGerman Admiralty, gives the level of the sea every ten minutes with an\r\napproximation of 0.12 per cent., and that too for a difference of 8\r\nmeters between the highest and lowest sea. The apparatus consists, as\r\nwe said above, of a float and registering device, connected with each\r\nother by means of a cable. This latter is formed of three ordinary\r\nconductors covered with gutta percha and surrounded with a leaden\r\nsheath, which latter is itself protected against accident by means of\r\na strong covering of iron wire and hemp. The return is effected\r\nthrough the earth. We shall enter into details concerning each of\r\nthese two apparatus in-succession, by beginning with the float, of\r\nwhich Fig. 1 gives a general view, and Fig. 2 a diagrammatic sketch.\r\nThe float moves in a cast iron cylinder, having at its lower part a\r\nlarge number of apertures of small diameter, so that the motion of the\r\nwaves does not perceptibly influence the level of the water in the\r\ninterior of the cylinder. It is attached to a copper ribbon, B, whose\r\nother extremity is fixed to the drum, T. The ribbon winds around the\r\nlatter in the rising motion of the float, owing to a spiral spring\r\narranged so as to act upon the drum. The tension of this spring goes\r\non increasing in measure as the float descends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--FLOAT OF SIEMENS AND HALSKE'S MARIGRAPH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThis difference in tension is utilized for balancing at every instant\r\nthe weight of the ribbon unwound, and thus causing the float to\r\nimmerse itself in the water to a constant degree. The ribbon, B, is\r\nprovided throughout its length with equidistant apertures that exactly\r\ncorrespond to tappets that project from the circumference of the\r\nwheel, R. When the float moves its position, the wheel, R, begins to\r\nturn and carries along in doing so the pinion, w, which revolves\r\nover the toothed wheels, s1, s2, and s3. The thickness of w\r\nis equal to that of the three wheels, s1, s2, and s3, and a\r\nspecial spring secures at every instant an intimate contact between\r\nthe pinion and the said wheels. These latter are insulated from each\r\nother and from the axle upon which they are keyed, and communicate,\r\neach of them, with conductors, I., II., and III. They are so formed\r\nand mounted that, in each of them, the tooth in one corresponds to the\r\ninterspace in the two others. As a result of this, in the motion of\r\nthe pinion, w, the latter is never in contact with but one of the\r\nthree wheels, s1, s2, and s3.\r\n\r\nIf we add that the lines, I., II., and III. are united at the shore\r\nstation with one of the poles of a pile whose other pole is connected\r\nwith the earth, and that w communicates with the earth through the\r\nintermedium of R, and the body of the apparatus, it is easy to see\r\nthat in a vertical motion of the float in one direction we shall have\r\ncurrents succeeding each other in the order I., II., III., I., II.,\r\netc., while the order will become III., II., I., III., II., etc., if\r\nthe direction of the float's motion happen to change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how a variation in currents of this kind can be\r\napplied in general for producing a rotary motion in the two\r\ndirections, it will only be necessary to refer to Figs. 3 and 4. The\r\nconductors, L1, L2, and L3 communicate with the bobbins of\r\nthree electromagnets, E1, E2, and E3, whose poles are bent at\r\nright angles to the circumference of the wheel, R. There is never but\r\none pole opposite a tooth. The distance between two consecutive poles\r\nmust be equal to a multiple of the pitch increased (Fig. 3) or\r\ndiminished (Fig. 4) by one-third thereof. It will be seen upon a\r\nsimple inspection of the figures that R will revolve in the direction\r\nof the hands of a watch when the currents follow the order L1,\r\nL2, L3, etc., in the case shown in Fig. 3, while in the case\r\nshown in Fig. 4 the rotary motion will be in the contrary direction\r\nfor this same order of currents. But, in both cases, and this is the\r\nimportant point, the direction of rotation changes when the order in\r\nthe succession of currents; is inverted. Fig. 6 gives a perspective\r\nview of the registering apparatus, and Fig. 5 represents it in\r\ndiagram. It will be at once seen that, the toothed wheel, r, is\r\nreduced to its simplest expression, since it consists of two teeth\r\nonly. The electro-magnets are arranged at an angle of 120°, and for a\r\nchange of current the wheel, r, describes an angle of 60°, that is\r\nto say, a sixth of a circumference. The motion of r is transmitted, by\r\nmeans of the pinion, d, and the wheel, e, to the wheel, T. For a\r\none-meter variation in level the wheel, T, makes one complete\r\nrevolution. It is divided into 100 equal parts, and each arc therefore\r\ncorresponds to a difference of one centimeter in the level, and\r\ncarries, engraved in projection, the corresponding number. As a\r\nconsequence, there is upon the entire circumference a series of\r\nnumbers from to 99. The axle upon which the wheel, T, is keyed is\r\nprolonged, on the side opposite e, by a threaded part, a, which\r\nactuates a stylet, g. This latter is held above by a rod, I, which\r\nis connected with a fork movable around a vertical axis, shown in Fig.\r\n6. The rectilinear motion of g is 5 mm. for a variation of one meter\r\nin level. Its total travel is consequently 40 mm. The sheet of paper\r\nupon which the indications are taken, and which is shown of actual\r\nsize in Fig. 7, winds around the drum, P, and receives its motion from\r\nthe cylinder, W. This sheet is covered throughout its length with fine\r\nprepared paper that permits of taking the imprints by impression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6--RECEIVER OF SIEMENS AND HALSKE'S MARIGRAPH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7]\r\n\r\nThis stated, the play of the apparatus may be easily understood. Every\r\nten minutes a regulating clock closes the circuit of the local pile,\r\nB2, and establishes a contact at C. The electro-magnet, E4,\r\nattracts its armature, and thus acts upon the lever, h, which\r\npresses the sheet of paper against the stylet in front that serves to\r\nmark the level of the lowest waters, and against the stylet, g, and\r\nthe wheels, T and Z. In falling back, the lever, h, causes the\r\nadvance, by one notch, of the ratchet wheel that is mounted at the\r\nextremity of the cylinder W, and thus displaces the sheet of paper a\r\ndistance of 5 mm. The wheel, Z, carries engraved in projection upon\r\nits circumference the hours in Roman figures, and moves forward one\r\ndivision every 60 minutes. The motion of this wheel is likewise\r\ncontrolled by the cylinder, W.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen upon referring to Fig. 7, that there is obtained a\r\nvery sharp curve marked by points. We have a general view on\r\nconsidering the curve itself, and the height in meters is read\r\ndirectly. The fractions of a meter, as well as the times, are in the\r\nmargin. Thus, at the point, a, the apparatus gives at 3 o'clock and\r\n20 minutes a height of tide of 4.28 m. above the level of the lowest\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus might possibly operate well, and yet not be in accord\r\nwith the real indications of the float, so it has been judged\r\nnecessary to add to it the following control.\r\n\r\nEvery time the float reaches 3 meters above the level of the lowest\r\ntide, the circuit of one of the lines that is open at this moment\r\n(that of line I, for example) closes at C (Fig. 2), into this new\r\ncircuit there is interposed a considerable resistance, W, so that the\r\nenergy of the current is weakened to such a point that it in nowise\r\ninfluences the normal travel of the wheel, r. At the shore station,\r\nthere is placed in deviation a galvanoscope, K, whose needle is\r\ndeflected. It suffices, then, to take datum points upon the\r\nregistering apparatus, upon the wheel, T, and the screw, a, in such\r\na way as to ascertain the moment at which the stylet, g, is going to\r\nmark 3 meters. At this moment the circuit of the galvanoscope, K, is\r\nclosed, and we ascertain whether there is a deviation of the needle.\r\n\r\nAs the sea generally rises to the height of 3 meters twice a day, it\r\nis possible to control the apparatus twice a day, and this is fully\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nIt always belongs to practice to judge of an invention. Mr. Von\r\nHefner-Alteneck tells us that two of these apparatus have been set\r\nup--one of them a year ago in the port of Kiel, and the other more\r\nrecently at the Isle of Wangeroog in the North Sea--and that both have\r\nbehaved excellently since the very first day of their installation. We\r\nshall add nothing to this, since it is evidently the best eulogium\r\nthat can be accorded them.--_La Lumiere Electrique._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDELUNE & CO.'S SYSTEM OF LAYING UNDERGROUND CABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent times considerable attention has been paid to the subject of\r\nlaying telegraph cables underground, and various methods have been\r\ndevised. In some cases the cables have been covered with an armor of\r\niron, and in others they have been inclosed in cast-iron pipes. For\r\ntelephonic service they are generally inclosed in leaden tubes. What\r\nthis external envelope shall be that is to protect the wires from\r\ninjury is a question of the highest importance, since not only the\r\nsubject of protection is concerned, but also that of cost. It is\r\ntherefore interesting to note the efforts that are being made in this\r\nline of electric industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Section of the Pipe Open.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Section of the Pipe Closed.]\r\n\r\nMessrs. Delune & Co. have recently taken out a patent for an\r\narrangement consisting of pipes made of beton. The annexed cuts,\r\nborrowed from _L'Electricite_, represent this new system. The pipes,\r\nwhich are provided with a longitudinal opening, are placed end to end\r\nand coupled with a cement sleeve. The cables are put in place by\r\nsimply unwinding them as the work proceeds, and thus all that traction\r\nis done away with that they are submitted to when cast iron pipes are\r\nused. When once the cables are in place the longitudinal opening is\r\nstopped up with cement mortar, and in this way a very tight conduit is\r\nobtained whose hardness increases with time. The value of the system\r\ntherefore depends, as in all cement work, on the care with which the\r\nmanufacturing is done.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made with the system at Toulouse, by the\r\nMinister of Post Offices and Telegraphs, and at Lyons, by the General\r\nSociety of Telephones. Here, as with all similar questions, no opinion\r\ncan be pronounced until after a prolonged experience. But we cannot\r\nhelp setting forth the advantages that the system offers. These are,\r\nin the first place, a saving of about 50 per cent. over iron pipe, and\r\nin the second, a better insulation, and consequently a better\r\nprotection of the currents against all kinds of disturbance, since a\r\nnon-conducting mass of cement is here substituted for metal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY APPLIED TO HORSE-SHOEING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing new but what has been forgotten,\" said Marie\r\nAntoinette to her milliner, Mdlle. Bertin, and what is true of fashion\r\nis also somewhat so of science. Shoeing restive horses by the aid of\r\nelectricity is not new, experiments thereon having been performed as\r\nlong ago as 1879 by Mr. Defoy, who operated with a small magneto\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nBut the two photographs reproduced in Figs. 1 and 2 have appeared to\r\nus curious enough to be submitted to our readers, as illustrating Mr.\r\nDefoy's method of operating with an unruly animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE HORSE RECEIVING THE CURRENT.]\r\n\r\nThe battery used was a small Grenet bichromate of potash pile, which\r\nwas easy to graduate on account of the depth to which the zinc could\r\nbe immersed. This pile was connected with the inductor of a small\r\nRuhmkorff coil, whose armature was connected with a snaffle-bit placed\r\nin the horse's mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE HORSE CONQUERED.]\r\n\r\nThis bit was arranged as follows (Fig. 3): The two conductors, which\r\nwere uncovered for a length of about three centimeters at their\r\nextremity, were placed opposite each other on the two joints of the\r\nsnaffle, and about five or six centimeters apart. The mouth-pieces of\r\nthe bit had previously been inclosed in a piece of rubber tubing, in\r\norder to insulate the extremities of the conductors and permit the\r\nrecomposition of the current to take place through the animal's tongue\r\nor palate.\r\n\r\nEach of the bare ends of the conductors was provided, under a circular\r\nbrass ligature, with a small damp sponge, which, surrounding the\r\nmouth-piece, secured a perfect contact of each end of the circuit with\r\nthe horse's mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--ARRANGEMENT OF THE BIT]\r\n\r\nThe horse having been led in, defended himself vigorously as long as\r\nan endeavor was made to remove his shoes by the ordinary method, but\r\nthe current had acted scarcely fifteen seconds when it became possible\r\nto lift his feet and strike his shoes with the hammer.\r\n\r\nThe experimenter having taken care during this experiment to place the\r\nbobbin quite near the horse's ear, so that he could hear the humming\r\nof the interrupter, undertook a second experiment in the following\r\nway: Having detached the conductors from the armature, he placed\r\nhimself in front of the horse (as shown in Fig. 2), and began to\r\nimitate the humming sound of the interrupter with his mouth. The\r\nanimal at once assumed the stupefied position that the action of the\r\ncurrent gave him in the first experiment, and allowed his feet to be\r\nlifted and shod without his even being held by the snaffle.\r\n\r\nThe horse was for ever after subdued, and yet his viciousness and his\r\nrepugnance to shoeing were such that he could only be shod previously\r\nby confining his legs with a kicking-strap.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the action of the induction coil, mounted as\r\nthis was, was very feeble and not very painful; and yet it was very\r\ndisagreeable in the mouth, and gave in this case a shock with a\r\nsensation of light before the eyes, as we have found by experimenting\r\nupon ourselves.\r\n\r\nFrom our own most recent experiments, we have ascertained the\r\nfollowing facts, which may guide every horse-owner in the application\r\nof electricity to an animal that is opposed to being shod: (1) To a\r\nhorse that defends himself because he is irritable by temperament, and\r\nnervous and impressionable (as happens with animals of pure or nearly\r\npure blood), the shock must be administered feebly and gradually\r\nbefore an endeavor is made to take hold of his leg. The horse will\r\nthen make a jump, and try to roll over. The jump must be followed,\r\nwhile an assistant holds the bridle, and the action of the current\r\nmust be at once arrested. After this the horse will not endeavor to\r\ndefend himself, and his leg may be easily handled.\r\n\r\n(2) Certain large, heavy, naturally ugly horses kick through sheer\r\nviciousness. In this case, while the current is being given it should\r\nbe gradually increased in intensity, and the horse's foot must be\r\nseized during its action. In most cases the passage of a current\r\nthrough such horses (whose mucous membrane is less sensitive) produces\r\nonly a slightly stupefied and contracted position of the head,\r\naccompanied with a slight tremor. The current must be shut off as soon\r\nas the horse's foot is well in one's hand, and be at once renewed if\r\nhe endeavors to defend himself again, as is rarely the case. It is a\r\nmare of this nature that is represented in the annexed figures.\r\n\r\nWe know that this same system has been applied for bringing to an\r\nabrupt standstill runaway horses, harnessed to vehicles; but knowing\r\nthe effect of a sudden stoppage under such circumstances, we believe\r\nthat the remedy would prove worse than the disease, since the coachman\r\nand vehicle, in obedience to the laws of inertia, would continue their\r\nmotion and pass over the animals, much to their detriment.--_Science\r\net Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESTEVE'S AUTOMATIC PILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Esteve has recently devised a generator of electricity which he\r\nclaims to be energetic, constant, and always ready to operate. The\r\napparatus is designed for the production of light and for actuating\r\nelectric motors, large induction bobbins, etc.\r\n\r\nWe give a description of it herewith from data communicated by its\r\ninventor.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cut represents a battery of 6 elements, with a\r\nreservoir, R, for the liquid, provided at its lower part with a cock\r\nfor allowing the liquid to enter the pile. The vessels of the\r\ndifferent elements are of rectangular form. At the upper part, and in\r\nthe wider surfaces of each, there are two tubes. The first tube of the\r\nfirst vessel receives the extremity of a safety-tube, A, whose other\r\nextremity enters the upper part of the reservoir, R. This tube is\r\ndesigned for regulating the flow of the liquid into the pile. When the\r\ncock, r, is too widely open, the liquid might have a tendency to\r\nflow over the edges of the vessel; but this would close the orifice of\r\nthe tube, A, and, as the air would then no longer enter the reservoir,\r\nR, the flow would be stopped automatically. The second tube of the\r\nfirst vessel is connected with a lead tube, 1, one of the extremities\r\nof which enters the second vessel. The other tubes are arranged in the\r\nsame way in the other vessels. The renewal of the liquids is effected\r\nby displacement, in flowing upward from one element over into another;\r\nand the liquids make their exit from the pile at D, after having\r\nserved six times. The electrodes of the two first elements are\r\nrepresented as renewed in the cut, in order to show the arrangement of\r\nthe tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESTEVE'S AUTOMATIC PILE.]\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--The zinc, 2, has a superficies of 15×20 centimeters,\r\nand is cut out of the ordinary commercial sheet metal. It may be\r\nturned upside down when one end has become worn away, thus permitting\r\nof its being entirely utilized. The negative electrode is formed of\r\nfour carbons, which have, each of them, a superficies of 8×21\r\ncentimeters. These four carbons are less fragile and are more easily\r\nhandled than two having the same surface. Their arrangement is shown\r\nat the left of the figure. They are fixed to a strip of copper, a,\r\nto which is soldered another strip, L, bent at right angles. There are\r\nthus two pairs of carbon per element, and these are simply suspended\r\nfrom a piece of wood, as shown in the figure. Upon this wooden holder\r\nwill be seen the two strips, LL, that are designed to be put in\r\ncontact with the zinc of the succeeding element by means of pinchers\r\nthat connect the electrodes with one another. This arrangement permits\r\nthe pile to be taken apart very quickly.\r\n\r\n_Charging, Work, and Duration of the Pile._--The inventor has made a\r\nlarge number of experiments with solutions of bichromate of potash of\r\nvarious degrees of saturation, and has found the following to give the\r\nbest results:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Bichromate of potash.           1 kilogramme.\r\n     Sulphuric acid                  2 liters.\r\n     Water                           8    \"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a larger quantity of the salt is used, crystallization occurs in\r\nthe pile.\r\n\r\n                          Constants and work    Constants and work\r\n                          of an element         of a round Bunsen\r\n                          having a zinc of      element, 20×30 cm.\r\n                          16×20 cm.\r\n\r\n  Volts.                       1.9                   1.8\r\n  Resistance.                  0.05                  0.24\r\n  Work disposable in the\r\n  external circuit.           1.839 k.              0.344 k.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work disposable in the external circuit is deduced from the\r\nformula:\r\n\r\n                 T = E²/(4R × 9.81)\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that an element thus charged gives as much energy as\r\n5.3 large Bunsen elements.\r\n\r\nThe battery is charged with 10 liters of solution, and is capable of\r\nfurnishing for 5 hours a current of 7 amperes with a difference of\r\npotential of 9 volts at the pile terminals. The work, according to the\r\nformula (EI)/g, equals 6.422 kilogram-meters; with a feebler\r\nresistance in the external circuit it is capable of producing a\r\ncurrent of 19 amperes for an hour and an half. In this case the\r\nresistance of the external circuit equals the interior resistance of\r\nthe pile. Upon immersing the electrodes in new liquid, and with no\r\nresistance in the external circuit, the current may reach 100 amperes.\r\nOn renewing the liquids during the operation of the pile, a current of\r\n7 amperes is kept up if about a liter of saturation per hour be\r\nallowed to pass into the battery.

The hydrogen, in diffusing, enters the porous vessel, increases\r\nthe internal pressure, and a number of bubbles escapes from the tube.\r\nOn withdrawing the bell glass of hydrogen, the latter becomes diffused\r\nexternally, a lower pressure occurs in the porous vessel, and the\r\nlevel of the water rises.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement devised by Mr. C.J. Woodward, and recently presented\r\nto the Physical Society of London, is an adaptation of this experiment\r\nto the production of an oscillating motion by alternations in the\r\ninternal and external diffusion of the hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus, represented herewith, consists of a scale beam about\r\nthree feet in length that supports at one end a scale pan and weights,\r\nand, at the other, a corked porous vessel that carries a glass tube,\r\nc, which dips into a vessel containing either water or methylic\r\nalcohol. Three or four gas jets, one of which is shown at E, are\r\narranged around the porous vessel, as close as possible, but in such a\r\nway as not to touch it during the oscillation of the beam. These gas\r\njets communicate with a gasometer tilled with hydrogen, the bell of\r\nwhich is so charged as to furnish a jet of sufficient strength.\r\nExperience will indicate the best place to give the gas jets, but, in\r\ngeneral, it is well to locate them at near the center of the porous\r\nvessel when the beam is horizontal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is now easy to see how the device operates. When the hydrogen comes\r\nin presence of the porous vessel it becomes diffused therein, and the\r\npressure exerted in the interior then produces an ascent. When the\r\nbottom of the porous vessel gets above the jets, the internal\r\ndiffusion ceases and the hydrogen becomes diffused externally, the\r\ninternal pressure diminishes, and the vessel descends. The vessel then\r\ncomes opposite the jets of hydrogen and the same motion occurs again,\r\nand soon indefinitely. The work produced by this motor, which has\r\npurely a scientific interest, is very feeble, and much below that\r\nassigned to it by theory. In order to obtain a maximum, it would be\r\nnecessary to completely surround the porous vessel each time with\r\nhydrogen, and afterward remove the jets to facilitate the access of\r\nair. All the mechanical arrangements employed for obtaining such a\r\nresult have failed, because the friction introduced by the maneuvering\r\nparts also introduces a resistance greater than the motor can\r\novercome. There is therefore a waste of energy due to the continuous\r\nflow of hydrogen; but the apparatus, for all that, constitutes none\r\nthe less an original and interesting device.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME RELATIONS OF HEAT TO VOLTAIC AND THERMO-ELECTRIC ACTION OF METALS\r\nIN ELECTROLYTES.[1]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: Read before the Royal Society, Nov., 1883.]\r\n\r\nBy G. GORE, F.R.S., LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experiments described in this paper throw considerable light upon\r\nthe real cause of the voltaic current. The results of them are\r\ncontained in twenty tables; and by comparing them with each other, and\r\nalso by means of additional experiments, the following general\r\nconclusions and chief facts were obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen metals in liquids are heated, they are more frequently rendered\r\npositive than negative in the proportion of about 2.8 to 1.0; and\r\nwhile the proportion in weak solutions was about 2.29 to 1.0, in\r\nstrong ones it was about 3.27 to 1.0, and this accords with their\r\nthermo-electric behavior as metals alone. The thermo-electric order of\r\nmetals in liquids was, with nearly every solution, whether strong or\r\nweak, widely different from the thermo-electric order of the same\r\nmetals alone. A conclusion previously arrived at was also confirmed,\r\nviz., that the liquids in which the hot metal was thermo-electro-positive\r\nin the largest proportion of cases were those containing highly\r\nelectro-positive bases, such as the alkali metals. The thermo-electric\r\neffect of _gradually_ heating a metal in a liquid was sometimes\r\ndifferent from that of _suddenly_ heating it, and was occasionally\r\nattended by a reversal of the current.\r\n\r\nDegree of strength of liquid greatly affected the thermo-electric\r\norder of metals. Increase of strength usually and considerably\r\nincreased the potential of metals thermo-electro-negative in liquids,\r\nand somewhat increased that of those positive in liquids.\r\n\r\nThe electric potential of metals, thermo-electro-positive in weak\r\nliquids, was usually about 3.87 times, and in strong ones 1.87 times,\r\nas great as of those which were negative. The potential of the\r\nstrongest thermo-electric couple, viz., that of aluminum in weak\r\nsolution of sodic phosphate, was 0.66 volt for 100° F. difference of\r\ntemperature, or about 100 times that of a bismuth and antimony couple.\r\n\r\nHeating one of the metals, either the positive or negative, of a\r\nvoltaic couple, usually increased their electric difference, making\r\nmost metals more positive, and some more negative; while heating the\r\nsecond one also usually neutralized to a large extent the effect of\r\nheating the first one. The electrical effect of heating a voltaic\r\ncouple is nearly wholly composed of the united effects of heating each\r\nof the two metals separately, but is not however exactly the same,\r\nbecause while in the former case the metals are dissimilar, and are\r\nheated to the same temperature, in the latter they are similar, but\r\nheated to different temperatures. Also, when heating a voltaic pair,\r\nthe heat is applied to two metals, both of which are previously\r\nelectro-polar by contact with each other as well as by contact with\r\nthe liquid; but when heating one junction of a metal and liquid\r\ncouple, the metal has not been previously rendered electro-polar by\r\ncontact with a different one, and is therefore in a somewhat different\r\nstate. When a voltaic combination, in which the positive metal is\r\nthermo-negative, and the negative one is thermo-positive, is heated,\r\nthe electric potential of the couple diminishes, notwithstanding that\r\nthe internal resistance is decreased.\r\n\r\nMagnesium in particular, also zinc and cadmium, were greatly depressed\r\nin electromotive force in electrolytes by elevation of temperature.\r\nReversals of position of two metals of a voltaic couple in the tension\r\nseries by rise of temperature were chiefly due to one of the two\r\nmetals increasing in electromotive force faster than the other, and in\r\nmany cases to one metal increasing and the other decreasing in\r\nelectromotive force, but only in a few cases was it a result of\r\nsimultaneous but unequal diminution of potential of the two metals.\r\nWith eighteen different voltaic couples, by rise of temperature from\r\n60° to 160° F., the electromotive force in twelve cases was increased,\r\nand in six decreased, and the average proportions of increase for the\r\neighteen instances was 0.10 volt for the 100° F. of elevation.\r\n\r\nA great difference in chemical composition of the liquid was attended\r\nby a considerable change in the order of the volta-tension series, and\r\nthe differences of such order in two similar liquids, such as\r\nsolutions of hydric chloride and potassic chloride, were much greater\r\nthan those produced in either of those liquids by a difference of 100°\r\nF. of temperature. Difference of strength of solution, like difference\r\nof composition or of temperature, altered the order of such series\r\nwith nearly every liquid; and the amount of such alteration by an\r\nincrease of four or five times in the strength of the liquid was\r\nrather less than that caused by a difference of 100° F. of\r\ntemperature. While also a variation of strength of liquid caused only\r\na moderate amount of change of order in the volta-tension series, it\r\nproduced more than three times that amount of change in the\r\nthermo-electric tension series. The usual effect of increasing the\r\nstrength of the liquid upon the volta-electromotive force was to\r\nconsiderably increase it, but its effect upon the thermo-electro-motive\r\nforce was to largely decrease it. The degree of potential of a metal\r\nand liquid thermo-couple was not always exactly the same at the same\r\ntemperature during a rise as during a fall of temperature; this is\r\nanalogous to the variations of melting and solidifying points of\r\nbodies under such conditions, and also to that of supersaturation of a\r\nliquid by a salt, and is probably due to some hinderance to change of\r\nmolecular movement.\r\n\r\nThe rate of ordinary chemical corrosion of each metal varied in every\r\ndifferent liquid; in each solution also it differed with every\r\ndifferent metal. The most chemically positive metals were usually the\r\nmost quickly corroded, and the corrosion of each metal was usually the\r\nfastest with the most acid solutions. The rate of corrosion at any\r\ngiven temperature was dependent both upon the nature of the metal and\r\nupon that of the liquid, and was limited by the most feebly active of\r\nthe two, usually the electrolyte. The order of rate of corrosion of\r\nmetals also differed in every different liquid. The more dissimilar\r\nthe chemical characters of two liquids, the more diverse usually was\r\nthe order of rapidity of corrosion of a series of metals in them. The\r\norder of rate of simple corrosion in any of the liquids examined\r\ndiffered from that of chemico-electric and still more from that of\r\nthermo-electric tension. Corrosion is not the cause of thermo-electric\r\naction of metals in liquids.\r\n\r\nOut of fifty-eight cases of rise of temperature the rate of ordinary\r\ncorrosion was increased in every instance except one, and that was\r\nonly a feeble exception--the increase of corrosion from 60° to 160° F.\r\nwith different metals was extremely variable, and was from 1.5 to 321.6\r\ntimes. Whether a metal increased or decreased in thermo-electromotive\r\nforce by being heated, it increased in rapidity of corrosion. The\r\nproportions in which the most corroded metal was also the most\r\nthermo-electro-positive one was 65.57 per cent. in liquids at 60° F.,\r\nand 69.12 in the same liquids at 160° F.; and the proportion in which\r\nit was the most chemico-electro-positive at 60 F. was 84.44 per cent,\r\nand at 160° F. 80.77 per cent. The proportion of cases therefore in\r\nwhich the most chemico-electro-negative metal was the most corroded\r\none increased from 15.56 to 19.23 per cent, by a rise of temperature\r\nof 100° F. Comparison of these proportions shows that corrosion\r\nusually influenced in a greater degree chemico-electric rather than\r\nthermo-electric actions of metals in liquids. Not only was the\r\nrelative number of cases in which the volta-negative metal was the\r\nmost corroded increased by rise of temperature, but also the average\r\nrelative loss by corrosion of the negative to that of the positive one\r\nwas increased from 3.11 to 6.32.\r\n\r\nThe explanation most consistent with all the various results and\r\nconclusions is a kinetic one: That metals and electrolytes are\r\nthroughout their masses in a state of molecular vibration. That the\r\nmolecules of those substances, being frictionless bodies in a\r\nfrictionless medium, and their motion not being dissipated by\r\nconduction or radiation, continue incessantly in motion until some\r\ncause arises to prevent them. That each metal (or electrolyte), when\r\nunequally heated, has to a certain extent an unlike class of motions\r\nin its differently heated parts, and behaves in those parts somewhat\r\nlike two metals (or electrolytes), and those unlike motions are\r\nenabled, through the intermediate conducting portion of the substance,\r\nto render those parts electro-polar. That every different metal and\r\nelectrolyte has a different class of motions, and in consequence of\r\nthis, they also, by contact alone with each other at the same\r\ntemperature, become electro-polar. The molecular motion of each\r\ndifferent substance also increases at a different rate by rise of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThis theory is equally in agreement with the chemico-electric results.\r\nIn accordance with it, when in the case of a metal and an electrolyte,\r\nthe two classes of motions are sufficiently unlike, chemical corrosion\r\nof the metal by the liquid takes place, and the voltaic current\r\noriginated by inherent molecular motion, under the condition of\r\ncontact, is maintained by the portions of motion lost by the metal and\r\nliquid during the act of uniting together. Corrosion therefore is an\r\neffect of molecular motion, and is one of the modes by which that\r\nmotion is converted into and produces electric current.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this theory, if we take a thermo-electric pair\r\nconsisting of a non-corrodible metal and an electrolyte (the two being\r\nalready electro-polar by mutual contact), and heat one of their points\r\nof contact, the molecular motions of the heated end of each substance\r\nat the junction are altered; and as thermo-electric energy in such\r\ncombinations usually increases by rise of temperature, the metal and\r\nliquid, each singly, usually becomes more electro polar. In such a\r\ncase the unequally heated metal behaves to some extent like two\r\nmetals, and the unequally heated liquid like two liquids, and so the\r\nthermo-electric pair is like a feeble chemico-electric one of two\r\nmetals in two liquids, but without corrosion of either metal. If the\r\nmetal and liquid are each, when alone, thermo-electro-positive, and if,\r\nwhen in contact, the metal increases in positive condition faster than\r\nthe liquid by being heated, the latter appears thermo-electro-negative,\r\nbut if less rapidly than the liquid, the metal appears\r\nthermo-electro-negative.\r\n\r\nAs also the proportion of cases is small in which metals that are\r\npositive in the ordinary thermo-electric series of metals only become\r\nnegative in the metal and liquid ones (viz., only 73 out of 286 in\r\nweak solutions, and 48 out of the same number in strong ones), we may\r\nconclude that the metals, more frequently than the liquids, have the\r\ngreatest thermo-electric influence, and also that the relative\r\nlargeness of the number of instances of thermo-electro-positive metals\r\nin the series of metals and liquids, as in the series of metals only,\r\nis partly a consequence of the circumstance that rise of temperature\r\nusually makes substances--metals in particular--electro-positive.\r\nThese statements are also consistent with the view that the elementary\r\nsubstances lose a portion of their molecular activity when they unite\r\nto form acids or salts, and that electrolytes therefore have usually a\r\nless degree of molecular motion than the metals of which they are\r\npartly composed.\r\n\r\nThe current from a thermo-couple of metal and liquid, therefore, may\r\nbe viewed as the united result of difference of molecular motion,\r\nfirst, of the two junctions, and second, of the two heated (or cooled)\r\nsubstances; and in all cases, both of thermo- and chemico-electric\r\naction, the immediate true cause of the current is the original\r\nmolecular vibrations of the substances, while contact is only a static\r\npermitting condition. Also that while in the case of thermo-electric\r\naction the sustaining cause is molecular motion, supplied by an\r\nexternal source of heat, in the case of chemico-electric action it is\r\nthe motion lost by the metal and liquid when chemically uniting\r\ntogether. The direction of the current in thermo-electric cases\r\nappears to depend upon which of the two substances composing a\r\njunction increases in molecular activity the fastest by rise of\r\ntemperature, or decreases the most rapidly by cooling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR REFRIGERATING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED AIR REFRIGERATING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nMessrs. J. & E. Hall, Dartford, exhibit at the International Health\r\nExhibition, London, in connection with a cold storage room, two sizes\r\nof Ellis' patent air refrigerator, the larger one capable of\r\ndelivering 5,000 cubic feet of cold air per hour, when running at a\r\nspeed of 150 revolutions per minute; and the smaller one 2,000 cubic\r\nfeet of cold air per hour, at 225 revolutions per minute. The special\r\nfeatures in these machines are the arrangement of parts, by which\r\ngreat compactness is secured, and the adoption of flat slides for the\r\ncompressor, instead of the ordinary beat valves, which permits of a\r\nhigh rate of revolution without the objectionable noise which is\r\ncaused by clacks beating on their seats. The engraving shows the\r\ngeneral arrangement of the apparatus. Figs. 1 to 4 show details of the\r\ncompression and expansion valves, which are ordinary flat slides,\r\npartly balanced, and held up to their faces by strong springs from\r\nbehind. The steam, compression, and expansion cylinders are severally\r\nbolted to the end of a strong frame, which though attached to the\r\ncooler box does not form part of it, the object being to meet the\r\nstrains between the cylinders and shaft in as direct a manner as\r\npossible without allowing them to act on the cooler casting. Each\r\ncylinder is double acting, the pistons being coupled to the shaft by\r\nthree connecting rods, the two outer ones working upon crank pins\r\nfixed to overhung disks, and the center one on a crank formed in the\r\nshaft. The slide valves for all the cylinders are driven from two\r\nweigh shafts, the main valve shaft being actuated by a follow crank,\r\nand the expansion and cut off valves from the crosshead pin of the\r\ncompressor. The machines may be used either in the vertical position\r\nas exhibited, or may be fixed horizontally; and it is stated that the\r\nconstruction is such as to admit of speeds of 200 and 300 revolutions\r\nper minute respectively for the larger and smaller machines, under\r\nwhich conditions the delivery of cold air may be taken at about 7,000\r\nand 2,600 cubic feet per hour. Messrs. Hall also make this class of\r\nrefrigerator without the steam cylinder, and arranged to be driven by\r\na belt from a gas engine or any existing motive power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GAS RADIATOR AND HEATER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1 & Fig. 2 A GAS RADIATOR AND HEATER.]\r\n\r\nThere is now being introduced into Germany a gas radiator and heater,\r\nthe invention of Herr Wobbe. It consists, as will be seen in engraving\r\nabove, of a series of vertical U-shaped pipes, of wrought iron, 50\r\nmillimeters (2 inches) in diameter. The two legs of the U are of\r\nunequal length; the longer being about 5 feet, and the shorter 3 feet\r\n(exclusive of the bend at the top). Beneath the open end of the\r\nshorter leg of each pipe is placed a burner, attached to a horizontal\r\ngas-pipe, which turns upon an axis. The object of having this pipe\r\nrotate is to bring the burners into an inclined position--shown by the\r\ndotted lines in Fig. 2--for lighting them. On turning them back to the\r\nvertical position, the heated products of combustion pass up the\r\nshorter tube and down the longer, where they enter a common\r\nreceptacle, from which they pass into the chimney or out of doors.\r\nSurrounding the pipes are plates of sheet iron, inclined at the angle\r\nshown in Fig. 2. The object of the plates is to prevent the heated air\r\nof the room from passing up to the ceiling, and send it out into the\r\nroom. To prevent any of the pipes acting as chimneys, and bringing the\r\nproducts of combustion back into the room, as well as to avoid any\r\nback-pressure, a damper is attached to the outlet receptacle. The\r\nheated gas becomes cooled so much (to about 100° Fahr.) that water is\r\ncondensed and precipitated, and collects in the vessel below the\r\noutlet. Each burner has a separate cock, by which it may be kept\r\nclosed, half-open, or open. To obviate danger of explosion, there is a\r\nstrip of sheet iron in front of the burners, which prevents their\r\nbeing lighted when in a vertical position; so that, in case any\r\nunburned gas gets into the pipes, it cannot be ignited, for the\r\nburners can only be lighted when inclined to the front. In starting\r\nthe stove the burners are lighted, in the inclined position; the chain\r\nfrom the damper pulled up; the burners set vertical; and, as soon as\r\nthey are all drawing well into the tubes, the damper is closed. If\r\nless heat is desired, the cocks are turned half off. It is not\r\npermissible to entirely extinguish some of the burners, unless the\r\nunused pipes are closed to prevent the products of combustion coming\r\nback into the room. The consumption of gas per burner, full open, with\r\na pressure of 8/10, is said to be only 4-3/8 cubic feet per hour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCRETE WATER PIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcrete water pipes of small diameter, according to a foreign\r\ncontemporary, are used in parts of France, notably for water mains for\r\nthe towns of Coulommiers and Aix-en-Provence. The pipes were formed of\r\nconcrete in the trench itself. The mould into which the concrete was\r\nstamped was sheet iron about two yards in length. The several pipes\r\nwere not specially joined to each other, the joints being set with\r\nmortar. The concrete consisted of three parts of slow setting cement\r\nand three parts of river sand, mixed with five parts of limestone\r\ndebris. The inner diameter of the pipes was nine inches; their\r\nthickness, three inches. The average fall is given at one in five\r\nhundred; the lowest speed of the current at one foot nine inches per\r\nsecond. To facilitate the cleaning of the pipes, man-holes are\r\nconstructed every one hundred yards or so, the sides of which are also\r\nmade of concrete. The trenches are about five feet deep. The work was\r\ndone by four men, who laid down nearly two hundred feet of pipe in a\r\nworking day; the cost was about ninety-three cents per running yard.\r\nIt is claimed as an advantage for the new method that the pipes adhere\r\nclosely to the inequalities of the trench, and thus lie firmly on the\r\nground. When submitted to great pressure, however, they have not\r\nproved effective, and the method, consequently, is only suitable for\r\npipes in which there is no pressure, or only a very trifling one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SELLERS STANDARD SYSTEM OF SCREW THREADS, NUTS, AND BOLT HEADS.\r\n\r\n\r\n

diameter of hole in nuts and diameter of lap drills. All bolts and\r\nstuds 3/4 in. diameter and above, screwed into boilers, have 12\r\nthreads per inch, sharp thread, a taper of 1/16 in. per 1 inch; tap\r\ndrill should be 9/64 in. less than normal diameter of bolts.\r\n\r\nThe table is based upon the following general formulæ for certain\r\ndimensions:\r\n\r\n  Short diam. rough nut or head = 11/2 diam. of bolt + 1/8.\r\n       \"   finished nut or head = 11/2 diam. of bolt + 1/16.\r\n  Thickness rough nut = diameter of bolt.\r\n  Thickness finished nut = diameter of bolt - 1/16.\r\n  Thickness rough head = 1/2 short diameter.\r\n  Thickness finished head = diameter of bolt - 1/16.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENGLISH RAILWAY FERRY BOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ENGLISH RAILWAY FERRY BOAT.]\r\n\r\nThe illustrations above represent a double screw steam ferry boat for\r\ntransporting railway carriages, vehicles, and passengers, etc.,\r\ndesigned and constructed by Messrs. Edwards and Symes, of Cubitt Town,\r\nLondon. The hull is constructed of iron, and is of the following\r\ndimensions: Length 60 ft.; beam 16 ft.; over sponsons 25 ft. The\r\nvessel was fitted with a propeller, rudder, and steering gear at each\r\nend, to enable it to run in either direction without having to turn\r\naround. The boat was designed for the purpose of working the train\r\nservice across the bay of San Juan, in the island of Puerto Rico, and\r\nfor this purpose a single line of steel rails, of meter gauge, is laid\r\nalong the center of the deck, and also along the hinged platforms at\r\neach end. In the engraving these platforms are shown, one hoisted up,\r\nand the other lowered to the level of the deck. When the boat is at\r\none of the landing stages, the platform is lowered to the level of the\r\nrails on the pier, and the carriages and trucks are run on to the deck\r\nby means of the small hauling engine, which works an endless chain\r\nrunning the whole length of the deck. The trucks, etc., being on\r\nboard, the platform is raised by means of two compact hand winches\r\nworked by worm and worm-wheels in the positions shown; thus these two\r\nplatforms form the end bulwarks to the boat when crossing the bay. On\r\narriving at the opposite shore the operation is repeated, the other\r\nplatform is lowered, and the hauling engine runs the trucks, etc., on\r\nto the shore. With a load of 25 tons the draught is 4 ft.\r\n\r\nThe seats shown on the deck are for the convenience of foot\r\npassengers, and the whole of the deck is protected from the sun of\r\nthat tropical climate by a canvas awning. The steering of the vessel\r\nis effected from the bridge at the center, which extends from side to\r\nside of the vessel, and there are two steering wheels with independent\r\nsteering gear for each end, with locking gear for the forward rudder\r\nwhen in motion. The man at the wheel communicates with the engineer by\r\nmeans of a speaking tube at the wheel. There is a small deck house for\r\nthe use of deck stores, on one side of which is the entrance to the\r\nengine room. The cross battens, shown between the rails, are for the\r\npurpose of horse traffic, when horses are used for hauling the trucks,\r\nor for ordinary carts or wagons. The plan below deck shows the\r\narrangement of the bulkheads, with a small windlass at each end for\r\nlifting the anchors, and a small hatch at each side for entrance to\r\nthese compartments. The central compartment contains the machinery,\r\nwhich consists of a pair of compound surface condensing engines, with\r\ncylinders 11 in. and 20 in. in diameter; the shafting running the\r\nwhole length of the vessel, with a propeller at each end. Steam is\r\ngenerated in a steel boiler of locomotive form, so arranged that the\r\nfunnel passes through the deck at the side of the vessel; and it is\r\ndesigned for a working pressure of 100 lb. per square inch. This\r\nboiler also supplies steam for the small hauling engine fixed on the\r\nbulkhead. Light to this compartment is obtained by means of large side\r\nscuttles along each side of the boat and glass deck lights, and the\r\niron grating at the entrance near the deck house. This boat was\r\nconstructed in six pieces for shipment, and the whole put together in\r\nthe builders' yard. The machinery was fixed, and the engine driven by\r\nsteam from its own boiler, then the whole was marked and taken\r\nasunder, and shipped to the West Indies, where it was put together and\r\nfound to answer the purpose intended.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[For THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF FLIGHT, AND THE FLYING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of reading the various communications to the SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN and SUPPLEMENT, and _Van Nostrand's Engineering Magazine_,\r\nincluding descriptions of proposed and tested machines, and the\r\nreports of the British Aeronautical Society, the writer of the\r\nfollowing concludes:\r\n\r\nThat, as precedents for the construction of a successful flying\r\nmachine, the investigation of some species of birds as a base of the\r\nprinciples of all is correct only in connection with the species and\r\nhabits of the bird; that the _general mechanical principles_ of flight\r\napplicable to the _operation_ of the _same unit_ of wing in _all_\r\nspecies are alone applicable to the flying machine.\r\n\r\nThat these principles of _operation_ do not demand the principles of\r\n_construction_ of the bird.\r\n\r\nThat as the wing is in its stroke an arc of a screw propeller's\r\noperation, and in its angle a screw propeller blade, its animal\r\noperation compels its reciprocation instead of rotation.\r\n\r\nThat the swifter the wing beat, the more efficient its effect per unit\r\nof surface, the greater the load carried, and the swifter the flight.\r\n\r\nThat the screw action being, in full flight, that of a screw propeller\r\nwhose axis of rotation forms a slight angle with the vertical, the\r\ndistance of flight per virtual \"revolution\" of \"screw\" wing far\r\nexceeds the pitch distance of said \"screw.\"\r\n\r\nThat consequently a bird's flight answers to an iceboat close hauled;\r\nthe wing _force_ answering to the _wind_, the wing _angle_ to the\r\n_sail_, the bird's _weight_ to the leeway fulcrum of the _ice_, and\r\nthe passage across direction of the _wing_ flop to the fresh _moving_\r\n\"inertia\" of the wind, both yielding a maximum of force to bird or\r\niceboat.\r\n\r\nThat the speed of _reciprocation_ of a fly's _wing_ being equivalent\r\nto a _screw rotation_ of 9,000 per minute, proves that a _screw_ may\r\nbe run at this speed without losing efficiency by centrifugal vacuum.\r\n\r\nThat as the _object_ of wing or screw is to mount upon the inertia of\r\nthe particles of a mobile fluid, and as the rotation of steamship\r\npropellers in water--a fluid of many times the inertia of air--is\r\n_already_ in _excess_ of the highest speed heretofore tried in the\r\npropellers of moderately successful flying machines, it is plain that\r\nthe speed employed in _water_ must be many times exceeded in _air_.\r\n\r\nThat with a _sufficient_ speed of rotation, the supporting power of\r\nthe inertia of air must _equal_ that of _water_.\r\n\r\nThat as mere speed of rotation of propeller _shaft_, minus blades,\r\nmust absorb but a small proportion of power of engine, the addition of\r\nblades will not cause more resistance than that actually encountered\r\nfrom inertia of air.\r\n\r\nThat this must be the measure of load lifted.\r\n\r\nThat without _slip_ of screw, the actual _power_ expended, will be\r\nlittle in _excess_ of that required to support the machine in _water_,\r\nwith a slower rotation of screw.\r\n\r\nThat in case the same _power_ is expended in water or air, the only\r\ndifference will lie in the sizes and speed of engines or screws.\r\n\r\nThat the _greater_ the speed, the _less_ weight of engine, boiler, and\r\nscrew must be, and the stronger their construction.\r\n\r\nThat, in consequence, solid metal worked down, instead of bolts and\r\ntruss work, must be used.\r\n\r\nThat as the bird wing is a screw in action, and acts _directly_\r\nbetween the inertias of the load and the air, the position and\r\noperation of the screw, to the load, must imitate it.\r\n\r\nThat, in consequence, machines having wing planes, driven _against_\r\none inertia of air by screws acting in the line, of flight against\r\nanother inertia of air, lose fifty per cent. of useful effect, besides\r\nexposing to a head wind the cross section of the stationary screw wing\r\nplanes and the rotating screw discs; and supporting the dead weight of\r\nthe wing planes, and having all the screw slip in the line of flight,\r\nand carrying slow and heavy engines.\r\n\r\nThat as a result of these conclusions, the supporting and propelling\r\npower should be expressed in the rotation of screws combining both\r\nfunctions, the position of whose planes of rotation to a fixed\r\nhorizontal line of direction determines the progress and speed of\r\nmachine upon other lines.\r\n\r\nThat the whole weight carried by the screws should be at all times\r\nexactly below the center of gravity of the plane of support, whether\r\nit be horizontal or inclined.\r\n\r\nThat while the _permanently_ positioned weight, such as the engines,\r\nframe, holding screws, etc., may be rigidly connected to or around the\r\nscrew plane of support, the variable positioned weight, such as the\r\npassenger and the car, should be connected by a _flexible joint_ to\r\nthe said plane of support.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the car may oscillate without altering its weight\r\nposition under center of supporting plane, thus avoiding an\r\ninvoluntary alteration of speed or direction of flight.\r\n\r\nThat to steer a machine so constructed, it is merely necessary to move\r\nthe point of attachment of car to _machine_ proper, out of the center\r\nof plane of support in the desired direction, and thus cause the plane\r\nof support or rotation of propellers to incline in that direction.\r\n\r\nThat the reservoir of power, the boiler, etc., should be placed in the\r\n_car_, and steam carried to engines through joint connecting car with\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThat at present material exists, and power also, of sufficient\r\nlightness and strength to admit of a machine construction capable of a\r\nlimited successful flight in any fair wind and direction.\r\n\r\nThat such _machine_ once built, the finding of a _power_ for long\r\nflights will be easy, if not already close at hand in _electricity_.\r\n\r\nThat the _easiest_ design for such _actual machine_ should be adopted,\r\nleaving the adaptation of the principles involved to the making of\r\nmore perfect machines, to a time after the success of the _first_.\r\n\r\nThat such design may be a propeller, and its engine at each end of a\r\nsteel frame tube, supporting tube horizontally, a car to be supported\r\nby a universal joint from center of said tube, and the joint apparatus\r\nmovable along the tube or a short distance transverse to it, to alter\r\nposition of center of gravity.\r\n\r\nThat the machine so built might traverse the water as well as air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONGHAIRED POINTER MYLORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nPointers are trained to search for game, and to indicate that they\r\nhave found the same by standing motionless in front of it, and, when\r\nit has been shot, to carry the game to the huntsman. Several kinds of\r\npointers are known, such as smooth, longhaired, and bushyhaired\r\npointers. The smoothhaired pointers are better for hunting on high\r\nland, whereas the longhaired or bushyhaired dogs are better for low,\r\nmarshy countries, crossed by numerous streams, etc. Mylord, the dog\r\nrepresented in the annexed cut taken from the _Illustrirte Zeitung_,\r\nis an excellent specimen of the longhaired pointer, and is owned by\r\nMr. G. Borcher, of Braunschweig, Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LONGHAIRED POINTER, \"MYLORD.\"]\r\n\r\nThe longhaired pointer is generally above the medium size, powerful,\r\nsomewhat longer than the normal dog, the body is narrower and not\r\nquite as round as that of the smoothhaired dog, and the muscles of the\r\nshoulders and hind legs are not as well developed and not as\r\nprominent. The head and neck are erect, the head being specially long,\r\nand the tail is almost horizontal to the middle, and then curves\r\nupward slightly. The long hair hangs in wavy lines on both sides of\r\nhis body. The expression of his face is intelligent, bright, and\r\ngood-natured, and his step is light and almost noiseless.\r\n\r\nThe pointer is specially valuable, as it can be employed for many\r\ndifferent purposes; he is an excellent dog for the woods, for the\r\nwoodsman and hunter who uses only one dog for different kinds of game.\r\nThe intelligence of the German pointer is very great, but he does not\r\ndevelop as rapidly as the English dog, which has been raised for\r\ngenerations for one purpose only. The German pointer hunts very\r\nslowly, but surely. It is not difficult to train this dog, but he\r\ncannot be trained until he has reached a certain age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNAR HEAT.\r\n\r\nBy Professor C.A. YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting inquiries relating to the moon is that\r\nwhich deals with the heat she sends us, and the probable temperature\r\nof her surface. The problem seems to have been first attacked by\r\nTschirnhausen and La Hire, about 1700; and they both found, that even\r\nwhen the moon's rays were concentrated by the most powerful\r\nburning-lenses and mirrors they could obtain, its heat was too small\r\nto produce the slightest perceptible effect on the most delicate\r\nthermometers then known. For more than a hundred years, this was all\r\nthat could be made out, though the experiment was often repeated.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1831 that Melloni, with his newly-invented\r\n\"thermopile,\" [1] succeeded in making the lunar heat sensible; and in\r\n1835, taking his apparatus to the top of Vesuvius, he obtained not\r\nonly perceptible, but measurable, results, getting a deviation of four\r\nor five divisions of his galvanometer.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: Probably most of our readers know that the\r\n   thermopile consists of a number of little bars of two different\r\n   metals, connected in pairs, and having the ends joined in a\r\n   conducting circuit with a galvanometer. If, now, one set of the\r\n   junctures is heated more than the other set, a current of\r\n   electricity will be generated, which will affect the\r\n   galvanometer. The bars are usually made of bismuth and antimony\r\n   though iron and German silver answer pretty well. They are\r\n   commonly about half or three-quarters of an inch long, and about\r\n   half as large as an ordinary match. The \"pile\" is made of from\r\n   fifty to a hundred such bars packed closely, but insulated by\r\n   thin strips of mica, except just at the soldered junctions. With\r\n   an instrument of this kind and a very delicate galvanometer,\r\n   Professor Henry found that the heat from a person's face could be\r\n   perceived at a distance of several hundred feet. There is\r\n   however, some doubt whether he was not mistaken in respect to\r\n   this extreme sensitiveness.]\r\n\r\nOthers repeated the experiment several times between this time and\r\n1856, with more or less success; but, so far as I know, the first\r\nquantitative result was that obtained in 1856 by Piazzi Smyth during\r\nhis Teneriffe expedition. On the top of the mountain, at an elevation\r\nof ten thousand feet, he found that the moon's rays affected his\r\nthermopile to the same extent as a standard candle ten feet away.\r\nMarie Davy has since shown that this corresponds to a heating effect\r\nof about 1/1300 of a Centigrade degree.\r\n\r\nThe subject was resumed in 1868 by Lord Rosse in Ireland; and a long\r\nseries of observations, running through several years, was made by the\r\naid of his three-foot reflector (not the great _six_-foot instrument,\r\nwhich is too unwieldy for such work). The results of his work have,\r\nuntil very recently, been accepted as authoritative. It should be\r\nmentioned that, at about the same time, observations were also made at\r\nParis by Marie Davy and Martin; but they are generally looked upon\r\nmerely as corroborative of Rosse's work, which was more elaborate and\r\nextensive. Rosse considered that his results show that the heat from\r\nthe moon is mainly _obscure, radiated_ heat; the _reflected_ heat,\r\naccording to him, being much less in amount.\r\n\r\nA moment's thought will show that the moon's heat must consist of two\r\nportions. First, there will be _reflected solar heat_. The amount and\r\ncharacter of this will depend in no way upon the temperature of the\r\nmoon's surface, but solely upon its reflecting power. And it is to be\r\nnoted that moon-_light_ is only a part of this reflected radiant\r\nenergy, differing from the invisible portion of the same merely in\r\nhaving such a wave-length and vibration period as to bring it within\r\nthe range of perception of the human eye.\r\n\r\nThe second portion of the heat sent us by the moon is that which she\r\nemits on her own account as a warm body--warmed, of course, mainly, if\r\nnot entirely, by the action of the sun. The amount of _this_ heat will\r\ndepend upon the temperature of the moon's surface and its radiating\r\npower; and the temperature will depend upon a number of things\r\n(chiefly heat-absorbing power of the surface, and the nature and\r\ndensity of the lunar atmosphere, as well as the supply of heat\r\nreceived from the sun), being determined by a balance between give and\r\ntake. So long as more heat is received in a second than is thrown off\r\nin the same time, the temperature will rise, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, further, that this second component of the moon's\r\nthermal radiance must be mainly what is called \"obscure\" or dark heat,\r\nlike that from a stove or teakettle, and characterized by the same\r\nwant of penetrative power. No one knows why at present; but it is a fact\r\nthat the heat-radiations from bodies at a low temperature--radiations\r\nof which the vibrations are relatively slow, and the wave-length\r\ngreat--have no such power of penetrating transparent media as the\r\nhigher-pitched vibrations which come from incandescent bodies. A great\r\npart, therefore, of this contingent of the lunar heat is probably\r\nstopped in the upper air, and never reaches the surface of the earth\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nNow, the thermopile cannot, of course, discriminate directly between\r\nthe two portions of the lunar heat; but to some extent it does enable\r\nus to do so indirectly, since they vary in quite a different way with\r\nthe moon's age. The simple _reflected_ heat must follow the same law\r\nas moonlight, and come to its maximum at full moon. The _radiated_\r\nheat, on the other hand, will reach its maximum when the average\r\ntemperature of that part of the moon's surface turned toward the earth\r\nis highest; and this must be some time after full moon, for the same\r\nsort of reasons that make the hottest part of a summer's day come two\r\nor three hours after noon.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion early reached by Lord Rosse was that nearly all the\r\nlunar heat belonged to the second category--dark heat _radiated_ from\r\nthe moon's warmed surface, the _reflected_ portion being comparatively\r\nsmall--and he estimated that the temperature of the hottest parts of\r\nthe moon's surface must run as high as 500° F.; well up toward the\r\nboiling-point of mercury. Since the lunar day is a whole month long,\r\nand there are never any clouds in the lunar sky, it is easy to imagine\r\nthat along toward two or three o'clock in the lunar afternoon (if I\r\nmay use the expression), the weather gets pretty hot; for when the sun\r\nstands in the lunar sky as it does at Boston at two P.M., it has been\r\nshining continuously for more than two hundred hours. On the other\r\nhand, the coldest parts of the moon's surface, when the sun has only\r\njust risen after a night of three hundred and forty hours, must have a\r\ntemperature more than a hundred degrees below zero.\r\n\r\nLord Rosse's later observations modified his conclusions, to some\r\nextent, showing that he had at first underestimated the percentage of\r\nsimple reflected heat, but without causing him to make any radical\r\nchange in his ideas as to the maximum heat of the moon's surface.\r\n\r\nFor some time, however, there has been a growing skepticism among\r\nastronomers, relating not so much to the correctness of his measures\r\nas to the computations by which he inferred the high percentage of\r\nobscure radiated beat compared with the reflected heat, and so deduced\r\nthe high temperature of lunar noon.\r\n\r\nProfessor Langley, who is now engaged in investigating the subject,\r\nfinds himself compelled to believe that the lunar surface never gets\r\neven comfortably warm--because it has no blanket. It receives heat, it\r\nis true, from the sun, and probably some twenty-five or thirty per\r\ncent. more than the earth, since there are no clouds and no air to\r\nabsorb a large proportion of the incident rays; but, at the same time,\r\nthere is nothing to retain the heat, and prevent the radiation into\r\nspace as soon as the surface begins to warm. We have not yet the data\r\nto determine exactly how much the temperature of the lunar rocks would\r\nhave to be raised above the absolute zero (-273° C. or -459° F.) in\r\norder that they might throw off into space as much heat in a second as\r\nthey would get from the sun in a second. But Professor Langley's\r\nobservations, made on Mount Whitney at an elevation of fifteen\r\nthousand feet, when the barometer stood at seventeen inches\r\n(indicating that about fifty-seven per cent. of the air was still\r\nabove him), showed that rocks exposed to the perpendicular rays of the\r\nsun were not heated to any such extent as those at the base of the\r\nmountain similarly exposed; and the difference was so great as to make\r\nit almost certain that a mass of rock not covered by a reasonably\r\ndense atmosphere could never attain a temperature of even 200° or 300°\r\nF. under solar radiation, however long continued.\r\n\r\nIt must, in fact, be considered at present extremely doubtful whether\r\nany portion of the moon's surface ever reaches a temperature as high\r\nas -100°.\r\n\r\nThe subject, undoubtedly, needs further investigation, and it is now\r\nreceiving it. Professor Langley is at work upon it with new and\r\nspecially constructed apparatus, including a \"bolometer\" so sensitive\r\nthat, whereas previous experimenters have thought themselves fortunate\r\nif they could get deflections of ten or twelve galvanometric divisions\r\nto work with, he easily obtains three or four hundred. We have no time\r\nor space here to describe Professor Langley's \"bolometer;\" it must\r\nsuffice to say that it seems to stand to the thermopile much as that\r\ndoes to the thermometer. There is good reason to believe that its\r\ninventor will be able to advance our knowledge of the subject by a\r\nlong and important step; and it is no breach of confidence to add that\r\nso far, although the research is not near completion yet, everything\r\nseems to confirm the belief that the radiated heat of the moon,\r\ninstead of forming the principal part of the heat we get from her, is\r\nrelatively almost insignificant, and that the lunar surface now never\r\nexperiences a _thaw_ under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nSince the superstition as to the moon's influence upon the wind and\r\nweather is so widespread and deep seated, a word on that subject may\r\nbe in order. In the first place, since the total heat received from\r\nthe moon, even according to the highest determination (that of Smyth),\r\nis not so much as 0.00001 of that received from the sun, and since the\r\nonly hold the moon has on the earth's weather is through the heat she\r\nsends us (I ignore here the utterly insignificant atmospheric _tide_),\r\nit follows necessarily that her influence _must_ be very trifling. In\r\nthe next place, all carefully collated observations show that it _is_\r\nso, and not only trifling, but generally absolutely insensible.\r\n\r\nFor example, different investigators have examined the question of\r\nnocturnal cloudiness at the time of full moon, there being a prevalent\r\nbelief that the full moon \"eats up\" light clouds. On comparing thirty\r\nor forty years' observations at each of several stations (Greenwich.\r\nParis, etc.), it is found that there is no ground for the belief. And\r\nso in almost every case of imagined lunar meteorological influence. As\r\nto the coincidence of weather changes with changes of the moon, it is\r\nenough to say that the idea is absolutely inconsistent with that\r\nprogressive movement of the \"weather\" across the country from west to\r\neast, with which the Signal Service has now made us all so familiar.\r\n\r\nPrinceton, April 12, 1884.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE TREE BORERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apple tree borers have destroyed thousands of trees in New\r\nEngland, and are likely to destroy thousands more. There are three\r\nkinds of borers which assail the apple tree. The round headed or two\r\nstriped apple tree borer, _Saperda candida_, is a native of this\r\ncountry, infesting the native crabs, thorn bushes, and June berry. It\r\nwas first described by Thomas Say, in 1824, but was probably widely\r\ndistributed before that. In his \"Insects Injurious to Fruit,\" Prof.\r\nSaunders thus describes the borer:\r\n\r\n\"In its perfect state it is a very handsome beetle, about\r\nthree-quarters of an inch long, cylindrical in form, of a pale brown\r\ncolor, with two broad, creamy white stripes running the whole length\r\nof its body; the face and under surface are hoary white, the antennæ\r\nand legs gray. The females are larger than the males, and have shorter\r\nantennæ. The beetle makes its appearance during the months of June and\r\nJuly, usually remaining in concealment during the day, and becoming\r\nactive at dusk. The eggs are deposited late in June and during July,\r\none in a place, on the bark of the tree, near its base. Within two\r\nweeks the young worms are hatched, and at once commence with their\r\nsharp mandibles to gnaw their way through the outer bark to the\r\ninterior. It is generally conceded that the larvæ are three years in\r\nreaching maturity. The young ones lie for the first year in the\r\nsapwood and the inner bark, excavating flat, shallow cavities, about\r\nthe size of a silver dollar, which are filled with their sawdust-like\r\ncastings. The holes by which they enter being small are soon filled\r\nup, though not until a few grains of castings have fallen from them.\r\nTheir presence may, however, often be detected in young trees from the\r\nbark becoming dark colored, and sometimes dry and dead enough to\r\ncrack.\"\r\n\r\nOn the approach of winter, it descends to the lower part of its\r\nburrow, where it remains inactive until spring. The second season it\r\ncontinues its work in the sapwood, and in case two or three are at\r\nwork in the same tree may completely girdle it, thus destroying it.\r\nThe third year it penetrates to the heart of the tree, makes an\r\nexcavation, and awaits its transformation. The fourth spring it comes\r\nforth a perfect beetle, and lays its eggs for another generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLAT-HEADED BORER.\r\n\r\nThe flat-headed apple tree borer, _Chrysobothris femorata_, is also a\r\nnative of this country. It is a very active insect, delights to bask\r\nin the hot sunshine; runs up and down the tree with great rapidity,\r\nbut flies away when molested. It is about half an inch in length. \"It\r\nis of a flattish, oblong form, and of a shining, greenish black color,\r\neach of its wing cases having three raised lines, the outer two\r\ninterrupted by two impressed transverse spots of brassy color dividing\r\neach wing cover into three nearly equal portions. The under side of\r\nthe body and legs shine like burnished copper; the feet are shining\r\ngreen.\" This beetle appears in June and July, and does not confine its\r\nwork to the base of the tree, but attacks the trunk in any part, and\r\nsometimes the larger branches. The eggs are deposited in cracks or\r\ncrevices of the bark, and soon hatch. The young larva eats its way\r\nthrough the bark and sapwood, where it bores broad and flat channels,\r\nsometimes girdling and killing the tree. As it approaches maturity, it\r\nbores deeper into the tree, working upward, then eats out to the bark,\r\nbut not quite through the bark, where it changes into a beetle, and\r\nthen cuts through the bark and emerges to propagate its kind. This\r\ninsect is sought out when just beneath the bark, and devoured by\r\nwoodpeckers and insect enemies.\r\n\r\nAnother borer, the long-horned borer, _Leptostylus aculifer_, is\r\nwidely distributed, but is not a common insect, and does not cause\r\nmuch annoyance to the fruit grower. It appears in August, and deposits\r\nits eggs upon the trunks of apple trees. The larvæ soon hatch, eat\r\nthrough the bark, and burrow in the outer surface of the wood just\r\nunder the bark.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION AGAINST BORERS.\r\n\r\nThe practical point is, What remedies can be used to prevent the\r\nravages of the borers? The usual means of fighting the borers is, to\r\nseek after them in the burrows, and try to kill them by digging them\r\nout, or by reaching them with a wire. This seems to be the most\r\neffectual method of dealing with them after they have once entered the\r\ntree, but the orchardist should endeavor to prevent the insects from\r\nentering the tree. For this purpose, various washes have been\r\nrecommended for applying to the tree, either for destroying the young\r\nlarvæ before they enter the bark, or for preventing the beetles\r\ndepositing their eggs. It has been found that trees which have been\r\ncoated with alkaline washes are avoided by beetles when laying their\r\neggs. Prof. Saunders recommends that soft soap be reduced to the\r\nconsistency of a thick paint, by the addition of a strong solution of\r\nwashing soda in water, and be applied to the bark of the tree,\r\nespecially about the base or collar, and also extended upward to the\r\ncrotches where the main branches have their origin. It should be\r\napplied in the evening of a warm day, so that it may dry and form a\r\ncoating not easily dissolved by the rain. This affords a protection\r\nagainst all three kinds of borers. It should be applied early in June,\r\nbefore the beetles begin to lay their eggs, and again in July, so as\r\nto keep the tree well protected.\r\n\r\nHon. T.S. Gold, of Connecticut, at a meeting of the Massachusetts\r\nState Board of Agriculture, in regard to preventing the ravages of the\r\nborer, said:\r\n\r\n\"A wash made of soap, tobacco water, and fresh cow manure mingled to\r\nthe consistency of cream, and put on early with an old broom, and\r\nallowed to trickle down about the roots of the tree, has proved with\r\nme a very excellent preventive of the ravages of the borer, and a\r\nhealthful wash for the trunk of the tree, much to be preferred to the\r\napplication of lime or whitewash, which I have often seen applied, but\r\nwhich I am inclined to think is not as desirable an application as the\r\npotash, or the soda, as this mixture of soft soap and manure.\"\r\n\r\nJ.B. Moore, of Concord, Mass., at the same meeting said, in regard to\r\nthe destruction of the borer:\r\n\r\n\"I have found, I think, that whale oil soap can be used successfully\r\nfor the destruction of that insect. It is a very simple thing; it will\r\nnot hurt the tree if you put it on its full strength. You can take\r\nwhale oil soap and dilute until it is about as thick as paint, and put\r\na coating of it on the tree where the holes are, and I will bet you\r\nwill never see a borer on that tree until the new crop comes. I feel\r\ncertain of it, because I have done it.\"\r\n\r\nFor borers, tarred paper 1 or 2 feet wide has been recommended to be\r\nwrapped about the base of the trunk of the tree, the lower edge being\r\n1 or 2 inches below the surface of the soil. This prevents the\r\ntwo-striped borer from laying its eggs in the tree, but would not be\r\nentirely effectual against the flat-headed borer, which attacks any\r\npart of the trunk and the branches. By the general use of these means\r\nfor the prevention of the ravages of the borers, the damages done by\r\nthese insects could be brought within very narrow limits, and hundreds\r\nof valuable apple trees saved.\r\n\r\nH.

It is based upon a direct\r\nobservation, of the germination of the seeds to be studied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KEFFEL'S GERMINATING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a cylindrical vessel containing water to the\r\nheight of 0.07 m. Above the water is a germinating disk containing 100\r\napertures for the insertion of the seeds to be studied, the\r\ngerminating end of the latter being directed toward the water. After\r\nthe seeds are in place the disk is filled with damp sand up to the top\r\nof its rim, and the apparatus is closed with a cover which carries in\r\nits center a thermometer whose bulb nearly reaches the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is then set in a place where the temperature is about\r\n18°, and where there are no currents of air. An accurate result is\r\nreached at the end of about twenty or twenty-four hours. As the\r\ngerminating disk contains 100 apertures for as many seeds, it is only\r\nnecessary to count the number of seeds that have germinated in order\r\nto get the percentage of fresh and stale ones.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous vapor that continuously moistens all the seeds, under\r\nabsolutely identical conditions for each, brings about their\r\ngermination under good conditions for accuracy and comparison. If it\r\nbe desired to observe the starting of the leaves, it is only necessary\r\nto remove the cover after the seeds have germinated.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious device is certainly capable of rendering services to\r\nbrewers, distillers, seedsmen, millers, farmers, and gardeners, and it\r\nmay prove useful to those who have horses to feed, and to amateur\r\ngardeners, since it permits of ascertaining the value and quality of\r\nseeds of every nature.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe season is now at hand when farmers who have light lands, and who\r\nmay possibly find themselves short of fodder for next winter feeding,\r\nshould prepare for a crop of millet. This is a plant that rivals corn\r\nfor enduring a drought, and for rapid growth. There are three popular\r\nvarieties now before the public, besides others not yet sufficiently\r\ntested for full indorsement--the coarse, light colored millet, with a\r\nrough head, Hungarian millet, with a smooth, dark brown head, yielding\r\nseeds nearly black, and a newer, light colored, round seeded, and\r\nlater variety, known as the golden millet.\r\n\r\nHungarian millet has been the popular variety with us for many years,\r\nalthough the light seeded, common millet is but slightly different in\r\nappearance or value for cultivation. They grow in a short time, eight\r\nweeks being amply sufficient for producing a forage crop, though a\r\ncouple of weeks more would be required for maturing the seed. Millet\r\nshould not be sown in early spring, when the weather and ground are\r\nboth cold. It requires the hot weather of June and July to do well;\r\nthen it will keep ahead of most weeds, while if sown in April the\r\nweeds on foul land would smother it.\r\n\r\nMillet needs about two months to grow in, but if sowed late in July it\r\nwill seem to \"hurry up,\" and make a very respectable showing in less\r\ntime. We have sown it in August, and obtained a paying crop, but do\r\nnot recommend it for such late seeding, as there are other plants that\r\nwill give better satisfaction. Golden millet has been cultivated but a\r\nfew years in this country, and as yet is but little known, but from a\r\nfew trials we have been quite favorably impressed with it. It is\r\ncoarser than the other varieties, but cattle appear to be very fond of\r\nit nevertheless. It resembles corn in its growth nearly as much as\r\ngrass, and, compared with the former, it is fine and soft, and it\r\ncures readily, like grass, and may be packed away in hay mows with\r\nperfect safety. It is about two weeks later than the other millets,\r\nand consequently cannot be grown in quite so short a time, although it\r\nmay produce as much weight to the acre, in a given period, as either\r\nof the other more common varieties. A bushel of seed per acre is not\r\ntoo much for either variety of millet.--_N.E.
