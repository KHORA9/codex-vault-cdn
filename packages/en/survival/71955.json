P.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nHaving had the honor to spend nineteen years in your service as\r\nresident Land Agent—having during that period, as well as since,\r\nreceived from you many marks of favour—having on your Estate laid the\r\nfoundation, and to some extent tested the accuracy, of the opinions\r\nwhich are given in the following pages; I am, I assure you, deeply\r\ngrateful for the kind permission with which you have favoured me, to\r\ndedicate them to you.\r\n\r\nIf I were to allow myself to indulge in the expression of feelings,\r\nwhich a recollection of my long connection with your Estates might\r\nprompt, I should risk your displeasure, for I well know, how\r\ndistasteful to you would be the language of adulation; I shall\r\ntherefore only add, that it gives me pleasure to dedicate my Book to\r\nyou, because, from long experience, I know you to be the zealous patron\r\nof improvement in every department of rural economy, and because you\r\nare practically and intimately acquainted with the subject on which I\r\nhave written.\r\n\r\nEncouraging as it would be to me if it were so, I do not expect\r\nthat you will concur with me in all the views to which I have given\r\nexpression: nevertheless, I trust I may be allowed to hope that, in\r\nthe main, the principles which are developed will approve themselves to\r\nyour judgment, and command your approbation.\r\n\r\n  I have the honor to be,\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n  Your most obedient obliged Servant,\r\n\r\n  J. WEST.\r\n\r\n  _North Collingham, Notts.\r\n  13th June, 1842._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has probably been with many others as it is with the writer of\r\nthis, who finds the little which he has to say by way of Preface, more\r\ndisagreeable, and more difficult, than he has found any other part of\r\nhis book. A Preface, however, of some sort or other, must be written.\r\n\r\nThe writer cannot say, as some have done, that he has pushed off his\r\nbark, and is content to leave it to its fate—he does not pretend, with\r\nKent, the author of “Hints to Gentlemen of Landed Property,” that\r\n“these hints are published from no motives of interest whatever”—on the\r\ncontrary he is ready to avow, that, while he would feel it, under a\r\ncertain modification of circumstances, a most agreeable and congenial\r\noccupation of his time, to be employed in establishing a better\r\npractice in the management of Woods, Plantations, &c. he is not in a\r\nposition to be _so_ disinterested as altogether to lose sight of his\r\nown interest in the matter. Further: while he feels it to be an object\r\nof vast importance to the great body of Landed Proprietors, and others,\r\nthat a new system should be laid down and acted upon, the Author wishes\r\nnot to disguise the fact, that he seeks the honourable distinction of\r\nbeing permitted to assist in correcting the evils, which he thinks he\r\nmay have been the first so strongly to point out.\r\n\r\nThe Author cannot but hope that he has proved all that can be fairly\r\nconsidered _as implied_ in his Title; and if he have done so, it may be\r\nproductive of much advantage to those who possess property in Woods,\r\n&c.: their attention being once strongly called to the subject, they\r\ncannot fail to perceive that there is plenty for them to do.\r\n\r\nThe Author needs not to be told, for of that he is quite conscious—that\r\nhis book is very defective in arrangement, and faulty in style,\r\nbut if he have succeeded in the attempt to be tolerably “plain and\r\nperspicuous,” and “not very ungrammatical,” that is as much, perhaps,\r\nas ought to be required of a practical man.\r\n\r\nOne word is necessary here, with reference to Sir H. Steuart, whose\r\nname, as a Planter, the Author has mentioned at page 58. He wishes to\r\ncorrect an impression which he may have produced, that the honourable\r\nBaronet is altogether opposed to the practice of preparing the soil\r\nprevious to planting. This is not the case; but Sir Henry, with\r\nsingular inconsistency, after speaking in the highest terms in favour\r\nof trenching, manuring, &c. declares the practice to be inapplicable\r\nto Plantations on a large scale. It is unnecessary to remark here, that\r\non this point the Author is of a different opinion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S. The Author reviews neglected Woods, Plantations, &c. and gives\r\ndirections for their proper management, or he would contract with any\r\nNoblemen or Gentlemen to overlook their Woods, &c. at so much per acre\r\nper year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing the few “PLAIN REMARKS” which follow, I shall, in a great\r\nmeasure, confine myself to the consideration of two main points,\r\nviz.—the _present state_, and the _present mode of managing_ such\r\nOld Woods, Plantations, and Hedge-Row Timber, as I deem to be under\r\na course of improper treatment, suggesting, as I go on, an improved\r\nsystem of management of them all. Respecting both these points, I shall\r\nhave to make statements which, to me, appear very important—statements,\r\nwhich I know cannot be controverted,—and which, though they may apply,\r\nas they are intended to apply, more particularly to some districts than\r\nto others, will, more or less, apply to all where Woods, Plantations,\r\nand well-stocked Hedge-Rows abound.\r\n\r\nUpon the second point in particular,—I mean the present modes of\r\nmanaging property of this description,—I shall endeavour to show\r\nin what respects, and, as well as I am able, to what extent, it is\r\nerroneous or defective.\r\n\r\nBut first, I would remark generally, that although the treatment of\r\nPlantations is bad enough, it is not so grossly bad as is that of\r\nAncient Woods and Hedge-Row Timber. I have, for some time, had it in\r\nmy mind to write respecting the two latter, having been long convinced\r\nthat a most extensive waste of property, and loss of time, was going\r\non, but, until now, I have neither had leisure to prepare for, nor\r\nconfidence to submit to, a “discerning public,” those views which have\r\nbeen matured during an eighteen years observation and experience.\r\n\r\nI have now, however, resolved to print, and whatever may be the precise\r\nresult to myself, if, by means of this publication, the attention of\r\nNoblemen and Gentlemen is drawn only to one hundredth part of their\r\n_neglected_ Woods and Plantations, and of their _abused Hedge-Rows_,\r\nso as to induce them immediately to determine to arrest the progress\r\nof the mischief that is going on, and not only to commence the work\r\nof improvement, but to proceed to the necessary extent in carrying it\r\non, two most important results, _at least_, will be produced; viz.;\r\nto Proprietors themselves a very considerable present or prospective\r\nadvantage—in some cases both—and a large measure of real benefit to the\r\nLabouring Classes, in the increased demand which will be created for\r\nthe labour of their hands. This last object is so vastly important,\r\nthat an enlightened and benevolent mind will always be ready to listen\r\nto any suggestions that may be thrown out to promote it; but at a\r\nperiod like the present, when one great constitutional change in our\r\ndomestic policy has been made, and when there is too much cause to\r\nfear that another is about to be tried,—each of which is as much _an\r\nexperiment in morals_ as any thing else,—it is invested with a much\r\nhigher claim on the attention of those to whom the appeal may be made,\r\nthan in ordinary circumstances it would be.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen that I refer to the new Poor Law and to the\r\nCorn Laws; the former of which throws the poor man almost exclusively\r\non his own resources. To provide him therefore with _healthful\r\nemployment_, at such a time, and under such circumstances, will tend\r\nmore than any thing else can do, to lessen the difficulty and danger of\r\nthe transition from the old to the new law, and to mitigate the perhaps\r\nnecessary severity of the provisions of the latter.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed any further I would state, that I shall not attempt\r\nany thing like a systematic course, nor shall I confine myself to a\r\nscientific arrangement of my subjects: nor again, shall I trouble\r\nmyself about the _technical_ names of the several Trees which I may\r\nhave to mention: nor, lastly, is it my intention to aim at elegance\r\nof composition. I do not write to establish a literary reputation,\r\nwell knowing that to such an object I am unequal, and that if it\r\nwere otherwise, there is a _want of adaptation_ in my subject; but I\r\nwish to be understood as addressing myself to those who, not being\r\nthemselves _practically_ acquainted with the subjects here treated\r\nof, are not unwilling to listen to the opinions which I have formed,\r\nand profit by the experience which I have derived from close and\r\nextensive observation, while myself actually employed in the details\r\nof management, connected alike with the Timber and Coppice of ancient\r\nWoods, with the planting and subsequent treatment of Plantations and\r\nwith Hedge-Row Timber.\r\n\r\nOf course I am aware that much has been said, and much has been\r\nwritten, by others who have preceded me, on these subjects, but\r\nnotwithstanding that this be true, I am not at all of opinion that this\r\nbranch of rural economy has received its fair share of attention, or\r\nthat the subject has been viewed in that particular aspect in which it\r\nis here presented, highly important and interesting as that view must\r\nbe acknowledged to be, when considered as it affects the growers of\r\nTimber, the labouring poor, and the community at large.\r\n\r\nThere will be many, doubtless, who will dissent from some of my\r\nopinions. They will have a good and sufficient cause to do so, if they\r\nadjudge them to be erroneous: they have just as much right to hold\r\ntheir opinions as I have to hold mine, but I wish it to be always\r\nremembered by those who may read the following pages, that every\r\nconclusion to which I have been brought, and every inference that I\r\nhave drawn, _has had its origin in actual experience_.\r\n\r\nTo practical men, and more particularly still, to such practical men\r\nas are like myself—to use a homely phrase—more at home in a Wood or\r\nPlantation than any where else—I need not make more than a general\r\nreference to what they daily see, in proof of the “mismanagement”\r\nwhich I intend to show, but as to the Proprietors it surely must be\r\notherwise. They cannot, one would suppose, be at all aware of the\r\nfact, that one part, and that a most interesting and valuable part, of\r\ntheir property, is so _mismanaged_ as to call loudly for an immediate\r\nremedy! I affirm, however, without hesitation, that while _Agriculture_\r\nhas made rapid strides in the march of improvement, and while that\r\nfirst of all improvements in Agriculture, _Draining_—(although as yet\r\nbut very imperfectly understood, and, in a very serious number of\r\ncases, _very ill done_)—has been extensively attended to—while the\r\nadaptation of Manures (although science has yet much to do, and much\r\nto teach us, on this point) has been carried to such an extent, as\r\nis unparalleled in any age, and almost in any country but our own;\r\nand withal so successfully, as to turn barren and hitherto sterile\r\nWastes, Forests, and Moors, into productive occupations—while such an\r\nextraordinary degree of ingenuity has been applied to the invention and\r\npractical working of different implements, as to render the operations\r\nof husbandry comparatively simple and easy—and while yet once more,\r\nthe attention which has been paid to the breeding and rearing of the\r\nvarious kinds of Stock, has raised them to a pitch of excellence which\r\nour forefathers never contemplated, and which scarcely leaves any room\r\nfor further effort—while all this proves, I say, that the large landed\r\nProprietors of this country, stimulated and assisted by the skill of\r\nthe man of science, and by the enterprize and persevering efforts of\r\nthe Tenant Farmer, have paid _almost_ adequate attention to one part\r\nof their estates, it is equally undeniable that the present condition\r\nof _a large proportion_ of the Woods, Hedge-Rows, and Plantations,\r\nfurnishes proof of the grossest neglect, and a perfectly unaccountable\r\nwant of attention. To point out wherein this neglect consists, and to\r\nprove this want of attention, will be the object of the following\r\n“Remarks.”\r\n\r\nIt is really surprising that in an age like this, when there is\r\nan onward movement in almost everything else, such instances of\r\n“mismanagement” of Woods, &c. should every where meet the eye. If any\r\none well acquainted with the subject, were to take horse and ride\r\nthrough every county of the kingdom, he would find in ninety cases out\r\nof a hundred, the Old Woods especially, to be in as bad a condition as\r\nif they were solely intended for fox or game covers, and incapable of\r\nbeing turned to any other use. They are permitted to continue precisely\r\nin the same uncultivated state in which their present possessors found\r\nthem, Gentlemen too often totally overlooking the important fact, that\r\nwhile they might, by proper attention to the draining and improvement\r\nof their Woods, and the best mode of disposing of the produce, give\r\nemployment to a very considerable number of their poor dependents;\r\nincrease the present revenue, and lay the foundation of a greatly\r\nimproved permanent income from them, they would, to a very small\r\nextent, if at all, injure the covers for sporting purposes.\r\n\r\nAs to Plantations, the treatment may be said to be somewhat better,\r\nbut, as I have before said, in most cases it is bad enough, as I shall\r\nhereafter show.\r\n\r\nOf the Hedge-Rows I affirm, that they are, very generally, either left\r\nentirely to themselves, or to the tender mercies of the occupiers of\r\nthe soil, who, having no interest in their success, but rather the\r\ncontrary, cannot, of course, be expected to exercise any care in their\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly introduced the various subjects which it is my\r\nintention to notice more fully under separate and distinct heads, I\r\nshall commence my first chapter with “Ancient Woods.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\nANCIENT WOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile professionally employed, and while passing from one part of the\r\ncountry to another, my surprise has often been great, when I have\r\nwitnessed, from its effects, the indifference which many gentlemen\r\nmanifest, as to the state and management of this description of\r\nproperty: there appears, in comparatively few instances, to be any\r\nthing worth the name of an effort to rescue them from that state of\r\nwild unproductiveness in which they have been for ages! One generation\r\npasses away after another, and like as was the father, so is the\r\nson—and as was the agent of the former, so is the agent of the latter!\r\nAll they have done for ages gone by, they do now, and little or nothing\r\nmore. They calculate, with tolerable accuracy, the return of the year,\r\nwhen, according to immemorial custom, they ought to “cut, and hack, and\r\nhew,” and they go into the wood for the purpose of _setting out_ the\r\npiece which they intend to fell: this they divide, in many districts,\r\ninto a certain number of lots, or ranges, of what they call “Gad Wood,”\r\nwhich vary considerably in size, but which, as far as they go, include\r\n_all_ the Underwood. At the same time, the sapient woodman contrives to\r\nsatisfy himself—and it is seldom that his superiors make any inquiry\r\ninto the matter—as to the number of _Oak Trees_, &c. that it is proper\r\nto take down; and then, after due notice given, the whole is sold,\r\nUnderwood and all, by Auction.\r\n\r\nIt is a common practice to describe a _ring_ round a portion of the\r\nStandard Trees which are to remain—such as the Oak, Ash, &c.—and these,\r\nof course, are intended for future timber, the selection being often\r\nas bad as it well can be, but the whole system, from the beginning to\r\nthe end, is most objectionable, and it is matter of astonishment that\r\nit should have continued so long. It is objectionable for many reasons,\r\namong which I mention the following: viz.: because the Proprietor\r\nthrows out of his own hands that _control_ which a gentleman ought to\r\nhave over every person who enters his woods, whether as a purchaser or\r\nas a workman. This control is absolutely necessary in order to secure\r\ntwo things, for which Conditions of Sale, however well they may be\r\ndrawn up, offer but a very feeble security—I mean _the prevention of\r\nentry by teams, &c. at an improper season, and the clearing of the\r\nWoods at a given time_. There are other reasons which apply more or\r\nless strongly, according to the condition of the wood, _as to its\r\nstock, and the staple of its soil_. Carting, or rather _teaming_, for\r\ncarts are not often used, will inevitably do much injury in woods that\r\nare _well stocked, if the utmost possible care is not taken, whatever\r\nthe soil may be_; but if it be a _tenacious, retentive, cold, clay_,\r\ndamage would be done in two ways: viz.: in the poaching of the land,\r\nand in that which would be done to the _stock_ by the _wheels_. The\r\ninjury to which woods are liable from these two causes, and others, may\r\nbe almost wholly prevented by the active supervision of an intelligent\r\nwoodman. Such a person will take care to divide his cuttings as\r\nnearly as he can to suit the local demand, and to begin _as early\r\nas possible_, so that every opportunity may be seized, in _suitable\r\nweather_, for getting away the produce, and it must be his own personal\r\nduty to see that no _avoidable_ injury is done to the stools by the\r\ncarriages. These reasons appear to me to be quite sufficient to\r\nestablish a decided preference for the mode which I recommend over\r\nthe system to which I have referred; but there is another, which I\r\ncannot but think will be deemed of importance enough by itself to\r\ndecide the question, and it is this: viz.: _the impossibility of\r\ndeciding, before the Underwood is cut_, what Oak Trees _ought_, or\r\n_ought not_, to come down. It is quite possible, I admit, to jump to a\r\n_conclusion_ on the subject: to deny this in the face of the evidence\r\nwhich every succeeding Winter affords, would be absurd; but I affirm\r\nthat no woodman can do it _correctly_. He ought, at least, to have a\r\n_clear coast_, to enable him to give due consideration to the various\r\npoints on which he should be fully satisfied, before he cuts down that,\r\nwhich his whole life would not suffice to set up again. How little\r\nconsideration enters into these matters, it is easy for those who\r\nreally understand them to judge. For my own part, I am compelled to\r\nsay, that I never yet saw a single instance, where timber was selected\r\nin the way to which I refer, without gross blunders being committed.\r\nBut more than this may be affirmed—and it is not an over-weening\r\nfondness for my own plans, but a perfect conviction of the _utter want\r\nof adaptation_ in the present practice of many, which induces me to say\r\nit—there is not _one solitary argument that can be advanced in favour\r\nof the practice which I have condemned_. If this be so, then let all\r\ngentlemen abandon it; if not, let the arguments be brought forward.\r\n\r\nI have said that the whole system is wrong, and I add, that no good\r\nwill be done by a patchwork attempt to amend it. So long, for instance,\r\nas a proprietor retains the “Gad-Wood” plan, he will insure the\r\ncontinuance of the old system of “mismanagement.” He might as well\r\nthink of bending, by his own personal strength, one of the sturdy stems\r\nof his well-grown oaks, as attempt to turn his woodman gently aside\r\nout of his usual track—especially if he be an old man—there must be a\r\ntotal revolution effected—he must be put into an entirely new course,\r\nif either the condition of the woods, or the revenue arising from them,\r\nis to be improved.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it seldom happens that customers are not found for all\r\nthat may be offered, in almost any neighbourhood, and in any way. I\r\nsay unfortunately, inasmuch as it keeps the managers of many woods\r\nexactly _stationary_, while everybody else is going on. If they had a\r\nlittle difficulty to contend with, it might, perhaps, induce a _little_\r\nreflection, and raise a doubt in their minds as to the propriety of\r\nthe course they were pursuing; which would be a great point gained, as\r\nthere has been _very little thought_ applied to the management of this\r\nspecies of property, either by its owners, or by the persons they have\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, many refreshing instances of good management to\r\nbe met with—I could myself mention a few, were it not invidious to do\r\nso—but in a large majority of cases, from mistaken management, woods\r\nare in a high degree, and for many reasons, a discredit to those who\r\nbelong to them. If the Woodman’s account were fairly examined—if a\r\n_Dr._ and _Cr._ balance sheet were exhibited, it would be found that\r\nthe land was paying _a very small rent indeed from the underwood, even\r\nwhere there might be very little oak_, which most assuredly ought not\r\nto be the case; for I contend that there is no Ancient Woodland which\r\nis not considerably below the average quality of what I have seen, that\r\nis not quite capable of _growing a full crop_—either of underwood or of\r\noak; and for this plain reason, viz.; because _the period of pecuniary\r\nsacrifice, the infancy of the wood_, is gone by: and that woodman’s\r\nmanagement is essentially defective, who cannot show, upon _every_ acre\r\nunder his care, a good crop either of the one or the other. I would\r\nhere remark, that a _full crop of both_ cannot contemporaneously grow\r\nup together; and this consideration is of far more importance in the\r\nmanagement of woods than is at first sight imagined, or, than by a\r\nslight acquaintance with the subject would be perceived.\r\n\r\nIf there is found in a wood a superabundance of oaks, and if they are\r\nseen to be _thrifty_, nothing could possibly be so _ill judged_ as\r\nto _thin them too freely_, even though the _crop of underwood were\r\nentirely sacrificed_; for, the very objects most to be desired, can\r\nonly be attained by bringing about that state of things which is\r\nhere supposed, and which necessarily involves _the sacrifice of the\r\nunderwood_, or, at the least, all idea of any considerable _profit_\r\nfrom it. Under these circumstances, the exertions of the skilful\r\nWoodman will be directed to the securing of _great length of bole\r\nor stem_; for these, and these alone, are the trees which have any\r\nlegitimate right to a place in a wood: and, of course, the longer their\r\nboles are, the better.\r\n\r\nHaving attained this object, the woodman will then anxiously employ the\r\nbest means in his power, for encouraging the growth of the underwood,\r\nso far as, at least, to _keep it alive_, and _as healthy_ as possible;\r\nand if he have well considered the subject, he will have contrived to\r\nlay down a plan, a regularly systematic plan, that his successors can\r\nneither mistake, nor, without some good reason, depart from, by which,\r\nduring the period that the crop of oaks is being taken, the stock of\r\nunderwood shall gradually be acquiring strength and vigour, and getting\r\nwell hold of the soil; as well as that, they shall be so equally\r\ndiffused over it, as fully and beneficially to occupy the ground, _when\r\nthe oaks are all gone_. All these calculations, and many more, which\r\nit is impossible to enumerate, will suggest themselves to the mind of\r\na man well-skilled in the management of woods; but there are very few\r\nindeed, who either see the necessity of making, or will give themselves\r\nthe trouble to make, any calculations at all. In the oversight of\r\nwoods, &c. much more is included than is generally supposed. He who\r\nimagines, as too many do, that when woods have been cut, they may be\r\nsafely left to themselves; and that when the period comes round again\r\nfor felling, they will do all that could be expected from them, has a\r\nvery imperfect knowledge of the subject, or, rather, no knowledge at\r\nall: and further; he who does not know that woods will ultimately pay\r\nwell for the highest degree of care, attention, and culture, is not a\r\nfitting person to have the oversight of them. But such is the ignorance\r\non the part of many, who call themselves woodmen, and the carelessness\r\nof their employers, that there is a total negation of _forethought_ and\r\n_calculation_, instead of every step that is taken having reference to\r\na remote period.\r\n\r\nA nobleman, or gentleman, or his agent, may calculate what will be the\r\neffect upon a farm at the expiration of a lease of twenty-one years,\r\nif it be not cultivated as it ought to be, and, by introducing certain\r\nclauses into the lease, he may secure himself against the certain and\r\nserious loss which would accrue to him from bad management; and he who\r\ndoes not so calculate, has a very inadequate idea of the nature of the\r\ncontract which he is about to make; but the man who takes upon himself\r\nthe management of woods, and whose views and plans are not extended\r\nover _several of those cycles of time which intervene between the\r\nseasons of cutting_, does not rightly comprehend the peculiar duties\r\nwhich he has undertaken to perform, and ought, at once, to be relieved\r\nfrom them, and provided for in some other way; for if woods are worth\r\nhaving at all, they are worth looking after, and _if they will pay for\r\nproper culture_, which no one who understands the subject will deny,\r\nthey ought to receive it, for various weighty reasons, which have been\r\nbefore adverted to.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks will apply, of course, most directly, to woods\r\nwhere there is an _apparent redundancy_ of oak. I will now suppose the\r\ncase of a wood where there is a _deficiency_, or little or no oak. Here\r\nthere ought, unquestionably, to be _a full crop of underwood_. This\r\nunderwood ought to be adapted, as to _kind_, first, to the nature of\r\nthe soil; and, secondly, to the _local demand, if the local demand be\r\ngood_: and as to its _age_, of course it must be that which best suits\r\nthe market, or when, comparatively, it will fetch the best price; so\r\nthat in some districts, as in Kent, for instance, it will _sell_ best,\r\nand therefore ought to be _cut_, at about twelve years of age: in\r\nothers it would not sell so well at less than from fifteen to twenty\r\nyears old. But it does _not_ follow as a matter of course, that because\r\na wood has always, previously, stood from twenty to twenty-five years,\r\nit should for ever continue to do so; on the contrary, I should say,\r\nthat there are _very few woods indeed, if any_, which ought to stand\r\nmore than twenty years, and a great proportion of them, nothing like so\r\nlong. The great reason why the produce of woods does not earlier come\r\nto maturity, is the gross “mismanagement” to which they are subjected:\r\nbut when the time shall arrive that they shall be deemed worthy of as\r\nmuch “care, attention, and culture,” as any other part of an estate,\r\nthen will they be found, probably, to yield quite as good a return for\r\nit; and the present _no system_ management will be exploded.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where the cycle has run beyond twenty years, it will, at\r\nleast, be well for the proprietor, or his manager, to sit down and\r\ncalculate whether the stuff would not pay better if felled some years\r\nearlier. The inquiry can do no harm; and much good may possibly arise\r\nout of it. In the case last supposed, viz.: a wood with little or\r\nno oak, _and well stocked with underwood of a suitable kind_, there\r\ncannot be a doubt upon the subject; for if the stock—by which term I\r\nmean the shoots which have sprung up from the stools—has been properly\r\ntreated, it will have arrived, in twenty years, at a size quite large\r\nenough for agricultural uses, and it can very seldom be allowed to\r\nstand longer without _serious injury to the stools_. A very little\r\nconsideration will convince any one, who does not resist conviction,\r\nthat such ought to be the state of a wood so circumstanced as to oak;\r\nbut nevertheless the actual condition of most woods is widely different\r\nfrom this: instead of there being a full crop of underwood, where there\r\nis a deficiency of timber, or a full crop of timber, where there is\r\nlittle or no underwood, it too frequently happens that there is neither\r\nthe one nor the other, even on land which is, as was remarked before,\r\ncapable of yielding a handsome revenue! And here let it not be supposed\r\nthat I am speaking of _extreme cases only_, or that there are but _few_\r\nwoods in this state: the cases are numerous: I have seen, and could\r\npoint out many, but this I shall not do: I rather choose to leave these\r\nobservations with “all whom they may concern,” to work conviction where\r\nthey are seen to be _just_, quite indifferent as to the effect which\r\nthey may produce on the minds of any who may oppose them.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me ask—_if this be the state of many woods—if neither a\r\ncrop of timber nor of underwood is found—to what is it owing?_ the\r\nreply is not difficult: it is _mainly_ attributable to proprietors\r\nthemselves, and to their agents: to woodmen in a subordinate degree.\r\nIn proof of my first position, I would respectfully remark, that if\r\na gentleman _chooses_ to sacrifice every thing to the idea of having\r\n_good covers_; and, supposing that any thing which interferes with the\r\nprimeval state of his woods, is incompatible with this object, _refuses\r\nto do any thing at them_, the woodman may not bear the blame. Again:\r\nif a proprietor happen, unfortunately, to have _such an aversion to\r\nfelling timber_—and there are many such—that he will sooner let it _rot\r\ndown_, or _allow one tree to destroy another_; or again; suffer the\r\ntimber trees to stand so thickly that they not only totally destroy\r\neach other, but the underwood below also, the woodman ought not to\r\nbe censured; except indeed, he have advised such a course, which I\r\ncan hardly think any man accustomed to woods could do, in the present\r\nday. Once more; if gentlemen lack the moral courage—and I have met\r\nwith _some_ of this description—to treat with the contempt which it\r\ndeserves the vulgar meddling, the idle tattle of those who are ever\r\nready to say, when timber is felled, that the owner’s _poverty_, and\r\nnot his _will_, consents to the deed, we are furnished with abundance\r\nof reasons for the serious waste of property that is going on, but the\r\nwoodman is not in fault, neither ought he to be blamed. Lastly: if\r\nproprietors commit the management of their woods to persons who are\r\nwholly incompetent—as is too often the case—to discharge the duties\r\nconfided to them, I cannot see that the men are to be condemned, but\r\nrather their employers. Wherever such “mismanagement” prevails as I\r\nhave attempted to describe, and have seen so much cause to lament, it\r\nmay generally, I think, be traced, either to ignorance on the part of\r\nwoodmen, or inattention on the part of their employers: but it will\r\nbe quite clear to all, who will allow themselves time to think on the\r\nsubject, that the _grossest_ mismanagement is to be met with, not on\r\nfirst, nor even on second, but on _third_, and _fourth-rate_ estates,\r\nwhere _regular woodmen_ are not kept, and below that grade downwards,\r\nto property which is in the hands of Trustees, or mainly under the\r\ncontrol of Solicitors, or Corporate bodies; or, which is probably worse\r\nthan all, under the supreme direction of men who having, during the\r\nwhole of their business life, had too many Stewardships, &c. _for any\r\nhuman being to look after and manage well_, cannot of course be deemed\r\ncapable of judging rightly on a subject which requires _the closest\r\npossible attention, the nicest discrimination, and an extended and\r\nvaried experience_.\r\n\r\nMuch mischief has also arisen from the employment by gentlemen, and by\r\ntheir agents, of persons, who, while they may, usefully and creditably,\r\nfulfil their duties as village carpenters and the like, cannot possibly\r\npossess those enlarged, comprehensive views, which are necessary to the\r\nproper management of timber generally, and Ancient Woods especially.\r\nI must here protest against the conclusion being drawn, that I am\r\ndoing injustice to any class of men in remarking, as I have done, on\r\ntheir manner of discharging the trust committed to them. As to the\r\nprofessional gentlemen, either their _engagements_, their _position_,\r\nor their _habits_, interpose an insurmountable difficulty, and relieve\r\nthem from the charge of wilful neglect: and as to the others it is no\r\ninjustice to them to affirm, as I do most positively, that there are\r\nprinciples and considerations involved in this subject, which they\r\ncan, in no wise, grasp or comprehend: and so perfectly clear is this\r\nto me, so fully am I borne out by a long course of “observation and\r\nexperience,” that I have never yet seen one solitary instance, where\r\n_the timber taken down in thinning_, either in woods or plantations,\r\n_when in such hands_, has been properly done; and in _very few_ cases\r\nindeed, either here, or higher up the scale, without the most _serious\r\nblunders_. One case has fallen under my observation this Winter,\r\n(1842,) where _oak timber trees were selected and marked for sale,\r\nwhich were exactly, in every respect, such as a good judge would wish\r\nto see in every wood; and not only, not too thick, but, from the same\r\ninjudicious mode of selecting and marking at previous auctions, much\r\ntoo thin_. They were also in a state of _high vigorous health_, and\r\nmoreover, there was no underwood which could be benefited! I admit that\r\nthis was a more flagrant outrage against the principles which ought to\r\nrule in selecting, than is usually committed, but the work is hardly\r\never done as it ought to be.\r\n\r\nBut whatever difference of opinion may arise among practical men, upon\r\nthe points now under consideration, and on whomsoever the blame may\r\nrest, it is unquestionable that the actual state of a large proportion\r\nof our Ancient Woods is very bad indeed: they are either crowded\r\n_with inferior oak timber_, along with the most miserable rubbish as\r\nunderwood; or, if they contain any thing valuable in either the one\r\nor the other, no _principles_, or rules of any kind, are applied in\r\nthe management of them; and, consequently, they are, on some account\r\nor other, and of course more or less rapidly, _passing through the\r\nstage of deterioration_, and are annually losing to their owners, _a\r\nheavy per centage on their value_. In many cases, the oak, from ages\r\nof “mismanagement,” is stunted in growth, and of a _form, and shape,\r\ntotally unsuited to the place where it stands_; and the underwood\r\nconsists of that alone which is indigenous to the soil, and which,\r\ntherefore, no neglect can destroy, nor any culture improve: in addition\r\nto all this, they are often, nay almost always, on clayey, retentive\r\nsoils, _ruined with water_: they are periodically _shut up_, for from\r\neighteen to twenty-five years, during which time, it is impossible to\r\ndo any thing at them; and, when they are cleared of the underwood,\r\ninstead of the opportunity being gratefully seized, for the purpose\r\nof effecting those operations which can only be carried on at such a\r\ntime, they are _shut up again_, and left in their original state—except\r\nindeed they may have been despoiled of some of their oak—nothing\r\nbeing _done at them_, or, if any thing, probably so little, or so\r\n_ill_ done, that no good result is produced. But what ought to be the\r\ncourse pursued at such a time? Why, as it is only during the year of\r\n“hagging,” and the following season, that any work of magnitude, any\r\nimprovement worth mentioning, can be carried on; a proprietor should\r\nmore carefully examine his woods when they have been cut, than he would\r\nany other description of property: he should himself, if he understand\r\nit—which, however, is very seldom the case—or if he do not, by a person\r\nwho is conversant with such matters, make a most rigid, and particular\r\nsurvey, in order to satisfy himself _as to what ought to be done_; and\r\nthis he must do _immediately when the underwood is cut_, or rather, as\r\nsoon as any considerable portion is done, so that he may have before\r\nhim _all the time which he can possibly command_, for carrying on, and\r\ncompleting, his improvements. He must not be deterred from commencing\r\nthem by any consideration of _the remoteness of the prospect of return\r\nupon his outlay_; but, instead of visiting the sins of his fathers upon\r\nthe generations following him, he must, if the case demand it, make a\r\n_present_ sacrifice, for the benefit of his posterity: I say if the\r\ncase _demand_ it, but this will not very frequently happen, as there\r\nare very few instances of “mismanagement” where _the fear of cutting\r\ntimber_ has not been one of the principal causes of that mismanagement;\r\nand where this is so, there is at once found a source from whence may\r\nbe obtained _the means of amply paying for any outlay that may be\r\nrequired_. I have thus far remarked only on what may, and what ought\r\nto be done, when Ancient Woods come to be _felled in the regular\r\nway_, and _at the usual time and age_; but there are vast numbers of\r\ncases where, first, the condition of the woods is so bad, that all\r\nconsiderations about the _usual_ time, are merged in the necessity\r\nfor immediately commencing the work of renovation; and, secondly,\r\nthe instances are not few, where the same course is desirable, in\r\norder that a more profitable way of disposing of the produce may be\r\nintroduced, to supersede the old jog-trot mode of getting rid of it.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first, it will at once be perceived, by a practical\r\neye, and a sound judgment, whether a wood is in such a state, _as to\r\nthe prospect of a crop_, that it is the proprietor’s interest to _make\r\na sacrifice in the underwood_ and _cut it_, although it may sell for\r\nnothing but faggots, _rather than finish, or run out, the term, at\r\nthe end of which it would be cut in the usual course_. I have seen\r\nhundreds of such cases: there are many in almost every neighbourhood\r\nwhere woods exist at all; and I confidently ask, what would be the use,\r\nor how would it be possible to show the propriety, of completing the\r\nterm of the cycle, if, first, _the wood contained nothing valuable as\r\nunderwood_; and if, secondly, _it contained a considerable portion of\r\ntimber that required immediate attention_, on some account or other?\r\nI should, for instance, instantly determine to cut, where I found a\r\nwood crowded with a class of unhealthy oaks, or other timber: but it\r\nis not necessary to particularize, as I would not pretend to give such\r\ndirections here as would enable a gentleman to decide, for that could\r\nonly be done _after inspection_. So many points have to be considered,\r\nthat a careful survey of a wood must be made. This done, fortunately\r\nthere is no difficulty in coming to a correct conclusion upon such a\r\nquestion as this. A practical man, who understands what he is about,\r\nwill be in no danger of committing an error in the decision to which\r\nhe will be led, for these are not subjects on which a difference of\r\nopinion might naturally arise upon an examination taken. The various\r\nconsiderations for _cutting_, or _forbearing to cut_, would _so\r\ncertainly present themselves_ to the mind of a person _really competent\r\nto judge_, that I should say there would be no doubt whatever, of his\r\ndeciding correctly, if he were not interfered with by the personal\r\nwish, or taste, of his employer. It is with this as with most other\r\nsubjects:—wherever men understand what they are about, and are guided\r\nand governed by _fixed principles_, matters go on well; but the\r\nmisfortune, with regard to woods, is, that ages of “mismanagement,” and\r\nother causes, interpose obstacles and difficulties which it will be\r\nno slight task to overcome. To give a brief summary of my views upon\r\nthis important point, I would remark, that no wood ought to be allowed\r\nto _run out its term_ which is not _stocked as it ought to be_, or\r\nwhich, if stocked tolerably well, _is suffering injury from imperfect\r\ndrainage_. As I have just said, these points must be determined by an\r\nexamination of the wood by some person whose judgment may be relied\r\nupon; but any gentleman may see at once, if he will, that if a wood is\r\nreally in the state which I have supposed, viz., without either timber\r\nor underwood _worth standing_, &c. it would be perfectly absurd to _let\r\nit stand_; for at the end of the cycle it would be very little better\r\nthan at the beginning, and so much more time would be irrecoverably\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nAs to the second point—_the improvement of revenue to be derived from a\r\ndifferent mode of disposing of the produce_, I am of opinion that much\r\nmight be done, in many places, without laying an increased tax on the\r\nlocal buyers, who are generally either farmers, or their tradesmen, the\r\nwheelwrights and carpenters of every neighbourhood, and who already pay\r\nquite enough for what they get; and especially the _former_, to whom I\r\nwould much sooner recommend their landlords to allow an _abatement_,\r\nas an encouragement to them to keep their fences, gates, &c. in good\r\norder, than any thing in the shape of an advance. But still, much may\r\nbe done to increase the returns from woodland property, by an improved\r\nsystem of management, and, first, I should advise _a careful assortment\r\nof the stuff after it is felled_: I would here, as in every thing\r\nelse, _classify_, by which means, the different kinds, as well as the\r\ndifferent sizes, and shapes, will come into the hands of such persons\r\nas they may exactly suit, instead of jumbling all sorts together, so\r\nthat a buyer is obliged to purchase that which he _does not want_, in\r\norder to come at another portion of the same lot which he is desirous\r\nof having.\r\n\r\nSecondly: There is room to doubt, I think, as hinted before, whether\r\nmistakes are not often made, in not adapting the produce of woods\r\nbetter as to its _age_, both to the local demand, and the interests of\r\nthe proprietor.\r\n\r\nThirdly: So numerous are the facilities in the present day, to what\r\nthey used to be, for the transmission of produce of every kind from one\r\nplace to another, and so many demands have, by commercial enterprize,\r\nbeen opened out, which were altogether unknown a quarter of a century\r\nago, that it may, even as to heavy produce, like that of woods, be\r\nalways questioned, _when the demand is slack, and when prices are low,\r\nwhether the local market be indeed the best market_, or whether the\r\nproduce may not be much better disposed of in some other way. That\r\nthis sometimes occurs, I can prove from my own experience in many\r\ncases, but I will mention only one, which was that of an Ancient Wood,\r\na twentieth portion of which was felled every year, and in which,\r\nfrom “mismanagement,” a large quantity of the stuff was annually left\r\nunsold, but where, after the introduction of a better system, the whole\r\nwas disposed of without difficulty.\r\n\r\nFourthly: A great increase of revenue may be derived from _a better\r\nmode of managing the stock_, both of timber and underwood: the latter\r\nmay, by timely and judicious pruning, by a proper attention to\r\ndraining, &c. _be brought to maturity_ at a much earlier period than it\r\nhas hitherto been done in many places, and thus, of course, be made to\r\nreturn a greater rent.\r\n\r\nIt is incredible how little is done to Ancient Woods compared with\r\nwhat ought to be done, _in the way of draining, pruning, stubbing\r\nup rubbish_, and _filling up with young plants_; although it is\r\nmanifest that, whenever a wood is opened, these important operations\r\n_should_ claim the very particular attention of the proprietor or his\r\nwoodman. But they do not receive it; and hence one cannot wonder at\r\nthe _stunted, unhealthy_ appearance, which many woods exhibit. They\r\nare almost always without any _effective drainage_, it being generally\r\nthought quite sufficient to open out a few paltry drains, which the\r\nfalling leaves of the first Autumn will _choke_ up. It will indeed very\r\nseldom be found, that even the outside ditches are well looked after:\r\nwhereas it should always be the anxious concern of the woodman to\r\nprovide, as well as he possibly can, for the _effectual drainage_ of\r\na wood after being felled, not only during a year or two, but for the\r\nterm of the whole cycle. Of course I am aware that the leaves _must_\r\nfall, and, consequently, that the free egress of the water must, in\r\nsome degree, be _impeded_, but, nevertheless, it is in the power of\r\nthe woodman to provide, in a great measure, if not wholly, against\r\nthis contingency, by making a sufficient number of ditches, of _ample\r\ncapacity_, and by putting them in the best direction. But instead of\r\nthis, it will very rarely be found, as I have just now said, that even\r\nthe outside ditches are properly attended to. The consequence is,\r\nthat the _oaks_, and our best underwood, the ash, not liking too much\r\nmoisture, become diseased, and make comparatively slow progress: in\r\nfact, their _existence_ is shortened by it, as the former will be found\r\nupon cold clay land, having a strong subsoil, to be very stunted and\r\nsickly in their appearance, and ultimately to die at the top, when, of\r\ncourse, they must be cut down; while the latter will much sooner become\r\nhollow, and they too, will finally perish. A small outlay in draining,\r\nif judiciously expended, would, in most cases, prevent these effects,\r\nand as it would only require to be done once in fifteen or twenty\r\nyears, it could not lay more than a trifling charge upon the land.\r\n\r\nPruning is also a very necessary operation in Ancient Woods, both of\r\nthe oak and of the underwood. I shall not here enter upon an inquiry\r\ninto _the general question of pruning_, but, continuing to treat my\r\nsubject practically, venture to remark, that, as our woods are now\r\ncircumstanced, pruning, of some kind or other, is, as far as the\r\noak is concerned, quite _indispensable_. Whether it should be by\r\n_fore-shortening_, _close pruning_, or some other method, must be\r\ndetermined upon an examination taken, but I do not hesitate to express\r\nmy belief, that _the pruning of oak trees in woods_, may be almost\r\nwholly dispensed with, after the few first years, _if they are well\r\ntrained from the beginning_; but that being the case with very few,\r\npruning _must_ be resorted to. And as to the underwood, the question\r\nhas still less difficulty in it. When a wood is well stocked with\r\nunderwood of the right sort, the object to be aimed at by the woodman\r\nis _to bring it to maturity as soon as possible_, and one means which\r\nhe possesses, if he will make use of it, is _pruning_; which he should\r\ncommence, after one year’s growth, and occasionally repeat—say on\r\nthe fourth and sixth years, allowing the intervals to pass without\r\ninterfering with it. If this operation be performed as it ought to be,\r\nthe stools will have a number of poles proportioned to their size and\r\ncapacity of supporting them, and the poles themselves will not only be\r\nmore of an uniform size, but they will be much straighter, and on every\r\naccount better adapted to the use for which they may be intended. But\r\nif a wood be stocked with nothing but rubbish, such as hazel, birch,\r\nalder, &c. it will not be _worth_ pruning, and the best course to take\r\nwith it, would be to _stub it up_, and get rid of it altogether.\r\n\r\nFinally, on this point, and more particularly with reference to timber,\r\nif the pruning be _judiciously done_, it will tend greatly to improve\r\nthe health of the wood, but _the indiscriminate_ use of the pruning\r\nknife might do much harm, it should, therefore, only be done under the\r\nmost careful direction.\r\n\r\n_Stubbing up rubbish_, such as _thorns_, _briers_, _birch_, and, in\r\nmany places, _hazel_, is much to be recommended, as by this means,\r\nlight and air will be admitted more freely, and the health of the wood\r\npromoted, and, of course, its growth facilitated. It is perhaps just\r\npossible, that there may be a few cases where the demand may be such\r\nfor birch, hazel, or alder, as to warrant a woodman in keeping them as\r\na part of his stock; but I have generally found, upon inquiry, that\r\nthey have fetched such a miserable price, as to yield very little more\r\nthan would pay expences.\r\n\r\n_The absolute necessity of filling up with young plants_ must be\r\nuniversally admitted, although _in practice_, it is very rarely done,\r\nor, if done at all, it is very generally so ill done, as to produce no\r\nperceptible improvement in the stock.\r\n\r\nIt too often happens that sufficient care is not bestowed in _selecting\r\nthe plants_. They are frequently put in _too small_, and when they\r\nare long enough, they are often _deficient in thickness_. All plants\r\nput into old woods, should be of _good size_, _stiff_, and _well\r\nrooted_. Again: it will be admitted, that they are often planted in\r\na most slovenly and careless manner.—The following is a specimen of\r\nwhat I have _seen_. The workman takes his spade, and inserts it in\r\nthe ground as far as it will go, _in a sloping direction_; he then\r\nraises it to a _perpendicular position_, which, of course, produces a\r\n“_nick_,” into which he _thrusts the plant_, and having put his heavy\r\nfoot upon it, there and thus, he leaves it to its fate, and pursues his\r\nill-directed labour, without a gleam of light breaking in upon him, as\r\nto the possibility of his being more usefully employed, or doing his\r\nwork in a more effective manner! In this way, or in some such way as\r\nthis, thousands of acres of Ancient Woods are treated every year; but\r\nit must be clear to every one, that such a practice is a disgrace to\r\nthose who pursue it. If the workmen are asked their opinion of it, they\r\nwill, in most cases, assure you, that the plants will “_all grow_,”\r\nbut the misfortune is, that _experience_ is against them. Both theory\r\nand practice are directly opposed to their view. But independently of\r\nfacts, which every where condemn such methods, no one acquainted with\r\nthe _rudiments_ of the subject, needs to be told, that it is utterly\r\nunlikely that either an oak or an ash plant should grow, under the\r\nmanifest disadvantages in which it is placed, when its roots are thus\r\n_jumbled together_, and forced into a “_nick_” fit only for a willow\r\nset; and when, moreover, it has to commence its course in competition\r\nwith other underwood, which has already possession of the ground. It is\r\nabsurd to suppose that it should succeed.\r\n\r\nI do not presume to say that some woods do not receive different\r\ntreatment, in _all_ respects, to that which I have denounced: that\r\nwould not be true; but these are the exceptions, and even where the\r\nmanagement is best, there is much to complain of.\r\n\r\nIn commencing the subject of Planting, I am impressed with a sense of\r\nthe importance which should be attached to it in such a work as this.\r\nI mean planting by way of filling up, in Ancient Woods. I am quite\r\naware that it demands such a largeness and comprehension of view, that\r\nit might well be supposed likely to discourage one of stouter nerves\r\nthan mine. It is important because, first, every wood in the kingdom\r\nought to be _well planted_, whether it is or not: It is so, secondly,\r\nbecause there are very few that are properly planted.\r\n\r\nAs I have stated before, the infancy of a wood, or plantation, is the\r\nonly time when it cannot be expected to pay. After it has arrived at\r\na certain age, say from fifteen to twenty years, it ought to begin to\r\nmake _some_ return. In woods, if they are properly planted, it will\r\nnecessarily be small during the first two cycles of twenty years each.\r\nIt must be observed, that I am here speaking of the first forty years\r\nof an _Ancient_ Wood, supposing it to have been thoroughly purged\r\nof its rubbish, retaining all the valuable stock, and to have been\r\nre-planted. The return must be small, because the oaks will have been\r\nplanted thickly, in order that they may acquire great length of bole:\r\nand this being the case, whatever underwood may have been put in, it\r\nwill be treated with direct reference to the health and prosperity of\r\nthe entire class of timber trees. After the expiration of the first\r\ncycle, that portion of the stuff put in for underwood will be cut\r\nover, and such pruning of the oak as may be required (which will be\r\nvery slight) will be done, care being taken never to lose sight of\r\nthe principle of _classification of the oaks, into certain families of\r\nlarger or smaller size, according to the term which a skilful woodman\r\nwill allot for their entire existence_. This is of immense consequence,\r\nand will embrace calculations, and a knowledge of the habits of trees,\r\nwhich can only be acquired by “close observation and long experience.”\r\nWhere a sufficient number of oaks have been introduced, the _underwood_\r\nwill yield very little return per acre, even at the end of the second\r\ncycle; but if the wood has been well managed, it will have been kept\r\nalive and tolerably healthy; and when it is cut, at the end of forty\r\nyears, a considerable number of oaks of a useful size for farmers,\r\nwheelwrights, &c. will be taken down: this will admit light and air,\r\nand in a slight degree, perhaps, improve the position of the underwood\r\nduring the course of the third cycle.\r\n\r\nI need not pursue the subject farther here, having, I trust, succeeded\r\nin opening to the reader a general view of the plan which should be\r\npursued. But there are other woods where a larger portion, both of\r\noak and of underwood, will be found, and where, consequently, it\r\nwill be more the object of the woodman to improve by _less extensive\r\nmeasures_ than would be adopted in such a case as the one just\r\nreferred to. It will mostly be best to do this by pruning, stubbing,\r\nand planting—always supposing that an effectual drainage has been\r\nsecured—and here I would remark, that whenever planting is done in a\r\nwood, it should be as well done as circumstances will possibly allow.\r\nInstead of the “nick” system, or any similar plan, the woodman should\r\ndig holes for the underwood in the Autumn, and plant in February, or\r\nearly in March. For oak, he should dig a larger hole, in the Autumn,\r\ngive it a Summer fallow, and put in a vigorous, stiff plant, the\r\nAutumn following, or in the February next but one. If some such plan\r\nas this were pursued, there is not much fear but the plants would\r\ngrow, and in this way woods may be gradually brought into a prosperous\r\nstate, instead of their being, as they now are, in the aggregate, a\r\n_comparatively_ valueless property to their owners.\r\n\r\nI may here illustrate my view by a reference to a particular case,\r\nwhich came under my professional notice. It was a wood held on lease\r\nby a gentleman, under an ecclesiastical body, the lease being for a\r\ncertain number of years, renewable upon the payment of a fine every\r\nseven years. Some dissatisfaction was felt by the lessee at the\r\namount of the fines demanded, and the lease was permitted to _lapse_,\r\nat which time the intrinsic value of the stock, whether of timber\r\nor _underwood_, was literally nothing. The oak was all gone, as it\r\nwas quite natural that, with a lease so framed, it should be, and\r\nthe underwood, instead of being usefully and beneficially occupying\r\nthe ground, of which it then had _entire possession_, was not worth\r\nthe trouble of cutting! How different would have been the position\r\nof the lessors in this instance, I need not say, if, during the two\r\nlast cycles, when the oaks were becoming very thinly scattered, the\r\nunderwood had been cherished, as it most undoubtedly ought to have\r\nbeen. The neighbourhood was one where there was plenty of demand for\r\nthe produce of woods; the particular wood referred to, would have been,\r\non every account, as good a cover, and all parties would have been\r\nalike interested in the continuance of the lease.\r\n\r\nBut as I must now very shortly bring such of my “Remarks” as refer to\r\n“Ancient Woods,” to a close, it may be as well just to run over the\r\nwhole subject in a recapitulary form, so as to present it to the reader\r\nin a sort of bird’s-eye view.\r\n\r\nI have, then, endeavoured to show, that the present state of the\r\nAncient Woods of this kingdom is very far from what it ought to be,\r\nand fully proves that their owners have paid little attention to\r\nthem: that they are almost valueless to them, simply and only for\r\nwant of better management: that they are capable of such a degree of\r\nimprovement as would insure from them a fair, reasonable return: I have\r\nendeavoured to show this by contrasting the plans of woodmen, if they\r\ncan be said to have any, with those which, in my judgment, ought to be\r\npursued; and I am not aware that I have, upon any one point, exposed\r\nthe errors of their course, without suggesting that which I conceive\r\nwould be the right one. It is quite impossible, however, to lay down\r\nin a book like this, or in any other, specific rules or directions\r\nwhich shall constitute a sufficient guide for the manager of woods,\r\nout of the difficulties of a false position, or enable him to reform\r\nthe errors of a vicious practice: for, first, not one woodman in fifty\r\nwould be convinced, by any process of reasoning, that the present\r\nstate of woods is so bad as I have described it to be; and if they\r\nwould not admit the existence of the evil, they would not be likely to\r\nperceive the value of any remedial measures that might be recommended.\r\nNext: a difficulty would every where present itself, if woods were\r\nimproperly treated, from the woodman feeling that the introduction of\r\nany new plans would, necessarily, involve the condemnation of his own.\r\nBesides all this, as I have remarked before, so many things have to\r\nbe considered as to the state of a wood, before a safe opinion could\r\nbe given as to the best course to be taken with it, that nothing less\r\nthan a minute examination, affording the opportunity of duly weighing\r\nall the circumstances of each particular case, would justify any man in\r\nsuggesting a specific course.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this, I would offer the example of a wood which I will\r\nsuppose to be of forty years standing, and to have been started with\r\nas many oak plants as would suffice to insure a sufficient number of\r\ntimber trees, possessing ample length of bole, or stem. Upon the plan\r\nof management which I have suggested, there would be, at the second\r\ncutting of the under wood, a certain number of oaks to cut out also,\r\nand from the stools of these, there would start young shoots, which,\r\nif _properly dealt with_, would, with those which would spring from\r\nevery subsequent cutting, furnish a succession of timber trees; but if\r\nno care were taken in _nursing_ them, the probability is, that they\r\nwould be unfit for timber, and that it would therefore be necessary,\r\noccasionally, to introduce a small number of maiden plants, even as\r\nearly as the expiration of the second cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nPLANTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to afford some facility to the reader in perusing what I may\r\nwrite, I shall divide what I have to say into several distinct heads;\r\nand, first, as to the\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent Modes of Planting.\r\n\r\nMuch may, and probably ought, to be said, on the errors of bad\r\nplanters: it is indeed a prolific, as well as an important subject;\r\nand if there were any solid ground on which to rest a hope that an\r\nexposure of all the mistakes which are made in planting, would lead to\r\nthe abandonment of such plans and practices as would be shown to be\r\nwrong, it would be a duty worthy the exercise of talents of the highest\r\norder. It does not, however, absolutely _require_ the aid of brilliant\r\ntalent, or fervid eloquence, to place these matters in their proper\r\nlight before those who are most concerned; a plain reference to facts\r\nwill be quite sufficient for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe case of an Ancient Wood in an unthrifty and unprofitable condition,\r\ndoes not stand out so prominently—it is not so glaringly discreditable\r\nto its owner, as is a Plantation in the same state, which has been\r\nmade by himself; for as to the former, the fact that “_it always was\r\nso_,” is, to a certain extent, an excuse for bad management; and\r\nin truth, it will generally be found a very difficult affair, as I\r\nhave hinted before, to establish a _new system_ where the prejudice\r\nof ages, in favour of an _old one_, will meet the person who may\r\nattempt it, at every turn; but it is not so as to Plantations; when,\r\ntherefore, a gentleman decides to plant, and has himself to do with\r\nthe work _from the beginning_, both his interest, and his duty, point\r\nout the necessity of his seeing that it be _well done_; but the very\r\nreverse of this, is the _average_ of the general practice, as I shall\r\npresently show. It would be quite foreign to my purpose, to refer to\r\nthe minor shades of difference which exist in the practice of planters:\r\nsuch difference indeed may be met with, between plans which are each\r\nin themselves excellent; I shall content myself, therefore, with\r\nreferring, and that in general terms, to the most glaring mistakes\r\nwhich are committed, giving a few examples.\r\n\r\nTo an eye that can take in the whole, it is lamentable to see the\r\neffects of ignorance and neglect, in the original formation, as well as\r\nin the subsequent treatment, of Plantations! With many, it seems to be\r\nexpected that they will thrive and prosper, no matter how they may be\r\nput in, whereas the very contrary is the fact. With many planters there\r\nis a vague, indefinite notion—of course there is no _calculation_—that\r\nwhen once they are planted, trees will grow, not only without labour or\r\nculture, but under such adverse circumstances as at once convince the\r\nexperienced planter of the utter impossibility of their doing so. As I\r\nhave elsewhere said, a _young_ child, a _young_ animal, and a _young_\r\ntree, all require the greatest possible attention, and the tenderest\r\ntreatment; and the blighting effects which must result, and which do\r\nresult, from _the absence of early attention_, are to be seen quite as\r\nstrongly marked in the last, as in the other two.\r\n\r\nIn numerous instances—and this I shall call mistake the first—the trees\r\nare put in without any _previous preparation of the soil_. It is not\r\npossible, in the ordinary run of cases, to commit a greater error than\r\nthis. It is, emphatically, to build upon a bad foundation, and it is\r\nvery rarely indeed that Plantations, so commenced, ever make any thing\r\nout. When I say this, I do not mean to assert that they never become\r\ntrees of any size: _unfortunately they do_, in some situations, and men\r\nare so ignorant—there is so little real scientific knowledge of the\r\nsubject to be met with anywhere—that the most erroneous conclusions are\r\ndrawn from this fact. The question as to what a Plantation might have\r\ndone, or what it _would_ have done, if it had been properly treated,\r\nis never thought of! No one ever dreams of instituting a comparison\r\nbetween such a Plantation as _it is_, and _as it ought to have been_.\r\nAnd yet this is the very first question which should be asked, or\r\nrather which should be _anticipated_.\r\n\r\nBut the majority of Plantations, which are commenced without any\r\npreparation of the soil, are complete failures, as may be seen by any\r\none who chooses to take the trouble to examine for himself.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by a most mistaken notion of economy, many persons plant\r\ntheir trees on land which is already fully occupied—it may be, by\r\nling, by bracken, or by long grass, or twitch—and in most cases of\r\nthis sort, the greater number die; but there may probably remain a\r\nfew which sustain a feeble existence, so as just to make _a show of\r\na Plantation_, and the owner seldom gives himself the trouble to\r\nattempt to ascertain why it is no better. The method usually adopted,\r\nwhen planting is done in this way, is, to dig small holes at fixed\r\ndistances, into which the plants are put by the workman in the best\r\nmanner that he can, and they are left to fight their way as best they\r\nmay.\r\n\r\nMr. Withers, of Holt, in Norfolk, has ably, and indignantly, denounced\r\nthe hole-digging system, and has shown, most clearly, the advantage\r\nof “_the highest degree of culture_,” for raising timber, whether as\r\na pecuniary question, or where it is wanted for merely ornamental\r\npurposes. It is true that an opinion at variance with his, has been\r\ngiven by some, but every practical man will, at once, perceive where\r\nthe truth lies; nor will he be at any loss, whether, in the preparation\r\nof a field for planting, to follow the directions of Sir Henry Steuart,\r\nor those of Mr. Withers.\r\n\r\nIt was the practice of the latter gentleman, to trench his ground\r\nfrom “fourteen to eighteen inches deep,” and on poor land, to “put\r\non as much manure as if turnips were intended to be sown,” and to\r\nhoe and keep clean the land, _for seven years after planting_. The\r\nresults were, extraordinary rapidity of growth, and a consequent early\r\nand ample return upon the capital invested, in addition to the full\r\naccomplishment of an object, which is, of course, ardently desired by\r\nevery planter: viz.: the pleasure of seeing rapidly rise up before him,\r\na healthy and most promising race of trees.\r\n\r\nThe second mistake which I shall notice is a very common one; and is\r\ncommitted by those who _prepare the land well, but, by a bad selection\r\nof plants_, either as to age, or kind, or both, render success\r\nimpossible. The error as to _age_ consists, most frequently, in their\r\nbeing _too old_: that as to the _kind_, in not choosing such as _are\r\nadapted_ to the nature of the soil.\r\n\r\nA third class of planters may be met with, who, to a certain extent,\r\navoid all the mistakes previously referred to, but who commit the\r\nunaccountable blunder of throwing the various kinds promiscuously\r\ntogether, without any _regard to congeniality as to the plants_; and\r\nin this case, the trees that are really valuable are overtopped, and\r\nmastered by a set of _worthless trash_, which, when full grown, are\r\nhardly worth the trouble of cutting down. _When a Plantation is made\r\nin this barbarous manner, and left in this state for twenty years, or\r\neven less_, no subsequent efforts, however sound the judgment which is\r\nexercised may be, can _wholly_ repair the mischief which is done. By\r\nthis mistake, an immense loss of property accrues to the proprietor,\r\nand the worst of all is, that the trite consolation is not left\r\nhim, that what is “his loss, is another’s gain,” for here nobody is\r\nbenefitted; while to himself there is superadded the mortification of a\r\n_loss of time_, “which no man can restore.”\r\n\r\nThat the strong language which I have here employed is fully justified,\r\nwill at once be admitted by every reflecting person, who has any\r\nacquaintance with these matters; for it will appear at the outset, that\r\nif a slow-growing tree is planted close to one which will grow half as\r\nfast again, and if the slow grower is the tree _intended for timber_,\r\nthe latter must inevitably be so much damaged as to affect its health\r\nfor ever, if something be not done to relieve it.\r\n\r\nI shall not, in this place, “remark” more particularly on this point,\r\nthan to say, that I have often seen the oak in this relative position,\r\nwith the alder, the birch, the poplar, the larch, and other trees.\r\n\r\nTo imagine that a comparatively slow-growing tree can be placed in\r\nnear contiguity with another whose rate of progress is much quicker,\r\n_without_ receiving injury, is to manifest a want of knowledge of the\r\nhabits of trees, which may be excused in an amateur planter, but which\r\ncannot be overlooked in a practical man, who is well paid for his\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nA fourth error which is committed, is one upon which I have slightly\r\ntouched already, and refers to the question of _adaptation of the kind\r\nof tree planted_, first, to _the nature of the soil planted upon_, and\r\nnext, _if the object of the planter be profit, to the local demand_.\r\n\r\nMost serious mistakes have been committed upon both these points, even\r\nby men whose writings have procured them a niche in the Temple of Fame.\r\nUnder this head a few cases will now be referred to.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, at this distance of time, to fix the exact amount\r\nof blame, or responsibility, which of right attaches itself to the\r\nname of _Pontey_, for instance, who planted an immense tract of land\r\nnear Lincoln, belonging to that splendid charity, Christ’s Hospital:\r\ntradition, which, however, may do him injustice, accuses him of having\r\ncontracted to plant with Larch and Oak, and having, on some pretence or\r\nother, substituted Scotch Fir.\r\n\r\nWhatever was the precise amount of _responsibility_ attaching to him,\r\nI know not; he might be following out the letter of his instructions,\r\nfor ought that I can tell, but it is quite certain that, even with the\r\nthen imperfect knowledge which was possessed of the value of larch,\r\n_a very great mistake_ was committed, in planting nearly a thousand\r\nacres of land, which was well adapted both for oak and larch, with\r\nprofitless rubbish like that which is now seen upon it. A work of that\r\nmagnitude ought not to have been intrusted to any one who, either\r\nfrom mercenary motives, or from limited views, was capable of falling\r\ninto such a gross error, as to the interests of his employers. It is\r\nno exaggeration to say, that if the Skellingthorpe Plantation had\r\nbeen planted, as it ought to have been, with oak and larch, together\r\nwith a few spruce firs, and if Pontey had left _suitable instructions\r\nwith those who had to take care of it, after his superintendence had\r\nceased_, it would now have been, at the most moderate computation,\r\n_fifteen hundred per cent. more valuable than it is_!\r\n\r\nIf it were _private property_, I should not presume to add what I now\r\nfeel myself at perfect liberty to do, with reference to its present\r\ncondition, and the future prospect respecting it.\r\n\r\nIt is at present, almost universally, a _Scotch Fir Plantation_: these\r\nare of a most miserable size, compared with what they might have been,\r\nunder good management, and they are withal very coarse. There may be\r\nseen amongst them, just Larches enough to perpetuate the folly of the\r\noriginal planter; and to excite, at his periodical sales, the keen\r\nregret of the present Steward, that he has not more of them to sell.\r\nThere are also a few oaks, of such quality as fully to prove that they\r\nwould have thriven well—had they been planted. Further: the Scotch\r\nfirs are so thick, and they are _feathered down so low_, that the\r\nPlantation is not _healthy_. It is true that, under the present _much\r\nimproved_ management, an attempt is being made to remedy this evil,\r\nand it is quite clear, that the condition of the trees will gradually\r\nbe bettered, but the misfortune is—and here I come to speak of the\r\n_prospects_ of the Plantation—that _they are not worth culture_. I have\r\nno hesitation in stating this to be my deliberate opinion. The timber,\r\nif timber it can be called, is worth almost _nothing now_, and, in such\r\na locality, I can see no probability of its ever realizing, so as to\r\njustify those in whose care it is placed, in continuing it as it is.\r\nThe plain and obvious course of the managers of this fine estate, then,\r\nis _to stub up the Scotch fir, and replant the land with oak and larch_.\r\n\r\nIn further proof of the propriety of this opinion, I would remark that,\r\nin this locality, both oak and larch fetch _very high prices_, and\r\nthere are probable grounds for expecting that they always will do so;\r\nwhile, if the present race of Scotch firs should stand as long again as\r\nthey have already stood, they will make comparatively little.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say, that if this Plantation were the property of\r\na private gentleman, the Scotch firs would be extirpated as speedily\r\nas possible, and a systematic plan, providing that a certain number\r\nof acres should be stubbed and re-planted every year, would at once\r\nbe laid down; but public bodies are not so easily moved, and it is\r\ntherefore to be feared, that, in this case, the _public_ will not, for\r\nsome time to come, derive that benefit from the property, which would\r\ncertainly be the result of proper management.\r\n\r\nThe whole might be re-stocked with suitable kinds of trees, without\r\nany considerable outlay to the hospital, if arrangements were made\r\nwith a party capable of carrying out some such comprehensive plan as\r\nthe following; viz.: An agreement with a responsible person, carefully\r\nworded, providing that he should stub, or grub up, a stipulated number\r\nof acres at the commencement of a sort of lease, _taking the stuff_,\r\neither in part payment, or wholly, if it were _sufficient_: and that\r\nhe should, on such terms as could be agreed upon, continue to grub up,\r\n_and plant_, a specified number of acres every succeeding year.\r\n\r\nIn twelve years, _if the work were well done_, there would be some\r\nreturn from the _thinnings of the piece first planted_; and the _rate\r\nof return_ and profit, would, from that time, _continue to increase_\r\nevery year, until an amount would be realized which would much more\r\nthan equal the largest expectations of the Governors.\r\n\r\nI shall only mention one case more, as to the want of adaptation of\r\nthe kind of tree _to the soil_, and to the local demand, and that is a\r\nwood belonging to the Right Honourable Lord Middleton, at Stapleford,\r\nnear Newark, and which, some years ago, consisted almost entirely of\r\nScotch fir. It is now of an age and size that enables me to cite it in\r\nproof of the opinion which I have given, relative to the _prospect_\r\nfor the Skellingthorpe Plantation. The timber has arrived at a good\r\nmarketable size, and is sold at as high a rate as there is any reason\r\nto suppose would be made of the Skellingthorpe Scotch, when it shall\r\nhave reached to the same size. That price is _apparently_ moderate,\r\nbut it is so inferior in quality, or, perhaps, it is more correct to\r\nsay, such a bad opinion is formed of it, by most people, that when it\r\nis converted into boards or scantling, the price it fetches is so low\r\nas to hold out little inducement to Timber merchants to purchase it.\r\nAnd as to the grower, I am persuaded that, if simple interest upon the\r\noriginal investment were to be calculated, up to the time when the wood\r\nfirst began to clear its own expences, and added to the first cost,\r\nit would not be found that there is much surplus over the necessary\r\nexpences of management. At all events it would be seen there, as well\r\nas at Skellingthorpe, from the little Larch and Oak which they have\r\nhad to sell, that the returns are comparatively small to what they\r\nwould have been, if Larch had first been planted along with Oak. This\r\nlarge Plantation will, in the course of a few years, under the present\r\nenlightened and skilful management, to a great extent, be cleared of\r\nthe Scotch firs; in place of which, the noble proprietor will have _a\r\nrace of fine oaks_, thus proving, to actual demonstration, the great\r\nmistake which was originally committed, in occupying the land with a\r\nclass of trees which, when they have arrived at _maturity_, are of\r\ncomparatively little value.\r\n\r\nI pass on to remark upon a fifth error. One gentleman will, from\r\nmotives of economy, _stick in the plants with as little labour as\r\npossible_: another will aim at the same result, by putting in fewer,\r\nor smaller plants than he ought to do. Both these, and indeed all the\r\nparties, who are influenced by the same narrow and shortsighted views,\r\ngreatly err: these are not the _cheapest_, but the _most expensive_,\r\nas well as the worst adapted, modes of planting. To insure a healthy\r\nand vigorous _commencement_ to a Plantation, if that is followed up\r\nby suitable treatment afterwards, is to secure both rapid progress,\r\nand early maturity, and by necessary consequence, the largest possible\r\namount of pecuniary return.\r\n\r\nLastly, as to modes of planting, and without ranging either party among\r\nthose who are clearly and decidedly _mistaken_ in their views, one\r\nclass of persons will plant _thickly_, and another class will plant\r\n_thinly_, from various motives, but both without paying due regard to\r\nthe capabilities, and adaptation of the soil, and, as is very natural,\r\nin the absence of all calculation, both are frequently subjected to the\r\nsame result,—either a partial or complete failure of their expectations.\r\n\r\nIt is neither my purpose, nor is it in my power, to decide, upon\r\npaper, what is the best average distance at which the trees of a young\r\nPlantation should be placed from each other. Many questions ought to be\r\npreviously asked, as many very important considerations will present\r\nthemselves to the mind of a practical man, before he will decide.\r\n\r\nIn the average of cases, where _planting for profit_ is the object, the\r\nquestion is not one of much practical difficulty; but in many others,\r\nthe primary purpose, or the ultimate aim, of the planter—the local\r\nmarket—the cost of plants, &c. will claim very special attention.\r\n\r\nWhen the object is to beautify the Landscape, or to produce effect in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of a Mansion, it will be necessary to set aside\r\nordinary rules, and to depart from _some_ of the recognized principles\r\nwhich ought always to govern, in planting for profit. But even here,\r\nnothing should be done, nothing should be attempted, which is not\r\nin strict consistence with those general laws which the principles\r\nof vegetable physiology impose, alike on a Gentleman who removes a\r\nlarge tree upon the plan recommended by Sir Henry Steuart, and on the\r\npractical Planter, who is professionally employed to plant a large\r\ntract of country.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my business to remark upon the merits of the\r\nrespective plans which have been tried by different persons, for\r\nenriching the scenery of a Park; but I have no difficulty in saying\r\nthat, where it is well understood and properly carried out, the\r\ncombination of Sir Henry’s plan, with the judicious arrangement of\r\nsmall Plantations; putting into a well prepared soil, good, stout,\r\nwell-rooted, and vigorous plants, at a considerable distance, will\r\nbest effect that object. And as I have referred to Sir Henry Steuart’s\r\nmethod of removing large trees, it will not be out of place here to\r\nobserve, that the _abuse_ of that plan has very frequently brought\r\nit into disrepute, and given birth to the conclusion, that it was\r\nnot adapted to the end proposed: and thus blame has fallen on the\r\ningenious, skilful, and scientific Baronet, instead of its resting\r\non the heads of those whose “mismanagement” had actually invited the\r\nfailures which they were doomed to suffer.\r\n\r\nThose who have most carefully attended to Sir Henry’s instructions in\r\nremoving large subjects, will have been most successful; and while they\r\nwill be the first to admit that the plan is one of very considerable\r\ndifficulty, and requiring the greatest possible amount of attention;\r\nthey will be the most powerful and decided witnesses in its favour, for\r\nthe purposes for which it is here recommended.\r\n\r\nBut when Plantations on a large scale are desired, and when the planter\r\nconsiders his _posterity_ more than himself, there can be no doubt at\r\nall, that, on certain qualities of soil, _tolerably thick_ planting\r\nis best. And if it be desired to have a race of fine noble Oaks, they\r\nmust be put in _very thick_, and the planter must not expect, during a\r\nlife of average duration, _any profit at all_; for, in order to secure\r\nhis object, he must, first, _prepare the ground well_: and next, he\r\nmust either _sow acorns_, or he must put in _an immense number of\r\nplants_—and, in either case, he will incur a heavy outlay. He must, for\r\nthe first seven years, _keep the ground clean_, and he must plant along\r\nwith the Oak, a selection of those kinds of trees, _as nurses_, which\r\nare best adapted to the purpose, and not those which might probably, at\r\nthe earliest period, find their way into the _local_ market, and make\r\nthe best price when there; although these points should not be left out\r\nof consideration.\r\n\r\nBut now, the question as to planting, or sowing, or, if the former be\r\npreferred, that of the distance of the plants, being settled, the next\r\nwhich presents itself is this: what kinds shall be planted as the\r\n\r\n\r\nNurses for the Oak.\r\n\r\nHere again, a good deal will depend upon the object of the planter, the\r\nnature of the soil, and the exact arrangements which are made at the\r\ntime of planting; for it might be quite proper to plant a species of\r\nTree in one place, while, owing to a difference in the staple or the\r\ncondition of the soil, it would be just the reverse in another.\r\n\r\nThe remarks which I shall have to make on this subject have, in some\r\ndegree, been anticipated by the observations which I have already\r\nmade, respecting the Skellingthorpe Plantation, but a more particular\r\nreference to a few well-known kinds, may not be amiss.\r\n\r\nI begin with the _Larch_, which, from its great value to Farmers and\r\nothers, is fairly entitled to precedence.\r\n\r\nThe Larch is found, in greater or smaller proportions, in most places\r\nwhere Plantations are made; and it is entirely the planter’s fault, if\r\nhe be not well acquainted with its character, as a nurse for Oak. I say\r\nthis, because it has been so extensively tested, and its habits are so\r\nwell known, that no one, having the slightest wish to become acquainted\r\nwith it, can have failed for want of opportunity.\r\n\r\nI have very often seen the Larch where it has proved an exceedingly bad\r\nnurse; where, in fact, instead of nursing the Oaks, it has destroyed\r\nthem: but this has, of course, arisen from “mismanagement,” and might\r\nhave been avoided. When good, stiff, healthy Oak Plants are put in\r\nwith Larch only, or but with very few of any other sort, the Larch\r\nought not, in the first place, to be put _too near_—the exact distance\r\ncan only be determined relatively to that of the Oaks—secondly: an\r\nadvantage should be given to the Oaks, if possible, _at the start_;\r\neither by assigning them a portion of the soil from the land intended\r\nfor the Larch, or in some other way; after which, if the latter are\r\nconstantly watched, they will approve themselves very suitable and\r\nvaluable nurses; but if they are allowed, as they too generally are,\r\nto take the lead of the Oak, they will plentifully avail themselves of\r\nthe licence, to the serious and, perhaps, irreparable injury of that\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nFor large Plantations, intended for profit, it may be questioned\r\nwhether, in the first instance, any thing else than Oak and Larch\r\nshould be planted, and the distance must be decided after due\r\nconsideration is given to the quality and condition of the land.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a disposition is felt to plant other kinds, as nurses,\r\nthere can be no objection, provided that their companionship is made\r\nfully to square with the well-being of the trees intended for timber.\r\n\r\nBut where it is intended to introduce nothing that shall not act as a\r\ngood nurse for the Oak, exception must certainly be taken to the Alder,\r\nthe Poplars, the Sycamore, the Horse Chesnut, the Birch, and the Scotch\r\nFir, &c. Not one of these discovers any congeniality for the Oak, nor\r\nany fitness for the office of nursing it; and it does really appear to\r\nmy mind, as most unaccountably strange, that trees of all sorts should,\r\nwithout forethought, or calculation—and most particularly, that no\r\nreference should be made to their suitability or adaptation for the\r\ncircumstances in which they are to be placed—be planted at a greater\r\ncost than would have sufficed to procure an ample number of the right\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nUpon a suitable soil, the Spruce Fir has always appeared to me, to\r\nbe decidedly and incomparably the best nurse of the Oak. I have, for\r\ninstance, often seen, on a clay soil, a Spruce Fir, and an Oak of\r\ntwenty-five years growth, flourishing admirably, in close proximity\r\nwith each other—even within a foot and a half. I do not think that this\r\ncould be said of any other tree than the Spruce Fir; but besides this,\r\nthere is almost always a very peculiar healthiness about the Oaks,\r\nwhere the Spruce has been planted and cherished as the principal nurse.\r\nThere seems to be the best possible understanding between them—no\r\nstruggling for pre-eminence—no blighting influence exercised by the one\r\nover the other. But the Spruce Fir is not found to flourish so well on\r\nsome soils as on others: it will therefore, mostly, be advisable to\r\nunite with it, for a number of years, the _Larch_, which may be so\r\nplaced as to be all weeded out during the course of thinning, which\r\nought to commence in a few years after planting, and go on until there\r\nremains nothing but Oak in possession of the ground.\r\n\r\nIn concluding my remarks on Planting, I cannot help referring to the\r\nspecimens of sowing and thick planting, which may be seen on the\r\nextensive estate of the Duke of Portland, at Welbeck, and in that\r\nneighbourhood. It has always been His Grace’s practice, either to sow\r\nAcorns, or to plant Oaks, in alternate beds, having Larch between. If\r\nthe Oaks were planted, they were put in _very thickly_; and although\r\ntheir progress was necessarily slower than it would have been, if they\r\nhad been allowed more room, it cannot be doubted that His Grace had a\r\ngreat advantage in the almost unlimited choice which it gave him, of\r\ntrees _of perfect form_, for the ultimate crop of timber.\r\n\r\nThe system of _thick planting_ has been fully carried out: having\r\nprepared the ground well, His Grace appears to have never lost sight,\r\nfor an instant, of the young trees that he had undertaken to rear:\r\nthere has been no mistaken practice—no niggardly economy—no ruinous\r\nneglect, rendering all his previous care abortive, and sacrificing his\r\nlarge outlay at the commencement. When the Plantations have required\r\nattention, they have evidently had it.\r\n\r\nThe admirer of fine timber will see, in the Duke’s Plantations and\r\ngrounds, some of the most perfectly formed trees that can be conceived\r\nof, and that not on a small scale, but to an extent as comprehensive as\r\nthat truly noble Duke’s genius, of whom it may probably be said that\r\nhe unites, in his mind and person, as many of those qualities which\r\nconstitute true Nobility, as any Gentleman of his day.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the power of my feeble pen to show the immense amount\r\nof good which has accrued to the immediate neighbourhood, from the\r\nemployment of the poor in the locality, in carrying on, and in\r\ncompleting, those splendid improvements which His Grace has originated,\r\nand which have caused the literal desert to “blossom as the rose”: much\r\nless can I describe the area of the vast circle, within which the most\r\nbeneficial effects have been felt, from the influence of the noble\r\nDuke’s example, while perfecting, as he has done, his various plans for\r\nthe improvement of his fine estate.\r\n\r\nIn the Welbeck Plantations will be found, as I have said, a class\r\nof trees, most perfectly suited to the situations where they stand,\r\nand giving the surest promise of future superiority: but what, let\r\nme ask, would have been the quality of the Oaks, if the noble Duke\r\nhad jumbled together an incongruous admixture of _various sorts_, as\r\nhas been recommended by various writers of eminence, even in our own\r\nday? I am not disposed to enter into a controversy with any of those\r\nwho have recorded their opinions in their writings, otherwise I might\r\nhave plenty of work on my hands: it will be quite as much as ought\r\nto be expected from me, if I defend my own: but I would just quote a\r\nsingle paragraph from an interesting and useful, but, on some points,\r\nincorrect volume, published by “The Society for the diffusion of\r\nUseful Knowledge.” It is entitled “Useful and Ornamental Planting.”\r\nThe passage to which I refer, will be found in the 43rd page, and runs\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n“_Simple Plantations_ consist of one or two species of trees only;\r\n_mixed Plantations_ of many different species. The latter, on suitable\r\nsoils, are the most profitable: they afford an earlier, more permanent,\r\nand a larger return for Capital than simple Plantations.”\r\n\r\nIn a book where there is so much to commend, where so many valuable\r\npractical directions are given, it cannot but excite regret, to meet\r\nwith a paragraph so vague and unsatisfactory as the above; for I cannot\r\nbut remark, that if any planter should adopt the suggestion which is\r\nthrown out, it will end in disappointment and loss. It will, in my\r\njudgment, generally be best for the planter to select such trees for\r\nnurses as are most congenial, and best adapted to the local market; and\r\nsurely these will not be the Birch, the Beech, the Alder, or the Scotch\r\nFir; none of which are ever found to answer the purpose of nursing\r\nthe more valuable timber trees, or of securing a fair return for the\r\ninvestment of capital.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the opinion which I have quoted, is afterwards\r\nqualified by the remark, that certain “circumstances connected with the\r\ngrowth of the various species of forest trees, effectually control\r\nthe planter in his modes of arrangement, &c.” but even with this\r\nlimitation, the planter is liable to be misled, for he is not taught to\r\nset a higher value upon the Larch, which may in almost every locality\r\nbe planted with a much better chance of profit, than the other kinds\r\nwith which it is ranked, and which ought therefore, if profit be the\r\nobject, for that reason alone, to be preferred.\r\n\r\nIn any thing else but planting, the mischief of such a mistake,\r\nas producing that which was worthless when produced, would, in a\r\nshort time, have cured itself; but so little of science, or even of\r\ncommon calculation, have been brought to bear upon the practice of\r\nArboriculture, that, notwithstanding the evidence which is every where\r\nto be met with, of serious “loss and disappointment,” for want of\r\ncalculation, these matters go on very much as they “always have done.”\r\n\r\nFinally, as to planting, it must, in every case, be perfectly clear\r\nto one who is competent to judge, that, whether the object be profit\r\nmerely, or the embellishment of the landscape, the land ought to be as\r\nwell prepared as circumstances will permit, and that _such species of\r\ntrees should be preferred, as are best adapted to the specific object\r\nof the planter_.\r\n\r\nThe distance at which the plants shall be put in, is more a matter of\r\nopinion than some planters would be inclined to admit. For myself, I am\r\ndisposed to think, that some advantages are lost to a Plantation, under\r\ncertain combinations of soil and circumstances, when it is planted\r\n_thickly_, but I would not either rate the loss too highly, or express\r\nmy opinion, with unseemly positiveness: my notion is, that the supposed\r\nadvantages of planting thickly may generally be supplied by _early,\r\njudicious pruning_, and that the progress of the Plantation would be\r\nfacilitated thereby: that, in fact, a Plantation of trees at a distance\r\nof three feet, being properly assorted, having had a good start,\r\nand suitable treatment in all respects afterwards, would reach any\r\ngiven point as to size, and quality, in less time than would another\r\nPlantation, upon the same soil, if the method of either sowing acorns,\r\n&c., or planting very thickly, were adopted. In saying this, I by no\r\nmeans wish to condemn the practice of thick planting; to do this, in\r\nthe face of proofs of success, such as I have described as existing\r\nin this country, would be an absurdity of which I would not willingly\r\nbe guilty; but at the same time, I would not hesitate to range myself\r\namong those who _prefer_, under ordinary circumstances, to plant at\r\na moderate distance, and rely upon _early pruning_, for securing the\r\nobject which the close planter has in view, viz., length of bole, or\r\nstem, and clearness of grain.\r\n\r\nI come now to remark upon the\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent mode of managing Plantations after they are made.\r\n\r\nAbiding still, most strictly, by the rule laid down for myself, to\r\ndeal with every part of my subject practically, I proceed to observe,\r\nthat the instances where Plantations are treated with due regard to\r\nthe principles of Arboricultural science, are not the rule, but the\r\nexceptions to the rule, as every scientific planter, who has looked\r\nround him, must know.\r\n\r\nInstead of the trees intended for timber being nursed with the\r\ntenderest care from their infancy—instead of their being treated\r\naccording to the known and fixed laws which regulate, and effectually\r\ncontrol, the economy of vegetable life, whether men attend to them\r\nor not—they too frequently meet with treatment which is in direct\r\nopposition to those laws. I shall show this as clearly, and as plainly,\r\nas I can.\r\n\r\nWhen a gentleman has decided to plant, when he has fixed upon the right\r\nmode of doing it, and has finished it in a proper manner; so far he\r\nhas done all that could be expected from him; but if, after this, he\r\nleaves his Plantation to itself for five, ten, or fifteen years, he\r\ntransgresses the laws to which I have referred; and his error is one of\r\n_omission_.\r\n\r\nAgain: were the same gentleman, after the lapse of ten years, or even\r\nless, to enter his Plantation, and cut and thin _very freely_, he would\r\nviolate those laws by an error of _commission_, and in this case, as\r\nwell as the other, the Plantation would very materially suffer.\r\n\r\nA Plantation which should be subjected, at so early a stage of its\r\nexistence as ten or fifteen years, to the ordeal of both these classes\r\nof errors, could have but little chance of succeeding: it could not be\r\nexpected to make any more than very slow progress after such treatment\r\nas this: and yet this is exactly the way in which many Plantations are\r\nmanaged, at _all_ stages of their growth. I have recently met with\r\na splendid Larch Plantation, which has never been thinned, from the\r\nfirst, except by “fits and starts”; of which injudicious treatment, I\r\ncould see very serious “outward and visible signs.” Although it is upon\r\nexceedingly weak and poor land, it would have produced, _if it had been\r\nproperly managed_, a fine class of Larches, which would have yielded\r\nto the proprietor an abundant return upon his outlay. If any one doubt\r\nthis, let him look around and see if he cannot find a Plantation of\r\nforty or fifty years growth, which is crowded with trees—say of Larch\r\nonly—and he will, upon examination, perceive that there are two or\r\nthree distinct classes of trees still standing, all of which ought,\r\nlong before, to have been taken out; and that there is _but one class\r\nof Larches_, probably, which should be standing. The other two classes\r\nwhich I have just mentioned, would be found, if the fact could be\r\nclearly come at, very nearly of the same size as they had been many\r\nyears before; inasmuch as they could not possibly make any wood, being\r\nthemselves overtopped by their more thriving and vigorous neighbours.\r\nIt is perfectly obvious too, that the injury arising to the Plantation\r\nwould not stop here. So long as under-strappers were allowed to remain,\r\nthey would, to a certain extent, have the effect of preventing the\r\nadmission of light and air into the Plantation, which would materially\r\naffect the health and the progress of the standard trees.\r\n\r\nThe errors of _omission_ are both serious and numerous: those of\r\n_commission_, great though they be, are not equally so. The former\r\nare generally first in the order of time, for where one Plantation is\r\ninjured from _too early thinning_, there are ten that suffer for the\r\nwant of it; and this early neglect affects the vitality and prosperity\r\nof a Plantation much more than might be supposed. Omitting to do what\r\nought to be done will, however, be very prejudicial to the health of\r\nPlantations at any stage of their existence, and it is quite well known\r\nto the experienced Forester, that they ought ever to be watched with\r\nmost tender care, until the planter is fully satisfied that he has\r\ncompleted the nursing and training of a sufficient number of standard\r\ntrees, to furnish the ultimate crop.\r\n\r\nBut errors of omission sometimes admit of remedy; whereas, if injury is\r\ncommitted by excessive thinning, or by cutting down trees which ought\r\nto have remained, it is often difficult, and sometimes impossible,\r\nto repair the mischief that is done. Both the errors to which I have\r\nalluded, must be avoided by the planter who would desire to have a\r\nhealthy and _continuously thriving_ Plantation.\r\n\r\nHaving considered well the following points, viz., the preparation of\r\nhis land—the selection of the species of trees that he will plant—their\r\nsize and quality—and the distance at which they shall stand from each\r\nother, he must remember that, from the very first, they will not only\r\nrequire, but they will well pay for, his closest attention. During\r\nthe first seven years, he may, probably, have little else to do at\r\nthem than to _keep the land clean_; but this will, in some degree,\r\ndepend upon the distance which he has chosen for them; and on the kind\r\nwhich he intends for the final crop of timber. But whatever _they_ may\r\nbe—whether the Oak alone, or along with some other species, the trees\r\nintended for timber will demand the peculiar, the unremitted, attention\r\nof the planter: his object must ever be to deal with all the rest, with\r\ndistinct, direct, and positive reference to _the careful nursing of\r\nthose_: and it must always be borne in mind, that whatever be the fate\r\nof the _nurses_, those which I will again distinguish from the rest,\r\nby calling them the _standard trees_, must, if possible, be kept in\r\nvigorous health. This can only be done, concurrently with the ultimate\r\nobject of securing great length of bole, by _pruning_ of some sort or\r\nother. If the trees are so planted as to insure _natural_ pruning,\r\nno other, _except of the nurses_, will be required, but the first\r\noperation will be _thinning_; which should be done with great care and\r\njudgment. Where it is not so done, it is more than probable that trees\r\nwill be taken which should have been left, and the contrary. As it\r\nrespects the Oak, the principal point to be aimed at is, to spare all\r\nthose, as the thinning goes on, that have the best defined heads. This\r\nwill be an easy matter with an experienced and well-taught planter,\r\nor woodman, and the difficulty, if any there be, will be less at each\r\nsucceeding thinning, as the heads of the trees develope themselves.\r\n\r\nBut when trees are not planted so thickly as to insure length of\r\nbole by natural pruning, they must be pruned with the knife and the\r\nbill-hook, and the earlier the operation is begun, the better.\r\n\r\nI doubt not but some of my readers will stamp this advice with\r\ntheir unqualified disapprobation. It may be very good and correct\r\nnotwithstanding. My own experience, as well as that of many others whom\r\nI have consulted, convinces me that the notion, which so extensively\r\nprevails, as to the injurious effects of pruning, is _decidedly\r\nincorrect_. It may have had its origin in the evidence of injury to\r\ntimber, which has been furnished by _injudicious pruning_; and thus\r\nwhat would have else been universally seen to be necessary, has come\r\nto be almost universally condemned: but this is a common error, and has\r\nbeen too often shown, to render it necessary for me to expose it here.\r\nSome very valuable observations on pruning have been published by Mr.\r\nMain, in his excellent little work, entitled “The Forest Planter and\r\nPruner’s Assistant.” At page 53, the following paragraph occurs: “But\r\nthe only part of a woodman’s duty which does not appear to be well\r\ndefined, or at least not generally agreed upon by practical men, is\r\nrelative to the necessity of carefully pruning and managing the trees\r\nduring the first fifteen or twenty years of their growth.”\r\n\r\nI quote the last member of the above with entire approbation: that is,\r\nso far as the necessity for pruning is recognized in it: and I further\r\nthink, that the reasons which are given by Mr. Main for pruning, and\r\nthe manner in which he has illustrated his principle—the clear and\r\nsatisfactory way in which he has treated the whole subject—entitle him\r\nto the confidence, and to the thanks, of all who are interested in the\r\ngrowth of trees. But I am very far indeed from agreeing with him in the\r\nopinion so adventurously given, that “the best methods of preparing\r\nthe ground for the reception of the plants—manner of transplanting—the\r\nsoils most suitable for each species—are all _thoroughly_ and\r\n_universally_ understood.” My belief is, on the contrary, that\r\ncomparatively few planters, or woodmen, _do_ “_thoroughly_” understand\r\nthese matters. If they did, their practice would not be so extensively\r\nwrong as it is. If it were so, why have planters so widely differed?\r\nWhy is there seen such discrepancy in their modes of management?\r\nBut what does Mr. Main wish his readers to understand by the term\r\n“_practical men_”? If he refer to those who have the oversight and the\r\ndirection of the practical operations included in the “preparation of\r\nthe soil for the reception of the plants—manner of transplanting—the\r\nsoils most suitable for each species, &c.”; and if he wish to convey\r\nthe idea that, by this class of persons, these points are “_thoroughly\r\nand universally understood_,” I hold him to be wholly and widely wrong:\r\nbut if he only mean that _scientific men_, who have well studied\r\nthe subject, and who have written upon it, and _really intelligent\r\nwoodmen_, are agreed as to the best practice, I do not greatly differ\r\nfrom him; nor do I conceive that the main point, at which I have aimed\r\nin this publication, will be at all affected by any concession which\r\nI make to this effect: my principal object has been, and will be, to\r\nshow that, however clearly and strongly may have been shown, _the\r\npropriety of acting in conformity with the principles of science_,\r\nin the original formation of Woods and Plantations, in the planting\r\nof Hedge-row Timber, and in the general management of them all, the\r\n_practice_ of “_practical men_,” has been, “except as before excepted,”\r\nso bad, that the most charitable conclusion which can be drawn is, that\r\nthey “_thoroughly_” _misunderstand_ almost every part of the subject!\r\nIt seems rather to me, that instead of there being only one point in\r\ntheir practice on which they need enlightenment, that there is but\r\none on which they may be said to agree, and that is in a _thorough_\r\ncontempt for all rules, all principles, all science! in other words,\r\nthat this class of persons has displayed an amount of ignorance,\r\n(which, however, has been more their _misfortune_ than their _fault_,)\r\nand the want of a proper apprehension of the nature and extent of their\r\nobligations, and duties, which has no parallel in the management of\r\nany other description of property.\r\n\r\nBut this is a digression: I pass on, therefore, to the question of\r\n_pruning_, on which I would again commend to the notice of my readers,\r\nthe valuable remarks of Mr. Main, as well as some excellent practical\r\nobservations from the pen of that veteran in the service, Francis\r\nBlakie, Esq., late Steward to the Earl of Leicester, from whose\r\nsmall pamphlet, entitled “A Treatise on the Management of Hedges and\r\nHedge-row Timber,” the most useful information may be gathered.\r\n\r\nMr. Main’s is an able and lucid examination of the question of pruning,\r\nand, to my thinking, most fully and satisfactorily settles it. He shows\r\nthat when pruning is properly done, and when it is commenced _early_\r\nenough, and so managed as to secure the desired result in fifteen or\r\ntwenty years, it may not only be done with safety, and without material\r\ninjury to the timber, but that no other plan or practice will answer\r\nso well. This he clearly proves upon scientific data, familiarly\r\nillustrated by numerous plates, and confirmed by practical statements.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it were only from _neglecting to prune_ that the\r\nPlantations of this kingdom had gone wrong, the “mismanagement” would\r\nnot have furnished a subject for remarks so strong as it now does; but,\r\nas I have stated over and over again, the practice is, in most cases\r\nand on many accounts, at every stage of their progress, almost as bad\r\nas it can be.\r\n\r\nThe treatment which a Plantation ought to receive, may be comprised in\r\na very few words. The principals will require pruning from an early\r\nperiod after being planted, and the pruning must be continued, more or\r\nless, according to circumstances, either every year or every alternate\r\nyear, until it is from fifteen to twenty years old; and, during the\r\nsame period, a small portion of _thinning_ will probably be required.\r\nAs to the _nurses_, they must be watched constantly after the fourth\r\nyear, and they must be treated with sole reference to the prosperity\r\nof the other trees; _they_ may, therefore, be pruned, or lopped in\r\nany way that will best subserve that end. Of course I am now speaking\r\nof Plantations where the trees are not put nearer to each other than\r\nthree feet, and when, in consequence, they must have _artificial_\r\npruning.\r\n\r\nIn cases where pruning begins _soon enough_, the question which has\r\nbeen raised as to the manner of doing it—whether by _close_ pruning,\r\n_snag_ pruning, or fore-shortening—will not apply. All the principals\r\nshould be _close pruned_ with a sharp instrument, care being taken\r\nnot to wound the bark too extensively. The principle to be kept in\r\nview at all times, when dealing with a Plantation, is, _to subject it\r\nto no sudden changes_, but when pruning is found to be insufficient,\r\nto commence a course of _gradual thinning_, which shall not, in any\r\nconsiderable degree, at any period, _disturb the temperature of the\r\nPlantation_. If this point be duly attended to, and a sound judgment\r\nbe exercised in selecting the principals, the planter’s most sanguine\r\nexpectations will not be disappointed.\r\n\r\nSo far as I have ventured to offer suggestions for the _proper_\r\nmanagement of Plantations, I have intended them to apply to such as are\r\nnot over twenty years of age; but it is well known to all who concern\r\nthemselves in such matters, that a class of Plantations ranging above\r\nthat age, up to forty or fifty, may be met with in various localities,\r\nwhich stands much in need of better “management.” In all cases of great\r\nneglect, which has been continued more than twenty years, the nicest\r\njudgment is necessary. The difficulty is, however, always in proportion\r\nto the _degree_ of neglect. Where the trees have been put in thickly,\r\nand nothing, or almost nothing, has been done, little can be expected\r\neven from the most judicious treatment; but still the means ought to be\r\ntried, for one thing is quite certain, viz., that the longer remedial\r\nsteps are put off, the less chance there must be of their doing any\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIf, when the Plantation has been thus neglected, a person is called in\r\nwho does not fully understand what he is about, irreparable mischief\r\nwill be done: he is almost sure to thin _too freely_. A proprietor of\r\nlong neglected Plantations must, therefore, be well assured beforehand,\r\nthat the person he employs will be guided in the course he takes by\r\ncorrect views, both practical and scientific, upon the whole subject;\r\nand when such is the case, the most suitable and appropriate plans will\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\nShould any one demand of me before I close, some data on which he may\r\njudge whether or not a Plantation is in a condition requiring unusual\r\nattention, I offer the following:\r\n\r\nFirst: If, upon examination, it be found that the trees intended for\r\ntimber have not an aspect and position superior to the others which are\r\naround them:\r\n\r\nSecondly: If, at any period after twenty years from the time of\r\nplanting, it be found difficult to identify and point out the trees\r\nwhich are to be the final crop:\r\n\r\nThirdly: When there are any decided indications of a want of health and\r\nvigour, there is proof sufficient that something more is required to\r\nbe done than has yet been done. The grosser cases of Plantations which\r\nhave never been entered for any purpose, for five, ten, fifteen, or\r\ntwenty years together, need not be pointed at. Every one who sees them\r\nmust perceive the necessity of their being relieved without loss of\r\ntime. No plant, of which we have any knowledge, can exist without light\r\nand air, and in proportion to the extent to which they are excluded\r\nfrom Plantations, will be the injurious effect produced upon the health\r\nof the trees. In fact, it may be laid down as a universal rule, that\r\n_in proportion to the judgment and discrimination which are exercised\r\nin gradually admitting both light and air into Plantations, of almost\r\nevery description_, will be their healthy progress.\r\n\r\nI conclude my remarks on this part of my subject by observing that,\r\nhaving admitted, as I most fully and readily do, that a _few_\r\ninstances may be met with in almost every county where the science of\r\nArboriculture is tolerably well understood, and its principles carried\r\nout, I must still contend that cases enough may be found—First; of a\r\nwant of preparation of the ground: Secondly; of an improper selection\r\nof plants, either as to kind or size: Thirdly; of an unsuitable\r\nadmixture of them: Fourthly; of mistakes committed as to their\r\ndistance from each other: Fifthly; when they are injured for want of\r\nearly attention: Sixthly; when injury is done to them for want of,\r\nor from imprudent, or excessive, thinning, to fully justify me, or\r\nany one else, in bringing before the public the “_mismanagement_” of\r\nPlantations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nHEDGE-ROW TIMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn commencing this, the third part of my subject, I am fully impressed\r\nwith a sense of its magnitude and difficulty; and nothing but a\r\nthorough conviction resting on my own mind, of the truth of the\r\nposition which I have taken with reference to the _present state_, and\r\nthe _present management_ of Hedge-row Timber, would have emboldened\r\nme to give expression to views which cannot but be unpalatable to\r\nmany, however just they may be, and however strong their claim, to the\r\nserious notice of others. I am fully prepared to expect that censure\r\nmay be dealt out by some, in not very measured terms, but this does not\r\nmove me: having nothing but a plain, unvarnished tale to tell, I shall\r\ntell that tale as fearlessly as if I were about to pour sweetest music\r\ninto the ears of those who may read. I know whereof I speak; and while\r\nI have as little fear of any one _successfully attempting to disprove\r\nwhat I shall advance_, as I have at present, I can contemplate, without\r\na single disturbed feeling, the liability to which I shall assuredly\r\nexpose myself, of having sundry missiles thrown at me by those who\r\nare deeply implicated in the present “mismanagement” of this valuable\r\nproperty. Thus much with reference to those who are in offices of\r\ntrust and confidence, as the managers of Woods, Plantations, and\r\n_Hedge-Rows_, if any such shall favour me with a perusal. But I may not\r\nproceed any further, before I say a few words in deprecation of the\r\ndispleasure of a more important class of persons who will, I trust,\r\ndo me the honour to read my “Remarks”; I mean, the proprietors of\r\nHedge-row Timber. To these—or rather to that portion of them who have\r\nhitherto paid little attention to this part of their property—I would\r\nsay, let my observations be “weighed in the balances,” and, if they are\r\n“found wanting,” let these be set against what cannot be called more\r\nthan a venial error—an error of judgment—the strong, the ardent desire\r\nthat I have to see introduced the correction of what I have, at least,\r\n_deemed_ to be, a serious mischief.\r\n\r\nIf Hedge-row Timber has been “mismanaged”—and who can doubt it—on whom\r\nshall the blame fall? As I have more than once said before, _not_ on a\r\nclass of men who, from their education, must necessarily be limited to\r\nthe mechanical duties connected with their office, but on the Owners\r\nof Timber, from whom either directly, or through the agency of persons\r\nduly qualified, such rules and regulations ought to proceed, as would\r\ninsure a better system of management. Practices are allowed, and such\r\na state of things is permitted by the proprietors of Hedge-row Timber,\r\nas abundantly prove that many of them have never either understood its\r\nvalue, or given themselves the trouble to enquire whether it was under\r\na course of suitable treatment or not.\r\n\r\nI have stated that I consider the question which I am handling a\r\ndifficult one. I feel it to be so—not because I have any difficulty\r\nin proving “mismanagement” on the part of those who have to do with\r\nthe timber of our hedges—not because I can feel a _doubt_ that my\r\nstatements will carry conviction along with them; but because I must\r\nnecessarily come into collision, both with the refined tastes, and with\r\nthe prejudices, of many of my readers. For instance: if I assert, as\r\nI do without any hesitation, that many Noblemen and Gentlemen suffer\r\ntheir Hedge-row Timber _to stand much too long_—where is the admirer of\r\nthe beauties of landscape scenery, who will not instantly, and perhaps\r\nindignantly, throw down my book, and charge me with being the most\r\npresumptuous of grumblers, and, as to _taste_, a very heretic!\r\n\r\nIf to such a charge as this I plead “not guilty,” as, after all that\r\ncan be said, I really must do, I am aware that I must be prepared with\r\na very strong defence. I think I am so prepared. My defence will rest\r\non three principal points, which it will be my endeavour to bring\r\nout in the course of my “Remarks: viz.: First; I shall show that the\r\nmagnitude of the sacrifice which arises from Hedge-row Timber being\r\nsuffered to stand so long, is disproportionate to the good resulting\r\nfrom it. Secondly; that the embellishment of a landscape does not\r\nnecessarily include _the perpetuity_ of any one race of timber trees.\r\nAnd thirdly; that the present mode of “mismanaging” Hedge-row Timber,\r\nis a perpetual offence against good taste.”\r\n\r\nAlthough I have arranged my three propositions as above, I do not\r\nintend to bind myself to take them up again, and dispose of them\r\nin consecutive order: I have neither time nor the ability to adapt\r\nmy “remarks” to the niceties of exact logical arrangement; it will\r\nbe sufficient for me, if I shall succeed in leaving upon the minds\r\nof those who may read them, an impression of their truth. If that\r\nresult is arrived at, it surely will be quite sufficient to draw the\r\nparticular attention of proprietors to the subject; which will be more\r\nthan half way towards securing the improvement which is so loudly\r\ncalled for; and that would be as much perhaps, as could at once be\r\nreasonably expected.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to glance for an instant, at the value of the\r\nproperty about which I am writing. Few people, I imagine, have any\r\nproper conception of the aggregate amount. It is, of course, impossible\r\nto offer more than a conjecture on the subject; but probably it is not\r\nless, in England alone, than One Hundred Millions sterling!\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that a course of management which only, in some of\r\nits details, falls short of what it ought to be, would involve, as it\r\naffected such an immense investment, a very serious loss to somebody.\r\nHow much more serious then, must it be, if, not only some of the minor\r\ndetails of management, but the entire course of treatment, be radically\r\nwrong, as it respects a considerable proportion, and very defective\r\nindeed as to the remainder? It would be a waste of time to stop here\r\nwith a view to argue, in proof of what must appear to every one to be\r\nnothing less than an _axiom_.\r\n\r\nThat proprietors of Hedge-row Timber are not solely influenced by\r\nconsiderations of taste in their management of it, is most evident\r\nto an experienced eye; but the _heavy loss_, which is consequent\r\nupon allowing it to stand so long, has, probably, never been fairly\r\nunderstood by them, or some efforts would have been made to prevent it.\r\n\r\nIf a Nobleman or Gentleman merely suffered his timber to stand _beyond\r\nmaturity_ in the neighbourhood of his house, or on the domain where\r\nhis mansion stood, however extensive it might be:—or if he generously\r\nspared the trees which, though at a great distance from his residence,\r\nwere so placed as to enrich, if not constitute the principal beauty\r\nof, some splendid scene in nature, no one, who possesses a grain of\r\ntaste, would regret it, but, on the contrary, would feel grateful for\r\nthis sacrifice to one of the most hallowed emotions of the heart,\r\nwhen surveying the Creator’s works, which are all perfect; and the\r\ntouches of whose pencil are all loveliness—whether as seen in the\r\nrefreshing beauty of foliage which distinguishes the vernal season, or\r\nthe mellowed minglings of Autumn’s enchanting exhibitions: but when it\r\nis considered, that a majority of the Nobility and Gentry, thus treat\r\ntheir _remote_ and even _most distant_ estates, where besides, there\r\nis nothing particularly attractive in the scenery, the propriety of\r\nthe course which they pursue may, I think, be fairly questioned. Some\r\nother reason therefore, than a deference to the principles of good\r\ntaste must be found, in order to account for their conduct; and in\r\nlooking round for a reason I should say, a good deal must be set down\r\nto _indifference_, and _pure neglect_. This I say, because it will\r\n_not_ admit of question, that _a most extensive loss_ arises, both to\r\nthemselves, and the community in consequence; and it is not often that\r\ngentlemen wilfully close their eyes to the importance of pecuniary\r\nconsiderations, except there is some powerful and justifiable reason\r\nwhich leads them to do so.\r\n\r\nWithout speculating further as to the precise cause, it is certain that\r\nthe amount of property which is thus wasted, absolutely wasted—and\r\nin almost every case without any advantage to any party whatever—is\r\nenormous, as it would be easy to show by statistical details and\r\ncalculations, applying to any estate where this _horror of felling\r\ntimber_ may have existed for half a century. Were this accurately done,\r\nthere could not but be such a showing, as would fully establish the\r\ntruth of what I have advanced. There would indeed be no difficulty\r\nin fixing upon an estate, in any locality, which would illustrate my\r\nposition, but I shall not here attempt it, for various reasons, which\r\nwill be obvious to all. It would be travelling beyond the bounds of\r\nlegitimate remark, were I to refer _to any particular estate_, and\r\nany other references, however accurate in point of fact, would not\r\nbe sufficiently specific. I would rather recommend any gentleman\r\nwhose estate may be pretty well covered with timber, already, or long\r\nsince, arrived at maturity, to make as near an estimate as he can of\r\nits present value, or procure it to be made; and having calculated\r\nthe amount which would be exhibited of the gross sum at _compound\r\ninterest_, for any given term of years, then let him “try back,” and\r\nendeavour to ascertain what, according to this mode of calculation, may\r\nhave been his individual loss. But when a gentleman coolly makes up his\r\nmind to allow his Timber Trees to go to decay without ever _intending_,\r\nor _wishing_, to make any thing of them, why then, in that case,\r\nnothing can be advanced, but to suggest the means of protracting their\r\nexistence to the longest possible period.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to do homage to the feeling which prompts a\r\ngentleman to make so large a sacrifice to taste, as to suffer the\r\ngreater part of his Hedge-row and detached Timber to perish by slow\r\ndecay; but if it can be proved that he acts upon _mistaken views_,\r\nand that, by a better system of management, his object might be\r\ngained without the very serious pecuniary loss which, on the other\r\nplan, he must necessarily suffer, it cannot be doubted that such a\r\nsuggestion ought to command his instant attention. It will hardly\r\nbe denied, I think, by any one who fully understands the subject,\r\nthat _such a regular succession_ of Timber Trees in the Fields and\r\nHedge-rows might be secured by a proper system of management, as\r\nwould sustain and perpetuate the beauties of the landscape, while, at\r\nthe same time, _nearly_ every tree should be taken in its turn as it\r\narrived at maturity. It would, of course, require an entire change\r\nof system, or rather of practice, and the change would necessarily\r\ninvolve a considerable outlay, inasmuch as a constant supervision\r\nwould be required from the time of planting, but whatever might be the\r\nexpense, it would be amply returned; and whatever might be the apparent\r\ndifficulty, it would not be such but that skill and perseverance would\r\nbe sure to surmount it.\r\n\r\nIf then the objection which would be made by the man of taste, to\r\nthe felling of Hedge-row and detached Timber, could be effectually\r\nobviated, by providing a regular succession to take the place of such\r\nas might be cut down—for the difference of a few yards in the _site_\r\nneed hardly be taken into the account—one great difficulty, at least,\r\nwould be overcome; and instead of wasting, as is done under the present\r\npractice, a quantity of Timber, the aggregate value of which makes\r\nit an object of _national_ importance, the growers might take down\r\ntheir trees when they arrived at maturity, and thus produce a constant\r\nsupply of the best sort for home consumption: and it will not surely be\r\nargued by the most determined advocate for free trade, that it would\r\nbe for the interest of the English Gentleman to give a higher price\r\nfor Foreign Pine than he would be able to make of home-grown Oak! No!\r\nemphatically No!! When the navy requires it, by all means let it be so\r\nappropriated, and if the demand be sufficient from that quarter, the\r\nrelative price will be kept up, but let not English heart of Oak be\r\nreduced in our home market below the value of an inferior article,\r\nwith all the costs of transit added to the original price. This were\r\nindeed to show a most extravagant and unaccountable preference of a\r\ncrotchet over the obvious dictates of reason, and the suggestions of\r\nprudence. It would indeed be to drop the substance, and grasp at the\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nI trust I may now conclude that I have satisfactorily proved,\r\nnot only that the “magnitude of the sacrifice which the present\r\npractice involves is disproportionate to the good resulting,” but\r\nthat “the embellishment of a landscape does not necessarily include\r\nthe perpetuity of any one race of Trees.” In handling the remaining\r\nproposition, and in endeavouring to prove that the present treatment of\r\nHedge-row Timber is “a perpetual offence against good taste,” I shall\r\nat the same time, be accumulating evidence in support of the other two.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to remark before I proceed any further, that when I speak\r\nof Timber being allowed to stand too long, and of the consequent heavy\r\nloss upon it to the proprietors, I refer to such as belongs to the\r\nNobility and Gentry, for, although their example has in this, as well\r\nas in every thing else, _some_ effect upon those below them, it does\r\nhappen that, in this respect at least, the _middle classes_ are wiser\r\nin their day and generation than their superiors, the Timber upon small\r\nestates being generally taken down at an earlier period than on large\r\nones. There is indeed among the higher orders—of course with a few\r\nexceptions—a prejudice against felling Timber, older than the oldest\r\nTimber Tree in existence; and as _strong_ as the most enthusiastic\r\nadmirer of the beauties of landscape scenery can desire it to be: and\r\nso far is this feeling carried, that, by many, Timber of the most\r\nunsightly character, and in situations where it can be associated with\r\nno idea connected with the scenery, is religiously spared, and spared\r\nlong after it has ceased to be either useful or ornamental where it\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nHaving ventured thus strongly to point out the loss to proprietors,\r\nI will now show, by an example, how the community is affected by the\r\ndisinclination to fell one particular kind of timber; viz., the Ash.\r\nThis tree is hardly ever cut down before it becomes exceedingly tender;\r\nand as almost every agricultural implement is either wholly, or partly\r\ncomposed of it, the consumers—those who wear out the wagons and carts,\r\nthe ploughs and harrows—are proportionate sufferers; for it cannot\r\nfor a moment be supposed, that timber which is in the last stage of\r\ndecay, or indeed, approaching to that stage, will wear half so long\r\nas that which is cut down as soon as it has arrived at full maturity.\r\nThe period when it has done so, will be indicated to a practiced eye,\r\nat a single glance, even with that class of trees which has had fair\r\nplay; or in other words, where _premature decay_ has not been brought\r\non by mal-treatment. But the latter class is by far the most numerous,\r\nand it requires very little either of science, or of knowledge of a\r\npractical kind, to teach a man how to deal with them. It is of no use\r\nto let them stand. If they are not wanted for ornament, the sooner they\r\nare felled the better, for the process of decay is very rapid in this\r\nparticular tree. Their early removal is further necessary, because they\r\ninjuriously affect the Farmer in another way, as I will show.\r\n\r\nThe roots, &c. of one single Ash Tree are said to amount to a million\r\nin number, and to extend themselves as far all round the bole as the\r\nbranches. I do not profess to be able to form a very decided opinion\r\nas to the number of the roots, rootlets, fibres, &c., but I have seen\r\nquite enough of the habits of the tree to convince me, that the roots\r\nextend themselves much farther than is here supposed; and it is well\r\nknown to all farmers, that to a distance far beyond this, vegetation\r\nis almost totally destroyed; and that, near a Hedge-row (dividing\r\ntwo arable fields) which is filled with filthy, scabbed, stunted Ash\r\nTrees, which, from “mismanagement,” have been brought into such a\r\ncondition as positively to be making no progress at all, _sow what he\r\nmay_, the farmer can never _reap_ any thing: and yet these unsightly\r\nthings, which are the latest of all other of our common deciduous\r\ntrees, in getting their foliage, and almost the earliest out again,\r\nare suffered to linger out their _feeble_, but _blighting_ existence,\r\nuntil by slow decay they become so unsound, that the wind blows them\r\ndown, and they are fit for nothing but the fire! or, if they do not\r\nactually reach this stage, they are only cut down because the owner has\r\nthe fear of such a result before his eyes! A volume might be written\r\nwith reference to this particular tree, were it necessary to take up\r\nevery one of the points which present themselves, as condemning the\r\npresent practice in its management, but that is not needed, for the\r\n_Ash Tree_ is so generally met with in a diseased state, that it may be\r\nconsidered as the subject of grosser “_mis_-management” than any other\r\nof our domestic trees. If any one still deny this, let him look round\r\nhim and say, why Hedge-rows so abound every where, in puny, sickly,\r\nAsh Timber, which _cannot possibly attain to a useful size_: and when\r\nhe has confessed the fact, that they really _do_ exist in that state,\r\nI will reiterate the assertion, that the cause is bad management! If\r\n_the present condition of Hedge-row Ash, generally_, does not prove\r\n“_mis_-management,” I am at a loss to know what does, for when the\r\ndifferent kinds are planted upon a congenial soil, _if they be properly\r\ntreated_, they will continue to grow, more or less rapidly, according\r\nto circumstances, and for a longer or shorter period, as the natural\r\nterm of their existence may rule: but as they are now treated, _they\r\nare never healthy_, for the principle of decay is introduced at a very\r\nearly stage of their existence, and in consequence, premature old age\r\nis brought on. To the absence of early training, may be attributed\r\nmuch of what is seen to be wrong in the present condition and quality\r\nof Hedge-row Timber, but much more to the vile practice of _mutilating\r\nthe trees_, which almost every where obtains. There is, indeed, in some\r\nquarters, such perfect indifference manifested about the well-being of\r\nthe trees, that _free licence_ is allowed to the tenants of the land to\r\ndo as they will with them: and _free use_ they make of it, as may well\r\nbe supposed, and as is abundantly evident in all such places. And why\r\nshould it be otherwise? It has so long been the practice, and it is so\r\nfar out of their way to really understand the matter, that farmers may\r\nwell be excused. They cut off the roots, and reduce the extent of the\r\nbranches, of their enemy, in _self defence_; and without having the\r\nremotest idea that they are doing so serious an injury to the property\r\nof their landlords. This is fully proved by the fact, that they\r\ntreat their own trees in precisely the same way. It is, then, to the\r\nindifference that has hitherto been manifested by the proprietors of\r\nHedge-row Timber, and the consequent prevalence of mistaken views on\r\nthe subject, that the present state of things is to be attributed. Some\r\ngentlemen do indeed introduce into their Agreements, clauses affecting\r\nto provide against the _mischievous pruning_ which is here condemned,\r\nbut, except in the neighbourhood of a mansion, where a strict look out\r\nis generally kept, they are quite _inoperative_—they are a dead letter,\r\nfor not only does the _pruning_ go on, but, as I have just hinted, the\r\ntrees are often attacked _below too_, and deprived of their _roots_, as\r\nwell as their branches, thus cutting off their supply of nutriment from\r\nthe atmosphere above, and from their legitimate sources of supply from\r\nthe soil. Both these practices ought to be _most strictly interdicted_.\r\n\r\nMy indignation and regret have a thousand times been excited, on\r\nseeing the noblest of all our Hedge-row Trees, the Oak, clipped of its\r\nbeautiful proportions, and reduced by repeated _snaring_, as it is most\r\naptly called, to the capacity and shape of a huge _besom_! and by this\r\ntruly infamous treatment, deprived not only of all its scenic beauty,\r\nbut actually of its specific character! and, if not altogether stopped\r\nin its growth, rendered utterly worthless for application to the chief\r\nend and purpose for which it is adapted and intended. I need not say,\r\nthat I mean—the building of ships.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject there ought not to be two opinions: neither will\r\nthere, among those who really understand it; but it is much to be\r\nlamented, that a very large portion of the Hedge-row Timber of this\r\ncountry is in the hands of persons who either do _not_ understand the\r\nmanagement of it, or who are indifferent about it. It very frequently\r\nhappens, that there is no person but the Land Steward, who can make any\r\npretensions to a correct judgment in the matter, and he has often quite\r\nenough to attend to, without so responsible a duty as this is—being\r\nadded to his department. He therefore, very naturally, attends to those\r\nduties which are indispensable; and as for the Timber, &c. &c. he only\r\nthinks about _it_ seriously, when he wishes to ascertain _how much of\r\nit he can turn to profit_.\r\n\r\nEvery considerable estate ought to have a person upon it, whose\r\nattention shall _exclusively_ be devoted to the supervision of the\r\nWoods, Plantations and Hedge Rows, &c. He should be a _well-educated_\r\nand an intelligent man; and should be so _well-paid for his services_,\r\nas to feel that his employer has a moral claim upon him, for the\r\nentire devotion of his _mind_, as well as his physical powers, to the\r\nefficient discharge of his duties.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry into the _natural history_ of Hedge-row Timber, if I may so\r\nspeak of it, would furnish a field for highly interesting remark, and\r\nit would assuredly remove any doubts that might remain in the minds of\r\nthose who have gone no farther than to _suspect_ that the management of\r\nit has been bad. When it is considered that the Timber of our Hedges\r\nis the product of _chance_, or even worse than that, that it has grown\r\nto what it is, notwithstanding that it has been subjected to the most\r\nbarbarous treatment; it is impossible not to perceive, that if it had\r\nbeen watched and tended as it _ought_ to have been, it would have\r\nequalled any thing that could have been conceived of it.\r\n\r\nThe classes of trees which may be met with in our Hedge-rows are\r\nvarious, and are so situated in many places, as to really give rise to\r\nthe idea just now referred to—that they are found there, more as a\r\nmatter of chance, than of design: and this may be assigned, partly at\r\nleast, as the reason why they have been so neglected, or so shamefully\r\nused. If they had been planted, and if any calculation at all were made\r\nbefore planting, it might be imagined that a gentleman would wish to\r\nascertain what would be the _surest_ mode of raising a class of fine\r\nunblemished trees, whether they were Oaks, or Elms, or Ash, or any\r\nother kind; and having carefully, and at some expense, introduced them\r\ninto his hedges, it is difficult to suppose, that he would either leave\r\nthem to shift for themselves, or to the tender mercies of their natural\r\nenemies, the occupiers of the land on which they might be growing: it\r\nis therefore more than probable, that a considerable proportion of them\r\nare in the hedges more by accident than any thing else. But however\r\nthat may be, the fact remains the same: they are, very generally,\r\nstanding memorials of the ignorance of the men in whose care they have\r\nbeen placed, and a triumphant vindication of the propriety of my title.\r\n\r\nIf Hedge-row Trees have length of bole, they have it—not because they\r\nwere properly trained and assisted when they were young, and therefore\r\nneeded it, but—in consequence, most likely, of indiscriminate lopping\r\nand pruning at some former period of their growth, the fruits of which,\r\nalthough now invisible to the unpracticed eye, will appear hereafter,\r\nto the dismay, and serious loss, of the person who may have to saw them\r\nup.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere given my opinion very freely on the subject of\r\npruning, but as it will be necessary just to glance at it, in\r\nconnection with Hedge-row Timber, I will again take the Oak, which is\r\nalmost the only tree that I would recommend for hedges. As this noble\r\ntree will naturally grow of a bush-like shape, when standing alone,\r\nit is absolutely necessary that it be pruned, or it will not acquire\r\nsufficient length of stem. I am not, therefore, the wholesale condemner\r\nof pruning, even of Hedge-row Trees, but I would have no pruning done\r\nafter they had arrived at a certain age—say, twenty years: all work of\r\nthis kind should be done during the _infancy_ of the tree, or not at\r\nall. I would much sooner _cut down a tree, if it had not sufficient\r\nlength of bole_, and trust to the chance of raising a better _from\r\nits stool_, than take off _large branches, particularly if it was not\r\nover thirty years of age_. Indeed the former method of repairing the\r\nmischief of long neglect, appears to me as one peculiarly adapted to\r\nthe circumstances in which some estates are placed, as to the timber;\r\nand I should not hesitate to adopt it upon an extensive scale. I\r\nhave, in fact, seen many estates where I should cut down Oaks very\r\nfreely, which have _not_ length of bole, or which, from some cause or\r\nother, are _not healthy_; even though they might not produce timber\r\nenough to pay for the cost of cutting. There are estates within less\r\nthan two hours ride of my residence, which are _apparently_ well\r\nstocked with timber, but it is of such quality that, were it under\r\nmy own management, I should instantly cut it down; and from a large\r\nproportion of the stools I should train up a new race of trees. These\r\nwould, if well attended to, grow into a class and quality of timber,\r\nvery little, if at all, inferior to maiden trees; while, on the\r\nother hand, from those which are standing, _whatever length of time\r\nthey may remain_, nothing can be expected, but a _small quantity of\r\ntimber, and that of middling quality_. But to return to _pruning_. In\r\na Wood, or a Plantation, trees will draw up each other to a certain\r\nlength, and many of the lateral branches, from the exclusion of light\r\nand air, will die, and some of them will fall off; this is, of course,\r\n_natural_ pruning: but in a Hedge-row, they have no such help, they\r\nwill, therefore, require _artificial_ pruning; which should commence\r\nat the time of planting, and continue until it can be seen that they\r\nwill assuredly acquire ample length of bole. The kind of pruning which\r\nis here advocated _cannot possibly do any harm, if it be well done_,\r\nand done at a proper season. The soundness of an Oak will in no degree\r\nbe impaired by it; and consequently, it will be, on all accounts, more\r\nserviceable for naval purposes, than if it were not pruned; for it will\r\nnot surely be contended, that clearness of grain, and length of stem,\r\nare not likely to recommend it to the ship-builder. So far from having\r\na doubt upon this point, I am of opinion that timber thus carefully\r\ntrained, will be, on every account, _incomparably superior_ to that\r\nwhich is at present obtained from our Hedge-rows;—it will exhibit a\r\nhealthy developement, from the pith to the alburnum; so that wherever\r\nthere is a _bend_, a _crook_, or a _knee_, in it, the purchaser will\r\nbe sure that it is _sound_—whereas the very opposite is the case with\r\nby far the greater part of that which now comes into the market. The\r\nreckless extent to which the abominable practice of pruning, lopping,\r\nor _snaring_—whichever it may be called—is carried, renders the\r\nconversion of timber a very hazardous speculation, and should long\r\nsince have taught the growers of it, to avoid the commission of such an\r\nerror themselves, and to impose a heavy penalty on all those belonging\r\nto them, who should be found guilty of it.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate a little further the statement here made, and the\r\nopinion here given, it may be remarked, that the effect of such a\r\nvile mutilation of Hedge-row Timber as is, in almost every quarter,\r\npermitted, is seen and felt most in those very parts where strength\r\nis most wanted, and which, _if sound_, would render the timber so much\r\nthe more valuable. It is on the outsides of _bends_ or _knees_, that\r\nblemishes are so frequently found, and which are often so considerable,\r\nas to reduce the value of a valuable crook to almost nothing.\r\n\r\nThese defects in timber are sometimes so far within the body of the\r\ntree, as to elude the scrutiny of the keenest eye, proving, in some\r\nvery old trees, that pruning is not an evil of modern date. In a still\r\ngreater proportion, as to the whole quantity, however, the eye of\r\nShip-builders, or Timber Merchants—all of whom have frequently been\r\nbitten—will detect, from external appearances, the _snag-pruning,\r\ncovered over both with wood and bark_; and consequently, they protect\r\nthemselves as well as they can in their purchases, against the\r\ncontingency of unsound timber, by shaping their offers accordingly.\r\nThis, of course, affects the _seller_ in no inconsiderable degree, and\r\nis one other reason why he should put a stop to the practice of pruning\r\naltogether, except when it could be done under the eye of his own Wood\r\nManager.\r\n\r\nThe last point connected with Hedge-row Trees which I shall mention,\r\nis the _planting_ of them; but upon this part of the subject, I shall\r\nnot say much. I might, indeed, have passed it over in silence, and\r\nstill have fulfilled the requirements of my Title-page; but inasmuch as\r\nthe planting of Hedge-row Timber, _must_ form a part of an _improved_\r\nsystem of management, however it may be left out of the present\r\npractice, it does not seem quite right to overlook it altogether.\r\n\r\nIf Hedge-row Trees are to succeed at all, they must have a _good\r\nstart_; and if they are to have a _good start_, there must, of\r\nnecessity, be some trouble bestowed in the preparation of the site on\r\nwhich they are to be planted. In the fences of _new inclosures_ there\r\nwill be no difficulty at all. If the border, as it is often called,\r\nbe well prepared for the _quick_, it will be in a right state for an\r\nOak Tree; and it would really appear to be a piece of unaccountable\r\nneglect—an inexplainable circumstance, as the act of a man of\r\nbusiness—if a tract of land were to be enclosed, and new fences put\r\ndown, without the opportunity being seized to plant a suitable number\r\nof Oak Trees. I say, of _Oak_ Trees, because I am persuaded that it\r\nwould be very difficult indeed to find a locality where any other kind\r\nof timber, other circumstances being equal, would be likely to pay\r\nso well. In the line of every Quick fence, then, I should certainly\r\nrecommend that healthy Oak Plants, of four years old, which have been\r\nat least twice transplanted in the nursery, should be inserted, at a\r\ndistance from each other—say, of twenty yards—and if they are properly\r\nguarded and _nursed_, nothing is more certain, than that they will\r\nbecome a fine race of trees. But planting young Oaks, or young trees\r\nof any kind, in an _old Hedge-row_, is quite a different affair. It\r\nis indeed an undertaking involving real difficulty, and requiring a\r\nvery considerable degree of skill on the part of the workman, and of\r\nfirmness and determination on the part of his employer.\r\n\r\nIt would be found all but impossible to rear a young Oak _in the exact\r\nline_ of an old and vigorous thorn hedge; but there are many situations\r\nwhich present much less difficulty. For example: In the year when a\r\nhedge is plashed or laid, where there is a moderate space on the bank\r\nwhich has been raised when the quick was first planted—say, of a foot\r\nor more—there will be room for a tree; and in all cases, where the\r\nbank has not been _pared down_, there will be more room than is here\r\nsupposed. Many other places, such as the sides of the banks of large\r\nditches, the gaps of hedges, &c. &c. may be met with, on almost every\r\nestate, which ought to be filled with Oaks, after the ground has been\r\nprepared in a suitable manner.\r\n\r\nBut, _a previous preparation of the plant is necessary_. Planting in\r\nHedge-rows, where planting has been done at all, has been performed\r\nin the same ill-adapted way as every thing else relating to timber.\r\nThe plants have been taken out of the nursery, indiscriminately with\r\nothers, which have been intended for close planting; instead of having\r\nsuch, and such only, as have been _twice or thrice shifted_, and each\r\ntime into a more exposed situation, and wider apart, in order that\r\nthey might acquire more fibrous roots, and induration of bark, and\r\nthus be enabled to cope with, and surmount, the disadvantages of their\r\nnew position. Another point, which has previously been hinted at, is\r\nthe _guarding_ of the trees. No matter what the expense may be, if a\r\ngentleman determines to have Hedge-row Timber, _he must guard it well_.\r\nIt stands more in need of the watchful eye of the Wood Manager than\r\nalmost any thing else: in fact, it is of little or no use planting at\r\nall, if a good and sufficient guard fence be not immediately put down:\r\nbut, having put in good plants, and effectually protected them, I say\r\nagain, I know of no reason why Hedge-row Timber should not thrive and\r\nprosper, and, ultimately, turn out as sound, as any other. That it is\r\nnot so with the race of Timber Trees now growing, except to a very\r\nlimited extent, I assert without fear of contradiction; and, with\r\nthe same confidence, I plead this fact as my justification, when I\r\nre-assert, that their treatment, from first to last, is neither more\r\nnor less, than a course of gross “MISMANAGEMENT.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted by J.
