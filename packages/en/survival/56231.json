C.”\r\n\r\nA Book For Boys\r\n\r\nBy Prof. James De Mille\r\n\r\nThe Author Of “The Dodge Club,”\r\n\r\nIllustrated\r\n\r\nBoston: Lee And Shepard, Publishers\r\n\r\n1871\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO\r\n\r\nWILLIE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “B. O. W. C.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n_The “B. O. W. C.,” with their History, Mystery, and Wonderful Doings;\r\nand how an aged African became elevated to the Dignity of “Grand\r\nPanjandrum.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the long winter session, the approach of the spring vacation\r\nhad been eagerly welcomed at the Grand Pré School. It was only a short\r\nrecess, and the majority of the boys would not be able to go home; but\r\nsuch as it was, its advent created the greatest delight. On a pleasant\r\nevening in May the examinations were over; little knots of boys were\r\ngathered jubilantly in various places, bonfires were blazing, squibs\r\nfizzing, crackers snapping, and everything and everybody were as noisy\r\nand as jolly as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, and immediately after tea, the “B. O W. C.”\r\n had called a meeting in the Rawdons’ rooms. Who or what the “B. O. W.\r\nC.” is, or was, will be explained on a future occasion; let it suffice\r\nfor the present that the “B. O. W. C.” called a meeting, and the\r\nRawdons’ rooms had the honor, of receiving that august assemblage. Not\r\nthat it was very numerous. Only four or five could be counted; but then\r\nwhat they lacked a number, they made up in quality and in style. The\r\nutmost had been done to bring the rooms up to the level of so great an\r\noccasion. The table had been turned upside down, and transformed into\r\na dais; the book-case had been, covered over with the table-cloth; the\r\ncouch had been placed on one end in the corner; and in the middle of the\r\nroom was a flour barrel covered with red flannel, on which was placed a\r\nphrenological bust. Added to this, the room was darkened--a smoky lamp\r\nshedding a feeble and fitful ray over the scene, and dimly disclosing\r\nfour figures at one end.\r\n\r\nThese four figures were all dressed in white. The costume was a simple,\r\nbut a highly effective one. It consisted apparently of a sheet thrown\r\nover the head and falling to the feet, with two holes for the eyes. In\r\nthis attire the four figures bore not a little resemblance to some of\r\nthose orders of monks which exist in Europe. The table, which lay on the\r\nfloor, legs upward, with the addition of the ottoman, served as a dais,\r\non which stood a figure with an immense militia captain’s sword in his\r\nhand. On each side was also a figure holding a huge wooden battle-axe,\r\nwhile the fourth stood between the dais and the bust.\r\n\r\nSoon the silence was disturbed by a knock at the door communicating with\r\nthe bed-room. The boy near the bust gave it three smart raps, upon which\r\nthe door opened, and a figure entered clothed like the others in the\r\nroom. On entering he made a low bow, and then stood erect.\r\n\r\nThe four figures in the room raised their hands to their faces with a\r\npeculiar gesture.\r\n\r\n“Blood!” said they in solemn tones.\r\n\r\n“Thunder!” said the boy at the door, making the same gesture.\r\n\r\n“Is the Grand Panjandrum with you, Venerable Warden?” said the figure on\r\nthe dais.\r\n\r\n“He is, Most Venerable Patriarch.”\r\n\r\n“Let him enter.”\r\n\r\nAt this the Venerable Warden left the room, and in a few moments\r\nreappeared, ushering in the personage alluded to as the Grand\r\nPanjandrum.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Panjandrum was an aged gentleman of color, whose wrinkled face\r\nwas enlivened by an irrepressible comicality of expression, which not\r\neven the solemnity of this occasion could quell. He was arrayed in a\r\ncollege cap and gown, with a Master’s red hood and long bands. His face\r\nwas a study. He was evidently doing his best to exhibit the deepest\r\nsolemnity of expression, but his droll, keen, twinkling eyes darted\r\nfurtively about, with an intense relish of the scene before him, and his\r\nefforts at gravity were sadly disturbed by the broad grin which, from\r\ntime to time, would flash out irrepressibly over the dark background\r\nof his face. After a few furtive glances he bowed; and then, with an\r\naudible chuckle, he awaited further proceedings.\r\n\r\n“Grand Panjandrum,” said the figure on the dais, in an impressive voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, what?” said the other, in a tone of rebuke.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah,--yes, mos’wossifle,” he added, correcting himself. A grin\r\nbroke out over his face, which, however, was instantly checked by a\r\ndemure cough.\r\n\r\n“Grand Panjandrum, you have heard our map-dates.”\r\n\r\n“Mandates?” said the other, in a puzzled tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes,--orders.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah, mos’ wossifle.”\r\n\r\n“Have you carried out the instructions of the Venerable Brethren?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah, mos’ wospeful.”\r\n\r\n“Did you get the turkeys?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah.”\r\n\r\n“How many? Six?”\r\n\r\n“No, sah.”\r\n\r\n“What! not six?”\r\n\r\n“No, sah.”\r\n\r\n“How many, then?”\r\n\r\n“Ten,” said the other, with a chuckle and a grin of triumph.\r\n\r\n“O-h!” said the first speaker; while a titter ran round among the\r\nothers. “H’m! Very well, and what else?”\r\n\r\n“Spring chickens.”\r\n\r\n“How many?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Very well. And how?”\r\n\r\n“Broiled, sah.”\r\n\r\n“Any tongue?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah, three.”\r\n\r\n“And the ham?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah.”\r\n\r\n“Nuts?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah.”\r\n\r\n“Raisins?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah.”\r\n\r\n“Crackers? Cheese? Figs? Cake?” “Yes, sah, mos’ wossifle.”\r\n\r\n“And what about the drink? Have you prepared the lemonade?”\r\n\r\n“No, sah.”\r\n\r\n“No! Why not?”\r\n\r\n“No lemons, sah.”\r\n\r\n“That’s bad. And there is no drink, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. sah. Ginger beer.”\r\n\r\n“Ginger beer. H’m! that will do,” said the Venerable Patriarch,\r\nsolemnly. “How much have you?”\r\n\r\n“Ten gallons, mos’ wossifle.”\r\n\r\n“What else have you?”\r\n\r\n“Ten mince pies, twelve apple pies, a basket of tarts, a tin dipper, an\r\niron pot, an iron spoon,” said the Grand Panjandrum, rapidly enumerating\r\nthe various items. “Fact,” he continued, carried away by the ardor of\r\nthe moment, “I’se got most nigh eberyting. Gracious sakes! you’ll open\r\nyour blessed eyes, mind I tell you! But what are you gwine to do about\r\nde bread and butter? Tell you what, boys! you’ve clean forgot de most\r\n’portant of all.”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” cried the Venerable Patriarch, in an indignant voice, rapping\r\nhis sword against the leg of the table.\r\n\r\n“The sakes now! how you _do_ go on!” said the Grand Panjandrum, with a\r\nbroad grin.\r\n\r\n“No levity,” said the Venerable Patriarch, in a stern voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah,” said the other, assuming an expression of awful solemnity.\r\n\r\n“Venerable Warden!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Most Venerable Patriarch.”\r\n\r\n“The audience, is over! Escort the Grand Panjandrum to the outer world.”\r\n\r\nThe Venerable Warden bowed, and led the way out, followed by his sable\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the door closed behind them than the scene underwent a\r\nsudden change. With a shout, the four figures flung off their white\r\ndraperies, and kicked them into a corner of the room. Then they drew\r\nback the curtains, replaced the table and couch, while the light that\r\nnow came into the room showed the laughing faces of four boys, which had\r\nnothing in common with the sepulchral figures that had taken part in the\r\nlate scene.\r\n\r\nTwo of these boys were big, brawny, broad-shouldered fellows, with\r\nRoman features, and dark, curling hair. They very closely resembled one\r\nanother. These were the two Rawdons, to whom the rooms belonged. The\r\nelder was named Bruce, and the younger Arthur. Of the others, one was\r\ntall and slight, Tom Crawford by name; and the other was small and\r\nslight, and was called Phil Kennedy.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah, boys!” said Phil. “Isn’t old Solomon a perfect brick of an\r\nold darkey? Do you fairly realize the fact that we are to have ten\r\nturkeys,--ten, my boys, instead of six?”\r\n\r\n“And the spring chickens!” said Tom Crawford.\r\n\r\n“And the mince pies!” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“And the ginger beer!” cried Arthur.\r\n\r\n“The encampment, of the ‘B. O. W. C.’ is going to be a grand success,”\r\n said Bruce. “It will be memorable forever in the history of the school.”\r\n\r\n“We ought to have a grand bonfire, and burn our Latin Grammars, before\r\nstarting,” said Tom Crawford.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Phil Kennedy, “and our Arithmetics too. I’d like to burn all\r\nthe Arithmetics in the world.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Arthur, “don’t let us have a bonfire. Let us have a\r\nburial, with a solemn procession, and a real burial service.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what’ll we bury?”\r\n\r\n“The Latin Grammar.”\r\n\r\n“No, Cæsar.”\r\n\r\n“No, the Arithmetic.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s bury them all; that is the best plan,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” cried all; and a confused medley of proposals arose, in which all\r\nwere talking together. In the midst of the uproar the door opened, and\r\nthe Venerable Warden made his appearance. Throwing off his white robe,\r\nhe disclosed the fair, round face of a fresh, handsome boy, with merry,\r\nmischievous eyes, and curling golden hair. That busy brain of his had\r\nbeen prolific in all sorts of plans dear to boys, while his generous\r\nnature and frank, pleasant manner made Bart Darner the favorite of Grand\r\nPré School.\r\n\r\n“O, Bart,” said Tom Crawford, “what about that powder?”\r\n\r\nBart left the room for a moment, and returned with a package under his\r\narm.\r\n\r\n“The powder?” said he. “It’s all right. I’ve got it in my room.”\r\n\r\n“And the rods?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ve got the rods too.”\r\n\r\n“Any matches?”\r\n\r\n“Matches? Of course not.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what’ll we do for lights and fires?”\r\n\r\n“I hope you don’t mean to say that you would dream of taking _matches_,”\r\n said Bart, in a voice of solemn rebuke.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Who ever heard of matches in an Encampment of Knights? No,\r\nboys, flint and steel is the thing for us. That’s what I’ve got; and\r\nI’ve made some first-rate tinder, and a lot of sulphur lights. Besides,\r\nI’ve got something to surprise you.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“The dresses.”\r\n\r\n“Dresses?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; come to my room, and I’ll show you what I’ve got. It wouldn’t do\r\nfor us to go out and be brigands in ordinary jackets and trousers, I\r\nhope. Why,” he concluded, in a tone of rebuke, “it would be infamous.”\r\n\r\n“And have you got any dresses in your room?” said Bruce.’\r\n\r\n“Yes; come along and take a look at them.”\r\n\r\nOff went the five with a shout, and going up a flight of stairs, they\r\nsoon entered Bart Darner’s room. Here Bart brought out a bundle from the\r\nbed-room, and opening it, he proudly displayed its contents. There were\r\nfive red shirts, each of which had a huge white cross on the back; five\r\nbelts; and five felt hats, each of which was decorated with a feather.\r\nAs he displayed these articles one by one, the boys were struck dumb\r\nwith admiration, while Bart’s eyes glowed with delight.\r\n\r\n“Don’t say anything,” said he, “but try them on.”\r\n\r\nBart locked the door carefully, and then they all arrayed themselves in\r\nthe new costume. Soon five figures stood there with their red shirts and\r\nplunged hats, looking like so many juvenile Garibaldians.\r\n\r\n“You see, these belts will do first rate for pistols, and daggers, and\r\nthat sort of thing,” said Bart.\r\n\r\nThe other boys said nothing. Astonishment and delight deprived them\r\nof words; but each stood looking, first at himself, and then at his\r\ncompanions, in mute admiration.\r\n\r\n“But how in the world did you manage it, Bart? Where did you get them\r\nall?” asked Tom Crawford.\r\n\r\n“O, I found the shirts down in Brown’s,” said Bart, “and picked out the\r\nsmallest ones. I had them altered, and got Maggie Lunt to sew on the\r\ncrosses. I begged some old ostrich feathers from. Mrs. Porter, and of\r\ncourse the hats could be got anywhere. They’re rather large, but we can\r\nput bits of paper inside the lining, you know, and make them fit well\r\nenough. They’ll do for the woods.”\r\n\r\n“Do for the woods!” cried Bruce Rawdon. “I should think they would, and\r\nfor other places, too. Boys, don’t let’s hide our light under a bushel.\r\nI move that we have a grand procession at once.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” cried all. “Let’s go down now. The fellows are all out on\r\nthe grounds.”\r\n\r\n“How they’ll stare!” cried Phil. “The ‘B. O. W. C.’ will become more\r\nfamous than ever,” said Tom Crawford.\r\n\r\n“Come, then,” said Arthur, “let us go down now.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart. “That would spoil all.”\r\n\r\n“Why, don’t you want the ‘B. O. W. C.’ to show themselves?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, but not now. I’ll tell you what to do. Let’s wait till\r\nto-morrow, and then we’ll get Jiggins’s cart, and make Solomon drive,\r\ndressed as Venerable Warden, up to the woods. We’ll follow as brigands.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! That’s splendid!” said Bruce Rawdon.\r\n\r\n“And I’ll show you something else,” said Bart, taking up the parcel\r\nwhich he had under his arm in the Rawdons’ room. “I’ve got something\r\nelse.” And he proceeded to open the parcel, while the others looked\r\non with eager expectation. He opened it, and drew out a folded cloth.\r\nUnfolding this, he shook it out, and spread it on the table. It was\r\na black flag., Upon this was stitched something round, which close\r\nexamination showed to be a desperate effort to represent a skull. To\r\nthe ordinary observer, however, it looked exactly like an elderly\r\ngentleman’s face, quite bald, and with a benevolent grin. Beneath\r\nit were the mysterious initials “B. O. W. C.” At sight of this, the\r\nlong-repressed feelings of the boys burst forth without restraint. With\r\nwild shouts they waved their hats in the air, and at last gave three\r\ncheers for Bart. It was long before their wild excitement could be\r\nquelled. Until late that night they sat in their wonderful dresses,\r\nadmiring their wonderful flag, and waiting, with eager impatience, for\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nBut who or what was the “B. O. W. C.”? That I must now proceed to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nThe “B. O. W. C.” arose from the genius of Bart Darner, who, in some\r\nrespects, was the most remarkable boy at Grand Pré School. His career\r\nthere had been a highly eventful one. His father was a merchant of the\r\ntown of St. John, and Bart had gathered, from the atmosphere of his\r\nnative place, a passionate desire to go to sea. With the idea of curing\r\nhim of this fancy, his father had taken him to Grand Pré School.\r\nBart had gone very good naturedly, and had been formally entered as a\r\nscholar. The first acquaintances which Bart made were the Rawdon boys;\r\nand on the very first evening after his arrival he confided to them his\r\ndetermination to quit the school immediately. This determination Bart\r\nwas not very long in putting into execution. Two days after his father\r\nhad left, Bart was among the missing. Inquiries were made everywhere,\r\nbut in vain. At length the worthy head master, Dr. Porter, conjectured\r\nthat he might have gone home; so he sent in the direction in which\r\nhe supposed it most likely that the fugitive would go. The conjecture\r\nproved to be well founded. Bart was found, on the following day, at an\r\ninn about forty miles away. He made no objection to returning, confessed\r\nthat he was on his way home, and made light of the whole affair.\r\nDr. Porter extorted from him a promise that he would make no further\r\nattempts to go home, and Bart began his school life.\r\n\r\nHis restless disposition soon caused a new interruption. At the end of\r\nthree weeks it was found that Bart was again missing. Dr. Porter was\r\ndeeply hurt, for he feared that Bart had broken his word. Search was\r\nmade everywhere, but in vain. A week passed away, but no discovery\r\nhad been made. At the end of that time, Old Solomon, the cook of the\r\nboarding school, affected perhaps by Dr. Porter’s deep anxiety, came\r\nto him and disclosed the hiding-place of the fugitive. It appeared that\r\nBart had struck up an eternal friendship with Solomon, and had gained\r\nhis assistance in a new scheme of flight. This time he did not seek to\r\ngo home, for he had promised Dr. Porter not to do so. His plan was to\r\nescape to the woods, and build a hut, while Solomon was to bring him\r\nprovision and news from the outer world. The Rawdons had been taken\r\ninto the secret, and Bart had been enjoying the life of a hermit, and\r\nthoughtlessly amusing himself with baffling the search that was going\r\non for him. Dr. Porter at once made Solomon accompany him to the\r\nhiding-place; and finding Bart there, he sent Solomon back, and had a\r\nlong conversation with the youthful hermit. What he said or did no one\r\nelse knew; but his mode of treatment was so effectual, that Bart from\r\nthat time forward gave up his wandering ways. A long composition was\r\nallotted him as a punishment, and Bart bore the penalty of his misdeeds\r\nlike a man.\r\n\r\nAfter this he diverted his active powers into a more legitimate\r\nchannel, and rapidly became one of the best scholars in his class. His\r\nrestlessness of temper and liveliness of disposition showed themselves\r\nin the invention of new games and sports for the amusement of his\r\ncompanions. He became a curious compound of intense earnestness and wild\r\nlevity. In school no one was so utterly absorbed in study as he; and\r\noutside, on the play-ground, no one abandoned himself so completely to\r\nfun and merriment. He took prizes and threw balls with equal facility.\r\nHe invented new modes of making balls, of shaping bats, and of fastening\r\nskates. He introduced new variations in the venerable game of marbles.\r\nHe made beautiful little schooners. He even constructed a steamboat out\r\nof an old clock. He organized a military company, including all the boys\r\nin the school, with lath guns and wooden swords, and a band which played\r\njew’s-harps and tin pails.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest of all his achievements was the organization of the “B.\r\nO. W. C.”\r\n\r\nIt arose-on this wise.\r\n\r\nFrom the very outset he had formed a close connection with four other\r\nboys, and the attachment to one another grew stronger among them every\r\nday. After organizing his militia company, and adding to it its famous\r\n“Tin Band,” Bart looked around him for more worlds to conquer; in other\r\nwords, for new ideas to put into practice. In a moment of inspiration he\r\nconceived the plan of a secret society, which was to include himself\r\nand his friends. No sooner was this suggested to the others, than they\r\nseized upon it with the greatest eagerness. The name was the first\r\nthing. At first they thought of calling it the “Pentagon.” Then they\r\nthought of the “Quintette.” Other names suggested themselves; but\r\nfinally they decided upon the “B. O. W. C.” The use of letters gave\r\na charming mystery. No one but a member of the society could ever\r\npenetrate the tremendous secret. But the time has at length come for\r\ndivulging it. It shall be a secret no longer. Those mysterious letters,\r\nthen, were intended to represent “_The Brethren of the Order of the\r\nWhite Cross_.”\r\n\r\nAs to the rest, the most charming ingenuity was shown in arranging the\r\ndetails. The officers had names of solemn import. They were,--\r\n\r\n1. The Most Venerable Patriarch.\r\n\r\n2. The Venerable Scribe.\r\n\r\n3. The Right Worshipful Commander.\r\n\r\n4. The Grand Scholastic.\r\n\r\n5. The Venerable Warden.\r\n\r\nAfterward another dignity was added.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that each office should be held only for one month. This\r\nwas calculated to satisfy the aspirations of all, since in this way each\r\nmember had a chance of filling every office in due time.\r\n\r\nThe initiation ceremonies were tremendous; the only trouble about these\r\nbeing that they never had any persons on whom to exercise them. They\r\nremained, therefore, like so many beautiful dreams. The costumes have\r\nalready been described. The most important thing among their furniture\r\nwas the phrenological bust. This was the pride and delight of the “B. O.\r\nW. C.” It had been obtained from a young man who was studying medicine\r\nin the village, and who levied a heavy tax upon the purses of the\r\nsociety for so precious an article. They had the bust, however, and did\r\nnot complain.\r\n\r\nI have said that another dignity was added to the original five. This\r\nwas in the person of the venerable Solomon. In consideration of his age,\r\nhis color, his occupation as cook, and his eminent previous services to\r\nall of them individually, it was unanimously resolved that he should be\r\nadmitted to the society. With very great delicacy they excused him the\r\nterrific initiation ceremony. Perhaps the idea that he might object\r\nto some of the details influenced them in this. Be this as it may, Old\r\nSolomon became a member, and a new dignity was created especially for\r\nhim. In a full meeting of the society, it was unanimously voted that he\r\nbe created _Perpetual Grand Panjandrum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_Grand Pré and Minas Basin.--An astonishing Procession.--Encampment of\r\nBrigands.--Break-up of Encampment and Flight of the Inmates._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Grand Pré Academy, under the presiding care of Dr. Porter, was a\r\nhighly popular and very efficient boarding school. In choosing such a\r\nplace for the Academy, Dr. Porter had shown that ardent love of nature\r\nwhich always distinguished him. It was situated in a place which yields\r\nto no other in the world for varied charms of land, sea, and sky, and\r\nwhich can never be forgotten after it has once been seen. Standing\r\nupon the slope of a hill, the Academy, with its broad portico and lofty\r\ncupola, looked down upon a scene whose loveliness has been described in\r\nLongfellow’s exquisite verse:\r\n\r\n               “In the Acadian land, on the shores of the Basin of Minas,\r\n\r\n                   Distant secluded still, the little village of Grand Pré\r\n\r\n               Lay in the fruitful valley. Vast meadows stretched to the\r\n\r\n                        eastward,\r\n\r\n               Giving the village its name, and pasture to flocks without\r\n\r\n                        number.\r\n\r\n               Dikes that the hands of the farmers had reared with labor\r\n\r\n                        incessant,\r\n\r\n               Shut out the turbulent tides; but at stated seasons the flood\r\n\r\n                        gates\r\n\r\n               Opened, and welcomed the sea to wander at will o’er the\r\n\r\n                        meadows.\r\n\r\n               “West and south there were fields of flax, and orchards and\r\n\r\n                        cornfields.\r\n\r\n               Spreading afar and unseened o’er the plain; and away to the\r\n\r\n                        northward.\r\n\r\n               Blomidon rose, and the forests old; and aloft on the moun\r\n\r\n                        tains\r\n\r\n               Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty\r\n\r\n                        Atlantic\r\n\r\n               Looked on the happy valley, but ne’er from their station de\r\n\r\n                        scended.”\r\n\r\nLooking from the portico of the Academy, the eye rested upon a broad\r\nexpanse of dike land immediately in front, which extended far away\r\nfor many miles on either hand. These the old Acadian farmers had first\r\nreclaimed from the sea, and afterward their successors had reared new\r\ndikes and reclaimed wider districts. The broad meadows immediately in\r\nfront were bounded by the Cornwallis River, a stream which at high tide\r\ncan float the largest ship, but which at low tide is so nearly empty\r\nthat but a slight rivulet runs through its channel. It runs into the\r\nBasin of Minas, where are the highest tides in the world.. Here the sea\r\ncarries in its salt waves up to where the dikes rise against them, and\r\nafterward retreating, they go back for miles, leaving vast tracts of mud\r\nflats exposed to the view. For many miles all around there are rivers\r\nthat run into this bay, all of which are subject to the same tides,\r\nand experience the same great vicissitudes, changing twice in the\r\ntwenty-four hours from shallow rivulets at the bottom of valleys of mud,\r\nto vast rivers which flow with swift and full streams. Twice on each day\r\nthe stream, which can scarce float a canoe, will grow to a mighty\r\nvolume of water, where navies might pass. Twice each day may be seen\r\nthe startling spectacle, once used as a formula for the impossible, of\r\nrivers running from the sea up their channels; and twice on each day the\r\nscene on Minas shores changes from a wide expanse of red mud to a vast\r\nsheet of deep-blue sea.\r\n\r\nAll that is wonderful and all that is sublime in nature may be found\r\nhere, side by side with all that is most sweet and beautiful. Behind the\r\nhill on whose slope the school stands lies the valley of the Gaspereaux,\r\nan Eden-like retreat, shut in by high hills and watered by a winding\r\nriver, sequestered from the world, full of that strange charm of repose\r\nthat may so seldom be met with in this busy age. Before the hill there\r\nspreads away for many a mile the broad vale of Cornwallis, through which\r\nthere flow five rivers, whoso waters are all chained up at their mouths,\r\nso that their beds may serve for verdurous dike lands to the farmers of\r\nthe valley. Far away on the other side extends a long range of hills,\r\nwhich push themselves forward into Minas Basin till they end in a\r\nprecipitous cliff, whose towering form is the centre of attraction for\r\nmany and many a mile. This is the famous Cape Blomidon, whose position\r\nis so peculiar, and whose shape is so striking, that it forms the\r\ncentral object to spectators all around the shores of the bay. Here is\r\na channel opening into the Bay of Fundy outside, and this channel is\r\nthe gate-way through which the disturbed and impetuous waters of the two\r\nseas forever rush backward and forward.\r\n\r\nIn that outer bay there are fierce tides, and swift currents, and\r\niron-bound shores, and lonely rocky isles; there are dense fogs, sharp\r\nsqualls, and sudden storms. The mists that prevail there are kept away\r\nby that lofty wall which terminates in Blomidon, and cannot penetrate\r\ninto the well-protected country within. The mists and the fogs seem like\r\nbaffled enemies, long beleaguering, but never victorious. From the sunny\r\nplains of Cornwallis and Grand Pré they may be seen crowded and piled\r\nup on the top of Blomidon, frowning darkly and menacingly upon the scene\r\nbeneath, as though eager to descend. But Old Blomidon guards well the\r\nland which he protects, and the mist and the fog that cross his crest\r\nare broken and dissipated into thin air.\r\n\r\nFrom all this there arise wondrous atmospheric effects. Here, when the\r\nfog is piled up in gloomy masses over Blomidon, and the sun is setting\r\nbehind them, may be seen a spectacle so gorgeous that, if it could be\r\nportrayed on canvas, few would believe it to be a copy of nature. It\r\nwould be deemed the fantastic vision of some artist mad from love of\r\ndeep gloom and vivid color; for the colors here at sunset are sometimes\r\nas numerous, as varied, and as vivid as those of a rainbow. The whole\r\nwest glows with indescribable glory, when out of black clouds and\r\nvoluminous folds of whirling fog-wreaths there beams a gorgeous red,\r\nforth from which shoot up innumerable rays far into the zenith, formed\r\nof every hue and shade, which shift and change like the rays of the\r\nAurora Borealis, and cast upon all the sky and upon all the earth\r\nsomething of their own splendid radiance.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning which followed the meeting of the “B. O. W. C.,”\r\n a singular scene was presented in front of the Academy. A crowd had\r\ngathered there surrounding a very remarkable group. There was a cart\r\ncontaining a number of baskets and some pots, in which was harnessed a\r\nquadruped which charity might consent to name a horse, but which looked\r\nmore like a skeleton of one of the extinct species. Seated high and dry\r\nin an old arm-chair was the venerable figure of Solomon in his robes of\r\noffice, that is to say, his office of Perpetual Grand Panjandrum. He had\r\nan old college cap and gown, and a master’s hood, while the spectacles\r\nthat bestrided his nose, and the altitude of his shirt collar, were of\r\nthemselves sufficient to strike awe into the beholder. Behind the cart\r\nwere the “B. O. W. C.,” robed in the red shirts and plumed hats which\r\nBart had found for them. Bart had a pistol in his belt. Each one had\r\nsomething, if it were nothing better than a case-knife. But the centre\r\nof all eyes was the flag. This Bart had generously handed over to Bruce\r\nRawdon, who was the Most Venerable Patriarch for the month of May. As\r\nthe wind caught it and unfolded it before the astonished eyes of the\r\nother boys, the skeleton head grinned benignantly at them from his airy\r\nhome, and a loud shout of admiration burst forth from all.\r\n\r\nSolomon cracked his whip. The procession started. The noise, the\r\nlaughter, and the joking were wonderful. Heads appeared at all the\r\nwindows of the house where the teachers lived. There were the laughing\r\nfaces of Dr. Porter and his family; there was the wondering gaze of Mr.\r\nSimmons, the mathematical teacher; and there, at another window, the\r\nlong, solemn physiognomy of Mr. Long, of the English department. Thus\r\nthe procession went on, followed by all the boys, and the centre of\r\nadmiring interest. It was a proud moment for the “B. O. W. C.”\r\n\r\nIn this fashion they went up the hill behind the Academy, and at length\r\nreached the woods. They passed several cavities in the ground which\r\nhad once been cellars of the old Acadian houses. They passed through an\r\norchard where the old, neglected apple trees still spoke of the Acadian\r\nfarmer who had planted them and cleared the forest around.\r\n\r\nThe road entered the woods, and they went along for some distance. At\r\nlast, in the midst of the woods they turned aside to the left, and after\r\na hundred yards or so they stopped, and the cart was unloaded.\r\n\r\nAt this place there was a steep descent on the right through the thick\r\nwoods. Down this the “B. O. W. C.” carried the articles which they had\r\nbrought. On reaching the bottom, they emerged into a space clear of\r\ntrees, where a brook ran babbling on. About twenty yards up, a dam had\r\nbeen built, and a pond of water formed, at one end of which was a large\r\ncamp made of spruce and fir. Shut in among the woods, with the little\r\npond in front of it, and the brook babbling behind it, it formed\r\nas secluded a place as could be desired. This spot was once the\r\nhiding-place of Bart during his second flight, and had ever since been\r\na favorite resort of his. There were many camps and pleasant arbors\r\nthrough the woods, but the newly-made pond had given to this place the\r\nundoubted preeminence. It had all been done very secretly within a week,\r\nand all the other boys now saw it for the first time, and gave utterance\r\nto their feelings in low murmurs of surprise and admiration. But the “B.\r\nO. W. C.” had much to attend to. First of all, they had to carry down\r\ntheir provisions. Then they had to arrange them, and finally they had\r\nthe most important duty of all to attend to, which was no less momentous\r\na thing than hoisting their flag. Soon the moment came. A pole had been\r\nalready prepared. The ropes were attached, the pole was nailed to a\r\ncorner post of the camp, and the flag was hauled up to its place with\r\nloud cheers, in which all the other boys joined with the greatest vigor.\r\n\r\nAfter this the “B. O. W. C.” flung themselves down and rested for a\r\ntime. The other boys inspected the place closely, and questioned the\r\nowners of the camp as to their intention.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to sleep here?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes.”\r\n\r\n“What’ll you sleep on?”\r\n\r\n“Brush, of course.”\r\n\r\n“And will you cook?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Have you a fireplace?”\r\n\r\n“No, but we’re going to make one to-day.”\r\n\r\n“What’ll you do if it rains?”\r\n\r\n“Grin and bear it.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! You don’t mean to say that you’d stay here if you got wet\r\nthrough.”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t we, though? You see.”\r\n\r\n“Dr. Porter wouldn’t let you.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, he would. He always says it don’t hurt boys to get wet.”\r\n\r\n“O, he means by day. He wouldn’t let you sleep here in a storm.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? The camp is good enough.”\r\n\r\n“Good enough? It can’t keep the rain off.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, it can.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t enough to eat here--have you?” asked others.\r\n\r\n“Plenty.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! It will all be gone before two days.”\r\n\r\n“Well, can’t we easily get things? I’ve got a pistol, and mean to shoot\r\nhares and things.”\r\n\r\nBart proudly displayed his pistol, and the sight of this formidable arm\r\nsilenced all controversy.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” said Bart, proudly, “we’ve got a gun.”\r\n\r\n“A gun!” repeated the others, in low tones. “Yes; we expect to be\r\nattacked.”\r\n\r\n“Attacked? Who’d attack you?”\r\n\r\n“O, the Gaspereaugians.”\r\n\r\n(“The Gaspereaugians” was a name given by the boys to the inhabitants of\r\nGaspereaux.)\r\n\r\n“Do you think they will?”\r\n\r\n“Of course; but if they try it, they’ll find us ready for them,”\r\n said Bart, fiercely. “We’ve hoisted our flag, and I’d like to see the\r\nGaspereaugian that would dare to pull it down.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if it comes to that, you’ve got us, you know. We’ll be on hand.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Bart, gravely. “I’ll tell you what we’re going to do:\r\nwe’ll send out scouts, and if we see any signs of an attack, we’ll let\r\nyou know. I’ve got a trumpet here, and when I blow three times, you’ll\r\nbe along to help. See.”\r\n\r\nAnd Bart stepped back to a bundle, out of which he pulled a long tin\r\nhorn, of the kind known among ‘longshoremen as “fog-horns.”\r\n\r\n“But we won’t blow it till we’re hard up, you know,” he continued.\r\n“We’ll only blow it if they come in a great crowd, you know.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes; of course.”\r\n\r\nThe boys now broke up into little knots, and proposed all sorts of\r\nplans. A mania for camping out set in strong among them all. The example\r\nof the “B. O. W. C.” in damming the stream was to be imitated at once.\r\nEach little knot of boys had places peculiar to themselves along the\r\nsame stream, some of which were the work of predecessors, and had\r\nsomething like a history. After a time most of the boys went back for\r\nspades, pickaxes, shovels, axes, and whatever else might be needed for\r\nthe great work of camp-building. The “B. O. W. C.” then turned their\r\nattention toward the completion, of their own camp. A fireplace\r\nhad still to be built, and brush cut for beds. To this they devoted\r\nthemselves very vigorously, and worked till about ten o’clock, when\r\ntheir labors were suddenly interrupted by the appearance of Dr. Porter\r\nand Mr. Simmons. They stood for some time looking with a smile at the\r\nbusy scene, before they were noticed. As soon as the boys recognized\r\ntheir visitors, they came up laughing, eager to describe the beauties\r\nof their camp. Dr. Porter was much amused, particularly with the flag,\r\nwhich floated from the mast.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said he at length, after he had asked about everything, “I have\r\ncome up to make you an offer.”\r\n\r\n“An offer? What is it, sir?” cried they all.\r\n\r\n“How would you like to give up, for the present, your bandit camp, take\r\naway all your provision, haul down your flag, and go away?”\r\n\r\n“What, sir!” cried the boys in consternation, and a cloud of gloom\r\npassed over their-faces.\r\n\r\n“How would you like me to charter a little schooner, fill it with\r\nprovisions, turn the hold into a sleeping-place, and start off for\r\na week’s cruise around the Basin of Minas, going ashore at the Five\r\nIslands, at Parrsboro’, at Blomidon, and at any other, place where we\r\nmight wish? What do you say to that? Ah, ha!” cried the doctor, as he\r\nwatched the changing faces of the boys, where the gloom had vanished\r\ninstantly, and given place to the wildest delight. “Ah, ha! that suits\r\nyou--does it! Well, that’s what I’ve come to propose.”\r\n\r\n“O, Dr. Porter! Are you really in earnest? Do you mean it?--a\r\nschooner--a schooner?--a cruise round Minas Basin? O, good! good! good!\r\nHurrah! Three cheers!”\r\n\r\nA hundred incoherent shouts and words like these burst from the boys as\r\nthey dashed about in wild and frantic delight, overwhelmed with joy at\r\nthis proposal to all of them. It seemed a thing so glorious that nothing\r\nof which the mind could conceive was to be compared with it. A cruise\r\nround Minas Basin! What did not that involve? Adventures of a hundred\r\nkinds; drifting about in wild tides; getting lost in dense fogs; running\r\nashore on wide mud flats, or on precipitous cliffs, or on the edge of\r\nperilous breakers; landing on lonely headlands, or on solitary islands;\r\npenetrating far forests; camping out in wildernesses; living pirate\r\nfashion in their own schooner, where all would be given up to them;\r\nshooting, fishing; hunting for gulls’ nests;--it meant not sham\r\nadventures, but real ones--with real dangers environing them instead of\r\nfancied ones. They could cease playing at Robbers, and play what to them\r\nseemed the nobler part of Pirates; the skull-and-cross-bones flag could\r\nadorn the schooner, and the fog-trumpet could sound forth amid the\r\nechoing cliffs of Blomidon. It meant anything and everything, and far\r\nmore than even their vivid fancies could very well portray. To most boys\r\nthe sea always promises more adventure than the land; there is always\r\nsomething of the joy of discovery in every new voyage, and so all\r\nthese boys felt now; but to Bart, most of all, was the prospect most\r\ndelightful; for he had already known to the full that longing for the\r\nsea which many boys have, and that which his father had prevented him\r\nfrom realizing, now seemed to come to him. In some respects this seemed\r\nto be better than the voyage which he had formerly dreamed of; for\r\nthough it would not be long, yet it would be varied and eventful, and\r\nnot free from danger. Best of all, it would be made in company with the\r\nother boys.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the boys were able, in their excitement, to\r\nget any clear idea of what Dr. Porter was telling them. At length they\r\nlearned that Mr. Simmons and Mr. Long wished to visit Blomidon and the\r\nFive Islands in search after minerals, with which the cliffs are filled.\r\nThey had concluded to get a schooner, and take the larger boys\r\nwith them. They expected to spend about a week, and take provisions\r\nsufficient for that time. Dr. Porter would not be able to go himself,\r\nbut would intrust the boys to the care and the jurisdiction of Messrs.\r\nSimmons and Long. Such was the plan.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the schooner was already engaged. It was the Antelope, Captain\r\nCorbet; and it was proposed to leave, if possible, that very afternoon,\r\nso as to be on the other side of the bay, or at least near Blomidon,\r\nby sundown. As it was then ten o’clock, there was no time to lose, but\r\neverything should be prepared at once, and taken on board the schooner.\r\nOne thing only was insisted on by Dr. Porter; and that was, that they\r\nshould take no firearms. Bart pleaded so hard for his little pistol,\r\nhowever, that the doctor let him keep it, and satisfied himself by\r\nmaking them leave the gun behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_Another extraordinary Procession.--An eccentric Crew.--A\r\nflighty Shipper.--Wonderful Attachment of Captain, Corbet to his\r\nOffspring.--Stealing a Stone Fence, and raising the Black Flag._\r\n\r\n\r\nSOON the woods were deserted. Twelve or fifteen boys were selected as\r\nworthy of the adventurous voyage, and these all made their preparations,\r\nwhile the smaller boys looked on with longing eyes. As for the “B. O.\r\nW. C.,” they had no preparations to make. They needed only to transfer\r\ntheir provisions and other things from the camp to the schooner.\r\nThe teachers were to see about the bedding, &c. These boys therefore\r\nenlisted Old Solomon in their service, and packed their things once\r\nmore in the same cart which had taken them to the camp; after which they\r\nwaited to accompany the others to the schooner. All possible haste was\r\nmade; and soon there started for the schooner a procession even more\r\nextraordinary than the one which had gone into the woods.\r\n\r\nFirst of all went a huge hay-cart crammed with bedding; then followed a\r\nwagon filled with provisions; and after this the cart of the “B. O. W.\r\nC.,” driven by Solomon. Then followed the voyageurs in procession; and\r\nafter these came the small boys, green with envy. Messrs. Simmons and\r\nLong walked modestly on the sidewalk, not caring to identify themselves\r\nwith so odd a crowd.\r\n\r\nIn fact it was an odd crowd. First there was Solomon in full canonicals,\r\nthen the “B. O. W. C.” in their red shirts and plumed caps, with axes\r\nand knives in their belts; and then followed their companions in the\r\nvoyage, dressed more grotesquely still. All the old clothes that could\r\nbe found were pressed into service for this occasion. Old pea-jackets,\r\nold “sou’-wester” hats, old coats denuded of skirts, jackets in a state\r\nof dilapidation, battered caps, shocking bad hats, which had not been on\r\na human head for ever so long,--all were now brought into requisition,\r\nand formed an assemblage which was sufficient to drive an “Old Clo’” man\r\nwild with covetousness.\r\n\r\nNow, as Homer, at the outset of his poem, enumerates the ships and\r\nchieftains, so will I complete the enumeration of the voyageurs in this\r\nadventurous expedition.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, there came a little Irishman, who had accidentally dropped\r\ninto the Academy, and had remained. His name was Michael Murphy, and\r\nconsequently he was always called Pat, except when the boys called him\r\nPatsie,--for short, as they said. He wore an old sky-blue dress-coat,\r\nwith three brass buttons still remaining, fastened around the waist with\r\na red woollen comforter. A battered silk hat, with the top of the crown\r\noff, completed his costume.\r\n\r\nWith him came Peter Fraser, commonly known as Johnnie Blue, a thick-set,\r\nbullet-headed boy, full of obstinate, persevering courage, and dressed\r\nin a sailor’s pea-jacket, made to fit himself by the simple plan of\r\ncutting off the sleeves. He wore a sou’wester, and carried a sailor’s\r\nknife. In fact, his get-up was very remarkably nautical.\r\n\r\nThen came David Digg, a tall, solemn, pale boy, very studious, with\r\na taste for geology. He wore an old overcoat minus the tails, and a\r\nknitted yarn night-cap. David Digg was always called Bogud by the boys,\r\nfrom the fact that in one of the rules of the Latin Grammar they had\r\nlearned that “David and Bogud are common.”\r\n\r\nThen came George McLeod, whose name was facetiously contracted into\r\nMuckle. By some extraordinary means he had obtained possession of a\r\nsoldier’s red coat, and produced an immense sensation.\r\n\r\nThen came Jacob Wiggins, whose name was easily contracted into Jiggins,\r\nby which name alone he was known. He wore a red bandana handkerchief\r\naround his head, and was arrayed in a big gray homespun coat, which he\r\nhad borrowed from a friendly farmer.\r\n\r\nAfter these marched William MacNamara, known as Billymack, wearing a\r\ntail coat, long top boots, and a felt hat.\r\n\r\nAnd last, there was George Henderson, who had gained the singular name\r\nof Sammy Bam Ram, which occurs in one of Dr. Bird’s novels, from some\r\namusing incident in his school life. A very old jacket, a very ragged\r\npair of trousers, and a hat on the extreme verge of decrepitude, formed\r\nhis attire.\r\n\r\nThe chief harbor of Grand Pré now goes by the name of Mud Creek, and is\r\none of the many examples which go to prove that the Anglo-Saxon, though\r\nsuperior to the Frenchman in colonizing a new country, is very far his\r\ninferior in giving names to the places which he may have colonized. At\r\nthis place the party soon arrived, and looked for the vessel. To their\r\nsurprise, they found her quite deserted, lying aground at a wharf. On\r\ngoing aboard, they found that no preparations whatever had been made.\r\n\r\n“This is too bad!” cried Mr. Long, in tones of deep vexation. “Corbet\r\npromised to be here early, and have everything ready. I wonder what can\r\nhave become of him.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he started off to try and find Captain Corbet. After about\r\nhalf an hour he returned.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what it is,” he said; “we can’t afford to wait. We _must_\r\nbegin right away and make our arrangements.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no ballast on board,” said Mr. Simmons, who had been carefully\r\ninspecting the vessel, “and no floor in the hold.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Mr. Long; and hurrying on board, he soon saw that such was\r\nindeed the case. He then stood for a time vexed and perplexed.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said he at length, “we must all get to work, so that we\r\nmay be ready when Corbet does come. There’s a pile of stones over there\r\nwhich will do very well for ballast;” and he pointed to a stone wall\r\nwhich surrounded a garden close by the wharf. “Now come, boys,” he\r\ncontinued, “form a line from the stones to the schooner, and pass them\r\nall along from hand to hand.”\r\n\r\n“But it’s Mr. Brown’s fence,” objected Mr. Simmons, who did not relish\r\nthis infringement on the rights of another.\r\n\r\n“O, Mr. Brown won’t mind!” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“He knows me. Come, boys;” and Mr. Long, who was always rapid and\r\nenergetic, soon formed the boys in line, and the stones were speedily\r\ntransferred from hand to hand.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Simmons,” said Mr. Long, after a time, “I think I’ll go and get\r\nsome boards.” And saying this, he hurried away, leaving the others hard\r\nat work, and expecting the absent Corbet. The boys worked with a will;\r\nand even the smaller ones, who were to have no part in the voyage,\r\nformed another line, and passed on the smaller stones. At the end of\r\ntwo hours the vessel was considered by Mr. Simmons to have sufficient\r\nballast, the garden wall had vanished, and the boys stood waiting, with\r\nblistered hands, for Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\nWhile they were waiting, Mr. Long once more appeared.\r\n\r\n“What! hasn’t Corbet come yet?” he cried.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nMr. Long looked around in despair.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had to go three miles for the boards,” said he. “They’ll be here\r\nin a few minutes. Everything is against us to-day. We’ve got to work\r\nhard yet, or we won’t get off. Mr. Simmons, would you be kind enough to\r\ngo and see if you can find Corbet in the village? and I’ll go down into\r\nthe hold to lay the flooring.”\r\n\r\nOff went Mr. Simmons, and down went Mr. Long into the hold. The wagon\r\nsoon arrived with the boards, which were passed down to him, and\r\nspeedily laid over the ballast. Thanks to his skill and energy, the\r\nfloor was soon made. Then the boys set to work throwing down the\r\nbedding, and arranging the trunks and baskets. There was not much time,\r\nhowever, for any arrangements. The things lay in a confused heap, with a\r\nbusy crowd laboring to reduce them to order.\r\n\r\nAt the end of about half an hour Mr. Simmons returned, shaking his head.\r\nHe had not found Captain Corbet. Things began to look desperate. It was\r\nnow high tide, and high time for leaving. Time and tide, which wait for\r\nno man, were not going to wait for Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\nThere was the Antelope all ready. She was not much of a vessel, it is\r\ntrue. She resembled a wash-tub in many important points. She looked\r\nleaky. She smelled strong of potatoes; and rightly so, for that\r\nimportant vegetable formed her invariable cargo. The name Antelope was a\r\ndelightful jest. Her chains were deeply eaten with rust; her cordage\r\nand rigging had a time-worn appearance. A venerable air of decay rested\r\nabout her. Yet still, in spite of all, there she was, and a dozen eager\r\nyoung hearts were burning to embark in her, and be away before the tide\r\nshould fall.\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Long started off, in company with Mr. Simmons, to hunt up\r\nCaptain Corbet, or some other man who might go in his place. The boys\r\nstood about the wharf waiting impatiently for their return.\r\n\r\nMr. Long and his companion hurried to the village inn, and found out\r\nthat Captain Corbet lived three miles away. So they borrowed a horse and\r\nwagon, and drove off as fast as possible to the house. Arriving there,\r\nthey entered, and beheld a scene which so overpowered Mr. Long that for\r\na time he could not speak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0050]\r\n\r\nFor there in his kitchen, in a high-backed chair, in front of his own\r\nhearth-stone,--there sat the identical Captain Corbet for whom so many\r\nhad been waiting so long. He held an infant in his manly arms, he was\r\ngently tilting his chair to and fro, and tenderly feeding his prattling\r\ninnocent with a spoon. So intent was he upon his tender task, that he\r\ndid not hear the entrance of his excited pursuers.\r\n\r\n“Captain Corbet!”\r\n\r\nThe tone in which Mr. Long spoke cannot possibly be represented in\r\nprint; or at any rate to do so would require more notes of admiration\r\nthan are usually found in any common printing office. The tone will\r\nhave to be imagined. Suffice it to say, that Captain Corbet dropped the\r\nspoon,--almost dropped the baby also,--and started to his feet as though\r\nhe had been stirred up by a galvanic shock administered full on the\r\nganglionic centres.\r\n\r\n“Captain Corbet!” cried Mr. Long, furiously. “Didn’t you say you’d be on\r\nthe wharf in good time, and that the Antelope would leave at this tide?”\r\n\r\n“Why! it’s Mr. Long!” said Captain Corbet. “Why, Mr. Long! Glad to see\r\nyou. Sit down. Why, you railly frightened me. Why, I’m railly pleased to\r\nsee you. I am, railly.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean,” cried Mr. Long, in a great passion, “by this\r\nmockery? Here have we been waiting for you ever since morning, and we’ve\r\nhad to put the ballast on board with our own hands; and I come here and\r\nfind you quite indifferent. What do you mean, sir? Are you going, or\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Good gracious!” said Captain Corbet. “The ballast! Why, railly now! Did\r\nyou go and put it on board? Why, I do declare!”\r\n\r\nMr. Long gave a dark frown, and with a violent effort smothered his\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n“Are you coming, or not?” said he, sternly.\r\n\r\n“Coming? Why--not jest now. You see there’s the babby.”\r\n\r\nAnd he put his brown finger under the chin of his offspring, and\r\nactually forgot himself so far as to whistle to it; after which he cast\r\na furtive glance at his visitors, as though half expecting that they\r\nwould admire the child.\r\n\r\n“Where’s Mrs. Corbet? It’s _her_ place to mind the child--your place is\r\non board the vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I can’t put the babby on the floor, as I see; nor I can’t take him\r\non board.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s Mrs. Corbet?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you see, she started off airly to hunt up some parygolic. The\r\nbabby’s troubled with wind, and--”\r\n\r\n“When will she be back?” interrupted Mr. Long.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head solemnly.\r\n\r\n“It would take a man with a head as long as a horse to tell that,” said\r\nhe, sententiously.\r\n\r\n“Where is she then? I’ll drive off and get her.”\r\n\r\n“She! law bless you, I don’t know no more’n a onhatched chick.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t know! You surely know which way she went.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, she kind o’ tho’t she’d go to the village, and then she kind o’\r\nhinted she’d visit her married sister that lives on Billy Jackson’s\r\nfarm. They’re down with the measles, and--”\r\n\r\n“Bother the measles! Do you mean to say that you let her go off, and\r\nquietly sat down here to nurse your baby, when you ought to have been at\r\nwork?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t let her go. She walked off herself. ‘Benjamin,’ says she,\r\n‘take care of the babby.’ He’s dreadful fond of me. Won’t be fed by\r\nnobody else. I ginrally feed him at nights when he wakes. An’ a dreadful\r\nhigh-sperited creetur is that child’s mother. An’ they shan’t abuse\r\nhim. No-o-o-o,” he added, abruptly, turning his conversation toward the\r\n“babby” himself, who began to make faces and utter sounds premonitory of\r\na howl.\r\n\r\nMr. Long turned abruptly away.\r\n\r\n“The man’s an idiot!” said he to Mr. Simmons. “We’ll have to get some\r\none else to go with us.”\r\n\r\n“See here,” said he, turning to Captain Corbet, who was stirring up some\r\npap to feed his “babby;”\r\n\r\n“I’ve engaged your schooner, and I mean to start in her. All our\r\nthings are on board, and we can’t lose a whole day. You’ve broken your\r\nengagement; so I’ll go without you. I’ll find somebody that can sail\r\nher. I’ll go to Captain Pearson, or old McNeil, or somebody.”\r\n\r\n“There ain’t a skipper in the place. You won’t find anybody. I’m the\r\non’y schooner here. Everybody is got off to Bosting with taters. I’d\r\nbeen off, too, on’y for the babby.”\r\n\r\n“Well, when can you go?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n“O, it’ll be all right. I’ll be along--some time. I dare say Mrs. Corbet\r\n’ll be home soon. Don’t be alarmed about me. I’ll put you through.”\r\n\r\n“See here, Captain Corbet; I’ll go off now and find somebody to take me.\r\nYou’ve deceived me, and disappointed me.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Mr. Long strode out of the house, followed by his\r\ncompanion, and drove away rapidly in search of some one to navigate the\r\nschooner.\r\n\r\nAll his efforts were vain. It was as Captain Corbet said. There wasn’t\r\nany one in the place. Every seafaring man had gone off in some kind of\r\npotato craft to Boston, allured by the high prices of potatoes. Fortunes\r\nwere being made, and nothing but the desperate imbecility of Corbet\r\nprevented him from having his share in the golden harvest. Time passed.\r\nThe tide fell rapidly, and the vessel was again left aground by the\r\nretreating waters. It would be necessary to postpone their departure\r\nuntil the following day, for they did not care about starting in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it. They would have to wait. Mr. Long went up\r\nagain to see Captain Corbet, and extorted from him a promise to leave\r\nat nine o’clock on the following morning. Before he left he had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing Mrs. Corbet arrive home, and got her to promise\r\nthat her husband should go. As this was the only thing that could be\r\ndone, he went back to make known the state of the case to the boys.\r\n\r\nAs to the boys, though disappointed, they were not at all cast down.\r\nThey had possession of the vessel, with beds and provisions, and on the\r\nvessel they were bound to remain. Mr. Long found that they had eaten\r\nan excellent dinner, and were preparing their evening repast in the\r\nschooner’s hold, which they now considered their home. They did not want\r\nto go to the Academy to eat or to sleep. They were navigators, and their\r\nlife was on the ocean wave, their home on the rolling deep.\r\n\r\nSo they passed the night on board, and found the first experience of\r\nwild life very pleasant. Songs and laughter arose until late, and it was\r\nmidnight before the merry voices ceased to rise into the still air.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Mr. Long was down, and found that the boys had\r\nalready finished breakfast, and were eagerly awaiting the next turn in\r\nthe proceedings of the day. He communicated to them his anxieties about\r\nCorbet, and gave them to understand that they might not get off at all,\r\nunless they could secure the dawdling skipper. He urged them all to\r\naccompany him to Corbet’s house, so as to bring a moral power to bear\r\nwhich he would not be able to withstand.\r\n\r\nThis proposal the boys received with three stunning cheers.\r\n\r\nOff, then, started all the boys, headed by Mr. Long, who, in his\r\nexcitement, no longer cared about the ragged regiment at his heels. For\r\nthree good miles they footed it bravely, and at length stood in front of\r\nCaptain Corbet’s door. Mr. Long entered, and found the navigator seated\r\nin his kitchen by the fireplace, dandling the babby. The wife of his\r\nbosom was setting the breakfast table.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” said Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s Mr. Long! Railly now,” said Captain Corbet. “An’ it shall see\r\nMr. Long, too,--so it shall,” he continued, holding up the babby, who\r\nfastened its large blue eyes upon the visitor.\r\n\r\nMr. Long turned away, and spoke aside with Mrs. Corbet. Rightly\r\nconsidering that she was the true head of the house, he begged her\r\nnot to let them be disappointed again. He was successful. Mrs. Corbet\r\nassured him that the moment breakfast was over she would send him off.\r\n\r\n“And we will wait,” said Mr. Long.\r\n\r\nSo they waited patiently; and at last Captain Corbet tore himself away\r\nfrom his house, his wife, and his babby, and went to the schooner,\r\naccompanied by the ragged regiment of boys.\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o’clock, and the schooner was afloat. All tumbled on\r\nboard. The hawswrs were unloosed. Captain Corbet had to go ashore to\r\nget a man whom he called his “mate;” but as Mr. Long went with him but\r\nlittle time was lost.\r\n\r\nAt last the sails were hoisted. The wind filled them, and the Antelope\r\nmoved slowly from the wharf. A loud, ringing cheer arose as the schooner\r\nstarted. Before the last notes died away, however, a man was seen\r\nrunning down toward the wharf. He was short and fat, and panted heavily.\r\nReaching the wharf, he cast one look of consternation at the place where\r\nthe garden wall had been, and another at the schooner.\r\n\r\n“They’ve done it, by jingo!” he exclaimed. “Hallo there!” he screamed.\r\n“Did you go and take my fence for ballast, Corbet?”\r\n\r\n“No, I didn’t!” yelled Corbet.\r\n\r\n“You did, you scoundrel! Harris saw those young reprobates passing the\r\nstones on board. Bring them back at once, every one of them, or I’ll\r\nmake you sup sorrow!”\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Long stepped forward.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” said he. “It’s no matter--”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried the owner of the fence. “I say it is _not_ all right; and\r\nit _is_ matter. Bring me back my fence!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll bring it back.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll have the law of you!”\r\n\r\n“All right. We’ll replace it.”\r\n\r\n“Bring it back!”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\n“Bring--back--my--fence--!”\r\n\r\nFurther and further away the schooner moved, and fainter and fainter\r\ngrew the voice that called after them, till at last but a low and\r\nscarcely audible tone could be heard.\r\n\r\nAs the vessel moved away, Bart stood at the mainmast. He had worked hard\r\nthe day before, running some lanyards through the truck, and now the\r\nmoment had come for his reward. Bruce Rawdon fired his pistol, and as\r\nthe report died away, up to the mast head went the black flag of the “B.\r\nO. W. C.”\r\n\r\nAnd all the boys greeted it with a cheer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n_Blomidon.--Tides and Fogs.--Songs and Seasickness.--The Five Islands,\r\nand a Race up a Précipice._\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDING on through the tortuous channel of the creek, they reached its\r\nmouth without accident, and passed out into the bay. The morning was\r\nbright and beautiful, the wind blew fair, and all gave themselves up to\r\nthe joy of the occasion. The Antelope, it is true, was of ancient build\r\nand model; she was short, and broad, and round, but the wind was of such\r\na kind as to bring out whatever capacity for sailing she might have. The\r\nsun shone brightly, and all around them sparkled the blue waves of the\r\nbay. Behind them was the long level of Grand Pré, beyond which the hills\r\narose, whose slopes were dotted with white houses. Before them was the\r\nwide bay bounded by the Parrsboro’ shore, while conspicuous, as usual,\r\narose the grand form of Blomidon.\r\n\r\n“Is Blomidon a French name?” asked Bart of Mr. Simmons.\r\n\r\n“No. It is said to be a corruption of the words _Blow me down_, and it\r\nis spelled that way on old maps. A good many old coasting skippers\r\npronounce it in that way. The winds that prevail out there off the cape\r\nare a sufficient cause for such a name.”\r\n\r\n“Are there more winds off Blomidon than in other parts of the bay?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes. It is seldom calm there. It seems as if all the winds of the\r\nBay of Fundy and of the Basin of Minas struggled together there. It is a\r\nsort of funnel through which they all pour backward or forward. Then the\r\nsea out there is often quite heavy. The meeting of different currents\r\nand different winds causes this. Seldom will you find a place where such\r\nfierce currents rush to and fro.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we land at Blomidon first?”\r\n\r\n“I do not think we can with this wind. It will be better, I think, to\r\nwait till we come back. We will go across the Basin to the Five Islands\r\nfirst.”\r\n\r\n“Where are the highest tides of this Basin?”\r\n\r\n“Do you see away there,” said Mr. Simmons, pointing far away toward the\r\nright, “where the land seems to sink down?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there the water runs up till it ends in the Shubenacadie River.\r\nIt is there that the tide runs highest, and I suppose there is no part\r\nof the world where the rise is so great.”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe it rises ninety feet?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard so,--at spring tides,--but I rather think it is an\r\nexaggeration. It is difficult to get a fair and accurate measurement. I\r\ndo not think that it rises much over seventy feet.”\r\n\r\n“That is high enough to surpass all other tides, I should think. But\r\nsee--hallo! what’s that?”\r\n\r\n“And Bart darted to the side of the vessel, attracted by a shout. A\r\nlarge schooner was approaching, on board of which all were staring with\r\ngrinning faces at the Antelope.\r\n\r\n“Is that Captain Kidd’s craft?” shouted one of the sailors.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” screamed Bart.\r\n\r\n“We’re going to dig up a little buried treasure.”\r\n\r\nA yell of derision and laughter was the answer, to which the boys of the\r\nAntelope responded by wild, unearthly shouts; and so the vessels passed\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nIn commemoration of this little incident, one of the boys commenced to\r\nsing a doleful ditty, known in literature as “The Dying Confession of\r\nCaptain Kidd,” of which the following lines will give a good idea:\r\n\r\n                   “O, my name is Captain Kidd,\r\n\r\n                        As I sailed, as I sailed;\r\n\r\n                   O, my name is Captain Kidd,\r\n\r\n                        As I sailed.\r\n\r\n                   O, my name is Captain Kidd,\r\n\r\n                   And much wiekedness I did,\r\n\r\n                   And a heap of gold I hid,\r\n\r\n                        As I sailed.”\r\n\r\nOne song started another, and one by one their favorite school songs\r\ncame out. One of these was the following:\r\n\r\n                        1st Verse. (Brisk.)\r\n\r\n                        “Three blue-bottles,\r\n\r\n                        Three blue-bottles,\r\n\r\n                        Three blue-bottles sat\r\n\r\n                        On a milestone.”\r\n\r\n                        Recitative.\r\n\r\n                        “One flew away.”\r\n\r\n                        2d Verse. (Slow.)\r\n\r\n                        “Two blue-bottles,\r\n\r\n                        Two blue-bottles,\r\n\r\n                        Two blue-bottles sat\r\n\r\n                        On a milestone.”\r\n\r\n                        Recitative.\r\n\r\n                        “Another flew away.”\r\n\r\n                        3d Verse. (Slower.)\r\n\r\n                        “One blue-bottle,\r\n\r\n                        One blue-bottle,\r\n\r\n                        One blue-bottle sat\r\n\r\n                        On a milestone.”\r\n\r\n                        Recitative.\r\n\r\n                        “That one flew away.”\r\n\r\n               4th Verse. (Very slow, very sad, and very solemn.)\r\n\r\n                        “No blue-bottles,\r\n\r\n                        No blue-bottles,\r\n\r\n                        No blue-bottles sat\r\n\r\n                        On a milestone.”\r\n\r\n                        Recitative.\r\n\r\n                        “One came back.”\r\n\r\n                        5th Verse. (Less sad.)\r\n\r\n                        “One blue-bottle,\r\n\r\n                        One blue-bottle,\r\n\r\n                        One blue-bottle sat\r\n\r\n                        On a milestone.”\r\n\r\nGradually the blue-bottles of the song come back, till finally, on the\r\nreturn of the three, the song comes to a triumphant conclusion.\r\n\r\nStanding at the helm, Captain Corbet gave directions from time to time\r\nto the “mate” about sailing the vessel, and listened to the songs of\r\nthe boys with a patriarchal smile. He had already shown himself so\r\naccessible, that all the boys had chatted with him; and at last they\r\ninsisted that he should sing. Captain Corbet did not need very much\r\nsolicitation; Standing at the helm with his eyes half closed, he began\r\nin a thin, shrill, piping, nasal voice, full of queer tremolos and grace\r\nnotes, to drone out several melodies of a varied character. The first\r\none was an ancient ballad, called “The Farmier’s Boy,” which began as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n               “O, the sky was black, the day was cold,\r\n\r\n                   And the winds did loud-ly roar,\r\n\r\n               When cold and sad there corned a lad\r\n\r\n                   Into a farimier’s door.\r\n\r\n               “‘Can you tell me,’ says he, ‘if any there be\r\n\r\n                   Who want to give emplo-o-o-o-o-o-y\r\n\r\n               For to plough and to sow, and to reap and to mow,\r\n\r\n                   And to be a farmier’s bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-y--\r\n\r\n                   To--be--a--farmier’s bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-y?’”\r\n\r\nAnother song referred to the charms of domestic life, and was evidently\r\ndirected with a fell, satirical purpose against Messrs. Simmons and\r\nLong, who were both hardened bachelors, and who, in Captain Corbet’s\r\nestimation, had shown a degree of callousness and indifference to the\r\nsweet attractions of domestic happiness which could not be too strongly\r\nrebuked.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Antelope was drawing nearer to Blomidon, and while\r\nlistening to Captain Corbet’s dulcet strains, they were gazing\r\nwith admiration at the dark promontory. None noticed that they were\r\napproaching a place where the water, agitated by the wind, and driven by\r\nconflicting currents, was tossing itself up into foaming waves; but all\r\nstood carelessly about, and the song and the laugh went on. Suddenly\r\nthe vessel seemed to give a jump, and then a plunge downward. At that\r\ninstant a wave came dashing over the bows, saturating to the skin a\r\nlittle crowd that had gathered there. Then, with a rush, and a crack,\r\nand a wild singing among the rigging, a squall struck the vessel. Over\r\nshe went on one side, while fresh waves dashed over her gunwale. In an\r\ninstant all was confusion. Every boy grasped some rope, and held on for\r\nhis life. The boys who had been drenched at the bows looked forlornly\r\nat their companions. Then--poof! came another blast, and away, away went\r\nfive dark objects careering through the air to leeward. A cry from the\r\n“B. O. W. C.” followed this last mishap. They had lost their hats,\r\ntheir beautiful plumed felt hats, their pride, their joy--lost them\r\ningloriously and beyond all hope of recovery. With doleful faces they\r\nlooked at one another, wondering what they could do. There were no more\r\nhats on board. They thought of handkerchiefs, and so one after another\r\nbound his handkerchief around his head. But now there was not much\r\nchance for lamentation over wet jackets or lost hats. A more dismal fate\r\nwas lowering over them. Each one knew it, saw it, felt it in his inmost\r\nsoul. For the sea was rough, and the little schooner pitched and tossed\r\nevery way, rolling, and leaping, and jumping, more than flesh and blood\r\ncould bear. At any rate, their flesh and blood could not bear it. A\r\nfeeling of wretchedness came to every heart; every face grew pale,\r\nand assumed an expression of woe. Suddenly Messrs. Long and Simmons\r\ndisappeared into the cabin. This was the signal for others. Many\r\nfollowed. A few, however, preferred the deck, with its fresh air, to\r\nthe close air and the sickening smell of bilge-water and potatoes, that\r\npredominated below. But the scene had changed for them as for all, and\r\nthe grandeur of Blomidon, and the magnificence of an iron-bound coast,\r\nwere forgotten. Hushed was the merry laugh, silent the melodious song.\r\nGone were the joyous young faces that but a short time before had looked\r\nout from the vessel upon the sea and sky. Faded were the bright eyes,\r\nscattered the bright visions of enjoyment. Alas, how changed!\r\n\r\nAnd now, as they, went on farther, the wind grew fresher, and the waves\r\ngrew rougher, and the little schooner danced about like a mad thing; and\r\nthe booms creaked against the masts, and the sails flapped furiously,\r\nand the blast went singing through the rigging. The wretched voyageurs\r\npaid no attention to it. Their thoughts were all turned inward. Little\r\ndid they think now of that which they had recently been celebrating so\r\njoyously:\r\n\r\n                   “A life on the ocean wave,\r\n\r\n                        A home on the rolling deep,\r\n\r\n                   “Where the scattered waters rave,\r\n\r\n               And the winds--and the wi-i-i-i-inds--and the w-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-nds\r\n\r\n                        their re-e-e-e-e-vels keep!”\r\n\r\nTime passed, and still the Antelope went tossing, and rolling, and\r\npitching onward.. How long a time no one knew. Not one of the voyageurs\r\nkept any account of that. Whether minutes or hours, they could not tell.\r\nIt seemed to them all one long duration, involving days or months. But\r\nat last the motion of the vessel ceased, and she went on more smoothly.\r\nMost of the boys below mustered up their courage, and began to think of\r\ngoing on deck once more. Soon the joyous voice of Bart Darner summoned\r\nthem up.\r\n\r\n“Come along, boys. We’re going to anchor. We’re at Five Islands.\r\nHurrah!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! Hurrah!”\r\n\r\nA loud cry arose. Up went the boys scrambling to the deck, and there the\r\nscene before them was sufficient to drive away all suffering. The water\r\nwas smooth, the wind was quieter. Before them lay the outlines of Five\r\nIslands, rising beautifully out of the water between them and the main\r\nland, the nearest one being not more than a mile away. These islands\r\nwere of different and peculiar shapes. The two more distant were rounded\r\nand well wooded; the third, which was midway among the group, had lofty,\r\nprecipitous sides, and the summit was dome-shaped; the fourth was like\r\na table, rising, with perpendicular sides, to the height of two hundred\r\nfeet, with a flat, level surface above, which was all overgrown with\r\nforest trees. The last, and nearest of the group, was by far the most\r\nsingular. It was a bare rock, which rose irregularly from the sea,\r\nterminating at one end in a peak, which rose about two hundred feet\r\ninto the air. As they approached it, this rock had a very peculiar\r\nappearance. It resembled, more than anything else, a vast cathedral\r\nrising out of the sea, the chief mass of the rock corresponding with the\r\nmain part of the cathedral, while the tower and spire were there in all\r\ntheir majesty. For this cause the rock has received the name of Pinnacle\r\nIsland. This lonely and desolate rock, that thus rose out before them,\r\ngrew more distinctly revealed as they drew nearer. At the base they saw\r\nthe white foam of breaking surf; while far on high, around its lofty,\r\ntempest-beaten summit, they saw myriads of sea-gulls. Gathering in great\r\nwhite clouds about this place, they sported and chased one another; they\r\nscreamed and uttered their shrill yells, which sounded afar over the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer they came, till at last they reached a smooth place on\r\nthe lee of the second island. This one was so close by Pinnacle Island,\r\nthat it seemed as though they might be joined at low water. Before them,\r\nwithin a moderate distance, lay a gravelled beach, which extended as\r\nfar as they could see at the verge of the island, above which the dark\r\ncliffs towered precipitously.\r\n\r\n“There!” said Mr. Simmons, pointing, with sparkling eyes, to the dark\r\nand sombre rocks,--“there, boys, is the place for minerals! I have found\r\non those rocks the most beautiful specimens, that have ever been seen,\r\nof crystals, of jasper, and of chalcedony. I have found onyx, spar, and\r\nhundreds of other stones; all kinds of agates, fragments of copper ore,\r\nbarytes, beautiful petrifactions, and footprints of birds among masses\r\nof sandstone. From those cliffs came the famous amethyst that was once\r\namong the crown jewels of Louis XV. Come, boys, be diligent; use your\r\neyes, and you will find something worth remembering. David Digg, don’t\r\nforget your hammers.”\r\n\r\nHis enthusiastic speech was interrupted by a loud shout from Captain\r\nCorbet.\r\n\r\n“Let go!” he cried.\r\n\r\nDown came the sails; and shortly after, rattle--rattle--rattle--rattle,\r\nand with a plunge and a splash, the anchor rushed to the sea bottom.\r\n\r\n“And now for the boats,” said Mr. Long.\r\n\r\nThe boat was brought up alongside. It was short, wide, and round, and\r\nappeared to have been constructed after the identical tub which had\r\nevidently served as a model for the Antelope. There was but one oar,\r\nwhich was used to propel the boat by sculling. Not more than five or six\r\ncould get into her with safety.\r\n\r\n“We can’t all go ashore in that,” said Mr. Simmons.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” asked Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“Why, she won’t hold us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she will.”\r\n\r\n“O, no.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse _me_, sir,” persisted Captain Corbet. “Of course you don’t all\r\nmean to go at once.”\r\n\r\n“O, I see,” said Mr. Simmons, whose mathematical mind began to grasp the\r\nsolution of the difficult problem. “You’ll make two or three trips with\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“O, that quite alters the case.”\r\n\r\n“Bless your heart, of course it does.”\r\n\r\n“Will we want any provisions?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Provisions! What for?”\r\n\r\n“Are we going to camp out?”\r\n\r\n“O, no. We’ll return to the vessel. But provisions! O, yes, we’ll want a\r\nlunch ashore, of course.”\r\n\r\nAnd now began the process of disembarkation. Messrs. Simmons and Long,\r\nwith two boys, went first. A number of baskets of provisions were thrown\r\nin, and the mate sculled them ashore.\r\n\r\nOn his return five more boys were ready. The “B. O. W. C.” generously\r\nwaited till the last. The loss of their hats had been a sore grievance,\r\nbut the handkerchiefs were not a bad substitute. Bart had his pistol\r\nin his belt, and a sailor’s knife. Bruce Rawdon had a beautiful little\r\nhatchet. The others had knives. When the boat returned, they were quite\r\nworn out with impatience, and were almost ready to jump overboard and\r\nswim ashore. But their time of waiting ended at last, and the boat\r\nlanded them on the gravelly beach..\r\n\r\nIt was about two o’clock when the party landed on the island. They had\r\nstarted at ten, three hours before high tide. The tide was therefore\r\nalready beginning to turn, and would of course continue to run out till\r\nseven or eight. On this account, the schooner could not come any nearer\r\nfor fear of being stranded. As they did not intend to pass the night on\r\nthe island, it was necessary, at all hazards, to keep the vessel afloat.\r\nCaptain Corbet had selected a place where he knew the vessel could ride\r\nat all times of tide; and though it was inconveniently distant, yet it\r\nwas the only place for her under the circumstances. Mr. Simmons had\r\ntold Captain Corbet that he would leave the island in three hours, after\r\nwhich the schooner was to sail to a port a few miles off on the main\r\nland, and anchor for the night. He had also taken care to let all the\r\nboys understand these arrangements perfectly, and had warned them not to\r\nbe too far away when the hour for leaving might come.\r\n\r\nAs the last of the passengers landed, they walked about the beach,\r\nlooking up at the gigantic cliffs, picking up the stones and shells, and\r\nexulting in the novelty of their situation. The island was about half a\r\nmile long, and about half that width. The beach was narrow; and the boys\r\nbegan to look, with longing eyes, to the summit of the island. In their\r\nwanderings they came across their companions. Mr. Simmons, followed by\r\nBogud, was busy at the rocks in one place. Mr. Long, with Billymack,\r\nwas working away near him. The baskets lay open, and all could help\r\nthemselves to lunch. After satisfying their hunger, the “B. O. W. C.”\r\n quickly determined to explore the island thoroughly, with the hope of\r\nfinding a way to the top. With this intention they started off, and at\r\nlength found a place which seemed to promise what they desired. It\r\nwas at the end nearest to Pinnacle Island. A torrent had made a rough\r\npathway for itself in that place, and though the stones were somewhat\r\ninsecure, yet it seemed safe enough for active lads.\r\n\r\nUp this place, then, they tried to climb. The footing was very insecure,\r\nthe loose stones constantly rolling down, and making it dangerous for\r\none to go behind another. It was so steep that they had to climb with\r\nhands as well as feet. They clutched the roots of trees, the long, tough\r\ngrasses, and the thick ferns. Thus pulling, pushing, clutching, dodging\r\nstones, and forcing a way up through all difficulties, they-managed to\r\nscramble to the summit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n_Exploring a desert Island.--Tumbling over a Cliff.--Peril of Bruce.--A\r\nmad Row over the waves.--Adrift in the Fog._\r\n\r\n\r\nON reaching the summit, the triumphant, climbers gave vent to\r\ntheir feelings in loud shouts. Looking out from their lofty perch, a\r\nmagnificent scene unfolded itself before their eyes. There was the broad\r\nexpanse of water. In the distance, a kind of haze rested over the\r\nhills, which, to experienced eyes, would have been significant of\r\nan approaching fog, but it gave no such warning to them. There rose\r\nBlomidon, always the supreme monarch of the scene. Around them were\r\nclustered the other islands; and here, directly opposite them, and\r\nbeneath them, was Pinnacle Island, with its cloud of screaming gulls.\r\nYet it was not to these, or to any one of these, that the eyes of the\r\nboys were most attracted. There, beneath them, lay another object, which\r\nhad for them a greater charm. It was the Antelope. There she swung at\r\nher anchor, while ever and anon the passing breeze, as it came by, swept\r\nout the folds of the black flag, from which that benevolent face,\r\nwhich it bore, seemed to look up at them with a grin of welcome,\r\nencouragement, and sympathy.\r\n\r\nIt was another proud moment for the “B. O. W. C.”\r\n\r\nAfter feasting their eyes on this fascinating flag, they all started\r\noff to explore the island. There was not much to explore; but what\r\nthere was, proved difficult. The trees grew densely, interlacing their\r\nbranches, while beneath them was a thick growth of underbrush and ferns.\r\nFallen trunks, some fresh fallen, others half rotted, intercepted them\r\nat every step; and they had to climb over them or crawl under. Progress\r\nwas extremely difficult, and a good half hour was occupied in going\r\nfrom one end’ of the island to the other. Here they rested for a while,\r\nlooking from the edge of the cliff down the precipice-into the sea. Then\r\nthey began to return, keeping along the edge of the island, where\r\nthe trees and the underbrush were not so dense. Beneath they could see\r\nMessrs. Simmons and Long diligently hammering away. Scattered along the\r\nbeach were the other boys. In the air, abreast of them, the sea-gulls\r\ndarted about with hoarse screams. One huge fellow flew straight toward\r\nthem, without seeing them, carrying a fish in his claws. The sight of\r\nthem so frightened him, that he dropped the fish, and flew off with a\r\nharsh shriek. On picking up the fish, they found it yet possessed of\r\nmuch vigor. Bruce took it and hurled it far out, and watched it to see\r\nwhere it would fall. It struck its own native element, into which it\r\nsank; and the boys generously hoped that it was able to resume its life,\r\nwhich had been interrupted by so wonderful a transition into the world\r\nof air.\r\n\r\nSo they wandered along, finding their way here much easier, and from\r\ntime to time stopping to examine some object of interest, to dart into\r\nthe woods after something that attracted their attention, or to lean\r\nover the cliff, and let stones fall, ‘and watch them as they fell\r\nstraight down, far, down, till they struck the beach below.\r\n\r\nBy and by they became scattered. Phil Kennedy and Tom Crawford had gone\r\nacross the island. Arthur and Bart were walking on, and Bruce lingered\r\nbehind to try and find a gull’s nest, which seemed to be somewhere over\r\nthe edge of the cliff. He lay down, and bent far over, and at length saw\r\nwhat he suspected. The gull that was on the nest flew away in affright,\r\nas she saw the face peering at her, and Bruce determined to seize the\r\neggs. But how could he? The nest was out of his reach, he scrutinized\r\nthe place narrowly, and at last concluded that it could be done. About\r\nthree feet beneath him was a projecting rock. On this he could Stand;\r\nand holding on to the root of a tree at the edge of the cliff with one\r\nhand, he could extend his other hand far enough to touch the nest. All\r\nthis he saw, and at once began to make the attempt. The edge of\r\nthe cliff was rocky, and hung over a foot beyond the precipice; the\r\nprojecting rock below did not come out so far. About five feet back, a\r\ntree grew, one of the roots of which had projected itself forward, and\r\ncrooked itself along the edge, and the earth having been blown away, it\r\nwas now exposed. This root Bruce grasped; and lowering himself over the\r\nedge, he let himself down till his feet touched the shelf; then lowering\r\nhimself still more, he prepared to reach out his hand.\r\n\r\nBut at that instant a thrill of horror shot through every nerve. The\r\nshelf on which he was standing seemed slowly to sink beneath him. Well\r\nfor him was it at that moment that he had not lowered, himself farther,\r\nand that there had not yet been time to extend his arm to the nest. The\r\nthrill of horror transfixed him. He sprang up, and grasped the root with\r\nboth hands. The next instant the shelf crumbled away, and his feet hung\r\nidly in the empty air. A wild shriek sounded out--a shriek of mortal\r\nterror, that sent an icy chill to the heart of Bart and Arthur, and\r\nbrought them back in mad anxiety and fear.\r\n\r\nFar below, Mr. Simmons had been busily hammering at the cliffs. His\r\nbasket was filled with unusually fine specimens, and he had just turned\r\nto send off Bogud with this basket to the landing-place. He was just in\r\nthe midst of some directions about a peculiar hammer which he wanted,\r\nwhen suddenly an immense mass of rock came thundering down, and buried\r\nitself in the gravel, not ten feet in front of him. Mr. Simmons started\r\nback, and rushed far out from the treacherous precipice. Looking up with\r\na white face, he sought to see the place from which the rock had fallen.\r\n\r\nHe looked up. A deeper, deadlier pallor came to his face; big drops\r\nstarted from his forehead; a shriek escaped him.\r\n\r\n“O, God! Who is it?” he groaned.\r\n\r\nFor there on the edge, grasping the tree-root with both hands, hung the\r\nfigure of a boy writhing as he sought to find some place for a foothold\r\nagainst the rock. Two figures were bending over.\r\n\r\nBy the red shirts which all wore, he knew that the one in danger must be\r\none of those five that had dressed themselves in this way. But which of\r\nthem it was, he could not tell.\r\n\r\nHis shriek roused others. Mr. Long came hurrying there, and the other\r\nboys, all looking up with eyes of horror and ashen lips. The moments of\r\nthat suspense were agony.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing that they could do. Mr. Long alone tried to do\r\nsomething. Starting off at full speed, he ran on, trying to find a\r\nplace to scale the cliff. Gradually a few others followed. But the rest\r\nthought it was of no use, and awaited the end in voiceless horror.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bruce Rawdon had clung to the root, shrieking for help, and\r\ntrying to find some resting-place for his feet. In vain he tried. The\r\nprecipice retreated inward, and the shelf that had fallen left a deeper\r\nhollow behind. Almost senseless with the horror of his situation, he was\r\nconscious of nothing but the fact that friends were near; and for these\r\nhe shouted, clinging desperately to the root of the tree. Another boy\r\nmight have fallen; but Bruce’s muscles had been toughened by all kinds\r\nof manly exercise, and he had in him the germ and the promise of mighty\r\nstrength and stature.\r\n\r\nThe shriek that roused Arthur and Bart was followed by others, which led\r\nthem speedily to the place.\r\n\r\nWith a groan Arthur flung himself down, and grasped his brother by the\r\nwrist. Bart took a swift glance around.. A small tree was growing near\r\nthe edge. Twining his sinewy legs around this, he bent his body over the\r\nprecipice, and caught Bruce by the waistband. Then, clutching the tree\r\nwith his legs, he made a mighty effort to raise Bruce. The latter, in\r\nthe mean while, had seized Arthur, who was also trying to raise him.\r\nBut Arthur had not a fair chance to exert his full strength, and so they\r\nprevailed but little against the dead weight which they were trying to\r\nlift.\r\n\r\n“Arthur!” cried Bart.\r\n\r\n“Well.”\r\n\r\n“Can you catch hold of this tree where my legs are? Hold it with one\r\nhand, and then you can pull better with your other. Can you do it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’ve got hold.”\r\n\r\n“Now then.”\r\n\r\nWith a tremendous effort, both boys pulled together. The slender tree\r\nbent beneath their efforts. But the weight was raised! Yes! O, thank\r\nGod! higher--higher! There was Bruce’s head at the edge, and now his\r\nshoulders. And now he himself, by a last; despairing, convulsive\r\neffort, had flung himself forward, and was on the rock. They dragged him\r\nforward. He was saved.\r\n\r\nArthur burst into tears, and held Bruce in his arms. Bart rushed off\r\nfor water. Returning in a few minutes with his leathern cup,--which he\r\nalways carried,--full of cold water, he gave it to Bruce. The fainting\r\nboy drank it, and then drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n“God bless you, boys!” he said at last, wringing the hand of each. He\r\nwould have said more, but he could not.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be all right’ presently,” said he, taking a long breath. “My\r\nheart feels painful;” and he pressed his hand against his breast. “Don’t\r\nbother any more, Bart. I’m coming round fast. Just let’s sit here, and\r\nbe quiet for a little while.”\r\n\r\nThey sat there in silence for some time; and gradually the color began\r\nto come back to Bruce’s face.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the crackling of brushwood was heard, avid Mr. Long came\r\nrunning up to them, his face as pale as death, and his eyes round with\r\nthe horror of a frightful suspense. The moment he saw the little group,\r\nhe flung himself on his knees by Bruce, and, catching him in his arms,\r\nhe kissed him again and again.\r\n\r\n“Thank God! O, thank God!” he moaned, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\nHitherto Mr. Long had the reputation, among the boys, of being a hard,\r\nunfeeling man; but from that moment this opinion was changed.\r\n\r\nMr. Long said nothing more at that time, partly because he did not wish\r\nto distress. Bruce by any questions just then, and partly because he\r\nwas so faint, from the tremendous rush up the cliff, that he could not\r\nspeak. In fact, for a time he seemed as much broken as Bruce. So they\r\nsat quietly together waiting.\r\n\r\nMr. Long’s effort was a desperate one, but the only thing to be done. It\r\nis possible that Bart and Arthur, if they could not have drawn up Bruce,\r\nmight have held him there for a long time, and in that case Mr. Long\r\nwould have been there to save him.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour, Bruce said he was all right, and they walked toward\r\nthe place of descent. It seemed, indeed, as though he had got over his\r\naccident. He said his arms ached a little, and there was a slight pain\r\nin his breast, but that it was passing away. The descent was toilsome,\r\nbut Bruce accomplished it as well as any of them. By the time he reached\r\nthe shore, he declared himself perfectly well.\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons was there to meet him. He wrung his hand very earnestly,\r\nwith tearful eyes, but did not trust himself to speak. Then Bruce told\r\nall about it, and the excitement of this adventure put an end to all\r\nfurther search for minerals.\r\n\r\nAt length five o’clock came, and they prepared to go back to the\r\nschooner. The tide had fallen considerably, and a strong current was\r\nrunning past them. The water was not so placid as it had been, but was\r\ngetting broken up, and somewhat rough. The wind had changed, and was\r\nblowing more freshly than before. There were also gathering fog banks,\r\nwhich were drawing nearer every moment, and threatening soon to be\r\naround them. All things showed, therefore, that it was high time to\r\nretire. Signals were made, and before, long they saw the boat leave the\r\nschooner, and come to the shore.\r\n\r\nOn landing, the mate wanted to know if any of them could scull a boat.\r\nBruce said that he could, and so did Arthur and Bart. The mate said that\r\nhe wanted to stay aboard to get the sails ready; and to save time, it\r\nwould be necessary for some one of them to bring the last boat aboard.\r\nEach one of these three offered to scull her; but it was at last decided\r\nthat Arthur should go in the second boat and bring her back, while Bruce\r\nshould take the last load. Bart readily gave up his claim to the others;\r\nand so it was arranged.\r\n\r\n“But are you sure you’re strong enough for that?” said Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“Strong? Of course.” said Bruce. “I’m stronger than ever, sir.”\r\n\r\nSo the first boat started with the same load which it had when landing\r\nbefore, with the addition of one boy more. The next boat took Arthur and\r\nfour more boys, leaving Bruce, and Tom, and Phil, and Bart.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour had passed between the time when the boat left to take\r\nthem from the island and the time when Arthur brought it back for the\r\nlast trip. In that hour many changes had taken place. The tide had\r\nfallen farther. Between the beach, where they stood, and Pinnacle\r\nIsland, the rocks were laid bare, and could be traversed on foot.\r\nBetween the schooner and the shore, a swift current was running,\r\nwhich grew stronger every moment. By six o’clock the current was very\r\npowerful. The mate, on his second trip, had considerable difficulty in\r\ngetting to the schooner; and he had given very careful directions to\r\nArthur as to the course which he should go in returning.\r\n\r\n“You must head the boat farther up,” said he, “so as to strike the\r\nscho’oner fair. I didn’t cal’late right about that there tide. You’ve\r\ngot to head your boat well off that side, and then the tide ‘ll help you\r\ninstead of henderin’.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\nIn going ashore, he found the current very strong; but the beach\r\nwas long, and, of course, it was very easy to land somewhere. As it\r\nhappened, he was carried down some fifty feet below the place which\r\nhe wished to reach; but that didn’t make any practical difference. It\r\nserved to open his eyes to the peculiar danger before them, and made him\r\nsee that the very greatest care would have to be exercised in returning,\r\nor else the swift tide would sweep them away from the place to which\r\nthey wished to go.\r\n\r\nAs Arthur looked round, after the other boys had got in, an exclamation\r\nburst from him.\r\n\r\n“Whew!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the fog. How suddenly it has come up! Why, it’s getting as thick\r\nas night. Look here, Bruce; we’ve got to be pretty careful this time.\r\nSee here; you must head out that way, for the current is running like a\r\nrace-horse, and this fog isn’t helping matters.”\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to explain to Bruce the best course to take, and Bruce\r\nsaid he would do exactly as he told him.\r\n\r\n“You’re sure you can do it. You’re sure you’re not used up at all,” said\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it!” said Bruce, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n“If I feel used up, I’ll hand over the oar to you or Bart.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he worked away with vigorous pushes, and the boat moved in\r\nthe direction indicated by Arthur.\r\n\r\nBruce soon found that Arthur had not exaggerated the force of the\r\ncurrent. It seemed to drag the boat sidewise with fearful power. But a\r\nstrong hand was at the scull, and the boat’s course was true, and every\r\nmoment brought them nearer.\r\n\r\nAs they went, the fog grew thicker at every foot. The wind blew more\r\nstrongly, and the water grew rougher, making the progress of the clumsy\r\nboat more difficult. Soon the shore grew indistinct; but this they did\r\nnot regard, since their eyes were fixed on the schooner, to which they\r\ndrew steadily nearer. There, on board, stood the-other boys; and Mr.\r\nSimmons was talking to Captain Corbet, and Mr. Long was watching them\r\nwith some anxiety. The mate stood near the bow with a rope, ready to\r\nthrow as soon as they should come within reach.\r\n\r\nBut though near enough to see all this, they could not hope to get there\r\nyet without a severe effort. For now the farther out they went, the\r\nstronger grew the current; and Bruce felt a heavier drag, against the\r\nboat, and gathered up his strength for sterner exertions. He took a\r\nhasty look at the schooner, so as to get her bearings, and then headed\r\nthe boat at a sharper angle against the current. This was admirably\r\ncalculated; and now the boat fell off less, and seemed to work itself\r\nsteadily toward the schooner.\r\n\r\nArthur was in the bows, anxiously watching the boat’s course. The other\r\nboys sat in silence, conscious of the hazard before them, but facing it\r\nbravely. On board the schooner not a word was spoken. Mr. Long’s face\r\nseemed to grow more anxious. His hands clutched one another with a rigid\r\ngrasp, and his eyes seemed fastened on Bruce. The mate stood with his\r\nrope, not venturing to make any suggestion, for he saw that Bruce was\r\ndoing all that could be done. His forehead was contracted into a painful\r\nfrown, and he was whistling softly to himself (from a habit that he had\r\nacquired), and which, in him, was a sign of grave perplexity of soul.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer came the boat; but the anxious watchers began to\r\nsee that, the current was swerving them off more rapidly than they had\r\nexpected, and that the angle of the boat’s drift would lie not so near\r\nas they hoped. Bruce saw this, and summoned up a new force out of his\r\nstrong muscles. A few mighty ‘strokes, and something was gained even\r\nagainst the pressure of that tremendous current. There was the schooner.\r\nOn--on; nearer--nearer.\r\n\r\nThey had hoped to touch her bow; but now they saw it would be well if\r\nthey could get near her stern. Back ran the mate with his rope. Not a\r\nword was spoken. No one ventured to call for greater exertions from\r\nthat brave, strong boy, who was plying his oar so mightily. And now the\r\nmoment had come. Forward sprang the mate, and the rope sped through the\r\nair. Arthur’s hands were extended to seize it. Bruce did not abate one\r\nstroke, but worked with desperate energy. The boat was borne past the\r\nschooner’s quarter. The rope touched Arthur’s right hand,--his fingers\r\nclosed around it.\r\n\r\nAlas! it was but the extreme end of the rope that he held; and before\r\nhis other hand could seize it, it had slipped through his fingers, and\r\nfell into the water.\r\n\r\n“Row, row, Bruce! I’ve dropped the rope!”\r\n\r\nA groan burst from Bruce. He gave three tremendous strokes. They were\r\nthe last efforts of despairing energy. As he moved his arms to make the\r\nfourth, he staggered back. The oar fell from his nerveless grasp. He\r\nsank down, with a groan, at the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\n“Boys, I--I’m dying!”\r\n\r\nGasping out these words, Bruce closed his eyes, and lay motionless.\r\n\r\nA cry of dismay and terror burst from the schooner. Pallid faces, and\r\neyes of horror, were turned toward the boat, which now, hurled on by\r\nthe swift current, was borne farther and farther away, until at last it\r\nvanished from view in the fog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n_Up Anchor and after them.--Blast of the Foghorn.--A long Search amid\r\nMists, and Darkness, and Storms._\r\n\r\n\r\nAS the boat drifted away from the schooner, horror for a time seemed\r\nto have struck dumbness into all on board. From this stupor Mr. Long was\r\nthe first to rouse himself.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” he cried, “we must up sail and after them.”\r\n\r\n“Which way shall wo go?”\r\n\r\n“After them any way. Follow the poor lads before they get any farther.\r\nCome, boys, up with the anchor! Corbet, up with your sails!”\r\n\r\nThe way that anchor was walked up was a wonder. In an incredibly short\r\nspace of time the schooner was dashing through the water, swept on by\r\nwind and tide.\r\n\r\n“Which way does this current take us?” asked Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“Well, right round the island, and down to Biomidon, and then out into\r\nthe Bay of Fundy.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t see the island.”\r\n\r\n“No; the fog’s too thick; but it’s right off there,” said Captain\r\nCorbet, waving his left hand.\r\n\r\n“I suppose the poor lads couldn’t work ashore.”\r\n\r\n“Not with, their bare hands. Their oar’s gone--that’s the mischief of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nMr. Long looked gloomily around.\r\n\r\n“The only thing, then, is for us to follow on where they may be\r\ndrifting.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve hit the nail on the head, sir. There’s nothin’ else for us--not\r\na hooter.”\r\n\r\n“How far is the main land from here?”\r\n\r\n“Several miles.”\r\n\r\n“Does the current strike near it anywhere?”\r\n\r\n“No, _sir!_ It goes straight in a bee line for Blomidon.”\r\n\r\n“After leaving this island, then, Blomidon is the nearest land for\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, or Parrsboro’.”\r\n\r\n“How long will it take them to drift there?”\r\n\r\n“About three hours.”\r\n\r\n“How far will they be likely to drift?”\r\n\r\n“Let me see. It’s seven o’clock now. It’s nearly dead low tide’. It’ll\r\nbe on the flood soon, and by the time them there lads get to Blomidon,\r\nthere’ll be a flood tide.”\r\n\r\n“And how will that be for them?”\r\n\r\n“It’ll drift ’em back.”\r\n\r\n“In which direction?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, sir, it would take a man with a head as long as a hoss, tail and\r\nall, to answer that there pint. Lor’ bless you, in this here bay there’s\r\nno knowin’ where the tide ‘ll drift a man.”\r\n\r\n“If it weren’t for the fog, there’d be no danger,” said Mr. Long,\r\nmusingly.\r\n\r\n“That there’s an ondeniable fact, at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think the fog will continue?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet screwed his head round in the direction of the wind, and\r\ndrew up his face into a most extraordinary grimace.\r\n\r\n“Well, I rayther think,” said he, slowly, “that you’ve got me there.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know, then, anything about it,” said Mr. Long, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Not a hooter.”\r\n\r\nMr. Long walked away, and looked mournfully out over the dim sea.\r\n\r\nDeep sadness and sore anxiety now reigned over the little vessel. Mr.\r\nSimmons said not a word, but sat staring fixedly at the fog. The boys\r\nstood in silent groups. Not a word was spoken.\r\n\r\nMr. Long walked forward to the bows, and looked out. The wind was\r\nincreasing, and the sea was growing rougher. Evening was passing away,\r\nnight would come--and then, what! To think of those poor lads in the\r\nboat was anguish. He walked back again to Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“Where are we now?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, we’re just roundin’ the island.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t see it.”\r\n\r\n“No, I have to give her a wide berth. It’s low tide, and the ledges are\r\ndangerous.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think the boat may be drifting out here, or nearer in shore?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, accordin’ to my cal’lation, they’d oughter be out here somewhere.\r\nJedgin’ by the direction the boat took, I should say I was followin’\r\npooty close in their track, though there’s no knowin’ for sartin.”\r\n\r\n“Oughtn’t we to be up to them by this time?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, I don’t know. You saw the pace they went off at. Geeracious! Talk\r\nof race-hosses! Why, that boat went off at a rate to beat all creation\r\nholler!”\r\n\r\n“But we’re going faster. We have the same current, and we’ve got sails\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“Never a truer word; but then it took some time for us to get a start,\r\nand in that time, gracious ony knows where they’ve got to. The ony thing\r\nthat we’ve got to do, as I can see, is to keep follerin’ our noses right\r\nstraight on, and keep in the current.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly a thought struck Mr. Long. Rushing down into the cabin, he\r\nreturned with a fog-horn, and raising it to his lips, blew a long,\r\npiercing blast.\r\n\r\n“That’ll fetch ’em, if anything does,” said Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“Silence!” cried Mr. Long, listening intently, while all others on board\r\nstood listening for the return cry.\r\n\r\nBut no sound came back.\r\n\r\n“They’ve got a pistol, and if they hear us, they would fire. Have you a\r\ngun, captain?”\r\n\r\n“Nary gun.”\r\n\r\n“This horn, then, is the best thing. Shouting is of no use,” said Mr.\r\nLong; and he blew another blast.\r\n\r\nAgain they listened, and again there was no response. To their waiting\r\nears, as they listened in an anguish of expectation, there came no\r\nanswering cry, no shout, no pistol shot--nothing but the plash of waves\r\nnear by, the singing of the wind through the rigging, and the boom of\r\nthe surf on some distant beach which the fog hid from view.\r\n\r\nOn went the schooner, and Mr. Long blew unweariedly, clinging to this\r\nhorn as something by which he still might gain access to the lost boys,\r\nand finding in this occupation something of that antidote to pain which\r\naction of any kind yields to the energetic nature. But time passed\r\non, and only the winds heard these shrill blasts, and only the winds\r\nresponded to the signal.\r\n\r\nSo darkness came upon them, and night; and the darkness of this night\r\nwas intensified, by the thick fog, so that it became a darkness which\r\nmight be felt.\r\n\r\n“Ef we want to save the boys,” said Captain Corbet at last to Mr. Long,\r\nwho stood dejectedly near him, “my opinion is, that we’d better keep\r\nafloat ourselves; but at the rate we’re goin’, it’s my opinion that\r\nbefore long we’ll be high and dry. And we may thank our blessed stars if\r\nwe light on a mud flat, and don’t get dashed to small bits on Blomidon.\r\nThem’s my sentiments.”\r\n\r\n“Why, don’t you know where you are?”\r\n\r\n“No more idee where I am than the man in the moon.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you knew the coast.”\r\n\r\n“So I do--like a book.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, then?”\r\n\r\n“Why, if it was only the fog, I wouldn’t mind; but, mind you, there’s\r\nthe tides. The flood tide ’ll be coming along soon, and then where’ll\r\nwe go to? We may get twisted up into an eddy, and find ourselves on\r\nCape Split; or we may glide up to Windsor, or get thrown on the rocks,\r\ngoodness ony knows where. There’s no knowin’ where these tides may take\r\nit into their blessed hearts to drift us to. So the long and the short\r\nof it is, I move we anchor.”\r\n\r\n“But isn’t it a common thing for schooners to drift about here?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the Basin of Minas, thank you. No, sir. Not if they can help it.\r\nOut in Fundy it’s different. Fundy hain’t got no bottom to anchor on,\r\nexcept near the shores. Fundy ain’t one universal mud bank, nuther.\r\nOut in Fundy every skipper cal’lates on driftin’, jest as a sea captain\r\ncal’lates on navigatin’ by scientific observation. Driftin’ in Fundy is\r\na science by itself, and vessels make v’y’ges back’ard and for’ard by a\r\nnew patent driftin’ process. But in here nobody drifts. It’s no go.”\r\n\r\nMr. Long gave a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, let’s drift a little longer. I cling to hope of coming up\r\nwith the boys.”\r\n\r\n“Comin’ _up_ with them! Law bless my heart alive, we’ve comed up with\r\n’em and passed ’em long ago. We’ve got on different tracks somehow.\r\nEf they’d been afloat, they’d never missed hearin’ that everlastin’\r\ntrumpet you’ve been a-blowin’ on so like all possessed.”\r\n\r\nNow all this time since they had left the anchorage the wind had been\r\nblowing strongly. As the darkness increased, Captain Corbet had taken\r\nin his foresail. The water grew rougher, the little schooner labored\r\nheavily, and pitched, and tossed, and rolled about, while the waves\r\ndashed over her bow. Mr. Simmons had retired to his berth with the\r\nbodily pangs of seasickness superadded to his mental anxiety. One by one\r\nthe boys had disappeared below, and for an hour or more none were left\r\non deck but Mr. Long, Captain Corbet, and the mate. A light had been\r\nhoisted, and Mr. Long still blew the fog-trumpet.\r\n\r\nBut he no longer blew it with any hope. Captain Corbet had presented\r\nfull before him a palpable fact, and that was, that they must be far\r\naway from any place where the boat could possibly be. They had sailed\r\non and passed beyond them. They could not have been near the beat at any\r\ntime. Some other current must have carried it away in another direction.\r\nHad it not been so, they must assuredly have heard those shrill yells,\r\nand in that ease they would have responded. Either they had been caught\r\nin another current, or else that had happened to them on which he dared\r\nnot think. But then, even so, if they had got into another current,\r\ncould it avail them? For that boat to drift out into this sea would be\r\nsure destruction.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said he, “are there more currents than one about those\r\nislands?”\r\n\r\n“As many currents as there is hairs on a hoss’s tail.”\r\n\r\n“Then it’s quite likely they got into another one.”\r\n\r\n“It’s sartin.”\r\n\r\n“Can you conjecture how they may have gone?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, you see the current we came by was a kind of inside one that took\r\nus round the nighest island. Now, outside of that there was another\r\ncurrent that kind V goes round the next island, which is a bigger one\r\nthan the one we were at. I’ve been turnin’ it over in my head, and I\r\ncal’late that that there boat, jedgin’ by the course she took as she\r\nshot by us, got swept into the outer current, and was driven away around\r\nthe outer island.”\r\n\r\n“We couldn’t have been near her at all, then.”\r\n\r\n“It seems not.”\r\n\r\n“Where could they have been when we began to blow?”\r\n\r\n“As near as I can cal’late, jedgin’ by the natur’ of the currents, and\r\nthe course they took, they might have been off the farthest end of the\r\nother island.”\r\n\r\n“How far away from the place where we were?”\r\n\r\n“Over two miles--yes, more’n three miles.”\r\n\r\n“How far can you hear one of these fog-horns?”\r\n\r\n“About a mile.”\r\n\r\n“So they couldn’t have heard us?”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t have heard a note. No, sir. And that accounts for their\r\nsilence.”\r\n\r\n“Where does the current go to, after going round that island you speak\r\nof?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, there’s a good many, but there’s two main currents: one goes round\r\nthe island, and returns and jines the one that we come down by.”\r\n\r\n“And if the boat came by that, it would be behind us.”\r\n\r\n“Jes so.”\r\n\r\n“About how far?”\r\n\r\n“O, ten miles or more by this time.”\r\n\r\n“If so, every moment now takes us farther from them.”\r\n\r\n“That’s about it, anyway you take it. But the flood tide’s catching us\r\nnow, and where it’s takin’ us to’s more’n I know.”\r\n\r\n“It will take the boat too.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; of course.”\r\n\r\n“You spoke of another current.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the other current sweeps around farther up, nigh unto the main\r\nland, and takes a turn and comes down, till it jines the gen’ral current\r\nalong with the others.”\r\n\r\n“So, if they had drifted into that, they would still be behind us.”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you think we are now?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t tell. Somewhere near Blomidon, though perhaps I’m jest as near\r\nHorton Bluff.”\r\n\r\n“How far would the boat drift till the tide turns?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, they would have time to drift nearly to Blomidon.”\r\n\r\n“And when the tide turns, you can’t tell where they’d go?”\r\n\r\n“No, _sir_--nor nobody else.”\r\n\r\n“What chance would there be of the boat keeping afloat?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n“It’s rough--precious rough. Ef it had been any other boys than them\r\nthere partic’ler boys, I’d have my doubts. They’d all be swamped, sure\r\nas a gun. But them there boys is oncommon lively creeturs. An’ they’ve\r\ngot a great idea of a rowboat, though they don’t know nothin’ of\r\nsailin’. They’d manage to keep afloat as long as anybody I know of.\r\nThey’d make a precious hard fight of it afore they’d knock under, mind,\r\nI tell you. They’re boys that are up to snuff. They mind me of my babby.\r\nMy babby is the cutest little creetur that ever I see in all my born\r\ndays. Why, that there infant last week--jest a week ago to-morrow--that\r\nthere infant--hallo--O--ah--hur--why, I declare--Mr. Long--why, he’s\r\ngone, ah’ hasn’t heard about the infant.”\r\n\r\nIt was a fact. Mr. Long had gone, and had lost the story of the infant.\r\nA moment afterward the shrill blast of the horn sounded out over the\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said he, as he came back again, “I won’t object any more to\r\nyour anchoring. Do as you choose. God alone knows what is best to do. He\r\nalone can save those dear boys. I must try to trust them to him.”\r\n\r\nA few moments after, the vessel was swinging at her anchor in twenty\r\nfathoms water.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet and the mate calmly retired to sleep, leaving the\r\nschooner to take care of herself. But there was one who slept not all\r\nthrough that night. Mr. Long could not leave the deck. The air below\r\nwas stifling to one so full of anxiety and suspense as he was. All\r\nnight long he paced the deck with unwearied footsteps,--all night\r\nlong,--stopping at times to sound his trumpet; stopping again to peer\r\nthrough the thick darkness that hung around like a funeral pall over the\r\ngrave of the departed. There, too, over and over again in the darkness\r\nand the gloom of that night, he knelt down on that deck, and poured\r\nforth all the anguish of his soul, calling forth out of his despair unto\r\nHim who alone is able to save. After each prayer his soul would grow\r\ncalmer, and the storm of his agitated heart would cease for a time,\r\ntill, gradually reassuming its strength, his grief would once more\r\nreturn, to be once more dispelled by prayer. So, amid vigil, and\r\nfasting, and prayer, and grief, passed, the night away; and when the\r\ndawn came, there stood this man looking out over the sea, with a face\r\npale from suffering, and eyes dimmed with unfamiliar tears.\r\n\r\nThe dawn of day brought at least one comfort. The wind had changed\r\nduring the night, and the fog had gone. The wide sea once more unfolded\r\nitself, and as the light grew stronger, Mr. Long eagerly scanned it in\r\nall directions in search after the lost ones. At last, rousing Captain\r\nCorbet and the mate, he urged them to set sail once more.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet came on deck, and looked round in great curiosity to\r\nsee where he was. He had gone to sleep in beautiful ignorance of his\r\nwhereabouts, and it had been an interesting problem as he dozed off to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe moment he looked around, he uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious!”\r\n\r\nMr. Long looked inquiringly at him.\r\n\r\n“Ef I ain’t back at my own door! Don’t you see it, Mr. Long? Why, darn\r\nme, ef we haven’t drifted clean back to Grand Pré!”\r\n\r\nMr. Long looked in wonder to where Captain Corbet pointed, and there,\r\nto his surprise, he recognized the familiar shore. A cloud came over his\r\nbrow. The thought of the lost ones came to him more vividly as he saw\r\nthe place which might possibly be doomed to know them no more forever.\r\n\r\n“Ef it warn’t-dead low tide,” said Captain Corbet, “darn it ef I\r\nwouldn’t have a good mind to tie up the old Anty to the nighest stump,\r\nand take a run up to see the babby.”\r\n\r\nMr. Long turned upon him with so terrible a frown that Captain Corbet\r\nwas awed.\r\n\r\n“O--I didn’t mean it. I--I ony made the remark. Of course I didn’t mean\r\nit--it’s ony a leetil outbust of parential affection.”\r\n\r\n“Come, make haste!” said Mr. Long, sternly. “There’s no time to lose. We\r\nmust scour the bay till we find the boys.”\r\n\r\nThe anchor went up, and up went the sails, and the Antelope once more\r\nspread her wings to the blast, and went over the waters.\r\n\r\nBut where could they go?\r\n\r\nThat was the question which it was difficult to answer. Where, or in\r\nwhat direction, east, west, north, or south?\r\n\r\nThrough all that day they sailed about. First, they went down the\r\nstraits past Blomidon; then, turning back, they stretched away far over\r\nto the farthest extremity of the bay. They spoke what vessels they met.\r\nThey watched every floating object, and it was with a feeling of relief\r\nthat each one resolved itself into a chip, or a shingle, or a log, and\r\nnever into a hat or the seat of a boat.\r\n\r\nSo passed the day.\r\n\r\nSearching in such a way, without any clew, it was difficult for them\r\nto feel that they were doing anything. While they were searching in\r\nthe east, the traces of the object, of their search might all be in\r\nthe west; and while they were examining the north, the boat might be\r\ndrifting in the south; or, while they were in the Basin of Minas, the\r\nboat might be helplessly carried about by the currents of the Bay of\r\nFundy.\r\n\r\nOne thing there was to comfort them; and that was, the departure of\r\nthe fogjdhe clear atmosphere, the pleasant breeze, the bright sunshine.\r\nSeveral vessels had been met with, and all had promised to keep a\r\nlookout and engage other vessels in the same service. On such a sea,\r\nand under such a sky, there could be no danger, if the boat had survived\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nBut _had_ the boat survived the night?\r\n\r\nAlas! and alas! who could answer that!\r\n\r\nMr. Long, at any rate, would not give up. As though in defiance of fate,\r\nhe would not haul down that flag which Bart had hoisted, but kept it\r\nflying, in the fond hope that it would once more greet their eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n_Lost in the Fog.--At the Mercy of the Tide.--The last Rock.--Wanderings\r\non a lonely Shore.--A great Discovery.--A new Mode of Cooking._\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANTIME, what had become of the boys? Was the “B. O. W. C.” thus\r\noverwhelmed beneath the dark wave? Were all the grief, and the watching,\r\nand the tireless search of the noble-hearted Mr. Long to be unavailing?\r\n\r\nWe shall see.\r\n\r\nAs the boat sped away, dragged on by the swift current, the boys sat\r\nin astonishment and consternation. Bart supported Bruce’s head,\r\nand Arthur hurried to the stern to assist. They wet his pale brow in\r\nsilence; while Bruce, in a faint voice, told them that he had been\r\nseized with a sudden spasm. He soon felt better, though unable to exert\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBy that time the fog had closed in around them, and both the schooner\r\nand the shore had been shut out from their view. They were drifting\r\nswiftly on, they could not tell where. For a long time they sat watching\r\nand waiting--how long they did not know. In seasons of suspense, moments\r\nare prolonged to hours; and so it was here. On they went, and still on.\r\nEach one well knew all the possibilities of the danger that lay before\r\nthem. There was a wide and a wild sea, overspread with fog-clouds, where\r\nthe waves were rising and the night was coming down. Into the midst of\r\nall this they were being borne by swift currents. This they all knew,\r\nyet not a sound of dismay escaped any one of them. Whatever each one may\r\nhave felt of fear, he sat in silence and gave no sign. There were\r\nstout hearts that beat in those slender, boyish breasts, that awaited,\r\nundismayed, the terrors of the deep.\r\n\r\nBart was the first to rouse himself.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said he, drawing forth a tin pail from under the seat, “we must\r\nfight for our lives, and make up our minds to pass the night here. Well\r\nhave to use this concern, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Here’s something, too, that may be of use,” said Arthur, drawing out\r\na narrow plank from the bottom of the boat. “Phil, there’s another one;\r\njust draw it out.”\r\n\r\nPhil reached down for it, but Tom Crawford dragged it out first.\r\n\r\n“I’m stronger than you, Phil,” said he. “If there’s to be any paddling,\r\nI’ll do it.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Arthur drew his knife, and began cutting at the plank so as to\r\nfashion it into an oar. Tom did the same.\r\n\r\nSoon they were interrupted by a shout from Bart.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah, boys! Land! land!” he cried. “Look! look!” and he pointed to the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nTrue enough, there was the dim outline of black cliffs rising high not\r\nfar away. Past these they were drifting. In an instant Arthur and Tom\r\nput out their planks, and began to use them as paddles, in the Indian\r\nfashion, heading the boat toward the shore, and putting forth all their\r\nstrength. Bart, too, tried to use his dipper for a paddle.\r\n\r\nThe boat drifted on; but the current swept them in nearer and nearer.\r\nSome progress was also made by the paddles, rude though they were.\r\n\r\nBorne on by the tide, the boat every moment drew nearer to the shore;\r\nyet every moment it was swiftly drifting by, and it now became a\r\nquestion whether it would be at all possible for them to reach, the\r\nland. Already they could see the end of the island, a precipitous cliff,\r\nnot far away, toward which they were drifting. A few minutes more, and\r\nthey would be there.\r\n\r\nThe cliff was high. At its base there was a ledge of rocks, which ran\r\ndown into the water. At this low tide the ledge extended for a long\r\ndistance, and terminated in a projecting mass, which was covered with an\r\nimmense growth of sea-weed.. Around this point the current passed, and\r\nit was to this that the boat was speeding.\r\n\r\nAnd now all their exertions were put forth to extricate the boat from\r\nthe central grasp of the current. Already, thanks to their former\r\nexertions, they had forced it from the centre to the edge of the tide,\r\nand a few more vigorous efforts might bring them to the shore.\r\n\r\nBut so swift was the tide, that it seemed about to snatch them away from\r\nthat shore when it was just within reach. It seemed as though they could\r\nalmost have waded ashore if they had jumped overboard. But that, of\r\ncourse, could not be done, for the power of the current would have swept\r\nany one away who should try it.\r\n\r\nTo every stroke of the rude paddles the tide brought a counteracting\r\ninfluence; and for every six inches of forward motion, there were two\r\nfeet of sidelong drift. The boat’s head was toward the shore, but\r\nher motion was broadside; and so the shore seemed ever near, yet\r\ninaccessible, and most unattainable when most within reach.\r\n\r\nAnd so on past the whole length of the island, until the cliff at the\r\nfarthest extremity was reached and passed. They were but ten feet from\r\nthe shore. The rocky ledge, covered with sea-weed, still extended before\r\nthem. It was to this that they now tried to force the boat.\r\n\r\nTen feet! Only ten feet! And the ten feet lessened to nine, and the nine\r\nto eight, and the eight to seven, and the seven to six.\r\n\r\nBut six feet between them and the shore!\r\n\r\nBut six feet! Would they--could they--fail at last?\r\n\r\nSix feet only! But the tide was wild and strong, and now, at this last\r\ncrisis of their fate, seemed like some living monster, fearful that\r\nhis prey was escaping from his power. It was as though his grasp\r\nwas fastened on them with a fiercer clutch and a more desperate\r\ntenacity,--as though, at this supreme hour, he had risen in his might,\r\nand, even at the very gate of his domain, had seized them, and was\r\ntrying to draw them to destruction.\r\n\r\nBut six feet! Yet between them and the rock of their hope, even in those\r\nfew feet of watery distance, what risks and dangers lay--what chances of\r\nloss--what baffled hopes--what despair!\r\n\r\nThe suspense was anguish.\r\n\r\nOn they went with the fury of the torrent. “O, why haven’t I a paddle!”\r\n groaned little Phil Kennedy. Bruce raised himself, and looked around,\r\nwith his pale face and staring eyes. Arthur, and Tom, and Bart put forth\r\ntheir last energies.\r\n\r\nFour feet!\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken. The tightly compressed lips, the resolute eyes,\r\nthe frowning brows of the struggling boys, spoke of their resolution;\r\ntheir panting, heaving breasts told how heavily they labored with their\r\nclumsy, unwieldy oars.\r\n\r\nA roar sounded in their ears to the right. It was the rush of the\r\ncurrent as it swept past the extreme verge of the ledge. There was the\r\nopen sea. There lay their last chance; beyond it--destruction.\r\n\r\nThey knew it--they felt it. That sound struck on their ears like the\r\nknell-of doom. One last effort--one superhuman struggle. Nearer came the\r\nboat; although even then trembling on the extreme verge, yielding to the\r\ncurrent, it turned slightly, bringing its head closer to the rock.\r\n\r\nIt was done.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, arms were outstretched, and Bart’s hands were clinging to\r\nthe sea-weed. For a moment the boat was checked.\r\n\r\nTom Crawford and Phil Kennedy grasped the sea-weed also; and at that\r\ninstant, Arthur, seizing the boat’s rope, sprang ashore. His leap jerked\r\nthe boat, which, caught by the tide, was swept off, leaving masses of\r\nsea-weed, torn from the rocks, in the hands of the boys.\r\n\r\nA cry of despair arose.\r\n\r\nBut Arthur held the rope wound about his hands. As the boat moved, he\r\nsteadied his feet for the struggle. The swift tide bore it off. As the\r\nrope tightened out, the fury of the current, driving against the boat,\r\ncontended with the strength of that one boy. For a moment it was the\r\nboy who lost. At the first jerk, his feet slipped on the treacherous\r\nsea-weed. He fell. He was dragged toward the water.\r\n\r\nNo sound escaped from those in the boat,--not a word either of fear for\r\nthemselves or of encouragement or warning to Arthur. Well they knew that\r\nArthur would die on the rocks, or be drowned in the sea, rather than\r\nlose his hold of that rope, which, in his desperate purpose, he had\r\ntwisted round his hands.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Arthur could not recover himself. On that slippery\r\nsea-weed there was no foothold. He was drawn nearer and nearer to the\r\nwater. He looked around hastily. At last he saw the round top of a\r\nboulder a little on one side. To this he managed to work himself,\r\nletting the boat yield to the tide still more as he did so. A few steps,\r\nand he was there. He plunged into the water, he pressed his feet against\r\nthat stone, and then, drawing himself back, he pulled with all his\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThe boat yielded. The power was now in his hands. Grasping the rope\r\nnearer, he drew the boat in more closely, and at last it touched\r\nthe-shore.\r\n\r\nThey were saved at last!\r\n\r\nOut leaped Bart into the water, and, holding the boat, he added his\r\nstrength to that of Arthur. The others followed as quickly as possible.\r\nBruce had begun to regain his strength once more, and was able to get\r\nout without help. The unparalleled exertions which he had undergone on\r\nthe cliff had given a severe strain, which, in his final struggle to\r\nreach the schooner, had resulted in a spasm of his heart. From this he\r\nwas now rallying once more. Joy at reaching the land did much to restore\r\nhim, and he was soon able to start wherever the others wished to go.\r\n\r\nTheir first movement was to go away from the ledge farther up to the\r\nbeach. The rocks were flat, and not very difficult to walk over.\r\nThey towed the boat as they went, which was a difficult task, but\r\nsuccessfully accomplished. After severe exertions, they at length\r\nbrought the boat about a quarter of a mile up to a place where there was\r\nan indentation in the line of shore, and scarcely any current. Here they\r\nhauled it up some distance, and fastened it securely. After this they\r\nwent up to the gravelly beach at the foot of the cliff, and sat down to\r\nrest for a while, and to consider the situation.\r\n\r\nThe fog was as thick as ever, and they could see but a little distance\r\nalong the beach, or out on the water. The side of the island on which\r\nthey found themselves was sheltered from the chill wind. As to the boat,\r\nit was impossible to draw it up any farther. It would be necessary to\r\nwait until the tide rose higher, before they could bring it into a place\r\nof safety. But little could be done, except watch it from time to time.\r\n\r\nIt was now late, and darkness was coming on rapidly. Soon they would’ be\r\nsurrounded by the impenetrable shades of night. Bart and Arthur offered\r\nto go along the shore and find some place where they could pass the\r\nnight, leaving the others to watch the boat, and see if there were any\r\nsigns of the schooner.\r\n\r\nBut then the important question arose, what should they do for their\r\nsuppers? For a time this puzzled all of them.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what it is, boys,” said Bart at last; “I think I know how\r\nto get something; We passed a place down on the shore where there were\r\nlots of mussels. Tom, you come along with me, and Phil can go with\r\nArthur. Bruce may watch here.”\r\n\r\nThis plan was eagerly adopted; and as there was no time to lose, the\r\nboys set out. Fortunately, the place spoken of by Bart was not far\r\naway, and fortunately, too, the rocks were covered with shell-fish of\r\ndifferent kinds, and the hollows of the rocks filled with them. Tom and\r\nBart heaped them into their handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n“Hallo!” cried Bart, suddenly, in a joyous tone. “See here, Tom.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Come here.”\r\n\r\nTom went, and found Bart plunging his hands most vigorously into a pool\r\nof water, which the retreating tide had left in a rocky hollow.\r\n\r\n“What have you got there?”\r\n\r\n“I call them shrimps,” said Bart, holding one up in his hands. “They’re\r\nrather small, though. Go about and hunt up another hole.”\r\n\r\nTom went off, and in a short time called to Bart in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nBart started up.\r\n\r\nTom was walking toward him with a large, dark object in his hand.\r\n\r\n“A lobster!” cried Bart. “A lobster! Hurrah! and hurrah again! Tom,\r\nyou’ve saved us all from starvation. Good on your head. We needn’t wait\r\nhere any longer, for it’s getting dark, and we’ll have to join the other\r\nfellows.”\r\n\r\nOn returning to Bruce, they displayed their treasures, to the great\r\ndelight of all. Arthur and Phil had also been successful. Walking\r\nfarther up the beach, they had come to the end of the cliff, and reached\r\na steep, well-wooded bank. It was not far away, and there were fir\r\ntrees, from which they could easily cut enough brush to make very\r\ncomfortable beds. There was also plenty of drift-wood, with which they\r\ncould make a fire.\r\n\r\nWithout any more delay, the boys all started off, first marking the\r\nplace so as to know where to go for the boat. Beaching the bank, they\r\ngathered drift-wood, and logs, and fir-brush, with which they built a\r\nfire on the beach at the foot of the cliff, where it adjoined the bank.\r\nThey had plenty of matches in their pockets, and soon the fire was\r\nlighted; the flames rushed fiercely through the inflammable brush-wood,\r\nand the boys kept gathering fresh fuel from all sides and heaping it on.\r\n\r\n“And now to cook our tea,” said Bart. “Let’s get a lot of stones, and\r\nput them in the fire till they get red hot. Then we can draw them out,\r\nand roast all our shell-fish splendidly.”\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was at once acted on, and the boys gathered stones and\r\nthrew them in.\r\n\r\nAfter this they all went to work collecting driftwood from all sides,\r\ntill a large pile was heaped up, sufficient to last them through the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThen, in turn, each one took the hatchet and went up the bank, and cut\r\nas much fir-brush as he considered necessary for a bed. The darkness had\r\nincreased, and the fog intensified it; but the towering flames, as they\r\nleaped up, illumined the scene, affording them sufficient light to cut\r\nthe brush, and throwing a strong glare along the beach as far as the\r\nplace where their boat lay.\r\n\r\nAnd next, they pulled out the stones from the fire, and arranging some\r\nof them in the sand, they laid the lobster on the top, and piled other\r\nstones around them, till the lobster lay buried in an oven as good and\r\nas serviceable as that of the best kitchen range. A number of shell-fish\r\nwere thrown on other stones, and the shrimps were easily cooked by being\r\nlaid on the top of a hot stone for a few minutes. While waiting for the\r\nlobster, they appeased their hunger by cooking and eating these smaller\r\nfry.\r\n\r\n“I never ate baked lobster,” said Bruce; “but I’ve heard that it’s the\r\nbest thing there is.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll soon judge for ourselves,” said Bart. “Only before we fairly sit\r\ndown to dine, let’s go off and draw the boat up farther.”\r\n\r\nFour of them started off. They found that already the tide had risen\r\nso far that it was level with the bows. A long and vigorous exertion\r\nenabled them to draw it up farther, and then they went back to the fire.\r\n\r\nBy that time it was decided that the lobster had been baking long\r\nenough, and it was accordingly uncovered.\r\n\r\nA cry of delight escaped them.\r\n\r\nThere lay the lobster, brilliantly red, as though red hot from the oven,\r\nand showing clearly the excellence of Bart’s contrivance.\r\n\r\n“That’s the way the Micmacs manage,” said Bart. “And they wouldn’t look\r\nat a lobster that came out of a pot.”\r\n\r\nRanging themselves around the lobster, in front of the fire, the boys\r\nnow began their repast. One and all pronounced it glorious. It was salt\r\nenough and juicy enough to satisfy the most delicate palate; and the\r\nsevere exercise and long fast of the boys had given them appetites which\r\nwould have made a worse dish acceptable.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Bart, “here we are on a desert island, without a\r\npenny in our pockets; but it isn’t a bad place, after all.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if they will hunt after us.”\r\n\r\n“Of course they will.”\r\n\r\n“They ought to see this fire, at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“I thought of that, and expected to see some signs of them before this.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it’s too foggy.”\r\n\r\n“O, if they were within a mile of us, they’d see that light.”\r\n\r\n“I should think, if they came after us, they would have been within that\r\ndistance.”\r\n\r\n“O, we can’t tell. They may have got into another direction altogether.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose they’ll find us some time.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I don’t care.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do I.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to prepare for life on a desert island. To-morrow we’ll\r\nexplore it, and build Our camp. It’s lucky we have a hatchet and a\r\npistol.”\r\n\r\n“It’s lucky we have lobsters.”\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll find lots of other things. There are sea-gulls’ eggs, I’ll\r\nbet.”\r\n\r\n“And clams.”\r\n\r\n“And perhaps oysters.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to organize a government, and build a town. Wigwams will\r\nmake the best houses.”\r\n\r\n“No--spruce camps.”\r\n\r\n“O, wigwams are the only things that will keep the rain off.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if we can find any birch bark.”\r\n\r\n“We must explore to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“There’s one thing more to do to-night,” said Arthur. “For my part, I\r\ndon’t want to have to run down to that miserable boat every ten minutes\r\ntill high tide. I’ve had enough of her for one day. We must get her up\r\nnow. There’s a lot of round sticks in that pile, and we can use them as\r\nrollers; so let’s go and get the boat up now.”\r\n\r\nThis proposition was at once acted on. Four good round sticks were\r\nfound, and some others to serve as levers. With these the boys started\r\noff to move the boat.\r\n\r\nThey found it hard work, but practicable. The progress was slow, and it\r\ntook a good hour; but at last they had the satisfaction of seeing the\r\nboat above high-water mark, and fastened to a piece of projecting rock.\r\n\r\nThen they selected sleeping places, and spread their beds. After this\r\nthey heaped up fresh fuel, and sat around the fire, making a hundred\r\nplans for their desert life. Arthur was the only one who did anything.\r\nHe had found a piece of tough spruce, and with hatchet, and knife was\r\nbusily shaping it into an oar.\r\n\r\nAt last they all retired to their beds, and slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n_Blue Sky.--Building a House.--The Signal Staff.--A fatal\r\nDisgust.--Mournful Forebodings._\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY the next morning the boys were all up, quite refreshed, in\r\nspite of their unaccustomed beds. They gathered the embers of the fire\r\ntogether, and heaping on fresh fuel, started it into a blaze. Then they\r\nproceeded to secure a breakfast. This could not be immediately attended\r\nto, however, for the tide was not at its lowest ebb, and it was\r\nnecessary to wait for two or three hours. Enough shell-fish remained to\r\nstay their appetites till something better could be procured.\r\n\r\nTo their great joy, they saw that the fog had all gone. A warm, fresh\r\nbreeze was blowing, the sky was clear and cloudless, and the sun rose\r\nbrilliantly, casting his dazzling rays in a radiant flood of lustre\r\nacross the sea. If there had been any feeling of discontent, it would\r\nhave been dispelled by the grandeur of the scene.\r\n\r\nSome eight or ten miles away they saw the main land. Far away, on the\r\nother side of the bay, they saw a line of hills, terminating in the\r\nfamiliar form of Blomidon, while, looking along the beach, they saw\r\nlying beyond this island the one on which they had landed the day\r\nbefore. They now knew that they had drifted past that, and had gone\r\nashore on the adjoining one, and they could understand the whole of that\r\ncourse which they had made blindly through the fog. It was with much\r\neagerness that they looked around for the schooner. But they saw no\r\ntraces of her whatever. The place where she had anchored was plainly\r\ndiscernible, but she had gone. It was not difficult to know the reason\r\nof this, since it was the very thing which they expected would happen.\r\nBut where was the schooner now? Which way had she gone? When would she\r\nreturn? How could those on board possibly find them out? All these were\r\nquestions which it was not easy to answer.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the tide to fall, they wandered up the banks in order\r\nto select some place suitable for a camp. It was not long before they\r\nsettled on a spot which seemed very suitable. Near where they had built\r\nthe fire, the cliff ended, and the side of the island became a wooded\r\nslope. About fifty feet above the fire, there was a broad, open\r\nplatform, free from trees and covered with moss. Walking on beyond this,\r\nthey ascended to the edge of the cliff, where it stood up two hundred\r\nfeet above the shore. Here grew a solitary tree about fifty feet\r\nhigh, and very conspicuous from its situation. Around it the rock was\r\nuncovered in places.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of these places filled them with delight. They had already\r\ndecided to build a camp, and the platform first mentioned seemed to all\r\nto be very suitable.\r\n\r\n“But we must find a spring somewhere,” said Bruce, who, after his\r\nnight’s rest, declared himself as well as ever.\r\n\r\n“So we must,” said Bart. “Boys, let some of us hunt up a spring.”\r\n\r\nOff they went in different directions, and soon every one was shouting\r\nout a discovery of water. In fact, in that damp and well-watered\r\ncountry, springs can easily be found on every hill-side. The nearest one\r\nwas the best, and by breaking away some of the earth and digging a hole\r\nwith a stone in the clay of the bank, a well was rudely formed, which\r\nwas suitable for all immediate needs.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had finished these explorations, the tide was\r\nsufficiently low to admit of a search for their breakfast. All the boys\r\nwent off, since all were equally interested. The search was perfectly\r\nsuccessful, resulting in the capture of thirteen lobsters and a great\r\nquantity of shrimps. Bringing back their prey in triumph, they heated a\r\nlarge number of stones and cooked all the lobsters together, partly for\r\nthe sake of keeping them better, and partly that they might have a good\r\nsupply of ready-cooked provisions on hand.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, boys,” said Phil Kennedy, as they sat at breakfast, “I’ve\r\ngot an idea?”\r\n\r\n“Good for you. What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, we ought to have a signal.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my plan is to have a signal up there,” said Phil, pointing to the\r\nsolitary tree on the top of the cliff.\r\n\r\n“How can you manage it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, turn that tree into a flag-staff by cutting off the branches.,\r\nI can climb it, and if I can have the hatchet for a little-while, I’ll\r\npromise to get every branch off.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, Phil,” said Bruce, “I call that a first-rate idea. But where\r\nwill you get a flag?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll fasten my red shirt on.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried all, clapping Phil on the back. “Phil, you’re a genius.”\r\n\r\n“Talking about signals,” said Tom Crawford, “a flag won’t be enough. We\r\nwant something for nights and for foggy days. We ought to build a\r\nheap of dry brush and kindling, and be ready to light it at a moment’s\r\nnotice. Perhaps it would be too much trouble to keep it going all\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it would,” said Bruce. “The best thing would be to have a pile\r\nready to light. But the first thing to do is to build our camp, and\r\nwe’ll have lots of brush ready for the pile. Phil can have the hatchet\r\nto trim the tree after we have cut the poles and things for the camp.”\r\n\r\n“What kind of a camp shall we have?”\r\n\r\n“A wigwam.”\r\n\r\n“Where’ll we get the birch bark?”\r\n\r\n“Explore the island.”\r\n\r\n“That’ll take too much time. We want a camp to-day, and a camp we must\r\nhave. The best way will be to build an ordinary one of poles and spruce\r\nbrush, and after that is built, we can look about for birch bark.”\r\n\r\n“And then I’ve got my oar to finish,” said Arthur, who had been working\r\non it at intervals all the morning.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “suppose we go to work at the camp first. We’ll want\r\nsomething to fasten it with. If you like, I’ll go and hunt after some\r\nroots that I know of. They’ll do first rate for ropes.”\r\n\r\n“All right; and we’ll go and cut the poles.”\r\n\r\nOff they went, four of them after poles and brush, and Bart after roots\r\nfor ropes. The hatchet served to cut the poles, and the knives to trim\r\nthem. Four industrious boys, working diligently at this, soon laid low a\r\nlarge number of straight, slender maple trees and an immense quantity\r\nof fir branches. These they all dragged to that platform which they had\r\nselected as the site of their house, and then looked about to find\r\nthe best situation for the temporary camp. As they expected to build a\r\nbetter one, they chose a place which would not interfere with any future\r\noperations. It was at the rear of the platform. Four trees grew there,\r\nat nearly equal distances, in the form of a square. They determined\r\nto adopt these trees as part of the frame of the camp, and use them as\r\ncorner posts. Bart had succeeded in finding an immense quantity of long,\r\nflexible roots, some of which were sassafras roots, others the long\r\nroots of willow trees, and all very tough and strong. First of all,\r\nthey laid four of their strongest poles from tree to tree, the rear pole\r\nbeing about eight feet high, and the front one five feet. The side poles\r\nsloped up from front to rear. There they stuck a large number of poles\r\ninto the ground in front, on the sides and in the rear, about a foot\r\napart, leaving space for a door and a window. Then they laid poles over\r\nthe top crosswise, so as to form a good foundation for a roof. All these\r\nwere firmly fastened, so that at last, when the frame was completed, it\r\nwas as secure as though it had been nailed together; in fact, much more\r\nso.\r\n\r\nSo far, all had been well and successfully accomplished; but the next\r\ntask was a more difficult one. This consisted in interweaving fir brush\r\nbetween the poles, so that they should be firm and strong. Beginning at\r\nthe bottom, each bush was carefully inserted and pressed as closely down\r\nas possible. It was a tedious process; but the five industrious boys\r\nworked unweariedly, and at last had the satisfaction of seeing the rear\r\nand the right side completed. Then they concluded to rest for a while\r\nand dine.\r\n\r\nCold lobster and cold water were all the fare that they could command;\r\nbut they ate with a good appetite, and greatly enjoyed the brief respite\r\nfrom their hard work. After this was over, they returned to their task,\r\nand at length completed the front and the left side.\r\n\r\nNow the roof remained. This was the most difficult task of all. Three\r\nboys went on the roof, and two below handed up brush as fast as it was\r\nrequired. They began at the lower side in front, and inserted the brush\r\nso as to lie along the slope of the roof like thatch. The butt-end of\r\neach bush was inserted, and the brush ends projected. The flat branches\r\nof fir trees are of such a nature that they will lie very close to any\r\nsurface on which they may be placed. These brushes were all placed in\r\ndouble layers; each upper row overlapped the lower one; and thus a roof\r\nwas formed thick and close enough to turn any ordinary fall of rain,\r\nthough, of course, it could not be expected to keep out the water in\r\ncase of a prolonged storm. After the roof was all covered, the last\r\nbrush at the upper edge was intertwined with others which were placed\r\nacross them, and these again were all securely fastened to the poles\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThen their spruce camp was finished, and was almost an exact counterpart\r\nof the one which they had built in the woods. They had done it well and\r\nquickly, for long practice in this work in their own woods had given\r\nthem great skill in the construction of such buildings as these.\r\n\r\nThe last thing to attend to was the beds. All the brush that remained\r\nwas brought inside and laid lengthwise at-the rear of the camp. Then\r\nthey went into the woods, and gathered an immense quantity of dry, soft\r\nmoss, which they spread over the spruce brush. In this way they formed a\r\nbed large enough for the whole party, as soft as a hair mattress, and as\r\ngood as anything can be for the repose of a weary frame.\r\n\r\nThis completed their work, and it was not yet sundown. They had worked\r\nnobly; and when they stood out on the platform, and regarded their\r\nhandiwork, their delight burst forth in ringing cheers.\r\n\r\nAnd now Phil claimed the hatchet, so as to carry out his cherished\r\npurpose of forming a signal staff. The others all went up to watch him\r\nat his work. Phil climbed up without any difficulty, and began at the\r\nupper branches, cutting away on a level with his waist, and using the\r\nlower ones to stand on. Phil was skilful with his hatchet; the branches\r\nwere not large, and came tumbling down, beneath his strokes, with great\r\nrapidity. These the boys below gathered together, and heaped up in a\r\npile, at a sufficient distance off to burn without injury to the signal\r\nstaff, and yet in such a situation that any flame would be conspicuous\r\nto those on the sea. The work was soon accomplished; the last branch\r\nfell, and Phil descended to the ground. Where the tree had lately been\r\nthere now arose a tall staff, naked, and ready to bear at its summit a\r\nred shirt, a pair of trousers, or anything else which the fancy of Phil\r\nmight suggest as suitable to the place and the occasion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Arthur had gone to the beach, and returned with an armful of\r\nshavings and choppings from the wood which he had been trying to fashion\r\ninto an oar. They were dry and fine, and were intended to serve as\r\nkindling whenever the time might come for kindling the signal fire.\r\n\r\nAnd now one thing more remained to be done. They had decided to have\r\ntheir fire on the platform in front of the camp--a place which was\r\ngreatly superior to the beach for such a purpose, and which also would\r\ngive them the advantage of a warm fire on a cool evening and a light\r\nclose by their dwelling-place. So they went out to collect drift-wood,\r\nand carried up a large quantity to the place. Good stones were also\r\nselected for cooking purposes, and the cold lobsters were carefully\r\nbrought from the beach, and deposited in the camp. But the labor of\r\ncarrying the drift-wood up the steep bank showed them that it would\r\nbe as well not to be too lavish with their fuel. In order to have the\r\ncheerfulness of brilliant light along with the gratefulness of warmth,\r\nthey cut a quantity of brush, which they intended to throw on the fire\r\nfrom time to time. Thus, with a comfortable camp, and soft beds of moss,\r\nand plenty of fuel, and a pleasant fire, with food and drink, with fine\r\nweather and a charming view, the “B. O. W. C.” might be considered as\r\ntolerably happy.\r\n\r\nAnd so they would have been, if it had not been for one thing--a thing\r\nwhich revealed itself to them during their evening repast, and soon\r\nthrew a gloom over their prospects.\r\n\r\nIt was dark; the fire was lighted, and threw out a cheerful glow; the\r\ncold lobster was brought out, and the boys began to partake. For some\r\ntime nothing was said. At last, the silence was broken by Bart. He had\r\nbeen twisting a leg of the lobster fastidiously in his fingers, and\r\nnibbling little morsels of it, in a way which did not look very much\r\nlike the fashion of a hungry boy who had done a good day’s work, when\r\nsuddenly he flung the lobster’s leg into the fire.\r\n\r\n“I can’t stand the abominable stuff any longer,” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Neither can I,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Nor I”--“Nor I”--“Nor I”--said all the others; and the fragments of the\r\nlobster were all contemptuously thrown away.\r\n\r\n“What are we going to do about it?” asked Tom Crawford, mournfully.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t care if there was even a raw potato,” said Bart, “or a\r\nmouldy ship-biscuit, or an old dried turnip, or a bit of pork, or\r\nanything else to eat with it so as to take off the edge of it; but to\r\neat nothing else but this everlasting lobster, lobster, lobster, is more\r\nthan I can stand.”\r\n\r\n“Tea last night,” said Tom Crawford, dolefully, “lobster. Breakfast this\r\nmorning, lobster. During the morning I felt hollow--lobster. At dinner,\r\nlobster. For my part, I’ve had enough of it.”\r\n\r\n“What can we do?”\r\n\r\n“I’m tired of shrimps.”\r\n\r\n“Bother shrimps.”\r\n\r\n“O for a good slice of bread and butter!”\r\n\r\n“Or a good mealy potato!”\r\n\r\n“Or a beefsteak!”\r\n\r\n“Or crackers and cheese!”\r\n\r\n“What are we going to do? We’ll have to eat lobster, or starve.”\r\n\r\n“I feel,” said Phil, “that I’m growing to be a lobster myself; my skin\r\nis turning quite hard.”\r\n\r\n“I’m beginning to lose faith in desert islands,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Yes,--they’re a failure.”\r\n\r\n“But how do we know?” said Bart. “We haven’t explored yet. We don’t know\r\nhalf of what may be on the island.”\r\n\r\n“We know pretty well what there is,” said Bruce. “Spruce trees, maple\r\ntrees, moss, and rocks,--that’s about all.”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, it isn’t a South Sea island, and so we can’t expect to\r\npull cocoa-nuts from the trees, or have bread-fruit for our breakfasts.\r\nThere are no mangoes, no bananas, no oranges, no grapes, no nothing,\r\nunless we choose to eat bark and fir cones.”\r\n\r\n“The next time we try a desert island, boys, I move that we make tracks\r\nfor the Pacific Ocean,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“I second that motion,” cried Phil.\r\n\r\n“It’s rather odd,” said Bart, “that all of us should get tired of\r\nlobster at the same time.”\r\n\r\n“It would be odder yet,” said Tom, “if any of us had been able to stand\r\nit any longer.”\r\n\r\n“That’s about the thing,” said Bruce. “And so the question remains yet,”\r\n said Arthur, “What are we going to do?”\r\n\r\nNo one answered. They all sat looking at the fire. Phil seized some\r\nbrush and flung it on; the flames caught it, and crackled through it,\r\nand dashed up fiercely and brightly, lighting up five very hungry, very\r\ntired, and very discontented faces.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Bart at last, starting to his feet. “Hurrah! I have it!”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Gulls’ eggs!” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Not bad,” said Bruce. “At any rate we can try it. Perhaps we may find\r\nsome young gulls. They eat young rooks in England; why shouldn’t young\r\ngulls be good?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll try it to-morrow,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Bart, “it all comes to this. We must explore the\r\nisland. I’ve got my pistol. Who knows what may turn up. We may come\r\nacross lots of rabbits, or, at any rate, wild fowl. Come, now, things\r\nare not so bad after all. Tomorrow will show us what the chances are\r\nfor our dinner table.”\r\n\r\nThis was now the only consolation they had. The lobsters had grown\r\nabhorrent, and they could not think of touching them any more. Hungry as\r\nthey were after all their hard work, they threw aside the only food that\r\nthey could get. They were compelled to go supperless to bed, and there\r\ndream of more agreeable food. Fortunately, though they could not eat,\r\nthey could sleep; and soon all were wandering far away in the land of\r\nNod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n_Exploring.--A wild Walk.--On the Lookout for Prey.--What is it?--Is\r\nit a wild Goose?--Tremendous Sensation, the Explorers being as much\r\nastounded as Robinson Crusoe was when he discovered the human Footprints\r\nin the Sand._\r\n\r\n\r\nON the following morning, all were up by daybreak, and Bruce could\r\nthink of nothing but gulls’ eggs. In the desperate extremity of hunger\r\nto which they were reduced through their dislike to lobsters, they\r\ndetermined to make a search along the cliffs for nests. They walked\r\nalong, and at length came to a place where some nests had been built.\r\nThey found a large number of eggs here, and appropriated them all. On\r\ncooking them, they found them of a peculiar flavor, yet eatable, and\r\nthey congratulated themselves on their good luck.\r\n\r\nThey now determined to put into execution their cherished plan of\r\nexploring the island. One was to stay behind to attend to the signal,\r\nand lots were drawn to see who it would be. It fell on Phil, who at once\r\naccepted his task with great cheerfulness, and informed them that he\r\nwould make an omelet on a hot stone. In this pleasing occupation they\r\nleft him, and went into the woods.\r\n\r\nThey found the woods here precisely like those of the other island. Fir,\r\nand spruce, and maple grew densely together, and beneath all there was\r\na thick underbrush, with fallen trees, and ferns, and moss. Progress,\r\nunder such circumstances, was exceedingly difficult; but they knew that\r\nthe island was quite small, and so they kept on their way. The grounds\r\ncontinually ascended for a long distance, and this, of course, added\r\nsomewhat to the difficulty of the journey; but at last the ascent\r\nceased, and they knew that they were on the summit of the island.\r\nNothing could be seen, however. So thick was the forest, that it shut\r\nout all the view; nor was it of any use to climb a tree, ‘for all were\r\nof nearly equal size, and if they were to climb up as far as they could,\r\nthey would only find the view obstructed by the tops of trees growing\r\naround. So they kept on their way, and found the ground descending\r\ncontinuously in an easy slope. The wood was as dense as ever, and no\r\nliving thing appeared. They had started with vague ideas of meeting with\r\nhares or wild fowl, but thus far nothing had been visible except the\r\ngulls overhead. They began to think that there was nothing but gulls\r\non the island. Bart, however, assured them that they could not judge as\r\nyet, and expressed his unshaken confidence that he would start a rabbit\r\nbefore the day was done. He had his pistol in his belt, and he was\r\ndetermined to use it before going home, even if he had to shoot a gull.\r\nSo they kept on down the descent, expecting every moment to come in\r\nsight of the bay.\r\n\r\nAt last the woods grew thinner, and before them they saw the sky through\r\nthe trees. Moving farther forward, the trees grew more scattered, and\r\nin a short time they found themselves at the top of a long, open ground,\r\nwhich sloped to the bay, and was overgrown with moss and low brushwood.\r\nAt the farther end of the open, a small eminence arose, with some bushes\r\non the summit. Before them the waters of the bay spread out, with the\r\ndistant horizon skirted by a range of hills.\r\n\r\n“Here’s the place for rabbits,” said Bart, “if there are any.”\r\n\r\n“If there are any! Of course,” said Bruce; “that’s the point.”\r\n\r\nThey walked on through the brush-wood, and at length, reaching a mossy\r\nknoll, they sat down to rest. After a time, Bart started off alone to\r\npursue his investigations. He had not gone far before he stopped, and\r\nshrunk back. Then he looked around with a triumphant expression. Then he\r\nmoved forward in a stealthy manner.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what’s up now,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Bart’s found something at last,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“A hare, perhaps,” said Tom.\r\n\r\nThe three boys started after Bart. Scarcely had they moved a half dozen\r\npaces, when Bart took aim and fired. A loud cry was heard, a large white\r\nbird was seen jumping in the air, and falling to the ground, and then\r\nBart ran forward and secured his prize.\r\n\r\nThe other boys hurried up to him. As they came, he turned to meet them,\r\nwith a face flushed with triumph, and holding the large white bird by\r\nthe legs.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” they cried.\r\n\r\n“A wild goose,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“A wild goose!” cried Bruce, who had reached him by that time. “A tame\r\none you mean.”\r\n\r\n“No it isn’t, either. How can it be a tame one? It’s a wild one.”\r\n\r\n“No, Bart,” said Arthur, “it’s a tame goose--as tame as I am.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a tame goose yourself,” said Bart. “Do you call that a tame\r\ngoose? Why, it’s a wild one, of course. Look at its wings.”\r\n\r\n“What about its wings? They’re tame enough. No, Bart, it’s the real\r\noriginal domestic goose of the civilized farm-yard.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! as though I don’t know a tame goose when I see one.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see one now.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“This is one.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“It is.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!”\r\n\r\n“Bart,” said Bruce, “did you ever see a live wild goose?”\r\n\r\n“No, I never did.”\r\n\r\n“Aha! How do you know anything about them, then?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I’ve seen pictures,--lots of thorn,--and they look just like\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve seen wild geese living and flying,--and dead, too, lots\r\nof times,--and this isn’t one.”\r\n\r\n“O, this is a kind that you are not acquainted with. Why, there are ever\r\nso many kinds of wild geese.”\r\n\r\nBut at this moment the boys were rudely interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Aha! ye thafes of the wurruld, ye!” cried a loud voice close\r\nbeside them. “Ye villains, ye. What are ye doin’,--a murdherin’ and\r\nslaughterin’ a poor man’s property. Ye blackgyards, ye! What d’ye mane\r\nby comin’ here and shootin’ my geese?”\r\n\r\nThunderstruck at this unexpected interruption, the boys turned, and\r\nfound themselves face to face with an old, grizzled, red-faced little\r\nIrishman, whose furious gestures and angry eyes were directed menacingly\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\n“Which af ye’s shot my goose?” he roared.\r\n\r\n“1 did,” said Bart, quietly.\r\n\r\n“Ye young villain! I’ll make ye pay for it,--and dear, too,--as sure as\r\nme name’s Denny O’Rafferty. What’r ye’s doin’ here, any how? What d’ye\r\nmane by shootin’ my goose? D’ye think I’m goin’ to be robbed be a gang\r\nof black-gyards? Be the powers! if ye think that same, ye’ll find ye’re\r\nmistaken, bad scran till ye!”\r\n\r\n“Mr. O’Rafferty,” said Bart, “you’re quite mistaken. We’re honest boys,\r\nand came here by accident.”\r\n\r\n“What did ye shoot the goose for, then, ye imp of mischief?”\r\n\r\n“It was a mistake,” said Bart, coolly. “Of course I didn’t know it was\r\nyours,--in fact, I wasn’t aware that anybody was living here. I will\r\nbe happy to pay you whatever you think it’s worth,-and am sorry for the\r\nmistake.”\r\n\r\nAt this speech O’Rafferty’s face and manner underwent a complete change.\r\n\r\n“Ach, be the powers! if that’s all,” said he, good humoredly, “then we\r\nwon’t say any more about it. But how did ye’s get here? I didn’t see any\r\nboat. Where did ye land, then?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the fact is, we were brought here,” said Bart, who went on to tell\r\nhim all about their adventure.\r\n\r\nDennis O’Rafferty listened to every word with intense interest, his face\r\nundergoing a perpetual change of expression, that spoke of conflicting\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\n“Be the powers, then,” he exclaimed, as Bart ceased, “it was a narrow\r\nscratch that ye had of it. An’ ye’ve been ashore here two nights. Be\r\njabers, it’s meself that’s ashamed of what I said till ye about the\r\ngoose. Have ye’s had anything till ate thin, at all?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing but lobster.”\r\n\r\n“Lobster! Well, thin, let me inforrum ye’s that ye’ll find that a\r\nmoighty onwholesome diet. An’ you’ve been here all that time wid nothin’\r\nat all to ate. Be jabers, I’m the boy for ye’s. Come along, boys. Ye’ll\r\nfind old O’Rafferty can give ye a breakfast, at any rate. Come along.\r\nYe’re starvin’, so ye are. Me old woman ‘ll be deloighted to set eyes on\r\nye’s. Never mind the goose; I’ll give ye’s a dozen for nothin’. Lave\r\nit lie there; the old woman ’ll come an’ pick it for ye. Come along,\r\nboys.”\r\n\r\nAnd the old fellow led the way; while the boys, delighted at the turn\r\nwhich things had taken, followed gayly after.\r\n\r\n“And so ye’r Docthor Porther’s boys, are ye’s?” continued Dennis.\r\n“Faith it’s himself ’ll be throubled. It’s a long time I’ve knowed\r\nthe docthor. An’ there isn’t his shuparior in the counthry. Arrah, be me\r\nsowl, but it’s meself that’s glad to see ye’s. The sight of yer young,\r\nfresh faces does good till me old bones. Come along, boys. And is the\r\ndocthor with ye’s in the schooner? Come along; ye haven’t fur to go.\r\nI’ve got a bit of a house around beyant. Ye’ll see it as soon as iver we\r\nturrun the hill.”\r\n\r\nOn rounding the hill, they saw a clearing of about thirty acres, with a\r\nboat drawn up on the shore, while close by them was a small house and\r\na barn. An old woman at the door looked up at them in speechless\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n“It’s the owld woman,” said O’Rafferty. “It’s herself that’s dead bate\r\nat the sight of ye’s.”\r\n\r\n“Lard save us, Dinny, what in the wurruld have ye got there, thin?”\r\n cried the old woman, as the party reached the house.\r\n\r\n“It’s some of Docthor Porther’s boys, that’s been gettin’ themselves\r\nshipwracked on the other side,” said O’Rafferty, “and haven’t had a bite\r\nto ate for two days, savin’ an’ exceptin’ a bit of cowld lobster, which\r\nisn’t aisy aitin’. An’ however they got ashore on there, widout oars,\r\nbates me intirely,--widout countin’ that thim same has been workin’ like\r\nslaves a day or more, on impty stomachs, buildin’ a camp and carryin’\r\nfire-wood, which is hard enough work to kill a man, let alone boys like\r\nthese. And so stir yer stumps, Molly avick, and bring out praties an’\r\nbacon, the best ye have, and a drawin’ of tay, an’ chayse, an’ bread\r\nand butter. It’s starvin’ they all are intoirely, or me name’s not Dinny\r\nO’Rafferty.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, thin,” cried the old woman, “the saints stand betune us and harrum.\r\nWhat’s that ye’r sayin’, Dinny O’Rafferty? Is it shipwracked ye wer’,\r\nthin, ye darlin’s of the wurruld? Sure it’s not much an owld woman like\r\nme can do for the likes of ye; but I’ll give ye the best I’ve got, so I\r\nwill. Sure an’.it’s starvin’ ye must be, if ye’ve had nothin’ to ate for\r\nso long.”\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the kindness and warmth of welcome which O’Rafferty\r\nand his wife gave the boys. The old woman bustled about, and kindled a\r\nfire, and put on the pot and kettle, and laid the table, occasionally\r\nstopping to look at the boys, one after the other, with a peculiar\r\nfondness of expression and a low, crooning noise, such as nurses make\r\nover children.\r\n\r\n“Sure it’s like a breath of fresh air to a captive in a dungeon to look\r\nat your swate faces,” she cried. “Niver a boy’s face have I seen since\r\nthe dark day when my own boy took his swate face from me eyes foriver.\r\nAn’ that was fifteen year ago. An’ we came here, an’ lived here ever\r\nsince.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman gave a long sigh, and sitting down, she held her head in\r\nher hands, rocking herself to and fro.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well,” she said, getting up and going out to the barn, “it’s not\r\nmuch longer to live we have thin.”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen years,” said O’Raflerty, as his wife went out. “It’s fifteen\r\nyears since we lost the boy. We lived in Parrsboro, an’ had as nice a\r\nhouse and farm as the likes of us could ever wish for. But whin we lost\r\nhim, we lost all heart for the place. The old woman wud have died if she\r\nhad staid; an’ so I bought this bit of a place, an’ what with farmin’\r\nan’ fishin’ we manage to grub along, though it’s seldom or niver that we\r\nsee anybody but our own two selves. Well, well; wud ye like to look at\r\nthe place?” he continued, rising. “It isn’t much of a place; but it’s\r\nnot long we have to live, and it’ll do for us.”\r\n\r\nThey followed the old man about. The place extended over thirty acres,\r\nwith a nice beach in front for the boat. It was an easy declivity, with\r\npasture lands behind the house. The boat was a large whaler, and nets\r\nwere spread on the grass to dry. O’Rafferty said that during the summer\r\nhe had visits sometimes from old friends, and at other times people\r\nlanded to see about the chances for sporting or getting minerals; but\r\nnever, since he had been there, had a boy been on shore, and his wife\r\nhad not seen a boy since she lost her son. He took them all over the\r\nplace, and finally led them to a little enclosure, not far from the\r\nhouse. Inside was a grave mound, and at the head a white wooden slab,\r\nwith these words painted upon it:\r\n\r\n                        In Memoriam.\r\n\r\n                   Michael O’Rafferty,\r\n\r\n                        beloved son of\r\n\r\n               Dennis and Mary O’Rafferty,\r\n\r\n                   born Aug. 2, 1830,\r\n\r\n                   died June 5, 1845.\r\n\r\n                   Requiescat in Pace.\r\n\r\nThe old man stood in silence, bareheaded, looking at the inscription.\r\nThe boys removed their hats, and looked in solemn sympathy at the\r\nbereaved father, whose love and yearning for his lost boy were still\r\nso manifest, that the sight of a boy’s face could renew his grief after\r\nfifteen vanished years. Standing thus in silence, and reverencing that\r\ngrief, they waited till the old man turned away, and then followed him,\r\nwithout a word, back across the field, and into the house.\r\n\r\nAs they entered, the savory smell of broiled bacon came gratefully to\r\ntheir nostrils. The table was spread with delicious mealy potatoes,\r\nbrown crusty bread, butter as yellow as gold, and clean, spotless\r\nplates.. If they had the power of wishing and gaining, they would have\r\ndesired nothing better than this.\r\n\r\n“Mr. O’Rafferty,” said Bart, suddenly, “I forgot to mention that\r\nwe left one of our number on the beach. I will take a run across the\r\nisland, with your permission, and bring him here, for he is as hungry as\r\nwe are, if not more so.”\r\n\r\n“Another one!” cried O’Rafferty. “An’ waitin’ on the beach! Why didn’t\r\nye tell me before?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see we were tired with our scramble, and I wanted to get\r\nrested before starting back. But I’ll go now, if you’ve no objection.”\r\n\r\n“Deed, thin, an’ I have an objection,” cried O’Rafferty. “D’ye think I’d\r\nlet ye go starvin’ back agin before ye’d got a bite to ate? or, for that\r\nmatter, d’ye think I’d let ye go at all? No; I’ll go meself.”\r\n\r\n“You? O, no. I won’t allow that,” began Bart. “It’s meself ‘ll go, an’\r\nnobody else,” cried O’Rafferty, positively. “Ye’r all too hungry an’\r\ntired. Besides, ye don’t know a step of the way. Ye came through\r\nthe woods, an’ a mighty tough job ye found it; but I know an aisier\r\nway--it’s a path of me own. Ye said it was at the other end of the\r\nisland, on the other side.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; at a rock with a tree on the edge.”\r\n\r\n“I know the place well. My path comes out close by there. I wonder ye\r\ndidn’t come across it.”\r\n\r\n“It is a wonder. We certainly would have noticed anything like a path,\r\nif we had found one.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s all the same now. Ye’ll jist stay here, an’ sit down an’ ate\r\nyer breakfasts like Christians, an’ I’ll go an’ bring the boy. Not one\r\nof ye shall stir a step--not one step.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. O’Rafferty, I’m sure you are putting yourself to too much\r\ntrouble--”\r\n\r\n“Throuble! D’ye call it throuble? Sure an’ isn’t it the brightest day\r\nI’ve knowed for iver so long?”\r\n\r\n“Deed it is,” chimed in his wife. “Be off wid ye, Dinny dear, and hurry\r\nback with the poor boy. Sure I’ll keep the tay hot for him, an’ the\r\npraties, an’ the bacon.”\r\n\r\nAny further remonstrance or objection was out of the question; so\r\nthe boys took their seats at the table. The old man started off, and\r\npromised to be back in a “jiffy.”\r\n\r\nHe ascended the slope behind the house, and entered the woods by a\r\npathway which, though but little trodden, was yet easy to traverse. Far\r\ndifferent was this from the rough way by which the boys had crossed the\r\nisland; and in far less time than they had taken, Denny approached the\r\nother shore. The pathway led down to the beach, about a hundred yards\r\nbelow the place where they had built their first fire.\r\n\r\nAs he descended, a singular sight met his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n_New Attempts at Cookery.--Phil on the Lookout.--A Sail! A Sail!--The\r\nSignal of the red Shirt.--The Home of the O’Raffertys._\r\n\r\n\r\nWE left Phil behind, on the beach.\r\n\r\nAfter the others had departed, Phil occupied himself with making\r\narrangements to while away the time. First of all, he set to work to try\r\nand make an omelet. After a long search on the beach, he found some clam\r\nshells, which he took up to the platform; and then, selecting some flat\r\nstones, he threw them into the fire. Then he mixed some eggs in one of\r\nthe shells, and tried to beat them with his jackknife. His success was\r\nnot exactly dazzling; but he was satisfied to a certain extent, and\r\nintensely interested. At length, drawing forth one of the stones, which,\r\nby this time, was red hot, he poured the mixture on its surface. There\r\nwas a fizzle, a steam, a hiss, and then a horrible smell of burnt egg.\r\nPhil made an awful face, and giving the stone a kick, sent it flying\r\ndown to the beach, omelet and all.\r\n\r\nNot at all discouraged, he began again _ab ovo_. Drawing out another\r\nstone, he determined to give it time to cool. So he mixed up some more\r\neggs in the shell; and after waiting patiently for a long time for the\r\nstone, he at length thought it was cool enough, and poured the mixture\r\nupon it. It certainly had grown cool this time in fact, somewhat too\r\ncool, as Phil gradually learned, when, after waiting patiently, he found\r\nthat there was no appearance of any progress whatever in the cookery.\r\nSo this, too, was a failure, and Phil disdainfully hurled it after its\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nBut he was not discouraged even yet. Once more he took his shell and\r\nmade another mixture, and then drew forth the stone, and carefully\r\nwatched it, trying it from time to time with the tip of his finger, to\r\nsee if it was of the proper temperature. Having singed the tips of all\r\nhis fingers, he concluded that it was time to stop that mode of testing,\r\nand run the risk of an actual trial. So he once more poured the mixture\r\non the stone. Aha! this time there was no mistake. A pleasant steam\r\ncame up, which was grateful to a famished boy. The only trouble was,\r\nthe lower part was done before the upper was in the least affected; and\r\nworse still, it began to burn while the upper part was raw. Phil was\r\nnot yet disheartened, however; and drawing his knife, he made desperate\r\nefforts to insert it under the omelet, so as to turn it over. But these\r\nefforts were not successful. He only succeeded in intermixing all\r\ntogether in a mess, and mangling it into a general mush. In trying to\r\ntaste some of it, he found in his mouth nothing but a very unpleasant\r\nmixture of raw and burnt egg. With a sigh he relinquished his\r\nexperiments, and sent this stone after the others.\r\n\r\nHe now contented himself with roasting two of them; and having partaken\r\nof them, he sauntered up the hill to the signal station. Here he lay\r\ndown, and looked lazily out at the water.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he done so, than he gave a start. An object was before his\r\neyes which he had not been able to see from the platform. The other end\r\nof the island could not be seen from there, because a projecting bank\r\nshut it out from view; but from here there was a fair view of the other\r\nislands. And there, just coming out from behind Pinnacle Island, was a\r\nschooner of the size and rig of the Antelope, and he did not doubt for\r\na moment but that it was their schooner. She was now sailing along, and\r\nwas not far from that very anchorage where he had seen her last.\r\n\r\nWith a shout and a wild beating of his heart, he sprang to his feet, and\r\nstared, with eager eyes, upon the schooner.\r\n\r\nShe was coming on very well, with a good breeze, and was coming in his\r\ndirection. Would she continue on her course? If so, she would soon be\r\nthere. Would she turn aside, and pass through the channel that separated\r\nthe islands, or sail away to the main land opposite? The thought was\r\nintolerable. He had grown weary of desert life; he longed to leave the\r\nisland,--or, rather, he longed to get something to eat.\r\n\r\nSo he rushed away to the pile of brush, and lighting his matches,--a\r\nwhole card at a time,--he touched up the kindling wood, and in a few\r\nmoments the blaze was spreading through the mass of dry brush. Soon the\r\nflames rose high into the air, bearing with them vast volumes of black\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nWould they see that signal? They could not help seeing it. Would they\r\nunderstand it? Ah! that was another question. Still it came on in the\r\nsame direction, without showing any signs of turning either to the right\r\nhand or the left. And now it had passed the channel between the islands,\r\nand was coming along in a line with the beach below, and not more than\r\nhalf a mile out.\r\n\r\nThe brush fire was burning briskly, and could last for half an hour\r\nwithout replenishing; but something more was needed. What could he do?\r\nAt first he thought of running down to the beach and shouting. But then\r\nhe feared that he might not be seen on the beach, and that his voice\r\nmight not be heard. So that plan was rejected. One only remained, and\r\nthat was, to climb the signal-staff. In an instant all this had passed\r\nthrough his mind, and in another instant it was acted upon. He tore off\r\nhis red shirt, tied the sleeves together loosely, and hung it around his\r\nneck, and then, with wonderful agility, climbed the tree till he reached\r\nthe top. The stumps of the branches, which remained on the trunk of\r\nthe tree, formed a good foothold, and he was able to stand securely,\r\nclasping the tree with one arm, while with the other he took his shirt\r\nfrom around his neck, and waved it to and fro in the air. Below, and\r\nabout thirty feet on one side, the fire blazed; and there, fifty feet\r\nin the air, on that solitary tree, stood the boy, waving, wildly and\r\nincessantly, the brilliant scarlet cloth. He felt that he had done the\r\nbest, and if this would not attract attention, nothing would.\r\n\r\nAll this time the schooner came on, and at length came nearly opposite.\r\nPhil saw the crowd on board. He saw them staring and gesticulating. He\r\nwas recognized--he was safe! Yes, there was Mr. Long,--he knew that tall\r\nfigure in black,--and he was going to the stern. What for? Aha! wasn’t\r\nthat glorious? He had gone and had seized the ropes, and lowered and\r\nhoisted the flag again a score of times. Ha, ha, ha! What flag? What\r\nflag? Why, their own flag,--the flag of the “B. O. W. C.,”--which had’\r\nevidently been waving there ever since their departure, and now saluted\r\nthem as it brought them safety.\r\n\r\nPhil’s merry laughter rang out loud and clear, as he saw all this, in\r\nhis excitement and his joy. He saw the schooner head in straight toward\r\nthe shore, then sweep round; and then down rattled her anchor, her sails\r\nfell, and she lay waiting.\r\n\r\nPhil gave a final wave and a loud, shout; and then, descending the tree,\r\nhe scampered down the slope and along the beach, as fast as his little\r\nlegs would carry him, until at last he reached the verge of the shore\r\nopposite the schooner. Here he gave a loud hurrah. His shrill voice\r\nreached the schooner, which was only a short distance off, and was\r\nresponded to by a loud cheer from all on board.\r\n\r\n“Where are the other boys?” cried Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“In the woods; they’ll be here soon.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s the boat?”\r\n\r\n“Up there,” said Phil, pointing to where it lay.\r\n\r\n“We can’t get ashore. We’ve got no boat.”\r\n\r\n“When the tide gets up, and the boys come back, we can get the boat\r\nout,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“How are you all?” cried Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“Very well, but nearly starved.”\r\n\r\nInstantly Mr. Long disappeared into the cabin. Returning shortly, he had\r\na bundle in his hand, around which a string was tied. Then taking one\r\nend of the string, and whirling it violently around, sling fashion, he\r\nhurled it through the air toward the shore. The parcel fell about twenty\r\nfeet beyond Phil. He ran to it, and, on opening it, found a quantity of\r\nsandwiches.\r\n\r\nThe ravenous way in which he devoured the sandwiches showed to those on\r\nboard, far more powerfully than words, how famished poor Phil must have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\n“Will the others be back soon?” asked Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“O, yes. They’ve gone across the island to explore.”\r\n\r\n“Were you able to sleep?”\r\n\r\n“Sleep? O, yes, first rate.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“In the camp up there,” said Phil, with his mouth full of sandwich,\r\nwaving his hand in the direction of the platform. “We’d have enjoyed it\r\nif we’d only had some sandwiches,” he added after a time, as he made a\r\nfresh onslaught on the parcel.\r\n\r\nIt was now about eleven o’clock, and not quite half tide. The tide was\r\nrising, however, and in due time would be up to the boat; and then, if\r\nthe boys did not come, they might get in near enough to throw Phil a\r\nline, and from the schooner pul the boat into the water. For the present\r\nit was necessary to wait; so Phil ate his sandwiches, and talked with\r\nthose on board. And this was the scene which met the eyes of Dennis\r\nO’Rafferty as he descended to the beach.\r\n\r\nDennis soon understood it all. Ge saw that the schooner had been\r\nsearching for the boys, and had come here in their absence, and had\r\nfound this boy. He hurried, without delay, to the beach, and at once\r\ntold Phil where his friends were, and explained to those on board the\r\nschooner what they were doing, and why he had come.\r\n\r\n“An’ is the docthor on board?”\r\n\r\n“No; he didn’t come.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, thin it’s mesilf that’s sorry for that same,” said Dennis.\r\n\r\nOn understanding the difficulty about the boat, he at once set himself\r\nto work remedying it. He found the rollers which the boys had used, and\r\nthe poles; and then, with Phil’s assistance, he began to push her down\r\ntoward the water. It was far easier pushing her down than it had been\r\npulling her up, and the boat soon reached the water’s edge.\r\n\r\n“We lost our oar, and we were making another. I don’t know whether you\r\ncan use it or not,” said Phil. “Wait here, and I’ll go and get it.”\r\n\r\nOn bringing it, Dennis found it quite rough, of course, but still\r\ncapable of working the boat along. So he launched the boat, and Phil\r\njumped in, and Dennis followed; and in a short time the boat touched\r\nthe vessel’s side. The current just here was not strong, for it was half\r\ntide, and the vessel was very close to the shore. Phil was dragged\r\non board by a dozen hands, and nearly suffocated by their rapturous\r\ngreetings.\r\n\r\nMr. O’Rafferty then explained again where the other boys were, and\r\ninvited all on board to come to his house and meet them. His invitation\r\nwas eagerly complied with. Another oar was found on board, and soon\r\nMessrs. Simmons and Long, with all the boys, were on the beach.\r\n\r\nThen they started. Phil insisted on showing the camp and the signal\r\nstation, and told them all about their experience in shell-fish and\r\nlobsters.\r\n\r\nThen they followed O’Rafferty across the island to his house.\r\n\r\nOn the way, Mr. Long told Phil all about the dismal voyage of the\r\nschooner after them. After cruising all about the Basin of Minas on the\r\nprevious day, they had decided to come back to the Five Islands, and\r\nsearch along the shores, with the hope of finding them, or at least\r\nsome traces of them. They had been watching the shore of this island so\r\nclosely, that they had seen the first flash of the fire on the signal\r\nstation. When they saw the red shirt by it, and then the figure climbing\r\nthe tree, they knew that their search was at last successful. He made\r\nPhil tell him, over and over again, all about his own eventful escape,\r\nand shuddered to think how extreme their peril had been.\r\n\r\nThe walk over O’Rafferty’s path was a most delightful one to all. The\r\nfearful cloud, that had so long hung over them, was at last dispelled,\r\nand in their reaction from sorrow, they all felt the wildest extreme of\r\njoy. So the boys went on with shouts, and songs, and laughter, till they\r\nreached their destination.\r\n\r\nThere the others had finished their repast, and were waiting for Phil.\r\nGreat was their amazement to see the crowd. At once all was explained.\r\nWith a wild cry of delight, they rushed to meet their friends, and their\r\nhands were nearly shaken off by their excited comrades.\r\n\r\nMr. O’Rafferty then left them, and Mrs. O’Rafferty prepared a repast for\r\nthe company. But first she set before Phil the good things that she had\r\nbeen saving for him; and, though that young gentleman had disposed of an\r\nimmense quantity of sandwiches, he yet was able--thanks to his\r\nexcellent appetite and vigorous constitution--to do full justice to Mrs.\r\nO’Rafferty’s tea and cream, and brown crusty bread and golden butter,\r\nand rich bacon, and mealy potatoes. Then the table was once more spread\r\nfor the other guests; and they found the repast an agreeable change from\r\nthe ship stores on which they had been feeding. To tell the truth, there\r\nwere many among the company who were as famished, and had eaten quite\r\nas little, during the last twenty or thirty hours, as the castaways\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThey then strolled about the fields and along the beach, till suddenly a\r\nshout from one of the boys attracted the attention of all.\r\n\r\nThere, coming round the point, was the familiar form of the Antelope,\r\nher boat towed behind her once more; Captain Corbet, the mate, and\r\nO’Rafferty on board, and the black flag of the “B. O. W. C.” floating\r\ngloriously aloft.\r\n\r\n“It’s been there all the time,” said Billymack. “Wasn’t it odd? Mr. Long\r\nwouldn’t let any one pull it down.”\r\n\r\n“And all the schooners laughed at us,” said Bogud. “It was such\r\nnonsense.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense?” said Bart. “Far from it, Bogud. There’s good luck in that\r\nemblem. So long as it floats on the breeze, we’ll turn out all right.”\r\n\r\n“If you call this good luck, I should like to know what bad luck is.”\r\n\r\nHere the anchor rattled, and all the boys ran to the beach.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for them to leave, O’Rafferty was in despair. He\r\nwanted them to stay at least one night. But Mr. Long could not. They had\r\nalready lost much time, and must make amends for it. They had to go that\r\nevening to Pratt’s Cove. So O’Raflerty consoled himself by extorting\r\na promise that the next time they came to the Five Islands they would\r\nanchor off his beach, and stop at least two days with him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the boys had a long debate as to what they could give to\r\nO’Raflerty. To offer money would be an insult. They had to select\r\nfrom among their possessions something that would be appropriate for\r\na parting gift. Bart proposed his pistol, but it was considered as not\r\nadapted to be of use to O’Rafferty. At last it was decided to give him\r\nthe hatchet. A hatchet would always be useful; and it was so pretty a\r\nlittle tool, that it would be in itself a graceful keepsake. So Bart,\r\nwith his jackknife, cut into the handle, very, neatly, the initials of\r\nthe different members of the “B. O. W. C.,” and handed the gift to the\r\nold man.\r\n\r\n“You won’t refuse it,” said Bart, “will you, Mr. O’Rafferty?” And he\r\nexplained the initial letters to him.\r\n\r\nTears started to the old man’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“It’s fairly heart-broken I am to part wid ye; but I’ll take the hatchet\r\nto remember yer sweet faces by, and wid the hope that you won’t forget\r\nowld O’Rafferty. And many’s the drame I’ll be draimin’ about yes, till\r\nme owld eyes gets a look at yes again.”\r\n\r\n“An’ may the blessin’s av Heaven go wid yes all, ye darlin’s av the\r\nworruld,” ejaculated the old woman. “It’s meself that’ll pray for yes,\r\nthat the Lard ‘ll stan’ betune yes and harrum. I’ll be lookin’ out for\r\nyes all another year, jewels; an’ I’ll have such crame, chayse, an’\r\nsuch maily taters, as ye never saw the like of before.”\r\n\r\nThe old couple wrung the hands of all of them, and watched them embark.\r\nSoon all were on board. Then the anchor went up, and up went the sails.\r\nThe schooner started, and moved slowly away.\r\n\r\nAnd as she moved away, the boys saw the old couple standing on the beach\r\nwaving farewells. There they stood till the vessel rounded a promontory\r\nwhich shut them from sight.\r\n\r\nThey were on their way to Pratt’s Cove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n_Pratt’s Cove.--A Dinner Party.--The faithless Cook and\r\nSteward.--Songs.--Sudden and startling Interruption.--Stealing a\r\nWood-pile.--Overwhelming Piece of Intelligence._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE wind and tide were both, rather unfavorable, and it was late before\r\nthey reached Pratt’s Cove. This place is formed by the bed of a creek\r\nwhich runs up from the bay, and, like all the streams of these waters,\r\nis subject to very great variations, being fordable at low tide, but\r\nat high tide deep enough to float a ship. It was half tide when they\r\narrived, and the schooner was able to run a little way up the stream,\r\nwhere she anchored. It was quite dark, but they could see that the\r\nnearest land was a projecting point, clear of trees, and promising\r\na pleasanter camping-ground than the hold of the schooner. It was\r\ntherefore unanimously decided to go ashore, kindle a fire, and pass as\r\nfestive an evening as possible. The shore was close by, and in a very\r\nshort time they were all out of the vessel. Plenty of fuel lay there in\r\nthe shape of a long pile of dry birch wood which lay heaped up along\r\nthe shore. To this they helped themselves, kindled an enormous fire, and\r\nwere soon seated around it, waiting for their evening repast.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the trip, Johnny Blue and Sammy Ram\r\n\r\nRam had been appointed steward and cook, owing to their personal\r\napplication for those very honorable offices. Their duties had been very\r\nlight; in fact, partly on account of rough weather, and partly owing\r\nto the anxiety of the previous day, there had been little or no occasion\r\nfor their services. It was therefore expected that on the present\r\noccasion they would surpass themselves and astonish everybody by the\r\nbrilliancy of their performance. As the party sat round the fire waiting\r\nfor their repast, they all anticipated something of extraordinary\r\nexcellence, and were impatient for the banquet to begin. Sammy and\r\nJohnny Blue, however, made no very great haste. In fact, it seemed to\r\nsome that they were astonishingly slow, if not reluctant. Slowly they\r\nturned over the things, slowly they opened and shut the boxes and\r\nbaskets, and very slowly indeed they took out the dishes.\r\n\r\n“See here, you fellows,” cried Bruce, suddenly. “You don’t appear to be\r\naware of the fact that we’re all starving.”\r\n\r\n“Hurry up your cakes!” cried another.\r\n\r\n“Come, be quick about it, Sammy Ram Ram! What’s the use of being so\r\nparticular?”\r\n\r\n“Tumble out the things any way! We don’t want a regular set table.”\r\n\r\nSammy and Johnny quickened their motions a little, and said they would\r\nbe ready “in a minute.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Messrs. Simmons and Long, assisted by the devoted Bogud,\r\nhad been sorting their minerals’ in a general way, and wrapping each\r\nspecimen in paper. Two good-sized baskets were filled, and many of them\r\nwere very fine indeed. There were some fern prints, and some tracks of\r\nbirds on sandstone, which Mr. Long had found, and which he regarded with\r\nthe tenderest admiration. There was a very excellent amethyst, found by\r\nMr. Simmons, some mica, some barytes, and, above all, a piece of quartz,\r\nin which faint flecks of gold were visible. It was taken from a vein\r\nwhich ran up the cliff, and was a foot or more in thickness. It seemed\r\nto promise a rich gold harvest to any one who might choose to try\r\ngold-crushing in so remote a place.\r\n\r\nThe tender interest excited by all these treasures, and the occupation\r\nof putting them into separate baskets, had so fully engrossed their\r\nthoughts, that they had not noticed any particular delay. At last,\r\nhowever, the work was done; and then it was that Mr. Long thought about\r\nthe claims of appetite.\r\n\r\nHe started to his feet.\r\n\r\n“What!” he cried, as he looked around; “not ready yet? Why, what’s the\r\nmatter?”\r\n\r\n“In a minute,” said Sammy Ram Ram.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes--in a minute,” chimed in Johnny Blue.\r\n\r\n“A minute? Well, that’s longer than I can wait. So come along, all\r\nof us!” said Mr. Long, advancing to the place where a cloth had been\r\nspread. The rest all followed.\r\n\r\nThere was a very meagre repast--in fact, but the beginning of a\r\nrepast--before them.\r\n\r\n“Come, hurry up!” said Mr. Long, as he and Mr. Simmons, followed by the\r\nrest, threw themselves on the grass around the table-cloth. “Fetch along\r\nsome of the turkey and chickens quick!” There was no response. Sammy and\r\nJohnny both stood looking excessively guilty.\r\n\r\n“Come, hurry up! We can’t eat ham and-biscuit. Why, what’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Why--there--there isn’t any,” stammered Sammy.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” cried Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“The turkey--it’s all gone, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Gone!” cried Mr. Long, in amazement. “What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nAnd twelve astonished faces confronted the cook and steward.\r\n\r\n“Why, sir,” said the cook, “you see we ate a good many before we\r\nstarted.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. There were eight turkeys eaten that evening and next\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“And fifteen chickens, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And ten mince pies,” added the steward, gathering courage at the sound\r\nof his own voice.\r\n\r\n“And all the cheese,” responded the cook. “And most of the tarts.”\r\n\r\n“And a good deal of the cake.”\r\n\r\n“And a good many of the ham sandwiches, and half of the eggs, and--”\r\n\r\n“And ever so much ginger beer.”\r\n\r\n“The boys were, eating, sir, steadily through the night.”\r\n\r\n“And through the next day, till they got sick, and couldn’t eat any\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\nTo this all present listened in the utmost astonishment, and without\r\nsaying a single word.\r\n\r\n“So we ate most of the things before we left--did we?” asked Mr. Long,\r\nwith a sour smile. “Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“How many turkeys did we leave with?”\r\n\r\n“Seven, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And how many chickens?”\r\n\r\n“Four, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And how many mince pies?”\r\n\r\n“Eight, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Have we eaten all these since?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jiggins, “all day yesterday I only ate one ham sandwich,\r\nand to-day only a turkey drumstick, except at O’Rafferty’s.”\r\n\r\n“I ate a mince pie yesterday,” said Billymack “and another one\r\nto-day--that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, I’m not inquiring into what you ate, boys,” said Mr. Long,\r\ngood-humoredly. “I was only amazed to find that our stores had gone so\r\nfast. We’ll have to live on clams, or go home, unless we can buy some\r\nprovisions here. Well, well,” he concluded, with a sigh, “we’ll have to\r\nattack this ham bone. Here, cook; isn’t there any more ham left?”\r\n\r\n“One more, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Any pie?”\r\n\r\n“A half of a mince pie, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Hm--well--we’ll have to wait till to-morrow--that’s all. It’s my own\r\nfault, I suppose. I didn’t make allowance for the appetites of growing\r\nboys.”\r\n\r\n“Especially of the cook and steward,” growled Bogud.\r\n\r\nThey had to bear with their disappointment as best they could. The cook\r\nand steward looked very meek and subdued, for though nothing was said,\r\nyet they felt that they were under a ban. The repast consisted of\r\nnothing but bread and butter, and ham, and cold water. But still, as\r\nthey all had excellent appetites, they ate with a relish what was before\r\nthem, and had no trouble, except about provisioning the ship for the\r\nfuture. It was tacitly understood, however, that Sammy Ram Ram and\r\nJohnny Blue should be henceforth relieved from these onerous and\r\nresponsible duties. The repast was at length finished, and Messrs.\r\nSimmons and Long went aside to take another look at their beloved\r\nspecimens, and speculate upon the probabilities of gold-mining at the\r\nFive Islands. The others sat round the fire. Captain Corbet sat, with\r\na patriarchal smile, surveying the young faces around him. The mate sat\r\namong a crowd of noisy lads, who were trying to draw him out.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, in continuation of some statement which he was making,\r\n“it’s true. I’m tellin’--”\r\n\r\n“And that’s your name--is it?” asked Billymack.\r\n\r\n“My name’s Wade,” said the mate, “an’ my old ’oman’s name’s Gipson;\r\nand ye’ll not find many of that name in this counthry. No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“But how can your name be Wade, and your old ’oman’s name be Gipson?”\r\n\r\n“How? because my name _is_ Wade, and me old ’oman’s name _is_\r\nGipson.”\r\n\r\n“But she’s your wife--ain’t she?”\r\n\r\n“My own wife--married be me brother the praste.”\r\n\r\n“Then she must be Mrs. Wade.”\r\n\r\n“I tell ye her name’s Gipson.”\r\n\r\n“If she’s your wife, she must be named Wade.”\r\n\r\n“I tell ye _me_ name’s Wade, and me old ’oman’s name’s Gipson; an’\r\nye’ll not find many o’ that name in this counthry.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the mate prosed on, unable to see that his wife’s name was the\r\nsame as his own.\r\n\r\nAnd now fresh wood was heaped upon the fire. Some went off and gathered\r\nbrush, and the bright, flaring flame burst forth, rising far into the\r\nsky, and throwing a vivid light. Then they all sat round’ it, watching\r\nthe flames as they shot up and illuminated the scene, throwing a gleam\r\nof radiance across the water, and lighting up the old schooner as she\r\nlay afloat.\r\n\r\nThen a song was proposed. Captain Corbet opened the proceedings by one\r\nof his own peculiar harmonies, which was received with loud laughter and\r\ncheers. Others then, sang; and finally they called on Bart for “Bingo,”\r\n a favorite song with all. So Bart sang Bingo, and they all joined in the\r\nchorus.\r\n\r\n                   “A farmer’s dog sat on the floor,\r\n\r\n                        And his name was little Bingo;\r\n\r\n                   A farmer’s dog sat on the floor,\r\n\r\n                        And his name was little Bingo.\r\n\r\n               Bart. B!\r\n\r\n               Bruce. I!!\r\n\r\n               Arthur. Nil!\r\n\r\n               Tom. G!!!!\r\n\r\n               Omnes. O! O! O! O! O!\r\n\r\n                   ‘And his name was little Bingo!\r\n\r\n                   “This farmer he brewed right good ale,\r\n\r\n                        And called it rare old Stingo;\r\n\r\n                   This farmer he brewed right good ale,\r\n\r\n                        And called it rare old-Stingo.\r\n\r\n               Bart. S!\r\n\r\n               Bruce. T!!\r\n\r\n               Arthur. I!!!\r\n\r\n               Tom. N !!!!\r\n\r\n               Phil. G!!!!!\r\n\r\n               Omnes. O! O! O! O!

We think it is, by jingo!\r\n\r\n               Bart. O, don’t you call this a merry tale?\r\n\r\n               Omnes. We think it is, by jingo!\r\n\r\n               Bart.

O!\r\n\r\n                   “We think it is, by jingo!”\r\n\r\nAs the last chorus, roared out in tremendous tones, burst into the air\r\nand ceased, it was followed by a sudden roar of thundering laughter\r\ncoming from some strange voice from the direction of the wood-pile. In\r\nan instant every one had started to his feet, and looked in amazement\r\nfor the cause of the noise.\r\n\r\nThere, on the top of the wood-pile, stood a stout, burly, red-faced\r\nman, laughing, and stamping, and clapping his hands. It was a long\r\ntime before he could gain breath, to speak. At length he conquered his\r\nlaughter, and shaking his fist, he bawled out,--\r\n\r\n“See here, you young rascals! What do you mean by coming here and\r\nburning up my wood? Hey!”\r\n\r\nAt this Mr. Long came forward, and Captain Corbet followed. Mr. Long\r\nintroduced himself, explained the situation, apologized, and offered to\r\npay.\r\n\r\nThis the stranger laughingly listened to.\r\n\r\n“Pooh, pooh! Mr. Long. I’m delighted to see you, sir,” he said. “Don’t\r\napologize for the wood. You’re welcome to all of it. I’m Captain Pratt,\r\nand I want you to come up to my house, and put up there as long as\r\nyou like. As for the wood, I’ll give you free liberty to burn it, on\r\ncondition that the boys sing that song again.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Pratt now advanced among them, and his bluff manner, hearty\r\nlaughter, and stentorian voice at once made him a great favorite. He\r\ninformed them that he was the owner of the cove and all the region round\r\nabout; that he had a sawmill up the stream; that he had a schooner which\r\nwas away; and finally he insisted that they all should go at once to\r\nhis house, and take up their quarters there for as long a time as they\r\nliked.\r\n\r\nThis invitation was unanimously accepted, with thanks from the teachers\r\nand cheers from the boys. So, leaving Captain Corbet and the mate to\r\nextinguish the fire, to prevent danger to the wood-pile, they followed\r\nCaptain Pratt through the darkness to his house.\r\n\r\nIt was a small-sized farm-house, where Captain Pratt and his wife lived\r\nby themselves. He had three beds, into one of which he proposed to put\r\nMessrs. Simmons and Long, leaving the other beds and a huge kitchen\r\nsofa for the twelve boys. Captain Corbet and the mate could sleep on\r\nthe vessel. The boys succeeded in packing themselves away in some\r\nextraordinary fashion or other; and though they would have had far more\r\nreal comfort on board of the schooner, yet they preferred this for the\r\nnovelty of the thing.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the first care was to secure a supply of\r\nprovisions. Captain Pratt had a rude sort of shop, in which he kept\r\nsupplies for the mill, but unfortunately the stock was low; but the\r\nschooner was expected every day with fresh stores. All that the shop\r\ncontained, at present, was some meal and molasses, with a box of tobacco\r\nand a barrel of pork. Out of these they had to select the ship stores;\r\nand as they had only Hobson’s choice, they laid in some meal, molasses,\r\nand pork. Captain Corbet tried hard to induce them to lay in some\r\ntobacco also, but Mr. Long declined.\r\n\r\nStrolling about the cove, they found it a very pretty place, encircled\r\nby hills which were covered with hard-wood trees. A stream ran from\r\namong the hills into the creek, supplying it with a little fresh water,\r\nwhich at low tide was the only water in its bed. Going up the stream a\r\nshort distance, they came to a very romantic spot, where the stream ran\r\nthrough a narrow gorge, and tumbled over a small precipice, forming a\r\nminiature cascade of a very charming kind. Here the boys spent a greater\r\npart of the day in fishing, and succeeded, after six hours’ laborious\r\neffort and patient waiting on the part of ten of them, in catching five\r\nvery small trout.\r\n\r\nAfter getting the supplies for the schooner, Messrs. Simmons and Long\r\nwent along the shore to a place which Captain Corbet told them of, where\r\nthey expected to secure some petrifactions. Captain Corbet went with\r\nthem as guide. The mate took possession of the barn, and slept all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAs for the boys, two of them, Bogud and Billy-mack, went with the\r\nteachers by special invitation, for the others preferred remaining.\r\nSix hours were consumed in fishing, and the remainder of the time in\r\ndawdling. They _did_ Pratt’s Cove so thoroughly that there was not a\r\nnook unexplored.\r\n\r\nOn the following night, the “B. O. W. C.” decided to quit Captain\r\nPratt’s house and sleep in the schooner. So they went down about dusk,\r\nand were put on board by Jiggins, who brought back the boat to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Simmons and Long did not return that night, nor yet on the\r\nfollowing morning. About ten o’clock they got back. They were met by\r\nCaptain Pratt and the five boys who had slept at his house. They had\r\nvery serious faces.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Captain Pratt had been down at eight o’clock to call the\r\nboys to breakfast. He found the schooner gone, and on the mud flats,\r\nleft dry by the tide, lay the fluke of the anchor broken off short. This\r\nwas the message that he brought, explaining, at the same time, that the\r\nboys had slept on board, and must have drifted away with the schooner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n_On the Track again.--Fishing for a Duck.--Asking for Bread, and getting\r\nStones.--Pat shines as Cook._\r\n\r\n\r\nAT receiving such startling intelligence, both Messrs’. Simmons and\r\nLong looked horrified and bewildered, and neither of them said one word.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, the mate’s on board,” said Mr. Long at last.\r\n\r\n“The mate! That’s the wrorst of it. He got his breakfast only a half an\r\nhour go. He slept in my barn.”\r\n\r\n“And where has the vessel gone?” cried Mr. Long, in great distress.\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell. I rowed out for a mile, but didn’t see any signs of\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“We must go after them at once,” said Mr. Long. “Can’t we get a\r\nsail-boat somewhere?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I can rig up a sail in my boat; but she’s only a punt, and I\r\ndon’t think wo could manage her at all among the currents out there.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if they know anything about sailing?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt they do,” said Captain Pratt.\r\n\r\n“O, they’re all right,” said Captain Corbet, confidently. “I said, when\r\nthey went adrift before, that they’d turn up right side up--and up they\r\nturned. Besides, the weather’s fine, and there’s no danger in life.”\r\n\r\n“Still we must do something,” said Mr. Long, anxiously. “Even if they do\r\nunderstand sailing, they can never get back here again.”\r\n\r\n“It’s jest what I’ve been expectin’,” said Captain Corbet, after a\r\nprofound silence, and with a tone of deep conviction.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that there anchor.”\r\n\r\n“What did you expect?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that it would break off short. You see there’s been a crack in it\r\nfor nigh two years, an’ every time I used it, I said, says I, it’s bound\r\nto go this time.”\r\n\r\n“But why in Heaven’s name did you let it go so long, if it was cracked?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, to tell the truth, I never gave it a thought, ’cept when I had\r\noccasion to anchor,--and then, of course, I couldn’t get it mended.”\r\n\r\n“And so you’ve been trusting your own life, and the lives of other\r\npeople, to that old, cracked anchor,” cried Mr. Long, indignantly.\r\n\r\n“Wal, it held on well down thar at Five Islands, and off on the\r\nmud-flats. You know that. It did jest as well as a bran new one, and\r\ndidn’t break fair this time, nuther.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t break fair! What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I mean the schooner has kind o’ sot on it when she was aground,\r\nand broke it that way.”\r\n\r\nMr. Long turned away.\r\n\r\n“Captain Pratt,” said he, “I won’t conceal from you that I’m very\r\nanxious. Those boys may understand sailing, but I’m not sure that they\r\ndo. I must do something. Can’t you suggest anything?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I was just going to take my glass,” said Captain Pratt, “and go\r\ndown to that there pint,” pointing to a headland a few miles off. “That\r\npint commands a view of pooty nigh the whole bay, and I shouldn’t wonder\r\nif we’d see the schooner. I was just going there when you came. Besides,\r\nwe can get a boat down there,--a good deal better than mine.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll start off at once, then,” said Mr. Long. “These boys can wait\r\nhere till We come back. I hope we won’t need to trouble your good nature\r\nlong, Captain Pratt.”\r\n\r\n“Trouble! Why, sir, it’s the greatest pleasure I have to see a strange\r\nface here occasionally.” After a few words of warning and good advice to\r\nthe boys who were to remain, Mr. Long, together with Mr. Simmons, went\r\nwith Captain Pratt, while Captain Corbet, with Bogud and Billymack,\r\nfollowed after them. The party of six set out in the direction of the\r\nheadland mentioned by Captain Pratt, while the five boys who remained\r\nsauntered down slowly to the shore, where were the boxes and baskets\r\nwhich had been landed there on the evening of the arrival at the cove.\r\n\r\nThe boys felt the hours hang heavily upon their hands. The absence of\r\ntheir companions made them all feel dull; the fare at Captain Pratt’s\r\nhad grown distasteful, for pork and Indian meal and molasses are things\r\nthat are sometimes not wonderfully attractive to the youthful taste. So\r\nthese things palled; and when, at twelve o’clock, they were summoned\r\nto dinner by amiable Mrs. Pratt, she found that they had lost their\r\nappetites--a thing which she attributed to their grief about their lost\r\ncompanions; and so she set to work to condole with them and comfort\r\nthem. After escaping from this kind-hearted old lady, they went down to\r\nthe point again, and watched the water as it flowed in. Captain Pratt\r\nand his companions had not comeback, and they were prepared for a long\r\nabsence on his part. The thought made them more disconsolate.,\r\n\r\n“What can we do?” said Sammy.\r\n\r\n“We’ll starve,” said Johnny Blue.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to do something,” said Jiggins, who was a very grave, earnest\r\nboy, and always spoke in a very grave, earnest manner.\r\n\r\n“Well, what?”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Jiggins, “I’ll go fishing. Who’ll come with me?”\r\n\r\n“I will,” said Muckle.\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Johnny Blue.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think there’s any chance,” said Pat; “so I’ll stay here and\r\nfish for ails in the mud.”\r\n\r\nPat could never get rid of “a taste of the brogue,” which clung to him,\r\nand proclaimed his nationality.\r\n\r\nSammy showed no inclination to move; so the three went fishing, leaving\r\nhim and Pat behind.\r\n\r\nPat then went into the woods and cut a long fishing-pole, after which he\r\nwent fishing for “ails.” He had no success, but kept at it bravely for\r\nmore than an hour, unwilling to give up. At last his patience was worn\r\nout, and he returned to the point. On his arrival there, Sammy was not\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nPat seated himself disconsolately on the shore, and watched the tide,\r\nwhich was now running out, for some time. Then his roving eyes were\r\nattracted by the baskets and trunks. To these he directed his steps, in\r\nthe hope that something might be found there with which he could satisfy\r\nthe cravings of his appetite.\r\n\r\nHe found most of the trunks empty. Some of the baskets were filled with\r\nplates, others with cups and saucers, others with knives, forks, and\r\nspoons. All these excited his disgust to an unmeasured degree. In one\r\nof them he found a ham-bone, the remainder of their last repast on\r\nthe shore. This had nothing on it whatever--a fact which excited such\r\nindignation in Pat that he flung it into the water.\r\n\r\nAt last he came to the baskets containing the minerals. Opening these,\r\nhe found a large number of parcels inside. Hoping that these would\r\nafford something eatable, he opened one or two of them, but found, to\r\nhis unspeakable disgust, that they contained nothing but stones.\r\n\r\nPat was a very original character, who had drifted, by some\r\nextraordinary chance, into the school. With a very strong desire to get\r\nan “edication,” he had come there and begged Dr. Porter to admit him,\r\noffering to pay his way by working.-Dr. Porter found that the Irish boy\r\nhad already learned a good deal, and that he had an exceedingly strong\r\ndesire to be taught more. He could read and write well; and so earnest\r\nwere his entreaties, that the kind-hearted doctor consented to admit\r\nhim. His industry and application soon gained the good will of the\r\nteachers; while his flow of good spirits, his oddities and whims, made\r\nhim popular among the boys. In many respects he was intensely ignorant,\r\nand had not been long enough at the school to acquire anything like the\r\ngeneral information which the rest of the boys possessed. At first they\r\nhad wondered or laughed at his blunders; but afterward Pat had been\r\nmore cautious about expressing his opinions on anything, and thus,\r\nby exhibiting his ignorance less, was supposed to have surmounted it.\r\nTaking him all together, he was a very remarkable boy, and promised, in\r\ntime, to surpass many of his companions.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, he was far inferior to them all. He had been asked\r\nto go on the trip of the Antelope from a very kindly desire to give him\r\nall the advantages possible. He had not the remotest idea what the real\r\npurpose of the trip was, but supposed it to be a kind of pleasure party.\r\nIt is true he saw Messrs. Simmons and Long hammering, rocks; but with\r\nhis usual caution about committing himself and exposing his ignorance,\r\nhe had not asked anything about it, nor had he looked at their work.\r\nWhile they were hammering rocks, he was climbing them, or running about\r\nthe beach. He had not noticed the baskets, but supposed them to be full\r\nof provisions; nor had he seen Messrs. Simmons and Long in their tender\r\ntare of their specimens after landing on this place. The stones, then,\r\nwhich Pat discovered, wrapped in paper, were utterly unintelligible\r\nto him, and the sight of them only seemed to cap the climax of the\r\nindignation which was growing in his breast.\r\n\r\n“Well! well well!” he exclaimed, as he looked at each stone on taking it\r\nfrom the paper. “What’s this? A stone--a muddy stone! By the powers, but\r\nisn’t this like a boy askin’ for bread, and gettin’ a stone.”\r\n\r\nIn fact it was no better than a dirty stone in Pat’s eyes. Two very\r\nbeautiful specimens of moss agate they were; but it would need grinding\r\nand polishing to bring out these peculiar beauties. As yet they were\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\nAnother and another paper was opened. One contained a white stone, like\r\nquartz, enclosing some amethysts; another a piece of sandstone, with\r\npeculiar marks on it, very highly prized by Mr. Simmons. These Pat threw\r\non the ground with great indignation. Then he took the rest out without\r\nopening them, knowing by the touch and the weight of them what they\r\nwere. He had a strong hope that something eatable might yet be in the\r\nbottom of the basket; but at last all was empty, and there was nothing\r\nto eat.\r\n\r\nHis indignation could no longer be repressed. He had a vague idea that\r\nsome one had done this so as to play a trick on him, and this thought\r\nonly heightened his passion. So, without thinking of anything but his\r\nown wrongs, he seized the unoffending stones by handfuls, and angrily\r\nthrew them over the bank into the water. Then he sat down gloomily, and\r\ntried to conjecture which of the boys it had been who had wrapped all\r\nthose stones in paper for the sake of tricking him. At first his impulse\r\nwas to go around among them fiercely and inquire; but at length, from\r\nfear of being laughed at, he decided to say nothing about it, but wait\r\nand see what would turn up.\r\n\r\nHe was roused from his reverie by a touch on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe started hastily, and saw Johnny Blue, looking very mysterious, with\r\nsomething under his jacket.\r\n\r\n“Hallo! Where, are-the others?” said Pat. “Couldn’t you catch anything?”\r\n\r\n“The others are up the brook, fishing. I caught _something_,” said\r\nJohnny, with a more mysterious look than ever.\r\n\r\n“What is it? What, have you got under your arm?”\r\n\r\n“See,” said Johnny, triumphantly; and lifting his jacket, he displayed,\r\nto Pat’s astonished gaze, the form of a duck.\r\n\r\n“A duck!” cried Pat, with a shout. “Where did you get it?”\r\n\r\n“H-s-s-s-s-h!” said Johnny, warningly. “I caught it.”\r\n\r\n“Caught it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, with a fish-hook. I trailed the hook, baited with a bit of bread,\r\nand the duck bit--and here he is.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll cook him!” cried Pat.\r\n\r\n“That’s it; but we’d better get away where they won’t see us.”\r\n\r\n“Sure nobody ‘ll see us here, at all, at all.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t they?”\r\n\r\n“Surely no. There’s lots of wood here, an’ I’ll start the fire in a\r\njiffy. Come along. Hurroo, boys!”\r\n\r\nSo Pat and Johnny set the fire going, and then they picked the\r\nduck,---which was previously killed, of course,--and they had him all\r\nready to lay on the coals, when suddenly, their attention was arrested\r\nby a low, muffled, piteous squeal close by them behind the wood-pile.\r\n\r\n“H-s-s-s-s-h!” said Johnnie.\r\n\r\n“Botheration!” said Pat, hiding the duck under a log of wood.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” said Johnnie.\r\n\r\n“Sure it’s a pig--that’s what it is,” said Pat.\r\n\r\nA rustle was heard now in the bushes, and then Sammy walked out from\r\nbehind the wood-pile. His face had a bright expression of satisfaction,\r\nand he, too, had something under his arm.\r\n\r\n“It’s another duck!” said Pat, with a wild laugh.\r\n\r\n“Sammy’s been out fishin’, too,” and he went off into a peal of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n“Stop your noise,” said Sammy. “I thought you were somebody else, and\r\nthat’s why I had to come through the trees, and behind the wood-pile.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a duck ye’ve got, thin?” asked Pat. “Sure, haven’t we one\r\noursilves?”\r\n\r\nSammy said nothing, but drawing his jacket aside, showed the little\r\nwhite head and twinkling eyes of a pig of very small size--a roaster, in\r\nfact, in excellent condition.\r\n\r\n“It’s a pig ye’ve got. Didn’t I know the squale of it? Didn’t I say it\r\nwas? It’s me that knows the voice of a pig. Hurroo, boys! we’re goin’ to\r\nhave a banquet, so we are. Where did ye get it, thin, Sammy, jewel?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk so loud,” said Sammy, looking cautiously all around.\r\n“They’ll hear you.”\r\n\r\n“It’s mum I’ll be, thin. But where did ye get it, darlin’?” said Pat, in\r\na soft, coaxing whisper.\r\n\r\n“Up there.”\r\n\r\n“Where? Pratt’s?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Where thin?”\r\n\r\n“O, never mind. It wasn’t near any house. It was in a field. There were\r\na dozen of them; and I was so hungry I couldn’t help it.”\r\n\r\n“Faith, thin we may as well have the young roaster as the old pork,”\r\n said Pat. “Ye’re well here. We’re in luck this day. See here.”\r\n\r\nAnd he pulled out the duck and showed it to Sammy.\r\n\r\n“How nicely you’ve picked it and fixed it!” said he. “I wish we could\r\nmanage the pig. I don’t know what to do with it.”\r\n\r\n“Many’s the pig I’ve kilt,” said Pat, loftily.\r\n\r\n“Have you then? And will you do this one?”\r\n\r\n“Will I do it? Faith, it’s me that will,” said Pat. “But won’t he\r\nsqueal?”\r\n\r\n“Squale is it? Not a squale you’ll hear.”\r\n\r\nOn this Sammy handed the pig to Pat, who disappeared with it among the\r\nbushes. No sound was heard; but after a short absence Pat returned in\r\ntriumph, having accomplished his object.\r\n\r\n“And now we’ll have two roasts, instead of one.” Driving two forked\r\nsticks into the ground, he made another with a sharp point, and ran it\r\nthrough the duck and the pig; then he laid the stick with its burden\r\nupon the two forked sticks, and knelt down by the fire.\r\n\r\n“The coals are just right,” said Pat. “I’ll sit here an’ give it a\r\nturrun till I’m tired, an’ thin ye’ll relave me.” So he kept on turning\r\nthe spit, and soon a rich aromatic fragrance filled the air.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t there any salt?” asked Pat, after a time.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Johnny; “and there’s pepper too. I’ll get the\r\ncastors.”\r\n\r\n“Do, thin, and quick too,” said Pat.\r\n\r\nThe castors were soon forthcoming, and Pat sprinkled a little salt and\r\npepper over the roaster and the duck.\r\n\r\n“That’s the way,” said he, “to bring out the full fleevour.”\r\n\r\nAt length they were done, and taken off the fire. The plates, knives and\r\nforks, upon which Pat had looked so contemptuously shortly before, were\r\nnow brought forth. A pleasant place was found in a secluded spot, and\r\nhere they sat down to dine.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely begun when footsteps were heard. Pat went out to\r\nreconnoitre.\r\n\r\nIt was Jiggins and Muckle.\r\n\r\n“Have ye caught any fish?” was his first address to them.\r\n\r\n“No,” said they in a discontented tone; “and we’re starving.”\r\n\r\n“Is it starvin’ ye are? Thin will ye just step in here, for we’ve got\r\nthe most illegant dinner ye ever sot eyes on.” And saying this he led\r\nthem to the little secluded nook, where the table was spread on the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock they went up to tea, and Mrs. Pratt sympathized deeply\r\nwith the poor boys, who had lost their appetites from anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n_Adrift.--Skilful Navigators.--Breakers ahead.--A narrow Scratch.--Stuck\r\nin the Mud._\r\n\r\n\r\nLET us now return to the unfortunate “B. O. W. C.” who had met so\r\nunexpectedly with another adventure.\r\n\r\nOn going on board of the schooner, they found the water low; and the\r\ntide had just begun to float her in rising. As they had slept but little\r\nthe preceding night, they retired almost immediately, and soon were\r\nburied in a profound slumber. The next morning Phil was awake first. He\r\nwent up on deck, and the next instant gave a loud cry.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, boys!” he cried. “Get up! We’re adrift. Hurry up--quick!”\r\n\r\nAwaking instantly at this startling news, they tumbled up on deck\r\nwithout a moment’s delay; and there, true enough, they found themselves\r\nfar out in the bay, adrift, apparently, as Phil had said.\r\n\r\n“This is queer,” said Bruce. “Here’s her anchor down, as usual.”\r\n\r\nThe others walked to the bows where Bruce was, and saw the chain hanging\r\ndown, just as though she were anchored.\r\n\r\n“We are anchored, sure enough,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“No, we’re not; we’re drifting,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Look at the land.”\r\n\r\nA look at the land satisfied all that the vessel was actually moving\r\nthrough the water.\r\n\r\n“Let’s try the anchor. It must be dragging,” said Bart.\r\n\r\nSo they all went to work at the windlass, and in course of time found\r\nthe anchor raised. As they worked, they found it lighter than they\r\nexpected; and when at length they had ended, they ran to the bows. All\r\nwas explained. The anchor was broken off short at the fluke.\r\n\r\n“That’s how it happened,” said Bart. “And so we’re in for another\r\nadventure.”\r\n\r\n“What shall we do now?”\r\n\r\n“Sail the vessel, of course,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Where to?”\r\n\r\n“Back to Pratt’s Cove.”\r\n\r\n“And where is that?”\r\n\r\nNo one could answer that. Each one looked around carefully, in order to\r\nsee if he could find any place which looked like Pratt’s Cove. But there\r\nwere two difficulties in the way of any such discovery. In the first\r\nplace, they had approached Pratt’s Cove in the dark, and did not know\r\nhow it looked; and in the second place, they could not see any spot that\r\nlooked like a cove at all.\r\n\r\nAll around them was the bay. Before them was the Parrsboro’ shore.\r\nBehind them was Blomidon. On one side, and a little in front, were the\r\nFive Islands about six miles distant; beyond which the waters of the\r\nbay extended, till they faded away into a low, indistinct lino of coast.\r\nThey could understand, in a general way, that Pratt’s Cove lay somewhere\r\nin front of them, but they could not guess within twenty miles of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n“Let’s up sail,” said Tom, “and run up there. It looks like a cove;” and\r\nhe pointed to a hollow in the line of hills.\r\n\r\n“O, the hills around Pratt’s Cove are higher than that,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Suppose we sail over and ask O’Rafferty.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. I agree to that,” said Bart. “Bruce, you can steer.”\r\n\r\n“No. You may as well steer,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“I don’t particularly care about it,” said Bart. “Don’t any of you\r\nfellows want to?”\r\n\r\n“O, no. We don’t care. You steer, Bart. We’ll hoist the sails.”\r\n\r\nSo Bart turned away with rather a blank expression on his face, and\r\nwalked slowly to the rudder. The wind was moderate, and the water only\r\na little ruffled. The other boys, with immense confusion and shouting,\r\ntoiled away at the sails one after the other, and at last managed to get\r\nthem set.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we’d better not have the foresail up,” suggested Bart.\r\n\r\n“O, yes. Why not?” said Bruce. “Come, boys--up she rises!”\r\n\r\nAnd shouting out a sailor’s song which he had once heard, he completed\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nThe vessel moved gently through the water, and Bart pointed her head\r\ntowards the island which he considered to be O’Rafferty’s. The wind was\r\nfair, and the vessel came around very easily, and then headed away for\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nNow, it happened that, as Bart belonged to a seaport town, and as his\r\nfather was a merchant, and as Bart himself had once experienced a sea\r\nfever, and had been almost on the point of running away to sea,--he had,\r\nvery naturally, been always regarded among his companions as a great\r\nauthority on all matters connected with seamanship. And so, to a certain\r\nextent, he was. He knew all about the rigging of a ship, and understood,\r\nin a general way, the principles on which she sailed. He was also a good\r\noarsman; but in point of fact, he had never handled a sail-boat in his\r\nlife. This was owing to his father’s prudence, who allowed him to go out\r\nrowing whenever he pleased, but never permitted him to have a sail-boat.\r\nAnd so it happened that Bart knew no more about sailing than any one on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no help for it; and he had to take the tiller and\r\nassume the responsibility of the situation. After a time he began to\r\ngain confidence. The wind was moderate, the schooner was going in a\r\nstraight course, and O’Rafferty’s Island was full before him.\r\n\r\nThey went on for a long time, when at length Bruce exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t see how it is. We’ve been going to O’Rafferty’s for\r\nfull half an hour, and we are no nearer. And here we are, with Pinnacle\r\nIsland coming between us.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the currents,” said Bart, coolly. “Nobody can sail in this bay,\r\nunless he understands all about them. I’m sure I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t we better bring her about, and stand off on the other tack? We\r\ncould then steer so as to make allowance for the current, which seems to\r\nbe setting off there.”\r\n\r\n“Here, Bruce, you steer,” said Bart. “I’m tired.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, let’s bring her around first. Port your helm, Bart.”\r\n\r\nBart tried to obey; but as he turned the helm in exactly the opposite\r\nway, some confusion was the result.\r\n\r\n“Port! I said port!” cried Bruce.\r\n\r\n“O!” said Bart; and seeing that he had made a mistake, he proceeded to\r\nrectify it by turning it starboard. The vessel had turned partly; but as\r\nBruce had expected it to turn in the opposite direction, he had checked\r\nBart’s mistake. But Bruce himself knew as little about sailing as Bart,\r\nand so he had swung the sails the wrong way.\r\n\r\nThe vessel caught the wind as she came round; and Bart, who had tried to\r\nobey Bruce’s correction, finding that the vessel was all right, and\r\nwas doing very well, checked himself, and let her go. Bart now saw that\r\nBruce had made a mistake, and Bruce suspected that Bart had. But they\r\nsaid nothing, and the other boys thought that both Bruce and Bart were\r\nfirst-rate navigators.\r\n\r\nThe schooner now held on straight ahead on what Bart supposed to be\r\nthe other tack. Bruce and the others were very well satisfied with the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n“I think we’d better come round again, Bart,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Bart, who had been looking forward to this.\r\n\r\n“Port your helm, then,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\nBart turned the helm a-starboard, as he had done before, while Bruce and\r\nArthur swung the booms to assist the vessel. She came round that time\r\nall right.\r\n\r\n“Why, Bart! why didn’t you port the helm?”\r\n\r\n“Because I had to put the helm starboard to bring her round. It’s all\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nBruce looked grave. He felt that he had committed a blunder. After all,\r\nwhich was port and which was starboard he hardly knew. He concluded\r\nafter this to intrust the care of the vessel to one who knew, like Bart,\r\nand felt quite grateful to Bart for his delicacy in not exposing his\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nAway went the schooner--faster this time, for the wind had sprung up\r\nfresher. This was what Bart dreaded. But there was no help for it; so\r\nhe kept on, with a vague expectation of some disaster. He now headed, as\r\nbefore, for O’Rafferty’s Island, and watched very anxiously to see how\r\nthey were progressing.\r\n\r\n“You’d better head her a little to the north’ard, Bart,” said\r\nArthur--“hadn’t you? so as to allow for that current.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Bart; and he put the vessel a little closer in the\r\ndirection indicated.\r\n\r\nBut in doing so, the vessel began to stagger, and the sails began to\r\nflap and rattle, and Bart was filled with consternation. Hastily he\r\nrestored the helm to its former position, but without any result. Then\r\nhe tried the old manouvre, by means of which he had already turned her\r\ntwice. It was of no use. The sails flapped, and the vessel danced, and\r\nBart was about confessing his complete ignorance of everything, when\r\nsuddenly her sails filled again, and to Bart’s amazement and delight\r\nshe sailed off away from the island and back on the other tack.\r\n\r\nBart’s heart was full of thankfulness, but he said not a word. He looked\r\nahead as coolly as possible, and held the tiller as before.\r\n\r\n“Well, Bart, what are you up to now? Why don’t you head for\r\nO’Rafferty’s?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t,” said Bart, laconically.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Why, there are tides and currents about those islands enough to sweep\r\naway a line-of-battle ship. I don’t understand them. Didn’t you see what\r\na scrape I got into just now? I won’t try O’Rafferty’s again in a\r\nhurry; but if any of you fellows choose to try it, I don’t care.”\r\n\r\n“O, no,” said Bruce, “we can’t do it if you can’t, Bart. But where are\r\nyou going now?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know. We must make up our minds. I’m keeping my eye on\r\nthe coast; and if I can find any place that looks like Pratt’s Cove,\r\nI’ll run in. The fact is, we must do something, or they’ll be frightened\r\nout of their wits about us.”\r\n\r\n“Pratt’s Cove? But how can we ever find the place?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, when we get in a little closer to the land, we may see it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m confident,” said Bart, “that it’s somewhere along this coast; for\r\nit seems to me, as near as I can remember, that this is the coast we\r\nsailed to. Look at the Five Islands. There’s O’Rafferty’s; and there are\r\nthe others. You see we came out from this side of O’Rafferty’s, and then\r\nsailed up somewhere along there. I think, when we get nearer, we’ll see\r\nan opening; and perhaps we’ll hit the cove itself.”\r\n\r\nThe others seemed impressed by Bart’s words; and as none of them had\r\nanything better to suggest, they said nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd now the wind blew still more freshly, and Bart looked around with\r\ndismay. On went the schooner; but the long line of coast showed no\r\nopening whatever, and he had no idea what to do to extricate himself\r\nfrom the position in which he was. What made it worse was the confidence\r\nwhich all now felt in him.. He felt that the end would come--the moment\r\nwhen he would stand revealed in his true colors, and lose his prestige\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nMore freshly still blew the wind, and the sea around rose higher,\r\ntossing up now into white-capped waves, which every little while dashed\r\nover the bows and scattered their spray about the decks. Yielding to the\r\nwind, the vessel lay over; and on she scudded, dashing through the\r\nwater in a style which excited all on board, and intoxicated them with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Bruce. “Boys, isn’t this glorious?”\r\n\r\n“Glorious!” cried the boys; and some of them swung by their hands from\r\nthe rigging, and others danced about the deck, shouting as each wave\r\ncame splashing over the bows, and roaring with laughter when any one got\r\na ducking.\r\n\r\nHurrah! and Hurrah again!--and yet again! Their wild mirth only added\r\nnew anguish to the dismay of poor Bart, who found himself now face to\r\nface with an inextricable problem.\r\n\r\nIn their last stretch across from the Five Islands, they had drawn near\r\nto the main land, and were now moving nearer and nearer every moment.\r\nWhat was to be done? It was already time to turn; but where could he\r\nturn, or where would he go when he did turn? or, for that matter, how\r\ncould he venture to turn at all? His last experience in turning the\r\nschooner had filled him with despair. What was the meaning of those\r\nkickings, and flappings, and jumpings? What was the reason that she\r\ndidn’t mind her rudder at all? And now the wind was stronger, and the\r\nsea was rougher. Could he venture to turn the vessel with such a wind\r\nand such a sea? He felt that he could not. Anything would be better. So\r\nhe thought while taking counsel with his own soul.\r\n\r\nAnd while taking counsel with his own soul, he saw before him the coast\r\nextending invitingly. There was a long line of sand, or of mud,--which\r\nwas just as good,--into which he longed to run the vessel. Which would\r\nbe best--to run the vessel ashore, or to make the desperate attempt\r\nto turn her again, and set her kicking and plunging? He preferred the\r\nformer. Yes, to run her ashore would solve the whole difficulty. He\r\nmight be disgraced by it, but he could not help it. He felt that he\r\nwas doomed to disgrace, in any event; and it would be better to incur\r\ndisgrace on a mud bank, and in safety, than when tossing and drifting\r\nhe didn’t know where. His mind, then, was made up; and he kept the\r\nschooner’s head straight towards the shore.\r\n\r\nBut as he approached it, he was aware of one very startling fact, and\r\nthat was, that the schooner, while going forward, was also drifting\r\nrapidly to leeward. In the course of that sidelong motion, she was\r\nlosing way so rapidly, that, instead of striking the mud flats, she\r\nmight run upon a very different kind of place; for there, on the lee\r\nbow, was a headland of dark, stern rock, at the base of which the waves\r\nwere breaking into foam. In his fixed attention to the mud flats, he\r\nhad’ not noticed this till just now, when it was full before him, and\r\nnot very far away. Below this headland the mud flats appeared again.\r\n\r\nWhat could he do?\r\n\r\nAll seemed lost; for the headland, and the foaming waves, and the\r\nfrowning, jagged rocks were full before him. With a bitter feeling of\r\ndespair, and a pang of anguish for the coming fate of the friends who\r\nhad given him their trust, and who even now were singing and shouting\r\nin their uproarious glee, he stood for a moment paralyzed, looking with\r\nwhite lips at his fate.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, and just as all seemed lost, he jerked the helm a-port. The\r\nschooner swung half round. The wind took her astern, and drove her\r\nforward. Her sails flapped and banged about. Then a current seemed to\r\nseize her and carry her on for a score of yards. Suddenly there was a\r\nthump, a grinding noise, and another thump dull and heavy.\r\n\r\nIn an instant all was confusion.\r\n\r\n“The rocks! the rocks!” cried all. “She’s struck!”\r\n\r\nThen the schooner was once more swept on, and a wave, striking her\r\nstern, dashed the tiller out of Bart’s hands, and he fell. Springing up,\r\nhe seized it again, not knowing how he moved it, or when. At that moment\r\nthe sails filled again, the schooner bounded forward, and in a few\r\nminutes it was beyond the headland, and moving on toward the lower mud\r\nflat; and before they knew that they were saved, she drove hard and fast\r\ninto the mud, with a shock that knocked them all down..\r\n\r\nPicking themselves up, they looked around at the shore in bewilderment.\r\nThen they looked at Bart.\r\n\r\n“What’s all this?” they asked.\r\n\r\n“O, nothing,”’ said Bart. “I found we couldn’t do anything, and so I ran\r\nher ashore.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” cried Bruce, “that was a pretty narrow scratch we had of it\r\non those rocks. After this, Bart, I’ll always brag on you. You’ve saved\r\nour lives, Bart. I thought we were gone for it. I never saw anything\r\ndone so splendidly.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Bart was silent. Here was a chance for fame. He might avail\r\nhimself of the lucky accident, and turn it to his own glory. But the\r\nthought was only a passing one. It was at once dismissed.\r\n\r\n“No, boys,” said he; “the only thing I did was nearly to destroy your\r\nlives. In fact, I don’t know any more about sailing a vessel than any of\r\nyou. It’s been a very narrow escape. I was a fool to try it; and I can\r\nonly make amends by confessing it. I don’t believe in being a humbug,\r\nand I won’t be one any longer.”\r\n\r\nAt first the boys wouldn’t believe him, but after a while he explained\r\nall about it. After this confession, Bart was as much esteemed by his\r\nfriends as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n_In Mud and Water.--A Sea Monster.--A terrific Fight.--Wonderful Pluck\r\nof the “B. O. W. C.”--Swallowing a Sculpin.--The Trophy.--Waiting for\r\nDeliverance._\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING themselves thus fixed in the mud, they looked around to see the\r\nplace at which they had thus unexpectedly arrived. In front of them\r\nwas a bank about sixty feet high, which extended for some miles away,\r\ncommencing with the rocky headland, and covered with trees on the top;\r\nwhile beyond this, the country rose into hills. As far as they could\r\nsee, there was no opening in the shore to indicate the presence of a\r\ncove or a harbor. From the appearance of the water, it seemed as\r\nthough the mud flat extended for miles along the shore. The water was\r\ncomparatively smooth, and the headland kept off the wind, so that after\r\nthey had lowered the sails, the schooner remained quite still.\r\n\r\nIt was now about noon, and they knew that the tide was rising. A wide\r\nspace of the mud flat lay still uncovered by the water. Their position\r\nwas a safe one as yet, though not at all pleasant on many accounts.\r\n\r\n“The tide’s rising,” said Phil; “isn’t it, Bart?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“When will it be high tide?”\r\n\r\n“About three.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if they’ll come after us.”\r\n\r\n“Of course they will.”\r\n\r\n“There doesn’t seem to be much chance of our getting ashore.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it doesn’t make much difference, for we couldn’t do anything if\r\nwe did get there.”\r\n\r\n“I say, boys,” said Arthur, “the schooner’s beginning to float again.”\r\n\r\nAll stood waiting in silence, and in a few moments they felt a slight\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bruce, “the tide has risen since we struck, and is floating\r\nus in. At high tide we shall be close up under the bank.”\r\n\r\n“And then what shall we do? We must either choose to fasten the vessel\r\nashore if we can, or float out again and sail for it, or drift.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think we’ll care about sailing again, particularly as the tide\r\nwill be going out, and the night coming on.”\r\n\r\n“My idea is,” said Bruce, “to fasten her to the shore if we can, and\r\nthen go along the beach or the bank till we find some people and get\r\nhelp.”\r\n\r\n“That’s about all we can do,” said Bart. “We can’t think of going\r\nadrift, and none of us can sail the vessel; so, if they don’t come after\r\nus, we had better land, and leave the vessel; or some of us can go for\r\nhelp, and others stay on board.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if the vessel is safe here.”.\r\n\r\n“O, safe enough--if a gale don’t spring up in that case she might get\r\nknocked on the bank.”\r\n\r\n“We don’t seem to have been hurt by our knocking up there,” said Arthur.\r\n“There’s no water in the hold.”.\r\n\r\n“O, she’s all right,” said Bruce; “and she’s a gallant, gallant ship, as\r\nthe song says.”.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was steadily floated nearer and nearer to the shore as the\r\ntide rose, and the boys watched her progress with close attention. At\r\nabout three o’clock they could expect to be up to the bank, and then\r\nthey would have to find some way to fasten her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Bart, who had been looking down the shore, pointed to\r\nsomething, and said,--\r\n\r\n“Look, look! Do you see that?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you see a line--running along about a mile away?”\r\n\r\n“What, a thin, dark line? Yes. What of it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s a wier for fish. It shows that people must be living not far\r\nfrom here. It shows, too, that we can get something to eat at low tide,\r\neven if there are no people. So, hurrah, boys we’re all right yet.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said Bruce, solemnly, “I must confess that I’m starving.\r\nI’ve felt the pangs of hunger for the last two hours, and I can’t stand\r\nit any longer. I’m going to have a regular rummage down below, for I’m\r\nbound to find something.”\r\n\r\nAll the rest followed Bruce as he went below, and they began to overhaul\r\nthe whole vessel. For some time they found nothing but a beggarly array\r\nof empty boxes, and loud were their murmurs and complaints.\r\n\r\n“If it hadn’t been for that miserable Sammy Ram Ram, we’d have a few\r\nturkeys and chickens here,” said Bruce. “How that fellow and Johnny Blue\r\nmanaged to get through with them all, I can’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! those two fellows did nothing else but stuff from the time they\r\ncame on board till they got to Pratt’s Cove. Captain Corbet and the mate\r\nhelped them, and so did Pat, too, no doubt. I haven’t any hard feeling\r\nagainst any of them, but I must say I wouldn’t be sorry if their food\r\ndidn’t agree with them.”\r\n\r\n“Hallo! What’s this? Hurrah!” cried Tom, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“What, Tom,--what is it?”\r\n\r\n“See here,” cried Tom, triumphantly. “Arn’t we in luck? Don’t ever fret\r\nagain, boys. Here’s a half loaf of bread that I found in the corner.\r\nIt’s rather stale, a little too dry, and too hard,--but I think it’s\r\nabout the nicest morsel I ever saw. We’ve got our dinner provided for\r\nus, and we needn’t hanker after raw fish from the wiers any more.”\r\n\r\nTom’s joy was fully shared by all; and the half loaf of hard, stale,\r\ndried-up bread was quickly divided into five pieces, and eagerly\r\ndevoured by the famished boys.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Bruce, “I feel like a giant refreshed. I’ll go on deck\r\nand have another look at the situation. My private opinion is, however,\r\nthat if they’re coming after us, they’d better come. The tide’s getting\r\nhigher every minute; and if they get here after we’ve fastened her to\r\nthe shore, and got her high and dry, they’ll have to wait for twelve\r\ngood hours before they can get her to float off again,--not to speak of\r\nspring tides. Do you know, Bart, if this is spring tide?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, I’m sure,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, we’ll have to trust to luck, I suppose. At the same time\r\nI’ve a great mind to go ashore and reconnoitre.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go too,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“And so will I,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go too,” said Tom. “But oughtn’t some of us to stay on board?”\r\n\r\n“Stay on board? What for?”\r\n\r\n“O, to watch the vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what good will that do?”\r\n\r\n“She may drift off.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why should any of us want to drift off in her?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe there’s any chance of her drifting off while the tide\r\nis rising,” said Bruce; “and if she does drift off, I think we’re all\r\nbetter out of her than in her. So if one of us goes ashore, we’d all\r\nbetter go. It’s not more than three feet deep at the bows, and there’s a\r\nsand-spit over there within easy distance.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if there are any quicksands.”\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll have to run the risk. There are a couple of boat-hooks there,\r\nand two of us can go ahead and try the ground with them. It’s not far to\r\nthe spit.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to strip and carry our clothes with us,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Yes. It would be a great joke if we left our clothes behind, and the\r\nvessel drifted off with them.”\r\n\r\nThe boys now proceeded to undress themselves, and prepare to go ashore.\r\nEach one tied up his clothes in a compact bundle. Bruce and Bart took\r\neach a boat-hook, which lay in the schooner; Arthur took a handspike,\r\nand Tom and Phil found a stout stick each. Thus equipped, they prepared\r\nfor the journey.\r\n\r\nIt was about one o’clock, and the tide would not be high for two hours\r\nyet. In front of them, and between them-and the bank, lay a broad\r\nexpanse of mud flats, separating them from the bank by at least a\r\nquarter of a mile of distance. On their right, however, was a place\r\nwhich gave them a chance of a much better foothold than that which was\r\noffered-by the slippery and treacherous mud. This was a long sand-spit,\r\nwhich stretched out from the bank, and ran down across the mud flat and\r\ninto the water. It approached to within a hundred yards of the schooner,\r\nand afforded not only a good walking-place, but a much nearer chance of\r\ndry land than was possible anywhere else..Running down over the flat,\r\nit rose above it to a height of from twelve to twenty inches, and was\r\ncovered with sand, gravel, and round cobblestones. It was to this place\r\nthat they intended to go.\r\n\r\nBruce led the way. Descending carefully over the bows, he dropped into\r\nthe water, which he found up to his armpits. The others followed, and\r\nfound it deeper for their shorter stature. It was over the shoulders\r\nof Bart and Phil. Bart, however, took his place by Bruce’s side, and\r\nprepared to walk ahead with his pole. Their first object was to get into\r\nshallower water, and so they walked in the direction of the shore until\r\nthe water was not above their waists. Then they turned to the right,\r\ntoward the sand-spit.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for the bundles, they could have varied their\r\nprogress by swimming; but as it was, they had to wade, and feel the\r\nway cautiously, for fear of air-holes and quicksands. The surface mud\r\nbeneath their feet was very soft; but they did not sink very deeply,\r\nand with every step they acquired fresh confidence. As they neared the\r\nsand-spit, the bottom grew sensibly harder, and shoaled rapidly, till it\r\nwas not much above their knees. At length it became a sandy bottom, and\r\nthey walked along more rapidly, no longer feeling their way.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they were startled by a wild shout from Arthur. He had been\r\nwalking behind with Phil, and was some distance from the others, when\r\nrapidly, between him and them, darted the form of a large fish, which,\r\nin that shoal water, was as visible as if it were on land. At the cry\r\nwhich he gave, Bruce and the others turned, and saw Arthur with his\r\nhandspike in the air, and the fish floundering and splashing close\r\nbeside. For a moment the blood of all of them froze with horror; the\r\nnext instant Arthur sprang forward, and dealt a tremendous blow with his\r\nheavy handspike full on the head of the fish.\r\n\r\nThe monster splashed and struggled, and moved back into deeper water for\r\na few feet.\r\n\r\n“Run, run!” cried Arthur. “It’s a shark! Run for your lives!”\r\n\r\nThe boys all set off as fast as they could toward the sand-spit, which\r\nnow was close by them.\r\n\r\nBut the fish was not to be easily escaped. In a few minutes it’s dark\r\nform was beside them, and soon it crossed immediately in front of Bruce\r\nand Bart. Mechanically, and in utter horror, both the boys swung up\r\ntheir boat-hooks, and dashed them wildly against the dark figure.\r\nBoth struck home. There was a fearful splashing and writhing. Bart’s\r\nboat-hook was wrenched from his hand, and the fish darted forward into\r\nshoaler water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0201]\r\n\r\n“Run, boys, run!” shouted Bruce, holding his boathook toward the fish,\r\nand slowly retreating, so as to keep the monster in sight. Away they\r\nwent, Phil and Tom first, then Arthur. Bart moved forward, and then,\r\nseeing his pole floating a few feet on one side, made a rush for it and\r\nsecured it. Then he kept by Bruce’s side, ready to help him in guarding\r\nthe retreat of the others.\r\n\r\nThe fish continued to splash and writhe about, either because he was\r\nbewildered by the shoal water, or else because he was suffering from the\r\nwounds which had been inflicted. As he did not pursue, Bruce and Bart\r\ntook fresh courage.\r\n\r\n“Let’s finish him, Bruce!” cried Bart.\r\n\r\n“Pitch in, then!” cried Bruce; and rushing at the fish, he drove his\r\nboat-hook point deep into his side, while, at the same time, Bart,\r\nraising his into the air, struck down, so that the hooked part\r\npenetrated and held.\r\n\r\n“Hook him, ‘Bruce!” shouted Bart. “Let’s drag him ashore.” Bruce raised\r\nhis pole to do so; but at that instant the struggling, writhing fish\r\nturned towards them with furious energy, and moving over on its side,\r\nit tried to twist Bart’s hook out of its flesh. The water was so shallow\r\nthat it could not have full exercise of its strength, and Bart held on.\r\nThe fish, in its struggles, opened its gasping mouth, showing wide rows\r\nof sharp, triangular teeth. At that instant Bruce lowered his pole, and\r\ndrove it straight into the open mouth; forcing it deep into the throat.\r\nThe monster, in its agony, closed its jaws, and held it with a deathlike\r\ntenacity.\r\n\r\nA cry of triumph burst from Bruce and Bart.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah, boys! We’ve got him!” they cried. “Pull, Bruce, nearer the\r\nshore--into shoaler water.”\r\n\r\nThe water was already too shoal for the fish, which had so carelessly\r\nthrown himself into it, and his resistance could not prevent the united\r\nenergies of Bruce and Bart from dragging him forward a few paces. But\r\nthat was all. Rousing himself, the monster tossed, and writhed and\r\nstruggled, and lashed the water into foam. Bruce and Bart could no\r\nlonger drag him. It was a struggle between them; but the boys had\r\nnow got their blood up, and they would have been dragged back to the\r\nschooner rather than loose their hold.\r\n\r\nThe fish, in its fury or its agony, still kept its teeth closed on\r\nBruce’s pole, and strove to wrench it out of his grasp. His tremendous\r\nefforts were prevailing against their united strength, and were\r\ndragging them farther out. Bart’s hook had already been thrown off, and\r\nhe was plunging the pointed iron again and again into the fish’s side.\r\n\r\nAt this instant Arthur came dashing through the foam. Raising his heavy\r\nhandspike in the air, he poised it for a moment so as to take sure\r\naim, and then, with tremendous force, the weapon descended full on the\r\nmonster’s head. It was a crushing blow. The struggles and writhings\r\nceased, and changed to feeble motions and occasional convulsive\r\nvibrations. It resisted no longer. It was powerless.\r\n\r\nThey dragged it upon the dry ground of the sand-spit, and examined their\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nThe fish was about five feet long, very broad at the head and shoulders,\r\nwith a very wide mouth, armed with several rows of saw-like teeth. The\r\nnose was rounded, and the jaw was underneath. Its back was a dark slate\r\ncolor, and its belly white.\r\n\r\n“It’s what we call a Shovel-mouth Shark,” said Bruce, as he looked at\r\nit, and admired its proportions.\r\n\r\n“They call it a Dog Fish with us,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“It certainly, is a kind of shark,” said Arthur; “and as that sounds\r\nbetter, we’ll call it by that name. Boys, we’ve fought and killed a\r\nshovel-mouth shark! Let the ‘B. O. W. C.’ remember that!”\r\n\r\n“We must keep his jaws as a trophy,” said Bruce. “Let’s cut him up and\r\nget his jaws. Who’s got a knife?”\r\n\r\n“Here,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\nThereupon, with the aid of the knife, the fish was dissected. In the\r\nstomach they found a fish quite as remarkable as the one which had\r\nswallowed it. It was a sculpin, a fish whose bony covering, and spiny\r\nback, and horny head, and wonderful voracity, make it seem like those\r\nprimeval fish that swam in the waters of the world in an age when all\r\nthe inhabitants thereof were formed on a similarly monstrous model.\r\n\r\n“What a fish,” cried Bart, “to swallow a sculpin! He must be a real\r\nshark, after all, for a shark could not beat that. I thought that it\r\nmight have been by accident only that he met us, but it seems now as\r\nthough he was ravenous enough to mean mischief. ’Pon my word, if\r\nI’d known about that sculpin, I think I would have run away instead of\r\nstaying to fight.”\r\n\r\nAfter examining the fish, the jaws were removed, and, carrying them,\r\nthey walked up the sand-spit to the shore. Then dressing themselves,\r\nthey sat down and rested for a time. Then Bruce and Bart climbed to the\r\ntop of the bank, and went in different directions to explore. On coming\r\nback, each had the same story. They had met with nothing but fir trees\r\nand alder bushes, and had not seen a sign of any house whatever. On this\r\nthey all decided to go to the top of the bank, and wait patiently until\r\nthe tide was high, then fasten the schooner as well as they could, leave\r\na message on board to indicate their course, and set off along the coast\r\nin search of inhabitants. With this decision, they climbed the bank to a\r\nconspicuous position, and there waited.\r\n\r\nThe tide rose higher and higher. Each increase in the depth of the water\r\nallowed the schooner to approach nearer to the shore, though there was\r\na sidelong drift, which, from time to time, changed her position,\r\nsometimes presenting her bows to the beach, at other times her side.\r\n\r\nThe water was rising higher and still higher. The mud flats extended\r\nclose up to the beach below, but the beach itself was formed of sand and\r\ngravel, and rose, by a steep slope, from the mud flat to the base of the\r\nbank. By two o’clock the water had reached the edge of the gravel.\r\n\r\n“It will take an hour more,” said Bruce, “before it gets to high-water\r\nmark. One hour more, boys, and then off we must go to explore the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n_Scratching for Clams.--How not to eat them.--Fearful Consequences of\r\nFolly.--A formidable Medicine Chest.--Prevention better than Cure._\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANWHILE the people at Pratt’s Cove waited for the return of the\r\ncaptain and his company. The boys had excited the deepest sympathy of\r\nMrs. Pratt by their loss of appetite, and she was anxious about the\r\nlost vessel. They had not eaten anything for tea; and after the meal was\r\nover, they walked down to their old place. It was about half past six\r\no’clock, and a large part of the cove was already uncovered by the\r\nreceding tide.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if there’s any duck left,” said Jiggins, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“Or roaster,” said Muckle, with another sigh.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Pat, mournfully. “Sammy and Johnny have disposed av thim.”\r\n\r\nSammy and Johnny both looked innocently down, and by their silence\r\nacknowledged the soft impeachment.\r\n\r\n“I’ve a presentiment,” said Jiggins, “that I’m going to be very hungry\r\nbefore bed time.”\r\n\r\n“1 shouldn’t wonder if some of the rest of us were like you,” said\r\nMuckle.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Jiggins, in a grave and solemn tone, “what ought we to\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\n“We haven’t much time left,” said Muckle, suggestively.\r\n\r\n“Something must be done,” said Jiggins, emphatically.\r\n\r\n“And soon, too,” added Muckle.\r\n\r\n“Deed, thin, an’ why don’t ye go aff an’ do somethin’?” said Pat,\r\nenergetically. “Come, now, whatever ye do, I’m yer man. Is it another\r\nduck ye mane?”\r\n\r\nJiggins shook his head.\r\n\r\n“It would hardly do--”\r\n\r\n“Do--it jist wud, thin.”\r\n\r\nJiggins shook his head.\r\n\r\n“The fact is, I have my doubts about it. I don’t think it’s altogether\r\nright.”\r\n\r\n“Thin what made ye ate it for?” said Pat. “There wor others that thought\r\nit was all right--they did.”\r\n\r\n“I felt badly while eating it. I felt it was--not--right.”\r\n\r\n“Do ye mane it wasn’t done right?”\r\n\r\nJiggins shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pat, “if ye didn’t like the duck, how did ye like the pig?\r\nYe’ll not be findin’ fault with that, I think.”\r\n\r\nJiggins shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I have my doubts.”\r\n\r\n“O, botheration take your doubts. Why didn’t ye doubt before ye sat\r\ndown?”\r\n\r\nJiggins shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what,” said Muckle; “I’ve got an idea.”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried all.\r\n\r\n“Clams!” said Muckle.\r\n\r\n“Clams?” said Jiggins.\r\n\r\n“Look,” said Muckle, waving his hand over toward the flats; “do you see\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s full of clams.”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course--of course,” said Jiggins. “Why, so it is. What do you\r\nsay, boys?”\r\n\r\n“I say yis,” cried Pat. “Hurroo, boys! if we can’t have a duck, or a\r\nroaster, again, we’ll have clams.”\r\n\r\n“Hand along a basket then, Sammy,” said Jiggins.\r\n\r\nAs Sammy gave him one, he said,--\r\n\r\n“Now, you two, are you coming?”\r\n\r\n“Well--no--we don’t care about it,” said Sammy.\r\n\r\n“Well, you wait here and kindle the fire, and get a pot ready. We’ll\r\ncook them the moment we get back.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the two boys.\r\n\r\nUpon this Jiggins, and Muckle, and Pat started off after the clams.\r\nBefore leaving the shore, they got some sticks to use for scraping up\r\nthe sand, and then directed their steps toward the creek. The creek ran\r\nthrough the middle of the cove, and on each side of it the wide flats\r\nextended up to the shore. These, toward the lower part of the cove, were\r\nformed of soft mud, but at the upper part they consisted of sand, in\r\nwhich appeared a multitude of little holes, which are generally called\r\nbreathing-holes, about these parts, under the impression that they serve\r\nthis purpose for the clams. By digging where these little holes are\r\nseen, the clams may be found buried in the sand and mud.\r\n\r\nToward the upper place they walked rapidly and eagerly, and looked\r\nanxiously around for the “breathing-holes.”\r\n\r\n“Here,” said Muckle. “There are lots here.”\r\n\r\nBoth went toward where he stood.\r\n\r\n“See,” said he, pointing to the sand, which was dotted with little holes\r\nall around the place where they were standing.\r\n\r\n“That,” said Muckle, “is a sure sign.”\r\n\r\n“So it is,” said Jiggins.\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s go in.”\r\n\r\n“An’ is there oysters here, too?” asked Pat.\r\n\r\n“No; only clams.”\r\n\r\n“It’s sorry I am for that same, thin. Oysters are a dale betther.”\r\n\r\n“O, clams ain’t bad,” said Muckle, “when you can’t get oysters. So pitch\r\nin, Jiggins.”\r\n\r\nAnd Muckle, taking his stick, began to scoop up the sand.\r\n\r\nJiggins began to do the same; and for some time both worked diligently.\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Jiggins, at last. “That stick’s no good.”\r\n\r\n“No good? Why not?”\r\n\r\n“It won’t hold the sand.”\r\n\r\n“Mine does very well.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I might as well have nothing. It’s like trying to eat rice with a\r\nchopstick, Chinese fashion. I’m going to try another plan.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Why, like the hens. I’m going to scratch for my food,” said Jiggins.\r\n“What were fingers made for?”\r\n\r\nAnd saying this, he began scratching up the sand.\r\n\r\n“Bedad! an’ if you’re the hen, I’ll be the chicken, an’ ate what you\r\nscratch up.”\r\n\r\n“Will you?” asked Jiggins.\r\n\r\n“I will thin.”\r\n\r\n“Whatever I scratch up?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--if they’re clams.”\r\n\r\n“But you’ll have to eat them raw.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sure it’s raw I mane.”\r\n\r\n“Why, man alive, it’ll make you sick.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll risk it. Sick is it? Not a bit of it.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever eat any raw clams, Pat?”\r\n\r\n“Av coorse. Why not? and raw oysters, too.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you won’t blame me?”\r\n\r\n“Is it blame? Not a bit of it. Niver fare.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, I’ll scratch for you then.”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead, thin.”\r\n\r\nSo Jiggins began, and scratched for some time.\r\n\r\n“Here’s your first clam,” said he, throwing out one to Pat.\r\n\r\nPat opened it, and swallowed it with extraordinary celerity.\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t that look as if I knowed how?” said he, biting off the black\r\ntip of the clam, and throwing it down. “Scratch them along, my boy.”\r\n\r\n“All right; here’s another.”\r\n\r\n“An’ here’s to your very good health, an’ long life to ye,” said Pat,\r\nas he swallowed it.\r\n\r\n“Here’s another--and here--and here--and here, too--and here’s three.”\r\n\r\n“Faith, thin, the more the merrier, and it’s meself that’s glad to see\r\nthim same,” said Pat, as he seized and opened them, one by one, and sent\r\nthem flying after the others.\r\n\r\n“How do you feel now?” asked Jiggins, after he had scratched for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“Sure I feel better than iver; an’ why not?”\r\n\r\n“All right. Here are some more. Go it, Pat.”\r\n\r\n“Go it it is,” said Pat, seizing the clams with undiminished avidity,\r\nand devouring them.\r\n\r\n“Here’s more, Pat. Don’t blame me if you see the ghost of your\r\ngrandmother in your dreams tonight. And here’s more. Don’t blame me if\r\nyou have the gripes, and have to stand on your head all night.”\r\n\r\n“Niver you fare for me; but you go on wid yer scratching an’ let me ate\r\nin pace.”\r\n\r\nThe clams now came forth fast and furious. Muckle had found a place\r\nfilled with them, and had heaped up his basket. Jiggins had a large pile\r\non the sand, in front of which Pat had taken his station, and was vainly\r\ntrying to keep up with Jiggins. But it was impossible, for Jiggins had\r\nfound large numbers closely packed together.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter over there?” said Muckle. “Have you filled your\r\nbasket, Jiggins?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet. I’m busy filling Pat,” said Jiggins. “Hallo, Pat, you’re slow\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\n“Niver fare. Slow is it? Thin I’ll be up wid ye before long. On’y give\r\nme time, as the schoolmaster said when they wor examinin’ him on the\r\nalphabet.”\r\n\r\n“All right. But while I’m waiting, I’ll put these in the basket,” said\r\nJiggins; and he began to fill his basket from the pile.\r\n\r\n“How can I ate them when you’re putting them in the basket?” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“I’ll dig up plenty more--enough to keep you going.”\r\n\r\nBut Jiggins was tired; and after digging up some more he found the sand\r\ntinged red. To his amazement he saw that his nails were worn away, and\r\nwere now bleeding. His fingers’ ends began to smart with acute pain, and\r\nhe was compelled to desist.\r\n\r\n“I think I’ll be off,” said he. “Pat, you may eat from the basket.”\r\n\r\n“From the basket, is it? Not a bit of it,” said Pat; “I’ll only eat from\r\nyour scratching.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve scratched the basket full for you, and that’s enough. In fact\r\nit’s too much,” he added, as he felt fresh stings on his finger tips.\r\n“Besides, I’ve my doubts about it.”\r\n\r\n“Yer doubts, is it? and again? An’ what for this time?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see, I’m afraid it’s not altogether fair to you.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a quare bird, wid yer doubts, an’ that’s all about it,” said\r\nPat.\r\n\r\nThey then went back to the bank, where a bright fire was burning, and\r\nthe pot was all ready, with sea-water boiling in it. Into this they\r\nthrew the clams; and sitting down around the fire, they waited.\r\n\r\nPat sat in silence. There was a peculiar expression on his face. He grew\r\nmoody and preoccupied. Frequent sighs escaped him.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, Pat?” asked Jiggins.\r\n\r\n“O, nothin’.”\r\n\r\nPat struggled against his secret grief most valiantly, but soon he could\r\nstruggle no longer. A deep groan burst from him, and he fell back\r\ndoubled up and writhing. His face was deadly pale, and big drops of\r\nperspiration stood on his brow. In his pain he rolled over and over, and\r\nmoans and low cries escaped him.\r\n\r\n“It’s the clams!” cried Jiggins. “O, I knew it. I had my doubts about it\r\nall the time.”\r\n\r\n“What can we do?” cried Johnny.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to get him up to Captain Pratt’s,” said Muckle:\r\n\r\nBut for a long time they could do nothing. He writhed and struggled so\r\nthat he could not be moved. At last Johnny Blue ran up for Mrs. Pratt.\r\nThe good lady came down with a basket full of infallible remedies, and\r\ntended poor Pat for some time. At last he was easier, and they managed\r\nto get him up to the house, and put him in bed.\r\n\r\nJiggins went back with the others, and finished the clams. All were\r\nsilent except Jiggins, who, every little while, would solemnly shake his\r\nhead, and slowly ejaculate--\r\n\r\n“It was _not_ right. No, boys, it was _not_ right. I felt so, for I had\r\nmy doubts about it all the time.”\r\n\r\nOne thing surprised Mrs. Pratt when she was administering to Pat’s woes\r\non the bank; and that was, the very savory smell of that clam stew which\r\nwas simmering in a pot behind the bushes. She could not understand it,\r\nbut concluded that it must be some great delicacy among the vessel’s\r\nstores lying on the bank, which had so very fragrant an odor. Afterward,\r\nwhen her mind was less preoccupied,--when Pat had been well rubbed, and\r\npoulticed, and blistered, and plied with herb tea, and all those other\r\nmedicaments which the “medicine women” of the rural districts love so\r\nwell; after all this had been attended to, then she began to think once\r\nmore about that fragrant odor. And gradually, as she thought about it,\r\nthere arose in her mind a conjecture as to what that odor might have\r\narisen from; and the conjecture gathered itself inseparably around the\r\nidea of--“clams.”\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Pratt that thought was a momentous one.\r\n\r\nFor what did that involve?\r\n\r\nIt meant that there was danger abroad,--danger which impended over the\r\nyoung charges committed to her, and which she must counteract. It meant\r\nthat some of them had been eating clams in the month of May--an act\r\nwhich, in her estimation, might produce consequences which could only be\r\ncalled terrible.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this great possible danger, Mrs. Pratt gathered herself\r\nup, and prepared to meet it boldly. Already all her doctoring instincts\r\nhad been roused into full play by the case of Pat, and having begun a\r\ngood work, it was not easy to stop abruptly. She had got her hand in, as\r\nthe saying is, and she wanted to finish her work. It did not take long\r\nfor her to come to the stern conclusion that the work must be fully\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nSo she first of all brought forth her little store of medicaments of all\r\nkinds, and ranged them on the kitchen table. They presented a formidable\r\nshow. There were,--\r\n\r\n     1 bottle Mint tea.\r\n\r\n     1 “   Essence of peppermint.\r\n     1 “   Ginger extract.\r\n     1 “   Cayenne pepper extract.\r\n     1 “   Paregoric.\r\n     1 “   Rum and onions.\r\n     1 “   Sulphur and molasses.\r\n     1 “   Sour cream.\r\n     1 “   Eye wash.\r\n     1 “   Pratt’s pain killer..\r\n     1 “   Hemlock water.\r\n     1 “   Tar water.\r\n     1 “   Poppy juice.\r\n     1 “   Essence of smoko.\r\n     1 “   Brandy and salt.\r\n     1 “   Castor oil.\r\n     1 “   Camomile water.\r\n     1 “   Mineral water.\r\n     1 “   Pratt’s antidote.\r\n     1 “   Hair wash.\r\n     1 “   Ear wash.\r\n     1 “   Toothache drops.\r\n     1 “   Creosote.\r\n     1 “   Rowland’s Macassar oil.\r\n     1 “   Cocoaine.\r\n\r\n     1 bottle Salt and treacle.\r\n     1 “   Antibilions mixture.\r\n     1 “   Arnica.\r\n     1 “   Opodeldoc.\r\n     1 “   Hartshorn.\r\n     1 “   Aromatic vinegar.\r\n     1 “   Sweet oil.\r\n     1 “   Benzine.\r\n     1 “   Grease eradicator.\r\n     1 “   Lye.\r\n     1 “   Tobacco water.\r\n     1 “   Wild honey.\r\n     1 “   Lime juice.\r\n     1 “   Alcohol.\r\n     1 “   Cod liver oil.\r\n     1 “   Neats foot oil.\r\n\r\n     In addition to these, she had,--\r\n\r\n     1 parcel Wormwood.\r\n     1 “   Camomile flowers,\r\n     1 “   Cardamum seeds.\r\n     1 “   Birch bark.\r\n     1 “   Spruce gum.\r\n     1 “   Bosin.\r\n     1 “   Dandelion.\r\n     1 “   Elm bark.\r\n     1 “   Elder berries.\r\n     1 “   Hops.\r\n     1 “   Gum arabic.\r\n     1 “   Catnip.\r\n\r\n     1 parcel Spearmint.\r\n     1 “   Peppermint.\r\n     1 “   Beeswax.\r\n     1 “   Boot ginger.\r\n     1 “   Cloves.\r\n     1 “   Alum.\r\n     1 “   Magnesia.\r\n     1 “   Balm of Giles\r\n     1 “   Horseradish.\r\n     1 “   Flagroot.\r\n     1 “   Sarsaparilla.\r\n     1 “   Sassafras.\r\n     1 “   Soap.\r\n     1 pot Pomatum.\r\n     1 box Lard.\r\n     1 bundle Lint.\r\n     1 parcel Senna.\r\n     1 pot Mucilage.\r\n     1 parcel Salts.\r\n     1 “   Cotton wool.\r\n     1 “   Diachylon.\r\n     1 pot Mustard.\r\n     1 parcel Calomel.\r\n     1 box Blue pills.\r\n     1 “   Cantharides.\r\n     1 “   Garlic.\r\n     1 “   White lead.\r\n\r\nAnd a great many other things, which had accumulated in her closet, and\r\nwhich she now brought forth for the especial benefit of the four boys.\r\nHaving selected some from among these, she sat calmly awaiting their\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nWhen the boys came back from the bank,--. where they had been enjoying\r\ntheir clam stew,--. this was the sight that greeted their eyes on\r\nentering the kitchen: a table filled with bottles and vials, another\r\ntable filled with parcels and bundles, and on the floor jugs, boxes,\r\nkegs, firkins, and bags, in the midst of all of which sat Mrs. Pratt,\r\nwith her eyes gleaming, from behind her spectacles, upon them, and an\r\nexpression of benevolent yet unshakable resolution upon her face.\r\n\r\nThe boys entered one by one, and took their seats, looking suspiciously\r\naround. There was something in the general appearance of things which\r\ndid not altogether satisfy them.\r\n\r\n“Ehem--ehe-e-em!” said Jiggins, at last, to whom the suspense was\r\nbecoming intolerable.\r\n\r\nA long silence followed.\r\n\r\n“Ehem!” he remarked again; but Mrs. Pratt made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Ehe-e-em!” he remarked a third time. “Is--ah--is Pat--ah--any better?”\r\n\r\n“Considerable,” said Mrs. Pratt. “Yes, _con_siderable.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right--that’s good. I feel very much relieved. I’ve blamed\r\nmyself very much for letting him do as he did.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Pratt gave a long sigh.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” she asked. “You all had clams, as well as he. You\r\nhad a clam stew. Why should he suffer more’n you’ns?”\r\n\r\nThe boys started, and looked at one another. How in the world had Mrs.\r\nPratt found out about the clams? They felt uneasy at first, but soon\r\nrecollected that, after all, cooking clams was no harm. So they regained\r\ntheir courage.\r\n\r\n“Why, you see,” said Jiggins, at last, “it was different with Pat. We\r\nhad them cooked, but he ate them raw.”\r\n\r\n“And you think that makes any difference,” said Mrs. Pratt, grimly.\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly--of course,” said Jiggins, looking at Mrs. Pratt\r\nanxiously; while all the other boys stared at her in dire anticipation\r\nof some fearful disclosure.\r\n\r\n“Not a mite,” said Mrs. Pratt. “There isn’t a mite of difference between\r\nyou,--_all_ of you, mind, and him,--on’y he was kind o’ took bad\r\nat onst, an’ you’re a waitin’. Let me sec. How long is it since you\r\nfinished eatin’?”\r\n\r\n“O, only a few minutes,” said Jiggins, nervously.\r\n\r\n“Well, I supposed so. Ye-ry well,” repeated Mrs. Pratt, in the tone of\r\na cool physician, who feels gratified when a disease takes the form he\r\nsuspected, even when it is attended with pain and danger to the patient.\r\n“Yes, that’s it; and now can you remember how long a time it was after\r\nPat had done eating the raw clams to the fust pain he felt?”\r\n\r\nThe boys looked in fearful anxiety at one another, and then all eyes\r\nturned to Jiggins. He turned pale, and all the expression of his face\r\nchanged to one dismal blank.\r\n\r\n“Can’t any of you remember?” repeated Mrs. Pratt. “How long was it?”\r\n\r\n“Well--as near as I can remember,” said Jig-gins, in a faltering voice,\r\n“it’s--about--I should think--somewhere near--perhaps--the neighborhood\r\nof half an hour--that is, more or less.”\r\n\r\n“About half an hour. I thought so,” said Mrs. Pratt, remorselessly.\r\n\r\n“Somewhere about that,” said Jiggins.\r\n\r\n“Till he felt his fust pains?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mrs. Pratt, with a benevolent smile, “somewhere about half\r\nan hour from this you’ll feel the same.”\r\n\r\nShe paused, and watched the effect of this fearful announcement.\r\n\r\nThe effect was powerful. Four pale faces looked, with awful eyes, at\r\nher, and at one another. Not a word was spoken in reply.\r\n\r\n“Yes, every one of you. You’ve all eaten, I s’pose.”\r\n\r\nJiggins nodded mournfully.\r\n\r\n“And plenty, too.”\r\n\r\nAnother nod.\r\n\r\n“Very well. You’ll have it hot and heavy, mind I tell you. Pat will be\r\nbeginning to feel quite comfortable just as you begin to get took.”\r\n\r\n“But--but,” ‘said Jiggins, rousing himself despairingly, “I\r\nthought--that is, I always heard--that clams were good stewed--and I\r\nnever heard that even raw clams were bad, except when you took too many\r\nof them.”\r\n\r\n“Shows how your parients neglected your edication,” said Mrs. Pratt,\r\nloftily. “They didn’t understand the natur’ of the clam, certain. It\r\nisn’t the cooking, or the not cooking, of the clam that makes it so\r\ndangerous; it’s the clam itself--or rather, the clam at this season of\r\nthe year. That’s what makes it dangerous.”\r\n\r\n“This season of the year? Why, what’s that got to do with it?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you ever heard of that? Dear! dear! dear! An’ yet you go to the\r\nAcademy, and don’t know about clams. Dear! dear! dear!”\r\n\r\n“They don’t teach about clams there,” said Jiggins, morosely.\r\n\r\n“So you don’t know the danger there is in eating them now.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll tell you--they’re _pison!_”\r\n\r\n“Poison!” ejaculated the others, in horror at the thrilling whisper in\r\nwhich Mrs. Pratt hurled this word at them.\r\n\r\n“Yes, _pison!_ Hain’t you ever heerd the old lines,\r\n\r\n                   ‘In the months without the “R,”\r\n\r\n                   Clams a deadly pison are’?\r\n\r\nThat means May, June, July, and August. Another verse, says,\r\n\r\n                   ‘In August, May, July, and June,\r\n\r\n                   All shell fishes lead to ruin.’\r\n\r\nThat means, you see, that in the summer months these things are as bad\r\nas pison.”\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?” cried Jiggins, after a long, despairing silence, in\r\nwhich these fearful words sank deep into the hearts of all. “What shall\r\nwe do?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mrs. Pratt, with a benevolent smile, “you’d ort ter be\r\nthankful that you’ve got me. I am jest the person to treat your case.\r\nI’ve got the medicine all ready. If you take it in time, you may avoid\r\ntrouble. As there’s only been a few minutes sence you ate the pison\r\nclams, p’raps you may get off without much pain. I’ve jest got some herb\r\ntea, some drinks of different kinds, some mustard poultices, and two or\r\nthree more mixtures for you. I won’t bleed any of you if I can help it.\r\nOnly jest give yourselves up to me, and trust to me. But there must be\r\nno delay. I have the mixtures all ready.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Mrs. Pratt rose like an ogress, and advanced upon the\r\nunhappy boys. Filled with fears of poison, looking upon her as their\r\nonly safety, they made no resistance, but swallowed, one by one, the\r\nnauseous mixtures which were given. And still she stood over them,\r\ntalking about the danger before them, and forcing upon them more\r\nmedicaments.\r\n\r\nThen came the mustard plasters.\r\n\r\nBut enough. Let us draw a curtain over the sufferings of the unhappy\r\nfour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n_New Hopes and Plans.--A Sail!--A bitter Disappointment.--A hazardous\r\nAdventure, and a Fright.--Quilts for Togas.--Another tremendous\r\nCasualty._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE, on the top of the bank, sat the five boys of the “B. O. W. C.,”\r\n waiting patiently. “Only an hour more, boys,” repeated Bruce. “Well, if\r\nthey don’t come, we’ll survive it,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“I suppose we shall start off at once, if they don’t come.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, as soon as the tide begins to fall.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if it will carry the schooner with it.”\r\n\r\n“I think that it will.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it will leave it aground.”\r\n\r\n“All right. That will be so much the better for us. It would be a pity\r\nto lose the schooner so soon.”\r\n\r\n“O, she won’t be lost.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she will. What’ll prevent her? She’ll be carried ashore on some\r\nrocks and broken to pieces, or she’ll drift out into the Bay of Fundy.”\r\n\r\n“O, she has other chances in her favor. She may drift on some mud-flat\r\nlike this, or she may be picked up on the basin, or, if she does get out\r\ninto the Bay of Fundy, she may get picked up there.”\r\n\r\n“That may be; but, after all, it’ll be hard on Corbet; and he’s rather\r\npoor.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll serve him right,” exclaimed Tom Crawford. “He must have known\r\nthat his anchor was broken.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it certainly does serve him right, if he knew that; but he’s a\r\ncareless fellow, and I dare say he didn’t know anything about it.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder where this coast goes?” asked Phil Kennedy.\r\n\r\n“Well, it goes in two directions,” said Bart. “Which way do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“The right.”\r\n\r\n“O, that goes to Parrsboro’ Village; the left leads up to Pratt’s Cove.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell just where Pratt’s Cove is, but I know the direction in\r\nwhich it must lie from here,” said Bart. “You can tell that by seeing\r\nthe way the Five Islands lie toward us. If they come for us, they’ll\r\nhave to come from behind that headland.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if they’ll come by land or water.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how they can come by land.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a road, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“O, ever so far back. How could any one find anything about us on the\r\nroad? No; they’ll come by water, so as to find us either afloat or\r\nashore.”\r\n\r\n“There isn’t any boat at all in Pratt’s Cove.”\r\n\r\n“O, there must be other coves near, where they can get other boats.”\r\n\r\n“It will be hard for us, if they don’t happen to have a boat.”\r\n\r\n“O, they’ll get one.”\r\n\r\n“And meanwhile we must act for ourselves; for I don’t believe they’ll\r\nget one to-day, at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we may as well prepare for an expedition along the coast.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we separate, or go together?”\r\n\r\n“O, together, by all means. But, hallo! what’s that?”\r\n\r\nAt this exclamation from Bart, all looked where his eyes were turned.\r\n\r\n“A schooner!” they cried; “a schooner! There they come! Hurrah, boys!\r\nwe’re all right.” Instantly every one sprang to his feet. “Come, boys,\r\ntake off your shirts,” said Bruce, as he pulled off his own. “Let’s get\r\nready a supply of red bunting to make signals to them.” Instantly all\r\nof them tore off their shirts, and waved them wildly from the top of the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nYes, it was a schooner. It had come thus suddenly upon them as they were\r\ntalking; and even though they had been on the constant lookout, yet its\r\nappearance had startled them all. It was twice as large as the\r\nAntelope, of a bright green color; its masts were yellow, and its sails\r\nbeautifully neat. Spreading its snow-white wings to the breeze, it\r\ncame bounding over the waves from behind the headland, and directed its\r\ncourse in toward the shore.\r\n\r\n“She’s not heading for us at all,” said Bruce. “If she keeps on in that\r\ndirection, she’ll be a mile down beyond us before we know it.”\r\n\r\n“She don’t see us,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Wave your signals, then! Ah, what a pity we hadn’t a good signal-post!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll climb a tree,” said Phil, looking around.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t any tree fit for the purpose. The highest ones are hidden\r\nby the smaller ones in front. This is as conspicuous a place as we can\r\nfind.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the schooner kept on at an angle with them, and pursued her\r\nway without taking any notice’ of them, heading toward a point far down\r\nto the right of the place where they were standing.\r\n\r\nWith a face of stern determination, and the air of a captain of a\r\nbattery, Bart drew his pistol.\r\n\r\n“I’ll fire,” said he, solemnly.\r\n\r\nThe next instant, bang! or, rather, pop! went the pistol.\r\n\r\nBut the schooner took not the smallest notice even of that overpowering\r\ndemonstration. On the contrary, it kept straight on without altering its\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n“They’re blind, and deaf, too; and that’s all about it,” cried Phil\r\nKennedy, in deep disgust.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what’s the matter with them,” said Bruce. “They don’t keep a\r\nvery good lookout, or they’d surely see us. There’s red flannel enough\r\nhere to be seen five miles off.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder who is steering.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder who those two chaps are in the bow. Can it be Bogud and the\r\nmate?”\r\n\r\n“I wonder who that old boy in a pea-jacket can be? It surely can’t be\r\nMr. Simmons?”\r\n\r\n“It’s Captain Corbet.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! Captain Corbet is steering.”\r\n\r\n“No, that’s the mate.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t, either. Don’t you see the mate on the bow?”\r\n\r\n“That the mate! That’s Mr. Long.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! Mr. Long don’t generally go in his shirtsleeves.”\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t he? I s’pose he is helping the others. He’d just as soon\r\ntake off his coat as not, if he had anything to do.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t Mr. Long, any way.”\r\n\r\nBut these wonders and conjectures were now interrupted by a movement on\r\nthe part of the schooner. She had already gone beyond the spot where the\r\nboys were standing, and had come to within half a mile of the beach.\r\nShe now wore round. Flap went the sails! there was a quick movement\r\non board, and then away she went on another tack, with her head turned\r\ntoward the opposite shore.\r\n\r\n“She’s leaving us!” cried Bruce, aghast.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments all stood in silent dismay. This was a thing which\r\nthey were not prepared for. If no schooner had come at all, they could\r\neasily have borne up; but now, since one had come, they had not for\r\na moment doubted their speedy deliverance. There was not hope, but\r\ncertainty, in her appearance. But now this was dashed to the ground, and\r\nthe reaction was extreme.\r\n\r\nBart was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n“1 tell you what, boys,” he cried, “I don’t believe it was them at all.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, it was,” said Arthur. “I recognized Captain Corbet.”\r\n\r\n“No; you may depend upon it, you were utterly mistaken. Why, do you\r\nsuppose, if they were after us, they would have come and gone so coolly?\r\nThere wasn’t the slightest sign of any anxiety, or curiosity about them.\r\nIf it had been our friends, they’d have seen our signals soon enough.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and the Antelope down there nearly ashore.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know. But I certainly thought I recognized Captain\r\nCorbet.”\r\n\r\n“I thought I saw Bogud.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it. They were strangers, and that accounts for\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Tom, “all that we’ve got to do is to wait for a few\r\nminutes more, and then start.”\r\n\r\n“I say, boys,” said Bart, after a fit of musing, “what a pity it is that\r\nwe can’t fasten the vessel somehow, and keep her here! There’s an old\r\ntree at the bottom of the bank big enough to moor a ship at. If we could\r\nonly get a line around it from the schooner, we could keep the vessel\r\nhere till they did come.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that would be the best plan,” said Bruce; “for I’ve-been thinking\r\nthat we may find some people here who would sail the schooner back to\r\nthe cove. It would be a great pity to let her drift.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity that we can’t get at her,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“And why can’t we?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\nWhy! The question at once made every one stare and think. Each one could\r\nanswer in his own mind why such a thing could not be done, but no one\r\nstated such a reason. All were silent.\r\n\r\n“It’s not very far,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Not so far as it was to wade when we landed.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a fact.”\r\n\r\n“And I move that we try, it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that’s all very well!” said Phil. “But who _will_ try it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, _I_ will,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“O, then, if it comes to that, I’ll go too,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“So will I,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“And I’ll be with you, boys,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Of course you will,” said Bart.-“But what’s the use of all of us going.\r\nTwo of us will be enough. Bruce and I can take our poles and do it. It’s\r\nnot much any way.”\r\n\r\n“And I’ll go with my handspike,” said Arthur. “In fact, I don’t think we\r\nneed even boat-hooks,” said Bruce. “The bottom is hard sand just there,\r\nall the way out to the vessel. It’s as safe as a floor.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, except for one thing,” said Arthur, holding up the jaw of the\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n“Hm!” said Bruce. “For my part, I don’t believe there’s any danger just\r\nhere. It’s too near the bank, I never heard of them coming in so near\r\nhigh-water mark; but, at the same time, I dare say it will be better to\r\ntake the boat-hooks.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes. We’ll feel safer,” said Bart, “and that’s something. One\r\nadvantage will be, that we won’t be bothered with our bundles.”\r\n\r\n“How do you propose to do?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Well, to board her and get a line.”\r\n\r\n“Will any of the lines be strong enough?”\r\n\r\n“Well, my idea is, to let down the chain, fasten the rope to the anchor\r\nstump, and all of us can then drag it ashore. We can then wait till\r\nthe tide brings the vessel near enough for us to pass the line, or the\r\nchain, around the tree.”\r\n\r\n“That ought to hold it,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Of course it will.”\r\n\r\n“Very well then. Let’s start. And first of all, let’s strip.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take the pistol, Bart,” said Phil, as Bart laid it down before\r\ntaking off his belt; “and if anything happens, I’ll fire.”\r\n\r\n“All right, my son,” said Bart.\r\n\r\nThey all went down then to the beach below, where they stripped, and the\r\nadventurous five went into the water, although only three were going on\r\nboard; for Tom and Phil, felt bound in honor to share the possible peril\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\nThe water had risen a little up the steep declivity of the pebbled\r\nbeach, and the vessel was some distance nearer than she had been when\r\nthey first climbed the bank. It was a favorable time for starting, but\r\nnot so much so as it would be in the course of half an hour. But they\r\nwere too impatient to delay, and so they started. As it was, they had\r\nnot more than fifty yards to go.\r\n\r\nThe bottom was not muddy just here, but composed of hard’ sand, like\r\nthe sand-spit on which they had landed. The water was quite smooth, only\r\ndisturbed by a gentle ripple, which, farther out, rose into small waves.\r\nThe descent, like that farther out, was but very gradual, and it was\r\nonly by almost imperceptible degrees that the water deepened.\r\n\r\nBruce and Bart went first, with their poles held in their hands in such\r\na way that they were able to splash the water before them, so that if\r\nthere should chance to be any more “shovel-mouth sharks” near by, they\r\nmight take notice and govern themselves accordingly. For they firmly\r\nbelieved that all fish are frightened by any splashing, and deterred,\r\njust as wild animals are frightened and deterred, by the flashing of\r\nflames.\r\n\r\nTom and Phil followed more slowly, the former armed with a boat-hook,\r\nand the latter with the pistol. The distance was quickly traversed. The\r\nwater grew deeper and deeper, until it was up to Bruce’s armpits and\r\nBart’s shoulders. By that time they touched the schooner’s bows.\r\n\r\nAt that instant a splash was heard close by them, and the movement of\r\nsome body was felt amid the waters.\r\n\r\n“Up! Quick!” cried Bruce.\r\n\r\n“You go first,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“I won’t,” cried Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Nor will I,” said Bart.\r\n\r\nBruce said no more. He stooped down, and clasping Bart in his brawny\r\narms, he jerked him up out of the water. Bart clambered on board, and\r\nheld out his hand to Bruce. Another instant and the latter stood by his\r\nside. Arthur followed at the same time.\r\n\r\n“Did you see that?” asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Did you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. What was it?”\r\n\r\n“Another shovel-month shark--wasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so. It wasn’t the same color. It was white.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it turned over to bite.”\r\n\r\nArthur shook his head.\r\n\r\n“‘No. It came between us. It was not so large as that other fellow. It\r\ndashed off at once.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it was only a codfish,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Well, it was a large one, then. It might have been a porpoise. I wonder\r\nif porpoises come so near the shore.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, but not often.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t wonder if it was a sturgeon,” said Arthur. “After all, it\r\nmay only have been a codfish. At the same time I’d much rather be here\r\nthan down there.”\r\n\r\n“Boys!” shouted Bruce to Tom and Phil. “Boys, you may as well go ashore.\r\nand dress. We’ll stay here a little while. It’ll take some time to get\r\nthings ready.”\r\n\r\nAt this Tom and Phil went back and dressed.\r\n\r\nThe fish which they had last seen had produced a very solemnizing effect\r\non their minds. There came over them a horror of that treacherous water.\r\nThey felt an aversion toward venturing in again, and were sorry that\r\nthey had come. But there was no help for it. There they were now, though\r\neach one felt that he could not venture back again into the water\r\nvery readily. It might have been a sturgeon, or a porpoise, or even a\r\ncodfish; but the horror of its presence was still there, whatever it\r\nwas. It was some time before they could rally from the panic which had\r\nfilled them as they tumbled on board. And though each said but little\r\nabout it, and alluded to it very lightly, yet each one understood pretty\r\ntruly the feelings of the others.\r\n\r\n“Come, boys, hurry up!”\r\n\r\nThis was the cry that Phil and Tom sent them from the beach. They had\r\ndressed, and were watching them with impatience.\r\n\r\n“We’re going to wait till she gets nearer,” cried Bruce. “At high tide\r\nshe will be close to the beach, and we won’t have to drag the chain so\r\nfar.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better come now,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart; “the chain won’t reach so far.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Tom. “We’ll go up the bank again till you’re ready.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, the two boys clambered up the bank, when they rambled a\r\nlittle into the woods. Arthur and Bart then found a line, one end of\r\nwhich they fastened, to the anchor. It was their intention to take\r\nthe line ashore, and let go the whole chain, which they hoped could\r\nbe pulled to the beach as far as the tree. Before that could be done,\r\nhowever, it would be necessary for the schooner to be much nearer. The\r\nwater was already rising, and there yet remained many feet to be covered\r\nbefore the tide would reach what they considered as high-water mark.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it will be high tide for an hour yet. It will be an\r\nhour later than we calculated,” said Bruce. “Hang it, it’s too cold\r\nhere. I wish we had our clothes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m not going to freeze any longer,” said Bart, jumping down\r\ninto the hold. He was absent for a few minutes, and soon returned with\r\na quilt gracefully wrapped around him like a Roman toga. With a laugh,\r\nArthur and Bruce jumped down, and imitated his example. Then coming\r\non deck again, they joined Bart, and the boys professed to be very\r\ncomfortable, considering all things.\r\n\r\nThey now took their seats at the stem, and looked out to sea, watching\r\nfor any signs of relief. This occupied them for a longer time than they\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what’s become of Tom and Phil,” said Arthur, suddenly jumping\r\nup and looking toward the shore.\r\n\r\nThe others did the same.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they done so, when a cry of dismay burst from them.\r\n\r\nThe shore was at least five hundred yards away. Phil and Tom were\r\nscrambling down the bank, gesticulating wildly.\r\n\r\n“What’s all this?” cried Arthur.\r\n\r\nFor a moment no one answered; but at last Bart said, in a voice\r\ntremulous with agitation,--\r\n\r\n“We’ve mistaken the high-water mark altogether, boys. It must have been\r\nhigh tide when we came on board. We’ve been drifting off ever since.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t we wade ashore?” said Arthur.\r\n\r\nBruce seized a boat-hook, and plunged it over the vessel’s side into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t do it,” he said, slowly. “There are eight or nine feet of\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t we swim?”\r\n\r\n“Will you try it?”\r\n\r\nEach one looked at the other, but there was no assent to this. It was\r\nnot the mere distance, but the other perils of the deep that deterred\r\nthem, and more than all, the remembrance of their last panic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n_On the briny Deep, and on the muddy Shore.--The Fisherman’s\r\nBoat.--Reappearance of old Friends.--Remonstrances, Explanations, and\r\nConfessions._\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANWHILE,--even while they were speaking,--every moment drew them\r\nfarther away from the shore. They saw Tom and Phil standing on the\r\nbeach, which they had reached by this time, and waving their hands\r\nwith frantic gesticulations. They heard them, shout, “Come back! You’re\r\nadrift!” and other words not intelligible. They shouted back again to\r\nencourage them, though they, themselves had but little hope.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t any anchor, boys,” said Bart; “but let’s put down what we\r\nhave. It may hold, or, at least, prevent our drifting so fast.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s nothing else to be done,” said Bruce; “so I suppose we\r\nmay as well try it. Come along, boys. We must do what we can.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he led the way to the windlass, and the remnant of the\r\nanchor was let go.\r\n\r\nThey waited a little while to see what effect this would have, but in a\r\nfew moments saw that very-little was produced.\r\n\r\n“No go,” said Bruce. “Suppose we give her the whole chain.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart. “It may hold her if it is all out.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Arthur, “it will prevent her drifting somewhat.”\r\n\r\n“Down she goes, then,” said Bruce, as the chain ran out. Soon it was out\r\nat its fullest extent, and they again watched to see what effect would\r\nbe produced. By this time they had gone very much farther from the\r\nshore, and Tom and Phil were just discernible.\r\n\r\n“It checks her a little,” said Bart, “yet very little. As to holding\r\nher, that is out of the question.”\r\n\r\n“And yet there can’t be much of a current here.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know as to that. It is difficult to tell anything about it.\r\nThere are currents in all sorts of places around the bay.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, if we let it drag for a while,” said Bruce, “it may catch\r\nsomewhere and hold. I’ve heard, of such things.”\r\n\r\n“There’s very little chance, I’m afraid,” said Bart, in a despondent\r\ntone. “If we only had half a fluke I wouldn’t care; but as it is, we\r\nhave no fluke at all, and that’s why we can’t do anything.”\r\n\r\nWaiting thus, and wondering what they could do next, the three boys\r\nlooked sadly toward the receding shore. The quilts which they had thrown\r\naround them had been fastened at the waist with rope-yarns, and\r\nthese, in the exercise of letting go the anchor, had fallen from their\r\nshoulders, leaving them exposed from their waists upward. They looked\r\nruefully at one another as they thought of this, burst out laughing, and\r\nthen drew the quilts, toga fashion, over their shoulders again.\r\n\r\n“It was bad enough this morning,” said Arthur, at last, “but it was a\r\njoke to this. What can we do for something to eat?”\r\n\r\n“There’s not a morsel on board.”\r\n\r\n“The last mouthful of bread we ate before we waded ashore.”\r\n\r\n“If we only had a fish-hook we might hope to catch something.”\r\n\r\n“Fish-hook! Why, man, we haven’t any kind of bait.”\r\n\r\n“Well, all we’ve got to do is to hope for some one to pick us up.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all? No,” said Bart. “I, for one, am not going to sit down\r\nand float away, goodness knows where. I move that we up sail and go\r\nsomewhere.”\r\n\r\n“Up sail!”\r\n\r\n“Of course. Why not?”\r\n\r\n“But can we--can you--?”\r\n\r\n“O, we can scrape along. I’d rather have a small accident than drift\r\noff in this style, doing nothing. You all understand my knowledge of\r\nsailing, for you’ve had a fair specimen of it, and if you’re willing\r\nto risk my steering again, I’m ready to take hold; if not, then you\r\nor Bruce take hold, and I’ll keep at the sails. It don’t make any\r\ndifference, though, which of us is captain, for I suppose one knows just\r\nas much as another. But, at any rate, I’m bound to have the sails up.”\r\n\r\n“So am I,” cried Bruce, “whatever happens.”\r\n\r\n“And I too!” cried Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Bart, you be captain, old fellow. We won’t take your office from you.\r\nYou’ve had more experience than we have had, at any rate, for you’ve\r\nsteered her already. But we must get up the piece of an anchor first.”\r\n\r\n“Of course we must, and the sooner the better.”\r\n\r\nUpon this they all went to work at the windlass. It was hard work, but\r\nafter some time it was successfully accomplished. By this time they had\r\ndrifted out several miles, and the beach still lay before them, but it\r\nwas faint in the distance. The headland was then somewhat toward the\r\nright, and this served as an excellent guide. The vessel’s head was\r\nstill turned toward the shore, in the way in which she had drifted out.\r\n\r\n“My idea,” said Bart, “is, that we sail straight back again.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity we hadn’t the other fellows on board,” said Bruce, “for we\r\nmight try some place where there might be houses.”\r\n\r\n“Well, in that case, I’d give you the helm,” said Bart. “As long as I’m\r\nhere, I will only go where I know my ground. I don’t care to try the\r\nFive Islands again, nor would I like to turn the schooner. It’s lucky\r\nfor us that she’s heading in shore. So come, boys, let’s hurry up with\r\nthe sails, or else she may turn off in some other direction; and then\r\nhow we can get her round again, will be more than I can say.”\r\n\r\nHoisting the sails was arduous work, but they succeeded. The wind had\r\nmoderated, and the vessel glided slowly back toward the beach. Bart was\r\nso anxious to rejoin Tom and Phil, that he did not venture to try any\r\nexperiments in sailing, but simply kept the schooner’s head toward the\r\nplace where he supposed they might be standing. The wind was favorable,\r\nthe vessel drew nearer and nearer, and at last the beach again became\r\ndistinctly visible.\r\n\r\nA shout of joy escaped them as they recognized Phil and Tom again.\r\n\r\n“I wonder how they felt when they saw us drifting,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“They must have given us up for lost.”\r\n\r\n“1 wonder whether they expected that we would raise the sails.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe they thought of that.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not surprising, after all; especially as we didn’t think of it\r\nourselves till the last moment.”\r\n\r\n“That’s odd, too. It seems now as though it ought to have been the very\r\nfirst thing to think of.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the fact is, we had such a tough time this morning off that\r\nheadland,” said Bart, pointing to the dark rocks which were full before\r\nthem on their right, “that it’s no wonder if we gave up all ideas of\r\never hoisting sail again. However, it’s all right. And now what ought we\r\nto do?”\r\n\r\n“There’s only one thing that we can do.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“What? Why, what else can we do but run ashore, just as we did\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose we can’t do anything else; but it’s a pity, too. Still we\r\nmust take Tom and Phil. Though, if they were on board, we could at least\r\nfind a better part of the coast. This is so remote, and I haven’t seen\r\nany houses near the place at all.”\r\n\r\nBad as it was, there was no help for it; and so Bart had to keep the\r\nschooner straight on. On account of the currents, however, and the\r\nloss of way, the Antelope could not come within a mile of her former\r\nlanding-place. Phil and Tom saw this, and ran down the beach, carrying\r\nthe bundles; and just as they came opposite to their companions, the\r\nAntelope grounded about a hundred feet from the beach. Without waiting\r\nanother instant, Phil and Tom threw off their clothes, and waded out.\r\nThey got on board without any adventures, and celebrated the restoration\r\nof their companions by dancing like wild creatures about the deck. Long\r\nexplanations followed from both sides, after which they discussed their\r\nfuture prospects.\r\n\r\n“Hallo!” said Arthur, as the schooner sank a little on one side. “She’s\r\naground. No farther drifting till next tide. And now what can we do, or\r\nwhere can we fasten her?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to try and use the chain and line, as we did before.”.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if we are not too far out.”\r\n\r\n“No; I think not,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“There’s a good stump up there to fasten a line to,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“I dare say we can get a line up. If not, we can bury the anchor in the\r\nmud, and put stones over it.”\r\n\r\n“And what can we do about exploring the country?”\r\n\r\n“Some of us must stay by the schooner to attend to the fastenings.”\r\n\r\n“Two can stay, and three go.”\r\n\r\n“No, three had better stay, and two go. It’s too hard work.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! two will be enough. But who will they be?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we must toss up for it. That’s the only plan. We must do it at\r\nonce. There’s no time to lose.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose, before we do anything more,” said Bart, “that we all slip\r\nashore and put our clothes on. For my part, I’m chilly; and though I\r\ncould easily get some more quilts, yet it seems unnecessary to do so\r\nwhen I have my own clothes so near. Besides, here are Phil and Tom,\r\nwhose teeth are already chattering.”\r\n\r\nA loud laugh followed; after which they all sprang, one after the other,\r\ninto the water, and hurried to the shore. There they dressed themselves;\r\nand as the vessel was fairly aground, with the tide rapidly going out\r\npast her, they threw themselves on the beach, and prepared to decide on\r\nthe ones that would stay behind.\r\n\r\n“There!” cried Phil, suddenly springing to his feet. “I knew it was!”\r\n\r\n“What? what?” exclaimed all the others.\r\n\r\n“A sail!--out there by the headland!”\r\n\r\n“So it is,” said Bart. “Phil, you’ve got a good pair of eyes in your\r\nhead.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a sail-boat,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“And heading this way,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Tom. “They’ve come for us at last.”\r\n\r\n“Come, now, boys,” said Arthur, “don’t let us get excited again. I tell\r\nyou that boat is some fisherman, and it is passing by here. Those on\r\nboard won’t see us, and there’s no use doing anything. Let’s sit down\r\nand finish the toss-up, and send Phil to the top of the bank to watch,\r\nand make what signals he can.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it!” cried Bart; and springing forward, he dashed into the\r\nwater toward the schooner with his clothes on. The water had fallen so\r\nfar, however, that he did not get wet much above his knees. Clambering\r\non board, he lowered the flag of the “B. O. W. C.,”--which had waved\r\nthere through all their vicissitudes,--and tearing off his red flannel\r\nshirt, he fastened it close beneath the flag. Then he pulled it up\r\nand then kept lowering and hoisting, with the utmost rapidity, the\r\nextraordinary signal. Nor was this all. He had not yet lost confidence\r\nin his pistol, in spite of its signal failure in the case of the\r\nschooner some time before, but drew it forth now with a certain solemn\r\ndecision. By this time all the others had come on board, and were waving\r\nall sorts of quilts and blankets from the stern. In the midst of all\r\nthis agitation Bart fired his pistol. The smart pop! rang out bravely\r\nenough; but as the sail-boat was at least three miles away, it cannot be\r\nsaid to have produced any very extraordinary result. Bart, however,\r\nwas satisfied. He had already given charge of the “ensign” to Tom, and,\r\nstanding on the starboard quarter, he fired again. After this he rested\r\nfor a while, and waited for the boat to come nearer.\r\n\r\nNearer she was certainly coming, in spite of the scepticism of Arthur.\r\nTo guard against the pain of disappointment, Arthur was trying, with all\r\nhis might, not to hope, and to prevent any of the others from hoping.\r\nYet he could not help being as sanguine as the others, in spite of his\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” he cried, “be careful now. Remember this boat don’t see us, and\r\ndon’t intend to. She’s a fishing-boat, out after sturgeon. She’s sailing\r\nstraight across, past us, to--Hurrah! here she comes straight down to\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha, ha! Hurrah! She sees us! Up and down with the flag, Tom! Fire\r\naway, Bart! Bring up that fog-horn, somebody, and blow till you burst.\r\nI’ll content myself with a sociable yell.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon a yell, so loud, so harsh, so penetrating, burst forth from\r\nBruce, that it seemed to penetrate even to the boat. White signals\r\ncertainly were waving from those on board, and a tall figure in black\r\nstood upright in the bows waving a hat.\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” cried Bart, as he fired his pistol again, and danced joyously\r\nabout. “And you call that a fishing-boat, do you, Arthur? So you\r\nthink the fishermen here go out to throw their nets, dressed in black\r\nbroadcloth and silk hats, do you? Well, I call that good. A fisherman!\r\nWho would think of Mr. Long being taken for a fisherman!”\r\n\r\nAll was now the wildest joy. There was no more doubt, and no longer any\r\nmistakes. The boat saw them, and had returned answer to their signals.\r\nIt was bearing swiftly down toward them. It was filled with people. Who\r\nwere they all?\r\n\r\nThe question was soon answered. Nearer came the boat, and nearer, and\r\nstill-nearer. At last it came close up, and grounded under the vessel’s\r\nquarter. Mr. Long was first on board, wringing all the boys’ hands, and\r\npretending to scold them. After him came Mr. Simmons, then Bogud, then\r\nBillymack, then the two captains. Hearty was the greeting, and deep and\r\nfervent the joy, at finding that all had turned out so well. The “B. O.\r\nW. C.” had to tell all about their adventures. They concealed nothing\r\nwhatever. Bart related, with the utmost frankness, the story of his\r\nnavigation experiments, interrupted by the laughter of the other boys,\r\nand the criticisms of Captain Corbet, who would insist on explaining\r\nwhat ought to have been done. Then followed the story of the\r\n“shovel-mouth shark,” which produced an immense sensation. Captain\r\nCorbet shook his head solemnly at the sight of the jaws, which Phil had\r\nrun ashore to get. But their last adventure, when they were drifted away\r\nfrom their clothes, was considered about the most singular of all.\r\n\r\n“But how did you manage to find us?” asked Bart, as he ended his story.\r\n\r\nMr. Long related all about his first discovery of their accident up to\r\nthe time that he had left with his party for the “pint.”\r\n\r\n“When we got there,” continued he, “we saw a schooner sailing, and made\r\nit out with the glass to be the Antelope. We watched you as you sailed\r\ntoward the Five Islands. You must have been on your second tack then.\r\nWe could not imagine where you were going. Captain Corbet thought you\r\ndidn’t know your way. I thought you were letting the vessel go wherever\r\nthe wind might take you. As it happens, I was not very far wrong.\r\n\r\n“At last we saw you turn, and the performance of the schooner showed\r\nus all very plainly that you couldn’t sail her. It filled us with\r\nthe deepest anxiety. We could have got a boat, but your course was so\r\nstrange, that we delayed until we could see where you might finally\r\nbring up. We didn’t expect any accident exactly, but hoped that you\r\nwould come nearer. At last you sailed so close to that headland that we\r\nthought you were lost. Immediately afterward you passed behind it from\r\nsight. We waited some time to see if you would reappear, but you did\r\nnot. So we at once put off in the boat which belonged to a fisherman who\r\nlived near, and came here as fast as possible. The last time that you\r\ndrifted off we saw you; but perhaps you were too excited to see us--or\r\nperhaps we were too far off to be seen very easily.\r\n\r\n“And now,” concluded Mr. Long, “I’ve found you again, and it’s my fixed\r\ndetermination not to let any of you go out of my sight. You’re all a set\r\nof Jonahs. The only comfort is, that you come out all right at last.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure, Mr. Long,” remonstrated Bart, “you oughtn’t to blame us. It\r\nwasn’t our fault. I’d much rather not drift away if I could help it. I\r\ndon’t enjoy going about in the fog, or among these tides. I’m sure Bruce\r\ndon’t. Neither does Arthur, nor Tom, nor Phil.”\r\n\r\n“Blame you? Of course I don’t blame you,” said Mr. Long. “How can I? It\r\nwasn’t your fault, of course. I only mean that your fortunes have been\r\nvery peculiar. I don’t know but, if I believed in omens, I’d say that\r\nyour black flag up there has brought us all this run of bad luck. But\r\ncome, we’ve been thoughtful about you. We knew you’d be starving, and so\r\nwe brought along with us something for you to eat.”\r\n\r\n“Starving! Mr. Long, we’re in that condition that we could eat\r\nhorseshoes.”\r\n\r\nWith a good-natured laugh, Mr. Long turned away, and jumping into the\r\nboat, handed up the eatables that he had brought for them..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n_Wanderings about the Beach.--Science and Sport.--Back Home.--Frightful\r\nTale of Poison.--A Visit to the Afflicted._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE eatables which Mr. Long had brought with him were not such as would\r\nhave been welcome to a fastidious taste or a dainty appetite; but to\r\nthese long-fasting, hard-working, and half-starving, and altogether\r\nravenous boys, anything that was eatable was precious. The brown\r\nship-bread and salt pork, which Mr. Long handed up to them, were seized\r\nas eagerly as if they had been roast beef and plum pudding, and soon\r\ndisposed of. A knife drawn from Phil’s belt served very quickly to\r\ncut the pork into slices, after which the pork and the brown biscuit\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n“What a pity,” said Mr. Long, as he looked around, “that we didn’t\r\nget here an hour earlier! The water’s going out fast; the schooner is\r\naground, and we’ll have to wait till the next tide before we can start\r\nfor the cove.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity that we can’t do something while waiting, so as not to\r\nthrow our time away,” said Mr. Simmons.\r\n\r\n“There don’t seem to be much prospect of doing anything just here, but\r\nwe can try.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do I see that there are any people living about here.”\r\n\r\n“No: Captain Corbet told me there were no inhabitants within eight\r\nmiles.”\r\n\r\n“These banks are not very inviting to a mineralogist--are they?” said\r\nMr. Simmons, with a sigh, as he looked along the beach.\r\n\r\n“No; we’ll have to lay out our strength on the mud flats. Perhaps we may\r\nfind some interesting footprints at low tide.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we may as well go ashore now, I suppose. It’s rather monotonous\r\nstanding here on an inclined plane, with the vessel aground on her side.\r\nI think I’ll climb the bank, and take a general view of the country.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; I’ll go with you,” said Mr. Long. “And now, boys,” he\r\ncontinued, “remember this: don’t go out of sight. This beach is long,\r\nand it will soon be wide, for the tide will leave it all uncovered.\r\nThis will give space enough for even such extensive and wide-spreading\r\ndesires as yours. Now, don’t go off the beach or the flats. Don’t go up\r\nin the woods, and get lost; don’t go into the water, and get drowned;\r\ndon’t blow yourselves up with that pistol; don’t get into any more\r\nfights with ‘shovel-mouth sharks,’ or, if you do, be sure to call me;\r\ndon’t get into air-holes if you can help it. As to going adrift again, I\r\ndon’t see how you can manage that, as there is nothing afloat just yet;\r\nbut, dear hoys, if you can possibly help it, don’t do it. Try and see if\r\nyou can’t manage’ to keep your clothes on. It’s much better, as a\r\ngeneral thing, to do so.”\r\n\r\nAll this the hoys greeted with loud laughter; after which they sprang\r\nover the vessel’s side, and scattered themselves along the beach.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stood looking after them, with a beaming smile\r\nirradiating his venerable countenance.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he ejaculated, standing near Mr. Long. “Yes, sir; I allus knowed\r\nit, an’ I allus said it, that them there boys would turn up all right.\r\nLor’ bless your heart, you can’t wreck ’em, an’ you can’t drown ’em.\r\nThe fish doesn’t swim that can tetch ’em. They’re allus bound to turn\r\nup all straight. That’s the confidin’ belief that reigned in my boosom,\r\nan’ sustained me when we watched, ’em in the Antelope, up there at the\r\npint. As to that there anchor, ef it had been a bran new one, it would\r\nhave been broken off jest the same, for that there schooner was bound to\r\nlie on it an’ crack it, an’ them there boys was bound to have that there\r\nadventoor.”\r\n\r\nMr. Long now landed with Mr. Simmons, and went up to the top of the\r\nbank, where they sat down for some time, gazing upon the wide-spread\r\nscenery of the Basin of Minas. After this they descended and walked\r\nabout the beach. At first, they hoped to obtain some shells; but nothing\r\nof the kind could be found. In fact, there were scarcely any pebbles;\r\nindeed, none but the most common kind. For all the waters of the Bay of\r\nFundy and its adjacent harbors are singularly bare of the more delicate\r\nshell-fish. Lobsters abound, and so do clams; so also do many kinds of\r\nseaweed; but as for the more exquisite forms of sea life, such as we\r\nlove to put in the aquarium, they must be sought for elsewhere. Here\r\nare swift currents, fierce rapids, strong tides, vast mud flats or sand\r\nflats, rivers that empty and fill themselves with every ebb and flood;\r\nand it is not amid such scenes that we may look for those graceful, yet\r\nfragile creatures,-whose abode is amid stiller scenes.\r\n\r\nAs the tide went down, Messrs. Simmons and Long walked over the flats,\r\nhoping to find something which would reward their trouble. From the\r\nsurface of the sea bottom thus uncovered, many interesting things might\r\nbe obtained. On these mud flats are found many marks, which are the\r\ncounterparts of others that have been turned into stone, and buried in\r\nthe adjacent earth. Here may be seen the patter of rain-drops, and the\r\nfootprints of birds or beasts made on the very day of their discovery,\r\nwhile among the strata of the neighboring shore there may lie traces of\r\na similar kind made many ages ago, which thus have been graven on the\r\nrock, and treasured up for our eyes.\r\n\r\nThe boys dispersed themselves everywhere, extending their wanderings as\r\nthe tide left more and more of the shore exposed. Far down they could\r\nsee the weirs, placed there by the fishermen, and they waited long for\r\nthese to become uncovered, so that they might visit them, and inspect\r\ntheir contents. But it grew later and later, and finally it became too\r\ndark to do anything. Then the voice of Mr. Long was heard summoning them\r\nto the shore.\r\n\r\nThus the remainder of the day passed without anything to reward them\r\nexcept the general excitement which had been produced among them. It\r\nwould be many hours yet before they could get afloat, and they amused\r\nthemselves by making fires at the foot of the bank. A modest and frugal\r\nrepast of brown biscuit and pork, washed down with cold water, concluded\r\nthe day. For some time longer they sat round the fire, until, at last,\r\nexcessive weariness overcame them. Then they went on board the schooner,\r\nand retired to bed.\r\n\r\nSome time after midnight the Antelope was afloat again. None of her\r\npassengers waked. She moved away from the shore without accident.\r\nMorning came, and she had not yet reached her destination. The wind had\r\nbeen unfavorable, and she had lost that tide. As she could not anchor,\r\nCaptain Corbet had run her ashore. They had to wait patiently, and get\r\noff at midday, with the rising tide; after which they resumed their\r\nvoyage, and in three hours more they were in Captain Pratt’s house.\r\n\r\nOf the five boys who had been left behind, one was not visible, and the\r\nother four met them with pale, woe-begone faces. They showed no joy at\r\nseeing the return of the wanderers; no curiosity to learn what they had\r\nbeen doing; and even the sight of the jaw of the “shovel-mouth shark”\r\n produced upon them no effect whatever.\r\n\r\nIt was seen that something had happened, and the unhappy four were\r\nclosely cross-questioned. At first they refused to answer. At last, on\r\nbeing pressed, they confessed that they had all been poisoned.\r\n\r\n“Poisoned!” cried Bart, in horror. “How was that?”\r\n\r\n“_Clams!!!_” said Jiggins.\r\n\r\n“Yes, clams!” said all the others.\r\n\r\n“Clams?” cried Bart. “What rubbish! How could clams poison you! Pooh!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you don’t know,” said Jiggins. “You ask Mrs. Pratt. Haven’t you\r\nheard the old saying,” he continued, with an air of peculiar solemnity;\r\n“the old saying, that they have about these shores:”\r\n\r\n                   “’ In the months without the “R,”\r\n\r\n                   Clams and oysters poison are?’”\r\n\r\n“Never heard it,” said Bart; “and I don’t believe it. I’ve eaten lots of\r\noysters in May myself.”\r\n\r\nJiggins shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Never do it again,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that it was clams that upset you so?”\r\n\r\n“Clams, and clams alone,” said Jiggins. “We owe our lives to Mrs. Pratt.\r\nShe’s been a mother to us.”\r\n\r\n“Why! What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“You see we had a stew. Pat ate them raw, and fell down in horrible\r\nagonies. The torments which he suffered were so excruciating that he had\r\nto be carried to the house, and went nearly mad with pain. Mrs. Pratt\r\nattended him, and as soon as he was easier she took us in hand. We had\r\neaten after Pat, and our pains had not yet begun. Mrs. Pratt got out all\r\nher medicines, and tried them on us one after the other.”\r\n\r\n“What! not all! not _all_ her medicines!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, _all!_” said Jiggins, in a dismal voice. “I can’t tell you all\r\nthat we took; but first there was opodeldoc, then ginger, then Crabb’s\r\ncordial, then magnesia, then paregoric, then blue pills, then a mustard\r\nplaster, after which there was rum and onions, brimstone and molasses--”\r\n\r\n“Stop, stop!” cried Bart. “What’s all that? You don’t mean to say that\r\nyou took all that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, _all!_” ejaculated. Jiggins, his face growing at once longer and\r\npaler at the recollection of hiss sorrows.\r\n\r\n“And you’re alive yet--all of you? Then you need never be afraid of\r\npoisons. Yes my poor Jiggins, you have been poisoned; that’s a fact,\r\nthough not by clams.”\r\n\r\nMr. Long, who was present, had listened to all this in consternation.\r\n\r\n“And where’s Pat?” he asked. That young gentleman’s name was Michael,\r\nbut everybody called him Pat, and so did Mr. Long. “And where’s Pat?”\r\n\r\n“In bed yet, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Pat! Has he been dosed, too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; but he was taken worse than any of us;” and with this Jiggins\r\nwent on to tell all about Pat and the raw clams.\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear, dear!” cried Mr. Long. “He must have eaten a bushel, and\r\nall raw. Dear, dear, dear! What did he think he was made of? O, how is\r\nit possible for me to keep you all out of mischief? I go after one half\r\nof you who are in peril, and come back to find the rest of you half\r\npoisoned. But poor Pat--where is he? I must see him, for we have to\r\nstart for home to-night.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll show you, sir,” said Jiggins; and he took him to the room where\r\nPat was. He was lying in bed, looking pale and exhausted. He greeted Mr.\r\nLong with a faint smile, and the kind-hearted teacher did his utmost to\r\nsoothe the afflicted boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n_Complaints of a disappointed Savant.--The humble Confession of Pat.--A\r\nburied Treasure, and a great Search after it by Torchlight’._\r\n\r\n\r\n“PAT,” said Mr. Long, kindly, “do you think you will be able to start\r\nto-night?”\r\n\r\n“To-night, sir?” said Pat, dolefully. “Yes, the recess is over. Our time\r\nis up, and we must all be back to-morrow. We ought to have been there\r\nSaturday night. Do you think you can come?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I’ll have to, sir.”\r\n\r\n“If you’re too weak, or if it pains you to walk, we can carry you down,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\n“What time are ye afther lavin’ at, sir?”\r\n\r\n“About one o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“O, thin, surely I’ll be betther by that time,” said Pat. “I’ll get a\r\nwink of sleep, and wake up meself again.”.\r\n\r\n“Do so, Pat. Is there anything I could get you?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, thank ye kindly. I don’t know of anything.”\r\n\r\nYes, they had to go back, for their time was up; yet Mr. Long was in\r\ndespair, not knowing what to do about the minerals. He was confident\r\nthat they were somewhere--but where? No one knew, and he couldn’t\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\n“It’s too bad,” he cried, as his indignation grew irrepressible. “It’s\r\ntoo bad. Our expedition has been ill organized. I don’t blame anybody,\r\nbut we’ve certainly had very bad luck. With only a week we have wasted\r\nor lost every day but one. Last Monday we were kept all day and all\r\nnight at the wharf.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, Mr. Long,” said Captain Corbet, “I s’pose you’re kind o’ blamin’\r\nme; but what could I do? Ef a man has a babby, mustn’t he nuss it?”\r\n\r\n“No, he musn’t,” said Mr. Long; “he must make his wife attend to\r\nhousehold matters, and keep his engagements.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stared with a look of horror and astonishment at Mr.\r\nLong.\r\n\r\n“Wal, sir,” he said, with modest firmness, “in my humble opinion, sir,\r\na babby is a babby, an’ flesh an’ blood is flesh an’ blood; an’ I\r\ndon’t care who says they ain’t. Ef you’d see that there babby, sir,”\r\n he continued, warming up in a glow of fond parental feeling,--“ef you’d\r\na-seen that there babby, as I’ve seen him,--a crowin’, an’ a pullin’ of\r\nmy har, an’ a sayin’, Ga-ga-ga,--‘you’d--\r\n\r\n“Mr. Simmons,” said Mr. Long, suddenly, “have you hunted for the\r\nstones?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“And did you find nothing?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“There it is,” resumed Mr. Long. “A whole week worse than lost. We lost\r\nMonday. We started Tuesday, and sailed nearly all day. We had about\r\ntwo hours’ work, and then the boat went adrift. All Wednesday wo were\r\nwandering about the bay. Thursday came, and we didn’t find the boys till\r\nthe day was well gone, and then stopping at O’Rafferty’s and coming here\r\ntook up the remainder of the time.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we had Friday to ourselves,” said Mr. Simmons, with a pleasant\r\nsmile. He was an amiable man, and always looked on the bright side of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we had,” said Mr. Long, “but unfortunately we accomplished\r\nnothing. We had a long journey, and came back empty-handed.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate, we had the time.”\r\n\r\n“But that time was lost.”\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said Mr. Simmons, “it was one of those days which everybody\r\nmust expect to have. We tried hard, but were unsuccessful. I don’t,\r\nby any means, call such a day lost. We gave ourselves up thoroughly to\r\nscience.”\r\n\r\n“Well, call it a well-spent day,” said Mr. Long, “and what of it? We\r\nwill count it in; but after that--what? Saturday came, and we had to go\r\nafter the boys again; now our time’s up, and to-night we must go back\r\nagain. We have had a week; and out of it we have been able to spend, at\r\nthe very utmost, only one day and two hours. Well. I don’t know how it\r\nstrikes you, but I call it hard.”\r\n\r\n“It would, indeed, have been hard if things had turned out as we\r\nfeared,” said Mr. Simmons.\r\n\r\n“O, of course I feel all that. I am only lamenting that these accidents\r\nshould have happened, and that, when we came for a certain purpose, we\r\nshould have been unable to carry it out. And see how things have gone\r\non. We are out of provisions, and have to lay in a stock of meal, and\r\nmolasses, and pork.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure, meal makes very good food,” said Mr. Simmons. “Hot corn-cake\r\nis rather a delicacy, and molasses is very good to eat with it.”\r\n\r\n“After all, I don’t care anything about these things,” continued Mr.\r\nLong. “What I do care about is the loss of the minerals.”\r\n\r\n“O, they’re not lost.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they are. No one knows anything about them. No one has seen them.\r\nNo one can find them. They’re lost, Mr. Simmons, beyond the possibility\r\nof redemption.”\r\n\r\n“O, I hope not.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m going to make a final search. Captain Pratt has asked every\r\nman, woman, and child in the place, but no one knows anything about\r\nthem.. I’m now going to question every one over again. I’ve asked\r\nCaptain Corbet already. He knows nothing. Captain Corbet, where’s the\r\nmate?”\r\n\r\n“Sound asleep in the barn, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll go out and ask him.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet went out with him, and after much trouble they roused\r\nthe sleeper, who, however, could tell them nothing whatever about the\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Long asked all the boys in succession. He had asked them once\r\nbefore, but he was determined to try it again. There was no result. No.\r\none knew anything about it. At last, all had been examined but Pat. Mr.\r\nLong felt sorry for him, and would have left him untroubled; but his\r\nintense desire to investigate thoroughly was too strong, and’ so he\r\nresolved to ask him.\r\n\r\nPat was trying to get some sleep, and with very little success. Mr. Long\r\nasked him kindly about his feelings, and spoke cheerfully to him for a\r\nfew moments. At length he asked him,--\r\n\r\n“Pat, I had two baskets of specimens, and they’ve been lost. Do you know\r\nanything about them?”\r\n\r\n“Two baskets of what, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Specimens.”\r\n\r\n“Spicimins, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What are spicimins, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Why, mineralogical specimens. Minerals, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Minerals? Sorra a one o’ me knows what that same is,’ sir. I never saw\r\none in my life.”\r\n\r\n“Never saw a mineral? Nonsense! What we were gathering on the island--”\r\n\r\n“Gatherin’? Was it minerals, then?” said Pat. “Is it anythin’ like\r\no’--like shrimps, sir?”\r\n\r\nMr. Long laughed. He knew Pat’s wonderful ignorance about some things,\r\nbut he was hardly prepared for this. As for Pat, the poor fellow found\r\nhe had made a mistake, and colored violently from shame and vexation.\r\n\r\n“Do you really mean to say that you don’t know what minerals are?” asked\r\nMr. Long.\r\n\r\n“Sorra a bit of it thin, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well, they look like little stones. Didn’t you see us breaking little\r\npieces from the rocks?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t notice, sir.”\r\n\r\n“That’s no way to do, Pat. You ought to keep your eyes open, or you’ll\r\nnever learn anything.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, these minerals looked like common little stones. They were\r\nin two baskets. Each one was carefully wrapped in paper. Now those two\r\nbaskets of stones are missing, and I can’t find out anything about them.\r\nI want you to try and remember if you’ve seen anything of that kind, or\r\nif you’ve seen any little bits of paper that may have been around them.\r\nDo you understand? Little stones, you know.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Long smiled encouragingly, so to give Pat a chance to collect\r\nhis thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Little stones?” faltered Pat, as there flashed over him an awful\r\nsuspicion that he had done an irreparable mischief to somebody, and to\r\nMr. Long in particular. “Little stones, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Pat, little stones. Dirty little stones. You might have seen them,\r\nand would suppose that many of them were worthless, unless they were\r\nwrapped in paper and carefully packed.”\r\n\r\n“Dirty little stones, sir?” said Pat, in an imbecile way.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“And aich one wrapped in paper, sir?” said Pat, whose voice died away\r\ninto a mournful wail, while he cast an imploring glance at Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“Yes..Tell me,” cried Mr. Long, “have you seen them?”\r\n\r\n“I have, sir,” said Pat, dolefully.\r\n\r\n“When? where? Where are they now? Where did you put them?”\r\n\r\n“I--I--” He hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Quick! It’s late. I want to get them. You brought them to the house, I\r\nsuppose; or did you put them on board of the vessel?”\r\n\r\n“I--I--”\r\n\r\n“Well, why don’t you tell me what you did with them?”\r\n\r\n“O, sir, it’s heart-broken I am this minute, sir! It’s fairly dead wid\r\ngrafe I am, sir! You’ll niver forgive me! an’ I’m afraid to tell you,\r\nsir.”\r\n\r\n“What? What’s all this? What have you been doing? What is it?” said Mr.\r\nLong, sternly.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, I thought it was a trick, sir, that the boys played on me,\r\nsir; and I pitched them over the mud into the bank, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You what!” cried Mr. Long, in an awful voice. Hereupon Pat, with many\r\nsighs and tears, and entreaties for pardon, told him all. Mr. Long heard\r\nhim through without a word. Then he asked minutely about the spot where\r\nthey had been thrown. After this he rushed from the house down to\r\nthe point. The tide was down below that place, leaving the mud flat\r\nuncovered. The sun was just setting. Mr. Long stared wildly about.\r\n\r\nThere was not a trace of a Single specimen; for the heavy stones had\r\nsunk in, and the soft ooze and slimy mud, closing over them, had shut\r\nthem from sight.\r\n\r\nMr. Long looked around in despair. He had hoped that he might recover\r\nsome of them, but was not prepared to see all traces of them obliterated\r\nso completely. Besides, to add to his disappointment, the sun set before\r\nhe had begun anything like a search; and the shadows of evening came\r\non rapidly. What was he to do? Could he thus give up the results of his\r\nexpedition, and consent to lose those precious specimens for which he\r\nhad done so much? The thought was intolerable. He would go back and\r\ninterrogate Pat afresh. It was possible that Pat had directed him to\r\nthe wrong place. It was scarcely possible that every stone could have\r\nvanished so completely, if this were really the place where Pat had\r\nthrown them.\r\n\r\nSuch were Mr. Long’s thoughts and hopes, under the stimulus of which he\r\nat length retreated from the bank and returned to the house. Thus far\r\nhe had kept Pat’s performance a secret, out of consideration for Pat\r\nhimself; for he was not willing that so glaring a case of dense and\r\nutter ignorance should be made public. But now he was compelled to tell\r\nit to all of them, so as to get their assistance in the search; so,\r\nafter once more questioning Pat, and getting from him fresh particulars\r\nabout the place where he had thrown the stones, and finding, to his\r\ndismay, that it was no other than the very place where he had been, he\r\nwent to summon the rest’ of the boys.\r\n\r\nGathering them together, Mr. Long began to unfold to them the fate of\r\nthe long sought for, but still missing, stones. As he began, his native\r\ngenerosity made him desirous of sparing poor Pat; but as he proceeded,\r\nthe sense of his own wrongs overcame the dictates of generosity. He\r\nconcealed nothing, he kept back nothing, he palliated nothing. All was\r\nmade known. Finally, he implored the assistance of every one of them in\r\nfinding the lost treasures.\r\n\r\nOf course, after such an appeal, there was no chance for refusal; and so\r\nthey at once prepared to follow him. Bart insisted on procuring\r\ntorches, and his inventive genius readily suggested an excellent mode\r\nof obtaining light. This was by stripping the inflammable bark from the\r\nhuge piles of birch firewood that lay near the house; and folding these\r\nup in compact scroll-like sticks. A large number of these were made; and\r\nwith these, with lanterns, and with pine knots, the whole band followed\r\nMr. Long to the bank. Here they took off their shoes and stockings, and\r\nprepared for their task.\r\n\r\nThe mud on the surface was very soft to the depth of several inches,\r\nand into this they sank; but sinking thus far, they found a hard clay\r\nbottom. Proceeding in this way, they all sought with earnest scrutiny\r\nfor signs of the buried stones. For some time nothing could be found.\r\nAt last, with a cry of delight, Bogud plunged his hand into the mud, and\r\ndrew out something, with which he instantly hurried to Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“Here’s one of them!” said he.\r\n\r\nHe held out a lump, at which Mr. Long and all the rest eagerly looked.\r\nIt seemed more like a small lump of mud or clay than anything else.\r\n\r\nSo they all said.\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said they; “a little lump of clay.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not clay,” said Bogud; “it’s the amethyst. I know it by the way\r\nit feels. It’s covered with mud, though, and ought to be washed\r\nimmediately.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he rubbed the clinging mud with his fingers, disclosing at\r\nlast something with an oval surface and a dirty-gray color.\r\n\r\n“It’s the amethyst,” repeated Bogud, triumphantly. “I know it by the\r\noval back. I picked the amethyst myself. Wait till I get the rest of the\r\nmud off. See here!--but--what--hallo!”\r\n\r\nHis confident tones ceased, and changed to an exclamation of doubt, then\r\ndisgust. The boys had crowded around to see the exhumed treasure, and to\r\ncatch the secret of Bogud’s luck. As he held it forth and wiped off the\r\nlast lump of mud that adhered to its edge, it stood revealed to all.\r\n\r\n“A clam! a clam! a clam!” was the instantaneous shout, followed by a\r\npeal of laughter.\r\n\r\nIn fact, so it proved. It was a clam-shell filled with mud which Bogud\r\nhad drawn forth so triumphantly.\r\n\r\nAfter this they sought for some time longer. It was a striking scene.\r\nThe boys without shoes, with their trousers drawn up above the knee,\r\nwith their torches flashing through the shades of evening, as they\r\nwere waved overhead, with the flakes which fell every instant from the\r\ntorches into the mud, with their laughter, and noise, and jesting,--all\r\nformed a scene in the highest degree wild and picturesque.\r\n\r\nBut the search was useless. Perhaps the finding of the clam disheartened\r\nthem; perhaps it was really not possible to find what they sought.\r\nAt any rate, after half an hour, even Mr. Long himself despaired, and\r\ncalled off all the boys to return to the house.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n_How to waken a Sleeper.--Off Home.--A weary Way.--Baffled like the\r\nFlying Dutchman.--Corbet pines for his Bobby.--“The Wind at last!\r\nHurrah!”_\r\n\r\n\r\nAT midnight the whole party left Captain Pratt’s, in order to make\r\npreparations for embarking in the Antelope, as soon as the tide would\r\nserve. Pat had regained very much of his former strength and spirits;\r\nthe pain had, in a great measure, left him, and the reaction from his\r\nmisery exhibited itself in occasional peals of wild laughter, which\r\nbroke very strangely upon the silence of the night. He was quite able to\r\nwalk down, and joked with the other boys about his mishap. Trouble\r\nhad been anticipated in getting him down to the vessel; but the\r\nanticipations, which had proved baseless in regard to him, were more\r\nthan realized in the case of the mate. This worthy had spent almost all\r\nthe time in sleeping on Captain Pratt’s haymow; and now, when the time\r\nhad come for departure, it was found absolutely impossible to rouse him.\r\nAt ten o’clock, Captain Corbet had called him, but with no result.\r\nThen he had used other modes of rousing him, which had all ended in a\r\nfailure. Mr. Long had exerted himself, and with a like result. As a\r\nlast resort, he had commissioned the hoys to do what they could toward\r\nrousing the slumberer. They very willingly undertook the commission.\r\nRanging themselves round him, they kept up a prolonged shake at his\r\nshoulder, his head, and his feet. By this means they succeeded in\r\nrousing him so far that he would utter words in a dreary way in answer\r\nto their cries.\r\n\r\n“Get up! Get up!”\r\n\r\n“Ye-e-e-e-e-e-s,” was the reply, ending in a long snore.\r\n\r\n“Get up! Hi, hi, hi!”\r\n\r\n“In--a--mi--i--i--n’t.”\r\n\r\n“Hallo! Up! Get up! The schooner’s off!”\r\n\r\n“Hey?”\r\n\r\n“The schooner’s off!”\r\n\r\n“Hm-m-m--”\r\n\r\n“Here! No sleeping! Get up! You shan’t sleep any more! Get up!” and amid\r\nloud cries and yells the recumbent form was shaken from head to foot.\r\nThe mate gaped, and yawned, and blinked, and opened his eyes with a\r\nglassy, dreamy stare, dazzled by a candle-light, which flickered in his\r\nface, and confused by the uproar. He was like a bat suddenly plunging\r\ninto a lighted parlor full of noisy children--out of the midst of a dark\r\nnight. Only he wasn’t quite so much awake as a bat might be.\r\n\r\n“My--name’s--Wade,” he ejaculated at last, in a slow and solemn tone.\r\n\r\n“Hi, hi, hi! Yah, yah, yah! Hi, yah! h-o-o-o-o! Get up!”’\r\n\r\n“My ole ’oman’s name’s Gipson,” continued the mate, in a dreamy voice,\r\nas though amid his dreams he was still following out the one train of\r\nthought which seemed to engross his mind during his waking hours.\r\n\r\n“Ya, ya, ya, ya! Get up! Get up! Hal-l-o-o-o-o-o! Bow-avoav-wow!\r\nBa-a-a-a-a!” and with yells and shouts like these, with cock-crows, with\r\nall the cries of a crowded barn-yard, the boys returned to their effort\r\nat rousing him.\r\n\r\n“An’ ye’ll not find many of that name in this country!” said the mate,\r\nwith a tone, to which he seemed struggling to give a sleepy emphasis.\r\n\r\nUp rose the barn-yard cries again, mingled with yells, shrieks,\r\nbellowings, cat-calls, hoots, and roars.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” cried Bart, shaking his head violently. “Won’t you get\r\nup?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir!” said the mate; but whether if referred to his dream, or was\r\nintended as a reply to Bart, did not very clearly appear. The boys began\r\nto despair, and at length, after further endeavors, they were compelled\r\nto give up. They accordingly returned to Mr. Long, and informed him of\r\ntheir utter failure.\r\n\r\nMr. Long’s eyes glared wildly.\r\n\r\n“Very well!” said he, sternly, and with a dark frown. “Ve-e-ry well! I’ll\r\nsee if I can’t wake him this time. I’ve been humbugged long enough; and\r\nif words are of no use, I’ll have to try what virtue there is in cold\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he seized a pail, filled it at the well, and strode to the\r\nbarn, followed by all the boys. Reaching the place, he advanced to the\r\nmate, and mercilessly emptied the entire contents full upon his head.\r\n\r\nThat succeeded.\r\n\r\nWith a gasp, a splutter, and a shriek, the mate started to his feet,\r\nlooking wildly around as he tried to regain the breath which Mr. Long\r\nhad so rudely driven out of him.\r\n\r\n“What--what--what--why, what--d’ye--mean?”\r\n\r\n“I mean this,” cried Mr. Long, “that you’re wanted on board, and if you\r\ndon’t go, I’ll empty the whole well on you.”\r\n\r\nThe mate looked at him half fearfully, half reproachfully, and then,\r\nshaking the water out of his dripping locks, he slowly wended his way to\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\nAt last all were on board; the baskets and boxes were in the hold, the\r\nlines were cast off, the sails were hoisted, and the Antelope dropped\r\ndown the stream. Messrs. Simmons and Long retired, but most of the boys\r\nremained on deck for some time, singing, and laughing, and joking with\r\neach one about the peculiar mishaps which he might have incurred during\r\nthe last eventful week. At length all retired, and silence reigned over\r\nthe schooner and over the deep.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning all were up. The sea, far and wide, was as smooth\r\nas glass, except where long lines, and occasional ripples, showed the\r\nmeeting of opposing currents. Above, the sky was cloudless, the sun was\r\nbright, and in the air not a breath of wind was stirring. Upon this Mr.\r\nLong looked with extreme impatience, frowning darkly upon land, sea,\r\nand sky. The schooner’s sails were flapping idly, her head was pointed\r\ntoward the Five Islands, and Captain Corbet was standing listlessly at\r\nthe helm.\r\n\r\n“Captain, what’s all this?” asked Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“The schooner is heading toward the Five Islands. Are we going back?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir. The schooner’s not particular just now whar she heads.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you steer for Grand Pré?”\r\n\r\n“Jest what I’d like to do, if she’d let me.”\r\n\r\n“Let you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. There ain’t a mite o’ wind, an’ she’s, goin’ every which way.”\r\n\r\n“Then we’re standing still, and doing nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Standin’ still?” cried Captain Corbet. “Lor’ bless you, a couple of\r\nhours ago we were ten miles up there;” and he pointed far away toward\r\nthe other end of the bay.\r\n\r\n“Up there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. We’re not standin’ still; not by no manner o’ means.”\r\n\r\n“What are we doing?”\r\n\r\n“Driftin’.”\r\n\r\n“Drifting?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; goin’ ahead like a race-horse--head fust, tail fust, sideways, end\r\non, and every kind o’ way that a floatin’ craft kin move.”\r\n\r\n“Where are we drifting to?”\r\n\r\n“Down to Blomidon.”\r\n\r\n“Blomidon!” cried Mr. Long, aghast.\r\n\r\n“Yes; an’ farther too. It’ll be lucky if we don’t find ourselves out in\r\nthe Bay of Fundy before long.”\r\n\r\n“But can’t you _do_ something? Can’t you sail for some harbor?”\r\n\r\n“Jest what I’m a pinin’ to do, on’y I can’t come it, nohow. Ef I had\r\na steam tug-boat I’d clap a line on board her, an’ get into a place of\r\nrefooge; but bein’ as there isn’t any, we’ve got to drift.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you anchor?”\r\n\r\n“Anchor?” cried Captain Corbet, in surprise. “Why, the anchor’s broke.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Mr. Long, in bitter vexation, “haven’t you got\r\nsomething--no sweeps?”\r\n\r\n“Not a sweep, as I’m a livin’ Corbet.”\r\n\r\nIt was too true. There was no wind, and they were drifting at the mercy\r\nof the tide. The vessel went every way, heading in no direction.\r\nThey had no anchor, and they could not sail into the shore. They were\r\ncompletely helpless. By this time they had all hoped to be near their\r\ndestination; but it seemed, from appearances, that they were farther\r\naway than ever.\r\n\r\nWhat brought their situation home most forcibly to all, was the solemn\r\nfact that their provision was now limited to Indian meal and molasses,\r\nwith a little salt pork. If Solomon had only been on board, it would\r\nnot have been so bad, for the genius of the venerable cook would have\r\nevolved even out of such unpromising materials as these a wonderful\r\nvariety of palatable dishes. But Solomon was far away, and the cooking\r\nwas intrusted to the clumsy hands of the mate. His attempts were so\r\ndeplorable that the boys were permitted to make experiments of their own\r\nin the lofty art of cookery. The consequence was, that they spent the\r\nwhole morning in the cabin, and used up most of the molasses in making\r\ncandy, which, though very badly burned, was still more agreeable than\r\nthe burned paste of Indian meal which the mate laid before them as a\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nThe hours of the morning passed, and neither anger, nor impatience, nor\r\nhunger could have any effect upon the relentless tides. The schooner\r\ncalmly and placidly went drifting on, past Blomidon, past Cape Split;\r\nand they would assuredly have drifted out into the Bay of Fundy, had\r\nthey not, very fortunately, encountered a side current, which bore them\r\ninto a bay by Spencer’s Island. There they remained embayed till the\r\nturn of tide, and then they were borne out again, and up the channel, on\r\nthe way back into the Basin of Minas.\r\n\r\nThey were so near the shore that Mr. Long deliberated seriously about\r\nlanding, going on foot to Parrsboro’ village, and trying to get a\r\nrow-boat to take them to Cornwallis, or taking the steamer to Windsor,\r\nor doing something else equally desperate. But Captain Corbet assured\r\nhim that the steamer would not come for two days, and that he would be\r\nutterly unable to get any men to row him so far. So he was compelled to\r\nstay by the schooner.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet bore all this with admirable equanimity, looking with a\r\nmild concern at the impatience of Mr. Long, and regarding the boys with\r\nthe indulgent smile of a superior being. Leaving the tiller to take care\r\nof itself, he mingled with them, and conversed freely with all. They\r\ndrifted far up into the Basin of Minas, and looked forward to nothing\r\nbetter than a return to Blomidon and Cape Split, with, perhaps, an\r\nexcursion in the Bay of Fundy.\r\n\r\nSo the day passed, and night came. On the following morning they found\r\nthemselves still in the Basin of Minas, not far from the Five Islands,\r\nand drifting toward Blomidon.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “I’ve been a-thinkin’ that this here is just\r\nlike the Flyin’ Dutchman. You’ve heerd tell of him; course. They say\r\nhe’s a-sailin’ an’ a-beatin’ round the Cape of Good Hope, but can’t\r\nnever get round, nohow. That’s jest the pecooliarity of our position.\r\nHere we are, almost in sight of home, you may say, an’ still we have to\r\ngo a-driftin’ an’ a-driftin’, an’ I shouldn’t wonder if we’ll get out\r\ninto the Bay of Fundy to-day. If that happens, it wouldn’t be a wonder\r\nif we were blown off to Bosting.”\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Mr. Long, “I can’t stand this. I must get ashore. If we\r\nget near to Blomidon again, I’ll take Bruce Rawdon, and go ashore in\r\nthe boat. I _must_ go, for it’s a matter of the highest importance. Of\r\ncourse, it’s different with you. You wouldn’t care if you drifted here\r\ntill doomsday.”\r\n\r\nAt this Captain Corbet thrust both hands deep into his trousers’\r\npockets, and regarded Mr. Long with a fixed gaze.\r\n\r\n“_Me?_” said he, in a mild and almost parental tone. “_Me_ not care?\r\n_me!_ Look here, Mr. Long. Do you know what I am? I’m a parient! Your\r\nbooks call you home, sir; but what is it that’s a-callin’ o’ me? My\r\nbabby, sir! That there tender infant has twined hisself round my boosom;\r\nan’ what am I a-doin’? You don’t know, sir; but I’m a-yearnin’ an’\r\na-pinin’ for my babby. He’s the most wonderful babby that I ever see,”\r\n continued the captain, in a faltering voice. “He’s got the pootiest\r\ncrow; and if you’d jest hear him say his ga, ga, ga--”\r\n\r\n“O, bother your confounded baby!” said Mr. Long, with brutal rudeness,\r\nturning away abruptly.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet looked after him with a puzzled expression. At first,\r\nindignant surprise seemed to predominate, and those who stood near\r\nanticipated an outburst of long-restrained feeling. But it was only for\r\na moment. Then Captain Corbet’s better angel came to his assistance.\r\nIndignation vanished, and the face that was turned toward Mr. Long had\r\non it nothing but a meek, sad smile.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Thar, that’s it; allus the same,” said he; “on-sympathetic, hard as\r\na milestone, an’ owdacious in opposition to the tender babe. Human\r\nnatur’,” he continued, elevating his patriarchal head, and regarding\r\nMr. Long’s back with a severe dignity,--“human natur’ might exult in a\r\nadministerin’ of a rebewk to sich langedge; but I’ve learned a better\r\nlesson. Yes, boys. I’ve sot at the feet of my babby. The aged Corbet\r\nhas received insterruction from a mild infant. Now, I regard all that,”\r\n waving his hand toward Mr. Long, “not with anger, not with re-perroach,\r\nno, but with kimpassion. I pity him. I feel sorry for him. To him is\r\nunknown the holiest feeling of the hewman boosum; sich as _I_ feel, sich\r\nas every feyther feels when he’s a-nussin’ of his _peressh_us babby.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n_Blomidon, insulted, avenges himself.--A Victim devotes himself to\r\nappease his Wrath.--Original Views of Captain Corbet with regard to the\r\nArchaeology and the Science of Navigation._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE schooner went on drifting, and drew near to Blomidon again. The\r\ngiant cliff frowned darkly overhead, its sides all scarred and riven by\r\nthe tempests of centuries, its base worn by the fierce tides that never\r\ncease to sweep to and fro. Standing as it does, it forms one of the\r\nsublimest objects in nature. Other cliffs are far higher, and every way\r\nmore stupendous; but Blomidon is so peculiar by its shape, its position,\r\nand its surroundings, that it stands monarch of the scene, and rises\r\nalways with a certain regal majesty, seldom appearing without its diadem\r\nof clouds. All around are low lands, wide meadows, and quiet valleys,\r\nand the far spreading sea, into which this rugged height is boldly\r\nprojected, terminating an abrupt rocky wall. From the shores, for many\r\nand many a mile around, wherever the eye may wander over the scenery, it\r\nrests upon this as the centre of the view.\r\n\r\n“Blomidon,” said Bart, “looks more magnificently than ever, and we have\r\nan excellent chance for a close inspection.”\r\n\r\n“I confess,” said Bruce, “that I would rather not have so good a chance\r\njust now. I’d rather be near the mud flats of Cornwallis than this\r\nmajestic cliff.”\r\n\r\n“It’s my opinion,” said Phil, “that Blomidon is taking it out of us.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“How? Why, because we slighted him. We started with the intention of\r\nlanding here, and instead of doing so we’ve been almost everywhere but\r\nhere. So now he has got us, and he will keep us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if we only had something to eat, I wouldn’t care.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t eat pork.”\r\n\r\n“And I always hated Indian meal.”\r\n\r\n“.And I’m getting tired of molasses candy.”\r\n\r\n“Besides, I don’t believe that it’s healthy.”\r\n\r\n“And then, you know, it’s always burnt.”\r\n\r\n“But it certainly takes away one’s appetite.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s a consideration. What would become of us if our appetites\r\nwere left?”\r\n\r\nAs they spoke, Mr. Long drew near. They were within a stone’s throw of\r\nthe cliff, and were drifting slowly by. He looked up at the summit,\r\nas it. towered far above him, and then ran his eye along the black,\r\ntempest-torn sides.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said he, with a smile, “you’re right. Blomidon feels his\r\nmajesty to be slighted. He’s avenging himself on us. He’ll keep us here\r\ntill he gets a victim, or at least till some apology is made. Now, I’m\r\ngoing to appease his sullen majesty.”\r\n\r\n“How’s that, sir?”\r\n\r\n“By offering up a victim. And who do you think it will be? It will\r\nbe--myself.”\r\n\r\n“You, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’m going to land.”\r\n\r\n“To land!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. One of you can take me ashore, and leave me. I know the place well\r\nenough, and will walk to the nearest village. I can get a horse easily\r\nenough, and be home before sundown.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t some of us go with you, sir?” asked Bart, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“O, no. It’s better for you to stay. You had better remain together;\r\nbesides, the walk will be too rough. For my part, I wouldn’t go if I\r\ncould help it. But I must go. My work demands my presence at once. And\r\nthen--I really can’t stand this any longer. I could, perhaps, endure the\r\ndelay, but I can _not_ stand Captain Corbet and his--ehem!--his baby.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he looked toward Captain Corbet, who was out of\r\nhearing, and was standing discoursing, with a pleasant smile, to Bogud\r\nand Jiggins.\r\n\r\n“Bruce, will you put me ashore?” asked Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, sir, with the greatest pleasure. But I’m very Sorry that\r\nyou’re going.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you’d let all of us go, sir,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\nMr. Long shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “You see it will be easy enough for one to get a horse to\r\ntake him over, but so many could not do it. So I’ll go alone. I’ve been\r\nthere before, and I know my way.”\r\n\r\n“It will seem worse than ever when you go, sir,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“O, you’ll have a wind before long. You won’t be home as soon as I am,\r\nfor the tide won’t let you; but, I dare say, you won’t be much behind\r\nme. Take care of yourselves, and don’t try the boat again.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Mr. Long went to Mr. Simmons, to announce his\r\ndetermination. That gentleman was much surprised, and endeavored to\r\ndissuade him. But Mr. Long was not to be dissuaded. Captain Corbet said\r\nnothing. He merely elevated his eyebrows; and there was that in his face\r\nwhich seemed to say, “There, I knew it. I’m not at all surprised. I’m\r\nsorry for him, but not surprised. He’s capable of any piece of wildness.\r\nHe can’t appreciate babbies. What more would you have from such a\r\nman?” All this his face fully expressed, but not a word of all this did\r\nCaptain Corbet say.\r\n\r\nMr. Long shook hands with all the boys. Bruce was in the boat waiting,\r\nand soon he jumped in.\r\n\r\nThe line was cast, off, and Bruce sculled on over the smooth water\r\nwithout much difficulty. The tide was running rapidly, but there was\r\nplenty of coast before them; it was not far away, and before long the\r\nboat had reached the beach.\r\n\r\nMr. Long jumped out, and as his foot touched the shore, he gave a sigh\r\nof relief.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed; “here I am at last.”\r\n\r\n“Which way are you going, sir?” asked Bruce. “Well, I’ll walk along the\r\nshore for two or three miles, and after that I can find my way to a\r\nroad.”\r\n\r\n“You know your way I suppose, sir?” asked Bruce, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“O, yes. I’ve been here often. I know all about it. I’ll make very good\r\ntime if I don’t get attracted by the minerals. That’s my only danger\r\nhere. Good by.”\r\n\r\nHe wrung Bruce’s hand, and walked off. Bruce then returned to the\r\nschooner, and reached it without difficulty. The boys on board watched\r\nMr. Long for some time. The vessel was drifting down the strait, and he\r\nwas walking along the shore in an opposite direction. They watched his\r\nblack figure till he turned around a curve in the shore, and passed out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\nFor some time the vessel continued to drift under the same\r\ncircumstances, without any signs of wind, or oven the prospect of a\r\nfriendly mud flat on which they, could be quietly and comfortably\r\nstranded. This time they drifted below Spencer’s Island, and looked ont\r\ninto the Bay of Fundy with a vague fear of being borne away into its\r\nwaters, and carried off for immeasurable distances. But the tide soon\r\nturned after they had reached this place; and though the dark form of\r\nIle Haute towered up gloomily from out the waters of the Bay of Fundy,\r\nyet they came no nearer-to it.\r\n\r\nOn the turn of the tide they drifted back once more. This gave them much\r\nrelief, for as long as they were within the Basin of Minas it did not\r\nseem so bad. As they drifted along they came to the place where Mr. Long\r\nhad landed, and they watched anxiously to see if there were any signs of\r\nhim. They found none.\r\n\r\n“If we only had a glass,” said Bart. “Captain Corbet, haven’t you a\r\nglass?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--a kind of a one.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“It’s in the cabin.”\r\n\r\n“May I have it?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes.”\r\n\r\nBart went down and looked for some time. At last he returned\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n“1 can’t find any glass, Captain Corbet,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s jest in front of yer nose,” said Captain Corbet. “Come down.\r\nI’ll show you where it is.”\r\n\r\nDown went Bart after Captain Corbet, and, the latter pointed to the\r\nwall. .\r\n\r\n“There,” said he. “I wonder you didn’t see it.”\r\n\r\n“Where?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Where? Why, there,” said Captain Corbet; and saying this he put\r\nhis horny finger on a small triangular fragment of what was once a\r\nlooking-glass, which small triangular fragment was fastened to a post,\r\non one side of the cabin, with brass trunk nails.\r\n\r\n“There it is,” said Captain Corbet. “You don’t seem to have any eyes in\r\nyour head, though you’re sharp enough sometimes, gracious knows.”\r\n\r\n“That!” cried Bart. “That! Why, it’s a spyglass I want.”\r\n\r\n“A spy-glass no, yes. Wal, I hain’t got none.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t any!”\r\n\r\n“No; never owned one in all my born days.”\r\n\r\n“That’s odd, too. I thought every sea captain had to have one.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, no. There ain’t no great use for sich. They’re a kind o’ luxury,\r\nyou see. I don’t have any call for them. There’s other machines, too,\r\nthat they talk about, sech as quadrupeds an’ sextons; but I never bother\r\nmy head about, ’em.”\r\n\r\n“Why, how do you manage to sail your schooner?”\r\n\r\n“How? Why, jest up sail an’ let her slide.”\r\n\r\n“But what do you do when you’re out of sight of land?”\r\n\r\n“Never git out of sight. Ef I should, I’d steer straight back for the\r\nland agin.”\r\n\r\n“What do you do in the fog?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“The fog? I jest do the best I kin. Any ways, I don’t see what use a\r\nsexton would be in a fog, nor a quadruped nuther. Then them sort o’\r\ncon-sarns have to be worked by the sun. So, you see, they’re no manner\r\no’ use in these here waters, nor in no waters at all. People git along\r\njest as well without ’em. Why, here am I, an’ I bin sailin’ this forty\r\nyear, an’ never tetched a sexton nor a quadruped; and me bin all the way\r\nto Bosting. Besides, did Noah make his vyge in the Ark with a quadruped?\r\nNo, _sir_. Did Solomon have one in the ship that he sailed to Ophir?\r\nAgin I say, no, _sir_. So I conclude that what the prophets, an’\r\npatriarchs, an’ wise men of old,--an’ a darn sight better men than sea\r\ncaptains are as they go these times;--what they did without, we can do\r\nwithout.”\r\n\r\n“But you have a compass?”\r\n\r\n“Course I have.”\r\n\r\n“They didn’t have a compass in those days.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they did.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me--they didn’t have anything of the kind.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse _me_, young sir,--bein’ a man old enough, to be your feyther,\r\nan’ a seafarin’ man, too, an’, what’s more, a man that reads his\r\nBible,--but they did.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know how you make that out.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever read Acts?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever happen to hear tell of the vygo of the ‘postle Paul, young\r\nsir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but what’s that got to do with it? You don’t mean to say that he\r\nhad a compass.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the very pint that I’m a drivin’ at.”\r\n\r\n“What! that the apostle Paul had a compass?”\r\n\r\n“Course he had.”\r\n\r\n“Why, the compass wasn’t known till the fourteenth century. Flavio\r\nGioja, of Amalfi, is the one that they say invented it.”\r\n\r\n“So that’s what they teach you over there at the Academy--is it?” said\r\nCaptain Corbet with a look that would have been one of scorn if it\r\nhadn’t been so full of pity. “So that’s what they teach--is it? Wal!\r\nwall wal! If I ever! I never did! However, I’ll show you at once what’s\r\nthe wuth, the terew wuth, of your lamin’, when it’s put fair an’ square\r\nin opposition to facts. Look here now, an’ listen, an’ don’t forget. In\r\nthe account of that vyge, it says distindtly, ‘So we fetched-a compass.’\r\nWhat have you got to say to that, now? hey?”\r\n\r\nAnd Captain Corbet drew himself up, and watched the effect of this\r\nstartling piece of intelligence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0293]\r\n\r\nUpon Bart the effect was instantaneous, though not of the kind which\r\nCaptain Corbet expected. A light broke in upon his mind, and a smile\r\nburst forth, and spread like sunshine over his lately puzzled face. He\r\nsaid nothing for some time, but looked away so as to take in the full\r\nflavor of what he considered so good a thing.\r\n\r\n“O, yes,” said he at last. “I see. I understand. I never thought of that\r\nbefore. I must let the fellows know I’ll tell them all at school, from\r\nDr. Porter down to the smallest boy in the primary department. And I’ll\r\nlet them all know that it was you that told me. They’ve all got an\r\nidea that it was invented either by the Arabs, or the Greeks, or the\r\nItalians; but now they shall hear Captain Corbet’s theory.”\r\n\r\n“Yes--do--do,” said-Captain Corbet, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“An’ tell them that _I_ told you. Tell Dr. Porter. I’d like to know what\r\nthe doctor’s got to say.”\r\n\r\n“Say! He’ll say nothing--he’ll be dumb. But I must hurry up. It’s\r\nstrange, too. I was sure you had a spy-glass. You had one in the boat\r\nwhen you came after us the time we were aground.”\r\n\r\n“So we had, but it wan’t mine.”\r\n\r\n“Whose was it?”\r\n\r\n“Captain Pratt’s.”\r\n\r\n“O, then, that accounts for it. I’m sorry too. I hoped to be able to\r\nfind out where Mr. Long was.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Long? Don’t bother about him. He’s all right. He’s among his\r\nnative rocks. A man like that; a man that’s a stranger to the charms\r\nof a gentle smilin’ babby; a man that gets mad with others, who are\r\nnat’rally pinin’ for their absent offspring--such a man has a heart that\r\nis a rock, an’ had oughter make up his abode among rocks. I see now why\r\nit is that he spends all his time a gatherin’ of ’em. Why, I told him\r\nsome of the most affectin’ things about my babby. But what did he say?\r\n_He!_ He almost swore! Can any parient be willin’ to put his son to\r\nbe taught by a man like that--a man whose heart is as hard as a nether\r\nmilestone?”\r\n\r\n“He’s very kind to us,” said Bart. “All of the boys at school love Mr.\r\nLong dearly.”\r\n\r\n“That ain’t the pint,” said Captain Corbet. “The pint is, how does he\r\nfeel about a babby? Doos he yearn over ’em? Doos he delight in their\r\nlittle pooty ways? Doos he crow over ’em? Doos he nuss ’em an’\r\ndandle ’em? I jedge of a man that way, an’ by them there signs; an’\r\nI call that, by a long chalk, the most entirely jodgematical way of\r\nreadin’ an’ interpretatin’ human natur’. Read by that light, Mr. Long\r\nain’t a succumstance. He’s left us. I’m glad. Let him wander among the\r\nrocks and stones of Blomidon!”\r\n\r\nWith this, Captain Corbet turned away, not caring to pursue the subject\r\nfurther. Bart went on deck again, to spread among his companions\r\nCaptain Corbet’s peculiar views on the subject of spy-glasses, sextants,\r\nquadrants, and compasses.\r\n\r\nThese new theories created an immense sensation; and whatever opinion\r\nthere may have been had before about the captain’s seamanship, there was\r\nno question now as to the perfect originality of his views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n_Being jolly under creditable Circumstances.--Songs, Medleys, Choruses,\r\nCheers, Laughter, Speeches, Responses.--The Mud again.--Hard and\r\nfast.--What’ll you do now, my Boy?_\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. LONG had gone from their gaze completely, and could be seen no\r\nmore. While trying to find him, the boys made conjectures as to where\r\nhe might be. Giving up all idea of his being on the beach, they imagined\r\nhim wending his solitary way far up the coast, or, perhaps, scaling the\r\nmighty cliff itself in some more accessible place. Gradually the vessel\r\ndrifted farther and farther away, until at length it was far up in Minas\r\nBasin.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Bart, “this is getting to be monotonous. We’re like\r\nferrymen, going forever between two points.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, or like the pendulum of a clock, vibrating always, backward and\r\nforward.”\r\n\r\n“One more night of drifting is before us.”\r\n\r\n“More meals of pork and molasses.”\r\n\r\n“Or burnt Indian paste.”\r\n\r\n“Or smoky molasses candy.”\r\n\r\n“The worst of it is, that we have nothing to amuse ourselves with.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity we couldn’t start some game.”\r\n\r\n“Bart, tell a story.”\r\n\r\n“A story?” said Bart. “Who could tell a story under such circumstances?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe,” said Bruce, “that a calm was ever known to last so\r\nlong in the Basin of Minas. Was it, captain?” he added, appealing to\r\nCaptain Corbet, who had just emerged from the cabin.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” replied Captain Corbet, “it’s not usual to have a calm in the\r\nmonth of May; still, we do-have ’em sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“I should rather think we had,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“I’ve known ’em last a week,” said Captain Corbet, solemnly.\r\n\r\n“A week?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a hull week; but that was in July. Still, there’s no knowin’. It\r\nmay be in May this year.”\r\n\r\n“Then we’ll have to go ashore in the boat tomorrow. I will. I’ll mutiny,\r\nand start off.”\r\n\r\nSo spoke Bart, and the rest all declared that they would do the same.\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll have wind to-night,” said Captain Corbet, in a tone of\r\nvague encouragement. “Yes, yes, we must have wind to-night, or before\r\nmorn-in’. We’ve had about calm enough. You feel anxious, no deoubt, all\r\non ye,” he continued, with a superior smile; “but if you feel so, jedge\r\nwhat I must feel--me, with, my babby. Why, every minute,--yes, every\r\nmortial minute,--the voice of that there smilin’ babe is a-soundin’ in\r\nmy ears. Sometimes he says, ‘GGa-ga-ga,’ and sometimes ‘Da-da-da;’ and\r\nsometimes the cunnin’ leetil human creetur emits a cry,--a favorite\r\none of his’n,--that sounds jest like ‘Bo-rax! Bo-rax! Bo-rax!’ Isn’t it\r\nodd?”\r\n\r\nAnd he looked at the boys with that mild face of his, whereon was\r\nintermingled an expression partly made up of a father’s affection, and\r\npartly of tender enjoyment of his little cherub’s innocent ways.\r\n\r\n“And what does he mean by Borax?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“What does he mean? Why, a’most everything. It’s a pet name he gives to\r\nme, you know. That and ‘Ga-ga’--”\r\n\r\n“I suppose he doesn’t know the English language yet.”\r\n\r\n“No, he hain’t larned it yet; but he’s a-gettin’ on. Why, I could stand\r\nhere for hours and tell you words of his’n. He’s uncommon spry, too.\r\nHe--”\r\n\r\n“Bart,” cried Bruce, suddenly, “start up a song. Sing ‘Uncle Ned.’”\r\n\r\nAt this Bart started up a song, which was a medley, made up of “Uncle\r\nNed” and “The Mermaid.” The first verse was as follows:--\r\n\r\n               “There was an ole nigger, and he sailed on the sea;\r\n\r\n                   And he lived not far from the land;\r\n\r\n               And he had no wool on de top of his head,\r\n\r\n                   And a comb and a glass in his hand.\r\n\r\n                        Chorus.\r\n\r\n                   “O, the sto-o-o-o-o-o-o-ormy winds, how they blow!\r\n\r\n                   So take up de shubbel an’ de hoe,\r\n\r\n                   While we poor sailor-boys are climbin’ up aloft.\r\n\r\n                   He has gone whar de good niggers go--‘gers go--‘gers go--\r\n\r\n                   He has gone whar de good niggers go.”\r\n\r\nThis astonishing production was sung with uncommon energy and spirit.\r\nAt its close Bart retired below, while the others went on singing; and\r\nafter a short time he returned with a piece of paper in his hand, and a\r\ntriumphant smile on his face.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, Bart! what have you got there?” cried Bruce. .\r\n\r\n“It’s an original song,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“By whom?”\r\n\r\n“Myself,” he replied, meekly.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! Go it! Sing it! Give it to us!”\r\n\r\n“All right; but you must all join in the chorus.”\r\n\r\n“Of course. What’s the tune?”\r\n\r\n“‘Auld Lang Syne.’”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead, then, young feller! Propel! Shoot away!\r\nBeady--present--fire!”\r\n\r\nWaiting for the noise to subside, Bart stood in the midst of them, and\r\nafter the cries had ceased, he began:\r\n\r\n                   “Should Capting Corbet be forgot,\r\n\r\n                        A-sailin’ o’er the sea!\r\n\r\n                   O, no! when we get back to school,\r\n\r\n                        We’ll often think of he.\r\n\r\n                        Choruss.\r\n\r\n                   “We’ll often think of he, my friends;\r\n\r\n                        We’ll often think of he.\r\n\r\n                   O, yes! when we get back to school,\r\n\r\n                        We’ll often think of he.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” cried Captain Corbet, with a smile of pleasure wreathing\r\nhis venerable face. “Why, it ain’t--why, railly--why, it is me, too!\r\nWhy, railly! An’ you made up all that? Wal, now, I call that rale cute.\r\nI do, railly. On’y I do wish, sense you did take the trouble to make\r\nup that there,--bein’ as your hand was in,--I wish you’d kinder added\r\na line interriducin’ the babby. We like to be kind o’ onseparable. It\r\nseems kind of agin natur’ to separate us.”\r\n\r\n“All right. I’ll introduce anything,” said Bart. “Here, boys, I’ll give\r\nyou another chorus.\r\n\r\n                   ‘We’ll often think of he, my friends;\r\n\r\n                        We’ll often think of he;\r\n\r\n                   The capting and his schewner gay,\r\n\r\n                        Likewise his small ba-be-e-e-e-e.’”\r\n\r\nThis new impromptu chorus was sung with still greater enthusiasm.\r\nCaptain Corbet was affected to tears. Emotion overpowered him. As soon\r\nas he could muster strength to speak, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“You’ve onmanned me--you have, railly. The mention of that blessed babby\r\nkind o’ took away all my strength. But I’ll reward you, boys. When we\r\nget back, I’ll make you all come up, and introduce you all to the babby\r\nhimself,--_sometime when the old woman’s away, you know,_” he added,\r\nmysteriously.\r\n\r\n“I will now occupy the time by continuing the hymn,” said Bart,\r\nsolemnly. Whereupon he proceeded:\r\n\r\n                   “I love to go to Blomidon,\r\n\r\n                        Its beauty for to feel;\r\n\r\n                   But I’d prefer a better fare\r\n\r\n                        Than pork and Indian meal.\r\n\r\n                        Chorus.\r\n\r\n                   “Than pork and Indian meal, my friends;\r\n\r\n                        Than pork and Indian meal.--\r\n\r\n                   O, I’d prefer a better fare\r\n\r\n                        Than pork and Indian meal.”\r\n\r\nThis was sung earnestly and with very deep feeling. The recollection of\r\ntheir melancholy condition caused a mild pathos to be infused into the\r\ntones of all. Some of them seemed to be shedding tears. At any rate,\r\nthey held handkerchiefs to their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe next verse:\r\n\r\n                   “I love to sail on Minas Bay,\r\n\r\n                        Its beauty for to see;\r\n\r\n                   To hunt for clams among the sands,\r\n\r\n                        And put them into me.\r\n\r\n                        CHorus.\r\n\r\n                   “And put them into me, my friends;\r\n\r\n                        And put them into me.\r\n\r\n                   To hunt for clams among the sands,\r\n\r\n                        And put them into me.”\r\n\r\nThe mild melancholy that characterized the last chorus here changed into\r\na livelier note, expressive of greater cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nThe next verse:\r\n\r\n                   “Pratt’s Cove it has the biggest clams\r\n\r\n                        That ever mortal saw;\r\n\r\n                   But when we hunt for clams again,\r\n\r\n                        We mustn’t eat them raw.\r\n\r\n                        CHorus.\r\n\r\n                   “We mustn’t eat them raw, my friends;\r\n\r\n                        We mustn’t swallow them raw.\r\n\r\n                   O, clams are good for human food,\r\n\r\n                        But we mustn’t eat them raw.”\r\n\r\nThis was sung energetically, yet in a dignified manner. The chorus was\r\nintended to convey a wholesome piece of advice to those who might\r\nhappen to be in need of it,--Pat, for instance,--and so it was sung with\r\ndignity; at the same time, the energy with which it was rendered was\r\nadmirably adapted to enforce the advice and carry it home to the heart\r\nand conscience of the hearer.\r\n\r\nThe next verse:\r\n\r\n                   “We’ve got molasses for our food,\r\n\r\n                        It came from Tri-ni-dad;\r\n\r\n                   And when to candy it is boiled,\r\n\r\n                        It really isn’t bad.\r\n\r\n                        Chorus,\r\n\r\n                   “It really isn’t bad, my friends;\r\n\r\n                        It isn’t very bad.\r\n\r\n                   Molasses, boiled, to candy turns,’\r\n\r\n                        And really isn’t bad.”\r\n\r\nA greater degree of liveliness prevailed here at the celebration of the\r\nonly eatable thing among the stores. There was an intention to do honor\r\nto the molasses, and honor was accordingly done.\r\n\r\nThe next verse:\r\n\r\n                   “Three cheers for Bogud, Billymack,\r\n\r\n                        Three cheers for all the crew,--\r\n\r\n                   For Jiggins, Sammy, Muclcle, Pat, .\r\n\r\n                        And three for Johnny Blue!\r\n\r\n                        Chorus.\r\n\r\n                   Three cheers for Johnny Blue, my friends,\r\n\r\n                        Three cheers for Johnny Blue,--\r\n\r\n                   For Jiggins, Sammy, Muckle, Pat,\r\n\r\n                        And three for Johnny Blue!”\r\n\r\nImmense enthusiasm. Surprise on the part of all the boys whose names\r\nwere thus so unexpectedly “wedded to song.” Recovering from their\r\nsurprise, each one jumped up, placed his hand on his heart, and\r\nacknowledged the compliment by a low bow; after which the song was sung\r\nagain; after which there came more bows; and it would have gone on thus,\r\nwith alternate bowing and singing, till the present time, had not the\r\nboys themselves felt overpowered, and demanded another verse.\r\n\r\nThe next verse:\r\n\r\n                   “Three cheers for all the boys on board;\r\n\r\n                        For Corbet three times three;\r\n\r\n                   And thirty more for the jolly black flag\r\n\r\n                        Of the ‘B. O. W. C.’!\r\n\r\n                        Chorus.\r\n\r\n                   “The ‘B. O. W. C.’ my friends,\r\n\r\n                        The ‘B. O. W. C.’\r\n\r\n                   Ever so many more for the jolly black flag\r\n\r\n                        Of the ‘ B. O. W. C.’!”\r\n\r\nThis last chorus was sung with a vehemence, an ardor, and an enthusiasm\r\nthat are absolutely indescribable. It included all, and identified all,\r\nin the most delicate manner, with the “B. O. W. C.” It was sung over and\r\nover, and over yet again, accompanied with any quantity of cheers for\r\neverything under the sun. The special allusion to Corbet, in the last\r\nverse, elicited a fresh display of emotion from that venerable and\r\nhighly-impressible party. He did not say much, however. He merely went\r\nround among the boys, and shook hands most warmly with all of them, one\r\nby one. He asked each one about his father, his mother, his brothers\r\nand sisters, and his uncles and aunts. He asked their full names, their\r\nages, and the number of their blood relations. He then made a public\r\naddress to them, in which he freely offered, at any time, to take any\r\nof them, or all of them, on a cruise anywhere, at a moment’s warning.\r\nFinally, he reiterated his offer to introduce his babby to them all.\r\nThis formed a climax. Beyond this he could not go. And there, naturally\r\nand inevitably, his eloquent oration ended.\r\n\r\nSo passed the time. And when you take into consideration the solemn fact\r\nthat all this time they were drifting, that the sea was smooth, that\r\nthere wasn’t a breath of wind, that there was no prospect of getting\r\nhome, or anywhere else, for that matter,--you will come to the\r\nconclusion that these boys were jolly under creditable circumstances.\r\nAnd you will be right in that conclusion; for it was in the very face\r\nof calms, strong tides, empty larders, wanderings at sea, famine, and\r\nprivations of all kinds, that these boys stood up and sang their song.\r\n\r\nIn this sense it became not a mere song of jollity or of idle sport.\r\nIt was more. It was the song of the unconquered soul. It was a defiance\r\nhurled full in the face of Fortune.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed. The shades of night came down. It was dark, and\r\nit grew darker. Until late, the sounds of song, of laughter, and of\r\nmerriment, came forth and resounded through the night. At length all was\r\nstill. All on board had descended to their couches, and were wrapped in\r\nprofound slumber.\r\n\r\nThe boy who awaked first in the morning gave such a shout that all the\r\nothers were roused at once.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?\r\n\r\nWhat! An instant told them all. Down through the hatchway there came a\r\nblast of wind strong and cool, and full of sea salt. Above, they could\r\nsee the sail distended to its utmost, while higher up the clouds were\r\nscudding across the sky. Below, the vessel was lying far over, as\r\nit yielded to the wind; and her pitching and tossing, together with the\r\ndash of waves against her bows, told all that she was moving swiftly\r\nthrough the water.\r\n\r\nThey hurried up to the deck.\r\n\r\nFar around them was the blue sea, now tossing into white-capped waves.\r\nA fresh, strong wind was blowing over the water, and it was fair. On the\r\nright rose Blomidon from out the foam that gathered at its base; on the\r\nleft the water extended till it was lost in the distance amid the haze\r\nthat hung over the low-lying shore. Behind them lay the Five Islands,\r\nand all that water over which they had so long been drifting. The vessel\r\nwas heading straight to Grand Pré, and was tearing her way through the\r\nwater as she had never done before within the experience of any of her\r\npresent passengers.\r\n\r\nJoy reigned supreme. Loud cheers and cries of delight burst forth.\r\n\r\n“Why, captain,” said Bart, “I. began to think that the Antelope couldn’t\r\nsail at all.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t she, though? O, she isn’t a bad sailor when she’s got a wind dead\r\nfair like this.”\r\n\r\n“When’ll we get to Grand Pré?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, that’s difficult to say,” said the captain, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Why, you don’t mean to say that there is any danger of the wind\r\nstopping now, or changing?”\r\n\r\n“O, no; there’s no danger of that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what is there?”\r\n\r\n“Why, we can’t get to the wharf.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“It’ll be low tide when we get there.”\r\n\r\n“Low tide!” repeated Bart, in consternation; “and how far will we be\r\nfrom the wharf?”\r\n\r\n“O, miles; and that isn’t the worst of it. You’ll have the Cornwallis\r\nRiver between you and Grand Pré.”\r\n\r\nBart said no more, but retired to convey this disheartening intelligence\r\nto his companions. They talked over it thoughtfully and with serious\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nThe vessel went on. The tide was against them, but the wind was strong\r\nand fair, and blew with undiminishing power. Looking toward the shore,\r\nthey could see that their progress was excellent.\r\n\r\nNearer they came, and nearer, until at last they saw before them a\r\nvast extent of mud flats, beyond which lay a low ridge all green with\r\nverdure; and they knew it as the dike of Grand Pré. Beyond this again\r\nascended the hills, with the white village at the base, and on the slope\r\nthe conspicuous form of the Academy, with its broad portico and lofty\r\ncupola. .\r\n\r\n“Where are you going now, captain? You can’t anchor. Is there a port\r\nhere to run the schooner into?”\r\n\r\n“Nary port.”\r\n\r\n“What’ll you do? Surely you won’t drift off again?”\r\n\r\n“Drift? No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“How will you manage?”\r\n\r\n“How? Why, there’s only one thing to do; and that is, to run her right\r\nstraight in on to a mud flat.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he looked steadily forward, and gave the tiller a pull\r\nto starboard. The schooner turned slightly. The next instant it ran\r\nsquarely upon the mud flat, and stuck there, hard and fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\n_A wild Undertaking.--A Race for Life.--The lost Boot.--The\r\nQuicksands.--The Isle of Safety.--The Mud Gulch.--Crossing the Abyss of\r\nMud.--Bruce’s Doldrum.--Two forlorn Figures.--Rapturous Welcome.--Speech\r\nby the Grand Panjandrum._\r\n\r\nTHERE they were on the mud flat. It was a situation in which the B.\r\nO. W. C. had been before, but experience had not made it any the more\r\npleasant to them.\r\n\r\n“We’ve done it before,” said Bruce, “and why shouldn’t we do it again?”\r\n\r\n“So I say,” remarked Arthur. “It’s a great deal farther,” said Phil,\r\n“but in my opinion it isn’t half so bad as the other one.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it isn’t,” said Tom. “The tide is leaving us rapidly, and\r\nwe’ll be able to jump out upon the mud, and not up to our necks in\r\nwater, as we did the last time.”\r\n\r\n“And so we needn’t prepare to fight with shovel-mouth sharks,” said\r\nPhil.\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said Bart, “it’s going to be a difficult job, and harder\r\nthan the last one, perhaps. We’ve got a couple of miles to go, instead\r\nof so many hundred yards. We must face that fact before leaving.”\r\n\r\n“We know that very well,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“You see there is Grand Pré just in front of us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we can’t go there, because between us and that place is the\r\nCornwallis River, which just now is an abyss of mud, with a strong\r\nstream running at the bottom. So we’ll have to make an angle, and go up\r\nthere toward the right, and go in a straight line to Cornwallis Bridge..\r\nIt will be two miles to the grass land, and another one to the bridge.\r\nSo we’ll have two miles of mud.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe the mud is any different from what we found in the\r\nother place.”\r\n\r\n“It may not be,” said Bruce, “yet there may be air-holes. We’ve got so\r\nfar to go that we may find almost anything--air-holes, quicksands, or\r\nanything else. Still, I don’t believe that we’ll meet with any.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s wait till the tide gets down to the bows, and then start,”\r\n said Tom.\r\n\r\nWith this the boys prepared for their journey. These preparations\r\nconsisted in nothing but getting some stout sticks, which they made by\r\nsplitting up a board, and smoothing each piece with a knife. After this\r\nthey informed Mr. Simmons of their intention. He looked aghast, and then\r\ntold them that they would get too muddy.\r\n\r\nAt this they laughed, and said that they were covered with mud from\r\ntheir many experiences in the voyage, and couldn’t be much worse. So Mr.\r\nSimmons looked at them from head to foot, and then at himself. By this\r\nhe discovered that the boys were in a comfortably muddy condition, and\r\nwhat was more, that he, Mr. Simmons, he himself, was decorated with\r\nmany mud marks, which sadly marred the beauty of his black attire. This\r\ndiscovery filled him with such horror that he hurried below, where the\r\nsound of a brush in violent exercise showed the boys that he was trying\r\nto eradicate the stains, so as to prepare himself for a solemn entry\r\ninto the village. He did not appear on deck again.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet, however, on learning their proposal, had much more to\r\nsay about it.\r\n\r\nHe listened with staring eyes, and then declared that they all were\r\ncrazy.\r\n\r\n“Crazy? Why, ye’re mad as March hares! Do ye know that that there mud is\r\nfull of air-holes, an’ inhospitable for man an’ beast? Horses air lost\r\nthere every year. So air knows likewise. People shun it. Death lurks\r\nthere. I wouldn’t go there for all the gold in Californy There’s\r\nquicksands, and there’s air-pots, and there’s holes of all kinds,\r\nthere’s deep gulps that you can’t cross no how.”\r\n\r\n“But did you ever hear of an accident?”\r\n\r\n“Course I have. My feyther told me onst about a neighbor of his’n that\r\nlost a friend down hereabouts. He was found next day lying on the shore\r\nup there--thrown up by the tide. Besides, my wife’s ma told me of people\r\nthat’s been a-missin’, an’ what it’s strongly suspected that they kind\r\no’ strayed down here, and got drownded. What d’ye say to that?”\r\n\r\n“O, it’s all the same. There are five of us. We’ll help one another.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, ye’ll help one another! Yes, but to sartin ruination. Why, see\r\nhere. Look at me. I’m more anxious, a hundred times, to got ashore\r\nthan you be. I’m a feyther. I’ve got a pinin’ babby that I’m a-yearnin’\r\nafter. I’ve got a kind of homesick feel-in’, that never leaves me, arter\r\nhim; ’ee bessed chicken, so it was! But do I go an’ resk my life? Do\r\nI throw myself away? Do I walk over quicksands, an’ air-holes, an’ mud\r\ngullies? Not I. I stand here like a man, an’ wait.”\r\n\r\n“All right, captain; we’ll tell them you’re comin’,” said Bart, stepping\r\nto the bows.\r\n\r\nBy this time the tide had lowered, so that they could get out from the\r\nvessel on the mud. One by one they descended. They found the mud soft,\r\nof course, but not very much so.\r\n\r\n“O, boys,” cried Captain Corbet, “come back!”\r\n\r\n“All right!” cried Bruce. “Come, boys, if we stand, we’ll stick in the\r\nmud. Hurry along!”\r\n\r\n“Bo-o-oys! come back,” wailed Captain Corbet. “If you get harmed, I\r\ncan’t follow you to help you.”\r\n\r\n“Good by.”\r\n\r\n“Bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oys! O, Bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oys!” wailed Captain\r\nCorbet, for the last time, as the boys went off. But this time they gave\r\nno response. He stood in silence, watching them, for a long, long time,\r\nwith deep anxiety. The other boys also looked after them with not a\r\ndoubt in the minds of any of them but that they would come back.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the boys walked on upon their dangerous way.\r\n\r\nPerhaps their very ignorance of that danger saved them from it. They\r\nwalked on in a straight line, knowing nothing of places which the people\r\nabout believed to be dangerous; and as they found the outset easy, they\r\nexpected all the rest would be the same. The mud was like that which\r\nthey had met with before--soft at the surface, but hard beneath, so that\r\nthey sank in a little distance at every step, but nevertheless, found\r\na firm foothold. The mud was so soft, and the foothold beneath so firm,\r\nthat their feet were not very badly clogged. They did not find it so\r\ndifficult as walking over clay roads after they had been soaked with\r\nrains, and cut up by heavy teams.\r\n\r\nThey walked on rapidly, in as straight a line as possible, laughing and\r\nshouting, declaring that mud fiats were slandered, and that there was\r\nmuch worse walking on many a country road.\r\n\r\nAt length the mud grew softer, and the bottom was not so near the\r\nsurface. To walk over this, even at a rapid pace, was difficult; for\r\nwhere the foot was planted at full length, it would sink so that it was\r\ndifficult to extricate it. A swifter pace was necessary.\r\n\r\n“Are you tired, Phil?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Phil; and, indeed, he seemed as fresh as any of them.\r\n\r\n“Because we’ll have to go faster,” said Bruce. “Come, now, boys--Indian\r\ntrot!”\r\n\r\nAway they went at the peculiar pace known by that name,--the body bent\r\nforward, and the fore part of the foot touching the ground with its\r\nelastic tread, moving at that slow, steady, easy trot which is faster\r\nand lighter than a walk, and but little more fatiguing to those who have\r\nthe knack of it. This carried them on very well for some considerable\r\ndistance farther, and on looking back they began to congratulate\r\nthemselves on the distance which they had already traversed. Ere long\r\nthe grass-covered marsh was within sight--the place where danger ended,\r\nand progress was easier. But between them and that place there still lay\r\ndifficulties which they knew not of.\r\n\r\nSuddenly as they ran on, they were arrested by a cry from Phil. They\r\nturned instantly, and were horrified at the sight that met their eyes.\r\nPhil, being the smallest and weakest, had fallen behind, and, being out\r\nof breath, had loitered a few paces so as to recover, thinking that he\r\nwould catch up.\r\n\r\nFeeling a pain in his side, he had stopped to fasten his belt tighter\r\naround his waist, and without thinking he had stood motionless for a\r\nminute. In that minute his feet had sunk in the treacherous soil. In his\r\nsudden fright at this discovery, he had cried out, and made a desperate\r\neffort to extricate himself. With a jerk he had drawn forth one foot,\r\nbut the other had sunk in up to his knee. And this was the position in\r\nwhich he stood when the others turned.\r\n\r\nAnother minute and they were by his side, pulling at him. But as they\r\npulled, each one found himself sinking.\r\n\r\n“Here, boys, this won’t do,” cried Bart. “Phil, give me your hand. Boys,\r\nform a line behind me, one after another. Now let’s catch hold of one\r\nanother. Now, let’s keep moving backward and forward, quickly, #so as\r\nnot to stand still. Now, then, pull!”\r\n\r\nBackward and forward the line of boys, thus rapidly formed, went\r\nswaying, pulling Phil as they did so. The clinging mud yielded, and Phil\r\nwas slowly dragged forth. But his boot was left behind.\r\n\r\n“Never mind the boot,” cried Bart. “Come on as you are,--one shoe off,\r\nand the other one on, tol de roi de rido, my son John! Hurrah! Phil, go\r\nahead of me, and I’ll guard the rear.”\r\n\r\nAll this time, while Bart was speaking, they were running on, Phil\r\nlimping with his booted and bootless feet. .\r\n\r\n“Never mind, Phil! we’ll soon get to a place where you can take off the\r\nother boot,” said Bart, encouragingly.\r\n\r\nAnd now began the tug. Their run had been a long one, and their\r\nexertions excessive. All of them were out of breath, and panting\r\nheavily. The distance still before them was great; but they dared\r\nnot stop; they dared not even pause for am instant, or slacken their\r\nprogress in any degree. Phil was most exhausted, but he toiled on with\r\ndesperate exertions. The memory of his lost boot showed him his danger.\r\nThat boot left behind remained as a terror, which drove him on.\r\n\r\nOn and still on. Fainter grew the boys, but they dared not stop. All of\r\nthem were panting, and laboring heavily, but no relief was near. Far\r\noff still lay the marsh with its grass--a fearful distance to those so\r\nexhausted, and still compelled to labor so hard.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how much longer I can stand this,” gasped Tom.\r\n\r\n“You _must_ stand it! Don’t stop, for your life!” cried Bruce.\r\n\r\nThe others said nothing. To speak would be but to waste their precious\r\nbreath, which they were losing only too rapidly.\r\n\r\nOn and on. Still the soft mud lay beneath them, and an awful fear came\r\nto some of them that it was getting softer.\r\n\r\nThe fear was soon realized.\r\n\r\nSofter and softer it grew, and deeper sank their feet. Had this place\r\nonly been found at an earlier period, they could have returned, or they\r\nwould have had strength to struggle on; but now it came in the hour of\r\ntheir extremest exhaustion. It was a hollow in the mud, somewhat lower\r\nthan the surrounding surface.\r\n\r\n“We can’t go through this,” said Bruce; and he pointed to the centre\r\nof the hollow, which looked fearfully soft and liquid. “Let’s go around\r\nit;” and turning rapidly, he started off toward the right. The boys said\r\nnothing. They floundered deep in the mud,-they panted, they gasped, they\r\nmoaned in the despairing efforts which they made.\r\n\r\n“I’ll lie down,” gasped Phil. “I--won’t--sink--“.\r\n\r\n“On, on! Never! We’ll all have to die if you stop.”\r\n\r\nThese words came from Bart, who, exhausted as he was, caught Phil’s arm,\r\nand dragged him on.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Tom fell.\r\n\r\n“It’s all up with me, boys,” he moaned. “Leave me. Save yourselves.”\r\n\r\nBruce said nothing. He snatched him up out of the mud, and pulled him\r\nalong, while at this fresh exertion his whole frame quivered, and his\r\nfeet sank deeper.\r\n\r\nHow long could this last?\r\n\r\nTom could scarcely keep his feet. Phil could hardly keep upright, and\r\nmove his legs. Arthur could barely stumble along. Bart and Bruce bore.\r\nit best, and could help the others still.\r\n\r\nBut for how long?\r\n\r\nA shout of joy came from Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! Look there!” he cried. Tom raised himself by a last effort,\r\nand turned his feeble eyes to where Bruce pointed. He saw, at a little\r\ndistance, a green patch in the mud.\r\n\r\nIt was marsh grass!\r\n\r\nAt that instant all recognized it. The sight of it brought fresh\r\nstrength to their despairing energies. It gave new life to Tom and Phil.\r\nA few steps more, and the soft mud grew harder; and soon after they were\r\nall standing on the patch of marsh grass.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had they reached this place, than they all flung themselves\r\ndown upon the mud, out of which the coarse grass grew. For some time not\r\na word was spoken. All lay there breathing heavily. Looking back, they\r\ncould see the wide extent of mud flats which they had traversed.\r\nThe schooner was far away, and those on board could no longer be\r\ndistinguished. The soft spot in which they had been wallowing, and out\r\nof which they had found their way, spread for a great distance, not only\r\nbetween them and the schooner, but also on one side. Between them and\r\nCornwallis there appeared to be a firmer surface, like that which they\r\nhad found on leaving the schooner. Besides this, there were patches of\r\ngrass interspersed here and there, like islands, in this sea of mud.\r\nHere they might find resting-places if they were again exhausted. The\r\nspot on which they lay was the outermost of these.\r\n\r\nThey did not hurry away. They needed a good long breathing-time, and\r\nthey took it. Phil took off his remaining boot, declaring that if he\r\nhad only got it off before, he would not have been so exhausted. He\r\npreferred walking over the mud barefoot, he said. This seemed to the\r\nothers a good idea, and they all took off their boots and stockings, so\r\nas to pass over the mud more lightly.\r\n\r\nAt length, after about half an hour, they all rose, and resumed their\r\njourney. The mud spread away before them; and though there were patches\r\nof grass at intervals, yet the real marsh land itself did not come\r\nwithin half a mile of them. This distance would have to be traversed\r\nbefore they could reach the nearest verge. And now, keeping their eyes\r\nfixed upon the Cornwallis shore, they all set out afresh.\r\n\r\nTheir progress was easy, such as it was when they first set out, with\r\nthis difference, that their goal was near, and resting-places frequent.\r\nNearer and nearer they came to the marsh land; nearer and nearer\r\nstill,--and now they were close to it,--and now they had just reached\r\nit,--when suddenly, just as they seemed to touch it, there yawned\r\nbetween them and that green inviting goal a deep crevice, the course of\r\nsome sea current, at the bottom of which trickled, even now, some water,\r\nwhich probably came from one of the numerous drains of the dike land\r\nbefore them. The sides sloped down at an angle of forty-five degrees,\r\nand consisted of the softest mud, which seemed by its appearance ready\r\nto ingulf at once any one who might step upon it. To cross here was\r\nimpossible. It could not be even ventured upon.\r\n\r\nThe ground at the edge was firm enough for them to stand and survey\r\nthe situation. On the left the gully seemed to go toward the Cornwallis\r\nRiver, on the right it seemed to approach the land. Supposing that it\r\ncame from the dikes, and that it would grow narrower if they ascended\r\nin that direction, they turned off toward the right. They found their\r\nsurmise correct. After walking for a half mile, the gully had become\r\nmuch narrower, and had diminished from a width of thirty feet and a\r\ndepth of twelve, to a width of ten and a depth of six. But here they\r\nfound themselves at a fork, where the gully that came from the dike land\r\ndivided “itself, one part going toward the Cornwallis River, and the\r\nother far down through the mud flat toward the bay. To go around it, or\r\nin any way avoid it, was impossible. It was necessary to cross it at all\r\nhazards.\r\n\r\n“We must do it, boys,” said Bart. “So here goes.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he threw over his boots. Then he went back for some\r\ndistance. Then he rushed forward, and springing from the edge of the\r\nbank, he shot through the air, and landed on the other side.\r\n\r\n“That’s more than I can do,” said Tom. “I’ve got to wade it.”\r\n\r\n“Nor can I,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Go it, Arthur,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\nArthur went back, and took a run like Bart, and jumped. But he fell two\r\nfeet short. His feet sank deep into the soft mud. He struggled for a\r\nmoment, and falling forward, dug his elbows into the top of the bank.\r\nBart seized him, and after some violent struggles he was free.\r\n\r\nAfter this all the boots were thrown over. Bruce encouraged Phil and\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n“Now, boys, go it. I’ll wait here to help you.”\r\n\r\n“But we can’t jump.”\r\n\r\n“Arthur and I will go down on this side, and Bruce on the other, and\r\nhelp you,” said Bart; and he descended at the same time, followed by\r\nArthur, while Bruce descended the opposite side. Their feet sank in for\r\nsome distance, and then found bottom.\r\n\r\nPhil then went down, and gave a wild leap, and his feet just cleared\r\nthe middle. For a moment he floundered, but struggled onward, and caught\r\nBart’s hand. Another minute, and he was safe over.\r\n\r\n“I’ve not got much strength left, boys,” said Tom; “but I’ll do what I\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\n“Steady now--wait,” said Bart, “let me get a little farther down.\r\nArthur, give me your hand.” Saying this, Bart descended a little\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nTom ran down, his feet sinking deep. Near the middle he tried to leap\r\nover, but his feet sank so that his leap failed. He fell short, and his\r\nadvancing foot struck the very middle of that soft pudding in the bed of\r\nthe gully. He sank to his middle at once, struggling, and panting, and\r\nthrowing himself forward. Deeper and deeper he sank. It was an awful\r\nmoment. At length a last violent effort brought him a little nearer.\r\nBart dropped Arthur’s hand, and clutched that which was despairingly\r\noutstretched by Tom. At the same moment Arthur caught Bart, and they\r\ndragged at their sinking companion. For some time they did nothing\r\ntoward extricating him.\r\n\r\nBut now with a bound Bruce had sprung across, and hurried to their\r\nassistance. Going down close by Bart, he caught Tom’s other hand. Then,\r\nwith all their strength united, they pulled. Their own feet sank deep,\r\nbut they thought not of that. Tom was coming out. He was out. He was\r\nsaved!\r\n\r\nDrawing out their own feet then, they helped Tom up to the top of the\r\nbank, and there they rested once more. Tom was not exhausted, but\r\nonly weakened, and a few minutes were sufficient for him to rally.\r\nSo, without saying much about this last adventure, they resumed their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThere lay the marsh right before them at last. There, too, not far away,\r\nrose a dike, beyond which were the dike lands. Their perilous journey\r\nwas at last approaching an end. Soon they were on the marsh, where the\r\ncoarse grass was now in its early spring growth, and not high enough to\r\nimpede their progress. A short journey through this brought them to the\r\ndike. It was only a fe\\v feet in height. They climbed to the top, and\r\nlooked around. There was the Cornwallis River about half a mile away,\r\nand there, farther up, the bridge that crossed it. The coarse stubble of\r\nthe grass hurt their feet, so that they walked along the top of the\r\ndike toward the river. This walk was easy and pleasant; and after their\r\nsevere journey, it was even delightful. In this way they went on, till\r\nat last they reached the bank of the river, when they turned and walked\r\nup the edge toward the bridge.\r\n\r\nAt first the bed of the river was, as Bart had said, a vast abyss of\r\nsoft mud, through which ran a swift stream, flowing at the bottom of\r\nthis abyss; but as they walked on, they came at length to a place where\r\nthe mud was intermixed with gravel, which extended down to the water,\r\nand up on the other side. Here Bruce stopped, and looked down, and then\r\nacross. .\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked the others.\r\n\r\n“O, nothing. I’m thinking about trying to cross.”\r\n\r\n“To cross! You’ll never get across,” cried Phil.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart. “It can be done. I’ll try it if you will, Bruce. You\r\nsee it isn’t all soft mud here, but the gravel goes down, and up the\r\nother side. I don’t believe it’s deep, either.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if it’s over our heads, we can swim a little.”\r\n\r\n“But see how strong the current is,” said Tom. “It will carry you off.”\r\n\r\n“O, it can’t carry us far,” said Bruce. “I’m in for it. You see, boys,\r\nit’s too aggravating to look across the river here, and see the Academy\r\nclose by on the other side, hardly more than a mile or so away, and then\r\nturn off for a four or five mile walk around. You fellows had better go\r\nup to the bridge, and get a wagon, and drive round. Bart and 1 will try\r\nit here, at any rate. If we can’t get across, we’ll follow you.”\r\n\r\nWithout listening to any further remonstrances, Bruce and Bart descended\r\nthe slope. The bed was very wide and deep, though now nearly empty,\r\nand they did not know how deep the water might be that ran there. They\r\nexpected to ford it. The other boys stood on the bank watching them with\r\nintense interest.\r\n\r\nThe gravel, mixed with mud, formed a good footing; and Bruce and Bart\r\nstopped here for a time, and put their boots on, so that if they had to\r\nswim they might not be impeded with bundles.\r\n\r\nThe water was running swiftly by. It seemed wider now than it did at the\r\ntop of the bank. But they did not hesitate. In they went side by side,\r\nBruce on the right, and Bart below him on the left. The water grew\r\ndeeper and deeper. It came up to their waists, then up to their armpits.\r\nBart could not possibly stem it a moment longer. He was lifted from his\r\nfeet, and borne on.\r\n\r\nThose waiting at the top of the bank felt their hearts stop beating as\r\nthey looked.\r\n\r\nBut Bart’s head was above water, and he struck out bravely for the\r\nopposite shore. He knew he would not have far to swim, for he had\r\nalready gone nearly half way when he was swept off his feet. The current\r\nstill bore him down, but his own efforts were dragging him to the\r\nopposite shore at every stroke.\r\n\r\nAfter Bart had lost his footing, Bruce still walked on. He held himself\r\nso that he could resist the current to some extent. But at last he, too,\r\nlost his footing, and was swept after Bart. He struck out strongly; and\r\nwhile carried down by the current, he, too, drew nearer the opposite\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nBart had just touched bottom, and sprang up, with the water scarce\r\nhigher than his waist, and looked around for Bruce. As he looked, he\r\ncaught sight of Bruce’s face. It was turned toward him in agony, close\r\nby him, and but a little behind. Two hands were flung out, and with a\r\ngasp and a groan Bruce sank.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Bart stood petrified with horror. A wild thought of\r\nsharks flashed through his mind. But the next instant he had grasped\r\nBruce, and was dragging him half fainting, still gasping, out of the\r\nwater. In a few minutes they were on the bank, where they both sat down.\r\n\r\n“It was a--a palpitation--of the--the heart,” gasped Bruce. “I’ve\r\nfelt--queer.--ever since that--affair--on the--the cliff.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You’ll have to keep quiet, Bruce, for some months to come. You see\r\nyou’ve been exerting yourself tremendously to-day, and this last thing\r\nhas been too much. You’ve got to look out, for a thing like this is not\r\nto be trifled with.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the other boys had rushed down, and were on the opposite\r\nside halloing, and asking what was the matter.\r\n\r\n“O, nothing--a doldrum of Bruce’s,” cried Bart. “‘He’s all right now.”\r\n\r\n“All right!” said Bruce, lifting up his pale face, and nodding.\r\n\r\n“You hurry up, boys,” said Bart. “Get a horse at the bridge, and drive\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nUpon this the boys left, and went to the bridge. After about a quarter\r\nof an hour, Bruce felt able to start. They ascended the bank slowly; and\r\nafter reaching the dike land, they went across in a straight line\r\nfor the Academy. They walked slowly at first, but Bruce regained his\r\nstrength more and more at every step.\r\n\r\nAt length they reached the gateway of the Academy grounds. Wet to the\r\nskin, handkerchiefs round their heads, with their clothes ragged, and\r\nplastered with mud from head to foot, so that hardly any of the original\r\ncolor was visible, these two forlorn figures attracted universal\r\nattention; and soon all the small boys were around them cheering, and\r\nshouting, and asking about the schooner.\r\n\r\nOut came Mr. Long, who had arrived the previous evening without\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nOut came Dr. Porter, astonishment in his face.\r\n\r\nOut came every inhabitant of the Academy and its precincts, all making\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nAnd, last of all, out came Solomon, with an enormous white collar\r\nstanding up above his ears, and,--\r\n\r\n“O, de gracious! O, de sakes alive, now! What’s dis dat dis ole nigga\r\ndoes see! You gwine away whar glory takes you, an’ back agin to be de\r\nlight of an ole cuss’s life! An’ whar’s all de rest ob all dem bressed\r\nchil’en? O, dis de-lightful day an’ hour! An’ you wet as ebber wet kin\r\nbe by failin’ in de briny wave! Bress dis old nigga’s heart! but whar\r\nyou git all dat mud from? An’ me hopin’ an’ prayin’ fur dis glorious\r\ntime! What’s become ob all de Wenebble Breddren? Heah comes de Wenebble\r\nPatrick, an’ de Wenebble Wodden, wid de ‘Gran’ Panjydanderum in de\r\nshinin’ train! O, dis day an’ hour!”\r\n\r\nAnd with exclamations like these, poured forth with amazing volubility,\r\nSolomon walked along backward before them, and his voice died away, in\r\nthe distance to a prolonged and unintelligible hubble-bubble.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour afterward Arthur, Phil, and Tom drove up, and were\r\nreceived in a very similar manner. If the “B. O. W. C.” liked to create\r\na sensation, they certainly had reason to be satisfied.\r\n\r\nMr. Simmons, with the rest of the boys, did not get to the Academy till\r\nlate in the day.\r\n\r\nBut long before that, in fact, at high noon, Solomon received the “B. O.\r\nW. C.” in the diningroom. They had luxuriated in the bath, and Solomon\r\nhad prepared for them the banquet. He surpassed himself. His genius had\r\ninvented new dishes expressly for the occasion, and the “B. O. W. C.”\r\n ate, and were refreshed.\r\n\r\nTHE END",
