The tide was high, the turbid\r\nwaters of Mud Creek flowed around, a fresh breeze blew, and if any\r\ncraft was going to sea she could not have found a better time.  The\r\ncrowd consisted chiefly of boys, though a few men were mingled with\r\nthem.  These boys were from Grand Pre School, and are all old\r\nacquaintances.  There was the stalwart frame of Bruce, the Roman face\r\nof Arthur, the bright eyes of Bart, the slender frame of Phil, and the\r\nearnest glance of Tom.  There, too, was Pat's merry smile, and the\r\nstolid look of Bogud, and the meditative solemnity of Jiggins, not to\r\nspeak of others whose names need not be mentioned.  Amid the crowd the\r\nface of Captain Corbet was conspicuous, and the dark visage of Solomon,\r\nwhile that of the mate was distinguishable in the distance.  To all\r\nthese the good schooner Antelope formed the centre of attraction, and\r\nalso of action.  It was on board of her that the chief bustle took\r\nplace, and towards her that all eyes were turned.\r\n\r\nThe good schooner Antelope had made several voyages during the past few\r\nmonths, and now presented herself to the eye of the spectator not much\r\nchanged from her former self.  A fine fresh coat of coal tar had but\r\nrecently ornamented her fair exterior, while a coat of whitewash inside\r\nthe hold had done much to drive away the odor of the fragrant potato.\r\nRigging and sails had been repaired as well as circumstances would\r\npermit, and in the opinion of her gallant captain she was eminently\r\nseaworthy.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion things bore the appearance of a voyage. Trunks\r\nwere passed on board and put below, together with coats, cloaks,\r\nbedding, and baskets of provisions.  The deck was strewn about with the\r\nmultifarious requisites of a ship's company.  The Antelope, at that\r\ntime, seemed in part an emigrant vessel, with a dash of the yacht and\r\nthe coasting schooner.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, two gentlemen worked their way through the\r\ncrowd to the edge of the wharf.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys,\" said one, \"well, captain, what's the meaning of all this?\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet started at this, and looked up from a desperate effort\r\nto secure the end of one of the sails.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Dr. Porter!\" said he; \"why, doctor!--how d'ye do?--and Mr. Long,\r\ntoo!--why, railly!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys also stopped their work, and looked towards their teachers\r\nwith a little uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"What's all this?\" said Dr. Porter, looking around with a smile; \"are\r\nyou getting up another expedition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, no,\" said Captain Corbet, \"not 'xactly; fact is, we're kine o'\r\ngoin to take a vyge deoun the bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Down the bay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  You see the boys kine o' want to go home by water, rayther than\r\nby land.\"\r\n\r\n\"By water!  Home by water!\" repeated Mr. Long, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Captain Corbet; \"an bein as the schewner was in good\r\nrepair, an corked, an coal-tarred, an whitewashed up fust rate, I kine\r\no' thought it would redound to our mootooil benefit if we went off on\r\nsich a excursion,--bein pleasanter, cheaper, comfortabler, an every way\r\npreferable to a land tower.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hem,\" said Dr. Porter, looking uneasily about.  \"I don't altogether\r\nlike it.  Boys, what does it all mean?\"\r\n\r\nThus appealed to, Bart became spokesman for the boys.\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir,\" said he, \"we thought we'd like to go home by water--that's\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go home by water!\" repeated the doctor once more, with a curious smile.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? by the Bay of Fundy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, there are only a few of us.  Bruce, and Arthur, and Tom,\r\nand Phil, and Pat, besides myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bruce and Arthur?\" said the doctor; \"are they going home by the Bay of\r\nFundy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bart, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how they can get to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Prince\r\nEdward's Island from the Bay of Fundy,\" said the doctor, \"without going\r\nround Nova Scotia, and that will be a journey of many hundred miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no, sir,\" said Bruce; \"we are going first to Moncton.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, is that the idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where will you go from Moncton?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Shediac, and then home.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you going to Newfoundland by that route, Tom?\" asked the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"From Shediac?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never knew before that there were vessels going from Shediac to\r\nNewfoundland.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I'm going to Prince Edward's Island first, sir, with Bruce and\r\nArthur,\" said Tom.  \"I'll find my way home from there.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you'll find it a long journey before you reach home. Won't\r\nyour friends be anxious?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no, sir.  I wrote that I wanted to visit Bruce and Arthur, and they\r\ngave me leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Phil, are you going home by the Antelope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going exactly in a straight line away from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you are.  This isn't the way to Chester.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, you see I'm going to visit Bart at St. John.\"\r\n\r\n\"O,  I understand.  And that is your plan, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bart.  \"Pat is going too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going first?\"\r\n\r\n\"First, sir, we will sail to the Petitcodiac River, and go up it as far\r\nas Moncton, where Bruce, and Arthur, and Tom will leave us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will go to St. John, where Phil, and Pat, and I will leave\r\nher.  Solomon, too, will leave her there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Solomon!\" cried the doctor.  \"What!  Solomon!  Is Solomon going? Why,\r\nwhat can I do without Solomon?  Here!  Hallo!--Solomon!  What in the\r\nworld's the meaning of all this?\"\r\n\r\nThus summoned, Solomon came forth from the cabin, into which he had\r\ndived at the first appearance of the doctor.  His eyes were downcast,\r\nhis face was demure, his attitude and manner were abject.\r\n\r\n\"Solomon,\" said the doctor, \"what's this I hear?  Are you going to St.\r\nJohn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ony temp'ly, sah--jist a leetle visit, sah,\" said Solomon, very\r\nhumbly, stealing looks at the boys from his downcast eyes.\r\n\r\n\"But what makes you go off this way without asking, or letting me know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I, sah?\" said Solomon, rolling his eyes up as though horrified at\r\nhis own wickedness; \"the sakes now!  Declar, I clean forgot it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going away for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sah, for de good oh my helf.  Docta vises sea vyge; sides, I got\r\nfrens in St. John, an business dar, what muss be tended to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said the doctor, \"I suppose if you want to go you'll find\r\nreasons enough; but at the same time you ought to have let me known\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Darsn't, sah,\" said Solomon.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fraid you'd not let me go,\" said Solomon, with a broad grin, that\r\ninstantly was suppressed by a demure cough.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said the doctor; and then turning away, he spoke a few\r\nwords apart with Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys,\" said the doctor, at last, \"this project of yours doesn't\r\nseem to me to be altogether safe, and I don't like to trust you in this\r\nway without anybody as a responsible guardian.\"\r\n\r\nBart smiled.\r\n\r\n\"O, sir,\" said he, \"you need not be at all uneasy.  All of us are\r\naccustomed to take care of ourselves; and besides, if you wanted a\r\nresponsible guardian for us, what better one could be found than\r\nCaptain Corbet?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor and Mr. Long both shook their heads.   Evidently neither of\r\nthem attached any great importance to Captain Corbet's guardianship.\r\n\r\n\"Did you tell your father how you were going?\" asked the doctor, after\r\na few further words with Mr. Long.\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, sir; and he told me I might go.  What's more, he promised to\r\ncharter a schooner for me to cruise about with Phil and Pat after I\r\narrived home.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we got permission, too,\" said Bruce.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" said the doctor.  \"That changes the appearance of things. I\r\nwas afraid that it was a whim of your own.  And now, one thing\r\nmore,--how are you off for provisions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, sir,\" said Captain Corbet, \"I've made my calculations, an I think\r\nI've got enough.  What I might fail in, the boys and Solomon have made\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it, Solomon?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\nSolomon grinned.\r\n\r\n\"You sleep in the hold, I see,\" continued the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bruce.  \"It's whitewashed, and quite sweet now. We'll\r\nonly be on board two or three days at the farthest, and so it really\r\ndoesn't much matter how we go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys, I have no more to say; only take care of yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words the doctor and Mr. Long bade them good by, and then\r\nwalked away.\r\n\r\nThe other boys, however, stood on the wharf waiting to see the vessel\r\noff.  They themselves were all going to start for home in a few\r\nminutes, and were only waiting for the departure of the Antelope.\r\n\r\nThis could not now be long delayed.  The tide was high.  The wind fresh\r\nand fair.  The luggage, and provisions, and stores were all on board.\r\nCaptain Corbet was at the helm.  All was ready.  At length the word was\r\ngiven, the lines were cast off; and the Antelope moved slowly round,\r\nand left the wharf amid the cheers of the boys.  Farther and farther it\r\nmoved away, then down the tortuous channel of Mud Creek, until at last\r\nthe broad expanse of Minas Basin received them.\r\n\r\nFor this voyage the preparations had been complete.  It had first been\r\nthought of several weeks before, and then the plan and the details had\r\nbeen slowly elaborated.  It was thought to be an excellent idea, and\r\none which was in every respect worthy of the \"B. O. W. C.\"  Captain\r\nCorbet embraced the proposal with enthusiasm. Letters home, requesting\r\npermission, received favorable answers. Solomon at first resisted, but\r\nfinally, on being solemnly appealed to as Grand Panjandrum, he found\r\nhimself unable to withstand, and thus everything was gradually\r\nprepared.  Other details were satisfactorily arranged, though not\r\nwithout much serious and earnest debate.  The question of costume\r\nreceived very careful attention, and it was decided to adopt and wear\r\nthe weather-beaten uniforms that had done service amidst mud and water\r\non a former occasion. Solomon's presence was felt to be a security\r\nagainst any menacing famine; and that assurance was made doubly sure by\r\nthe presence of a cooking stove, which Captain Corbet, mindful of\r\nformer hardships, had thoughtfully procured and set up in the hold.\r\nFinally, it was decided that the flag which had formerly flaunted the\r\nbreeze should again wave over them; and so it was, that as the Antelope\r\nmoved through Mud Creek, like a thing of life, the black flag of the\r\n\"B. O. W. C.\" floated on high, with its blazonry of a skull, which now,\r\nworn by time, looked more than ever like the face of some mild,\r\nvenerable, and paternal monitor.\r\n\r\nSome time was taken up in arranging the hold.  Considerable confusion\r\nwas manifest in that important locality.  Tin pans were intermingled\r\nwith bedding, provisions with wearing apparel, books with knives and\r\nforks, while amid the scene the cooking stove towered aloft prominent.\r\nTo tell the truth, the scene was rather free and easy than elegant; nor\r\ncould an unprejudiced observer have called it altogether comfortable.\r\nIn fact, to one who looked at it with a philosophic mind, an air of\r\nsqualor might possibly have been detected.  Yet what of that?  The\r\nphilosophic mind just alluded to would have overlooked the squalor, and\r\nregarded rather the health, the buoyant animal spirits, and the\r\ndetermined habit of enjoyment, which all the ship's company evinced,\r\nwithout exception.  The first thing which they did in the way of\r\npreparation for the voyage was to doff the garments of civilized life,\r\nand to don the costume of the \"B. O. W. C.\"  Those red shirts,\r\ndecorated with a huge white cross on the back, had been washed and\r\nmended, and completely reconstructed, so that the rents and patches\r\nwhich were here and there visible on their fair exteriors, served as\r\nmementos of former exploits, and called up associations of the past\r\nwithout at all deteriorating from the striking effect of the present.\r\nGlengary bonnets adorned their heads, and served to complete the\r\ncostume.\r\n\r\nThe labor of dressing was followed by a hurried arrangement of the\r\ntrunks and bedding; after which they all emerged from the hold and\r\nascending to the deck, looked around upon the scene.  Above, the sky\r\nwas blue and cloudless, and between them and the blue sky floated the\r\nflag, from whose folds the face looked benignantly down.  The tide was\r\nnow on the ebb, and as the wind was fair, both wind and tide united to\r\nbear them rapidly onward.  Before them was Blomidon, while all around\r\nwas the circling sweep of the shores of Minas Bay.  A better day for a\r\nstart could not have been found, and everything promised a rapid and\r\npleasant run.\r\n\r\n\"I must say,\" remarked Captain Corbet, who had for some time been\r\nstanding buried in his own meditations at the helm,--\"I must say, boys,\r\nthat I don't altogether regret bein once more on the briny deep.  There\r\nwas a time,\" he continued, meditatively, \"when I kine o' anticipated\r\ngivin up this here occypation, an stayin to hum a nourishin of the\r\ninfant.  But man proposes, an woman disposes, as the sayin is,--an you\r\nsee what I'm druv to.  It's a great thing for a man to have a companion\r\nof sperrit, same as I have, that keeps a' drivin an a drivin at him,\r\nand makes him be up an doin.  An now, I declar, if I ain't gittin to be\r\na confirmed wanderer agin, same as I was in the days of my halcyon an\r\nshinin youth.  Besides, I have a kine o' feelin as if I'd be a\r\ncontinewin this here the rest of all my born days.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you won't feel homesick,\" remarked Bart, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"Homesick,\" repeated the captain.  \"Wal, you see thar's a good deal to\r\nbe said about it.  In my hum thar's a attraction, but thar's also a\r\nrepulsion.  The infant drors me hum, the wife of my buzzum drives me\r\naway, an so thar it is, an I've got to knock under to the strongest\r\npower.  An that's the identical individool thing that makes the aged\r\nCorbet a foogitive an a vagabond on the face of the mighty deep.  Still\r\nI have my consolations.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain paused for a few moments, and then resumed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he continued, \"I have my consolations.  Surroundins like these\r\nhere air a consolation.  I like your young faces, an gay an airy ways,\r\nboys.  I like to see you enjoy life.  So, go in.  Pitch in.  Go ahead.\r\nSing.  Shout.  Go on like mad.  Carry on like all possessed, an you'll\r\nfind the aged Corbet smilin amid the din, an a flutterin of his\r\nvenerable locks triumphant amid the ragin an riotin elements.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a comfort to know that, at any rate,\" said Tom.  \"We'll give you\r\nenough of that before we leave, especially as we know it don't annoy\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how it is,\" said the captain, solemnly, \"but I begin to\r\nfeel a sort of somethin towards you youngsters that's very absorbin.\r\nIt's a kine o' anxious fondness, with a mixtoor of indulgent\r\ntenderness.  How ever I got to contract sech a feelin beats me.  I\r\ns'pose it's bein deprived of my babby, an exiled from home, an so my\r\nvacant buzzom craves to be filled.  I've got a dreadful talent for doin\r\nthe pariential, an what's more, not only for doin the pariential, but\r\nfor feelin of it.  So you boys, ef ever you see me a doin of the\r\npariential towards youns, please remember that when I act like an\r\nanxious an too indulgent parient towards youns, it's because I feel\r\nlike one.\"\r\n\r\nFor some hours they traversed the waters, carried swiftly on by the\r\nunited forces of the wind and tide.  At last they found themselves\r\nclose by Blomidon, and under his mighty shadow they sailed for some\r\ntime.  Then they doubled the cape, and there, before them, lay a long\r\nchannel--the Straits of Minas, through which the waters pour at every\r\nebb and flood.  Their course now lay through this to the Bay of Fundy\r\noutside; and as it was within two hours of the low tide, the current\r\nran swiftly, hurrying them rapidly past the land. Here the scene was\r\ngrand and impressive in the extreme.  On one side arose a lofty,\r\nprecipitous cliff, which extended for miles, its sides scarred and\r\ntempest-torn, its crest fringed with trees, towering overhead many\r\nhundreds of feet, black, and menacing, and formidable.  At its base was\r\na steep beach, disclosed by the retreating tide, which had been formed\r\nby the accumulated masses of rock that had fallen in past ages from the\r\ncliffs above.  These now, from the margin of the water up to high-water\r\nmark, were covered with a vast growth of sea-weed, which luxuriated\r\nhere, and ran parallel to the line of vegetation on the summit of the\r\ncliff. On the other side of the strait the scene was different.  Here\r\nthe shores were more varied; in one place, rising high on steep\r\nprecipices, in others, thrusting forth black, rocky promontories into\r\nthe deep channel; in others again, retreating far back, and forming\r\nbays, round whose sloping shores appeared places fit for human\r\nhabitation, and in whose still waters the storm-tossed bark might find\r\na secure haven.\r\n\r\nAs they drifted on, borne along by the impetuous tide, the shores on\r\neither side changed, and new vistas opened before them.  At last they\r\nreached the termination of the strait, the outer portal of this long\r\navenue, which here was marked by the mighty hand of Nature in\r\nconspicuous characters.  For here was the termination of that long\r\nextent of precipitous cliff which forms the outline of Blomidon; and\r\nthis termination, abrupt, and stern, and black, shows, in a\r\nconcentrated form, the power of wind and wave.  The cliff ends abrupt,\r\nbroken off short, and beyond this arise from the water several giant\r\nfragments of rock, the first of which, shaped like an irregular\r\npyramid, rivals the cliff itself in height, and is surrounded by other\r\nrocky fragments, all of which form a colossal group, whose aggregated\r\neffect never fails to overawe the mind of the spectator.  Such is Cape\r\nSplit, the terminus of Cape Blomidon, on the side of the Bay of Fundy.\r\nOver its shaggy summits now fluttered hundreds of sea-gulls; round its\r\nblack base the waves foamed and thundered, while the swift tide poured\r\nbetween the interstices of the rugged rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Behind that thar rock,\" said Captain Corbet, pointing to Cape Split,\r\n\"is a place they call Scott's Bay.  Perhaps some of you have heard tell\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a faint recollection of such a place,\" said Bart.  \"Scott's\r\nBay, do you call it?  Yes, that must be the place that I've heard of;\r\nand is it behind this cape?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bay that runs up thar,\" said the captain.  \"We'll see it soon\r\narter we get further down.  It's a fishin and ship-buildin place.  They\r\ncatch a dreadful lot of shad thar sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nSwiftly the Antelope passed on, hurried on by the tide, and no longer\r\nfeeling much of the wind; swiftly she passed by the cliffs, and by the\r\ncape, and onward by the sloping shores, till at length the broad bosom\r\nof the Bay of Fundy extended before their eyes. Here the wind ceased\r\naltogether, the water was smooth and calm, but the tide still swept\r\nthem along, and the shores on each side receded, until at length they\r\nwere fairly in the bay.  Here, on one side, the coast of Nova Scotia\r\nspread away, until it faded from view in the distance, while on the\r\nother side the coast of New Brunswick extended.  Between the schooner\r\nand this latter coast a long cape projected, while immediately in front\r\narose a lofty island of rock, whose summit was crowned with trees.\r\n\r\n\"What island is that?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Captain Corbet, \"is Isle o' Holt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I've heard it called Ile Haute,\" said Bart.\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" said Captain Corbet, \"ony I believe it was named after\r\nthe man that diskivered it fust, an his name was Holt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's a French name,\" said Tom; \"Ile Haute means high island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, mebbe he was a Frenchman,\" said Captain Corbet.  \"I won't\r\nargufy--I dare say he was.  There used to be a heap o' Frenchmen about\r\nthese parts, afore we got red of 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a black, gloomy, dismal, and wretched-looking place,\" said Tom,\r\nafter some minutes of silent survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFirst Sight of a Place destined to be better known.--A Fog\r\nMill.--Navigation without Wind.--Fishing.--Boarding.--Under\r\nArrest.--Captain Corbet defiant.--The Revenue Officials frowned\r\ndown.--Corbet triumphant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Antelope had left the wharf at about seven in the morning.  It was\r\nnow one o'clock.  For the last two or three hours there had been but\r\nlittle wind, and it was the tide which had carried her along.  Drifting\r\non in this way, they had come to within a mile of Ile Haute, and had an\r\nopportunity of inspecting the place which Tom had declared to be so\r\ngloomy.  In truth, Tom's judgment was not undeserved.  Ile Haute arose\r\nlike a solid, unbroken rock out of the deep waters of the Bay of Fundy,\r\nits sides precipitous, and scarred by tempest, and shattered by frost.\r\nOn its summit were trees, at its base lay masses of rock that had\r\nfallen.  The low tide disclosed here, as at the base of Blomidon, a\r\nvast growth of black sea-weed, which covered all that rocky shore.  The\r\nupper end of the island, which was nearest them, was lower, however,\r\nand went down sloping to the shore, forming a place where a landing\r\ncould easily be effected.  From this shore mud flats extended into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"This end looks as though it had been cleared,\" said Bart.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it was,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Does anybody live here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did any one ever live here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, once, some one tried it, I believe, but gave it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it belong to anybody, or is it public property?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I dare say it belongs to somebody, if you could only get him to\r\nclaim it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, captain,\" said Bruce, \"how much longer are we going to drift?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, not much longer.  The tide's about on the turn, and we'll have a\r\nleetle change.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! will we drift back again?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I shouldn't wonder if we had a leetle wind afore long.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if we don't, will we drift back again into the Basin of Minas?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, dear, no.  We can anchor hereabouts somewhar.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't anchor by this island,--will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, dear, no.  We'll have a leetle driftin first.\"  As the captain\r\nspoke, he looked earnestly out upon the water.\r\n\r\n\"Thar she comes,\" he cried at last, pointing over the water.  The boys\r\nlooked, and saw the surface of the bay all rippled over.  They knew the\r\nsigns of wind, and waited for the result.  Soon a faint puff came up\r\nthe bay, which filled the languid sails, and another puff came up more\r\nstrongly, and yet another, until at length a moderate breeze was\r\nblowing.  The tide no longer dragged them on. It was on the turn; and\r\nas the vessel caught the wind, it yielded to the impetus, and moved\r\nthrough the water, heading across the bay towards the New Brunswick\r\nshore, in such a line as to pass near to that cape which has already\r\nbeen spoken of.\r\n\r\n\"If the wind holds out,\" said Captain Corbet, \"so as to carry us past\r\nCape d'Or, we can drift up with this tide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's Cape d'Or?\"\r\n\r\n\"That there,\" said Captain Corbet, pointing to the long cape which\r\nstretched between them and the New Brunswick shore.  \"An if it goes\r\ndown, an we can't get by the cape, we'll be able, at any rate, to drop\r\nanchor there, an hold on till the next tide.\"\r\n\r\nThe returning tide, and the fresh breeze that blew now, bore them\r\nonward rapidly, and they soon approached Cape d'Or.  They saw that it\r\nterminated in a rocky cliff, with rocky edges jutting forth, and that\r\nall the country adjoining was wild and rugged.  But the wind, having\r\ndone this much for them, now began to seem tired of favoring them, and\r\nonce more fell off.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like this,\" said Captain Corbet, looking around.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"All this here,\" said he, pointing to the shore.\r\n\r\nIt was about a mile away, and the schooner, borne along now by the\r\ntide, was slowly drifting on to an unpleasant proximity to the rocky\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we've got to anchor,\" said Captain Corbet; \"there's no help\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n\"To anchor?\" said Bruce, in a tone of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, anchor; we've got to do it,\" repeated the captain, in a decided\r\ntone.  The boys saw that there was no help for it, for the vessel was\r\nevery moment drawing in closer to the rocks; and though it would not\r\nhave been very dangerous for her to run ashore in that calm water, yet\r\nit would not have been pleasant.  So they suppressed their\r\ndisappointment, and in a few minutes the anchor was down, and the\r\nschooner's progress was stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Thar's one secret,\" said the captain, \"of navigatin in these here\r\nwaters, an that is, to use your anchor.  My last anchor I used for nigh\r\non thirty year, till it got cracked.  I mayn't be much on land, but put\r\nme anywhars on old Fundy, an I'm to hum.  I know every current on these\r\nhere waters, an can foller my nose through the thickest fog that they\r\never ground out at old Manan.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Bart.  \"What did you say about grinding out fog?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, nothin, ony thar's an island down the bay, you know, called Grand\r\nManan, an seafarin men say that they've got a fog mill down thar, whar\r\nthey grind out all the fog for the Bay of Fundy.  I can't say as ever\r\nI've seen that thar mill, but I've allus found the fog so mighty thick\r\ndown thar that I think thar's a good deal in the story.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we'll lose this tide,\" said Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm afeard so,\" said the captain, looking around over the water.\r\n\"This here wind ain't much, any way; you never can reckon on winds in\r\nthis bay.  I don't care much about them.  I'd a most just as soon go\r\nabout the bay without sails as with them.  What I brag on is the tides,\r\nan a jodgmatical use of the anchor.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not in earnest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Course I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you get to St. John from Grand Pre without sails?\"\r\n\r\n\"Course I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how you could manage to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do it?  Easy enough,\" said the captain.  \"You see I'd leave with the\r\nebb tide, and get out into the bay.  Then I'd anchor an wait till the\r\nnext ebb, an so on.  Bless your hearts, I've often done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you couldn't get across the bay by drifting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Course I could.  I'd work my way by short drifts over as far as this,\r\nan then I'd gradually move along till I kine o' canted over to the New\r\nBrunswick shore.  It takes time to do it, course it does; but what I\r\nmean to say is this--it CAN be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't like to be on board while you were trying to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe not.  I ain't invitin you to do it, either.  All I was sayin is,\r\nit CAN be done.  Sails air very good in their way, course they air, an\r\nwho's objectin to 'em?  I'm only sayin that in this here bay thar's\r\nthings that's more important than sails, by a long chalk--such as\r\ntides, an anchors in particular.  Give me them thar, an I don't care a\r\nhooter what wind thar is.\"\r\n\r\nLying thus at anchor, under the hot sun, was soon found to be rather\r\ndull, and the boys sought in vain for some way of passing the time.\r\nDifferent amusements were invented for the occasion. The first\r\namusement consisted in paper boats, with which they ran races, and the\r\ndrift of these frail vessels over the water afforded some excitement.\r\nThen they made wooden boats with huge paper sails.  In this last Bart\r\nshowed a superiority to the others; for, by means of a piece of iron\r\nhoop, which he inserted as a keel, he produced a boat which was able to\r\ncarry an immense press of sail, and in the faint and scarce perceptible\r\nbreeze, easily distanced the others.  This accomplishment Bart owed to\r\nhis training in a seaport town.\r\n\r\nAt length one of them proposed that they should try to catch fish.\r\nCaptain Corbet, in answer to their eager inquiries, informed them that\r\nthere were fish everywhere about the bay; on learning which they became\r\neager to try their skill.  Some herring were on board, forming part of\r\nthe stores, and these were taken for bait.  Among the miscellaneous\r\ncontents of the cabin a few hooks were found, which were somewhat\r\nrusty, it is true, yet still good enough for the purpose before them.\r\nLines, of course, were easily procured, and soon a half dozen baited\r\nhooks were down in the water, while a half dozen boys, eager with\r\nsuspense, watched the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nFor a half hour they held their lines suspended without any result; but\r\nat the end of that time, a cry from Phil roused them, and on looking\r\nround they saw him clinging with all his might to his line, which was\r\ntugged at tightly by something in the water.  Bruce ran to help him,\r\nand soon their united efforts succeeded in landing on the deck of the\r\nvessel a codfish of very respectable size.  The sight of this was\r\ngreeted with cheers by the others, and served to stimulate them to\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nAfter this others were caught, and before half an hour more some twenty\r\ncodfish, of various sizes, lay about the deck, as trophies of their\r\npiscatory skill.  They were now more excited than ever, and all had\r\ntheir hooks in the water, and were waiting eagerly for a bite, when an\r\nexclamation from Captain Corbet roused them.\r\n\r\nOn turning their heads, and looking in the direction where he was\r\npointing, they saw a steamboat approaching them.  It was coming from\r\nthe head of the bay on the New Brunswick side, and had hitherto been\r\nconcealed by the projecting cape.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" said Bart.  \"Is it the St. John steamer?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, SIR,\" said the captain.  \"She's a man-o'-war steamer--the revenoo\r\ncutter, I do believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, by her shape.\"\r\n\r\n\"She seems to be coming this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, bound to Minas Bay, I s'pose.  Wal, wal, wal! strange too,--how\r\nsingoolarly calm an onterrified I feel in'ardly.  Why, boys, I've seen\r\nthe time when the sight of a approachin revenoo vessel would make me\r\nshiver an shake from stem to starn.  But now how changed!  Such, my\r\nfriends, is the mootability of human life!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys looked at the steamer for a few moments, but at length went\r\nback to their fishing.  The approaching steamer had nothing in it to\r\nexcite curiosity: such an object was too familiar to withdraw their\r\nthoughts from the excitement of their lines and hooks, and the hope\r\nwhich each had of surpassing the other in the number of catches\r\nanimated them to new trials.  So they soon forgot all about the\r\napproaching steamer.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Corbet had nothing else to do, and so, whether it was on\r\naccount of his lack of employment, or because of the sake of old\r\nassociations, he kept his eyes fixed on the steamer.  Time passed on,\r\nand in the space of another half hour she had drawn very near to the\r\nAntelope.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Captain Corbet slapped his hand against his thigh.\r\n\r\n\"Declar, if they ain't a goin to overhaul us!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nAt this the boys all turned again to look at the steamer.\r\n\r\n\"Declar, if that fellow in the gold hat ain't a squintin at us through\r\nhis spy-glass!\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\nAs the boys looked, they saw that the Antelope had become an object of\r\nsingular attention and interest to those on board of the steamer.  Men\r\nwere on the forecastle, others on the main deck, the officers were on\r\nthe quarter-deck, and all were earnestly scrutinizing the Antelope.\r\nOne of them was looking at her through his glass.  The Antelope, as she\r\nlay at anchor, was now turned with her stern towards the steamer, and\r\nher sails flapping idly against the masts.  In a few moments the\r\npaddles of the steamer stopped, and at the same instant a gun was fired.\r\n\r\n\"Highly honored, kind sir,\" said Captain Corbet, with a grin.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Bart.\r\n\r\n\"Matter?  Why that thar steamer feels kine o' interested in us, an that\r\nthar gun means, HEAVE TO.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to heave to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nary heave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't come it no how; cos why, I'm hove to, with the anchor hard and\r\nfast, ony they can't see that we're anchored.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly a cry came over the water from a man on the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\n\"Ship aho-o-o-o-o-oy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hel-lo-o-o-o-o!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the informal reply of Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"Heave to-o-o-o, till I send a boat aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hoo-r-a-a-a-a-ay!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was again Captain Corbet's cheerful and informal answer.\r\n\r\n\"Wal! wal wal!\" he exclaimed, \"it does beat my grandmother--they're\r\ngoin to send a boat aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet grinned, and shook his head, and chuckled very\r\nvehemently, but said nothing.  He appeared to be excessively amused\r\nwith his own thoughts.  The boys looked at the steamer, and then at\r\nCaptain Corbet, in some wonder; but as he said nothing, they were\r\nsilent, and waited to see what was going to happen.  Meanwhile Solomon,\r\nroused from some mysterious culinary duties by the report of the gun,\r\nhad scrambled upon the deck, and stood with the others looking out over\r\nthe water at the steamer.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the steamer's boat was launched, and a half dozen\r\nsailors got in, followed by an officer.  Then they put off, and rowed\r\nwith vigorous strokes towards the schooner.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet watched the boat for some time in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Cur'ouser an cur'ouser,\" he said, at length.  \"I've knowed the time,\r\nboys, when sech an incident as this, on the briny deep, would have\r\nfairly keeled me over, an made me moot, an riz every har o' my head;\r\nbut look at me now.  Do I tremble? do I shake?  Here, feel my pulse.\"\r\n\r\nPhil, who stood nearest, put his finger on the outstretched wrist of\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\n\"Doos it beat?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Course it beats; but then it ony beats nateral.  You ain't feelin the\r\nright spot--the humane pulse not bein sitooated on the BACK of the\r\nhand,\" he added mildly, \"but here;\" and he removed Phil's inexperienced\r\nfinger to the place where the pulse lies.  \"Thar, now,\" he added, \"as\r\nthat pulse beats now, even so it beat a half hour ago, before that thar\r\nsteamer hev in sight.  Why, boys, I've knowed the time when this humane\r\npulse bet like all possessed.  You see, I've lived a life of adventoor,\r\nin spite of my meek and quiet natoor, an hev dabbled at odd times in\r\nthe smugglin business.  But they don't catch me this time--I've retired\r\nfrom that thar, an the Antelope lets the revenoo rest in peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat drew nearer and nearer, and the officer at the stern looked\r\nscrutinizingly at the Antelope.  There was an air of perplexity about\r\nhis face, which was very visible to those on board, and the perplexity\r\ndeepened and intensified as his eyes rested on the flag of the \"B. O.\r\nW. C.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave him to me,\" said Captain Corbet.  \"Leave that thar young man to\r\nme.  I enjy havin to do with a revenoo officer jest now; so don't go an\r\nput in your oars, but jest leave him to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, captain; we won't say a word,\" said Bruce.  \"We'll go on\r\nwith our fishing quietly.  Come, boys--look sharp, and down with your\r\nlines.\"\r\n\r\nThe interest which they had felt in these new proceedings had caused\r\nthe boys to pull up their hooks; but now, at Bruce's word, they put\r\nthem in the water once more, and resumed their fishing, only casting\r\nsidelong glances at the approaching boat.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the boat was alongside, and the officer leaped on\r\nboard.  He looked all around, at the fish lying about the deck, at the\r\nboys engaged in fishing, at Captain Corbet, at Solomon, at the\r\nmysterious flag aloft, and finally at the boys.  These all took no\r\nnotice of him, but appeared to be intent on their task.\r\n\r\n\"What schooner is this?\" he asked, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"The schooner Antelope, Corbet master,\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the master?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you belong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Grand Pre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grand Pre?\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm,\" he replied, with a stare around--\"Grand Pre--ah---hm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, jest so.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I briefly remarked that it was jest so.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the reason you didn't lie to, when you were hailed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lay to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked the officer, who was rather ireful,\r\nand somewhat insulting in his manner.\r\n\r\n\"Wal bein as I was anchored here hard an fast, I don't exactly see how\r\nI could manage to go through that thar manoeuvre, unless you'd kindly\r\nlend me the loan of your steam ingine to do it on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, old man; you'd better look out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I dew try to keep a good lookout.  How much'll you take for the\r\nloan o' that spy-glass o' yourn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see your papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hain't got none.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hain't got none.\"\r\n\r\n\"You--haven't--any--papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nary paper.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer's brow grew dark.  He looked around the vessel once more,\r\nand then looked frowningly at Captain Corbet, who encountered his\r\nglance with a serene smile.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, old man,\" said he; \"you can't come it over me.  Your little\r\ngame's up, old fellow.  This schooner's seized.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seized?  What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"For violation of the law, by fishing within the limits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Limits?  What limits?\"\r\n\r\n\"No foreign vessel can come within three miles of the shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foreign vessel?  Do you mean to call me a foreigner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do.  You're a Yankee fisherman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you are; and what do you mean by that confounded rag up\r\nthere?\" cried the officer, pointing to the flag of the \"B. O. W. C.\"\r\n\"If you think you can fish in this style, you'll find yourself\r\nmistaken.  I know too much about this business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you? Well, then, kind sir, allow me to mention that you've got\r\nsomethin to larn yet--spite o' your steam injines an spy-glasses.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" cried the officer, furious.  \"I'll let you know.  I\r\narrest you, and this vessel is seized.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, young sir,\" cried Captain Corbet; \"not QUITE so fast,\r\nEF you please.  You'll get YOURSELF arrested.  What do you mean by this\r\nhere?  Do you know who I am?  I, sir, am a subject of Queen Victory.\r\nMy home is here.  I'm now on my own natyve shore. A foreigner, am I?\r\nLet me tell you, sir, that I was born, brung up, nourished, married, an\r\nsettled in this here province, an I've got an infant born here, an I'm\r\nnot a fisherman, an this ain't a fishin vessel.  You arrest me ef you\r\ndar.  You'll see who'll get the wust of it in the long run.  I'd like\r\nprecious well to get damages--yea, swingin damages--out of one of you\r\nrevenoo fellers.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer looked around again.  It would not do to make a mistake.\r\nCaptain Corbet's words were not without effect.\r\n\r\n\"Yea!\" cried Captain Corbet.  \"Yea, naval sir!  I'm a free Nova Scotian\r\nas free as a bird.  I cruise about my natyve coasts whar I please.\r\nWho's to hender?  Seize me if you dar, an it'll be the dearest job you\r\never tried.  This here is my own private pleasure yacht.  These are my\r\nyoung friends, natyves, an amatoor fishermen. Cast your eye down into\r\nyonder hold, and see if this here's a fishin craft.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer looked down, and saw a cooking stove, trunks, and bedding.\r\nHe looked around in doubt.\r\n\r\nBut this scene had lasted long enough.\r\n\r\n\"O, nonsense!\" said Bart, suddenly pulling up his line, and coming\r\nforward; \"see here--it's all right,\" said he to the officer. \"We're not\r\nfishermen.  It's as he says.  We're only out on a short cruise, you\r\nknow, for pleasure, and that sort of thing.\"\r\n\r\nAs Bart turned, the others did the same.  Bruce lounged up, dragging\r\nhis line, followed by Arthur and the others.\r\n\r\n\"We're responsible for the schooner,\" said Bruce, quietly.  \"It's ours\r\nfor the time being.  We don't look like foreign fishermen--do we?\"\r\n\r\nThe officer looked at the boys, and saw his mistake at once.  He was\r\nafraid that he had made himself ridiculous.  The faces and manners of\r\nthe boys, as they stood confronting him in an easy and self-possessed\r\nmanner, showed most plainly the absurdity of his position.  Even the\r\nmysterious flag became intelligible, when he looked at the faces of\r\nthose over whom it floated.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it's all right,\" he muttered, in a vexed tone, and descended\r\ninto the boat without another word.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to have troubled you, captain,\" said Corbet, looking blandly\r\nafter the officer; \"but it wan't my fault.  I didn't have charge of\r\nthat thar injine.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer turned his back without a word, and the men pulled off to\r\nthe steamer.\r\n\r\nThe captain looked after the boat in silence for some time.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" said he, at length, as he heaved a gentle sigh,--\"I'm\r\nsorry that you put in your oars--I do SO like to sass a revonoo\r\nofficer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nSolomon surpasses himself.--A Period of Joy is generally followed by a\r\nTime of Sorrow.--Gloomy Forebodings.--The Legend of Petticoat\r\nJack.--Captain Corbet discourses of the Dangers of the Deep, and puts\r\nin Practice a new and original Mode of Navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis interruption put an end to their attempts at fishing, and was\r\nsucceeded by another interruption of a more pleasing character, in the\r\nshape of dinner, which was now loudly announced by Solomon. For some\r\ntime a savory steam had been issuing from the lower regions, and had\r\nbeen wafted to their nostrils in successive puffs, until at last their\r\nimpatient appetite had been roused to the keenest point, and the\r\nenticing fragrance had suggested all sorts of dishes.  When at length\r\nthe summons came, and they went below, they found the dinner in every\r\nway worthy of the occasion. Solomon's skill never was manifested more\r\nconspicuously than on this occasion; and whether the repast was judged\r\nof by the quantity or the quality of the dishes, it equally deserved to\r\nbe considered as one of the masterpieces of the distinguished artist\r\nwho had prepared it.\r\n\r\n\"Dar, chil'en,\" he exclaimed, as they took their places, \"dar, cap'en,\r\njes tas dem ar trout, to begin on, an see if you ever saw anythin to\r\nbeat 'em in all your born days.  Den try de stew, den de meat pie, den\r\nde calf's head; but dat ar pie down dar mustn't be touched, nor eben so\r\nmuch as looked at, till de las ob all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with these words Solomon stepped back, leaning both hands on his\r\nhips, and surveyed the banquet and the company with a smile of serene\r\nand ineffable complacency.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Solomon, my son,\" said Bart.  \"Your dinner is like\r\nyourself--unequalled and unapproachable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, bless you, my friend,\" murmured Bruce, in the intervals of\r\neating; \"if there is any contrast between this present voyage and\r\nformer ones, it is all due to our unequalled caterer.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you get the trout, Solomon?\" said Phil.\r\n\r\n\"De trout?  O, I picked 'em up last night down in de village,\" said\r\nSolomon.  \"Met little boy from Gaspereaux, an got 'em from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\" cried Tom, opening a dish--\"not lobster!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lobster!\" exclaimed Phil.\r\n\r\n\"So it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Solomon, where did you get lobster?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this the season for them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Think of the words of the poet, boys,\" said Bart, warningly,--\r\n\r\n          \"In the months without the R,\r\n           Clams and lobsters pison are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSolomon meanwhile stood apart, grinning from ear to ear, with his\r\nlittle black beads of eyes twinkling with merriment.\r\n\r\n\"Halo, Solomon!  What do you say to lobsters in July?\"\r\n\r\nSolomon's head wagged up and down, as though he were indulging in some\r\nquiet, unobtrusive laughter, and it was some time before he replied.\r\n\r\n\"O, neber you fear, chil'en,\" he said; \"ef you're only goin to get sick\r\nfrom lobsters, you'll live a long day.  You may go in for clams, an\r\nlobsters, an oysters any time ob de yeah you like,--ony dey mus be\r\ncooked up proper.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm gratified to hear that,\" said Bruce, gravely, \"but at the same\r\ntime puzzled.  For Mrs. Pratt says the exact opposite; and so here we\r\nhave two great authorities in direct opposition.  So what are we to\r\nthink?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, there's no difficulty,\" said Arthur, \"for the doctors are not of\r\nequal authority.  Mrs. Pratt is a quack, but Solomon is a\r\nprofessional--a regular, natural, artistic, and scientific cook, which\r\nat sea is the same as doctor.\"\r\n\r\nThe dinner was prolonged to an extent commensurate with its own\r\ninherent excellence and the capacity of the boys to appreciate it; but\r\nat length, like all things mortal, it came to a termination, and the\r\ncompany went up once more to the deck.  On looking round it was evident\r\nto all that a change had taken place.\r\n\r\nFour miles away lay Ile Haute, and eight or ten miles beyond this lay\r\nthe long line of Nova Scotia.  It was now about four o'clock, and the\r\ntide had been rising for three hours, and was flowing up rapidly, and\r\nin a full, strong current.  As yet there was no wind, and the broad\r\nsurface of the bay was quite smooth and unruffled. In the distance and\r\nfar down the bay, where its waters joined the horizon, there was a kind\r\nof haze, that rendered the line of separation between sea and sky very\r\nindistinct.  The coast of Nova Scotia was at once enlarged and\r\nobscured.  It seemed now elevated to an unusual height above the sea\r\nline, as though it had been suddenly brought several miles nearer, and\r\nyet, instead of being more distinct, was actually more obscure.  Even\r\nIle Haute, though so near, did not escape.  Four miles of distance were\r\nnot sufficient to give it that grand indistinctness which was now flung\r\nover the Nova Scotia coast; yet much of the mysterious effect of the\r\nhaze had gathered about the island; its lofty cliffs seemed to tower on\r\nhigh more majestically, and to lean over more frowningly; its fringe of\r\nblack sea-weed below seemed blacker, while the general hue of the\r\nisland had changed from a reddish color to one of a dull slaty blue.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like this,\" said Captain Corbet, looking down the bay and\r\ntwisting up his face as he looked.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad, bad, bad!\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Is there going to be a storm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wuss!\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse?  What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, hot an heavy, thick as puddin, an no mistake.  I tell you what it\r\nis, boys: judgin from what I see, they've got a bran-new steam injine\r\ninto that thar fog mill at Grand Manan; an the way they're goin to\r\ngrind out the fog this here night is a caution to mariners.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he took off his hat, and holding it in one hand, he\r\nscratched his venerable head long and thoughtfully with the other.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see any fog as yet,\" said Bart.\r\n\r\n\"Don't see it?  Wal, what d'ye call all that?\" said the captain, giving\r\na grand comprehensive sweep with his arm, so as to take in the entire\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's clear enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clear?  Then let me tell you that when you see a atmosphere like this\r\nhere, then you may expect to see it any moment changed into deep, thick\r\nfog.  Any moment--five minutes 'll be enough to snatch everything from\r\nsight, and bury us all in the middle of a unyversal fog bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"What'll we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dew?  That's jest the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we go on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal--without wind--I don't exactly see how.  In a fog a wind is not\r\nwithout its advantages.  That's one of the times when the old Antelope\r\nlikes to have her sails up; but as we hain't got no wind, I don't think\r\nwe'll do much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you stay here at anchor?\"\r\n\r\n\"At anchor?  Course not.  No, sir.  Moment the tide falls again, I'll\r\ndrift down so as to clear that pint there,--Cape Chignecto,--then\r\nanchor; then hold on till tide rises; and then drift up. Mebbe before\r\nthat the wind 'll spring up, an give us a lift somehow up the bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long before the tide will turn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, it'll be high tide at about a quarter to eight this evenin, I\r\ncalc'late.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll drift in the night, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I didn't know but what the fog and the night together might be too\r\nmuch for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too much?  Not a bit of it.  Fog, and night, and snow-storms, an tide\r\ndead agin me, an a lee shore, are circumstances that the Antelope has\r\nmet over an over, an fit down.  As to foggy nights, when it's as calm\r\nas this, why, they're not wuth considerin.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet's prognostication as to the fog proved to be correct.\r\nIt was only for a short time that they were allowed to stare at the\r\nmagnified proportions of the Nova Scotia coast and Ile Haute.  Then a\r\nchange took place which attracted all their attention.\r\n\r\nThe change was first perceptible down the bay.  It was first made\r\nmanifest by the rapid appearance of a thin gray cloud along the\r\nhorizon, which seemed to take in both sea and sky, and absorbed into\r\nitself the outlines of both.  At the same time, the coast of Nova\r\nScotia grew more obscure, though it lost none of its magnified\r\nproportions, while the slaty blue of Ile Haute changed to a grayer\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nThis change was rapid, and was followed by other changes.  The thin\r\ngray cloud, along the south-west horizon, down the bay, gradually\r\nenlarged itself; till it grew to larger and loftier proportions. In a\r\nquarter of an hour it had risen to the dimensions of the Nova Scotia\r\ncoast.  In a half an hour it was towering to double that height.  In an\r\nhour its lofty crest had ascended far up into the sky.\r\n\r\n\"It's a comin,\" said Captain Corbet.  \"I knowed it.  Grind away, you\r\nold fog mill!  Pile on the steam, you Grand Mananers!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any wind down there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a hooter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the fog coming up without any wind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Course it is.  What does the fog want of wind?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was the wind that brought it along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless your heart, the fog takes care of itself.  The wind isn't a bit\r\nnecessary.  It kine o' pervades the hull atmosphere, an rolls itself on\r\nan on till all creation is overspread.  Why, I've seen everything\r\nchanged from bright sunshine to the thickest kind of fog in fifteen\r\nminutes,--yea, more,--and in five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nEven while they were speaking the fog rolled on, the vast accumulation\r\nof mist rose higher and yet higher, and appeared to draw nearer with\r\nimmense rapidity.  It seemed as though the whole atmosphere was\r\ngradually becoming condensed, and precipitating its invisible watery\r\nvapor so as to make it visible in far-extending fog banks.  It was not\r\nwind, therefore, that brought on the clouds, for the surface of the\r\nwater was smooth and unruffled, but it was the character of the\r\natmosphere itself from which this change was wrought.  And still, as\r\nthey looked at the approaching mist, the sky overhead was blue, and the\r\nsun shone bright.  But the gathering clouds seemed now to have gained a\r\ngreater headway, and came on more rapidly.  In a few minutes the whole\r\noutline of the Nova Scotia coast faded from view, and in its place\r\nthere appeared a lofty wall of dim gray cloud, which rose high in the\r\nair, fading away into the faintest outline.  Overhead, the blue sky\r\nbecame rapidly more obscured; Ile Haute changed again from its grayish\r\nblue to a lighter shade, and then became blended with the impenetrable\r\nfog that was fast enclosing all things; and finally the clouds grew\r\nnearer, till the land nearest them was snatched from view, and all\r\naround was alike shrouded under the universal veil; nothing whatever\r\nwas visible.  For a hundred yards, or so, around them, they could see\r\nthe surface of the water; but beyond this narrow circle, nothing more\r\ncould be discerned.\r\n\r\n\"It's a very pooty fog,\" said Captain Corbet, \"an I only wonder that\r\nthere ain't any wind.  If it should come, it'll be all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You intend, then, to go on just the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jest the same as ef the sky was clear.  I will up anchor as the tide\r\nbegins to fall, an git a good piece down, so as to dodge Cape\r\nChegnecto, an there wait for the rising tide, an jest the same as ef\r\nthe sun was shinin.  But we can't start till eight o'clock this evenin.\r\nAnyhow, you needn't trouble yourselves a mite.  You may all go to\r\nsleep, an dream that the silver moon is guidin the traveller on the\r\nbriny deep.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene now was too monotonous to attract attention, and the boys\r\nonce more sought for some mode of passing the time.  Nothing appeared\r\nso enticing as their former occupation of fishing, and to this they\r\nagain turned their attention.  In this employment the time passed away\r\nrapidly until the summons was given for tea. Around the festive board,\r\nwhich was again prepared by Solomon with his usual success, they\r\nlingered long, and at length, when they arose, the tide was high.  It\r\nwas now about eight o'clock in the evening, and Captain Corbet was all\r\nready to start.  As the tide was now beginning to turn, and was on the\r\nebb, the anchor was raised, and the schooner, yielding to the pressure\r\nof the current, moved away from her anchorage ground.  It was still\r\nthick, and darkness also was coming on.  Not a thing could be\r\ndiscerned, and by looking at the water, which moved with the schooner,\r\nit did not seem as though any motion was made.\r\n\r\n\"That's all your blindness,\" said the captain, as they mentioned it to\r\nhim.  \"You can't see anything but the water, an as it is movin with us,\r\nit doesn't seem as though we were movin.  But we air, notwithstandin,\r\nan pooty quick too.  I'll take two hours' drift before stoppin, so as\r\nto make sure.  I calc'late about that time to get to a place whar I can\r\nhit the current that'll take me, with the risin tide, up to old\r\nPetticoat Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, captain,\" said Phil, \"what do you seafaring men believe\r\nabout the origin of that name--Petitcodiac?  Is it Indian or French?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't neither,\" said Captain Corbet, decidedly.  \"It's good English;\r\nit's 'Petticoat Jack;' an I've hearn tell a hundred times about its\r\noriginal deryvation.  You see, in the old French war, there was an\r\nEnglish spy among the French, that dressed hisself up as a woman, an\r\nwas familiarly known, among the British generals an others that emply'd\r\nhim, as 'Petticoat Jack.'  He did much to contriboot to the defeat of\r\nthe French; an arter they were licked, the first settlers that went up\r\nthar called the place, in honor of their benefacture, 'Petticoat Jack;'\r\nan it's bore that name ever sence.  An people that think it's French,\r\nor Injine, or Greek, or Hebrew, or any other outlandish tongue, don't\r\nknow what they're talkin about.  Now, I KNOW, an I assure you what I've\r\nben a sayin's the gospel terewth, for I had it of an old seafarin man\r\nthat's sailed this bay for more'n forty year, an if he ain't good\r\nauthority, then I'd like to know who is--that's all.\"\r\n\r\nAt this explanation of the etymology of the disputed term, the boys\r\nwere silent, and exchanged glances of admiration.\r\n\r\nIt was some minutes after eight when they left their anchorage, and\r\nbegan to drift once more.  There was no moon, and the night would have\r\nbeen dark in any case, but now the fog rendered all things still more\r\nobscure.  It had also grown much thicker than it had been.  At first it\r\nwas composed of light vapors, which surrounded them on all sides, it is\r\ntrue, but yet did not have that dampness which might have been\r\nexpected.  It was a light, dry fog, and for two or three hours the\r\ndeck, and rigging, and the clothes of those on board remained quite\r\ndry.  But now, as the darkness increased, the fog became denser, and\r\nwas more surcharged with heavy vapors. Soon the deck looked as though\r\nit had received a shower of rain, and the clothes of those on board\r\nbegan to be penetrated with the chill damp.\r\n\r\n\"It's very dark, captain,\" said Bruce, at last, as the boys stood near\r\nthe stern.\r\n\r\n\"Dradful dark,\" said the captain, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Have you really a good idea of where we are?\"\r\n\r\n\"An idee?  Why, if I had a chart,--which I haven't, cos I've got it all\r\nmapped out in my head,--but if I had one, I could take my finger an\r\npint the exact spot where we are a driftin this blessed minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going straight down the bay, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right--yea, I am; I'm goin straight down; but I hope an trust, an\r\nwhat's more, I believe, I am taking a kine o' cant over nigher the New\r\nBrunswick shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will we drift?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, for about two hours--darsn't drift longer; an besides, don't want\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Darsn't.  Thar's a place down thar that every vessel on this here bay\r\nsteers clear of, an every navigator feels dreadful shy of.\"\r\n\r\n\"What place is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quaco Ledge,\" said Captain Corbet, in a solemn tone.  \"We'll get as\r\nnear it as is safe this night, an p'aps a leetle nearer; but, then, the\r\nwater's so calm and still, that it won't make any difference--in fact,\r\nit wouldn't matter a great deal if we came up close to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quaco Ledge?\" said Bruce.  \"I've heard of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heard of it?  I should rayther hope you had.  Who hasn't?  It's the\r\none great, gen'ral, an standin terror of this dangerous and iron-bound\r\nbay.  There's no jokin, no nonsense about Quaco Ledge; mind I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does it lie?\" asked Phil, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, do you know whar Quaco settlement is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, Quaco Ledge is nigh about half way between Quaco settlement and\r\nIle Haute, bein a'most in the middle of the bay, an in a terrible\r\ndangerous place for coasters, especially in a fog, or in a snow-storm.\r\nMany's the vessel that's gone an never heard of, that Quaco Ledge could\r\ntell all about, if it could speak.  You take a good snowstorm in this\r\nBay of Fundy, an let a schooner get lost in it, an not know whar she\r\nis, an if Quaco Ledge don't bring her up all standin, then I'm a\r\nInjine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a large place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Considerably too large for comfort,\" said the captain.  \"They've\r\nsounded it, an found the whole shoal about three an a half mile long,\r\nan a half a mile broad.  It's all kivered over with water at high tide,\r\nbut at half tide it begins to show its nose, an at low tide you see as\r\npooty a shoal for shipwrecking as you may want; rayther low with\r\npleasant jagged rocks at the nothe-east side, an about a hundred yards\r\nor so in extent.  I've been nigh on to it in clear weather, but don't\r\nwant to be within five miles of it in a fog or in a storm.  In a thick\r\nnight like this, I'll pull up before I get close.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've never met with any accident there, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me?  No, not me.  I always calc'late to give Quaco Ledge the widest\r\nkine o' berth.  An I hope you'll never know anythin more about that\r\nsame place than what I'm tellin you now.  The knowlege which one has\r\nabout that place, an places ginrally of that kine, comes better by\r\nhearsay than from actool observation.\"\r\n\r\nTime passed on, and they still drifted, and at length ten o'clock came;\r\nbut before that time the boys had gone below, and retired for the\r\nnight.  Shortly after, the rattle of the chains waked them all, and\r\ninformed them that the Antelope had anchored once more.\r\n\r\nAfter this they all fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIn Clouds and Darkness.--A terrible Warning.--Nearly run down.--A\r\nlively Place.--Bart encounters an old Acquaintance.--Launched into the\r\nDeep.--Through the Country.--The Swift Tide.--The lost Boy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boys had not been asleep for more than two hours, when they were\r\nawakened by an uproar on deck, and rousing themselves from sleep, they\r\nheard the rattle of the chains and the crank of the windlass.  As their\r\nnight attire was singularly simple, and consisted largely of the dress\r\nwhich they wore by day, being the same, in fact, with the exception of\r\nthe hat, it was not long before they were up on deck, and making\r\ninquiries as to the unusual noise.  That the anchor was being hoisted\r\nthey already knew, but why it was they did not.\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" said Captain Corbet, \"thar's a good sou-wester started up, an as\r\nI had a few winks o' sleep, I jest thought I'd try to push on up the\r\nbay, an get as far as I could.  If I'd ben in any other place than\r\nthis, I wouldn't hev minded, but I'd hev taken my snooze out; but I'm\r\ntoo near Quaco Ledge by a good sight, an would rayther get further off.\r\nThe sou-wester'll take us up a considerable distance, an if it holds on\r\ntill arter the tide turns, I ask no more.\"\r\n\r\nSoon the anchor was up, and the Antelope spread her sails, and catching\r\nthe sou-wester, dashed through the water like a thing of life.\r\n\r\n\"We're going along at a great rate, captain,\" said Bart.\r\n\r\n\"Beggin your pardon, young sir, we're not doin much.  The tide here\r\nruns four knots agin us--dead, an the wind can't take us more'n six,\r\nwhich leaves a balance to our favor of two knots an hour, an that is\r\nour present rate of progression.  You see, at that rate we won't gain\r\nmore'n four or five miles before the turn o' tide. After that, we'll go\r\nfaster without any wind than we do now with a wind.  O, there's nothin\r\nlike navigatin the Bay o' Fundy to make a man feel contempt for the\r\nwind.  Give me tides an anchors, I say, an I'll push along.\"\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing fresh, and the sea was rising, yet the fog seemed\r\nthicker than ever.  The boys thought that the wind might blow the fog\r\naway, and hinted this to the captain.\r\n\r\nHis only response was a long and emphatic whistle.\r\n\r\n\"Whe-e-e-ew! what!  Blow the fog away?  This wind?  Why, this wind\r\nbrings the fog.  The sou-wester is the one wind that seafarin men dread\r\nin the Bay of Fundy.  About the wust kine of a storm is that thar very\r\nidentical wind blowin in these here very identical waters.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet's words were confirmed by the appearance of sea and sky.\r\nOutside was the very blackness of darkness.  Nothing whatever was\r\nvisible.  Sea and sky were alike hidden from view.  The waves were\r\nrising, and though they were not yet of any size, still they made noise\r\nenough to suggest the idea of a considerable storm, and the wind, as it\r\nwhistled through the rigging, carried in its sound a menace which would\r\nhave been altogether wanting in a bright night.  The boys all felt\r\nconvinced that a storm was rising, and looked forward to a dismal\r\nexperience of the pangs of seasickness. To fight this off now became\r\ntheir chief aim, and with this intention they all hurried below once\r\nmore to their beds.\r\n\r\nBut the water was not rough, the motion of the schooner was gentle, and\r\nthough there was much noise above, yet they did not notice any approach\r\nof the dreaded sea-sickness, and so in a short time they all fell\r\nasleep once more.\r\n\r\nBut they were destined to have further interruptions.  The interruption\r\ncame this time in a loud cry from Solomon, which waked them all at once.\r\n\r\n\"Get up, chil'en! get up!  It's all over!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, what!\" cried the boys; \"what's the matter?\" and springing up in\r\nthe first moment of alarm, they stood listening.\r\n\r\nAs they stood, there came to their ears the roaring of the wind through\r\nthe rigging, the flapping of the sails, the dashing and roaring of the\r\nwaters, in the midst of which there came also a shrill, penetrating\r\nsound, which seemed almost overhead--the sound of some steam whistle.\r\n\r\n\"Dar, dar!\" cried Solomon, in a tone of deadly fear.  \"It's a comin!  I\r\nknowed it.  We're all lost an gone.  It's a steamer. We're all run down\r\nan drownded.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word of response, the boys once more clambered on deck. All\r\nwas as dark as before, the fog as thick, the scene around as\r\nimpenetrable, the wind as strong.  From a distance there came over the\r\nwater, as they listened, the rapid beat of a steamboat's paddles, and\r\nsoon there arose again the long, shrill yell of the steam whistle.\r\nThey looked all around, but saw no sign of any steamer; nor could they\r\ntell exactly in which direction the sound arose.  One thought it came\r\nfrom one side, another thought it came from the opposite quarter, while\r\nthe others differed from these. As for Captain Corbet, he said nothing,\r\nwhile the boys were expressing their opinions loudly and confidently.\r\n\r\nAt last Bart appealed to Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the steamer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Down thar,\" said the captain, waving his hand over the stern.\r\n\r\n\"What steamer is it? the revenue steamer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not her.  That revenoo steamer is up to Windsor by this time. No; this\r\nis the St. John steamer coming up the bay, an I ony wish she'd take us\r\nan give us a tow up.\"\r\n\r\n\"She seems to be close by.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is close by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there some danger that we'll be run down?\"\r\n\r\nAs those words were spoken, another yell, louder, shriller, and nearer\r\nthan before, burst upon their ears.  It seemed to be close astern.  The\r\nbeat of the paddles was also near them.\r\n\r\n\"Pooty close!\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there some danger that we'll be run down?\"\r\n\r\nTo this question, thus anxiously repeated, the captain answered\r\nslowly,--\r\n\r\n\"Wal, thar may be, an then again thar mayn't.  Ef a man tries to dodge\r\nevery possible danger in life, he'll have a precious hard time of it.\r\nWhy, men air killed in walkin the streets, or knocked over by\r\nsun-strokes, as well as run down at sea.  So what air we to do?  Do?\r\nWhy, I jest do what I've allus ben a doin; I jest keep right straight\r\non my own course, and mind my own biz.  Ten chances to one they'll\r\nnever come nigh us.  I've heard steamers howlin round me like all\r\npossessed, but I've never ben run down yet, an I ain't goin to be at my\r\ntime o' life.  I don't blieve you'll see a sign o' that thar steamer.\r\nYou'll only hear her yellin--that's all.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke another yell sounded.\r\n\r\n\"She's a passin us, over thar,\" said the captain, waving his hand over\r\nthe side.  \"Her whistle'll contenoo fainter till it stops.  So you\r\nbetter go below and take your sleep out.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys waited a little longer, and hearing the next whistle sounding\r\nfainter, as Captain Corbet said, they followed his advice, and were\r\nsoon asleep, as before.\r\n\r\nThis time there was no further interruption, and they did not wake till\r\nabout eight in the morning, when they were summoned to breakfast by\r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the deck and looking around, a cry of joy went forth from\r\nall.  The fog was no longer to be seen, no longer did there extend\r\naround them the wall of gloomy gray, shutting out all things with its\r\nmisty folds.  No longer was the broad bay visible.  They found\r\nthemselves now in a wide river, whose muddy waters bore them slowly\r\nalong.  On one side was a shore, close by them, well wooded in some\r\nplaces, and in others well cultivated, while on the other side was\r\nanother shore, equally fertile, extending far along.\r\n\r\n\"Here we air,\" cried Captain Corbet.  \"That wind served us well. We've\r\nhad a fust-rate run.  I calc'lated we'd be three or four days, but\r\ninstead of that we've walked over in twenty-four hours. Good agin!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will we be able to land at Moncton soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, no; not till the next tide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, this tide won't last long enough to carry us up thar, an so we'll\r\nhave to wait here.  This is the best place thar is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What place is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hillsborough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hillsborough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  Do you see that thar pint?\" and Captain Corbet waved his arm\r\ntowards a high, well-wooded promontory that jutted out into the river.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I'm goin in behind that, and I'll wait thar till the tide turns.\r\nWe'll get up to Moncton some time before evenin.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the Antelope was heading towards the promontory; and\r\nsoon she passed it, and advanced towards the shore.  On passing the\r\npromontory a sight appeared which at once attracted the whole attention\r\nof the boys.\r\n\r\nImmediately in front of them, in the sheltered place which was formed\r\nby the promontory, was a little settlement, and on the bank of the\r\nriver was a ship-yard.  Here there arose the stately outline of a large\r\nship.  Her lower masts were in, she was decorated with flags and\r\nstreamers, and a large crowd was assembled in the yard around her.\r\n\r\n\"There's going to be a launch!\" cried Bart, to whom a scene like this\r\nwas familiar.\r\n\r\n\"A launch!\" cried Bruce.  \"Hurrah!  We'll be able to see it.  I've\r\nnever seen one in my life.  Now's the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we get ashore?\" said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Phil; \"and perhaps they'll let us go on board and be\r\nlaunched in her.\"\r\n\r\nThe very mention of such a thing increased the general excitement.\r\nCaptain Corbet was at once appealed to.\r\n\r\n\"O, thar's lots of time,\" said he.  \"Tain't quite high tide yet. You'll\r\nhave time to get ashore before she moves.  Hullo, Wade! Whar's that\r\noar?\"\r\n\r\nThe boys were all full of the wildest excitement, in the midst of which\r\nSolomon appeared with the announcement that breakfast was waiting.\r\n\r\nTo which Bart replied,--\r\n\r\n\"O, bother breakfast!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want any,\" said Bruce.\r\n\r\n\"I have no appetite,\" said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" said Pat.\r\n\r\n\"I want to be on board that ship,\" said Phil.\r\n\r\n\"We can easily eat breakfast afterwards,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\nAt this manifest neglect of his cooking, poor Solomon looked quite\r\nheart-broken; but Captain Corbet told him that he might bring the\r\nthings ashore, and this in some measure assuaged his grief.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to get ready.  The oar was flung on board the\r\nboat, which had thus far been floating behind the schooner; and though\r\nthe boat had a little too much water on board to be comfortable, yet no\r\ncomplaints were made, and in a few minutes they were landed.\r\n\r\n\"How much time have we yet?\" asked Bart, \"before high tide?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, you've got fifteen or twenty minutes,\" said Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah, boys!  Come along,\" said Bart; and leading the way, he went\r\nstraight to the office.\r\n\r\nAs he approached it he uttered suddenly a cry of joy.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Bart?\"\r\n\r\nBart said nothing, but hurried forward, and the astonished boys saw him\r\nshaking hands very vigorously with a gentleman who seemed like the\r\nchief man on the place.  He was an old acquaintance, evidently. In a\r\nfew minutes all was explained.  As the boys came up, Bart introduced\r\nthem as his friends, and they were all warmly greeted; after which the\r\ngentleman said,--\r\n\r\n\"Why, what a crowd of you there is!  Follow me, now.  There's plenty of\r\nroom for you, I imagine, in a ship of fifteen hundred tons; and you've\r\njust come in time.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he hurried off, followed by all the boys.  He led the\r\nway up an inclined plane which ran up to the bows of the ship, and on\r\nreaching this place they went along a staging, and finally, coming to a\r\nladder, they clambered up, and found themselves on the deck of the ship.\r\n\r\n\"I must leave you now, Bart, my boy,\" said the gentleman; \"you go to\r\nthe quarter-deck and take care of yourselves.  I must go down again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who in the world is he, Bart?\" asked the boys, as they all stood on\r\nthe quarter-deck.\r\n\r\n\"Was there ever such luck!\" cried Bart, joyously.  \"This is the ship\r\nSylph, and that is Mr. Watson, and he has built this ship for my\r\nfather.  Isn't it odd that we should come to this place at this\r\nparticular time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's as good as a play.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is.  I've known Mr. Watson all my life, and he's one of\r\nthe best men I ever met with.  He was as glad to see me as I was to see\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nBut now the boys stopped talking, for the scene around them began to\r\ngrow exciting.  In front of them was the settlement, and in the yard\r\nbelow was a crowd who had assembled to see the launch.  Behind them was\r\nthe broad expanse of the Petitcodiac River, beyond which lay the\r\nopposite shore, which went back till it terminated in wooded hills.\r\nOverhead arose the masts, adorned with a hundred flags and streamers.\r\nThe deck showed a steep slope from bow to stern.  But the scene around\r\nwas nothing, compared with the excitement of suspense, and expectation.\r\nIn a few minutes the hammers were to sound.  In a few minutes the\r\nmighty fabric on which they were standing would move, and take its\r\nplunge into the water.\r\n\r\nThe suspense made them hold their breath, and wait in perfect silence.\r\n\r\nAround them were a few men, who were talking in a commonplace way. They\r\nwere accustomed to launches, and an incident like this was as nothing\r\nin their lives, though to the boys it was sufficient to make their\r\nhearts throb violently, and deprive them of the power of speech.\r\n\r\nA few minutes passed.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to start soon,\" said Bart, in a whisper; for there was\r\nsomething in the scene which made them feel grave and solemn.\r\n\r\nThe other boys nodded in silence.\r\n\r\nA few minutes more passed.\r\n\r\nThen there arose a cry.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly there came to their excited ears the rattle of a\r\nhundred hammers.  Stroke after stroke, in quick succession, was dealt\r\nupon the wedges, which thus raised the vast structure from her\r\nresting-place.  For a moment she stood motionless, and then--\r\n\r\nThen with a slow motion, at first scarce perceptible, but which every\r\ninstant grew quicker, she moved down her ways, and plunged like\r\nlightning into the water.  The stern sank deep, then rose, and then the\r\nship darted through the water across the river.  Then suddenly the\r\nanchor was let go, and with the loud, sharp rattle of chains, rushed to\r\nthe bed of the river.  With a slight jerk the ship stopped.\r\n\r\nThe launch was over.\r\n\r\nA boat now came from the shore, bringing the builder, Mr. Watson; and\r\nat the same time a steamer appeared, rounding a point up the river, and\r\napproaching them.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to go to St. John, Bart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not just yet, sir,\" said Bart.\r\n\r\n\"Because if you do you can go down in the ship.  The steamer is going\r\nto take her in tow at once.  But if you don't want to go, you may go\r\nashore in the boat.  I'm sorry I can't stay here to show you the\r\ncountry, my boy; but I have to go down in the ship, and at once, for we\r\ncan't lie here in the river, unless we want to be left high and dry at\r\nlow tide.  So good by.  Go to the house.  Mrs. Watson'll make you\r\ncomfortable as long as you like; and if you want to take a drive you\r\nmay consider my horses your own.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he shook hands with all the boys for good by, and\r\nafter seeing them safely on board the boat, he waited for the steamer\r\nwhich was to tow the Sylph down the bay.  The boys then were rowed\r\nashore.  By the time they landed, the steamer had reached the ship, a\r\nstout cable was passed on board and secured, her anchor was weighed,\r\nand then, borne on by steam, and by the tide, too, which had already\r\nturned, the Sylph, in tow of the steamer, passed down the river, and\r\nwas soon out of sight.\r\n\r\nBart then went to see Mrs. Watson, with all the boys.  That lady, like\r\nher husband, was an old acquaintance, and in the true spirit of\r\nhospitality insisted on every one of them taking up their abode with\r\nher for an indefinite period.  Finding that they could not do this, she\r\nprepared for them a bounteous breakfast, and then persuaded them to go\r\noff for a drive through the country.  This invitation they eagerly\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nBefore starting, they encountered Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"Don't hurry back, boys,\" said he, \"unless you very pertik'l'ry wish to\r\ngo up to Moncton by the arternoon tide.  Don't mind me.  I got several\r\nthings to occoopy me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time could we start up river?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not before four.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, we'll be back by that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal.  Ony don't hurry back unless you like.  I got to buy some\r\nship-bread, an I got to fix some things about the boat.  It'll take\r\nsome time; so jest do as you like.\"\r\n\r\nBeing thus left to their own devices, and feeling quite unlimited with\r\nregard to time, the boys started off in two wagons, and took a long\r\ndrive through the country.  The time passed quickly, and they enjoyed\r\nthemselves so much that they did not get back until dusk.\r\n\r\n\"It's too late now, boys, to go up,\" said the captain, as he met them\r\non their return.  \"We've got to wait till next tide.  It's nearly high\r\ntide now.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, captain; it'll do just as well to go up river to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\nBut now Mrs. Watson insisted on their staying to tea, and so it\r\nhappened that it was after nine o'clock before they were ready to go on\r\nboard the Antelope.  Going down to the shore, they found the boat\r\nready, with some articles which Captain Corbet had procured.\r\n\r\n\"I've been fixing the gunwales,\" said he; \"an here's a box of\r\npilot-bread.  We were gettin out of provisions, an I've got in a\r\nsupply, an I've bought a bit of an old sail that'll do for a jib. I'm\r\nafeard thar won't be room for all of us.  Some of you better stay\r\nashore, an I'll come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll wait,\" said Bart, taking his seat on a stick of timber.\r\n\r\n\"An I'll wait, too,\" said Bruce.\r\n\r\nThe other boys objected in a friendly way, but Bart and Bruce insisted\r\non waiting, and so the boat at length started, leaving them behind.\r\n\r\nIn a short time it reached the schooner.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet secured the boat's painter to the stem, and threw the\r\noar on board.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys, one of you stay in the boat, an pass up them things to\r\nme--will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Tom.  \"I'll pass them up.\"\r\n\r\nOn this Captain Corbet got on board the schooner, followed by Arthur,\r\nand Phil, and Pat.  Tom waited in the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Captain Corbet, \"lift up that thar box of pilot-bread fust.\r\n'Tain't heavy.  We'll get these things out afore we go ashore for the\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\nHe stooped, and took the box of biscuit in his arms.\r\n\r\nAt that time the tide was running down very fast, and the boat, caught\r\nby the tide, was forced out from the schooner with such a pressure that\r\nthe rope was stiffened out straight.\r\n\r\nTom made one step forward.  The next instant he fell down in the bottom\r\nof the boat, and those on board of the schooner who were looking at him\r\nsaw, to their horror, that the boat was sweeping away with the tide,\r\nfar down the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nA Cry of Horror.--What shall we do?--Hard and fast.--Bart and\r\nBruce.--Gloomy Intelligence.--The Promontory.--The Bore of the\r\nPetitcodiac.--A Night of Misery.--A mournful Waking.--Taking Counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\nA cry of horror escaped those on board, and for some time they stood\r\nsilent in utter dismay.\r\n\r\n\"The rope wasn't tied,\" groaned Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was,\" said Captain Corbet; \"it bruk; catch me not tyin it. It\r\nbruk; see here!\" and he held up in the dim light the end of the rope\r\nwhich still was fastened to the schooner.  \"I didn't know it was\r\nrotten,\" he moaned; \"'tain't over ten year old, that bit o' rope, an\r\nI've had it an used it a thousand times without its ever thinkin o'\r\nbreakin.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do?\" cried Arthur.  \"We must do something to save him.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"We've got no boat,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Boat!  Who wants a boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do without a boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, up anchor, and go after him with the schooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"The schooner's hard and fast,\" said Captain Corbet, mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"Hard and fast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; don't you notice how she leans?  It's only a little, but that's a\r\nsign that her keel's in the mud.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it!  I won't believe it!\" cried Arthur.  \"Come, boys,\r\nup with the anchor.\"\r\n\r\nAs the boys rushed to the windlass, Captain Corbet went there, too,\r\nfollowed by the mate, and they worked at it for some time, until at\r\nlast the anchor rose to the surface.\r\n\r\nBut the Antelope did not move.  On the contrary, a still greater list\r\nto one side, which was now unmistakable, showed that the captain was\r\nright, and that she was actually, as he said, hard and fast.  This fact\r\nhad to be recognized, but Arthur would not be satisfied until he had\r\nactually seen the anchor, and then he knew that the vessel was really\r\naground.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say,\" he cried at last, \"that there is nothing to be\r\ndone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see,\" said Captain Corbet, \"what thar is to be done till the\r\nschewner muves.\"\r\n\r\n\"When will that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not till to-morrow mornin.\"\r\n\r\n\"How early?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not before eight o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight o'clock!\" cried Arthur, in horror.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, eight o'clock.  You see we had to come in pooty nigh to the\r\nshore, an it'll be eight o'clock before we're floated.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what'll become of poor Tom?\" groaned Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" said the captain, \"don't look on the wust.  He may get ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has no oar.  The oar was thrown aboard of the schooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still he may be carried ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any chance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, not much, to tell the truth.  Thar's no use of buo-oyin of\r\nourselves up with false hopes; not a mite.  Thar's a better chance of\r\nhis bein picked up.  That thar's likely now, an not unnatooral. Let's\r\nall don't give up.  If thar's no fog outside, I'd say his chances air\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it may be foggy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, in that case, he'll have to drift a while--sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there's no hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hope?  Who's a sayin thar's no hope?  Why, look here; he's got\r\nprovisions on board, an needn't starve; so if he does float for a day\r\nor two, whar's the harm?  He's sure to be picked up eventooally.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment their conversation was interrupted by a loud call from\r\nthe promontory.  It was the voice of Bruce.\r\n\r\nWhile these events had been taking place on board the schooner, Bruce\r\nand Bart had been ashore.  At first they had waited patiently for the\r\nreturn of the boat, but finally they wondered at her delay. They had\r\ncalled, but the schooner was too far off to hear them. Then they waited\r\nfor what seemed to them an unreasonably long time, wondering what kept\r\nthe boat, until at length Bruce determined to try and get nearer.  Burt\r\nwas to stay behind in case the boat should come ashore in his absence.\r\nWith this in view he had walked down the promontory until he had\r\nreached the extreme point, and there he found himself within easy hail\r\nof the Antelope.\r\n\r\n\"Schooner ahoy!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"A-ho-o-o-o-y!\" cried Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you come and take us off?\" he cried.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was silence for some time.  At last Captain Corbet\r\nshouted out,--\r\n\r\n\"The boat's lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"The boat's adrift.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet said nothing about Tom, from a desire to spare him for\r\nthe present.  So Bruce thought that the empty boat had drifted off, and\r\nas he had been prepared to hear of some accident, he was not much\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\nBut he was not to remain long in ignorance.  In a few moments he heard\r\nArthur's voice.\r\n\r\n\"Bruce!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\"\r\n\r\n\"The boat's gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\n\"TOM'S ADRIFT IN HER!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" shouted Bruce.\r\n\r\n\"TOM'S ADRIFT IN HER.\"\r\n\r\nAt this appalling intelligence Bruce's heart seemed to stop beating.\r\n\r\n\"How long?\" he dried, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Half an hour,\" cried Arthur.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go after him?\" cried Bruce again.\r\n\r\n\"We're aground,\" cried Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe whole situation was now explained, and Bruce was filled with his\r\nown share of that dismay which prevailed on board of the schooner; for\r\na long time nothing more was said.  At length Arthur's voice sounded\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Bruce!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get a boat, and come aboard as soon as you can after the tide turns.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.  How early will the tide suit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not before?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this nothing more was said.  Bruce could see for himself that the\r\ntide was falling, and that he would have to wait for the returning tide\r\nbefore a boat could be launched.  He waited for some time, full of\r\ndespair, and hesitating to return to Bart with his mournful\r\nintelligence.  At length he turned, and walked slowly back to his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Bruce?\" asked Bart, who by this time was sure that some accident\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n\"The boat's adrift.\"\r\n\r\n\"The boat!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and what's worse, poor Tom!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom!\" cried Bart, in a horror of apprehension.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Tom's adrift in her.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Bart said not a word, but stood for some time staring at Bruce\r\nin utter dismay.\r\n\r\nA few words served to explain to Bart the situation of the schooner,\r\nand the need of getting a boat.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Bart, \"we'd better see about it at once.  It's eleven\r\no'clock, but we'll find some people up; if not, we'll knock them up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with these words the two lads walked up from the river bank.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the houses attached to the shipyard, they found that most\r\nof the people were up.  There was a good deal of singing and laughter\r\ngoing on, which the boys interpreted to arise from a desire to\r\ncelebrate the launching of the ship.  They went first to Mrs. Watson's\r\nhouse, where they found that good lady up.  She listened to their story\r\nwith undisguised uneasiness, and afterwards called in a number of men,\r\nto whom she told the sad news.  These men listened to it with very\r\nserious faces.\r\n\r\n\"It's no joke,\" said one, shaking his head.  The others said nothing,\r\nbut their faces spoke volumes.\r\n\r\n\"What had we better do?\" asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n\"Of course ye'll be off as soon as ye can get off,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"The lad might have a chance,\" said another.  \"The return tide may\r\ndrift him back, but he may be carried too far down for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll be carried below Cape Chignecto unless he gets to the land,\"\r\nsaid another.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there a chance that he'll be picked up?\" asked Bart.\r\n\r\nThe man to whom he spoke shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"There's a deal of fog in the bay this night,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Fog?  Why, it's clear enough here.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is; but this place and the Bay of Fundy are two different\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"A regular sou-wester out there,\" said another man.\r\n\r\n\"An a pooty heavy sea by this time,\" said another.\r\n\r\nAnd in this way they all contributed to increase the anxiety of the two\r\nboys, until at last scarce a ray of hope was left.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better prepare yourselves for the worst,\" said one of the men.\r\n\"If he had an oar he would be all right; but, as it is--well, I don't\r\ncare about sayin what I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, you're all too despondent,\" said Mrs. Watson.  \"What is the use of\r\nlooking on the dark side?  Come, Bart, cheer up.  I'll look on the\r\nbright side.  Hope for the best.  Set out on the search with hope, and\r\na good heart.  I'm confident that he will be safe.  You will pick him\r\nup yourselves, or else you will hear of his escape somewhere.  I\r\nremember two men, a few years ago, that went adrift and were saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said one of the men, \"I mind that well.  They were Tom Furlong\r\nand Jim Spencer.  But that there boat was a good-sized fishing boat; an\r\nsuch a boat as that might ride out a gale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said Mrs. Watson.  \"You're all a set of confirmed croakers.\r\nWhy, Bart, you've read enough shipwreck books to know that little boats\r\nhave floated in safety for hundreds of miles.  So hope for the best;\r\ndon't be down-hearted.  I'll send two or three men down now to get the\r\nboat ready for you.  You can't do anything till the morning, you know.\r\nWon't you stay here?  You had better go to bed at once.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bart and Bruce could not think of bed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, come back any time, and a bed will be ready for you,\" said Mrs.\r\nWatson.  \"If you want to see about the boat now, the men are ready to\r\ngo with you.\"\r\n\r\nWith those words she led the way out to the kitchen, where a couple of\r\nmen were waiting.  Bart and Bruce followed them down to a boat-house on\r\nthe river bank, and saw the boat there which Mrs. Watson had offered\r\nthem.  This boat could be launched at any time, and as there was\r\nnothing more to be done, the boys strolled disconsolately about, and\r\nfinally went to the end of the promontory, and spent a long time\r\nlooking out over the water, and conversing sadly about poor Tom's\r\nchances.\r\n\r\nThere they sat late in the night, until midnight came, and so on into\r\nthe morning.  At last the scene before them changed from a sheet of\r\nwater to a broad expanse of mud.  The water had all retired, leaving\r\nthe bed of the river exposed.\r\n\r\nOf all the rivers that flow into the Bay of Fundy none is more\r\nremarkable than the Petitcodiac.  At high tide it is full--a mighty\r\nstream; at low tide it is empty--a channel of mud forty miles long; and\r\nthe intervening periods are marked by the furious flow of ascending or\r\ndescending waters.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the boys sat there looking out upon the expanse of mud\r\nbefore them, they became aware of a dull, low, booming sound, that came\r\nup from a far distant point, and seemed like the voice of many waters\r\nsounding from the storm-vexed bay outside.  There was no moon, but the\r\nlight was sufficient to enable them to see the exposed riverbed, far\r\nover to the shadowy outline of the opposite shore.  Here, where in the\r\nmorning a mighty ship had floated, nothing could now float; but the\r\nnoise that broke upon their ears told them of the return of the waters\r\nthat now were about to pour onward with resistless might into the empty\r\nchannel, and send successive waves far along into the heart of the land.\r\n\r\n\"What is that noise?\" asked Bruce.  \"It grows louder and louder.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said bart, \"is the Bore of the Petitcodiac.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever seen it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.  I've heard of it often, but have never seen it.\"\r\n\r\nBut their words were interrupted now by the deepening thunder of the\r\napproaching waters.  Towards the quarter whence the sound arose they\r\nturned their heads involuntarily.  At first they could see nothing\r\nthrough the gloom of night; but at length, as they strained their eyes\r\nlooking down the river, they saw in the distance a faint, white,\r\nphosphorescent gleam, and as it appeared the roar grew louder, and\r\nrounder, and more all-pervading.  On it came, carrying with it the\r\nhoarse cadence of some vast surf flung ashore from the workings of a\r\ndistant storm, or the thunder of some mighty cataract tumbling over a\r\nrocky precipice.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as they looked, the white, phosphorescent glow grew brighter,\r\nand then whiter, like snow; every minute it approached nearer, until at\r\nlast, full before them and beneath them, there rolled a giant wave,\r\nextending across the bed of the river, crescent-shaped, with its convex\r\nside advancing forwards, and its ends following after within short\r\ndistance from the shore.  The great wave rolled on, one mass of\r\nsnow-white foam, behind which gleamed a broad line of phosphorescent\r\nlustre from the agitated waters, which, in the gloom of night, had a\r\ncertain baleful radiance.  As it passed on its path, the roar came up\r\nmore majestically from the foremost wave; and behind that came the roar\r\nof other billows that followed in its wake.  By daylight the scene\r\nwould have been grand and impressive; but now, amid the gloom, the\r\ngrandeur became indescribable.  The force of those mighty waters seemed\r\nindeed resistless, and it was with a feeling of relief that the boys\r\nreflected that the schooner was out of the reach of its sweep.  Its\r\npassage was swift, and soon it had passed beyond them; and afar up the\r\nriver, long after it had passed from sight, they heard the distant\r\nthunder of its mighty march.\r\n\r\nBy the time the wave had passed, the boys found themselves excessively\r\nweary with their long wakefulness.\r\n\r\n\"Bart, my boy,\" said Bruce, \"we must get some rest, or we won't be\r\nworth anything to-morrow.  What do you say?  Shall we go back to Mrs.\r\nWatson's?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's too late--isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's pretty late, no doubt.  I dare say it's half past two; but\r\nthat's all the more reason why we should go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?  Do you think we had better disturb Mrs. Watson, or\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no; let's go into the barn, and lie down in the hay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.  Hay makes a capital bed.  For my part, I could sleep on\r\nstones.\"\r\n\r\n\"So could I.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm determined to hope for the best about Tom,\" said Bruce, rising and\r\nwalking off, followed by Bart.  \"Mrs. Watson was right. There's no use\r\nletting ourselves be downcast by a lot of croakers--is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Bart.\r\n\r\nThe boys then walked on, and in a few minutes reached the ship-yard.\r\n\r\nHere a man came up to them.\r\n\r\n\"We've been looking for you everywhere,\" said the man.  \"Mrs. Watson is\r\nanxious about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  She won't go to bed till you get back to the house.  There's\r\nanother man out for you, up the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I'm sorry we have given you all so much trouble,\" said Bart; \"but\r\nwe didn't think that anybody would bother themselves about us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you don't know Mrs. Watson that's all,\" said the man, walking\r\nalong with them.  \"She's been a worrytin herself to death about you;\r\nand the sooner she sees you, the better for her and for you.\"\r\n\r\nOn reaching the house the boys were received by Mrs. Watson.  One look\r\nat her was enough to show them that the man's account of her was true.\r\nHer face was pale, her manner was agitated, and her voice trembled as\r\nshe spoke to them, and asked them where they had been.\r\n\r\nBart expressed sorrow at having been the cause of so much trouble, and\r\nassured her he thought that she had gone to bed.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she; \"I've been too excited and agitated about your friend\r\nand about you.  But I'm glad that you've been found; and as it's too\r\nlate to talk now, you had better go to bed, and try to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words she gently urged them to their bedroom; and the boys,\r\nutterly worn out, did not attempt to withstand her.  They went to bed,\r\nand scarcely had their heads touched the pillows before they were fast\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the boys on board the Antelope had been no less anxious; and,\r\nunable to sleep, they had talked solemnly with each other over the\r\npossible fate of poor Tom.  Chafing from their forced inaction, they\r\nlooked impatiently upon the ebbing water, which was leaving them\r\naground, when they were longing to be floating on its bosom after their\r\nfriend, and could scarcely endure the thought of the suspense to which\r\nthey would be condemned while waiting for the following morning.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet also was no less anxious, though much less agitated. He\r\nacknowledged, with pain, that it was all his fault, but, appealed to\r\nall the boys, one by one, asking them how he should know that the rope\r\nwas rotten.  He informed them that the rope was an old favorite of his,\r\nand that he would have willingly risked his life on it.  He blamed\r\nhimself chiefly, however, for not staying in the boat himself, instead\r\nof leaving Tom in it.  To all his remarks the boys said but little, and\r\ncontented themselves with putting questions to him about the coast, the\r\ntides, the wind, the currents, and the fog.\r\n\r\nThe boys on board went to sleep about one o'clock, and waked at\r\nsunrise.  Then they watched the shore wistfully, and wondered why Bart\r\nand Bruce did not make their appearance.  But Bart and Bruce, worn out\r\nby their long watch, did not wake till nearly eight o'clock.  Then they\r\nhastily dressed themselves, and after a very hurried breakfast they\r\nbade good by to good Mrs. Watson.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be dreadfully anxious about that poor boy,\" said she, sadly.\r\n\"Promise me to telegraph as soon as you can about the result.\"\r\n\r\nBart promised.\r\n\r\nThen they hurried down to the beach.  The tide was yet a considerable\r\ndistance out; but a half dozen stout fellows, whose sympathies were\r\nfully enlisted in their favor, shoved the boat down over the mud, and\r\nlaunched her.\r\n\r\nThen Bart and Bruce took the oars, and soon reached the schooner, where\r\nthe boys awaited their arrival in mournful silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nTom adrift.--The receding Shores.--The Paddle.--The Roar of Surf--The\r\nFog Horn.--The Thunder of the unseen Breakers.--A Horror of great\r\nDarkness.--Adrift in Fog and Night.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the boat in which Tom was darted down the stream, he at first felt\r\nparalyzed by utter terror; but at length rousing himself, he looked\r\naround.  As the boat drifted on, his first impulse was to stop it; and\r\nin order to do this it was necessary to find an oar. The oar which\r\nCaptain Corbet had used to scull the boat to the schooner had been\r\nthrown on board of the latter, so that the contents of the boat might\r\nbe passed up the more conveniently.  Tom knew this, but he thought that\r\nthere might be another oar on board. A brief examination sufficed to\r\nshow him that there was nothing of the kind.  A few loose articles lay\r\nat the bottom; over these was the sail which Captain Corbet had bought\r\nin the ship-yard, and on this was the box of pilot-bread.  That was\r\nall.  There was not a sign of an oar, or a board, or anything of the\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he found out this than he tried to tear off one of the\r\nseats of the boat, in the hope of using this as a paddle.  But the\r\nseats were too firmly fixed to be loosened by his hands, and, after a\r\nfew frantic but ineffectual efforts, he gave up the attempt.\r\n\r\nBut he could not so quickly give up his efforts to save himself. There\r\nwas the box of biscuit yet.  Taking his knife from his pocket, he\r\nsucceeded in detaching the cover of the box, and then, using this as a\r\npaddle, he sought with frantic efforts to force the boat nearer to the\r\nshore.  But the tide was running very swiftly, and the cover was only a\r\nsmall bit of board, so that his efforts seemed to have but little\r\nresult.  He did indeed succeed in turning the boat's head around; but\r\nthis act, which was not accomplished without the severest labor, did\r\nnot seem to bring her nearer to the shore to any perceptible extent.\r\nWhat he sought to do was to achieve some definite motion to the boat,\r\nwhich might drag her out of the grasp of the swift current; but that\r\nwas the very thing which he could not do, for so strong was that grasp,\r\nand so swift was that current, that even an oar would have scarcely\r\naccomplished what he wished.  The bit of board, small, and thin, and\r\nfrail, and wielded with great difficulty and at a fearful disadvantage,\r\nwas almost useless.\r\n\r\nBut, though he saw that he was accomplishing little or nothing, he\r\ncould not bring himself to give up this work.  It seemed his only hope;\r\nand so he labored on, sometimes working with both hands at the board,\r\nsometimes plying his frail paddle with one hand, and using the other\r\nhand at a vain endeavor to paddle in the water.  In his desperation he\r\nkept on, and thought that if he gained ever so little, still, by\r\nkeeping hard at work, the little that he gained might finally tell upon\r\nthe direction of the boat--at any rate, so long as it might be in the\r\nriver.  He knew that the river ran for some miles yet, and that some\r\ntime still remained before he would reach the bay.\r\n\r\nThus Tom toiled on, half despairing, and nearly fainting with his\r\nfrenzied exertion, yet still refusing to give up, but plying his frail\r\npaddle until his nerveless arms seemed like weights of lead, and could\r\nscarce carry the board through the water.  But the result, which at the\r\noutset, and in the very freshness of his strength, had been but\r\ntrifling, grew less and less against the advance of his own weakness\r\nand the force of that tremendous tide, until at last his feeble\r\nexertions ceased to have any appreciable effect whatever.\r\n\r\nThere was no moon, but it was light enough for him to see the\r\nshores--to see that he was in the very centre of that rapid current,\r\nand to perceive that he was being borne past those dim shores with\r\nfearful velocity.  The sight filled him with despair, but his arms\r\ngained a fresh energy, from time to time, out of the very desperation\r\nof his soul.  He was one of those natures which are too obstinate to\r\ngive up even in the presence of despair itself; and which, even when\r\nhope is dead, still forces hope to linger, and struggles on while a\r\nparticle of life or of strength remains.  So, as he toiled on, and\r\nfought on, against this fate which had suddenly fixed itself upon him,\r\nhe saw the shores on either side recede, and knew that every passing\r\nmoment was bearing him on to a wide, a cruel, and a perilous sea.  He\r\ntook one hasty glance behind him, and saw what he knew to be the mouth\r\nof the river close at hand; and beyond this a waste of waters was\r\nhidden in the gloom of night.  The sight lent new energy to his\r\nfainting limbs.  He called aloud for help.  Shriek after shriek burst\r\nfrom him, and rang wildly, piercingly, thrillingly upon the air of\r\nnight.  But those despairing shrieks came to no human ear, and met with\r\nno response.  They died away upon the wind and the waters; and the\r\nfierce tide, with swifter flow, bore him onward.\r\n\r\nThe last headland swept past him; the river and the river bank were now\r\nlost to him.  Around him the expanse of water grew darker, and broader,\r\nand more terrible.  Above him the stars glimmered more faintly from the\r\nsky.  But the very habit of exertion still remained, and his faint\r\nplunges still dipped the little board into the water; and a vague idea\r\nof saving himself was still uppermost in his mind.  Deep down in that\r\nstout heart of his was a desperate resolution never to give up while\r\nstrength lasted; and well he sustained that determination.  Over him\r\nthe mist came floating, borne along by the wind which sighed around\r\nhim; and that mist gradually overspread the scene upon which his\r\nstraining eyes were fastened.  It shut out the overhanging sky.  It\r\nextinguished the glimmering stars.  It threw a veil over the receding\r\nshores.  It drew its folds around him closer and closer, until at last\r\neverything was hidden from view.  Closer and still closer came the\r\nmist, and thicker and ever thicker grew its dense folds, until at last\r\neven the water, into which he still thrust his frail paddle, was\r\ninvisible.  At length his strength failed utterly.  His hands refused\r\nany longer to perform their duty.  The strong, indomitable will\r\nremained, but the power of performing the dictates of that will was\r\ngone.  He fell back upon the sail that lay in the bottom of the boat,\r\nand the board fell from his hands.\r\n\r\nAnd now there gathered around the prostrate figure of the lost boy all\r\nthe terrors of thickest darkness.  The fog came, together with the\r\nnight, shrouding all things from view, and he was floating over a wide\r\nsea, with an impenetrable wall of thickest darkness closing him in on\r\nall sides.\r\n\r\nAs he thus lay there helpless, he had leisure to reflect for the first\r\ntime upon the full bitterness of his situation.  Adrift in the fog, and\r\nin the night, and borne onward swiftly down into the Bay of Fundy--that\r\nwas his position.  And what could he do?  That was the one question\r\nwhich he could not answer.  Giving way now to the rush of despair, he\r\nlay for some time motionless, feeling the rocking of the waves, and the\r\nbreath of the wind, and the chill damp of the fog, yet unable to do\r\nanything against these enemies. For nearly an hour he lay thus\r\ninactive, and at the end of that time his lost energies began to\r\nreturn.  He rose and looked around. The scene had not changed at all;\r\nin fact, there was no scene to change.  There was nothing but black\r\ndarkness all around.  Suddenly something knocked against the boat.  He\r\nreached out his hand, and touched a piece of wood, which the next\r\ninstant slipped from his grasp.  But the disappointment was not without\r\nits alleviation, for he thought that he might come across some bits of\r\ndrift wood, with which he could do something, perhaps, for his escape.\r\nAnd so buoyant was his soul, and so obstinate his courage, that this\r\nlittle incident of itself served to revive his faculties.  He went to\r\nthe stern of the boat, and sitting there, he tried to think upon what\r\nmight be best to be done.\r\n\r\nWhat could be done in such a situation?  He could swim, but of what\r\navail was that?  In what direction could he swim, or what progress\r\ncould he make, with such a tide?  As to paddling, he thought of that no\r\nmore; paddling was exhausted, and his board was useless. Nothing\r\nremained, apparently, but inaction.  Inaction was indeed hard, and it\r\nwas the worst condition in which he could be placed, for in such a\r\nstate the mind always preys upon itself; in such a state trouble is\r\nalways magnified, and the slow time passes more slowly.  Yet to this\r\ninaction he found himself doomed.\r\n\r\nHe floated on now for hours, motionless and filled with despair,\r\nlistening to the dash of the waves, which were the only sounds that\r\ncame to his ears.  And so it came to pass, in process of time, that by\r\nincessant attention to these monotonous sounds, they ceased to be\r\naltogether monotonous, but seemed to assume various cadences and\r\nintonations.  His sharpened ears learned at last to distinguish between\r\nthe dash of large waves and the plash of small ones, the sighing of the\r\nwind, the pressure of the waters against the boat's bows, and the\r\nripple of eddies under its stern.  Worn out by excitement and fatigue,\r\nhe lay motionless, listening to sounds like these, and taking in them a\r\nmournful interest, when suddenly, in the midst of them, his ears caught\r\na different cadence.  It was a long, measured sound, not an unfamiliar\r\none, but one which he had often heard--the gathering sound which breaks\r\nout, rising and accumulating upon the ear, as the long line of surf\r\nfalls upon some rocky shore.  He knew at once what this was, and\r\nunderstood by it that he was near some shore; but what shore it might\r\nbe he could not know.  The sound came up from his right, and therefore\r\nmight be the New Brunswick coast, if the boat had preserved its proper\r\nposition.  But the position of the boat had been constantly changing as\r\nshe drifted along, so that it was impossible to tell whether he was\r\ndrifting stern foremost or bow foremost.  The water moved as the boat\r\nmoved, and there was no means by which to judge. He listened to the\r\nsurf, therefore, but made no attempt to draw nearer to it.  He now knew\r\nperfectly well that with his present resources no efforts of his could\r\navail anything, and that his only course would be to wait.  Besides,\r\nthis shore, whatever it was, must be very different, he thought, from\r\nthe banks of the Petitcodiac.  It was, as he thought, an iron-bound\r\nshore.  And the surf which he heard broke in thunder a mile away, at\r\nthe foot of giant precipices, which could only offer death to the\r\nhapless wretch who might be thrown among them.  He lay, therefore,\r\ninactive, listening to this rolling surf for hours.  At first it grew\r\ngradually louder, as though he was approaching it; but afterwards it\r\ngrew fainter quite as gradually, until at length it could no longer be\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nDuring all these lonely hours, one thing afforded a certain\r\nconsolation, and that was, the discovery that the sea did not grow\r\nrougher.  The wind that blew was the sou-wester, the dreaded wind of\r\nfog and, storm; but on this occasion its strength was not put forth; it\r\nblew but moderately, and the water was not very greatly disturbed.  The\r\nsea tossed the little boat, but was not high enough to dash over her,\r\nor to endanger her in any way.  None of its spray ever came upon the\r\nrecumbent form in the boat, nor did any moisture come near him, save\r\nthat which was deposited by the fog.  At first, in his terror, he had\r\ncounted upon meeting a tempestuous sea; but, as the hours passed, he\r\nsaw that thus far there had been nothing of the kind, and, if he were\r\ndestined to be exposed to such a danger, it lay as yet in the future.\r\nAs long as the wind continued moderate, so long would he toss over the\r\nlittle waves without being endangered in any way.  And thus, with all\r\nthese thoughts, sometimes depressing, at other times rather\r\nencouraging, he drifted on.\r\n\r\nHours passed away.\r\n\r\nAt length his fatigue overpowered him more and more, and as he sat\r\nthere in the stern, his eyes closed, and his head fell heavily forward.\r\nHe laid it upon the sail which was in front of him, so as to get an\r\neasier position, and was just closing his eyes again, when a sound came\r\nto his ears which in an instant drove every thought of sleep and of\r\nfatigue away, and made him start up and listen with intense eagerness.\r\n\r\nIt was the sound of a fog horn, such as is used by coasting vessels,\r\nand blown during a fog, at intervals, to give warning of their\r\npresence.  The sound was a familiar one to a boy who had been brought\r\nup on the fog-encircled and fish-haunted shores of Newfoundland; and\r\nTom's hearing, which had been almost hushed in slumber, caught it at\r\nonce.  It was like the voice of a friend calling to him.  But for a\r\nmoment he thought it was only a fancy, or a dream, and he sat listening\r\nand quivering with excitement.  He waited and listened for some time,\r\nand was just about to conclude that it was a dream, when suddenly it\r\ncame again.  There was no mistake this time.  It was a fog horn.  Some\r\nschooner was sailing these waters.  O for day-light, and O for clear\r\nweather, so that he might see it, and make himself seen!  The sound,\r\nthough clear, was faint, and the schooner was evidently at a\r\nconsiderable distance; but Tom, in his eagerness, did not think of\r\nthat.  He shouted with all his strength.  He waited for an answer, and\r\nthen shouted again. Once more he waited, and listened, and then again\r\nand again his screams went forth over the water.  But still no response\r\ncame.  At last, after some interval, the fog horn again sounded.  Again\r\nTom screamed, and yelled, and uttered every sound that could possibly\r\nconvey to human ears an idea of his presence, and of his distress.\r\n\r\nThe sounds of the fog horn, however, did not correspond with his cries.\r\nIt was blown at regular intervals, which seemed painfully long to Tom,\r\nand did not seem to sound as if in answer to him.  At first his hope\r\nwas sustained by the discovery that the sounds were louder, and\r\ntherefore nearer; but scarcely had he assured himself of this, when he\r\nperceived that they were growing fainter again, as though the schooner\r\nhad approached him, and then sailed away.  This discovery only\r\nstimulated him to more frantic exertions.  He yelled more and more\r\nloudly, and was compelled, at last, to cease from pure exhaustion.  But\r\neven then he did not cease till long after the last notes of the\r\ndeparting fog horn had faintly sounded in his ears.\r\n\r\nIt was a disappointment bitter indeed, since it came after a reviving\r\nhope.  What made it all the worse was a fixed idea which he had, that\r\nthe schooner was no other than the Antelope.  He felt confident that\r\nshe had come at once after him, and was now traversing the waters in\r\nsearch of him, and sounding the horn so as to send it to his ears and\r\nget his response.  And his response had been given with this result!\r\nThis was the end of his hopes.  He could bear it no longer.  The stout\r\nheart and the resolute obstinacy which had so long struggled against\r\nfate now gave way utterly.  He buried his face in his hands, and burst\r\ninto a passion of tears.\r\n\r\nHe wept for a long time, and roused himself, at last, with difficulty,\r\nto a dull despair.  What was the use of hoping, or thinking, or\r\nlistening?  Hope was useless.  It was better to let himself go wherever\r\nthe waters might take him.  He reached out his hand and drew the sail\r\nforward, and then settling himself down in the stern of the boat, he\r\nagain shut his eyes and tried to sleep. But sleep, which a short time\r\nbefore had been so easy, was now difficult.  His ears took in once more\r\nthe different sounds of the sea, and soon became aware of a deeper,\r\ndrearer sound than any which had hitherto come to him.  It was the\r\nhoarse roar of a great surf, far more formidable than the one which he\r\nhad heard before. The tumult and the din grew rapidly louder, and at\r\nlength became so terrific that he sat upright, and strained his eyes in\r\nthe direction from which it came.  Peering thus through the darkness,\r\nhe saw the glow of phosphorescent waves wrought out of the strife of\r\nmany waters; and they threw towards him, amid the darkness, a baleful\r\ngleam which fascinated his eyes.  A feeling came to him now that all\r\nwas over.  He felt, as though he were being sucked into some vortex,\r\nwhere Death lay in wait for him.  He trembled.  A prayer started to his\r\nlips, and burst from him.  Suddenly his boat seemed caught by some\r\nresistless force, and jerked to one side; the next instant it rose on\r\nsome swelling wave, and was shot swiftly forward.  Tom closed his eyes,\r\nand a thrill of horror passed through every nerve.  All at once a rude\r\nshock was felt, and the boat shook, and Tom thought he was going down.\r\nIt seemed like the blow of a rock, and he could think only of the\r\ningulfing waters. But the waters hesitated to claim their prey; the\r\nrushing motion ceased; and soon the boat was tossing lightly, as\r\nbefore, over the waves, while the hoarse and thunderous roar of those\r\ndread unseen breakers, from which he had been so wondrously saved,\r\narose wrathfully behind, as though they were howling after their\r\nescaped victim.  A cry of gratitude escaped Tom, and with trembling\r\nlips he offered a heart-felt prayer to that divine Power whose mighty\r\nhand had just rescued him from a terrible doom.\r\n\r\nTom's agitation had been so great that it was long before he could\r\nregain his former calm.  At last, however, his trembling subsided. He\r\nheard no longer the howling surf.  All was calm and quiet.  The wind\r\nceased, the boat's motion was less violent, the long-resisted slumber\r\ncame once more to his eyes.  Still his terror kept off sleep, and as\r\nhis eyes would close, they would every moment open again, and he would\r\nstart in terror and look around.\r\n\r\nAt length he saw that the darkness was less profound.  Light was\r\ncoming, and that light was increasing.  He could see the dark waters,\r\nand the gloomy folds of the enclosing mist became apparent. He gave a\r\nheavy sigh, partly of terror at the thought of all that he had gone\r\nthrough, and partly of relief at the approach of light.\r\n\r\nWell might he sigh, for this light was the dawn of a new day, and\r\nshowed him that he had been a whole night upon the waters.\r\n\r\nAnd now he could no longer struggle against sleep.  His eyes closed for\r\nthe last time.  His head fell forward on the wet sail.\r\n\r\nHe was sound asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nLost in the Fog.--The Shoal and its Rocks.--Is it a Reef?--The\r\nTruth.--Hoisting Sail.--A forlorn Hope.--Wild Steering.--Where am\r\nI?--Land, ho!\r\n\r\n\r\nTom slept for many hours; and when he at length awoke, he was stiffened\r\nin every limb, and wet to the skin.  It was his constrained position\r\nand the heavy fog which had done this.  He sat up and looked around\r\nwith a bewildered air; but it did not take a long time for him to\r\ncollect his wandering faculties, and arrive at the full recollection of\r\nhis situation.  Gradually it all came before him--the night of horror,\r\nthe long drift, the frantic struggles, the boom of the surf, the\r\nshrill, penetrating tone of the fog horn, his own wild screams for\r\nhelp, the thunder of the breakers, and the grasp of the giant wave; all\r\nthese, and many more, came back to his mind; and he was all too soon\r\nenabled to connect his present situation with the desperate position of\r\nthe preceding night.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these gloomy thoughts, which thus rushed in one\r\naccumulated mass over his soul, his first impulse had nothing to do\r\nwith these things, but was concerned with something very different from\r\nuseless retrospect, and something far more essential.  He found himself\r\nravenously hungry; and his one idea was to satisfy the cravings of his\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nHe thought at once of the box of biscuit.\r\n\r\nThe sail which he had pulled forward had very fortunately covered it\r\nup, else the contents might have been somewhat damaged.  As it was, the\r\nupper edges of the biscuits, which had been exposed before being\r\ncovered by the sail, were somewhat damp and soft, but otherwise they\r\nwere not harmed; and Tom ate his frugal repast with extreme relish.\r\nSatisfying his appetite had the natural effect of cheering his spirits,\r\nand led him to reflect with thankfulness on the very fortunate presence\r\nof that box of biscuit in the boat. Had it not been for that, how\r\nterrible would his situation be!  But with that he could afford to\r\nentertain hope, and might reasonably expect to endure the hardships of\r\nhis situation.  Strange to say, he was not at all thirsty; which\r\nprobably arose from the fact that he was wet to the skin.\r\n\r\nImmersing one's self in water is often resorted to by shipwrecked\r\nmariners, when they cannot get a drink, and with successful results.\r\nAs for Tom, his whole night had been one long bath, in which he had\r\nbeen exposed to the penetrating effects of the sea air and the fog.\r\n\r\nHe had no idea whatever of the time.  The sun could not be seen, and so\r\nthick was the fog that he could not even make out in what part of the\r\nsky it might be.  He had a general impression, however, that it was\r\nmidday; and this impression was not very much out of the way.  His\r\nbreakfast refreshed him, and he learned now to attach so much value to\r\nhis box of biscuit, that his chief desire was to save it from further\r\ninjury.  So he hunted about for the cover, and finding it underneath\r\nthe other end of the sail, he put it on the box, and then covered it\r\nall up.  In this position the precious contents of the box were safe.\r\n\r\nThe hour of the day was a subject of uncertainty, and so was the state\r\nof the tide.  Whether he was drifting up or down the bay he could not\r\ntell for certain.  His recollection of the state of the tide at\r\nPetitcodiac, was but vague.  He reckoned, however, from the ship launch\r\nof the preceding day, and then, allowing sufficient time for the\r\ndifference in the tide, he approximated to a correct conclusion.  If it\r\nwere midday, he thought that the tide would be about half way down on\r\nthe ebb.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts, and acts, and calculations took up some time, and he\r\nnow began to look around him.  Suddenly his eye caught sight of\r\nsomething not far away, dimly visible through the mist.  It looked like\r\na rock.  A farther examination showed him that such was the case.  It\r\nwas a rock, and he was drifting towards it.  No sooner had he\r\nascertained this, than all his excitement once more awakened.\r\nTrembling from head to foot at this sudden prospect of escape, he\r\nstarted to his feet, and watched most eagerly the progress of the boat.\r\nIt was drifting nearer to the rock.  Soon another appeared, and then\r\nanother.  The rocks were black, and covered with masses of sea-weed, as\r\nthough they were submerged at high tide.  A little nearer, and he saw a\r\ngravelly strand lying just beyond the rocks.  His excitement grew\r\nstronger and stronger, until at last it was quite uncontrollable.  He\r\nbegan to fear that he would drift past this place, into the deep water\r\nagain.  He sprang into the bows, and grasping the rope in his hand,\r\nstood ready to leap ashore.  He saw that he was drawing nearer, and so\r\ndelayed for a while.  Nearer he came and nearer.  At length the boat\r\nseemed to pass along by the gravelly beach, and move by it as though it\r\nwould go no nearer.  This Tom could not endure.  He determined to wait\r\nno longer.  He sprang.\r\n\r\nHe sank into the water up to his armpits, but he did not lose his hold\r\nof the rope.  Clutching this in a convulsive grasp, he regained his\r\nfoothold, which he had almost lost, and struggled forward.  For a few\r\nmoments he made no headway, for the boat, at the pressure of the\r\ncurrent, pulled so hard that he could not drag it nearer.  A terrible\r\nfear came to him that the rope might break. Fortunately it did not,\r\nand, after a short but violent struggle, Tom conquered the resistance\r\nof the tide, and pulled the boat slowly towards the shore.  He then\r\ntowed it near to the rocks, dragged its bows up as far as he could, and\r\nfastened it securely.\r\n\r\nThen he looked around.\r\n\r\nA few rocks were near him, about six feet high, jutting out of the\r\ngravel; and beyond these were others, which rose out of the water. Most\r\nof them were covered with sea-weed.  A few sticks of timber were wedged\r\nin the interstices of the nearest rocks.  As to the rest, he saw only a\r\nrocky ledge of small extent, which was surrounded by water.  Beyond\r\nthis nothing was visible but fog.\r\n\r\nAt first he had thought that this was a beach, but now he began to\r\ndoubt this.  He walked all around, and went into the water on every\r\nside, but found no signs of any neighboring shore.  The place seemed\r\nrather like some isolated ledge.  But where was it, and how far away\r\nwas the shore?  If he could only tell that!  He stopped, and listened\r\nintently; he walked all around, and listened more intently still, in\r\nhopes of hearing the sound of some neighboring surf.  In vain.  Nothing\r\nof the kind came to his ears.  All was still.  The water was not rough,\r\nnor was there very much wind. There was only a brisk breeze, which\r\nthrew up light waves on the surface.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he noticed that the tide was going down, and the area of\r\nthe ledge was evidently enlarging.  This inspired hope, for he thought\r\nthat perhaps some long shoal might be disclosed by the retreating tide,\r\nwhich might communicate with the main land.  For this he now watched\r\nintently, and occupied himself with measuring the distance from the\r\nrock where his boat was tied.  Doing this from time to time, he found\r\nthat every little while the number of paces between the rock and the\r\nwater's edge increased.  This occupation made the time pass rapidly;\r\nand at last Tom found his stopping-place extending over an area of\r\nabout a hundred yards in length, and half as many in breadth.  The\r\nrocks at one end had increased in apparent size, and in number; but the\r\nledge itself remained unchanged in its general character.\r\n\r\nThis, he saw, was its extreme limit, beyond which it did not extend.\r\nThere was no communication with any shore.  There was no more\r\nindication now of land than when he had first arrived.  This discovery\r\nwas a gradual one.  It had been heralded by many fears and suspicions,\r\nso that at last, when it forced itself on his convictions, he was not\r\naltogether unprepared.  Still, the shock was terrible, and once more\r\npoor Tom had to struggle with his despair--a despair, too, that was all\r\nthe more profound from the hopes that he had been entertaining.  He\r\nfound, at length, in addition to this, that the tide was rising, that\r\nit was advancing towards his resting-place, and that it would, no\r\ndoubt, overflow it all before long.  It had been half tide when he\r\nlanded, and but a little was uncovered; at full tide he saw that it\r\nwould all be covered up by the water,--sea weed, rocks, and all,--and\r\nconcealed from human eye.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these painful discoveries there suddenly occurred to\r\nhim the true name and nature of this place.\r\n\r\nQuaco Ledge!\r\n\r\nThat was the place which Captain Corbet had described.  He recalled now\r\nthe full description.  Here it lay before him; upon it he stood; and he\r\nfound that it corresponded in every respect with the description that\r\nthe captain had given.  If this were indeed so, and the description\r\nwere true,--and he could not doubt this,--how desperate his situation\r\nwas, and how he had been deceived in his false hopes!  Far, far away\r\nwas he from any shore!--in the middle of the bay; on a place avoided by\r\nall--a place which he should shun above all other places if he hoped\r\nfor final escape!\r\n\r\nAnd now he was as eager to quit this ill-omened place as he had once\r\nbeen to reach it.  The tide was yet low.  He tried to push the boat\r\ndown, but could not.  He saw that he would have to wait.  So he got\r\ninside the boat, and, sitting down, he waited patiently. The time\r\npassed slowly, and Tom looked despairingly out over the water.\r\nSomething attracted his attention.  It was a long pole, which had\r\nstruck against the edge of the shoal.  He got out of the boat, and,\r\nsecuring it, he walked back again.  It was some waif that had been\r\ndrifting about till it was thus cast at his feet.  He thought of taking\r\nit for a mast, and making use of the sail.  The idea was an attractive\r\none.  He pulled the sail out, unfolded it, and found it to be the jib\r\nof some schooner.  He cut off one end of this, and then with his knife\r\nbegan to make a hole in the seat for his mast.  It was very slow work,\r\nbut he succeeded at last in doing it, and inserted the pole.  Then he\r\nfastened the sail to it.  He was rather ignorant of navigation, but he\r\nhad a general idea of the science, and thought he would learn by\r\nexperience.  By cutting off the rope from the edge of the sail he\r\nobtained a sheet, and taking off the cover of the biscuit box a second\r\ntime, he put this aside to use as a rudder.\r\n\r\nBut now, in what direction ought he to steer?\r\n\r\nThis was an insoluble problem.  He could tell now by the flow of the\r\ncurrent the points of the compass, but could not tell in which\r\ndirection he ought to go.  The New Brunswick coast he thought was\r\nnearest, but he dreaded it.  It seemed perilous and unapproachable. He\r\ndid not think much better of the Nova Scotia coast.  He thought rather\r\nof Cape d'Or, as a promising place of refuge, or the Petitcodiac.  So,\r\nafter long deliberation, he decided on steering back again, especially\r\nas the wind was blowing directly up the bay.\r\n\r\nBy the time that he had finished these preparations and deliberations\r\nthe boat was afloat.  Eagerly Tom pushed it away from the shoal;\r\neagerly, and with trembling hands, he let the sail unfold, and thrust\r\nthe board into the water astern.  The boat followed the impulse of the\r\nwind, and the young sailor saw with delight that his experiment was\r\nsuccessful, and before long the dark rocks of Quaco Ledge were lost to\r\nview.\r\n\r\nNow, where there is a definite object to steer by, or a compass to\r\nguide one, and a decent rudder, even an inexperienced hand can manage\r\nto come somewhere near the point that he aims at.  But take a boat like\r\nTom's, and a rude and suddenly extemporized sail, with no other rudder\r\nthan a bit of board, with no compass, and a surrounding of thick fog,\r\nand it would puzzle even an experienced sailor to guide himself aright.\r\nTom soon suspected that his course was rather a wild one; his board in\r\nparticular became quite unmanageable, and he was fatigued with trying\r\nto hold it in the water.  So he threw it aside, and boldly trusted to\r\nhis sail alone.\r\n\r\nThe boat seemed to him to be making very respectable progress.  The\r\nwind was fresh, and the sea only moderate.  The little waves beat over\r\nthe bows, and there was quite a commotion astern.  Tom thought he was\r\ndoing very well, and heading as near as possible towards the\r\nPetitcodiac.  Besides, in his excitement at being thus saved from mere\r\nblind drifting, he did not much care where he went, for he felt assured\r\nthat he was now on the way out of his difficulties.\r\n\r\nIn an hour or two after leaving the ledge it grew quite dark, and Tom\r\nsaw that it would be necessary to prepare for the night.  His\r\npreparations were simple, consisting in eating a half dozen biscuit.\r\nHe now began to feel a little thirsty, but manfully struggled against\r\nthis feeling.  Gradually the darkness grew deeper, until at last it\r\nassumed the intense character of the preceding night.  But still Tom\r\nsat up, and the boat went on.  The wind did not slacken, nor did the\r\nboat's progress cease.  Hours passed by in this way.  As to the tides,\r\nTom could not tell now very well whether they were rising or falling,\r\nand, in fact, he was quite indifferent, being satisfied fully with his\r\nprogress.  As long as the wind distended his sail, and bore the boat\r\nonward, he cared not whether the tide favored or opposed.\r\n\r\nHours passed, but such was Tom's excitement that he still bore up, and\r\nthought nothing of rest or of sleep.  His attention was needed, too,\r\nand so he kept wide awake, and his ears were ever on the stretch to\r\nhear the slightest sound.  But at last the intense excitement and the\r\nlong fatigue began to overpower him.  Still he struggled against his\r\nweakness, and still he watched and listened.\r\n\r\nHours passed on, and the wind never ceased to fill the sail, and the\r\nboat never ceased to go onward in a course of which Tom could have no\r\nidea.  It was a course totally different from the one which be\r\nintended--a course which depended on the chance of the wind; and one,\r\ntoo, which was varied by the sweep of the tide as it rose or fell; but\r\nthe course, such as it was, continued on, and Tom watched and waited\r\nuntil, at last, from sheer exhaustion, he fell sound asleep.\r\n\r\nHis dreams were much disturbed, but he slept on soundly, and when he\r\nawaked it was broad day.  He looked around in deep disappointment. Fog\r\nwas everywhere, as before, and nothing could be seen.  Whether he was\r\nnear any shore or not he could not tell. Suddenly he noticed that the\r\nwind was blowing from an opposite direction.  How to account for this\r\nwas at first a mystery, for the fog still prevailed, and the opposite\r\nwind could not bring fog.  Was it possible that the boat had turned\r\nduring his sleep?  He knew that it was quite possible.  Indeed, he\r\nbelieved that this was the case. With this impression he determined to\r\nact on the theory that the boat had turned, and not that the wind had\r\nchanged.  The latter idea seemed impossible.  The wind was the chill,\r\ndamp fog wind--the sou-wester.  Convinced of this, Tom turned the boat,\r\nand felt satisfied that he had resumed his true course.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the wind went down, and the sail flapped idly against the\r\nmast.  Tom was in a fever of impatience, but could do nothing. He felt\r\nhimself to be once more at the mercy of the tides.  The wind had failed\r\nhim, and nothing was left but to drift.  All that day he drifted, and\r\nnight came on.  Still it continued calm.  Tom was weary and worn out,\r\nbut so intense was his excitement that he could not think of sleep.  At\r\nmidnight the wind sprung up a little; and now Tom determined to keep\r\nawake, so that the boat might not again double on her track.  He blamed\r\nhimself for sleeping on the previous night, and losing so much\r\nprogress.  Now he was determined to keep awake.\r\n\r\nHis resolution was carried out.  His intense eagerness to reach some\r\nshore, no matter where, and his fear of again losing what he had\r\ngained, kept sleep from his eyes.  All that night he watched his boat.\r\nThe wind blew fitfully, sometimes carrying the boat on rapidly, again\r\ndying down.\r\n\r\nSo the next morning came.\r\n\r\nIt was Thursday.\r\n\r\nIt was Monday night when he had drifted out, and all that time he had\r\nbeen on the deep, lost in the fog.\r\n\r\nAnd now, wearied, dejected, and utterly worn out, he looked around in\r\ndespair, and wondered where this would end.  Fog was everywhere, as\r\nbefore, and, as before, not a thing could be seen.\r\n\r\nHours passed on; the wind had sprang up fresh, and the boat went on\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tom sprang upright, and uttered a loud cry.\r\n\r\nThere full before him he saw a giant cliff, towering far overhead,\r\ntowards which the boat was sailing.  At its base the waves were\r\ndashing.  Over its brow trees were bending.  In the air far above he\r\nheard the hoarse cries of sea-gulls.\r\n\r\nIn his madness he let the boat drive straight on, and was close to it\r\nbefore he thought of his danger.  He could not avoid it now, however,\r\nfor he did not know how to turn the boat.  On it went, and in a few\r\nmoments struck the beach at the base of the cliff.\r\n\r\nThe tide was high; the breeze was moderate, and there was but little\r\nsun.  The boat was not injured by running ashore there.  Tom jumped\r\nout, and, taking the rope in his hands, walked along the rough and\r\nstony beach for about a hundred yards, pulling the boat after him.\r\nThere the cliff was succeeded by a steep slope, beyond which was a\r\ngentle, grass-grown declivity.  Towards this he bent his now feeble\r\nsteps, still tugging at the boat, and drawing it after him.\r\n\r\nAt length he reached the grassy slope, and found here a rough beach.\r\nHe fastened the boat securely to the trunk of a tree that grew near.\r\n\r\nThen he lifted out the box of biscuit, and over this he threw the sail.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a few moments on the bank, and looked all around for signs\r\nof some human habitation; but no signs appeared.  Tom was too exhausted\r\nto go in search of one.  He had not slept for more than thirty hours.\r\nThe country that he saw was cleared.  Hills were at a little distance,\r\nbut the fog which hung all around concealed everything from view.  One\r\nlook was enough.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed with gratitude, he fell upon his knees, and offered up a\r\nfervent prayer of thankfulness for his astonishing escape.\r\n\r\nThen fatigue overpowered him, and, rolling himself up in the sail, he\r\nwent to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nOff in Search.--Eager Outlook.--Nothing but Fog.--Speaking a\r\nSchooner.--Pleasant Anecdotes.--Cheer up.--The Heart of Corbet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of Bruce and Bart, Captain Corbet did not delay his\r\ndeparture much longer.  The vessel was already afloat, and though the\r\ntide was still rising, yet the wind was sufficiently favorable to\r\nenable her to go on her way.  The sails were soon set, and, with the\r\nnew boat in tow, the Antelope weighed anchor, and took her departure.\r\nFor about two hours but little progress was made against the strong\r\nopposing current; yet they had the satisfaction of reaching the mouth\r\nof the river, and by ten o'clock, when the tide turned and began to\r\nfall, they were fairly in the bay.  The wind here was ahead, but the\r\nstrong tide was now in their favor, and they hoped for some hours to\r\nmake respectable progress.\r\n\r\nDuring this time they had all kept an anxious lookout, but without any\r\nresult.  No floating craft of any kind appeared upon the surface of the\r\nwater.  Coming down the river, the sky was unclouded, and all the\r\nsurrounding scene was fully visible; but on reaching the bay, they saw\r\nbefore them, a few miles down, a lofty wall of light-gray cloud.\r\nCaptain Corbet waved his hand towards this.\r\n\r\n\"We're in for it,\" said he, \"or we precious soon will be.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Our old friend--a fog bank.  You'd ought to know it by this time,\r\nsure.\"\r\n\r\nThere it lay, a few miles off, and every minute brought them nearer.\r\nThe appearance of the fog threw an additional gloom over the minds of\r\nall, for they saw the hopeless character of their search.  Of what\r\navail would it be to traverse the seas if they were all covered by such\r\nthick mists?  Still nothing else was to be done, and they tried to hope\r\nfor the best.\r\n\r\n\"Any how,\" said Captain Corbet, \"thar's one comfort.  That thar fog may\r\ngo as quick as it come.  It ony needs a change of wind.  Why, I've\r\nknowed it all vanish in half an hour, an the fog as thick as it is now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But sometimes it lasts long--don't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think it did.  I've knowed it hang on for weeks.\"\r\n\r\nAt this gloomy statement the boys said not a word.\r\n\r\nSoon after the schooner approached the fog bank, and in a little while\r\nit had plunged into the midst of its misty folds.  The chill of the\r\ndamp clouds, as they enveloped them, struck additional chill to their\r\nhearts.  It was into the midst of this that poor Tom had drifted, they\r\nthought, and over these seas, amidst this impenetrable atmosphere, he\r\nmight even now be drifting.  In the midst of the deep dejection\r\nconsequent upon such thoughts, it was difficult for them to find any\r\nsolid ground for hope.\r\n\r\nThe wind was moderate, yet adverse, and the schooner had to beat\r\nagainst it.  As she went on each tack, they came in sight of the\r\nshores; but as time passed, the bay widened, and Captain Corbet kept\r\naway from the land as much as possible.  All the time the boys never\r\nceased to maintain their forlorn lookout, and watched over the sides,\r\nand peered anxiously through the mist, in the hope that the gloomy\r\nwaters might suddenly disclose to their longing eyes the form of the\r\ndrifting boat and their lost companion.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what it is, boys,\" said Captain Corbet, after a long and\r\nthoughtful silence; \"the best plan of acting in a biz of this kind is\r\nto pluck up sperrit an go on.  Why, look at me.  You mind the time when\r\nthat boat, that thar i-dentical, individdle boat, drifted away onst\r\nafore, with youns in it.  You remember all about that,--course.  Well,\r\nlook at me.  Did I mourn?  Did I fret?  Was I cast down?  Nary down;\r\nnot me.  I cheered up.  I cheered up Mr. Long.  I kep everybody in good\r\nsperrits.  An what was the result? Result was, you all turned up in\r\nprime order and condition, a enjyin of yourselves like all possessed,\r\nalong with old O'Rafferty.\r\n\r\n\"Again, my friends,\" he continued, as the boys made no remark,\r\n\"consider this life air short an full of vycissitoods.  Ups an downs\r\nair the lot of pore fallen hoomanity.  But if at the fust blast of\r\nmisforten we give up an throw up the game, what's the good of us?  The\r\nquestion now, an the chief pint, is this--Who air we, an whar air we\r\ngoin, an what air we purposin to do?  Fust, we air hooman beins;\r\nsecondly, we air a traversin the vast an briny main; and thirdly, we\r\nhope to find a certain friend of ourn, who was borne away from us by\r\nthe swellin tide.  Thar's a aim for us--a high an holy aim; an now I\r\nask you, as feller-critters, how had we ought to go about it?  Had we\r\nought to peek, an pine, an fret, an whine?  Had we ought to snivel, and\r\ngive it up at the fust?  Or had we ought, rayther, to be up an\r\ndoin,--pluck up our sperrits like men, and go about our important work\r\nwith energy?  Which of these two, my friends?  I pause for a reply.\"\r\n\r\nThis was quite a speech for Captain Corbet, and the effort seemed quite\r\nan exhaustive one.  He paused some time for a reply; but as no reply\r\nwas forthcoming, he continued his remarks.\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here,\" said he; \"this here whole business reminds me of a\r\nstory I once read in a noospaper, about a man up in this here identical\r\nriver, the Petticoat Jack, who, like a fool, pulled up his boat on the\r\nbank, and wont off to sleep in her.  Wal, as a matter of course, he\r\nfloated off,--for the tide happened to be risin,--an when he woke up\r\nout of his cool an refreshin slumbers, he found himself afar on the\r\nbriny deep, a boundin like 'a thing of life,' o'er the deep heavin sea.\r\nBesides, it was precious foggy,--jest as it is now,--an the man\r\ncouldn't see any more'n we can. Wal, the story went on to say, how that\r\nthar man, in that thar boat, went a driftin in that thar fashion, in\r\nthat thar fog; an he drifted, an drifted, an derifted, for days an\r\ndays, up an down, on one side an t'other side, an round every way,--an,\r\nmind you, he hadn't a bit to eat, or to drink either, for that\r\nmatter,--'t any rate, the paper didn't mention no such thing; an so,\r\nyou know, he drifted, an d-e-e-e-rifted,--until at last he druv ashore.\r\nAn now, whar d'ye think he druv?\"\r\n\r\nThe boys couldn't think.\r\n\r\n\"Guess, now.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys couldn't guess.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye guv it up?\"\r\n\r\nThey did.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, the paper said, he druv ashore at Grand Manan; but I've my doubts\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain paused, looked all around through the fog, and stood for a\r\nmoment as though listening to some sound.\r\n\r\n\"I kine o' thought,\" said he, \"that I detected the dash of water on the\r\nshore.  I rayther think it's time to bring her round.\"\r\n\r\nThe vessel was brought round on another tack, and the captain resumed\r\nhis conversation.\r\n\r\n\"What I was jest sayin,\" he continued, \"reminds me of a story I onst\r\nheard, or read, I forget which (all the same, though), about two boys\r\nwhich went adrift on a raft.  It took place up in Scott's Bay, I think,\r\nat a ship-yard in that thar locality.\r\n\r\n\"These two unfortunate children, it seems, had made a raft in a playful\r\nmude, an embarkin on it they had been amoosin theirselves with paddlin\r\nabout by pushin it with poles.  At length they came to a pint where\r\npoles were useless; the tide got holt of the raft, an the ferrail\r\nstructoor was speedily swept onward by the foorus current.  Very well.\r\nTime rolled on, an that thar raft rolled on too,--far over the deep\r\nbellew sea,--beaten by the howlin storm, an acted upon by the\r\nremorseless tides.  I leave you to pictoor to yourselves the sorrow of\r\nthem thar two infant unfortunits, thus severed from their hum an\r\nparients, an borne afar, an scarce enough close on to keep 'em from the\r\ninclemency of the weather.  So they drifted, an drifted, an\r\nde-e-rifted, until at last they druv ashore; an now, whar do you think\r\nit was that they druv?\"\r\n\r\nThe boys couldn't say.\r\n\r\n\"Guess now.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys declined.\r\n\r\n\"Try.\"\r\n\r\nThey couldn't.\r\n\r\n\"Name some place.\"\r\n\r\nThey couldn't think of any.\r\n\r\n\"D'ye guv it up?\" asked the captain, excitedly.\r\n\r\nThey did.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said he, in a triumphant tone, \"they druv ashore on Brier\r\nIsland; an ef that thar ain't pooty tall driftin, then I'm a Injine.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the boys had no reply to make.\r\n\r\n\"From all this,\" continued the captain, \"you must perceive that this\r\nhere driftin is very much more commoner than you hev ben inclined to\r\nbleeve it to be.  You also must see that thar's every reason for hope.\r\nSo up with your gizzards!  Pluck up your sperrits!  Rise and look\r\nfortin an the footoor squar in the face. Squar off at fortin, an hav it\r\nout with her on the spot.  I don't want to hev you go mopin an whinin\r\nabout this way.  Hello!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet suddenly interrupted his remarks by an exclamation. The\r\nexclamation was caused by the sudden appearance of a sail immediately\r\nto windward.  She was coming up the bay before the wind, and came\r\nswiftly through the fog towards them.  In passing on her way, she came\r\nastern of the Antelope.\r\n\r\n\"Schooner, ahoy!\" cried Captain Corbet; and some conversation took\r\nplace, in which they learned that the stranger was the schooner Wave,\r\nfrom St. John, and that she had not seen any signs whatever of any\r\ndrifting boat.\r\n\r\nThis news was received sadly by the boys, and Captain Corbet had to\r\nexert his utmost to rouse them from their depression, but without much\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how it is,\" said he, plaintively, \"but somehow your blues\r\nair contiguous, an I feel as ef I was descendin into a depression as\r\ndeep as yourn.  I don't remember when I felt so depressed, cept last\r\nMay--time I had to go off in the Antelope with taters, arter I thought\r\nI'd done with seafarin for the rest of my life.  But that thar vessel\r\nwar wonderously resussutated, an the speouse of my buzzum druv me away\r\nto traverse the sea.  An I had to tar myself away from the clingin\r\ngerasp of my weepin infant,--the tender bud an bulossum of an old man's\r\nlife--tar myself away, an feel myself a outcast.  Over me hovered\r\ncontennooly the image of the pinin infant, an my heart quivered with\r\nresponsive sympathy. An I yearned--an I pined--an I groaned--an I felt\r\nthat life would be intoll'ble till I got back to the babby.  An so it\r\nwas that I passed away, an had scace the heart to acknowledge your\r\nyouthful cheers.  Wal, time rolled on, an what's the result?  Here I\r\nair. Do I pine now?  Do I peek?  Not a pine!  Not a peek!  As tender a\r\nheart as ever bet still beats in this aged frame; but I am no longer a\r\npurray to sich tender reminiscinsuz of the babby as onst used to\r\nconsume my vitals.\"\r\n\r\nThus it was that the venerable captain talked with the boys, and it was\r\nthus that he sought, by every possible means, to cheer them up. In this\r\nway the day passed on, and after five or six hours they began to look\r\nfor a turn of tide.  During this time the schooner had been beating;\r\nand as the fog was as thick as ever, it was impossible for the boys to\r\ntell where they were.  Indeed, it did not seem as though they had been\r\nmaking any progress.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to anchor soon,\" said the captain, closing his eyes and\r\nturning his face meditatively to the quarter whence the wind came.\r\n\r\n\"Anchor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, you see it'll soon be dead low tide, an we can't go on any\r\nfurther when it turns.  We'll have wind an tide both agin us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far have we come now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, we've come a pooty considerable of a lick now--mind I tell you.\r\n'Tain't, of course, as good as ef the wind had ben favorable, but arter\r\nall, that thar tide was a pooty considerable of a tide, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will you anchor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, till the next tarn of tide,--course.\"\r\n\r\n\"When will that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, somewhar about eleven o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eleven o'clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's almost midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Course it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be better to cruise off in the bay?  It seems to me\r\nanything is better than keeping still.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, young sir; it seems to me that jest now anythin is better than\r\ntryin to cruise in the bay, with a flood tide a comin up.  Why, whar\r\nd'ye think we'd be?  It would ony take an hour or two to put us on Cape\r\nChignecto, or Cape d'Or, onto a place that we wouldn't git away from in\r\na hurry,--mind I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nTo this, of course, the boys had nothing to say.  So, after a half\r\nhour's further sail, the anchor was dropped, and the Antelope stopped\r\nher wanderings for a time.\r\n\r\nTedious as the day had been, it was now worse.  The fog was as thick as\r\never, the scene was monotonous, and there was nothing to do.  Even\r\nSolomon's repasts had, in a great measure, lost their attractions.  He\r\nhad spread a dinner for them, which at other times, and under happier\r\ncircumstances, would have been greeted with uproarious enthusiasm; but\r\nat the present time it was viewed with comparative indifference.  It\r\nwas the fog that threw this gloom over them.  Had the sky been clear,\r\nand the sun shining, they would have viewed the situation with\r\ncomparative equanimity; but the fog threw terror all its own around\r\nTom's position; and by shutting them in on every side, it forced them\r\nto think of him who was imprisoned in the same way--their lost\r\ncompanion, who now was drifting in the dark.  Besides, as long as they\r\nwere in motion, they had the consciousness that they were doing\r\nsomething, and that of itself was a comfort; but now, even that\r\nconsolation was taken away from them, and in their forced inaction they\r\nfell back again into the same despondency which they had felt at\r\nPetitcodiac.\r\n\r\n\"It's all this fog, I do believe,\" said Captain Corbet.  \"If it want\r\nfor this you'd all cheer up, an be as merry as crickets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any prospect of its going away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, not jest yet.  You can't reckon on it.  When it chooses to go\r\naway, it does so.  It may hang on for weeks, an p'aps months. Thar's no\r\ntellin.  I don't mind it, bein as I've passed my hull life in the\r\nmiddle of fog banks; but I dare say it's a leetle tryin to youns.\"\r\n\r\nThe repast that Solomon spread for them on that evening was scarce\r\ntasted, and to all his coaxings and remonstrances the boys made no\r\nreply.  After the tea was over, they went on deck, and stared silently\r\ninto the surrounding gloom.  The sight gave them no relief, and gave no\r\nhope.  In that dense fog twilight came on soon, and with the twilight\r\ncame the shadows of the night more rapidly. At last it grew quite dark,\r\nand finally there arose all around them the very blackness of darkness.\r\n\r\n\"The best thing to do,\" said Captain Corbet, \"is to go to sleep. In all\r\nkinds of darkness, whether intunnel or extunnel, I've allus found the\r\nbest plan to be to sleep it off.  An I've knowed great men who war of\r\nmy opinion.  Sleep, then, young sirs, while yet you may, while yer\r\nyoung blood is warm, an life is fresh an fair, an don't put it off to\r\nold age, like me, for you mayn't be able to do it.  Look at me!  How\r\nmuch d'ye think I've slep sence I left Mud Creek?  Precious little.  I\r\ndon't know how it is, but bein alone with you, an havin the\r\nrespons'bility of you all, I kine o' don't feel altogether able to\r\nsleep as I used to do; an sence our late loss--I--wal, I feel as though\r\nI'd never sleep agin.  I'm talkin an talkin, boys, but it's a solemn\r\ntime with me.  On me, boys, rests the fate of that lad, an I'll scour\r\nthese here seas till he turns up, ef I hev to do it till I die.\r\nAnxious?  Yes, I am.  I'm that anxious that the diskivery of the lost\r\nboy is now the one idee of my life, for which I forget all else; but\r\nallow me to say, at the same time, that I fully, furmly, an\r\nconshuentiously bleve an affum, that my conviction is, that that thar\r\nlad is bound to turn up all right in the end--right side up--with\r\ncare--sound in every respect, in good order an condition, jest as when\r\nfust shipped on board the good schooner Antelope, Corbet master, for\r\nPetticoat Jack, as per bill ladin.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain's tones were mournful.  He heaved a deep sigh as he\r\nconcluded, and relapsed into a profound and melancholy silence.\r\n\r\nThe boys waited on deck for some time longer, and finally followed his\r\nadvice, and sought refuge below.  They were young and strong, and the\r\nfatigue which they felt brought on drowsiness, which, in spite of their\r\nanxiety, soon deepened into sleep.  All slept, and at length Captain\r\nCorbet only was awake.  It was true enough, as he had said, the fate of\r\nthe lost boy rested upon him, and he felt it. His exhortations to the\r\nboys about keeping up their courage, and his stories about lost men who\r\nhad drifted to a final rescue, were all spoken more with reference to\r\nhimself than to them.  He sought to keep up his own courage by these\r\nwords.  Yet, in spite of his efforts, a profound depression came over\r\nhim, and well nigh subdued him.  No one knew better than he the many\r\nperils which beset the drifting boat in these dangerous waters--the\r\nperils of storm, the perils of fog, the perils of thick darkness, the\r\nperils of furious tides, the perils of sunken rocks, of shoals, and of\r\niron-bound coasts.  The boys had gone to sleep, but there was no sleep\r\nfor him.  He wandered restlessly about, and heavy sighs escaped him.\r\nThus the time passed with him until near midnight.  Then he roused the\r\nmate, and they raised the anchor and hoisted the sails.  It was now the\r\nturn of tide, and the waters were falling again, and the current once\r\nmore ran down the bay.  To this current he trusted the vessel again,\r\nbeating, as before, against the head wind, which was still blowing; and\r\nthus the Antelope worked her way onward through all that dark and\r\ndismal night, until at last the faint streaks of light in the east\r\nproclaimed the dawn of another day.\r\n\r\nThrough all that night the boys slept soundly.  The wind blew, the\r\nwaves dashed, but they did not awake.  The anchor was hoisted, and the\r\nsails were set, but the noise failed to rouse them.  Weariness of body\r\nand anxiety of mind both conspired to make their sleep profound.  Yet\r\nin that profound sleep the anxiety of their minds made itself manifest;\r\nand in their dreams their thoughts turned to their lost companion.\r\nThey saw him drifting over the stormy waters, enveloped in midnight\r\ndarkness, chilled through with the damp night air, pierced to the bone\r\nby the cold night wind; drifting on amid a thousand dangers, now swept\r\non by furious tides towards rocky shores, and again drawn back by\r\nrefluent currents over vast sunken sea-ledges, white with foam.  Thus\r\nthrough all the night they slept, and as they slept the Antelope dashed\r\non through the waters, whose foaming waves, as they tumbled against her\r\nsides and over her bows, sent forth sounds that mingled with their\r\ndreams, and became intermingled with poor Tom's mournful cries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nAwake once more.--Where are we?--The giant cliff.--Out to\r\nSea.--Anchoring and Drifting.--The Harbor.--The Search.--No\r\nAnswer.--Where's Solomon?\r\n\r\n\r\nScarce had the streaks of light greeted Captain Corbet's eyes, and\r\ngiven him the grateful prospect of another day, when the boys awaked\r\nand hurried up on deck.  Their first act was to take a hurried look all\r\naround.  The same gloomy and dismal prospect appeared--black water and\r\nthick, impenetrable fog.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we now, Captain?\" asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, a con-siderable distance down the bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal--I've about made up my mind whar to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinkin of puttin into Quaco.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quaco?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is it from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very fur, 'cordin to my calc'lations.  My idee is, that the boat\r\nmay have drifted down along here and got ashore.  Ef so, he may have\r\nmade for Quaco, an its jest possible that we may hear about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this the most likely place for a boat to go ashore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, all things considered, a boat is more likely to go ashore on the\r\nNew Brunswick side, driftin from Petticoat Jack; but at the same time\r\n'tain't at all certain.  Thar's ony a ghost of a chance, mind.  I don't\r\nfeel over certain about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will we get to Quaco this tide?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scacely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you intend to anchor again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I rayther think I'll hev to do it.  But we'd ought to get to\r\nQuaco by noon, I calc'late.   I'm a thinkin--Hello!  Good gracious!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain's sudden exclamation interrupted his words, and made all\r\nturn to look at the object that had called it forth.  One glance showed\r\nan object which might well have elicited even a stronger expression of\r\namazement and alarm.\r\n\r\nImmediately in front of them arose a vast cliff,--black, rocky,\r\nfrowning,--that ascended straight up from the deep water, its summit\r\nlost in the thick fog, its base white with the foaming waves that\r\nthundered there.  A hoarse roar came up from those breaking waves,\r\nwhich blended fearfully with the whistle of the wind through the\r\nrigging, and seemed like the warning sound of some dark, drear fate.\r\nThe cliff was close by, and the schooner had been steering straight\r\ntowards it.  So near was it that it seemed as though one could have\r\neasily tossed a biscuit ashore.\r\n\r\nBut though surprised, Captain Corbet was not in the least confused, and\r\ndid not lose his presence of mind for a moment.  Putting the helm hard\r\nup, he issued the necessary commands in a cool, quiet manner; the\r\nvessel went round, and in a few moments the danger was passed.  Yet so\r\nclose were they, that in wearing round it seemed as though one could\r\nalmost have jumped from the stern upon the rocky shelves which appeared\r\nin the face of the lofty cliff.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\"That's about the nighest scratch I remember ever havin had,\" was his\r\nremark, as the Antelope went away from the land.  \"Cur'ous, too; I\r\ndon't see how it happened.  I lost my reckonin a little. I'm a mile\r\nfurther down than I calc'lated on bein.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that place?\" asked Bart.\r\n\r\n\"Course I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's lucky for us we didn't go there at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is rayther lucky; but then there wan't any danger o' that,\r\ncos, you see, I kep the vessel off by night, an the danger couldn't hev\r\nriz.  I thought we were a mile further up the bay; we've been a doin\r\nbetter than I thought for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we be able to get into Quaco any sooner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, not much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought from what you said that we were a mile nearer.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we air, but that don't make any very great difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we ought to get in all the sooner, I should think.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; not much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?  I don't understand that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, you see it's low tide now.\"\r\n\r\n\"The tides again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it's allus the tides that you must consider here.  Wal, it's low\r\ntide now, an the tide's already on the turn, an risin.  We've got to\r\nanchor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anchor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, agin.  Even so.  Ef we didn't anchor we'd only be drifted up\r\nagain, ever so far, an lose all that we've ben a gainin.  We're not\r\nmore'n a mile above Quaco Harbor, but we can't fetch it with wind an\r\ntide agin us; so we've got to put out some distance an anchor. It's my\r\nfirm belief that we'll be in Quaco by noon.  The next fallin tide will\r\ncarry us thar as slick as a whistle, an then we can pursue our\r\ninvestigations.\"\r\n\r\nThe schooner now held on her course for about a mile away from the\r\nshore, and then came to anchor.  The boys had for a moment lost sight\r\nof this unpleasant necessity, and had forgotten that they had been\r\nusing up the hours of the ebb tide while asleep.  There was no help for\r\nit, however, and they found, to their disgust, another day of fog, and\r\nof inaction.\r\n\r\nTime passed, and breakfast came.  Solomon now had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing them eat more, and gave manifest signs of that satisfaction by\r\nthe twinkle of his eye and the lustre of his ebony brow.  After this\r\nthe time passed on slowly and heavily; but at length eleven o'clock\r\ncame, and passed, and in a short time they were once more under way.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to Quaco now--arn't we?\" asked Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; right straight on into Quaco Harbor, fair an squar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how it's possible for you to know so perfectly where you\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Young sir, there ain't a nook, nor a corner, nor a hole, nor a stun,\r\nin all the outlinin an configoortion of this here bay but what's mapped\r\nout an laid down all c'rect in this here brain.  I'd undertake to\r\nnavigate these waters from year's end to year's end, ef I was never to\r\nsee the sun at all, an even ef I was to be perpetooly surrounded by all\r\nthe fogs that ever riz.  Yea, verily, and moreover, not only this here\r\nbay, but the hull coast all along to Bosting.  Why, I'm at home here on\r\nthe rollin biller.  I'm the man for Mount Desert, an Quoddy Head, an\r\nGrand Manan, an all other places that air ticklish to the ginrality of\r\nseafarin men.  Why, young sir, you see before you, in the humble an\r\nunassumin person of the aged Corbet, a livin, muvin, and sea-goin\r\nedition of Blunt's Coast Pilot, revised and improved to a precious\r\nsight better condition than it's ever possible for them fellers in\r\nBosting to get out.  By Blunt's Coast Pilot, young sir, I allude to a\r\ncelebrated book, as big as a pork bar'l, that every skipper has in his\r\nlocker, to guide him on his wanderin way--ony me.  I don't have no call\r\nto use sech, being myself a edition of useful information techin all\r\ncoastin matters.\"\r\n\r\nThe Antelope now proceeded quickly on her way.  Several miles were\r\ntraversed.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys, look sharp,\" said the captain; \"you'll soon see the\r\nsettlement.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked sharp.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments they went onward through the water, and at length\r\nthere was visible just before them what seemed like a dark cloud\r\nextending all along.  A few minutes further progress made the dark\r\ncloud still darker, and, advancing further, the dark cloud finally\r\ndisclosed itself as a line of coast.  It was close by them, and, even\r\nwhile they were recognizing it as land, they saw before them the\r\noutline of a wharf.\r\n\r\n\"Good agin!\" cried the captain.  \"I didn't come to the wharf I wanted,\r\nbut this here'll do as well as any other, an I don't know but what\r\nit'll do better.  Here we air, boys.  Stand by thar, mate, to let fall\r\nthe jib.\"\r\n\r\nOn they went, and in a few minutes more the Antelope wore round, and\r\nher side just grazed the wharf.  The mate jumped ashore, lines were\r\nsecured, and the Antelope lay in safety.\r\n\r\n\"An now, boys, we may all go ashore, an see if we can hear anything\r\nabout the boat.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words Captain Corbet stepped upon the wharf, followed by all\r\nthe boys, and they all went up together, till they found themselves on\r\na road.  There they saw a shop, and into this they entered.  No time\r\nwas to be lost; the captain at once told his story, and asked his\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe answer was soon made.\r\n\r\nNothing whatever was known there about any boat.  Two or three\r\nschooners had arrived within two days, and the shopkeeper had seen the\r\nskippers, but they had not mentioned any boat.  No boat had drifted\r\nashore anywhere near, nor had any strange lad arrived at the settlement.\r\n\r\nThis intelligence depressed them all.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, wal,\" said the captain, \"I didn't have much hopes; it's jest as I\r\nfeared; but, at the same time, I'll ask further.  An first and foremost\r\nI'll go an see them schooners.\"\r\n\r\nHe then went off with the boys in search of the schooners just\r\nmentioned.  These were found without difficulty.  One had come from up\r\nthe bay, another from St. John, and a third from Eastport.  None of\r\nthem had encountered anything like a drilling boat.  The one from up\r\nthe bay afforded them the greatest puzzle.  She must have come down the\r\nvery night of Tom's accident.  If he did drift down the bay in his\r\nboat, he must have been not very far from the schooner.  In clear\r\nweather he could not have escaped notice; but the skipper had seen\r\nnothing, and heard nothing.  He had to beat down against the wind, and\r\nanchor when the tide was rising; but, though he thus traversed so great\r\nan extent of water, nothing whatever attracted his attention.\r\n\r\n\"This sets me thinkin,\" said the captain, \"that, perhaps, he mayn't\r\nhave drifted down at all.  He may have run ashore up thar.  Thar's a\r\nchance of it, an we must all try to think of that, and cheer up, as\r\nlong as we can.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the schooners, the captain now went through the settlement, and\r\nmade a few inquiries, with no further result.  Nothing had been heard\r\nby any one about any drifting boat, and they were at last compelled to\r\nsee that in Quaco there was no further hope of gaining any information\r\nwhatever about Tom.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the captain informed the boys that he was going back to the\r\nschooner to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't slep a wink,\" said he, \"sence we left Grand Pre, and that's\r\nmore'n human natur can ginrally stand; so now I'm bound to have my\r\nsleep out, an prepare for the next trip.  You boys had better emply\r\nyourselves in inspectin this here village.\"\r\n\r\n\"When shall we leave Quaco?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I'll think that over.  I haven't yet made up my mind as to what's\r\nbest to be done next.  One thing seems certain.  There ain't no use\r\ngoin out in this fog, an I've half a mind to wait here till to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,--an then go down to St. John.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what'll poor Tom be doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's my firm belief that he's all right,\" said Captain Corbet,\r\nconfidently.  \"At any rate, you'd better walk about now, an I'll try an\r\ngit some sleep.\"\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing better to be done, the boys did as he proposed,\r\nand wandered about the village.  It was about two miles long, with\r\nhouses scattered at intervals along the single street of which it was\r\ncomposed, with here, and there a ship-yard.  At one end was a long,\r\nprojecting ledge, with a light-house; at the other there was a romantic\r\nvalley, through which a stream ran into the bay.  On the other side of\r\nthis stream were cliffs of sandstone rocks, in which were deep,\r\ncavernous hollows, worn by the waves; beyond this, again, was a long\r\nline of a precipitous shore, in whose sides were curious shelves, along\r\nwhich it was possible to walk for a great distance, with the sea\r\nthundering on the rocks beneath.  At any other time they would have\r\ntaken an intense enjoyment in a place like this, where there were so\r\nmany varied scenes; but now their sense of enjoyment was blunted, for\r\nthey carried in their minds a perpetual anxiety.  None the less,\r\nhowever, did they wander about, penetrating up the valley, exploring\r\nthe caverns, and traversing the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThey did not return to the schooner till dusk.  It would not be high\r\ntide till midnight, and so they prolonged their excursion purposely, so\r\nas to use up the time.  On reaching the schooner they were welcomed by\r\nCaptain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"I declar, boys,\" said he, \"I'm getting to be a leetle the biggest old\r\nfool that ever lived.  It's all this accident.  It's onmanned me.  I\r\nhad a nap for two or three hours, but waked at six, an ever sence I've\r\nbeen a worretin an a frettin about youns.  Sence that thar accident, I\r\ncan't bar to have you out of my sight, for I fear all the time that you\r\nar gettin into mischief.  An now I've been skeart for two mortal hours,\r\na fancyin you all tumblin down from the cliffs, or a strugglin in the\r\nwaters.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, we can take care of ourselves, captain,\" said Bart\r\n\r\n\"No, you can't--not you.  I wouldn't trust one of you.  I'm getting to\r\nbe a feeble creetur too,--so don't go away agin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't think we'll have a chance in Quaco.  Arn't we going to\r\nleave to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, that thar is jest the pint that I've been moosin on.  You see\r\nit's thick; the fog's as bad as ever.  What's the use of going out\r\nto-night?  Now, ef we wait till to-morrow, it may be clear, an then we\r\ncan decide what to do.\"\r\n\r\nAt this proposal, the boys were silent for a time.  The experience\r\nwhich they had formed of the bay and its fogs showed them how useless\r\nwould be any search by night, and the prospect of a clear day, and,\r\npossibly, a more favorable wind on the morrow, was very attractive.\r\nThe question was debated by all, and considered in all its bearings,\r\nand the discussion went on until late, when it was finally decided that\r\nit would be, on the whole, the wisest course to wait until the\r\nfollowing day.  Not the least influential of the many considerations\r\nthat occurred was their regard for Captain Corbet.  They saw that he\r\nwas utterly worn out for want of sleep, and perceived how much he\r\nneeded one night's rest.  This finally decided them.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning they were all up, and eager to see if\r\nthere was any change in the weather.  The first glance around elicited\r\na cry of admiration from all of them.  Above, all was clear and bright.\r\nThe sun was shining with dazzling lustre; the sky was of a deep blue,\r\nand without a cloud on its whole expanse; while the wide extent of the\r\nbay spread out before them, blue like the sky above, which it mirrored,\r\nand throwing up its waves to catch the sunlight.  A fresh north wind\r\nwas blowing, and all the air and all the sea was full of light and joy.\r\n\r\nThe scene around was in every respect magnificent.  The tide was low,\r\nand the broad beach, which now was uncovered by the waters, spread afar\r\nto the right and left in a long crescent that extended for miles.  On\r\nits lower extremity it was terminated by a ledge of black rocks, with\r\nthe light-house before spoken of, while its upper end was bounded by\r\ncavernous cliffs of red sandstone, which were crowned with tufted\r\ntrees.  Behind them were the white houses of the village, straggling\r\nirregularly on the borders of the long road, with here and there the\r\nunfinished fabric of some huge ship; while in the background were\r\nwooded hills and green sloping fields. Out on the bay a grander scene\r\nappeared.  Far down arose a white wall, which marked the place where\r\nthe fog clouds were sullenly retreating; immediately opposite, and\r\nforty miles away over the water, arose the long line of the Nova Scotia\r\ncoast, which bounded the horizon; while far up arose Cape Chignecto,\r\nand beside it towered up the dark form of a lonely island, which they\r\nknew, in spite of the evident distortion of its shape, to be no other\r\nthan Ile Haute.\r\n\r\nThe wondrous effects which can be produced by the atmosphere were never\r\nmore visible to their eyes than now.  The coast of Nova Scotia rose\r\nhigh in the air, dark in color, apparently only half its actual\r\ndistance away, while the summit of that coast seemed as level as a\r\ntable.  It seemed like some vast structure which had been raised out of\r\nthe water during the night by some magic power. Ile Haute arose to an\r\nextraordinary height, its summit perfectly level, its sides perfectly\r\nperpendicular, and its color a dark purple hue.  Nor was Cape Chignecto\r\nless changed.  The rugged cliff arose with magnified proportions to a\r\nmajestic height, and took upon itself the same sombre color, which\r\npervaded the whole of the opposite coast.\r\n\r\nAnother discussion was now begun as to their best plan of action. After\r\ntalking it all over, it was finally decided to go to St. John.  There\r\nthey would have a better opportunity of hearing about Tom; and there,\r\ntoo, if they did hear, they could send messages to him, or receive them\r\nfrom him.  So it was decided to leave at about eleven o'clock, without\r\nwaiting for high tide; for, as the wind was fair, they could go on\r\nwithout difficulty.  After coming to this conclusion, and learning that\r\nthe tide would not be high enough to float the schooner until eleven,\r\nthey all took breakfast, and stimulated by the exhilarating atmosphere\r\nand the bright sunshine, they dispersed down the village towards the\r\nlight-house.\r\n\r\nBy ten o'clock they were back again.  The tide was not yet up, and they\r\nwaited patiently.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, captain,\" asked Bart, \"what's become of Solomon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Solomon?  O, he took a basket an went off on a kine o' foragin tower.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foraging?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  He said he'd go along the shore, and hunt for lobsters.\"\r\n\r\n\"The shore?  What shore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, away up thar,\" said the captain, pointing towards the headland at\r\nthe upper end of the village.\r\n\r\n\"How long since?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, jest arter breakfast.  It must hev ben afore seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's strange that he hasn't got back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he'd ought to be back by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can't get any lobsters now; the tide is too high.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a fact.\"\r\n\r\nThey waited half an hour.  The rising tide already touched the\r\nAntelope's keel.\r\n\r\n\"Solomon ought to be back,\" cried Bart, starting up.\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid something's happened.  He's been gone too long.  Two hours\r\nwere enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys all looked at one another with anxious faces.\r\n\r\n\"If he went up that shore,\" said Bart, \"he may have got caught by the\r\ntide.  It's a very dangerous place for anybody--let alone an old man\r\nlike him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, he did go up thar; he said partic'lar that he wanted to find\r\nsomethin of a relish, an would hunt up thar.  He said, too, he'd be\r\nback by nine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm certain something's happened,\" cried Bart, more anxiously than\r\nbefore.  \"If he's gone up there, he's been caught by the tide.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stared, and looked uneasy.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I must say, that thar's not onlikely.  It's a bad place, a\r\ndreadful bad place,--an him an old man,--a dreadful bad place. He'd be\r\ndown here by this time, ef he was alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't wait any longer,\" cried Bart.  \"I must go and see.  Come\r\nalong, boys.  Don't let's leave poor old Solomon in danger.  Depend\r\nupon it, he's caught up there somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I think you're right,\" said Captain Corbet, \"an I'll go too. But\r\nef we do go, we'd better go with some preparations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Preparations?  What kind of preparations?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, ony a rope or two,\" said Captain Corbet; and taking a coil of rope\r\nover his arm, he stepped ashore, and all the boys hurried after him.\r\n\r\n\"I feel kine o' safer with a kile o' rope,--bein a seafarin man,\" he\r\nremarked.  \"Give a seafarin man a rope, an he'll go anywhar an do\r\nanythin.  He's like a spider onto a web.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nTom ashore.--Storm at Night.--Up in the Morning.--The Cliffs and the\r\nBeach.--A startling Discovery.--A desert Island.--A desperate\r\nEffort.--Afloat again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom slept soundly for a long time in the spot where he had flung\r\nhimself.  The sense of security came to the assistance of his wearied\r\nlimbs, and lulled him into profounder slumbers.  There was nothing here\r\nthat might rudely awaken him--no sudden boat shocks, no tossings and\r\nheavings of waves, no hoarse, menacing thunders of wrathful surges from\r\nrocky shores; nor were there distressing dreams to harass him, or any\r\nanxieties carried from his waking hours into the land of slumbers to\r\nannoy and to arouse.  From Monday night until this time on Thursday, he\r\nhad known but little sleep, and much fatigue and sorrow.  Now the\r\nfatigue and the sorrow were all forgotten, and the sleep was all his\r\nown.  Not a thought had he given to the land which he had reached so\r\nstrangely.  It was enough for him that he felt the solid ground beneath\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nFor hours he slept there, lying there like a log, wrapped in the old\r\nsail, moving not a limb, but given up altogether to his refreshing\r\nslumber.  At length he waked, and, uncovering his head, looked around.\r\nAt first he thought that he was in the boat, then he grew bewildered,\r\nand it was only after a persistent effort of memory that he could\r\nrecollect his position.\r\n\r\nHe looked all around, but nothing was visible.  There was nothing\r\naround him but darkness, intense and utter.  It was like the\r\nimpenetrable veil that had enshrouded him during the night of his\r\nmemorable voyage.  He could not see where his boat was.  A vague idea\r\nwhich he had of examining its fastening was dismissed.  He felt hungry,\r\nand found the biscuit box lying under one corner of the sail.  A few of\r\nthese were sufficient to gratify his hunger. Nothing more could be\r\ndone, and he saw plainly that it would be necessary for him to wait\r\nthere patiently until morning.  Once more, therefore, he rolled himself\r\nup in the sail, and tried to go to sleep.  But at first his efforts\r\nwere vain.  The first fatigue had passed away, and now that he had been\r\nrefreshed by sleep, his mind was too much occupied by thoughts of his\r\npast voyage to be readily lulled to sleep again.  He could not help\r\nwondering what Captain Corbet and the boys were doing.  That they were\r\nsearching for him everywhere he well knew, but which direction they had\r\nchosen he could not tell.  And what was the place whither he had\r\ndrifted?  He felt confident that it was the mouth of the Petitcodiac,\r\nand could not help wondering at the accuracy of his course; yet, while\r\nwondering, he modestly refrained from taking the credit of it to\r\nhimself, and rather chose to attribute it to the wind and tide.  It was\r\nby committing himself so completely to their guidance, he thought, that\r\nhe had done so well.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such thoughts as these, Tom became aware of the howling\r\nof the wind and the dash of the waters.  Putting forth his head, he\r\nfound that there was quite a storm arising; and this only added to his\r\ncontentment.  No fear had he now, on this solid ground, of rising wind\r\nor swelling wave.  Even the fog had lost its terrors.  It was with\r\nfeelings like these that he once more covered up his head from the\r\nnight blast; and not long after he was once more asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he next awaked, it was day.  Starting to his feet, he looked\r\naround him, and shouted for joy.  The sky was clear.  The sun was\r\nrising, and its rays, coming from over the distant hills, were\r\nglittering over the surface of the water.  The wind had changed. The\r\nfog had dispersed.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he seen this than he was filled with curiosity to know\r\nwhere he was.  This did not look much like the mouth of the\r\nPetitcodiac.  He stared around with a very strange sensation.\r\n\r\nImmediately beside him, where he was standing, the easy slope went back\r\nfor a hundred yards or so, covered with short, wild grass, with here\r\nand there a stunted tree.  Turning round, he saw the land rising by a\r\nsteep acclivity towards the heights which bordered on the sea in such\r\ntremendous cliffs.  Over the heights, and along the crest of those\r\ncliffs, were flying great flocks of sea-gulls, which kept up one\r\nincessant chorus of harsh, discordant screams.  In front of him spread\r\nout a broad sheet of water, on the opposite side of which arose a lofty\r\nline of coast.  Into this there penetrated a long strait, beyond which\r\nhe could see broad waters and distant shores--a bay within a bay,\r\napproached by this strait. On each side of the strait were lofty,\r\ntowering cliffs; and on one side, in particular, the cliffs were\r\nperpendicular, and ran on in a long and unbroken wall.  The extremity\r\nof the cliff nearest him was marked by a gigantic mass of broken rock,\r\ndetached from the main land, and standing alone in awful grandeur.\r\n\r\nWhat place was this?  Was this the mouth of the Petitcodiac?  Was that\r\nbroad bay a river?  Was he still dreaming, or what did it all mean?\r\nAnd that gigantic fragment severed from a cliff, which thus stood guard\r\nat the entrance of a long strait, what was that?  Could it be possible?\r\nWas there indeed any other broken cape, or could it be possible that\r\nthis was Cape Split?\r\n\r\nHe hurried up the slope, and on reaching the top, saw that it descended\r\non the other side towards the water.  This water was a broad sheet,\r\nwhich extended for seven or eight miles, and was terminated by a lofty\r\ncoast that extended down the bay as far as the eye could reach.  One\r\ncomprehensive glance was sufficient.  He saw it all, and understood it\r\nall.  It was not the mouth of the Petitcodiac River.  It was the\r\nentrance to the Basin of Minas that lay before him.  There lay the\r\ngreat landmarks, seen under new aspects, it is true, yet now\r\nsufficiently distinguishable.  There was the Nova Scotia coast.  In\r\nyonder hollow was Scott's Bay.  That giant rock was Cape Split.  The\r\nlong channel was the Strait of Minas, and the cliffs opposite were Cape\r\nd'Or and Cape Chignecto.\r\n\r\nAnd now the recognition of all these places brought to him a great and\r\nsudden shock.\r\n\r\nFor what was this place on which he stood?  Was it any part of the main\r\nland?\r\n\r\nIt was not.\r\n\r\nHe looked around.\r\n\r\nIt was an island.\r\n\r\nHe saw its lofty cliffs, its wooded crest, its flocks of sea-gulls, its\r\nsloping east end, where he stood, running down to a low point. He had\r\nseen them all at a distance before; and now that he stood here, he\r\nrecognized all.\r\n\r\nHe was on Ile Haute!\r\n\r\nThe moment that he recognized this startling fact, he thought of his\r\nboat.  He hurried to the beach.  The tide was very low.  To his immense\r\nrelief he found the fastening of the boat secure, and he turned away at\r\nonce, without any further examination, to think over his situation, and\r\nconsider the best plan for reaching the main land.  Making a\r\ncomfortable seat for himself on the sail, he sat down, and drawing out\r\nthe box, he took some biscuit.  Then feeling thirsty, he went off in\r\nsearch of fresh water.  Before he had walked many paces he found a\r\nbrook.\r\n\r\nThe brook was a small one, which ran from the lofty west end of the\r\nisland to the low land of the east, and thence into the bay.  The water\r\nwas good, and Tom satisfied his thirst by a long draught.\r\n\r\nJudging by the position of the sun, it was now about seven o'clock in\r\nthe morning; and Tom seated himself once more, and began to try to\r\nthink how it was that he should have come in a direction so entirely\r\ndifferent from the one which he had believed himself to be taking.  He\r\nhad fully expected to land at Petitcodiac, and he found himself far\r\naway on the other side of the bay.  Yet a little reflection showed him\r\nhow useless it was to try to recall his past voyage, and how impossible\r\nit was for him to account for it, ignorant as he was of the true\r\ndirection of the wind and of the tide.  He contented himself with\r\nmarking a rude outline of his course on his memorandum book, making\r\nallowance for the time when he turned on that course; and having summed\r\nit all up to his own satisfaction in a crooked line which looked like a\r\nslip-knot, he turned his attention to more important matters.\r\n\r\nThere was one matter of first-rate importance which now pressed itself\r\nupon his thoughts, and that was, how to escape from his present\r\nsituation.  As far as he could see, there was no inhabitant on the\r\nisland, no house, no cultivation, and no domestic animal. If there had\r\nbeen anything of that kind, they would be visible, he knew, from the\r\npoint where he was standing.  But all was deserted; and beyond the open\r\nground in his neighborhood arose the east end, wooded all over its\r\nlofty summit.  From Captain Corbet's words, and from his own\r\nobservation, he knew that it was a desert island, and that if he wished\r\nto escape he would have to rely altogether upon his own resources.\r\n\r\nWith this conclusion he once more turned his attention to his\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nNearest to him was Cape d'Or, about four miles away, and Cape Split,\r\nwhich was some distance farther.  Then there was the Nova Scotia shore,\r\nwhich appeared to be seven or eight miles distant. On the beach and\r\nwithin sight was the boat which offered a sure and easy mode of passing\r\nover to the main land.  But no sooner did he recognize this fact than a\r\ndifficulty arose.  How was he to make the passage?  The boat had come\r\nashore at high tide, and was close up to the grassy bank.  The tide was\r\nfar down, and between the boat and the water was a broad beach, covered\r\nwith cobblestones, and interspersed with granite boulders.  It was too\r\nheavy a weight for him to move any distance, and to force it down to\r\nthe water over such a beach was plainly impossible.  On the other hand,\r\nhe might wait until the boat floated at high tide, and then embark.\r\nBut this, again, would be attended with serious difficulties.  The\r\ntide, he saw, would turn as soon as he should get fairly afloat, and\r\nthen he would have to contend with the downward current.  True, he\r\nmight use his sail, and in that case he might gain the Nova Scotia\r\nshore; but his experience of the tides had been so terrible a one, that\r\nhe dreaded the tremendous drift which he would have to encounter, and\r\nhad no confidence in his power of navigating under such circumstances.\r\nBesides, he knew well that although the wind was now from the north, it\r\nwas liable to change at any moment; so that even if he should be able\r\nto guide his boat, he might yet be suddenly enveloped by a fog when but\r\nhalf way over, and exposed once more to all those perils from which he\r\nhad just escaped.  The more he thought of all these dangers, the more\r\ndeterred he felt from making any such attempt.  Rather would he wait,\r\nand hope for escape in some other way.\r\n\r\nBut, as yet, he did not feel himself forced to anything so desperate as\r\nthat.  There was another alternative.  At high tide the boat would be\r\nafloat, and then, as the tide fell, he could keep her afloat until it\r\nwas at its lowest.  He could then embark, and be carried by the\r\nreturning water straight on to the Straits of Minas, and up into the\r\nbasin.  He now made a calculation, and concluded that it would be high\r\ntide about midday, and low tide about six in the evening.  If he were\r\nto embark at that time, he would have two hours of daylight in which to\r\nrun up with the tide. He saw now that his whole plan was perfectly\r\nfeasible, and it only remained to make preparations for the voyage.  As\r\nthe whole afternoon would be taken up in floating the boat down to\r\nlow-water mark, the morning would have to be employed in making\r\nwhatever arrangements might be necessary.\r\n\r\nCertain things were needed which required all that time.  His hastily\r\nextemporized mast and sail had done wonderfully well, but he needed\r\nsomething to steer with.  If he could only procure something that would\r\nserve the purpose of a rudder, he would feel well prepared for his\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nOn the search for this he now started.  He walked all about the open\r\nground, looking around in all directions, to see if he could find\r\nanything, but without any success.  Then he ascended the declivity\r\ntowards the woods, but nothing appeared which was at all adapted to\r\nmeet his wants.  He saw a young tree, which he thought might do, and\r\ntried to cut it down with his pocket-knife.  After about an hour's hard\r\nwork he succeeded in bringing it down, and another hour was spent in\r\ntrimming the branches.  The result of all this labor at length lay at\r\nhis feet in the shape of a rough pole, with jagged splinters sticking\r\nout all over it, which promised to be of about as much utility as a\r\nspruce bush.  In utter disgust he turned away, leaving the pole on the\r\nground, and making up his mind to sail, as he did before, without any\r\nrudder.  In this mood he descended the declivity, and walked\r\ndisconsolately towards the shore which was on the side of the island\r\ndirectly opposite to where the boat lay.  He had not yet been near\r\nenough to see the beach; but now, as he came nearer, a cry of delight\r\nescaped him involuntarily; for there, all along the beach, and close up\r\nto the bank, lay an immense quantity of drift-wood, which had been\r\nbrought here by the tide from all the upper waters of the bay.  It was\r\na most heterogeneous mixture that lay before him--chips from timber\r\nponds, logs from ship-yards, boards from saw-mills, deals, battens,\r\nfence posts, telegraph poles, deal ends, edgings, laths, palings,\r\nrailway sleepers, treenails, shingles, clapboards, and all the various\r\nforms which wood assumes in a country which makes use of it as the\r\nchief material of its manufactures.  Along the countless streams that\r\nflow into the bay, and along its far-winding shores, and along the\r\nborders of all its subsidiary bays, and inlets, and basins, the\r\nmanufacture of wood is carried on--in saw-mills, in ship-yards, and in\r\ntimber ponds; and the currents that move to and fro are always loaded\r\nwith the fragments that are snatched away from these places, most of\r\nwhich are borne afar out to sea, but many of which are thrown all along\r\nthe shores for hundreds of miles.  Ile Haute, being directly in the way\r\nof some of the swiftest currents, and close by the entrance to a basin\r\nwhich is surrounded by mills and ship-yards, naturally received upon\r\nits shores an immense quantity of these scattered and floating\r\nfragments.  Such was the sight that now met the eyes of Tom, and\r\npresented him with a countless number of fragments of wood adapted to\r\nhis wants, at the very time when he had worked fruitlessly for two\r\nhours at fashioning one for himself.\r\n\r\nLooking over the heaps of drift-wood, he found many pieces which suited\r\nhim; and out of these he chose one which was shaped a little like an\r\noar.  Securing this prize, he walked over to where the sail was, and\r\ndeposited it there.\r\n\r\nThen he ate some biscuit, and, after taking a draught from the cool\r\nbrook, he rested, and waited, full of hope, for the rising of the tide.\r\n\r\nIt was now rapidly approaching the boat.  Tom watched it for some time,\r\nand felt new happiness as he viewed the roll of every little surf.\r\nThere was not much wind, and nothing but a gentle ripple on the water.\r\nAll this was in his favor; for, if he wished for anything now, it was a\r\nmoderate breeze and a light sea.  From time to time he turned his\r\nattention to the Straits of Minas, and arranged various plans in his\r\nmind.  At one time he resolved to try and reach Pereau; again he\r\nthought that he would be content if he could only get to Parrsboro';\r\nand yet again, he came to the wise conclusion that if he got to any\r\nsettlement at all he would be content.  At another time he half decided\r\nto take another course, and try to reach Scott's Bay, where he felt\r\nsure of a warm welcome and a plenteous repast.  Aiming thus at so many\r\ndifferent points, it mattered but little to him in what particular\r\ndirection the tide might sweep him, so long as it carried him up the\r\nbay.\r\n\r\nThe tide now came nearer, and Tom went down to the beach for a few\r\nmoments.  He paced the distance between the boat and the water.  He\r\nnoticed a few things lying in the boat.  In the bow was a coil of rope\r\nwhich Captain Corbet had probably obtained when he was ashore at\r\nPetitcodiac.  There was also a tin pan, used for baling.\r\n\r\nAs the tide drew nearer, Tom began to feel more and more impatient.\r\nAgain and again he paced the intervening space between the boat and the\r\nwater, and chafed and fretted because it did not lessen more rapidly.\r\nIf the boat were once fairly afloat, he felt that the time would pass\r\nmuch more rapidly; for then he would be working at some definite task,\r\nand not standing idly waiting.\r\n\r\nBut everything has an end; and so, at length, the end came here. The\r\nwater rose higher and higher, until, at length, it touched the keel.\r\nTom gave a shout of joy.\r\n\r\nHe now untied the rope, and tried to shorten his suspense by pushing\r\nthe boat towards the water; but his strength was insufficient.  He\r\ncould not move it.  He would have to wait longer.\r\n\r\nThus far the things which he had taken out had been lying on the grass.\r\nIt was now time to put them on board.  So he carried down the sail,\r\nfolded it up, and stowed it away neatly at the bottom of the boat.  On\r\nthis he stood the box of biscuit, taking care to put the cover over it,\r\nand to spread over that again one fold of the sail.\r\n\r\nThis took up some time, and he had the gratification of seeing that the\r\nwater had come up a few feet farther.  He now tried once more to force\r\nthe boat down, using his piece of board as a lever; but the board bent,\r\nand almost broke, without moving the boat.  He stood for a moment\r\nwaiting, and suddenly thought of the pole which he had left up in the\r\nwoods.  He determined to get this, and perhaps, with its help, he would\r\nbe able to accomplish his wishes. So off he started at a run, and in a\r\nfew minutes reached the place. Hurrying back again, he inserted one end\r\nof the pole under the bow, and exerted all his force to press the boat\r\ndownward into the water.  At first it did not move; but shortly after,\r\nwhen the water had risen still higher, he made a new effort.  This time\r\nhe succeeded; the boat moved slightly.\r\n\r\nAgain.\r\n\r\nThe boat moved farther.\r\n\r\nOnce more.\r\n\r\nStill farther.\r\n\r\nAnd now he made a final trial.  Thrusting the pole again underneath, he\r\nexerted all his force for the last time, and pushed the boat down for\r\nabout a yard.\r\n\r\nIt was at last afloat.\r\n\r\nThe tide had not yet fully attained its height, but was close to it.\r\nThe wind was blowing from the north, as before, and quite moderately.\r\nThe sea sparkled and glittered in the rays of the sun. The little\r\nwavelets tossed their heads on high, and danced far away ever the sea.\r\nThe air was bright, and stimulating, and exhilarating.  All the scene\r\nfilled Tom's heart with gladness; and the approach of his deliverance\r\ndeepened and intensified this feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nAfloat again.--The rushing Water.--Down to the Bottom.--Desperate\r\nCircumstances.--Can they be remedied?--New Hopes and Plans.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boat was at last afloat before Tom's eyes.\r\n\r\nAt first he had thought of holding it by the painter, and patiently\r\nstanding on the beach, but the sight of it now changed his purposes.\r\nHe thought that it would be a far more sensible plan to get on board,\r\nand keep the boat near the beach in that way.  His bit of stick, which\r\nhe had found among the drift-wood, could be used as an oar, and was\r\ngood enough to enable him to move the boat as much as would be\r\nnecessary.  As he would have to wait for six hours at least, it was a\r\nmatter of great importance that he should be as little fatigued as\r\npossible, especially as he had to look forward to a voyage, after the\r\ntide had fallen, attended with the possibility of increased labor and\r\nexertion.  All these thoughts came rapidly to his mind, but passed in\r\nmuch less time than it takes to tell it, so that Tom had scarcely seen\r\nthe boat afloat than he rushed through the water, and clambered into\r\nit.  Then, taking his stick, he stood up and looked around.\r\n\r\nThe scene around has already been described.  Tom kept his stick in the\r\nwater, so as to have it ready for use.  He purposed keeping the boat at\r\na convenient distance from the shore by pushing and paddling.  By\r\nkeeping it within a distance of from three to six yards, he thought he\r\nwould, for the present at least, be able to keep afloat, and yet avoid\r\nthe sweep of the tides.  He did not expect to remain in this particular\r\nspot all the time, but expected to find some place which would be out\r\nof the way of the tide, where he could float comfortably without being\r\nforced to keep in too close to the land.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly Tom's thoughts and speculations were rudely interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to him that there was a very unusual feeling about the\r\nboat.  She did not seem as high out of the water as she ought to have\r\nbeen, and her bows seemed to be lower than they had been. There was\r\nalso a slight vibration in her, which he had never noticed before, and\r\nwhich struck him now as very peculiar.  In the midst of this there came\r\nto his ears a low, faint, and scarcely perceptible sound, made up of\r\npeculiar bubbling and gurgling noises, which sounded from the boat.\r\n\r\nOne brief examination showed him that the boat was certainly very much\r\ndeeper in the water than she had been.\r\n\r\nFive seconds later her bows had sunk farther.\r\n\r\nTwo seconds more, and Tom's feet were surrounded by water up to his\r\nankles.\r\n\r\nThe boat was filling!\r\n\r\nScarce had he made this discovery than the water rose swiftly up, the\r\nboat sank quickly down, the sea rolled over her sides, and the boat\r\nwent to the bottom.\r\n\r\nVery fortunate was it for Tom, at that moment, that he had not pushed\r\nout farther from the shore.  When the boat went down he was not more\r\nthan three or four yards off, and he did not sink lower than up to his\r\nneck.  But the shock was a sudden one, and for a moment almost\r\nparalyzed him.  The next instant, however, he recovered from it; and\r\nlooking round, he saw the box of biscuit floating within his reach.\r\nMaking a wild dash at this, he secured it, and waded ashore with it in\r\nsafety.  He then turned mournfully to look after the boat, and found\r\nthat it was visible, floating on the surface.  As he left it, it had\r\nfloated up, his weight being the only thing that had sent it below.\r\nThe tide was still coming in, so that it did not float away.  Tom flung\r\noff his coat and waistcoat, and hurrying into the water, soon caught\r\nand dragged it as near as he could to the beach.  Then he secured it\r\nonce more, and waited.  Standing there, he looked gloomily at the\r\nvessel, wherein such precious hopes had been freighted only to be lost.\r\nWhat had happened?  Why could not the boat float?  What was the matter\r\nwith her?  These were the wondering questions which occurred to him\r\nwithout his being able to give any answer.\r\n\r\nOne thing he saw plainly, and that was, that he had lost this tide. The\r\nnext high tide would be after midnight, and the next would be between\r\none and two on the following day.  If he could find out what was the\r\nmatter with the boat, and fix it, he would have to wait till the next\r\nday, unless he chose to watch for his chance after midnight, and make\r\nthe journey then.\r\n\r\nHe was not a boy who could be long inactive; so now, after a brief\r\nperiod, in which he gave up to the natural despondency of his soul, he\r\nstirred himself up once more, and sought comfort in occupation. The box\r\nof biscuit did not seem much injured, it had not floated long enough\r\nfor the sea-water to penetrate it.  Assuring himself of this, he next\r\nturned to the boat and took out its contents.  These were the old sail,\r\nthe coil of rope, and the baling dipper.\r\n\r\nBy this time the tide had reached its height, and after the usual time\r\nof delay, began to fall once more.  The boat was secured to the shore,\r\nand after a time the water began to leave her.  Tom sat at a little\r\ndistance, wondering what could be the matter with her, and deferring\r\nhis examination until the boat should be left aground.  It was a\r\nmystery to him how this sudden change had occurred, and why the boat,\r\nwhich had floated so well during his long drift, should now, all of a\r\nsudden, begin to leak with such astonishing rapidity.  Something must\r\nhave happened--something serious, too; but what it was, or how it had\r\nhappened, he could not, for the life of him, conjecture.\r\n\r\nAs Tom sat there, the tide gradually left the boat; and as the tide\r\nleft, the water ran out, keeping at just the same level inside as the\r\nwater outside.  This showed, even to his inexperienced eyes, that the\r\nleak must be a very large one, since it admitted of such a ready flow\r\nof water in and out.  The water descended lower and lower as he sat,\r\nuntil, at last, the boat was left by the retreating waves.  The water\r\nhad all run out.\r\n\r\nTom now advanced, and proceeded to examine her.  When he was arranging\r\nher cargo before, the coil of rope had been in the bows. This had\r\nprevented him from detecting anything wrong in the boat. But now, since\r\neverything had been taken out, one glance only was quite sufficient to\r\nmake known to him instantly the whole difficulty.  There, in the bows,\r\nunderneath the very place where the coil of rope had lain, was a huge\r\naperture.  The planks had been beaten in, and one side of the bow was\r\ndestroyed beyond hope of remedy.\r\n\r\nThe sight of such an irremediable calamity as this renewed for a time\r\nthe despondency which he had felt at the first sinking of the boat.\r\nFull of depression, he turned away, and tried to account for it all.\r\nIt was on the previous day that he had landed--about twenty-four hours\r\nago.  How had he passed the time since then, and what had happened?\r\nThis he tried to remember.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, up to the moment of landing the boat was perfectly\r\nsound, and far from all injury.  It had not been hurt during the drift.\r\nIt had struck at one place, but the long voyage that had followed\r\nshowed that no damage had resulted.  Finally, it had not been harmed by\r\nlanding on Quaco Ledge.  Since that time he had drifted in safety far\r\nacross the bay, without meeting with any accident.  All this proved\r\nclearly that the damage must have been done to the boat since his\r\nlanding on the island.\r\n\r\nHe found it very difficult to recall anything that had happened since\r\nthen.  On his first arrival he was worn out and exhausted. He\r\nremembered vaguely how he came in sight of the giant cliff, how he\r\ndragged the boat along, how he secured it to a tree, and then how he\r\nflung himself down on the grass and fell asleep.  After that all was\r\nobscure to his memory; but he could recall his waking at midnight and\r\nlistening to the roar of the wind and the dash of the surf.  Evidently\r\nthere must have been a heavier sea on the beach at that time than when\r\nhe landed, and this was sufficient to account for the accident to the\r\nboat.  She had been beating on the rough rocks at high tide, exposed to\r\nthe full sweep of the surf, and her bows had been stove in.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy spectacle of the ruined boat made Tom see that his stay\r\non the island might be prolonged even beyond the following day.  No\r\nsooner had this thought occurred to him than he went over to the\r\narticles which he had taken out of the boat, and passed them all in\r\nreview before him, as though he were anxious to know the full extent of\r\nhis resources.  He spread out the wet sail in the sun.  He spread out\r\nhis coat and waistcoat.  In the pocket of the latter he found a card of\r\nmatches, which were a little damp.  These he seized eagerly and laid on\r\nthe top of a stone, exposed to the rays of the sun, so as to dry them.\r\nThe clothes which he kept on were wet through, of course, but he\r\nallowed them to dry on him.\r\n\r\nHe had been working now pretty industriously all the morning, first at\r\nsearching after a piece of wood, then in cutting down the pole, then in\r\nsearching among the drift-wood, and finally at the boat. He felt, at\r\nlength, hungry; and as he could not yet decide upon what was to be done\r\nnext, he determined to satisfy his desires, and kill the time by taking\r\nhis dinner.  The repast was a frugal one, consisting as before, of\r\nbiscuit, which were washed down by cold water; but Tom did not\r\ncomplain.  The presence of food of any sort was a cause for\r\nthankfulness to one in his position, and it was with a feeling of this\r\nsort, in spite of his general depression of spirits, that he ate his\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nAfter this he felt much more refreshed, and began to consider what he\r\nhad better do next.  Of course, the centre of interest to him was the\r\nboat, and he could not give up that hope of escape without a struggle.\r\nAs long as there was a hope of making his way from the island by means\r\nof that, so long might he keep up his heart; but if the damage that had\r\nbeen done should prove irreparable, how would he be able to endure his\r\nsituation?  Whatever it was, it would be best to know the worst once\r\nfor all.  Perhaps he might stop the leak.  He had material around which\r\nseemed to be the right sort of thing to stop a leak with.  He had the\r\npiece of sail, which could be cut up into small pieces, and used to\r\nstop the leak.  If he had possessed a hatchet and some nails, he would\r\nhave made an effort to repair the fracture in the planks of the boat;\r\nbut as he had nothing of that sort, he tried to devise some method by\r\nwhich the water might be kept out.  As he thought, there gradually grew\r\nup in his mind the rude outline of a plan which promised something, and\r\nseemed to him to be certainly worth trying.  At any rate, he thought,\r\nit will serve to give me an occupation; and any occupation, even if it\r\nproves to be of no practical value, is better than sitting here doing\r\nnothing at all.\r\n\r\nHaving something to do once more quickened Tom's energies anew, and\r\nstarting to his feet, he prepared to put his plan into execution. First\r\nof all, in order to carry out that plan, it was necessary for him to\r\nget a number of blocks and boards of different sizes. These, he knew,\r\ncould easily be found among the driftwood on the beach.  Over there he\r\nhurried, and after a moderate search he succeeded, at length, in\r\nfinding bits of wood that seemed suited to the purpose which he had in\r\nview.  With these he came back to the boat; but as there was a large\r\nnumber of them, he had to make several journeys before the whole\r\ncollection was brought over.\r\n\r\nThen he took his pole, and, putting a block under it, used it as a\r\nlever to raise up the boat.  By dexterous management he succeeded in\r\ndoing this, and at the same time he ran a board underneath the bow of\r\nthe boat as it was slightly raised.  This manoeuvre he repeated several\r\ntimes, each time raising his lever higher, by means of a higher\r\nfulcrum, and thus constantly raising the bow of the boat; while after\r\neach elevation the bow was secured in its new position by running an\r\nadditional board underneath it, over the other preceding boards.  By\r\ncarefully and perseveringly pursuing this course, he at length\r\nsucceeded in raising the bow of the boat about a foot in the air.  This\r\ngave him an opportunity to examine it thoroughly outside as well as\r\ninside, and to see the whole extent of the damage that had been done.\r\n\r\nIt has already been said that the damage was serious.  Tom's\r\nexamination now convinced him that it was in every respect as serious\r\nas he had supposed, if not still more so.  Even if he did possess a\r\nhatchet and nails, or a whole box full of tools, he doubted whether it\r\nwould be in his power to do anything whatever in the way of repairing\r\nit.  No less than three of the lower planks of the bows, down to the\r\nvery keel, were beaten in and broken so badly that they seemed actually\r\ncrushed and mangled.  It must have been a fearful beating, and\r\npounding, and grinding on the rocks which had caused this.  The planks,\r\nthough thus broken, still held together; but it seemed to Tom that with\r\na blow of his fist he could easily beat it all in; and as he looked at\r\nit he could not help wondering how it had happened that the work which\r\nthe rocks had thus so nearly effected had not been completely finished.\r\nHowever, the planks did hold together yet; and now the question was,\r\nCould any thing be done?\r\n\r\nIn answer to this question, Tom thought of the old sail and the coil of\r\nrope.  Already he had conceived the rude outline of a plan whereby the\r\nentrance of the water might be checked.  The plan was worth trying, and\r\nhe determined to set about it at once, and use up the hours before him\r\nas long as he could, without any further delay. If by any possibility\r\nhe could stop that leak, he determined to start off at the next high\r\ntide, that very night, and run the risk. It was a daring, even a\r\nfoolhardy thought; but Tom was desperate, and the only idea which he\r\nhad was, to escape as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nHe now made some measurements, after which he went to the old sail, and\r\ncut a piece from the end of it.  This he divided into smaller pieces,\r\neach about a yard square.  Each of these pieces he folded up in three\r\nfolds, so as to make them about a foot wide and eighteen inches long.\r\nOthers he folded into six folds, making them about half the size of the\r\nlarger pieces.  All this took up much time, for he measured and planned\r\nvery carefully, and his calculations and measurements had to be done\r\nslowly and cautiously. Returning to the boat with these bits of folded\r\ncanvas, he put one of the larger pieces on the inside, against the bow,\r\nright over the broken place.  Another large piece was placed carefully\r\nover this, and then the smaller pieces were laid against these.  In\r\nthis way he adjusted all the pieces of canvas in such a way as to cover\r\nup the whole place where the leak was.\r\n\r\nThen he went over to the drift-wood, and spent a long time searching\r\nafter some bits of wood.  He at length found a half dozen pieces of\r\nboard, about a foot long, and from six to eight inches in width.  He\r\nalso found some bits of scantling, and palings, which were only a foot\r\nor so in length.  All these he brought back, and laid them down on the\r\nbeach near the boat.\r\n\r\nHe now proceeded to place these bits of wood in the bows, in such a way\r\nas to keep the canvas in a firm position.  His idea was, that the\r\ncanvas, by being pressed against the opening, might keep out the water,\r\nand the wood, by being properly arranged, might keep the canvas secure\r\nin its place.  The arrangement of the wood required the greatest care.\r\nFirst of all, he took the smallest bits, and stood these up against the\r\ncanvas, so that they might correspond as nearly as possible with the\r\ncurve of the bows.  A few more pieces were placed in the hollow part of\r\nthis curve, and outside these the larger pieces were placed.  Between\r\nthe outside pieces and the inner ones he thrust some of the smallest\r\npieces which he could find.  After thus arranging all his boards, he\r\nfound that there lay between the outside board and the first seat of\r\nthe boat a space of about one foot.  Selecting a piece of wood of about\r\nthat length, he put one end against the board, and the other against\r\nthe seat, and pressed it into a position where it served to keep the\r\nboard tight in its place.  Then he took other pieces of about the same\r\nlength, and arranged them in the same way, so that, by being fixed\r\nbetween the board and the seat, they might keep the whole mass of\r\nboards and canvas pressed tight against the opening in the bows.  After\r\nplacing as many blocks in position as he conveniently could, his next\r\nwork was to secure them all.  In order to effect this, another journey\r\nto the drift-wood was necessary, and another search.  This time he\r\nselected carefully a number of sticks, not more than half an inch in\r\nthickness, some of them being much thinner.  He found pieces of paling,\r\nand laths, and shingles which suited his ideas. Returning with these to\r\nthe boat, he proceeded to thrust them, one by one, into the interstices\r\nof the boards, using a stone to drive them into their places.\r\n\r\nAt last the work was finished as far as he could accomplish it, and\r\nthere remained nothing more to be done.  As far as he could see, by\r\nshaking, and pulling, and pushing at the collection of sticks and\r\ncanvas, it was very firm and secure.  Every stick seemed to be tight,\r\nand the pressure which they maintained against the aperture was so\r\nstrong that the wood-work now was forced out a little distance beyond\r\nthe outline of the boat.  He examined most carefully all about the bows\r\non the outside, but saw no place which did not seem to be fully\r\nprotected.  It seemed to him now as though that piled-up canvas ought\r\nto resist the entrance of the water, or, if not, at least that it ought\r\nnot to allow it to enter so rapidly but that he could easily keep the\r\nboat baled out.\r\n\r\nHe was not altogether confident, yet he was hopeful, and as determined\r\nas ever to make a trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nWaiting for high Water.--A Trial.--A new Discovery.--Total\r\nFailure.--Down again.--Overboard.--A Struggle for Life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom's work was thus, at length, accomplished, and it remained now to\r\nget the boat in readiness and wait.  Slowly and carefully he raised the\r\nbow by means of the lever, and one by one he withdrew the boards which\r\nheld it up.  At last the boat lay on the beach, ready to receive the\r\nuplifting arms of the returning tide whenever it should make its\r\nappearance again.  Tom saw with satisfaction that the boat was about\r\nthree yards down below high-water mark, on the spot to which he had\r\ndragged it after the failure of his last experiment.  This, of course,\r\nwould be so much in his favor, for it would thus be able to float\r\nbefore the water should reach its height.\r\n\r\nHe had worked hard all the afternoon, and it was already dark.  The\r\ntide, which had been falling, had some time ago reached its lowest\r\npoint, and was now returning.  Between him and the lowest point was a\r\ngreat distance, for the tides here rise to a perpendicular height of\r\nover forty feet; but Tom knew that the time required to traverse the\r\nlong space that here intervened between high and low-water mark was\r\nprecisely the same as if it had only to rise a few feet.\r\n\r\nHe was very hungry, but some things had yet to be done.  He had to put\r\non board the boat the articles that he had taken ashore.  His matches\r\nwere now quite dry, and he put them in his pocket with a deep sense of\r\ntheir value to him in his present position.  His clothes also were dry,\r\nand these he put on.  The sail, the coil of rope, and the box of\r\nbiscuit were put on board the boat.  Tom had still to make his frugal\r\nrepast; but this was soon accomplished, and he felt again a sense of\r\nexceeding thankfulness at the possession of the box of biscuit.  At\r\nlength his evening meal was over, and by the time that he had finished\r\nit, it had grown quite dark.  He now went to the boat, and tied up the\r\nsail around the mast.  There was nothing to which he could fasten the\r\nboat; but it was not necessary, as he was on the watch.  The water\r\ncontinued smooth, the wind was from the north, as before, and there was\r\nno sign of fog.  Overhead the sky was free from clouds, and the stars\r\ntwinkled pleasantly to his upturned eyes, as if to encourage him. There\r\nwas no moon, however, and though it was not very dark, yet it was\r\nsufficiently so to veil the nearest shores in gloom, and finally to\r\nwithdraw them altogether from his view.  Still it was not a matter of\r\nnecessity that he should see the opposite shores, for he knew that his\r\nchief, and indeed his only reliance must be upon the tide; and this\r\nwould bear him in its upward course on the morrow.  The night was only\r\nneeded to float the boat down as far as low-water mark.  The process of\r\nfloating her would serve to test the security of the fastenings, and\r\nshow whether he could venture to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nFor hours Tom waited, sometimes seated in the boat, at other times\r\nwalking along the beach down to the water.  He found it difficult to\r\nkeep himself awake, and therefore did not venture to sit down long.\r\nWearied with his long work through the day, the necessity of constant\r\nexertion wearied him still more, until at length he could scarce draw\r\nhis legs after him.  But all things have an end, and so it was with\r\nTom's dreary watch; for at length the waters came up, and touched the\r\nboat, and surrounded it, until at last, to his great joy, Tom found\r\nhimself afloat.  He seized his stick, and pushed the boat into deeper\r\nwater, a few yards off, with the intention of keeping her at about that\r\ndistance from the shore.\r\n\r\nThe one thought that was now in his mind referred exclusively to his\r\nwork in the boat.  Was it firm?  Would it hold?  Did it leak? The boat\r\nwas floating, certainly.  How long would if continue to do so?  For a\r\nfew minutes he waited anxiously, as he floated there in deep water,\r\nwith his eyes fixed on the work in the bow, and his ears listening\r\nintently to detect any sign of that warning, gurgling sound, which had\r\nstruck terror to his heart on his last embarkation.  But no sign came\r\nof any sound of that sort, and he heard nothing but the gentle dash of\r\nthe water against the sides of the boat.  Thus about five minutes\r\npassed.  At the end of that time, he raised the sail, which he had laid\r\nalong the bottom of the boat, and examined underneath it.  The first\r\ntouch of his fingers at the bottom lessened very largely the hope that\r\nwas in him, and at once chased away the feeling of exultation that was\r\nrising.  For there, in the bottom of the boat, he felt as much as an\r\ninch of water.  After the first shock, he tried to believe that it was\r\nonly the water that was in the boat before; and so, taking comfort in\r\nthis thought, he waited for further developments, but at the same time\r\ntook the dipper, so as to be ready to bale out the water, and have a\r\nstruggle for it in case the worst should happen.\r\n\r\nAnother minute assured him that this was not the water which had been\r\nin the boat before.  A new supply was entering, and in the space of\r\nthat short time of waiting it had risen to the height of another inch.\r\nTom felt a sudden pang of dismay, but his stout heart did not quail,\r\nnor did his obstinate resolution falter. Since it was the sea water\r\nthat was coming in, he determined to have a fight with it for the\r\npossession of the boat.  So he set to work bravely, and began to bale.\r\nHe pulled up the sail, so as to have plenty of elbow-room, and worked\r\naway, dipping out the water; but, as he dipped, he perceived that it\r\nwas gradually getting deeper.  He dipped faster, but without any\r\nvisible improvement, indeed, his efforts seemed to have but very little\r\neffect in retarding the entrance of the water.  It grew deeper and\r\ndeeper. One inch of water soon deepened to two inches, and thence to\r\nthree. Soon after four inches were felt.\r\n\r\nAnd now the water came in more rapidly.  It seemed to Tom as though it\r\nhad been delayed at first, for a little time, in finding an entrance,\r\nbut that now, after the entrance was found, it came pouring in with\r\never-accelerated speed.  Tom struggled on, hoping against hope, and\r\nkeeping up his efforts long after they were proved to be useless.  But\r\nthe water came in faster and faster, until at length Tom began to see\r\nthat he must seek his safety in another way.  Flinging down his dipper,\r\nthen, with a cry of vexation, he started up, and, seizing his bit of\r\nboard, he looked around for the shore.\r\n\r\nHe had been caught by some side current, and had been carried along in\r\nsuch a way that he was about a hundred yards from the island, and\r\nseemed to be drifting up the bay.  The dark, shadowy shores were much\r\nfarther away than he had suspected.  While struggling to bale out the\r\nboat, he had forgotten how necessary it was to keep near to the shore.\r\nHe now saw his mistake, and strove to paddle the boat back again.  With\r\nsuch a clumsy oar it is not likely that he could have achieved his\r\ndesire at all, had the flood tide been stronger; but now it was about\r\nat its height, and would soon turn, if it was not turning already.  The\r\ncurrent, therefore, was but a weak one, and Tom found himself able to\r\nmove slowly back; but his progress was very slow, and working at such a\r\ndisadvantage was excessively fatiguing.  At last he saw that if he\r\ntrusted to paddling he could never reach the shore.  In a moment\r\nanother idea suggested itself; there was no time to lose, and he at\r\nonce acted on it.  Darting forward, he loosed the sail.  The wind was\r\nstill blowing from the north; at once the sail was filled, and,\r\nyielding to this new power, the boat began to move more rapidly.  Tom\r\ntied the sheet astern, and, seizing his paddle, tried to scull the\r\nboat. For some minutes he kept up this work, and the boat moved\r\nsteadily forward, nearer and still nearer, until the land was at length\r\nnot more than thirty or forty yards off.\r\n\r\nBut by this time the danger had come nearer, and the boat was already\r\nhalf full of water.  Tom began to see that it could not float as far as\r\nthe shore.  What was he to do?  He waited a little longer.  He looked\r\naround.  The boat was drawing nearer, yet soon it must go down.  To\r\nease it, it would be necessary to relieve it of his own weight.  He did\r\nnot lose his presence of mind for a moment, but determined at once to\r\njump overboard.  In his perfect coolness he thought of one or two\r\nthings which were of importance to him, and performed them swiftly and\r\npromptly.  First he took the box of biscuit, and placed it on the heap\r\nof boards and canvas in the bows, so that it might remain as long as\r\npossible out of reach of the water.  Then he took the card of matches\r\nout of his waistcoat pocket, and put them in his hat, which he replaced\r\non his head.  To secure thus from damage the two necessaries of food\r\nand fire was but the work of a few seconds.  To throw off his coat,\r\nwaistcoat, and trousers, and hang them over the top of the short mast,\r\nwas the work of a few seconds more.  By the time this had been done,\r\nthe water was nearly up to the gunwales.  In five seconds more the boat\r\nwould have gone down; but, so well had Tom's work been done, and so\r\npromptly, that these five seconds were saved.  Having done what he\r\nwished, he let himself down into the water; and, holding on by the\r\nstern of the boat, he allowed himself to float after it, kicking out at\r\nthe same time, so as to assist, rather than retard, its progress.\r\n\r\nBy this time the land was not more than twenty yards away.  The boat\r\ndid not sink so rapidly now, but kept afloat much better; still the\r\nwater rose to a level with the gunwales, and Tom was too much rejoiced\r\nto find that it kept afloat at all to find fault with this.  The wind\r\nstill blew, and the sail was still up; so that the water-logged vessel\r\nwent on at a very respectable rate, until at length half the distance\r\nwhich Tom had noticed on going overboard was traversed.  The boat\r\nseemed to float now, though full of water, and Tom saw that his\r\nprecious biscuit, at any rate, would not be very much harmed.  Nearer\r\nand nearer now he came until at last, letting himself down, his feet\r\ntouched bottom.  A cry of delight escaped him; and now, bracing himself\r\nfirmly against the solid land below, he urged the boat on faster, until\r\nat length her deep-sunk bows grated against the gravel of the beach.\r\n\r\nHe hurried up to the box of biscuit, and put this ashore in a safe\r\nplace; after which he secured the boat to a jagged rock on the bank.\r\nHe found now that he had come to a different part of the beach\r\naltogether, for his boat was lying at the spot where the little brook\r\nran into the sea.  Well was it for him, in that rash and hazardous\r\nexperiment, that he had floated off before the tide was high.  It had\r\nled to his drifting up the bay, instead of down, and by a weak current,\r\ninstead of a strong one.  The wind had thus brought him back.  Had it\r\nbeen full tide, he would have drifted out from the shore, and then have\r\nbeen carried down the bay by the falling water to swift and sure\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nTom now took off his wet shirt, and put on the dry clothes which he had\r\nso prudently hung on the top of the mast.  He perceived that he had not\r\na very pleasant lookout for the night, for the sail which he had\r\nformerly used to envelop himself with was now completely saturated.  It\r\nwas also too dark to go to the woods in search of ferns or mosses on\r\nwhich to sleep.  However, the night was a pleasant one, and the grass\r\naround would not be so bad a resting-place as he had been forced to use\r\nwhile drifting in the boat.  He had now become accustomed to hardship\r\nby bitter experience, and so he looked forward to the night without\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThe day had been an eventful one, indeed, for him, and his last\r\nadventure had been full of peril, from which he had been most\r\nwonderfully rescued.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were in his mind, and he did not fail to offer up\r\nprayers of heartfelt gratitude to that good and merciful Being who had\r\nthus far so wonderfully preserved him.  With such feelings in his\r\nheart, he sought out a sleeping-place, and after some search he found a\r\nmossy knoll.  Seating himself here, he reclined his back against it,\r\nand in a few minutes the worn-out boy was buried in a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nHe slept until late on the following day, and on waking looked around\r\nto see if there were any sails in view.  None were visible. The tide\r\nwas about half way up, and the wide waters spread before him without\r\nany vessel in sight.  He then began his preparations for the day.  He\r\nhung his shirt upon a bush, and spread out the wet sail on the grass.\r\nAn examination of the biscuit showed him that they had scarcely been\r\ninjured at all, the water having penetrated only the lower part of the\r\nbox.  He removed the lower layer of biscuit, and spread them out on a\r\nrock in the sun to dry.  After this he breakfasted, and wandered about\r\nfor a time.  He then took a swim, and felt much refreshed.  By the time\r\nthat his swim was over, he found that the hot sun had dried his shirt,\r\nso that he could once more assume that very important article of\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nThe sun climbed high towards the zenith, and the tide came up higher,\r\nas Tom sat there alone on his desert island, looking out upon the sea.\r\nThe boat from which he had hoped so much had proved false to those\r\nhopes, and all the labors of the previous day had proved useless.  His\r\nattempt to escape had nearly resulted in his destruction.  He had\r\nlearned from that experiment that no efforts of his could now effect\r\nhis rescue.  He had done the very best he could, and it would not be\r\npossible for him, with his present resources, to contrive anything\r\nbetter than that which had so miserably failed.  If he could only\r\nprocure some tar, he might then stop up the interstices; but as it was,\r\nnothing of his construction would avail to keep back the treacherous\r\nentrance of the water.  It seemed now to him that his stay on the\r\nisland was destined to be prolonged to a much greater extent than he\r\nhad first thought of, and there did not seem any longer a hope of\r\nsaving himself by his own exertions.\r\n\r\nAlone on a desert island!\r\n\r\nIt was a dreadful fact which now forced itself more and more upon Tom's\r\nmind, until at length he could think of nothing else. Hitherto he had\r\nfought off the idea whenever it presented itself, and so long as he had\r\nbeen able to indulge in any hope of freeing himself by his own\r\nexertions, he prevented himself from sinking into the gloom of utter\r\ndespair.  But now he could no longer save himself from that gloom, and\r\nthe thought grew darker and drearier before him--the one fact of his\r\npresent situation.\r\n\r\nAlone on a desert island!\r\n\r\nA very interesting thing to read about, no doubt; and Tom, like all\r\nboys, had revelled in the portrayals of such a situation which he had\r\nencountered in his reading.  No one had entered with more zest than he\r\ninto the pages of Robinson Crusoe, and no one had enjoyed more than he\r\nthe talks which boys love to have about their possible doings under\r\nsuch circumstances.  But now, to be here, and find himself in such a\r\nplace,--to be brought face to face with the hard, stern, dismal\r\nfact,--was another thing altogether.  What oppressed him most was not\r\nthe hardships of his position.  These he could have withstood if there\r\nhad been nothing worse.  The worst part of his present life was its\r\nsolitude.  If Bart had been here with him, or Bruce, or Arthur, or\r\nPhil, or Pat, how different it would have been!  Even old Solomon would\r\nhave enabled him to pass the time contentedly.  But to be alone,--all\r\nalone,--without a soul to speak to,--that was terrible.\r\n\r\nTom soon found that the very way to deepen his misery was to sit still\r\nand brood over it.  He was not inclined to give way to trouble.  It has\r\nalready been seen that he was a boy of obstinate courage, resolute\r\nwill, and invincible determination.  He was capable of struggling to\r\nthe last against any adversity; and even if he had to lose, he knew how\r\nto lose without sinking into complete despair.  These moods of\r\ndepression, or even of despair, which now and then did come, were not\r\npermanent.  In time he shook them off, and looked about for some new\r\nway of carrying on the struggle with evil fortune.\r\n\r\nSo now he shook off this fit of depression, and starting up he\r\ndetermined not to sit idle any longer.\r\n\r\n\"I won't stand it,\" he muttered.  \"There's lots of things to be seen,\r\nand to be done.  And first of all I've got to explore this island.\r\nCome, Tom, my boy; cheer up, old fellow.  You've pretended to admire\r\nRobinson Crusoe; act up to your profession.  And first of all, my boy,\r\nyou've got to explore Juan Fernandez.\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of his own voice had the effect of encouraging and\r\ninspiriting him, while the purpose which he thus assigned to himself\r\nwas sufficient to awaken his prostrated energies.  There was something\r\nin the plan which roused all his curiosity, and turned his thoughts and\r\nfeelings into a totally new direction.  No sooner, then, had this\r\nthought occurred to him, than he at once set out to put it into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nFirst of all he took one parting look at the scene around him.  The sun\r\nhad now passed its meridian, and it seemed to be one o'clock or after.\r\nThe tide was high.  The boat, which had at first floated, was now\r\nnearly full of water.  Tom threw a melancholy glance at this fresh\r\nproof of the utter futility of all his labor, and then examined the\r\nfastenings, so that it might not drift away during his absence.  Then\r\nhe searched among the drift-wood until he found a stout stick to assist\r\nhim in climbing, and to serve as a companion in his walk, after which\r\nhe started.\r\n\r\nThe sun was bright, but over the sky some clouds were gathering, and\r\nthe opposite shores seemed to have grown darker than they were a few\r\nhours ago, having assumed a hue like olive green.  The wind had also\r\ndied away, and the water was as smooth as glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nWhere's Solomon?--An anxious Search.--The Beach.--The cavernous\r\nCliffs.--Up the Precipice.--Along the Shore.--Back for Boats.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loss of Solomon had filled the boys with anxiety, and even Captain\r\nCorbet shared in the common feeling.  He had preferred to set out, as\r\nhe said, with a coil of rope; but the sight of this seemed to make\r\nSolomon's fate appear darker, and looked as though he might have fallen\r\nover a precipice, or into a deep pool of water.  They all knew that a\r\nserious accident was not at all improbable.  They had seen the lofty\r\nand rugged cliffs that lined the bay shore, and knew that the rising\r\nwaters, as they dashed over them, might form the grave of a man far\r\nyounger and more active than the aged Solomon.  He was weak and\r\nrheumatic; he was also timid and easily confused.  If the water had\r\novertaken him anywhere, he might easily fall a prey.  In his efforts to\r\nescape, he would soon become so terrified that his limbs would be\r\nparalyzed.  He might then stumble over the rocks, and break some of his\r\nbones, or he might be intrapped in some recess of the cliffs, from\r\nwhich escape might be impossible without external help.\r\n\r\nFull of thoughts like these, the boys went on, with Captain Corbet, up\r\nthrough the village, looking carefully around as they went on, and\r\nmaking inquiries of every one whom they met.  No one, however, could\r\ngive them any information.  At last they reached the end of the\r\nvillage.  Here, on the left, there arose a high hill.  The road wound\r\nround this, and descended into a valley, through which a stream ran to\r\nthe bay.  In this valley there was a ship-yard, where the half-finished\r\nfabric of a large ship stood before them, and from which the rattle of\r\na hundred axes rose into the air.  The valley itself was a beautiful\r\nplace, running up among steep hills, till it was lost to view among a\r\nmass of evergreen trees and rich foliage.  Below the shipyard was a\r\ncove of no very great depth, but of extreme beauty.  Beyond this was a\r\nbroad beach, which, at the farthest end, was bounded by the projecting\r\nheadland before alluded to.  The headland was a precipitous cliff of\r\nred sandstone, crowned at the summit with a fringe of forest trees,\r\nwhite at its base were two or three hollow caverns, worn into the solid\r\nrock by the action of the surf.  One of these was about thirty feet in\r\nheight at its mouth, and ran back for sixty or seventy feet, narrowing\r\nall the way, like a funnel, from its entrance to its farthest extremity.\r\n\r\nThe tide was now nearly at its height, and progress down the beach and\r\nalong the cliff was impossible.  The caves were cut off also, and the\r\nwater penetrated them for some distance.  At low tide one could easily\r\nwalk down to the extreme point of the headland, and rounding this, he\r\nwould find it possible to go along in front of the cliffs for an\r\nimmense distance, either by walking along the rough beach at their\r\nfoot, or, if the water should rise again, by going along rocky shelves,\r\nwhich projected for miles from the surface of the cliff.\r\n\r\nReaching the head of the beach, Captain Corbet paused, and looked\r\naround.\r\n\r\n\"Before goin any further,\" said he, \"we'd better ask the folks at this\r\nship-yard.  It ain't possible to tell whether he's gone by the beach or\r\nnot.  He may have gone up the valley.\"\r\n\r\n\"O,\" said Bart, dolefully, \"he must have gone by the beach.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rayther think I'll ask, at any rate,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\nSo saying, he walked up towards a house that was not far off, and\r\naccosted some men who were standing there.  On hearing his question,\r\nthey were silent for a few moments; and at last one of them recollected\r\nseeing an aged colored man passing by early in the morning.  He had a\r\nbasket on his arm, and in every way corresponded to the description of\r\nSolomon.  He was on his way up the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Did he go down to the pint,\" asked Captain Corbet, \"or up to the top\r\nof the cliff?\"\r\n\r\nThe man couldn't say for certain; but as far as he could recollect, it\r\nseemed to him that he went down to the pint.\r\n\r\n\"About what time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Between eight and nine o'clock--in fact, about eight--not much later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he speak to any one here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he walked past without stoppin.  An do you say he ain't got back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" said the man, \"for an old feller, an a feller what don't know\r\nthe country hereabouts, he's gone on a dangerous journey; an ef he's\r\ntried to get back, he's found it a pooty hard road to travel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there any chance of his gettin back by the cliff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not with the water risin onto his path.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any way of gettin up to the top of the cliff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, fur a active young feller it wouldn't be hard, but for a pore old\r\ncritter like that thar, it couldn't be done--no how.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, boys,\" said Captain Corbet, sorrowfully, \"I guess we'd better get\r\non, an not lose any more time.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked away in silence for some time, until at last they reached\r\nthe foot of the cliff.  A path here ran up in a winding direction so as\r\nto reach the top.\r\n\r\n\"It seems too bad,\" said Captain Corbet, \"not to be able to get to the\r\nbeach.  I wish I'd come in the boat.  What a fool I was not to think of\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I dare say the top of the cliff will do,\" said Bruce.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, it'll have to do.  At any rate I've got the kile of rope.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be able to see him from the top just as well, and perhaps\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I hope so; but we'll be a leetle too far above him for my\r\nfancy,--ony we can use the rope, I s'pose.  Can any of you youngsters\r\nclimb?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes,\" said Bart, \"all of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of heads have you got--stiddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, good enough,\" said Bruce.  \"I'll engage to go anywhere that I can\r\nfind a foothold; and here's Bart, that'll go certainly as far, and\r\nperhaps farther.  And here's Phil, that can do his share.  As for Pat,\r\nhe can beat us all; he can travel like a fly, upside down, or in any\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I'm glad to hear that, boys, for it's likely you'll be wanted to\r\ndo some climbin afore we get back.  I used to do somethin in that way;\r\nbut since I've growed old, an rheumatic, I've got kine o' out o' the\r\nway of it, an don't scacely feel sech confidence in myself as I used to\r\nonst.  But come, we mustn't be waitin here all day.\"\r\n\r\nAt this they started up the path, and soon reached the top of the cliff.\r\n\r\nArriving here, they found themselves in a cultivated meadow, passing\r\nthrough which they reached a pasture field.  After a walk of about a\r\nquarter of a mile, they came to the cliff that ran along the shore of\r\nthe bay, and on reaching this, the whole bay burst upon their view.\r\n\r\nIt was still a beautiful day; the sun was shining brilliantly, and his\r\nrays were reflected in a path of dazzling lustre from the face of the\r\nsea.  The wind was fresh, and the little waves tossed up their heads\r\nacross where the sunlight fell, flashing back the rays of the sun in\r\nperpetually changing light, and presenting to the eye the appearance of\r\ninnumerable dazzling stars.  Far away rose the Nova Scotia shore as\r\nthey had seen it in the morning, while up the bay, in the distance,\r\nabrupt, dark, and precipitous, arose the solitary Ile Haute.\r\n\r\nBeneath them the waters of the bay foamed and splashed; and though\r\nthere was not much surf, yet the waters came rolling among the rocks,\r\nseething and boiling, and extending as far as the eye could reach, up\r\nand down, in a long line of foam.\r\n\r\nReaching the edge, they all looked down.  At the bottom there were\r\nvisible the heads of black rocks, which arose above the waves at times,\r\nbut which, however, at intervals, were covered with the rolling waters\r\nthat tossed around them in foam and spray.  Nearer and higher up there\r\nwere rocks which projected like shelves from the face of the cliff, and\r\nseemed capable of affording a foothold to any climber; but their\r\nprojection served also to conceal from view what lay immediately\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole beach, however, up and down, there appeared no sign of\r\nhuman life.  Anxiously they looked, hoping to see some human form, in\r\nsome part of that long line of rock; but none was visible, and they\r\nlooked at one another in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, he don't turn up yet; that's clar,\" said Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"We can see a great deal from here, too,\" said Bart, in a despondent\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, an that's jest what makes the wust of it.  I thought that one look\r\nfrom a commandin pint would reveal the wanderer to our eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he is crouching in among the rocks down there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I rayther think he'd manage to git up a leetle further out of the\r\nreach of the surf than all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may be farther on.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; an I dare say he is, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"There don't seem to be any place below these rocks, where he would be\r\nlikely to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I think that jest here he could climb up, as fur as that thar\r\nshelf, certain.  He may be old an rheumatic, but he's able enough to\r\nclimb that fur.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think anything could have happened to him here, or we should\r\nsee some signs of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Course we would--we'd see his remains--we'd see his basket, or his\r\nhat, floatin and driftin about.  But thar's not a basket or a hat\r\nanywhar to be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cliff is long here, and runs in so from that point, that if he\r\nwent up any distance, it would be easy for him to be caught by the\r\nrising tide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Course it would.  O, yes, course.  That's the very thing that struck\r\nme.  It's very dangerous for an ole inexperienced man.  But come, we\r\nmustn't stand talkin, we must hurry on, or we may as well go back agin,\r\nat onst.\"\r\n\r\nStarting forward, they walked on for some time in silence.  For about a\r\nhundred yards they were able to keep close to the edge of the cliff, so\r\nas to look over; but after that they encountered a dense alder thicket.\r\nIn order to traverse this, they had to go farther inland, where there\r\nwas some sort of an opening.  There they came to a wood where the\r\nunderbrush was thick, and the walking difficult.  This they traversed,\r\nand at length worked their way once more to the edge of the cliff.\r\nLooking down here, they found the scene very much like what it had been\r\nfarther back.  The waves were dashing beneath them among rocks whose\r\nblack crests were at times visible among the foam, while from the\r\ncliffs there were the same projecting shelves which they had noticed\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"See there!\" cried Bart, pointing to a place behind them.  \"Do you see\r\nhow the cliff seems to go in there--just where the alder bushes grow?\r\nThat looks like a place where a man might be caught.  I wonder if he\r\nisn't there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we go and see?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you can git thar.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, it isn't far,\" said Bart.  \"I'll run back and look down.  The rest\r\nof you had better go on; I'll join you soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go with you,\" said Bruce.\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\nBruce and Bart then set out, and forced their way through the dense\r\nalder bushes, until at length they found themselves near the place.\r\nHere there was a chasm in the line of cliff, reaching from the top to\r\nthe bottom.  The sides were precipitous, and they could see perfectly\r\nwell all the way down.  At the bottom the water was rolling and\r\ntossing; and this, together with the precipitous cliffs, showed them\r\nplainly that no one could have found shelter here.\r\n\r\nSadly and silently they returned, and rejoined the others, who had been\r\nwalking along in advance.\r\n\r\n\"Wal?\" said Captain Corbet, interrogatively.\r\n\r\nBart shook his head.\r\n\r\nThey then walked on for some time in silence.  \"Come,\" said Captain\r\nCorbet; \"we've been makin one mistake ever sence we started.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've kep altogether too still.  How do we know but we've passed him\r\nsomewhar along down thar.  We can't see behind all them corners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's shout now--the rest of the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; that's it; yell like all possessed.\"\r\n\r\nThe cries of the boys now burst forth in shrill screams and yells,\r\nwhich were echoed among the woods and rocks around.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" cried Captain Corbet, \"all together!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys shouted all together.\r\n\r\n\"That'll fetch him,\" said the captain, \"ef anythin doos.  It's a pity\r\nwe didn't think of this afore.  What an ole fool I must ha ben to\r\nforgit that!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys now walked on shouting, and screaming, and yelling\r\nincessantly, and waiting, from time to time, to listen for an answer.\r\n\r\nBut no answer came.\r\n\r\nAt times Captain Corbet's voice sounded forth.  His cry was a very\r\npeculiar one.  It was high pitched, shrill, and penetrating, and seemed\r\nas though it ought to be heard for miles.  But the united voices of the\r\nboys, and the far-piercing yell of the captain, all sounded equally in\r\nvain.  No response came, and at last, after standing still and\r\nlistening for a longer time than usual, they all looked despondingly at\r\none another, as though each were waiting for the other to suggest some\r\nnew plan of action.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stood and looked musingly out upon the sea, as though\r\nthe sight of the rolling waters assisted his meditations. It was some\r\ntime before he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what it is, boys,\" said he at last.  \"We've ben makin\r\nanother mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've gone to work wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what can we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, fust an foremost, I muve we go back on our tracks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, you see, one thing,--Solomon can't hev come further than this by\r\nno possibility, onless he started straight off to walk all the way up\r\nthe bay agin, back to Petticoat Jack by the shore route,--an as that's\r\ntoo rough a route for an ole man, why, I calc'late it's not to be\r\nthought of.  Ef, on the contrairy, he only kem out to hunt for fish,\r\n'tain't likely he come as fur as this, an in my pinion he didn't come\r\nnigh as fur.  You see we're a good piece on, and Solomon wouldn't hev\r\ncome so fur if he'd cal'lated to get back to the schewner.  What d'ye\r\nsay to that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've thought of that already,\" said Bruce, sadly.  \"We've certainly\r\ngone as far as he could possibly have gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrew,\" said Captain Corbet, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"But what can we do now?\" asked Bart.\r\n\r\n\"Fust of all, go back.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! give him up?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say that.  I said to go back, an keep a good lookout along\r\nthe shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we've done that already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know; but then we didn't begin to yell till quite lately,\r\nwhereas we'd ought to hev yelled from the time of fust startin. Now, I\r\nthink ef we went back yellin all the way, we'd have a chance of turnin\r\nhim up somewhar back thar whar we fust came in sight of the cliff.\r\nVery likely, if he ain't already drownded, he's a twisted himself up in\r\nsome holler in the cliff back thar.  He couldn't hev got this fur,\r\ncertain,--unless he'd ben a runnin away.\"\r\n\r\nAll this seemed so certain to the boys that they had nothing to say in\r\nopposition to it.  In fact, as Bruce said, they had already gone as far\r\nas Solomon could possibly have gone, and this thought had occurred to\r\nthem all.  Captain Corbet's proposition, therefore, seemed to them the\r\nonly course to follow.  So they all turned and went back again.\r\n\r\n\"What I was a goin to say,\" remarked Captain Corbet, after walking a\r\nfew paces,--\"what I was a goin to say was this.  The mistake I made was\r\nin not gettin a boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"A boat?  Why we've traced the coast from the cliff well\r\nenough--haven't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not well enough.  We'd ought to have planned this here expedition\r\nmore kerfully.  It wan't enough to go along the top of the cliff this\r\nhere way.  You see, we've not been able to take in the lower part of\r\nthe cliff underneath.  We'd ought to hev got a boat.  Some of us could\r\nhev gone along the cliff, jest as we hev ben doin, and the others could\r\nhave pulled along the shore an kep up a sharp lookout that way.  We've\r\nlost any quantity o' time that way, but that's no reason why we should\r\nlose any more; so I muve that some of us go back, right straight off,\r\nan get a boat at the ship-yard, an come back.  I'll go, unless some o'\r\nyouns think yourselfes smarter, which ain't onlikely.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, you can't run, captain,\" said Bart.  \"Bruce and I will go, and\r\nwe'll run all the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, that's the very best thing that you could do.  You're both young,\r\nan actyve.  As for me, my days of youth an actyvity air over, an I'm in\r\nthe sere an yaller leaf, with spells o' rheumatics. So you start off as\r\nquick as your legs can carry you, an ef you run all the way, so much\r\nthe better.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys started off at this, and going on the full run, they hurried,\r\nas fast as possible, back over the path they had traversed, and through\r\nthe woods, and over the fields, and down the cliff towards the\r\nship-yard.\r\n\r\nPhil and Pat, however, remained with Captain Corbet; and these three\r\nwalked back along the edge of the cliff; still looking down carefully\r\nfor signs of Solomon, and keeping up constantly their loud, shrill\r\ncries.\r\n\r\nThus they walked back, till, at length, they reached the place where\r\nthe alders were growing.  Here they were compelled to make a detour as\r\nbefore, after which they returned to the cliff, and walked along,\r\nshouting and yelling as when they came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nBack again.--Calls and Cries.--Captain Corbet's Yell.--A significant\r\nSign.--The old Hat.--The return Cry.--The Boat rounds the Point.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet, with Phil and Pat, walked along the top of the cliff in\r\nthis way, narrowly scrutinizing the rocks below, and calling and\r\nshouting, until, at length, they reached the place at which they had\r\nfirst come out upon the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys,\" said the captain, \"from here to the pint down thar is all\r\nnew ground.  We must go along here, an keep a good lookout.  If we hev\r\nany chance left of findin anythin, it's thar.  I'm ony sorry we didn't\r\nexamine this here fust an foremost, before wanderin away off up thar,\r\nwhar 'tain't at all likely that Solomon ever dreamed of goin.  I hope\r\nthe boys won't be long gettin off that thar boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they can't get one.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, they can.  I saw two or three down thar.\"\r\n\r\nThey now walked on a little farther.\r\n\r\nAt this place the cliff was as steep as it had been behind; but the\r\nrocky shelves were more numerous, and down near the shore they\r\nprojected, one beyond another, so that they looked like natural steps.\r\n\r\n\"If Solomon was caught by the tide anywhar hereabouts,\" said Captain\r\nCorbet, \"thar's no uthly reason why he shouldn't save himself.  He\r\ncould walk up them rocks jest like goin up stairs, an git out of the\r\nway of the heaviest surf an the highest tide that these shores ever\r\nsaw.\"\r\n\r\n\"It all depends,\" said Phil, \"on whether he staid about here, or went\r\nfarther up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Course--an it's my opinion that he did stay about here.  He was never\r\nsuch an old fool as to go so far up as we did.  Why, ef he'd a done so\r\nover them rocks, he'd never have got the use of his legs agin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange we don't see any signs of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, wal, thar's places yet we hevn't tried.\"\r\n\r\n\"One thing is certain--we haven't found any signs of him.  If anything\r\nhad happened, we'd have seen his basket floating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, or his old hat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think, if he were anywhere hereabouts, he'd hear the noise;\r\nwe are shouting loud enough, I'm sure.  As for your voice, why, he\r\nought to hear it a mile away; and the point down there doesn't seem to\r\nbe a quarter that distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, it's further than that; besides, my voice can't penetrate so easily\r\ndown thar.  It gits kine o' lost among the rocks.  It can go very easy\r\nin a straight line; but when it's got to turn corners an go kine o'\r\nround the edges o' sharp rocks, it don't get on so well by a long\r\nchalk.  But I think I'll try an divarsify these here proceedins by\r\nyellin a leetle lower down.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Captain Corbet knelt down, and putting his head over the\r\ncliff, he uttered the loudest, and sharpest, and shrillest yell that he\r\ncould give.  Then he listened in silence, and the boys also listened in\r\nbreathless expectation for some time.  But there was no response\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet arose with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, boys,\" said he, in a mournful tone, \"we must git on to the pint.\r\nWe'd ought to know the wust pooty soon.  But, at any rate, I'm bound to\r\nhope for the best till hope air over.\"\r\n\r\nThe little party now resumed their progress, and walked on towards the\r\npoint, shouting at intervals, as before.\r\n\r\nFrom this place on as far as the point, the ground was clear, and there\r\nwas nothing to bar their way.  They could go along without being\r\ncompelled to make any further detour, and could keep near enough to the\r\nedge to command a view of the rocks below.  They walked on, and shouted\r\nwithout ceasing, and thus traversed a portion of the way.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Captain Corbet's eye caught sight of something in the water.\r\nIt was round in shape, and was floating within a few feet of the shore,\r\non the top of a wave.  As Captain Corbet looked, the wave rolled from\r\nunderneath it, and dashed itself upon the rocks, while the floating\r\nobject seemed to be thrown farther out.  The tide had turned already,\r\nand was now on the ebb, so that floating articles, such as this, were\r\ncarried away from the shore, rather than towards it.\r\n\r\nUpon this Captain Corbet fastened his gaze, and stood in silence\r\nlooking at it.  At length he put his hand on Phil's shoulder, and\r\ndirected the attention of the boys to the floating object.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"That thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What--that round thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that round thing.  Look sharp at it now.  What doos it look like\r\nto your young eyes?\"\r\n\r\nPhil and Pat looked at it very carefully, and in silence.  Then Phil\r\nlooked up into Captain Corbet's face without saying a word.\r\n\r\n\"Wal?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, do you think?\" asked Phil, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"What do YOU think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure an it's a hat--a sthraw hat,\" said Pat.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet exchanged a meaning glance with Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it's HIS hat?\" asked Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Whose else can it be?\"\r\n\r\nPhil was silent, and his gaze was once more directed to the floating\r\nobject.  As it rose and fell on the waves, it showed the unmistakable\r\noutline of a straw hat, and was quite near enough for them to recognize\r\nits general character and color.  It was dark, with the edges rather\r\nragged, a broad brim, and a roomy crown, not by any means of a\r\nfashionable or graceful shape, but coarse, and big, and roomy, and\r\nshabby--just such a hat as Solomon had put on his head when he left\r\nGrand Pre with them on this memorable and ill-fated voyage.\r\n\r\nThey looked at it for a long time in silence, and none of them moved.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\"This here,\" said he, \"has been a eventfool vyge.  I felt a derred\r\npersentment afore I started.  Long ago I told you how the finger of\r\ndestiny seemed to warn me away from the ocean main.  I kem to the\r\nconclusion, you remember, that henceforth I was to dwell under my own\r\nvine an fig tree, engaged in the tender emplymint of nussin the infant.\r\nBut from this I was forced agin my own inclynations.  An what's the\r\nresult?  Why, this--that thar hat!  See here, boys;\" and the venerable\r\nseaman's tone grew deeper, and more solemn, and more impressive; \"see\r\nhere, boys,\" he repeated; \"for mor'n forty year hev I follered the\r\nseas, an traversed the briny deep; but, though I've hed my share of\r\nstorms an accydints, though I've ben shipwrecked onst or twiste, yet\r\nnever has it ben my lot to experience any loss of human life.  But now,\r\nbut now, boys, call to mind the startlin events of this here vyge!\r\nThink of your companion an playmate a driftin off in that startlin\r\nmanner from Petticoat Jack!  An now look here--gaze upon that thar!\r\nWords air footil!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you give him up, then?\" cried Phil.  \"Poor, poor old Solomon!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"'Deed, thin, an I don't!\" cried Pat.  \"What's a hat?  'Tain't a man,\r\nso it isn't.  Many's the man that's lost his hat, an ain't lost his\r\nlife.  It's a windy place here, an ole Solomon's hat's a mile too big\r\nfor him, so it is--'deed an it is.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head more gloomily than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Ow, sure an ye needn't be shakin yer head that way.  Sure an haven't\r\nye lost hats av yer own, over an over?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" said the captain.  \"I never lost a hat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver got one blowed off?  'Deed an ye must have.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never got one blowed off.  When the wind blowed hard I allus kep 'em\r\ntied on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Solomon hadn't any tie to his, an it cud tumble off his old pate\r\nasy enough, so it cud.  Sure he's lost it jumpin over the rocks.\r\nBesides, where's his basket?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the bottom, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure an it cud float.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I dar say it was full of lobsters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any how, I'll not believe he's gone till I see him,\" cried Pat,\r\nearnestly.  \"Seein's believin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ef he's gone,\" said Captain Corbet, more solemnly than ever, \"ye'll\r\nnever see him.  These waters take too good care of a man for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yer all givin up too soon,\" said Pat.  \"Come along now; there's\r\nlots of places yet to examin.  Give one of yer loudest yells.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet did so.  In spite of his despondency as to poor old\r\nSolomon's fate, he was not at all unwilling to try any further chances.\r\nOn this occasion he seemed to gain unusual energy out of his very\r\ndespair; and the yell that burst from him was so high, so shrill, so\r\npiercing, and so far penetrating, that the former cries were nothing\r\ncompared to it.\r\n\r\n\"Well done!\" cried Pat.  \"Sure an you bet yerself that time, out an\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" cried Phil.  \"Listen.  What's that?\"\r\n\r\nFar away, as they listened, they heard a faint cry, that seemed like a\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the echo?\" asked Phil, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Niver an echo!\" cried Pat, excitedly.  \"Shout agin, captain, darlin.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet gave another shout as loud and as shrill as the\r\npreceding one.\r\n\r\nThey listened anxiously.\r\n\r\nAgain they heard the cry.  It was faint and far off; yet it was\r\nunmistakably a human cry.  Their excitement now grew intense.\r\n\r\n\"Where did it come from?\" cried Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, it kine o' seemed to me that it came back thar,\" said the\r\ncaptain, pointing to the woods.\r\n\r\n\"'Deed an it didn't,\" cried Pat; \"not a bit of it.  It was from the\r\nshore, jest ahead; from the pint, so it was, or I'm a nagur.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it came from the shore, too,\" said Phil; \"but it seemed to be\r\nbehind us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Niver a bit,\" cried Pat; \"not back there.  We've been there, an\r\nwhoever it was wud have shouted afore, so he wud.  No, it's ahead at\r\nthe pint.  He's jest heard us, an he's shoutin afther us. Hooray!\r\nHurry up, an we'll be there in time to save him.\"\r\n\r\nPat's confidence was not without its effect on the others.  Without\r\nwaiting any longer, they at once set off at a run, stopping at\r\nintervals to yell, and then listening for a response.  To their\r\ndelight, that response came over and over again; and to their still\r\ngreater joy, the sound each time was evidently louder.\r\n\r\nBeyond a doubt, they were drawing nearer to the place from which the\r\nsounds came.\r\n\r\nThis stimulated them all the more, so that they hurried on faster.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the cliff was not covered by any trees, but the ground at\r\nits summit had been cleared, so that progress was not at all difficult.\r\nThey therefore did not take much time in traversing the space that\r\nintervened between the spot where they had first heard the cry, and the\r\npoint where the cliff terminated.  The cry grew steadily louder, all\r\nthe way, until at last, when they approached the point, it seemed to\r\ncome directly from beneath.\r\n\r\nThe cliff here was perpendicular for about forty feet down, and below\r\nthis it seemed to retreat, so that nothing could be seen. The tide was\r\non the ebb; but it was still so high that its waves beat below them,\r\nand seemed to strike the base of the rock. Beyond, on the right, there\r\nwas a sloping ledge, which descended from the cliffs into the sea, over\r\nwhich the waves were now playing.\r\n\r\nIt was from the hollow and unseen recess down at the foot of the cliff\r\nthat the cry seemed to arise, which had come in response to the calls\r\nof those on the summit.  On reaching the place above, they knelt down,\r\nand looked over, but were not able to distinguish any human being, or\r\nany sign of the presence of one.  But as they looked anxiously over,\r\nthe cry arose, not very loud, but quite distinct now, and assured them\r\nthat this was the place which sheltered the one who had uttered that\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet now thrust his head over as far as he could, and gave a\r\ncall in his loudest voice.\r\n\r\n\"Hal-lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!\"\r\n\r\nTo which there came up in answer a cry that sounded like--\r\n\r\n\"Hi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i!\"\r\n\r\n\"Solomo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-on!\"\r\n\r\n\"He-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that yo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ou?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are y-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ou?\"\r\n\r\n\"He-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-re!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come u-u-u-u-u-u-u-up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ca-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-n't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Too hi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-gh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go round the pi-i-i-i-i-i-nt!\"\r\n\r\n\"Too high ti-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-de!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-it!\"\r\n\r\n\"All ri-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ght!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet now sprang up as nimbly as a young lad, and looked at\r\nPhil and Pat with an expression of such exceeding triumph, that his\r\nface seemed fairly to shine.\r\n\r\n\"It IS Solomon!\" he cried.  But it was of no use for him to convey that\r\npiece of information to the boys, who already knew that fact quite as\r\nwell as he did.\r\n\r\n\"It IS Solomon,\" he repeated; \"an now the pint is, how air we to git\r\nhim up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me go down,\" said Pat.\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure an I can git down wid that bit o' rope you have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe you can, an then agin mebbe you can't; but s'posin you was to\r\ngit down, how upon airth would that help the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure an we cud give him a pull up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think we could manage that,\" said Captain Corbet, \"and you\r\ncouldn't, at any rate, if you were down thar with him.  As far as I\r\nsee, we'll hev to wait till the tide falls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be better,\" said Phil, \"for us to go around, so as to come\r\nnearer?\"\r\n\r\n\"How?  Whar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, down to the beach, and then we could walk around the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Walk?  Why, it's high water.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is--I forgot that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, we can't git any nearer than we air now.  Then, agin, the\r\nboys'll be along in a boat soon.  They ought to be here by this time;\r\nso let's sit down here, an wait till they heave in sight.\"\r\n\r\nWith a call of encouragement to Solomon which elicited a reply of\r\nsatisfaction, Captain Corbet sat down upon the grass, and the boys\r\nfollowed his example.  In this position they waited quietly for the\r\nboat to come.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bart and Bruce had hurried on as rapidly as their legs could\r\ncarry them, and at length reached the path which went down to the\r\nbeach.  Down this they scrambled, and not long afterwards they reached\r\nthe ship-yard.  Here they obtained a boat without any difficulty, which\r\nthe workmen launched for them; and then they pushed off, and pulled for\r\nthe point, with the intention of rowing along opposite the shore, and\r\nnarrowly inspecting it.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they reached the point, however, when a loud and\r\nwell-known voice sounded from on high.  They both turned and looked up,\r\nstill pulling.  There they saw Captain Corbet, and Phil, and Pat, all\r\nof whom were shouting and making furious gestures at them.\r\n\r\n\"We've found him!  Come in closer!\" cried Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"Whe-e-e-re?\" cried Bruce.\r\n\r\nBut before any answer could come, a loud, shrill scream, followed by a\r\nyell of delight, burst forth from some place still nearer.\r\n\r\nBurt and Bruce both started, and looked towards the place from which\r\nthis last cry came.\r\n\r\nThere a very singular and pleasing sight met their eyes.\r\n\r\nAbout six feet above the water was a shelf of rock, that ran down\r\nsloping to the beach, and over this there projected a great mass of the\r\ncliff.  In this recess there crouched a familiar figure.  He had no\r\nhat, but between his legs, as he sat there, he held a basket, to which\r\nhe clung with his knees and his hands.  As he sat there his eyes were\r\nfixed upon them, and their whites seemed enlarged to twice their\r\nordinary dimensions, while yell after yell came from him.\r\n\r\n\"Help, he-e-e-e-e-lp!  Mas'r Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-art!  O, Mas'r\r\nBa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-art!  He-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-lp!\r\nSa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ave me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" cried Bart and Bruce, in a burst of heartfelt joy.\r\n\r\n\"He-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-lp!\" came forth once more from Solomon.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" cried Bart; and at once the boat pointed towards the place\r\nwhere Solomon was sitting.  The water nearer the shore was somewhat\r\nrough, but fortunately there were no rocks just there, and they were\r\nable to bring the boat in close to the place where Solomon was\r\nconfined.  At their approach Solomon moved slowly down the incline of\r\nthe rock, on his hands and knees, for there was not room for him to\r\nstand upright; and as he moved he pushed the basket before him, as\r\nthough there was something inside of uncommon value. Reaching, at\r\nlength, a spot where the rock was about the level of the boat, he\r\nwaited for them to approach.  Soon the boat touched the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Come, old Sol,\" cried Bart, \"jump in!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hyah, take hole ob dis yar,\" said Solomon, even in that moment of\r\nrescue refusing to move till his precious basket should be safe.\r\n\r\nBart grasped it, and put it into the boat, noticing, as he did so, that\r\nit was full of lobsters.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Solomon, hurry up.  I don't like the boat to be knocking here\r\nthis way.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, sah,\" said Solomon, crawling along rather stiffly; \"ben\r\ntied up in a knot all day, an feel so stiff dat I don't know as I'll\r\ngit untied agin fur ebber mo.  Was jest makin my will, any way, as you\r\ncame along.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Solomon had tumbled into the boat, and worked his way aft,\r\nthough not without many groans.\r\n\r\n\"It's de cold rocks, an de wet,\" he groaned.  \"Sech an attack o'\r\nrheumaticses as dis ole nigga's gwine to hab beats all!  Any how, I ben\r\nan sabed de lobsta.  Loss me ole hat, but didn't car a mite fer dat so\r\nlong as I sabed de lobsta.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" cried Bart; and at this the two boys pulled away from the\r\nrocks and rounded the point.  As they came into the sight of those who\r\nwere waiting on the top of the cliff, a shout of joy arose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nExploring Juan Fernandez.--The Cliffs.--The tangled Underbrush.--The\r\nFog Bank.--Is it coming or going?--The Steamer.--Vain Appeals.--New\r\nPlans.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting off, as we have seen, to explore the island, Tom first\r\ndirected his steps towards the elevated land which has before been\r\nmentioned.  At first his path was easy, and the descent very gradual;\r\nbut at length it became more difficult, and he had to ascend a steep\r\nhill, which was over-strewn with stones and interspersed with trees and\r\nmounds.  Up among these he worked his way, and at length the ascent\r\nceased.  He was on the summit of the island.  Here he walked to the\r\nedge of the area on which he stood, and found himself on the edge of a\r\nprecipice that went sheer down to a beach, which was apparently two\r\nhundred feet beneath him.  The precipice seemed actually to lean\r\nforward out of the perpendicular, and so tremendous was the view\r\nbeneath, that Tom, although not by any means inclined to be nervous,\r\nfound his head grow giddy as he looked down.  Looking forth thus from\r\nhis dizzy elevation, he could see across the bay to the New Brunswick\r\nshore, and could mark the general course which his drifting boat must\r\nhave taken over those deep, dark, and treacherous waters.\r\n\r\nThe sea was broad, and blue, and tranquil, and desolate, for even from\r\nthis commanding height not a sail was visible.  There was nothing here\r\nwhich could attract Tom's attention for any long period; so he prepared\r\nto continue his progress.  In front of him lay a wood, before plunging\r\nin which he turned to see if there were any vessels coming through the\r\nStraits of Minas.  None were visible; so, turning back once more, he\r\nresumed his journey, and went forward among the trees.\r\n\r\nHis path now became a difficult one.  It was necessary to keep away\r\nfrom the edge of the cliff, but still not to go out of sight of it. The\r\ntrees were principally spruce and fir, but there were also birch and\r\nmaple.  He also noticed mountain ash and willow.  Beneath him all the\r\nground was covered with soft moss, in which he sank to his ankles,\r\nwhile on every side were luxuriant ferns and evergreen trailers.  Tom\r\nrecognized all these with great satisfaction, for they showed him the\r\nmeans of furnishing for himself a soft couch, that might be envied by\r\nmany a man in better circumstances. Progress soon grew more difficult,\r\nfor there were numerous mounds, and dense underbrush, through which he\r\ncould only force his way by extreme effort.  Windfalls also lay around\r\nin all directions, and no sooner would he have fairly surmounted one of\r\nthem, than another would appear.  Thus his progress was exceedingly\r\nslow and laborious.\r\n\r\nAfter about a half an hour of strenuous exertion, Tom found himself in\r\nthe midst of an almost impassable jungle of tangled, stunted fir trees.\r\nHe tried to avoid these by making a detour, but found that they\r\nextended so far that he could only pass them by going along close to\r\nthe edge of the cliff.  This last path he chose, and clinging to the\r\nbranches, he passed for more than a hundred yards along the crest of a\r\nfrightful precipice, where far down there yawned an abyss, at whose\r\nbottom was the sea; while abreast of him in the air there floated great\r\nflocks of gulls, uttering their hoarse yells, and fluttering fiercely\r\nabout, as though trying to drive back this intruder upon their domains.\r\nOnce or twice Tom was compelled to stop, and turn away his face from\r\nthe abyss, and thrust himself in among the trees; but each time he\r\nregained his courage, after a little rest, and went on as before.\r\n\r\nAt length he passed the thick spruce underbrush, and found the woods\r\nless dense.  He could now work his way among them without being\r\ncompelled to go so close to the edge of the cliff; and the dizzy height\r\nand the shrieks of the gulls no longer disturbed his senses.  The trees\r\nhere were not so high as those at the other end of the island, but were\r\nof much smaller size, and seemed stunted. There were no maples or other\r\nforest trees, but only scraggy fir, that seemed too exposed to the\r\nwinds from the sea to have much health or verdure.  The underbrush was\r\nwanting to a great extent, but moss was here in large quantities, and\r\nthick clusters of alder bushes.  Wild shrubs also--such as raspberries\r\nand blueberries--were frequently met with; while ledges of\r\nweather-beaten rock jutted out from amid thick coverings of moss.\r\n\r\nWalking here was not at all difficult, and he went on without any\r\ninterruption, until, at last, he found any farther progress barred by a\r\nprecipice.  He was at the lower or western end of the island.\r\n\r\nHe looked down, and found beneath him a great precipice, while rocks\r\njutted out from the sea, and ledges projected beyond.  The gulls were\r\npresent here, as elsewhere, in great flocks, and still kept up their\r\nnoisy screams.\r\n\r\nTom looked out over the sea, and saw its waters spread far away till it\r\nwas lost in the horizon.  On the line of that horizon he saw a faint\r\ngray cloud, that looked like a fog bank.  It had, to his eyes, a\r\ncertain gloomy menace, and seemed to say to him that he had not seen\r\nthe last of it yet.  On the left of the broad sea, the Nova Scotia\r\nCoast ran along till it was lost in the distance; and on the right was\r\nthe long line of the New Brunswick shore, both of which had now that\r\ndark hue of olive green which he had noticed on the land opposite\r\nbefore he had started.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, while he was looking, his eyes caught sight of something\r\nwhite that glistened brightly from the blue water.  It was about midway\r\nbetween the two coasts, and he knew it at once to be some sailing\r\nvessel.  He could not make out more than one sail, and that showed that\r\nthe vessel was either coming up the bay or going down; for if it had\r\nbeen crossing, she would, of course, have lain broadside on to his\r\npresent locality, and would have thus displayed two sails to his view.\r\nThe sight of this vessel agitated him exceedingly; and the question\r\nabout her probable course now entered his mind, and drove away all\r\nother thoughts.  Whether that vessel were going up or down became of\r\nexclusive importance to him now, if she were coming up, she might\r\napproach him, and hear his hail, or catch sight of his signals.\r\nSuddenly he reflected that he had no way of attracting attention, and a\r\nwild desire of running back and setting up the longest pole or board\r\nthat he could find came into his mind; but such was the intensity of\r\nhis curiosity, and the weight of his suspense, that he could not move\r\nfrom the spot where he was until he had satisfied himself as to the\r\nvessel's course.\r\n\r\nHe sat down not far from the edge of the precipice, and, leaning\r\nforward with his hands supporting his chin, he strained his eyes over\r\nthe intervening distance, as he tried to make out in which way the\r\nvessel was going.  It seemed fully ten miles away, and her hull was not\r\nvisible.  It was only the white of her sails that he saw; and as the\r\nsunlight played on these from time to time, or fell off from the angle\r\nof reflection, the vessel was alternately more or less visible, and\r\nthus seemed by turns to draw nearer and depart farther from his sight.\r\n\r\nThus for a long time he sat, alternately hoping and desponding, at\r\nevery play of those sails in the sunlight.  The calm of the water\r\nshowed him that, even if the vessel were coming up, he could not expect\r\nany very rapid progress.  There was now no wind, and the surface of the\r\nwater was perfectly unruffled.  Besides, he knew that the tide was\r\nfalling rapidly.  How, then, could he expect that the vessel could come\r\nany nearer, even if she were trying to? Thoughts like these at last\r\nmade him only anxious to keep the vessel in sight.  If her destination\r\nlay up the bay, she would probably anchor; if it lay down the bay, she\r\nwould drift with the tide.  He thought, then, that if she only would\r\nremain in sight, it would be a sufficient proof of her course.\r\n\r\nThus he sat, watching and waiting, with all his soul intent upon those\r\nflashing sails, and all his thoughts taken up with the question as to\r\nthe course of that solitary bark.  It seemed a long time to him, in his\r\nsuspense; but suspense always makes time seem long.  At last, however,\r\neven though he hoped so persistently for the best, his hope began to\r\ndie within him.  Fainter and fainter grew those sails; at intervals\r\nrarer and rarer did their flash come to his eyes, until at length the\r\nsight of them was lost altogether, and nothing met his eyes but the\r\ngloomy gray of the fog cloud on the far horizon.\r\n\r\nEven after he had lost hope, and become convinced that she was gone,\r\nTom sat there for a long time, in a fixed attitude, looking at that one\r\nspot.  He would have sat there longer, but suddenly there came to his\r\nears a peculiar sound, which made him start to his feet in a moment,\r\nand filled him with a new excitement.\r\n\r\nHe listened.\r\n\r\nThe sound came again.\r\n\r\nA flush of joy spread over his face, his heart beat faster and faster,\r\nand he listened as though he could scarce believe his senses.\r\n\r\nAs he listened, the sounds came again, and this time much louder.\r\n\r\nThere was now no mistake about it.  It was a regular boat, which Tom\r\nknew well to be the peculiar sound made by the floats of a steamer's\r\npaddles.  He had often heard it.  He had but recently heard it, when\r\nthe revenue steamer was approaching the Antelope, and again during the\r\nfoggy night, when the whistle roused them, and the same beat of the\r\npaddles came over the midnight waters.\r\n\r\nAnd now, too, he heard it.\r\n\r\nHe gave a shout of joy, and started off to catch sight of her.\r\n\r\nFor a few paces only he ran, and then stopped.\r\n\r\nHe was puzzled.  He did not know in which direction it was best to go.\r\nHe was at the west end of the island, but could not make out very well\r\nthe direction of the sounds.  He tried to think whether the steamer\r\nwould pass the island on the north side or the south. He did not know,\r\nbut it seemed to him that she would certainly go to the north of it.\r\nThere was no time to be lost, and standing there to listen did not seem\r\nto be of any use, even if his impatience had allowed him to do so.\r\nAccordingly he hurried back by the way that he had come along the north\r\nside of the island.\r\n\r\nFor some time he ran along through the trees, and at length, in about\r\nfifteen or twenty minutes, he reached the place where the dense\r\nunderbrush was, by the edge of the cliff.  From this point a wide view\r\nwas commanded.  On reaching it he looked out, and then up the bay,\r\ntowards the Straits of Minas.  He could see almost up to the straits,\r\nbut no steamer appeared.  For a moment he stood bewildered, and then\r\nthe thought came to him, that he had mistaken altogether the steamer's\r\ncourse.  She could not be coming down on the north side of the island,\r\nbut on the south side.  With a cry of grief he started back again,\r\nmourning over his error, and the time that he had lost.  On reaching\r\nthe more open wood, he thought that it would be better to hurry across\r\nthe island to the south side, and proceeded at once to do so.  The way\r\nwas rough and tedious. Once or twice he had to burst through thickets\r\nof alder, and several times he had to climb over windfalls.  At length,\r\nin his confusion, he lost his way altogether; he had to stop and think.\r\nThe shadows of the trees showed him where the south lay, and he resumed\r\nhis journey.  At length, after most exhaustive efforts, he reached a\r\npart of the cliff, where a fringe of alders grew so thick, that he was\r\nscarce aware that he was at his destination, until the precipice opened\r\nbeneath him.  Here he stood, and, pressing apart the dense branches, he\r\nlooked out.\r\n\r\nThere was the steamer, about two miles off, already below where he was\r\nstanding, and going rapidly down the bay with the falling tide.\r\n\r\nAnother cry of grief burst from Tom.  Where he was standing he could\r\nsee the vessel, but he himself was completely concealed by the\r\nclustering bushes.  He now lamented that he had left his first\r\nposition, and saw that his only chance was to have remained there.\r\n\r\nTo stay where he was could not be thought of.  There was scarce a\r\nchance now of doing anything, since the steamer was so far away; but\r\nwhat chance there was certainly depended on his being in some\r\nconspicuous position.  He started off, therefore, to the west point,\r\nwhere he had watched the schooner for so long a time.  He hurried on\r\nwith undiminished energy, and bounded over windfalls, and burst through\r\nthickets, as before.  But in spite of his efforts, his progress could\r\nnot be more rapid than it had formerly been.  His route was necessarily\r\ncircuitous, and before he could find the desired point, many more\r\nminutes had elapsed.\r\n\r\nBut he reached it at last, and there, on the bare rock, springing\r\nforward, he waved his hat in the air, and sent forth a piercing cry for\r\nhelp.  But the steamer was now as much as four or five miles away--too\r\nfar altogether for his loudest cry to go.  His screams and his gestures\r\ndid not appear to attract the slightest attention. She moved on her way\r\nright under the eyes of the frantic and despairing boy, nor did she\r\nchange her course in the slightest degree, nor did her paddles cease to\r\nrevolve, but went rolling round, tossing up the foam, and bearing far,\r\nfar away that boat on which poor Tom had rested his last hope.\r\n\r\nAs for Tom, he kept up his screams as long as he could utter a sound.\r\nHe tore off his coat, and shook it up and down, and waved it backward\r\nand forward.  But none of these things were heard or seen.  The\r\nsteamboat passed on, until, at length, even Tom became convinced that\r\nfurther efforts were useless.\r\n\r\nThis last blow was too much.  Tom sank under it, and, falling on his\r\nface, he burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nStruggling up at length from this last affliction, Tom roused himself,\r\nand his buoyancy of soul began once more to assert itself.\r\n\r\n\"Come now, Thomas, my son,\" said he, as he dried his eyes, \"this sort\r\nof thing will never do, you know.  You're not a baby, my boy; you've\r\nnever been given to blubbering, I think.  Cheer up, then, like a man,\r\nand don't make me feel ashamed of you.\"\r\n\r\nThis little address to himself had, as before, the effect of restoring\r\nhis equanimity, and he thought with calmness upon his recent\r\ndisappointments.\r\n\r\nHe saw, by the passage of these vessels, what he had for a time lost\r\nsight of, namely, that this island, though uninhabited, was still in\r\nthe middle of a bay which was constantly traversed by sailing vessels\r\nand steamboats.  The latter ran regularly up to the Basin of Minas from\r\nSt. John.  As to the former, they were constantly passing to and fro,\r\nfrom the large ship down to the small fishing vessel.  Inhabited\r\ncountries surrounded him on every side, between the coasts of which\r\nthere was a constant communication. If he only kept patient, the time\r\nmust come, and that, too, before very long, when he would be delivered.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure this delivery, however, he saw that it would be\r\nnecessary to arrange some way by which he might attract the notice of\r\npassing vessels.  On this subject he meditated for a long time. It\r\nwould be necessary, he thought, to have some sort of a signal in some\r\nconspicuous place.  Among the drift-wood he might, perhaps, be able to\r\nfind some sort of a pole or staff which he could set up. One might not\r\nbe enough, but in that case he could put up two, or three, or half a\r\ndozen.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to decide about was the choice of a place.  There was\r\nthe east end, and the west end--which was the better?  The west end,\r\nwhere he was standing, was high; but then it was surrounded by trees,\r\nand unless he could set up a very tall staff, it could scarcely be\r\nnoticed.  The east end, on the contrary, was lower; but then it was\r\nbare, and any kind of a signal which might be set up there could hardly\r\nfail to attract attention.  He could also pile up a heap of drift-wood,\r\nand set fire to it, and, by this means, if a vessel were passing by, he\r\ncould be certain of securing attention.  It did not make much\r\ndifference which end the signals were placed upon, as far as referred\r\nto the passing of vessels; for all that passed by would go along the\r\nisland, so that both ends would be visible to them.\r\n\r\nAs to the signals, he felt confident that he could find a staff, or, if\r\none would not be long enough, several could be fastened together.  The\r\ncoil of rope in the boat would enable him to do this.  The sail would\r\nafford material for a flag.\r\n\r\nAll these plans came to his mind as he stood there; and the prospect of\r\nonce more doing something which was to help him to escape from his\r\nprison drove away the last vestige of his grief. His courage again\r\narose, hope revived, and he burst forth into a light and joyous song.\r\nVery different was he now from the despairing lad who, but a short time\r\nbefore, had been pouring forth his tears of sorrow; and yet but a few\r\nminutes had passed since then.  The steamer was yet in sight down the\r\nbay, but Tom, who had lately been so frantic in his efforts to attract\r\nher attention, now cast a glance after her of perfect indifference.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was necessary for him to return to the east end of the\r\nisland, and look about for the means of putting into execution his plan\r\nfor making a signal.\r\n\r\nHe started off on his return without any further delay.  The path back\r\nwas as rough and toilsome as the way down had been; but Tom was now\r\nfull of hope, and his elastic spirits had revived so thoroughly that he\r\ncared but little for the fatigue of the journey. It was traversed at\r\nlast, and he descended the slope to the place from which he had started.\r\n\r\nHis exploration of the island had been quite complete.  It seemed to\r\nhim to be about a mile and a half in length, and a half a mile or so in\r\nwidth.  The east end, where he had first arrived, was the only place\r\nwhere it was at all desirable to stay.\r\n\r\nImmediately on his arrival he examined the boat, and found it secure.\r\nTo his surprise it was now about sunset.  He had forgotten the lapse of\r\ntime.  He was hungry; so he sat down, ate his biscuit, drank his water,\r\nand rested from the toils of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nA Sign for the outer World.--A Shelter for the Outcast's Head.--Tom's\r\nCamp and Camp-bed.--A Search after Something to vary a too monotonous\r\nDiet.--Brilliant Success.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom sat down after his eventful day, and took his evening meal, as has\r\nbeen said.  He rested then for some time.  His excessive labors had\r\nfatigued him less than the great excitement which he had undergone, and\r\nnow he felt disinclined to exert himself.  But the sun had set, and\r\ndarkness was coming on rapidly; so he rose, at last, and went over to\r\nthe drift-wood.  Here, after a search of about half an hour, he found\r\nsomething which was very well suited to his purpose.  It was a piece of\r\nscantling about twenty feet long, and not very thick; and to this he\r\nsaw that he could fasten the pole that he had made up in the woods.\r\nThese two pieces would make, when joined, a very good flag-staff.\r\nThese he brought up to the bank.  Then he collected an armful of dry\r\nchips and sticks, which he carried over to a spot near where the boat\r\nlay.  A rock was there, and against one side of this he built a pile of\r\nthe chips.  He then tried a match, and found that it was quite dry, and\r\nlighted it without any difficulty.  With this he kindled the fire, and\r\nsoon saw, with great satisfaction, a bright and cheerful blaze.\r\n\r\nHe was so delighted with the fire that he brought up a dozen more loads\r\nof wood, which he laid near.  Then he drew up the bit of scantling, and\r\nbringing the coil of rope, he cut a piece off, and proceeded to fasten\r\nto the scantling the pole which he had procured in the woods.  He did\r\nthis by winding the rope around in a close and even wind; and, finally,\r\non concluding his task, he found that it was bound firmly enough to\r\nstand any breeze.  It took a long time to finish this; but Tom had\r\nslept late in the morning, and, though fatigued, he was not sleepy.\r\nAfter this he sat down in front of the fire, and enjoyed its friendly\r\nlight and its genial glow.  He kept heaping on the fuel, and the bright\r\nflames danced up, giving to him the first approach to anything like the\r\nfeeling of comfort that he had known since he had drifted away from the\r\nAntelope.  Nor was it comfort only that he was mindful of while he\r\nwatched and fed the fire.  He saw in this fire, as it shone out over\r\nthe water, the best kind of a signal, and had some hope of being seen\r\nand hailed by some passing vessel.  In this hope he sat up till\r\nmidnight, looking out from time to time over the water, and expecting\r\nevery instant to see the shadow of some approaching vessel.\r\n\r\nBut midnight came, and Tom at length thought of sleep.  The sail had\r\ndried thoroughly through the day; so now he used it once more as a\r\ncoverlet, and, folding himself in it, he reclined, as before, against\r\nthe mossy bank, and slept.\r\n\r\nOn awaking the next day, he arose and looked around.  To his deep\r\ndisappointment, he could see nothing.  There was a fog over all the\r\nscene.  The wind had changed, and his old enemy was once more besieging\r\nhim.  It was not so thick, indeed, as it had been, being light and dry,\r\nso that the ground was not at all moistened; but still the view was\r\nobscured, so that no vessel could be seen unless it came within half a\r\nmile; and that was rather closer than most vessels would care to come\r\nto his island.\r\n\r\nThis day was Sunday, and all Tom's plans had to be deferred until the\r\nfollowing day.  However, it was not at all disagreeable to him to get\r\nrid of the necessity of work; and, indeed, never before did he fully\r\nappreciate the nature of the Day of Rest.  The rest was sweet indeed to\r\nhis exhausted and overworn frame, and he did not go far away from his\r\nfire.  He had found some embers still glowing in the morning, and had\r\nkindled the fire anew from these, without drawing any more upon his\r\nprecious store of matches.  He resolved now to keep the coals alive all\r\nthe time, by feeding the fire during the day, and covering it up with\r\nashes by night.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday,--the Day of Rest,--and Tom felt all the blessedness of\r\nrest.  On the whole, it turned out to be the pleasantest day which he\r\nhad known since he left the schooner.  Left now to quiet reflection, he\r\nrecalled the events of the last week, and had more leisure to feel\r\nthankful over the wonderful safety which he had met with.  Even now on\r\nthe island he was not without his comforts.  He had food and warmth.\r\nSo, on the whole, though he had his moments of sadness, yet the sadness\r\nwas driven out by cheerfulness.  It was not all dismal.  The words of\r\nthat poem which is familiar to every school-boy rang in his ears:--\r\n\r\n      \"O, Solitude, where are the charms\r\n          That sages have seen in thy face?\r\n       Better dwell in the midst of alarms\r\n          Than reign in this horrible place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYet these words were accompanied and counterbalanced by the more\r\npleasing and consoling sentiments of others, which on this day accorded\r\nbetter with Tom's mood:--\r\n\r\n      \"There's mercy in every place;\r\n          And mercy--encouraging thought!--\r\n       Gives even affliction a grace,\r\n          And reconciles man to his lot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing occurred during the day to disturb the quiet of the island, and\r\nTom went to bed early that night, so as to have a long sleep, and\r\nfortify himself for the labors of the morrow.  The ashes were raked\r\ncarefully round the coals, which, when Tom waked in the morning, were\r\neasily kindled again.\r\n\r\nHe was up early on that Monday morning.  He saw, with deep\r\ndisappointment, that the fog still covered every thing, and that the\r\nwind was blowing quite brisk from the south-west, and raising rather a\r\nheavy sea.  But he had a great deal to do now, and to this he turned\r\nhis attention.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he had to finish his signal-staff and set it up.  He was\r\nvery much troubled about the proper material for a flag.  The canvas\r\nwas rather too heavy; but as he had nothing else, he had to take this.\r\nHe fastened a bit of the rope to the head of the staff, so as to form a\r\nloop, and through this he ran a piece which was long enough to serve\r\nfor halyards.  Thus far he had not used up more than a quarter of the\r\ncoil of rope; but he needed all that was left for other purposes.  The\r\nnext thing was to set up his staff. To do this required much labor.  He\r\nhad already selected the place which seemed most suitable.  It was at\r\nthe extreme point of a tongue of land which projected beside the brook,\r\nand only a little distance from his resting-place.  Here the ground was\r\nsoft; and choosing a sharp stone, he worked diligently for about a\r\ncouple of hours, until at length he succeeded in digging a hole which\r\nwas about eighteen inches in depth.  Then he fastened ropes to the\r\nstaff, where the pole joined it, so that four lines came down far\r\nenough to serve as stays.  Having done this, he inserted the end of the\r\nstaff in the hole, and thrust in the earth all around it, trampling it\r\nin, and beating it down as tight as he could with a stone.  After this\r\nhe procured some sticks from the drift-wood, and, sharpening the ends,\r\nhe secured the stays by fastening them to these sticks, which he drove\r\ninto the ground.  The staff then seemed to be as secure as was\r\nnecessary.  It only remained now to hoist up his flag; and this he did\r\nwithout any difficulty, securing it at half mast, so that it might\r\nserve unmistakably as a signal of distress.\r\n\r\nUpon completing this, Tom rested on the mound, and from that distance\r\nhe contemplated the signal with a great deal of calm and quiet\r\nsatisfaction.  It was his own device, and his own handiwork, and he was\r\nvery proud of it.  But he did not allow himself a long rest.  There yet\r\nremained much to be done, and to this he now directed his attention.\r\n\r\nHe had been thinking, during his last employment, upon the necessity\r\nwhich he had of some shelter.  A plan had suggested itself which he\r\nfelt confident that he could carry into execution without any very\r\ngreat trouble.  The fog that now prevailed, and which was far different\r\nfrom the light mist of the previous day, accompanied also, as it was,\r\nby the damp south-west wind, made some sort of a shelter imperatively\r\nnecessary, and that, too, before another night.  To pass this night in\r\nthe fog would be bad enough; but if it should happen to rain also, his\r\nsituation would be miserable indeed.\r\n\r\nHe now set out for the beach, and found, without much difficulty, some\r\npieces of wood which were necessary to his purpose.  Bringing these\r\nback, he next looked about for a good situation.  There was a rock not\r\nfar from the fire, and in front of this was a smooth spot, where the\r\nland was flat, and covered with short grass.  On the left it sloped to\r\nthe brook.  This seemed to him to be the best place on the island.  It\r\nwas sufficiently sheltered.  It was dry, and in case of rain the water\r\nwould not be likely to flood it.  With all these it also possessed the\r\nadvantage of being sufficiently conspicuous to any passing vessel which\r\nmight be attracted by the signal-staff.  Here, then, Tom determined to\r\nerect his place of residence.\r\n\r\nHis first work was to select two long and slender pieces of wood, and\r\nsharpen the ends of them.  Then he drove each of them into the ground\r\nin such a way that their tops crossed one another.  These he bound fast\r\ntogether.  Two other stakes were driven into the ground, and secured in\r\nthe same way, about six or seven feet off.  Another long piece of\r\nscantling was then placed so as to pass from one to the other of the\r\ntwo crossed sticks, so that it rested upon them. This last was bound\r\ntight to the crossed sticks, and thus the whole structure formed a\r\ncamp-shaped frame.\r\n\r\nOver this Tom now threw the sail, and brought it down to the ground on\r\neither side, securing it there with pegs.  At the back of the camp a\r\npiece of the sail was folded over and secured so as to cover it in;\r\nwhile in front another piece of the sail hung down until it nearly\r\nreached the ground.  This could hang down at night, and be folded over\r\nthe top by day.  Tom now tore up some sods, and laid them over the edge\r\nof the canvas on each side, where it touched the ground, and placed on\r\nthese heavy stones, until at length it seemed sufficiently protected\r\nfrom the entrance of any rain that might flow down the roof.  His last\r\ntask consisted in collecting a large quantity of moss and ferns from\r\nthe woods, which he strewed over the ground inside, and heaped up at\r\none end, so as to form a soft and fragrant bed.  When this was\r\naccomplished the camp was finished.\r\n\r\nIt had taken a long time, and when at last the work was done, it began\r\nto grow dark.  Tom noticed this with surprise.  He had been working so\r\nincessantly that he was not mindful of the flight of time, and now the\r\nday was done, and the evening was upon him before he was aware.  But\r\nthere were other things still for him to do before he could rest from\r\nhis labors.  His fire was just flickering around its last embers, and\r\nif he wished to have a pleasant light to cheer the solitude and the\r\ndarkness of his evening hours, it would be necessary to prepare a\r\nsupply of fuel.  To this he attended at once, and brought up several\r\narmfuls of drift-wood from the beach.  Placing these near the fire, he\r\nkindled it up afresh, and flung upon the rising flames a generous\r\nsupply of fuel.  The fires caught at it, and crackled as they spread\r\nthrough the dry wood, and tossed up their forked tongues on high, till\r\nin the dusk of evening they illuminated the surrounding scene with a\r\npleasant light.  A few more armfuls were added, and then the work for\r\nthe day was over.  That work had been very extensive and very\r\nimportant.  It had secured a means of communication with the outer\r\nworld, and had also formed a shelter from the chill night air, the fog,\r\nand the storm.  It was with a very natural pride that Tom cast his eyes\r\naround, and surveyed the results of his ingenuity and his industry.\r\n\r\nThe camp opened towards the fire, from which it was not so far distant\r\nbut that Tom could attend to it without any very great inconvenience.\r\nThe fire shone pleasantly before him as he sat down at his evening\r\nrepast.  As the darkness increased, it threw a ruddier glow upon all\r\nthe scene around, lighting up field and hill, and sending long streams\r\nof radiance into the fog that overhung the sea.  Tom had prepared an\r\nunusually large supply of fuel, this evening, for the express purpose\r\nof burning it all up; partly for his own amusement, and partly in the\r\nhope that it might meet the eyes of some passing navigator.  It was his\r\nonly hope.  To keep his signals going by night and day was the surest\r\nplan of effecting a speedy escape.  Who could tell what might be out on\r\nthe neighboring sea?  How did he know but that the Antelope might be\r\nsomewhere near at hand, with his companions on board, cruising\r\nanxiously about in search after the missing boat?  He never ceased to\r\nthink that they were following after him somewhere, and to believe\r\nthat, in the course of their wanderings, they might come somewhere\r\nwithin sight of him.  He knew that they would never give him up till\r\nthey assuredly knew his fate, but would follow after him, and set other\r\nvessels on the search, till the whole bay, with all its shores and\r\nislands, should be thoroughly ransacked.\r\n\r\nFortunate was it for him, he thought, that there was so large a supply\r\nof drift-wood at hand on the beach, dry, portable, and in every way\r\nconvenient for use.  Thanks to this, he might now disperse the gloom of\r\ndark and foggy nights, and keep up a better signal in the dark than he\r\ncould do in the light.  Thus the fuel was heaped on, and the fire\r\nflamed up, and Tom sat near, looking complacently upon the brilliant\r\nglow.\r\n\r\nThus far, for nearly a week, he had fed on biscuit only; but now, as he\r\nate his repast, he began to think that it was a very monotonous fare,\r\nand to wonder whether it might not be possible to find something which\r\ncould give a zest to his repasts.  The biscuit were holding out well,\r\nbut still he felt a desire to husband his resources, and if any\r\nadditional food could in any way be procured, it would not only be a\r\nrelish, but would also lessen his demand upon his one sole source of\r\nsupply.  He thought earnestly upon the subject of fish.  He turned his\r\nthoughts very seriously to the subject of fish-hooks, and tried to\r\nthink of some way by which he could capture some of the fish with which\r\nthese waters abounded. But this idea did not seem to promise much.  In\r\nthe first place, he could think of no possible way in which he could\r\nprocure any serviceable hook; in the second place, even if he had a\r\nhook and line all ready and baited, he did not see how he would be able\r\nto cast it within reach of any fish.  His boat would not float him even\r\nfor the little distance that was required to get into the places where\r\nfish might be.  He could only stand upon the beach out of their reach.\r\n\r\nBut, in the course of his thoughts, he soon perceived that other\r\nsources of food were possible to him besides the fish that were caught\r\nby hook and line.  His mind reverted to the populous realm of\r\nshell-fish.  These were all before him.  Round the rocks and amid the\r\nsea-weed there certainly must be mussels.  At low tide, amid the ledges\r\nand the sand, there surely must be some lobsters. Before him there was\r\nan extensive mud flat, where there ought to be clams.  Here was his\r\nfire, always ready, by night and by day.  Why should he not be able to\r\nmake use of that fire, not only for cheering his mind, and giving him\r\nwarmth, and signaling to passers-by, but also for cooking his meals?\r\n\r\nThis was the question that he asked himself as he ate his biscuit. He\r\ncould not see why he should not be able to accomplish this.  As far as\r\nhe could see, there ought to be plenty of shell-fish of various kinds\r\non these shores.  The more he thought of it, the more probable it\r\nseemed.  He determined to solve the difficulty as soon as possible.  On\r\nformer occasions he had arranged his work on the evening for the\r\nsucceeding day.  On this evening he marked out this work for the\r\nmorrow, and arranged in his mind a comprehensive and most diligent\r\nsearch for shell-fish, which should embrace the whole circuit of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nWith this in his mind, he arranged the fire as usual, so as to keep it\r\nalive, and then retired to his camp for the night.  The presence of a\r\nroof over his head was grateful in the extreme.  He let down the canvas\r\nfolds over the entrance, and felt a peculiar sense of security and\r\ncomfort.  The moss and ferns which he had heaped up were luxuriously\r\nsoft and deliciously fragrant.  Over these he stretched his wearied\r\nlimbs with a sigh of relief, and soon was asleep.\r\n\r\nSo comfortable was his bed, and so secure his shelter, that he slept\r\nlonger than usual.  It was late when he awaked.  He hurried forth and\r\nlooked around.  The fog still rested over everything.  If possible it\r\nwas thicker and more dismal than even on the preceding day.  To his\r\nsurprise, he soon noticed that it had been raining quite heavily\r\nthrough the night.  Around, in many places, he saw pools of water, and\r\nin the hollows of the rocks he saw the same. This could only have been\r\ndone by the rain.  Going back to his camp, he saw that the canvas was\r\nquite wet.  And yet the rain had all rolled off.  Not a drop had\r\nentered.  The moss and the fern inside were perfectly dry, and he had\r\nnot the slightest feeling of dampness about him.  His camp was a\r\ncomplete success.\r\n\r\nHe now went off to search for clams.  The tide had been high at about\r\nsix in the morning.  It was now, as he judged, about ten or eleven, and\r\nthe water was quite low.  Selecting a piece of shingle from his\r\nwood-pile, he walked down over the mud flat that extended from the\r\npoint, and, after going a little distance, he noticed the holes that\r\ngive indications of the presence of clams beneath. Turning up the sand,\r\nhe soon threw out some of them.  He now dug in several different\r\nplaces, and obtained sufficient for the day. These he carried back to\r\nthe bank in triumph.  Then he stirred up his fire, heaped on plenty of\r\nwood, and arranged his clams in front so as to roast them.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Mrs. Pratt's theories, the clams were found by Tom to be\r\ndelicious, and gave such relish to the biscuit, that he began to think\r\nwhether he could not make use of the baling dipper, and make a clam\r\nchowder.\r\n\r\nThis breakfast was a great success, and Tom now confidently expected to\r\nfind other shell-fish, by means of which his resources might be\r\nenlarged and improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nSolomon's solemn Tale.--A costly Lobster.--Off again.--Steam Whistles\r\nof all Sizes.--A noisy Harbor.--Arrival Home.--No News.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shout of joy uttered by those on the top of the cliff at seeing old\r\nSolomon safe was responded to by those in the boat; and then, as the\r\nlatter went on her way, Captain Corbet set out to return to the beach,\r\nfollowed by Phil and Pat.  Soon they were all reunited, and, the boat\r\nbeing landed, they returned in triumph to the Antelope.\r\n\r\nOn their way back, Solomon told them the story of his adventures.\r\n\r\n\"Went out,\" said he, \"on a splorin scursion, cos I was termined to try\r\nan skewer somethin to make a dinnah to keep up de sperrit ob dis yah\r\nparty.  Ben trouble nuff, an dat's no reason why we should all starb.\r\nI tought by de looks ob tings dar was lobstas somewhar long dis yah\r\nsho, an if I got a chance, I knowed I could get 'em. Dar was lots ob\r\ntime too, ef it hadn't ben fur dat ar pint; dat's what knocked me.\r\nLots o' lobstas--could hab picked up a barl full, ony hadn't any barl\r\nto pick up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but how did you happen to get caught?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat ar's jes what I'm a comin to.  You see, I didn't tink ob dat ar\r\npint when I went up de sho,--but knowed I had lots ob time; so I jes\r\ntought I'd make sure ob de best ob de lobstas.  Wan't goin to take back\r\nany common lobstas,--bet you dat,--notin for me but de best,--de bery\r\nbest ones dar.  Dat ar's what kep me.  It takes a heap ob time an car\r\nto get de best ones, when dar's a crowd lyin about ob all sizes, an de\r\nwater comin in too.\"\r\n\r\n\"But didn't you see that the tide was coming up to the point?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nebber see a see,--not a see; lookin ober de lobstas all de time, an\r\nmos stracted wid plexity cos I couldn't cide bout de best ones. Dar was\r\nlots an lots up dar at one place, dough I didn't go fur,--but ef I'd\r\ngone fur, I'd hab got better ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far did you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not fur,--ony short distance,--didn't want to go too fur away for feah\r\nob not gittin back in time.  An so I started to come back pooty soon,\r\nan walked, an walked.  Las, jes as I got to de pint, I rose my ole\r\nhead, an looked straight afore me, an thar, clar ef I didn't fine\r\nmyself shut in,--reglar prison,--mind I tell you,--an all round me a\r\nreglar cumferince ob water an rock, widout any way ob scape.  Tell you\r\nwhat, if dar ebber was a ole rat in a trap, I was at dat ar casion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you have waded through it before it got too high?\"\r\n\r\n\"Waded?  Not a wade; de water was rough an deep, an de bottom was\r\nstones dat I'd slipped oba an almost broke my ole head, sides bein\r\ndrownded as dead as a herrin.  Why, what you tink dis ole nigga's made\r\nob?  I'm not a steam injine, nor a mowin machine, nor a life boat.  I'm\r\nony a ole man, an shaky in de legs too,--mind I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how did you manage it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Manage!  Why, I didn't manage at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you find that place where you were sitting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't settin.  I was tied up in a knot, or rolled up into a ball. Any\r\nway, I wasn't settin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how did you find the place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I jes got up dar.  I stood on de sho till de water drobe me, an I\r\nkep out ob its way till at las I found myself tied up de way you saw\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you halloo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hollar?  Didn't I hollar like all possessed?\"\r\n\r\n\"We didn't hear you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, dat ar's dredful sterious.  An me a hollarin an a yellin like\r\nmad.  Tell you what, I felt as ef I'd bust my ole head open, I did yell\r\nthat hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you manage to climb up that cliff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat cliff?  Climb up?  Me?  What! me climb up a cliff? an dat cliff?\r\nWhy, I couldn't no more climb up dat ar cliff dan I could fly to de\r\nmoon.  No, sah.  Much as I could do to keep whar I was, out ob de\r\nwater.  Dat was enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know that we walked two miles up the shore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two miles!  Two!  De sakes, now, chil'en! did you, railly?  Ef I'd a\r\nony knowed you war a comin so near, wouldn't I a yelled?  I bet I\r\nwould.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you didn't think we'd have left you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lef me?  Nebber.  But den I didn't tink you'd magine anyting was wrong\r\ntill too late.  What I wanted was help, den an dar.  De trouble was,\r\nwhen you did come, you all made dat ar circumbendibus, an trabelled\r\nclean an clar away from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We thought at first you could not be so near the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"But de pint was de whole difficulty.  Dat's de pint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, at any rate, you've saved the lobsters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yah! yah! yah!  Yes.  Bound to sabe dem dar.  Loss my ole hat, an\r\nnearly loss my ole self; but still I hung on to dem dar lobstas. Tell\r\nyou what it is now, dey come nigh onto bein de dearest lobstas you\r\nebber eat.  I'be done a good deal in de way ob puttin myself out to get\r\na dinna at odd times for you, chil'en; but dis time I almost put myself\r\nout ob dis mortial life.  So when you get your dinnas to-day, you may\r\ntink on what dat ar dinna come nigh to costin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder that you held on to them so tight, when they brought you into\r\nsuch danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hole on?  Why, dat ar's de berry reason why I did hole on.  What, let\r\ngo ob dem arter all my trouble on dat count?  No.  I was bound to hab\r\nsomethin to show whenebber I got back, if I ebber did get back; and so\r\nhere I am, all alibe, an a bringin my lobstas wid me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Solomon,\" said Bart, in a kindly tone, \"old man, the lobsters\r\nhave come near costing us pretty dear, and we felt bad enough, I can\r\ntell you, when we went up there along the shore calling for you and\r\ngetting no answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, you did car for de ole man, Mas'r Bart--did you?\" said Solomon,\r\nin a tremulous voice.  Tears started to his eyes as he said it, and all\r\npower of saying anything more seemed to depart from him.  He fell back\r\nbehind the others, and walked on for the rest of the way in silence,\r\nbut at times casting upon Bart glances that spoke volumes, and talking\r\nto himself in inaudible tones.\r\n\r\nIn this way they soon reached the wharf where the schooner was lying.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that they noticed was, that the schooner was aground.\r\nThe tide had gone out too far for her to float away, and consequently\r\nthere was no hope of resuming their voyage for that day.\r\n\r\n\"We're in for it, captain,\" said Bruce\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I felt afeard of it,\" said the captain.  \"We've got to wait here\r\ntill the next tide.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll leave to-night, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes.  We must get off at the night's tide, and drop down the bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far had we better go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I ben a thinkin it all over, an it's my opinion that we'd better\r\ngo to St. John next.  We may hear of him there, an ef he don't turn up\r\nwe can send out some more vessels, an give warnin that he's astray on\r\nthe briny biller.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what time will we be able to leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, it'll not be high tide till near one o'clock, but we can git off\r\nef thar's a wind a leetle before midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the wind will hold on?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain raised his head, and looked at the sky; then he looked out\r\nto sea, and then he remained silent for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" said he, at last, slowly and thoughtfully, \"it'll take a man\r\nwith a head as long as a hoss to answer that thar.  It mought hold on,\r\nan then agin it moughtn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, I suppose we can drift.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes; an of the wind doosn't come round too strong, we can git nigh\r\ndown pooty close to St. John by mornin.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll run down with the tide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Percisely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose we'll have to put the time through the best way we\r\ncan, and try to be patient.  Only it seems hard to be delayed so much.\r\nFirst there was the fog, which made our search useless; and now, when\r\nthere comes a bright day, when we can see where we're going, here we\r\nare tied up in Quaco all day and all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doos seem hard,\" said Captain Corbet, gravely, \"terrible hard; an\r\nef I owned a balloon that could rise this here vessel off the ground,\r\nan convey her through the air to her nat'ral element, I'd hev it done\r\nin five minutes, an we'd all proceed to walk the waters like things of\r\nlife.  But I don't happen to own a balloon, an so thar you air.\r\n\r\n\"But, boys,\" continued the captain, in a solemn voice, elevating his\r\nvenerable chin, and regarding them with a patriarchal smile,--\"boys,\r\ndon't begin to go on in that thar old despondent strain. Methinks I\r\nhear some on you a repinin, an a frettin, cos we're stuck here hard an\r\nfast.  Don't do it, boys; take my advice, an don't do it.  Bear in mind\r\nthe stirrin an memiorable events of this here mornin.  See what a\r\ncalamity was a threatenin us.  Why, I declare to you all, thar was a\r\ntime when I expected to see our aged friend Solomon no more in the\r\nflesh.  You could not tell it by my manner, for I presarved a calm an\r\ncollected dumeanour; but yet, I tell you, underneath all that icy calm\r\nan startlin good-natur of my attitood, I concealed a heart that bet\r\nwith dark despair.  At that moment, when we in our wanderins had\r\nreached the furthest extremity that we attained onto, I tell you my\r\nblood friz, an my har riz in horror!  Methought it were all up with\r\nSolomon; and when I see his hat, it seemed to me jest as though I was a\r\nregardin with despairin eye his tumestun whereon war graven by no\r\nmortial hand the solemn an despairin epigram, 'Hic jacet!'\r\n\r\n\"So now, my friends,\" continued the captain, as he brushed a tear-drop\r\nfrom his eye, \"let us conterrol our feelins.  Let us be calm, and hope\r\nfor the best.  When Solomon took his departoor, an was among the\r\nmissin, I thought that an evil fortin was a berroodin over us, and\r\nabout to consume us.  But that derream air past. Solomon is onst more\r\namong the eatables.  He cooks agin the mortial repast.  He lives!  So\r\nit will be with our young friend who has so mysteriously drifted away\r\nfrom our midst.  Cheer up, I say!  Them's my sentiment.  He'll come to,\r\nan turn up, all alive--right side up--with care,--C. O. D.,--O. K.,--to\r\nbe shaken before taken,--marked and numbered as per margin,--jest as\r\nwhen shipped, in good order an condition, on board the schooner\r\nAntelope, Corbet master, of Grand Pre.\"\r\n\r\nThese words of Captain Corbet had a very good effect upon the boys.\r\nThey had already felt very much cheered by the escape of Solomon, and\r\nit seemed to them to be a good omen.  If Solomon had escaped, so also\r\nmight Tom.  And, as their anxiety on Solomon's account had all been\r\ndispelled by his restoration, so also might they hope that their\r\nanxiety about Tom would be dispelled.  True, he had been lost to them\r\nfor a much longer time, and his absence was certainly surrounded by a\r\nmore terrible obscurity than any which had been connected with that of\r\nSolomon.  Yet this one favorable circumstance served to show them that\r\nall might not be so dark as they had feared.  Thus, therefore, they\r\nbegan to be more sanguine, and to hope that when they reached St. John,\r\nsome tidings of the lost boy might be brought to them.\r\n\r\nSolomon's exertions towards giving them a dinner were on this day\r\ncrowned with greater success than had been experienced for some days\r\npast.  Their exertions had given them an appetite, and they were able\r\nto eat heartily for the first time since Tom's departure.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day passed very slowly with them.  They retired early,\r\nand slept until midnight.  At that time they waked, and went on deck,\r\nwhen they had the extreme satisfaction of seeing the vessel get under\r\nway.  A moderate breeze was blowing, which was favorable, and though\r\nthe tide was not yet in their favor, yet the wind was sufficient to\r\nbear them out into the bay.  Then the boys all went below again, full\r\nof hope.  The night passed away quietly, and without any incident\r\nwhatever.  They all slept soundly, and the dreams that came to them\r\nwere pleasant rather than otherwise.\r\n\r\nAwaking in the morning by daylight, they all hurried up on deck, and\r\nencountered there a new disappointment; for all around them they saw\r\nagain the hated presence of the fog.  The wind also had died away, and\r\nthe vessel's sails flapped idly against her masts.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we now?\" asked Bruce, in a despondent tone.\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" said Captain Corbet, \"as nigh as I can reckon, we're two or\r\nthree miles outside of St. John harbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is the tide?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, it's kine o' agin us, jest now.\"\r\n\r\n\"There doesn't seem to be any wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we get into St. John to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I kine o' think we'll manage it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, not much afore midday.  You see we're driftin away jest now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you intend to anchor till the next rise of tide?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes; in about ten minutes we'd ought to be about whar I want to\r\nanchor.\"\r\n\r\nAt this disheartening condition of affairs the boys sank once more into\r\na state of gloom.  In about ten minutes, as Captain Corbet said, the\r\nschooner was at anchor, and there was nothing to do but to wait.\r\n\r\n\"We'll run in at turn o' tide,\" said he.\r\n\r\nBreakfast came, and passed.  The meal was eaten in silence.  Then they\r\nwent on deck again, fretting and chafing at the long delay. Not much\r\nwas said, but the boys stood in silence, trying to see through the\r\nthick fog.\r\n\r\n\"It was so fine when we left,\" said Bart, \"that I thought we'd have it\r\nall the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, so we did--pooty much all; but then, you see, about four this\r\nmornin we run straight into a fog bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the wind changed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, thar don't seem jest now to be any wind to speak of, but it kine\r\no' strikes me that it's somethin like southerly weather. Hence this\r\nhere fog.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours the vessel began to get under way again; and now,\r\ntoo, there arose a light breeze, which favored them.  As they went on\r\nthey heard the long, regular blast of a steam whistle, which howled out\r\na mournful note from time to time.  Together with this, they heard,\r\noccasionally, the blasts of fog horns from unseen schooners in their\r\nneighborhood, and several times they could distinguish the rush of some\r\nsteamer past them, whose whistle sounded sharply in their ears.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer, these varied sounds became louder, and at length\r\nthe yell of one giant whistle sounded close beside them.\r\n\r\n\"We're a enterin o' the harbure,\" said Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\nHours passed away from the time the Antelope raised anchor until she\r\nreached the wharf.  In passing up the harbor, the shadowy forms of\r\nvessels at anchor became distinguishable amid the gloom, and in front\r\nof them, as they neared the wharf, there arose a forest of masts\r\nbelonging to schooners.  It was now midday.  Suddenly there arose a\r\nfearful din all around.  It was the shriek of a large number of steam\r\nwhistles, and seemed to come up from every side.\r\n\r\n\"Is that for the fog?\" asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n\"O, no,\" said Bart; \"those are the saw-mills whistling for twelve\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys had already completed their preparations for landing, and had\r\nchanged their eccentric clothing for apparel which was more suited to\r\nmaking their appearance in society.  Bart had insisted that they should\r\ngo to his house, and wait until they might decide what to do; and the\r\nboys had accepted his hospitable invitation.\r\n\r\nThey stepped on shore full of hope, not doubting that they would hear\r\nnews of Tom.  They had persuaded themselves that he had been picked up\r\nby some vessel which was coming down the bay, and had probably been put\r\nashore here; in which case they knew that he would at once communicate\r\nwith Bart's people.  They even thought that Tom would be there to\r\nreceive them.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he will be,\" said Bart; \"if he did turn up, they'd make him\r\nstay at the house, you know; and he'd know that we fellows would come\r\ndown here in the hope of hearing about him.  So we'll find him there\r\nall right, after all.  Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nBut, on reaching his home, Bart's joyous meeting with his family was\r\nvery much marred by the deep, dark, and bitter disappointment that\r\nawaited him and his companions.\r\n\r\nThey knew nothing whatever about Tom.  Bart's father was shocked at the\r\nstory.  He knew that no boy had been picked up adrift in the bay during\r\nthe past week.  Such an event would have been known.  He felt\r\nexceedingly anxious, and at once instituted a search among the coasting\r\nvessels.  The search was a thorough one, but resulted in nothing.\r\nThere was no one who had seen anything of a drifting boat.  All\r\nreported thick fog in the bay.\r\n\r\nThe result of this search plunged Bart and his friends into their\r\nformer gloom.\r\n\r\nOther searches were made.  Inquiries were sent by telegraph to\r\ndifferent places, but without result.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the missing boy now became a serious question\r\n\r\nAs for Bart and his friends, they were inconsolable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nDown the Bay.--Drifting and Anchoring.--In the Dark, morally and\r\nphysically.--Eastport, the jumping-off Place.--Grand Manan.--Wonderful\r\nSkill.--Navigating in the Fog.--A Plunge from Darkness into Light, and\r\nfrom Light into Darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday when Bart reached home.  As much was done on that day\r\nas possible.  Bart was in the extreme of wretchedness, and so eager was\r\nhe to resume the search for his friend, that his father gave his\r\npermission for him to start off again in the Antelope. The other boys\r\nalso were to go with him.  They determined to scour the seas till they\r\nfound Tom, or had learned his fate.\r\n\r\nMr. Damer also assured Bart that he would take the matter in hand\r\nhimself, and would send out two schooners to go about the bay.  In\r\naddition to this, he would telegraph to different places, so that the\r\nmost extensive search possible might be instituted.  Every part of the\r\ncoast should be explored, and even the islands should be visited.\r\n\r\nAll this gave as much consolation to Bart and his friends as it was\r\npossible for them to feel under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nAs much as possible was done on Saturday, but the next day was an idle\r\none, as far as the search was concerned.  Bart and the boys waited with\r\ngreat impatience, and finally on Monday morning they left once more in\r\nthe Antelope.  It was about five o'clock in the morning, the tide was\r\nin their favor, and, though there was a head wind, yet be fore the turn\r\nof tide they were anchored a good distance down the bay.\r\n\r\n\"My idee is this,\" said Captain Corbet.  \"I'll explore the hull bay in\r\nsearch of that driftin boy.  I'll go down this side, cross over, and\r\ncome up on t'other.  We'll go down here first, an not cross over till\r\nwe get as fur as Quoddy Head.  I think, while we air down thar, I'll\r\ncall at Eastport an ask a few questions.  But I must say it seems a\r\nleetle too bad to have the fog go on this way.  If this here had ony\r\nhappened a fortnight ago, we'd have had clear weather an fair winds.\r\nIt's too bad, I declar.\"\r\n\r\nThey took advantage of the next tide to go down still farther, and by\r\ntwelve o'clock on Monday night they were far down.  Since leaving St.\r\nJohn they had seen nothing whatever, but they had heard occasionally\r\nthe fog horns of wandering schooners, and once they had listened to the\r\nyell of a steamer's whistle.\r\n\r\n\"I've allus said,\" remarked Captain Corbet, \"that in navigatin this\r\nhere bay, tides is more important than winds, and anchors is more\r\nimportant than sails.  That's odd to seafarin men that ain't acquainted\r\nwith these waters, but it air a oncontrovartible fact. Most of the\r\ndistressin casooalties that happen hereabouts occur from a ignorance of\r\nthis on the part of navigators.  They WILL pile on sail.  Now, in clar\r\nweather an open sea, pile it on, I say; but in waters like these,\r\nwhar's the use?  Why, it's flyin clar in the face of Providence.  Now\r\nlook at me--do I pile on sail?  Not me. Catch me at it!  When I can git\r\nalong without, why, I git.  At the same time, I don't think you'll find\r\nit altogether for the good of your precious health, boys, to be a movin\r\nabout here in the fog at midnight.  Better go below.  You can't do no\r\ngood a settin or a standin up here, squintin through a darkness that\r\nmight be felt, an that's as thick as any felt I ever saw.  So take my\r\nadvice, an go below, and sleep it off.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to gainsay the truth of Captain Corbet's remarks, and\r\nas it was really midnight, and the darkness almost as thick as he said,\r\nthe boys did go below, and managed to get to sleep in about a minute\r\nand a half after their heads touched the pillows.\r\n\r\nBefore they were awake on the following day the anchor was hoisted, and\r\nthe Antelope was on her way again.\r\n\r\n\"Here we air, boys,\" said the captain, as they came on deck, \"under\r\nway--the Antelope on her windin way over the mounting wave, a\r\nbereasting of the foamin biller like all possessed.  I prophesy for\r\nthis day a good time as long as the tide lasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think we'll get to Eastport harbor with this tide?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I think so?--I know it.  I feel it down to my butes.  Eastport\r\nharbure?  Yea!  An arter that we hev all plain-sailin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, won't the fog last?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't car for the fog.  Arter we get to Eastport harbure we cease\r\ngoin down the bay.  We then cross over an steal up the other side.\r\nThen it's all our own.  If the fog lasts, why, the wind'll last too, an\r\nwe can go up flyin, all sails set; an I'll remuve from my mind, for the\r\ntime bein, any prejudyce that I have agin wind at sails.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you intend to go ashore at Eastport?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for a short time--jest to make inquiries.  It will be a\r\nconsolation, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll up sail, an away we'll go, irrewspective of tides, across\r\nthe bay.\"\r\n\r\nBy midday the captain informed them that they were in Eastport harbor.\r\n\r\n\"See thar,\" said he, as he pointed to a headland with a light-house.\r\n\"That thar is the entrance.  They do call this a pootyish place; but as\r\nit's this thick, you won't hev much chance to see it. Don't you want to\r\ngo ashore an walk about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if we can help it.  Of course we'll have to ask after poor Tom,\r\nbut we haven't any curiosity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, p'aps not--ony thar is people that find this a dreadful cur'ous\r\nplace.  It's got, as I said, a pootyish harbure; but that ain't the\r\ngrand attraction.  The grand attraction centres in a rock that's said\r\nto be the eastest place in the neighborin republic,--in short, as they\r\ncall it, the 'jumpin-off place.'  You'd better go an see it; ony you\r\nneedn't jump off, unless you like.\"\r\n\r\nSailing up the harbor, the fog grew light enough for them to see the\r\nshore.  The town lay in rather an imposing situation, on the side of a\r\nhill, which was crowned by a fort.  A large number of vessels lay about\r\nat the wharves and at anchor.  Here they went ashore in a boat, but on\r\nmaking inquiries could gain no information about Tom; nor could they\r\nlearn anything which gave them the slightest encouragement.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to wait here a while so as to devarsefy the time. Suppose we\r\ngo an jump off?\" said the captain.\r\n\r\nThe boys assented to this in a melancholy manner, and the captain led\r\nthe way through the town, till at last he halted at the extreme east\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said he, \"you behold the last extremity of a great an mighty\r\nnation, that spreads from the Atlantic to the Pacific, an from the Gulf\r\nof Mexiky to the very identical spot that you air now a occypyin of.\r\nIt air a celebrated spot, an this here air a memorable momient in your\r\nyouthful lives, if you did but know it!\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing very striking about this place, except the fact which\r\nCaptain Corbet had stated.  Its appearance was not very imposing, yet,\r\non the other hand, it was not without a certain wild beauty.  Before\r\nthem spread the waters of the bay, with islands half concealed in mist;\r\nwhile immediately in front, a steep, rocky bank went sheer down for\r\nsome thirty or forty feet to the beach below.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said the captain, \"that bein Pilgrims, it air our dooty to\r\njump; but as it looks a leetle rocky down thar, I think we'd best defer\r\nthat to another opportoonity.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to the schooner, they weighed anchor, set sail, and left the\r\nharbor.  On leaving it, they did not go back the way they had come, but\r\npassed through a narrow and very picturesque channel, which led them by\r\na much shorter route into the bay.  On their left were wooded hills,\r\nand on their right a little village on the slope of a hill, upon whose\r\ncrest stood a church.\r\n\r\nOutside the fog lay as thick as ever, and into this they plunged. Soon\r\nthe monotonous gray veil of mist closed all around them.  But now their\r\nprogress was more satisfactory, for they were crossing the bay, and the\r\nwind was abeam.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going straight across to Nova Scotia now?\" asked Bart.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, yes; kine o' straight across,\" was the reply; \"ony on our way\r\nwe've got to call at a certain place, an contenoo our investergations.\"\r\n\r\n\"What place is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the Island of Grand Manan--a place that I allers feel the\r\ngreatest respect for.  On that thar island is that celebrated fog mill\r\nthat I told you of, whar they keep grindin night an day, in southerly\r\nweather, so as to keep up the supply of fog for old Fundy.  Whatever\r\nwe'd do without Grand Manan is more'n I can say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the island inhabited?\" asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n\"Inhabited?  O, dear, yas.  Thar's a heap o' people thar.  It's jest\r\npossible that a driftin boat might git ashore thar, an ef so we'll know\r\npooty soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, ony about seven or eight mile.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll be there in an hour or so, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, not so soon.  You see, we've got to go round it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Around it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cos thar ain't any poppylation on this side, an we've got to land on\r\nt'other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are there no people on this side?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cos thar ain't no harbures.  The cliffs air six hundred feet high, and\r\nthe hull shore runs straight on for ever so fur without a break, except\r\ntwo triflin coves.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it on the other side?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, the east side ain't a bad place.  The shore is easier, an thar's\r\nharbures an anchorages.  Thar's a place they call Whale Cove, whar I'm\r\ngoin to land, an see if I can hear anythin.  The people air ony\r\nfishers, an they ain't got much cultivation; but it's mor'en likely\r\nthat a driftin boat might touch thar somewhar.\"\r\n\r\nThe Antelope pursued her course, but it was as much as three hours\r\nbefore she reached her destination.  They dropped anchor then, and\r\nlanded.  The boys had already learned not to indulge too readily in\r\nhope; but when they made their inquiries, and found the same answer\r\nmeeting them here which they had received in other places, they could\r\nnot avoid feeling a fresh pang of disappointment and discouragement.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, we didn't git much good out of this place,\" said Captain Corbet.\r\n\"I'm sorry that we have sech a arrand as ourn.  Ef it warn't for that\r\nwe could spend to-night here, an to-morry I'd take you all to see the\r\nfog mill; but, as it is, I rayther think I won't linger here, but\r\nperceed on our way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do we go next--to Nova Scotia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, not jest straight across, but kine o' slantin.  We head now for\r\nDigby; that's about straight opposite to St. John, an it's as likely a\r\nplace as any to make inquiries at.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will it be before we get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, some time to-morry mornin.  To-night we've got nothin at all to\r\ndo but to sweep through the deep while the stormy tempests blow in the\r\nshape of a mild sou-wester; so don't you begin your usual game of\r\nsettin up.  You ain't a mite of good to me, nor to yourselves, a stayin\r\nhere.  You'd ought all to be abed, and, ef you'll take my advice,\r\nyou'll go to sleep as soon as you can, an stay asleep as long as you\r\ncan.  It'll be a foggy night, an we won't see a mite o' sunshine till\r\nwe git into Digby harbure.  See now, it's already dark; so take my\r\nadvice, an go to bed, like civilized humane beings.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not need much persuasion to send them off to their beds. Night\r\nwas coming on, another night of fog and thick darkness.  This time,\r\nhowever, they had the consolation of making some progress, if it were\r\nany consolation when they had no definite course before them; for, in\r\nsuch a cruise as this, when they were roaming about from one place to\r\nanother, without any fixed course, or fixed time, the progress that\r\nthey made was, after all, a secondary consideration.  The matter of\r\nfirst importance was to hear news of Tom, and, until they did hear\r\nsomething, all other things were of little moment.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope continued on her way all that night, and on the next\r\nmorning the boys found the weather unchanged.  Breakfast passed, and\r\ntwo or three hours went on.  The boys were scattered about the decks,\r\nin a languid way, looking out over the water, when suddenly a cry from\r\nPat, who was in the bows, aroused all of them. Immediately before them\r\nrose a lofty shore, covered in the distance with dark trees, but\r\nterminating at the water's edge in frowning rocks.  A light-house stood\r\nhere, upon which they had come so suddenly that, before they were over\r\ntheir first surprise, they were almost near enough to toss a biscuit\r\nashore.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, now, I call that thar pooty slick sailin,\" exclaimed Captain\r\nCorbet, glancing at the lighthouse with sparkling eyes.  \"I tell you\r\nwhat it is, boys, you don't find many men in this here day an age that\r\ncan leave Manan at dusk, when the old fog mill is hard at work, and\r\ntravel all night in the thickest fog ever seen, with tide agin him half\r\nthe time, an steer through that thar fog, an agin that thar tide, so as\r\nto hit the light-house as slick as that. Talk about your scientific\r\nnavigation--wouldn't I like to see what one of them thar scientific\r\ncaptings would do with his vessel last night on sech a track as I run\r\nover!  Wouldn't I like to run a race with him? an ef I did, wouldn't I\r\nmake a pile to leave and bequeath to the infant when his aged parient\r\nair buried beneath the cold ground?\"\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Corbet was speaking, the schooner sailed past the\r\nlight-house, and the thick fog closed around her once more.  On one\r\nside, however, they could see the dim outline of the shore on their\r\nright.  On they sailed for about a quarter of a mile, when suddenly the\r\nfog vanished, and, with scarce a moment's notice, there burst upon them\r\na blaze of sunlight, while overhead appeared the glory of the blue sky.\r\nThe suddenness of that transition forced a cry of astonishment from\r\nall.  They had shot forth so quickly from the fog into the sunlight\r\nthat it seemed like magic.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves sailing along a strait about a mile in width,\r\nwith shores on each side that were as high as Blomidon.  On the right\r\nthe heights sloped up steep, and were covered with trees of rich dark\r\nverdure, while on the other side the slope was bolder and wilder.\r\nHouses appeared upon the shore, and roads, and cultivated trees.  This\r\nstrait was several miles in length, and led into a broad and\r\nmagnificent basin.\r\n\r\nHere, in this basin, appeared an enchanting view.  A sheet of water\r\nextended before their eyes about sixteen miles in length and five in\r\nbreadth.  All around were lofty shores, fertile, well tilled, covered\r\nwith verdurous trees and luxuriant vegetation.  The green of the shores\r\nwas dotted with white houses, while the blue of the water was flecked\r\nwith snowy sails.  Immediately on the right there appeared a circular\r\nsweep of shore, on which arose a village whose houses were intermingled\r\nwith green trees.\r\n\r\nInto this beautiful basin came the old French navigators more than two\r\ncenturies ago, and at its head they found a place which seemed to them\r\nthe best spot in Acadie to become the capital of the new colony which\r\nthey were going to found here.  So they established their little town,\r\nand these placid waters became the scene of commercial activity and of\r\nwarlike enterprise, till generations passed away, and the little French\r\ntown of Port Royal, after many strange vicissitudes, with its wonderful\r\nbasin, remained in the possession of the English conqueror.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Captain Corbet, \"boys, look round on that thar, an tell me\r\nof you ever see a beautifuller place than this.  Thar's ony one place\r\nthat can be compared with this here, an that's Grand Pre. But for the\r\nlife o' me, I never can tell which o' the two is the pootiest.  It's\r\nstrange, too, how them French fellers managed to pick out the best\r\nplaces in the hull province.  But it shows their taste an judgment--it\r\ndoos, railly.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the Antelope had dropped anchor in front of the\r\ntown of Digby, and Captain Corbet landed with the boys as soon as\r\npossible.  There was as good a chance of Tom being heard of here as\r\nanywhere; since this place lay down the bay, in one sense, and if by\r\nany chance Tom had drifted over to the Nova Scotia shore, as now seemed\r\nprobable, he would be not unlikely to go to Digby, so as to resume his\r\njourney, so rudely interrupted, and make his way thence to his friends.\r\n\r\nDigby is a quiet little place, that was finished long ago.  It was\r\nfirst settled by the Tory refugees, who came here after the\r\nrevolutionary war, and received land grants from the British\r\ngovernment.  At first it had some activity, but its business soon\r\nlanguished.  The first settlers had such bright hopes of its future\r\nthat they regularly laid out a town, with streets and squares.  But\r\nthese have never been used to any extent, and now appear grown over\r\nwith grass.  Digby, however, has so much beauty of scenery around it,\r\nthat it may yet attract a large population.  On landing here, Captain\r\nCorbet pursued the same course as at other places.  He went first to\r\none of the principal shops, or the post office, and told his story, and\r\nafterwards went to the schooners at the wharves. But at Digby there was\r\nprecisely the same result to their inquiries as there had been at other\r\nplaces.  No news had come to the place of any one adrift, nor had any\r\nskipper of any schooner noticed anything of the kind during his last\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\n\"What had we better do next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" said Captain Corbet, \"we can ony finish our cruise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Up the bay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I'll keep on past Ile Haute, an I'll cruise around Minas. You\r\nsee these drifts may take him in a'most any direction.  I don't see why\r\nhe shouldn't hev drifted up thar as well as down here.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Wednesday when they reached Digby.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of that day the Antelope weighed anchor, and sailed out\r\ninto the Bay of Fundy.\r\n\r\nIt was bright sunshine, with a perfectly cloudless sky inside, but\r\noutside the Antelope plunged into the midst of a dense and heavy fog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nTom's Devices.--Rising superior to Circumstances.--Roast Clams.--Baked\r\nLobster.--Boiled Mussels.--Boiled Shrimps.--Roast\r\nEggs.--Dandelions.--Ditto, with Eggs.--Roast\r\nDulse.--Strawberries.--Pilot-bread.--Strawberry Cordial.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another day had passed away on Ile Haute.\r\n\r\nWhen we last saw Tom he had succeeded in finding some clams, which he\r\nroasted in front of his fire, and made thus a very acceptable relish.\r\nThis not only gratified his palate for the time, but it also stimulated\r\nhim to fresh exertions, since it showed him that his resources were\r\nmuch more extensive than he had supposed them to be.  If he had ever\r\ndreaded getting out of all his provisions, he saw now that the fear was\r\nan unfounded one.  Here, before his eyes, and close beside his\r\ndwelling-place, there extended a broad field full of food.  In that mud\r\nflat there were clams enough to feed him for all the rest of his life,\r\nif that were necessary.  But what was more, he saw by this the\r\npossibility that other articles of food might be reckoned on, by means\r\nof which he would be able to relieve his diet from that monotony which\r\nhad thus far been its chief characteristic.  If he could find something\r\nelse besides clams and biscuit, the tedium of his existence here would\r\nbe alleviated to a still greater degree.\r\n\r\nHe spent some time in considering this subject, and in thinking over\r\nall the possible kinds of food which he might hope to obtain. Sea and\r\nland might both be relied on to furnish food for his table in the\r\ndesert.  The sea, he knew, ought to supply the following:--\r\n\r\n  1.  Clams,\r\n  2.  Lobsters,\r\n  3.  Mussels,\r\n\r\nin addition to other things which he had in his mind.  The land, on the\r\nother hand, ought to furnish something.  Now that his attention was\r\nfairly directed to this important subject, he could think of several\r\nthings which would be likely to be found even on this island, and the\r\nsearch for which would afford an agreeable amusement.\r\n\r\nThe more he thought of all this, the more astonished he was at the\r\nnumber of things which he could think of as being likely to exist here\r\naround him.  It was not so much for the sake of gratifying his\r\nappetite, as to find some occupation, that he now entered eagerly upon\r\nputting this new project into execution.  Fish, flesh, and fowl now\r\noffered themselves to his endeavors, and these were to be supplied by\r\nland, sea, and sky.  This sudden enlargement of his resources, and also\r\nof his sphere of operations, caused him to feel additional\r\nsatisfaction, together with a natural self-complacency. To the ordinary\r\nmind Ile Haute appeared utterly deserted and forlorn--a place where one\r\nmight starve to death, if he had to remain for any length of time; but\r\nTom now determined to test to the utmost the actual resources of the\r\nisland, so as to prove, to himself what one unaided boy could do, when\r\nthus thrown upon his own intelligent efforts, with dire necessity to\r\nact as a stimulus to his ingenuity.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, then, there was his box of biscuit, which he had brought\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nTo this must be added his first discovery on the island, namely, the\r\nclams.  Nothing could be of greater importance than this, since it\r\nafforded not merely a relish, but also actual food.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that he sought after was lobsters, and he went off in\r\nsearch of these as soon as he could on the following day.\r\n\r\nHe waited till the tide was low, which was at about twelve o'clock, and\r\nthen went down along the beach.  At high tide, the water came close up\r\nto the foot of the lofty cliff; but at ebb, it descended for some\r\ndistance, so that there was some sort of a beach even in places that\r\ndid not promise any.\r\n\r\nThe beach nearest to where Tom had taken up his abode was an expanse of\r\nmud and sand; but passing along beyond this, on the north side, it\r\nbecame gravelly.  About a hundred yards to the west, on this side of\r\nthe island, he came to the place where he had tied his boat, on that\r\neventful time when he had drifted here.  Below this, the beach extended\r\ndown for a long distance, and at the lowest point there were rocks, and\r\nsharp stones, and pebbles of every size.  Here Tom began his search,\r\nand before he had looked five minutes, he found several lobsters of\r\ngood size.  A little farther search showed him that there was a large\r\nsupply of these, so that, in fact, sufficient support might have been\r\nobtained for a whole ship's company.  By the time that he had found a\r\nhalf dozen of these, and had brought them back to his hearth-stone, it\r\nhad grown too dark to search for any more.  Tom's search, however, had\r\nbeen so successful, that he felt quite satisfied; and though the day\r\nhad passed without any change in the weather or any lifting of the fog,\r\nthough he had listened in vain for any sound over the waters which\r\nmight tell of passers by, though his signal had not been seen, and his\r\nbright burning fire had not been noticed, yet the occupation of thought\r\nand of action which he had found for himself, had been sufficient to\r\nmake the time pass not unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nHis evening repast was now a decided improvement on that of the\r\npreceding day.  First of all, he spread some clams in the hot ashes to\r\nroast; and then, taking the dipper which had been used for baling, he\r\nfilled it with water, and placing this on the fire, it soon began to\r\nboil.  Into this he thrust the smallest lobster, and watched it as the\r\nwater bubbled around it, and its scaly covering turned slowly from its\r\noriginal dark hue to a bright red color.\r\n\r\nHis success thus far stimulated him to make some attempts at actual\r\ncookery.  Removing some of the lobster from its shell, he poured out\r\nmost of the water from the pan, and into what remained he again put the\r\nlobster, cutting it up as fine as he could with his knife. Into this he\r\ncrumbled some biscuit, and stirred it up all together. He then placed\r\nit over the fire till it was well baked.  On removing it and tasting\r\nit, he found it most palatable.  It was already sufficiently salt, and\r\nonly needed a little pepper to make it quite equal to any scolloped\r\nlobster that he had ever tasted.\r\n\r\nHis repast consisted of this, followed by the roast clams, which formed\r\nan agreeable variety.\r\n\r\nTom now felt like a giant refreshed; and while sitting in front of the\r\nevening fire, he occupied his mind with plans for the morrow, which\r\nwere all directed towards enlarging his supply of provisions.\r\n\r\nHe awaked late on the next morning, and found the weather unchanged.\r\nHe tried to quell his impatience and disappointment, and feeling that\r\nidleness would never do, he determined to go to work at once, and carry\r\nout the plans of the preceding day.  It was now Thursday, the middle of\r\nthe second week, and the fog had clung pertinaciously around him almost\r\nall that time.  It was indeed disheartening, and idleness under such\r\ncircumstances would have ended in misery and despair; but Tom's\r\nperseverance, and obstinate courage, and buoyant spirits enabled him\r\nstill to rise above circumstances, and struggle with the gloom around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"O, go on, go on,\" he muttered, looking around upon the fog. \"Let's see\r\nwho can stand it longest.  And now for my foraging expedition.\"\r\n\r\nMaking a hearty repast out of the remnants of the supper of the\r\npreceding evening, he went first to the shore, so as to complete his\r\nsearch there while the tide should be low.  It was going down now, and\r\nthe beach was all before him.  He wandered on till he came to where\r\nthere was an immense ledge of sharp rocks, that went from the foot of\r\nthe precipice down into the bay.  Over these he clambered, looking\r\ncarefully around, until at last he reached the very lowest point.  Here\r\nhe soon found some articles of diet, which were quite as valuable in\r\ntheir way as the clams and lobsters. First of all, he found an immense\r\nquantity of large mussels.  These were entangled among the thick masses\r\nof sea-weed.  He knew that the flavor of mussels was much more delicate\r\nthan that of clams or lobsters, and that by many connoisseurs these,\r\nwhen good and fresh, were ranked next to oysters.  This discovery,\r\ntherefore, gave him great joy, and he filled his pan, which he had\r\ncarried down, and took them back to the shore.  He also took an armful\r\nof sea-weed, and, reaching his camping-place, he threw the mussels in a\r\nhollow place in the sand, placing the sea-weed around them.  In this\r\nway he knew that they would keep fresh and sweet for any reasonable\r\nlength of time.\r\n\r\nReturning to the ledges of rock, he walked about among them, and found\r\na number of pools, some of which were of considerable size. These had\r\nbeen left by the retreating water; and in these hollows he soon saw a\r\nnumber of small objects moving about.  Some of them he caught without\r\nmuch difficulty, and saw that they were shrimps. He had hoped to find\r\nsome of these, but the discovery came to him like some unexpected\r\npleasure, and seemed more than he had any right to count on.  Beside\r\nthe shrimps his other discoveries seemed inferior.  There was a large\r\nnumber, and they could be caught without much trouble.  He soon filled\r\nhis pan, and brought these also to his camping-place.  These he\r\ndeposited in a little pool, which was on the surface of some rocks that\r\nlay not far from the shore.  Over these he also laid some sea-weed.\r\n\r\nThe tide was now coming up, but Tom made a further journey to the\r\nbeach, so as to secure something which he had noticed during his\r\nprevious expedition.  This was a marine plant called dulse, which, in\r\nthese waters, grows very plentifully, and is gathered and dried by the\r\npeople in large quantities.  It was a substance of which Tom was very\r\nfond, and he determined to gather some, and dry it in the sun.\r\nCollecting an armful of this, he took it to the shore, and spread it\r\nout over the grass, though, in that damp and foggy atmosphere, there\r\nwas not much prospect of its drying.\r\n\r\nIt was now about three o'clock in the afternoon, and Tom's researches\r\nalong the shore were successfully terminated.  He had found all the\r\ndifferent articles that he had thought of and his new acquisitions were\r\nnow lying about him.\r\n\r\nThese were,--\r\n\r\n  Clams,\r\n  Lobsters,\r\n  Mussels,\r\n  Shrimps,\r\n  Dulse.\r\n\r\nAs he murmured to himself the list of things, he smiled triumphantly.\r\n\r\nBut still there was work to be done.  Tom intended to keep fashionable\r\nhours, and dine late, with only a lunch in the middle of the day.  His\r\nexplorations of the afternoon were to be important, and he hoped that\r\nthey would be crowned with a portion of that success which had attended\r\nthe work of the morning.  He took, therefore, a hasty lunch of biscuit\r\nand cold lobster, washed down with water, and then set forth.\r\n\r\nThis time he turned away from the shore, and went to the top of the\r\nisland.  He carried in his hand a bit of rope, about a dozen feet in\r\nlength, and went along the edge of the cliff as far as he could,\r\nturning aside at times to avoid any clumps of trees or bushes that grew\r\ntoo thickly.  In front of him the line of cliff extended for some\r\ndistance, and he walked along, until, at last, he came to a place where\r\nthe gulls flew about in larger flocks than usual, almost on a line with\r\nthe top of the rock.  He had not noticed them particularly on his\r\nformer walk along here; but now he watched them very attentively, and\r\nfinally stood still, so as to see their actions to better advantage.\r\n\r\nTom, in fact, had made up his mind to procure some gulls' eggs,\r\nthinking that these would make an addition to his repast of great\r\nimportance; and he now watched the motions of these birds, so as to\r\ndetect the most accessible of their nests.  He did not have to watch\r\nlong.  A little observation showed him a place, just under the cliff,\r\nnot far away from him.  Hastening forward, he bent over, and, looking\r\ndown, he saw a large number of nests.  They had been constructed on a\r\nshelf of rock immediately below the edge of the cliff, and the eggs\r\nwere within easy reach.  The gulls flew about wildly, as the intruder\r\nreached down his hands towards their nests, and screamed and shrieked,\r\nwhile some of them rushed towards him, within a few feet of his head,\r\nas though they would assail him and beat him off.  But Tom's\r\ndetermination did not falter.  He cared no more for the gulls than if\r\nthey were so many pigeons, but secured as many eggs as he could carry.\r\nThese he took with him back to his camp.\r\n\r\nBut he was not yet satisfied.  He was anxious to have some vegetables;\r\nand over the open ground, among the grass, he had seen plants which\r\nwere very familiar to him.  There were dandelions; and Tom saw in them\r\nsomething that seemed worth more than any of his other acquisitions.\r\nGoing forth in search of these, he managed to get his pan full of them.\r\nThese he washed, and after cutting off the roots, he put them in the\r\npan with water, and then set them over the fire to boil.\r\n\r\nWhile they were boiling Tom went off once more, and found some wild\r\nstrawberries.  They were quite plentiful about here, and this was the\r\nseason for them.  He stripped a piece of bark from a birch tree, as the\r\ncountry people do, and formed from this a dish which would hold about a\r\nquart.  This he filled after a moderate search.\r\n\r\nHe took the strawberries to his camp, and then, going back to the\r\nwoods, he procured some more birch bark, out of which he made a half\r\ndozen dishes.  It was now about five o'clock, and Tom thought it was\r\ntime for him to begin to cook his dinner.\r\n\r\nThe dandelions were not quite cooked as yet; so Tom had to wait; but\r\nwhile doing so, he heated some stones in the fire.  By the time they\r\nwere heated, the dandelions were cooked; and Tom, removing the pan, put\r\nsome shrimps and mussels in it, to boil over the fire.  He then removed\r\nthe stones, and placed one of the lobsters among them in such a way,\r\nthat it was surrounded on every side in a hot oven. He then buried a\r\nfew clams among the hot ashes, and did the same with three or four of\r\nthe gulls' eggs.\r\n\r\nOne of the hot stones was reserved for another purpose.  It was the\r\nlargest of them, and was red hot when he drew it from the fire, but\r\nsoon cooled down enough to resume its natural color, although it\r\nretained an intense heat.\r\n\r\nOver this he spread some of the wet dulse, which soon crackled and\r\nshrivelled up, sending forth a rich and fragrant steam.  In roasting\r\nthis dulse, a large piece would shrink to very small proportions, so\r\nthat half of Tom's armful, when thus roasted, was reduced to but a\r\nsmall handful.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing this, he drew the gulls' eggs from the fire, and taking\r\noff the shells, he cut them in slices, and put them with the\r\ndandelions.  Then he took the shrimps and mussels from the fire, and\r\nremoving them from the pan, he separated them, and put them into\r\ndifferent bark dishes.  The clams were next drawn forth, and though\r\nrather overdone, they were, nevertheless, of tempting appearance and\r\nappetizing odor.  Finally, the lobster was removed, and Tom contented\r\nhimself with one of the claws, which he placed on a dish, reserving the\r\nremainder for another time.\r\n\r\nAnd now the articles were all cooked, and Tom's repast was ready. He\r\nlooked with a smile of gratification upon the various dishes which his\r\ningenuity and industry had drawn forth from the rocks, and cliffs, and\r\nmud, and sand of a desert island, and wondered whether other islands,\r\nin tropical climates, could yield a more varied or more nutritious\r\nsupply.  He thought of other plants which might be found here, and\r\ndetermined to try some that seemed to be nutritious.\r\n\r\nHere is the repast which Tom, on that occasion, spread before himself:--\r\n\r\n   1.  Roast clams,\r\n   2.  Baked lobster,\r\n   3.  Boiled mussels,\r\n   4.  Boiled shrimps,\r\n   5.  Roast eggs,\r\n   6.  Dandelions,\r\n   7.  Dandelions with eggs,\r\n   8.  Roast dulse,\r\n   9.  Strawberries,\r\n  10.  Pilot-bread.\r\n\r\nIn one thing only did Tom fall short of his wishes, and that was in the\r\nway of drinks.  But before that dinner was finished, even this was\r\nremedied; for necessity, the great mother of invention, instigated Tom\r\nto squeeze about half of his strawberries into a little water.  Out of\r\nthis he formed a drink with a flavor that seemed to him to be quite\r\ndelicious.  And that made what Tom called,--\r\n\r\n  11.  Strawberry cordial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nNew Discoveries.--The Boat.--A great Swell.--Meditations and Plans.--A\r\nnew, and wonderful, and before unheard-of Application of Spruce\r\nGum.--I'm afloat!  I'm afloat!\r\n\r\n\r\nTom sat there over his banquet until late.  He then went down to the\r\nbeach, and brought up a vast collection of driftwood, and throwing a\r\nplenteous supply upon the fire, he lay down beside it, and looked out\r\nover the water, trying, as usual, to see something through the thick\r\nmist.  The flames shot up with a crackle and a great blaze, and the\r\nbright light shone brilliantly upon the water. The tide was now up, and\r\nthe boat was full before him.  Tom fixed his eyes upon this boat, and\r\nwas mournfully recalling his unsuccessful experiment at making her\r\nsea-worthy, and was waiting to see her sink down to her gunwales as she\r\nfilled, when the thought occurred to him that she was not filling so\r\nrapidly as she might, but was floating much better than usual.  A\r\nsteady observation served to show him that this was no fancy, but an\r\nactual fact; and the confirmation of this first impression at once\r\ndrove away all other thoughts, and brought back all the ideas of escape\r\nwhich he once had cherished.\r\n\r\nThe boat was admitting the water, certainly, yet she certainly did not\r\nleak quite so badly as before, but was floating far better than she had\r\ndone on the night of his trial.  What was the meaning of this?\r\n\r\nNow, the fact is, he had not noticed the boat particularly during the\r\nlast few days.  He had given it up so completely, that it ceased to\r\nhave any interest in his eyes.  Raising his signal, building his house,\r\nand exploring the island had taken up all his thoughts.  Latterly he\r\nhad thought of nothing but his dinner.  But now the change in the boat\r\nwas unmistakable, and it seemed to him that the change might have been\r\ngoing on gradually all this time without his noticing it until it had\r\nbecome so marked.\r\n\r\nWhat was the cause of this change?  That was the question which he now\r\nsought to answer.  After some thought he found a satisfactory\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nFor a number of days the boat had been admitting the water till she was\r\nfull.  This water had remained in for an hour or more, and this process\r\nof filling and emptying had been repeated every tide.  The atmosphere\r\nalso had been wet, and the wood, thus saturated with water so\r\nfrequently, had no chance of getting dry.  Tom thought, therefore, that\r\nthe wooden framework, which he had constructed so as to tighten the\r\nleak, had been gradually swelling from the action of the water; and the\r\nplanks of the boat had been tightening their cracks from the same\r\ncause, so that now the opening was not nearly so bad as it had been.\r\nThus the boat, which once had been able to float him for a quarter of\r\nan hour or more, ought now to be able to float him for at least double\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nTom watched the boat very attentively while the tide was up; and, when\r\nat length it began to retreat, and leave it once more aground, he\r\nnoticed that it was not more than half full of water.  If any\r\nconfirmation had been needed to the conclusions which he had drawn from\r\nseeing the improved buoyancy of the boat, it would have been afforded\r\nby this.  Tom accepted this with delight, as an additional circumstance\r\nin his favor; and now, having become convinced of this much, he set his\r\nwits to work to see if some plan could not be hit upon by means of\r\nwhich the boat could once more be made sea-worthy.\r\n\r\nTom's indefatigable perseverance must have been noticed by this time.\r\nTo make the best of circumstances; to stand face to face with\r\nmisfortune, and shrink not; to meet the worst with equanimity, and\r\ngrasp eagerly at the slightest favorable change,--such was the\r\ncharacter that Tom had shown during his experience of the past. Now,\r\nonce more, he grasped at this slight circumstance that appeared to\r\nfavor his hopes, and sought to find some way by which that\r\nhalf-floating boat could be made to float wholly, and bear him away to\r\nthose shores that were so near by.  Too long had he been submitting to\r\nthis imprisonment; too long had he been waiting for schooners to pass\r\nand to bring him help; too long had he been shut in by a fog that\r\nseemed destined never to lift so long as he was here.  If he could only\r\nform some kind of a boat that would float long enough to land him on\r\nthe nearest coast, all that he wished would be gratified.\r\n\r\nAs he thought over this subject, he saw plainly what he had felt very\r\nstrongly before--that the boat could not be sea-worthy unless he had\r\nsome tar with which to plaster over the broken bow, and fill in the\r\ngaping seams; but there was no tar.  Still, did it follow that there\r\nwas nothing else?  Might not something be found upon the island which\r\nwould serve the purpose of tar?  There must be some such substance and\r\nperhaps it might be found here.\r\n\r\nTom now thought over all the substances that he could bring before his\r\nmind.  Would clay do?  No; clay would not.  Would putty?  No, and\r\nbesides, he could not get any.  What, then, would serve this important\r\npurpose?\r\n\r\nTar was produced from trees.  Were there no trees here that produced\r\nsome sticky and glutinous substance like tar?  There was the resin of\r\npine trees, but there were no pines on the island. What then?  These\r\nfir trees had a sort of sticky, balsamic juice that exuded plentifully\r\nfrom them wherever they were cut.  Might he not make some use of that?\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of reflections like these, he thought of the gum\r\nthat is found on spruce trees--spruce gum!  It was an idea that\r\ndeserved to be followed up and carried out.  Thus far he had never\r\nthought of spruce gum, except as something which he, like most boys,\r\nwas fond of chewing; but now it appeared before his mind as affording a\r\npossible solution of his difficulty.  The more he thought of it, the\r\nmore did it seem that this would be adapted to his purpose.  The only\r\nquestion was, whether he could obtain enough of it.  He thought that he\r\nmight easily obtain enough if he only took the proper time and care.\r\n\r\nWith this new plan in his mind, Tom retired for the night, and awaked\r\nthe next morning by the dawn of day.  It was still foggy; but he was\r\nnow so resigned, and was so full of his new plan, that it did not\r\ntrouble him in the slightest degree.  In fact, he was so anxious to try\r\nthis, that the sight of a boat landing on the beach, all ready to take\r\nhim off, would not have afforded him an unmixed satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe took his tin dipper, and went up at once into the woods.  Here he\r\nlooked around very carefully, and soon found what he wanted.  He knew\r\nperfectly well, of course, how to distinguish spruce trees from fir, by\r\nthe sharp, prickly spires of the former, and so he was never at a loss\r\nwhich trees to search.  No sooner had he begun, than he was surprised\r\nat the quantities that he found.  To an ordinary observer the trunk of\r\nthe spruce tree seems like any other tree trunk--no rougher, and\r\nperhaps somewhat smoother than many; but Tom now found that on every\r\ntree almost there were little round excrescences, which, on being\r\npicked at with the knife, came off readily, and proved to be gum.  Vast\r\nquantities of a substance which goes by the name of spruce gum are\r\nmanufactured and sold; but the pure gum is a very different article,\r\nhaving a rich, balsamic odor, and a delicate yet delicious flavor; and\r\nTom, as he filled his pan, and inhaled the fragrance that was emitted\r\nby its contents, lamented that his necessities compelled him to use it\r\nfor such a purpose as that to which this was destined.  After four or\r\nfive hours' work, he found that he had gathered enough.  He had filled\r\nhis pan no less than six times, and had secured a supply which was\r\namply sufficient to give a coating of thick gum over all the fractured\r\nplace.  The tide, which had already risen, was now falling, and, as\r\nsoon as the boat was aground, and the water out of her, Tom proceeded\r\nto raise her bows, in precisely the same manner as he had raised the\r\nboat on a former occasion.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to bring the gum into a fit condition for use. This\r\nhe did by kindling the fire, and melting it in his tin pan. This would\r\nrather interfere with the use of that article as a cooking utensil, but\r\nnow that Tom's mind was full of this new purpose, cooking and things of\r\nthat sort had lost all attractions for him.  As for food, there was no\r\nfear about that.  He had his biscuit, and the lobster and shell-fish\r\nwhich he had cooked on the preceding day were but partially consumed.\r\nEnough remained to supply many more meals.\r\n\r\nThe gum soon melted, and then a brush was needed to apply it to the\r\nboat.  This was procured by cutting off a little strip of canvas, about\r\na yard long and six inches wide.  By picking out some of the threads,\r\nand rolling it up, a very serviceable brush was formed.\r\n\r\nTaking the gum now in its melted state, Tom dipped his brush into it,\r\nand applied it all over the broken surface of the bow, pressing the hot\r\nliquid in close, and allowing it to harden in the cracks. His first\r\ncoating of gum was very satisfactorily applied, and it seemed as though\r\na few more coatings ought to secure the boat from the entrance of the\r\nwater.  The gum was tenacious, and its only bad quality was its\r\nbrittleness; but, as it would not be exposed to the blows of any hard\r\nsubstances, it seemed quite able to serve Tom's wants.\r\n\r\nTom now went down to the drift-wood and brought up a fresh supply of\r\nfuel, after which he melted a second panful of gum, and applied this to\r\nthe boat.  He endeavored to secure an entrance for it into all the\r\ncracks that did not seem to be sufficiently filled at the first\r\napplication, and now had the satisfaction of seeing all of those deep\r\nmarks filled up and effaced by the gum.\r\n\r\nOne place still remained which had not yet been made secure against the\r\nentrance of the water, and that was where the planks gaped open from\r\nthe blow that had crushed in the bows.  Here the canvas that was inside\r\nprotruded slightly.  Torn ripped up some of the canvas that was on the\r\ntent, and taking the threads, stuffed them in the opening, mixing them\r\nwith gum as he did so, until it was filled; and then over this he put a\r\ncoating of the gum.  After this another pan, and yet another, were\r\nmelted, and the hot gum each time was applied.  This gave the whole\r\nsurface a smooth appearance, that promised to be impenetrable to the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe gum which he had collected was enough to fill two more pans. This\r\nhe melted as before, and applied to the bows.  Each new application\r\nclung to the one that had preceded it, in a thick and quickly hardening\r\nlayer, until at last, when the work was done, there appeared a coating\r\nof this gum formed from six successive layers, that was smooth, and\r\nhard, and without any crack whatever. It seemed absolutely water-tight;\r\nand Tom, as he looked at it now, could not imagine where the water\r\ncould penetrate.  Yet, in order to make assurance doubly sure, he\r\ncollected two more panfuls, and melting this he applied it as before.\r\nAfter this was over, he made a torch of birch bark, and lighting this,\r\nhe held the flame against the gum till the whole outer surface began to\r\nmelt and run together.  This served to secure any crevices that his\r\nbrush might have passed by without properly filling.\r\n\r\nThe work was now complete as far as Tom could do it; and on examining\r\nit, he regretted that he had not thought of this before. He felt an\r\nexultation that he had never known in his life.  If he, by his own\r\nefforts, could thus rescue himself, what a cause it would be always\r\nafter to struggle against misfortune, and rise superior to\r\ncircumstances!\r\n\r\nAs to the voyage, Tom's plan was the same that it had been on a former\r\noccasion.  He would float the boat at high tide, and then push off,\r\nkeeping her near the shore, yet afloat until ebb tide. Then, when the\r\ntide should turn, and the current run up the bay, he would put off, and\r\nfloat along with the stream until he reached land.\r\n\r\nAccording to his calculations it would be high tide about two hours\r\nafter dark, which would be some time after ten.  He would have to be up\r\nall night; for the tide would not turn until after four in the morning.\r\nBut that did not trouble him.  He would have too much on his mind to\r\nallow him to feel sleepy, and, besides, the hope which lay before him\r\nwould prevent him from feeling fatigue.\r\n\r\nOne thing more remained, and that was, to bring up a fresh supply of\r\nfuel.  The night would be dark, and while floating in the boat, he\r\nwould need the light of the fire.  So he brought up from the beach an\r\nample supply of drift-wood, and laid it with the rest.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom's work was ended, it was late in the day, and he determined to\r\nsecure some sleep before he began his long night's work.  He knew that\r\nhe could waken at the right time; so he laid himself down in his tent,\r\nand soon slept the sleep of the weary.\r\n\r\nBy ten o'clock he was awake.  He found the water already up to the\r\nboat.  There was no time to lose.  He carried his box of biscuit on\r\nboard, and filled his pan with water from the brook, so as to secure\r\nhimself against thirst in case the boat should float away farther than\r\nhe anticipated.  Then he took his paddle, and got into the boat.\r\n\r\nThe water came up higher.  Most anxiously Tom watched it as it rose.\r\nThe fire was burning low, and in order to make more light, Tom went\r\nashore and heaped an immense quantity of wood upon it. The flames now\r\nblazed up bright, and on going back again to the boat, the water was\r\nplainly visible as it closed around the bows.\r\n\r\nMost anxiously he now awaited, with his eyes fastened upon the bottom\r\nof the boat.  He had not brought the old sail this time, but left it\r\nover his tent, and he could see plainly.  Higher came the water, and\r\nstill higher, yet none came into the boat, and Tom could scarce believe\r\nin his good fortune.\r\n\r\nAt last the boat floated!\r\n\r\nYes, the crisis had come and passed, and the boat floated!\r\n\r\nThere was now no longer any doubt.  His work was successful; his\r\ndeliverance was sure.  The way over the waters was open.  Farewell to\r\nhis island prison!  Welcome once more the great world!  Welcome home,\r\nand friends, and happiness!\r\n\r\nIn that moment of joy his heart seemed almost ready to burst.  It was\r\nwith difficulty that he calmed himself; and then, offering up a prayer\r\nof thanksgiving, he pushed off from the shore.\r\n\r\nThe boat floated!\r\n\r\nThe tide rose, and lingered, and fell.\r\n\r\nThe boat floated still.\r\n\r\nThere was not the slightest sign of a leak.  Every hour, as it passed,\r\nserved to give Tom a greater assurance that the boat was sea-worthy.\r\n\r\nHe found no difficulty in keeping her afloat, even while retaining her\r\nnear the shore, so that she might be out of the way of the currents.\r\n\r\nAt length, when the tide was about half way down, he found the fire\r\nburning too low, and determined to go ashore and replenish it.  A rock\r\njutted above the water not far off.  To this he secured the boat, and\r\nthen landing, he walked up the beach.  Reaching the fire, he threw upon\r\nit all the remaining wood.  Returning then to the boat, he boarded her\r\nwithout difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe tide fell lower and lower.\r\n\r\nAnd now Tom found it more and more difficult to keep the boat afloat,\r\nwithout allowing her to be caught by the current.  He did not dare to\r\nkeep her bows near the shore, but turned her about, so that her stem\r\nshould rest from time to time on the gravel.  At last the tide was so\r\nlow that rocks appeared above the surface, and the boat occasionally\r\nstruck them in a very unpleasant manner.  To stay so near the shore any\r\nlonger was not possible.  A slight blow against a rock might rub off\r\nall the brittle gum, and then his chances would be destroyed.  He\r\ndetermined to put out farther, and trust himself to Providence.\r\n\r\nSlowly and cautiously he let his boat move out into deeper water.\r\n\r\nBut slowness and caution were of little avail.  In the deeper water\r\nthere was a strong current, which at once caught the boat and bore her\r\nalong.  Tom struggled bravely against it, but without avail. He thought\r\nfor a moment of seeking the shore again, but the fear that the boat\r\nwould be ruined deterred him.\r\n\r\nThere was a little wind blowing from the southwest, and he determined\r\nto trust to the sail.  He loosened this, and, sitting down, waited for\r\nfurther developments.\r\n\r\nThe wind filled the sail, and the boat's progress was checked somewhat,\r\nyet still she drifted down the bay.\r\n\r\nShe was drifting down past the north shore of the island.  Tom could\r\nsee, amid the gloom, the frowning cliffs as he drifted past. The\r\nfirelight was lost to view; then he looked for some time upon the dark\r\nform of the island.\r\n\r\nAt last even that was lost to view.\r\n\r\nHe was drifting down the bay, and was already below Ile Haute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nScott's Bay and Old Bennie.--His two Theories.--Off to the desert\r\nIsland.--Landing.--A Picnic Ground.--Gloom and Despair of the\r\nExplorers.--All over.--Sudden Summons.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on Wednesday evening that the Antelope passed from the sunshine\r\nand beauty of Digby Basin out into the fog and darkness of the Bay of\r\nFundy.  The tide was falling, and, though the wind was in their favor,\r\nyet their progress was somewhat slow.  But the fact that they were\r\nmoving was of itself a consolation.  In spite of Captain Corbet's\r\ndeclared preference for tides and anchors, and professed contempt for\r\nwind and sails, the boys looked upon these last as of chief importance,\r\nand preferred a slow progress with the wind to even a more rapid one by\r\nmeans of so unsatisfactory a method of travel as drifting.\r\n\r\nAt about nine on the following morning, the Antelope reached a little\r\nplace called Wilmot Landing, where they went on shore and made the\r\nusual inquiries with the usual result.  Embarking again, they sailed on\r\nfor the remainder of that day, and stopped at one or two places along\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning (Friday) they dropped anchor in front of Hall's\r\nHarbor--a little place whose name had become familiar to them during\r\ntheir memorable excursion to Blomidon.  Here they met with the same\r\ndiscouraging answer to their question.\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" said Captain Corbet, \"we don't seem to meet with much success to\r\nspeak of--do we?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Bart, gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose your pa'll be sendin schooners over this here same ground.\r\n'Tain't no use, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall we go next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, we've ben over the hull bay mostly; but thar's one place, yet, an\r\nthat we'll go to next.\"\r\n\r\n\"What place is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scott's Bay.\r\n\r\n\"My idee is this,\" continued Captain Corbet:  \"We'll finish our tower\r\nof inspection round the Bay of Fundy at Scott's Bay.  Thar won't be\r\nnothin more to do; thar won't remain one single settlement but what\r\nwe've called at, 'cept one or two triflin places of no 'count.  So,\r\nafter Scott's Bay, my idee is to go right straight off to old Minas.\r\nWho knows but what he's got on thar somewhar?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see much chance of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, if he had drifted into the Straits of Minas, he'd manage to\r\nget ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's so narrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Narrer?  O, it's wider'n you think for; besides, ef he got stuck into\r\nthe middle of that thar curn't, how's he to get to the shore? an him\r\nwithout any oars?  Answer me that.  No, sir; the boat that'll drift\r\ndown Petticoat Jack into the bay, without gettin ashore, 'll drift up\r\nthem straits into Minas jest the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there does seem something in that.  I didn't think of his\r\ndrifting down the Petitcodiac.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somethin?  Bless your heart! ain't that everythin?\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you think there's really a chance yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"A chance?  Course thar is.  While thar's life thar's hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how could he live so long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He might starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not he.  Didn't he carry off my box o' biscuit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Think of this fog.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, fog ain't much.  It's snow an cold that tries a man.  He's tough,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he's been so exposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exposed?  What to?  Not he.  Didn't he go an carry off that ole sail?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot help thinking that it's all over with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't give him up; keep up; cheer up.  Think how we got hold of ole\r\nSolomon after givin him up.  I tell you that thar was a good sign.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's been gone too long.  Why, it's going on a fortnight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, what o' that ef he's goin to turn up all right in the end?  I\r\ntell you he's somewhar.  Ef he ain't in the Bay of Fundy, he may be\r\ndriftin off the coast o' Maine, an picked up long ago, an on his way\r\nhome now per steamer.\"\r\n\r\nBart shook his head, and turned away in deep despondency, in which\r\nfeeling all the other boys joined him.  They had but little hope now.\r\nThe time that had elapsed seemed to be too long, and their\r\ndisappointments had been too many.  The sadness which they had felt all\r\nalong was now deeper than ever, and they looked forward without a ray\r\nof hope.\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening they landed at Scott's Bay, and, as old Bennie\r\nGriggs's house was nearest, they went there.  They found both the old\r\npeople at home, and were received with an outburst of welcome. Captain\r\nCorbet was an old acquaintance, and made himself at home at once.  Soon\r\nhis errand was announced.\r\n\r\nBennie had the usual answer, and that was, that nothing whatever had\r\nbeen heard of any drifting boat.  But he listened with intense interest\r\nto Captain Corbet's story, and made him tell it over and over again,\r\ndown to the smallest particular.  He also questioned all the boys very\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\nAfter the questioning was over, he sat in silence for a long time. At\r\nlast he looked keenly at Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"He's not ben heard tell of for about twelve days?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"An it's ben ony moderate weather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ony moderate, but foggy.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, of course.  Wal, in my 'pinion, fust an foremust, he ain't likely\r\nto hev gone down.\"\r\n\r\n\"That thar's jest what I say.\"\r\n\r\n\"An he had them biscuit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--a hull box.\"\r\n\r\n\"An the sail for shelter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal; it's queer.  He can't hev got down by the State o' Maine; for, ef\r\nhe'd got thar, he'd hev sent word home before this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Course he would.\"\r\n\r\nOld Bennie thought over this for a long time again, and the boys\r\nwatched him closely, as though some result of vital importance hung\r\nupon his final decision.\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" said Bennie at last, \"s'posin that he's alive,--an it's very\r\nlikely,--thar's ony two ways to account for his onnat'ral silence. Them\r\nair these:--\r\n\r\n\"Fust, he may hev got picked up by a timber ship, outward bound to the\r\nold country.  In that case he may be carried the hull way acrost.  I've\r\nknowed one or two sech cases, an hev heerd of severial more.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  He may hev drifted onto a oninhabited island.\"\r\n\r\n\"An oninhabited island?\" repeated Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"Yea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal,\" said Captain Corbet; after a pause, \"I've knowed things stranger\r\nthan that.\"\r\n\r\n\"So hev I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Air thar any isle of the ocean in particular that you happen to hev in\r\nyour mind's eye now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thar air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ile Haute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, now, railly, I declar--ef I wan't thinkin o' that very spot\r\nmyself.  An I war thinkin, as I war a comin up the bay, that that thar\r\nisle of the ocean was about the only spot belongin to this here bay\r\nthat hadn't been heerd from.  An it ain't onlikely that them shores\r\ncould a tale onfold that mought astonish some on us. I shouldn't wonder\r\na mite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor me,\" said Bennie, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"It's either a timber ship, or a desert island, as you say,--that's\r\nsartin,\" said Captain Corbet, after further thought, speaking with\r\nstrong emphasis.  \"Thar ain't a mite o' doubt about it; an which o'\r\nthem it is air a very even question.  For my part, I'd as soon bet on\r\none as t'other.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heerd tell o' several seafarin men that's got adrift, an lit on\r\nthat thar isle,\" said Bennie, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, so hev I; an though our lad went all the way from Petticoat Jack,\r\nyet the currents in thar wandorins to an fro could effectooate that\r\nthar pooty mighty quick, an in the course of two or three days it could\r\nland him high an dry on them thar sequestrated shores.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think there is any chance of it?\" asked Bruce, eagerly,\r\ndirecting his question to Bennie.\r\n\r\n\"Do I think?  Why, sartin,\" said Bennie, regarding Bruce's anxious face\r\nwith a calm smile.  \"Hain't I ben a expoundin to you the actool facts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" cried Bart, starting to his feet, \"let's go at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's what?\" asked Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\"Why, hurry off at once, and get to him as soon as we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"An pray, young sir, how could we get to him by leavin here jest now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we go straight to Ile Haute?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scacely.  The tide'll be agin us, an the wind too, till nigh eleven.\"\r\n\r\nBart gave a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\"But don't be alarmed.  We'll go thar next, an as soon as we can. You\r\nsee we've got to go on into Minas Basin.  Now we want to leave here so\r\nas to drop down with the tide, an then drop up with the flood tide into\r\nMinas Bay.  I've about concluded to wait here till about three in the\r\nmornin.  We'll drop down to the island in about a couple of hours,\r\nand'll hev time to run ashore, look round, and catch the flood tide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know best,\" said Bart, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"I think that's the only true an rational idee,\" said Bennie.  \"I do,\r\nrailly; an meantime you can all get beds here with me, an you can hev a\r\ngood bit o' sleep before startin.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place not long after their arrival.  The company\r\nwere sitting in the big old kitchen, and Mrs. Bennie was spreading her\r\nmost generous repast on the table.\r\n\r\nAfter a bounteous supper the two old men talked over the situation\r\nuntil bedtime.  They told many stories about drifting boats and rafts,\r\ncompared notes about the direction of certain currents, and argued\r\nabout the best course to pursue under certain very difficult\r\ncircumstances, such, for example, as a thick snow-storm, midnight, a\r\nheavy sea, and a strong current setting upon a lee shore, the ship's\r\nanchor being broken also.  It was generally considered that the\r\nsituation was likely to be unpleasant.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock Bennie hurried his guests to their beds, where they\r\nslept soundly in spite of their anxiety.  Before three in the morning\r\nhe awaked them, and they were soon ready to reembark.\r\n\r\nIt was dim morning twilight as they bade adieu to their hospitable\r\nentertainers, and but little could be seen.  Captain Corbet raised his\r\nhead, and peered into the sky above, and sniffed the sea air.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, railly,\" said he, \"I do declar ef it don't railly seem as ef it\r\nrailly is a change o' weather--it railly doos.  Why, ain't this rich?\r\nWe're ben favored at last.  We're agoin to hev a clar day. Hooray!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys could not make out whether the captain's words were justified\r\nor not by the facts, but thought that they detected in the air rather\r\nthe fragrance of the land than the savor of the salt sea.  There was no\r\nwind, however, and they could not see far enough out on the water to\r\nknow whether there was any fog or not.\r\n\r\nBennie accompanied them to the boat, and urged them to come back if\r\nthey found the boys and let him rest in Scott's Bay.  But the fate of\r\nthat boy was so uncertain, that they could not make any promise about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was a little after three when the Antelope weighed anchor, and\r\ndropped down the bay.\r\n\r\nThere was no wind whatever.  It was the tide only that carried them\r\ndown to their destination.  Soon it began to grow lighter, and by the\r\ntime that they were half way, they saw before them the dark outline of\r\nthe island, as it rose from the black water with its frowning cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe boys looked at it in silence.  It seemed, indeed, a hopeless place\r\nto search in for signs of poor Tom.  How could he ever get ashore in\r\nsuch a place as this, so far out of the line of his drift; or if he had\r\ngone ashore there, how could he have lived till now?  Such were the\r\ngloomy and despondent thoughts that filled the minds of all, as they\r\nsaw the vessel drawing nearer and still nearer to those frowning cliffs.\r\n\r\nAs they went on the wind grew stronger, and they found that it was\r\ntheir old friend--the sou-wester.  The light increased, and they saw a\r\nfog cloud on the horizon, a little beyond Ile Haute.  Captain Corbet\r\nwould not acknowledge that he had been mistaken in his impressions\r\nabout a change of weather, but assured the boys that this was only the\r\nlast gasp of the sou-wester, and that a change was bound to take place\r\nbefore evening.  But though the fog was visible below Ile Haute, it did\r\nnot seem to come any nearer, and at length the schooner approached the\r\nisland, and dropped anchor.\r\n\r\nIt was about half past four in the morning, and the light of day was\r\nbeginning to be diffused around, when they reached their destination.\r\nAs it was low tide, they could not approach very near, but kept well\r\noff the precipitous shores on the south side of the island.  In the\r\ncourse of her drift, while letting go the anchor, she went off to a\r\npoint about half way down, opposite the shore.  Scarce had her anchor\r\ntouched bottom, than the impatient boys were all in the boat, calling\r\non Captain Corbet to come along. The captain and Wade took the oars.\r\n\r\nIt was a long pull to the shore, and, when they reached it, the tide\r\nwas so low that there remained a long walk over the beach. They had\r\nlanded about half way down the island, and, as they directed their\r\nsteps to the open ground at the east end, they had a much greater\r\ndistance to traverse than they had anticipated.  As they walked on,\r\nthey did not speak a word.  But already they began to doubt whether\r\nthere was any hope left.  They had been bitterly disappointed as they\r\ncame near and saw no sign of life.  They had half expected to see some\r\nfigure on the beach waiting to receive them.  But there was no figure\r\nand no shout of joy.\r\n\r\nAt length, as they drew nearer to the east end, and the light grew\r\nbrighter, Bart, who was in advance, gave a shout.\r\n\r\nThey all hurried forward.\r\n\r\nBart was pointing towards something.\r\n\r\nIt was a signal-staff, with something that looked like a flag hoisted\r\nhalf mast high.\r\n\r\nEvery heart beat faster, and at once the wildest hopes arose.  They\r\nhurried on over the rough beach as fast as possible.  They clambered\r\nover rocks, and sea-weed, and drift-wood, and at length reached the\r\nbank.  And still, as they drew nearer, the signal-staff rose before\r\nthem, and the flag at half mast became more and more visible.\r\n\r\nRushing up the bank towards this place, each trying to outstrip the\r\nothers, they hurried forward, full of hope now that some signs of Tom\r\nmight be here.  At length they reached the place where Tom had been so\r\nlong, and here their steps were arrested by the scene before them.\r\n\r\nOn the point arose the signal-staff, with its heavy flag hanging down.\r\nThe wind was now blowing, but it needed almost a gale to hold out that\r\ncumbrous canvas.  Close by were the smouldering remains of what had\r\nbeen a huge fire, and all around this were chips and sticks.  In the\r\nimmediate neighborhood were some bark dishes, in some of which were\r\nshrimps and mussels.  Clams and lobsters lay around, with shells of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nNot far off was a canvas tent, which looked singularly comfortable and\r\ncosy.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet looked at all this, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Bad--bad--bad,\" he murmured, in a doleful tone.  \"My last hope, or,\r\nrayther, one of my last hopes, dies away inside of me.  This is wuss\r\nthan findin' a desert place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?  Hasn't he been here?  He must have been here,\" cried Bart.\r\n\"These are his marks.  I dare say he's here now--perhaps asleep--in the\r\ncamp.  I'll go--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go--don't--you needn't,\" said Captain Corbet, with a groan. \"You\r\ndon't understand.  It's ben no pore castaway that's come here--no pore\r\ndriftin lad that fell upon these lone and desolate coasts. No--never\r\ndid he set foot here.  All this is not the work o' shipwracked people.\r\nIt's some festive picnickers, engaged in whilin away a few pleasant\r\nsummer days.  All around you may perceive the signs of luxoorious\r\nfeastin.  Here you may see all the different kind o' shellfish that the\r\nsea produces.  Yonder is a luxoorious camp.  But don't mind what I say.\r\nGo an call the occoopant, an satisfy yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet walked with the boys over to the tent.  His words had\r\nthrown a fresh dejection over all.  They felt the truth of what he\r\nsaid.  These remains spoke not of shipwreck, but of pleasure, and of\r\npicnicking.  It now only remained to rouse the slumbering owner of the\r\ntent, and put the usual questions.\r\n\r\nBart was there first, and tapped at the post.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nHe tapped again.\r\n\r\nStill there was no answer.\r\n\r\nHe raised the canvas and looked in.  He saw the mossy interior, but\r\nperceived that it was empty.  All the others looked in.  On learning\r\nthis they turned away puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Wal, I thought so,\" said Captain Corbet.  \"They jest come an go as the\r\nfancy takes 'em.  They're off on Cape d'Or to-day, an back here\r\nto-morrer.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this he seated himself near the tent, and the boys looked\r\naround with sad and sombre faces.\r\n\r\nIt was now about half past five, and the day had dawned for some time.\r\nIn the east the fog had lifted, and the sun was shining brightly.\r\n\r\n\"I told you thar'd be a change, boys,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there came a long succession of sharp, shrill blasts from\r\nthe fog horn of the Antelope, which started every one, and made them\r\nrun to the rising ground to find out the cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\nAstounding Discovery.--The whole Party of Explorers\r\noverwhelmed.--Meeting with the Lost.--Captain Corbet improves the\r\nOccasion.--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the sound from the Antelope they had all started for the rising\r\nground, to see what it might mean.  None of them had any idea what\r\nmight be the cause, but all of them felt startled and excited at\r\nhearing it under such peculiar circumstances.  Nor was their excitement\r\nlessened by the sight that met their eyes as they reached the rising\r\nground and looked towards the schooner.\r\n\r\nA change had taken place.  When they had left, Solomon only had\r\nremained behind.  But now there were two figures on the deck.  One was\r\namidships.  The schooner was too far away for them to see distinctly,\r\nbut this one was undoubtedly Solomon; yet his gestures were so\r\nextraordinary that it was difficult to identify him.  He it was by whom\r\nthe blasts on the fog horn were produced.  Standing amidships, he held\r\nthe fog horn in one hand, and in the other he held a battered old cap\r\nwhich supplied the place of the old straw hat lost at Quaco.  After\r\nletting off a series of blasts from the horn, he brandished his cap\r\nwildly in the air, and then proceeded to dance a sort of complex\r\ndouble-shuffle, diversified by wild leaps in the air, and accompanied\r\nby brandishings of his hat and fresh blasts of the horn.  But if\r\nSolomon's appearance was somewhat bewildering, still more so was that\r\nof the other one.  This one stood astern.  Suddenly as they looked they\r\nsaw him hoist a flag, and, wonder of wonders, a black flag,--no other,\r\nin short, than the well-known flag of the \"B. O. W. C.\"  That flag had\r\nbeen mournfully lowered and put away on Tom's disappearance, but now it\r\nwas hoisted once more; and as they looked, the new comer hoisted it and\r\nlowered it, causing it to rise and fall rapidly before their eyes.\r\n\r\nNor did the wonder end here.  They had taken away the only boat that\r\nthe schooner possessed in order to come ashore, leaving Solomon alone.\r\nThey had noticed no boat whatever as they rowed to land.  But now they\r\nsaw a boat floating astern of the Antelope, with a small and peculiarly\r\nshaped sail, that now was flapping in the breeze.  Evidently this boat\r\nbelonged to the new comer.  But who was he?  How had he come there?\r\nWhat was the meaning of those signals with that peculiar flag, and what\r\ncould be the reason of Solomon's joy?\r\n\r\nThey stood dumb with astonishment, confused, and almost afraid to think\r\nof the one cause that each one felt to be the real explanation of all\r\nthis.  Too long had they searched in vain for Tom,--too often had they\r\nsunk from hope to despair,--too confident and sanguine had they been;\r\nand now, at this unexpected sight, in spite of the assurance which it\r\nmust have given them that this could be no other than Tom, they scarce\r\ndared to believe in such great happiness, and were afraid that even\r\nthis might end in a disappointment like the others.\r\n\r\nBut, though they stood motionless and mute, the two figures on board\r\nthe Antelope were neither one nor the other.  Solomon danced more and\r\nmore madly, and brandished his arms more and more excitedly, and there\r\ncame forth from his fog horn wilder and still wilder peals, and the\r\nflag rose and fell more and more quickly, until at last the spectators\r\non the shore could resist no longer.\r\n\r\n\"G-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-d ger-ra-a-a-cious!\"\r\n\r\nThis cry burst from Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\nIt was enough.  The spell was broken.  A wild cry burst forth from the\r\nboys, and with loud, long shouts of joy they rushed down the bank, and\r\nover the beach, back to their boat.  The captain was as quick as any of\r\nthem.  In his enthusiasm he forgot his rheumatism. There was a race,\r\nand though he was not even with Bruce and Bart, he kept ahead of Pat,\r\nand Arthur, and Phil, and old Wade.\r\n\r\nHurrah!\r\n\r\nAnd hurrah again!\r\n\r\nYes, and hurrah over and over; and many were the hurrahs that burst\r\nfrom them as they raced over the rocky beach.\r\n\r\nThen to tumble into the boat, one after another, to grasp the oars, to\r\npush her off, to head her for the schooner, and to dash through the\r\nwater on their way back, was but the work of a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe row to the schooner was a tedious one to those impatient young\r\nhearts.  But as they drew nearer, they feasted their eyes on the figure\r\nof the new comer, and the last particle of doubt and fear died away.\r\nFirst, they recognized the dress--the familiar red shirt.  Tom had worn\r\na coat and waistcoat ashore at Hillsborough on that eventful day; but\r\non reaching the schooner, he had flung them off, and appeared now in\r\nthe costume of the \"B. O. W. C.\"  This they recognized first, and then\r\nhis face was revealed--a face that bore no particular indication of\r\nsuffering or privation, which seemed certainly more sunburnt than\r\nformerly, but no thinner.\r\n\r\nSoon they reached the vessel, and clambered up; and then with what\r\nshouts and almost shrieks of joy they seized Tom!  With what cries and\r\ncheers of delight they welcomed him back again, by turns overwhelming\r\nhim with questions, and then pouring forth a torrent of description of\r\ntheir own long search!\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stood a little aloof.  His face was not so radiant as\r\nthe faces of the boys.  His features were twitching, and his hands were\r\nclasped tight behind his back.  He stood leaning against the mainmast,\r\nhis eyes fixed on Tom.  It was thus that he stood when Tom caught sight\r\nof him, and rushed up to shake hands.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet grasped Tom's hand in both of his.  He trembled, and Tom\r\nfelt that his hands were cold and clammy.\r\n\r\n\"My dear boys,\" he faltered, \"let us rejice--and--be glad--for this my\r\nson--that was dead--is alive agin--\"\r\n\r\nA shudder passed through him, and he stopped, and pressed Tom's hand\r\nconvulsively.\r\n\r\nThen he gave a great gasp, and, \"Thar, thar,\" he murmured, \"it's too\r\nmuch!  I'm onmanned.  I've suffered--an agonized--an this--air--too\r\nmuch!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThen he dropped Tom's hand, and retreated into the cabin, where he\r\nremained for a long time, but at last reappeared, restored to calmness,\r\nand with a smile of sweet and inexpressible peace wreathing his\r\nvenerable countenance.\r\n\r\nBy this time the boys had told Tom all about their long search; and\r\nwhen Captain Corbet reappeared, Tom had completed the story of his\r\nadventures, and had just reached that part, in his wanderings, where he\r\nhad left the island, and found himself drifting down the bay.  As that\r\nwas the point at which Tom was last lost sight of in these pages, his\r\nstory may be given here in his own words.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"you see I found myself drifting down.  There was no\r\nhelp for it.  The wind was slight, and the tide was strong.  I was\r\nswept down into a fog bank, and lost sight of Ile Haute altogether.\r\nWell, it didn't matter very much, and I wasn't a bit anxious.  I knew\r\nthat the tide would turn soon, and then I'd come up, and fetch the land\r\nsomewhere; so I waited patiently.  At last, after about--well, nearly\r\nan hour, the tide must have turned, and I drifted back, and there was\r\nwind enough to give me quite a lift; and so all of a sudden I shot out\r\nof the fog, and saw Ile Haute before me.  I was coming in such a way\r\nthat my course lay on the south side of the island, and in a short time\r\nI came in sight of the schooner.  I tell you what it is, I nearly went\r\ninto fits--I knew her at once.  A little farther on, and I saw you all\r\ncutting like mad over the beach to my camp.  I was going to put after\r\nyou at first; but the fact is, I hated the island so that I couldn't\r\nbear to touch it again, and so I concluded I'd go on board and signal.\r\nSo I came up alongside, and got on board.  Solomon was down below; so I\r\njust stepped forward, and put my head over the hatchway, and spoke to\r\nhim.  I declare I thought he'd explode.  He didn't think I was a ghost\r\nat all.  It wasn't fear, you know--it was nothing but delight, and all\r\nthat sort of thing, you know. Well, you know, then we went to work\r\nsignaling to you, and he took the fog horn, and I went to the flag, and\r\nso it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how we happened not to see your boat,\" said Bruce.\r\n\r\n\"O, that's easy enough to account for,\" said Tom.  \"I was hid by the\r\neast point of the island.  I didn't see the schooner till I got round,\r\nand you must have been just getting ashore at that time.\"\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Solomon had been wandering about in a mysterious\r\nmanner; now diving below into the hold, and rattling the pots and pans;\r\nagain emerging upon deck, and standing to listen to Tom and look at\r\nhim.  His face shone like a polished boot; there was a grin on his face\r\nthat showed every tooth in his head, and his little twinkling black\r\nbeads of eyes shone, and sparkled, and rolled about till the winking\r\nblack pupils were eclipsed by the whites.  At times he would stand\r\nstill, and whisper solemnly and mysteriously to himself, and then,\r\nwithout a moment's warning, he would bring his hands down on his\r\nthighs, and burst into a loud, long, obstreperous, and deafening peal\r\nof uncontrollable laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Solomon,\" said Tom, at last, \"Solomon, my son, won't you burst if you\r\ngo on so?  I'm afraid you may.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Solomon went off again, and dived into the hold.  But in a\r\nminute or two he was back again, and giggling, and glancing, and\r\nwhispering to himself, as before.  Solomon and Captain Corbet thus had\r\neach a different way of exhibiting the same emotion, for the feeling\r\nthat was thus variously displayed was nothing but the purest and most\r\nunfeigned joy.\r\n\r\n\"See yah, Mas'r Tom--and chil'n all,\" said Solomon, at last.  \"Ise\r\ngwine to pose dat we all go an tend to sometin ob de fust portance.\r\nHyah's Mas'r Tom habn't had notin to eat more'n a mont; an hyah's de\r\nres ob de blubbed breddern ob de Bee see double what been a fastin\r\nsince dey riz at free clock dis shinin and spicious morn. Dis yah's\r\ngreat an shinin casium, an should be honnad by great and strorny\r\nstivities.  Now, dar ain't no stivity dat can begin to hole a can'l to\r\na good dinna, or suppa, or sometin in de eatin line.  So Ise gwine to\r\npose to honna de cobbery ob de Probable Son by a rale ole-fashioned,\r\nstunnin breakfuss.  Don't be fraid dar'll be any ficiency hyah.  I got\r\ntings aboard dat I ben a savin for dis spicious an lightful cobbery.\r\nBen no eatin in dis vessel ebber sence de loss chile took his parter an\r\ndrifted off.  Couldn't get no pusson to tetch nuffin.  Got 'em all now;\r\nan so, blubbed breddern, let's sem'l once more, an ole Solomon'll now\r\nficiate in de pressive pacity ob Gran Pandledrum.  An I pose dat we\r\nrect a tent on de sho oh dis yah island, and hab de banket come off in\r\nfust chop style.\"\r\n\r\n\"The island!\" cried Tom, in horror.  \"What! the island?  Breakfast on\r\nthe island?  What a horrible proposal!  Look here, captain. Can't we\r\nget away from this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Get away from this?\" repeated the captain, in mild surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tom.  \"You see, the fact is, when a fellow's gone through\r\nwhat I have, he isn't over fond of the place where he's had that to go\r\nthrough.  And so this island is a horrible place to me, and I can't\r\nfeel comfortable till I get away out of sight of it. Breakfast!  Why,\r\nthe very thought of eating is abominable as long as that island is in\r\nsight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, railly, now,\" said Captain Corbet, \"I shouldn't wonder if thar\r\nwas a good deal in that, though I didn't think of it afore. Course it's\r\nnatral you shouldn't be over fond of sech, when you've had sech an\r\noncommon tough time.  An now, bein' as thar's no uthly occasion for the\r\nAntelope to be a lingerin' round this here isle of the ocean, I muve\r\nthat we histe anchor an resume our vyge.  It's nigh onto a fortnight\r\nsence we fust started for Petticoat Jack, and sence that time we've had\r\nrare and strikin vycissitoods.  It may jest happen that some on ye may\r\nbe tired of the briny deep, an may wish no more to see the billers\r\nbound and scatter their foamin spray; some on ye likewise may be out o'\r\nsperrits about the fog. In sech a case, all I got to say is, that this\r\nhere schooner'll be very happy to land you at the nighest port, Scott's\r\nBay, frincense, from which you may work your way by land to your\r\ndesired haven. Sorry would I be to part with ye, specially in this here\r\nmoment of jy; but ef ye've got tired of the Antelope, tain't no\r\nmore'n's natral.  Wal, now,--what d'ye say--shall we go up to Scott's\r\nBay, or will ye contenoo on to Petticoat Jack, an accomplitch the\r\nriginal vyge as per charter party?\"\r\n\r\nThe boys said nothing, but looked at Tom as though referring the\r\nquestion to him.\r\n\r\n\"As far as I am concerned,\" said Tom, who noticed this reference to\r\nhim, \"it's a matter of indifference where we go, so long as we go out\r\nof sight of this island.  If the rest prefer landing at Scott's Bay,\r\nI'm agreed; at the same time, I'd just as soon go on to Petitcodiac.\"\r\n\r\n\"An what do the rest o' ye say?\" asked the captain, somewhat anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said Bruce, \"I think it's about the best thing we can\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nThe others all expressed similar sentiments, and Captain Corbet\r\nlistened to this with evident delight.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said he, \"and hooray!  Solomon, my aged friend, we will\r\nhave our breakfast on board, as we glide past them thar historic\r\nshores.  Pile on what you have, and make haste.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more the anchor was up, and the Antelope was under way.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour Solomon summoned them below, where he laid before\r\nthem a breakfast that cast into the shade Tom's most elaborate meal on\r\nthe island.  With appetites that seemed to have been growing during the\r\nwhole period of Tom's absence, the joyous company sat down to that\r\nrepast, while Solomon moved around, his eyes glistening, his face\r\nshining, his teeth grinning, and his hips moving, as, after his\r\nfashion, he whispered little Solomonian pleasantries to his own\r\naffectionate heart.  At this repast the boys began a fresh series of\r\nquestions, and drew from Tom a full, complete, and exhaustive history\r\nof his island life, more particularly with regard to his experience in\r\nhouse-building, and housekeeping; and with each one, without exception,\r\nit was a matter of sincere regret that it had not been his lot to be\r\nTom's companion in the boat and on the island.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they came up on deck.  The wind had at length changed,\r\nas Captain Corbet had prophesied in the morning, and the sky overhead\r\nwas clear.  Down the bay still might be seen the fog banks, but near at\r\nhand all was bright.  Behind them Ile Haute was already at a respectful\r\ndistance, and Cape Chignecto was near.\r\n\r\n\"My Christian friends,\" said Captain Corbet, solemnly,--\"my Christian\r\nfriends, an dear boys.  Agin we resoom the thread of our eventfool\r\nvyge, that was brok of a suddent in so onparld a manner. Agin we\r\ngullide o'er the foamin biller like a arrer shot from a cross-bow, an\r\nculleave the briny main.  We have lived, an we have suffered, but now\r\nour sufferins seem to be over.  At last we have a fair wind, with a\r\ntide to favor us, an we'll be off Hillsborough before daybreak\r\nto-morrer.  An now I ask you all, young sirs, do you feel any regretses\r\nover the eventfool past?  I answer, no.  An wan't I right?  Didn't I\r\nsay that that thar lad would onst more show his shinin face amongst us,\r\nright side up, with care, in good order an condition, as when shipped\r\non board the Antelope, Corbet master, from Grand Pre, an bound for\r\nPetticoat Jack?  Methinks I did.  Hence the vally of a lofty sperrit in\r\nthe face of difficulties.  An now, young sirs, in after life take\r\nwarnin by this here vyge.  Never say die.  Don't give up the ship.  No\r\nsurrender.  England expects every man to do his dooty.  For him that\r\nrises superior to succumstances is terewly great; an by presarvin a\r\nmagnanumous mind you'll be able to hold up your heads and smile amid\r\nthe kerrash of misfortin.  Now look at me.  I affum, solemn, that all\r\nthe sufferins I've suffered have ben for my good; an so this here vyge\r\nhas eventooated one of the luckiest vyges that you've ever had.  An\r\nthus,\" he concluded, stretching out his venerable hands with the air of\r\none giving a benediction,--\"thus may it be with the vyge of life.  May\r\nall its storms end in calms, an funnish matter in the footoor for balmy\r\nrettuspect.  Amen!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a close approach to a sermon; and though the words were a little\r\nincoherent, yet the tone was solemn, and the intention good. After this\r\nthe captain dropped the lofty part of a Mentor, and mingled with the\r\nboys as an equal.\r\n\r\nThis time the voyage passed without any accident.  Before daybreak on\r\nthe following morning they reached Hillsborough, where Mrs. Watson\r\nreceived them with the utmost joy.  In a few days more the boys had\r\nscattered, and Bart arrived home with the story of Tom's rescue.",
