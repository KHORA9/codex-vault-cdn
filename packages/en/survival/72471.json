This is not the place, nor would it be becoming on my part to\r\ntell what has been effected. We had the happy fortune to find things\r\nat their lowest ebb. We could hardly make a change without making an\r\nimprovement. In all these improvements Major Robert Hanbury Brown,\r\nR.E., has from the first occupied a conspicuous place. Few Englishmen\r\nhave gone through so many summer seasons as he has, in the blazing\r\nheat of Upper Egypt. For that has been his field of labour, and of\r\nthat field the fertile, abnormal, neglected, quaint old Province of\r\nthe Fayûm forms a part. Truly, an old world province! whose historical\r\nroll carries us back to very early days, before that venerable Sheikh\r\nAbraham had made his emigration from Assyrian Haran—a province\r\nabundantly watered, and therefore rich, and highly prized by Pharaoh\r\nand Ptolemy, Cæsar and Arab Khalif, until Mameluke misrule and Turkish\r\nbrutish ignorance let it fall into decay.\r\n\r\nIt has fallen to Major Brown to help to restore the Fayûm, and he has\r\nthus obtained a very intimate knowledge of it. He is not the first\r\nauthor on this subject. Learned Germans and brilliant Frenchmen have\r\nalready written on the Fayûm. Major Brown pretends neither to the\r\nlearning of the one, nor to the brilliancy of the other, but he has,\r\nwhat neither one nor the other ever had, an accurate knowledge of the\r\nlevels of the country. This information is quite indispensable to the\r\nhydraulic engineer, and it is strange that that distinguished Frenchman\r\nM. Linant de Bellefonds, who devoted so many years to the physical\r\nimprovement of Egypt, should have been evidently without it.\r\n\r\nOf course Major Brown could not write of the Fayûm without introducing\r\nthe mystic Lake Mœris. Herodotus does not lie when he tells of the\r\nthings he has actually seen, and he says he saw Lake Mœris. So it must\r\nhave existed. But where was it? That is the question that has been\r\nasked from one generation to another.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages Major Brown, in simple, straightforward\r\nlanguage, gives his opinion, and the reader may be sure that he does\r\nnot talk of what he does not know. Whether his conclusions are correct\r\nor not, this account of the Fayûm is an important addition to our\r\nknowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\n                              COLIN SCOTT-MONCRIEFF,\r\n          _Late Under-Secretary of State, Public Works Ministry, Cairo._\r\n\r\nLONDON, _September 1st_, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION                                                         1\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  THE FAYÛM OF TO-DAY                                                  5\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  ANCIENT TESTIMONY ABOUT LAKE MŒRIS                                  19\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  THEORIES AS TO WHERE AND WHAT LAKE MŒRIS WAS                        25\r\n\r\n    GENERAL REMARKS, 25 — LINANT THEORY, 28 — COPE WHITEHOUSE\r\n    THEORY, 40 — LINANT’S OBJECTIONS TO THEORY FAVOURED, 48 —\r\n    W.

The benefits resulting to the land of Egypt from such\r\na moderator of high and low Niles were supposed to have been great,\r\nand the idea of the possibility of restoring the boon to Egypt by the\r\ndiscovery of the true position of the ancient Lake Mœris has helped\r\nto increase the interest in the subject, which curiosity about one\r\nof the lost wonders of the world in the once glorious kingdom of\r\nthe Pharaohs would alone have been sufficient to excite.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a long letter to Mr. Paul Ascherson about a journey\r\nin the Fayûm, Dr. Schweinfurth writes:—“It must have already\r\noccurred to you, that I, in these already much too comprehensive\r\nremarks, have kept going round about the Mœris question, like a\r\ncat round hot broth. I must guard myself from pulling unripe fruit,\r\nwhich in a not far future will be ripe for judgment.” This was\r\nwritten in January 1886. Dr. Schweinfurth seemed to expect that\r\ndiscoveries of papyri in the ruins of Arsinoë would be made, and\r\nthe riddle by them be solved. We are still waiting for the papyri.\r\n\r\nThough the fear of picking unripe fruit may produce an unfavourable\r\nstate of mind for assisting to promote discussion, it is far\r\npreferable to M. Linant’s attitude with reference to this question,\r\nwhen he stated that “J’ai retrouvé la véritable situation de\r\ncet ancien lac ou réservoir d’eau,” and caused or allowed to\r\nbe printed on the “Carte Hydrographique de la moyenne Égypte, par\r\nM. Linant de Bellefonds, Paris, 1854,” the following presumptuous\r\nand decidedly untrue statement: “Le mémoire publié par M. Linant,\r\nsur le lac Mœris, donne tous les éclaircissements désirables sur\r\nce point de l’histoire ancienne de l’Égypte”!\r\n\r\nThough more illumination has been thrown on the subject since\r\nthis unfounded claim to finality was made, there still remains much\r\ninformation to collect about doubtful points of levels, identification\r\nof old ruined towns, and so forth, but I do not on that account\r\nconsider that the fear of “too hastily confusing” the question\r\nshould forbid the publication of fresh facts and speculations thereon,\r\nso long as the door is not slammed in the face of those who prefer\r\nto give their support to other theories.\r\n\r\nI will briefly state the order, and reasons for the order, in which\r\nI have arranged the different parts into which this paper is divided.\r\n\r\nI have described the “Fayûm of To-day” first, as a conception of\r\nits condition in the past must of necessity be founded on a knowledge\r\nof its condition in the present.\r\n\r\nNext I give the statements made by the ancient travellers, as it is\r\nupon them that the ideas, of what Lake Mœris was, are based.\r\n\r\nI then proceed to try and dispose of theories which I consider\r\nerroneous, so as to clear the way for a more correct view; or at\r\nleast to expose some of the errors of statement which might mislead\r\nothers into accepting or forming wrong notions on the subject. Next\r\nI give the views that I have adopted, and point out what support\r\nthey have from others, and discuss M. Linant’s objections to the\r\nviews favoured.\r\n\r\nThen I have endeavoured to sketch the history of the Fayûm—\r\n\r\n  (1)  Before it became Lake Mœris.\r\n\r\n  (2)  As Lake Mœris.\r\n\r\n  (3)  While it was undergoing the process of being transformed from\r\n       Lake Mœris to what it is to-day.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, I have added a few remarks about the possible future of\r\nthe Wadi Raiân, and the effect upon the Fayûm of a more abundant\r\nsupply of water in consequence of the construction of storage\r\nreservoirs now under consideration.\r\n\r\nI have made use of all previous writings on the subject that I could\r\nlay hands on. Mr. Cope Whitehouse kindly lent me his papers and\r\nshowed me where to get others. Mr. Flinders Petrie has also given\r\nme what information I applied to him for. The maps and levelling of\r\nthe Fayûm, made under the direction of Lieut.-Col. J. C. Ross,\r\nC.M.G., late Inspector-General of Irrigation in Egypt, have\r\nnaturally been invaluable aids to the study of the subject. Sir\r\nColin Scott-Moncrieff, late Under-Secretary of State for Public\r\nWorks, Egypt, has also given me his views on some points raised in\r\nthis paper, and I have taken advantage of them. Miss M. Brodrick\r\nhas most kindly assisted me in the correction of the proofs, and\r\nin other matters connected with the publication of this paper. Ali\r\nBey Borhan, Chief Engineer of the Fayûm, and Monsieur A. Pini,\r\nin charge of works, have assisted me by collecting information and\r\nobtaining levels that were wanting.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish to lay claim to no originality in the views\r\nadopted. What I have aimed at in this paper is to work those\r\nviews out, and to go more thoroughly into them than has hitherto\r\nbeen done, thereby making a contribution to the discussion of an\r\nunsolved problem, interesting alike to Engineers, Archæologists,\r\nand Classical Scholars.\r\n\r\nAs the metrical system is in use in Egypt, all dimensions and\r\nquantities are given throughout this paper in metres and cubic metres,\r\nand distances in kilometres.\r\n\r\n  1 metre         = 3·2809 feet.\r\n\r\n  1 square metre  = 10·7643 square feet.\r\n\r\n  1 cubic metre   = 35·3166 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n                  = 220·097 gallons.\r\n\r\n  8 kilometres    = 5 miles (approximately).\r\n\r\nDischarges are given as so many cubic metres per day of 24 hours.\r\n\r\n  1,000,000 cubic metres a day  = 11·5741 cubic metres per second.\r\n\r\n                                = 408·9775 cubic feet per second.\r\n\r\nAreas are given in feddans, which is the Egyptian acre.\r\n\r\n  1 feddan  = 4200·8333 square metres.\r\n\r\n            = 1·038 acre.\r\n\r\nR.L. signifies “reduced level,” or the level referred to mean\r\nsea-level:—e.g. “at R.L. 25·00” means that the spot, to which\r\nthe figure relates, is 25 metres above mean sea-level; and “R.L. -\r\n40·00” means 40 metres below mean sea-level.\r\n\r\nA contour is the line running through all the points which are at\r\nthe same level above or below mean sea-level.\r\n\r\nAn Egyptian pound, L.E., = 1¹⁄₃₉ English pound, £.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                         THE FAYÛM OF TO-DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Position of the Fayûm with reference to the Nile Valley._—About\r\n50 miles south of Cairo, a branch line leaves the Upper Egypt line\r\nof railway and goes west. After crossing the Basin land of the Nile\r\nValley, it enters the western desert, and after a short ascent and\r\nsomewhat longer descent, it reaches the station of Edwah in the\r\nProvince of The Fayûm.\r\n\r\nThis province is the most remarkable and interesting of all the\r\nprovinces of Egypt. It is an oasis surrounded by desert, being\r\nseparated from the Nile Valley by four to twelve kilometres width of\r\nthe Libyan Desert, and being connected with it by a narrow neck of\r\ncultivation marking the gap in the Libyan Hills, by which the Bahr\r\nYûsuf enters the Fayûm.\r\n\r\n_Depressions connected with the Fayûm._—Forming part of this\r\nprovince, and included in it administratively, is the Gharaq Basin\r\nor depression, which is partly cultivated, but surrounded by desert\r\nlands above the present limits of irrigation, and in communication\r\nwith the Fayûm by a narrow neck at R.L. 16·00 (16 metres above\r\nmean sea-level).\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the Gharaq Basin is another more considerable depression\r\nwith an area of about one-quarter that of the Fayûm (at contour\r\nR.L. 25·00). This depression, known as the Wadi Raiân, had attention\r\ndrawn to it by Mr. Cope Whitehouse, who proposed its utilisation as\r\na reservoir for controlling the Nile floods, and supplementing the\r\nlow summer Nile. This Wadi is now bare desert. Its lowest point is\r\n40 metres below sea-level, and the depression thus corresponds, as a\r\ngeological formation, with the Fayûm depression, the lowest point of\r\nwhich (the bed of Lake Qurûn), is known to be not less than 48, and\r\nis perhaps as much as 60 metres below mean sea-level, but soundings\r\nare required to establish the actuality of the greater depth.\r\n\r\nThe Wadi Raiân is surrounded by hills, on all sides rising above\r\nthe level of + 36, except at two gaps in the hills separating it\r\nfrom the Gharaq Basin, which have their sills at R.L. 27·00 and\r\n26·00 respectively.\r\n\r\n_The Fayûm Depression._—The Fayûm Province has the shape of a\r\nleaf, (see Plate XIX.) of which the Bahr Yûsuf, from its entrance\r\nat Lahûn to its end at Medineh, forms the stalk, and the different\r\ncanals, branching from Medineh, the veins. The province is generally\r\ndescribed as being formed of three plateaux, but this description\r\ncan only properly be applied to that part of the Fayûm, most rich in\r\nNile deposit, which lies between the main south drain (Wadi Nezlah)\r\nand the main north-east drain (the Bahr Bilamâ or Wadi Tamîyah).\r\n\r\nThe lower section given on Plate XI., which is typical of this part\r\nof the Fayûm, shows the three plateaux, and gives the different\r\nsurface inclinations. The contoured diagram, Plate XIX., also shows\r\nthe conformation of the Fayûm Province.\r\n\r\nThe two strips of land outside the main drainage lines have a\r\ndifferent character, and considerably less Nile deposit (see Map).\r\n\r\nMedineh, the chief town of the Fayûm, from which most of its canals\r\nand roads radiate, stands on ground (R.L. 22·50) three to four\r\nmetres lower than the land of the Nile Valley in the neighbourhood\r\nof Lahûn, where the Bahr Yûsuf turns westward to enter the Fayûm.\r\n\r\nFrom Medineh for 8 kilometres the country surface slope is 1\r\nin 1400, for the next 4 kilometres 1 in 666, and then 1 in 150,\r\ntill the Birket-el-Qurûn (Lake of the Horns) is reached. This\r\nlake occupies the lowest part of the Fayûm, and at the beginning\r\nof 1892 its water surface level was 43·30 metres below mean sea;\r\nwhile the bed of the lake is 5 metres lower at least.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Fayûm and Wadi Raiân together are everywhere encircled by\r\na continuous range of hills, except where the Bahr Yûsuf enters\r\nthrough the gap in the Libyan Hills, and also towards the north of\r\nthe Fayûm, where the height of the hills becomes less, but where\r\nthere is probably no gap lower than R.L. 30, though this has not\r\nbeen actually established by levelling.\r\n\r\n_The Birket-el-Qurûn and Evaporation._—Such being the physical\r\nfeatures of the Fayûm, it is evident that there is no outflow for\r\nthe drainage of the province. All the drainage (except that of the\r\nGharaq Basin) finds its way into the Birket-el-Qurûn and there\r\nevaporates. The present surface area of the lake is not accurately\r\nknown, but being about 40 kilometres long by 5 broad, the area is\r\nabout 200 square kilometres (78 square miles).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the considerable quantity of water that drains into\r\nthe lake during the twelve months of the year, its level has fallen\r\nsteadily of late years. The following table gives the measure of\r\nthe fall from the first of March of one year to the first of March\r\nof the next.\r\n\r\n                          LEVEL ON 1ST MARCH.\r\n\r\n  Year.

Linant\r\nPasha states in his ‘Mémoires’ that Vansleb, who was in the\r\nFayûm in 1673, said that one embarked at Sanhûr to pass to the\r\nother side of the lake. Dead tamarisk bushes standing in the water\r\nseem to prove that the lake has in the past been lower by a metre\r\nor more than it is at present, for these tamarisks grow along the\r\nmargin of the lake above the water edge, but not in it.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the lake is not continuous throughout the year, but\r\ngenerally takes place from the 1st March to the 31st October; the\r\nlevel rises from the 1st November to the end of January, and remains\r\nstationary during February.\r\n\r\nIf the area of the lake were more accurately determined, there are\r\nseveral problems of interest connected with evaporation and the\r\n“duty” of water which might be calculated out from the facts\r\nknown about the fall of this lake, the level of which is recorded\r\ndaily. The discharge entering the Fayûm throughout the year is known,\r\nas also approximately the areas under crop; but while the area of the\r\nlake remains so vaguely guessed at, the results of the calculation\r\nwould be of little value, as the figure representing the lake area\r\nis an important factor in the calculations.\r\n\r\nBut the following figures give a measure of what the daily evaporation\r\nis in June and July, at least approximately:—\r\n\r\nIn 1889 and 1890, when there were exceptionally short summer supplies,\r\nand the drainage into Lake Qurûn must have been as little as it\r\never is, the lake levels were as follow:—\r\n\r\n  --+----------------+---------------+-----------+----------------+--\r\n    |     Date.      | Level of Lake.|  Fall in  | Daily Average. |\r\n    |                |     R.L.      |  30 Days. |                |\r\n    +----------------+---------------+-----------+----------------+\r\n    |1st June, 1889  |   - 41·63     |           |                |\r\n    |                |               |           |                |\r\n    |1st July „      |   - 41·87     |    ·24    |     ·008       |\r\n    |                |               |           |                |\r\n    |31st July „     |   - 42·11     |    ·24    |     ·008       |\r\n    |                |               |           |                |\r\n    |1st June, 1890  |   - 42·38     |           |                |\r\n    |                |               |           |                |\r\n    |1st July „      |   - 42·66     |    ·28    |     ·0093      |\r\n    |                |               |           |                |\r\n    |31st July „     |   - 42·89     |    ·24    |     ·008       |\r\n  --+----------------+---------------+-----------+----------------+--\r\n\r\nThe evaporation, then, could not have been less than ·0093 of a\r\nmetre per diem in June 1890; or less than ·008 per diem in June\r\nand July 1889 and July 1890.\r\n\r\nAllowing for a slight amount of drainage finding its way into the\r\nlake, an estimate of 1 centimetre a day for evaporation during the\r\nthree hottest months of the summer would seem to be nearly correct.\r\n\r\nWe have also the following figures:—\r\n\r\n                                                  R.L.\r\n\r\n  On 14th March, 1890, the lake level was      - 42·00\r\n\r\n  On 18th September, 1890       „              - 43·13\r\n                                                 -----\r\n  The fall in 188 days was therefore              1·13\r\n                                                 -----\r\n  Giving a daily average of                       ·006\r\n\r\nAs, for half this period, the flow of water into the lake must have\r\nbeen considerable, the average fall per diem due to evaporation for\r\nthese six months must have been certainly over 6 millimetres.\r\n\r\nObservations on evaporation made in the Abassieh Observatory in Cairo\r\ngive the following figures as the measure of the average evaporation\r\nfor each month of the year:—\r\n\r\n                       Metres.\r\n\r\n  January               ·071\r\n\r\n  February              ·074\r\n\r\n  March                 ·172\r\n\r\n  April                 ·193\r\n\r\n  May                   ·252\r\n\r\n  June                  ·299 }\r\n                             } Average per diem\r\n  July                  ·370 } for three hottest\r\n                             }  months, ·0107.\r\n  August                ·310 }\r\n\r\n  September             ·226\r\n\r\n  October               ·179\r\n\r\n  November              ·120\r\n\r\n  December              ·098\r\n                       -----\r\n           Total       2·364 metres per annum.\r\n\r\nThe average per diem for the three hottest months of the year,\r\naccording to these observations, is ·0107, as against ·01 deduced\r\nfrom observations of the levels of Lake Qurûn. The figure given for\r\nJuly in the above list is higher than I should have expected, as the\r\nevaporation of that month I should estimate to be very slightly in\r\nexcess of that of June or August; that is, about 1 centimetre a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\nTHE BAHR YÛSUF, SKIRTING THE LIBYAN DESERT, IN THE NILE VALLEY.]\r\n\r\n_The Bahr Yûsuf outside the Fayûm._—The Bahr Yûsuf (Canal of\r\nJoseph) is the watercourse that carries the Fayûm supply. It is\r\nnot an artificial canal, but a naturally formed sinuous channel,\r\nresulting from the Nile flood water draining off the lands and\r\nfollowing the line of least resistance along the low-lying part of the\r\nNile Valley on the side of the Libyan Desert. Plate I. shows where\r\nthe Bahr Yûsuf touches the desert and forms a line of separation\r\nbetween the fertile land of the Nile Valley with its grateful shade\r\nof trees and the barren desert sands under a scorching sun.\r\n\r\nAs is usual in the case of rivers which periodically overflow their\r\nbanks, the land is highest alongside the Nile, and slopes away\r\nfrom it to the hills on either side. The high margins of the Nile\r\nare known in Egypt as the “Sahel.” As the Bahr Yûsuf has for a\r\ngreat many years been given an artificial connection with the Nile,\r\nand been used as a channel to carry flood water to inundate the\r\nlands along its course on both sides, it has imitated the Nile in\r\nits action on its borders, and raised a “Sahel” of its own on a\r\nsmaller scale. The cross-section of the Nile Valley is thus roughly\r\nrepresented in the following diagram.\r\n\r\nA former artificial connection of the Bahr Yûsuf with the Nile is\r\nplainly visible at Derût, 200 kilometres farther up the Nile Valley\r\nthan Lahûn, the point at which the Bahr Yûsuf turns westward into\r\nthe Fayûm. The artificial part is easily distinguished from the\r\nnatural channel, as the former is straight with high spoil banks,\r\nresulting from the earth excavated to form the channel, whereas the\r\nlatter is sinuous without any signs of spoil banks. The length of\r\nthe channel from Derût to Lahûn, measured along its windings, is\r\n270 kilometres, as against 200 kilometres measured as the crow flies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA second artificial connection with the Nile farther south was made at\r\nManfalût by the excavation of a channel 30 kilometres in length. The\r\npart of this that remains now is called the “Manfalûtîyah” or\r\n“old Bahr Yûsuf.” About twenty years ago a large canal, called\r\nthe Ibrahimîyah, was made for the irrigation of the Khedive Ismail\r\nPasha’s large sugar-cane plantations. It was made to take off from\r\nthe Nile at Asyût, 30 kilometres above Manfalût and 61 kilometres\r\nabove Derût. It absorbed part of the Manfalûtîyah Canal from\r\nBeni Qora to Derût. At Derût, regulators of a fine description\r\nwere constructed for the distribution of the water, and a regulator\r\nof five openings of three metres’ span, with a lock 8·50 metres\r\nwide, was made as the head work of the Bahr Yûsuf, which under the\r\nnew nomenclature became a branch of the Ibrahimîyah Canal. When the\r\nIbrahimîyah Canal was first opened, it appears from the Mémoires\r\non Public Works, published by Linant de Bellefonds Bey in 1872-73,\r\nthat its discharge was small compared with its present discharge,\r\nand the Fayûm summer irrigation must have been limited. M. Linant\r\nstates that the bed width of the main Ibrahimîyah was 35 metres,\r\nand its reputed depth in summer 1·50 metres; but, in consequence\r\nof the inefficient means of dredging, a depth of one metre at most\r\nwas all that could be obtained at the lowest level of the Nile;\r\nand he calculates that the minimum discharge, which theoretically\r\nshould have reached Derût, was 666,840 cubic metres per 24 hours\r\n(273 cubic feet a second), but, in consequence of the inefficient\r\ndredging, no more than 369,624 cubic metres per 24 hours (151 cubic\r\nfeet a second) were delivered. Under present conditions in the worst\r\nyears the minimum has never fallen below two million cubic metres\r\nper 24 hours (818 cubic feet a second) since, at any rate, 1883.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\nBRIDGE CARRYING THE BAZAAR STREET, MEDINET EL FAYÛM, OVER THE\r\nBAHR YÛSUF.]\r\n\r\nOf the Bahr Yûsuf before the Ibrahimîyah Canal was made, M. Linant\r\nremarks in the same Mémoires, that “it is the only canal in Egypt\r\nwhich, without receiving water from the river during the summer,\r\nnevertheless has enough to serve for the irrigation of the Fayûm\r\nfrom the springs in its bed.” These springs still supplement\r\nthe summer supply of the Fayûm by adding to the discharge, which\r\nis apportioned to the Bahr Yûsuf at Derût, about a quarter of a\r\nmillion cubic metres a day (102 cubic feet a second).\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and winter the water of the Bahr Yûsuf is (with\r\nthe exception of an insignificant quantity lifted for the irrigation\r\nof small areas at different points along its course) reserved for\r\nthe Fayûm, but during the flood season its channel is used to carry\r\nwater for the inundation of the lands on both sides of it, and later\r\nit is made use of as the channel of discharge for the basins which\r\nit has filled, or helped to fill.\r\n\r\nAt Lahûn, where the Bahr Yûsuf turns into the Fayûm, the quantity\r\nof water admitted is controlled by two regulators. The lower bridge\r\nis a very ancient one (frontispiece), of what date is unknown. Its\r\nfloor in Linant Pasha’s time had already partly given way, but from\r\nhis description it would seem to be now in the same state in which it\r\nwas more than twenty years ago. The upstream half has evidently been\r\nadded to the downstream half, as there is a clean line of separation\r\nin the middle of the length of the present archway. This is only to\r\nbe seen by entering the passage below the arches, as the junction\r\nis not visible from above.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Linant Pasha caused the second regulator of three openings\r\n(two of three metres’ and one of four metres’ span) to be\r\nconstructed as a precaution 80 metres above the old one, and it was\r\na very wise precaution to take. The head of water is now divided\r\nbetween the two bridges so that the action is less severe than it\r\nwas before the second bridge was constructed.\r\n\r\nThe present discharges passed by these regulators into the Fayûm\r\nare:—\r\n\r\nDuring the flood season 6½ to 7 million cubic metres per day (2658\r\nto 2863 cubic feet per second).\r\n\r\nDuring the winter season 3 million cubic metres per day (1227 cubic\r\nfeet per second).\r\n\r\nDuring the summer season 1½ to 1 million cubic metres per day\r\n(713 to 409 cubic feet per second).\r\n\r\nThe ordinary and maximum and minimum levels of the Bahr Yûsuf are\r\ngiven in the list below:—\r\n\r\n --+--------------+--------------+----------------+------------------+--\r\n   |              | Below Derût. |   Above New    | Below Old Bridge |\r\n   |              |              | Bridge, Lahûn. |  on Fayûm Side.  |\r\n   |              +--------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n   | Flood season |    46·75     |     26·50      |      23·90       |\r\n   |              |              |                |                  |\r\n   | Winter       |    43·00     |     24·14      |      23·15       |\r\n   |              |              |                |                  |\r\n   | Summer       |    42·15     |     22·90      |      22·50       |\r\n   |              |              |                |                  |\r\n   | Maximum      |    46·95     |     27·80      |      23·90       |\r\n   |              |              |                |                  |\r\n   | Minimum      |    41·67     |     22·50      |      22·27       |\r\n --+--------------+--------------+----------------+------------------+--\r\n\r\n_The Bahr Yûsuf inside the Fayûm._—At the end of the Bahr Yûsuf\r\nat Medineh the water-level is now kept constantly at R.L. 21·70 to\r\n21·80. In Nile time any increase on this tail level is forbidden by\r\nthe effect of the heading-up caused by the obstructions met with by\r\nthe large flood discharge in its passage through the town between the\r\nhouses which line its edges. The Bahr Yûsuf is bridged in this length\r\ntwice, first by a three-arched bridge, Plate II., which carries the\r\nmain street and bazaar of Medineh; and again by a two-tubed tunnel,\r\nover which the mosque of Kait Bey is built, Plate III.\r\n\r\nIn passing through the bazaar with shops on either side the Bahr\r\nYûsuf is crossed without its being noticed, and a stranger to the\r\ntown is presently surprised to find himself on the other side of\r\nthe canal to which he imagined himself to be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nTUNNEL ON BAHR YÛSUF,\r\n\r\nOVER WHICH THE KAIT BEY MOSQUE IN MEDINET EL FAYÛM IS BUILT.]\r\n\r\nThe waterways of these two constructions are sufficient to pass\r\nthe winter discharge with but slight heading-up, but when the flood\r\nsupply is flowing, they (assisted perhaps by old blocks of masonry\r\nand débris of fallen houses in the channel) cause a backing-up of\r\nthe water of from 50 to 60 centimetres and thereby (with the level\r\nat the tail below the town fixed at R.L. 21·80) produce the maximum\r\nlevel above the town, which it is safe to allow.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Lahûn to the end of the Bahr Yûsuf at Medineh\r\nalong the canal is 24 kilometres (15 miles). Between kilometre\r\n11 and 14 the bed is rock, the highest point of the bed being at\r\nR.L. 21·00 and between kilometre 12 and 13. The bed elsewhere is\r\ngenerally between R.L. 17 and 19.\r\n\r\nAt kilometre 10·130, the Bahr (canal) Sêlah takes off on the\r\nright, and after flowing by the Hawârah pyramid and passing under\r\nthe Fayûm railway, its water surface comes level with the soil and\r\nirrigates the strip of land bordering the Fayûm depression on the\r\nright of the main drainage line on this side.\r\n\r\nSimilarly at kilometre 15·5 the Bahr Gharaq takes off on the left of\r\nthe Bahr Yûsuf, and, aided by the Bahr Qalamshah, irrigates the east\r\nslope of the Fayûm and the whole of the Gharaq Basin. The strip on\r\nthe left of the south main drainage line, forming the sloping side\r\nof the Fayûm Basin on the south, is irrigated by the Bahr Nezlah,\r\nwhich takes off from the main canal at kilometre 16·370.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Bahr Tamîyah, which flows in the channel\r\nof the north-east main drain itself and irrigates the distant north\r\ncorner of the province on the right of the drain, all the other\r\ncanals irrigate the central part of the Fayûm, which lies between\r\nthe two main drainage lines. These canals may be divided into three\r\nclasses corresponding to the three plateaux:—\r\n\r\n1. The short and high level canals irrigating the high land on both\r\nsides of the Bahr Yûsuf and round Medineh, roughly speaking all\r\nlands down to contour R.L. 18·00.\r\n\r\n2. The medium canals, which irrigate between R.L. 18·00 and 10·00\r\nor thereabouts.\r\n\r\n3. The long ravine canals, which carry water to the distant parts\r\nof the Fayûm below contour R.L. 10·00.\r\n\r\nIn a lawless province like the Fayûm, such an arrangement of canals\r\nis of great assistance in the equal distribution of water to all\r\nparts of the province. The long canals of class 3 are, in their\r\nupper reaches, so far below the cultivated surface of the soil,\r\nthat no crop-owner of the first and second plateaux would attempt to\r\nirrigate from them except by means of water-wheels, which have to be\r\nregularly licensed. The canals of the 2nd class are intermediate in\r\nlevel and length between the first and third, and do not conveniently\r\nirrigate, except at some considerable distance from their heads.\r\n\r\nThere is a further advantage gained by the water of the long canals\r\nfalling at once to low levels at their commencement. Along the margins\r\nof the Bahr Yûsuf and round about Medineh is a considerable area\r\nof valuable land above the highest level reached by the water in the\r\nparent canal. To irrigate this, water is lifted in pitchers fastened\r\nto the side of the outer edge of undershot wheels, which are turned by\r\nthe force of the water descending to the low-level beds of the ravine\r\ncanals. These wheels turn day and night without ceasing, so long as\r\nthere is sufficient water. A head of 25 centimetres is sufficient\r\nto turn an ordinary wheel which lifts the water about 2 metres, but\r\nwhen greater heads are obtainable, water is lifted in this way as\r\nmuch as from 4 to 6 metres (Plate IV.) A fall of 80 centimetres will\r\nwork two wheels, one behind the other, which lift the water 5 metres.\r\n\r\nThe channel, carried by the imposing looking aqueduct of Plate\r\nIV., is only 40 centimetres wide by 30 centimetres high, the whole\r\nthickness of the aqueduct being only 85 centimetres. The expense,\r\nincurred in building it, points to the value of a constant stream\r\nof water raised in this manner.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of wheels used, one in which the water lifted\r\nis contained in earthenware jars fastened to the side of the wheel\r\nnear its outer edge, the arrangement of which is shown by the\r\ndrawing, reproduced from Willcocks’ ‘Egyptian Irrigation’\r\n(Plate V.) The other kind of wheel, called a _tabût_, has a hollow\r\nchambered tube of square cross-section forming its circumference,\r\nthe holes to admit water into each chamber being made in such a\r\nposition that the water, which enters the chamber when submerged,\r\ndoes not commence to flow out again, till the chamber approaches\r\nthe highest point of its path. Below the point, at which the flow\r\nout commences, a trough is placed to catch the water.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in both these arrangements there is a loss of\r\nwork in lifting the greater part of the water rather higher than\r\nthe level at which it is utilised. The principle of the tabût\r\nwill be understood from the drawing given on the same plate No. V.,\r\nas the other arrangement with pitchers. Either kind is known as a\r\n_saqya hedêr_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nHIGH-LIFT WATER-WHEELS ON THE TAMÎYAH CANAL.\r\n\r\nThe pair of wheels shown on this Plate raise the water 4·50 metres,\r\nand are worked by a total fall of water of 0·55 metres.\r\n\r\nAs a means of estimating the heights and widths in the Plate, the\r\nwidths of the arches are given.\r\n\r\nLeft-hand arch, 3 metres span; next arch on its right, 2½ metres span.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\nUNDERSHOT WHEEL FOR RAISING WATER.\r\n\r\nScale ¹⁄₅₀. From Willcocks’ ‘Egyptian Irrigation.’]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH DIAGRAM OF TABÛT.\r\n\r\nDrawn with side as if transparent, to show water in compartment,\r\nand principle.]\r\n\r\nThe _saqya mawâshi_ (saqya worked by cattle) and the _shadûf_\r\nare also employed to a small extent, as elsewhere in Egypt, but only\r\nfor small areas.\r\n\r\nThere are 205 saqya hedêrs in the province. To obtain a license to\r\nerect one, the applicant has to pay L.E. 1 to get his application\r\naccepted, and L.E. 5 more, if the license is granted.\r\n\r\n_Water-mills._—The fall of the water is also used to turn mills\r\nfor grinding corn, of which there are 243 in the province, which\r\npaid as tax in 1891 a total of 810_l._ (L.E. 791).\r\n\r\nPlate VI. is from a photograph of one of the falls, below which are\r\nfirst a pair of tabût wheels, one behind the other, for lifting\r\nwater to high-level lands, and, below these in the same mill-race,\r\nan undershot wheel working a mill for grinding corn.\r\n\r\nThe mills are worked either by turbines (_panchakkis_) of a\r\npattern introduced from India thirty years ago, according to\r\nMr. Willcocks, or by undershot wheels. The latter method is used,\r\nwhere the fall available to work the mill is small, but not less\r\nthan 60 centimetres. The former system requires a fall of at least\r\n1·60 metres.\r\n\r\n_Falls and Regulators._—For purposes of irrigation the fall of\r\nthe country surface is excessive, and works have to be built at\r\nintervals along a canal, after the point where it begins to irrigate,\r\nto hold up the water-surface to a sufficient height to flow over\r\nthe fields. These works are generally placed where the canal splits\r\nup into branches, and they take the form of a collection of small\r\nweirs. Where the maximum water-levels below all the weirs of such\r\na group never rise above the level of their weir-sills we have a\r\n“free fall” in the case of each weir, and the discharge over\r\neach sill is directly proportional at all seasons to the length\r\nof the sill, which in each weir is made proportional to the area\r\nirrigated from the canal below the weir. Thus the collection of\r\nweirs not only holds up the water for the irrigation from the canal\r\nabove it, but acts automatically as a just distributor of water to\r\nthe canals below it. Such a group of weirs is called a _nasbah_,\r\nan Arabic word signifying “proportion.” The arrangement is\r\nthoroughly understood and appreciated by the Fayûm cultivators,\r\nand is useful in rendering unnecessary the employment of a numerous\r\nestablishment of low-paid agents—a great end to gain in a country\r\nwhere the inferior employés are so easily corrupted.\r\n\r\nThere are, besides the nasbahs, a large number of small masonry\r\nworks, as head regulators, sluice heads to branch canals, syphons,\r\naqueducts, and pipe heads scattered all over the province, but there\r\nis nothing peculiar in them as irrigation works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\nNASBAH MITERTARIS.]\r\n\r\nThe upper bridge at Lahûn has hitherto been closed by vertical\r\nneedles, but in 1892 it has been altered, and will in future be\r\nregulated by horizontal planks. The openings have also all been made\r\none width, namely, 3 metres.\r\n\r\n_Crops._—The area on which land tax was paid in 1891 was\r\n\r\n  Ushuri lands       131,155 feddans.\r\n\r\n  Kharagi „          102,146    „\r\n                     -------\r\n             Total   233,301    „\r\n\r\nThe total amount received into the Government treasury on this area\r\nwas L.E. 132,668, which gives an average of 57 piastres a feddan,\r\nor 11_s._ 2¾_d._ an acre.\r\n\r\nThe actually cultivated area of the Fayûm is said to be about\r\n280,000 feddans. Almost the whole of this area is under crop during\r\nthe flood season and winter, and about 50,000 to 60,000 feddans are\r\nplanted with summer crops, chiefly cotton.\r\n\r\nIf cotton is grown, it is followed by a winter crop of wheat, clover,\r\nor beans, and this is followed by a flood crop of millet. The cotton\r\nis sown in March of one year, and the flood millet is harvested in\r\nNovember of the following year, so that three crops are obtained\r\nin twenty months. After the flood millet, clover will be sown, and\r\nthis will be cleared off the ground in time to plant cotton, which\r\nwill be picked and finished with in October. This makes five crops\r\nin thirty-one months. I believe that sometimes even this record is\r\nbeaten, and three crops are got out of fifteen months.\r\n\r\nEverything which is sent out of the Fayûm, with the exception of\r\nan insignificant quantity which is carried out by camels, is shown\r\nin the railway books, from which the following figures, in kantars,\r\nhave been obtained.

Hence the\r\nvalue of cotton, cotton-seed, and cereals exported from the Fayûm\r\nin 1891 was at the rate of L.E. 4·397 a feddan (4_l._ 6_s._ 10_d._\r\nan acre).\r\n\r\nClover, which is extensively cultivated, is all consumed in the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, the Fayûm exports also figs, grapes, olives,\r\nquail, fish, mats, baskets, and a few other things.\r\n\r\nThe province is justly famed for its excellent figs, but the grapes\r\nare not of superior quality to those of other parts of Egypt, though\r\nthey have the reputation of being so.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Government farmed out the fisheries for a sum of\r\nL.E. 2000. Every day large numbers of fish, chiefly _bulti_\r\n(Nile carp) are sent in crates to Cairo. The bulti is excellent\r\neating. Another common fish is the _armûd_, or Nile shad-fish _alias_\r\nsheath-fish or cat-fish (_Silurus_). It is considered by the natives\r\nto be good to eat, but according to others it is not fit for food.\r\n\r\nAnother handsome fish, called by the fishermen _lâl_, and also a\r\nfine species of the perch family, known to them as _lafâsh_, both\r\nfrom their appearance good table fish, are not uncommon, except by\r\ncomparison with the abundant carp. The _lafâsh_ grows to a great\r\nsize, one that I photographed, measured, and weighed being 1·32\r\nmetres long, of 1 metre girth, and 92 lbs. weight.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen move about the lake in the most primitive kind of boats,\r\npropelled by the clumsiest possible oars, and without any sails. How\r\nlong they will continue to be satisfied with their craft it is hard\r\nto say, but they show no signs of desiring anything better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                  ANCIENT TESTIMONY ABOUT LAKE MŒRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence concerning the existence of Lake Mœris, which has been\r\nbriefly referred to in the Introduction, is to be gained from the\r\nfollowing sources:—\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian monuments, in which are found inscriptions on stone\r\nand records on papyri.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Herodotus, who visited Egypt B.C. 450.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Diodorus Siculus, a Sicilian, and of Strabo, a Greek\r\ngeographer and contemporary with Diodorus, about B.C. 25.\r\n\r\nLastly Pliny, A.D. 50 to 70.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind, while reading their accounts, that, in\r\nattempting to give information as to the origin of Lake Mœris, they\r\nwere undertaking a task beyond their powers, since, according to the\r\nscanty revelations of the monuments, which on this point are the only\r\nwitnesses worthy of credence, the Lake Mœris _existed_ 2000 years\r\nbefore Herodotus visited Egypt, and therefore must have been _formed_\r\nat a more remote date. What then these ancients may have been told\r\nas to the _origin_ of Lake Mœris may well be classed with tradition,\r\nand be assigned its true value as such, but what they state, that they\r\nthemselves _saw_, is as worthy of belief as statements found in the\r\ndescriptions of any other sober historian’s personal experiences.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the Rev. Edwin Meyrick, M.A., for the translations of\r\nthe passages from Herodotus, and to Mr. Edward Meyrick, of Marlborough\r\nCollege, for those from the other classics.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Translations from Ancient Authors, who have referred to Lake Mœris,\r\n                        and Arabic Tradition._\r\n\r\n                    HERODOTUS, Book II. (B.C. 454).\r\n\r\n“These twelve kings (who were governing Egypt at the time of\r\nwhich Herodotus was writing) agreed to leave a work which should\r\nmake their names remembered, and, uniting all their powers, they\r\nbuilt the Labyrinth, a little above the Lake Mœris, and situated as\r\nnearly as possible opposite the city called Crocodilopolis. (Here\r\nfollows a description of the Labyrinth, in which it is stated to\r\nsurpass the pyramids as a wonder of construction.)\r\n\r\n“Adjoining the angle where the Labyrinth ends, is a pyramid,\r\n240 feet high, on which large figures of animals are engraved. The\r\nentrance into this is subterranean.\r\n\r\n“Now, the Labyrinth being such as I have described, the lake,\r\nnamed that of Mœris, causes still greater astonishment, on the\r\nbank of which this Labyrinth was built. The perimeter of this lake\r\nmeasures 3600 stadii, which is the same thing as 60 schœni. This\r\nmeasure is nearly equal to the entire seaboard of the whole of Egypt.\r\n\r\n“This lake lies oblong north and south, being in its deepest part\r\n50 fathoms deep. It tells its own story that it is artificially made,\r\nfor about the middle of the lake stand two pyramids, out-topping the\r\nwater 50 fathoms each, and that part of them which is built under\r\nwater is as much more. On the top of each is a colossal figure\r\nin stone, seated on a throne. So these pyramids are 100 fathoms\r\nhigh. Now, 100 fathoms are exactly equal to a stadius, consisting\r\nof six plethra, seeing that the fathom is equal to 6 feet, or four\r\ncubits, a foot measuring four palms, a cubit six palms.\r\n\r\n“The water in the lake is not derived from local sources, for\r\nthe earth in that part is naturally excessively dry and waterless,\r\nbut it is brought in from the Nile by a canal. It takes six months\r\nfilling and six months flowing back. During the six months of the\r\nreturn flow, it yields a talent of silver each day to the Treasury,\r\nand during the flow in, twenty minæ from the fish.\r\n\r\n“The people of the country also told me that this lake on its\r\nwestern face, inland along the mountain which is over Memphis,\r\nhas an underground outlet into the Syrtis, which is in Libya. But\r\nwhen I nowhere saw the earth-mounds which came from this excavation\r\n(for this was much upon my mind) I questioned those who lived in the\r\nneighbourhood of the lake as to where the excavated material could\r\nbe. They told me that it had been carried out, and without difficulty\r\nthey led me to believe it. For I knew by report that a similar thing\r\nhad taken place in Nineveh, the city of the Assyrians. For burglars\r\ncontrived a plan to carry off the treasures of King Sardanapalus,\r\nson of Ninus, which were valuable and guarded in subterranean\r\ntreasuries. These burglars then, starting from their own dwellings,\r\nand calculating the distance, tunnelled to the palace. And when night\r\ncame on they carried out the material, which was removed from the\r\nexcavation into the river Tigris, which flows past Nineveh, until\r\nthey accomplished what they wished. In a similar way to this I heard\r\nthat the excavation also of the lake in Egypt had been carried out\r\n(except that it was done by daylight, not by night), inasmuch as\r\nthe excavators carried the material to the Nile, and the Nile,\r\nreceiving it, would disperse it. In this way the lake is said to\r\nhave been excavated.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     STRABO, Book XVII. (B.C. 24).\r\n\r\nWriting of the Arsinoïte Nome he says, “This province is the\r\nmost remarkable of all in appearance, natural properties, and\r\nembellishment. It grows olive-trees which bear fruit. It produces wine\r\nin abundance, corn, pulse, and a great variety of other grains. . . .\r\n\r\n“It has also a remarkable lake called the Lake of Mœris, large\r\nenough to be called a sea, and resembling the open sea in colour;\r\nits shores are also similar in appearance to sea-beaches, whence\r\nwe may suspect a community of nature between them and the district\r\nabout Ammon. For they are in fact not far distant from one another\r\nor from Parætonium, and as there is good reason to suppose that the\r\nlatter temple formerly stood on the sea-shore, so also this district\r\nmust formerly have been littoral. Lower Egypt and the parts towards\r\nthe Serbonian Lake were then covered by the sea, perhaps connected\r\nwith the Red Sea by Heroöpolis and the Elanitic Gulf. . . .\r\n\r\n“Thus, the Lake of Mœris is, from its size and depth, capable of\r\nreceiving the overflow of the Nile at its rising, and preventing the\r\nflooding of houses and gardens; when the river falls, the lake again\r\ndischarges the water by a canal at both orifices, and it is available\r\nfor irrigation. There are regulators at both ends of the canal for\r\ncontrolling the inflow and outflow. Near these is an immense stone\r\nLabyrinth, a work comparable with the Pyramids; and the tomb of the\r\nking who constructed it. . . .\r\n\r\n“Sailing 100 furlongs further one comes to the city Arsinoë,\r\nformerly called Crocodilopolis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n         DIODORUS SICULUS, Book I. Chap. LI. (about B.C. 20).\r\n\r\n“He (King Mœris) dug a lake 600 furlongs above the city (Memphis), which\r\nis amazingly useful and incredibly large. Its circumference is said to\r\nbe 3600 furlongs, and its depth in most parts 50 fathoms. . . . For as\r\nthe rising of the Nile is irregular, and the fertility of the country\r\ndepends on its uniformity, he dug the lake for the reception of the\r\nsuperfluous water. And he constructed a canal from the river to the lake\r\n80 furlongs in length and 300 feet in breadth. Through this he admitted\r\nor let out water as required, the mouth being opened or closed by an\r\nelaborate and costly process (for it cost not less than 50 talents\r\nwhenever any one wished to open or close the mechanism). This lake has\r\ncontinued to serve the Egyptians for this purpose down to our own times,\r\nand is called the Lake of Mœris after its constructor. When the king dug\r\nit he left in the centre a place on which he built a tomb and two\r\npyramids, one for himself and the other for his wife, a furlong in\r\nheight, expecting thus to leave an immortal reputation for his\r\nbenefactions. The revenue of the fisheries in the lake he gave to his\r\nwife for her allowance for perfumes and cosmetics generally; they\r\nbrought in a sum of a talent of silver daily; for there are said to be\r\ntwenty-two kinds of fish in it, and the quantity taken is so large that\r\nthe numerous hands engaged in the salt-curing industry can hardly keep\r\npace with the work.”\r\n\r\n\r\n           PLINY, Nat. Hist., Book V. Chap. 9 (A.D. 50-70).\r\n\r\n“Between the nomes of Arsinoë and Memphis was a lake, 250 miles\r\n(i.e. Roman miles) in circumference; or, as Mucianus tells us,\r\n450 miles in circumference and 50 paces in depth, artificially\r\nconstructed, called the Lake of Mœris, from the king who made\r\nit. Seventy-two miles distant from this is Memphis, formerly the\r\ncapital of Egypt.”\r\n\r\n\r\n               PLINY, Nat. Hist., Book XXXVI. Chap. 16.\r\n\r\n“There were two other pyramids near the Lake of Mœris, which is\r\na large excavation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ARABIC TRADITION,\r\n\r\nas given by Mr. Cope Whitehouse in his article entitled “The\r\nExpansion of Egypt” in the _Contemporary Review_, September 1887,\r\ntranslated from an Arabic manuscript which once belonged to Cardinal\r\nMazarin:—\r\n\r\n“Joseph, to whom may Allah show mercy and grant peace, when he was\r\nPrime Minister of Egypt and high in favour with Raiyan, his sovereign,\r\nafter that he was more than a hundred years old, became an object of\r\nenvy to the favourites of the king and the puissant seigneurs of the\r\nCourt of Memphis, on account of the great power which he wielded and\r\nthe affection entertained for him by his monarch. They accordingly\r\nthus addressed the king: ‘Great king, Joseph is now very old;\r\nhis knowledge has diminished; his beauty has faded; his judgment\r\nis unsound; his sagacity has failed.’ The king said: ‘Set him\r\na task which shall serve as a test.’ At that time el-Fayoum was\r\ncalled el-Hun, or the Marsh. It served as a waste basin for the\r\nwaters of Upper Egypt, which flowed in and out unrestrained. The\r\ncourtiers having taken counsel together what to propose to the king,\r\ngave this reply to Pharaoh: ‘Lay the royal commands upon Joseph\r\nthat he shall divert the water of the Nile from el-Hun and drain\r\nit, so as to give you a new province and an additional source of\r\nrevenue.’ The king assented, and summoning Joseph to his presence,\r\nsaid: ‘You know how dearly I love my daughter, and you see that\r\nthe time has arrived in which I ought to carve out an estate for\r\nher out of the crown lands, and give her a separate establishment,\r\nof which she would be the mistress. I have, however, no territory\r\navailable for this purpose except the submerged land of el-Hun. It\r\nis in many respects favourably situated. It is a convenient distance\r\nfrom my capital. It is surrounded by desert. My daughter will thus be\r\nindependent and protected.’ ‘Quite true, great king,’ responded\r\nJoseph, ‘when would you wish it done? for accomplished it shall\r\nbe by the aid of Allah, the all-powerful.’ ‘The sooner, the\r\nbetter,’ said the king. Then Allah inspired Joseph with a plan. He\r\ndirected him to make three canals; one from Upper Egypt, a canal on\r\nthe east, and a canal on the west. Joseph collected workmen and dug\r\nthe canal of Menhi from Ashmunîn to el-Lahûn. Then he excavated the\r\ncanal of el-Fayoum, and the eastern canal, with another canal near it\r\ncalled Ben-Hamed to the west. In this way the water was drained from\r\nel-Hun; then he set an army of labourers at work. They cut down the\r\ntamarisks and bushes which grew there and carried them away. At the\r\nseason when the Nile begins to rise the marsh had been converted into\r\ngood cultivable land. The Nile rose; the water entered the mouth of\r\nthe Menhi canal and flowed down the Nile Valley to el-Lahûn; thence\r\nit turned towards el-Fayoum, and entered that canal in such volume\r\nthat it filled it, and converted the land into a region irrigated by\r\nthe Nile. King Raiyan thereupon came to see his new province with the\r\ncourtiers who had advised him to set Joseph this task. When they saw\r\nthe result they greatly marvelled at the skill and inventive genius\r\nof Joseph, and exclaimed: ‘We do not know which most to admire,\r\nthe draining of the marsh and the destruction of the noxious plants,\r\nor the conversion of its surface into fertile and well-watered\r\nfields.’ Then the King said to Joseph, ‘How long did it take\r\nyou to bring this district into the excellent state in which I find\r\nit?’ ‘Seventy days,’ responded Joseph. Then Pharaoh turned\r\nto his courtiers and said: ‘Apparently one could not have done\r\nit in a thousand days.’ Thus the name was changed from el-Hun,\r\nor the Marsh, to el-Fayoum, ‘the land of a thousand days.’”\r\n\r\nThis pun is not to be appreciated in the translation without a\r\nknowledge of Arabic. _Elf_ is the Arabic for a thousand, and _yôm_\r\nfor a day; _elf-yôm_ being a thousand days. As the work took seventy\r\ndays to complete, according to the tradition, it does not appear clear\r\nwhy it should have been called “the land of a thousand days”\r\ninstead of “the land of seventy days.” But the tradition must\r\nnot be criticised, as it will not stand it.\r\n\r\nThe name Fayûm is derived from an old Coptic word _phiûm_ signifying\r\na sea or lake; _el_ is simply the definite article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n             THEORIES AS TO WHERE AND WHAT LAKE MŒRIS WAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Postulates._—There seems to be a general agreement that Lake Mœris\r\nwas in the Fayûm, the evidence being conclusive. There is, further,\r\nno disposition shown to question the fact, that the Labyrinth and the\r\npyramid alongside it, were on the borders of Lake Mœris, and that\r\nthe present capital of the Fayûm, Medineh or Medinet-el-Fayûm,\r\noccupies part of the site of the ancient town of Crocodilopolis,\r\nor, as it was called afterwards, Arsinoë.\r\n\r\nThere seems also to be sufficient evidence for accepting the\r\nconclusion, that the site of the Labyrinth was at the foot of the\r\nHawârah pyramid.\r\n\r\nIt also seems to be agreed to accept the testimony of Herodotus,\r\nStrabo, and Diodorus, when they describe the uses which Lake Mœris\r\nserved, namely, to receive part of the Nile waters when the river\r\nwas in flood, and so to moderate its excesses, and also to return\r\nthe stored-up water to the Nile, when its discharge had fallen low\r\nin summer, and so to supplement its deficiencies.\r\n\r\n_Statements not accepted as postulates._—These same witnesses made\r\nother statements, which have been accepted or rejected according\r\nto the individual views of different theorists. If Herodotus and\r\nothers after him are rightly interpreted as stating that the Lake\r\nMœris was artificially dug out by human labour, I too must claim\r\nthe privilege of assuming that they were mistaken. As pointed\r\nout at the commencement of Chapter II. of this paper, Herodotus\r\nwas trying to give an account of what took place more than, at\r\nleast, 2000 years before, with no records to help him. Under such\r\ncircumstances, accuracy as to the origin of Lake Mœris was not to\r\nbe expected in his accounts. Being no engineer, and having a large\r\nbelief in the marvellous, he might well have supposed the whole\r\noasis artificially dug out. The absence of all signs of the earth\r\nresulting from this immense excavation puzzled him, and he asked what\r\nhad become of it. He was told that it had been carried to the Nile,\r\nwhose waters dispersed it, and this he _readily believed_, because\r\nhe had heard of a similar proceeding in another country, where some\r\nthieves excavated an underground passage to a king’s treasury,\r\nand got rid of the earth resulting from the excavation by throwing\r\nit into a river at the outer end of their shaft. This is comparing\r\nsmall and great with a vengeance. The distance of the centre of the\r\nLake Mœris excavation to the Nile would have been 50 kilometres\r\n(31 miles), and the quantity of earth to be carried and dispersed by\r\nthe Nile would have been at least 50,000 million cubic metres. Such\r\na task can scarcely be called similar to a simple mining operation.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian of to-day, if asked to account for any assumed fact,\r\nwill not pause to consider whether the assumed fact is really fact,\r\nbut will at once invent some more or less plausible explanation\r\nto account for it. I will give a remarkable instance of a very\r\ngenerally believed explanation of an annual Egyptian phenomenon,\r\nthough it has nothing to do with the Fayûm or Lake Mœris. In the\r\nsummer the land surface of the inundation basins of Upper Egypt is\r\nsplit up into mazes of deep cracks, into which innumerable rats\r\nare seen to disappear when disturbed. On the waters entering the\r\nbasins all this cracked area becomes submerged, and the question is,\r\nwhat becomes of the rats? Again, when the water is discharged from\r\nthe basins after remaining in them two months, the rats are found\r\n(or appear) to be in as great numbers as before. Again the question\r\nis, where have the rats come from? The accepted explanation is that\r\nwhen the water comes the rats turn into mud, and when it retires\r\nthe mud changes back again into rats. I could scarcely credit that\r\nso childish a belief was general, so I submitted the question to\r\na large Assembly of Notables (collected for a different purpose),\r\nand several members came forward and declared they had seen the\r\nrats in the state of semi-transition, when half mud and half rat,\r\nand offered to catch and deliver one to me. I accepted the offer,\r\nbut the matter has not yet gone any further.\r\n\r\nReturning to the discussion of the statement that Lake Mœris was\r\nartificially excavated, it strikes one as being a senseless operation\r\nto dig out a basin to the depth given as being that of the deepest\r\npart of Lake Mœris, viz. 92 metres, as all the water lying below half\r\nthe depth stated could have served no useful purpose, except from the\r\npoint of view of aquatic animals that have a liking for deep water.\r\n\r\nTheorists lay stress on some features testified to by the ancients,\r\nand explain away or discredit other points of their testimony\r\naccording as they support or are hostile to their adopted theories;\r\nor else they give strained interpretations to other statements from\r\nthe same motives. Such statements, for instance, as the following\r\nare subject to this varied treatment.\r\n\r\nHerodotus, and others after him, state that the circumference of\r\nLake Mœris was 720 kilometres (450 miles), or, as some interpret,\r\n360 kilometres, according to the value of the stadius adopted. Depth,\r\n92 metres.\r\n\r\nThe length of the lake lies north and south. It was artificially\r\nmade. There were two pyramids, crowned by colossal statues, centrally\r\nsituated in the lake, as viewed from the Labyrinth or Arsinoë.\r\n\r\nThe water in the lake was not derived from local sources, but\r\nwas brought in from the Nile by a canal. The lake was between the\r\nArsinoïte and Memphite nomes.\r\n\r\nCrocodilopolis was on or near the borders of the lake, and 9400\r\nmetres from the Labyrinth.\r\n\r\nLake Mœris formed an elbow to the west, was oblong, and situate in\r\nthe middle of the lands along the mountains above Memphis.\r\n\r\nThese statements are not in the original language in which they were\r\nmade, and may be inaccurately translated, where accurate rendering\r\nis important. I have found for instance in different publications\r\nthe two following translations of the same passage in Diodorus:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) “A little south of Memphis a canal was cut for a lake,\r\nbrought down in length from the city 40 miles.”\r\n\r\n(_b_) “And a little above the city he cut a dyke for a pond,\r\nbringing it down in length from the city 320 furlongs.” (Translation\r\nby G. Booth.)\r\n\r\nA canal and dyke are not synonymous terms, in all parts of England\r\nat any rate; nor are lake and pond.\r\n\r\nSome of the statements are founded also on hearsay when they were\r\nfirst made, and the ancestors of the present inhabitants of the\r\nFayûm may, for all that is known, have had as great a tendency to\r\nthe widest possible departure from scientific accuracy of statement\r\nin their verbal representation of facts, as it is notorious that\r\ntheir modern successors have. Hence it is not surprising that human\r\nnature, which has a parental prejudice in favour of any theory to\r\nwhich it may have given birth, should take advantage of these weak\r\npoints to the benefit of its offspring.\r\n\r\nWe will then proceed to discuss the present generation of theories,\r\nwhich exemplify this principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LINANT THEORY.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these theories is that of Linant de Bellefonds\r\nPasha, once Minister of Public Works in Egypt.\r\n\r\nHis views will be found in Chapter II. of his ‘Mémoires sur les\r\nPrincipaux Travaux d’utilité publique exécutés en Egypte depuis\r\nla plus haute antiquité jusqu’à nos jours, 1872-1873.’\r\n\r\nHis theory, which defines the form and limits of Lake Mœris,\r\nappears to have been generally accepted after being propounded,\r\nand still to be the accepted theory with many, who have not, by a\r\npersonal acquaintance with the Fayûm and its actual conformation and\r\nlevels, corrected the ideas which they had accepted on the authority\r\nof Linant Pasha.\r\n\r\n(For the names of places quoted from M. Linant’s writings I have\r\nadopted the more modern way of spelling, as otherwise the places might\r\nnot be recognised. For instance, had it not been for the context, I\r\nshould not have been able to recognise the village known as Abûksah\r\nin “Bogça.”)\r\n\r\n_Linant’s Theory stated._—M. Linant maintains that Lake Mœris\r\noccupied the gap in the hills by which the Bahr Yûsuf enters the\r\nFayûm, and covered the so-called “plateau” on the south-east\r\nof Medineh, the encircling bank commencing at its north-east\r\nend at Edwah, and being continued through el-Alam, Biahmu,\r\nZowyet-el-Karatsah, to Medineh. See Plate VII.\r\n\r\nThe remains of this bank he traced throughout this length, and saw\r\nevidences of it again to the S.S.E. of Medineh.\r\n\r\nThence he _supposed_ that it must have passed on to Abgig (“je\r\nsuppose qu’elle a dû passer à Ebgig”), el Sawafnah, Atamnah,\r\nand Gaafrah. Then he found it again constructed in masonry over a\r\ngreat length not far from the village of Miniet-el-Hêt. It continues\r\nafterwards (according to Linant Pasha) up to Shêkh Abu Nûr, and then\r\ntakes the direction of “el Gharak in the plain,” where it is no\r\nlonger well defined (“où elle n’est plus bien marquée”). He\r\nnotes that at Bahr Nezlah its height (that is, the wall’s,) is\r\n12 metres.[2] He then makes the bank pass on from the south-east\r\nof Sélé (?) to between Shêkh Danial and Tutûn, in an easterly\r\ndirection, and turn to the north by Kalamshah, El Nedlé (?), to\r\nthe Bahr Yûsuf, then following the Bahr Yûsuf up to Dimishkîn,\r\nturning along the banks at Lahûn (Bahlawân and Gedallah), it again\r\nreturns to the west near Hawârat-el-Maqta, and, following the old\r\ncanal Wardan, passes the Hawârah pyramid at the village of Dimu\r\nand joins the commencement of the bank at the south-east of Sêlah\r\n(Sélé).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.\r\n\r\nMAP SHOWING LINANT’S SUPPOSED LAKE MŒRIS.\r\n\r\nFrom Rawlinson’s ‘Egypt,’ 1881.]\r\n\r\nAll the land enclosed by this bank represents the site of Lake Mœris\r\naccording to the theory of Linant de Bellefonds Pasha.\r\n\r\nI give here a map, Plate VII., copied from one of Mr. Cope\r\nWhitehouse’s papers on the Wadi Raiân, being a reproduction from\r\nthe ‘Egypt’ of Canon Rawlinson, as it is a convenient one for\r\ndemonstrating what this theory is. Linant’s Lake Mœris is shown\r\non this map as a dark patch occupying what M. Linant calls the high\r\nplateau. The part where “LAKE” is printed is actually the highest\r\npart of the Fayûm, at R.L. 22 to 25, if we except the narrow pass\r\nby which the Bahr Yûsuf flows in. This latter has its land surface\r\nat from R.L. 24 to 26. But the word “MŒRIS” on the shaded area\r\nlies over a depression whose bed is at R.L. 12·00, that is, 11 to\r\n12 metres lower than the land surface covered by the word “LAKE”\r\non the same shaded area.\r\n\r\nThe north boundary of this area through el Edwah and el Alam runs\r\ngenerally along contour R.L. 17·50, 5 to 7 metres below the high\r\nplateau. It is therefore incorrect to speak of the ground represented\r\nby the shaded area as a plateau.\r\n\r\nM. Linant’s depth of water in his supposed lake was fixed at\r\n9·60 metres. Its bed must have been at R.L. 21·00, the level\r\nof the rock-bed at Hawârah, and its maximum water surface at\r\nR.L. 30·60. The height of the surrounding bank would have had to\r\nbe, on the Edwah-el-Alam line, 15 metres, and at the Wadi Nezlah\r\n(at the initial letter of “MŒRIS” on the map) 20 metres.\r\n\r\nNow the country lying between the Linant Lake Mœris and the\r\nBirket-el-Qurûn was said to be irrigated from this lake. Imagine\r\nthe state of insecurity for this tract of sloping land, with a huge\r\nreservoir of water standing 13 metres above that part which lies along\r\nthe north face of the lake, and more than this above the part along\r\nthe west face. When one considers, too, that there must have been\r\npassages for irrigation through this bank, and how dangerous such an\r\narrangement would be, it is scarcely credible that the collection of\r\nthriving towns included in the Arsinoïte nome would have grown in\r\nsuch a perilous situation. Imagine, also, the infiltration that would\r\nresult on the lands along the faces of this lake. According to the\r\ntheory, the Lake Linant, not being of sufficient dimensions itself to\r\nregulate the Nile, was to pass on the surplus into Birket-el-Qurûn\r\nby escapes on the two main drainage lines. Thus the poor fools, who\r\nhad settled themselves on the strip between the two lakes, would be\r\nin danger of inundation, both from above and below, and would be in\r\nas bad a plight as Pharaoh’s horsemen in the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nA diagrammatic section of the Fayûm (Plate VIII.), as it would have\r\nbeen when in this unhappy state (fortunately imaginary), will make the\r\nsituation perhaps plainer. The diagram, by exaggerating the vertical\r\ndimensions with reference to the horizontals, emphasises the danger\r\nof the situation and shows how improbable it is that such a theory\r\ncould be true.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF THE FAYÛM\r\n\r\nFrom Lahûn through Biahmu to Lake Qurûn through the highest plateau,\r\nshowing Linant’s supposed Lake.]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the Linant Lake itself covers the richest\r\nland of the Fayûm, namely, that which, being near the first point of\r\nexpansion of the inflow into the depression, had received the richest\r\ndeposit during the time that the Fayûm was forming previous to the\r\ncreation of Lake Mœris; and, further, it should be remarked that the\r\nremainder of the best land round the margins and for a considerable\r\ndistance from the Linant lake banks would have been probably ruined\r\nby infiltration. Where, then, should we find the rich lands of the\r\nArsinoïte Nome, so famous for their produce?\r\n\r\nM. Linant objects (and there is, doubtless, weight in this objection)\r\nto the theory of the submergence of the Fayûm by a sufficient\r\nelevation of the waters of the Birket-el-Qurûn, that there would be\r\nno place for the Arsinoïte Nome; and he thinks that by his theory\r\nhe has found a place for it between the two rival lakes. The ancient\r\nEgyptians, who lived before our era, must have had prodigious faith\r\nin their protecting deities, or in their department of public works,\r\nif they took up their abode behind Linant’s bank.\r\n\r\nSuch a peculiar arrangement of land and water as that supposed,\r\nwould scarcely have been passed without notice by those who visited\r\nand described Lake Mœris. The Arsinoïte Nome would have been in\r\nsome way described as being between two lakes, with a mass of water\r\nimpending over it. The danger of such an arrangement in case of\r\na breach would have been surely noted. Imagine also the condition\r\nof Arsinoë from its sanitary aspect in the hot months of summer,\r\nwhen by reason of all the water in the Linant lake being utilised,\r\nthe bed of the lake would be laid bare at a time when no crops could\r\nbe sown on it. But this objection may be met by supposing the lake\r\nto have been excavated to a sufficient depth for water to remain\r\nin it at lowest Nile. But if originally so excavated, a lake such\r\nas this was supposed to be, would rapidly silt up, and M. Linant\r\nsupposes it silted up 8 metres, as is shown by his section and\r\ndescription. Could such a lake have continued in working order for\r\nover 2000 years, as it was supposed to have done? It would only have\r\ndone so by means of periodical silt clearances of such magnitude,\r\nthat the population of Egypt alone would not have been equal to\r\nthe task. Suppose only a metre to be cleared over the whole area\r\n(assuming it a plateau according to M. Linant’s view of it), the\r\nquantity to be cleared would have been 250 million cubic metres, which\r\nwould have to have been removed to a mean distance of at least 2000\r\nmetres! What would have happened to Linant’s supposed Arsinoïte\r\nNome, and the west bank of the Nile irrigated by his Lake Mœris,\r\nwhile these clearances were going on?\r\n\r\nThe perimeter of Linant’s supposed lake is 96 kilometres (60 miles)\r\nmeasured on the map published in the atlas accompanying the book\r\ncontaining M. Linant’s theory. Its _correct_ area is 257,800,000\r\nsquare metres. But M. Linant himself gives the area as 405,479,000\r\nsquare metres, which is 57 per cent. in excess of the true area as\r\ntaken from his own map (see diagram, Plate IX). The paragraph in\r\nwhich this figure is given concludes: “Mais nous avons vu quelle\r\nfoi on devait avoir dans les dimensions données par les auteurs\r\nanciens.” Need he have added “anciens”? M. Linant himself is\r\nthe greatest argument for placing no faith in reported dimensions of\r\nlake areas, since, with his own map before him, and the limits of his\r\nlake definitely determined, he was unable to avoid so large an error.\r\n\r\nThe author of this theory states that it satisfies all the conditions\r\nrequired for its recognition as Lake Mœris. I think it will be\r\nfound to satisfy very few, and obviously not the two following,\r\nregarding its size and depth.\r\n\r\nIt is generally stated that Herodotus gave the circuit of Lake Mœris\r\nas 450 miles, or 720 kilometres. The perimeter of M. Linant’s\r\nlake is about 110 kilometres, but he makes the difference less by\r\nadopting M. Jomard’s opinion, that Herodotus’ “stade” was\r\n“le petit stade,” whereby the circuit of the lake, according to\r\nHerodotus, would be 360 kilometres. Even thus we can scarcely admit\r\nthis condition to be satisfied. But M. Linant, as we have seen,\r\nhas no faith in the dimensions given by “les auteurs anciens,”\r\nbut though his want of faith may be justified, his statement that\r\nthis condition is satisfied is not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF THE LINANT “LAKE MŒRIS.”\r\n\r\nTaken from Linant’s own Map.]\r\n\r\nAnother condition which M. Linant’s lake is far from satisfying, is\r\nthe depth, which Herodotus gives as 92 metres. Linant makes his lake\r\ndepth 9·60 metres, assuming that his lake area occupies a plateau,\r\nwhich it does not. The greatest depth of his lake, according to the\r\nactual levels of the ground included in it, would be 18·60 metres,\r\nagainst the 92 metres of Herodotus. This condition therefore is\r\nnot satisfied.\r\n\r\n_Faulty Foundations on which the Linant Theory was built._—Had\r\nLinant Pasha had before him a contoured map of the Fayûm, I believe\r\nhe would never have enunciated his theory. The Minia wall made\r\nan undue impression on him and has been his stumbling-block. He\r\nclearly traced the remains of a large bank from Edwah to Biahmu,\r\nand less plainly to Medineh, but after Medineh he found _no traces_\r\nof a bank, but being desirous of connecting up with the big wall,\r\n_supposed that it must have_ passed through certain villages leading\r\nto it. This wall, closing a valley encircled by contour R.L. 15·00,\r\nwas probably constructed at a much later date, or at any rate\r\nindependently of the bank of which the remains are found on the other\r\nside of Medineh, and for a different purpose. If this wall had been\r\noriginally higher there would be remains of the high parts at each\r\nend, where breaches had not carried away the original wall. This we\r\ndo not find, but on the contrary, the crest of the wall is at one\r\nuniform level from end to end, and appears to have been added to,\r\ninstead of taken from. From an examination of the abutments of the\r\nbridge, built in the line of the wall, the original wall appears to\r\nhave been constructed of stone, and to have been widened subsequently\r\nby an addition of coarse brick masonry of rough bricks, in mortar\r\nmade of lime and clay, probably with the view of obtaining width\r\nenough to carry an aqueduct along the top of the wall. None of the\r\nmasonry is sufficiently good for this purpose, and so, no doubt,\r\nthe water, leaking from the aqueduct channel, gave rise to breaches\r\nin the wall, of which the signs are evident in the blocks of masonry\r\nlying scattered about on its down-stream side.\r\n\r\nThe cross-section of the wall, Plate X., gives its dimensions at\r\na point near the bridge, where its height is greatest. Below this\r\ncross-section another of the Edwah-Biahmu bank is given for a\r\ncomparison of the levels of wall and bank.[3]\r\n\r\n_Erroneous Data employed by Linant._—In Linant Pasha’s Atlas,\r\npublished with his Mémoires, is to be found an extraordinary section\r\nof the Fayûm from Lahûn to Birket-el-Qurûn, in which the land\r\nfrom Lahûn to Medineh is shown as being higher than the land of\r\nBeni Suef on the Nile Valley side of Lahûn.\r\n\r\nI reproduce his section on Plate XI., and below it I give a section\r\nshowing the actual levels. As Linant appears to refer all his levels\r\nto the rock bed at Hawârat-el-Maqta, which he makes 32·80 metres\r\nabove sea, whereas it is really 21·00, it is necessary before\r\ncomparison to apply a correction of - 11·80 to all his levels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.\r\n\r\nCROSS SECTION OF THE MINIA WALL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS SECTION OF THE EDWAH-BIAHMU BANK AT A POINT\r\nWEST OF EDWAH.]\r\n\r\nComparing the figures after correction with those of the “actual\r\nsection,” it will be found that Linant puts the level of the\r\nBeni Suef lands 5½ to 7 metres too low, and that of his first\r\nplateau 6 to 8 metres too high, with reference to the rock bed\r\nat Hawârat-el-Maqta. According to the corrected figures his Lake\r\nMœris level would be + 32·00, but how he gets it to that level\r\nit is difficult to understand, inasmuch as he says that his lake is\r\nfilled by the Bahr Yûsuf, whose high-water level is shown 4½ metres\r\nlower. (The Birket-el-Qurûn level, after applying the correction,\r\nbecomes 40·80, which must have been about its correct level in\r\nLinant’s time.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\nSECTION OF THE FAYÛM THROUGH LAHÛN-MEDINEH-SANHUR. By M. LINANT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACTUAL SECTION ON THE SAME LINE.\r\n\r\n_Note._—The water-level of the Bahr Yûsuf from Lahûn to Medineh\r\nis a little below country level throughout.]\r\n\r\nI give another instance of error with reference to Linant’s\r\nconception of the first plateau. Writing of the bank from Edwah to el\r\nAlam, he states that the land to the south of this bank was about 2\r\nmetres below its crest, and to the north of it from 8 to 9 metres,\r\nwhich difference, he says, is explained by the deposition of silt\r\nin the interior of the basin formed by the bank, as is always seen\r\nelsewhere at all the banks of the inundation basins of Egypt. This\r\ngreat difference of level of the country surface on either side of\r\nthe bank would have been very suggestive in a sense favourable to\r\nM. Linant’s theory had the difference of level been a fact instead\r\nof a fiction. The cross-section of the bank given on Plate X. shows\r\nits actual state with reference to the land on each side of it.\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely necessary to discuss further a theory that was\r\nbased on such erroneous data, but as the data were not known\r\nto be erroneous, and Linant propounded his theory with an air\r\nof authority, it has had considerable success in getting itself\r\naccepted. Guide-books, and even books used as school text-books on\r\nEgyptian history, show that his theory has been hitherto judged the\r\ncorrect one.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, satisfactory to find that in the fifth edition\r\n(1890) of ‘Ancient Egypt’ by George Rawlinson (The Story of\r\nthe Nations Series) the exact size and position of “Amenemhat’s\r\nreservoir” is admitted to be _sub judice_, and it would appear that\r\nthis desirable attitude is the result of a challenge of Linant’s\r\ntheory by Mr. Cope Whitehouse, who is reported as believing that\r\nthe water was freely admitted into the whole of the depression\r\n(i.e. the Fayûm), which it filled, with the exception of certain\r\nparts, which stood up out of the water as islands from 150 to 200 feet\r\nhigh. Nevertheless, in spite of this new attitude towards the Linant\r\ntheory, the map representing Linant’s Lake Mœris is to be found\r\nat the end of the book, without any remark to prevent readers from\r\nbeing misled by it, the map being described as “Map of the Fayoum,\r\nshowing the Birket-el-Keroun and the artificial Lake Mœris.”\r\n(Plate VII. is from an earlier edition.)\r\n\r\nThe Linant theory, examined in the light of the more accurate\r\nknowledge gained of the physical features of the Fayûm, and tested\r\nby the application of figures to determine its possible performances,\r\ncan no longer stand, but falls to pieces; and the wonder is that,\r\nbased as it was upon erroneous data and propped up by no solid\r\nsupport of facts, it stood so long. It may be said of it, to the\r\ncredit of its author, that it was ingenious, but not that it was true.\r\n\r\nSince writing the foregoing concerning the Linant theory, Mr. Cope\r\nWhitehouse has kindly lent me his first papers on the subject, the\r\nearliest paper, that I had previously seen of his writings, being\r\nthat which was read by him at the Manchester meeting of the British\r\nAssociation, September 2nd, 1887. I now find that he has been before\r\nme in stating many of the arguments I have used against the Linant\r\nlake theory, but it is satisfactory to find that we have independently\r\narrived at the same conclusions, though by no means surprising, as I\r\nbelieve that any one, with the same amount of personal acquaintance\r\nwith the Fayûm, would be naturally led to hold the same views of this\r\nfantastic theory. As early as 1882, Mr. Cope Whitehouse pointed out\r\nthat the Linant lake satisfied none of the conditions which a lake\r\nprofessing to be Lake Mœris must satisfy, and he concluded one of\r\nhis papers with a remark expressing his conviction that, when Lake\r\nMœris shall be recognised by the light of discoveries yet to be made\r\nthrough further research, the site of the ancient lake will in no case\r\nbe found to be that of the reservoir of M. Linant de Bellefonds Pasha.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitehouse, at the same time as he lent me his papers of 1882,\r\nalso lent me a copy of Dr. G. Schweinfurth’s letter to Paul\r\nAscherson on a journey undertaken in the depression of the Fayûm\r\nin January 1886, in which letter I find I am anticipated again in\r\na footnote on this theory, which gives an argument not given by\r\nMr. Cope Whitehouse, and runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Here it must be mentioned that one of the most important points\r\non which Linant grounds his Mœris theory is the Dams[4] which has\r\nproved quite fallacious. The dam at Adwa (Edwah) geology shows to\r\nbe layers of gravel; the stone dam at Minia is, on the other hand,\r\na weir for the Bahr-el-Wady, and is evidently throughout its whole\r\nlength of later date. Besides, it fills up only the deep curves of\r\nthe ground, and has no continuation on the rising grounds.”\r\n\r\nDr. Schweinfurth, as well as Mr. Whitehouse, had thus pointed out\r\nthe weakness of the Linant theory, but still we find it living and\r\n_taught_ as a true theory so late as 1890; and this is my excuse for\r\nrepeating the arguments which have not yet succeeded in overwhelming\r\nit, notwithstanding its feebleness, so much support does it derive\r\nfrom its parent being a reputed authority.\r\n\r\nBut we have public acceptance of the Linant theory so late as 1892,\r\nand by so eminent an Egyptologist as Brugsch Pasha, who communicated\r\nhis views to the Société Khédiviale de Géographie in a paper\r\nread in Cairo, on the 8th April, 1892, the title of the paper being\r\n“Le Lac Mœris d’après les monuments.” A quotation from this\r\nwill show that he accepts the Linant theory.\r\n\r\n“De nos jours, les traces visibles de cet immense bassin d’eau\r\n(le lac Mœris) ont disparu et les savants les plus distingués se\r\nsont en vain efforcés pendant longtemps de retrouver ses anciennes\r\nlimites sur le sol moderne de la province du Fayoum.\r\n\r\n“L’opinion la plus généralement acceptée au sujet de sa position a\r\nLinant pacha pour auteur. C’est lui qui, le premier, a rejeté l’idée de\r\nreconnaître le bassin du lac Mœris dans le Birket-el-Kouroun de nos\r\njours, c’est-à-dire ‘le lac des Cornes,’ situé comme on sait, à l’ouest\r\ndu Fayoum. Suivant les recherches très minutieuses de l’illustre savant,\r\nil faudrait, au contraire, se diriger vers le côté oriental de la\r\nprovince susnommée, et, notamment, vers les plateaux bien connus de\r\nHawara et de El Lahoun, où deux pyramides construites à l’époque de\r\nla XIIme dynastie (vers 2500 a. J.C.) excitent encore la curiosité\r\ndes voyageurs.\r\n\r\n“H. Lepsius, mon savant compatriote qui, il y a presque cinquante\r\nans, a eu l’occasion d’examiner sur les lieux les résultats\r\nobtenus par Linant pacha, n’a pas hésité à déclarer dans un\r\nMémoire spécial que le savant français avait fait la découverte la\r\nplus brillante et la plus indubitable quant à la véritable position\r\ntopographique du fameux lac Mœris. Les doutes qu’il exprima à\r\nla même occasion ne s’appliquaient qu’à l’extension du lac\r\nvers le nord.\r\n\r\n“Depuis Linant et Lepsius, aucun savant sérieux, du nombre des\r\ngéographes et des Égyptologues, ne s’est opposé à l’opinion\r\némise par ces deux illustres auteurs.”\r\n\r\nApparently Brugsch Pasha does not class Dr. G. Schweinfurth, Mr.\r\nFlinders Petrie, and Mr. Cope Whitehouse as “savants sérieux,” for they\r\nhave expressed themselves as opposed to the Linant theory.\r\nLieut.-Colonel J. C. Ross, C.M.G., late Inspector-General of Irrigation,\r\nEgypt, justly renowned for his power of comprehension of the levels of\r\nany part of the country, which he studied professionally, at one time\r\ngave much of his attention to the Fayûm, and especially to that part\r\nwhich was known as Hod-el-Tuyûr, and which is the depression embraced in\r\nthe area which Linant calls a plateau and in which he localised his\r\nsupposed Lake Mœris. I think I may say, without fear of contradiction,\r\nthat Colonel Ross’s examination of the ground in question was much more\r\nthorough and more prolonged than that of M. Lepsius; but whereas the\r\nlatter did not hesitate to accept Linant’s theory and to style it the\r\nmost brilliant and certain discovery as regards the position of Lake\r\nMœris, Colonel Ross on the contrary rejects Linant’s theory and\r\nthinks that the lake was north of the Edwah bank and not south of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Petrie has also clearly expressed the same views as Colonel Ross\r\non this point.\r\n\r\nI too have had advantages of studying the ground itself and the way\r\nthe water runs, such as few have had, and have come in for the legacy\r\nof Colonel Ross’s levellings and maps.\r\n\r\nThe names of Linant and Lepsius do not therefore carry with them\r\nsufficient authority to override the facts, which are ascertained to\r\nbe such by a more thorough examination of the country and a better\r\nknowledge of the physical features of the province.\r\n\r\nIrrigation officers may, perhaps, not be classed as “savants,”\r\nbut they have at least as much right to be heard as any other body of\r\nexperts on such a subject as Lake Mœris, which is more than anything\r\nelse an irrigation question, and one that has especial interest of\r\na more or less practical nature at this time, when the question of\r\nthe construction of Nile reservoirs for the storage of the surplus\r\nwaters of the Nile is under consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COPE WHITEHOUSE THEORY.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope Whitehouse, who has a personal acquaintance with the\r\nFayûm, and has studied the question of Lake Mœris, though with\r\na prejudice in favour of giving the Wadi Raiân a leading part,\r\nwould possibly have been inclined to hold the same views as I do,\r\nhad it not been for his anxiety to recommend the Wadi Raiân for\r\nfuture use by magnifying its imaginary past performances. But as\r\nhis views about the Wadi Raiân are the essential and distinctive\r\npart of his theory, we do not agree.\r\n\r\nFor ten years Mr. Whitehouse has been brooding, as the faithfullest\r\nof mothers, over his theory, looking for a practical project to be\r\nhatched therefrom, but, as time passes, he begins to show signs of\r\nimpatience, and fears lest his egg be addled. The possibilities as\r\nto what the chick may be when it appears, are set forth in Chapter\r\nV. of this paper, for I cannot but think that the egg is a good one.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitehouse believes that in prehistoric times, before artificial\r\nworks of control were made, the Nile flowed into and submerged the\r\nwhole Fayûm, which was filled at high Nile, and that when the flood\r\nsubsided, the return flow, that took place from the Fayûm to the\r\nNile, prolonged the period of inundation by at least two months. He\r\nalso believes that the river flowed in a single channel along the\r\neastern desert.\r\n\r\nSo far most of us who have our theories about the Fayûm travel\r\ntogether, with but small differences on the way. But after this our\r\nroads diverge, and each thinks the road he has selected leads to\r\nLake Mœris. But they cannot all go there.\r\n\r\nLeaving prehistoric times, and coming to the period of ancient\r\nhistory, Mr. Whitehouse holds that there were two lakes. At first the\r\nnorthern lake, the Fayûm, was a lake and marsh serving as a backwater\r\nto the Nile, while the southern, the Wadi Raiân, was dry. So far I\r\nagree with him, but now we part company. Subsequently, he imagines,\r\nengineers of an alien race diverted the flood waters into the dry\r\nWadi Raiân to the south-west and evaporation dried up the Fayûm,\r\nwhich was then irrigated by a system of canals. The Wadi Raiân\r\nbasin becoming, full served as a reservoir, and was, according to\r\nMr. Whitehouse, the “Mœridis Lacus” of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nLater on, in 1890, Mr. Whitehouse explains his views in terms which\r\nare not quite in agreement with the foregoing, for he then supposes\r\nthat the natural backwater of the Nile included the Fayûm and Wadi\r\nRaiân (with its minor basins Wadis “Safir” and “Lulu”) at\r\none and the same time, and that these combined basins were filled\r\nto the level of high Nile, which he puts at R.L. 30·00.\r\n\r\nI think, however, his present views are, that at first the Wadi\r\nRaiân formed part of the Lake Mœris of Herodotus, of which the\r\nFayûm was the main part; and that afterwards the Wadi Raiân alone\r\nformed the “Mœridis Lacus” of the Ptolemaic maps, the Fayûm\r\nhaving been brought under cultivation, after its waters had been\r\ndried up by evaporation.\r\n\r\nAs the Wadi Raiân is the prominent feature of this theory, I will\r\ngive here in full Colonel Western’s official description of it:—\r\n\r\n_Description of the Wadi Raiân._—“This valley or depression in\r\nthe Libyan Desert, discovered by Mr. Cope Whitehouse in 1886 (really\r\nthree or four years earlier), lies immediately to the south-west of\r\nthe Fayoum Province, but separated from it by a range of low hills,\r\n2 kilometres in width and with heights of about 40 metres above\r\nsea-level. Two passes, however, leading from the Gharak basin, with\r\nlevel of + 26 metres, have been found in this dividing range and,\r\nexcept for these two passes or entrances, the Wadi is everywhere\r\nbounded by hills of at least + 36 metres.\r\n\r\n“The soil of the Wadi is for the most part composed of desert sand\r\nand pebbles overlying in places a yellow clay, but this desert sand\r\nis for about one-sixth of the area hidden by drifting sand-hills or\r\nridges rising some 5 to 10 metres above the general plain.\r\n\r\n“Towards the south of the Wadi there are two fresh-water springs;\r\nand near these a few date-trees and some brushwood grow.\r\n\r\n“The deepest level of the Wadi Raian reaches 40 metres below\r\nsea-level.\r\n\r\n“To the east of the Wadi, and connected at a level of + 55, is\r\nthe Wadi Muellah, a valley about 1½ kilometres wide and 7 long. Its\r\nlowest depression is at + 25.\r\n\r\n“In the Wadi Muellah there are ruins of ancient buildings, and a\r\nfair amount of coarse vegetation near them.\r\n\r\n“Another small depression, also connected with the Wadi Raian,\r\nhas been found lying to the south of the Gharak basin of the Fayoum,\r\nand only separated by a ridge at level + 35, and 1 kilometre in\r\nwidth. This depression is some 10 kilometres in length by 4 mean\r\nwidth, and has a bottom at about + 15 metres.”\r\n\r\nNow, there is no evidence whatever that the Wadi Raiân had ever\r\nany possible communication with the Nile except by way of the\r\nFayûm depression through the two gaps in the encircling walls of\r\nthe Wadi, the sills of which are stated by Colonel Western to be at\r\nR.L. 26·00, but which later surveys, not yet published, show to be\r\none at R.L. 26·00, and the other at R.L. 27·00. The Wadi Muellah,\r\non first inspection of the map, appears to offer the most likely\r\nline of communication with the Nile Valley, but an examination of\r\nthis Wadi at its upper end towards the Nile Valley gives no evidence\r\nof any such communication having ever existed.\r\n\r\nWhat seems a conclusive proof that the Wadi Raiân was never in\r\n_direct_ communication with the Nile Valley, is the total absence\r\nof all trace of Nile deposit within the limits of the depression.\r\n\r\nIf the muddy waters of the Nile in flood entered a lake 60 to 70\r\nmetres deep, the silt would be deposited and remain, for the return\r\nflow from the uppermost stratum back into the Nile would disturb none\r\nof the Nile mud brought in. After a long succession of such annual\r\ndeposits, the depth of deposit would be considerable. In the Fayûm\r\nentrance we find such a deposit up to R.L. 25·00, and it is to be\r\nnoted that the Wadi Raiân was supposed by Mr. Cope Whitehouse to\r\nhave been in working order, as Lake Mœris, after the Fayûm ceased\r\nto be so, and therefore there would have been less time for the\r\ndisappearance of the Nile deposit of the Wadi Raiân than of that\r\nof the Fayûm.\r\n\r\nIn the Wadi Raiân, Nile deposit has _not_ been found, though eagerly\r\nlooked for. I think this fact is fatal to Mr. Cope Whitehouse’s\r\ntheory of a _direct_ communication between the Wadi Raiân and the\r\nNile or Bahr Yûsuf.\r\n\r\nDr. Schweinfurth thus expresses his views as regards fresh-water\r\ndeposit in the Wadi Raiân:—“The basin (Wadi Raiân) exists,\r\nbut it comes from geological time, does not belong to the Nile,\r\nand offers nowhere in its tracts at some distance from the Fayûm\r\nany trace of a fresh-water formation. . . .\r\n\r\n“The traces of a settlement of water and layers of Nile earth which\r\nare said to exist in some parts of the depression are certainly\r\nabsent. The grey clay-layers of the old sea with shells of fresh\r\nwater, innumerable fish vertebras, bones of tortoises, &c., are not\r\nto be overlooked where they exist. I could prove such fresh-water\r\nformations on the road from Talît over Raiân and Medinet-el-Bahrl\r\n(27 kilometres to the west of the actual lake) only at a distance\r\nof 8 kilometres from the lake (Birket-el-Qurûn). The yellow Eocene\r\nmarls with stripes of erosion, results of the wind, moving sand,\r\nand of periodical rains, are not to be confounded with these lake\r\nformations. A man who does that will find traces of old water and\r\nNile earth everywhere in the deserts of Egypt.”\r\n\r\nLater on in the same letter he says that the question, whether\r\nfresh-water formations exist in the basin of Raiân or not, is to\r\nbe answered in the negative.\r\n\r\nBut supposing an _indirect_ communication with the Nile by way of the\r\nFayûm Lake, it is easy to understand that no Nile deposit would be\r\nfound in the Wadi Raiân, even if it had been thus repeatedly filled,\r\nbecause the top water only would begin to spill over into it after the\r\nFayûm Lake level had risen above R.L. 26·00, and after the water\r\nhad travelled at an extremely low velocity to a long distance from\r\nthe point, at which it first spread itself out in the Fayûm Basin.\r\n\r\nBut I regret, for the sake of Mr. Cope Whitehouse’s feelings,\r\nthat even this cannot be admitted to have taken place, for in\r\nevery situation where Nile water has been, fresh-water shells of\r\ndistinct species are always found, and their total absence in the\r\nWadi Raiân is sufficient proof to geologists that Nile water has\r\nnever been there.\r\n\r\nTo the conclusion that the Wadi Raiân was never in _direct_\r\ncommunication with the Nile must therefore be added this further\r\nconclusion, that the Nile water _never_ entered the Wadi Raiân _at\r\nall_, even by the only possible entrances over the sills on the side\r\nof the Fayûm Lake.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope Whitehouse has not distinctly stated how he supposes the\r\nWadi Raiân was put into direct communication with the Nile, but I\r\nbelieve there are only three possible theories, each one without a\r\nparticle of evidence to support it. One theory supposes a connection\r\nalong the bed of the Wadi Muellah, another a tunnel through the\r\nhills dividing the depression from the Nile Valley, and the third\r\na hill-side canal fed from the Nile waters entering at Lahûn and\r\ncarried along the south slopes of the Fayûm.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any evidence witnessing to the previous existence\r\nof such connections, and in the face of the fact that the Wadi Raiân\r\ncontains no Nile deposit, I do not think that Cope Whitehouse’s\r\nRaiân-Mœris or Ptolemaic-Mœridis-Lacus theory can stand.\r\n\r\nFailing better support to his theory, Mr. Whitehouse has called\r\nthe Ptolemaic maps to his aid, and in his pamphlet on the subject\r\nhe has reproduced the map of Egypt from the Atlas of Cl. Ptolemy,\r\nof which I here repeat the copy, with an outline map of the Fayûm,\r\nWadi Raiân, and part of the Nile Valley, taken from ‘Egyptian\r\nIrrigation,’ by Willcocks, and which was compiled from the latest\r\nsurveys in 1888 (Plates XII. and XIII.)\r\n\r\nMr. Whitehouse considers that the Ptolemaic map has been most\r\naccurate in giving the exact shape of a lake in the desert, whereas\r\nthe representation of the features of the much better known Nile\r\nand Nile Valley is evidently most incorrect, and much distorted in\r\nlongitudinal and transverse dimensions.\r\n\r\nIf, however, any argument can be based on the shape of the “Mœridis\r\nLacus” of Ptolemy, as compared with existing depressions, it seems\r\nto me that its shape resembles much more closely the outline of the\r\nFayûm Province, with the Bahr Yûsuf indicated, than it does that\r\nof the much indented Wadi Raiân.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.\r\n\r\nEGYPT FROM THE ATLAS OF Cl. Ptolemy.]\r\n\r\nMr. Petrie has furnished me with the following observations on the\r\nPtolemaic maps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\n_Stanford’s Geogl. Estabt. London_\r\n\r\nPROPOSED WADI RAIÂN RESERVOIR.\r\n\r\nFrom Willcocks’ ‘Egyptian Irrigation,’ 1889.]\r\n\r\nThe Ptolemaic maps are built up from itineraries and ship routes,\r\nchecked by a few latitudes. Now we know this much from Ptolemy, that\r\nSkiathis, Bakkhis, Dionysias, the Small Oasis and the Great Oasis\r\nwere on one route, and that on this route Lake Mœris was passed. This\r\nwas the desert itinerary from Alexandria to the Great Oasis.\r\n\r\nUsing another distinct itinerary from the Nile Valley, the route\r\npasses to Arsinoë (the modern Medinet-el-Fayûm) and Ptolemais\r\n(the modern Talît), and then on to Behnesa, without any connection\r\nbeing made with the Bakkhis-Dionysias route. Hence it is presumed\r\nthat these two routes did not cross each other. It is therefore\r\nconcluded that Dionysias can be identified neither with the ruins on\r\nthe Wadi Muellah (as Cope Whitehouse identifies it), nor with Lahûn,\r\nand that it was probably on the west of Lake Mœris. Mr. Petrie\r\n(to whom I am indebted for the whole of this reasoning) supposes\r\nBakkhis to have been at Dimeh (Dimay), and Dionysias somewhere at\r\nthe extreme south-west of the Raiân valley.\r\n\r\nIf this conclusion is right, and if the Fayûm, or the Wadi Raiân,\r\nwas the Lake Mœris of Ptolemy, the Lake has been placed too much\r\nto the west on the map, and should have been shown on the east of\r\nthe line joining Bakkhis and Dionysias. In any case the Ptolemaic\r\nevidence, when sifted, does not support Cope Whitehouse’s theory,\r\nthat the Wadi Raiân was the “Mœridis Lacus” of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nTo show what little faith can be put in the identification of\r\nsome of the ancient towns with modern remains, I may mention that\r\nDr. Schweinfurth says of the monastery in the Wadi Raiân, that\r\nit is “evidently the Bakkhis of Ptolemy.” Thus we have this\r\nmonastery identified as Dionysias by Cope Whitehouse, as Bakkhis by\r\nDr. Schweinfurth, whereas Flinders Petrie places both Dionysias and\r\nBakkhis on the far side of the Fayûm depression. Who shall decide\r\nwhen savants disagree?\r\n\r\nIn his papers on Lake Mœris, Mr. Whitehouse makes reference to _two_\r\nlakes, and I believe his theory of two lakes is based on some ancient\r\nmaps.[5] I have not seen the map or maps, but I should expect the\r\nlakes represented to be intended for Lake Qurûn in the Fayûm,\r\nand a corresponding lake in the Gharaq basin. The Gharaq basin is\r\nthe Fayûm depression repeated on a small scale, and at some period\r\nof its development towards total reclamation from the waters that\r\ncovered it, it must have had a lake at its south and lowest end,\r\ncorresponding to the Birket-el-Qurûn, but of smaller dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe Gharaq basin is connected with the Fayûm depression by a gap in\r\nits surrounding higher lands with sill at R.L. 16·00. Consequently\r\nthe basin would not have begun to dry up from evaporation till the\r\nFayûm Lake had fallen below R.L. 16·00, and probably the fall was\r\nnot continuous, but, through some accident at Hawârah or elsewhere,\r\nthe Fayûm Lake, after falling below R.L. 16·00, may have risen\r\nagain and re-drowned the reclaimed land in the Gharaq. This may have\r\noccurred more than once, and have given rise to the name “Gharaq,”\r\nor the “Flooded.”\r\n\r\nMr. Whitehouse, in his latest expression of views, supposes the\r\nFayûm and the Wadi Raiân were filled to R.L. 30·00. I have given\r\nreasons for concluding there was never any Nile water in the Wadi\r\nRaiân. The evidence furnished also by Nile deposit and fresh-water\r\nshells on the Fayûm side of the entrance at Lahûn shows that the\r\nlevel of 30 was never reached.\r\n\r\nThe highest Nile deposit near and on the Fayûm side of Lahûn is\r\nat about R.L. 26·00. The highest in the Fayûm near the Hawârah\r\npyramid, which is on the edge of the Fayûm basin, is at R.L. 24·50\r\nor thereabouts. The highest level of the lake was probably never\r\nmore than one metre above this level, and it is therefore almost\r\ncertain that the water-level was never sufficiently high to flow\r\ninto the Wadi Raiân; and _if_ it ever did, it must have been but\r\nrarely, when extraordinarily high and prolonged Niles occurred; so\r\nthat it must be concluded, if my views are correct, that the normal\r\ncondition of the Wadi Raiân was then, as now, that of a dry waterless\r\ndepression in the desert, and it cannot therefore be considered as\r\nhaving been Lake Mœris, or a part of it even, _at any time_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                LINANT’S OBJECTIONS TO THEORY FAVOURED.\r\n\r\n_Author’s Views of Lake Mœris generally stated._—I myself agree\r\nwith those who are of opinion that the Fayûm Province, or depression,\r\n(including the Gharaq Basin and the neck from Lahûn to Hawârah),\r\nwas by itself Lake Mœris, and that within its limits and along its\r\nborders was to be found the inhabited and cultivated region known as\r\nthe Arsinoïte Nome, which possibly also extended into the Nile Valley\r\nalong the course of the canal connecting the Nile with the lake.\r\n\r\nThe Fayûm then in its submerged state was, I believe, the Lake\r\nMœris of Herodotus, Strabo, Diodorus, and Pliny, the modern Lake\r\nQurûn being the persistent rudiment of this lake, and all that now\r\nremains of its formerly extensive sheet of water. (See Plate XX.)\r\n\r\n_Objections urged by Linant against these views._—This is no new\r\ntheory. It is found _passim_ before Linant Pasha in 1842 took great\r\npains to point out its absurdity, but it was his own assumptions\r\nregarding the maximum height which the water surface of Lake Qurûn\r\ncould have reached, that created the absurdity. Assuming without\r\nevidence that the villages on the second plateau were all in existence\r\nat the time of Lake Mœris, he limits the level of Lake Qurûn to\r\nthe edge of the second plateau, which is the same thing as laying\r\ndown that its water surface never rose above R.L. + 10·00.\r\n\r\nHaving come to this conclusion, he might have spared himself all\r\nhis arguments against the theory, other than that which pointed out\r\nthat a reservoir in the Fayûm at this level could have been of no\r\nutility in supplementing the low waters of the Nile.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, instructive to note how he deals with the arguments\r\nagainst this lake, which his imagination set bounds to, being\r\nLake Mœris. After a separate review of each condition which Lake\r\nMœris should fulfil and which the limited Lake Qurûn did not,\r\nhe closes his reviews with the remark that “we may then conclude\r\nthat Birket-el-Qurûn is not the Lake Mœris.” But he does not\r\ndo so _always_. Should the condition be one with which his own\r\ntheory is not in agreement, he explains it away or discredits it. The\r\ndimensions assigned to Lake Mœris by the ancient historians evidently\r\ntrouble him, and he does his best to discredit their testimony on\r\nthis point. After discussing this condition, he does not end his\r\nargument with the usual conclusion that “the present Lake Qurûn\r\ncannot be Lake Mœris,” but he says “an absolute importance must\r\nnot be attached to all these measures in order to draw from them\r\nconclusions either positive or negative as to the identity of the\r\nposition of Birket-el-Qurûn with that of the ancient Lake Mœris.”\r\n\r\nThe depth assigned to Lake Mœris also gives rise to the following\r\nremarks, which will afford the means of judging of the value of\r\nM. Linant’s arguments. He states that Herodotus gives the depth\r\nof the lake at 92 metres, and remarks that if the whole Fayûm had\r\nbeen filled to form the lake, its dimensions would have surpassed\r\nby ten times the greatest given for it.\r\n\r\nBut as a matter of fact, they do not even _come up to_ the greatest\r\ndimensions given, which are, for the depth 92 metres, and for the\r\nperimeter of the lake 720 kilometres (450 miles), or, assuming as he\r\ndoes that Herodotus made use of the small stadius, 360 kilometres. Now\r\nthe perimeter of the Fayûm is 220 kilometres, and if that of the Wadi\r\nRaiân is added, namely 200 kilometres, the total perimeter becomes\r\n420 and that figure is only obtained by measuring the indentations\r\nof the Wadi Raiân, which is of a peculiar shape.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the Fayûm Lake, if filled to say R.L. + 25·00,\r\nwould be not less than (25·00 + 43·50 + 5·00 =) 73·50 metres,\r\nnor more than 88·00 at the highest estimate.\r\n\r\nThese dimensions agree approximately with those given by Herodotus,\r\nand are not, as rashly stated by Linant, ten times in excess.\r\n\r\nTo show with what unfairness Linant deals with statements made by\r\nHerodotus, his arguments about the bricks made for the pyramid built\r\nby Asychis may be noted. It was stated that the bricks were made\r\nfrom mud brought up from the bottom of the lake. Linant claims this\r\nstatement as supporting his theory, as his lake was a shallow one,\r\nand as opposing the enlarged Lake Qurûn theory, as this latter would\r\nbe a deep one. It does not seem to strike him that the workmen could\r\nhave sought their mud along the shallow margins of the larger lake. He\r\nfurther argues that one could not reach down more than 4 metres with\r\npoles, and therefore the lake could not have been so deep as stated\r\nby Herodotus, and hence Herodotus contradicts himself! But Herodotus\r\ndid not say that the lake was 92 metres deep all over, and that its\r\nshores were not shallow, but that its _greatest_ depth was 92 metres.\r\n\r\nLinant Pasha discussed the possibility of the submerged Fayûm\r\nbeing the Lake Mœris, but rejected the idea, because, to fulfil\r\nthe condition of supplementing the low Nile, the water must have\r\ncovered the second plateau, and risen to a level above the rock\r\nsill at Hawârah (R.L. 21·00). “Then,” he points out, “the\r\nwhole Fayûm would have been only a vast lake and with a height of\r\nwater impossible to reconcile with the existence of large towns,\r\nwhich formed the rich Crocodilopolite or Arsinoïte nomes. The\r\ngreat quantity of ruined towns, abandoned like Medinet-el-Mahdi,\r\nMedinet-el-Hêb, Medinet Nemroud, Kasr Keroun, indicate, as well\r\nas those which still exist, as Sanuris, Sanhur and all the others,\r\nthat this part has never been under water, and they date from the\r\ntime of Lake Mœris and of Crocodilopolis.” (Earlier in his book he\r\nstates about Kasr Keroun, “Kasr Keroun is a little monument, quite\r\nmodern as compared with the epoch of the Labyrinth.” Mr. Petrie\r\nand Dr. Schweinfurth both state that Qasr Qurûn is a Roman temple\r\nor town.) M. Linant continues, “If ever the Fayûm has been under\r\nwater, as we have supposed it, it was long before it was habitable\r\nand before the Lake Mœris existed.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\nOLD BUILDING ON NORTH SIDE OF LAKE QURÛN,\r\n\r\nDISCOVERED BY DR. SCHWEINFURTH IN 1884. EXTERIOR FROM NORTH-EAST.]\r\n\r\nNow as regards the modern villages of Sanûris, Sanhûr, and others,\r\nI am not aware on what evidence M. Linant states that they existed\r\nat the same time as Lake Mœris. As regards the old abandoned towns\r\nmentioned, some of them are on elevated spots, and probably were\r\non the shores of Lake Mœris. When Lake Mœris declined and the\r\nwater had receded to a distance from them, they were abandoned for\r\nmore favourable sites, less remote from a water supply and water\r\ntransport. Probably Sanûris and Sanhûr, and the other villages on\r\nthe edge of the second plateau, are the successors in time of the\r\nancient elevated towns mentioned as ruined and abandoned.\r\n\r\nThus, instead of considering the remains of the old high-level\r\nabandoned towns as evidence destructive of the theory that the whole\r\nFayûm was filled with water, I consider their testimony distinctly\r\nfavours such a theory.\r\n\r\nThose towns especially, whose ruins are found on the _north_ side of\r\nLake Qurûn, would certainly have been built near the then borders of\r\nthe lake, as they could have had no possible source of water supply\r\nother than the lake itself. It, therefore, is a matter of great\r\ninterest to determine the levels of any ancient towns that may be\r\nfound on the north of the lake; and the more ancient the town and\r\nthe more remote from the present lake, the more suggestive will be\r\nthe facts that may be ascertained with reference to its levels.\r\n\r\nNow there are two monuments of antiquity known in such a situation,\r\nnamely, the ruins of Dimay (Dimeh or Dimé) and an ancient temple\r\n(if it is a temple) discovered by Dr. Schweinfurth 7 or 8 kilometres\r\nnorth of Dimay.[6] Dimay itself is 3 kilometres from the nearest point\r\nof the present Lake Qurûn, and the surface of its causeway or quay\r\nat its upper end, near the old town, is 69 metres above the water\r\nsurface of the lake (May 2nd, 1892), or at R.L. + 25·44. The south\r\nend of the quay is now about 2·85 metres lower, but it was doubtless\r\noriginally somewhat higher than this, as its present is not apparently\r\nits original surface, some of the layers of stone having disappeared.\r\n\r\nI had a trench dug against this quay or causeway, at about the\r\nmiddle of its length, to determine the depth to which the masonry\r\nwas carried down.\r\n\r\nIf this had been merely a causeway, it is not easy to understand\r\nthe necessity for so great a depth of masonry. It was therefore more\r\nprobably a quay projecting into the water. This quay is 400 metres\r\nlong, and its direction is due north and south. The level of the\r\nplateau sloping up to the end of the causeway on the south of Dimay\r\nis from R.L. 13·00 to 17·00; the plateau on the north side of the\r\nruins is at R.L. 21·45.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Dimay are Roman on the surface, but I do not know if\r\nit has been established that below the Roman remains there do not\r\nexist more ancient ones. Dr. Schweinfurth thus expresses his opinion\r\nabout this old town: “Dimé seems to have filled the position of\r\n‘tête-de-pont’ in relation to the Fayûm, as in consequence of\r\nits strong position, it afforded a secure outlet and final station\r\nfor the caravan road opening out towards the Oasis. That the tribes\r\nof the Libyan Desert must even in the times of the Romans have been\r\nvery restless and enterprising, is testified by the numerous similar\r\nfortifications, which in the day of the so-called good emperor,\r\nwere erected on all the principal exits and entrances to the Oasis\r\nroads.”\r\n\r\nSeven or eight kilometres north of Dimay (magnetic bearing from north\r\nentrance in Dimay enclosure wall 12° east of north) is found the\r\nancient so-called temple, discovered by Dr. Schweinfurth in 1884. I\r\ngive here photographs of the exterior and interior of the building,\r\nas well as its ground plan, that those who are capable of judging\r\nmay have the means of estimating from them its probable age. (Plates\r\nXIV., XV., and XVI.) The important level, so far as the subject\r\nof this paper is concerned, of the old town, marked by mounds of\r\nancient pottery on the south of the “temple,” was determined\r\non the occasion of my visit. The level of the upper parts of these\r\nmounds was found to be R.L. + 24·58. The pottery was, of course,\r\nspread out to lower levels, but probably the ancient town was built\r\nbetween the levels of 23·00 and 26·00.\r\n\r\nDr. Schweinfurth remarks that the buildings dating from the XIIIth\r\nDynasty are all distinguished by the same kind of four-cornered\r\narrangement as this temple and generally scorn every kind of ornament;\r\nand he notes that the great size of the blocks and peculiar method\r\nof fitting the stones together give it a resemblance in style to\r\nother old buildings. Instead of giving his further description, I\r\nrefer to the ground plan and photographs. It is worth noticing that\r\nthe north-west room has no visible means of communication either\r\nwith the exterior or with the other chambers of the building; also\r\nthat the displacement of the stones, forming the upper half of the\r\nchambers on the raised floor, is suggestive of an earthquake, the\r\nupper stones having slid on the lower to a measurable extent in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction. Cracks in the roofing stones corresponding\r\nwith the displacement seem to confirm the theory of earthquake action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n\r\nINTERIOR OF DR. SCHWEINFURTH’S “TEMPLE,”\r\n\r\nFROM WEST END OF OPEN ROOM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\nPLAN OF OLD BUILDING DISCOVERED BY DR. G. SCHWEINFURTH IN 1884.\r\n\r\nHeight of chambers from surface of raised floor to ceiling\r\n2·65. Scale ¹⁄₁₀₀. Dimensions in metres.]\r\n\r\nThe object of the building is a riddle. Each of the raised cells\r\nhas a recess for a door. “In the thickness of the south wall,\r\non the east side of the principal entrance, runs a passage half a\r\nmetre wide, leading to which, at the south-east corner of the temple,\r\na door of equally narrow proportions is attached. This passage leads\r\ndownwards to the chambers below” (Schweinfurth). Dr. Schweinfurth\r\ncame to the conclusion “that the old temple, as well as the original\r\nsettlement or formation, is one of the monuments belonging to the\r\noldest times.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the old town he writes:—“In the neighbourhood of\r\nthe temple, from south-east to south-west, at a distance of about\r\n500 paces, that is, on the edge of the rising ground, there are\r\nquantities of potsherds lying in heaps here and there. They are of\r\nthe most weather-worn appearance, and have formed portions of coarse,\r\nthick vessels. No such things as fragments approaching the pottery\r\nwork of the Greek or Roman period are found. The eye of the seeker\r\nsought in vain for remnants of that blue glazed pottery ordinarily\r\nso common, or the long amphoræ of the Greek shape.\r\n\r\n“The amphoræ points or ends, which I picked up, were all stumps,\r\nand of an almost cylindrical shape. The corresponding pottery\r\nshowed no sign of rings. They were almost entirely coarse, red\r\nclay fragments, with here and there a yellow or black bit, and all\r\ndistinctly showed the work of the potter’s wheel.\r\n\r\n“Below the scarp of the lowest rising ground no more pottery was\r\nto be found, neither did the marl mounds display on examination\r\nany admixture of manufactured pieces. The heaps of pottery formerly\r\nexisting appear to have been flattened down and spread out over a\r\nmuch wider space by the disintegration and sweeping down of the marl\r\nbed. A similar occurrence may be observed on the few stone walls\r\nyet remaining of the old temple settlement.”\r\n\r\nFor Schweinfurth’s further remarks see pp. 101 to 107 of his\r\nveloci-graphed letter to Paul Ascherson on his journey in the\r\ndepression of the Fayûm, 1886.\r\n\r\nThe line of levels, which I had taken between this old building\r\n(temple) and Dimay, followed a direct line between the two, crossing\r\nthe elevations and depressions given in the list below:—\r\n\r\n                _From Schweinfurth’s “Temple” to Dimay._\r\n\r\n                                                                  R.L.\r\n\r\n  Floor surface of raised chamber on left of central chamber      35·506\r\n\r\n  Pottery mound of old settlement                                 24·580\r\n\r\n  First depression on line of levels                               9·611\r\n\r\n  Following elevation                                             16·521\r\n\r\n  Second depression                                                6·096\r\n\r\n  Following elevation                                             14·461\r\n\r\n  Third depression                                                 7·716\r\n\r\n  Plateau north of Dimay                                          21·448\r\n\r\n  On ruined mounds in Dimay enclosure                             28·368\r\n\r\n  Causeway at undamaged upper end                                 25·438\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _From Dimay to Lake Qurûn._\r\n\r\n  Causeway                                                        25·438\r\n\r\n  Plateau north of Dimay, upper end                               17·000\r\n\r\n    „       „             lower end                               13·270\r\n\r\n  Fossils plentiful between                                      - 3·500\r\n\r\n                        and                                     - 13·000\r\n\r\n  Water surface, Lake Qurûn, May 2nd, 1892                      - 43·540\r\n\r\nThese levels I am convinced are correct, as they were taken with the\r\nutmost care, as I myself saw, by Messrs. W. O. Joseph and A. Pini,\r\nwho had been in constant practice at levelling. The levels between\r\nLake Qurûn and Dimay were taken twice over; the first levels,\r\ntaken by Monsieur Pini alone, giving a difference of level between\r\nthe lake and causeway of 68·952 metres, while the difference found,\r\nwhen both read, was 68·978.\r\n\r\nThe levels for the old town near Schweinfurth’s “temple”\r\nhaving been found to be from R.L. 23 to 26, the theory that Lake\r\nMœris was a little below the level of R.L. 23·00 is favoured by\r\nthe determination of this level. The presence and peculiarities of\r\nthe quay at Dimay, if it is such, and the existence of an old town\r\non the heights where the Dimay ruins stand, if they can be used as\r\nevidence of what the lake level used to be, point to high levels\r\nrather than to low ones, and do not answer to Linant’s appeal to\r\nthe old abandoned towns to bear witness in his favour.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the levels of Dimay and Schweinfurth’s “temple” the\r\nlevels of the ruins of Biahmu should be studied. These are given on\r\nPlates XXII. and XXIII.\r\n\r\nThe top of the highest corner-stone of the enclosure wall, now _in\r\nsitu_, is at R.L. 21·59, and, accepting Mr. Petrie’s restoration of\r\nthese ruins, the top of this wall, when complete, would have been at\r\nR.L. 23·00, which would seem to indicate that the maximum water-level\r\nof the lake was below R.L. 23·00, but higher than R.L. 17·00, the\r\nlevel of the ground outside the enclosure. These ruins are referred\r\nto more fully on p. 83 _et seq_.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Flinders Petrie’s Views of Lake Mœris._—Having discussed\r\nthe theories of Linant Pasha and Mr. Cope Whitehouse, the only\r\ntwo that I can find stated with any distinctness, and the only\r\nones that have been put forward by travellers having a personal\r\nacquaintance with the Fayûm, I will, before setting forth my own\r\nreading of the past history of the province and my theory as to its\r\nconnection or identity with Lake Mœris, first give Mr. Petrie’s\r\nviews, who should be included with the two foregoing theorists,\r\nas a traveller having a personal acquaintance with the Fayûm, and,\r\nin a special line, a very intimate one. I do not think that he would\r\nclaim that the expression of his views constitutes the enunciation\r\nof a new theory of Lake Mœris, but only his way of viewing an old\r\ntheory with some side-lights of his own added by way of illumination.\r\n\r\nThe views, that I have adopted, are in general agreement with those\r\nfavoured by Mr. Petrie, and as he, an Egyptologist and archæologist,\r\nhas thrown light on the subject from his standpoint, I propose to make\r\nthe same attempt from my point of view as the Public Works officer\r\nin charge of the irrigation of the Fayûm. The working out of the\r\nproblem of Lake Mœris would seem to require an alliance between\r\na palæontologist, an archæologist, an Egyptologist, a geologist,\r\nand a hydraulic engineer.\r\n\r\nThe following is copied from ‘Hawara, Biahmu, and Arsinoë,’ by\r\nW. M. Flinders Petrie, published in 1889:—\r\n\r\n“Medinet el Fayûm (Plate XVII.) is the modern town which represents\r\nthe ancient Arsinoë, so named by Ptolemy Philadelphos in honour\r\nof his sister-wife; it lies at the extreme south of the old site,\r\nwhich covers a space of over a mile long and half a mile wide, a\r\nvast wilderness of mounds strewn with pottery. At the opposite end\r\nof the ruins, toward the north, is the great temple enclosure of the\r\nold Egyptian town. Before its name of Arsinoë, the city had obtained\r\nthe name of Crocodilopolis, from the worship of the sacred crocodiles\r\nmaintained there; and still earlier it was known as Shed, meaning,\r\napparently, that which is saved, cut out, delivered, or extracted,\r\nreferring to the district being reclaimed from the great lake. The\r\nwhole province was known as Ta-she, ‘the land of the lake’; and,\r\nwhatever may have been the mistakes of historians about Lake Moiris,\r\nthere is no doubt that the lake was the main feature of the district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.\r\n\r\nVIEW OF MEDINET EL FAYÛM,\r\n\r\nWHICH OCCUPIES PART OF THE SITE OF THE ANCIENT TOWN CALLED\r\nSUCCESSIVELY “SHED,” “CROCODILOPOLIS,” AND “ARSINOË.”]\r\n\r\n“So many opinions have been broached about Lake Moiris that an\r\naccount of antiquities in the Fayûm without mentioning it would seem\r\nimpossible. So, although my work has not been in that line, yet it\r\nwill be well to state what seems to be the truth about it, in order\r\nthat some collateral questions should be the better understood. For\r\nthe following view of the use of the great dyke I am indebted\r\nto Colonel Ross, R.E., C.M.G., who has professionally considered\r\nthe subject. The Fayûm is one of the oases of the Libyan Desert,\r\nlying close to the Nile Valley; and the intervening ground is low\r\nenough for the Nile to pour into the basin. The fall from the Nile\r\nValley to where the channel widens out into the Fayûm is about 12\r\nfeet; and the water flows over the province by canals and ravines,\r\nworn through the rock and its superincumbent mud, until the streams\r\nfinally collect in the Birket Kurûn at more than 200 feet below\r\nthe Nile level, and, indeed, 130 feet below the sea. The present\r\narea of cultivation is about 20 miles in each direction; but the\r\nwhole basin, geographically speaking, is about 40 miles across on\r\nan average. This does not include the secondary basin of the Wadi\r\nRaian to the south, which never had any connection with the Fayûm\r\nbasin in historic times, the ground rising over 100 feet above Nile\r\nlevel between the two depressions.\r\n\r\n“In pre-historic times the Nile Valley was full of water to a\r\nfar greater depth than at present, probably 100 to 200 feet deep of\r\nwater filled it right across. A river of such a size seems almost\r\nincredible, and we naturally should suppose it to have been an\r\nestuary; but this must not be too hastily assumed, as there are\r\nevidences over the whole country of an enormous rainfall, which\r\nploughed up the cliffs with great ravines; while the bare bed\r\nof the old Nile in the eastern desert at Silsileh is some miles\r\nin width, showing what a large volume of water has filled it; a\r\nlesser stream would have cut down a deep channel in the old bed,\r\nand would never have filled that and topped the rocks to force its\r\npresent cut. This pre-historic high Nile is not, however, pre-human,\r\nas I found a palæolithic flint high up on the hills to the west\r\nof Esneh, clearly river-worn. The geologic conditions, then, in the\r\npre-historic time prove that the Fayûm Basin must have been a vast\r\nlake, connected by a broad arm with the Nile Valley. Thick beds of\r\nNile mud exist beneath 10 to 20 feet of deposits washed down from the\r\ndesert hills; and even this desert detritus is strewn with felspar\r\nand quartz pebbles brought in by the Nile from Assuan, and now lying\r\nhigh above the present Nile level. As the rainfall ceased, and the\r\nNile fell, the neck of water was reduced, but it still sufficed as\r\na channel for the filling of the Fayûm, in all probability, in the\r\ntime of the earliest dynasties. The Nile bed has risen, it is true,\r\n4 inches a century by its deposits; and hence at the time of the XIIth\r\ndynasty, when it was down to its present volume of water, it probably\r\nstood about 14 feet lower than it does now in the Nile Valley; but\r\nas the drop to the point of flow into the Fayûm is at present 12\r\nfeet below high Nile, and the water-level has risen somewhat there,\r\nit is pretty well certain that the Fayûm Basin continued during the\r\nearly dynasties to receive the inflow of the Nile as it had done for\r\nages before. This, then, was the state in which the great engineering\r\nmonarchs of Egypt found the province; a basin full of overflow Nile\r\nwater, replenished at each inundation through a marshy shallow inlet,\r\nand with much of its bottom so raised by deposits as to have become\r\nalmost marsh ground, like the present lakes about the coast.\r\n\r\n“Amenemhat I. is the earliest king of whom we have any evidence\r\nin the Fayûm. He appears to have reclaimed the site of the capital,\r\nShed, ‘the separated’ or ‘extracted,’ and thus he established\r\n‘the land of the lake.’ The dyke of Amenemhat I. may perhaps be\r\nseen in a fragment of an enormous bank which remains on the north\r\nof the temple area at Medinet. It cannot be part of the temenos\r\nwall, as it is far too thick in proportion; and no king later than\r\nAmenemhat I. would need to place a dam so near to the capital. The\r\ngreat dyke noticed by Linant—if indeed it be ancient, which some\r\nhave doubted—is probably the further reclamation of Amenemhat III.,\r\nsignalised by his erecting at Biahmu two great statues of himself at\r\nthe projecting corner of it looking over the lake, and flanking the\r\nroad on either side. That the water was on the lower and not the upper\r\nside of the dyke, as Linant supposed, is proved by the levels. For if\r\nthe area within the dyke had been covered with water as a reservoir,\r\nthe Biahmu structures would have been submerged some 12 feet; whereas\r\nthere is no trace of deposited mud on any of the upper stones, nor is\r\nthe building such that it is likely to have been placed in a depth of\r\nwater. (See Plates 22 and 23.) The work of Amenemhat III. consisted\r\nin reclaiming more land, and damming back the lake to narrower limits,\r\nwhile improving the canals which led in and out of it, so as to render\r\nit more effective in co-operating with the Nile. He thus established\r\nLake Mœris, and his works gave him the credit of being its founder\r\nin later ages. In the time of Herodotos the lake still seems to\r\nhave been kept up to its high level, and if this view be correct,\r\nwe ought not to find any pre-Greek remains in the Fayûm below Nile\r\nlevel outside of the great dyke; so far as is at present known this\r\nis the case. The circumference mentioned by Herodotos as equal to the\r\ncoast of Egypt, would have been about 130 miles, against 180 length\r\nof the coast-line; so this statement is but little exaggerated. The\r\nlength in stadia is, however, evidently wrong. Apparently under the\r\nPersians or Ptolemies the desire to acquire more land in the Fayûm at\r\nthe expense of the irrigation of the Nile Valley, led to restricting\r\nthe inflow, and gradually drying up the lake. It was reduced greatly\r\nduring the Greek period, as the temple of Kasr Kerûn, of Roman age,\r\non the shore of the Birket Kurûn, is 72 feet below Nile level; and\r\nDimeh, a Roman town, is at 69 feet, and has a quay, I am informed, at\r\nabout 87 feet below the Nile.[7] The shrinkage of the lake, however,\r\nwent on until it has now left the Roman quay 130 feet high in the\r\nair, and the Nile falls over 200 feet before its waters evaporate\r\nfrom the lake. The present problem is how just to let in enough for\r\ncultivation without any surplus, and so still further reduce the lake,\r\nand increase the area for crops.\r\n\r\n“The general level of cultivated land in the Fayûm has not risen\r\nby deposits as in the Nile Valley; the denudation by the rapid\r\ndrainage into the lake just compensating the rise by deposit which\r\nwould otherwise take place. The evidence for this is seen on the east\r\nside of Arsinoë, where the Bahr Tirseh has cut a clean section of\r\nthe mounds, and the undisturbed bed of Nile mud beneath the ruins\r\nis seen to be at just the same level as the fields at present. Also\r\nat Biahmu it is certain that the ground has never been much below\r\nits present level, or the foundations would have been washed out;\r\nnor has it risen much above the level apparently, as the highest\r\nmud on the stones is only three feet over the present soil. The fact\r\nseems to be that it slowly rose while the lake was at a high level,\r\nuntil it was about two feet higher; and then it has denuded since\r\nthe lake was reduced, and drainage set in, until it is now perhaps\r\na foot below the ancient level of the XIIth dynasty.”\r\n\r\nI have quoted Mr. Petrie in full, as he is reputed to be accurate\r\nin his statement of facts, and undoubtedly is so as regards his own\r\ndiscoveries and excavations.\r\n\r\nI must now pass on to my own views, and set them forth in more detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     HISTORY OF THE FAYÛM PROVINCE — THE FAYÛM BEFORE LAKE MŒRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe past history of the Fayûm Province was probably the following.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, the sea covered the whole of the area which\r\nafterwards became the Nile Valley and its bordering hills. By a slow\r\nprocess of upheaval the dry land appeared above the level of the\r\nwaters, but, in the process, what was formerly the uniform bed of the\r\nsea became an uneven surface with heights and depressions and faults.\r\n\r\nThe Nile Valley, the Fayûm and Wadi Raiân depressions were the\r\nultimate result of this action, the formation of the Nile Valley being\r\ncompleted by the flow of water. At first the upper reaches of the Nile\r\nValley held its waters at a high level by barriers of rock, but in\r\nprocess of time these barriers were cut through, the bed scoured out\r\nby the constant flow of water, and the water surface lowered beyond\r\nits present levels, to be again gradually raised to the levels of\r\nto-day. The lower reaches of the Nile Valley were probably at first\r\noccupied by the sea, until the yearly deposit of the floods formed\r\nthe Delta, and pushed the land thus formed further and further out,\r\nforcing the sea to retire. As the surface of the Delta became raised\r\nand prolonged by successive annual deposits, the bed and water-surface\r\nof the Nile also would have risen with it, until the levels at which\r\nthe Nile flowed in its lower reaches became those of the present day.\r\n\r\nAt a point in the hills dividing the Nile Valley and the Fayûm, about\r\n10 kilometres south of Lahûn, near Sidment-el-Gebel, Dr. Schweinfurth\r\nfound “the indubitable witnesses of a Pliocene sea” preserved in\r\nthe form of oysters (_Ostrea cucullata_ and _Pecten_) in the white\r\nsand at about R.L. 60 to 70. (See map and Plate XXI.) The Pliocene\r\nsea, he maintains, intruded up the Nile Valley and extended on both\r\nsides of it as far as the contours of 60 to 70 metres above sea-level\r\nallowed. The place, where the oysters in the white sand were found,\r\nis situated in a flat depression on the plateau of the narrowest part\r\nof the hills separating the Nile Valley and the Fayûm. The Pliocene\r\nsea flowed here from one depression into the other, and would have\r\nsucceeded in scouring away the barrier between the two depressions,\r\nif it had not been interrupted by a later upheaval or a withdrawal of\r\nthe sea. In a similar manner there seems to have been made from Lahûn\r\nto Hawârah, the present communication between the Nile Valley and the\r\nFayûm by which the Bahr Yûsuf entered to form Lake Mœris, either\r\nas an old Nile-arm or as an artificial branch of the natural arm.\r\n\r\nBesides this passage, the desert tract on the north of it offers,\r\nas breaks in the higher ridge, several depressions, which must have\r\nbeen accessible to the Pliocene sea. The present railway line to\r\nthe Fayûm crosses the hills at one of these depressions.\r\n\r\nOn account of the regularity of the limestone strata in the Fayûm\r\nand Wadi Raiân, a violent upheaval cannot be supposed to have been\r\nthe cause that produced these two depressions, and it is more likely\r\nthat they are the results of erosion and scour.\r\n\r\nIn a passage I have already quoted from Mr. Petrie’s writings, he\r\nstates that in prehistoric times the Nile was a vastly greater river\r\nthan it is now, due to an enormous rainfall. Let us then assume the\r\nPliocene sea-level at R.L. 60 to 70, according to Dr. Schweinfurth,\r\nand an enormous volume of water coming down from the Upper Nile Valley\r\naccording to Mr. Petrie. The sea which then invaded the Nile Valley\r\nwould have been in communication with the Red Sea, and may have had\r\na tide of 5 metres range, which would have complicated the currents,\r\nand added to the scouring action. Below Wâstah, the channel of the\r\nNile Valley, contained between the Libyan and Arabian Hills, is much\r\ncontracted. Under these conditions the floods from the Upper Nile\r\nwould escape sideways through the depressions in the Libyan Hills\r\ninto the Fayûm and the Wadi Raiân; into the latter by way of the\r\nWadi Muellah, and possibly by other connections with the Nile Valley\r\nof a low enough level.\r\n\r\nA large volume of water would thus be forced westwards out of the\r\nNile Valley, and would find its way towards the sea to the west\r\nof Alexandria. In its endeavours to dig out a channel for itself\r\nit would erode laterally, or scour down vertically according as\r\nthe softer material was found in one direction or the other. The\r\ndifferent points of delivery and volumes of the water contributing\r\nto the flow, and the nature of the rock met with in its path would\r\ndetermine the form the channel would take at the various stages of\r\nits development. Tremendous eddies would be produced by projections\r\nof hard rock and contractions of the irregular channels, which would\r\nlift material from the bed and produce deep holes.\r\n\r\nHad this action not been arrested by the further upheaval of the\r\nland, perhaps a second Nile Valley would have been formed branching\r\nfrom the main valley at Behnesa, passing through the Wadi Raiân and\r\nFayûm depression, and continuing through the Wadis Fadhi and Faragh,\r\nwest of Memphis and Cairo, to the Natron Lakes, and thence to the sea\r\nwest of Alexandria; or returning to the Nile Valley, or side of what\r\nis now the Delta, but was then sea, at some point south of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nIf this theory is a sound one, the remarkable depressions of the\r\nFayûm and Wadi Raiân are paralleled on a small scale by the deep\r\nholes (_bayarât_) scoured out below the bridges or cuts in the\r\nUpper Egypt Basin embankments, or outside a breach in a Nile bank.\r\n\r\nThe section, given on Plate XVIII., of 50 miles of the Nile Valley\r\nand desert opposite Cairo, is taken from Mr. Cope Whitehouse’s\r\narticle, entitled “The Pyramid Hill of Gizeh,” which appeared\r\nin the ‘Quarterly’ some time ago. It shows (assuming it on\r\nMr. Whitehouse’s authority to be a correct representation of the\r\nground) the channels, that I have named, in the arrested state of\r\ndevelopment which they had reached, when the flow of water, which\r\nwas digging them out, was cut off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\nSECTION OF 50 MILES ON LAT. 30°.\r\n\r\nBorrowed from Cope Whitehouse.\r\n\r\n_Note._—The dotted line represents the level of the Pliocene Sea,\r\nbut is not in Cope Whitehouse’s section, which was drawn for\r\nanother purpose.]\r\n\r\nAfter the upheaval had raised their borders above sea-level, the sea\r\nwould be henceforward excluded from the depressions and be replaced\r\nby the waters of the Nile, which would have entered by the gap in\r\nthe Libyan Hills at Lahûn. The upheaval continuing and the Nile\r\nat the same time scouring out its bed, a condition of levels would\r\nhave come about, under which there would have been an annual inflow\r\nduring the floods and outflow into the Nile on the floods subsiding.\r\n\r\nIn a long series of years there would result a thick deposit of Nile\r\nmud in the Fayûm, the richest deposit being found near the point\r\nwhere the waters first spread themselves out after passing through\r\nthe comparatively narrow defile in the Libyan Hills. The tendency\r\nof the entrance of the waters, heavily charged with silt, into an\r\nextended basin filled with water would be to form a delta of Nile\r\ndeposit similar to that which the Nile itself has formed in entering\r\nthe sea, modified by the form of the basin bed, which would not have\r\nbeen uniform like that of the sea. On account of the momentum of\r\nthe body of water leaving the defile and entering the lake, there\r\nwould be formed a projecting ridge (contour R.L. 23) of deposit in\r\nthe direction of the flow, while the deposit, resulting from the\r\nend and side spills, would form in gentle slopes with approximately\r\nparallel and rounded contours (R.L. 17 to 10) on both sides, and at\r\nthe end of the projecting ridge as shown in Plate XIX.\r\n\r\nThus, in consequence of the former action of rain on the surrounding\r\nhills, greater or less at different points along the borders according\r\nas the inclination of the adjacent watersheds was towards or away\r\nfrom the depression, and in consequence also of the deposition of\r\nNile mud by the annual entry of the river flood, the bed of the\r\nlake formed in the depression would take the shape shown by the\r\ncontours on the diagram of the Fayûm, Plate XIX. The former of\r\nthese processes of change of the bed and borders of the depression\r\nmay have ceased before the latter commenced to operate, or both\r\nmay have acted simultaneously or alternately, which would account\r\nfor layers of Nile mud being found near the Hawârah pyramid lying\r\nbelow the water-borne detritus of the hills.\r\n\r\nFrom a knowledge of the rules which govern the formation of a Delta,\r\nand the consequent raising of the level of the river which forms it,\r\nwe might conclude that the Nile floods in past times were not as high\r\nas they are nowadays, though on the other hand we do not know that\r\nthe floods were not greater in volume, and the probability is that\r\nthey were. But whatever may be the truth about former Nile levels,\r\nthe levels, at which Nile deposits are found in the Fayûm, furnish\r\nevidence of the maximum height to which the flood waters rose in\r\nthe Lake.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the passage by which the waters entered the\r\nFayûm, the highest Nile deposit is at R.L. 26·00. At Hawârah it\r\nis at R.L. 24·50, and along the ridge reaching out towards Medineh,\r\nR.L. 23·50. Probably, therefore, the water in the Lake reached\r\nabout R.L. 26·50 at the commencement of the gorge, but the level\r\nof the Lake itself rarely, if ever, exceeded R.L. 25·00.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\nCONTOURED DIAGRAM OF THE FAYÛM DEPRESSION.\r\n\r\n_Note._—This being a diagram only, all minor folds and indentations\r\nof contours have been suppressed, so as to show more clearly the\r\ngeneral shape.\r\n\r\nThe upper contours along the north-west side of the Lake must not\r\nbe considered to be accurately represented, as no surveys of this\r\nside have been made.]\r\n\r\nIt will be as well to determine, before going further, whether the\r\npresent volumes of the Nile flood would suffice to fill the Lake\r\nFayûm to the level of R.L. 25·00, which I have assumed it must\r\nhave reached to account for the Nile deposits on its borders at\r\nR.L. 24·50.\r\n\r\nAt the time we are considering, no artificial works existed for\r\ncontrolling the inflow and outflow of the Lake.\r\n\r\nWe have first to determine the lowest level to which the Lake would\r\nhave been lowered by the outflow and evaporation at the end of the\r\nsummer, and before the next rise of the river commenced. The Nile may\r\nhave flowed at a lower level then (that is, in very early prehistoric\r\ntimes) than now, the summer volume was probably greater then than now,\r\nas the unbreached barriers in the upper reaches would have ponded\r\nup the water into reservoirs, which, slowly emptying themselves,\r\nwould have helped to raise the summer level; the flow-out also from\r\nthe Fayûm Lake would have raised at its exit the level of the summer\r\nNile, at least during the winter months, but not necessarily during\r\nthe summer months, as it may have expended itself sooner. There are\r\nthus three unknown elements in the problem, and nothing to witness\r\nto the former _minimum_ levels in the same way that the Nile deposit\r\ndoes to the maximum levels. We are therefore forced to base the\r\ncalculations on existing levels, and to suppose that the effect on\r\nthe water surface of the former lower level of the Nile bed was\r\ncounterbalanced by the increased volume of water flowing in the\r\nriver bed. At any rate at some period sooner or later the present\r\nminimum level of the Nile must have been reached.\r\n\r\nThe probability is that the exit channel of the lake joined the\r\nNile at or near Wâstah. Up to the end of April the rate of fall\r\nof the river exceeds the rate at which evaporation would lower\r\na lake surface, but in May the river falls about 15 centimetres,\r\nand not at all on an average in June. Hence, up to the end of April\r\nthe fall of the river would determine the rate of fall of the lake,\r\nbut in May and June the fall due to evaporation would rule the rate.\r\n\r\n                                                                    R.L.\r\n\r\n  The level of the Nile at Wâstah at the end of April\r\n   may be taken to be                                              18·75\r\n\r\n    The distance from Wâstah to Lahûn is            30  kilometres.\r\n\r\n           „          Lahûn to Hawârah              15      „\r\n                                                    --\r\n                           Total                    45      „\r\n\r\n  Allowing a water surface slope for the outflow of ¹⁄₂₅₀₀₀,\r\n   the difference in water surface level between the lake at\r\n   Hawârah and the Nile at Wâstah would be                          1·80\r\n                                                                   -----\r\n  Hence the water surface of the lake at the end of April\r\n   would be at                                                     20·55\r\n\r\n  Evaporation would still further lower\r\n   the surface in May by                                ·25\r\n\r\n     „    „    „              June  „                   ·30\r\n                                                        ---\r\n                                                                    0·55\r\n                                                                   -----\r\n  The water surface in the lake would thus become                  20·00\r\n\r\n  Probably the commencement of the flow into the lake would\r\n   not take place till a few days after the middle of July,\r\n   which may be taken as the time when the lake reaches its\r\n   lowest level for the year. Evaporation for this period of\r\n   July must therefore also be allowed for, say                     0·20\r\n                                                                   -----\r\n  The lowest level of the lake would therefore be                  19·80\r\n\r\nThe mean surface area of the Lake Fayûm between R.L. 19·80 and\r\n25·00 may be taken as 2000 million square metres.\r\n\r\nEvaporation during the ninety days of flood would tend to lower the\r\nlevel 70 centimetres.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water required to raise the lake from R.L. 19·80\r\nto 25·00 would therefore be 2,000,000,000 × (5·20 + 0·70) =\r\n11,800 million cubic metres, or a daily average for ninety days of\r\n131,111,111 cubic metres.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of these ninety days the inflow would be small,\r\nincreasing rapidly to the maximum; and again, as the lake level rose\r\nand the Nile began to fall in October, the inflow would gradually\r\ndecrease to nothing by the end of the ninety days. Hence it would\r\nprobably be necessary to suppose a maximum daily discharge into the\r\nlake of about 200 million cubic metres a day for part of the time.\r\n\r\n  --+-------+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+--\r\n    |   1   |     2      |      3       |      4      |      5      |\r\n    +-------+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n    |       | Number of  |              |             |             |\r\n    |       | Years out  |              |             |             |\r\n    |       |  of 16 in  |              |             |             |\r\n    |       | which the  |   Balance    |             |Corresponding|\r\n    |       |   Supply   |  available   |Corresponding|   Gauge,    |\r\n    | Date. |  given in  |    after     | Gauge, Beni |  Magnûnah   |\r\n    |       |   Col. 3   | allowing for |    Suef.    |  Mouth on   |\r\n    |       |  would be  | Lower Egypt. |             |    Nile.    |\r\n    |       | available  |              |             |             |\r\n    |       |    for     |              |             |             |\r\n    |       |abstraction.|              |             |             |\r\n    +-------+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n    |       |            |million cubic |   metres.   |   metres.   |\r\n    |       |            |  metres per  |             |             |\r\n    |       |            |     day.     |             |             |\r\n    |       |            |              |             |             |\r\n    |Sept. 1|     11     |  67 }        |    28·08    |    26·64    |\r\n    |       |            |     } Average|             |             |\r\n    | „   11|     11     | 108 }   112  |    28·11    |    26·67    |\r\n    |       |            |     }        |             |             |\r\n    | „   21|     11     | 162 }        |    28·14    |    26·70    |\r\n    |       |            |              |             |             |\r\n    |Oct.  1|     13     | 157 }        |    28·14    |    26·70    |\r\n    |       |            |     } Average|             |             |\r\n    | „   11|     12     | 174 }   192  |    28·15    |    26·71    |\r\n    |       |            |     }        |             |             |\r\n    | „   21|     14     | 245 }        |    28·12    |    26·68    |\r\n    |       |            |              |             |             |\r\n    |Nov.  1|     15     | 372          |    28·05    |    26·61    |\r\n    |       |            |              |             |             |\r\n    | „   11|     11     | 372          |    27·05    |    25·61    |\r\n    |       |            |              |             |             |\r\n    | „   21|     11     |  67          |    26·40    |    24·98    |\r\n    |       |            |              |             |             |\r\n    |Dec.  1|     12     |  63          |    25·88    |    24·40    |\r\n  --+-------+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+--\r\n\r\nColonel Western, in a note on the Wadi Raiân, shows that for a\r\ncertain number of years out of sixteen years (1872 to 1887, of which\r\nhe had the statistics to work with) there is a surplus discharge in\r\nthe Nile which might be abstracted without in any way interfering with\r\nthe ordinary irrigation of the Delta. In his calculations he takes 565\r\nmillion cubic metres in twenty-four hours as the discharge required\r\nby the Delta during September and the first half of October. He is,\r\nof course, referring to the conditions of the Delta at the present\r\ntime. He gives the table which appears on the preceding page, to\r\nwhich I have added the corresponding gauge levels at Beni Suef and\r\nMagnûnah mouth for reference further on.\r\n\r\nThe month of August has not been given, as the conclusion was come to\r\nthat there was no water to spare in August under present conditions.\r\n\r\nThe calculation, giving these figures, is made assuming that\r\nregulation on the Barrage below Cairo is not called in to assist;\r\nthe discharges allowed to Lower Egypt, after abstracting the above\r\nquantities, being sufficient to give a water surface at the level\r\nrequired for irrigation without any heading-up. Now, the quantity\r\nrequired to fill the lake to R.L. 25·00, as found before, is 11,800\r\nmillion cubic metres. This, let us suppose, would be made up thus:—\r\n\r\n  September              30 days at 112 millions = 3,360  millions.\r\n\r\n  October                31    „    192    „     = 5,952     „\r\n\r\n  Parts of August\r\n  and November           29    „     86    „     = 2,494     „\r\n                                                  ------\r\n                                     Total        11,806     „\r\n\r\nThese discharges could be abstracted without affecting Lower Egypt\r\nirrigation, as it exists now, for eleven years out of sixteen. This,\r\nhowever, is not a quite correct statement as applied to each of\r\nthe eleven years, since the discharges given in the table are\r\nthe _averages_ of those years in which a surplus discharge is\r\navailable. Among these would be some very high years, in which it\r\nwould be possible to fill the lake to a higher level than 25·00,\r\nand years when this level would not be reached.\r\n\r\nBesides the years, for which the averages of surplus discharges\r\nare taken, there would be five years out of sixteen when the supply\r\nwould fall short in September, the month of highest level.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity in this stage to seek for a connection between\r\nthe lake and the Nile for filling the lake, as the water would find\r\nits way in large volumes across all the low parts of the valley\r\ninto the drainage depression along the edge of the Libyan Desert,\r\nnow known as the Bahr Yûsuf.\r\n\r\nThe levels at which the Nile deposits are found in the Fayûm, the\r\ndischarges which might be drawn off from the Nile, and the area of\r\nthe Fayûm Lake are thus all in agreement with the supposition that\r\nthe level of the Fayûm lake was yearly raised from about R.L. 20·00\r\nto 25·00, and that the level attained was never sufficiently high\r\nto cause an overflow into the Wadi Raiân.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE FAYÛM AS LAKE MŒRIS.\r\n\r\nJudging then from the evidence furnished by Nile deposit and\r\nfresh-water shells, there is nothing to support the theory that there\r\nhas been any _great_ change in the Nile levels since the waters\r\nfirst found their way into the Fayûm. But whatever conditions of\r\nlevels and volumes of Nile discharges we start with, we must at\r\nsome date arrive at the period of present conditions. According to\r\nMr. Petrie, however, there is good evidence (which I will give later\r\non) to support the theory that in Herodotus’ time the Nile levels\r\nwere 2 metres lower than now, and it is further probable that, at\r\nthe time of the transformation of the Lake Fayûm into Lake Mœris,\r\nthe Nile volumes were what they are now. I shall, however, discuss\r\nthe subject, assuming that present conditions as to Nile levels also\r\nexisted at the formation of Lake Mœris, and point out afterwards\r\nhow the difference of 2 metres in the level at the time of Herodotus\r\naffects the conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe formation of Lake Mœris is credited to Amenemhat III. of the\r\nXIIth Dynasty, who gained a reputation for making great improvements\r\nin the Irrigation Department, and carrying out hydraulic works of\r\nimmense benefit to the country, about 2500 B.C., or within 5000\r\nyears of to-day. Now, 5000 years, geologically estimated, is a\r\nvery short time, and we may assume, without much chance of error,\r\nthat he had practically the same _general_ conditions to work with\r\nas regards _relative_ levels of land and water and Nile discharges\r\nas we have to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Fayûm Lake would, in his time, have filled and emptied itself,\r\nand low Niles would now and then have occurred. But even without the\r\noccurrence of a low Nile it would have been observed that during the\r\nsummer, when the surface of the lake in the Fayûm had reached its\r\nlowest level, there was a considerable area of land, formed of Nile\r\ndeposit, laid bare. A shining light among the king’s subjects may\r\nhave conceived a project for reclaiming this land from the annual\r\ninundation, submitted his project to the king and obtained his\r\napproval to its execution.\r\n\r\nThe problem would be that, while reclaiming the land, the advantages\r\nto be derived from a natural regulator to the Nile should not be\r\nlost. The return flow which took place from the lake would, while\r\nit was uncontrolled by artificial works, be greatest when there was\r\nleast benefit to be derived from a raising of the Nile water-surface;\r\nand least in the summer months, when an addition to the Nile discharge\r\nwould have been most needed. The effect of the uncontrolled early\r\nreturn-flow might even have acted disadvantageously in checking\r\nthe fall of the Nile level in December and the following winter\r\nmonths, and thereby delaying the draining of the lands which had\r\nbeen inundated by the preceding flood.\r\n\r\nNow, although the amount of water stored in the lake might, according\r\nto the project we are considering, become less in quantity than it\r\nwas before control was introduced, still by husbanding the water\r\ntill the season of low Nile, when an addition to the Nile was most\r\nrequired, the same benefits might be obtained from the reservoir\r\nduring the summer months as were felt when the lake acted under\r\nnature’s guidance only; and in addition to this, the flood water\r\nwould be more quickly drained off the inundated lands, and crops\r\nbe sown earlier, than would have been the case when the return-flow\r\nfrom the lake commenced with the fall of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe project would then consist of works for admitting water into the\r\nlake until it rose to a certain height and then excluding any more,\r\nwith the exception of about 10 to 15 million cubic metres a day,\r\nwhich would be required to make good the loss by evaporation over\r\nan area of about 1500 million square metres. The same work could be\r\nadapted to hold in the water on the fall of the river, and let it\r\nflow back when required; or this duty might be performed by a separate\r\nregulator. Some point between Lahûn and Hawârah would be chosen to\r\nmake a bank and regulator to bar the Bahr Yûsuf passage through the\r\nhills. Probably a convenient place was found near Hawârah pyramid,\r\nclose to which the Labyrinth was built.\r\n\r\nBy limiting the level of the lake to R.L. 22·50, all the area above\r\nthat level, which is that of the highest plateau in the Fayûm,\r\nwould be left uncovered, and fitted for cultivation and habitations.\r\n\r\nThe regulator established and the level of the water in the lake\r\nbeing thereby brought under control, it would be safe to commence\r\nthe occupation of the reclaimed land.\r\n\r\nAll this is speculation as to how the natural Fayûm Lake became\r\ntransformed into the artificially controlled Lake Mœris of\r\nHerodotus. There is little to base speculation upon, and therefore\r\nthe transformation process may be varied within certain limits at\r\nthe choice of the speculator.\r\n\r\nMr. Petrie’s views, already given at length, suggest a modification\r\nof the foregoing, which I will give as an alternative idea.\r\n\r\nThe natural drainage channel for carrying off the overflow of the\r\nNile, now the Bahr Yûsuf, being situate in the lowest lying lands,\r\nwould of necessity be kept clear by the annual discharge of the\r\nwaters from the inundated lands. On reaching the south end of the\r\nisolated piece of desert in front of Lahûn, part of its discharge\r\nwould go east of this island, part to the west. The western discharge\r\nwould, at Lahûn, either enter the Fayûm, or part would do so and\r\npart continue northwards. At the north end of the isolated piece of\r\ndesert, the discharge, going northwards, would again divide up, some\r\nof it continuing to flow in the channel under the Libyan Desert,\r\nsome finding its way back to the Nile near Wâstah. Under these\r\ncircumstances the channel north of Lahûn would not be so likely\r\nto keep itself clear as the channel to the south of Lahûn. Thus\r\nthe channel conducting the water to the Fayûm would remain clear,\r\nwhile that carrying the outflow would be less likely to do so. The\r\noutflow would also be more within soil (i.e. below the land surface)\r\nthan the inflow and therefore under worse conditions for keeping its\r\nchannel open. The outflow channel might therefore deteriorate, and,\r\nas there would be water flowing in it during the hot season at a low\r\nvelocity, reeds might grow and obstruct the water-way. The draining\r\nof the Fayûm Lake would therefore be unsatisfactorily done, and the\r\nwater would stand in it at a comparatively high level till the end\r\nof the summer. This would encourage the growth of rushes also in the\r\nLahûn-Hawârah passage, which would check the inflow, and, while\r\npreventing the rise of the lake, would favour silt deposit. “This\r\nthen,” in Mr. Petrie’s words, “was the state in which the great\r\nengineering monarchs found the province:—a basin full of overflow\r\nNile water, replenished at each inundation through a marshy shallow\r\ninlet and with much of its bottom so raised by deposits as to have\r\nbecome almost marsh ground, like the present lakes about the coast.”\r\n\r\nA channel to drain off the water at low Nile and reclaim the marshes\r\nwould have been the first work to suggest itself, and the necessity\r\nfor regulators, to prevent any excess of water from entering by the\r\ncleared channel, would then have been felt. The flow of water in the\r\ndrain leading back to the Nile may have suggested the grand idea of\r\nutilising the lake as a regulator for the excesses and shortcomings\r\nof the Nile.\r\n\r\nAmenemhat I., who was a sportsman, and prided himself on “hunting\r\nthe lion and bringing back the crocodile a prisoner,” may have\r\nchosen the point which projected farthest into the Lake (now\r\nMedinet-el-Fayûm and Kom-Faris) for the site of his palace and\r\ngarden. Here he would escape from the pestilential odours that he\r\nprobably kept about him in his original home, and at the same time\r\nenjoy the desert air, cooled by the immense surface of the lake,\r\non which he could indulge his taste for crocodile hunting. The\r\nnatural attractions which so rare a combination of desert air and\r\nopen space of water would afford, would probably, under the royal\r\nfavour, have made the new watering place and sanatorium a fashionable\r\nresort for the aristocracy, who would soon have built villas on the\r\nborders of the lake along the esplanade of Crocodilopolis, or Shed,\r\nas its first name appears to have been.\r\n\r\nThe modern Helouan, a dry treeless spot on the eastern desert a few\r\nmiles south of Cairo, found favour in the eyes of the late Khedive,\r\nTewfik Pasha, and became a sanatorium for the Cairenes, to whom a\r\ngood draught of pure desert air must be a real treat after living in\r\nthe tainted air of Egypt’s unsavoury capital. Helouan has sulphur\r\nsprings to boast of, but Crocodilopolis had a fine expanse of sweet\r\nwater to look out upon, instead of a dry, blinding and scorching\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nThe area above R.L. 22·50, at first reclaimed from the lake between\r\nLahûn and Medineh, would have been about 10,000 acres; and the king\r\nand his favourites would, according to nature, have taken possession\r\nof it. But there would have been an extensive shore of habitable\r\nground round the margins of the lake and on each side of the canal\r\nconnecting the lake with the Nile, which would be within reach of\r\na perpetual water supply and with the means of water transport at\r\nthe door almost of the habitations.\r\n\r\nWhen the attractions of Crocodilopolis and its suburbs became\r\nmore appreciated and the population increased, the want of a\r\nlarger area of cultivable land would be felt. There would also be\r\nanother inconvenience, besides scarcity of arable land, felt by\r\nthe dwellers in Crocodilopolis, arising from the yearly fall of\r\nthe water surface. At high water, when the lake was filled up to\r\nR.L. 22·50, embarkation and disembarkation from boats might take\r\nplace at Crocodilopolis itself, but, as the waters of the lake\r\nwere allowed to flow back to the Nile, and the water level fell to\r\nR.L. 20·00 or 19·50, there would be laid bare a muddy margin of 2\r\nkilometres breadth between the city and the water, which could with\r\ndifficulty be crossed, and if crossed, the depth of water along the\r\nedge of the lake would be found too shallow to allow boats to get\r\nclose to the land. One or both of these wants probably was the cause\r\nthat led to the construction of the bank from the high land, east of\r\nEdwah to Biahmu, and thence, it appears probable, to Medineh. (See\r\nPlate XX.) The bank from Edwah to Biahmu runs generally along\r\ncontour R.L. 17·50, and therefore would have been formed in water,\r\nprobably with material transported from the high lands on the east\r\nand south-east of Edwah. This may account for the material of which\r\nthe bank is formed being different from the land on either side of\r\nit, and for the absence of any trace of a borrow pit from which the\r\nbank was made. Such a bank, connected with the high land east of\r\nEdwah, running along contour R.L. 17·50 and joined from Biahmu to\r\nthe high land at Crocodilopolis, would have enclosed an area, from\r\nwhich the lake water would have been excluded, the other two sides of\r\nthe enclosure being formed by the natural ridge at the end of which\r\nCrocodilopolis was built, and by the high land connecting this ridge\r\nnear Hawârat-el-Maqta with the commencement of the artificial bank\r\nat Edwah. From the levels of the rock underlying the Nile deposit\r\nat Hawârah it seems probable that the entering waters flowed in\r\ngreatest volume past the Hawârah pyramid, separating the reclaimed\r\ntract from the desert on which the pyramid stands. Possibly this was\r\nthe only channel by which the waters were admitted to the lake, and\r\nacross which the regulator was built in the immediate neighbourhood\r\nof the Labyrinth and pyramid. The present course of the Bahr Yûsuf\r\nbeyond Hawârah may have been closed and the Medineh ridge connected\r\nwith the high desert on the left of the Bahr Yûsuf, near the modern\r\nhead of the Gharaq canal. At present it is so connected, and the\r\nconnection is only broken by artificial canals cut through it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX.\r\n\r\nDIAGRAM SHOWING THE LIMITS OF LAKE MŒRIS ACCORDING TO THE THEORY\r\nFAVOURED IN THIS PAPER.\r\n\r\n_Note._—The contours along the N.W. side of the lake are not\r\naccurately shown as this side has not been surveyed.\r\n\r\nOutside the contour of R.L. 25·00 the dotted surface represents\r\nuncultivated desert. Within the contour of R.L. 21·00 the area\r\ncrossed by parallel lines represents the water-surface of Lake Mœris.\r\n\r\nThe unshaded and undotted area represents the cultivable land in\r\nand around Lake Mœris.]\r\n\r\nThus would the second reclamation have been contrived, and it would\r\nhave added about 7000 feddans of good land to the 10,000 feddans\r\nincluded in the first reclamation.\r\n\r\nThe Edwah bank, however, does not stop at Biahmu, but (a fact Linant\r\ndid not remark) continues in its first alignment to Kalabiîn, past\r\nSaliîn and Fidimîn, to a point a little to the north of Sinrû. (See\r\nPlate XXI.) Thence it curves round towards the south, and crosses the\r\nAbûksah Railway at a point half-way between Agamiîn and Abshiwâî\r\n(Abû Ginshû). At this crossing are extensive remains of an old\r\ntown on the line of the bank. The remains of several smaller towns\r\nare also to be found between the railway and the point in the bank\r\nnorth of Sinrû, all on the line of the bank. From this length of\r\nbank other banks at different angles to the main bank seem to have\r\nexisted; some appeared to go towards Medineh, others towards Abûksah\r\nin the direction of Lake Qurûn.\r\n\r\nFollowing the main bank on the other side of the railway along\r\ncontour R.L. 17·50 or thereabouts, a ravine is crossed, on the far\r\nedge of which, in the line of the bank, is a peculiar black mound,\r\nformed of layers of cinders or some material that has been blackened\r\nby fire. The bank is thence traceable for about a thousand metres\r\nmore, continuing in a due southerly direction, and then it is lost\r\namong the thick plantations of date-trees which commence at this\r\npoint and extend to Tobhâr.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI.\r\n\r\n_Stanford’s Geogl. Estabt. London_\r\n\r\nMAP TO SHOW POSITION OF SUPPOSED REGULATORS OF LAKE MŒRIS.]\r\n\r\nDoes it double back to Medineh through Talat and Sinbat; or continue\r\nalong its contour through Tobhâr, Manâshi, Disyâ, Abgig, and to\r\nthe desert near Azab? (See Map at end.) There were found no traces\r\nto show. A further examination of the ground on both sides of the\r\nAbûksah Railway has thrown no light on the matter. It would appear\r\nthat the traces of the bank end somewhere in the triangle formed by\r\njoining the villages of Abû Ginshû, Agamiîn, and Sinrû.\r\n\r\nI thought it might be possible that, either from near Sinrû or west\r\nof Agamiîn, the bank was carried up the slope, at right angles to\r\nthe contours, to Medineh to close the side of the new area to be\r\nreclaimed, but I looked for its traces in vain. But, _supposing_\r\nthe existence of this side-bank, the new area, enclosed by the bank\r\njoining Medineh, Sinrû (or Agamiîn), and Biahmu, and bounded also by\r\nthe former bank from Biahmu to Medineh, would add about 10,000 feddans\r\nto that already reclaimed, bringing up the total to 27,000 feddans.\r\n\r\nThe want of a larger cultivable area would thus by these reclamations\r\nbe partly met.\r\n\r\nNow, as the artificial bank was formed along contour R.L. 17·50\r\n(under the conditions assumed), and the water of the lake, as will be\r\nshown afterwards, never fell below R.L. 19·50, there would at lowest\r\nwater be 2 metres depth of water up against the bank, and the most\r\nconvenient point of embarkation and disembarkation for the inhabitants\r\nof Crocodilopolis on their way to Memphis would be at Biahmu, which\r\nthey would reach by the road running along the top of the artificial\r\nbank formed between Crocodilopolis and Biahmu. They would take ship\r\nat Biahmu for the north-east corner of the lake, whence the desert\r\nroute runs direct to Memphis. This is the direct road used to-day\r\nby the natives, who journey between Medineh (Crocodilopolis) and\r\nBedreshên (Memphis), the road passing through Tamîyah, the site\r\nof which was, at the time that we are considering, 30 metres below\r\nwater. (See Map at end.) It was therefore strictly correct to say\r\nthat Lake Mœris lay between the Memphite and Arsinoïte Nomes.\r\n\r\nThe ruins at Biahmu, of which Plate XXII. shows the present condition,\r\nare not in the line of the main bank from Edwah to Kalabiîn, but\r\nabout 300 metres to the north of it. It is probable, therefore, that\r\nthey were placed at the end of a projecting bank, in connection with\r\nthe main bank, alongside which boats could lie. The two colossal\r\nfigures (Plate XXIV.) mounted on their pedestals would have formed\r\nsplendid landmarks for ships crossing from the north shore of\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXII.\r\n\r\nBIAHMU RUINS.]\r\n\r\nThus we have a vast lake of about 1600 million square metres of\r\nwater surface, and an area of 27,000 feddans (acres) reclaimed from\r\nit, with Crocodilopolis in the reclaimed area, and the Hawârah\r\npyramid and the Labyrinth on the shores of the lake at the point\r\nwhere the waters entering the lake were controlled. (Plates XX. and\r\nXXI.) This, I believe, was the Lake Mœris of Herodotus and of those\r\nwho confirmed his testimony, and Mr. Petrie, as I have shown before,\r\nholds the same general views.\r\n\r\nBut his theory, that the two pyramids, which Herodotus stated stood\r\nabout the middle of the lake, were identical with the two colossi\r\nof Biahmu, of which the present ruins are all that is left, does not\r\nappear to me a satisfactory explanation of the account of them given\r\nby Herodotus, though to what Herodotus said he was _told_ I think\r\nno importance need be attached, as statements in a foreign language\r\nare apt to be misunderstood or misinterpreted. Arab traditions also\r\nmay be curious and interesting, but they are of little value as a\r\nrecord of the past.\r\n\r\nIt will be worth while to calculate the inflow and outflow of the lake\r\nin the condition, in which I have supposed it to be, as Lake Mœris,\r\nand to see if the existing features of the Nile Valley throw any light\r\non the statements of the first historical witnesses to its existence.\r\n\r\nIn my former calculations of the volumes of water required to fill\r\nthe Fayûm depression to higher levels, I have taken the area of the\r\ndepression at 2000 million square metres. But our mean water level\r\nis now R.L. 21·00, and the area of the lake will be reduced.\r\n\r\n  The present taxed area in the Fayûm\r\n  is nearly                                       234,000 feddans.[8]\r\n                                                  -------\r\n  The actual cultivated area is more\r\n  probably about                                  280,000    „\r\n\r\n  The area of the Birket-el-Qurûn is\r\n  about                                            70,000    „\r\n                                                  -------\r\n                               Total              350,000    „\r\n\r\n  350,000 feddans                         = 1,470,000,000 square metres.\r\n\r\n  Add the uncultivated area below\r\n  R.L. 21·00                              =   300,000,000\r\n                                            -------------\r\n                               Total        1,770,000,000\r\n\r\n  Deduct areas reclaimed from\r\n  Lake Mœris:—\r\n\r\n    1st reclamation    40,000,000\r\n\r\n    2nd     „          24,000,000\r\n\r\n    3rd     „          40,000,000\r\n\r\n                       ----------             104,000,000\r\n                                            -------------\r\n  Remaining for area of Lake Mœris          1,666,000,000\r\n\r\n                                    or, say, 1600 million square metres.\r\n\r\nNow let us suppose that the exit channel joins the Nile at the\r\npoint where Kosheshah Escape has been built, a little above Wâstah\r\n(Plate XXI.)\r\n\r\nThe lowest summer levels at Wâstah were in 1887, 18·82; 1888,\r\n18·12; 1889, 18·26.\r\n\r\nLet us then call the mean L.W.L. of Wâstah 18·50.\r\n\r\nAs the exit channel would be of considerable dimensions, we may suppose\r\na water-surface slope, at the _final_ date of outflow, of ¹⁄₅₀₀₀₀. The\r\ndistance from Wâstah to Lahûn is 25 kilometres, and from Lahûn to\r\nHawârah 10 kilometres; total 35 kilometres. The fall in this distance\r\nwould then be 0·70, which would make the level at Hawârah, or the level\r\nof the lake (18·50 + 0·70 =) 19·20. But the outflow, even at the date of\r\nthe lowest level of the Nile, before the rise commenced, may be assumed\r\nto have raised the Nile 30 centimetres, which would make the lowest\r\nlevel of the lake R.L. 19·50.\r\n\r\nThe water surface of Lake Mœris would therefore oscillate between the\r\nlevel of 22·50, beyond which the regulator would be used to prevent\r\nits rising, and R.L. 19·50, below which it could not fall on account\r\nof the level which the Nile maintains at its point of union with it.\r\n\r\nOn the map of Linant Pasha’s, published in 1854, before the\r\nrailway and Ibrahimîyah Canal were made, the channels in the\r\nNile Valley shown in connection with the Lahûn entrance are the\r\nBahr Yûsuf, coming from the south, and the Magnûnah Canal going\r\nnorth. The latter, after going north for 13 kilometres, is joined by\r\nthree channels, the first taking off from the Nile at Beni Suef,\r\nand the second and third a little south of Ashment. The third\r\nis the old Magnûnah. These channels unite in the neighbourhood\r\nof Abûsir-el-Malaq, the second passing by the village of Bûsh,\r\nthe immense heap, on which the modern village stands, witnessing\r\nto the existence of an ancient town on that spot. Abûsir-el-Malaq\r\nalso was evidently in the far past a place of importance. North\r\nof Abûsir-el-Malaq the channel of the Magnûnah is continued as\r\na single channel along the west desert for 4 or 5 kilometres when\r\nit bifurcates, one branch continuing under the western desert, and\r\nthe second going east to join the Nile at the point where Kosheshah\r\nEscape now stands. Some of these channels are shown on Plate XXI.\r\n\r\nHaving evidence of no other channels, let us suppose that the\r\nMagnûnah Canal with its mouth near Ashment was the feeder, the\r\nbranch to Kosheshah Escape the exit channel, and the eastern branch\r\nunder the western desert a canal of supply to Memphis. (The Bahr\r\nYûsuf I do not consider as in those times a channel in _direct_\r\ncommunication with the Nile.)\r\n\r\nWith R.L. 22·50 and 19·50 as the maximum and minimum levels of Lake\r\nMœris, there would, under these circumstances and unless prevented\r\nby the use of a regulator, have been a flow into the lake from about\r\nthe 15th July to the 15th January, and a return flow from the 15th\r\nJanuary to the 15th July.\r\n\r\nThe levels of the Nile and lake would have been approximately as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n                                                                  R.L.\r\n\r\n                         {  Lake                                  19·50\r\n  Lowest water levels,   {\r\n   when lake ceases to   {  Junction at Abûsir-el-Malaq           19·40\r\n   flow out and the      {\r\n   flow-in is about to   {  Magnûnah Nile mouth at Ashment        20·00\r\n   commence.             {\r\n                         {  Outlet into Nile at Kosheshah Escape  19·00\r\n\r\n                         {  Lake                                  22·50\r\n  Water levels on 15th   {\r\n   January, when flow-in {  Abûsir-el-Malaq                       22·00\r\n   would cease and lake  {\r\n   return-flow would     {  Magnûnah mouth                        23·00\r\n   commence.             {\r\n                         {  Outlet, Kosheshah                     21·00\r\n\r\n                         {  Lake                         21·50 to 22·50\r\n                         {\r\n  Ordinary flood maximum {  Abûsir-el-Malaq              25·30 to 27·40\r\n   levels at end of      {\r\n   September.            {  Magnûnah mouth               26·00 to 28·00\r\n                         {\r\n                         {  Outlet, Kosheshah            24·80 to 27·00\r\n\r\nThe year 1888 was one of very low Nile flood, but even in that year,\r\nfrom about 20th July to 15th November, the Nile level at Magnûnah\r\nmouth was above R.L. 23·00, and reached R.L. 26·00 at the top of\r\nthe flood.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water required to fill the lake from R.L. 19·50 to\r\n22·50, and to allow for its evaporation for six months, is calculated\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n                                                           Million cubic\r\n                                                              metres.\r\n\r\n  Volume required to raise lake 3 metres = 1600 million\r\n  square metres × 3                                            4800\r\n\r\n  Volume required to make good 6 months’ evaporation\r\n  = 1600 million square metres × 1·30                          2080\r\n\r\n  Volume required for irrigation of 25,000 feddans\r\n  reclaimed, for 6 months                                       100\r\n                                                               ----\r\n                                 Total volume required         7580\r\n\r\nThe greater part of this would be poured in during the three months\r\nof flood, say 5000 million cubic metres in 100 days, or an average\r\nof 50 million cubic metres a day.\r\n\r\nThere now remains to be calculated the discharge that this reservoir\r\nwould give back to the Nile during the low water months.\r\n\r\n                                                           Million cubic\r\n                                                              metres.\r\n\r\n  The content of the stratum of water between R.L. 22·50\r\n  and 19·50 is 1600 million square metres × 3                  4800\r\n\r\n  Of this there would be lost by evaporation during the\r\n  6 months 1600 million square metres × 1                      1600\r\n                                                               ----\r\n  There would thus remain available for purposes of\r\n  irrigation                                                   3200\r\n\r\n  The reclaimed land round Arsinoë (about 25,000 feddans)\r\n  would require about 50 million cubic metres for its\r\n  irrigation during the 6 months of winter and summer            50\r\n                                                               ----\r\n  The balance available for the Nile Valley would be           3150\r\n\r\nIf we suppose this water husbanded and made use of only during the\r\n100 days of summer, when its want is most felt, the lake would give\r\nan average daily discharge to the Nile of 31½ million cubic metres,\r\nthat is, the low Nile discharges would be doubled and raised from\r\n30 millions to 60 millions. But by a careful distribution of this\r\nstored-up water between the months of April, May, and June, and ten\r\ndays of July, it would have been possible to keep up the discharges\r\nconstantly to seventy millions, as shown in the table below:—\r\n\r\n  --+-----------+-------------------+-------------+----------------+--\r\n    |           |   Average Nile    | Supplied by |Total Increased |\r\n    |  Month.   |Discharge, without | reservoir.  |   Discharge.   |\r\n    |           |    reservoir.     |             |                |\r\n    +-----------+-------------------+-------------+----------------+\r\n    |March      |    70,000,000     |     Nil     |   70,000,000   |\r\n    |           |                   |             |                |\r\n    |April      |    45,000,000     | 25,000,000  |   70,000,000   |\r\n    |           |                   |             |                |\r\n    |May        |    34,000,000     | 36,000,000  |   70,000,000   |\r\n    |           |                   |             |                |\r\n    |June       |    34,000,000     | 36,000,000  |   70,000,000   |\r\n    |           |                   |             |                |\r\n    |July 1 to 8|    45,000,000     | 25,000,000  |   70,000,000   |\r\n  --+-----------+-------------------+-------------+----------------+--\r\n\r\nThe supply from the reservoir will thus be\r\n\r\n(36 million × 61 days) + (25 million × 38 days) = 3146 million\r\ncubic metres.\r\n\r\nSuch an increase of the summer supply would probably have the effect\r\nof doubling the area under summer crops in the Delta, if it could be\r\nobtained now, but it is not clear how it could have been utilised\r\nwithout a barrage to raise the water-level, and without, as far as\r\nwe know, any Sêfi (summer) canals.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, imagined that in the days of Lake Mœris there\r\nwas any such scientifically economical control of the Nile waters,\r\nas supposed in the foregoing calculations, but they are given to show\r\nwhat the _possibilities_ of a lake under the conditions assumed would\r\nbe. My aim has been to establish its utility, in answer to Linant’s\r\nargument against the developed Lake Qurûn theory, which consisted in\r\na demonstration that this lake could have served no useful purpose,\r\nsuch as the historians credited it with.\r\n\r\nPossibly the needs of navigation were a more important consideration\r\nin those days than summer irrigation, though not given the first\r\nplace now. An increased volume supplied at low water to the shallowing\r\nwater-routes would even for this object have been a gain.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of all trace of the regulators is felt by some\r\nto be a difficulty in the way of the admission of their former\r\nexistence, inasmuch as the ancients built on such a colossal\r\nscale. But the Labyrinth, which was built out of the reach of water,\r\nhas disappeared, and its traces were only of late years identified\r\nin a mass of stone chips and trenches filled with sand, which\r\nunderlay the foundations. Such being the fate of the Labyrinth,\r\nwhich must have surpassed the regulators as a structure of colossal\r\ndimensions, it is only natural to suppose that the stones forming\r\nthe superstructure of the regulators should also have been removed\r\nfor the same objects as the stones of the Labyrinth, and, if the\r\nmaterials of the floors were spared, it would only be on account of\r\ntheir situation being unfavourable to their removal. But, if spared,\r\nthe action of running water would in time cause their disappearance,\r\neither by undermining them and burying them to depths below their\r\noriginal position, or by depositing a layer of mud above them. In\r\nthe latter case they may still exist in a situation where some future\r\nexcavation may chance to bring them to light again.\r\n\r\nHence I hold that, in the face of Strabo’s explicit statement that\r\nthere were regulators at each end of the canal for controlling the\r\ninflow and outflow of the lake, the objection of want of evidence of\r\nthe former existence of regulators is not sufficiently strong to be\r\nallowed to have much weight against the theory, that the submerged\r\nFayûm, with the entry and exit of its waters kept under control\r\nby regulators, and its water-levels ranging between R.L. 22·50\r\nand 19·50, was the Lake Mœris of Herodotus; the Arsinoïte Nome,\r\nin connection with it, consisting of the reclaimed high lands within\r\nthe limits of the lake and along the borders of the lake itself and\r\nmargins of the feeder canal. It is admitted, as a weak point in this\r\ntheory, that unless the Arsinoïte Nome can be imagined as extending\r\ninto the Nile Valley, the area of cultivable land comprised in the\r\nnome is very limited. Let us see how far such a conception of Lake\r\nMœris is in accord with the testimony of the ancient records which\r\nrelate to it.\r\n\r\nStrabo remarks, that “the Lake Mœris, by its magnitude and depth,\r\nis able to receive the superabundance of water which flows into\r\nit at the time of the rise of the river, without overflowing the\r\ninhabited and cultivated parts of the province.” This could not be\r\nmade to accord with M. Linant’s theory, and can only be understood\r\nby supposing that the _high_ lands in the Fayûm were reclaimed, and\r\nthat the flood waters filled the rest of the Fayûm without rising\r\nso high as to inundate them. At the same time the area of the lake\r\nmust have been great to fit it, under this limitation, to receive\r\na sufficient volume to moderate the Nile floods and to be able to\r\nreturn to the Nile a sufficiently large supply to supplement the low\r\nNile discharge in an efficient manner. The figures representing the\r\npossible performances of the lake have been given.\r\n\r\nDiodorus also says, “Accordingly the king dug a canal from the\r\nNile to the basin 10 miles in length and 300 feet in breadth.” This\r\nwould seem to show that the canal took off from the Nile immediately\r\nopposite Lahûn, for, if its mouth had been carried further south\r\nup the Nile, its length would have exceeded 10 miles. The breadth\r\nof 300 feet equals 91½ metres. This also agrees with the size of\r\nthe inflow and outflow canals which would have been necessary to\r\ndischarge the calculated volumes.\r\n\r\nA canal with bed width 90 metres, depth 8 metres, and water surface\r\nslope ¹⁄₂₀₀₀₀, will discharge about 69½ million cubic metres per 24\r\nhours, which agrees with the calculation for the inflow.\r\n\r\nA canal with bed width of 90 metres, depth 6½ metres, and water surface\r\nslope of ¹⁄₂₅₀₀₀, would discharge 34 million cubic metres per 24\r\nhours, which agrees with the calculations for the outflow.\r\n\r\nDiodorus remarks also that “a little south of Memphis a canal was\r\ncut for a lake, brought down in length from the city 40 miles.”\r\nThis is somewhat obscure, but may mean that a canal 40 miles in\r\nlength was dug to connect Memphis with the lake. Supposing the canal\r\nthat fed the lake from the Nile passed Abûsir-el-Malaq as already\r\ndescribed, the canal to connect the lake and Memphis would have\r\ntaken off from the feeder canal at or near Abûsir-el-Malaq. The\r\ndistance from that point to the modern Bedreshên, the station at\r\nwhich tourists alight for viewing the ruins of Memphis, is 47 miles,\r\nand it is quite possible that what was known as Memphis extended\r\nseveral miles to the south, and that the canal was only 40 miles in\r\nlength between Abûsir-el-Malaq and Memphis.\r\n\r\nHerodotus states that the lake is six months filling and six months\r\nemptying. With the surface level of the lake limited to R.L. 22·50,\r\nand with the mouth of the feeder canal near Ashment and the outflow\r\nat Kosheshah Escape, such would be the case, for though the lake\r\nmight be filled during the months of flood to R.L. 22·50, there\r\nwould still be a flow into the lake for the remainder of the six\r\nmonths to meet loss by evaporation.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of the Lake Mœris would stand the Labyrinth with\r\nits pyramid (Hawârah), and within the lake area Crocodilopolis or\r\nArsinoë (Medinet-el-Fayûm). The lake would serve as a moderator for\r\nthe Nile in flood, and would supplement the short supply of the river\r\nin summer. It would have had a perimeter of 220 kilometres against\r\nHerodotus’ perimeter of 360 kilometres, assuming that Jomard and\r\nothers were right in supposing that Herodotus made use of the little\r\nstadius. The greatest depth of the lake, when filled to R.L. 22·50,\r\nwould have been at least 70 metres against Herodotus’ depth of\r\n92 metres.\r\n\r\nThe lake itself was not artificially made, as supposed by Herodotus,\r\nbut was brought under control by the works of man.\r\n\r\nThe water in the lake came from the Nile and not from local sources.\r\n\r\nThe lake lay between the Arsinoïte and Memphite Nomes.\r\n\r\nHerodotus and others after him state that there existed two pyramids,\r\ncrowned by colossal statues, centrally situated in the lake, and\r\nHerodotus thus describes them:—“The lake lies oblong north and\r\nsouth, being, in its deepest part, 50 fathoms deep. It tells its\r\nown story that it is artificially made, for about the middle of the\r\nlake stand two pyramids, each rising above the surface of the water\r\n50 fathoms, and that part of them which is built under water being\r\nas much more. On the top of each (or _against_ each, according to\r\nCope Whitehouse’s translating) is a colossal figure seated on a\r\nthrone. So these pyramids are 100 fathoms high.”\r\n\r\nIt is supposed by some that the ruins at Biahmu (Plate XXII.) are\r\nthe remains of what Herodotus described as pyramids. Possibly they\r\nare, but it seems a somewhat feebly supported supposition. Though a\r\ncolossus on the top of a pyramid is not what one would expect to find\r\nthere, and the dimensions of the pyramids given by Herodotus are, of\r\ncourse, obtained second-hand and may be worthy of little reliance,\r\nstill the evidence, that the Biahmu ruins are the remains of what\r\nhe referred to, does not seem to me convincing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII.\r\n\r\nRESTORATION OF A COLOSSUS, BIAHMU, FAYÛM.\r\n\r\nReproduced from Petrie’s ‘Hawara, Biahmu, and Arsinoë.’]\r\n\r\nMr. Flinders Petrie considers that these ruins are the remains of\r\nwhat was once a place of embarkation and disembarkation on the lake,\r\nconsisting of a flight of steps, flanked by two colossi raised\r\non high pedestals. In one of his publications he has pictorially\r\nreproduced these colossi, their pedestals and enclosure walls, in a\r\nmost complete manner (Plate XXIII.), his only personal acquaintance\r\nwith the figures consisting of a broken nose and fragments of stone\r\ndrapery, discovered among the débris of their ruins. To one of the\r\nuninitiated, even after studying the evidence adduced by Mr. Petrie,\r\nthere appears to be a great deal of esoteric ingenuity or imagination\r\nin the process of reproduction, but one or the other of these gifts\r\nis a necessity in dealing with anything Egyptological on account of\r\nthe incompleteness of the historical records. Plate XXIII. gives a\r\nreproduction of Mr. Petrie’s restoration, and Plate XXII. is from\r\na photograph of the ruins as they exist now. The reduced levels have\r\nbeen added by me.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Petrie’s restoration he has shown the worshipper down below,\r\nstanding on the general country level. My idea is that the interior\r\nof the courtyard was filled up to the level of the surrounding wall\r\nand formed a landing-place, as I have indicated in Plate XXIV. by\r\nthe upper figure and the boats. If the water stood up against the\r\ncourtyard wall, as I have shown, since there is no mortar in the\r\njoints of the masonry, the man below (as shown in Mr. Petrie’s\r\nunmodified representation) would have been drowned out.\r\n\r\nThis landing-place was probably connected at the back by a bank with\r\nthe main bank running through Biahmu.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears that some say that the lake waters flowed into and out of\r\nthe lake by one and the same channel, and that others say there were\r\ntwo canals, one for the inflow and another for the outflow. These two\r\naccounts may be reconciled by supposing that the former referred to\r\nthe canal south of Abûsir-el-Malaq, which is a single canal, Plate\r\nXXI., and that the latter referred to the channels, one of which was\r\nfor the inflow from the Nile near Ashment, to Abûsir-el-Malaq, and\r\nthe other for the outflow from Abûsir-el-Malaq to Memphis or perhaps\r\nto the point on the Nile where Kosheshah Escape stands. Strabo is\r\nobscure on this point. He writes:—“Then follows the Heracleöte\r\nNome, in a large island, near which is the canal on the right hand,\r\nwhich leads into Libya, in the direction of the Arsinoïte Nome;\r\nso that the canal has two entrances, a part of the island on one\r\nside being interposed between them.” Possibly this refers to\r\nthe isolated bit of desert in front of and to the east of Lahûn,\r\nwhich is “a part of the island” interposed between the Bahr\r\nYûsuf coming from the south and passing to Lahûn on the left of\r\nthe island, and the Magnûnah canal or special lake-feeder, which\r\npasses on the right of the island, turns south towards Lahûn and\r\nleads into Libya in the direction of the Arsinoïte Nome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV.\r\n\r\nMODIFIED REPRESENTATION OF THE BIAHMU RUINS RESTORED.]\r\n\r\nI have consulted Smith’s ‘Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography,’ to\r\nfind out what the editor considered to be the accepted views about Lake\r\nMœris in 1868. Under “Mœris Lacus” I find that the views stated agree in\r\nthe main with those favoured in this paper. Linant’s theory is not\r\nreferred to, and probably had not been heard of by the editor. The\r\nfollowing passage about the connecting canal occurs in the Dictionary,\r\nwhich can hardly be made to refer to the Bahr Yûsuf as the main\r\nlake-feeder, though assumed to do so in the passage itself:—“There are\r\ngrounds for supposing that ancient travellers did not always distinguish\r\nbetween the connecting canal, the Bahr Yûsuf, and Mœris itself. The\r\ncanal was unquestionably constructed by man’s labour, nor would\r\nit present any insuperable difficulties to a people so laborious as\r\nthe Egyptians. If, then, we distinguished, as Strabo did, the canal\r\nfrom the lake, the ancient narratives may be easily reconciled with\r\none another and with modern surveys. Even the words of Herodotus\r\nmay apply to the canal, which was of considerable extent, beginning\r\nat Hermopolis (Ashmunîn) and running four leagues west, and then\r\nturning from north to south for three leagues more, until it reaches\r\nthe lake.”\r\n\r\nNow the old Magnûnah Canal, with its mouth on the river near Ashment,\r\ngoes west for a little over three leagues to Abûsir-el-Malaq, and\r\nthen turns _from north to south_ for three leagues till it reaches\r\nLahûn. (Plate XXI.) As it is a remarkable thing to find a canal in\r\nthe Nile Valley which runs from north to south, the near agreement\r\nof these figures and directions is a remarkable coincidence, if it\r\nis nothing more.\r\n\r\nThere is another coincidence which may well be accidental, but is\r\nworth noticing. Arab tradition is, I believe, the authority for\r\nplacing the mouth of the connecting canal at Ashmunîn. “Joseph\r\ncollected workmen and dug the canal of Menhi from Ashmunîn to\r\nel-Lahûn.”\r\n\r\nNow the mouth of the old Magnûnah Canal, which I have been supposing\r\nmay have been the canal of inflow, had one of its mouths near\r\n“Ashment.” Can a misprint have been responsible for “Ashment”\r\nbeing changed into “Ashmunîn,” or may it not have been changed\r\nduring the process of handing down the tradition orally, the name of\r\nthe larger town Ashmunîn being substituted when the lesser Ashment\r\nlost its importance and its notoriety after Lake Mœris ceased to be?\r\n\r\n\r\nBut all these speculations must be modified, _but not more than\r\nmodified_, if what follows is a more correct view of the conditions\r\nof the Nile at the time of Herodotus.\r\n\r\nHitherto I have assumed that the levels of maximum and minimum Nile\r\nwere the same in his time as they are now.\r\n\r\nBut it is supposed that the Nile levels at that time were about\r\n2 metres lower than they are now, and it is necessary to consider\r\nin what way such a change of conditions would modify the views of\r\nwhat Lake Mœris was and did, as given in the foregoing arguments\r\nand calculations.\r\n\r\nThe supposition, or certainty, that the Nile in the time of Herodotus\r\nwas about 2 metres lower in level than it is now, is based on the\r\nfollowing observations, which Mr. Petrie has given me. He estimates\r\nthat the rate of rise has been about 4 inches a century. This, he\r\nstates, is shown by a Roman wall at Tanis and by the town-level of\r\nNaukratis, both old towns in Lower Egypt. The old tombs at Memphis\r\nare now under water. At Edfu the High Nile rises shoulder high on\r\nthe walls, which shows a rise of 4 inches or more per century. At\r\nAswân (Assouan) the records of High Niles on the Roman Nilometer\r\nshow that they were lower than now by an amount calculated at a rate\r\nof 4 inches per century.\r\n\r\nThere is also, Mr. Petrie adds, other evidence of the same sort,\r\nbut less definite, giving the same general result.\r\n\r\nIf now we suppose the Fayûm (Lake Mœris) filled to R.L. 20·50\r\nand emptied to R.L. 17·50, there is nothing to be changed in the\r\ncalculations, except the maximum and minimum surface levels of\r\nthe lake. Thus there would be a rather, but not much, larger area\r\nreclaimed and the Edwah-Biahmu bank would have been formed along\r\nthe edge of the lake at lowest water, instead of in two metres of\r\nwater. This modified view of its formation would seem to be more\r\nprobable than that which supposed it to have been formed in water.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we suppose the lake still filled to R.L. 22·50\r\nas a maximum, while its lowest level reached R.L. 17·50, the\r\ndischarges found to have been necessary to fill the lake (under the\r\nconditions previously assumed excepting as regards minimum level),\r\nmust be increased by 50 per cent., and the figures representing the\r\nreturn-flow be doubled.\r\n\r\nIn all probability the maximum level of the lake was somewhere\r\nbetween R.L. 22·50 and 20·50, and may be taken as varying from\r\nR.L. 22·00 to 21·00.\r\n\r\nThe lake may have been chiefly filled by the Bahr Yûsuf and the flood\r\nwaters inundating the Nile Valley, but, to fulfil the conditions of\r\na six months’ flow-in and six months flow-out of the lake, under\r\nthe new conditions supposed, and retaining a maximum lake-level of\r\nR.L. 22·50, the canal of supply would have to have its off-take\r\nfrom the Nile moved to a point about half-way between Beni Suef and\r\nBiba. Supposing the Bahr Yûsuf and the flood water of the Nile Valley\r\nfilled this lake during the flood months and the Bahr Yûsuf ceased\r\nto flow with the end of the flood, the canal from between Beni Suef\r\nand Biba would have had to supply only about 10 million cubic metres\r\na day to make good the loss by evaporation, if the lake-level was not\r\nto be allowed to fall below R.L. 22·50 till the return-flow to the\r\nNile was required. But there is no reason to suppose this to have\r\nbeen a necessity. With a lowest level of 17·50 instead of 19·50,\r\nthe problem of the lake as a relieving and supplementing reservoir\r\nto the Nile, with houses and cultivation above its highest levels,\r\nis much simplified, and a large margin is given between R.L. 20·50\r\nand 22·50 for increasing the volumes given in my former calculations,\r\nto render the lake a more efficient safety-valve for excessive floods,\r\nand for moderating the fall of the Nile to low discharges by giving\r\nback to it a more abundant outflow.\r\n\r\nAccepting this view of the range of the lake-levels, we shall have\r\nto look upon the Magnûnah Canal and its branches as channels of\r\nreturn-flow to the Nile for the commencement of the period of outflow,\r\nwhich would afterwards cease to carry any discharge in summer, when\r\nthe lake-level had fallen below about R.L. 19·00. For the remaining\r\nperiod of outflow the Kosheshah Escape branch from Abûsir-el-Malaq\r\nto the Nile and the branch to Memphis skirting the Libyan Hills,\r\nwould have carried all the discharge returning to the Nile Valley.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar isolated piece of Nile desert opposite Lahûn and the\r\ncultivated strip of land between it and the main desert, through\r\nwhich the Bahr Yûsuf flows into the Fayûm, seems to lend itself to\r\nthe regulation of the entry and exit of the Nile waters. To control\r\nthe entry of the waters a regulator A and cross bank _a b_ from the\r\nisland desert across the Bahr Yûsuf to the main desert on the west\r\ncould have been made. (See map, Plate XXI.)\r\n\r\nThe excess water, excluded from the lake by regulation on A, would\r\nhave found its way along the east of the patch of desert as it\r\ndoes to-day.\r\n\r\nTo retain and to control the exit of the water, a regulator B and\r\nits bank _c d_ might have been added, where shown on the map, or\r\nanywhere between B and the end of the narrow band of cultivation at\r\nC. There is, however, no evidence to show that such works did exist,\r\nbut Strabo’s statement, the presence of the Lahûn pyramid and\r\nthe situation of the villages Lahûn and Manshîyah make it perhaps\r\nprobable that there were some important works connected with the\r\nlake in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the peculiar alignment of the present bank _g_ D B _c_\r\nwhich closes the gap into the Fayûm, is difficult to imagine, as\r\nthe bank is at least three times the length it would have been, if it\r\nhad been formed in a direct line across the gap. But it has suggested\r\nitself to me, that the length B _c_ may be part of the original bank\r\n_d_ B _c_, that may have crossed from side to side of the valley of\r\nexit, and on which the villages of Lahûn and Manshîyah were built.\r\n\r\nTrying to find some explanation for the alignment of the existing\r\nbank, it had also occurred to me, that the line of the bank may have\r\nfollowed the ridge of the bar, that would have been formed across\r\nthe wider part of the entrance to the Fayûm by the high level water\r\nflowing in. This bar would, if it had existed, have been the first\r\nland to show above water on the subsidence of the floods, and may\r\nhave been chosen, on the occasion of one of the repeated breaches at\r\nHawârat-el-Maqta, as the most convenient line for forming a bank\r\nto shut out the Nile flood. But this would have been at a later\r\ndate, after Lake Mœris had ceased to perform its functions of a\r\nNile regulator.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the former supposition, that the bank B _c_ was part\r\nof an old bank, formed for quite another than its present purpose,\r\nand that the bank _g_ B was subsequently made between Lahûn and the\r\ndesert (perhaps when the existing old Lahûn regulator was made),\r\na more likely explanation. The length B _d_ would have disappeared\r\nafter it ceased to perform any useful function.\r\n\r\nThere may have been both, or one, or neither of the regulators A and\r\nB, but if there was a regulator at Hawârah at the head of the lake\r\nat F, there would have been little to be gained except additional\r\nsecurity from the regulator A.\r\n\r\nIf then we suppose that the bank _c_ B _d_ and the regulator B\r\nonly existed to collect the flood waters, and turn them into the\r\nlake, and that a regulator at Hawârah at F also existed to keep\r\nexcess water out of the lake, such an arrangement would agree with\r\nStrabo’s statement that “when the river falls, the lake again\r\ndischarges the water by a canal at both orifices, and it is available\r\nfor irrigation. There are regulators at both ends of the canal for\r\nregulating the inflow and outflow.”\r\n\r\nThe part A _b_ of one of these suggested banks exists to-day, as\r\na lately abandoned basin bank, with regulators in it, but there\r\nis nothing, that I know of, to show that it existed in the time of\r\nLake Mœris. At the western desert end, _a_, of the supposed bank,\r\nstands the village Tamma. Dr. Schweinfurth says this is certainly\r\nan ancient Egyptian name, and he describes some remarkable mounds\r\nof pure black Nile earth, containing no trace of bricks, sherds,\r\nstones from buildings, or other things, which lie just to the south\r\nof the modern village in four symmetrically placed hills, containing\r\nabout 300,000 cubic metres.\r\n\r\nPossibly the ancient Tamma was in some way connected with Lake Mœris,\r\nbut the riddle of the mounds has not yet been solved. They appeared\r\nto me to be the remains of the mouth of a canal taking off from a\r\nbend of the Bahr Yûsuf, but the great height and contour of the\r\nmounds and the abruptness with which they commence and terminate\r\nare not to be easily accounted for. The alignment of the canal,\r\nif such it was, points towards the entrance valley to the Fayûm.\r\n\r\nOn the east of Lahûn village there are also some mounds of moderate\r\nheight, but of short length, which are evidently the remains of two\r\nold parallel canals, both pointing in the direction of the Fayûm. The\r\nabruptness with which these banks begin and end is also remarkable.\r\n\r\nSupposing then, that the Nile levels in the time of Herodotus were\r\n2 metres lower than those of to-day, the conception of Lake Mœris\r\nmust be modified as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe lowest level to which Lake Mœris fell in summer was R.L. 17·50\r\nabove mean sea, and it was filled to levels ranging between\r\nR.L. 20·50 and 22·50, but its level was never allowed to exceed\r\nthe latter level. Probably there was a regulator and bank passing\r\nthrough Lahûn from west to east between the main and detached\r\ndesert preventing the flow of the Bahr Yûsuf waters to the north,\r\nand so diverting them into Lake Mœris; and also another regulator\r\nat Hawârah to forbid the admission of an excessive volume into the\r\nlake (Plate XXI.). On each side of this latter regulator may have\r\nbeen sluices, on the right to feed a canal to irrigate during flood\r\ntime the high land, between Hawârah pyramid and the present railway\r\nline, along the course of the old Bahr Wardan; and on the left to\r\nadmit water into the reclaimed tract round about Crocodilopolis,\r\nperhaps along the present course of the Bahr Yûsuf, for irrigation\r\nand navigation.\r\n\r\nThe old Edwah-Biahmu-Sinrû bank, instead of having been formed in\r\nwater, would have been thrown up along the edge of the water when at\r\nits lowest level. The Biahmu landing-place would have been projected\r\ninto the lake to obtain a quay for embarkation and disembarkation\r\nand possibly a channel would have been dug between the two colossi,\r\nso that boats might come alongside even at low water; a channel\r\nabout 2 metres deep being sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe Edwah-Sinrû bank would have been subjected to most severe wave\r\naction, and could not have stood, unless we suppose it to have\r\nbeen well revetted with stone on the lake face. Probably it was,\r\nbut the stone has entirely disappeared, a thing not incredible, when\r\none considers how little has been left of the wonderful Labyrinth\r\ndescribed by Herodotus and others after him.\r\n\r\nBut if the conclusion, that the Nile water-levels have risen at\r\nthe rate of 4 inches a century, be a correct one, and if it may be\r\nassumed that the rise has been continuous and uniform in historic\r\ntimes, the levels at the time of the XIIth dynasty (B.C. 2500), when\r\nLake Mœris is supposed to have been formed, would have been about\r\n4½ metres lower than at present. Under such conditions R.L. 23·50\r\nwould have been the highest level reached by the floods at the\r\nLahûn entrance; and therefore, at the site of the modern Medineh,\r\nthe water-level would have been somewhat lower. Such a state of things\r\nwould have permitted the establishment of the town “Shad” without\r\nthe necessity of any arrangements for controlling the admission\r\nof the water. To what minimum levels the Nile fell, after it had\r\nfirst flowed at higher levels, and how far back the change from a\r\ndeepening of its bed by scour to a raising of it by deposit took\r\nplace is a geological question; but if the Nile flood maximum ever\r\nfell as low as about R.L. 18·00 at the Lahûn entrance, no water\r\nwould have entered the Fayûm, since the rock bed at Hawârah is\r\nsomewhere about this level. (Linant’s Hawârah sill at R.L. 21·00\r\nis known to be higher than the bed of the natural channel, which runs\r\nbetween the village of Hawârat-el-Maqta and the Hawârah pyramid.)\r\n\r\nImagination thus may draw another picture of a time when, after the\r\nFayûm deposit had been laid down by the Nile flowing at high levels,\r\nthe gradual scouring of the Nile bed lowered the flood water surface\r\nto such an extent that the supply, which kept the Fayûm Lake full,\r\nwas gradually shut off, until, at last, the maximum flood level\r\nfalling below that of the lowest rock surface between Lahûn and\r\nHawârah, no water would have flowed into the Fayûm, and the lake\r\nwould have dried up and left the land barren for want of a water\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nAfter the opposite action set in and the Nile levels rose again,\r\nthe flow into the Fayûm would recommence and gradually increase\r\ncentury by century, until at last levels would be reached favourable\r\nto the establishment of the town “Shad” on the site of the\r\nmodern Medineh.\r\n\r\nThe Nile continuing to rise, protecting banks to keep the waters of\r\nthe lake, when at flood levels, from the cultivation and habitations\r\nwould have been found necessary, and at last the capital itself would\r\nhave been threatened by the gradually increasing level reached by\r\nthe highest floods. Then, if not before, measures to regulate the\r\ninflow and to facilitate the outflow would be taken to protect the\r\nhighest parts of the province from submersion, and means such as\r\nthose suggested before would be resorted to to reclaim some of the\r\ninvaded lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing was written, Brugsch Pasha, a leading\r\nEgyptologist, has delivered a lecture in Cairo to the Khedivial\r\nGeographical Society on the 8th April, 1892, from which I quote the\r\nfollowing passage, showing that the Pasha’s conclusions, drawn\r\nfrom a study of the monuments, agree with the conclusions I have\r\narrived at from a study of the levels and features of the ground in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Hawârah.\r\n\r\n“Nul doute que le vaste gouffre de 20-30 mètres de hauteur qui\r\ns’ouvre entre les bords occidentaux du désert de Hawara et les\r\nterrains cultivés du côté opposé est, qui, maintenant, porte le\r\nnom de “la Mer sans eau” (_Bahr-bela-ma_) formait anciennement\r\nune partie du lac Mœris. C’est ainsi que ce dernier avait acquis\r\nfortuitement une signification funéraire en rapport avec le culte\r\ndes morts, qui, d’après la tradition en vogue chez les anciens\r\nÉgyptiens, devaient passer en bateau le Nil ou un lac pour aborder au\r\nport de la nécropole et à l’entrée du monde souterrain. Hawara\r\nreprésentait depuis les temps de la XIIme dynastie le cimetière\r\nde la ville Crocodilopolis-Arsinoë, près de Medinet-el-Fayoum;\r\nles défunts étaient transportés sur les canaux jusqu’au lac,\r\nqu’ils traversaient pour arriver au port de la nécropole. Les\r\ntextes que j’ai consultés lors de mon dernier séjour à Hawara,\r\nne parlent de la terre du lac qu’en la mettant en rapport avec\r\nl’Osiris de la nécropole de Hawara.\r\n\r\n“Un canal principal (ou si l’on veut plusieurs peut-être)\r\nconduisait l’eau du lac au pied du plateau de Hawara vers la\r\nmétropole qui, à l’époque des Pharaons, s’appelait “Shad”\r\net dont l’existence remonte au moins jusqu’au règne d’Amenemhê\r\nIer, le fondateur de la XIIme dynastie. Les dernières fouilles que\r\nj’ai exécutées à Médineh, mettent ce fait hors de doute. Il\r\nparaît même que l’ancienne ville de Shad formait la résidence\r\ndes rois de cette dynastie, dont les pyramides s’élèvent sur le\r\nsol de la terre du lac.”\r\n\r\nThis statement about the principal canal (or several canals), leading\r\nfrom the lake at the foot of Hawârah towards “Shad,” accords\r\nwith my conceptions of the lake, but not with Linant’s; as in _his_\r\ntheory all this plateau between Hawârah and the modern Medineh,\r\nor ancient Shad, was lake, and a canal or canals could not have been\r\nmade in the lake itself. If then this fact about a canal leading from\r\nthe lake at the foot of Hawârah to Shad is proved beyond a doubt,\r\nLinant’s theory is disproved by Brugsch Pasha himself, though he\r\npreviously states that no “savant sérieux” is opposed to it.\r\n\r\nIn this same paper, from which I am quoting, this further passage also\r\noccurs, which agrees with what I have imagined to have been the early\r\nhistory of the town, on part of the ruins of which Medineh now stands.\r\n\r\n“La terre du lac, ainsi que je l’ai déjà fait remarquer, a\r\ndû exister au commencement de la XIIme dynastie, dont le premier\r\nroi, Amenemhè Ier, avait fondé au bord de la ville Médineh un\r\nsanctuaire au Dieu Sobk. Au delà de cette époque je ne trouve\r\naucune trace de sa mention dans les textes de l’ancien empire:\r\nl’œuvre de l’arrosement du Fayoum par un canal du Nil doit donc\r\nêtre reportée au moins jusqu’à l’époque du roi que je viens de\r\nciter. Également à cette époque, la fondation d’un sanctuaire et\r\nd’un palais royal fait supposer l’existence d’une résidence,\r\nc’est-à-dire d’une grande ville à laquelle le canal Hounet\r\nfournissait ses eaux.\r\n\r\n“Tout porte à croire que le canal fut creusé longtemps avant le\r\nXIIme dynastie, car une résidence ne s’établit pas dans un pays\r\ninhabitable ou qui venait à peine d’être arrosé. L’opinion\r\nque les rois de la XIIme dynastie doivent être regardés comme\r\nles créateurs du canal Hounet n’est plus à soutenir, le Fayoum\r\n‘la terre du lac’ date certainement d’une époque de beaucoup\r\nantérieure à la XIIme dynastie, et les rois de cette maison\r\nroyale, pour des raisons que nous ignorons, ont seulement choisi\r\ncette terre pour y transférer leur résidence et les temples de\r\nleurs divinités.”\r\n\r\nHow this view is made to accord with the Linant Lake conception is\r\nnot clear, but it is not opposed to the idea that a natural lake,\r\nconnected by a natural channel with the Nile Valley, existed and made\r\nthe growth of the town “Shad” a possibility before the canal\r\nwas remodelled, and control of the entry and exit of the waters\r\nintroduced by the engineering monarchs of the XIIth dynasty.\r\n\r\n\r\n        TRANSFORMATION OF LAKE MŒRIS INTO THE FAYÛM OF TO-DAY.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the conception of Lake Mœris, as given in this paper,\r\nis a true one, we have now to consider how the change to present\r\nconditions in the Fayûm came about.\r\n\r\nIn the passage quoted from ‘Hawara, Biahmu, and Arsinoë,’\r\nMr. Petrie states that “apparently under the Persians or Ptolemies\r\nthe desire to acquire more land in the Fayûm at the expense of\r\nthe irrigation of the Nile valley, led to restricting the inflow,\r\nand gradually drying up the lake.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cope Whitehouse, in one of his papers, points out that Mœris,\r\nin its character of regulator and reservoir, existed chiefly for\r\nremote provinces, and therefore required for its maintenance a strong\r\ncentral government with sufficient administrative skill and energy to\r\ntake the necessary steps and to expend the necessary amount of money\r\nto secure the maintenance of the reservoir, canal, and regulators\r\nin working order. Under a careless government, or while anarchy, or\r\ninternal or external troubles weakened administration, the private\r\ninterests of individuals who were on the spot to assert themselves,\r\nwould have prevailed over the public claims of the Northerners,\r\npowerless to keep watch over and to insist upon their rights from\r\nthe distant towns of the Delta. A corrupt Public Works Department,\r\nuncontrolled by a chief with broad views of what was desirable in the\r\ngeneral interests of Egypt, may have permitted each chief engineer\r\nof a nome to do what seemed good in his own eyes for the profit\r\nof the particular part of Egypt in which he was the Public Works\r\nofficer. If we imagine that he had scruples, there have not been\r\nabsent, in the modern history of the Irrigation Department of Egypt,\r\ninstances of the application of means for overcoming scruples, and,\r\nas so much else in the customs of the country can be traced back\r\nto that far past time when Lake Mœris must have been languishing\r\ntowards extinction, we may also suppose that the Eastern salve for\r\ntender consciences was applied and the scruples overcome.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the cause (and there is nothing but speculation,\r\nwhich can help us to imagine it), at some time or other, either by a\r\ngradual or sudden process, Lake Mœris ceased to perform its offices\r\nof regulator and reservoir, which had won for it the admiration of\r\nall who visited it. Having once reached the stage when it ceased to\r\nbe useful in supplementing the low Nile, there would be nothing to\r\nprevent measures being taken to exclude all water, but such as was\r\nnecessary for the irrigation of the reclaimed areas. Evaporation would\r\nlower the Lake level year by year, and leave more land uncovered. Year\r\nby year the Lake would contract itself, and retire to lower levels,\r\nuntil it had reached the present dimensions of the modern Lake Qurûn,\r\nwhose water surface at the commencement of May 1892 was 43·50 metres\r\nbelow mean sea-level. The rate of the lake’s retreat was doubtless\r\nnot uniform and continuous, but was retarded by accidents and breaches\r\nof the barrier, raised against the Nile floods, causing a return of\r\nthe water over reclaimed lands. The deep ravines of the Fayûm are\r\nnature’s bold strokes on the face of the province, which record\r\nsome of the victories of the water, in its efforts to fulfil the\r\nlaw imposed on it to find its own level, over man’s endeavours to\r\ncontrol this law.\r\n\r\nEvaporation by itself, had its results not been vitiated by other\r\ncauses, would have lowered the lake surface by about 2 metres a year,\r\nbut the drainage and waste from the reclaimed area under irrigation\r\nwould have retarded the fall, and breaches would probably have\r\noccasionally converted the fall into a rise. It is therefore difficult\r\nto assign dates for different levels of the lake surface, but probably\r\nthe old towns at different levels around the borders of the Fayûm,\r\nso far as their dates can be fixed, will, when their levels have\r\nbeen correctly ascertained, throw some light on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe former manner of conducting the irrigation of parts of the\r\nprovince would have caused a much larger proportionate discharge into\r\nthe lake, than finds its way to it at present. Considerable areas\r\nwere enclosed by banks, and inundated under the Basin system, known\r\nin the Fayûm as “Malaq,” in contradistinction to irrigation by\r\nsmall field channels, a system called “Misqâwi.” The contents of\r\nthese small basins, when emptied, flowed into the lake. On the south\r\nside of the Fayûm there was, until late years, a large basin known\r\nas “Hod-el-Tuyûr” (the Basin of the Birds), which was formed by\r\nbuilding an immense wall across a fold of contour R.L. 15·00. The\r\ntop of this wall is about R.L. 16·00. The bed of the basin is at\r\nR.L. 12·00, so we may conclude that, when this wall was built, the\r\nlake levels must have been at any rate below R.L. 12·00. This basin\r\nwas abolished in 1886, and ordinary perennial irrigation introduced\r\nover the area formerly included within the basin limits. Since then\r\nthe fall of the lake surface has been more rapid, in spite of its\r\nannually diminishing evaporating area.\r\n\r\nThe existing lake, which is the rudiment of the large lake that once\r\nfilled the whole of the Fayûm depression, is called Lake Qurûn,\r\nor el-Qurn, the Lake of the Horns, or the Horn, apparently so named\r\nfrom a rock that projects into the lake from its west side and\r\ncalled “el-Qurn.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the levels of the rock bed underlying the Nile\r\ndeposit near Hawârah, that the original course of the waters flowing\r\ninto Lake Mœris (after it became Lake Mœris by introducing means of\r\ncontrolling its waters) must have been along the ravine which runs to\r\nthe north of the modern village of Hawârat-el-Maqta. The bed of the\r\npresent Bahr Yûsuf, at a point about a kilometre below that village,\r\nis rock at R.L. 21·00, and this rock joins the high desert on the\r\nsouth of the Bahr Yûsuf. But on the north it dips down, and close\r\nunder Hawârat-el-Maqta has been found to have its original surface\r\nat R.L. 19·17, dipping still lower towards the north-east. Plate\r\nXXV. gives cross-sections of the entrance valley of the Fayûm,\r\nand also of the ravine behind Hawârat-el-Maqta.\r\n\r\n“Hawârat-el-Maqta” signifies “Hawârah of the Breach,” and\r\nround about this village lay the battlefields where many a struggle\r\nwas made by man to get the mastery of the water, until he at last\r\nprevailed. Massive walls and solid banks, retaining the Bahr Yûsuf\r\nin its high level channel, and barring the passage into ravines,\r\nscoured out by previous torrents of water bursting away from control,\r\nmark the sites of many a breach, and suggest sleepless and anxious\r\nnights of hard labour for the wretched irrigation officer in charge\r\nin the days when the water seemed to have asserted its rights to\r\nflow where it pleased.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the Bahr Yûsuf are the remains of a channel, which\r\nwas clearly a temporary one for carrying the water, while a breach\r\nnear Hawârat-el-Maqta was being repaired. Linant Pasha tells of the\r\noccurrence of one of these breaches on the west of Hawârat-el-Maqta\r\nas late as the commencement of this century (in 1819 or 1820). He\r\nstates that this breach caused much damage. An attempt was made to\r\nclose it during the floods, but in spite of all that could be done,\r\nand in spite of the energy of the people employed by Mehemet Ali,\r\nit was not till after six months at the time of low water that the\r\nclosure was effected. It appears that the old bridge at Lahûn (the\r\nonly one existing at the time) could not be closed, when the breach\r\noccurred, probably for want of suitable closing apparatus. This\r\nbreach was down-stream of the rock bed in the Bahr Yûsuf.\r\n\r\nWhen the level of Lake Mœris was kept up to levels above R.L. 17·50,\r\nthe regulator at Hawârah near the Labyrinth, which I have supposed\r\ncontrolled the entry of the water into the lake, would have admitted\r\nthe flood waters freely until the lake rose to the maximum allowable,\r\nsay R.L. 22·00. If then closed, and supposing the Nile levels to\r\nhave been 2 metres lower then than now, the regulator would probably\r\nhave been subjected to a head of about 3 metres as a maximum, but\r\nafterwards when Lake Mœris ceased its functions and the lake fell\r\nto low levels, the regulator would have had to hold up a head of\r\nwater equal to the depth of water on its floor, in order to exclude\r\nthe water from the lake. The right and left side channels would have\r\ntaken in water from above the regulator for irrigating the reclaimed\r\ntracts. The drainage of the irrigated areas would have commenced\r\nto form drainage channels, the right drainage following the bed\r\nof the original inflow channel into Lake Mœris. As the lake level\r\ncontinued to fall, the drains would have scoured themselves out to\r\nlower levels, and cut back. The canals too would then have breached\r\ninto the deepening ravines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXV.\r\n\r\nCROSS SECTION OF THE ENTRANCE VALLEY TO THE FAYÛM AT THE OLD BAHR\r\nWARDAN MOUTH, 3 KILOMETRES ABOVE HAWÂRAT-EL-MAQTA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS SECTION OF RAVINE BEHIND HAWÂRAT-EL-MAQTA.]\r\n\r\nOn the opposite sides of the ravine and in face of the village of\r\nHawârat-el-Maqta, during one of my inspections, I came across\r\nthe remains of two ancient canals, shown on the sketch map,\r\nPlate XXVI. Starting from the present edge of the ravine are two\r\nold canals, clearly distinguishable as such by the existing banks,\r\nwhich are of considerable height. In the angle between the two are\r\nthe remains of an ancient town, and fragments of granite pillars. One\r\nof these fragments was part of the shaft of a large pillar of the\r\nclustered-stalk design.\r\n\r\nBoth these canals, after a few hundred yards, lose themselves in\r\nbroken ground sloping down and tailing into the main ravine.\r\n\r\nProbably the left canal was the first made, and, when it breached\r\ninto the ravine on its left, the right canal was made to take its\r\nplace, which in its turn also breached and found its way into the\r\nravine. The take-off was then shifted farther up the Bahr Yûsuf\r\nto the position of the present head of the Bahr Sêlah. The dotted\r\nlines show the supposed continuations of the two old canals. To feed\r\nthem, either the ravine must have been dammed below their present\r\ntake-off from it, or else they must have been continued across the\r\nhead of the ravine to the banks of the Bahr Yûsuf. The fact that the\r\nsecond diversion diverges from the old canal just where it leaves the\r\nravine, suggests the former alternative, but more probably this was\r\nmade the point of departure from the first channel so as to utilise\r\nthe banks, which already existed, for crossing the ravine and avoid\r\nthe necessity for making a new crossing.\r\n\r\nJoined on to the breached end of the left canal there exist some\r\ncurious vestiges of irrigation works, which have failed. It appears\r\nthat there was originally an earth dam A B joining the banks of one\r\nor other of these two old canals with a point in the direction of\r\nor across the ravine. In the line of this bank where the height was\r\ngreatest, was a thick masonry wall, now known as “Hêt Rozma.”\r\nThis wall is made of brick and rubble stone of a very inferior\r\nquality, built in mortar made of lime and mud; it is 90 metres in\r\nlength, 5 metres thick, and 6·70 metres high. (The top of this\r\nwall is at R.L. 21·35.) The bare end of the wall is evidently the\r\noriginal masonry end, as it was built, no part of the wall having\r\nbeen carried away when the bank, which must have joined its outer\r\nend, disappeared. The bank, of which this wall formed the centre,\r\nevidently breached and scoured out a hole, marked by the pool C\r\nbelow the breach. This breach was repaired by adding an inclined\r\nwall D E to the Hêt Rozma, continued by an earth bank E F to the\r\nbank of the old left canal. Again another bank G F seems to have\r\nbeen formed above this, and to have breached. The violent action of\r\nthe water is shown by the circular hollow H, which has been scooped\r\nout of the level ground _upstream_ of this breach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVI.\r\n\r\n_Stanford Geog. Estab. London_\r\n\r\nSKETCH MAP OF THE GROUND BETWEEN HAWÂRAT-EL-MAQTA AND HAWÂRAH\r\nPYRAMID.\r\n\r\n_Note._—The ravines are not correctly mapped, but only sketched\r\nin to show generally how the ground is broken up.]\r\n\r\nI give this description to indicate what interesting problems there\r\nare to solve, or lose oneself in conjectures about, in various\r\nparts of the Fayûm Province, and especially in the neighbourhood\r\nof Hawârat-el-Maqta and the wonderful Labyrinth.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven then the actual conditions of a considerable difference of\r\nlevel, continually increasing, between the water at its entrance\r\nto the Fayûm, and the lake surface, and, from an irrigation point\r\nof view, a steep surface slope to the country under irrigation,\r\nravines would commence to form along the lines where drainage and the\r\nwater, discharged by canal breaches, would collect to flow towards\r\nthe lake. Wherever also an inundated area, surrounded by banks,\r\neffected the discharge of the water contained in the basin, there\r\nwould be made the beginning of a ravine, which may afterwards have\r\nbeen utilised as an irrigation or drainage channel.\r\n\r\nThe main drainage lines of the north and south were naturally formed\r\nalong the lines, where the rounded concentric contours of the central\r\npart of the Fayûm double back to run along the north and south sides\r\nof the depression, as shown in the diagram (Plate XIX.). At many\r\npoints the rock being reached, further deepening of the channel was\r\nchecked. The rock being close to the surface along the upper part\r\nof the course of the south main drainage line, a deep ravine has\r\nnot been formed, until after the village of Miniet-el-Hêt is passed.\r\n\r\nBut the north drainage line has been scoured out and cut back to the\r\nbanks of the Bahr Yûsuf itself, so that deep ravines exist within\r\na short distance of and parallel to its present watercourse. Into\r\nthese ravines a breach would precipitate all the main canal supply,\r\nif such were to occur from negligence or from rashly permitting\r\nirrigation to be conducted from heads roughly constructed by the\r\nfellahîn in the Bahr Yûsuf banks.\r\n\r\nProbably some small village channel, allowed to take off directly\r\nfrom the Bahr Yûsuf without a proper head, and used to irrigate\r\nsome low lands along the slopes of the main ravine, caused a minor\r\nravine to commence and grow, until, cutting back as far as its head,\r\nit eventually gave rise to the breach of 1820, which resulted in\r\na widening out of the branch ravine until it attained its present\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, evident that, when Lake Mœris ceased to be,\r\nHawârat-el-Maqta was the key to the position and the point where the\r\nproblem of the Fayûm irrigation had to be solved. It was necessary\r\nfor the irrigation of the whole province, that the water-level should\r\nbe held up at this point, so as to flow along the ridge between\r\nHawârat-el-Maqta and Medineh, from which the whole province, with\r\nthe exception of the land on the right of the north drainage line,\r\nwas commanded. For the irrigation from the Bahr Sêlah or from the\r\nancient canals, of which the Bahr Sêlah is the modern representative,\r\nit was necessary also that the water should not be allowed to run\r\nto low levels down the ravine at the back of Hawârat-el-Maqta. The\r\nprincipal operation then to be performed was to bar this ravine to\r\nthe passage of the water, and to make the water flow forward along\r\nthe ridge to Medineh at a high enough level at least to pass over\r\nthe rocky bed, which is now found in the modern Bahr Yûsuf about a\r\nkilometre beyond Hawârah. This end being attained, the water would\r\nflow along the ridge, from the sides and end of which it would be\r\ndistributed into the different branch canals covering the face of\r\nthe province. Works to control the quantity of water given to each\r\nbranch, and weirs to head-up the water at intervals along the canals\r\nof too rapid a slope would have been added as the want of them made\r\nitself felt.\r\n\r\nThe lake level would become lower year by year, and more land would\r\nbe reclaimed and brought under cultivation.\r\n\r\nAt some period of this process, probably after a breach at\r\nHawârat-el-Maqta, or on the failure of the regulator supposed to have\r\nformerly existed at Hawârah, the Lahûn bank and its old regulator\r\nwould have been formed to exclude the excess of water and to control\r\nthe discharge admitted into the Fayûm. (For sections of these banks,\r\nsee Plate XXVII.)\r\n\r\nI have suggested before that the part of the Lahûn bank which runs\r\neast and west was made in the time of Lake Mœris, and that the\r\npart from Lahûn to the south side of the gap, which crosses the\r\nBahr Yûsuf at the old Lahûn Bridge, was subsequently made to shut\r\nout the Nile floods, when for some reason the means of regulation\r\nwithin the Fayûm at Hawârah ceased to be efficient.\r\n\r\nThe old Lahûn Bridge has three openings of 2·67 width, the floor\r\nlevel of two of them being at R.L. 21·97 and of the third at\r\nR.L. 20·72, so that this bridge could only have been constructed\r\n_after_ the discharge required by the Fayûm had fallen to the amount\r\nof its present requirements, or to even less, as the waterway is\r\nsomewhat under what is desirable for the passage of 7 million cubic\r\nmetres a day, the maximum discharge utilised in the Fayûm at the\r\npresent day during floods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVII.\r\n\r\nBANK RIGHT OF LAHÛN BRIDGE, OR GISR GADALLAH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANK LEFT OF LAHÛN BRIDGE, OR GISR BAHLAWÂN.\r\n\r\nCROSS SECTIONS OF LAHÛN BANKS.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the remains of canals along the north and south\r\nsides of the Fayûm, that at some time or other these slopes of the\r\nprovince were irrigated to higher levels than the limit of the present\r\ncultivation. On the right the old Bahr Wardan is traceable from its\r\nold mouth on the Bahr Yûsuf (Kom-el-Iswid) above the present Sêlah\r\nHead as far as the north-west corner of the Fayûm depression. It\r\nwould appear that the water surface level of the Bahr Yûsuf at\r\nHawârah must be lower now than when this canal was under conditions\r\nfavourable for irrigation. Perhaps it worked when the regulator was,\r\nas supposed, at Hawârah, and before the Lahûn bank and old bridge\r\nshut out the high-level waters of the Nile flood.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the Fayûm there are similarly the remains\r\nof an old canal within the limits of what is now desert. This was\r\nprobably fed by an aqueduct formed along the top of the Minia wall,\r\nwhich held up the waters in Hod-el-Tuyûr. This wall and aqueduct were\r\nbreached, and though the wall was restored, the aqueduct was not, and\r\nthe supply was cut off from the high-level canal. The land depending\r\non it consequently returned to desert. Large blocks of old masonry\r\nlying prone on the ground at some distance from the present wall\r\nshow with what force the escaping waters must have rushed through\r\nthe breaches to have been able to transport such massive blocks to\r\nso great a distance from their original position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n THE FAYÛM IN THE FUTURE, AND POSSIBLE UTILISATION OF THE WADI RAIÂN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of storage reservoirs for husbanding the flood or winter\r\nsurplus waters of the Nile with the object of supplementing the Low\r\nNile is now under consideration and _sub judice_. Mr. W. Willcocks,\r\nM.I.C.E., has been appointed Director-General of Works for the study\r\nof this subject, and his final report has not yet been made.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that the total of the Nile discharges for even\r\na minimum year is more than sufficient for all the needs of Egypt,\r\ndeveloped to its fullest extent, and the main question to decide is\r\nwhere the reservoir is to be made and what form it is to take.\r\n\r\nPortions of the Nile Valley itself could be made to store the water\r\nby forming one or several masonry dams across the Nile, and the Wadi\r\nRaiân could also be made to serve the same purpose by putting it\r\ninto communication with the Nile by means of a channel cut in the\r\nrange of hills which divides the depression from the Nile Valley.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the advantages of the different methods of forming\r\nNile reservoirs does not belong to this paper, but there is a\r\nprobability that a reservoir in some form will be made, and that the\r\nFayûm will receive its share of the resulting increase of the summer\r\nwater supply. Its present summer supply would probably be doubled,\r\nwhich would enable the province to increase the area under cotton\r\nfrom about 50,000 to 100,000 feddans, but would otherwise have no\r\ngreat effect on the province. The expansion of the present area\r\nunder cultivation in the Fayûm to the lands along the north-east\r\nand south borders of the province does not depend so much on an\r\nincrease to the present supply as on the construction of canals\r\ndesigned to carry sufficient water at a high enough level to command\r\nthe lands above the present limits of cultivation. There is no want\r\nof water during Nile flood time outside the intake of the Fayûm,\r\nbut its present canals will not carry more than a total discharge\r\nof 7,000,000 cubic metres a day, and therefore that is the maximum\r\nallowed to pass through the Lahûn bridges.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Wadi Raiân were to be made a reservoir, the\r\nreclamation of the lands along the south and south-west borders of\r\nthe Fayûm would be made comparatively easy. What this area amounts\r\nto is rather uncertain.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter III. the conclusion was arrived at, that the Wadi Raiân\r\ndepression had never hitherto acted as a regulator to control the\r\nNile floods and supplement the Low Nile, and that its past history\r\nshows no record of useful work, so far as the irrigation of Egypt is\r\nconcerned. But this fact does not affect the question of its possible\r\nuses in the future, for which its physical features and geographical\r\nposition may fit it. It is a depression, separated by a short width of\r\nhill from the Nile Valley, and if filled with water up to R.L. 24·00,\r\nwould become a lake, having a surface area of about 600 million\r\nsquare metres, and a greatest depth of 64 metres. There is no doubt\r\nthat the communication could be made; the only question is, would it\r\nbe worth the expense, and could not better results be obtained for\r\nthe same expenditure by the adoption of other rival projects. This\r\nquestion is now being considered by the Ministry of Public Works.\r\n\r\nThere are four uses which the Wadi Raiân depression might be made\r\nto serve, if a communication with the Nile Valley were established.\r\n\r\nIt might be used,\r\n\r\n  (1)  As a reservoir of control for the Nile floods.\r\n\r\n  (2)  As a reservoir of storage to supplement the Low Nile.\r\n\r\n  (3)  As an area to be brought under cultivation.\r\n\r\n  (4)  As a receptacle for the drainage of the Nile Valley during the\r\n       flood season.\r\n\r\n(1) It would not make an efficient regulator for the control of the\r\nNile floods, unless it were to be expressly reserved for this object,\r\nand its level kept low until all fear of the necessity of relief\r\narising had passed. If it were considered necessary to provide for\r\nthe relief of the Nile to the extent of 100 million cubic metres\r\nper day for 30 days, the lake, having an area (at R.L. 24·00) of\r\n600 million square metres, should be kept at such a level as would\r\nallow of its receiving the 3000 million cubic metres without checking\r\nthe inflow in consequence of its surface level becoming too high. An\r\naddition of 3000 million cubic metres to the reservoir would raise it\r\nabout 4¾ metres, allowing for evaporation for 30 days. This is about\r\nthe extreme duty the Wadi could perform as a reservoir of control,\r\nif it were expressly reserved as such; but, if it is to serve this\r\nobject alone, the expenditure, which would be incurred in fitting\r\nit to do so, would certainly be considered out of proportion to the\r\nbenefits to be obtained. An attempt to combine the two duties of\r\ncontroller of Nile floods, and feeder to Low Niles would probably\r\nresult in failure, as the necessity of keeping the reservoir level\r\nlow to fit it to act as an escape-valve during September might make\r\nit impossible to raise the level afterwards to a sufficient height\r\nto render it an efficient feeder to the Low Nile.\r\n\r\n(2) It would, however, make an efficient feeder for supplementing\r\nthe Low Nile, if the control of the flood Nile were neglected. If\r\nconnected with the Nile about Beni Suef, and also with the Bahr\r\nYûsuf (which could continue to flow into it after the Nile\r\nceased to do so), the reservoir could easily be filled to R.L. +\r\n26·00. Assuming R.L. 21·00 as the level to which the water in\r\nthe reservoir would fall in summer, and allowing one metre for\r\nevaporation for six months, the volume required to fill the lake\r\nfrom R.L. 21 to 26 would be 600,000,000 square metres × (5 + 1) =\r\n3600 million cubic metres. From November to January, say 90 days,\r\nthe Bahr Yûsuf could supply an average of 12 million cubic metres\r\na day at least, or 1080 million cubic metres, leaving 2520 million\r\ncubic metres for the direct Nile feeder during the 90 days of flood,\r\nor an average of 28 million cubic metres a day.\r\n\r\nThe reservoir would return to the Nile Valley 600,000,000 × (5 - 1)\r\n= 2400 million cubic metres. Allowing for a loss of 10 per cent. in\r\nthe distributing canals outside the reservoir, we get a supply of\r\n(2400 - 240 =) 2160 million cubic metres available for irrigation.\r\n\r\nNow 60 days is given as the critical period in Lower Egypt, when\r\nthe Nile supply is generally insufficient. Subtracting 160 million\r\ncubic metres for the Fayûm, the 2000 million cubic metres remaining\r\nwould therefore give an average discharge of 33 million cubic metres\r\na day to supplement the Low Nile, and, if distributed in increasing\r\nquantities in proportion as the Nile fell, it might be so arranged as\r\nto prevent the Nile minimum discharge ever falling below 50 million\r\ncubic metres a day in the very lowest years of summer Nile.\r\n\r\nBut calculating with a period of 100 days, which is the length of\r\nthe critical period for Upper Egypt, we obtain a mean discharge of\r\n20 million cubic metres a day, which might be so distributed as to\r\nprevent the minimum Nile falling at any rate below 45 million cubic\r\nmetres a day, as for instance below:—\r\n\r\n  --+---------------+-----------------------+------------+----------+--\r\n    |               |Minimum Nile Discharge |Supplied by |  Total   |\r\n    |     Month.    |  without Reservoir.   | Reservoir. |Increased |\r\n    |               |   Monthly Average.    |            |Discharge.|\r\n    +---------------+-----------------------+------------+----------+\r\n    |March          |      40,000,000       |  5,000,000 |45,000,000|\r\n    |               |                       |            |          |\r\n    |April          |      35,000,000       | 10,000,000 |45,000,000|\r\n    |               |                       |            |          |\r\n    |May            |      25,000,000       | 20,000,000 |45,000,000|\r\n    |               |                       |            |          |\r\n    |June           |      20,000,000       | 25,000,000 |45,000,000|\r\n    |               |                       |            |          |\r\n    |10 days of July|      30,000,000       | 15,000,000 |45,000,000|\r\n  --+---------------+-----------------------+------------+----------+--\r\n\r\nThis disposes of 1975 millions, whereas 2000 millions was the quantity\r\ncalculated as being available after loss by evaporation in the lake,\r\nand by absorption and evaporation in the distributing canals outside\r\nthe lake. I think, therefore, I have not overstated the capabilities\r\nof the reservoir as a feeder to supplement the Low Nile.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing about the first filling of the lake, which is a\r\nquestion of no small difficulty. To fill it to R.L. 21·00, its low\r\nsummer level when once in working order, would require a volume of\r\n15,000 million cubic metres plus the quantity required to meet loss\r\nby evaporation during the time of filling.\r\n\r\n(3) The idea that the depression might be converted into a cultivated\r\nbasin is, I think, not likely to get beyond the stage of suggestion,\r\nas, with the object only of extending cultivation, the expense\r\nof connecting the Wadi Raiân with the Nile will not be incurred,\r\nsince there are so many other projects of reclamation, which would\r\nneed less expenditure and give a better return.\r\n\r\n(4) The last use to which the Wadi Raiân might be put, and which\r\nhas lately been suggested, is to adapt it for the reception of the\r\ndrainage waters of the Nile Valley, after the basin area of at least\r\nMiddle Egypt has been converted into Sêfi (summer) irrigation by\r\nmeans of the increased supply provided by the assumed existence of\r\nreservoirs in the Upper Nile Valley and a regulating dam at Asyût.\r\n\r\nWhen all these basin lands are converted into tracts under perennial\r\nirrigation, there will be a great difficulty in the disposal of\r\ntheir drainage water during the time of high flood, and the Wadi\r\nRaiân affords a possible means of solving this problem. Even though\r\nthe drainage might gain on evaporation and the Wadi Raiân become\r\neventually full, its water surface could be annually so far lowered\r\nby allowing a flow out into the Nile during the summer months, as\r\nto prepare the basin for the reception of all the drainage it would\r\nbe called upon to receive during the next flood season.\r\n\r\nIt would further be possible to combine the uses Nos. 2 and 4,\r\nand make the depression serve both as a receptacle of the drainage\r\nduring the floods and a reservoir to supplement the Low Nile during\r\nsummer. But it might be objected that the admixture of drainage\r\nwith the reservoir waters, returned to the Nile in summer, might\r\nrender the river water unfit for irrigation. Supposing the drainage\r\ndischarge, which must be received into the reservoir, amounts to 15\r\nmillion cubic metres a day for 80 days (probably a high estimate),\r\nthe total volume of drainage water would amount to 1200 million\r\ncubic metres, or one-third of the quantity of water (3600 million\r\ncubic metres) required to fill the lake from R.L. 21 to 26, or half\r\nof the 2400 million cubic metres returned to the Nile Valley. This\r\nwould be further diluted by the summer discharge of the Nile itself,\r\nto which it would be added.\r\n\r\nIf the reservoir were filled to R.L. 25 during the flood months by\r\nthe drainage and flood waters together, the remaining metre could\r\nbe added by a canal discharging 7 million cubic metres a day for\r\n100 days in winter, and fed from the Ibrahimîyah Canal, or a new\r\nbranch of it, which would replace the Bahr Yûsuf, when the latter\r\nwas converted into the main drainage line consequent on the basin\r\nlands being brought under perennial irrigation.\r\n\r\nIf then the drainage water should not be found salt enough to\r\nseriously affect the quality of the reservoir water, the Wadi Raiân\r\nmight be made to serve both the purposes stated.\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed in previous notes on the subject, that such\r\na reservoir alongside the Fayûm would be capable of giving that\r\nprovince its summer supply, but there would be a difficulty in\r\nthe way of doing this. Under present arrangements the water-level\r\nat the end of the Bahr Yûsuf at Medineh is maintained throughout\r\nthe summer at R.L. 21·70. If the level were to be lowered, lands\r\nnow commanded by the water would cease to be so. The Wadi Raiân\r\nreservoir, whose level has been assumed to fall to R.L. 21·00,\r\nwhile a length of canal of at least 40 kilometres would be required\r\nto convey the water to Medineh, could not, during part of the summer\r\n(after its water surface had fallen below R.L. 23·50) deliver water\r\nat the level at present maintained.\r\n\r\nIt would, probably, therefore be necessary, in spite of the adjacent\r\nreservoir, to supply the Fayûm during summer by a branch from the\r\nIbrahimîyah Canal, but the reservoir could assist by providing\r\nfor the irrigation of all the lands, now cultivated or capable of\r\nbeing reclaimed, on the left of the main south drainage line, and\r\nthe part of the province watered by the Qalamshah Canal; that is,\r\nit would feed the Gharaq, Qalamshah, and Nezlah Canals, and so far\r\nassist in the summer irrigation of the province.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the proximity of a lake of 600 million square metres (280\r\nsquare miles), filled to a high level with reference to the greater\r\npart of the Fayûm, would affect the climate of the province, and\r\nat any rate take some of the heat out of the south winds, which blow\r\nat intervals in March and April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n  Arsinoë, 25\r\n\r\n  Arsinoite Nome, 48, 82\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bahr Yûsuf, 9 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  Biahmu, ruins of, 76, 83; supposed quay at, 85\r\n\r\n  Birket-el-Qurûn, 6-9, 49, 96; area of, 7; evaporation, 9\r\n\r\n  Brugsch Pasha, 39, 93\r\n\r\n\r\n  Canal, the Ibrahimîyah, 10; ruins of two ancient canals, 99\r\n\r\n  Crocodilopolis, 25, 72\r\n\r\n  Crops in the Fayûm, 17\r\n\r\n\r\n  Diodorus, 21, 27\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fayûm, the, 5 _et seq._; area of the Lake Fayûm, 67; derivation of\r\n  name, 24; fisheries in the, 18; geological history of, 61; situation\r\n  of, 5\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hawârah, the pyramid of, 25\r\n\r\n  Hawârat-el-Maqta, 97, 102\r\n\r\n  Helouan, 72\r\n\r\n  Herodotus, 19\r\n\r\n\r\n  Labyrinth, the, 25, 81\r\n\r\n  Levels:—Lowest summer levels at Wâstah, 78; between Dimay and\r\n  Schweinfurth’s Temple, 55\r\n\r\n    _Reduced Levels_:—Bahr Yûsuf, 12; Birket-el-Qurûn, 7; the Fayûm, 30;\r\n    Gharaq Basin, 5; “Hêt Rozma,” 101; Lake Mœris (_max._ and _min._)\r\n    79, 88; Lahûn Bridge, 103; Medineh, 6, 65; of Nile deposit at\r\n    Hawârah, 48, 65; Nile deposit at Lahûn, 48; at Wâstah in April, 66;\r\n    rock sill at Hawârah, 48; ruins of Dimay, 51; Temple of\r\n    Schweinfurth, 52; Wadi Raiân, 5, 42\r\n\r\n  Linant Pasha, theories of, 28 _et seq._; difficulties of his theory,\r\n  30; inaccuracies of his theory, 34\r\n\r\n\r\n  Medineh, the town of, 6, 92\r\n\r\n  Mœris, the Lake, 19 _et seq._; Arabic tradition concerning, 22;\r\n  identical with Fayûm depression, 48; in the time of Herodotus, 88;\r\n  decline of, 95; inflow and outflow of, 77; levels of Nile and lake,\r\n  79; supposed regulators of, 73, 89; supposed maker of, 69; volume of\r\n  water required to fill, 79; Cope Whitehouse’s theory concerning, 5,\r\n  37, 40; objections to his theory, 42 _et seq._; Petrie’s theory, 56-60\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nile, the, gradual rise of water-level, 87, 92; the river in the days\r\n  of Herodotus, 87\r\n\r\n\r\n  Petrie, W.

Crossing to Dimay, the greatest depth I obtained\r\nwas 4·85 metres, but the fishermen said that at a point towards the\r\nsouth-west four times that depth was to be found, but I have not yet\r\nbeen able to verify this statement.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Its actual height is under 6 metres as a maximum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I believe the ridge east of Edwah and running parallel\r\nto the railway along its south side is natural. Its crest has a\r\ndecided inclination downwards from the hills on the east of Edwah. The\r\nartificial bank begins at Edwah and runs west, but it is joined at\r\nEdwah to this natural ridge.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Dr. Schweinfurth includes the Edwah-Biahmu bank and the\r\nMinia wall under the expression “dams.”]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Probably that of Fra Mauro, of 1459 A.D., which, as Mr.\r\nCope Whitehouse states, in a paper published in Paris, represents two\r\nsmall lakes unnamed, of which that on the south is larger than that on\r\nthe north.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See map at end.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Mr. Petrie’s information is incorrect on this point. The\r\nquay at its upper end is at R.L. 25·438, as ascertained by careful\r\nlevelling and check-levelling in May 1892, made by Mr. W. O. Joseph and\r\nM. Pini, under my directions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: A feddan = 4200 square metres.]",
