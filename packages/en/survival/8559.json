If he at that time had\r\nbeen able to add that it was also possible to roll such steel into a\r\nfinished bar with no further expenditure of fuel, then undoubtedly the\r\nsurprise would have been much greater.\r\n\r\nEven this, however, has come to pass; and the author of this paper\r\nis now pleased to be able to inform this meeting that it is not only\r\npossible, but that it is extremely easy and practical, by the means to\r\nbe described, to roll a steel ingot into, say, a bloom, a rail, or other\r\nfinished article with its own initial heat, without the aid of the\r\nhitherto universally adopted heating furnace.\r\n\r\nIt is well understood that in the fluid steel poured into the mould\r\nthere is a larger store of heat than is required for the purpose\r\nof rolling or hammering. Not only is there the mere apparent high\r\ntemperature of fluid steel, but there is the store of latent heat in\r\nthis fluid metal which is given out when solidification takes place.\r\n\r\nIt has, no doubt, suggested itself to many that this heat of the ingot\r\nought to be utilized, and as a matter of fact, there have been, at\r\nvarious times and in different places, attempts made to do so; but\r\nhitherto all such attempts have proved failures, and a kind of settled\r\nconviction has been established in the steel trade that the theory could\r\nnot possibly be carried out in practice.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty arose from the fact that a steel ingot when newly\r\nstripped is far too hot in the interior for the purpose of rolling, and\r\nif it be kept long enough for the interior to become in a fit state,\r\nthen the exterior gets far too cold to enable it to be rolled\r\nsuccessfully. It has been attempted to overcome this difficulty\r\nby putting the hot ingots under shields or hoods, lined with\r\nnon-heat-conducting material, and to bury them in non-heat-conducting\r\nmaterial in a pulverized state, for the purpose of retaining and\r\nequalizing the heat; but all these attempts have proved futile in\r\npractice, and the fact remains, that the universal practice in steel\r\nworks at the present day all over the world is to employ a heating\r\nfurnace of some description requiring fuel.\r\n\r\nThe author introduced his new mode of treating ingots at the Darlington\r\nSteel and Iron Company's Works, in Darlington, early in June this year,\r\nand they are now blooming the whole of their make, about 125 tons a\r\nshift, or about 300 ingots every twelve hours, by such means.\r\n\r\nThe machinery at Darlington is not adapted for rolling off in one heat;\r\nnevertheless they have rolled off direct from the ingot treated in the\r\n\"soaking pits\" a considerable number of double-head rails; and the\r\nexperience so gained proves conclusively that with proper machinery\r\nthere will be no difficulty in doing so regularly. The quality of the\r\nrails so rolled off has been everything that could be desired; and as\r\nmany of the defects in rails originate in the heating furnace, the\r\nauthor ventures to predict that even in this respect the new process\r\nwill stand the test.\r\n\r\nMany eminently practical men have witnessed the operation at Darlington,\r\nand they one and all have expressed their great surprise at the result,\r\nand at the simple and original means by which it is accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe process is in course of adoption in several works, both in England\r\nand abroad, and the author hopes that by the time this paper is being\r\nread, there may be some who will from personal experience be able to\r\ntestify to the practicability and economy of the process, which is\r\ncarried out in the manner now to be described.\r\n\r\nA number of upright pits (the number, say, of the ingots in a cast) are\r\nbuilt in a mass of brickwork sunk in the ground below the level of the\r\nfloor, such pits in cross-section being made slightly larger than that\r\nof the ingot, just enough to allow for any fins at the bottom, and\r\nsomewhat deeper than the longest ingot likely to be used. In practice\r\nthe cross section of the pit is made about 3 in. larger than the large\r\nend of the ingot, and the top of the ingot may be anything from 6 in. to\r\n18 in. below the top of the pit. These pits are commanded by an ingot\r\ncrane, by preference so placed in relation to the blooming mill that the\r\ncrane also commands the live rollers of the mill.\r\n\r\nEach pit is covered with a separate lid at the floor level, and after\r\nhaving been well dried and brought to a red heat by the insertion of hot\r\ningots, they are ready for operation.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ingots are stripped (and they should be stripped as early\r\nas practicable), they are transferred one by one, and placed separately\r\nby means of the crane into these previously heated pits (which the\r\nauthor calls \"soaking pits\") and forthwith covered over with the lid,\r\nwhich practically excludes the air. In these pits, thus covered, the\r\ningots are allowed to stand and soak; that is, the excessive molten\r\nheat of the interior, and any additional heat rendered sensible during\r\ncomplete solidification, but which was latent at the time of placing\r\nthe ingots into the pit, becomes uniformly distributed, or nearly so,\r\nthroughout the metallic mass. No, or comparatively little, heat being\r\nable to escape, as the ingot is surrounded by brick walls as hot as\r\nitself, it follows that the surface heat of the ingot is greatly\r\nincreased; and after the space of from twenty to thirty minutes,\r\naccording to circumstances, the ingot is lifted out of the pit\r\napparently much hotter than it went in, and is now swung round to the\r\nrolls, by means of the crane, in a perfect state of heat for rolling,\r\nwith this additional advantage to the mill over an ingot heated in an\r\nordinary furnace from a comparatively cold, that it is always certain to\r\nbe at least as hot in the center as it is on the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nEvery ingot, when cast, contains within itself a considerably larger\r\nstore of heat than is necessary for the rolling operation. Some of this\r\nheat is, of course, lost by passing into the mould, some is lost by\r\nradiation before the ingot enters into the soaking pit, and some is lost\r\nafter it enters, by being conducted away by the brickwork; but in the\r\nordinary course of working, when there is no undue loss of time in\r\ntransferring the ingots, after allowing for this loss, there remains a\r\nsurplus, which goes into the brickwork of the soaking pits, so that this\r\nsurplus of heat from successive ingots tends continually to keep the\r\npits at the intense heat of the ingot itself. Thus, occasionally it\r\nhappens that inadvertently an ingot is delayed so long on its way to the\r\npit as to arrive there somewhat short of heat, its temperature will be\r\nraised by heat from the walls of the pit itself; the refractory mass\r\nwherein the pit is formed, in fact, acting as an accumulator of heat,\r\ngiving and taking heat as required to carry on the operation in a\r\ncontinuous and practical manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GJERS' SOAKING PITS FOR STEEL INGOTS.]\r\n\r\nDuring the soaking operation a quantity of gas exudes from the ingot and\r\nfills the pit, thus entirely excluding atmospheric air from entering;\r\nthis is seen escaping round the lid, and when the lid is removed\r\ncombustion takes place.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by analyses given hereinafter that this gas is entirely\r\ncomposed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbonic oxide, so that the ingots\r\nsoak in a perfectly non-oxidizing medium. Hence loss of steel by\r\noxidation does not take place, and consequently the great loss of\r\nyield which always occurs in the ordinary heating furnace is entirely\r\nobviated.\r\n\r\nThe author does not think it necessary to dilate upon the economical\r\nadvantages of his process, as they are apparent to every practical man\r\nconnected with the manufacture of steel.\r\n\r\nThe operation of steel making on a large scale will by this process be\r\nvery much simplified. It will help to dispense with a large number of\r\nmen, some of them highly paid, directly and indirectly connected with\r\nthe heating department; it will do away with costly heating furnaces and\r\ngas generators, and their costly maintenance; it will save all the coal\r\nused in heating; and what is perhaps of still more importance, it will\r\nsave the loss in yield of steel; and there will be no more steel spoiled\r\nby overheating in the furnaces.\r\n\r\nThe process has been in operation too short a time to give precise\r\nand reliable figures, but it is hoped that by the next meeting of the\r\nInstitute these will be forthcoming from various quarters.\r\n\r\nReferring to the illustrations annexed, Fig. 1 shows sectional\r\nelevation, and Fig. 2 plan of a set of eight soaking pits (marked\r\nA). These pits are built in a mass of brickwork, B, on a concrete\r\nfoundation, C; the ingots, D, standing upright in the pits. The pits are\r\nlined with firebrick lumps, 6 in. thick, forming an independent lining,\r\nE, which at any time can be readily renewed. F is a cast iron plate,\r\nmade to take in four pits, and dropped loosely within the large plate,\r\nG, which surrounds the pits. H is the cover, with a firebrick lining;\r\nand I is a false cover of firebrick, 1 in. smaller than the cross\r\nsection of the pit, put in to rest on the top of the ingot. This false\r\ncover need not necessarily be used, but is useful to keep the extreme\r\ntop of the ingot extra hot. J is the bottom of the pit, composed of\r\nbroken brick and silver sand, forming a good hard bottom at any desired\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nFigs. 4 and 5 show outline plan of two sets of soaking pits, K K, eight\r\neach, placed under a 25 ft. sweep crane, L. This crane, if a good one,\r\ncould handle any ordinary make--up to 2,000 tons per week, and ought to\r\nhave hydraulic racking out and swinging round gear. This crane places\r\nthe ingots into the pits, and, when they are ready, picks them out and\r\nswings them round to blooming mill, M. With such a crane, four men and a\r\nboy at the handles are able to pass the whole of that make through the\r\npits. The author recommends two sets of pits as shown, although one set\r\nof eight pits is quite able to deal with any ordinary output from one\r\nBessemer pit.\r\n\r\nIn case of an extraordinarily large output, the author recommends a\r\nsecond crane, F, for the purpose of placing the ingots in the pits\r\nonly, the crane, L, being entirely used for picking the ingots out\r\nand swinging them round to the live rollers of the mill. The relative\r\nposition of the cranes, soaking pits, and blooming mill may of course be\r\nvariously arranged according to circumstances, and the soaking pits may\r\nbe arranged in single or more rows, or concentrically with the crane at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nFigs. 4 and 5 also show outline plan and elevation of a Bessemer plant,\r\nconveniently arranged for working on the soaking pit system. A A are\r\nthe converters, with a transfer crane, B. C is the casting pit with\r\nits crane, D. E E are the two ingot cranes. F is a leading crane which\r\ntransfers the ingots from the ingot cranes to the soaking pits, K K,\r\ncommanded by the crane, L, which transfers the prepared ingots to the\r\nmill, M. as before described.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERING BY COMPRESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nL. Clemandot has devised a new method of treating metals, especially\r\nsteel, which consists in heating to a cherry red, compressing strongly\r\nand keeping up the pressure until the metal is completely cooled. The\r\nresults are so much like those of tempering that he calls his process\r\ntempering by compression. The compressed metal becomes exceedingly hard,\r\nacquiring a molecular contraction and a fineness of grain such that\r\npolishing gives it the appearance of polished nickel. Compressed steel,\r\nlike tempered steel, acquires the coercitive force which enables it to\r\nabsorb magnetism. This property should be studied in connection with\r\nits durability; experiments have already shown that there is no loss of\r\nmagnetism at the expiration of three months. This compression has no\r\nanalogue but tempering. Hammering and hardening modify the molecular\r\nstate of metals, especially when they are practiced upon metal that is\r\nnearly cold, but the effect of hydraulic pressure is much greater.\r\nThe phenomena which are produced in both methods of tempering may be\r\ninterpreted in different ways, but it seems likely that there is a\r\nmolecular approximation, an amorphism from which results the homogeneity\r\nthat is due to the absence of crystallization. Being an operation which\r\ncan be measured, it may be graduated and kept within limits which are\r\nprescribed in advance; directions may be given to temper at a\r\nspecified pressure, as readily as to work under a given pressure of\r\nsteam.--_Chron. Industr_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMICAL STEAM POWER.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A paper read by title at a recent stated meeting of the\r\nFranklin Institute]\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM BARNET LE VAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most economical application of steam power can be realized only by\r\na judicious arrangement of the plant: namely, the engines, boilers, and\r\ntheir accessories for transmission.\r\n\r\nThis may appear a somewhat broad assertion; but it is nevertheless one\r\nwhich is amply justified by facts open to the consideration of all those\r\nwho choose to seek for them.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that occasionally a factory, mill, or a water-works\r\nmay be found in which the whole arrangements have been planned by a\r\ncompetent engineer, yet such is the exception and not the rule, and such\r\nexamples form but a very small percentage of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that but few users of steam power are aware of the numerous\r\nitems which compose the cost of economical steam power, while a yet\r\nsmaller number give sufficient consideration to the relations which\r\nthese items bear to each other, or the manner in which the economy of\r\nany given boiler or engine is affected by the circumstances under which\r\nit is run.\r\n\r\nA large number of persons--and they are those who should know better,\r\ntoo--take for granted that a boiler or engine which is good for one\r\nsituation is good for all; a greater error than such an assumption can\r\nscarcely be imagined.\r\n\r\nIt is true that there are certain classes of engines and boilers which\r\nmay be relied upon to give moderately good results in almost any\r\nsituation--and the best results should _always_ be desired in\r\narrangement of a mill--there are a considerable number of details which\r\nmust be taken into consideration in making a choice of boilers and\r\nengines.\r\n\r\nTake the case of a mill in which it has been supposed that the motive\r\npower could be best exerted by a single engine. The question now is\r\nwhether or not it would be best to divide the total power required among\r\na number of engines.\r\n\r\n_First_.--A division of the motive power presents the following\r\nadvantages, namely, a saving of expense on lines of shafting of large\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n_Second_.--Dispensing with the large driving belt or gearing, the first\r\nnamed of which, in one instance under the writer's observation, absorbed\r\n_sixty horse-power_ out of about 480, or about _seven per cent_.\r\n\r\n_Third_.--The general convenience of subdividing the work to be done,\r\nso that in case of a stoppage of one portion of the work by reason of\r\na loose coupling or the changing of a pulley, etc., that portion only\r\nwould need to be stopped.\r\n\r\nThis last is of itself a most important point, and demands careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nFor example, I was at a mill a short time ago when the governor belt\r\nbroke. The result was a stoppage of the whole mill. Had the motive power\r\nof this mill been subdivided into a number of small engines only one\r\ndepartment would have been stopped. During the stoppage in this case\r\nthe windows of the mill were a sea of heads of men and women (the\r\noperatives), and considerable excitement was caused by the violent\r\nblowing off of steam from the safety-valves, due to the stoppage of the\r\nsteam supply to the engine; and this excitement continued until the\r\ncause of the stoppage was understood. Had the power in this mill been\r\nsubdivided the stoppage of one of a number of engines would scarcely\r\nhave been noticed, and the blowing off of surplus steam would not have\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nIn building a mill the first item to be considered is the interest on\r\nthe first cost of the engine, boilers, etc. This item can be subdivided\r\nwith advantage into the amounts of interest on the respective costs of,\r\n\r\n_First_. The engine or engines;\r\n\r\n_Second_ The boiler or boilers;\r\n\r\n_Third_. The engine and boiler house.\r\n\r\nIn the same connection the _form_ of engine to be used must be\r\nconsidered. In some few cases--as, for instance, where engines have to\r\nbe placed in confined situations--the form is practically fixed by the\r\nspace available, it being perhaps possible only to erect a vertical or a\r\nhorizontal engine, as the case may be. These, however, are exceptional\r\ninstances, and in most cases--at all events where large powers are\r\nrequired--the engineer may have a free choice in the matter. Under\r\nthese circumstances the best form, in the vast majority of cases where\r\nmachinery must be driven, is undoubtedly the horizontal engine, and the\r\nworst the beam engine. When properly constructed, the horizontal engine\r\nis more durable than the beam engine, while, its first cost being less,\r\nit can be driven at a higher speed, and it involves a much smaller\r\noutlay for engine house and foundations than the latter. In many\r\nrespects the horizontal engine is undoubtedly closely approached in\r\nadvantages by the best forms of vertical engines; but on the whole we\r\nconsider that where machinery is to be driven the balance of advantages\r\nis decidedly in favor of the former class, and particularly so in the\r\ncase of large powers.\r\n\r\nThe next point to be decided is, whether a condensing or non-condensing\r\nengine should be employed. In settling this question not only the\r\nrespective first costs of the two classes of engines must be taken into\r\nconsideration, but also the cost of water and fuel. Excepting, perhaps,\r\nin cases of very small powers, and in those instances where the exhaust\r\nsteam from a non-condensing engine can be turned to good account for\r\nheating or drying purpose, it may safely be asserted that in all\r\ninstances where a sufficient supply of condensing water is available\r\nat a moderate cost, the extra economy of a well-constructed condensing\r\nengine will fully warrant the additional outlay involved in its\r\npurchase. In these days of high steam pressures, a well constructed\r\nnon-condensing engine can, no doubt, be made to approximate closely to\r\nthe economy of a condensing engine, but in such a case the extra cost of\r\nthe stronger boiler required will go far to balance the additional cost\r\nof the condensing engine.\r\n\r\nHaving decided on the form, the next question is, what \"class\" of engine\r\nshall it be; and by the term class I mean the relative excellence of the\r\nengine as a power-producing machine. An automatic engine costs more than\r\na plain slide-valve engine, but it will depend upon the cost of fuel at\r\nthe location where the engine is to be placed, and the number of hours\r\nper day it is kept running, to decide which class of machine can be\r\nadopted with the greatest economy to the proprietor. The cost of\r\nlubricating materials, fuel, repairs, and percentage of cost to be put\r\naside for depreciation, will be less in case of the high-class than in\r\nthe low-class engine, while the former will also require less boiler\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAgainst these advantages are to be set the greater first cost of the\r\nautomatic engine, and the consequent annual charge due to capital sunk.\r\nThese several items should all be fairly estimated when an engine is\r\nto be bought, and the kind chosen accordingly. Let us take the item of\r\nfuel, for instance, and let us suppose this fuel to cost four dollars\r\nper ton at the place where the engine is run. Suppose the engine to be\r\ncapable of developing one hundred horse-power, and that it consumes five\r\npounds of coal per hour per horse-power, and runs ten hours per day:\r\nthis would necessitate the supply of two and one-half tons per day at\r\na cost of ten dollars per day. To be really economical, therefore, any\r\nimprovement which would effect a saving of one pound of coal per hour\r\nper horse-power must not cost a greater sum per horse-power than that on\r\nwhich the cost of the difference of the coal saved (one pound of coal\r\nper hour per horse-power, which would be 1,000 pounds per day) for, say,\r\nthree hundred days, three hundred thousand (300,000) pounds, or one\r\nhundred and fifty tons (or six hundred dollars), would pay a fair\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the mill owner estimates his capital as worth to him ten\r\nper cent, per annum, then the improvement which would effect the above\r\nmentioned saving must not cost more than six thousand dollars, and so\r\non. If, instead of being run only ten hours per day, the engine is run\r\nnight and day, then the outlay which it would be justifiable to make to\r\neffect a certain saving per hour would be doubled; while, on the other\r\nhand, if an engine is run less than the usual time per day a given\r\nsaving per hour would justify a correspondingly less outlay.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that for grain and other elevators, which are not run\r\nconstantly, gas engines, although costing more for the same power,\r\nare cheaper than steam engines for elevating purposes where only\r\noccasionally used.\r\n\r\nFor this reason it is impossible without considerable investigation to\r\nsay what is really the most economical engine to adopt in any particular\r\ncase; and as comparatively few users of steam power care to make this\r\ninvestigation a vast amount of wasteful expenditure results. Although,\r\nhowever, no absolute rule can be given, we may state that the number\r\nof instances in which an engine which is wasteful of fuel can be used\r\nprofitably is exceedingly small. As a rule, in fact, it may generally be\r\nassumed that an engine employed for driving a manufactory of any kind\r\ncannot be of too high a class, the saving effected by the economical\r\nworking of such engines in the vast majority of cases enormously\r\noutweighing the interest on their extra first cost. So few people appear\r\nto have a clear idea of the vast importance of economy of fuel in mills\r\nand factories that I perhaps cannot better conclude than by giving an\r\nexample showing the saving to be effected in a large establishment by an\r\neconomical engine.\r\n\r\nI will take the case of a flouring mill in this city which employed two\r\nengines that required forty pounds of water to be converted into steam\r\nper hour per indicated horse-power. This, at the time, was considered a\r\nmoderate amount and the engines were considered \"good.\"\r\n\r\nThese engines indicated seventy horse power each, and ran twenty-four\r\nhours per day on an average of three hundred days each year, requiring\r\nas per indicator diagrams forty million three hundred and twenty\r\nthousand pounds (40 x 70 x 24 x 300 x 2 = 40,320,000) of feed water to\r\nbe evaporated per annum, which, in Philadelphia, costs three dollars\r\nper horse-power per annum, amounting to (70 x 2 x 300 = $420.00) four\r\nhundred and twenty dollars.\r\n\r\nThe coal consumed averaged five and one-half pounds per hour per\r\nhorse-power, which, at four dollars per ton, costs\r\n\r\n((70 x 2 x 5.5 x 24 x 300) / 2,000) x 4.00= $11,088\r\n\r\nEleven thousand and eighty-eight dollars.\r\n\r\n  Cost of coal for 300 days.                $11,088\r\n  Cost of water for 300 days.                   420\r\n                                            -------\r\n  Total cost of coal and water.             $11,503\r\n\r\nThese engines were replaced by one first-class automatic engine,\r\nwhich developed one hundred and forty-two horse-power per hour with a\r\nconsumption of _three pounds_ of coal per hour per horse-power, and the\r\nindicator diagrams showed a consumption of _thirty_ pounds of water per\r\nhour per horse-power. Coal cost\r\n\r\n((142 x 3 x 24 x 300) / 2,000) x 4.00 = $6,134\r\n\r\nSix thousand one hundred and thirty-four dollars. Water cost (142 x\r\n3.00= $426.00) four hundred and twenty-six dollars.\r\n\r\n  Cost of coal for 300 days.                $6,134\r\n  Cost of water for 300 days.                  426\r\n                                            ------\r\n  Total cost of coal and water.             $6,560\r\n\r\nThe water evaporated in the latter case to perform the same work was\r\n(142 x 30 x 24 x 300 = 30,672,000) thirty million six hundred and\r\nseventy-two thousand pounds of feed water against (40,320,000) forty\r\nmillion three hundred and twenty thousand pounds in the former, a saving\r\nof (9,648,000) nine million six hundred and forty-eight thousand pounds\r\nper annum; or,\r\n\r\n(40,320,000 - 30,672,000) / 9,648,000 = 31.4 per cent.\r\n\r\n--_thirty-one and four-tenths per cent_.\r\n\r\nAnd a saving in coal consumption of\r\n\r\n(11,088 - 6,134) / 4,954 = 87.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n--_eighty-seven and one-half per cent_., or a saving in dollars and\r\ncents of four thousand nine hundred and fifty-four dollars ($4,954).\r\n\r\nIn this city, Philadelphia, no allowance for the consumption of water is\r\nmade in the case of first class engines, such engines being charged the\r\nsame rate per annum per horse-power as an inferior engine, while,\r\nas shown by the above example, a saving in water of _thirty-one and\r\nfour-tenths per cent_. has been attained by the employment of a\r\nfirst-class engine. The builders of such engines will always give a\r\nguarantee of their consumption of water, so that the purchaser can be\r\nable in advance to estimate this as accurately as he can the amount of\r\nfuel he will use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVER IMPROVEMENTS NEAR ST. LOUIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the Mississippi River near St. Louis progresses\r\nsatisfactorily. The efficacy of the jetty system is illustrated in the\r\nlines of mattresses which showed accumulations of sand deposits ranging\r\nfrom the surface of the river to nearly sixteen feet in height. At Twin\r\nHollow, thirteen miles from St. Louis and six miles from Horse-Tail Bar,\r\nthere was found a sand bar extending over the widest portion of the\r\nriver on which the engineering forces were engaged. Hurdles are built\r\nout from the shore to concentrate the stream on the obstruction, and\r\nthen to protect the river from widening willows are interwoven between\r\nthe piles. At Carroll's Island mattresses 125 feet wide have been\r\nplaced, and the banks revetted with stone from ordinary low water to a\r\n16 foot stage. There is plenty of water over the bar, and at the most\r\nshallow points the lead showed a depth of twelve feet. Beard's Island, a\r\nshort distance further, is also being improved, the largest force of men\r\nat any one place being here engaged. Four thousand feet of mattresses\r\nhave been begun, and in placing them work will be vigorously prosecuted\r\nuntil operations are suspended by floating ice. The different sections\r\nare under the direction of W. F. Fries, resident engineer, and E. M.\r\nCurrie, superintending engineer. There are now employed about 1,200 men,\r\nthirty barges and scows, two steam launches, and the stern-wheel steamer\r\nA. A. Humphreys. The improvements have cost, in actual money expended,\r\nabout $200,000, and as the appropriation for the ensuing year\r\napproximates $600,000, the prospect of a clear channel is gratifying to\r\nthose interested in the river.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUNTE'S BURETTE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF FURNACE GASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor analyzing the gases of blast-furnaces the various apparatus of Orsat\r\nhave long been employed; but, by reason of its simplicity, the burette\r\ndevised by Dr. Bünte, and shown in the accompanying figures, is much\r\neasier to use. Besides, it permits of a much better and more rapid\r\nabsorption of the oxide of carbon; and yet, for the lost fractions of\r\nthe latter, it is necessary to replace a part of the absorbing liquid\r\nthree or four times. The absorbing liquid is prepared by making a\r\nsaturated solution of chloride of copper in hydrochloric acid, and\r\nadding thereto a small quantity of dissolved chloride of tin. Afterward,\r\nthere are added to the decanted mixture a few spirals of red copper, and\r\nthe mixture is then carefully kept from contact with the air.\r\n\r\nTo fill the burette with gas, the three-way cock, _a_, is so placed that\r\nthe axial aperture shall be in communication with the graduated part, A,\r\nof the burette. After this, water is poured into the funnel, t, and the\r\nburette is put in communication with the gas reservoir by means of a\r\nrubber tube. The lower point of the burette is put in communication with\r\na rubber pump, V (Fig. 2), on an aspirator (the cock, _b_, being left\r\nopen), and the gas is sucked in until all the air that was in the\r\napparatus has been expelled from it. The cocks, _a_ and _b_, are turned\r\n90 degrees. The water in the funnel prevents the gases communicating\r\nwith the top. The point of the three-way cock is afterward closed with a\r\nrubber tube and glass rod.\r\n\r\nIf the gas happens to be in the reservoir of an aspirator, it is made\r\nto pass into the apparatus in the following manner: The burette is\r\ncompletely filled with water, and the point of the three-way cock is\r\nput in communication with a reservoir. If the gas is under pressure, a\r\nportion of it is allowed to escape through the capillary tube into the\r\nwater in the funnel, by turning the cock, _a_, properly, and thus all\r\nthe water in the conduit is entirely expelled. Afterward _a_ is turned\r\n180°, and the lower cock, _b_, is opened. While the water is flowing\r\nthrough _b_, the burette becomes filled with gas.\r\n\r\n_Mode of Measuring the Gases and Absorption_.--The tube that\r\ncommunicates with the vessel, F, is put in communication, after the\r\nlatter has been completely filled with water, with the point of the\r\ncock, _b_ (Fig. 2). Then the latter is opened, as is also the pinch cock\r\non the rubber tubing, and water is allowed to enter the burette through\r\nthe bottom until the level is at the zero of the graduation. There are\r\nthen 100 cubic centimeters in the burette. The superfluous gas has\r\nescaped through the cock, _a_, and passed through the water in the\r\nfunnel. The cock, _a_, is afterward closed by turning it 90°. To\r\ncause the absorbing liquid to pass into the burette, the water in the\r\ngraduated cylinder is made to flow by connecting the rubber tube, s, of\r\nthe bottle, S, with the point of the burette. The cock is opened, and\r\nsuction is effected with the mouth of the tube, r. When the water has\r\nflowed out to nearly the last drop, _b_ is closed and the suction bottle\r\nis removed. The absorbing liquid (caustic potassa or pyrogallate of\r\npotassa) is poured into a porcelain capsule, P, and the point of the\r\nburette is dipped into the liquid. If the cock, _b_, be opened, the\r\nabsorbing liquid will be sucked into the burette. In order to hasten\r\nthe absorption, the cock, _b_, is closed, and the burette is shaken\r\nhorizontally, the aperture of the funnel being closed by the hand during\r\nthe operation.\r\n\r\nIf not enough absorbing liquid has entered, there may be sucked into the\r\nburette, by the process described above, a new quantity of liquid. The\r\nreaction finished, the graduated cylinder is put in communication with\r\nthe funnel by turning the cock, _a_. The water is allowed to run from\r\nthe funnel, and the latter is filled again with water up to the mark.\r\nThe gas is then again under the same pressure as at the beginning.\r\n\r\nAfter the level has become constant, the quantity of gas remaining is\r\nmeasured. The contraction that has taken place gives, in hundredths of\r\nthe total volume, the volume of the gas absorbed.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to make an analysis of smoke due to combustion,\r\ncaustic potassa is first sucked into the burette. After complete\r\nabsorption, and after putting the gas at the same pressure, the\r\ndiminution gives the volume of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nTo determine the oxygen in the remaining gas, a portion of the caustic\r\npotash is allowed to flow out, and an aqueous solution of pyrogallic\r\nacid and potash is allowed to enter. The presence of oxygen is revealed\r\nby the color of the liquid, which becomes darker.\r\n\r\nThe gas is then agitated with the absorbing liquid until, upon opening\r\nthe cock, _a_, the liquid remains in the capillary tube, that is to say,\r\nuntil no more water runs from the funnel into the burette. To make a\r\nquantitative analysis of the carbon contained in gas, the pyrogallate of\r\npotash must be entirely removed from the burette. To do this, the liquid\r\nis sucked out by means of the flask, S, until there remain only a few\r\ndrops; then the cock, _a_, is opened and water is allowed to flow from\r\nthe funnel along the sides of the burette. Then _a_ is closed, and\r\nthe washing water is sucked in the same manner. By repeating this\r\nmanipulation several times, the absorbing liquid is completely removed.\r\nThe acid solution of chloride of copper is then allowed to enter.\r\n\r\nAs the absorbing liquids adhere to the glass, it is better, before\r\nnoting the level, to replace these liquids by water. The cocks, _a_ and\r\n_b_, are opened, and water is allowed to enter from the funnel, the\r\nabsorbing liquid being made to flow at the same time through the cock,\r\n_b_.\r\n\r\nWhen an acid solution of chloride of copper is employed, dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid is used instead of water.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 shows the arrangement of the apparatus for the quantitative\r\nanalysis of oxide of carbon and hydrogen by combustion. The gas in the\r\nburette is first mixed with atmospheric air, by allowing the liquid to\r\nflow through _b_, and causing air to enter through the axial aperture of\r\nthe three way cock, _a_, after cutting off communication at v. Then, as\r\nshown in the figure, the burette is connected with the tube, B, which is\r\nfilled with water up to the narrow curved part, and the interior of the\r\nburette is made to communicate with the combustion tube, v, by turning\r\nthe cock, a. The combustion tube is heated by means of a Bunsen burner\r\nor alcohol lamp, L. It is necessary to proceed, so that all the water\r\nshall be driven from the cock and the capillary tube, and that it shall\r\nbe sent into the burette. The combustion is effected by causing the\r\nmixture of gas to pass from the burette into the tube, B, through the\r\ntube, v, heated to redness, into which there passes a palladium wire.\r\nWater is allowed to flow through the point of the tube, B, while from\r\nthe flask, F, it enters through the bottom into the burette, so as to\r\ndrive out the gas. The water is allowed to rise into the burette as far\r\nas the cock, and the cocks, _b_ and _b¹_, are afterward closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. BÜNTE'S GAS BURETTE]\r\n\r\nBy a contrary operation, the gas is made to pass from B into the\r\nburette. It is then allowed to cool, and, after the pressure has been\r\nestablished again, the contraction is measured. If the gas burned is\r\nhydrogen, the contraction multiplied by two-thirds gives the original\r\nvolume of the hydrogen gas burned. If the gas burned is oxide of carbon,\r\nthere forms an equal volume of carbonic acid, and the contraction is the\r\nhalf of CO. Thus, to analyze CO, a portion of the liquid is removed from\r\nthe burette, then caustic potash is allowed to enter, and the process\r\ngoes on as explained above.\r\n\r\nThe total contraction resulting from combustion and absorption,\r\nmultiplied by two-thirds, gives the volume of the oxide of carbon.\r\n\r\nThe hydrogen and oxide carbon may thus be quantitatively analyzed\r\ntogether or separately.--_Revue Industrielle_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"UNIVERSAL\" GAS ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engravings illustrate a new and very simple form of gas\r\nengine, the invention of J. A. Ewins and H. Newman, and made by Mr. T.\r\nB. Barker, of Scholefield-street, Bloomsbury, Birmingham. It is known as\r\nthe \"Universal\" engine, and is at present constructed in sizes varying\r\nfrom one-eighth horse-power--one man power--to one horse-power, though\r\nlarger sizes are being made. The essentially new feature of the engine\r\nis, says the _Engineer_, the simple rotary ignition valve consisting of\r\na ratchet plate or flat disk with a number of small radial slots which\r\nsuccessively pass a small slot in the end of the cylinder, and through\r\nwhich the flame is drawn to ignite the charge. In our illustrations Fig.\r\n1 is a side elevation; Fig. 2 an end view of same; Fig. 3 a plan; Fig. 4\r\nis a sectional view of the chamber in which the gas and air are mixed,\r\nwith the valves appertaining thereto; Fig. 5 is a detail view of the\r\nratchet plate, with pawl and levers and valve gear shaft; Fig. 6 is\r\na sectional view of a pump employed in some cases to circulate water\r\nthrough the jacket; Fig. 7 is a sectional view of arrangement for\r\nlighting, and ratchet plate, j, with central spindle and igniting\r\napertures, and the spiral spring, k, and fly nut, showing the attachment\r\nto the end of the working cylinder, f1; b5, b5, bevel wheels driving\r\nthe valve gear shaft; e, the valve gear driving shaft; e2, eccentric to\r\ndrive pump; e³, eccentric or cam to drive exhaust valve; e4, crank to\r\ndrive ratchet plate; e5, connecting rod to ratchet pawl; f, cylinder\r\njacket; f1, internal or working cylinder; f2, back cylinder cover; g,\r\nigniting chamber; h, mixing chamber; h1, flap valve; h2, gas inlet\r\nvalve, the motion of which is regulated by a governor; h3, gas inlet\r\nvalve seat; h4, cover, also forming stop for gas inlet valve; h5, gas\r\ninlet pipe; h6, an inlet valve; h8, cover, also forming stop for air\r\ninlet valve; h9, inlet pipe for air with grating; i, exhaust chamber;\r\ni2, exhaust valve spindle; i7, exhaust pipe; j6, lighting aperture\r\nthrough cylinder end; l, igniting gas jet; m, regulating and stop valve\r\nfor gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED GAS ENGINE]\r\n\r\nThe engine, it will be seen, is single-acting, and no compression of the\r\nexplosive charge is employed. An explosive mixture of combustible gas\r\nand air is drawn through the valves, h2 and h6, and exploded behind\r\nthe piston once in a revolution; but by a duplication of the valve and\r\nigniting apparatus, placed also at the front end of the cylinder, the\r\nengine may be constructed double-acting. At the proper time, when the\r\npiston has proceeded far enough to draw in through the mixing chamber,\r\nh, into the igniting chamber, g, the requisite amount of gas and air,\r\nthe ratchet plate, j, is pushed into such a position by the pawl, j3,\r\nthat the flame from the igniting jet, l, passes through one of the slots\r\nor holes, j1, and explodes the charge when opposite j6, which is the\r\nonly aperture in the end of the working cylinder (see Fig. 7 and Fig.\r\n2), thus driving the piston on to the end of its forward stroke. The\r\nexhaust valve, Fig. 9, though not exactly of the form shown, is kept\r\nopen during the whole of this return stroke by means of the eccentric,\r\ne3, on the shaft working the ratchet, and thus allowing the products of\r\ncombustion to escape through the exhaust pipe, i7, in the direction of\r\nthe arrow. Between the ratchet disk and the igniting flame a small plate\r\nnot shown is affixed to the pipe, its edge being just above the burner\r\ntop. The flame is thus not blown out by the inrushing air when the slots\r\nin ratchet plate and valve face are opposite. This ratchet plate or\r\nignition valve, the most important in any engine, has so very small a\r\nrange of motion per revolution of the engine that it cannot get out of\r\norder, and it appears to require no lubrication or attention whatever.\r\nThe engines are working very successfully, and their simplicity enables\r\nthem to be made at low cost. They cost for gas from ½d. to 1½d. per hour\r\nfor the sizes mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.9.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS FURNACE FOR BAKING REFRACTORY PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that small establishments may put to profit the advantages\r\nderived from the use of annular furnaces heated with gas, smaller\r\ndimensions have been given the baking chambers of such furnaces. The\r\naccompanying figure gives a section of a furnace of this kind, set into\r\nthe ground, and the height of whose baking chamber is only one and a\r\nhalf meters. The chamber is not vaulted, but is covered by slabs of\r\nrefractory clay, D, that may be displaced by the aid of a small car\r\nrunning on a movable track. This car is drawn over the compartment that\r\nis to be emptied, and the slab or cover, D, is taken off and carried\r\nover the newly filled compartment and deposited thereon.\r\n\r\nThe gas passes from the channel through the pipe, a, into the vertical\r\nconduits, b, and is afterward disengaged through the tuyeres into the\r\nchamber. In order that the gas may be equally applied for preliminary\r\nheating or smoking, a small smoking furnace, S, has been added to\r\nthe apparatus. The upper part of this consists of a wide cylinder\r\nof refractory clay, in the center of whose cover there is placed an\r\ninternal tube of refractory clay, which communicates with the channel,\r\nG, through a pipe, d. This latter leads the gas into the tube, t, of the\r\nsmoking furnace, which is perforated with a large number of small holes.\r\nThe air requisite for combustion enters through the apertures, o, in the\r\ncover of the furnace, and brings about in the latter a high temperature.\r\nThe very hot gases descend into the lower iron portion of this small\r\nfurnace and pass through a tube, e, into the smoking chamber by the aid\r\nof vertical conduits, b', which serve at the same time as gas tuyeres\r\nfor the extremity of the furnace that is exposed to the fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAS FURNACE FOR BAKING REFRACTORY PRODUCTS.]\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the smoking furnace, which is made of boiler plate\r\nand can be put in communication with the tube, e, there are large\r\napertures that may be wholly or partially closed by means of registers\r\nso as to carry to the hot gas derived from combustion any quantity\r\nwhatever of cold and dry air, and thus cause a variation at will of the\r\ntemperature of the gases which are disengaged from the tube, e.\r\n\r\nThe use of these smoking apparatus heated by gas does away also with the\r\ninconveniences of the ordinary system, in which the products are soiled\r\nby cinders or dust, and which render the gradual heating of objects to\r\nbe baked difficult. At the beginning, there is allowed to enter the\r\nlower part of the small furnace, S, through the apertures, a very\r\nconsiderable quantity of cold air, so as to lower the temperature of the\r\nsmoke gas that escapes from the tube, e, to 30 or 50 degrees. Afterward,\r\nthese secondary air entrances are gradually closed so as to increase the\r\ntemperature of the gases at will.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFICIENCY OF FANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAir, like every other gas or combination of gases, possesses weight;\r\nsome persons who have been taught that the air exerts a pressure of 14.7\r\nlb. per square inch, cannot, however, be got to realize the fact that a\r\ncubit foot of air at the same pressure and at a temperature of 62 deg.\r\nweighs the thirteenth part of a pound, or over one ounce; 13.141 cubic\r\nfeet of air weigh one pound. In round numbers 30,000 cubic feet of air\r\nweigh one ton; this is a useful figure to remember, and it is easily\r\ncarried in the mind. A hall 61 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 17 feet high\r\nwill contain one ton of air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nThe work to be done by a fan consists in putting a weight--that of the\r\nair--in motion. The resistances incurred are due to the inertia of the\r\nair and various frictional influences; the nature and amount of these\r\nlast vary with the construction of the fan. As the air enters at the\r\ncenter of the fan and escapes at the circumference, it will be seen that\r\nits motion is changed while in the fan through a right angle. It may\r\nalso be taken for granted that within certain limits the air has no\r\nmotion in a radial direction when it first comes in contact with a fan\r\nblade. It is well understood that, unless power is to be wasted, motion\r\nshould be gradually imparted to any body to be moved. Consequently, the\r\nshape of the blades ought to be such as will impart motion at first\r\nslowly and afterward in a rapidly increasing ratio to the air. It is\r\nalso clear that the change of motion should be effected as gradually as\r\npossible. Fig. 1 shows how a fan should not be constructed; Fig. 2 will\r\nserve to give an idea of how it should be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 1 it will be seen that the air, as indicated by the bent arrows,\r\nis violently deflected on entering the fan. In Fig. 2 it will be seen\r\nthat it follows gentle curves, and so is put gradually in motion. The\r\ncurved form of the blades shown in Fig. 2 does not appear to add much to\r\nthe efficiency of a fan; but it adds something and keeps down noise. The\r\nidea is that the fan blades when of this form push the air radially from\r\nthe center to the circumference. The fact is, however, that the air\r\nflies outward under the influence of centrifugal force, and always tends\r\nto move at a tangent to the fan blades, as in Fig. 3, where the circle\r\nis the path of the tips of the fan blades, and the arrow is a tangent to\r\nthat path; and to impart this notion a radial blade, as at C, is perhaps\r\nas good as any other, as far as efficiency is concerned. Concerning the\r\nshape to be imparted to the blades, looked at back or front, opinions\r\nwidely differ; but it is certain that if a fan is to be silent the\r\nblades must be narrower at the tips than at the center. Various forms\r\nare adopted by different makers, the straight side and the curved sides,\r\nas shown in Fig. 4, being most commonly used. The proportions as regards\r\nlength to breadth are also varied continually. In fact, no two makers of\r\nfans use the same shapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3]\r\n\r\nAs the work done by a fan consists in imparting motion at a stated\r\nvelocity to a given weight of air, it is very easy to calculate the\r\npower which must be expended to do a certain amount of work. The\r\nvelocity at which the air leaves the fan cannot be greater than that of\r\nthe fan tips. In a good fan it may be about two-thirds of that speed.\r\nThe resistance to be overcome will be found by multiplying the area of\r\nthe fan blades by the pressure of the air and by the velocity of the\r\ncenter of effort, which must be determined for every fan according to\r\nthe shape of its blades. The velocity imparted to the air by the fan\r\nwill be just the same as though the air fell in a mass from a given\r\nheight. This height can be found by the formula h = v² / 64; that is to\r\nsay, if the velocity be multiplied by itself and divided by 64 we have\r\nthe height. Thus, let the velocity be 88 per second, then 88 x 88 =\r\n7,744, and 7,744 / 64 = 121. A stone or other body falling from a height\r\nof 121 feet would have a velocity of 88 per second at the earth. The\r\npressure against the fan blades will be equal to that of a column of air\r\nof the height due to the velocity, or, in this case, 121 feet. We\r\nhave seen that in round numbers 13 cubic feet of air weigh one pound,\r\nconsequently a column of air one square foot in section and 121 feet\r\nhigh, will weigh as many pounds as 13 will go times into 121. Now, 121\r\n/ 13 = 9.3, and this will be the resistance in pounds per _square foot_\r\novercome by the fan. Let the aggregate area of all the blades be 2\r\nsquare feet, and the velocity of the center of effort 90 feet per\r\nsecond, then the power expended will bve (90 x 60 x 2 x 9.3) / 33,000\r\n= 3.04 horse power. The quantity of air delivered ought to be equal in\r\nvolume to that of a column with a sectional area equal that of one fan\r\nblade moving at 88 feet per second, or a mile a minute. The blade having\r\nan area of 1 square foot, the delivery ought to be 5,280 feet per\r\nminute, weighing 5,280 / 13 = 406.1 lb. In practice we need hardly say\r\nthat such an efficiency is never attained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4]\r\n\r\nThe number of recorded experiments with fans is very small, and a great\r\ndeal of ignorance exists as to their true efficiency. Mr. Buckle is one\r\nof the very few authorities on the subject.

The case is to be made in the form of an\r\narithmetical spiral widening, the space between the case and the blades\r\nradially from the origin to the opening for discharge, and the upper\r\nedge of the opening should be level with the lower side of the sweep of\r\nthe fan blade, somewhat as shown in Fig. 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\r\n\r\nA considerable number of patents has been taken out for improvements\r\nin the construction of fans, but they all, or nearly all, relate to\r\nmodifications in the form of the case and of the blades. So far,\r\nhowever, as is known, it appears that, while these things do exert a\r\nmarked influence on the noise made by a fan, and modify in some degree\r\nthe efficiency of the machine, that this last depends very much more on\r\nthe proportions adopted than on the shapes--so long as easy curves\r\nare used and sharp angles avoided. In the case of fans running at low\r\nspeeds, it matters very little whether the curves are present or not;\r\nbut at high speeds the case is different.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINE FOR COMPRESSING COAL REFUSE INTO FUEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem as to how the refuse of coal shall be utilized has been\r\nsolved in the manufacture from it of an agglomerated artificial\r\nfuel, which is coming more and more into general use on railways and\r\nsteamboats, in the industries, and even in domestic heating.\r\n\r\nThe qualities that a good agglomerating machine should present are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. Very great simplicity, inasmuch as it is called upon to operate in\r\nan atmosphere charged with coal dust, pitch, and steam; and, under such\r\nconditions, it is important that it may be easily got at for cleaning,\r\nand that the changing of its parts (which wear rapidly) may be effected\r\nwithout, so to speak, interrupting its running.\r\n\r\n2. The compression must be powerful, and, that the product may be\r\nhomogeneous, must operate progressively and not by shocks. It must\r\nespecially act as much as possible upon the entire surface of the\r\nconglomerate, and this is something that most machines fail to do.\r\n\r\n3. The removal from the mould must be effected easily, and not depend\r\nupon a play of pistons or springs, which soon become foul, and the\r\noperation of which is very irregular.\r\n\r\nThe operations embraced in the manufacture of this kind of fuel are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe refuse is sifted in order to separate the dust from the grains of\r\ncoal. The dust is not submitted to a washing. The grains are classed\r\ninto two sizes, after removing the nut size, which is sold separately.\r\nThe grains of each size are washed separately. The washed grains are\r\neither drained or dried by a hydro-extractor in order to free them from\r\nthe greater part of the water, the presence of this being an obstacle to\r\ntheir perfect agglomeration. The water, however, should not be entirely\r\nextracted because the combustibles being poor conductors of heat, a\r\ncertain amount of dampness must be preserved to obtain an equal division\r\nof heat in the paste when the mixture is warmed.\r\n\r\nAfter being dried the grains are mixed with the coal dust, and broken\r\ncoal pitch is added in the proportion of eight to ten per cent. of the\r\ncoal. The mixture is then thrown into a crushing machine, where it is\r\nreduced to powder and intimately mixed. It then passes into a pug-mill\r\ninto which superheated steam is admitted, and by this means is converted\r\ninto a plastic paste. This paste is then led into an agitator for the\r\ndouble purpose of freeing it from the steam that it contains, and of\r\ndistributing it in the moulds of the compressing machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED MACHINE FOR COMPRESSING REFUSE COAL INTO FUEL.]\r\n\r\nBilan's machine, shown in the accompanying cut, is designed for\r\nmanufacturing spherical conglomerates for domestic purposes. It consists\r\nof a cast iron frame supporting four vertical moulding wheels placed at\r\nright angles to each other and tangent to the line of the centers. These\r\nwheels carry on their periphery cavities that have the form of a quarter\r\nof a sphere. They thus form at the point of contact a complete sphere\r\nin which the material is inclosed. The paste is thrown by shovel, or\r\nemptied by buckets and chain, into the hopper fixed at the upper part\r\nof the frame. From here it is taken up by two helices, mounted on a\r\nvertical shaft traversing the hopper, and forced toward the point where\r\nthe four moulding wheels meet. The driving pulley of the machine is\r\nkeyed upon a horizontal shaft which is provided with two endless screws\r\nthat actuate two gear-wheels, and these latter set in motion the four\r\nmoulding wheels by means of beveled pinions. The four moulding wheels\r\nbeing accurately adjusted so that their cavities meet each other at\r\nevery revolution, carry along the paste furnished them by the hopper,\r\ncompress it powerfully on the four quarters, and, separating by a\r\nfurther revolution, allow the finished ball to drop out.\r\n\r\nThe external crown of the wheels carrying the moulds consists of four\r\nsegments, which may be taken apart at will to be replaced by others when\r\nworn.\r\n\r\nThis machine produces about 40 tons per day of this globular artificial\r\nfuel.--_Annales Industrielles_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHANK SIZING AND WRINGING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe give a view of a hank sizing machine by Messrs. Heywood & Spencer,\r\nof Radcliffe, near Manchester. The machine is also suitable for fancy\r\ndyeing. It is well known, says the _Textile Manufacturer_, that when\r\nhanks are wrung by hand, not only is the labor very severe, but in\r\ndyeing it is scarcely possible to obtain even colors, and, furthermore,\r\nthe production is limited by the capabilities of the man. The machine\r\nwe illustrate is intended to perform the heavy part of the work with\r\ngreater expedition and with more certainty than could be relied upon\r\nwith hand labor. The illustration represents the machine that we\r\ninspected. Its construction seems of the simplest character. It consists\r\nof two vats, between which is placed the gearing for driving the hooks.\r\nThe large wheel in this gear, although it always runs in one direction,\r\ncontains internal segments, which fall into gear alternately with\r\npinions on the shanks of the hooks. The motion is a simple one, and it\r\nappeared to us to be perfectly reliable, and not liable to get out of\r\norder. The action is as follows: The attendant lifts the hank out of the\r\nvat and places it on the hooks. The hook connected to the gearing then\r\ncommences to turn; it puts in two, two and a half, three, or more twists\r\ninto the hank and remains stationary for a few seconds to allow an\r\ninterval for the sizer to \"wipe off\" the excess of size, that is, to\r\nrun his hand along the twisted hank. This done, the hook commences to\r\nrevolve the reverse way, until the twists are taken out of the hank.\r\nIt is then removed, either by lifting off by hand or by the apparatus\r\nshown, attached to the right hand side. This arrangement consists of a\r\nlattice, carrying two arms that, at the proper moment, lift the hank off\r\nthe hooks on to the lattice proper, by which it is carried away, and\r\ndropped upon a barrow to be taken to the drying stove. In sizing, a\r\ndouble operation is customary; the first is called running, and the\r\nsecond, finishing. In the machine shown, running is carried on one side\r\nsimultaneously with finishing in the other, or, if required, running\r\nmay be carried on on both sides. If desired, the lifting off motion is\r\nattached to both running and finishing sides, and also the roller partly\r\nseen on the left hand for running the hanks through the size. The\r\nmachine we saw was doing about 600 bundles per day at running and at\r\nfinishing, but the makers claim the production with a double machine to\r\nbe at the rate of about 36 10 lb. bundles per hour (at finishing), wrung\r\nin 1½ lb. wringers (or I½ lb. of yarn at a time), or at running at the\r\nrate of 45 bundles in 2 lb. wringers. The distance between the hooks\r\nis easily adjusted to the length or size of hanks, and altogether the\r\nmachine seems one that is worth the attention of the trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED HANK SIZING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED COKE BREAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe working parts of the breaker now in use by the South Metropolitan\r\nGas Company consist essentially of a drum provided with cutting edges\r\nprojecting from it, which break up the coke against a fixed grid. The\r\ndrum is cast in rings, to facilitate repairs when necessary, and the\r\ncapacity of the machine can therefore be increased or diminished by\r\nvarying the number of these rings. The degree of fineness of the coke\r\nwhen broken is determined by the regulated distance of the grid from the\r\ndrum. Thus there is only one revolving member, no toothed gearing being\r\nrequired. Consequently the machine works with little power; the one at\r\nthe Old Kent Road, which is of the full size for large works, being\r\nactually driven by a one horse power \"Otto\" gas-engine. Under these\r\nconditions, at a recent trial, two tons of coke were broken in half an\r\nhour, and the material delivered screened into the three classes of\r\ncoke, clean breeze (worth as much as the larger coke), and dust, which\r\nat these works is used to mix with lime in the purifiers. The special\r\nadvantage of the machine, besides the low power required to drive it and\r\nits simple action, lies in the small quantity of waste. On the occasion\r\nof the trial in question, the dust obtained from two tons of coke\r\nmeasured only 3½ bushels, or just over a half hundredweight per ton.\r\nThe following statement, prepared from the actual working of the first\r\nmachine constructed, shows the practical results of its use. It should\r\nbe premised that the machine is assumed to be regularly employed and\r\ndriven by the full power for which it is designed, when it will easily\r\nbreak 8 tons of coke per hour, or 80 tons per working day:\r\n\r\n    500 feet of gas consumed by a 2 horse power\r\n      gas-engine, at cost price of gas delivered   s. d.\r\n      in holder.                                   0  9\r\n    Oil and cotton waste.                          0  6\r\n    Two men supplying machine with large\r\n      coke, and shoveling up broken, at 4s.\r\n      6d.                                          9  0\r\n    Interest and wear and tear (say).              0  3\r\n                                                  -----\r\n         Total per day.                           10  6\r\n                                                  -----\r\n    For 80 tons per day, broken at the rate\r\n      of.                                          0  1½\r\n    Add for loss by dust and waste, 1 cwt.,\r\n      with price of coke at (say) 13s. 4d. per\r\n      ton.                                         0  8\r\n                                                  -----\r\n        Cost of breaking, per ton.                 0  9½\r\n\r\nAs coke, when broken, will usually fetch from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per ton\r\nmore than large, the result of using these machines is a net gain of\r\nfrom 1s. 3d. to 1s. 9d. per ton of coke. It is not so much the actual\r\ngain, however, that operates in favor of providing a supply of broken\r\ncoke, as the certainty that by so doing a market is obtained that would\r\nnot otherwise be available.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED COKE BREAKER.]\r\n\r\nIt will not be overstating the case to say that this coke breaker is by\r\nfar the simplest, strongest, and most economical appliance of its kind\r\nnow manufactured. That it does its work well is proved by experience;\r\nand the advantages of its construction are immediately apparent upon\r\ncomparison of its simple drum and single spindle with the flying hammers\r\nor rocking jaws, or double drums with toothed gearing which characterize\r\nsome other patterns of the same class of plant. It should be remarked,\r\nas already indicated, lest exception should be taken to the size of the\r\nmachine chosen here for illustration, that it can be made of any size\r\ndown to hand power. On the whole, however, as a few tons of broken coke\r\nmight be required at short notice even in a moderate sized works, it\r\nwould scarcely be advisable to depend upon too small a machine; since\r\nthe regular supply of the fuel thus improved may be trusted in a short\r\ntime to increase the demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED COKE BREAKER.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT IN PRINTING MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the design of Alfred Godfrey, of Clapton. According to this\r\nimprovement, as represented at Figs. 1 and 2, a rack, A, is employed\r\nvibrating on the pivot a, and a pinion, a1, so arranged that instead of\r\nthe pinion moving on a universal joint, or the rack moving in a parallel\r\nline from side to side of the pinion at the time the motion of the table\r\nis reversed, there is employed, for example, the radial arm, a2, mounted\r\non the shaft, a3, supporting the driving wheel, a4. The opposite or\r\nvibrating end of the radial arm, a2, supports in suitable bearings the\r\npinion, a1, and wheel, a5, driving the rack through the medium of the\r\ndriving wheel, a4, the effect of which is that through the mechanical\r\naction of the vibrating arm, a2, and pinion, a1 in conjunction with the\r\nvibrating movement of the rack, A, an easy, uniform, and silent motion\r\nis transmitted to the rack and table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVEMENTS IN PRINTING MACHINERY.

Within a month of the first strike of\r\nsilver ore the country was swarming with prospectors, and a thousand or\r\nmore prospects had been located.\r\n\r\nThe Perche district is on the eastern flanks of the Mimbres Mountains,\r\na range which is a part of the Rocky Mountain range, and runs north and\r\nsouth generally parallel with the Rio Grande, from which it lies about\r\nforty miles to the westward. The northern half of these mountains is\r\nknown as the Black Range, and was the center of considerable mining\r\nexcitement a year and a half ago. It is there that the Ivanhoe is\r\nlocated, of which Colonel Gillette was manager, and in which Robert\r\nIngersoll and Senator Plumb, of Kansas, were interested, much to the\r\ndisadvantage of the former. A new company has been organized, however,\r\nwith Colonel Ingersoll as president, and the reopening of work on the\r\nIvanhoe will probably prove a stimulus to the whole Black Range. From\r\nthis region the Perche district is from forty to sixty miles south. It\r\nis about twenty-five miles northwest of Lake Valley, and ten miles west\r\nof Hillsboro, a promising little mining town, with some mills and about\r\n300 people. The Perche River has three forks coming down from the\r\nmountains and uniting at Hillsboro, and it is in the region between\r\nthese forks that the recent strikes have been made.\r\n\r\nOn August 15 \"Jack\" Shedd, the original discoverer of the Robinson mine\r\nin Colorado, was prospecting on the south branch of the north fork of\r\nthe Perche River, when he made the first great strike in the district.\r\nOn the summit of a heavily timbered ridge he found some small pieces of\r\nnative silver, and then a lump of ore containing very pure silver in the\r\nform of sulphides, weighing 150 pounds, and afterward proved to be worth\r\non the average $11 a pound. All this was mere float, simply lying on the\r\nsurface of the ground. Afterward another block was found, weighing 87\r\npounds, of horn silver, with specimens nearly 75 per cent. silver. The\r\nstrike was kept a secret for a few days. Said a mining man: \"I went up\r\nto help bring the big lump down. We took it by a camp of prospectors who\r\nwere lying about entirely ignorant of any find. When they saw it they\r\ninstantly saddled their horses, galloped off, and I believe they\r\nprospected all night.\" A like excitement was created when the news of\r\nthis and one or two similar finds reached Lake Valley. Next morning\r\nevery waiter was gone from the little hotel, and a dozen men had left\r\nthe Sierra mines, to try their fortunes at prospecting.\r\n\r\nAs the news spread men poured into the Perche district from no one knows\r\nwhere, some armed with only a piece of salt pork, a little meal, and a\r\nprospecting pick; some mounted on mules, others on foot; old men and men\r\nhalf-crippled were among the number, but all bitten by the monomania\r\nwhich possesses every prospector. Now there are probably 2,000 men in\r\nthe Perche district, and the number of prospects located must far exceed\r\n1,000. Three miners from there with whom I was talking recently owned\r\nforty-seven mines among them, and while one acknowledged that hardly one\r\nprospect in a hundred turns out a prize, the other millionaire in embryo\r\nremarked that he wouldn't take $50,000 for one of his mines. So it goes,\r\nand the victims of the mining fever here seem as deaf to reason as the\r\nbuyers of mining stock in New York. Fuel was added to the flame by\r\nthe report that Shedd had sold his location, named the Solitaire, to\r\nex-Governor Tabor and Mr. Wurtzbach on August 25 for $100,000. This was\r\nnot true. I met Governor Tabor's representative, who came down recently\r\nto examine the properties, and learned that the Governor had not up to\r\nthat date bought the mine. He undoubtedly bonded it, however, and his\r\nrepresentative's opinion of the properties seemed highly favorable.\r\nThe Solitaire showed what appeared to be a contact vein, with walls of\r\nporphyry and limestone in a ledge thirty feet wide in places, containing\r\na high assay of horned silver. The vein was composed of quartz, bearing\r\nsulphides, with horn silver plainly visible, giving an average assay of\r\nfrom $350 to $500. This was free milling. These were the results shown\r\nsimply by surface explorations, which were certainly exceedingly\r\npromising. Recently it has been stated that a little development shows\r\nthe vein to be only a blind lead, but the statement lacks confirmation.\r\nIn any case the effect of so sensational a discovery is the same in\r\ncreating an intense excitement and attracting swarms of prospectors.\r\n\r\nBut the Perche district does not rest on the Solitaire, for there has\r\nbeen abundance of mineral wealth discovered throughout its extent. Four\r\nmiles south of this prospect, on the middle fork of the Perche, is an\r\nactual mine--the Bullion--which was purchased by four or five Western\r\nmining men for $10,000, and yielded $11,000 in twenty days. The ore\r\ncontains horn and native silver. On the same fork are the Iron King and\r\nAndy Johnson, both recently discovered and promising properties, and\r\nthere is a valuable mine now in litigation on the south fork of the\r\nPerche, with scores of prospects over the entire district. Now that one\r\nor two sensational strikes have attracted attention, and capital is\r\ndeveloping paying mines, the future of the Perche District seems\r\nassured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOY BEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _British Medical Journal_ says that Prof. E.

It is largely used as\r\nan article of food in China and Japan. Efforts have been made to\r\nacclimatize it in various parts of the continent of Europe, and fair\r\nsuccess has been achieved in Italy and France; many foods are made from\r\nit and its straw is a useful fodder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON A NEW ARC ELECTRIC LAMP.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Paper read at the British Association, Southampton. Revised\r\nby the Author.--_Nature_.]\r\n\r\nBy W.H. PREECE.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectric lamps on the arc principle are almost as numerous as the trees\r\nin the forest, and it is somewhat fresh to come upon something that is\r\nnovel. In these lamps the carbons are consumed as the current flows, and\r\nit is the variation in their consumption which occasions the flickering\r\nand irregularity of the light that is so irritating to the eyes. Special\r\nmechanical contrivances or regulators have to be used to compensate for\r\nthis destruction of the carbons, as in the Siemens and Brush type, or\r\nelse refractory materials have to be combined with the carbons, as in\r\nthe Jablochkoff candle and in the lamp Soleil. The steadiness of the\r\nlight depends upon the regularity with which the carbons are moved\r\ntoward each other as they are consumed, so as to maintain the electric\r\nresistance between them a constant quantity. Each lamp must have a\r\ncertain elasticity of regulation of its own, to prevent irregularities\r\nfrom the variable material of carbon used, and from variations in the\r\ncurrent itself and in the machinery.\r\n\r\nIn all electric lamps, except the Brockie, the regulator is in the lamp\r\nitself. In the Brockie system the regulation is automatic, and is made\r\nat certain rapid intervals by the motor engine. This causes a periodic\r\nblinking that is detrimental to this lamp for internal illumination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nM. Abdank, the inventor of the system which I have the pleasure of\r\nbringing before the Section, separates his regulator from his lamp.\r\nThe regulator may be fixed anywhere, within easy inspection and\r\nmanipulation, and away from any disturbing influence in the lamp. The\r\nlamp can be fixed in any inaccessible place.\r\n\r\n_The Lamp_ (Figs. 1, 2, and 3.)--The bottom or negative carbon is fixed,\r\nbut the top or positive carbon is movable, in a vertical line. It is\r\nscrewed at the point, C, to a brass rod, T (Fig. 2), which moves freely\r\ninside the tubular iron core of an electromagnet, K. This rod is\r\nclutched and lifted by the soft iron armature, A B, when a current\r\npasses through the coil, M M. The mass of the iron in the armature is\r\ndistributed so that the greater portion is at one end, B, much nearer\r\nthe pole than the other end. Hence this portion is attracted first, the\r\narmature assumes an inclined position, maintained by a brass button, t,\r\nwhich prevents any adhesion between the armature and the core of the\r\nelectromagnet. The electric connection between the carbon and the coil\r\nof the electromagnet is maintained by the flexible wire, S.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe electromagnet, A (Fig. 1), is fixed to a long and heavy rack, C,\r\nwhich falls by its own weight and by the weight of the electromagnet and\r\nthe carbon fixed to it. The length of the rack is equal to the length of\r\nthe two carbons. The fall of the rack is controlled by a friction break,\r\nB (Fig. 3), which acts upon the last of a train of three wheels put\r\nin motion by the above weight. The break, B, is fixed at one end of\r\na lever, B A, the other end carrying a soft iron armature, F,\r\neasily adjusted by three screws. This armature is attracted by the\r\nelectromagnet, E E (whose resistance is 1,200 ohms), whenever a current\r\ncirculates through it. The length of the play is regulated by the screw,\r\nV. The spring, L, applies tension to the break.\r\n\r\n_The Regulator_.--This consists of a balance and a cut-off.\r\n\r\n_The Balance_ (Figs. 4 and 5) is made with two solenoids. S and S',\r\nwhose relative resistances is adjustable. S conveys the main current,\r\nand is wound with thick wire having practically no resistance, and S'\r\nis traversed by a shunt current, and is wound with fine wire having a\r\nresistance of 600 ohms. In the axes of these two coils a small and light\r\niron tube (2 mm. diameter and 60 mm. length) freely moves in a vertical\r\nline between two guides. When magnetized it has one pole in the middle\r\nand the other at each end. The upward motion is controlled by the\r\nspring, N T. The spring rests upon the screw, H, with which it makes\r\ncontact by platinum electrodes. This contact is broken whenever the\r\nlittle iron rod strikes the spring, N T.\r\n\r\nThe positive lead from the dynamo is attached to the terminal, B, then\r\npasses through the coil, S, to the terminal, B', whence it proceeds to\r\nthe lamp. The negative lead is attached to terminal, A, passing directly\r\nto the other terminal, A', and thence to the lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4]\r\n\r\nThe shunt which passes through the fine coil, S', commences at the\r\npoint, P. The other end is fixed to the screw, H, whence it has two\r\npaths, the one offering no resistance through the spring, T N, to the\r\nupper negative terminal, A'; the other through the terminal, J, to the\r\nelectromagnet of the break, M, and thence to the negative terminal of\r\nthe lamp, L'.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n_The Cut-off_.--The last part of the apparatus (Fig. 4) to be described\r\nis the cut-off, which is used when there are several lamps in series. It\r\nis brought into play by the switch, C D, which can be placed at E or D.\r\nWhen it is at E, the negative terminal, A, is in communication with\r\nthe positive terminal, B, through the resistance, R, which equals the\r\nresistance of the lamp, which is, therefore, out of circuit. When it is\r\nat D the cut-off acts automatically to do the same thing when required.\r\nThis is done by a solenoid, V, which has two coils, the one of thick\r\nwire offering no resistance, and the other of 2,000 ohms resistance. The\r\nfine wire connects the terminals, A' and B. The solenoid has a movable\r\nsoft iron core suspended by the spring, U. It has a cross-piece of iron\r\nwhich can dip into two mercury cups, G and K, when the core is sucked\r\ninto the solenoid. When this is the case, which happens when any\r\naccident occurs to the lamp, the terminal, A, is placed in connection\r\nwith the terminal, B, through the thick wire of V and the resistance, R,\r\nin the same way as it was done by the switch, C D.\r\n\r\n_Electrical Arrangement_.--The mode in which several lamps are connected\r\nup in series is shown by Fig. 6. M is the dynamo machine. The + lead is\r\nconnected to B1 of the balance it then passes to the lamp, L, returning\r\nto the balance, and then proceeds to each other lamp, returning finally\r\nto the negative pole of the machine. When the current enters the balance\r\nit passes through the coil, S, magnetizing the iron core and drawing\r\nit downward (Fig. 4). It then passes to the lamp, L L', through the\r\ncarbons, then returns to the balance, and proceeds back to the negative\r\nterminal of the machine. A small portion of the current is shunted off\r\nat the point, P, passing through the coil, S', through the contact\r\nspring, T N, to the terminal, A', and drawing the iron core in\r\nopposition to S. The carbons are in contact, but in passing through\r\nthe lamp the current magnetizes the electromagnet, M (Fig. 2), which\r\nattracts the armature, A B, that bites and lifts up the rod, T, with the\r\nupper carbon, a definite and fixed distance that is easily regulated\r\nby the screws, Y Y. The arc then is formed, and will continue to burn\r\nsteadily as long as the current remains constant. But the moment the\r\ncurrent falls, due to the increased resistance of the arc, a greater\r\nproportion passes through the shunt, S' (Fig. 4), increasing its\r\nmagnetic moment on the iron core, while that of S is diminishing. The\r\nresult is that a moment arrives when equilibrium is destroyed, the iron\r\nrod strikes smartly and sharply upon the spring, N T. Contact between T\r\nand H is broken, and the current passes through the electromagnet of the\r\nbreak in the lamp. The break is released for an instant, the carbons\r\napproach each other. But the same rupture of contact introduces in the\r\nshunt a new resistance of considerable magnitude (viz., 1,200 ohms),\r\nthat of the electromagnets of the break. Then the strength of the shunt\r\ncurrent diminishes considerably, and the solenoid, S, recovers briskly\r\nits drawing power upon the rod, and contact is restored. The carbons\r\napproach during these periods only about 0.01 to 0.02 millimeter.\r\nIf this is not sufficient to restore equilibrium it is repeated\r\ncontinually, until equilibrium is obtained. The result is that the\r\ncarbon is continually falling by a motion invisible to the eye, but\r\nsufficient to provide for the consumption of the carbons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6]\r\n\r\nThe contact between N T and H is never completely broken, the sparks are\r\nvery feeble, and the contacts do not oxidize. The resistances inserted\r\nare so considerable that heating cannot occur, while the portion of the\r\ncurrent abstracted for the control is so small that it may be neglected.\r\n\r\nThe balance acts precisely like the key of a Morse machine, and the\r\nbreak precisely like the sounder-receiver so well known in telegraphy.\r\nIt emits the same kind of sounds, and acts automatically like a skilled\r\nand faithful telegraphist.\r\n\r\nThis regulation, by very small and short successive steps, offers\r\nseveral advantages: (1) it is imperceptible to the eye; (2) it does not\r\naffect the main current; (3) any sudden instantaneous variation of the\r\nmain current does not allow a too near approach of the carbon points.\r\nLet, now, an accident occur; for instance, a carbon is broken. At once\r\nthe automatic cut-off acts, the current passes through the resistance,\r\nR, instead of passing through the lamp. The current through the fine\r\ncoil is suddenly increased, the rod is drawn in, contact is made at G\r\nand K, and the current is sent through the coil, R. As soon as contact\r\nis again made by the carbons, the current in the coil, S, is increased,\r\nthat of the thick wire in V diminished, and the antagonistic spring,\r\nU, breaks the contact at G and K. The rupture of the light is almost\r\ninvisible, because the relighting is so brisk and sharp.\r\n\r\nI have seen this lamp in action, and its constant steadiness leaves\r\nnothing to be desired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR OBTAINING PURE WATER FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC USE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur readers are well aware that water as found naturally is never\r\nabsolutely free from dissolved impurities; and in ordinary cases it\r\ncontains solid impurities derived both from the inorganic and organic\r\nkingdoms, together with gaseous substances; these latter being generally\r\nderived from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBy far the purest water which occurs in nature is rain-water, and if\r\nthis be collected in a secluded district, and after the air has been\r\nwell washed by previous rain, its purity is remarkable; the extraneous\r\nmatter consisting of little else than a trace of carbonic acid and other\r\ngases dissolved from the air. In fact, such water is far purer than any\r\ndistilled water to be obtained in commerce. The case is very different\r\nwhen the rain-water is collected in a town or densely populated\r\ndistrict, more especially if the water has been allowed to flow over\r\ndirty roofs. The black and foully-smelling liquid popularly known as\r\nsoft water is so rich in carbonaceous and organic constituents as to be\r\nof very limited use to the photographer; but by taking the precaution of\r\nfitting up a simple automatic shunt for diverting the stream until the\r\nroofs have been thoroughly washed, it becomes possible to insure a good\r\nsupply of clean and serviceable soft water, even in London. Several\r\nforms of shunt have been devised, some of these being so complex as\r\nto offer every prospect of speedy disorganization; but a simple and\r\nefficient apparatus is figured in _Engineering_ by a correspondent who\r\nsigns himself \"Millwright,\" and as we have thoroughly proved the value\r\nof an apparatus which is practically identical, we reproduce the\r\nsubstance of his communication.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of Newcastle, a retired banker, having tried various filters\r\nto purify the rain-water collected on the roof of his house, at length\r\nhad the idea to allow no water to run into the cistern until the roof\r\nhad been well washed. After first putting up a hard-worked valve, the\r\narrangement as sketched below has been hit upon. Now Newcastle is a very\r\nsmoky place, and yet my friend gets water as pure as gin, and almost\r\nabsolutely free from any smack of soot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe sketch explains itself. The weight, W, and the angle of the lever,\r\nL, are such, that when the valve, V, is once opened it goes full open. A\r\nsmall hole in the can C, acts like a cataract, and brings matters to a\r\nnormal state very soon after the rain ceases.\r\n\r\nThe proper action of the apparatus can only be insured by a careful\r\nadjustment of the weight, W, the angle through which the valve opens,\r\nand the magnitude of the vessel, C. It is an advantage to make\r\nthe vessel, C, somewhat broader in proportion to its height than\r\nrepresented, and to provide it with a movable strainer placed about half\r\nway down. This tends to protect the cataract hole, and any accumulation\r\nof leaves and dirt can be removed once in six months or so. Clean soft\r\nwater is valuable to the photographer in very many cases. Iron developer\r\n(wet plate) free from chlorides will ordinarily remain effective on the\r\nplate much longer than when chlorides are present, and the pyrogallic\r\nsolution for dry-plate work will keep good for along time if made with\r\nsoft water, while the lime which is present in hard water causes the\r\npyrogallic acid to oxidize with considerable rapidity. Negatives that\r\nhave been developed with oxalate developer often become covered with a\r\nvery unsightly veil of calcium oxalate when rinsed with hard water, and\r\nsomething of a similar character occasionally occurs in the case of\r\nsilver prints which are transferred directly from the exposure frame to\r\nimpure water.\r\n\r\nTo the carbon printer clean rain-water is of considerable value, as he\r\ncan develop much more rapidly with soft water than with hard water;\r\nor, what comes to the same thing, he can dissolve away his superfluous\r\ngelatine at a lower temperature than would otherwise be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe cleanest rain-water which can ordinarily be collected in a town is\r\nnot sufficiently pure to be used with advantage in the preparation of\r\nthe nitrate bath, it being advisable to use the purest distilled water\r\nfor this purpose; and in many cases it is well to carefully distill\r\nwater for the bath in a glass apparatus of the kind figured below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA, thin glass flask serving as a retort. The tube, T, is fitted\r\nair-tight to the flask by a cork, C.\r\n\r\nB, receiver into which the tube, T, fits quite loosely.\r\n\r\nD, water vessel intended to keep the spiral of lamp wick, which is shown\r\nas surrounding T, in a moist condition. This wick acts as a siphon, and\r\nwater is gradually drawn over into the lower receptacle, E.\r\n\r\nL, spirit lamp, which may, in many cases, be advantageously replaced by\r\na Bunsen burner.\r\n\r\nA small metal still, provided with a tin condensing worm, is, however, a\r\nmore generally serviceable arrangement, and if ordinary precautions are\r\ntaken to make sure that the worm tube is clean, the resulting distilled\r\nwater will be nearly as pure as that distilled in glass vessels.\r\n\r\nSuch a still as that figured below can be heated conveniently over an\r\nordinary kitchen fire, and should find a place among the appliances\r\nof every photographer. Distilled water should always be used in the\r\npreparation of emulsion, as the impurities of ordinary water may often\r\nintroduce disturbing conditions.--_Photographic News_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK PHOSPHORUS.\r\n\r\nBy P.

The object of revivification is to render\r\nthe black fit to be used again after it has lost its decolorizing\r\nproperties through service--that is to say, to free its pores from the\r\nabsorbed salts and insoluble compounds that have formed therein\r\nduring the operation of sugar refining. There are two methods\r\nemployed--fermentation and washing. At present the tendency is to\r\nabandon the former in order to proceed with as small a stock of black as\r\npossible, and to adopt the method of washing with water and acid in a\r\nrotary washer.\r\n\r\nFigs. 1 and 2 represent a plan and elevation of a bone-black room,\r\ncontaining light filters, A, arranged in a circle around wells, B. These\r\nlatter have the form of a prism with trapezoidal base, whose small sides\r\nend at the same point, d, and the large ones at the filter. The funnel,\r\nE, of the washer, F, is placed in the space left by the small ends of\r\nthe wells, so that the black may be taken from these latter and thrown\r\ndirectly into the washer. The washer is arranged so that the black may\r\nflow out near the steam fitter, G, beneath the floor. The discharge of\r\nthis filter is toward the side of the elevator, H, which takes in the\r\nwet black below, and carries it up and pours it into the drier situated\r\nat the upper part of the furnace. This elevator, Figs. 3 and 4, is\r\nformed of two vertical wooden uprights, A, ten centimeters in thickness,\r\nto which are fixed two round-iron bars the same as guides. The lift,\r\nproperly so-called, consists of an iron frame, C, provided at the four\r\nangles with rollers, D, and supporting a swinging bucket, E, which, on\r\nits arrival at the upper part of the furnace, allows the black to fall\r\nto an inclined plane that leads it to the upper part of the drier. The\r\nleft is raised and lowered by means of a pitch-chain, F, fixed to the\r\nmiddle of the frame, C, and passing over two pulleys, G, at the upper\r\npart of the frame and descending to the mechanism that actuates it.\r\nThis latter comprises a nut, I, acting directly on the chain; a toothed\r\nwheel, K, and a pinion, J, gearing with the latter and keyed upon the\r\nshaft of the pulleys, L and M. The diameter of the toothed wheel, K, is\r\n0.295 of a meter, and it makes 53.4 revolutions per minute. The diameter\r\nof the pinion is 0.197 of a meter, and it makes 80 revolutions per\r\nminute. The pulleys, M and L, are 0.31 of a meter in diameter, and\r\nmake 80 revolutions per minute. Motion is transmitted to them by other\r\npulleys, N, keyed upon a shaft placed at the lower part, which receives\r\nits motion from the engine of the establishment through the intermedium\r\nof the pulley, O. The diameter of the latter is 0.385 of a meter, and\r\nthat of N is 0.58. They each make 43 revolutions per minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--ELEVATION OF BONE-BLACK REVIVIFYING PLANT\r\n(SCHREIBER'S SYSTEM.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 2.--PLAN VIEW.\r\n\r\nFIG. 3.--LATERAL VIEW OF ELEVATOR.\r\n\r\nFIG. 4.--FRONT VIEW OF ELEVATOR.\r\n\r\nFIG. 5.--CONTINUOUS FURNACE FOR REVIVIFYING BONE-BLACK.]\r\n\r\nThe elevator is set in motion by the simple maneuver of the gearing\r\nlever, P, and when this has been done all the other motions are effected\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\n_The Animal Black Furnace_.--This consists of a masonry casing of\r\nrectangular form, in which are arranged on each side of the same\r\nfire-place two rows of cast-iron retorts, D, of undulating form, each\r\ncomposed of three parts, set one within the other. These retorts, which\r\nserve for the revivification of the black, are incased in superposed\r\nblocks of refractory clay, P, Q, S, designed to regularize the\r\ntransmission of heat and to prevent burning. These pieces are kept in\r\ntheir respective places by crosspieces, R. The space between the retorts\r\noccupied by the fire-place, Y, is covered with a cylindrical dome, O, of\r\nrefractory tiles, forming a fire-chamber with the inner surface of the\r\nblocks, P, Q, and S. The front of the surface consists of a cast-iron\r\nplate, containing the doors to the fire-place and ash pan, and a larger\r\none to allow of entrance to the interior to make repairs.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal disadvantages of furnaces for revivifying animal\r\ncharcoal has been that they possessed no automatic drier for drying the\r\nblack on its exit from the washer. It was for the purpose of remedying\r\nthis that Mr. Schreiber was led to invent the automatic system of drying\r\nshown at the upper part of the furnace, and which is formed of two\r\npipes, B, of undulating form, like the retorts, with openings throughout\r\ntheir length for the escape of steam. Between these pipes there is a\r\nclosed space into which enters the waste heat and products of combustion\r\nfrom the furnace. These latter afterward escape through the chimney at\r\nthe upper part.\r\n\r\nIn order that the black may be put in bags on issuing from the furnace,\r\nit must be cooled as much as possible. For this purpose there are\r\narranged on each side of the furnace two pieces of cast iron tubes, F,\r\nof rectangular section, forming a prolongation of the retorts and making\r\nwith them an angle of about 45 degrees. The extremities of these tubes\r\nterminate in hollow rotary cylinders, G, which permit of regulating the\r\nflow of the black into a car, J (Fig. 1), running on rails.\r\n\r\nFrom what precedes, it will be readily understood how a furnace is run\r\non this plan.\r\n\r\nThe bone-black in the hopper, A, descends into the drier, B, enters the\r\nretorts, D, and, after revivification, passes into the cooling pipes, F,\r\nfrom whence it issues cold and ready to be bagged. A coke fire having\r\nbeen built in the fire-place, Y, the flames spread throughout the fire\r\nchamber, direct themselves toward the bottom, divide into two parts to\r\nthe right and left, and heat the back of the retorts in passing. Then\r\nthe two currents mount through the lateral flues, V, and unite so as to\r\nform but one in the drier. Within the latter there are arranged plates\r\ndesigned to break the current from the flames, and allow it to heat all\r\nthe inner parts of the pipes, while the apertures in the drier allow of\r\nthe escape of the steam.\r\n\r\nBy turning one of the cylinders, G, so as to present its aperture\r\nopposite that of the cooler, it instantly fills up with black. At this\r\nmoment the whole column, from top to bottom, is set in motion. The\r\nbone-black, in passing through the undulations, is thrown alternately to\r\nthe right and left until it finally reaches the coolers. This operation\r\nis repeated as many times as the cylinder is filled during the descent\r\nof one whole column, that is to say, about forty times.\r\n\r\nWith an apparatus of the dimensions here described, 120 hectoliters\r\nof bone-black may be revivified in twenty four hours, with 360 to 400\r\nkilogrammes of coke.--_Annales Industrielles_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 330, page 5264.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAP AND ITS MANUFACTURE, FROM A CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our last article, under the above heading, the advantages to be\r\ngained by the use of potash soap as compared with soda soap were pointed\r\nout, and the reasons of this superiority, especially in the case of\r\nwashing wool or woolen fabrics, were pretty fully gone into. It was also\r\nfurther explained why the potash soaps generally sold to the public were\r\nunfit for general use, owing to their not being neutral--that is to say,\r\ncontaining a considerable excess of free or unsaponified alkali, which\r\nacts injuriously on the fiber of any textile material, and causes sore\r\nhands if used for household or laundry purposes. It was shown that the\r\ncause of this defect was owing to the old-fashioned method of making\r\npotash or soft soap, by boiling with wood ashes or other impure form of\r\npotash; but that a perfectly pure and neutral potash soap could readily\r\nbe made with pure caustic potash, which within the last few years has\r\nbecome a commercial article, manufactured on a large scale; just in\r\nthe same manner as the powdered 98 per cent. caustic soda, which was\r\nrecommended in our previous articles on making hard soap without\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\nThe process of making pure neutral potash soap is very simple, and\r\nalmost identical with that for making hard soap with pure powdered\r\ncaustic soda. The following directions, if carefully and exactly\r\nfollowed, will produce a first-class potash soap, suitable either for\r\nthe woolen manufacturer for washing his wool, and the cloth afterward\r\nmade from it, or for household and laundry purposes, for which uses it\r\nwill be found far superior to any soda soap, no matter how pure or well\r\nmade it may be.\r\n\r\nDissolve twenty pounds of pure caustic potash in two gallons of water.\r\nPure caustic potash is very soluble, and dissolves almost immediately,\r\nheating the water. Let the lye thus made cool until warm to the\r\nhand--say about 90 F. Melt eighty pounds of tallow or grease, which must\r\nbe free from salt, and let it cool until fairly hot to the hand--say\r\n130 F.; or eighty pounds of any vegetable or animal oil may be taken\r\ninstead. Now pour the caustic potash lye into the melted tallow or oil,\r\nstirring with a flat wooden stirrer about three inches broad, until both\r\nare thoroughly mixed and smooth in appearance. This mixing may be done\r\nin the boiler used to melt the tallow, or in a tub, or half an oil\r\nbarrel makes a good mixing vessel. Wrap the tub or barrel well up in\r\nblankets or sheepskins, and put away for a week in some warm dry place,\r\nduring which the mixture slowly turns into soap, giving a produce of\r\nabout 120 pounds of excellent potash soap. If this soap is made with\r\ntallow or grease it will be nearly as hard as soda soap. When made by\r\nfarmers or householders tallow or grease will generally be taken, as it\r\nis the cheapest, and ready to hand on the spot. For manufacturers, or\r\nfor making laundry soap, nothing could be better than cotton seed oil. A\r\nmagnificent soap can be made with this article, lathering very freely.\r\nWhen made with oil it is better to remelt in a kettle the potash soap,\r\nmade according to the above directions, with half its weight of water,\r\nusing very little heat, stirring constantly, and removing the fire as\r\nsoon as the water is mixed with and taken up by the soap. A beautifully\r\nbright soap is obtained in this way, and curiously the soap is actually\r\nmade much harder and stiffer by this addition of water than when it is\r\nin a more concentrated state previously to the water being added.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the caustic potash for making the soap, it can be\r\nobtained in all sizes of drums, but small packages just sufficient for\r\na batch of soap are generally more economical than larger packages, as\r\npure caustic potash melts and deteriorates very quickly when exposed\r\nto the air. The Greenbank Alkali Co., of St. Helens, seems to have\r\nappreciated this, and put upon the market pure caustic potash in twenty\r\npound canisters, which are very convenient for potash soft soap making\r\nby consumers for their own use.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject of caustic potash, it cannot be too often repeated\r\nthat _caustic potash_ is a totally different article to _caustic soda_,\r\nthough just like it in appearance, and therefore often sold as such.\r\nOne of the most barefaced instances of this is the so-called \"crystal\r\npotash,\" \"ball potash,\" or \"rock potash,\" of the lye packers, sold in\r\none pound packages, which absolutely, without exception, do not contain\r\na single grain of potash, but simply consist of caustic soda more or\r\nless adulterated--as a rule very much \"more\" than \"less!\" It is much\r\nto be regretted that this fraud on the public has been so extensively\r\npracticed, as potash has been greatly discredited by this procedure.\r\n\r\nThe subject of fleece scouring or washing the wool while growing on\r\nthe sheep, with a potash soap made on the spot with the waste tallow\r\ngenerally to be had on every sheep farm, seems recently to have been\r\nattracting attention in some quarters, and certainly would be a source\r\nof profit to sheep owners by putting their wool on the market in the\r\nbest condition, and at the same time cleaning the skin of the sheep. It\r\ntherefore appears to be a move in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this series of articles on practical soap making from a\r\nconsumer's point of view, the writer hopes that, although the subject\r\nhas been somewhat imperfectly handled, owing to necessarily limited\r\nspace and with many unavoidable interruptions, yet that they may have\r\nbeen found of some interest and assistance to consumers of soap who\r\ndesire easily and readily to make a pure and unadulterated article for\r\ntheir own use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTON SEED OIL.\r\n\r\nBy S.S. BRADFORD, Ph.G.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving had occasion during the last six years to manufacture lead\r\nplaster in considerable quantities, it occurred to me that cotton seed\r\noil might be used instead of olive oil, at less expense, and with as\r\ngood results. The making of this plaster with cotton seed oil has been\r\nquestioned, as, according to some authorities, the product is not of\r\ngood consistence, and is apt to be soft, sticky, and dark colored;\r\nbut in my experience such is not the case. If the U. S. P. process is\r\nfollowed in making this plaster, substituting for the olive oil cotton\r\nseed oil, and instead of one half-pint of boiling water one and one-half\r\npint are added, the product obtained will be equally as good as that\r\nfrom olive oil. My results with this oil in making lead plaster led me\r\nto try it in making the different liniments of the Pharmacopoeia, with\r\nthe following results:\r\n\r\n_Linimentum Ammoniæ_.--This liniment, made with cotton seed oil, is of\r\nmuch better consistency than when made with olive oil. It is not so\r\nthick, will pour easily out of the bottle, and if the ammonia used is of\r\nproper strength, will make a perfect liniment.\r\n\r\n_Linimentum Calcis_.--Cotton seed oil is not at all adapted to making\r\nthis liniment. It does not readily saponify, separates quickly, and it\r\nis almost impossible to unite when separated.\r\n\r\n_Linimentum Camphoræ_.--Cotton seed oil is far superior to olive oil in\r\nmaking this liniment, it being a much better solvent of camphor. It has\r\nnot that disagreeable odor so commonly found in the liniment.\r\n\r\n_Linimentum Chloroformi_.--Cotton seed oil being very soluble in\r\nchloroform, the liniment made with it leaves nothing to be desired.\r\n\r\n_Linimentum Plumbi Subacetatis_.--When liq. plumbi subacet. is mixed\r\nwith cotton seed oil and allowed to stand for some time the oil assumes\r\na reddish color similar to that of freshly made tincture of myrrh. When\r\nthe liquor is mixed with olive oil, if the oil be pure, no such change\r\ntakes place. Noticing this change, it occurred to me that this would be\r\na simple and easy way to detect cotton seed oil when mixed with olive\r\noil. This change usually takes place after standing from twelve to\r\ntwenty-four hours. It is easily detected in mixtures containing five\r\nper cent., or even less, of the oils, and I am convinced, after making\r\nnumerous experiments with different oils, that it is peculiar to cotton\r\nseed oil.--_American Journal of Pharmacy_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOOD AND ENERGY OF MAN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a lecture delivered at the Sanitary Congress, at\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, September 28, 1882.]\r\n\r\nBy PROF. DE CHAUMONT, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough eating cannot be said to be in any way a new fashion, it has\r\nnevertheless been reserved for modern times, and indeed we may say the\r\npresent generation, to get a fairly clear idea of the way in which\r\nfood is really utilized for the work of our bodily frame. We must not,\r\nhowever, plume ourselves too much upon our superior knowledge, for\r\ninklings of the truth, more or less dim, have been had through all ages,\r\nand we are now stepping into the inheritance of times gone by, using the\r\nlong and painful experience of our predecessors as the stepping-stone\r\nto our more accurate knowledge of the present time. In this, as in many\r\nother things, we are to some extent in the position of a dwarf on the\r\nshoulders of a giant; the dwarf may, indeed, see further than the giant;\r\nbut he remains a dwarf, and the giant a giant.\r\n\r\nThe question has been much discussed as to what the original food of man\r\nwas, and some people have made it a subject of excited contention. The\r\nmost reasonable conclusion is that man is naturally a frugivorous or\r\nfruit-eating animal, like his cousins the monkeys, whom he still so\r\nmuch resembles. This forms a further argument in favor of his being\r\noriginated in warm regions, where fruits of all kinds were plentiful. It\r\nis pretty clear that the resort to animal food, whether the result of\r\nthe pressure of want from failure of vegetable products, or a mere taste\r\nand a desire for change and more appetizing food, is one that took place\r\nmany ages ago, probably in the earliest anthropoid, if not in the latest\r\npithecoid stage. No doubt some advantage was recognized in the more\r\nrapid digestion and the comparative ease with which the hunter or fisher\r\ncould obtain food, instead of waiting for the ripening of fruits in\r\ncountries which had more or less prolonged periods of cold and inclement\r\nweather. Some anatomical changes have doubtless resulted from the\r\npractice, but they are not of sufficiently marked character to found\r\nmuch argument upon; all that we can say being that the digestive\r\napparatus in man seems well adapted for digesting any food that is\r\ncapable of yielding nutriment, and that even when an entire change is\r\nmade in the mode of feeding, the adaptability of the human system\r\nshows itself in a more or less rapid accommodation to the altered\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nFood, then, is any substance which can be taken into the body and\r\napplied to use, either in building up or repairing the tissues and\r\nframework of the body itself, or in providing energy and producing\r\nanimal heat, or any substance which, without performing those functions\r\ndirectly, controls, directs, or assists their performance. With this\r\nwide definition it is evident that we include all the ordinary articles\r\nrecognized commonly as food, and that we reject all substances\r\nrecognized commonly as poisons. But it will also include such substances\r\nas water and air, both of which are essential for nutrition, but are not\r\nusually recognized as belonging to the list of food substances in the\r\nordinary sense. When we carry our investigation further, we find that\r\nthe organic substances may be again divided into two distinct classes,\r\nnamely, that which contains nitrogen (the casein), and those that do not\r\n(the butter and sugar).\r\n\r\nOn ascertaining this, we are immediately struck with the remarkable fact\r\nthat all the tissues and fluids of the body, muscles (or flesh),\r\nbone, blood--all, in short, except the fat--contain nitrogen, and,\r\nconsequently, for their building up in the young, and for their repair\r\nand renewal in the adult, nitrogen is absolutely required. We therefore\r\nreasonably infer that the nitrogenous substance is necessary for this\r\npurpose. Experiment has borne this out, for men who have been compelled\r\nto live without nitrogenous food by dire necessity, and criminals on\r\nwhom the experiment has been tried, have all perished sooner or later in\r\nconsequence. When nitrogenous substances are used in the body, they\r\nare, of course, broken up and oxidized, or perhaps we ought to say more\r\naccurately, they take the place of the tissues of the body which wear\r\naway and are carried off by oxidation and other chemical changes.\r\n\r\nNow, modern science tell us that such changes are accompanied with\r\nmanifestations of energy in some form or other, most frequently in\r\nthat of heat, and we must look, therefore, upon nitrogenous food\r\nas contributing to the energy of the body in addition to its other\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nWhat are the substances which we may class as nitrogenous. In the first\r\nplace, we have the typical example of the purest form in _albumin_,\r\nor white of egg; and from this the name is now given to the class of\r\n_albuminates_. The animal albuminates are: Albumin from eggs, fibrin\r\nfrom muscles, or flesh, myosin, or synronin, also from animals, casein\r\n(or cheesy matter) from milk, and the nitrogenous substances from blood.\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom, we have glutin, or vegetable fibrin, which is\r\nthe nourishing constituent of wheat, barley, oats, etc.; and legumin,\r\nor vegetable casein, which is the peculiar substance found in peas and\r\nbeans. The other organic constituents--viz., the fats and the starches\r\nand sugars--contain no nitrogen, and were at one time thought to be\r\nconcerned in producing animal heat.\r\n\r\nWe now know--thanks to the labors of Joule, Lyon Playfair, Clausius,\r\nTyndall, Helmholtz, etc.--that heat itself is a mode of motion, a form\r\nof convertible energy, which can be made to do useful or productive\r\nwork, and be expressed in terms of actual work done. Modern experiment\r\nshows that all our energy is derived from that of food, and, in\r\nparticular from the non-nitrogenous part of it, that is, the fat,\r\nstarch, and sugar. The nutrition of man is best maintained when he is\r\nprovided with a due admixture of all the four classes of aliment which\r\nwe have mentioned, and not only that, but he is also better off if he\r\nhas a variety of each class. Thus he may and ought to have albumen,\r\nfibrine, gluten, and casein among the albuminates, or at least two of\r\nthem; butter and lard, or suet, or oil among the fats; starch of wheat,\r\npotato, rice, peas, etc., and cane-sugar, and milk-sugar among the\r\ncarbo-hydrates. The salts cannot be replaced, so far as we know. Life\r\nmay be maintained in fair vigor for some time on albuminates only, but\r\nthis is done at the expense of the tissues, especially the fat of the\r\nbody, and the end must soon come; with fat and carbo hydrates alone\r\nvigor may also be maintained for some time, at the expense of the\r\ntissues also, but the limit is a near one, In either of these cases we\r\nsuppose sufficient water and salts to be provided.\r\n\r\nWe must now inquire into the quantities of food necessary; and this\r\nnecessitates a little consideration of the way in which the work of\r\nthe body is carried on. We must look upon the human body exactly as a\r\nmachine; like an engine with which we are all so familiar. A certain\r\namount of work requires to be done, say, a certain number of miles of\r\ndistance to be traversed; we know that to do this a certain number of\r\npounds, or hundredweights, or tons of coal must be put into the fire of\r\nthe boiler in order to furnish the requisite amount of energy through\r\nthe medium of steam. This amount of fuel must bear a certain proportion\r\nto the work, and also to the velocity with which it is done, so both\r\nquantity and time have to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nNo lecture on diet would be complete without a reference to the vexed\r\nquestion of alcohol. I am no teetotal advocate, and I repudiate the\r\nrubbish too often spouted from teetotal platforms, talk that is,\r\nperhaps, inseparable from the advocacy of a cause that imports a good\r\ndeal of enthusiasm. I am at one, however, in recognizing the evils of\r\nexcess, and would gladly hail their diminution. But I believe that\r\nalcohol properly used may be a comfort and a blessing, just as I know\r\nthat improperly used it becomes a bane and a curse. But we are now\r\nconcerned with it as an article of diet in relation to useful work, and\r\nit may be well to call attention markedly to the fact that its use in\r\nthis way is very limited. The experiments of the late Dr. Parkes, made\r\nin our laboratory, at Netley, were conclusive on the point, that beyond\r\nan amount that would be represented by about one and a half to two pints\r\nof beer, alcohol no longer provided any convertible energy, and that,\r\ntherefore, to take it in the belief that it did do so is an error.\r\nIt may give a momentary stimulus in considerable doses, but this is\r\ninvariably followed by a corresponding depression, and it is a maxim now\r\ngenerally followed, especially on service, never to give it before or\r\nduring work. There are, of course, some persons who are better without\r\nit altogether, and so all moderation ought to be commended, if not\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nThere are other beverages which are more useful than the alcoholic,\r\nas restoratives, and for support in fatigue. Tea and coffee are\r\nparticularly good. Another excellent restorative is a weak solution\r\nof Liebig's extract of meat, which has a remarkable power of removing\r\nfatigue. Perhaps one of the most useful and most easily obtainable is\r\nweak oatmeal gruel, either hot or cold. With regard to tobacco, it also\r\nhas some value in lessening fatigue in those who are able to take it,\r\nbut it may easily be carried to excess. Of it we may say, as of alcohol,\r\nthat in moderation it seems harmless, and even useful to some extent,\r\nbut, in excess, it is rank poison.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point which I must refer to, and which is especially\r\ninteresting to a great seaport like this. This is the question of\r\nscurvy--a question of vital importance to a maritime nation. A paper\r\nlately issued by Mr. Thomas Gray, of the Board of Trade, discloses the\r\nregrettable fact that since 1873 there has been a serious falling off,\r\nthe outbreaks of scurvy having again increased until they reached\r\nninety-nine in 1881. This, Mr. Gray seems to think, is due to a neglect\r\nof varied food scales; but it may also very probably have arisen from\r\nthe neglect of the regulation about lime-juice, either as to issue or\r\nquality, or both. But it is also a fact of very great importance that\r\nmere monotony of diet has a most serious effect upon health; variety\r\nof food is not merely a pandering to gourmandism or greed, but a real\r\nsanitary benefit, aiding digestion and assimilation. Our Board of Trade\r\nhas nothing to do with the food scales of ships, but Mr. Gray hints that\r\nthe Legislature will have to interfere unless shipowners look to it\r\nthemselves. The ease with which preserved foods of all kinds can be\r\nobtained and carried now removes the last shadow of an excuse for\r\nbackwardness in this matter, and in particular the provision of a large\r\nsupply of potatoes, both fresh and dried, ought to be an unceasing care;\r\nthis is done on board American ships, and to this is doubtless owing in\r\na great part the healthiness of their crews. Scurvy in the present\r\nday is a disgrace to shipowners and masters; and if public opinion is\r\ninsufficient to protect the seamen, the legislature will undoubtedly\r\nstep in and do so.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me close by pointing out that the study of this commonplace\r\nmatter of eating and drinking opens out to us the conception of the\r\ngrand unity of nature; since we see that the body of man differs in no\r\nway essentially from other natural combinations, but is subject to\r\nthe same universal physical laws, in which there is no blindness, no\r\nvariableness, no mere chance, and disobedience of which is followed as\r\nsurely by retribution as even the keenest eschatologist might desire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRATTLESNAKE POISON.\r\n\r\nBy HENRY H. CROFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time since, in a paper to which I am unfortunately unable to refer,\r\na French chemist affirmed that the poisonous principle in snakes, or\r\neliminated by snakes, was of the nature of an alkaloid, and gave a name\r\nto this class of bodies.\r\n\r\nMr. Pedler has shown that snake poison is destroyed or neutralized\r\nby means of platinic chloride, owing probably to the formation of an\r\ninsoluble double platinic chloride, such as is formed with almost if not\r\nall alkaloids.\r\n\r\nIn this country (Texas) where rattlesnakes are very common, and persons\r\ncamping out much exposed to their bites, a very favorite anecdote, or\r\n_remedia_ as the Mexicans cull it, is a strong solution of iodine in\r\npotassium iodide.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The solution is applied as soon as possible to the wound,\r\npreferably enlarged, and a few drops taken internally. The common\r\nMexican _remedia_ is the root of the _Agave virginica_ mashed or chewed\r\nand applied to the wound, while part is swallowed.\r\n\r\nGreat faith is placed in this root by all residents here, who are seldom\r\nI without it, but, I have had no experience of it myself; and the\r\ninternal administration is no doubt useless.\r\n\r\nEven the wild birds know of this root; the queer paisano (? ground\r\nwoodpecker) which eats snakes, when wounded by a _vibora de cascabel_,\r\nruns into woods, digs up and eats a root of the agave, just like the\r\nmongoose; but more than that, goes back, polishes off his enemy, and\r\neats him. This has been told me by Mexicans who, it may be remarked, are\r\nnot _always_ reliable.]\r\n\r\nI have had occasion to prove the efficacy of this mixture in two cases\r\nof _cascabel_ bites, one on a buck, the other on a dog; and it occurred\r\nto me that the same explanation of its action might be given as above\r\nfor the platinum salt, viz., the formation of an insoluble iodo compound\r\nas with ordinary alkaloids if the snake poison really belongs to this\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nHaving last evening killed a moderate sized rattlesnake--_Crotalus\r\nhorridus_--which had not bitten anything, I found the gland fully\r\ncharged with the white opaque poison; on adding iodine solution to a\r\ndrop of this a dense light-brown precipitate was immediately formed,\r\nquite similar to that obtained with most alkaloids, exhibiting under the\r\nmicroscope no crystalline structure.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of iodine a good extemporaneous solution for testing\r\nalkaloids, and perhaps a snake poison antidote, may be made by adding a\r\nfew drops of ferric chloride to solution of potassium of iodide; this\r\nis a very convenient test agent which I used in my laboratory for many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAlthough rattlesnake poison could be obtained here in very considerable\r\nquantity, it is out of my power to make such experiments as I could\r\ndesire, being without any chemical appliances and living a hundred miles\r\nor more from any laboratory. The same may be said with regard to books,\r\nand possibly the above iodine reaction has been already described.\r\n\r\nDr. Richards states that the cobra poison is destroyed by potassium\r\npermanganate; but this is no argument in favor of that salt as an\r\nantidote. Mr. Pedler also refers to it, but allows that it would not be\r\nprobably of any use after the poison had been absorbed. Of this I\r\nthink there can be no doubt, remembering the easy decomposition of\r\npermanganate by most organic substances, and I cannot but think that the\r\nmedicinal or therapeutic advantages of that salt, taken internally, are\r\nequally problematical, unless the action is supposed to take place in\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\nIn the bladder of the same rattlesnake I found a considerable\r\nquantity of light-brown amorphous ammonium urate, the urine pale\r\nyellow.--_Chemical News_.\r\n\r\nHermanitas Ranch, Texas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE SIGN MANUAL.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Dr. D. J. Macgowan, in Medical Reports of China. 1881.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo writers in _Nature_, both having for their theme \"Skin-furrows on\r\nthe Hand,\" solicit information on the subject from China.[1] As the\r\nsubject is considered to have a bearing on medical jurisprudence and\r\nethnology as well, this report is a suitable vehicle for responding to\r\nthe demand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Henry Faulds, Tzukiyi Hospital, Tokio, Japan. W. J.\r\nHerschel, Oxford, England.--_Nature_, 28th October and 25th November,\r\n1880.]\r\n\r\nDr. Faulds' observations on the finger-tips of the Japanese have an\r\nethnic bearing and relate to the subject of heredity. Mr. Herschel\r\nconsiders the subject as an agent of Government, he having charge for\r\ntwenty years of registration offices in India, where he employed finger\r\nmarks as sign manuals, the object being to prevent personation and\r\nrepudiation. Doolittle, in his \"Social Life of the Chinese,\" describes\r\nthe custom. I cannot now refer to native works where the practice of\r\nemploying digital rugæ as a sign manual is alluded to. I doubt if its\r\nemployment in the courts is of ancient date. Well-informed natives think\r\nthat it came into vogue subsequent to the Han period; if so, it is in\r\nEgypt that earliest evidence of the practice is to be found. Just as the\r\nChinese courts now require criminals to sign confessions by impressing\r\nthereto the whorls of their thumb-tips--the right thumb in the case of\r\nwomen, the left in the case of men--so the ancient Egyptians, it\r\nis represented, required confessions to be sealed with their\r\nthumbnails--most likely the tip of the digit, as in China. Great\r\nimportance is attached in the courts to this digital form of signature,\r\n\"finger form.\" Without a confession no criminal can be legally executed,\r\nand the confession to be valid must be attested by the thumb-print\r\nof the prisoner. No direct coercion is employed to secure this; a\r\ncontumacious culprit may, however, be tortured until he performs the\r\nact which is a prerequisite to his execution. Digital signatures are\r\nsometimes required in the army to prevent personation; the general\r\nin command at Wenchow enforces it on all his troops. A document thus\r\nattested can no more be forged or repudiated than a photograph--not so\r\neasily, for while the period of half a lifetime effects great changes\r\nin the physiognomy, the rugæ of the fingers present the same appearance\r\nfrom the cradle to the grave; time writes no wrinkles there. In the\r\narmy everywhere, when the description of a person is written down, the\r\nrelative number of volutes and coniferous finger-tips is noted. It\r\nis called taking the \"whelk striæ,\" the fusiform being called \"rice\r\nbaskets,\" and the volutes \"peck measures.\" A person unable to write, the\r\nform of signature which defies personation or repudiation is required in\r\ncertain domestic cases, as in the sale of children or women. Often when\r\na child is sold the parents affix their finger marks to the bill of\r\nsale; when a husband puts away his wife, giving her a bill of divorce,\r\nhe marks the document with his entire palm; and when a wife is sold, the\r\npurchaser requires the seller to stamp the paper with hands and feet,\r\nthe four organs duly smeared with ink. Professional fortune tellers in\r\nChina take into account almost the entire system of the person whose\r\nfuture they attempt to forecast, and of course they include palmistry,\r\nbut the rugæ of the finger-ends do not receive much attention. Amateur\r\nfortune-tellers, however, discourse as glibly on them as phrenologists\r\ndo of \"bumps\"--it is so easy. In children the relative number of volute\r\nand conical striæ indicate their future. \"If there are nine volutes,\"\r\nsays a proverb, \"to one conical, the boy will attain distinction without\r\ntoil.\"\r\n\r\nRegarded from an ethnological point of view, I can discover merely that\r\nthe rugæ of Chinamen's fingers differ from Europeans', but there is so\r\nlittle uniformity observable that they form no basis for distinction,\r\nand while the striæ may be noteworthy points in certain medico-legal\r\nquestions, heredity is not one of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCIDITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of an interesting address lately delivered at the reopening\r\nof the Liverpool University College and School of Medicine, Mr. Matthew\r\nArnold said if there was one word which he should like to plant in the\r\nmemories of his audience, and to leave sticking there after he had gone,\r\nit was the word _lucidity_. If he had to fix upon the three great wants\r\nat this moment of the three principal nations of Europe, he should say\r\nthat the great want of the French was morality, that the great want of\r\nthe Germans was civil courage, and that our own great want was lucidity.\r\nOur own want was, of course, what concerned us the most. People were apt\r\nto remark the defects which accompanied certain qualities, and to think\r\nthat the qualities could not be desirable because of the defects which\r\nthey saw accompanying them. There was no greater and salutary lesson for\r\nmen to learn than that a quality may be accompanied, naturally perhaps,\r\nby grave dangers; that it may actually present itself accompanied by\r\nterrible defects, and yet that it might itself be indispensable. Let him\r\nillustrate what he meant by an example, the force of which they would\r\nall readily feel. Seriousness was a quality of our nation. Perhaps\r\nseriousness was always accompanied by certain dangers. But, at any rate,\r\nmany of our French neighbors would say that they found our seriousness\r\naccompanied by so many false ideas, so much prejudice, so much that was\r\ndisagreeable, that it could not have the value which we attributed to\r\nit. And yet we knew that it was invaluable. Let them follow the same\r\nmode of reasoning as to the quality of lucidity. The French had a\r\nnational turn for lucidity as we had a national turn for seriousness.\r\nPerhaps a national turn for lucidity carried with it always certain\r\ndangers. Be this as it might, it was certain that we saw in the French,\r\nalong with their lucidity, a want of seriousness, a want of reverence,\r\nand other faults, which greatly displeased us. Many of us were inclined\r\nin consequence to undervalue their lucidity, or to deny that they\r\nhad it. We were wrong: it existed as our seriousness existed; it was\r\nvaluable as our seriousness was valuable. Both the one and the other\r\nwere valuable, and in the end indispensable.\r\n\r\nWhat was lucidity? It was negatively that the French have it, and he\r\nwould therefore deal with its negative character merely. Negatively,\r\nlucidity was the perception of the want of truth and validness in\r\nnotions long current, the perception that they are no longer possible,\r\nthat their time is finished, and they can serve us no more. All through\r\nthe last century a prodigious travail for lucidity was going forward\r\nin France. Its principal agent was a man whose name excited generally\r\nrepulsion in England, Voltaire. Voltaire did a great deal of harm in\r\nFrance. But it was not by his lucidity that he did harm; he did it by\r\nhis want of seriousness, his want of reverence, his want of sense for\r\nmuch that is deepest in human nature. But by his lucidity he did good.\r\n\r\nAll admired Luther. Conduct was three-fourths of life, and a man who\r\nworked for conduct, therefore, worked for more than a man who worked for\r\nintelligence. But having promised this, it might be said that the Luther\r\nof the eighteenth century and of the cultivated classes was Voltaire.\r\nAs Luther had an antipathy to what was immoral, so Voltaire had an\r\nantipathy to what was absurd, and both of them made war upon the object\r\nof their antipathy with such masterly power, with so much conviction,\r\nso much energy, so much genius, that they carried their world with\r\nthem--Luther his Protestant world, and Voltaire his French world--and\r\nthe cultivated classes throughout the continent of Europe generally.\r\n\r\nVoltaire had more than negative lucidity; he had the large and true\r\nconception that a number and equilibrium of activities were necessary\r\nfor man. \"_Il faut douner à notre áme toutes les formes possibles_\"\r\nwas a maxim which Voltaire really and truly applied in practice,\r\n\"advancing,\" as Michelet finely said of him, in every direction with\r\na marvelous vigor and with that conquering ambition which Vico called\r\n_mens heroica_. Nevertheless. Voltaire's signal characteristic was his\r\nlucidity, his negative lucidity.\r\n\r\nThere was a great and free intellectual movement in England in the\r\neighteenth century--indeed, it was from England that it passed into\r\nFrance; but the English had not that strong natural bent for lucidity\r\nwhich the French had. Its bent was toward other things in preference.\r\nOur leading thinkers had not the genius and passion for lucidity which\r\ndistinguished Voltaire. In their free inquiry they soon found themselves\r\ncoming into collision with a number of established facts, beliefs,\r\nconventions. Thereupon all sorts of practical considerations began to\r\nsway them. The danger signal went up, they often stopped short, turned\r\ntheir eyes another way, or drew down a curtain between themselves and\r\nthe light. \"It seems highly probable,\" said Voltaire, \"that nature has\r\nmade thinking a portion of the brain, as vegetation is a function of\r\ntrees; that we think by the brain just as we walk by the feet.\" So our\r\nreason, at least, would lead us to conclude, if the theologians did not\r\nassure us of the contrary; such, too, was the opinion of Locke, but he\r\ndid not venture to announce it. The French Revolution came, England grew\r\nto abhor France, and was cut off from the Continent, did great things,\r\ngained much, but not in lucidity. The Continent was reopened, the\r\ncentury advanced, time and experience brought their lessons, lovers of\r\nfree and clear thought, such as the late John Stuart Mill, arose among\r\nus. But we could not say that they had by any means founded among us the\r\nreign of lucidity.\r\n\r\nLet them consider that movement of which we were hearing so much just\r\nnow: let them look at the Salvation Army and its operations. They would\r\nsee numbers, funds, energy, devotedness, excitement, conversions, and\r\na total absence of lucidity. A little lucidity would make the whole\r\nmovement impossible. That movement took for granted as its basis what\r\nwas no longer possible or receivable; its adherents proceeded in all\r\nthey did on the assumption that that basis was perfectly solid, and\r\nneither saw that it was not solid, nor ever even thought of asking\r\nthemselves whether it was solid or not.\r\n\r\nTaking a very different movement, and one of far higher dignity and\r\nimport, they had all had before their minds lately the long-devoted,\r\nlaborious, influential, pure, pathetic life of Dr. Pusey, which had just\r\nended. Many of them had also been reading in the lively volumes of that\r\nacute, but not always good-natured rattle, Mr. Mozley, an account of\r\nthat great movement which took from Dr. Pusey its earlier name. Of its\r\nlater stage of Ritualism they had had in this country a now celebrated\r\nexperience. This movement was full of interest. It had produced men to\r\nbe respected, men to be admired, men to be beloved, men of learning,\r\ngoodness, genius, and charm. But could they resist the truth that\r\nlucidity would have been fatal to it? The movers of all those questions\r\nabout apostolical succession, church patristic authority, primitive\r\nusage, postures, vestments--questions so passionately debated, and on\r\nwhich he would not seek to cast ridicule--did not they all begin by\r\ntaking for granted something no longer possible or receivable, build on\r\nthis basis as if it were indubitably solid, and fail to see that their\r\nbasis not being solid, all they built upon it was fantastic?\r\n\r\nHe would not say that negative lucidity was in itself a satisfactory\r\npossession, but he said that it was inevitable and indispensable, and\r\nthat it was the condition of all serious construction for the future.\r\nWithout it at present a man or a nation was intellectually and\r\nspiritually all abroad. If they saw it accompanied in France by much\r\nthat they shrank from, they should reflect that in England it would\r\nhave influences joined with it which it had not in France--the natural\r\nseriousness of the people, their sense of reverence and respect, their\r\nlove for the past. Come it must; and here where it had been so late in\r\ncoming, it would probably be for the first time seen to come without\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nCapitals were natural centers of mental movement, and it was natural for\r\nthe classes with most leisure, most freedom, most means of cultivation,\r\nand most conversance with the wide world to have lucidity though often\r\nthey had it not. To generate a spirit of lucidity in provincial towns,\r\nand among the middle classes bound to a life of much routine and plunged\r\nin business, was more difficult. Schools and universities, with serious\r\nand disinterested studies, and connecting those studies the one with the\r\nother and continuing them into years of manhood, were in this case the\r\nbest agency they could use. It might be slow, but it was sure. Such\r\nan agency they were now going to employ. Might it fulfill all their\r\nexpectations! Might their students, in the words quoted just now,\r\nadvance in every direction with a marvelous vigor, and with that\r\nconquering ambition which Vico called _mens heroica_! And among the many\r\ngood results of this, might one result be the acquisition in their midst\r\nof that indispensable spirit--the spirit of lucidity!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON SOME APPARATUS THAT PERMIT OF ENTERING FLAMES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A. de Rochas in the _Revue Scientifique_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following notes I shall recall a few experiments that indicate\r\nunder what conditions the human organism is permitted to remain unharmed\r\namid flames. These experiments were published in England in 1882, in the\r\ntwelfth letter from Brewster to Walter Scott on natural magic. They are,\r\nI believe, not much known in France, and possess a practical interest\r\nfor those who are engaged in the art of combating fires.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the last century Humphry Davy observed that, on placing a\r\nvery fine wire gauze over a flame, the latter was cooled to such a\r\npoint that it could not traverse the meshes. This phenomenon, which he\r\nattributed to the conductivity and radiating power of the metal, he soon\r\nutilized in the construction of a lamp for miners.\r\n\r\nSome years afterward Chevalier Aldini, of Milan, conceived the idea of\r\nmaking a new application of Davy's discovery in the manufacture of an\r\nenvelope that should permit a man to enter into the midst of flames.\r\nThis envelope, which was made of metallic gauze with 1-25th of an inch\r\nmeshes, was composed of five pieces, as follows: (1) a helmet, with\r\nmask, large enough, to allow a certain space between it and the internal\r\nbonnet of which I shall speak; (2) a cuirass with armlets; (3) a skirt\r\nfor the lower part of the belly and the thighs; (4) a pair of boots\r\nformed of a double wire gauze; and (5) a shield five feet long by one\r\nand a half wide, formed of metallic gauze stretched over a light iron\r\nframe. Beneath this armor the experimenter was clad in breeches and a\r\nclose coat of coarse cloth that had previously been soaked in a solution\r\nof alum. The head, hands, and feet were covered by envelopes of asbestos\r\ncloth whose fibers were about a half millimeter in diameter. The bonnet\r\ncontained apertures for the eyes, nose, and ears, and consisted of a\r\nsingle thickness of fabric, as did the stockings, but the gloves were of\r\ndouble thickness, so that the wearer could seize burning objects with\r\nthe hands.\r\n\r\nAldini, convinced of the services that his apparatus might render to\r\nhumanity, traveled over Europe and gave gratuitous representations with\r\nit. The exercises generally took place in the following order: Aldini\r\nbegan by first wrapping his finger in asbestos and then with a double\r\nlayer of wire gauze. He then held it for some instants in the flame of\r\na candle or alcohol lamp. One of his assistants afterward put on the\r\nasbestos glove of which I have spoken, and, protecting the palm of his\r\nhand with another piece of asbestos cloth, seized a piece of red-hot\r\niron from a furnace and slowly carried it to a distance of forty or\r\nfifty meters, lighted some straw with it, and then carried it back to\r\nthe furnace. On other occasions, the experimenters, holding firebrands\r\nin their hands, walked for five minutes over a large grating under which\r\nfagots were burning.\r\n\r\nIn order to show how the head, eyes, and lungs were protected by the\r\nwire gauze apparatus, one of the experimenters put on the asbestos\r\nbonnet, helmet, and cuirass, and fixed the shield in front of his\r\nbreast. Then, in a chafing dish placed on a level with his shoulder, a\r\ngreat fire of shavings was lighted, and care was taken to keep it up.\r\nInto the midst of these flames the experimenter then plunged his head\r\nand remained thus five or six minutes with his face turned toward them.\r\nIn an exhibition given at Paris before a committee from the Academic\r\ndes Sciences, there were set up two parallel fences formed of straw,\r\nconnected by iron wire to light wicker work, and arranged so as to leave\r\nbetween them a passage 3 feet wide by 30 long. The heat was so intense,\r\nwhen the fences were set on fire, that no one could approach nearer than\r\n20 or 25 feet; and the flames seemed to fill the whole space between\r\nthem, and rose to a height of 9 or 10 feet. Six men clad in the Aldini\r\nsuit went in, one behind the other, between the blazing fences, and\r\nwalked slowly backward and forward in the narrow passage, while the fire\r\nwas being fed with fresh combustibles from the exterior. One of these\r\nmen carried on his back, in an ozier basket covered with wire gauze, a\r\nchild eight years of age, who had on no other clothing than an asbestos\r\nbonnet. This same man, having the child with him, entered on another\r\noccasion a clear fire whose flames reached a height of 18 feet, and\r\nwhose intensity was such that it could not be looked at. He remained\r\ntherein so long that the spectators began to fear that he had succumbed;\r\nbut he finally came out safe and sound.\r\n\r\nOne of the conclusions to be drawn from the facts just stated is that\r\nman can breathe in the midst of flames. This marvelous property cannot\r\nbe attributed exclusively to the cooling of the air by its passage\r\nthrough the gauze before reaching the lungs; it shows also a very great\r\nresistance of our organs to the action of heat. The following, moreover,\r\nare direct proofs of such resistance. In England, in their first\r\nexperiment, Messrs. Joseph Banks, Charles Blagden, and Dr. Solander\r\nremained for ten minutes in a hot-house whose temperature was 211°\r\nFahr., and their bodies preserved therein very nearly the usual heat. On\r\nbreathing against a thermometer they caused the mercury to fall several\r\ndegrees. Each expiration, especially when it was somewhat strong,\r\nproduced in their nostrils an agreeable impression of coolness, and the\r\nsame impression was also produced on their fingers when breathed upon.\r\nWhen they touched themselves their skin seemed to be as cold as that of\r\na corpse; but contact with their watch chains caused them to experience\r\na sensation like that of a burn. A thermometer placed under the tongue\r\nof one of the experimenters marked 98° Fahr., which is the normal\r\ntemperature of the human species.\r\n\r\nEmboldened by these first results, Blagden entered a hot-house in which\r\nthe thermometer in certain parts reached 262° Fahr. He remained therein\r\neight minutes, walked about in all directions, and stopped in the\r\ncoolest part, which was at 240° Fahr. During all this time he\r\nexperienced no painful sensations; but, at the end of seven minutes, he\r\nfelt an oppression of the lungs that inquieted him and caused him to\r\nleave the place. His pulse at that moment showed 144 beats to the\r\nminute, that is to say, double what it usually did. To ascertain whether\r\nthere was any error in the indications of the thermometer, and to find\r\nout what effect would take place on inert substances exposed to the hot\r\nair that he had breathed, Blogden placed some eggs in a zinc plate in\r\nthe hot-house, alongside the thermometer, and found that in twenty\r\nminutes they were baked hard.\r\n\r\nA case is reported where workmen entered a furnace for drying moulds, in\r\nEngland, the temperature of which was 177°, and whose iron sole plate\r\nwas so hot that it carbonized their wooden shoes. In the immediate\r\nvicinity of this furnace the temperature rose to 160°. Persons not of\r\nthe trade who approached anywhere near the furnace experienced pain in\r\nthe eyes, nose, and ears.\r\n\r\nA baker is cited in Angoumois, France, who spent ten minutes in a\r\nfurnace at 132° C.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the human organism to so high temperatures can be\r\nattributed to several causes. First, it has been found that the quantity\r\nof carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs, and consequently the chemical\r\nphenomena of internal combustion that are a source of animal heat,\r\ndiminish in measure as the external temperature rises. Hence, a conflict\r\nwhich has for result the retardation of the moment at which a living\r\nbeing will tend, without obstacle, to take the temperature of the\r\nsurrounding medium. On another hand, it has been observed that man\r\nresists heat so much the less in proportion as the air is saturated\r\nwith vapors. Dr. Berger, who supported for seven minutes a temperature\r\nvarying from 109° to 110° C. in dry air, could remain only twelve\r\nminutes in a bagnio whose temperature rose from 41° to 51.75°. At the\r\nHammam of Paris the highest temperature obtained is 87°, and Dr. E.\r\nMartin has not been able to remain therein more than five minutes. This\r\nphysician reports that in 1743, the thermometer having exceeded 40° at\r\nPekin, 14,000 persons perished. These facts are explained by the cooling\r\nthat the evaporation of perspiration produces on the surface of the\r\nbody. Edwards has calculated that such evaporation is ten times greater\r\nin dry air in motion than in calm and humid air. The observations become\r\nstill more striking when the skin is put in contact with a liquid or a\r\nsolid which suppresses perspiration. Lemoine endured a bath of Bareges\r\nwater of 37° for half an hour; but at 45° he could not remain in it more\r\nthan seven minutes, and the perspiration began to flow at the end of six\r\nminutes. According to Brewster, persons who experience no malaise near\r\na fire which communicates a temperature of 100° C. to them, can hardly\r\nbear contact with alcohol and oil at 55° and mercury at 48°.\r\n\r\nThe facts adduced permit us to understand how it was possible to bear\r\none of the proofs to which it is said those were submitted who wished\r\nto be initiated into the Egyptian mysteries. In a vast vaulted chamber\r\nnearly a hundred feet long, there were erected two fences formed of\r\nposts, around which were wound branches of Arabian balm, Egyptian thorn,\r\nand tamarind--all very flexible and inflammable woods. When this was set\r\non fire the flames arose as far as the vault, licked it, and gave the\r\nchamber the appearance of a hot furnace, the smoke escaping through\r\npipes made for the purpose. Then the door was suddenly opened before the\r\nneophyte, and he was ordered to traverse this burning place, whose floor\r\nwas composed of an incandescent grating.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Terrason recounts all these details in his historic romance\r\n\"Sethos,\" printed at the end of last century. Unfortunately literary\r\nfrauds were in fashion then, and the book, published as a translation of\r\nan old Greek manuscript, gives no indication of sources. I have sought\r\nin special works for the data which the abbé must have had as a basis,\r\nbut I have not been able to find them. I suppose, however, that\r\nthis description, which is so precise, is not merely a work of the\r\nimagination. The author goes so far as to give the dimensions of the\r\ngrating (30 feet by 8), and, greatly embarrassed to explain how his hero\r\nwas enabled to traverse it without being burned, is obliged to suppose\r\nit to have been formed of very thick bars, between which Sethos had care\r\nto place his feet. But this explanation is inadmissible. He who had the\r\ncourage to rush, head bowed, into the midst of the flames, certainly\r\nwould not have amused himself by choosing the place to put his feet.\r\nBraving the fire that surrounded his entire body, he must have had no\r\nother thought than that of reaching the end of his dangerous voyage as\r\nsoon as possible. We cannot see very well, moreover, how this immense\r\ngrate, lying on the ground, was raised to a red heat and kept at such a\r\ntemperature. It is infinitely more simple to suppose that between the\r\ntwo fences there was a ditch sufficiently deep in which a fire had\r\nalso been lighted, and which was covered by a grating as in the Aldini\r\nexperiments. It is even probable that this grating was of copper,\r\nwhich, illuminated by the fireplace, must have presented a terrifying\r\nbrilliancy, while in reality it served only to prevent the flames from\r\nthe fireplace reaching him who dared to brave them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDING STONE SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of stone as a building material was not resorted to, except to\r\na trifling extent, in this country until long after the need of such a\r\nsolid substance was felt. The early settler contented himself with the\r\nlog cabin, the corduroy road, and the wooden bridge, and loose stone\r\nenough for foundation purposes could readily be gathered from the\r\nsurface of the earth. Even after the desirability of more handsome and\r\ndurable building material for public edifices in the colonial cities\r\nthan wood became apparent, the ample resources which nature had afforded\r\nin this country were overlooked, and brick and stone were imported by\r\nthe Dutch and English settlers from the Old World. Thus we find the\r\ncolonists of the New Netherlands putting yellow brick on their list\r\nof non-dutiable imports in 1648; and such buildings in Boston as are\r\ndescribed as being \"fairly set forth with brick, tile, slate, and\r\nstone,\" were thus provided only with foreign products. Isolated\r\ninstances of quarrying stone are known to have occurred in the last\r\ncentury; but they are rare. The edifice known as \"King's Chapel,\"\r\nBoston, erected in 1752, is the first one on record as being built from\r\nAmerican stone; this was granite, brought from Braintree, Mass.\r\n\r\nGranite is a rock particularly abundant in New England, though also\r\nfound in lesser quantities elsewhere in this country. The first granite\r\nquarries that were extensively developed were those at Quincy, Mass.,\r\nand work began at that point early in the present century. The fame of\r\nthe stone became widespread, and it was sent to distant markets--even to\r\nNew Orleans. The old Merchants' Exchange in New York (afterward used as\r\na custom house) the Astor House in that city, and the Custom House in\r\nNew Orleans, all nearly or quite fifty years old, were constructed of\r\nQuincy granite, as were many other fine buildings along the Atlantic\r\ncoast. In later years, not only isolated public edifices, but also whole\r\nblocks of stores, have been constructed of this material. It was from\r\nthe Quincy quarries that the first railroad in this country was built;\r\nthis was a horse-railroad, three miles long, extending to Neponset\r\nRiver, built in 1827.\r\n\r\nOther points in Massachusetts have been famed for their excellent\r\ngranite. After Maine was set off as a distinct State, Fox Island\r\nacquired repute for its granite, and built up an extensive traffic\r\ntherein. Westerly, R.I., has also been engaged in quarrying this\r\nvaluable rock for many years, most of its choicer specimens having been\r\nwrought for monumental purposes. Statues and other elaborate monumental\r\ndesigns are now extensively made therefrom. Smaller pieces and a coarser\r\nquality of the stone are here and elsewhere along the coast obtained in\r\nlarge quantities for the construction of massive breakwaters to protect\r\nharbors. Another point famous for its granite is Staten Island, New\r\nYork. This stone weighs 180 pounds to the cubic foot, while the Quincy\r\ngranite weighs but 165. The Staten Island product is used not only for\r\nbuilding purposes, but is also especially esteemed for paving after both\r\nthe Russ and Belgian patents. New York and other cities derive large\r\nsupplies from this source. The granite of Weehawken, N.J., is of the\r\nsame character, and greatly in demand. Port Deposit, Md., and Richmond,\r\nVa, are also centers of granite production. Near Abbeville, S.C., and\r\nin Georgia, granite is found quite like that of Quincy. Much southern\r\ngranite, however, decomposes readily, and is almost as soft as clay.\r\nThis variety of stone is found in great abundance in the Rocky\r\nMountains; but, except to a slight extent in California, it is not yet\r\nquarried there.\r\n\r\nGranite, having little grain, can be cut into blocks of almost any size\r\nand shape. Specimens as much as eighty feet long have been taken out and\r\ntransported great distances. The quarrying is done by drilling a series\r\nof small holes, six inches or more deep and almost the same distance\r\napart, inserting steel wedges along the whole line and then tapping each\r\ngently with a hammer in succession, in order that the strain may be\r\nevenly distributed.\r\n\r\nA building material that came into use earlier than granite is known as\r\nfreestone or sandstone; although its first employment does not date back\r\nfurther than the erection of King's Chapel, Boston, already referred to\r\nas the earliest well-known occasion where granite was used in building.\r\nAltogether the most famous American sandstone quarries are those at\r\nPortland, on the Connecticut River, opposite Middletown. These were\r\nworked before the Revolution; and their product has been shipped to many\r\ndistant points in the country. The long rows of \"brownstone fronts\" in\r\nNew York city are mostly of Portland stone, though in many cases the\r\nwalls are chiefly of brick covered with thin layers of the stone. The\r\nold red sandstone of the Connecticut valley is distinguished in geology\r\nfor the discovery of gigantic fossil footprints of birds, first noticed\r\nin the Portland quarries in 1802. Some of these footprints measured\r\nten to sixteen inches, and they were from four to six feet apart. The\r\nsandstone of Belleville, N.J., has also extensive use and reputation.\r\nTrinity Church in New York city and the Boston Atheneum are built of the\r\nproduct of these quarries; St. Lawrence County, New York, is noted also\r\nfor a fine bed of sandstone. At Potsdam it is exposed to a depth of\r\nseventy feet. There are places though, in New England, New York, and\r\nEastern Pennsylvania, where a depth of three hundred feet has been\r\nreached. The Potsdam sandstone is often split to the thinness of an\r\ninch. It hardens by exposure, and is often used for smelting furnace\r\nhearth-stones. Shawangunk Mountain, in Ulster County, yields a sandstone\r\nof inferior quality, which has been unsuccessfully tried for paving;\r\nas it wears very unevenly. From Ulster, Greene, and Albany Counties\r\nsandstone slabs for sidewalks are extensively quarried for city use;\r\nthe principal outlets of these sections being Kingston, Saugerties,\r\nCoxsackie, Bristol, and New Baltimore, on the Hudson. In this region\r\nquantities amounting to millions of square feet are taken out in large\r\nsheets, which are often sawed into the sizes desired. The vicinity of\r\nMedina, in Western New York, yields a sandstone extensively used in that\r\nsection for paving and curbing, and a little for building. A rather poor\r\nquality of this stone has been found along the Potomac, and some of it\r\nwas used in the erection of the old Capitol building at Washington.\r\nOhio yields a sandstone that is of a light gray color; Berea, Amherst,\r\nVermilion, and Massillon are the chief points of production. St.\r\nGenevieve, Mo., yields a stone of fine grain of a light straw color,\r\nwhich is quite equal to the famous Caen stone of France. The Lake\r\nSuperior sandstones are dark and coarse grained, but strong.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country, where neither granite nor sandstone\r\nis easily procured, blue and gray limestone are sometimes used for\r\nbuilding, and, when hammer dressed, often look like granite. A serious\r\nobjection to their use, however, is the occasional presence of iron,\r\nwhich rusts on exposure, and defaces the building. In Western New York\r\nthey are widely used. Topeka stone, like the coquine of Florida and\r\nBermuda, is soft like wood when first quarried, and easily wrought,\r\nbut it hardens on exposure. The limestones of Canton, Mo., Joliet and\r\nAthens, Ill., Dayton, Sandusky, Marblehead, and other points in Ohio,\r\nEllittsville, Ind., and Louisville and Bowling Green, Ky., are great\r\nfavorites west. In many of these regions limestone is extensively used\r\nfor macadamizing roads, for which it is excellently adapted. It also\r\nyields excellent slabs or flags for sidewalks.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal uses of this variety of stone is its conversion, by\r\nburning, into lime for building purposes. All limestones are by no\r\nmeans equally excellent in this regard. Thomaston lime, burned with\r\nPennsylvania coal, near the Penobscot River, has had a wide reputation\r\nfor nearly half a century. It has been shipped thence to all points\r\nalong the Atlantic coast, invading Virginia as far as Lynchburg, and\r\ngoing even to New Orleans, Smithfield, R.I., and Westchester County,\r\nN.Y., near the lower end of the Highlands, also make a particularly\r\nexcellent quality of lime. Kingston, in Ulster County, makes an inferior\r\nsort for agricultural purposes. The Ohio and other western stones yield\r\na poor lime, and that section is almost entirely dependent on the east\r\nfor supplies.\r\n\r\nMarbles, like limestones, with which they are closely related, are very\r\nabundant in this country, and are also to be found in a great variety of\r\ncolors. As early as 1804 American marble was used for statuary purposes.\r\nEarly in the century it also obtained extensive employment for\r\ngravestones. Its use for building purposes has been more recent than\r\ngranite and sandstone in this country; and it is coming to supersede the\r\nlatter to a great degree. For mantels, fire-places, porch pillars, and\r\nlike ornamental purposes, however, our variegated, rich colored and\r\nveined or brecciated marbles were in use some time before exterior walls\r\nwere made from them. Among the earliest marble buildings were Girard\r\nCollege in Philadelphia and the old City Hall in New York, and the\r\nCustom House in the latter city, afterward used for a sub-treasury. The\r\nnew Capitol building at Washington is among the more recent structures\r\ncomposed of this material. Our exports of marble to Cuba and elsewhere\r\namount to over $300,000 annually, although we import nearly the same\r\namount from Italy. And yet an article can be found in the United States\r\nfully as fine as the famous Carrara marble. We refer to that which comes\r\nfrom Rutland, Vt. This state yields the largest variety and choicest\r\nspecimens. The marble belt runs both ways from Rutland County, where\r\nthe only quality fit for statuary is obtained. Toward the north it\r\ndeteriorates by growing less sound, though finer in grain; while to\r\nthe south it becomes coarser. A beautiful black marble is obtained at\r\nShoreham, Vt. There are also handsome brecciated marbles in the same\r\nstate; and in the extreme northern part, near Lake Champlain, they\r\nbecome more variegated and rich in hue. Such other marble as is found\r\nin New England is of an inferior quality. The pillars of Girard\r\nCollege came from Berkshire, Mass., which ranks next after Vermont in\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nThe marble belt extends from New England through New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia, Tennessee, and the\r\nCarolinas, to Georgia and Alabama. Some of the variegated and high\r\ncolored varieties obtained near Knoxville, Tenn., nearly equal that of\r\nVermont. The Rocky Mountains contain a vast abundance and variety.\r\n\r\nSlate was known to exist in this country to a slight extent in colonial\r\ndays. It was then used for gravestones, and to some extent for roofing\r\nand school purposes. But most of our supplies came from Wales. It is\r\nstated that a slate quarry was operated in Northampton County, Pa., as\r\nearly as 1805. In 1826 James M. Porter and Samuel Taylor engaged in the\r\nbusiness, obtaining their supplies from the Kittanninny Mountains. From\r\nthis time the business developed rapidly, the village of Slateford being\r\nan outgrowth of it, and large rafts being employed to float the product\r\ndown the Schuylkill to Philadelphia. By 1860 the industry had reached\r\nthe capacity of 20,000 cases of slate, valued at $10 a case, annually.\r\nIn 1839 quarries were opened in the Piscataquis River, forty miles\r\nnorth of Bangor, Me., but poor transportation facilities retarded the\r\nbusiness. Vermont began to yield in 1852. New York's quarries are\r\nconfined to Washington County, near the Vermont line. Maryland has\r\na limited supply from Harford County. The Huron Mountains, north of\r\nMarquette, Mich., contain slate, which is also said to exist in Pike\r\nCounty, Ga.\r\n\r\nGrindstones, millstones, and whetstones are quarried in New York, Ohio,\r\nMichigan, Pennsylvania, and other States. Mica is found at Acworth and\r\nGrafton, N. H., and near Salt Lake, but our chief supply comes from\r\nHaywood, Yancey, Mitchell, and Macon counties, in North Carolina, and\r\nour product is so large that we can afford to export it. Other stones,\r\nsuch as silex, for making glass, etc., are found in profusion in various\r\nparts of the country, but we have no space to enter into a detailed\r\naccount of them at present.--_Pottery and Glassware Reporter_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most interesting change of which the Census gives account is the\r\nincrease in the number of farms. The number has virtually doubled within\r\ntwenty years. The population of the country has not increased in like\r\nproportion. A large part of the increase in number of farms has been due\r\nto the division of great estates. Nor has this occurred, as some may\r\nimagine, exclusively in the Southern States and the States to which\r\nimmigration and migration have recently been directed. It is an\r\nimportant fact that the multiplication of farms has continued even in\r\nthe older Northern States, though the change has not been as great in\r\nthese as in States of the far West or the South. In New York there has\r\nbeen an increase of 25,000, or 11.5 per cent, in the number of farms\r\nsince 1870; in New Jersey the increase has been 12.2 per cent., and in\r\nPennsylvania 22.7 per cent., though the increase in population, and\r\ndoubtless in the number of persons engaged in farming, has been much\r\nsmaller. Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois also, have been considered fully\r\nsettled States for years, at least in an agricultural point of view, and\r\nyet the number of farms has increased 26.1 per cent, in ten years in\r\nOhio, 20.3 percent, in Indiana, and 26.1 per cent, in Illinois. The\r\nobvious explanation is that the growth of many cities and towns has\r\ncreated a market for a far greater supply of those products which may be\r\nmost advantageously grown upon farms of moderate size; but even if this\r\nfully accounts for the phenomenon, the change must be recognized as one\r\nof the highest importance industrially, socially, and politically. The\r\nman who owns or rents and cultivates a farm stands on a very different\r\nfooting from the laborer who works for wages. It is not a small matter\r\nthat, in these six States alone, there are 205,000 more owners or\r\nmanagers of farms than there were only a decade ago.\r\n\r\nAs we go further toward the border, west or north, the influence of the\r\nsettlement of new land is more distinctly felt. Even in Michigan, where\r\nnew railroads have opened new regions to settlement, the increase in\r\nnumber of farms has been over 55 per cent. In Wisconsin, though the\r\nincrease in railroad mileage has been about the same as in Michigan, the\r\nreported increase in number of farms has been only 28 per cent., but in\r\nIowa it rises to 60 per cent., and in Minnesota to nearly 100 per cent.\r\nIn Kansas the number of farms is 138,561, against 38,202 in 1870; in\r\nNebraska 63,387, against 12,301; and in Dakota 17,435, against 1,720. In\r\nthese regions the process is one of creation of new States rather than a\r\nchange in the social and industrial condition of the population.\r\n\r\nSome Southern States have gained largely, but the increase in these,\r\nthough very great, is less surprising than the new States of the\r\nNorthwest. The prevailing tendency of Southern agriculture to large\r\nfarms and the employment of many hands is especially felt in States\r\nwhere land is still abundant. The greatest increase is in Texas, where\r\n174,184 farms are reported, against 61,125 in 1870; in Florida, with\r\n23,438 farms, against 10,241 in 1870; and in Arkansas, with 94,433\r\nfarms, against 49,424 in 1870. In Missouri 215,575 farms are reported,\r\nagainst 148,228 in 1870. In these States, though social changes have\r\nbeen great, the increase in number of farms has been largely due to new\r\nsettlements, as in the States of the far Northwest. But the change in\r\nthe older Southern States is of a different character.\r\n\r\nVirginia, for example, has long been settled, and had 77,000 farms\r\nthirty years ago. But the increase in number within the past ten years\r\nhas been 44,668, or 60.5 per cent. Contrasting this with the increase in\r\nNew York, a remarkable difference appears. West Virginia had few more\r\nfarms ten years ago than New Jersey; now it has nearly twice as many,\r\nand has gained in number nearly 60 per cent. North Carolina, too, has\r\nincreased 78 per cent. in number of farms since 1870, and South Carolina\r\n80 per cent. In Georgia the increase has been still greater--from 69,956\r\nto 138,626, or nearly 100 per cent. In Alabama there are 135,864\r\nfarms, against 67,382 in 1870, an increase of over 100 per cent. These\r\nproportions, contrasted with those for the older Northern States, reveal\r\na change that is nothing less than an industrial revolution. But the\r\nforce of this tendency to division of estates has been greatest in the\r\nStates named. Whereas the ratio of increase in number of farms becomes\r\ngreater in Northern States as we go from the East toward the Mississippi\r\nRiver, at the South it is much smaller in Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\nMississippi, and Louisiana than in the older States on the Atlantic\r\ncoast. Thus in Louisiana the increase has been from 28,481 to 48,292\r\nfarms, or 70 per cent., and in Mississippi from 68,023 to 101,772 farms,\r\nor less than 50 per cent., against 100 in Alabama and Georgia. In\r\nKentucky the increase has been from 118,422 to 166,453 farms, or 40 per\r\ncent., and in Tennessee from 118,141 to 165,650 farms, or 40 per cent.,\r\nagainst 60 in Virginia and West Virginia, and 78 in North Carolina.\r\nThus, while the tendency to division is far greater than in the Northern\r\nStates of corresponding age, it is found in full force only in six of\r\nthe older Southern States, Alabama, West Virginia, and four on the\r\nAtlantic coast. In these, the revolution already effected foreshadows\r\nand will almost certainly bring about important political changes within\r\na few years. In these six States there 310,795 more farm owners or\r\noccupants than there were ten years ago.--_N.Y. Tribune_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FARMER'S LIME KILN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor information about burning lime we republish the following article\r\nfurnished by a correspondent of the _Country Gentleman_ several years\r\nago:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Fig. 2. Fig. 3. A (Fig. 1), Railway Track--B B B,\r\nIron Rods running through Kiln--C, Capstone over Arch--D, Arch--E, Well\r\nwithout brick or ash lining.]\r\n\r\nI send you a description and sketch of a lime-kiln put up on my premises\r\nabout five years ago. The dimensions of this kiln are 13 feet square by\r\n25 feet high from foundation, and its capacity 100 bushels in 24 hours.\r\nIt was constructed of the limestone quarried on the spot. It has round\r\niron rods (shown in sketch) passing through, with iron plates fastened\r\nto the ends as clamps to make it more firm; the pair nearest the top\r\nshould be not less than 2 feet from that point, the others interspersed\r\nabout 2 feet apart--the greatest strain being near the top. The arch\r\nshould be 7 feet high by 5½ wide in front, with a gather on the top\r\nand sides of about 1 foot, with plank floor; and if this has a little\r\nincline it will facilitate shoveling the lime when drawn. The arch\r\nshould have a strong capstone; also one immediately under the well of\r\nthe kiln, with a hole 2 feet in diameter to draw the lime through; or\r\ntwo may be used with semicircle cut in each. Iron bars 2 inches wide by\r\n1/8 inch thick are used in this kiln for closing it, working in slots\r\nfastened to capstone. These slots must be put in before the caps\r\nare laid. When it is desired to draw lime, these bars may be\r\npushed laterally in the slots, or drawn out entirely, according to\r\ncircumstances; 3 bars will be enough. The slots are made of iron bars\r\n1½ inches wide, with ends rounded and turned up, and inserted in holes\r\ndrilled through capstone and keyed above.\r\n\r\nThe well of the kiln is lined with fire-brick one course thick, with a\r\nstratum of coal ashes three inches thick tamped in between the brick\r\nand wall, which proves a great protection to the wall. About 2,000\r\nfire-bricks were used. The proprietors of this kiln say about one-half\r\nthe lower part of the well might have been lined with a first quality of\r\ncommon brick and saved some expense and been just as good. The form of\r\nthe well shown in Fig. 3 is 7 feet in diameter in the bilge, exclusive\r\nof the lining of brick and ashes. Experiments in this vicinity have\r\nproved this to be the best, this contraction toward the top being\r\nabsolutely necessary, the expansion of the stone by the heat is so\r\ngreat that the lime cannot be drawn from perpendicular walls, as was\r\ndemonstrated in one instance near here, where a kiln was built on that\r\nprinciple. The kiln, of course, is for coal, and our stone requires\r\nabout three-quarters of a ton per 100 bushels of lime, but this, I am\r\ntold, varies according to quality, some requiring more than others; the\r\nquantity can best be determined by experimenting; also the regulation of\r\nthe heat--if too great it will cause the stones to melt or run together\r\nas it were, or, if too little, they will not be properly burned. The\r\nbusiness requires skill and judgment to run it successfully.\r\n\r\nThis kiln is located at the foot of a steep bluff, the top about level\r\nwith the top of the kiln, with railway track built of wooden sleepers,\r\nwith light iron bars, running from the bluff to the top of the kiln, and\r\na hand-car makes it very convenient filling the kiln. Such a location\r\nshould be had if possible. Your inquirer may perhaps get some ideas\r\nof the principles of a kiln for using _coal_. The dimensions may be\r\nreduced, if desired. If for _wood_, the arch would have to be formed for\r\nthat, and the height of kiln reduced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF APPLE JELLY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From the report of the New York Agricultural Society.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the county of Oswego, New York, Dewitt C. Peck reports there are\r\nfive apple jelly factories in operation. The failure of the apple crop,\r\nfor some singular and unexplained reason, does not extend in great\r\ndegree to the natural or ungrafted fruit. Though not so many as common,\r\neven of these apples, there are yet enough to keep these five mills and\r\nthe numerous cider mills pretty well employed. The largest jelly factory\r\nis located near the village of Mexico, and as there are some features in\r\nregard to this manufacture peculiar to this establishment which may be\r\nnew and interesting, we will undertake a brief description. The factory\r\nis located on the Salmon Creek, which affords the necessary power. A\r\nportion of the main floor, first story, is occupied as a saw mill,\r\nthe slabs furnishing fuel for the boiler furnace connected with the\r\nevaporating department. Just above the mill, along the bank of the pond,\r\nand with one end projecting over the water, are arranged eight large\r\nbins, holding from five hundred to one thousand bushels each, into which\r\nthe apples are delivered from the teams. The floor in each of these has\r\na sharp pitch or inclination toward the water and at the lower end is a\r\ngrate through which the fruit is discharged, when wanted, into a trough\r\nhalf submerged in the pond.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the fruit and extraction of the juice proceeds\r\nas follows: Upon hoisting a gate in the lower end of this trough,\r\nconsiderable current is caused, and the water carries the fruit a\r\ndistance of from thirty to one hundred feet, and passes into the\r\nbasement of the mill, where, tumbling down a four-foot perpendicular\r\nfall, into a tank, tight in its lower half and slatted so as to permit\r\nthe escape of water and impurities in the upper half, the apples are\r\nthoroughly cleansed from all earthy or extraneous matter. Such is the\r\nfriction caused by the concussion of the fall, the rolling and rubbing\r\nof the apples together, and the pouring of the water, that decayed\r\nsections of the fruit are ground off and the rotten pulp passes away\r\nwith other impurities. From this tank the apples are hoisted upon an\r\nendless chain elevator, with buckets in the form of a rake-head with\r\niron teeth, permitting drainage and escape of water, to an upper story\r\nof the mill, whence by gravity they descend to the grater. The press\r\nis wholly of iron, all its motions, even to the turning of the screws,\r\nbeing actuated by the water power. The cheese is built up with layers\r\ninclosed in strong cotton cloth, which displaces the straw used in olden\r\ntime, and serves also to strain the cider. As it is expressed from\r\nthe press tank, the cider passes to a storage tank, and thence to the\r\ndefecator.\r\n\r\nThis defecator is a copper pan, eleven feet long and about three feet\r\nwide. At each end of this pan is placed a copper tube three inches in\r\ndiameter and closed at both ends. Lying between and connecting\r\nthese two, are twelve tubes, also of copper, 1½ inches in diameter,\r\npenetrating the larger tubes at equal distances from their upper and\r\nunder surfaces, the smaller being parallel with each other, and 1½\r\ninches apart. When placed in position, the larger tubes, which act as\r\nmanifolds, supplying the smaller with steam, rest upon the bottom of the\r\npan, and thus the smaller pipes have a space of three-fourths of an inch\r\nunderneath their outer surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe cider comes from the storage tank in a continuous stream about\r\nthree-eighths of an inch in diameter. Steam is introduced to the large\r\nor manifold tubes, and from them distributed through the smaller ones at\r\na pressure of from twenty-five to thirty pounds per inch. Trap valves\r\nare provided for the escape of water formed by condensation within the\r\npipes. The primary object of the defecator is to remove all impurities\r\nand perfectly clarify the liquid passing through it. All portions of\r\npomace and other minute particles of foreign matter, when heated,\r\nexpand and float in the form of scum upon the surface of the cider. An\r\ningeniously contrived floating rake drags off this scum and delivers it\r\nover the side of the pan. To facilitate this removal, one side of the\r\npan, commencing at a point just below the surface of the cider, is\r\ncurved gently outward and upward, terminating in a slightly inclined\r\nplane, over the edge of which the scum is pushed by the rake into a\r\ntrough and carried away. A secondary purpose served by the defecator\r\nis that of reducing the cider by evaporation to a partial sirup of the\r\nspecific gravity of about 20° Baume. When of this consistency the liquid\r\nis drawn from the bottom and less agitated portion of the defecator by a\r\nsiphon, and thence carried to the evaporator, which is located upon the\r\nsame framework and just below the defecator.\r\n\r\nThe evaporator consists of a separate system of six copper tubes, each\r\ntwelve feet long and three inches in diameter. These are each jacketed\r\nor inclosed in an iron pipe of four inches internal diameter, fitted\r\nwith steam-tight collars so as to leave half an inch steam space\r\nsurrounding the copper tubes. The latter are open at both ends\r\npermitting the admission and egress of the sirup and the escape of the\r\nsteam caused by evaporation therefrom, and are arranged upon the frame\r\nso as to have a very slight inclination downward in the direction of\r\nthe current, and each nearly underneath its predecessor in regular\r\nsuccession. Each is connected by an iron supply pipe, having a steam\r\ngauge or indicator attached, with a large manifold, and that by other\r\npipes with a steam boiler of thirty horse power capacity. Steam being\r\nlet on at from twenty five to thirty pounds pressure, the stream of\r\nsirup is received from the defecator through a strainer, which removes\r\nany impurities possibly remaining into the upper evaporator tube;\r\npassing in a gentle flow through that, it is delivered into a funnel\r\nconnected with the next tube below, and so, back and forth, through the\r\nwhole system. The sirup enters the evaporator at a consistency of from\r\n20° to 23° Baume, and emerges from the last tube some three minutes\r\nlater at a consistency of from 30° to 32° Baume, which is found on\r\ncooling to be the proper point for perfect jelly. This point is found to\r\nvary one or two degrees, according to the fermentation consequent upon\r\nbruises in handling the fruit, decay of the same, or any little delay in\r\nexpressing the juice from the cheese. The least fermentation occasions\r\nthe necessity for a lower reduction. To guard against this, no cheese\r\nis allowed to stand over night, no pomace left in the grater or vat, no\r\ncider in the tank; and further to provide against fermentation, a large\r\nwater tank is located upon the roof and filled by a force pump, and by\r\nmeans of hose connected with this, each grater, press, vat, tank, pipe,\r\ntrough, or other article of machinery used, can be thoroughly washed and\r\ncleansed. Hot water, instead of cider, is sometimes sent through the\r\ndefecator, evaporator, etc., until all are thoroughly scalded and\r\npurified. If the saccharometer shows too great or too little reduction,\r\nthe matter is easily regulated by varying the steam pressure in the\r\nevaporator by means of a valve in the supply pipe. If boiled cider\r\ninstead of jelly is wanted for making pies, sauces, etc., it is drawn\r\noff from one of the upper evaporator tubes according to the consistency\r\ndesired; or can be produced at the end of the process by simply reducing\r\nthe steam pressure.\r\n\r\nAs the jelly emerges from the evaporator it is transferred to a tub\r\nholding some fifty gallons, and by mixing a little therein, any little\r\nvariations in reduction or in the sweetness or sourness of the fruit\r\nused are equalized. From this it is drawn through faucets, while hot,\r\ninto the various packages in which it is shipped to market. A favorite\r\nform of package for family use is a nicely turned little wooden\r\nbucket with cover and bail, two sizes, holding five and ten pounds\r\nrespectively. The smaller packages are shipped in cases for convenience\r\nin handling. The present product of this manufactory is from 1,500 to\r\n1,800 pounds of jelly each day of ten hours. It is calculated that\r\nimprovements now in progress will increase this to something more than a\r\nton per day. Each bushel of fruit will produce from four to five pounds\r\nof jelly, fruit ripening late in the season being more productive than\r\nearlier varieties. Crab apples produce the finest jelly; sour, crabbed,\r\nnatural fruit makes the best looking article, and a mixture of all\r\nvarieties gives most satisfactory results as to flavor and general\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nAs the pomace is shoveled from the finished cheese, it is again ground\r\nunder a toothed cylinder, and thence drops into large troughs, through a\r\nsuccession of which a considerable stream of water is flowing. Here it\r\nis occasionally agitated by raking from the lower to the upper end of\r\nthe trough as the current carries it downward, and the apple seeds\r\nbecoming disengaged drop to the bottom into still water, while the pulp\r\nfloats away upon the stream. A succession of troughs serves to remove\r\nnearly all the seeds. The value of the apple seeds thus saved is\r\nsufficient to pay the daily wages of all the hands employed in the whole\r\nestablishment. The apples are measured in the wagon box, one and a half\r\ncubic feet being accounted a bushel.\r\n\r\nThis mill ordinarily employs about six men: One general superintendent,\r\nwho buys and measures the apples, keeps time books, attends to all the\r\naccounts and the working details of the mill, and acts as cashier; one\r\nsawyer, who manufactures lumber for the local market and saws the slabs\r\ninto short lengths suitable for the furnace; one cider maker, who grinds\r\nthe apples and attends the presses; one jelly maker, who attends the\r\ndefecator, evaporator, and mixing tub, besides acting as his own fireman\r\nand engineer; one who attends the apple seed troughs and acts as general\r\nhelper, and one man-of-all-work to pack, ship and assist whenever\r\nneeded. The establishment was erected late in the season of 1880,\r\nand manufactured that year about forty-five tons of jelly, besides\r\nconsiderable cider exchanged to the farmers for apples, and some boiled\r\ncider.\r\n\r\nThe price paid for apples in 1880, when the crop was superabundant, was\r\nsix to eight cents per bushel; in 1881, fifteen cents. The proprietor\r\nhopes next year to consume 100,000 bushels. These institutions are\r\nimportant to the farmer in that they use much fruit not otherwise\r\nvaluable and very perishable. Fruit so crabbed and gnarled as to have no\r\nmarket value, and even frozen apples, if delivered while yet solid, can\r\nbe used. (Such apples are placed in the water while frozen, the water\r\ndraws the frost sufficiently to be grated, and passing through the press\r\nand evaporator before there is time for chemical change, they are found\r\nto make very good jelly. They are valuable to the consumer by converting\r\nthe perishable, cheap, almost worthless crop of the bearing and abundant\r\nyears into such enduring form that its consumption may be carried over\r\nto years of scarcity and furnish healthful food in cheap and pleasant\r\nform to many who would otherwise be deprived; and lastly, they are of\r\ngreat interest to society, in that they give to cider twice the value\r\nfor purposes of food that it has or can have, even to the manufacturer,\r\nfor use as a beverage and intoxicant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED GRAPE BAGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt stands to reason that were our summers warmer we should be able to\r\ngrow grapes successfully on open walls; it is therefore probable that\r\na new grape bag, the invention of M. Pelletier, 20 Rue de la Banque,\r\nParis, intended to serve a double purpose, viz., protecting the fruit\r\nand hastening its maturity, will, when it becomes known, be welcomed in\r\nthis country. It consists of a square of curved glass so fixed to\r\nthe bag that the sun's rays are concentrated upon the fruit, thereby\r\nrendering its ripening more certain in addition to improving its quality\r\ngenerally. The glass is affixed to the bag by means of a light iron wire\r\nsupport. It covers that portion of it next the sun, so that it increases\r\nthe amount of light and warms the grapes without scorching them, a\r\nresult due to the convexity of the glass and the layer of air between it\r\nand the bag. M. Pelletier had the idea of rendering these bags cheaper\r\nby employing plain squares instead of curved ones, but the advantage\r\nthus obtained was more than counterbalanced by their comparative\r\ninefficacy. In practice it was found that the curved squares gave an\r\naverage of 7° more than the straight ones, while there was a difference\r\nof 10° when the bags alone were used, thus plainly demonstrating the\r\npractical value of the invention.\r\n\r\nWhether these glass-fronted bags would have much value in the case of\r\ngrapes grown under glass in the ordinary way is a question that can only\r\nbe determined by actual experiment; but where the vines are on walls,\r\neither under glass screens or in the open air, so that the bunches feel\r\nthe full force of the sun's rays, there can be no doubt as to their\r\nutility, and it is probable that by their aid many of the continental\r\nvarieties which we do not now attempt to grow in the open, and which are\r\nscarcely worthy of a place under glass, might be well ripened. At\r\nany rate we ought to give anything a fair trial which may serve to\r\nneutralize, if only in a slight degree, the uncertainty of our summers.\r\nAs it is, we have only about two varieties of grapes, and these not the\r\nbest of the hardy kinds, as regards flavor and appearance, that ripen\r\nout of doors, and even these do not always succeed. We know next to\r\nnothing of the many really well-flavored kinds which are so much\r\nappreciated in many parts of the Continent. The fact is, our outdoor\r\nculture of grapes offers a striking contrast to that practiced under\r\nglass, and although our comparatively sunless and moist climate affords\r\nsome excuse for our shortcomings in this respect, there is no valid\r\nreason for the utter want of good culture which is to be observed in a\r\ngeneral way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--OPEN.]\r\n\r\nGiven intelligent training, constant care in stopping the laterals, and\r\nchecking mildew as well as thinning the berries, allowing each bunch to\r\nget the full benefit of sun and air, and I believe good eatable grapes\r\nwould often be obtained even in summers marked by a low average\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--CLOSED.]\r\n\r\nIf, moreover, to a good system of culture we add some such mechanical\r\ncontrivance as that under notice whereby the bunches enjoy an average\r\nwarmth some 10° higher than they otherwise would do, we not only insure\r\nthe grapes coming to perfection in favored districts, but outdoor\r\nculture might probably be practiced in higher latitudes than is now\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FOR FRONT OF BAG.]\r\n\r\nThe improved grape bag would also offer great facilities for destroying\r\nmildew or guarantee the grapes against its attacks, as a light dusting\r\nadministered as soon as the berries were fairly formed would suffice for\r\nthe season, as owing to the glass protecting the berries from driving\r\nrains, which often accompany south or south-west winds in summer and\r\nautumn, the sulphur would not be washed off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FIXED ON BAG.]\r\n\r\nThe inventor claims, and we should say with just reason, that these\r\nglass fronted bags would be found equally serviceable for the ripening\r\nof pears and other choice fruits, and with a view to their being\r\nemployed for such a purpose, he has had them made of varying sizes and\r\nshapes. In conclusion, it may be observed that, in addition to advancing\r\nthe maturity of the fruits to which they are applied, they also serve to\r\npreserve them from falling to the ground when ripe.--J.

As may be supposed, the only object was to\r\ndemonstrate the possibility of utilizing the concentrated heat of the\r\nsolar rays; but I closely examined it, because the apparatus seems\r\ncapable of great utility in existing circumstances. Here in France,\r\nindeed, there is a radical drawback--the sun is often overclouded.\r\n\r\nThousands of years ago the idea of utilizing the solar rays must have\r\nsuggested itself, and there are still savage tribes who know no other\r\nmode of combustion; but the scientific application has hitherto been\r\nlacking. This void this apparatus will fill up. About fifteen years ago\r\nProfessor Mouchon, of Tours, began constructing such an apparatus, and\r\nhis experiments have been continued by M. Pifre, who has devoted much\r\nlabor and expense to realizing M. Mouchou's idea. A company has now come\r\nto his aid, and has constructed a number of apparatus of different sizes\r\nat a factory which might speedily turn out a large number of them. It is\r\nevident that in a country of uninterrupted sunshine the boiler might be\r\nheated in thirty or forty minutes. A portable apparatus could boil two\r\nand one-half quarts an hour, or, say, four gallons a day, thus supplying\r\nby distillation or ebullition six or eight men. The apparatus can be\r\neasily carried on a man's back, and on condition of water, even of the\r\nworst quality, being obtainable, good drinking and cooking water is\r\ninsured. M. De Rougaumond, a young scientific writer, has just published\r\nan interesting volume on the invention. I was able yesterday to verify\r\nhis statements, for I saw cider made, a pump set in motion, and coffee\r\nmade--in short, the calorific action of the sun superseding that of\r\nfuel. The apparatus, no doubt, has not yet reached perfection, but as it\r\nis it would enable the soldier in India or Egypt to procure in the field\r\ngood water and to cook his food rapidly. The invention is of especial\r\nimportance to England just now, but even when the Egyptian question is\r\nsettled the Indian troops might find it of inestimable value.\r\n\r\nRed tape should for once be disregarded, and a competent commission\r\nforthwith sent to 30 Rue d'Assas, with instructions to report\r\nimmediately, for every minute saved may avoid suffering for Englishmen\r\nfighting abroad for their country. I may, of course, be mistaken, but\r\na commission would decide, and if the apparatus is good the slightest\r\ndelay in its adoption would be deplorable.--_Paris Correspondence London\r\nTimes_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\nBy PROFESSOR L. M. HAUPT.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been\r\nof inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters,\r\nand the explorer over desert wastes. In these, its legitimate uses, the\r\nneedle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate\r\ndetermination of permanent boundary lines have proven very\r\nunsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and\r\neven death.\r\n\r\nFor these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to\r\ndispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle\r\nin surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of\r\ntraversing from a true meridian. This method, however, involves a\r\ngreater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are\r\ngenerally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be\r\nreadily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application\r\nin practice.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written upon the various methods of determining, the\r\ntrue meridian, but it is so intimately related to the determination of\r\nlatitude and time, and these latter in turn upon the fixing of a true\r\nmeridian, that the novice can find neither beginning nor end. When to\r\nthese difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction,\r\ninstrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the\r\nprobable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he learns that time\r\nmay be sidereal, mean solar, local, Greenwich, or Washington, and he is\r\nreferred to an ephemeris and table of logarithms for data, he becomes\r\nlost in \"confusion worse confounded,\" and gives up in despair, settling\r\ndown to the conviction that the simple method of compass surveying is\r\nthe best after all, even if not the most accurate.\r\n\r\nHaving received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I\r\nhave thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the\r\nmethod of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently\r\nclear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make\r\nuse of such information.\r\n\r\nThis will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.\r\n\r\nThe _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all\r\ncelestial objects are projected. Its radius is infinite.\r\n\r\nThe _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves.\r\n\r\nThe _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the\r\nearth, or of the celestial sphere.\r\n\r\nA _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing\r\nthrough the axis. All meridians are therefore north and south lines\r\npassing through the poles.\r\n\r\nFrom these definitions it follows that if there were a star exactly at\r\nthe pole it would only be necessary to set up an instrument and take a\r\nbearing to it for the meridian. Such not being the case, however, we are\r\nobliged to take some one of the near circumpolar stars as our object,\r\nand correct the observation according to its angular distance from the\r\nmeridian at the time of observation.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, the bright star known as Ursæ Minoris or Polaris, is\r\ngenerally selected. This star apparently revolves about the north pole,\r\nin an orbit whose mean radius is 1° 19' 13\",[1] making the revolution in\r\n23 hours 56 minutes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is the codeclination as given in the Nautical Almanac.\r\nThe mean value decreases by about 20 seconds each year.]\r\n\r\nDuring this time it must therefore cross the meridian twice, once above\r\nthe pole and once below; the former is called the _upper_, and the\r\nlatter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_. It must also pass\r\nthrough the points farthest east and west from the meridian. The former\r\nis called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_.\r\n\r\nAn observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points,\r\nor at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too\r\ncomplicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.\r\n\r\nIf the observation were made upon the star at the time of its upper or\r\nlower culmination, it would give the true meridian at once, but this\r\ninvolves a knowledge of the true local time of transit, or the longitude\r\nof the place of observation, which is generally an unknown quantity; and\r\nmoreover, as the star is then moving east or west, or at right angles to\r\nthe place of the meridian, at the rate of 15° of arc in about one hour,\r\nan error of so slight a quantity as only four seconds of time would\r\nintroduce an error of one minute of arc. If the observation be made,\r\nhowever, upon either elongation, when the star is moving up or down,\r\nthat is, in the direction of the vertical wire of the instrument, the\r\nerror of observation in the angle between it and the pole will be\r\ninappreciable. This is, therefore, the best position upon which to make\r\nthe observation, as the precise time of the elongation need not be\r\ngiven. It can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a glance at the\r\nrelative positions of the star Alioth, in the handle of the Dipper,\r\nand Polaris (see Fig. 1). When the line joining these two stars is\r\nhorizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the\r\nlatter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and _vice versa_, thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut since the star at either elongation is off the meridian, it will\r\nbe necessary to determine the angle at the place of observation to be\r\nturned off on the instrument to bring it into the meridian. This angle,\r\ncalled the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the\r\nobserver, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be\r\ncomputed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his\r\n_latitude_ before he can apply it. Let N be the north pole of the\r\ncelestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation;\r\nthen N S=1° 19' 13\", a constant quantity. The azimuth of Polaris at the\r\nlatitude 40° north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60°\r\nnorth, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle\r\nof the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nWe have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_.\r\n\r\nOf the several methods for doing this, we shall select the simplest,\r\npreceding it by a few definitions.\r\n\r\nA _normal_ line is the one joining the point directly overhead, called\r\nthe _zenith_, with the one under foot called the _nadir_.\r\n\r\nThe _celestial horizon_ is the intersection of the celestial sphere by a\r\nplane passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nA _vertical circle_ is one whose plane is perpendicular to the horizon,\r\nhence all such circles must pass through the normal and have the zenith\r\nand nadir points for their poles. The _altitude_ of a celestial object\r\nis its distance above the horizon measured on the arc of a vertical\r\ncircle. As the distance from the horizon to the zenith is 90°, the\r\ndifference, or _complement_ of the altitude, is called the _zenith\r\ndistance_, or _co-altitude_.\r\n\r\nThe _azimuth_ of an object is the angle between the vertical plane\r\nthrough the object and the plane of the meridian, measured on the\r\nhorizon, and usually read from the south point, as 0°, through west, at\r\n90, north 180°, etc., closing on south at 0° or 360°.\r\n\r\nThese two co-ordinates, the altitude and azimuth, will determine the\r\nposition of any object with reference to the observer's place. The\r\nlatter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude\r\nreferred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates.\r\n\r\nThe _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator,\r\nand the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to\r\nthe latitude of the place of observation_.\r\n\r\nLet H P Z Q¹, etc., Fig. 2, represent a meridian section of the sphere,\r\nin which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H¹\r\nwill be the horizon, Q Q¹ the equator, H P will be the altitude of P,\r\nand Q¹ Z the latitude of Z. These two arcs are equal, for H C Z = P C\r\nQ¹ = 90°, and if from these equal quadrants the common angle P C Z be\r\nsubtracted, the remainders H C P and Z C Q¹, will be equal.\r\n\r\nTo _determine the altitude of the pole_, or, in other words, _the\r\nlatitude of the place_.\r\n\r\nObserve the altitude of the pole star _when on the meridian_, either\r\nabove or below the pole, and from this observed altitude corrected for\r\nrefraction, subtract the distance of the star from the pole, or its\r\n_polar distance_, if it was an upper transit, or add it if a lower.\r\nThe result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for\r\nordinary purposes.\r\n\r\nThe time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with\r\nsufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens. The refraction\r\nis _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by\r\nlooking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude. Thus, if the\r\nobserver's altitude should be 40° 39' the nearest refraction 01' 07\",\r\nshould be subtracted from 40° 37' 00\", leaving 40° 37' 53\" for the\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS.\r\n\r\nAs we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the\r\nlatitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the\r\nrequired azimuth. For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical\r\ntriangle, Z S P, Fig. 4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the\r\nnorth pole, and S is Polaris. In this triangle we have given the polar\r\ndistance, P S = 10° 19' 13\"; the angle at S = 90°; and the distance Z\r\nP, being the complement of the latitude as found above, or 90°--L.\r\nSubstituting these in the formula for the azimuth, we will have sin. Z =\r\nsin. P S / sin P Z or sin. of Polar distance / sin. of co-latitude, from\r\nwhich, by assuming different values for the co-latitude, we compute the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n       AZIMUTH TABLE FOR POINTS BETWEEN 26° and 50° N.

It also shows that the azimuth of Polaris at\r\nany one point of observation decreases slightly from year to year. This\r\nis due to the increase in declination, or decrease in the star's polar\r\ndistance. At 26° north latitude, this annual decrease in the azimuth\r\nis about 22\", while at 50° north, it is about 30\". As the variation in\r\nazimuth for each degree of latitude is small, the table is only computed\r\nfor the even numbered degrees; the intermediate values being readily\r\nobtained by interpolation. We see also that an error of a few minutes of\r\nlatitude will not affect the result in finding the meridian, e.g., the\r\nazimuth at 40° north latitude is 1° 43' 21\", that at 41° would be 1° 44'\r\n56\", the difference (01' 35\") being the correction for one degree of\r\nlatitude between 40° and 41°. Or, in other words, an error of one degree\r\nin finding one's latitude would only introduce an error in the azimuth\r\nof one and a half minutes. With ordinary care the probable error of the\r\nlatitude as determined from the method already described need not exceed\r\na few minutes, making the error in azimuth as laid off on the arc of an\r\nordinary transit graduated to single minutes, practically zero.\r\n\r\nREFRACTION TABLE FOR ANY ALTITUDE WITHIN THE LATITUDE OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\n _____________________________________________________\r\n|           |              |           |              |\r\n| Apparent  | Refraction   | Apparent  | Refraction   |\r\n| Altitude. | _minus_.     | Altitude. | _minus_.     |\r\n|___________|______________|___________|______________|\r\n|           |              |           |              |\r\n|    25°    | 0° 2' 4.2\"   |    38°    | 0° 1' 14.4\"  |\r\n|    26     |    1 58.8    |    39     |    1  11.8   |\r\n|    27     |    1 53.8    |    40     |    1   9.3   |\r\n|    28     |    1 49.1    |    41     |    1   6.9   |\r\n|    29     |    1 44.7    |    42     |    1   4.6   |\r\n|    30     |    1 40.5    |    43     |    1   2.4   |\r\n|    31     |    1 36.6    |    44     |    0   0.3   |\r\n|    32     |    1 33.0    |    45     |    0  58.1   |\r\n|    33     |    1 29.5    |    46     |    0  56.1   |\r\n|    34     |    1 26.1    |    47     |    0  54.2   |\r\n|    35     |    1 23.0    |    48     |    0  52.3   |\r\n|    36     |    1 20.0    |    49     |    0  50.5   |\r\n|    37     |    1 17.1    |    50     |    0  48.8   |\r\n|___________|______________|___________|______________|\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn practice to find the true meridian, two observations must be made at\r\nintervals of six hours, or they may be made upon different nights. The\r\nfirst is for latitude, the second for azimuth at elongation.\r\n\r\nTo make either, the surveyor should provide himself with a good transit\r\nwith vertical arc, a bull's eye, or hand lantern, plumb bobs, stakes,\r\netc.[1] Having \"set up\" over the point through which it is proposed to\r\nestablish the meridian, at a time when the line joining Polaris and\r\nAlioth is nearly vertical, level the telescope by means of the attached\r\nlevel, which should be in adjustment, set the vernier of the vertical\r\narc at zero, and take the reading. If the pole star is about making its\r\n_upper_ transit, it will rise gradually until reaching the meridian as\r\nit moves westward, and then as gradually descend. When near the highest\r\npart of its orbit point the telescope at the star, having an assistant\r\nto hold the \"bull's eye\" so as to reflect enough light down the tube\r\nfrom the object end to illumine the cross wires but not to obscure the\r\nstar, or better, use a perforated silvered reflector, clamp the tube in\r\nthis position, and as the star continues to rise keep the _horizontal_\r\nwire upon it by means of the tangent screw until it \"rides\" along this\r\nwire and finally begins to fall below it. Take the reading of the\r\nvertical arc and the result will be the observed altitude.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A sextant and artificial horizon may be used to find the\r\n_altitude_ of a star. In this case the observed angle must be divided by\r\n2.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER METHOD.\r\n\r\nIt is a little more accurate to find the altitude by taking the\r\ncomplement of the observed zenith distance, if the vertical arc has\r\nsufficient range. This is done by pointing first to Polaris when at\r\nits highest (or lowest) point, reading the vertical arc, turning the\r\nhorizontal limb half way around, and the telescope over to get another\r\nreading on the star, when the difference of the two readings will be the\r\n_double_ zenith distance, and _half_ of this subtracted from 90° will be\r\nthe required altitude. The less the time intervening between these two\r\npointings, the more accurate the result will be.\r\n\r\nHaving now found the altitude, correct it for refraction by subtracting\r\nfrom it the amount opposite the observed altitude, as given in the\r\nrefraction table, and the result will be the latitude. The observer must\r\nnow wait about six hours until the star is at its western elongation,\r\nor may postpone further operations for some subsequent night. In the\r\nmeantime he will take from the azimuth table the amount given for his\r\ndate and latitude, now determined, and if his observation is to be made\r\non the western elongation, he may turn it off on his instrument, so\r\nthat when moved to zero, _after_ the observation, the telescope will be\r\nbrought into the meridian or turned to the right, and a stake set by\r\nmeans of a lantern or plummet lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, unnecessary to make this correction at the time of\r\nobservation, for the angle between any terrestrial object and the star\r\nmay be read and the correction for the azimuth of the star applied at\r\nthe surveyor's convenience. It is always well to check the accuracy of\r\nthe work by an observation upon the other elongation before putting in\r\npermanent meridian marks, and care should be taken that they are not\r\nplaced near any local attractions. The meridian having been established,\r\nthe magnetic variation or declination may readily be found by setting\r\nan instrument on the meridian and noting its bearing as given by the\r\nneedle. If, for example, it should be north 5° _east_, the variation is\r\nwest, because the north end of the needle is _west_ of the meridian, and\r\n_vice versa_.\r\n\r\n_Local time_ may also be readily found by observing the instant when the\r\nsun's center[1] crosses the line, and correcting it for the equation of\r\ntime as given above--the result is the true or mean solar time. This,\r\ncompared with the clock, will show the error of the latter, and by\r\ntaking the difference between the local lime of this and any other\r\nplace, the difference of longitude is determined in hours, which can\r\nreadily be reduced to degrees by multiplying by fifteen, as 1 h. = 15°.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: To obtain this time by observation, note the instant of\r\nfirst contact of the sun's limb, and also of last contact of same, and\r\ntake the mean.]\r\n\r\nAPPROXIMATE EQUATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\n     _______________________\r\n    |          |            |\r\n    |   Date.  |  Minutes.  |\r\n    |__________|____________|\r\n    |          |            |\r\n    | Jan.   1 |        4   |\r\n    |        3 |        5   |\r\n    |        5 |        6   |\r\n    |        7 |        7   |\r\n    |        9 |        8   |\r\n    |       12 |        9   |\r\n    |       15 |       10   |\r\n    |       18 |       11   |\r\n    |       21 |       12   |\r\n    |       25 |       13   |\r\n    |       31 |       14   |\r\n    | Feb.  10 |       15   |\r\n    |       21 |       14   |  Clock\r\n    |       27 |       13   |  faster\r\n    | M'ch   4 |       12   |  than\r\n    |        8 |       11   |  sun.\r\n    |       12 |       10   |\r\n    |       15 |        9   |\r\n    |       19 |        8   |\r\n    |       22 |        7   |\r\n    |       25 |        6   |\r\n    |       28 |        5   |\r\n    | April  1 |        4   |\r\n    |        4 |        3   |\r\n    |        7 |        2   |\r\n    |       11 |        1   |\r\n    |       15 |        0   |\r\n    |          |------------|\r\n    |       19 |        1   |\r\n    |       24 |        2   |\r\n    |       30 |        3   |\r\n    | May   13 |        4   |  Clock\r\n    |       29 |        3   |  slower.\r\n    | June   5 |        2   |\r\n    |       10 |        1   |\r\n    |       15 |        0   |\r\n    |          |------------|\r\n    |       20 |        1   |\r\n    |       25 |        2   |\r\n    |       29 |        3   |\r\n    | July   5 |        4   |\r\n    |       11 |        5   |\r\n    |       28 |        6   |  Clock\r\n    | Aug.   9 |        5   |  faster.\r\n    |       15 |        4   |\r\n    |       20 |        3   |\r\n    |       24 |        2   |\r\n    |       28 |        1   |\r\n    |       31 |        0   |\r\n    |          |------------|\r\n    | Sept.  3 |        1   |\r\n    |        6 |        2   |\r\n    |        9 |        3   |\r\n    |       12 |        4   |\r\n    |       15 |        5   |\r\n    |       18 |        6   |\r\n    |       21 |        7   |\r\n    |       24 |        8   |\r\n    |       27 |        9   |\r\n    |       30 |       10   |\r\n    | Oct.   3 |       11   |\r\n    |        6 |       12   |\r\n    |       10 |       13   |\r\n    |       14 |       14   |\r\n    |       19 |       15   |\r\n    |       27 |       16   |  Clock\r\n    | Nov.  15 |       15   |  slower.\r\n    |       20 |       14   |\r\n    |       24 |       13   |\r\n    |       27 |       12   |\r\n    |       30 |       11   |\r\n    | Dec.   2 |       10   |\r\n    |        5 |        9   |\r\n    |        7 |        8   |\r\n    |        9 |        7   |\r\n    |       11 |        6   |\r\n    |       13 |        5   |\r\n    |       16 |        4   |\r\n    |       18 |        3   |\r\n    |       20 |        2   |\r\n    |       22 |        1   |\r\n    |       24 |        0   |\r\n    |          |------------|\r\n    |       26 |        1   |\r\n    |       28 |        2   |  Clock\r\n    |       30 |        3   |  faster.\r\n    |__________|____________|\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OCELLATED PHEASANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe collections of the Museum of Natural History of Paris have just been\r\nenriched with a magnificent, perfectly adult specimen of a species of\r\nbird that all the scientific establishments had put down among their\r\ndesiderata, and which, for twenty years past, has excited the curiosity\r\nof naturalists. This species, in fact, was known only by a few caudal\r\nfeathers, of which even the origin was unknown, and which figured in the\r\ngalleries of the Jardin des Plantes under the name of _Argus ocellatus_.\r\nThis name was given by J. Verreaux, who was then assistant naturalist at\r\nthe museum. It was inscribed by Prince Ch. L. Bonaparte, in his Tableaux\r\nParalléliques de l'Ordre des Gallinaces, as _Argus giganteus_, and a\r\nfew years later it was reproduced by Slater in his Catalogue of the\r\nPhasianidæ, and by Gray is his List of the Gallinaceæ. But it was not\r\ntill 1871 and 1872 that Elliot, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural\r\nHistory, and in a splendid monograph of the Phasianidæ, pointed out\r\nthe peculiarities that were presented by the feathers preserved at the\r\nMuseum of Paris, and published a figure of them of the natural size.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of an individual whose state of preservation leaves\r\nnothing to be desired now comes to demonstrate the correctness of\r\nVerreaux's, Bonaparte's, and Elliot's suppositions. This bird, whose\r\ntail is furnished with feathers absolutely identical with those that\r\nthe museum possessed, is not a peacock, as some have asserted, nor an\r\nordinary Argus of Malacca, nor an argus of the race that Elliot named\r\n_Argus grayi_, and which inhabits Borneo, but the type of a new genus of\r\nthe family Phasianidæ. This Gallinacean, in fact, which Mr. Maingonnat\r\nhas given up to the Museum of Natural History, has not, like the common\r\nArgus of Borneo, excessively elongated secondaries; and its tail is not\r\nformed of normal rectrices, from the middle of which spring two very\r\nlong feathers, a little curved and arranged like a roof; but it consists\r\nof twelve wide plane feathers, regularly tapering, and ornamented with\r\nocellated spots, arranged along the shaft. Its head is not bare, but is\r\nadorned behind with a tuft of thread-like feathers; and, finally, its\r\nsystem of coloration and the proportions of the different parts of its\r\nbody are not the same as in the common argus of Borneo. There is reason,\r\nthen, for placing the bird, under the name of _Rheinardius ocellatus_,\r\nin the family Phasianidæ, after the genus _Argus_ which it connects,\r\nafter a manner, with the pheasants properly so-called. The specific name\r\n_ocellatus_ has belonged to it since 1871, and must be substituted for\r\nthat of _Rheinardi_.\r\n\r\nThe bird measures more than two meters in length, three-fourths of which\r\nbelong to the tail. The head, which is relatively small, appears to be\r\nlarger than it really is, owing to the development of the piliform tuft\r\non the occiput, this being capable of erection so as to form a crest\r\n0.05 to 0.06 of a meter in height. The feathers of this crest are\r\nbrown and white. The back and sides of the head are covered with downy\r\nfeathers of a silky brown and silvery gray, and the front of the neck\r\nwith piliform feathers of a ruddy brown. The upper part of the body is\r\nof a blackish tint and the under part of a reddish brown, the whole\r\ndotted with small white or _café-au-lait_ spots. Analogous spots are\r\nfound on the wings and tail, but on the secondaries these become\r\nelongated, and tear-like in form. On the remiges the markings are quite\r\nregularly hexagonal in shape; and on the upper coverts of the tail\r\nand on the rectrices they are accompanied with numerous ferruginous\r\nblotches, some of which are irregularly scattered over the whole surface\r\nof the vane, while others, marked in the center with a blackish spot,\r\nare disposed in series along the shaft and resemble ocelli. This\r\nsimilitude of marking between the rectrices and subcaudals renders the\r\ndistinction between these two kinds of feathers less sharp than in many\r\nother Gallinaceans, and the more so in that two median rectrices are\r\nconsiderably elongated and assume exactly the aspect of tail feathers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OCELLATED PHEASANT (_Rheinardius ocellatus_).]\r\n\r\nThe true rectrices are twelve in number. They are all absolutely plane,\r\nall spread out horizontally, and they go on increasing in length\r\nfrom the exterior to the middle. They are quite wide at the point of\r\ninsertion, increase in diameter at the middle, and afterward taper to\r\na sharp point. Altogether they form a tail of extraordinary length and\r\nwidth which the bird holds slightly elevated, so as to cause it to\r\ndescribe a graceful curve, and the point of which touches the soil. The\r\nbeak, whose upper mandible is less arched than that of the pheasants,\r\nexactly resembles that of the arguses. It is slightly inflated at the\r\nbase, above the nostrils, and these latter are of an elongated-oval\r\nform. In the bird that I have before me the beak, as well as the feet\r\nand legs, is of a dark rose-color. The legs are quite long and are\r\ndestitute of spurs. They terminate in front in three quite delicate\r\ntoes, connected at the base by membranes, and behind in a thumb that is\r\ninserted so high that it scarcely touches the ground in walking. This\r\nmagnificent bird was captured in a portion of Tonkin as yet unexplored\r\nby Europeans, in a locality named Buih-Dinh, 400 kilometers to the south\r\nof Hué.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDENHAIR TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Maidenhair tree--Gingkgo biloba--of which we give an illustration,\r\nis not only one of our most ornamental deciduous trees, but one of the\r\nmost interesting. Few persons would at first sight take it to be a\r\nConifer, more especially as it is destitute of resin; nevertheless,\r\nto that group it belongs, being closely allied to the Yew, but\r\ndistinguishable by its long-stalked, fan-shaped leaves, with numerous\r\nradiating veins, as in an Adiantum. These leaves, like those of the\r\nlarch but unlike most Conifers, are deciduous, turning of a pale yellow\r\ncolor before they fall. The tree is found in Japan and in China, but\r\ngenerally in the neighborhood of temples or other buildings, and is, we\r\nbelieve, unknown in a truly wild state. As in the case of several other\r\ntrees planted in like situations, such as Cupressus funebris, Abies\r\nfortunei, A. kæmpferi, Cryptomeria japonica, Sciadopitys verticillata,\r\nit is probable that the trees have been introduced from Thibet, or\r\nother unexplored districts, into China and Japan. Though now a solitary\r\nrepresentative of its genus, the Gingkgo was well represented in the\r\ncoal period, and also existed through the secondary and tertiary epochs,\r\nProfessor Heer having identified kindred specimens belonging to sixty\r\nspecies and eight genera in fossil remains generally distributed through\r\nthe northern hemisphere. Whatever inference we may draw, it is at least\r\ncertain that the tree was well represented in former times, if now it\r\nbe the last of its race. It was first known to Kæmpfer in 1690, and\r\ndescribed by him in 1712, and was introduced into this country in the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century. Loudon relates a curious tale as\r\nto the manner in which a French amateur became possessed of it. The\r\nFrenchman, it appears, came to England, and paid a visit to an English\r\nnurseryman, who was the possessor of five plants, raised from Japanese\r\nseeds. The hospitable Englishman entertained the Frenchman only too\r\nwell. He allowed his commercial instincts to be blunted by wine, and\r\nsold to his guest the five plants for the sum of 25 guineas. Next\r\nmorning, when time for reflection came, the Englishman attempted to\r\nregain one only of the plants for the same sum that the Frenchman had\r\ngiven for all five, but without avail. The plants were conveyed to\r\nFrance, where as each plant had cost about 40 crowns, _ecus_, the tree\r\ngot the name of _arbre a quarante ecus_. This is the story as given by\r\nLoudon, who tells us that Andre Thouin used to relate the fact in his\r\nlectures at the Jardin des Plantes, whether as an illustration of the\r\nperfidy of Albion is not stated.\r\n\r\nThe tree is dioecious, bearing male catkins on one plant, female on\r\nanother. All the female trees in Europe are believed to have originated\r\nfrom a tree near Geneva, of which Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secured\r\ngrafts, and distributed them throughout the Continent. Nevertheless, the\r\nfemale tree is rarely met with, as compared with the male; but it is\r\nquite possible that a tree which generally produces male flowers only\r\nmay sometimes bear female flowers only. We have no certain evidence of\r\nthis in the case of the Gingkgo, but it is a common enough occurrence in\r\nother dioecious plants, and the occurrence of a fruiting specimen near\r\nPhiladelphia, as recently recorded by Mr. Meehan, may possibly be\r\nattributed to this cause.\r\n\r\nThe tree of which we give a figure is growing at Broadlands, Hants, and\r\nis about 40 feet in height, with a trunk that measures 7 feet in girth\r\nat 3 feet from the ground, with a spread of branches measuring 45 feet.\r\nThese dimensions have been considerably exceeded in other cases. In 1837\r\na tree at Purser's Cross measured 60 feet and more in height. Loudon\r\nhimself had a small tree in his garden at Bayswater on which a female\r\nbranch was grafted. It is to be feared that this specimen has long since\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to its deciduous character, in which it is\r\nallied to the larch. It presents another point of resemblance both to\r\nthe larch and the cedar in the short spurs upon which both leaves and\r\nmale catkins are borne, but these contracted branches are mingled with\r\nlong extension shoots; there seems, however, no regular alternation\r\nbetween the short and the long shoots, at any rate the _rationale_ of\r\ntheir production is not understood, though in all probability a little\r\nobservation of the growing plant would soon clear the matter up.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is drupaceous, with a soft outer coat and a hard woody shell,\r\ngreatly resembling that of a Cycad, both externally and internally.\r\nWhether the albumen contains the peculiar \"corpuscles\" common to Cycads\r\nand Conifers, we do not for certain know, though from the presence of 2\r\nto 3 embryos in one seed, as noted by Endlicher, we presume this is the\r\ncase. The interest of these corpuscles, it may be added, lies in the\r\nproof of affinity they offer between Conifers and the higher Cryptogams,\r\nsuch as ferns and lycopods--an affinity shown also in the peculiar\r\nvenation of the Gingkgo. Conifers are in some degree links between\r\nordinary flowering plants and the higher Cryptogams, and serve to\r\nconnect in genealogical sequence groups once considered quite distinct.\r\nIn germination the two fleshy cotyledons of the Gingkgo remain within\r\nthe shell, leaving the three-sided plumule to pass upward; the young\r\nstem bears its leaves in threes.\r\n\r\nWe have no desire to enter further upon the botanical peculiarities of\r\nthis tree; enough if we have indicated in what its peculiar interest\r\nconsists. We have only to add that in gardens varieties exist some with\r\nleaves more deeply cut than usual, others with leaves nearly entire, and\r\nothers with leaves of a golden-yellow color.--_Gardeners' Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAIDENHAIR TREE IN THE GARDENS AT BROADLANDS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOODS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA collection of woods without a parallel in the world is now being\r\nprepared for exhibition by the Directors of the American Museum of\r\nNatural History. Scattered about the third floor of the Arsenal, in\r\nCentral Park, lie 394 logs, some carefully wrapped in bagging,\r\nsome inclosed in rough wooden cases, and others partially sawn\r\nlongitudinally, horizontally, and diagonally. These logs represent all\r\nbut 26 of the varieties of trees indigenous to this country, and\r\nnearly all have a greater or less economic or commercial value. The 26\r\nvarieties needed to complete the collection will arrive before winter\r\nsets in, a number of specimens being now on their way to this city from\r\nthe groves of California. Mr. S. D. Dill and a number of assistants are\r\nengaged in preparing the specimens for exhibition. The logs as they\r\nreach the workroom are wrapped in bagging and inclosed in cases, this\r\nmethod being used so that the bark, with its growth of lichens and\r\ndelicate exfoliations, shall not be injured while the logs are in\r\nprocess of transportation from various parts of the country to this\r\ncity. The logs are each 6 feet in length, and each is the most perfect\r\nspecimen of its class that could be found by the experts employed in\r\nmaking the collection. With the specimens of the trees come to the\r\nmuseum also specimens of the foliage and the fruits and flowers of the\r\ntree. These come from all parts of the Union--from Alaska on the north\r\nto Texas on the south, from Maine on the east to California on the\r\nwest--and there is not a State or Territory in the Union which has not a\r\nrepresentative in this collection of logs. On arrival here the logs are\r\ngreen, and the first thing in the way of treatment after their arrival\r\nis to season them, a work requiring great care to prevent them from\r\n\"checking,\" as it is technically called, or \"season cracking,\" as the\r\nunscientific term the splitting of the wood in radiating lines during\r\nthe seasoning process. As is well known, the sap-wood of a tree seasons\r\nmuch more quickly than does the heart of the wood. The prevention of\r\nthis splitting is very necessary in preparing these specimens for\r\nexhibition, for when once the wood has split its value for dressing for\r\nexhibition is gone. A new plan to prevent this destruction of specimens\r\nis now being tried with some success under the direction of Prof.\r\nBickmore, superintendent of the museum. Into the base of the log and\r\nalongside the heart a deep hole is bored with an auger. As the wood\r\nseasons this hole permits of a pressure inward and so has in many\r\ninstances doubtless saved valuable specimens. One of the finest in the\r\ncollection, a specimen of the persimmon tree, some two feet in diameter,\r\nhas been ruined by the seasoning process. On one side there is a huge\r\ncrack, extending from the top to the bottom of the log, which looks as\r\nthough some amateur woodman had attempted to split it with an ax and\r\nhad made a poor job of it. The great shrinking of the sap-wood of the\r\npersimmon tree makes the wood of but trifling value commercially.\r\nIt also has a discouraging effect upon collectors, as it is next to\r\nimpossible to cure a specimen, so that all but this one characteristic\r\nof the wood can be shown to the public in a perfect form.\r\n\r\nBefore the logs become thoroughly seasoned, or their lines of growth at\r\nall obliterated, a diagram of each is made, showing in accordance with\r\na regular scale the thickness of the bark, the sap-wood, and the heart.\r\nThere is also in this diagram a scale showing the growth of the tree\r\nduring each year of its life, these yearly growths being regularly\r\nmarked about the heart of the tree by move or less regular concentric\r\ncircles, the width of which grows smaller and smaller as the tree grows\r\nolder. In this connection attention may be called to a specimen in the\r\ncollection which is considered one of the most remarkable in the world.\r\nIt is not a native wood, but an importation, and the tree from which\r\nthis wonderful slab is cut is commonly known as the \"Pride of India.\"\r\nThe heart of this particular tree was on the port side, and between it\r\nand the bark there is very little sap-wood, not more than an inch.\r\nOn the starbord side, so to speak, the sap-wood has grown out in an\r\nabnormal manner, and one of the lines indicative of a year's growth is\r\none and seven-eighths inches in width, the widest growth, many experts\r\nwho have seen the specimen say, that was ever recorded. The diagrams\r\nreferred to are to be kept for scientific uses, and the scheme of\r\nexhibition includes these diagrams as a part of the whole.\r\n\r\nAfter a log has become seasoned it is carefully sawed through the center\r\ndown about one-third of its length. A transverse cut is then made and\r\nthe semi-cylindrical section thus severed from the log is removed. The\r\nupper end is then beveled. When a log is thus treated the inspector can\r\nsee the lower two-thirds presenting exactly the same appearance it did\r\nwhen growing in the forest. The horizontal cut, through the sap-wood\r\nand to the center of the heart, shows the life lines of the tree, and\r\ncarefully planed as are this portion, the perpendicular and the beveled\r\nsections, the grain of the wood can thus be plainly seen. That these may\r\nbe made even more valuable to the architect and artisan, the right half\r\nof this planed surface will be carefully polished, and the left half\r\nleft in the natural state. This portion of the scheme of treatment is\r\nentirely in the interests of architects and artisans, and it is expected\r\nby Prof. Bickmore that it will be the means of securing for some kinds\r\nof trees, essentially of American growth, and which have been virtually\r\nneglected, an important place in architecture and in ornamental\r\nwood-work, and so give a commercial value to woods that are now of\r\ncomparatively little value.\r\n\r\nAmong the many curious specimens in the collection now being prepared\r\nfor exhibition, one which will excite the greatest curiosity is a\r\nspecimen of the honey locust, which was brought here from Missouri.\r\nThe bark is covered with a growth of thorns from one to four inches\r\nin length, sharp as needles, and growing at irregular intervals. The\r\nspecimen arrived here in perfect condition, but, in order that it might\r\nbe transported without injury, it had to be suspended from the roof of\r\na box car, and thus make its trip from Southern Missouri to this city\r\nwithout change. Another strange specimen in the novel collection is a\r\nportion of the Yucca tree, an abnormal growth of the lily family. The\r\ntrunk, about 2 feet in diameter, is a spongy mass, not susceptible of\r\ntreatment to which the other specimens are subjected. Its bark is an\r\nirregular stringy, knotted mass, with porcupine-quill-like leaves\r\nspringing out in place of the limbs that grow from all well-regulated\r\ntrees. One specimen of the yucca was sent to the museum two years ago,\r\nand though the roots and top of the tree were sawn off, shoots sprang\r\nout, and a number of the handsome flowers appeared. The tree was\r\nsupposed to be dead and thoroughly seasoned by this Fall, but now, when\r\nthe workmen are ready to prepare it for exhibition, it has shown new\r\nlife, new shoots have appeared, and two tufts of green now decorate the\r\notherwise dry and withered log, and the yucca promises to bloom again\r\nbefore the winter is over. One of the most perfect specimens of the\r\nDouglass spruce ever seen is in the collection, and is a decided\r\ncuriosity. It is a recent arrival from the Rocky Mountains. Its bark,\r\ntwo inches or more in thickness, is perforated with holes reaching to\r\nthe-sap-wood. Many of these contain acorns, or the remains of acorns,\r\nwhich have been stored there by provident woodpeckers, who dug the holes\r\nin the bark and there stored their winter supply of food. The oldest\r\nspecimen in the collection is a section of the _Picea engelmanni_, a\r\nspecies of spruce growing in the Rocky Mountains at a considerable\r\nelevation above the sea. The specimen is 24 inches in diameter, and the\r\nconcentric circles show its age to be 410 years. The wood much resembles\r\nthe black spruce, and is the most valuable of the Rocky Mountain\r\ngrowths. A specimen of the nut pine, whose nuts are used for food by the\r\nIndians, is only 15 inches in diameter, and yet its life lines show its\r\nage to be 369 years. The largest specimen yet received is a section of\r\nthe white ash, which is 46 inches in diameter and 182 years old. The\r\nnext largest specimen is a section of the _Platanus occidentalis_,\r\nvariously known in commerce as the sycamore, button-wood, or plane tree,\r\nwhich is 42 inches in diameter and only 171 years of age. Specimens of\r\nthe redwood tree of California are now on their way to this city from\r\nthe Yosemite Valley. One specimen, though a small one, measures 5 feet\r\nin diameter and shows the character of the wood. A specimen of\r\nthe enormous growths of this tree was not secured because of the\r\nimpossibility of transportation and the fact that there would be no room\r\nin the museum for the storage of such a specimen, for the diameter of\r\nthe largest tree of the class is 45 feet and 8 inches, which represents\r\na circumference of about 110 feet. Then, too, the Californians object to\r\nhave the giant trees cut down for commercial, scientific, or any other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nTo accompany these specimens of the woods of America, Mr. Morris K.\r\nJesup, who has paid all the expense incurred in the collection of\r\nspecimens, is having prepared as an accompanying portion of the\r\nexhibition water color drawings representing the actual size, color,\r\nand appearance of the fruit, foliage, and flowers of the various trees.\r\nTheir commercial products, as far as they can be obtained, will also be\r\nexhibited, as, for instance, in the case of the long-leaved pine, the\r\ntar, resin, and pitch, for which it is especially valued. Then, too, in\r\nan herbarium the fruits, leaves, and flowers are preserved as nearly as\r\npossible in their natural state. When the collection is ready for public\r\nview next spring it will be not only the largest, but the only complete\r\none of its kind in the country. There is nothing like it in the world,\r\nas far as is known; certainly not in the royal museums of England,\r\nFrance, or Germany.\r\n\r\nAside from the value of the collection, in a scientific way, it is\r\nproposed to make it an adjunct to our educational system, which requires\r\nthat teachers shall instruct pupils as to the materials used for food\r\nand clothing. The completeness of the exhibition will be of great\r\nassistance also to landscape gardeners, as it will enable them to lay\r\nout private and public parks so that the most striking effects of\r\nfoliage may be secured. The beauty of these effects can best be seen in\r\nthis country in our own Central Park, where there are more different\r\nvarieties and more combinations for foliage effects than in any other\r\narea in the United States. To ascertain how these effects are obtained\r\none now has to go to much trouble to learn the names of the trees. With\r\nthis exhibition such information can be had merely by observation, for\r\nthe botanical and common names of each specimen will be attached to\r\nit. It will also be of practical use in teaching the forester how to\r\ncultivate trees as he would other crops. The rapid disappearance of\r\nmany valuable forest trees, with the increase in demand and decrease in\r\nsupply, will tend to make the collection valuable as a curiosity in\r\nthe not far distant future as representing the extinct trees of the\r\ncountry.--_N.Y.
