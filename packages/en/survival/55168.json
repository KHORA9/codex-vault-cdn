knowledge there has been rapid progress in two\r\ndirections. The commercial exploitation of natural resources, being\r\nfundamental to modern civilization, attracts a liberal share of the\r\ntalents and energies of workers trained for the industrial professions.\r\nA second trend has specialized in the further development of the\r\nsciences which are characteristic of our time. Such activities, in the\r\nnatural history field, deal largely with the refinements of exact\r\ndefinition, nomenclature and classification, all of which means little\r\nor nothing to the layman who is otherwise engaged.\r\n\r\nFor the latter, however, there is a quality of interest which may be\r\ndescribed as a wholesome curiosity about what has happened, how it\r\nhappened, how we know it happened, and what it may signify to one who is\r\nneither industrialist nor scientist. This booklet is intended for the\r\nmany who feel that there is more to be obtained from a natural history\r\nmuseum than an occasional glimpse of a bewildering “marvel.” In addition\r\nto being a guide to fossil exhibits it supplies parts of a great story\r\nwhich specimens alone can not relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE PREHISTORIC RECORD\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that is known of the extinct plants and animals which inhabited the\r\nearth before man began the practice of recording his observations has\r\nbeen obtained from a study of the rocks. The few possible exceptions to\r\nthis rule, in which animal and plant remains have been preserved by\r\nfreezing or drying, are so unusual as to be hardly worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nExplanation of this is that plant and animal tissues quickly decay under\r\nordinary conditions when life ceases. Unless protected from destructive\r\nagencies which are especially active at the surface of the ground, even\r\nthe heavier bones of animals and the large trunks of fallen trees will\r\nsoon crumble into shapeless masses. The usual method employed by nature\r\nto prepare a fossil specimen is so closely related to the natural\r\nprocess of rock making that a little knowledge of that subject will be\r\nnecessary in order to know what fossils are and how they are preserved\r\nfor so long a time.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood first that a fossil is some record, commonly\r\npreserved in rock, of a kind of plant or animal which no longer exists\r\nas a living type. This, at least, is the ordinary sense of the word and\r\nmore elaborate definitions are of small service to anyone. It may be\r\nnecessary to add, however, that all things which have lived at any time\r\nare regarded as either plants or animals.\r\n\r\nNature’s way of producing rocks and fossils remains a mystery to many of\r\nus because we are so wrapped up with the importance of finding names for\r\nthings and materials that we frequently neglect the consideration of\r\nsources and histories. Everyone knows a rock when he sees it in a large\r\nmass, but when he looks at sand, mud, dust, or soil, he seldom thinks of\r\nit as related in any way to rocks. Although the difference is almost\r\nentirely a matter of size, our use of words makes it seem unreasonable\r\nto speak of the finer particles as rock.\r\n\r\nThere can be no reality or meaning in the natural record for an\r\nindividual who has failed to observe a few simple facts which involve\r\nchanges going on in all parts of the world at the present time. With\r\nregard to rocks, it is supposed that what happens in our day also\r\noccurred under like circumstances ages ago. Anyone wishing to do so may\r\nsee for himself that rock masses break down wherever they are exposed to\r\nthe elements, that the larger pieces are reduced to smaller fragments,\r\nand that the final product is sand or dust.\r\n\r\nHe may also note that this finely ground material is being moved and\r\nsorted, by rain, wind, and streams, transported to lower levels and\r\naccumulated in great quantities wherever it finds a resting place. Along\r\nwith it go sticks and leaves, bugs, shells, bones and carcasses of\r\nanimals, some of which in time may become fossils. In large lakes and\r\nseas there is a steady distribution of such materials over broad areas,\r\nyesterday’s accumulation of sediments being buried by the contributions\r\nof today, the most recent of the settlings always resting upon older\r\nones until something happens to disturb that arrangement.\r\n\r\nNot so readily observed are other parts of the process, such as the\r\nconsolidation of sands and muds into the firm sandstones and shales\r\nwhich we again recognize as rocks. Much of this requires more than the\r\nfew score years of a human lifetime for its accomplishment, but many of\r\nus have seen muds become so solidified, by merely drying, that they\r\ncould hardly be distinguished from prehistoric shales. It is to be noted\r\nalso that some ancient fossils come from sandstones which are scarcely\r\nmore rock-like than the loose sands of an ocean beach. Thus we learn\r\nthat firm consolidation of rock-making materials is not always a sign of\r\ngreat antiquity, and that hardness of rock is not always essential to\r\nthe preservation of imbedded plants and animals.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Rhinocerous Bones as Found in the Rock\r\n\r\n    This exhibit was taken from the famous fossil quarry at Agate,\r\n    Nebraska. The fossilized remains are still partially imbedded in the\r\n    sandstone which preserved them for millions of years.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks themselves must explain the many things which have happened\r\nduring the course of millions of years, and this they do remarkably well\r\nwhen carefully studied, for many of the factors involved in their\r\nhistories leave characteristic marks. Changing climates, the draining of\r\nseas, the uplifting of mountain ranges, all have ways of registering\r\ntheir occurrence which are as convincing and reliable as anything ever\r\nwritten by man. Piece by piece the story has been patched together\r\nthrough the efforts of thousands of investigators. Parts of the\r\nnarrative remain buried at inaccessible depths, and whole chapters, no\r\ndoubt, have been destroyed by the same forces that composed this\r\ntremendous record of prehistoric times.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF FOSSILS\r\n\r\nIt would be a serious mistake to regard nature as divided into a number\r\nof distinct and independent schools of fossil making, each refusing to\r\nuse the methods and devices of another. There are, however, certain\r\nfeatures which stand out so prominently that a little classification\r\nbecomes helpful. While this procedure brings out differences it should\r\nbe understood that processes actually work together, several of them\r\nusually being involved in the production of any individual specimen.\r\n\r\n(1) Impressions of animals and plants, or parts of these, are frequently\r\nleft in soft sand or mud which later becomes converted into more durable\r\nrock. This type of fossils is represented by animal foot-prints and the\r\nimprints of leaves, flowers, insects, and like objects which may be\r\nmingled with the finely ground materials of the common sedimentary\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n(2) Parts of plants and animals may be gradually replaced by mineral\r\nmatter with little or no change from original form and texture. Fossils\r\nof this class are said to be petrified or turned to stone. They are also\r\nknown as replacements. The fleshy parts of animals do not petrify.\r\n\r\n(3) Many animals among the invertebrates use mineral substances for\r\nprotective or supporting structures. Small plants of various kinds\r\nfollow a similar practice. These structures, being produced in stony\r\nmaterials, are readily converted into fossils. The shells of mollusks\r\nare the best known illustrations in this field, and all that is required\r\nfor a shell to become a fossil is the extinction of the species of\r\nanimal that produced it. Fossils of this type are extremely abundant.\r\n\r\n(4) Preservative substances other than those which produce common rocks\r\nmay be mentioned among fossil-making possibilities. Bones are known to\r\nhave been preserved in asphalt, and insects in resins, but such cases\r\nare few in comparison with the products of other methods.\r\n\r\n(5) In rare instances there has been preservation of extinct creatures\r\nby the process of drying or by refrigeration. Occasional mummies are\r\nfound with shriveled flesh and skin still in place, but better\r\npreservation of all tissues occurs when the temperature is quickly\r\nreduced below freezing point and held there without interruption. This\r\ncan happen only in the colder parts of the earth and is always subject\r\nto climatic change. The effect of drying also may be undone at any time\r\nby a slight increase in the amount of moisture.\r\n\r\n(6) Coal beds often produce fossils of an unusual sort. In the formation\r\nof coal, plant material gradually loses some of its more perishable\r\nsubstances but retains carbon which has better lasting qualities and\r\nslowly accumulates to produce the seams and beds that are mined. In the\r\nearly stages of the process the original vegetation undergoes little\r\nchange in appearance but eventually practically all of its character is\r\nlost. Many fossil leaves are found as thin layers of carbon, bedded in\r\nthe clays which are commonly associated with coal deposits.\r\n\r\n(7) Concretions, which are hardened lumps of mineral substances\r\noccurring commonly in sandstones and shales, are often mistaken for\r\nfossils because of their peculiar shapes. However, there are localities\r\nin which the mineral solutions have been concentrated and deposited\r\naround shells, leaves, seeds, or similar objects, thus producing an\r\nabundance of fossils which may be obtained by opening the concretions.\r\nFossils of this type are well known from Mazon Creek and other districts\r\nin Illinois, Kansas, Colorado, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSILIZATION\r\n\r\nFootprints need little explanation other than a consideration of the\r\nfactors which make it possible for them to be preserved. The sand or mud\r\nmust be neither too soft nor too hard to take the form of the foot and\r\nretain its shape when the foot is withdrawn. Then in some manner the\r\nimpression must be protected while the rock-making process goes on. When\r\nsuch protection is obtained it is usually in the form of more mud and\r\nsand, deposited over the surface which received the impression. At a\r\nlater time the covering may be separated from the lower part of the\r\ndeposit, which serves as a mold, and if the separation be accomplished\r\nsuccessfully a natural cast of the foot will be obtained as well as the\r\nmold in which it was produced. Since conditions for perfect work are not\r\nalways present in a laboratory of this kind, it is not surprising that\r\nfossil footprints are very rare considering the number and variety of\r\ntracks left by wandering animals.\r\n\r\nImpressions of leaves are explained in much the same way except that the\r\nleaf remains under its protective covering until it decays. Similar\r\nimpressions may be obtained from the bodies of delicate invertebrate\r\nanimals but they are seldom preserved because of the softness of the\r\ntissues. The smaller fishes provide much better material for the\r\nproduction of fossils according to this method. While the fish is being\r\nflattened by the weight of surrounding sediments, scales, fins, and soft\r\nbones retain their positions and provide the necessary resistance to\r\nleave an impression of the body form when the flesh is gone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Insect Fossils (enlarged)\r\n\r\n    Fine specimens of this type are obtained from an old lake bed at\r\n    Florissant, Colorado.]\r\n\r\nThe larger and more spectacular fossils, such as skeletons, skulls, and\r\ndetached bones are nearly always of the replacement type. Replacement of\r\nplant and animal substances by mineral matter is a slow process and in\r\nyounger fossils the change is rarely completed, some of the original\r\nmaterial being present in a partially altered condition or not modified\r\nat all. Since air does not often carry the necessary materials and\r\nprovide other essential conditions, replacement may be regarded as\r\nsomething which happens underground or in water. It is perhaps best\r\nexplained in connection with limestones, because calcite or “lime” is\r\nfrequently the replacing substance although other minerals, especially\r\nquartz, may serve the purpose.\r\n\r\nBesides converting bony or woody objects into rock substance, mineral\r\nreplacements may assist in the production and preservation of fossils in\r\nanother manner. It often results in the filing of cavities with some\r\nrock-making substance which retards destruction through crushing or\r\nother injury. In many cases, so-called fossil shells are not shells at\r\nall; instead, they are merely a stony filling which was once surrounded\r\nby shell substance. In other instances the original shell remains as it\r\nwas during the life of its former occupant, preservation of the shell\r\nbeing due largely to the substitution of a mineral filler for the soft\r\nanimal tissues once present.\r\n\r\nLimestone comes into existence through a more elaborate process than\r\nthat which produces sandstone and shales. It is one of the three types\r\nof common rocks, known collectively as the sedimentaries, in which\r\nfossils are found. It differs from sandstones and shales, however, in\r\nthat much of its substance has been dissolved in water instead of being\r\ntransported in the form of finely ground rock particles. Lime occurs in\r\nmany varieties of rock which are exposed to the wear and tear of the\r\nelements throughout the world. Slowly but more or less continuously it\r\nis taken from this source by ground and surface waters coming in contact\r\nwith it. Particularly active is carbonated water, moving underground\r\nthrough pores and crevices.\r\n\r\nThis underground circulation of mineral matter in a dissolved condition\r\nexplains the occurrence of fossils in land areas which have not\r\nnecessarily been submerged during any great length of time, for it is\r\nwell known that plant and animal remains are not invariably washed into\r\nlakes or seas, and that all sedimentary deposits have not been built up\r\nin large bodies of water. Here we are dealing with what is known as the\r\ncontinental type of sedimentation and such fossils as dinosaurs,\r\nmastodons, three-toed horses, and other former inhabitants of land\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nIn order to become properly fossilized, certain conditions are\r\nabsolutely necessary, and only a small percentage of the once-living\r\nmultitude secures the required treatment. There must be present, soon\r\nafter death, some protection from the activities of the carnivorous\r\nbirds and beasts that would separate and scatter the parts of a carcass,\r\nalso from the smaller gnawing animals that would continue the\r\ndestruction, and finally from wind, sun, rain, frost, and bacterial and\r\nchemical activities which in the course of only a few years would remove\r\neverything but possibly a few scraps of tooth enamel, which is the\r\nhardest of animal tissues.\r\n\r\nA slight covering of earth substance in any form serves to check the\r\ndisintegration, and this may be acquired in several ways. Animals that\r\nperish in bogs or quicksands are soon covered over; in many localities\r\nwind-blown dust and sand do the work; and flooded river valleys provide\r\nan abundance of mud for the necessary burial of others. Even\r\nunderground, the decay of soft tissues is too rapid to permit of\r\nreplacement by mineral substance in a manner that would reproduce form\r\nand texture. Skin and flesh are almost invariably lost, although in a\r\nfew instances the thick scaly hides of dinosaurs are known to have\r\nproduced natural molds and casts by the method explained in connection\r\nwith footprints and other impressions.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The skeleton of this prehistoric American rhinoceros\r\n    is mounted in a “half shell” which was modeled over the bones to\r\n    show the form of the living animal. The artist’s reconstruction\r\n    appears in the painting above the fossil exhibit.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the more durable tissues found in the teeth, bones, and\r\nshells of animals, or the woody parts of plants, the case is different.\r\nThese parts become firmly imbedded in the ground, but moisture still has\r\naccess, and it begins to work immediately; for all water moving\r\nunderground finds soluble substances which it picks up and carries with\r\nit wherever it goes, and much of the load consists of mineral matter\r\nwhich may be unloaded again when the necessary conditions are found.\r\n\r\nMineral-laden waters will drop one kind of substance to take up another\r\nwhich dissolves more readily, and this happens sooner or later when a\r\nburied bone or log is encountered. Complications of various sorts enter\r\ninto the process, but the final outcome frequently is a complete change\r\nfrom one chemical composition to another which is more enduring, the\r\ntransformation being brought about so gradually and thoroughly that in\r\nmany fossils the inner structure of the original tissue is as accurately\r\nreproduced as the fine detail of surface features.\r\n\r\nConverted into stone, however, the result is still far from permanent.\r\nWhile yet underground the fossil is subjected to distortion and breakage\r\ndue to earth movements which bend and dislocate the rock deposits. What\r\ncauses these upheavals and depressions of the earth’s surface remains\r\nthe subject of much discussion, but that they have occurred on a large\r\nscale and continue to occur is clearly evident. At higher altitudes the\r\nsurface rocks and fossils are exposed to a larger variety of destructive\r\nactivities than at lower levels where protective coverings are more\r\nlikely to be provided and retained. Once stripped of that protection\r\nthere is little chance for a fossil to survive. Beyond a doubt there are\r\nmany thousands of tons of prehistoric remains damaged or destroyed each\r\nyear, by weather and stream erosion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORAS AND FAUNAS\r\n\r\nAs the various types of sediments continue to accumulate on land and in\r\nwater they produce deposits of sandstones, claystones, and limestones\r\nwhich in time may acquire great thickness and cover wide areas of sea\r\nfloor, or continental surface. Usually there is more or less mixing of\r\nsediments resulting in sandy limestones, limy clays, and other\r\ncombinations. Quite commonly, however, the types remain fairly pure but\r\nbecome arranged in layers which alternate from one kind of material to\r\nanother. At all times the character of the deposit will depend upon the\r\nnature of the rocks which supply the materials, and any fossils that may\r\nbe produced will consist of such plants and animals as live and die\r\nduring the time the rock is in the making.\r\n\r\nSome of the rock layers will be rich in plant and animal remains, others\r\nquite barren, the difference being due partly to conditions influencing\r\nthe life of the region. In addition, the character and amount of\r\nrock-making materials at the time may be favorable or unfavorable to the\r\npreservation of fossils. Seas, lakes, and valleys may at any time be\r\ndrained, or enlarged and deepened, by changes in the elevation of\r\nunderlying rocks. The amount and variety of mineral substances dissolved\r\nin the waters of a region not only affect the character of rock deposits\r\nbut also the plants and animals living in the water. Some of these\r\nchemical solutions provide cementing materials which bind together the\r\ngrains of sands and mud; others have a detrimental effect upon cementing\r\nmaterial previously deposited, and so construction and destruction go on\r\ncontinuously, more or less hand in hand, to produce complicated and\r\noften puzzling results.\r\n\r\nA little more salt, or a little less of it, may change completely the\r\nvariety of life inhabiting a body of water. A slight change in the depth\r\nof the water often accomplishes the same thing, for plants and animals\r\nare so delicately adjusted to their environments that conditions fatal\r\nto one race of creatures may provide the exact life requirement of\r\nanother. This is a matter of practical knowledge which is being used\r\ntoday in the cultivation of plants and animals for market purposes. It\r\nis being demonstrated continuously, also, upon living subjects in\r\nexperimental laboratories throughout the world; and, in a bigger way,\r\nthe facts are observable wherever life is considered in relation to\r\nhabitat. That anything so obvious should be regarded as guesswork or\r\ntheorizing, or opposed to truth, when applied to former inhabitants of\r\nthe earth, is somewhat surprising. And, it may be added, the cultural\r\nworth of fossil study comes to a focus on this very point, for men and\r\nwomen are now meddling, consciously or unconsciously, wisely or\r\nunwisely, with an all-important environment about which they have\r\nlearned very little—one called, among other things, “civilization.”\r\n\r\nFor any portion of the world a complete-list of the different kinds of\r\nplant inhabitants comprises the _flora_ of that region, and a like\r\nsummary for the animal life is known as the _fauna_ of the district. It\r\nis generally understood that different species of both plants and\r\nanimals inhabit different regions of the earth, but outside of\r\nprofessional circles it is only beginning to be recognized that changes\r\nin floras and faunas occur from time to time, that slight differences\r\nmay be noted in the course of observations extending over a period of\r\nonly a few years, and that everything in a fauna or flora eventually may\r\nbe displaced by new forms.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, a convenient practice to use these terms in connection\r\nwith time periods, rock beds, and types of environment, as well as\r\ngeographical areas. Thus we have such phrases as a “Cretaceous fauna”\r\n(attaching the name of a geologic period), a “Benton fauna” (with\r\nreference to the fossils of a rock formation), a “marine flora” (using\r\nthe name of an environment), an “Arctic flora” (which applies to a\r\ndefinite portion of the earth surface and its plant inhabitants).\r\n\r\nFaunas include animals which many persons do not recognize as such.\r\nSponges, corals, insects, worms, crabs, oysters, and a host of other\r\nboneless creatures are grouped together as _invertebrate_ animals, while\r\nanother group includes the fishes, amphibians (toads, frogs, and\r\nsalamanders of today), reptiles (crocodiles, lizards, snakes, and\r\nturtles being well known varieties), birds, and mammals. This second\r\nlot, provided with backbones and skeletons, comprise the great division\r\nof _vertebrate_ animals.\r\n\r\nFloras also include types which are commonly seen but not popularly\r\nidentified as plants. The algae are perhaps best known as seaweeds,\r\nwater-silk, and pond scums; fungi as toadstools and moulds. Both groups\r\nare large and of important rank in the vegetable kingdom; only the\r\nalgae, however, are recognized as important fossil producers. Better\r\nknown types of plants are the mosses, ferns, evergreens, grasses, and\r\nthe more conspicuous flower-bearing forms, from weed size to tree size.\r\n\r\nMany rocks owe their character to the work of large colonies of plants\r\nor animals, for the living organisms are frequently the active agency\r\nwhich takes dissolved mineral substance from the solvent liquid and gets\r\nit back into solid form. The liquid is, of course, the water in which\r\nthe creatures live, while the mineral substance often becomes a\r\ncommodity required by a plant or animal in its mode of living. Mollusks\r\nhave a way of using lime in the production of shells, and many a bed of\r\nlimestone consists almost entirely of this by-product of molluscan life.\r\nTiny coral polyps build complicated and beautiful structures from the\r\nsame mineral substance. Either intact or in broken condition, these\r\nstructures contribute in a large way to the making of limestones. Algae,\r\namong the lowliest of plants, have done extensive work along similar\r\nlines, and numerous invertebrate animals could be named as important\r\nfactors in the production of rocks. Many of the shells and other\r\nfabrications retain their peculiar patterns long after the extermination\r\nof their makers, and a highly informative part of the fossil record is\r\nprovided in this manner. It is also by far the larger portion of the\r\nrecord, for the earlier ages of prehistoric time failed to produce a\r\nvertebrate animal of any kind, while the invertebrate record dates back\r\nto pre-Cambrian time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATIONS\r\n\r\nIf in some part of North America there had been steady accumulation of\r\nsedimentary materials under constantly favorable conditions since the\r\nbeginning of Cambrian time, the result would have been a deposit of\r\nsandstones, claystones, and limestones measuring nearly fifty miles from\r\nbottom to top. These figures are based on actual production in North\r\nAmerica where extensive measurements have been made in many localities.\r\nWhen other parts of the world are as thoroughly investigated and older\r\ndeposits included in the calculations, the total thickness of such beds\r\nwill probably be more than one hundred miles.\r\n\r\nNo single pile of rocks offering a complete cross section of the\r\ngeological record has ever been produced, but portions of the section\r\nare exposed to view on all the continents. In order to carry on\r\ndesirable investigations and make comparisons, it has been necessary to\r\ndivide this great composite section into small units which may be named\r\nin some way and placed definitely with relation to lower and higher, or\r\nolder and younger, layers. To serve this purpose there has been\r\ndeveloped the idea of rock _formations_, and here we have a word which\r\nis not defined readily, even for the use of those who are familiar with\r\nit. Nevertheless it is used so commonly that some understanding of its\r\nmeaning becomes desirable.\r\n\r\nA _formation_ may be regarded as an extensive rock mass, variable, in\r\nthickness and other proportions, as well as in composition, but\r\nrepresenting a period of time during which there was no great change in\r\nthe character of plant and animal life, and no serious interruption in\r\nthe depositing of the rock-making materials. Occasionally the lower and\r\nupper limits of a formation are well defined and readily located.\r\nFrequently, however, the transition is gradual, one formation merging\r\ninto another with no apparent mark of separation. In such event the\r\noriginal description serves to establish more or less definitely the\r\nboundaries of a formation.\r\n\r\nDescriptions are published whenever a worker believes he has discovered\r\na significant part of the great section which has not previously been\r\nnamed. The usual practice is to apply a name taken from the locality in\r\nwhich the beds were investigated, and in this manner the names of\r\nformations become associated with towns, rivers, counties, mountains,\r\nstates and other geographical features. The locality which supplies the\r\nname is then regarded as the “type locality” for the formation, but\r\nwherever these same beds may be traced or otherwise identified the one\r\nformation name applies.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Dinosaur Tracks\r\n\r\n    An ancient trail in sandstone of the Dakota formation. East slope of\r\n    the hogback, west of Denver.]\r\n\r\nThe “Dakota formation,” to use a convenient illustration, is mentioned\r\nin scores of reports bearing on the geology of Colorado, Iowa, Kansas,\r\nNebraska, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, as well as the Dakotas.\r\nOn the geological map of Colorado it appears on both sides of the\r\nRockies, scattered in strips and patches from north to south boundary\r\nlines. The beds are easily located in the foothills district west of\r\nDenver because of their tendency to produce the prominent ridges known\r\nas hogbacks.\r\n\r\nMany formations are exposed over much less territory, some have even\r\ngreater extent. Thickness may vary from a few inches to thousands of\r\nfeet, and no two exposures will be exactly alike though some similarity\r\nnecessarily prevails throughout. “Exposures” are simply portions of the\r\nbeds which are not concealed by loose rock, soil and vegetation, or\r\noverlying formations. Canyon walls, steep cliffs and mountain slopes,\r\ngullies, and badlands provide a large variety of natural exposures. In\r\nsuch places rocks and fossils may be studied to best advantage.\r\n\r\nSince a formation may contain a variety of beds, including sandstones,\r\nshales, limestones, and all sorts of mixtures, there is sometimes need\r\nof subdividing it; but formations are the smallest units commonly shown\r\non geological maps. They are actual rocks which fit into a historical\r\nscheme of things and may be regarded aptly as the pages of a book which\r\nnature has done in stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL TIME\r\n\r\n“How old are they?” “How can you learn their names from the rocks?”\r\nThese are typical examples of questions most frequently asked concerning\r\nfossils. The second question follows the usual reply to the first, for\r\nprehistoric plants and animals are as old as the rocks in which they are\r\nfound. The answer, as to age, must come from the rocks and what we have\r\nlearned about them through many years of hard work, thoughtful\r\nobservation, and careful study. Names, however, come from a different\r\nsource. Nature, apparently, managed for a long time to carry on without\r\nthe use of words. Since man began talking he has had no trouble\r\ninventing names for things which interest him.\r\n\r\nEarly students of rocks and fossils likewise accomplished a great deal\r\nwithout being able to date events in terms of years although many of\r\ntheir efforts and interests centered on the problem of discovering a\r\ncontinuous sequence of events in the fragments of evidence that had been\r\nuncovered. This relatively simple problem has not been fully worked out,\r\nand some of the breaks in the record are recognized as “time gaps” which\r\nmay never be converted into history.\r\n\r\nThe question of time, expressed in years, has been a puzzle which\r\nattracted some attention even in the earliest days of investigation. Its\r\nsolution was attempted by several methods long before there was\r\nsufficient information to make them work satisfactorily, which accounts\r\nin part for the extreme variation in results of the calculations. Even\r\nnow it is to be expected that changes will have to be made as long as\r\npertinent studies are continued. Two of the most promising methods of\r\ninvestigation in late years have been producing figures which are\r\nsurprisingly large. More accuracy than ever before is probably present\r\nin modern estimates but, except for comparatively recent time, there is\r\nyet no way of knowing within a range of millions of years when a\r\ncreature lived.\r\n\r\nAstronomy and physics were used in early calculations but, although\r\ntaken seriously by some geologists, it was soon recognized by others\r\nthat certain events revealed by earth history could not be explained\r\nwith so short a time allowance as these methods indicated. One of the\r\nfirst estimates provided a total of only twenty-five millions of years\r\nand included a great stretch of time during which the earth, according\r\nto prevailing theory, was more sun-like than rock-like, a time when\r\nplanets were being born and the earth could not have been in its present\r\nphysical condition, which is the chief concern of the geologist. Since\r\nthose earlier conditions could not have supported life as we know it,\r\nour knowledge of cosmic history renders small service in the study of\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\nAmong the methods suggested by astronomy and the laws of physics is one\r\nwhich is based on the probable rate at which the earth cooled from its\r\nmolten condition to present temperature. It is believed now that the\r\nheat of the earth is not necessarily due to an original molten state and\r\nthat a steady rate of cooling cannot be ascertained. Any figures based\r\non such procedure, therefore, are discredited today.\r\n\r\nThe amount of salt in the oceans, and the time required for its\r\nconcentration there by natural processes, offers another way of\r\nattacking the problem. It is a well known fact that salt is being added\r\nto the seas at a fairly constant rate; sea water, then, must become\r\nsaltier from year to year. The salt comes from rocks exposed on land\r\nsurfaces and is transported by the rivers which drain these areas. By\r\nanalyzing the river waters it is possible to estimate the amount of salt\r\nannually dumped into the oceans and, also by chemical analysis, it is a\r\ncomparatively simple matter to figure the total amount now present in\r\nthe oceans. Some recent calculations indicate that thirty-five million\r\ntons of salt are being added each year, and this figure divided into the\r\ntotal amount for all the years places the age of the oceans at three\r\nhundred sixty millions of years.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are certain other factors which complicate the problem.\r\nFor instance, it is known that land areas exposed to surface drainage\r\nhave not always been of their present size, and the annual production of\r\nsalt by the different types of rocks exposed at various times in the\r\nhistory of the earth has not always been as it is now. The rocks also\r\nmust be older than the oceans, but how much older cannot be determined\r\nby means of figures obtained in this way.\r\n\r\nUntil the beginning of this century there was little anticipation of a\r\nbetter measuring stick than one in use at the time which placed its\r\nreliance on the total thickness of the sedimentary deposits and the\r\nlength of time required to produce this great accumulation of material\r\nwhich is known as the geological column. Since the total thickness, or\r\nheight of the column, was not accurately known, and with recognized time\r\ngaps to bridge, there was little hope of working out a complete\r\nchronology by this device, but it has supplied highly desirable and\r\nreliable information concerning parts of the record.\r\n\r\nThe system has been somewhat improved since its earliest use, and one of\r\nits latest applications gives us an age, for known sedimentary rocks, of\r\nnearly half a billion years, this being based on a total thickness of\r\none hundred miles and an average rate of 880 years for the building up\r\nof one foot of sediments. Its greatest weakness is due to the absence of\r\na reliable factor to take care of long stretches of time in which the\r\nsedimentary rocks are known to have been subjected to destructive\r\nprocesses. A yardstick of this character cannot be applied to rocks that\r\nhave been destroyed, and there are excellent reasons for believing that\r\nthese interruptions may account for several times the lapse of years\r\nindicated by the amount of rock remaining in the column which has been\r\npieced together.\r\n\r\nFollowing the discovery of radium, however, the present century provided\r\na new field of knowledge which has contributed greatly to the\r\nmeasurement of geologic time. The penetrating rays produced by radium\r\nand other radioactive substances are due to extremely slow but violent\r\ndisintegration of the material. Uranium and thorium are radioactive\r\nelements which occur in the rocks of many parts of the world. There is\r\nlittle or no loss of material as the so-called disintegration proceeds;\r\ninstead there is a complicated series of transformations in which other\r\nelements are produced, radium itself being one of these. Helium and lead\r\neventually take the place of the less stable elements and the known rate\r\nat which these products accumulate provides the highly desired key to\r\nthe age of the rocks.\r\n\r\nPart of the gas, helium, may escape, but except in rare instances where\r\nchemical alteration might occur, there probably is no loss of lead.\r\nFortunately, when this metal is produced by radioactivity it differs\r\nslightly in atomic weight from ordinary lead; otherwise the presence of\r\nthe latter would introduce a misleading factor. Since the speed at which\r\nthe change goes on cannot be increased or decreased, it is assumed that\r\nthroughout past ages it has never been faster or slower. The amount of\r\nsuch change that has been completed in any body of radioactive minerals\r\nmay be measured by techniques employed in physics and chemistry. If it\r\nis found that the amount of helium or lead present requires a hundred\r\nmillion years for its production at the working speed of the parent\r\nelements, the mineral deposit must be at least that old.\r\n\r\nCertain conditions of course complicate the problem seriously: knowing\r\nthe age of a piece of rock which happens to contain some radioactive\r\nelement is of small service in historical studies unless the rock can be\r\ndefinitely associated with a flora or fauna, or some outstanding event\r\ndisclosed by geological investigations. But there have been a few\r\ninstances in which most of the necessary conditions were present, and\r\nmore and better opportunities to apply this method will no doubt appear.\r\nOther elements, or their radioactive isotopes, are already being\r\nemployed with good results. Some of these, such as carbon 14, are more\r\nsensitive indicators for the accurate dating of events in comparatively\r\nrecent time.\r\n\r\nWhen it can be used, this type of measurement is far less subject to\r\nuncertainties than any other. It promises to eliminate all need for\r\nguessing, and comes close to a degree of accuracy which is satisfactory\r\nto the scientist, a person who thoroughly dislikes uncertainties of any\r\nkind. If suitable material can be found in just the right places it\r\nshould accomplish what the preceding method cannot do—the accurate\r\nmeasurement of the great time breaks which interrupt the geological\r\nrecord in many places. Something along this line already has been\r\naccomplished, for radioactive material has been found in some of the\r\noldest of the rocks. Regardless of the destruction going on in other\r\nlocalities, these rocks have continued to register the passing of time,\r\nand a tremendous antiquity for the earth and some of its first\r\ninhabitants has been indicated.\r\n\r\nTests made on radioactive minerals from Gilpin County, Colorado, have\r\nestablished the age of late Cretaceous or early Cenozoic rocks at sixty\r\nmillion years, providing a convenient and reasonably accurate date for\r\nthe beginning of the Age of Mammals. In Russia, one of the oldest\r\nmineral deposits yet studied in this way and regarded as early\r\nPre-Cambrian, produced the astonishing figure of 1,850,000,000 years;\r\nwhat we commonly refer to as geological history may therefore be\r\nregarded as covering a range of approximately two billions of years. The\r\nearth, in some form or other, has in all probability passed through an\r\nearlier history of another billion years or more.\r\n\r\nWherever we may roam, a portion of the prehistoric record is to be found\r\nin the rocks underfoot and not far from the surface. Formations as\r\nalready mentioned may be regarded as the pages—often torn and badly\r\nscattered—of nature’s own book, in which the geological periods are\r\nchapters. But instead of numbering these pages and chapters we have\r\n_named_ them, in order to get the parts reassembled in orderly fashion\r\nand restored to a condition which makes the book legible.

Time divisions have been proposed that are\r\nnot yet in common use while others have been abandoned or modified.\r\nSources of information are so numerous that appropriate credit cannot be\r\ngiven fairly for anything that is up-to-date. The combined chart and\r\noutline here provided is based on time calculations of recent date but\r\nwith figures slightly rounded off for the sole purpose of making them\r\neasier to remember. In view of the still existent probability of error\r\nit is felt that the slight alteration of figures may justify itself. It\r\nneed not be regarded as misleading if the present purpose be\r\nconsidered—the stimulation of a natural history interest which is not\r\nvitally concerned with the little difference between a thousand million\r\nyears and nine hundred ninety-nine million years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF THE TIME CHART\r\n\r\nThe whole of geological time has been divided and subdivided according\r\nto varying practices. The development of life is perhaps the one\r\noutstanding feature of the time divisions, but for the most part the\r\nchanges in floras and faunas have been gradual rather than abrupt, and\r\nthis makes it very difficult to draw sharp lines or to visualize\r\nbeginnings and endings of the various stages of development.\r\nOccasionally there is good excuse for drawing a line, where the record\r\nis broken and resumed again after a long lapse of time. The principal\r\ncause of such breaks is the elevation of great land masses, which brings\r\non an interval of erosion and surface destruction for the areas\r\nuplifted.\r\n\r\nThese movements of parts of the earth’s crust have been exceptionally\r\npronounced at certain times, often culminating in the production of\r\nmountain systems, and because of the extreme changes they introduce are\r\nknown as revolutions. The major divisions of prehistoric time have been\r\nestablished, at least in part, by such _revolutions_; crustal, climatic,\r\nor other _disturbances_, on a smaller scale and recurring with greater\r\nfrequency, may be regarded as establishing boundaries for the minor\r\ndivisions. Hence we have five great Eras of geological history, and\r\nthese are divided again into Periods. The time chart shows an\r\narrangement commonly used in America. In the first column the names of\r\nthe Eras are stated in technical form. Closely coinciding with these\r\nterms are the popular names of the Ages which appear in the second\r\ncolumn. These names, describing the dominant life of each age, are very\r\nconvenient. The more scientific terms used for the eras, while serving\r\nessentially the same purpose, are a little more systematic and\r\ngeneralized in that they refer to ancient life (Paleozoic), middle life\r\n(Mesozoic), and recent life (Cenozoic), without being specific as to any\r\nclass of animals or plants for any one division of time.\r\n\r\nThe period names, in the central column, have been derived from\r\nmiscellaneous sources, some of them from geographical districts, some\r\nfrom descriptive references to prominent features of the rocks, others\r\nindicating a degree of approach to recent time. In paleontology (fossil\r\nstudy) it has long been a practice to cut the periods into lower,\r\nmiddle, and upper divisions, and in a few cases it has been found\r\ndesirable to make two periods out of an old one. What was once known as\r\nthe Lower Carboniferous is now commonly recognized as the Mississippian\r\nperiod while the upper portion has become the Pennsylvanian. The Lower\r\nCretaceous is now the Comanchean of some authors.\r\n\r\nBoth old and new practices are responsible for a little confusion at the\r\npresent time. A former division into Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and\r\nQuaternary eras has been partly abandoned, but the term “Quaternary”\r\nstill applies to the Age of Man, while “Tertiary time” remains in good\r\nusage for the balance of the Cenozoic era. Among the newer introductions\r\nmay be mentioned the use of a Paleocene period which precedes the\r\nEocene. Geologists are not entirely in agreement as to the necessity for\r\nthis addition and many would not give it equivalent rank with other\r\nperiods. In the interest of simplicity these modern refinements have\r\nbeen omitted from the chart.\r\n\r\nThe figures appearing in the third column, between the Ages and Periods,\r\nindicate the millions of years that have elapsed up to present time.\r\nThey denote the age of the rocks at the beginning of each period. The\r\nage of a plant or animal which lived in Eocene time would be, according\r\nto this scale, somewhere between 35 million and 60 million years. In\r\npractice it is usually possible to determine whether a fossil was\r\nembedded in the rocks during an early or late portion of the period, and\r\nthus its age may be established within a shorter range, but it is\r\nimpossible to be exact, even in terms of millions of years, with regard\r\nto anything as far back in prehistory as the Eocene period.\r\n\r\nThe period in which we are living today is known as Recent. It began at\r\nthe close of the Ice Age or Pleistocene period about ten thousand years\r\nago and represents so little of earth history since the beginning of\r\nlife that a chart many times the length of this page would be required\r\nto show the rest of the periods in proportion. The Cambrian period is an\r\nearly chapter in which the story of prehistoric life suddenly becomes\r\nclear and richly varied. It is, however, much farther from the beginning\r\nof the record than it is from the present, and the Pre-Cambrian eras\r\nwould require a great deal more space in order to show their relative\r\nlengths. The Archeozoic and Proterozoic eras have to some extent been\r\ndivided into periods, but the great antiquity of the rocks has obscured\r\nmuch of their history, and divisions established for one locality have\r\nbeen of little service elsewhere. Consequently, the period names are in\r\nless general use and the common practice is to refer to all this great\r\nstretch of time as Pre-Cambrian.\r\n\r\nIn the last column, at the right of the chart, some of the historical\r\nfeatures are indicated. This column should be read from bottom to top in\r\norder to get the proper development of the story, and at best this\r\nsketchy outline of events can be no more than suggestive of the progress\r\nand decline through which the earth’s inhabitants have passed.\r\n\r\nRocks of every period except probably the Silurian are known to have\r\nbeen deposited somewhere in the Colorado area, although in most cases\r\nthe record for each period is far from complete. Formations are too\r\nnumerous and too varied locally to be shown on a chart of this type.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL SECTION\r\n\r\nIn the study of fossils there are two important field aids usually\r\navailable. For any locality there should be a geological map and a\r\nsection showing the sequence and character of the strata. On a\r\nsmall-scale map many of the local details have to be omitted, but the\r\nposition of the larger exposures is indicated and, with this information\r\nat hand, the fossil-bearing strata may be located with the help of a\r\ngeological section. The latter is frequently obtained from technical\r\nreports published by State and National Geological Surveys. Frequently,\r\nhowever, it is possible to obtain only a general plan for a given\r\nlocality, and a great deal of literature may have to be scanned in order\r\nto get that. Excellent geological maps of Colorado have been published\r\nby the Colorado Geological Survey and the United States Geological\r\nSurvey.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that a formation is not where we expect to find it,\r\nthis being due to several possible factors. The sediments may not have\r\nbeen deposited there, or they may have been removed by erosion. Where\r\nthe structure has been disturbed by folding and faulting, a multitude of\r\ncomplications is introduced. The expected sequence is sometimes inverted\r\nand repeated through a series of folds. Formations also may be moved\r\nmiles out of place by faulting. Both thickness and character of\r\nsediments may vary considerably within a formation. In some regions the\r\ngeology is very simple, in others extremely difficult to understand.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FORMATIONS of the DENVER-FOOTHILLS REGION\r\n    A GENERALIZED SECTION SHOWING SOME OF THE SURFACE FEATURES\r\n    RED BEDS    HOGBACKS    TABLE MOUNTAIN    DENVER DISTRICT\r\n\r\nREGION OF MOUNTAIN-MAKING UPLIFT\r\n\r\nFormations bordering the mountains have been bent into upright\r\npositions.]\r\n\r\n                PERIODS\r\n\r\n  RECENT\r\n  PLEISTOCENE\r\n  PLIOCENE\r\n  MIOCENE\r\n  OLIGOCENE\r\n  EOCENE\r\n  CRETACEOUS                                              THICKNESS\r\n  SOFT SANDSTONES GRITS & CLAYS        DENVER & ARAPAHOE   2000 ft.\r\n  SANDSTONES, SHALES & LIGNITE         LARAMIE             1000 ft.\r\n  YELLOWISH SANDS & SHALES             FOX HILLS           1000 ft.\r\n  SOFT DARK GRAY OR RUSTY SHALE        PIERRE              5000 ft.\r\n  LIMESTONES & SHALES                  NIOBRARA             500 ft.\r\n  DARK SHALES & LIME                   BENTON               400 ft.\r\n  GRAY OR BUFF SANDSTONES & CLAYS      DAKOTA               300 ft.\r\n  SHALES, SANDSTONE & LIME             MORRISON             200 ft.\r\n  JURASSIC\r\n  TRIASSIC\r\n  PERMIAN\r\n  DEEP-RED SANDY SHALES, LIME, GYPSUM  LYKINS               700 ft.\r\n  CARBONIFEROUS\r\n  MASSIVE PINK OR WHITE SANDSTONE      LYONS                200 ft.\r\n  RED OR BROWN SANDSTONE &             FOUNTAIN            1500 ft.\r\n  CONGLOMERATE\r\n  DEVONIAN\r\n  SILURIAN\r\n  ORDOVICIAN\r\n  CAMBRIAN\r\n  PRE-CAMBRIAN\r\n  METAMORPHIC & INTRUDED ROCKS         IDAHO SPRINGS\r\n  SCHIST, GNEISS, QUARTZITE            (PART)\r\n  BASEMENT ROCKS of IGNEOUS ORIGIN\r\n\r\nA generalized section for the western part of the Denver Basin is\r\nintroduced here for the use of local students. The formations normally\r\npresent in this region are shown in their usual position. They are\r\nbriefly described on the chart, and their thickness is indicated by\r\nfigures which may be regarded as near the maximum for the district. The\r\nsection will apply to most of the foothills area between Morrison and\r\nBoulder though surface features and thickness of beds will vary\r\nconsiderably from place to place.\r\n\r\nCertain of the formations are known to be fossil bearing, others barren\r\nor nearly so. When fossils are present they are usually restricted to\r\ncertain localities, and these may be widely scattered. The following\r\nremarks apply to the possibilities for finding fossils in the formations\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Denver and Arapahoe._\r\n\r\nLeaf impressions of palms, ferns, and numerous species of well-known\r\ntrees and shrubs are common in many localities. Petrified wood is fairly\r\nabundant, and a few scattered bones of reptiles and mammals have been\r\nfound. The two formations are treated as a unit because the Arapahoe is\r\nneither conspicuous nor sharply defined. Denver beds are well exposed on\r\nthe slopes of Table Mountain at Golden; fossils, however, have been\r\nobtained from several localities nearer the city of Denver, notably from\r\nthe hills just west of Overland Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Laramie._\r\n\r\nPlant material is locally abundant, principally the leaves of familiar\r\ndeciduous trees, palms, and ferns. Many of the clay pits being worked\r\nnear Golden are in this formation. Oysters and a few other mollusks may\r\nbe found in some places.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Fox Hills._\r\n\r\nBetter exposures of this formation are located to the north of Denver.\r\nMarine mollusks are most frequently found.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Pierre._\r\n\r\nIn addition to the characteristic dark shales, this formation includes\r\nsome limy material and sandstone beds, both of which are fossiliferous\r\nin places. Two types of marine mollusks are characteristic:\r\n_Inoceramus_, generic name for several species of clam-like bivalves\r\nreadily identified by concentric elevations which produce a rippled\r\neffect on the shell surfaces; and _Baculites_, cephalopods with\r\nstraight, chambered shells which often break at the suture lines, where\r\nthe fossil is weakened by the chamber walls. Small oyster shells are\r\nfairly common also. The formation is to be found some distance to the\r\neast of the prominent hogback where it weathers into smooth surfaces in\r\nthe form of broad valleys and flats, with rounded contours on the few\r\nelevations that may be present. It forms a soft, flaky soil when dry, is\r\na sticky “gumbo” when wet. The clay is generally of a rather dark\r\ngrayish color when freshly exposed but it takes on a rusty appearance\r\nafter weathering. At various levels there are numerous iron-cemented\r\nconcretions, many of which contain fossil shells.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Marine Beds of the Benton Formation, Northeastern\r\n    Colorado\r\n\r\n    A stream channel has cut deeply into the formation, uncovering and\r\n    partly destroying a plesiosaur skeleton which was found at the level\r\n    where the men are standing.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Plesiosaur Bones in Place\r\n\r\n    Benton formation. Surface rubble has been cleared away, and several\r\n    vertebrae are partially uncovered in the area at the right of the\r\n    hammer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Niobrara._\r\n\r\nThe formation contains fossils rather similar to those of the Pierre.\r\nShark’s teeth have been found in some of the lower beds. Limestone is a\r\nprominent feature, often forming a well defined ridge near the foot of\r\nthe eastern slope of the main hogback. The limestones commonly have a\r\nchalky character.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Benton._\r\n\r\nThe formation is not especially productive in this region. Marine shells\r\nare numerous in some localities, and bones of marine reptiles have been\r\nfound at various places. As usually seen, it is almost entirely composed\r\nof impure clay shales, very dark, brownish-gray to almost black, and\r\ncommonly interbedded with thin patches of white bentonite, yellow ochre,\r\ngypsum, and limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Dakota._\r\n\r\nThis formation produces the high hogback which is usually present some\r\ndistance east of the Red Rocks. There are generally two or three layers\r\nof massive, light-colored sandstone separated by clays which are used\r\nextensively in the making of bricks and pottery. Leaf impressions and\r\nsome fish scales are found in the clays and occasionally in the\r\nsandstone. The hogback is a good marker from which to locate other\r\nformations, because of its prominence in the foothills landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Morrison._\r\n\r\nGood dinosaur material has been taken from the Canon City and Morrison\r\ndistricts. The formation is to be found on the lower west slope of the\r\nDakota hogback. It consists of continental deposits of the stream and\r\nlake types. There is considerable sandstone in this formation and a\r\nlittle limestone is to be found here and there, but the most\r\ncharacteristic feature is in the shales. When freshly exposed, the\r\nshales are delicately tinted with gray, green, and maroon, a\r\nbronze-green being rather prominent. This formation is highly variable\r\nin character, with much of the clay often buried under the valley floor.\r\nIn addition to the bones of reptiles, there are plant fossils, usually\r\nof poor quality, and fresh-water gastropods more or less abundant in\r\nsome localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Lykins._\r\n\r\nOutcrops are not prominent, owing to the small amount of\r\nweather-resisting materials. The sandy clays are commonly of a deep red\r\ncolor mottled with spots of light gray. A white limestone is sometimes\r\npresent near the middle of these deposits, and gypsum beds are included\r\nlocally. The formation is often indicated only by red soil in the\r\ndepressions between ridges. Few fossils have been reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Lyons._\r\n\r\nThis formation is usually prominent as the eastern wall of the uplifted\r\nRed Rocks series. In some localities it forms a ridge of pink or white\r\nsandstone distinctly separated from the older sediments to the west.\r\nVery few fossils are found.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Fountain._\r\n\r\nExposures usually are brown to red in color, though sometimes a dirty\r\nwhite. The prominent rocks are rather coarse sandstone, commonly with a\r\ngritty texture due to the angular character of the sand or gravel from\r\nwhich they were made. These are the westernmost of the Red Beds and the\r\noldest of the uplifted sedimentary rocks bordering the foothills in most\r\nof our area. Fossils have been found in the formation, but it is\r\npractically barren for the territory here considered.\r\n\r\n                            * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThis geological section also illustrates a method of dating crustal\r\nmovements and the birth of mountain ranges, for the folding of the\r\nstrata along the flanks of the Rocky Mountains has a great deal of\r\nsignificance in this connection. The sedimentary layers were originally\r\ndeposited over much of the present mountain area in a horizontal\r\nposition, and only those formations in existence at the time could be\r\ndistorted by the upheavals which produced the new elevations. Of the\r\nseries generally involved in the movement the Laramie beds are the\r\nyoungest. Since these beds had not been formed until near the close of\r\nthe Cretaceous period it is to be assumed that the mountains must be of\r\nmore recent date, younger than the topmost of the deformed beds and at\r\nleast as old as the lowermost of the undisturbed formations overlying\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSome disturbance is evident also in the Arapahoe and Denver beds which\r\noverlie the Laramie, but this is believed to have occurred sometime\r\nafter the occasion of the first great uplift. Volcanic materials in\r\nthese beds lead to the belief that the sediments were deposited during a\r\nperiod of volcanic activity brought on by the crustal folding which\r\nterminated the Mesozoic era. Hence the conclusion arises that the age of\r\nthe Denver and Arapahoe beds must coincide closely with some of the\r\nearlier stages in the history of the mountain system. This interval is\r\noften referred to as Post-Laramie time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BEFORE THE AGE OF REPTILES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRE-CAMBRIAN COMPLEX\r\n\r\nThe rocks of Pre-Cambrian time have been buried deeply under the\r\naccumulation of younger sediments, and the resulting pressure in many\r\nplaces has been tremendous. In addition to the effects of pressure there\r\nalso is recorded in these ancient formations the repeated movements of\r\nthe materials since they were first deposited. Vertical and side\r\nadjustments of parts, with relation to other parts, have distorted the\r\noriginal arrangement of the rock particles to such an extent that\r\nordinary fossils would eventually become unrecognizable. These crushing,\r\ngrinding, and kneading forces working through millions of years alone\r\nwould account for the absence of fossils from the older deposits.\r\nFrequently the rocks have become so changed in form that their original\r\ncharacter can only be conjectured, and because of this change they are\r\nknown as metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nA few beds of Archeozoic age remain in nearly their original condition,\r\nbut they are either without fossils or they have produced very\r\nquestionable and unsatisfactory specimens. The existence of life during\r\nthese early stages of earth history is indicated largely by chemical\r\nrather than fossil evidence. Much of the ancient limestone has been\r\nconverted into marble, but it is not unreasonable to believe that plants\r\nand animals were instrumental in the production of this type of rock as\r\nthey are today. Certain varieties of iron ore deposits are now being\r\nbuilt up by the aid of plants, and similar ores in the ancient rocks may\r\nhave had a like origin. The presence of great quantities of carbon, in\r\nthe form of graphite, may be regarded also as a sign of life, for this\r\nsubstance is accumulated on a large scale by living plants, and may be\r\nretained in a solid form after the partial decay of the plant tissues.\r\n\r\nSo far as the direct evidence goes, there is no sign of any creature of\r\nlarge size or of such complicated structure as the common plants and\r\nanimals of today. The chemistry of the mineral deposits is not entirely\r\nconvincing as to the presence of life, but it is regarded as highly\r\nprobable that microscopic, single-celled plants and animals, comparable\r\nto modern algae and protozoa, were in existence during Archean time.\r\nThroughout later eras there is unmistakable evidence of gradual\r\ndevelopment from simpler to more elaborate life-forms and the Archeozoic\r\nis commonly regarded as a time of preparation during which simple\r\norganisms of some kind were becoming adapted to early conditions which\r\ncould not support life on a higher plane. The importance of the work\r\ndone by such lowly creatures in the preparation of suitable environments\r\nfor more advanced modes of living is overlooked almost entirely.\r\n\r\nDuring the next era, the Proterozoic, the record of life becomes\r\nsomewhat clearer. Fossils are hardly to be regarded as abundant but\r\nthere were several well-defined types of animals which left shells and\r\nother parts composed of mineral matter. Among these may be mentioned the\r\nRadiolaria, Foraminifera, Bryozoa, and Sponges. Radiolaria produced\r\ndelicate, often lace-like shells of many patterns adorned with the\r\nradiating filaments or spines which have suggested the name for this\r\ngroup. Foraminifera produced minute shells, sometimes many chambered,\r\nand often bearing a confusing resemblance to the work of snails. Common\r\nchalk is composed almost entirely of such shells and fragments of them.\r\n\r\nSponges and Bryozoa are animals of slightly higher organization. They\r\nare many-celled instead of one-celled and the cells have special work to\r\nperform, which is a most important step in the direction of the\r\nspecialization which characterizes the structural and life pattern of\r\nlater arrivals. The Bryozoa lived in moss-like colonies which have been\r\nimportant rock-makers; the fossil forms bear some resemblance to corals.\r\nSponges are too well known to require description although the familiar\r\narticle of commerce is merely the framework of once-living animals. They\r\nrepresent the earliest organization of true animal bodies even though in\r\nappearance they may have a resemblance to plants.\r\n\r\nActual plants of this era were of the algae class, aquatic in habit as\r\nwere their animal neighbors, the first to leave a record in the form of\r\nfossils. This record, obscure and distorted, has long been a source of\r\nperplexity to investigators. Without well-defined floras and faunas to\r\nguide them, and with rocks frequently in chaotic relationships, early\r\ngeologists were content to regard it all as a “Pre-Cambrian complex.”\r\nRecent studies have contributed a great deal of information not\r\navailable some years ago. It is quite possible that more advanced types\r\nof life were in abundance before the close of the second era, but\r\nmaterial on which to base sound opinion is still scarce.\r\n\r\nRocks of Pre-Cambrian age are plentiful in the foothills region west of\r\nDenver. The schists, gneisses, and quartzites exposed for some miles\r\nimmediately beyond the red-beds are part of this great complex. The\r\nIdaho Springs formation is known to be one of the oldest in this\r\ndistrict, although its exact age has not been determined. Other\r\nformations are recognized among the metamorphic rocks of the region but\r\nnone has contributed to our knowledge of early life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIAN LIFE\r\n\r\nThere can be no mistake as to the prolific development of life in\r\nCambrian seas, for fossils of this age are to be found in many parts of\r\nthe world, where ancient sea bottoms now form part of the land surface.\r\nInvertebrate animals appear to have made much progress, but plants were\r\neither scarce or too small and delicate to be productive of fossils. It\r\nis probable, however, that seaweeds and other algae were flourishing\r\nalong with the invertebrates, because animal life is directly or\r\nindirectly dependent on the existence of plants. The latter sustain\r\nthemselves by taking carbon and nitrogen from air, water, and soil, but\r\nanimals must obtain their requirements by eating plants or eating each\r\nother. They cannot obtain what they need from the inorganic world\r\nwithout this help from the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nOne group of animals stands out prominently above all its\r\ncontemporaries. Known as the trilobites they were by far the most\r\ndistinguished and most characteristic of Cambrian invertebrates.\r\nTrilobites inhabited the warmer seas of this period and several later\r\nones, but were extinct by the end of the Paleozoic era. Hundreds of\r\nspecies have been described, most of them under four inches in length.\r\nWell-known distant relatives now living are the shrimps, and other\r\ncrustaceans. The name Trilobite has reference to the three lobes which\r\nare apparent in the form of the upper surface, the central lobe forming\r\na broad ridge extending along the back. Beneath the outer lobes on each\r\nside there was, during life, a row of short, jointed legs used for\r\nswimming and walking, but these delicate appendages are seldom preserved\r\nin the fossils.\r\n\r\nSecond in importance among the animals of the period were the\r\nbrachiopods or lamp-shells, not true mollusks although they were\r\nprovided with similar shells composed of calcium phosphate or calcium\r\ncarbonate. Shells are of two parts (bivalved) as in the case of clams,\r\nbut the valves are above and beneath the body instead of on the right\r\nand left sides, which is the arrangement among mollusks. Although\r\nabundant as individuals, there were only a few species during the\r\nearlier part of the period; the number of species increased, however,\r\nand the race became very persistent. About seven thousand species have\r\nbeen described, and the race is not yet extinct although the number of\r\nliving species is relatively small.\r\n\r\nCambrian life evidently included representatives of all the great\r\ndivisions of invertebrates; sponges, jelly-fishes, worms, and primitive\r\ncorals have been reported. At the end of the period there was an\r\nelaborate molluscan fauna. The closing of the period in North America\r\nwas apparently a gentle elevation of continental areas and a consequent\r\nwithdrawal of the sea.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Invertebrate Fossils\r\n\r\n    Only a few prominent types have been selected from thousands of\r\n    invertebrates known to zoologists.

In these ancient\r\ndeposits the record of life continues to show new forms. Nothing of a\r\nvery spectacular sort is recorded other than a great increase in the\r\nnumber of species among types that were established in earlier periods.\r\n\r\nTrilobites were at their best, brachiopods continued to flourish, and\r\nthe mollusks made new progress, especially the cephalopods, a group\r\nwhich includes our cuttle fishes and squids. Some of these predatory\r\ncreatures attained large size and were no doubt masters of the sea.\r\nTypical forms were provided with tapering chambered shells that\r\noccasionally reached a length of twelve or more feet. Most of the shells\r\nwere straight and trumpet-like or but slightly curved. Some were closely\r\ncoiled and in this respect more like the well-known nautilus now in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe bryozoans became very common in the later part of the period and\r\ncorals made slight advances. Somewhat of a novelty at this time were the\r\ncrinoids, commonly known as “stone lilies” although not plants at all.\r\nThey have been described as starfishes with back turned downward and a\r\nthick stem attached beneath. Where they lived in great abundance the\r\nlimestone deposits may consist almost entirely of their stems. Crinoids\r\ncontinued to produce a variety of forms throughout several of the\r\nsucceeding periods.\r\n\r\nThe brachiopods were commonest of all animals representing this period,\r\nhowever, and their wide distribution, together with their known\r\npreference for warm waters, is taken to be an indication of mild\r\ntemperatures prevailing over a large portion of the earth. Land plants\r\nare indicated by spore-bearing forms related to the ferns and mosses.\r\nImpressions of such plants have been found in Europe but, since most of\r\nthe known rocks of this age were formed in seas, the marine algae are\r\nmore abundant as fossils.\r\n\r\nIn the Colorado area, rocks of Ordovician time are exposed only in\r\nmountainous areas where they have been lifted high above their original\r\nlevels. They are not especially rich in fossils although they have\r\nproduced some fish remains which are of interest in that they suggest an\r\nage of vertebrates which is just ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILURIAN EVENTS\r\n\r\nSince land floras and faunas had not yet become conspicuous the fossil\r\nrecord for this period is limited to those areas which were invaded by\r\nthe sea. Apparently there was no such invasion of the present Colorado\r\nregion, for rocks of this age are not in evidence. If they exist at all\r\nthey are restricted to localized districts which are deeply buried under\r\nsediments of later periods. There may have been no Silurian deposition\r\nin this area, or such rocks may have been produced only to be destroyed\r\nby elevation and consequent subjection to weathering and erosion during\r\na long interval of time, in which they were completely removed. In the\r\nregion of the Colorado Rockies there is no evidence of returning seas\r\nuntil late Devonian time.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the world, however, there was extensive deposition of\r\nrock-making sediments in seas which were inhabited by algae and\r\ninvertebrates of the types previously described. Among the common\r\nanimals of the time there were still numerous species of brachiopods,\r\ntrilobites, corals, crinoids, and bryozoans. In addition to the\r\nprimitive cone-shaped, cup corals there were several advanced types but\r\nthe habit of building large reefs was not yet established.\r\n\r\n“Sea scorpions,” really large crustaceans, flourished during Silurian\r\ntime, and late in the period there appeared a race of true scorpions\r\nwhich lived on dry land or between high and low tides along the\r\nseashore. These were smaller and much like modern descendants but\r\nprobably they did not wander far from the ocean shores where an\r\nabundance of food was available. These little scorpions, the largest\r\nmeasuring only two and a half inches in length, are the oldest\r\nair-breathing land animals of the fossil record.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the period was well advanced that fishes became\r\nnumerous, and much of our knowledge of the beginning of an “Age of\r\nFishes” has been obtained from European fossils. Although fishes are\r\nclassed with the vertebrate or backboned animals there are large groups\r\nwhich do not have bony skeletons but are provided instead with a simple\r\nframework of cartilage. Among the earlier and more primitive types were\r\nthe ostracoderms or bony-skinned fishes with no internal bones and only\r\na small amount of bony substance in the armor-like plates and scales\r\nwhich covered the forward portion of the body.\r\n\r\nThe ostracoderms comprise a small group of fishes about which very\r\nlittle is known. They appear to have been inhabitants of fresh-water\r\nstreams as well as lagoons bordering the seas, and may have been related\r\nto the small sharks of the time. They lived during the Ordovician,\r\nSilurian, and Devonian periods, and left no descendants now recognized\r\namong living creatures. A much larger type of armored fishes is known as\r\nthe arthrodires, a name which refers to a pointed neck and an\r\narrangement of the armor plates to permit a movement of the head. These\r\nwere the most ferocious fishes of the Silurian and Devonian seas, some\r\nof them reaching a length of twenty feet though most were much smaller.\r\nTheir jaws were provided with formidable shearing and crushing plates\r\ninstead of teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVONIAN PROGRESS\r\n\r\nThe Devonian is one of the most outstanding of all periods from the\r\nviewpoint of life development. Dominance of the fishes is its greatest\r\nachievement, the invertebrates remaining about as they were and the\r\nhigher vertebrates barely in evidence, but life on a large scale was no\r\nlonger confined to the seas. Fresh-water fishes became prominent and\r\nland plants well established. The first forests appeared, with fern-like\r\nplants predominating although woody trees of several types and\r\nconsiderable size were included. It is quite possible that extensive\r\nland areas had been well supplied with vegetation during earlier times,\r\nbut the delicate tissues of plants are far less likely to be preserved\r\nthan the limy parts of animals. The fossil record, therefore, cannot be\r\nexpected to reveal more than a suggestion of the progress made at this\r\nlevel of living. The story of plant life becomes much clearer in the\r\nnext period when conditions were more favorable for the production and\r\npreservation of plant fossils.\r\n\r\nLand animals of the time are almost unknown. A few snails and scorpions\r\nhave been found, and some footprints made by early amphibians. Insects\r\nprobably were in existence although the evidence is not quite clear on\r\nthis point. The increasing number of fresh-water fishes, however, may be\r\nregarded as a sure indication that inland conditions were becoming more\r\nfavorable for plant and animal inhabitants of all kinds.\r\n\r\nThe extent of development among the fishes cannot be accurately\r\nindicated by naming a few types, for it is mainly in the number of\r\nspecies and genera within the larger groups that progress is seen. In\r\ngeneral it may be stated that the fishes of the period had not yet\r\nacquired the bony skeleton and typical form of familiar modern species.\r\nSkeletons were of cartilage, partly hardened in some instances by lime.\r\nArmor plates were customary with certain races but were not present\r\namong all fishes. Neither were these armored forms exceptionally large,\r\nas compared with living sharks. Although occasional giants appeared, the\r\nmajority were small. Many were sluggish creatures with poorly-developed\r\njaws, living as scavengers on sea and stream bottoms. Tail fins were\r\nusually unbalanced as in the sharks, or pointed and rounded rather than\r\nevenly forked.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Modernized Types of Fishes from Eocene Shales of\r\n    Southwestern Wyoming]\r\n\r\nThe great tribe of true bony fishes, such as the cod and perch, which\r\nincludes more than ninety percent of the fishes living today, was not\r\nyet in existence. About one-third of the many kinds of fishes then\r\nliving were related to the sharks, a group which is relatively\r\ninsignificant in recent years. Nearly one-fourth of the total belonged\r\nto a tribe of enamel-scaled fishes, now represented only by a few\r\nsturgeon and gar-pike.\r\n\r\nLung fishes have never been a large group but it is noteworthy that they\r\nhave had existence since Middle Devonian time. Living members of the\r\nrace, inhabitants of Africa and South America, make a practice of\r\nburrowing into the mud of stream channels during dry seasons and are\r\nprovided with lungs which enable them to breathe air in the manner of\r\nhigher vertebrates. They survive the complete drying-up of the streams\r\nand live for months without water. Other forms, with less development of\r\nlungs, frequent stagnant pools and come to the surface occasionally for\r\na breath of air. All are provided with gills also, which enables them to\r\nobtain their oxygen as other fishes do. They are believed to be a\r\nconnecting link between the fishes and the early amphibians. More\r\naccurately, perhaps, they should be regarded as holding an intermediate\r\nposition without being directly ancestral to any higher type of\r\nvertebrate animal.\r\n\r\nStill dominant among the invertebrates were the brachiopods, on the\r\nwhole averaging a little larger in size, and otherwise indicating\r\ncongenial times for that type of organism. They reached the peak of\r\ntheir development during this period. Trilobites were declining although\r\na few new and strangely ornamented varieties made a brief appearance.\r\nCrinoids apparently found living conditions less favorable during\r\nDevonian time, but in a later era they again became prominent. Corals\r\nwere favored only at times and in certain localities. Along with the\r\ncrinoids they appear to have suffered from the presence of an unusual\r\namount of mud in the waters of their customary habitats. Both had a\r\npreference for clear water as indicated by the absence of fossils from\r\nlimestones containing more than a very small percentage of muddy\r\nsediments. Crustaceans, similar to the sea-scorpions and better known as\r\neurypterids, became prominent among fresh-water animals. Some were\r\nunusually large for creatures of this class, lengths of several feet\r\nbeing recorded from fragments. Gastropod mollusks came into prominence\r\nin localities where living conditions were favorable. Bivalves continued\r\nto thrive but the cephalopods had a rather meager development\r\nconsidering the heights they were to achieve in subsequent periods.\r\n\r\nIn western North America the large expanse of territory known as the\r\nGreat Plains was evidently well above sea level during this entire\r\nperiod, for no beds of this age are found in eastern Colorado. West of\r\nthe Front Range, however, there was some deposition of marine sediments\r\nduring late Devonian time. Formations of this age are exposed near\r\nSalida and Glenwood Springs, on the White River Plateau, and in the San\r\nJuan region.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous period gets its name from the vast deposits of coal\r\nwhich were developed during that time in many parts of the northern\r\nhemisphere. Depressed land surfaces bordering the continents, and\r\nextending well into the interior of present boundaries, supported dense\r\ngrowths of vegetation and provided the swampy conditions most favorable\r\nto coal production. Varieties of plants which are now of small size and\r\nlowly position in the botanical world acquired the proportions of large\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIFEROUS FORESTS\r\n\r\nBest-known fossils of the period are carbonized portions of the larger\r\ntrees, and impressions left in the muds and sands of ancient bogs.\r\nForest trees of several kinds reached the height of a hundred feet, with\r\na trunk diameter of two to six feet. This size often is exceeded in\r\nmodern forests, but by trees of an entirely different type. Considering\r\nthe amount of development among the plants of earlier periods,\r\nCarboniferous forests provide an outstanding spectacle of advancing\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nQuite common among the larger trees were two varieties of club-mosses,\r\nalso known as scale trees. They were cone-bearing evergreens with only\r\nslight resemblance to modern conifers. Instead of seeds they produced\r\nspores, a method of reproduction which is practiced among ferns. The\r\ntrunks were marked from bottom to top with uniform patterns of cushions\r\nand scars indicating the points at which leaves were attached during the\r\nearlier stages of growth. In the Lepidodendrons the rows of scale-like\r\ncushions wind spirally upward while among the Sigillaria there is a\r\nvertical arrangement of leaf-scars which resemble the imprints of a\r\nseal, these impressions being in straight and parallel rows on a surface\r\nwhich may be either ribbed or smooth. The leaves of scale trees were\r\nstiff and slender, and arranged in grass-like tufts at the top.\r\n\r\nCalamites, related to our horsetail rushes, were somewhat smaller than\r\nthe scale trees. Their trunks consisted of a thin, woody cylinder with a\r\npithy interior, and were marked at intervals by nodes which gave them\r\nthe “jointed” appearance of a bamboo stem. Leaves were arranged in\r\ncircles around the nodes of main stem or branches. Spore-bearing cones\r\nappeared at the tips of the stems.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Prehistoric Plants\r\n\r\n    Some of the larger and better known plants of past ages are shown as\r\n    reconstructed by artists. Finer details of the reconstructions often\r\n    have to be neglected because of uncertainties due to the scattered\r\n    and fragmentary character of the fossil record.]\r\n\r\n  LEAF IMPRESSIONS\r\n    Carboniferous Ferns\r\n    Strap-leaf Conifer (Cordaites)\r\n  MODERNIZED TYPES\r\n    Sequoia Cone and foliage\r\n    Miocene Fossils (Florissant Shales)\r\n      Maple\r\n      Willow\r\n    Eocene palm (Denver Beds)\r\n  HORSE TAIL RUSHES\r\n    Restoration (Calamites)\r\n    Fossils Leaves and Stem\r\n  CYCADS\r\n    Restoration\r\n    Fossil Trunk\r\n  CLUB MOSSES\r\n    Restoration (Sigillaria)\r\n    Fossils Trunk Impressions\r\n  SCALE TREES\r\n    Restoration (Lepidodendron)\r\n    Fossil Leaf scars\r\n\r\nAlso included among the larger trees were the Cordaites or large-leaved\r\nevergreens, tall and slender, seed-bearing but not true conifers as yet.\r\nLeaves were strap-shaped or grass-like, the larger ones having a length\r\nof six feet and a width of six inches. Trunks were woody, resembling\r\npine, but with a central pith. The flowers were small and resembled\r\ncatkins in form.\r\n\r\nFerns and fernlike plants were so numerous that the period has been\r\nknown as an age of ferns. Earlier knowledge of these forests was based\r\non fossils of a fragmentary character from which an accurate association\r\nof parts could rarely be obtained. A general relationship with the ferns\r\nwas apparent, but careful study of additional material has given us a\r\nrather different view of Carboniferous plant life and we note a highly\r\ndiversified array of forms with many suggestions of modern tendencies.\r\nThe flora as a whole may be regarded as highly specialized for the\r\nconditions which prevailed at the time and were not to continue through\r\nsubsequent periods. Warm temperatures and abundant moisture were\r\nessential especially to spore-bearing types, and the cold, arid\r\nconditions of the next period put an end to many of the groups, or\r\ngreatly reduced their prominence.\r\n\r\nThis could be regarded equally well as an age of insects, for some of\r\nthese invertebrates acquired the greatest size they have ever had,\r\nparticularly the dragonflies with a wing-spread of more than two feet in\r\none of the largest fossils so far discovered. Cockroaches numbering\r\nupwards of five hundred species have been named. Though large they are\r\nhardly to be regarded as giants, lengths of three or four inches being\r\nabout the limit.\r\n\r\nSome of the insect types of today quite evidently existed among the\r\ninhabitants of Carboniferous forests, but it is apparent that there were\r\nalso some antiquated forms which may have descended from the trilobites.\r\nAlthough some authorities regard this as the period in which insects\r\noriginated, there are others who maintain that definite beginnings are\r\nnot established so readily on present evidence. Spiders are believed to\r\nhave made their appearance at this time.\r\n\r\nFour-footed vertebrates resembling salamanders were prominent animals of\r\nthe Carboniferous swamps. At first adapted to a life in water and later\r\nto land conditions, they are known as amphibians, the name being based\r\non the ability to live in two different kinds of environment. Common\r\nliving representatives of this group are the toads and frogs, but these\r\ntailless forms are not known among fossils of the Paleozoic era and are\r\nalmost unknown throughout the Mesozoic. The Age of Amphibians, as we\r\napply that phrase, was definitely not an age of toads and frogs.\r\n\r\nThese primitive land animals were of different types, ranging from much\r\nsmaller sizes up to the length of a crocodile. Most of them had short\r\nlegs, and feet which were suitable for locomotion upon land, but many of\r\nthe creatures probably spent most of their lives in the water. Tails\r\nwere usually high and flattened as if for swimming, sometimes long, at\r\nother times greatly shortened in proportion to the body. Heads were\r\ngenerally large, jaws long, and mouths wide.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the period true reptiles appear, but this race of\r\nanimals is destined to make a more spectacular advance than the\r\namphibians and will be discussed in connection with Mesozoic life. The\r\namphibians, however, are regarded as being the ancestors of the reptiles\r\nas well as the higher quadrupeds which follow them. Although living\r\nreptiles are readily distinguished from living amphibians there is a\r\ndifferent situation with regard to these primitive forms, for among the\r\nfossils it becomes increasingly difficult to separate the two groups as\r\nnew material is investigated.\r\n\r\nInvertebrates had their ups and downs during the period. Trilobites\r\nbecame scarce, and brachiopods for a time were the most abundant of the\r\nshelled animals but later declined rapidly. In favorable localities the\r\ncrinoids established a wonderful record for new species before the\r\nperiod had advanced very far. Hundreds of species of Carboniferous\r\ninvertebrates are known, and in many of the rocks of the period they are\r\nthe only fossils to be found, for the vertebrates were still unable to\r\nventure far from the swampy districts, and much inland territory was too\r\nwell drained to support either the floras or faunas then existing.\r\n\r\nIn the Colorado area there are both marine and continental formations\r\nbut the great coal-making forests and their inhabitants were limited to\r\nother localities. As a consequence this region is not famous for\r\nCarboniferous fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERMIAN HARDSHIPS\r\n\r\nFor a time there was no great change in North America following the\r\nopening of the Permian. Then began a series of mountain-making movements\r\nand continental uplifts which drained the swamps, lakes, and inland\r\nseas. With the passing of the vegetation which had established itself in\r\nand around these areas much of the animal life followed. It is probable\r\nthat a considerable proportion of the marine life survived, much more\r\nthan is indicated by the fossil record, but the receding seas carried\r\nthe survivors into territory which is now inaccessible to fossil\r\nhunters.\r\n\r\nAfter Middle Permian time the climate everywhere seems to have been cold\r\nand dry. By the end of the period there had been accomplished more\r\ngeographical change throughout the world than at any time since the\r\nbeginning of the Paleozoic era. Traces of the crustal movements which\r\nproduced new mountain ranges can be followed in Europe, Asia, and North\r\nAmerica. The Appalachian region was raised to a great height, possibly\r\nin excess of three miles. A major disturbance of this character is known\r\namong geologists as a revolution, and to this particular one the name\r\n“Appalachian Revolution” has been given.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of continents necessarily changes their coast lines. This,\r\nin turn, influences ocean currents which have an important bearing on\r\nclimatic conditions. In addition to this, the elevation of mountain\r\nsystems not only rearranges the distribution of hot and cold winds over\r\nthe land areas but it may produce barriers to the migrations of floras\r\nand faunas, confining them to areas in which it is no longer possible to\r\nlive. When the effect upon plants and animals is considered, it is\r\neasier to understand why a line is drawn across the geological time\r\nchart at such a point and an era of prehistory is regarded as closed.\r\n\r\nDuring the Permian period there was recorded in the rocks more\r\nwidespread glacial action than ever before or since. With less inland\r\nwater to provide the necessary evaporation there was a marked decrease\r\nin rainfall, and arid or semi-arid conditions replaced the hospitable\r\nclimate that had been such an important factor in the prolific life of\r\nthe Carboniferous. The struggle for existence became intense, but\r\nhardier types of plants and animals, with greater ability to adapt\r\nthemselves to adverse conditions, established themselves here and there,\r\nas ancestral forms became extinct. Most of the large spore-bearing trees\r\ndied out and seed-producing varieties began to acquire prominence, among\r\nthem the coniferous evergreens. Ferns, however, proved their\r\nadaptability by producing some new forms which became prominent in\r\nPermian floras.\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric amphibians have been divided into three orders, one of\r\nwhich includes all the larger forms. This group, known as the\r\nlabyrinthodonts, continued on through Permian time but began to show\r\nbackward tendencies, with dwindling limbs and a return to life in the\r\nwater. Among the larger land varieties are typical fossils ranging from\r\nabout fifteen inches to five feet in length. In outward appearance they\r\ndiffered from Carboniferous amphibians. One of the other orders,\r\nincluding a great diversity of smaller forms, became extinct during this\r\nperiod, leaving no known descendants. The third order is regarded as the\r\noldest, and probably the ancestral group from which the modern newts and\r\nsalamanders originated.\r\n\r\nThe most successful of Permian land animals were the peculiar reptiles\r\nthat learned to live in drier regions. Like the horned toad and Gila\r\nmonster of our arid southwestern United States, the larger Permian\r\nreptiles were four-footed animals. In size and shape they were not\r\ngreatly different from amphibians then living. An exception to this\r\nrule, among some of them, is the development of long, bony spines above\r\nthe vertebrae of the back. A fairly common fossil of this type, found in\r\nTexas and known as _Dimetrodon_, had a total length of six feet, about\r\nhalf of this being in the tail. The tips of the spines adorning the back\r\nreached a height of three feet or more and there was probably a covering\r\nof skin over these bones, which would produce a sail-like structure or\r\n“fin” of large size. Its use has not been explained but it provides an\r\neasy name for these odd creatures—the “fin-back lizards.”\r\n\r\nRock deposits produced in arid regions usually have characters which are\r\nnot difficult to recognize. Gritty texture, irregular bedding, red\r\ncolor, and gypsum are common features. Formations of Permian age are to\r\nbe found in Colorado but better fossil deposits have been discovered in\r\nKansas and Texas.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Marine Reptiles: Plesiosaur (Lower Skeleton) and\r\n    Mosasaur\r\n\r\n    The Mesozoic Era produced many types of reptiles besides the\r\n    dinosaurs. Two of the marine forms are shown in this illustration,\r\n    both from Cretaceous beds of the western United States.  Plesiosaurs\r\n    were the giants of the seas in their time, lengths of forty to fifty\r\n    feet being not uncommon. A long flat tail provided locomotion for\r\n    the mosasaurs whereas the plesiosaurs resorted to the peculiar limb\r\n    structures known as flippers or paddles.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE AGE OF REPTILES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic, or era of middle life, was a long stretch of time during\r\nwhich there was marvelous development among the reptiles. Many strange\r\ntypes were produced and most of them became extinct before the end of\r\nthe era. The reptilian stock branched out in many directions. Types\r\nemerged which differed from one another so widely that their mutual\r\nrelationships have become obscure. Hideous and fantastic creatures\r\nsuggesting sea serpents and dragons were worldwide in distribution.\r\nReptiles of the air and seas acquired large size and weird forms, but\r\ngreater advances were made upon land.\r\n\r\nThe flying reptiles or pterosaurs flourished in Jurassic times with some\r\nof the larger varieties surviving until near the close of the\r\nCretaceous. Although these winged lizards were the first of the\r\nvertebrates to fly they are not to be confused with birds. They were\r\nwithout feathers, and the earlier forms were provided with long tails\r\nbearing a flattened rudder-like tip. One of the best known of this type\r\nhad a length of about eighteen inches. Its jaws were long and provided\r\nwith sharp teeth. The wings were membranes attached to body and legs,\r\nstretched and manipulated by means of greatly elongated fingers. In\r\nlater types there was a reduction in tooth equipment and length of tail.\r\n_Pteranodon_, found in Kansas, had a wing spread of twenty-five feet, a\r\nlarge toothless beak, a short body, and a mere stub of a tail. It was\r\none of the last of these winged monsters.\r\n\r\nSeveral types of marine reptiles appeared during this era, among them\r\nthe plesiosaurs which first appeared in Triassic seas. These peculiar\r\nanimals were serpent-like with regard to the character of head, neck,\r\nand tail, but in other respects were quite different, the short\r\nbarrel-shaped body being provided with four large paddles corresponding\r\nto the usual limbs of quadrupeds. Fossil remains of these animals are\r\ncommon in many Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits, some of the largest\r\nexceeding forty feet in length. Mosasaurs, also marine carnivores,\r\ninhabited shallow Cretaceous seas throughout the world and are\r\nespecially abundant as fossils in the Kansas chalk beds. These were\r\nelongated forms with a resemblance to salamanders in some respects but\r\nprovided with long pointed jaws and sharp teeth. Swimming was\r\naccomplished largely by the tail though probably aided to some extent by\r\nfour webbed paddles or flippers. The ichthyosaurs were more fish-like in\r\nconstruction, as the name implies. The limbs were short and broad, and\r\nthere was usually present a well-developed tail-fin as well as a large\r\nfin on the back. They were especially abundant in Jurassic time. Fossils\r\nare fairly common in marine deposits of western North America. Mosasaurs\r\nand ichthyosaurs were about half as long as the plesiosaurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDINOSAURS\r\n\r\nMost spectacular of the prehistoric reptiles were the dinosaurs, a large\r\ngroup of animals varying greatly as to size, form, and habits. They were\r\nadapted for a life on land though many of them probably spent much of\r\ntheir time partly submerged in the waters of lakes and streams. There is\r\nlittle that can be said of the group as a whole other than that all of\r\nthem were reptiles. Further than that it is necessary to regard them as\r\nbelonging to several different subdivisions of the Reptilia.\r\nClassification has been difficult and the names used for the various\r\nsubdivisions are often misleading to the layman who tries to understand\r\nthe terminology.\r\n\r\nAncestral reptiles were five-toed and five-fingered but among the\r\ndinosaurs there were many departures from the standard formula. Three or\r\nfour of the digits were commonly well developed, the others when present\r\nbeing shortened or reduced to mere rudiments. Early in the history of\r\ndinosaurs there was a division of the stock into two main branches, each\r\nof which includes a variety of types and sizes, and is again subdivided.\r\nThe two main groups are best recognized by the construction of the bony\r\nframework which comprises the pelvic girdle or hip region of the\r\nskeleton. In order to avoid technical difficulties, however, the\r\nremaining discussion of these interesting reptiles will be confined to a\r\nfew names and descriptions which serve to illustrate roughly the great\r\namount of variation that developed from the comparatively simple\r\nancestral pattern. The plan according to which the dinosaurs are usually\r\nclassified is barely suggested by the types described.\r\n\r\nThe meat-eaters were active creatures provided with powerful jaws and\r\nteeth. They were unarmored, moved about on their hind feet, and during\r\ntheir time were the most highly advanced of all animals. _Tyrannosaurus_\r\nwith a length of forty-five feet or more, and _Deinodon_, nearly as\r\nlarge, were among the greatest of these. Both lived in the Cretaceous\r\nperiod. Their teeth were simple but strong, knife-like, curved, and\r\nfinely serrated. Skulls were large and the forelimbs were reduced almost\r\nto a state of uselessness. Large carnivores lived also during Jurassic\r\ntime and even as far back as late Triassic. Early Triassic forms were of\r\nsmaller size.\r\n\r\nMore primitive flesh-eating dinosaurs of the Triassic and Jurassic\r\nperiods were delicately proportioned and lightly built bipeds bearing\r\nsome resemblance to birds. _Struthiomimus_, which means\r\nostrich-resembling, was about the size of the bird which provides the\r\nname. It was slender in the limbs, three-toed, long necked, long tailed.\r\nThe skull was small, forelegs long for a biped. Unlike most dinosaurs it\r\nwas toothless. All these bird-like carnivores were small as compared\r\nwith other contemporary forms. Compsognathus, of Germany, and one of the\r\nsmallest of all dinosaurs, had a length of less than three feet,\r\nincluding the long tail.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: One of the Large Jurassic Dinosaurs (_Diplodocus\r\n    longus_)\r\n\r\n    This magnificent specimen, exhibited by the Denver Museum of Natural\r\n    History, has a length of seventy-five feet six inches. Two years\r\n    were required to complete the task of removing the bones from the\r\n    matrix rock and preparing them for mounting. Diplodocus was one of\r\n    many large reptiles which inhabited western North America a hundred\r\n    and fifty million years ago. The skeleton was obtained from the\r\n    Morrison beds of eastern Utah. The same formation is exposed in many\r\n    Colorado localities, including the foothills west of Denver, where\r\n    it acquired its name from the town of Morrison.]\r\n\r\nIn Jurassic time there became prominent a group of large dinosaurs which\r\nwere more equally developed as to fore and hind limbs. They were\r\nsluggish creatures, quadrupedal in their manner of locomotion,\r\nvegetarians in regard to their diet. Some of them reached enormous\r\nproportions and it is believed that they resorted to life in the water\r\nin order to get part of the weight off their feet. _Diplodocus_ and\r\n_Brontosaurus_ are the names of well-known giants in this group. They\r\nhad long necks and tails, very small skulls, were the largest of all\r\nland animals and are known to have reached a length of eighty feet or\r\nmore. Some estimates, based on measurements of incomplete skeletons,\r\nhave exceeded one hundred feet, but these extremes are somewhat\r\nquestionable. _Diplodocus_ was the more elongated of the two, with much\r\nof its length in the whip-like tail. Our mounted skeleton has a length\r\nof seventy-five feet six inches, measured along the vertebrae. Its\r\nheight at the pelvis is twelve feet six inches.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of these large quadrupeds are of a slightly broadened and\r\nblunted form which has caused some speculation as to their possible use.\r\nIt has even been suggested that the animals were fish-eaters but this\r\nseems impossible in view of the great size and general characteristics\r\nof the group. Although they differ extremely in some respects, they are\r\nregarded as being more closely related to the carnivores than to the\r\nherbivores of the second great branch of the tribe.\r\n\r\nThe unquestioned herbivores, constituting this second branch of the\r\ndinosaurian race, also include both bipeds and quadrupeds. The better\r\nknown plant-eaters were large animals but not such monsters as\r\n_Tyrannosaurus_ or _Brontosaurus_. Of the bipeds, _Trachodon_ is perhaps\r\nbest known. It is one of the duck-billed dinosaurs which had an average\r\nlength of about thirty feet. The duckbills were unarmored, active\r\nanimals, good swimmers as well as runners. They were prominent and\r\nwidely distributed during late Cretaceous time. Many skeletons have been\r\nfound in western North America. Natural casts and impressions of\r\nmummified remains indicate that the hides were scaly and the feet\r\nprovided with webs between the toes. The bill was broad, flat, and\r\ntoothless, but the sides of the mouth were provided with a large number\r\nof simple teeth closely arranged in parallel rows. The fine skeleton\r\nexhibited in our hall is thirty feet six inches in length. Near\r\nrelatives of _Trachodon_, such as _Corythosaurus_ had hollow, bony\r\ncrests, combs, or tubular structures on top of the head. These may have\r\nbeen of some service in connection with breathing while feeding under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A Duck-billed Dinosaur of the Cretaceous Period\r\n    (_Trachodon mirabilis_)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Stegosaur (_Stegosaurus stenops_)]\r\n\r\nAmong the quadrupedal vegetarians an interesting family is represented\r\nby _Stegosaurus_, a late Jurassic dinosaur having a length of about\r\ntwenty feet. These creatures had heavy limbs, all used in walking, an\r\narched back, and almost no brain at all. A double row of large flattened\r\nplates standing upright and extending from the rear of the skull nearly\r\nto the tip of the tail provided some protection for the back of the\r\nanimal, but otherwise there was no defensive armor. Several long spikes\r\nat the end of the tail probably served as weapons. The mounted skeleton\r\nin our collection was obtained from Garden Park, near Canon City,\r\nColorado, a district which has long been famous for dinosaur remains.\r\n\r\nThe ankylosaurs were more completely armored with closely set bony\r\nplates fitting neatly over the body. They were of about the same size as\r\nthe stegosaurs but the body was broad and somewhat flattened. These\r\narmored quadrupeds apparently lived only during the Cretaceous period,\r\nafter the disappearance of the stegosaurs. Their tooth equipment was\r\nvery poor and in a few cases entirely lacking. _Ankylosaurus_ and\r\n_Nodosaurus_ are good examples of the type. They have been described as\r\nanimated tanks and are sometimes referred to as having the appearance of\r\nenormous horned toads.\r\n\r\nAmong the last of the dinosaurs to come and go were the horned\r\nquadrupeds known as the Ceratopsia. Their entire history appears to have\r\nbeen confined to the Upper Cretaceous and the closing stages of the\r\nreptilian era in America. _Triceratops_ and _Monoclonius_ are well-known\r\nrepresentatives of the group. Besides the horns, which appeared above\r\nthe eyes or near the center of the nose, there was a broad, flattened,\r\nbackward extension of some of the skull bones which produced a great\r\nfrill or collar reaching over the neck as far back as the shoulders.\r\nThis frill, combined with the large skull, gave the animal the\r\nappearance of being nearly one-third head. _Triceratops_ had three\r\nhorns, _Monoclonius_ only one. The average length of the animals was\r\nslightly under twenty feet.\r\n\r\nAlthough very little is known about the ancestry of the horned dinosaurs\r\na valuable discovery in Mongolia may throw some light on the subject. A\r\nsmall dinosaur with a well-developed frill, but no horns, once inhabited\r\nthe region of the present Gobi desert, and in recognition of the\r\napparent relationship it has been named _Protoceratops_. In addition to\r\nnumerous skeletons, several nests of eggs were found in association with\r\nthe bones. Until this discovery was made, dinosaur eggs had been\r\npractically unknown. A reproduction of one of these nests is among our\r\nexhibits.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A Sea Turtle of Cretaceous Time (_Protostega gigas_)\r\n\r\n    This marine animal belongs to a group which became extinct near the\r\n    close of the great reptilian era, but a few related forms still\r\n    survive. Their weight is greatly reduced by the peculiar\r\n    construction of the shell, and the front feet are enlarged for use\r\n    as oars, an excellent illustration of the manner in which a land\r\n    type can become adapted to life in the sea.]\r\n\r\nWith the possible exception of a very few short-lived survivals\r\ndinosaurs were extinct before the opening of the Age of Mammals, many of\r\nthem for millions of years. Along with them went other types of ancient\r\nreptiles, and the cause of their extinction is a problem which may never\r\nbe solved. Conditions remained favorable for the turtles, which made\r\ntheir first appearance during Triassic time, and for the crocodiles,\r\nwhich date back to the Jurassic period. Snakes were only at the\r\nbeginning of their history as the era closed. The survival of these\r\nmodern forms suggests that they were favored to a greater extent than\r\nthe dinosaurs during a prolonged period of changing conditions the full\r\ndetails of which are unknown to us.\r\n\r\nIn general it is to be expected that disaster would first overcome the\r\nhighly specialized creatures, such as the dinosaurs, which had become\r\nmore delicately adjusted to the particular environments in which they\r\nlived. It appears that some of them had been too progressive up to a\r\ncertain point, but not sufficiently adaptable to get beyond that stage,\r\nor fortunate enough to make their advances in directions that could be\r\nfollowed, through fluctuations in the matter of food supply, predatory\r\nenemies, climate, and other factors which bear upon success and failure.\r\n\r\nThe reptilian era closed with exceptional volcanic activities in many\r\nparts of the world, but these cannot account for the disappearance of\r\nthe highly diversified and abundant reptilian life. The eruptions were\r\nmerely incidental to movements and readjustments in large masses of rock\r\ncomprising the earth’s crust or surface. Such crustal folding and\r\nelevations always have been of serious consequences to both plants and\r\nanimals because of their effect upon drainage and climate. There were\r\ndisturbances of this kind in western North America in late Jurassic\r\ntime, with folding and uplift in the region of the Sierras and probably\r\nextending from Mexico to southern Alaska. A great trough to the east of\r\nthis elevated district was produced in the course of these movements and\r\nprovided access to the sea from south to north. During the Cretaceous\r\nperiod there were repeated invasions and retreats of the sea by way of\r\nthis great depression, consequent upon slight changes in the elevation\r\nof the floor. Hence there are numerous marine formations in Colorado and\r\nadjoining states, some of them rich in fossils.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the Cretaceous period the sea had made its final\r\ndeparture from this region, and the Mesozoic era was terminated by\r\nrevolutionary disturbances which brought about the uplifting of a new\r\nmountain system. The Rocky Mountains may be regarded as part of this\r\nsystem and to have had their birth at this time. The Rockies, however,\r\nshow unmistakable signs of repeated elevation, with intervals of erosion\r\nduring which there was great reduction of their total height. What we\r\nsee of them today is the result of more than fifty million years of\r\ncontinuous geological activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT LIFE AND CLIMATE\r\n\r\nSome idea of the Mesozoic climate is obtained from the character and\r\ndistribution of the plant life. Triassic floras are not large and there\r\nis very little fossil evidence for the earlier half of the period. It is\r\nquite possible that arid or desert conditions prevailed for a time in\r\nmuch of North America, as at the close of the Paleozoic era. Plant life\r\nwas at first not abundant, and conditions were unfavorable for the\r\nproduction of fossils. In Upper Triassic rocks of Virginia, however,\r\nthere are signs of swampy conditions, with rushes and ferns\r\npredominating. Adjoining forest areas were well timbered with large\r\nconiferous evergreens which show no annual growth rings, as similar\r\ntrees do in regions where cold winters alternate with warm summers. This\r\nsuggests, for that time and place at least, a uniformly warm climate,\r\nlacking seasonal variations. Warm temperature or subtropical climates\r\nare indicated again by some of the Jurassic and Cretaceous plants, but\r\nintervals of lower temperatures and variable climates are also apparent.\r\nPalms, figs, and other trees, very similar to modern types now living\r\nonly in warmer regions, were widely distributed in late Cretaceous time,\r\nand their range was extended into regions which have since become too\r\ncold to support such growths.\r\n\r\nThe trend toward modern forms in the plant world was gradual, but\r\nthroughout the era there were occasional novelties that attract the\r\nattention of botanists. Ferns and horsetail rushes, reminiscent of the\r\nPaleozoic forests, soon began to lose their prominence as the\r\nseed-bearing trees gained the ascendency. Mesozoic time could well be\r\ncalled the age of cycads, because of the striking performance of this\r\nplant group. Different varieties flourished in the three periods, with\r\nthe Jurassic standing out as the time of greatest abundance.\r\n\r\nTo the uninitiated, the usual cycad fossils resemble “petrified\r\npineapples,” but these are merely the scarred stems or trunks of small\r\nto medium-sized trees with a tufted arrangement of leaves at the top,\r\nand usually without branches. Foliage and habit of growth suggest\r\nsomething more like large ferns or low-growing palms, with short, thick\r\ntrunks seldom more than fifteen feet tall and many of them under three\r\nfeet. The leaves are rarely found entire or attached to the trunks, but\r\noccasional discoveries indicate a leaf-length of about ten feet.\r\nAlthough they are classed among the first and lowest of seed-bearing\r\nplants, and in this respect are related to the conifers, their\r\nappearance was quite unlike that of the modern cone-bearing evergreens.\r\n\r\nMore nearly resembling the common conifers of today were the sequoias,\r\nof early Mesozoic origin and far more abundant during Cretaceous time\r\nthan they are at present. The maidenhair trees, now represented by a\r\nsingle species of _Ginkgo_ which is cultivated principally in China and\r\nJapan, were never very prominent but are of interest as an ancient\r\nfamily that persisted throughout the Mesozoic and down to our own time.\r\nBefore the close of the Cretaceous period the flowering plants had\r\ngreatly outnumbered the spore-bearing groups, such as the ferns and\r\nhorsetails which were formerly so abundant. We know little of early\r\nflowers, however, except in connection with trees, the large gayly\r\ncolored blossoms of the type now conspicuous in woodlands, meadows, and\r\ngardens being later arrivals and poor subjects for preservation as\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\nCretaceous floras were surprisingly modern in character, far in advance\r\nof the animal life. Poplars, plane trees, magnolias, palms, figs, oaks,\r\nand buckthorns were abundant at the close of the Cretaceous, as\r\nindicated by fossils of the Laramie formation, which is the surface rock\r\nin many localities near Denver. Also abundant in various places at this\r\ntime were walnut, hazelnut, laurel, tulip, maple, beech, birch,\r\nbreadfruit, ivy, holly, and many other well-known trees and shrubs.\r\nSedges and grasses, which became so important to the herbivorous mammals\r\nof the next era, made their first appearance in Cretaceous time but were\r\nthen inconspicuous.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL AND FOSSIL FOOTPRINTS\r\n\r\nThe abundance of plant life in the Colorado area during the Cretaceous\r\nperiod is indicated by the extent of coal deposits of this age. About\r\none-fourth the area of the state is underlain by coal seams varying in\r\nthickness from a few inches to fifty feet or more, most of it being\r\nCretaceous. In the northern Colorado district the coal-bearing formation\r\nis the Laramie. Near Denver there is some coal in the Arapahoe formation\r\nwhich overlies the Laramie and is of later age.\r\n\r\nCoal mines often produce excellent plant fossils, and occasionally other\r\nevidence of prehistoric life. In a mine near Canon City, Colorado, a\r\nseries of natural casts of dinosaur feet was taken from the overlying\r\nrock after the coal had been removed. One of these, in the Denver Museum\r\nof Natural History, is seen to consist of sandstone inside a very thin\r\nlayer of dark clay. Flattened against the lower surface is the\r\ncarbonized stem of a Cretaceous plant which grew in the swamp where the\r\ncoal deposit was formed.\r\n\r\nSince the shape of dinosaur feet is unmistakable we can only assume that\r\na large reptile of this type walked over the surface of swampy ground in\r\nwhich a great thickness of decaying vegetation had accumulated. A layer\r\nof mud settled over the top and became sufficiently firm to retain the\r\nmold of the feet as the animal moved along. Any plant material either on\r\nthe mud or included in it was pushed to the bottom of the impressions\r\nand flattened out by the weight of the huge creature. Then sand was\r\nwashed into the footprints from some nearby source during a heavy\r\nrainstorm.\r\n\r\nFollowing these events there was probably a subsidence of the area, and\r\na great thickness of rock-making sediments was built over the ancient\r\nswamp. The buried vegetation gradually became converted into coal, the\r\nsand consolidated into a firm sandstone, and the mud produced the shales\r\nforming the roof of the present mine, which is now at an elevation of a\r\nmile above sea level as a consequence of the general uplifting of the\r\nRocky Mountain region during late Cretaceous and subsequent time.\r\n\r\nWhen the coal was removed, the hard sandstone casts separated readily\r\nfrom the softer shales surrounding them. A small amount of the shale\r\nadheres to the sandstone, and some of the flattened vegetation, now in\r\nthe condition of coal, still remains attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESOZOIC INVERTEBRATES\r\n\r\nAs in other eras, the invertebrates fluctuate with the periods.\r\nCharacteristic forms appear, become more or less prominent, then in many\r\ncases decline or disappear. Variations among the mollusks are\r\nparticularly helpful in the identification of rocks which originated in\r\nthe Cretaceous seas. Clam-like bivalves of the genus _Inoceramus_, the\r\nstraight-shelled ammonids known as _Baculites_, and oysters, are locally\r\ncommon in some of the formations exposed a few miles west of Denver.\r\n\r\nThe ammonids, or “ammonites,” were extremely abundant throughout the\r\nworld during Mesozoic time. Their shells were chambered like those of\r\nthe pearly nautilus, a related cephalopod mollusk inhabiting tropical\r\nseas at the present time. While only four species of the Nautilus tribe\r\nare living today, thousands of species of ammonids swarmed the\r\nprehistoric seas. Many new forms came into existence in Triassic time\r\nbut few survived the period. A pronounced revival occurred in the\r\nJurassic, only to be followed by a decline and eventual extinction at\r\nthe close of the Cretaceous. Ammonites measuring three or four inches\r\nacross the diameter of the coiled shell were about average size, but\r\ndiameters up to three or four feet were not uncommon. Externally the\r\nshells were ornamented with ribs, knobs, and spines; inside was a pearly\r\nlining. The partitions were thin and composed of the same pearl-like\r\nsubstance as the lining. Each partition becomes wavy as it approaches\r\nthe shell, and the line of union has a distinct pattern which is seen in\r\nspecimens which have lost the outer shell layer. This wavy suture line\r\nbecomes more complicated in the later members of the race, and the\r\npeculiar markings developed by the repeated partitions provide a\r\nconvenient method of identification.\r\n\r\nThe belemnites or ink-fishes, regarded as ancestors of the cuttlefishes\r\nnow living, comprise another group of carnivorous mollusks. These,\r\nhowever, had lost the external shell, and the usual fossil is part of an\r\ninternal shell or “skeleton,” known as the guard. This limy structure\r\nhas the form of a pointed cigar, and is seldom over a foot long although\r\nthe total body-length of the larger animals was commonly about six to\r\neight feet. Several hundred species have been described, the majority\r\nbeing of Jurassic age. They declined rapidly toward the close of the\r\nera.\r\n\r\nThe invertebrate life of the Mesozoic was strongly dominated by\r\nmollusks, with cephalopods in first place, the bivalve pelecypods and\r\nthe single-valve gastropods or snail-like forms sharing subordinate\r\npositions. The dominating trilobites, sea-scorpions, and tetracorals of\r\nthe Paleozoic had disappeared, while the brachiopods and crinoids were\r\ngreatly modified and more like the forms which live today.\r\n\r\nCrinoids became moderately abundant at various times, but in many ways\r\ndifferent from their relatives of the preceding era. Some of the largest\r\nknown species, with stems estimated as fifty feet long, have been found\r\nin lower Jurassic rocks. A great abundance of microscopic life is\r\nindicated by the frequent occurrence of chalk in the Cretaceous\r\nformations. Corals of the modern reef-building type (hexacorals) were\r\ncommon in the warm seas of a large part of the world.\r\n\r\nThe insects of the early Mesozoic are represented by few fossils\r\nalthough it is evident some new forms were becoming established. The\r\nwarm climates prevailing throughout much of the world appear to have\r\nbeen a favorable factor in the progress of insect life. In addition to\r\nthe older cockroach and dragon-fly types may be mentioned the arrival of\r\ngrasshoppers, cicadas, caddis-flies, beetles, and ants.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred species are found in Jurassic rocks, and by the end of\r\nthe Cretaceous period most of the insect families now known to us were\r\nprobably in existence. The record is seriously obscured by the erosion\r\nof rocks which so frequently marks the end of a period, also by the\r\nsmall size of the subjects, and by the exceptional conditions required\r\nfor the production of such delicate fossils. Among the last of the\r\nfamiliar insects to appear were the bees and butterflies. These\r\nevidently came in with the more advanced types of flowering plants that\r\nproduce the nectar on which many insects feed. It is probable, too, that\r\nwithout the arrival of these insects and their service in the\r\npollination of flowers, the floras of today would be rather different\r\nfrom what they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTINCT BIRDS\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising to find that birds made their first appearance in\r\nthe Mesozoic era, for of all animals they are most like the reptiles as\r\na class. Feathers are about the only dependable characteristic of the\r\nentire group, nearly every other feature being matched by some reptilian\r\ncreature of great antiquity. The nesting habit, which includes care of\r\nthe young as well as the eggs, is a matter of progress which relates to\r\nflight and to warmer body temperature. It appears to have been developed\r\nby forest-dwelling types living among trees and nesting there in\r\ncomparative safety from enemies prowling on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe oldest known prehistoric birds were found in lithographic stone of\r\nUpper Jurassic age. _Archaeopterix_ was discovered in 1861 at\r\nSolenhofen, Germany. Sixteen years later a similar bird in a better\r\nstate of preservation was found in Bavaria. The latter was named\r\n_Archaeornis_. These Jurassic fossils are regarded as true birds by some\r\nauthorities, while others believe them to be more nearly related to the\r\nreptiles, the opinions being based on careful studies of the skulls and\r\nother skeletal features. Both birds had teeth of reptilian character,\r\nand it is evident that there was no beak, for the jaws were covered with\r\nscaly skin. The bony construction of the long tail would suggest lizards\r\nrather than birds, were it not for the presence of feathers which were\r\nattached at each side. Head, neck, and parts of the body were covered\r\nwith scales. Wings were well provided with stout feathers but the\r\nskeletal framework indicates that the birds were gliders rather than\r\ntrue flyers. Claws on the wings served like fingers to aid in climbing\r\namong the branches of trees, a practice which is occasionally noted\r\namong the young of living birds. In adult birds of today, however, the\r\nclaw-like appendages of the fore limbs are greatly reduced and of little\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe next fossil birds of importance have been found in Cretaceous rocks\r\nof Kansas, both of them fishers of the seas instead of forest\r\ninhabitants. _Ichthyornis_ was a small bird, standing about eight inches\r\nin height, a powerful flyer with reptilian jaws and teeth. _Hesperornis_\r\nwas built for diving and swimming, like the loon, but was somewhat\r\nlarger and provided with teeth. Its wings were too poorly developed to\r\nbe of use in flying.\r\n\r\nToothed birds became extinct with the close of Cretaceous time, and the\r\nancestors of modern types were in existence before the Age of Mammals,\r\nbut fossil remains are few and poorly preserved. Large ostrich-like\r\nbirds, however, are known to have lived in North America during the\r\nEocene period. One of these, named _Diatryma_, stands nearly seven feet\r\ntall in the reconstructed skeleton. Its legs are heavy, wings greatly\r\nreduced, beak massive. In its relation to modern birds it is possibly\r\nnearer to the cranes than the ostriches.\r\n\r\nFlightless birds of large size are known from many parts of the world\r\nand seem to have been prominent throughout the Cenozoic era, as they are\r\ntoday in the southern hemisphere. _Aepyornis_ lived in Madagascar during\r\nthe Pleistocene period and may have become extinct quite recently. Its\r\neggs are the largest known among fossils, several times the size of an\r\nostrich egg. Also in this period the moas were living in New Zealand\r\nwhere their remains are still abundant. One of the largest, known as\r\n_Dinornis_, had about the same form as _Diatryma_ but the neck was\r\nlonger, head and beak smaller, legs better fitted for running, height\r\nabout eleven feet.\r\n\r\nA much smaller flightless bird, the dodo, became extinct in modern time.\r\nThis former inhabitant of Mauritius and other islands of the Indian\r\nOcean was related to the doves and pigeons, and had lost its power of\r\nflight through disuse of the wings. It was a clumsy, defenseless bird\r\nweighing possibly as much as fifty pounds. Actual remains are few and\r\nincomplete, and descriptions published by the explorers who knew the\r\nbird two centuries ago are not entirely trustworthy. In the Pleistocene\r\nRancho la Brea beds of California the largest of all prehistoric flying\r\nbirds has been found, a vulture bearing the name of _Teratornis_.\r\nRe-assembled skeletons show them to be slightly bigger than existing\r\ncondors.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCESTORS OF THE MAMMALS\r\n\r\nThe monotremes or egg-laying types of mammals such as the duck-bill and\r\nspiny anteaters which now inhabit Australia are almost unknown as\r\nfossils. Marsupials, the next higher living group, which includes the\r\nopossum and kangaroo, appeared at the end of Cretaceous time along with\r\nthe placentals or higher mammals which dominate the history of the\r\nCenozoic era. Nevertheless, there are a few teeth and jaws from rocks of\r\nTriassic and Jurassic age to indicate that small mammals, from the size\r\nof mice to slightly larger than rats, existed throughout most of the Age\r\nof Reptiles. There is no complete skeleton of any of the earlier forms,\r\nand little is known of their relationships either with living orders of\r\nmammals or with probable ancestors among the reptiles. The record\r\nbecomes somewhat clearer toward the end of the era but it is obscured\r\nagain by the great disturbances which followed.\r\n\r\nLooking back among earlier land animals for the origin of the first\r\nmammalian stock it is necessary to go as far as Permian or even\r\nCarboniferous time. Reptiles then living had many structural features in\r\ncommon with mammals, and mammal-like forms continued to flourish until\r\nlate in the Triassic. An interesting group of such animals, named\r\ntherapsids, was one of the earliest reptilian stocks to appear, and is\r\nwell known from fossils found in the Red Beds of Texas and New Mexico,\r\nin Europe, South Africa, and Asia. Quite a variety of types is included\r\nin this group, with many advances in dentition, and modifications of the\r\nskull, limbs and pelvic construction which strongly suggests a\r\nrelationship to the mammals.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Murals Over Fossil Exhibits, Hall of Mammals\r\n    Top: Eocene; Protylopus, Tanyorhinus, Patriofelis, Uintatherium,\r\n    Turtle, Crocodile, Eohippus.\r\n    Middle: Upper Oligocene; Mesohippus, Merycoidodon, Hoplophoneus,\r\n    Metamynodon, Poebrotherium, Trigonias.\r\n    Bottom: Pliocene; Teleoceras, Turtle, Synthetoceras, Amebelodon,\r\n    Teleoceras.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE AGE OF MAMMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe striking feature of life development in the Cenozoic era is the\r\ngreat progress and expansion over the earth of the mammalian races. The\r\ndivision of the era into periods, however, was based largely on a study\r\nof fossil mollusks. In the Paris basin of France, it was noticed by the\r\ngeologists of a century ago that the youngest of the sedimentary beds\r\ncontained the greatest number of recent or still living species.\r\nSuccessively downward into the older beds the percentage of recent\r\nspecies decreased until there were practically no living species\r\nrepresented in the oldest rocks of the series. From the percentage of\r\nrecent forms among prehistoric ones it was proposed that the following\r\ndivision be made: Eocene, meaning _dawn of the recent_; Miocene, meaning\r\nless recent; and Pliocene, meaning _more recent_. Sometime later it was\r\nsuggested that another period be added, and to this was given the name\r\nPleistocene, meaning _most recent_. In 1854, the older Miocene\r\nformations were segregated and referred to a newly provided Oligocene\r\nperiod, this name meaning _little of the recent_.\r\n\r\nEarly geologists grouped the rocks in three great divisions, applying\r\nthe names Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary. To these was added\r\nafterwards the name Quaternary, which applied to the youngest formations\r\nof the earth. Only two of these terms remain in common use at present:\r\nit is a frequent practice to refer to the combined Eocene, Oligocene,\r\nMiocene and Pliocene periods as the “Tertiary” division of Cenozoic\r\ntime; to the Pleistocene and Recent periods as the “Quaternary”\r\ndivision. The geology of some remote future may be clearer with regard\r\nto the full significance of this subdivision of the Age of Mammals into\r\ntwo parts. It may be that a great era was concluded at the end of\r\nPliocene time as others have been concluded, by the usual earth\r\ndisturbances and climatic changes and by the decline of animals once\r\nprominent in the faunas of the world. Events of such character have\r\nregistered their occurrence but may eventually prove to have been a\r\nseries of minor events not comparable with the revolutionary changes\r\nthat terminated other great time divisions. The favored practice of\r\nincluding ourselves and our times in the Cenozoic is based on a trend of\r\nopinion which holds that no great era has been ended since the Age of\r\nReptiles was concluded.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Skulls of the clumsy, six-horned uintathere and the\r\n    early, hornless titanothere form part of this Eocene display. In the\r\n    mural these animals and the little “three-toed” Eohippus, smallest\r\n    of horses, are pictured with a contemporary turtle and crocodile.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest of Eocene rocks show a great variety of mammals and a strange\r\nassortment of forms far in advance of the Mesozoic record. Ancestries\r\nand successive stages of development have been only partially worked\r\nout, though details have been better preserved for some of the groups\r\nthan for others. Some oddly shaped creatures such as the uintatheres\r\nreached their full development in a relatively short time and passed out\r\nof the picture before the end of the period. These animals, represented\r\nin our collection by _Uintacolotherium_, acquired large bodies and many\r\nhorns, but a peculiar tooth equipment fitted them for a special diet\r\nwhich apparently failed to be supplied in sufficient abundance at a\r\ncritical time.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we find in this period the ancestors of more\r\nsuccessful groups, some of which continue on into modern times. Only a\r\nfew of these histories can be traced in a brief sketch, but in a general\r\nway it may be stated that the successful races had modest beginnings and\r\nthat they developed very slowly into what they are now, by a process of\r\nadjusting themselves, or by becoming better adapted to new or previously\r\nunused conditions in their respective environments. In their early\r\nstages the various types had much in common; they were generalized,\r\nrather than specialized for any particular kind of existence. What they\r\nwere fitted for is best indicated by their teeth and feet, though other\r\nstructural features frequently contribute valuable information. The rise\r\nof mentality is indicated by skull capacities and the increasing\r\ndevelopment of the upper lobes of the brain, as revealed by casts taken\r\nfrom the interior of skulls.\r\n\r\nThe creodonts were the earliest and most primitive of the flesh-eating\r\nmammals or carnivores. Many of them were small of body and brain, and\r\nequipped with teeth that indicate a mixed or largely insectivorous diet,\r\nor possibly the habit of feeding on carrion. Although there was\r\nconsiderable variation among them, and some tendency toward\r\nspecialization, there was little to suggest the coming of more\r\nprogressive groups such as the cats and dogs, with teeth perfected for\r\nthe tearing and cutting of flesh, and feet especially fitted for the\r\nlife of hunters. The ancestry of the cats cannot be traced farther back\r\nthan the Oligocene but it probably connects somewhere prior to that time\r\nwith the creodonts.\r\n\r\n_Cynodictis_, an Oligocene carnivore slightly under two feet in length\r\nis commonly regarded as a primitive dog, but its characters are so\r\ngeneralized that it probably differs but little from the ancestors of\r\nmany other carnivores. The skeleton of this animal suggests a slender\r\nand flexible body like that of the weasel, with somewhat shortened limbs\r\nand a long tail. It lived in forested regions and was probably more or\r\nless of a tree dweller. The more advanced carnivores required longer\r\nlegs, better adapted for running and overtaking the prey, which is the\r\ndog’s way of hunting, or for stalking and springing upon the quarry,\r\nwhich is the method of the cat.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Moropus (_Moropus cooki_)\r\n\r\n    Though its teeth clearly indicate a diet of plant material, this\r\n    strange animal had claws on its toes, like the carnivores. It is\r\n    probable that the claws were used in digging for roots, as indicated\r\n    by the artist.]\r\n\r\nA prominent group of mammals today is that known as the ungulates, or\r\nhoofed animals, which includes the horses, cattle, deer, swine,\r\nrhinoceroses, tapirs, and other types both living and extinct. Their\r\nprobable ancestors were the condylarths, primitive ungulates of the\r\nEocene period. One of these, known as _Phenacodus_, serves well to\r\nillustrate the general character of the early hoofed mammals. It was\r\nabout five and one-half feet long, rather large for its time, with long\r\ntail and short limbs, low elongated skull and small brain, very similar\r\nin many respects to the creodonts or ancestral carnivores. The teeth,\r\nhowever, were partially of the grinding type so essential to the welfare\r\nof plant feeders.\r\n\r\nThe condylarths were five-toed animals and evidently provided with small\r\nhoofs, but the more progressive ungulates soon lost one or more of the\r\ntoes, and a division of the group into odd-toed and even-toed branches\r\nbecame firmly established. Consequently, the families of ungulates\r\nhaving one, three, or five toes are classed together as being closely\r\nrelated to one another, and those having two or four toes are segregated\r\nin a second lot. The odd-toed clan, known as perissodactyls, included\r\nsuch animals as the horses, rhinoceroses, tapirs, and titanotheres, each\r\nof these types being placed in a separate family. The even-toed clan has\r\nbeen treated in a similar way and named the artiodactyls. In this\r\ndivision are such families as swine, cattle, deer, camels, oreodonts,\r\nand others. The odd-toed group dominated among the larger animals of\r\nNorth America for a time but has been completely replaced by the\r\neven-toed division which is still flourishing, although some of the\r\nolder families have become extinct.\r\n\r\nAmong the exhibits of the Denver Museum of Natural History may be seen\r\ncomplete skeletons of extinct horses, rhinoceroses, titanotheres, and\r\nchalicotheres representing the perissodactyls. _Moropus_ was one of the\r\nchalicotheres, an exceptional family which never became very prominent\r\nalthough it had a prolonged history and persisted in Europe and Asia\r\nafter its extinction in North America. The family is grouped with the\r\nungulates because of many similarities found in the molar teeth, skulls,\r\nand other parts of the skeletons, but the toes were provided with claws\r\ninstead of hoofs. The use of these claws is somewhat of a puzzle:\r\npossibly for defense against carnivorous enemies, for dragging down\r\nbranches in order to obtain food, or for digging roots which may have\r\nbeen an important part of the diet.\r\n\r\nTitanotheres are represented in our collection by the skeletons of the\r\nlarge, horned type which was the last of the race and destined to\r\nextinction by the middle of the Oligocene period. Smaller hornless\r\nvarieties of Eocene time are illustrated by skulls. This family of\r\nungulates had an unprogressive dental equipment, and a small brain in a\r\nflattened skull. The molar teeth readily distinguish the group from\r\nother ungulates and enable us to trace the relationship between earlier\r\nand later varieties. These teeth were of a type which is soon destroyed\r\nby wear, and it is evident that the animals survived only so long as\r\ntheir environment provided them with an abundance of soft vegetation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Titanotheres of Oligocene Time\r\n\r\n    The name of these animals refers to the large size though they were\r\n    greatly exceeded in bulk by the mastodons and mammoths of later\r\n    periods. Ancestral titanotheres, dating back to the Eocene, were\r\n    hornless animals of much smaller size. These splendid specimens were\r\n    obtained in Weld County, Colorado.]\r\n\r\nThe large assortment of rhinoceros material provides an idea of the\r\ngreat abundance and variety of forms in this family which was once\r\nprominent in North America but no longer among the inhabitants of that\r\ncontinent. Some of the mounted skeletons have been restored on one side\r\nto show how these animals appeared in the flesh.\r\n\r\nOf the even-toed ungulates there are also several types illustrated by\r\ncomplete skeletons. _Merycochoerus_, the subject of one of our mounted\r\ngroups, represents the oreodonts, a large family of mammals whose\r\nhistory begins with the Upper Eocene and ends in the Lower Pliocene. The\r\noreodonts were small animals, rather pig-like in form and quite common\r\nin the western plains region shortly after the time of the titanotheres.\r\nAncient swine are represented in our exhibits by two mounted skeletons\r\nwhich were obtained from northeastern Colorado, where the bones were\r\nfound associated with rhinoceros and titanothere remains. Some of these\r\nanimals were of very large proportions, and the entire family is\r\ncommonly known as the “giant pigs.”\r\n\r\nCamels and closely related forms were quite abundant in North America\r\nfrom early Oligocene to comparatively recent time. Numerous types were\r\ndeveloped during the course of their history, some small and delicately\r\nformed, others tall and clumsy and much like the giraffe in structure.\r\nParts of many of these creatures have been found but the only completely\r\nprepared skeletons in our collection are of the little gazelle-camel,\r\n_Stenomylus_, from Lower Miocene deposits in northwestern Nebraska.\r\nPleistocene bisons are represented by several complete skeletons and\r\nnumerous skulls and horncores, some of the species showing an extreme\r\ndevelopment in the length of horns. With two of the bison skeletons are\r\nshown prehistoric weapon points, found with the bones and indicating\r\nthat these animals were hunted by primitive men at some time near the\r\nclose of the Ice Age. The artifacts first discovered near Folsom, New\r\nMexico, by field workers of our Museum, have become known to\r\narcheologists as Folsom points.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREHISTORIC HORSES\r\n\r\nThe past history of horses is well known from an abundance of fossil\r\nmaterial, ranging in age from the Eocene down to the present. Modern\r\nhorses have only one toe in each foot, but there are remnants of two\r\nadditional toes which may be seen only in the bony structure underlying\r\nthe skin. Most of their ancestral relatives were three-toed as far back\r\nas the Oligocene period. During Eocene time, however, there was a stage\r\nwhich may be regarded as four-toed although it was evidently a temporary\r\ncondition, linking known horses with more remote forms having five toes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Oligocene Mammals From Weld County, Colorado\r\n\r\n    The giant pigs (_Archaeotherium mortoni_) at the left of the group,\r\n    and the rhinoceros (_Trigonias osborni_) were common animals of the\r\n    western plains region at one time.]\r\n\r\n_Eohippus_, the “dawn horse” as it has been called, is one of the oldest\r\nand best known of the American horses. Its relation to existing members\r\nof the family can be traced by means of changes in tooth structure as\r\nwell as in the gradual reduction in the number of toes that is seen\r\namong intermediate forms. Its ancestors some day may be positively\r\nidentified in that group of generalized, primitive, five-toed, hoofed\r\nmammals which are known to have lived at the beginning of the mammalian\r\nera, but such identification has not yet been established. Even\r\n_Eohippus_ bore little resemblance to the familiar horse of today. Its\r\nheight was only eleven inches, and in body form it had much of the\r\nappearance of a modern dog. There were four toes on the front foot, one\r\nof them decidedly shorter than the others but complete in all its parts,\r\nand evidently capable of service in carrying a portion of the animal’s\r\nweight. The hind foot had three complete toes and a tiny remnant of a\r\nfourth which could not have been apparent externally.\r\n\r\nAs changes in the structure of the feet progressed, the central toe of\r\nthe original five continued to increase in size while the adjacent\r\ndigits became relatively shorter and eventually so reduced in length\r\nthat they could touch the ground no longer. The smaller bones at the\r\nextremities, corresponding to the joints of our fingers and toes,\r\neventually disappeared from the side toes. Then the longer bones of the\r\nouter digits lost the broadened supporting surface, where the missing\r\ntoes had been attached, and became reduced to pointed remnants known as\r\nsplints. Extreme shortening of the splint bones eventually leaves only a\r\nsmall knob which is often referred to as a rudimentary toe. In the\r\nskeleton of a large horse the splints are readily seen, but in some of\r\nthe earlier species they are so small that they may easily be destroyed\r\nor overlooked by the collector who removes the fossilized material from\r\nthe surrounding rocks. Even then, the bones of the wrist and ankle may\r\nindicate in an unmistakable manner that an additional toe once was\r\npresent, for each bone is supported by another, and at the point of\r\nattachment there is a characteristic surface whose purpose is usually\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Cenozoic era the changes continued. Among the horses of\r\nthe North American Oligocene were _Mesohippus_, approximately the size\r\nof a collie dog, and _Miohippus_ which was slightly larger. Both were\r\nthree-toed, but the rudimentary splint of a fourth toe was still present\r\nin the front foot. _Parahippus_ and _Merychippus_ carried on during the\r\nMiocene period, the latter being characteristic of the time, and\r\nshowing, in addition to other progress, a decided trend toward the\r\nmodern structure of molar teeth. There was some increase in size but the\r\nlargest horse of that period was hardly more than a small pony.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A Pleistocene Horse of the Texas Plains (_Equus\r\n    scotti_)]\r\n\r\n_Hipparion_ and _Protohippus_, living during Upper Miocene and Pliocene\r\ntime, represent later stages of the three-toed condition. The side toes\r\nwere completely formed but greatly shortened, only the central toe\r\ntouching the ground. In some of the species the outer toes had also\r\nbecome very slender, approaching the splint condition. By this time the\r\nmolar teeth were longer and better adapted for feeding on grasses which\r\nwere becoming sufficiently abundant to attract some of the forest\r\ndwellers into the open country.\r\n\r\nDuring the Pliocene period, in the genus _Pliohippus_ and also in\r\n_Hipparion_, the feet were far advanced in structure, with most of the\r\nspecies single-toed, the side digits having reached the splint stage.\r\nPleistocene horses of the genus _Equus_, like living species of that\r\ngenus, were strictly one-toed animals, ranging over grassy areas and\r\nhighly specialized for a life in that kind of environment.\r\n\r\nSpecialization is to be noted partly in the foot and leg structures\r\nwhere the modifications have contributed to greater speed and travelling\r\nability. This is of great service to an animal of the plains where food\r\nand water are often scarce, and great distances frequently have to be\r\ncovered in order to obtain sustenance. The horse, as we know it, is\r\nbuilt for speed, its limbs and feet being elongated to permit a greater\r\nstride, and also modified to decrease the weight without loss of\r\nstrength. The ordinary ball-and-socket joint is replaced by a\r\npulley-like construction which limits the direction of movement but\r\nprovides an excellent mechanism for locomotion, especially over flat,\r\nopen ground. Flexibility in other directions is sacrificed for greater\r\nstrength, and the foot incidentally becomes less suited for other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThis is what is meant by “specialization”—a departure from\r\n“generalization.” The study of fossils provides numerous illustrations\r\nof specialized development which contributes greatly to an interest in\r\nprehistoric life. Any specialized structure or habit which increases\r\nfitness for a particular way of living is also known as an “adaptation.”\r\nQuite in line with the idea of specialization and adaptation is the\r\nchange which occurred in the construction of the horses’ teeth, for the\r\ndental equipment of the modern grazing animals differs widely from that\r\nof the browsing creatures which lived on the soft leaves and other plant\r\nsubstances of the forests.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Structure of Molar Teeth\r\n\r\n    The large lower molar of a long-jawed mastodon shows worn and unworn\r\n    cusps, with the enamel layer forming a heavy border around the\r\n    central dentine where the surface covering has been worn through. In\r\n    the grinding teeth of rhinoceroses (illustrated at the right) the\r\n    crown pattern is quite different, but both types are adapted for\r\n    softer foods and are similar in having the protective enamel on the\r\n    outside only. The central tooth shows the condition after the\r\n    shallow surface depressions have been removed by wear.]\r\n\r\nThe cheek teeth or grinding equipment of the horses underwent as\r\ncomplete a change as the feet. Modification resulted in a new type of\r\ntooth which enabled herbivorous animals to take advantage of a kind of\r\nvegetation which was late in arriving and has since become the principal\r\ndiet of the ungulates. The grasses are coarse and harsh as compared with\r\nthe leaves of forest shrubbery, requiring more thorough grinding to make\r\nthem digestible. In addition they contain minute particles of silica,\r\nwhich is a highly abrasive mineral that quickly wears down the tooth\r\nsubstance, especially the softer materials found in tooth construction.\r\nAn increase in the length of the tooth would offset the excessive wear\r\nbut would not necessarily produce a better mechanism for grinding.\r\n\r\nThe fulfillment of the new requirements is to be seen in the change from\r\nwhat is known as the low-crowned, browsing type of molar, to the\r\nhigh-crowned, grazing type. Details of the changes that may be traced\r\nthrough millions of years of gradual adjustment become apparent only\r\nfrom the examination of a great deal of fossil material. As compared\r\nwith earlier types of construction, a modern molar tooth may appear\r\nextremely complicated, but the process which brought about the improved\r\nquality is very simple. A little discussion of tooth structure, however,\r\nis required to make this clear.\r\n\r\nA tooth, as everyone knows, is partly imbedded in the jaw, partly\r\nexposed outside the gum. In a short-crowned tooth the exposed portion is\r\nknown as the crown, and the part imbedded in the jaw consists of one or\r\nmore roots which are comparatively long. The crown is nearly always\r\nprotected by a thin layer of hard enamel. In a grinding tooth, the\r\nworking surface has a number of more or less prominent elevations known\r\nas cusps. The enamel layer completely covers this surface until wear\r\nbegins. As the tooth goes into service the signs of use begin to appear;\r\nthe enamel is soon worn from the tops of the cusps, and the underlying\r\nsubstance, called dentine, becomes exposed. This is far less resistant\r\nto wear, and as the enamel continues to be reduced the tooth becomes\r\nless efficient as a grinding device, partly because of the smoothing off\r\nof the surface, partly because of the relative softness of the inner\r\nmaterial which is being exposed in increasing quantity. A very old molar\r\ntooth of the low-crowned type has a smooth surface from which almost the\r\nlast trace of the enamel has been removed. In many prehistoric animals\r\nthe enamel is of a darker color than the dentine or cement, this\r\ndifference in color enabling one to see at a glance how the teeth are\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Grazing Type of Molar Teeth\r\n\r\n    The side view of the bison’s molar and premolar equipment\r\n    illustrates the elongated construction which is common among grazing\r\n    animals. In the pattern of the grinding surface may be seen a cross\r\n    section of the enamel layers. One layer surrounds each tooth while\r\n    two folded “cylinders” of the same material occupy the interior.]\r\n\r\nIn a long-crowned tooth the roots are usually very short, for much of\r\nthe crown itself is imbedded in jaw bone, and the longer roots are not\r\nrequired. Growth of the tooth is usually completed after a few years;\r\nthen as it is gradually worn away it is continuously moved upward by the\r\nproduction of new bone under the roots, which slowly fills the bottom of\r\nthe socket and continues to provide the necessary support. An equally\r\nimportant difference between the two types of teeth, however, is to be\r\nseen in the arrangement of the enamel, the long-crowned type being\r\nprovided with this durable substance on the inside of the crown instead\r\nof having a mere protective cap on the outside.\r\n\r\nThe more complicated structure was developed from the simpler form by\r\nthe easy method of deepening certain depressions located between cusps\r\nat the top of the tooth. As the crown of the tooth increased its length\r\nthese depressions remained tucked in, and eventually became deep pits\r\nroughly cylindrical in shape. In addition to the enamel and dentine, a\r\nthird tooth substance, known as the cement, made its appearance at about\r\nthis time, and we find that quantities of this new material were\r\ndeposited outside the crown enamel and also inside the enamel walls of\r\nthe pit, in this way producing a firmly consolidated structure otherwise\r\nweakened by deep channels and hollow pockets. The cement differs only\r\nslightly from the dentine but is deposited while the uncut tooth is in\r\nthe gum tissues of the mouth, the enamel and dentine elements being\r\nformed earlier in the embryonic tooth before it emerges from the jaw\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nA tooth constructed by such a process, if cross-sectioned through the\r\ncrown, will be found to consist of successive layers of hard and softer\r\nmaterials. In living animals the top of the tooth soon wears off and the\r\nenamel layers stand in higher relief because of their greater resistance\r\nto wear. A roughened surface of excellent grinding quality is thus\r\nprovided, and as long as the wear continues there remains the same\r\nrelative amount of enamel to retain the roughness, and resist abrasion.\r\n\r\nAmong the various types of grazing animals there is a marked difference\r\nin the arrangement and form of the enamel layers. Within a species of\r\ngenus, however, the complicated enamel patterns of the molar teeth are\r\nconsistently similar. In the case of horses especially, these patterns\r\nprovide a most helpful key to the identification of extinct forms. The\r\ngeneral pattern, in any of the more modern horses, may be understood\r\nmore readily if the wavy enamel layers be regarded as forming a set of\r\ncylinders with deeply crinkled walls. Near the outer border of the\r\ntooth, surrounded by a thin layer of cement, is the enclosing cylinder\r\nwhich represents the enamel cap of the old-fashioned, low-crowned tooth.\r\nInside of this is the central mass of dentine which has been penetrated\r\nby two of the deep pits previously mentioned. The original enamel cap\r\nhas been depressed into these pits, forming two inner cylinders which\r\nare filled with cement. Instead of being circular in outline, when the\r\ncap is worn through at the grinding surface these inner cylinder walls\r\nare seen to be wrinkled and folded so as to produce a most irregular\r\npattern. However, if several teeth of the same kind of horse are\r\ncompared, it will be found that the edges of these cylinders produce\r\nfigures which are remarkably uniform and characteristic for that\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: American Mastodon (_Mastodon americanus_)\r\n    A true mastodon of the short-jawed type.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMASTODONS AND MAMMOTHS\r\n\r\nElephant-like mammals both living and extinct are classed together in a\r\nsingle order bearing the name Proboscidea. Living members of the group\r\nare the elephants, of which the large Indian and African species are\r\nbest known. Among prehistoric representatives the most frequently\r\nmentioned in the popular literature of North American animals are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nThe American Mastodon, an immigrant from Siberia which ranged over\r\nnearly all of the United States and Canada. It was principally a forest\r\ndweller, rarely found in plains regions, was abundant during the\r\nPleistocene period and may have been known to the early American\r\nIndians;\r\n\r\nThe Woolly Mammoth, which was about nine feet tall. It ranged over\r\nBritish Columbia into the United States and across to the Atlantic,\r\ndisappearing in late Pleistocene time;\r\n\r\nThe Columbian Mammoth, about eleven feet tall, lived in the early half\r\nof the Pleistocene period, ranging over the warmer portions of North\r\nAmerica, including practically all of the United States and much of\r\nMexico;\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Mammoth, reaching a height of more than thirteen feet, and\r\nbecoming extinct in the Middle Pleistocene. It was a western form,\r\nremains being found from Nebraska to Mexico City.\r\n\r\nOriginally placed in the genus _Elephas_, the mammoths are referred to\r\ncommonly as elephants, though technically they should not be regarded as\r\nsuch. Recent explorations and researches have added greatly to our\r\nknowledge of these animals but have also caused much confusion with\r\nregard to scientific names, for many new subdivisions of the larger\r\ngroup are now recognized, and it has become necessary to change some of\r\nthe older nomenclature.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A Long-Jawed Mastodont (_Trilophodon phippsi_).\r\n    One of the Early American Proboscideans]\r\n\r\nThe large mammoth exhibited by the Museum bears the impressive name of\r\n_Archidiskodon meridionalis nebrascensis_. Fifty years ago it might have\r\nbeen identified simply as a specimen of the imperial elephant and in\r\nsuch case would have received the old name of that species, which was\r\n_Elephas imperator_. But late in the last century it was proposed that\r\nthe mammoths be recognized by some other name to distinguish them more\r\nsharply from living elephants. The name suggested for the new genus thus\r\nestablished was _Archidiskodon_, in recognition of the more archaic or\r\nprimitive construction of the enamel plates in the mammoths molar teeth.\r\nThe specific name, _meridionalis_, had been given to a kind of mammoth\r\nwhich is well known from the southern part of Europe, and the Latin\r\nname, signifying “southern,” had been applied to differentiate this\r\nspecies from the northern or woolly mammoth.\r\n\r\nThis mammoth, however, had disappeared from southern Europe and for many\r\nyears its subsequent history remained a mystery. The late Dr. Henry\r\nFairfield Osborn had been engaged in an extensive study of the subject,\r\nand when the nearly perfect skeleton from Angus, Nebraska, was brought\r\nto his attention he recognized it as being closely related to\r\n_meridionalis_, and considered it to be a record of the migration of\r\nthat species into North America. Because of minor variations from the\r\ntypical mammoth of southern Europe he regarded it as a variety or\r\nsubspecies which had descended from the latter, and the subspecific\r\nname, _nebrascensis_, was added to take care of this situation, using a\r\nLatinized form of the name of the State in which the skeleton was found.\r\nWith the knowledge we now have of these mammoths it becomes apparent\r\nthat _Archidiskodon meridionalis nebrascensis_ is an ancestor of the\r\nimperial mammoth, currently known as _Archidiskodon imperator_, and not\r\nidentical with it.\r\n\r\nThis instance is typical of the manner in which prehistoric animals\r\nobtain their names. Although given a Latin form, these technical names\r\nare derived from many languages, and the root words are applied with\r\nreference to anything that happens to appeal to the author as\r\nsignificant. Consequently there is seldom a name of this kind which may\r\nbe translated directly into natural history or science. It is a mistake\r\nto believe that these strange phrases conceal important technical\r\ninformation which is available only to those who are familiar with dead\r\nand foreign languages. Actually they contain nothing of the sort, and\r\nthe most enlightened of the Greeks and Romans could not find it there.\r\nWhen a name is needed there is none better than the one provided by the\r\nspecialist who is skilled in the business of naming things. Some\r\ntechnical ability is required, to apply the name where it properly\r\nbelongs, but technical knowledge is not obtained from such sources.\r\nNames, in any form, have another purpose to serve. There is no magic in\r\nthem and there need be no mystery about them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Molar Tooth of Mammoth\r\n\r\n    This type of tooth is constructed for long continued use and will\r\n    withstand the wear of more abrasive foods. The position of the white\r\n    enamel plates is seen in this view of the grinding surface. These\r\n    plates extend all the way to the base of the tooth, which is of the\r\n    long-crowned variety and not to be destroyed by the wearing away of\r\n    a single outside layer of enamel.]\r\n\r\nOther specimens in the Museum collection are the long-jawed mastodonts,\r\nso named because of the elongated jaws and protruding chin which is\r\noften mistaken for a tusk. Early members of this group had more cheek\r\nteeth than later types of mastodons, and longer jaws were required for\r\ntheir accommodation. Some of them had flattened lower tusks which\r\nevidently were used for digging purposes. These are popularly known as\r\n“shovel tuskers.” The more modern American mastodon had shorter jaws\r\nand, like the mammoths and elephants, only one pair of tusks. Both the\r\nlong-jawed and short-jawed types are represented by complete skeletons,\r\nand also by tusks, jaws, and teeth of many individuals. The American\r\nmastodons and mastodonts were of about the same size as the smaller\r\nmammoths.\r\n\r\nThe difference between mastodons and mammoths is most readily recognized\r\nin the structure of the grinding teeth, the molars and pre-molars. In\r\nthe mastodon these teeth are of the short-crowned type, while in the\r\nmammoths, as in the modern elephants, they are long-crowned. The\r\ndifference between these two types of molars has been described with\r\nreference to horses, and the change from the older to the modern form\r\nmay be regarded as coming about in the same general way, through a\r\nseries of gradual modifications. In both horse and mammoth the final\r\ndevelopment shows internal enamel extending from the grinding surface\r\nnearly to the roots. Otherwise, however, there is almost no resemblance,\r\nfor the mammoth tooth is made up of flattened enamel plates, the number\r\nof which is variable for different species. In the jaws of a very young\r\nindividual these plates may be seen as separate parts. As the tooth\r\ncontinues to grow, the plates become cemented together, and when the\r\nends of the plate are worn down it may be observed that each consists of\r\na layer of enamel surrounding a flat central core of dentine. The type\r\nof construction is rather more obvious in the mammoth tooth than in that\r\nof a horse, partly because of the larger size, and partly because of the\r\nrelative simplicity of construction.\r\n\r\nThe earlier history of the Proboscidea is not recorded in the rocks of\r\nNorth America, for the group was of African origin and its migrations\r\ndid not extend as far as the New World until middle Cenozoic times. The\r\nmastodons and mammoths were the largest of land animals since the Age of\r\nReptiles, but their Old World ancestors were not conspicuous because of\r\ntheir bulk. Many of these ancient forms, even in the earliest stages,\r\nreveal some of the prominent characters that dominate the entire group.\r\nNone of them, however, should be regarded as a miniature mammoth or\r\nmastodon, for these highly specialized types were perfected only at a\r\ncomparatively recent date, and by a process that works very slowly.\r\nAmong the earlier forms there were also some oddities which failed to\r\nsurvive or to produce a successful branch of the stock such as the\r\nelephants.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Nebraska Mammoth\r\n    (_Archidiskodon meridionalis nebrascensis_)]\r\n\r\nThe earliest known member of the order was _Moeritherium_, an animal of\r\nthe size of a tapir, living in Egypt during the late Eocene and early\r\nOligocene time. At this stage the characteristic specializations leading\r\nto the mastodons and mammoths were apparent but not far advanced. The\r\nproboscis was probably much like the flexible snout of modern tapirs,\r\nfor the need of a long trunk had not yet arrived. In upper and lower\r\njaws the second pair of incisor teeth were becoming large and prominent.\r\nThe enormous tusks of the mammoths later developed from the enlargement\r\nof the same pair of upper incisors, and in some of the long-jawed\r\nmastodonts the lower pair also produced large tusks, though frequently\r\nthe lower tusks were not prominent.\r\n\r\n_Dinotherium_ had downward-growing tusks in the lower jaws, none in the\r\nupper. This genus was fairly common in the Miocene of Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica. In the tropics it survived throughout the Pliocene and possibly\r\ninto the Pleistocene. Some of the species acquired the size of\r\nelephants, but it is apparent that they were not ancestral to any of the\r\nmore progressive types. They are to be regarded rather as an offshoot\r\nfrom the main line of descent.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 only ten species of the elephant-like mammals were known, and\r\nall were referred to a single genus. At the present time eleven genera\r\nappear to be well founded, and the number of recognized species has\r\nreached a hundred, if it has not already passed that figure. New\r\ndiscoveries are expected to add to the existing total. With this mass of\r\nmaterial before us we note certain definite trends among the more\r\nprogressive types. The increasing weight was accompanied by the\r\ndevelopment of strong, upright limbs in which the bones have a columnar\r\nposition instead of the angular assembly which prevails among most of\r\nthe mammals. As the tusks increased in size there was a shortening of\r\nboth skull and neck to bring the weight closer to the point of support.\r\nThe front teeth disappeared except the second pair of upper incisors\r\nwhich remain as tusks in the modern elephant. The cheek teeth present in\r\nthe shortened jaws of the mammoth were reduced to one pair at a time in\r\nthe upper set and another pair below. From a simple, low-crowned origin\r\nthese grinding teeth developed into the more successful high-crowned\r\npattern with numerous plates of enamel inside. A prehensile upper lip\r\nacquired the length and usefulness of the elephants trunk.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Rancho la Brea Fossils\r\n\r\n    One of the most unusual of the many animals that have been taken\r\n    from the tar pits is the large ground sloth, seen at the left in\r\n    this group. Such sloths were very abundant during Pleistocene time,\r\n    and some may have lived up to a few thousand years ago.\r\n    Archaeologists have found indications that these creatures may have\r\n    been hunted by cave-dwelling peoples of the American Southwest.\r\n\r\n    Other skeletons include the saber-tooth tiger, characterized by the\r\n    long curved upper canine teeth which undoubtedly were used for\r\n    stabbing and slashing, and the dire wolf, the smaller of the two\r\n    which are facing the sloth. The artist’s reconstruction of this\r\n    scene also shows the great vulture, Teratornis, which is the largest\r\n    known bird of flight.]\r\n\r\nOver-specialization in the production of tusks appears to have been the\r\nprincipal factor in the downfall of the mammoths. The large size of the\r\nanimals and the difficulties of finding sufficient food to sustain life\r\nmust have been a serious handicap at times, but their ability and\r\ninclination to travel over long distances enabled some of them to find\r\ntolerable living conditions until the end of the Glacial Period. They\r\nare now extinct and the nearest living relatives are the elephants,\r\nsomewhat reduced in size of tusks and body but otherwise very similar.\r\n\r\nThere are many other tribes of mammals whose ancient history is\r\npartially known though broken by periods of time for which there is no\r\nfossil evidence. All have undergone changes in which various forms and\r\ndegrees of specialization are featured; this general process is best\r\nrevealed by the horses and elephant-like animals which have left a\r\nclearer record. For other groups the story would differ but little\r\nexcept as to names and specific details.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RANCHO LA BREA FOSSIL PITS\r\n\r\nThe La Brea tar pits, as they are often called, provide a remarkable\r\nrecord of Pleistocene life in southwestern North America. Scattered over\r\nan area of about thirty acres just off Wilshire Boulevard in Los\r\nAngeles, these bone deposits were known, as far back as 1875, to contain\r\nthe remains of prehistoric animals. It was not until 1905, however, that\r\ntheir value was recognized by paleontologists. In that year the\r\nUniversity of California began an investigation, and excavations were\r\ncarried on at intervals by various institutions during the next ten\r\nyears. A great deal of material was acquired by the Los Angeles Museum\r\nof History, Science, and Art, where many skeletons, skulls, and other\r\ninteresting specimens have been placed on exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe pits have the form of small craters formed by the seeping of oil\r\nfrom the underlying rocks. The seeps appear to have been active during\r\npart of the Pleistocene period but apparently not at the beginning. The\r\noil is rich in asphalt which has served as a preservative for the bones,\r\nand owing to its sticky properties has been an effective animal trap for\r\nthousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe fossil beds at present are of oil-soaked earth and sand. In past\r\ntimes there must have been a greater percentage of oil, often concealed\r\nby a layer of dust or pools of water. The large number of carnivorous\r\nanimals found in the deposits suggests that they were attracted by the\r\ncries and struggles of creatures wandering carelessly into the asphalt\r\nand serving as live bait to keep the traps in continuous operation.\r\n\r\nAnimals found there include many species still living in the locality,\r\nsome that have migrated to other territory, and a large number that have\r\nbecome extinct. Among the latter may be mentioned species that differ\r\nbut slightly from living relatives, others that have left no\r\ndescendants. Horses, bison, and wolves, though extinct species, were of\r\nrelatively modern types. On the other hand the large sloths and\r\nsaber-tooth cats seem rather out of place. True cats are represented by\r\nthe mountain-lion, bob-cat, and a species of lion which is nearly\r\none-fourth larger than any of the great cats of the Old World. A\r\nlong-legged camel, with a height of approximately eight feet to the top\r\nof the head, was among the native animals of the district. Skunks,\r\nweasels, badgers, squirrels, rabbits, bear, deer, and antelope were more\r\nor less abundant.\r\n\r\nThe La Brea group exhibited by the Denver Museum of Natural History\r\nincludes the following species: horse (_Equus occidentalis_), bison\r\n(_Bison antiquus_), wolf (_Aenocyon dirus_), saber tooth (_Smilodon\r\ncalifornicus_), sloth (_Mylodon harlani_). Horses had entirely\r\ndisappeared from the North American continent by the time the first\r\nwhite man arrived. _Equus occidentalis_ was one of the several species\r\nliving during the Pleistocene period, this one apparently being\r\nrestricted to California and perhaps adjacent states. _Bison antiquus_\r\nwas slightly larger than the plains bison of recent times and had it\r\nhorns set at a characteristic different angle. The species was first\r\ndescribed from Kentucky and appears to have had a wide distribution.\r\n\r\nThe wolves in this group are about the size of timber wolves, but have\r\nheavier skulls with less brain capacity, massive teeth especially\r\nadapted to biting and crushing large bones, and limbs of rather light\r\nconstruction. They probably assembled in packs where meat was abundant\r\nand, hunting in this fashion, were able to attack and overcome the\r\nlarger ungulates and edentates. To most visitors the large ground sloth\r\nis the most interesting animal of the group. This edentate animal is\r\nshown at the edge of the pool with one foot stuck in the “tar.”\r\n\r\nThe edentates are a group of primitive animals with very simple teeth,\r\nif any. Teeth are usually lacking in the front part of the mouth,\r\nsometimes entirely absent, as among anteaters. Better known living\r\nrepresentatives of the group are the tree sloths, armadillos, and\r\nanteaters of South America. Ground-sloths were prominent among South\r\nAmerican mammals during much of Cenozoic time. During Pliocene and\r\nMiocene time there was a marked tendency to large size, and it was\r\nprincipally during these two periods that they appeared in the United\r\nStates area.\r\n\r\n_Mylodon_ was one of the larger North American ground-sloths. Its teeth,\r\nwithout the protective enamel which is present among higher mammals, are\r\nrestricted to the cheek region, and have the form of simple pegs;\r\ninstead of being specialized they stand close to the extreme of\r\ngeneralization. The construction of the entire skeleton is massive,\r\nsuggesting great strength with slow movements. The hands are well\r\ndeveloped, provided with stout claws, and must have served the creature\r\nwell as protection against attacks by predatory neighbors. We have some\r\nidea as to what caused the extermination of the ground-sloths in this\r\nparticular region, but the complete disappearance of such a large and\r\nwidely distributed group at the close of the Pleistocene period is a\r\nmystery that may never be explained.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Folsom, New Mexico, Bison (_Bison taylori_)]\r\n\r\nThe saber-tooth cat, sometimes referred to as a tiger, was specialized\r\nas a meat eater though hardly as a hunting animal. In the La Brea region\r\nits principal food was probably the flesh of the sluggish ground-sloths.\r\nThe size was equal to that of the African lion, with hind limbs slightly\r\nlonger and the front legs more powerfully developed. The most remarkable\r\ncharacteristic is to be found in the development of the upper canine\r\nteeth and modifications of the skull which were necessary to enable the\r\nanimal to use these teeth as weapons.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the “sabers” effective it was necessary to get the\r\nlower jaws out of the way, and this was provided for in an unusual type\r\nof hinge which enabled the mouth to open wider than is possible in the\r\ncase of the less specialized carnivores. Judging by all the structural\r\nfeatures of the skeleton, _Smilodon_ could not have lived well on small\r\nanimals, for it was not equipped to capture that kind of prey. It is\r\nevident that large mammals were preferred, and that the method of attack\r\nwas to spring upon the victim and cling there with the powerfully\r\ndeveloped fore limbs until the kill was completed by stabbing into a\r\nvulnerable spot. That the position of the large sabers near the front of\r\nthe mouth interfered with normal feeding, is a reasonable conclusion.\r\nThere are also anatomical features which lead to the belief that this\r\ncarnivore was a blood sucker, perhaps more than it was meat-eater.\r\n\r\nIf most of these conclusions are correct we have here another case of\r\nover-specialization and a possible explanation of the extinction of two\r\nspecies. Such evidence as we have is far from conclusive, for there is\r\nno proof that Rancho La Brea was the last stand of either the\r\nsaber-tooth or the ground-sloth. Both races were widely distributed and\r\ntheir living conditions could not have been exactly duplicated in other\r\nlocalities. It has been suggested, however, that _Smilodon_ ate the last\r\nof _Mylodon_, and starved soon afterward because it had become unable to\r\npartake of other foods. The conjecture is offered for what it is worth,\r\ntogether with the facts on which the story has been based.\r\n\r\nThe geological record for Pleistocene time is not as complete as one\r\nmight imagine. Numerous localities have produced representative fossils\r\nbut the yield is rarely large enough to solve many of the riddles which\r\nare constantly arising as investigation proceeds. Aside from those areas\r\nwhich bordered the retreating ice cap and where living conditions were\r\nfar from favorable, the sedimentary deposits of this period are not\r\ncontinuous over large areas. Many Pleistocene fossils are found in\r\nstream channel beds which are always subject to removal by subsequent\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Early Man in North America\r\n\r\n    There is abundant evidence to indicate that the great elephants of\r\n    Pleistocene time were hunted by primitive Americans whose only\r\n    weapons were darts or spears tipped with points of stone. A skull\r\n    and the lower jaws of several mammoths are shown here.]\r\n\r\nIsolated patches of fossil-bearing sediments frequently record the\r\nmigration of animals in unmistakable terms, but the details of the\r\nwanderings and the conditions encountered in the newly established\r\nhabitats are often left in doubt. To correlate the facts revealed at one\r\nlocality with findings at other places and, if possible, to date all\r\nprehistoric events with a greater degree of accuracy are among the major\r\ntasks of current investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE AGE OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene or “Ice Age,” and the Recent period in which we are\r\nliving at the present moment are not sharply separated by any event\r\nreadily recognized or dated, and the two combined are of very short\r\nduration as compared with other periods more clearly established by the\r\npassing of centuries. Together they comprise the Age of Man as commonly\r\nrecognized, with about a million years representing the Pleistocene\r\nperiod, some ten to twenty thousand years the Recent. When geologists of\r\nthe nineteenth century suggested that the coming of man should be\r\nregarded as the beginning of a new era, the name Psychozoic was\r\nproposed, and to some extent this term has been applied to the present\r\nperiod. More in keeping with other period names is Holocene, meaning\r\n_entirely recent_. Common usage, however, applies the simple term Recent\r\nto this unfinished chapter which is also without a clear-cut beginning.\r\n\r\nZoologically, man is merely one of the creatures that arrived in the\r\ncourse of time, along with other mammals. Just when he arrived and how\r\nhe looked at the time of his coming cannot be determined from a study of\r\nfossils. Perhaps it is of no importance. There is nothing to indicate\r\nhis existence before the Cenozoic, no completely satisfactory proof of\r\nexistence before the Pleistocene period. As with other inhabitants of\r\nthe earth, it is probable that he became prominent only after a great\r\ndeal of competition with other creatures which kept his ancestors\r\nsubmerged for thousands of years. The Ice Age, with its check upon the\r\nprogress of competing animals, undoubtedly gave him an advantage. His\r\nsuperior mentality enabled him to overcome adversity by methods not\r\navailable to other mammals; his inventive and mechanical genius must\r\nhave been greatly strengthened by his experience during this interval.\r\n\r\nAt about this point, where prehistory begins to merge into history, the\r\ngeologist and paleontologist must let other interpreters carry on.\r\nArcheologists and anthropologists take up the work, and through their\r\nefforts many details have been added to our knowledge of the human race.\r\nThe study of biology, which is the science of life, has provided an\r\ninstructive viewpoint that enables us to see ourselves against the vast\r\nbackground built up by investigations into the nature of the earth and\r\nits ancient inhabitants. This science deals with living creatures as\r\n_organisms_—plants and animals so organized as to be capable of\r\nexistence only in an environment which provides exact life requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Age of Man has been variously characterized as an age of soul, of\r\nhigher intelligence, of culture, and finally, of civilization, freedom\r\nand democracy. The “crowning glory” of the organic world is pictured in\r\nhistory as a creature who has busied himself for thousands of years with\r\nthe building up and tearing down of civilizations. Prehistory reveals\r\nthis habit as something unique in the human character, for there is no\r\nother organism that has specialized so persistently in the creation of\r\nits own environment, no other that has had the combined power and talent\r\nto produce so much change.\r\n\r\nMore than anything else, the prehistoric record is a lesson in\r\nadaptation, which in its broadest sense means fitness for life under\r\nparticular conditions, and always subject to organic law. Man’s efforts\r\nto bring about an adjustment between himself and his civilization have\r\ncentered largely on the method of forcing himself into the mold that\r\nhappens to be present, one pattern today, another tomorrow. No creature\r\nof the past has had to adapt itself to anything so radically new or so\r\nthoroughly revolutionary. The vital problem now is whether this man-made\r\nenvironment will prove helpful or disastrous.\r\n\r\nThough one of its names is “culture,” it has grown sporadically and\r\nunevenly, with little evidence of the cultivation that is implied and\r\nrequired. Parts have been expanded to extraordinary proportions while\r\nothers equally essential have been retarded in their growth. A more\r\nintelligent handling of this environment factor seems to be possible,\r\nand the present mania for “organization” may become tempered with an\r\nawakening consciousness of organic requirements where organism and\r\nenvironment are involved. Once we grasp the idea that “culture” results\r\nfrom man’s effort to improve his living, by putting into his environment\r\nsomething that was not there before—then, surely, this history of a\r\nbillion years of living, and as many “ways of life,” should teach us\r\nsomething we ought to know as we go into an all-out endeavor to teach a\r\nwhole world how to obtain a one-and-only way.\r\n\r\nWe may stand at the beginning of an era for which an appropriate name\r\nhas not yet been suggested. Civilization, on the other hand, may provide\r\nonly a minor epoch to be added in some remote time to the story of\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SUPPLEMENTARY READING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe literature pertaining to fossils is widely scattered and usually too\r\ntechnical for the layman. It is better to use the resources of the\r\nnearest library than to feel that a specified list of books is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nAny textbook on geology, zoology, or botany will provide helpful\r\ninformation. Most books of this type will be found interesting and\r\nreadable if used to solve definite problems suggested by the student’s\r\nimmediate curiosity.
