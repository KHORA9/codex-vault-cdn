If a circle a thousand miles in diameter be inscribed\r\non a map of the northern Pacific with a point in about latitude 54°\r\nand longitude 145° as a center, a large part of its northern periphery\r\nwill be found to coincide with the southern shore of Alaska between\r\nDixon entrance on the east and the Alaska peninsula on the west. On\r\nthe northern part of this great coast-circle lies the region explored\r\nin the summer of 1890 and described in the following pages.\r\n\r\nFrom Cross sound, at the northern end of the great system of islands\r\nforming southeastern Alaska, westward along the base of the\r\nFairweather range, the mountains are exceedingly rugged, and present\r\nsome of the finest coast scenery in the world. There are but two\r\ninlets east of Yakutat bay on this shore which afford shelter even for\r\nsmall boats. These are Lituya bay and Dry bay. Ships may enter Lituya\r\nbay, at certain stages of the tide, and find a safe harbor within; but\r\nthe approaches to Dry bay are not navigable. West of Yakutat bay the\r\ncoast is equally inhospitable all the way to Prince William sound.\r\n\r\n{56} As if to compensate for the lack of refuge on either end, there\r\nis in the center of this great stretch of rock-bound coast, over 300\r\nmiles in extent, a magnificent inlet known as Yakutat bay, in which a\r\nthousand ships could find safe anchorage. On some old maps this bay is\r\ndesignated as \"Baie de Monti,\" \"Admiralty bay\" and \"Bering bay,\" as\r\nwill be seen when its discovery and history are discussed on another\r\npage.\r\n\r\nThe southern shore of Alaska, for a distance of 200 miles along the\r\nbases of the Fairweather and St. Elias ranges, is formed of a low\r\ntable-land intervening between the mountains and the sea. Yakutat bay\r\nis the only bight in this plateau sufficiently deep to reach the\r\nmountain to the northward. This bay has a broad opening to the sea;\r\nthe distance between its ocean capes is twenty miles, and its\r\nextension inland is about the same. Its eastern shore is fringed with\r\nlow, wooded islands, among which are sheltered harbors, safe from\r\nevery wind that blows. The most accessible of these is Port Mulgrave,\r\nnear its entrance on the eastern side.\r\n\r\nThe shores of Yakutat bay, on both the east and the west, are low and\r\ndensely wooded for a distance of twenty-five miles from the ocean,\r\nwhere the foot-hills of the mountains begin. At the head of the bay\r\nthe land rises in steep bluffs and forms picturesque mountains,\r\nsnow-capped the year round. These highlands, although truly\r\nmountainous in their proportions, are but the foot-hills of still\r\nnobler uplifts immediately northward. The bay extends through an\r\nopening in the first range to the base of the white peaks beyond. This\r\nopening was examined a century ago by explorers in search of the\r\ndelusive \"Northwest passage,\" in the hope that it would lead to the\r\nlong-sought \"Strait of Annan\"--the dream of many voyagers. It was\r\nsurveyed by the expedition in command of Malaspina in 1792, and on\r\naccount of his frustrated hopes was named \"Puerto del Desengaño,\" or\r\n\"Disenchantment bay,\" as it has been rendered by English writers.\r\n\r\nThe waters of Yakutat and Disenchantment bays are deep, and broken\r\nonly by islands and reefs along their eastern shores. A few soundings\r\nmade in Disenchantment bay within half a mile of the land showed a\r\ndepth of from 40 to 120 fathoms. The swell of the ocean is felt up to\r\nthe very head of the inlet, indicating, as was remarked to me by\r\nCaptain C. L. Hooper, that there are no bars or reefs to break the\r\nforce of the incoming swells.\r\n\r\n{57} The lowlands bordering Yakutat bay on the southeast are composed\r\nof assorted glacial débris. Much of the country is low and swampy, and\r\nis reported to contain numerous lakelets. Northwest of the bay the\r\nplateau is higher than toward the southeast, and has a general\r\nelevation of about 500 feet at a distance of a mile from the shore;\r\nbut the height increases toward the interior, where a general\r\nelevation of 1,500 feet is attained over large areas. All of this\r\nplateau, excepting a narrow fringe along the shore, is formed by a\r\ngreat glacier, belonging to what is termed in this paper the\r\n_Piedmont_ type. There are many reasons for believing that the plateau\r\nsoutheast of Yakutat bay was at one time covered by a glacier similar\r\nto the one now existing on the northwest.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This matter will be discussed in part IV of this paper,\r\nwhere it is also shown that Yakutat bay itself was formerly occupied\r\nby glacial ice.]\r\n\r\nThe mountains on the northern border of the seaward-stretching\r\ntable-lands, both southeast and northwest of Yakutat bay, are abrupt\r\nand present steep southward-facing bluffs. This escarpment is formed\r\nof stratified sandstones and shales, and owes its origin to the\r\nupheaval of the rocks along a line of fracture. In other words, it is\r\na gigantic fault scarp. The gravel and bowlders forming the plateau\r\nextending oceanward have been accumulating on a depressed orographic\r\nblock (or mass of strata moved as a unit by mountain-making forces),\r\nwhich has undergone some movement in very recent times, as is recorded\r\nby a terrace on the fault scarp bordering it. West of Yakutat the\r\ngeological structure is more complex, and long mountain spurs project\r\ninto the platform of ice skirting the ocean. Filling the valleys\r\nbetween the mountain spurs, there are many large seaward-flowing\r\nglaciers, tributary to the great Piedmont ice-sheet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis brief sketch of the geography of Yakutat bay, together with the\r\naccompanying outline map of Alaska (plate 2), will, it is hoped, aid\r\nin making intelligible the following historical sketch and the\r\nnarrative of the present expedition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 2. SKETCH MAP OF ALASKA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{58}\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nPREVIOUS EXPLORATIONS IN THE ST. ELIAS REGION.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For more complete bibliographic references than space\r\nwill allow in this paper, the reader is referred to Dall and Baker's\r\n\"Partial list of books, pamphlets, papers in serials, journals and\r\nother publications on Alaska and adjacent regions;\" in Pacific Coast\r\nPilot: Coasts and Inlets of Alaska; second series. U. S. Coast and\r\nGeodetic Survey, Washington, 1879; 4°, pp. 225-375.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBERING, 1741.\r\n\r\nThe first discovery of the southern coast of Alaska was made by Vitus\r\nBering and Alexei Cherikof, in the vessels _St. Peter_ and _St. Paul_,\r\nin 1741. On July 20 of that year, Bering saw the mountains of the\r\nmainland, but anchored his vessels at Kyak island, 180 miles west of\r\nYakutat bay, without touching the continental shore. A towering,\r\nsnow-clad summit northeast of Kyak island was named \"Mount St. Elias,\"\r\nafter the patron saint of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOK, 1778.\r\n\r\nThe next explorer to visit this portion of Alaska was Captain James\r\nCook, who sailed past the entrance of Yakutat bay on May 4, 1778.\r\nThinking that this was the bay in which Bering anchored, he named it\r\n\"Bering's bay.\" Mount St. Elias was seen in the northwest at a\r\ndistance of 40 leagues, but no attempt was made to measure its height.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA PÉROUSE, 1786.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Voyage de la Pérouse autour du monde. Four vols., 4°, and\r\natlas; Paris, 1797; vol. 2, pp. 130-150.]\r\n\r\nYakutat bay, in which we are specially interested, was next seen by\r\nthe celebrated French navigator, J. F. G. de la Pérouse, in command of\r\nthe frigates _La Boussole_ and _L'Astrolabe_, on June 23, 1786.\r\n\r\nThe chart showing the route followed by La Pérouse during this portion\r\nof his voyage is reproduced in plate 3. In the splendid atlas\r\naccompanying the narrative of his travels, the explorer pictures the\r\nquaint, high-pooped vessels in which he {59} circumnavigated the\r\nglobe. These French frigates were the first to cruise off Yakutat bay.\r\nThe last vessel to navigate those waters was the United States revenue\r\nsteamer _Corwin_, which took our little exploring party on board in\r\nSeptember, 1890, and then steamed northward to the ice-cliffs at the\r\nhead of Disenchantment bay. So far as I am aware, the _Corwin_ is the\r\nonly vessel that has floated on the waters of that inlet north of\r\nHaenke island. One hundred years has made a revolution in naval\r\narchitecture, but has left this portion of the Alaska coast still\r\nunexplored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 3. MAP OF THE ST. ELIAS REGION, AFTER LA\r\nPÉROUSE.]\r\n\r\nLa Pérouse sailed northward from the Sandwich islands, and first saw\r\nland, which proved to be a portion of the St. Elias range, on June 23.\r\nAt first the shore was obscured by fog, which, as stated in the\r\nnarrative of the voyage, \"suddenly disappearing, all at once disclosed\r\nto us a long chain of mountains covered with snow, which, if the\r\nweather had been clear, we would have been able to have seen thirty\r\nleagues farther off. We discovered Bering's Mount Saint Elias, the\r\nsummit of which appeared above the clouds.\"\r\n\r\nThe first view of the land is described as not awakening the feelings\r\nof joy which usually accompany the first view of an unknown shore\r\nafter a long voyage. To quote the navigator's own words:\r\n\r\n\"Those immense heaps of snow, which covered a barren land without\r\ntrees, were far from agreeable to our view. The mountains appeared a\r\nlittle remote from the sea, which broke against a bold and level land,\r\nelevated about a hundred and fifty or two hundred fathoms. This black\r\nrock, which appeared as if calcined by fire, destitute of all verdure,\r\nformed a striking contrast to the whiteness of the snow, which was\r\nperceptible through the clouds; it served as the base to a long ridge\r\nof mountains, which appeared to stretch fifteen leagues from east to\r\nwest. At first we thought ourselves very near it, the summit of the\r\nmountains appeared to be just over our heads, and the snow cast forth\r\na brightness calculated to deceive eyes not accustomed to it; but in\r\nproportion as we advanced we perceived in front of the high ground\r\nhillocks covered with trees, which we took for islands.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some delay, on account of foggy weather, an officer was\r\ndespatched to the newly discovered land; but on returning he reported\r\nthat there was no suitable anchorage to be found. It is difficult at\r\nthis time to understand the reason for this adverse report, unless a\r\nlanding was attempted on the western side of Yakutat bay, where there\r\nare no harbors.\r\n\r\n{60} The name \"Baie de Monti\" was given to the inlet in honor of De\r\nMonti, the officer who first landed. The location of this bay, as\r\ndescribed in the narrative and indicated on the map accompanying the\r\nreport of the voyage, shows that it corresponds with the Yakutat bay\r\nof modern maps.\r\n\r\nObservations made at this time by M. Dagelet, the astronomer of the\r\nexpedition, determined the elevation of Mount St. Elias to be 1,980\r\ntoises. Considering the toise as equivalent to 6.39459 English feet,\r\nthis measurement places the elevation of the mountain at 12,660 feet.\r\nWhat method was used in making this measurement is not recorded, and\r\nwe have therefore no means of deciding the degree of confidence to be\r\nplaced in it.\r\n\r\nAfter failing to find an anchorage at Yakutat bay. La Pérouse sailed\r\neastward, and on June 29 discovered another bay, which he supposed to\r\nbe the inlet named \"Bering's bay\" by Captain Cook. It will be\r\nremembered that Cook's \"Bering's bay\" is Yakutat bay as now known. It\r\nis evident that the French navigator made an error in his\r\nidentification, as the inlet designated as Bering's bay on his chart\r\ncorresponds with that now known as Dry bay. On the maps referred to, a\r\nstream is represented as emptying into the head of this bay and rising\r\na long distance northward; this is evidently Alsek river, the\r\nexistence of which was for a long time doubted, but has recently been\r\nestablished beyond all question.\r\n\r\nFinding it impossible to enter Dry bay, La Pérouse continued eastward\r\nand discovered Lituya bay, as now known, but which he named \"Port des\r\nFrancais.\" Here his ships anchored, after experiencing great\r\ndifficulty in entering the harbor, and remained for many days, during\r\nwhich trade was carried on with the Indians, while surveys were made\r\nof the adjacent shores.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIXON, 1787.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The Voyage around the World; but more particularly to the\r\nNorthwest Coast of America. Performed in 1788-1789, in the _King\r\nGeorge_ and _Queen Charlotte_; Captains Portlock and Dixon: 4°,\r\nLondon, 1789.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the actual discovery of Yakutat bay is to be credited to the\r\nFrench, the first exploration of its shores was made by an English\r\ncaptain. On May 23, 1787, Captain George Dixon anchored his vessel,\r\nthe _Queen Charlotte_, within the shelter of its southeastern cape,\r\nand, in honor of Constance John Phipps, Lord Mulgrave, named the haven\r\nthere discovered \"Port {61} Mulgrave.\" The harbor is described in the\r\nnarrative of Dixon's voyage as being \"entirely surrounded by low, flat\r\nislands, where scarcely any snow could be seen, and well sheltered\r\nfrom any winds whatever.\"\r\n\r\nThe voyage of the _Queen Charlotte_ was not made for the purpose of\r\nincreasing geographic knowledge, but with a commercial object. Trade\r\nwas at once opened with the natives, but resulted less favorably than\r\nwas desired, as only sixteen sea-otter skins and a few less valuable\r\nfurs were secured.\r\n\r\nOn the chart accompanying the narrative of Dixon's voyage the inlet\r\nnow known as Yakutat bay is named \"Admiralty bay.\"\r\n\r\nA survey of the adjacent shores and inlets was made, and the\r\nastronomical position of the anchorage was approximately determined.\r\nThe map resulting from these surveys, the first ever made of any\r\nportion of Yakutat bay, is reproduced on a reduced scale as plate 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 4. MAP OF THE EASTERN SHORE OF YAKUTAT BAY, AFTER\r\nDIXON.]\r\n\r\nAt the time of Dixon's voyage, the inhabitants numbered about seventy,\r\nincluding men, women, and children, and were thus described:\r\n\r\n\"They are of about middle size, their limbs straight and well shaped,\r\nbut, like the rest of the inhabitants we have seen on the coast, are\r\nparticularly fond of painting their faces with a variety of colors, so\r\nthat it is not any easy matter to discover their real complexion.\"\r\n\r\nAn amusing instance is narrated of inducing a woman to wash her face,\r\nwhen it was discovered that--\r\n\r\n\"Her countenance had all the cheerful glow of an English milk maid,\r\nand the healthy red which flushed her cheeks was even _beautifully_\r\ncontrasted with the whiteness of her neck; her eyes were black and\r\nsparkling; her eyebrows the same color, and most beautifully arched;\r\nher forehead so remarkably clear that the transparent veins were seen\r\nmeandering even in their minutest branches--in short, she was what\r\nwould be reckoned as handsome even in England. The symmetry of her\r\nfeatures, however, was marred, at least in the eyes of her English\r\nadmirer, by the habit of wearing a labret in the slit of her lower\r\nlip.\"\r\n\r\nDuring our recent visit to Port Mulgrave we did not find the native\r\nwomen answering to the glowing description of the voyager who\r\ndiscovered the harbor; but this may be owing to the fact that we did\r\nnot prevail upon any of them to wash their faces.\r\n\r\nOne other discrepancy must be noted between the records of Dixon's\r\nvoyage and my own observations, made one hundred {62} years later. The\r\nhouses of the natives are described in the narrative just cited as--\r\n\r\n\"The most wretched hovels that can possibly be conceived: a few poles\r\nstuck in the ground, without order or regularity, recrossed and\r\ncovered with loose boards, ... quite insufficient to keep out the snow\r\nand rain.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this description would apply to the temporary shelters now used\r\nby the Yakutat Indians when on their summer hunting and fishing\r\nexpeditions, it by no means describes the houses in which they pass\r\nthe winter. These are large and substantially built of planks hewn\r\nfrom spruce trees, and in some instances supported from the inside by\r\nfour huge posts, carved and painted to represent grotesque figures. In\r\nthe center of the roof there is a large opening through which the\r\nsmoke escapes from the fire kindled in an open space in the floor. But\r\nfew of the Indian villages of Alaska, excepting perhaps the homes of\r\nthe Thlinkets in the Alexandrian archipelago, are better built or more\r\ncomfortable than those at Port Mulgrave.\r\n\r\nOn the map of Port Mulgrave already referred to, \"Point Turner\" and\r\n\"Point Carrew\" appear. The former was named for the second mate of the\r\n_Queen Charlotte_, who was the first of her officers to land; the\r\nsecond name was probably designed to honor another officer of the\r\nexpedition, but of this I am not positive.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS, 1788.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Voyage of the _Iphigenia_; Captain Douglas: in Voyages\r\nmade in the years 1788-1789 from China to the Northwest Coast of\r\nAmerica. John Meares, 4°, London, 1790.]\r\n\r\nIn 1788, another trading vessel, the ship _Iphigenia_, in command of\r\nCaptain Douglas, visited the southern shore of Alaska and anchored in\r\nYakutat bay; but no special account of the country or the inhabitants\r\nis recorded in the narrative of the voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALASPINA, 1792.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Relacion del viage hecho por las goletas Sutil y Mexicana\r\nen el año de 1792 para reconocer el estrecho de Fuca; con una\r\nintroduccion en que se da noticia de las expediciones executadas\r\nanteriormente por los Españoles en busca del paso del noroeste de la\r\nAmérica [Por Don Dionisio Alcala Galiano]. Madrid, 1802 [accompanied\r\nby an atlas]. Pp. CXII-CXXI.]\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred years ago the interest felt by the maritime nations of\r\nEurope in a \"Northwest passage,\" connecting the {63} northern Atlantic\r\nwith the northern Pacific, was revived by the renewal of the\r\ndiscussion as to the authenticity of Maldonado's reported discovery of\r\nthe \"Strait of Annan.\" The western entrance to this strait was\r\nsupposed to be about in the position of Yakutat bay. Spain, in\r\nparticular, after three hundred years of exploration and discovery in\r\nall parts of the world, was still anxious to extend her conquests,\r\nand, if possible, to discover the long-sought \"Northwest passage.\" Two\r\nof her ships, the _Descubierta_ and _Atrevida_, were then at Acapulco,\r\nin command of Don Alejandro Malaspina, who was engaged in a voyage of\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nMalaspina, like Columbus, was a native of Italy in the service of\r\nSpain. Orders were sent to him to cruise northward and test the truth\r\nof Maldonado's report. The narrative of this voyage is supposed to\r\nhave been written by Don Dionisio Alcala Galiano, but his name does\r\nnot appear on the title page. Still more curious is the fact that\r\nMalaspina's name is omitted from the narrative of his own voyage. On\r\nhis return to Spain, he was thrown into prison, on account of court\r\nintrigues, and his discoveries were suppressed for many years.\r\n\r\nMalaspina left Acapulco on the first of May, 1791, and reached the\r\nvicinity of the present site of Sitka on June 25. Two days later,\r\nMount Fairweather, or \"Monte Buen-tiempo,\" as it is designated on\r\nSpanish maps, was sighted. Continuing northwestward, the entrance to\r\nYakutat bay was reached. The opening through the first range of\r\nmountains at its head seemed to correspond to Maldonado's description\r\nof the entrance to the mythical \"Strait of Annan.\"\r\n\r\nThe eastern shore of Yakutat bay, called \"Almiralty bay\" on the\r\nSpanish chart, was explored, and an excursion was made in boats into\r\nDisenchantment bay as far as Haenke island. \"Disenchantment bay,\" as\r\nthe name appears on modern charts, was named \"Desengaño bay\" by\r\nMalaspina, as previously stated, in allusion to the frustration of his\r\nhopes on not finding a passage leading to the Atlantic. Explorations\r\nin Disenchantment bay were checked by ice, which descended from the\r\nnorth and filled all of the inlets north of Haenke island. This is\r\nindicated on the map forming plate 7 (page 67), which is reproduced\r\nfrom the atlas accompanying the narrative of Malaspina's voyage.\r\nSpecial interest attaches to this map for the reason that by comparing\r\nit with that forming plate 8 (page 75), made 100 years later, the\r\nretreat {64} of the glaciers during that interval can be\r\ndetermined.[7] At the time of Malaspina's expedition, the Hubbard and\r\nDalton glaciers were united, and were probably also joined by some of\r\nthe neighboring glaciers which do not now reach tide-water; the whole\r\nforming a confluent ice stream which occupied all of Disenchantment\r\nbay northeast of Haenke island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: It must be remembered, however, that the map, plate 8, is\r\nnot from detailed surveys; the portion referred to was sketched from a\r\nfew stations only and is much generalized.]\r\n\r\nA portion of the general map of the coast of southern Alaska, showing\r\nthe route followed by the _Descubierta_ and the _Atrevida_, and\r\ndepicting the topography of the adjacent shores, has been reproduced\r\nin plate 5. It will be noticed that on this map Lituya bay is called\r\n\"Pt. des Francais,\" while Dry bay is designated as \"Bering's bay.\"\r\nThese and other names were adopted from the maps of La Pérouse. A map\r\nof \"Bahia de Monti,\" from Malaspina's report, is reproduced in plate\r\n6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 5. MAP OF THE ST. ELIAS REGION, AFTER MALASPINA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 6. MAP OF BAY DE MONTI, AFTER MALASPINA.]\r\n\r\nAn extract from Galiano's account of Malaspina's discoveries in\r\nYakutat and Disenchantment bays,[8] translated by Robert Stein, of the\r\nU. S. Geological Survey, is here inserted, in order that the reader\r\nmay be able to form an independent judgment of the value of the\r\nevidence just referred to as bearing on the retreat of the glaciers:\r\n\r\n\"An observatory was established on shore, and some absolute altitudes\r\nwere taken in order to furnish a basis for the reckoning of the\r\nwatches; but the great concourse of Indians, their importunity and\r\nthievishness, made it necessary to transfer all the instruments on\r\nboard. Still the latitude was determined, the watches were regulated,\r\nthe number of oscillations made by the simple pendulum was observed,\r\nand the height of Mount St. Elias was measured, being 6,507.6 varas\r\n[17,847 feet] above sea-level. The launches being ready, put to sea on\r\nJuly 2 with the commander of the expedition, in order to reconnoitre\r\nthe channel promised by the opening, similar to that depicted by\r\nFerrer Maldonado in his voyage; but the small force of the tide\r\nnoticed at the entrance, and the indications of the natives, made it\r\nplain not only that the desired passage did not exist there, but that\r\nthe extent of the channel was very short; which was also rendered\r\nevident by the perpetual frost covering the inner west shore. The\r\nlaunches anchored there, having penetrated into the channel with great\r\ndifficulty, the oars being clogged by the floating masses of snow;\r\nthey measured a base, made some marks, gathered various objects and\r\nstones for the naturalists, and, having reached the line of perpetual\r\nfrost, {65} returned to the bay where they had anchored.[9] They there\r\nobserved the latitude to be 59° 59' 30\", and six azimuths of the sun,\r\nwhich gave the variation of the needle as 32° 49'. Before leaving that\r\nanchorage the commander buried a bottle with record of the\r\nreconnoissance and possession taken in the name of the king. They\r\ncalled the harbor Desangaño, the opening Bahia de las Bancas, and the\r\nisland in the interior Haenke, in memory of D. Tadeo Haenke, botanist\r\nand naturalist of the expedition. On the third day they set out on\r\ntheir voyage to Mulgrave, where they arrived on the 6th, after\r\nreconnoitering various channels and islands north of that port and\r\nmapping them.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Ibid., pp. XCIV-CXVI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: On the coast of the mainland east of Knight island.--I.\r\nC. R.]\r\n\r\nFollowing the portion of the narrative above quoted, there is an\r\naccount of the natives, containing much information of interest to\r\nethnologists, but which it is not necessary to follow in a geographic\r\nreport. On July 5 the corvettes sailed westward, and made a\r\nreconnoissance as far as Montegue island. Returning eastward, they\r\nagain sighted Mount St. Elias on July 22.\r\n\r\n\"On the 28th they were three leagues west of the capes which terminate\r\nin Bering bay [Dry bay]; the mountain of that name being about five\r\nleagues distant from the coast and rising 5,368.3 varas [14,722 feet]\r\nabove the sea-level, and in latitude 59° 0' 42\" and longitude 2° 4'\r\nfrom Port Mulgrave.\"\r\n\r\nMount Bering does not appear on any map that I have seen. Which of the\r\nnumerous high peaks in the vicinity of Dry bay should be designated by\r\nthat name remains to be determined.\r\n\r\nIn a record of the astronomical work of Malaspina's expedition[10]\r\nthere are some interesting observations on the position and elevation\r\nof Mount St. Elias, a translation of which, by Mr. Stein, is here\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n\"True longitude of Mulgrave west of Cadiz, 133° 24' 12\". On the same\r\nday, the 30th of June [1792], at the observatory of Mulgrave, at 6h.\r\n30' in the morning, the true altitude of the sun was observed to be\r\n16° 14' 20\", and its inclination being 23° 11' 30\" and the latitude\r\n59° 34' 20\", the true azimuth of the sun from north to east was\r\nconcluded to be 71° 43' 0\". But having measured on the same occasion\r\nwith the theodolite 110° 33' from the sun's vertical to the vertical\r\nof Mount St. Elias, the difference between these two quantities is the\r\nastronomic azimuth. Hence, from {66} the observatory of Mulgrave, said\r\nmountain bears N. 38° 50' W., a distance of 55.1 miles, deduced by\r\nmeans of good observations from the ends of a sufficient base. A\r\nquadrant was used to measure the angle of apparent altitude of the\r\nmountain, 2° 38' 6\", and allowing for terrestrial refraction, which is\r\none-tenth of the distance of 55.1 miles, the true altitude was found\r\nto be 2° 34' 39\"; whence its elevation above sea-level was concluded\r\nto be 2,793 toises [17,860 feet], and the length of the tangent to the\r\nhorizon, 152 miles, allowance being made for the increase due to\r\nterrestrial refraction....\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, with the rhumb, or astronomic azimuth, and the distance from\r\nthe observatory of Mulgrave to Mount St. Elias, it was ascertained\r\nthat that mountain was 43' 15\" to the north and 1° 9' to the west,\r\nwhence its latitude is found to be 60° 17' 35\" and its longitude 134°\r\n33' 10\" west of Cadiz.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Memorias sobre las observaciones astronomicas hechas por\r\nles navegantes Españoles en distintos lugares del globe; Por Don Josef\r\nEspinosa y Tello.

(San Sebastian\r\nlight-house), the longitude of St. Elias from this determination would\r\nbe 140° 52' 17\" W.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANCOUVER, 1794.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: A Voyage of Discovery to the Northern Pacific Ocean and\r\naround the World, 1790-'95; new edition, 6 vols., London, 1801. The\r\ncitations which follow are from vol. 5, pp. 348-407.]\r\n\r\nThe next vessels to visit Yakutat bay after Malaspina's voyage, so far\r\nas known, were the _Discovery_ and _Chatham_, under command of Captain\r\nGeorge Vancouver. This voyage increased knowledge of the geography of\r\nsouthern Alaska more than any that preceded it, and was also of\r\ngreater importance than any single expedition of later date to that\r\nregion. The best maps of southern Alaska published at the present day\r\nare based largely on the surveys of Vancouver.\r\n\r\nThe _Discovery_, under the immediate command of Vancouver, and the\r\n_Chatham_, in charge of Peter Puget, cruised eastward along the\r\nsouthern coast of Alaska in 1794. The _Discovery_ passed the entrance\r\nto Yakutat bay without stopping, but the _Chatham_ anchored there, and\r\nimportant surveys were carried on under Puget's directions.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, the _Discovery_ was in the vicinity of Icy bay, where the\r\nshore of the ocean seemed to be composed of solid ice. Eastward from\r\nIcy bay the coast is described as \"bordered by lowlands rising with a\r\ngradual and uniform ascent to the foot-hills of lofty mountains, whose\r\nsummits are but the base from which Mount St. Elias towers\r\nmagnificently into the regions of {67} perpetual frost.\" A low\r\nprojecting point on the western side of the entrance to Yakutat bay\r\nwas named \"Point Manby.\" The coast beyond this toward the northeast\r\nbecame less wooded, and seemed to produce only a brownish vegetation,\r\nwhich farther eastward entirely disappeared. The country was then bare\r\nand composed of loose stones. The narrative contains an interesting\r\naccount of the grand coast scenery from St. Elias to the eastern end\r\nof the Fairweather range; but this does not at present claim\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nWhile the _Chatham_ continued her cruise eastward, Puget ascended\r\nYakutat bay nearly to its head, and also navigated some of the\r\nchannels between the islands along its eastern shore. A cape on the\r\neastern side, where the bay penetrates the first range of foot-hills,\r\nwas named \"Point Latouche;\" but the same landmark had previously been\r\ndesignated \"Pa. de la Esperanza\" by Malaspina. The bay at the head of\r\nthe inlet, which Malaspina had named \"Desangaño,\" was named \"Digges\r\nsound,\" after one of the officers of the _Chatham_. Boats were sent to\r\nexplore this inlet, but found it \"closed from side to side by a firm,\r\ncompact body of ice, beyond which, to the back of the ice, a small\r\ninlet appeared to extend N. 55° E. about a league.\"[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Vancouver's Voyage, vol. 5, p. 389.]\r\n\r\nThese observations confirm those made by Malaspina and indicated on\r\nthe chart reproduced on plate 7, where the ice front is represented as\r\nreaching as far south as Haenke island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 7. MAP OF DISENCHANTMENT BAY, AFTER MALASPINA.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence furnished by Malaspina and Vancouver as to the former\r\nextent of the glaciers at the head of Yakutat bay is in harmony with\r\nobservations made by Vancouver's party in Icy strait and Cross\r\nsound.[13] Early in July, 1794, these straits were found to be heavily\r\nencumbered with floating ice. At the present time but little ice is\r\nmet with in that region. On Vancouver's charts there is no indication\r\nthat he was aware of the existence of Glacier bay, although one of his\r\nofficers, in navigating Icy strait, passed its immediate entrance.\r\nThese records, although somewhat indefinite and of negative character,\r\nindicate that the fields of floating ice at the mouth of Glacier bay\r\nwere much more extensive a hundred years ago than at present; but they\r\ndo not show where the glaciers of that region formerly terminated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Ibid., pp. 417-421.]\r\n\r\nAfter the return of the _Chatham's_ boats from the exploration of {68}\r\nDisenchantment bay, an exploration of the eastern shore of Yakutat bay\r\nwas made. The following extract indicates the character of work done\r\nthere:\r\n\r\n\"Digges' sound [Disenchantment bay] was the only place in the bay that\r\npresented the least prospect of any interior navigation, and this was\r\nnecessarily very limited by the close connected range of lofty snowy\r\nmountains that stretched along the coast at no great distance from the\r\nseaside. Mr. Puget's attention was next directed to the opening in the\r\nlow land, but as the wind was variable and adverse to the progress of\r\nthe vessel, a boat was again despatched to continue the investigation\r\nof these shores, which are compact from Point Latouche and were then\r\nfree from ice. This opening was found to be formed by an island about\r\ntwo miles long, in a direction S. 50° E. and N. 50° W., and about a\r\nmile broad, lying at the distance of about half a mile from the\r\nmainland. Opposite to the south part of this, named by Mr. Puget\r\nKNIGHT'S ISLAND, is Eleanor's cove, which is the eastern extremity of\r\nBeering's [Yakutat] bay, in latitude 59° 44', longitude 220° 51'.\r\nKnight's island admits of a navigable passage all round it, but there\r\nis an islet situated between it and the mainland on its northeast\r\nside. From Eleanor's cove the coast takes a direction S. 30° W. about\r\nsix miles to the east point of a channel leading to the southwest\r\nbetween the continent and some islands that lie off it. This was\r\nconsidered to lead along the shores of the mainland to Point Mulgrave,\r\nand in the event of its proving navigable, the examination of the bay\r\nwould have been complete, and the vessel brought to our appointed\r\nplace of meeting, which was now supposed to be no very great\r\ndistance.\"\r\n\r\nIn endeavoring to reach Port Mulgrave by a channel leading between the\r\nislands on the eastern side of the bay and the mainland, the _Chatham_\r\ngrounded, and was gotten off with considerable difficulty. Many\r\nobservations concerning the geography and the natives are recorded in\r\nthe narrative of this exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELCHER, 1837.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Narrative of a Voyage round the World, performed in the\r\nship _Sulphur_ during the years 1836-1842; by Captain Sir Edward\r\nBelcher: 2 vols., 8°, London, 1843.]\r\n\r\nThe next account[15] of explorations around Yakutat bay that {69} has\r\ncome to hand is by Sir Edward Belcher, who visited that coast in Her\r\nMajesty's ship _Sulphur_ in 1837.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: A fort was built by the Russians, in 1795, on the strip\r\nof land separating Bay de Monti from the ocean, and was colonized by\r\nconvicts from Russia. In 1803, all of the settlers were killed and the\r\nfort was destroyed by the Yakutat Indians. So complete was this\r\nmassacre that no detailed account of it has ever appeared. (Alaska and\r\nits Resources, by W. H. Dall, 1870, pp. 316, 317, 323.)]\r\n\r\nIn the narrative of this voyage, a brief account is given of the ice\r\ncliffs at Icy bay, which are stated to have a height of about thirty\r\nfeet and to present the appearance of veined marble. Where the ice was\r\nexposed to the sea it was excavated into alcoves and archways,\r\nrecalling to the narrator's mind the Chalk cliffs of England. \"Point\r\nRiou,\" as named by Vancouver, was not recognized, and the inference\r\nseems to be that it was formed of ice and was dissolved away between\r\nthe visits of Vancouver and Belcher.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the narrative of Belcher's voyage is an illustration\r\nshowing Mount St. Elias as it appears from the sea near Icy bay, which\r\nrepresents the mountain more accurately than some similar pictures\r\npublished more recently.\r\n\r\nThe _Sulphur_ anchored in Port Mulgrave; but no account is given of\r\nthe character of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEBENKOF, 1852.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Atlas of the Northwest Coast of America from Bering\r\nstrait to Cape Corrientes and the Aleutian Islands [etc.]: 2°, St.\r\nPetersburg, 1852. With index and hydrographic observations: 8°, St.\r\nPetersburg, 1852.]\r\n\r\nTebenkof's notes, which are often referred to by writers on Alaska,\r\nconsist principally of compilations from reports of Russian traders,\r\nwhich were intended to accompany and explain an atlas of the shores of\r\nnorthwestern America, published in 1852 in St. Petersburg and in\r\nSitka.\r\n\r\nMap number 7 of the atlas represents the southern coast of Alaska from\r\nLituya bay westward to Icy bay. On the same sheet there is a more\r\ndetailed chart of the islands along the eastern border of Yakutat bay.\r\n\r\nThe height of St. Elias is given as 17,000 feet; its position,\r\nlatitude 61° 2' 6\" and longitude 140° 4', distant 30 miles from the\r\nsea.[17] It is stated that in 1839 the mountain \"began at times to\r\nsmoke through a crater on its southeastern slope.\" At the time of an\r\nearthquake at Sitka (1847) it is said to have emitted flames and\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: In a foot-note on page 33 it is stated that Captain\r\nVasilef, in the ship _Otkrytie_ (_Discovery_), ascertained the height\r\nof Mount Fairweather to be 13,946 feet.]\r\n\r\n{70} It will be seen from the account of the exploration carried on\r\nlast summer that Mount St. Elias is composed of stratified rocks, with\r\nno indication of volcanic origin; and these reports of eruption must\r\nconsequently be considered erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe low country between Mount St. Elias and the sea is described by\r\nTebenkof as a tundra covered with forests and grass; \"through cracks\r\nin the gravelly soil, ice could be seen beneath.\" More recent\r\nknowledge shows that this statement also is erroneous. The adjacent\r\nocean is stated to be shallow, with shelving bottom; at a distance of\r\nhalf a verst, five to twelve fathoms were obtained, and at two miles\r\nfrom land, thirty to forty fathoms (of seven feet).\r\n\r\nThe Pimpluna rocks are said to have been discovered in 1779 by the\r\nSpanish captain Arteiga. They were also seen in 1794 by the helmsman\r\nTalin, in the ship _Orel_, and named after his vessel. These\r\nobservations are interesting, and indicate that possibly there may be\r\nsubmerged moraines in the region where these rocks are reported to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nMany other observations are recorded concerning the mountains and the\r\nbays in the vicinity of Yakutat. While of interest to navigation and\r\nto geographers, these have no immediate connection with the region\r\nexplored during the recent expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, 1874,[18] 1880.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Appendix No. 10, Report of the Superintendent of the\r\nU.

They were\r\nconducted by W. H. Dall and Marcus Baker. Besides the survey of the\r\ncoast-line, determinations were made of the heights and positions of\r\nseveral mountain peaks between Glacier bay and Cook inlet. Dall's\r\naccount of this survey contains a brief sketch of previous\r\nexplorations and a summary of the measurements of the higher peaks of\r\nthe region. This material has been used on another page in discussing\r\nthe height of Mount St. Elias.\r\n\r\nBesides the geographic data gathered by the United States Coast\r\nSurvey, many observations were made on geology and on the glaciers of\r\nthe region about Yakutat bay and Mount St. Elias. Exception must be\r\ntaken, in the light of more recent {71} explorations, to some of the\r\nconclusions reached in this connection, as will appear in the chapter\r\ndevoted to geology and glaciers.\r\n\r\nA description of the St. Elias region in the Pacific Coast Pilot\r\nsupplements the paper in the coast survey report for 1875. This is an\r\nexhaustive compilation from all available sources of information\r\ninteresting to navigators. It contains, besides, a valuable summary of\r\nwhat was known at the time of its publication concerning the history\r\nand physical features of the country to which it relates. In this\r\npublication the true character of the Malaspina glacier was first\r\nrecorded and its name proposed. The description is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"At Point Manby and eastward to the Kwik river the shore was bordered\r\nby trees, apparently willows and alders, with a somewhat denser belt a\r\nlittle farther back. Behind this rises a bluff or bank of high land,\r\nas described by various navigators. About the vicinity of Tebienkoff's\r\nNearer Point the trees cease, but begin again near the river. The\r\nbluff or table-land behind rises higher than the river valley and\r\ncompletely hides it from the southward, and is in summer bare of\r\nvegetation (except a few rare patches on its face) and apparently is\r\ncomposed of glacial débris, much of which is of a reddish color. In\r\nMay, 1874, when observed by the U. S. Coast Survey party of that year,\r\nthe extensive flattened top of this table-land or plateau was covered\r\nwith a smooth and even sheet of pure white snow. In the latter part of\r\nJune, 1880, however, this snow had melted, and for the first time the\r\nreal and most extraordinary character of this plateau was revealed.\r\nWithin the beach and extending in a northwesterly direction to the\r\nvalley behind it, at the foot of the St. Elias Alps an undetermined\r\ndistance, this plateau, or a large part of it, is one great field of\r\nburied ice. Almost everywhere nothing is visible but bowlders, dirt\r\nand gravel; but at the time mentioned, back of the bight between Point\r\nManby and Nearer Point, for a space of several square miles the\r\ncoverlid of dirt had fallen in, owing to the melting of the ice\r\nbeneath, and revealed a surface of broken pinnacles of ice, each\r\ncrowned by a patch of dirt, standing close to one another like a\r\nforest of prisms, these decreasing in height from the summit of the\r\nplateau gradually in a sort of semicircular sweep toward the beach,\r\nnear which, however, the dirt and débris again predominate, forming a\r\nsort of terminal moraine to this immense, buried, immovable glacier,\r\nfor it is nothing else. Trains of large bowlders were visible here and\r\nthere, and the general trend of the glacier seemed to be northwest and\r\nsoutheast.\r\n\r\n\"Between Disenchantment bay and the foot of Mount St. Elias, on the\r\nflanks of the Alps, seventeen glaciers were counted, of which about\r\nten were behind this plateau, but none are of very large size, and the\r\nsum total of them all seemed far too little to supply the waste of the\r\nplateau if it were to possess motion. The lower ends of these small\r\nglaciers come {72} down into the river valley before mentioned and at\r\nright angles in general to the trend of the plateau. To the buried\r\nglacier the U. S. Coast Survey has applied the name of Malaspina, in\r\nhonor of that distinguished and unfortunate explorer. No connection\r\ncould be seen between the small glaciers and the Malaspina plateau, as\r\nthe former dip below the level of the summit of the latter. The\r\nMalaspina had no névé, nor was there any high land in the direction of\r\nits axis as far as the eye could reach. Everywhere, except where the\r\npinnacles protruded and in a few spots on the face of the bluff, it\r\nwas covered with a thick stratum of soil, gravel and stones, here and\r\nthere showing small patches of bright green herbage. The bluff\r\nwestward from Point Manby may probably prove of the same character.\"\r\n\r\nMount Cook and Mount Vancouver are named in the Pacific Coast Pilot,\r\nand their elevations and positions are definitely stated. Mount\r\nMalaspina was also named, but its position is not given. During the\r\nexpedition of last summer it was found impracticable to decide\r\ndefinitely to which peak the name of the great navigator was applied.\r\nSo existing nomenclature was followed as nearly as possible by\r\nattaching Malaspina's name to a peak about eleven miles east of Mount\r\nSt. Elias. Its position is indicated on the accompanying map, plate 8\r\n(page 75).\r\n\r\nSeveral charts of the southern coast of Alaska accompany the reports\r\nof the United States Coast Survey for 1875, referred to above. A part\r\nof these have been independently published. These charts were used in\r\nmapping the coast-line as it appears on plate 8, and were frequently\r\nconsulted while writing the following pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK TIMES EXPEDITION, 1886.\r\n\r\nAn expedition sent out by the New York _Times_, in charge of\r\nLieutenant Frederick Schwatka, for the purpose of making geographic\r\nexplorations and climbing Mount St. Elias, left Sitka on the U. S. S.\r\n_Pinta_, on July 10, 1886, and reached Yakutat bay two days later. As\r\nit was found impracticable to obtain the necessary assistance from the\r\nIndians to continue the voyage to Icy bay, whence the start inland was\r\nplanned to be made, Captain N. E. Nichols, the commander of the\r\n_Pinta_, concluded to take the expedition to its destination in his\r\nvessel. On July 17 a landing was made through the surf at Icy bay, and\r\nexploration at once began.\r\n\r\nThe party consisted of Lieutenant Schwatka, in charge; Professor\r\nWilliam Libbey, Jr.; and Lieutenant H. W. Seton-Karr. {73} The camp\r\nhands were John Dalton, Joseph Woods, and several Indian packers.[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The accounts of this expedition are as follows: Report\r\nfrom Lieutenant Schwatka in the New York _Times_, October 17, 1886;\r\nSome of the Geographical Features of Southeastern Alaska, by William\r\nLibbey, Jr., in Bull. Am. Geog. Soc., 1886, pp. 279-300; Shores and\r\nAlps of Alaska, by H. W. Seton-Karr, London, 1887, 8°, pp. L-XCV,\r\n142-148; The Alpine Regions of Alaska, by Lieutenant Seton-Karr, in\r\nProc. Roy.

The highest point reached, 7,200 feet, was on the foot-hills of\r\nthe main range now called the Karr hills. The time occupied by the\r\nexpedition, after leaving Icy bay, was nine or ten days. So far as\r\nknown, no systematic surveys were carried on.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of this expedition appeared in Seton-Karr's\r\nbook, \"The Shores and Alps of Alaska.\" Many observations on the\r\nglaciers and moraines of the region explored are recorded in this\r\nwork. The map published with it has been used in compiling the western\r\nportion of the map forming plate 8, where the route of the expedition\r\nis indicated. Another account, especially valuable for its records of\r\nscientific observations, by Professor Libbey, was published by the\r\nAmerican Geographic Society. The Guyot, Agassiz and Tyndall glaciers,\r\nthe Chaix hills, and Lake Castani received their names during this\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Schwatka's graphic and entertaining account of this\r\nexpedition, published in _The Century Magazine_ for April, 1891, gives\r\nmany details of the exploration and illustrates many of the\r\ncharacteristic features of southern Alaska.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPHAM EXPEDITION, 1888.\r\n\r\nAn expedition conducted by Messrs. W. H. and Edwin Topham, of London,\r\nGeorge Broka, of Brussels, and William Williams, of New York, was made\r\nin 1888. Like the _Times_ expedition, it had for its main object the\r\nascent of Mount St. Elias.\r\n\r\nIcy bay was reached, by means of canoes from Yakutat bay, on July 13,\r\nand an inland journey was made northward which {74} covered a large\r\npart of the area traversed by the previous expedition. The highest\r\nelevation reached, according to aneroid barometer and boiling-point\r\nmeasurements, was 11,460 feet. This was on the southern side of St.\r\nElias.\r\n\r\nThe only accounts of this expedition which have come to my notice are\r\nan interesting article by William Williams in _Scribner's\r\nMagazine_,[21] and a more detailed report by H. W. Topham, accompanied\r\nby a map[22] and by a fine illustration of Mount St. Elias, in the\r\nAlpine Journal.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: New York, April, 1889, pp. 387-403.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Topham's map was used in compiling the western portion\r\nof the map forming plate 8, and his route is there indicated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: London, August, 1889, pp. 245-371.]\r\n\r\nThis brief review of explorations carried on in the St. Elias region\r\nprevious to the expedition sent out in 1890 by the National Geographic\r\nSociety is incomplete in many particulars,[24] but will indicate the\r\nmost promising sources of information concerning the country described\r\nin the following pages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Yakutat bay has been visited by vessels of the United\r\nStates Navy and United States Revenue Marine and by numerous trading\r\nvessels; but reports of observations made during these voyages have\r\nnot been found during a somewhat exhaustive search of literature\r\nrelating to Alaska.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF THE ST. ELIAS EXPEDITION OF 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 8. SKETCH MAP OF MOUNT ST. ELIAS REGION, ALASKA,\r\nBy Mark B. Kerr.]\r\n\r\nA long-cherished desire to study the geography, geology, and glaciers\r\nof the region around Mount St. Elias was finally gratified when, in\r\nthe summer of 1890, the National Geographic Society made it possible\r\nfor me to undertake an expedition to that part of Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was organized under the joint auspices of the National\r\nGeographic Society and the United States Geological Survey, but was\r\ngreatly assisted by individuals who felt an interest in the extension\r\nof geographic knowledge. For the inception of exploration and for\r\nsecuring the necessary funds, credit is due Mr. Willard D. Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe names of those who subscribed to the exploration fund of the\r\nSociety are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Boynton Leach.       Henry Gannett.\r\n  Everett Hayden.      Charles J. Bell.\r\n  Richardson Clover.   J. S. Diller.\r\n  C. M. McCarteney.    J. W. Powell.\r\n  C. A. Williams.      J. G. Judd.\r\n  Willard D. Johnson.  A. Graham Bell.\r\n  Israel C. Russell.   Gardiner G. Hubbard.\r\n  Gilbert Thompson.    A. W. Greely.\r\n  Harry King.          J. W. Dobbins.\r\n  Morris Bien.         J. W. Hays.\r\n  Wm. B. Powell.       Edmund Alton.\r\n  Z. T. Carpenter.     Bailey Willis.\r\n  Charles Nordhoff.    E. S. Hosmer.\r\n            Rogers Birnie, Jr.\r\n\r\nI was chosen by the Board of Managers of the National Geographic\r\nSociety and by the Director of the United States Geological Survey to\r\ntake charge of the expedition and to carry on geological and glacial\r\nstudies. Mr. Mark B. Kerr, topographer on the Geological Survey, was\r\nassigned as an assistant, with the duty of making a topographical map\r\nof the region explored. {76} Mr. E. S. Hosmer, of Washington, D. C.,\r\nvolunteered his services as general assistant.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Copies of all instructions governing the work of the\r\nexpedition are given in Appendix A.]\r\n\r\nMr. Kerr left Washington on May 24 for San Francisco, where he made\r\narrangements for his special work, and reported to me at Seattle on\r\nJune 15. I left Washington on May 25 and went directly to Seattle,\r\nwhere the necessary preparations for exploring an unknown and isolated\r\nregion were made.\r\n\r\nFrom the large number of frontiersmen and sailors who applied for\r\npositions on the expedition, seven men were selected as camp hands.\r\nThe foreman of this force was J. H. Christie, of Seattle, who had\r\nspent the previous winter in charge of an expedition in the Olympian\r\nmountains, and was well versed in all that pertains to frontier life.\r\nThe other camp hands were J. H. Crumback, L. S. Doney, W. L. Lindsley,\r\nWilliam Partridge, Thomas Stamy, and Thomas White.\r\n\r\nThe individual members of the party will be mentioned frequently\r\nduring this narrative; but I wish to state at the beginning that very\r\nmuch of the success of the enterprise was due to the hard and faithful\r\nwork of the camp hands, to each one of whom I feel personally\r\nindebted.\r\n\r\nTwo dogs, \"Bud\" and \"Tweed,\" belonging to Mr. Christie, also became\r\nmembers of the expedition.\r\n\r\nAll camp supplies, including tents, blankets, rations, etc., were\r\npurchased at Seattle. Rations for ten men for one hundred days, on the\r\nbasis of the subsistence furnished by the United States Geological\r\nSurvey, were purchased and suitably packed for transportation in a\r\nhumid climate. Twenty-five tin cans were obtained, each measuring 6 x\r\n12 x 14 inches, and in each a mixed ration sufficient for one man for\r\nfifteen days was packed and hermetically sealed. These rations, thus\r\nsecured against moisture and in convenient shape for carrying on the\r\nback (or \"packing\"), were for use above the timber line, where cooking\r\nwas possible only by means of oil stoves. The remainder of the\r\nsupplies, intended for use where fuel for camp-fires could be\r\nobtained, were secured either in tin cans or in canvas sacks.\r\n\r\nFor cooking above timber line, two double-wick oil stoves were\r\nprovided, the usual cast-iron bases being replaced by smaller\r\nreservoirs of tin, in order to avoid unnecessary weight. Coal oil was\r\ncarried in five-gallon cans, but a few rectangular cans {77} holding\r\none gallon each were provided for use while on the march. Subsequent\r\nexperience proved that this arrangement was satisfactory.\r\n\r\nFour seven-by-seven tents, with ridge ropes, and two pyramidal\r\nnine-by-nine center-pole tents, with flies, were provided, all made of\r\ncotton drilling. The smaller tents were for use in the higher camps,\r\nand the larger ones for the base camps. The tents were as light as\r\nseemed practicable, and were found to answer well the purpose for\r\nwhich they were intended.\r\n\r\nEach man was supplied with one double Hudson Bay blanket, a\r\nwater-proof coat, a water-proof hat (the most serviceable being the\r\n\"sou'westers\" used by seamen), and an alpenstock.[26] Each man also\r\ncarried a sheet made of light duck, seven feet square, to protect his\r\nblankets and to be used as a shelter-tent if required. Each member of\r\nthe party was also required to have heavy boots or shoes, and suitable\r\nwoolen clothing. Each man was furnished with two pieces of hemp\r\n\"cod-line,\" 50 feet in length, to be used in packing blankets and\r\nrations. The lines were doubled many times, so as to distribute the\r\nweight on the shoulders, and were connected with two leather straps\r\nfor buckling about the package to be carried. The cod-lines were used\r\ninstead of ordinary pack-straps, for the reason that they distribute\r\nthe weight on the shoulder over a broader area, and also because they\r\ncan be made immediately available for climbing, crossing streams,\r\netc., when required. Several extra lines of the same material were\r\nalso taken as a reserve, or to be used in roping the party together\r\nwhen necessary. Several of the party carried rifles, for each of which\r\na hundred rounds of fixed ammunition were issued. Two ice-axes for the\r\nparty were also provided.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Light rubber cloth was ordered from San Francisco for\r\nthe purpose of allowing each man a water-proof sheet to place under\r\nhis blankets, but was not received in time to be used.]\r\n\r\nA canvas boat was made by the men while en route for the field, but\r\nthere was no occasion to use it, except as a cover for a cache left at\r\none of the earlier camps. Subsequent experience showed that snow-shoes\r\nand one or two sleds would have been serviceable; but these were not\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nOur instruments were furnished by the United States Geological Survey.\r\nThe list included one transit, one gradienter, one sextant, two\r\nprismatic compasses, one compass clinometer, {78} four pocket\r\nthermometers, two psychrometers, one field-glass, two mercurial\r\nbarometers, three aneroids, steel tape-lines, and two photographic\r\noutfits.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SEATTLE TO SITKA.\r\n\r\nPreparations having been completed, the expedition sailed from Seattle\r\nJune 16, on the steamer _Queen_, belonging to the Pacific Coast\r\nSteamship Company, in command of Captain James Carroll, and reached\r\nSitka on the morning of June 24. This portion of our voyage was\r\nthrough the justly celebrated \"inland passage\" of British Columbia and\r\nsoutheastern Alaska, and was in every way delightful. We touched at\r\nVictoria and Wrangell, and, after threading the Wrangell narrows,\r\nentered Frederick sound, where the first floating ice was seen. The\r\nbergs were from a neighboring glacier, which enters the sea at the\r\nhead of a deep inlet, too far away to be seen from the course followed\r\nby the _Queen_. The route northward led through Stephens passage, and\r\nafforded glimpses of glaciers both on the mainland and on Admiralty\r\nisland. In Taku inlet several hours were spent in examining the\r\nglaciers, two of which come down to the sea. One on the western side\r\nof the fjord, an ice-stream known as the Norris glacier, descends\r\nthrough a deep valley and expands into a broad ice-foot on approaching\r\nthe water, though it is not washed by the waves, owing to an\r\naccumulation of mud about its extremity. Another ice-stream is the\r\nTaku glacier, situated at the head of the inlet. It comes boldly down\r\nto the water, and ends in a splendid sea-cliff of azure blue, some 250\r\nfeet high. The adjacent waters are covered with icebergs shed by the\r\nglacier. Some of the smaller fragments were hoisted on board the\r\n_Queen_ for table use. The bold, rocky shores of the inlet are nearly\r\nbare of vegetation, and indicate by their polished and striated\r\nsurfaces that glaciers of far greater magnitude than those now\r\nexisting formerly flowed through this channel.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Taku inlet, a day was spent at Juneau; and then the\r\n_Queen_ steamed up Lynn canal to Pyramid harbor, near its head. For\r\npicturesque beauty, this is probably the finest of the fjords of\r\nAlaska. Several glaciers on each side of the inlet come down nearly to\r\nthe sea, and all the higher mountains are buried beneath perpetual\r\nsnow. On returning from Lynn canal, the _Queen_ visited Glacier bay,\r\nand here passengers were allowed a few hours on shore at the Muir\r\nglacier. The day of our visit {79} was unusually fine, and a splendid\r\nview of the great ice-stream with its many tributaries was obtained\r\nfrom a hill-top about a thousand feet high, on its eastern border. The\r\nglacier discharges into the head of the bay and forms a magnificent\r\nline of ice-cliffs over two hundred feet high and three miles in\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThis portion of the coast of Alaska has been described by several\r\nwriters; yet its bleak shores are still in large part unexplored. To\r\nthe west of the bay rise the magnificent peaks of the Fairweather\r\nrange, from which flow many great ice-streams. The largest of the\r\nglaciers descending from these mountains into Glacier bay is called\r\nthe Pacific glacier. Like the Muir glacier, it discharges vast numbers\r\nof icebergs into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe day after leaving Glacier bay we arrived at Sitka, and as soon as\r\npracticable called on Lieutenant-Commander O. F. Farenholt, of the\r\nU. S. S. _Pinta_, who had previously received instructions from the\r\nSecretary of the Navy to take us to Yakutak bay. We also paid our\r\nrespects to the Governor and other Alaskan officials, and made a few\r\nfinal preparations for the start westward.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SITKA TO YAKUTAT BAY.\r\n\r\nAll of our effects having been transferred to the _Pinta_, we put to\r\nsea early on the morning of June 25.\r\n\r\nHonorable Lyman E. Knapp, Governor of Alaska, taking advantage of the\r\nsailing of the _Pinta_, accompanied us on the voyage. Mr. Henry\r\nBoursin, census enumerator, also joined us for the purpose of\r\nobtaining information concerning the Indians at Yakutak.\r\n\r\nThe morning we left Sitka was misty, with occasional showers; but even\r\nthese unfavorable conditions could not obscure the beauty of the wild,\r\ndensely wooded shore along which we steamed. The weather throughout\r\nthe voyage was thick and foggy and the sea rough. We anchored in De\r\nMonti bay, the first indentation on the eastern shore of Yakutat bay,\r\nlate the following afternoon, without having obtained so much as a\r\nglimpse of the magnificent scenery of the rugged Fairweather range.\r\n\r\nAt Yakutat we found two small Indian villages, one on Khantaak island\r\nand the other on the mainland to the eastward (both shown on plate 8).\r\nThe village on Khantaak island is the older of the two, and consists\r\nof six houses built along the water's edge. The houses are made of\r\nplanks, each hewn from a single {80} log, after the manner of the\r\nThlinkets generally. They are rectangular, and have openings in the\r\nroofs, with wind guards, for the escape of smoke. The fires, around\r\nwhich the families gather, are built in the centers of the spaces\r\nbelow. The houses are entered by means of oval openings, elevated two\r\nfeet above the ground on platforms along their fronts. In the interior\r\nof each there is a rectangular space about twenty feet square\r\nsurrounded by raised platforms, the outer portions of which are shut\r\noff by partitions and divided into smaller chambers.\r\n\r\nThe canoes used at Yakutat are each hewn from a single spruce log, and\r\nare good examples of the boats in use throughout southern Alaska. They\r\nare of all sizes, from a small craft scarcely large enough to hold a\r\nsingle Indian to graceful boats forty or fifty feet in length and\r\ncapable of carrying a ton of merchandise with a dozen or more men.\r\nThey have high, overreaching stems and sterns, which give them a\r\npicturesque, gondola-like appearance.\r\n\r\nThe village on the mainland is less picturesque, if such a term may be\r\nallowed, than the group of houses already described, but it is of the\r\nsame type. Near at hand, along the shore to the southward, there are\r\ntwo log houses, one of which is used at present as a mission by\r\nReverend Carl J. Hendriksen and his assistant, the other being\r\noccupied as a trading post by Sitka merchants.\r\n\r\nThe Yakutat Indians are the most westerly branch of the great Thlinket\r\nfamily which inhabits all of southeastern Alaska and a portion of\r\nBritish Columbia. In intelligence they are above the average of\r\nIndians generally, and are of a much higher type than the native\r\ninhabitants of the older portion of the United States. They are quick\r\nto learn the ways of the white man, and are especially shrewd in\r\nbargaining. They are canoe Indians _par excellence_, and pass a large\r\npart of their lives on the water in quest of salmon, seals, and\r\nsea-otter. During the summer of our visit, about thirty sea-otter were\r\ntaken. They are usually shot in the primitive manner with\r\ncopper-pointed arrows, although repeating rifles of the most improved\r\npatterns are owned by the natives, in spite of existing laws against\r\nselling breech-loading arms to Indians. The fur of the sea-otter is\r\nacknowledged to be the most beautiful, and is the most highly prized\r\nof all pelts. Those taken at Yakutat during our visit were sold at an\r\naverage price of about seventy-five dollars. This, {81} together with\r\nthe sale of less valuable skins and the money received for baskets,\r\netc., made by the women for the tourist trade in Sitka, brought a\r\nconsiderable revenue to the village. Improvident, like nearly all\r\nIndians, the Yakutat villagers soon spend at the trading post the\r\nmoney earned in this way.\r\n\r\nThe Yakutats belong without question to the Thlinket stock; but visits\r\nfrom tribes farther westward, who travel in skin boats, are known to\r\nhave been made, and it seems probable that some mixture of Thlinket\r\nand Innuit blood may occur in the natives at Yakutat. But if such\r\nadmixture has occurred, the Innuit element is so small that it escapes\r\nthe notice of one not skilled in ethnology.\r\n\r\nWe found Mr. Hendriksen most kind and obliging, and are indebted to\r\nhim for many favors and great assistance. Arrangements were made with\r\nhim for reading a base-barometer three times a day during July and\r\nAugust. He also assisted us by acting as an interpreter, and in hiring\r\nIndians and canoes.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued thick and stormy after reaching Yakutat bay, and\r\nCaptain Farenholt did not think it advisable to take his vessel up the\r\nmain inlet, where many dangers were reported to exist. A canoe having\r\nbeen purchased from the trader and others hired from the Indians, a\r\nstart was made from the head of Yakutat bay early on the morning of\r\nJune 28, in company with two of the _Pinta's_ boats loaded with\r\nsupplies, under the command of Ensign C. W. Jungen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANOE TRIP UP YAKUTAT BAY.\r\n\r\nBidding good-bye to our friends on the _Pinta_, to whom we were\r\nindebted for many favors, we started for our trip up the bay in a\r\npouring rain-storm. Our way at first led through the narrow, placid\r\nwater-ways dividing the islands on the eastern side of the bay. The\r\nislands and the shores of the mainland are densely wooded, and\r\nappeared picturesque and inviting even through the veil of mist and\r\nrain that shrouded them. The forests consist principally of spruce\r\ntrees, so dense and having such a tangle of underbrush that it is only\r\nwith the greatest difficulty that one can force a way through them;\r\nwhile the ground beneath the forest, and even the trunks and branches\r\nof the living trees, are covered and festooned with luxuriant growths\r\nof mosses and lichens. Our trip along these wooded shores, but half\r\nrevealed {82} through the drifting mist, was novel and enjoyable in\r\nspite of discomforts due to the rain. We rejoiced at the thought that\r\nwe were nearing the place where the actual labors of the expedition\r\nwould begin; we were approaching the unknown; visions of unexplored\r\nregions filled with new wonders occupied our fancies, and made us\r\neager to press on.\r\n\r\nAbout noon on the first day we pitched our tents on a strip of shingle\r\nskirting the shore of the mainland to the east of Knight island. The\r\n_Pinta's_ boats spread their white wings and sailed away to the\r\nsouthward before a freshening wind, and our last connection with\r\ncivilization was broken. As one of the frontiersmen of our party\r\nremarked, we were \"at home once more.\" It may appear strange to some\r\nthat any one could apply such a term to a camp on the wild shore of an\r\nunexplored country; but the Bohemian spirit is so strong in some\r\nbreasts, and the restraint of civilization so irksome, that the homing\r\ninstinct is reversed and leads irresistibly to the wilderness and to\r\nthe silent mountain tops.\r\n\r\nThe morning after arriving at our first camp, Kerr, Christie, and\r\nHendriksen, with all the camp hands except two, went on with the\r\ncanoes, and in a few hours reached the entrance of Disenchantment bay.\r\nThey found a camping place about twelve miles ahead, on a narrow strip\r\nof shingle beneath the precipices of Point Esperanza, and there\r\nestablished our second camp.\r\n\r\nMy necessary delay at Camp 1 was utilized, so far as possible, in\r\nlearning what I could concerning the adjacent country, and in making a\r\nbeginning in the study of its geology. Our camp was at the immediate\r\nbase of the mountains, and on the northeastern side of the wide\r\nplateau bordering the continent. The plateau stretches southeastward\r\nfor twenty or thirty miles, and is low and heavily forested. The\r\neastern shore of the bay near our first camp is formed of bluffs about\r\n150 feet high, which have been eaten back by the waves so as to expose\r\nfine sections of the strata of sand, gravel and bowlders of which the\r\nplateau is composed. All the lowlands bordering the mountains have,\r\napparently, a common history, and doubtless owe their origin\r\nprincipally to the deposition of débris brought from the mountains by\r\nformer glaciers. When this material was deposited, or soon afterward,\r\nthe land was depressed about 150 feet lower than at present, as is\r\nshown by a terrace cut along the base of the mountains at that\r\nelevation. The steep mountain face {83} extending northwestward from\r\nCamp 1 to the mouth of Disenchantment bay bears evidence of being the\r\nupheaved side of a fault of quite recent origin. The steep inclination\r\nand shattered condition of the rocks along this line are evidently due\r\nto the crushing which accompanied the displacement.\r\n\r\nIn the wild gorge above our first camp, a small glacier was found\r\ndescending to within 500 feet of the sea-level, and giving rise to a\r\nwild, roaring stream of milky water. Efforts to reach the glacier were\r\nfrustrated by the density of the dripping vegetation and by the clouds\r\nthat obscured the mountains.\r\n\r\nA canoe trip was made to a rocky islet between Knight island and the\r\nmainland toward the north. The islet, like the rocks in the adjacent\r\nmountain range, is composed of sandstone, greatly shattered and\r\nseamed, and nearly vertical in attitude. Its surface was densely\r\ncarpeted with grass and brilliant flowers. Many sea birds had their\r\nhomes there. From its summit a fine view was obtained of the\r\ncloud-capped mountains toward the northeast, of the dark forest\r\ncovering Knight island, and of the broad plateau toward the southeast.\r\nSome of the most charming effects in the scenery of the forest-clad\r\nand mist-covered shores of Alaska are due to the wreaths of vapor\r\nascending from the deep forests during the interval in which the warm\r\nsunlight shines through the clouds; and on the day of our visit to the\r\nislet, the forests, when not concealed by mist, sent up smoke-like\r\nvapor wreaths of many fantastic shapes to mingle with the clouds in\r\nwhich the higher mountains disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt Camp 1 the personnel of the party was unexpectedly reduced. Mr.\r\nHosmer was ill, and remained with me at camp instead of pushing on\r\nwith Kerr and Christie; and the weather continuing stormy, he\r\nconcluded to abandon the expedition and return to the mission at Port\r\nMulgrave. Having secured the services of an Indian who chanced to pass\r\nour camp in his canoe, Mr. Hosmer bade us good-bye, ensconced himself\r\nin the frail craft, and started for sunnier lands. It was subsequently\r\nlearned that he reached Yakutak without mishap, and a few days later\r\nsailed for Sitka in a small trading schooner. Our force during the\r\nremainder of the season, not including Mr. Hendriksen and the Indians,\r\nwhose services were engaged for only a few days, numbered nine men all\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of June 30 we had a bright camp-fire blazing on the\r\nbeach to welcome the returning party. Near sunset a {84} canoe\r\nappeared in the distance, and a shot was fired as it came round a bend\r\nin the shore. We felt sure that our companions were returning, and\r\npiled drift-wood on the roaring camp-fire to cheer them after their\r\nhard day's work on the water. As the canoe approached, each dip of the\r\npaddle sent a flash of light to us, and we could distinguish the men\r\nat their work; but we soon discovered that it was occupied not by our\r\nown party but by Indians returning from a seal hunt in Disenchantment\r\nbay. They brought their canoe high on the beach, and made themselves\r\nat home about our camp-fire. There were seven or eight well-built\r\nyoung men in the party, all armed with guns. In former times such an\r\narrival would have been regarded with suspicion; but thanks to the\r\nsomewhat frequent visits of war vessels to Yakutat, and also to the\r\nlabors of missionaries, the wild spirits of the Indians have been\r\ngreatly subdued and reduced to semi-civilized condition during the\r\npast quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nJust as the long twilight deepened into night, another craft came\r\naround the distant headland, but less swiftly than the former one; and\r\nsoon our picturesque canoe, with Christie at the stern steering with a\r\npaddle in true Indian fashion, grated on the shingle beach. Christie\r\nhas spent many years of his life with the Indians of the Northwest,\r\nand has adopted some of their habits. On beginning frontier life once\r\nmore, he discarded the hat of the white man, and wore a blue cloth\r\ntied tightly around his forehead and streaming off in loose ends\r\nbehind. The change was welcome, for it added to the picturesque\r\nappearance of the party.\r\n\r\nThe men, weary with their long row against currents and head-winds,\r\ngreatly enjoyed the camp-fire. Our Indian visitors, after lunching\r\nlightly on the leaf-stalks of a plant resembling celery\r\n(_Archangelica_), which grows abundantly everywhere on the lowlands of\r\nsouthern Alaska, departed toward Yakutat. Supper was served in one of\r\nthe large tents, and we all rolled ourselves in our blankets for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe next day, July 1, we abandoned Camp 1, passed by Camp 2, and late\r\nin the afternoon reached the northwestern side of Yakutat bay,\r\nopposite Point Esperanza. Our trip along the wild shore, against which\r\na heavy surf was breaking, was full of novelty and interest. The\r\nmountains rose sheer from the water to a height of two or three\r\nthousand feet. About their bases, like {85} dark drapery, following\r\nall the folds of the mountain side, ran a band of vegetation; but the\r\nspruce forests had mostly disappeared, and only a few trees were seen\r\nhere and there in the deeper cañons. The position of the terrace along\r\nthe base of the mountain, first noticed at Camp 1, could be plainly\r\ntraced, although densely covered with bushes. The mountain peaks above\r\nwere all sharp and angular, indicating at a glance that they had never\r\nbeen subjected to glacial action. The sandstone and shales forming the\r\nnaked cliffs are fractured and crushed, and are evidently yielding\r\nrapidly to the weather; but the characteristic red color due to rock\r\ndecay could not be seen. The prevailing tone of the mountains, when\r\nnot buried beneath vegetation or covered with snow, is a cold gray.\r\nBright, warm, summer skies are needed to reveal the variety and beauty\r\nof that forbidding region.\r\n\r\nOur large canoe behaved well, although heavily loaded. Sometimes the\r\nwind was favorable, when an extemporized sail lessened the fatigue of\r\nthe trip. The landing on the northwestern shore was effected, through\r\na light surf, on a sandy beach heavily encumbered with icebergs. As it\r\nwas hazardous to beach the large canoe with its load of boxes and\r\nbags, the heavy freight was transferred, a few pieces at a time, to\r\nsmaller canoes, each manned by a single Indian, and all was safely\r\nlanded beyond the reach of the breakers. Camp 3 was established on the\r\nsandy beach just above the reach of the tide and near the mouth of a\r\nroaring brook. The drift-wood along the shore furnished abundant fuel\r\nfor a blazing camp-fire; our tents were pitched, and once more we felt\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nTwo canoes were dispatched, in care of Doney, to the camp on the\r\nopposite shore (Camp 2), with instructions to bring over the\r\nequipments left there. Kerr went over also for the purpose of making a\r\ntopographic station on the bluff forming Point Esperanza should the\r\nmorrow's weather permit.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to note the care which our Indians took of their\r\ncanoes. Not only were they drawn high up on the beach, out of the\r\nreach of all possible tides, but each canoe was swathed in wet cloths,\r\nespecially at the prow and stern, to prevent them from drying and\r\ncracking. The canoes, being fashioned from a single spruce log, are\r\nespecially liable to split if allowed to dry thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe day after our arrival, all of our party and all of our camp {86}\r\noutfit were assembled at Camp 3. Mr. Hendriksen and our Indian friends\r\ntook their departure, and the work for which we had come so far was\r\nactually begun.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASE CAMP ON THE SHORE OF YAKUTAT BAY.\r\n\r\nAbout the tents at Camp 3 the rank grass grew waist-high, sheltering\r\nthe strawberries and dwarf raspberries that bloomed beneath. A little\r\nway back from the shore, clumps of alders, interspersed with spruce\r\ntrees, marked the beginning of the forest which covered the hills\r\ntoward the west and southwest. Toward the north rose rugged mountains,\r\ntheir summits shrouded in mist; in the steep gorges on their sides the\r\nends of glaciers gleamed white, like foaming cataracts descending from\r\ncloudland.\r\n\r\nThe day following our arrival dawned bright and beautiful. Every cloud\r\nvanished from the mountains as by magic, revealing their magnificent\r\nsummits in clear relief. We found ourselves at the base of a rugged\r\nmountain range extending far southeastward and northwestward, its\r\nfirst rampart so breached as to allow the waters of the ocean to\r\nextend into the very midst of the great peaks beyond. Through this\r\nopening we had a splendid view of the snow-clad mountains filling the\r\nnorthern sky and stretching away in lessening perspective toward the\r\neast until they blended with the distant clouds.\r\n\r\nTopographic work was started, and the preparation of \"packs\" for the\r\njourney inland was begun at once; and all hands were kept busy. A\r\nbase-line was measured by Mr. Kerr, and a beginning was made in the\r\ndevelopment of a system of triangulation which was carried on\r\nthroughout the season.\r\n\r\nOur stay at the camp on the shore extended over a week, and enabled us\r\nto become familiar with many of the changes in the rugged scenery\r\nsurrounding Yakutat bay. The bay itself was covered with icebergs for\r\nmost of the time. Owing to the prevailing winds and the action of\r\nshore currents, the ice accumulated on the coast adjacent to our camp.\r\nFor many days the beach toward both the north and the south, as far as\r\nthe eye could reach, was piled high with huge masses of blue and white\r\nice. When the bay was rough, the surf roared angrily among the\r\nstranded bergs and, dashing over them, formed splendid sheets of foam;\r\nwhile on bright, sunny days the bay gleamed and flashed in the\r\nsunlight as the summer winds gently rippled {87} its surface, and the\r\nthousands of icebergs crowding the azure plain seemed a numberless\r\nfleet of fairy boats with crystal hulls and fantastic sails of blue\r\nand white. When the long summer days drew to a close and gave place to\r\nthe soft northern twilight, which in summer lasts until the glow of\r\nthe returning sun is seen in the east, the sea and mountains assumed a\r\nsoft, mysterious beauty never realized by dwellers in more southern\r\nclimes. The hours of twilight were so enchanting, the varying shades\r\nand changing tints on the mighty snow-fields robing the mountains were\r\nso exquisite in their gradations that, even when weary with many hours\r\nof toil, the explorer could not resist the charm, and paced the sandy\r\nshore until the night was far spent. Sometimes in the twilight hours,\r\nlong after the sun disappeared, the summits of the majestic peaks\r\ntoward the east were transformed by the light of the after-glow into\r\nmountains of flame. As the light faded, the cold shadow of the world\r\ncrept higher and higher up the crystal slopes until only the topmost\r\nspires and pinnacles were gilded by the sunset glow. At such times,\r\nwhen our eyes were weary with watching the gorgeous transformation of\r\nthe snow-covered mountains and were turned to the far-reaching seaward\r\nview, we would be startled by the sight of a vast city, with\r\nbattlements, towers, minarets, and domes of fantastic architecture,\r\nrising where we knew that only the berg-covered waters extended. The\r\nappearance of these phantom cities was a common occurrence during the\r\ntwilight hours. Although we knew at once that the ghostly spires were\r\nbut a trick of the mirage, yet their ever-changing shapes and\r\nremarkable mimicry of human habitations were so striking that they\r\nnever lost their novelty; and they were never the same on two\r\nsuccessive evenings. One of the most common deceptions of the mirage\r\nis the transformation of icebergs into the semblance of fountains\r\ngushing from the sea and expanding into graceful, sheaf-like shapes.\r\nThe strangest freaks due to the refraction of light on hot deserts,\r\nwhich are usually supposed to be the home of the mirage, do not excite\r\nthe traveler's wonder so much as the phantom cities seen in the\r\nuncertain twilight amid the ice-packs of the north.\r\n\r\nWhen the slowly deepening twilight transformed mountains and seas into\r\na dreamland picture, the harvest moon, strangely out of place in far\r\nnorthern skies, spread a sheet of silver behind the dark headlands\r\ntoward the southeast, and then slowly appeared, not rising boldly\r\ntoward the zenith, but tracing a low {88} arch in the southern\r\nheavens, to soon disappear into the sea toward the southwest. Brief as\r\nwere her visits, they were always welcome and always brought the\r\nfeeling that distant homes were nearer when the same light was visible\r\nto us and to loved ones far away. The soft moonlight dimmed the\r\ntwilight, the after-glow faded from the highest peaks, and the short\r\nnorthern night came on.\r\n\r\nAfter returning from the mountains, late in September, we were again\r\nencamped on the northwestern shore of Yakutat bay. A heavy northeast\r\nstorm swept down from the mountains and awakened all the pent-up fury\r\nof the waves. The beach was crowded with bergs, among which the surf\r\nbroke in great sheets of feathery foam; clouds of spray were dashed\r\nfar above the icy ramparts, carrying with them fragments of ice torn\r\nfrom the bergs over which they swept; while the stranded bergs rocked\r\nviolently to and fro as the waves burst over them. Sometimes the\r\nraging waters, angered by opposition, lifted the bergs in their mighty\r\narms and, turning them over and over, dashed them high on the beach.\r\nIt seemed as if spirits of the deep, unable to leave the water-world,\r\nwere hurling their weapons at unseen enemies on the land. The fearful\r\ngrandeur of the raging waters and of the dark storm-swept skies was,\r\nperhaps, enhanced by the fact that the landward-blowing gale, combined\r\nwith a rising tide, threatened to sweep away our frail home. Each\r\nsucceeding wave, as it rolled shoreward, sent a sheet of foam roaring\r\nand rushing up the beach and creeping nearer and nearer to our shelter\r\nuntil only a few inches intervened between the highwater line and the\r\ncrest of the sand bank that protected us. The limit was reached at\r\nlast, however, and the water slowly retreated, leaving a fringe of ice\r\nwithin arm's length of our tents.\r\n\r\nThe wild scene along the shore was especially grand at night. The\r\nstranded bergs, seen through the gloom, formed strange moving shapes,\r\nlike vessels in distress. The white banners of spray seemed signals of\r\ndisaster. An Armada, more numerous than ever sailed from the ports of\r\nSpain, was being crushed and ground to pieces by the hoarse wind and\r\nraging surf. Sleep was impossible, even if one cared to rest when sea\r\nand air and sky were joined in fierce conflict. Our tents, spared by\r\nthe waves, were dashed down by the fierce north winds, and a lake in\r\nthe forest toward the west overflowed its banks and discharged its\r\nflooding waters through our encampment. At last, tired and {89}\r\ndiscomforted, we abandoned our tents and retreated to the neighboring\r\nforest and there took refuge in a cabin built near where a coal seam\r\noutcrops, and remained until the storm had spent its force. But I have\r\nanticipated, and must return to the thread of my narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST DAY'S TRAMP.\r\n\r\nThe impressions received during the first day spent on shore in a new\r\ncountry are always long remembered. Of several \"first days\" in my own\r\ncalendar, there are none that exceed in interest my first excursions\r\nthrough the forest and over the hills west of Yakutat bay.\r\n\r\nEvery one about camp having plenty of work to occupy him through the\r\nday, I started out early on the morning of July 2, with only \"Bud\" and\r\n\"Tweed\" for companions. My objects were to reconnoiter the country to\r\nthe westward, to learn what I could concerning its geology and\r\nglaciers, and to choose a line of march toward Mount St. Elias.\r\n\r\nTo the north of our camp, and about a mile distant, rose a densely\r\nwooded hill about 300 feet high, with a curving outline, convex\r\nsouthward. This hill had excited my curiosity on first catching sight\r\nof the shore, and I decided to make it my first study. Its position at\r\nthe mouth of a steep gorge in the hills beyond, down which a small\r\nglacier flowed, suggested that it might be an ancient moraine,\r\ndeposited at a time when the ice-stream advanced farther than at\r\npresent. My surprise therefore was great when, after forcing my way\r\nthrough the dense thickets, I reached the top of the hill, and found a\r\nlarge kettle-shaped depression, the sides of which were solid walls of\r\nice fifty feet high. This showed at once that the supposed hill was\r\nreally the extremity of a glacier, long dead and deeply buried beneath\r\nforest-covered débris. In the bottom of the kettle-like depression lay\r\na pond of muddy water, and, as the ice-cliffs about the lakelet melted\r\nin the warm sunlight, miniature avalanches of ice and stones, mingled\r\nwith sticks and bushes that had been undermined, frequently rattled\r\ndown its sides and splashed into the waters below. Further examination\r\nrevealed the fact that scores of such kettles are scattered over the\r\nsurface of the buried glacier. This ice-stream is that designated the\r\n_Galiano glacier_ on the accompanying map.\r\n\r\nContinuing on my way toward the mouth of the gorge in the {90}\r\nmountains above, I forced my way for nearly a mile through dense\r\nthickets, frequently making wide detours to avoid the kettle holes. At\r\nlength the vegetation became less dense, and gave place to broad open\r\nfields of rocks and dirt, covering the glacier from side to side. This\r\ndébris was clearly of the nature of a moraine, as the ice could be\r\nseen beneath it in numerous crevasses; but no division into marginal\r\nor medial moraines could be distinguished. It is really a thin,\r\nirregular sheet of comminuted rock, together with angular masses of\r\nsandstone and shale, the largest of which are ten or fifteen feet in\r\ndiameter. When seen from a little distance the débris completely\r\nconceals the ice and forms a barren, rugged surface, the picture of\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nAfter traversing this naked area the clear ice in the center of the\r\ngorge was reached. All about were wild cliffs, stretching up toward\r\nthe snow-covered peaks above; several cataracts of ice, formed by\r\ntributary glaciers descending through rugged, highly inclined\r\nchannels, were in sight; while the snow-fields far above gleamed\r\nbrilliantly in the sunlight, and now and then sent down small\r\navalanches to awaken the echoes of the cliffs and fill the still air\r\nwith a Babel of tongues.\r\n\r\nPushing on toward the western border of the glacier, across the barren\r\nfield of stones, I came at length to the brink of a precipice of dirty\r\nice more than a hundred feet high, at the foot of which flowed a swift\r\nstream of turbid water. A few hundred yards below, this stream\r\nsuddenly disappeared beneath an archway formed by the end of a glacial\r\ntunnel, and its further course was lost to view. It was a strange\r\nsight to see a swift, foaming river burst from beneath overhanging\r\nice-cliffs, roar along over a bowlder-covered bed, and then plunge\r\ninto the mouth of a cavern, leaving no trace of its lower course\r\nexcept a dull, heavy rumbling far down below the icy surface. A still\r\ngrander example of these glacial streams, observed a few days later,\r\nis described on another page.\r\n\r\nThe bank of the gulf opposite the point at which I first reached it is\r\nformed by a steep mountain-side supporting a dense growth of\r\nvegetation. Here and there, however, streams of water plunge down the\r\nslope, making a chain of foaming cascades, and opening the way through\r\nthe vegetation. It seemed practicable to traverse one of these stream\r\nbeds without great difficulty, and thus to reach the plateau which I\r\nknew, from a more distant view, to exist above.\r\n\r\n{91} Crossing the glacial river above the upper archway, I reached the\r\nmountain side and began to ascend. The task was far more difficult\r\nthan anticipated. The bushes, principally of alder and currant, grew\r\ndense and extended their branches down the steep slope in such a\r\nmanner that at times it was utterly impossible to force a way through\r\nthem. Much of the way I crawled on hands and knees up the steep\r\nwatercourse beneath the dense tangle of vegetation overhanging from\r\neither bank and interlacing in the center. On nearing the top I was so\r\nfortunate as to strike a bear trail, along which the animal had forced\r\nhis way through the bushes, making an opening like a tunnel. Through\r\nthis I ascended to the top of the slope, coming out in a wild\r\namphitheatre in the side of the mountain. The bottom of the\r\namphitheatre was exceedingly rough, owing to confused moraine-heaps,\r\nand held a number of small lakes. On account of its elevation, it was\r\nnot densely covered with bushes, and no trees were in sight except\r\nalong its southern margin. About its northern border ran a broad\r\nterrace, marking the height of the great glacier which formerly\r\noccupied the site of Yakutat bay. The terrace formed a convenient\r\npathway leading westward to a sharp ridge running out from the\r\nmountains and connecting with an outstanding butte, which promised to\r\nafford an unobstructed view to the westward.\r\n\r\nPressing on, I found that the terrace on which I was traveling at\r\nlength became a free ridge, some three hundred feet high, with steep\r\nslopes on either side, like a huge railroad embankment. This ridge\r\nswept across the valley in a graceful curve, and shut off a portion of\r\nthe western part of the amphitheatre from the general drainage. In the\r\nportion thus isolated there was a lake without an outlet, still\r\nfrozen. The snow banks bordering the frozen lake were traced in every\r\ndirection by the trails of bears. Continuing my tramp, I crossed broad\r\nsnow-fields, climbed the ridge to the westward, and obtained a\r\nfar-reaching, unobstructed view of the surrounding country. The\r\nelevation reached was only about 1,500 feet above sea-level, but was\r\nabove the timber line. The mountain slopes toward the north were bare\r\nof vegetation and generally covered with snow.\r\n\r\nThe first object to claim attention was the huge pyramid forming the\r\nsummit of Mount St. Elias, which stood out clear and sharp against the\r\nnorthwestern sky. Although thirty-six miles distant, it dominated all\r\nother peaks in view and rose far above {92} the rugged crests of\r\nnearer ranges, many of which would have been counted magnificent\r\nmountains in a less rugged land. This was the first view of the great\r\npeak obtained by any of our party. Not a cloud obscured the defination\r\nof the mountain; and the wonderful transparency of the atmosphere,\r\nafter so many days of mist and rain, was something seldom if ever\r\nequalled in less humid lands.\r\n\r\nMuch nearer than St. Elias, and a little west of north of my station,\r\nrose Mount Cook, one of the most beautiful peaks in the region. Its\r\nsummit, unlike the isolated pyramid in which St. Elias terminates, is\r\nformed of three white domes, with here and there subordinate pinnacles\r\nof pure white, shooting up from the snow-fields like great crystals.\r\nOn the southern side of Mount Cook there are several rugged and\r\nangular ridges, which sweep away for many miles and project like\r\nheadlands into the sea of ice, known as the Malaspina glacier,\r\nbordering the ocean toward the southwest. Between the main ridges\r\nthere are huge trunk glaciers, each contributing its flood of ice to\r\nthe great glacier below; and each secondary valley and each\r\namphitheatre among the peaks, no matter how small, has its individual\r\nglacier, and the majority of these are tributary to the larger\r\nice-streams. All the mountains in sight exceeding 2,000 feet in\r\nelevation were white with snow, except the sharpest ridges and boldest\r\nprecipices. The attention of the geologist is attracted by the fact\r\nthat all the foot-hills of Mount Cook are composed of gray sandstone\r\nand black shale; and he also observes that the angular mountain crest\r\nso sharply drawn against the sky furnishes abundant evidence that the\r\nmountains were never subjected to the abrasion of a continuous\r\nice-sheet.\r\n\r\nAs I stood on the steep-sloped ridge, the Atrevida and Lucia glaciers,\r\ntheir surfaces covered from side to side with angular masses of\r\nsandstone and shale, lay at my feet; while farther up the valley the\r\ndébris on the surface of the ice disappeared, and all above was a\r\nwinter landscape. The brown, desolate débris-fields on the glacier at\r\nmy feet extended far southward, and covered the expanded ice-foot in\r\nwhich the glacier terminates. Most curious of all was the fact that\r\nthe moraines on the lower border of the glacier were concealed from\r\nview by a dense covering of vegetation, and in places were clothed\r\nwith forests of spruce trees.\r\n\r\nTo the southward, beyond the end of the Lucia glacier, and separated\r\nfrom it by a torrent-swept bowlder-bed, lay a vast {93} plateau of ice\r\nwhich stretched toward the south and west farther than the eye could\r\nreach. This is the Malaspina glacier, shown on plate 8. Its borders,\r\nlike the expanded extremity of the Lucia glacier, are covered with\r\ndébris, on the outer margins of which dense vegetation has taken root.\r\nAll the central portion of the ice-sheet is clear of moraines, and\r\nshone in the sunlight like a vast snow-field. The heights formerly\r\nreached by the nearer glaciers were plainly marked along the mountain\r\nsides by well-defined terraces, sloping with the present drainage.\r\nWhen the Lucia glacier was at its flood the ridge on which I stood was\r\nonly 200 or 300 feet above its surface; now it approaches 1,000 feet.\r\n\r\nTurning toward the southeast, I could look down upon the waters of\r\nYakutat bay, with its thousands of floating icebergs, and could\r\ndistinguish the white breakers as they rolled in on Ocean cape. Beyond\r\nYakutat stretches a forest-covered plateau between the mountains and\r\nthe sea, and the eye could range far over the mountains bordering this\r\nplateau on the northeast. In the distance, fully a hundred miles away,\r\nstood Mount Fairweather, its position rendered conspicuous by a bank\r\nof shining clouds floating serenely above its cold summit.\r\n\r\nThe mountains directly east of Yakutat bay rise to a general height of\r\nabout 8,000 feet, but are without especially prominent peaks. In a\r\ngeneral way they form a rugged plateau, which has been dissected in\r\nvarious channels to depth of 2,000 or 3,000 feet. Nearly all of the\r\nplateau, including mountains and valleys, is covered with snow-fields\r\nand glaciers; but none of the ice-streams, so far as can be seen from\r\na distance, descend below an elevation of about 4,000 or 5,000 feet.\r\nThis region is as yet untraversed; and when the explorer enters it, it\r\nis quite possible that deep drainage lines will be found through which\r\nglaciers may descend nearly or quite to sea-level.\r\n\r\nAfter drinking in the effect of the magnificent landscape and\r\nendeavoring to impress every detail in the rugged topography upon my\r\nmemory, and having finished writing my notes, it was time to return;\r\nfor the sun was already declining toward the west. Wishing to see more\r\nof the wonderful land about me, I concluded to descend the western\r\nslope of the ridge upon which I stood, and to return to camp by\r\nfollowing a stream which issues from the Atrevida glacier directly\r\nbelow my station and empties into Yakutat bay a mile or two south of\r\nour third camp.\r\n\r\n{94} The quickest and easiest way down was to slide on the snow. Using\r\nmy alpenstock as a brake, I descended swiftly several hundred feet\r\nwithout difficulty, the dogs bounding along beside me, when on looking\r\nup I was startled to see two huge brown bears on the same snow\r\nsurface, a little to the left and not more than a hundred and fifty\r\nyards away. Had my slide been continued a few seconds more I should\r\nhave been in exceedingly unwelcome company. I was unarmed, and\r\nentirely unprepared for a fight with two of the most savage animals\r\nfound in this country. The bears had long yellowish-brown hair, and\r\nwere of the size and character of the \"grizzly,\" with which they are\r\nthought by hunters, if not by naturalists, to be specifically\r\nidentical. They were not at all disturbed by my presence, and in spite\r\nof my shouts, which I thought would make them travel off, one of them\r\ncame leisurely toward me. His strides over the snow revealed a\r\nstrength and activity commanding admiration despite the decidedly\r\nuncomfortable feeling awakened by his proximity and evident curiosity.\r\nLater in the season I measured the tracks of an animal of the same\r\nspecies, made while walking over a soft, level surface, and found each\r\nimpression to measure 9 by 17 inches, and the stride to reach 64\r\ninches. So far as I have been able to learn, this is the largest bear\r\ntrack that has been reported. Realizing my danger, I continued my snow\r\nslide, but in a different direction and with accelerated speed. The\r\nupper limit of the dense thicket clothing the slope of the mountain\r\nwas soon reached, and my unwelcome companions were lost to sight.\r\n\r\nFollowing the bed of a torrent fed by the snow-fields above, I soon\r\ncame to the creek chosen for my route back to camp; the waters, brown\r\nand turbid with sediment, welled out of a cavern at the foot of an ice\r\nprecipice 200 feet high, and formed a roaring stream too deep and too\r\nswift for fording. The roaring of the brown waters and the startling\r\nnoises made by stones rattling down the ice-cliff, together with the\r\ndark shadows of the deep gorge, walled in by a steep mountain slope on\r\none side and a glacier on the other, made the route seem uncanny. On\r\nthe sands filling the spaces between the bowlders there were many\r\nfresh bear tracks, which at least suggested that the belated traveler\r\nshould be careful in his movements.\r\n\r\nThis locality was afterward occupied as a camping place, and is shown\r\nin the picture forming plate 10. The dark-colored ice, {95} mixed with\r\nstones and earth, might easily be mistaken for stratified rock; but\r\nthe dirt discoloring the ice is almost entirely superficial. The crest\r\nof the cliff is formed of débris, and is the edge of the sheet of\r\nstones and earth covering the general surface of the glacier. Owing to\r\nthe constant melting, stones and bowlders are continually loosened to\r\nrattle down the steep slope and plunge into the water beneath.\r\n\r\nI followed down the bank of the stream, by springing from bowlder to\r\nbowlder, for about a mile, and then came to a steep bluff, the western\r\nside of which was swept by the roaring flood. The banks above were\r\nclothed with spruce trees and dense underbrush; but, there being no\r\nalternative, I entered the forest and slowly worked my way in the\r\ndirection of camp. To traverse the unbroken forests of southern Alaska\r\nis always difficult, even when one is fresh; and, weary as I was with\r\nmany hours of laborious climbing, my progress was slow indeed. One of\r\nthe principal obstacles encountered in threading these Arctic jungles\r\nis the plant known as the \"Devil's club\" (_Panax horridum_), which\r\ngrows to a height of ten or fifteen feet, and has broad, palmate\r\nleaves that are especially conspicuous in autumn, owing to their\r\nbright yellow color. The stems of this plant run on the earth for\r\nseveral feet and then curve upward. Every portion of its surface, even\r\nto the ribs of the leaves, is thickly set with spines, which inflict\r\npainful wounds, and, breaking off in the flesh, cause festering sores.\r\nIn forcing a way through the brush one frequently treads on the\r\nprostrate portion of these thorny plants, and not infrequently is made\r\naware of the fact by a blow on the head or in the face from the\r\nover-arching stems.\r\n\r\nI struggled on through the tangled vegetation until the sun went down\r\nand the woods became dark and somber. Thick moss, into which the foot\r\nsank as in a bed of sponge, covered the ground everywhere to the depth\r\nof two or three feet; each fallen trunk was a rounded mound of green\r\nand brown, decked with graceful equiseta and ferns, or brilliant with\r\nflowers, but most treacherous and annoying to the belated traveler. In\r\nthe gloom of the dim-lit woods, the trees, bearded with moss, assumed\r\nstrange, fantastic shapes, which every unfamiliar sound seemed to\r\nstart into life; while the numerous trails made by the bears in\r\nforcing their way through the thick tangle were positive evidence that\r\nnot all the inhabitants of the forest were creatures of the\r\nimagination. My faithful companions, \"Bud\" and {96} \"Tweed\" showed\r\nsigns of weariness, and offered no objection when I started a fire and\r\nexpressed my intention of spending the night beneath the\r\nwide-spreading branches of a moss-covered evergreen. Having a few\r\npieces of bread in my pocket, I shared them with the dogs, and\r\nstretching myself on a luxuriant bank of lichens tried to sleep, only\r\nto find the mosquitoes so energetic that there was no hope of passing\r\nthe night in comfort.\r\n\r\nAfter resting I felt refreshed, and concluded to press on through the\r\ngathering darkness, and after another hour of hard work I came out of\r\nthe forest and upon a field of torrent-swept bowlders, deposited by\r\nthe stream which I had left farther up. I was surprised to find that\r\nthe twilight was not so far spent as I had fancied. The way ahead\r\nbeing free of vegetation, I hastened on, and after traveling about two\r\nmiles was rejoiced by the sight of a camp-fire blazing in the\r\ndistance. The warm fire and a hearty supper soon made me forget the\r\nfatigues of the day.\r\n\r\nThis, my first day's exploration, must stand as an example of many\r\nsimilar days spent on the hills and in the forests northwest of\r\nYakutat bay, of which it is not necessary to give detailed\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANOE TRIP IN DISENCHANTMENT BAY.\r\n\r\nOn July 3, I continued my examination of the region about the head of\r\nYakutat bay by making a canoe trip up Disenchantment bay to Haenke\r\nisland. With the assistance of Christie and Crumback, our canoe was\r\nlaunched through the surf without difficulty, and we slowly worked our\r\nway through the fields of floating ice which covered all the upper\r\nportion of the inlet. The men plied the oars with which the canoe was\r\nfortunately provided, while I directed its course with a paddle. A\r\nheavy swell rolling in from the ocean rendered the task of choosing a\r\nroute through the grinding ice-pack somewhat difficult. After four or\r\nfive hours of hard work, during which time several vain attempts were\r\nmade to traverse leads in the ice which had only one opening, we\r\nsucceeded in reaching the southern end of the island.\r\n\r\nThe shores of Haenke island are steep and rocky, and, so far as I am\r\naware, afford only one cove in which a boat can take refuge. This is\r\nat the extreme southern point, and is not visible until its entrance\r\nis reached. A break or fissure in the rocks there admits of the\r\naccumulation of stone and sand, and this {97} has been extended by the\r\naction of the waves and tides until a beach a hundred feet in length\r\nhas been deposited. The dashing of the bowlders and sand against the\r\ncliffs at the head of the cove by the incoming waves has increased its\r\nextension in that direction so as to form a well-sheltered refuge. The\r\nabsence of beaches on other portions of the island is due to the fact\r\nthat its bordering precipices descend abruptly into deep water, and do\r\nnot admit of the accumulation of débris about their bases. Without\r\nstones and sand with which the waves can work, the excavation of\r\nterraces is an exceedingly slow operation. The precipitous nature of\r\nthe borders of the island is due, to some extent at least, to the\r\nabrasion of the rocks by the glacial ice which once encircled it.\r\n\r\nPulling our canoe far up on the beach, we began the ascent of the\r\ncliffs. Hundreds of sea birds, startled from their nests by our\r\nintrusion, circled fearlessly about our heads and filled the air with\r\ntheir wild cries. The more exposed portions of the slopes were bare of\r\nvegetation, but in the shelter of every depression dense thickets\r\nobstructed the way. Many of the little basins between the rounded\r\nknolls hold tarns of fresh water, and were occupied at the time of our\r\nvisit by flocks of gray geese. It is evident that the island was\r\nintensely glaciated at no distant day. The surfaces of its rounded\r\ndomes are so smoothly polished that they glitter like mirrors in the\r\nsunlight. On the polished surfaces there are deep grooves and fine,\r\nhair-like lines, made by the stones set in the bottom of the glacier\r\nwhich once flowed over the island and removed all of the rocks that\r\nwere not firm and hard. On many of the domes of sandstone there rest\r\nbowlders of a different character, which have evidently been brought\r\nfrom the mountains toward the northeast.\r\n\r\nThe summit of the island is about 800 feet above the level of the sea,\r\nand, like its sides, is polished and striated. The terraces on the\r\nmountains of the mainland show that the glacier which formerly flowed\r\nout from Disenchantment bay must have been fully 2,000 feet deep. The\r\nbed it occupied toward the south is now flooded by the waters of\r\nYakutat bay.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Malaspina's visit, 100 years ago, the glaciers from the\r\nnorth reached Haenke island, and surrounded it on three sides.[27] At\r\nthe rate of retreat indicated by comparing {98} Malaspina's records\r\nwith the present condition, the glaciers must have reached Point\r\nEsperanza, at the mouth of Disenchantment bay, about 200 years ago;\r\nand an allowance of between 500 and 1,000 years would seem ample for\r\nthe retreat of the glaciers since they were at their flood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The map accompanying Malaspina's report and indicating\r\nthese conditions has already been mentioned, and is reproduced on\r\nplate 7, page 67.]\r\n\r\nReaching the topmost dome of Haenke island, a wonderful panorama of\r\nsnow-covered mountains, glaciers, and icebergs lay before us. The\r\nisland occupies the position of the stage in a vast amphitheatre; the\r\nspectators are hoary mountain peaks, each a monarch robed in ermine\r\nand bidding defiance to the ceaseless war of the elements. How\r\ninsignificant the wanderer who confronts such an audience, and how\r\nweak his efforts to describe such a scene!\r\n\r\nFrom a wild cliff-enclosed valley toward the north, guarded by\r\ntowering pinnacles and massive cliffs, flows a great glacier, the\r\nfountains of which are far back in the heart of the mountains beyond\r\nthe reach of vision. Having vainly sought an Indian name for this\r\nice-stream, I concluded to christen it the _Dalton glacier_, in honor\r\nof John Dalton, a miner and frontiersman now living at Yakutat, who is\r\njustly considered the pioneer explorer of the region. The glacier is\r\ngreatly shattered and pinnacled in descending its steep channel, and\r\non reaching the sea it expands into a broad ice-foot. The last steep\r\ndescent is made just before gaining the water, and is marked by\r\ncrevasses and pinnacles of magnificent proportion and beautiful color.\r\nThis is one of the few glaciers in the St. Elias region that has\r\nwell-defined medial and lateral moraines. At the bases of the cliffs\r\non the western side there is a broad, lateral moraine, and in the\r\ncenter, looking like a winding road leading up the glacier, runs a\r\ntriple-banded ribbon of débris, forming a typical medial moraine. The\r\nmorainal material carried by the glacier is at last deposited at its\r\nfoot, or floated away by icebergs, and scattered far and wide over the\r\nbottom of Yakutat bay.\r\n\r\nThe glacier expands on entering the water, as is the habit of all\r\nglaciers when unconfined, and ends in magnificent ice-cliffs some two\r\nmiles in length. The water dashing against the bases of the cliffs\r\ndissolves them away, and the tides tend to raise and lower the\r\nexpanded ice-foot. The result is that huge masses, sometimes reaching\r\nfrom summit to base of the cliffs, are undermined, and topple over\r\ninto the sea with a tremendous crash. Owing to the distance of the\r\nglacier from Haenke island, we could {99} see the fall long before the\r\nroar reached our ears; the cliffs separated, and huge masses seemed to\r\nsink without a sound; the spray thrown up as the blue pinnacles\r\ndisappeared ascended like gleaming rockets, sometimes as high as the\r\ntops of the cliffs, and then fell back in silent cataracts of foam.\r\nThen a noise as of a cannonade came rolling across the waters and\r\nechoing from cliff to cliff. The roar of the glacier continues all day\r\nwhen the air is warm and the sun bright, and is most active when the\r\nsummer days are finest. Sometimes, roar succeeded roar, like artillery\r\nfire, and the salutes were answered, gun for gun, by the great Hubbard\r\nglacier, which pours its flood of ice into the fjord a few miles\r\nfurther northeastward. This ice-stream, most magnificent of the\r\ntide-water glaciers of Alaska yet discovered, and a towering mountain\r\npeak from which the glacier receives a large part of its drainage,\r\nwere named in honor of Gardiner G. Hubbard, president of the National\r\nGeographic Society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 9. HUBBARD GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nLooking across the waters of the bay, whitened by thousands of\r\nfloating bergs, we could see three miles of the ice-cliffs formed\r\nwhere the Hubbard glacier enters the sea. A dark headland on the shore\r\nof the mainland to the right shut off the full view of the glacier but\r\nformed a strongly drawn foreground, which enhanced the picturesque\r\neffect of the scenery. The Hubbard glacier flows majestically through\r\na deep valley leading back into the mountains, and has two main\r\nbranches, with a smaller and steeper tributary between. These branches\r\nunite to form a single ice-foot extending into the bay. The western\r\nbranch has a dark medial moraine down its center, which makes a bold,\r\nsweeping curve before joining the main stream. There is also a broad\r\nlateral débris-belt along the bases of the cliffs forming its right\r\nbank. The whole surface of the united glacier, and all of the white\r\ntongues running back into the mountains beyond the reach of vision,\r\nare broken and shattered, owing to the steepness and roughness of the\r\nbed over which they flow. The surface, where not concealed by morainal\r\nmaterial, is snow-white; but in the multitude of crevasses the blue\r\nice is exposed, and gives a greenish-blue tint to the entire stream.\r\nWhere the subglacial slopes are steep, the ice is broken into\r\npinnacles and towers of the grandest description.\r\n\r\nOn the steep mountain sides sloping toward the Hubbard glacier there\r\nare more than a dozen secondary ice-streams which are tributary to it.\r\nThe amphitheatres in which the glacier has {100} its beginnings have\r\nnever been seen; but our general knowledge of the fountains from which\r\nglaciers flow assures us that not only scores but hundreds of other\r\nsecondary and tertiary glaciers far back into the mountains contribute\r\ntheir floods to the same great stream.\r\n\r\nAfter being received on board the _Corwin_, late in September, we had\r\nan opportunity to view the great sea-cliffs of the Hubbard glacier\r\nnear at hand. Captain Hooper, attracted by the magnificent scenery,\r\ntook his vessel up Disenchantment bay to a point beyond Haenke island,\r\nwhence a view could be had of the eastern extension of the inlet. So\r\nfar as is known, the _Corwin_ was the first vessel to navigate those\r\nwaters. Soundings made between the island and the ice-foot gave forty\r\nto sixty fathoms. At the elbow, where the southeastern shore of the\r\nbay turns abruptly eastward, there is a low islet not represented on\r\nany map previous to the one made by the recent expedition, which\r\ncommands even a wider prospect than can be obtained from Haenke\r\nisland. Future visitors to this remote coast should endeavor to reach\r\nthis islet, after having beheld the grand panorama obtainable from the\r\nsummit of Haenke island. The portion of Disenchantment bay stretching\r\neastward from the foot of Hubbard glacier is enclosed on all sides by\r\nbold mountains, the lower slopes of which have the subdued and flowing\r\noutlines characteristic of glaciated regions. Several glaciers occur\r\nin the high-grade lateral valleys opening from the bay; but these have\r\nrecently retreated, and none of them have sufficient volume at present\r\nto reach the water. The general recession, in which all the glaciers\r\nof Alaska are participating, is manifested here by the broad débris\r\nfields, which cover all the lower ice-streams not ending in the sea.\r\nThe absence of vegetation on the smooth rocks recently abandoned by\r\nthe ice also tells of recent climatic changes.\r\n\r\nA débris-covered glacier, so completely concealed by continuous sheets\r\nof stones and earth that its true character can scarcely be\r\nrecognized, descends from the mountains just east of Hubbard glacier.\r\nIt is formed by the union of two principal tributaries, and, on\r\nreaching comparatively level ground, expands into a broad ice-foot,\r\nbut does not have sufficient volume to reach the sea. Another glacier,\r\nof smaller size but of the same general character, lies between the\r\nHubbard and Dalton glaciers.\r\n\r\nIn a rugged defile in the mountains just west of Haenke island there\r\nis another small dirt-covered glacier, which creeps down from the\r\nprecipices above and reaches within a mile of the water. {101} At its\r\nend there is a cliff of black, dirty ice, scarcely to be distinguished\r\nfrom rock at a little distance, from the base of which flows a turbid\r\nstream. This glacier is covered so completely with earth and stones\r\nthat not a vestige of the ice can be seen unless we actually traverse\r\nits surface. Its appearance suggests the name of _Black glacier_, by\r\nwhich it is designated on the accompanying map.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to Haenke island has examples of at least two well-marked\r\ntypes of glaciers in view: The small débris-covered ice-streams, too\r\nsmall to reach the water, are typical of a large class of glaciers in\r\nsouthern Alaska, which are slowly wasting away and have become buried\r\nbeneath débris concentrated at the surface by reason of their own\r\nmelting. The Galiano glacier is a good example of this class. The\r\nHubbard and Dalton glaciers are fine examples of another class of\r\nice-streams which flow into the sea and end in ice-cliffs, and which\r\nfor convenience we call _tide-water glaciers_. Nowhere can finer or\r\nmore beautiful examples of this type be found than those in view from\r\nHaenke island.\r\n\r\nThe formation of icebergs from the undermining and breaking down of\r\nthe ice-cliffs of the tide-water glaciers has already been mentioned.\r\nBut there is another method by which bergs are formed--a process even\r\nmore remarkable than the avalanches that occur when portions of the\r\nice-cliffs topple over into the sea. The ice-cliffs at the foot of the\r\ntide-water glaciers are really sea-cliffs formed by the waves cutting\r\nback a terrace in the ice. The submerged terrace is composed of ice,\r\nand may extend out a thousand feet or more in front of the visible\r\npart of the ice-cliffs. These conditions are represented in the\r\naccompanying diagram (figure 1), which exhibits a longitudinal section\r\nof the lower end of a tide-water glacier where it pushes out into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1--_Diagram illustrating the Formation of\r\nIcebergs_.]\r\n\r\nAs the sea-cliff of ice recedes and the submerged terrace increases in\r\nbreadth there comes a time when the buoyancy of the {102} ice at the\r\nbottom exceeds its strength, and pieces break off and rise to the\r\nsurface. The water about the ends of the glaciers is so intensely\r\nmuddy that the submerged ice-foot is hidden from view, and its\r\npresence would not be suspected were it not for the fragments\r\noccasionally rising from it. The sudden appearance of these masses of\r\nbottom ice at the surface is always startling. While watching the\r\nice-cliffs and admiring the play of colors in the deep crevasses which\r\npenetrate them in every direction, or tracing in fancy the strange\r\nhistory of the silent river and wondering in what age the snows fell\r\non the mountains, which are now returning to their parent, the sea,\r\none is frequently awakened by a commotion in the waters below, perhaps\r\nseveral hundred feet in front of the ice-cliffs. At first it seems as\r\nif some huge sea-monster had risen from the deep and was lashing the\r\nwaters into foam; but soon the waters part, and a blue island rises to\r\nthe surface, carrying hundreds of tons of water, which flows down its\r\nsides in cataracts of foam. Some of the bergs turn completely over on\r\nemerging, and thus add to the tumult and confusion that attends their\r\nbirth. The waves roll away in widening circles, to break in surf on\r\nthe adjacent shores, and an island of ice of the most lovely blue\r\nfloats serenely away to join the thousands of similar islands that\r\nhave preceded it. The fragments of the glacier rising from the bottom\r\nin this manner are usually larger than those broken from the faces of\r\nthe ice-cliffs, sometimes measuring 200 or 300 feet in diameter. Their\r\nsize and the suddenness with which they rise would insure certain\r\ndestruction of a vessel venturing too near the treacherous ice-walls.\r\n\r\nAt the time of our visit to Haenke island, the entire surface of\r\nDisenchantment bay and all of Yakutat bay as far southward as we could\r\nsee formed one vast field of floating ice. Most of the bergs were\r\nsmall, but here and there rose masses which measured 150 by 200 feet\r\non their sides and stood 40 or 50 feet out of the water. The bergs are\r\ndivided, in reference to color, into three classes--the white, the\r\nblue, and the black. The white ones are those that have fallen from\r\nthe face of the ice-walls or those that have been sufficiently exposed\r\nto the atmosphere to become melted at the surface and filled with air\r\ncavities. The blue bergs are of many shades and tints, finding their\r\nnearest match in color in Antwerp blue. These are the ones that have\r\nrecently risen from the submerged ice-foot, or have turned over owing\r\nto a change of position in the center of gravity. Rapid as is the\r\n{103} melting of the ice when exposed to the air, it seems to liquefy\r\neven more quickly when submerged. The changes thus produced finally\r\ncause the bergs to reverse their positions in the water. This is done\r\nwithout the slightest warning, and is one of the greatest dangers to\r\nbe guarded against while canoeing among them. The white color\r\npresented by the majority of the bergs is changed to blue when they\r\nbecome stranded, and the surf breaks over them and dissolves away\r\ntheir porous surfaces. A few of the bergs are black in color, owing to\r\nthe dirt and stones that they carry on their surfaces or frozen in\r\ntheir mass. Quantities of débris are thus floated away from the\r\ntide-water glaciers and strewn over the bottoms of the adjacent\r\ninlets.\r\n\r\nThis digression may be wearisome, but one cannot stand on Haenke\r\nisland without wishing to know all the secrets of the great\r\nice-streams that flow silently before him.\r\n\r\nReturning from our commanding station at the summit of the island to\r\nwhere we left our canoe, we were surprised and not a little startled\r\nto find that the tide had run out and left the strand between our\r\ncanoe and the water completely blocked with huge fragments of ice.\r\nThere was no way left for us to launch our canoe except by cutting\r\naway and leveling off the ice with our axe, so as to form a trail over\r\nwhich we could drag it to the water. This we did, and then, poising\r\nthe canoe on a low flat berg, half of which extended beneath the\r\nwater, I took my place in it with paddle in hand, while Christie and\r\nCrumback, waiting for the moment when a large wave rolled in, launched\r\nthe canoe far out in the surf. By the vigorous use of my paddle I\r\nsucceeded in reaching smooth water and brought the canoe close under\r\nthe cliff forming the southern side of the cove, where the men were\r\nable to drop in as a wave rolled under us.\r\n\r\nWe slowly worked our way down the bay through blue lanes in the\r\nice-pack, against an incoming tide, and reached our tents near sunset.\r\nThus ended one of the most enjoyable and most instructive days at\r\nYakutat bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM YAKUTAT BAY TO BLOSSOM ISLAND.\r\n\r\nOur camp on the shore of Yakutat bay was held for several days after\r\nreturning from Haenke island, but in the meantime an advance-camp was\r\nestablished on the side of the Lucia glacier, from which Mr. Kerr and\r\nmyself made explorations ahead.\r\n\r\n{104} Before leaving the base-camp I visited Black glacier for the\r\npurpose of taking photographs and studying the appearance of an old\r\nglacier far spent and fast passing away. This, like the Galiano\r\nglacier, is a good example of a great number of ice-streams in the\r\nsame region which are covered from side to side with débris. The cañon\r\nwalls on either side rise precipitously, and their lower slopes, for\r\nthe height of 200 or 300 feet, are bare of vegetation. The surface of\r\nthe glacier has evidently sunken to this extent within a period too\r\nshort to allow of the accumulation of soil and the rooting of plants\r\non the slopes. The banks referred to are in part below the upper limit\r\nof timber growth, and the adjacent surfaces are covered with bushes,\r\ngrasses, and flowers. Under the climatic conditions there prevailing,\r\nit is evident that the formation of soil and the spreading of plants\r\nover areas abandoned by ice is a matter of comparatively few years. It\r\nis for this reason that a very recent retreat of Black glacier is\r\ninferred. Many of the glaciers in southern Alaska give similar\r\nevidence of recent contraction, and it is evident that a climatic\r\nchange is in progress which is either decreasing the winter's snow or\r\nincreasing the summer's heat. The most sensitive indicators of these\r\nchanges, responding even more quickly than does the vegetation, are\r\nthe glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe fourth of July was spent by us in cutting a trail up the steep\r\nmountain slope to the amphitheatre visited during my first tramp. No\r\none can appreciate the density and luxuriance of the vegetation on the\r\nlower mountain in that region until he has cut a passage through it.\r\nSeven men, working continuously for six or seven hours with axes and\r\nknives, were able to open a comparatively good trail about a mile in\r\nlength. The remainder of the way was along stream courses and up\r\nbowlder-washes, which were free from vegetation. In the afternoon,\r\nhaving finished our task, a half-holiday was spent in an exciting\r\nsearch for two huge brown bears discovered by one of the party, but\r\nthey vanished before the guns could be brought out.\r\n\r\nThe next day an advance-camp was made in the amphitheatre above timber\r\nline, and there Mr. Kerr and myself passed the night, molested only by\r\nswarms of mosquitoes, and the day following occupied an outstanding\r\nbutte as a topographical station. In the afternoon of the same day the\r\nadvance-camp was moved to the border of the Atrevida glacier at a\r\npoint already described, where a muddy stream gushes out from under\r\nthe ice.\r\n\r\n{105} Our next advance-camp, established a few days later, was at\r\nTerrace point, as we called the extreme end of the mountain spur\r\nseparating the Lucia and Atrevida glaciers. These ice-streams were\r\nformerly much higher than now, and when at their flood formed terraces\r\nalong the mountain side, which remain distinctly visible to the\r\npresent day. The space between the two glaciers at the southern end of\r\nthe mountain spur became filled with bowlders and stones carried down\r\non the side of the ice-streams, and, as the glaciers contracted, added\r\na tapering point to the mountain. Between the present surface of the\r\nice and the highest terrace left at some former time there are many\r\nridges, sloping down stream, which record minor changes in the\r\nfluctuation of the ice. A portion of one of these terraces is seen to\r\nthe left in plate 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 10. WALL OF ICE ON EASTERN SIDE OF THE ATREVIDA\r\nGLACIER.]\r\n\r\nTerrace point, like all the lower portions of the mountain spurs\r\nextending southward from the main range, is densely clothed with\r\nvegetation, and during the short summers is a paradise of flowers. Our\r\ntent was pitched on a low terrace just beyond the border of the ice.\r\nThe steep bluff rising to an elevation of some 200 feet on the east of\r\nour camp was formed by glacial ice buried beneath an absolutely barren\r\ncovering of stones and dirt. On the west the ascent was still more\r\nprecipitous, but the slope from base to summit was one mass of\r\ngorgeous flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 11. VIEW ON THE ATREVIDA GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nKerr and myself made several excursions from the camp at Terrace\r\npoint, and explored the country ahead to the next mountain spur for\r\nthe purpose of selecting a site for another advance-camp. In the\r\nmeantime the men were busy in bringing up supplies.\r\n\r\nOur reconnoissance westward took us across the Lucia glacier to the\r\nmouth of a deep, transverse gorge in the next mountain spur. The\r\ncongeries of low peaks and knobs south of this pass we named the\r\n_Floral hills_, on account of the luxuriance of the vegetation\r\ncovering them; and the saddle separating them from the mountains to\r\nthe north was called _Floral pass_.\r\n\r\nIn crossing the Lucia glacier we experienced the usual difficulties\r\nmet with on the débris-covered ice-field of Alaska. The way was\r\nexceedingly rough, on account of the ridges and valleys on the ice,\r\nand on account of the angular condition of the débris resting upon it.\r\nMany of the ridges could not conveniently be climbed, owing to the\r\nuncertain footing afforded by the angular {106} stones resting on the\r\nslippery slope beneath. Fortunately, the crevasses were mostly filled\r\nwith stones fallen from the sides, so that the danger from open\r\nfissures, which has usually to be guarded against in glacial\r\nexcursions, was obviated; yet, as is usually the case when crevasses\r\nbecome filled with débris, the melting of the adjacent surfaces had\r\ncaused them to stand in relief and form ridges of loose stones, which\r\nwere exceedingly troublesome to the traveler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 12. ENTRANCE TO AN ICE TUNNEL; FORMERLY THE\r\nOUTLET OF A GLACIAL LAKE.]\r\n\r\nNear the western side of the Lucia glacier, between Terrace point and\r\nFloral pass, there is a huge rounded dome of sandstone rising boldly\r\nout of the ice. This corresponds to the \"nunataks\" of the Greenland\r\nice-fields, and was covered by ice when the glaciation was more\r\nintense than at present. On the northern side of the island the ice is\r\nforced high up on its flanks, and is deeply covered with moraines; but\r\non the southwestern side its base is low and skirted by a sand plain\r\ndeposited in a valley formerly occupied by a lake. The melting of the\r\nglacier has, in fact, progressed so far that the dome of rock is free\r\nfrom ice on its southern side, and is connected with the border of the\r\nvalley toward the west by the sand plain. This plain is composed of\r\ngravel and sand deposited by streams which at times became dammed\r\nlower down and expanded into a lake. Sunken areas and holes over\r\nportions of the lake bottom show that it rests, in part at least, upon\r\na bed of ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 13. DELTAS IN AN ABANDONED LAKE BED.]\r\n\r\nThe most novel and interesting feature in the Lucia glacier is a\r\nglacial river which bursts from beneath a high archway of ice just at\r\nthe eastern base of the nunatak mentioned above, and flows for about a\r\nmile and a half through a channel excavated in the ice, to then enter\r\nthe mouth of another tunnel and become lost to view. An illustration\r\nof this strange river and of the mouth of the tunnel in the\r\ndébris-covered ice into which it rolls, reproduced from a photograph\r\nby a mechanical process, is given on plate 14, and another view of the\r\nmouth of the same tunnel is presented in the succeeding plate. This is\r\nthe finest example of a glacial river that it has ever been my good\r\nfortune to examine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 14. A RIVER ON THE LUCIA GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nThe stream is swift, and its waters are brown and heavy with sediment.\r\nIts breadth is about 150 feet. For the greater part of its way, where\r\nopen to sunlight, it flows between banks of ice and over an icy floor.\r\nFragments of its banks, and portions of {107} the sides and roof of\r\nthe tunnel from which it emerges, are swept along by the swift\r\ncurrent, or stranded here and there in midstream. The sand plain\r\nalready mentioned borders the river for a portion of its course, and\r\nis flooded when the lower tunnel is obstructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 15. ENTRANCE TO A GLACIAL TUNNEL.]\r\n\r\nThe archway under which the stream disappears is about fifty feet\r\nhigh, and the tunnel retains its dimensions as far as one can see by\r\nlooking in at its mouth. Where the stream emerges is unknown; but the\r\nemergence could no doubt be discovered by examining the border of the\r\nglacier some miles southward. No explorer has yet been bold enough to\r\nenter the tunnel and drift through with the stream, although this\r\ncould possibly be done without great danger. The greatest risk in such\r\nan undertaking would be from falling blocks of ice. While I stood near\r\nthe mouth of the tunnel there came a roar from the dark cavern within,\r\nreverberating like the explosion of a heavy blast in the chambers of a\r\nmine, that undoubtedly marked the fall of an ice mass from the arched\r\nroof. The course of the stream below the mouth of the tunnel may be\r\ntraced for some distance by scarps in the ice above, formed by the\r\nsettling of the roof. Some of these may be traced in the\r\nillustrations. When the roof of the tunnel collapses so completely as\r\nto obstruct the passage, a lake is formed above the tunnel, and when\r\nthe obstruction is removed the streams draining the glacier are\r\nflooded.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the tunnel there are always confused noises and\r\nrhythmic vibrations to be heard in the dark recesses within. The air\r\nis filled with pulsations like deep organ notes. It takes but little\r\nimagination to transform these strange sounds into the voices and\r\nsongs of the mythical inhabitants of the nether regions.\r\n\r\nToward the right of the tunnel, as shown on plate 14, there appears a\r\nportion of the former river bed, now abandoned, owing to the cutting\r\nacross of a bend in the stream. The floor of this old channel is\r\nmostly of clear, white ice, and has a peculiar, hummocky appearance,\r\nwhich indicates the direction of the current that once flowed over it.\r\nA portion of the bed is covered with sand and gravel, and along its\r\nborder are gravel terraces resting on ice. These occurrences\r\nillustrate the fact that rivers flowing through channels of ice are\r\ngoverned by the same general laws as the more familiar surface\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nAfter examining this glacial river, during our first excursion on the\r\nLucia glacier, we reached its western banks by crossing {108} above\r\nthe upper archway. Traversing the sand plain to the westward, we came\r\nto another stream of nearly equal interest, flowing along the western\r\nmargin of the glacier, past the end of the deep gorge called Floral\r\npass. A small creek, flowing down the pass, joins the stream and\r\nskirts the glacier just below the mouth of a wild gorge on the side of\r\nthe main valley. This stream once flowed along the border of the Lucia\r\nglacier when it was much higher than now, and began the excavation of\r\na channel in the rock, which was retained after the surface of the\r\nglacier was lowered by melting. It still flows in a rock-cut channel\r\nfor about a mile before descending to the border of the glacier as it\r\nexists at present. The geologist will see at once that this is a\r\npeculiar example of superimposed drainage. The gorge cut by the stream\r\nis a deep narrow trench with rough angular cliffs on either side, and\r\nis a good example of a water-cut cañon. When the Lucia glacier melts\r\naway and leaves the broad-bottomed valley clear of ice, the deep\r\nnarrow gorge on its western side, running parallel with its longer\r\naxes, but a thousand feet or more above its bottom, will remain as one\r\nof the evidences of a former ice invasion.\r\n\r\nDuring our reconnoissance we turned back at the margin of the second\r\nriver, but a day or two later reached the same point with the camp\r\nhands and camping outfit, and, placing a rope from bank to bank,\r\neffected a crossing. Our next camp was in Floral pass. From there we\r\noccupied a topographical station on the summit of the Floral hills,\r\nand made another reconnoissance ahead, across the _Hayden\r\nglacier_,[28] to the next mountain spur.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Named in honor of the late Dr. Ferdinand V. Hayden,\r\nfounder of the United States Geological Survey of the Territories.]\r\n\r\nFloral pass, like so many of the topographical features examined\r\nduring the recent expedition, has a peculiar history. It is a\r\ncomparatively low-grade gorge leading directly across the end of an\r\nangular mountain range forming one of the spurs of Mount Cook. The\r\nposition of the pass was determined by an east-and-west fault and by\r\nthe erosion of soft shales turned up on edge along the line of\r\ndisplacement. At its head it is shut in by the Hayden glacier, which\r\nflows past it and forms a wall of ice about two hundred feet high. The\r\nwater flowing out from beneath the side of the glacier forms a muddy\r\ncreek, which finds its way over a bowlder-covered bed in the bottom of\r\nthe gorge to the border of Lucia glacier. Along the sides of the gorge\r\nthere are {109} many terraces, which record a complicated history.\r\nEvenly stratified clays near its lower end, adjacent to the Lucia\r\nglacier, show that it was at one time occupied in part by a lake.\r\nAbove the lacustral beds there are water-worn deposits, indicating\r\nthat at a later date the gorge was filled from side to side by\r\nmoraines and coarse stream deposits several hundred feet thick. These\r\nwere excavated, and portions were left clinging to the hill-sides,\r\nforming the terraces of to-day. Diverse slopes in the terraces suggest\r\nthat the drainage may at times have been reversed, according as the\r\nLucia or the Hayden glacier was the higher.\r\n\r\nThe routes between our various camps, scattered along between Yakutat\r\nbay and Blossom island, were traversed several times by every member\r\nof the party. To traverse the same trail several times with heavy\r\nloads, and perhaps in rain and mist, is disheartening work which I\r\nwill spare the reader the effort of following even in fancy.\r\n\r\nFrom our camp in Floral pass another reconnoissance ahead was made by\r\nMr. Kerr and myself, as already mentioned. These advances, each one of\r\nwhich told us something new, were the most interesting portions of our\r\njourney. The little adventures and experiences of each advance were\r\nreported and talked over when we rejoined our companions around the\r\ncamp-fire at night, and were received with gratifying interest by the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nA view of the Hayden glacier from the Floral hills showed us that it\r\ndiffered from any of the glaciers previously traversed. Its surface,\r\nwhere we planned to cross it, was free of débris except along the\r\nmargins and also near the center, where we could distinguish a light\r\nmedial moraine. Farther southward, near the terminus of the glacier,\r\nits surface from side to side was buried beneath a sheet of stones and\r\ndirt. As in many other instances, the débris on the lower portion of\r\nthe glacier has been concentrated at the surface, owing to the melting\r\nof the ice, so as to form a continuous sheet.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning, while traveling over the torrent-swept bowlders in\r\nthe stream-bed on our way up Floral pass, we were a little startled at\r\nseeing the head of a bear just visible through the flowers fringing\r\nthe bank. Before a shot could be fired, he vanished, and remained\r\nperfectly quiet among the bushes for several minutes. But a trembling\r\nof the branches at length betrayed his presence, and a few minutes\r\nlater he came out in full view, his yellow-brown coat giving him the\r\nappearance of a huge {110} dog. Standing on a rounded mound he looked\r\ninquiringly down the valley, with his shaggy side in full view. I\r\nfired--but missed my aim. The unsuccessful hunter always has an excuse\r\nfor his failure; I had never before used the rifle I carried, and the\r\nhair-trigger with which it was provided deceived me. Fortunately for\r\nthe bear, and probably still more fortunately for me, the bullet went\r\nfar above the mark. The huge beast vanished again, although the\r\nvegetation was not dense, and left us wondering how such a large\r\nanimal could disappear so quickly and so completely in such an open\r\nregion. On searching for his tracks, we found that he had traversed\r\nfor a few rods the plant-covered terrace on which he was first\r\ndiscovered, and then escaped up a lateral gorge to a broader terrace\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nReaching the head of the Floral pass and climbing the hill of débris\r\nbordering the Hayden glacier, we came out upon the clear, white ice of\r\nthe central portion of the ice-stream. The ice was greatly crevassed,\r\nbut nearly all the gaps in its surface could be crossed by jumping or\r\nelse by ice-bridges. The most interesting feature presented by the\r\nglacier was the way in which it yields itself to the inequality of the\r\nrocks over which it flows. Starting on the eastern side, below the\r\nentrance to Floral pass, and extending northwestward diagonally across\r\nthe stream, there is a line of steep descent in the rocks beneath,\r\nwhich causes the ice to be greatly broken. This is not properly an\r\nice-fall, except near the confining walls of the cañon; but it might\r\nbe called an ice-rapid. The ice bends down over the subglacial scarp\r\nwith many long breaks, but does not form pinnacles, as in many similar\r\ninstances where the descent is greater, and true ice cascades occur.\r\nThe most practicable way for crossing the glacier was to ascend the\r\nstream above the line of rapids for some distance, and then follow\r\ndiagonally down its center, finally veering westward to the opposite\r\nbank. By following this course, and making a double curve like the\r\nletter S, we could cross the steep descent in the center, where it was\r\nleast crevassed.\r\n\r\nThe marginal moraines on the Hayden glacier are formed of fragments of\r\nbrown and gray sandstone and black shale of all sizes and shapes. It\r\nis clear that this débris was gathered by the cliffs bordering the\r\nglacier on either side. The medial moraine which first appears at the\r\nsurface just above the rapids is of a different character, and tells\r\nthat the higher peaks of Mount Cook are composed, in part at least, of\r\na different material from {111} the spurs projecting from it. The\r\nmedial moraine looks black from a distance, but, on traversing it, it\r\nwas found to be composed mainly of dark-green gabbro and serpentine.\r\nThe débris is scattered over the surface in a belt several rods wide;\r\nbut it is not deep, as the ice can almost everywhere be seen between\r\nthe stones. Where the fragments of rock are most widely separated,\r\nthere are fine illustrations of the manner in which small, dark stones\r\nabsorb the heat of the sun and melt the ice beneath more rapidly than\r\nthe surrounding surface, sinking into the ice so as to form little\r\nwells, several inches deep, filled with clear water. Larger stones,\r\nwhich are not warmed through during a day's sunshine, protect the ice\r\nbeneath while the adjacent surface is melted, and consequently become\r\nelevated on pillars or pedestals of ice. The stones thus elevated are\r\nfrequently large, and form tables which are nearly always inclined\r\nsouthward. In other instances the ice over large areas, especially\r\nalong the center of the medial moraine, was covered with cones of\r\nfine, angular fragments from a few inches to three or four feet in\r\nheight. These were not really piles of gravel, as they seemed, but\r\nconsisted of cones of ice, sheeted over with thin layers of small\r\nstones. The secret of their formation, long since discovered on the\r\nglaciers of Switzerland, is that the gravel is first concentrated in a\r\nhole in the ice and, as the general surface melts away, acts like a\r\nlarge stone and protects the ice beneath. It is raised on a pedestal,\r\nbut the gravel at the borders continually rolls down the sides and a\r\nconical form is the result.\r\n\r\nWhere we crossed the Hayden glacier it is only about a mile broad in a\r\ndirect line; but to traverse it by the circuitous route rendered\r\nnecessary by the character of its surface required about three hours\r\nof hard tramping, even when unincumbered with packs. From the center\r\nof the glacier a magnificent view may be obtained of the snow-covered\r\ndomes of Mount Cook, from which rugged mountain ridges stretch\r\nsouthward like great arms and enclose the white snow-field from which\r\nthe glacier flows. At an elevation of 2,500 feet the icy portion\r\ndisappears beneath the névé on which not a trace of débris is visible.\r\nAll the higher portions of the mountains are white as snow can make\r\nthem, except where the pinnacles and precipices are too steep to\r\nretain a covering.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the western side of the glacier we found a bare space on\r\nthe bordering cliffs, about a hundred feet high, which {112} has been\r\nabandoned by the ice so recently that it is not yet grassed over.\r\nAbove this came the luxuriant and beautiful vegetation covering all\r\nthe lower mountain slopes.\r\n\r\nThe mountain spur just west of the glacier, like several of the ridges\r\nstretching southward from the higher mountains, ends in a group of\r\nhills somewhat separate from the main ridge. The hills are covered\r\nwith a rank vegetation, and in places support a dense growth of spruce\r\ntrees. Reaching the grassy summit, we had a fine, far-reaching view of\r\nthe unexplored region toward the west, and of the vast plateau of ice\r\nstretching southward beyond the reach of the vision. West of our\r\nstation, another great ice-stream, named the _Marvine glacier_, in\r\nhonor of the late A. R. Marvine, flows southward with a breadth\r\nexceeding that of any of the icy streams yet crossed. Beyond the\r\nMarvine glacier, and forming its western border, there is an\r\nexceedingly rugged mountain range trending northeast and southwest.\r\nAlthough this is, topographically, a portion of the mountain mass\r\nforming Mount Cook, its prominence and its peculiar geological\r\nstructure render it important that it should have an independent name.\r\nIn acknowledgment of the services to science rendered by the first\r\nstate geologist of Massachusetts, it is designated the _Hitchcock\r\nrange_ on our maps. Rising above the angular crest line of this\r\nmountain mass towers the pyramidal summit of Mount St. Elias,\r\nseemingly as distant as when we first beheld it from near Yakutat bay.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile west of the hill on which we stood, and beyond the bed of\r\na lake now drained of its waters by a tunnel leading southward through\r\nthe ice, rose a steep, rocky island out of the glaciers, its summit\r\novergrown with vegetation and dark with spruce trees. This oasis in a\r\nsea of ice, subsequently named Blossom island, we chose as the most\r\nfavorable site for our next advance-camp.\r\n\r\nWe then returned to our camp in Floral pass, and a day or two later\r\nKerr and Christie started on a side trip up the Hayden glacier, to be\r\nabsent five days. During this trip the weather was stormy, and only\r\nallowed half an hour for topographical work when a somewhat favorable\r\nstation was reached. This was of great service, however, in mapping\r\nthe country, as it gave a station of considerable elevation on the\r\nside of Mount Cook. The trip was nearly all above the snow-line, and\r\nwas relieved by many novel experiences.\r\n\r\n{113} While Kerr and Christie were away, I assisted the camp hands in\r\nadvancing to Blossom island. Our first day's work consisted in packing\r\nloads across the Hayden glacier to the wooded hills on its western\r\nborder, reached during the reconnoissance described above. The weather\r\nwas stormy, and a dense fog rolled in from the ocean, obscuring the\r\nmountains, and compelling us to find our way across the glacier as\r\nbest we could without landmarks. Patiently threading our way among\r\ncrevasses, we at length came in sight of the forests on the extremity\r\nof the mountain spur toward the west, and concluded to camp there\r\nuntil the weather was more favorable. We climbed the bare slope\r\nbordering the glacier, and forced our way through the dripping\r\nvegetation to an open space beside a little stream and near some aged\r\nspruce trees that would furnish good fuel for a camp-fire. We were\r\nglad of a refuge, but did not fully appreciate the fact that our tents\r\nwere in a paradise of flowers until the next morning, when the sun\r\nshone clear and bright for a few hours. We hailed with delight the\r\nworld of summer beauty with which we were surrounded. Our camp was in\r\na little valley amid irregular hills of débris left by the former ice\r\ninvasion, each of which was a rounded dome of flowers. The desolate\r\nice-fields were completely shut out from view by the rank vegetation.\r\nOn the slope above us, dark spruce trees loaded with streamers of\r\nmoss, and seemingly many centuries old, formed a background for the\r\nfloral decoration with which the ground was everywhere covered.\r\nFlowering plants and ferns were massed in such dense luxuriance that\r\nthe streams were lost in gorgeous banks of bloom.\r\n\r\nReluctantly we returned to Floral pass for another load of camp\r\nsupplies, and late in the afternoon pressed on to Blossom island,\r\nwhere we again pitched our tents in rain and mist, and again, when the\r\nstorm cleared away, found ourselves in an untrodden paradise. Kerr and\r\nChristie rejoined us at Blossom island on July 31, and we were once\r\nmore ready for an advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOSSOM ISLAND.\r\n\r\nOur camp on Blossom island was near a small pond of water and close\r\nbeside a thick grove of spruce trees on the western side of the\r\nland-mass. The tents were so placed as to secure an unobstructed view\r\nto the westward; and they were visible, in turn, to parties descending\r\nfrom the mountains toward the northwest, whither our work soon led us.\r\n\r\n{114} The sides of Blossom island are rough and precipitous. The\r\nglaciers flowing past it cut away the rocks and, as the surface of the\r\nice-fields was lowered, left them in many places in rugged cliffs bare\r\nof vegetation. The top of the island was also formerly glaciated and\r\nin part covered with débris; but the ice retreated so long ago that\r\nthe once desolate surface has become clothed in verdure. Everywhere\r\nthere are dense growths of flowers, ferns and berry bushes. On the\r\nrocky spurs, thrifty spruce trees, festooned with drooping streamers,\r\nshelter luxuriant banks of mosses, lichens and ferns. There was no\r\nevidence that human hand had ever plucked a flower in that luxuriant\r\ngarden; not a trace could be found of man's previous invasion. The\r\nonly trails were those left by the bears in forcing their way through\r\nthe dense vegetation in quest of succulent roots. Later in the season,\r\nwhen the berries ripened, there was a feast spread invitingly for all\r\nwho chose to partake. On the warm summer days the air was filled with\r\nthe perfume of the flowers, birds flitted in and out of the shady\r\ngrove, and insects hummed in the glad sunlight; the freshness and\r\nbeauty on every hand made this island seem a little Eden, preserved\r\nwith all its freshness and fragrance from the destroying hand of man.\r\n\r\nThis oasis in a desert of ice is so beautiful and displays so many\r\ninstructive and attractive features that I wish the reader to come\r\nwith me up the flowery slopes and study the interesting pictures to be\r\nseen from its summit.\r\n\r\nThe narrow ravine back of our camp is festooned and overhung with tall\r\nferns, shooting out from the thickets on either hand like bending\r\nplumes. You will notice at a glance, if perchance your youthful\r\nexcursions happened to be in the northeastern states, as were mine,\r\nthat many of the plants about us are old friends, or at least former\r\nacquaintances. The tall fern nodding so gracefully as we pass is an\r\n_Asplenium_, but of ranker growth than in most southern regions. These\r\ntall white flowers with aspiring, flat-topped umbels, looking like\r\nrank caraway plants, but larger and more showy, belong to the genus\r\n_Archangelica_, and are at home in the Cascade range and the Rocky\r\nMountains as well as here. The lily-like plant growing so profusely,\r\nespecially in the moist dells, with tall, slim spikes of greenish\r\nflowers and long parallel veined leaves, is _Veratrum viride_. These\r\nbrilliant yellow monkey-flowers, bending so gracefully over the banks\r\nof the pond, are closely related to the little {115} _Mimulus_ which\r\nnods to its own golden reflection in many of the brooks of New\r\nEngland. That purple _Epilobrum_, with now and then a pure white\r\nvariety, so common everywhere on these hills, is the same wanderer\r\nthat we have seen over many square miles beneath the burnt woods of\r\nMaine. These bushes with obscure white flowers, looking like little\r\nwaxen bells, we recognize at once as huckleberries; in a short time\r\nthey will be loaded with luscious fruit. Inviting couches of moss\r\nbeneath the spruce trees are festooned and decorated with fairy shapes\r\nof brown and green, that recall many a long ramble among the\r\nAdirondack hills and in the Canadian woods. The licapods, equiseta and\r\nferns are many of them identical with the tracery on mossy mounds\r\ncovering fallen hemlocks in the Otsego woods in New York, but display\r\ngreater luxuriance and fresher and more brilliant colors. That\r\ngraceful little beach-fern, here and there faded to a rich brown,\r\nforetelling of future changes, is identical with the little fairy form\r\nwe used to gather long ago along the borders of the Great Lakes.\r\nAsters and gentians, delicate orchids and purple lupines, besides many\r\nless familiar plants, crowd the hillsides and deck the unkept meadows\r\nwith a brilliant mass of varied light. In the full sunshine, the\r\nhill-slopes appear as if the fields of petals clothing them had the\r\nprism's power, and were spreading a web of rainbow tints over the lush\r\nleaves and grasses below.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn our return to Blossom island, late in September, we found many of\r\nthe flowers faded, but in their places there was a profusion of\r\nberries nearly as brilliant in color as the petals that heralded their\r\ncoming. Many of the thickets, inconspicuous before, had then a deep,\r\nrich yellow tint, due to an abundance of luscious salmon berries,\r\nlarger than our largest blackberries. The huckleberries were also\r\nripe, and in wonderful profusion. These additions to our table were\r\nespecially appreciated after living for more than a month in the snow.\r\nThe ash trees were holding aloft great bunches of scarlet berries,\r\neven deeper and richer in color than the ripe leaves on the same\r\nbrilliant branches. The deep woods were brilliant with the broad\r\nyellow leaves of the Devil's club, above which rose spikes of crimson\r\nberries. The dense thickets of currant bushes, so luxuriant that it\r\nwas difficult to force one's way through them, had received a dusky,\r\nsmoke-like tint, due to abundant blue-black strings of fruit suspended\r\nall along the under sides of the branches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{116} Let us not look too far ahead, however. Wandering on over the\r\nsunny slopes, where the gardener has forgotten to separate the colors\r\nor to divide the flower banks, we gain the top of the island; but so\r\ndense are the plants about us, and so eager is each painted cup to\r\nexpand freely in the sunlight at the expense of its neighbors, that we\r\nhave to beat them down with our alpenstocks--much as we dislike to mar\r\nthe beauty of the place--before we can recline on the thick turf\r\nbeneath and study the strange landscape before us.\r\n\r\nThe foreground of every view is a bank of flowers nodding and swaying\r\nin the wind, but all beyond is a frozen desert. The ice-fields before\r\nus, with their dark bands of débris, are a picture of desolation. The\r\ncreative breath has touched only the garden which we, the first of\r\nwanderers, have invaded. The land before us is entirely without human\r\nassociations. No battles have there been fought, no kings have ruled,\r\nno poets have sung of its ruggedness, and no philosopher has explained\r\nits secrets. Yet it has its history, its poetry, and its philosophy!\r\n\r\nThe mountains toward the north are too near at hand to reveal their\r\ngrandeur; only the borders of the vast snow-fields covering all of\r\nthese upper slopes are in view. In the deep cañon with perpendicular\r\nwalls, just north of our station, but curving westward so that its\r\nupper course is concealed from view, there flows a secondary glacier\r\nwhich forces its terminal moraine high up on the northern slope of\r\nBlossom island, but does not now join the ice-field on the south.\r\nStreams of turbid water flow from this glacier on each side of the\r\noasis on which we stand and unite at the mouth of a dark tunnel in the\r\nice toward the south.\r\n\r\nThe barren gravel plain just east of our station, and at the foot of\r\nthe glacier from the north, is the bed of a glacial lake which has\r\nbeen drained through the tunnel in the ice. On our way to Blossom\r\nisland we crossed this area and found that it had but recently lost\r\nits waters. Miniature terraces on the gravel banks forming the sides\r\nof the basin marked the height to which the waters last rose, and all\r\nthe slopes formerly submerged were covered with a thin layer of\r\nsediment. On the sides of the basin where this fresh lining rests on\r\nsteep slopes there are beautiful frettings made by rills in the soft\r\nsediment. The stream from the glacier now meanders across this sand\r\nplain, dividing as it goes into many branches, which unite on {117}\r\napproaching the dark archway below. The lake is extremely irregular in\r\nits behavior, and may be filled and emptied several times in a season.\r\nThe waters are either restrained or flow freely, according as the\r\ntunnel through which they discharge is obstructed or open. The lake is\r\ntypical of a class. Similar basins may be found about many of the\r\nspurs projecting into the Malaspina glacier.\r\n\r\nA little west of the glacier to which I have directed your attention\r\nthere is a narrow mountain gorge occupied by another glacier, of small\r\nsize but having all the principal characteristics of even the largest\r\nAlpine glaciers of the region. It is less than half a mile in length,\r\nhas a high grade, and is fed by several lateral branches. Its surface\r\nis divided into an ice region below and a névé region above. It has\r\nlateral and medial moraines, ice pinnacles, crevasses, and many other\r\ndetails peculiar to glaciers. From its extremity, which is dark with\r\ndirt and stones, there flows a stream of turbid water. It is, in fact,\r\na miniature similitude of the ice-streams on the neighboring mountain,\r\nsome of which are forty or fifty miles in length and many times wider\r\nin their narrowest part than the little glacier before us is long. The\r\nmore thoroughly we become acquainted with the mountains of southern\r\nAlaska the more interesting and more numerous do the Alpine glaciers\r\nof the third order become. Already, thousands could be enumerated.\r\n\r\nI will not detain my imaginary companion longer with local details,\r\nbut turn at once to the objects which will ever be the center of\r\nattraction to visitors who may chance to reach this remote island in\r\nthe ice. Looking far up the Marvine glacier, beyond the tapering\r\npinnacles and rugged peaks about its head, you will see spires and\r\ncathedral-like forms of the purest white projected against the\r\nnorthern sky. They recall at once the ecclesiastic architecture of the\r\nOld World; but instead of being dim and faded by time they seem built\r\nof immaculate marble. They have a grandeur and repose seen only in\r\nmountains of the first magnitude. The cathedral to the right, with the\r\nlong roof-like crest and a tapering spire at its eastern terminus, is\r\nMount Augusta; its elevation is over 13,000 feet. A little to the\r\nwest, and equally beautiful but slightly less in elevation, is Mount\r\nMalaspina--a worthy monument to the unfortunate navigator whose name\r\nit bears. These peaks are on the main St. Elias range, but from our\r\npresent point of view they form only the {118} background of a\r\nmagnificent picture. Later in the season our tents were pitched at\r\ntheir very bases, and they then revealed their full grandeur and\r\nfulfilled every promise given by distant views.\r\n\r\nThe rugged Hitchcock range bordering the distant margin of the Marvine\r\nglacier, like the mountains near at hand and the rocky island on which\r\nwe stand, is composed of sandstone and shale, but presents one\r\ninteresting feature, to which I shall direct your attention. The trend\r\nof the range is northeast and southwest, but the strata of which it is\r\ncomposed run east and west and are inclined northward. As the range is\r\nsome eight miles long, these conditions would seem to indicate a\r\nthickness of many thousands of feet for the rocks of which it is\r\ncomposed; yet the beds were deposited in horizontal sheets of sand and\r\nmud of very late date, as will be shown farther on. But the great\r\napparent thickness of the strata is deceptive: a nearer examination\r\nwould reveal the fact that the rocks have been so greatly crushed that\r\neven a hand specimen can scarcely be broken off with fresh surfaces.\r\nMore than this, the black shale, exhibiting the greatest amount of\r\ncrushing, is usually in wedge-shaped masses, which, in some cases at\r\nleast, are bordered by what are known as thrust planes, nearly\r\ncoinciding with the bedding planes of the strata. The rocks have been\r\nfractured and crushed together in such a way as to pile fragments of\r\nthe same layer on top of each other, and thus to increase greatly\r\ntheir apparent thickness. In the elevations before us the thrust\r\nplanes are tipped northeastwardly, and it would seem that the force\r\nthat produced them acted from that direction. The apparent thickness\r\nof the beds has thus been increased many times. What their original\r\nthickness was, it is not now possible to say. Similar indications of a\r\nlateral crushing in the rocks may be found in several of the mountain\r\nspurs between the Hitchcock range and Yakutat bay; but space will not\r\npermit me to follow this subject further.\r\n\r\nTurning from the mountains, we direct our eyes seaward; but it is a\r\nsea of ice that meets our view and not the blue Pacific. Far as the\r\neye can reach toward the west, toward the south, and toward the\r\nsoutheast there is nothing in view but a vast plateau of ice or barren\r\ndébris fields resting on ice and concealing it from view. This is the\r\nMalaspina glacier.\r\n\r\nOn the border of the ice, just below the cliffs on which we {119}\r\nstand, there is a belt of débris perhaps five miles in breadth, which\r\nalmost completely conceals the ice beneath. Portions of this moraine\r\nare covered by vegetation, and in places it is brilliant with flowers.\r\nThe vegetation is most abundant on the nearer border and fades away\r\ntoward the center of the glacier. Its distant border, adjacent to the\r\nwhite ice-field beyond, is {120} absolutely bare and desolate. An\r\nattempt has been made to reproduce this scene in the picture forming\r\nplate 16. The drawing is from a photograph and shows the barren débris\r\nfield stretching away towards the southwest. The extreme southern end\r\nof the Hitchcock range appears at the right. In the distance is the\r\nwhite ice of the central part of the Malaspina glacier. Far beyond,\r\nfaintly outlined against the sky, are the snow-covered hills west of\r\nIcy bay. The flowers in the foreground are growing on the crest of the\r\nsteep bluff bordering Blossom island on the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 16: MALASPINA GLACIER, FROM BLOSSOM ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nOn the moraine-covered portion, especially where plants have taken\r\nroot, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of lakelets occupying\r\nkettle-shaped depressions. A view of one of these interesting\r\nreservoirs in the ice is given in figure 2. If we should go down to\r\nthe glacier and examine such a lakelet near at hand, we should find\r\nthat the cliffs of ice surrounding them are usually unsymmetrical,\r\nbeing especially steep and rugged on one side and low or perhaps\r\nwanting entirely on the other. But there is no regularity in this\r\nrespect; the steep slopes may face in any direction. On bright days\r\nthe encircling walls are always dripping with water produced by the\r\nmelting of the ice; little rills are constantly flowing down their\r\nsides and plunging in miniature cataracts into the lake below; the\r\nstones at the top of the ice-cliffs, belonging to the general sheet of\r\ndébris covering the glacier, are continually being undermined and\r\nprecipitated into the water. A curious fact in reference to the walls\r\nof the lakelets is that the melting of the ice below the surface is\r\nmore rapid than above, where it is exposed to the direct rays of the\r\nsun. As a result the depressions have the form of an hour-glass, as\r\nindicated in the accompanying section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2--_View of a glacial Lakelet_ (_drawn from a\r\nPhotograph_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 3--_Section of a glacial lakelet_.]\r\n\r\nBeyond the bordering moraines at our feet, we can look far out over\r\nthe ice-plateau and view hundreds of square miles of its {121} frozen\r\nsurface. At the same time we obtain glimpses of other vast ice-fields\r\ntoward the west, beyond Icy bay; but their limits in that direction\r\nare unknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater in the season I made an excursion far out on the Malaspina\r\nglacier from the extreme southern end of the Hitchcock range, and\r\nbecame acquainted with many of its peculiarities. Its surface, instead\r\nof being a smooth snow-field, as it appears from a distance, is\r\nroughened by thousands of crevasses, many of which are filled with\r\nclear, blue water. Over hundreds of square miles the surface appears\r\nas if a giant plow had passed over it, leaving the ice furrowed with\r\ncrevasses. The crevasses are not broad; usually one can cross them at\r\na bound. They appear to be the scars left by rents in the tributary\r\nice-streams.\r\n\r\nThe stillness far out on the great ice-field is immediately noticed by\r\none who has recently traversed the sloping surfaces of the tributary\r\nglaciers. It is always silent on that vast frozen plateau. There are\r\nno surface streams and no lakes; not a rill murmurs along its channel\r\nof ice; no cascades are formed by streams plunging into moulins and\r\ncrevasses. The water produced by the melting of the ice finds its way\r\ndown into the glacier and perhaps to its bottom, and must there form\r\nrivers of large size; but no indications of their existence can be\r\nobtained at the surface. The icy surface is undulating, and resembles\r\nin some respects the great rolling prairies of the west; it is a\r\nprairie of ice. In the central portion not a shoot of vegetation casts\r\nits shadow, and scarcely a fragment of rock can be found. The\r\nboundaries of the vast plateau have never been surveyed, but its area\r\ncannot be less than five hundred square miles. The clear ice of the\r\ncenter greatly exceeds the extent of the moraine-covered borders. It\r\nhas a general elevation of fifteen or sixteen hundred feet, being\r\nhighest near the end of the Hitchcock range, where the Seward glacier\r\ncomes in, and decreasing from there in all directions. From the summit\r\nof Blossom island and other commanding stations it is evident that the\r\ndark moraine belts about its borders are compound and record a varied\r\nhistory. Far away toward the southeast the individual elements may be\r\ndistinguished. The dark bands of débris sweep around in great curves\r\nand concentric, swirl-like figures, which indicate that there are\r\ncomplicated currents in the seemingly motionless plateau.\r\n\r\nThe Malaspina glacier belongs to a class of ice bodies not {122}\r\npreviously recognized, which are formed at the bases of mountains by\r\nthe union of several glaciers from above. Their position suggests the\r\nname of _Piedmont glaciers_ for the type. They differ from continental\r\nglaciers in the fact that they are formed by the union of ice-streams\r\nand are not the sources from which ice-streams flow. The supply from\r\nthe tributary glacier is counterbalanced by melting and evaporation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the reader has become interested in the vast ice-fields about\r\nBlossom island, he may wish to continue our acquaintance and go with\r\nme into the great snow-fields on the higher mountains, where the\r\nice-rivers feeding the Malaspina glacier have their sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE ABOVE THE SNOW-LINE.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of August 2, all necessary preparations having\r\nbeen made the day previous, we started in the direction of the great\r\nsnow peak to be seen at the head of the Marvine glacier, where we\r\nhoped to find a pass leading through the mountains which would enable\r\nus to reach the foot of Mount St. Elias or to discover a practicable\r\nway across the main range into the unknown country toward the north.\r\n\r\nAll of the camp hands were with us at the start, except Stamy and\r\nWhite, who had been despatched to Port Mulgrave to purchase shoes. All\r\nbut Crumback and Lindsley were to return to Blossom island, however,\r\nafter leaving their loads at a rendezvous as far from Blossom island\r\nas could be reached in a day and allow sufficient time to return to\r\nthe base-camp. Kerr and myself, with the two camp hands mentioned,\r\nwere to press on to the snow-fields above. We took with us a tent,\r\nblankets, rations, an oil-stove, and a supply of coal oil, and felt\r\nequal to any emergency that might arise.\r\n\r\nThe morning of our departure was thick and foggy, with occasional\r\nshowers, and the weather grew worse instead of better as we advanced.\r\nAll the mountains were soon shut out from view by the vast vapor banks\r\nthat settled down from above, and we had little except the general\r\ncharacter of the glacier to guide us.\r\n\r\nOur way at first led up the eastern border of the Marvine glacier,\r\nover seemingly interminable fields of angular débris. Traveling on the\r\nrugged moraine, some idea of which may be obtained from plate 17, was\r\nnot only tiresome in the extreme, but ruinous to boots and shoes. On\r\npassing the mouth of the {123} first lateral gorge (about a mile from\r\nBlossom island), from which flows a secondary glacier, we could look\r\nup the bed of the steep ravine to the white precipices beyond, which\r\nseemed to descend out of the clouds, and were scarred by avalanches;\r\nbut all of the higher peaks were shrouded from view. At noon we passed\r\nthe mouth of a second and larger gorge, which discharges an important\r\ntributary. We then left the border of the glacier and traveled up its\r\ncenter, the crevasses at the embouchures of the tributary stream being\r\ntoo numerous and too wide to be crossed without great difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 17. MORAINES ON THE MARVINE GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nIn the center of the Marvine glacier there is a dark medial moraine,\r\ncomposed mainly of débris of gabbro and serpentine, of the same\r\ncharacter as the medial moraine on the Hayden glacier, already briefly\r\nmentioned. Here, too, we found broad areas covered with sand cones and\r\nglacial tables. There are also rushing streams, flowing in channels of\r\nice, which finally plunge into crevasses or in well-like moulins and\r\nsend back a deep roar from the caverns beneath. The murmurs of running\r\nwaters, heard on every hand, seem to indicate that the whole glacier\r\nis doomed to melt away in a single season.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon we reached the junction of the two main\r\nbranches of the Marvine glacier, and chose the most westerly. We were\r\nstill traveling over hard blue ice in which the blue and white\r\nvein-structure characteristic of glaciers could be plainly\r\ndistinguished. The borders of the ice-streams were dark with lateral\r\nmoraines; but after passing the last great tributary coming in from\r\nthe northeast we reached the upper limit of the glacier proper and\r\ncame to the lower border of the névé fields, above which there is\r\nlittle surface débris. The glacier there flows over a rugged descent,\r\nand is greatly broken by its fall. At first we endeavored to find a\r\npassage up the center of the crevassed and pinnacled ice, but soon\r\ncame to an impassable gulf. Turning toward the right, we traversed a\r\nridge of ice between profound gorges and reached the base of the\r\nmountain slope bordering the glacier on the east. Our party was now\r\ndivided; Christie and his companion were left searching for a\r\nconvenient place to leave the cans of rations they carried, while we,\r\nwho were to explore the regions above, were endeavoring to find a way\r\nup the ice-fall. A shout from our companions below called our\r\nattention to the fact that they were unable to reach the border of the\r\nglacier, where they had been directed to leave their packs, and that\r\nthey {124} had left them on the open ice. They waved us \"good-bye\" and\r\nstarted back toward Blossom island, leaving our little band of four to\r\nmake the advance.\r\n\r\nDescending into a deep black gorge at the border of the ice, formed by\r\nits melting back from the bordering cliffs, we clambered upward\r\nbeneath overhanging ice-walls, from which stones and fragments of ice\r\nwere occasionally dropping, and finally reached a great snow-bank on\r\nthe border of the glacier. As the storm still continued, and was even\r\nincreasing in force, we concluded to find a camping ground soon as\r\npossible and make ourselves comfortable as the circumstances would\r\npermit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST CAMP IN THE SNOW.\r\n\r\nWe had now reached the lower limit of perpetual snow. There were no\r\nmore moraines on the surface of the glacier, and no bare rock surfaces\r\nlarge enough to hold a tent. The entire region was snow-mantled as far\r\nas the eye could see, except where pinnacles and cliffs too steep and\r\nrugged for the snow to accumulate rose above the general surface. A\r\nlittle to one side of the mouth of a steep lateral gorge we found a\r\nspot in which a mass of partly disintegrated shale had fallen down\r\nfrom the cliff. We scraped the fragments aside, smoothed the snow\r\nbeneath, and built a wall of rock along the lower margin. The space\r\nabove was filled in with fragments of shale, so as to form a shelf on\r\nwhich to pitch our tent. Soon our blankets were spread, with our\r\nwater-proof coats for a substratum, and supper was prepared over the\r\noil-stove.\r\n\r\nDarkness settled down over the mountains, and the storm increased as\r\nthe night came on. What is unusual in Alaska, the rain fell in\r\ntorrents, as in the tropics. Our little tent of light cotton cloth\r\nafforded great protection, but the rain-drops beat on it with such\r\nforce that the spray was driven through and made a fine rain within.\r\nWeary with many hours of hard traveling over moraines and across\r\ncrevassed ice, and in an atmosphere saturated with moisture, we rolled\r\nourselves in our blankets, determined to rest in spite of the storm\r\nthat raged about.\r\n\r\nAs the rain became heavier, the avalanches, already alarmingly\r\nnumerous, became more and more frequent: A crash like thunder,\r\nfollowed by the clatter of falling stones, told that many tons of ice\r\nand rocks on the mountains to the westward had slid {125} down upon\r\nthe borders of the glacier; another roar near at hand, caused by an\r\navalanche on our own side of the glacier, was followed by another,\r\nanother, and still another out in the darkness, no one could tell\r\nwhere. The wilder the storm, the louder and more frequent became the\r\nthunder of the avalanches. It seemed as if pandemonium reigned on the\r\nmountains. One might fancy that the evil spirits of the hills had\r\nprepared for us a reception of their own liking--but decidedly not to\r\nthe taste of their visitors. Soon there was a clatter and whiz of\r\nstones at our door. Looking out I saw rocks as large as one's head\r\nbounding past within a few feet of our tent. The stones on the\r\nmountain side above had been loosened by the rain, and it was evident\r\nthat our perch was no longer tenable. Before we could remove our frail\r\nshelter to a place of greater safety, a falling rock struck the\r\nalpenstock to which the ridge-rope of our tent was fastened and\r\ncarried it away. Our tent \"went by the board,\" as a sailor would say,\r\nand we were left exposed to the pouring rain. Before we could gather\r\nup our blankets they were not only soaked, but a bushel or more of mud\r\nand stones from the bank above, previously held back by the tent,\r\nflowed in upon them. Rolling up our blankets and \"caching\" the\r\nrations, instruments, etc., under a rubber cloth held down by rocks,\r\nwe hastily dragged our tent-cloth down to the border of the glacier,\r\nat the extremity of a tapering ridge, along which it seemed impossible\r\nfor stones from above to travel. We there pitched our tent on the hard\r\nsnow, without the luxury of even a few handfuls of shale beneath our\r\nblankets. Wet and cold, we sought to wear the night away as best we\r\ncould, sleep being impossible. Crumback, who had been especially\r\nenergetic in removing the tent, regardless of his own exposure, was\r\nwet and became cold and silent. The oil-stove and a few rations were\r\nbrought from the cache at the abandoned camp, and soon a dish of\r\ncoffee was steaming and filling the tent with its delicious odor. Our\r\nshelter became comfortably warm and the hot coffee, acting as a\r\nstimulant, restored our sluggish circulation. We passed an\r\nuncomfortable night and watched anxiously for the dawn. Toward morning\r\na cold wind swept down the glacier and the rain ceased. With the dawn\r\nthere came indications that the storm had passed, although we were\r\nstill enveloped in dense clouds and could not decide whether or not a\r\nfavorable change in the weather had occurred. We were still cold and\r\nwet and the desire to return to Blossom {126} island, where all was\r\nsunshine and summer, was great. Uncertain as to what would be the\r\nwisest course, we packed our blankets and started slowly down the\r\nmountain, looking anxiously for signs that the storm had really\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nAn hour after sunrise a rift in the mist above us revealed the\r\nwonderful blue of the heavens, and allowed a flood of sunlight to pour\r\ndown upon the white fields beneath. Never was the August sun more\r\nwelcome. The mists vanished before its magic touch, leaving here and\r\nthere fleecy vapor-wreaths festooned along the mountain side; as the\r\nclouds disappeared, peak after peak came into view, and snow-domes and\r\nglaciers, never seen before, one by one revealed themselves to our\r\nastonished eyes. When the curtain was lifted we found ourselves in a\r\nnew world, more wild and rugged than any we had yet beheld. There was\r\nnot a tree in sight, and nothing to suggest green fields or flowery\r\nhill-sides, except on a few of the lower mountain spurs, where\r\nbrilliant Alpine blossoms added a touch of color to the pale\r\nlandscape. All else was stern, silent, motionless winter.\r\n\r\nThe glacier, clear and white, without a rock on its broken surface,\r\nlooked from a little distance like a vast snow-covered meadow. We were\r\nabout a mile above the lower limit of the snow-fields, where the blue\r\nice of the glacier comes out from beneath the névé. The blue ice was\r\ndeeply buried, and could only be seen in the deepest crevasses. Across\r\nthe glacier rose the angular cliffs and tapering spires of the\r\nHitchcock range. Every ravine and gulch in its rugged sides was\r\noccupied by glaciers, many of which were so broken and crevassed that\r\nthey looked like frozen cataracts.\r\n\r\nCheered by the bright skies and sun-warmed air, we pushed on up the\r\nglacier, taking the center of the stream in order to avoid the\r\ncrevasses, which were most numerous along its borders. Two or three\r\nmiles above our first camp we found a place where a thin layer of\r\nbroken shale covered the snow, at a sufficient distance from the steep\r\nslopes above to be out of the reach of avalanches. We there\r\nestablished our second camp after leaving Blossom island, dried our\r\nblankets, and spent the remainder of the day basking in the sunlight\r\nand gathering energy for coming emergencies.\r\n\r\nWe found the névé of the Marvine glacier differing greatly from the\r\nlower or icy portion previously traversed. Instead of ice with blue\r\nand white bands, as is common lower down, the {127} entire surface,\r\nand as far down in the crevasses as the eye could distinguish, was\r\ncomposed of compact snow, or snow changed to icy particles resembling\r\nhail and having in reality but few of the properties of ordinary snow:\r\nit might properly be called névé ice. Usually the thickness of the\r\nlayers varied from ten to fifteen feet. Separating them were dark\r\nlines formed by dust blown over the surface of the glacier and buried\r\nby subsequent snow-storms, or by thin blue lines formed by the edges\r\nof sheets of ice and showing that the snow surface had been melted\r\nduring bright sunny days and frozen again at night. The horizontal\r\nstratification so plainly marked in all the crevasses in the névé was\r\nalmost entirely wanting, or at least was not conspicuous, in the lower\r\nportion of the glacier, where, instead, we found those narrow blue and\r\nwhite bands already mentioned, the origin of which has been so well\r\ndescribed and explained by Tyndall.\r\n\r\nThe center of the Marvine glacier, as in most similar ice-streams, is\r\nhigher and less broken by crevasses than its borders. The crevasses at\r\nthe side trend up stream, as is the case with marginal crevasses\r\ngenerally. In the present instance the courses of these rents could be\r\nplainly distinguished on each border of the glacier, when looking down\r\nupon it from neighboring slopes. The crevasses occur at quite regular\r\nintervals of approximately fifty feet, and diverge from the bank at\r\nangles of about 40°. In the banks of snow bordering the glacier\r\nsimilar crevasses diverge from the margin of the flowing glacier and\r\ntrend down along its banks. The marginal crevasses and the crevasses\r\nin the bordering snow-fields, to which no special name has been given,\r\nfall nearly in line; but between the two there is a series of\r\nirregular cracks and broken snow, sharply defining the border of the\r\nmoving névé.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the marginal crevasses trending up stream was explained\r\nduring the study of the glaciers of Switzerland. The following diagram\r\nand explanation illustrating their development are copied from\r\nTyndall:\r\n\r\n\"Let _A C_ be one side of the glacier and _B D_ the other; and let the\r\ndirection of motion be that indicated by the arrow. Let _S T_ be a\r\ntransverse slice of the glacier, taken straight across it, say to-day.\r\nA few days or weeks hence the slice will have been carried down, and\r\nbecause the center moves more quickly than the sides it will not\r\nremain straight, but will bend into the form _S' T'_. Supposing _T i_\r\nto be a small square of the original slice near the side of the\r\nglacier; in the new position the square will be distorted to the\r\nlozenge-shaped figure _T' i'_. Fix your attention upon the {128}\r\ndiagonal _T i_ of the square; in the lower position this diagonal, _if\r\nthe ice could stretch_, would be lengthened to _T' i'_. But the ice\r\ndoes not stretch; it breaks, and we have a crevasse formed at right\r\nangles to _T' i'_. The mere inspection of the diagram will assure you\r\nthat the crevasse will point obliquely _upward_.\"[29]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4--_Diagram illustrating the Formation of\r\nmarginal Crevasses_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: The Forms of Water: International Scientific Series, New\r\nYork, 1875, pp. 107-108.]\r\n\r\nThe explanation given above applies especially to the lower or icy\r\nportion of a glacier; above the snow-line other facts appear. When a\r\nglacier flows through fields of snow on a level with its surface,\r\ncrevasses are formed in the adjacent banks. These trend down stream\r\nfor the same reason that the crevasses in the glacier proper trend up\r\nstream--that is, the friction of the moving stream against its banks\r\ntends to carry them along, while the portions at a distance are\r\nstationary. Fissures are thus opened which trend in the direction in\r\nwhich the glacier moves. The angle made by these crevasses with the\r\naxis of the glacier is about the same as those of the marginal\r\ncrevasses, but in an opposite direction. They are widest near the\r\nmargin of the glacier and taper to a sharp end towards the stationary\r\nsnow-banks above. The crevasses in the two series thus fall nearly in\r\nline, but are separated by a narrow band of irregularly broken snow,\r\nmarking the actual border of the glacier.[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Crevasses in snow-fields through which ice-streams flow\r\nwill be mentioned again in describing the Seward glacier.]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Blossom island the party was divided, and we began a new\r\nseries of numbers for our camp above the snow-line, although in this\r\nnarrative and on the accompanying map a single series of numbers for\r\nall the camps will be used. While in the field the camps in the snow\r\nwere usually termed, facetiously, \"sardine camps,\" in allusion to the\r\nuncomfortable manner in which we were packed in our tent at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n{129} ACROSS PINNACLE PASS.\r\n\r\nThe morning after reaching Camp 12 dawned gloriously bright. The night\r\nhad been cold, and a heavy frost had silenced every rill from the\r\nsnow-slopes above. The clear, bracing air gave us renewed energy and a\r\nfirmer desire to press on. Mr. Kerr and myself made an excursion\r\nahead, while Lindsley and Crumback brought up a load of supplies from\r\nthe cache left on the glacier below Camp 11.\r\n\r\nOn gaining the center of the Marvine glacier we had a magnificent view\r\ndown the broad ice-stream, bordered on either hand by towering,\r\nsnow-laden precipices, and changing, as the eye followed the downward\r\nslope, from pure white to brown and black in the distance. Far below\r\nwe could barely discern the wooded summit of Blossom island, beyond\r\nwhich stretched the seemingly limitless ice-fields of the Malaspina\r\nglacier. All about us the white slope reflected the sunlight with\r\npainful brilliancy, while the black moraines and forests below and the\r\nmists over the distant ocean, made it seem as if one was looking down\r\ninto a lower and darker world.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced toward the head of the glacier we found, as on several\r\nsubsequent occasions, that the nearer we approached the sources of an\r\nice-stream the easier our progress became. Following up the center of\r\nthe glacier, we learned that it curved toward the east; and after an\r\nhour or two of weary tramping we reached the great amphitheatre in\r\nwhich it has its source. All about us were rugged mountain slopes,\r\nheavily loaded with snow, and forming clear white cliffs from which\r\navalanches had descended. To the westward the wall of the amphitheatre\r\nwas broken, and it was apparent that we could cross its rim in that\r\ndirection. Pressing onward up the gently ascending slope, we came at\r\nlength to a gap in the mountains bordered on the north by a towering\r\ncliff fully a thousand feet high, and were rejoiced to find that the\r\nsnow surface on the opposite side of the divide inclined westward with\r\na grade as gentle as the one we had ascended. Looking far down the\r\nwestern snow-slope, we could see where it joined a large glacier\r\nflowing southward past the end of the great cliffs which extended\r\nwestward from the divide. The glacier we saw in the valley below is\r\ndesignated on our map as the _Seward glacier_, in honor of William H.\r\nSeward, the former Secretary of State, who negotiated the purchase of\r\nAlaska for the United States.\r\n\r\n{130} The pass we named _Pinnacle pass_, on account of the many\r\ntowering pinnacles overshadowing it. Its elevation is about four\r\nthousand feet, and at the summit it has a breadth of only two or three\r\nhundred feet. The snow on the divide is greatly crevassed, but a\r\nconvenient snow-bridge enabled us to cross without difficulty. The\r\ncrevasses increased in breadth with the advance of the season, and on\r\nreturning from our mountain trip in September we had to climb up on\r\nthe bordering cliff in order to pass the main crevasse at the summit.\r\nSome idea of the crevasses of this region may be obtained from the\r\nfollowing figure, drawn from a photograph taken on the western side of\r\nPinnacle pass, not far from the summit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5--_Crevasses on Pinnacle Pass; from a\r\nPhotograph_.]\r\n\r\nThe cliff on the north of Pinnacle pass is really a huge fault-scarp\r\nof recent date, intersecting stratified shale, limestone, and\r\nconglomerate, with a few thin coal-seams. The strata dip toward the\r\nnorth at a high angle, and present their broken edges in the great\r\ncliff rising above the pass. The cliffs extend westward from the pass,\r\nand retain a nearly horizontal crest line, but increase in height and\r\ngrandeur, owing to the downward grade of the glacier along their base.\r\nA mile to the westward their elevation is fully two thousand feet. The\r\ncliffs throughout are {131} almost everywhere bare of snow and too\r\nsteep and rugged to be scaled. They form a strongly drawn boundary\r\nline in the geology of the region, and furnish the key to the\r\nstructure and geological character of an extended area. All the rocks\r\nto the southward are sandstone and shale belonging to a well-defined\r\nseries, and differ materially from the rocks in the fault-scarp. I\r\nhave called the rocks toward the south, the _Yakutat system_, and\r\nthose exposed in the faces of the fault-scarp the _Pinnacle system_.\r\nDirectly north of Pinnacle pass, and at the base of Mount Owen, the\r\nrocks of the Yakutat system are exposed, and from their position and\r\nassociation it is evident that they are younger than the Pinnacle\r\nsystem and belong above it. If these conclusions are sustained by\r\nfuture investigation, they will carry with them certain deductions\r\nwhich are among the most remarkable in geological history. On the\r\ncrest of the Pinnacle pass cliffs I afterwards found strata containing\r\nfossil shells and leaves belonging to species still living. These\r\nrecords of animal and plant life show that not only were the rocks of\r\nthe Pinnacle system deposited since living species of mollusks and\r\nplants came into existence, but that the Yakutat system is still more\r\nrecent. More than this, the upheaval of the mountains, the formation\r\nof numerous fault-scarps, and the origin of the glaciers, have all\r\noccurred since Pliocene times.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Pinnacle pass left no question as to the route to be\r\ntraversed in order to reach the mountains to the westward. We returned\r\nto Camp 12, and the following day, with Crumback and Lindsley to\r\nassist us, advanced our camp across Pinnacle pass and far down the\r\nwestern snow-slope.\r\n\r\nThe day we crossed the pass was bright and clear in the morning, but\r\nclouds gathered around all the higher peaks about midday, vanishing\r\nagain at nightfall. As it was desirable to occupy, for topographic and\r\nother purposes, a station on the top of the cliffs overlooking\r\nPinnacle pass, we made an effort to reach the crest of the ridge by\r\nclimbing up the steep scarp just at the divide, where the cliffs are\r\nlowest. While Crumback returned to Camp 12 for an additional load and\r\nLindsley went ahead to discover a new camping place, Kerr and myself,\r\ntaking the necessary instruments, began the ascent; but we found it\r\nexceedingly difficult. The outcrops of shale in the lower portion of\r\nthe cliff furnished but poor foothold, and crumbled and broke away at\r\nevery step. Once my companion, losing his support, slid slowly {132}\r\ndown the slope in spite of vigorous efforts to hold on, and a rapid\r\ndescent in the yawning chasm below seemed inevitable, when, coming to\r\na slightly rougher surface, he was able to control his movements and\r\nto regain what had been lost. Climbing on, we came to the base of a\r\nvertical wall of shale several hundred feet high, and made a detour to\r\nthe left where a cascade plunged down a narrow channel. We ascended\r\nthe bed of the stream, which was sometimes so steep that the spray\r\ndashed over us, and reached the base of an overhanging cliff of\r\nconglomerate composed of well-worn pebbles. Above this rose a cliff of\r\nsnow fifty feet or more in height, which threatened to crash down in\r\navalanches at any moment. One small avalanche did occur during the\r\nascent, and scattered its spray in our faces. Had a heavy avalanche\r\nformed, our position would have been exceedingly dangerous; but by\r\ntaking advantage of every overhanging ledge, and watching for the\r\nleast sign of movement in the snow above, we reached without accident\r\na sheltered perch underneath an overhanging cliff near the base of the\r\nsnow. We then discovered that clouds were forming on all the high\r\nmountains, and shreds of vapor blown over the crest of the cliff above\r\ntold us that further efforts would be useless. Seeking a perch\r\nprotected from avalanches by an overhanging cliff, we had a splendid\r\nview far out over the sloping snow-plain toward the west and of the\r\nmountains bordering Pinnacle pass on the south. My notes written in\r\nthis commanding station read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Looking down from my perch I can plainly distinguish the undulations\r\nand crevasses in the broad snow-fields stretching westward from\r\nPinnacle pass. Each inequality in the rock beneath the glacier is\r\nreproduced in flowing and subdued outlines in the white surface above.\r\nThe positions of bosses and cliffs in the rock beneath are indicated\r\nby rounded domes and steep descents in the snow surface. About the\r\nlower sides of these inequalities there are in some cases concentric\r\nblue lines and in others radiating fissures, marking where the snow\r\nhas broken in making the descent. The side light shining from the\r\neastward down the long westerly slope reveals by its delicate shading\r\nthe presence of broad, terrace-like, transverse steps into which the\r\nstream is divided. Were the snow removed and the rock beneath exposed,\r\nwe should find broad terraces separated by scarps sweeping across the\r\nbed of the glacier from side to side. Similar terraces occur in\r\nglaciated cañons in the Rocky Mountains and {133} the Sierra Nevada,\r\nbut their origin has never been explained. The glacier is here at work\r\nsculpturing similar forms; but still it is impossible to understand\r\nhow the process is initiated.\r\n\r\n\"Right in front of us, and only a mile or two away, rise the cliffs,\r\nspires, and pinnacles of the Hitchcock range. Every ravine and\r\namphitheatre in the great mountain mass is deeply filled with snow,\r\nand the sharp angular crests look as if they had been thrust up\r\nthrough the general covering of white. The northern end of the range\r\nis clearly defined by the east-and-west fault to which Pinnacle pass\r\nowes its origin. The trend of the mighty cliffs on the southern face,\r\non which we have found a perch, is at right angles to the longer axis\r\nof the Hitchcock range, and marks its northern terminus both\r\ntopographically and geologically.\r\n\r\n\"There is not even a suggestion of vegetation in sight. The eye fails\r\nto detect a single dash of green or the glow of a single Alpine flower\r\nanywhere on the rugged slopes. A small avalanche from the snow-cliffs\r\nabove, cascading over the cliff which shelters me and only a few yards\r\naway, tells why the precipices are so bare and desolate: they have\r\nbeen swept clean by avalanches.\r\n\r\n\"Far down the western snow-slope I can distinguish crevasses and dirt\r\nbands in the Seward glacier, which flows southward past the range on\r\nwhich we sit. The marginal crevasses along the border of the glacier\r\ncan clearly be distinguished. As usual, they trend up-stream and,\r\nmeeting medial crevasses, break the surface of the glacier into\r\nthousands of pinnacles and tables. Along the center of the stream\r\nthere are V-shaped dirt bands, separated by crevasses, which point\r\ndown-stream and give the appearance of a rapid flow to the central\r\nportion of the glacier. From this distance its center has the\r\nappearance of 'watered' ribbon.\r\n\r\n\"A little toward the south of where the medial crevasses are most\r\nnumerous, and at a locality where two opposite mountain spurs force\r\nthe ice-stream through the comparatively narrow gorge, there is\r\nevidently an ice-fall, as the whole glacier from side to side\r\ndisappears from view. The appearance of Niagara when seen from the\r\nbanks of the river above the Horseshoe falls is suggested. Beyond this\r\nsilent cataract, the eye ranges far out over the broad, level surface\r\nof the Malaspina glacier, and traces the dark morainal ribbons\r\nstreaming away for miles from the mountain spurs among which they\r\noriginate. From the extreme {134} southern cape of the Samovar hills\r\nthere is a highly compound moraine-belt stretching away toward the\r\nsouth, and then dividing and curving both east and west. The central\r\nband of débris must be a mile broad. Along its eastern margin I can\r\ncount five lesser bands separated by narrow intervals of ice, and on\r\nthe farther side similar secondary bands are suggested, but the height\r\nof the central range almost completely conceals them from view. In the\r\ndistant tattered ends, however, their various divisions can be clearly\r\ntraced. Great swirls in the ice are there indicated by concentric\r\ncurves of débris on its surface.\r\n\r\n\"Still farther westward there are hills rising to the height of\r\nimpressive mountains, in which northward dipping rocks, apparently of\r\nsandstone and shale, similar to those forming the Hitchcock range, are\r\nplainly distinguishable. All the northern slopes of these hills are\r\ndeeply buried beneath a universal covering of snow evidently hundreds\r\nof feet thick, which is molded upon them so as to reveal every\r\nswelling dome and ravine in their rugged sides. Farther westward\r\nstill, beyond a dark headland apparently washed by the sea, there are\r\nother broad ice-fields of the same general character as the Malaspina\r\nglacier, which stretch away for miles and miles and blend in the dim\r\ndistance with the haze of the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"Just west of the Seward glacier, and in part forming its western\r\nshore, there are dark, rocky crests projecting through the universal\r\nice mantle, suggesting the lost mountains of Utah and Nevada which\r\nhave become deeply buried by the dusts of the desert. The character of\r\nthe sharp crests beyond the Seward glacier indicate that they are the\r\nupturned edges of fault-blocks similar to the one on which we are\r\nseated. Interesting geological records are there waiting an\r\ninterpreter. The vastness of the mountains and the snow-fields to be\r\nseen at a single glance from this point of view can scarcely be\r\nrealized. There are no familiar objects in sight with which to make\r\neye-measurements; the picture is on so grand a scale that it defies\r\nimagination's grasp.\"\r\n\r\nSearching the snow-sheet below with a field-glass, I discover a minute\r\nspot on the white surface. Its movement, slow but unmistakable,\r\nassures me that it is Lindsley returning from the site chosen for our\r\ncamp to-night. Although apparently near at hand, he forms but an\r\ninconspicuous speck on the vast snow-field.\r\n\r\n{135} Having learned all that I could of the geology of the cliff, and\r\nthe gathering clouds rendering it unnecessary to climb the summits\r\nabove, we descended with even more difficulty than we had encountered\r\non our way up, and met Lindsley as he reached the pass. Resuming our\r\npacks, we started on, knowing that Crumback would follow our trail;\r\nand after two hours' hard tramping over a snow surface rendered\r\nsomewhat soft by the heat of the day, but fortunately little\r\ncrevassed, we reached the place chosen for our camp. Crumback soon\r\njoined us, and we pitched our tent for the night. The place chosen was\r\non a little island of débris, the farthest out we could discover from\r\nthe base of the great cliff on the north. We judged that we should\r\nthere be safe from avalanches, although the screech and hiss of stones\r\nfalling from the cliff were heard many times during the night.\r\n\r\nLindsley and Crumback, on revisiting the site of our camp two days\r\nlater, found that a tremendous avalanche of snow and rocks had in the\r\nmean time fallen from the cliffs and ploughed its way out upon the\r\nglacier to within fifteen or twenty feet of where we had passed the\r\nnight. They remarked that if the avalanche had occurred while we were\r\nin camp, our tent would not have been reached, but that we should\r\nprobably have been scared to death by the roar.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST FULL VIEW OF ST. ELIAS.\r\n\r\nLeaving Crumback and Lindsley to make our camp as comfortable as\r\npossible, Kerr and I pressed on with the object of seeing all we could\r\nof the country ahead before the afternoon sunlight faded into\r\ntwilight. Mount St. Elias had been shut out from view, either by\r\nclouds or by intervening mountains, for several days; but it was\r\nevident that on approaching the end of the Pinnacle pass fault-scarp\r\nwe should behold it again, and comparatively near at hand.\r\n\r\nContinuing down the even snow-slope, in which there were but few\r\ncrevasses, the view became broader and broader as we advanced, and at\r\nlength the great pyramid forming the culminating summit of all the\r\nregion burst into full view. What a glorious sight! The great mountain\r\nseemed higher and grander and more regularly proportioned than any\r\npeak I had ever beheld before. The white plain formed by the Seward\r\nglacier gave an even foreground, broken by crevasses which, lessening\r\nin perspective, gave distance to the foot-hills forming the western\r\n{136} margin of the glacier. Far above the angular crest of the\r\nSamovar hills in the middle distance towered St. Elias, sharp and\r\nclear against the evening sky. Midway up the final slope a thin,\r\nhorizontal bar of gray clouds was delicately penciled. Through the\r\nmeshes of the fairy scarf shone the yellow sunset sky. The strong\r\noutlines of the rugged mountain, which had withstood centuries of\r\nstorms and earthquakes, were softened and glorified by the breath of\r\nthe summer winds, chilled as they kissed its crystal slopes.\r\n\r\nCould I give to the reader a tithe of the impressions that such a view\r\nsuggests, they would declare that painters had never shown them\r\nmountains, but only hills. So majestic was St. Elias, with the halo of\r\nthe sunset about his brow, that other magnificent peaks now seen for\r\nthe first time or more fully revealed than ever before, although\r\nworthy the respect and homage of the most experienced\r\nmountain-climber, scarcely received a second glance.\r\n\r\nReturning to camp, we passed the night, and the following day, August\r\n6, advanced our camp to the eastern border of the Seward glacier at\r\nthe extreme western end of the upturned crest forming the northern\r\nwall of Pinnacle pass.\r\n\r\nThe western end of the Pinnacle pass cliff is turned abruptly\r\nnorthward, and the rocks dip eastward at a high angle, showing,\r\ntogether with other conditions, that the end of the ridge is\r\ndetermined by a cross-fault running northeast and southwest. West of\r\nthe Seward glacier there is a continuation of the Pinnacle-pass cliff,\r\nbut it is greatly out of line. The position of the Seward glacier, in\r\nthis portion of its course, was determined by the fault which broke\r\nthe alignment of the main displacement.\r\n\r\nMany facts of similar nature show that the glaciers of the St. Elias\r\nregion have had their courses determined, to a large extent, by the\r\nfaults which have given the region its characteristic structure: the\r\nice drainage is consequent to the structure of the underlying rocks;\r\nthe glaciers not only did not originate the channels in which they\r\nflow, but have failed to greatly modify them.\r\n\r\nCamp 14 was on a sharp crest of limestone, conglomerate, and shale\r\nbelonging to the Pinnacle system, which was not over ten feet broad\r\nwhere our tent was pitched. East of our tent there was a broad, upward\r\nsloping snow-plain banked against the precipitous base of a hill about\r\na thousand feet high. At the edge of the snow, within three feet of\r\nour tent, there was a pond {137} of clear water, seemingly placed\r\nthere for our special use. The western edge of our tent was at the\r\nmargin of a cliff about a hundred feet high, overlooking the Seward\r\nglacier. We held this camp for several days and reöccupied it on our\r\nreturn from St. Elias.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMIT OF PINNACLE PASS CLIFFS.\r\n\r\nFrom Camp 14 Crumback returned to Blossom island, and Stamy took his\r\nplace. Word from Christie assured me that supplies would be advanced\r\nto Blossom island, and that our cache on the Marvine glacier would be\r\nrenewed. Stamy's arrival was especially welcome for the reason that he\r\nbrought letters from dear ones far away, which had been forwarded from\r\nSitka by a trading schooner that chanced to visit Yakutat bay.\r\n\r\nWhile the camp hands were busy in bringing up fresh supplies, Kerr and\r\nI occupied two stations on the summit of the Pinnacle pass cliffs. One\r\nof these was on a butte at the western end of the ridge and just above\r\nour camp; the other was on the crest of the main line of cliffs almost\r\ndirectly above Pinnacle pass, at an elevation of 5,000 feet. Each of\r\nthe stations embraced magnificent views, extending from the outer\r\nmargin of the Malaspina glacier to the crest of the St. Elias range.\r\nThe station on the butte near camp was occupied several times, and\r\nproved to be a most convenient and commanding point for study of the\r\ngeography, geology, and distribution of glacier over a wide area. On\r\naccount of the splendid view obtained from the top we named it _Point\r\nGlorious_. Its elevation is 3,500 feet.\r\n\r\nOne of the days on which we occupied Point Glorious was especially\r\nremarkable on account of the clearness and freshness of the air and\r\nthe sharpness with which each peak and snow-crest stood out against\r\nthe deep-blue heavens. We left our camp early in the morning, and\r\nspent several hours on the summit. On our way up we found several\r\nlarge patches of Alpine flowers and, under a tussock of moss, a soft,\r\nwarm nest just abandoned by a mother ptarmigan with her brood of\r\nlittle ones. One hundred feet higher we came to the borders of the\r\nsnow-field which covered all of the upper slopes except a narrow crest\r\nof sandstone at the top.\r\n\r\nThe Seward glacier, sweeping down from the northeast, curves about the\r\nbase of Point Glorious and flows on southward. Its surface has the\r\nappearance of a wide frozen river. Toward the {138} east of our\r\nstation there was a broad, level-floored amphitheatre, bounded on the\r\nsouth by the cliffs of Pinnacle pass and on the east by long\r\nsnow-slopes which stretch up the gorges in the side of Mount Cook. The\r\namphitheatre opens toward the northwest, and discharges its\r\naccumulated snows into the Seward glacier. Beyond this, on the north,\r\nstood the great curtain-wall named the Corwin cliffs, west of which\r\nrose Mount Eaton, Mount Augusta, Mount Malaspina, and other giant\r\nsummits of the main St. Elias range. Toward the west the view\r\nculminated in St. Elias itself, ruggedly outlined against the sky. As\r\nthe reader will become more and more familiar with the magnificent\r\nscenery of the St. Elias region as we advance, it need not be\r\ndescribed in detail at this time.\r\n\r\nAll day the skies were clear and bright, giving abundant opportunity\r\nfor making a detailed survey of the principal features in view, and\r\nfor reading the history written in cliffs and glaciers. When the long\r\nsummer day drew to a close, we returned to our tent and watched the\r\ngreat peaks become dim and generalized in outline as the twilight\r\ndeepened. The fading light caused the mountains to recede farther and\r\nfarther, until at last they seemed ghostly giants, too far away to be\r\ndefinitely recognized. With the twilight came soft, gray, uncertain\r\nclouds drawn slowly and silently about the rugged precipices by the\r\nsummer winds from the sea. St. Elias became enveloped in luminous\r\nclouds, with the exception of a few hundred feet of the shining\r\nsummit; and a glory in the sky, to the left of the veiled Saint,\r\nmarked the place where the sun went down. The shadows crept across the\r\nsnow-fields and changed them from dazzling white to a soft gray-blue.\r\nNight came on silently, and with but little change. There was no\r\nfolding of wings; no twittering of birds in leafy branches; no sighing\r\nof winds among rustling leaves. All was stern and wild and still;\r\nthere was not a touch of life to relieve the desolation. A midwinter\r\nnight in inhabited lands was never more solemn. Man had never rested\r\nthere before.\r\n\r\nThe air grew chill when the shadows crossed our tent, and delicate ice\r\ncrystals began to shoot on the still surface of our little pond. We\r\nbade good night to the stern peaks, about which there were signs of a\r\ncoming storm, and sought the shelter of our tent. Small and\r\ncomfortless as was that shelter, it shut out the wintry scene and\r\nafforded a welcome retreat. Sound, refreshing sleep, with dreams of\r\nloved ones far away, renewed our strength for another advance.\r\n\r\n{139} The next day, August 8, a topographic station was occupied on\r\nthe summit of the Pinnacle pass cliffs. We were astir before sunrise,\r\nand had breakfast over before four o'clock. The morning was cold, and\r\na cutting wind swept down the Seward glacier from the northeast. All\r\nof the mountains were lost to view in dense clouds. A few rays of\r\nsunshine breaking through the vapor banks above Point Glorious gave\r\npromise of better weather during the day. Lindsley and Stamy had not\r\nyet returned from the lower camp, where they were to obtain additional\r\nrations; and Kerr and I concluded to try to reach the crest of the\r\nPinnacle pass cliffs and take the chances of the weather being\r\nfavorable for our work.\r\n\r\nLeaving camp in the early morning light, we chose to climb over the\r\nsummit of Point Glorious rather than thread the crevasses at its\r\nnorthern base. Reaching the top of the point, we were still beneath\r\nthe low canopy of clouds, and could see far up the great amphitheatre\r\nto the base of _Mount Owen_.[31] Descending the eastern slope, we soon\r\nreached the floor of the amphitheatre, and found the snow smooth and\r\nhard and not greatly crevassed. Cheered by faint promise of blue\r\nskies, we pressed on rapidly, the snow creaking beneath our tread as\r\non a winter morning. Two or three hours of rapid walking brought us to\r\nthe southern wall of the amphitheatre, nearly beneath the point we\r\nwished to occupy. As we ascended the slope the way became more\r\ndifficult, owing not only to its steepness but also to the fact that\r\nthe snow was softening, and also because great crevasses crossed our\r\npath. Looking back over the snow we had crossed, two\r\nwell-characterized features on its surface could be distinguished:\r\nthese were large areas with a gray tint, caused by a covering of dust.\r\nThis dust comes from the southern faces of the Pinnacle pass cliffs,\r\nand is blown over the crest of the ridge and scattered far and wide\r\nover the snow-fields toward the north. Should the dust-covered areas\r\nbecome buried beneath fresh snow, it is evident that the strata of\r\nsnow would be separated by thin layers of darker color. This is what\r\nhas happened many times, as we could see by looking down into the\r\ncrevasses. In one deep gulf I counted five distinct strata of clear\r\nwhite snow, separated by narrow dust-bands. In other instances there\r\nare twenty or more such strata visible. Each layer is evidently the\r\nrecord of a snow-storm, while the dust-bands indicate intervals of\r\nfine weather. {140} The strata of snow exposed to view in the\r\ncrevasses, after being greatly compressed, are usually from ten to\r\nfifteen feet thick, but in one instance exceeded fifty feet. If we\r\nassume that each layer represents a winter's snow, and that\r\ncompression has reduced each stratum to a third of its original\r\nthickness (and probably the compression has been greater than this),\r\nit is evident that the fresh snows must sometimes reach the depth of\r\nfrom 50 to 150 feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Named for David Dale Owen, United States geologist.]\r\n\r\nToiling on up the snow-slope, we had to wind in and out among deep\r\ncrevasses, sometimes crossing them by narrow snow-bridges, and again\r\njumping them and plunging our alpenstocks deep in the snow when we\r\nreached the farther side. After many windings we reached the summit of\r\nthe Pinnacle-pass cliffs. The crest-line is formed of an outcrop of\r\nconglomerate composed of sand and pebbles, in one layer of which I\r\nfound large quantities of mussel shells standing in the position in\r\nwhich the creatures lived. The present elevation of this ancient\r\nsea-bottom is 5,000 feet. The strata incline northward at angles of\r\n30° to 40°. All of the northern slope of the ridge is deeply covered\r\nwith snow, and the rock only appears along the immediate crest. There\r\nare, in fact, two crests, as is common with many mountain ridges in\r\nthis region, one of rock and the second of snow; the snow crest, which\r\nis usually the higher, is parallel to the rock crest and a few rods\r\nnorth of it. In the valley between the two ridges we found secure\r\nfooting, and ascended with ease to the highest point on the cliffs.\r\nLooking over the southern or rocky crest, we found a sheer descent of\r\nabout 1,500 feet to the snow-fields below.\r\n\r\nThe clouds diminished in density and gradually broke away, so that the\r\nentire extent of the St. Elias range was in view, with the exception\r\nof the crowning peak of all, which was still veiled from base to\r\nsummit. A spur of St. Elias, extending southward from the main peak,\r\nand named _The Chariot_, gleamed brightly in the sunlight. It was the\r\nfirst point on which we made observations. Stretching eastward from\r\nSt. Elias is the sharp crest of the main range, on which stand Mounts\r\nNewton, Jeannette, Malaspina, Augusta, Logan, and several other\r\nsplendid peaks not yet named. Just to the right of Mount Augusta, on\r\nthe immediate border of the Seward glacier, rise the Corwin cliffs,\r\nmarking an immense fault-scarp of the same general character as the\r\none on which we stood.\r\n\r\n{141} Mr. Kerr endeavored at first to occupy a station on the crest of\r\nthe rocky ridge, but as the steepness of the slope and the shattered\r\ncondition of the rock rendered the station hazardous, the snow-ridge,\r\nwhich was covered with dust and sand and nearly as firm as rock, was\r\noccupied instead. The clouds parting toward the northeast revealed\r\nseveral giant peaks not before seen, some of which seem to rival in\r\nheight St. Elias itself. One stranger, rising in three white domes far\r\nabove the clouds, was especially magnificent. As this was probably the\r\nfirst time its summit was ever seen, we took the liberty of giving it\r\na name. It will appear on our maps as _Mount Logan_, in honor of Sir\r\nWilliam E. Logan, founder and long director of the Geological Survey\r\nof Canada.\r\n\r\nThe clouds grew denser in the east, and shut off all hope of extending\r\nthe map-work in that direction. While Kerr was making topographic\r\nsketches I tried to decipher some of the geological history of the\r\nregion around me and make myself more familiar with its glaciers and\r\nsnow-fields.\r\n\r\nEven more remarkable than the mighty peaks toward the north, beheld\r\nthat day for the first time, was the vast plateau of ice stretching\r\nseaward from the foot of the mountains. From my station what seemed to\r\nbe the ocean's shore near Icy bay could just be distinguished. Beyond\r\nthe bay there is a group of hills which come boldly down to the sea,\r\nand apparently form a sea-cliff at the water's edge. Beyond this\r\nheadland there is another vast glacier extending westward to the\r\nlimits of vision. The view from this point is essentially the same as\r\nthat obtained from the cliffs at Pinnacle pass a few days earlier,\r\nexcept that it is far more extended. It need not be described in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe clouds becoming thicker and settling in dark masses about the\r\nmountains, we gave up all hope of further work and started for our\r\ncamp. On the way down the ridge between the crest of snow and the\r\ncrest of rock we found a stratum of sandstone filled with fossil\r\nleaves, and near at hand another layer charged with very recent\r\nsea-shells. Collecting all of these that we could carry, we trudged\r\non, finding the snow soft and some of the bridges which we had easily\r\ncrossed in the morning now weak, trembling, and insecure. We crossed\r\nthem safely, however, and, reaching the level floor of the\r\namphitheatre, marched wearily on toward Point Glorious. This time we\r\npassed along the northern base of the butte at an elevation of two or\r\nthree hundred feet {142} above the glacier, and, taking a convenient\r\nslide down the snow-slope, reached our tent.\r\n\r\nSoon a delicious cup of coffee was prepared, bacon was fried, and\r\nthese were put in a warm place while some griddle cakes were being\r\nbaked. A warm supper, followed by a restful pipe, ended the day. Kerr\r\nand I were our own cooks and our own housekeepers during much of the\r\ntime we lived above the snow-line. We cleared away the remains of the\r\nsupper, and prepared our blankets for the night. One of the huge ice\r\npinnacles on the glacier fell with a great crash just as we were\r\nturning in. Rain began to fall, and the night was cold and\r\ndisagreeable; how it passed I do not know, as I slept soundly.\r\nScarcely anything less serious than the blowing away of our tent could\r\nhave awakened me.\r\n\r\n\r\nACROSS SEWARD GLACIER TO DOME PASS.\r\n\r\nStormy weather and the necessity of bringing additional supplies from\r\nBlossom island detained us at Camp 14 until August 13. We rose at\r\nthree o'clock on the morning of that day, and, after a hasty\r\nbreakfast, prepared to cross the Seward glacier. The morning was cold\r\nbut clear, and the air was bracing. Each peak and mountain crest in\r\nthe rugged landscape stood out boldly in the early light, although the\r\nsun had not risen. Soon the summit of St. Elias became tipped with\r\ngold, and then peak after peak, in order of their rank, caught the\r\nradiance, and in a short time the vast snow-fields were of dazzling\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\nThe frost of the night before had hardened the snow, which made\r\nwalking a pleasure. We crossed a rocky spur projecting northward from\r\nPoint Glorious into the Seward glacier, and had to lower our packs\r\ndown the side of the precipice with the aid of ropes. Our course led\r\nat first up the border of the great glacier to a point above the head\r\nof the rapids already referred to, then curved to the westward, and\r\nfor a mile or two coincided with the general trend of the crevasses.\r\nWe made good progress, but at length we came to where the Augusta\r\nglacier pours its flood of ice into the main stream and, owing to its\r\nhigh grade, is greatly broken. Skirting this difficult area, we passed\r\na number of small blue lakelets and reached the western border of the\r\nSeward glacier. We found a gently rising snow-slope leading westward\r\nthrough a gap that could be seen in hills a few miles in advance. But\r\nlittle difficulty was now experienced, except that the snow {143} had\r\nbecome soft under the summer's sun, and walking over it with heavy\r\nloads was wearisome in the extreme. We could see, however, that the\r\nway ahead was clear, and that encouraged us to push on. Toward night\r\nwe found a camping place on a steep ridge of shale and sandstone\r\nprojecting eastward from a spur of Mount Malaspina. This ridge rises\r\nabout five hundred feet above the surrounding glacier, and has steep\r\nroof-like slopes. The summer sun had melted nearly all the snow from\r\nits southern face, but the northern slope was still heavily loaded.\r\nThe snow on the northern side stood some thirty or forty feet higher\r\nthan the rocky crest of the ridge itself, and between the rock crest\r\nand the snow crest there was a little valley which afforded ample\r\nshelter for our tent and was quite safe from avalanches. The melting\r\nof the snow-bank during the warm days supplied us with water.\r\n\r\nThe formation of crests of snow standing high above the rocky ridges\r\non which they rest is a peculiar and interesting feature of the\r\nmountains of the St. Elias region. A north-and-south section through\r\nthe ridge on which Camp 15 was situated, exhibiting the double crests,\r\none of rock and the other of snow, is shown at _a_ in figure 6. _b_ is\r\na section through a similar ridge with a still higher snow crest. The\r\nremaining figures in the illustration are sketches of mountain peaks,\r\nas seen from the south, which have been increased in height by a heavy\r\naccumulation of snow on their northern slopes. These sketches are of\r\npeaks among the foothills of Mount Malaspina, and show snow pinnacles\r\nfrom fifty to more than a hundred feet high. In some instances, domes\r\nand crests of snow were seen along the western sides of the ridges and\r\npeaks, but as a rule these snow-tips on the mountains are confined to\r\ntheir northern slopes. The edges and summits of the snow-ridges are\r\nsharply defined and clearly cut. The southern slope exposed above the\r\ncrest of rock is often concave, while the northern slopes are usually\r\nconvex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 6--_Snow Crests on Ridges and Peaks; from Field\r\nSketches_.]\r\n\r\nIn climbing steep ridges the double crests are frequently of great\r\nassistance. Safe footing may frequently be found in the channels\r\nbetween the crests of rock and snow, by the aid of which {144} very\r\nprecipitous peaks may be climbed with ease. In case the ascent between\r\nthe two crests is not practicable, the even snow-slope itself affords\r\na sure footing for one used to mountain climbing.\r\n\r\nAfter establishing Camp 15, Lindsley and Stamy returned to one of the\r\nlower camps for additional supplies, while Kerr and I explored a way\r\nfor farther advance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 18. HITCHCOCK RANGE, FROM NEAR DOME PASS.]\r\n\r\nOur camp occupied a commanding situation. From the end of the ridge on\r\nwhich it was located there was a splendid view of glaciers and\r\nmountains to the eastward. The illustration forming plate 18 is from a\r\nphotograph taken from that station. Toward the north, and only a few\r\nmiles away, rose the bare, rugged slope of Mount Malaspina. In a wild,\r\nhigh-grade gorge on its western side, a glacier, all pinnacles and\r\ncrevasses, tumbles down into the broad white plain below. On account\r\nof its splendid ice-fall this was named the _Cascade glacier_. Beyond\r\nthe white plain, stretching eastward for fifteen or twenty miles,\r\nthere rise the foothills of Mount Cook. Farther south, the rugged,\r\nangular summits of the Hitchcock range are in full view, and toward\r\nthe north stands _Mount Irving_,[32] which rivals even Mount Cook in\r\nthe symmetrical proportions of its snow-covered slopes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Named in honor of Professor Roland Duer Irving, U. S.\r\ngeologist.]\r\n\r\nThe surface of the vast snow-plain near at hand is gashed by many\r\ngaping fissures, but the distance is so great that these minor details\r\ndisappear in a general view. Looking down over the snow, one may see\r\nthe crevasses as in a diagram. They look as if the white surface had\r\nbeen gashed with a sharp knife, and then stretched in such a way as to\r\nopen the cuts. That the snow of the névés may be stretched, at least\r\nto a limited extent, is shown by the character of these fissures. The\r\ncrevasses are widest in the center and come to a point at their\r\ncurving extremities. Two crevasses frequently overlap at their ends\r\nand leave a sliver of ice stretching across diagonally between them.\r\nIt is by means of these diagonal bridges that one is enabled to thread\r\nhis way through the crevasses.\r\n\r\nOn returning to camp in the evening, weary with a hard day's climb, a\r\nnever-failing source of delight was found in the matchless winter\r\nlandscape to the eastward. The evenings following days of\r\nuninterrupted sunshine were especially delightful. The blue shadows of\r\nthe western peaks creeping across the shining surface were nearly as\r\nsharp in outline as the peaks that cast {145} them. When the chill of\r\nevening made itself felt, and the dropping water and the indefinite\r\nmurmurs from the glacier below were stilled, the silence became\r\noppressive. The stillness was so profound that it seemed as though the\r\nfootsteps of the advancing shadows should be audible.\r\n\r\nOn warm sunny days, however, there are noises enough amid the\r\nmountains. The snow, partially melted and softened by the heat, falls\r\nfrom the cliffs in avalanches that make the mountains tremble and,\r\nwith a roar like thunder, awaken the echoes far and near. During our\r\nstay at Camp 15 the avalanches were sometimes so frequent on the steep\r\nmountain faces toward the north that the roar of one falling mass of\r\nsnow and rocks was scarcely hushed before it was succeeded by another.\r\n\r\nOn the southward-facing cliffs of Mount Augusta, composed of schist\r\nwhich disintegrates rapidly, there are frequent rock avalanches. A\r\nrock or a mass of comminuted schist sometimes breaks away even in\r\nmidday, although these avalanches occur most frequently when the\r\nmoisture in the rocks freezes. The midday avalanches, I fancy, may be\r\nstarted by the expansion of the rocks owing to the sun's heat. A few\r\nstones dislodged high up on the cliffs fall, and, loosening others in\r\ntheir descent, soon set in motion a train of dirt and stones, which\r\nflows down the steep ravines with a long rumbling roar, at the same\r\ntime sending clouds of dust into the air. If the wind is blowing up\r\nthe cliffs, as frequently happens on warm days, the dust is carried\r\nfar above the mountains, and hangs in the air like clouds of smoke.\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently stated that St. Elias is a volcano, and sea\r\ncaptains sailing on the Pacific have seen what they supposed to be\r\nsmoke issuing from its summit. As its southern face is composed of the\r\nsame kind of rocks and is of the same precipitous nature as the\r\nsouthern slope of Mount Augusta, it appears probable that what was\r\nsupposed to be volcanic smoke was in reality avalanche dust blown\r\nupward by ascending air currents.\r\n\r\nThe disintegration of the mountain summits all through the St. Elias\r\nregion is so great that one constantly wonders that anything is left;\r\nyet, except late in the fall, the snow surfaces at the bases of even\r\nthe steepest cliffs are mostly bare of débris. The absence of earth\r\nand stones on the surfaces of the névé fields is mainly due, of\r\ncourse, to the fact that these are regions of accumulation where the\r\nwinter's snow exceeds the summer's melting. {146} Thus each year the\r\nsurface is renewed and made fresh and clean, and any débris that may\r\nhave previously accumulated is concealed.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason, however, why but little débris is found at\r\nthe bases of the steep precipices. The snows of winter are banked high\r\nagainst these walls, but when the rocks are warmed by the return of\r\nthe summer's sun the snow near their dark surfaces is melted, and\r\nleaves a deep gulf between the upward-sloping banks of snow and the\r\nsides of the cliffs. These black chasms are frequently 150 or 200 feet\r\ndeep, and receive all the débris that falls from above. In this way\r\nvery large quantities of earth and stones are injected, as it were,\r\ninto the glacier, and only come to light again far down toward the\r\nends of the ice-streams, where the summer's melting exceeds the\r\nwinter's supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 19. MT. ST. ELIAS, FROM DOME PASS.]\r\n\r\nOn August 14, Kerr and I made an excursion ahead to the border of the\r\nAgassiz glacier. The snow-slope south of our camp led westward up a\r\ngentle grade to a gap in the hills between two bold, snow-covered\r\ndomes. The gap through which the snow extended, uniting with a broad\r\nsnow-field sloping westward, was only a few hundred feet wide, and\r\nformed a typical mountain pass, designated on our map as _Dome pass_.\r\nIts elevation is 4,300 feet. When near the summit of the pass a few\r\nsteps carried us past the divide of snow, and revealed to our eager\r\neyes the wonderland beyond. St. Elias rose majestically before us,\r\nunobstructed by intervening hills, and bare of clouds from base to\r\nsummit. We were greatly encouraged by the prospect ahead, as there\r\nwere evidently no obstacles between us and the actual base of the\r\nmountain. A photograph of the magnificent peak was taken, from which\r\nthe illustration forming plate 19 has been drawn. To the right of the\r\nmain mountain mass, as shown in the illustration, rises _Mount\r\nNewton_,[33] one of the many separate mountain peaks crowning the\r\ncrest of the St. Elias range. Our way led down the snow-slope in the\r\nforeground to the border of the Agassiz glacier, which comes in view\r\nbetween the foot-hills in the middle distance and the sculptured base\r\non which the crowning pyramid of St. Elias stands. After reaching the\r\nAgassiz glacier we turned to the right, and made our way to the {147}\r\namphitheatre lying between Mount St. Elias and Mount Newton. On the\r\nday we discovered Dome pass, we pressed on down the western snow-slope\r\nand reached the side of the Agassiz glacier, which we found greatly\r\ncrevassed; selecting a camping place on a rocky spur, we returned to\r\nCamp 15, and two days later established camp at the place chosen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Named for Henry Newton, formerly of the School of Mines\r\nof Columbia college and author of a report on the geology of the Black\r\nhills of Dakota.]\r\n\r\nCamp 16 was similar in many ways to Camp 14. It had about the same\r\naltitude; it was at the western end of a rugged mountain spur, and on\r\nthe immediate border of a large southward-flowing glacier. On the\r\nlower portions of the cliffs, near at hand, there were velvety patches\r\nof brilliant Alpine flowers mingled with thick bunches of wiry grass\r\nand clumps of delicate ferns. Most conspicuous of all the showy\r\nplants, so bright and lovely in the vast wilderness of snow, were the\r\npurple lupines. Already the flowers on the lower portions of their\r\nspikes had matured, and pods covered with a thick coating of wooly\r\nhairs were beginning to be conspicuous. There are no bees and\r\nbutterflies in these isolated gardens, but brown flies with\r\nlong-pointed wings were abundant. A gray bird, a little larger than a\r\nsparrow, was seen flitting in and out of crevasses near the border of\r\nthe ice, apparently in quest of insects. Once, while stretched at full\r\nlength on the flowery carpet enjoying the warm sunlight, a humming\r\nbird flashed past me. Occasionally the hoarse cries of ravens were\r\nheard among the cliffs, but they seldom ventured near enough to be\r\nseen. These few suggestions were all there was to remind us of the\r\nsummer fields and shady forests in far-away lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nUP THE AGASSIZ GLACIER.\r\n\r\nFrom Camp 16 Kerr and I made an excursion across the Agassiz glacier,\r\nwhile Stamy and Lindsley returned to a lower camp for additional\r\nsupplies. We found the glacier greatly crevassed and the way across\r\nmore difficult than on any of the ice-fields we had previously\r\ntraversed; but by dint of perseverance, and after many changes in our\r\ncourse, we succeeded at last in reaching the western bank, and saw\r\nthat by climbing a precipice bordering an ice-cascade we could gain a\r\nplateau above, which we knew from previous observations to be\r\ncomparatively little broken. We returned to camp, and on August 18\r\nbegan the ascent of the glacier in earnest. We were favored in the\r\ntask by brilliant weather.\r\n\r\n{148} After reaching the western bank of the glacier, we made our way\r\nto the base of the precipice up which we had previously wished to\r\nclimb. In order to reach it, however, we had to throw our packs across\r\na crevasse over which there was no bridge, and followed them by\r\njumping. The side of the crevasse from which we sprang was higher than\r\nits opposite lip, and left us very uncertain as to how we were to\r\nreturn; but that was a matter for the future; our aim at the time was\r\nto ascend the glacier, and the return was of no immediate concern.\r\n\r\nReaching the base of the cliff at the side of the glacier, we ascended\r\nit without great difficulty, and came out upon the broad plateau of\r\nsnow above. Thinking that the way onward would be easier along the\r\nsteep snow-slope bordering the glacier, we made an effort to ascend in\r\nthat direction, and spent two or three precious hours in trying to\r\nfind a practicable route. Although the crevasses were fewer than on\r\nthe glacier proper, yet they were of larger size and had but few\r\nbridges. At last we came to a wide gulf on the opposite side of which\r\nthere was a perpendicular wall of snow a hundred feet high, and all\r\nfurther advance in that direction was stopped. Although obliged to\r\nturn back, our elevated position commanded a good view of the glacier\r\nbelow and enabled us to choose a way through the maze of crevasses\r\ncrossing it. Descending, we plodded wearily on in an irregular zigzag\r\ncourse; but the crevasses became broader and deeper as we advanced,\r\nand at length we found ourselves traversing flat table-like blocks of\r\nsnow, bounded on all sides by crevasses so deep that their bottoms\r\nwere lost to view. We made our way from one snow-table to another by\r\njumping the crevasses where they were narrowest, or by frail\r\nsnow-bridges spanning the profound gulfs. Night came on while we were\r\nyet in this wild, broken region, and no choice was left us but to\r\npitch our tent in the snow and wait until morning. The night was clear\r\nand cold, and a firm crust formed on the snow before morning. Although\r\nthe temperature was uncomfortable, we were cheered by the prospects of\r\na firm snow surface on the morrow.\r\n\r\nWe continued our march at sunrise and found the walking easy; but the\r\nsun soon came out with unusual brilliancy and softened the snow so\r\nmuch that even the slowest movements were fatiguing. We endeavored to\r\nforce our way up the center of the glacier through the crevasses and\r\npinnacles of a second ice-fall; but after several hours of exhausting\r\nexperience we were {149} obliged to change our plan, and endeavored to\r\nreach a mountain spur projecting from the western border of the\r\nglacier. The sunlight reflected from the snow was extremely brilliant,\r\nand the glare from every surface about us was painful to our eyes,\r\nalready weakened by many days' travel over the white snow. Each member\r\nof the party was provided with colored glasses, but in traversing\r\nsnow-bridges and jumping crevasses these had to be dispensed with. The\r\nresult was that all of us were suffering more or less from\r\nsnow-blindness.\r\n\r\nAbout noon we reached the base of the mountain spur toward which our\r\ncourse was bent. It projects into the western border of Agassiz\r\nglacier. It is the extension of this cliff underneath the glacier that\r\ncaused the ice-fall which blocked our way. To go round the end of the\r\ncliff with our packs was impracticable, but there seemed a way up the\r\nface of the cliff itself, which one could scale by taking advantage of\r\nthe joints in the rocks. I ascended the snow-slope to the base of the\r\nprecipice, but found the way upward more difficult than anticipated;\r\nand, as the light was very painful to my eyes when not protected by\r\ncolored glasses, I decided to postpone making the climb until I was in\r\nbetter condition, and in the meantime to see if some other route could\r\nnot be found. We decided to camp on a small patch of débris near the\r\nbase of the cliff, and there left our loads. Kerr and Lindsley, taking\r\na rope and alpenstocks, went around the end of the rocky spur and\r\nworked their way upward with great difficulty to the top of the cliff\r\nimmediately above where I had essayed to climb it. A rope was made\r\nfast at the top, and our way onward was secured. This place was\r\nafterward called _Rope cliff_. The remainder of the afternoon I rested\r\nin the tent, with my eyes bound up with tea-leaves, and when evening\r\ncame found the pain in my head much relieved.\r\n\r\nOur tent that night was so near the brink of a crevasse that in order\r\nto stay the tent one end of the ridge-rope was made fast to a large\r\nstone, which was lowered into the gulf to serve as a stake. Above us\r\nrose a precipice nearly a thousand feet high, from which stones were\r\nconstantly falling; but a deep black gulf intervened between the\r\nposition we had chosen and the base of the cliffs, and into this the\r\nstones were precipitated. Not one of the falling fragments reached the\r\nedge of the snow slope on which we were camped, but many times during\r\nthe night we heard the whiz and hum of the rocks as they shot down\r\nfrom the cliffs. {150} The noise made by each fragment in its passage\r\nthrough the air increased rapidly in pitch, thus indicating that they\r\nwere approaching us; but they always fell short of our camp. The\r\nbombardment from above was most active just after the shadows fell on\r\nthe cliffs, showing that the stones were loosened by the freezing of\r\nthe water in the interstices of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe next day, August 20, Stamy and Lindsley went back to Camp 16 for\r\nmore rations, while Kerr and I remained at Camp 18 nursing our eyes\r\nand resting. The day passed without anything worthy of note, except\r\nthe almost constant thunder of avalanches on the mountains. About\r\nsunset a dense fog spread over the wintry landscape and threatened to\r\ndelay the return of the men. When the sun went down, however, the\r\ntemperature fell several degrees, the mist vanished, and a few stars\r\ncame out clear and bright. Just as we were about to despair of seeing\r\nthe men that night we heard a distant shout announcing their return.\r\nWe had a cup of hot coffee for them when they reached the tent, which\r\nthey drank with eagerness; but they were too tired to partake of food.\r\nRolling themselves in their blankets, they were asleep in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMP ON THE NEWTON GLACIER.\r\n\r\nOn August 21 we climbed the cliff above Camp 18 by means of the rope\r\nalready placed there, and found the snow above greatly crevassed. We\r\ntraveled upward along the steep slope bordering the glacier, but soon\r\ncame to a deep crevasse which forbade further progress in that\r\ndirection. Returning to a lower level, we undertook to smooth off an\r\nextremely narrow snow-bridge so as to make it wide enough to cross,\r\nbut found the undertaking so hazardous that we abandoned it. By this\r\ntime it was midday, and we prepared a cup of hot coffee before\r\nrenewing our attack on the cliffs. After luncheon and a short rest,\r\nfeeling very much refreshed, we began to cut a series of steps in a\r\nbluff of snow about fifty feet high, and made rapid progress in the\r\nundertaking. After an hour's hard work one of us reached the top and,\r\nplanting an alpenstock deep in the snow, lowered a rope to those\r\nbelow. The packs were drawn up one at a time and we were soon ready to\r\nadvance again.\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves in a vast amphitheatre bounded on all sides\r\nexcepting that from which we had come with rugged, {151} snow-covered\r\nprecipices. The plain was crossed by huge crevasses, some of which\r\nwere fully a mile in length; but by traveling around their ends or\r\ncrossing snow-bridges we slowly worked our way onward toward St.\r\nElias. Threading our way through the labyrinth of yawning gulfs, we at\r\nlast, after the sun had gone down behind the great pyramid toward the\r\nwest, found a convenient place on the snow, near a blue pond of water,\r\non which to pass the night. Everything was snow-covered in the vast\r\nlandscape except the most precipitous cliffs, and these were dangerous\r\nto approach, owing to the avalanches that frequently fell from them.\r\nThe weather continued fine. The night was clear and the stars were\r\nunusually brilliant. Everything seemed favorable for pushing on. The\r\nway ahead presented such even snow-slopes and seemed so free from\r\ncrevasses that we decided to leave our tent and blankets in the\r\nmorning and, taking with us as little as possible of impedimenta,\r\nendeavor to reach the summit of St. Elias.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGHEST POINT REACHED.\r\n\r\nRising at three o'clock on the morning of August 22, we started for\r\nthe summit of St. Elias, taking with us only our water-proof coats,\r\nsome food, and the necessary instruments. The higher mountain summits\r\nwere no longer clearly defined, but in the early light it was\r\nimpossible to tell whether or not the day was to be fair. From the\r\nhighest and sharpest peaks, cloud banners were streaming off towards\r\nthe southeast, showing that the higher air currents were in rapid\r\nmovement. Vapor banks in the east were flushed with long streamers of\r\nlight as the sun rose, but soon faded to a dull ashen gray, while the\r\ncloud banners between us and the sun became brilliant like the halo\r\nseen around the moon when the sky is covered with fleecy clouds. This\r\nwas the first time in my experience that I had seen colored banners\r\nwaving from the mountain tops.\r\n\r\nWe found the snow-surface hard, and made rapid headway up the glacier.\r\nOur only difficulty was the uncertainty of the early light, which\r\nrendered it impossible to tell the slope of the uneven snow-surfaces.\r\nThe light was so evenly diffused that there were no shadows. The rare\r\nbeauty of that silent, wintry landscape, so delicate in its pearly\r\nhalf tones and so softly lighted, was unreal and fairy-like. The winds\r\nwere still; but {152} strange forebodings of coming changes filled the\r\nair. Long, waving threads of vapor were woven in lace-work across the\r\nsky; the white-robed mountains were partially concealed by\r\ncloud-masses drifting like spirits along their mighty battlements; and\r\nfar, far above, from the topmost pinnacles, irised banners were\r\nsignaling the coming of a storm.\r\n\r\nWe made rapid progress, but early in the day came to the base of a\r\nheavy cloud bank which enshrouded all the upper part of St. Elias.\r\nThen snow began to fall, and it was evident that to proceed farther\r\nwould be rash and without promise of success. After twenty days of\r\nfatigue and hardship since leaving Blossom island, with our goal\r\nalmost reached, we were obliged to turn back. Hoping to be able to\r\nrenew the attempt after the storm had passed, Mr. Kerr left his\r\ninstruments on the snow between two huge crevasses and we returned to\r\nour tent, where we passed the remainder of the day and the night\r\nfollowing. The snow continued to fall throughout the day, and the\r\nstorm increased in force as night came on. When we awoke in the\r\nmorning the tempest was still raging. We were in the midst of the\r\nstorm-cloud; the dense vapor and the fine drifting snow-crystals swept\r\nalong by the wind obscured everything from view; the white snow\r\nsurface could not be distinguished from the vapor-filled air; there\r\nwas no earth and no sky; we seemed to be suspended in a white,\r\ntranslucent medium which surrounded us like a shroud. The snow was\r\nalready more than three feet deep about our tent, and to remain longer\r\nwith the short supply of provisions on hand was exceedingly hazardous,\r\nas there seemed no limit to the duration of the storm. A can of\r\nrations had been left at Rope cliff, and we decided to return to that\r\nplace if possible. Resuming our packs, we roped ourselves together and\r\nbegan to descend through the blinding mist and snow which rendered the\r\natmosphere so dense that a man could not be distinguished at a\r\ndistance of a hundred feet. With only an occasional glimpse of the\r\nwhite cliff around to guide us, we worked our way downward over\r\nsnow-bridges and between the crevasses. Our ascent through this\r\ndangerous region had been slow and difficult, but our descent was\r\nstill more tedious. All day long we continued to creep slowly along\r\nthrough the blinding storm, and as night approached believed ourselves\r\nnear the steps cut in a snow-cliff during the ascent, but darkness\r\ncame before we reached them. Shoveling the snow away as best we could\r\nwith our hands and {153} basins, we cleared a place down to the old\r\nsnow large enough for our tent and went into camp.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, August 24, the storm had spent its force and left the\r\nmountains with an immaculate covering, but still partially veiled by\r\nshreds of storm-clouds. We found ourselves on one of the many tables\r\nof snow, bounded on all sides by crevasses of great depth, but not far\r\nfrom the snow-cliff where we had cut steps. The steps were obliterated\r\nby the new snow, but by means of a rope and alpenstocks we made the\r\ndescent without much difficulty. The last man to go down, not having\r\nthe help of the rope, used two alpenstocks, and descended by first\r\nplanting one firmly in the snow and lowering himself as far as he\r\ncould, still retaining a firm hold, and then planting the other in the\r\nsnow at a lower level and removing the higher one. By slowly and\r\ncarefully repeating this operation he descended the cliff safely and\r\nrejoined his companions. Passing on beneath the cliffs, dangerous on\r\naccount of avalanches, we reached in safety the precipice where we had\r\nleft our rope. A heavy avalanche had swept down from the heights above\r\nduring our absence and sent its spray over the precipice we had to\r\ndescend. The cliff of ice towering above the place where our rope was\r\nfastened had become greatly melted and honey-combed, and threatened\r\nevery moment to crash down and destroy any one who chanced to be\r\nbeneath. To stand above the precipice in the shadow of the treacherous\r\nsnow-cliffs while the men were descending the rope was exceedingly\r\ntrying to one's nerves; but the avalanches did not come, and the\r\nprevious camping place below Rope cliff was reached with safety.\r\n\r\nThe following day, August 25, after some consultation, it was decided\r\nto once more attempt to reach the top of Mount St. Elias. Lindsley and\r\nStamy, who had shared without complaint our privations in the snow,\r\nvolunteered to descend to a lower camp for additional rations, while\r\nKerr and myself returned to the higher camp in the hope that we might\r\nbe able to ascend the peak before the men returned, and, if not, to\r\nhave sufficient rations when they did rejoin us to continue the\r\nattack. The men departed on their difficult errand, while Kerr and I,\r\nwith blankets, tents, oil-stoves, and what rations remained, once more\r\nscaled the cliff where we had placed a rope, and returned on the trail\r\nmade the day previously. About noon we reached the excavation in the\r\nsnow where we had bivouacked in the storm, {154} and there prepared a\r\nlunch. It was then discovered that we had been mistaken as to the\r\nquantity of oil in our cans; we found scarcely enough to cook a single\r\nmeal. To attempt to remain several days in the snow with this small\r\nsupply of fuel seemed hazardous, and Mr. Kerr volunteered to descend\r\nand overtake the men at the lower camp, procure some oil, and return\r\nthe following day. We then separated, Mr. Kerr starting down the\r\nmountain, leaving me with a double load, weighing between sixty and\r\nseventy pounds, to carry through the deep snow to the high camp\r\npreviously occupied.\r\n\r\n\r\nALONE IN THE HIGHEST CAMP.\r\n\r\nTrudging wearily on, I reached the high camp at sunset, and pitched my\r\ntent in the excavation previously occupied. An alpenstock was used for\r\none tent-pole, and snow saturated with water, piled up in a column,\r\nfor the other; the snow froze in a few minutes, and held the tent\r\nsecurely. The ends of the ridge-rope were then stamped into the snow,\r\nand water was poured over them; the edges of the tent were treated in\r\na similar manner, and my shelter was ready for occupation. After\r\ncooking some supper over the oil-stove, I rolled myself in a blanket\r\nand slept the sleep of the weary. I was awakened in the morning by\r\nsnow drifting into my tent, and on looking out discovered that I was\r\nagain caught in a blinding storm or mist of snow. The storm raged all\r\nday and all night, and continued without interruption until the\r\nevening of the second day. The coal oil becoming exhausted, a can was\r\nfilled with bacon grease, in which a cotton rag was placed for a wick;\r\nand over this \"witch lamp\" I did my cooking during the remainder of my\r\nstay. The snow, falling steadily, soon buried my tent, already\r\nsurrounded on three sides by an icy wall higher than my head, and it\r\nwas only by almost constant exertion that it was kept from being\r\ncrushed in. With a pint basin for a shovel I cleared the tent as best\r\nI could, and several times during the day re-excavated the hole\r\nleading down to the pond, which had long since disappeared beneath the\r\nlevel plain of white. The excavation of a tunnel in the snow was also\r\nbegun in the expectation that the tent would become uninhabitable. The\r\nfollowing night it became impossible to keep the tent clear in spite\r\nof energetic efforts, and early in the morning it was crushed in by a\r\ngreat weight of snow, {155} leaving me no alternative but to finish my\r\nsnow-house and move in. A tunnel some four or five feet in length was\r\nexcavated in the snow, and a chamber about six feet long by four feet\r\nwide and three feet high was made at right angles to the tunnel. In\r\nthis chamber I placed my blankets and other belongings, and, hanging a\r\nrubber coat on an alpenstock at the entrance, found myself well\r\nsheltered from the tempest. There I passed the day and the night\r\nfollowing. At night the darkness and silence in my narrow tomb-like\r\ncell was oppressive; not a sound broke the stillness except the\r\ndistant, muffled roar of an occasional avalanche. I slept soundly,\r\nhowever, and in the morning was awakened by the croaking of a raven on\r\nthe snow immediately above my head. The grotto was filled with a soft\r\nblue light, but a pink radiance at the entrance told that the day had\r\ndawned bright and clear.\r\n\r\nWhat a glorious sight awaited me! The heavens were without a cloud,\r\nand the sun shone with dazzling splendor on the white peaks around.\r\nThe broad unbroken snow-plain seemed to burn with light reflected from\r\nmillions of shining crystals. The great mountain peaks were draped\r\nfrom base to summit in the purest white, as yet unscarred by\r\navalanches. On the steep cliffs the snow hung in folds like drapery,\r\ntier above tier, while the angular peaks above stood out like crystals\r\nagainst the sky. St. Elias was one vast pyramid of alabaster. The\r\nwinds were still; not a sound broke the solitude; not an object moved.\r\nEven the raven had gone, leaving me alone with the mountains.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose higher and higher and made its warmth felt, the snow\r\nwas loosened on the steep slopes and here and there broke away.\r\nGathering force as it fell, it rushed down in avalanches that made the\r\nmountains tremble and awakened thunderous echoes. From a small\r\nbeginning high up on the steep slopes, the new snow would slip\r\ndownward, silently at first, and cascade over precipices hundreds of\r\nfeet high, looking like a fall of foaming water; then came the roar,\r\nincreasing in volume as the flowing snow involved new fields in its\r\npath of destruction, until the great mass became irresistible and\r\nploughed its way downward through clouds of snow-spray, which hung in\r\nthe air long after the snow had ceased to move and the roar of the\r\navalanche had ceased. All day long, until the shadow of evening fell\r\non the steep slopes, this mountain thunder continued. The echoes of\r\none avalanche scarcely died away before they were {156} awakened by\r\nanother roar. To witness such a scene under the most favorable\r\nconditions was worth all the privations and anxiety it cost.\r\n\r\nBesides the streams of new snow, there were occasional avalanches of a\r\ndifferent character, caused by the breaking away of portions of the\r\ncliffs of old snow, accumulated, perhaps, during several winters.\r\nThese start from the summits of precipices, and are caused by the slow\r\ndownward creep of the snow-fields above. The snow-cliffs are always\r\ncrevassed and broken in much the same manner as are the ends of\r\nglaciers which enter the sea, and occasionally large masses,\r\ncontaining thousands of cubic yards, break away and are precipitated\r\ndown the slopes with a suddenness that is always startling. Usually\r\nthe first announcement of these avalanches is a report like that of a\r\ncannon, followed by a rumbling roar as the descending mass ploughs its\r\nway along. The avalanches formed by old snow are quite different from\r\nthose caused by the descent of the new surface snow, but are\r\nfrequently accompanied by surface streams in case there has been a\r\nrecent storm. The paths ploughed out by the avalanches are frequently\r\nsheathed with glassy ice, formed by the freezing of water produced by\r\nthe melting of snow on account of the heat produced by the friction of\r\nthe moving mass. A third variety of avalanches, due to falling stones,\r\nhas already been noticed.\r\n\r\nThe floor of my snow-chamber was the surface of the old snow on which\r\nwe had pitched our tents at the time we first reached that camping\r\nplace. On this hard surface, and forming the walls of the cell, there\r\nwere thirty inches of clear white snow, the upper limit of which was\r\nmarked by a blue layer of ice about a quarter of an inch thick. This\r\nindicated the thickness of snow that fell during the first storm. Its\r\nsurface had been melted and softened during the days of sunshine that\r\nfollowed its fall, and had frozen into clear ice. Above the blue band\r\nwhich encircled the upper portion of my chamber was the soft, pure\r\nwhite snow of the second storm. The stratification of snow which I had\r\nseen fall rendered it evident that my interpretation of the\r\nstratification observed in the sides of crevasses was correct. The\r\nsnow when it fell was soft and white, and composed of very fine\r\ncrystals; but under the influence of the air and sunshine it changed\r\nits texture and became icy and granular, and then resembled the névé\r\nsnow so common in high mountains.\r\n\r\n{157} The day following the storm was bright and beautiful; the\r\nsunlight was warm and pleasant, but the temperature in the shadows was\r\nalways below freezing. The surface of the snow did not melt\r\nsufficiently during the day to freeze and form a crust during the\r\nnight. It thus became more and more apparent that the season was too\r\nfar advanced to allow the snow to harden sufficiently for us to be\r\nable to climb the mountain. The snow settled somewhat and changed its\r\ncharacter, but even at midday the crystals on the surface glittered as\r\nbrilliantly in the sunlight as they did in the early morning. Although\r\nthe snow did not melt, its surface was lowered slightly by\r\nevaporation. The tracks of the raven, at first sunken a quarter of an\r\ninch in the soft surface, after the first day of sunshine stood\r\nslightly in relief, but were still clearly defined.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day after separating from my companions, judging that\r\nthey must have returned at least to the camping place where we had\r\nseparated, I packed my blankets and what food remained, abandoned the\r\ntent and oil-stove, and started to descend the mountain. The snow had\r\nsettled somewhat, but was still soft and yielding and over six feet\r\ndeep. Tramping wearily on through the chaff-like substance, I slowly\r\nworked my way downward, and again threaded the maze of crevasses, now\r\npartially concealed by the layer of new snow, with which we had\r\nstruggled several times before. Midway to the next camping place I met\r\nmy companions coming up to search for me. Instead of meeting three\r\nmen, as I expected, I saw five tramping along in single file through\r\nthe deep snow. The sight of human beings in that vast solitude was so\r\nstrange that I watched them for some time before shouting. Glad as I\r\nwas to meet my companions once more, I could not help noticing their\r\nrough and picturesque appearance. Each man wore colored glasses and\r\ncarried a long alpenstock, and two or three had packs strapped on\r\ntheir backs. Several weeks of hard tramping over moraines and\r\nsnow-fields had made many rents in their clothes, which had been\r\nmended with cloth of any color that chanced to be available. Not a few\r\nrags were visible fluttering in the wind. To a stranger they would\r\nhave appeared like a dangerous band of brigands.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the presence of five men instead of three was this:\r\nLindsley and Stamy, when they left us at Rope cliff to {158} return\r\nfor additional rations, were obliged to go back to Camp 12 in order to\r\nget a tent and an oil-stove. On reaching that place the temptation to\r\nreturn to Blossom island was so great that Lindsley could not resist\r\nit and went back to the base-camp, where he reported that Kerr and I\r\nwere storm-bound in the mountains and in need of assistance. Three\r\nmen, Partridge, Doney, and White, started at once, and found Stamy,\r\nwho had waited for their arrival at Camp 12. A day was thus lost,\r\nwhich increased Mr. Kerr's hardship and might have proved disastrous.\r\nThe party then returned to Rope cliff and joined Kerr on the evening\r\nof August 29. On this occasion, as on several others, I found myself\r\nindebted to Stamy for willing assistance when others hesitated.\r\n\r\nDuring my imprisonment at the highest camp, Mr. Kerr was detained\r\nunder similar circumstances at the camp below Rope cliff. On\r\nendeavoring to rejoin me with the supply of coal oil, so very valuable\r\nunder the circumstances, he was caught in the storm and was unable to\r\nreach the rendezvous appointed. He reached Rope cliff late in the\r\nafternoon of the first day of the storm, climbed the precipice, and\r\nfound his way through the gathering darkness, along the nearly\r\nobliterated trail beneath the avalanche cliffs, and up the steps cut\r\nin the snow-cliff, to the site of our bivouac camp. Finding nothing\r\nthere, and being unable to proceed farther through the blinding storm,\r\nhe abandoned the attempt and returned to the camp below Rope cliff. In\r\ndescending the rope, he found that its lower end had become fast in\r\nthe snow. The taut line, sheathed with ice, was an uncertain help in\r\nthe darkness. Midway in the descent his hands slipped and he slid to\r\nthe bottom; but the cushion of new snow broke the fall and prevented\r\nserious injury. Alone, without fire, without blankets, having only a\r\ncanvas cover and a rubber cloth for shelter, and with but little food,\r\nhe passed three anxious days and nights before the arrival of the camp\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN.\r\n\r\nDeciding that the ascent of Mount St. Elias could not be accomplished\r\nthrough the new snow, which refused to harden, it was decided to\r\nabandon the attempt and return to Blossom island. Our retreat was none\r\ntoo soon. Storm succeeded storm throughout September. Each time the\r\nclouds lifted, the mantle {159} of new snow was seen to have descended\r\nlower and lower. Our last view showed the wintry covering nearly down\r\nto timber-line.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 31 we slept at the camp beneath Rope cliff, but\r\nhad a most uncomfortable night. Six men sleeping in a tent measuring\r\nseven by seven feet, with but little protection from the ice beneath,\r\ncertainly does not seem inviting to one surrounded by the comforts of\r\ncivilization. A large part of the night was occupied by Doney in\r\npreparing breakfast over our oil-stove. An early start was welcome to\r\nall; we were disappointed at not being able to reach the top of St.\r\nElias, and were anxious to return to more comfortable quarters. Kerr\r\nconcluded to return at once to Blossom island to recuperate, while I\r\nmade an excursion up the Seward glacier, with the hope of gaining the\r\nupper ice-fall and seeing the amphitheatre beyond.\r\n\r\nWe left Rope cliff about six in the morning, and found the snow hard\r\nand traveling easy for several hours. After descending the lower\r\nice-fall, however, the snow became soft, and a change in the\r\natmosphere indicated the approach of another storm. Kerr and Doney\r\npressed on and were soon lost to sight, while the rest of the party\r\nwere delayed, owing to Partridge having become snow-blind and almost\r\nhelpless. As the crevasses were exceedingly numerous and the\r\nsnow-bridges soft and uncertain, the task of conducting a blind man to\r\na place of safety was by no means light. Partridge bore up bravely\r\nunder his affliction, however, and did not hesitate in crawling across\r\nthe treacherous snow-bridges with a rope fastened about his body and a\r\nman before and behind to assist his movements. Late in the day we\r\nreached our camping place at the eastern border of the Agassiz\r\nglacier, while Kerr and Doney crossed Dome pass and spent the night in\r\na tent that had been left standing at the first camping east of the\r\npass. We pitched a tent on our old camping place at Camp 16, and had\r\nthe luxury of a rocky bed to sleep on that night. As Partridge's\r\nblindness still continued, White was sent ahead to tell Kerr and Doney\r\nto wait for us in the morning, so that Partridge could accompany them\r\nto Blossom island. Rain continued all that night and all the next day.\r\nAs Partridge's eyes were still unserviceable in the morning, I\r\nconcluded to wait a day before allowing him to start for Blossom\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nToward evening on September 2 we moved our camp across {160} Dome\r\npass, and pitched our tent on the high ridge beside the one occupied\r\nby Kerr and Doney. In the morning, although the storm still continued,\r\nour party divided, Kerr, Doney, and Partridge starting early for\r\nBlossom island, while Stamy, White, and myself, after following their\r\ntracks for a few miles, turned to the left and worked our way\r\nnortheastward among the crevasses of the Seward glacier. Toward\r\nevening we reached the northwestern spur of Mount Owen, but found the\r\ncliffs rising abruptly from the glacier and too favorable for\r\navalanches to admit of our camping near them. Again we were forced to\r\ngo into camp on the open glacier, and were less comfortable than\r\npreviously on similar occasions, owing to the fact that we had been\r\nexposed to the rains for three successive days and our blankets and\r\nclothes were wet. Rain continued all night and all the next day, and\r\non the following night changed to snow.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of September 4 we awoke to find the skies clear, but\r\nthe mountains all about us were white with snow. Before the sun rose,\r\nWhite and I started for the top of the high ridge above us, determined\r\nto have at least a distant view of the amphitheatre which we wished to\r\nexplore. The snow about our camp was only six or eight inches deep,\r\nbut as we ascended the mountain it grew more and more troublesome, and\r\nat a height of a thousand feet above camp was thirty inches deep. On\r\ngaining the summit of the ridge a magnificent view was obtained of the\r\nupper portion of the Seward glacier and of Mount Irving and Mount\r\nLogan, and many bold, tapering mountains farther northeastward. The\r\nwhole landscape was snow-covered, and as the sun rose clear in the\r\neast became of the most dazzling brilliancy. An icy wind swept down\r\nfrom the northeast and rendered it exceedingly difficult to take\r\nphotographs or to make measurements. On endeavoring to use my\r\nprismatic compass, I found that, having been soaked with moisture\r\nduring the previous days of storm, it froze solid and refused to move,\r\non being exposed to the air. Making what observations I could, we\r\nstarted back to camp with the intention of abandoning all further\r\nattempts to work in the high mountains.\r\n\r\nOn the steep slope now exposed to the full sunshine several avalanches\r\nhad gone down, and there was great danger of others. Selecting a point\r\nwhere an avalanche had already swept away the new snow, we worked our\r\nway downward in a zigzag course and reached the bottom safely,\r\nalthough an avalanche starting {161} near at hand swept by within a\r\nfew yards. When nearly at the bottom my attention was attracted by a\r\nnoise above, and on looking up I saw two rocks bounding down the slope\r\nand coming straight for me. To dodge them on the steep slippery slope\r\nwas difficult and dangerous. Allowing one to pass over my right\r\nshoulder, I instantly moved in that direction and allowed the other to\r\npass over my left shoulder. They shot by me like fragments of shells,\r\nbut did no injury. Reaching camp, we found that Stamy had dried our\r\nblankets and clothes.\r\n\r\nResuming our packs, we slowly threaded our way downward to Camp 14, at\r\nthe western end of the Pinnacle pass cliffs. We there found cans of\r\nrations left several days before and, pitching our tent, passed the\r\nnight. We knew by the signs found there that Kerr and his companions,\r\nafter taking lunch, had renewed their journey toward Blossom island.\r\nOur camp was just at the lower limit of the new snow. To the northward\r\nall was of the purest white, but southward, down the glacier, the\r\nsnow-fields were yellow and much discolored. Many changes had taken\r\nplace in the Seward glacier since we first saw it; the pinnacles,\r\nsnow-tables, and crevasses in the rapids were less striking than\r\nformerly, and had evidently suffered greatly from the summer's heat.\r\nAbout the bases of the cliffs there were dark, irregular patches of\r\ndébris, where a month previously all was white. As nearly as could be\r\njudged, the surface of the glacier had been lowered by melting and\r\nsettling during our absence about fifty feet.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, September 5, we started for Blossom island, the\r\nweather still continuing thick and stormy. On crossing Pinnacle pass\r\nwe found over a foot of new snow which had fallen since our companions\r\npassed that way. Toward nightfall the lower limit of snow on the\r\nMarvine glacier was reached, and at night we camped on the first\r\nmoraines which appeared below the névé. The day following, September\r\n6, we reached Blossom island about noon, and found that Kerr and his\r\nparty had arrived there safely, and that Partridge had recovered from\r\nhis snow-blindness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur stay above the snow-line had lasted thirty-five days, and we were\r\nextremely glad to see the light of a camp-fire and have the trees and\r\nflowers about us once more. The vegetation indicated that the season\r\nwas already far advanced. Most of the flowers had faded, and autumn\r\ntints gave brilliancy to the {162} lower mountain slopes; salmon\r\nberries and huckleberries were in profusion, and furnished an\r\nexceedingly agreeable change in our diet. After a bath in one of the\r\nsmall lakelets on the island and a good night's rest on a luxuriant\r\nbed of spruce boughs, we felt fully restored and ready for another\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nAs Kerr was anxious to get back to Port Mulgrave, it was arranged that\r\nLindsley and Partridge should go with him, and that the rest of the\r\nmen should remain. Kerr took his departure on the morning of September\r\n7, and on the following day Christie, Doney, and myself crossed the\r\nMarvine glacier to the southern end of the Hitchcock range, and the\r\nfollowing day made an excursion out upon the Malaspina glacier. The\r\nday of our excursion was bright and beautiful, and the mountains to\r\nthe northward revealed their full magnificence. The level plateau of\r\nice formed a horizontal plain, from which the mountain rose\r\nprecipitously and appeared grander and more majestic than from any\r\nother point of view. St. Elias rose clear and sharp, without a cloud\r\nto obscure its dizzy height, and appeared to be one sheer precipice.\r\nIt is doubtful if a more impressive mountain face exists anywhere else\r\nin the world. After learning all we could concerning the Malaspina\r\nglacier we returned to our camp at the end of the Hitchcock range, and\r\nthe following day tramped across the extremely rough moraine-covered\r\nsurface back to Blossom island.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, September 12, we started on our return trip to\r\nYakutat bay. Two small tents and many articles for which we had no\r\nfurther use were abandoned, so as to make our packs light as possible.\r\nWe crossed the Hayden glacier, and at night camped at the foot of\r\nFloral pass. After making two intermediate camps, traveling each day\r\nin the rain, we reached the shore of Yakutat bay on September 15.\r\n\r\nDoney and I halted at Dalton's cabin for the purpose of seeing what we\r\ncould of the openings there made for coal, while the rest of the party\r\npressed on to our old camping place on the shore. There they found\r\nKerr and his party still encamped, but ready to leave for Port\r\nMulgrave early the next morning.\r\n\r\nSeptember 18 was occupied by us in catching salmon and trout. We were\r\nabundantly successful, as every man returned to camp with all that he\r\ncould carry. These were spread out on a rack over our camp-fire and\r\nsmoked for further use, as we did not know how long our stay would be\r\nextended. On the next day Stamy and Lindsley returned from Port\r\nMulgrave, where they {163} had left Kerr, quite recovered from his\r\nexposure on the mountain. Stormy weather continued, and a gale from\r\nthe northeast piled the ice high on the beach and threatened to sweep\r\naway our tents, as has already been briefly described in earlier\r\npages.\r\n\r\nOn September 20, our tents having been beaten in by a violent storm\r\nand our camping place overflowed by the waters from a lake above us,\r\nwe removed our goods to a place of safety and went to Dalton's cabin,\r\nwhere we awaited better weather. The morning of September 23 dawned\r\nclear and bright, and after drying our clothes around a blazing\r\ncamp-fire, we started back to our camping place on the shore. Before\r\nreaching there, however, we were rejoiced to see the _Corwin_ coming\r\nup the bay. It took us but a short time to get on board, where Captain\r\nC. L. Hooper, her commander, did everything in his power to make us\r\nwelcome and comfortable. To him we are indebted for a delightful\r\nvoyage back to civilization.\r\n\r\nAfter steaming up Disenchantment bay nearly to the ice-cliffs of the\r\nHubbard glacier, and obtaining a fine view of the glaciers about\r\nDisenchantment bay, the _Corwin_ returned to Port Mulgrave and, on\r\nSeptember 25, put to sea. After a splendid ocean passage, we arrived\r\nat Port Townsend on October 2.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring our stay in Alaska not a man was seriously sick and not an\r\naccident happened. The work planned at the start was carried out\r\nalmost to the letter, with the exception that snow-storms and the\r\nlateness of the season did not permit us to reach the summit of Mount\r\nSt. Elias.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nShould another attempt be made to climb Mount St. Elias, the shortest\r\nand most practicable route from the coast would be to land at Icy bay\r\nand ascend the Agassiz glacier. The course taken by us in 1890 could\r\nbe intersected just north of where the tributary glacier from Dome\r\npass joins the main ice-stream; and from there the route followed last\r\nsummer would be the most practicable. A camp should be established on\r\nthe divide between Mount St. Elias and Mount Newton, from which\r\nexcursions to either of these peaks could be made in a single day.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding narrative many details have been omitted. One of\r\nthese is that tents, together with blankets, rations, etc., were left\r\nat two convenient points between Blossom island and {164} the Agassiz\r\nglacier, and were used by the men in bringing up supplies. In\r\nattempting to ascend Mount St. Elias from Icy bay by the route\r\nsuggested, at least three such relay stations should be established\r\nbetween the Chaix hills, where wood for camp-fires can be obtained (as\r\nis known from the reports of the New York _Times_ and Topham\r\nexpeditions), and the high camp on the divide. The relay camps\r\nsuggested should be one day's march apart, and would serve not only\r\nfor stopping places while carrying rations during the advance, but\r\nwould furnish a line of retreat. A party making this journey should be\r\nprovided with snow-shoes, which unfortunately we did not take with us.\r\n\r\nAll rations intended for use above the snow-line should be packed in\r\ntin cans, each of sufficient size to hold between fifty and sixty\r\npounds, and each should be securely soldered. All articles packed in\r\nthis way should be thoroughly dry and should be packed in a dry, warm\r\nroom. When secured in this manner they are about as easy to carry as\r\nif packed in bags, and can be \"cached\" anywhere out of the reach of\r\nfloods and avalanches, with the certainty of being serviceable when\r\nwanted. The more perishable articles to be used where camp-fires are\r\npossible should also be secured in tin cans. Sacks of flour,\r\ncorn-meal, etc., should be protected by an outer covering of strong\r\ncanvas. The experience of last summer showed that the cans of rations\r\nintended for use above the snow-line should each contain about the\r\nfollowing ration, which may be varied to suit individual taste:\r\n\r\n  Bacon, smoked . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  10 lbs.\r\n  Corned beef, in can . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   6  \"\r\n  Flour and corn-meal, with necessary quantity of baking\r\n    powder  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  15  \"\r\n  Coffee  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   2  \"\r\n  Rolled oats . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   5  \"\r\n  Sugar . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   5  \"\r\n  Chocolate, sweet  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   2  \"\r\n  Salt  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   ¼  \"\r\n  Extract of beef . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   ¼  \"\r\n  Tobacco . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   ½  \"\r\n  Condensed milk (small cans) . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   2\r\n  Matches (wax) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   1 box.\r\n\r\nOur experience with oil-stoves showed that they are serviceable. While\r\non the march they can be carried as hand packs in {165} gunny-sacks.\r\nRectangular cans holding about a gallon each, with small screw-tops,\r\nwere found convenient for carrying coal oil. The experience of Arctic\r\nexplorers indicates that alcohol would perhaps be better than coal oil\r\nto use in snow-camps.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important articles to be provided are strong shoes or\r\nboots; of these each man should have at least two pairs. Strong\r\nhip-boots, with lacings over the instep, are exceedingly serviceable.\r\nWhen sleeping on the ice the boot-legs may be spread beneath one's\r\nblankets and the feet used as a pillow. The long legs are serviceable\r\nalike in the thick brush on the shore and in the deep snow on the high\r\nmountains. With their protection, many streams can be waded without\r\ngetting wet. Leather, waxed ends, awls, etc., for repairing boots, and\r\ntallow mixed with bees-wax for greasing them, should be taken and\r\ndistributed in part through the cans of rations. Heavy woolen socks\r\nare indispensable, and an effort should be made to have a dry pair\r\nalways at hand. This may be arranged, even under the most unfavorable\r\nconditions, by drying a pair as thoroughly as is convenient and\r\ncarrying them in the bosom of one's shirt.\r\n\r\nLong alpenstocks are always necessary. My own choice is a stiff one of\r\nhickory, about six feet long and an inch and a quarter in diameter,\r\nprovided with a spike and hook at one end and a chisel about two\r\ninches broad at the other. Ice axes are desirable while climbing in\r\nthe high mountains, but even more serviceable are light axes of the\r\nusual pattern, but with handles about fourteen inches long; these\r\nsupplement the alpenstock, and when not actually in use are carried in\r\nthe packs.\r\n\r\nEach man should be provided with a water-tight match-box, and should\r\nhave, besides, a bundle of wax matches wrapped in oil-cloth and sewed\r\nin the collar of his shirt, to be held as a last reserve. Each man\r\nshould also have a small water-tight bag in which to carry salt enough\r\nto last a week or ten days, in case he has to live by hunting or\r\nfishing. A heavy hunting knife is very convenient, and can be used not\r\nonly in cutting trails through thick brush, but in cases of necessity\r\nis serviceable in making steps in ice. Heavy woolen clothing is\r\npreferable to furs. Sleeping bags were not used during our expedition,\r\nbut are highly recommended by others. For protection at night, a thick\r\nwoolen blanket with a light canvas cover and a sheet of light rubber\r\ncloth to protect it are all that is necessary. Our tents were of\r\ncotton drilling, seven feet square and about six feet high, and {166}\r\nprovided with ridge-ropes. Alpenstocks were used for tent poles.\r\n\"Sou'westers\" and strong water-proof coats are indispensable in a\r\nclimate like that of Alaska, and at night may be used as a substratum\r\non which to sleep. While traveling over the snow-line we used colored\r\nglasses to protect the eyes, and also found that a strip of dark\r\nmosquito netting tied across the face below the eyes afforded great\r\nprotection. Some of the party found relief from the glare of the snow\r\nby blacking their faces with grease and burnt cork, but one experiment\r\nwith that method is usually enough. While camping below timber-line\r\nduring the months of June to September fine mosquito netting is\r\nindispensable. In carrying packs, hemp \"cod-line\" of the largest size\r\nwas found to answer every requirement, and is preferred by expert\r\npackers to pack-straps.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that experienced Swiss guides are necessary to\r\nensure success in climbing Mount St. Elias. Having never followed a\r\nguide in the mountains, I am not able to judge of their efficiency,\r\nbut it must be remembered that no one can _guide_ in a region that has\r\nnever been traversed. The \"guide\" as understood in Europe is unknown\r\nin America. In the exploration of this country by engineers,\r\ngeologists, etc., the camp hands have followed their leaders and have\r\nnot shown them the way. In every frontier town there are hunters,\r\ntrappers, miners, prospectors, cow-boys, voyageurs, etc.--men who have\r\npassed their lives on the plains or among \"the hills\" and are enured\r\nto hardship and danger. This is the best material in the world from\r\nwhich to recruit an exploring party. A foreigner engaging the services\r\nof such men must take into account the independent spirit that\r\nanimates them and is the secret of their usefulness. They are not\r\nservants, but retainers; that too in regions far beyond the reach of\r\ncivil law. They will follow their leader anywhere, support him in all\r\ndangers, and do their work faithfully so long as their rights as men\r\nare respected.\r\n\r\nBy taking proper precautions while traveling across crevassed snow and\r\nice, and guarding against avalanches and snow-blindness, an excursion\r\ncan be made above the snow-line with as little danger as in better\r\nknown and more frequented regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n{167}\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF THE GEOLOGY OF THE ST. ELIAS REGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding narrative, many references have been made to the\r\ncharacter of the rocks and to the geological structure of the region\r\nexplored. It was not practicable during the journey to carry on\r\ndetailed geological studies, but such facts as were noted are of\r\ninterest, for this reason, if for no other: they relate to a country\r\npreviously unknown.\r\n\r\nMy reconnoissance enabled me to determine that there are three\r\nwell-defined formations in the St. Elias region. These are--\r\n\r\n1. The sandstones and shales about Yakutat bay and westward along the\r\nfoot of the mountain to Icy bay, named the _Yakutat system_.\r\n\r\n2. A system of probably later date, composed of shale, conglomerate,\r\nlimestone, sandstone, etc., best exposed in the cliffs of Pinnacle\r\npass and along the northern and western borders of the Samovar hills,\r\nand named the _Pinnacle system_.\r\n\r\n3. The metamorphic rocks of the main St. Elias range, called the _St.\r\nElias schist_.\r\n\r\n\r\nYAKUTAT SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of this system are of gray and brown sandstones and nearly\r\nblack shales. They are uniform in lithological character over a large\r\narea, and are usually greatly crushed and seamed. So great has been\r\nthe crushing to which they have been subjected that it is difficult to\r\nwork out a hand specimen with fresh surfaces. Fragments broken out\r\nwith a hammer are almost invariably bounded by plains of previous\r\ncrushing, and are usually somewhat weathered.\r\n\r\nThese rocks form the bold shores of Yakutat and Disenchantment bays,\r\nand were the only rocks seen along our route from Yakutat bay to\r\nPinnacle pass. The whole of the Hitchcock range is composed of rocks\r\nof this series, as are also the Chaix {168} hills and the hills west\r\nof Icy bay and the southern portion of the Samovar hills. North of\r\nPinnacle pass there are rocks undistinguishable lithogically from\r\nthose about Yakutat bay. These are exposed in Mount Owen and on each\r\nside of Dome pass; they also form the bold spurs about the immediate\r\nbases of Mount Augusta, Mount Malaspina, and Mount St. Elias. In the\r\nthree instances last named these rocks dip beneath the schist forming\r\nthe crest of the St. Elias range, and it is probable that a great\r\noverthrust there took place before the formation of the faults to\r\nwhich the present relief of the mountains is due.\r\n\r\nAll the mountain spurs of Mount Cook, so far as is known, are composed\r\nof sandstones and shales of the Yakutat series, with the exception of\r\nthe Pinnacle pass cliffs. Nearly all the débris on the glaciers from\r\nDisenchantment bay to the Seward glacier, and probably beyond, is\r\nderived from the rocks of this system. The distribution of the rocks\r\nfrom which the débris was derived may be ascertained in a general way\r\nby tracing out the sources of the glaciers. Medial moraines on the\r\nHayden and Marvine glaciers, however, have their sources on the\r\nnorthern slope of Mount Cook, and are composed of gabbro and\r\nserpentine. These rocks were not seen in place, and their relation to\r\nthe Yakutat series can only be conjectured.\r\n\r\nAlthough the rocks of this system are stratified, it is impossible to\r\ndetermine their thickness, for the reason that they have been greatly\r\ncrushed and overthrust. This is well illustrated in the Hitchcock\r\nrange, which, as already explained, trends about northeast and\r\nsouthwest, and is composed of strata of shale and sandstone, having a\r\nnearly east-and-west strike and a uniform dip toward the northeast.\r\nWere the rocks in normal position their thickness would be incredible.\r\nIn addition to this negative evidence, there is the crushed condition\r\nof the strata to show that movement has taken place all through their\r\nmass; and in a few instances thrust faults were distinguished, dipping\r\nnortheastward at about the same angle as the lines of bedding. In the\r\ncrushing to which the rocks have been subjected the shales have\r\nsuffered more than the sandstones, and have been drawn out into\r\nwedge-shaped masses, the sharp edges of which usually point toward the\r\nnortheast, which is presumably the direction from which the crushing\r\nforce acted.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that the rocks in the St. Elias region have been\r\ncrushed and overthrust explains many otherwise {169} inharmonious\r\nfacts, and accounts for the superposition of the St. Elias schist upon\r\nrocks of the Yakutat system.\r\n\r\nCoal has been discovered in the rocks of the Yakutat system about two\r\nmiles west of the southern end of Disenchantment bay, and is reported\r\nto be of workable thickness. I saw thin lignite seams at the surface\r\nat this locality, but as the shafts were filled with water I was\r\nunable to examine the coal in the openings, and cannot vouch for its\r\nthickness. Samples obtained from the mine show it to be a black\r\nlignite which would apparently be of value for fuel. Fossil leaves are\r\nreported to occur in connection with the lignite, but these have never\r\nbeen seen by any one who could identify them.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Yakutat system, wherever seen, dip northeastward,\r\nexcept when greatly disturbed near fault-lines. East of Disenchantment\r\nbay the inclination of the beds is from 15° to 20°; farther westward\r\nthe dip increases gradually all the way to the Hitchcock range, where\r\nthe prevailing inclination is from 30° to 40°, and frequently still\r\ngreater. Beneath Mount Malaspina and Mount St. Elias the Yakutat\r\nsandstones dip northeastward at an angle of about 15°, and in the\r\nhills west of Icy bay the dip is about the same. Exceptions to the\r\nprevailing dips occur along the immediate shore of Yakutat bay,\r\nnorthwest of Knight island, and at the southern extremity of each of\r\nthe mountain spurs between Yakutat bay and Blossom island. At these\r\nlocalities the rocks are frequently vertical or nearly so, owing their\r\nhigh dip to the proximity of lines of displacement. The faults\r\nindicated by these unusual dips also mark the boundary between the\r\nmountains and the seaward-stretching plateau of alluvium and ice.\r\n\r\nThe crushing, overthrusting and faulting that has affected the rocks\r\nof this system render it doubtful whether the coal seams which occur\r\nin it, even if of requisite thickness, can be worked to advantage.\r\nSome of the samples of coal obtained at the openings made near Yakutat\r\nbay were slickensided, showing that movements in the coal seam had\r\nthere taken place.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the rocks of the Yakutat series are remarkably\r\nuniform in character throughout the extent now known, and offer but\r\nlittle variety. The sandstones are intersected in every direction by\r\nthin quartz seams, which stand in relief on the weathered surfaces,\r\ngiving the rocks a peculiar and {170} characteristic appearance. The\r\nfirst important change in the geology along the route traversed by us\r\nwas met on reaching Pinnacle pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINNACLE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of this system, as already stated, are best exposed in the\r\ngreat fault-scarp forming the northern wall of Pinnacle pass. They are\r\nmore varied in composition and have preserved a better record of the\r\nconditions under which they were deposited than the sandstones and\r\nshales of the Yakutat system.\r\n\r\nOnly an approximate section of the rocks exposed in the Pinnacle-pass\r\ncliff was obtained.\r\n\r\n  Sandstone and conglomerate weathering into spires . . .    500 feet.\r\n  Evenly bedded, sandy shale in thin layers . . . . . . .    600  \"\r\n  Coarse conglomerate; bowlders of crystalline rock . . .     50  \"\r\n  Thinly bedded, dark-colored sandstone and shale . . . .    500  \"\r\n  Reddish conglomerate  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     10  \"\r\n  Light-gray sandstone, with thin, irregular coal seams .     40  \"\r\n                                                           -----\r\n    Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  1,800  \"\r\n\r\nThere is also a compact, crystalline, gray limestone near the upper\r\nportion of the series, which escaped notice in the cliffs. At the end\r\nof the Pinnacle-pass cliffs, however, where the rocks are turned\r\nnorthward by the great fault which decides the course of the Seward\r\nglacier, and dip eastward at a high angle, the limestone is well\r\nexposed, and has a thickness of about 50 feet. In many places the\r\nsurfaces of the layers are covered with fragments of large _Pecten_\r\nshells. Associated with the limestone there are reddish shales, much\r\ncrushed and broken, and a peculiar conglomerate. The pebbles in the\r\nconglomerate are of many varieties, and were observed at places along\r\nthe Pinnacle pass cliffs. Their most marked peculiarity lies in the\r\nfact that they have been sheared by a movement in the rocks and\r\nsometimes broken into several fragments which have been reunited,\r\nprobably by pressure. These faulted pebbles are characteristic of the\r\nstrata from which they were derived. Similar pebbles were afterward\r\nobtained in the Marvine glacier near its junction with the Malaspina\r\nglacier, thus indicating that there are other outcrops of the\r\nconglomerate about Mount Cook, near where the Marvine glacier {171}\r\nhas its source. Two quartz pebbles from the conglomerate of Pinnacle\r\npass are shown in the accompanying illustrations. The larger pebble\r\n(shown in figure 7) is of bluish-gray quartz, and the smaller one\r\n(depicted in figure 8) is of white quartz. The fragments into which\r\nthey have been broken are now firmly united. The engravings are\r\nphoto-mechanical (Moss process) reproductions from the objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7--_Faulted Pebble from Pinnacle Pass_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 8--_Faulted Pebble from Pinnacle Pass_.]\r\n\r\nIn the northern and western part of the Samovar hills the rocks of the\r\nPinnacle system again appear, forming a bold angular ridge, curving\r\nsouthward and reaching the border of the Agassiz glacier. The southern\r\nface of this range is precipitous and, like the Pinnacle pass cliffs,\r\nexhibits the edges of northward-dipping strata. Its northern and\r\nwestern slopes are heavily snow-bound. It is in reality a continuation\r\nof the Pinnacle pass fault, but thrown out of line by the cross-fault\r\nwhich marked out the course of the Seward glacier.\r\n\r\nThe Yakutat and Pinnacle systems are so easily recognized that their\r\ndistribution can be distinguished at a glance, when the outcrops are\r\nnot concealed beneath the nearly universal covering of snow. The rocks\r\nof the Yakutat series are heavily bedded sandstones and shales, and\r\nhave in general a light-brown tint; while the rocks of the Pinnacle\r\nseries are thinly bedded and dark in color, appearing black at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a _Pecten_ (_P. caurinus_ (?) Gld.) in the limestone\r\nof the Pinnacle series has already been mentioned. Other fossils were\r\nobtained from sandstones and shales at the crest of the cliffs above\r\nPinnacle pass at an elevation of 5,000 feet. These {172} were\r\nsubmitted to Dr. W. H. Dall, who kindly identified them as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mya arenaria_, L.;\r\n  _Mytilus edulis_, L.;\r\n  _Leda fossa_, Baird, or _L. minuta_, Fabr.;\r\n  _Macoma inconspicua_, B. and S.;\r\n  _Cardium islandicum_, L.;\r\n  _Litorina atkana_, Dall.\r\n\r\nAll of these species are stated by Dall to be still living in the\r\noceanic waters of Alaska. The very recent age of the rocks in which\r\nthey occur is thus established.\r\n\r\nIn strata closely connected with the layers in which these shells were\r\nfound there occur many fine leaf impressions, a few of which were\r\nbrought away. These have been examined by Professor L. F. Ward, who\r\nhas identified them with four species of _Salix_, closely resembling\r\nliving species. The report on these interesting fossils forms Appendix\r\nD.\r\n\r\nThe age indicated by both invertebrates and plants is late Tertiary\r\n(Pliocene) or early Pleistocene. This determination is of great\r\nsignificance when taken in connection with the structure of the\r\nregion, and shows that the mountains in the St. Elias region are\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nNot only was a part, at least, of the Pinnacle system deposited during\r\nthe life of living species of mollusks, but also the whole of the\r\nYakutat series, the stratigraphic position of which is, if my\r\ndetermination is correct, above the Pinnacle system. After the\r\nsediments composing the rocks of these two series were {173} deposited\r\nin the sea as strata of sand, mud, etc., they were consolidated,\r\noverthrust, faulted, and upheaved into one of the grandest mountain\r\nridges on the continent. Then, after the mountains had reached a\r\nconsiderable height, if not their full growth, the snows of winter\r\nfell upon them, and glaciers were born; the glaciers increased to a\r\nmaximum, and their surfaces reached from a thousand to two thousand\r\nfeet higher than now on the more southern mountain spurs, and\r\nafterward slowly wasted away to their present dimensions. All of this\r\ninteresting and varied history has been enacted during the life of\r\nexisting species of plants and animals.\r\n\r\nThe relative age of the Yakutat and Pinnacle series is the weakest\r\npoint in the history sketched above. The facts on which it rests are\r\nas follows: At Pinnacle pass the sandstones and shales forming the\r\nsouthern wall belong to the Yakutat system and are much disturbed,\r\nwhile the northern wall, or the heaved side of the fault, is composed\r\nof the rocks of the Pinnacle system, inclined northward at an angle of\r\n30° or 40°. North of this fault-scarp, in the foothills of Mount Owen,\r\nsandstones and shales, seemingly identical with those of the Yakutat\r\nsystem, again occur, although their direct connection with the rocks\r\nsouth of Pinnacle pass was not observed, owing to the snow that\r\nobscured the outcrops. Again at Dome pass a similar relation seems\r\nevident, but cannot be directly established. The immediate foothills\r\nof Mounts Augusta, Malaspina, and St. Elias are also of sandstone,\r\nlithologically the same as the Yakutat series. The conclusion that the\r\nYakutat system is younger than the Pinnacle-pass rocks was reached in\r\nthe field after many other hypotheses had been tried and found\r\nwanting, and to my mind it explains all the observations made. Even\r\nshould the supposed relations of the two series under discussion be\r\nreversed, it would still be true that a very large part of the rocks\r\nof the St. Elias region were deposited since the appearance of living\r\nspecies of mollusks and plants, and that the prevailing structure of\r\nthe region was imposed at a still later date. This will appear more\r\nclearly after examining the structure of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. ELIAS SCHIST.\r\n\r\nThe rock forming several thousand feet of the upper portion of the St.\r\nElias range is a schist in which the planes of bedding {174} are\r\npreserved. The dip of the strata is northeastward, and has exerted a\r\ndecided influence on the weathering of the mountain crests. As the\r\nopportunities for examining this formation were unsatisfactory, a\r\ndetailed account of it will not now be attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE.\r\n\r\nThe abnormal thickness of the Yakutat series, due to crushing and\r\noverthrust, has been referred to, as has also the superposition of the\r\nSt. Elias schist upon rock supposed to belong to the Yakutat system.\r\n\r\nThe plane of contact between the sandstone and the overlying schist of\r\nthe St. Elias range dips northeastward at an angle of about 15°,\r\ncorresponding, as nearly as can be determined, with the dip of the\r\nstrata in the sandstone itself. All of the observations made in this\r\nconnection indicate that the schist has been overthrust upon the\r\nsandstones. After this took place the great faults to which the range\r\nowes its present relief were formed.\r\n\r\nAbout Mount Cook, however, and in the elevated plateau east of Yakutat\r\nbay, the conditions are different from those observed along the base\r\nof the St. Elias range. The only displacements known in the Yakutat\r\nsystem south and east of Pinnacle pass is the great fault which\r\npresumably exists where the rocks of the foothills disappear beneath\r\nthe gravel and glaciers of the Piedmont region, the faults referred to\r\nbelonging to the same series as those which determine the southern and\r\nsouthwestern borders of the St. Elias range and many of the foothills\r\nsouth of the main escarpment. Besides the great faults which trend\r\nfrom St. Elias toward the northeast and northwest, there are several\r\ncross-faults, one of which determines the position of the Seward\r\nglacier through a portion of its course, while another marks out the\r\npath of the Agassiz glacier; and two others may be recognized just\r\neast of the summit of St. Elias, which have dropped portions of the\r\neastern end of the orographic block forming the crowning peak of the\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nThe southern face of Mount St. Elias is a fault-scarp. The mountain\r\nitself is formed by the upturned edge of a faulted block in which the\r\nstratification is inclined northeastward. As has just been mentioned,\r\nthe mountain stands at the intersection of two lines of displacement,\r\none trending in a northeasterly and the other in a northwesterly\r\ndirection. The one trending {175} northwestward extends beyond the end\r\nof the northeast fault. The point of union is at the pass between\r\nMount St. Elias and Mount Newton. The upturned block, bounded on the\r\nsouthwest by a great fault, projects beyond the junction with the\r\nnortheasterly fault. It is this projecting end of a roof-like block\r\nthat forms Mount St. Elias. That this is the case may be clearly seen\r\nwhen viewing the mountain from the glacier near the base of Mount\r\nOwen. Such a view is shown on plate 20. The crest-line of St. Elias\r\nextends with a decreasing grade northwestward from the culminating\r\npeak, and the northern slope of the ridge is the surface of the tilted\r\nblock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 20. MT. ST. ELIAS, FROM THE SEWARD GLACIER.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated already, it will be seen that the St. Elias\r\nrange is young. Its upheaval, as indicated by our present knowledge,\r\nwas since the close of the Tertiary. The breaking of the rocks and\r\ntheir upheaval is an event of such recent date that erosion has\r\nscarcely modified the forms which the mountains had at their birth.\r\nThe formation of glaciers followed the elevation of the region so\r\nquickly, that there was no opportunity for streams to act. The ice\r\ndrainage is consequent upon the geological structure, and has made but\r\nslight changes in the topography due to that structure.\r\n\r\nAbout Mount Cook, and in the elevated plateau east of Yakutat bay,\r\nthere has been deeper erosion than about Mount St. Elias. The glaciers\r\nin this region occupy deep valleys radiating from the higher peaks;\r\nbut whether these are really valleys of erosion is not definitely\r\nknown. In some instances, changes of dip on opposite sides of the\r\nvalleys indicate that they may in part be due to faulting; but, owing\r\nprincipally to the fact that every basin has its glacier, it has not\r\nbeen practicable, up to the present time, to determine how they were\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThe crests of the mountains are always sharp and angular, by reason of\r\nthe rapid weathering of their exposed summits, but while\r\ndisintegration is rapid, no evidences of pronounced decay are\r\nnoticeable. The peaks on the summits of the St. Elias range are either\r\npyramids or roof-like crests with triangular gables. These forms have\r\nresulted from the weathering of schist in which the planes of bedding\r\nare crossed by lines of jointing.\r\n\r\n\r\n{176}\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nGLACIERS OF THE ST. ELIAS REGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL DIVISIONS OF GLACIERS.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers of the St. Elias region form two groups. The ice-streams\r\nfrom the mountain are of the type found in Switzerland, and hence\r\ntermed _Alpine glaciers_. The great plateau of ice along the ocean\r\nformed by the union and expansion of Alpine glaciers from the\r\nmountains belongs to a class not previously described, but which in\r\nthis paper have been called _Piedmont glaciers_. The representative of\r\nthe latter type between Yakutat bay and Icy bay is the Malaspina\r\nglacier. Both types are to be distinguished from _Continental\r\nglaciers_.\r\n\r\n\r\nALPINE GLACIERS.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers in the mountains are all of one type, but present great\r\ndiversity in their secondary features, and might be separated into\r\nthree or four subordinate divisions. The great trunk glaciers have\r\nmany tributaries, and drain the snows from the mountains through broad\r\nchannels, which are of low grade throughout all the lower portions of\r\ntheir courses. Besides the trunk glaciers and the secondary glaciers\r\nwhich flow into them, there are many smaller glaciers which do not\r\njoin the main streams, but terminate in the gorges or on the exposed\r\nmountain sides in which they originate. These have nearly all the\r\nfeatures of the larger streams, but are not of sufficient volume to\r\nbecome rivers of ice.\r\n\r\nA minor division of Alpine glaciers for which it is convenient to have\r\na special name includes those that end in the sea and, breaking off,\r\nform icebergs. These may be designated as \"tide-water glaciers.\"\r\nTypical examples of this class are furnished by the Dalton and Hubbard\r\nglaciers, but other ice-streams having the same characteristics occur\r\nin Glacier bay, in Taku inlet, and at the heads of several of the deep\r\nfjords along the coast of southeastern Alaska.\r\n\r\n{177} A noticeable feature of the Alpine glaciers of Alaska is that\r\nthey expand on passing beyond the valleys through which they flow and\r\nform delta-like accumulations of ice on the plains below. This\r\nexpansion takes place irrespective of the direction in which the\r\nglaciers flow, and, so far as may be judged from the many examples\r\nexamined, is independent of the débris that covers them. It should be\r\nremembered, however, that none of the Alaskan glaciers thus far\r\nstudied show marked inequalities in the distribution of the moraines\r\nupon their surfaces. Should one side of a glacier, on leaving a cañon,\r\nbe heavily loaded with marginal moraines, while the opposite border\r\nwas unprotected, it is to be presumed that a deflection of the ice\r\nwould take place similar to the change in direction recorded by the\r\nmoraines about Mono lake, California.[34] The normal tendency of ice,\r\nwhen not confined, to expand in all directions and form a plateau is\r\nillustrated on a grand scale by the Malaspina glacier.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Eighth Ann. Rept. U. S. Geol. Surv., 1889, part I, pp.\r\n360-366.]\r\n\r\nThe most important ice-streams about Mount St. Elias and Mount Cook\r\nare indicated on the map forming plate 8. The Tindall, Guyot, and\r\nLibbey glaciers and the lower part of the Agassiz glacier there\r\nrepresented are taken from a map published by H. W. Topham.[35] All of\r\nthe other glaciers indicated on the map were hastily surveyed during\r\nthe present expedition and are described to some extent in the\r\naccompanying narrative. By far the most important of these is the one\r\nnamed the Seward Glacier.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Alpine Journal, London, vol. XIV, 1887, pl. op. p. 359.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Seward Glacier is of the Alpine type, and is the largest tributary\r\nof the Malaspina glacier. Its length is approximately 40 miles, and\r\nits width in the narrowest part, opposite Camp fourteen, is about 3\r\nmiles. The main amphitheatre from which its drainage is derived is\r\nnorth of Mount Owen and between Mount Irving and Mount Logan. The\r\ngeneral surface of the broad level floor of this névé field has an\r\nelevation of approximately 5,000 feet. The snow from the northern and\r\nwestern sides of Mount Irving, from the northern slope of Mount Owen,\r\nand from numerous valleys and cañons in the vast semicircle of\r\ntowering peaks joining these two mountains, unite to form the great\r\nglacier. There is another amphitheatre between Mount Owen and the\r\nPinnacle pass cliffs supplied principally by snows {178} from the\r\nnorthwestern slope of Mount Cook, which sends a vast flood of ice and\r\nsnow into the main drainage channel. Other tributary glaciers descend\r\nthe steep slopes of Mount Augusta and Mount Malaspina, and a lesser\r\ntributary flows eastward from Dome pass. All of these ice-drainage\r\nlines converge toward the narrow outlet of Camp 14 (plate 8) and\r\ndischarge southward down a moderately steep descent several miles in\r\nlength. Below Camp 14 there are other névé fields bordering the\r\nglacier, which contribute no insignificant amount of ice and snow to\r\nits mass. Between the extremity of the Hitchcock range and the Samovar\r\nhills the path of the glacier is again contracted and greatly broken\r\nas it descends to the plateau below.\r\n\r\nThe Seward glacier, like all ice rivers of its class, has its névé\r\nregion above, and its ice region below. The limit between the two is\r\nthe lower margin of the summer snow, and occurs just above the\r\nice-fall between the southern extremity of the Hitchcock range and the\r\nSamovar hills. All the névé region is pure white and without moraines,\r\nexcept at the immediate bases of the most precipitous cliffs. At the\r\nbases of the Corwin cliffs, which rise fully 2,000 feet above its\r\nborder, no débris can be distinguished even in midsummer. An absence\r\nof moraines along the base of Pinnacle pass cliffs was also noticed\r\nduring our first visit, but when we returned over the same route in\r\nSeptember the melting of the snow had revealed many large patches of\r\ndirt and disintegrated rock. In several places near the bases of steep\r\ncliffs, strata of dirty ice, containing many stones, were observed in\r\ndeep crevasses. It was evident that vast quantities of débris were\r\nsealed up in the ice along the borders of the glacier, only to appear\r\nat the surface far down the stream where summer melting exceeds the\r\nwinter accumulation.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the glacier below the lower fall is composed of solid\r\nice with blue and white bands, and has broad moraines along its\r\nborders. The course of the glacier, after entering the great plateau\r\nof ice to which it is tributary, may be traced for many miles by the\r\nbands of débris along its sides. These moraines belong to the\r\nMalaspina glacier, and have already been referred to.\r\n\r\nAt the outlet of the upper amphitheatre, about 6 miles above Mount\r\nOwen, there is an ice-fall which extends completely across the\r\nglacier. Below the pinnacles and crevasses formed by this fall the ice\r\nis recemented and flows on with a broad, gently {179} descending\r\nsurface, gashed, however, by thousands of crevasses, as shown in plate\r\n20, to the end of the Pinnacle pass cliffs. It there finds a more\r\nrapid descent, and becomes crevassed in an interesting way. The slope\r\nis not sufficient to be termed a fall, but causes a rapid in the\r\nice-stream.\r\n\r\nThe change of grade in the bed of the glacier is first felt about a\r\nmile above Camp 14. A series of crevasses there begins, which extends\r\nfour or five miles down-stream. At first the cracks are narrow, and\r\ntrend upstream in the manner usual with marginal crevasses. Soon the\r\ncracks from the opposite sides meet in the center and form a single\r\ncrevasse, bending upstream in the middle. A little lower down, the\r\ncrevasse becomes straight, showing that the ice in the center of the\r\ncurrent flows more rapidly than at the sides. The more rapid movement\r\nof the center is indicated by the form of the crevasses all the way\r\ndown the rapid. After becoming straight they bow in the center and\r\nform semi-lunar gashes, widest in the center and curving up-stream at\r\neach extremity. Still farther down they become more and more bent in\r\nthe center and at the same time greatly increased in breadth. Still\r\nlower the curve becomes an angle and the crevasses are V-shaped, the\r\narrow-like point directed down-stream. These parallel V-shaped gashes\r\nset in order, one in front of the other, are what gives the glacier\r\nthe appearance of \"watered\" ribbon when seen from a distance.\r\n\r\nWith the change in direction and curvature of the crevasses, there is\r\nan accompanying change in color. The cracks in the upper part of the\r\nrapid are in a white surface and run down into ice that looks dark and\r\nblue by contrast. Lower down, as the cracks increase in width, broad\r\nwhite tables are left between them. Cross-fractures are formed, and\r\nthe sides of the table begin to crumble in and fill up the gaps\r\nbetween. As the surface melts the tables lose their pure whiteness and\r\nbecome dust-covered and yellow; but the blocks falling into the\r\ncrevasses expose fresh surfaces, and fill the gulfs with pure white\r\nice. In this way the color of the sides of the crevasses changes from\r\ndeep blue to white, while the general surface loses its purity and\r\nbecomes dust-covered. Far down the rapid where the V-shaped crevasses\r\nare most pointed, the tables have crumbled away and filled up the\r\ngulfs between, so that the watered-ribbon pattern is distinguished by\r\ncolor alone. The scars of the crevasses formed above are shown by\r\nwhite bands on a dark dust-covered {180} surface. Before the lower\r\nfall is reached nearly all traces of the thousands of fissures formed\r\nin the rapids above have disappeared.\r\n\r\nOn looking down on the rapids from any commanding point, the definite\r\narrangement of the crevasses along the center of the ice-stream at\r\nonce attracts attention, and their order suggests a rapid central\r\ncurrent in the stream.\r\n\r\nBelow Camp 14, for at least two or three miles, as well as at many\r\nplaces above that point, the Seward glacier flows between banks of\r\nsnow. Along its border there are marginal crevasses trending\r\nup-stream, and in the adjacent banks there are similar breaks trending\r\ndown-stream. Where the two systems meet there is a line of irregular\r\ncrevasses, exceedingly difficult to cross, which mark the actual\r\nborder of the flowing ice. A similar arrangement of marginal crevasses\r\nand of shore crevasses has been referred to in connection with the\r\nMarvine glacier, and was observed in many other instances.\r\n\r\nWhile occupying Camp 14 we could hear the murmur of waters far down in\r\nthe glacier below our tent, but there were no surface streams visible.\r\nCrashing and rumbling noises made by the slowly moving ice frequently\r\nattracted our attention, and sometimes at night we would be awakened\r\nby a dull thud, accompanied by a trembling of the rocks beneath us, as\r\nif a slight earthquake had occurred. Occasionally a pinnacle of ice\r\nwould fall and be engulfed in the crevasses at its base. These\r\nevidences of change indicated that movements in the Seward glacier\r\nwere constantly in progress. A short base-line was measured and sights\r\ntaken to well-marked points in the Seward glacier for the purpose of\r\nmeasuring its motion. The angles between the base-line and lines of\r\nsight to the chosen points were read on several successive days, but\r\nwhen these observations were compared they gave discrepant results.\r\nThe measurements which seemed most reliable indicate that the central\r\npart of the ice-stream has a movement of about twenty feet a day. This\r\nis to be taken only as an approximation, which needs to be verified\r\nbefore much weight can be attached to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF ALPINE GLACIERS ABOVE THE SNOW-LINE.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the névé is white, except near its lower limit in late\r\nsummer, where it frequently becomes covered with dust {181} blown from\r\nneighboring cliffs. It is almost entirely free from moraines, but at\r\nthe bases of steep slopes small areas of débris sometimes appear at\r\nthe surface when the yearly melting has reached its maximum. The\r\nabsence of moraines is accompanied by an absence of glacial tables,\r\nsand-cones and other details of glacial surfaces due to differential\r\nmelting. Streams seldom appear at the surface, for the reason that\r\nusually the water produced by surface melting is quickly absorbed by\r\nthe porous strata beneath; yet the crevasses are frequently filled\r\nwith water, and sometimes shallow lakes of deep blue occur at the\r\nbottoms of the amphitheatres and form a marked contrast to the even\r\nwhite of the general surface. Crevasses are present or absent\r\naccording to the slope of the surface on which the névé rests. In the\r\ncrevasses the edges of horizontal layers of granular ice are\r\nexhibited, showing that the névé down to a depth of at least one or\r\ntwo hundred feet is horizontally stratified. In the St. Elias region\r\nthe strata are most frequently from ten to fifteen feet thick, but in\r\na few instances layers without partings over fifty feet thick were\r\nseen. The surface is always of white, granular ice, but in the\r\ncrevasses the layers near the bottom appear more compact and bluer in\r\ncolor than those near the surface.\r\n\r\nSome of the most striking features of the névé are due to the\r\ncrevasses that break their surfaces. The orderly arrangement of\r\nmarginal crevasses and of the interior crevasses at the rapids in the\r\nSeward glacier have already been referred to; but there are still\r\nother crevasses, especially in the broad, gently sloping portions of\r\nthe snow-fields where the motion is slight, which, although less\r\nregular in their arrangement, are fully as interesting. The crevasses\r\non such slopes generally run at right angles to the direction in which\r\nthe snow is moving. On looking down on such a surface, the breaks look\r\nlike long clear-cut gashes which have stretched open in the center,\r\nbut taper to a sharp point at each end. The ability of the névé ice to\r\nstretch to a limited extent is thus clearly shown. The initiation of\r\nthe crevasses seems to be due to the movement of the névé ice over a\r\nsurface in which there are inequalities of such magnitude that the ice\r\ncannot stretch sufficiently to allow it to accommodate itself to them,\r\nso that strains are produced which result in fractures at right angles\r\nto the line of general movement. Crevasses found where the grade is\r\ngentle vary from a fraction of an inch to 10 or 15 feet in width, and\r\nare sometimes two or three {182} thousand feet long. Broader gulfs are\r\nseldom formed unless the slope has an inclination of 15° or 20°.\r\n\r\nThe grandest crevasses are in the higher portions of the névé, and\r\noccur especially on the borders of the great amphitheatres. In such\r\nsituations the crevasses are usually fewer in number but are of\r\ngreater size than in equal areas lower down. A length of three or four\r\nthousand feet and a breadth of fifty feet or more is not uncommon. The\r\nfinest and most characteristic glacial scenery is found among these\r\ngreat cañon-like breaks. Standing on the border of one of the gulfs,\r\nas near the brink as one cares to venture, their full depth cannot\r\nusually be seen. In some instances they are partially filled with\r\nwater of the deepest blue, in which the ice-walls are reflected with\r\nsuch wonderful distinctness that it is impossible to tell where the\r\nice ends and its counterfeit begins. The walls of the crevasses are\r\nmost frequently sheer cliffs of stratified ice, with occasional\r\nornamentations, formed of ice-crystals or a pendent icicle. After a\r\nstorm they are frequently decorated in the most beautiful manner with\r\nfretwork and cornice of snow. The bridges spanning the crevasses are\r\nusually diagonal slivers of ice left where the clefts overlap; but at\r\ntimes, especially in the case of the larger crevasses, there are true\r\narches resembling the Natural Bridge of Virginia, but on a larger\r\nscale, spanning the blue cañons and adding greatly to their strange,\r\nfairy-like beauty. The most striking feature of these cracks is their\r\nwonderful color. All tints, from the pure white of their crystal lips\r\ndown to the deepest blue of their innermost recesses, are revealed in\r\neach gash and rent in the hardened snow.\r\n\r\nAbove the snow-line all of the mountain tops that are not precipitous\r\nare heavily loaded with snow. Where the snow breaks off at the verge\r\nof a precipice and descends in avalanches a depth of more than a\r\nhundred feet is frequently revealed, but in the valleys and\r\namphitheatres the snow has far greater thickness. Pinnacles and crests\r\nof rock, rising through the icy covering, indicate that the thickness\r\nof the névé must be many hundreds of feet.\r\n\r\nThere are no evidences of former glaciation on the mountain crests\r\nwhich project above the névé fields. There are no polished and\r\nstriated rock surfaces or glaciated domes to indicate that the\r\nmountains were ever covered by a general capping of ice, as has been\r\npostulated for similar mountains elsewhere. When the {183} glaciers\r\nhad their greatest expansion the higher mountains were in about their\r\npresent condition. The increase in the volume of the glaciers was felt\r\nalmost entirely in their lower courses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF ALPINE GLACIERS BELOW THE SNOW-LINE.\r\n\r\nThe first feature that attracts attention on descending from the névé\r\nregion to the more icy portion of the glaciers is the rapid melting\r\neverywhere taking place. Every day during the summer the murmur and\r\nroar of rills, brooks and rivers are to be heard in all of the\r\nice-fields. The surface streams are usually short, on account of the\r\ncrevasses which intercept them. They plunge into the gulfs, which are\r\nmany times widened out by the flowing waters so as to form wells, or\r\n_moulins_, and join the general drainage beneath. The streams then\r\nflow either through caverns in the glaciers or in tunnels at the\r\nbottoms. While traversing the glacier one may frequently hear the\r\nsubdued roar of rivers coursing along in the dark chambers beneath\r\nwhen no other indication of their existence appears at the surface.\r\nWhen these subglacial streams emerge, usually near the margin of the\r\nice, they issue from archways forming the ends of tunnels, and perhaps\r\nflow for a mile or two in the sunlight before plunging into another\r\ntunnel to continue their way as before.\r\n\r\nThe best example of a glacial river seen during our exploration was\r\nnear the western border of the Lucia glacier. It is shown in the\r\nillustration forming plate 12, which is reproduced mechanically from a\r\nphotograph. This Styx of the ice-world has been described on an\r\nearlier page. The lakes formed at the southern end of nearly every\r\nmountain spur projecting into the Malaspina glacier discharge through\r\ntunnels in the ice, which are similar in every way to those formed by\r\nthe stream already mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the beds of the glacial streams there are deposits of sand and\r\ngravel, and when the streams expand into lakes these deposits are\r\nspread over their bottoms in more or less regular sheets. When streams\r\nfrom the mountains empty into the lakes, deltas are formed. While\r\nthese deltas have the same characteristics as those built in more\r\nstable water bodies, many changes in detail occur, owing to the\r\nfluctuation of the water level.\r\n\r\n{184} One of the tunnels leading to a dry lake-bed at the end of the\r\nHitchcock range was explored for several rods and found to be a high,\r\narching cavern following a tortuous course, and large enough to allow\r\none to drive a coach and four through it without danger of collision.\r\nIts floor was formed of gravel and bowlders, and its arching roof was\r\nclear ice. Here and there the courses of crevasses could be traced by\r\nthe stones and finer débris that had fallen in from above, giving the\r\nappearance of veins in a mine. The deposit on the floor of the tunnel\r\nrested upon ice, and would certainly be greatly disturbed and broken\r\nup before reaching a final resting place in case the glacier should\r\nmelt. In the lake basins, also, the sand and gravel forming their\r\nbottoms frequently rested upon substrata of ice, and are greatly\r\ndisturbed when the ice melts.\r\n\r\nAt the ends of the glaciers the subglacial and intraglacial drainage\r\nissues from tunnels and forms muddy streams. These usually flow out\r\nfrom the foot of a precipice of ice, down which rills are continually\r\ntrickling. The streams flowing away from the glaciers are usually\r\nrapid, owing to the high grade of their built-up channels, and sweep\r\naway large quantities of débris which is deposited along their\r\ncourses. The streams widen and bifurcate as they flow seaward, and\r\nspread vast quantities of bowlders, sand, and gravel over the country\r\nto the right and left, not infrequently invading the forests and\r\nburying the still upright trees. The deposits formed by the streams\r\nare of the nature of alluvial fans, over which the waters meander in a\r\nthousand channels. Where this action has taken place long enough the\r\nalluvial fans end in deltas; but should there be a current in the sea,\r\nthe débris is carried away and formed into beaches and bars along\r\nadjacent shores. Should these glaciers disappear, it is evident that\r\nthese great bowlder washes would form peculiar topographic features,\r\nunsupported at the apexes, and it might be perplexing to determine\r\nfrom whence came the waters that deposited them. I am not aware that\r\nsimilar washes have been recognized along the southern border of the\r\nLaurentide glaciers, but they should certainly be expected to occur\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAnother very striking difference in the appearance of the glaciers\r\nabove and below the snow-line is due to the prevalence of débris on\r\nthe lower portion. The melting that takes place {185} below the\r\nsnow-line removes the ice and leaves the rocks. In this manner the\r\nstones previously concealed in the névé are concentrated at the\r\nsurface, and finally form sheets of débris many miles in extent. So\r\nfar as my observations go, there is nothing to indicate that stones\r\nare brought to the surface by any other means than the one here\r\nsuggested. Upward currents in the ice that would bring stones to the\r\nsurface have been postulated by certain writers, but nothing\r\nsustaining such an hypothesis has been found in Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe moraines on the lower extremities of the Alpine glaciers may\r\nfrequently be separated into individual ridges, which in many\r\ninstances would furnish instructive studies; but in no case has the\r\nhistory of these accumulations been worked out in detail.\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of moraines at the surface come a great variety of\r\nphenomena due to unequal melting. Ridges of ice sheathed with débris,\r\nglacial tables, sand cones, etc., everywhere attract the attention;\r\nbut these features are very similar on all glaciers where the summer's\r\nwaste exceeds the winter's increase, and have been many times\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe general distribution of the moraines of the lower portion of the\r\nAlpine glaciers of the St. Elias region merits attention. The moraines\r\nthemselves exhibit features not yet observed in other regions. From\r\nDisenchantment bay westward to the Seward glacier the lower portions\r\nof the ice-streams are covered and concealed by sheets of débris.\r\nAbout their margins the débris fields support luxuriant vegetation,\r\nand not infrequently are so densely clothed with flowers that a tint\r\nis given to their rugged surfaces. On the extreme outer margins of the\r\nmoraines there are sometimes thickets and forests so dense as to be\r\nalmost impenetrable. The best example of forest-covered moraines\r\nresting on living glaciers, however, is found along the borders of the\r\nMalaspina ice-field.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIEDMONT GLACIERS.\r\n\r\nThis type is represented in the region explored by the Malaspina\r\nglacier. This is a plateau of ice having an area of between 500 and\r\n600 square miles, and a surface elevation in the central part of\r\nbetween 1,500 and 1,600 feet. It is fed by the Agassiz, Seward,\r\nMarvine, and Hayden glaciers, and is of such volume that {186} it has\r\napparently displaced the sea and holds it back by a wall of débris\r\ndeposited about its margin. All of its central portion is of clear\r\nwhite ice, and around all its margins, excepting where the Agassiz and\r\nSeward glaciers come in, it is bounded by a fringe of débris and by\r\nmoraines resting on the ice. Along the seaward border the belt of\r\nfringing moraines is about five miles broad. The inner margin of the\r\nmoraine belt is composed of rocks and dirt, without vegetation, and\r\nseparated more or less completely into belts by strips of clear ice.\r\nOn going from the clear ice toward the margin of the glacier one finds\r\nshrubs and flowers scattered here and there over the surface. Farther\r\nseaward the vegetation becomes more dense and the flowers cover the\r\nwhole surface, giving it the appearance of a luxuriant meadow. Still\r\nfarther toward the margin dense clumps of alder, with scattered spruce\r\ntrees, become conspicuous, while on the outer margin spruce trees of\r\nlarger size form a veritable forest. That this vegetation actually\r\ngrows on the moraines above a living glacier is proved beyond all\r\nquestion by holes and crevasses which reveal the ice beneath. The\r\ncurious lakes scattered abundantly over the moraine-covered areas, and\r\noccupying hour-glass-shaped depressions in the ice, have already been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nFrom the southern end of the Samovar hills, where the Seward and\r\nAgassiz glaciers unite, there is a compound moraine stretching\r\nsouthward, which divides at its distal extremity and forms great\r\ncurves and swirl-like figures indicating currents in the glacier.\r\n\r\nAll the central part of the plateau is, as already stated, of clear\r\nwhite ice, free from moraines; at a distance it has the appearance of\r\na broad snow surface. This is due to the fact that the ice is melted\r\nand honey-combed during the warm summer and the surface becomes\r\nvesicular and loses its banded structure. A rough, coral-like crust,\r\ndue to the freezing of the portions melted during the day, frequently\r\ncovers large areas and resembles a thick hoar-frost. Crevasses are\r\nnumerous, but seldom more than a few feet deep. They appear to be the\r\nlower portions of deep crevasses in the tributary streams which have\r\npartially closed, or else not completely removed by the melting and\r\nevaporation of the surface.\r\n\r\nMany of the crevasses are filled with water, but there are no surface\r\nstreams and no lakes. Melting is rapid during the warm {187} summer\r\ndays, but the water finds its way down into the glacier and joins the\r\ngeneral subglacial drainage. It is evident that the streams beneath\r\nthe surface must be of large size, as they furnish the only means of\r\nescape for the waters flowing beneath the Agassiz, Seward and Marvine\r\nglaciers, as well as for the waters formed by the melting of the great\r\nMalaspina glacier.\r\n\r\nThe outer borders of the Malaspina glacier are practically stationary,\r\nbut there are currents in its central part. Like the expanded ends of\r\nsome of the Alpine glaciers, as the Galiano and Lucia glaciers, for\r\nexample, this glacier is of the nature of a delta of ice, analogous in\r\nmany of its features to river deltas. As a stream in meandering over\r\nits delta builds up one portion after another, so the currents in an\r\nexpanded ice-foot may now follow one direction and deposit loads of\r\ndébris, and then slowly change so as to occupy other positions. This\r\naction tends to destroy the individuality of morainal belts and to\r\nform general sheets of débris. The presence of such currents as here\r\nsuggested has not been proved by measurements, but the great swirls in\r\nthe Malaspina glacier and the tongues of clear ice in the upper\r\nportions of the débris fields on the smaller glaciers strongly suggest\r\ntheir existence.\r\n\r\nThe Malaspina glacier is evidently not eroding its bed; any records\r\nthat it is making must be by deposition. Should the glacier melt away\r\ncompletely, it is evident that a surface formed of glacial débris, and\r\nvery similar to that now existing in the forested plateau east of\r\nYakutat bay, would be revealed.\r\n\r\nThe former extent of the Malaspina glacier cannot be determined, but\r\nit is probable that during its greatest expansion it extended seaward\r\nuntil deep water was reached, and broke off in bergs in the same\r\nmanner as do the Greenland glaciers at the present day. Soundings in\r\nthe adjacent waters might possibly determine approximately the former\r\nposition of the ice-front, and it is possible that submarine moraines\r\nmight be discovered in this way. The Pimpluna reefs, reported by\r\nRussian navigators and indicated on many maps, may possibly be a\r\nremnant of the moraine left by the Piedmont glacier from the adjacent\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers west of Icy bay were seen from the top of Pinnacle pass\r\ncliffs, and are evidently of the same character as the Malaspina\r\nglacier and fully as extensive. A study of these {188} Piedmont\r\nglaciers will certainly throw much light on the interpretations of the\r\nglacial records over northeastern North America. Their value in this\r\nconnection is enhanced by the fact that they are now retreating and\r\nmaking deposits rather than removing previous geological records.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe expedition of last summer was a hasty reconnoissance, during which\r\nbut little detail work could be undertaken. The actual study of the\r\nice-fields of the St. Elias region remains for those who come later.\r\n\r\n\r\n{189}\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nHEIGHT AND POSITION OF MOUNT ST. ELIAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe height and position of Mount St. Elias have been measured several\r\ntimes during the past century with varying results. The measurements\r\nmade prior to the expedition of 1890 have been summarized and\r\ndiscussed by W. H. Dall, of the United States Coast and Geodetic\r\nSurvey, and little more can be done at present than give an abstract\r\nof his report.\r\n\r\nThe various determinations are shown in the table below. The data from\r\nwhich these results were obtained have not been published, with the\r\nexception of the surveys made by the United States Coast Survey in\r\n1874, printed in report of the superintendent for 1875.\r\n\r\n  _Height and Position of Mount St. Elias_.\r\n\r\n  -----+--------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n  Date.|     Authority.     |   Height.   |  Latitude.  | Longitude W.\r\n  -----+--------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n  1786 | La Pérouse         | 12,672 feet | 60° 15' 00\" | 140° 10' 00\"\r\n  1791 | Malaspina          | 17,851  \"   | 60  17  35  | 140  52  17\r\n  1794 | Vancouver          | ----------- | 60  22  30  | 140  39  00\r\n  1847 | Russian Hydrogra-  |             |             |\r\n       |   phic Chart 1378  | 17,854  \"   | 60  21  00  | 141  00  00\r\n  1847 | Tebenkof (Notes)   | 16,938  \"   | 60  22  36  | 140  54  00\r\n  1849 | Tebenkof           |             |             |\r\n       |   (Chart VII)      | 16,938  \"   | 60  21  30  | 140  54  00\r\n       | Buch.

Some preliminary publications of elevations have been made,\r\nbut these must be taken as approximations merely.[37]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: The shore-line of the map, plate 8, and the positions of\r\nthe initial points or base-line of the triangulation are from the work\r\nof the United States Coast Survey. The extreme western portion is from\r\nmaps published by the New York _Times_ and Topham expeditions. All the\r\ntopographic data are by Mr. Kerr, and all credit for the work and all\r\nresponsibility for its accuracy rest with him. The nomenclature is\r\nprincipally my own, and has been approved by a committee of the\r\nNational Geographic Society.]\r\n\r\nBy consulting the map forming plate 8 it will be seen that Mounts\r\nCook, Vancouver, Irving, Owen, etc., are not in the St. Elias range.\r\nNeither do they form a distinct range either topographically or\r\ngeologically. Each of these mountains is an independent uplift,\r\nalthough they may have some structural connection, and are of about\r\nthe same geological age. Mount Cook and the peaks most intimately\r\nassociated with it are composed mainly of sandstone and shale\r\nbelonging to the Yakutat system. Mounts Vancouver and Irving are\r\nprobably of the same character, but definite proof that this is the\r\ncase has not been obtained.\r\n\r\nThe St. Elias uplift is distinct and well marked, both geologically\r\nand topographically, and deserves to be considered as a mountain\r\nrange. The limits of the range have not been determined, but, so far\r\nas known, its maximum elevation is at Mount St. Elias. The range\r\nstretches away from this culminating point both northeastward and\r\nnorthwestward, and has a well-marked V-shape. The angle formed by the\r\ntwo branches of the range where they unite at Mount St. Elias is, by\r\nestimate, about 140°. Each arm of the V is determined by a fault, or\r\nperhaps more accurately by a series of faults having the same general\r\ncourse, along which the orographic blocks forming the range have been\r\nupheaved. The structure of the range is monoclinal, and {191}\r\nresembles the type of mountain structure characteristic of the great\r\nbasin. The dip of the tilted blocks is northward.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the St. Elias range, as already stated, is composed of\r\nschists which rest on sandstone, supposed to belong to the Yakutat\r\nsystem. The geological age of the uplift is, therefore, very recent.\r\nThe secondary topographic forms on the crest of the range have\r\nresulted from the weathering of the upturned edges of orographic\r\nblocks in which the bedding planes are crossed by joints. The\r\nresulting forms are mainly pyramids and roof-like ridges with\r\ntriangular gables. Extreme ruggedness and angularity characterize the\r\nrange throughout. There are no rounded domes or smoothed and polished\r\nsurfaces to suggest that the higher summits have ever been subjected\r\nto general glacial action; neither is there any evidence of marked\r\nrock decay. Disintegration of all the higher peaks and crests is\r\nrapid, owing principally to great changes of temperature and the\r\nfreezing of water in the interstices of the rock; but the débris\r\nresulting from this action is rapidly carried away by avalanches and\r\nglaciers, so that the crests as well as the subordinate features in\r\nthe sculpture of the cliffs and pyramids are all angular. The subdued\r\nand rounded contour, due to the accumulation of the products of\r\ndisintegration and decay, the indications of the advancing age of\r\nmountains, are nowhere to be seen. The St. Elias range is young;\r\nprobably the very youngest of the important mountain ranges on this\r\ncontinent. No evidences of erosion previous to the formation of the\r\nice-sheets that now clothe it have been observed. Glaciers apparently\r\ntook immediate possession of the lines of depression as the mountain\r\nrange grew in height, and furnish a living example from which to\r\ndetermine the part that ice streams play in mountain sculpture.\r\n\r\n\r\n{192}\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL INSTRUCTIONS GOVERNING THE EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to make the records of the St. Elias expedition complete,\r\ncopies of the instructions under which the work was carried out are\r\nappended:\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,\r\n  UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, GEOLOGIC BRANCH,\r\n  _Washington, D.

It is expected that you will immediately aid him in\r\ndisbursement, and that you will act during the exploratory part of the\r\nexpedition as topographer. Your duties will, however, not be limited\r\nto these special functions, but you will be expected to perform any\r\nother duties he may assign to you, and to labor in every way for the\r\nsuccess of the expedition.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that you will be reappointed to the grade of\r\ntopographer on the United States Geological Survey on the 1st of July,\r\n1890, and you will please take the required oath of office before your\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThe money remaining in your possession as Disbursing Agent includes\r\nthat needed to meet Mr. Russell's salary and your own, and also the\r\nsum of $1,000, allotted from the funds of the Geographic Branch for\r\nexpenses of the expedition prior to June 30.

KERR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ascent of Mount St. Elias, it was part of the\r\noriginal plan of the expedition to make an accurate topographic map of\r\nthe region explored. It was not, however, for this purpose proposed to\r\ndivide the party or to deviate much from the most direct route to\r\nMount St. Elias from Yakutat bay. Triangulation of fair precision was\r\nprovided for. Details were to be filled in by approximate methods.\r\n\r\nField-work began June 20 by the careful measurement of a base-line,\r\n3,850 feet in length, near the point of landing, on the northern shore\r\nof Yakutat bay. Expansion was readily carried to the foot-hills, and\r\nseveral horizontal angles were taken to an astronomical station of the\r\nUnited States Coast and Geodetic Survey at Port Mulgrave. In the\r\nregion of these initial triangles, work was done from a central camp;\r\nand topographic details were fixed with considerable precision by\r\nintersection and vertical angles.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the expedition from the Base Line camp, an\r\naccident to the transit made resort to an inferior instrument\r\nnecessary, and, furthermore, as the region traversed proved to be\r\nill-adapted to, and the line of travel too direct for, the proper\r\ndevelopment of a narrow belt of triangles, the anticipation of a\r\ndegree of precision in the triangulation which would give high value\r\nto the determinations of position and altitude of the several peaks\r\nwas not realized; but topographic map work, showing the general\r\nfeatures, altitudes and location of the mountain ranges, valleys and\r\nglaciers, was extended over about 600 square miles.\r\n\r\nWithin the approximate geometric control, stations were interpolated\r\nby the three-point method, and minor locations were multiplied by\r\nintersection and connected by sketch. The best meander possible under\r\nthe circumstances was carried forward on the line of travel by compass\r\ndirections and estimates of distance from time intervals. The work\r\nceased August 22 with the abandonment of the instruments in a\r\nsnow-storm of four days' duration on the eastern slope of Mount St.\r\nElias.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying map (a reduction of which forms plate 8, page 75)\r\nshows the ice-streams and peculiar mountain topography of a region\r\nheretofore unvisited, and constitutes a considerable addition to the\r\ngeography of Alaska.\r\n\r\n\r\n{196}\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\nREPORT ON AURIFEROUS SANDS FROM YAKUTAT BAY.\r\n\r\nBY J. STANLEY-BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the specimens obtained by Mr. I. C. Russell during the course of\r\nhis explorations on and about Mount St. Elias is a bottle of sand\r\nprocured from the beach on the extreme southern end of Khantaak\r\nisland, Yakutat bay, and characteristic of the shore material over a\r\nlarge area. This sand was turned over to me for examination, and\r\nadditional interest was given to its study by the fact that it is from\r\na comparatively uninvestigated region and possesses, perhaps, economic\r\nvalue; for the sample is gold-bearing, and it is said that a \"color\"\r\ncan readily be obtained by \"panning\" at many points on the bay shore.\r\n\r\nMacroscopically, the sand has the appearance of ordinary finely\r\ncomminuted beach material; but it differs in the uniformity of the\r\nsize of its particles from beach sand from Fort Monroe and Sullivan\r\nisland, South Carolina, with which it was compared. Its mineralogic\r\nconstituents greatly surpass in variety those of the sands referred\r\nto, but are markedly similar to those of gold-bearing sand from New\r\nZealand. At least twelve minerals are present, with an unusual\r\npredominance of one, as will be noted later. Through the mixture of\r\nwhite, green, and black grains, a dull greenish-black color is given\r\nto the mass. The roundness of fragments is such as usually results\r\nfrom water action, but it is less than that which results from\r\ntransportation by wind.\r\n\r\nWhen put into a heavy liquid (Thoulet solution of a density of 3.1) in\r\norder to determine the specific gravity of the constituents, it was\r\nfound that the sand is made up largely of the heavier materials, for\r\nthe amount that floated was trifling compared with that which quickly\r\nsank. Even the abundant quartz was largely carried down by the\r\nweightier ingredients bound up within it, and only a few water-clear\r\nfragments were left behind. This would seem to suggest that the\r\nlighter minerals are lacking in the neighboring rocks, or else have\r\nbeen carried to greater distances by the sorting power of the water.\r\n\r\nAmong the minerals recognized, gold is the most important, though\r\nrelatively not abundant. It occurs in flakes or flattened grains from\r\na quarter to a half of a millimeter in size. The particles are\r\nsufficiently numerous to be readily selected from their associates by\r\nthe aid of \"panning\" and a hand lens of good magnifying power, and if\r\ndistributed throughout the beach as plentifully as in the sample\r\nwould, under favorable conditions, pay for working. The flakes in\r\ntheir rounded character show the effect of the agency which separated\r\nthem from their matrix; a separation so complete that no rock is found\r\nadhering to the grains.\r\n\r\n{197} Magnetite is present in great abundance and in a finely divided\r\nstate, the largest grains not exceeding a millimeter in length. It\r\nforms by weight alone 15 or 20 per cent. of the entire mass, and when\r\nthe latter is sifted through a sieve of a hundred meshes to the inch\r\nit constitutes 44 per cent. of this fine material. Crystallographic\r\nfaces are rare, and though often marred, still octahedrons (111, 1) of\r\nconsiderable perfection are found.\r\n\r\nGarnet occurs in such profusion that a pink tint is given to a mass of\r\nselected grains of uniform size, and its predominance may be\r\nconsidered the chief physical characteristic of the sand.\r\n\r\nTwo species were noted: one is a brilliant wine-red variety, which,\r\nthough not nearly so numerous as its duller relative, occurs more\r\nfrequently in crystals--the trapezohedral faces (211, 2-2)\r\npredominating. The other garnet is readily distinguished by its\r\nlighter amethystine tint and its greater abundance. Crystallographic\r\nfaces are somewhat rare and invariably dodecahedral (110, i). In the\r\nabsence of chemical analyses, any statements as to the exact species\r\nto which these garnets should be referred would be largely\r\nconjectural. Attention is quickly drawn to the perfection of these\r\nminute garnets in their crystallographic faces and outlines, and to\r\ntheir association with rounded fragments of their own kind as well as\r\nof other minerals. Have these crystals survived by reason of their\r\nhardness or by favoring conditions, or does their preservation suggest\r\nthe impotency of wave-action in the destruction of minute bodies?\r\n\r\nAmong the black, heavy grains occur individuals which, except in shape\r\nand non-magnetic character, resemble magnetite. On crushing between\r\nglass slides, thin slivers are obtained which in transmitted light are\r\ngreen, and which, from their cleavage, pleochroism, high index of\r\nrefraction, small extinction angle, and insolubility in acid, are\r\nreadily recognized as hornblende.\r\n\r\nTwo groups of grains were noted which are distinguishable by slight\r\nvariation in color. Both are clear-yellowish green, but one is\r\nsomewhat darker than the other. The optical properties of both\r\nindicate pyroxene and possibly olivine. Fortunately a fragment was\r\nobtained in the orthodiagonal zone nearly normal to an optic axis\r\nwhich gave an axial figure of sufficient definiteness to indicate its\r\noptically positive character. A number of grains were selected from\r\nminerals of both colors and subjected to prolonged heating in\r\nhydrochloric acid without decomposition, indicating that both minerals\r\nare pyroxene.\r\n\r\nA few zircons, a fraction of a millimeter in size but perfect in form,\r\nwere found associated with others rounded on their solid angles and\r\nedges. The crystals are of the common short form and bear the usual\r\nfaces in a greater or less degree of development. Pyramids of the\r\nfirst and second order alternate in magnitude; pinacoid encroaches\r\nupon prism, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nQuartz constitutes by far the largest proportion of the minerals, both\r\nin bulk and in weight. It is always fragmental; sometimes water-clear,\r\nbut chiefly occurs in opaque grains of different colors. It is seldom\r\nfree from material of a higher specific gravity, and is often so\r\ntinted as to be almost indistinguishable from magnetite, but readily\r\nbleaches in acid.\r\n\r\n{198} Feldspar is sparingly present, and includes both monoclinic and\r\ntriclinic forms, whose crystallographic boundaries are invariably\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\nTreatment of the sand with dilute acid produces effervescence, which\r\nis not due to incrustations of sodium carbonate. By persistent search\r\namong particles separated in a heavy solution, a few grains were\r\ndiscovered which, from their complete solubility with effervescence in\r\nvery dilute acid, as well as their optical properties, left no doubt\r\nas to their being calcite.\r\n\r\nThe mica group has only one representative, biotite, and this occurs\r\nmost sparingly. Though much of the sand was examined, but few\r\nfragments were found. Its foliated character renders it easily\r\ntransported by water and explains its absence from among the heavy\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nShaly, slaty and schistose material forms the major part of the\r\ncoarser grains. Thin sections from the largest pieces plainly\r\nindicated hornblende schist.\r\n\r\nA region of glaciers would seem to be favorable not only to the\r\ncollection of meteoric material, but also to the destruction of the\r\ncountry rocks, the setting free of their mineralogic constituents in a\r\ncomparatively fresh state, and their transportation to the sea. It was\r\nhoped that this sand would yield some of the rarer varieties of\r\nminerals, but tests for native iron, platinum, chromite, gneiss, and\r\nthe titaniferous minerals proved ineffectual. Titanium is present, but\r\nin such small quantities that it could only be detected by means of\r\nhydrogen peroxide. The use of acid supersulphate and the borotungstate\r\nof calcium test of Lasaulx failed to reveal the presence of native\r\niron.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing enumeration that the sand is made\r\nup of grains of gold, magnetite, garnet, hornblende, pyroxene, zircon,\r\nquartz, feldspar, calcite and mica, associated with fragments of a\r\nshaly, slaty and schistose character. While the information at hand is\r\nhardly sufficient to warrant much speculation concerning the rock\r\nmasses of the interior, still there is no doubt that the sand is\r\nderived from the destruction of metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n{199}\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\nREPORT ON FOSSIL PLANTS.\r\n\r\nBY LESTER F. WARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,\r\n  UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY,\r\n  _Washington, D. C., March 12, 1891_.\r\n\r\nMr. I. C. RUSSELL, _United States Geological Survey_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: The following report upon the small collection of fossil\r\nplants made by you at Pinnacle pass, near Mount St. Elias, Alaska, and\r\nsent to this division for identification has been prepared by\r\nProfessor F. H. Knowlton, who gave the collection a careful study\r\nduring my absence in Florida. Previous to going away I had somewhat\r\nhastily examined the specimens and seen that they consisted chiefly of\r\nthe genus _Salix_, some of them reminding me strongly of living\r\nspecies. I have no doubt that Professor Knowlton's more thorough\r\ncomparisons can be relied upon with as much confidence as the nature\r\nof the collection will permit, and I also agree with his conclusions.\r\n\r\n\"The collection consists of seven small hand specimens, upon which are\r\nimpressed no less than seventeen more or less completely preserved\r\ndicotyledonous leaves.\r\n\r\n\"These specimens at first sight seem to represent six or eight\r\nspecies, but after a careful study I think I am safe in reducing the\r\nnumber to four, as several of the impressions have been nearly\r\nobliterated by prolonged exposure and cannot be studied with much\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"The four determinable species belong, without much doubt, to the\r\ngenus _Salix_. Number 1, of which there is but a single specimen, I\r\nhave identified with _Salix californica_, Lesquereux, from the\r\nauriferous gravel deposits of the Sierra Nevada in California.[38] The\r\nfiner nervation of the specimens from the auriferous gravels is not\r\nclearly shown in Lesquereux's figures, nor is it well preserved in the\r\nMount St. Elias specimens; but the size, outline, and primary\r\nnervation are identical.\r\n\r\n\"Number 2, of which there are six or eight specimens, may be compared\r\nwith _Salix raeana_, Heer,[39] a species that was first described from\r\nGreenland and was later detected by Lesquereux in a collection from\r\nCooks inlet, Alaska.[40] The Mount St. Elias specimens are not very\r\nmuch like the original figures of Heer, but are very similar, in\r\noutline at least, to this species as figured by Lesquereux.[41] They\r\nare also very similar to {200} some forms of the living _S. rostrata_,\r\nRichardson, with entire leaves. It is clearly a willow, but closer\r\nidentification must remain for more complete material.\r\n\r\n\"Number 3, represented by four or five specimens, is broadly\r\nelliptical in outline, and is also clearly a _Salix_. It is unlike any\r\nfossil form with which I am familiar, but is very similar to the\r\nliving _S. nigricans_, For., var. _rotundifolia_, and to certain forms\r\nof _S. silesiaca_, Willd. The nervation is very distinctly preserved,\r\nand has all the characters of a willow leaf.\r\n\r\n\"Number 4, represented by three or four very fine specimens, is a very\r\nlarge leaf, measuring 13 cm. in length and 3½ cm. in width at the\r\nbroadest point. It may be compared with _Salix macrophylla_, Heer,[42]\r\nbut it cannot be this species. It is also like some of the living\r\nforms of _S. nigra_, Marsh., from which it differs in having perfectly\r\nentire margins.\r\n\r\n\"While it is manifestly impossible, on the basis of the above\r\nidentifications, to speak with confidence as to the age or formation\r\ncontaining these leaves, it can hardly be older than the Miocene, and\r\nfrom its strong resemblance to the present existing flora of Alaska it\r\nis likely to be much younger.\" [F. H. Knowlton.]\r\n\r\n  Very sincerely yours,\r\n    LESTER F. WARD.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Mem. Mus. Comp. Zool., vol. VI, no. 2, 1878, p. 10, pl.\r\ni, figs. 18-21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Flor. foss.
