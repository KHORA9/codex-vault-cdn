The\r\ncomprehensive journals and reports of the venerable Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Expedition, Commodore Wullerstorff-Urbair, as well as the various\r\nmemoranda of the other members of the Scientific Commission, contributed\r\nmaterially to the elucidation of my own general notes, as well as my\r\nobservations upon special subjects, which latter chiefly referred to the\r\nGeography, Ethnography, and general Statistics of the various countries\r\nvisited.\r\n\r\nWhile preparing the details of our voyage for publication in my own\r\nlanguage, the idea perpetually presented itself that a translation of this\r\nnarrative into English might prove not unacceptable to the British public.\r\nAnd although fully aware that a voyage round the globe, in the course of\r\nwhich little more than the coasts were visited of the various countries we\r\ntouched at, could not pretend to offer much new information to the\r\ngreatest of maritime nations, it seemed, nevertheless, that it might\r\ninterest a people so eager in the pursuit of knowledge as the English, to\r\nknow the impression which has been made upon travellers of education by\r\nthe Colonies and Settlements of Britain throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe English language, moreover, being spoken more or less over the greater\r\npart of the earth's surface, geographically speaking, the author who\r\naddresses his readers in that tongue is sustained by the flattering\r\nconviction that he will be understood by the majority of the nations of\r\nthe globe! For it is not alone the educated classes of all countries that\r\nseek to master a language which possesses such a grand--all but unrivalled\r\nliterature! The political and commercial development which Great Britain\r\nenjoys under the benign influence of liberal institutions, has made\r\nEnglish the medium of intercourse among almost all sea-faring nations;\r\nnay, even barbarous tribes find it their obvious interest to get a slight\r\ninkling at least of the language of a people whose civilizing and\r\nelevating energies they may not, it is true, understand, far less\r\nappreciate, but whose imposing power inspires them with awe, while they\r\nare more closely attached by the tie of material advantage.\r\n\r\nThe following narrative describes the most important occurrences and most\r\nlasting impressions of a voyage during which we traversed 51,686 miles,\r\nvisited twenty-five different places, and spent 551 days at sea, and 298\r\nat anchor or on shore.\r\n\r\nAs the purely scientific results of the Expedition will be published\r\nseparately under the supervision of Commodore Wullerstorf and the other\r\nmembers of the scientific corps, I shall, in this place, only attempt to\r\nplace before the reader a general outline of the countries and races\r\nvisited during our cruise in different regions of the world.\r\n\r\nIn relating simply and concisely what was seen and experienced, I have\r\nendeavoured to avoid incurring the reproach, so frequently launched by\r\nEnglish critics against German works of travel, of dryness and minute\r\ndetail, such as render them distasteful to the English reader, and make it\r\nalmost impossible to enlist his attention or evoke his sympathy.\r\n\r\nIf, as is specially the case with respect to natural science, many a\r\ndoubtful point still remains undecided--if the ingenious \"Suggestions\" of\r\nthe immortal Alexander von Humboldt (for the translation of which I feel\r\nparticularly indebted to that profound scholar, my learned and esteemed\r\nfriend Mr. Haidinger, whose name will be familiar to the scientific world\r\nin Great Britain), could not be acted upon to the extent and in the\r\neffectual manner each of us could have wished, the reason for such\r\ndeficiencies will be found in the peculiar mission of the Expedition, and\r\nin the arrangement of our route, which was specially laid out with\r\nreference to the numerous and widely different objects, which it was\r\nspecially intended to keep in view throughout the voyage.\r\n\r\nAmong the more prominent of these, may be specified the opportunity thus\r\nafforded for the practical instruction of our young and rapidly-increasing\r\nnavy; the unfurling of the Imperial flag of Austria in those distant\r\nclimes, where it had never before floated; the promulgation of commercial\r\ntreaties; the aid afforded to science in exploration and investigation, as\r\nwell as by the collection of those objects of Natural History, the\r\nacquisition of which is all but impossible to the solitary naturalist,\r\nowing to the expense and difficulty of transport,[1] and the establishment\r\neverywhere of friendly correspondence between our own scientific\r\ninstitutions and those in remote regions, I have considered it necessary\r\nto invite the attention of the British reading public to these\r\ncircumstances, in order to make them more intimately cognisant of our\r\nvarious and manifold tasks, and thus make them the more readily disposed\r\nto overlook the deficiencies and discrepancies of this book, which I now\r\nrespectfully commit to their perusal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Notwithstanding the short period at our disposal at each\r\nport, which concomitant necessity militates so much against the practical\r\nutility of a circumnavigation of the globe as compared with an expedition\r\nsolely directed to one single centre of scientific observation, the\r\ncollection of objects of Natural History made during the cruise are very\r\nextensive, and unusually rich in new or rare species. The zoological\r\ndepartment alone embraces above 23,700 individuals of different kinds of\r\nanimals: viz. 440 mammalia, 300 reptiles, 1500 birds, 1400 _Amphibiæ_,\r\n1330 fish, 9000 insects, 8900 Molluscs and _Crustaceæ_, 300 birds' eggs\r\nand nests, besides numerous skeletons. The botanical collection consists\r\nof _Herbaria_, seeds of useful plants, special regard being had to those\r\nbest adapted for the various climates of the respective Austrian\r\nprovinces, drugs, specimens of dye-woods, and timber, fruits preserved in\r\nalcohol, &c. The Geological and Palæontological Museums of our country\r\nhave likewise been enriched with various rare and valuable specimens,\r\nparticularly in consequence of Dr. Hochstetter, the geologist of the\r\nExpedition, having prolonged his stay in New Zealand, where, at the\r\nspecial request of the Colonial Government, he explored the province of\r\nAuckland. The Ethnographical and Anthropological collection consists of\r\nabove 550 objects, among which are 100 skulls, representing the craniology\r\nof almost all the races of the globe.]\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, I beg leave to express my hearty thanks to all those\r\nwho have contributed in such various ways to aid my humble efforts--to\r\nspecify some were invidious, as in so doing I must wrong others. To each\r\nand all I return the most heartfelt gratitude.\r\n\r\nMay the indulgent reader peruse the following pages with an approving\r\neye--may they afford him as much satisfaction and as much interest as I\r\nexperienced in committing to paper the descriptions and impressions\r\ntherein set forth, since in so doing, I, so to speak, made the delightful\r\nvoyage for the second time, and in thought visited once more the different\r\nlocalities, from every one of which I, and my fellow-travellers, brought\r\naway none but the most friendly and agreeable recollections.\r\n\r\nIt inspires a _German_ traveller with a peculiar and lofty feeling of\r\npride and delight that he can look upon himself as belonging to a race, to\r\nwhom seems to have been reserved the diffusion of a New Life over the\r\nearth--whose special mission it appears to be to make even the most\r\nprimitive tribes in the remotest corner of the world acquainted with the\r\nblessings of Christian civilization, of political liberty, of intellectual\r\nculture, and, standing triumphant on the ruins of slavery and despotism,\r\nto proclaim to the great family of universal mankind, the advent of a new,\r\na vernal era of Faith, Freedom, and Happiness!\r\n\r\n                                           DR.

Arago, for the guidance of the\r\nFrench expeditions, or for Lord Minto, then First Lord of the Admiralty,\r\non the occasion of the Antarctic Voyage of Discovery of Sir James Ross\r\n(1840-43). The following pages consist simply of hints which may possibly\r\nprove serviceable to the distinguished and highly informed gentlemen, who\r\nhave the good fortune to sail on board the Imperial Frigate, _Novara_,\r\nunder the command of Commodore von Wüllerstorf. With two of these savans,\r\nDr. Ferdinand Hochstetter and Dr. Karl Scherzer, I have had the pleasure,\r\nhere in Berlin, to agree verbally on various subjects.\r\n\r\nAs I do not exactly know what course it is intended the _Novara_ shall\r\nfollow in navigating the Atlantic, nor in what meridian it is proposed to\r\ncross the Equator, (in conformity with the sound and useful directions of\r\nmy friend Lieut. Maury, of Washington), on her voyage to Rio de Janeiro,\r\nnor how near she shall keep to Cape San Roque and Fernando de Noronha, I\r\nmust content myself with inviting the attention of the voyagers in a\r\ngeneral way to the temperature of the sea, as also to the variations and\r\naberrations of the magnetic curves, and their currents.\r\n\r\nA lower degree of temperature is usually observed W. of the Canaries, and\r\nCape Verde Islands, commencing with the Salvages, the thermometer\r\nindicating as low as 72°·7 Fahr. This has been already ascertained by Mr.\r\nCharles Deville, in his chart of temperature on the voyage \"aux Antilles,\r\nà Ténériffe et à Fogo.\" I consider this diminution of temperature results\r\nfrom the North Guinea current, bringing with it cold water from the north\r\nsouthwards as far as the Bight of Biafra and the River Gaboon, at which\r\npoint it is encountered by an opposite current flowing northwards along\r\nthe south-western coast of Africa from Loando and Congo.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, Captain Duperrey had accurately laid down the point of\r\nintersection of the magnetic, with the terrestrial equator. In 1837, we\r\nlearned from Sabine's investigations of magnetic inclination near the\r\nIsland of St. Thomas (on the Equator, adjoining the above portion of the\r\ncoast of Africa), that this point of intersection had already shifted\r\nfour degrees to the westward. A period of twenty years having elapsed\r\nsince Sabine's expedition for determining observations with the pendulum,\r\nit would be most desirable that fresh investigations should be made in\r\nthat neighbourhood, for the purpose of verifying the secular changes of\r\nall magnetic curves, especially with regard to their variation. In 1840,\r\nthe line of no declination in America began 9° 30' E. of South Georgia,\r\nwhence it ran to the S.E. coast of Brazil, near Cape Frio, thus traversing\r\nthe mainland of South America only between the latter point and the\r\nparallel of 0° 36' S., when it leaves the continent a little to the east\r\nof Gran Parà, near Cape Tigioca, cutting the terrestrial equator again,\r\nbut in 50° 6' W. According to Bache's Map of Equal Magnetic Declination,\r\nit reaches the coast of North America near Cape Fear, to the south-west of\r\nCape Lookout. This line, along which the magnetic declination is _nil_,\r\nextends to a point in Lake Erie, 2° 40' W. of Toronto, where the\r\ndeclination is already 1° 27' W.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Wherever, in this paper, it is not precisely expressed to the\r\ncontrary, the scale of the Centigrade Thermometer, the longitude from the\r\nMeridian of Paris, the French foot (_pied du roi_=12·79 inches English),\r\nand the geographical mile, 15 to a degree of the Equator, measuring 3807\r\n\"toises,\" are meant.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the observations of Captains Beechey and Findley, and\r\nstill more particularly from those of the French Captain Kerhallet, that\r\nthe remarkable subdivision of the main equinoctial current, flowing from\r\neast to west into two branches, one directed to the N.W., the other to the\r\nS.S.W., commences at a considerable distance from the Capes of St. Roque\r\nand St. Augustin. This bifurcation has always, and with good reason, been\r\nascribed to the protruding convexity of the South American continent at\r\nthese two promontories. It would be an important step gained in verifying\r\nthe theory of currents, could the precise distance be ascertained by\r\nchronometer. It is apparently like an \"_actio in distans_,\" probably a\r\nphenomenon of what is known as \"packing.\" As the frigate, on leaving Rio\r\nde Janeiro is to make for the Cape of Good Hope, the opportunity will\r\npresent, should she steer sufficiently southerly, for many interesting\r\nobservations with respect to the _connecting current_ W.N.W. and E.S.E.\r\nwhich encounters that from Madagascar and Mozambique, close to the Cape,\r\nmore especially with regard to the temperature of the sea.\r\n\r\nIf the frigate is intended to approach the small cluster of islands of\r\nFernando de Noronha, E. of Pernambuco (Lat. 3° 50' S.), I would recommend\r\nto that excellent geognostic, Dr. Hochstetter, the hornblendic phonolithe\r\nrock found there, far from a volcanic crater, but with trachytic dykes and\r\nbasaltic amygdaloid. The flat little island of St. Paul (Peñedo de San\r\nPedro), 1° N. Lat., singular to say, is not volcanic at all, containing,\r\nlike the Malouin or Falkland Islands, slaty green-stone passing into\r\nserpentine.\r\n\r\nShould the frigate alter her course and cross the Equator more to the\r\neastward, without touching at Rio de Janeiro, she might possibly fall in\r\nwith the Marine Volcanic region, (Lat. 0° 20' S., Long. 22° W.), which\r\nhas quite lately become famous again by the U. S. Expedition of the Brig\r\n_Dolphin_ (1854), commanded by Lieutenant Lee. On 19th May, 1806, columns\r\nof black smoke were seen issuing from the sea by Krusenstern, and volcanic\r\nashes were gathered, after a singular bubbling of the sea from 1748 to\r\n1836, according to careful investigations by Daussy.\r\n\r\nAs the frigate is commissioned to visit Ceylon and the Nicobar Islands,\r\nshe cannot sail direct from the Cape to Australia; and the hope must\r\ntherefore be abandoned of her visiting the small basaltic islands, known\r\nas Prince Edward's (47° 2' S., 38° E.), and Possession (46° 28' S., 47°\r\n30' E.), belonging to the Crozet's Group, or the two islands, long\r\nconfounded with each other, of Amsterdam (Lat. 37° 48' S.) and St. Paul\r\n(Lat. 38° 38' S.) The latter island, the more southerly of the two, (a\r\nvery characteristic drawing of which was given by Willem de Vlaming so far\r\nback as 1696), is supposed to be volcanic, not only by its form, which\r\nwill at once remind the geologist of Santorin, Barren Island, and\r\nDeception Island, (one of the New Shetland group), but also in consequence\r\nof the eruption of steam, and the flames occasionally observed there.\r\n\r\nAs for Amsterdam, which consists of a single densely-wooded mountain, the\r\npuzzle remains for solution as to how, during the expedition of\r\nD'Entrecasteaux in 1792, the whole island seemed, during two entire days,\r\nenveloped in smoke; whereas, on landing there, the naturalists of that\r\nexpedition were satisfied that the mountain was not an active volcano,\r\nand that the columns of steam issued out of the ground near the shore! As\r\nyet, the phenomenon remains entirely unexplained.\r\n\r\nIf we examine any map of the Indian Ocean, we may trace the continuation\r\nof the Sunda group from Sumatra, N.W., through the Nicobar, and Great and\r\nLittle Andaman Islands, and thence through the volcanoes of Barren Island,\r\nNarcondam and Cheduba, nearly parallel with the coasts of Malacca and\r\nTenasserim, all on the eastern part of the Bay of Bengal. The minor\r\nvolcanoes just enumerated will present valuable opportunities of\r\ngeological enquiry.\r\n\r\nAlong the coasts of Orissa and Coromandel, the western portion of the Bay\r\nof Bengal is quite free of islands, Ceylon, like Madagascar presenting\r\nrather the type of a continent.\r\n\r\nOff the W. coast of the peninsula of India, (that is opposite the\r\nNeilgherrie hills, and the coast of Canara and Malabar), there is a series\r\nof three archipelagoes, extending from 14° N. to 8° S., viz., the\r\nLaccadives, the Maldives, and the Chagos, which appears, as it were,\r\ncontinued through the banks of Sahia di Malha, and Cargados Carajos, to\r\nthe volcanic group of the Mascarenhas and Madagascar. As the first-named\r\narchipelagoes, so far as is yet known, consist solely of coral, and are,\r\nconsequently, true \"atolls,\" or reef-lagoons, the bottom of the ocean\r\nshould be examined over a large extent, adopting the ingenious hypothesis\r\nof Darwin, that it is to be considered _as an area of subsidence_, rather\r\nthan an elevated region.\r\n\r\nIt would also be a matter of great importance to get observations\r\nrespecting terrestrial magnetism, particularly so as to define the\r\nposition of a given segment of the magnetic equator. Capt. Elliott, as the\r\nresult of his comprehensive studies, (1846-49), ascertained that the\r\nmagnetic equator passes through the north end of Borneo, and thence nearly\r\ndue W. to the northern extremity of Ceylon. In this region the curve of\r\nminimum intensity is nearly parallel to the magnetic equator, which\r\nintersects the Continent of Africa near Cape Guardafui--according to\r\nRochet d'Héricourt, in lat. 10° 7' N., long. 38° 5'. E. Between this point\r\nand the Bight of Biafra nothing is known.\r\n\r\nThe South Asiatic islands comprise Formosa, the Philippines, the Sunda\r\ngroup, and the Moluccas. The great and little Sunda Islands and the\r\nMoluccas embrace 109 volcanoes, with fiery eruptions, and 10 what are\r\ncalled mud-volcanoes. This is not a mere estimate, but is the result of an\r\nenumeration by Junghuhn, who, within the last year (1856), has returned to\r\nJava, and thoroughly equipped by M. Pahud, Governor-General of the Indian\r\nNetherlands, will be of great assistance to the Imperial Expedition.\r\n\r\nAn exact mineralogical determination of the volcanic rocks (trachytes) is\r\nunfortunately wanting everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe most active volcano of Sumatra is the Gunung Merapi (8980 feet), which\r\nmust not be confounded with a volcano in Java, of the same name. That of\r\nSumatra was ascended by Dr. L. Horner, and Dr. Korthals in 1834. We may\r\npronounce Indrapura (11,500 feet, but this measurement is very uncertain),\r\nand Gunung Pasoman (9010 feet), the Ophir of our maps, to be utterly\r\nunknown geologically. The highest of the Java volcanoes is Gunung Semeru\r\n(11,480 feet), ascended by Junghuhn in 1844, 1220 feet higher than the\r\nEtna. The largest craters of the 45 which are disposed in a line along the\r\nshores of Java, are Gunung Tengger, and Gunung Raou. Dr. Junghuhn has\r\nrecently given the outlines of each separate volcano in his splendid\r\ntopographical and geological map of Java, in four sheets, published in\r\n1856, which does great credit to the Dutch Government.\r\n\r\nThe following subjects are worthy of special attention while the frigate\r\nis at Java.\r\n\r\n1. The curious phenomenon of the ribbed surface. (_Vide_ Junghuhn, Java,\r\nPart II., p. 608.)\r\n\r\n2. The disposition, as yet unaccounted for, of a series of\r\nregularly-shaped hills, formed by the mud-streams ejected in the year 1822\r\nby the volcano of Gunung Galungung. (_Vide ut suprà_, pp. 127-731.)\r\n\r\n3. The ejection of water by the Gunung Idjen, on 21st January, 1817, (pp.\r\n707, and 717-121).\r\n\r\n4. The erroneousness of the assertion that the volcanoes of the Island of\r\nJava do not emit streams of real lava.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the mighty Javanese volcano, Gunung Merapi,\r\nalready alluded to, has not, within the historic period, presented any\r\ncoherent compact streams of lava, but mere fragments and boulders;\r\nalthough in 1837, lines of fire were seen running uninterruptedly from\r\nthe top down the sides of the cones in eruption. But each of the three\r\nvolcanoes, Tengger, Idjen, and Slamat, present examples of black lava\r\ncurrents, descending as far as the tertiary strata.\r\n\r\nStreams of stone-boulders, red-hot, similar to those of the Cotopaxi, but\r\nscarcely touching each other, flowed from Gunung Lamorgan on 6th July,\r\n1838.\r\n\r\nNo active volcano is known in the island of Borneo. The highest mountain\r\nof the whole island, perhaps of the whole insular world of Southern Asia,\r\nis the Hina Baïlu (12,850 feet?) on the northern point of Borneo. It is as\r\nyet unexplored. According to Dr. Lewis Horner, son of the astronomer of\r\nthe Krusenstern expedition, there occur among the syenite and serpentine\r\nmountain range of Rathus, on the S.E. of the island, deposits yielding\r\ngold (which has even been worked by diggings), diamonds, platinum,\r\niridium, and osmium,--presenting, in fact, a similar association to those\r\nof the Ural mountains. No mention is made of palladium. Rajah (now Sir\r\nJames) Brooke describes in the province of Sarawak in Borneo, a low hill,\r\nGunung Api (\"hill of fire\" in Malay), the slags of which attest former\r\nvolcanic activity. A visit to Borneo would be of very great service.\r\n\r\nThere are eleven volcanoes in Celebes, and six in Flores, all active.\r\n\r\nIt is still uncertain whether the conical mountain Wawari, or Atiti,\r\nwhich is more generally known as the volcano of the island of Amboyna,\r\never poured out anything except hot mud (1674), or whether it should be\r\nmerely classed as a _solfatara_. The main group of the South Asiatic\r\nIslands is connected through the Moluccas and the Philippines with the\r\nPapua and Pellew islands, and the Caroline Archipelago of the South Sea.\r\n\r\nThe most important geological fact to be remarked with reference to the\r\nisland of Formosa, abounding in mineral coals, is the break in the line of\r\ndirection of the open vents, when, instead of N.E. to S.W., the central\r\nline follows the meridian line, which it pursues nearly as far as 6° S.,\r\npassing through Formosa and the Philippine Islands (Luzon and Mindanao),\r\nrespecting which deviation nothing certain is known, and in which region\r\nevery mountain of conical shape, or outline is invariably set down as a\r\nvolcano, even though there should be no indications of a crater. The\r\nSooloo Archipelago forms the connecting link between the islands of Borneo\r\nand Mindanao, the long, narrow island of Palawan, constituting that\r\nbetween Borneo and Mindoro.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Yesso, separated from that of Niphon by the Straits of\r\nSangar, or Tsugar, and from the islands of Krafto (Saghalien) and Tschoka,\r\nor Tarakai, by the Straits of La Pérouse, connects, through its North\r\nEastern Cape, with the archipelago of the Kuriles. From Broughton's\r\nSouthern Vulcan Bay up to its northernmost point, Yesso is traversed by an\r\nuninterrupted range of volcanoes--a fact the more worthy of being\r\nrecorded, as in the expedition of La Pérouse there were found red porous\r\nlavas, as well as wide areas, covered with slags, in the Baie des\r\nCastries, in the narrow island of Krafto (Saghalien), which is, as it\r\nwere, merely a continuation of Yesso. In our own day these regions command\r\na higher interest, from a political point of view, more especially since\r\nRussia, dissatisfied with the situation of Okhotsk, at the sanded mouth of\r\nthe Amoor, was anxious, after the destruction of Petropaulowski, on the\r\ncoast of Kamtschatka, to obtain, on the S.E. coast, a harbour suitable\r\nfor a military station.\r\n\r\nAmong the three islands which form the main portion of the Japanese\r\nEmpire, six volcanoes are known to have had eruptions in the historic\r\nperiod. The volcano, Fusi Jama, in Niphon, province of Suruga (Lat. 35°\r\n18' N., Long. 136° 15' E., altitude 11,675 feet), is said to have risen\r\nout of the plain 286 years before the Christian era. Its last eruption was\r\nin 1707. The volcano, Asama Jama, in the district of Saku, between the\r\nmeridians of the two capitals, Miaco and Jeddo, was last in eruption in\r\n1783. On the island of Kiusiu, adjoining the peninsula of Corea, four\r\nvolcanoes are situated, from one of which, called Wanzen, there was a most\r\ndestructive eruption in 1793.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful work of Commodore Perry, U.S.N., detailing his mission to\r\nJapan, on the part of the United States Government, in 1852, containing\r\nexcellent photographs of races, as also drawings by the Berlin artist,\r\nWilhelm Heine, does not, as yet, comprise the scientific results of that\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nProceeding northwards, the volcanoes are more densely crowded, and are\r\nfound arranged in series. Of the fifty-four which I enumerated as still in\r\nactivity among the islands of Eastern Asia, there are thirty-four on the\r\nAleutian, and ten on the Kurile Islands. The Peninsula of Kamtschatka\r\ncontains nine volcanoes, which have been in activity within the historic\r\nperiod. Lying under the 54th and 60th degrees of northern latitude, we see\r\na long strip of sea-bottom between two continents undergoing a perpetual\r\nprocess of destruction and re-arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe South Sea, the superficial extent of which is one-sixth greater than\r\nthat of the entire solid crust of our planet, actually presents a smaller\r\nnumber of active volcanoes, less vents for communication between the\r\ncentre of the earth and its atmospheric envelope, than the single Island\r\nof Java! Out of 40 volcanic cones, including those which are extinct, only\r\n26 have been seen in eruption during the historic period. They are not\r\nscattered at random, but, on the contrary, as was pointed out by Mr. James\r\nDana, the ingenious geologist of the great United States Exploring\r\nExpedition, under the command of Capt. Wilkes (1838-42), they have been\r\nthrown up, at widely extending clefts, communicating by submarine mountain\r\nsystems. They are arranged in groups and distinct regions, analogous to\r\nthe mountain chains of Central Asia and Armenia (in the district of the\r\nCaucasus), and belong to two quite distinct systems, one running S.E. to\r\nN.W., the other S.S.W. to N.N.E.\r\n\r\nIn the Hawaiian Archipelago (or Sandwich Island group), we find Mauna Loa,\r\naccording to Wilkes, 12,900 feet in height, which does not present any\r\ncone of volcanic scoriæ (resembling, in this particular, the volcanoes of\r\nthe Eifel), but has emitted streams of lava. The lava basin of Killauea,\r\n13,000 feet in its greatest, by 4800 in its smallest diameter, is not a\r\n_solfatara_, but a true lateral vent on the flank of the powerful Mauna\r\nLoa itself, exactly resembling the less elevated sheet of lava of Arak.\r\nMauna Kea is 180 feet higher than Mauna Loa, but is extinct. Tafoa and\r\nAmangura, in the Tonga group, are still in eruption, the last discharge of\r\nlava having occurred in July, 1847. The volcano of Tanna was in full\r\neruption during Capt. Cook's Voyage of Discovery in 1774, as was also the\r\nvolcano of Ambrym, west of Malicollo in the archipelago of the New\r\nHebrides. At the south point of New Caledonia, lies Matthew's Rock, a\r\nsmall smoking rocky island. The volcano of Santa Cruz, N.N.W. of Tina\r\nKora, with periodical eruptions occasionally occurring at intervals of 10\r\nminutes, had been already noticed as a volcano by Mendana, so far back as\r\n1595. In the Salomon Archipelago, there is found the volcano of Sesarga,\r\nwhile others are said to be in full activity in the Marianas or Ladrones,\r\njust like those of Guguan, Pagon, and El Volcan Grande de Asuncion, which\r\nappear to have broken forth along a line that follows the meridian. In New\r\nBritannia, three conical mountains were observed vomiting streams of lava,\r\nby Tasman, Carteret, and Labillardière. There are two volcanoes in full\r\nactivity on the north-east coast of New Guinea, opposite Admiralty\r\nIslands, which themselves are so rich in obsidian. In New Zealand,\r\nnumerous regions abound in basaltic and trachytic rocks. Of active\r\nvolcanoes there are Puhia-i-Wakati (the volcano of White Island), and the\r\nlofty cone of Tongariro (5816 feet). To the absence of centres of volcanic\r\nagency in New Caledonia, where sedimentary formations and seams of coal\r\nhave recently been discovered, is ascribed the vast development of coral\r\nreefs. Dana was the first to ascend the Peak of Tafua, in the Island of\r\nUpolu, one of the Samoa group, not to be confounded with the still active\r\nvolcano of Tafoa, south of Amangura, in the Tonga Archipelago. Dana found\r\nin it a crater overgrown with thick forest. So, too, on the isolated Vaihu\r\nor Easter Island group, there is found a range of conical mountains with\r\ncraters, but inactive.\r\n\r\nOf the volcanic groups of the South Sea, the most violent is the farthest\r\neast, adjoining the shores of the New World, viz., the archipelago of the\r\nGallipagos, which consists of five considerable islands, very admirably\r\ndescribed by Darwin. There are streams of lava down to the very shore of\r\nthe sea, but no pumice. Some of the trachytic lavas are said to abound\r\nwith crystals of albite. It is important to examine whether or not this\r\nis oligoclase, as on Teneriffe, Popocatepetl, and Chimborazo; or\r\nlabradorite, as on Etna and Stromboli. Palagonite, exactly similar to that\r\nof Iceland or in Italy, was discovered by Bunsen in the specimens of tufa\r\nfrom Chatham Island, one of the Gallipagos.\r\n\r\nNew Holland does not show any signs of recent volcanic activity, except at\r\nits most southern point (Australia Felix), at the foot of the Grampian\r\nMountains. N.W. from Port Philip, as also towards the Murray River, there\r\nare numbers of volcanic cones and sheets or flows of lava.\r\n\r\nIt would be of great interest and utility to observe the relative\r\ninclinations of the Magnetic and the Geographical Equators, by means of\r\nthe dip of the magnetic needle, though this will be rendered more\r\ndifficult, from the fact of the ship's course being easterly, that is,\r\ncontrary, to the Equinoctial current. As regards the low temperature of\r\nthe current, which I discovered in 1802, running up from 40° S. to the\r\nGallipagos along the coast of South America, and then turning westward, it\r\nwould be highly important to investigate whether in the eastern part of\r\nthe South Sea in 7° N. and between 117° and 140° W., there really exists\r\nin every season a _counter current_ from west to east. But I need not\r\nenlarge upon this topic to such attentive navigators.\r\n\r\nThe line of no inclination was crossed six times by Duperrey between 1822\r\nand 1825. When I first discovered, near Truxillo, the low temperature of\r\nthe cold Peruvian current, it was 12°·8 Réaumur (60°·8 Fahr.). The\r\ntemperature observed in the course of twenty years by Mr. Dirckinck von\r\nHolmfeld, in the neighbourhood of Callao, expressed in degrees of Réaumur,\r\nwere as follows:--\r\n\r\n September  1802     12°·8  (Fahr. 60°·8)  }  Thermometer in the air.\r\n November    \"       12°·4  (  \"   59°·9)  }  13°·3 Réaumur.\r\n December,  end of   16°·8  (  \"   69°·8)  }  (61°·92 Fahr.)\r\n January    1825     12°·7  (  \"   60°·57)\r\n February    \"       15°·3  (  \"   66°·42)\r\n March       \"       15°·7  (  \"   67°·32)\r\n April       \"       14°·5  (  \"   64°·62)\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the sea I found to be 22° Réaumur (81°·5 Fah.) north of\r\nCape Blanco, when on my way from Callao de Lima, at which point the cold\r\ncurrent diverged towards the Gallipagos.\r\n\r\nBetween the Gulfs of Guayaquil and Panama, north-east of the cold current,\r\nthe temperature of the sea during the month of April rose as high as\r\n24°·5, (87°·12 Fahr.). Within the range of the current, Mr. Dirckinck had\r\ncarried on his observations in compliance with my instructions, by means\r\nof thermometers that had been compared by Arago. Everywhere in the\r\ncurrent, in December 1824, he found from 16° to 18° (68° to 72°·5 Fahr.);\r\nbetween Quilca and Callao, in January, 1825, from 18° to 19° (72°·5 to\r\n74°·75 Fahr.); between Chorillos, near Lima (Lat. 12° 39' S.) and\r\nValparaiso, in August, 1825, from 13°·8 to 10°·5 (63°·05 to 55°·62 Fahr.);\r\nbetween Chorillos and San Carlos de Chiloe, in June, 1825, from 18°·8 to\r\n9°·2 (74°·3 to 52°·7).\r\n\r\nIn sailing from the Sandwich Islands to the west coast of America, the\r\nImperial Expedition will have to choose between the Ports of San Francisco\r\nor Acapulco. The first choice would be of great mineralogical advantage\r\nfor those regions of the United States, lying North of the river Gila.[3]\r\nParallel with the chain of the Rocky Mountains, which, according to\r\nMarcou, contains up to the present day several volcanoes in full activity\r\nin its northern part (Lat. 46° 12' N.), run single, and at certain points\r\ndouble ranges of coast chains from San Diego to Monterey, from 32° 15' N.\r\nto 46° 45' N. They begin with the coast range specially so-called, which\r\nis a continuation of the high ridge of the Peninsula of Lower or Old\r\nCalifornia; after which, farther to the North, there follow in succession,\r\nfirst the Sierra Nevada di Alta California, between 36° and 38° N. the\r\nlofty Shasty mountains, and the Cascade Range, nearly twenty six miles\r\ndistant from the littoral, including many high and active volcanoes, and\r\nextending far beyond Fuca Straits. The following are still in\r\neruption:--Mount St. Elias (46° 2' N.); Mount Regnier, or Rainier, (46°\r\n46'); and Mount Baker, (48° 48'.) These three active cones would be most\r\nconveniently visited by the geologist of the expedition from San\r\nFrancisco, as would likewise the whole Cascade Range. We have as yet no\r\ncertain intelligence as to the geology of the entire longitudinal\r\nauriferous valley of the Sacramento River, (where a trachytic crater, in\r\na state of disintegration, is known as the Butt of Sacramento). Does the\r\nauriferous quartz occur in veins, and are these still _in situ_, or are\r\nthey broken up? What description of rock is traversed by these veins? Does\r\nthe wash-gold here contain occasionally, as in the Ural Mountains,\r\nfragments of vein-stones with isolated cavities, in which are found\r\nimpressions of leaves and membranes, clearly proving that they have not\r\nbeen rolled, or transported by water, any great distance to the spot they\r\nnow occupy? Have these been found, alongside of gold, diamonds, platinum,\r\nosmium, iridium, or mercury?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Gila falls into the Colorado about forty miles above the\r\nembouchure of the latter into the head of the Gulf of California.]\r\n\r\nShould the frigate steer for Acapulco, it may be assumed that there exists\r\nan intention to cross the Continent to Mexico and Vera Cruz, from the\r\nvolcano of Colima (1877 toises) as it were, along the parallel of the\r\nrange of volcanoes, and greatest heights rising in detached groups between\r\nthe two seas, about the parallel of 19° N. New astronomical observations\r\nare greatly needed for determining the position of the volcanoes of Colima\r\nand Jorullo (667 toises). The volcano of Colima, with its twin peaks _de\r\nfuego_ and _de nieve_, should be carefully examined, as also the volcano\r\nof Jorullo, with the fragments of granite enclosed in its lava; the Nevado\r\nde Toluca (2372 toises), Popocatepetl (2772 toises), Itztaccihuatl (2456\r\ntoises), Cofre de Perote (2098 toises), and the volcano of Tuxtla (18° 28'\r\nN.), on the eastern slope of the Sierra St. Martin, from which a column of\r\nflame shot up with great violence on 2nd March, 1793, a fair specimen of\r\nwhat the Spaniards term _Malpays_, the Sicilians _Sciarra viva_. The face\r\nof the country is covered over with boulders of lava, at San Nicolas de\r\nlos Ranchos, at the foot of Popocatepetl, adjoining the city of Puebla de\r\nlos Angeles, after which, on the road from Puebla to Vera Cruz, will be\r\nobserved two narrow strips of boulders of cooled basaltic lava, rich in\r\nolivine. Similar examples will be found at Parage de Carros, near\r\nTochtilacuaja and Loma de Tablas, between Cancas and the Casas de la Hoja.\r\nThe mere ascension of volcanic cones is geologically of far less\r\nimportance, than the bringing away numerous specimens, carefully selected,\r\nof various trachytic rocks, which, by their oryctognostical composition,\r\nare characteristic of each volcano. I would nevertheless recommend that\r\nthe Pico del Fraile of the Toluca volcano (2372 toises) should be\r\nascended, proper caution being used. From this very sharp peak, I brought\r\naway thin plates of trachyte perforated by lightning, and within the holes\r\nof a melted glassy surface, resembling those brought from Little Ararat.\r\nBoth for the miner and geologist, an interesting and useful visit might be\r\npaid to the rich mines of Guanaxuato and the Mines de la Biscaina and\r\nRegla, on the road from Mexico to Real del Monte, so as to observe the\r\nclose connection subsisting between the richer silver ores, occurring in\r\ntrachytic porphyry without quartz, but with felspar, (glassy felspar?),\r\nand the thoroughly volcanic Cerro del Jakal, abounding in obsidian, and\r\nthe Cerro de las Navajas (Razor Range), which remind one of the environs\r\nof Schemnitz, with the sole exception, that the trachytes \"_porphyres\r\nmeulières_\" of Beudant, are wanting here.\r\n\r\nAs it is highly desirable that considerable time should be devoted to the\r\nvolcanoes of Quito, Peru, and Chili, it appears uncertain whether the\r\ncourse of the frigate, on leaving Acalpulco, will be shaped direct for\r\nGuayaquil, thus reversing the route taken by myself, or whether she will\r\nnot touch at some of the central American ports--Realejo or Sonsonate. The\r\ncrowded series of volcanoes in Central America, of which no less than\r\neighteen, conical or dome-shaped, may be considered as still in active\r\neruption, would yield a rich harvest of facts of all kinds in elucidation\r\nof the theory of volcanic action, such as have never hitherto been\r\nsufficiently taken advantage of. We are still in need of the mineralogical\r\ndetermination of the rocks, while the form and situation of the mountain\r\nmasses have been well described by Squier, Oersted, and other modern\r\ntravellers. The greater number, indeed, of the eruptions of scoriæ and\r\nslag were unaccompanied by streams of lava, as, for example, those of\r\nMount Isalco, abounding in ammonia. But recently eye-witnesses have\r\nfurnished us with quite different accounts regarding these eruptions, in\r\nthe case of several volcanoes--as the Nindiri (a twin volcano with that\r\ncalled Massaya), on which Dr. Scherzer has lately shed much light; the\r\nVolcano el Nuevo, erroneously called Volcano de las Pilas, that of\r\nCoseguina, situated on the Great Bay of Fonseca, and that of San Miguel de\r\nBosotlan, from which there flowed an extensive stream of lava in July\r\n1844. It would be most tempting to pass by land from Mexico southwards to\r\nOaxaca, and thence to the Isthmus of Guasacualco or Tehuantepec, and\r\nChiapas, so as to rejoin the frigate at Realejo or Sonsonate. Facts might\r\nbe obtained, in such a journey, of great value in determining the\r\ndependence of geological phenomena on each other; but it is to be feared\r\nit would be attended with too much fatigue and loss of time. For similar\r\nreasons, it cannot be proposed that the scientific gentlemen attached to\r\nthe Expedition, should leave the frigate for three or four months, when\r\nthey reach Central America, in order to cross by rail the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, with the object of examining the Volcancitos of Turbaco and Gabra\r\nZamba, both active, and thence ascend the Rio Magdalena from Carthagena de\r\nlas Indias, as far as Honda, whence they could proceed by Bogotà and\r\nPopayan to Quitó.\r\n\r\nIt will be also unavoidable to forego the examination of the sedimentary\r\nrocks, rich in fossils, between Honda, Bogotà and Ibagues, the Mastodon\r\nfields (_Campos del Gigante_), and the Salto de Tegumidama on the plateau\r\nof Bogotà, the wax palm (_Ceroxylon Andicola_), and the Azufrales of the\r\nPasso de Quindiu, the volcanoes of Tolima, measured by myself and ascended\r\nby Boussingault, and of Paramo de Ruiz (4° 15' N.), as also the two\r\nvolcanoes of Popayan, the Puracé and the much more interesting but now\r\nextinct Sotará. As a middle course, I may suggest a disembarkation, not\r\nexactly at Guayaquil, but on the gold and platinum coast of the Choco,\r\nnear San Buenaventura, so as to proceed thence to Popayan, and afterwards\r\nreturn to the volcanoes of the province of Pasto, which are highly\r\nimportant, and so on to Quitó, by way of Guachucal, Tulcan, and Villa de\r\nIbarra, rejoining the frigate only at Guayaquil.\r\n\r\nI believe, however, it would be more advisable to select Quitó as the\r\nstarting-point, whence to examine the important elevated volcanic region\r\nDe los Pastos (between 2° 20' and 0° 56' N.), containing the volcano of\r\nthe town of Pasto, the volcanoes of Tuguerres, Chiles and Cumbal, and the\r\nAzufral de Pasto, and not to land at any port of the Choco coast, not even\r\nfrom the Bahia de Cupica, which for half a century I have recommended in\r\nvain on account of its vicinity to the Rio Naipi, one of the tributaries\r\nof the Atrato. In drawing up a list of names of the volcanoes of the\r\nrenowned lofty plateau of Quitó, I may include, Imbaburu, Cotocachi, Rucu,\r\nPichincha, Antisana, the much-disputed question of the stony walls like\r\nstreams of lava, on the east slope of Tana Volcan, and Reventazon de\r\nAnsango; Cotopaxi, with its strange inexplicable quarries of pumice, of\r\nGuapecho and Zumbalica, in the neighbourhood of Llactacunga and San\r\nFelipe, the pumice containing oligoclase, not glassy felspar, deposited in\r\nstrata, like any rock _in situ_ for a considerable distance on all sides\r\nof Cotopaxi; Tunguragua (mica slate), studded with garnets, and beds of\r\ngranite, which dip under the former, and have themselves been pierced by\r\nthe trachytes of Tungurahua at Rio Puela and the Hacienda de Ganace; the\r\nhills of Moya, near the village of Pelilco, cast up in the celebrated\r\nearthquake of 7th February, 1797, and still in a state of activity; the\r\nChimborazo, which M. Jules Rémy, accompanied by an Englishman named\r\nPrinckley, was in the belief they had ascended, on the 3rd of November,\r\n1856, to the very summit, \"_mais sans s'en douter_.\" Poggendorff, (Vol. X.\r\np. 480), has clearly demonstrated that the boiling point given by Rémy for\r\nthe summit, would not give 6544 mètres (little different from my own\r\ntrigonometrical admeasurement of 6530 mètres), but fully 7328 mètres. As I\r\ndistrust my own half-barometical measurements, I have vainly implored\r\ntravellers, these fifty years past, to have a new series of\r\ntrigonometrical observations made of the summit of Chimborazo. The merit,\r\nthen, of settling this moot point, it also remains for the members of the\r\n_Novara_ Expedition to obtain.\r\n\r\nIt would be important to examine the Sangay (16,068 feet)--which, like\r\nStromboli, is in constant activity, yet without any traces of\r\nlava-streams--on account of the grains of quartz discovered by Wisse in\r\nthe trachytic boulders ejected by the volcano, which is of such rare\r\noccurrence in the trachytes out of Hungary; and also on account of the\r\nclose vicinity of beds of granite and gneiss, which are broken through by\r\nthe Sangay trachyte, forming an island, as it were, of not hardly two\r\nmiles in breadth. Still more deserving of attention is the extinct volcano\r\nEl Altar de los Collanes (Capac Urcù) a sketch of which I presented in\r\nthe atlas published in my \"Kleine Schriften\" (Plate V. p. 461), formerly\r\nhigher than Chimborazo, and still (?) 16,380 feet. Not a single specimen\r\nof its trachyte has ever been deposited in a European museum. The Altar\r\nitself is readily accessible from Riobamba Nuevo. In its vicinity may also\r\nbe seen mica slate and gneiss, cropping out at the Paramo del Hatillo near\r\nGuamote, and Teocaxas, which are so seldom fallen in with in the highlands\r\nof Quitó. Tradition relates that gold-mines were worked here during the\r\ndays of the Incas, in the neighbourhood of volcanic trachytes. From the\r\nAltar the geologist might proceed, by way of San Luis, (Query, whether the\r\nprimitive clay-slate found here be of the Silurian formation?) and\r\nGuamote, to Paramo del Assuay (2428 toises), and Cuenca, as far as Atausca\r\n(2° 13' S.), where an immense mass of sulphur, lying in a quartz seam is\r\nworked, forming a bed in the mica slate. Of what rock does the easily\r\naccessible Cayambe Urcù (18,170 feet) consist, crossing the Equator, S.E.\r\nof Otavalo? _En route_ from Quitó to Cayambe, the rich deposits of\r\nobsidian near Quinche should also be inspected, which furnished the large\r\nmirrors to the Incas, and farther to the north of which are the volcanoes\r\nof Los Pastos, which form a separate system by themselves.\r\n\r\nFor examining the rocks and exploring the volcanoes of Southern Peru and\r\nBolivia--respecting which see the last edition of Pentland's Maps, not\r\nthose published between 1830 and 1848, in which the height of Sorata was\r\nindicated at 3949 toises (25,257 feet), and Illimani at 3753 toises\r\n(24,004), and accordingly both as much more lofty than Chimborazo, which\r\nis 3350 toises (21,426 feet)--the best starting-point would be the port of\r\nArica, which may be reached, sailing the whole distance against the cold\r\ncurrent, from Guayaquil, after a short stay at Callao de Lima. Of the\r\nvolcanoes of Peru and Bolivia only three are now active.\r\n\r\n(_a._) The volcano of Arequipa, three miles N.E. of the town of the same\r\nname, which, according to Pentland and Rivero, is situated about 7366 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. The measurements of M. Dolley, of the French\r\nnavy, which were published under my superintendence, give the summit of\r\nthe volcano as 10,348 feet above the town of Arequipa, so that its total\r\nelevation above the sea would be 17,714 feet. In the table of heights for\r\nMrs. Somerville's \"Physical Geography,\" Mr. Pentland speaks of the summit\r\nas being 20,320 English feet in height, or 19,065 Paris feet, closely\r\napproximating to the old trigonometrical measurement (19,080 feet) given\r\nby Thaddeus Haenke, a Bohemian, who accompanied the expedition of\r\nMalaspina, in 1769. What a deplorable state for the science of hypsometry\r\nto be in! which the _Novara_ ought to put an end to. Samuel Anzon, a North\r\nAmerican, in 1811, and Dr. Weddell, in 1847, have ascended the volcano of\r\nArequipa.\r\n\r\n(_b._) Sahama (18° 7' S.), according to Pentland's new map of 1848, is 871\r\nfeet higher than Chimborazo (which he gives as 20,970 feet), and is still\r\nactive. The true heights of Illimani and Sorata, ascertained since 1848,\r\nare, instead of 3949 and 3753 respectively, only 3329 toises (21,266\r\nEnglish feet), and 3307 toises (21,145 English feet).\r\n\r\n(_c._) Volcano Gualatieri, in the Bolivian province of Carangas (18° 25'\r\nS.), height 20,604 feet.\r\n\r\nThe southern group of South American volcanoes, that, of Chili, presents\r\nthe largest number of active fire-mountains--only second, indeed, to that\r\nof Central America, there being from eleven to thirteen. In order to\r\nincrease the geological exploration of this region which has been so well\r\nprepared by the memorable expedition under Captain Fitzroy, in the ships\r\n_Adventure_ and _Beagle_, the excellent generalizing theories of Mr.\r\nDarwin, and the naval astronomical expedition of Mr. Gilliss, for 1849-51,\r\nthe _Novara_ will probably land at Valparaiso. A great desideratum between\r\nCoquimbo and Valparaiso is an exact measurement of--\r\n\r\n_A_. The volcano of Aconcagua (32° 39' S.). Its height has been stated, in\r\n1835, by Captain Fitzroy, as 21,767 feet, Pentland's correction assigning\r\n22,431 feet; while Captain Kellet, of the frigate _Herald_, gives it as\r\n21,584 feet. Miers and Darwin are both of opinion that the Aconcagua is\r\nstill in activity, which is denied by Pentland and Gilliss. The most\r\nrecent measurement of Aconcagua--that by Pissis in 1854 (see Gilliss, Vol.\r\nI. p. 63)--makes the height 20,924 feet. M. Pissis has published, in the\r\n\"Anales de la Universidad de Chili,\" for 1852, the geodetical elements of\r\nhis survey, which is based upon eight triangles. Aconcagua being probably\r\nthe highest mountain in the New World, a new measurement is eminently\r\ndesirable. Neither Dhawalagiri, with his 4930 toises, nor Kintsinjunga,\r\nmeasured by Colonel Waugh, with his 4406 toises, are any longer considered\r\nthe highest mountains in the Himalaya range, but the Deodunga (Mount\r\nEverest), which is 29,003 English feet, equal to 27,212 Paris feet, or\r\n4535 toises.\r\n\r\n_B._ The volcano Maipu (34° 17' S., height 16,572 feet), ascended by\r\nMeyen. The trachytic rock on the summit has broken through the Jurassic\r\nstrata, in which Leopold von Buch has ascertained, from heights of 9000\r\nfeet, the existence of _Exogyra couloni_, _Trigonia costata_, and\r\n_Ammonites biplex_. This volcano has no streams of lava, but only\r\neruptions of volcanic slags. It would be most desirable that Dr.\r\nHochstetter should examine this remarkable protrusion of dislocated\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\n_C._ The volcano Antuco (37° 7' S.), the geology of which was described by\r\nPöppig, is a lofty basaltic crater, having a trachytic cone rising up in\r\nits centre to an elevation of 8672 feet. It was observed in full activity\r\nby Domeyko in 1845. Gilliss gives an account of an eruption in 1853.\r\nAccording to Domeyko, a fresh-burning cone was thrown up on the 25th of\r\nNovember, 1847, which remained in activity for a whole year. Molina\r\nconsiders the Nevada Descabezado (35° 1' S.), ascended by Domeyko, to be\r\nthe highest mountain in Chili; but its height is estimated by Gilliss at\r\nonly 12,300 feet. The most southerly volcanoes are the still active\r\nCorcovado (43° 12' S.), 7046 feet; Yanteles (43° 29' S.), 7534 feet; and\r\nthe Volcan de San Clemente, opposite the granite formation on the\r\npeninsula of Tres Montes. Still further south, in 51° 41' S., another, the\r\nVolcan de los Gigantes, is laid down on the old maps of South America, by\r\nLa Cruz Olmedella, as opposite the archipelago of La Madre de Dios.\r\n\r\nShould the _Novara_ return to Europe through the Straits of Maghellanes,\r\nit would be very desirable the members of the Expedition should visit the\r\nlocality from which Prince Paul of Würtemberg, after long zoological\r\ntravels through North America, has, within the last year, brought back to\r\nGermany a very large collection of specimens.\r\n\r\nAltogether, I calculate the number of active volcanoes on the surface of\r\nthe earth to be upwards of 225--one-third of which, or 75, are upon the\r\nvarious continents, and the remainder upon the insular world. The Western\r\nContinent has 53 active volcanoes--of which, North-Western America, north\r\nof the river Gila, has 5; Mexico, 4; Central America, 18; South America\r\nabout 26. Viewing the globe as a whole, there presents itself an extensive\r\noblique region in which volcanoes most abound, stretching from S.E. to\r\nN.W. in the more westerly part of the Pacific, between 75° W. and 125° E.\r\nof Paris, and between 47° S. and 66° N. In this region, the fused elements\r\nof the interior of our earth may be said to be most permanently in\r\ncommunication with the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe greatest attention should be paid, with the view of improving them,\r\nto the sections and maps of Chili, contained in the work, \"Buenos Ayres\r\nand the Provinces of Rio de la Plata,\" published in 1852 by Sir Woodbine\r\nParish, and still more so, to that entitled \"Map of the Republic of Chili,\r\ncompiled from the Surveys of Gilliss, Pissis, Allen, Campbell, and Claude\r\nGay, between 23° and 44° S., as contained in Gilliss' 'United States\r\nAstronomical Expedition, 1847-52 Washington, 1855.'\"\r\n\r\nThe chief object to be aimed at by the _Novara_, with respect to\r\nscientific enquiry, seems to me to be the formation of a collection in the\r\nGeological Institute of Vienna, in comparison to which all the collections\r\nwhich at present aspire to be considered rich in volcanic specimens, (such\r\nas those of Berlin, Paris and London), should appear to be insignificant.\r\nIn all periods of history, travellers are only the representatives of the\r\nstate of knowledge of their own time, and consequently, collections always\r\npresent the readiest means of promulgating new discoveries by\r\noryctognostical examination or chemical analysis. In order to set on foot\r\na grand Volcanic Museum, it would be necessary to bring home from every\r\none of the volcanoes visited, not less than 10 or 12, but still better 15\r\nor 18, specimens of the porphyritic trachytes, all carefully selected,\r\nwell-shaped, containing crystals not disintegrated, and of sufficient size\r\nto admit of a fresh fracture being made. For such quantities, however,\r\nthere cannot be provided on board ship, even with the kindest patronage of\r\nthe commanding officer, sufficient space for the accumulations of two\r\nyears' arduous efforts in forming a collection. The greatest part,\r\ntherefore, should be sent by other conveyance to Trieste, the most secure\r\nchannel being through the consuls of the Austrian Empire, or those of\r\nallied powers, or through the medium of British, Dutch or American\r\nmercantile establishments, or by the regular packets.\r\n\r\nDuplicates, say four or five specimens, from each volcano, should be taken\r\non board the _Novara_ in boxes of about 3 feet long. It would be too\r\ndisheartening to have any misgivings of the success of this glorious\r\nscheme for getting together a Museum of Volcanic Rocks in Vienna, of all\r\nthe regions of the globe, arranged upon a regular geographical system,\r\neach labelled with its own name, so as to promote a general acquaintance\r\nwith these branches of knowledge:\r\n\r\n   1. Europe.\r\n\r\n   2. Atlantic Islands.\r\n\r\n   3. Continent of Asia, South Coast of Arabia (Aden), Kamtschatka.\r\n\r\n   4. Islands of Eastern Asia and India.\r\n\r\n   5. The Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\n   6. The Pacific.\r\n\r\n   7. Continent of South America: Chili, Peru, Bolivia, Quitó and\r\n      New Grenada.\r\n\r\n   8. Central America.\r\n\r\n   9. Mexico, south of the river Gila.\r\n\r\n   10. North-Western America, north of the river Gila.\r\n\r\n   11. West Indies.\r\n\r\nMuch of this work might be done on board the _Novara_. As to Nos. 3 and 4,\r\nKamtschatka, the Kurile and Aleutian Islands, the Red Sea, and the West\r\nIndies, it will not be difficult to procure specimens at some future\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nOur piping times of peace are favourable to the execution of this project,\r\nwhich should be zealously kept in view throughout the Expedition.\r\nTravelling as I was, during the great wars, I did not dare shrink from the\r\ndifficulty of having to carry along with me 44 large boxes, as I did on\r\nthe road through Mexico from Acapulco to Vera Cruz, whence they were sent\r\nto Cuba, Philadelphia, and so to Bordeaux. The mechanical labour of having\r\nthe collections carefully packed, keeping duplicates distinct, and sending\r\naway geological, botanical, zoological and ethnographical collections, is\r\nitself quite as important as the purely scientific work.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition of comprehensive volcanic collections brings to light the\r\nstrong analogy subsisting between the trachytes belonging to volcanoes,\r\nfar distant from one another, while it indicates the existence of great\r\ndifferences in the mineralogical composition of volcanoes situated very\r\nnear each other. My most excellent friend and fellow-traveller in Siberia,\r\nProfessor Gustavus Rose, recently subjected the trachytes of the Berlin\r\nMuseum, the greater number of which were collected by myself, to careful\r\ncrystallographical and chemical investigation. He found oligoclase and\r\npyroxene on the trachytes of Chimborazo, Popocatepetl, Colima,\r\nTunguragua, Puracé, Paramo de Ruiz, and the Peak of Teneriffe, which has\r\nrecently been accurately examined by Mr. Charles Deville. The trachytes of\r\nToluca, Orizaba, Gunung Barang, and Burung Agung, on the Island of Java,\r\nArgæus, in Asia Minor, Cuneguilla, south of Sta. Fé de Nuevo-Mexico, the\r\nSièrra de San Francisco, west of the Rocky Mountains and Pueblo Zuni,\r\nconsist of hornblende, oligoclase, and brown mica. The trachytes of\r\nStromboli and Etna, those of the Siebengebirge (Drachenfels), and of Kara\r\nHissar in Phrygia, consist of large crystals of glassy felspar, with\r\nnumerous smaller crystals of oligoclase, some hornblende and mica.\r\nOligoclase, having been mistaken for albite, led to the fantastic idea of\r\na peculiar rock, the _Andesite_, prevailing in the Andes, and even led our\r\ngreat master, Leopold von Buch, to make some curious distinctions,\r\n(Déscription des Iles Canaries, 1836, pp. 186-87.)\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the average height above the level of the sea, I propose that\r\nfurrows should be cut in the rocks of the different regions along with\r\ninscriptions, which might carry information to unborn ages, as has been\r\ndone, on my suggestion, now some 25 years ago, by the Academy of Science\r\nat St. Petersburg, on the Caspian Sea, while Sir James Ross, in his\r\n\"Voyage of Discovery in the Southern and Antarctic Regions,\" 1839-43, Vol.\r\nII. p. 23, regrets not having done so, or, at least, of having only once\r\nadopted this plan.\r\n\r\nI would also, with all deference, suggest observations regarding the daily\r\natmospheric variations or tides, so as to obtain tables of _maxima_ and\r\n_minima_. In order to obtain these, whenever the frigate is at anchor near\r\nany coast, but particularly within the tropics, hourly observations with\r\nthe barometer and thermometer (the latter affixed to the barometer, and\r\nalso freely suspended in the open air), should be made through several\r\nconsecutive days and nights. During the occurrence of an Aurora Borealis\r\n(or Australis), attention should be paid to the perturbations of the\r\nmagnetic variation, and the magnetic intensity of the horizontal needle.\r\nBoreal Auroras have been seen in the southern latitudes of the Peruvian\r\nPacific, as low down as 12° 13' S.; but the occurrence of such phenomena\r\nthere is of much less frequent occurrence than that of Austral Auroras in\r\nScotland. It is important to keep an exact register of the intensity of\r\nblackness in the \"coalbags,\" when the smallest stars surrounding them are\r\nstill visible to the naked eye. The daily meteorological observations, as\r\nalso those on the temperature of the sea, will probably be made on board\r\nship, in conformity with the views of Lieutenant Maury, and the method\r\nagreed upon at the last nautical congress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs I shall have long ceased to be numbered with the living, when the\r\n_Novara_ returns to Trieste, richly freighted with scientific treasures of\r\nall kinds, with fresh information relating to organic and inorganic\r\nnature, to the races of man, their habits and languages, I now pray to\r\nAlmighty God that His blessing may rest upon this great and noble\r\nenterprise, to the honour of our common German Fatherland! And\r\nconcluding, in this night, these oblique, illegible lines, I remember, not\r\nwithout emotion, and with very mingled feelings, that joyous period of my\r\nlife when, fifty-eight years ago, in the beautiful gardens of Schönbrunn,\r\npreparing myself for a long journey, I was enjoying with grateful mind the\r\nfriendly kindness of the venerable Jacquin and Peter Frank.\r\n\r\n                                                     A. v. HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\n Berlin, in the night of 7th April, 1857.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEPARTURE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\n                     Preparations for the Voyage.\r\n\r\n   Approbation of the Plan to fit out an Austrian Man-of-War for a\r\n     Voyage round the World.--Object of the Expedition.--\r\n     Appointment of a Scientific Commission.--Preparations.--\r\n     Fitting out the Frigate _Novara_ at Pola.--Departure for\r\n     Trieste.--Visit of the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian on board.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1856, His Majesty the Emperor was graciously pleased to\r\napprove of the proposal for a voyage round the world, as projected by his\r\nImperial Highness the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, the head of the\r\nAustrian navy, and to commission the sailing frigate _Novara_ for that\r\npurpose, a vessel qualified to meet every requisite condition.\r\n\r\nThe chief object of the Expedition--a circumstance which must not be lost\r\nsight of--was to afford the officers and cadets of the ship an opportunity\r\nof acquiring that practical acquaintance with naval affairs which, added\r\nto the theoretical knowledge previously attained, would render them\r\nthoroughly familiar with nautical routine, and thus materially contribute\r\nto the further development of the Austrian navy.\r\n\r\nThis branch of the public service, placed since 1848 on an entirely new\r\nbasis, has with difficulty worked its way through all those embarrassing\r\ncircumstances inseparable from the organization of a new system; but the\r\nhonest zeal and energy of the board appointed, supported by favour from\r\nthe highest quarters, have succeeded in introducing many improvements, and\r\nin increasing by degrees the numerical strength of the men, thereby laying\r\na secure foundation for the rising naval force, the importance of which,\r\nat this moment, every reflecting patriot will acknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe intended Expedition offered, besides the advantages for the service,\r\nanother not less important for the State, namely, the recognition of the\r\nAustrian flag in remote quarters of the globe, to which it had never\r\nhitherto penetrated; and by thus opening new channels for the outlet of\r\nour natural products and manufactured goods, to promote the industrial,\r\ncommercial, and maritime interests of the empire.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the scientific requirements of the age, the\r\nillustrious head of the navy issued orders, that the officers on board\r\nshould in every way assist in the researches to be made, connected with\r\nnavigation and geography; and was, moreover, pleased to invite the\r\nImperial Academy of Sciences to nominate two members, he himself naming a\r\nthird, to accompany the Expedition for the purpose of observing and\r\ninvestigating phenomena pertaining to the different branches of physical\r\nscience, as well as collecting rare specimens and interesting objects of\r\nnatural history. To this commission were ultimately attached a botanist, a\r\npractical zoologist, an artist, and a flower-gardener.\r\n\r\nThe Academy had, for the guidance of these gentlemen, drawn up\r\ninstructions which, with a multitude of other papers containing useful\r\nhints and interesting queries, received from the Imp. Geographical,\r\nGeological, and Medical Societies, as well as from numerous foreign and\r\nnative scientific men, formed a most valuable collection of materials for\r\nthe purposes of the Expedition.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Of these instructions, \"The physical and geognostical\r\nremarks,\" with which the Nestor of natural science honoured the voyagers\r\nof the _Novara_, being of a more general interest, are published at the\r\nend of this volume, together with the facsimile of an autograph letter of\r\nBaron von Humboldt to the commander of the Expedition.]\r\n\r\nForemost amongst these _savans_ stood Alexander von Humboldt, that\r\nillustrious man, who up to the last moment of his existence was alive with\r\nyouthful enthusiasm for every scientific enterprise. In England great\r\ninterest in the success of the Expedition was evinced by Sir Roderic\r\nMurchison, Sir W. Hooker, Sir Charles Lyell, General Sabine, Admiral\r\nSmyth, Admiral Fitzroy, Professor Robert Owen, Professor Philips,\r\nProfessor Bell, Professor W. A. Ramsay, Professor Goodsir, of Edinburgh,\r\nW. J. Hamilton, Esq., Charles Darwin, Esq., L. Horner, Esq., James Yates,\r\nEsq., B. Davis, Esq., &c., &c. From the United States of North America, we\r\nreceived most valuable communications from Commander M. F. Maury, National\r\nObservatory, Washington, D. C.--Captain Rodgers, and others.\r\n\r\nLetters of introduction were received from Germany, and particularly from\r\nEngland, to influential parties and societies in a variety of places\r\nabroad, amongst which were many warm and friendly recommendations from the\r\nEnglish Government and Admiralty, as well as the Directors of the then\r\nEast India Company, to various administrative authorities in the British\r\nColonies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUN-ROOM OF THE _NOVARA_.]\r\n\r\nThe frigate _Novara_ was laid up in the arsenal of Pola, where all\r\nrequisite steps were taken to complete her outfit, and prepare her\r\nthoroughly for the voyage. The ventilation of the lower deck was improved,\r\nand the number of cabins increased in proportion to the number of\r\nindividuals for whom accommodation was to be provided.\r\n\r\nThe gun-room was, by command of the Archduke, converted into a\r\nreading-room, and provided with a well-selected library as well as with\r\nall the charts and maps necessary for the information of the officers, who\r\nhere made their calculations and executed their drawings.\r\n\r\nThe store-rooms for the sails and tackle were enlarged, so as to hold a\r\ndouble quantity.\r\n\r\nA distilling apparatus, the same as patented by M. Rocher, of Nantes, was\r\nfixed on the gun-deck, and being placed in connection with the ship's\r\ncoppers, it was found that, during the few hours each day that the latter\r\nwere used for cooking, enough sea-water was distilled to supply the entire\r\nship's company with excellent water to drink. This distilled water, after\r\nhaving been kept in iron tanks for a month, was found pleasant to the\r\ntaste, and agreed very well with the health. The excellent health enjoyed\r\nby all the crew throughout the voyage must, in a great measure, be\r\nascribed to the circumstance, that scarcely any other but this distilled\r\nsea-water was used, so that the men were enabled entirely to forego\r\ndrinking river or spring-water, which in the tropics are frequently found\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\nThe use of such an apparatus permits a great diminution in the store of\r\nwater usually carried by a vessel. The space gained by this diminished\r\nbulk of water, enabled us to take on board a larger cargo of coal and\r\nprovisions, such as preserved beef and compressed vegetables. The sailors\r\nwere not, however, particularly fond of the preserved beef, because in\r\ncooking it loses a great part of its flavour (though the broth is strong\r\nand good); nor does it seem as an article of diet to have had a\r\nparticularly beneficial influence on the health, for the sanitary\r\ncondition of the crew was equally satisfactory, and the number of\r\nscorbutic patients not materially increased when, towards the end of the\r\nvoyage, the fresh stores were exhausted, and only salt and pickled rations\r\nwere issued.\r\n\r\nCompressed dried vegetables were of great benefit to the health of our\r\nmen, and cannot be sufficiently recommended. The so-called _melange\r\nd'équipage_ of Chollet, as well as _sauer kraut_, potatoes, and other\r\nvegetables, have an excellent taste, improve the soups when mixed with\r\nthem, and are easily preserved, provided they be protected from the effect\r\nof damp. Hence it might be advisable to keep them enclosed in\r\nwell-soldered tin boxes. The price of these vegetables is so moderate,\r\nthat it is surprising they are not more generally employed.\r\n\r\nThe long-continued satisfactory state of health of the crew must also\r\npartly be sought for in the constant use of shower-baths. For this\r\npurpose, apertures, three-quarters of an inch in diameter, were bored in\r\nthe planks of both the deck and forecastle, under which a perforated disc\r\ncould be screwed, and above which a pail of water was placed. By these\r\nsimple means every one was enabled to enjoy the luxury of a bath; when,\r\nhowever, the desire for that refreshment became general, so that the\r\narrangement above-mentioned was insufficient, a hand fire-engine was made\r\nuse of, so as to accommodate as many at once as might present\r\nthemselves--a process which found great favour with the jolly tars, as\r\naffording abundant opportunities for fun and merriment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERTICAL SECTION OF THE FRIGATE \"NOVARA.\"]\r\n\r\nThe frigate _Novara_ had been placed on the stocks in the arsenal of\r\nVenice in the month of February, 1845, and was launched in April, 1850.\r\nShe was pierced for 42 guns, but during the voyage carried only thirty\r\n30-pounders,[5] and four of smaller calibre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The 30-pounder marine guns answer very nearly to the English\r\n32-pounders.]\r\n\r\nThe principal dimensions of the frigate (Vienna measurement) are:--\r\n\r\n Length between perpendiculars      165 feet  5-1/2 inches.[6]\r\n Length of water line               156 \"     5       \"\r\n Greatest breadth                    44 \"     11-1/2  \"\r\n Greatest breadth on water line      43 \"     2       \"\r\n Depth of hold                       19 \"     3/4     \"\r\n Draught of water aft                18 \"     9       \"\r\n Draught of water fore               17 \"     5-2/3   \"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: 96-423/1000 Austrian feet = 100 English.]\r\n\r\nThe superficial area of the ship, or the load-water line, amounted to\r\n5685.35 square feet; quantity of water displaced 2107 Austrian, or 2630\r\nEnglish tons. The superficial area of the principal sails amounted to\r\n18,291 square feet.\r\n\r\nThe frigate proved herself to be an excellent sailer, as, of the various\r\nvessels which, throughout the voyage, sailed in company with us, only\r\nthree clippers outstripped her.\r\n\r\nThe question may here be asked, why, in the present state of navigation, a\r\nsailing-vessel was preferred to a steamer for this voyage? The principal\r\nconsideration which decided this selection was the greater disposable area\r\nwhich a sailing-vessel offers in comparison with a steamer of the same\r\ndimensions, in which coal and machinery occupy so large a space. On the\r\npresent occasion, it will be perceived that what was specially wanted was\r\nroom for as great a number of officers, cadets, and men as possible, who\r\nwere, as has been stated, to make this voyage for improvement in nautical\r\naffairs. Plenty of space was also required for the numerous instruments\r\nand bulky collections of objects of natural history; while in most parts\r\nof the ocean which we were to traverse, the winds blow so regularly, that,\r\nwith very rare exceptions, sails form the best motive power. The expense\r\nof fuel requisite for a steamer, and the trouble of replacing it during\r\nthe voyage, are thus saved; whilst, finally, the space occupied by the men\r\nemployed in the management of the machinery, and that required for the\r\nstowage of special stores, would be withdrawn from more important objects.\r\n\r\nAfter the frigate had been properly fitted up in the arsenal of Pola, she\r\nsailed on the 15th March, 1857, for Trieste, where she cast anchor on the\r\n17th in the Bay of Muggia. H.I.M.'s corvette _Caroline_, likewise fitted\r\nout at Pola for a voyage to the coast of South America and Western\r\nAfrica, followed in her wake, and it was now seen that the frigate was a\r\nbetter sailer than the corvette, a circumstance so much the more\r\nsatisfactory, that the latter had hitherto been considered the swiftest\r\nship in our navy.\r\n\r\nThe unfavourable state of the weather interfered so much with the works\r\nwhich were to be finished at Trieste, that the embarkation of provisions,\r\nswinging the compasses, &c., &c., could only be proceeded with very\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nAt last, the members of the Commission arrived, and the vessel only waited\r\nfor sailing orders.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving on so interesting an enterprise, with which the most\r\npleasing recollections of our lives will ever be associated, we had the\r\ngratification of being honoured by a visit on board from the Archduke\r\nFerdinand Maximilian. The commander of the Expedition introduced the\r\nofficers and scientific gentlemen to his Imperial Highness, who addressed\r\nthem in affecting terms, and concluded his remarks by expressing a hope\r\nthat the frigate _Novara_ would, with God's help, return happily from her\r\nmission to her own honour and that of the country.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the voyage is now presented, and, probably, the results\r\nof the various scientific investigations will very shortly be offered to a\r\ndiscerning public, leaving it to them to judge how far we have succeeded\r\nin realizing the hopes of the illustrious Prince. But if we have not\r\nsatisfied all the expectations entertained, it certainly was not from\r\ninsufficiency of means; for everything was complete in that respect, and\r\nwe owe it chiefly to the circumspection and kind care of the\r\nCommander-in-chief of our navy, that this enterprise had been so wisely\r\nplanned, and its details brought in so short a time to such a degree of\r\nperfection that, during the whole voyage, it was not found necessary to\r\nmake the slightest alteration in the original arrangements and\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEODETICAL AND ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOK-OUT MAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n                       From Trieste to Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n   Departure.--Fair Voyage down the Adriatic.--A Man lost and found\r\n     again.--Passage through the Straits of Messina.--The Steamer\r\n     _Sta. Lucia_ returns to Trieste.--Regulations and Instructions\r\n     for further Proceedings.--A Day on Board the _Novara_.--\r\n     Sunrise.--Cleaning the Ship.--Mental and physical occupation.--\r\n     Moonlight at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe departure of the frigate was fixed for the 30th April, 1857, and\r\nH.I.M.'s corvette _Caroline_, Captain Kohen, was ordered to accompany her\r\nas far as the coast of South America. H.I.M's steamer, _Sta. Lucia_,\r\nCaptain von Littrow, received orders to tow both ships as far as the\r\nextremity of the Straits of Messina to avoid loss of time, such as\r\nfrequently arises in the Adriatic during the spring, from calms and\r\nunfavourable winds.\r\n\r\nWith the dawn of the day fixed for the departure of the ships, all was\r\nbustle on board; craft of all kinds hovered around, and relatives and\r\nfriends had assembled in great numbers to take leave. The verdant and\r\nthickly-wooded slopes of the promenade to St. Andrea, near the shore, were\r\nthronged with spectators, and the fair and lovely picture of our native\r\ncoast developed itself once more before our eyes, clad in all its charms\r\nof spring, as if to wish us a hearty farewell, an auspicious voyage, and a\r\nhappy return!\r\n\r\nAt 8 o'clock A.M. we weighed anchor, and the steamer _Sta. Lucia_\r\napproached the _Novara_ for the purpose of towing her from the Bay of\r\nMuggia into the roads of Trieste. She had all her colours displayed, and\r\nsaluted the city of Trieste, Austria's chief and most important emporium,\r\nwith 21 guns. The salute was answered from the castle, whilst the band on\r\nboard struck up Haydn's beautiful hymn: \"God preserve the Emperor!\" The\r\nfrigate moved out of the road-stead, accompanied by a great number of\r\nboats, and followed by the best wishes of the numerous crowds assembled on\r\nshore, and of all true patriots, who looked upon this Expedition as a\r\ncheering evidence that a new and energetic spirit of enterprise had arisen\r\nin their native country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.--TRACK FROM TRIESTE TO MADEIRA.]\r\n\r\nThe corvette _Caroline_, which was waiting outside the roads, was attached\r\nto the frigate, and soon Trieste appeared like a dim cloud on the distant\r\nhorizon. The outlines of the Carinthian Alps became fainter, and the\r\nexcitement of the parting scene was calmed by that busy activity required\r\nfrom every one embarking on a long voyage, if he desires to attain any\r\ndegree of comfort, however little, in the cramped and limited space of a\r\ncrowded ship.\r\n\r\nA perfect calm, a smooth sea, and a but-slightly-clouded sky,\r\nprognosticated fair weather, and promised leisure to complete those\r\narrangements which had been left undone. The steamer _Sta. Lucia_\r\nperformed her task of towing the two vessels most satisfactorily, and,\r\nfavoured by the prevailing currents of wind and water, we made five miles\r\nan hour, and came, on the day of departure, in sight of the promontory of\r\nPola.\r\n\r\nThe passage down the Adriatic was on the whole most pleasant, with the\r\nexception of some showers of rain near the heights of Isola Grossa; which,\r\nhowever, on this occasion saluted us only with a slight puff of wind. The\r\nship moved so gently and quietly on her way, that those occupying the\r\nlower cabins could scarcely have fancied themselves at sea, had they not\r\nbeen made aware of it by other impressions.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May, the crew became highly excited by a man being missed,\r\nwhen the morning watch was called. Some thought he had, from fear of a\r\nslight punishment hanging over him, jumped overboard, but as nothing of\r\nthe kind had been observed by the watch on deck, every corner was\r\nsearched, but without success, upon which the man was given over as lost.\r\nWhen, however, the dinner hour arrived, and the tables and benches were\r\nbeing removed from the lower deck, how great was the surprise, when the\r\nculprit was discovered crouching among them! A peal of laughter roused the\r\npoor fellow, who this time was let off with the fright and the punishment\r\nof being made an object of ridicule by his comrades.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of May, being clear of the Adriatic, the steamer _Sta. Lucia_\r\nwas at midnight despatched to Corfu to complete her store of coal, whilst\r\nwe sailed for Cape Spartivento, on the Calabrian coast, which had been\r\nassigned as our _rendezvous_. On the 5th, we sighted this the most\r\nsoutherly promontory of Italy, when, in consequence of a fresh breeze, the\r\nsea began to make itself rather disagreeably felt. The novices on board\r\nbecame somewhat alarmed. A feeble voice was even heard, which endeavoured\r\nto prove from this phenomenon that man is a creature made for _terra\r\nfirma_, and not for the watery element; but this excellent idea came\r\nrather late; mankind are obliged to submit to existing circumstances, and\r\nthis thought alone held out some hope, that a longer stay on board would\r\nprove the best cure for the evil. Such indeed was the case; though pale\r\nfaces, want of appetite, and even worse effects, were produced, whenever\r\nthe ship made a heavier roll than usual. But these slight inconveniences\r\nof sea life became rarer and rarer, till at last they appeared only in\r\nreally stiff gales. On the 7th the steamer _Sta. Lucia_ returned and took\r\nus again in tow.\r\n\r\nThe weather during our passage through the charming straits of Messina\r\nwas delightful. The colossal Etna exhibited in all its glory its\r\nsnow-capped summit, gilded by the rays of the rising sun, and Messina\r\nshone with all the attractions of its splendid situation. The coast of\r\nthis part of Italy is mostly bare and rugged, the broken outlines of the\r\nmountains imparting to the landscape that characteristic peculiarity which\r\nmakes so deep an impression on the mind. We passed the famous Charybdis,\r\nin which a multitude of dolphins were disporting themselves. The\r\nneighbouring coast formed a brilliant panorama, and we kept so close in\r\nshore as to be able to distinguish the movements of the people. The\r\nappearance of our three goodly ships seemed to have attracted the\r\nattention of the inhabitants, for they stood in groups in the streets and\r\nsquares of Reggio and Villa San Giovanni, saluting us by waving their\r\nhandkerchiefs. When towards the evening we had passed the straits, we\r\ncould descry the Neapolitan coast as far as Monte Bulgario, in the Bay of\r\nPolicastro, and distinguish the imposing Stromboli, with its volume of\r\nsmoke, far on the Western horizon.\r\n\r\nThe following morning found us in sight of the small island of Alicudi,\r\nsituated on the north of Sicily. The estimable captain of the _Lucia_ came\r\non board to take leave, on his return to Trieste. The steamer, being\r\nrelieved of her burden, made her way briskly towards her destination; and,\r\nbefore an hour had elapsed, we could perceive nothing but a small streak\r\nof smoke in the haze of the horizon.\r\n\r\nWith light breezes, we came, on the following day, in sight of the island\r\nof Ustica. Sea-gulls (_Thalassidroma pelagica_) enlivened the scene, as\r\nthey, from time to time, flew after the garbage thrown from the ship, or\r\nsought for sea-nettles and other small inhabitants of the sea's surface.\r\nThese birds much resemble our land swallows, and their movements are so\r\ngraceful, that one cannot but admire them, especially when they lightly\r\ntouch the agitated water with their little webbed feet, and directly, as\r\nif repelled, withdraw. The muscular power of these feathered creatures is\r\ntruly wonderful; they follow the ship for entire days continually on the\r\nwing, ever on the watch to snatch at the little food which the sea seems\r\nbut scantily to supply to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"PALINURUS\".]\r\n\r\nWhilst we were passing down the Mediterranean, a great deal of time was\r\nemployed in drawing up regulations, and in digesting all those\r\ninstructions which had reached the Commander of the Expedition from all\r\nsides, and by which we were to be guided in our future proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe scientific gentlemen were the first who received certain rules for\r\ntheir guidance; for, life on board a ship, and especially of a man-of-war,\r\nis so entirely different from that on shore,--the etiquette and usages\r\npractised appear, to those unused to the sea, so vexatious and annoying,\r\nthat it was absolutely necessary to inform them of the regulations which\r\nare essential in order to keep so singular an organization as that of a\r\nship at sea in working order. Erelong every one perceived, that the\r\nmatutinal annoyance of holystoning the decks, the daily cleaning of\r\neverything on board, &c., are measures of importance, which contribute\r\nmaterially to the preservation of the health of the crew, and that a\r\nstrict observance of discipline is absolutely necessary to exercise their\r\npowers, and thus to fit them for all eventualities.\r\n\r\nFor the better accommodation of the naturalists, a place on the lower\r\ngun-deck was fitted up for those operations which, on account of the\r\nlimited space and noxious exhalations, could not well be performed in the\r\ncabins.\r\n\r\nWe had a large quantity of alcohol on board, destined for the preservation\r\nof interesting objects of natural history. In order to prevent any\r\ncalamity by fire arising therefrom, the whole quantity was put in a large\r\niron tank placed in the hold, and covered over with sand. It will,\r\nhowever, be seen in the sequel, that even this precaution proved\r\ninsufficient to protect the ship from the ignition of this\r\nhighly-combustible substance.\r\n\r\nThe meteorological observations, and those connected with the physical\r\ngeography of the sea, were entrusted to four officers, who, like those\r\nattached to the watches, had alternately to be at their posts, and had, at\r\nprescribed hours, to observe the barometer, thermometer, and psychrometer,\r\nas well as the temperature of the surface of the sea, the state of the sky\r\nand the ocean, and to note down the obtained results. One of the junior\r\nofficers was intrusted with the nautical observations on shipboard, as\r\nwell as the astronomical and magnetical on shore.\r\n\r\nThe midshipmen were at the same time trained by study and practice, so as\r\nto enable them to assist the officers in their duties. Besides the men on\r\nthe look-out, one of the midshipmen was employed on the same service. In\r\nstormy nights, when the wind is howling, and rain or snow falling, this\r\npost is certainly not very pleasant, but is, as may readily be imagined,\r\nmost important.\r\n\r\nLife in the limited space of a ship, completely cut off from the external\r\nworld, is so peculiar and interesting to those unacquainted with the sea,\r\nthat we will endeavour to describe a day passed on board the _Novara_,\r\nfrom the instant when at daybreak the bustle and activity begin, till the\r\nlate hour when night reminds one of repose, those sweet moments which\r\ncarry the voyager to his distant home on the wings of a dream.\r\n\r\nAs the sonorous bell strikes the fifth hour of the morning, the crew are\r\ncalled on deck by the boatswain's whistle, the hammocks are slung up and\r\nstowed away, and the work begins.\r\n\r\nThis is the busiest time of the day, and for the mere spectator the most\r\nuncomfortable. On all sides scouring, rubbing, sweeping are going on,\r\nfloods of water are streaming along the decks, and he who is not as yet\r\nfamiliar with these cleaning processes, runs some risk of a ducking as\r\nsoon as he makes his appearance outside his cabin. These morning ablutions\r\nare, however, indispensable evils on board ship, for cleanliness is a\r\ncondition essential to the preservation of health, and even the quantity\r\nof humidity which penetrates the timber, and renders the air damp, appears\r\nto be less injurious than the omission of these daily scourings.\r\n\r\nWhen the cleaning of the various parts of the ship is finished, the\r\nidlers, and such of the officers as are off duty, appear on deck, whither\r\npeople come to enjoy the fresh air, and to greet the opening day. It may,\r\nhowever, be permitted to observe, that a sunrise at sea, notwithstanding\r\nits various charms, is by far less imposing than the same scene on a lofty\r\nmountain, where the veil of night seems to vanish as if by magic, and\r\nluxuriant nature lies at our feet like a smiling infant awaking from a\r\nlovely dream. That wild majesty of scenery, that overpowering grandeur of\r\ngigantic mountain forms, such as one sees in the Swiss or Tyrolese Alps,\r\nis wanting at sea, where the rising sun pours his beams only over a\r\nboundless world of water.\r\n\r\nThe sailors breakfast at 7, the officers at 8, and the Commander at 9. At\r\nthe latter hour the bugle sounds the order to \"clear the ship,\" when the\r\ncleaning of arms, guns, and all other articles of metal connected with the\r\nship's armoury, begins. During this process the band plays cheerful airs,\r\nso that the work is done whilst keeping time with the music, which serves\r\nto lighten the labour. This duty requires to be completed within\r\nforty-five minutes, and terminates with an inspection of the men and their\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThis being over, officers and midshipmen off duty assemble together with\r\nthe naturalists in the reading-room. Most of the books in the library\r\nreferred to those countries likely to be visited by the Expedition, so\r\nthat every one might previously obtain useful information relative to\r\ntheir physical, historical, and social conditions.\r\n\r\nThe naturalists employ the greater part of the day in their cabins, noting\r\ndown their observations, and preparing for those to be made in the course\r\nof the voyage. The crew are kept in activity by being drilled and\r\notherwise occupied.\r\n\r\nThe men dine at 12; the dinner of the officers is served up at 3, and that\r\nof the Commodore at half-past 3 o'clock P.M. The remainder of the\r\nafternoon is spent in prosecuting the labours begun in the morning. Thus\r\nsteals on the evening, when a general assemblage takes place on deck, for\r\nair and exercise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAMEN OFF DUTY.]\r\n\r\nThe occurrences of the day, the sunset, the curious formation of the\r\nclouds, or the bewitching beauty of a brilliant tropical sky at night,\r\nform interesting topics for lively discussion. It is, however, rather\r\ndaring to institute a comparison between the splendour of the sky in the\r\ntropics and that of our higher latitudes. For, most men become more or\r\nless unjust towards the beauties of a new and foreign natural scenery, in\r\nconsequence of their not being able to divest themselves of former\r\nimpressions produced in them by phenomena of a similar nature. What\r\nimpressions are, for instance, deeper in young and old, and excite more\r\ndelightful recollections than the starry sky of home? And can it be\r\ndisputed that the association of ideas has a most powerful effect upon\r\nthe impressions made by those phenomena of nature which are so peculiarly\r\nattractive and so deeply fixed in the human mind?\r\n\r\nThe conversation generally becomes more lively on those evenings when the\r\nmoon, placid friend of the sailor, appears on the distant horizon,\r\nshedding her silvery beams over the unbroken expanse of water. The\r\ninfluence which she exercises on the state of the weather, even the\r\nprejudices and superstitions connected with our satellite, offer subjects\r\nof interesting debate; involuntarily the mariner looks with grateful\r\nfeelings towards that heavenly luminary, the mild soothing light of which\r\ndiminishes the number of his anxious nights, protects him in present,\r\nwarns him of remote dangers, and influences so powerfully that vast\r\nelement on which he passes the greater part of his life. Indeed he who has\r\never spent a dark and stormy night on the ocean, when the ship, lashed by\r\nthe fury of the waves, and borne resistlessly along, stands in constant\r\nperil of coming in violent collision with a vessel similarly\r\ncircumstanced, or of being dashed to pieces on some iron-bound coast of\r\nrugged rock, easily comprehends and will excuse the sailor who ascribes to\r\nthe moonlight somewhat of a supernatural and mysterious power.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, and notwithstanding the continued sameness, days and\r\nmonths glide away like hours, until we again cast anchor, and only the\r\nwork accomplished gives an idea of the length of time which has been\r\npassed at sea.\r\n\r\nSunday alone breaks the monotony of life on board, when, after the diurnal\r\ncleaning of the ship, and the inspection of the crew, the officers, and\r\nall the men who are not on duty, assemble for divine service on the lower\r\ngun-deck, where the chaplain says mass on a temporary altar, whilst the\r\nship's band performs sacred music. In the afternoon the men off duty amuse\r\nthemselves for a couple of hours with the \"_tombola_,\" a game much liked\r\nby our sailors. Between 6 and 7 P.M. the band plays on deck, whilst the\r\nsailors are cutting grotesque figures to the music. The singular capers by\r\nwhich all evince their happiness; the good-humoured awkwardness with which\r\neach clings to the brawny arm of his companion; the mock graceful air\r\nthose who enact the gentler sex assume in the dance, and, finally, the\r\naffected attitude with which the cavaliers bow to their partners as if\r\nthey really were of the gentler sex--all this is most ludicrous and\r\namusing. The playing the national dance \"Monferina\" always elicits a\r\nparticularly hearty reception. There is a peculiar charm in national\r\nmelodies, even though they awaken no political reminiscences like the\r\nMarseillaise, or the Rakoczy; they electrify alike the educated and the\r\nmen of the people; a thousand pleasing recollections suddenly crowd into\r\nthe memory, and when the well-known tunes strike the ear, the heart seems\r\nto live again in bygone times! As if touched by magic, the sailor from the\r\nAdriatic, as soon as the Monferina is struck up, seizes his neighbour by\r\nthe arm with a noisy shout and hurls him about in wild hilarity; his\r\nthoughts seem as if flying towards his distant home, where, in the country\r\ninn, with a buxom lass on his shoulder, he has waltzed away many a happy\r\nhour. The whole village, with all its familiar faces, seems to revive in\r\nhis memory during the playing of the melody,--now he fills his glass; now\r\nhe clinks it merrily with that of his companion; now he presses his\r\nsweetheart more closely to his side: Lo! suddenly a shrill whistle pierces\r\nthe air, the music ceases, the call is heard \"to fall in,\" and the yet\r\ndance-stricken sailor, suddenly, as if awakening from a sweet reverie, is\r\nonce more standing on the deck of the _Novara_!\r\n\r\nThe frigate, in the Mediterranean also, maintained her superiority as a\r\nsailer. The corvette _Caroline_ was able to keep the prescribed distance\r\nfrom the _Novara_ only by the latter reefing some of her sails. As some\r\nmagnetic observations were to be made at Gibraltar, and, as we had to\r\nascertain the results of the various chronometers on board, on the 12th of\r\nMay we signalled the corvette to take her own time and rejoin us at\r\nGibraltar, as we were anxious to avoid unnecessary detention.\r\n\r\nThe acquisitions of the naturalists had, as yet, been very scanty: to\r\ntheir great annoyance they could not even obtain any of the tortoises,\r\nwhich, from time to time, approached the ship, though they were repeatedly\r\nfired at, and on one occasion a boat was launched, in the hope of catching\r\nsome of them. The specimens which we saw were from fifteen to twenty\r\ninches in diameter; they mostly floated quietly on the surface, and seemed\r\nsleeping or basking themselves in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 16th May was exceedingly boisterous, and almost tangible\r\ndarkness prevailed; thunder, lightning, and occasionally strong easterly\r\nsqualls, raged furiously, and only subsided towards the morning, when it\r\ncleared up with fresh southerly breezes. Not being far from Cape de Gatt,\r\non the Spanish coast, prudence required us to change course, and, during\r\nthe continuance of stormy weather, to keep at a respectful distance from\r\nthe shore. Here a merchantman, apparently an American, bore down so close\r\nupon us, that, in the darkness, an unpleasant collision seemed\r\nunavoidable. However, we tacked about, and thus, fortunately avoiding our\r\ndangerous neighbour, safely proceeded on our course.\r\n\r\nIt is truly astonishing how often merchantmen, entirely forgetful of their\r\nown safety, from want of caution, or presumption, or it would occasionally\r\nseem, sheerly from acting upon peculiar and abnormal principles of\r\nnavigation, wantonly expose ship, men, and cargo to many dangers, which\r\nmight easily be avoided, particularly in cases where no tacking is\r\nrequired, and only a slight touch of the rudder would suffice to prevent a\r\ncollision, which is always attended with danger to the smaller ship. In\r\nthis respect the North Americans are very unpleasant neighbours on account\r\nof their national vanity, and the Dutch for their phlegmatic temperament\r\nand the indifference they evince on such occasions.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of May, the small rocky island of Alboran, in the narrow part\r\nof the sea between Africa and Spain, was observed; being flat and without\r\nvegetation, it is scarcely perceptible, and the land-fall during the night\r\nshould be carefully avoided. The erection of a lighthouse on this island\r\nwould certainly be regarded as a great boon by all who navigate the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of May, the sea suddenly assumed a peculiar orange colour; a\r\ndust-like covering was observed on the surface of the water, and at some\r\ndepth white points might be seen, mingling with each other in the wake of\r\nthe ship. Clouds of this orange-like matter appeared spread upon the sea,\r\nwhich thereby lost its usual transparency. On closer examination this\r\nphenomenon appeared to arise from a mass consisting of myriads of minute\r\nanimalculæ, which had a yellow opaque kernel, the gelatinous covering of\r\nwhich was transparent and colourless. A quantity of sea-water impregnated\r\nwith this matter, having been brought into a dark room, gave out a light,\r\nand when agitated, such brightness proceeded from it, as justified the\r\nanticipation that, during the night, the whole sea would be illuminated.\r\nAccordingly the wake of the ship was illuminated by a wonderful stream of\r\nlight, in the depths of which larger masses of luminous matter could be\r\ndiscerned, whilst on the surface there was a sparkling and glittering, as\r\nif all the stars of the firmament were reflected in the water.\r\n\r\nThis phosphorescence of the sea, for the explanation of which we are\r\nchiefly indebted to Professor Ehrenberg, proceeds for the most part from\r\nthe emanations of light from molluscæ of the genus _Medusa_, and other\r\nliving phosphoric animalculæ; sometimes, however, as for instance in\r\nVenice, it arises from the putrescent fibres of decayed molluscæ, and\r\nother organisms in a state of decomposition.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 20th the splendid Ceuta Light was seen, which, even\r\nat a distance of twenty miles, looks as if it were quite near. This\r\nlighthouse is of the utmost importance to ships emerging into the Atlantic\r\nfrom the Mediterranean, as the current is exceedingly powerful, and during\r\nthe night is apt imperceptibly to carry a vessel out of her course. On the\r\nmorning of the 21st, the ship lay in a calm before the rock of Gibraltar.\r\nBarren, gray, and gloomy rose now before our sight this rocky,\r\ngun-studded, colossal sentinel of that vigilantly-prudent, energetic, and\r\njealous Power, which is so constantly seeking to extend her rule wherever\r\nher own interests are concerned, or where she thinks it advisable to make\r\nherself respected by other nations.\r\n\r\nA light breeze sprang up, and at half-past 3 P.M. the anchorage, eleven\r\nand a half fathoms in depth, was reached. The frigate now lay in front of\r\nthe Alameda or public gardens of Gibraltar, situated near the town gate,\r\ncalled the Ragged Staff. This anchorage is tolerably safe at this season,\r\nbut in autumn and winter, as well as generally in strong easterly winds,\r\nit is not to be recommended, it being preferable to haul further in\r\ntowards the place where the merchant-vessels usually lie. We saluted the\r\nEnglish flag on the fortress with twenty-one guns, which were immediately\r\nanswered from the ramparts. There were no English men-of-war in the Roads,\r\nexcept the sloop _Curlew_, Capt. Horton. The following morning our\r\nconsort, the _Caroline_, anchored in our vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe first day of the arrival of a man-of-war in harbour is attended with\r\nmuch inconvenience, particularly if she carries the flag of the\r\nCommodore, or it happens that the mail packets are arriving or departing,\r\nor that there are many ships of war in the Roads. The latter was not now\r\nthe case, but so many visitors, letters, and newspapers arrived at once,\r\nthat neither the one nor the other could be thoroughly enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe local authorities, the governor, Sir James Fergusson, at their head,\r\nwere extremely obliging and attentive; Mr. Falkland, an officer of the\r\nEngineers, was placed at our disposal; a specially-reserved site was\r\nassigned us for astronomical and magnetical observations; huts were\r\nerected by the workmen of the arsenal for the protection of the\r\ninstruments, and in short everything, calculated to promote scientific\r\nlabours, was provided. The Chancellor of the Austrian Consulate, Mr. John\r\nFrembly, himself a geologist, proved likewise to be of great service to\r\nour scientific men: and it was considered a fortunate omen to have found,\r\nat this our first anchorage, so much sympathy with the objects of the\r\nExpedition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF GIBRALTAR FROM SEAWARD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCK OF GIBRALTAR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\n                              Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n             STAY FROM THE 20TH TO THE 30TH MAY, 1857.\r\n\r\n   Political Significance of the Rock.--Courtesy of the British\r\n     Authorities.--Fortifications.--Signal Stations.--The only\r\n     place in Europe frequented by Monkeys.--Calcareous Caves.--\r\n     Chief Entrances into the Town.--Shutting the Town Gates.--\r\n     Public Establishments.--Inhabitants.--Elliott's Gardens.--The\r\n     Isthmus, or Neutral Ground.--Algeziras.--Ceuta.--Commerce and\r\n     Navigation.--Excellent regulation in the English Navy relative\r\n     to Officers' Outfit.--Small-pox appears on Board the\r\n     _Caroline_.--Departure from Gibraltar.--A Fata Morgana.--The\r\n     _Novara_ passes the Straits.--Take leave of Europe.--Voyage to\r\n     Madeira.--Floating Bottles to ascertain the Currents.--Arrival\r\n     in the Roads of Funchal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis remarkable promontory, which in our days has obtained so much\r\npolitical importance, the Calpe of the ancients, constituted of old, with\r\nthe opposite Abyla,[7] the so-called pillars of Hercules, celebrated, at\r\nthe same time, as the boundary of the then-known world. It derives its\r\nname from the corrupted Arabic _Gebel_ (mountain) and _Tarik_, the name of\r\na Moorish conqueror, who had pitched his camp here (A.D. 711). Like a\r\ncolossal giant, guarding the portal of Europe, and converted, by the\r\nenergy and ingenuity of the British, into an almost impregnable outpost,\r\nthis precipitous rock has, as regards the Mediterranean, the same high\r\nstrategic importance for that great maritime people, as Heligoland for the\r\nGerman Ocean, Aden for the Red Sea, Ceylon and Singapore for the Indian\r\nArchipelago, Hongkong for the Chinese waters, or the Cape and St. Helena\r\nfor the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The present Apes Hill.]\r\n\r\nGibraltar was already strongly fortified, when it belonged to the\r\nAndalusian kingdom, but its grandest fortifications date from the treaty\r\nof Utrecht (1713), when it became an appanage of the British crown.\r\nStupendous and incomparable are the works which since that period have\r\nbeen executed on it, though the calcareous formation of the locality and\r\nits numerous caves may have considerably facilitated their construction.\r\n\r\nThe English authorities, who so kindly assisted in the scientific\r\nresearches, obligingly furnished each individual of the frigate's staff\r\nwith a written permission to inspect the fortifications as often as they\r\npleased, and thereby afforded them the particular gratification of being\r\nable to view and admire these vast structures in all their details.\r\n\r\nExcellent and well-kept roads lead to the principal fortifications, which\r\nonly begin at an elevation of several hundred feet above the town. The\r\ngalleries, hewn in the solid rock, forming a kind of casemates, are of\r\nsuch breadth and height that they may be conveniently traversed by a man\r\non horseback with his hat on. They have been constructed at an immense\r\nexpense of labour and money, and are designated by various names, as\r\n\"Upper gallery,\" \"Lower gallery,\" \"Queen's gallery,\" \"St. George's Hall,\"\r\nand so on. Their extent is estimated at an English mile, but is probably\r\nmuch greater. Besides these galleries, passages run for miles in the\r\ninterior of the rock, affording the garrison a thoroughly-protected\r\nconnection with all points that may chance to be threatened.\r\n\r\nThe grandest and most imposing of these marvellous excavations are the\r\n\"Queen's gallery\" and \"St. George's Hall.\" According to carved\r\ninscriptions, most of them were begun and completed between the years 1783\r\nand 1789. At the period of our visit, there were mounted on the different\r\nfortifications 707 guns, about one hundred of which peeped out of the\r\nsmaller embrasures. Since that date, however, the number is said to have\r\nbeen increased so as to amount now to about 1500.\r\n\r\nDuring the stay of the _Novara_, it fortunately happened that the birthday\r\nof Queen Victoria was celebrated, and thus an opportunity was offered of\r\nseeing the fiery mountain in full activity. Though the occasion was\r\npeaceable, yet the imposing spectacle gave a tolerable idea of the\r\nelements of destruction which Gibraltar could put in action if really\r\nattacked. The governor of the fortress, surrounded by a brilliant staff,\r\nin which the Spanish governor of Algeziras and his officers played but a\r\nsorry part, reviewed the garrison, consisting of infantry, cavalry, and\r\nartillery, to the number of from 5000 to 6000 men; and whilst the troops\r\ndefiled in slow and quick step, lightnings and thunders issued from all\r\nthe crevices and embrasures of the artificially-perforated rock; huge\r\nvolumes of dense smoke followed, and a rolling subterraneous rumbling gave\r\nthe mountain exactly the character of a volcano suddenly burst into\r\naction. The echo of these salvoes of rejoicing must have been heard, not\r\nonly in the adjacent parts of Spain, but also on the more remote coast of\r\nAfrica; and he who was ignorant of the real cause, might have supposed it\r\na grand rehearsal of that fearful tragedy which the English seem\r\ndetermined to perform in the event of an attack. The supposition, however,\r\nthat the guns of Gibraltar are able entirely to command the Straits is\r\nerroneous, for these, at their narrowest part, are 12-1/2 miles wide, and\r\nnot even the Armstrong guns, with which the fortress has lately been\r\nfurnished, have so extensive a range. The English are, however, able to\r\ncommand the Straits by a fleet, which would find in the Bay of Gibraltar a\r\nsufficiently safe and roomy anchorage.\r\n\r\nFrom the fortifications, a narrow and rather steep path leads to the\r\ntelegraph station, at an elevation of 1300 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. Steamers and men-of-war, as soon as visible, are signalled from this\r\npoint by means of immense balls and flags. It would be very difficult to\r\nsignal merchantmen in the same way, as, during a prevailing westerly wind,\r\nmultitudes of ships often appear to the eastward of the rock, anxiously\r\nwaiting for a favourable easterly breeze to carry them through the\r\nStraits; in the same way the westerly horizon is sometimes crowded with\r\nships, prevented by contrary winds from entering the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWe found at the station an Aneroid-barometer, and a thermometer. The\r\nadvantages for navigation and physical science of extensive meteorological\r\nobservations, regularly made, are so evident, that it is astonishing to\r\nsee how often opportunities are neglected for making them, such as are\r\noffered here.\r\n\r\nThere was no opportunity for seeing any of those families of monkeys, the\r\noccasional appearance of which on the Rock of Gibraltar has given rise to\r\ntales found in books of travel of the existence of a submarine\r\ncommunication, through which this single representative of the genus in\r\nEurope has found its way to this rock from Africa. Sometimes, however,\r\nduring easterly winds, single individuals are observed on the highest\r\npeaks on the eastern side of the rock, where it is completely\r\ninaccessible; probably the remnants of that species (_Inuus ecaudatus_),\r\nwhich at some former time, either by chance, or human agency, have found\r\ntheir way hither from the Moorish coast.\r\n\r\nThe calcareous caves are very remarkable. That on the western side, called\r\nSt. Michael's, situated at a height of 800 feet, is the most important. It\r\ncontains beautiful stalactite formations, and seems to be of considerable\r\nextent; it has, however, not been closely examined hitherto, as only a\r\nsmall part is conveniently accessible. St. Martin's Cave, on the\r\nsouth-east, likewise about 800 feet above the level of the sea, is\r\nsmaller, but its stalactites are of a purer whiteness. A third was\r\ndiscovered a few years since on the eastern side of the rock at a height\r\nof only 80 feet, the lower portion of which consists of accumulations of\r\nsand and recent shells. There have also been found bones and teeth of\r\nlarge herbivorous animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCK CAVERN IN GIBRALTAR.]\r\n\r\nThe characteristic vegetation of the mountain is Spanish broom (_Spartium\r\njunceum_), the yellow blossom of which strikes the eye pleasingly at a\r\ngreat distance. There is also one species of cactus, and one of the dwarf\r\npalm (_Opuntia vulgaris_, and _Chamærops humilis_), which grows in great\r\nabundance, and forms, on the south face of the rock, almost the only\r\nvegetation, whilst, on account of difference of temperature, it is\r\naltogether absent on the remaining sides.\r\n\r\nGibraltar has little to attract strangers to settle; barracks, military\r\nstore-houses, and fortifications, render the appearance of the place\r\npeculiarly monotonous, the more so that there are no elegant buildings, or\r\nfine shops, on the rock. There was nothing observed, however, to confirm\r\nthe statement, in a celebrated geographical work, copied by all later\r\ncompilers, that \"most of the houses are painted black, to soften the glare\r\nof the sun, and prevent an attacking enemy having a distinct view of the\r\nplace.\" The town, which is built in terraces on the side of the rock, is\r\naccessible only from three points. The greatest portion of the traffic\r\npasses through the so-called Old Mole at the north end, whilst the\r\nentrances on the south are generally used by men-of-war sailors only. All\r\nare opened at 5 in the morning, and, according to the season, shut between\r\n7 and 8 in the evening, precisely twenty-five minutes after the first\r\nsignal-gun. This closing of the gate is attended with ceremonies verging\r\non the comic. A broad-shouldered corporal, carrying in his hand a heavy\r\nbunch of immense keys, marches, visibly impressed with the importance of\r\nhis mission, in measured steps, accompanied by a number of red jackets\r\nwith fixed bayonets, towards the massive town-gate; the bridge is then,\r\nwith much ado, drawn up, and the horribly-creaking gate, with great\r\nexertion, closed, bolted, and finally locked. After \"gun fire\" no one can\r\nleave the town by the Old Mole; at 10 P.M., however, and at midnight, a\r\nlittle postern is opened, through which those jolly stragglers, who have\r\nforgotten in merry company the measure of time, may slip out to return to\r\ntheir floating abodes. From this hour till morning all communication with\r\nthe harbour is arrested, and the utter impossibility (except in\r\nextraordinary cases) of leaving the town _after_ this hour, has given rise\r\namongst the people to the saying, \"There is only _one_ thing more\r\ndifficult than to get _out_ of the town after midnight, and that is to get\r\n_in_.\"\r\n\r\nThere are in the city two Anglican churches, one Wesleyan, one\r\nPresbyterian, two Catholic chapels, and two synagogues. The garrison\r\nlibrary, where likewise a great number of journals and magazines are kept,\r\npossesses 22,000 volumes, amongst them several very rare and costly works,\r\nespecially of ancient Spanish literature. It was founded in 1793 by\r\nCaptain Drinkwater, and has been hitherto kept up by private subscriptions\r\nand the profits arising from a printing-establishment attached to it.\r\n\r\nGibraltar owes to the energy and public spirit of the governor, Sir James\r\nFergusson, the foundation of several important establishments and\r\nundertakings. Since the beginning of his administration in 1856, the\r\nnumber of public schools has been considerably increased, the town\r\nsupplied with gas, and well-arranged public baths established.\r\n\r\nThe city does not possess a single well or spring; the water used is\r\nobtained from tanks, in which the rain is collected. The quantity of rain\r\nthat fell during the twelve months of 1855 amounted to 78 inches; in 1856,\r\nit is said to have been only 24 inches. Nevertheless, there is at no time\r\nany scarcity of water. The Government have lately caused the erection of\r\na distilling apparatus for making sea-water fit for domestic purposes,\r\nwhich, however, hitherto has not been used.\r\n\r\nThe population of Gibraltar, including the garrison of 6000 men, amounts\r\nto about 20,000 souls, consisting of Spaniards, English, Italians (mostly\r\nGenoese), Portuguese, Moors, Turks, Greeks, and Jews; indeed, a mixture of\r\nraces, customs, and manners such as scarcely can be found at any other\r\nplace in Europe. The native residents call Gibraltar briefly _the rock_,\r\nand themselves, with a kind of pseudo-patriotism, _rock people_, though by\r\nthe officers of the garrison and navy generally complimented with the name\r\nof \"rock-scorpions.\"\r\n\r\nThe permanent settling of foreigners, in consequence of its being a\r\nfortress, requires a number of formalities, which have the effect of\r\nlimiting the population; and even the English portion must be considered\r\nmigratory, as it consists chiefly of military and government officers,\r\nwho, after the lapse of certain intervals, exchange in regular order.\r\n\r\nThe only really beautiful walk in the place is Elliott's Gardens, situated\r\nat the south end of the town, laid out in a grand style, but disfigured by\r\na tasteless bronze statue of General Elliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield),\r\nthe heroic defender of Gibraltar in 1782. In the evenings, when one of the\r\nmilitary bands is performing, the grounds are thronged by visitors on\r\nfoot, horseback, and in carriages, whilst loving couples, of all races and\r\ngrades, ramble in happy union through the shady avenues.\r\n\r\nNear the gardens, towards the south, is a second quarter of the city,\r\nwhich mostly consists of government buildings. On the lowest terrace,\r\nwhich juts furthest into the sea, stands the lighthouse, on the celebrated\r\n\"Europa Point.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH GATE, GIBRALTAR.]\r\n\r\nGibraltar is connected with the Spanish continent by a sandy neck of land,\r\ncalled by the Spaniards _El Istmo_, and by the English \"the neutral\r\nground.\" It runs between the Mediterranean and the bay, one mile and a\r\nhalf in length and 2700 feet in breadth. This plain, which is not more\r\nthan 10 feet above the water, owes its origin to the formation of a dune\r\nin the rocky bed of the ocean. Strong easterly gales seem by degrees to\r\nhave accumulated the sand on this shallow run of the sea, which formerly\r\nseparated Gibraltar from Spain.\r\n\r\nA similar sand formation, near Catalan Bay, has attained the enormous\r\nheight of 1000 feet. The Government have caused a portion of the sand, at\r\nthe point where the isthmus joins the rock, to be excavated, and the water\r\nof the bay to be let in, so that there only remains a narrow low dyke of\r\nfirm ground, which probably in time of war may be completely submerged.\r\nThe stagnant water of this cut must, however, during the hot season,\r\nconsiderably increase the amount of fever.\r\n\r\nFrom May till October the troops are encamped under tents on this isthmus,\r\nalong which the neighbouring Spaniards come to market daily in crowds,\r\nwith provisions of all kinds, displaying their rancour against the foreign\r\nintruders by endeavouring to make them pay the highest possible price for\r\ntheir produce.\r\n\r\nThe adjacent Spanish settlements, Campamiento and St. Roque, are much\r\nresorted to by excursionists from Gibraltar, and, during the summer, are\r\nselected by numerous families for even a longer stay; for however little\r\npleasure or interest a ride over this arid and sandy plain affords, once\r\narrived at Campamiento, the rider enjoys a most charming prospect, while\r\nthere is probably no other point from which the isolated rock appears more\r\ngrand or picturesque than from this neat little village.\r\n\r\nIn following the road that runs from Campamiento along the bay, the\r\ncharming little town of Algeziras is reached. It lies on the western\r\nshore, exactly opposite Gibraltar, with which it is in regular\r\ncorrespondence by daily steamers.\r\n\r\nAlgeziras, formerly a poor fishing-village, has greatly increased in\r\nextent and prosperity, through the smuggling trade. This clean and\r\npretty-looking place has a population of 10,000 souls, and makes by\r\ncontrast an extremely pleasant impression on coming from the dismal and\r\ngloomy fortress. Men and things here have quite an Andalusian appearance.\r\nThe small but neat one-storied houses are mostly painted a bright white,\r\nand ornamented with green verandahs; at almost every window beautiful\r\nflowers are exhibited; and the public promenade, shaded by fine trees, is\r\ndelightful. The principal square is likewise planted with trees, and the\r\nlower stories of its houses are occupied by apothecaries' shops,\r\ncoffee-rooms, confectioners, and one by a bookseller even. The churches\r\nappear in every respect insignificant; the hospital of San Juan de Dios,\r\nhowever, is an ancient and noble structure, the management of which is\r\nadmirable. One of the arrangements here was eminently characteristic of\r\nSpain: in the ward for male patients stands at the upper end, by the side\r\nof the beds for common patients, a large, broad, elegantly-polished\r\nbedstead, which, the porter told us, was intended for \"_caballeros_.\"\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the town is the Amphitheatre Constantia, a large\r\nwooden booth, said to hold nearly 9000 spectators. It is chiefly used for\r\nbull-fights, which always attract a large audience. The aqueduct here,\r\ntaken with the fine scenery around, forms an exceedingly picturesque\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Gibraltar sometimes make excursions to the peninsula of\r\nCeuta (the Sebta of the Moors), situated on the opposite coast of Africa.\r\nThe lighthouse of this little promontory has been lately furnished with a\r\nFresnel apparatus, throwing out a most intense light, which is visible at\r\na greater distance than any other observed during our voyage. This place,\r\nwhich is used by the Spaniards as a penal settlement, numbers 6500\r\ninhabitants, and has a very indifferent harbour. The \"rock people\" also\r\noccasionally make excursions to Tangier, the most westerly town of the\r\nstrait, and the most important as regards the commerce of Morocco.\r\n\r\nA great number of steamers on their various routes touch at Gibraltar, for\r\ndischarging and embarking freight and passengers, and to coal. The\r\nquantity of the latter thus shipped is estimated at 30,000 tons annually,\r\nall imported from England. There is also a regular correspondence by\r\nsailing vessels with all the leading Italian ports, and those of the\r\nLevant, as well as with Constantinople, Corfu, and Trieste.\r\n\r\nGibraltar being a free port, there are no customs' dues, except those on\r\nwines and spirits. All flags enjoy equal privileges, and in all disputes\r\nthe English law decides. It is impossible to obtain a satisfactory\r\nstatement of the amount of imports and exports, as no Custom-house exists,\r\nand the official reports merely give the number and nationality of the\r\nflags of the ships that arrive and depart. Smuggling is carried on to a\r\ngreat extent, and, being a lucrative trade, will continue to be so, as\r\nlong as Spain retains her prohibitory duties on English goods.\r\n\r\nThe principal items of commerce in Gibraltar are English cotton goods,\r\nwhich are exported to Barbary in considerable quantities. To compete\r\nsuccessfully with the English in this branch of trade would be very\r\ndifficult for any other nation; but there are a great number of other\r\narticles which might find a ready sale on the African coast, and which are\r\nproduced cheaper in several States of the European continent than in\r\nEngland; a consideration of so much the more importance in trading with\r\nthe Moors, that these people regard lowness of price rather than the\r\nquality of the goods.\r\n\r\nFor this very reason, small but industrious Belgium has become a powerful\r\ncompetitor of mighty England. Thus, for instance, that country exports to\r\nMorocco, by way of Gibraltar, sugar, both in loaves and crushed,[8]\r\nhardware and cutlery, nails and screws, zinc, as well as all sorts of\r\nearthenware and glass. A portion of these articles goes into the\r\nneighbouring Spanish provinces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The superior quality and cheapness of Belgian sugars have of\r\nlate in a great measure driven all others out of the market. It is also\r\nworthy of remark, that though Gibraltar is a British colony, all the\r\naccounts are kept in Spanish currency, and that there are more Spanish and\r\nFrench coins in circulation than English, which, when changed, even\r\nsustain a small loss. The Spanish measures and weights also are more in\r\nuse than the English.]\r\n\r\nIt is rather singular that the Belgian glass goods are in Gibraltar\r\nrepresented as of _German_ manufacture, and thereby obtain a readier sale.\r\nThis seems to be a proof that German (_i. e._ Bohemian) glass articles\r\nhave been patronized before the Belgian, and lost the market only through\r\nthe importation of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse between Gibraltar and Spain is carried on by coasting\r\nvessels, and by French as well as Spanish steamers, while the postal\r\ncommunication with Great Britain is conducted by the Peninsular and\r\nOriental Steam Packet Company.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence with Spain and other parts of the Continent is carried on\r\noverland, but is little to be relied upon, as, owing to the horrible\r\ncondition of the Spanish roads, a delay of from six to eight days\r\nsometimes occurs in bad weather. Between Gibraltar and Cadiz, a distance\r\nof only sixty English miles, the letter-bag is said to have often been six\r\ndays on its way.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of our stay at Gibraltar would be defective if we omitted\r\nmention of the numerous proofs of hospitality we experienced on all sides.\r\nInvitations were repeatedly received from the Convent (Government House),\r\nas well as from private families, and everywhere we experienced the most\r\ncordial reception.\r\n\r\nWe must in particular mention a visit paid to Captain Warden, the\r\nsuperintendent of the station and arsenal, as it afforded an opportunity\r\nof becoming acquainted with a feature in the English naval service, as\r\npractical as it is worthy of imitation. The superintendent of the arsenal\r\ninhabits a beautiful roomy house, belonging to the Government, situated in\r\na large garden, well planted with splendid plane-trees, laurel, and\r\norange-trees, and ornamented with most beautiful and odoriferous flowers.\r\nAs a superintendent's income would not admit the outlay necessary properly\r\nto furnish so large an edifice, this is done by contractors, who let out\r\nthe furniture at the rate of five per cent. annually on the value. This\r\nsum is deducted monthly from the pay. The same system is also adopted on\r\nboard English men-of-war. The cabins of the officers are there furnished\r\nand provided with all the requisite comforts by contractors under the\r\nsuperintendence of the Admiralty. The value of each article is marked in a\r\nprinted list deposited with the authorities. The captain pays a yearly\r\nrate of five per cent. on the valuation, and binds himself besides, in the\r\nevent of the ship's being paid off, or of being appointed to another\r\nvessel, to return in good condition all the articles specified, and pay\r\nthe value noted in the list for everything missing. This agreement is\r\nregistered at the Admiralty, and the contractor receives the amount\r\nmonthly. The advantage of such an arrangement to the commander of a ship\r\nwill be more fully appreciated by those who, from personal experience, are\r\naware of the expense attending an outfit, and the great loss which an\r\nofficer transferred from one ship to another suffers through a sudden and\r\nforced sale of his property. The commander of a ship is moreover often not\r\nin a condition to spend for his personal outfit a sum of perhaps a\r\nthousand pounds sterling, but he can conveniently pay annually from £40 to\r\n£50 for the hire in monthly instalments; and it thus becomes easier for\r\nhim to maintain the appearance due to his position.\r\n\r\nThe commander and officers of the _Caroline_, which, after an absence\r\nsince the 12th of May, had rejoined us on the 23rd, were, like ourselves,\r\nreceived in the kindest manner by all the authorities of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that we should make the voyage to Madeira in company\r\nwith the _Caroline_, but an unexpected incident prevented it. The\r\nsmall-pox[9] made its appearance on board, and although in a mild form and\r\nin but a few cases, yet it was sufficiently alarming to interrupt, as a\r\nmatter of precaution, all communication, and to postpone indefinitely her\r\ndeparture, as a great part of the crew might be overtaken with the disease\r\nwhilst at sea, exposed to sudden changes of temperature, thereby causing\r\nthe most serious consequences. Such is not the case with diseases which\r\nare in some degree localized, as cholera, yellow fever, dysentery, &c.,\r\nwhen it is even prudent to set sail, notwithstanding the presence of the\r\nmalady, as a change of place and climate is frequently accompanied with\r\nbeneficial results.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: As there has lately been some difference amongst the medical\r\nmen of Europe as to the utility of vaccination, the following observations\r\nfrom the report of Dr. Wawra, the principal physician on board the\r\n_Caroline_, regarding the appearance and the course of this epidemic, may\r\nnot be out of place:--\"A day before our departure from Trieste a man\r\ncomplained of a slight fever and headache, and his skin was covered with\r\nspots which were judged at once to be indications of an approaching\r\neruption of small-pox. The man was immediately sent on shore as a matter\r\nof precaution; but, nevertheless, eight days after our departure we had a\r\nsecond, and ten days after that a third case: the epidemic was on board,\r\nand though in a mild form, yet serious consequences were apprehended. The\r\n_re-vaccination_ of the men was therefore decided upon, and carried out,\r\nas far as the virus on board would admit. Only five individuals of the\r\nwhole had not been vaccinated at all; some had undergone the operation in\r\ntheir childhood, a great part of them, however, had been vaccinated on\r\nboard other vessels, from two to five years before. Only fourteen cases\r\noccurred. Most remarkable, and evidently in favour of those who advocate\r\nre-vaccination, is the fact, that amongst most of those who had been\r\nvaccinated in their childhood, the disorder was more severe than among\r\nthose who had been re-vaccinated on board the ship. Among those who had\r\n_never_ undergone the operation before, the vaccination on board was most\r\nsuccessful; not one of them caught the disorder. Among the _re-vaccinated_\r\nonly four cases occurred, with slighter symptoms than among those who had\r\nbeen once only operated upon. We met with several instances of the kind at\r\nother places where we touched. At Buenos Ayres, where the vaccination laws\r\nare stricter than anywhere else, the small-pox is extremely rare. Among\r\nthe Brazilians, who entertain an absolute prejudice against vaccination,\r\nthe _variola_ is one of the most common and most frightful diseases. It\r\nprevails still worse amongst the negro slaves, among whom, from the\r\nignorance and prejudice of their masters, vaccination is neglected. The\r\nwhite marks of the disease are particularly visible in the black skin, and\r\nare evident proofs how virulently it has raged amongst them.\"]\r\n\r\nAfter we had got through our duties at Gibraltar, an attempt was made,\r\nwith the first favourable wind, to set sail and reach the Atlantic; the\r\n_Caroline_ remaining behind for the benefit of the sick on board. She was\r\nto follow only when the health of the crew no longer excited any\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th May the wind changed to south, and as the current in the\r\nharbour was also favourable, we weighed anchor in the hope that in the\r\nStraits we might meet with an easterly wind. The _Novara_ passed the\r\n_Caroline_, which saluted with a round of cheers, when we tacked to clear\r\nthe roads, after which all sail was hoisted to beat out against the\r\nwestern current in the Straits. The sea was covered with a mucous\r\nsubstance, which generally indicates that there is scarcely a chance of a\r\nfresh breeze; however, even the little we had, would have sufficed to\r\ncarry us through the Straits, but towards 6 P.M. a perfect calm overtook\r\nus, and notwithstanding the press of sail, we were carried back towards\r\nthe East, and about midnight found ourselves again in the Mediterranean,\r\nwhich did not seem disposed to part with us. There was no improvement next\r\nday, and at sunset we were exactly twenty-five miles east from the point\r\nwe had occupied the preceding day. The clouds passed from West to East\r\nacross the moon, and in the night from the 31st of May to the 1st of June\r\nthe westerly wind became so fresh that we had even to reef the sails.\r\n\r\nCurrent, wind, sea, everything was against us; even tacking was of no\r\nservice, as we lost ground visibly with each tack. When at last all hope\r\nof making the West had disappeared, we anchored, like many others of our\r\ncompanions in sorrow, on the 1st June, at 6 P.M., in the Bay of\r\nFrangerola, fifteen miles north of Malaga.\r\n\r\nHere were anchored nearly sixty merchantmen, all wind-bound. Behind the\r\nPunta Molinos, near Malaga, there must have been quite as many more. Fresh\r\nadditions were constantly being made to the already considerable fleet,\r\nwhich had involuntarily collected together, whilst those merchantmen which\r\nwith fruitless obstinacy kept on tacking about us, were getting more and\r\nmore out of their course, as with every successive hour their position was\r\nchanged for the worse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INHABITANT OF FRANGOLA.]\r\n\r\nIn the hope of a favourable wind we were all a-taunto on the 2nd June,\r\nperfectly prepared for a start. Under these circumstances no one could go\r\non shore, but an officer was despatched in a boat to make inquiries as to\r\nwhether there were any sanitary board in the neighbouring village. A\r\nrelative of the President of the Junta de la Sanidad came on board, and\r\nstated that, though as a rule only vessels clearing from Spanish harbours\r\nwere permitted to have intercourse with the shore, an exception should be\r\nmade in favour of ourselves. This Andalusian was very communicative, and\r\namongst other things told us that the inhabitants were supported almost\r\nentirely by fishing. Many ships had now been waiting several weeks for a\r\nfavourable wind to pass the Straits. Some had thrice attempted to sail\r\ntowards the West, but in every case were driven back by wind and current.\r\nIn 1847, a year of scarcity, Louis Philippe had caused several French\r\nsteamers to be stationed in the Straits in order to take in tow ships\r\ncoming from the Black Sea laden with grain, and thereby to facilitate\r\ntheir passage between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. In the afternoon\r\nwe had a visit from about thirty inhabitants of Frangerola, who came on\r\nboard in fishing-boats to view the ship. None of these people had ever\r\nseen so large a man-of-war, and they all therefore regarded the ship with\r\ngreat curiosity. The ship's band greatly delighted them, but the\r\nsignal-gun at sunset seemed to terrify them and to hasten their departure.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we felt from time to time some warm blasts of wind from the\r\neast, and enjoyed for nearly an hour the delightful spectacle of a \"Fata\r\nMorgana.\" This phenomenon, as is well known, arises from two currents of\r\nair of a different density, separated by a distinctly-formed plane,\r\ngenerally produced when the temperature of the two currents happens to\r\nvary. When, for instance, as is frequently the case at sea, a considerably\r\nwarmer current of air comes suddenly in contact with a colder current\r\nhaving a lower position, the plane of separation of the former becomes\r\ncondensed, and forms a mirror for all those objects which are in the lower\r\ncurrent, so that their image is inversely reflected. As this surface of\r\nseparation is not level throughout, various contractions and distortions\r\nresult, which impart to the whole a singular appearance. On land, as for\r\ninstance in the deserts of Africa, where the warmer current of air is on\r\nthe surface of the ground, the aërial mirror is formed beneath the eye of\r\nthe observer, by which the same phenomenon is produced that results from\r\nthe reflection of objects on the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nIn the present case the temperature of the atmosphere was about ten\r\ndegrees higher than that of the sea's surface at the point of\r\nobservation. The surface of the current of warm air appeared like a light\r\nfog, inclining in the East towards the Spanish coast, and in the\r\nSouth-east to South towards the surface of the sea. Where it was highest\r\nit reached nearly five degrees above the horizon. The images of the ships\r\nat anchor near Malaga, and those at sea under sail, appeared reversed, and\r\nassumed curiously fantastic forms, particularly in those places where the\r\nreflecting surface became irregular, and inclined towards the horizon. The\r\nappearance of these distorted ships in the air, joining in the most\r\nsingular way the real ones actually floating on the sea,--the warm vapour\r\nwhich is from time to time wafted on the face of the observer, as well as\r\nthe perfect and almost death-like stillness which, under such\r\ncircumstances, prevails both on the sea and in the atmosphere, may easily\r\nproduce the belief in a mysterious power, among a people who are generally\r\nprone to ascribe to supernatural agencies every phenomenon they cannot\r\nunderstand or explain.\r\n\r\nThis \"Fata Morgana\"[10] was not merely interesting in itself, but also gave\r\nreason to indulge in the hope of a favourable wind. A light easterly\r\nbreeze accordingly sprang up towards midnight, the current became\r\nreversed, the anchor was weighed, and all sail made with this favourable\r\nwind towards Gibraltar, the rock of which was distinctly recognizable\r\nthrough the misty air, at a distance of nearly sixty miles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The name Morgana is of Breton origin, and signifies \"sea\r\nwoman,\" from _mor_, sea, and _gan_, a fine woman;--the fairy mermaid of\r\nEnglish legendary tales.]\r\n\r\nA calm still prevailed near Europa Point, but as the day wore on, the\r\neasterly breeze blew strong through the Straits, and, in company with\r\ninnumerable other ships, the Pillars of Hercules were at length passed.\r\nThe wind freshened, and the frigate cracked merrily on down mid-channel;\r\nfor, though the set of the current was dead against us, yet the wind\r\nproved more than a match for it, which in our case was the more apparent,\r\nthat those merchantmen which sailed along the coast, not having the\r\nadvantage of this wind, seemed as though left motionless in the rear.\r\n\r\nWhen towards noon the _Novara_ was off the place where the _Caroline_ had\r\nbeen anchored, that ship was no longer visible. She had probably set sail\r\nin the morning. We supposed her to be among the crowd of ships which were\r\nsailing in the fog, but did not discover her, even after we had overtaken\r\nand examined all of them. We now endeavoured to reach the Atlantic as\r\nspeedily as possible, making from nine to ten knots an hour, and, with\r\njoyful sensations, sailed through those beautiful straits, on whose shores\r\nthe ancient world unrolled its grand panorama, thanking Providence here,\r\nat the entrance of that vast ocean, which now shone so brilliantly, that\r\nwe were permitted to carry the Austrian flag into distant regions.\r\n\r\nAt 4 P.M., aided by the fresh evening breeze, we passed the most southerly\r\npoint of Europe. We were just going to dinner when the last glimpse of the\r\nold world passed before the cabin windows, and we gazed once more with\r\nsorrowing eyes at the rapidly-disappearing coast, which, illuminated by\r\nthe rays of the setting sun, seemed to wave us a last farewell in letters\r\nof fire. However beautiful, however inspiring the prospect of our task;\r\nhowever inviting the magnificent ocean that lay extended under our eyes,\r\nmagically lit up by the silvery beams of the bright moon shining from a\r\nstarry sky, yet the painful sensations of parting with that old world,\r\nwith which so many pleasing associations--so many cherished recollections\r\nwere bound up, had a powerful influence, and gave rise to melancholy\r\nimpressions, of which we were only relieved by the comforting hope that we\r\nshould one day return to all so dear to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPE TRAFALGAR.]\r\n\r\nThe night was delightful. Not a single cloud obscured the sky, and the\r\nship, with all sails swelled by a fair wind, ploughed the dark waves,\r\nleaving a glittering track behind. We were now on the ocean! Below, blue,\r\nfoam-crested billows; above, the sky studded with stars;--below, the wide\r\ndesert of the sea; above, the infallible guides to lead us safely through\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe awoke to new activity on that great element, which conceals so many\r\ncharms and so many hardships, where the continued alternations of hope and\r\nfear, of enjoyment and privation--where weariness and disappointment, and\r\nyet again the new strength imparted by returning success--so excitingly\r\nanimate, and so gloriously manifest the innate power of the human mind.\r\n\r\nLife on board, the various excitements at sea, the different countries and\r\npeople seen during a voyage, all tend to arouse feelings and sensations\r\nwhich are reserved for the mariner alone, and which render his life, if he\r\nknows how to use it properly, happy and most enviable. At sea the mental\r\nand physical eye gains strength, man there seeks to unravel Nature in all\r\nher phases, and to know and to admire more thoroughly her works. The\r\nseaman owes his energy, his straightforwardness, and his piety, to a life\r\nspent in the midst of nature, to his direct intercourse with creation.\r\nBetween him and the Sovereign of the Universe there is, as it were, no\r\nmediator--he lives and labours uninterruptedly on the steps of the throne\r\nof his Creator and Preserver. In this great temple he directs to Him alone\r\nhis complaints, his thanks, and his prayers. At sea he learns law and\r\norder from Nature herself in her constantly-recurring functions; here he\r\nadmires the omnipotence and goodness of God in the sunrise after a stormy\r\nnight, and in the brightness of the moon that lights up his path; here he\r\nlearns by his actual experience the truth of that maxim of life, that \"God\r\nonly helps him who helps himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe wind, hitherto easterly, chopped round to the North-east, which,\r\naccording to Maury's excellent directions and charts, may be considered as\r\na trade wind, and in this season might be called so. In fact, the trade\r\nwinds are produced by a current of air, which is directed towards the\r\nEquator, and only in consequence of the earth's motion round its axis\r\nacquires a north-easterly direction to the north of the equator, and a\r\nsouth-easterly to the south of it. But the trade winds become perceptible\r\nat a certain distance from the equator, or rather from the hottest zone of\r\nthe earth's surface; and it is clear, that when the zone assumes a greater\r\nbreadth, the boundary of the trade winds is extended further towards the\r\npoles, as the position of this zone and its heat obtained from the sun are\r\nthe causes of these phenomena.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the case in these waters; Africa, with its sandy deserts,\r\npresents a broader zone of the greatest heat than is possible on the sea,\r\nand the trade winds, accordingly, reach further towards the north. Its\r\ndirection, however, cannot always be north-easterly, and depends\r\nnecessarily on the direction of the northern boundaries of this zone of\r\ngreatest heat. Accordingly, we at first had a more northerly wind, which\r\nin our progress towards Madeira became much more easterly. The weather\r\ncontinued on the whole beautiful, the sea was calm, and only the increased\r\nlength of the waves showed the greater expanse of water we were now\r\nnavigating.\r\n\r\nWe overtook some other ships, which were sailing towards the west. As we\r\nsaw nothing of the _Caroline_, we concluded that she was considerably\r\nahead. The current, which near Gibraltar has a westerly direction, tending\r\ntowards the Mediterranean, loses its power at a distance from the land,\r\nand half-way to Madeira it changes its direction in such a way that the\r\nship is carried imperceptibly southwards, though only a few miles a-day.\r\nThis current is a lateral branch of the great Gulf Stream, which from the\r\nGulf of Mexico is directed towards England, but about the latitude of New\r\nYork sends off a branch in a south-easterly direction, which passes round\r\nMadeira, and, near the Canaries, takes a parallel direction with the coast\r\nof Africa and forms the commencement of the Guinea current. The\r\ntemperature of the sea water, which in the midst of this current is\r\ngenerally rather higher than that of the air, indicates to the mariner\r\nthat he is in the Stream, and he must take care that his ship is not\r\ncarried more to the south out of its course than he wishes. This shows\r\nclearly of what importance ocean-currents are to navigation; and it\r\nbecomes evident that it is the duty of the scientific navigator not only\r\nto find out their direction and strength, but to use all means at his\r\ncommand, in order to ascertain their general movement in given districts\r\nof ocean.\r\n\r\nFor this latter purpose, it is customary (as often as circumstances seem\r\nto render it advisable) to throw overboard, and commit to the mercy of\r\nthese currents, a well-corked empty bottle, in which has been deposited a\r\ncard with the name and position of the ship. The bottle thus prepared, and\r\nmade conspicuous by a covering of white linen cloth, or some such\r\nmaterial, wanders hither and thither with the current, until it is picked\r\nup by some other ship, or is stranded anywhere on _terra firma_. The fact\r\nof such a bottle having been picked up is usually published, together with\r\nthe particulars enclosed, by means of which it is obvious that an estimate\r\ncan be formed of the average strength and direction of the current.\r\n\r\nAt 1 P.M. each afternoon, it was our custom to despatch one of these\r\nocean-posts, under given conditions; but only rarely did we afterwards\r\nreceive any information with respect to them. In each bottle was placed a\r\ncard with the following particulars, written in German, English, French,\r\nItalian, and Spanish:--\r\n\r\n\"H.I.M. frigate, _Novara_, such and such a day of the week and month, hour\r\nat which thrown overboard, Longitude from Greenwich, Latitude. Whoever\r\nfinds this bottle, which is about being thrown overboard well-corked and\r\nin good order, is requested to forward for publication, to the nearest\r\nspot at which there is a newspaper, the day, hour, latitude and longitude,\r\nin which the bottle has been found, together with the particulars of a\r\nsimilar nature already enclosed.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 7th June, towards evening, we were not more than 55 nautical miles\r\ndistant from the E. point of Madeira, and as the wind was favourable and\r\npretty fresh, it became necessary to shorten sail, so as to reach the\r\nanchorage by daybreak.\r\n\r\nAbout 2.30 A.M., a vessel was perceived, which, by its lights, was made\r\nout to be a man-of-war. We now burned a port fire which was not merely\r\nreplied to, but accompanied by signalling the number of the _Caroline_.\r\nShe was steering exactly our own course, and after having had to struggle\r\nwith calms on nearing the coast, we cast anchor together, in the roads of\r\nFunchal, in 32 fathoms, sandy bottom, immediately South of the Loo Rock, a\r\nsingular-looking, lofty, conical rock, which marks the best anchorage for\r\nlarge ships. The U. S. corvette, _Dale_, lay in our vicinity, and sent a\r\nboat on board with an officer to extend to us the usual greetings, after\r\nwhich she saluted the Commodore's standard with a salute of thirteen\r\nguns,[11] which, as is the etiquette, we returned, gun for gun. We now had\r\nthe pleasure of hearing that the small-pox had entirely disappeared on\r\nboard the corvette _Caroline_, those attacked being now in a fair way of\r\nconvalescence, while on board the _Novara_, the health of the ship's\r\ncompany was eminently satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Commodores of other nations receive only eleven guns by way\r\nof salute.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOO ROCK (MADEIRA).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE IN MADEIRA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n                               Madeira.\r\n\r\n               FROM THE 8TH TO THE 17TH OF JUNE, 1857.\r\n\r\n   First Impressions.--Difficulty in Landing.--Description of the\r\n     Island.--History.--Unfavourable political circumstances\r\n     connected with the cultivation of the ground.--Aqueducts.--\r\n     First Planting of the Sugar-cane.--Culture of the Vine.--Its\r\n     Disease and Decay.--Cochineal as a compensation for its loss.--\r\n     Prospects of Success.--Climate.--A favourable Winter Residence\r\n     for the Consumptive.--Strangers.--First Appearance of the\r\n     Cholera.--Observations with the Ozonometer.--Great Distress\r\n     among the Lower Classes.--Liberal Assistance from England.--\r\n     Decline of Commerce.--Inhabitants and their Mode of Life.--\r\n     Decrease of the Population, and its Causes.--Benevolent\r\n     Institutions.--Public Libraries.--The Cathedral.--Barracks.--\r\n     Prison.--Environs of Funchal.--Excursion to St. Anna.--Ascent\r\n     of the Pico Ruivo.--Singular Sledge Party.--Return to\r\n     Funchal.--Departure.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelightful and striking is the first impression of Funchal, its luxuriant\r\ngardens smiling with gorgeous flowers, and its mountain sides cultivated\r\nalmost to their summits; and although the grander and more gigantic forms\r\nof true tropical vegetation are wanting, and the landscape displays rather\r\nthe character of an island off the shores of Italy than of the torrid\r\nzone--still Nature exhibits herself here with such varied charms that\r\nimagination can scarcely conceive a sweeter or lovelier scene. The most\r\nbeautiful plants of the temperate and sub-tropical zones meet here in\r\ntheir highest development, whilst some representatives of the tropics\r\nintermixed enhance the richness of the wonderful picture. Odoriferous\r\nmagnolias, large flowering tulip trees, plane trees, laurels, myrtles,\r\nacacias, passion and trumpet flowers, tree-like fuchsias with immense\r\nblossoms, gaudy hortensias, sweet-smelling roses, blooming oleanders,\r\naloes, 40 feet high, in full flower, imposing camellias with shining green\r\nfoliage, covered with beautiful rose-like flowers, chestnut trees,\r\nBrazilian pines, cypresses--all delight the eye, together with\r\npomegranates, tamarinds, bananas, sugar-canes, coffee-shrubs, gigantic\r\ndragon trees, pine-apples, mangroves, papayas, and aquacatés. Certainly,\r\nat a later date, we met in the primitive forests of the Nicobar islands,\r\nor in Java, Luzon, and the Caroline islands, with grander and more\r\nimposing scenery; but none that surpassed in fragrance, luxuriance, and\r\nloveliness the floral beauty of Madeira.\r\n\r\nThe anchorage of Funchal[12] is merely an open, exceedingly unsafe\r\nroadstead, which affords so little protection to ships that often in\r\nsoutherly winds they are obliged to get under sail. This is especially the\r\ncase in the winter, when the sea often rushes into the small unprotected\r\nbay with fearful violence. In October, 1842, five vessels were cast on\r\nshore within the space of a few hours, and another sank whilst at anchor;\r\na similar violent gale from the south raged in December, 1848, when a like\r\nnumber of ships met with the same fate, and were dashed to pieces. The\r\nBritish sloop of war _Daphne_ only escaped by making the open sea in time.\r\nIn order to run less risk of being surprised by such gales, sailing\r\nvessels generally cast anchor to the south of the Loo Rock, where there is\r\ntolerably safe anchorage at a depth of twenty-five to thirty fathoms. In\r\nthat position they are clear of the rocky headlands, and can therefore\r\nmore easily set sail before the sea rushes in with all its irresistible\r\nviolence. Steamers, which are better able to resist the force of the waves\r\nthan sailing vessels, generally cast anchor nearer the shore, so that\r\npassengers may be more easily landed, and coals shipped with greater\r\nfacility.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The Portuguese for fennel-field, because the first\r\ndiscoverers of the island found this plant in great abundance.]\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese Government has done nothing to compensate for the\r\nshortcomings of nature with regard to safe landing-places in this island,\r\notherwise so highly favoured. Though the rocky condition of the Funchal\r\nroads, (the only anchorage for larger ships which the island possesses,)\r\noffers sufficient means for the construction of a harbour for boats and\r\nsmall vessels, yet the Government has hitherto done so little, that the\r\nlanding of passengers can only be effected by small, peculiarly-built\r\nboats, which, whilst tossed by the waves, have to be drawn on shore by the\r\nnatives wading knee-deep in the water. If, therefore, the ship remains any\r\nlength of time at Funchal, the communication with the land is attended\r\nwith considerable expense. We laid out, in payments to the boatmen, during\r\na stay of nine days, the sum of forty-five Spanish piastres[13] (£9 15s.\r\nsterling), although they had not over-charged us.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Spanish piastre = 4s. 4d. at par.]\r\n\r\nThe formalities at the custom-house, which strangers--even those belonging\r\nto a ship-of-war of a friendly Power--have to go through, are extremely\r\nannoying, and entail a great loss of time. Before landing, passengers'\r\nboats are boarded in the open roads by officers, who are stationed a few\r\ncable lengths from the shore. On landing, the stranger is obliged to\r\nrepair to the custom-house, where even small and open packages are\r\nsubjected to a second rigid examination. The time lost during this\r\nprocess, unnecessarily minute, is exceedingly unpleasant. The reason\r\nassigned for these vexatious regulations is the extent to which, of late,\r\nsmuggling has been carried on in the island, and which, in the opinion of\r\nthe Governor, required these measures of precaution. It seems, however,\r\nthat this system rather promotes contraband trading, by making it very\r\nlucrative. The Austrian consul, Charles Bianchi, Esq., did all in his\r\npower to diminish the frequency of the continual examinations, and\r\nlikewise, in all other respects, endeavoured to promote the objects of the\r\nExpedition.\r\n\r\nThe greatest length of the island of Madeira, from Ponta Furado in the\r\neast, to Ponta do Pargo, in the west, amounts to 30 miles; its greatest\r\nbreadth, from Ponta do Cruz in the south, to Ponta do Saõ Jorge in the\r\nnorth, is 12-1/2 miles, and its area is about 240 square miles. This\r\nvolcanic and mountainous island is intersected by innumerable deep ravines\r\nand defiles, and its whole surface is so much broken and irregular, that\r\nthe representation Columbus once gave to Queen Isabella, of the Island of\r\nJamaica, when she asked him for a description of its configuration, might\r\nperfectly be applied to the aspect of Madeira also. The great navigator,\r\nafter having crushed a sheet of paper in his hand, and partly opened it\r\nagain, placed it on the table, saying, he could convey to Her Majesty no\r\nclearer idea of that island than that crumpled piece of paper afforded.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the island is not susceptible of cultivation; for the\r\nheathy region which constitutes nearly one-third of its surface, and rises\r\nto a height of about 2500 feet above the level of the sea, is extremely\r\nsteep, and too much exposed to winds and rains in summer, to admit of any\r\nkind of cultivation, even that of grain; whilst another not less\r\nconsiderable tract is too rocky and precipitous for that purpose. In the\r\nsouth of the island, the highest limit of cultivation is estimated to be\r\nat a height of 2500 feet, though in several places rye and barley grow at\r\n2800 feet. In the north of the island, where a better system of irrigation\r\nprevails, the extreme boundary of cultivation reaches a higher altitude,\r\nand on the declivities of the Ribeiro Frio, it is met with at an elevation\r\nof above 3000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe earlier history of the island has had such a great influence upon its\r\npresent industrial and social condition, that a few remarks on the most\r\nimportant features of its history may find a place here.\r\n\r\nMadeira was discovered in 1419, by two Portuguese, Joaõ Gonsalvo da\r\nCamara[14] and Tristaõ Teixeira, and, about 1421, a colony of Europeans\r\nsettled on the island. Camara obtained, as a gift for his discovery, the\r\nsouth-eastern, and Teixeira the north-eastern part of the island, together\r\nwith the most extensive powers and privileges. Funchal was then the\r\nprincipal place of Camara's territory, and Machico that of Teixeira's.\r\nThese two recipients (_donatarios_) enjoyed the exclusive privileges of\r\nerecting flour and saw mills; they alone were allowed to build ovens for\r\npublic baking (private baking being permitted to all); they, moreover, had\r\nthe monopoly of trading in salt, had claims upon the tithes of the royal\r\nrevenues, and were empowered to grant portions of the land to settlers.\r\nEvery settler was required to erect within five years a house, a cottage,\r\nor barn, on his ground, and to cultivate the land. If these conditions, at\r\nthe expiration of the fixed period, had not been complied with, the donor\r\nhad the right of granting the land to some one else. These grants were\r\nhereditary, and lapsed to the crown, or the donors, if alive, in the event\r\nof there being no direct successors. Such extraordinary privileges and\r\nimmunities were deemed necessary in order to reconcile the holders with\r\nthe dubious character of the early settlers in the island; for, though in\r\nthose times the highest families in Portugal took part in all adventurous\r\nexpeditions, yet most of the settlers were taken from prison and convict\r\nhulks; and the first settlement of Madeira had much more the character of\r\na place of banishment for criminals than that of a colony of free\r\nemigrants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Vulgarly called Zargo, or the Squinter.]\r\n\r\nWith a view to obtain more ground for cultivation, the first settlers are\r\nsaid to have set on fire so large a portion of the primeval forests, that\r\nthey were soon unable to check the conflagration. According to old\r\nwriters, the fire, particularly in the south of the island, lasted several\r\nyears; and the heat is said to have been so intense, that many persons in\r\norder to escape from it, sought refuge on board the ships in the roads of\r\nFunchal.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The name _Madeira_, signifying in Portuguese \"timber or\r\nwood,\" justifies the statement that the island was at one time richly\r\nwooded.]\r\n\r\nThis act of vandalism against nature, which is confirmed by ancient and\r\nmodern authors, is being avenged even at present, though centuries have\r\npassed since the deed. The cedar, once a denizen of the island, is no\r\nlonger to be found; and only the ceilings of the cathedral and of old\r\nhouses, which are constructed of this costly material, show the magnitude\r\nwhich this noble tree formerly attained in the island. Of the dragon tree\r\n(_Dracæna Draco_), which was once the ornament of the forests of Madeira,\r\nthere are at present, in the whole island, only six or seven specimens in\r\nexistence, which are shown as curiosities to strangers. The Til-tree\r\n(_Oreodaphne f[oe]tens_), the Vinhatico (_Persea indica_), and the Folhado\r\n(_Clethra arborea_), formerly the most numerous representatives of the\r\nnative flora, are likewise at present very rarely to be met with, and\r\ntheir places are occupied by plants and trees of the temperate zone,\r\nparticularly the Spanish chestnut, the fruit of which furnishes the\r\ninhabitants with food, whilst the tree itself has served hitherto in the\r\nnorth of the island as a support to the vine. The destruction of the\r\nforests has, at the same time, considerably contributed to the\r\nmodification of the climate in general, and to the diminution of humidity\r\nin particular. At the date of the discovery of the island, and a long time\r\nafter, the Rio Socorridos, the largest river in the island, is said to\r\nhave been so deep, as to float timber from the interior to the sea; at\r\npresent this river is quite insignificant, and almost dried up.\r\n\r\nThe island remained for two centuries in the possession of the direct\r\nheirs of the original owners, and when at last, from want of legal\r\nsuccessors, these privileges lapsed, the crown granted them to other\r\nfavourites; but with some restrictions. The exclusive right to corn and\r\nsaw mills was then entirely abolished, and the salt monopoly with other\r\nprivileges was retained by the crown. The descendants of the first\r\nsettlers had in the mean time acquired considerable property in land,\r\nwhilst the cultivation of the sugar-cane, now very generally adopted, the\r\nintroduction of negro slaves from Africa, and the foundation of large\r\nestates, contributed materially to the prosperity of the inhabitants. The\r\nruins of many large buildings in various parts of the island are even now\r\nmute witnesses of the opulence of their former occupants.\r\n\r\nThis prosperous state of the island was, however, at the beginning of the\r\nlast century, materially affected by the introduction of the so-called\r\n_vinculos_ or entails, which, introduced under the protection and in\r\nfavour of the church, were a great burden upon the land. Frequently, rich\r\nproprietors left to the church portions of their incomes in order to have\r\nmasses said for the repose of their souls, and encumbered their lands with\r\nso many burdens, that only a small remainder fell to their heirs. So long\r\nas these claims were in existence the proprietors could not grant leases\r\nfor a longer period than four years, nor impose fresh burdens on their\r\nlands. The union of several such vinculos was called a _morgado_ (entailed\r\nproperty). Under the severe but wise administration of the Marquis of\r\nPombal, a law was passed which forbade the future creation of morgados\r\n(unless the property yielded an income of 1200 piastres annually, and even\r\nthen the special licence of the crown had to be obtained), declaring the\r\nwhole system of entails \"as contrary to the rights of property and the\r\nwell-founded claims of the other members of the family.\" The law of Dom\r\nPedro, dated the 4th February, 1802, was still more severe, as it allowed\r\nat the same time the abolition of single entails, the value of which was\r\nbelow 200 Spanish piastres annually, as well as that of every morgado,\r\nthe annual value of which did not exceed the sum of 600 piastres. As,\r\nhowever, a great number of these entails exceed 200 piastres, these\r\noppressive restrictions still weigh upon four-fifths of the land,\r\nnotwithstanding the above-mentioned laws. Among the creditors who still\r\nhave claims, there are three nunneries (which alone, of all other similar\r\ninstitutions, outlived the revolution of 1821), the hospital of Funchal,\r\nand the Portuguese Government. The institution of these vinculos and\r\nmorgados produced a kind of feudal dependency between the cultivator of\r\nthe estates (_caseiro_) and the landlord or holder of the morgado. On the\r\noccasion of his marriage, or the birth of an heir to the latter, the\r\ncaseiro brought presents of such fruits as his land produced; when the\r\nlandlord removed from the town into the country, the caseiro carried his\r\nlitter and luggage; in conversation the caseiro addressed the landlord as\r\n_meu amo_ (my lord). The revolution of 1821 did away with many of these\r\nusages, and in various ways altered the relation between the caseiro and\r\nthe landlord.\r\n\r\nAnother impediment to the improvement of agriculture, is the system of\r\nparcelling ground into small allotments, which has been continued up to\r\nthe present time. The farms are in general extremely small. In the richer\r\nand more fertile parts of the island they rarely exceed an acre in extent,\r\nvery often they are not half so large, and sometimes not even the tenth\r\npart of an acre. The late Conde de Carvalho, the proprietor of nearly\r\none-third of the whole island, had upwards of eight thousand tenants.\r\nSupposing that this mode of farming existed in the remaining two-thirds,\r\nthere would be in Madeira 24,000 farmers, caseiros or tenants; or, taking\r\nthe population at 100,000 souls, nearly every fourth inhabitant would be a\r\ntenant farmer. This state of things is not to be wondered at, considering\r\nthat almost every day-labourer farms a small patch of ground, the extent\r\nof which is not greater than the ordinary size of a large garden bed, on\r\nwhich he grows vegetables, potatoes, figs, peaches, sugar-cane, and\r\nsometimes even grain.\r\n\r\nIn the north and west of the island, where agriculture has made more\r\nprogress than in the south, rent is paid in money; generally, however, the\r\nsystem of paying in kind is still in existence, in which the harvest,\r\n(after deducting the _tithe_, which, at Madeira, belongs to the State and\r\nnot to the church,) is divided between the landlord and the tenants.\r\nAccording to this principle the landlord receives half of the produce of\r\nthe ground, be it grain, sugar-cane, wine, fruit or vegetables, which are\r\nbrought for sale, and not consumed on the farm itself. It sometimes\r\nhappens, however, that the harvest is sold in a lump, while yet on the\r\nground. Oxen are the only animals employed in agriculture. They are\r\ndiminutive and singularly unsightly, but of a very powerful breed, and\r\nfurnish very good meat for the table. They are generally fed in stalls,\r\nbut in the mountainous districts they graze in open pastures. There are\r\nonly a few badly-fed sheep on the island, so that the mutton is almost\r\nunfit for consumption. Pigs and fowls are in abundance, and the rearing of\r\npoultry is generally the principal means of living possessed by the\r\npeasantry. What is asserted by some authors regarding wild rabbits and\r\nboars to be met with on the island, wants confirmation. The few rabbits we\r\nsaw were perfectly identical with the European species (_Lepus\r\ncuniculus_), and lead to the supposition that rabbits as well as pigs, now\r\nfound in a wild state here and there on the island, are only the progeny\r\nof those which have formerly been introduced from Europe.\r\n\r\nThe numerous open and walled water conduits (_levadas_), which are of\r\nconsiderable height, and lead to all parts of the cultivated land, are of\r\nparticular importance. Each levada is placed under the superintendence of\r\na committee, selected mostly from the landowners, who have a direct\r\ninterest in them. Sometimes one person only, generally the most\r\nconsiderable landowner of the district, under the title of _juiz da\r\nlevada_, is entrusted with the control of the water, and receives for his\r\nservices the use of the water during twenty-four hours. The right of using\r\nthese levadas is very strictly guarded, and often leads to law\r\nproceedings. Every piece of ground within a district through which such a\r\nconduit runs, is entitled to the use of the water by turns, during a\r\ncertain number of hours (generally not more than twenty-four). These turns\r\nare different, according to the extent of the district, from fifteen to\r\nforty days. The distribution of the water is entrusted to a so-called\r\n_levadeiro_, who places himself at the upper end of the land through which\r\nthe water is to flow, and with an hour-glass in his hand measures--a\r\nmodern Saturn--the time during which the owner is entitled to the use of\r\nthe beneficent element. After the expiration of the fixed period, the\r\nwater is made to pass on to the ground of another proprietor. These\r\nconduits, so extremely important to the farmer, were constructed partly at\r\nthe expense of the Government, and partly by the contributions of the\r\nlanded proprietors. Those who have no other title may obtain the right to\r\nthis privilege either by purchase or by government grant. For every\r\ntwenty-four hours' use of the levadas 400 reis[16] are paid, which tax is\r\nemployed to keep them in good order.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: 1000 reis or milreis=to one Spanish piastre, or about 4s.\r\n4d.]\r\n\r\nThe high roads of Madeira are, with but few exceptions, in a deplorable\r\ncondition. They are generally laid with small pointed stones, and at\r\nnumerous places they have an inclination of from 23 to 27 degrees. Every\r\nadult male native is obliged to pay annually one Spanish piastre, or to\r\ngive five days' labour for their repair. On account of the bad condition\r\nof the roads in the interior of the island, most of the natural produce is\r\nconveyed from one place to another in boats, or, as is the case with wine,\r\nis carried to the harbour in skins and casks, on the backs of the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER THE RIBEIRO SECO.]\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at cultivation in Madeira was the planting of\r\nsugar-canes, introduced soon after the discovery of the island, through\r\nthe instrumentality of Prince Henry of Portugal (son of John I.), which\r\ngrew so abundantly, that for a considerable period the produce of the\r\nisland sufficed for the supply of the whole kingdom of Portugal. In\r\ncommemoration of this flourishing epoch, as regards the cultivation of the\r\nsugar-cane, two sugar-loaves were introduced into the arms of the island.\r\nIn the year 1452 was erected the first sugar factory, near Machica, and at\r\nthe end of the fifteenth century there existed as many as 120, in which\r\nslaves chiefly were employed. The Jesuit, Antonio Cordeyro, who wrote his\r\n_Historia Insulana Lusitana_ at the beginning of last century, makes\r\nmention of a considerable number of sugar factories, which had been\r\nerected in almost every part of the south coast. On the estate of the\r\nGenoese, Juan Esmeralda, half a league from Ribeiro do Taboa, there were\r\nannually manufactured 20,000 arrobas[17] of sugar. By degrees, however, the\r\nculture of the cane fell, into decay, whether through disease of the plant\r\nor its cheaper production in the Brazils and West Indies is not known, so\r\nthat in the year 1840, only two sugar factories were at work in the whole\r\nisland; and even these only produce molasses and rum, of which the latter,\r\nin the year 1856, amounted to 1500 pipes. The cultivation of the\r\nsugar-cane, however, has increased since the vine disease has fallen so\r\nheavily on the landowner. In the summer of 1857, there were eighteen\r\nfactories again in activity on the island, though so late as 1855, the\r\nimportation of sugar, for the consumption of the island, amounted to but\r\n31,176 arrobas.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: One arroba = 32 arrateles or pounds. One pipe = 108 gallons.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: From 64 lbs. of sugar-cane are obtained 4 galls. of juice,\r\nand from 4 galls. of juice are made 8 galls. of rum. The average price was\r\n2200 reis per gal. of sugar-juice. The rum of commerce (from 22 to 23\r\ndegrees) is sold at one Spanish piastre the gallon.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest elevation at which, in the south of the island, the\r\nsugar-cane can be grown, is, like that of the banana tree, about 1000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. In the north, the cultivation of the cane\r\nwould be remunerative only at those points where, as, for instance, at\r\nFayal and San Jorge, ground and temperature are most favourable for it. To\r\njudge by the soil and climate, the cultivation of the cane in Madeira\r\nmight, with care, even at the present time, prove advantageous. In the\r\nsouth-west part of Lousiana, where, in 1796, this plant was introduced\r\nexclusively for the manufacture of _Taffia_,[19] there exist at present as\r\nmany as 1500 sugar factories, producing annually, on an average, 200,000\r\nhogsheads of sugar. The planter of Madeira is not, as in Lousiana, obliged\r\nby the frost to cut the cane before it is ripe; there it ripens\r\nthoroughly, blooms in January, and is harvested in March.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: A beverage resembling brandy in taste, much liked in the West\r\nIndies.]\r\n\r\nThe motive power of the sugar-mills is mostly water and steam. There are\r\nalso a dozen large distilleries at work, possessing the most modern\r\nEnglish improvements. An acre of land, planted with sugar-cane, is said to\r\nyield from 100 to 120 Spanish piastres, a result for the landowner more\r\nprofitable than that arising from the cultivation of the vine, even in its\r\nbest days.\r\n\r\nAs regards the culture of cotton, for which the climate and soil are\r\npeculiarly suitable, no attempt has as yet been made. The same remark\r\napplies to olive trees; though the Government ordered the latter to be\r\nplanted so long ago as 1768. The cultivation of tobacco, however, is\r\nprevented from extending, being a government monopoly. As for wheat, it\r\nis not produced in sufficient quantity to meet one quarter of the\r\nconsumption of the inhabitants. In the year 1854, wheat, to the amount of\r\n216,918 bushels, was imported from the north of Africa alone, a quantity\r\nnearly twice as great as that which the island produces. Wheat and maize,\r\nor Indian corn, are also imported from the Azores, and some ports of the\r\nMediterranean; an importation which is likely rather to increase than\r\ndecrease.\r\n\r\nThe potato belongs to that small class of vegetables which grow at\r\nconsiderable elevations, and, by proper irrigation and dressing of the\r\nground, three harvests may be obtained in the course of the year.\r\n\r\nThe Inhame [not the Yam (_Dioscorea alata_) of the West Indies and South\r\nAmerica, but a kind of grume (_Colocasia esculenta_)] grows in large\r\nquantities near to rivers and water conduits, where the ground is humid.\r\nIt is much sought for by the people, on account of its cheapness, though\r\nrather a coarse kind of food, which, as Cordeyro naïvely says, \"picao\r\nalgum tanto na garganta\" (scratches the throat).\r\n\r\nSweet potatoes (_Convolvulus edulis_, Lin.), water-melons, gourds, as well\r\nas all kinds of European garden vegetables, are found throughout the year\r\nin the market, though not of a particularly good quality. Oranges, lemons,\r\nbananas, guavas, pine-apples, figs, apricots, and peaches, are abundant\r\nduring the summer season, and on higher ground even apple and pear-trees\r\nare to be met with.\r\n\r\nOn the \"Desertas,\" three uninhabited little islands south-east of\r\nMadeira, and belonging to it, there grows on the rocks the orchilla\r\n(_Rocella tinctoria_), a species of lichen, celebrated for yielding a fine\r\npurple colour, much used in dyeing. Considering the great importance for\r\nindustrial purposes of this lichen, it might, with some care, be\r\nadvantageously grown in Madeira. Formerly there was a small quantity\r\nbrought to market, and sold for 14,000 reis the quintal. At the present\r\ntime the yield has entirely ceased, though it is found in large quantities\r\nin the neighbouring islands. It is considered not to be of such good\r\nquality as that of the Azores, where, as is the case with all lichens,\r\nthat grow in more southern and warmer climates, it is of a better quality,\r\nand more highly esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe product, however, which hitherto has yielded the largest profit to the\r\nnatives, and made the name of Madeira famous and familiar, even to those\r\nwho do not profess a particular interest in the beauties of nature in this\r\nromantic island, is its _wine_. Though this article of exportation has,\r\nthrough the vine disease, entirely lost its former importance, yet it may\r\nbe of some interest to take a glance at its history and culture, in order\r\nthe better to comprehend the magnitude of the calamities that have\r\noverwhelmed the people of Madeira, in consequence of the bad vintages of\r\nthe last seven years.\r\n\r\nThe vine was introduced from Cyprus, almost at the same time with the\r\nsugar-cane, under the auspices of Prince Henry of Portugal, in 1425, but\r\nits culture did not attain much importance till the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century. Some authors even suppose that the wine of Madeira owes\r\nits reputation chiefly to those plants which were, at a much later date,\r\nimported by the Jesuits from Candia. This much is certain, that the\r\nproduce grown on the estates of the Jesuits greatly surpassed in quality\r\nall others in the island, and maintained a higher price in the market even\r\nwhen those estates had changed hands. The grape ripens in the north at an\r\nelevation of 2700 feet, but such as are fitted for the manufacture of\r\nwine, grow only as high as the Curral das Freiras (2080 feet).\r\n\r\nHitherto four sorts of vines have been cultivated in the island, namely,\r\nthe _Bual_ and _Tinta_, both of which were brought from Burgundy, the\r\n_Sercial_ from the Rhine, and the _Malvasia_ or _Malmsey_ from Candia.\r\nThere are four species of the last-mentioned, (_candila_, _roxa_,\r\n_babosa_, and _propea_); the delicious flavour of which by many people is\r\nconsidered to have a great similarity with the Hungarian _Tokayer_. The\r\nmost esteemed sorts were grown west of Funchal, near Cama de Lobos, and\r\nEstreita. Excellent qualities were grown also at Santa Cruz, on the north\r\nside of the island, and the valleys near Ponta da Cruz; in general,\r\nhowever, the grape of the northern district proved to be of inferior\r\nquality, and was therefore only used in the manufacture of rum. In the\r\nnorth the vines were trained on chestnut trees, but in the south, as in\r\nLombardy and the Tyrol, in festoons, supported by a kind of cane (_Arundo\r\nsagittata_), and tied up by a species of willow (_Salex rubra_),\r\nspecially cultivated for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThough nearly a fifth of the cultivated portion of the island was thus\r\nplanted, yet the individual vineyards were but small in extent, the\r\nlargest of them not exceeding three or four acres. In the wine-growing\r\ncountries of Europe fresh plants are set at least every twenty years; but\r\nin Madeira they are allowed to remain in the ground so long as they yield\r\nany fruit. The native growers do not relish improvements; of all the\r\nagricultural implements which some English landowners, settled near\r\nFunchal, wished to introduce, the garden-rake alone was adopted by these\r\nenemies of innovation. The vineyards of Madeira were usually let out to\r\nfarmers (_caseiros_), and rarely cultivated by the proprietors themselves.\r\nThe yield of an acre was estimated at from one to three pipes. In 1848 the\r\ncost of producing a pipe of Madeira amounted to from 12 to 40 Spanish\r\npiastres. In the same year the total production of the island amounted to\r\n30,000 pipes, of which only 10,000 were exported, as the inferior sorts,\r\nnot keeping well, are not suited for the foreign markets. Of the wines\r\nexported, half went to Russia and the Baltic provinces, the other,\r\ncomprising the best kinds, were sent to England, the West Indies, and the\r\nUnited States. Up to the year 1851, when the last good vintage occurred,\r\nthe price of a pipe varied from 12 to 14 Spanish piastres. So late as\r\n1845, when the Danish corvette _Galatea_, on her voyage round the world\r\nfor scientific purposes, put in at this island, the inferior sorts were\r\nso cheap that Captain Steen Bille considered it more profitable to supply\r\nthe crew with wine mixed with water than beer. Since that time prices have\r\nbecome ten times higher, and the best quality now sells for from £110 to\r\n£150 a pipe, and will doubtless rise in proportion as the older stores are\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nThough the yield of the vine had been decreasing, year after year, for a\r\nconsiderable time, yet the actual vine disease only made its appearance in\r\n1852, when the leaves and fruit were covered with a kind of fungus\r\n(_Oïdium Tuckeri_),[20] like a white dust. The Portuguese Government sent a\r\ncommission for the purpose of investigating the causes of the calamity.\r\nThe report[21] is not decisive on the point, whether the fungus is the real\r\ncause or only a symptom of the disease, nor does it offer any advice as to\r\nhow it may be checked. Dr. Hermann Schacht,[22] who resided during a period\r\nof 18 months in the island, and has published a valuable treatise, states\r\nthat the vine-disease appears there in the same form as in Germany, even\r\nas regards the season, which is soon after the blossom disappears. At\r\nfirst the young leaf is covered with a whitish matter, chiefly on its\r\nlower side; it then assumes a crumpled appearance, becomes spotted, and\r\nat last decays. The young diseased grape likewise becomes covered with a\r\nwhite dust, at first partially, and then entirely, the green skin by\r\ndegrees assuming a brown colour, the grape increasing at same time in\r\nsize, until it as large as a currant, or a small cherry, when it becomes\r\nblack, and perishes together with its diseased stock. In this decayed\r\ncondition the grapes remain on the vine till late in the autumn. Dr.\r\nSchacht was successful in arresting the progress of the disease in its\r\nearlier stages, by washing all parts of the plant with a solution\r\nconsisting of one part of glue to sixteen parts of water; an operation\r\nwhich had been likewise performed with good effect in the Royal hothouses\r\nof Sans-souci in Prussia. He rubbed the leaves and grapes infected by the\r\nfungus with this solution, and, where possible, dipped the grapes in it.\r\nThe solution very soon dried, and gave the grapes and leaves a glossy\r\nappearance. All that had once been operated upon in this way remained in a\r\nhealthy condition, and even those affected by the fungus recovered beneath\r\nthe crust, the operation thus seeming to afford a protection against the\r\nfungus. The practice of strewing the plant over with powdered sulphur,\r\nwhich was so much lauded, seems to be of little use. At Teneriffe, Dr.\r\nSchacht found the fungus widely spread, notwithstanding the application of\r\nsulphur. Keeping the grape close upon the ground is also recommended as a\r\nprotection against the disease, having proved very successful in the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Vide Botanical Gazette of 1852, page 9; of 1853, page 583;\r\nand of 1854, page 137;--Fulasne, \"Sur le Champignon, qui cause la Maladie\r\nde la Vigne.\"--_Comptes Rendus_, vol. xxvii. 1853;--Dr. Schacht on\r\nMadeira, pages 52 to 58.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Memoria primero sobre a mangra e doenza das vinhas nas ilhas\r\nda Madeira e Porto Santo, por Joao de Andrade Corvo. Lisbon. 1854.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Madeira und Teneriffa mit ihrer Vegetation, &c. Von Dr. H.\r\nSchacht. Berlin. 1859.]\r\n\r\nThe pecuniary loss sustained since the first appearance of the malady\r\namounted in the autumn of 1852 to 1,137,990 Spanish piastres, £190,000,[23]\r\nand after having waited in vain a period of five years, for a better state\r\nof things, the impoverished landowners entirely gave up cultivating the\r\nvine. A traveller who chances now to visit Madeira can scarcely believe\r\nthat but a few years ago the greater portion of the island was covered\r\nwith the plant. The cause of its disappearance must, however, not be\r\nascribed entirely to the disease, but partly also to the utter neglect of\r\nits culture in favour of that of other products, so much so that of late\r\nit was scarcely possible to procure a sufficient quantity of grapes for\r\ninvalids to whom they were medicinally prescribed. Moreover, the sugar\r\nplantations, which annually increase in extent, have contributed to the\r\ndestruction of the vines, as the former require irrigation, which causes\r\nthe roots of the latter to rot in the humid ground.[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The quantity of wine produced amounted, in the year 1851, to\r\n10,374 pipes; in the following year (1852), only to 1413-1/2 pipes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The vine disease seems, however, to have been already\r\nprevalent in Madeira at a former period. In an old lease, referring to\r\nland or property in the west of the island, there is a clause to the\r\neffect that \"In the event of the young grape being covered with mildew\r\n(_mangra_), the contract would be null and void.\" In Portugal also, the\r\ndisease is said to have existed more than fifty years ago, though not to a\r\ngreat extent.]\r\n\r\nThe present situation of the people of Madeira claims alike the sympathies\r\nof the philanthropist and the attention of the political economist. We\r\nhere behold a population of upwards of a hundred thousand souls, deprived\r\nat once of a product, which has been for more than three centuries the\r\nprincipal means of obtaining their living, and by which many an\r\nindustrious grower made a considerable fortune.\r\n\r\nThe farmer of Madeira, accustomed for generations to this branch of\r\nindustry, is now forced to apply his energies to another, on the fortunate\r\nselection of which will depend his welfare for the future, or at least for\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\nSome of the wealthier growers have not entirely abandoned the culture of\r\nthe vine, and have been assisted in their endeavours by the Consul of the\r\nUnited States in Funchal, the liberal-minded Mr. Marsh; experiments were\r\nmade by engrafting and setting fresh and healthy plants, brought from the\r\nbanks of the Ohio. They proceeded on the principle, that it is most\r\nadvisable, and likely to be productive of the best success, to obtain\r\nyoung plants only from countries where the disease has never appeared. The\r\nchoice fell upon the Isabella and Catawba grapes, which are indigenous to\r\nthe United States; and, whatever may be the final success, the merit of\r\ntransplanting, at a considerable expense, these two North-American grapes\r\nto Madeira, is due to Mr. Marsh. It is, however, a question, whether they\r\nwill be able to replace those hitherto cultivated, the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil being so different. As is well known, none of the\r\nEuropean vines succeed in North America; and the two indigenous sorts,\r\nwhich are grown in great quantities on the banks of the Ohio and the\r\nMissouri, cannot stand a comparison with any of our finer kinds. The juice\r\nof the American grapes is best suited for the manufacture of what is\r\ncalled sparkling hock, which is very like the Austrian Schaumwein.\r\n\r\nSome of the wealthier landowners formed an association for the purpose of\r\nintroducing the culture of cochineal, to supply the place of that of the\r\nvine. Several plantations of nopal, or cactus, were laid out, and the\r\nfirst harvest was gathered in 1858. The nopal (_Opuntia cochinillifera_)\r\nis the only kind of cactus on which the cochineal insect breeds, and the\r\nsouth of the island, up to an elevation of 500 feet, the only part adapted\r\nfor its cultivation. An attempt was made to introduce the culture of\r\ncochineal in the island by Señor Miguel de Carvalho, as far back as 1836.\r\nBut the indifference of the people, and their prejudices against\r\ninnovation, as well as the limited spirit of enterprise possessed by the\r\nnative merchants, rendered the attempt, in that instance, abortive. In\r\nconsequence, however, of the vine disease, the idea of cultivating\r\ncochineal was resumed, without considering, as it would appear, the\r\nprobable results in a mercantile point of view. At the time of our visit\r\nthere were about thirty acres of land planted with cactus, and the \"seed\"\r\nof the cochineal insect was expected from the Canary Islands. One cannot\r\nbut think the notion of substituting the cultivation of cochineal for that\r\nof the vine was not a lucky one, the large capital required, and the\r\nlimited market for the article, holding out small chance of success. The\r\nentire consumption of cochineal in the whole world amounts to no more than\r\nabout 30,000 quintals, and towards this quantity, Guatemala furnishes\r\n15,000, the Canary Islands 6000, Mexico 8000, Java and the Philippine\r\nIslands together 1000 quintals. There is little prospect, therefore, that\r\nthe cochineal culture of Madeira will ever become an important source of\r\ngain, or advantageously compensate for the loss of the vine. Few\r\nlandowners in the island seem to possess sufficient means to withstand the\r\nchances and fluctuations to which its culture is subject. To illustrate\r\nthis, it may be mentioned, that during our visit to the highlands of\r\nGuatemala, in 1854, when the cochineal harvest was bad, the tercio (150\r\nlbs.) of cochineal cost 140 Spanish piastres. In the following year, when\r\nit was unusually productive, the price declined to 80 piastres. A tercio\r\nof dried cochineal costs the grower, or nopalero, about 50 piastres; a\r\nnopal plantation must lie fallow every third year, being consequently only\r\nproductive during two years. Have the landowners of Madeira considered all\r\nthese disadvantages, and will they be able to bear all the drawbacks\r\npeculiar to the culture of cochineal? The climate and soil seem to hold\r\nout far greater advantages for the cultivation of the sugar-cane, coffee,\r\ncotton, and tobacco.\r\n\r\nThere are few spots on the earth's surface which possess a climate so\r\ndelightful, and so little subject to extremes as Madeira, the mean annual\r\ntemperature being 64 degrees Fahrenheit, or only 5 degrees higher than in\r\nthe most southern parts of Europe. The lowest temperature during five\r\nyears' observation was 50 degrees, the highest, 74. An invalid residing at\r\nFunchal, within his own doors, may always have a temperature not lower\r\nthan 64, nor higher than 74 degrees. Violent siroccos occur in the course\r\nof the summer, which drive the thermometer up to 90 degrees in the shade;\r\nthese storms, however, occur only twice or thrice a year, and rarely last\r\nlonger than a couple of days. Dr. Renton, who lived in Madeira from 1825\r\nto 1831, only once during all that time saw the thermometer marking 90\r\ndegrees, two hours after sunset. The rainy season, marked by west and\r\nsouth-west winds, begins at the end of September or the beginning of\r\nOctober. In November the weather clears up, and generally keeps fine till\r\nthe end of December. At this period snow falls on the mountains, and rain\r\nat Funchal, accompanied by north-westerly winds, lasting till about the\r\nend of February, during which time the weather is wet. The remainder of\r\nthe year is comparatively dry, the annual fall of rain at Madeira\r\namounting, according to Sir James Clark,[25] to 36 inches, there being in\r\nall about 73 wet days,[26] whilst at Rome, for instance, it rains, on an\r\naverage, during 117 days, though the amount of rain-fall is only 29\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: On the Sanative Influence of the Climate of Madeira. By Sir\r\nJames Clark. London. 1841.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: The fall of rain, according to Dr. Hoberdon's observations,\r\nis, on a seven years' average, 30·62 inches per annum. Dr. Mittermayr,\r\nfrom Heidelberg, states, on a three years' average, the rainy days to be\r\n95 per year. Johnston, in his Physical Atlas of Natural Phenomena, states\r\nthe fall of rain on an average to be 29·82 inches, and the number of rainy\r\ndays 100 per annum, viz. 48 in the winter, 17 in the spring, 4 in the\r\nsummer, and 31 in the autumn.]\r\n\r\nIn some respects the winter is warmer at Madeira than the summer, owing to\r\nthe north-westerly winds and the regular sea-breezes of that season,\r\nwhich keep the atmosphere continually at an even temperature; and hence\r\nthe island is the favourite resort of consumptive patients during the\r\nwinter season. England, which seems to possess the very unenviable\r\nprivilege of furnishing to the annual mortality in Europe the most\r\nnumerous contingent of phthisical patients, provides this island likewise\r\nwith the greatest number of this, the most to be pitied of all classes of\r\npatients. The climate of Madeira will, however, be of little benefit in\r\nadvanced and decided cases; although it seems to have a curative effect on\r\nyoung people in the first stage of the malady, as well as in cases where,\r\nbeing hereditary, its presence is merely apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe number of strangers who annually, during the winter, resort to Madeira\r\nfor the benefit of their health, amounts to from 400 to 500, and the money\r\nthereby circulated in the island reaches the sum of about £30,000. The\r\nnumber of English alone in the year 1855 was 285. But in the winter of\r\n1856-57, the English invalids who came to Madeira scarcely reached 100.\r\nThe reason of this was another calamity, the cholera, which suddenly made\r\nits appearance in Funchal on the 4th of July, 1856. Until this epoch, the\r\nisland had been spared this devastating scourge of our time. The epidemic\r\nis said to have been introduced by a detachment of Portuguese troops,\r\nwhich shortly before had arrived from Lisbon, where cholera was then\r\nraging. The circumstances under which this epidemic appeared in Madeira\r\nleave little doubt of the correctness of this supposition, and seem to\r\nconfirm the view of Professor Pettenkofer,[27] relative to the importation\r\nof the disease by ships, and its propagation by human excrements, a theory\r\nadvanced by this learned German physician in his famous work, with as much\r\nsoundness as sagacity.\r\n\r\nThe first individuals attacked were four soldiers of the 1st battalion of\r\ninfantry, and the first who fell a victim to the epidemic was a boatman,\r\nwho had landed some of the soldiers from the steamer. He was attacked on\r\nthe 7th of July, at 1 P.M., and nine hours afterwards was a corpse. A few\r\nweeks later the scourge had spread over the whole island, raging with\r\nfatal severity, in consequence of the poverty, distress, and helplessness\r\nof the inhabitants. We cannot forbear mentioning a phenomenon observed at\r\nthe time of the first appearance of the pestilence by Major Dom Pedro de\r\nAzevedo, one of the most distinguished men in Funchal. According to the\r\nobservations regularly made by him, during two years, with reference to\r\nthe quantity of ozone[28] contained in the atmosphere, he found that, as\r\nlong as the pestilence was raging, it scarcely amounted to 2, whilst,\r\nunder normal circumstances, the quantity, according to the ozonometer of\r\nSchönbein, is said to reach 6 to 7.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Dr. Pettenkofer's Investigations and Observations on the\r\nSpread of Cholera. Munich. 1855.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Ozone, or oxygen in an allotropic condition, is found in more\r\nperceptible quantity in pure localities than in those where great\r\nquantities of putrescent substances are accumulated, as the ozone\r\ndisappears by oxidation. Observations on the quantity of ozone contained\r\nin the air during an epidemic are, therefore, of great interest, because\r\nthey may throw a light on the influences of the atmosphere in the\r\npropagation of certain diseases.]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of October the malady gradually began to decrease, the\r\nlast case which happened on the island occurring at Funchal, on the 16th\r\nDecember, 1856. It appears, from official reports, that out of a\r\npopulation of 102,837 souls, 7041 fell victims to the epidemic; other\r\nstatements, that seem not less reliable, even raise the number of fatal\r\ncases to a much larger figure. A variety of local circumstances tended to\r\nheighten the fearful violence of the epidemic: the great distress among\r\nthe people, arising from the deficiency of the vintages during several\r\nyears; the potato disease, which occurred in the summer of 1856, and\r\ndeprived the population, whilst suffering from other calamities, of one of\r\ntheir most important means of sustenance; and finally, to bring\r\nmisfortunes to a climax, even that source of gain was dried up which the\r\npeople derived from the temporary residence of numerous wealthy families.\r\nTerrified by the reports which were in circulation as to the ravages\r\ncaused by the cholera at Madeira, hundreds altered their original plan of\r\npassing the winter there, and even resident strangers, horror-stricken,\r\nleft the island, which had been so suddenly converted from a paradise into\r\na burial-ground. The loss arising from the latter cause is estimated at\r\n£20,000, an immense sum at a time when pestilence and famine were raging\r\nso fiercely. The British Government, as well as English philanthropists in\r\ngeneral, deserve the highest praise for the liberality with which they\r\npromptly and generously hastened to the assistance of the sufferers. Soon\r\nas intelligence of the great distress arrived in London, two steamers of\r\nwar, the _Salamander_ and _Hesper_, with provisions, medicine, clothing,\r\nbedding, and money, were despatched to Funchal, where the former arrived\r\non the 18th and the latter on the 31st of October, 1856. This assistance\r\nessentially contributed to the rapid extinction of the epidemic, as it\r\nsufficed to relieve the more pressing wants.[29] Considerable contributions\r\narrived also from the United States; and, according to public statements,\r\nthe relief that came from foreign countries amounted to £8895.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Old chronicles report that Madeira has been visited by a\r\npestilential disease, that raged within the years 1521 to 1535. But the\r\ncholera was never in the island before the year 1856. The yellow fever is\r\naltogether unknown.]\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the island was, as a matter of course, seriously affected\r\nby such a train of calamities. The principal exports had hitherto\r\nconsisted of wine, cattle, fruit, and wicker-work; the first and most\r\nimportant of these articles--wine--had, as already stated, all but\r\nentirely disappeared from the list for several years, the small quantities\r\nstill exported being merely the remnants of old stocks.\r\n\r\nAccording to custom-house registers, the entire value of the produce\r\nexported in 1851 amounted to £164,960, of which £96,950 were shipped in\r\nEnglish, £26,500 in American, and £16,650 in Portuguese vessels. The\r\nexports of 1855 were only £95,470, and in 1855, when the wine export had\r\nentirely ceased, the value did not exceed £2400!\r\n\r\nThe imports were of a more numerous and varied description; calico, cotton\r\nand woollen goods, hardware, spices and provisions from England; timber,\r\nsalt meat, and other articles from the United States; grain from the\r\nMediterranean and the Black Sea; and sugar, coffee, oil, rice, and other\r\ncolonial produce from Lisbon and the Portuguese settlements. The commerce\r\nis almost entirely in the hands of the English,[30] whose liberality during\r\nthe cholera epidemic has much raised them in the estimation of the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Three-fifths of the 50,000 tons annually imported are\r\n_English_ manufactures.]\r\n\r\nThe absence of a regular banking establishment is much felt by the trading\r\ncommunity, particularly in times of temporary distress. Singularly enough\r\nthere are few Portuguese coins to be met with, and even these are not\r\nliked by the inhabitants. The moneys chiefly in circulation are English\r\nand American gold and silver coins, French five-franc pieces, and Spanish\r\ndollars. The sailing vessels in the roads of Funchal are mostly under\r\nEnglish and American flags. The steamers which keep up the intercourse\r\nbetween Europe and the Brazils call regularly at Funchal for mails and\r\npassengers,[31] and a steam-packet arrives regularly every fortnight on its\r\nway from Europe to South America.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: An English coal depôt has been established in Funchal since\r\n1848.]\r\n\r\nThe trade carried on under ordinary circumstances is, as we have seen, by\r\nno means inconsiderable, and by proper management might enable the people\r\nto extricate themselves from their present depressed position; but though\r\nnot exactly lazy, they are entirely deficient in the energy requisite for\r\neffectively improving their condition. Whenever they have enough of yams\r\nand potatoes, they no longer think of exerting themselves or of acquiring\r\na more comfortable or independent mode of existence. Neither in Ireland,\r\nnor in the Silesian mountains, nor even amongst the Indians in North or\r\nSouth America, have we witnessed such a degree of poverty and wretchedness\r\nas we beheld among the labouring classes in the mountainous districts of\r\nthis island. On entering a village, shoals of haggard-looking beggars\r\ncovered with rags were seen, whose features indicated their unhealthy way\r\nof living, and an utter lack of the most common necessaries of life. The\r\ncalamities of the last five years have certainly contributed to this\r\nexcess of misery, and a traveller who visited Madeira twenty years ago,\r\nmay have carried away with him quite a different impression of its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe race inhabiting the island, notwithstanding some favourable\r\nexceptions, is rather unprepossessing and decrepit, owing to the elements\r\nof which it is composed. The first settlers, as already stated, belonged\r\nby no means to the better classes of Portugal, but consisted of a motley\r\nassemblage of ruffians, who came to the newly-discovered island merely in\r\nsearch of adventure. The admixture which afterwards took place with the\r\nblack race imported from Africa, materially contributed to deteriorate the\r\npeople both physically and morally. Though there is not one single pure\r\nnegro in the whole island, yet the features of a considerable proportion\r\nof the inhabitants denote their African descent. In the population of\r\nPunta da Sol, a village on the west side of the island, the negro type is\r\nsaid to be exhibited in its strongest character.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the native is extremely simple; a pair of white trowsers, a\r\nshirt, and linen jacket, constitute the entire toilette; with a few rare\r\nexceptions we never saw shoes: but even the poorest of the poor wears a\r\ncuriously-shaped small cloth cap (_carapuça_) of a blue colour, with red\r\nlining, terminating in an erect pointed tail, six inches long. This seems\r\nto be a remnant of a turbaned head-dress, worn formerly by the inhabitants\r\nof the African coast, with whom the first settlers, allured by the\r\nslave-trade, once carried on an active intercourse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARAPUÇA, OR CAP WORN BY THE NATIVES OF MADEIRA.]\r\n\r\nMany of the inhabitants of Funchal obtain their livelihood by acting as\r\nguides to strangers. The roads being very steep, and formed of pointed\r\nstones, horses of an excellent breed are used in going even short\r\ndistances; however fast the visitors may gallop, the guide follows the\r\nhorses on foot, to which the natives are habituated from their earliest\r\nyears. This practice is undoubtedly one of the principal causes of\r\nconsumptive complaints, which are more frequently met with here than might\r\nhave been expected considering the climate, though bad nourishment and\r\nunhealthy dwellings may have their part in causing the prevalence of the\r\nmalady. The common people are mostly lodged in small low cabins of wood or\r\ntimber, thatched with straw, the only opening being the door, through\r\nwhich air and light are admitted. Their sleeping-places are wooden\r\nbenches, covered with straw, raised only one or two feet from a ground\r\nwhich, during nine months of the year, is damp.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that the wealthier classes offer a more\r\npleasing aspect. They are extremely obliging, kind, and attentive towards\r\nstrangers, and evidently endeavour to impress the visitor with favourable\r\nideas of themselves and the island. To the hospitality of the Austrian\r\nConsul, as well as to Major P. A. de Azevedo and Don Juan Muniz, so\r\ndeservedly celebrated for his knowledge of the flora of Madeira, the\r\nmembers of the _Novara_ expedition are indebted for many a happy and\r\ndelightful hour.\r\n\r\nThe population is perceptibly on the decrease. The causes are emigration\r\nto the British West Indies, and devastation by the cholera. The number of\r\ninhabitants in the two islands, in 1836, amounted to 115,446; in 1854, to\r\n103,296; and in 1855, to only 102,183. The emigrants during the last\r\ntwenty-five years (1835 to 1860) are said to have amounted to 40,000, many\r\nof whom depart secretly, in order to avoid the heavy emigration tax.\r\n\r\nNumerous benevolent institutions indicate the charitable disposition of\r\nthe inhabitants. The hospital, or Santa Casa de Misericordia, standing in\r\na beautiful square, planted with planes and magnolias, can receive 104\r\npatients, and is exceedingly well managed. It appears, however, rather\r\nsingular that the surgical are separated from the medical cases, whilst no\r\nseparation exists amongst the patients who may happen to be labouring\r\nunder contagious diseases. The most frequently recurring diseases are\r\ncutaneous, a circumstance which need excite no surprise in a country where\r\nthe natives pay so little attention to the cleanliness of their bodies,\r\nand where Government itself favours as it were this carelessness by\r\nlevying a considerable tax upon the importation of soap! Dysentery\r\nprevails throughout the year; intermittent fever and inflammatory diseases\r\noccur more rarely; but apoplectic cases are at times very numerous. The\r\nnominal amount of the funds of the hospital is estimated at £40,000; the\r\nannual income being about £1800 sterling.\r\n\r\nThe hospital for lepers is fitted up for the reception of about forty\r\npatients, most of whom come from places in which the black has least mixed\r\nwith the white race.\r\n\r\nThe workhouse, for 230 paupers, was founded in 1847 by public\r\nsubscription, and has an annual income of from 3000 to 4000 piastres.\r\n\r\nThe nunnery of St. Isabel, for the reception of female orphans, was\r\nerected as early as 1726. Great care is taken of the education of the\r\ninmates, who are not permitted to leave the establishment, except in case\r\nof getting married or respectably employed.\r\n\r\nFoundlings, of whom, in one single year, 839 were maintained by the\r\ncommune of Funchal, are given out to nurse; and there has been a most\r\nsingular expedient adopted, in order to prevent abuse as regards obtaining\r\nthe board money, which amounts to about one piastre a month, for each. A\r\npiece of tape is put round the infant's neck, the two ends of which are\r\nfastened with a lead seal, and stamped, so that, in the event of death, it\r\ncannot be taken off and put on another child's neck. The witnessing of the\r\nprocess of fastening and stamping this necklace is most unpleasant,\r\nalthough no real pain is inflicted on the child.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1855 there existed in the entire island twelve elementary\r\nschools, attended by about 200 scholars, and likewise forty-nine Sunday\r\nschools, having about 2400 pupils. Funchal also possesses a college, with\r\nsix professors and 120 students, an ecclesiastical seminary for\r\ntwenty-four pupils, and a medical school, with four professors, which,\r\nhowever, during the year of our visit, had only seven students. Though the\r\nGovernment is very rigid in exacting the attendance of the children at\r\nschool, yet only about a seventh part of the whole number living in the\r\nisland really avail themselves of the benefit.\r\n\r\nA hospital for the consumptive is now in course of erection, at the\r\nexpense of the Empress dowager of the Brazils, as a memorial of her\r\ndaughter, who, in 1853, died of this disease on the island.\r\n\r\nThere exist several public libraries and book societies at Funchal; and in\r\nseveral of the clubs a great many of the leading English, French, Spanish,\r\nPortuguese, and German journals, are to be found. Four weekly papers, in\r\nthe Portuguese language, are published at Funchal. The first newspaper\r\never published there was the _Patriota Funchalense_, the first number of\r\nwhich appeared on the 2nd of June, 1821.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL OF MADEIRA.]\r\n\r\nThe public buildings offer little to attract notice; the churches are\r\ninsignificant, and even the cathedral, a building in the Basilica style,\r\nis in no way remarkable otherwise than by the innumerable garlands and\r\nnosegays, offerings of pious devotees, which as it were transform its\r\ninterior into a fragrant temple of flowers.\r\n\r\nThat which was once a Jesuit monastery, has been now converted into a\r\nbarrack, in which the whole garrison of the island, amounting to 400 men,\r\nare lodged. The daily pay of these soldiers amounts to 20 reis, or about\r\none penny!\r\n\r\nAn ordinary dwelling-house has lately been converted into a town gaol, in\r\nwhich the prisoners are very humanely treated. Passers-by may have an\r\nundisturbed talk with them through the lattice-work; and once we even\r\nobserved a man who had thrust his foot through the iron bars, in order to\r\nhave his measure taken by one of the inmates for a pair of shoes!\r\n\r\nThe charms of beautiful walks, and a most enchanting neighbourhood,\r\nenhance the pleasantness of the climate of Funchal so much resorted to by\r\ninvalids. In the interior of the town, not far from the sea-shore,\r\nsplendid avenues of magnificent planes, large-flowered magnolias, and\r\nmassive oaks, form delightful promenades, and afford repose and shade on\r\nnumerous seats under the dense foliage of their wide-spreading branches.\r\n\r\nSeated on a gently-ambling steed, one may reach most pleasantly the\r\nsummits of those lofty mountains, which rise close to Funchal, where a\r\nbalmy fragrance perfumes the air, and the eye roams with delight in all\r\ndirections over scenery of the most striking description.\r\n\r\nOne of the favourite points from which such a view may be obtained in all\r\nits beauty, is the terrace in front of the church of Nossa Senhora de\r\nMonte, situated 1965 feet above the level of the sea, on a ridge of the\r\nArrebantao mountain, reached in less than an hour by one or other of the\r\nexisting conveyances; these are either horses, or hammocks and\r\nsedan-chairs, or sledges, covered with tasteful canopies, and drawn by a\r\ncouple of small oxen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLEIGH PARTY IN MADEIRA.]\r\n\r\nThough a vehicle, reminding one so strongly of a northern winter, appears\r\nrather odd in a climate such as that of Madeira, yet its practicability\r\nand convenience is very soon perceived, when comfortably sliding away over\r\nthe smooth stones of Funchal. Wheel carriages, such as used in Europe, are\r\nunknown here.\r\n\r\nBut he who has bodily strength and health enough to be able to wander\r\nthrough the interior of the island, will find spots which command\r\nlandscapes by far more grand and sublime than that seen from Nossa Senhora\r\nde Monte. Cape San Lorenzo, with its petrified fauna;--the awe-inspiring\r\nEntroza pass, that wonderful sculpture of nature which bears so powerful a\r\nwitness to the corroding action of water;--the lovely and solitary cascade\r\nof Rabacal;--the Pic Arrieiro, with its craggy rocks, offering to the\r\ngeologist such a remarkable peep into the geognostical history of the\r\nisland;--the numerous gigantic rocky skeletons of volcanic cones, on which\r\nthe geologist is able to make the most interesting studies and\r\ninvestigations, just in the same manner as the anatomist on a corpse;--all\r\nthese wonders of nature are calculated to awaken the reflection and excite\r\nthe admiration of the beholder.\r\n\r\nThe most delightful event during our stay in the island was an excursion\r\nof several days, made to the romantic localities of the northern coast. A\r\nstately cavalcade of twenty-two horsemen set out, early on a fine June\r\nmorning, from Funchal to Nossa Senhora, and from thence over the Pic\r\nPoizo, through the glens of Metade to St. Anna. After a ride of two hours,\r\nthe Casa de Abrigo was reached, a small house, situated about 4500 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, erected by the Government some years ago for\r\nthe shelter of travellers. From this point the path runs through a hilly\r\ncountry covered with heath, from which the majestic Pico Ruivo, with the\r\nfantastic forms of its rugged volcanic walls bathed in gold by the rays of\r\nthe rising sun, presents a most imposing sight. On the whole route only\r\none small miserable village, called Fayal, was passed, consisting of a few\r\nstraw thatched huts, exhibiting a picture of poverty and wretchedness,\r\nwhich can scarcely be paralleled in any part of the habitable globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VILLAGE OF FAYAL.]\r\n\r\nAt last, after a ride of eight hours, we reached St. Anna, an extensive\r\nvillage, with a large church and some brick buildings prettily situated in\r\nflower-gardens, the most stately of which was--the inn. The good cheer and\r\nrepose found here for a few hours of the night, compensated in some degree\r\nfor the fatigues of the past day, and prepared us for those to be\r\nencountered on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe frequent fogs prevalent in Madeira during the month of June, render it\r\nindispensable to start early in the morning, if the traveller wishes to\r\nenjoy the beauties of the scenery. At 2 A.M., therefore, our cavalcade\r\nset out, followed by a host of boys and porters carrying provisions and\r\ninstruments for observations. Nature was still buried in sleep, the air\r\nquiet and motionless; the full moon, shedding her pallid light over sea\r\nand mountain, feebly shadowed forth the outlines of the hedges and bushes\r\nof roses, fuchsias, and hortensias, that lined the narrow path, and\r\nbrought out dimly in faint relief the ghost-like white figures which,\r\nstanding at the doors of their poor cabins, looked inquisitively at the\r\nriders, that were already so early on their way. The path led up to the\r\nmountains in steep and numerous windings, sometimes on soft ground through\r\nravines, sometimes on solid basalt, or over the uneven surface of\r\nindurated lava. And when at last, emerging from deep glens, steep\r\nprecipices, and rocky walls, all yet buried in the shades of night, the\r\nblue star-spangled sky burst upon us in all its beauty and grandeur, the\r\neffect was almost overpowering. A faint glimmer of light appeared on the\r\ndistant horizon, masses of vapour moved over the ocean, and rising mists\r\ngathering into clouds, undulated like the surface of an agitated sea. It\r\nwas only along the ridges of mountains and through the ravines, that one\r\nmight glance between mist and land down to the calm boundless expanse of\r\nwater at our feet.\r\n\r\nAt 4 o'clock a halt was made near a solitary hut, called Choupana, at a\r\nheight of 4400 feet, when the horsemen dismounted, and left their horses\r\nbehind, preferring to reach on foot the termination of their journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EL HOMEM EM PÉ.]\r\n\r\nWe had just climbed up some steep basalt rock and reached an open spot,\r\nwhen the first rays of the sun tinged the eastern sky. Beaming in all his\r\nmajesty on the sharply-defined clouds that hovered beneath, they sparkled\r\nlike so many ice-capped peaks of Alpine glaciers; and when the great\r\nluminary ascended higher, distributing mingled light and shade in such\r\ngradations of tint as only Nature's cunning hand can mingle, the chaotic\r\nmasses of vapour assumed the appearance of gigantic islands and lofty\r\ntowering mountains, whilst a chorus of feathered songsters rung cheerfully\r\nout from the depths of the wooded valleys. The path wound along a\r\nprecipitous declivity, grown over with tangled Til-trees, past a group of\r\nbasaltic columns, which rose isolated to a height of 40 feet above the\r\nbeautiful grassy carpet that clothes the ground, and in the crevices of\r\nwhich an old laurel, the last of its genus at this height, had taken root.\r\nThe natives call this singularly-shaped group _Homem em pé_, or the man\r\nstanding erect.\r\n\r\nArrived at an open space of meadow ground, the Barreiro, or Encumiada\r\nCaixa, a gigantic rocky ridge, suddenly rises to a prodigious height, from\r\na frightful abyss of almost fathomless depth. We now hastened across a\r\nplain covered with lava, to the rough basaltic summit of the Encumiada\r\nAlta. Safe on an eminence[32] above yawning gulfs, beneath a deep blue sky,\r\nin the brilliancy of a lovely morning sun, we abandoned ourselves to the\r\nthrilling impressions of the magnificent picture which nature here brought\r\nforth of earth, rock, and manifold vegetation. Towards the south an\r\nimmense mountain ridge, with serried peaks (called Torres and Torinhas),\r\nrises to a height of 6000 feet, declining almost imperceptibly on the left\r\nhand, whilst on the right it descends abruptly in terraces, with\r\nperpendicular walls of rocks 1000 feet in height, connected by an\r\ninaccessible ridge with the imposing, stupendous, cupola-shaped summit of\r\nthe Pico Ruivo. All this is disclosed to the eye within a radius of little\r\nmore than two miles. Deep clefts and ravines run from the rocky crevices,\r\nand unite in a gloomy and profound abyss of 3000 feet, which forms the\r\nmouth of the ravine of Ribeiro Secco. Similiar chasms open to the right\r\nand to the left, and when they are too distant to be distinguished by the\r\neye, dark shadows rising on the rocky walls indicate the deep crater-like\r\nbasin of the Curral, and the gulfs of the Metade river, and the Ribeiro\r\nFrio. It would seem as if the whole island has, in a series of fearful\r\nconvulsions, burst from a single central point in all directions; as if\r\nentire mountains had sunk into the deep, or had, by the action of torrents\r\npermeating their crevices, been converted into rubble, and carried as sand\r\nand fragments into the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: 5883 feet, according to the geologist's barometrical\r\nmeasurements.]\r\n\r\nThe summits of the Torres and Torrinhas are nothing but barren naked\r\nrocks,--not a blade of grass, not a shrub, not a trace of vegetation is to\r\nbe seen. At the highest points, strata nearly horizontal extend in\r\nremarkably regular layers, chiefly distinguished by the most manifold\r\nvariety of colours and tints.[33] A dark grey schistus of volcanic ashes\r\nalternates with strongly-marked red, yellow, and violet layers of tufa,\r\ndross, and scoriæ, together with brown and grey conglomerates. Just as red\r\npredominates on the upper part of these _Torres_, green prevails on the\r\nlower. From the spot where the springs first issue out of the crevices of\r\nthe basalt, everything seems covered with a dense green carpet. These are\r\nthe celebrated \"clefts\" of Madeira, in which, even on rocks of 1000 feet\r\nhigh, not an inch is to be discovered bare; they afford a rich harvest to\r\nthe botanist, whilst they fill the spectator with delight and admiration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: The celebrated American geologist, Mr. Dana, mentions that\r\nthese wild contorted masses of mountain reminded him of the crater-walls\r\nof the Kilauea at the Sandwich Islands.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERICA TREES.]\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the scenery of Madeira does not owe its character to\r\nthe grandeur or magnitude of its trees; the peculiar charm of the\r\nlandscape arises more from grasses, ferns, shrubs, and different kinds of\r\nmoss, all of which grow so rank and luxuriant, that the rocks, chasms, and\r\nabysses overgrown with them, appear like so many swelling cushions, or as\r\nif laid with soft velvet carpets in all directions. The different shades\r\nof green indicate the characteristics of successive zones of vegetation.\r\nThrough the lower parts of the valleys run the beds of those mountain\r\nwaters which, though nearly dried up in the summer, swell in the winter\r\ninto torrents. Along these are scattered the straw-thatched huts of the\r\nnatives, surrounded by vineyards and fields planted with rye, barley,\r\npotatoes, yams, and in the lower parts with single bananas. These\r\ncultivated lands rise to a height of 2000 feet, and in many places even to\r\n3000. Wherever on the steep declivities there is the smallest shelf to be\r\nfound, even if only a square yard in size, it is turned to account. Next\r\nto this region, in ascending, is that of the brush and laurel woods.\r\n_Vaccinias_ (blackberries), and different kinds of heath, often attaining\r\na growth of five or six feet, occupy the whole of the ground, and in the\r\nmonth of June, when the broom is in full flower, a bright golden-coloured\r\nbelt girts Madeira, at a height of from 3000 to 4000 feet. We beheld this\r\ngolden girdle in its richest splendour, set off by the dark masses of\r\nevergreens in the clefts. Higher up is the true region of the _Erica\r\narborea_, which, with its light-green and _paille_ tint, contrasted with\r\nthe deeper colour of the laurel, represents the underwood of our secondary\r\nmountain ranges. The _Erica arborea_ attains here the height of a large\r\ntree, and, on some spots, 30 to 40 feet of its gnarled stems stretch along\r\nthe ground. Thus it may be traced, in company with other heaths, to the\r\nsummit of the Pico Ruivo.\r\n\r\nAfter having made some physical observations, and enjoyed a most\r\ndelightful prospect, we re-packed our instruments, filled our boxes and\r\npouches with plants and geological specimens, and prepared for our\r\ndeparture. The guides, despite their heavy burdens, marched steadily on,\r\nhumming in plaintive cadence their native songs. We soon reached our\r\nhorses, and, penetrating through layers of clouds, rapidly descended the\r\nsteep mountain sides to St. Anna.\r\n\r\nA walk on the same evening towards Porto Santo Jorge was not less\r\ncharming than instructive, especially as we gazed on those hardened\r\nstreams of lava, so interesting as regards the geological history of the\r\nisland, out of the numerous crevices of which grew luxuriant magnificent\r\nrosettes of _Sempervivum_. Fuchsias and heliotropes were gathered from the\r\nbushes, and each took a share, now with the geological hammer, now with\r\nthe botanical box, or the butterfly-catcher, in the harvest of objects of\r\nnatural history. We passed in this neighbourhood several houses\r\ndelightfully situated, surrounded by hedgerows of luxuriant shrubs and\r\nsplendid native flowers.\r\n\r\nIn the fine garden of the inn, amidst myrtles, bignonias, euphorbias, and\r\nfuchsias, was a handsome _Camellia japonica_, which had attained the\r\nimposing height of 15 feet, with a diameter of 9 inches, the top spreading\r\nfan-like in numberless branches.\r\n\r\nThe following morning we returned to Funchal, accompanied by a troop of\r\nragged and diseased natives, pertinaciously appealing to our charity.\r\nPlenteous alms were given them, for where Nature is so prodigal of her\r\ngifts, the human mind becomes more sensitive and liberal. At noon, we\r\nagain reached the beautiful terrace of Nossa Senhora de Monte, and here\r\nthe excursion was wound up by a diversion of quite a peculiar character;\r\nfor, instead of returning to Funchal on horseback, we slid down a mountain\r\n1500 feet high, right into the town, on small double-seated wooden\r\nsledges, thus travelling down what is probably the grandest natural\r\n_Montagne Russe_ in the world. A train of more than a dozen sledges\r\nstarted at the same time. These singular vehicles are guided on either\r\nside with admirable adroitness by two natives, who avoid slipping by\r\nmoistening their shoes; and, notwithstanding the velocity of these\r\nconveyances, even slight accidents are unheard of. Sledge parties of this\r\nkind, being cheap, constitute the most favourite amusement of the people\r\nof Funchal.\r\n\r\nThe whole company met together once more at a convivial dinner in the\r\nhotel, where, agreeably to the custom of the country, not only the room\r\nand table, but even every single dish served up, was adorned with garlands\r\nof fragrant flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.--TRACK FROM MADEIRA TO RIO DI JANEIRO.]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th June we again weighed anchor. The intention had originally\r\nbeen to steer direct for Rio de Janeiro; but as we learned, two days\r\nbefore our departure, that the yellow fever, though on the decrease, had\r\nnot yet entirely ceased, we were in no hurry to arrive at the capital of\r\nBrazil, and therefore determined to employ the time so gained, in\r\ninvestigating the nature of the winds and currents prevalent in these\r\nlatitudes. For though the proper course of ships between England and North\r\nAmerica has been admirably laid down, for nearly every month of the year,\r\nby the long-continued ingenious labours of Commander Maury, of the\r\nWashington Observatory, yet there still exists great difficulty in\r\nsteering sailing vessels from Gibraltar or Madeira to South America, by\r\nthe directions hitherto existing; the more so, as the seafarer in these\r\nlatitudes, close to the limits of the north-east trade-wind, generally\r\nfalls in with variable breezes and frequent calms, caused partly by the\r\nAfrican coast and partly by the cluster of isles from the Azores to the\r\nCape Verde Islands, and which are of still more frequent occurrence in the\r\nsummer of the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nWe kept Madeira, or rather the clouds which, during the summer, gather\r\ndaily round the mountains, a long time in view; and on the 19th, at a\r\ndistance of 120 miles from the island, some persons on board thought they\r\ncould still distinguish them.\r\n\r\nWe steered at first in a south-westerly direction, with light breezes and\r\nfine weather. Advancing, however, towards the limits of the trade-winds,\r\nshowers became frequent, and the wind chopped about much oftener; a more\r\nsoutherly course was therefore taken, in order to come as soon as possible\r\nunder the influence of the north-easterly trade-winds.\r\n\r\nThere was now an opportunity of directing attention to the formation of\r\nthe clouds, which, in these latitudes, assume at times very curious\r\nappearances. The _cirri_ disappeared by degrees, and the _cumuli_ towered\r\nup on the horizon in colossal masses. These latter are formed under the\r\ninfluence of the sun, when most powerful, and are therefore seen chiefly\r\nduring the afternoon. As soon as they rise they vanish by absorption, just\r\nas fast as they are formed by evaporation from the sea. Rain very rarely\r\nproceeds from them. The alternation of their shades, tints, and colours,\r\nis beautiful in the extreme, particularly at sunset, when their outlines,\r\nas they stand out in bold relief on the clear blue sky, vary in hue from\r\nthe deepest grey to the most brilliant golden yellow.\r\n\r\nThe nearer the tropics are approached the more does ocean teem with\r\nanimated orgasms. A net cast into it was immediately filled with an\r\nimmense number of little living creatures. Pretty-looking blue cockles,\r\nsea-nettles, and various other inhabitants of the deep, all of the most\r\nminute size, lay rolled up in one lump with small sea-weeds of beautiful\r\nforms and tints, from which those tiny things endeavoured, with great\r\nexertion, to extricate themselves. The microscope discloses to the\r\nobserver an entirely new world in the economy of nature, as displayed in\r\nthe animal life of the surface of the sea. The entire oceanic creation,\r\nfrom the smallest infusoria to the huge whale, are all specially adapted\r\nto the element in which they exist, and organized to contribute to the\r\npreservation, as well as the further development, of the whole globe.\r\n\r\nThis is beautifully illustrated by the operations of the zoophytes; the\r\nwater of rivers dissolves the chalky substances of the land and carries\r\nthem down to the ocean,--immense numbers of these form, for themselves,\r\nhabitations from this matter;--by successive accumulation, produced\r\nthrough the action or the dead bodies of these creatures, the ground is\r\nraised gradually into the reefs, banks, and rocks, so dangerous to\r\nnavigation; or into islands inhabited by man, who, in the development of\r\nhis moral and physical powers, performs his mission in his high position,\r\njust as definitely as the imperceptible animalcuæ do in their narrow\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nExceedingly beautiful in the tropic seas are those small _physali_, a\r\nspecies of _Acalephæ_, known to sailors as \"Portuguese men-of-war.\" They\r\nsail along by means of their large air-bags, exposed to the wind, whilst\r\ntheir numerous long, dark-blue tentacles, like fibres or roots, reach deep\r\ninto the water, extending or contracting in order to secure their food.\r\nThe fringes of these air-bags are of a violet colour, and resemble, when\r\nin sunshine, a splendid flower, floating about the sea in all directions.\r\n\r\nApproaching the zone of the trade-winds, the aspect of the sea is animated\r\nby flying-fish. It has been long a matter of doubt whether this fish\r\nreally moves through the air by flying, or whether, being pursued by\r\nenemies, it merely darts from fear out of the water, and sustains itself\r\nin the air by means of its long pectoral fins, though the long distances\r\nit moves are out of all proportion to its size and probable muscular\r\npower. This doubt seems to have originated with those who never have had\r\nan opportunity of personally observing flying-fish; or who have merely\r\nseen these creatures in the Mediterranean, where they are so small as to\r\nrender it rather difficult to decide in what the movement really consists.\r\n\r\nBut in the tropics all doubt vanishes, for the fish here attains a length\r\nof from 6 to 8 inches, and its pectoral fins are so much developed that\r\nthey may perfectly well be used as wings. By closely observing them, it is\r\nseen that these fins, or wings, have an oscillating or vibratory motion,\r\nlike that of the grasshopper, by which they assist the oblique spring from\r\nthe water, produced by muscular power; they move at a height of from two\r\nto three feet above the surface of the sea, to a distance of from 50 to\r\n100 yards, and at the same time change the direction of their flight in\r\nexactly the same way as grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, to be neither pleasure nor want of food that drives\r\nthese creatures from their own element. They have numerous enemies, of\r\nwhich the principal is the bonita (_Scomber Palamy_); whenever flying-fish\r\nwere seen the bonitas likewise made their appearance; we often saw the\r\nlatter darting out of the water and snapping at a flying-fish, when, if\r\nthey did not succeed, they were perceived hastening under water in the\r\nsame direction that their prey was taking. But the flying-fish is quite\r\naware of the movement of the enemy, and, therefore, sometimes turns back\r\nabruptly, evidently with a view of dodging his pursuer. The advantage of\r\nthe wings is, however, more apparent than real, for whilst they escape by\r\nthese means from the bonitas, dorados, and dolphins, they fall a sacrifice\r\nto the seagulls and man-of-war birds (_Tachypetes aquilus_), which reach\r\nthem like arrows shot from a bow, before they are able to conceal\r\nthemselves again in the ocean. Those which were seen on the north of the\r\nequator, were invariably of the smaller kind (_Exocætus volitans_); whilst\r\nin the south, also, the larger species (_Exocætus exulans_) made their\r\nappearance. They often drop during the night on the decks of small vessels\r\nwith low bows, but on the _Novara_, which rose about 20 feet over the\r\nsurface of the water, this was not possible; however, some fell upon the\r\nchains, which were caught and preserved in alcohol by the zoologists.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th June, at midday, we had arrived in 27° 2' N. Lat., and 24° 7'\r\nW. Long., and lay in a perfect calm, the mirror-like aspect of the sea\r\nallowing us to take a deep-sea sounding with what is called Brooke's\r\napparatus. This consists of a tube, which runs through a thirty-pound\r\nshot, fastened to a thin line. As the shot, however, cannot easily be\r\ndrawn up after the sounding, there is an ingenious mechanism, by means of\r\nwhich, on touching the ground, it is detached from the tube, which may\r\nthen be drawn up, the shot remaining in the sea. The tube has a\r\nfunnel-shaped opening at its lower extremity, by which a portion of the\r\nground may likewise be brought up for scientific examination.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon a boat provided with everything requisite for the\r\nsounding, was launched, and the operation began. Unfortunately there were\r\nonly 4050 fathoms of line, as we did not find at Gibraltar the quality\r\nrequired for the purpose. The whole stock ran entirely out without\r\nreaching ground; we could therefore do nothing more than make the attempt\r\nto heave the tube without the shot. In this, however, we succeeded only in\r\nso far as regarded the first 2000 fathoms; then the line broke, and the\r\nremainder was lost. One of the causes of this accident was the sudden rise\r\nof the trade-wind which increased so much as to engross nearly our entire\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nTo convey an idea of the time a ball of this kind takes to descend through\r\nthe different strata of water, which increases in density in proportion to\r\nthe depth attained, we annex the length of the different periods required\r\nin paying out the line during the experiment:--\r\n\r\n                                                       Minutes. Seconds.\r\n\r\n    The first 1000 fathoms occupied                       19      8\r\n From 1000 to 2000  \"                                     21      3\r\n   \"  2000 to 3000  \"                                     40      6\r\n   \"  3000 to 4000  \"                                     76      6\r\n   \"  4000 to 4050  \"                                      3      5\r\n                                                      ______________\r\n Total time in running out the entire length     Hours 2  39     28\r\n\r\nAs the winding up of the tube requires at least the same period, it may\r\neasily be conceived how great is the expenditure of time necessary for\r\nsuch an experiment, and on what chances the success of the whole operation\r\ndepends. Though this trial was partially unsuccessful, yet so much is\r\ncertain, that at this point, 24,300 feet of line were run off without\r\nreaching the ground. There is always, however, to be taken into\r\nconsideration the under-current, which draws the line out of the\r\nperpendicular, and renders the result of the operation rather doubtful.\r\n\r\nWe now sailed with a fresh and steady trade-wind towards the thirtieth\r\ndegree of W. Long., and thence along that meridian to the southward.\r\n\r\nIn the night, between the 29th to the 30th, we crossed the parallel of the\r\nsun's declination, upon which the direction of our shadows, already for\r\nseveral days scarcely perceptible, was of course changed from north to\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nWe soon crossed the belt of the north-eastern trade-wind, as we made daily\r\nfrom 180 to 200 miles. On the 3rd of July the wind became very unsteady,\r\nand on the 5th, in 8° 30' N. Lat. and 29° 30' W. Long., it entirely left\r\nus. The sky often became dark and threatening; indeed, its aspect changed\r\nat times with surprising rapidity, without any particular disturbance in\r\nthe direction or strength of the wind; nor had we to complain of as much\r\nrain as might have been expected in these regions.\r\n\r\nThe calms in the so-called \"belt of calms\" were fortunately not of long\r\nduration, for in 6° 43' N., and 28° 49' W., a fresh south-east wind sprang\r\nup. When we came within the influence of the south-east trade-wind, we\r\nendeavoured to approach the coast of South America, for the purpose of\r\nobserving the currents in that latitude, this being one of the\r\ninvestigations suggested by the letter of instructions drawn up by\r\nAlexander v. Humboldt. The great oceanic stream, which, on leaving the\r\nwestern coast of Africa takes a westerly direction, is divided by the\r\nprojecting American Continent into two branches, of which the stronger\r\nturns N.W. towards the Caribean Sea, while the weaker moves south-west\r\nalong the coast of Brazil.\r\n\r\nWe had already felt its influence whilst in the zone of calms, and it\r\nbecame still more perceptible the more the equator was approached. The\r\ncontinuance of the south-easterly trade forced us to cross the Line at a\r\nmore westerly point than usual. This, however, causes no disadvantage to a\r\ngood sailing ship; nay, Commander Maury has proved indisputably that ships\r\nmake extremely short passages, which reach the Equator so far to the west\r\nthat they run a risk of hugging the coast too closely. Those on the other\r\nhand, which, from over-anxiety to avoid the current, keep too far to the\r\neast, lose much time, being compelled to pass weeks in the zone of calms,\r\nwhich increases in breadth towards the east, whereas the others come very\r\nlittle in contact with it, and avail themselves of the changes of wind\r\nnear the shore, to double the Cape of St. Roque on the American coast, so\r\nmuch dreaded by the former. We cannot here forbear expressing our high\r\nadmiration of the great merits of Mr. Maury, whose classical work on the\r\nphysical geography of the sea, as well as his inestimable wind and current\r\ncharts, deserve the especial attention of all who navigate these seas.\r\n\r\nThe nearer we approached the Line, the more striking became the aspect of\r\nthe southern constellations. The light of the northern polar star grew\r\nfainter and fainter, its altitude diminished, and it at length entirely\r\ndisappeared. But, on the other hand, the Southern Cross, the Magellan\r\nclouds, the ship Argo on the \"coal-bags,\" or starless, dark spots of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, became more elevated in proportion as the northern\r\nsky moved away, and for a moment we felt some difficulty in recognizing\r\nour old acquaintances of the northern hemisphere in their relation to the\r\nnew stars.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, at 3 A.M., we crossed the Line in 33° 50' W.L. This event,\r\nwhich with all sailors forms a marked epoch in their seafaring life, had\r\nin this case the additional feature of being actually the first occasion\r\nof an Austrian man-of-war entering the southern hemisphere, and our crew,\r\nwho had long before enjoyed, in anticipation, the merriment to which it\r\nwould give occasion, had commenced the ceremony the preceding evening.\r\nNeptune, accompanied by an appropriate retinue of mermaids, tritons, and\r\nnereids, appeared at sunset, to announce with the utmost gravity to the\r\nCommodore, in a set speech, the astounding news that the vessel was\r\nentering his dominions, demonstrating the fact mathematically by an\r\nimmense sextant, a chart, and pair of compasses a yard long, all\r\nmanufactured by the ship's carpenter, and claiming his right to see the\r\nact of shaving and baptizing properly performed on all those who for the\r\nfirst time came into his kingdom. Amidst streams of water from the masts\r\nand fire-engines he made his exit down the rope ladder in a blaze of blue\r\nfire, followed by an ignited tar-barrel, which floated along like a globe\r\nof fire on the mirror-like surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe real farce, however, took place the next afternoon, when Neptune\r\nre-appeared, accompanied this time by his good lady and a hopeful youth,\r\nall decked out in real sea-god-like attire, in a car drawn by six tritons,\r\nstill accompanied by his farcical retinue blowing a flourish on their\r\nbugles, when, after a second set speech to the Commodore, the great ruler\r\nof the waves declared that the ceremony was now to begin.\r\n\r\nEvery sailor was obliged, whether he would or no, to undergo a lathering\r\nwith a nasty mixture of tar and grease, and submit to be scraped by an\r\nimmense tin razor; which operation being performed, the unfortunate\r\nsufferer was thrown into a sail suspended by its four corners, and there\r\ndeluged from head to foot from pails, pumps, hose, pots, dishes, and\r\neverything else that would hold water. The officers and other gentlemen\r\nescaped the ordeal by a contribution in money or wine towards the\r\nfestivities.\r\n\r\nWhen the greater part of the sailors had undergone this process, and the\r\nscene, amidst formidable gushes of water, rioting, uproar, and excitement,\r\nhad reached its highest point, behold! a voice thundered from the\r\nquarter-deck the words \"two o'clock,\" and everything resumed its wonted\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nThough the Line had been crossed at a more westerly point than usual, we\r\nwere able, in the night from the 18th to the 19th of July, to pass\r\neasterly between the rocks Las Roccas and the island of Fernando da\r\nNoronha.[34] On the 20th July we were carried again by unfavourable winds\r\nto a distance of 100 miles from the Brazilian coast, where we parted from\r\nour faithful companion, the _Caroline_. She sailed for Pernambuco, whilst\r\nwe kept out to sea in order to continue the observations on the westerly\r\ncurrents, and be able freely to double Cape St. Augustin. Bad weather,\r\nshowers, and heavy swells prevented complete success in our task; it was,\r\nhowever, ascertained that the current close to the land is not so strong\r\nas at some distance from it, and that the extreme point of divergence is,\r\nat this particular season of the year, somewhat east of the south point of\r\nFernando de Noronha. In the angle formed by the direction of the two\r\ncurrents between the point of division and the land, partial currents\r\n(according to circumstances and the strength of the wind), run towards one\r\nor the other side, of which the stronger tends towards the north-west.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: This island, situated 300 miles from Pernambuco, which\r\nsupplies it with provisions, is at present used by the Brazilian\r\nGovernment as a penal settlement. It is extremely beautiful and fertile,\r\nbut very little cultivated, and admirably suited for a coal depôt, and a\r\nplace for ships obtaining stores, particularly when epidemics are\r\nprevalent in Rio de Janeiro.]\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd July the weather cleared up; we approached the coast and came\r\nin sight of Cape St. Augustin, the first land descried since leaving\r\nMadeira. On the 1st of August a rock was announced ahead; as nothing of\r\nthe kind was indicated in the charts, we were curious to know what this\r\ncould be. A boat was manned, and we were soon made aware, by our olfactory\r\norgans, of the real nature of the object, which turned out to be the\r\ncarcase of a dead whale in a state of putrefaction, over which a number of\r\nbirds were hovering, whilst a troop of sharks feasted on the putrid mass,\r\nboring themselves into the body. This incident shows how many rocks marked\r\nin charts as doubtful may owe their origin to similar circumstances; for,\r\nhad we not been convinced of the real nature of the object, we should have\r\nbelieved this carcase to be a rock, and thus augmented the number of\r\n\"doubtfuls\" and interrogations in the charts of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd August we made Cape Frio, and after a rough and stormy night\r\nreached at last, on the morning of the 5th, the numerous small islands\r\nsituated in front of the harbour of Rio. The _Sugar Loaf_, that remarkable\r\nblack basaltic rock at its entrance, stood grandly forth, as we ran in.\r\nUnfortunately the gloomy state of the atmosphere prevented the enjoyment\r\nof the exquisite beauty of this so often described charming bay.\r\n\r\nHere we found an English, a French, and an American frigate, as also a\r\ndirty old Brazilian sloop of war. Besides these ships of war, a Spanish\r\nfrigate and galliot lay in the mercantile dock for repair; they had\r\nshortly before their arrival lost their masts in a _pampero_,[35] which,\r\nhowever, had borne all the characteristic marks of a cyclone.[36] The\r\noccurrence of tornadoes in the South Atlantic has been so often and so\r\ndecidedly denied, that the mariner does not readily believe the violent\r\nstorms of those latitudes to be hurricanes. This Spanish frigate had\r\naccordingly sailed heedlessly into the storm, and, with only such\r\nprecautions taken as referred to mast and sail, had without further\r\nconcern proceeded on her course. She thus had got into the very heart of\r\nthe cyclone, and escaped entire destruction only by a fortunate chance.\r\nNow, had her commander considered this storm to have been a real hurricane\r\nhe would have undoubtedly steered a different course, and probably in that\r\ncase would have reached the harbour in safety. But the notion of the\r\nnon-existence of hurricanes in these waters is so pertinaciously\r\nmaintained that it was no wonder the careful and able Spanish commander\r\nhad also been misled. Our own opinion is, that any storm in the ocean may\r\nassume a revolving motion, and it is therefore highly advisable always to\r\nbear in mind the well-founded theory of cyclones, in order to act upon it,\r\nas circumstances may require. Were this always done, how many valuable\r\nlives and property might be saved from destruction!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: A squall of wind of the South American Pampas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: The following succinct statement of the characteristics and\r\ngeneral laws of cyclones will be found useful by way of reference:--\r\n\r\n1. It has been fully ascertained that in both hemispheres the air in the\r\ncyclone rotates in a direction _contrary_ to that of the sun. Thus, in the\r\nN. hemisphere, the course of the sun being from E. to S., W., and N., the\r\ncourse of the hurricane is from N. by W., S., and E.; and in the S.\r\nhemisphere, the sun's course being from E. by N., W., and S., the\r\nhurricane runs from N. by E., S., and W.\r\n\r\n2. They originate in the space between the equator and the tropics, near\r\nthe equatorial limit of the trade winds.\r\n\r\n3. There is no instance on record of a hurricane having been encountered\r\non the equator, nor of any one having crossed the Line, although two have\r\nbeen known to be raging at the same time in the same meridian, but on\r\nopposite sides of the equator, and only 10° to 12° apart!\r\n\r\n4. Their movement, which is always oblique from the equator to the poles,\r\nis usually from E. to W. at first, and towards the end W. to E., which is\r\nbut a development of the gyratory motion that forms their most essential\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\n5. The \"motion of translation\" varies from so low as 9 miles an hour to 43\r\nmiles an hour. There is no precise estimate of the velocity of the\r\ngyratory motion.\r\n\r\n6. They are liable to dilate and contract in area, the contraction always\r\nimplying a great accession of violence.

Indeed, we may say that there are few countries,\r\nbeyond the limits of Europe, which in certain parts have already been more\r\nthoroughly explored than the Brazilian Empire, while at the same time it\r\ncan boast the possession of a rich and valuable stock of literature,\r\ntreating of its history, since its discovery by the Portuguese Admiral,\r\nPedro Alvarez Cabral, on the 22nd of April, 1500, down to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAfter so brief a sojourn as ours, we can hardly offer more to the reader\r\nthan a short sketch of our own few experiences, and some remarks regarding\r\nthe alterations which took place in the appearance of the city and in its\r\nsocial and political condition, since the period when Martius and Spix,\r\nRugendas, Prince Neuwied, Helmreichen, Natterer, Pohl, d'Orbigny, Wilkes,\r\nCastelnau, Burmeister, and others visited Brazil, and so accurately\r\ndelineated it both by pen and pencil.[37]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Before we left Europe, the wish was repeatedly expressed to\r\nus that, during our stay in Rio, more accurate information should be\r\nobtained as to the fate of numerous scientific works and collections, by\r\nseveral German naturalists who died in Brazil in recent times, such as\r\nFrederick Sello, Dr. Müller (a companion of Castelnau), Dr. Engler, and\r\nothers. Unfortunately, we can only give the little consolatory\r\nintelligence that, with the exception of the scientific memoranda left\r\nbehind by Dr. Engler, chiefly relating to Itù in the province of St. Paul,\r\nthere was nothing further to be hoped for. The collections have all been\r\ndispersed through want of care, and the manuscripts nearly all destroyed\r\nthrough ignorance of their value.]\r\n\r\nThe magnificent scenery of the Bay of Rio de Janeiro still continues to\r\npossess the same absorbing interest for the new comer, wherever it has not\r\nsuffered by the expansion of the rapidly-increasing city, or the axe of\r\nthe emigrant settler; it is but little one can add to or alter in the\r\npicturesque description which travellers, alive to its natural beauties,\r\nhad already given, half a century ago, of the wonderful haven of the\r\nBrazilian metropolis! Very different, however, is the impression, when the\r\nstranger, on disembarking, sets foot on the new world, and has to make his\r\nway through narrow, steep, filthy streets, greeted by yelling crowds of\r\nblacks and whites, poor negro slaves, and wealthy planters, into the\r\ninterior of this bustling port. An entirely altered state of affairs has\r\nsprung up since the separation of Brazil from Portugal, and he who has not\r\nseen Rio within the last ten years would hardly recognize the capital of\r\nthe Brazilian empire. Along with the most conspicuous deficiencies, in\r\nnumerous particulars, one finds such institutions as are not to be met\r\nwith, in a similarly flourishing condition, in any other State of South\r\nAmerica, or among the republics of the Isthmus. But Brazil is emphatically\r\n\"The Land of Contrasts.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the traveller, stepping on shore from the anchorage for ships of war,\r\n(which is a little to the south of that for merchant vessels), has forced\r\nhis way through the swarms of human beings at the landing stage, and in\r\nfront of the hotel Pharoux, he finds himself on the Largo do Paço, or\r\nPalace Square. Here on his left rises the singular-looking Imperial\r\nResidence, and on his right, close to the shore, the Market Hall. A dense\r\nbustling crowd throngs the streets, while numerous vehicles, some drawn by\r\nhorses, others by mules, as also omnibuses of all colours and dimensions,\r\nand crammed within and without, dash swiftly about, emulating the din and\r\nconfusion of European capitals. Turning now to the right, into the Rua\r\nDireita, and thence a little further into the Rua do Ouvidor, the two most\r\nelegant but none the less most-neglected streets of Rio, there dazzles the\r\neye, in the splendid, richly-decorated shops and arcades, the same profuse\r\nluxury as in Regent Street, or on the Boulevards. But how disagreeable the\r\ncontrast with those cities, presented by the pools of stagnant water,\r\nwhich occur even in the most-frequented streets!\r\n\r\nThe city proper presents the figure of a square of about one mile and\r\nthree quarters each way, between the sea beach and the Campo da Santa\r\nAnna, and is divided with tolerable regularity by narrow streets built at\r\nright angles to each other. Except the most important public buildings,\r\nsuch as the National Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Military\r\nAcademy, the Naval Arsenal, the Custom House, the Market Hall, the\r\nImperial Palace, the Chamber of Deputies, and several of the churches,\r\nonly shops and mercantile counting-houses are to be met with.\r\n\r\nFrom the city stretch the suburbs like long tentacles in every direction,\r\non one side along the beach as far as St. Christoph, the winter palace of\r\nthe emperor, and, in the opposite direction, as far as the charming Cove\r\nof Botafogo, while backwards they extend to the valleys leading to the\r\nCorcovado, to the suburbs of Larangeiras, Catumbý Grande, and in the\r\ndirection of the Tejuca mountains, as far as Engenho Velho, and Andarahý.\r\nElegant little villas, frequently built in the strangest and most\r\n_bizarre_ style of architecture, alternate in these suburbs with ordinary\r\ndwelling-houses, all having most beautifully laid-out gardens. The\r\nmerchant, the manufacturer, in fact every individual in easy\r\ncircumstances, remain in the city only long enough to transact daily\r\nbusiness. Each has his residence in the suburbs, where his family lives,\r\nto whose quiet circle he returns every evening. Among these suburbs, those\r\nof Caminho Novo and Catete, along the road leading to the charming cove of\r\nBotafogo, are more specially the diplomatic quarter, and the residence of\r\nthe moneyed aristocracy of the capital.\r\n\r\nAmid so much that calls for censure in Rio Janeiro, and of which the\r\næsthetic perceptions of the visitor will apprize him in the course of a\r\nstroll in any part of the city, there are two improvements which deserve\r\ngrateful acknowledgment. The first of these consists in the lighting of\r\nthe city by gas (prepared from English coal), which had been introduced\r\nshortly before our arrival, and is now extended to the extreme outskirts\r\nof the suburbs; the second is the magnificent aqueduct, which provides\r\nevery quarter of Rio with a lavish supply of excellent drinking-water.\r\nHowever ugly Rio may look in the daytime, the gas at night gives\r\nit a magnificent and splendid appearance, particularly from the\r\nharbour. When, the evening after our arrival, we gazed out upon the\r\nbrilliantly-illuminated city that lay before us, we could not help\r\nthinking there must be some festive occasion for such a flood of light,\r\nignorant as we then were of what we learned afterwards, that Rio is as\r\nfairy-looking by night as it appears gloomy by day.\r\n\r\nNot less surprising, and forming a strong contrast with the deficiencies\r\nand requirements in other particulars, are the stately fountains that\r\nadorn the squares. Close by the corner of each street, gushes out through\r\nmetal cocks, a stream of clear, fresh spring-water, which has been\r\nconveyed by the great aqueduct a distance of 10 or 12 English miles from\r\nthe slopes of the neighbouring Carioca or Tejuca mountain-chains. The\r\nwater supply has been in existence for 120 years, but the present immense\r\nreservoir and various improvements in it have been introduced by the\r\nBrazilian Government. With the exception of the Croton aqueduct, near New\r\nYork, which supplies that city with 40,000,000 gallons daily, we do not\r\nremember to have seen in any part of the world a similar work of such\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nThe dreary, uncomfortable feeling left by the city, gives way to most\r\nenjoyable impressions so soon as one emerges from the suburbs of Rio, and\r\nseeks compensation for the absence of the appliances of European\r\ncivilization in the eternal grace and majesty of Nature. Walks may be\r\ntaken in every direction, each opening up a fresh point of view, while, if\r\nthe visitor take horse or mule, he may in the course of an hour or two\r\ntransport himself into the very midst of the most extraordinary features\r\nof tropical vegetation.\r\n\r\nAmong the most charming of these is a ride to the rocky peak called\r\nCorcovado, 2300 feet high, the road to which runs through magnificent\r\nshady forests. On the highest pinnacle of this rocky cone, which rises\r\nrather abruptly on the side of the valleys of Clementi and Broca, a\r\nparapet has been erected within these few years, so that the traveller can\r\ngaze over the delightful panorama below with as much, or even more,\r\ncomfort and security, than from the Righi or the great Winterberg in the\r\nSaxon Switzerland. In the south and south-east rise the two stern-looking\r\nmountains, Gavia and Dos Irmaos, both of considerable height, and\r\nencircled by the mirror-like lagoon, Rodrigo das Freitas, near which\r\nstands out, clothed in the most luxuriant verdure, a part of the botanical\r\ngarden; thereafter follows the beautiful valley of Clementi and Broca,\r\nwith the splendid Lunatic Asylum and the fort of Praya Vermelha; beyond\r\nwhich is the smiling cove of Botafogo, and the singular Sugar Loaf, which\r\nforms such a characteristic feature of the entrance of Rio harbour; close\r\nbeside the latter is the fort of San Juan; and lastly, facing the entrance\r\nof the bay, that of Santa Cruz, the strongest in the empire. At our feet\r\nlay stretched out the city itself, with the beautiful valleys of\r\nLarangeiras, Engenho Velho, and Catumbý Grande. On the other side of the\r\nbay, just opposite Rio, is Praya Grande, the capital of the province, and\r\nin the background the lofty, spectre-like mountain-chain of the Organos--\r\nso called from the rocky peaks projecting like so many organ-pipes. What a\r\nwondrous prospect! It is scarcely possible to have, from a single point of\r\nview, a grander or more varied natural picture. We lingered here more\r\nthan an hour, and tore ourselves away with reluctance from all those\r\nglories which Nature has shed with so profuse a hand over this enchanting\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nOne of our companions was the veteran Brazilian naturalist, the venerable\r\nDom Antonio Ildefonso Gomez, who passed several years in Europe when a\r\nyoung man, and had, together with Humboldt, once attended the lectures of\r\nCuvier at Paris. M. Auguste de St. Hilaire, during his visit to Rio, spent\r\nseveral months at Dom Ildefonso's hospitable abode. Although now a\r\nseptuagenarian, the old physician is uncommonly hale in person, full of\r\nhis pristine enthusiasm, indefatigable in the pursuit of knowledge, and\r\nable to pass an entire day on the back of his mule, so that he can ride to\r\nthe most distant consultations without betraying any symptoms of\r\nexhaustion. He had brought with him a number of large oranges, some cheese\r\nand bread, and a bottle of excellent port wine, so that there was no want\r\nof wherewithal to recruit our strength; and there, on the summit of the\r\nCorcovado, our hearts swelling with rapture as the eye ranged over the\r\nmarvellous landscape that lay unrolled at our feet, we drank to the\r\nprosperity of Brazil. Dom Ildefonso, a warm friend to all foreigners,\r\nremarked that within forty years Brazil will probably be more German than\r\nBrazilian or Portuguese, and expressed a hope it might be so, as only by\r\nthat means, so far as his observation went, could his beloved native land\r\nhope for a prosperous future.\r\n\r\nWe returned through most charming forest scenery by way of Larangeiras\r\nand Andarahý. Throughout the entire distance we rode amidst the most\r\nexquisite specimens of tropical vegetation, palms, ebony trees, bignonias,\r\nplantains, mangoes, papayas, and bread-fruit trees, mingling with which we\r\ncould discern the various trees and shrubs of the Northern Hemisphere, and\r\noccasionally strange plants from China, Japan, and Australia, which had\r\nbeen planted here by the enterprising hand of foreign settlers.\r\n\r\nNot less charming is the excursion to the Falls of the Tejuca, to which a\r\nbroad road leads through blooming flower-gardens, and past delicious\r\ncountry seats, extending far into the mountains, and surrounded and\r\novershadowed by a wall as it were of verdure, consisting of the flowers of\r\n_Bignonia bella_, intermingling with the shining leaves of the gigantic\r\n_Bougainvillea_. The coral tree (_Erythrina coralliflora_), the indigenous\r\nmagnolia, the fan-shaped _urania_, numerous species of palms, and lofty,\r\ncarefully-tended screw-pines, plantains with gigantic fruits, bread-fruit\r\ntrees, eugenias, casuarinas, and melon trees--such are the blooming\r\nodoriferous attractions that here adorn garden and field. Ever threading\r\nhis way among such charming plantations, the traveller finally reaches the\r\npath which, hemmed in between two mountain ridges of moderate height,\r\nleads direct to the Tejuca mountains, while to the right branch off\r\nnumerous narrow paths conducting to the various adjoining eminences, from\r\nwhich a view can be obtained of the small cascade. The tropical richness\r\nand profusion of vegetation, has here crowded together upon a few square\r\nfeet of soil hundreds of plants of all kinds. They strike into the soil,\r\nor struggle upwards to the light, or give out roots from the stems or\r\nbranches, and all twine and tangle with each other to such an extent that\r\noften in these tufts and thickets one sees the top of a fern, without\r\nbeing able to distinguish any part of its stem, or a passion-flower\r\nwithout any visible stalk or leaves, all suspended in mid-air, like so\r\nmany elegant festoons.\r\n\r\nA short distance from this singular, thoroughly tropical landscape, is the\r\nsecond, known as the Great Cascade, which, however, owes its special\r\nattractions rather to the character of the surrounding vegetation than to\r\nthe volume of water. The trees here grow on a sort of amphitheatre of\r\nrocks, all of colossal size, and the most widely different forms, no two\r\nof the same species adjoining each other, their stems and branches adorned\r\nwith the most beautiful parasites and the blood-red leaves of innumerable\r\ncreepers, which in their lavish luxuriance now stretch like garlands from\r\ntree to tree, now hang perpendicularly down from the very highest branch\r\nof the tree like a network of green lace, till they sweep along the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe water welling out from the granite rock, rushes into the abyss below\r\nafter traversing a rocky declivity, somewhat resembling a sloping terrace\r\nof about twenty fathoms wide. Its track is indicated by the\r\nirregularly-shaped blocks piled upon each other, some of which at a little\r\ndistance below, their huge wide ridges enclosed by retaining walls, serve\r\nas spots in which to dry in the sun the ripe berries of the coffee plant,\r\nwhich in many parts hereabout forms an almost impervious forest.\r\n\r\nAs we prosecute our wanderings further, we finally emerge upon the green\r\nhills of the vicinity, and obtain a charming glimpse of the ocean; we have\r\nnow arrived in front of the gigantic outline of the Gavia, and directly\r\nfacing us lies the salt-marsh, known as Tejuca-Lake, in the midst of which\r\nrises an island, thickly overgrown with mango-trees, standing on their\r\ndistorted hundredfold roots; melancholy-looking examples of the inactivity\r\nand absence of all attention of the Brazilian authorities, who permit such\r\na hot-bed of poisonous miasma to remain in the immediate vicinity of the\r\ncity, and leave these plants unchecked to carry on their pestiferous vital\r\nprocesses!\r\n\r\nReturning from such a delightful excursion to Rio de Janeiro, the stranger\r\nfeels doubly uncomfortable and lonely in the dreary and sombre city. The\r\nBrazilians are in general neither very social nor hospitable, and only,\r\nafter many years' acquaintance, is a familiar intercourse formed with\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nIn this respect they bear a strong resemblance to the Spanish-Americans,\r\nwhom they also greatly resemble in many of their habits of life.\r\nForeigners settled in Rio spend their evenings generally at their country\r\nseats, some distance from the town, so that the occasional visitor is\r\ndeprived of the social intercourse that might otherwise be so accessible.\r\nWe met with a most hospitable reception at the houses of the Austrian\r\nMinister, Chevalier de Sonnleithner, and our Consul-General, as well as\r\nfrom some German families, and also from the \"Germania,\" a Club founded by\r\ntwelve Germans as far back as 1821. This Society numbers now about 200\r\nmembers, and is well supplied with German newspapers and periodicals,\r\nbesides possessing a well-selected library of several thousand volumes,\r\nand a reading-room, with _restaurant_, smoking, billiard, and\r\ndancing-rooms attached. Of the various nationalities represented at Rio,\r\nthe Germans are the most respected by the Brazilians. They are about 3000\r\nin number, and as the majority are Protestants they have their own church,\r\nfounded by three Germans in 1827, which now numbers 600 members, and has\r\nan annual income of 5000 milreis.[38] The community is under the protection\r\nof the Supreme Ecclesiastical Council in Berlin, and accordingly, as often\r\nas public worship is joined in, prayers are offered up for the King of\r\nPrussia, as head of the church. Despite its existence for more than thirty\r\nyears, the position occupied by the Evangelical church with reference to\r\nthe State, has never been accurately defined, so that differences are\r\nconstantly occurring. In connection with the congregation are a school,\r\nand a society for aiding distressed Germans, which numbers 200 associates,\r\nand has an annual income of from 6000 to 7000 milreis (£600 to £700). The\r\nobjects of the association are the advance of money, pensions, payment of\r\npassage-money for transport, assistance to unemployed or sick German\r\nworkmen, education of orphan children, and so forth. The German choral\r\nunion had given a concert in aid of this humane society, which alone had\r\nrealized 3100 milreis (above £300)!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: One milreis = 1000 reis = about 2_s._ English. The Brazilian\r\nmilreis is of this small value as compared with that of the Portuguese (3\r\nto 7), in consequence of its being represented by paper-money of\r\nfluctuating value, which gradually became so depreciated that Government,\r\nwhen regulating the value in 1846, were not in a position to restore it to\r\nits par value of 3_s._ 4_d._ sterling.]\r\n\r\nIt is not alone, however, as merchants, engineers, and artisans, that the\r\nGermans in Rio occupy a conspicuous position; they likewise contribute\r\ntheir mite to the advancement of art and science. For example, the most\r\nimportant literary enterprise in the empire is in German hands, viz. the\r\nprinting and bookselling business of the brothers Laemmert. Their\r\npublications embrace two hundred and fifty works, chiefly of Portuguese\r\n(not Brazilian) authors, original or translated, treating of Brazilian\r\nlegislation, history, medicine, public instruction, poetry, popular\r\nliterature, works on religion, novels, romances, kalendars, and theatrical\r\npieces. One publication due to the founder of the firm, Mr. C. Laemmert, a\r\nBavarian by birth, has already proved of immense utility, the \"_Almanak\r\nadministrativo, mercantil, e industrial_,\" compiled by himself, first\r\npublished in the year 1843. From a most defective little pamphlet at its\r\nstart, this periodical publication has, in the course of time, become\r\ndeveloped into an elegant, simply-classified octavo volume, 1400 pages\r\nthick, which, compiled carefully and kept constantly corrected to the\r\nlatest moment, despite the most disheartening material difficulties, gives\r\na very interesting insight into the entire internal organization of the\r\nempire, and at the same time supplies the most authentic information as\r\nto the scientific, commercial, and industrial activity of the city and\r\nprovince of Rio. Even more important as a medium for the diffusion of\r\nuseful knowledge among the masses is a sort of popular kalendar, which is\r\npublished in duodecimo form, under the title of \"_Folinhas_\" (Leaves), and\r\nfor 320 reis (about 7-1/2_d._ English), gives upon 360 pages an immense\r\namount of useful information. Of this publication 80,000 copies were sold\r\nthroughout the empire in the year 1857. There are very few works of\r\nimportance written by native authors, as they devote their energies\r\nchiefly to periodical literature. Of daily and monthly publications there\r\nare abundance, both in Rio and in the provinces, but they have only an\r\nephemeral existence. The press enjoys the most unbounded freedom, and\r\nprobably in very few continental cities would such language be tolerated\r\nas that of the _Courier du Brésil_, edited by a French refugee. If the\r\ninfluence of journalism in Brazil is as yet insignificant, it is in\r\nconsequence of the prevailing ignorance, as four-fifths of the population\r\nare unable to read or write, and the papers published are consequently\r\nonly in the hands of the upper classes.\r\n\r\nWhile we found but few opportunities of intercourse with Brazilian\r\nfamilies, the public authorities received and treated us in the most\r\nobliging and distinguished manner. In this respect, we were particularly\r\nindebted to Dr. de Lagos, Dr. Schüch de Capanema, Dr. F. de Paulo Candido,\r\nand Dom M. de Portoalegre.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen took especial pains to make our stay in Rio as instructive\r\nas useful, and likewise gave us in reply to various scientific queries the\r\nmost valuable information and practical hints. Thus, for example, we were\r\nfavoured by Dr. de Lagos with the following particulars respecting the\r\nalleged efficacy of the milky sap of the assacú tree (_Hura\r\nBrasiliensis_), and of the bite of the rattlesnake as antidotes in cases\r\nof _Elephantiasis_, as also regarding the \"Curaré,\" that celebrated poison\r\nwith which the Indians of Brazil tip their arrows.\r\n\r\nThe assacú had long been employed as a remedy for the frightful malady\r\nknown as _Elephantiasis Græcorum_, and its use was occasionally followed\r\nby the happiest results, without any attempt having been made thoroughly\r\nto investigate the specific action of the juice, although, like that of so\r\nmany other Brazilian plants, it would probably surrender, if\r\nscientifically analyzed, the therapeutical energies which enable it to\r\novercome occasionally the most obstinate cases of disease. The assacú is a\r\ntree growing in the northern provinces of Pará, on making an incision into\r\nwhich there exudes a resinous sap, of a brownish or reddish-white colour,\r\nwhich coagulates, and gradually hardens. This inspissated substance is of\r\na dark brown, rather resembling gum than resin, and readily soluble in\r\nwater. When dissolved, it regains the colour and odour of the sap as it\r\nfirst trickles from the tree. A committee of physicians of Pará long ago\r\npresented to the Brazilian Government a memorandum as to the practical\r\nefficacy and peculiarities of the assacú in cases of the above malady,\r\naccording to which it appears, that the symptoms of the patient improve in\r\nthe most marvellous manner from the very first day on which the remedy is\r\nused; the illness seems to be suddenly arrested, or, at all events to make\r\nbut very slight progress. The milky sap is exhibited internally, in the\r\nform of pills, and a decoction of the bark is also administered by way of\r\na beverage for the patient,--externally an infusion of the bark is used\r\nfor bathing purposes. Some of those affected, to whom this remedy was\r\napplied, felt a sensation as of formication, immediately on taking it,\r\nwhile others experienced a feeling as though they had been submitted to a\r\nseries of shocks of electricity, only weaker and more equable.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-established fact that in many parts of South America, a\r\npopular belief prevails that the bite of the deadly _Cobra de cascavel_,\r\nor rattlesnake, heals _Elephantiasis_, or pustular leprosy, in which\r\ndisease, as is well known, the legs and feet of those attacked are covered\r\nwith a scurf resembling the cuticle of the elephant. However, instances of\r\nthe practical application of so terrible a remedy, which seems to be\r\nalmost more dreadful than the disease it professes to cure, are in all\r\nprobability of rare occurrence, and are therefore doubly important when,\r\nas in the case detailed to us, they occurred under the very eyes of a man\r\nof science, and are related by the observer himself.\r\n\r\nA native, named Marianno José Machado, from Rio Pardo, in the province of\r\nsouthern Rio Grande, fifty years of age, had long been afflicted with\r\nmorphea (_Elephantiasis Græcorum_), and had already passed four years in\r\nthe Lazarus Hospital at Rio, when one day, worn out with his loathsome\r\nmalady, he resolved as a last chance of being delivered from his dread\r\ndisease, to submit to the bite of a rattlesnake. All the warnings and\r\nrepresentations of the physicians, who entertained well-founded doubts as\r\nto the remedial efficacy of so dangerous a remedy, were disregarded.\r\nMarianno betook himself to a house in the Rua da Imperatriz, the occupant\r\nof which possessed a living rattlesnake, and there in the presence of\r\nnumerous witnesses declared, signing at the same time a document to the\r\nsame effect, that what he was about to do he did of his own free will,\r\nwithout any influence on the part of strangers, and that he assumed to\r\nhimself the entire responsibility of his own deed. Marianno was of\r\nmiddling stature and athletic build; his entire skin was covered with\r\nrugosities, but without any appearance of ulceration, while his face was\r\nfrightfully disfigured. The points of his fingers, moreover, had entirely\r\nlost their form, the skin readily peeling off from them.\r\n\r\nThe daring sufferer opened the box in which lay the deadly reptile, and\r\nroughly seized it; but it at first attempted to escape, as though it too\r\nwas disgusted at the horrible object before it. When, however, it felt\r\nitself once more squeezed, the snake turned round in self-defence, and bit\r\nthe man on the finger. Marianno was sensible neither of the puncture of\r\nthe teeth, nor of the instantaneous activity of the injected poison, but\r\nit became ere long apparent that he had been bitten, from the blood making\r\nits appearance, coupled with a slight swelling of the hand. Several\r\nphysicians watched by the bedside of the sufferer; almost every half-hour\r\nthe observed results were circumstantially reported. When, however, the\r\nsymptoms rapidly became worse, antidotes were applied, and every effort\r\nmade to save the patient. Nevertheless, the result of the experiment was\r\nas anticipated--within twenty-four hours after the bite of the rattlesnake\r\nMarianno was a corpse.\r\n\r\nSeveral members of the medical society of Vienna laid great stress on our\r\nprocuring a considerable quantity of the celebrated poison, \"_curaré_,\"\r\nused in South America for tipping arrows, with the view of instituting\r\nfresh experiments--similar to those already made, so as to elucidate its\r\nchemical and physiological properties. As the curaré is not to be procured\r\nin Rio, but comes thither from the northern province of Pará, where the\r\nnatives procure it from the sap of the _Strychnos toxifera_, Dr. de Lagos\r\npromised he would take care to procure some, so as to transmit samples\r\ndirect to the Vienna _savans_, and at the same time gave us much\r\ninformation as to the latest researches touching this substance, with\r\nwhose remarkable properties Alexander v. Humboldt had made the scientific\r\nworld acquainted, more than half-a-century previously, in his classic\r\n\"Travels through the Equatorial Countries.\"\r\n\r\nOne special peculiarity of the curaré consists in the fact that, like most\r\nother organic poisons, it is only active when absorbed into the\r\ncirculating system, and proves entirely innoxious, nay in some cases even\r\nbeneficial, when introduced into the body by other means.\r\n\r\nThe more the faculty became acquainted with the terrific activity, and\r\ninvariably fatal results of this poison, the more zealously did science\r\nbestir itself to discover some means of neutralizing the operation of the\r\ncuraré. Quite recently the preparations of iodine-natron, when\r\nadministered in certain proportions, have been recognized as antidotes;\r\ndissolved with the curaré they seem entirely to obviate its evil effects.\r\nCareful observation and a gradual acquaintance with the properties of the\r\ncuraré, have further led to the conclusion that it may be regarded as a\r\nremedy in certain cases, and it has actually been administered with good\r\nresults to animals affected with tetanic convulsions. May it be reserved\r\nto the physicians of our native country, to elicit from the quantity of\r\nthis subtle and singular poison, which they may expect to receive through\r\nthe kindness of Dr. de Lagos, such results as shall make its remedial\r\nproperties available for man, instead of leaving its baleful energies as\r\nat present solely directed to the destruction of organic life!\r\n\r\nIn the company of our Brazilian friends, already mentioned, we also\r\nvisited the most interesting of the public charities and educational\r\ninstitutions of Rio.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a visit we paid to the in part newly-erected Casa de\r\nCorreçâo, which is managed on what is known as the Auburn system, we were\r\nshown three Mozambique negroes, who, in 1852, had been smuggled in a\r\n\"slaver\" from the east coast of Africa into Brazil, there to be sold as\r\nslaves, despite the interdicts against the introduction of slaves, then\r\nactually in force. The vessel was, however, captured by the Brazilian\r\ncruisers, and the negroes forthwith restored to liberty, when, in their\r\nown interest, and with the view of preventing their being a second time\r\nsold into bondage, they were removed to a quarter of the prison away from\r\nthe rest, and specially set apart for what are called \"free Africans,\"\r\nwhere they had been carefully educated and instructed in various\r\nhandicrafts, all at the expense of the State. As a vocabulary of the\r\nidioms spoken by the Mozambique negroes, was an especial desideratum of\r\nthe class of philosophic history in our Imperial Academy of Sciences, and\r\nthere seemed to be but little prospect of our expedition visiting the\r\neastern coast of Africa, we gladly availed ourselves of this unexpected\r\nopportunity to compile the wished-for vocabulary, in which Professor\r\nPortoalegre, Director of the Academy of Fine Arts, materially assisted us.\r\nTwo of these negroes, Camillo and Ventura, were born in Quillimani, and\r\nbelonged to the Mananpi race; the third, Jeremias, was born about sixty\r\ndays' journey from the coast, of the Maqua race, and spoke a dialect of\r\nthe Mozambique idiom. Ventura, a youth of, at the outside, seventeen years\r\nof age, related that he could perfectly remember having been stolen one\r\nnight from his parents in Quillimani, when he was brought to a\r\nslave-dealer named Jones, after which he was shipped off in a wretched\r\nleaky vessel to the coast of Brazil. On our asking these three swarthy\r\nfellow-labourers, hearty of aspect and neatly clothed, who had been so\r\ncarefully tended by the State, and earned, one as a house-servant, the\r\nother two as stonemasons, thirty milreis (£3 3s.) a month, whether they\r\ndid not feel themselves better off in Rio than in their own home,--they,\r\nwith one accord, answered that they longed to return to Quillimani, where\r\nit is hardly requisite to work above six months, and the rest of the year\r\nmay be consumed in a genuine \"_dolce far niente_\" existence, instead of\r\nbeing compelled, as in Rio, to work the whole year round!\r\n\r\nIn spite of long-continued efforts, the vocabulary turned out much less\r\ncomplete than we wished, in consequence of the limited capacity of these\r\nnegroes. We did not content ourselves, however, with merely transcribing\r\nthe answers to our questions, but also endeavoured to obtain a more\r\naccurate idea of the precise meaning attached to each, by repeating each\r\nof the words of the Mozambique language, and translating into it from the\r\nquestions put in Portuguese. This method seemed to be the most effectual\r\nfor ensuring the correctness of the pronunciation, so as to permit of its\r\nbeing afterwards reduced to writing. In the arrangement of the vocabulary,\r\nwe availed ourselves of what is known as Gallatin's method, as it appeared\r\nto us more complete and comprehensive than that sent to our academy by the\r\ncelebrated naturalist and traveller, Dr. Martius, of Munich, with a\r\nrequest that it should have his list of Latin words translated into the\r\nvarious languages hitherto unknown, or such idioms as have been as yet but\r\nlittle examined and investigated.\r\n\r\nThe race, to which these three negroes belonged, seems to have been\r\nalready converted to Christianity. At least, they all had Christian names,\r\nbut could give us no information either as to certain heathenish rites in\r\ntheir own country, or concerning an idol of carved ivory which we showed\r\nthem, brought from the east coast of Africa, and the method of worshipping\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most elegant edifices of Rio Janeiro, worthy indeed of being\r\nplaced side by side with the largest charitable establishments in Europe,\r\nare the immense palace-like Hospital of the Santa Casa da Misericordia, in\r\nwhich between 8000 and 9000 patients are received and treated annually,\r\nand the really splendid Lunatic Asylum (_Asylo dos Alienados_), in the\r\ncove of Botafogo. The latter institution, founded in 1841, which, whether\r\nas regards the tastefulness of its architecture or its munificent\r\nendowment, can hardly be rivalled anywhere, owes its existence to one of\r\nthe most estimable benefactors of his native country, Don José Clemente\r\nPereira, Minister of the Interior at the time of its erection. This\r\ngenial, benevolent soul, deeply acquainted with the human heart and its\r\nweaknesses, hit, as we were told, upon the following eminently original\r\nand ingenious method of raising the sums required. All grades of the\r\nvarious Brazilian orders, as well as the titles of Baron, Count, and\r\nMarquis, were put up for sale at fixed prices, the proceeds resulting\r\nfrom which purposes were applied to the erection and endowment of the\r\nasylum! And thus arose, at the south end of the cove of Botafogo, a\r\nsplendid palatial edifice--a monument less of humanity and love of our\r\nafflicted neighbours, than of the vanity and frailty of poor human nature,\r\nthe tributes to which erected it. Unfortunately, in this establishment,\r\nmere succour is all in all, and the cure seems entirely lost sight of, the\r\nsanative treatment of the patients lagging far behind their careful\r\nsupervision; in short, it being rather a place for the safe confinement\r\nthan the recovery of those deprived of their reason.\r\n\r\nOne of the most instructive examples of how little the inhabitants of Rio\r\nmake use of the natural capabilities of the site of their capital, is\r\nincontestably furnished by a piece of ground immediately adjoining the\r\nLunatic Asylum, which has been dignified with the name of the Botanic\r\nGarden. With the exception of a very fine alley of hundreds of graceful\r\nking-palms (_Oreodoxa regia_), which present a magnificent spectacle,\r\ngrowing as they do with such admirable regularity as to appear rather\r\nartificial columns than planted trees, the eye encounters nothing but\r\nuncultivated land, abounding with the commonest vegetation, alternating\r\nwith badly-selected nursery plantations, although both in the climate and\r\nthe soil every facility is at hand for enabling this garden to be made a\r\nmeans of representing the vegetation of every zone of the globe. Even a\r\nlarge tea plantation, for the cultivation of which 10,000 Chinese were\r\nimported at the cost of Government, and from which, if the experiment had\r\nproved successful, the most important results might have been anticipated,\r\nstood there uncared-for and untended, a melancholy witness of how things\r\nare inaugurated in Brazil, and then suffered to fall through. When we\r\nenquired how long the garden had been laid out, our guide, a witty\r\nPortuguese, replied with a sarcastic smile; \"Since the beginning of the\r\nworld!\" In that part of the garden which adjoins the Lagune, called\r\nRodrigo das Freitas, stands a common mud hovel, with broken windows, and\r\ndoors hanging by the hinges. This was pointed out to us by a labourer as\r\nthe spot at which the Emperor alights and reposes when he visits the\r\nBotanical Garden.\r\n\r\nSingular to say, Brazil possesses no regular university! The jealousy with\r\nwhich any one city invested with certain privileges and prerogatives is\r\nregarded by the rest, is the reason that induced the Government to\r\nseparate the medical and juridical classes, so that each of the four chief\r\ncities of the Empire benefits by the presence of a certain portion of the\r\nstudents. Thus the medical schools are in Rio Janeiro and Bahia, while\r\nthose of jurisprudence are held in St. Paul and Pernambuco. The entire\r\nnumber of students attending these establishments amounted of late years,\r\non an average, to upwards of a thousand. Great prominence has been\r\nassigned by Government, especially of late, to the extension of public\r\ninstruction. In March, 1857, there were throughout Brazil, 2452 schools,\r\n(765 private, and 1687 public,) in which instruction was given to 82,243\r\nchildren of both sexes.[39] A school of industry, having for its object the\r\ninstruction of able-bodied persons, was opened in 1856, and classes for\r\nteaching natural philosophy and political administrative science, are in\r\nprocess of being introduced. Amongst the scientific establishments of the\r\ncountry, the Historico-Geographical Institute occupies the first place,\r\nthe meetings of which are generally attended by the Emperor as honorary\r\npresident. This institution, which occupies in Brazil about the same\r\nposition as the Academy of Sciences in Vienna, directs its special\r\nattention to the publication of old documents and manuscripts relating to\r\nthe history of Brazil and the aboriginal population; but investigations\r\nrelating to natural history are also included in its domain of enquiry.\r\nThe sittings are held every alternate Friday. The naturalists of the\r\n_Novara_ attended one of these meetings, which took place in one of the\r\nwings of the palace. At half-past 6 P.M., the Emperor entered the hall, in\r\nplain clothes, attended by two chamberlains. All the gentlemen present\r\napproached one after the other and respectfully kissed the hand of their\r\nsovereign. On this occasion we remarked that even ladies, when presented\r\nto the head of the State, were accustomed to kiss his hand. The Imperial\r\nHonorary President, whose simple apparel was relieved only by the star of\r\nsome order worn on the breast, took his seat at the upper end of a long,\r\nwide table, covered with green cloth. The associates, with the exception\r\nof the Vice-President and Secretaries, seemed to have no fixed seats, but\r\nsat in the order of their arrival. During the sitting there was the most\r\nmarked absence of ceremony, and the business was transacted in the freest\r\nand easiest manner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Among the higher class of educational institutions, the\r\nCollege of Pedro Segundo ranks foremost, and is at present attended by\r\nabout 900 students.]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings were uninteresting, the greatest portion of the time being\r\noccupied in reading over the minutes of the last sitting, and replying to\r\ncertain strictures upon the incapacity of land-surveyors in Brazil. Sir\r\nRobert Schomburgk had, in one of his works published in 1843, upon the\r\nsubject of New Guinea, made some disparaging observations as to the method\r\nof admeasurement pursued in Brazil, and one member of the society, Dr.\r\nSchüch de Capanema, seemed to consider it his duty in his double capacity\r\nas a Brazilian and an engineer, to protest--somewhat tardily it must be\r\nowned!--against these, according to his opinion, unjust remarks. After the\r\ndiscussion was over, a manuscript was next brought forward concerning some\r\nof the native tribes; His Majesty expressed a wish to have this treatise\r\nread. The secretary accordingly made the attempt, but the writing was so\r\nillegible, that he was obliged to abandon the task. At the conclusion of\r\nthe meeting, which lasted upwards of three hours, His Majesty conversed\r\nvery affably with the Austrian gentlemen, and presented each with a copy\r\nof a national poem, \"Conferaçao dos Tamoyos,\" by a native poet, Gonçalves\r\nde Magalhaes, and recently printed at His Majesty's expense, which relates\r\nthe wars of the Tamoyos with the Portuguese residents of San Vincente--\r\nthe last struggle of that heroic Indian race, the founding of Rio, and the\r\nsubjugation of the entire force, under Nictheroy, by the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThe _Palæstra Scientifica_ is a branch of this institution, the members\r\nbeing chiefly naturalists. The gentlemen of the _Novara_ Expedition were\r\ninvited to one of the meetings, which was inaugurated by the secretary\r\nreading aloud an ancient manuscript upon the natural resources of various\r\nprovinces in Brazil, according to explorations, which had been undertaken\r\nin 1798, by the directions and at the cost of the then Portuguese\r\nGovernment. There was also read a memoir upon the culture of linseed,\r\nformerly carried on in the province of St. Catharina, which, however, is\r\nnow entirely discontinued. Dr. Schüch presented to the Society\r\nvocabularies of the Croado and Puris languages, compiled by M. R. F. de\r\nSenestes, a retired Belgian ship captain, now resident at Minas, who had\r\nlong traded with these two Indian races. Dr. Schüch also exhibited a\r\npigment, or dye-stuff, extracted from the wood of the Ipé-tree, a species\r\nof bignonia, extensively used in the manufacture of axles. State\r\nCouncillor and Senator Candido Baptista de Oliveira, [formerly Minister\r\nand Ambassador at St. Petersburg, and at that time publisher and editor of\r\nthe _Rivista Brasileira_ (Brazilian Review)], brought forward some\r\nmeteorological tables, and explained his new method for measuring\r\naltitudes. The proceedings are usually conducted in the Portuguese\r\nlanguage; but out of courtesy to the foreigners, French was principally\r\nspoken, and the President kindly proposed that Dr. Schüch de Capanema, who\r\nis thoroughly versed in German, should translate into that idiom the\r\nproceedings as carried on in Portuguese. At the close of the sitting, the\r\ncommander of our Expedition and the various members of the scientific\r\ncommission were named associates of the _Palæstra Scientifica_.\r\n\r\nThis society had projected an expedition to explore the western provinces\r\nof the empire, and some of their members were appointed to draw up the\r\nplan for carrying it out. The arrangements for the enterprise were on the\r\ngrandest scale. The requisite books and scientific apparatus were ordered\r\nfrom London, Paris, Vienna, and Berlin. Every branch of science had its\r\nrepresentative,--an astronomer, botanist, zoologist, ethnologist, &c.,\r\nwere to accompany the Expedition; each section had a number of assistants,\r\nthe astronomical as many even as nine. When we arrived in Rio, the printed\r\ninstructions for the use of the members were just being distributed; and\r\nit was asserted that nothing but the non-arrival of the instruments from\r\nEurope prevented the departure of the Expedition. In short, the\r\npreparations which were made in the year 1857, justified the hope that a\r\nmost brilliant success would be the result of an undertaking got up on so\r\nexpensive a scale. The only pity is, that up till now--more than three\r\nyears later--the Expedition has had but little result, and, according to\r\nthe latest intelligence from Rio, some of the members in the north-east of\r\nthe province of Cearà cannot proceed any further for want of money (_por\r\nfalta de dinhero_), and expect new funds in order to continue their\r\nexplorations and their efforts in search of the wild tribes (_em busca das\r\ntribus selvaticas!_) in the interior of Maranhao.\r\n\r\nThere is, generally speaking, in Brazil, as in all other South-American\r\nStates peopled by the Roman race, much of good-will, and still more\r\nvanity, to follow in the wake of northern European civilization in\r\neverything pertaining to progress and investigation; but there is wanting\r\nthat energy, that perseverance so characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon race,\r\nwhich are essential conditions in successfully carrying out any\r\nundertaking, however zealously entered upon. This probably is the reason\r\nwhy in Brazil so many things in science and social life are begun and\r\nnever brought to a conclusion; there is nowhere more talk about _what is\r\nto be done_, than at Rio de Janeiro. Thus, for example, the Museum of\r\nNatural History at the Campo Santa Anna, is an elegant building, with\r\nmagnificent apartments, and large elegantly fitted cases--which, however,\r\ncontain as yet but few objects of natural history, even those being most\r\nunsystematically arranged.\r\n\r\nAnother educational institution--the Military Academy--founded under John\r\nVI., in 1810, for the instruction of the engineers and officers of the\r\nvarious scientific corps, has, since then, undergone nine reforms, and was\r\njust about to undergo another one! In this establishment the highly\r\nobjectionable practice still exists, of making every pupil acquainted with\r\nthe chapter and verse of the subjects of examination twenty-four hours\r\nbefore it takes place.\r\n\r\nThe Public Library, though little more than begun at the period of our\r\nvisit, already comprised 86,000 volumes, and is annually increased by an\r\naddition of five or six hundred. This institution was, in 1856, visited by\r\n3407 readers, who perused 7717 volumes, mostly in Portuguese and French,\r\nconsisting of 238 on theology, 1046 on political economy, 2879 on natural\r\nscience, 153 on the fine arts, 1083 on history, and 2318 on\r\nbelles-lettres, which furnishes a very fair criterion for estimating the\r\neducation of those availing themselves of these advantages.\r\n\r\nAnother institution, which is an evidence of the efforts now making by the\r\nBrazilians to gratify their national vanity, is the _Conservatorio da\r\nMusica_, a newly-established institution for the promotion of the _opera\r\nlyrica nacional_, the number of pupils attending which averages 100. A\r\ncustom has lately prevailed of sending one or two of the most gifted of\r\nthese annually to Europe to complete their musical studies. During a four\r\nyears' residence there, each pupil has a stipend from the Imperial\r\nexchequer of 3000 francs per annum; and in the event of obtaining a prize\r\nabroad, he receives a gratuity of 1000 francs; his compositions, however,\r\nin that case become the property of the parent institution. By this means\r\nthe Brazilians hope to render themselves entirely independent of foreign\r\nmusical talent. \"Why should we annually pay hundreds of thousands of\r\nfrancs to foreign singers and concert-givers?\" said a Brazilian to us one\r\nday in all earnestness. \"We shall soon have our own artists--Brazilian\r\nThalbergs, Grisis, and Lablaches!\" Confessedly the inhabitants of the\r\nUnited States have been vain enough in all conscience; but when we\r\nconsider the wonderful advances made by that active, energetic people, and\r\ncontemplate their surpassing qualities, such a national foible is readily\r\noverlooked. In Brazil, on the contrary, the contempt affected for\r\neverything foreign, the fretful impatience to become emancipated from the\r\nsmallest resemblance to European customs, is exceedingly childish and even\r\nludicrous in a country which can hardly yet be said to be able to stand\r\nalone, since the pressure of circumstances is daily making them more and\r\nmore dependent on other countries, and where it is necessary to import\r\nfrom abroad not merely the evidences of high culture, but the very first\r\nnecessaries of life, even to obtaining supplies of foreign labour. This\r\noverweening self-esteem has rather increased, since it has become the\r\nfashion of young Brazilians, of the better classes, to visit Europe for\r\nthe completion of their studies, as will, perhaps, be best illustrated by\r\nthe following laughable anecdote:--A young Brazilian, the son of a German\r\nfather and a native lady, who had but recently returned from Europe,\r\noverheard one of his friends asking another if he could tell of what\r\ncountry he thought the fresh arrival to be, at the same time indicating\r\nthe youth, who just came from the academy of Freiberg. \"There can be no\r\ndoubt on that point,\" was the reply; \"the blue eyes, light hair, and fair\r\ncomplexion, distinctly indicate that the gentleman is a German.\" \"God\r\nforbid!\" (_Deu m'en guarda!_) exclaimed the young gentleman, who seemed as\r\nit were ashamed of his foreign descent, and to feel even more indignation\r\nthan a full-blood Brazilian at such a mortifying imputation.\r\n\r\nAmong the various institutions recently established in Rio, the\r\nintroduction of which is intended to be made available in promoting the\r\nphysical well-being of the people, the foremost place must indisputably be\r\nassigned to the Board of Health (_Junta Central de Hygiena Publica_). It\r\nowes its origin to the appearance of the yellow fever and the cholera,\r\nwhich had never been known before in the country. The former broke out on\r\nthe 29th December, 1850, having been introduced by vessels that had\r\ncleared from Bahia, at which port it had been raging for some weeks. The\r\nravages of this pestilence were fearful in Rio; out of a population of\r\n250,000 souls, as many as 120,000 were attacked, and upwards of 5000 fell\r\na sacrifice to the disease.\r\n\r\nThe first case of cholera occurred a few years later, on the 15th of July,\r\n1855; and during the months in which it prevailed, nearly the same number\r\n(to be more precise, 4826) of the inhabitants of the capital were carried\r\noff. The fatal cases throughout the empire from this epidemic during the\r\neighteen months between May, 1855, and December, 1856, are said to have\r\namounted to the enormous number of 107,093! Dr. Francisco de Paulo\r\nCandido, one of the most eminent physicians of Rio, and the principal\r\nmember of the Board of Health, states, in a report to the Government,\r\nrelative to the statistics of the cholera throughout the empire, that he\r\nhad observed, during the prevalence of the epidemic, three phenomena,\r\nwhich seemed to stand in a certain relation to its appearance, increase,\r\nand decrease, viz., the almost entire disappearance of the ozon in July\r\nand following months, when the disease was on the _increase_; the gradual\r\nincrease of that atmospheric agent, in proportion to the decrease of the\r\ndisorder; and lastly, the influence exercised by humidity and sudden\r\nchanges in temperature on the intensity of the disease. Dr. Candido has\r\nadded to his highly instructive report some meteorological tables and a\r\ngraphical representation of the presence and absence of ozon in the\r\natmosphere, which will be published, in its proper place, in the medical\r\nsection of the present work.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of the ravages of these two scourges was, that a variety\r\nof other measures for securing the public health were inaugurated by the\r\nnewly-established Board of Health. Among others, a hospital was set on\r\nfoot in a charming part of the Cove of Jurujuba,[40] at the eastern\r\nextremity of the Bay of Rio, expressly for the reception of patients\r\nafflicted with yellow fever or cholera. Every morning since that attack,\r\n(and during the unhealthy season several times a day), a small Government\r\nsteamer, fitted up for the purpose, plies round the bay, to take up any\r\ncases that may happen to occur on board the ships arriving, and convey\r\nthem hither free of charge. Two medical men on board the steamer commence\r\nthe treatment, by applying the necessary remedies, during the passage\r\nfrom the ship to the hospital. Any vessel at anchor in the bay with an\r\nepidemic on board, has, according to arrangement, simply to hoist a flag\r\non the mainmast, whereupon the Government steamer immediately embarks the\r\nsick persons. In order more effectually to keep from all contact with the\r\npopulation of the town, such shipboard patients as are labouring under\r\ninfectious complaints, another hospital has been established on the Island\r\nof Marica, situated beyond the bar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Pronounced Shooru-shooba.]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these recent epidemic attacks, much greater attention\r\nthan formerly has of late been paid to the cleanliness of the capital of\r\nthe Brazilian empire, though a great deal has yet to be done in this\r\nrespect. Rio used to be, without exception, the dirtiest city in the\r\nworld. As there were neither gutters nor sewers, all impurities\r\naccumulated during the twenty-four hours used, towards evening, to be\r\ncarried by negroes on their heads, in pails and casks, to the bay, and,\r\nsingularly enough, emptied in the immediate vicinity of the Imperial\r\npalace, whereby several quarters of the city, particularly in the hot\r\nseason, were rendered entirely uninhabitable. The execution of proper\r\ndrainage and sewerage works in a city such as Rio, which lies on a flat\r\nand is densely built near the water, must be at all times attended with a\r\nvery large expenditure of money. But who would boggle at any amount for an\r\nobject which concerns the bodily health, not merely of the present, but of\r\nall succeeding generations? At the period of our visit, the Government had\r\nentered into a contract with Messrs. Joaquim Pereira de Lima and J. F.\r\nRussell, by which, in consideration of a lease for ninety years of\r\ncertain taxes specially levied, the two contractors have undertaken to\r\nintroduce into the capital of Brazil a system of harbour and street\r\npurification, similar to that which has long been in general use\r\nthroughout England. There had also been lately started a _Companhia\r\nReformadora_, having for object the widening and beautifying of certain\r\nstreets, and the improvement of the paving. One must have lived in Rio,\r\nwhere each street and open square is a hotbed of fever and sickness, to be\r\nable aright to estimate the importance of the two last-named associations.\r\n\r\nA war steamer was, by the command of H.M. the Emperor of Brazil, placed at\r\nour disposal, to afford us an opportunity of viewing more closely the most\r\nbeautiful points in the magnificent bay of Rio. There were on board with\r\nus the Captain of the Port, Dom Francisco de Perura Pinto, the captains of\r\nthe Brazilian men-of-war lying in the harbour, as also several members of\r\nthe Historico-Geographical Institute. A military band enlivened the party\r\nby playing national airs during the day. We first visited the south-east\r\npart of the bay at the villages of San Domingo and Ponta da Armacao,\r\nopposite to Ponta da Aréa, whence steamers, for navigating the bay and\r\nadjoining coast, are run by an English company, which employs 667 hands,\r\n(of whom 298 are foreigners, 207 natives, and 162 negro slaves). Except a\r\npart of the funds advanced by native capitalists, the whole undertaking is\r\ncarried out by foreigners. England furnishes the engineers and machinery,\r\nwhilst the requisite timber is brought from Norway and North America. The\r\nvalue of the labour employed during 1856 amounted to nearly £90,000.--We\r\nproceeded hence past the islands of Salinas and Honorio, and between the\r\nisland of Baretto and the eastern shore of the bay, as far as the\r\nluxuriant island of Paquetá, on the lovely shores of which we landed. It\r\nhas a circumference of five miles, and is inhabited by 16,000 persons, who\r\nconvert shells into chalk; nearly all the houses on shore are chalk-kilns.\r\nDuring the dry season this island is the favourite Sunday resort of the\r\n_fluminenses_, as the Rio de Janeirians delight to call themselves. From\r\nthis sweet spot the steamer carried us to the north side of the bay. In\r\nthe back-ground, the Organos mountains now appeared in all the majesty of\r\ntheir imposing outline, whilst on one of the projecting ridges, the church\r\nSan Francisco de Croara forms an extremely picturesque object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISLAND OF PAQUITÀ, BAY OF RIO.]\r\n\r\nThe more the northern portion of the bay is approached, the more romantic\r\nbecomes the panorama of the mountains: from this point stand out in their\r\nfull grandeur the Serra da Estrella, the Serra da Tinguá (which is\r\ncurrently believed to be the highest mountain, not merely on the bay, but\r\nin Brazil), then the deep valley of Santa Cruz, next to which the\r\nmountain-chains of Suaratyba, and the Serra de Iguassoú, rise\r\nmajestically, melting away into the charming Tejuca chain, the Gavia, and\r\nthe world-renowned Corcovado, whilst the Sugar Loaf, that gigantic\r\nguardian at the entrance of the harbour, splendidly terminates this\r\nmagnificent amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nWe passed the largest of the islands in the bay, the Ilha do Governador,\r\nwhich has a circumference of upwards of seven miles, and is inhabited by\r\nabout a hundred persons chiefly employed in the chalk-kilns, sail-cloth\r\nand soap manufactories; and touched at some wild spots that promised a\r\nharvest for our naturalists. Here and there, from the deep blue waters,\r\nsprang up islands of the most luxuriant vegetation, like tropical idylls\r\nof rock and forest, such as the eye marvels to rest upon, but the pen\r\nrefuses to describe. Indelibly impressed on our minds remains in this\r\nrespect the lovely islet of Catalán, with its beautiful flowers and palms.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the capital, towards the east of the bay, passing the\r\nisland Bom Jesus, with a magnificent Franciscan monastery, and the Ponta\r\ndo Cajù, with charming country seats, a forest of masts, strikes the eye\r\nin bold contrast with the Sugar Loaf in the east, and the Morro de Viracao\r\nand the fort Pico in the west, which covers the position of Santa Cruz.\r\nUnfortunately we went down, just at this point, to a splendid banquet,\r\netiquette requiring that we should exchange the quarter-deck for the\r\nstate-room; for in Brazil also, upon such occasions, meals and\r\nspeechifying play an important part, and greatly prejudice the special\r\nobject of travel--the enjoyment of nature.\r\n\r\nWe were not yet done, however, with our excursion. Again we turned towards\r\nthe beautiful Cove of Jurujuba, where on the shore lay pretty little\r\ncottages embowered in the richest foliage, while, through a deep\r\ndepression, appeared the masts of ships which were still on the bosom of\r\nthe ocean outside, on the point of entering the harbour. As the vessel\r\nsteamed in, the scenery changed character at every moment, like a fairy\r\nlandscape, full of the loveliest, most enchanting glimpses of the\r\nsurrounding country. At Jurujuba, we landed to visit the _Hospital\r\nMaritimo de S. Isabel_, erected in 1853, for the reception of sailors in\r\nill-health of all nations and creeds. It proved of immense utility during\r\nthe prevalence of epidemics. In the five years of its existence at the\r\nperiod of our visit, there had been admitted nearly 6000 cases of yellow\r\nfever.[41] For the excellent management of this fine hospital the utmost\r\ncredit is due to the physicians in charge, Dr. Bento Maria da Costa, and\r\nDr. José Teixeira da Souza.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: In the year 1856, 2452 patients were received into the\r\nhospital at Jurujuba Cove, of whom 175 died, 2195 were dismissed cured,\r\nand 82 remained under treatment. By comparison with former years, the\r\nnumber of sick seemed to have fallen off 13 per cent., while the expenses\r\nof management had increased 9 per cent.]\r\n\r\nThe ground immediately surrounding the hospital has been reclaimed by the\r\nhand of man, and transformed into a garden, in which flourish, in\r\nsolitary majesty, the shady _Aleurites triloba_ and the _Anda Gomesii_,\r\ngrowing in avenues or other regular groups, after all wild vegetation had\r\nbeen cut down. But at the first step beyond, the foot of the wanderer\r\nthrough these solitudes strikes into paths leading through the richest,\r\ndensest forest scenery Casuarinas (_Anacardium occidentale_), with its\r\nluscious pear-shaped fruits, the Indian mango-tree, the various species of\r\nEugenia, so rich in ethereal oil, the Figuera Branca (_ficus doliaria_),\r\nthe canoe-tree, a gigantic species of _Bombax_, protected by sharp spines,\r\nand other lofty forest-children, reach to the very buildings; while, amid\r\nthe dense underwood that grows unchecked, and a few paces distant only\r\nfrom the dwellings of man, lurk dangerously poisonous snakes, who find\r\nhere a secure haunt. Within our own experience, as one of the botanists of\r\nthe Expedition was placing a ladder against a primæval forest tree, the\r\nprogenitor of numberless scions, he stumbled upon a poisonous Jacaraca,\r\nready to defend from intrusion his accustomed resting-place.\r\n\r\nAt the north-west entrance of Jurujuba Cove, rises a lofty island, with\r\nthe appropriate name of Bom Viajem (\"a happy voyage\"), with its church of\r\nthe Virgin of the same name, situate on the extreme summit, 400 feet in\r\nheight. As, during our visit to the hospital, the twilight had crept\r\nstealthily on, we returned without further stoppage to Rio; when the\r\ncompany, landing at the usual landing-place of the arsenal, separated,\r\nfull of the most pleasing impressions, arising from the beautiful scenery\r\nenjoyed during the day, and a deep sense of gratitude for the noble\r\nhospitality shown us by our amiable hosts.\r\n\r\nAnother favour was conferred by Drs. de Lagos and Schüch, who formed a\r\nfishing-party on a grand scale, which was greatly enjoyed by all, though\r\nthe gun proved more profitable to our naturalists than rod, line, or net.\r\n\r\nAs the number of days at our disposal in Rio Janeiro began to diminish, we\r\napplied ourselves to seeing the utmost possible with the smallest\r\nsacrifice of time. The morning after our excursion on board the Santa\r\nCruz, we attended a sitting of the Chamber of Deputies. The hall, oval in\r\nshape, is plainly, but comfortably fitted up. The members sit on benches\r\nin a semicircle. Opposite the president stand tables for the ministers of\r\nstate; at the upper and lower end of the hall are galleries for the\r\npublic, and one is specially assigned to the diplomatic body. Each member\r\nspeaks from his place. Their language is very free and their behaviour\r\nstill more so,--they sometimes carry this so far as not to allow a speaker\r\nto proceed; and in screaming, brawling, and violence, they excel even\r\ncertain members of the late French Chamber of Deputies. There are said to\r\nbe some very able speakers amongst the Brazilians. The subject of debate\r\nwas a petition presented to the House for an inquiry into the conduct of a\r\nlate minister of justice, who was accused of having tyrannically dismissed\r\na government officer in the province of Maranhao. The subject had created\r\ngreat interest in the public mind, and the galleries were crowded to\r\nsuffocation; we did not remain till the conclusion of the debate, but the\r\nminister is said to have justified the proceeding by proving that the\r\nofficer had allowed himself to be bribed.\r\n\r\nOn the same day we made an excursion to the Serra da Estrella and\r\nPetropolis, a place which has of late excited so much attention in the\r\npublic journals, since the question of German emigration to Brazil, with\r\nits accompaniments of agitations by the Brazilian recruiting agents, began\r\nto assume its present remarkable proportions. Though the distance from Rio\r\nto Petropolis may be accomplished in four hours, yet three different\r\nvehicles are required:--in the first place, a steamer from Rio to the\r\nrailway-station on the opposite side of the bay, then the railway to\r\nFragosa, and lastly, a carriage to the final destination over an excellent\r\nroad which runs through the mountains to Petropolis.\r\n\r\nThis fine work, which was opened in 1848, is unfortunately the only one of\r\nits kind in the whole empire,[42] as are likewise the five miles of\r\nrailway between Mauá and Fragosa; and yet how highly important would\r\nrailway communication prove from the metropolis to the northern provinces,\r\nby means of which the excessive cost of carriage by mules might be so\r\nconsiderably reduced, benefiting alike the landowner and the merchant! As\r\nan illustration, the fact may be mentioned, that the cost of transit for\r\nan arroba (32 lbs.) of coffee from the coffee district of Vassouras to\r\nRio, a distance of about 50 miles, amounts to from 700 to 800 reis (about\r\n1_s._ 8_d._). The trouble and expense connected with this miserable mode\r\nof conveyance, so much enhance the price of some kinds of natural produce,\r\nthat it does not pay to transport them to the harbour of the capital.\r\nSeveral companies have latterly been projected, and money subscribed for\r\nconstructing railways in the various provinces of the empire, and a few of\r\nthese are already under weigh, as, for example, that of Dom Pedro Segundo,\r\nwhich will put the richest provinces in direct communication with Rio, and\r\nfor which the amount of money required has been entirely subscribed. But\r\nin this, as in all other Brazilian enterprises, energy is wanting to make\r\nthese good intentions bear fruit; and so long as there is not a greater\r\nadmixture of foreign go-a-head-ativeness in the country, much must remain\r\nconfined to the mere expression of patriotic wishes. And in this\r\nconnection, foreign immigration, of which we shall treat further on, will\r\nprove of immense importance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: This road is to be continued from Petropolis as far as\r\nParahyba; and in various other directions also the building of roads for\r\ncommercial traffic is being fostered by Government. The Brazilian\r\nGovernment are at the same time turning their attention to improving the\r\nexisting means of transport by importing dromedaries for use. As it\r\nwithstands variation of temperature, and thrives on almost any kind of\r\nnourishment, the dromedary is certain to do well, especially in the\r\nnorthern provinces, and will prove exceedingly serviceable in the\r\ntransport of the products of that section of the country. The great heat\r\nand drought which prevail in Maranhao, Piauhy, Matto Grosso, and that\r\ndirection generally, is eminently suitable to the dromedary, which does\r\nnot thrive in hot _damp_ weather. It is calculated that a dromedary, which\r\ncan carry an average weight of 700 pounds, (being six times what a horse,\r\nand four times what a mule will carry on his back), costs, in his own\r\ncountry, from £12 to £16; and after paying cost of transport to Brazil,\r\nwill be worth £48. With the introduction of the \"ship of the desert,\" that\r\nof the date-palm must go hand in hand, as that fruit constitutes the chief\r\nfood of the dromedary, and will probably simultaneously effect a great\r\nchange in the articles of consumption by the lower orders.]\r\n\r\nThe journey by carriage through the Sierra from Fragosa to Petropolis is\r\nextremely beautiful. He who is not fortunate enough to enter deeper into\r\nthe interior, at least obtains here an idea of what constitutes a primæval\r\nBrazilian forest. The wonders of tropical vegetation, as manifested not\r\nonly by vastness of form but also by gorgeous and rank luxuriance, strike\r\nthe eye at first-sight almost the same way as an overpowering chorus\r\naffects the ear. It requires time to collect the thoughts, so as to be\r\nable to appreciate and enjoy thoroughly the extraordinary beauties that\r\nimpress the wondering mind.\r\n\r\nIf the eye of the astonished traveller has been but in the most cursory\r\nmanner directed to the vegetable phenomena that surround him, it must have\r\nrested on a climbing plant, which constitutes one of the chief marvels of\r\nthe native woods. This singular creeper is the _Cipo matador_, a climbing\r\nplant of a very peculiar aspect, at once the most powerful and most\r\ndestructive of all the Cipo tribe. It twines round the stems of lofty\r\ntrees, which its flattened coils gradually constrict with almost life-like\r\ncruelty! Its aërial roots run out from all parts and embrace the tree like\r\nartificial clamps, forming in some places complete rings, and in others\r\ngrowing into the very bark. The tree, in consequence of this parasitic\r\nembrace, dies away by degrees, whilst its destroyer continues to grow\r\ngaily on the corpse of its victim, and spreads its leafy crown until it\r\nfalls and perishes simultaneously with the support that had hitherto\r\nupheld it. To what profound reflections does the contemplation of this\r\nspectacle give rise! Involuntarily our thoughts fly from the wild\r\nBrazilian forest to the plains of civilization,--to the modern society\r\nwhere, likewise, many a noble human nature is slowly undermined by a\r\ntreacherous Cipo matador of flesh and blood, till too surely he falls\r\nprone on the ground!\r\n\r\nPetropolis is, on account of its more temperate and healthy climate, a\r\nfavourite residence of the wealthy Rio de Janeirians, and during the hot\r\nseason, when the sultriness of the air, if not something worse, renders\r\nlife almost unendurable, Petropolis is said to have the appearance of a\r\nEuropean spa. It is at the same time the summer residence of the Emperor,\r\nand the only place in Brazil where an electric telegraph--uniting it with\r\nRio de Janeiro--has been established. The town contains about 7000\r\ninhabitants; the streets, when completed, will be broad and handsome,--but\r\nonly one has as yet been finished, the others being merely marked out,\r\nwhile even among the clean and neat houses already erected, there are\r\nfrequent and wide gaps.\r\n\r\nThe German colony, planned by a German engineer, Julius Friedr. Köhler, is\r\nat a little distance from Petropolis. The first colonists who arrived on\r\nthe 30th of July, 1845, came mostly from Baden and the Rhenish provinces.\r\nThe Government granted to each family a cottage, with a slice of forest\r\nnear it, a cow, a dozen of chickens, and about £5 in money. Such at least\r\nwas the information given us at Petropolis. Köhler soon afterwards met\r\nwith a sad end at a newly-formed shooting ground. Many an emigrant family\r\nperished in misery; others, however, overcame the difficulties that beset\r\nthem at the commencement; more emigrants arrived, and now one may walk,\r\nwithin a few hours, through the Rhine and Mosel valleys, Nassau,\r\nDarmstadt, Ingelheim, Bingen, the Palatinate and Switzerland, as the\r\nemigrants, in fond commemoration of their native homes, call their small\r\nsettlements, which run some distance through the mountain valleys. The\r\nGerman origin of these settlements displays itself distinctly in the\r\ncleanliness and neatness of their log cabins, the affability of the\r\npeople, the heartiness of their greeting, the fair hair, curly heads, and\r\nbeautiful blue eyes of the children, as well as the language and music\r\nwhich is now and then heard.\r\n\r\nPetropolis is, however, not an agricultural colony in the real sense of\r\nthe word, the majority of the 2500 Germans settled there obtaining a\r\nlivelihood as artizans and labourers. The Government has done much to\r\npromote the growth of the colony, by making roads, and establishing\r\nschools. Still the people never become agriculturists, on account of the\r\nsterility of the soil; but as the road to the province of Minas Geraes\r\nruns through the place, the settlement will always retain some importance.\r\nFor the cargoes of coffee which are conveyed by mules from the interior to\r\nthe harbour, Petropolis is the last station, and will remain so for a long\r\ntime yet, for the large outlay required renders it unlikely that the\r\nprojected railway will soon be completed.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to establish similar German colonies in\r\nvarious provinces of the empire, but, unfortunately, with as yet even less\r\nsuccess than in the Serra da Estrella. However, the activity of the\r\nBrazilian emigration agents has much increased in different German ports;\r\nfor the remarkable words of the Emperor, with which he opened the\r\nChambers in May, 1854, at Rio,--\"The necessity of a settled industrious\r\npopulation becomes more and more urgent,\"--have become since then even\r\nmore significant; in fact, the result of the endeavours on the part of the\r\nGovernment to increase the amount of labour by immigration, is now a\r\nquestion of life or death for the empire. Every disinterested person feels\r\nthat, without an increase of labour, productive activity is impossible;\r\nnay, some even apprehend a considerable decrease in the producing\r\ncapabilities of the country, in consequence of the effect to be\r\nanticipated in Brazil from the abolition of the slave-trade by the\r\ninterference of England. Up to the year 1851, the importation of negro\r\nslaves continued undiminished, notwithstanding the treaty with England of\r\n1826, in which the abolition of the slave-trade forms one of the\r\nconditions on which the recognition of the Brazilian crown by the\r\nGovernment of Her Britannic Majesty was made specially contingent.\r\nAccording to a statement of the Foreign Office, there were from 1842 to\r\n1851 (despite the treaty) 325,615 negroes sold as slaves in Brazil, so\r\nthat the amount of the slave population is now upwards of 2,000,000 souls.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the black population in this country is materially\r\ndifferent from that of the United States and the West Indies. The colour\r\nof the skin, which renders the life of even free and prosperous negroes\r\nalmost intolerable in the northern states of America, where they are\r\nsubject to so many humiliations, makes in Brazil no difference whatever.\r\nThe question here is not whether white or black, but whether free or a\r\nslave. Free negroes may here occupy the highest places in the State, and\r\neven exercise a certain influence on the destiny of the white inhabitants.\r\nSlaves also are treated here with more humanity and less prejudice than in\r\nany other country visited by me, on which the curse of slavery yet rests;\r\nyet it must be confessed, without hesitation, that slavery, as beheld in\r\nBrazil, seems even a greater misfortune to the white population than to\r\nthe black; for neither agriculture nor industry can thrive in a country\r\nwhere labour is not considered, as in free States, an honourable\r\noccupation--but rather as a disgrace--in consequence of its being\r\nperformed by slaves. Not merely the blacks, who have no interest in being\r\nindustrious, but their masters also are lazy, and approaching ruin becomes\r\nmore and more certain. Free labour alone, by obtaining the upper hand in\r\nthe country, can remedy these things. Slave labour cannot long compete\r\nwith it. The intelligence, activity, and perseverance of 100,000 free\r\nwhite labourers will promote the prosperity and the happiness of Brazil,\r\nmuch more than the compulsory labour of two millions of negroes in\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of repeated and energetic remonstrances on the part of the\r\nBritish Government, the slave-trade has now ceased in Brazil, and \"one of\r\nthe grandest monuments of our century,\" as the celebrated declaration by\r\nthe Congress of Vienna termed the entire suppression of the\r\nslave-trade,[43] may be considered by this circumstance approaching its\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Déclaration des puissances sur l'abolition de la traite des\r\nnègres, du 8 Février, 1815. L. Neumann, Recueil des traités et conventions\r\nconclus par l'Autriche (Leipzig, 1856. Vol. II., p. 502).]\r\n\r\nAs the Government became convinced that there was not the least hope of\r\nreaping any advantage from civilizing the aboriginal tribes, it had\r\nrecourse to free immigration, and promoted it in every way.[44] It\r\nendeavoured, particularly in the warmer northern provinces, to replace the\r\ndeficiency of negroes by Chinese Coolies, who were imported from different\r\nparts of China; but they could not stand the climate, and were not found\r\ncapable of advantageously replacing the negro in his various and often\r\nvery heavy labour. This partially arose from the indiscriminate selection\r\nof the immigrants, as the agents, when they could not obtain able-bodied\r\nmen, did not scruple to make up their cargo with whatever came to hand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: It may be useful, however, on many accounts to observe, that\r\nthe Brazilian Government take considerable pains to adapt this doomed race\r\nfor a civilized mode of existence. A law of 19th September, 1855, assigned\r\nan annual sum of £6000 for the proper execution of this humane project. In\r\norder to remedy the very marked deficiency of suitable missionaries, the\r\nGovernment, through its representative in Paris, invited a number of\r\nCatholic priests from France--men, whose rearing and zeal for their faith\r\nhad effected such marvels among the Indians of Canada. But the aborigines\r\nof Brazil seem hopelessly degraded, and are destined, after having filled\r\ntheir appointed place in the history of nations, to make room for a more\r\nenergetically endowed race.]\r\n\r\nThe Government pays, therefore, the utmost attention to European\r\nimmigration; it has agents in Portugal, France, Italy, Belgium, and\r\nespecially in Germany; and endeavours to organize associations that have\r\nfor their object the settlement of industrious labourers in the country,\r\nand to support colonies already in existence, till they are in a position\r\nto maintain themselves. In Brazil, the conviction is pretty general, that\r\nonly an emigration _en masse_ of white labour can save this splendid\r\ncountry from ruin, though there are individuals who entertain a different\r\nopinion, and think--perhaps not altogether without reason--that the energy\r\nand industry of European settlers might eventually--considering the\r\nindolent and careless disposition of their countrymen--prove destructive\r\nto the national element!\r\n\r\nThe most striking proof of how thoroughly in earnest the leading members\r\nof the Brazilian Government are in their efforts to procure an immigration\r\nof foreign labour, may be found in the report of the Commission upon the\r\nnew tariff, in which the following passage occurs, illustrative of the\r\nadvantages which may be expected to be reaped from European emigration on\r\na large scale:--\"'These foreign labourers arrive here poor, and depart\r\nfrom the country laden with our gold and silver, and, like blood-suckers,\r\nabsorb our natural riches!' is the remark of those who are ignorant of the\r\ntrue interests of Brazil. For to whom are we indebted for our capital, for\r\nthe industry and commerce which we have? To whom belong those\r\nmanufactories which the people want to protect, and in whose favour so\r\nmuch is said? Why, to foreigners! Foreign hands and foreign capital\r\ncultivate our soil, expand our trade and commerce, and promote the arts.\r\nThe _results_ of their labour remain, though they may themselves quit the\r\ncountry! Foreigners man our ships, build our manufactories, and supply\r\nthem with hands; foreigners buy our produce and carry it to distant\r\nmarkets; foreigners render our forests and rivers productive; they work\r\nour mines, uncover the metallic wealth of our country, and educate our\r\nchildren! Capital, practical science, instruments, and machines, with\r\nwhich we perform our labours, belong mostly to foreigners; and,\r\nconsequently, these blood-suckers are just the very men who render our\r\nland productive, preserving, instead of, as some erroneously imagine,\r\ndepriving us of our vitality. The money which they take back to their\r\nhomes is amply replaced by the treasures they leave behind in the product\r\nof their labour, and in the branches of industry which they have\r\nintroduced or improved.\"[45]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Of the sixty-four manufactories and workshops, twenty-eight\r\nbelong to foreigners; and there is not a single industrial establishment\r\nin which foreigners are not employed, either as managers, engineers, or\r\nlabourers.]\r\n\r\nMore explicitly and discerningly it was hardly possible for Government to\r\nspeak, and to enumerate the glorious results which the country may expect\r\nfrom the introduction of foreign industry and foreign activity, although\r\nsuch an official avowal could not fail to wound the national pride of the\r\nBrazilians.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this strong language of the Government, and all the\r\nenticements and zealous activity of the Brazilian agents in the various\r\nports of Europe, the emigration to that country, in 1856, amounted to\r\nonly 13,800 souls.[46] Among this number there were but 628 agriculturists,\r\nall the others coming merely with the view of obtaining a livelihood in\r\nthe capital as artizans and labourers. There are probably in all the\r\nBrazilian agricultural colonies, at this moment, not more than 40,000\r\nemigrants settled, that is to say, about as many as emigrate in the course\r\nof three months to the United States!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Namely: 9159 Portuguese, 1822 Germans, and 2819 of other\r\nnations.]\r\n\r\nThe number of Germans emigrating to Brazil is strikingly small, when\r\ncompared with the total annual emigration from that country. Of 61,413\r\nindividuals, who, in 1856, embarked from Hamburg and Bremen, only 1822\r\nwent to Brazil. The cause of this may be that, simultaneously with the\r\nlarge promises held out by the agents, warning voices were heard depicting\r\nin the most gloomy colours the terrible trials that await the unfortunate\r\nimmigrant on his touching Brazilian soil.[47] Of late such excellent works\r\nhave been published concerning Brazil, that we may advise all who take a\r\nspecial interest in the condition of that empire to study these works, the\r\nmore so as the views therein expressed exactly coincide with our own\r\nimpressions.[48]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Among these, the opposition of the late Consul-General for\r\nBrazil at Dresden, Mr. John Sturz, deserves special mention, as, despite\r\nthe threats of losing his appointment, that gentleman was incessantly\r\noccupied in exposing the iniquities of the Parceria system (see _post_),\r\nand recommending the immigrant, so long as such a slavish system\r\ncontinued, to refrain from turning his steps towards Brazil. Mr. Sturz had\r\nrecently the enviable misfortune of being sacrificed to his own strong\r\nsense of justice, and dismissed from all employment by the Brazilian\r\nadministration, though not without carrying with him the respect and\r\nadmiration of every friend of humanity. An excellent and circumstantial\r\ndescription of the present condition of the German colonies in southern\r\nBrazil will be found in Dr. Avé Lallemant's attractive \"Travels through\r\nSouthern Brazil in 1858.\" (Leipzig, 1859.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: H. Handelmann's \"History of Brazil\" (Berlin, 1860), a\r\nremarkably profound and instructive work, devotes a special section (p.\r\n933) to the subject of German emigration, and gives a very copious and\r\ncomplete insight into the various missions and works since 1819 to the\r\npresent day, which treat of German emigration and colonization.]\r\n\r\nSo long as the unoccupied lands are not surveyed, laid out in lots, and\r\nsold at a small rate to the settler, as, for instance, in the United\r\nStates; so long as the immigrant is unable to improve for himself his own\r\nplot of ground, but must remain a mere field-labourer, working for some\r\nforeign master, according to the iniquitous _Parceria_, or half-profits\r\nsystem;[49] so long as the expense of transport of the emigrant is to be\r\nworked off by future payments out of his labour, so long must every friend\r\nof humanity strongly dissuade the emigrant from proceeding to the great\r\nSouth American Empire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: The modern Brazilian system of _Parceria_ may be shortly\r\nstated as that by which a planter engages in Europe such of the poorer\r\nclasses as are desirous of emigrating, and has them transported at his own\r\ncost to Brazil, where they are engaged as farmers, with half profits, upon\r\nthe coffee and sugar plantations, and contracting to reimburse him, by\r\ntheir personal services and labour, for the outlay he has been at for\r\ntheir transport, maintenance, instruction, &c. Until all these have been\r\nrepaid by the improvement in the rent or productive powers of the land,\r\nthey must remain, as working out their emancipation from the lord of the\r\nsoil, veritable \"_adscripti glebæ_.\" After that has been attained they are\r\nfree people, and may leave if they please, or may sink into the rank of\r\n\"unattached labourers,\" which implies their assigning half of the net\r\nproduce of the land to the ground landlord, the remaining half being their\r\nremuneration for labour. Proprietorship in the soil is never attainable by\r\nthese farmers on half profits, inasmuch as the Parceria system can only\r\nexist where the soil is already exclusively vested in a planting\r\naristocracy. (See Handelmann, etc., p. 568).]\r\n\r\nFor Brazil, beautiful, fertile, and abounding in undeveloped natural\r\nwealth, two alternatives are alone open at present--either ruin to the\r\nproducing power of the population through deficiency of industrial power,\r\nor the throwing open the land to foreign emigration by means of the most\r\nextensive concessions. The longer this is deferred, the more oppressively\r\nwill the want of manual labour manifest itself; and the more advantages\r\nwill foreign emigration secure.\r\n\r\nOnce, however, these important stipulations are conceded, the German\r\nemigrants may forthwith bend their steps to the coasts of Brazil, where\r\nthe glorious dawn of a magnificent future is surely breaking for them.\r\nWhile, in the United States, the problem to be solved by the German\r\nemigrants seems to be, to mingle German industry, German capacity, and\r\nGerman knowledge, with the keen spirit of enterprise and restless energy\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon race, and gradually to assimilate with it,--on the\r\nother hand, in the South American continent, it appears as though the\r\nGerman element were about gradually to gain the upperhand of the Latin\r\nstock, and permanently to conquer for German industry and German commerce,\r\none of the fairest countries on the globe with the weapons of peace--the\r\nspade and plough.\r\n\r\nBrazil is, however, of great interest to Germany not merely on account of\r\nthe prospects she holds out for its overflowing population. A market,\r\nteeming with the most important colonial products, with an area[50] of\r\n3,956,800 English square miles, and an annual consumption of nearly\r\n£10,000,000, must in the highest degree attract the attention and excite\r\nthe most favourable anticipations of a country such as Germany, the\r\nmajority of whose inhabitants are engaged in manufactures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: According to the computation of the Historico-Geographical\r\nInstitute of Brazil.]\r\n\r\nThe chief article of Brazilian trade at present is coffee, the production\r\nof which, in consequence of the great profit of late years derived from\r\nit, has increased so much, that it has superseded the cultivation of all\r\nother produce; thus, notwithstanding the fertility and capability of the\r\nground, even the commonest necessaries of life, as, for instance,\r\npotatoes, must be imported from abroad, the majority of the rural\r\npopulation being engaged in labour for the foreign market, and only very\r\nfew for home consumption. This is the principal cause of the enormous\r\nprices which, even the most indispensable necessaries have reached in Rio\r\nde Janeiro.\r\n\r\nBrazil grows annually, in the provinces of Rio, Bahia, and Santa\r\nCatharina, 5,190,000 quintals of coffee, consequently more than\r\nthree-fifths of the entire amount produced on the whole earth, and of this\r\nthe province of Rio de Janeiro alone yields two-thirds.\r\n\r\nThe most important objects of export, besides coffee, are sugar, rice,\r\ncotton, hides, and dried meat, together with dye and cabinet woods. The\r\nprogressive decrease of late years in these articles may probably be\r\nascribed to the want of sufficient labour, as well as to the great extent\r\nto which the culture of coffee has been carried.\r\n\r\nAlthough the trade carried on between Brazil and Europe, and its great\r\nimportance, will form the object of a special work, we cannot help\r\nnoticing in this place as a very interesting fact, that among the\r\nimportations, that of wheat-flour holds a very conspicuous place, above\r\n300,000 barrels of 200 lbs. each being annually consumed, of which\r\nseventeen twentieths are supplied by the United States, two twentieths\r\nfrom Trieste and Fiume, and the remaining one twentieth from Lisbon and\r\nValparaiso. The flour from Trieste, by reason of its whiteness and\r\nsuperior quality, commands a high price, so as to necessitate its being\r\nmixed in baking with that from Baltimore. We were told it occasionally\r\nhappens, that the best quality of the much-appreciated Trieste or Fontana\r\nflour reaches the price, altogether unapproachable by the finest American\r\nflour, of 64 to 66 shillings the barrel.\r\n\r\nAs in the interior of the country the flour chiefly used is that called\r\nMandioca, prepared from the root of _Jatropha Manihot_, it follows that\r\nthe chief consumer of wheaten flour is Rio itself, the monthly consumption\r\namounting to upwards of 16,500 barrels. The reason for the small sale of\r\nthe Austrian manufactures in Brazil must be sought for, not so much in the\r\ndeficient supplies of the articles required, as in the circumstance that\r\nthe Austrian manufacturers have not hitherto found it much their interest\r\nto study the Brazilian market, so as to make the requisite alterations in\r\nthe method of producing their fabrics, and thus render them suitable for\r\nthat purpose. What little of our Austrian manufactures is at present\r\nexported for Brazilian consumption, seems at present to follow the, to all\r\nappearance, much less natural route northwards, and instead of proceeding\r\nfrom Trieste direct, is exported from Bremen or Hamburg as fabrics of\r\nNorthern Germany.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Rio, Commodore Wüllerstorf, accompanied by Captain\r\nPöck, and one of the members of the scientific commission, had the honour\r\nof being presented to the Emperor and Empress of Brazil, at a private\r\naudience. The reception took place at the winter residence of St.\r\nChristoph. It is an old unsightly building, and still unfinished, the\r\ncentral part especially having been for some years in a ruinous condition.\r\nThe Emperor seems not to be partial to display, and a very characteristic\r\nanecdote in this respect, which does him great credit, is very generally\r\nreported. On the occasion of a visit to the splendid lunatic asylum of\r\nBotafogo, one of the ministers remarked to His Majesty that the inmates of\r\nthe establishment were better and more elegantly lodged than himself. \"It\r\nwill always afford me great pleasure,\" was the reply, \"to know that these\r\nunfortunate people are better provided for than I am.\"\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the palace at St. Christoph, the gentlemen of the\r\nExpedition were received by an ecclesiastic, who led them into an\r\nexceedingly plain ante-chamber, the furniture of which seemed to belong to\r\nbygone centuries. Several of the ministers of state, whose servants\r\ncarried large portfolios, exchanged compliments with the Austrian\r\nminister, and entered the contiguous apartments. Chamberlains and\r\ndomestics of the court looked stealthily at the strangers, and disappeared\r\nas rapidly as they had come. It seemed as though these presentations were\r\nof infrequent occurrence. At last, about half-past 6 P.M. the door opened,\r\nwhen His Majesty and the ministers walked through the room into the hall\r\nof audience, into which the gentlemen of the Expedition were soon\r\nafterwards conducted by a chamberlain. The Austrian minister presented\r\neach separately to His Majesty Dom Pedro II., who is the son of an\r\nAustrian Archduchess, and received the gentlemen in the uniform of an\r\nadmiral, surrounded by all his ministers. He is a fine-looking man, of\r\nsome 30 years of age, of stately appearance, but with a voice somewhat too\r\nthin for so robust a person. The portrait on the Brazilian coinage is\r\nremarkably like. The conversation was carried on in French; it is said,\r\nhowever, that the Emperor speaks German fluently. He conversed very\r\naffably and graciously with every one, and had something agreeable to say\r\nto each, expressing much interest in the _Novara_ Expedition. After\r\nseveral questions, the Emperor wished us success on our future voyage, and\r\nretired, upon which the audience was at an end.\r\n\r\nAfter the members of the Expedition had remained a short space in a corner\r\nof the audience chamber, they were conducted through a narrow boarded\r\npassage to the apartments of the Empress. In the ante-chamber we again\r\nencountered the Emperor, who had exchanged his admiral's uniform for plain\r\nclothes, and now stood before us in the undress black frock he usually\r\nwears.\r\n\r\nWe were now ushered into the small and very plainly furnished\r\nreception-room of the Empress, in which there was nothing to attract\r\nattention except a couple of highly-finished portraits. Her Majesty, a\r\nsister of the late King Ferdinand II. of Naples, and of Queen Maria\r\nChristina of Spain, was in mourning owing to a death in the family. She\r\nwas only attended by one lady in waiting, and received us with infinite\r\ngrace. She is rather short in stature, and although still young, looks\r\naged; in conversation she becomes however very animated, and thereby gains\r\nin gracefulness; her favourite theme was Italy, on which she dwelt with\r\nchildlike fondness. Speaking of Naples, its charming bay, of the Vesuvius,\r\nand the lovely walk of Santa Lucia, near the sea, the tone of her voice\r\nbecame involuntarily more lively. Notwithstanding the tropical splendour,\r\nand an Imperial throne, the Princess seems to have a great longing for her\r\nnative land. Alas! even an imperial crown is no protection against the\r\nyearning for home!\r\n\r\nDuring our stay here, the anniversary came round of the birth of our\r\ngracious Emperor, which was celebrated in the most festive manner. From\r\nearly dawn the frigate appeared decked out in her gayest flags, which was\r\nsimilarly responded to by the English and French ships of war in the\r\nharbour. At 8 A.M., with the customary salutes of the ensign, a salute of\r\ntwenty-one guns was fired, as also at mid-day and sunset. At 11 A.M., the\r\ncrew were paraded and divine service was performed, to which our resident\r\nenvoy and his family were invited, together with the acting\r\nConsul-General, the captain of an Austrian vessel, and a few Austrians who\r\nhappened to be at that time in Rio. After service, the foreign guests and\r\nseveral officers of the staff were entertained by the commodore at\r\nbreakfast. In the evening there was a banquet at the hotel of the envoy,\r\nat which were present several notabilities of the empire of Brazil, among\r\nothers, Viscount Maranguapè, minister of foreign affairs, and the Senator\r\nViscount de Uruguay. In the garden of the club the frigate's band of music\r\nplayed chiefly German and Austrian pieces, which awoke in the bosoms of\r\nmany the most tender recollections.\r\n\r\nThe frequent arrival of men of war in the bay of Rio gives rise to an\r\nalmost continual firing; each vessel entering fires a royal salute, which\r\nis answered by the fortress and the other ships of war in the harbour.\r\nDuring our stay we discharged not less than 432 salvos, while all the men\r\nof war together fired at least 1500 salvos, thus making, within three\r\nweeks, about 5250 rounds of gunpowder, used merely in salutes.\r\n\r\nThe 31st of August had been fixed as the date of our departure. During the\r\nlatter days of our stay, there had been frequent collations on board to\r\nmake some return to those who had shown us attention. Several of the sick,\r\none midshipman and two sailors, had to be left behind in hospital, where\r\nthey received the most careful treatment, while Dr. Avé Robert Lallemant,\r\nwho, by the kind recommendation of Humboldt, had been permitted by the\r\nArchduke to accompany the Expedition with the rank of surgeon of corvette,\r\nfor the purpose of prosecuting his studies of yellow fever, was, at his\r\nown request, put ashore at Rio, whence he afterwards undertook the journey\r\nthrough Southern Brazil already alluded to.\r\n\r\nThe night previous, three sailors had deserted from a boat sent on shore\r\nto bring back some officers. The system of kidnapping, as is well known,\r\nflourishes in Rio, and many a ship is said to have lost, in this way, from\r\nthirty to forty men. The crimps, who make their living by this traffic in\r\nman, entice young and robust sailors to desert by means of all imaginable\r\nallurements and promises, making advances in money, and leading them into\r\na dissolute life, in order that, when afterwards they find themselves in a\r\ndesperate state, and without resources, they may be sold by the scoundrels\r\nto the captains of vessels, as sailors, or, what is worse, as white\r\nslaves, to the planters in the interior. This abominable trade is said to\r\nbe carried on, on a great scale, by an Italian, in Catumbý Grande, and\r\nthough the Brazilian police is perfectly cognizant of the haunts of the\r\nfellow, yet it seems not to be powerful enough to put a stop to the\r\nnuisance.\r\n\r\nThese incidents did not, however, interfere with our departure at the\r\nspecified hour, when we were towed out by the tug steamer _Perseverancia_,\r\nwhich we had hired for _£25_. Almost every large ship on leaving Rio is\r\ntowed clear of the bay, so as to avoid having to tack between the islands,\r\nor perhaps have to anchor, so that the tug, which belongs to a private\r\nindividual, and accompanied us eastward as far as the island of Razza,\r\nmust be a source of considerable profit.\r\n\r\nOn 31st August, at six A.M., we bade farewell to the splendid harbour of\r\nRio. We had fortunately reached Rio after the visit of the yellow fever,\r\nbut the almost continual rainy weather had spoiled many an excursion, and\r\ndeprived us of the opportunity of more closely examining the environs of\r\nthe city. Nor were we more successful in making ourselves at home here,\r\nnotwithstanding the kind reception with which we were favoured by the\r\nGovernment and some private individuals. There is, in short, a great want\r\nof sociability, and we may add, almost utter indifference to scientific\r\npursuits, which indeed appeal in vain to the great majority of the\r\nBrazilian population. Of course there are numerous and agreeable\r\nexceptions; but slavery, the mixture of races, the egotism and indolence\r\nof the wealthier classes, are all reasons why a European, just arrived,\r\ncannot feel himself comfortable. The white Brazilians bear, in some\r\nrespects, a strong resemblance to the Italians, but they are deficient in\r\ntheir pleasing, insinuating demeanour, in their cheerful humour, quickness\r\nof perception, and lively imagination. They occupy a lower scale in social\r\nculture, without depth of thought or feeling, and seem almost incapable of\r\npersevering activity. This perceptible deficiency of hearty, energetic\r\ntemperament, in addition to the confused intermingling of other foreign\r\nnations, which seem to regard the country as booty, to be abandoned so\r\nsoon as success has crowned their labours, imparts to each new arrival a\r\nfeeling of depression, which, so far from being weakened, is yet more\r\nkeenly felt by those who have lived some time in the country, so that not\r\nmerely among foreigners recently arrived, but with those also who have\r\nspent years at Rio, the desire to leave these shores becomes rather\r\nincreased than diminished by a longer acquaintance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.--FROM RIO DI JANEIRO TO THE CAPE\r\nOF GOOD HOPE.]\r\n\r\nAt nine A.M., we cast off from the tug, not far from the little island of\r\nRazza, with its lighthouse, and spread our sails to the breeze, which\r\ngradually freshened, but blew from the N.E., which was foul for our\r\ncourse. However, we could still derive some advantage from even this as it\r\nwas our intention to steer southerly from Rio, so as to be able to make\r\nalmost exclusively a great circle course to the Cape of Good Hope, after\r\nwe should have got further south than the Antarctic limit of the S.E.\r\ntrades.\r\n\r\nThe near termination of the winter quarter in this southern hemisphere,\r\nthe approximation of the sun towards the south pole, and the consequent\r\ntendency of the zones of wind and currents of air to pursue the same\r\ndirection, gave us reason to hope, that when approaching the limits of the\r\ntrades, we should find a change of wind, which should shorten the voyage,\r\nor at all events keep us clear of storms.\r\n\r\nIn the open ocean, where there are no hills or extraordinary conformations\r\nof land to break the uniformity of the earth's surface, and where the\r\nexpanse of water is unbroken by any extensive group of islands, the\r\ndisturbances in the atmospheric belt must necessarily be much less\r\nstrongly marked than where continents are interposed, or in the narrow\r\nseas. The winds themselves, under such circumstances, display even in\r\ntheir shifts a certain amount of regularity, which is usually dependent\r\nupon the universal laws of nature.\r\n\r\nOnce any one is so fortunate as to comprehend the latter in all their\r\nextent, so as to be cognisant of their results, it becomes a mere\r\nquestion of the study of local conditions in order to be able to declare\r\nhow these universal laws operate, and to elucidate by the most simple\r\nexplanations many of the phenomena of nature that have till now baffled\r\nscience. Thus, when a wind hitherto steady shifts its direction, there\r\nmust necessarily be, certain active causes for its doing so; if these\r\ncauses perpetually recur in well-marked periodical intervals, the change\r\nof the wind must follow a definite law. Under certain circumstances the\r\ndirection of the wind is well-defined; as, for instance, at certain\r\nseasons in the open ocean it remains always the same, or changes with a\r\ncertain regularity, whence it becomes apparent that the causes must remain\r\nunchanging, and the recurrence of the phenomenon must accordingly admit of\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nWe know, for example, that in the case of hurricanes--those most terrific\r\nexemplifications of the tendency of the atmosphere to move in circles--the\r\nwind does not blow in straight lines, but rather in curves described round\r\na central point, which again is not immovable, but has a regular\r\nprogression along a definite curve. In that curved plane, however, which\r\nhas been termed a _cyclone_, the wind always blows in one and the same\r\ndirection, and in the Northern Hemisphere runs counter to the motion of a\r\nwatch-hand, while in the Southern Hemisphere it, on the contrary, follows\r\nthat motion.\r\n\r\nThese facts once granted as accounting for such phenomena, it follows as a\r\nnatural consequence of the general principles laid down, that they hold\r\ngood in minor cases, and must remain of the same efficacy, whether it be a\r\nhurricane or a dust-whirl which may be under consideration.\r\n\r\nSo, too, in conformity with those laws, light winds may be found subject\r\nto a variation in direction of a similar nature, such as may not perhaps\r\nbe fully exemplified in every case, but simply serve to indicate the\r\ntendency of the wind to follow the same general direction as the\r\nhurricanes themselves.\r\n\r\nThe importance of ascertaining such curvilinearity in the direction of the\r\nwinds will be especially manifest at the limits within which the regular\r\nwinds prevail, and when they must necessarily become intermingled with\r\nother regular currents of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as we neared the limit of the S.E. Trades, which always\r\nextend somewhat further south, as the sun's southern declination\r\nincreases, we had to traverse regions where necessarily we encountered\r\nvariable winds, owing to the increased area of the Trades. There are also\r\nfound occasional spots at which a more rarefied atmosphere seems to fill\r\nthe surrounding space, when there is seen a similar process to that in the\r\ncase of hurricanes, first visible perhaps in the higher strata, but\r\nafterwards extending to those which are lower.\r\n\r\nThe winds, then, shifted with much regularity, and with them the\r\natmospheric pressure, just as in the case of cyclones, except that neither\r\nthe wind nor the sea ever presented the characteristics of a tempest. The\r\nwind, which began to blow from the North-East, drew gradually to North,\r\nthence West and South, and returned to S.E., after short intervals of\r\ncalm. We could thus perceive, on referring to the ship's log, that the\r\nentire cycle was completed in five or six days; so that it became quite\r\npossible, by examining the central direction of the daily variation, to\r\nforetell the wind which must be blowing twelve hours later, when, upon\r\ntaking into consideration the path described by such central direction\r\nfrom day to day, it appeared that the wind described very nearly a\r\nparabolic curve.\r\n\r\nEven the aspect of the heavens, and the state of the weather, were only\r\none degree less regular in their alternations than the hurricanes. With\r\nthe S.E. wind, the sky was bright, but as soon as it began to veer round,\r\ntowards afternoon, a few white belts of cirrhous clouds began to appear in\r\nthe western heavens, constituting a well-marked division of the vault of\r\nthe sky from one side quite to the other. As it drew still further round,\r\nand neared the line of centres, the weather grew foul, a driving scud\r\ncovered the heavens, and a succession of splendid rainbows were seen, till\r\nthe ship had reached the nearest spot to the storm-centre when there were\r\nsharp squalls of wind, accompanied by heavy showers of rain. The lower\r\nstrata of clouds, mere vapour, drove before the wind, while those above\r\nmoved in a directly contrary direction, generally that of the forthcoming\r\nwind. The atmospheric pressure, which at first would be considerable,\r\ngradually decreased as we approached the central line; as we drew away\r\nfrom that centre the barometer rose again, the weather improved, and the\r\nsky under the influence of southerly winds once more cleared.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it is not practicable with a single ship to ascertain\r\nwhether the veering of the wind follows an exact curve, as we can only say\r\nwhat is the direction at the spot where the observation has been made, and\r\nit is impossible to determine what it may be at other points. But it is at\r\nall events certain that the shifts of wind are amenable to the same\r\ngeneral laws as hurricanes. A number of ships sent out for the special\r\npurpose of this branch of investigation, could render immense services to\r\nscience and navigation, and achieve most interesting results.\r\n\r\nWe availed ourselves of these general laws to traverse the ocean as\r\nspeedily as possible, in order to reach early our next anchorage, and in\r\nso doing we experienced altogether three well-marked cycles of wind at\r\nshort intervals. We cannot afford space to prosecute all the interesting\r\nconsequences that result from these phenomena of nature, such\r\ninvestigations being more properly reserved for the meteorological section\r\nof the scientific portion of this work. Here, however, the facilities for\r\nobservation of a sea-faring life have been directed towards an object of\r\ninquiry, which must prove of immense utility in navigation and commerce.\r\nAnd, perhaps, even landsmen may not find it uninteresting, that even that\r\nproverbially fickle element, air, obeys certain fixed laws, a more\r\naccurate acquaintance with which must be of the utmost importance to the\r\ndenizen of _terra firma_, as well as those \"that go down to the sea in\r\nships, that do business in great waters.\"\r\n\r\nOn this passage from the American to the African coasts, we were\r\ncontinually accompanied by our winged friends, the sea-birds, which,\r\nnotwithstanding the unkind treatment they received at the hands of the\r\nzoological sportsmen, followed us with the utmost pertinacity, probably\r\nattracted by the numerous fragments of provisions thrown overboard.\r\n\r\nThe Cape pigeons (_Procellaria sp._), those prettily-marked sea-birds,\r\nabout the size of doves, the albatrosses, (_Diomedea sp._) the largest of\r\nthe ocean feathered tribe, with their quiet majestic flight, stormy\r\npetrels of all sorts and sizes, from the smallest swallow to the largest\r\nof its kind; all these winged inhabitants of the sea's surface followed\r\nthe frigate in motley groups, and seemed never to weary in their active\r\nsearch for food.\r\n\r\nSometimes they alighted, rested on the surface of the water, and were left\r\nfar behind; but they collected again with great rapidity as soon as\r\nanything eatable appeared, and overtook the frigate in a swift flight from\r\nthe remotest point of the horizon. This singular attachment to ships very\r\nprobably arises from their being accustomed to follow whalers, from which\r\nsuch a large quantity of garbage is thrown overboard, very much affected\r\nby these aërial parasites, whence they learn to expect from all vessels\r\ntheir favourite food.\r\n\r\nThey possess a remarkable capacity for remembering the exact time when\r\nthey are likely to receive a large quantity of eatables from on board.\r\nEvery day, about noon, the vicinity of the ship became animated, and\r\ntowards one o'clock, after the crew had finished dinner, these lively\r\ncreatures were close behind, and even fought for the pieces of tow with\r\nwhich the coppers had been cleansed. The boldest amongst them was the Cape\r\npigeon, which pounced, with the utmost avidity, upon the dainty morsels\r\nthrown overboard, raising a loud scream, swimming round its prey, diving\r\nfor sinking fragments, or snatching from each other those they had\r\nsecured. Then came the black and brown-spotted and white albatrosses. As\r\nsoon as one of these colossal birds appeared on the scene of strife, the\r\nuproar of the screaming pigeons at once became still; they kept themselves\r\nat a respectful distance from the voracious albatross, which quietly\r\nconsumed its lion's share. In a few moments, yet greater numbers of these\r\nassembled, of which the black ones (_Ph[oe]betria fuliginosa_), like the\r\nlarge petrels, are extremely shy, and rarely approach the ship within\r\ngun-shot. The other large-sized petrels acted similarly, the brown\r\nspectacled-petrel, so named from two singular-looking black rings round\r\nthe eyes, being the most numerous. Along with these were several small\r\nMother Carey's Chickens, and flights of other winged creatures swarming\r\nover the sea. The darker the sky, the more agitated the sea, the more\r\nactively do the Cape pigeons tumble and toss behind the ship; it appears\r\nthat in rough stormy weather they see less distinctly and find food with\r\ndifficulty, in consequence of which they are in a famished state. Only\r\nunder these circumstances, and when the ship is moving slowly, can they\r\nbe caught with a line. To angle for birds may appear rather odd to the\r\nreader, and yet it is common enough in the Southern Ocean, amusing the\r\nsailor, and providing the zoologist with means of obtaining these birds\r\nalive. For this purpose, however, circumstances must be comparatively\r\nfavourable; that is to say, the weather must be rough, the sea agitated,\r\nand the ship making but little headway. When the sky is serene, and the\r\nsea calm, even the Cape pigeons do not think it worth their while to throw\r\na glance at the bait; and if the ship is moving fast, they have not speed\r\nenough to catch it, because they only swim, and the ship outspeeds them.\r\nThe line, moreover, must be of tolerable length, so as, in the event of\r\nany bird evincing a desire to snap, to allow as much to be paid out as is\r\nnecessary to leave the bait precisely in the same spot, without towing it\r\nthrough the water. It sometimes also occurs, particularly after sunset,\r\nthat these birds, continually following in the wake of the ship, do not\r\nsee the line, strike against it, and entangle themselves so that they may\r\nbe easily drawn on board. The scream of the storm-pigeon when caught,\r\nmakes it betray its fate even before those on board have an idea that it\r\nhas been captured.\r\n\r\nFor the albatross, it is of course necessary to use a stronger hook, which\r\nit is best to attach to a copper wire, because this being thinner than\r\nline, is not so readily perceived. In order that the whole apparatus may\r\nswim on the surface of the water, a few cork floats are also made fast.\r\n\r\nWhen an albatross has hooked itself, the full strength of a man is\r\nrequisite to draw it on board, for the bird, in its despair, dives and\r\nkeeps its wings spread under water, so that the resistance is very\r\nconsiderable, and frequently even the strongest lines are broken. This\r\ncannot be wondered at when their size is considered, as they measure from\r\n10 to 14 feet across the extended wings, while their weight amounts to\r\nfrom 10 to 18 lbs.\r\n\r\nArrived on deck, none of these sea-birds are able to fly away; they move\r\nvery clumsily on their webbed feet, and can only rise after a slanting\r\nspring, which, however, they cannot accomplish on firm ground; if in the\r\nwater these birds want to rise into the air whilst swimming, they flutter\r\ntheir outspread wings for a little, and use their webbed feet in a kind of\r\nrowing motion, in order to acquire the requisite impetus. The albatross\r\ndefends itself with its bill, which is often four to five inches long, and\r\ncare must be taken to avoid being wounded in catching them. We also\r\nremarked that the Cape pigeons, in their rage at being captured, vomited\r\nup a slimy greasy substance.\r\n\r\nThe latter bird was of course new to us, and afforded us much amusement.\r\nMany were knocked over with the fowling-piece, especially when, in their\r\ninquisitiveness, they came too near the boats, which, as often as our rate\r\nof progress admitted, were launched with the view of adding to our\r\ncollection of objects of natural history.\r\n\r\nIn shooting an albatross large shot must be used, as, at a distance of 15\r\nor 20 feet, small shot do not penetrate the feathers and the down of the\r\nbird. What is most remarkable as regards these birds is the numerous\r\nparasites that live upon their bodies. It is most extraordinary how\r\ncertain of these birds (as for instance, the _Puffins_ and _Procellariæ_)\r\nare infested by insects, their plumage sometimes swarming with small\r\nspecimens of _Crustaceæ_.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of September, the famous Table Mountain of the Cape was\r\nvisible, after we had, the evening previous, at a distance of fourteen\r\nmiles, sighted the lighthouse of Table Bay.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-six days of our voyage hither had flown quickly past, and we\r\nwere still able vividly to recall the impressions made by Brazil, and the\r\nscenes we had gone through in mid-ocean, as the southernmost point of\r\nAfrica came in sight with its characteristic hills, and our eyes and our\r\nthoughts were directed to another quarter of the globe. On the one hand,\r\nexcited with the prospect of new scenery, and on the other, anxious to\r\ncomplete our elaborate observations upon Brazil, so as to be able to send\r\nthem home from the Cape, we found ourselves in a frame of mind which kept\r\nus alternately hard at the desk, or drove us on deck to admire the\r\nremarkable outline of Cape Colony. We did not, at the present season,\r\nthink it advisable to run right into the bay, so as to anchor near Cape\r\nTown, but resolved to double the Cape, and proceed to Simon's Bay, the\r\nusual anchorage for ships-of-war. We were, however, sadly disappointed in\r\nthe hope of soon reaching it, as the south-east wind freshened so much\r\nthat on the 27th it had become a gale, which forced us out to sea again.\r\nThe world-known swell off the Cape began under the ever-increasing wind to\r\nrun high, and we were soon involved in one of those famous Cape storms\r\nwhich justified the Portuguese in calling the promontory of South Africa,\r\n\"Cabo Tormentoso,\" or the Cape of Storm.[51]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51:\r\n\r\n    \"Through such mad seas the daring Gama fought,\r\n    Incessant toiling round the stormy Cape.\"\r\n                        (_Lord Strangford's Camoens._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe wind and spray roared and lashed through the rigging: higher and\r\nhigher rose the huge mountains of water, with their white crests, that\r\ntossed the ship like a plaything from side to side. The waves foamed in\r\nthrough the port-holes on the gun-deck, while masts, cordage, timbers,\r\nevery part of the ship groaned and creaked, a perfect medley of sights and\r\nsounds, including woful destruction of crockery, and the heavy rolling of\r\nerratic cannon-shot that had broken loose from the rack, and were rushing\r\nabout the deck--above all which was heard the shrill whistle of the pipe\r\nof the boatswain's mate. The scene fairly baffled all powers of\r\ndescription, and must have been eminently impressive for those who for the\r\nfirst time experienced what is meant by \"a gale at sea,\" especially at\r\nnight, when the moon, struggling through the flying vapours, lit up the\r\nappalling scene with a livid supernatural tint.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 28th the gale reached its highest point, and raged\r\nfearfully for some hours. The frigate proved herself, in this turbulence\r\nof the waters, to be thoroughly seaworthy. At the same time the sun shone\r\nbrilliantly, the sky was clear and beautiful, and only here and there some\r\nfeathery clouds were to be seen. There was a curious sense of dualism in\r\nthis serenity of the sky, in contrast with the fury and agitation of the\r\nwaves. Gradually the wind chopped round towards the east, which gave some\r\nhope that the gale would abate, but, nevertheless, the ship was tossed\r\nabout worse than ever.\r\n\r\nThe waves, like gigantic ridges, mounted, according to measurement, to the\r\nheight of from 30 to 35 feet above the mean level of the sea, and\r\noccasioned that terrible rolling of the ship, and those fearful lurches,\r\nwhich, once experienced, are not readily forgotten.\r\n\r\nHitherto the altitude of a wave has been generally measured merely by the\r\neye, so that the result depended too much on the accuracy of individual\r\nobservation to admit of its being exactly ascertained; and it is for this\r\nreason that the statements relative to the maximum height of the ocean\r\nwave are so various that they cannot be considered reliable, for whilst\r\nsome observers estimate them to be from 60 to 70 feet, others reckon them\r\nonly at from 30 to 40 feet.\r\n\r\nOn board the _Novara_ the following method of admeasurement was adopted:\r\nwe first determined, by a chronometer, the time that a wave takes to pass\r\nfrom one end of the ship to the other, whereby the velocity of the\r\nprogressive motion of the wave could be calculated in relation to the\r\nship's course and speed, regard being had to the direction and velocity\r\nof the ship against it. With this velocity ascertained, we were in a\r\nposition to determine and fix the average distance between two consecutive\r\nwaves. Lastly, the height of the wave was ascertained from the angle at\r\nwhich the frigate rose and fell in the line of its keel, by the influence\r\nof each successive wave and by means of the ascertained distance from the\r\ntrough of the sea to the crest of the wave. Though this method, likewise,\r\nhas many difficulties and deficiencies, yet it appears well suited to make\r\ncorrect comparisons between the different waves; and, under certain\r\nfavourable conditions, it yields so accurate a result, that at any rate it\r\nis to be preferred to mere guess-work, besides that the experiment itself\r\nis susceptible of many improvements. It seems safe to assume that waves\r\nscarcely ever attain an elevation of more than 40 or 45 feet.\r\n\r\nThe gale had driven us a long distance out, and only after great trouble\r\ndid we again near the land. On the 1st of October the Cape came once more\r\nin sight; we tacked, in order to get into the wide gulf termed False Bay,\r\nby which in some respects the peninsula of the Cape is formed, being\r\nseparated only by a low sandy plain from the Atlantic. Whittle's rock\r\nrenders tacking in its neighbourhood in so far more difficult, as the\r\nexisting charts of the bay are not sufficiently exact to be implicitly\r\nrelied on. Buoys have often been fixed in that quarter, but every new gale\r\ncarried them away again; so that the position of the rock is not\r\nindicated. An English pilot now came on board, who brought papers, and\r\nintelligence that a number of letters were waiting for us. Our impatience\r\nbecame stronger when towards evening the light breeze entirely ceased, and\r\nwe thereby were forced to bring up at a distance of a mile and a half from\r\nthe actual anchorage. About the same time an officer arrived from the\r\nBritish line-of-battle-ship _Boscawen_, under the flag of Rear-Admiral\r\nGrey, in order to serve as a guide should no pilot have boarded us.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of October, at 7 A.M., the anchor was let go in Simon's Bay, a\r\nspacious but gloomy-looking sheet of water. Here ships ride much more\r\nsecure than in Table Bay, from which, in a stiff westerly or\r\nnorth-westerly breeze, vessels are often forced to run out to sea to avoid\r\nbeing driven on shore. The communication with the land is thus sometimes\r\ninterrupted for days. From Simon's Bay to Table Bay, round the Cape the\r\ndistance is forty miles, whilst by land the journey to the capital of the\r\ncolony is, with good horses, performed in three hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CABO TORMENTOSO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPE TOWN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n                          Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n                   STAY FROM 2ND TO 26TH OCTOBER, 1857.\r\n\r\n   Contrasts of scenery and seasons at Cape Colony.

Coming from the charming coast of\r\nBrazil, with its luxuriant verdure, the contrast becomes doubly\r\nunpleasing. A narrow green strip of land, running along from a small fort,\r\nforms a refreshing sight and a resting point for the eye fatigued with\r\nlooking at these grim masses of stone. The traveller who merely touches at\r\nSimon's Bay without pushing into the interior, or who visits the Cape in\r\nthe winter of the southern hemisphere (from April to September), can\r\nscarcely form an idea of the voluptuous loveliness which reigns during\r\nspring and summer in the interior of the colony, and will regard as\r\nfictitious those brilliant descriptions of its natural beauties, related\r\nby travellers who have been fortunate enough to visit this point of South\r\nAfrica at those genial seasons.\r\n\r\nHad we left the Cape without seeing anything else than the melancholy\r\nneighbourhood of False Bay and the dull little settlement of Simon's Town,\r\non its left bank, we should have carried away very different impressions\r\nand ideas to those entertained after having during spring passed some\r\nweeks in the delightful interior, and obtained at the same time an insight\r\ninto the social condition of the colony.\r\n\r\nOn the very day that we cast anchor in the bay, we took a stroll (our\r\nfirst footfall upon the soil of Africa) through Simon's Town, which\r\nconsists of a single street of about forty clean, neat, and tidy-looking\r\nhouses, straggling along the shore. The principal buildings are the\r\nArsenal, the residence of the admiral of the station, five churches (one\r\nof which belongs to Roman Catholics), and two tolerably large hotels.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to conceive any town occupying a more dreary dismal\r\nsite, with the exception, perhaps, of some of the Peruvian settlements on\r\nthe west coast of South America. While the eye, below this row of houses,\r\nbeholds nothing but granite rocks thickly strewn with shells, the main\r\nstreet is overhung by steep sandstone rocks, which, despite the marvellous\r\nrichness of the blooming flowers, that well repay the researches of the\r\nnaturalist, have a naked gloomy aspect, viewed from a distance, and are\r\nenvironed right and left by waste patches of white sand.\r\n\r\nThe favourite walks of this small place seem to be along the shore, or on\r\nthe road to Cape Town, into the soft sand of which the foot of the\r\ntraveller is continually sinking. A number of ladies and gentlemen whom we\r\nmet walking appeared to be somewhat surprised at the unusual appearance of\r\nan Austrian man-of-war, the flag of which was gaily fluttering in the\r\ngloomy bay. The residents in Simon's Town, amounting to about 800 souls,\r\nare mostly Malays, descendants of those numerous compulsory emigrants,\r\nwho, during the period of Dutch ascendency at the Cape, had been\r\ntransported from Java and other islands of the Indian Archipelago, owing\r\nto the want of labour or for political causes. For the Dutch used to send\r\nto the Cape Colony, as a place of banishment, many wealthy and influential\r\nMalay families, by whom the first germs of Mohammedanism were introduced\r\ninto South Africa. It would even seem that the religious opinions of the\r\nMalay population exercise some influence on the habits of the Christian\r\nsettlers of Simon's Town, as no butcher, for instance, would venture to\r\nkill and sell pigs for fear of giving offence to his Mohammedan customers.\r\n\r\nOn a fine spring morning we started in a handsome vehicle from Simon's Bay\r\nto Cape Town. The road runs close along the seashore, which, seen from a\r\ndistance, apparently consists of nothing but sand and rock, but, on more\r\nnear acquaintance, exhibits at various points delightful nooks decked with\r\nmost beautiful flowers. Everything indicated, by its glorious blooming\r\ngarment, the bursting forth of spring.\r\n\r\nOne hour's ride led us to a neat little fishing hamlet where an immense\r\nnumber of fish were hanging up to dry in the sun. The bones of whales are\r\nused by the inhabitants for all sorts of purposes; they fence their fields\r\nand gardens with the ribs, build walls with the vertebræ, make steps and\r\nstairs of the shoulder bones, and use the large jaw-bones as arches at the\r\nentrances of their huts. One of the owners of this fishing station was\r\nkind enough to offer us, as a particular dainty, a piece of flesh cut from\r\nthe jaw of a whale and boiled in fat; but we were not exactly of the same\r\nopinion after having, from curiosity, tasted a few mouthfuls. The bay is\r\nvery rich in the snook-fish (_Thyrsites Atun_), of which several hundred\r\ntons are pickled here annually and sent to the Mauritius.\r\n\r\nAnother fish caught here is said to be extremely injurious to health, and\r\neven to endanger life--the small toadfish (_Tetraodon Honkenyi_), which\r\nexists in shoals, and may easily be caught with a line. One of the harbour\r\nregulations consists of a special paragraph warning seamen against using\r\nthis poisonous \"sea-devil.\" Foreign sailors who have eaten of it have died\r\na few minutes after.\r\n\r\nOn leaving this fishing station the road, leaving the coast, proceeds in a\r\nstraight line over the plain which unites the Cape with the continent. The\r\nmountains recede, and the eye of the traveller gazes, charmed and\r\nsurprised, on the mountain range of the peninsula, the celebrated Table\r\nand Devil's Mountains. The plain, which, during the dry season, is nothing\r\nbut an arid desert, was now seen in its fullest beauty, like a flowery\r\ncarpet, on which innumerable blossoms of varied hues and forms were\r\ninterwoven. On the left lie the renowned vineyards of Constantia, and to\r\nthe right stands what is called Halfway-house, the property of a native of\r\nWürtemberg who, some twenty years before, came to the Cape a poor\r\nemigrant, and is now a wealthy and respected man, known far and wide,\r\nholding several official appointments, and showing himself a warm patron\r\nof his German countrymen. Being a zealous sportsman, and intimately\r\nacquainted with the locality, Mr. Rathfelder was of great service to our\r\nzoologists, who took up their residence at this place.\r\n\r\nFrom the Halfway-house to Cape Town the character of the landscape\r\ncompletely changes. The road leads through a park-like country; charming\r\nwood plantations, pines and oaks, stretch on either hand to the extreme\r\nlimits of an undulating plain, intersected by long shady paths, the\r\nvistas terminating with elegant villas built in the Dutch or English\r\nstyle. Here are Cape waggons, drawn by ten to twenty oxen, side by side\r\nwith elegant two or four-horse carriages and densely-packed omnibuses,\r\nsuch as one may see in Cheapside. We have now arrived in the charming\r\nRondebosch, a village that might well aspire to the dignity of a town,\r\nchiefly inhabited as a summer residence by the wealthier inhabitants of\r\nCape Town. The impression made by this beautiful road will never be\r\nobliterated from the memory of any one who has ever ridden over it in the\r\nspring. We were as much delighted by the sight of this smiling and verdant\r\nlandscape as we had been depressed by the sandy plains of Simon's Bay.\r\nThere, extended in charming variety before the fascinated eye, lay Table\r\nBay with its ships, Cape Town, and the gigantic rocky wall of the Table\r\nMountain resting on its granite base, and rising nearly perpendicular to\r\nan altitude of 3500 feet, together with the Lion's Head and the Devil's\r\nPeak. The distant background on the other side of the plain is bounded by\r\nthe precipitous face of high, rugged, and broken mountain walls, the\r\nsummits of which were covered with snow.\r\n\r\nConvenient and comfortable quarters were found in the Freemasons' Hotel,\r\nsituated in the Parade, a large square planted with pines. Here, to our\r\nsurprise, we met an Austrian, attending as waiter, who had been driven by\r\nthe wild waves of the late revolution into the wide world, until he met\r\nwith a peaceful existence at the Cape of Storms!\r\n\r\nFavoured by introductions to the most eminent men of science, who received\r\nus in the most friendly way, we succeeded, in the course of a few weeks,\r\nin acquiring rich and valuable scientific collections, and forming\r\nimportant connections for the future supply of our museums. A most cordial\r\nreception was accorded us by Mr. Julius Mosenthal, the Austrian Consul,\r\nand the head of one of the leading mercantile firms of the colony. In his\r\nhospitable house, German music and German song made us entirely forget\r\nthat we were sojourning thousands of miles from home at the southernmost\r\npoint of Africa.\r\n\r\nCape Town is oblong in plan, with long wide streets, intersecting at right\r\nangles. It is destitute of imposing buildings; a commercial place, with\r\npretty dwelling-houses, built in the English style and comfortably\r\nfurnished, all of a light brown hue, owing to the dust, which, in\r\nsouth-east or north-west winds, envelopes the town in whirling clouds, and\r\nmay indeed be considered the only plague of this healthy delightful\r\nclimate. The English element, which, with the stereotyped customs of its\r\nlife and its equitable laws, possesses, wherever it obtains a footing, so\r\npowerful an influence, has almost entirely superseded the Dutch, which\r\ncontinues to exist only in the lonely farmhouses far in the interior.\r\nThere is scarcely anything remaining to indicate that Cape Town was\r\nfounded by the Dutch; and were it not for the yellow Malay faces, with\r\ntheir gaudy head-coverings or umbrella-shaped straw hats, and the tawny\r\nmestizoes, who remind us of the aboriginal inhabitants, and give a\r\ncompletely foreign colouring, one might easily fancy one's self to be in\r\nan old English provincial town. Generally speaking, any one arriving here\r\nwith preconceived notions of finding himself amongst Hottentots and\r\nBushmen, or in a state of society differing materially from that of\r\nEurope, will soon discover that he has been entirely mistaken. The\r\naborigines whom Jan van Riebeck found, when, with three Dutch ships, he\r\nlanded in 1652 at Table Bay, and in the name of the Dutch East India\r\nCompany established a settlement, have now almost entirely disappeared\r\nfrom the capital. If any one desires to see a veritable Hottentot or\r\nBushman, he must undertake a troublesome journey, of weeks' duration, into\r\nthe inhospitable interior. In Cape Town this singular race is only now and\r\nthen to be met with in prisons or hospitals, and even then of a mixed\r\nbreed.\r\n\r\nThe colony has now a population of 280,000 white and coloured inhabitants,\r\nof whom about 30,000 live in Cape Town; half of these are whites, and\r\nprobably not more than 1000 form the higher and influential class. There\r\ncan be no doubt that when, in 1815, the English took possession of the\r\nCape, a firm foundation had been laid already by the Dutch 150 years\r\nbefore; but the real progress of the country, and the development of its\r\nnatural resources, date only from the commencement of British rule, by\r\nwhich those shackles were thrown off with which the narrow-minded colonial\r\npolicy of the Dutch had fettered this settlement, like all others that\r\nowned their sway.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Colony since 1850 has possessed a Legislative Council of 15\r\nmembers, and a House of Assembly of 40 deputies. The executive power rests\r\nin the hands of the Governor-General, appointed by the British Government.\r\nAll bills passed by this parliament require the royal assent before they\r\nbecome law.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak in too high and eulogistic terms of Sir George\r\nGrey, whom we had the happiness at the time of our stay to find in the\r\nimportant position of Governor-General of the colony. Owing to the wisdom\r\nwith which Sir George governed this important colony, he gained for\r\nhimself the love and admiration of the people to such an extent that,\r\nafter the expiration of the regularly fixed period of his office as\r\nGovernor, they petitioned the Queen of England for his re-appointment. Sir\r\nGeorge is not only an able statesman, but also a sound scholar, possessing\r\na most complete collection of books and manuscripts on the Australian,\r\nPolynesian and African languages, and he is a most zealous patron of the\r\nnumerous scientific institutions of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical observatory, under the superintendence of Mr. Maclear,\r\nhas preserved the celebrity which it attained by the great work on the\r\nconstellations of the southern hemisphere, the materials for which were\r\ncollected by Sir John Herschel during his residence here some twenty years\r\nsince. There is now a transit instrument, which in accuracy excels even\r\nthat of the Observatory at Greenwich, and which is said to have cost\r\nupwards of _£_2000.\r\n\r\nThe South African Museum, containing collections of natural history, is\r\nnow under the superintendence of Mr. L. Layard (brother of the celebrated\r\ninvestigator of Nineveh). This institution, as well as the South African\r\npublic library, the literary, scientific, and mechanics' institutions,\r\nbesides nearly fifty other establishments and societies for religious,\r\nbenevolent and industrial purposes, owe their foundation and flourishing\r\ncondition to the public spirit and the charitable disposition of the\r\ninhabitants of the colony. In 69 schools scattered over its surface,\r\nupwards of 18,000 pupils are educated according to a system introduced in\r\n1841 by Sir John Herschel.\r\n\r\nThe Botanical Gardens, likewise founded and kept up by private\r\nsubscription, are not only a most agreeable resort, but also afford much\r\ninstruction, arising from the many interesting and useful plants gathered\r\nhere from all quarters of the world. To those which are adapted for\r\ncultivation in the sandy plains of the Cape, great attention is devoted.\r\nSome of them have been found available in forming as it were vegetable\r\nwalls of protection against the inroads of the sand, so destructive to all\r\ncultivation. As particularly serviceable for this purpose, were mentioned\r\nto us _Fabricia variegata_, a sea-shore shrub of from 6 to 10 feet high;\r\n_Protea myrtifera_; the so-called Hottentot fig: _Mesembryanthemum\r\nedulis_; and the Cape wax-myrtle _Myricacordifolia_;--all these are found\r\nto thrive in the sand without cultivation, put a stop to its ravages, and\r\nin some respects may be considered as the pioneers of all other plants,\r\nwhich do not thrive before the sandy soil has been prepared for them. Nay,\r\nsingularly enough, some of these (as for instance the Hottentot fig),\r\nbecome extinct as soon as others make their appearance, just in the same\r\nway as the pioneer of civilization, the backwoodsman in the west of the\r\nUnited States, leaves his lonely blockhouse and hurries on as soon as\r\novertaken by the peaceful settler. The wax-berry shrub is also otherwise\r\nuseful to the inhabitants; from its berries a substance is prepared well\r\nsuited for making candles. According to a treatise on its culture two\r\nworkmen are able to realize with a defecator daily 100 lbs. of white wax\r\nfrom the berries gathered by six persons. The expense of labour, &c., does\r\nnot exceed 18_s._ per 100 lbs., or about 2_d._ per pound. A large quantity\r\nof this vegetable substance has lately been sent to London, where it is\r\nsaid to have met with a profitable market. In the Botanical Garden of Cape\r\nTown we first met the two celebrated grasses known as _Holcus Caffrorum_\r\nand _Holcus saccharatum_, which, by their usefulness in domestic life,\r\nhave more extensively, and perhaps quickly, than any other plant, spread\r\nover the world. We are indebted to the Secretary of the Board of Public\r\nRoads, W. De Smidt, Esq., for some seeds of these and other plants, as\r\nalso to Mr. McGibbon, manager of the Botanical Gardens, for similar\r\nfavours.\r\n\r\nConsidering the deficiency of labour, and the large sections of fertile\r\nland as yet uncultivated in the colony, Sir George Grey has directed great\r\nattention to the immigration of German emigrants of respectable\r\ncharacters, of all trades, as well as those attached to agricultural\r\npursuits. The plan adopted is an excellent and thoroughly honest one.\r\nEvery emigrant, if single, obtains from the Government thirty acres of\r\ngood land, and, if married, fifty; five for each child above one, and ten\r\nfor every one exceeding ten years of age. The rate of the land is to be\r\nfixed by Government at a fair and reasonable sum, and, together with the\r\npassage-money, to be paid four years after the location of the emigrant,\r\nin five annual instalments. From the moment the colonist steps on African\r\nground he is an independent owner of land, although not entitled to sell\r\nhis property until his obligations to the Government are liquidated. The\r\nlocal parliament has granted a sum of _£_50,000 to promote emigration. The\r\nCape probably offers to an industrious emigrant a more advantageous field\r\nfor active energy than any other country in the world. Some of the German\r\ncolonists, the remnant of the British Legion engaged in the Crimean war,\r\nwho, under General Stuttersheim, have settled in British Caffraria, are\r\nthriving prosperously. They are the first pioneers of the German element\r\nin South Africa, and, under the protection of a liberal and free\r\ngovernment, are increasing in number annually in consequence of the\r\nfavourable reports which they transmit to their native country.\r\n\r\nAn emigration of a peculiar kind has unexpectedly taken place. An impostor\r\namongst the Caffres, who had assumed the character of a prophet,\r\npronounced the end of the world as imminent, in consequence of which large\r\nnumbers of them slaughtered their cattle and left their fields\r\nuncultivated. Being thus, in a short time, reduced to a state of perfect\r\ndestitution, not less than 19,000 of starving Caffres sought help and an\r\nasylum in the British territory during the year 1857, and before its close\r\nthe number had increased to 30,000. The colonial Government, out of\r\nconsideration to the welfare of the colonists, admitted only those Caffres\r\nwho bound themselves to act as servants, for at least one year, at\r\nreasonable wages, and in order to prevent any danger arising from being\r\ncongregated in too large numbers, they were located by the Government\r\nofficers in various detached parts of the colony.\r\n\r\nA very active society of philanthropists exists here, under the title of\r\n\"The Committee of Emigration from Holland.\" Its object is to bring over\r\norphans and children of the poor from the overpopulated Dutch provinces.\r\nThese useful emigrants are partly located as apprentices to farmers, and\r\nremain until they are of age under the care of the Committee. During our\r\nstay a party of seventy boys and girls just arrived from Holland\r\nassembled, with their conductors, in one of the large avenues of the\r\nBotanical Garden, to be inspected by the Governor-General. They all looked\r\nhealthy and cheerful, and seemed to have but little suffered from the\r\nfatigues of a long voyage. When Sir George Grey made his appearance the\r\nchildren sang the English National Anthem, translated into Dutch, and\r\nafterwards the sweet, affectionate song, \"When the swallows homewards\r\nfly.\" Some young emigrants, who, two years ago, had come under similar\r\ncircumstances from Holland, had already obtained good situations, and\r\ngreeted their little compatriots most heartily. Being asked if they wished\r\nto return to Holland, they replied, without the slightest hesitation, in\r\nthe negative, declaring that they felt very happy where they were,--an\r\nannouncement of course peculiarly agreeable to the new-comers.\r\n\r\nAn interesting opportunity was afforded to us of seeing a large number of\r\nCaffres, of both sexes, who had been brought in as prisoners in\r\nconsequence of having made predatory incursions into the British\r\nterritory. They all arrived in a state of nudity, and in most wretched\r\nplight, but were immediately provided with European clothes--blue striped\r\nshirts, sheepskin trousers, shoes, a Scotch cap, and a blanket which\r\nserved during the day as a cloak, and at night as a covering. Their food\r\nwas tolerably good, but their abode during night, in the damp casemates of\r\nthe fort, seemed not to agree with them, and many were visibly in a\r\ndiseased state of health. Nearly all were muscular, and some were really\r\nspecimens of manly beauty. Not one of them knew his age. Their only mode\r\nof calculating is by certain important events, as by the death of a\r\nchieftain, or the various wars with the English. The superintendent, Mr.\r\nWalsh, a very obliging Irishman, had the kindness to cause them to perform\r\nsome of their national dances, wild exercises which served the purpose of\r\nexciting their warlike spirit. The first dance they performed they called\r\n\"Ukutenga.\" Six handsomely-built dancers advanced, whilst about thirty men\r\nclosed in a circle around them, and, by their howlings and clapping of\r\nhands, formed as it were a musical accompaniment to this singular\r\nperformance. The dancers sighed, groaned, hissed, and made the most\r\nextravagant grimaces and contortions, in order to arouse in themselves an\r\nartificial excitement. One, a lad twelve years of age, engaged so\r\nearnestly in the sports, that he perspired from his whole body. There is\r\nanother dance, called \"Tklombo,\" performed in the presence of diseased\r\npersons whilst the quack doctor practises his deceptive remedies; and a\r\nthird, called \"Umduta,\" which is only practised at weddings and other\r\nfestive occasions. This last seemed to be the most characteristic. The\r\nsemi-nude, slender men hopped, their arms clung together, in ranks of six,\r\nhissing with scorn, occasionally uttering a cry, then suddenly separating\r\nand marching one after the other in slow time, in a circle, uttering the\r\nmost singular sounds. Now they bent forward the whole upper part of the\r\nbody, and then back again, each of them making the same violent gestures\r\nas in the former dance, and pronouncing some words to excite their\r\ncompanions, such as, \"Be active!\" \"Be alert!\" until they all trembled and\r\nbecame fearfully and feverishly excited. The surrounding Caffres, who were\r\nat first mere spectators, by degrees were seized with this singular\r\ndancing mania, till at last the entire number, as if stung by a tarantula,\r\nlashed themselves into a wild and apparently ungovernable frenzy. The\r\ngreat difference in the colour of the skin of these Caffres was\r\nparticularly striking, as they evidently belong to one and the same race.\r\nFrom the blackness of coal to bronze, all tints and shades were observed,\r\nand one of them, called \"Ngduba\" (Sea-shell), appeared to be even of a\r\nreddish yellow. He belonged to the tribe of the Fingoes, and said that\r\nboth his parents were of the same colour.\r\n\r\nThe governor permitted five young Caffres to be engaged on board the\r\n_Novara_, with their own consent, as apprentices, and although they were\r\nprisoners sentenced for several years, yet the Government took every care\r\nto secure their welfare. An agreement was signed to provide that their\r\nreturn, should they desire it, might be facilitated in every possible way.\r\nFaithful subjects could not be cared for with more anxiety than were these\r\nlegally-sentenced Caffre prisoners by the colonial Government. Two of them\r\nwent one day on shore, during our stay at Auckland, in New Zealand, and\r\nnever came back; the other three made the whole voyage with the _Novara_,\r\nand are now sailors on board the imperial yacht _Fancy_. They, of course,\r\nunderstood, at their embarkation, only their own singular mother-tongue;\r\nyet the chaplain of the expedition, the Rev. E. Marochini, after having\r\nmade himself acquainted with their idiom, succeeded in instructing these\r\nblack youths, by means of their own language, in the doctrines of\r\nChristianity, and, by degrees, imparted some knowledge of the Italian and\r\nGerman languages, the happy results of these endeavours being a complete\r\nvocabulary and a small catechism in the Caffre language, which the\r\nreverend gentlemen composed during the voyage; and such progress did his\r\nthree pupils make, that, on our return to Trieste, they were so far\r\nprepared as to be fit for reception, by baptism, into the Christian\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIn the house of correction there were a number of female Caffres who had\r\nbeen made prisoners at the same time with their brothers and husbands,\r\nsome belonging to the family of chiefs. One, the sister of the chieftain\r\nSandilli, was a handsome, tall and slender woman, with mild features and\r\npiercing small black eyes; another, by the name of Mnovenkeli, the sister\r\nof the chieftain Mkoseni, was an imposing and earnest-looking figure.\r\nSeveral of these women bore a long stripe tattooed on their breasts as an\r\nornament. Several were deficient of a little finger of the left hand: this\r\nmutilation is the effect of superstition, as it often occurs that, in case\r\nof the severe illness of the child, the distressed mother causes a finger\r\nof her offspring to be cut off and sacrificed to the evil spirit, in order\r\nthat the rest of the body may be saved and permitted by the evil spirit to\r\nrecover.\r\n\r\nOne of these young Caffre women had her child wrapped up in a piece of\r\nlinen tied to her back, and endeavoured to lull it to sleep by continually\r\nmoving the left elbow, by which the baby was kept in a swinging motion,\r\nand an effect was produced like that of a cradle. Various questions were\r\nput, through an interpreter, to several of these females, who, after their\r\ntimidity was overcome, answered with great readiness. Polygamy is said to\r\nprevail amongst them. Many women have from ten to twelve children. The\r\nchildren are suckled sometimes from two to three years. A numerous progeny\r\nis the pride of a family. As a proof of the legitimacy of a child, there\r\nis said to exist a kind of milk trial. Notwithstanding considerable\r\ntrouble in endeavouring to procure information, we were unable to obtain a\r\nvery lucid idea of this singular experiment: it consists in the father\r\ngiving the infant, in the bottom of his hand, directly after its birth,\r\nsome cow's milk to drink, and if the child refuses the draught it is\r\nconsidered illegitimate. Caffre women very rarely salute their husbands\r\nwith a kiss, except after a long separation, and even then only on the\r\ncheek--never on the lips.\r\n\r\nIn the ethnographical part a detailed description will be presented of\r\nthis most peculiar race, of whom the Bushmen are evidently only a decrepid\r\nbranch. Here it will suffice to observe that a girl, only sixteen years of\r\nage, was noticed, whose father was a degenerate Hottentot, and whose\r\nmother was a Bushwoman. The girl measured 4 feet 6 1/2 inches, and weighed\r\n75lbs. Another Bushwoman, thirty years of age, measured 4 feet 9 inches.\r\nAll the individuals we saw of this race were remarkable for their\r\nexceedingly small hands and feet.\r\n\r\nOne week of our stay at the Cape was devoted to an excursion into the\r\ninterior. On the 1st October, early in the morning, we left Cape Town in a\r\nlight two-wheeled vehicle, drawn by four horses--a turn-out which\r\ncertainly seemed better suited for a drive in Hyde Park than a journey,\r\nhowever short, in South Africa: for who would suppose that the principal\r\nroads on the southernmost point of the most unknown quarter of the globe,\r\nare, in consequence of English civilization and the geognostic nature of\r\nthe ground, in a better condition than most bye-roads in the civilized\r\nstates of Europe? For a country where labour is so deficient and\r\nexpensive, such enormous works could only be executed by means of\r\ncompulsory labour: in this respect the high-roads and mountain passes of\r\nthe Cape afford the most evident proofs of how much more beneficially and\r\nusefully convicts may be employed in colonial works than in allowing them\r\nto rot within prison walls, alike a burden to themselves and to society.\r\n\r\nOnly ten years ago the streets of Cape Town looked at least highly\r\ndangerous, and the steep rugged old roads, which sometimes run parallel\r\nwith the new ones, evince very clearly the great difference between bygone\r\ndays and the present, as regards the internal communications of the\r\ncolony. The uncultivated state of the country formerly, which indeed, in\r\nsome parts, continues even yet to exist, is the cause of the ancient\r\ncustom having been retained of placing before every vehicle, however\r\nlightly laden, sixteen to twenty powerful oxen, even on perfectly level\r\nroads. All longer journeys into the interior are undertaken in heavy\r\nwaggon-like vehicles, exclusively drawn by oxen. As a family is sometimes\r\ncompelled to take up abode in such waggons for weeks together, they are\r\ncompletely covered and provided with all possible conveniences; indeed, it\r\nis a sort of locomotive house. The waggon, which much resembles the\r\ngoods-trucks used on European railways, is at least 18 feet long, and the\r\nentire length of the set-out, including the oxen, embraces not less than\r\nfrom 120 to 180 feet. It may readily be imagined how such a custom impedes\r\nspeedy intercourse, and how much more usefully a great part of the animal\r\npower might be employed. On the excursion from Cape Town to Stellenbosch,\r\na small place only ten miles distant, we met more than 100 waggons, of\r\nwhich not one had less than ten, and many double that number of oxen, so\r\nthat at least 1500 heads of cattle were employed in a work which might\r\neasily have been performed by a third part of the number.\r\n\r\nThe coachman was a Malay, and wore that singular screen-formed straw hat,\r\nwhich so peculiarly distinguishes the male population of his race. These\r\nmen have the reputation of being particularly skilful drivers, and thus\r\nform a considerable portion of the coachmen of the place. The Malay driver\r\nhad an assistant by his side, who seemed, however, chiefly to serve as\r\nballast, in order that our two-wheeled vehicle might not lose its\r\nequilibrium; for the disconsolate condition of the horses rendered the\r\nfear of their running away quite superfluous. Our charioteer drove his\r\nhorses, which now and then were rather restive, with so much adroitness,\r\nthat we arrived as early as nine o'clock in that charming settlement\r\nStellenbosch, which Wilkes, the American Commodore, even in 1839,\r\ndesignated as the loveliest and most beautiful in the whole colony. It has\r\ncompletely preserved the aspect of a little Dutch town; the streets are\r\nstraight and wide, adorned with avenues of oaks, many centuries old; the\r\nhouses are extremely tidy and clean, and are built in the genuine Dutch\r\nstyle. There is no trace of English influence perceptible. Its 4000\r\ninhabitants mostly speak Dutch, and cultivate the vine, grain, and fruit.\r\nNo country town seen in the whole course of our long voyage made a deeper\r\nimpression, or left more pleasing recollections, than Stellenbosch. The\r\noccasion of our visit was certainly of an uncommonly cheerful and festive\r\ncharacter. On the day of our arrival the Governor was about to review a\r\ncorps of volunteers, raised in Cape Town and its neighbourhood, to supply\r\nthe place of the regular troops about to be dispatched to the Indian\r\nbattle-fields. Extraordinary enthusiasm and interest was manifested\r\neverywhere in the military movements. Thousands of visitors had assembled\r\neven from great distances to witness this novel national spectacle. The\r\nGovernor had proclaimed the day as a general holiday; all shops were\r\nclosed; the streets presented an extremely animated appearance, and in\r\nfront of every house was a crowd. The Austrian Consul had been kind enough\r\nto favour us with a letter of introduction to one of the first families in\r\nthe place; but, taking into consideration the general bustle and continual\r\narrival of strangers, we were much afraid of being, at this moment, very\r\nunwelcome guests, as every nook and corner would already be occupied; for\r\nin this colony visitors do not come, as with us, for a short time, and\r\nwithout encumbrance, but with waggons, horses, servants, household and\r\nall, regularly to settle down for an indefinite period.\r\n\r\nOur own party consisted of five persons provided with four horses, and we\r\nwere now, for want of other lodgings, about to claim the hospitality of\r\nMynheer Van Schultze. A pretty, youthful, rosy-cheeked lady, who appeared\r\nat the door, took--not without some embarrassment--our letter of\r\nintroduction, and disappeared with it into the interior of the stately\r\nhouse. We were requested to enter, and were shown into a suite of very\r\nneat rooms, and were received, not merely with great politeness, but with\r\nthe heartiest welcome.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock we drove out with our hospitable friend, Mynheer Van\r\nSchultze, to the review, which took place on the common in the\r\nneighbourhood of the village. The number of spectators was probably twenty\r\ntimes greater than that of the volunteers; they had surrounded the ground\r\nwith a wall of carriages, on the tops of which women and children were\r\ngrouped in every picturesque attitude. The rifle volunteers marched, with\r\nthe Governor, Sir George Grey, at their head, and preceded by a band, to\r\nthe ground. There might have been about 300 cavalry and 200 infantry, with\r\nseveral pieces of artillery. They all looked very well; their uniform was\r\nplain and remarkably suitable for the purpose, consisting of tunics and\r\ntrousers of black cloth with metal buttons, and a common cap with a silver\r\nornament. They went through the usual man[oe]uvres, whilst a good deal of\r\ngunpowder was expended. The evolutions of the cavalry were executed with\r\nwonderful precision, a result due chiefly to the circumstance that, at the\r\nCape, every inhabitant is a good equestrian, and is trained from childhood\r\nto manage a horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIFLE VOLUNTEER _FÊTE_ AT STELLENBOSCH.]\r\n\r\nThe review finished, a breakfast was served at the Drosdy, or\r\nMunicipality, on long tables, in a magnificent avenue of oak trees;\r\nnearly 600 volunteers and many other guests sat down, whilst in the\r\nback-ground a large number of ladies and gentlemen were present as\r\nspectators. The presence of some members of the Novara Expedition at the\r\nfestival led the Burgomaster, after the toast of the Queen was given, to\r\npropose the health of the Emperor of Austria, prefacing it with various\r\nlaudatory remarks on the Expedition. The toast was most heartily received,\r\nthe whole company raising their glasses, whilst the band performed the\r\nAustrian national anthem. The officer to whose lot it fell to return\r\nthanks, said:--\"That he felt deeply gratified with the honour done to his\r\ncountry and nation by the enthusiasm with which the health of his\r\nsovereign had been received by so distinguished an assembly, and that he\r\ncould not forbear expressing his admiration and delight in observing the\r\nprosperous condition of this fine country, which, like all others where\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon race was predominant, was blessed with freedom, with the\r\nspirit of progress, and the blessings of Christianity;\" and he concluded\r\nby proposing \"Old England for ever.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day after the review the journey was pursued early in the morning\r\nto the village of Paarl (Pearl), about four hours distant. We had come as\r\nstrangers to the hospitable Stellenbosch, and left as old friends, the\r\nentire family accompanying us to the carriage, and the worthy old mother\r\nof our amiable host, a thoroughly genuine Dutch matron, was visibly\r\ntouched on taking leave of those whom, in all probability, she would never\r\nsee more.\r\n\r\nOn the route to Paarl several immensely large ant-hills were met with,\r\nsome of which measured from two to two-and-a-half feet in diameter, by\r\nabout three feet high. The insects were partly black and partly of a\r\ngreyish-brown colour, and must be very troublesome to the farmers.\r\n\r\nPaarl, an extremely neat village, consists of a single long street, and\r\ncontains nearly 4000 inhabitants, chiefly occupied in the growth of the\r\nvine. They are the descendants of those French Protestants who, at the\r\nclose of the 17th century, left their native country in consequence of\r\nreligious persecution. All the detached farm-yards were extremely neat,\r\nand bore evidence of the wealth of their owners. Nothing reminds one of\r\nAfrica and the neighbourhood of Hottentots, Bushmen, or Caffres. The\r\nlandscape becomes grander the more the mountains, 4000 to 5000 feet high,\r\nare approached. Among them lies the little town of Wellington, charmingly\r\nsituated; though but a few years in existence, and numbering only 2000\r\ninhabitants, it has already a joint-stock bank with a capital of £45,000,\r\nseveral schools, and some neat places of worship. While taking an evening\r\nstroll, we passed a well-lighted Reformed Dutch Church, from the interior\r\nof which the devotional tones of a pious Christian congregation floating\r\nthrough the night air, died away among the mountains.\r\n\r\nSingular to say, the small, and, one would think, essentially prosaic and\r\npractical little town of Wellington boasts a quack doctor, named Brabna,\r\nwhom the common people, far and near, come to consult, more, one would\r\nimagine, to be relieved of their money than their ailments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAINE'S KLOEF AS IT WAS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAINE'S KLOEF AS IT IS.]\r\n\r\nThe route to Worcester, whither we set out the following morning, leads\r\nat first through the wide, highly-cultivated Waggonmakers' Valley, adorned\r\nwith numbers of rich farm-steads (so named from a number of artisans of\r\nthis handicraft having settled here in former times), after which it\r\npasses over the difficult pass called Paine's Kloef, 4000 feet high, which\r\nfrequently recalled the well-known road over the Sömmering Alp, or that at\r\nOptschina. This mountain-pass, first completed in 1853, by the engineer,\r\nMr. Paine, greatly facilitates the traffic between Cape Town and this\r\nfertile district, which previously was quite inaccessible, and whose\r\nimmense natural resources are only now beginning to be developed.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the highest point of the pass we found a strong south-east\r\nwind blowing. The thermometer marked 55° F., and when plunged in a spring\r\nthat issued from the mountain close at hand, 48°. South-east winds are\r\nespecially prevalent here, particularly in summer, when they frequently\r\ncause serious damage; hence all the upper branches of the trees incline to\r\nthe north-west.\r\n\r\nWe now came to the finest bridge in the country, named Darling Bridge,\r\nafter a late governor, which is thrown across the broad stream called by\r\nthe Dutch, Breede River, and by the English, Broad River, a frequent\r\nsource of error. The English colonists are bent upon driving out the Dutch\r\nnames of rivers and localities, and supplying them with new names of\r\nEnglish origin. The Dutch, however, hold on obstinately to the names they\r\nhave been accustomed to, and continue to use the ancient nomenclature.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Darling Bridge is a farm where the traveller can\r\nbe comfortably accommodated, and from which, being a post-station, letters\r\ncan be forwarded to all parts of the country. It has regular communication\r\nwith the rest of the colony three times a week. The vehicle, however, in\r\nwhich the letters and packets are forwarded, in consequence of the\r\nwretched roads in the interior, and with the view of expediting the\r\ntransmission of mail matter, is simply a light, open, eminently\r\nuncomfortable, two-wheel waggon, in which but one passenger can be taken\r\neach trip. Day and night, up hill and down dale, it continues its journey,\r\nchanging driver and horses every two hours, only the unfortunate\r\npassenger being condemned to remain glued to the jolting uncomfortable\r\ncar, until he has attained the end of his journey. We were told of an\r\nEnglish captain, who once travelled on urgent business 400 miles in fifty\r\nhours in this fashion, and arrived at his destination in such a pitiable\r\nplight, that he had to be lifted from the car and put to bed forthwith,\r\nwhich he kept for several weeks, before he was able to get about again.\r\nUnfortunately, we were not told whether this unlucky passenger returned to\r\nCape Town by a similar conveyance.\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room of the farm we made acquaintance with several families\r\nfrom Graaf Reinet, in the north of the colony, who were _en route_ for\r\nCape Town, and had been already three weeks on the road, during which they\r\nmust have passed every night in their unwieldy waggon, or under tents.\r\nThere was also among the assembled travellers a Quaker Missionary, of\r\nWorcester, who was on his way to the opening of the Spiritual Synod at\r\nCape Town, and who was so kind as to furnish us, on the spot, with some\r\nintroductions to his friends in Worcester, a lovely little town, which we\r\nreached towards the evening. There are places which charm at the first\r\nglance, just as there are many men who take us by storm as it were.\r\nWorcester is one of these; so neat, so clean, with a pretty garden in\r\nfront of each little house, every wall of which was entwined with roses,\r\nand in the back-ground all around, bare, but picturesque groups of lofty\r\nhills of a blueish-grey tint, which imparted to the entire landscape a\r\npeculiar and almost magical colouring. Worcester, a creation of\r\nyesterday, has about 4500 inhabitants, chiefly employed in vine growing\r\nand sheep pasture. There are some of the peasantry here who own flocks of\r\n3000 to 4000 sheep! The rich vegetation of the valley has an eminently\r\nnorthern character. Alongside of oaks, pines, poplars, willows, will\r\nappear a tree of Australian origin, of the order of Myrtaceæ, the blue\r\ngum-tree (_Eucalyptus Globulus_), which, on account of its rapid growth,\r\nis planted before each door for the purpose of shade. One of these trees\r\nwas shown to us of but four years' growth, the stem of which was already\r\ntwenty feet high! The leaves have a highly aromatic odour, and must be\r\nespecially suitable for the extraction of oil, as the rind is full of\r\ncamphor; as yet, however, the tree is not used by the colonists for any\r\nother purpose than to supply shade to their gardens.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising what comfort the traveller encounters among these new\r\nsettlements, from which, even already, all traces have been eradicated of\r\nthe difficulties that originally beset the colonist; so that at every turn\r\none meets with evidences of the highest European civilization. Whenever,\r\nindeed, he finds himself at a settlement, he will remark that it is not\r\nmerely provided with the necessaries of life, or the mere products of the\r\nsoil, but that it sparkles with numerous objects of luxury and refined\r\ntaste; such as handsome furniture, pianos, and other musical instruments,\r\nengravings, English classics, besides telescopes, barometers,\r\nthermometers, and other similar evidences of high cultivation. At the\r\nhotel at Worcester, we met with a degree of comfort such as is found only\r\nin the chief cities of Europe. Several of the inhabitants, among others\r\nDr. Esselin, a missionary of the Moravian brotherhood, and Dr. Meynard, of\r\nthe Episcopal Church, laid us under particular obligations by their\r\nparticipation in the objects of our inquiry. The latter gentleman sought\r\nus out at our hotel, and, after a hearty welcome, remarked that he\r\npossessed, in his collection, several highly interesting petrifactions\r\nfrom Beaufort, about 400 miles north-west of Worcester. We satisfied\r\nourselves, however, by a visit which we paid to Dr. Meynard at his own\r\nhouse, that his collection was far from possessing the interest he claimed\r\nfor it. In all probability, however, judging by what we heard, Beaufort\r\nmust be a classic soil for the palæontologist, as there are numberless\r\nfossils in that district, especially of reptiles. In like manner, the\r\nstalactite grottoes, known as \"The Congo Caves,\" 300 miles from Worcester,\r\nhave never yet been scientifically examined or described.\r\n\r\nDr. Esselin, who is a native of Hesse, was so kind as to accompany the\r\nnaturalists of the Novara Expedition to the hot springs of Brand Vley the\r\nfollowing morning. The road thither, which lies through a valley partly\r\noverflowed towards the end of the rainy season, was exceedingly trying to\r\nthe horses, and, but for the kind offices of Dr. Esselin, who was\r\nacquainted with the difficulties of the route, and undertook the guidance\r\nof the waggon through the constantly recurring swamps and morasses, we\r\nshould in all probability have had to retrace our steps halfway, or even\r\nhave stuck fast, which would have been a still more serious matter. Only\r\nafter unspeakable exertions did we succeed in threading the valley of\r\nWorcester as far as the shores of Breede (or Broad) River. Several times\r\nwe were compelled, in order to lighten the waggon, to dismount, and wade\r\nup to our knees in water. Once the quag was so deep, that to avoid sinking\r\nin it we had to be carried, one by one, on the back of our Malay driver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSSING THE BREEDE RIVER.]\r\n\r\nOn the bank is the cottage, (_boeren plaats_), of a peasant who avails\r\nhimself of his proximity to convert the stream into a source of profit, by\r\nferrying travellers, who have occasion to pass here during the floods,\r\nacross the river in a small skiff, the waggon and horses being swum across\r\nafterwards. In summer, on the contrary, the stream is readily forded on\r\nhorseback, and is indeed dry at several points. At the period of our visit\r\n(in October, 1857), towards the end of the rainy season, this Breede River\r\nwas about 150 feet wide, and about 28 feet deep, and we accordingly found\r\nourselves compelled to call in the assistance of the ferryman. Under his\r\nsuperintendence the work was gone about quite systematically. First of\r\nall the four horses were swum across, by a halter round the neck; after\r\nwhich the luggage was transported to the opposite bank in a small boat.\r\nLast of all came the waggon, with the travellers therein. It was thought\r\nthat the upper portion of the waggon might be towed across, swimming on\r\nthe surface of the water, by fastening an empty water-tight cask between\r\nthe wheels; the cask, however, proved unequal to the weight. As the waggon\r\nleft the shore it sank deeper and deeper in the water, till about\r\nmid-current it fairly capsized, hardly a spoke of the left wheel reaching\r\nthe opposite bank.\r\n\r\nAmidst our perplexities, a violent shower of rain came on, making the\r\nwaggon leak in every corner, just as we succeeded, after great trouble, in\r\ngetting it to land, and were busy repairing it. Fortunately, every\r\nrequisite precaution had been taken to remedy any such disaster occurring\r\nat this dangerous spot; so that the whole affair, though sufficiently\r\nuncomfortable at the time, left only the recollection of a pleasant\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOT SPRINGS OF BRAND VLEY.]\r\n\r\nAt last, towards noon, we reached the hot springs of Brand Vley, or Brand\r\nValley. This hot spring, which is quite exposed, like a pond or tank, and\r\neven at the least accessible points is adorned with rich vegetation, is\r\nabout 100 feet in circumference, and is of a triangular shape, rounded off\r\nat the corners. Among bananas, ferns, and cacti of all sorts, spring up\r\nnumerous specimens of _Calla Ethioptica_, silver poplars, pines, reeds,\r\nand canes, in wild profusion. Many fruits even, such as pine-apples,\r\nmangoes, rose apples, &c., which as a rule do not flourish at this\r\nelevation, grew all round the edges of the basin. Some twigs of a rose\r\ntree, which, growing luxuriantly in the warmth and moisture, spread across\r\nthe spring, like a green canopy, must have been a second growth of the\r\nsame year. We in fact enjoyed the unusual spectacle of seeing one portion\r\nof the tree in the flush of its utmost beauty, while the upper and more\r\ndistant branches had not as yet put forth their leaves. The water at the\r\nhottest point reached 145° F., while the temperature of the air was 75° F.\r\nIt is remarkably clear, has not the slightest taste, and in many\r\nparticulars greatly resembles the springs of Wildbad Gastein. The number\r\nof patients during the season (October to April) does not exceed from 100\r\nto 150, the waters being chiefly used in chronic maladies, rheumatic\r\naffections, scrofula, erysipelas, cutaneous eruptions, and similar\r\ncomplaints. Immediately adjoining is a small brook, with a temperature of\r\n68° F., which rises at the foot of a neighbouring eminence, and has water\r\nenough during the entire year to keep a mill in constant work.\r\n\r\nThe only animal inhabiting the spring is the larva of a _Tipularia_, which\r\nfrequents one quarter of the pool where the temperature of the water does\r\nnot exceed 113°.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of August, 1857, two shocks of an earthquake were felt in\r\nrapid succession in Brand Valley, of such violence as to arouse the\r\ninhabitants out of their sleep, when several of the smaller houses were\r\nfound to have rents and fissures in their walls. The proprietor of the\r\nbath alleged that the shocks in Brand Valley were much more severe than at\r\nWorcester, although that town is but six miles distant.\r\n\r\nAt Brand Valley we took leave of our hospitable companion, Dr. Esselin,\r\nwho presented us with several books on leaving, and set out on an\r\nexcursion to the mission of the Moravian Brethren in Genaaden Dal, in the\r\ndistrict of Caledon. _En route_ we encountered several families, who came\r\nfrom far in the interior of Cape Colony, driving before them enormous\r\nherds of oxen, some of which were yoked to the waggons that formed the\r\ncaravan, these being fitted up something like dwelling-houses on wheels.\r\nAs night fell, a halt would be called at some selected spot, when the\r\ndraught oxen were unharnessed, a fire lit in the open air, and the evening\r\nrepast prepared. Horses are very rarely used on long journeys, although\r\nthese are in consequence seriously lengthened thereby, especially as it is\r\nthe custom all over the country to unyoke every two or three hours, so as\r\nto allow the beasts to enjoy a roll on the ground, if only for a few\r\nminutes at a time.\r\n\r\nAs neither of our drivers was acquainted with the road we were now to\r\npursue, we hired a black guide from Brand Valley, who accompanied us on\r\nhorseback as far as the next farm-house, where we were to pass the night.\r\nJust as one requires a pilot to take a ship into an insecure or unknown\r\nharbour, so we now had to avail ourselves of the services of this limber\r\nyoung negro, who was an excellent rider, in piloting us through the\r\nendless morasses and pools of water. Renden was the name of the solitary\r\nfarm (the property of Mr. Pretorius, a landed proprietor, to whom we had\r\nletters of introduction), where we were to pass the night.\r\n\r\nAs we approached, we were saluted with the loud barking of a hound that\r\nhad been unchained, and who seemed ready to rush upon his unexpected prey,\r\nso that we hardly dared to advance one step. At last a man made his\r\nappearance at the door of the house, with a lantern in his hand, speedily\r\nfollowed by the whole family, anxious to learn who could be in the\r\nneighbourhood at so late an hour. We handed him the letter, which we\r\nbegged him to read, and requested to know whether we could be received for\r\nthe night. We were at once admitted, and speedily found a most cordial\r\nwelcome. We were shown into apartments very plainly furnished, but neat,\r\nand scrupulously clean, after which we were invited to join the household\r\nat supper. It was a very numerous family. The father and mother, genuine\r\nDutch figures, sat at the head of a long table; next to whom sat the\r\nson-in-law, who had married the eldest daughter, and then commingled with\r\neach other, the sons and daughters that were as yet unmarried. They all\r\nseemed hearty and healthy, and their indurated hands were the best\r\ndiploma of their industry. The youngest son said a short prayer; after\r\nwhich venison, potatoes, mutton, vegetables, bread, butter, and cheese\r\nwere set down in huge dishes, besides which two bottles of Cape wine, of\r\ntheir own manufacture, went the round of the table. Although this place\r\nhad been only settled four years previously, an immense deal had been\r\nalready accomplished by this stirring, cheerful family to make the soil\r\nthoroughly productive, and render the house habitable. Even a small garden\r\nhad been laid out in front of the dwelling-house.\r\n\r\nThe chief article of cultivation in the valley is the grape, for wine\r\nmanufacture, which must in this place return a very handsome profit.\r\n\r\nFrom Renden to Genaaden Dal is a four-hours' journey. The road passes by\r\nDonker's Hoek, a tolerably high mountain, to ascend the summit of which\r\ncost our horses some strenuous exertion, although we marched a\r\nconsiderable distance on foot. A wide belt of sandstone formation\r\npresented a marvellous display of flowers, and gave us in little an idea\r\nof the South African Karroos, a series of terraced clay-patches, estimated\r\nat from 3000 to 4000 feet high, which, hard and steppe-like in the dry\r\nseason, are speedily transformed in the rainy season into smiling,\r\nflower-bespangled plains, quite sponge-like under foot, and rich in\r\nalkaline products.[52] We advanced some six hours before reaching another\r\nfarm-house. This was known as Kleene Islea Plaats (Little Island Farm),\r\nnear which flows the Zonderend River (River Without End), the property of\r\na kind and hospitable family of French extraction, whose parents emigrated\r\nhither from France during the revolution in 1793. As it was Sunday, the\r\nservants had gone to church, so they could only offer us cold mutton,\r\nsyrup, butter, and bread. Before and after our repast, the devout old lady\r\nof the house put up a short petition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: The English appellation \"Karroo\" seems to be derived from\r\n_Karusa_, signifying \"hard\" in the Hottentot language, and to refer to a\r\nquality appertaining to the clayey substance of which these terraces are\r\ncomposed, by virtue of which the red clay, strongly impregnated with iron,\r\nand mixed with sand, becomes in the dry season as hard as burnt clay.]\r\n\r\nHere, too, we remarked that those born in the country of European parents\r\nare called Africans: only the English form an exception to this rule, and\r\nremain with persistent patriotic obstinacy, \"Englishmen.\"\r\n\r\nThe journey from Kleene Islea Plaats to Genaaden Dal is extremely\r\npicturesque. One first catches sight of this retired Moravian settlement\r\nonly when actually entering the place itself, embowered as it is among\r\nlofty trees. What a surprise, when, still fancying one's self at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the village, on reaching the end of a beautiful\r\nvalley at the entrance to Bavian's Kloef, one sweeps by a circuit into the\r\nvery heart of the settlement. We alighted at what is called \"The\r\nLodgment,\" a house set apart for visitors, and conducted by a brother, in\r\nconformity with the laws of the community.\r\n\r\nThe dwellings of the Hottentots lie scattered among the rising grounds in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and with their poverty-stricken aspect impart a\r\nsomewhat melancholy impression. These are built of loam, low in the roof,\r\nas though intended for a stunted race of men, and rarely have windows, so\r\nthat the door is, generally speaking, the largest aperture in the entire\r\nbuilding. Our Malay driver laughed at them, and called them _oete kripp_\r\n(oxen stalls).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOTTENTOT HUTS AT GENAADENDAL.]\r\n\r\nThere seem to be three distinct kinds of these dwellings, which apparently\r\nindicate so many grades of social and pecuniary consideration among the\r\nresident Hottentot families. The first sort, which consists simply of a\r\nsingle apartment, serving at once for kitchen, work-shop, and sleeping\r\nplace, and receiving air and light through a narrow, low-pitched door-way,\r\nis that most usually met with, and may not unaptly be compared to a\r\nbee-hive. The next class is of a better description, and may at once and\r\ndefinitely be distinguished from the first-mentioned, in so far as it\r\npossesses a second room, which, if dark and windowless, is at any rate\r\npartitioned off, and serves as a sleeping apartment. Finally, the third\r\nkind, which can only be said to be the least poor-looking, consists of\r\none large, almost empty chamber, for occupation during the day, with wings\r\non either side, one of which is used as a kitchen, the other as a\r\nbed-room. The wretched ventilation, and damp, moist location of these\r\nhabitations, combined with the bad quality of food, may be regarded as the\r\nmain causes of the unfavourable state of health of the coloured portion of\r\nthe inhabitants of Genaaden Dal, among whom, especially as regards the\r\nfemale portion, pulmonary complaints are rife.\r\n\r\nWe were provided with letters of introduction to the Superintendent of the\r\nCommunity, Dr. Köbling, as also to the Physician and Pharmaceutist, Dr.\r\nRoser, a Würtemberger by birth, and experienced a most cordial reception.\r\nWe availed ourselves of the last hours of declining day to make an\r\nexcursion to the hills, in the country immediately adjacent, so as to\r\ncommand at a glance the entire colony. The principal buildings, the\r\nChurch, the school, the workshops, the warehouses, and the dwellings of\r\nthe missionaries, are assembled in a quadrangular open place, to which a\r\nnumber of lofty, massive, leafy, venerable oaks impart a sombre, but\r\npoetical, appearance, eminently characteristic of the community. All the\r\nbuildings are of a uniform dingy-grey tint. Close in the rear of these\r\nbuildings is a large garden, which reaches as far as what is called\r\n\"Bavian's Kloef\" (defile), in which, even at present, apes, antelopes, and\r\nzebras, abound. Near the kitchen-garden is the cemetery of the community,\r\nwhich seems to be used by meditative brethren as a favourite resort and\r\npromenade.\r\n\r\nThis settlement, situated at the entrance of a mountain defile, at the\r\nfoot of an immense sandstone range, of from 3000 to 4000 feet high, was\r\nfounded in the year 1787, by a brother of the persuasion, named George\r\nSchmidt, from Moravia, who settled fifty-five miles east of Cape Town,\r\nnear Sargent's River, with a number of Hottentots, whom he began to\r\nconvert to Christianity, and called the station \"Bavian's Kloef.\" From the\r\nyear 1806, the settlement assumed the beautiful name of \"Genaaden Dal\"\r\n(Vale of Benevolence), so exquisitely correspondent with the benevolent\r\nexertions of the brotherhood. It at present numbers 3100 souls, mostly a\r\nrace crossed between Hottentots and Mozambique negroes, of the latter of\r\nwhom a considerable number have settled here since the Slave Emancipation\r\nAct of 1826. The settlers are partly proprietors of the land, partly\r\nartisans, cutlers, waggon-makers, tanners, carpenters, millers, &c. In the\r\nworkshops the most exemplary cleanliness and neatness are imperatively\r\ninsisted on. At the Great Exhibition, held in London in 1851, the\r\nwood-work of the Hottentot carpenters of Genaaden Dal received \"Honourable\r\nMention,\" and this elegant testimonial in recognition of their efforts now\r\nhangs, framed and glazed, in the library hall of the community. It\r\nsomewhat surprised us that the cutlers did not receive, in their section,\r\na similar distinction, since, in that department of industry, the\r\nHottentots produce articles, which, so far as concerns quality and\r\ncheapness, are really astounding. The workpeople receive a fixed weekly\r\npayment, which they may expend as they please. The net proceeds, however,\r\nof the various articles manufactured belong to the community, and are\r\nexpended in defraying the expenses of, and supporting, the mission. The\r\ninhabitants of Genaaden Dal are closely connected, by religious ties, with\r\nthe community; and only those who profess the principles of the Moravian\r\nbrotherhood are permitted to settle among them.\r\n\r\nThe field-labourers, who hire themselves out to labour elsewhere, are\r\nfrequently absent from the settlement for months at a time, and return to\r\nGenaaden Dal immediately after the completion of seed-time or harvest. It\r\nis significant that these labourers regard this period of emancipation, as\r\na sort of relaxation from the severe discipline and rules to which they\r\nare subjected in the religious community.\r\n\r\nThe principal articles of food of the inhabitants consist of maize, beans,\r\npumpkins, rice, fruits, tea, coffee, and occasionally mutton. Wine is\r\nstrictly prohibited throughout the settlement, and when a member of the\r\n_Novara_ Expedition, never imagining that this interdict extended to\r\nstrangers as well, desired the attendant at the house we were occupying to\r\nfetch a bottle of sherry, that individual regarded him with as\r\nhorror-stricken an air as though he had asked him to participate in some\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first settlers in Genaaden Dal were pure Hottentots, not more\r\nthan five or six at present speak the idiom of their fathers, the rest\r\nknowing only the Dutch tongue. The Superintendent had the kindness to\r\nallow an old blind man, of the name of Sebastian Hendrik, to be presented\r\nto us, born in the colony in 1775, of Hottentot parents, \"_een opregt\r\nHottentot_\" (an out-and-out Hottentot), as he called himself, and who\r\nstill could speak a number of phrases in his mother tongue, with its\r\nextraordinary \"clicking\" sounds; but, on the other hand, no longer had the\r\nslightest recollection of the customs, usages, or proverbs of that nation\r\nto which he belonged by birth. In the library of the community, where this\r\nconversation took place, there were also shown to us numerous sketches by\r\nHottentot and Caffre lads, which gave great hope of future excellence. It\r\nis an especially gratifying indication of intellectual progress, that\r\nseveral works of natural history are to be found on the shelves of the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH AND MISSION HOUSES OF THE MORAVIAN SETTLEMENT AT\r\nGENAADENDAL.]\r\n\r\nWe also found time to listen to the singing in the church, quite a plain\r\nwooden building, erected in 1800, with white-washed walls, a spacious\r\ngallery, and an elegant organ, the gift of a benevolent lady of Hamburg,\r\nwho spent some months of the year 1843 at Cape Town in search of health,\r\nand took an opportunity of visiting the Moravian brethren at Genaaden Dal.\r\nOne of the missionaries sat in the middle of the chapel at a table covered\r\nwith green cloth, and gave out, verse by verse, a hymn in the Dutch\r\nlanguage, which was afterwards sung, with accompaniment by the organ, by\r\nthe entire community assemble in the edifice. The men and women sat apart\r\nfrom each other, on smooth wooden benches, the former on the left, the\r\nlatter on the right of the officiating minister. The chapel was only\r\nilluminated with a few tallow candles; but the devotional feeling of the\r\ncommunity seemed to gain by this simple unostentatious ritual, and the\r\nmysterious solemn obscurity of their place of congregational worship.\r\n\r\nNext morning, 12th October, some of the brethren paid us the attention of\r\nexamining in our presence the scholars of the Seminary for Teachers, so\r\nthat we might personally satisfy ourselves of their progress in the\r\nvarious branches of education. This academy for the education of suitable\r\ninstructors, was originally established in 1838, through the generous\r\nassistance of a Saxon nobleman, Count Schönburg, and year by year since,\r\nhas been so liberally assisted by that benevolent nobleman, that its\r\nfuture prosperity seems fairly established. At present there are in the\r\nseminary 14 pupils (Hottentots, Caffres, and half-breeds). Since the year\r\nof its establishment, 50 young persons in all have been sent out hence; of\r\nwhom, however, only one half proved to be available for the duties of\r\nteachers. Up to the year 1856, twenty-two pupils were already at work in\r\nthe service of the community, fourteen had been rejected as unsuitable,\r\nand fourteen were still in the institute. They entered at from ten to\r\nfifteen years of age, remained within its walls six years for instruction,\r\nwhen they were clothed and maintained, and thereafter, without further\r\nobligations to the society which had educated them, were dispatched into\r\nthe most remote districts of the colony as teachers and apostles of\r\nChristianity. The examination of the pupils of the seminary took place at\r\nthe Library Hall, which boasts a portrait of a highly meritorious brother,\r\nthe venerable C. J. Latrobe, who, in the year 1815-16, visited South\r\nAfrica as a missionary, and, two years later published, in London, his\r\nvery remarkable book of travels. The examination commenced with a\r\nperformance on the piano by a Mestizo lad of about sixteen, son of a\r\nMulatto father by a Hottentot mother. This youth displayed a decided\r\ntalent for music, coupled with truly admirable execution; and besides the\r\npiano, played the organ, the violin, and the violoncello. Next, a variety\r\nof questions in geography and history were put to the pupils present.\r\nThese consisted chiefly of easy intelligible questions, principally\r\nrelating to England. Those examined were surprisingly well acquainted with\r\nthe history of Liverpool, London, Manchester, Dublin, &c., and could\r\nenumerate many particulars about the Thames and Westminster Abbey. What\r\nproved most disagreeable, was the singular custom that prevailed, of all\r\nthe pupils answering at once, each hoping, by out-clamouring his fellow,\r\nto prove his intimate acquaintance with the subject under discussion. The\r\nexaminer, for example, put a question to a scholar, whereupon all the\r\npupils yelled out the reply in chorus. But it was, on the whole,\r\nastonishing, and indeed eminently suggestive, to hear Hottentots, Caffres,\r\nand negroes, at the extreme southernmost part of Africa, speaking of\r\nEngland, and her influence over the destinies of humanity, as a\r\ncommercial, maritime, and industrial power. Already the youth of the\r\nsettlement are thoroughly interpenetrated with esteem and affection for\r\nthe mother country and its mighty people. As a _finale_, the assembled\r\npupils sang a Dutch _Bergmann's Gruss_, \"The Miner's Welcome,\" and one of\r\nMendelssohn's delightful songs.\r\n\r\nBefore we quitted Genaaden Dal we breakfasted with the missionaries. They\r\nare all married, and manage their households in common, and accordingly\r\npartake of their various meals together, each with his family, all seated\r\nat one table, one of their wives attending to change dishes and wait at\r\nthe table. Nowhere are any particular qualifications to be remarked, and\r\nit is difficult to conceive more thorough harmony than exists among the\r\nunpretending, yet zealously religious missionaries of Genaaden Dal.\r\n\r\nAs we were preparing for our departure, Dr. Roser unexpectedly packed up a\r\nnumber of objects of natural history and scientific interest, which he\r\nkindly presented to the Imperial expedition as a _souvenir_ of Genaaden\r\nDal. Besides these, there were also given to us two valuable little\r\nbooks,--one a small work upon the Nicobar Islands, written about the\r\nbeginning of this century by a Moravian brother of the name of Gottfried\r\nHensel; the other a treatise composed by the excellent Dr. Roser himself,\r\nupon the pharmaceutics and natural history of Genaaden Dal. With respect\r\nto the various substances chewed as stimulants, or intoxicants, by the\r\nHottentots, in order to deprive themselves of sensation, or rouse\r\nthemselves to a state of high excitability, we found the following\r\nparticulars in this interesting essay. That most in use is composed of the\r\nbruised leaves of the \"_Leonotis Leonurus_.\" This plant, which grows in\r\ngreat quantity in and beyond the Genaaden Dal, is called by the natives\r\n\"Dagga,\" as also frequently, \"Tacha or Takka,\" and this variation in\r\npronunciation is very probably the reason that we find in Berghaus's\r\n\"_Völker des Erdballs_\" (Races of the Globe), this celebrated smoke-weed,\r\nmarked as \"Donha.\" What the same author says of certain stimulating\r\nproperties of the plant may well be considered as an exaggeration. It is\r\ncurious how the properties of this plant seem to be inextricably mingled\r\nwith the destinies of the Hottentots. In many places it has been\r\nextirpated, in order more readily to wean the aborigines from the practice\r\nof chewing: at other places again, \"_Leonotis Leonurus_\" is expressly\r\nplanted in order to attract the Hottentots, and so supply any deficiency\r\nin hands for labour, reckless of the moral consequences. Another narcotic,\r\nand the most widely prevalent, is the wild hemp (_Canabis Sativa_), the\r\ndried leaves of which are smoked by the natives. Dr. Juritz, one of the\r\nmost respectable apothecaries in Cape Town, assured us he had been\r\ncompelled, during a previous residence at Stellenbosch, where he was\r\nengaged in his business, to keep always on hand in his store a large\r\nquantity of wild hemp for sale to the natives.\r\n\r\nThe poison with which the Bushmen tip their arrows, rendering them such\r\ndangerous and terrible weapons, is extracted from the \"_Cestrum\r\nvenenatum_.\"[53]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: The Dyaks of Borneo poison their arrows with the juice of\r\n_Strychnos Tieuté_ and _Antiaris Toxicaria_ (Upas).]\r\n\r\nAmong the animal products of Genaaden Dal of importance in a scientific\r\npoint of view is Hyrazeuma, a substance obtained from the urine of the\r\nCape Marmot (_Hyrax Capensis_). It is of a dark-brown colour, somewhat\r\ntenacious, and nearly hard, of a very penetrating odour, and is found in\r\ncavities resembling a molehill. This article is made use of with much\r\neffect in hysterical complaints by the Hottentots. Dr. Roser is of\r\nopinion, that this Cape Marmot is in all probability the same animal which\r\nMartin Luther, in Leviticus, c. xi, v. 5, and Proverbs, c. xxx, v. 26, has\r\ntranslated by the word \"_kaninchen_\" (conies).\r\n\r\nOn our way from Genaaden Dal to Caledon, to which there is an excellent\r\nlevel road, we perceived a large number of silver poplars, with pendent\r\nnests of finches. On a single tree we counted more than forty such pendent\r\nnests, constructed in a very singular manner.\r\n\r\nCaledon is a cheerful, ambitious little town, important as the centre of\r\nthe wool trade, as also for the thermal springs in the neighbourhood.\r\nThese, situated about two English miles outside the town, on a rising\r\nground, in a romantic and highly attractive neighbourhood, are impregnated\r\nwith iron, and of a considerable temperature. Even in the bath-house,\r\ndistant about a mile from the source of the spring, a thermometer held in\r\na stone trough, filled to overflowing, marked from 100°·4 to 104° Fahr. At\r\ntheir respective sources the one spring has a temperature of 116°·6 Fahr.\r\nand the other 114°·8 Fahr. The colour of the water is ochre yellow. From\r\nthe terrace of the bath-house a rather extensive landscape opens to the\r\nview, backed by a splendid range of mountains, including the Tower of\r\nBabel, as the inhabitants have christened the highest peak in this\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nCaledon has 600 inhabitants. About twenty years ago there were not more\r\nthan ten bales of wool grown in the entire district. At present about\r\n800,000 lbs. are shipped annually. One Merino sheep supplies from 1 lb. to\r\n1-1/2 lb. of wool, worth from 1_s._ 2_d._ to 1_s._ 4_d._ sterling per\r\npound. Besides Caledon, the principal wool districts of Cape Colony are\r\nSwellendam, Beaufort, and Graaf-Reinet. All these districts united produce\r\nyearly about 15,000,000 lbs. of wool, worth about _£_1,000,000 sterling.\r\nWithin two years the wool produce of the entire colony has increased 30\r\nper cent., and during last year a strenuous and very costly experiment has\r\nbeen made to introduce the Angora breed, with the intention of increasing\r\nthe wool-producing powers of the less fleecy race by a judicious cross\r\nwith the native species.\r\n\r\nThe road to Somerset-West leads over the high and picturesque Hauw-Hoek\r\nPass and Sir Lowry's Pass; the latter is very steep, and parts of it are\r\nhardly, if at all, inferior in extent and variety of landscape to those\r\npresented by the Styrian Alps. At the culminating point of the latter\r\npass, which surpasses even Paine's Kloef in height and width, one stands\r\nas upon the ruins of a lofty tower, from which the eye can range at will\r\nover the entire country beneath. South-east and eastward towers the\r\nHauw-Hoek Pass, while southwards and westwards the charming Lowry's Vale,\r\nand far in the distance the smiling settlement of Somerset-West come into\r\nview, while all around, farther than the eye can reach, are luxuriant\r\npasturages, that only wait to be settled and cultivated in order to\r\nproduce magnificent returns.\r\n\r\nSomerset-West, a prettily-built, and very charmingly situated settlement,\r\nalready supports so considerable a traffic with the capital that a daily\r\nomnibus has proved a remunerative speculation to the promoters.\r\n\r\nWe now proceeded to Zandvliet, the property of one of the oldest and most\r\nhighly considered families in the colony, named Cloete, where we spent the\r\nnight. With these genial kindly people we soon felt ourselves as entirely\r\nat home as if with our own families; we sang, laughed, and frolicked, till\r\nfar into the night.\r\n\r\nThe following morning we drove to a hill, about a mile and a half distant\r\nfrom Zandvliet, known as Macassar Downs, on which is the spot of\r\ninterment, (Krammat or Brammat), of a Malay prophet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF A MALAY PROPHET AT ZANDVLIET.]\r\n\r\nThis individual, so honoured in death, was, if we are to believe the\r\nMalays, a direct descendant of Mahomet, named Sheikh Joseph, who, expelled\r\nfrom Batavia by the Dutch Government for political reasons, settled in the\r\ncolony about a century and a half ago, and died and was buried in the\r\nneighbourhood of Zandvliet. An especial deputation came over from Malacca\r\nto Cape Colony to fetch away the corpse of the defunct prophet, for\r\nconveyance to the land of his birth; but at the disinterment it happened\r\nthat the little finger of the prophet, in spite of the most persevering\r\nresearch, could nowhere be found. This circumstance appeared to those\r\nsimple believers sufficient reason for erecting a monument over the spot\r\nin which the finger of a Malay prophet lay hid from view. Even to this day\r\nthe Malays from time to time perform a pilgrimage to the Colony and\r\ncelebrate their religious ceremonies at the Mausoleum. Four followers of\r\nthe prophet are buried with him, two of them Mahometan priests, who are\r\nregarded with much veneration by the Malays. An extensive flight of stone\r\nsteps leads to the tomb, the exterior of which is very insignificant, and,\r\nbut for a small pointed turret, hardly differs from an ordinary\r\ndwelling-house. On entering, a low-roofed vault is visible, a sort of\r\nfront outhouse, which rather disfigures the façade, and much more\r\nresembles a cellar than the portal of a Mausoleum. Above the arch of this\r\nvault an Arabic inscription has been engraved with a stylus; but this is\r\nso painted over in brick colour that it has already become almost\r\nillegible. Judging by the few words that have been deciphered, it seems to\r\nconsist of the first propositions of the Koran.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE MAUSOLEUM.]\r\n\r\nThe inner room, provided on two sides with modern glazed windows at\r\nirregular intervals, is about the size of an ordinary room of 12 feet\r\nlong, 9 wide, and 7 high. In the middle rises the monument, to which\r\naccess is had by some more brick steps. Immense quantities of unwashed\r\nwhite linen cloth are heaped upon it, which seem occasionally sprinkled\r\nwith a brown odoriferous liquid (_dupa_). As at the head of Sheikh Joseph,\r\nso at his feet several figures, resembling those in enamel used to\r\nornament tarts, are drawn upon the linen cloth with the overflowings of\r\nthe unguent. These have undoubtedly been formed accidentally, and it\r\nappears wrong and unfair to attribute to them any more recondite\r\nsignificance. The monument rests upon four wooden pillars, with pyramidal\r\npinnacles or ornaments, and is richly decorated with fine white muslin,\r\nwhich gives to the whole very much the appearance of an old-fashioned\r\nEnglish \"fourposter,\" with its costly drapery and curtains. While the\r\ncurtains are spread out all around, several small green and white\r\nbannerets stand at the upper and lower end of the sarcophagus. The whole\r\ninterior is, as it were, impregnated with the incense which devout Malay\r\npilgrims from time to time burn here, especially after the forty days'\r\nfast (Ramadan), or leave behind upon the steps of the tomb in flasks or in\r\npaper-boxes. On such occasions, they always bring wax-candles and linen\r\ncloth as an offering, with the latter of which they deck the tomb afresh,\r\nso that a perfect mountain of white linen rises above the stone floor.\r\nDuring their devotions they unceasingly kiss this white mass of stuff, and\r\nas they are continually chewing tobacco, this filthy habit produces\r\ndisgustingly loathsome stains.\r\n\r\nOn the same hill which boasts the tomb of Sheikh Joseph, there are also,\r\nin ground that is common property, nine other graves of eminent Malays,\r\nenclosed with carefully-selected stones, and likewise covered over with\r\nlarge broad strips of bleached linen cloth, protected by stones from any\r\ninjury by weather or violence. At the head and foot of each individual\r\ninterred, is a single stone of larger size. Formerly the black inhabitants\r\nof the neighbourhood made use of this store of linen cloth to make shirts\r\nfor themselves, without further thought upon the propriety of the matter.\r\nLatterly, however, a shrewd Malay priest spread a report that one of these\r\nebony linen stealers had lost all the fingers off one hand, since which\r\nthe graves of those departed worthies remain inviolate and unprofaned.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the hill are some small half-fallen-in buildings, near a\r\nlarge hall, painted white, red, and yellow, consisting of a small\r\napartment and a kitchen, the whole in a most dirty, neglected, and\r\ndesolate condition. At this point the Moslems must have accomplished\r\ncertain prayers, before they can climb the hill and proceed to visit the\r\ntomb. Over the door of this singular house of prayer some words are\r\nlikewise engraved in the Arabic character, which, however, are now\r\nentirely illegible.\r\n\r\nOn quitting the Malay Krammat, we next undertook a tolerably difficult\r\nwalk to the Downs or sand-dunes, which at this point extend along the\r\nentire coast line, on which the wax-berry shrub, as already mentioned,\r\ngrows wild in vast quantities, and visibly prevents the further\r\nencroachments of the moving sand. The Eerst Rivier (First River) may be\r\nregarded as the limit of demarcation between the sand-dunes and the soil\r\nadapted for vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe same evening the naturalists of the Expedition left hospitable\r\nZandvliet, though not till after they had been presented by Herr Cloete\r\nwith a splendid collection of fruits indigenous to Port Natal. Having been\r\neverywhere received with distinction, and enjoyed every sort of assistance\r\nin our researches, we set out on our return so richly freighted with\r\nobjects of natural history, that the waggon, as we drove through the wide\r\nstreets of Cape Town, presented such a various and substantial assortment\r\nof each as spoke volumes for the success of our journey. Every available\r\ncorner was called into requisition to dispose of our prizes--even between\r\nthe open windows hung suspended the bottle-shaped nests of the finch, and\r\nthe slender sticks that supported the tilt were entwined with gigantic\r\nfestoons of flowers. In a word, the whole waggon, with its variegated\r\ncontents, resembled a holiday-van on its return from a country excursion,\r\nso gaily and cheerfully was it decorated.\r\n\r\nDuring our residence in the Cape colony, severe depression existed among\r\nthe agricultural inhabitants of the Western and Eastern districts, in\r\nconsequence of an epidemic which, within two years, had carried off 64,850\r\nhorses (draught horses, mares, and foals), of the value of £525,000\r\nsterling.[54] Many landowners in consequence entirely gave up rearing\r\nhorses, and turned their attention almost exclusively to the breeding of\r\nsheep. The visitations of this malady are by no means of late\r\nintroduction, but hitherto they had made their appearance at such long\r\nintervals, that but little attention was paid to them and people regarded\r\ntheir return without much alarm. This disease of the horse, usually\r\nendemic in Cape Colony, assumed every twenty years, owing to some\r\ninexplicable causes, an epidemic character, and on those occasions\r\nextended over an extensive area, as happened with extraordinary regularity\r\nin the years 1780, 1801, 1819, 1839, and 1854. Hitherto no further\r\nprecaution was taken, than, so soon as the disease appeared, to drive the\r\nhorses from the grass pastures to their stables or covered sheds, and\r\nthere supply them with fodder, the night dew being considered a main cause\r\nof the complaint. A resident in Stellenbosch, indeed, maintained that the\r\ndew which was deposited during the continuance of the disease tasted quite\r\nbitter, and was of an unusual brownish tinge. Singular to say, not the\r\nslightest symptoms of illness manifested themselves in the swine, dogs,\r\nand birds of prey which devoured the carcases of horses that died of the\r\ndisease, while the consumption, whether boiled or roasted, of mutton\r\nwhich was ever so slightly tainted with the mere germ of this malady,\r\nnever failed to produce the most mischievous consequences on the human\r\nspecies. According to Dr. Livingstone the same malignant ulcerous\r\nimposthumes were produced, if even sound portions were used of the carcase\r\nof an animal that had died of this complaint. These observations, founded\r\non innumerable examples, run counter to the opinion of the French\r\nphysicians and physiologists, that the malignity of the poison in such\r\ncases becomes neutralized by the process of cooking. Considering the\r\nimportance of the subject to a land-holding colony, it could hardly fail\r\nthat numerous individuals should devote themselves to elucidating the\r\ncauses of this devastating epidemic; but it must ever remain a striking\r\nand significant fact, illustrative of the high standard of cultivation in\r\nCape Colony, that within a very few years 112 different authors published\r\ntreatises respecting this complaint among the horses. The result of these\r\nnumerous researches was, that the malady is epidemic, but not contagious;\r\nthat horses driven into the stable before sunset, and not permitted to go\r\nout to pasture till the dew has evaporated off the grass, are as a rule\r\nexempted from attack; that those horses which are kept at night in open\r\npounds, or in places where there are heaps of dung, take the disease in a\r\nmilder form than if suffered to roam at large day and night; lastly, that\r\nhorses for which no covered shelter can be provided, may with great\r\nadvantage be sent to hilly localities and dry runs of land. The practical\r\nremedy which was most resorted to, consisted in immediate and prolonged\r\nbleeding, pushed to actual exhaustion of the animal, in the first stage of\r\nthe malady, as also the exhibition of 1 drachm of tartar emetic and 2\r\ndrachms of calomel, or, at a later stage, of 30 grains of tartar emetic\r\ntwice a day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: At the same time 92,793 head of cattle (draught oxen, cows,\r\nand calves) fell a sacrifice to a disease of the lungs, and we were\r\nassured that the original cause of this terribly fatal malady\r\n(_Pleuropneumonia_) is attributable to a bull having been imported from\r\nHolland, in the year 1854, in a diseased state. The English public will\r\nremember the severe panic under which Continental graziers, and others\r\nconnected with the cattle trade, laboured during the years 1854-55 and the\r\ncommencement of 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TSETSE FLY.]\r\n\r\nAnother appalling scourge of the settlers in the south-west district of\r\nCape Colony is a minute, almost imperceptible insect, of terrible omen,\r\nthe _tsetse-fly_ (_Glossina morsitans_), a puncture from which produces\r\nsuch terrible destruction among horses and cattle, that several runs of\r\nland are uninhabitable--nay, even the mere passing through districts which\r\nthey frequent, proves fatal to the draught beasts of the caravans. This\r\ninsect is principally encountered in copses and brushwood, very seldom in\r\nthe open country, and is about the size of a common house fly, but with\r\nwings a little longer. In colour it resembles the honey bee. The tsetse is\r\nuncommonly active, and usually escapes all attempts to catch it with the\r\nhand; but in the cool of the morning or evening it is less active and\r\nquick in its movements. The poison which it carries is so powerful that\r\nthe bite of three or four individuals is sufficient to kill the most\r\npowerful ox. Many animals, especially such as appear perfectly sound or in\r\nthe best condition, die speedily after being bitten, but the majority are\r\nill for an entire week, and usually become blind before death. One\r\nremarkable circumstance is that the bite of these insects is fatal to\r\ndogs, even when fed with milk, while calves and other young animals, so\r\nlong as they are sucking, remain perfectly exempt from the malefic powers\r\nof the tsetse. It is especially noticed that the danger seems to be\r\nconfined to domesticated animals, while such as are wild or only half\r\nreclaimed, such as buffaloes, zebras, jackals, oxen, horses, and wild\r\ndogs, have not the slightest occasion to dread this insect; nay more, it\r\nattacks man himself without the least ill consequences. The sensation\r\nwhich their bite produces on the hand, or other portion of the human\r\nframe, would be confounded by any one travelling in the tsetse district,\r\nwith that of another minute and most troublesome, though by no means\r\ndangerous insect, the flea. Fortunately the tsetse-fly has an appointed\r\ncircuit to range in, in the south-west of the Cape Colony, which it never\r\nchanges or extends. The landowner may erect his cattle-pound on one side\r\nof the stream in perfect security, although the opposite bank may resound\r\nwith the hum of swarms of these insects. When the natives, who are\r\nacquainted with the localities in which the tsetse-fly abides, are\r\ncompelled, as they constantly are, to shift their ground, and, in changing\r\ntheir pastures, to transgress upon the district of the tsetse, they\r\nusually select the moonlight nights of winter, when the insect, during the\r\nquiet hours of the cold season, is not likely to molest their charge.\r\n\r\nMany travellers whose draught oxen and horses have been killed by the\r\nravages of this insect, are annually not merely frustrated in their\r\njourney, but, it appears, have their personal safety seriously imperilled\r\nby being deprived of all means of locomotion. Anderson, in his admirable\r\nwork upon \"Lake Ngami,\" relates that some twenty aborigines of the Griqua\r\nrace, who had been elephant-hunting in the north-west of that lake, and\r\nwere provided with three large waggons and numerous oxen and horses,\r\nfound, on their return to their encampment, that they had lost the whole\r\nof their cattle-team by the bite of the tsetse. So, too, Dr. Livingstone,\r\nduring a short journey over a district frequented by the tsetse, lost\r\nforty-three strong and useful oxen, although by dint of great vigilance\r\nscarcely twenty flies had been able to settle among the entire herd. We\r\nhave dwelt at length on the description of the ravages caused by this so\r\nmuch dreaded insect, with the view of pointing out the numerous and\r\namazing difficulties which present themselves to the traveller or settler\r\nin certain localities, and how often not only wild and rapacious animals,\r\nbut even small, hardly perceptible insects endanger the life of the\r\nwanderer, and render large tracts of lands valueless for settlement.[55]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Most valuable comprehensive details, as to the natural\r\nhistory of the tsetse-fly, its ravages, and its migration into the\r\ndistricts which it frequents, are to be found in the \"Transactions of the\r\nRoyal Society,\" Volume XX., page 148; \"Proceedings of the London\r\nGeological Society,\" page 217; Charles John Anderson's \"Lake Ngami; or,\r\nExplorations and Discoveries during Four Years' Wanderings in the Wilds of\r\nWestern Africa,\" London, 1856; Dr. Livingstone's \"Missionary Travels and\r\nResearches in South Africa,\" London, 1857. The agent of the London\r\nMissionary Society at the Cape of Good Hope, the estimable, highly\r\nrespected Dr. Thompson, gave us a small piece of a root called _fly-root_,\r\nwhich is considered to grow from a parasite, and a decoction of which is\r\nreckoned by the aborigines an antidote to the bite of the tsetse-fly.\r\nUnfortunately the requisite material was not in sufficient quantity to\r\nadmit of determining the plant itself, or of instituting further\r\nresearches with it.]\r\n\r\nNo stranger can well leave Cape Town without having visited Constantia,\r\nthe chief seat of the wine cultivation of the country. Accordingly we had\r\na day of exceedingly pleasant relaxation while visiting High Constantia.\r\nMr. James Mosenthal, the very hospitable Austrian Consul, had carefully\r\nselected the most beautiful spot in the immediate vicinity of Cape Town,\r\nthe charming residence of his friend Mynheer Van Reenen, at which to get\r\nup a splendid _fête champêtre_ on an extensive scale, in honour of the\r\nvisit of this the first man-of-war that had borne the flag of our country\r\ninto these remote seas. The entire staff of our frigate was invited, and\r\nover a hundred guests, comprising the flower of the fair sex of Cape Town,\r\ntook part in the festivities. Immense four-horse coaches conveyed the\r\ncompany in the forenoon to the hill of Constantia. The company wandered at\r\nleisure under the gigantic oak trees, or in the beautifully laid-out\r\ngarden of this extensive domain, and after a sumptuous _déjeuner_, the\r\nmajority set to dancing. A small orchestra of stringed instruments played\r\nalternately with the ship's band in the garden, and in the tastefully\r\ndecorated apartment. Those who did not care to dance, or whom a burning\r\nafternoon sun prevented from walking in the open air, might escape into\r\ncool and most elegant cellars, where our hospitable entertainer had stored\r\nlarge quantities of \"spiritual treasures.\" The costly nectar which the\r\nCape, and especially High Constantia, produces, finds its way but seldom\r\nto European tables, because the quantity produced is very much below the\r\ndemand; for although the first cultivation of the grape for wine dates in\r\nCape Colony so far back as 1668, the wine manufacture has only of late\r\nyears expanded in a marked degree,--viz., 45 per cent. from 1855 to 1856,\r\nand 70 per cent. from 1856 to 1857, so that at present the entire quantity\r\nproduced of red and white Cape wine (Pontac and Frontignac) may be stated\r\nat 24,000 pipes, worth £380,000 sterling.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the _fête_ we sat down to a splendid banquet in the\r\nopen air, in a shady avenue, so as to admit of all the guests sitting at\r\none long table. At the upper end, under the umbrageous boughs of some\r\nvenerable oaks, that towered like a canopy overhead, fluttered the flags\r\nof England and Austria. The mayor of Cape Town occupied the chair; the\r\ntoasts customary on such occasions were given and responded to, allusion\r\nbeing made to the pleasure felt at the arrival of an Austrian man-of-war,\r\nas also to the gratitude of the members of the Expedition for the hearty\r\nwelcome prepared for them, and expressing an earnest hope that both\r\nGovernments may ever continue faithfully allied, as both nations are, by\r\ndescent, sympathy, and intellectual pursuits. A few days after this\r\nsplendid entertainment, we returned to Simon's Bay, whence the _Novara_\r\nwas already preparing to sail. The several weeks' stay of the frigate at\r\nthe little settlement of Simon's Bay, together with a certain quantity of\r\nrepairs, had called forth a most unwonted briskness of business. Amid so\r\ncircumscribed a population, the sudden influx of more than three hundred\r\nadditional consumers, with their varying wants, speedily made itself\r\nperceptible in every class of the community, the more so as most of the\r\nheavy stores for the voyage were bought here, so that the sum set in\r\ncirculation during these few weeks amounted to some £2,000. At the same\r\ntime the Expedition were readily permitted to contribute a mite towards\r\nbuilding the Catholic Church in Simon's Town, and to present some priests'\r\ngarments, altar cloths, and church fittings, which had been intended by\r\nthe Austrian Government for distribution among four Catholic Missionaries\r\nin the various quarters of the globe visited.\r\n\r\nSome members of the Expedition also set out on an excursion some thirty\r\nnautical miles, to where the peninsula of the Cape stretches out to the\r\nreal Cape of Good Hope itself--a longer, more difficult, but also more\r\ninteresting expedition, which gave fresher impressions, and conveyed a\r\npretty accurate and more just idea of the physical features of the\r\nPeninsula of the Cape, its vegetation, zoology, and geological structure,\r\nthan could be obtained by a cursory examination, of the natural features\r\nof a large portion of South Africa. For whoever has clambered up the torn,\r\nbroken, rocky masses of Table Mountain, worn out and eaten away by the\r\natmosphere, and has scrambled among its wild hollows, with its forests of\r\nthe greyish green _Pratea Gargentea_ at his feet, amid its far extending\r\nrocky plateaux, full of stagnant water-pools; whoever has strayed thence\r\namong the wine-producing terraced hills of Constantia, with their rich\r\nvegetation; over the sandy table-lands backed by rocky ridges, over\r\nstreams of copper-coloured water, and the boggy tracts that extend to the\r\nextreme south-west point, as far as the Sandstone rocks, 800 feet high,\r\nwhich, descending sheer into the tempest-tossed, fearsome, boiling ocean,\r\nconstitutes the actual Cape of Good Hope--obtains a tolerably just and\r\ncorrect idea of the appearance of Southern Africa for one hundred miles\r\ninto the interior, and along the coast line, 400 English miles in length,\r\nwhich stretches from St. Helena Bay as far as the River Samtoos, west of\r\nAlgoa Bay. All is sandstone or clay-slate, with occasional granitic knobs\r\ncropping out; no trees, but such as are planted in clumps around the\r\nsparsely scattered farms, conspicuous from an immense distance; while, on\r\nthe other hand, in spring, an indescribable flush of blossoms and flowers,\r\nand instead of trees, millions of ant-hills, with their regularly shaped\r\ncones from three to four feet high, impart a peculiar character to the\r\nlandscape of South Africa. But on the so-called Lowlands of Algoa Bay,\r\nbeyond the River Samtoos, Nature assumes an entirely different character\r\nin her forest vegetation. Unfortunately, the original designs of the\r\ngeologists of the Expedition, of Examining the petrified treasures of this\r\nrenowned district, fell through, which was all the more to be regretted as\r\nthis geological Eldorado promised a great accession to our collection.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Simon's Town, we also experimented with our\r\nastronomical instruments, which, at our next station, St. Paul's Island,\r\nwere to be brought fully into requisition for the first time. On this\r\noccasion, as on many others, the unfailing courtesy and kindness of the\r\nrenowned astronomer and director of the Observatory of Cape Town, Mr.\r\nThomas Maclear, assisted us most materially in the observations for\r\ncomparison with our own physical instruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.--FROM THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE TO ST. PAUL'S ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 26th October it fell calm, changing to variable\r\nbreezes and light puffs of wind, that made it doubtful whether we could\r\nsail that day, as we needed a catspaw from the West in order to weigh\r\nanchor. From the English line of battle-ship _Boscawen_, there floated\r\nacross the bay as we worked out, the Austrian National Anthem, played as a\r\nfarewell--a graceful mark of recognition--which was replied to by our band\r\nperforming the sister hymn, \"God Save the Queen.\"\r\n\r\nWe steered between Noah's Ark and Roman Rock, coasting along till we made\r\nWhittle Rock, but the wind shifting, we were, ere long, compelled to tack.\r\nHad we not seized the favourable moment to get away, it would, a couple of\r\nhours later, have been impossible to put to sea, as the wind sprang up\r\nfrom the S.E. and blew fresh. Towards sundown, the sky cleared up, and we\r\nonce more caught sight of the serrated outline of the southernmost point,\r\nwith its desolate, worn, hollowed-out, rocky masses, which, however, with\r\nthe _souvenirs_ of the hearty reception that had been accorded us in Cape\r\nTown seemed on this occasion much more home-like and habitable. All of\r\nus, indeed, carried with us in our breasts the most cordial and agreeable\r\nreminiscences of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nIn spite of many drawbacks and deficiencies of physical requisites, which\r\noppose the rapid development of its natural resources, Cape Colony\r\npossesses in its healthy climate its valuable indigenous products, and its\r\nfree political institutions, a guarantee for its perhaps gradual, but on\r\nthat account more substantial, progress. It is a favourable specimen of a\r\nprosperous agricultural colony able to maintain itself, whose inhabitants,\r\nseeking in the peaceable cultivation of the soil their sole reward, are\r\nexposed to none of those ruinous reverses of fortune, which make life in\r\nthose lands that are rich only in a metallic currency so stormy and\r\nuncomfortable, and render their future so problematical.\r\n\r\nA colony, which already employs annually, in its commerce all over the\r\nworld, a thousand ships, which has a trade valued at nearly £2,000,000\r\nsterling, and before long will be in a position to export 30,000,000 lbs.\r\nof wool a year, besides an unlimited quantity of wines already in great\r\ndemand, whose soil, owing to its prolific nature, returns, under human\r\ncultivation, crops of one hundred-fold, while in its unexplored districts\r\nas many additional vegetable and mineral treasures lie unavailable as yet--\r\nsuch a colony carries in itself the germs of a splendid development into a\r\ngreat and most enviable future. Provided with laws of a most liberal\r\nscope, and institutions corresponding to the spirit of our times, which\r\nleave each colonist entirely at liberty to develope his powers and\r\ncapabilities in whatever direction he pleases, Cape Colony must, ere long,\r\nstand forth as the pattern colony for all others in the different\r\ncountries beyond sea,--a majestic monument of the reward so justly due to\r\nthe English nation for its policy in promoting the moral and material\r\nprogress of mankind in the most remote corners of the earth.\r\n\r\nWe lay a southerly course in order to strike the regular Westerly winds,\r\nwhich we might hope to fall in with in the neighbourhood of 40° S., and\r\nalready we again saw our old friends, the albatross, the cape pigeon, and\r\nthe stormy petrel, in innumerable quantities.\r\n\r\nBy the evening of the 28th we had attained our limit in the South-west,\r\nbut the West winds had not yet made their appearance, so that we had to\r\ncontend till 1st November with baffling light winds alternating with\r\ncalms. At length in 37° 30' S. and 18° 4' E., we encountered Westerly\r\nbreezes, which, ere long, freshened, veered to the southward, and\r\ncompelled us to shorten sail. We were at this time not quite as yet in the\r\nzone of West winds, but had to do with variable winds; which, however, as\r\nthe prevailing winds must be west or south, could generally be made\r\navailable to enable us to lay our course for St. Paul. Although in the\r\nmonth corresponding to May in the southern hemisphere, we found ourselves\r\nshivering with cold, the thermometer barely reached 18° Cent. (64°·4 Fah.)\r\nduring the day in the open air, and our bodies, accustomed of late to a\r\nmilder temperature, felt as though it were twice more rigorous than it\r\nactually was, in consequence of the wind coming from the ice-bound\r\nantarctic regions.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of 4th November, a great excitement arose on board; a\r\nviolent shower filled the lifeboats with water, and a large black object\r\nwas observed swimming in the sea. Fortunately, it was not a man, though it\r\nproved to be a great favourite that had fallen overboard. Bessy, an ape,\r\nhad got loose from her chain, and while being chased, fell in her\r\neagerness into the sea, which fortunately was tolerably smooth. The droll\r\nlittle brute had quickly made itself such a favourite with the crew from\r\nits comical attractive ways, that its sudden fall overboard awoke\r\nuniversal sympathy. A boat was lowered, and Bessy rescued, who speedily\r\nrecovered from her fright, and although dripping wet, proceeded to consume\r\nan orange that was handed her with an expression of entire satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOn reaching 40° S., 31° E., the West winds became more steady, with a\r\nperceptible increase of motion, giving an average of 33 feet as the height\r\nof the waves, while the frigate rolled heavily. Sometimes several\r\n\"Rollers\" would follow one after the other, which made the ship heel over\r\nfrom 20° to 25° on either side. At each roll, streams of water poured in\r\nupon the gun-deck. The cannon-shot kept up a deafening dance from one side\r\nto the other, while stools, tables, chests, and in short everything that\r\ncould move, were unmistakably \"lively.\" The temperature of the air during\r\nthe night fell to 41° Fahrenheit, and was felt yet more keenly in squalls\r\naccompanied by rain, which made our life on board anything but agreeable,\r\nalthough the certainty that we were proceeding favourably with the\r\nso-called \"_Fair_\" Westerly winds indemnified us in some degree for the\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\nOn 14th November, in 40° 44' S., 60° 8' E., we availed ourselves of a dead\r\ncalm and smooth sea to try a cast of Brooke's Patent Deep-sea Lead.\r\n\r\nWhile at Rio, we had been supplied, through the kindness of Don José de\r\nBarnabé, Commander of the Royal Spanish Frigate _Bilbao_, with a large\r\nquantity of lead-line, after an unsuccessful attempt to purchase it there.\r\nUnfortunately, however, the line had become somewhat decomposed by\r\nmoisture, and gave way at 6,170 fathoms (37,020 English feet) while still\r\nrunning out, so that on this occasion also, we could only tell that bottom\r\nhad _not_ been reached with the portion of the line paid out.\r\n\r\nThe times occupied by the line in running out were as follows:--\r\n\r\n         1st 1000  fathoms  15 minutes 36 seconds.\r\n         2nd   \"      \"     26    \"    59    \"\r\n         3rd   \"      \"     34    \"    20    \"\r\n         4th   \"      \"     43    \"    25    \"\r\n         5th   \"      \"     61    \"     5    \"\r\n         6th   \"      \"     75    \"    55    \"\r\n And the last 170     \"     11    \"    40    \"\r\n             ____           ______________________\r\n      Total 6,170     \"     4 hours    29 minutes.\r\n\r\nTo the apparatus two 30-lbs. shot were attached, and the first 100 fathoms\r\nof line were doubled. By this observation we satisfied ourselves that such\r\nsoundings are only successful when none but the best materials are\r\nemployed, and, moreover, that the line becomes deteriorated in an\r\nextraordinary degree by long stowage on boardship, so that it is better in\r\nlong voyages not to take such large supplies of line, but to adopt most\r\nstringent measures to prevent its being weakened by damp. Very probably a\r\nlight coating of tar over the line would tend to keep it in good\r\npreservation, and it also seems advisable proportionately to strengthen\r\nthe first 500 or 1000 fathoms.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th November the look-out man descried from the main topgallant\r\nmast-head the Island of St. Paul, the goal of our wishes, the object which\r\nhad so long occupied our thoughts, and on which our scientific\r\ncapabilities were to be called into enviable activity. The necessary\r\narrangements were completed for facilitating astronomical observations,\r\nthe instruments and other necessaries taken out and got in readiness to be\r\nconveyed to the island, and the various stations and duties of the\r\ndifferent members specified, so as to admit of the observations being\r\ncompleted in the shortest possible time.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th November, at daybreak, we found ourselves close in with St.\r\nPaul's Island, while on our port-side the outline of New Amsterdam was\r\nvisible in the shape of two lofty peaks on the horizon. As the wind blew\r\nfrom the N.W., we kept the ship's course past the north promontory of the\r\nisland, and ranged along the eastern side to the selected anchoring\r\nground. As we doubled the northernmost point, the conical-shaped Nine-Pin\r\nRock came into view, while the high and precipitous margin of the island\r\nin the N.E. with the entrance into the crater became visible. How great,\r\nhowever, was our astonishment, when we observed some neatly laid-out\r\nterraces, of a fresher green hue than were observed in the upper\r\ntable-lands of the island! These were evidently spots cultivated by former\r\nor present residents in the island. But no traces of habitation were seen,\r\nwhether of mankind or of the seal. Only flights of albatrosses, bryons,\r\nospreys, and sea-swallows, with now and then the protracted screams (like\r\nhuman groans) of immense flights of penguins, those singular-looking\r\nsea-birds, which awaken so deep an interest alike for their striking\r\nappearance as by their mode of life.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the rock of the island showed layers of black lava,\r\nalternating with yellow and red tufa, which seemed stratified regularly\r\nfrom the rim of the crater to the extreme circumference of the island.\r\n\"Thirty fathoms, and no bottom,\" sung the wearied leadsman; and presently,\r\n\"Thirty fathoms,\"--and a few minutes before 9 A.M. the anchor rattled out,\r\non the 24th day after we left Simon's Bay, after retracing our steps\r\nEastward some 3000 miles. Our anchorage, as we afterwards became aware,\r\nwas not the best possible, as we ought to have lain closer in to the\r\nisland. But when one anchors nearer the land in a less depth of water,\r\none is by no means more protected from storms sweeping in from seawards,\r\nto which the entire eastern half of the island lies exposed. Only on the\r\nwest side does the island, with the steep margin of the crater some 700 or\r\n800 feet high, afford any protection against the west winds, which,\r\nhowever, seldom blow here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARRIVAL AT ST.

Of the various ships\r\nwhich, since the discovery of those islands, have visited them for\r\nscientific purposes, hardly any have remained long enough to be in a\r\nposition to acquire a thorough acquaintance with the various objects of\r\nnatural history and scientific interest that present themselves. Even the\r\nvisit paid by the naturalist attached to the expedition on board the\r\nEnglish ship _Lion_ and _Hindostan_ which, on the 2nd of February, 1793,\r\ntouched at St. Paul, _en route_ to China, and to whom we are indebted for\r\nthe first detailed account of this island, erroneously spoken of as\r\nAmsterdam (following the example of former English navigators), did not\r\ncome within the original design of that Ambassadorial expedition. It was\r\nthe result rather of accident that, as the _Lion_ and _Hindostan_ were\r\npassing close in with St. Paul, two human beings were descried on the\r\nshore, waving in the air a piece of canvas fastened on poles, who\r\napparently were anxious to convey to the expedition their desire to\r\ncommunicate with their ships. It was supposed these were shipwrecked\r\nmariners, stranded on this dangerous coast, who regarded the arrival of\r\nthe _Lion_ as an unexpected means of rescue. To save these\r\nfellow-creatures from so desperate a position, the Captain of the _Lion_\r\ndeclared to be a pleasing duty assigned by Providence, and rejoiced to\r\nhave been selected as the instrument of their deliverance. When, however,\r\nthe boat of the British man-of-war, which was despatched to take off the\r\ncastaways and bring them on board ship, had landed on the island, the crew\r\nspeedily discovered the singular delusion which all had laboured under.\r\nThe men, whom motives of humanity had intended to rescue from this\r\ninhospitable place, turned out to be anything but involuntary residents on\r\nthe island, being seal-hunters, who for five months had dwelt here, and\r\npurposed remaining ten months longer, with the intention of completing a\r\ncargo of 25,000 seal-skins, for which at that time there was a very\r\nconsiderable and lucrative demand in the Chinese markets,[58] and the\r\nsignals which had first attracted their attention, it now appeared were\r\nfor no other object than to enable them to feel themselves once more,\r\nafter such an interval, in the company of their fellowmen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Captain C. P. Blackwood, of H.M.S. _Fly_, 1842, and Captain\r\nDenham, C.B., of H.M. Surveying Ship _Herald_, 1853. M. Tinot \"_capitaine\r\ndu long cours_,\" who visited St. Paul in the summer of 1844, published\r\nlikewise some interesting memoranda relating to that island, in the\r\n\"_Nouvelle Annales de la Marine et des Colonies_,\" for November, 1853.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Previous to the resuscitation, after considerable difficulty,\r\nof this important, indeed decisive document, by Mons. L. C. D. Van Dyk,\r\namong the archives of the East and West India Company of Amsterdam, of\r\nwhich he was Librarian, the utmost uncertainty prevailed as to the\r\ndiscovery, name, and geographical position of the two islands. Now,\r\nWilliam Van Flaming, a Dutch navigator, was supposed to be the\r\ndiscoverer,--now, the hardy Van Diemen. Atlases, charts, and books of\r\ntravels, spoke of the name St. Paul belonging, here to the northern\r\nisland, there to the southern. This long-continued confusion of names had\r\nnaturally left ample space for the most contradictory statements as to the\r\nposition, conformation, and geological conditions of both islands. One\r\ntraveller, for instance, describes Amsterdam as an island with good\r\nanchorage on the North side, and an extinct crater, into which ran a\r\nfissure, forming a natural link with the ocean; while, on the other hand,\r\nhe described St. Paul as a desert island, with steeply sloping shores,\r\nwhich make it matter of difficulty, if not utterly impracticable, to\r\neffect a landing; while other voyagers, again, give directly contrary\r\naccounts of both islands.

C. Zhishman, Professor of Geography\r\nand History, in the I. R. Nautical Academy at Trieste.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: \"It seems,\" says Lord Macartney, \"that the Chinese possess\r\nremarkable skill in the dressing of seal-skins, by which they remove the\r\nlong coarse hair, so as to leave merely the soft tender skin, and\r\nsimultaneously manage to render the hide thin and pliant. Only the\r\nprospect of some such enormous profit could at any time induce human\r\nbeings to pass fifteen months at a stretch on so ungenial a spot, which,\r\nmoreover, their occupation must render yet more loathsome. They killed the\r\nseals as they basked in the sun on the rocks along the shore, and around\r\nthe broad natural rock basins. As only the skins were of any value to\r\nthem, they left the flayed carcases exposed to rot on the ground, and\r\nthese lie heaped together here in such masses that it was difficult to\r\navoid treading on them, when one reached the shore of the island. At every\r\nstep some disgusting spectacle presented itself, while an unutterably\r\nnauseous smell of decaying matter poisoned the surrounding atmosphere. In\r\nthe summer months the seals flock hither, all at the same period, in herds\r\nsometimes numbering 800 to 1000, of which usually only about one hundred\r\nare killed at a time. This is the utmost number that five men can skin in\r\nthe course of a single day, it being necessary to peg them together on the\r\nspot, on account of the drying up of the skin. For want of the requisite\r\nvessels only an inconsiderable quantity of the train-oil, which these\r\nanimals contain, is collected. A portion of the best of the blubber is\r\nmelted, and serves these people in lieu of butter. The seal which\r\nfrequents these islands is the Southern or Falkland seal (_Arctocephalus\r\nFalclandicus_ of Gray--_Phoca fusilla_ of Schreber). The female weighs\r\nordinarily from seventy to one hundred and twenty pounds, and is from\r\nthree to five feet long, the male usually considerably larger. In their\r\nnatural state these animals are not particularly timid; sometimes, indeed,\r\nthey plunge all together into the water when any one approaches them; but\r\nquite as often they remain sitting quietly on the rocks, or raise\r\nthemselves erect with a menacing growl. A sharp blow on the snout with a\r\nstick seems sufficient to kill them. Most of those that approach the shore\r\nare females, the proportion they bear to the males being about thirty to\r\none. This apparent disproportion between the sexes, according to\r\nobservation hitherto, is explained as follows:--The Southern seal at\r\ncertain periods often undertakes distant wanderings from one tract to\r\nanother; and certain of these tracts, such as the Cape of Good Hope and\r\nthe islands of St. Paul and Amsterdam, are only frequented by the females\r\nwhen about to bring forth, and by the younger males of the school. In\r\nwinter the huge snouted seal, or Sea Elephant (_Macrorhinus_, \"long\r\nsnout,\" _elephantinus_ of Gray--_Phoca leonina_ of Schreber), which\r\nsometimes attains a length of twenty-five or even thirty feet, comes in\r\ngreat numbers to these islands, where they herd together like sheep in the\r\nnatural coves which the coast is broken into, in which the males announce\r\nthe presence of a herd by a vehement growling, deepening into a loud\r\nroar.\"]\r\n\r\nOwing to the important situation of St. Paul, midway between the\r\nsouthernmost point of Africa and the Australian continent (from each of\r\nwhich it is about 3150 miles distant), a complete, accurate survey of the\r\nisland seemed of great importance, not merely to the scientific world, but\r\nalso in the interests of navigation; as most of the ships bound for China,\r\nAustralia, and New Zealand, as well as the East India liners, pass pretty\r\nclose to these islands, especially during the winter season. Many captains\r\ntrading in the Indian ocean see in St. Paul an advantageous haven for\r\nrecruiting the strength of their scurvy-stricken crews, while the ships of\r\nothers, shattered almost to the point of foundering in the storms of a\r\ntract of ocean where for thousands of miles there is no other land, can\r\nfind here their only prospect of preservation.\r\n\r\nFor the voyagers on board the _Novara_, an interest of an entirely\r\npersonal sort attached to their visit to the island. Among the\r\nunfortunates, who on the 24th August, 1853, suffered shipwreck on the\r\nshores of New Amsterdam, in the British ship _Meridian_, was a native of\r\nBrienz, in Switzerland, named Pfau. This person, together with the\r\ncaptain, Richard Hernamann, and a Frenchman had disappeared, leaving no\r\ntrace, when, on the following morning, the surviving passengers of the\r\nwrecked ship were rescued by a whaler that happened to be cruising in the\r\nneighbourhood. It was supposed that the three unfortunate men had\r\nendeavoured to reach the adjacent island of St. Paul in a small boat, and\r\nprobably were still living there. The father of the Swiss made\r\napplication, through an indirect channel, to the chief of the Expedition,\r\nearnestly requesting him on his visit to the island to institute some\r\nenquiries with the view of finding some trace of his ill-starred son,\r\nstill unwilling to renounce all hope that he might yet be found living at\r\nSt. Paul.\r\n\r\nWe hove to about one mile and a half distant from the great crater-basin,\r\nin whose eastern buttress a natural communication has been opened with the\r\nsea through a breach in its side. When the Dutch captain, William Van\r\nFlaming, cast anchor before the island in 1697, the wearing action of the\r\nwaves had not yet completed this breach, there existing at that period a\r\ndam of some five feet high between the sea and the cavity of the crater.\r\nAt present small boats can, at any hour of the day, pass into the\r\ncrater-basin, protected from the swell of the ocean by two natural\r\nbarriers, which leave between them a passage of about 300 feet wide. Our\r\nlast admeasurement gave a length of 600 feet for the southern barrier, and\r\n1002 feet for that in the north; while the intervening water passage\r\nmeasured 306 feet in breadth, with a depth of 9.6 feet at high water, and\r\nfrom 2 to 3 feet at ebb tide. On the north side of the entrance to the\r\nstraits stands a lofty pyramidal rock, called Nine-Pin Rock, round which\r\ncircle innumerable sea-fowl, which to all appearance brood among the\r\nchinks and crannies of the rock, while in the water below crowds of sharks\r\nlash the water into foam. It must be highly dangerous hereabouts to be\r\ncapsized in a boat, as there would be little possibility of any one being\r\nrescued, no matter how speedily assistance might be rendered.\r\n\r\nScarcely were we anchored, ere we in the ship perceived a boat approaching\r\nfrom the island, which rapidly neared the frigate, with three men who had\r\ntaken up their abode in even this desolate wilderness. Our imagination\r\ndeluded us with the pleasing idea that these three forlorn, forsaken\r\nfigures might be the long lost men wrecked in the _Meridian_, whom pitying\r\nbillows might have wafted to this solitary island.\r\n\r\nPresently there stepped on deck by the side-ropes a grizzly figure, with\r\ndeeply-furrowed features and long, grey beard, clothed in a blue blouse\r\nand coarse linen trowsers, that seemed to have weathered many a winter's\r\nstorm. This primitive-looking old man proved to be a Frenchman named Viot,\r\nwho had lived here for a considerable time as overseer of a fishing\r\nestablishment on the island. Our first question had reference to the\r\nmissing men from the _Meridian_. But how sore was our disappointment when\r\nthe old sailor in the blouse told us he knew all the particulars of the\r\ncatastrophe of the ship, but that he had never come across the slightest\r\ntrace of the three unfortunates whom we had enquired about. Viot had\r\nvisited the island regularly every year since 1841, except that in which\r\nthe _Meridian_ had been lost. The fate of these three shipwrecked men must\r\ntherefore remain for ever undetermined, although, considering the\r\ntempestuous weather which usually prevails in the Indian Ocean in the\r\nmonth of August, it is highly improbable that a boat of such small\r\ndimensions as that to which the captain and his two unhappy\r\nfellow-travellers committed themselves, could reach St. Paul, which was\r\ndistant 42 miles from the spot at which the ship was wrecked.\r\n\r\nAbout 11.30 A.M. the naturalists, accompanied by the officers appointed\r\nto assist in the scientific operations, proceeded in two boats to the\r\nshore, for the purpose of making some preliminary observations. When we\r\nreached the bar there opened to our view, covered with luxurious grass\r\ngrowing in tufts, the walls of a majestic crater, the exquisite regularity\r\nof the cavity of which left the exact impression of an enormous natural\r\namphitheatre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTANT VIEW OF CRATER-BASIN OF ST. PAUL.]\r\n\r\nOn either side the ground rises nearly perpendicularly to a height of\r\nabout 800 feet, which probably is likewise the average height of the walls\r\nof the crater. On the north side of the basin, a kind of terrace was seen\r\nlow down, with huts thatched with straw, while on the shingle of the bar\r\nwas planted a not very perpendicular flagstaff, on which, in honour of the\r\narrival of a ship of war, old Viot had run up the French ensign. As the\r\n_Novara's_ boat swept into the crater-basin, he saluted with the\r\nproverbial courtesy of his nation, which not even the rough occupation of\r\na whale-fisher had been able to rub out of him. Viot had last come hither\r\nin the preceding March, with a mulatto and a negro on board of a fishing\r\ncraft, named the _Alliance_, of 45 tons, in which he had sailed from St.\r\nDenis, on the Island of Bourbon, anew to take charge of the little fishing\r\nstation here, which is at present the property of M. Ottovan, a French\r\ngentleman domiciliated in St. Denis.\r\n\r\nWhile at Cape Town we were informed, in reply to our enquiries, by the\r\nfirst authority in the country, that the Island of St. Paul belonged to\r\nEngland, and was a dependency of the Mauritius; here, to our astonishment,\r\nwe on the other hand learned from the inhabitants that St. Paul at present\r\nwas under the protection of the French Government, and, in fact, was an\r\nappendage of the Island of Bourbon, the governor of which long previously\r\nhad ordered the French flag to be hoisted, with all the naval formalities,\r\nby a detachment of French soldiers who had been landed from a French ship\r\nof war. According to Viot--who is to all appearance a thoroughly\r\ntrustworthy man, but on whom, however, we throw the responsibility of the\r\ncorrectness of the following information,--the island seems, in fact, to\r\nhave been, some twenty years since, the property of a French merchant of\r\nSt. Denis, named Camin, who somewhat later entered into partnership with a\r\nperson named Adam, a Pole by birth, to whom he ultimately resigned the\r\nentire island.[59] Adam, who was described to us as a man of exceedingly\r\nfierce and determined character, did wonders for the cultivation of the\r\nisland. He left a number of Mozambique negroes, whom he compelled to work\r\nthrough the entire year, exposed to the severest privations, and employed\r\nin hewing stone from the rocks, with which huts were erected, in preparing\r\na landing-quay on the north side of the basin, and in sowing a number of\r\nplots of ground along the lower margin of the crater with European\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: According to Captain Denham, who visited this island in 1853,\r\nthe present proprietor called this fishing station, Marie Heurtevent, and\r\nsaid he had bought it about five years previously for 6000 dollars from a\r\nPolish merchant of St. Denis, where he himself also resided. (_Nautical\r\nMagazine_, pp. 68, 75).]\r\n\r\nAbout eight or ten years since, Adam (who afterwards, in the course of a\r\nvoyage from Bourbon to New Zealand, met a disgraceful death, having been\r\nthrown overboard for his cruelty by the black crew of a small vessel, whom\r\nhe had driven to desperation) sold the islands to their present possessor,\r\nM. Ottovan, a ship-chandler of St. Denis, who since then has twice each\r\nyear, during the fine season, despatched a small craft of some 30 to 45\r\ntons, manned by from 15 to 18 fishermen, from St. Denis to St. Paul\r\nIsland, so as to turn to advantage the unusual abundance of this\r\nfishing-ground. This vessel leaves St. Denis regularly every November on\r\nits voyage of from 24 to 30 days to St. Paul. The return voyage to St.\r\nDenis takes place during the prevalence of the South-East Trades, and\r\noccupies a much shorter time, rarely exceeding 14 to 16 days. The fishing\r\nsloop, during its stay at the island, anchors inside the basin of the\r\ncrater, so as to discharge her provisions for the fishermen, and to\r\nfacilitate the freighting for the homeward voyage with the fish that have\r\nbeen caught, as also to guard her against sudden changes of weather, which\r\nin these latitudes, as we ourselves experienced, is, even during the best\r\nseason, very stormy and dangerous. The fishermen use the excellent\r\nwhaleboats (or _baleinières_), so admirably suited to the heavy swell of\r\nthe Indian Ocean, in which they go out in the morning, returning to the\r\nshore at nightfall. The species of fish which is found in greatest\r\nnumbers, and is caught exclusively by the hook, is usually called by the\r\nfishermen, \"Indian Cod:\" it is by no means, however, of the _genus_\r\nHaddock, and very slightly, if at all, resembles the codfish of northern\r\nwaters, or common stock-fish, but seems to belong to the class of finger\r\nfish (_cheilo-dactylus-fasciatus_), which is usually classed among the\r\ncrow fish (_sciænæ_). These are salted, dried in the open air, packed in\r\ncasks, and dispatched in large quantities to the markets of St. Denis. It\r\nis calculated that the number thus sent off in the course of each year\r\namounts to about 40,000. which are sold in the market of St. Denis by the\r\nhundred, for from 40 to 60 francs (£1 12s. to £2 8s.--total £640 to £960).\r\nThe expenses of maintaining the settlement is very small.--Viot has 57\r\nfrancs a month (£2 6s.); his two companions 40 francs and 25 francs\r\nrespectively (£1 12s. and £1); the men engaged in the fishery receive 25\r\nto 30 francs a month, besides provisions. The second voyage of the vessel\r\nordinarily takes place in January or February, so as to return in April or\r\nMay, with a similar cargo. It often happens that the owner of the vessel\r\nfinds some more profitable employment for it, when it only returns during\r\nthe second year, and their provisions, as meal, rice, biscuit, tobacco,\r\n&c., get rather short. The settlers, however, employ what leisure time\r\nremains after their work is done, in cultivating a number of plots of\r\nground with cereals and vegetables, potatoes especially returning from\r\ntime to time an excellent yield. Of these useful tubers, which grow with\r\nremarkable luxuriance in the turf-soil of the island, they raise from 60\r\nto 80 cwt. annually. Fresh vegetables being articles in great request are\r\nmore particularly made available by the inhabitants of St. Paul, by way of\r\nbarter, when trafficking with the whalers, from 20 to 30 of which touch\r\nhere in the year, to exchange their salt fish, rice, tobacco, cheese,\r\nbrandy, &c., for the fresh provisions grown on the island. The number of\r\nvessels that pass within sight of St. Paul in the course of a year may be\r\nreckoned at from 100 to 150, of which, however, only a very few, except\r\nthe whalers, visit the island.[60] In the year 1857, for example, it\r\noccurred only twice (one case being an English man-of-war), that passing\r\nships sent boats to the island, five months of the year having elapsed in\r\nthe first instance, and two in the second.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: All the Dutch Indiamen on the home voyage from Batavia,\r\nduring the months of October till May, have been for many years in the\r\nhabit of running south till they sighted St. Paul, so as to catch the S.\r\nE. Trades. But it has never been the policy of the Dutch to attract\r\nattention to the eastern seas, and accordingly no information found its\r\nway to Europe respecting these interesting islands, till the period\r\nmentioned in the text.]\r\n\r\nWhen the take of fish in the immediate vicinity of the island does not\r\nseem sufficiently remunerative, the fishermen occasionally launch out to\r\ngreater distances. They then bring out from the basin of the crater the\r\nbarque that brought them from Bourbon to St. Paul, and remain at sea for\r\nseveral days, or make for the adjoining island of Amsterdam, the shores\r\nof which are even more frequented by the fish than those of St. Paul.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, our first movements were directed solely towards an\r\nexamination of its physical features. We were accompanied on this tour of\r\ninspection by Ferdinand, an active, intelligent Mulatto, with thoroughly\r\nFrench manners. The French stock has this peculiarity as compared with the\r\nGerman, that it remains unmistakably French, even when mixed with\r\ntwo-thirds African blood. Ferdinand was for the first time in St. Paul,\r\nhaving been conveyed hither in the _Alliance_ in the previous March, to\r\nwork for M. Ottovan. Family troubles had been the cause of his banishment\r\nto this dismal island. Although only 24 years of age, he was already the\r\nfather of two children, whom, he informed us, he had placed at school in\r\nSt. Denis; and in sheer despair at the worthless conduct of their mother,\r\nhad hired himself hither as a labourer at 40 francs a month, paid by the\r\nowner of the island. He proposed returning to St. Denis in the next ship\r\nthat left St. Paul, in the hope that peace might be by that time restored\r\nin his family.\r\n\r\nAt various spots in the lower rim of the crater-basin, within which\r\nFerdinand acted as guide, we perceived heavy volumes of smoke emerging\r\nfrom the shallow parts of the water, which obviously implied the existence\r\nof hot springs. The two most active and largest in circumference were on\r\nthe north side of the crater-basin, and were known, the one as the Bath,\r\nthe other as the Drinking Fountain. Moreover, at several points on the\r\nnorth bar, hot water bubbles up from the soil, of such a temperature that\r\nthe same person who, with a hook and line had caught a fish in the cold\r\nwater basin, might, with the same motion of his hand, let them drop into\r\nthe hot adjoining spring, where, in fact, it is boiled within a few\r\nminutes and fit for eating! We have ourselves made this experiment, which\r\nis also mentioned by Lord Macartney, and found the fish thus prepared\r\nexceedingly palatable.\r\n\r\nAt high water the whole of the hot springs become mingled with the brine\r\nof the ocean, and thus indicate a temperature which is barely perceptibly\r\nhigher than that of the latter. Adjoining the landing-place, several late\r\nvisitors to the island have endeavoured to perpetuate the record of their\r\nfleeting presence on some compact granite blocks of rock, which are\r\nscattered in the path to the hot springs. Thus, on one of those stones,\r\nfast becoming obliterated by the weather, may be read:--\"Savouret, 1841\"--\r\n\"J. D. Rogers, 1855, Mars.\"--On a second huge block:--\"Hte. Rogers, 1852\r\nto 1857;\" and lastly, these names, with difficulty decipherable,\r\n\"Pallefournier-Emile, Mazarni-Denoyarez, Grenoble, Canton de Sassenage,\r\nDépartement de l'Isère, 1844.\" In general we found none of the\r\ninscriptions on the island that can be recognized.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the plateau above, which is reached by a narrow, steep, and in\r\nmany places rather fatiguing path, from the settlers' huts on the north\r\nside of the basin of the crater, we came to a breeding-place of the\r\nyellow-tufted \"Crested or Hopping-Penguin\"[61] (_apterodytes chrysocome_)\r\nin which we found at the lowest estimate from 500 to 600 of these singular\r\ncreatures, which are adorned with grey-yellow tufts of feathers arranged\r\nin a semicircle above the eyes, and which, as was well remarked by the\r\nnaturalist attached to the _Lion_, with the peculiar plumage and the\r\nalmost scaly covering of their fin-like wings, suggest a remote\r\nresemblance to the form of a fish. Living part of the year in the water,\r\nand passing most of the remainder on land, Nature has, in a manner,\r\nadapted them for these widely differing modes of life. The dirty\r\ngreyish-brown attire of the young contrasts so strongly with the gay\r\nplumage of the old penguin, that at the first glance they hardly seem to\r\nbelong to the same species. The females lay only one or two eggs, usually\r\nin October, so that at the time of our visit, the young were only about a\r\nmonth-and-a-half or so old. These penguins, so graceful and nimble in the\r\nwater, as if it were their proper element, are very awkward on land, so as\r\nto be easily caught, or knocked down with a stick. Only in so doing it is\r\nnecessary to be on one's guard against a blow from their long sharp bills,\r\nwith which they can inflict on their pursuer a by no means trifling wound.\r\nIn the course of centuries, during which they have paid undisturbed visits\r\nto this island, they have trodden a well-marked path from their\r\nbreeding-place to the edge of the sea; and it is a proof of the wonderful\r\ninstinct of this creature, that this place is almost the only point on\r\nthe entire island, at which it would be possible for it to reach the sea.\r\nA flock of these hopping penguins presents an odd and peculiar appearance,\r\nas, after leisurely bathing in the sea, and providing a sufficient supply\r\nof food for their young, their elegant heads emerge from the water, when\r\ncarefully calculating the effect of the breakers, they ride their crest\r\nand allow themselves to be deposited on the beach; or, after hopping from\r\nstone to stone, the plumes on their heads nodding to and fro, suddenly\r\nplunge headforemost into the sea, like so many somersault-throwers! Not\r\nless diverting are the movements of these animals when, returned from\r\ntheir laborious wanderings, which they undertake two or three times a day\r\nin search of food for their young, they bend their tottering steps back to\r\nthe roosting-place, waddling in their walk like ducks. One always leads\r\nthe way as guide and forager-in-chief, and the rest, usually from ten to\r\nfifteen in number, follow him in a column; on reaching the roosting-place,\r\na piece of level winding ground, they give a shrill cry, and comport\r\nthemselves anything but peaceably towards their neighbours, especially if\r\nthese have possessed themselves of their accustomed seats. Continual\r\nsquabbling and disputing go on, and their croaking and screaming are\r\nprolonged far into the silence of night. They show much tenderness for\r\ntheir young, shelter them with great care, and defend them with\r\nextraordinary courage and pertinacity against the southern hawk gull[62]\r\n(_stercorarius antarcticus_), which frequently swoops upon the\r\nbreeding-ground, and even ventures within reach of man, from whom it\r\ndefends itself by violently striking and biting with its beak. Always at\r\nwar under ordinary circumstances, they are nevertheless the most faithful\r\nof allies in moments of common danger or necessity. The flesh of the old\r\npenguin has so rank a smell that it is only used by those frequenting the\r\nisland in case of the most extraordinary necessity; that of the young, on\r\nthe other hand, has a far more agreeable flavour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Called also the \"_Jumping Jack_\" by the English sailors, from\r\nits custom of jumping quite out of the water, like a porpoise, on its\r\nencountering the slightest obstacle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Called by the English sailors \"Port Egmont Hens\" from their\r\nfrequenting Port Egmont in the Falkland Isles. They seem to be identical\r\nin species with the \"skua,\" or \"bonxie\" of the Shetlands.]\r\n\r\nThe breeding-place of the penguin is about 300 feet above the level of the\r\nwater in the basin of the crater.[63] Four hundred feet more of laborious,\r\nsteep scrambling, brings the adventurer to the plateau at last, from the\r\nhighest peaks of which he readily obtains a view of the greater part of\r\nthe island, which is utterly treeless. At many places we found the ground\r\nquite warm, and at one slimy tract, about 600 feet wide, which was noticed\r\nby the naturalists on board the _Lion_, there was positive danger of\r\nsinking several feet into the hot, yielding soil, if we did not advance\r\nwith great care. On the other hand, the fierce tongues of flame, which\r\nLord Macartney alleged were visible at night from the deck of the ship,\r\nand which greatly resembled the celebrated nocturnal fires of Pietra Mala,\r\nin the mountains between Florence and Bologna, were nowhere visible, at\r\nleast during the time we were on the island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: A second breeding-place, somewhat larger, but much more\r\ninaccessible than that described, occurs on the north-west side of the\r\nisland. There among rugged fantastically broken masses of rock, these\r\nextraordinary creatures can sun themselves undisturbed, and have hardly\r\nanything to dread from the destroying hand of man, who could only get\r\nthither with much difficulty, and not without peril to life, by clambering\r\nalong the face of a precipitous wall of rock.]\r\n\r\nOn the north-west side of the islands, facing the sea, two lofty pinnacles\r\nof scoriæ, with truncated summits, rise in cones of such exquisite\r\nregularity of form as speedily attracted the attention of our geologist,\r\nand became somewhat later the chief scene of his activity. In the\r\nimmediate vicinity, many traces of lava-streams are visible, which plainly\r\nshow the direction in which their currents had flowed. From the upper edge\r\nof the great basin of the crater the ground slopes gradually to the sea,\r\nending abruptly in a precipice, descending sheer 150 or 200 feet into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid retracing our steps by the same path, we directed our\r\nguide, the ever active Ferdinand, to conduct us back to the shore by some\r\nother track than that by which we had clambered up to this point;\r\nwhereupon he stopped at a point of the upper rim of the crater, where the\r\nground fell suddenly away quite perpendicular, grasped the rich luxuriant\r\ngrass hand over hand, and having proceeded a few steps, invited us to\r\nfollow. At the first glance we involuntarily recoiled at the bare idea of\r\ndescending into the abyss by such a route, but presently we found our\r\nadvance less dangerous and appalling than had at first appeared, when it\r\nwas found we might, without any misgiving, let ourselves down by the long\r\ntough grass, the strong stalks of which supplied a safe means of descent.\r\n\r\nIn less than three-quarters of an hour we had descended from the upper\r\nmargin of the crater to the settlement, and at once proceeded on our\r\nreturn to the frigate. A pretty fresh N.W. breeze had sprung up in the\r\nmeantime, which rendered our re-embarkation in our small short boats,\r\ntotally unsuited to the tremendous swell of the Indian Ocean, exceedingly\r\nuncomfortable. Arrived at the ship's side, the sea ran so high, and had so\r\nincreased the difficulty of laying the boats alongside, that we at first\r\nendeavoured to reach the deck by the Jacob's ladders suspended at the\r\npoop. When, however, one of the sailors (who confessedly have much greater\r\nreadiness in clambering than ordinary mortals), while holding on to one of\r\nthe ladders, was reached by a tremendous wave, and half his body being in\r\nthe water, ran a risk of being carried off by a shark, the scientific\r\ngentlemen in the boats preferred making for the starboard side of the\r\nship, whence they reached their haven of refuge by the man-ropes.\r\n\r\nAlthough this accident sufficiently manifested the impracticability of our\r\noriginal plan of returning every evening on board, and of being able to\r\nremain beside the ship during the carrying out of the objects of our\r\nvisit, no man supposed as yet that, at this season, the summer of St.\r\nPaul's, the weather might suddenly become so stormy and generally\r\nunfavourable, as thus early to necessitate our re-embarkation, and that\r\nthe ship would be compelled, with all speed, to leave her anchorage, and\r\nput to sea for a week under most uncomfortable circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn 20th November, about 6 A.M., the officers and naturalists, together\r\nwith a portion of the crew, 32 in all, left the frigate with a large\r\nquantity of instruments, scientific apparatus, and baggage. This little\r\nexpedition was supplied with provisions and water for six days, there\r\nbeing no springs of fresh water on the island, the frequenters of which\r\nare compelled to depend for their whole supply of drinking-water, partly\r\non the rain-fall, partly during long-continued dry seasons on the water of\r\none of the hot brackish springs which occur on the north side of the lower\r\ncircuit of the crater. Long accustomed to these fluids and to their\r\npeculiar taste, the inhabitants feel no evil results from their\r\nemployment, which very probably would not be the case with those persons\r\nwho visit the island for the first time, and whose arduous exertions\r\nnecessitate their drinking daily large quantities of water.\r\n\r\nOn a small eminence, about 150 feet high, above the fisherman's huts on\r\nthe north side of the crater-basin, a small wooden cottage was erected for\r\nthe protection of the astronomers; and at a distance of about 40 feet, a\r\nsecond for the magnetic instruments, both of which, with their contents,\r\nwere entrusted to Lieutenant Robert Müller. Lieutenants Batlogg and Eugen\r\nKronowetter, were respectively entrusted with the observations by\r\ntheodolite, and with the surveying board. To the last-mentioned gentleman\r\nwere also confided the observations with the meteorological instruments,\r\nthe researches with the tide-gauge, the instruments for measuring the\r\nvelocity of currents, as also the soundings in the basin, and on either\r\nside of the bar,--to assist him in the execution of which Cadet Count\r\nBorelli and Head Quartermaster Cian were detached. We quartered ourselves\r\nas well as we could in the wretched filthy huts which, in summer, serve\r\nthe fishermen from St. Denis as a shelter. In one of these hung several\r\npictures--one representing Napoleon I. riding the inevitable white horse,\r\nthe majority consisting of female portraits and scenes of Parisian life,\r\nso that the whole place had quite a Frenchified appearance.\r\n\r\nHardly had the instruments, apparatus, men, and baggage been placed under\r\nshelter, when once more a strong north wind came on, which, during the\r\nnight between the 20th and 21st, increased to such a height, that it blew\r\ndown the two huts intended for the observations, which had not been quite\r\nfinished, and in which, fortunately, the instruments had not yet been\r\nplaced--exposing the work already begun to very considerable interruption.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, a whaler approached the island, and sent one of her\r\nboats off for fresh provisions. She proved to be the _Herald_, of New\r\nBedford, Massachusetts, U. S., out 27 months, and expecting to require to\r\nremain out 11 months longer, in order to complete her lading of oil and\r\nwhalebone. She was last from St. Augustin's Bay (Madagascar), which place\r\nshe had left two months previously. When the captain, who chanced to be in\r\nthe boat, saw the activity of the scientific corps, the results of which\r\nwere already beginning to be visible in the hitherto deserted island, he\r\nsaid that one of his crew had fallen from the mast a few days previously,\r\nand severely injured himself, and forthwith asked whether we could render\r\nhim any surgical assistance. Considering the precarious circumstances\r\nunder which we ourselves were on the island, we judged it more advisable\r\nto receive the unfortunate whaler on board the frigate, where we could\r\ngive him all necessary assistance. As we afterwards learned, the surgeon\r\nof the frigate, Dr. Ruschitztha, notwithstanding the inclemency of the\r\nweather, was ordered from the frigate, and had the satisfaction of\r\nrendering valuable assistance to the invalid.\r\n\r\nThe foul weather continued all day, and during the night of the 21st, it\r\nbecame so tempestuous that the frigate was at last compelled to put to\r\nsea. About 3.30 A.M. she began to labour heavily with an unusually high\r\nsea and frequent shifts of wind, accompanied by showers of rain, after a\r\nheavy blow from the N.W., so that at first it was thought on board that\r\none of these furious gusts, which for several hours past had followed each\r\nother at regular intervals, had sprung the cable, and that the anchor\r\nwould be lost. The jib accordingly was hoisted, and the fore-topsail set\r\nwith four reefs in it, and an attempt made to weigh anchor. This\r\noperation, at all times laborious, was now especially so, and seemed as\r\nthough it would never have an end. Although the capstan was manned, as\r\nalready said, at 3.30, it was not till past seven, or four hours later\r\nthat the anchor hove in sight. It was the port anchor that had been\r\nweighed, and it was now perceived that one of the flukes had given way,\r\nand was entirely broken off. In such stormy weather it seemed very\r\nuncertain whether the anchor could be brought on board, as it struck with\r\nmuch force against the ship-side, in consequence of her severe rolling,\r\nand it was only secured at great risk to the life of the men employed. The\r\ncable was unbent, and the anchor slipped, so as to relieve the ship (for\r\nwhich the anchor still on board was sufficient in the meantime), from the\r\nvehement thumping. The frigate now had to encounter a regular\r\nNorth-wester, and only after three days of the most furious rolling or\r\npitching, was she able, aided by northerly breezes, again to reach her\r\nformer anchorage. The members of the Expedition, left at St. Paul to\r\nprosecute their scientific labours, occasionally experienced a somewhat\r\npeculiar feeling when the frigate, owing to the severity of the weather,\r\nremained invisible during these three long days; and fancy involuntarily\r\ndepicted themselves in the position of men whom the stormy waves of\r\ndestiny had cast away on this lonely island in the Indian Ocean, there\r\nperhaps to languish for weary months out of reach of assistance or means\r\nof rescue.\r\n\r\nOld Viot, who had come for the sixth time to the island, alleged that such\r\nrainy tempestuous weather at this season of the year was quite an unusual\r\nphenomenon,--an opinion which somewhat later was confirmed by the reports\r\nof several North American whalers. Ordinarily the fine season commences at\r\nthe beginning of November, at which period the South wind is the most\r\nprevalent, the sky often remaining clear and hot for weeks together. The\r\nhottest month of the year is January, the coldest June. From May to\r\nOctober it is exceedingly difficult to land with boats on the island, and\r\ncases not unfrequently occur during the continuance of the stormy season\r\nresembling that which is instanced by the historiographer of Lord\r\nMacartney's embassy to China, in which, during September, 1792, a ship\r\nanchored on the east side of the island, was only able twice, during the\r\nlapse of eight weeks, to send a boat to the island with provisions. On\r\nthis station the fishery is confined to the fine season (from November to\r\nApril), while for the rest of the year the various huts of the fishermen\r\nare entirely abandoned, being only inhabited by a couple of men, in whose\r\ncharge are left the few but by no means valueless implements and apparatus\r\nof the island. These men lead a very monotonous life, though not one of\r\nprivation, for the crater-basin supplies the whole year round the most\r\ndelicious fish, and craw-fish of the finest kind.\r\n\r\nOur sailors used to hang a basket with bait close to the edge of the\r\ncrater-basin, sunk a few feet in the water, which they would draw out\r\nevery time full of lobsters. In a few hours they frequently caught from\r\neighty to one hundred pounds' weight of these large and extremely delicate\r\nspecies of shell-fish. An excursion which was got up one morning to the\r\nSouth side of the island, in a fisherman's boat, was rewarded in a few\r\nhours with some fifty different sorts of denizens of the deep, some of\r\nwhich weighed twenty to twenty-five pounds each.\r\n\r\nAccording to Viot's account, snow does not fall often in winter, and in\r\nconsequence of the heat inherent in the volcanic soil, never lies long on\r\nit. On the other hand, hail is a tolerably frequent visitant. Rain is of\r\nconstant occurrence, and sometimes falls in immense quantities. Viot was\r\nnever weary of expressing his astonishment at the enormous size of the\r\ndrops of rain which for many a year he had seen fall at St. Paul. The cold\r\nis often pretty severe; while the almost entire want of firing on the\r\nisland (for the dung of animals is not obtainable in sufficient quantities\r\nto make its storing worth the requisite labour), deprives the poor\r\nresidents of the comfort of a fireside. \"If the last storm had not blown\r\ndown our hut, we should for long have had to do without fuel,\" was the\r\nnaïve remark on one occasion of the old Frenchman, as he lay stretched out\r\non a dirty bed, carefully rolled up in his rough woollen blanket. Winter\r\nbegins in May and ends in September. During this period the Northerly\r\nwinds are often very strong. On 27th June, 1857, there blew for six or\r\neight hours here so terrific a tempest that the inhabitants of St. Paul\r\ndid not venture outside of their huts for fear of being rapt away by the\r\nwind. These storms of winter occasionally rage to such a degree that they\r\ndrive before them into the basin of the crater huge masses of water, which\r\nthey whirl in wild confusion to an enormous height, showing that the tract\r\nin the Southern Ocean traversed by the hurricanes which occasionally do\r\nsuch damage about Mauritius and Rodriguez, occasionally embraces the\r\nislands of St. Paul and Amsterdam. In November, at the commencement of the\r\nfine season, the winds are rather variable, and so continue to the end of\r\nMarch, when the N. and N.W. winds begin once more to blow regularly; these\r\nbring heavy rains and foul weather, after which, except that it is cold\r\nwhen the wind changes to West with a Southerly tendency, a warmer and\r\ndrier climate is experienced. During our stay we frequently had an\r\nopportunity of verifying by observation the steady return of certain winds\r\nin regular succession. For instance, after the N.E. wind had prevailed for\r\nsome days, it veered to N.N.W. whence it invariably went to W. by S.,\r\nwhere it usually stayed some little time, after which it once more went to\r\nN.E.--a phenomenon which went through its phases every six days with\r\nsurprising regularity.\r\n\r\nThere are heavy mists during autumn, but thunder on the other hand is far\r\nfrom frequent, nor is it particularly violent when it occurs. During a\r\nresidence of eighteen days we never saw the centigrade thermometer stand\r\nhigher than 66°·2 Fahr., or lower than 53°·6 Fahr. Lord Macartney gave 62°\r\nFahr. as the average of the thermometer during his visit in February,\r\n1793.\r\n\r\nAs for earthquakes, a phenomenon whose occurrence at St. Paul would\r\npossess an uncommon interest, Viot averred that during sixteen years that\r\nhe had visited the island, off and on, he neither himself had perceived\r\nany indications of one, nor had he at any time heard of any such having\r\nbeen observed.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, Ferdinand (who, nevertheless, had lived but eight months\r\non the island) affirmed that his predecessor, Rosemond, had told him of\r\nshocks, comparatively slight it is true, which he (Rosemond) had felt\r\nduring his several years' abode here. Considering the small circumference\r\nof the island, and the violent surf on its shores, slight oscillations may\r\nnot improbably be felt, which are caused by other than volcanic agencies.\r\nMoreover, on the outer margin of the crater-basin, the island presents at\r\nthose numerous points, from which at ebb-tide roll volumes of smoke and\r\nsteam, so many natural vents for the escape of the confined subterraneous\r\ngases, that in their ordinary state, and so long as they continue open, in\r\nfuture, there is no especial reason to suppose there will be any\r\nupheavings of the earth's crust in consequence of volcanic agencies. The\r\nearthquake of 14th August, 1857, which was pretty severely felt in Cape\r\nTown and the vicinity, does not seem to have included St. Paul within the\r\ncircle of its influence. The present inhabitants of St. Paul, at all\r\nevents, unanimously assert that they cannot recall having perceived,\r\neither on the 14th August, or at any time about that period, any shocks of\r\nearthquake whatever, or to have observed any unusual appearances either in\r\nthe surface of the earth or in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe purposely say \"at any time about that period,\" because the inhabitants\r\nof the island do not avail themselves of that assistance so universal\r\nnow-a-days of a printed calendar, but trust to memory for keeping a\r\nreckoning of the flight of time. That mistakes should frequently occur\r\nwith such a method of computing time is rendered the more probable that\r\nnot one of the three denizens of the island can write. For instance, we\r\nonce remarked to our worthy Viot that by his own reckoning he had marked\r\none day more than he had actually lived. \"We always get into a mess with\r\nthese confounded months of thirty-one days!\" was the good-humoured reply\r\nof the ancient wanderer from Nantes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the volcanic soil of St. Paul is everywhere especially adapted\r\nfor scientific study, it nevertheless presents few objects with which to\r\nenrich collections of natural history. An island, on which not a single\r\ntree or bush is to be found, and on whose tufa soil, though well adapted\r\nfor fruit, only a few grasses, ferns, and mosses thrive, must, so far as\r\nregards the value of his researches, prove as little interesting to the\r\nbotanist as the zoologist, who, as we shall see more circumstantially\r\nfurther on, came across but few representatives here of the animated\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nAt several places, the practical gardener who accompanied the frigate was\r\nordered to plant a number of European vegetables and anti-scorbutic\r\nplants, such as cabbage, horse-radish, turnips, of various assorted\r\nspecies, celery, garden-cress, and spoonwort,[64] it is to be hoped with\r\nfavourable results. At all events, we had the satisfaction during our\r\nstay, of seeing the tender shoots of some of the vegetables already\r\nsprouting through the surface of the earth. At that time there were not\r\nabove a dozen or so cultivated spots on the Island; if, however, these are\r\ncarefully cultivated, they can always furnish enough excellent nourishing\r\nprovision for from 80 to 100 men. A quantity of potatoes, from 6 to 8\r\nsacks, planted in June, yield, in January or February, a crop of from 60\r\nto 80 casks of 100 lbs. each, or between 3 and 4 tons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: The vegetables planted were as follows:--_Brassica rapa_\r\n(rape); _Brassica oleracea capitata_ (sea kail); _Brassica rapa alba_\r\n(white turnip); _Brassica rapa flava_ (yellow turnip); _Raphanus sativus_\r\n(radish); _Lepidium sativum_ (dittandu); _Cochleæia officinalis_ (scurvy\r\ngrass).]\r\n\r\nWheat, maize, and barley, also thrive at St. Paul, and their cultivation\r\nhas only been discontinued, in consequence of their conversion into bread\r\nrequiring a much larger amount of fuel than is at the command of the\r\nresidents. On the other hand, all attempts to cultivate beans and peas\r\nhave utterly failed hitherto. All kinds of nutritive plants give but one\r\ncrop in the year. So also several kinds of trees, which promised to grow\r\nwell, considering the resemblance between the climate here and that to\r\nwhich they were indigenous--such as _Pinus maritima_, various kinds of\r\n_Protea_, &c., and the successful rearing of which would ultimately prove\r\nan extraordinary benefit to all who frequent the island, in consequence of\r\nthe great scarcity of firewood--were planted as seedlings by the gardener\r\nattached to the Expedition, in the vicinity of the two huts used for the\r\nobservations. Assuredly it will not be one of the least important benefits\r\nof the _Novara_ Expedition, which it will have conferred on St. Paul, if\r\nthe growth of the seedlings, planted in its soil with such a noble purpose\r\nin view, should result in the gradual and at all events partial clothing\r\nof the island in the forest.\r\n\r\nAs to the Fauna of St. Paul, there appears to be one kind of sea-swallow\r\n(_storna_) not hitherto described, the bill and feet of which are of a\r\ncoral-red colour, and delicate silver-grey plumage, undoubtedly the most\r\nbeautiful of the feathered inhabitants, as the penguin is the most\r\nextraordinary and peculiar creature on the island. Besides these there is\r\nalso a pretty grey diver (_Prion Vittatus_), which builds its nest among\r\nthe rocks; also a brown gull (_Stercorarius antarcticus_), as also three\r\nkinds of albatrosses (_Diomedea exulans_, _D. fuliginosa_, _D.\r\nchlororhinchos_).\r\n\r\nThe Crater-basin was somewhat less unproductive than the dry land. The\r\ndepth is from 100 to 175 feet. Close to the edge, the sounding line gave a\r\ndepth of 10 fathoms (60 feet). Experiments with the dredging-net, although\r\nfrequently made, gave by no means satisfactory results. On the other hand,\r\nthe rod and line brought up many an interesting addition to our\r\ncollection, and frequent strolls at ebb-tide along the barely uncovered\r\nmasses of rock that skirted the basin of the crater were rewarded with\r\nnumerous discoveries of specimens of conchology. In the centre of the\r\nbasin we came upon slimy ground at a depth of 204 feet; near the hot\r\nsprings (about 100 feet distant), 19 fathoms (114 feet); and at a third\r\npoint, on the south side, 23 fathoms (138 feet). Viot said, that after\r\nrepeated soundings at different points, he had found the depth of the\r\nbasin varied from 10 to 35 fathoms (60 to 210 feet). The seals\r\n(_Arctocephalus Falclandicus_) of which, according to Macartney, at the\r\nend of last century, thousands daily came to the coast of the island to\r\nbask in the sun, have almost entirely disappeared, so that these animals\r\nare very rarely seen or captured by the inhabitants. Even of the skeletons\r\nof these marine mammals, which, when the naturalists of the _Lion_ were\r\nroaming through the island, used to lie about in such numbers that one\r\ncould almost walk upon bones all round the crater, not a vestige is left,\r\nand one can hardly realize that formerly hundreds of thousands of these\r\nanimals were slaughtered at this island.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the quadrupeds of the island are domestic animals that have\r\nbeen brought hither from Europe and the French colonies--such as swine,\r\ngoats, cats, rabbits--which at present live here in a wild state. The\r\ngoats, which were first introduced in 1844, are most numerous on the N.W.\r\nof the island; the swine, on the contrary, are not so frequently met with.\r\nDuring our residence, a boar and a wild cat were killed; a few days after,\r\nthe five young of the cat were found, having been compelled to emerge from\r\ntheir lair in search of food. A female hare, which we had brought from\r\nCape Town, was also set free on the island, and it was fortunate for the\r\npropagation of these useful animals that there was already a male hare on\r\nthe island. A pair of geese was also presented to the colonists, which\r\nperhaps have continued to breed there.\r\n\r\nAs we thought the island was uninhabited, it was originally our intention\r\nto leave several kinds of domestic animals of different sexes with a view\r\nto propagation; and with that object, when at Cape Town had made various\r\npurchases of useful animals; but, under the circumstances, we relinquished\r\nthis intention, as there seemed but little chance of their being left\r\nundisturbed sufficiently long to secure the desired object. Occasionally\r\ncows would be landed from the whalers for the sake of the fresh fodder,\r\nand taken away again after the lapse of a month or two.\r\n\r\nThe projected scientific operations of the Expedition might easily have\r\nbeen carried out within eight days, had we not been so obstinately\r\npersecuted with unfavourable weather. Violent north winds, which rendered\r\nit impossible to make any use of the surveying-board in the open air,\r\nalternated in an extraordinary manner with rainbows. Our astronomical\r\nobservations were as yet nothing to speak of. Observations with the\r\nbarometer, thermometer, current-measurer, and tide-guage, could alone be\r\nprosecuted, the last of which especially gave the following interesting\r\nresult, that the hour of high water, both at full moon and new moon, is\r\nnot 11 A.M., as given by Horsburgh (7th edition, Vol. I. p. 102), but at\r\n1.10 P.M.[65]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: According to Lord Macartney, the tide rises at full and new\r\nmoon, between 8 and 9 feet perpendicular. A northerly wind always causes\r\nthe highest tide, the current of which is from S.E. by S. to N.W. by N.,\r\nand has a velocity of about 3 miles an hour.]\r\n\r\nThe proper carrying out of the objects of the geognostic enquiries was\r\nhampered by unforeseen obstacles and difficulties. One day the rain would\r\nbe so heavy, that the slight covering of our apartments would be\r\ninsufficient to protect us any longer from the beating of the rain which\r\nfell in bucketsfull, and began to leak through innumerable seams and\r\ncracks on to the beds, tables, and floor. Did any one think to shelter\r\nhimself in the hut of a neighbour?--ere long there commenced a regular\r\nemigration, which very speedily came to a conclusion, by each and all\r\nhaving the melancholy satisfaction of perceiving that Fortune had set to\r\nwork with rigorous impartiality, and had resolved to let each one of us\r\nfeel the weight of her displeasure. And so we passed the long dreary hours\r\nin our comfortless huts, that gave free entrance to wind and rain, with\r\numbrellas outspread or wrapped in our India-rubber cloaks, gazing moodily\r\nat the numerous cases full of valuable instruments, which, instead of\r\nbeing serviceable to science, were, by the loss of so many splendid\r\nopportunities, doomed to inactivity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAINY DAY AT ST. PAUL.]\r\n\r\nFortunately, all showed themselves animated by the utmost zeal for the\r\nundertaking and its successful issue; and, in a word, each fresh\r\navalanche of difficulties, which sought to thwart our exertions and impair\r\nour forces, served only to reawaken the energies and reanimate the\r\nconfidence of each and all amid all our calamities.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the hovel we inhabited, which had enabled us to make\r\nobservations upon the direction and strength of the wind rather than\r\nsecured us any accommodation for sleep, had been in some degree restored\r\nto its original condition, we availed ourselves of the slight improvement\r\nin the weather, to examine a tolerably numerous collection of very\r\nbeautifully bound books, which were found stowed away in one of the\r\nrecesses for books running into the four partitions, and had in all\r\nprobability much to dread from the rain-water trickling through the\r\ncovering of the roof. These had been brought hither by a former proprietor\r\nof the island, and when it was sold were transferred with the rest of the\r\nstock of tools, &c., to M. Ottovan, who occasionally resided at St. Paul\r\nfor a month or two, but seemed, so far as the condition of the books went,\r\nrarely to meddle with them. It was curious enough, however, to encounter\r\nin a lone desert island, so many evidences of the most refined\r\ncivilization, so we shall cite in a note some of the most interesting of\r\nthis library of about 150 different works, which deserved a better fate\r\nthan to moulder away undisturbed till they fell into dust.[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Among these were the works on Natural History, by Charles\r\nBonnel (Neufchâtel, 1783); J.

X, 2 vols.]\r\n\r\nLess fortunate were we in our researches for any document which could in\r\nany way throw any light, direct or indirect, upon the former history of\r\nSt. Paul. The only piece of writing which we found that had reference to\r\nthe island, was a licence drawn up during the reign of Louis Philippe,\r\ndated 20th February, 1846, to M. Adam, of St. Denis (in the Island of\r\nBourbon), to proceed to carry out a certain undertaking in the schooner\r\n\"_La Mouche_,\" 30 tons' burthen, under the protection of the French flag.\r\n\"_La Mouche_,\" is the same boat in which Viot had made so many voyages to\r\nand fro between St. Denis and St. Paul. This document, which the poor old\r\nFrenchman drew out one evening from a drawer thickly strewn with dust,\r\ninsensibly led the conversation to the quondam owners of St. Paul, and\r\nthence naturally to an enquiry, on our part, as to the number of graves\r\nwhich dotted this romantic offshoot of Père la Chaise. \"The climate is far\r\ntoo healthy, and the island far too little frequented, to admit of there\r\nbeing many graves in St. Paul,\" replied Viot. Of the blacks, whom M. Adam\r\nhad once worked so unmercifully on the island, very many perished here\r\nowing to the severity of their treatment, but no one knows where their\r\nbodies lie;--very possibly their bones lie scattered about the island,\r\nlike the remains of the much persecuted petrel (_prion turton_), which the\r\npredatory gull throws carelessly from him after he has stripped off the\r\nflesh, and gorged himself on the most delicate morsels. Only two graves\r\nare known to the present residents,--one is the resting-place of an\r\nEnglishwoman, who died on board a merchant-ship which happened to be near\r\nthe island, and whose grave was dug in the earth on the north side of the\r\ncrater-basin; the second covers the body of a ship captain, who was\r\naccidentally drowned in the basin by the upsetting of a small boat, as he\r\nwas approaching the bar in heavy weather. His grave is at a short distance\r\nbehind the huts of the colonists, and bears traces to this day of the\r\nsolemn feelings with which it was erected; an enclosure of large stones\r\nneatly arranged, make the site and its object at once recognisable.\r\n\r\nShipwrecks are unheard of at St. Paul; at least, none such have been known\r\nto occur since it has been occupied by man. On the other hand, they are of\r\nmore frequent occurrence at the sister island, as has very lately been\r\nevidenced by the catastrophe of the _Meridian_. However, the elements are\r\nnot always to blame for such lamentable occurrences. Ships are sometimes\r\ndashed to pieces on the shores of Amsterdam in the finest weather, so that\r\none is almost induced to believe that these misfortunes are occasionally\r\nresorted to intentionally, so as to realize some high insurance on a\r\nvessel which has probably already become half unseaworthy--a not very\r\nconscientious method of doing business, of which, however, some of the\r\nnatives of Greece and the borders thereof are not unfrequently guilty. In\r\nFebruary, 1855, a North American whaler struck upon the north-east side of\r\nAmsterdam in a calm, and with a clear sky overhead, so that the entire\r\ncrew, 30 in number, were able to secure the provisions and their kits. The\r\ncaptain, with one of the ship's small boats, made for the Island of St.\r\nPaul, 42 miles distant, in the hope, probably, of getting assistance\r\nthence. A lucky destiny so willed it, that (the accident having occurred\r\nin the finest season of the year), a vessel of M. Ottovan's, which by a\r\nstrange coincidence was named _L'Ange Gardien_ (the Guardian Angel), lay\r\nat anchor inside the crater-basin, loading with fish. The shipwrecked crew\r\nwere indebted to his circumstance that, within 14 days more, they found\r\nthemselves at Mauritius. A report circulated among the residents of St.\r\nPaul that the captain of the stranded ship had landed with some of his\r\ncompanions in a boat on the N.E. of Amsterdam, with the intention of\r\nsearching for a sum of several thousand dollars which a previous visitant\r\nto this island was said to have buried there for some mysterious reasons.\r\nWhile the captain was on shore, vainly searching for a considerable time\r\nafter the buried treasure, the shipmaster left in charge in his absence\r\ncame too near the island, whereupon the vessel had been lost upon one of\r\nthe numerous reefs which lie off the shore. A part, it was added, of the\r\nburied money had, in fact, been recovered. According to Viot, the captain\r\nhad dug up 1000 dollars (above £200), and one of his companions 300\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the morning of 3rd December--the fifteenth of our stay at the\r\nisland--the sky shone so brightly that one could, with more probability\r\nthan hitherto, cherish the hope that the various operations we had been\r\ncompelled to lay aside might finally be brought uninterrupted to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. However, the very wet day was again exceedingly\r\nunfavourable for open-air observations, especially astronomical, inasmuch\r\nas a pretty strong North-east wind incessantly drove over the island\r\nclouds of rain, the very heaviest of which, attracted by the mass of the\r\nisland, broke right over our heads. Fortunately this spell of bad weather\r\ndid not last as long as the first; and when, on 6th December, the _Novara_\r\nonce more made her appearance at the island, and enquired by signals as to\r\nthe progress made in our appointed work, we were so fortunate as to be\r\nable to reply by the same means, that the most important portion had been\r\ncompleted, and that the officers and naturalists were ready to re-embark.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 A.M., the frigate anchored in 25 fathoms, close to the spot where\r\nthe English ship _Fly_, Captain Blackwood, lay in 1842. It was the third\r\ntime that the _Novara_ anchored off St. Paul. Twice before had she\r\nexperienced unusually tempestuous weather, which compelled her to sheer\r\noff from such a perilous coast, and expose herself to be lashed for days\r\ntogether by the raging giant waves of the infuriated element.\r\n\r\nOne of the boats sent by the frigate to take us off to the ship, brought\r\nat the same time some presents, in memory of the Expedition, for the\r\nresidents of the island, who had been so hospitable and obliging during\r\nour stay. The presents consisted of ship biscuit, salted meat, and various\r\nother edibles, wine, a musket, woollen blankets, clothes, shoes, tools,\r\nmedicines, vinegar, oil, &c. The simple, modest fellows were immensely\r\npleased with these unexpected presents, and Viot especially seemed\r\noverjoyed on seeing a number of tools, for want of which many of the\r\nrepairs necessary in the interior of their anything but air-tight wooden\r\nhabitations, were daily becoming more apparent.\r\n\r\nWe left a book on the Island of St. Paul, in which the principal memoranda\r\nof what we had achieved were set forth in three languages (German,\r\nEnglish, and French), with the view of supplying to future scientific\r\nvisitors, data for further researches and observations, and at same time\r\nincite them to prosecute these we had ourselves made.\r\n\r\nWe insert here this document, which will yet give witness, probably, of\r\nthe scientific activity of the Austrian Expedition at the Island of St.\r\nPaul in the Indian Ocean, at a period when those engaged in it will long\r\nsince have voyaged to\r\n\r\n    \"That undiscovered country from whose bourne\r\n    No traveller returns.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Imperial Austrian Frigate, _Novara_, 44, under the command of\r\nCommodore the Chevalier von Wüllerstorf-Urbair, engaged in a voyage round\r\nthe globe for scientific purposes, anchored at nine in the morning of\r\n19th November, 1857, on the Eastern side of St. Paul, with the purpose of\r\nprosecuting astronomical, magnetic, meteorological, and geodesical\r\nobservations and measurements, and at same time examine thoroughly the\r\nnatural history of the island. Extremely unfavourable weather in great\r\nmeasure delayed the expedition; and, after having successfully carried out\r\na series of observations and researches, the results of which will in due\r\ntime be published, the officers and naturalists in charge of the various\r\ndepartments, on the 6th December of the same year, quitted St. Paul, each\r\nbearing with him the most pleasing reminiscences of that interesting\r\nisland, and of its three poor, but eminently kind inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"For the guidance of future observers the following memoranda may prove\r\nuseful:--\r\n\r\n\"I. That the spot at which observations were taken was on a small\r\neminence, north of the huts of the colonists, and which may be recognized\r\nby a small pyramid of stones, on which the Austrian Expedition marked the\r\nobserved latitude 38° 42' 55'' S., and the longitude 77° 31' 18'' E. of\r\nGreenwich.[67] Further that:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: The time, which we took from the Cape Observatory by four\r\nexcellent chronometers, gave, on our voyage between the Cape and St. Paul,\r\na period of forty-six days, a difference of 3 h. 56 min. 11 sec., which\r\nthe island was E. of the Cape, so that adding the Longitude of the latter\r\nEast of Greenwich (by nautical almanack), 1 h. 13 min. 55 s., we have the\r\nLongitude of St. Paul 5 h. 10 min. 6 s. East of Greenwich (77° 31' 30''\r\nE.) Between Madras and St. Paul, during a long passage of sixty-seven\r\ndays, and with six chronometers somewhat less accurately set than the\r\npreceding, St. Paul was found by observation to be 0 h. 10 min. 51.8 sec.\r\nWest of Madras (2° 42' 55'' W.) By the longitude of the Observatory of\r\nMadras, 5 h. 20 min. 57 sec. East of Greenwich (80° 14' 15'' E.), as\r\nfurnished by the Director of the Observatory, Major Jacobs (whereas the\r\nnautical almanack gave 5 h. 21 m. 3.77 sec. = 80° 16' 0-1/2''). The\r\nlongitude of St. Paul would be 5 h. 10 m. 5.2 s. East of Greenwich (77°\r\n31' 23'' E.) The average of the two measurements gives as the average 5 h.\r\n10 m. 5.6 sec., or 77° 31' 26'' E. to be assumed as the final longitude of\r\nSt. Paul, while the latitude was taken from the various means of the\r\nheight of the sun at the meridian on an average of days. An additional\r\ncomputation in which allowances were made for the various corrections,\r\ngave, as the latitude, 38° 42' 47'' S.]\r\n\r\n\"II. That the direction of the true meridian line drawn from this point to\r\nthe nearest opposite shore of the South side of the crater-basin was\r\nmarked by an oblique (St. Andrew's) cross.\r\n\r\n\"III. That the tidal-gauge was situated on a rock near the landing-place,\r\nand that the rise of the tide above the mean level of the water (3 feet 5\r\ninches), was marked on a slab of rock smoothed for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\"IV. Lastly. The magnetic observations were taken in a hut erected for\r\nthat express purpose on the little plateau behind the settlers' huts,\r\nwhere at the same time various sorts of useful trees were planted by the\r\nExpedition.\r\n\r\n\"The names of the officers and naturalists who, under the superintendence\r\nof the commander of the Imperial Expedition, took part in the various\r\nscientific operations were:--for Astronomy and Terrestrial Magnetism,\r\nLieutenant Robert Müllar; Botany, Dr. Edward Schwarz and M. Jellinck;\r\nGeodesy and Meteorology, Lieutenant Eugen Kronowetter; for the\r\nTrigonometrical Measurement of the Crater-basin, Lieutenant Gustavus\r\nBattlogg; for Geology, Dr. Ferdinand Hochstetter; Ethnology and Physical\r\nGeography, Dr. Karl Scherzer; Zoology, G. Frauenfeld and J. Zelebor;\r\nDraughtsman and Artist, Joseph Sellemy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.--TRACK FROM ST. PAUL TO POINT DE GALLE. (CEYLON).]\r\n\r\nTowards 5 P.M. the last boat came off with the measuring and levelling\r\ninstruments, and various articles of baggage.[68] The embarkation was\r\nfinally completed. Half-an-hour later the _Novara_ weighed anchor, and we\r\nsteered, favoured with most splendid weather and full of pleasing\r\nanticipations, for the adjacent island of New Amsterdam. Not without\r\nsundry twitches of sadness did we remark the sharp crater of St. Paul\r\ngradually fade away like a vision in the gloom of approaching night; and\r\nmany undying memories must attach to our residence on that lonely,\r\nworld-forsaken island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Remembering how many bottles and glass tubes were shattered,\r\nwe have not thought it beyond our province to recommend future scientific\r\ntravellers to bring with them a good supply of duplicates of all\r\ninstruments liable to breakage, as it is very difficult to get such\r\ninsignificant articles replaced out of Europe, and we frequently found on\r\nthis occasion the want of some such little instrument interposed an\r\nobstacle to the further usefulness of the instruments.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, at the moment of our departure from the island, be it permitted\r\nus to cast a retrospective glance at the various results obtained by the\r\nExpedition of the _Novara_ during her stay at St. Paul.\r\n\r\nNever hitherto on this island, so important by its geographical position\r\nfor ships trading with China, the East Indies, Australia, and New Zealand,\r\nhave astronomical and magnetic observations and geodesical measurements\r\nbeen so thoroughly ascertained as by the _Novara_ expedition. Upon a\r\ncarefully measured base-line, various points of the upper and lower\r\nmargin of the crater were accurately laid down by means of the Theodolite,\r\nand the whole island submitted to a geometric network of angles. At the\r\nsame time the geologist, with the aid of the compass and the patent\r\nlevels, prepared a chart originally intended for geological purposes only,\r\nwhile the draughtsman of the expedition added to its value, by skilfully\r\nsketching in from these given points the configuration of the coast-line\r\nof the island. By their united efforts there has been published a chart of\r\nSt. Paul, which gives even to the minutest details an entirely correct and\r\naccurate representation of the form and surface of the island. This minute\r\nchart, or plan, was prepared on a scale of 132 Vienna fathoms to one\r\nVienna inch, or 1/9504 of the natural size. Moreover, it is intended\r\npreparing, from this map and from the various outlines and views taken on\r\nthe spot, a plastic model of the island after Nature, which, moulded in\r\ngypsum, will give scientific inquirers the most accurate conception of its\r\nsingular structure. Not less interesting for navigators in the Indian\r\nOcean will be the publication of the various observations which, during\r\nour stay of 18 days, were made with the barometer, thermometer,\r\ntide-gauge, and gauge of the velocity of currents, taken at certain fixed\r\nhours, day and night, as also the soundings in the crater-basin, and on\r\nboth sides of the bar. Although the complete publication of these _data_\r\nmust await the appearance of the nautical portion of the present work, we\r\nshall give here the most important of these results. The extreme length of\r\nthe island from N.W. to S.E., is three nautical miles; the superficial\r\narea is 1,600,000 Vienna square klafter--1 Vienna klafter = 1 fathom = 6\r\nEnglish feet--100 English square feet = 92-986/1000 Vienna square feet.\r\nThe highest point of the crater-basin is 846 feet; the greatest diameter\r\nof the upper rim of the crater is 5490 feet; the least 4590 feet; the\r\ngreatest diameter of the basin at the level of the sea is 3984 feet, and\r\nthe least 3444 Vienna feet.\r\n\r\nThe observations on the state of the weather, taken with much difficulty,\r\nare not intended to include the regular observations on the exterior of\r\nthe island, and in like manner some of those taken in the harbour, or\r\nbasin of the crater, must be accepted with a certain limitation. For\r\nsimilar reasons, we were unable to fix the rate of the current setting\r\nfrom the sea into the basin, although we secured most extraordinary\r\nresults considering the circumstances. The amount of specimens of natural\r\nhistory which was procured, was very limited, but on that account was the\r\nmore valuable. To the geologist, it must be of the very highest interest\r\nto find that St. Paul has been classified, with scientific precision, and\r\nby dint of personal examination and research, in one of the four main\r\ndivisions in which, according to the scheme of Alexander Von Humboldt, the\r\nvolcanic formations of the earth may be divided. Measured by the latest\r\ndistribution of the volcanic strata by the description of stone found, as\r\nlaid down by the greatest of German naturalists, St. Paul belongs to the\r\nsame class as Chimborazo, Popocatepetl, Teneriffe, &c., in a word, to\r\nwhat is known as the Chimborazo formation. A section of the east-side,\r\ntaken in profile, lays bare its entire geological history, and forms one\r\nof the most instructive means of coming to direct conclusions as to its\r\ngeological structure.\r\n\r\nThe birth of this island from the bosom of the deep, combined with\r\neruptions of lava and scoriæ, was the last effort of the subterranean\r\nforces. Since that period it has been subject wholly and solely to the\r\nvarious terrestrial influences, although the lapse of centuries has not\r\nbeen able to extirpate the last traces of the volcanic fire which once\r\npoured forth its currents of molten lava. A large proportion of the level\r\nground is hot, and at the lower edge of the rim of the crater appear\r\nseveral hot springs, the temperature of which, as already remarked, is so\r\nhigh that fish, eggs, potatoes, &c., can be cooked on them in a few\r\nminutes. The highest point of St. Paul rises 870 feet above the basin of\r\nthe crater. Its walls rise abruptly at an angle of about 85°, while the\r\nupper surface of the island (with the single exception of a small plateau\r\nof about 400 feet on the north side) stretches, at first level from the\r\nperiphery of the upper margin of the crater, gradually falling away\r\ntowards the sea-coast, at an angle of about 13°. On its North-west coast,\r\nwhere it is from 100 to 200 feet in perpendicular height, the island\r\npresents several small pyramids of pumice, like parasitic warts on the\r\nprincipal mass.\r\n\r\nLike the geologist, the botanist also found in this wild spot an unusual\r\nopportunity of acquiring accurate information as to the occurrence and\r\npropagation of certain kinds of plants in a primitive soil. Six grasses\r\nand one reed (_cyperaceæ_) form the vegetation of the island, one rush and\r\nthree or four of the grasses forming the majority. The botanist having\r\nascended to the plateau found there two grasses, both of which grew to a\r\ncertain height only, and at certain places; the one (in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the settler's huts,) the oat, or _avena_; the second a\r\n_digitaria_, in the neighbourhood of the terraced fields, directly\r\nopposite the entrance to the crater, in warm positions, which, so soon as\r\nthe earth is a little disturbed, emit jets of steam. It is still uncertain\r\nwhether the other kinds of grass, _Poa_ and _Setaria Holcus_, belong\r\nexclusively to St. Paul, or are to be included in the more general group\r\nof geographical plants known as that of the islands of Edward's Island,\r\nKerguelen's Island, and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nAmong the grasses there spring up here and there, but on the whole very\r\nsparsely, some wild vegetables which have been planted by previous chance\r\nvisitors.[69] In the crater there are also _Sonchus arvensis_ and one\r\n_Plantago_ (Plantain). On the south margin of the crater are _Cerastium_\r\n(maize-ear chickweed), and _Stellaria media_ (chickweed); both grow on a\r\nsmall piece of ground, and are far from thriving. Of _Cryptogamia_ the\r\nbotanist found four sorts. Two _Parmelias_, one _Evernia_, and one\r\n_Cladonia_, the first-named overrunning the blocks on the edge of the\r\ncrater with great luxuriance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Such as _Rumex acetosella_, _Cynara Scolcymus_ (artichoke);\r\n_Solanum tuberosum_ (species of nightshade); _Daucus carotta_ (carrot);\r\n_Petroselinum sativum_ (parsley); _Brassica oleracea_ (sea-kail);\r\n_Raphanus sativus_ (horse-radish).]\r\n\r\nOf _Algæ_ there were found 33 species. The stones rolled backwards and\r\nforwards by the action of the waves, as also those surfaces which remained\r\ncovered at lowest tide, were entirely covered with _Dicurella flabellata_.\r\nMost numerous was _Gigartina radula_, just in a state of fructification.\r\nEvery movement of the water calls up slender, delicate _confervæ_, and\r\npale and coloured _luminariæ_. The breakers have crowned the stones with\r\nfestoons of the _Macrocystis pyrifera_. Of Liverworts there were found\r\n_Marchantia_ and _Jungermania_; of foliaceous mosses, _Sphagnum_\r\n(bog-moss), and two kinds of _Bruym_. Two ferns, just beginning to bear\r\nfruit, were found on the plateau, and one _Lycopodium_ (club-moss), which\r\nthrives pretty well, and frequently grows on the _Sphagnum_. On the whole,\r\nthe botanist of the expedition found on the island, 11 _Phanerogamia_, 4\r\n_Lichens_, 33 _Algæ_, 2 ferns, 2 Liverworts, 3 foliaceous mosses, 1\r\n_Lycopodium_. In this enumeration are included the European vegetables\r\ncultivated by the residents, as also some untended plants, which\r\napparently have been introduced with the vegetables, or have been brought\r\nhither by previous visitors. The stony substratum of this island is barely\r\ncovered with a plastic vegetable substance, which fills the cracks. The\r\nwalls of the crater, as also the entire plateau, present to view a plain,\r\nunrelieved expanse of grass; not, however, like fields clothed with sward,\r\nbut single tufts pressing one upon the other, which seem like the\r\ngrave-mounds of a hundred bygone generations of plants. Frequently, at the\r\nfoot of a block of pumice, all overrun with grasses of all sorts, one\r\ncomes upon a moss or a stem of fern on one of the pieces of lava that has\r\nbeen washed up, or perceives with amazement in some out-of-the-way place,\r\nand utterly neglected, good old acquaintances from Europe, such as\r\ncarrots, parsley, potatoes, &c., which apparently have been begun to be\r\ncultivated on some of the terraces, whence they have propagated themselves\r\nin a wild state all over the island. But not a tree, or bush, is to be met\r\nwith throughout the island.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, although the zoologist seemed to have but a poor prospect\r\nat St. Paul, it presented materials for most satisfactory speculation to\r\nthe attentive naturalist. Only one of the grasses is infested by an\r\ninsect, which appears in great numbers, a very tiny _cicada_ (cricket),\r\nthe _Delphis hemiptera_, of which, according to the zoologist of the\r\nexpedition, it is hard to say whether it became indigenous to St. Paul\r\nbefore, or contemporaneous with the arrival of man. Among other insects\r\nthat have certainly been introduced here, the zoologist found the common\r\nbluebottle-fly, a gnat, the universally found cockroach, the book-tick\r\n(_acarus eruditus_), one kind of earwig, and the flea; besides the\r\n_Isopodis_, our common barrel-worm,[70] in almost fabulous quantities.\r\nThese animals invariably follow man wherever he plants his foot, living\r\nupon garbage or decaying organic matter. With the exception of the\r\nclothes-moth, which has probably been introduced among the wool-stuffs,\r\nthere are in the island no butterflies, none of the been tribe, no\r\n_Neuroptera_. Mites also need scarcely be reckoned, since the only\r\nrepresentative, the common cheese-mite, is more apt to become extinct than\r\nto thrive; on the other hand, there are two kinds of spiders, for which\r\nthe enormous number of flies furnish sufficient food.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: These loathsome animals cover the island in such quantities\r\nthat one of the naturalists reckoned them at 6,000,000,000, counting 100\r\nas the minimum to each square foot of the island.]\r\n\r\nThe species belonging to the sea are somewhat more plentifully\r\nrepresented, although, with few exceptions, very small and insignificant.\r\nThe largest shell fish, a _Tritonium_, only attains a length of 3 inches;\r\n_Patella_, which is very plentiful all round the island, is only 1 inch\r\nlong; several sorts of snails (such as _Buccinum_, _Defrancia_,\r\n_Mangelia_, _Paludinella_, _Adeorbis_, _Janthina_, _Fissurella_,\r\n_Scutellina_, _Lepidopleurus_, _Bulla_, _Asteronotus_, _Doto_), are barely\r\na few lines in length, or even less.\r\n\r\nThe _Brachiopoda_ are represented by a very inferior member, the\r\n_Terebratulina_, only two lines long, which, however, is a giant compared\r\nwith one of the two only kinds of mussel, _Kellia_ and _Lima_, which are\r\noccasionally met with here, and are only half-a-line in length.\r\n\r\nAmong the _Vertebratæ_, the fishery of which is the principal object of\r\nthe visits annually paid to the island, one, the _Cheilodactylus_, a\r\nspinous-finned fish, which is extraordinarily abundant all round the\r\nisland, supports an important fishery, while _Thyrsites Atun_ were\r\nfrequently caught with rod and line from the frigate.\r\n\r\nOf _Amphibiæ_, there is not a vestige to be found on the island; the birds\r\nbelong for the most part to the powerful-winged web-footed birds that\r\nfrequent the open ocean, as, for example, the _Diomedea exulans_ (great\r\nalbatross or man-of-war bird), _D. chlororhynchus_ (yellow-billed\r\nalbatross), _D. fuliginosa_ (a new one not determined), _Lestris\r\ncatarractes_, _Storna sp: Prion Vittatus_, of which the four last-named,\r\nat the time of our visit, had both eggs and young. Of birds with\r\nfin-shaped wings, there was the golden-crested penguin (_Apterodytes\r\nchrysocoma S._), living in two distinct colonies among the precipitous\r\noverhanging cliffs, with innumerable young, already of a pretty good\r\nsize.[71] We also remarked several other winged denizens of the deep, which\r\nhad alighted on our ship during the last few days immediately preceding\r\nour arrival at St. Paul. According to the fishery-people, the other birds\r\nof the island quit it altogether so soon as their young have grown\r\nsufficiently, and only return when the next breeding season comes round.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: One of the zoologists, Mr. Zelebor, endeavoured to kill two\r\npenguins that had been caught alive in the island, the one with arsenic,\r\nthe other with chloroform. Of the latter, a quantity was administered\r\nenough to have killed a man, but which scarcely affected the penguin, who,\r\nin a quarter of an hour after, seemed quite restored to himself. The\r\nsecond, which had swallowed two tea-spoonsful of arsenic, died eight hours\r\nlater.]\r\n\r\nIn contradistinction to the sea-birds, M. Frauenfeld remarked but one\r\nsingle land-bird, a swallow, whose movements seemed to indicate that he\r\nwas watching a breeding female. A stray bird on this lonely spot of earth,\r\nnearly 3000 miles away from the main land! Hundreds of questions\r\nsuggested themselves on thus unexpectedly coming upon so well-known a\r\nwanderer. What could have condemned him to this self-imposed exile? Was he\r\na straggler? Was it the first time he had selected this island for a home?\r\nHad it been his own cradle? And would he at some future period find\r\ncompanions to visit with him, and ultimately share these solitary desolate\r\nabodes?\r\n\r\nThere were no seals visible,--they have retreated before the attacks and\r\nstratagems of their insatiate pursuer the seal-hunter, and for a long\r\nperiod have ceased to frequent the island. Indeed, St. Paul furnishes not\r\na single specimen of mammal peculiar to itself; for all the members of\r\nthis great natural division at present on it,--such as goats, swine, cats,\r\n&c.,--having become wild, must necessarily be classed, however unusual,\r\nwith rats, mice, and the like. In other respects, all these have not\r\nvaried in the slightest from the type of the domesticated animal (although\r\nthey have probably lived wild for a hundred years past), except that they\r\nare very shy and avoid the presence of man.\r\n\r\nWhile upon these various points, the stay of the Imperial Expedition at\r\nSt. Paul gave many splendid results by means of observations and\r\nscientific collections, it was also productive of a number of important\r\npractical benefits for seafaring people. The geodesical results, for\r\ninstance, obtained by the Expedition, demonstrate that there is formed by\r\nthe basin of the crater at St. Paul's, despite the small extent of its\r\ncoast-line, a secure natural haven which would afford substantial\r\nfacilities for ships, to which, on their voyage to China, Australia, or\r\nanywhere in the East Indies, any accident has happened, necessitating\r\ncomplete and speedy repair, or which might require fresh provisions for\r\ntheir crews, stricken with scurvy after a long voyage. For, although the\r\ndepth of the basin of the crater in the centre is very considerable, and\r\nalthough the squalls of wind from the N.W. are often very violent, the\r\nship can always make fast to the land, and so ensure the requisite\r\nsecurity. How far the assistance so cheerfully rendered by science may\r\nhave been called for, or how far the route at present traversed by sailing\r\nvessels makes that assistance desirable, must be left to the judgment of\r\nthose nations, such as the English, French, and Dutch, which, as having\r\npossessions washed by the Indian Ocean, have a direct interest in the\r\nfuture condition of such a harbour of refuge, situate equidistant from\r\nAsia, Africa, and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe morning after our departure from St. Paul, that is to say, on 7th\r\nDec., we found ourselves not more than ten miles distant from Amsterdam.\r\nThe first view of the island greatly resembles that of St. Paul, and the\r\nhypothesis gained constantly in probability that the geological formation\r\nof Amsterdam is nearly identical with that of St. Paul.\r\n\r\nA whaler was cruising in the neighbourhood of the island, while one of his\r\nslim whaleboats was pursuing a school of sperm whales, which sported about\r\nin great numbers.\r\n\r\nTowards 7 A.M., a boat approached from the whaler _Esmeralda_, Captain\r\nPierce, of New Bedford, Massachusetts, to ask for surgical assistance for\r\na sailor who, while engaged a few days previously in hauling a captured\r\nfish alongside, had had his left hand so severely injured by one of the\r\nlines, that amputation had seemed the sole remedy. The Captain had, in\r\ngenuine Yankee fashion, assumed the duties of surgeon, and performed the\r\noperation himself. Now that it was over, and when neither praise nor\r\ncensure could benefit the patient, he was anxious to know whether he had\r\ndone right or wrong. While one of the ship's surgeons was getting ready,\r\nas requested by the captain, to proceed to the bedside of his patient, the\r\nwhaler informed us he had already been absent from his family in the\r\nStates five months, and would proceed hence to the Sandwich Islands and\r\nthe Northern grounds, and finally return home round Cape Horn. If the take\r\nof fish proved good, he hoped to complete the voyage within two years.\r\nWhale-fishing, in truth, is not only a very dangerous and laborious, but\r\nalso a most precarious pursuit. Occasionally a ship gets loaded within a\r\nbrief space with oil and whalebone, by which, of course, the owner or\r\ncharterer makes a splendid profit, and the entire crew obtain a handsome\r\nshare. But frequently does it happen that, after a voyage of fifteen\r\nmonths and more, there is not a single fish taken, in which case the hardy\r\nsailors, who are entirely dependent for their pay upon a share of the\r\nspoil, have had all their labour and undergone all their privations in\r\nvain, while the freighter is poorer by a good round sum. The bare chance,\r\nhowever, of a rich haul is sufficient to raise to 8000, the number\r\n(probably on the increase) of the ships of varying tonnage and\r\nnationality, which at present encounter the anxieties, dangers, and\r\nhardships attaching to the whale-fishery. It is calculated that, were it\r\npossible to anchor them within signalling distance of each other, they\r\nwould form a complete girdle round the earth at the Equator. In other\r\nrespects, the incessant activity of the whaler is not without its\r\nadvantages for science, since the observations and communications of many\r\nof the captains connected with the whaling business have essentially\r\ncontributed to extend our acquaintance with atmospheric phenomena,\r\nespecially in high latitudes, on both sides of the Equator.\r\n\r\nThe loquacious captain, an uncommon quality in a Yankee, could not conceal\r\nhis astonishment at encountering an Austrian man-of-war in such a latitude\r\nin mid-ocean, and adverted to this unexpected phenomenon. Captain Pierce\r\nfurther complained bitterly of the weather, and said that, as long as he\r\nhad sailed the Indian Ocean, he had never at this season experienced such\r\ntempestuous weather as during the last week; which was further confirmed\r\nby several other whalers, regular visitors to these waters. Respecting\r\nAmsterdam, Captain Pierce, unfortunately, could give us but very little\r\ninformation. He had never set foot on the island, nor did he know whether\r\nit was accessible at all. But he spoke highly of the availability of the\r\ncoasts for valuable fish. Nowhere in the Indian Ocean, the Captain\r\nremarked, was there such an abundance of fish of all descriptions as at\r\nthe Southernmost point of this little-known island. Consequently most\r\nwhalers, on their course Southwards, approach this island, and send out\r\nboats to bring in supplies of fish suitable for the table. Usually the\r\nboat is filled in a few hours with delicious food caught with the rod and\r\nline, when the fish are forthwith salted, in sufficient quantities to\r\nsupply the crew for several weeks.\r\n\r\nIs Amsterdam really a sister-island of St. Paul? Is it, too, of volcanic\r\norigin, upheaved by the same subterranean energy, and does it still show\r\nsimilar traces of long-continued activity? These questions pressed on us\r\nfor solution all the more vividly as we neared this inaccessible island,\r\nwhen we recalled to mind the mysterious phenomena which D'Entrecasteaux\r\nhad observed here in March, 1792, and which have remained unexplained to\r\nthis day.[72] The French Expedition saw, it is true, clouds of smoke\r\nemerging alternately from a subterranean opening close to the shore, but\r\nwithout being able to satisfy themselves whether the vegetation had been\r\nset on fire by the hand of man or by volcanic action, the wind which blew\r\ndirect from the island making it impossible to land, unless one was\r\nprepared to run the risk of being suffocated by the rolling masses of\r\nsmoke. There was, therefore, to be solved, at Amsterdam, the mystery as to\r\nwhether the pillars of smoke, which were observed by the naturalists of\r\nthe French Expedition of 1792, issuing from the soil adjoining the sea,\r\nwere produced by an actual eruption, or were caused by subterranean fires\r\nin activity.[73]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: La Billardière, Rélation du voyage à la recherche de la\r\nPeyrouse, fait par ordre de l'Assemblée Constituante pendant les années\r\n1791-94, Paris, 1800. (Vol. I., pp. 112, 113.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Vide Alexander v. Humboldt's \"Kosmos,\" Vol. IV., pp. 412 and\r\n585; also Physical and Geognostic Remarks, by the same author, prefixed to\r\nthis volume.]\r\n\r\nAbout 11 A.M., the two jolly-boats of the _Novara_ were lowered to look\r\nfor a landing-place on Amsterdam, while the frigate stood off and on,\r\nunder easy sail, at an offing of five or six miles. Our whaling informant\r\nhad told us the most abundant fishing-station was at the south point of\r\nthe island, while the best place for disembarking was on the N.W. shore.\r\nAs, however, upon consideration, it was deemed advisable, looking to the\r\nprobability of a N.E. gale springing up, to get to windward of the ship,\r\nso as to be able to fetch her more speedily on our return, the S.E. side\r\nwas selected, and our course laid for it accordingly. Along the\r\nacclivities of the coast pyramids of loose stones were visible, resembling\r\nthose on St. Paul, but more numerous and of larger dimensions, the entire\r\nisland seeming altogether on a much larger scale, and more lofty. On the\r\nWest side we observed rocky precipices of from 1000 to 2000 feet in\r\nheight, fissured with deep clefts and rents, whereas on the South and\r\nS.E., these presented a more gradual slope.\r\n\r\nFor above an hour we steered along the shore, which rose sheer out of the\r\nwater, without being able to detect a single point at which it was at all\r\npracticable to disembark, so as to scramble up to the high ground. The\r\nentire Eastern side is hemmed around with steep abrupt precipices of 150\r\nto 200 feet high, not unlike skilfully-erected bastions, and clothed with\r\nlong thick grass.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near, we could plainly discern in the water-courses that\r\ndescend upon the upper slope--radiating, as it were, from all sides of the\r\nhighest peak, which was enveloped in clouds--numerous streams of water,\r\neach pouring through a rift like a thread of silver, after which,\r\nprecipitating itself over the steep precipices on the shore, it washed\r\nlike a small torrent over terraces and banks of lava, till it was lost in\r\nthe sea. If these streams are swollen by the heavy rain in winter, they\r\nmay form waterfalls, as mentioned by early navigators, which must impart a\r\nfar less pleasing character to the landscape. Two small patches of\r\ndazzling white, like fresh fallen snow, which were visible high above the\r\nslope, we could not make out with the utmost power of our glasses. The\r\ngreen colour which enveloped the entire island seemed to indicate the\r\nexistence of grass vegetation resembling that of St. Paul.\r\n\r\nAt last, when we had got within two cables' length of the shore, we\r\nencountered enormous green flakes of floating sea-weed, which, becoming\r\nentangled with the rudder, made further progress possible only by dint of\r\nmost strenuous exertions. This proved to be the same gigantic sea-tangle\r\nof the Southern hemispheres (_Macrocystis Pyrifera_), which likewise\r\nconstitutes a barrier of _fucus_ on the East side of St. Paul. The\r\nsea-calves mentioned by older describers were nowhere to be seen; but on\r\nthe other hand we had an opportunity of satisfying ourselves as to the\r\nimmense abundance of fish which frequent the coast of the island in a\r\ntruly astonishing degree, although the American whaler had prepared us by\r\nhis remarks. From bow and stern of the boat hooks and lines were hung out,\r\nand several of the crew were at once kept busy hauling in the lines, at\r\nthe end of each of which there usually struggled a fish of some two or\r\nthree feet long. These were chiefly umber fish, which are also very\r\nplentiful about St. Paul, where, from their delicacy, they formed a\r\nfavourite dish at our otherwise very frugal repasts.\r\n\r\nWe had now got so near, that we could distinctly perceive grass and the\r\nstems of ferns growing among the clefts of the rocks. However, although\r\nthere was a dead calm, and the sea outside was as smooth as glass, the\r\nlong ground-swell of the ocean, with its broad flat billows, caused such a\r\nheavy surf on the rock-bound stony beach, that the attempt to pass it was\r\nnot to be thought of. The further we advanced along the coast in a\r\nnorthernly direction, the more distant we got from the ship, and unluckily\r\nin an equal degree our hopes were disappointed of finding a spot at which\r\nwe could land, and scramble from the strand up the steep bank to the level\r\nground above. The south-easternmost point, which at a distance presented\r\nthe appearance of a low headland jutting out into the sea, behind which we\r\nhad hoped to find a good landing-place, now that we had got close to it,\r\nproved to be a small detached rock; while the shore, as far as the eye\r\ncould reach, rose like a wall to a height of from 150 to 200 feet. There\r\nnow hove in sight five whalers, who seemed hunting that most valuable of\r\nall the inhabitants of the deep, of the spots frequented by which Maury's\r\nrenowned Whale Charts have lately supplied so interesting and useful a\r\ncode of instruction. These charts, which are based on a vast number of\r\nobservations, of the tracts of ocean and seasons of the year at which\r\nwhales are most frequently seen, will at the same time greatly tend to a\r\nsolution of the question as to the migration of these enormous mammals;\r\nfor it has never yet been settled, whether these animals flee from the\r\npursuit of man to remote seas, thus continually constraining their\r\npursuers to seek their prey in new waters, or whether, (as is the most\r\nprevalent opinion), they are always entirely extirpated from one locality,\r\nand accordingly are only to be met with in any numbers in some different\r\narea, in which man has as yet only rarely, if ever, disturbed them.[74]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Some very valuable and detailed particulars of the Whale\r\nfishery are to be found in Maury's incomparable work, \"The Physical\r\nGeography of the Ocean,\" and in Dr. Hartwigs' \"Popular Treatise on\r\nAnimated Nature in the Ocean. (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1855.)\"]\r\n\r\nAfter an hour-and-a-half of continuous rowing, and when, in our very\r\nunsuitable boat, we had got about 7 nautical miles distant from the\r\nfrigate, we at last found a smooth spot between two reefs, which projected\r\nabove the level of the sea like a breakwater, and at once let go the\r\nboat's anchor. A regular landing-place, however, was not to be hoped for\r\nat this point. It was necessary first to make a spring to a block of rock,\r\nand thence, picking one's way among stones rendered slippery by being\r\ncovered at flood-tide, endeavour to reach the beach. This we all\r\nsucceeded in accomplishing over the rough rocks, without any mischance,\r\nand at last we stood on the firm soil of the Island of Amsterdam, at a\r\nspot which assuredly had never before been trodden by human feet, unless\r\nby some castaway. For only in consequence of the sea being perfectly calm,\r\nwhich at this season was quite unusual, were we able to reach the shore at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nWhat a scene of wildest desolation, and inaccessible solitude now met our\r\ngaze! Around us nothing but huge blocks of basalt, some rolled about by\r\nthe breakers, and so slippery with half-dry _algæ_, that one was in danger\r\nof falling at every stride; others with their angles and indentations as\r\nsharp, as when first violently torn from their original bed; and behind\r\nthese gigantic blocks, a perpendicular wall of rock rising 200 feet sheer,\r\ncomposed of a schistus of basaltic lava lying regularly and horizontally\r\none over the other, intermixed with red or brown slag, and yellow tufa.\r\nImmense holes and cavities in the rocky wall, as also the empty spaces\r\nbetween the broken blocks that had fallen down, and the vast air-holes\r\nscooped out in the lava beds, furnished an undisturbed nestling-place for\r\nflocks of a beautiful sea-swallow, with glossy black head, silver-grey\r\nbody, and bill and feet of carmine red--the most elegant and attractive\r\ncontrast of colours that can well be imagined upon any bird. These pretty\r\ncreatures afforded great amusement to the sportsmen of our little party,\r\nwhile the geologist acquired a better idea and more information as to the\r\nmineralogy and geognosis of the island beneath the steep wall of rock,\r\nthan he could have obtained above, where all seemed to be covered with\r\nthick green grass. But the botanist and zoologist found but little to\r\nrepay their search on the beach. The same _Algæ_, the same grasses, the\r\nsame _patellæ_ (limpets), as at St. Paul, even to the same caterpillars\r\nswarming upon every tuft of grass in numberless quantities. At several\r\npoints, fresh, perfectly good, sweet spring-water trickled down from the\r\nheights, and we could thus confirm the relations of former explorers, that\r\nthe island contains fresh water; but whether it can be got at, still\r\nremains a very uncertain question. As we were convinced, after several\r\nexaminations and much exertion, that to ascend the precipice from this\r\nspot was impossible, it was resolved, after the men had rested, and a few\r\nobservations had been made with the sextant, to re-embark and endeavour to\r\nfind a more suitable spot for disembarking.\r\n\r\nWe quitted this first spot about 2 P.M., and continued to steer along the\r\ncoast in a N.E. direction. The character of the scenery remained almost\r\nunaltered. The steep shore wall indeed dipped somewhat occasionally, but\r\nit was never less than 100 feet above the level of the sea. At various\r\npoints there appeared, as at St. Paul, between the tufa strata, black\r\nveins of basalt, and fragments of scoriæ, lying upon reddish-brown slag.\r\nOur curiosity, however, was especially excited by the appearance of small\r\ntrees and low bushes. At first, while we were yet at some distance, we\r\ncould barely distinguish a few dark, clear, green spots amid the universal\r\ndull olive appearance of the vegetation that covered the island; now that\r\nwe were keeping closer in, we plainly saw small trees, which seemed most\r\nto resemble forests of pine, as also what appeared to be thick close\r\nbrushwood of a light green colour, with which large patches of the middle\r\nand lower slopes of the island were covered. In vain did we watch for some\r\nspot in this singular island at which we might land and climb; at length,\r\nafter steering several miles further along the coast, and passing several\r\npromontories advancing from the island, and numerous isolated rocks, we\r\ncame, towards 3.30 P.M., upon a number of lava-blocks that had fallen from\r\nabove, and, forming a sort of dam or bulwark between the sea and the\r\nshore, seemed to render disembarkation possible. The boat's anchor was\r\nagain dropped, and we proceeded to make for the shore by dint of jumping,\r\nas before, from rock to rock; a method of reaching land more agreeable and\r\nbetter suited to penguins than decorous philosophers!\r\n\r\nAmong the rocks on the strand lie fragments of shipwrecked vessels--pieces\r\nof masts and yards--dumb witnesses of human disaster, and suffering, and\r\ndeath! At this point the shore was not very steep. The masses of rock\r\npiled here on each other in wild confusion, made our ascent more\r\npracticable than at our former landing-place, though perhaps they\r\nnecessitated greater circumspection. Dr. Hochstetter and M. Zelebor, as\r\nalso Lieutenant Kronowetter, and a sailor, started for the height. A\r\nridge, grown over with grass and rushes, and forming a line of\r\ncommunication between the upper and lower portions of the island, seemed\r\nthe most accessible point. at which to mount to the high ground above. At\r\nfirst the path led over the colossal rampart of broken rocks and through\r\nthe surf, after which came clumps of rushes and clods, in which the former\r\ngrew, and thence upwards over masses of slag. It was a regular Sisyphean\r\ntask. On the loose rolling _débris_ beneath the feet, for every five feet\r\nforwards, one slipped four backward, so that to climb this height of\r\nlittle over 100 feet, took nearly a whole hour. At last the adventurous\r\nscramblers stood on the top of the island, on a small bare cone of scoriæ,\r\nwhence they were able to overlook a portion of the ground. Dense rush-like\r\ngrass, as high as a man, thickly covered the entire surface--\r\nhalf-withered, half of a lively green; here broken short off by wind and\r\nrain, there still standing erect. Further progress was not to be thought\r\nof, not even as far as the green clump of bushes which had already been\r\nobserved from the boat, although it was scarcely a hundred paces distant,\r\non the surface of the declivity, and although a closer examination\r\npromised to afford many interesting details as to the vegetation on the\r\nisland. It would have been necessary to make one's way either through\r\nheaps of withered rushes, requiring to be broken down at every moment, or\r\nacross thick, matted, fresh, slippery grass, in order to get anywhere near\r\nthe copse that resembled the pinewood. Moreover, owing to the short\r\nallowance of daylight that remained, both were for the present\r\ninaccessible.[75] Evening was coming on, and it was necessary to think of\r\nour return, as we were at a distance of at least eight miles from the\r\nfrigate. With the help of pocket-handkerchiefs, which they had tied to the\r\nreeds, the explorers readily found again the place at which they had\r\nascended, and now speedily returned to the improvised landing-place,\r\nwhere, meanwhile, the naturalists that had remained behind had occupied\r\nthemselves with collecting specimens on the beach, and amid the\r\nsurrounding rocks. A singular spectacle now presented itself to the\r\nastonished view. A couple of lucifer matches that had been thrown aside\r\nwithout further thought, had burst into flames amid the parched rush beds,\r\nand dense volumes of black smoke forthwith rose upon the surface of the\r\nisland. The fire speedily spreading among the thick dry grass, soon\r\nassumed a formidable breadth, and ere long a considerable portion of the\r\neast coast of the island was in a light flame. There was now presented to\r\nthe members of the _Novara_ expedition, the same spectacle as that\r\nwitnessed by the naturalists of the _Recherche_, when D'Entrecasteaux\r\npassed here some sixty years before. It may safely be assumed that the\r\nfire, and the thick wreaths of smoke then visible were like those of\r\nto-day, the result of man's hands, and not of subterranean forces--in\r\nfact, kindled in all probability by fishermen, who were clearing this\r\nuninhabitable island of the close impervious brushwood that so greatly\r\nimpedes locomotion, and were rendering it capable of being traversed, as\r\nwell as susceptible of cultivation. During the night of 7th and 8th\r\nDecember, 1857, the sky was clear and cloudless, and the flames crackled\r\nand leaped high above the beach, in an elliptical area, which must have\r\nmeasured a couple of miles in its major axis. A dense, copper-coloured,\r\nluminous cloud of smoke rose straight into the air, where it spread out\r\nhorizontally, till at last a long trail of smoke stretched in a S.E.\r\ndirection to the farthest horizon, entirely covering the upper part of\r\nthe island. About 2 A.M., according to the report of the officer of the\r\nwatch, the spectacle was still more grand and imposing. The conflagration\r\nat that time extended over an immense surface, so that the imagination\r\nmight naturally enough be disposed to regard this as the bursting forth of\r\nthe pent-up flames of a volcano, with the usual accompaniments of red-hot\r\nstreams of lava, clouds of floating ashes, and pillars of flame mounting\r\nto heaven.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: One of the shipwrecked crew of the _Meridian_, in an article\r\nin the _Nautical Magazine_, for 1854, p. 75, describes at some length the\r\ndifficulties of access to this island. We quote it here as a supplement to\r\nour own experiences:--\"After we had clambered up to the top by means of\r\nropes, and after much exertion and considerable danger, we found the\r\nisland for a space of two or three miles thickly covered with reeds, from\r\n5 to 8 feet high; behind rose a lofty hill, also clothed with reeds.\r\nFortunately, during our stay on the island, there was a sufficiency of\r\nfresh water, although in summer, in all probability, there is a great\r\nscarcity. So long as we remained, constant rain fell upon the summit of\r\nthe mountain, and kept the numerous little brooks full of water. In order\r\nto signal our situation to any ship that might be passing, we set the\r\nreeds on fire; but the flames spread more furiously than we had\r\nanticipated, so that our lives were endangered. A considerable quantity of\r\nyoung birds were picked up, which had fallen victims to the flames. On the\r\n29th August, to our great joy, a ship, the _Monmouth_, hove in sight, and\r\nobserved our signal; but the surf was at this time so violent that no boat\r\ncould reach us. At last, on 31st August, a boat came near enough to the\r\nshore to make us a signal to proceed eastward over the rocks. We set off\r\nat once, but found the path very rugged, and owing to the immense masses\r\nof rock lying around, excessively difficult. Besides reeds and brushwood,\r\nthere were no other plants but parsley and endive (_cichorium intybus_).\r\nDuring the first half of the following day we found no water, but we found\r\nthe hail very grateful, which day and night fell incessantly, alternating\r\nwith rain. At the first watering-place we came upon an English sailor,\r\nwhom the captain of the _Monmouth_ had despatched to assist us. He\r\ninformed us we must make for the north side of the island, as no boat\r\ncould reach the shore at the spot where we had gone ashore. The\r\nsouth-coast is the worst part of the island; there the surf breaks\r\ncontinually against the iron-bound coast; there is nothing resembling a\r\nbeach--only here and there enormous blocks of a hard species of stone,\r\nthat have fallen from time to time from the cliffs above. On 2nd\r\nSeptember, we had neither provisions nor water. The following day,\r\nhowever, we found water, and a few cabbage-stalks, which several years\r\nbefore had been sown by some whalers, and fortunately had thrived. On 5th\r\nSeptember, we reached what is called the Cabbage Garden, and the same\r\nevening arrived at the place where the boat was awaiting us.\"]\r\n\r\nFortunately, this gigantic conflagration must have done far more good than\r\nharm to this desolate island, covered as it was for the most part with\r\nreeds, since, without destroying any of the vegetation that could be of\r\nservice to man, it will greatly facilitate examination by future voyagers,\r\nand adapt it for settlement by fishers and others, who at present seem to\r\nleave it utterly abandoned.\r\n\r\nTowards 6 P.M., as it was already getting dark, our two boats set out on\r\ntheir return to the frigate, from which in the course of the day they had\r\nbeen distant about fifteen miles. However a fresh Northerly breeze having\r\nsprung up we were able to make sail, and at 7.30 P.M. once more reached\r\nthe frigate, when we were received with a storm of questions, principally\r\nturning upon the mysterious far-visible conflagration,--which had been\r\nkindled by a couple of humble Vienna lucifers! During our visit to the\r\nisland a variety of observations were also made on board the frigate, to\r\nobtain the position of Amsterdam, as also to determine the elevation of\r\nthe most prominent peaks of the island, and the outline of the shore. The\r\nresults of these gave the following: latitude 37° 58' 30'' S.; longitude,\r\n77° 34,' 44'' E. of Greenwich; elevation of the highest summit (nearly\r\ncorresponding with previous observations), 2891 English feet; of the\r\nsecond highest, 2651 feet; the length of the South coast, as measured from\r\nthe frigate, 32,359 feet; of the Western shore, 5507 feet.\r\n\r\nThere was still some faint hope that we might visit the island next day.\r\nHowever, during the night the wind sprung up, the weather became variable,\r\nand we saw ourselves compelled to renounce our cherished desire to\r\ninvestigate the island thoroughly, the rather that, owing to the\r\nunpropitious weather during the last few weeks, the stay of the _Novara_\r\nin these latitudes had been prolonged so considerably beyond the period\r\nfixed, that no more time could be spared, if it were desirous to avoid\r\nsacrificing the objects of the Expedition with reference to other and more\r\nimportant departments of scientific enquiry, by engaging in them at a\r\nseason in all probability highly unfavourable for the purpose.\r\n\r\nConsequently our observations in Amsterdam remained most imperfect;\r\nalthough the geologist of the expedition was enabled to clear up the\r\nuncertainty hitherto prevailing as to the geological structure of the\r\nisland, and to determine upon scientific data, that Amsterdam is an\r\nextinct volcanic cone, of precisely the same character, and belonging to\r\nthe same order of volcanic formation as the sister island of St. Paul;\r\nthat it probably contains on itself all the usual indications of its\r\nvolcanic origin, and that its upheaval probably took place at the same\r\nperiod. On the other hand, the naturalist regretted to see slip the\r\nopportunity so rarely vouchsafed, of instituting a comparison between the\r\nrespective vegetations of these islands, and of making evident how,\r\nsimultaneously with the advance of a more luxuriant, and more multiform\r\nvegetable organization, there also appears an entirely new race of\r\nanimals, and how closely allied in the economy of nature is the existence\r\nof individual specimens with certain fixed pre-existent types. In any case\r\nSt. Paul, which we enjoyed an opportunity of examining in the utmost\r\ndetail, is, of the two islands, the most important to the commerce of the\r\nworld, not merely as a finger-post on the most frequented deep-sea route\r\nin the Indian Ocean, but also as a haven of refuge for ships and crews.\r\nAlready the crater-basin of St. Paul has served in case of need as a\r\ndesirable asylum for ships that are half unseaworthy. Not many years since\r\nan English man-of-war steamer came to St. Paul, after a severe storm in\r\nthe Indian Ocean, during which her engine broke down, and her rudder was\r\nknocked away, after which she, for twelve days, was steered by a temporary\r\nrudder. The vessel, after discharging the heaviest part of her equipment,\r\nwas easily brought into the interior of the crater-basin, and was there\r\nhove down for several months on the Northern barrier, undergoing repairs.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th December, about 4 A.M., only a dark cloud of smoke in the\r\ndistant cloudless horizon indicated the position of Amsterdam. The island\r\nitself, properly speaking, was actually out of sight, for a fresh N.W.\r\nbreeze had driven us merrily along during the night. The last hope was now\r\ndissipated of being able to obtain a view of the North side of Amsterdam.\r\nWe were now rapidly approaching the region of the S.E. Trades. The breeze\r\nfreshened and crept gradually to the West, thence to the South, and\r\nfinally to the Eastward. This veering of the wind proved to be a\r\nfore-runner of the Trades, which we got into on 14th December, in S.\r\nlatitude 28° 1', E. longitude 85°.\r\n\r\nOn that day a merchantman hove in sight, which, with favouring breezes and\r\nall sail set, soon bore down on us. She came down without any flag, and\r\nstood right across our bows at so short a distance that we could plainly\r\nread her name--the _Bunker's Hill_, of Boston--on her stern. Thereupon we\r\nran up our flag; and, as it is as gross a breach of the code of maritime\r\npoliteness for a ship to pass across the bows of another in the open ocean\r\nwithout saluting, as for a man on land to brush quickly across another's\r\npath without apologizing, a blank shot was fired at this unmannerly\r\nAmerican. To this manifestation etiquette lays it down that, as the\r\nhoisting of her flag by a man-of-war is a direct challenge for any\r\nmerchantman that may be in sight to hoist its flag, any neglect of these\r\nuniversally recognized rules must involuntarily give rise to suspicions.\r\nAfter we had fired the blank shot, the American, by a telegraph of\r\nflag-signals, enquired the latitude and longitude, which in merchant ships\r\nin the open sea is pretty frequently resorted to, in order to know where\r\nprecisely they are, as they are not able to make such frequent\r\nobservations as ships of war. Before anything else, however, it was\r\nnecessary to settle the question of saluting; and this the obstinate\r\nYankee, in spite of the warning signal, seemed resolved not to notice,\r\nalthough he well knew the seriousness of his position, as was abundantly\r\nevident in the celerity with which several ladies and gentlemen, whom we\r\ncould discern on deck, flew to seek shelter below! A second report,\r\naccompanied by a ball over his stern, at last brought this pertinacious\r\ncaptain to his senses, and the whistling of the shot had the desired\r\neffect. The \"Stars and Stripes\" were run up, upon which we signalled the\r\nrequired latitude and longitude. Probably it was but a petulant explosion\r\nof a silly national vanity, as also the consciousness of commanding a\r\nhandsome crack \"clipper,\" that could speedily run out of gun-shot, which\r\nled to this premeditated and persistent violation of one of the most\r\nordinary rules of politeness. Indeed, even the vessels of the North\r\nAmerican navy itself are frequently compelled in the open sea to treat\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen in a similar manner; and the captain of the\r\nwar-steamer _Minnesota_, looking after the North American interests in\r\nChina, was obliged, as we learned afterwards at Shanghai, to enforce a\r\ncompliance with established sea usages on one of his seafaring\r\ncompatriots, by dint of cannon-shot, in accordance with the undoubted\r\npractice of all maritime nations.\r\n\r\nThe south-east Trade, which we had hoped would drive us on our destined\r\ncourse, was not so strong or so steady as we had expected, chiefly\r\nperhaps in consequence of the influence exercised by the Australian\r\ncontinent, the temperature of which during this, the summer season of the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere, is raised to an extraordinary degree by its sandy\r\nsurface, that when the air has become thus warmed, it ascends and becomes\r\nmore rarefied in its lower strata, in consequence of which its elasticity\r\nbecomes so great as to drive back the surrounding colder atmosphere, and\r\nonly admit it to contact with the heated air at its most remote limits.\r\nThis occurs the more readily, that the heated air, after it has risen to\r\nthe more rarefied tracts, expands on all sides, and at a certain distance\r\nfrom the lower level, begins to add to the pressure of the atmosphere. In\r\nthis self-acting zone of increased atmospheric pressure, the winds,\r\nhowever, are naturally more faint, and, to observers who happen to be on\r\nthe exterior of this zone, always appear to take their rise from the\r\nfurther side. For this reason, probably, we fell in with easterly breezes,\r\nso long as we had the Northern portion of Australia to the eastward of us.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the equilibrium of the air seemed to be disturbed, as we\r\ncould plainly perceive from the weather and the confused sea. At last on\r\n18th December, the heavens seemed somewhat more propitious, though the\r\nwind still continued easterly; indeed occasionally blew from the north,\r\nand frequent squalls of rain poured pitilessly down upon us. The more,\r\nhowever, we increased our distance from the Australian continent, that is,\r\nfrom all land to the eastward, the more steadily blew the south east\r\nTrade. And so we kept standing steadily forwards, till at last, on the\r\n24th December, in 6° 4' S. Lat., and 82° 34' E. Long., we reached the\r\neastern boundaries of the Trades and got into that of calms.\r\n\r\nThe heat, which thus far had spared us, began now to be most oppressive,\r\nand was felt all the more owing to the air being extraordinarily damp and\r\ndense. Frequently in the afternoon a passing shower of rain, which would\r\nsometimes completely flood the deck, would cool the air for a few fleeting\r\nmoments. Occasionally indeed we had westerly and more rarely\r\nnorth-westerly breezes, but these were never of long duration, and were\r\nincessantly broken by rains and squalls.\r\n\r\nAnd at this same season, at which in our distant Fatherland, palace and\r\nhut are decked out with unwonted attention, when golden fruits and elegant\r\npresents glitter from the green fir-branches of the Christmas Tree, all\r\nlit up with the neat little wax-tapers, when man's heart seems to overflow\r\nwith cheerfulness and love of his fellow-creatures,--at this season we\r\nwere languishing far from our dear ones, tormented with the intense heat,\r\nscarcely able to realize to ourselves, that at home it must now be snow\r\nand frost, while keen Boreas is whirling the snowflakes aloft, and howling\r\na grim accompaniment the while! However, we promised ourselves the\r\nsatisfaction of enjoying these pleasures at our own firesides, whereupon\r\nour recollections of home and dear friends imparted to our minds a\r\nwholesome stimulus, arising from the soul-inspiring conviction, that we\r\ntoo were present in their minds and hearts at this hallowed season. Nay,\r\nseveral of the officers of the _Novara_ Expedition were surprised when\r\nfar at sea, in the very midst of the Indian Ocean, with Christmas gifts,\r\nwhich thoughtful friends had many months before entrusted to the care of\r\ndiscreet fellow-voyagers.\r\n\r\nAfter constantly struggling against calms and contrary winds, exactly at\r\nthe first stroke of the New Year, at midnight of 31st December-1st\r\nJanuary, we reached the Equator, which we were now crossing for the second\r\ntime, and began the year 1858 in the Northern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nOn this New Year's Day we had nearly had a great disaster. A lad who was\r\ncoming down the shrouds fell overboard. The sea was perfectly calm and\r\nsmooth, but already on the morning of this very day we had seen many\r\nsharks, those dreaded foes of man in the domain of ocean, so that the life\r\nof the unfortunate youth seemed seriously imperilled. The same instant in\r\nwhich the youth fell, saw a life-buoy thrown over, a boat prepared for\r\nlowering, and all usual appliances for a rescue made available. But\r\nalthough an excellent swimmer, he seemed to lose all presence of mind,\r\nprobably through fear, and must undoubtedly have been drowned, had not the\r\nboatswain's mate, and two other sailors, leaped into the water and made\r\nall haste to his assistance. Meanwhile the boat had been got into the\r\nwater, by which rescued and rescuers were got safe on board again.\r\n\r\nA few months later, the boatswain's mate, for his gallant conduct on this\r\noccasion, received, by the express orders of His Majesty, the silver cross\r\nof merit, while the sailors were advanced one grade.\r\n\r\nThe current, which runs northward along the coast of Australia, but turns\r\noff to the westward about the tenth degree of South latitude, so as to\r\npass southward of Ceylon, directly along the Equator to the Coast of\r\nAfrica, carried us far to the westward, in consequence of which we had\r\novercast, uncertain weather, with, for the most part, calms or light\r\nbreezes. As we found ourselves approaching the fourth degree of Northern\r\nlatitude, a rather fresh N.E. wind sprung up, probably the trade wind of\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere, which, however, as we neared Ceylon, again died\r\naway to a calm.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in lat. 5° 32' N., 79° 5' E., we fell in with a current\r\nrunning more than two miles an hour. We had, as it turned out, got to the\r\nwestward of the roadstead of Point de Galle, in Ceylon, and found some\r\nlittle difficulty in making headway against the current. On 7th January,\r\ntoward 3.30 P.M., land was made to the eastward, and an hour later, a\r\nCingalese canoe was perceived making for the frigate under sail. It was\r\nthe pilot boat, whose crew, having been informed by a Hamburg brig that a\r\nlarge ship was in sight, had put to sea to meet us.\r\n\r\nAt the first sight of this little canoe, it was hardly possible to refrain\r\nfrom amazement at the courage and hardihood with which the half-naked\r\nCingalese boatmen could put off some 30 or 40 miles to sea in such a tiny,\r\nnarrow boat, that barely gives them room to sit lengthwise. Two\r\ncross-bars, or outriggers, projecting on one side, where they are\r\nfastened externally to a rather massive beam, which swims parallel with\r\nthe boat, gave this canoe, apparently so fragile, such stability and\r\nseaworthiness, that it is at all times not less safe than a boat of\r\nEuropean construction.[76]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: These canoes resemble very closely the \"proas,\" of the\r\nPolynesian Islands, carrying a beam on one side, which is quite straight,\r\nand always kept on the lee of the wind and sea, the change of course being\r\neffected by simply shifting the sail, and steering with the paddle from\r\nthe opposite end.]\r\n\r\nThe natives steer with short paddles, and continue an incredibly long time\r\nat this most exhausting work, as we must conceive it to be. And yet they\r\nare to appearance a feeble race, except that the muscular system of the\r\nupper part of the body is remarkably developed.\r\n\r\nThe dress of these people is remarkably simple, and usually consists only\r\nof a piece of coloured linen cloth or calico, which, worn short like a\r\nwoman's petticoat, is thrown single-fold round the loins.\r\n\r\nThe pilot, though he could only make himself intelligible in broken\r\nEnglish, speedily came to a good understanding, and offered to sell us\r\nbananas, pine-apples, and cocoa-nuts, as also Ceylon jewels, the latter of\r\nwhich he carried on his person, secured in a parti-coloured cotton belt.\r\nThis reminded us that we were nearing the shores of the country in which\r\ncostly stones are found, but precisely on that account, as was natural,\r\nour speculative pilot found but a poor market for his wares.\r\n\r\nOff the coast we caught a shark 7 feet long, and 135 lbs. weight--a rather\r\njuvenile specimen--whose teeth, which we examined, were already strong\r\nand sharp enough to seize a man, and strip the flesh off him. Also a\r\nnumber of large dolphins and other fish, sported in the dead water under\r\nthe frigate's stern, and provided plentiful employment for the harpoon and\r\nthe rod. Presently we found ourselves within six miles of the land, when a\r\nlarge number of pirogues forthwith came swarming about us, all of a\r\nconstruction similar to the pilot boat, and each manned by four half-naked\r\nbronze natives. These offered fruits for sale, especially magnificent,\r\ngigantic clusters of banana. On one such cluster we counted, arranged in\r\nfive rows, one over the other, not less than 175 bananas.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th January, we anchored in the unpicturesque haven of Point de\r\nGalle, surrounded by groves of cocoa-nut palms, directly opposite the\r\nlighthouse tower, and in a fine quartz sand bottom of 16-1/2 fathoms (103\r\nfeet English). All large ships, that only intend remaining a short time,\r\nanchor in the open roadstead, the entrance into the inner harbour being\r\nrather difficult, owing to numerous coral reefs. In the roads also lay the\r\nEnglish frigate _Shannon_, from which, in the absence of her captain, the\r\nfirst lieutenant immediately came on board the _Novara_, and in the\r\nhandsomest manner put his services at our disposal.\r\n\r\nAs the only Austrian Consul on the island was resident in Colombo, M.\r\nSonnenkalb, the Consul for Hamburg, had the courtesy to receive us with\r\nthe most hospitable of welcomes, and proceeded to do us the honours of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th we hauled the frigate into the small inner harbour, in order\r\nto facilitate the shipping of stores. The entrance is rather winding,\r\nowing to the numerous shoals, and it is with some little difficulty that\r\none can find a comfortable, commodious berth among such a crowd of\r\nshipping. We only saluted the flag of the dominant nationality--a\r\ncustomary courtesy--and were replied to by the batteries on shore. An\r\nofficer of the frigate was then dispatched to announce our arrival to the\r\ngovernor of the station--a major in the English army. This gentleman\r\nseemed not to think it incumbent on him to put himself in the least out of\r\nhis way for us. Indeed, we even experienced some little difficulty in\r\nprocuring a sufficient supply of drinking water for shipment as stores;\r\nbut we must at the same time add, in justice to the representatives of\r\nEngland in distant countries, that during our entire voyage this was the\r\none solitary instance in which English military official men did not\r\ndisplay that universal readiness to oblige, which, to their credit, is so\r\nconspicuously and so kindly displayed by them in their intercourse with\r\nforeign nations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CINGALESE CANOE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF ADAM'S PEAK FROM COLOMBO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               VIII.\r\n\r\n                               Ceylon.\r\n\r\n                   STAY FROM 8TH TO 16TH JAN., 1858.\r\n\r\n   Neglect of the Island hitherto by the English Government.--\r\n     Better Prospects for the Future.--The Cingalese, their\r\n     Language and Customs.--Buddhism and its Ordinances.--Visit to\r\n     a Buddhist Temple in the Vicinity of Galle.--The sacred\r\n     Bo-tree.--Other Aborigines of Ceylon.--The Weddàhs.--\r\n     Traditions as to their Origin.--Galle as a City and Harbour.--\r\n     Snake-charmers.--Departure for Colombo.--Cultivation of the\r\n     Cocoa-nut Palm, a benevolent, Buddha-pleasing work.--\r\n     Polyandria; or, Community of Husbands.--Supposed Origin.--\r\n     Annual Exportation of Cocoa-nuts.--Rest-houses for\r\n     Travellers.--Curry, the National Dish.--A Misfortune and its\r\n     Consequences.--The Catholic Mission of St. Sebastian de Makun,\r\n     and Father Miliani.--Annoying Delays with restive Horses.--\r\n     Colombo.--A Stroll through the \"_Pettah_\" or Black Town.--Ice\r\n     Trade of the Americans with Tropical Countries.--Cinnamon\r\n     Gardens and Cinnamon Cultivation.--Consequences of the\r\n     Monopoly of Cinnamon.--Rise and Expansion of the Coffee\r\n     Culture in Ceylon.--Pearl-fishery.--Latest Examination of the\r\n     Ceylon Banks of Pearl Oysters, by Dr. Kelaart, and its\r\n     Results.--Aripo at the Season of Pearl-fishing.--The Divers.--\r\n     Pearl-lime, a Chewing Substance of wealthy Malays;--Annual\r\n     Profit of the Pearl-fishery.--Origin of the Pearl.--Poetry\r\n     and Natural Science.--Artificial Production of the Pearl.--The\r\n     Chank-shell--The Wealth of Ceylon in Precious Stones.--Visit\r\n     to a Cocoa-nut Oil Manufactory.--The Cowry-shell, a Promoter\r\n     of the Slave Trade.--Discovery of valuable Cingalese MSS. on\r\n     Palm-leaves.--The heroic Poem of \"Mahawwanso,\" and Turner's\r\n     English Translation of it.--Hospitality of English Officials\r\n     in Colombo.--A second Visit to Father Miliani.--Agreeable\r\n     Reception.--The Antidote-oil against Bites of Poisonous\r\n     Snakes.--Adventures on the Journey back to Galle.--Ascent of\r\n     Adam's Peak by two Members of the Expedition.--The sacred\r\n     Footprint.--Descent.--The \"Bullock-bandy,\" or Native Waggon.--\r\n     Departure from Galle for Madras.--The Bassos (shallows).--A\r\n     Berlin Rope-dancer among the Passengers.--Nyctalopia; or,\r\n     Night Blindness.--Fire on board.--Arrival in Madras Roads.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inquirer who becomes acquainted by personal examination with the\r\nimportant geographical position of the Island of Ceylon (called also\r\nSeilan or Singhala), her commodious harbours, her productiveness, and her\r\nmarvellous climate, involuntarily wonders at the stepmother's part that\r\nEngland has hitherto played with respect to this renowned island of palms\r\nand spices, the Malta of the Indian Ocean, which of all the British\r\npossessions in distant parts of the earth, has, till recently, received\r\nthe least care or attention.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind, however, that Ceylon is an appanage of the\r\nBritish Crown, and it is not an independent, self-supporting colony. Those\r\nshortcomings of administration, for which the mother country is\r\nexclusively responsible, have been hitherto a complete drag upon her\r\ndevelopment. But the English people have this advantage over all other\r\nnations, that once anything has been recognized to be useful and\r\nimperatively required, they proceed to apply it with such energy, that\r\nthey are enabled to make up for any neglect with giant strides. During\r\nlate years many fetters have been knocked off which formerly impeded the\r\nmore active development of agriculture and commerce. The harbour of Point\r\nde Galle (also called only Galle for shortness) has become a central\r\nstation for the steam-boat trade with the East Indies, the Burmese\r\nArchipelago, China, and Australia. A telegraphic wire will ere long\r\nstretch from Ceylon to England, such as even now unites the island with\r\nthe Coromandel Coast and India; a railway is in course of construction\r\nbetween the most important commercial centres of the island, and so\r\nobvious are the fundamental benefits it must confer, that ere long the\r\nclassical and incomparably beautiful island of Ceylon is destined to shine\r\na star of the first magnitude in the azure of the Indian Ocean, one of the\r\nmost prosperous, wealthy, and blest of islands!\r\n\r\nThe scientific researches of all kinds, which have in modern days been\r\ninstituted in Ceylon, have been attended with the most important results,\r\nbearing upon its history and its various tribes, as well as on its natural\r\nwealth; and the masterly and marvellous work Sir Emerson Tennent lately\r\npublished on the isle of Ceylon, seems intended to compensate for many\r\ninstances of neglect which Ceylon and its inhabitants have experienced\r\nfrom the English since they seized on it.\r\n\r\nEmbracing all the three kingdoms of nature, and following up with learned\r\naccuracy the history of the inhabitants, from the obscure traditions\r\nattending their earliest settlement down to the present day, Sir Emerson\r\nTennent's work is a perfect pattern of a monography, although upon this\r\nsubject the German inquirer will involuntarily, and not without an\r\nemotion of pride, recall to mind Carl Ritter's admirable, well-digested\r\npublication upon Ceylon, in his classical work on Eastern Asia, doubly\r\nmeritorious by the very fact that the German scholar never set foot in the\r\ncountry itself. There are, however, indeed few spots on earth which\r\npresent such inexhaustible subjects for the study of the historian as well\r\nas the inquirer into physical science, of the poet and the political\r\neconomist, as this romantically-beautiful island, which we have been\r\ntaught to regard as the Garden of the World, as indeed the special site of\r\nthe Garden of Eden, the first abode of the progenitors of the human race.\r\n\r\nWe have not to do here, as in most of the islands of southern seas, with a\r\nsavage people, that have only, since the first appearance of Europeans,\r\nemerged from a state of barbarism, and been raised one step towards\r\ncivilization, but rather find, as in the East Indies and China, a peculiar\r\ntype of civilization, which, although widely differing from that of\r\nEurope, yet seems not less valuable and extraordinary. The whites (scarce\r\n7000 in number, of whom 2482 are females), who live scattered over an area\r\nof 24,700 English square miles, have hitherto been too few in number to\r\nexercise any marked influence on the customs or mode of life of a native\r\ncoloured population of 1,726,640 souls, and hence it is that Ceylon\r\nexhibits a more romantic and characteristic air than any other British\r\nsettlement in distant parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nA people like the Cingalese, of such ardent imaginativeness, with a\r\nsplendid history, and a religion professed in the various realms of the\r\nEast by more than 300 millions of people, gains in interest the more we\r\nbecome acquainted with them, and the more we make their traditions, their\r\nmode of life, and their customs, the object of special inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe Cingalese, or indigenous natives (so named to distinguish them from\r\nthe other inhabitants of the island, belonging to other stocks and\r\namalgamated races, who at various periods had settled here, and who call\r\nthemselves Ceylonese), were entirely the offspring of Hindoo emigrants,\r\nwho, about five centuries before the birth of Christ, came from Hindostan\r\nto Ceylon, and imported their own mode of government, and system of caste,\r\nas also their arts, language, and religion, from the continent into the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThey constitute the germ of the present population, and early divided\r\nthemselves into four leading castes:--1st, that of the royal family;--2nd,\r\nthe Brahmins;--3rd, the merchants, peasants, and shepherds;--and 4th, the\r\nsixty inferior common castes. At present there exist in Ceylon only the\r\ntwo latter. The most numerous is that of the peasants, who, however,\r\nmeddle but little with the cultivation of the soil, but have arrogated to\r\nthemselves the exclusive and hereditary possession of all employments, lay\r\nor ecclesiastical. The dress of the Cingalese usually consists of a cloth\r\nwound turban-fashion round their head, and long white drapery. On festive\r\noccasions they wear richly-adorned tight-fitting jackets of velvet or\r\nwool, and on such occasions rank and power assert themselves by the number\r\nof garments, to such an extent that frequently a wealthy man makes his\r\nappearance in several of these habiliments, worn one above the other. The\r\nCingalese are shorter in stature than the Europeans, their average stature\r\nbeing 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 5 inches, English. Their _physique_,\r\nthough graceful and delicate, is powerful and muscular, with a brawny\r\nbreast, broad shoulders, the muscles of the thigh strongly developed, but\r\nwith disproportionately small hands and feet. Their colour is commonly a\r\nlight-brown, their hair black and quite straight. The women are\r\nbeautifully formed, but even when they can, like Asokamalla of historic\r\nfame, boast all the forty and six marks of the Cingalese ideal,[77] they\r\nmust fall far short of the European standard of female beauty, with their\r\nbodies anointed with oil, and their mouths stained with the betel-nut. As\r\nthe Cingalese girls usually marry so early as 12 years of age, they\r\nspeedily lose the bloom of youth, and frequently have the appearance of\r\ncrones at 20. Another especially loathsome habit of the Cingalese is the\r\nchewing the betel-nut, a custom so universally prevalent among all Indian\r\nraces, that not merely the men and women, but the very children exhibit an\r\nextraordinary predilection for it. The ingredients of this masticatory\r\nconsist of the green tender leaves of the Betel-pepper-shrub (_Piper\r\nbetle_), the nut of the areca-palm (_Areca catechu_, or cabbage-tree),\r\nsome lime made of calcined shells, and tobacco, which, according to the\r\nrank of the individual, they keep ready prepared by their side, in silver\r\nor brass boxes, resembling snuff-boxes. These corrosive substances at the\r\nsame time stain the saliva so deep a red, that, after long use, the lips\r\nand teeth seem as though smeared with blood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: Of these forty-six perfections of womanly beauty we extract\r\nthe following by way of example, from a Cingalese author:--hair, glossy as\r\nthe tail of a peacock, and hanging in ringlets to the knee, eye-brows like\r\nthe rainbow, eyes like sapphire, and the leaves of the manilla flower, a\r\nhawk nose, lips lustrous and red as coral, teeth small and regular, like\r\nthe buds of the jasmine, neck thick and round, haunches broad, breast\r\nfirm, and conical like the cocoa-nut, the figure slight, capable of being\r\nspanned by the hand, the limbs spindle-shaped, the sole of the foot\r\nwithout any hollow, the skin free from any prominence of the bones,\r\nsweeping in rounded curves, soft and tender.]\r\n\r\nThe language is an offshoot of the Sanscrit, copious, harmonious, and full\r\nof expression, with threefold grammar, and as many vocabularies, viz. for\r\nthe royal tongue, the official or court tongue, and that of society at\r\nlarge. To these there must be added the Pali, the learned, but obsolete\r\nwritten language of the priestly caste, which the Cingalese have in common\r\nwith the kingdoms of Siam and Ava, in the further Indies. In this\r\nlanguage, itself but a dialect of the Sanscrit, all their sacred books,\r\ntraditions, and poetry are written. In many parts of the island the\r\nknowledge of language and written lore are held in such high honour, that\r\ngrammar and literature form the entire study of the inhabitants. Reading\r\nand writing are as common among the Cingalese as in England, except that\r\nin Ceylon the women take no part therein. They do not write as we do, with\r\nquill or steel pen upon paper, but engrave the characters with a\r\nfine-pointed iron graver, or _stylus_, upon the leaves of the Talipot\r\npalm-tree (_Corypha umbraculifera_), from which they slice a broad strip\r\nfor the purpose about 2 feet long, and several inches broad. These require\r\nno further preparation than that they must be well smoothed beforehand,\r\nand all inequalities removed. In order to render the writing more clear\r\nand legible, the Cingalese rub it with a mixture of cocoa-nut oil and fine\r\npulverized wood-ashes, which imparts to it durability and prevents\r\nobliteration. Great numbers, however, use the leaves of another species of\r\npalm for writing upon, viz. the Palmyra palm (_Borassus flabelliformis_),\r\nbut those of the Talipot are preferred to all others for their closeness\r\nof texture, and are alone used in important records and other documents.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Cingalese is Buddhism, which in Ceylon still\r\nflourishes in these times in all its pristine vigour. Buddha is not the\r\nname of the founder of this belief, who is called Gautama, or Sakja-Muni,\r\nbut is only one of the numerous titles of honour invented by that\r\npersonage, who in the Sanscrit figures so conspicuously as a sage. Gautama\r\nwas born in the province of Maghada (now known as Reha), in Northern\r\nHindostan, B.C. 624. His parents were Suddhodana, King of Magadha, and his\r\nconsort Maja. Contemplating the degeneracy and misery of man, sunk in\r\ndeepest woe, Gautama attacked the doctrine of Brahma, rejected the Vedas,\r\nor holy books, and founded the new faith, which consists of the following\r\nfundamental propositions:--The Creator and Ruler of the world is a\r\nsupreme, invisible, purely spiritual (and for that reason obviously\r\nimpossible to be figured) Being, almighty, wise, just, beneficent, and\r\nmerciful. Man most fitly recognizes and honours the Deity by silent\r\ncontemplation: by the practice of chastity, temperance, and virtue he\r\nattains to happiness. The complete fulfilment of all his duties confers on\r\nhim here on earth the dignity of a Buddha, or sage, and after death\r\nconsigns him to the beatific repose of _non-existence_[78] (_Nirwana_).\r\nCondemned souls are born again in the forms of wild animals. According to\r\nGautama's teaching a fresh Buddha always appears at certain epochs, whose\r\nexistence is manifested by his extraordinary spiritual powers, by his\r\ndeeds, and by his prophecies, selected by destiny for the purpose of\r\nenlightening the world as to the decrees of the Supreme Being, and to\r\nrestore religion to her pristine purity. The death of a Buddha is also the\r\ncommencement of a new reckoning of time. Gautama, who died about B.C. 542,\r\nor some 2400 years since, was the forty-fifth and last Buddha that\r\nappeared to the Cingalese; his doctrine must continue to operate for 5000\r\nyears, when, according to the Cingalese traditions, the next Buddha, or\r\nPurifier, will appear. Gautama's belief, bequeathed by him to his\r\ndisciple, the Brahmin Mahakaja, was immediately translated into Sanscrit,\r\nand speedily spread. Several hundred temples and monuments dedicated to\r\nhim are scattered in various parts of the island, and remain to this day\r\nan evidence of the extent and influence of Buddhism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: The ten precepts of the moral code of Buddhism are as\r\nfollows:--Kill no living creature--do not steal--follow no unclean\r\noccupation--tell no lies or untruths--drink no fermented liquors--live\r\nexclusively on vegetables--anoint neither the head nor the body--go to no\r\nsinging parties or spectacles--do not sleep on a raised nor on a wide bed--\r\neat but once a day, and before noon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUDDHA TEMPLE NEAR GALLE.]\r\n\r\nOn the day of our arrival we at once set off to visit one of these\r\nBuddhist temples, in the vicinity of Galle. The edifice is small and\r\ninsignificant, only the carved woodwork of the door presenting any object\r\nof interest as a work of art. In the interior is a gigantic figure of\r\nBuddha, carved in wood, and in a reclining position; it is 20 feet long,\r\nand painted yellow and red, with long flaps to the ears, and a lotus\r\nflower on the head; while on the walls around, richly decorated with\r\nscrollwork, dragons and lions, part painted, part sculptured, various\r\ninteresting episodes are represented in the history of Buddhism. Right in\r\nfront of the figure are placed a number of offerings of the most\r\nmiscellaneous description, beneath which are flowers and fruits; a small\r\ntin box is also particularly conspicuous, into which every stranger is\r\nexpected to drop a piece of silver by way of present. Adjoining such a\r\ntemple are always to be found the _wiharas_, or residences of the priests\r\n(_hamaduruhs_), and the spot where preaching and teaching are carried on.\r\nThe priests wear long wide vestures, yellow or white according to their\r\nrank, or else only a single yellow outer garment, which falls in the form\r\nof graceful drapery over the naked shoulders; their heads are shaved, and\r\nthey walk about quite barefoot, with a parasol of Talipot palm in their\r\nhand, and observe with strangers a reserved, distrustful demeanour.\r\n\r\nWe were conducted all round by a young priest, of about 20 years of age,\r\nwho spoke a little English, which is not a very common accomplishment,\r\nsince the Buddhists have a great dislike for all that is foreign. Only at\r\nthe conclusion of our visit did the old, grey, half-blind superior priest\r\nmake his appearance, saluted us, but immediately left us to snatch from a\r\nboy a shaddock (_Citrus decumana_), which is especially prized by the\r\nCingalese on account of the refreshing qualities of its juice.\r\n\r\nThe priestly office, however, does not deter a native from indulging the\r\ndisgusting habit of chewing the betel-nut, and this aged _hamaduruh_\r\nbecame much more sociable on receiving some.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the temple, which stands in a charming cocoa-nut grove, we first\r\ngot an idea of the extraordinary luxuriance of the vegetation of this\r\nisland. In a single enclosure, not much larger than an ordinary\r\nhouse-garden, we saw coffee-trees, cinnamon-bushes, clove-trees,\r\nnutmeg-trees, (_Areca catechu_), oranges, lemons, pine-apples, and\r\nbread-fruit trees (_Arctocarpus incisa_), flourishing in wildest\r\nprofusion.\r\n\r\nA second temple, which we also visited, was the Dadále Panzela, the\r\nlargest in the province, and the seat of the high-priest of the Buddhists.\r\nThis worthy personage, a septuagenary, is named Nanalangara Seresumana\r\nMahdamaradjigurù Ganatchari-Naikunangi, and is surrounded by a staff of\r\npriests of the temple who are reputed holy, and who apparently venerate\r\nhim as a superior being. This temple did not differ much in construction\r\nand arrangement from the first; but the place set apart for instruction,\r\nwhere, at the time of our visit, some youths were busily engaged in\r\ncopying the sacred books upon palm leaves, as also the residences of the\r\npriests, made a much more imposing impression, and spoke of a certain\r\ndegree of opulence. In the midst of a piece of ground laid out like a\r\ngarden was planted the sacred Bo-tree, which is looked upon as holy by the\r\nBuddhists, because, according to an ancient tradition, Buddha was in the\r\nhabit of reposing under the shadow of its branches, as often as he visited\r\nthe earth. Towering above everything wherever a Buddhist temple is raised,\r\nthere a Bo-tree is planted; but the particular sacred tree, the original\r\nplant from which the legend took its rise, grows at Anaradnapura, in the\r\nnorthern part of the former kingdom of Kandi, whither it had been suddenly\r\ntranslated from a far-distant land, and spontaneously took root in the\r\nspot where it at present stands, in order to serve as a protection and\r\nshelter for Buddha.[79] Ninety Cingalese monarchs are interred around it,\r\nall of whom, by the temples and statues they erected to Buddha, are deemed\r\nworthy of this pre-eminent mark of distinction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: The sacred Bo-tree (_Ficus religiosa_) of the Buddhists is\r\nfrequently confounded with the Banyan Tree (_Ficus Indica_), held in such\r\nhonour by the Brahmins, from which latter it differs in this, that it does\r\nnot throw out from its branches numberless twigs which take root again in\r\nthe earth. The incessant waving and rustling of the leaves and branches,\r\nwhich is common to both species of _Ficus_, is regarded by the faithful\r\nBuddhists as the effect of a fear-instilling scene of which the sage was\r\nonce witness under the Bo-tree; just as the Syrian Christians deduce, from\r\nthe fact that the Holy Cross was manufactured out of aspen-wood, that this\r\ntree is trembling, even in our days, with anguish and terror. Singular,\r\nwhat an important part the fig-tree seems to play in all religions,\r\nincluding the Christian and the Mahometan!]\r\n\r\nThe grey-headed high-priest permitted the library of the temple to be\r\nshown to us, which consists of a large number of Pali manuscripts,\r\ninscribed on Talipot leaves, each of which was enclosed between two\r\nelegant boards made of calamander wood (_Diopyrus hirsuta_), fastened with\r\nstrings, and enveloped in numerous folds of cloth, the whole guarded with\r\nsingular reverence, in lofty, broad, wooden cupboards, richly carved. When\r\nwe returned, the chief priest requested us to give him our names, and that\r\nof the country we came from, upon which a young priest carefully wrote\r\ndown with a goose quill on a sheet of paper, in Cingalese language,\r\napparently with the view of showing us civility, some superficial remarks\r\nrespecting the _Novara_ Expedition.\r\n\r\nBesides the pure Cingalese, the island is also inhabited by Hindoos from\r\nthe Malabar coast, Moors (the descendants of wandering Arabs and\r\nMahometans from northern India, who at present carry on the greater part\r\nof the trade of the island), Malays, Javanese; then Portuguese, Dutch,\r\nBritish of the various nationalities comprised under that title; and,\r\nlastly, Negroes from Mozambique and Madagascar, who have formed alliances\r\nwith the Cingalese, and are rearing a numerous mixed race.[80]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: What is related by various writers of the practice of\r\n\"running a muck\" (a custom that seems to recall the frightful blood-feuds\r\nof the Corsicans), long supposed to be peculiar to Ceylon, in which a\r\nMalay thirsting for revenge, and armed with a naked \"_kreese_,\" or dagger,\r\nrushes through the streets like a madman, yelling \"_Amock, Amock_\" (kill,\r\nkill), and runs the fearful weapon through the body of the very first\r\nperson he meets,--seems to be founded on a mistake. No one could give us\r\nany particulars on the subject from personal observation. Sir Emerson\r\nTennant too, in his work on Ceylon, passes over this custom of \"running a\r\nmuck,\" without a syllable of mention. Evidently the custom is not\r\nnaturalized in this island. It now prevails among the Malays of the Sunda\r\narchipelago, while in Ceylon no instance has occurred within the memory of\r\nman. That this tendency to murder is caused by the use of opium likewise\r\nappears improbable. Crawford, in his most excellent descriptive dictionary\r\nof the Indian islands, speaking of \"running a muck,\" pretends it results\r\nfrequently from a monomania taking this particular form, and originating\r\nin disorders of the digestive organs.]\r\n\r\nDeep in the interior of the island, in the province of Bintang, N.E. from\r\nKandi, and towards Trincomalee and Batacalva, in holes in the earth, or\r\nunder the palm-leaves, reside the tribe of the Weddàhs or Veddàhs, the\r\nmost savage race in the island, traditionally said to be the aborigines\r\nproper, who go about naked, with the exception of a girdle round the\r\nloins, and use only bows and javelins, which however they manufacture and\r\nhandle with great dexterity.\r\n\r\nAccording to one of the various Cingalese traditions, these Weddàhs are\r\nthe descendants of a very bloodthirsty, cannibal monarch, who, deposed by\r\nhis people, was only permitted the alternative of death, or of\r\nwithdrawing with the ministers of his cruelty to roam for ever amid the\r\nsolitudes of the forest. The dethroned king chose the latter alternative,\r\nand thus became the little-to-be-envied progenitor of this rude savage\r\nrace. At any rate it seems worthy of note, that these Weddàhs, destitute\r\nthough they are of the remotest traces of civilization, are still regarded\r\nas belonging to the privileged caste.\r\n\r\nOwing to the shortness of our stay, we unfortunately had no opportunity of\r\nvisiting the interior of the island, or of seeing these Weddàhs. With\r\ndifficulty did we tear ourselves from the zone of the cocoa-nut growth,\r\nand therefore only got acquainted with two places on the island, Galle and\r\nColombo, the latter the seat of government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A HOUSE AT GALLE.]\r\n\r\nGalle is, from its position, as also from its configuration, indisputably\r\nthe best and most important harbour in the south and west of the island,\r\nas Colombo can only be regarded as an open, insecure roadstead. Founded in\r\nthe sixteenth century by the Portuguese, conquered at a later period by\r\nthe Dutch, and finally, at the peace of Amiens, transferred to the\r\nEnglish, Galle displays singularly few traces of its different masters.\r\nThe streets are narrow, but cleanly; the houses are for the most part\r\nconstructed of earth, with verandahs, or airy colonnades towards the\r\nstreet, and rooms within, plastered to imitate stone, of spacious\r\ndimensions, as is desirable, considering the heat of the climate. As one\r\nenters from the roadway at once into the sitting apartment, and as the\r\ndoor stands wide open all day to admit a free current of air, a sort of\r\nopen screen-work is usually put up before the entrance, to prevent a too\r\nminute inspection of the interior, by the prying eyes of inquisitive\r\npassers-by. At Galle we, for the first time, saw the \"Punkah,\" a sort of\r\nfan peculiar to India, which stretches from one end of the roof of the\r\nroom to the other, and being swung to and fro by a servant produces a\r\nrefreshing coolness. Here, too, we first became acquainted with the\r\n\"Gecko\" (_Hemidactylus maculatus_), an elegant little house-lizard, which,\r\nwith graceful agility, runs to and fro upon the walls, windows, and roofs,\r\nand speedily becomes as familiar with man as a pet-dog or kitten. They\r\nusually make their appearance towards evening, when, without the slightest\r\nsymptoms of timidity, they begin their surprising evolutions, during which\r\nthey catch gnats with astonishing dexterity, and although they are\r\ndisagreeable objects to all new comers, one speedily becomes accustomed to\r\nthese harmless, innocuous, playful little animals, of which the Ceylonese\r\nare in the habit of relating many interesting and amusing anecdotes.\r\n\r\nOf late years, during which Galle has risen into considerable importance,\r\nas the converging point of the lines of steamers to Eastern India, China,\r\nand Australia, the number of substantial houses has greatly increased, and\r\nseveral large hotels are found here replete with every comfort. Like most\r\nEuropean settlements in India, the Cape, and China, Galle possesses a fort\r\nin which, at an earlier period, the European colonists dwelt with their\r\nwives and families apart from the natives, and has also a \"Pettah,\" or\r\nBlack Town, a sort of Cingalese Ghetto, exclusively inhabited by the black\r\npopulation. At present this separation is not so strenuously enforced as\r\nin earlier times, but whoever would seek to form a more accurate idea of\r\nthe various races of this population, its mode of life and its demeanour,\r\nmust leave the so-called \"Fort,\" and wander through the native or\r\nCingalese quarter. Here are the fruit and vegetable markets; here all was\r\ndevoted to buying and selling, which seemed to excite the otherwise\r\nlistless little covetous disposition of the Cingalese; here jugglers and\r\nsnake-charmers exhibit, who excite interest rather by the horrible nature\r\nand the foolhardiness of the performances, than by their executing any\r\nsurprising feats. A belief is prevalent among the people that this\r\nsingular class of men, greatly resembling our own gipsies, possess the art\r\nof depriving a poisonous serpent of its venom, and rendering it\r\ninnocuous. And, in fact, one does see them produce from a white cloth the\r\ndreaded Cobra di Capello, 4 or 5 feet long, and exquisitely marked,\r\nirritate it violently, and go through all manner of unpleasant\r\nperformances with it on their naked bodies. Frequently the serpent, weary\r\nof being constantly brought out for exhibition, endeavours to escape from\r\nits tormentor, whereupon a general scramble for escape takes place among\r\nthe spectators. Every one hurries off to a safe distance, and the\r\nunfortunate charmer is left alone on the scene with his eminently\r\nintractable pupil, and has, into the bargain, given his exhibition in\r\nvain. As, however, it not unfrequently happens that the bite of the Cobra\r\ndi Capello is followed by fatal consequences to the snake-charmer himself,\r\nit is highly probable that the whole mystery resolves itself into courage,\r\nand the shrewdness with which, availing themselves of the uncommon dread\r\nand aversion with which this animal is regarded, they are able at once to\r\nprevent him from making use of his deadly poison fang, and to put forth\r\ntheir own sleight of hand. This explanation seems also to account for the\r\nvery remarkable fact that men have ventured to domesticate this dangerous\r\nreptile in more places than Ceylon. Indeed, within the experience of Major\r\nSkinner, a thoroughly trustworthy personage, who has resided for many\r\nyears on the island, and to whom the naturalists of the Expedition are\r\nindebted for many acts of kindness, an instance actually occurred in the\r\nneighbourhood of Negombo, in which a wealthy man, who keeps large sums of\r\nspecie in his house, bethought him of the singular precaution of having\r\nseveral deadly cobras to watch the treasure in lieu of dogs. Day and night\r\nthey glide about, a terror to thieves, while they are quite harmless to\r\nthe inmates who feed them and attend to them!\r\n\r\nIn former times snake worship (_Nagas_) was universal throughout Ceylon,\r\nand, as in India, the cobra received divine honours from the natives,\r\nbecause it was supposed to be a metamorphosed king. This serpent, however,\r\nis so singularly and wonderfully endowed by nature, its appearance and\r\nmotions are so peculiar, that an imaginative people like the Cingalese may\r\nwell be excused for associating the idea of metempsychosis with its aspect\r\nof mystery.\r\n\r\nFrom Galle, an excellent road, following the coast-line the entire\r\ndistance, leads to Colombo, the seat of government, 75 English miles\r\ndistant. Every morning there starts from Galle for that destination, the\r\n\"Royal Mail\" coach, an uncomfortable, somewhat dangerous, mode of\r\nconveyance, in which this distance is traversed in from 8 to 10 hours. In\r\norder to travel more at our ease, we engaged an extra waggon. In Ceylon\r\npeople usually employ, on long excursions, but one horse, which is changed\r\nat distances varying from 6 to 10 miles. We had some difficulty in\r\nreconciling this custom with our predilection for travelling at our\r\nleisure. The first few hours of our journey passed away very pleasantly;\r\nthe road was excellent, and the country magnificent and charming. We\r\nseemed as though driving through a park inhabited by thousands of men, and\r\nplanted with cocoa-nut palms--amidst which occasionally the white dome of\r\na Buddhist temple, or the minarets of a Mahometan mosque, shooting up\r\nabove the summits of the palms, imparted an aspect of life to the\r\nlandscape--while in the gay bazaars that fringed the road, the few\r\nnecessaries of life required by the exceedingly frugal natives were\r\nexposed for sale, temptingly arranged on palm or plantain leaves. The\r\nwhole south-western coast district is so populous that the huts of the\r\nnatives were continually in sight, right and left, under the forest shade,\r\nand the scenery in consequence seemed as full of life and careless\r\nenjoyment as though the people had nothing else to do but walk about under\r\npalm-trees. This impression was the more strengthened, that we rarely\r\nperceived a man with anything else in his hand than a Talipot leaf, or a\r\nChinese parasol, to protect himself against the burning rays of the sun,\r\nwhich shone almost directly overhead. Of the women, on whom for the most\r\npart fall all the troubles and hardships of life among the Cingalese, we\r\nonly saw a few carrying to the city heavy baskets balanced on their heads.\r\n\r\nThe luxuriant, widely-extending cocoa-nut forests, which on the south and\r\nwest sides of the island stretch down to the sea-shore (whereas on the\r\neastern coast they are altogether absent), seem independently of the\r\nnecessity of paying all due care to the maintenance of one of the\r\nnecessaries of life, to be specially indebted for their existence to the\r\ncircumstance that additional planting of this tree, as also its careful\r\ncultivation, is one of the religious observances and duties of the\r\nservants of Buddha. Whoever plants a cocoa-nut, palm, or bread-fruit tree,\r\nperforms a work agreeable to Buddha. At the birth of a son, or on any\r\nsimilar festive occasion, it is customary to plant a few cocoa-nut shoots\r\nin the earth. Cocoa-nut palms form a very important part of the property\r\nof a family. The father divides them as heritable property into equal\r\nportions for bequest to his children. Not one single palm but has an\r\nowner, though instances occasionally occur in which several families are\r\nsupported by the produce of a single palm!\r\n\r\nThis peculiar phenomenon has been followed by most remarkable results\r\nbearing upon the social condition of the native population. Increasing\r\npoverty, and the ever present grinding necessity of preventing any further\r\nsubdivision of the joint property, have impelled the natives to resort to\r\nthe unnatural remedy of the brothers of a family having but one wife among\r\nthem! The fact that there are in Ceylon fully one-tenth more men than\r\nwomen, was the cause of the rapid spread of this custom, and upheld\r\nPolyandria, or plurality of husbands, as a desirable invention for\r\nremedying the deficient supply of females. Many a female has three, four,\r\nor even seven husbands, and all children that are born of such a wedlock\r\nhave equal rights, and are (differing in this respect from the law of\r\nHindostan, by which only the children of the eldest brothers are\r\nregistered, as the entire property belongs to him, while all the younger\r\nbrothers serve him as vassals, and can be driven by him out of the house),\r\nthe _lawful_, recognized heirs of the different fathers. In order to guard\r\nagainst the rise of law-suits respecting birth and heritage among the\r\nCingalese, in consequence of their local customs, the British courts of\r\njustice, singular to say, find themselves constrained to recognize this\r\ndisgraceful custom, and to interpret the law with reference to it.\r\nAlthough in the maritime provinces plurality of husbands has been signally\r\non the decrease, owing to foreign influences, it still prevails to a great\r\nextent in the interior of the island. The submissiveness of the Cingalese\r\nto their superiors and their monarchs is assigned as the origin of this in\r\nother respects very ancient custom, which seems to have been universally\r\nin use among the various races of the mainland of India from time\r\nimmemorial. Constrained to apply their own manual labour in cultivating\r\nthe land of their tyrants, and frequently to accompany them on distant\r\njourneys, they thought they could, during their absence, most surely\r\nprotect their own fields and crops against utter ruin, by apportioning\r\nwife and chattels among brothers and nearest relatives, and thence the\r\nfamily tie was gradually converted into a socialist community.\r\n\r\nThe almost endless cocoa forests, which we were traversing by splendid,\r\nbroad, level roads, not alone provide the native with, to him, the most\r\nimportant necessary for supporting existence, but the fruit itself forms\r\nat the same time so important and valuable an article of produce, that the\r\ncultivation of the cocoa-nut has been regularly and systematically carried\r\non by European enterprise since 1841--at present covering an area of\r\n23,000 English acres--while the proportion of native land on which this,\r\nthe most useful growth of the tropics, is cultivated, amounts to about\r\n100,000 acres. Formerly, the nuts were shipped to foreign parts for the\r\nextraction of their oil; but for this purpose there are now on the island\r\nitself, especially in Colombo and Galle, a considerable number of\r\nmanufactories, at which the oil already expressed from the nuts is usually\r\nat once put into casks for exportation. The quantity of oil thus exported\r\nannually is estimated at from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 gallons, worth from\r\n£100,000 to £150,000. Besides this, the elastic fibre of the outer husk of\r\nthe cocoa-nut is used in the manufacture of ropes, door-mats, &c., and,\r\nunder the name of Coir, forms an important article of export, the annual\r\nconsumption averaging between 30,000 and 40,000 quintals (centner weight),\r\nworth from £20,000 to £25,000.\r\n\r\nThe first station on leaving Galle for Colombo is Bentotte, where, as is\r\nthe custom all through the country, there is a \"resting-house\" open to all\r\ntravellers, similar to the \"Choultries\" in India, the \"Caravanserais,\" or\r\nlodgings for pilgrims, in Eastern countries, or the \"Pasangrahans,\" of\r\nJava. These resting-houses, which all through the interior of the island\r\nare found on the highways and forest roads, are among the oldest\r\ninstitutions of the country, and were formerly maintained at the expense\r\nof private individuals. The resting-houses, which have been erected under\r\nthe English rule on the main roads of the island, are in all respects of a\r\nfar higher class, and strongly resemble the waiting-rooms of our own\r\n(German) railroads. One is not merely provided in these with shelter, but\r\nalso with food and drink, at a fixed tariff. A special committee (the\r\nProvincial Road Committee) is appointed to superintend the management of\r\nthese resting-houses.\r\n\r\nHere we partook of a luxurious \"tiffin,\" as the customary meal between\r\nbreakfast and dinner is called in Ceylon, as well as throughout India; and\r\nin so doing, made acquaintance for the first time with the renowned Indian\r\ndish \"Curry,\" which consists of flesh or fish prepared with a powder\r\ncompounded of spices. It tastes so hot that the European palate only gets\r\naccustomed to it by degrees; but in these countries it is looked on as the\r\nfavourite dish, which must never be absent from any meal, because the\r\ncayenne pepper plentifully sprinkled over it, stimulates the stomach and\r\npromotes digestion. Hence the curry-powder is in immense request, and is\r\nlargely exported. The assertion that this dish was first invented by the\r\nPortuguese is quite erroneous, as the chronicles of the country establish\r\nthat it was in request in Ceylon in the second century before Christ.[81]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: According to Professor Wilson, \"Curry\" is but a corruption of\r\nthe Carnatic term _Májkki-Kari_, a dish composed of rice, sour milk,\r\nspices, and red pepper.]\r\n\r\nAs we mounted into our vehicle again, after a short halt at Bentotte, in\r\norder to resume our journey to Colombo with a fresh horse, we perceived\r\nthat our driver, a negro, had been too free of his visits to the\r\nbrandy-bottle, and occasionally took to rolling on the box. In the hope\r\nthat he might become sober by the way, we ventured to proceed, but ere\r\nlong he lost his balance, and fell to the ground, compelling us, to avoid\r\nfurther mishap, to retrace our steps on foot to the nearest village--thus\r\nreversing the order of matters, and, so to speak, escorting our horse,\r\ncoach, and driver. This occurrence, unimportant and hardly worth\r\nmentioning in itself, was the occasion of an interesting adventure. As it\r\nwas only with much difficulty that we could make ourselves intelligible to\r\nthe natives, we resolved to apply to the authorities in the very first\r\nplace we came to. It turned out that we were in the vicinity of the\r\nCatholic mission of St. Sebastian de Makùn, whose superior was a\r\nBenedictine from Rome. The church is situated amid the rich vegetation of\r\nthe primeval forests, the gigantic trunks of whose trees, supporting a\r\nhuge diadem of luxuriant foliage, are arched into a natural dome of the\r\nmost graceful proportions. With curiosity whetted to the uttermost, we\r\nadvanced along a beautiful path, beneath cocoa-palms, cabbage trees,\r\nbread-fruit trees, screw pines, tree-like ferns, and broad-leaved bananas,\r\ntill we reached the dwelling-house of the Mission, and introduced\r\nourselves to the missionary. Forthwith the latter, a tall, stately figure,\r\nwith handsome features and cultivated manners, and dressed in a woollen\r\nrobe, ushered us into a darkened chamber opposite, and received us most\r\ncordially. This worthy priest, by the name of Miliani, was not less\r\nsurprised at being visited at this solitary mission by Austrian\r\ntravellers, and with the most lively satisfaction and the utmost readiness\r\nto oblige, offered us all the assistance in his power. In spite of our\r\nhurry, we had to take a cup of coffee _à la Romagna_, with our hospitable\r\nmissionary, and to promise to visit him on our return journey. Father\r\nMiliani has already lived many years in this country, and ministers to a\r\nChristian community of more than 1000 souls. Altogether there are in\r\nCeylon about 50 Catholic missionaries under a Bishop whose residence is in\r\nColombo. Our priestly host was greatly respected by the Cingalese, but he\r\nevidently was overjoyed at being able once more to express his thoughts\r\nand feelings in his native Italian.\r\n\r\nIt was evening ere, with many a hearty shake of the hand, we tore\r\nourselves away from the cordial hospitality of St. Sebastian de Makùn.\r\nHorse and driver this time gave hope of faster progress. But we were\r\ndoomed once more to experience a severe disappointment, and although we\r\nwere only about 10 or 12 miles distant from Colombo, which was our\r\ndestination, it took us five long hours to get over the ground. The night\r\nwas very dark, but the road was continually illuminated with torches of\r\npalm, carried by the homeward plodding natives, which emitted a gloomy\r\nlight alternating with showers of sparks.\r\n\r\nWhen at last we got to Colombo about midnight, pretty well knocked-up, we\r\ncomforted ourselves with the reflection that the inconveniences attending\r\npersonal transport between Galle and the seat of government, can by no\r\nmeans be classed among events of rare occurrence; since, in consequence of\r\nthe inveterate obstinacy of the native horse, one must have recourse to\r\nthe most incredible expedients to get the carriage under weigh. For\r\ninstance, at every station the ears of the post-horse were twisted\r\ntogether and then suddenly relaxed in order to set the vehicle in motion;\r\nand, when this torture failed, a pole, or thick stick, was inserted under\r\nthe tail of the recalcitrant, and rubbed up and down till the poor animal,\r\nsmarting under this painful operation, took to the collar. Once the\r\ncarriage is started in this extraordinary fashion, the coachman swings to\r\nand fro at the peril of his life, and endeavours by continually \"pitching\r\ninto\" the horse, to keep him at the gallop. Thus between whooping and\r\nwhipping the next station is reached, where the same trial of patience\r\nawaits the traveller, and a similar martyrdom for the next horse.\r\n\r\nOur first business the following morning was to take a walk through\r\nColombo, which, like Galle, consists of \"The Fort,\" or White City, and the\r\n\"Pettah,\" or Black Quarter, in the latter of which are situated the houses\r\nand shops of the natives, and where the chief traffic and the greatest\r\nactivity are combined. Here one rarely encounters a white man, for even\r\nthe soldiers and police belong to the brown and black races. The natives,\r\nhowever, manifest, outwardly at least, a great respect for the whites, and\r\neverywhere draw aside reverentially when one makes his appearance.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the main street are some Buddhist temples. We were not,\r\nhowever, permitted to enter, unless we consented to take off our shoes. At\r\nseveral of the natives' houses the entrance porch and windows were gaily\r\nadorned with plantain leaves. On inquiring of our Cingalese attendant what\r\nwas the occasion of this manifestation, he replied in broken English that\r\nthe inmates were celebrating \"Christmas,\" wishing probably to express that\r\nthe natives celebrated a feast analogous to our Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe filth and unsavoury odours which prevail in the Black Quarter, and the\r\nnoise and yelling of the natives, speedily drive visitors back to the\r\nEuropean portion of the city, which altogether, with its gloomy, decayed\r\naspect, makes anything but a favourable impression. The public buildings,\r\nthe houses of the mercantile community, the warehouses, and\r\nfortifications, all bear the impress of the Portuguese settlement of\r\nbygone centuries; and as its commerce is attracted more and more every\r\nyear to Galle,[82] there remains but faint hope that this quaint type will\r\nnot ere long be effaced by a new style of building, albeit the inhabitants\r\nof the capital promise themselves a restored reign of activity and energy,\r\nas the result of railway communication with Galle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: The value of the produce exported annually from the island\r\n(chiefly cocoa-nuts, coir, cinnamon, and coffee), is above £2,000,000, and\r\nthe imports of European manufactures are about the same amount.]\r\n\r\nDuring our random promenade through the streets of what is called the\r\nFort, we perceived at a sugar-baker's in Chatham Street--the most select\r\nquarter of Colombo, and containing the most important warehouses, which,\r\nhowever, are far from elegant in their appearance--some rough ice offered\r\nfor sale, which had a curious effect in a town so near the Equator, and\r\npresenting such few evidences of luxury in other respects. This ice is\r\nbrought round the Cape of Good Hope from the United States, and is chiefly\r\nshipped from Boston. The daily consumption of iced-water, ices, and so\r\nforth, is estimated at about 1000 lbs., costing about one shilling the 8\r\nlbs. It is impossible to repress a feeling of astonishment at these\r\nspeculative Yankees who, despite all obstacles interposed by temperature,\r\ntransport in all directions and over thousands of miles an article so\r\nperishable, so easily destructible as ice, and are able to drive a\r\nprofitable business in it in the hottest and most diverse regions of the\r\nglobe--in the West Indies and South America, in Asia, and in Africa.\r\n\r\nThe traveller who visits Colombo will hardly fail to make an excursion to\r\nthe Cinnamon Garden, in order to inhale the fragrant and peculiar aroma,\r\nand enjoy tasting the tender rind of this remarkable shrub, which plays so\r\nconspicuous a part in the history of Ceylon. During the palmy days of\r\ncinnamon culture, the five principal cinnamon plantations of the southern\r\nhalf of the island extended some 15 or 20 miles. For this one lucrative\r\nproduct of the soil all others on the island were abandoned, with most\r\ndeplorable consequences. The cinnamon culture, a monopoly of the various\r\ngovernments which one after another conquered Ceylon, and domineered over\r\nits inhabitants, was carried on, especially by the Dutch East India\r\nCompany, with terrible severity. The slightest embezzlement of cinnamon,\r\nor wilful damage to the plant, was visited with death. The unintentional\r\nbreaking off of a twig of the cinnamon bush was punished with amputation\r\nof the offending member. Every cinnamon bush, even to those growing in the\r\ngardens of private individuals, was the property of the Government, and\r\nthe cinnamon collector, or even cinnamon-peeler alone, had the right to\r\nstrip off the rind when ripe. To destroy such a plant, or even to dispose\r\nof it to any one, was regarded as a crime affecting life. The labourers,\r\nwho were employed in the cutting off, peeling, and preparation of the\r\nrind, belonged to the caste of Chalias, and constituted the lowest grade\r\nof that class. In like manner, under the English rule, the monopoly of\r\ncinnamon was at first continued, with such disastrous consequences to the\r\ntrade that it was finally abandoned in 1832, and the merchants of Colombo\r\nand Galle were left to divide among themselves the exportation of this\r\nimportant article, under an exporting duty of 3_s._ per lb. These duties,\r\nhowever, were found much too high, as the highest price obtainable in\r\nEurope was from 6_s._ to 7_s._; and this advance in the price to the trade\r\nof the genuine article, was the cause of foreign merchants turning their\r\nattention to the supply of various species of cinnamon-bearing laurels and\r\ncassias, growing in Cochin-China and Java.\r\n\r\nWhen Government, recovering at last from its delusion of treating\r\ncinnamons, which at first had seemed indigenous to the island of Ceylon\r\nalone on the earth,[83] as a national monopoly, reduced the export duty to\r\none shilling, and ultimately repealed it altogether, the various\r\nsubstitutes had already found their level in Europe, as affording a larger\r\nsupply at a much more moderate rate, and the cultivation of the finer\r\nkinds became less and less each year. Prices fell, and the consumption was\r\ndiminished. Only the coarser sorts repaid exportation. Nay, it even led to\r\nthe interesting and curious result, that just as, previous to the high\r\nprice under monopoly, the low-priced cassia displaced the finer sort of\r\ngenuine cinnamon, at the present day the coarser sorts of cinnamon are\r\nbeginning to oust the cassia from the English market, whence all the world\r\nare supplied. At present there are from 14,000 to 15,000 acres planted\r\nwith cinnamon, chiefly in private hands, and producing annually from\r\n800,000 to 900,000 lbs. of cinnamon, worth from £40,000 to £50,000\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Sir Emerson Tennent, in his work (vol. i. p. 599), challenges\r\nthe assertion that Ceylon is the native country of the cinnamon-tree. In\r\nno European or Asiatic chronicles is any mention made of cinnamon as a\r\nproduct or article of commerce in Ceylon up to the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. Although it was from the earliest times imported into Europe from\r\nAfrica through Arabia, the natives trading with Ceylon first knew of the\r\nexistence on the island of this important shrub about the twelfth or\r\nthirteenth century. Hence Sir Emerson looks upon Africa as the native\r\ncountry of the cinnamon-tree.]\r\n\r\nThe chalias, moreover, are no longer, as formerly under the Portuguese and\r\nDutch, _adscripti glebæ_ for life, or slaves that could be purchased with\r\nthe soil, but free labourers, who are entitled to demand proportionate pay\r\nfor the lightest services rendered.\r\n\r\nThe Cinnamon Gardens in the neighbourhood of Colombo, although for the\r\nmost part gone to decay, nevertheless impart to the whole scene a\r\nsingularly cheerful, agreeable aspect. The bushes, from 4 to 6 feet in\r\nheight, with their smooth, beautiful, light green leaves, resembling those\r\nof the bay-tree, and their pale, yellow flower-stamens shoot up doubly\r\nfresh and succulent, from the snow-white quartz soil in which they best\r\nthrive. The flowering season of the cinnamon is in January, and the fruit\r\nripens in April, when the sap is richest in the shrub. In May the boughs\r\nare begun to be \"barked,\" which process continues till October. The\r\npruning and gathering of the yearling shoots, which are about the\r\nthickness of a man's thumb, is very laborious, and employs many hands.\r\nEach labourer cuts off as many as he can conveniently carry in a bundle,\r\nthen, with the point of a crooked knife, made for the express purpose,\r\nstrips the entire rind from the wood, carefully scrapes off the exterior\r\ncorticle and innermost layer, and lays the stripped-off cinnamon rind, now\r\nreduced to the thickness of parchment, in the sun, where it dries and\r\ncurls together. All round the hut, in which the peeling of the rind is\r\ncarried on, is diffused a most exquisite aroma, caused by the breaking of\r\nthe leaves or twigs. What is related, however, by various travellers of\r\nthe fragrance of the cinnamon forests, which they have scented at a great\r\ndistance seaward, would seem to indicate that this delicious odour\r\nemanates from various other aromatic plants in which Ceylon is so rich,\r\nrather than the cinnamon groves, the aroma of which, indeed, is not\r\nperceptible beyond the immediate vicinity. The best description of\r\ncinnamon is not so thick as stout paper, and is fine-grained, flexible,\r\nlight brown, or golden yellow, sweet and pungent; the coarser qualities\r\nare thick-skinned, dark brown, acrid, stinging, and leaves a bitter\r\nafter-taste. In the warehouses, the cinnamon rinds and canes sorted for\r\nshipping are piled upon each other, packed in bales of about 90 lbs.\r\nweight each, and carefully sewed. In all cavities and spaces between each\r\nlayer an immense quantity of pepper is strewn, to preserve the cinnamon\r\nduring its sea-voyage, by which both spices are benefited, the black\r\npepper absorbing all the superfluous moisture, and gaining by the\r\nfragrance of the cinnamon.\r\n\r\nConsequent on the diminution of cinnamon cultivation, which undoubtedly\r\nhas resulted in great measure from the altered taste of mankind and the\r\nconsequent extraordinary falling off in the demand for this once\r\nhighly-prized spice, the cultivation of coffee in Ceylon has, during the\r\nlast 20 years, increased tenfold; and it is solely owing to the dearth of\r\navailable labour that this branch of produce, considering the splendid\r\nprofits it returns, is not even more extensively carried on. In 27\r\ndistricts there are 404 coffee plantations, covering a surface of 80,950\r\nacres, of which, however, only 63,771 acres are really productive. These\r\nproduced last year, 347,100 cwt., or 5-1/2 centners per acre. To this must\r\nbe added the quantity under cultivation by the natives, who possess about\r\n36,000 acres of coffee plantations, and in the year 1859 alone, exported\r\n180,000 cwt. We may safely assume, therefore, that the cultivation of\r\ncoffee is on the eve of transforming this island of Ceylon, from a mere\r\nmilitary station of England, into one of the most flourishing colonies of\r\nthe British Empire. Twenty years ago there were exported barely 60,000\r\ncentners, worth £180,000. In September, 1858, the export exceeded 600,000\r\ncwt., which represented on the spot a value of £1,500,000 sterling. \"When\r\ncapital and labour shall have become more plentiful,\" remarked to us a by\r\nno means over-sanguine resident, \"Ceylon will have in its mountain\r\ndistricts 240,000 acres planted with coffee trees, yielding at the lowest\r\nestimate, 1,680,000 cwt. of coffee annually.\" Here, as among the high\r\ntable-lands of Guatemala and Costa Rica, we have the reassuring evidence\r\nhow one of the most important plants for the civilized man can be\r\nprofitably cultivated, without having recourse to the blighting influences\r\nof slave-labour, at the same time making the lands in which it is produced\r\nboth rich and prosperous.[84]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: The coffee-tree frequently suffers, especially in Ceylon,\r\nfrom an insect called the coffee-bug (_Lecanium Coffeæ_); as, however,\r\nthis troublesome insect has only infested the coffee plantations since\r\n1848, and this branch of cultivation has nevertheless increased so\r\nsurprisingly since then, there seems no reason to dread that the coffee\r\nplant will suffer by these bugs, in the same manner or to the same extent\r\nas the vine by the ravages of the _fungus_.]\r\n\r\nWhile the cultivation of the coffee-plant has been followed by such\r\nsplendid results, the repeated attempts to introduce the sugar-cane have\r\nbeen on the contrary as uniformly failures--so that of the numerous\r\nplantations established by Europeans, there are at present no more than\r\nfive remaining. In all those localities where the temperature seemed\r\nadapted to the growth of the sugar-cane, the nature of the soil, and the\r\ntoo great humidity have prevented its thriving.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the island possesses two natural products in which but\r\nfew spots on the globe are qualified to enter the lists with her, and\r\nwhich may be expected to increase in value and importance in proportion as\r\nscience assumes her share in their exploration. These products are PEARLS\r\nand PRECIOUS STONES.\r\n\r\nThe most productive pearl banks lie on the west coast of Ceylon, between\r\nthe 8th and 9th degrees of North latitude, near the level, dreary beach of\r\nCondatchy, Aripo, and Manaar. The pearl fisheries are a monopoly, and,\r\ntherefore, under the inspection of the Government. Former governors had\r\ncounted too much on the abundance of this natural treasure, and in their\r\nblind haste to fill the coffers of the State, had so exhausted the banks,\r\nthat suddenly, from a source of revenue they became an item of\r\nconsiderable deficiency, and, from 1838 to 1854, could no longer be\r\ndredged. From a net annual return of £120,000 sterling, the yearly return\r\nhad sunk to £10,000, of which nearly one-half was consumed in the\r\nattendant expenses. Now-a-days the work is gone about more circumspectly,\r\na scientific examination having been made by a native naturalist, Dr.\r\nKelaart, of all the oyster banks on the west coast. We had the pleasure,\r\nwhile at Colombo, of becoming personally acquainted with this very able,\r\nunassuming gentleman, who presented us with several memoirs of his own,\r\ntouching upon the latest facts that had been ascertained with reference to\r\nthe pearl oyster. One special result of his various researches has been\r\nthe demonstration of two facts of the utmost importance to the pearl\r\nfishery, and which hitherto had not been fully ascertained--that this\r\nmollusc possesses locomotive powers; that its occasional disappearance is\r\nperfectly natural; and that, moreover, the pearl oyster may, without any\r\ninjury, be transplanted from one locality to another--nay, even from salt\r\nto brackish water. The first-named observation explains the occasional\r\ndisappearance of the pearl oyster from certain beds,[85] even when they\r\nhave not been inordinately thinned by too keen a quest after gain; the\r\nlatter opens up the pleasing anticipation of the pearl oyster being\r\nsusceptible of very extensive propagation, by a process similar to that of\r\npisciculture, or artificial breeding of fish (such as the colonies of\r\nedible oysters which are met with in the South of France), by\r\ntransplanting them to such places as seem best suited to the conditions\r\nnecessary to their highest development. What a splendid conception it were\r\nto plant the sea-coasts of Ceylon with pearls, and thus throw the wealth\r\nof the island in precious stones into the shade, by the treasures she\r\nwould possess in the depths of the sea!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: This singular property of the oyster, in virtue of which it\r\ncan be fed to as confirmed obesity as a prize-ox, and admits of nearly as\r\nmuch dexterity in \"crossing,\" if we are to trust the palates of\r\n\"gourmets,\" as the Southdown and Leicester breeds of sheep, has received\r\nits most extraordinary development in the vicinity of New York, where the\r\namount of capital sunk in the oyster trade considerably exceeds\r\n£1,000,000! The finest of these are transferred as spawn from the beds in\r\nthe East River, or Long Island Sound, to the \"nurseries,\" which are\r\nsituated in the brackish water near the head of the tide-way, just below\r\nthe \"Highlands of the Hudson.\" Here they are carefully tended for some\r\nmonths, till, their education being completed, they are re-transferred to\r\ntheir native beds, and fed there with oatmeal daily; while, by some\r\nmystery of the craft, the spawning season is postponed, except in the case\r\nof those that are selected for propagating the race.]\r\n\r\nExactly at the period of our arrival at Colombo, the preparations were\r\nbeing resumed at Aripo for the take of the oysters, which commences at the\r\nbeginning of February each year, and lasts about three weeks. It is, in\r\nfact, a sort of jubilee time for the people, at which the Governor and\r\nnumbers of the wealthier classes mingle with the populace. Ordinarily this\r\nspot becomes at that season a rendezvous for the poor and the wretched,\r\nand a rallying point for all manner of abominable odours, filth,\r\ntroublesome flies, and intolerable heat, despite which drawbacks the\r\nfishery is visited by thousands of boats, and hundreds of thousands of\r\nmen, who flock hither with the alluring prospect of speedy and abundant\r\nwealth, or have been attracted from all parts of the Indian Continent by\r\nthe singularity of the spectacle. Suddenly, as though evoked by the wand\r\nof a magician, a regular town starts into existence, of tents, or even\r\nneat huts, with bamboo and cabbage-tree palings, roofed over with\r\npalm-leaves, rice-straw, or coarse thick woollen cloth; booths for the\r\nsale of merchandise \"rise like an exhalation\" during the night to supply\r\nnecessaries of all sorts to the converging multitudes from the interior,\r\nas well as the fleets of visitors from seaward; and last, not least, the\r\ndivers themselves. Swindlers and mountebanks throng hither, adroit thieves\r\ncreep stealthily about, all Indian customs and fashions are represented,\r\nall castes jostle each other. Priests, and the subordinate hangers-on of\r\nthe various sects, hurry about, and jugglers and Nautch girls vie with\r\neach other in amusing the noisy multitudes.\r\n\r\nThe result of numerous experiments has proved that no diving apparatus can\r\nreplace the human machine, the cost of which, moreover, is a fixed\r\ndefinite quantity, viz., the fourth part of the pearls brought up, which\r\nis the diver's share. In each boat, or \"Dhonie,\" are ten divers, each\r\nhaving an assistant. Before the divers proceed to descend, a number of\r\nquaint ceremonies are gone through, and incantations murmured, as well in\r\nthe boats as on shore, by the so-called \"shark-charmers;\" indeed, the\r\nsuperstition of the divers, who for the most part come from the Coromandel\r\ncoast, is so great, that not one of their number, Christian or idolator,\r\nwould continue in this employment without the countenance of the sorcerer;\r\nand the Government finds itself compelled to pay the impostors.[86] They\r\nlevy a tribute of ten oysters upon each boat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: In 1857, the chief shark-charmer was a Roman Catholic!]\r\n\r\nAccidents with sharks are of rare occurrence: the noise of 1000 divers on\r\nthe water at once seeming to scare the animals. Moreover, the dark colour\r\nof the skin of their bodies, acts as a considerable protection to the\r\ndivers, so that there are numbers who blacken their legs, in order still\r\nmore to alarm the monster.[87]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: An encounter in the water between a shark and an expert\r\nswimmer, armed only with a knife, is not so unequal an affair as might at\r\nfirst be supposed. The pearl fishers of the Gulfs of Panama and Nicoya\r\nonly use a short stick, with which, if the sharks get _above_ them, they\r\nstir up the mud, under cover of which they swim along the bottom for a\r\nlittle distance, and then shoot up to the surface. Of the equality in\r\nwhich a good swimmer armed with a knife feels himself in encountering a\r\nshark, there are numerous instances. Many years ago, when shipping was\r\nmore plentiful in Kingston Harbour, Jamaica, than at the present day,\r\nvessels had occasionally to put up with somewhat awkward berths, when they\r\nused regularly to \"foul their anchors,\" whereupon it became necessary, of\r\ncourse, to send some one down to free the cable. For this purpose, negro\r\ndivers were employed, and one man attained a wide reputation from having\r\nhimself, unscathed, slain in fair combat at different times, no less than\r\nfive sharks! Ultimately the sharks steered clear of any black man who had\r\na knife suspended round his neck.]\r\n\r\nAfter these preliminaries, the divers go down into the water, each\r\ncarrying a basket-shaped net, in which to bring up the oysters, when\r\nselected--a stone of from 15lbs. to 25lbs. weight being fastened round the\r\nbody, so as more readily to enable him to sink to the bottom. When at a\r\ndepth of some 5 or 6 fathoms, the diver unfastens the stone, which is\r\nforthwith hauled up. He now throws himself forward on his face, and keeps\r\nhimself as close as he can to the ground, while he rapidly rakes up and\r\ncollects together all that is within his reach, so as to fill his landing\r\nnet. He crawls along in this manner during the minute of his submersion,\r\nover a space of from 40 to 50 feet; and so soon as he pulls the cord\r\nattached to his plaited basket-edge, it is immediately hauled up, and he\r\nhimself speedily follows it to the surface.[88]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: The divers are mostly old men, vigorous and healthy in\r\nappearance, thus dispelling the general notion that deep-sea diving\r\nweakens the body and shortens life. We were told of one diver, employed\r\nduring the year 1856, in the pearl fishery, who was so stout and fat, that\r\nin addition to the ordinary diver's stone, he had to make fast a\r\nconsiderable weight to his body, in order to sink himself in the water.]\r\n\r\nThe utmost depth at which the diver can safely remain seems to be about 40\r\nfeet, beyond which blood is apt to issue from the nose and ears. They\r\nseldom remain above 50 or 60 seconds under water, although cases\r\noccasionally occur in which the stay under water is protracted to 80\r\nseconds. The diving is carried on for 5 or 6 hours without intermission,\r\nso that each of the ten divers can, in the course of a day, bring up from\r\n1000 to 4000 oysters. By dint of good fortune, and close packing, about\r\n150 oysters are brought up in each basket-net, while occasionally an\r\nunprolific bed does not give more than five or ten oysters. So soon as the\r\noysters have been dragged to land, they are sorted in shares, of which one\r\ngoes to the oyster fisher as his remuneration, and the remainder are sold\r\nin lots of 1000 each to the highest bidder. Now begins speculation. Chance\r\npresides here, quite as capriciously as at a lottery or another game of\r\nhazard. It often happens that a single oyster contains thirty or forty\r\npearls, of which some may be worth a sovereign on the spot; but it more\r\nfrequently occurs that several hundred oysters do not yield a single\r\npearl. The small, valueless pearls, called also \"seed pearls,\" are burnt\r\ndown, and sold as pearl-lime to the wealthy Malays, by whom it is used as\r\na luxurious addition to the betel and cabbage nuts, as masticatories. The\r\nCeylonese mix the lustreless pearls with other grains, with which they\r\nfeed the poultry, in whose croops the pearls regain their former\r\nbrilliancy after a few minutes' grinding. The croop is then slit up, and\r\nthe glittering stones extracted, white as the most beautiful\r\npearl-muscular tissue.[89]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: This method of procedure, which is adopted by the rest of the\r\nIndian races, and in which the lustreless pearls are swallowed by hens,\r\npigeons, and ducks, so as to be polished up, after being subjected to the\r\npreliminary digestion of these birds, has been proved to be anything but\r\nbeneficial to the pearls as regards loss by attrition. Careful observation\r\nhas established, for example, that four pearls, weighing twelve grains,\r\nhave lost four grains by undergoing this process during twelve hours,\r\nwhile eight others, weighing thirty grains, were reduced to twenty grains\r\nafter a sojourn of two days in the gizzard of a duck.]\r\n\r\nThe pearl oysters caught on the coast of Ceylon are all of the same\r\nspecies (_Meleagrina Margaritifera_), uniformly oval in shape, and about\r\n9-1/2 inches in circumference. The number taken in Ceylon annually must be\r\nnumbered by millions. In the year of our arrival to Ceylon (1858), the\r\npearl fishery yielded £24,120. According to the last returns, before us as\r\nwe write, there were in the year 1859, 1352 boats engaged during eighteen\r\ndays in the pearl fishery, the gross take of which amounted to 9,534,951\r\noysters, sold for £48,216. The divers' shares amounted together to\r\n2,126,749 oysters.\r\n\r\nThe wide-spread popular delusion, that the pearl in the oyster is but a\r\nproduce of disease in the animal, has long been refuted by scientific\r\nresearch, and although the great German poet, Henry Heine, in his\r\n\"Romanzero,\" sings,\r\n\r\n   \"Those world-famed pearls,\r\n    They are but the wan mucus\r\n    Of a sad oyster,\r\n    Dimly sickening in the depth of the sea!\"\r\n\r\nit is rather a poetic fancy than a scientific fact. We have latterly been\r\nespecially indebted to the German naturalist, Theodore von Hessling, for a\r\nvery circumstantial and thoroughly exhaustive memoir on the natural\r\nhistory of the pearl oysters and their pearls,[90] in which the learned\r\nauthor seeks to establish that the enveloping matter of the germ of the\r\npearl is identical with the covering of the animal, and that in the\r\nprocess of growth two influences are at work, an external and an internal.\r\nThe first is called into play by the property peculiar to the hinge system\r\nthat unites the double shell, of gaping wide open, in consequence of which\r\nextraneous substances rush in with the current of water, such as minute\r\nfragments of quartz, molecules of plants, &c., which, being detained\r\neither circling in the cavity, or eddying round the hinges, are seized on\r\nin the course of their revolutions, and entangled in the parenchyma of the\r\nvarious organs, which is specially secreted from the mantle, till it\r\nbecomes enveloped by layers of solid shell. On the other hand, the\r\ninternal development is closely allied to the conditions of deposition\r\nand subsequent growth of the shell-matter. Molecules, either a single\r\ngrain or congeries of grains, varying from 9.01 to 0.05 of a line (3/4 of\r\nan inch down to the 1/240th of an inch), enclosed in the _epidermis_ of\r\nthe shell, constitute usually the _nuclei_ of the pearls, which, to a\r\ncertain extent, may be considered as nothing but a portion of the\r\n_epidermis_ not applied to the formation of shell. The pearls also are\r\nsimply independent concretions growing in the creature, and consisting of\r\nthe substance of the shell, which are with difficulty discriminated from\r\nthe various descriptions of growths which constitute the inner surface of\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Die Perlen-Muschel, und ihre Perlen, Naturwissenschaftlich\r\nund Geschichtlich mit Berücksichtigung der Perlen-gewässer Bayerns,\r\nbeschrieben von Theodor von Hessling, Leipzig, 1859.]\r\n\r\nThe great importance of the pearl as an article of luxury and commerce,\r\nhas naturally led to numerous attempts to manufacture them by artificial\r\nmeans, in the course of which extraneous bodies have been introduced\r\nbetween the mouth and shell of the animal, sometimes with, sometimes\r\nwithout injury to it. The Chinese especially are adepts at placing certain\r\nsmall bodies, specially prepared, in the shells of the pearl oyster,\r\nwhich, after a short time, becomes coated with mother-of-pearl, or nacre.\r\nThis manufacture of artificial pearls is carried on on a large scale in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Hong-Chow-Foo. During our stay at Hong-Kong and\r\nShanghai respectively, we ourselves saw several mussel-shells, in which a\r\nmother-of-pearl covering had formed over small neatly carved figures,\r\nmostly sitting figures of Buddha,[91] the singular appearance of which\r\nwould, at the first glance tend to make the observer suspect that the\r\npearl had been fastened to the mussel by some adhesive substance. But we\r\nhad so frequently an opportunity of satisfying ourselves by actually\r\nwitnessing the entire process, that we could no longer doubt that the\r\ncarved figures are with the utmost care introduced into the animal, and,\r\nafter remaining a few days in the water, become attached to the mussel by\r\na distinct membrane. This, their membrane, afterwards becomes\r\ninterpermeated by the calcareous matter, till, finally, layers of\r\nmother-of-pearl are deposited all around the nucleus, the whole formation\r\ncorresponding with the chalk-like concretions occurring in other\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: The antiquity of this experiment is proved by the fact that\r\nthe _Topographia_ of Ischikiang speaks of a pearl, which had been sent to\r\nthe Imperial Palace at Pekin, 490 B.C., which resembled Buddha, and\r\napparently must have been produced by this same method; although likewise\r\nthe priests of Buddha, at that early epoch, might not have objected, in\r\nthe interests of their religion, to make capital out of such a specimen of\r\nartistic skill.]\r\n\r\nBesides the pearl-shells, the northern shores of Ceylon, especially\r\nbetween the Island of Manaar and Karativoe, are especially rich in beds of\r\na volute mussel (_Turbinella rapa_, or _soluta gravis_), which are\r\nexported in great numbers to India, where the Hindoo women saw them into\r\nrings of all sizes, to be worn as ornaments on the arms, legs, fingers and\r\ntoes. The chank-shell is likewise a chief instrument of the Buddhists,\r\nwho, amongst other devout customs, blow three times a day on this sacred\r\nshell, to summon believers to worship.[92] It is also used as a festive\r\nornament of the Indian temples, as well as a donation to the dead, which,\r\ninspired by a religious feeling, the survivors place in the grave\r\nalongside of the corpse of their illustrious departed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: According to the most ancient annals of the Cingalese, the\r\nchank-shell is sounded in one of the superior heavens of the demigods\r\n(similar to the conk-blowing Tritons of Grecian mythology), in honour of\r\nBuddha, as often as the latter wanders abroad on the earth.]\r\n\r\nThe gems found on the island are distinguished, less for their intrinsic\r\nvalue than for the great variety of precious stones which are present.\r\nThey are, with few exceptions, found to have been disengaged from the\r\nprimitive rocks, and washed into the alluvial soil, especially in the\r\noutskirts of the mountainous districts, where they are rolled along the\r\nbeds of the streams together with other pebbles, or are washed out of the\r\nalluvial deposits. Hitherto, they have only been searched for for purposes\r\nof trade, and then only in the most desultory and thriftless way, no one\r\nhaving as yet examined the rocks themselves, by the disintegration of\r\nwhich the valuable stones are disengaged. There was, indeed, no detailed\r\ninformation as to the wealth in precious stones of the island, until the\r\nresearches of the English mineralogist, Dr. Gygax, who has very lately\r\npublished on this subject many interesting observations and remarks. The\r\nlocality in which precious stones are most abundant is, so far as present\r\nexperience goes, the district of Saffragam, the capital of which in\r\nconsequence takes the name of Ratnapoora, or Anarhadnaporra, \"the city of\r\nrubies.\" They are also found at various other parts of the island; in the\r\nplains on the West coast, between Adams' Peak and the sea, at Nuwera\r\nEllia, Kandy, Matelle, and Ruanwelli, near Colombo, as also in Matura, and\r\nthe river courses on the eastern side, towards the ancient Mahagam. The\r\ngeologist of the Expedition visited some mines of precious stones near\r\nRatnapoora. These are situated on the Kaluga-Sella, a small tributary of\r\nthe Kalu-Gunga, and lie, some in the very bed of the river, some on the\r\nsteep bank. They are about thirty feet deep, but having been some time\r\ndisused, they are full of water. The uppermost stratum of these pits or\r\nmines is a rich fertile yellow loam, exactly resembling our diluvial\r\nloams. This is succeeded, according to the report of the proprietor of the\r\nmines, by a slimy black clay, and clayey sand, beneath which again is a\r\nbituminous clay, holding numerous organic remains, such as leaves, trunks\r\nof trees converted into a substance resembling lignite, and not\r\ninfrequently elephants' tusks and bones of animals; thereafter sand, and\r\nlastly a bank of rolled gravel, forming a species of conglomerate with\r\nred, yellow, and occasionally blue clay--being, in fact, what is known as\r\nstone-gravel. This bank of pebbles is the layer in which the precious\r\nstones occur, and these are most commonly found between the larger masses\r\nof agglutinated matter, that are always found especially to abound in\r\ngems, whenever they are superposed upon what is called malave, which\r\nappears to be a sort of greenish-coloured talc-like half-decomposed mica.\r\nThe most valuable stones that are obtained from these mines are rubies and\r\nsapphires. In the Kalu-Gunga, also, precious stones are occasionally\r\nwashed down, and as the geologist of the _Novara_ Expedition was\r\ndescending the river in a boat, from Ratnapoora to Caltura, he perceived\r\nat several places, more particularly at the various rapids, men standing\r\nin the water, provided with flat pan-shaped baskets, in which they sifted\r\nthe sand and pebbles.\r\n\r\nThe gems found on the island are rubies, sapphires topazes, amethysts,\r\ngarnets, cinnamon-stone, and tourmaline. On the other hand, all the\r\ndiamonds, emeralds, carnelians, agates, opals, and turquoises, which the\r\nnatives offer for sale, are imported from India. One precious stone, on\r\nwhich the Cingalese set an exceedingly high value, because they\r\nerroneously believe that it is peculiar to the island of Ceylon, whereas\r\nit is also found on the southern shores of Hindostan, is the \"Cat's-eye,\"\r\na greenish transparent quartz, which, when polished in its natural shape,\r\nor \"_en cabochon_,\" exhibits in its interior a varying reflected light,\r\nundoubtedly arising from the presence of fibres of asbestos, and which, in\r\nfact, bears some resemblance to the eye of a cat. The natives, as a rule,\r\nestimate the value and symmetry of this stone by the brilliancy and\r\ntenuity of the beam which it emits, and the clear olive-coloured ground\r\nupon which it shines in relief.\r\n\r\nA vast number of men give themselves up to the exciting but most uncertain\r\noccupation of searching for precious stones, and barter what they have\r\nfound, chiefly to Mahometan merchants, for clothes and salt. As, however,\r\nthe natives themselves set a high value on jewels, in consequence of\r\ntheir small bulk admitting of their being readily concealed and easily\r\ncarried about, the finer descriptions are readily disposed of at a good\r\nprice, and, singular to say, it has frequently happened, as we ourselves\r\nfound by personal experience, that precious stones are dearer in Colombo\r\nand Galle than in the European markets! The explanation of this paradox is\r\nprobably that the steady copious influx into the London and Paris markets\r\nof precious stones from all parts of the earth where jewels are found,\r\nadmits of by no means such excessive fluctuations in value as at Ceylon,\r\nwhere the supply actually on hand is so varying, and where the value of\r\nthe article almost always depends upon the rank and wealth of the Indian\r\npurchaser. The foreign traveller very often cannot restrain a feeling of\r\nsurprise at seeing the fingers of the stately Mahometan jewellers adorned\r\nwith rings of costly gems, which are only offered for sale to himself at\r\nan exorbitant sum.\r\n\r\nThe value of the precious stones of all sorts found in Ceylon in the\r\ncourse of a year is estimated by Sir Emerson Tennent at about £10,000,\r\none-fourth, at least, of the entire quantity finding a market on the\r\nisland, a full half being sent to the jewel-polishers of India, so that\r\nonly the remaining fourth is exported to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe scant time allotted to us at Colombo was zealously occupied in seeing\r\nthe utmost that we could of the many interesting objects that invited\r\nattention. Among others, we visited one of the largest industrial\r\nenterprises in Ceylon, known as Hultsdorf Mill, a cocoa-nut-oil factory,\r\nthe proprietorship consisting in shares, of which the largest holder is\r\nDavid Wilson, Esq., the Austrian Consular Agent. Here are carried on all\r\nthe various processes connected with the manufacture, the preparation of\r\nthe oil-cake from the cocoa-nut, the expressure of the oil, &c., which are\r\ncarried on by apparatus, partly sent out from England, partly put up in\r\nthis country, all set in motion by steam-engines. The task assigned in\r\nthese factories to the natives, of whom above a thousand are employed in\r\nthe various departments, is, nevertheless, not the less important and\r\nsignificant, that, while machinery is used in those processes where it is\r\nnecessary to use an agency far transcending the powers of mere human\r\nlabour, all collateral products, such as soap, candles, perfumery, as also\r\nthe implements and tools required for the works, and even the barrels and\r\nchests required for the transport of the manufactures, are prepared and\r\nused by handicraft labour.\r\n\r\nTo the thoughtful visitor it is a scene of no ordinary interest to behold\r\nseveral hundreds of Cingalese, Hindoos, and Mozambique negroes, all\r\nthoroughly conversant with the management of the most magnificent\r\ninvention of the nineteenth century. Here are a number of artisans\r\nemployed at the hydraulic presses and iron turning-lathes; in another\r\napartment the various parts of the different machines are being\r\nconstructed or put together, which regulate the pressure of the steam\r\nsupplied to the apparatus when in activity; in a third, persons are busy\r\nexamining and testing the resulting products with scrupulous precision.\r\nWith all its development, European industry has, in this quarter,\r\nexercised but an obscure influence; and, thus far, has been productive of\r\nbut small results as a civilizing element among this population, which has\r\nhitherto shown itself so little disposed to accept the Christian form of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIn the large warehouse belonging to Mr. Wilson, we also saw huge heaps of\r\n\"Kauris,\" or Cowries, (_cypræa moneta_), the renowned, or rather\r\nill-reputed, species of mussel, which comes from the Maldive Islands, and\r\nplays so important a part in the commerce with the coast of Malabar and\r\nthe interior of Africa; while here, it constitutes the sole medium of\r\nexchange, which is used by way of barter for almost all sorts of\r\nagricultural produce, chiefly among the blacks.[93] These mussels are sent\r\nfrom Ceylon to London, and thence back to the Eastern Coast of Africa, and\r\nthus indirectly uphold the slave-trade, as, the native merchants of that\r\nregion barter these shells, so greatly sought after by all African tribes,\r\nas ornament, for negroes and negresses, who are in turn sold to the\r\n\"speculators in human flesh.\" A ton of these shells, of which the smaller\r\ndescription are most in request, and therefore the most valuable, costs\r\nin Ceylon about £70 to £75.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: The Malay name for this mussel is \"beya,\" implying duty,\r\ntoll, tax, thus leaving it open to conjecture that that nation, in their\r\ncommerce with the Asiatic and African continents, have for untold ages\r\nemployed the same principles of currency and expressions of value as\r\nourselves.]\r\n\r\nTo the kindness and active interest in our objects of Mr. Wilson, in whose\r\nagreeable villa at Mootwall--the plan and method of construction of which\r\nreminded us of the beautiful planters' houses on the sugar estates of\r\nLouisiana--we spent the last night of our stay at Colombo, we are also\r\nindebted for a copy, with which he presented us, of the most ancient\r\nannals of Ceylon, inscribed with an iron graver upon Talipot palm-leaves\r\nin the highly-esteemed Pali language, and preserved between richly-carved\r\nboards of the costly wood of the Kalamander tree (_Diospyrus Hirsuta_).\r\nThis carefully-preserved MS. includes, among others, the celebrated epic\r\npoem \"Mahawanso,\" (an abbreviation \"Mahantaman Wanso,\" \"Genealogy of\r\nmighty men,\") which recites under 100 heads, and in 9175 verses, the most\r\nimportant events connected with the interior constitution and history of\r\nthe island, as also of all the battles fought by the inhabitants in\r\nforeign countries from B.C. 543 to the year 1758, A.D. Of these, the most\r\nrenowned historic relics of the Cingalese, 38 chapters, of 262 pages 4to,\r\nwere translated into English by George Tumour, Esq., an eminent Pali\r\nscholar, and printed at Ceylon, in the year 1837. Unfortunately, his\r\nearnest desire to publish the rest of this highly-interesting work was\r\ndestined not to be gratified. The grave closed over him ere he could\r\nrealize his wish. At present, however, there is a prospect of the\r\ntranslation of the \"Mahawanso\" being completed by Mr. James de Alwis, a\r\nworthy follower in the footsteps of Mr. Turnour, chiefly through the\r\nmunificence of Government and of the Scientific Institutes, which were\r\ninvoked to supply the requisite assistance for the prosecution of an\r\nundertaking likely to prove so unremunerative.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the copy of the \"Mahawanso,\" we also procured a number of\r\nother important Cingalese MSS. on Talipot palms, which were made use of by\r\nTumour, partly in his translation of the \"Mahawanso,\" partly in his other\r\nworks upon Ceylon, and which embrace numerous valuable historical details\r\nnot comprised in the \"Mahawanso.\" This complete collection of the most\r\nantique annals of the Island of Ceylon, in the purchase of which we were\r\nkindly favoured with the advice and assistance of Mr. Wilson at Colombo,\r\ntogether with a variety of other Cingalese MSS. on palm leaves, collected\r\nat a subsequent date, now form part of the collection of valuable books in\r\nthe Imperial Royal Library at Vienna.\r\n\r\nBesides Mr. Wilson, our very best thanks are due to the Colonial\r\nSecretary, Sir C. J. McCarthy, who had the kindness to provide several of\r\nthe members of the _Novara_ Expedition with the requisite letters of\r\nintroduction to the authorities in the interior of the Island: also to Mr.\r\nJohn Selby, the very obliging proprietor of the _Examiner_; to Dr.\r\nKelaart, physician and naturalist; to Charles P. Layard, Esq., the\r\nGovernment Agent for the Western Provinces; and to Captain Gosset,\r\nSurveyor-General, for their numerous attentions. The last-mentioned\r\ngentleman very kindly provided us with a pair of level-tubes which we\r\nurgently needed for one of our levelling instruments, and which, in this\r\nquarter of the globe, were more rare and difficult to be met with than\r\npearls or precious stones.\r\n\r\nOur return from Colombo to Galle, was not less marked by misadventures\r\nthan our journey thither. As far as Caltura, where our amiable Father\r\nMiliani was in waiting for us with his neat single-horse equipage, to\r\nconvey us to the beautiful parsonage of St. Sebastian Makùn, all went\r\ntolerably smoothly with us. We arrived, as had been concerted, to\r\nbreakfast with this hospitable shepherd of souls. On our way to the\r\nparsonage, we noticed that great respect was paid to the worthy Father, by\r\nsuch of the Cingalese as met us. Their usual salutation was to bend\r\nthemselves to the earth, veiling their eyes at the same time, and bending\r\nforward the outstretched head as though to implore a blessing. Father\r\nMiliani, who held the reins in his left hand, while his right hand\r\nflourished a long heavy whip, slightly inclined his body upon the\r\ncabriolet, and so dismissed in peace the poor folk that besought his\r\nbenediction. When we had now got pretty near the parsonage, we were\r\nsuddenly brought to a halt by a couple of natives, of whom one implored\r\nthe spiritual ministration of the Father for his wife, then lying almost\r\n_in articulo mortis_, while the other had brought with him, from the\r\nsacristy of Makùn, the Communion-plate required for the purpose. The\r\npriest, to whom this interruption seemed to come as a matter of course,\r\nstopped, apologized for the unexpected delay, threw the reins to one of\r\nthe party, sprang from the waggon, and disappeared in the gloom of the\r\nforest. It was not for long, as it proved; for the stately, handsome\r\nfigure of the priest of Makùn presently appeared between the cocoa-palms.\r\nHe had found the woman much less dangerously ill than he had been led to\r\nexpect by the report of the husband, the native converts to Christianity\r\nbeing very much given to requesting the administration of the rites of the\r\nChurch, upon being attacked by the slightest indisposition, because they\r\nanticipate much more benefit from spiritual treatment than from the\r\nmedicines of their body-curers. And now we proceeded on our way to the\r\nparsonage at a smart gallop, which, however, did not prevent a zealous,\r\nmuch-believing Cingalese from keeping up with the mettled horse, stride\r\nfor stride, for the entire distance, keeping close to the waggon as he ran\r\nalongside. We were not then aware, indeed, whether this violent bodily\r\nexercise was undertaken as a matter of choice or as a penance, but it\r\nseemed to us, in any case, an act far less meritorious than prejudicial to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nIn St. Sebastian de Makùn, the entire community were awaiting our arrival,\r\nand escorted us by a romantic hill, and through a delicious palm-forest,\r\nto the priest's abode. Here we found the porch of the house gaily adorned,\r\nand metamorphosed with tropical fruits and flowers into a smiling fragrant\r\nbower, with the feathery leaf of the cocoa-palm cut into thin strips. The\r\ninventive ingenuity of the Cingalese had endeavoured to represent the\r\nvarious birds found in tropical forests, which were suspended in\r\nornamental baskets of green leaves among the festoons. Over the entrance\r\nto this bower, improvised out of materials supplied by the primeval\r\nforest, was placed a picture painted by the good Father himself,\r\nrepresenting a large anchor, with the superscription in Italian \"La\r\nsperanza non confunde!\" (Hope never disappoints!) This was evidently a\r\ndelicate allusion of our kind-souled entertainer to the hope which he had\r\nexpressed during our previous visit, that he should see us on our return\r\nfrom Colombo, \"which had not been disappointed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the arbour appeared an elegantly appointed table, that\r\nseemed ready to give way under the weight of good things spread upon it,\r\naround which were placed a number of arm-chairs, worked in tapestry, while\r\nthe plastered floor was strewed with the glistening green leaves of the\r\n_Ficus religiosa_. As soon as we had taken our seats, the members of the\r\ncommunity, consisting of more than a hundred tawny, half-naked Cingalese\r\n(principally men and children), arranged themselves in a circle, and some\r\nhalf-dozen dancers began to execute a very ordinary-looking dance to the\r\nsound of a drum. The entire figure consisted in their simply approaching\r\neach other from opposite sides, during which they struck the\r\nhollow-sounding instrument pretty sharply, holding it in their hand the\r\nwhile, after which they drew away from each other, and wound up by\r\ndancing round in a circle in couples. A boy of eight, in glittering\r\ncostume, next performed a dance, in which he was accompanied by a grown-up\r\nCingalese who sung, occasionally accompanied by drum and fife. Frequently\r\nwe enquired what was the meaning of the vocal accompaniment to the dance,\r\nbut could get no information upon the subject. But we have always had\r\noccasion to remark among the various primitive races, that they are rarely\r\nable to give any connected account of the history of their dances or even\r\ntheir songs, but simply go through a set of mechanical figures which they\r\nhave learned, or rehearse a set of words by rote, without being able to\r\nassign any signification to either. Over and over again have we put the\r\nquestion, only to receive the same stereotyped answer from Hindoos,\r\nNegroes, Chinese, Malays, and Polynesians, that they could tell us nothing\r\nmore than that these songs and dances took their origin in the \"olden\r\ntimes.\" Breakfast was served in the arbour by Cingalese boys. As often as\r\nthe hospitable Father turned to apologize for his scanty means, which\r\nprevented him from ministering to our entertainment as he could wish, some\r\nnew dish would be forthcoming, or some fresh kind of wine would be\r\nproduced, till one knew not which most to admire, the variety of the\r\nentertainment, or its cost in preparation.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring of Father Miliani, in the course of conversation, whether he\r\nhad any acquaintance with the plants to which the natives ascribe healing\r\nproperties, he sent for a phial containing an oily substance, which;\r\naccording to the Cingalese herbalists, is composed of 57 different roots\r\nand as many flowers, and has already been wonderfully efficacious in cases\r\nof persons bitten by poisonous serpents. It is called by the natives,\r\n_Visanili-Katail_ (oil against poison); and the priest of Makùn remarked\r\nto us, he had himself had an opportunity of satisfying himself as to the\r\nmarvellous curative qualities of this vegetable substance, in the case of\r\npersons who had been bitten by the most venomous snake in the whole\r\nisland, the _Cobra di Capello_, who had entirely recovered by the copious\r\nuse of this antidote. The application is very simple. The mouth is rinsed\r\nout with it, and the patient further takes from 15 to 20 drops of the oil\r\ninternally. Unfortunately, we were not able to inquire more particularly\r\nas to the ingredients from which the Visanili-Katail is compounded, of\r\nwhich we eventually got a small quantity to carry away with us, after much\r\nentreaty; but by way of compensation, Father Miliani was able to give us\r\nmuch valuable information as to the manners, customs, and traditions of\r\nhis flock. He regretted, however, that they were all of a highly\r\nimpassioned strain, and that they constantly passed from one extreme to\r\nthe other. The following trait, which was pointed out to us by the Father\r\nin the course of conversation, may serve to indicate the modes of thought\r\nand observation of the natives. When the Cingalese perceived how eagerly\r\nand with what warmth of friendship the Father received us, they inquired\r\nof him whether he had been previously an acquaintance of ours, as they\r\nwere unable to conceive the existence of such hearty good-will between\r\npersons who were utter strangers to each other. The priest, readily\r\nappreciating the results which must flow from the reply he should give, in\r\nconfirming the devout souls of his children, replied that the reputation\r\nof his name had long since penetrated to us, and we were unwilling to ride\r\nby without turning aside to salute him, to which he had readily expressed\r\nhis assent, and had also long since been apprized of the important mission\r\nof the Austrian ship of war, whose commander was termed by the natives,\r\nwith the bombast of their native tongue, \"King of the Sea.\" At our\r\ndeparture, the kind Father presented us with several interesting articles,\r\nas _souvenirs_ of Makùn, while we, on our part, left with him a donation\r\nin money to defray the expenses of erecting his church.\r\n\r\nFather Miliani, the band of musicians, consisting of ten or twelve\r\nwild-looking fellows, with all manner of barbarous musical instruments, of\r\nwhich they made not less barbarous use, together with a laughing, yelling,\r\ngesticulating crowd of half-naked Cingalese, with long raven locks\r\nfloating over their shoulders, accompanied us to our travelling chariot.\r\nHere we took leave of the hospitable Father, the vehicle set out on its\r\nroute, and the whole brown retinue at once dispersed.\r\n\r\nHardly had we left the Mission of St. Sebastian Makùn behind us, ere our\r\ntroubles began afresh. At almost the very first station we came to, we\r\nhad to hire a horse from a resident at an exorbitant rate--the animal\r\nbelonging to the station, and which had been engaged for us, being utterly\r\nuseless. This gave occasion for fresh delays. The party letting the horses\r\nwas what is called a native doctor, who assumed the title of \"native\r\nvaccinator,\" and bitterly complained, that for his attendance four days in\r\nevery week, as required by the law, for the purpose of inoculation, he\r\nonly received from Government a monthly salary of £2 5_s._ sterling.\r\nWhatever deficiency existed in his salary, he seemed determined to make up\r\nfor in the hire of his horse, which he charged for at the rate of ten\r\nshillings for six miles! On the cash being forthcoming, our \"native\r\nvaccinator\" did not disdain himself to take the reins, and, with his own\r\nhands, apply the whip to his mare between the shafts of our vehicle. But\r\nthis mark of distinction was destined, ere long, to cost us dear. Hardly\r\nhad we proceeded a couple of miles under his care, when the hind-wheels of\r\nthe vehicle sunk into a rut, whence our Æsculapian steed lacked the\r\nstrength to extricate us. To complete the sum of our misfortunes, at the\r\nvery moment we were using our utmost endeavours to replace the waggon on\r\nthe regular track, it came on to rain heavily, and we were, in a\r\ntwinkling, wet to the skin. Some thirty young Cingalese, in the full dress\r\nof Adam before the Fall, who were standing open-mouthed round the waggon,\r\ncould only be roused by threats from their passive attitude; and when,\r\nfinally, they lent a hand to assist, they, in their ill-timed zeal, came\r\nnear oversetting the waggon into the ditch on the opposite side. Next, we\r\nexchanged this stubborn brute for one that was blind. For a brief space we\r\nhoped the latter might probably be the more easily driven in consequence\r\nof his not seeing what was going on around him; but these anticipations\r\nwere speedily dispelled, and in a rather unpleasant manner. The short\r\ndistance that now separated us from our destination seemed as though it\r\nwould never have an end; and, in a word, it was already verging on\r\nmidnight ere we reached Galle, where we had been expected to dinner five\r\nhours before, by our hospitable friend, the Consul for Hamburg. Some of\r\nthe invited guests had already left this agreeable house, while others\r\nwere still seated at the whist-table, as, wearied and exhausted, we\r\nentered the drawing-room. The circumstances that had so seriously delayed\r\nour arrival were explained by way of apology, and proved the subject of\r\nsome goodnatured quizzing on our misfortunes by the guests present; and in\r\nsuch agreeable society, and over a sumptuous supper, we speedily forgot\r\nthe trifling annoyances of our latest experiences.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a desultory agreeable conversation about the natural\r\nbeauties of the island, many were the plans of more distant excursions\r\nwhich we projected this evening--which, however, upon more mature\r\nconsideration, all proved impracticable, owing to the scanty time at our\r\ndisposal. Thus we found ourselves, much against our wishes, compelled to\r\nforego a visit to Kandy, and its beautiful environs, in which is situated\r\nthe renowned temple that enshrines the tooth of Buddha, the occupation of\r\nwhich by the English was, in the eyes of the Cingalese, the most manifest\r\nindication of their being the legitimate conquerors of the kingdom.[94]\r\nNeither were we able to take part in an elephant hunt, although these\r\nanimals are found in the island in such quantities, that it is related,\r\nwith every appearance of accuracy, of a single elephant hunter, the late\r\nMajor Rodgers, who was struck dead by a flash of lightning a few years\r\nsince in the midst of the forest, that he had, in the course of his life\r\nof active exercise, laid low fifteen hundred elephants with his own hand!\r\nBut permission was granted by the commander of the Expedition to the\r\ngeologist and one of the zoologists to remain in Ceylon, and rejoin the\r\nfrigate at Madras by the steamer which runs fortnightly, so as to enable\r\nthem to ascend the world-famous Adam's Peak, 7000 feet high, one of the\r\nloftiest peaks in Ceylon, where, according to tradition, the founder of\r\nthe Buddhist doctrine, when last he visited the earth, in answer to the\r\nsupplications of a priest, left behind the print of his footstep\r\n(_Sri-pada_), as a visible sign of his presence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: The legend relating to these relics, about which so many wars\r\nwere waged, goes back as far as the third century of the Christian era,\r\nwhen Mahasana, a true believer, having become King of Ceylon, purchased\r\nthese teeth for numerous valuable presents, of one of his kindred, a\r\nCalinga king in Bengal, who sent them over by his princes. The tooth\r\nDahata Wahansa immediately achieved a miracle--it illumined the entire\r\nisland, and supplanted all heretical teaching. It was forthwith enveloped\r\nin a hundred cloths, and a temple erected to enshrine it, since which it\r\nhas been regarded as the Palladium of Ceylon. When, in 1560, this tooth\r\nwas transferred to the temple at Manaar by the Portuguese under Constantin\r\nde Braganza, the king offered the Portuguese bigots 600,000 pieces of gold\r\nby way of ransom. Braganza judged it more advisable to destroy the tooth.\r\nBut he little knew the adroitness and subtlety of the Buddhist priesthood.\r\nThe very next morning the tooth, that had been supposed to be destroyed\r\nwas marvellously found in a Lotos leaf in the temple, where it had been\r\ndeposited by Buddha himself!]\r\n\r\nWe cite, in the following extract, the most prominent features of this\r\nventure, as supplied by the two members of the Expedition who undertook\r\nit, so as to complete the description of the _Novara's_ visit to Ceylon:--\r\n\r\n\"On 13th January, 1858, we proceeded from Colombo to Ratnapoora, _en\r\nroute_, to visit Adam's Peak, a tolerably long and tedious journey. On the\r\nmargin of a river we encountered an elephant, who was engaged in assisting\r\nthe labourers on the public roads in that vicinity. While our car and the\r\nbaggage were being embarked here, and again put in order, this animal went\r\nthrough a number of tricks, such as swaying to and fro, lying down,\r\nraising his trunk, and trumpeting, the latter of which, at a sign from his\r\ndriver, he did with a vengeance, and for so doing was rewarded with a few\r\nplantains. These exercises seem to constitute the first steps in taming,\r\nas they were gone through in a similar manner by all the elephants we\r\nafterwards saw, whether employed like this one in task-work, or maintained\r\nfor show, or made use of in the Temple service.\r\n\r\nAt mid-day we reached Ratnapoora, and as we were anxious to shorten as\r\nmuch as possible our next day's journey, we decided on pushing forward in\r\nthe course of the afternoon, as far as the little village of Gilli-Mali,\r\nseven miles further on. We had been provided by C. W. Layard, Esq., the\r\nGovernment Agent in Colombo, with letters of introduction to his deputy,\r\nMr. Mooyart, at Ratnapoora, who, however, we unfortunately found was\r\nabsent from home. Next day, however, we had unmistakable evidence that our\r\nletters had, very shortly after our departure, reached the hands they were\r\nintended for, by a variety of precautions which the hospitable gentleman\r\nmust have at once arranged with a view to our greater comfort. While yet\r\non the second-half of our road to Gilli-Mali, night overtook us, and we\r\nprosecuted our march by torch-light through the dense jungle. Our guides\r\nand porters had shown some reluctance to enter this jungle, partly on\r\naccount of the swarms of land-leeches (_litchies_, as they are termed\r\nhere, doubtless by a corruption of the English name), which are especially\r\nactive during the night, partly from other causes of anxiety. Accordingly,\r\nthey kept reciting Cingalese ditties, alternated with shrill yells, or\r\nshouted, so as to be heard at a distance; whether to drive away evil\r\nspirits, or to frighten the _chetah_ or leopard, we could not ascertain.\r\nNo long time elapsed ere we ourselves began to perceive traces of having\r\nbeen victimized by that most uncomfortable of guests, the land-leech. The\r\nnaked Hindoos were incessantly occupied with pulling off these painful\r\nblood-suckers, and we had to call a halt from time to time, in order to\r\nloosen and carefully fling them away, as they had succeeded in reaching\r\nthe skin, through the trousers immediately above the boot. They are found\r\nup to an elevation of 4000 feet above the sea on the mountains, chiefly in\r\ndamp or wet localities, and are most active during the evening and night\r\nin the selection of a victim.\r\n\r\nAt Gilli-Mali, we fell in with Mr. Braybrooke, an English engineer, who\r\nmost hospitably invited us to his bungalow, and with whom we conversed\r\nupon topics relating to Ceylon, till far into the night.\r\n\r\nNext day we had to ascend the Peak itself; which is in so far a difficult\r\nundertaking on the side from which we approached it, that one has gained\r\nno vantage-ground at Gilli-Malli, our last night's resting-place, towards\r\nreaching the summit, so that one sees it in its entire colossal height of\r\nabove 7000 feet directly in front; whereas, in ascending from Kandy, one\r\nhas already, at Neuwera Ellia, attained an elevation of 4000 feet, which\r\ncan be performed in a carriage. We set out at 7 A.M., and after an\r\nhour-and-a-half's march, gained the last village, Balahab-a-Dullu, in the\r\nBuddhist temple of which is kept a flat metal dish, adorned with silver\r\n_rosettes_, with which the imprint of the holy footstep is covered over at\r\nthe season of the annual pilgrimage. On the table, before a colossal\r\nfigure of Buddha, were strewn, as usual, a quantity of flowers presented\r\nby the faithful; these were the flower-shrubs of the _Areca palm_,\r\n_Hibiscus_, _Alamanda_, _Tagetes_; also, close to the wooden statue, are\r\nplaced several small figures of silver or wood, 3 or 4 inches long. The\r\npriest also showed us a magnificent manuscript of at least 1000 palm\r\nleaves, closely and beautifully engraved on both sides with Cingalese\r\ncharacters, which belonged to the temple, and was guarded with great care.\r\n\r\nAt a solitary house on the road, we left our guides and porters to discuss\r\ntheir modest repast, which, in consequence of the strict ordinances of the\r\nBuddhist faith, consists of vegetable substances only. Reclining on a mat\r\nspread on the ground, each took a piece of green plantain leaf, scattered\r\nupon it a little rice which they had just brought with them, and some\r\nchili (red Spanish pepper), and thence conveyed their simple food to their\r\nmouth with the hand. This frugal meal was speedily concluded, and we once\r\nmore pushed forward. From this point we had the dense covert of the high\r\nforest trees, the lofty foliage of which afforded a most agreeable shade,\r\nand kept us comparatively cool. The path, which consists simply of\r\nravines, formed by the rush of torrents during the rainy season, is so\r\nsteep that it seems like one uninterrupted flight of stairs, the steps of\r\nwhich seem partly constructed by Nature, partly by the hand of man.\r\nFrequently they are artistically chiselled in the solid rock; at one\r\nstupendous precipice a Cingalese monarch has had four flights, of 250\r\nsteps in all, hewn out of the living rock. Here and there, also, ladders\r\nhave been contrived, the rounds of which are composed of pieces of bamboo\r\nbound together, by which one clambers up. The whole route bears marks of\r\nbeing much used, and is considerably worn, the stones being rubbed quite\r\nsmooth. Under the damp shade of the forest are found a vast quantity of\r\nthe most beautiful ferns and _Lycopodium_ (Club-moss; or Wolf's-claw, as\r\nit is called in Sweden, whence the Linnæan name); from the delicate beauty\r\nof the _Jungermania_ (Star-tip), to the tree-like fern, _Filius\r\nPhyllophisidos_, which vies with the giants of the forest. The more deeply\r\nshaded spots are adorned here with beautiful balsams, a genus of plants\r\nwhich, besides being unusually luxuriant and beautiful in this district,\r\nexhibits certain peculiarities of form not usually met with.\r\n\r\nAt one place, called Nihilabellagalla, there was pointed out to us, at a\r\nfew paces to the side of the road, near a rugged projecting rock with a\r\nsteep declivity in front, a narrow valley which seemed to be closed in by\r\nperpendicular walls of rock on the opposite side. This _cul de sac_, we\r\nwere informed, was a favourite resort of numerous wild elephants. A shot\r\nfired at this point, with the gun directed towards the rocks opposite,\r\nreturned a thundering echo.\r\n\r\nBy 4 P.M. the last halt, or resting-place, was reached, above which the\r\nsingular-looking cone towers sheer overhead, some 500 or 600 feet high.\r\nThe vapours which, during the entire day, had been playing about the\r\nsummit, from time to time lifted like a veil, as though to indulge us with\r\nan opportunity of beholding this sublime mountain-peak under the magical\r\neffect of twilight. Our native retinue, which had gathered fresh\r\naccessions of strength at every place we passed, and now consisted of from\r\n24 to 30 persons, showed no inclination to proceed farther, but appeared\r\ndesirous of passing the night at the last halting-place, which was nothing\r\nbut a sort of hovel. It was only by a resolute expression of our\r\ndetermination to reach the summit the same evening that they gave in.\r\nTheir reluctance arose from an idea that no one could with impunity pass\r\nthe night on the highest point of the mountain--which, indeed, is natural\r\nenough, since the sharp night-air at such an elevation may well be\r\nprejudicial to the health of those who are not sufficiently protected\r\nagainst its attacks.\r\n\r\nThe last portion of the ascent is so steep, and so difficult, that all\r\nsuperfluous baggage was left behind, and we took with us only what was\r\nabsolutely indispensable. Thus far we had seen occasional traces of\r\nelephants, sometimes so fresh, that they could not have been more than an\r\nhour old. According to a report of Major Skinner, the unmistakable marks\r\nof one of these animals was remarked in the year 1840 quite close to the\r\nrock which bears the sacred footprint! At the steepest points, iron\r\nladders have been made fast, by which the visitor has to scramble up.\r\nThere were, also, innumerable chains fastened to the rock, of every\r\ndescription and variety of link, which swung to and fro by dozens on\r\neither hand, some eaten away with age and rust, some forged quite lately,\r\nit being considered a meritorious work to provide such as a protection\r\nagainst the occurrence of accidents. By 6 P.M., we at last reached the\r\nsummit, and were rewarded with a panoramic view of indescribable\r\nmagnificence. The mists were almost entirely dispersed, and in the clear,\r\ncalm, evening light, the eye wandered at pleasure over the vast, almost\r\nlimitless, panorama at our feet, as far as the sea, barely visible in the\r\ngrey distance. Bounding our view from north-west to east, the mountain\r\nranges rose by three distinct terraces of hills, each behind the other,\r\nand in regular gradations, till they culminated in the highest peak on the\r\nisland, the Pedro-talla-galla, which overtops Adam's peak by nearly 1000\r\nfeet,[95] but presents no pre-eminent peak, similar to that on which we now\r\nstood. The remainder of the horizon was filled with low mountains, which\r\ngradually became more and more flat as they approached the coast. The\r\nfollowers of three religions,--Buddhists, Brahmins, and Mahometans, stand\r\nface to face with each other on this space of barely a few steps, in order\r\nto bow before these visible emblems, in sincere devotion to the invisible\r\nDeity. The highest surface, which is nearly level, is of an irregular oval\r\nform, and is about 60 or 70 feet in length, by from 36 to 40 feet in\r\nbreadth, and is inclosed within a wall 5 feet in height, with two\r\nentrances on the west and south, while the north-east corner is shut out\r\nby an artificially rounded rock, easily surmounted, however, by any one\r\nwho ascends it. In the middle of this enclosure stands a block of rock\r\nsome 10 or 11 feet high, which, on the extreme top, has a depression, the\r\ndivine _Sri-pada_, or Holy Footstep. The adoration consists chiefly of\r\nofferings of flowers which are brought up hither, and presented with\r\ninnumerable genuflections, invocations, and exclamations of \"_Sadoo_,\"\r\nwhich corresponds to the Christian Amen. The impressed foot-print is\r\nascribed by the Buddhists to the last incarnation of Buddha, the gentle\r\nhermit Gautama; while it is regarded by the Brahmins as the footstep of\r\nSiva, and by the Mahometans as that of Adam, as being the spot on which\r\nthe progenitor of the human race stood so long, doing penance after his\r\nexpulsion from Paradise, until the Almighty pardoned him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: The precise relative elevations of the two mountains are,\r\nPedro-talla-galla 8280 feet, Adam's Peak 7420 feet. Two other peaks of the\r\nmain range are also higher than Adam's Peak, viz. Totapella 7720 feet, and\r\nKirrigal-potta 7810 feet, while the plains, or table-lands, of Welinani\r\nand Neuwera Ellia are, respectively, no less than 6990 feet and 6210 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.]\r\n\r\nThis depression, in which only the most unbridled imagination can see any\r\nresemblance to the human foot, is about 5 feet in length by 2-1/2 in\r\nbreadth, and is set, as it were, in a level stratum of mortar, several\r\ninches in height, by six in breadth, shaped to resemble the outline of the\r\nhuman foot. At its anterior extremity, it presents a straight line, on\r\nwhich the five toes are artificially formed by several tolerably thick,\r\nnarrow crevices, filled with mortar, and about 8 or 9 inches in length,\r\nwhich jut inwards, the great toe being on the right or east side, and thus\r\nindicating that it is a representation of the left foot. At the heel end\r\nthe setting of mortar is somewhat narrowed and rounded off. Over the whole\r\naffair a wooden temple with balustrades open on all sides, has been\r\nerected, which is fastened by iron chains to the rock, and to beams of\r\nrhododendron fastened on the N.W. side, outside the wall, to prevent its\r\nbeing swept away by the storms which, on this lofty, exposed peak,\r\noccasionally rage with great vehemence. These cables, as also several of\r\nthe poles by which the temple was supported, were thickly hung with carved\r\nfigures of Buddha enveloped in linen cloth, which, originally the votive\r\nofferings of pilgrims, and bleached by long exposure, fluttered in the\r\nbreeze. On the front of the temple is erected a penthouse roof, shading a\r\nbench beneath, on which several of our porters, who regarded our impious\r\npresence, and still more impious admeasurements of the holy footprint,\r\nwith a horror which they flattered themselves was unobserved, deposited\r\ntheir offerings of flowers, and humbly bent the knee. On the west side,\r\nunder two small distinct roofs, were two bells, and quite apart, on the\r\nrock itself, and somewhat in the background, a smaller temple. Between the\r\nblock of rock and the inner half of the enclosure, a small house has been\r\nerected, 12 feet long by 6 feet broad, which is used as a shelter at night\r\nby the priests who are on duty during the pilgrimage season,[96] in which\r\nwe too took up our quarters. Suddenly, from the depths below there arose,\r\nthrough the unbroken silence of the night, a confused murmur, in which the\r\nsounds of human voices were plainly recognizable. The singularity of such\r\na phenomenon produced a certain degree of excitement among our\r\nsuperstitious spectre-dreading followers, inasmuch as it had never\r\nhappened that strangers undertook the ascent of the peak at night, seeing\r\nit gives trouble enough to reach the summit by daylight. By degrees we\r\nperceived a number of torches borne by natives, who, with loud and\r\nlong-continued cheers, set about slowly ascending the ladders. To the\r\ninquiries of our followers they made no reply; and we had, in a word, to\r\nwait a considerable interval, until, indeed, the leading torch-bearer had\r\nreached the summit, ere we were enlightened as to the object of this\r\nmysterious nocturnal visit. How great, and let us add, agreeable was our\r\nsurprise at finding ourselves suddenly surrounded by a choice array of\r\nwines, with food of various sorts, which the overflowing hospitality of\r\nMr. Mooyart had dispatched after us to the summit of Adam's Peak, together\r\nwith his card, the whole being conveyed in huge baskets by the supposed\r\nspectres! A cheerful fire speedily blazed up, at which our tea and\r\nprovisions were cooked, and, as may well be supposed, while, enjoying our\r\ndelicate fare, we thankfully toasted the kind and thoughtful donor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: The dry season, occurring in the south-west side of the\r\nisland from January to April, is likewise the chief season of pilgrimage,\r\nat the end of which the entire amount of the offerings, annually averaging\r\nfrom £250 to £300 sterling, is handed over to the High-Priest of Buddha.]\r\n\r\nDeep silence once more fell on all around, no cry of any wild beast\r\nreached us at this elevation, no hum of insect broke upon the awful\r\nstillness. Our coolies lay cowering together around the drooping blaze,\r\nseeking some shelter against the night air. One division stowed themselves\r\naway in a second sleeping-house for priests, which had been run up some\r\ntwenty paces distant, in which we also were in the end fain to seek\r\nshelter from the ever-increasing keenness of the air, the temperature of\r\nwhich fell to 54°.5 Fahr., where, with our wrappers drawn close around us,\r\nand stretched at full length on the bare rock, we awaited the approach of\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe first faint glimmer of dawn invited us once more to the open air, in\r\norder to contemplate the wonderful aspect of Nature at this elevation. We\r\nhad, after leaving Ratnapoora, taken barometrical and thermometrical\r\nobservations, with the view of determining the elevation at nine different\r\nstations, which had been, wherever practicable, selected in such manner,\r\nthat by means of them the various limits of certain classes of vegetation\r\nwere indicated, which in many instances are marked out with extraordinary\r\ndistinctness upon the perpendicular side of the peak. These series of\r\nobservations, which were at the same time supplemented by investigations\r\nas to the temperature of the soil and of various springs, will be compared\r\nwith the results of previous scientific visitors to the summit of Adam's\r\nPeak, and published in another form. The geology of the isolated pinnacle\r\nof Adam's Peak, so far as the dense covering of primeval forests permitted\r\nus to observe, is uncommonly simple and uniform. The chief directions of\r\nthe lofty chain of mountains in Southern Ceylon, separated from each other\r\nby level plateau-like depressions, is from S.S.E. to N.N.W., corresponding\r\nlikewise with the chief directions of the strata of gneiss, of which these\r\nmountains are composed. The gneiss is uniformly of a species not often met\r\nwith, studded with garnets, and between its strata are inserted single\r\nbeds of hornblende-gneiss and splinters of pure hornblende, as also\r\ngranulite-gneiss and pure granulite. The steep, final cone of the rock\r\nconsists of a granulitic gneiss of varying texture from coarse to fine,\r\nand abounding in garnets. Everywhere, even up to the highest summit, the\r\ngneiss is decomposed on the surface into laterit-like products. The huge\r\nblocks of brown ironstone, however, which are found near the summit, in\r\nthe hollow path by which it is customary to ascend, owe their origin to\r\nthe decomposition of the hornblende.\r\n\r\nAfter these interesting observations, admeasurements, and investigations,\r\nmade at the summit of the most remarkable peak in the world, had been\r\nbrought to a conclusion, we set out on our return to Gilli-Mali, which we\r\nreached late at night. Here we found, at the abode of our hospitable\r\nentertainer, Mr. Braybrooke, a fresh guest, who likewise intended to\r\nascend Adam's Peak the following day. This was the well-known Count Medem,\r\na Russian gentleman, who has frequently traversed both the old and new\r\nworlds, and was now about making a second visit to China.[97] The next day\r\nsaw us at Ratnapoora, from which point we continued our return journey on\r\nthe waters of the Kalu-Gunga, or Black River, as far as Caltura.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Count Medem died the same year at Shanghai.]\r\n\r\nOur boat consisted of two trunks of trees hollowed out and fastened\r\ntogether, upon which was erected a semicircular tilt, covered with the\r\nleaves of the Fan Palm (_Borassus Flabelliformis_), under which one might\r\nsit or lie at pleasure, sheltered from the sun. As the mail-car that runs\r\ndaily from Colombo to Caltura was already full, we were compelled, in\r\norder to pursue our journey to Galle, to make use of the native waggon, or\r\nbullock-bandy. This is a two-wheeled cart drawn by oxen, and covered with\r\na semicircular tilt of palm-leaves, beneath which there was room for two\r\npersons to lie at full-length packed closely together. The oxen, of a\r\nbreed that have humps and erect horns, are small, and walk with a quick,\r\nshort tramp, while their entire bodies are tattooed with Cingalese\r\ncharacters and ornaments. The horns are usually adorned with metal tips,\r\nand frequently are dyed, the one red, the other green. The cross-piece of\r\nthe pole is fastened to the neck instead of the customary yoke, and the\r\ncord for guiding the animal passes through the nose. The driver either\r\nstrides along between the two oxen, or sits with his back to them on the\r\npole. The rate of progression by this national conveyance is so slow, that\r\nthe mail-car which left Colombo the day after overtook us long ere we\r\nreached our destination, and it was with some difficulty we reached Galle\r\nin time for the overland steamer which was to bring us to Madras.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.--TRACK FROM POINT DE GALLE TO MADRAS.]\r\n\r\nAt 6 A.M. of the 16th January, the _Novara_ set sail from the roads of\r\nPoint de Galle with light breezes off the land, and steered southerly in\r\norder to avoid the Basses or Baxos, a much-dreaded rocky shoal,\r\ntraditionally alleged to be the remains of the island of Giri, swallowed\r\nup by the sea, and which, owing to the very strong current, require the\r\nutmost care to be observed, in order to avoid drifting right upon them.[98]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: A late survey, instituted with the intention of erecting a\r\nlighthouse on the \"Basses,\" proved a failure, in consequence of the ground\r\nhaving sunk in while an examination was being made by the diver, and left\r\nnothing but holes filled with water, in which, according to the report of\r\nthe fishermen, besides fish and molluscs, sea-snakes are occasionally\r\nseen, of a light-gray colour, and about 4 or 5 feet in length.]\r\n\r\nThe evening before our departure, the Consul for Hamburg had requested\r\nfrom the Commander of the Expedition the favour of a free passage to\r\nMadras, on board our frigate, for a native of Berlin, named Neupert. This\r\nman had come to Ceylon a long time previously with a company of\r\nrope-dancers, and had at first made a good deal of money as an acrobat and\r\njuggler, despite the dangerous competition of the Indian practitioners,\r\nbut had afterwards lost his all, and had been for some weeks in a pitiable\r\nplight. The request was at once acceded to, and Neupert came on board\r\nduring the night. His luggage did not encumber him much. However, although\r\nthe greatest part of his effects had disappeared in Galle, he fortunately\r\nhad kept his various apparatus; and, by way of showing his gratitude for\r\nthe free passage that had been accorded to him, professed his willingness,\r\nin the course of the voyage, to give us some specimens of his skill on\r\ndeck. Accordingly, one fine afternoon, he gave us an entertainment out on\r\nthe open ocean, which not alone hugely pleased the sturdy tars grouped\r\ntogether on the forecastle, but ultimately, in consequence of a collection\r\nset on foot for the unfortunate Berlin acrobat, procured him enough ready\r\nmoney to enable him to pass the first week after his arrival at Madras\r\nfree from anxiety, besides supplying him with a fresh outfit.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days after our departure from Galle, several severe cases\r\noccurred of hemeralopia, chiefly among members of the ship's band. Every\r\nevening, as darkness set in, these men lost all power of distinguishing\r\nobjects, and had to be led about like blind men. In Vienna, we had been\r\nadvised by various physicians there, with a view to the confirmation or\r\nrefutation of the popular belief, to try the use of boiled ox-liver;[99]\r\nand, as one of the oxen shipped at Ceylon had been slaughtered, we were in\r\na position to make the desired experiment, which, it must be confessed,\r\nproved eminently successful. This time, moreover, several of those thus\r\nafflicted were treated with cooked pig's-liver, which was given them to\r\neat, while the steam rising from the dish was applied to their eyes. But\r\nwe had, on our return voyage, the most convincing proof of the efficacy of\r\nthe liver of animals of the ox tribe in cases of night-blindness, when\r\nabove twenty of those afflicted, after frequent relapses during the voyage\r\nfrom Valparaiso to Gibraltar, were treated in the last-named port with\r\nox-liver, and dismissed permanently cured.[100]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: This cure is likewise very much resorted to, even of late\r\nyears, among the Highlands of Scotland!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: During the entire voyage round the globe, there occurred 75\r\ncases of _Hemeralopia_; the largest number of which, 60, occurred between\r\nCape Horn and Gibraltar. The remainder were isolated cases, occurring at\r\nRio, Ceylon, the Nicobar Islands, and on the voyage from China to Sydney.]\r\n\r\nThe voyage from Ceylon to Madras was, on the whole, monotonous and void of\r\ninterest, with the exception of one single event, which no one on board is\r\nlikely to forget for the remainder of his life. About 3.30 P.M. of the 2nd\r\nJanuary, 1858, there suddenly resounded from the hold, the astounding cry\r\nof \"Fire! fire!\" Everyone rushed, in the utmost excitement, on deck. It\r\nturned out that a by no means insignificant quantity of pure alcohol,\r\nwhich was stowed away in the hold for the preservation of specimens of\r\nnatural history, had, from some unknown cause, caught fire. Forthwith the\r\npumps were manned, the sails clewed up, all the portholes closed, so as to\r\ncut off the slightest draught, and all the hammocks of the crew trundled,\r\n_pêle-mêle_ on deck anyhow, out of the quarter-nettings, in which they are\r\nstowed away during the day, there to be dipped in sea-water, and in that\r\nwringing-wet condition applied, partly in extinguishing the flames, partly\r\nin preventing the fire from spreading. In less than a quarter of an hour\r\nthe worst danger was over, and our wonted quiet restored, despite the\r\nfirst terrible excitement. On a more searching investigation, several of\r\nthe tin carboys in the hold, filled with spirits of wine, and kept between\r\nlayers of sand in iron chests, were found to have been corroded till the\r\nliquor had oozed through, while the air, having free access to the sand,\r\nhad become strongly impregnated with gas. This atmosphere, impregnated as\r\nit was with alcoholic fumes, took fire on one of the sailors carelessly\r\nentering the hold with a badly-fastened lantern, and in a moment the light\r\nflames which speedily enveloped the man in such a confined space, at once\r\ngave the alarm. The full carboys remained uninjured by the fire. Had such\r\na catastrophe happened, and the whole quantity of spirit (about 40\r\ngallons) taken fire, considering the immense quantities of combustible\r\nmatter we had on board, among the rest a ton-and-a-half of gunpowder, the\r\nupshot must have been of a far less agreeable nature. The extraordinary\r\nlightning-like activity displayed by the entire ship's company on this\r\noccasion was something wonderful. Each man seemed to have got wings. There\r\nwas the most laudable emulation displayed by all hands in seeking to save\r\nthe lives of themselves and others from such a terrible doom.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th January, at 7.30 P.M., we anchored in Madras Roads, so dreaded\r\nfor their insecurity, about three nautical miles from the shore, and in 9\r\nfathoms (56 feet English). Even in the calmest weather there is a\r\ntremendous surf on this coast, and from October to December, in which\r\nstrong gales blow from the N.E., it is all but unapproachable. For this\r\nreason, so soon as the wind increases so as to endanger the ships in the\r\nroads, a flag is hoisted on a staff at the Master Attendant's office, that\r\nthey may put to sea at once. On the second signal, all ships must quit the\r\nRoads for fear of being dashed through the surf upon the beach.\r\n\r\nFrom the city we heard a running fire of musketry and some salutes with\r\ncannon, which, considering the prevalence of warlike rumours and movements\r\nin the then circumstances of India, made us conjecture that the natives of\r\nthe Coromandel coast were also in insurrection against the English.\r\nHowever, we learned afterwards that the musketry and salvoes proceeded\r\nfrom the troops stationed near the drilling-ground, who were receiving\r\ntheir general on his return from parade with a salute. The following day\r\n(Sunday, the 31st January, 1858) the European community of Madras fell\r\ninto a precisely similar error in consequence of our salute, which they,\r\nbeing at that hour assembled at worship, mistook for a much less peaceful\r\nand agreeable intimation, so that the majority, dreading an outbreak,\r\nhurried to their houses in deep anxiety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MASULI BOAT AT MADRAS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF MADRAS (AND PROPOSED PIER).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IX.\r\n\r\n                               Madras.\r\n\r\n      DURATION OF STAY FROM 30TH JANUARY TO 10TH FEBRUARY, 1858.\r\n\r\n   \"Catamarans\" and \"Massuli\" boats.--Difficulty of disembarkation,\r\n     and plans for remedying it.--History.--Brahminism.--Festival\r\n     in honour of Vishnu.--Employment of Heathens under a Christian\r\n     Government.--Politics and Religion.--Laws of Brahminic faith.--\r\n     The Observatory.--Museum of Natural History and Zoological\r\n     Garden.--Academy of Fine Arts.--Medical School.--Infirmary.--\r\n     Orphan Asylum.--Dr. Bell.--Lancastrian Method of Teaching\r\n     Children first applied in Madras.--Colonel Mackenzie's\r\n     Collection of Indian Inscriptions and Manuscripts.--The Palace\r\n     of the former Nabob of the Coromandel Coast.--Journey by rail\r\n     to Vellore.--_Fête_ given by the Governor in Guindy Park.--\r\n     Visit to the Monolithic Monuments of Mahamalaipuram.--\r\n     Excursion to Pulicat Lake.--Madras Club.--_Fête_ in honour of\r\n     the members of the _Novara_ Expedition.--\"Tiffin\" and dance on\r\n     board.--Departure from Madras.--Zodiacal light.--Shrove\r\n     Tuesday in the tropics.--Arrival at the Island of Kar-Nicobar.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning after our arrival in Madras Roads, a native boat came\r\nalongside, of the sort known as \"Catamarans,\" having on board two\r\nnatives, who brought off from the authorities of the port the customary\r\npapers to be filled up. This extraordinary and very primitive boat\r\nconsists of merely two or three trunks of trees bound together\r\nraft-fashion, on which these daring boatmen kneel. As a great part of\r\ntheir body is necessarily under water, they carry the papers and letters\r\nentrusted to them for transmission to the ships in the Roads, in\r\nturban-like wrappings which envelope their heads. Ordinarily, these men\r\nare excellent swimmers, a most requisite accomplishment to enable them to\r\nregain their boats, in the event of being swept off by the waves, or to\r\nsave themselves and others from the innumerable sharks, which frequent the\r\nentire Coromandel coast, and render it eminently dangerous. About noon, a\r\nlarger boat approached us, manned by from 15 to 20 natives, who offered\r\ntheir services as caterers, washers, agents, servants, in short as\r\n\"Dubashes\" a sort of Hindoo _factotum_; while each individual, shrieking\r\nand vociferating at the top of his voice, held high in the air, with\r\noutstretched arm, a number of written testimonials of ship-captains that\r\nhad already employed him. These boats, called \"Massuli,\" or \"Musli\" boats\r\n(from _Muchly_--fish), about 36 feet long by 5 or 6 in width, and in which\r\nalone it is possible to bring passengers and goods to land, are light, as\r\nflexible as if made of leather, and are fastened together with the elastic\r\nfibres of the cocoa-nut, being in every particular specially adapted to\r\nyield to the tremendous blows of the heavy surf, which a boat of ordinary\r\nconstruction could not possibly live through. They are for the most part\r\npretty deep, and are usually manned with from 12 to 15 naked natives, who\r\nmake use of an exceedingly smooth pallette-shaped paddle. In one of these\r\nboats, the officers of the frigate on leave, and the naturalists of the\r\nExpedition, were conveyed to land in the midst of a fresh breeze from the\r\nN.E. The more we approached the shore, the more formidable was the\r\nappearance of the tumultuous tempest-driven waves. Amid frightful yells\r\nand hurrahs, we passed in safety the first and second lines of surf. But\r\nwe had yet to encounter the third, and by far the most furious. The\r\nboatmen spread a couple of cloths over our heads, to prevent our getting a\r\nsoaking; the boat made several violent plunges forward, and was for an\r\ninstant apparently covered by the tremendous foaming billows, but seemed\r\nto glide in a most extraordinary manner over these, and finally was neatly\r\nlaid alongside the beach on the crest of the last breaker. This is the\r\ncritical moment, and the most disagreeable, because the boat is, by this\r\nmanipulation, thrown on its side, and one feels disposed to rush out, ere\r\nthe returning wave throws the boat high and dry on the sand. The noisy\r\nshrieks of the boat's crew and Coolies, or Lascars (Indian porters), with\r\nwhich the disembarkation is accompanied, combine to render it still more\r\nannoying and unpleasant. One feels a sensation of satisfaction at having\r\ngone through this remarkable, and to some extent wholly peculiar,\r\nexperience; but no one was ever known to encounter it voluntarily a second\r\ntime. The glowing picture, which numbers of travellers have drawn of the\r\nlanding at Madras, might impress many readers with the idea that their\r\nrepresentations were most probably tinged somewhat with a colouring of\r\nromance; but, in view of our own experience at what is confessedly the\r\npleasantest season of the year, there can be at certain times no\r\ndescription, however vividly sketched, but what must lag behind the\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nThere could hardly have been selected a more unsuitable site for a city,\r\nthan that of Madras, and it is only the circumstance that the entire\r\nCoromandel coast presents no more eligible haven, as also the importance\r\nof the place as the chief city of the Carnatic, which alone has a\r\npopulation of 5,000,000, that has enabled Madras to boast a population of\r\n700,000 inhabitants, and a commerce of such magnitude that 6000 vessels,\r\nBritish and foreign, are annually[101] cleared inwards and outwards, laden\r\nwith upwards of 650,000 tons of produce and goods of a total value of more\r\nthan £8,000,000 sterling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: In the year 1857, the number of trading vessels was 6241,\r\ncarrying 652,146 tons merchandise, of which 1438 were square-sailed ships;\r\nand 4803 native boats and Chinese junks. The imports of goods and metals\r\namounted to Rs. 40,563,826 (about £4,050,000 in round numbers); the\r\nexports to Rs. 40,060,656 (about £4,000,000 in round numbers). We are\r\nindebted to the kindness of Dr. Balfour for a variety of interesting\r\nstatistical _data_, the information contained in which must be transferred\r\nto the statistical portion of the _Novara_ publications.]\r\n\r\nThe spot at which vessels anchor can by no stretch of terms be called a\r\nroadstead, being in fact nothing but an open strip of coast running nearly\r\ndue north and south, so that during the N.E. monsoons, the sea that sets\r\nin is something extraordinary, and produces a tremendous surf. At no\r\nseason of the year is it practicable to reach the shore by ordinary\r\nship-boats, because the beach, being utterly unprovided with any\r\nartificial appliances, is left in its natural state--that is to say,\r\ncovered with fine sand, which lies so level that the depth is only nine\r\nfathoms two miles out at sea! Singular to say, no steps have to this day\r\nbeen taken to carry out the proposition, made many long years ago, of\r\nremedying this difficulty in reaching land, by the construction of a mole\r\nor pier, although three or four plans have already been presented by\r\ndistinguished engineers. The last and most feasible scheme, and the most\r\nlikely to be put in execution, consists in constructing a mole 1000 feet\r\nin length and 60 feet in breadth, to be erected upon iron piles driven\r\ninto the sand, and with a cross-piece at the seaward extremity--the mole\r\nconstruction resembling the letter =T=. On either side of the mole,\r\ntramways will be laid down to facilitate the transport of goods that have\r\nbeen discharged. The entire cost of this undertaking would be about\r\n£100,000--an entirely disproportionate, and, indeed, insignificant amount,\r\nwhen one takes into consideration the important consequences which must\r\nresult to trade and passenger traffic on the completion of this erection.\r\n\r\nThe earliest British settlement was at Armegon, about 36 miles north of\r\nPulicat (or about 78 miles N. by W. of Madras). The cession of a piece of\r\nland by the native Rajah of Besnayor induced the president of the old\r\nfactory at Armegon, Mr. Francis Day, to abandon the latter, and in the\r\nyear 1639, the Fort of St. George was erected at the newly-selected\r\nstation, where formerly stood the little Hindoo village of Ischinapatam.\r\nThis fort formed the nucleus, at a later period, of the city of Madras,\r\nwhich is built on the flat alluvial soil along the coast, and at present\r\ncomprises an area of about 30 (English) square miles. Its extent along the\r\nbeach from north to south is about 9 miles by an extreme width of 3-3/4\r\nmiles. Madras, like all the rest, consists of a White town, exclusively\r\ninhabited by Europeans, and a Black town, or _Pettah_, in which the\r\nnatives and all coloured residents carry on business.\r\n\r\nThe White town, which, however, presents none of the carefully laid-out\r\nstreets and compact blocks of houses involuntarily suggested by the word\r\n\"town,\" but rather resembles a gigantic park, in which are situated a vast\r\nnumber of comfortable ornamental villas, rises at its highest point 20\r\nfeet above the sea; whereas the Black town, at several points--for\r\ninstance, Popham's Broadway--is hardly 8 feet above the level of spring\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nWhile in Ceylon we had had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the\r\ninfluence exercised by Buddhism over the political and social condition of\r\nthe island; here we, for the first time, found ourselves confronted with\r\nthe followers of Brahmah. At the moment of our arrival, the principal\r\nfestival of the year was being celebrated in honour of Vishnù, one of the\r\nthree godheads of the Brahminical faith. It lasted fourteen days, and was\r\ncelebrated with much pomp. Temples were improvised, and some dancing\r\nplatforms erected for the female servants of the temple and \"_bayadères_.\"\r\nIn one of these dancing saloons, adorned in the most marvellous manner, a\r\nsort of altar rose in the background, richly hung with gold filagree work\r\nand stained cut-glass, and fringed with singular representations of the\r\ngod. In the doorway stood, on the left hand side, a copy of the statue of\r\nthe Venus de' Medici; on the right, of the Apollo Belvedere; on a small\r\ntable were visible butterflies, fire-flies, and conchs, in ornamental\r\nglass cases. On the walls, of plain deal boards, were suspended on one\r\nside, adjoining the portrait of Anthony da Padua, a number of\r\nrepresentations of voluptuous Oriental \"_odalisques_;\" on the other, near\r\nan engraving in copper of Carlo Barromeo, all sorts of obscene engravings,\r\nsuch as are offered for sale only in the most abandoned quarters of Paris\r\nand London, and then under the cover of night. For that matter, we believe\r\nthat the Hindoo priests, who superintended the erection of this hall\r\nconsecrated to the worship of Vishnù, gave themselves less anxiety\r\nrespecting the subjects treated of in the pictures suspended round, than\r\nthat the walls should appear richly decorated with engravings and\r\npictures. Adjoining this half-open dancing booth for the women in\r\nattendance on the temple, rises the chief Hindoo temple in Madras, a\r\nstately edifice of blocks of syenite, and surrounded by a lofty wall\r\npainted with the usual white and red streaks; and on which a fleecy-coated\r\nlong-tailed baboon was performing his antics. Two gloomy pyramidal towers\r\nshoot up from the wall of the temple, and a beautiful colonnade leads to\r\nthe entrance porch. A huge tank, almost resembling a pond, in which the\r\nHindoos thrice daily performed their ceremonies, and went through their\r\nablutions, lies in front of the temple, surrounded on its remaining sides\r\nby buildings for various purposes, while a stately elephant, specially\r\nconsecrated to the service, is kept on the side next the temple, which\r\ncarries up a pitcher of water every forenoon from the pool in front of the\r\npagoda, one of the servants attached to the temple sitting on his back\r\nholding it, while a second, seated behind him, keeps waving a fan in\r\neither hand. The elephant is first conducted round the temple and then\r\ninside, in order to present the water to the god. This elephant (which\r\nanimal it seems is itself an incarnation of Vishnù) had the distinguishing\r\nmark of the sect, as also several other indications of a similar nature\r\nrichly tatooed upon his huge broad forehead. Every evening during the\r\ncontinuance of the fourteen days' festival, the various temples and\r\ndancing booths were brilliantly illuminated with wax tapers and oil lamps,\r\nbut admission was refused to the profane, and in the eyes of Brahmah,\r\nunbelieving Europeans, a rule which was everywhere enforced with much\r\npoliteness but unvarying firmness. Moreover, everything that the hand of a\r\nEuropean has touched is unclean to the Hindoo. Only the _Pariah_, or\r\n\"outcaste,\" the very lowest class of the people, eats any food that has\r\nbeen prepared in the kitchen of a Christian.\r\n\r\nThe most substantial part of the festival, however, was fortunately not\r\nconfined to the interior of the temple, but took place in the streets,\r\nthrough which, during the period the festival lasted, immense processions\r\nof Hindoos, praying, singing, and dancing, used to pass every evening\r\nabout 11 P.M. on their way from one temple to another, so that we were in\r\nno want of picturesque objects. First, a band of musicians would lead the\r\nway, with the peculiar little drum or tom-tom, whining pipes, and blaring\r\nclarinets. It was more like the noise of a lot of children's instruments\r\nthan music. Next came a Hindoo riding on a gaily-bedizened ox, after whom\r\nappeared a number of girls and \"_Bayadères_,\" dressed in white clothes,\r\ntheir hair richly dressed, and with rings through their nostrils, while\r\nthe flaps of their ears were adorned with richly-gemmed ear-rings hanging\r\ndown to the neck, and moving both hands and feet as they danced before the\r\nsacred figure, which was drawn along by 24 sturdy believers in Vishnù. The\r\nimage was placed on a daïs thickly overspread with flowers, filagree work,\r\nand small mirrors, approached by steps, and with a parasol outspread\r\noverhead; in a vehicle in front was a sort of figure dressed up in\r\nflowers. On either side a multitude of torch-bearers strode along, with\r\nsulphurous lights and other means of illumination, or iron frames, on\r\nwhich were disposed in pyramidal form or like a bow, from 7 to 13\r\nfireballs, which, let off at intervals alternately with Bengal lights and\r\nrockets, formed a veritable ocean of light. A tub filled with cocoa-nut\r\noil was dragged behind, from which the cotton wicks were kept constantly\r\nreplenished, so that the flames continued unintermittently. Wherever the\r\nprocession passed the by-standers stood with hands reverentially folded.\r\nMany had the thresholds of their houses gaily adorned with flags and\r\nilluminated with paper lamps, others let off sky-rockets. From time to\r\ntime, the procession halted for a moment, the female dancers formed two\r\nrows, and some of their number went through a sort of dance, in which they\r\nperformed a set of stereotyped motions with their hands, and chanted the\r\npraises of the god in a most monotonous chorus. Thousands upon thousands\r\nof Hindoos joined the procession, so that we could hardly make way through\r\nthe crowds. The yelling, heat, odour of oil, and stink of sulphur were\r\nabsolutely intolerable. As often as the procession paused, the noise was\r\nredoubled, the confusion became tenfold. Itinerant confectioners, who\r\noffered for sale all sorts of sweetmeats, prepared either from the kernel\r\nor milk of the cocoa-nut, drew back reluctantly when the eye of a stranger\r\nwas directed towards their piled-up delicacies, through dread lest a mere\r\nglance from him should blight their stock in trade. On the other hand, we\r\nremarked some of these vendors pressing forward with eagerness to satisfy\r\nthe curiosity of strangers by offering small samples of their eatables, so\r\nas the more easily to propitiate and get rid of these dangerous guests,\r\nand leave the poor Hindoo in peace and unharmed! As Christianity makes but\r\nslow progress among the Hindoos, and as the tendencies of the English\r\nresidents in India do not point, as of yore among the Spaniards in\r\nAmerica, towards the violent conversion of the heathen natives with the\r\nalternative of annihilation, but rather towards political and commercial\r\ninfluences, we find the British Government regarding with placid\r\nindifference the abominations of Hindoo worship, which, even to this hour,\r\ntake the form of laceration of the flesh and self-immolation, rather than,\r\nby ruling with the strong hand, fan the religious fanaticism of the\r\nmultitude, without the possibility of Christianity becoming a gainer.\r\nAmong the thousands upon thousands who were celebrating the festival of\r\nVishnù in such a heathenish fashion, there undoubtedly were many who are\r\nin the employ of Government, which has no scruples about appointing\r\nHindoos of all sorts to the various posts in the public service. The\r\nEnglish State Church which held that such appointments tended, not very\r\nindirectly, to support heathenism,[102] earnestly remonstrated against the\r\npractice, but the Government becoming daily more convinced that the\r\ndoctrines and homilies of the Christian faith continued to be entirely a\r\ndead letter among the Hindoos, seems to hold fast to a policy of seeking\r\ngradually to introduce Christianity and European civilization among the\r\nIndian races, by means of equality of rights and assimilation of laws, by\r\na system of well-organized national, trade, and industrial education, and,\r\nabove all, by the influence of personal example. This, to be sure, is a\r\nvery slow and arduous method of conversion, inasmuch as a life of\r\nreligious observances is more deeply intertwined with the very foundations\r\nof the social system in India than in any other country of the globe, and\r\nfairly blocks the way against the expansiveness of European civilization.\r\nFor as simple as the Hindoo religion appears in its primitive principles,\r\nthe proper observance of its various rites is proportionately difficult,\r\nand full of subtle distinctions for the sincere Hindoo believer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: The East India Company even undertook the maintenance of the\r\nHindoo temples, and defrayed the receipts of the annual festival in honour\r\nof Vishnù out of the revenues. There exist in the Presidency of Madras\r\nalone 8292 Hindoo temples, with an annual revenue of about £100,000, all\r\nunder the protection and control of the Company. (See \"India, Ancient and\r\nModern,\" by David O. Allen, Boston, 1856.)]\r\n\r\nThe worship of Brahma, according to the doctrines enunciated by Brahma's\r\nown lips in the Vedas, or holy books, took its rise in the adoration paid\r\nto the powers of nature, regarded as so many divinities, especially in the\r\nexalted transcendentalism of their ideas respecting the sun, the moon, the\r\nstars, and the firmament. Thence was readily developed the belief in a\r\nsole, eternal, Almighty Creator and Ruler of the world, Brahma,\r\nrepresented as having four faces looking to the four quarters of the\r\nglobe, and reposing on a swan. This simple monotheistic belief was\r\ngradually developed into the divine manifestation of Brahma as a Triune\r\ndivinity, namely, as the Creating power (Brahma), the preserving power\r\n(Vishnù), and the destroying, and at the same time renewing, energy of\r\nnature (Siva).\r\n\r\nAlthough the revelation of Brahma has long since been completed, while\r\nVishnù and Siva are still active agencies in the world as Supporter and\r\nAugmenter respectively, Brahma is assigned a very inferior rank in the\r\nworship of the masses, although, according to the lawgiver Menù, the Moses\r\nof India, he created the Brahmins out of the substance of his head, to\r\nguide and instruct man; from his arms the Chetriyas, to protect and defend\r\nhim; from his trunk the Veisigas, to nourish and support him; and, lastly,\r\nfrom his feet the Sadras, to serve and be the property of all the other\r\ncastes.\r\n\r\nTo Brahma, the fulness of whose existence no earthly notions can embrace,\r\nthere are no temples dedicated, these being rather erected in honour of\r\nVishnù, the Intercessor and Supporter, who manifests himself in the\r\natmosphere and in water, and Siva the destroyer and regenerator of the\r\nvarious races, as also to the other divinities whom the Hindoo religion\r\nnumbers by millions, although the majority of these have several names,\r\nand the lower classes are simply Avatars, that is incarnations or\r\nmanifestations, of the superior deities. This peculiarity of the Hindoo\r\nreligion makes it impossible correctly to classify or define Indian\r\nmythology. The god Rama, for example, is frequently named for Krishna, and\r\nthe latter again for Vishnù. Vishnù, on his part, sometimes figures as\r\nRama, when he is to destroy Ravana, the tyrant of Ceylon, or as Buddha, in\r\norder to found Buddhism. Like the Proteus of Grecian fable, the Hindoo\r\nmythology assumes a thousand different shapes,--it is, in short, Pantheism\r\nin its most perfect development.\r\n\r\nA zealous Hindoo requires about four hours of each day to get through his\r\nreligious ceremonies, these being performed at different periods, as he\r\nmust bathe in the morning, at noon, and again at night, in a tank or pool\r\nbefore the temple, and recite certain prayers. For purposes of\r\nrecognition, the two chief castes wear special marks, the worshippers of\r\nVishnù having a trident painted on the forehead in either white or yellow,\r\nwhile those of Siva, on the other hand, sport three horizontal stripes, or\r\none round spot marked with the ash of burnt sandal-wood. Many Hindoos\r\nwrite on their foreheads the distinguishing insignia of both Vishnù and\r\nSiva, and look thus the more strange and peculiar.\r\n\r\nAfter every ablution these marks are painted afresh, and with much care\r\nupon the forehead, so that paint and rouge-boxes play an important part in\r\na native household. No Hindoo can partake of his exclusively vegetable\r\nnutriment, if cooked in a European kitchen, such being entirely contrary\r\nto the principles of his faith. Every servant, therefore, leaves his\r\nmaster regularly at noon, in order to partake of his simple meal of rice\r\nand vegetables, either with his family or in one of the numerous Hindoo\r\ncook-shops. The frequent holidays of the Hindoos, of which there are\r\ntwenty-one within two months, seriously interfere with trade among the\r\nnatives, and still more with the instruction of the young.\r\n\r\nHindooism, however, appears to have lost much of its originality by\r\nconstant contact with Europeans, and by the various political revolutions,\r\nand although many of these ceremonies are still kept up, and the bodies of\r\ntheir dead are still burned on pyres, yet the modern Hindoo has so far\r\nrelaxed from his ascetic austerity, as to admit of his being employed in\r\nthe various pursuits of active life. And it is not a little surprising to\r\nsee these handsome, tall, brown figures, with their insignia of Vishnù or\r\nSiva marked on their foreheads, and dressed in their sweeping plaited\r\ntogas of pure white, employed on the telegraph, the railway, the arsenal,\r\nand even the observatory, all which employments demand the utmost\r\nexactness and punctuality, and thus afford the most gratifying evidence of\r\nthe adaptability of the Hindoo race to be impressed and to benefit by\r\nEuropean civilization. With the exception of Major Jacob, the director of\r\nthe astronomical and magnetic observatory, the whole of the _employés_ are\r\nnatives, who are not indeed employed in making the actual observations,\r\nbut are found perfectly competent to compute the various calculations, and\r\nmake the requisite reductions. The institution itself is at present of but\r\nlittle importance as a place of scientific observation, in consequence of\r\nthe small support it receives, but it is to be provided with a meridian\r\ncircle, similar to that in the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nwhen it must become an important station. Strange to say, here, as at the\r\nCape, there are no observations made on the Sundays, which in the course\r\nof a year gives rise to lamentable deficiencies, especially when some\r\nnatural phenomenon of rare occurrence happens to fall upon a Sunday.\r\n\r\nWe were greatly surprised at the flourishing condition of the Central\r\nMuseum, with which is united a Zoological Garden, both set on foot in\r\n1851. In the spacious rooms of this stately edifice are ranged costly\r\nIndian antiquities and sculptures, inscriptions in Sanscrit, in stone, or\r\nmarble slabs, antique fragments of Indian monuments,[103] as also an\r\ninstructive collection of technical and ethnographical subjects, models of\r\nfortresses, ships, agricultural implements, instruments, tools, machines,\r\nand native forts. The geological department of the Museum is the weakest\r\nand poorest department; and as spirits of wine and glass jars are\r\nexpensive articles in India, the greatest number of the animals, even the\r\nfish and snakes, are simply stuffed. In the garden which surrounds the\r\nmuseum buildings are a considerable number of cages inclosing living\r\nanimals, such as monkeys, panthers, bears, giraffes, stags, gazelles,\r\ncobras, Indian hens, pigeons, marsh-birds, and singing-birds. In addition\r\nthere were _Aquaria_ with fishes arranged in groups at various spots all\r\nround the garden. Of objects of special interest there was a powerful\r\nbaboon (_Pithecus Satyrus_), above 5 feet high, fastened to a chain in a\r\nlarge monkey-house, around whom were gambolling a number of smaller\r\nspecies, as also a number of cobras in a large box with glass sides, so\r\nthat one could examine them at leisure on every side. Here we witnessed\r\nthe uncomfortable spectacle of a native engaged in cleaning the panes\r\ninside the cage and directly beneath these formidable animals, which\r\nthronged around him in such numbers that he was continually compelled with\r\none hand to resist their importunate caresses. Anyone not aware of the\r\nfact that these animals have been rendered harmless by the extraction of\r\ntheir poison-fangs, must experience a feeling of terror and astonishment\r\nat the sight of this brood of malign, stealthy-moving, hissing serpents,\r\nwith a naked Hindoo in their midst!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: These important inscriptions are explained and described in\r\nthe Selections from the Records of the Madras Government, Report on the\r\nElliot Marbles (p. 191) by R. W. Taylor, Madras, 1857.]\r\n\r\nMost astonishing and gratifying is the immense number of casual visitors\r\nthat frequent this institution for advancing education. The book for\r\ninscribing names lying in the Museum, showed for a single month no less\r\nthan 36,522 visitors, mostly natives, and this it seems has been about the\r\naverage number since the foundation of the Museum. There is also a small,\r\nvaluable library, which, by means of purchases, gifts, and exchanges, is\r\nbeing visibly added to with each year, and is accessible to visitors of\r\nall classes, the custodian and inspectors being all natives.\r\n\r\nThe Madras Literary Society, an offshoot of the Royal Asiatic Society in\r\nLondon, and now reckoning but a small number of associates, publishes from\r\ntime to time the most valuable information as to the latest achievements\r\nof science in India, and serves in a measure as a medium by which to\r\ncompare the intellectual progress of Asia and Europe. To the members of\r\nthis society the naturalists of the _Novara_ Expedition are specially\r\nbeholden for their great attention during their stay in Madras, as also\r\nfor their hearty participation in the objects of the Imperial Expedition\r\nas evidenced by their sending copies of their own various and useful\r\npublications.\r\n\r\nThere are in Madras numerous institutes devoted to the diffusion of useful\r\nknowledge among the masses, part founded and maintained by Government,\r\npart by private enterprise, and this liberality is the more praiseworthy\r\nthat the European community of Madras does not comprise much more than\r\n1600 persons, of whom only a very few settle any length of time. The\r\nEuropeans resident here are chiefly military men and merchants, who leave\r\nthe country after remaining five or ten years, as almost every one regards\r\nhis stay in this hot, sandy capital of the desert Coromandel coast, as\r\npurely provisional, and views it as a stepping-stone towards attaining\r\nsome better post, or becoming suddenly wealthy by some favourable\r\nconjuncture of circumstances. That the majority of these institutions have\r\nmore practical objects in view admits of ready proof, and is but one\r\ninstance the more of the moulding power of surrounding circumstances. In\r\nthe school of arts for instance, under Dr. Hunter's superintendence, there\r\nare 20 pupils, mostly Hindoos, who are receiving instruction in drawing,\r\nsculpture, lithography, woodcutting, etching, and photography. But in\r\norder to reduce, as far as possible, the expenses of this institution,\r\nthere is also included a manufacture of earthenware, the proceeds arising\r\nfrom the sale of which are applied to the support of the school.\r\n\r\nAnother eminently useful institution, the Medical College, which, as well\r\nas most of the other professional foundations, we visited in the company\r\nwith our hospitable and influential friend, Dr. Kelly, possesses one\r\ndivision, in which such of the natives as purpose to set up as\r\napothecaries, are at the same time so far educated as to be able, in case\r\nof necessity, to perform a few of the minor surgical operations. Of the\r\nhundred of an auditory who at the period of our visit were attending a\r\nlecture on chemistry, the majority were half-blooded Indians, dressed in\r\nthe European fashion, with a sprinkling of barely 9 or 10 Hindoos in their\r\nwhite robes, and with the Vishnù or Siva marks on their forehead. We\r\nfrequently heard the professors, among whom are several gentlemen of high\r\nscientific attainments, such, for instance, as Messrs. Evans, Lorimer,\r\nMudge, Montgomery, Mayr, &c., express their regret at the severe check\r\nwhich the development of science sustained by the outbreak of the late\r\nrevolt. Plans for a new university, a hospital, and a medical school to\r\ncorrespond are all ready, and but for that ruinous catastrophe would have\r\nbeen by this time in working order.\r\n\r\nIn other respects the present Infirmary is an ugly and unsuitable\r\nbuilding, making up about 100 beds for patients. Several of these were\r\noccupied by soldiers, who had been severely wounded under Havelock at the\r\nstorming of Delhi. The introduction of punkahs, or wind-fans, into the\r\nwards has proved so salutary, that there is an intention to have them\r\nworked without intermission day and night, by means of water power,\r\ninstead of by manual labour as hitherto. In order to be able to estimate\r\nthe boon conferred by such an improvement upon the condition of the poor\r\ninvalids, we must call to mind that the average annual temperature of\r\nMadras is about 94° Fahr., which is slightly in excess of the average\r\ntemperature at the equator, although Madras is 10 degrees north of the\r\nline. Under such climatic conditions, it is no wonder that the\r\ninvigorating wholesome breeze is known at Madras as \"The Doctor.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the benevolent institutions visited by us, we found the twin asylums\r\nfor male and female orphans of soldiers well worthy of notice in many\r\nparticulars. These are for the most part the offspring of European\r\nsoldiers married to native women, and are known as \"half-castes,\" or\r\n\"Mestizoes.\" In the Military Female Asylum, there were at this time 216\r\ngirls, who were brought up to all manner of female work, as well as taught\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic, and remained in the institution until\r\nsuitably provided for in marriage. The marriage outfit, as also a small\r\nwedding present of Rs. 50 (£5), for each girl is provided by Government,\r\nand the entire working expenses, which amount to about Rs. 30,000 (£3000)\r\nannually, are defrayed by a Government grant of Rs. 1000 (£100) a month,\r\ntogether with the interest of the funded capital, upon which Government\r\npays 8 per cent. interest.\r\n\r\nThe Military Male Orphan Asylum was founded in 1788 by means of voluntary\r\ncontributions, supplemented by a Government Subvention, and possesses a\r\nspecial historical interest from the circumstance that it was here that\r\nDr. Bell, who held the post of Head-Master in the establishment, first\r\nprojected and put into execution the method of imparting elementary\r\ninstruction, afterwards so widely renowned as the Lancastrian method of\r\nteaching, which since that period has traversed the globe, and has been\r\nintroduced into every capital in Europe. The course of instruction of the\r\ninstitution includes writing, reading, arithmetic, grammar, geography,\r\nhistory, English, Tamil, and music. The capital of the institution is\r\nvested by Government in the 4 per cent. stocks, paying 8 per cent.\r\ninterest, which, with the large amount realized within the establishment\r\nitself, is sufficient to defray all expenses without any further\r\nassistance. The number of boys is about 242. The head teacher, who\r\nobligingly conducted us over the whole establishment, which is very\r\nhandsome, called a dozen boys forward just as we were leaving, who played\r\na few simple pieces on wind instruments, on which they performed a variety\r\nof national airs with great precision. The music master was a German.\r\n\r\nAmong its casual attractions, Madras has occasionally flower shows, and\r\nexhibitions of industry, and it is exceedingly gratifying to observe how\r\nEuropean science is even here called in to elicit the treasures of nature,\r\nand administer to the necessities of mankind. The catalogue of the\r\nindustrial exhibition of 1857 shows, _inter alia_, 17 sorts of spices, 20\r\nvarieties of resin, 64 plants suitable for the distillation of oil, and 41\r\ndifferent drugs, and Dr. Kirkpatrick, a physician in Mysore, has taken the\r\ntrouble to enumerate, by their botanical and Indian names, 240 native\r\ndrugs, which had been sent to the Madras exhibition, as also their market\r\nvalue, and at the same time has subjoined the modes in which the natives\r\nuse them.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable private museums which have been formed at\r\nMadras for the illustration of the history and monuments of the southern\r\nprovinces of the Deccan, must undoubtedly be included the collection of\r\nnative inscriptions and manuscripts of the well-known Colonel Mackenzie,\r\nwhich first attracted the attention of all friends of Oriental science, as\r\nalso the British Government, through a memoir[104] of Alexander Johnston,\r\nEsq. It is a magnificent testimony to the conservative spirit of the\r\nBritish resident among heathen nations, as compared with the barbarous\r\nspirit of destruction that characterized the Spanish colonists. From an\r\nerroneous idea that they were in so doing promoting the interests of\r\nChristianity, these Romanist conquerors destroyed all sculptures and\r\nmonuments of the pagan Indian races, and, by this fanatical Vandalism, at\r\nthe same time prevented the hand of science from unfolding, as it might\r\nhave done from these important vestiges, the history of these very\r\nremarkable races from the most remote ages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: On Colonel Mackenzie's Collection, in the Journal of the\r\nRoyal Asiatic Society of Great Britain. London, 1835, p. 4, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nIn the immense old palace, surrounded by adjacent edifices and gardens,\r\nonce occupied by the King of the Coromandel coast, the renowned nabob of\r\nthe Carnatic, the offices of the English Government _employés_ are at\r\npresent located. The last of these sovereigns died a few years since, and\r\nhis former minister receives from the British Government a pension of Rs.\r\n1300 (£130) a month. Great men who have fallen do not ordinarily like to\r\nbe sought out or gazed at. There is, however, on the contrary, no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining access to the last minister of the last monarch of\r\nthe Coromandel coast, who seems to feel flattered by a visit from\r\nstrangers. On our entering, the venerable old gentleman rose from a rich\r\nthick carpet, on which he was sitting cross-legged, held out his hand in\r\nthe most affable manner, and did us the honour of accompanying us through\r\nthe palace. He had a long white beard, and wore a white turban on his\r\nhead, while his person was enveloped in white linen. A splendid staircase\r\nconducted to a council-room, adorned with a portrait of the late nabob,\r\nlife-size, executed in London. A second room has a likeness of George\r\nAugustus Frederick, Prince of Wales, dedicated to his friend,\r\nOmadal-Omrah, nabob of the Carnatic, 1st January, 1797, and of Lord\r\nCornwallis, arm in arm with a nabob, the former represented as walking\r\namong pines, the latter among palms. In the harness-room and coach-house\r\nadjoining, our obliging attendant revealed to us an endless array of\r\ngolden howdah trappings, gilt with cunning hand, which seemed to have\r\nformerly borne the mighty nabob, when riding on his elephant. As we\r\nemerged from this lumber room, filled with dust and mud, we perceived in\r\nthe square before us an immense dust-cloud, which approached nearer and\r\nnearer in its gyrations, and gradually assumed the shape of an elephant.\r\nIt was a gigantic and magnificent specimen, and proved to be the favourite\r\nelephant of the last nabob, which, like the minister himself, was reduced\r\nto eat the bread of charity. His enormous tusks were sawn half off, for\r\nwhich his attendant assigned the singular reason that the tusks of an\r\nelephant must be cut, just as we pair our nails! This pensioner-elephant,\r\nhowever, seemed to find himself in very good quarters, and was a\r\ncarefully-tended gentle creature, who carried about his chain with his\r\nproboscis, and knelt down at the word of command.\r\n\r\nAmong the other spacious apartments of this deserted palace was the\r\nbanquetting hall, as it is called, which was represented by various\r\nwriters as one of the largest rooms in the world, which, however, is a\r\ntransparent fallacy. It is hard to believe that above a thousand persons\r\ncould find room in it. At the period of our visit this apartment was used\r\nas a barrack for the English troops, in consequence of which the splendid\r\nfull-length pictures already mentioned were carefully covered. One of the\r\nsoldiers, anxious to show them to us, tore away the covering of one before\r\nwe could interfere, when we found it to be a splendid likeness, painted in\r\nLondon, of Sir Thomas Monroe, a former governor of Madras.\r\n\r\nIn the first few days of our stay in Madras, we made an excursion to the\r\nfort of Vellore, distant about 80 miles (English) from Madras, formerly a\r\nrenowned native fort, which is now reached in a few hours by rail. This\r\nline passes through a flat uninteresting country, which is barely relieved\r\nhere and there by a couple of solitary palms or a Hindoo temple, and\r\naltogether presents a strongly African character in its scenery. Only at\r\nthose points, at which there are tanks, or artificial basins, either\r\nexcavated or formed by damming the water, does there occur a luxuriant\r\ngreen vegetation covering the parched, brown, dusty soil. These tanks are\r\nfilled in the rainy season, and during the dry season, which continues for\r\nmonths, supply the rice-fields with water for irrigation, the culture of\r\nthat plant requiring an unusually large supply of water.\r\n\r\nIf English railroads are proverbially comfortable in the mother-country,\r\nthey certainly fall off lamentably in that particular in the cars used in\r\nIndia. This deficiency is the more provoking and remarkable, considering\r\nthe various other appliances for comfort which are to be found in this\r\ncountry. The conductor, as well as the other servants of the Company, was\r\na Hindoo. On the entire line we saw but five or six white men employed.\r\nThe fares are pretty moderate, that for the entire distance, 80 miles,\r\nbeing Rupees 7-1/2 (15_s._), for first-class, and Rupees 3 (6_s._), second\r\n(about 2-1/4_d._ and 1_d._ per mile, respectively). The line is to be\r\nextended from Bejapoor, so as to unite the eastern and western coasts of\r\nthe peninsula. There are also lines projected from Madras to Bombay by\r\nPoonah and Bellary, and from Madras to Calcutta. The Governor, who (the\r\nevening previous to our departure, as we were being entertained at his\r\nsummer residence, Guindy Park,) had been apprized of our intention to\r\nvisit Vellore, was so attentive as to order the commandant to be informed\r\nby telegraph of our projected excursion at a late hour of the evening,\r\nand when we reached Vellore at 11 A.M., Captain Stevens was awaiting us at\r\nthe station, to greet the voyagers by the _Novara_ in the name of the\r\ncommandant of the fort, and convey them to the fort, three miles off, in a\r\nwaggon drawn by oxen, as is the custom of the country. The waggon was\r\nabout as large as an ordinary sized sitting-room, and contained several\r\narm-chairs and cane stools, the position of which could be altered at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nVellore was once one of the strongest fortresses in India, the wells of\r\nwhich were formerly rendered inaccessible by numerous colonies of\r\nalligators. These Hindoo fortifications have, however, lost their military\r\nimportance for Europeans, as they are on all sides \"overcrowed,\" as\r\nRittmeister Dugald Dalgetty would say, by eminences, from which they could\r\neasily be cannonaded. Within the fort itself are several extraordinary\r\nbuildings, once pagodas and houses of entertainment for priests and\r\npilgrims (_choultries_). The former sanctuary, now used as an arsenal, is\r\na _chef-d'[oe]uvre_ of architectural skill, with splendid _relievos_ and\r\nfigures sculptured in granite blocks. Most of the divinities have four\r\narms, symbolical of the universality of their power. The various edifices\r\nseem to have been once an abode of Brahmins, a sort of Hindoo monastery in\r\nwhich, in addition to the pagoda, there were ranged all round, a temple,\r\ncolonnades, and halls for the residence of the priests. In some of the\r\nsmaller apartments there still are openings for windows, with a finely\r\ncarved grating hewn out of the solid granite, the workmanship of which\r\neven the stone-cutters of our own days might feel proud of. Captain\r\nMitchell, an English officer stationed at Madras, had hit upon the idea of\r\nphotographing the most interesting of these monuments.\r\n\r\nThe fortress of Vellore has been fortified for about 1000 years! Captured\r\nby the English at the close of the last century, the then Nabob, a\r\nMussulman, was taken prisoner, and his descendants have ever since\r\ninhabited the fort as State prisoners, without ever being permitted to\r\nleave it. We inquired of the officer who accompanied us, whether the Nabob\r\nwas permitted at least to make use of the space within the fortress for\r\nexercise in the open air. \"The Mussulmen,\" replied the cautious\r\nEnglishman, \"do not care to show themselves in public; they prefer taking\r\ntheir exercise in the court in front of their residence, or in the\r\ngarden.\" Accordingly, the aged prince is rarely known even to take an\r\nairing in a palanquin. The town of Vellore itself is, in a great measure,\r\nanother place altogether, whose inhabitants are Mahometans, about 80,000\r\nin number, chiefly engaged in rice culture.\r\n\r\nWe originally intended to return the same day to Madras, the length of the\r\njourney, as well as the distance of the fort from the railway station,\r\nhaving been represented to us as much shorter than was actually the case.\r\nAccordingly, we telegraphed to the Austrian Consul, M. Campbell, Esq., an\r\nexceedingly courteous gentleman, that we should not return till the\r\nfollowing morning. How great was our astonishment to find that the\r\ntelegraph _employés_ at Vellore, both in the transcribing department, and\r\nin the management of the apparatus, which was on Morse's system, were\r\nHindoos, with their curious marks upon their foreheads, and their\r\nold-fashioned costume! They went, however, through the duties connected\r\nwith this modern invention with great adroitness. The telegraph is already\r\nin operation to Bombay, and in this direction has two separate lines.\r\nThere are, moreover, other lines in course of construction,--along the\r\ncoast to Calcutta,--along the coast to Pondicherry by Adam's Bridge,[105]\r\nfrom Madras to Point de Galle, and from Madras to Hyderabad, Bangalore,\r\nand Bellary.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Adam's Bridge--called by the Hindoos Rama's Bridge,--is a\r\nbank extending between Ceylon and the mainland of Hindostan, by the\r\nislands of Manaar and Ramisseram. It is about 30 miles in length, running\r\nin a N.W. by W. direction, about a quarter of a mile in breadth, and\r\nprincipally composed of shelving sand, through which are three main\r\nopenings or channels, that admit the passage of boats of very light\r\ndraught.]\r\n\r\nIn proceeding from the fort to the town of Vellore, which is charmingly\r\nsituated and regularly laid out, and is inhabited by numerous pensioners\r\nof the East India Company, we must cross the river Palaar (or Peliar),\r\nwhich, during the rainy season, is a headlong dangerous torrent, while in\r\nthe dry season its bed, 1000 feet wide, is but a bare expanse of sand. It\r\nis only by dint of strenuous exertions that the traveller is able to pass\r\nthis sand waste in a waggon, as it sinks at some points above the hubs of\r\nthe wheels. We had four buffalo oxen yoked, and even then had to be\r\npropelled at certain points by the assistance of some 30 coolies or Indian\r\nporters besides. This serious inconvenience was shortly after our visit to\r\nbe remedied by the erection of a splendid bridge of solid masonry, which\r\nwas to span the river by 42 arches, and will reduce the time of transit\r\nfrom the station from 1-1/4 hour to 20 minutes. Hereabouts oxen are\r\nusually employed for draught, which are of the same humped species as\r\nthose we had previously seen in Ceylon. These animals trot with uncommon\r\nswiftness, so that the rapidity of transport may stand comparison with\r\nthat where horses are employed.\r\n\r\nA few miles distant from Vellore, and visible from the hills around, lies\r\nArcot (Arucati), the residence of the nominal nabob of the Carnatic, who\r\nhas long been a pensioner of the British. The population of Arcot are\r\nmostly Mahometans, who speak a dialect of Hindustani, and drive a very\r\nactive trade.\r\n\r\nAt Vellore we resided in the house of the hospitable Lieut.-Colonel\r\nMcCally, who, in the absence of the Commandant, did the honours of the\r\nFort to the members of the _Novara_ Expedition. Here we experienced a most\r\ncordial reception, and passed a few most delightful hours in the domestic\r\ncircle of his amiable family. In the evening we made out an excursion to\r\nan adjoining eminence, 1400 feet above sea-level, 300 above Vellore, from\r\nwhich there is a commanding view over the town and neighbourhood. Seen\r\nfrom this point, the Fort looked charming, presenting itself to us,\r\nsurrounded as it is by moats and watercourses, like an island in the\r\nforeground. On the top of this hill is the bungalow or country-seat of the\r\ncollector of revenue, W. A. Sulivan, Esq., where we revelled in the\r\nenjoyment of the exquisite natural scenery, and partook of refreshment.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a number of officers, with their wives, met us at dinner at\r\nLieut.-Colonel McCally's house. The gaieties were prolonged till far in\r\nthe evening, music and songs alternating with round games and dancing, so\r\nthat we had hardly composed ourselves to sleep ere we were awakened by the\r\nservants, in order to avoid missing the train, which leaves Vellore for\r\nMadras at 6.30 A.M. By 11 A.M., we were once more in the chief city of the\r\nCarnatic.\r\n\r\nThe same afternoon the officers of the _Novara_, and the naturalists of\r\nthe Expedition, were invited to an Indian fête, which Lord Harris gave\r\nevery year at this season in his palace at Guindy Park, and to which it\r\nwas customary to invite the majority of the European residents at Madras,\r\ntogether with their families,--military, civil service, and mercantile\r\ncommunity, all being honoured with cards. This festival originated in a\r\nchildren's entertainment, which the governor had been in the habit of\r\ngiving on the birthday of his son; the latter had long since gone to an\r\nEnglish University, but the custom had survived, and the day was equally\r\ncarefully observed this year also, having been looked forward to for\r\nmonths before by the \"white\" young folks of Madras. The entertainment\r\nstill retains the character of a children's party, inasmuch as on the\r\npresent occasion there were assembled above 250 children of both sexes,\r\nvarying from 5 to 12 years of age. The total number of guests who, in\r\naddition to these, shared in the festivities was probably more than a\r\nthousand. The fête began with the performances of some 30 Indian jugglers\r\nand acrobats, on a large lawn in the park. These, as may be conceived, had\r\nbeen selected from among the most athletic and skilful. They presented a\r\nsingularly-picturesque appearance, from the diversities of age, agile\r\nboys, athletic young men, slender voluptuous-looking _Bayadères_, old\r\ngrey-headed men, and marvellous-looking old hags, with streaming white\r\nhair, and dark, piercing, gleaming eyes, recalling in their manners and\r\nappearance our own gipsies. All played at once, and performed with the\r\nmost astonishing precision a succession of breakneck feats, that set the\r\nspectator's hair on end. It was a spectacle entirely _sui generis_,\r\nthoroughly Indian in short, to behold these wild-looking brown figures,\r\nunawed by the presence they were in, going through their various\r\nperformances and feats of agility. In front of us knelt an old man who\r\nplayed with a dozen knives, which he kept circling around him with wild\r\nyells, apparently without looking at them, till he finally turned them in\r\nsuch a manner that it seemed as though the sharp points of the knives had\r\ntransfixed his hand. Next youthful acrobats sprang through paper balloons\r\nset on fire,--girls in boys' dresses climbed up bamboo poles 100 feet\r\nhigh, in the midst of continual yells,--boys executed on the damp meadow\r\nground the most extraordinary feats of agility and contortions of the\r\nlimbs, while one old fellow, to the intense astonishment of the assembled\r\nchildren, swallowed swords, as also tow and other combustible matter,\r\nwhereupon flames presently seemed to issue from his month. These, indeed,\r\nare feats of conjuring which have been performed in Europe, _usque ad\r\nnauseam_, but here all was done with such precision and dexterity (each\r\nman especially playing entirely _con amore_, evidently not to impress the\r\nspectators, but because he felt a pleasure in it himself), that the whole\r\nexhibition left quite a different impression from anything of the sort\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter this introductory amusement, the children invited were regaled with\r\na refection under an enormous tent. This was for the grown-up guests\r\nanother source of great amusement. More than 300 children took their seats\r\nat a long well-covered table, while their fathers, mothers, governesses,\r\n&c., stood behind the benches, and took special care to supply the little\r\nwatering mouths with a sufficient supply of the many delicacies before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA distribution of souvenirs to the various children present succeeded the\r\nrepast, the various articles being fastened to a gigantic tree under a\r\ntent. The tree was profusely hung with elegant paper lamps, and although\r\nthere were no pine-branches, only palm leaves, the \"_tout ensemble_,\" bore\r\na strong resemblance to a genuine Christmas tree. Fathers and mothers\r\nexpressed to us their own feelings of pleasure at beholding the glee of\r\ntheir children, and, indeed, seemed to think this the most entertaining\r\npart of the fête. The distribution lasted a considerable time, and many of\r\nthe children affected to coquette disparagingly with the presents of\r\ntheir neighbours, which these latter held fast with both hands, till at\r\nlength the whole joyous train were dismissed homewards, thoroughly pleased\r\nwith the day's proceedings.\r\n\r\nAfter this interlude there were fireworks on the lawn for the grown-up\r\nchildren, which seemed intended to serve merely as a stop-gap to while\r\naway the time between the distribution of the presents to the children and\r\nthe supper, which was laid out in the brilliantly-illuminated dining-room\r\nof the palace. The fine band, which a few days previously had so pleased\r\nus by its performances during dinner at Guindy Park, drew up on the large\r\nlawn fronting the ball-room, and during this interval played a few select\r\npieces with admirable precision. At last, supper was announced by a\r\nflourish of trumpets. Despite the spacious proportions of the apartment,\r\nthe company was too numerous to admit of all sitting down at once. We\r\ncalculated the number of guests still remaining at at least 500. The\r\nladies supped first, and afterwards the gentlemen--the Governor, Lord\r\nHarris, doing the honours in person, in the most courteous and kindly\r\nmanner. After supper the party proceeded in couples to a splendid\r\nball-room, where dancing speedily began, while over their heads an\r\nomnipresent punkah, of rich tapestry-paper, and elegantly adorned with\r\nbeautiful arabesques, swung to and fro, and kept the half-breathless\r\ndancers continually fanned by its currents of air.[106] In spite, however,\r\nof this artificial ventilating machine overhead, one must have had an\r\nextraordinary love for the dance to find pleasure in a polka or galop at a\r\ntemperature of 86° of Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: In many English families in India there prevails a sort of\r\npunkah mania, so that there is a regular hurricane incessantly blowing\r\nover their heads. Undoubtedly these artificial gales are particularly\r\nagreeable in apartments where, a large number of persons being assembled,\r\nthe atmosphere becomes intolerable--as, for instance, courts of justice,\r\nchurches, hotels, and hospitals. Under such circumstances, they are,\r\nindeed, a most valuable contrivance. But their application is entirely\r\noverdone; and there are persons who, even while they are sleeping, have a\r\nHindoo servant continually working the punkah, which, under such\r\ncircumstances, is usually worked from an adjoining room by means of silken\r\ncords, so that the motive power is not visible from the apartment, but\r\nonly the effect felt. Strangers at first find these artificial currents\r\nvery apt to superinduce headache, until continued residence makes him\r\nregard the punkah as a most necessary article of furniture.]\r\n\r\nLord Harris had taken measures for ensuring our proceeding direct from his\r\nresidence in Guindy Park upon the favourite excursion from Madras--that,\r\nnamely, to the Seven Pagodas. We had accordingly provided ourselves with\r\nonly what was indispensable in the way of luggage; and towards 1 A.M., we\r\nleft the ball-room, and proceeded on our way to the renowned Hindoo\r\nTemples to the south of Madras. A waggon conveyed us to the Adyar bridge,\r\nwhere a Government boat was in waiting for us, together with some Hindoo\r\nservants of the Governor, who were to be our guides to the Seven Pagodas.\r\nOne of these _peons_, as they are called in India, named Iritschapa,\r\npresented us with a document, in which he was commissioned to place\r\nhimself at our disposal during the whole period we were absent, and\r\nanticipate all our requirements without further authorization, to the best\r\nof his ability, so as to ensure our comfort and assist the objects we had\r\nin view. The Government boat was supplied with everything that could\r\nminister to our comfort, a second boat following us exclusively for the\r\nconveyance of our heavy baggage, personal effects, tents, and provisions.\r\nTowards 2 A.M., we embarked on the Eastern Coast Canal, which goes as far\r\nas Sadras, and by which we reached the Seven Pagodas, called also\r\nMahamalaipuram, the city of the Great or Holy Mountain, at 9 A.M.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOLY MOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\nThese singular and majestic specimens of architecture are about 3 miles\r\nfrom Sadras, being situated on the coast northwards, and about 500 paces\r\nfrom the canal. They consist of temples, grottoes, bas-reliefs, cisterns,\r\nstone-benches, and thousands of sculptures in long ranges of bas-reliefs,\r\nwhich afford an abundant store of antiquarian research. They go by the\r\nname of the Seven Pagodas (from _Baghavati_--Holy House, whence the\r\nEuropean corruption, Pagoda), from the circumstance, that there are, upon\r\nthe very brink of the ocean, seven temples hewn out of one piece of rock.\r\nThe Brahminical legends speak of an entire city having existed here, of\r\nwhich only the fragments are now washed by the sea. But, according to\r\nBabington's and Heber's minute researches in this neighbourhood,[107] there\r\nseems no doubt that there never existed any large city here, but that the\r\nwhole was a mere myth of the Brahmins, who procured a royal gift, an\r\nAgrabaram in this neighbourhood, and with subtle forethought left here a\r\ncaste of stone-cutters, who from time to time, under the guidance of their\r\npriests, executed these sculptures for the adornment of their sanctuary,\r\nwhich are justly the objects of wonder to their descendants. To this day,\r\neven, there dwell here certain families of stone-cutters, who work these\r\nsingular rocks as granite quarries, and make money by the trade. The Seven\r\nPagodas, specially so-called, are monolith temples, hewn on the spot out\r\nof massive blocks of rock. The mountain itself, a huge block of granite,\r\nto which the entire locality owes its reputation as a site of works of\r\nart, is covered, behind as well as in the front slope, with innumerable\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Benjamin Guy Babington. An Account of the Sculptures and\r\nInscriptions of Mahamalaipuram, illustrated by Plates I.-XVIII., in the\r\nTransactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain, London, 1819,\r\np. 258. Bishop Heber's Narrative, London, 1828, Vol. III., p. 216.]\r\n\r\nAfter our arrival, we made a hasty circuit through the place, so as first\r\nof all to be able to identify them, and be in a position to recognize the\r\nvarious sculptures and bas-reliefs cut out in the solid granite rock. The\r\ngreater number of the sculptures represent either the one or the other\r\ndescriptions of the Avatars (the incarnations or transfigurations) of\r\nVishnù, to whom the larger proportion of the temples is dedicated. In one\r\nof these temples, we perceived the god Vishnù in the fifth, or Dwarf\r\nIncarnation, in the course of which he had, under the guise of a\r\nBrahminical dwarf, begged of King Balitscha-Kravathi--who, by his piety,\r\nhad acquired so much power over the gods, that they had to transfer to him\r\nthe dominion of sea and land, and had in consequence waxed arrogant--as\r\nmuch soil as he could traverse in three steps! The wealthy Rajah made no\r\nobjection to complying with the apparently moderate request of the pigmy\r\nbeing before him. On the opposite wall of the temple we now see, in a\r\nlarge admirably executed bas-relief, how Vishnù, represented on this\r\noccasion with eight arms, at once embraced heaven and earth with his left\r\nfoot, and as there was thus no more room left for the next step, Vishnù\r\nreleased the haughty Rajah from his promise, on condition that he should\r\ndescend to the infernal regions. From this feat, Vishnù bears the name of\r\nTriwikrama and Tripadas (thrice-stepper).\r\n\r\nIn the next rock grotto we came to, we beheld the Life of Krishna, the\r\nshepherd-god, represented, first as tending his sheep, surrounded by cows,\r\ngoats frisking about, &c. Walter Elliot names this representation\r\n\"Krischna's Choultry,\" or the abode of the priests. The temple has a\r\nfrontage of 50 feet, is from 30 to 40 feet in depth, and has about twenty\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nFrom this spot, our guide, a Brahmin, brought us to what is called the\r\nGaneza Temple, a monolith Pagoda. When we expressed a wish to touch the\r\nface of Ganeza (a son of Siva), cut in stone and plentifully besmeared\r\nwith oil and lard, one of the Hindoo attendants hurried forwards to\r\nprevent us from being guilty of insult to this much-beloved divinity. The\r\ninscription to the right, in front of the niche in which Ganeza, hewn out\r\nof a single block of granite, is represented in a sitting posture,\r\nconsists of verses and prayers to Siva, written in Sanscrit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GOD GANEZA.]\r\n\r\nWe also remarked, on our way to the village, an ellipsoidal block of rock,\r\n68 feet in circumference, by 25 in height, which, from its very peculiar\r\nposition, seems to shift every moment, and presents a very extraordinary\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nAs we were proceeding to the beach, we came upon the Pagoda of\r\nKovulgobrom, which is at present in use (first constructed in the days of\r\nRajah Apatsch, 400 or 500 years since), situated on a large oblong plot of\r\nground, which is surrounded by a wall from 6 to 8 feet high. We were not\r\npermitted to cross the threshold of the pagoda, the door of which always\r\nstands wide open, and the minor apartments of which, so far as we could\r\ndiscern at a little distance away, were quite empty. We could just descry\r\na few sculptures on the walls.\r\n\r\nThe whole village contains at present about 400 inhabitants,[108] who\r\nreside in eighty small dwellings. Of these, three, built of bricks and\r\nwith tiled roofs, belong to the caste of Brahmins, thirty to the Pariahs,\r\nfive to families occupied in fishing, and two mere hovels of palm-wood to\r\nthe Willis, the lowest and most wretched caste of all. The families of\r\nstone-cutters reside outside the village. One remarks here that the walls\r\nof the houses are hidden by heaps of cow and horse-dung, which the\r\ninhabitants, as in Egypt, use for fuel, and which they pile up to dry\r\nagainst those of the walls which are most exposed to the sun. The _peon_\r\nof the settlement, by name Randghajaneik, a sort of overseer, gave us a\r\ndrawing of the various groups of houses, their inhabitants, and also the\r\nnames of the various castes in Tamil, engraved as usual with an iron tool\r\nupon palm-leaves, and very elegantly rolled up in a small envelope. Among\r\nthe customs and fashions of the inhabitants which attracted our notice, we\r\nwere informed that they always burn their dead from four to five hours\r\nafter life has departed--usually four hours and forty minutes--alleging\r\nthat the released soul takes that length of time to reach heaven! The\r\nbones are collected and thrown into the sea. Widows are no longer\r\nrequired, on the death of their husbands, to ascend the pyre with them.\r\nAccordingly, the mortality upon this score is small enough in\r\nMahamalaipuram. All seem hale and hearty, although for the most part they\r\nlive upon rice and fruits, tasting flesh but seldom, as it is never used\r\nby the Brahmin caste. The Brahmins will not even eat eggs, because they\r\nare the produce of hens; nor drink milk because it is procured from cows!\r\nThe girls generally marry at thirteen. They are, however, usually\r\nbetrothed from the time they are two or three years of age, the\r\nbridegroom-elect taking the bride-elect to reside with himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Of these inhabitants 50 belong to the Brahmin caste, 250 to\r\nthe Malabar, Sentù, and Siva castes, and 100 are Pariahs.]\r\n\r\nAll the natives whom we fell in with could read and write, but the\r\nSanscrit inscriptions on the rock-temples were quite unintelligible to\r\nthem, as they only spoke Tamil, Telùgu, and Malabar. The greater number\r\nhad their foreheads painted according to the caste they belonged to. Those\r\nworshipping Siva wore, suspended by a cord round the neck, small silver\r\namulets, called Lingams, which have images of Siva enclosed. The adherents\r\nof Brahma, as already mentioned, wear no distinguishing mark upon the\r\nforehead, except that those that are married wear a five-ply cord\r\n(_panul_), tied obliquely across the upper part of the body. One must not,\r\nhowever, attach too much faith to these varieties of external markings,\r\nsince many tattoo their foreheads with red, or yellow, or ashen-gray\r\npunctures, which usually have no special signification, but simply imply\r\nthat on account of the pressure of business requiring frequent absence,\r\nthey have neither time nor opportunity to have the distinguishing insignia\r\nof their caste properly designed. According to the natives, the yellow\r\ncolour is procured from the crushed, yellow-tinted root of the _Curcuma\r\nlonga_, (a species of spice), the red from the Cardomum (_Amomum repens_),\r\ncitron-juice, and red rice; while the white is prepared from common chalk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIVOUAC AT MAHAMALAIPURAN.]\r\n\r\nLord Harris had, with true Indian hospitality, made the most admirable\r\narrangements for our accommodation while at the Seven Pagodas. When, after\r\nour first survey of the locality, we came down to the beach, we found two\r\nlarge and two small tents ready pitched, and a number of men collected\r\nround a fire preparing our breakfast. But how great was our astonishment,\r\non entering the first tent, to find it spread with carpets, with an\r\nelegant sleeping-apartment with two large commodious bedsteads, and fitted\r\nup with all the usual necessaries for the toilette; while, in the passage\r\nwhich ran between the inner and outer walls of the tent, stood two immense\r\nbaths ready filled with soft water to reinvigorate our exhausted frames!\r\nEre we had recovered from our surprise, we were advised of the voice of\r\nthe Government Peon, apprising us that breakfast was served in the second\r\ntent. This was used exclusively as a dining and reception room, and was\r\nalso furnished with every conceivable appliance to promote our comfort.\r\nHis lordship was even so attentive as to send his own travelling canteen\r\nfor our use on the excursion. This tent, likewise, had double walls, with\r\na passage between; the exterior wall being lined with blue, by means of\r\nwhich the glare of the sun and of the blinding white sand was rendered\r\nless painful and more tolerable to the eye. A number of coolies were\r\nemployed in sprinkling water from time to time upon the fine-grained sand,\r\nwhich produced a most refreshing coolness all around. The Government Peon,\r\nas also the chief of police of the district, wore their best uniforms of\r\nwhite, with bran new bandoliers over their shoulders, of broad deep-red\r\nscarves, with gold-lace edgings, and, in the centre, a gilt plate, with\r\nthe words, \"Government Peon\" engraved on it. A number of men and children\r\nran hither and thither,--in a word, the whole village seemed in an uproar\r\nto see the strange gentlemen, and supply them with flowers, in the hope of\r\nreceiving some trifling present. At 12.30 P.M., the thermometer suspended\r\nwithin the tent marked 84° Fahr., although a gentle breeze was blowing\r\nfrom seaward through the fragrant luxuriant grass (_Kus-kus_, or\r\n_Vetiveyr_), which hung like a curtain over both entrances. It is an\r\nexceedingly happy idea to use this fragrant _Kus-kus_, (_Andropogon\r\nmuricatum_) in the manufacture of mats, which are intended to be suspended\r\nin the entrance-halls of houses, and to be sprinkled with water, whereupon\r\nthe penetrating, hot, parching wind is passed through the fine damp\r\ntexture, which thus at once tempers the heat, and fills the air with\r\nperfume.\r\n\r\nTowards 5 P.M., the heat having somewhat abated, we strolled to the Five\r\nPagodas, distant about one English mile from our encampment. The prevalent\r\ntree in this locality is the _Palmyra_ palm, which, though it does not\r\nboast the majestic proportions of the _Oreodoxia Regia_, or the cocoa-nut\r\npalm, presents, nevertheless, a very imposing appearance. Generally\r\nspeaking, however, the district is quite bare and destitute of trees; and,\r\nin short, like all the rest of this coast, has very much the appearance of\r\nthe flat coasts of Africa.\r\n\r\nOf the five monolith temples, four were dedicated to the brothers of\r\nVishnù, Dharma Rajah, Bimen, Nagulan, and Sawadewen, the fifth being\r\nexcavated in honour of Dubrotis, the consort of Dharma Rajah. The legend\r\nrelates that the four brothers lived in a state of Polyandry, or plurality\r\nof husbands, and had but one wife in common, who was a species of Amazon.\r\nAll these temples are tolerably sculptured, which, indeed, constitutes\r\ntheir chief claim to attention; but they are far from showing the artistic\r\nfinish of the bas-reliefs and sculptures, at what is known as the Holy\r\nMount.\r\n\r\nRhanganatha Swami, for instance, is the finest, though not the most\r\nimportant of these artificial grottoes. The sculptures here are\r\nincontestably the most highly-finished. The upper portion, to which access\r\nis obtained by some steps cut in the rock, rises above the huge granite\r\nblock, known as Jamapuram; the lower portion is a temple hewn out of one\r\npiece of rock, and with the most marvellously-executed allegories.\r\n\r\nAmong the reliefs on the north wall is perceived Donga, Siva's wife,\r\nriding on a lion (according to the natives, on a tiger), and bending her\r\nbow in conflict with Mahishasura, a giant with the head of a buffalo, who\r\nbrandishes a club. According to Elliot's interesting interpretation, this\r\nrepresents the contest between the matronly Amazon and heroine, Donga, the\r\nrepresentative of active virtue, and the bull-headed Mahishasura, the\r\npersonification of brute strength and animal passion. Over the head of\r\neither figure, a parasol, such as is used by the natives, is outspread,\r\ngiving a most grotesque appearance to the group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAS-RELIEF ON ONE OF THE MONOLITH TEMPLES.]\r\n\r\nThe relief on the southern wall represents a sleeping Vishnù\r\n(Rhanganatha), 9-1/2 feet high, apparently representing the idea of the\r\nCreation, as the serpent, Sescha, with its five heads, encircles his head.\r\nAt his feet one perceives two rajahs or princes, and one female figure, in\r\na praying attitude, with uplifted hands, only the bust being represented.\r\nIn one of the niches at Swami are two busts, life-size, of Siva, and his\r\nwife Paravathi, the latter holding an infant at the breast, his offspring\r\nSupramanión. Above this representation, and, like them, only showing from\r\nthe shoulder upwards, are represented on the right Brahma, on the left\r\nVishnù, each with four arms, symbolical of their power and dominion.\r\n\r\nThe superstructure of these rock sculptures is a sort of platform of loose\r\nstones accurately fitted to each other without mortar, so as to make an\r\nornamental whole. The interior is adorned with much more highly-finished\r\nspecimens of art, to view which, a large number of Hindoos, doing penance,\r\nannually climb, with great difficulty, into this part of the building, and\r\nmake their way into the unfinished interior apartments. While we were\r\ngiving free scope to our surprise at all we saw, we were greatly annoyed\r\nin our contemplations by the natives, who offered us bouquets of flowers,\r\nwreaths, and fruit. Also, a couple of flute-players (_Pulanpolen_) who\r\nwere passing, made their appearance to give us a specimen of their musical\r\nskill. One old man, of whom we procured a curious figure of Vishnù, neatly\r\ncarved in wood, as also several manuscripts, remarked that there was in\r\nthe neighbourhood, written upon Palmyra leaves, a manuscript, known as the\r\n_Istálam-purànam_ which gave the history of the Seven Pagodas, written in\r\nTamil.\r\n\r\nThe late president of the Madras Society, the learned Walter Elliot, who\r\nformed an extensive collection of the various valuable Hindoo manuscripts\r\nand inscriptions of Mahamalaipuram, and has partly published a\r\ntranslation of them,[109] told us afterwards, that this renowned Tamil\r\nManuscript consisted of nothing but fables, and did not give one single\r\nreliable particular as to the history of the Seven Pagodas.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: Journal of the Madras Literary Society, 1846, Nos. 30 and\r\n31.]\r\n\r\nIn Varaha Swami, one of the pagodas at present in use, and surrounded by a\r\nmodern walled cemetery, there is visible, on the exterior of the Temple,\r\nan inscription in Tamil, which is, however, utterly unintelligible to the\r\nnatives. This inscription, deciphered latterly by Babington, refers to a\r\ndonation to the pagoda by a sincere Hindoo believer, and gives the most\r\ncomplete detail, together with signature of the donor. The name\r\nMahamalaipur,[110] the \"City of the Sacred Hill,\" occurs frequently in it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Dr. Elliot writes Mamallaipuram; the natives call the place\r\nMahawalipuram, obviously a mere corruption of the customary mode of\r\nspelling.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of conversation with some of our Hindoo followers, we\r\nremarked that they made no difference between a \"kovül\" or praying-house,\r\nin which the divinities are never produced, but are guarded under lock and\r\nkey, and a pagoda, which is a residence of the gods, from which they can\r\nbe carried forth and afterwards brought back. Hence it is that a pagoda is\r\nmore readily accessible than a kovül, the sanctity of which it is\r\nforbidden him to violate.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, Mr. Elliot, by a private arrangement with the Brahmins, was\r\npermitted, on payment of Rs. 30 (£3), to break away the partition which\r\ndivided the inscriptions into two portions, in order to prepare three\r\ncopies, and have them translated by three Tamil scholars. One of these\r\ntranslators was the learned Tandavaraya Mudaliar, of Chingleput. The\r\ninscription contains the history of two donations, on the enlargement and\r\nlaying the foundation-stone of the temple, accomplished by the \"Kanattan\"\r\nof the village, and, lastly, a gift of 90 goats by the Siva Brahmin\r\nParamesvara-Mahavara, on the stipulation that a lamp should be kept\r\nconstantly burning in the temple: the whole dating from the year 1073. It\r\nresults from this interpretation that the inscription was put up towards\r\nthe end of the 11th century, thus supplying some clue to the age of this\r\nrock temple, which, according to Mr. Elliot's researches, does not exceed\r\na thousand years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO ONE OF THE TEMPLES.]\r\n\r\nTo this Vahara Swami, which seems to contain their whole history, the\r\nnatives wander regularly every morning, and sometimes two or three times\r\nduring the day, to offer flowers, cocoa-nuts, and other fruits. A flight\r\nof steps cut in the rock leads to the highest platform, whence there is an\r\nexcellent view over these monumental edifices.\r\n\r\nThat fancy has been called in to invest these unique unfinished sculptures\r\nwith the character of pleasure-grottoes, baths, &c., &c., of historical\r\npersonages, is readily intelligible. Thus, for example, the guide does not\r\nfail to point out to the stranger a sort of stone cistern hewn out of the\r\nsolid rock, traditionally reported to have been once the plunge-bath of\r\nDubrotis. This colossal basin has about 2-1/2 feet water during the rainy\r\nseason, which gradually evaporates, or is drawn off for use. The water,\r\ntinged with the yellow colour of the soil, leaves a mark behind on the\r\nstone sides, which naturally becomes very visible during the dry season.\r\nThis the natives maintain marks the height of the water as often as\r\nDubrotis, (Dharma Rajah's consort), bathed herself in it. Another similar\r\nblock of gneiss was transformed into a stone couch, and is called Dharma\r\nRajah's bed, at the upper end of which, near the head, a tiger is crouched\r\nto guard it. This gigantic ellipsoidal block of rock, which seems as\r\nthough balanced on a sharp point, could neither be displaced nor made to\r\noscillate by continued leaping. Some masses of rock piled up above the\r\ngrottoes were once Siva's kitchen, and so forth. All these spots, however,\r\nhave in reality not the slightest historic significance; it is only the\r\npresent generation that have tacked on to them legends, traditions, and\r\ninterpretations, which assuredly never were in the intention of the\r\nconstructors.\r\n\r\nOn a slope on one side of the mountain are a number of sculptures of\r\nremarkable beauty, representing the history of Tapasa, or the deep\r\npenitence of Ardschuna. On the right hand, close to the figure of the\r\npenitent Ardschuna, one perceives a multitude of people, two elephants as\r\nlarge as life and wonderfully finished, a tiger, and a figure, half woman\r\nhalf serpent. This relief, one of the finest we have seen, is a huge\r\nsculpture on the rock, 20 feet long by 30 in height, comprising hundreds\r\nof figures, with an idol in the centre, to which from all sides\r\nworshipping deities, men, and beasts, bow the knee in supplicatory\r\nattitudes; along the edge are elephants, life size, with their young. The\r\ncolour of the rock, somewhat resembling that of the animal, tends still\r\nmore to deceive the eye, and make the beholder doubt whether he is looking\r\nupon sculptures or upon living elephants. Elliot and others who have\r\ndescribed these rock temples, assign to them, as already mentioned, a\r\ncomparatively small antiquity. They are representations borrowed from the\r\npoem of Mahabharata, in the Hindoo mythology. The five roundish temples to\r\nthe south of the village are beyond all question the oldest of these\r\nmonuments. They are pagodas that have never been completed; solid, and\r\nhere and there showing marks of work, but only adorned externally, the\r\ninteriors being masses of unhewn granite; each of these temples is 30 feet\r\nin length by 20 in breadth and height. Thus far, the inscriptions have\r\nbeen ascertained to be in threefold characters, of which two are as yet\r\nundecipherable. Babington was the first to attempt to decipher them, or at\r\nall events to find the key by which to decipher them. The most important\r\nhas been copied and interpreted. But neither the inscriptions nor the\r\nvarious representations give the slightest historical clue as to the\r\nobject of these monuments. Taylor's researches seem to establish the fact,\r\nthat in the 17th century this district was inhabited by the Corumbas, a\r\nhalf-civilized race of the Dschaina religion. About this period, or a\r\nlittle later, in the reign of Abondai, one of the princes, whose capitals\r\nwere Conjeveran and Tripetty, the Brahmins were introduced to this\r\nneighbourhood. The extent of these works, however, their nature, and the\r\nimmense expense incurred, all point to a long-continued influence of the\r\nBrahmins. Most of these temples seem to have been first erected in the\r\n17th century, under Prince Sinhamanayadu, and Elliot assigns to several\r\neven a much later date.\r\n\r\nAs for the report of a smaller pagoda, of which only an old pyramidal\r\npagoda-stone is visible on the very edge of the sea, peering up from amid\r\nthe furious foaming surf, it seems to be altogether a myth, so that such\r\nenquirers as Ellis, Mackenzie, and Heber, making allowance for what Hindoo\r\ntraditions are known to be, will no longer take the trouble of searching\r\nfor any traces of the sunk pagoda, or of seeking to recover the ruins of\r\nthe submerged city. Several writers, indeed, are of opinion, that the sea\r\non the Cormandel coast is retiring; but this appears to be a mistake, for\r\nhere the sea seems encroaching rapidly, as is the case at Fort St. George,\r\nwhich 80 years ago was at some distance from the sea-shore, whereas its\r\nwalls are at present washed by the tremendous surf.\r\n\r\nBut the inroads of the sea could hardly have been so sudden and extensive\r\nas to have swallowed up an entire city, without leaving any traces. Not\r\none of the natives to whom we spoke in the place could say for certain,\r\nthat the sea had materially gained upon the land within the memory of man.\r\nNowhere are there any traces visible of the ruins of a city. One can\r\nsafely assert that there never existed such a city at Mahamalaipuram, but\r\nthat it has always been a mere abode of priests, with temples,\r\nsanctuaries, &c., without any more extensive settlement, similar to Copan,\r\nQuirigua, or Peten, in Central America, but altogether larger and more\r\nartistic, and evidencing a far higher culture on the part of the artist.\r\nThe supposed antiquity of the sculptures at Mahamalaipuram is too low, to\r\nadmit of our supposing that since their erection the greater part had been\r\nswallowed up in the sea. None of the sculptures that we saw belonged to\r\nany period (before the flood extended so far), whereas they are all\r\nsusceptible of explanation out of the modern Hindoo mythology, with the\r\naid of the Epic poems of Mahabharata, all referring to Vishnù and his\r\nworld of deities.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the _Novara_ expedition were visiting Mahamalaipuram, others\r\nmade out a trip to the Pulicat Lake, near the shore, northwards from\r\nMadras. About 40 or 50 miles on the road thither, the Neilgherries (or\r\nBlue Hills), with their jagged outline, came into view on the gray horizon\r\nto the N.W., the height of which may be about 1,500 to 2000 feet. A narrow\r\nbulwark or quay of unequal breadth, varying from 20 feet to 5 miles,\r\nseparates this salt lake from the ocean, the fierce surf of which, at some\r\nnarrow places, actually breaks over, and mingles its waters. The lake\r\nvaries in breadth, from 5 to 10 miles, and is about 60 to 70 miles long.\r\nThe level of its bed is so remarkably regular, never exceeding from 3 to 5\r\nfeet, that when the wind fails, the boats that navigate the lake can be\r\npushed along with poles, and one everywhere sees the naked inhabitants of\r\nthe coast standing in the very middle of the water, with their landing or\r\ndrag-nets, or busily occupied with rod and line! Being but a few hours\r\ndistant from Madras, the lake is connected with the city by an artificial\r\ncanal, along both sides of which are a number of outlets, carefully faced\r\nwith masonry, so as to convert the adjoining land into lagoons, in which\r\nduring the rainy seasons the strongly brackish water enters, and is used\r\nto make sea-salt.\r\n\r\nIn the canal there is considerable trade, as well by fishing-boats, as by\r\nthose laden with wood and fruit, which they convey to the city for\r\ndisposal. Most especially remarkable is the enormous number of fen-birds,\r\nwhich frequent its shores and all around it. At several places where the\r\nshores, for a width of about a mile, are mere swamps with barely a foot of\r\nwater, they are literally covered with myriads of curlews, which fly\r\nabout in flights of incredible numbers, and stretch out like clouds. Long\r\nrows of flamingoes stand, their bodies half bent to the earth, seeking\r\ntheir food in the mud; far as the eye can reach, one saw whole ranks of\r\nthese birds blending with storks, perched upon scattered stumps; while in\r\nthe water itself, vast flocks of sea-mews swam about, and the\r\nsea-swallows, in pursuit of their prey, flew to and fro in the air. As\r\nevening came on, the naturalists of the _Novara_ were sailing as though in\r\na sea of fire. Hundreds of fish, as they sprang out of the water, left a\r\nfiery wake behind them, like a rocket, while a flame-coloured\r\never-widening circle marked the spot at which they struck the water again.\r\nHundreds of various notes of birds, above, near, and round the boat,\r\nunited with the singular melancholy cry of the jackal, which resounded\r\nfrom the shore, while overhead flights of birds flew restlessly about in\r\nthe air, whirring in the ear like the rustling of disembodied spirits.\r\n\r\nFrom the lake, a short excursion was made to one of the artificial canals,\r\nwhich unite this basin of water at various points and in different\r\ndirections with the surrounding country, so as to get to the Strihoricotta\r\nForest, which supplies Madras with fuel. This consists of a sort of\r\nunderwood or brush, which grows again within the extraordinary short space\r\nof ten to twelve years. _Sisyphus vulgaris_ (_Rhamnea_), _Gardenia Ficus_,\r\ntamarinds, and several species of Mimosa, form the principal part of the\r\nforest, which is thickly grown with immense quantities of climbers. The\r\nwood is cut by the natives, who have constructed huts in the jungle, into\r\npieces of about 2 feet in length, which are transported in ox-carts to the\r\nshore, whence they are forwarded by boat to Madras.\r\n\r\nWhen the members of the _Novara_ Expedition had returned, greatly pleased,\r\nfrom their various excursions, the Madras Club gave a grand banquet in\r\nhonour of the captain and staff, to which the _élite_ of Madras society\r\nwere invited. Immediately on our arrival the managing committee of the\r\nclub had the courtesy to place the officers and scientific members of the\r\nExpedition upon the free list of the club during the ship's stay. The\r\nMadras Club-house, though not so luxurious or magnificent as the Clubs of\r\nLondon, fairly surpasses them in extent and commodiousness. It is, in\r\nfact, a small portion of the city in itself, in which one finds assembled\r\nall that can conduce to a comfortable, agreeable mode of existence;\r\nparlours, with wide arm-chairs and American rocking-chairs; reading-rooms,\r\nin which are all the best journals and an excellent assortment of the best\r\nand newest literature; dining apartments, in which one can dine in either\r\nthe English or French style; billiard-rooms, shower and plunge-baths, and\r\na large swimming-bath. Members from the country, or strangers, can be\r\naccommodated with lodging as well.\r\n\r\nAt the splendid banquet in honour of the Expedition, at which above 200\r\npersons sat down, the chair was taken by the Chief Justice Sir Christopher\r\nRawlinson--next to the Governor, the most influential person in the\r\ncommunity. The extremely friendly disposition manifested on that occasion\r\nfound its expression in toasts on all sides, which in few, but appropriate\r\nwords, welcomed the foreign guests; while, on the other side, they gave\r\nunmistakable evidence of the admiration and sympathy which the voyagers by\r\nthe _Novara_ carried away with them from the hospitable shores of\r\nMadras.[111]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: After the customary official toasts had been proposed by the\r\nchairman, and thanks returned by the Commander-in-chief of the Expedition,\r\nthe health was also proposed of the scientific staff, on which occasion\r\none of the naturalists present expressed his thanks for this honour, in\r\nhis name and that of his colleagues, in the following speech, which may be\r\npermitted to find a place here, as best showing with what impression the\r\nmembers of the Expedition left Madras.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,--It is not without some feeling of anxiety that I am rising,\r\nfor I have so many things to say, and yet it is but the thousandth part of\r\nwhat I, of what my fellow travellers all feel! Surely, it is always\r\nflattering to a man to be distinguished by his fellow-men; but such a\r\ndistinction becomes the more honouring if those who concur to distinguish\r\nhim are--as this is the case with you--a most estimable part of the\r\n_British_ nation! Of a nation, which has done more than any other on the\r\nglobe for the propagation of Christianity, the diffusion of knowledge, the\r\nadvancement of science, for the progress of civilization, industry, and\r\ncommerce. I do not intend, gentlemen, to return with the shiny currency of\r\nflattery the many proofs of attention and kindness which all the members\r\nof the Expedition have witnessed during our short, but most pleasant,\r\never-remembered stay in this city, the birth-place of hospitality! What I\r\nsay is but truth! Every page in modern history certifies my words! Which\r\nnation has done more for the propagation of Christianity among savage\r\ntribes all over the world? Some years ago, when I was rambling in British\r\nAmerica, and along the north shores of Lake Superior, I often found\r\nvillages of 300 or 400 Indians, and but one single white man amongst them.\r\nAnd who was that white man, who voluntarily shared their misery, their\r\nwants, and their privations? He was an _English missionary_!\r\n\r\n\"And again! Which nation has made greater and more serious efforts to\r\nsuppress the slave trade, and to abolish slavery in all countries where it\r\nstill exists, a shame to the nineteenth century?--Slavery! that hideous\r\nleprosy on the limb of the gigantic body, called the United States! Who is\r\neven now anxiously engaged to open, with the heartblood of its noblest\r\nsons, a vast empire--the Chinese kingdom--to civilization, to\r\nChristianity, to the traffic of all seafaring nations of the globe!\r\n\r\n\"And is not this very city, Madras, where we have been so heartily\r\nwelcomed, the best proof of the energy and perseverance of the political\r\nand commercial greatness of the British nation? Nothing but English\r\nsteadiness and English perseverance could succeed to build on this barren,\r\ninhospitable, and even most perilous coast, a vast, flourishing city,\r\nrivalling in size and the number of inhabitants the largest capitals in\r\nEurope! And what is still more pleasing and satisfactory, is the\r\nintellectual and physical condition in which one finds the Indians,\r\nespecially if compared with the condition of the natives in North and\r\nCentral America, &c. There he meets a population, rapidly dying away, in\r\nproportion as the axe of civilization is resounding from the backwoods.\r\nOne may almost determinate the day when the last of the red men will have\r\ndisappeared from the North American Continent, the land of his ancestors!\r\nHere in India, on the contrary, the traveller meets with a thriving,\r\nindustrious population. Who can see Hindoos, Malabar, Sentus, &c., occupy\r\nmost important employments at the observatory, at the telegraph offices,\r\nat the railroad, in any branch almost of the public service, and still\r\nbelieve the Hindoo race like the Indians of North America to be a _doomed_\r\npeople--to be a people that has no future? No, it HAS a future, and, under\r\nthe wise and humane government of the British Crown, I am sure the\r\ncoloured race of India will even have a most _glorious_ future!\r\n\r\n\"These are the impressions and feelings, gentlemen, with which we part\r\nfrom Madras, with which I and my scientific colleagues bid you all a most\r\nsincere and heartfelt farewell.\"]\r\n\r\nAs a number of our new-found friends expressed a wish, notwithstanding the\r\ndifficulties of getting out to, and back from the roads, to visit our\r\nship, the commodore invited some forty guests, shortly before our\r\ndeparture, to a \"tiffin\" on board. Although the frigate rolled pretty\r\nheavily, yet we, nevertheless, had the pleasure of the company of some\r\ntwenty gentlemen and ten ladies. After \"tiffin,\" which was served on the\r\npoop, under a tent improvised with flags for the occasion, all felt\r\nsufficiently comfortable to try a dance on the quarter-deck, our band of\r\nmusic being called into requisition for quadrilles, polkas, and waltzes;\r\nand, indeed, our guests paid so little attention to the approach of\r\nnight, that their return was postponed till it was absolutely dark, of\r\nwhich opportunity we gladly availed ourselves to light our pleasant guests\r\nhomewards with Bengal lights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.--TRACK FROM MADRAS TO THE NICOBAR ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nAt length, on 10th February, shortly after noon, we set sail. As the\r\nfrigate was perceived, from Fort George to weigh anchor, a thundering\r\nsalute was fired of 21 guns--an extraordinary honour and mark of\r\nattention, to which we responded by a similar salute. In consequence of\r\ncalms and light winds, we were 48 hours ere losing sight of land; and it\r\nwas not till the 12th February we could proceed on our voyage. For several\r\nevenings after, that magnificent, and as yet unexplained, phenomenon, the\r\nZodiacal light, which is conjectured by the greatest physicist of our age,\r\nto be the beams radiated from a vapour-like, flattened ring, revolving in\r\nthe space between the orbits of Mercury and Venus, was visible with much\r\nregularity. What was afterwards observed, however, of this remarkable zone\r\nof light, during the course of our voyage, will be found detailed in the\r\nmeteorological portion of the scientific volumes. Unbroken fine weather\r\naccompanied us during our entire voyage to the Nicobar Islands, our next\r\nstation. But although, as was rendered necessary by the climate so near\r\nthe Equator, we were clothed entirely in summer apparel, and there was\r\nnothing to remind us of its being winter and carnival at home, our sailors\r\ndid not let Shrove Tuesday pass over without celebrating that day, to be\r\nmarked with a white stone, by masking and dancing according to ancient\r\ncustom. Jack has an especially good memory for the return of such\r\njunketings, and is by no means prone to letting the sensible vicinity of\r\nthe Equator put him out of his reckoning; so he danced near the line also,\r\nnot because he had any pleasure therein, but because it has always been\r\nhis custom to do so at carnival-time!\r\n\r\nThe state of health of the ship's company was excellent, there being but\r\neight on the sick list, of whom only two were seriously ill.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd February towards 10 A.M. the Island of Kar-Nicobar hove in\r\nsight, and towards afternoon we found ourselves but a few miles distant.\r\nThe land seemed for the most part level, only a low eminence thickly\r\ncovered with frost rising towards the centre. The coast was overgrown with\r\ncocoa-nut-palm. In the N.W. and S.E. we could see three Malay boats at\r\nanchor. On the beach were some huts of beehive-like shape, in and out of\r\nwhich naked brown figures were seen moving; while, as night fell, numerous\r\nlights glimmered from the shore.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, Tuesday 23rd February, 1858, we anchored off the\r\nN.W. side of the island, in 14-1/2 fathoms coral sand, about 2 miles\r\ndistant from the shore, and just between the two villages of Mosse and\r\nSàui, each consisting of a few huts. One can approach within 3 or 4\r\ncable-lengths of the shore, where there are still 10 fathoms, with clay\r\nbottom. Several natives, some naked, some with their bodies covered in the\r\nmost ludicrous fashion with cast-off European clothes, approached the\r\nfrigate while she was being secured, in small but elegant canoes, and\r\ncalled out anxiously when within hailing distance, in an inquisitive tone\r\nand a broken English, \"No fear? good friend?\" which we interpreted into an\r\ninquiry as to whether they had anything to fear, and whether we were\r\ndisposed to be friendly. When, however, we did not immediately throw them\r\na rope to make fast their little canoes, and they got sight of our\r\nnumerous guns, they speedily turned tail and hurried away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARRIVAL AT KAR-NICOBAR.]\r\n\r\n                            END OF VOL.
