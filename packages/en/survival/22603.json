Our design\r\nhas been to make a shoe that any Army farrier can apply in a cold state\r\nwithout the use of any other tool than a knife to prepare the hoof, and\r\na hammer to drive the nails. Our success in this attempt has been so\r\ncomplete that we are now using the pattern designed especially for Army\r\nuse in all our contract work.\r\n\r\nThe shoe is rolled without a heel calk, so that the frog-pressure may be\r\nreadily secured without heating and drawing the iron:--the nail holes\r\nare punched so that the nail furnished by us with the shoe may be\r\ndriven, without the use of the pritchel to punch out the holes. The\r\nshoe, being made of the best quality of iron, may be bent cold to adapt\r\nit to the shape of the hoof.\r\n\r\nOfficers will at once see what a vast saving there is in the\r\ntransportation of shoes--requiring no forge with its heavy outfit--and\r\nwhich are less than half the weight of the clumsy old patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRATIONAL HORSE-SHOEING.\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nWILDAIR.\r\n\r\nWith Illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York:\r\nPublished by Wynkoop and Hallenbeck,\r\nNo. 113 Fulton Street.\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nEntered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873, by\r\nWynkoop & Hallenbeck,\r\nin the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn presenting the observations contained in the following pages, we are\r\naware that we appeal to practical men who judge by results, and have but\r\nslight patience with mere theory. We wish, therefore, to state clearly\r\nat the outset, that the system of horse-shoeing herein advocated, and\r\nthe shoe offered by us to accompany it and accomplish its purpose, are\r\nthe result of years of patient study of nature, and actual experiment;\r\nand that although we have had to contend with ignorance and interest on\r\nthe part of the farriers, and indifference and prejudice on the part of\r\nowners of horses, we have finally succeeded in interesting the most\r\npractical and capable men in America, England, and France in the\r\nmatter; and, at the time of this publication, thousands of horses,\r\nengaged in the most arduous labors of equine life--upon railways,\r\nexpress wagons, transfer companies, and other similar difficult\r\npositions--are traveling upon our shoes, their labors lightened by its\r\nassistance, their feet preserved in a natural, healthy state, and their\r\nlives prolonged to the profit of their owners and the advancement of\r\nthat cause--one of the evidences of the progress of our age in true\r\nenlightenment--which has for its beneficent object the prevention of\r\ncruelty to the dumb and helpless companions of our toil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first application of the Goodenough shoe is almost invariably to the\r\nfeet of horses suffering from some one of the forms of foot disease,\r\ninduced by the unnatural method of shoeing. Our system is intended for\r\nsound horses, to supply the necessary protection to the feet, and to\r\nkeep them in a healthy condition. Our rules for shoeing, embodied in our\r\ncircular of instructions, are applicable to sound horses, and disease\r\nmust be provided for as exceptional.\r\n\r\nMen are careless and, as a rule, unobservant; they go on in the old way\r\nuntil the horse flinches in action or stands \"pointing\" in dumb appeal to\r\nhis owner, telling with mute but touching eloquence of his tight-ironed,\r\nfeverish foot, the dead frog, and the insidious disease, soon to destroy\r\nthe free action characteristic of health. It is when this evidence brings\r\nthe truth home to him that the neglectful master, eager to relieve the\r\nanimal, tries our system. To such masters we must say, do not expect that\r\nthe imprudence and neglect of years can be remedied in an instant. The age\r\nof miracles long ago passed away. We do not propose to cure by formula,\r\nor bell and book. There is no \"laying on of hands\"--no magical touch of an\r\nenchanter's wand.\r\n\r\nRemember always that pain is the warning cry of a faithful sentinel on\r\nthe outpost, that disease is at hand. Disease is the punishment\r\nfollowing a violation of the laws of nature, and can only be escaped by\r\nrestoring natural conditions.\r\n\r\nRemember also, that \"Nature,\" so called by Hippocrates, the earliest\r\nsystematic writer upon medicine, never slumbers nor fails in duty, but\r\nstrives with unerring, active intelligence to prevent disease, or to\r\ncure it when it can not be prevented.\r\n\r\nWhen the measures and processes of the physician are in harmony with the\r\nnatural intention, disease may be cured; when they are adverse in\r\napplication, the patient dies, or recovers in spite of art.\r\n\r\nA great French philosopher powerfully remarked: \"Nature fights with\r\ndisease a battle to the death; a blind man armed with a club--that is, a\r\nphysician--comes in to make peace between them. Failing in that, he lays\r\nabout him with his club. If he happens to hit disease he kills disease;\r\nif he hits nature he kills nature.\"\r\n\r\nWe wish to be understood that in all things we would assist and\r\nfacilitate the action of nature, under the artificial restraints of the\r\nhorse. If we fail in this, or offer obstruction, our occupation is gone.\r\nThe world has no time to listen to our theory, no use for our practice.\r\nAnd we hope that the thoughtful readers of these pages will see in our\r\nintention, an earnest, honest purpose and belief, and that, without\r\naffectation of science or pretense of superior knowledge, we base all\r\nour efforts upon nature and common sense.\r\n\r\nIn following our instructions and attempting to use our method, _have\r\npatience_, and note the result from day to day. The horse will quickly\r\ntell you. His action will expose quackery and unmask pretension. He will\r\nbe no party to a fraud, no advocate of an advertisement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND HORSES.\r\n\r\nA sound horse is, after man, the paragon of animals. \"In form and moving\r\nhow express and admirable!\" His frame is perfect mechanism, instinct\r\nwith glowing life, and guarded by the great conservative and healing\r\npowers of nature from disease and death. His vitality is surpassed by\r\nthat of man, because man has the endowment of soul, and in his human\r\nbreast hope springs eternal and imagination gives fresh powers of\r\nresistance. Like man, the horse conforms cheerfully to all climates and\r\nto all circumstances. He is equally at home--\r\n\r\n    \"Whether where equinoctial fervors glow\r\n    Or winter wraps the polar world in snow.\"\r\n\r\nAmid the sands of Arabia his thin hide and fine hair evidence his\r\nbreeding; in the frozen north his shaggy covering defends him from the\r\ncold storms and searching winds. The disadvantages under which he will\r\nwork are in no way so clearly illustrated as in his efficiency when\r\nexposed to the evils of shoeing. Placed upon heel-calks, to slip about\r\nand catch with wrenching force in the interstices of city pavements, or\r\nloaded with iron-clogs, to give him \"knee-action\" and to \"untie his\r\nshoulders,\" he bravely faces his discomforts and does to the best of his\r\nability his master's will.\r\n\r\nHow quickly his active system responds to intelligent care and shows its\r\nbeneficial results! And when relieved from the abuses of ignorance, his\r\nrecuperative powers re-establish the springing step of youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nEVILS OF COMMON SHOEING.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery horseman finds his chief difficulty in the fact that he has to\r\nprotect the natural foot from the wear incident to the artificial\r\ncondition in which the horse is placed in his relation to man. In those\r\nimportant industries where great numbers of horses are used, and the\r\nprofit of the business depends upon the efficiency of the animal, the\r\nquestion becomes a very serious one, and the life term of the horse, or\r\nthe proportion of the number of animals that are kept from their tasks\r\nby inability, make the difference between profit and loss to the great\r\ntransportation lines that facilitate the busy current of city life. But\r\nnotwithstanding the importance of this subject, upon the score equally\r\nof economy and humanity, the world is, for the most part, just where it\r\nwas a thousand years ago, possibly worse off, for the original purpose\r\nof shoeing was only to protect the foot from attrition or chipping, and\r\nbut little iron was used, but, as the utility of the operation became\r\napparent, the smith boldly took the responsibility of altering the form\r\nof the hoof to suit his own unreasoning views, cutting away, as\r\nsuperfluous, the sole and bars, paring the frog to a shapely smoothness,\r\nand then nailing on a broad, heavy piece of iron, covering not only the\r\nwall but a portion of the sole also, thus putting it out of the power of\r\nthe horse to take a natural, elastic step.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the hoof, unbraced by the sole and bars, begins to\r\ncontract, the action of the frog upon the ground, which in the natural\r\nfoot is threefold--acting as a cushion to receive the force of the blow\r\nand thus relieve the nerves and joints of the leg from concussion,\r\nopening and expanding the hoof by its upward pressure, quickening the\r\ncirculation and thereby stimulating the natural secretions,--this all\r\nimportant part of the organization, without which there is no foot and\r\nno horse, becomes hard, dry, and useless. Then follows the whole train\r\nof natural consequences. The delicate system of joints inclosed in the\r\nhoof feel the pressure of contraction, the knees bend forward in an\r\nattempt to relieve the contracted heel. In this action the use of the\r\nleg is partially lost. The horse endeavors to secure a new bearing,\r\ninterferes in movement, or stands in uneasy torture.\r\n\r\nNature frequently seeks relief by bursting the dry and contracted shell,\r\nin what is known as quarter or toe crack, and the miserable victim\r\nbecomes practically useless at an age when his powers should be in their\r\nprime.\r\n\r\nEvery horseman will acknowledge that his experience has a parallel in\r\nthe picture here presented. Many men have at various times attempted\r\nreform, but the difficulty heretofore encountered has been that the\r\nmechanical application was in the hands, not of the owners and\r\nreasoners, but in those of a class of men who are, for the most part,\r\nignorant, prejudiced, and, consequently, apt to oppose any innovation\r\nupon the old abuses in which they have had centuries of vested right;\r\nand it was not until the studies of Mr. R. A. Goodenough that there were\r\nbrought to bear veterinary knowledge, mechanical skill, and inventive\r\nfaculty, to overcome the stolidity and interest which have been the\r\nlions in the way of true reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFROG PRESSURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat portion of the hoof called the \"frog,\" performs the most important\r\nvisible function in the economy of the movement of the horse. It is\r\nintensely vital and vigorous. The greater its exposure and the severer\r\nits exertion, the more strenuous is the action of nature to renew it. It\r\nis the spring at the immediate base of the leg, relieving the nervous\r\nsystem and joints from the shock of the concussion when the Race Horse\r\nthunders over the course, seeming in his powerful stride to shake the\r\nsolid earth itself, and it gives the Trotter the elastic motion with\r\nwhich he sweeps over the ground noiseless upon its yielding spring, but,\r\nif shod with heavy iron, so that the frog does not reach the ground to\r\nperform its function, his hoofs beat the earth with a force like the\r\nhammers of the Cyclops.\r\n\r\nWith the facility to error characteristic of the unreasoning, it has\r\nbeen one of the opinions of grooms and farriers that this callous,\r\nindia-rubber-like substance would wear away upon exposure to the action\r\nof the road or pavement, and it has been one of their cherished\r\npractices to set the horse up upon iron, so that he could by no\r\npossibility strike the frog upon the ground.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this violation of nature, they pare away the exfoliating\r\ngrowth of the organ, and trim it into the shape that suits their fancy.\r\n\r\nWithout action, muscular life is impossible, the portion of the body\r\nthus situated must die, paralyzed or withered. Motion, use, are the law\r\nof life, and the frog of the horse's hoof with a function as essential\r\nand well-defined as any portion of his body is subject to the general\r\nlaw. Without use it dries, hardens, and becomes a shelly excrescence\r\nupon a foot, benumbed by the percussion of heavy iron upon hard roads.\r\nThis is a loss nature struggles in vain to repair, the horse begins to\r\nfail at once. The elastic step, which in a state of nature spurned the\r\ndull earth, becomes heavy and stiff, and the unhappy brute experiences\r\nthe evils partially described in the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nTo restore the natural action of the foot by putting the bearing on the\r\nfrog, is the chief object of the system we advocate, and the Goodenough\r\nshoe is designed especially to provide for that first and last\r\nnecessity. If this is accomplished with a sound horse, he will avoid the\r\nthousand ills that arise from the usual method, and, so far as his feet\r\nare concerned, he will remain sound.\r\n\r\nIf the shoe is adopted as a cure for the unsoundness already manifested\r\nin animals that have been deprived of the proper use of their feet, it\r\nwill cure them, not by any virtue in the iron itself, nor by any magic\r\nin its application, but simply by giving beneficent nature an\r\nopportunity to repair the ruin that the ignorance of man has wrought\r\nupon her perfect handiwork.\r\n\r\nThis part of our subject is so important that we shall return to it\r\nagain in subsequent chapters, and enforce it at every point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOODENOUGH SHOE--FRONT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE GOODENOUGH SHOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the representation of the shoe in the cut, its peculiar\r\nconformation will be observed, and the reason for these changes from the\r\ncommon form we shall endeavor to explain as clearly as possible. In the\r\nfirst place, it is very light, scarcely half the weight of the average\r\nold-fashioned shoe. The foot surface is rolled with a true bevel, making\r\nthat portion of the web which receives the bearing of the hoof, the\r\nwidth of the thickness of the wall or crust. This prevents pressure upon\r\nthe sole, and makes the shoe a continuation of the wall of the foot. The\r\nground surface of the shoe has also a true bevel, following the natural\r\nslope of the sole, and bringing the inner part of the shoe to a thin\r\nedge. The outer portion is thus a thick ridge, dentated, or cut out into\r\ncogs or calks, allowing the nail-heads to be countersunk. This\r\narrangement gives five calks--a wide toe-calk, the usual heel-calks,\r\nand two calks, one on each side, midway between the toe and heel--thus\r\nputting the bearing equally upon all the parts of the foot.\r\n\r\nThis calking has a double object. In the common system of shoeing, to\r\navoid slipping in winter upon the ice, and in the cities upon the wet,\r\nslimy surface of pavement, or to assist draft, it is customary to weld a\r\ncalk upon the toe of a shoe, and to turn up the heels to correspond. In\r\nthis motion the horse is placed upon a tripod, his weight being entirely\r\nupon three points of his foot, and those not the parts intended to bear\r\nthe shock of travel or to sustain his weight. The position of the frog\r\nis of course one of hopeless inaction, and the motion of the unsupported\r\nbones within the hoof produce inflammation at the points of extreme\r\npressure, so that, in case of all old horses accustomed to go upon\r\ncalks, there is ulceration of the heels, in the form of \"corns,\" which\r\nthe smith informs the owner is the effect of _hard roads_ bruising the\r\nheel from the outside; he usually \"cuts out the corn,\" and puts on more\r\niron in the form of a \"bar shoe.\" Or the same action which produces\r\ncorns, acting upon the dead, dry, unsupported frog and sole, breaks the\r\narch of the foot so that a \"drop sole\" is manifest, or \"pumiced foot,\"\r\nfor both of which a \"bar shoe\" is the unvarying, pernicious\r\nprescription. In the Goodenough shoe, the calks are supplied, and the\r\nweight so distributed that the objection to the old method does not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTERSINKING THE NAILS.\r\n\r\nThis is a point to which we call attention as of great importance. In\r\nshoeing a horse for light or rapid work with a common flat shoe, seven\r\nor eight nail-heads protrude, and take the force of his blow on the\r\nground. The foot has just been pared, and those nails, driven into the\r\nwall and pressing against the soft inside horn and sensitive laminæ,\r\nvibrate to the quick, and often cause the newly-shod horse to shrink,\r\nand show soreness in traveling for a day or two. No matter how\r\nskillfully shod, the horse will be all the better in escaping this\r\nunnecessary infliction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEVEL OF THE FOOT SURFACE\r\n\r\nIs to keep the shoe a continuation of the crust or wall of the hoof, and\r\nto avoid percussion upon the sole.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEVEL ON THE GROUND SURFACE\r\n\r\nIs to follow the natural concavity of the foot and to give it the form\r\nwhich will have no suction on wet ground, will not pick up mud, or\r\nretain snow-balls.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALKS\r\n\r\nHave a use fully explained.\r\n\r\nWhen the shoe thus described is set so as to secure _frog-pressure_, as\r\nhereinafter directed, a horse may be shod without violation of nature's\r\nlaws; foot disease, under fair conditions, will become almost\r\nimpossible, and the useless refuse-stock, broken down by the old method,\r\nmay be restored to usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOODENOUGH SHOE--BACK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHOW TO SHOE SOUND FEET.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a foot came to the farrier in a perfectly normal condition, never\r\nhaving been subjected to the destructive process of common shoeing, the\r\ndirections for putting on the Goodenough shoe would be simply, to dress\r\nthe foot by paring or rasping the wall until a shoe of proper size laid\r\nupon the prepared crust would give an even bearing with the frog all\r\nover the foot; then, as the calk wore away, the pressure would come more\r\nand more upon the frog and the foot would retain its natural state\r\nduring the life-time of the horse.\r\n\r\nA colt thus shod could not have a corn, for a corn is an ulcer caused by\r\nthe wings of the coffin-bone pressing upon a hard, unelastic substance.\r\nWhen the horse raises his foot the coffin-bone is lifted upward by the\r\naction of the flexor tendon; when his foot touches the earth the weight\r\nof the animal is thrown upon the same bone, and, if unsupported by the\r\nnatural cushion of the foot, the action of the bone pressing the\r\nsensitive sole upon iron causes the bruise which, for lack of another\r\nname, is called a corn. The horse thus shod would never have a quarter\r\ncrack, for that is the immediate effect of contraction caused by the\r\nabsence of the expanding action of the frog and the consequent dead\r\ncondition of the hoof from want of circulation and proper secretions.\r\nThe horse would be equally free from \"drop\" and \"pumiced\" sole, seedy\r\ntoe, thrush, and kindred complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIPIENT UNSOUNDNESS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOOT, SHOWING SHOE AND FROG.]\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to find a horse perfectly sound in his feet,\r\nunless one looks (strange as it may seem) into the stables of the Third\r\nAvenue Railroad Company, or those of Adams' Express, or Dodd's Transfer\r\nCompany, or into some of the other stables where our shoe and system are\r\nin faithful use; we will therefore call attention to such a case as will\r\nbe generally presented at the forge: A good young horse, shod for\r\nseveral years upon the common plan, and in the early stages of\r\ncontraction. We find he has on wide-web shoes, weighing about twenty\r\nounces each; these may be smooth in front and calked behind; they bear\r\nupon the sole and heel. In place of a frog, we discover a point of hard,\r\nshrunken, cracked substance, neither frog nor sole. We cut the clenches\r\nand take off the relic of ignorance and barbarism, throwing it with\r\nhearty good-will into the only place fit to receive it--the pile of\r\nscrap-iron. We examine carefully to see that no stub of nail is left in.\r\nThe heels will be found long and hard. Our object being _frog-pressure_,\r\nto get the vivifying action of this tactile organ upon the ground, we\r\npare down the whole wall; we soon come to signs of a corn--perhaps a\r\ndrop of blood starts; but as we do not intend to put the weight upon the\r\nheels, we are not alarmed. Having cut all we can from the heels and\r\nstill finding that the frog, when the shoe is laid on, can not touch the\r\nground, _we knock down the last two calks and draw the heel of the shoe\r\nthin_; this must give us a bearing upon the frog and the sound part of\r\nthe foot. We use the lightest shoe, truly fitted with the rasp, not\r\nburned on. The horse should then be worked regularly, and he will\r\nexperience at once the benefit of a return to \"first principles\" and\r\nnatural action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOOT, WITH SHELL REMOVED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE CASES OF CONTRACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nContraction, in a greater or less degree, is exhibited by all horses, of\r\nevery grade, that have been shod in the common way, except in those more\r\nunfortunate cases that have resulted in a breaking of the arch of the\r\nfoot, from lack of the natural frog support, when the phenomena of\r\n\"dropped sole\" are found, and the usual accompaniment of \"pumiced feet.\"\r\n\r\nIt may seem superfluous to say that the power and action of the horse\r\nare greatly restricted by contraction.\r\n\r\nThe cartilaginous fibre that forms the bulk of the substance of the foot\r\nbehind the great back sinew is squeezed into narrow space, the working\r\nof the joints compressed, and inflammation at the joints, or at the\r\nwings of the coffin-bone, is excited; in worse cases navicular disease\r\nis established, or, from inadequate circulation, thrush holds\r\npossession at the frog, or scratches torment the heels.\r\n\r\nWhen simple contraction--shown in the narrow heel, dried and shrunken\r\nfrog, and \"pegging\" motion of the horse--is the case, our design is at\r\nonce to restore the natural action of the foot. This must be done by\r\nexpansion, and that is to be had from frog-pressure, according to the\r\ndirections in the preceding chapters. If navicular disease has\r\ncommenced, and the animal is decidedly lame, we have a difficult case.\r\nThe membrane of this important bone, in some cases of contraction,\r\nbecomes ulcerated, and the bone itself may be decayed, or adhesion\r\nbetween the coffin-bone and the navicular and pastern may take place.\r\nWithout expansion there is no possibility of relief; local bleeding,\r\npoulticing, and all the drastic drugs of the veterinary will be invoked\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARTER AND TOE CRACK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUARTER CRACK--FULL SHOE.]\r\n\r\nThis disease, usually attributed to \"heat,\" \"dry weather,\" \"weak feet,\"\r\netc., is one of the common symptoms of contraction, and can be\r\nentirely cured with the greatest ease; nor will it ever recur if the\r\nhoof is kept in proper condition.\r\n\r\nIf the case is recent, shoe as advised in our paragraph upon \"Incipient\r\nUnsoundness,\" being sure to cut the heel well down, putting the bearing\r\nfully upon the frog and three-quarters of the foot. If the hoof is weak\r\nfrom long contraction and defective circulation, lower the heels and\r\nwhole wall, until the frog comes well upon the ground, and shoe with a\r\n\"slipper,\" or \"tip,\" made by cutting off a light shoe just before the\r\nmiddle calk, drawing it down and lowering the toe-calk partially. This\r\nwill seem dangerous to those who have not tried it, but it is not so.\r\nThe horse may flinch a little at first, from his unaccustomed condition,\r\nand from the active life that will begin to stir in his dry, hard, and\r\nnumb foot, but he will enjoy the change. The healing of the crack will\r\nbe from the coronet down, and it is good practice to cut with a sharp\r\nknife just above the split, and to clean all dirt and dead substance out\r\nfrom the point where you cut, downwards. Soaking the feet in water will\r\nfacilitate a cure by quickening the growth of the hoof; or, a\r\nstimulating liniment may be applied to the coronet, to excite more\r\nactive growth. Bear in mind that expansion is not from the sole upwards,\r\nbut from the coronet downwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOE CRACKS.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this defect is the same as in quarter crack. It appears in\r\nboth fore and hind feet. Clean the crack well, cutting with a sharp\r\nknife the dead horn from each side of it; shoe as advised for quarter\r\ncrack, or for the purpose of getting expansion and natural action of the\r\ndead, shelly hoof. The dirt and sand may be kept out of the crack by\r\nfilling it with balsam of fir, or pine pitch. Keep the horse at regular\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUARTER CRACK--HALF SHOE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDROP SOLE AND PUMICED FOOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis miserable condition of the abused animal is Nature's fiercest\r\nprotest against the ignorance and carelessness of man. A horse set upon\r\nheavy shoes, and those armed with calks at toe and heel, such as are\r\nusually inflicted upon large draft-horses, has his whole weight placed\r\nupon the unsupported sole. The frog never comes in contact with the\r\nearth in any way, inflammation of the sensitive frog and sole takes\r\nplace, and the arch of the sole bends down under the pressure until the\r\nground surface of the hoof becomes flat or convex, bulging down even\r\nlower than the cruel iron that clamps its edge. This is the condition of\r\na drop sole. This degenerate state of the foot has other complications.\r\nActive inflammation is often present and all the wretchedness of a\r\npumiced foot--the despair of owner and veterinary--is experienced. The\r\nsmith, whose clumsy contrivance has been the cause of all the woe, has\r\nabundant reasons to offer for the disease, and his unfailing resort of\r\nthe \"_Bar Shoe_.\" This atrocious fetter is supplemented with leather\r\npads, sometimes daubed with tar, and the horse hobbles to his task. Not\r\nunfrequently the crust at the front of the hoof sinks in, adhering to\r\nthe sole; circulation being cut off,\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDY TOE\r\n\r\nis then manifest.\r\n\r\nThe only possible relief from these complications is in natural action.\r\nContraction is not present, but we want circulation, new growth and\r\nabsorption; we obtain it by dressing the foot smoothly with the rasp and\r\nputting the bearing evenly upon the frog and a light shoe, which should\r\nbe merely a continuation of the wall of the foot. Many very bad cases\r\nshod in this way have been relieved. No grease or tar should ever be\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACTION, OR DROP SOLE, WITH SORENESS AT THE TOE.\r\n\r\nShoe as previously directed, and rasp or cut the sole and wall at the\r\ntoe into a slightly hollow shape, so that you could pass a knife-blade\r\nbetween the hoof and shoe. The object of this is to relieve the hoof\r\nfrom pressure at this point. In cases where the toe is thin and weak, or\r\nwhere there is inflammation extending to the point of the frog, remove\r\nas much of the sole pressing against the frog as seems feasible, and\r\nlevel the toe-calk, so that the horse will bear upon the frog and\r\nside-calks.\r\n\r\nIt is often well to free a shrunken frog from the binding growth of sole\r\nthat has closed in upon it, and in cases of contraction, where this is\r\ndone, a horse will recover the action of the frog with less difficulty\r\nthan where that organ is sole-bound.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRUSH.\r\n\r\nThis is a filthy, fetid disease of the frog. By many veterinary writers\r\nit is attributed entirely to damp stables, general nasty condition of\r\nstall, yard, etc. Mayhew ingenuously remarks, in addition, that it is\r\nusually found in animals that \"step short or go groggily,\" and that the\r\nhoof is \"hot and hard.\" Youatt comes to the point at once in saying that\r\nit is the effect of contraction, and, when established, is also a cause\r\nof further contraction. It is manifest in a putrid discharge from the\r\nfrog. The matter is secreted by the inner or sensible frog, excited to\r\nthis morbid condition by pressure of contraction. Its cure is simple and\r\neasy if the cause is removed. A wash of brine, or chloride of zinc,\r\nthree grains to the ounce of water, is generally used to correct the\r\nfoulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBENT KNEES INTERFERENCE, AND SPEEDY CUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knee of a horse is a most complicated and beautiful mechanical\r\narrangement, singularly exempt from strain or disease in any form. Bony\r\nenlargement, inflammation of the ligaments, do not attack it. The ravage\r\nof the shoeing-smith--the horse's direst enemy--seems to be exhausted\r\nupon the feet and the sympathetic pasterns; the concussion of iron and\r\npavement, uncushioned by the frog, will destroy the lower system of\r\njoints before the knee can be shaken.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this perfection and strength, many horses bend the knee,\r\nand stand, or travel with it bent, until the flexor muscles shrink from\r\nlack of use. This \"over in the knees\" condition is invariably caused by\r\nimperfect use of the feet. The effect of heel-calks and their\r\naccompaniment of corns, making a sore in each heel, is often indicated\r\nby the horse to his regardless owner by bending his knee. The owner\r\nasks the smith why he does it, and the smith, who never fails to give a\r\nreason, says he has always noticed that horse had \"weak knees.\" We know\r\nof a shoer in Worcester County, Massachusetts, who has a wide local\r\nreputation for \"doctoring\" weak knees. He holds that the muscles of the\r\nleg in such cases are _too short_, and have to be lengthened with thick\r\niron heels and calks. It is a favorite theory of this class of shoers\r\nthat they are able to correct the errors of Providence in the horse's\r\nconstruction, and piece him out with heel-calks and bar-shoes!\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERFERING AND SPEEDY CUT.\r\n\r\nIf horses were not shod, they would not interfere; it therefore follows\r\nthat shoeing is the cause of this defect. A contracted hoof, pain from\r\ncorns, or any inflammation causes a horse to seek a new bearing. In\r\ndoing this he strikes himself. Blacksmiths make \"interfering shoes,\"\r\nwelding side-pieces and superfluous calks upon their clumsy\r\ncontrivances, and sometimes succeed in preventing the symptom, but they\r\nnever remove the cause. Few horses with natural feet, good circulation,\r\nand shod with a light shoe, will ever interfere. In all such cases, take\r\noff the heavy shoe, cure the contraction, get an even bearing, and let\r\nnature have at least a momentary chance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING UP HORSES.\r\n\r\nIt is a common practice of large proprietors, engaged on railroad or\r\ncity work, to buy up horses with unsound feet, unfitted for speed or\r\ngentle service, and use them up, as old clothes are put through a\r\nshoddy-mill for what wool there is left in them. This cruel policy,\r\nunder an intelligent system of shoeing, would be impossible, because the\r\nvast aggregate of foot diseases would be so abated that horses, sound in\r\ngeneral health but creeping upon disabled hoofs, could not be found in\r\ndroves, as at present, and the speculator in equine misfortune would\r\nbetter serve his selfishness by buying young horses and keeping them\r\nsound by a natural system of shoeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUMBLING HORSES.\r\n\r\nThis annoyance is frequently caused by undue use of the toe, when the\r\nheel is lame and sore from contraction and corns. When the horse has the\r\nfrog well on the ground and uses his heel without shrinking he is not\r\napt to stumble.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO INCREASE COMFORT.\r\n\r\nIn dry weather, or when a horse with a hard, lifeless hoof is shod with\r\nthe Goodenough shoe, and shrinks from the unaccustomed pressure of the\r\nfrog on the ground, nothing is so grateful to his feet as cold water.\r\nThe hose turned on them is a delicious bath; or if he can stand for an\r\nhour in a wet place, or in a running brook, he will get infinite comfort\r\nfrom it. We have sometimes rapidly assisted the cure of contraction, in\r\nthe city, by manufacturing a country brook-bottom in this simple way:\r\nPut half a bushel of pebbles into a stout tub, with or without some\r\nsand, let them cover the bottom to the depth of two or three inches,\r\npour on water and you have a good imitation of a mountain brook. Put\r\nthe horse's forefeet into this, and let him bear his weight upon the\r\nfrog. The first time he will grow uneasy after a few minutes, but when\r\nhis frog becomes natural in its function he will be glad to stand there\r\nall day.\r\n\r\nDo not carry this treatment to excess. Moderation is the most\r\nsatisfactory course in all things. Abjure utterly all oils and greasy\r\nhoof dressings, they are pernicious recommendations of unreasoning\r\ngrooms. They fill the pores of the wall, and injure in every way. Nature\r\nwill find oil, if you will allow circulation and secretion, through the\r\naction of the frog.\r\n\r\n\"Stuffing the feet,\" is another wretched, groom's device. A horse has a\r\ndry, feverish hoof from contraction, so his hollow sole, denuded of its\r\nfrog, is \"stuffed\" with heating oil-meal, or nasty droppings of cows.\r\nWhen this sort of thing is proposed, remember _Punch's_ advice to those\r\nabout to be married, \"Don't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nECONOMY OF THE GOODENOUGH SHOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA horse-shoe that the united voices or the shrewdest and ablest managers\r\nin the country commend--inasmuch as it enables cripples to work,\r\nfrequently restores them, and maintains soundness where that quality\r\nexists--need not be recommended on the ground of economy. Such a\r\nhorse-shoe could not be dear. But it takes all sorts of people to make a\r\nworld, and the pressure to the square inch of mean men is not to be\r\ngoverned by safety-valves or regulated by gauges. There are too many men\r\nwho will use the thing that costs the least outlay, even if it tortures\r\nor kills the horse. On the point of first cost we may say that if our\r\nshoe had no advantage over the hand-made shoe in preserving the natural\r\naction and growth of the foot, thereby retaining the powers of the\r\nanimal in full vigor, it would still be cheaper than the common shoe. It\r\nis sold slightly higher than the clumsy pieces of bent iron called\r\nhorse-shoes by mere courtesy, and its lightness gives one-third more\r\nshoes to the keg, while there is no expense of calking, which, in labor\r\nand material, is equal to three cents per pound. Upon the point of\r\ndurability, it is well settled that the heavy shoe will not last so long\r\nas the light one with frog-pressure. A horse set upon heavy shoes grinds\r\niron every time he moves. The least interposition of the frog will\r\nreduce the wear very materially, and if the frog is well on the ground,\r\na horse will carry a shoe until he outgrows it.\r\n\r\nA horse-railroad superintendent said to the writer, \"We don't wear iron\r\nnowadays, we wear _frog_ and _cobble-stones_; nature provides frog and\r\nBoston finds cobble-stones.\" When the Goodenough shoe is put for the\r\nfirst time upon a dry, half-dead foot, and the frog brought into lively\r\naction, growth is generally very rapid. We have often been compelled to\r\nreset the shoe, cutting down the wall, in ten days after shoeing. Many\r\nhorses that have been used upon pavements and horse-railroads, have\r\nacquired a habit of slipping and sliding along, catching with heel-calks\r\nin the space between the stones; such horses do not at once relinquish\r\nthe habit, and wear their first set of our shoes much more rapidly than\r\nthe subsequent set, after they have assumed the natural action of their\r\nfeet. But, economical as a light shoe that will long outlast a heavy one\r\nmay be, the great saving is in the item of horse-flesh.\r\n\r\nThe value of the horses employed in the actual labor of the country\r\nreaches a startling sum total.\r\n\r\nThe vast importance of the horse in the movement of business, was never\r\nso fully understood and deeply felt as during the year past, when the\r\nepizoötic swept over the continent, paralyzing all movement and every\r\nform of human industry. Even the ships that whiten the seas would furl\r\ntheir sails and steamers quench their fires but for the labors of the\r\nhorse. During the epidemic the canal-boats waited idly for their patient\r\ntow-horses and railroads carried little freight; the crops of the West\r\nlay in the farmers' granaries and the fabrics of the Eastern loom and\r\nvaried products of mechanical industry crowded the warehouses; even the\r\nragpicker in the streets suspended his humble occupation, for the\r\nmerchant, unable to transport rags, refused to buy them of the gatherer.\r\nThe investment of national wealth in horses being so enormous, any means\r\nthat adds to the efficiency of the horse greatly enhances the general\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERFECT SHOE AND HOOF.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPERFECT SHOE AND HOOF.]\r\n\r\nIt is an old English saying, that \"a good horse will wear out two sets\r\nof feet.\" The meaning of this adage is obvious: a good horse's feet are\r\nuseless at the time when his other powers are in the prime. Mr. Edward\r\nCottam, of London, in his \"Observations upon the Goodenough System,\"\r\nstates that London omnibus-owners use up a young horse in four years;\r\nthat is, a horse of seven years of age goes to the knackers at eleven,\r\n_pabulum Acherontis_; and the only noticeable cause of their failure is\r\nfrom diseases of the feet. A horse properly shod and cared for should\r\nendure five times as long. In this country horses fail in the feet, and\r\nare called old at an age when they should be in the fullest activity.\r\nThis is a double loss, for every horseman of experience knows that if an\r\nold horse is sound and vigorous he has some great advantages over a\r\nyoung one. He is safer in every respect, \"way-wise,\" seasoned, steady,\r\nand reliable. He and his owner are old friends and companions and can\r\nnot part but with a pang of regret. A good horse, well cared for, should\r\nwork cheerfully until he is thirty years of age; yet how few are able to\r\nperform genteel service after fifteen! It is a sad sight that of the\r\nhigh-mettled, noble animal, once the petted darling of wealth, caressed\r\nby ladies and children, and guarded so that even the winds of heaven\r\nmight not visit him too roughly, fallen through the successive grades of\r\nequine degradation, until at last he hobbles before a clam-wagon or a\r\nswill-cart--a sorry relic of better days.\r\n\r\nThe question is so plain that we hesitate to argue with intelligent\r\npeople to prove that, if the old system of shoeing destroys the value of\r\na horse in middle life, half his money value is sacrificed to\r\nignorance--a waste that might be saved were nature's laws regarded. That\r\npart of the argument which demands that the faithful, devoted servant\r\nmerits humane treatment and the best intelligence of the master in\r\nsecuring his health and comfort can not be forgotten and need not be\r\nurged upon the attention of the true horseman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be _rational_ in any course of action is, primarily, to follow the\r\nleading of reason, and by that guidance to arrive at correct\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nIt is the opposite to the method which is _irrational_--regardless of\r\nreason, and therefore leading to conclusions erroneous and absurd.\r\nRationalism is opposed to ultraism, to vehement, officious and extreme\r\nmeasures--while it would seek more excellent ways, it holds fast to that\r\nwhich is good.\r\n\r\nRationalism in medicine is the method which recognises nature as the\r\ngreat agent in the cure of disease, and employs art as an auxiliary to\r\nbe resorted to when useful or necessary, and avoided when prejudicial.\r\n\r\nIn our treatment of the hoof, we would seek to know the cause of the\r\nhorse's troubles, firmly believing that he is endowed by nature with\r\nstrength to perform the service man demands of him, and that he is not\r\nnecessarily a helpless prey to torturing diseases of the minor organs;\r\nand, indeed, subject only to that final, unavoidable sentence, which in\r\nsome form nature holds suspended over all animate existence.\r\n\r\nHaving by the aid of reason ascertained the cause of defects, we would\r\nassist nature to relieve them; we have therefore called this little\r\nhand-book of suggestions from our experience, RATIONAL HORSE-SHOEING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPOSING FORCES.\r\n\r\nHaving taken upon ourselves to reform evils, rooted deep in old customs,\r\nand to abolish abuses older than our civilization, we have to meet with\r\ndiscouragement and opposition in various forms.\r\n\r\nEven the enlightened and well-intentioned hold back incredulous. This\r\nform of opposition finally examines, being led thereto from motives of\r\neconomy and the promptings of humanity; it usually approves and\r\nassists, but is often carried back by indolence, when it discovers that\r\nit must join us in the loud battle we are forced to wage all along the\r\nline against fierce interests and bitter prejudices.\r\n\r\nWe attack with slender array, but unflinching purpose, the gloomy powers\r\nof ignorance that are allied to doubt and indifference. These contend\r\nunder the prestige of a thousand years of possession.\r\n\r\nIgnorance and Prejudice are twin giants that renew their life upon each\r\nother; they are as old as chaos, and are invulnerable to the weapons of\r\nordinary warfare. Like the fallen angels, they are--\r\n\r\n          \"Vital in every part,\r\n    And can but by annihilation die.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the Greek fables, typifying the struggle of man against\r\ncircumstances, was a story of the battle between Hercules and Antæus,\r\nson of the Earth. The fight was long and doubtful, for whenever the\r\nmortal was felled to the ground by the power of the vigorous god, his\r\nforce was renewed by contact with the breast of his mother Earth, and\r\nhe sprang to his feet and recommenced the never-ending strife.\r\n\r\nThis contest between the god, and the mortal born of earth and sea, is\r\nthe poetical type of the unceasing toil of man in the Valley of the\r\nNile, against the sandy waves of the Lybian desert, always encroaching\r\nupon the cultivated soil, and demanding year by year new exertions to\r\nrepress their advance.\r\n\r\nSo, in our attempt to establish a better system of utilizing the powers\r\nof the horse in the service of man, we have each day to meet the same\r\nenemy, renewed by contact with the sources that foster and reinforce\r\nignorance. But as persistent labor conducted the beneficent waters of\r\nthe Nile in irrigating channels through the arid plain of the desert,\r\nuntil upon the inhospitable edge gardens bloomed, fields of grain waved\r\nin the breeze, and the date-palm cast its grateful shade upon the\r\nhusbandman--so we make healthful progress, and enjoy a widely increasing\r\ntriple reward--first, in the thankful esteem of our fellow men;\r\nsecondly, in the relief we afford to a noble animal; and last, in the\r\nsubstantial return which the highest authority has adjudged to honest\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR WORK.\r\n\r\nWe wish all readers of this book to understand that the directions\r\nherein given for shoeing apply to horses whose owners expect them to\r\nwork regularly after shoeing--from the very hour in which the shoes are\r\nset.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to \"lay up\" horses, or to put them to rest in \"loose\r\nboxes,\" nor yet to \"turn them out to grass.\" One of the chief\r\ndifficulties we have had with wealthy owners has been from the tendency\r\nto keep the horse _out of work_ when we have got him into a condition\r\nwhere we want exercise to stimulate the alterative process we propose.\r\n\r\nA cure of any foot disease we have described, will be much more rapidly\r\neffected if the horse has his regular work upon the roads or pavements\r\nto which he is accustomed, no matter how hard they are.\r\n\r\nWe hope that it has also been noticed, that we do not propose to cure\r\nspavins, splints, navicular disease, or to restore the natural action\r\nof a horse where ossification of cartilage is well established.",
