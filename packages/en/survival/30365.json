Have you\r\never heard of the Mahdi?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard that he is ugly and naughty.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy smiled compassionately.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know whether he is ugly. The Sudânese claim that he is\r\nhandsome. But the word 'naughty' about a man who has murdered so many\r\npeople, could be used only by a little girl, eight years old, in\r\ndresses--oh--reaching the knees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Papa told me so and papa knows best.\"\r\n\r\n\"He told you so because otherwise you would not understand. He would\r\nnot express himself to me in that way. The Mahdi is worse than a whole\r\nshoal of crocodiles. Do you understand? That is a nice expression for\r\nme. 'Naughty!' They talk that way to babes.\"\r\n\r\nBut, observing the little girl's clouded face, he became silent and\r\nafterwards said:\r\n\r\n\"Nell, you know I did not want to cause you any unpleasantness. The\r\ntime will come when you will be fourteen. I certainly promise you that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" she replied with a worried look, \"but if before that time the\r\nMahdi should dash into Port Said and eat me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi is not a cannibal, so he does not eat people. He only kills\r\nthem. He will not dash into Port Said, but even if he did and wanted to\r\nmurder you, he would first have to do with me.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration with the sniff with which Stas inhaled the air through\r\nhis nose, did not bode any good for the Mahdi and considerably quieted\r\nNell as to her own person.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she answered, \"you would not let him harm me. But why do they\r\nnot allow Fatma to leave Port Said?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Fatma is a cousin of the Mahdi. Her husband, Smain, made an\r\noffer to the Egyptian Government at Cairo to go to the Sudân, where the\r\nMahdi is staying, and secure the liberty of all Europeans who have\r\nfallen into his hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Smain is a good man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait! Your papa and my papa, who knew Smain thoroughly, did not have\r\nany confidence in him and warned Nubar Pasha not to trust him. But the\r\nGovernment agreed to send Smain and Smain remained over half a year\r\nwith the Mahdi. The prisoners not only did not return, but news has\r\ncome from Khartûm that the Mahdists are treating them more and more\r\ncruelly, and that Smain, having taken money from the Government, has\r\nbecome a traitor. He joined the Mahdi's army and has been appointed an\r\nemir. The people say that in that terrible battle in which General\r\nHicks fell, Smain commanded the Mahdi's artillery and that he probably\r\ntaught the Mahdists how to handle the cannon, which before that time\r\nthey, as savage people, could not do. But now Smain is anxious to get\r\nhis wife and children out of Egypt. So when Fatma, who evidently knew\r\nin advance what Smain was going to do, wanted secretly to leave Port\r\nSaid, the Government arrested her with the children.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what good are Fatma and her children to the Government?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Government will say to the Mahdi,--'Give us the prisoners and we\r\nwill surrender Fatma'--\"\r\n\r\nFor the time the conversation was interrupted because the attention of\r\nStas was attracted by birds flying from the direction of Echtum om\r\nFarag towards Lake Menzaleh. They flew quite low and in the clear\r\natmosphere could be plainly seen some pelicans with curved napes,\r\nslowly moving immense wings. Stas at once began to imitate their\r\nflight. So with head upraised, he ran a score of paces along the dyke,\r\nwaving his outstretched arms.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" suddenly exclaimed Nell. \"Flamingoes are also flying.\"\r\n\r\nStas stood still in a moment, as actually behind the pelicans, but\r\nsomewhat higher, could be seen, suspended in the sky, two great red and\r\npurple flowers, as it were.\r\n\r\n\"Flamingoes! flamingoes! Before night they return to their haunts on\r\nthe little islands,\" the boy said. \"Oh, if I only had a rifle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should you want to shoot at them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Girls don't understand such things. But let us go farther; we may see\r\nmore of them.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this he took the girl's hand and together they strolled towards\r\nthe first wharf beyond Port Said. Dinah, a negress and at one time\r\nnurse of little Nell, closely followed them. They walked on the\r\nembankment which separated the waters of Lake Menzaleh from the Canal,\r\nthrough which at that time a big English steamer, in charge of a pilot,\r\nfloated. The night was approaching. The sun still stood quite high but\r\nwas rolling in the direction of the lake. The salty waters of the\r\nlatter began to glitter with gold and throb with the reflection of\r\npeacock feathers. On the Arabian bank as far as the eye could reach,\r\nstretched a tawny, sandy desert--dull, portentous, lifeless. Between\r\nthe glassy, as if half-dead, heaven and the immense, wrinkled sands\r\nthere was not a trace of a living being. While on the Canal life\r\nseethed, boats bustled about, the whistles of steamers resounded, and\r\nabove Menzaleh flocks of mews and wild ducks scintillated in the\r\nsunlight, yonder, on the Arabian bank, it appeared as if it were the\r\nregion of death. Only in proportion as the sun, descending, became\r\nruddier and ruddier did the sands begin to assume that lily hue which\r\nthe heath in Polish forests has in autumn.\r\n\r\nThe children, walking towards the wharf, saw a few more flamingoes,\r\nwhich pleased their eyes. After this Dinah announced that Nell must\r\nreturn home. In Egypt, after days which even in winter are often\r\nscorching, very cold nights follow, and as Nell's health demanded great\r\ncare, her father, Mr. Rawlinson, would not allow her to be near the\r\nwater after sunset. They, therefore, returned to the city, on the\r\noutskirts of which, near the Canal, stood Mr. Rawlinson's villa, and by\r\nthe time the sun plunged into the sea they were in the house. Soon, the\r\nengineer Tarkowski, Stas' father, who was invited to dinner arrived,\r\nand the whole company, together with a French lady, Nell's teacher,\r\nMadame Olivier, sat at the table.\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlinson, one of the directors of the Suez Canal Company, and\r\nLadislaus Tarkowski, senior engineer of the same company, lived for\r\nmany years upon terms of the closest intimacy. Both were widowers, but\r\nPani Tarkowski, by birth a French lady, died at the time Stas came into\r\nthe world, while Nell's mother died of consumption in Helwan when the\r\ngirl was three years old. Both widowers lived in neighboring houses in\r\nPort Said, and owing to their duties met daily. A common misfortune\r\ndrew them still closer to each other and strengthened the ties of\r\nfriendship previously formed. Mr. Rawlinson loved Stas as his own son,\r\nwhile Pan Tarkowski would have jumped into fire and water for little\r\nNell. After finishing their daily work the most agreeable recreation\r\nfor them was to talk about the children, their education and future.\r\nDuring such conversations it frequently happened that Mr. Rawlinson\r\nwould praise the ability, energy, and bravery of Stas and Pan Tarkowski\r\nwould grow enthusiastic over the sweetness and angelic countenance of\r\nNell. And the one and the other spoke the truth. Stas was a trifle\r\nconceited and a trifle boastful, but diligent in his lessons, and the\r\nteachers in the English school in Port Said, which he attended,\r\ncredited him with uncommon abilities. As to courage and\r\nresourcefulness, he inherited them from his father, for Pan Tarkowski\r\npossessed these qualities in an eminent degree and in a large measure\r\nowed to them his present position.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1863 he fought for eleven months without cessation.\r\nAfterwards, wounded, taken into captivity, and condemned to Siberia, he\r\nescaped from the interior of Russia and made his way to foreign lands.\r\nBefore he entered into the insurrection he was a qualified engineer;\r\nnevertheless he devoted a year to the study of hydraulics. Later he\r\nsecured a position at the Canal and in the course of a few years, when\r\nhis expert knowledge, energy, and industry became known, he assumed the\r\nimportant position of senior engineer.\r\n\r\nStas was born, bred, and reached his fourteenth year in Port Said on\r\nthe Canal; in consequence of which the engineers called him the child\r\nof the desert. At a later period, when he was attending school, he\r\nsometimes, during the vacation season and holidays, accompanied his\r\nfather or Mr. Rawlinson on trips, which their duty required them to\r\nmake from Port Said to Suez to inspect the work on the embankment or\r\nthe dredging of the channel of the Canal. He knew everybody--the\r\nengineers and custom-house officials as well as the laborers, Arabs and\r\nnegroes. He bustled about and insinuated himself everywhere, appearing\r\nwhere least expected; he made long excursions on the embankment, rowed\r\nin a boat over Menzaleh, venturing at times far and wide. He crossed\r\nover to the Arabian bank and mounting the first horse he met, or in the\r\nabsence of a horse, a camel, or even a donkey, he would imitate Farys*\r\n[* Farys, the hero of Adam Mickiewicz's Oriental poem of the same\r\nname.--_Translator's note_.] on the desert; in a word, as Pan Tarkowski\r\nexpressed it, \"he was always popping up somewhere,\" and every moment\r\nfree from his studies he passed on the water.\r\n\r\nHis father did not oppose this, as he knew that rowing, horseback\r\nriding, and continual life in the fresh air strengthened his health and\r\ndeveloped resourcefulness within him. In fact, Stas was taller and\r\nstronger than most boys of his age. It was enough to glance at his eyes\r\nto surmise that in case of any adventure he would sin more from too\r\nmuch audacity than from timidity. In his fourteenth year, he was one of\r\nthe best swimmers in Port Said, which meant  not a little, for the\r\nArabs and negroes swim like fishes. Shooting from carbines of a small\r\ncaliber, and only with cartridges, for wild ducks and Egyptian geese,\r\nhe acquired an unerring eye and steady hand. His dream was to hunt the\r\nbig animals sometime in Central Africa. He therefore eagerly listened\r\nto the narratives of the Sudânese working on the Canal, who in their\r\nnative land had encountered big, thick-skinned, and rapacious beasts.\r\n\r\nThis also had its advantage, for at the same time he learned their\r\nlanguages. It was not enough to excavate the Suez Canal; it was\r\nnecessary also to maintain it, as otherwise the sands of the deserts,\r\nlying on both banks, would fill it up in the course of a year. The\r\ngrand work of De Lesseps demands continual labor and vigilance. So,\r\ntoo, at the present day, powerful machines, under the supervision of\r\nskilled engineers, and thousands of laborers are at work, dredging the\r\nchannel. At the excavation of the Canal, twenty-five thousand men\r\nlabored. To-day, owing to the completion of the work and improved new\r\nmachinery, considerably less are required. Nevertheless, the number is\r\ngreat. Among them the natives of the locality predominate. There is\r\nnot, however, a lack of Nubians, Sudânese, Somalis, and various negroes\r\ncoming from the White and Blue Niles, that is, from the region which\r\nprevious to the Mahdi's insurrection was occupied by the Egyptian\r\nGovernment. Stas lived with all on intimate terms and having, as is\r\nusual with Poles, an extraordinary aptitude for languages he became, he\r\nhimself not knowing how and when, acquainted with many of their\r\ndialects. Born in Egypt, he spoke Arabian like an Arab. From the\r\nnatives of Zanzibar, many of whom worked as firemen on the steam\r\ndredges, he learned Kiswahili, a language widely prevalent all over\r\nCentral Africa. He could even converse with the negroes of the Dinka\r\nand Shilluk tribes, residing on the Nile below Fashoda. Besides this,\r\nhe spoke fluently English, French, and also Polish, for his father, an\r\nardent patriot, was greatly concerned that his son should know the\r\nlanguage of his forefathers. Stas in reality regarded this language as\r\nthe most beautiful in the world and taught it, not without some\r\nsuccess, to little Nell. One thing only he could not accomplish, that\r\nshe should pronounce his name Stas, and not \"Stes.\" Sometimes, on\r\naccount of this, a misunderstanding arose between them, which continued\r\nuntil small tears began to glisten in the eyes of the girl. Then \"Stes\"\r\nwould beg her pardon and became angry at himself.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, an annoying habit of speaking slightingly of her eight\r\nyears and citing by way of contrast his own grave age and experience.\r\nHe contended that a boy who is finishing his fourteenth year, if he is\r\nnot fully matured, at least is not a mere child, but on the contrary,\r\nis capable of performing all kinds of heroic deeds, especially if he\r\nhas Polish and French blood. He craved most ardently that sometime an\r\nopportunity would occur for such deeds, particularly in defense of\r\nNell. Both invented various dangers and Stas was compelled to answer\r\nher questions as to what he would do if, for instance, a crocodile, ten\r\nyards long, or a scorpion as big as a dog, should crawl through the\r\nwindow of her home. To both it never occurred for a moment that\r\nimpending reality would surpass all their fantastic suppositions.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, in the house, good news awaited them during the\r\ndinner. Messrs. Rawlinson and Tarkowski, as skilled engineers, had been\r\ninvited a few weeks before, to examine and appraise the work carried on\r\nin connection with the whole net-work of canals in the Province of\r\nEl-Fayûm, in the vicinity of the city of Medinet near Lake Karûn, as\r\nwell as along the Yûsuf and Nile rivers. They were to stay there for\r\nabout a month and secured furloughs from their company. As the\r\nChristmas holidays were approaching, both gentlemen, not desiring to be\r\nseparated from the children, decided that Stas and Nell should also go\r\nto Medinet. Hearing this news the children almost leaped out of their\r\nskins from joy. They had already visited the cities lying along the\r\nCanal, particularly Ismailia and Suez, and while outside the Canal,\r\nAlexandria and Cairo, near which they viewed the great pyramids and the\r\nSphinx. But these were short trips, while the expedition to Medinet\r\nel-Fayûm required a whole day's travel by railway, southward along the\r\nNile and then westward from El-Wasta towards the Libyan Desert. Stas\r\nknew Medinet from the narratives of younger engineers and tourists who\r\nwent there to hunt for various kinds of water-fowls as well as desert\r\nwolves and hyenas. He knew that it was a separate, great oasis lying\r\noff the west bank of the Nile but not dependent upon its inundations\r\nand having its water system formed by Lake Karûn through Bahr Yûsuf and\r\na whole chain of small canals. Those who had seen this oasis said that\r\nalthough that region belonged to Egypt, nevertheless, being separated\r\nfrom it by a desert, it formed a distinct whole. Only the Yûsuf River\r\nconnects, one might say with a thin blue thread, that locality with the\r\nvalley of the Nile. The great abundance of water, fertility of soil,\r\nand luxuriant vegetation made an earthly paradise of it, while the\r\nextensive ruins of the city of Crocodilopolis drew thither hundreds of\r\ncurious tourists. Stas, however, was attracted mainly by the shores of\r\nLake Karûn, with its swarms of birds and its wolf-hunts on the desert\r\nhills of Gebel el-Sedment.\r\n\r\nBut his vacation began a few days later, and as the inspection of the\r\nwork on the canals was an urgent matter and the gentlemen could not\r\nlose any time, it was arranged that they should leave without delay,\r\nwhile the children, with Madame Olivier, were to depart a week later.\r\nNell and Stas had a desire to leave at once, but Stas did not dare to\r\nmake the request. Instead they began to ask questions about various\r\nmatters relative to the journey, and with new outbursts of joy received\r\nthe news that they would not live in uncomfortable hotels kept by\r\nGreeks, but in tents furnished by the Cook Tourists' Agency. This is\r\nthe customary arrangement of tourists who leave Cairo for a lengthy\r\nstay at Medinet. Cook furnishes tents, servants, cooks, supplies of\r\nprovisions, horses, donkeys, camels, and guides; so the tourist does\r\nnot have to bother about anything. This, indeed, is quite an expensive\r\nmode of traveling; but Messrs. Tarkowski and Rawlinson did not have to\r\ntake that into account as all expenses were borne by the Egyptian\r\nGovernment, which invited them, as experts, to inspect and appraise the\r\nwork on the canals. Nell, who, above everything in the world, loved\r\nriding on a camel, obtained a promise from her father that she should\r\nhave a separate \"hump-backed saddle horse\" on which, together with\r\nMadame Olivier, or Dinah, and sometimes with Stas, she could\r\nparticipate in the excursions to the nearer localities of the desert\r\nand to Karun. Pan Tarkowski promised Stas that he would allow him some\r\nnights to go after wolves, and if he brought a good report from school\r\nhe would get a genuine English short rifle and the necessary equipment\r\nfor a hunter. As Stas was confident that he would succeed, he at once\r\nbegan to regard himself as the owner of a short rifle and promised\r\nhimself to perform various astonishing and immortal feats with it.\r\n\r\nOn such projects and conversation the dinner passed for the overjoyed\r\nchildren. But somewhat less eagerness for the contemplated journey was\r\ndisplayed by Madame Olivier who was loath to leave the comfortable\r\nvilla in Port Said and who was frightened at the thought of living for\r\nseveral weeks in a tent, and particularly at the plan of excursions on\r\ncamel-back. It happened that she had already tried this mode of riding\r\nseveral times and these attempts ended unfortunately. Once the camel\r\nrose too soon, before she was well seated in the saddle, and as a\r\nresult she rolled off his back onto the ground. Another time, the\r\ndromedary, not belonging to the light-footed variety, jolted her so\r\nthat two days elapsed before she recovered; in a word, although Nell,\r\nafter two or three pleasure-rides which Mr. Rawlinson permitted her to\r\ntake, declared that there was nothing more delightful in the world, in\r\nthe same measure only painful recollections remained for Madame\r\nOlivier. She said that this was good enough for Arabs or for a chit\r\nlike Nell, who could not be jolted any more than a fly which should\r\nalight upon a camel's hump, but not for persons dignified, and not too\r\nlight, and having at the same time a certain proneness to unbearable\r\nsea-sickness.\r\n\r\nBut as to Medinet el-Fayûm she had other fears. Now in Port Said as\r\nwell as in Alexandria, Cairo, and in the whole of Egypt nothing was the\r\nsubject of more discussion than the Mahdi's insurrection and the\r\ncruelties of the dervishes. Madame Olivier, not knowing exactly where\r\nMedinet was situated, became alarmed as to whether it was not too near\r\nthe Mahdists, and finally began to question Mr. Rawlinson about it.\r\n\r\nBut he only smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi at this moment is besieging Khartûm in which General Gordon\r\nis defending himself. Does Madame know how far it is from Medinet to\r\nKhartûm?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"About as far as from here to Sicily,\" explained Pan Tarkowski.\r\n\r\n\"Just about,\" corroborated Stas. \"Khartûm lies where the White and Blue\r\nNiles meet and form one river. We are separated from it by the immense\r\nexpanse of Egypt and the whole of Nubia.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards he wanted to add that even if Medinet should be closer to\r\nthe regions overrun by the insurgents, he, of course, would be there\r\nwith his short rifle; but recalling that for similar bragging he\r\nsometimes received a sharp reproof from his father, he became silent.\r\n\r\nThe older members of the party, however, began to talk of the Mahdi and\r\nthe insurrection, for this was the most important matter affecting\r\nEgypt. The news from Khartûm was bad. The wild hordes already had been\r\nbesieging the city for a month and a half and the Egyptian and English\r\ngovernments were acting slowly. The relief expedition had barely\r\nstarted and it was generally feared that notwithstanding the fame,\r\nbravery, and ability of Gordon this important city would fall into the\r\nhands of the barbarians. This was the opinion of Pan Tarkowski, who\r\nsuspected that England in her soul desired that the Mahdi should wrest\r\nit from Egypt in order to retake it later from him and make this vast\r\nregion an English possession. He did not, however, share this suspicion\r\nwith Mr. Rawlinson as he did not want to offend his patriotic feelings.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the dinner Stas began to ask why the Egyptian\r\nGovernment had annexed all the country lying south of Nubia,\r\nparticularly Kordofân, Darfur, and the Sudân as far as Lake Albert\r\nNyanza and deprived the natives there of their liberty. Mr. Rawlinson\r\nexplained that whatever was done by the Egyptian Government was done at\r\nthe request of England which extended a protectorate over Egypt and in\r\nreality ruled her as Egypt herself desired.\r\n\r\n\"The Egyptian Government did not deprive anybody of his liberty,\" he\r\nsaid, \"but restored it to hundreds of thousands and perhaps to millions\r\nof people. In Kordofân, in Darfur and in the Sudân there were not\r\nduring the past years any independent States. Only here and there some\r\npetty ruler laid claim to some lands and took possession of them by\r\nforce in spite of the will of the residents. They were mainly inhabited\r\nby independent Arab-negro tribes, that is, by people having the blood\r\nof both races. These tribes lived in a state of incessant warfare. They\r\nattacked each other and seized horses, camels, cattle, and, above all,\r\nslaves; besides, they perpetrated numerous atrocities. But the worst\r\nwere the ivory and slave hunters. They formed a separate class, to\r\nwhich belonged nearly all the chiefs of the tribes and the richer\r\ntraders. They made armed expeditions into the interior of Africa,\r\nappropriating everywhere ivory tusks, and carried away thousands of\r\npeople: men, women, and children. In addition they destroyed villages\r\nand settlements, devastated fields, shed streams of blood, and\r\nslaughtered without pity all who resisted. In the southern portion of\r\nthe Sudân, Darfur, and Kordofân, as well as the region beyond the Upper\r\nNile as far as the lake they depopulated some localities entirely. But\r\nthe Arabian bands made their incursions farther and farther so that\r\nCentral Africa became a land of tears and blood. Now England which, as\r\nyou know, pursues slave-dealers all over the world, consented that the\r\nEgyptian Government should annex Kordofân, Darfur, and the Sudân. This\r\nwas the only method to compel these pillagers to abandon their\r\nabominable trade and the only way to hold them in restraint. The\r\nunfortunate negroes breathed more freely; the depredations ceased and\r\nthe people began to live under tolerable laws. But such a state of\r\naffairs did not please the traders, so when Mohammed Ahmed, known\r\nto-day as 'the Mahdi,' appeared among them and proclaimed a holy war on\r\nthe pretext that the true faith of Mahomet was perishing, all rushed\r\nlike one man to arms; and so that terrible war has been kindled in\r\nwhich thus far the Egyptians have met with such poor success. The Mahdi\r\nhas defeated the forces of the Government in every battle. He has\r\noccupied Kordofân, Darfur, and the Sudân; his hordes at present are\r\nlaying a siege to Khartûm and are advancing to the north as far as the\r\nfrontiers of Nubia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can they advance as far as Egypt?\" asked Stas.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Mr. Rawlinson. \"The Mahdi announces, indeed, that he\r\nwill conquer the whole world, but he is a wild man who has no\r\nconception of anything. He never will take Egypt, as England would not\r\npermit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If, however, the Egyptian troops are completely routed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then would appear the English armies which no one has ever overcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why did England permit the Mahdi to occupy so much territory?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that she has permitted it?\" replied Mr. Rawlinson.\r\n\"England is never in a hurry because she is eternal.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by a negro servant, who announced\r\nthat Fatma Smain had arrived and begged for an audience.\r\n\r\nWomen in the East are occupied exclusively with household affairs and\r\nseldom leave the harems. Only the poorer ones go to the market or work\r\nin the fields, as the wives of the fellahs, the Egyptian peasants, do;\r\nbut these at such times veil their faces. Though in the Sudân, from\r\nwhich region Fatma came, this custom was not observed, and though she\r\nhad come to Mr. Rawlinson's office previously, nevertheless, her\r\narrival, particularly at such a late hour and at a private house,\r\nevoked surprise.\r\n\r\n\"We shall learn something new about Smain,\" said Pan Tarkowski.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Mr. Rawlinson, giving at the same time a signal to the\r\nservant to usher Fatma in.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after a while there entered a tall, young Sudânese woman\r\nwith countenance entirely unveiled, complexion very dark, and eyes\r\nbeautiful but wild, and a trifle ominous. Entering, she at once\r\nprostrated herself, and when Mr. Rawlinson ordered her to rise, she\r\nraised herself but remained on her knees.\r\n\r\n\"Sidi,\" she said, \"May Allah bless thee, thy posterity, thy home, and\r\nthy flocks!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" asked the engineer.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, help, and succor in misfortune, oh, sir! I am imprisoned in\r\nPort Said and destruction hangs over me and my children.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that you are imprisoned, and yet you could come here, and in\r\nthe night-time at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been escorted by the police who day and night watch my house,\r\nand I know that they have an order to cut off our heads soon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak like a rational woman,\" answered Mr. Rawlinson, shrugging his\r\nshoulders. \"You are not in the Sudân, but in Egypt where no one is\r\nexecuted without a trial. So you may be certain that not a hair will\r\nfall from your head or the heads of your children.\"\r\n\r\nBut she began to implore him to intercede for her yet once more with\r\nthe Government, to procure permission for her to go to Smain.\r\n\r\n\"Englishmen as great as you are, sir,\" she said, \"can do everything.\r\nThe Government in Cairo thinks that Smain is a traitor, but that is\r\nfalse. There visited me yesterday Arabian merchants, who arrived from\r\nSuâkin, and before that they bought gums and ivory in the Sudân, and\r\nthey informed me that Smain is lying sick at El-Fasher and is calling\r\nfor me and the children to bless them--\"\r\n\r\n\"All this is your fabrication, Fatma,\" interrupted Mr. Rawlinson.\r\n\r\nBut she began to swear by Allah that she spoke the truth, and\r\nafterwards said that if Smain got well, he undoubtedly would ransom all\r\nthe Christian captives; and if he should die, she, as a relative of the\r\nleader of the dervishes, could obtain access to him easily and would\r\nsecure whatever she wished. Let them only allow her to leave, for her\r\nheart will leap out of her bosom from longing for her husband. In what\r\nhad she, ill-fated woman, offended the Government or the Khedive? Was\r\nit her fault or could she be held accountable because she was the\r\nrelative of the dervish, Mohammed Ahmed?\r\n\r\nFatma did not dare in the presence of the \"English people\" to call her\r\nrelative \"the Mahdi,\" as that meant the Redeemer of the world. She knew\r\nthat the Egyptian Government regarded him as a rebel and an imposter.\r\nBut continually striking her forehead and invoking heaven to witness\r\nher innocence and unhappy plight, she began to weep and at the same\r\ntime wail mournfully as women in the East do after losing husbands or\r\nsons. Afterwards she again flung herself with face on the ground, or\r\nrather on the carpet with which the inlaid floor was covered, and\r\nwaited in silence.\r\n\r\nNell, who towards the close of the dinner felt a little sleepy, became\r\nthoroughly aroused and, having an upright little heart, seized her\r\nfather's hand, and kissing it again and again, began to beg for Fatma.\r\n\r\n\"Let papa help her! Do please, papa!\"\r\n\r\nFatma, evidently understanding English, exclaimed amidst her sobs, not\r\nremoving her face from the carpet:\r\n\r\n\"May Allah bless thee, bird of paradise, with the joys of Omayya, oh,\r\nstar without a blemish!\"\r\n\r\nHowever implacable Stas in his soul was towards the Mahdists, he was\r\nmoved by Fatma's entreaties and grief. Besides, Nell interceded for her\r\nand he in the end always wanted that which Nell wished. So after a\r\nwhile he spoke out, as if to himself but so that all could hear him:\r\n\r\n\"If I were the Government, I would allow Fatma to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"But as you are not the Government,\" Pan Tarkowski said to him, \"you\r\nwould do better not to interfere in that which does not concern you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlinson also had a compassionate soul and was sensible of Fatma's\r\nsituation, but certain statements which she made struck him as being\r\ndownright falsehoods. Having almost daily relations with the\r\ncustom-house at Ismailia, he well knew that no new cargoes of gums or\r\nivory were being transported lately through the Canal. The trade in\r\nthose wares had ceased almost entirely. Arabian traders, moreover,\r\ncould not return from the city of El-Fasher which lay in the Sudân, as\r\nthe Mahdists, as a rule, barred all traders from their territories, and\r\nthose whom they captured were despoiled and kept in captivity. And it\r\nwas almost a certainty that the statement about Smain's sickness was a\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\nBut as Nell's little eyes were still looking at her papa appealingly,\r\nhe, not desiring to sadden the little girl, after a while said to Fatma:\r\n\r\n\"Fatma, I already have written at your request to the Government, but\r\nwithout result. And now listen. To-morrow, with this mehendis\r\n(engineer) whom you see here, I leave for Medinet el-Fayûm; on the way\r\nwe shall stop one day in Cairo, for the Khedive desires to confer with\r\nus about the canals leading from Bahr Yûsuf and give us a commission as\r\nto the same. During the conference I shall take care to present your\r\ncase and try to secure for you his favor. But I can do nothing more,\r\nnor shall I promise more.\"\r\n\r\nFatma rose and, extending both hands in sign of gratitude, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"And so I am safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Fatma,\" answered Mr. Rawlinson, \"do not speak of safety for I\r\nalready told you that death threatens neither you nor your children.\r\nBut that the Khedive will consent to your departure I do not guarantee,\r\nfor Smain is not sick but is a traitor, who, having taken money from\r\nthe Government, does not at all think of ransoming the captives from\r\nMohammed Ahmed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smain is innocent, sir, and lies in El-Fasher,\" reiterated Fatma, \"but\r\nif even he broke his faith with the Government, I swear before you, my\r\nbenefactor, that if I am allowed to depart I will entreat Mohammed\r\nAhmed until I secure the deliverance of your captives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. I promise you once more that I will intercede for you with\r\nthe Khedive.\"\r\n\r\nFatma began to prostrate herself.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Sidi! You are not only powerful, but just. And now I\r\nentreat that you permit me to serve you as a slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Egypt no one can be a slave,\" answered Mr. Rawlinson with a smile.\r\n\"I have enough servants and cannot avail myself of your services; for,\r\nas I told you, we all are leaving for Medinet and perhaps will remain\r\nthere until Ramazan.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, sir, for the overseer, Chadigi, told me about that. I, when I\r\nheard of it, came not only to implore you for help, but also to tell\r\nyou that two men of my Dongola tribe, Idris and Gebhr, are camel\r\ndrivers in Medinet and will prostrate themselves before you when you\r\narrive, submitting to your commands themselves and their camels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, good,\" answered the director, \"but that is the affair of the\r\nCook Agency, not mine.\"\r\n\r\nFatma, having kissed the hands of the two engineers and the children,\r\ndeparted blessing Nell particularly. Both gentlemen remained silent for\r\na while, after which Mr. Rawlinson said:\r\n\r\n\"Poor woman! But she lies as only in the East they know how to lie, and\r\neven in her declaration of gratitude there is a sound of some false\r\nnote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" answered Pan Tarkowski; \"but to tell the truth, whether\r\nSmain betrayed or did not, the Government has no right to detain her in\r\nEgypt, as she cannot be held responsible for her husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Government does not now allow any Sudânese to leave for Suâkin or\r\nNubia without a special permit; so the prohibition does not affect\r\nFatma alone. Many of them are found in Egypt for they come here for\r\ngain. Among them are some who belong to the Dongolese tribe; that is\r\nthe one from which the Mahdi comes. There are, for instance, besides\r\nFatma, Chadigi and those two camel drivers in Medinet. The Mahdists\r\ncall the Egyptians Turks and are carrying on a war with them, but among\r\nthe local Arabs can be found a considerable number of adherents of the\r\nMahdi, who would willingly join him. We must number among them all the\r\nfanatics, all the partisans of Arabi Pasha, and many among the poorer\r\nclasses. They hold it ill of the Government that it yielded entirely to\r\nEnglish influence and claim that the religion suffers by it. God knows\r\nhow many already have escaped across the desert, avoiding the customary\r\nsea route to Suâkin. So the Government, having learned that Fatma also\r\nwanted to run away, ordered her to be put under surveillance. For her\r\nand her children only, as relatives of the Mahdi himself, can an\r\nexchange of the captives be effected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the lower classes in Egypt really favor the Mahdi?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi has followers even in the army, which perhaps for that\r\nreason fights so poorly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can the Sudânese fly across the desert? Why, that is a\r\nthousand miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, by that route slaves were brought into Egypt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should judge that Fatma's children could not endure such a journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is why she wants to shorten it and ride by way of the sea to\r\nSuâkin.\"\r\n\r\n\"In any case, she is a poor woman.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the conversation concluded.\r\n\r\nTwelve hours later \"the poor woman,\" having carefully closeted herself\r\nin her house with the son of the overseer Chadigi, whispered to him\r\nwith knitted brows and a grim glance of her beautiful eyes:\r\n\r\n\"Chamis, son of Chadigi, here is the money. Go even to-day to Medinet\r\nand give to Idris this writing, which the devout dervish Bellali, at my\r\nrequest, wrote to him. The children of the mehendes are good, but if I\r\ndo not obtain a permit, then there is no other alternative. I know you\r\nwill not betray me. Remember that you and your father too come from the\r\nDongolese tribe in which was born the great Mahdi.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth engineers left the following night for Cairo where they were to\r\nvisit the British minister plenipotentiary and hold an audience with\r\nthe viceroy. Stas calculated that this would require two days, and his\r\ncalculation appeared accurate, for on the third day at night he\r\nreceived from his father, who was already at Medinet, the following\r\nmessage: \"The tents are ready. You are to leave the moment your\r\nvacation begins. Inform Fatma through Chadigi that we could not\r\naccomplish anything for her.\" A similar message was also received by\r\nMadame Olivier who at once, with the assistance of the negress Dinah,\r\nbegan to make preparations for the journey.\r\n\r\nThe sight of these preparations gladdened the hearts of the children.\r\nBut suddenly an accident occurred which deranged their plans and seemed\r\nlikely to prevent their journey. On the day on which Stas' winter\r\nvacation began and on the eve of their departure a scorpion stung\r\nMadame Olivier during her afternoon nap in the garden. These venomous\r\ncreatures in Egypt are not usually very dangerous, but in this case the\r\nsting might become exceptionally baleful. The scorpion had crawled onto\r\nthe head-rest of the linen chair and stung Madame Olivier in the neck\r\nat a moment when she leaned her head against the rest. As she had\r\nsuffered lately from erysipelas in the face, fear was entertained that\r\nthe sickness might recur. A physician was summoned at once, but he\r\narrived two hours later as he had engagements elsewhere. The neck and\r\neven the face were already swollen, after which fever appeared, with\r\nthe usual symptoms of poisoning. The physician announced that under the\r\ncircumstances there could not be any talk of a journey and ordered the\r\npatient to bed. In view of this it seemed highly probable that the\r\nchildren would be compelled to pass the Christmas holidays at home. In\r\njustice to Nell it must be stated that in the first moments\r\nparticularly she thought more of the sufferings of her teacher than of\r\nthe lost pleasures in Medinet. She only wept in corners at the thought\r\nof not seeing her father for a few weeks. Stas did not accept the\r\naccident with the same resignation. He first forwarded a dispatch and\r\nafterwards mailed a letter with an inquiry as to what they were to do.\r\nThe reply came in two days. Mr. Rawlinson first communicated with the\r\nphysician; having learned from him that immediate danger was removed\r\nand that only a fear of the recurrence of erysipelas prevented Madame\r\nOlivier's departure from Port Said, he, above all, took precaution that\r\nshe should have proper care and nursing, and afterwards sent the\r\nchildren permission to travel with Dinah. But as Dinah, notwithstanding\r\nher extreme attachment for Nell, was not able to take care of herself\r\non the railways and in the hotels, the duties of guide and paymaster\r\nduring this trip devolved upon Stas. It can easily be understood how\r\nproud he was of this role and with what chivalrous spirit he assured\r\nlittle Nell that not a hair would fall from her head, as if in reality\r\nthe road to Cairo and to Medinet presented any difficulties or dangers.\r\n\r\nAll preparations having been completed, the children started that very\r\nday for Ismailia by way of the Canal. From Ismailia they were to travel\r\nby rail to Cairo, where they were to pass the night. On the following\r\nday they were to ride to Medinet. Leaving Ismailia they saw Lake Timsâh\r\nwhich Stas already knew, as Pan Tarkowski, being an ardent sportsman,\r\nin moments free from his duties had taken Stas along with him to hunt\r\nfor aquatic birds. Afterwards the road ran along Wâdi Tûmilât close to\r\nthe fresh-water canal leading from the Nile to Ismailia and Suez. This\r\ncanal had been dug before the Suez Canal, so that the workingmen\r\nworking on De Lesseps' grand achievement would not be deprived entirely\r\nof water fit for drinking purposes. But its excavation had yet another\r\nfortunate result, for this region, which before was a sterile desert,\r\nbloomed anew when through it coursed a strong and life-bringing stream\r\nof fresh water. The children could observe on the left side from the\r\nwindows of the coach a wide belt of verdure composed of meadows on\r\nwhich were pastured horses, camels, and sheep, and of tilled fields,\r\ndiversified with maize, millet, alfalfa, and other varieties of plants\r\nused for fodder. On the bank of the canal could be seen all kinds of\r\nwells in the shape of large wheels with buckets attached, or in the\r\nusual form of well-sweeps, drawing water, which fellahs laboriously\r\ncarried to the garden-beds or conveyed in barrels, on wagons drawn by\r\nbuffaloes. Over the sprouting grain pigeons soared, and at times a\r\nwhole covey of quails sprang up. On the canal banks, storks and cranes\r\ngravely stalked. In the distance, above the mud hovels of the fellahs\r\ntowered, like plumes of feathers, the crowns of date palms.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, on the north side of the railway there stretched a\r\nstark desert, but unlike the one which lay on the other side of the\r\nSuez Canal. That one looked as level as would the bottom of the sea,\r\nfrom which the water had disappeared and only wrinkled sand remained,\r\nwhile here the sand was more yellowish, heaped up as if in great\r\nknolls, covered on the sides with tufts of gray vegetation. Between\r\nthose knolls, which here and there changed into high hills, lay wide\r\nvalleys in which from time to time caravans could be seen moving.\r\n\r\nFrom the windows of the car the children could catch sight of heavily\r\nloaded camels, walking in a long string, one after another, over the\r\nsandy expanse. In front of each camel was an Arab in a black mantle,\r\nwith a white turban on his head. Little Nell was reminded of the\r\npictures in the Bible, which she had seen at home, representing the\r\nIsraelites entering Egypt during the times of Joseph. They were exactly\r\nthe same. Unfortunately she could not see the caravans very well as at\r\nthe windows on that side of the car sat two English officers, who\r\nobstructed her view.\r\n\r\nBut she had scarcely told this to Stas, when he turned to the officers\r\nwith a very grave mien and, touching his hat with his finger, said:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, could you kindly make room for this little Miss who wishes\r\nto look at the camels?\"\r\n\r\nBoth officers accepted the suggestion with the same gravity, and one of\r\nthem not only surrendered his place to the curious Miss but lifted her\r\nand placed her in a seat near the window.\r\n\r\nAnd Stas began his lecture:\r\n\r\n\"This is the ancient land of Goshen, which Pharaoh gave to Joseph for\r\nhis brother Israelites. At one time in far antiquity a canal of fresh\r\nwater ran here so that this new one is but a reconstruction of the old.\r\nBut later it fell into ruin and the country became a desert. Now the\r\nsoil again is fertile.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does the gentleman know this?\" asked one of the officers.\r\n\r\n\"At my age, we know such things,\" answered Stas; \"and besides, not long\r\nago Professor Sterling gave us a lecture on Wâdi Tûmilât.\"\r\n\r\nThough Stas spoke English quite fluently, his slightly different accent\r\nattracted the attention of the other officer, who asked:\r\n\r\n\"Is the little gentleman an Englishman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Nell, whose father entrusted her to my care on this journey, is\r\nlittle. I am not an Englishman but a Pole and the son of an engineer at\r\nthe Canal.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer, hearing the answer of the pert boy, smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"I esteem the Poles. I belong to a regiment of cavalry, which during\r\nthe times of Napoleon several times fought with the Polish Uhlans, and\r\nthat tradition until the present day forms its glory and honor.\"* [*\r\nThose regiments of English cavalry which during the times of Napoleon\r\nmet the Polish cavalry actually pride themselves with that fact at the\r\npresent time, and every officer speaking of his regiment never fails to\r\nsay, \"We fought with the Poles.\" See Chevrillon, \"Aux Indes.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I am pleased to form your acquaintance,\" answered Stas.\r\n\r\nThe conversation easily proceeded farther, for the officers were\r\nevidently amused. It appeared that both were also riding from Port Said\r\nto Cairo to see the British minister plenipotentiary and to receive\r\nfinal instructions for a long journey which soon awaited them. The\r\nyounger one was an army surgeon, while the one who spoke to Stas,\r\nCaptain Glenn, had an order from his government to proceed from Cairo,\r\nvia Suez, to Mombasa and assume the government of the entire region\r\nadjoining that port and extending as far as the unknown Samburu country.\r\n\r\nStas, who with deep interest read about travels in Africa, knew that\r\nMombasa was situated a few degrees beyond the equator and that the\r\nadjoining country, though already conceded to be within the sphere of\r\nEnglish interests, was yet in truth little known; it was utterly wild,\r\nfull of elephants, giraffes, rhinoceroses, buffaloes, and all kinds of\r\nantelopes, which the military, missionary, and trading expeditions\r\nalways encountered. He also envied Captain Glenn with his whole soul\r\nand promised to visit him in Mombasa and go hunting with him for lions\r\nand buffaloes.\r\n\r\n\"Good, but I shall invite you to make the visit with that little Miss,\"\r\nreplied Captain Glenn, laughing and pointing at Nell who at that moment\r\nleft the window and sat beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Rawlinson has a father,\" answered Stas, \"and I am only her\r\nguardian during this journey.\"\r\n   At this the other officer turned quickly around and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Rawlinson? Is he not one of the directors of the Canal and has he not\r\na brother in Bombay?\"\r\n\r\n\"My uncle lives in Bombay,\" answered Nell, raising her little finger\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\n\"Then your uncle, darling, is married to my sister. My name is Clary.\r\nWe are related, and I am really delighted that I met and became\r\nacquainted with you, my little dear.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the surgeon was really delighted. He said that immediately after\r\nhis arrival at Port Said he inquired for Mr. Rawlinson, but in the\r\noffices of the directory he was informed that he had left for the\r\nholidays. He expressed also his regret that the steamer which he with\r\nCaptain Glenn was to take for Mombasa left Suez in a few days, in\r\nconsequence of which he could not make a hurried visit to Medinet.\r\n\r\nHe therefore requested Nell to convey his compliments to her father,\r\nand promised to write to her from Mombasa. Both officers now engaged\r\nmainly in a conversation with Nell, so that Stas remained a little on\r\nthe side. At all stations they had a plentiful supply of mandarin\r\noranges, dates, and exquisite sherbet, and, besides by Stas and Nell,\r\nthese dainties were shared by Dinah, who with all her good qualities\r\nwas known for her uncommon gluttony.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the trip to Cairo passed quickly for the children. At\r\nthe leave-taking the officers kissed Nell's little hands and face, and\r\nsqueezed Stas' right hand, and at the same time, Captain Glenn, whom\r\nthe resolute boy pleased very much, said half-jokingly and\r\nhalf-seriously:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, my boy! Who knows where, when, and under what circumstances we\r\nmay yet meet in life. Remember, however, that you can always rely upon\r\nmy good will and assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you may likewise rely upon me,\" Stas answered with a bow full of\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nPan Tarkowski, as well as Mr. Rawlinson, who loved Nell better than his\r\nlife, was delighted at the arrival of the children. The young pair\r\ngreeted their parents joyfully, and at once began to look about the\r\ntents, which internally were completely fitted up and were ready for\r\nthe reception of the beloved guests. The tents appeared superb to them;\r\nthey were double, one was lined with blue and the other with red\r\nflannel, overlaid at the bottom with saddle-cloths, and they were as\r\nspacious as large rooms. The agency which was concerned about the\r\nopinion of the high officials of the Canal Company had spared no effort\r\nfor their comfort. At first Mr. Rawlinson feared that a lengthy stay\r\nunder tents might prove injurious to Nell's health, and if he agreed to\r\nthe arrangement, it was because they could always move to a hotel in\r\ncase of bad weather. Now, however, having fully investigated everything\r\non the place, he came to the conclusion that days and nights passed in\r\nthe fresh air would be a hundredfold more beneficial for his only child\r\nthan a stay in the musty rooms of the small local hotels. Beautiful\r\nweather favored this. Medinet, or rather El-Medineh, surrounded by the\r\nsandy hills of the Libyan Desert, has a much better climate than Cairo\r\nand is not in vain called \"the land of roses.\" Owing to its sheltered\r\nposition and the plentiful moisture in the air, nights there are not so\r\ncold as in other parts of Egypt, even those lying further south. Winter\r\nis simply delightful, and from November the greatest development of the\r\nvegetation begins. Date palms, olive-trees, which on the whole are\r\nscarce in Egypt, fig, orange, mandarin trees, giant castor-oil plants,\r\npomegranate and various other southern plants cover this delightful\r\noasis as with a forest. The gardens are overflowing, as it were, with a\r\ngigantic wave of acacias, elders, and roses, so that at night every\r\nbreeze carries their intoxicating scent. Here one breathes with full\r\nbreast and \"does not wish to die,\" as the residents of the place say.\r\n\r\nA similar climate is possessed only by Helwan lying on the other side\r\nof the Nile and considerably farther north, but Helwan lacks such\r\nluxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\nBut Helwan awoke sad recollections for Mr. Rawlinson, for there Nell's\r\nmother had died. For this reason he preferred Medinet, and gazing at\r\npresent at the glowing countenance of the little girl, he promised to\r\nhimself in his soul soon to purchase here land with a garden; to erect\r\nupon it a comfortable English house and spend in these blissful parts\r\nall vacations which he could secure, and after finishing his service on\r\nthe Canal, perhaps even to reside here permanently.\r\n\r\nBut these were plans of the distant future and not yet wholly matured.\r\nIn the meantime the children from the moment of their arrival moved\r\nabout everywhere like flies, desiring even before dinner to see all the\r\ntents as well as the donkeys and camels hired at the place by the Cook\r\nAgency. It appeared that the animals were on a distant pasture and that\r\nthey could not see them until the morrow. However, near Mr. Rawlinson's\r\ntent they observed with pleasure Chamis, the son of Chadigi, their good\r\nacquaintance in Port Said. He was not in the employ of Cook, and Mr.\r\nRawlinson was somewhat surprised to meet him in Medinet, but as he had\r\npreviously employed him to carry his implements, he engaged him at\r\npresent to run errands and perform all other small services.\r\n\r\nThe evening dinner was excellent, as the old Copt, who for many years\r\nwas a cook in the employment of the Cook Agency, was anxious to display\r\nhis culinary skill. The children told about the acquaintance they made\r\nwith the two officers on the way, which was particularly interesting to\r\nMr. Rawlinson, whose brother Richard was married to Dr. Clary's sister\r\nand had resided in India for many years. As it was a childless\r\nmarriage, this uncle greatly loved his little niece, whom he knew only\r\nfrom photographs, and he had inquired about her in all his letters.\r\nBoth fathers were also amused at the invitation which Stas had received\r\nfrom Captain Glenn to visit Mombasa. The boy took it seriously and\r\npositively promised himself that sometime he must pay a visit to his\r\nnew friend beyond the equator. Pan Tarkowski then had to explain to him\r\nthat English officials never remain long in the same locality on\r\naccount of the deadly climate of Africa, and that before Stas grew up\r\nthe captain already would hold his tenth position in rotation or would\r\nnot be on earth at all.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the whole company went out in front of the tents, where\r\nthe servants placed the cloth folding-chairs, and for the older\r\ngentlemen brought a siphon of soda-water with brandy. It was already\r\nnight but unusually warm; as there happened to be full moon it was as\r\nbright as in daytime. The white walls of the city buildings opposite\r\nthe tents shone greenly; the stars glowed in the sky, and in the air\r\nwas diffused the scent of roses, acacias, and heliotropes. The city\r\nalready was asleep. In the silence of the night at times could be heard\r\nonly the loud cries of cranes, herons, and flamingoes flying from\r\nbeyond the Nile in the direction of Lake Karûn. Suddenly, however,\r\nthere resounded the deep bass bark of a dog which astonished Stas and\r\nNell, for it appeared to come from a tent which they had not visited\r\nand which was assigned for saddles, implements, and various traveling\r\nparaphernalia.\r\n\r\n\"That must be an awfully big dog. Let us go and see him,\" said Stas.\r\n\r\nPan Tarkowski began to laugh and Mr. Rawlinson shook off the ashes of\r\nhis cigar and said, also laughing:\r\n\r\n\"Well, it did not do any good to lock him up.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which he addressed the children:\r\n\r\n\"Remember, to-morrow is Christmas Eve, and that dog was intended by Pan\r\nTarkowski to be a surprise for Nell, but as the surprise has started to\r\nbark, I am compelled to announce it to-day.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, Nell climbed in a trice on Pan Tarkowski's knees and\r\nembraced his neck and afterwards jumped onto her father's lap.\r\n\r\n\"Papa, how happy I am! how happy I am!\"\r\n\r\nOf hugs and kisses there was no end. Finally Nell, finding herself on\r\nher own feet, began to gaze in Pan Tarkowski's eyes:\r\n\r\n\"Pan Tarkowski--\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Nell?\"\r\n\r\n\"--As I already know that he is there, can I see him to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew,\" exclaimed Mr. Rawlinson, feigning indignation, \"that this\r\nlittle fly would not be content with the news itself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Pan Tarkowski, turning to the son of Chadigi, said:\r\n\r\n\"Chamis, bring the dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Sudânese disappeared behind the kitchen tent and after a\r\nwhile reappeared, leading a big dog by the collar.\r\n\r\nNell retreated.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she exclaimed, seizing her father's hand.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Stas grew enthusiastic.\r\n\r\n\"But that is a lion, not a dog,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"He is called Saba (lion),\" answered Pan Tarkowski. \"He belongs to the\r\nbreed of mastiffs; these are the biggest dogs in the world. This one is\r\nonly two years old but really is exceedingly large. Don't be afraid,\r\nNell, as he is as gentle as a lamb. Only be brave. Let him go, Chamis.\"\r\n\r\nChamis let go of the collar with which he had restrained the dog, and\r\nthe latter, feeling that he was free, began to wag his tail, fawn\r\nbefore Pan Tarkowski with whom he was already well acquainted, and bark\r\njoyfully.\r\n\r\nThe children gazed in the moonlight with admiration on his large round\r\nhead with hanging lips, on his bulky paws, on his powerful frame,\r\nreminding one, in truth, of a lion with the tawny-yellowish color of\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\n\"With such a dog one could safely go through Africa,\" exclaimed Stas.\r\n\r\n\"Ask him whether he could retrieve a rhinoceros,\" said Pan Tarkowski.\r\n\r\nSaba could not, indeed, answer that question, but instead wagged his\r\ntail more and more joyfully and drew near to the group so\r\ningratiatingly that Nell at once ceased to fear him and began to pat\r\nhim on his head.\r\n\r\n\"Saba, nice, dear Saba.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlinson leaned over him, raised his head towards the face of the\r\nlittle girl, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Saba, look at this little lady. She is your mistress. You must obey\r\nand guard her. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wow!\" was the basso response of Saba, as if he actually understood\r\nwhat was wanted.\r\n\r\nAnd he understood even better than might have been expected, for taking\r\nadvantage of the fact that his head was on a level with the little\r\ngirl's face, as a mark of homage he licked her little nose and cheeks\r\nwith his broad tongue.\r\n\r\nThis provoked a general outburst of laughter. Nell had to go to the\r\ntent to wash herself. Returning after a quarter of an hour she saw Saba\r\nwith paws upon the shoulders of Stas, who bent under the weight; the\r\ndog was higher by a head.\r\n\r\nThe time for sleep was approaching, but the little one asked for yet\r\nhalf an hour of play in order to get better acquainted with her new\r\nfriend. In fact, the acquaintance proceeded so easily that Pan\r\nTarkowski soon placed her in lady fashion on Saba's back and, holding\r\nher from fear that she might fall, ordered Stas to lead the dog by the\r\ncollar. She rode thus a score of paces, after which Stas tried to mount\r\nthis peculiar \"saddle-horse,\" but the dog sat on his hind legs so that\r\nStas unexpectedly found himself on the sand near the tail.\r\n\r\nThe children were about to retire when in the distance on the market\r\nplace, illumined by the moon, appeared two white figures walking\r\ntowards the tents.\r\n\r\nThe hitherto gentle Saba began to growl hollowly and threateningly so\r\nthat Chamis, at Mr. Rawlinson's order, again had to take hold of the\r\ncollar, and in the meantime two men dressed in white burnooses stood\r\nbefore the tent.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" asked Pan Tarkowski.\r\n\r\n\"Camel drivers,\" answered one of the arrivals.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Idris and Gebhr? What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"We come to ask whether you will need us to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. To-morrow and the day after are great holidays, during which it is\r\nnot proper to make excursions. Come on the morning of the third day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, effendi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you good camels?\" asked Mr. Rawlinson.\r\n\r\n\"Bismillah!\" answered Idris; \"real saddle-horses with fat humps and as\r\ngentle as ha'-ga (lambs). Otherwise Cook would not have employed us.\"\r\n   \"Do they jolt much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, you can place a handful of kidney-beans on their backs and\r\nnot a grain will fall during the fullest speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"If one is to exaggerate, then exaggerate after the Arabian fashion,\"\r\nsaid Pan Tarkowski, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Or after the Sudânese,\" added Mr. Rawlinson.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Idris and Gebhr continued to stand like two white\r\ncolumns, gazing attentively at Stas and Nell. The moon illumined their\r\nvery dark faces, and in its luster they looked as if cast of bronze.\r\nThe whites of their eyes glittered greenishly from under the turbans.\r\n\r\n\"Good night to you,\" said Mr. Rawlinson.\r\n\r\n\"May Allah watch over you, effendi, in night and in day.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, they bowed and went away. They were accompanied by a\r\nhollow growl, similar to distant thunder, from Saba, whom the two\r\nSudânese apparently did not please.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the following days there were no excursions. Instead, on\r\nChristmas Eve, when the first star appeared in heaven, a little tree in\r\nMr. Rawlinson's tent, intended for Nell, was illuminated with hundreds\r\nof candles. To serve as a Christmas tree there had been taken an arbor\r\nvitae, cut in one of the gardens in Medinet; nevertheless, among its\r\nbranchlets Nell found a profusion of dainties and a splendid doll,\r\nwhich her father had brought from Cairo for her, and Stas, his much\r\ndesired English short rifle. In addition he received from his father\r\npackages containing various hunters' supplies, and a saddle for\r\nhorseback riding. Nell could not contain herself for joy, while Stas,\r\nalthough he thought that whoever owned a genuine short rifle ought to\r\npossess a corresponding dignity, could not restrain himself, and\r\nselecting the time when no one was about, walked around the tent on his\r\nhands. This knack, taught to him at the Port Said school, he possessed\r\nto a surprising degree and with it often amused Nell, who, besides,\r\nsincerely envied it in him.\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve and the first day of the holidays were passed by the\r\nchildren partly in church services, partly in inspecting the gifts they\r\nhad received, and in training Saba. The new friend appeared to possess\r\nintelligence beyond all expectations. On the very first day he learned\r\nto give his paw, retrieve handkerchiefs, which, however, he would not\r\nsurrender without some resistance, and he understood that cleaning\r\nNell's face with his tongue was an act unworthy of a gentlemanly dog.\r\nNell, holding her fingers at her little nose, gave him various\r\ninstructions, while he, concurring with motions of his tail, gave her\r\nin this manner to understand that he heard with becoming attention and\r\ntook her lessons to heart. During their strolls over the sandy city\r\nsquare the fame of Saba in Medinet grew with each hour and, even as all\r\nfame, began to have its disagreeable side, for it drew a whole swarm of\r\nArabian children. In the beginning they kept at a distance; afterwards,\r\nhowever, emboldened by the gentleness of the \"monster,\" they approached\r\nmore and more closely, and in the end sat around the tent so that no\r\none could move about with any freedom. Besides, as every Arabian child\r\nsucks sugar-cane from morning to night, the children always attract\r\nafter them legions of flies, which besides being loathsome are noxious,\r\nfor they spread the Egyptian infection of inflammation of the eyes. For\r\nthis reason the servants attempted to disperse the children, but Nell\r\nstood in their defense and, what is more, distributed among the\r\nyoungest \"helou,\" that is, sweetmeats, which gained for her their great\r\nlove but also increased their number.\r\n\r\nAfter three days the joint excursions began; partly on the narrow-gauge\r\nrailways of which the English had built quite a number in Medinet\r\nel-Fayûm, partly on donkeys, and sometimes on camels. It appeared that\r\nin the praises bestowed on those animals by Idris there was indeed a\r\ngreat deal of exaggeration, for not merely kidney-beans but even people\r\ncould not easily keep on the saddles; but there was also some truth.\r\nThe camels in reality belonged to the variety known as \"hegin,\" that\r\nis, for carrying passengers, and were fed with good durra (the local or\r\nSyrian maize) so that the humps were fat and they appeared so willing\r\nto speed that it was necessary to check them. The Sudânese, Idris and\r\nGebhr, gained, notwithstanding the wild glitter of their eyes, the\r\nconfidence and hearts of the company, and this through their great\r\nwillingness to serve and their extraordinary care over Nell. Gebhr\r\nalways had a cruel and a trifle bestial expression of face, but Idris,\r\nquickly perceiving that that little personage was the eye in the head\r\nof the whole company, declared at every opportunity that he cared more\r\nfor her than for his own soul. Mr. Rawlinson conjectured indeed, that,\r\nthrough Nell, Idris wanted to reach his pocket, but believing at the\r\nsame time that there was not in the world a person who could not but\r\nlove his only child, he was grateful to him and did not stint himself\r\nin giving \"bakshish.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of five days the party visited the near by ruins of the\r\nancient city of Crocodilopolis, where at one time the Egyptians\r\nworshipped a deity called Sobk, which had a human form with the head of\r\na crocodile. Afterwards an excursion was made to the Hanar pyramids and\r\nthe remains of the Labyrinth. The longest trip was on camel-back to\r\nLake Karûn. Its northern shore was a stark desert, on which there were\r\nruins of former Egyptian cities, but no trace of life. On the other\r\nhand, on the southern shore stretched a fertile country, magnificent,\r\nwith shores overgrown by heather and reeds and teeming with pelicans,\r\nflamingoes, herons, wild geese, and ducks. Only here did Stas find an\r\nopportunity for displaying his marksmanship. The shooting from a common\r\nrifle as well as from the short rifle was so extraordinary that after\r\nevery shot could be heard the astonished smacking of the lips of Idris\r\nand the Arabian rowers, and the falling of the birds into the water was\r\naccompanied by exclamations of \"Bismillah\" and \"Mashallah.\"\r\n\r\nThe Arabians assured them that on the opposite desert-shore were many\r\nwolves and hyenas, and that by tossing amid the sand dunes the carcass\r\nof a sheep one might get within shooting range. In consequence of these\r\nassurances Pan Tarkowski and Stas passed two nights on the desert near\r\nthe ruins of Dima. But the first sheep was stolen by Bedouins as soon\r\nas the hunters left it; while the second lured only a lame jackal,\r\nwhich Stas brought down. Further hunting had to be postponed as the\r\ntime had arrived for both engineers to inspect the works conducted at\r\nBahr Yûsuf near El-Lahûn, southeast from Medinet.\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlinson waited only for the arrival of Madame Olivier.\r\nUnfortunately, in place of her, came a letter from the physician\r\ninforming them that the former erysipelas in the face had recurred\r\nafter the bite, and that the patient for a long time would be unable to\r\nleave Port Said. The situation actually became distressing. It was\r\nimpossible to take with them the children, old Dinah, the tents, and\r\nall the servants, if only for the reason that the engineers were to be\r\none day here, another there, and might receive requests to go as far as\r\nthe great canal of Ibrâhimiyeh. In view of this, after a short\r\nconsultation Mr. Rawlinson decided to leave Nell under the care of old\r\nDinah and Stas, together with the Italian consular agent and the local\r\n\"Mudir\" (governor) with whom he had previously become acquainted. He\r\npromised also to Nell, who grieved to part from her father, that from\r\nall the nearer localities he would with Pan Tarkowski rush to Medinet,\r\nor if they found some noteworthy sight, would summon the children to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"We shall take with us, Chamis,\" he said, \"whom in a certain case we\r\nshall send for you. Let Dinah always keep Nell's company, but as Nell\r\ndoes with her whatever she pleases, do you, Stas, watch over both.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be sure, sir,\" answered Stas, \"that I shall watch over Nell,\r\nas over my own sister. She has Saba, and I a short rifle, so let any\r\none try to harm her--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not about that that I am concerned,\" said Mr. Rawlinson. \"Saba\r\nand the short rifle will certainly not be necessary for you. You will\r\nbe so good as to protect her from fatigue and at the same time take\r\ncare she does not catch cold. I have asked the consul in case she feels\r\nunwell to summon a doctor from Cairo immediately. We shall send Chamis\r\nhere for news as frequently as possible. The Mudir will also visit you.\r\nI expect, besides, that our absence will never be very long.\"\r\n\r\nPan Tarkowski also was not sparing in his admonitions to Stas. He told\r\nhim that Nell did not require his defense as there was not in Medinet\r\nnor in the whole province of El-Fayûm any savage people or wild\r\nanimals. To think of such things would be ridiculous and unworthy of a\r\nboy who had begun his fourteenth year. So he was to be solicitous and\r\nheedful only that they did not undertake anything on their own account,\r\nand more particularly excursions with Nell on camels, on which a ride\r\nwas fatiguing.\r\n\r\nBut Nell, hearing this, made such a sad face that Pan Tarkowski had to\r\nplacate her.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" he said, stroking her hair, \"you will ride camels, but\r\nwith us or towards us, if we send Chamis for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when alone are we not allowed to make an excursion, even though\r\nsuch a tiny bit of a one?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\nAnd she began to show on her finger about how little an excursion she\r\nwas concerned. The parents in the end agreed that they could ride on\r\ndonkeys, not on camels, and not to ruins, where they might easily fall\r\ninto some hole, but over roads of adjacent fields and towards the\r\ngardens beyond the city. The dragoman, together with other Cook\r\nservants, was always to accompany the children.\r\n\r\nAfter this both gentlemen departed, but they left for a place near by,\r\nHanaret el-Matka, so that after ten hours they returned to pass the\r\nnight in Medinet. This was repeated the succeeding few days until they\r\nhad inspected all the nearest work. Afterwards, when their employment\r\nrequired their presence at more distant places, Chamis arrived in the\r\nnight time, and early in the following morning took Stas and Nell to\r\nthose little cities, in which their parents wanted to show them\r\nsomething of interest. The children spent the greater part of the day\r\nwith their parents and before sunset returned to the camp at Medinet.\r\nThere were, however, days on which Chamis did not come, and then Nell,\r\nnotwithstanding the society of Stas, and Saba in whom she continually\r\ndiscovered some new traits, looked with longing for a messenger. In\r\nthis manner the time passed until Twelfth Night, on the day of which\r\nfestival both engineers returned to Medinet.\r\n\r\nTwo days later they went away again, announcing that they left this\r\ntime for a longer period and in all probability would reach as far as\r\nBenisueif, and from there to El-Fachn, where a canal of the same name\r\nbegins, going far south alongside of the Nile.\r\n\r\nGreat, therefore, was the astonishment of the children, when on the\r\nthird day at eleven o'clock in the morning Chamis appeared in Medinet.\r\nStas met him first as he went to the pasturage to look at the camels.\r\nChamis conversed with Idris, and only told Stas that he came for him\r\nand Nell and that he would come immediately to the camp to inform them\r\nwhere they, at the request of the older gentlemen, were to go. Stas ran\r\nat once with the good news to Nell, whom he found playing with Saba\r\nbefore the tent.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know--Chamis is here!\" he cried from a distance.\r\n\r\nAnd Nell began at once to hop, holding both feet together, as little\r\ngirls do when skipping the rope.\r\n\r\n\"We shall go! We shall go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. We shall go, and far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" she asked, brushing aside with her little hands a tuft of hair\r\nwhich fell over her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Chamis said that in a moment he would come here and tell\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know it is far?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I heard Idris say that he and Gebhr would start at once with\r\nthe camels. That means that we shall go by rail and shall find the\r\ncamels at the place where our parents will be, and from there we shall\r\nmake some kind of an excursion.\"\r\n\r\nThe tuft of hair, owing to the continual hops, covered again not only\r\nNell's eyes but her whole face, her feet bounding as if they were made\r\nof India rubber.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later, Chamis came and bowed to both.\r\n\r\n\"Khanage (young master),\" he said, \"we leave after three hours by the\r\nfirst train.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Gharak el-Sultani, and from there with the older gentlemen on\r\ncamel-back to Wâdi Rayân.\"\r\n\r\nStas' heart beat with joy, but at the same time Chamis' words surprised\r\nhim. He knew that Wâdi Rayân was a great valley among sandy hills\r\nrising on the Libyan Desert on the south and southwest of Medinet,\r\nwhile on the other hand Pan Tarkowski and Mr. Rawlinson announced on\r\ntheir departure that they were going in a directly opposite direction,\r\ntowards the Nile.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened?\" asked Stas. \"Then my father and Mr. Rawlinson are\r\nnot in Benisueif but in El-Gharak?\"\r\n\r\n\"It happened thus,\" replied Chamis.\r\n\r\n\"But they ordered us to write to them at El-Fachn.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a letter the senior effendi explains why they are in El-Gharak.\"\r\n\r\nAnd for a while he searched on his person for the letter, after which\r\nhe exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Nabi! (prophet) I left the letter in a pouch with the camels. I\r\nwill run at once before Idris and Gebhr depart.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he ran towards the camels. In the meantime the children, with\r\nDinah, began to prepare for the journey. As it looked as if the\r\nexcursion would be a long one, Dinah packed several dresses, some\r\nlinen, and warmer clothing for Nell. Stas thought of himself, and\r\nespecially did not forget about the short rifle and cartridges, hoping\r\nthat among the sand dunes of Wâdi Rayân he might encounter wolves and\r\nhyenas.\r\n\r\nChamis did not return until an hour later; he was covered with\r\nperspiration and so fatigued that for a while he could not catch his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\"I did not find the camels,\" he said. \"I chased after them, but in\r\nvain. But that does not matter as we shall find the letter and the\r\neffendis themselves in El-Gharak. Is Dinah to go with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it would be better if she remained. The older gentlemen said\r\nnothing about her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they announced on leaving that Dinah was always to accompany the\r\nlittle lady. So she shall ride now.\"\r\n\r\nChamis bowed, placing his hand on his heart and said:\r\n\r\n\"Let us hasten, sir, for otherwise the katr (train) will set off.\"\r\n\r\nThe baggage was ready, so they were at the station on time. The\r\ndistance between Medinet and Gharak is not more than nineteen miles,\r\nbut the trains on the branch line which connects those localities move\r\nslowly and the stops were uncommonly frequent. If Stas had been alone\r\nhe undoubtedly would have preferred to ride camel-back as he calculated\r\nthat Idris and Gebhr, having started two hours before the train, would\r\nbe earlier in El-Gharak. But for Nell such a ride would be too long;\r\nand the little guardian, who took very much to heart the warnings of\r\nboth parents, did not want to expose the little girl to fatigue. After\r\nall the time passed for both so quickly that they scarcely noticed when\r\nthey stopped in Gharak.\r\n\r\nThe little station, from which Englishmen usually make excursions to\r\nWâdi Rayân, was almost entirely deserted. They found only a few veiled\r\nwomen, with baskets of mandarin oranges, two unknown Bedouin camel\r\ndrivers, together with Idris and Gebhr, with seven camels, one of which\r\nwas heavily packed. Of Pan Tarkowski and Mr. Rawlinson there was no\r\ntrace.\r\n\r\nBut Idris in this manner explained their absence.\r\n\r\n\"The older gentlemen went into the desert to pitch the tents which they\r\nbrought with them from Etsah, and ordered us to follow them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how shall we find them among the sand-hills?\" asked Stas.\r\n\r\n\"They sent guides who will lead us to them.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this he pointed to the Bedouins. The older of them bowed, rubbed\r\nwith his finger the one eye which he possessed, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Our camels are not so fat but are not less speedy than yours. After an\r\nhour we shall be there.\"\r\n\r\nStas was glad that he would pass the night on the desert, but Nell felt\r\na certain disappointment, for she had been certain that she would meet\r\nher papa in Gharak.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the station-master, a sleepy Egyptian with a red fez\r\nand dark spectacles, approached them, and, not having anything else to\r\ndo, began to stare at the European children.\r\n\r\n\"These are the children of those Englishmen who rode this morning with\r\nrifles to the desert,\" said Idris, placing Nell on the saddle.\r\n\r\nStas, handing his short rifle to Chamis, sat beside her, for the saddle\r\nwas wide and had the shape of a palanquin without a roof. Dinah sat\r\nbehind Chamis, the others took separate camels, and the party started.\r\n\r\nIf the station-master had stared at them longer he might perhaps have\r\nwondered that those Englishmen, of whom Idris spoke, rode directly to\r\nthe ruins on the south, while this party at once directed its movements\r\ntowards Talei, in a different direction. But the station-master before\r\nthat time had returned home as no other train arrived that day at\r\nGharak.\r\n\r\nThe hour was five in the afternoon. The weather was splendid. The sun\r\nhad already passed on that side of the Nile and declined over the\r\ndesert, sinking into the golden and purple twilight glowing on the\r\nwestern side of the sky. The atmosphere was so permeated with the\r\nroseate luster that the eyes blinked from its superfluity. The fields\r\nassumed a lily tint, while the distant sand-hills, strongly relieved\r\nagainst the background of the twilight, had a hue of pure amethyst. The\r\nworld lost the traits of reality and appeared to be one play of\r\nsupernal lights.\r\n\r\nWhile they rode over a verdant and cultivated region, the guide, a\r\nBedouin, conducted the caravan with a moderate pace. But with the\r\nmoment that the hard sand creaked under the feet of the camels,\r\neverything changed.\r\n\r\n\"Yalla! Yalla!\" suddenly yelled wild voices.\r\n\r\nAnd simultaneously could be heard the swish of whips and the camels,\r\nhaving changed from an ambling pace into a full gallop, began to speed\r\nlike the whirlwind, throwing up with their feet the sand and gravel of\r\nthe desert.\r\n\r\n\"Yalla! Yalla!\"\r\n\r\nThe ambling pace of a camel jolts more, while the gallop with which\r\nthis animal seldom runs, swings more; so the children enjoyed this mad\r\nride. But it is known that even in a swing, too much rapid movement\r\ncauses dizziness. Accordingly, after a certain time, when the speed did\r\nnot cease, Nell began to get dizzy and her eyes grew dim.\r\n\r\n\"Stas, why are we flying so?\" she exclaimed, turning to her companion.\r\n\r\n\"I think that they allowed them to get into too much of a gallop and\r\nnow cannot check them,\" answered Stas.\r\n\r\nBut observing that the little girl's face was becoming pale, he shouted\r\nat the Bedouins, running ahead, to slacken their pace. His calls,\r\nhowever, had only this result: that again resounded the cries of\r\n\"Yalla,\" and the animals increased their speed.\r\n\r\nThe boy thought at first that the Bedouins did not hear him, but when\r\non his repeated orders there was no response and when Gebhr, who was\r\nriding behind him, did not cease lashing the camel on which he sat with\r\nNell, he thought it was not the camels that were so spirited but that\r\nthe men for some reason unknown to him were in a great hurry.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him that they might have taken the wrong road and that,\r\ndesiring to make up for lost time, they now were speeding from fear\r\nthat the older gentlemen might scold them because of a late arrival.\r\nBut after a while he understood that such could not be the case, as Mr.\r\nRawlinson would have been more angered for unnecessarily fatiguing\r\nNell. Then what did it mean? And why did they not obey his commands? In\r\nthe heart of the boy anger and fear for Nell began to rise.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" he shouted with his whole strength, addressing Gebhr.\r\n\r\n\"Ouskout! (be silent)!\" the Sudânese yelled in reply; and they sped on.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt night falls about six o'clock, so the twilight soon became\r\nextinct and after a certain time the great moon, ruddy from the\r\nreflection of the twilight, rolled on and illuminated the desert with a\r\ngentle light.\r\n\r\nIn the silence could be heard only the heavy breathing of the camels,\r\nthe rapid hoof-beats on the sand, and at times the swish of whips. Nell\r\nwas so tired that Stas had to hold her on the saddle. Every little\r\nwhile she asked how soon they would reach then destination, and\r\nevidently was buoyed up only by the hope of an early meeting with her\r\nfather. But in vain both children gazed around. One hour passed, then\r\nanother; neither tents nor camp-fires could be seen.\r\n\r\nThen the hair rose on Stas' head, for he realized that they were\r\nkidnapped.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Rawlinson and Tarkowski actually expected the children, not\r\namidst the sand-hills of Wâdi Rayân, where they had no need or desire\r\nto ride, but in an entirely different direction, in the city of\r\nEl-Fachn on a canal of the same name at which they were examining the\r\nwork finished before the end of the year. The distance between El-Fachn\r\nand Medinet in a straight line is almost twenty-eight miles. As,\r\nhowever, there is no direct connection and it is necessary to ride to\r\nEl-Wasta, which doubles the distance, Mr. Rawlinson, after looking over\r\nthe railway guide, made the following calculations.\r\n\r\n\"Chamis left the night before last,\" he said to Pan Tarkowski, \"and in\r\nEl-Wasta he caught the train from Cairo; he was therefore in Medinet\r\nyesterday. It would take an hour to pack up. Leaving at noon they\r\nwould have to wait for the night train running along the Nile, and\r\nas I do not permit Nell to ride at night, they would leave this\r\nmorning and will be here immediately after sunset.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Pan Tarkowski, \"Chamis must rest a little, and though Stas\r\nis indeed impulsive, nevertheless, where Nell is concerned you may\r\nalways depend upon him. Moreover, I sent him a postal card not to ride\r\nduring the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"A brave lad, and I trust him,\" answered Mr. Rawlinson.\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth, so do I. Stas with his various faults has an\r\nupright character and never lies, for he is brave, and only a coward\r\nlies. He also does not lack energy and if in time he acquires a calm\r\njudgment, I think he will be able to take care of himself in this\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. As to judgment, were you judicious at his age?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must confess that I was not,\" replied Pan Tarkowski, laughing, \"but\r\nI was not so self-confident as he.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will pass. Meanwhile, be happy that you have such a boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you that you have such a sweet and dear creature as Nell.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God bless her!\" answered Mr. Rawlinson with emotion.\r\n\r\nThe two friends warmly shook hands, after which they sat down to\r\nexamine the plans and the report of expenditures connected with the\r\nwork. At this occupation the time passed until evening.\r\n\r\nAbout six o'clock, when night fell, they were at the station, strolling\r\nalong the walk, and resumed their conversation about the children.\r\n\r\n\"Superb weather, but cool,\" said Mr. Rawlinson. \"I wonder if Nell took\r\nsome warm clothing with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stas will think of that, and Dinah also.\"\r\n\r\n\"I regret, nevertheless, that instead of bringing them here, we did not\r\ngo to Medinet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will recollect that that is just what I advised.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, and if it were not that we are to go from here farther south,\r\nI would have agreed. I calculated, however, that the trip would take\r\ntoo much time and on the whole it would be best to have the children\r\nhere. Finally, I will confess to you that Chamis suggested the idea to\r\nme. He announced that he prodigiously yearned for them and would be\r\nhappy if I sent for both. I am not surprised that he should be so\r\nattached to them.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by signals announcing the approach\r\nof the train. After an interval the fiery eyes of the locomotive\r\nappeared in the darkness, and at the same time could be heard its puffs\r\nand whistle.\r\n\r\nA row of lighted coaches drew alongside the platform, quivered, and\r\nstood still.\r\n\r\n\"I did not see them in any window,\" said Mr. Rawlinson.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they are seated further inside and surely will come out\r\nimmediately.\"\r\n\r\nThe passengers began to alight, but they were mainly Arabs, as El-Fachn\r\nhas nothing interesting to see except beautiful groves of palms and\r\nacacias. The children did not arrive.\r\n\r\n\"Chamis either did not make connections in El-Wasta,\" declared Pan\r\nTarkowski, with a shade of ill-humor, \"or after a night of travel\r\noverslept himself, and they will not arrive until to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" answered Mr. Rawlinson, with uneasiness, \"but it also\r\nmay be possible that one of them is sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case Stas would have telegraphed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows but that we may find a despatch in the hotel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the hotel no news awaited them. Mr. Rawlinson became more and\r\nmore uneasy.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think could have happened?\" said Pan Tarkowski. \"If Chamis\r\noverslept himself, he would not admit it to the children and would come\r\nto them to-day and tell them that they are to leave to-morrow. To us he\r\nwill excuse himself by claiming that he misunderstood our orders. In\r\nany event, I shall telegraph to Stas.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I to the Mudir of Fayûm.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while the despatches were sent. There was indeed no cause for\r\nuneasiness; nevertheless, in waiting for an answer the engineers passed\r\na bad night, and early morning found them on their feet.\r\n\r\nThe answer from the Mudir came about ten o'clock and was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Verified at station. Children left yesterday for Gharak el-Sultani.\"\r\n\r\nIt can easily be understood what amazement and anger possessed the\r\nparents at this unexpected intelligence. For some time they gazed at\r\neach other, as if they did not understand the words of the despatch;\r\nafter which Pan Tarkowski, who was an impulsive person, struck the\r\ntable with his hand and said:\r\n\r\n\"That was Stas' whim, but I will cure him of such whims.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not expect that of him,\" answered Nell's father.\r\n\r\nBut after a moment he asked:\r\n\r\n\"But what of Chamis?\"\r\n\r\n\"He either did not find them and does not know what to do or else rode\r\nafter them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later they started for Medinet. In camp they ascertained that\r\nthe camels were gone, and at the station it was confirmed that Chamis\r\nleft with the children for El-Gharak. The affair became darker and\r\ndarker and it could be cleared up only in El-Gharak.\r\n\r\nIn fact, only at that station did the dreadful truth begin to dawn.\r\n\r\nThe station-master, the same sleepy one with dark spectacles and red\r\nfez, told them that he saw a boy about fourteen years old and an\r\neight-year-old girl with an old negress, who rode towards the desert.\r\nHe did not remember whether there were eight or nine camels altogether,\r\nbut observed that one was heavily packed as if for a long journey, and\r\nthe two Bedouins also had big pack-saddles. He recollected also that\r\nwhen he stared at the caravan one of the camel drivers, a Sudânese,\r\nsaid to him that those were the children of the Englishmen who before\r\nthat had gone to Wâdi Rayân.\r\n\r\n\"Did those Englishmen return?\" asked Pan Tarkowski.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They returned yesterday with two slain wolves,\" answered the\r\nstation-master; \"and I was astonished that they did not return with the\r\nchildren. But I did not ask the reason as that was not my affair.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this he left to attend to his duties.\r\n\r\nDuring this narrative Mr. Rawlinson's face became white as paper.\r\nGazing at his friend with a wild look, he took off his hat, pressed his\r\nhand to his forehead, covered with perspiration, and staggered as if he\r\nwere about to fall.\r\n\r\n\"Be a man, Rawlinson!\" exclaimed Pan Tarkowski. \"Our children are\r\nkidnapped. It is necessary to rescue them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nell! Nell!\" repeated the unhappy Englishman.\r\n\r\n\"Nell and Stas! It was not Stas' fault. Both were enticed by trickery\r\nand kidnapped. Who knows why? Perhaps for a ransom. Chamis undoubtedly\r\nis in the plot, and Idris and Gebhr also.\"\r\n\r\nHere he recalled what Fatma had said about both Sudânese belonging to\r\nthe Dongolese tribe, in which the Mahdi was born, and that Chadigi, the\r\nfather of Chamis, came from the same tribe. At this recollection his\r\nheart for a moment became inert in his breast for he understood that\r\nthe children were abducted not for a ransom but as an exchange for\r\nSmain's family.\r\n\r\n\"But what will the tribesmen of the ill-omened prophet do with them?\r\nThey cannot hide them on the desert or anywhere on the banks of the\r\nNile, for they all would die of hunger and thirst on the desert, and\r\nthey certainly would be apprehended on the Nile. Perhaps they will try\r\nto join the Mahdi.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this thought filled Pan Tarkowski with dismay, but the energetic\r\nex-soldier soon recovered and began in his mind to review all that\r\nhappened and at the same time seek means of rescue.\r\n\r\n\"Fatma,\" he reasoned, \"had no cause to revenge herself either upon us\r\nor our children. If they have been kidnapped it was evidently for the\r\npurpose of placing them in the hands of Smain. In no case does death\r\nthreaten them. And this is a fortune in misfortune; still a terrible\r\njourney awaits them which might be disastrous for them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at once he shared these thoughts with his friend, after which he\r\nspoke thus:\r\n\r\n\"Idris and Gebhr, like savage and foolish men, imagine that followers\r\nof the Mahdi are not far, while Khartûm, which the Mahdi reached, is\r\nabout one thousand two hundred and forty miles from here. This journey\r\nthey must make along the Nile and not keep at a distance from it as\r\notherwise the camels and people would perish from thirst. Ride at once\r\nto Cairo and demand of the Khedive that despatches be sent to all the\r\nmilitary outposts and that a pursuit be organized right and left along\r\nthe river. Offer a large reward to the sheiks near the banks for the\r\ncapture of the fugitives. In the villages let all be detained who\r\napproach for water. In this manner Idris and Gebhr must fall into the\r\nhands of the authorities and we shall recover the children.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlinson had already recovered his composure.\r\n\r\n\"I shall go,\" he said. \"Those miscreants forgot that Wolseley's English\r\narmy, hurrying to Gordon's relief, is already on the way and will cut\r\nthem off from the Mahdi. They will not escape. They cannot escape. I\r\nshall send a despatch to our minister in a moment, and afterwards go\r\nmyself. What do you intend to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall telegraph for a furlough, and not waiting for an answer, shall\r\nfollow then trail by way of the Nile to Nubia, to attend to the\r\npursuit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall meet, as from Cairo I shall do the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! And now to work!\"\r\n\r\n\"With God's help!\" answered Mr. Rawlinson.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the camels swept like a hurricane over the sands\r\nglistening in the moonlight. A deep night fell. The moon, at the\r\nbeginning as big as a wheel and ruddy, became pale and rolled on high.\r\nThe distant desert hills were enveloped with silvery vapors like muslin\r\nwhich, not veiling their view, transformed them as if into luminous\r\nphenomena. From time to time from beyond the rocks scattered here and\r\nthere came the piteous whining of jackals.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed. Stas held Nell in his arms and supported her,\r\nendeavoring in this way to allay the fatiguing jolts of the mad ride.\r\nThe little girl began more and more frequently to ask him why they were\r\nspeeding so and why they did not see the tents and their papas. Stas\r\nfinally determined to tell her the truth, which sooner or later he\r\nwould have to disclose.\r\n\r\n\"Nell,\" he said, \"pull off a glove and drop it, unobserved, on the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Stas?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he pressed her to himself and answered with a kind of tenderness\r\nunusual to him:\r\n\r\n\"Do what I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nNell held Stas with one hand and feared to let him go, but she overcame\r\nthe difficulty in this manner: she began to pull the glove with her\r\nteeth, each finger separately, and, finally taking it off entirely, she\r\ndropped it on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"After a time, throw the other,\" again spoke Stas. \"I already have\r\ndropped mine, but yours will be easier to observe for they are bright.\"\r\n\r\nAnd observing that the little girl gazed at him with an inquiring look,\r\nhe continued:\r\n\r\n\"Don't get frightened, Nell. It may be that we will not meet your or my\r\nfather at all--and that these foul people have kidnapped us. But don't\r\nfear--for if it is so, then pursuers will follow them. They will\r\novertake them and surely rescue us. I told you to drop the gloves so\r\nthat the pursuers may find clews. In the meanwhile we can do nothing,\r\nbut later I shall contrive something--Surely, I shall contrive\r\nsomething; only do not fear, and trust me.\"\r\n\r\nBut Nell, learning that she should not see her papa and that they are\r\nflying somewhere, far in the desert, began to tremble from fright and\r\ncry, clinging at the same time close to Stas and asking him amid her\r\nsobs why they kidnapped them and where they were taking them. He\r\ncomforted her as well as he could--almost in the same words with which\r\nhis father comforted Mr. Rawlinson. He said that their parents\r\nthemselves would follow in pursuit and would notify all the garrisons\r\nalong the Nile. In the end he assured her that whatever might happen,\r\nhe would never abandon her and would always defend her.\r\n\r\nBut her grief and longing for her father were stronger even than fear;\r\nso for a long time she did not cease to weep--and thus they flew, both\r\nsad, on a bright night, over the pale sands of the desert.\r\n\r\nSorrow and fear not only oppressed Stas' heart, but also shame. He was\r\nnot indeed to blame for what had happened, yet he recalled the former\r\nboastfulness for which his father so often had rebuked him. Formerly he\r\nwas convinced that there was no situation to which he was not equal; he\r\nconsidered himself a kind of unvanquished swashbuckler, and was ready\r\nto challenge the whole world. Now he understood that he was a small\r\nboy, with whom everybody could do as he pleased, and that he was\r\nspeeding in spite, of his will on a camel merely because that camel was\r\ndriven from behind by a half-savage Sudânese. He felt terribly\r\nhumiliated and did not see any way of resisting. He had to admit to\r\nhimself that he plainly feared those men and the desert, and what he\r\nand Nell might meet.\r\n\r\nHe promised sincerely not only to her but to himself that he would\r\nwatch over and defend her even at the cost of his own life.\r\n\r\nNell, weary with weeping and the mad ride, which had lasted already six\r\nhours, finally began to doze, and at times fell asleep. Stas, knowing\r\nthat whoever fell from a galloping camel might be killed on the spot,\r\ntied her to himself with a rope which he found on the saddle. But after\r\nsome time it seemed to him that the speed of the camels became less\r\nrapid, though now they flew over smooth and soft sands. In the distance\r\ncould be seen only the shifting hills, while on the plain began the\r\nnocturnal illusions common to the desert. The moon shone in the heaven\r\nmore and more palely and in the meantime there appeared before them,\r\ncreeping low, strange rosy clouds, entirely transparent, woven only\r\nfrom light. They formed mysteriously and moved ahead as if pushed by\r\nthe light breeze. Stas saw how the burnooses of the Bedouins and the\r\ncamels became roseate when they rode into that illuminated space, and\r\nafterwards the whole caravan was enveloped in a delicate, rosy luster.\r\nAt times the clouds assumed an azure hue and thus it continued until\r\nthe hills were reached.\r\n\r\nNear the hills the speed of the camels slackened yet more. All about\r\ncould be seen rocks protruding from sandy knolls or strewn in wild\r\ndisorder amidst the sand dunes. The ground became stony. They crossed a\r\nfew hollows, sown with stone and resembling the dried-up beds of\r\nrivers. At times their road was barred by ravines about which they had\r\nto make a detour. The animals began to step carefully, moving their\r\nlegs with precision as if in a dance, among the dry and hard bushes\r\nformed by roses of Jericho with which the dunes and rocks were\r\nabundantly covered. Time and again some of the camels would stumble and\r\nit was apparent that it was due to them to give them rest.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Bedouins stopped in a sunken pass, and dismounting from\r\nthe saddles, proceeded to untie the packs. Idris and Gebhr followed\r\ntheir example. They began to attend to the camels, to loosen the\r\nsaddle-girths, remove the supplies of provisions, and seek flat stones\r\non which to build a fire. There was no wood or dried dung, which Arabs\r\nuse, but Chamis, son of Chadigi, plucked roses of Jericho and built of\r\nthem a big pile to which he set fire. For some time, while the Sudânese\r\nwere engaged with the camels, Stas and Nell and her nurse, old Dinah,\r\nfound themselves together, somewhat apart. But Dinah was more\r\nfrightened than the children and could not say a word. She only wrapped\r\nNell in a warm plaid and sitting close to her began with a moan to kiss\r\nher little hands. Stas at once asked Chamis the meaning of what had\r\nhappened, but he, laughing, only displayed his white teeth, and went to\r\ngather more roses of Jericho. Idris, questioned afterwards, answered\r\nwith these words: \"You will see!\" and threatened him with his finger.\r\nWhen the fire of roses, which smoldered more than blazed, finally\r\nglowed they all surrounded it in a circle, except Gebhr who remained\r\nwith the camels, and they began to eat cakes of maize, and dried mutton\r\nand goats' meat. The children, famished by the long journey, also ate,\r\nthough at the same time Nell's eyes were closed by sleepiness. But in\r\nthe meantime, in the faint light of the fire, appeared dark-skinned\r\nGebhr and with glittering eyes he held up two bright little gloves and\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"Whose are these?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine,\" answered Nell with a sleepy and tired voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yours, little viper?\" the Sudânese hissed through set teeth. \"Then you\r\nmark the road so that your father can know where to pursue us.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he struck her with a courbash, a terrible Arabian whip,\r\nwhich cuts even the hide of a camel. Nell, though she was wrapped in a\r\nthick plaid, shrieked from pain and fright, but Gebhr was unable to\r\nstrike her a second time, for at that moment Stas leaped like a\r\nwildcat, butted Gebhr's breast with his head, and afterwards clutched\r\nhim by the throat.\r\n\r\nIt happened so unexpectedly that the Sudânese fell upon his back and\r\nStas on top of him, and both began to roll on the ground. The boy was\r\nexceptionally strong for his age, nevertheless Gebhr soon overcame him.\r\nHe first pulled his hands from his throat, after which he turned him\r\nover with face to the ground and, pressing heavily on his neck with his\r\nfist, he began to lash his back with the courbash.\r\n\r\nThe shrieks and tears of Nell, who seizing the hand of the savage at\r\nthe same time begged him \"to forgive\" Stas, would not have availed if\r\nIdris had not unexpectedly come to the boy's assistance. He was older\r\nthan Gebhr and from the beginning of the flight from Gharak el-Sultani\r\nall complied with his orders. Now he snatched the courbash from his\r\nbrother's hand and, pushing him away, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Away, you fool!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll flog that scorpion!\" answered Gebhr, gnashing his teeth.\r\n\r\nBut at this, Idris seized his cloak at the breast and gazing into his\r\neyes began to say in a threatening though quiet voice:\r\n\r\n\"The noble* [* All relatives of the Mahdi were termed \"noble.\"]  Fatma\r\nforbade us to do any harm to those children, for they interceded for\r\nher--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll flog him!\" iterated Gebhr.\r\n\r\n\"And I tell you that you shall not raise the courbash at either of\r\nthem. If you do, for every blow, I shall give you ten.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to shake him like a bough of a palm, after which he thus\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"Those children are the property of Smain and if either of them does\r\nnot reach him alive, the Mahdi himself (May God prolong his days\r\ninfinitely!) would command you to be hung. Do you understand, you fool?\"\r\n\r\nThe name of the Mahdi created such a great impression upon all his\r\nbelievers that Gebhr drooped his head at once and began to repeat as if\r\nwith fear:\r\n\r\n\"Allah akbar! Allah akbar!\"* [* This cry means, \"God is great\"; but\r\nArabs utter it in moments of fear, summoning aid.]\r\n\r\nStas rose, panting and whipped, but felt that if his father could have\r\nseen and heard him at that moment he would have been proud of him, for\r\nhe had not only leaped to save Nell, without thinking, but now, though\r\nthe blows of the courbash burnt him like fire, he did not think of his\r\nown pain but instead began to console and ask the little girl whether\r\nthe blow had injured her.\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards he said:\r\n\r\n\"Whatever I got, I got, but he will never attack you. Oh, if I only had\r\nsome weapon!\"\r\n\r\nThe little woman entwined his neck with her arms and dampening his\r\ncheeks with tears began to assure him that it did not pain her very\r\nmuch and that she was crying not from pain but from sorrow for him. At\r\nthis Stas put his lips to her ear and whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Nell, I swear that, not because he whipped me, but because he struck\r\nyou, I shall not forgive him.\" With that the incident closed.\r\n\r\nAfter a certain time Gebhr and Idris, becoming reconciled, spread out\r\ntheir cloaks upon the ground and lay upon them, and Chamis soon\r\nfollowed their example. The Bedouins poured out durra for the camels,\r\nafter which, having mounted two unengaged camels, they rode in the\r\ndirection of the Nile. Nell, supporting her head on old Dinah's knee,\r\nfell asleep. The fire was dying out and soon could be heard only the\r\ngrinding of the durra in the camels' teeth. On high rolled small clouds\r\nwhich at times veiled the moon, but the night was clear. Beyond the\r\nrocks resounded the mournful whining of jackals.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours the Bedouins returned with the camels bearing leather\r\nbags filled with water. Having fed the fire, they sat on the sand and\r\ncommenced to eat. Their arrival awoke Stas, who previously had been\r\ndozing, as well as Chamis, son of Chadigi, and the two Sudânese. Then\r\nat the camp-fire began the following conversation:\r\n\r\n\"Can we start?\" Idris asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, because we must rest;--we and our camels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did any one see you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody. We reached the river between two villages. In the distance\r\ndogs barked.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be necessary always to go for water at midnight and draw it at\r\ndeserted places. Only let us get past the first 'challa' (cataract);\r\nbeyond that the villages are farther apart and they are more friendly\r\nto the prophet. A pursuing party will undoubtedly follow us.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Chamis turned over, with his back up, and resting his face on\r\nhis hands said:\r\n\r\n\"The Mehendes will first wait for the children in El-Fachn during the\r\nwhole night and until the following train; later they will go to Fayûm\r\nand from there to Gharak. Only there will they understand what has\r\nhappened and then they will have to return to Medinet to send words\r\nflying over the copper wire to cities on the Nile and to the\r\ncamel-corps which will pursue us. All that will take at least three\r\ndays. Therefore we do not need to tire our camels and can peacefully\r\n'drink smoke' from pipe-stems.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he pulled out a sprig of a rose of Jericho and lit his\r\npipe with it, while Idris began, according to the Arabian habit, to\r\nsmack his lips with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"You arranged it well, son of Chadigi,\" he said, \"but it is necessary\r\nfor us to take advantage of the time and to drive during those three\r\ndays and nights as far as possible southward. I shall breathe freely\r\nonly when we shall cross the desert between the Nile and Kharga (a\r\ngreat oasis west of the Nile). God grant that the camels hold out.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will hold out,\" declared one of the Bedouins.\r\n\r\n\"People also say,\" interposed Chamis, \"that the army of the Mahdi--may\r\nGod prolong his life--has already reached Assuan.\"\r\n\r\nHere Stas, who did not lose a word of this conversation and remembered\r\nalso what Idris had said to Gebhr, rose and said:\r\n\r\n\"The army of the Mahdi is below Khartûm.\"\r\n\r\n\"La! La! (no! no!)\" Chamis contradicted.\r\n\r\n\"Don't pay any attention to his words,\" Stas replied, \"for he not only\r\nhas a dark skin but also a dark brain. Although you bought fresh camels\r\nevery three days and rushed as you have done this day, you would not\r\nreach Khartûm for a month. And perhaps you do not know that an English,\r\nnot an Egyptian, army bars the road to you.\"\r\n\r\nThese words created a certain impression and Stas, observing this,\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"Before you find yourselves between the Nile and the great oasis all\r\nthe roads on the desert will be picketed by a line of army sentinels.\r\nWords over the copper wire speed quicker than camels. How will you be\r\nable to slip through?\"\r\n\r\n\"The desert is wide,\" answered one of the Bedouins.\r\n\r\n\"But you must keep close to the Nile.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can cross over, and when they seek us on this side we shall be on\r\nthe other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Words speeding over the copper wire will reach cities and villages on\r\nboth banks of the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi will send us an angel, who will place a finger on the eyes\r\nof the Englishmen and the Turks (Egyptians) and will screen us with his\r\nwings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Idris,\" said Stas, \"I do not address Chamis whose head is like an\r\nempty gourd, nor Gebhr who is a vile jackal, but you. I already know\r\nthat you want to carry us to the Mahdi and deliver us to Smain. But if\r\nyou are doing this for money, then know that the father of this little\r\n'bint' (girl) is richer than all the Sudânese put together.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what of it?\" interrupted Idris.\r\n\r\n\"What of it? Return voluntarily and the great Mehendi will not spare\r\nmoney for you, nor will my father either.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they will give us up to the Government, which will order us to be\r\nhung.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Idris. You undoubtedly will hang, but only in case they capture\r\nyou in the flight; and that surely will happen. But if you return, no\r\npunishment will be meted out to you, and besides you will be wealthy to\r\nthe end of your life. You know that the white people of Europe always\r\nkeep their word. Now I give you the word for both Mehendes that it will\r\nbe as I say.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Stas in reality was confident that his father and Mr. Rawlinson\r\nwould prefer to fulfil the promise made by him than expose both of\r\nthem, and especially Nell, to the terrible journey and yet more\r\nterrible life among the savage and maddened hordes of the Mahdi.\r\n\r\nSo with palpitating heart, he waited for the reply of Idris who was\r\nplunged in silence and only after a long interval said:\r\n\r\n\"You say that the father of the little 'bint' and yours will give us a\r\ngreat deal of money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can all their money open for us the gates of paradise which only\r\nthe blessing of the Mahdi can do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bismillah!\" shouted both Bedouins together with Chamis and Gebhr.\r\n\r\nStas at once lost all hope, for he knew that howsoever much the people\r\nin the East are greedy and venal, nevertheless when a true Mohammedan\r\nviews any matter from the standpoint of faith, there are not any\r\ntreasures in the world with which he can be tempted.\r\n\r\nIdris, encouraged by the shouts, continued, and evidently not for the\r\npurpose of replying to Stas, but with a view of gaining greater esteem\r\nand praise from his companions.\r\n\r\n\"We have the good fortune not only to belong to that tribe which gave\r\nthe holy prophet, but the noble Fatma and her children are his\r\nrelatives and the great Mahdi loves them. If we deliver you and the\r\nlittle 'bint' to him, he will exchange you for Fatma and her sons and\r\nwill bless us. Know that even the water, in which every morning\r\naccording to the precepts of the Koran he makes his ablutions, heals\r\nthe sick and eliminates sins; and think what his blessing can\r\naccomplish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bismillah!\" reiterated the Sudânese and Bedouins.\r\n\r\nBut Stas, clutching at the last plank for help, said:\r\n\r\n\"Then take me and let the Bedouins return with the little 'bint' For me\r\nthey will surrender Fatma and her sons.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is yet more certain that they will surrender her for you two.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the boy addressed Chamis:\r\n\r\n\"Your father shall answer for your conduct.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father is already in the desert, on his way to the prophet,\"\r\nretorted Chamis.\r\n\r\n\"Then they will capture and hang him.\"\r\n\r\nHere, however, Idris deemed it proper to give encouragement to his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n\"Those vultures,\" he said, \"which will pick the flesh from our bones\r\nmay not yet be hatched. We know what threatens us, but we are not\r\nchildren, and we know the desert of old. These men (here he pointed at\r\nthe Bedouins) were many times in Berber and are acquainted with roads\r\nover which only gazelles roam. There nobody will find us and nobody\r\nwill seek us. We must indeed turn for water to the Bahr Yûsuf and later\r\nto the Nile, but will do that in the night. Besides, do you think that\r\non the river there are no secret friends of the Mahdi? And I tell you\r\nthat the farther south we go the more of them we will find. There,\r\ntribes and their sheiks are only waiting for the favorable moment to\r\nseize the sword in defense of the true faith. These alone will supply\r\nwater, food, and camels, and lead astray the pursuit. In truth, we know\r\nthat it is far to the Mahdi, but we know also that every day brings us\r\nnearer to the sheep's hide on which the holy prophet kneels to pray.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bismillah!\" shouted his companions for the third tune.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that Idris' importance grew among them considerably.\r\nStas understood that all was lost; so, desiring at least to protect\r\nNell from the malice of the Sudânese, he said:\r\n\r\n\"After six hours the little lady reached here barely alive. How can you\r\nthink that she can endure such a journey? If she should die, I also\r\nwill die, and then with what will you come to the Mahdi?\"\r\n\r\nNow Idris could not find an answer. Stas, perceiving this, continued\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\"And how will the Mahdi and Smain receive you when they learn that for\r\nyour folly Fatma and her children must pay with their lives?\"\r\n\r\nBut the Sudânese had recovered himself and replied:\r\n\r\n\"I saw how you grasped Gebhr's throat. By Allah! you are a lion's whelp\r\nand will not die and she--\"\r\n\r\nHere he gazed at the little head of the sleeping girl resting on the\r\nknees of old Dinah and finished in a kind of strangely gentle voice:\r\n\r\n\"For her we will weave on the camel's hump a nest, as for a bird, that\r\nshe may not at all feel fatigue and that she may sleep on the road as\r\npeacefully as she is sleeping now.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this he walked towards the camels and with the Bedouins began to\r\nmake a seat for the little girl on the back of the best dromedary. At\r\nthis they chattered a great deal and quarrelled among themselves but\r\nfinally, with the aid of ropes, shaggy coverlets, and short bamboo\r\npoles they made something in the shape of a deep, immovable basket in\r\nwhich Nell could sit or lie down, but from which she could not fall.\r\nAbove this seat, so broad that Dinah also could be accommodated in it,\r\nthey stretched a linen awning.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Idris to Stas, \"quail's eggs could not crack in those\r\nhousings. The old woman will ride with the little lady to serve her day\r\nand night.--You will sit with me, but can ride near her and watch over\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nStas was glad that he had secured even this much. Pondering over the\r\nsituation, he came to the conclusion that in all probability they would\r\nbe captured before they reached the first cataract, and this thought\r\ngave him hope. In the meantime he wanted above all things to sleep; so\r\nhe promised himself that he would tie himself with some kind of rope to\r\nthe saddle, and, as he would not have to hold Nell, he could take a nap\r\nfor a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe night already became paler and the jackals ceased their whining\r\namid the passes. The caravan was to start immediately, but the\r\nSudânese, observing the dawn, went to a rock, a few paces away, and\r\nthere, conformably with the precepts of the Koran, began their morning\r\nablutions, using, however, sand instead of water, which they desired to\r\nsave. Afterwards resounded voices, saying the \"soubhg,\" or morning\r\nprayer. Amidst the deep silence plainly could be heard their words: \"In\r\nthe name of the compassionate and merciful God. Glory to the Lord, the\r\nsovereign of the world, compassionate and merciful on the day of\r\njudgment. Thee we worship and profess. Thee we implore for aid. Lead us\r\nover the road of those to whom thou dost not spare benefactions and\r\ngrace and not over the paths of sinners who have incurred Thy wrath and\r\nwho err. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Stas, hearing these voices, raised his eyes upwards and in that\r\ndistant region, amidst tawny, gloomy sands, began the prayer:\r\n\r\n\"We fly to Thy patronage, O Holy Mother of God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night faded. The men already had the saddles on the camels, when\r\nsuddenly they observed a desert wolf, which, with tail curled beneath\r\nit, rushed across the pass, about a hundred paces from the caravan, and\r\nreaching the opposite table-land, dashed ahead showing signs of fright\r\nas if it fled before some enemy. On the Egyptian deserts there are no\r\nwild animals before which wolves could feel any fear and for that\r\nreason this sight greatly alarmed the Sudânese Arabs. What could this\r\nbe? Was the pursuing party already approaching? One of the Bedouins\r\nquickly climbed on a rock, but he had barely glanced when he slipped\r\ndown yet more quickly.\r\n\r\n\"By the prophet!\" he exclaimed, confused and frightened, \"a lion is\r\nrushing towards us and is already close by!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then from beyond the rocks came a bass \"wow\" after which Stas and\r\nNell shouted together:\r\n\r\n\"Saba! Saba!\"\r\n\r\nAs in the Arabian language this means a lion, the Bedouins became\r\nfrightened yet more, but Chamis burst out laughing and said:\r\n\r\n\"I know that lion.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this he whistled drawlingly and in a moment the gigantic mastiff\r\ndashed among the camels. Seeing the children he leaped towards them.\r\nFrom joy he overturned Nell who extended her hands to him; he reared\r\nhimself on Stas; afterwards whining and barking he ran round both a few\r\ntimes, again overturned Nell, again reared himself on Stas, and finally\r\nlying down at their feet began to pant.\r\n\r\nHis sides were sunken, from his lolling tongue fell clots of froth;\r\nnevertheless he wagged his tail and raised his eyes full of love at\r\nNell as if he wanted to say: \"Your father ordered me to watch over you,\r\nso here I am.\"\r\n\r\nThe children sat close to him, one on each side, and began to pat him.\r\nThe two Bedouins, who never before saw a creature like this, gazed at\r\nhim with astonishment, repeating: \"On Allah! o kelb kebir!\" (\"By God!\r\nthat is a big dog!\") while he for some time lay quietly. Afterwards he\r\nraised his head, inhaled the air through his black nose resembling a\r\nbig truffle, scented, and jumped towards the extinct camp-fire, near\r\nwhich lay the remnants of food.\r\n\r\nIn the same moment goat's and lamb's bones began to crack and crumble\r\nas straw in his powerful teeth. After eight people, counting old Dinah\r\nand Nell, there was enough for such \"kelb kebir.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Sudânese were worried by his arrival and the two camel drivers,\r\ncalling Chamis to one side, began to speak to him with uneasiness and\r\neven with indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Iblis* [* Iblis, one of the names of the devil in the\r\nKoran.--_Translator's note_.] brought that dog here,\" exclaimed Gebhr,\r\n\"but in what manner did he find the children, since they came to Gharak\r\nby rail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely by the camel tracks,\" answered Chamis.\r\n\r\n\"It happened badly. Everybody who sees him with us will remember our\r\ncaravan and will point out where we went. We positively must get rid of\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\" asked Chamis.\r\n\r\n\"We have a rifle, so take it and shoot him in the head.\"\r\n\r\nIn a case of urgency, Chamis might be able, for Stas had several times\r\nopened and closed his weapon before him, but he was sorry for the dog\r\nof whom he was fond, having taken care of him before the arrival of the\r\nchildren at Medinet. He knew perfectly that the Sudânese had no idea\r\nhow to handle a weapon of the latest model and would be at a loss what\r\nto do with it.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't know how,\" he said, with a crafty smile, \"that little\r\n'nouzrani' (Christian) could kill the dog, but that rifle can fire\r\nseveral times in succession; so I do not advise you to put it in his\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid!\" replied Idris; \"he would shoot us like quails.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have knives,\" observed Gebhr.\r\n\r\n\"Try it, but remember that you have a throat which the dog will pull to\r\npieces before you stab him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what is to be done?\"\r\n\r\nChamis shrugged his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want to kill the dog? If you should afterwards bury him in\r\nthe sand, the hyenas will dig him out; the pursuers will find his bones\r\nand will know that we did not cross the Nile but made off in this\r\ndirection. Let him follow us. As often as the Bedouins go for water and\r\nwe hide in the passes, you may be sure that the dog will stay with the\r\nchildren. Allah! It is better that he came now, for otherwise he would\r\nlead the pursuing party on our tracks as far as Berber. You do not need\r\nto feed him, for if our leavings are not sufficient it will not be\r\ndifficult for him to get a hyena or jackal. Leave him in peace, I tell\r\nyou, and do not lose any time in idle talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" said Idris.\r\n\r\n\"If I am right, then I will give him water, so that he shall not run to\r\nthe Nile and show himself in the villages.\"\r\n\r\nIn this manner was decided the fate of Saba who, having somewhat rested\r\nhimself and eaten his fill, in the twinkling of an eye lapped up a bowl\r\nof water and started with renewed strength after the caravan.\r\n\r\nThey now rode on high, level ground, on which the wind wrinkled the\r\nsand and from which could be seen on both sides the immense expanse of\r\nthe desert. Heaven assumed the tint of a pearl shell. Light little\r\nclouds gathered in the east and changed like opals, after which they\r\nsuddenly became dyed with gold. One ray darted, afterwards another, and\r\nthe sun--as is usual in southern countries, in which there are scarcely\r\nany twilight and dawn--did not ascend, but burst from behind the clouds\r\nlike a pillar of fire and flooded the horizon with a bright light. It\r\nenlivened heaven, it enlivened the earth, and the immeasurable sandy\r\nexpanse was unveiled to the eyes of men.\r\n\r\n\"We must hasten,\" said Idris, \"for here we can be seen from a distance.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly the rested and satiated camels sped on with the celerity of\r\ngazelles. Saba remained behind, but there was no fear that he would get\r\nlost and not appear at the first short halt for refreshments. The\r\ndromedary on which Idris rode with Stas ran close to the one on which\r\nNell was mounted, so that the children could easily converse with each\r\nother. The seat which the Sudânese had made appeared splendid and the\r\nlittle girl really looked like a bird in a nest. She could not fall,\r\neven sleeping, and the ride fatigued her far less than during the\r\nnight. The bright daylight gave courage to both children. In Stas'\r\nheart the hope entered that since Saba had overtaken them, the pursuers\r\nmight do the same. This hope he at once shared with Nell, who smiled at\r\nhim for the first time since their abduction.\r\n\r\n\"When will they overtake us?\" she asked in French in order that Idris\r\nshould not understand them.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. It may be to-day; perhaps to-morrow; perhaps after two\r\nor three days.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we will not ride back on camels?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We will ride only as far as the Nile, and afterwards go by way of\r\nthe Nile to El-Wasta.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is good! oh, good!\"\r\n\r\nPoor Nell, who had previously loved these rides, had evidently now had\r\nenough of them.\r\n\r\n\"By way of the Nile--to El-Wasta and to papa!\" she began to repeat in a\r\nsleepy voice.\r\n\r\nAs at the previous stop she did not enjoy a full sound sleep, she now\r\nfell into that deep sleep which after fatigue comes towards morning. In\r\nthe meantime the Bedouins drove the camels without a rest and Stas\r\nobserved that they were making their way towards the interior of the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nSo, desiring to shake Idris' confidence that he would be able to elude\r\nthe pursuit, and at the same time to show him that he himself relied\r\nupon it as a dead certainty, he said:\r\n\r\n\"You are driving away from the Nile and from Bahr Yûsuf, but that won't\r\nhelp you, for of course they will not seek you on the banks where\r\nvillages lie side by side, but in the interior of the desert.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Idris asked:\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that we are driving away from the Nile, since the\r\nbanks cannot be seen from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the sun, which is in the eastern part of heaven, is warming\r\nour backs; that means we have turned to the west.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a wise boy,\" said Idris with esteem.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he added:\r\n\r\n\"But the pursuing party will not overtake us nor will you escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Stas, \"I shall not escape--unless with her.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed to the sleeping girl.\r\n\r\nUntil noon they sped almost without pausing for breath, but when the\r\nsun rose high in the sky and began to scorch, the camels, which by\r\nnature perspire but little, were covered with sweat, and their pace\r\nslackened considerably. The caravan again was surrounded by rocks and\r\ndunes. The ravines, which during the rainy season are changed into\r\nchannels of streams, or so-called \"khors,\" came to view more and more\r\nfrequently. The Bedouins finally halted in one of them which was\r\nentirely concealed amid the rocks. But they had barely dismounted from\r\nthe camels when they raised a cry and dashed ahead, bending over every\r\nlittle while and throwing stones ahead of them. Stas, who had not yet\r\nalighted from the saddle, beheld a strange sight. From among the dry\r\nbushes overgrowing the bed of the \"khor,\" a big snake emerged and,\r\ngliding sinuously with the rapidity of lightning among the fragments of\r\nrocks, escaped to some hiding-place known to itself. The Bedouins\r\nchased it furiously and Gebhr rushed to their aid with a knife. But\r\nowing to the unevenness of the ground it was difficult either to hit\r\nthe snake with a stone or to pin it with a knife. Soon all three\r\nreturned with terror visible on their faces.\r\n\r\nAnd the cries, customary with Arabs, resounded:\r\n\r\n\"Allah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bismillah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mashallah!\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards both Sudânese began to look with a kind of strange and, at\r\nthe same time, searching and inquiring gaze at Stas who could not\r\nunderstand what was the matter.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Nell also dismounted from her camel, and though she was\r\nless tired than during the night, Stas spread for her a saddle-cloth in\r\nthe shade on a level spot and told her to lie down, in order, as he\r\nsaid, that she might straighten out her little feet. The Arabs prepared\r\ntheir noon meal, which consisted of biscuits and dates, together with a\r\ngulp of water. The camels were not watered for they had drank during\r\nthe night. The faces of Idris, Gebhr and the Bedouins were still\r\ndejected, and the stop was made in silence. Finally Idris called Stas\r\naside, and began to question him with a countenance at once mysterious\r\nand perturbed.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see the snake?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you conjure it to appear before us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some ill-luck awaits us as those fools did not succeed in killing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gallows awaits you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent! Is your father a sorcerer?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is,\" answered Stas without any hesitation, for he understood in a\r\nmoment that those savage and superstitious men regarded the appearance\r\nof a reptile as an evil omen and an announcement that the flight would\r\nnot succeed.\r\n\r\n\"So then your father sent it to us,\" answered Idris, \"but he ought to\r\nunderstand that we can avenge ourselves for his charms upon you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not do anything to me as the sons of Fatma would have to\r\nsuffer for any injury to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you already understand this? But remember that if it was not for\r\nme, your blood would have flowed under Gebhr's courbash--yours and that\r\nlittle 'bint's' also.\"\r\n\r\n\"I therefore shall intercede for you only; but Gebhr shall swing on the\r\nrope.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Idris gazed at him for a while as if with astonishment and said:\r\n\r\n\"Our lives are not yet in your hands and you already talk to us as our\r\nlord--\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while he added:\r\n\r\n\"You are a strange 'uled' (boy), and such a one I have not yet seen.\r\nThus far I have been kind to you, but take heed and do not threaten.\"\r\n\r\n\"God punishes treachery,\" answered Stas.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent, however, that the assurance with which the boy spoke\r\nin connection with the evil omen in the form of a snake which succeeded\r\nin escaping, disquieted Idris in a high degree. Having already mounted\r\nthe camel he repeated several times: \"Yes, I was kind to you,\" as if in\r\nany event he wished to impress this upon Stas' memory, and afterwards\r\nhe began to finger the beads of a rosary made of the shells of \"dum\"\r\nnuts, and pray.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock, though it was in the winter season, the heat became\r\nunusual. In the sky there was not a cloudlet, but the horizon's border\r\nwas disfigured.\r\n\r\nAbove the caravan hovered a few vultures whose widely outstretched\r\nwings cast moving, black shadows on the tawny sands. In the heated air\r\ncould be smelt an odor like the gas exhaled from burning charcoal. The\r\ncamels, not ceasing to run, began to grunt strangely. One of the\r\nBedouins approached Idris.\r\n\r\n\"Some evil is brewing?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, do you think?\" asked the Sudânese.\r\n\r\n\"Wicked spirits awoke the wind slumbering on the western desert, and he\r\nrose from the sands and is rushing upon us.\"\r\n\r\nIdris raised himself on the saddle, gazed into the distance, and\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"That is so. He is coming from the west and south but is not as furious\r\nas a Khamsin.\"* [* A southwest wind which blows in the spring.]\r\n\r\n\"Three years ago near Abu-Hamed he buried a whole caravan and did not\r\nsweep the sand away until last winter. Ualla! He may have enough\r\nstrength to stuff the nostrils of the camels and dry up the water in\r\nthe bags.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary that we speed so that he strike us only with a wing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are flying in his eyes and are not able to avoid him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The quicker he comes, the quicker he will pass away.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, Idris struck his camel with a courbash and his example was\r\nfollowed by the others. For some time could be heard the dull blows of\r\nthe thick whips, resembling the clapping of hands, and the cries of\r\n\"Yalla.\" On the southwest the horizon, previously whitish, darkened.\r\nThe heat continued and the sun scorched the heads of the riders. The\r\nvultures soared very high evidently, for their shadows grew smaller and\r\nsmaller, and they finally vanished entirely.\r\n\r\nIt became sultry.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs yelled at the camels until their throats became parched,\r\nafter which they were silent and a funereal quiet ensued, interrupted\r\nonly by the groaning of the animals.\r\n\r\nTwo very small foxes* [* An animal smaller than our foxes, called\r\n\"fennec.\"] with big ears stole by the caravan, running in an opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe same Bedouin, who had previously conversed with Idris, spoke out\r\nagain in a strange and as if not his own voice:\r\n\r\n\"This will not be a usual wind. Evil charms are pursuing us. The snake\r\nis to blame for all--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" answered Idris.\r\n\r\n\"Look! the air quivers. That does not happen in winter.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact the heated air began to quiver, and in consequence of an\r\nillusion of the eyes it seemed to the riders that the sands quivered.\r\nThe Bedouin took his sweaty cowl from his head and said:\r\n\r\n\"The heart of the desert beats with terror.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at this the other Bedouin, riding in the lead as a guide of the\r\ncamels, turned around and began to shout:\r\n\r\n\"He is already coming!--He is coming!\"\r\n\r\nAnd in truth the wind came up. In the distance appeared as it were dark\r\nclouds which in their eyes grew higher and higher and approached the\r\ncaravan. The nearest waves of air all around became agitated and sudden\r\ngusts of wind began to spin the sand. Here and there funnels were\r\nformed as if someone had drilled the surface of the desert with a cane.\r\nAt places rose swift whirlpools resembling pillars, thin at the bottom\r\nand outspread on top like plumes of feathers. All this lasted but the\r\ntwinkling of an eye. The cloud which the camel-guide first espied came\r\nflying towards them with an inconceivable velocity. It struck the\r\npeople and beasts like the wing of a gigantic bird. In one moment the\r\neyes and mouths of the riders were filled with sand. Clouds of dust hid\r\nthe sky, hid the sun, and the earth became dusky. The men began to lose\r\nsight of one another and even the nearest camel appeared indistinctly\r\nas if in a fog. Not the rustle--for on the desert there are no\r\ntrees--but the roar of the whirlwind drowned the calls of the guide and\r\nthe bellowing of the animals. In the atmosphere could be smelt an odor\r\nsuch as coal smoke gives. The camels stood still and, turning away from\r\nthe wind, they stretched their long necks downward so that their\r\nnostrils almost touched the sand.\r\n\r\nThe Sudânese, however, did not wish to allow a stop, as caravans which\r\nhalt during a hurricane are often buried in sand. At such times it is\r\nbest to speed with the whirlwind, but Idris and Gebhr could not do\r\nthis, for in thus doing they would return to Fayûm from where they\r\nexpected a pursuit. So when the first gale passed they again drove the\r\ncamels.\r\n\r\nA momentary stillness ensued but the ruddy dusk dissipated very slowly\r\nfor the sun could not pierce through the clouds of dust suspended in\r\nthe air. The thicker and heavier particles of sand began to fall. Sand\r\nfilled all the cracks and punctures in the saddles and clung to the\r\nfolds of the clothes. The people with each breath inhaled dust which\r\nirritated their lungs and grated their teeth.\r\n\r\nBesides, the whirlwind might break out again and hide the whole world.\r\nIt occurred to Stas that if at the time of such darkness he was with\r\nNell on the same camel, he might turn around and escape with the wind\r\nnorthward. Who knows whether they would be observed amidst the dusk and\r\nconfusion of the elements, and, if they succeeded in reaching any\r\nvillage on Bahr Yûsuf near the Nile, Idris and Gebhr would not dare to\r\npursue them for they would at once fall into the hands of the local\r\n\"police.\"\r\n\r\nStas, weighing all this, jostled Idris' shoulder and said:\r\n\r\n\"Give me the gourd with water.\"\r\n\r\nIdris did not refuse for howsoever much that morning they had turned\r\ninto the interior of the desert and quite far from the river, they had\r\nenough of water, and the camels drank copiously during the time of\r\ntheir night stop. Besides this, as a man acquainted with the desert, he\r\nknew that after a hurricane, rain usually follows and the dried-up\r\n\"khors\" change temporarily into streams.\r\n\r\nStas in reality was thirsty, so he took a good drink, after which, not\r\nreturning the gourd, he again jostled Idris' arm.\r\n\r\n\"Halt the caravan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked the Sudânese.\r\n\r\n\"Because I want to sit on the camel with the little 'bint' and give her\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinah has a bigger gourd than mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she is greedy and surely has emptied it. A great deal of sand must\r\nhave fallen into her saddle which you made like a basket. Dinah will be\r\nhelpless.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wind will break out after a while and will refill it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the more reason why she will require help.\"\r\n\r\nIdris lashed the camel with his whip and for a while they rode in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you answer?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because I am considering whether it would be better to tie you to the\r\nsaddle or tie your hands behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have become insane.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I have guessed what you intended to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pursuers will overtake us anyway; so I would not have to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The desert is in the hands of God.\"\r\n\r\nThey became silent again. The thicker sand fell entirely; there\r\nremained in the air a subtile red dust, something of the nature of\r\npollen, through which the sun shone like a copper plate. But already\r\nthey could see ahead. Before the caravan stretched level ground at the\r\nborders of which the keen eyes of the Arabs again espied a cloud. It\r\nwas higher than the previous one and, besides this, there shot from it\r\nwhat seemed like pillars, or gigantic chimneys expanding at the top. At\r\nthis sight the hearts of the Arabs and Bedouins quailed for they\r\nrecognized the great sandy whirlpools. Idris raised his hands and\r\ndrawing his palms towards his ears began to prostrate himself to the\r\napproaching whirlwind. His faith in one God evidently did not prevent\r\nhis worship and fear of others for Stas distinctly heard him say:\r\n\r\n\"Lord! We are thy children; therefore do not devour us.\"\r\n\r\nBut the \"lord\" just dashed at them and assailed the camels with a force\r\nso terrible that they almost fell to the ground. The animals now formed\r\na compact pack with heads turned to the center towards each other.\r\nWhole masses of sand were stirred. The caravan was enveloped by a dusk\r\ndeeper than before and in that dusk there flew beside the riders dark\r\nand indistinct objects, as though gigantic birds or camels were\r\ndispersed with the hurricane. Fear seized the Arabs, to whom it seemed\r\nthat these were the spirits of animals and men who had perished under\r\nthe sands. Amid the roar and howling could be heard strange voices\r\nsimilar to sobs, to laughter, to cries for help. But these were\r\ndelusions. The caravan was threatened by real danger, a hundredfold\r\ngreater. The Sudânese well knew that if any one of the great\r\nwhirlpools, forming incessantly in the bosom of the hurricane, should\r\ncatch them in its whirls, it would hurl the riders to the ground and\r\ndisperse the camels, and if it should break and fall upon them then in\r\nthe twinkling of an eye an immense sandy mound would cover them in\r\nwhich they would remain until the next hurricane, blowing away the\r\nsand, should reveal their skeletons.\r\n\r\nStas' head swam, his lungs seemed choked, and the sand blinded him. But\r\nat times it seemed to him that he heard Nell crying and calling; so he\r\nthought only of her. Taking advantage of the fact that the camels stood\r\nin a close pack and that Idris might not observe him, he determined to\r\ncreep over quietly to the girl's camel, not for the purpose of\r\nescaping, but to give her assistance and encouragement. But he had\r\nbarely extended his limbs from under him and stretched out his hands to\r\ngrasp the edge of Nell's saddle, when the giant hand of Idris grabbed\r\nhim. The Sudânese snatched him like a feather, laid him before him and\r\nbegan to tie him with a palm rope, and after binding his hands, placed\r\nhim across the saddle. Stas pressed his teeth and resisted as well as\r\nhe could, but in vain. Having a parched throat and a mouth filled with\r\nsand he could not convince Idris that he desired only to go to the\r\ngirl's assistance and did not want to escape.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, however, feeling that he was suffocating, he began to\r\nshout in a stifled voice:\r\n\r\n\"Save the little 'bint'! Save the little 'bint'!\"\r\n\r\nBut the Arabs preferred to think of their own lives. The blasts became\r\nso terrible that they could not sit on the camels nor could the camels\r\nstand in their places. The two Bedouins with Chamis and Gebhr leaped to\r\nthe ground, in order to hold the animals by cords attached to the\r\nmouthpieces under their lower jaws. Idris, shoving Stas to the rear of\r\nthe saddle, did the same. The animals spread out their legs as widely\r\nas possible in order to resist the furious whirlwind, but they lacked\r\nstrength, and the caravan, scourged by gravel which cut like hundreds\r\nof whips and the sand which pricked like pins, began now slowly, then\r\nhurriedly, to turn about and retreat under the pressure. At times the\r\nwhirlwind tore holes under their feet, then again the sand and gravel\r\nbounding from the sides of the camels would form, in the twinkling of\r\nan eye, mounds reaching to their knees and higher. In this manner hour\r\npassed after hour. The danger became more and more terrible. Idris\r\nfinally understood that the only salvation was to remount the camels\r\nand fly with the whirlwind. But this would be returning in the\r\ndirection of Fayûm, where Egyptian Courts and the gallows were waiting\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! it cannot be helped,\" thought Idris. \"The hurricane will also stop\r\nthe pursuit and when it ceases, we will again proceed southward.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to shout that they should resume their seats on the camels.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment something happened which entirely changed the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the dusky, almost black, clouds of sand were illumined with a\r\nlivid light. The darkness then became still deeper, but at the same\r\ntime there arose, slumbering on high and awakened by the whirlwind,\r\nthunder; it began to roll between the Arabian and Libyan\r\ndeserts,--powerful, threatening, one might say, angry. It seemed as if\r\nfrom the heavens, mountains and rocks were tumbling down. The deafening\r\npeal intensified, grew, shook the world, began to roam all over the\r\nwhole horizon; in places it burst with a force as terrible as if the\r\nshattered vault of heaven had fallen upon earth and afterwards it again\r\nrolled with a hollow, continual rumble; again it burst forth, again\r\nbroke, it blinded with lightning, and struck with thunderbolts,\r\ndescended, rose, and pealed continuously.* [* The author heard in the\r\nvicinity of Aden thunder which lasted without intermission for half an\r\nhour. See \"Letters from Africa.\"]\r\n\r\nThe wind subsided as if overawed, and when after a long time somewhere\r\nin the immeasurable distance the chain-bolt of heaven rattled, a deadly\r\nstillness followed the thunder.\r\n\r\nBut after a while in that silence the voice of the guide resounded.\r\n   \"God is above the whirlwind and the storm. We are saved.\"\r\n\r\nThey started. But they were enveloped by a night so impenetrable that\r\nthough the camels ran close together, the men could not see each other\r\nand had to shout aloud every little while in order not to lose one\r\nanother. From time to time glaring lightning, livid or red, illuminated\r\nthe sandy expanse, but afterwards fell a darkness so thick as to be\r\nalmost palpable. Notwithstanding the hope, which the voice of the guide\r\npoured into the hearts of the Sudânese, uneasiness did not yet leave\r\nthem, because they moved blindly, not knowing in truth in which\r\ndirection they were going;--whether they were moving around in a circle\r\nor were returning northward. The animals stumbled against each other\r\nevery little while and could not run swiftly, and besides they panted\r\nstrangely, and so loudly that it seemed to the riders that the whole\r\ndesert panted from fear. Finally fell the first drops of rain, which\r\nalmost always follows a hurricane, and at the same time the voice of\r\nthe guide broke out amidst the darkness:\r\n\r\n\"Khor!\"\r\n\r\nThey were above a ravine. The camels paused at the brink; after which\r\nthey began to step carefully towards the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe khor was wide, covered on the bottom with stones among which grew\r\ndwarfish, thorny shrubs. A high rock full of crevices and fissures\r\nformed its southern wall. The Arabs discerned all this by the light of\r\nquiet but more and more frequent lightning flashes. Soon they also\r\ndiscovered in the rocky wall a kind of shallow cave or, rather, a broad\r\nniche, in which people could easily be harbored and, in case of a great\r\ndownpour, could find shelter. The camels also could be comfortably\r\nlodged upon a slight elevation close by the niche. The Bedouins and two\r\nSudânese removed from them their burdens and saddles, so that they\r\nmight rest well, and Chamis, son of Chadigi, occupied himself in the\r\nmeantime with pulling thorny shrubs for a fire. Big single drops fell\r\ncontinually but the downpour began only when the party lay down to\r\nsleep. At first it was like strings of water, afterwards ropes, and in\r\nthe end it seemed as if whole rivers were flowing from invisible\r\nclouds. Such rains, which occur only once in several years, swell, even\r\nin winter time, the water of the canals and the Nile, and in Aden fill\r\nimmense cisterns, without which the city could not exist at all. Stas\r\nnever in his life had seen anything like it. At the bottom of the khor\r\nthe stream began to rumble; the entrance to the niche was veiled as if\r\nby a curtain of water; around could be heard only splashing and\r\nspluttering.\r\n\r\nThe camels stood on an elevation and the downpour at most would give\r\nthem a bath; nevertheless the Arabs peered out every little while to\r\nsee if any danger threatened the animals. To the others it was\r\nagreeable to sit in the cave, safe from danger, by the bright fire of\r\nbrushwood, which was not yet soaked. On their faces joy was depicted.\r\nIdris, who immediately after their arrival had untied Stas' hands so\r\nthat he could eat, now turned to him and smiling contemptuously said:\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi is greater than all white sorcerers. He subdued the\r\nhurricane and sent rain.\"\r\n\r\nStas did not reply for he was occupied with Nell, who was barely alive.\r\nFirst he shook the sand from her hair, afterwards directed old Dinah to\r\nunpack the things which she, in the belief that the children were going\r\nto their parents, brought with her from Fayûm. He took a towel, wet it,\r\nand wiped the little girl's eyes and face with it. Dinah could not do\r\nthis as seeing but poorly with one eye only, she lost her sight almost\r\nentirely during the hurricane and washing her heated eyelids did not\r\nbring her any relief. Nell submitted passively to all of Stas' efforts;\r\nshe only gazed at him like an exhausted bird, and only when he removed\r\nher shoes to spill out the sand and afterwards when he smoothed out the\r\nsaddle-cloths did she throw her arms around his neck.\r\n\r\nHis heart overflowed with great pity. He felt that he was a guardian,\r\nan older brother, and at that time Nell's only protector, and he felt\r\nat the same time that he loved this little sister immensely, far more\r\nthan ever before. He loved her indeed in Port Said, but he regarded her\r\nas a \"baby\"; so, for instance, it never even occurred to him to kiss\r\nher hand in bidding her good night. If any one had suggested such an\r\nidea to him he would have thought that a bachelor, who had finished his\r\nthirteenth year, could not without derogation to his dignity and age do\r\nanything like that. But, at present, a common distress awoke in him\r\ndormant tenderness; so he kissed not one but both hands of the little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nLying down, he continued to think of her and determined to perform some\r\nextraordinary deed to snatch her from captivity. He was prepared for\r\neverything, even for wounds and death; only with this little\r\nreservation secreted in his heart, that the wounds should not be too\r\npainful, and that the death should not be an inevitable and real death,\r\nas in such case he could not witness the happiness of Nell when\r\nliberated. Afterwards he began to ponder upon the most heroic manner of\r\nsaving her, but his thoughts became confused. For a while it seemed to\r\nhim that whole clouds of sand were burying him; afterwards that all the\r\ncamels were piling on his head,--and he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs, exhausted by the battle with the hurricane, after attending\r\nto the camels, also fell into a sound sleep. The fire became extinct\r\nand a dusk prevailed in the niche. Soon the snores of the men\r\nresounded, and from outside came the splash of the downpour and the\r\nroar of the waters clashing over the stones on the bottom of the khor.\r\nIn this manner the night passed.\r\n\r\nBut before dawn Stas was awakened from a heavy sleep by a feeling of\r\ncold. It appeared that water which accumulated in the fissures on the\r\ntop of the rock slowly passed through some cleft in the vault of the\r\ncave and began finally to trickle onto his head. The boy sat up on the\r\nsaddle-cloth and for some time struggled with sleep; he did not realize\r\nwhere he was and what had happened to him.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, however, consciousness returned to him.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" he thought, \"yesterday there was a hurricane and we are\r\nkidnapped, and this is a cave in which we sought shelter from the rain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to gaze around. At first he observed with astonishment\r\nthat the rain had passed away and that it was not at all dark in the\r\ncave, as it was illuminated by the moon which was about to set. In its\r\npale beams could be seen the whole interior of that wide but shallow\r\nniche. Stas saw distinctly the Arabs lying beside each other, and under\r\nthe other wall of the cave the white dress of Nell who was sleeping\r\nclose to Dinah.\r\n\r\nAnd again great tenderness possessed his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep, Nell--sleep,\" he said to himself; \"but I do not sleep, and must\r\nsave her.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, glancing at the Arabs, he added in his soul:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I do want to have all these rogues--\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he trembled.\r\n\r\nHis gaze fell upon the leather case containing the short rifle\r\npresented to him as a Christmas gift, and the cartridge boxes lying\r\nbetween him and Chamis, so near that it would suffice for him to\r\nstretch out his hand.\r\n\r\nAnd his heart began to beat like a hammer. If he could secure the rifle\r\nand boxes he would certainly be the master of the situation. It would\r\nbe enough in that case to slip noiselessly out of the niche, hide about\r\nfifty paces away, among the rocks, and from there watch the exit of the\r\nSudânese and Bedouins. He thought that if they awakened and observed\r\nhis absence they would rush out of the cave together but at that time\r\nhe could with two bullets shoot down the first two and, before the\r\nothers could reach him, the rifle could be reloaded. Chamis would\r\nremain but he could take care of him.\r\n\r\nHere he pictured to himself four corpses lying in a pool of blood, and\r\nfright and horror seized his breast. To kill four men! Indeed they were\r\nknaves, but even so it was a horrifying affair. He recollected that at\r\none time he saw a laborer--a fellah--killed by the crank of a steam\r\ndredge, and what a horrible impression his mortal remains, quivering in\r\na red puddle, made upon him! He shuddered at the recollection. And now\r\nfour would be necessary! four! The sin and the horror! No, no, he was\r\nincapable of that.\r\n\r\nHe began to struggle with his thoughts. For himself, he would not do\r\nthat--No! But Nell was concerned; her protection, her salvation, and\r\nher life were involved, for she could not endure all this, and\r\ncertainly would die either on the road or among the wild and brutalized\r\nhordes of dervishes. What meant the blood of such wretches beside the\r\nlife of Nell, and could any one in such a situation hesitate?\r\n\r\n\"For Nell! For Nell!\"\r\n\r\nBut suddenly a thought flew like a whirlwind through Stas' mind and\r\ncaused the hair to rise on his head. What would happen if any one of\r\nthe outlaws placed a knife at Nell's breast, and announced that he\r\nwould murder her if he--Stas--did not surrender and return the rifle to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" answered the boy to himself, \"I should surrender at once.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a realization of his helplessness he again flung himself\r\nimpotently upon the saddle-cloth.\r\n\r\nThe moon now peered obliquely through the opening of the cave and it\r\nbecame less dark. The Arabs snored continually. Some time passed and a\r\nnew idea began to dawn in Stas' head.\r\n\r\nIf, slipping out with the weapon and hiding among the rocks, he should\r\nkill not the men but shoot the camels? It would be too bad and a sad\r\nending for the innocent animals;--that is true, but what was to be\r\ndone? Why, people kill animals not only to save life but for broth and\r\nroast meat. Now it was a certainty that if he succeeded in killing\r\nfour, and better still five camels, further travel would be impossible.\r\nNo one in the caravan would dare to go to the villages near the banks\r\nto purchase new camels. And in such a case Stas, in the name of his\r\nfather, would promise the men immunity from punishment and even a\r\npecuniary reward and--nothing else would remain to do but to return.\r\n\r\nYes, but if they should not give him time to make such a promise and\r\nshould kill him in the first transports of rage?\r\n\r\nThey must give him time and hear him for he would hold the rifle in his\r\nhand; he would be able to hold them at bay until he stated everything.\r\nWhen he had done, they would understand that their only salvation would\r\nbe to surrender. Then he would be in command of the caravan and lead it\r\ndirectly to Bahr Yûsuf and the Nile. To be sure, at present they are\r\nquite a distance from it, perhaps one or two days' journey, as the\r\nArabs through caution had turned considerably into the interior of the\r\ndesert. But that did not matter; there would remain, of course, a few\r\ncamels and on one of them Nell would ride.\r\n\r\nStas began to gaze attentively at the Arabs. They slept soundly, as\r\npeople exceedingly tired do, but as the night was waning, they might\r\nsoon awaken. It was necessary to act at once. The taking of the\r\ncartridge boxes did not present any difficulties as they lay close by.\r\nA more difficult matter was to get the rifle, which Chamis had placed\r\nat his further side. Stas hoped that he would succeed in purloining it,\r\nbut he decided to draw it out of the case and put the stock and the\r\nbarrels together when he should be about fifty paces from the cave, as\r\nhe feared that the clank of the iron against iron would wake the\r\nsleepers.\r\n\r\nThe moment arrived. The boy bent like an arch over Chamis and, seizing\r\nthe case by the handle, began to transfer it to his side. His heart and\r\npulse beat heavily, his eyes grew dim, his breathing became rapid, but\r\nhe shut his teeth and tried to control his emotions. Nevertheless when\r\nthe straps of the case creaked lightly, drops of cold perspiration\r\nstood on his forehead. That second seemed to him an age. But Chamis did\r\nnot even stir. The case described an arch over him and rested silently\r\nbeside the box with cartridges.\r\n\r\nStas breathed freely. One-half of the work was done. Now it was\r\nnecessary to slip out of the cave noiselessly and run about fifty\r\npaces; afterwards to hide in a fissure, open the case, put the rifle\r\ntogether, load it, and fill his pockets with cartridges. The caravan\r\nthen would be actually at his mercy.\r\n\r\nStas' black silhouette was outlined on the brighter background of the\r\ncave's entrance. A second more and he would be on the outside, and\r\nwould hide in the rocky fissure. And then, even though one of the\r\noutlaws should wake, before he realized what had happened and before he\r\naroused the others it would be too late. The boy, from fear of knocking\r\ndown some stone, of which a large number lay at the threshold of the\r\nniche, shoved out one foot and began to seek firm ground with his step.\r\n\r\nAnd already his head leaned out of the opening and he was about to slip\r\nout wholly when suddenly something happened which turned the blood in\r\nhis veins to ice.\r\n\r\nAmid the profound stillness pealed like a thunderbolt the joyous bark\r\nof Saba; it filled the whole ravine and awoke the echoes reposing in\r\nit. The Arabs as one man were startled from their sleep, and the first\r\nobject which struck their eyes was the sight of Stas with the case in\r\none hand and the cartridge box in the other.\r\n\r\nAh, Saba! what have you done?\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nWith cries of horror, all in a moment rushed at Stas; in the twinkling\r\nof an eye they wrested the rifle and cartridges from him and threw him\r\non the ground, tied his hands and feet, striking and kicking him all\r\nthe time, until finally Idris, from fear of the boy's life, drove them\r\noff. Afterwards they began to converse in disjointed words, as people\r\ndo over whom had impended a terrible danger and whom only an accident\r\nhad saved.\r\n\r\n\"That is Satan incarnate,\" exclaimed Idris, with face pallid with\r\nfright and emotion.\r\n\r\n\"He would have shot us like wild geese for food,\" added Gebhr.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, if it was not for that dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"God sent him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you wanted to kill him?\" said Chamis.\r\n\r\n\"From this time no one shall touch him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall always have bones and water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allah! Allah!\" repeated Idris, not being able to compose himself.\r\n\"Death was upon us. Ugh!\"\r\n\r\nAnd they began to stare at Stas lying there, with hatred but with a\r\ncertain wonder that one small boy might have been the cause of their\r\ncalamity and destruction.\r\n\r\n\"By the prophet!\" spoke out one of the Bedouins, \"it is necessary to\r\nprevent this son of Iblis from twisting our necks. We are taking a\r\nviper to the Mahdi. What do you intend to do with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must cut off his right hand!\" exclaimed Gebhr.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouins did not answer, but Idris would not consent to this\r\nproposition. It occurred to him that if the pursuers should capture\r\nthem, a more terrible punishment would be meted to them for the\r\nmutilation of the boy. Finally, who could guarantee that Stas would not\r\ndie after such an operation? In such a case for the exchange of Fatma\r\nand her children only Nell would remain. So when Gebhr pulled out his\r\nknife with the intention of executing his threat, Idris seized him by\r\nthe wrist and held it.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he said. \"It would be a disgrace for five of the Mahdi's warriors\r\nto fear one Christian whelp so much as to cut off his fist; we will\r\nbind him for the night, and for that which he wanted to do, he shall\r\nreceive ten lashes of the courbash.\"\r\n\r\nGebhr was ready to execute the sentence at once but Idris again pushed\r\nhim away and ordered the flogging to be done by one of the Bedouins, to\r\nwhom he whispered not to hit very hard. As Chamis, perhaps out of\r\nregard for his former service with the engineers or perhaps from some\r\nother reason, did not want to mix in the matter, the other Bedouin\r\nturned Stas over with his back up and the punishment was about to take\r\nplace, when at that moment an unexpected obstacle came.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the niche Nell appeared with Saba.\r\n\r\nOccupied with her pet, who, dashing into the cave, threw himself at\r\nonce at her little feet, she had heard the shouts of the Arabs, but, as\r\nin Egypt Arabs as well as Bedouins yell on every occasion as if they\r\nare about to annihilate each other, she did not pay any attention to\r\nthem. Not until she called Stas and received no reply from him, did she\r\ngo out to see whether he was not already seated on the camels. With\r\nterror she saw in the first luster of the morning Stas lying on the\r\nground and above him a Bedouin with a courbash in his hand. At the\r\nsight of this she screamed with all her strength and stamped with her\r\nlittle feet, and when the Bedouin, not paying any attention to this,\r\naimed the first blow, she flung herself forward and covered the boy\r\nwith her body.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin hesitated, as he did not have an order to strike the little\r\ngirl, and in the meantime her voice resounded full of despair and\r\nhorror:\r\n\r\n\"Saba! Saba!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Saba understood what was the matter and in one leap was in the\r\nniche. The hair bristled on his neck and back, his eyes flamed redly,\r\nin his breast and powerful throat there was a rumble as if of thunder.\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards, the lips of his wrinkled jaws rose slowly upward and\r\nthe teeth as well as the white fangs, an inch long, appeared as far as\r\nthe bloody gums. The giant mastiff now began to turn his head to the\r\nright and to the left as if he wanted to display well his terrible\r\nequipment to the Sudânese and Bedouins and tell them:\r\n\r\n\"Look! here is something with which I shall defend the children!\"\r\n\r\nThey, on the other hand, retreated hurriedly for they knew in the first\r\nplace that Saba had saved their lives and again that it was a clear\r\nthing that whoever approached Nell at that moment would have the fangs\r\nof the infuriated mastiff sunk at once in his throat. So they stood\r\nirresolute, staring with an uncertain gaze and as if asking one another\r\nwhat in the present situation had better be done.\r\n\r\nTheir hesitation continued so long that Nell had sufficient time to\r\nsummon old Dinah and order her to cut Stas' bonds. Then the boy,\r\nplacing his hand on Saba's head, turned to his assailants:\r\n\r\n\"I did not want to kill you--only the camels,\" he said through his set\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nBut this information so startled the Arabs that they undoubtedly would\r\nhave again rushed at Stas were it not for Saba's flaming eyes and\r\nbristling hair. Gebhr even started to dash towards him, but one hollow\r\ngrowl riveted him to the spot.\r\n\r\nA moment of silence followed, after which Idris' loud voice resounded:\r\n\r\n\"To the road! To the road!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nA day passed, a night, and yet another day and they drove constantly\r\nsouthward, halting only for a brief time in the khors in order not to\r\nfatigue the camels too much, to water and feed them, and also to divide\r\ntheir provisions and water. From fear of the pursuit they turned yet\r\nfarther to the west, for they did not have to concern themselves about\r\nwater for some time. The downpour had lasted indeed not more than seven\r\nhours, but it was as tremendous as if a cloud-burst had occurred on the\r\ndesert. Idris and Gebhr as well as the Bedouins knew that on the beds\r\nof the khors and in those places where the rocks formed natural\r\ncavities and wells they would, for a few days, find enough water to\r\nsuffice not only for their and the camels' immediate wants but even for\r\nreplenishing their supplies. After the great rain, as usual, splendid\r\nweather followed. The sky was cloudless, and the air so transparent\r\nthat the view reached over an immeasurable distance. At night the\r\nheaven, studded with stars, twinkled and sparkled as if with thousands\r\nof diamonds. From the desert sands came a refreshing coolness.\r\n\r\nThe camel-humps already grew smaller but the animals, being well-fed,\r\nwere, according to the Arabian expression, \"harde,\" that is, they were\r\nunimpaired in strength and ran so willingly that the caravan advanced\r\nbut little slower than on the first day after their departure from\r\nGharak el-Sultani. Stas with astonishment observed that in some of the\r\nkhors, in rocky fissures protected from rain, were supplies of durra\r\nand dates. He inferred from this that, before their abduction, certain\r\npreparations were made and everything was pre-arranged between Fatma,\r\nIdris, and Gebhr on one side and the Bedouins on the other. It was also\r\neasy to surmise that both the Bedouins were Mahdist adherents and\r\nbelievers, who wanted to join their leader, and for that reason were\r\neasily drawn into the plot by the Sudânese. In the neighborhood of\r\nFayûm and ground Gharak el-Sultani there were quite a number of\r\nBedouins who with their children and camels led a migratory life on the\r\ndesert and came to Medinet and the railway stations for gain.\r\n\r\nStas, however, had never seen these two before, and they also could not\r\nhave been in Medinet, for it appeared they did not know Saba.\r\n\r\nThe idea of attempting to bribe them occurred to the boy, but\r\nrecollecting their shouts, full of fervor, whenever the name of the\r\nMahdi was mentioned by them, he deemed this an impossibility.\r\nNevertheless, he did not submit passively to the events, for in that\r\nboyish soul there was imbedded a really astonishing energy, which was\r\ninflamed by the past failures.\r\n\r\n\"Everything which I have undertaken,\" he soliloquized, \"ended in my\r\ngetting a whipping. But even if they flog me with that courbash every\r\nday and even kill me, I will not stop thinking of rescuing Nell and\r\nmyself from the hands of these villains. If the pursuers capture them,\r\nso much the better. I, however, will act as if I did not expect them.\"\r\nAnd at the recollection of what he had met at the thought of those\r\ntreacherous and cruel people who, after snatching away the rifle, had\r\nbelabored him with fists and kicked him, his heart rebelled and rancor\r\ngrew. He felt not only vanquished but humiliated by them in his pride\r\nas a white man. Above all, however, he felt Nell's wrong and this\r\nfeeling, with the bitterness which intensified within him after the\r\nlast failure, changed into an inexorable hatred of both Sudânese. He\r\nhad often heard, indeed, from his father that hatred blinds, and that\r\nonly such souls yield to it as are incapable of anything better; but\r\nfor the time being he could not subdue it within him, and did not know\r\nhow to conceal it.\r\n\r\nHe did not know to what extent Idris had observed it and had begun to\r\nget uneasy, understanding that, in case the pursuing party should\r\ncapture them, he could not depend upon the boy's intercession. Idris\r\nwas always ready for the most audacious deed, but as a man not deprived\r\nof reason, he thought that it was necessary to provide for everything\r\nand in case of misfortune to leave some gate of salvation open. For\r\nthis reason, after the last occurrence he wanted in some manner to\r\nconciliate Stas and, with this object, at the first stop, he began the\r\nfollowing conversation with him.\r\n\r\n\"After what you wanted to do,\" he said, \"I had to punish you as\r\notherwise they would have killed you, but I ordered the Bedouin not to\r\nstrike you hard.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when he received no reply, he, after a while, continued thus:\r\n\r\n\"Listen! you yourself have said that the white people always keep their\r\noath. So if you will swear by your God and by the head of that little\r\n'bint' that you will do nothing against us, then I will not order you\r\nto be bound for the night.\"\r\n\r\nStas did not answer a single word to this and only from the glitter of\r\nhis eyes did Idris perceive that he spoke in vain.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, notwithstanding the urging of Gebhr and the Bedouins, he\r\ndid not order him to be bound for the night, and when Gebhr did not\r\ncease his importunities, he replied with anger:\r\n\r\n\"Instead of going to sleep, you will to-night stand on guard. I have\r\ndecided that from this time one of us shall watch during the sleep of\r\nthe others.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in reality a change of guards was introduced permanently from that\r\nday. This rendered more difficult and completely frustrated all plans\r\nof Stas to whom every sentinel paid watchful attention.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand the children were left in greater freedom so that\r\nthey could approach each other and converse without hindrance.\r\nImmediately after the first stop Stas sat close to Nell for he was\r\nanxious to thank her for her aid.\r\n\r\nBut though he felt great gratitude to her he did not know how to\r\nexpress himself, either in a lofty style or tenderly; so he merely\r\nbegan to shake both of her little hands.\r\n\r\n\"Nell!\" he said, \"you are very good and I thank you; and besides this I\r\nfrankly say that you acted like a person of at least thirteen years.\"\r\n\r\nOn Stas' lips words like these were the highest praise; so the heart of\r\nthe little woman was consumed with joy and pride. It seemed to her at\r\nthat moment that nothing was impossible. \"Wait till I grow up, then\r\nthey will see!\" she replied, throwing a belligerent glance in the\r\ndirection of the Sudânese.\r\n\r\nBut as she did not understand the cause of the trouble and why all the\r\nArabs rushed at Stas, the boy told her how he had determined to purloin\r\nthe rifle, kill the camels, and force all to return to the river.\r\n\r\n\"If I had succeeded,\" he said, \"we would now be free.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they awoke?\" asked the little girl with palpitating heart.\r\n\r\n\"They did. That was caused by Saba, who came running toward me, barking\r\nloud enough to awaken the dead.\"\r\n\r\nThen her indignation was directed against Saba.\r\n\r\n\"Nasty Saba! nasty! For this when he comes running up to me I won't\r\nspeak a word to him and will tell him that he is horrid.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Stas, though he was not in a laughing mood, laughed and asked:\r\n\r\n\"How will you be able not to say a word to him and at the same time\r\ntell him he is horrid?\"\r\n\r\nNell's eyebrows rose and her countenance reflected embarrassment, after\r\nwhich she said:\r\n\r\n\"He will know that from my looks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps. But he is not to blame, for he could not know what was\r\nhappening. Remember also that afterwards he came to our rescue.\"\r\n\r\nThis recollection placated Nell's anger a little. She did not, however,\r\nwant to grant pardon to the culprit at once.\r\n\r\n\"That is very well,\" she said, \"but a real gentleman ought not to bark\r\non greeting.\"\r\n\r\nStas burst out laughing again.\r\n\r\n\"Neither does a real gentleman bark on leave-taking unless he is a dog,\r\nand Saba is one.\"\r\n\r\nBut after a while sorrow dimmed the boy's eyes; he sighed once, then\r\nagain; after which he rose from the stone on which they sat and said:\r\n\r\n\"The worst is that I could not free you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Nell raised herself on her little toes and threw her arms around\r\nhis neck. She wanted to cheer him; she wanted, with her little nose\r\nclose to his face, to whisper her gratitude, but, as she could not find\r\nappropriate words, she only squeezed his neck yet more tightly and\r\nkissed his ear. In the meantime Saba, always late--not so much because\r\nhe was unable to keep pace with the camels, but because he hunted for\r\njackals on the way, or drove away vultures perched on the crests of\r\nrocks with his barking--came rushing up, making his customary noise.\r\nThe children at the sight of him forgot about everything, and\r\nnotwithstanding their hard situation began their usual caresses and\r\nplay until they were interrupted by the Arabs. Chamis gave the dog food\r\nand water, after which all mounted the camels and started with the\r\ngreatest speed southward.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was their longest journey, for they rode with small interruption for\r\neighteen hours. Only real saddle-camels, having a good supply of water\r\nin their stomachs, could endure such a drive. Idris did not spare them,\r\nfor he really feared the pursuit. He understood that it must have\r\nstarted long ago, and he assumed that both engineers would be at its\r\nhead and would not lose any time. Danger threatened from the direction\r\nof the river, for it was certain that immediately after the abduction\r\ntelegraphic orders were despatched to all settlements on the banks\r\ndirecting the sheiks to start expeditions into the interior of the\r\ndesert on both sides of the Nile, and to detain all parties riding\r\nsouthward. Chamis assured the others that the Government and engineers\r\nmust have offered a large reward for their capture and that in\r\nconsequence of this the desert was undoubtedly swarming with searching\r\nparties. The only course to pursue would be to turn as far as possible\r\nto the west; but on the west lay the great oasis of Kharga, to which\r\ndespatches also could reach, and besides, if they rode too far west\r\nthey would lack water after a few days, and death from thirst would\r\nawait them.\r\n\r\nAnd the question of food became a vital one. The Bedouins in the course\r\nof the two weeks preceding the abduction of the children had placed in\r\nhiding-places, supplies of durra, biscuits, and dates, but only for a\r\ndistance of four days' journey from Medinet. Idris, with fear, thought\r\nthat when provisions should be lacking it would be imperatively\r\nnecessary to send men to purchase supplies at the villages on the river\r\nbanks, and then these men, in view of the aroused vigilance and reward\r\noffered for the capture of the fugitives, might easily fall into the\r\nhands of the local sheiks,--and betray the whole caravan. The situation\r\nwas indeed difficult, almost desperate, and Idris each day perceived\r\nmore plainly upon what an insane undertaking he had ventured.\r\n\r\n\"If we could only pass Assuan! If we could only pass Assuan!\" he said\r\nto himself with alarm and despair in his soul. He did not indeed\r\nbelieve Chamis who claimed that the Mahdi's warriors had already\r\nreached Assuan, as Stas denied this.\r\n\r\nIdris long since perceived that the white \"uled\" knew more than all of\r\nthem. But he supposed that beyond the first cataract, where the people\r\nwere wilder and less susceptible to the influences of Englishmen and\r\nthe Egyptian Government, he would find more adherents of the prophet,\r\nwho in a case of emergency would give them succor, and would furnish\r\nfood and camels. But it was, as the Bedouins reckoned, about five days'\r\njourney to Assuan over a road which became more and more desolate, and\r\nevery stop visibly diminished their supplies for man and beast.\r\n\r\nFortunately they could urge the camels and drive with the greatest\r\nspeed, for the heat did not exhaust their strength. During daytime, at\r\nthe noon hour, the sun, indeed, scorched strongly but the air was\r\ncontinually invigorating and the nights so cool that Stas, with the\r\nconsent of Idris, changed his seat to Nell's camel, desiring to watch\r\nover her and protect her from catching cold.\r\n\r\nBut his fears were vain, as Dinah, whose eyes, or rather, eye, improved\r\nconsiderably, watched with great solicitude over her little lady. The\r\nboy was even surprised that the little one's health thus far did not\r\nsuffer any impairment and that she bore the journey, with\r\neverdecreasing stops, as well as himself. Grief, fear, and the tears\r\nwhich she shed from longing for her papa evidently did not harm her\r\nmuch. Perhaps her slightly emaciated and bright little countenance was\r\ntanned by the wind, but in the later days of the journey she felt far\r\nless fatigued than at the beginning. It is true that Idris gave her the\r\neasiest carrying camel and had made an excellent saddle so that she\r\ncould sleep in it lying down; nevertheless the desert air, which she\r\nbreathed day and night, mainly gave her strength to endure the\r\nhardships and irregular hours.\r\n\r\nStas not only watched over her but intentionally surrounded her with a\r\nworship which, notwithstanding his immense attachment to his little\r\nsister, he did not at all feel for her. He observed, however, that this\r\naffected the Arabs and that they involuntarily were fortified in the\r\nconviction that they were bearing something of unheard-of value, some\r\nexceptionally important female captive, with whom it was necessary to\r\nact with the greatest possible care. Idris had been accustomed to this\r\nwhile at Medinet; so now all treated her well. They did not spare water\r\nand dates for her. The cruel Gebhr would not now have dared to raise\r\nhis hand against her. Perhaps the extraordinarily fine stature of the\r\nlittle girl contributed to this, and also that there was in her\r\nsomething of the nature of a flower and of a bird, and this charm even\r\nthe savage and undeveloped souls of the Arabs could not resist. Often\r\nalso, when at a resting place she stood by the fire fed by the roses of\r\nJericho or thorns, rosy from the flame and silvery in the moonlight,\r\nthe Sudânese as well as the Bedouins could not tear their eyes from\r\nher, smacking their lips from admiration, according to their habit, and\r\nmurmuring:\r\n\r\n\"Allah! Mashallah! Bismillah!\"\r\n\r\nThe second day at noon after that long rest, Stas and Nell who rode\r\nthis time on the same camel, had a moment of joyful emotion.\r\nImmediately after sunrise a light and transparent mist rose over the\r\ndesert, but it soon fell. Afterwards when the sun ascended higher, the\r\nheat became greater than during the previous days. At moments when the\r\ncamels halted there could not be felt the slightest breeze, so that the\r\nair as well as the sands seemed to slumber in the warmth, in the light,\r\nand in the stillness. The caravan had just ridden upon a great\r\nmonotonous level ground, unbroken by khors, when suddenly a wonderful\r\nspectacle presented itself to the eyes of the children. Groups of\r\nslender palms and pepper trees, plantations of mandarins, white houses,\r\na small mosque with projecting minaret, and, lower, walls surrounding\r\ngardens, all these appeared with such distinctness and at distance so\r\nclose that one might assume that after the lapse of half an hour the\r\ncaravan would be amid the trees of the oasis.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" exclaimed Stas. \"Nell, Nell! Look!\"\r\n\r\nNell rose, and for a time was silent with astonishment, but after a\r\nwhile began to cry with joy:\r\n\r\n\"Medinet! to papa! to papa!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Stas turned pale from emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Truly--Perhaps that is Kharga--But no! That is Medinet perhaps--I\r\nrecognize the minaret and even see the windmills above the wells--\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, in the distance the highly elevated American windmills\r\nresembling great white stars, actually glistened. On the verdant\r\nbackground of the trees they could be seen so perfectly that Stas' keen\r\nsight could distinguish the borders of the vanes painted red.\r\n\r\n\"That is Medinet!--\"\r\n\r\nStas knew from books and narratives that there were on the desert\r\nphantasms known as \"fata morgana\" and that sometimes travelers happen\r\nto see oases, cities, tufts of trees and lakes, which are nothing more\r\nthan an illusion, a play of light, and a reflection of real distant\r\nobjects. But this time the phenomenon was so distinct, so well-nigh\r\npalpable that he could not doubt that he saw the real Medinet. There\r\nwas the turret upon the Mudir's house, there the circular balcony near\r\nthe summit of the minaret from which the muezzin called to prayers,\r\nthere that familiar group of trees, and particularly those windmills.\r\nNo,--that must be the reality. It occurred to the boy that the\r\nSudânese, reflecting upon their situation, had come to the conclusion\r\nthat they could not escape and, without saying anything to him, had\r\nturned back to Fayûm. But their calmness suggested to him the first\r\ndoubts. If that really was Fayûm, would they gaze upon it so\r\nindifferently? They, of course, saw the phenomenon and pointed it out\r\nto each other with their fingers, but on their faces could not be seen\r\nthe least perplexity or emotion. Stas gazed yet once more and perhaps\r\nthis indifference of the Arabs caused the picture to seem fainter to\r\nhim. He also thought that, if in truth they were returning, the caravan\r\nwould be grouped together, and the men, though only from fear, would\r\nride in a body. But, in the meanwhile, the Bedouins, who, by Idris'\r\norder, for the past few days drove considerably in advance, could not\r\nbe seen at all; while Chamis, riding as a rear guard, appeared at a\r\ndistance not greater than the vulture lying on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Fata Morgana,\" said Stas to himself.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Idris approached him and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Heigh! Speed your camel! You see Medinet!\"\r\n\r\nHe evidently spoke jokingly and there was so much spite in his voice\r\nthat the last hope that the real Medinet was before him vanished in the\r\nboy's heart.\r\n\r\nAnd with sorrow in his heart he turned to Nell to dispel her delusion,\r\nwhen unexpectedly an incident occurred which drew the attention of all\r\nin another direction.\r\n\r\nAt first a Bedouin appeared, running towards them at full speed and\r\nbrandishing from afar a long Arabian rifle which no one in the caravan\r\npossessed before that time. Reaching Idris, he exchanged a few hurried\r\nwords with him, after which the caravan turned precipitately into the\r\ninterior of the desert. But, after a time, the other Bedouin appeared\r\nleading by a rope a fat she-camel, with a saddle on its hump and\r\nleather bags hanging on its sides. A short conversation commenced, of\r\nwhich Stas could not catch a word. The caravan in full speed made for\r\nthe west. It halted only when they chanced upon a narrow khor full of\r\nrocks scattered in wild disorder, and of fissures and caverns. One of\r\nthese was so spacious that the Sudânese hid the people and camels in\r\nit. Stas, although he conjectured more or less what had happened, lay\r\nbeside Idris and pretended to sleep, hoping that the Arabs, who thus\r\nfar had exchanged but a few words about the occurrence, would now begin\r\nto speak about it. In fact, his hope was not disappointed, for\r\nimmediately after pouring out fodder for the camels, the Bedouins and\r\nthe Sudânese with Chamis sat down for a consultation.\r\n\r\n\"Henceforth we can ride only in the night; in the daytime we will have\r\nto hide!\" spoke out the one-eyed Bedouin. \"There will be many khors now\r\nand in each one of them we will find a safe hiding-place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure that he was a sentinel?\" asked Idris.\r\n\r\n\"Allah! We spoke with him. Luckily there was only one. He stood hidden\r\nby a rock, so that we could not see him, but we heard from a distance\r\nthe cry of his camel. Then we slackened our speed and rode up so\r\nquietly that he saw us only when we were a few paces away. He became\r\nvery frightened and wanted to aim his rifle at us. If he had fired,\r\nthough he might not have killed any of us, the other sentinels would\r\nhave heard the shot; so, as hurriedly as possible, I yelled to him:\r\n'Halt! we are pursuing men who kidnapped two white children, and soon\r\nthe whole pursuit will be here!' The boy was young and foolish, so he\r\nbelieved us; only he ordered us to swear on the Koran that such was the\r\ncase. We got off our camels and swore--\"\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi will absolve us--\"\r\n\r\n\"And bless you,\" said Idris. \"Speak! what did you do afterwards?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued the Bedouin, \"when we swore, I said to the boy: 'But\r\nwho can vouch that you yourself do not belong to the outlaws who are\r\nrunning away with the white children, and whether they did not leave\r\nyou here to hold back the pursuit?' And I ordered him also to take an\r\noath. To this he assented and this caused him to believe us all the\r\nmore. We began to ask him whether any orders had come over the copper\r\nwire to the sheiks and whether a pursuit was organized. He replied:\r\n'Yes!' and told us that a great reward was offered, and that all khors\r\nat a two days' distance from the river were guarded, and that the great\r\n'baburs' (steamers), with Englishmen and troops are continually\r\nfloating over the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither the 'baburs' nor the troops can avail against the might of\r\nAllah and the prophet--\"\r\n\r\n\"May it be as you say!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us how you finished with the boy?\"\r\n\r\nThe one-eyed Bedouin pointed at his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Abu-Anga,\" he said, \"asked him whether there was not another sentinel\r\nnear-by, and the sentinel replied that there was not; then Abu-Anga\r\nthrust his knife into the sentinel's throat so suddenly that he did not\r\nutter a word. We threw him into a deep cleft and covered him with\r\nstones and thorns. In the village they will think that he ran away to\r\nthe Mahdi, for he told us that this does happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God bless those who run away as he blessed you,\" answered Idris.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! He did bless us,\" retorted Abu-Anga, \"for we now know that we\r\nwill have to keep at a three days' distance from the river, and besides\r\nwe captured a rifle which we needed and a milch she-camel.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gourds,\" added the one-eyed, \"are filled with water and there is\r\nconsiderable millet in the sacks; but we found but little powder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chamis is carrying a few hundred cartridges for the white boy's rifle,\r\nfrom which we cannot shoot. Powder is always the same and can be used\r\nin ours.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, Idris nevertheless pondered, and heavy anxiety was\r\nreflected in his dark face, for he understood that when once a corpse\r\nhad fallen to the ground, Stas' intercession would not secure immunity\r\nfor them from trial and punishment, if they should fall into the hands\r\nof the Egyptian Government.\r\n\r\nStas listened with palpitating heart and strained attention. In that\r\nconversation there were some comforting things, especially that a\r\npursuit was organized, that a reward was offered, and that the sheiks\r\nof the tribes on the river banks had received orders to detain caravans\r\ngoing southward. The boy was comforted also by the intelligence about\r\nsteamers filled with English troops plying on the upper river. The\r\ndervishes of the Mahdi might cope with the Egyptian army and even\r\ndefeat it, but it was an entirely different matter with English people,\r\nand Stas did not doubt for a moment that the first battle would result\r\nin the total rout of the savage multitude. So, with comfort in his\r\nsoul, he soliloquized thus: \"Even though they wish to bring us to the\r\nMahdi, it may happen that before we reach his camp there will not be\r\nany Mahdi or his dervishes.\" But this solace was embittered by the\r\nthought that in such case there awaited them whole weeks of travel,\r\nwhich in the end must exhaust Nell's strength, and during all this time\r\nthey would be forced to remain in the company of knaves and murderers.\r\nAt the recollection of that young Arab, whom the Bedouins had butchered\r\nlike a lamb, fear and sorrow beset Stas. He decided not to speak of it\r\nto Nell in order not to frighten her and augment the sorrow she felt\r\nafter the disappearance of the illusory picture of the oasis of Fayûm\r\nand the city of Medinet. He saw before their arrival at the ravine that\r\ntears were involuntarily surging to her eyes; therefore, when he had\r\nlearned everything which he wished to know from the Bedouins'\r\nnarratives, he pretended to awake and walked towards her. She sat in a\r\ncorner near Dinah, eating dates, moistened a little with her tears. But\r\nseeing Stas, she recollected that not long before he declared that her\r\nconduct was worthy of a person of at least thirteen years; so, not\r\ndesiring to appear again as a child, she bit the kernel of a date with\r\nthe full strength of her little teeth, so as to suppress her sobs.\r\n\r\n\"Nell,\" said the boy, \"Medinet--that was an illusion, but I know for a\r\ncertainty that we are being pursued; so don't grieve, and don't cry.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the little girl raised towards him her tearful pupils and\r\nreplied in a broken voice:\r\n\r\n\"No, Stas--I do not want to cry--only my eyes--perspire so.\"\r\n\r\nBut at that moment her chin began to quiver; from under her closed\r\neyelashes big tears gushed and she wept in earnest.\r\n\r\nHowever, as she was ashamed of her tears and expected a rebuke for them\r\nfrom Stas, a little from shame and a little from fear she hid her head\r\non his bosom, wetting his clothes copiously.\r\n\r\nBut he at once consoled her.\r\n\r\n\"Nell, don't be a fountain. You saw that they took away from some Arab\r\na rifle and a she-camel. Do you know what that means? It means that the\r\ndesert is full of soldiers. Once these wretches succeeded in trapping a\r\nsentinel, but the next time they themselves will get caught. A large\r\nnumber of steamboats are plying over the Nile also--Why, of course,\r\nNell, we will return. We will return, and in a steamer to boot. Don't\r\nbe afraid.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he would have comforted her further in this manner, were not his\r\nattention attracted by a strange sound coming from the outside, from\r\nthe sand-drifts, which the hurricane blew onto the bottom of the\r\nravine. It was something resembling the thin, metallic notes of a reed\r\npipe. Stas broke off the conversation and began to listen. After a\r\nwhile these very thin and mournful sounds came from many sides\r\nsimultaneously. Through the boy's mind the thought flashed that these\r\nmight be Arabian guards surrounding the ravine and summoning aid with\r\nwhistles. His heart began to beat. He glanced once and again at the\r\nSudânese, hoping that he would behold consternation on their faces; but\r\nno! Idris, Gebhr and the two Bedouins calmly chewed biscuits, only\r\nChamis appeared a little surprised. The sounds continued. After a while\r\nIdris rose and looked out of the cavern; returning, he stopped near the\r\nchildren, and said:\r\n\r\n\"The sands are beginning to sing.\"\r\n\r\nStas' curiosity was so aroused that he forgot that he had determined\r\nnot to speak to Idris any more and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Sands? What does it mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It happens thus, and means that for a long time there will be no rain.\r\nBut the heat will not distress us, since as far as Assuan we will ride\r\nonly during the night.\"\r\n\r\nAnd no more could be learned from him. Stas and Nell listened long to\r\nthese peculiar sounds which continued until the sun descended in the\r\nwest, after which night fell and the caravan started on its further\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the daytime they hid in places concealed and difficult of access,\r\namid rocks and chasms, and during the night they hurried, without\r\nrespite, until they passed the First Cataract. When finally the\r\nBedouins discerned from the situation and form of the khors that Assuan\r\nwas behind them, a great burden fell off Idris' breast. As they\r\nsuffered already from want of water they drew nearer to the river a\r\nhalf day's distance. There Idris, concealing the caravan, sent all the\r\ncamels with the Bedouins to the Nile in order to water them well and\r\nfor a longer time. Beyond Assuan the fertile belt along the river was\r\nnarrower. In some places the desert reached the river; the villages lay\r\nat a considerable distance from each other. The Bedouins, therefore,\r\nreturned successfully, unseen by any one, with a considerable supply of\r\nwater. It was necessary now to think of provisions. As the animals had\r\nbeen fed sparingly during the past week they grew lean; their necks\r\nlengthened, their humps sank, and their legs became weak. The durra and\r\nthe supplies for the people, with the greatest stint, would suffice for\r\ntwo days more. Idris thought, however, that they might, if not during\r\ndaytime then at night, approach the pastures on the river banks and\r\nperhaps buy biscuits and dates in some village. Saba already was given\r\nnothing at all to eat or drink, and the children hid leavings of food\r\nfor him, but he somehow managed to take care of himself and came\r\nrunning to the stopping places with bleeding jaws and marks of bites on\r\nhis neck and breast. Whether the victim of these fights was a jackal,\r\nor a hyena, or perhaps a desert fox or a gazelle no one knew; it was\r\nenough that there were no signs of great hunger on him. At times also\r\nhis black lips were moist as if he drank. The Bedouins surmised that he\r\nmust have dug deep holes at the bottom of the ravines, and in this\r\nmanner reached water which he scented under the ground. In this manner\r\ntravelers who get lost dig the bottoms of chasms and, if they do not\r\noften find water, they almost always reach damp sand and, sucking it,\r\ncheat in this way the pangs of thirst. In Saba, however, considerable\r\nchanges took place. He still had a powerful breast and neck, but his\r\nsides were sunken, through which he appeared taller. In his eyes, about\r\nthe reddened whites, there was now something savage and threatening. To\r\nNell and to Stas he was as attached as previously and permitted them to\r\ndo with him whatever they pleased. He still at times wagged his tail at\r\nChamis, but he growled at the Bedouins and Sudânese or snapped with his\r\nterrible teeth, which at such times clashed against each other like\r\nsteel nails. Idris and Gebhr plainly began to fear and hate him to the\r\nextent that they would have killed him with the captured rifle, were it\r\nnot that they desired to bring this extraordinary animal to Smain, and\r\nwere it not also that they had already passed Assuan.\r\n\r\nThey had passed Assuan! Stas thought of this continually, and doubt\r\nthat the pursuit would ever overtake them stole gradually into his\r\nsoul. He knew, indeed, that not only Egypt proper, which ends at Wâdi\r\nHaifa, that is, at the Second Cataract, but the whole of Nubia was up\r\nto that time in the hands of the Egyptian Government, but he also\r\nunderstood that beyond Assuan and particularly Wâdi Haifa the pursuit\r\nwould be more difficult and the commands of the Government would be\r\nexecuted carelessly. His only hope was that his father with Mr.\r\nRawlinson, after making arrangements for the pursuit from Fayûm, would\r\ngo to Wâdi Haifa by steamer, and there securing troops of the\r\ncamel-corps, would endeavor to intercept the caravan from the south.\r\nThe boy reasoned that if he were in their place he would do just this,\r\nand for that reason he assumed that his supposition was very probable.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, abandon the thought of a rescue on his own\r\naccount. The Sudânese wanted to have powder for the captured rifle and\r\nwith this object decided to disjoin a score of the rifle cartridges, so\r\nhe told them that he alone was able to do that, and that if any one of\r\nthem should undertake the task unskilfully, the cartridge would explode\r\nin his fingers and tear off his hands. Idris, fearing English\r\ninventions and unknown things generally, determined finally to entrust\r\nthe boy with this undertaking. Stas went at it willingly, hoping in the\r\nfirst place that the powerful English powder at the first shot would\r\nburst the old Arabian rifle to pieces, and, again, that he might be\r\nable to hide a few cartridges. In fact, he succeeded more easily than\r\nhe expected. Apparently they watched him at the work, but the Arabs\r\nbegan at once to talk among themselves and soon they were more occupied\r\nwith their conversation than with their supervision. Finally this\r\nloquacity and inbred carelessness permitted Stas to conceal in his\r\nbosom seven cartridges. Now all that was necessary was to secure the\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nThe boy judged that beyond Wâdi Haifa, the Second Cataract, this would\r\nnot be a very difficult matter as he foresaw that as they drew nearer\r\nto their destination the Arabs' vigilance would relax. The thought that\r\nhe would have to kill the Sudânese, the Bedouins, and even Chamis,\r\nalways caused him to shudder, but after the murder which the Bedouins\r\nhad committed, he did not have any scruples. He said to himself that\r\nthe defense, liberty, and life of Nell were involved, and in view of\r\nthis the lives of his adversaries did not deserve any consideration,\r\nespecially if they did not surrender and it came to a fight.\r\n\r\nBut he was anxious about the short rifle. Stas resolved to secure it by\r\nstratagem, whenever the opportunity presented itself, and not to wait\r\nuntil they reached Wâdi Haifa, but perform the deed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he did not wait.\r\n\r\nTwo days had elapsed since they passed Assuan, and Idris finally at the\r\ndawn of the third day was forced to despatch the Bedouins for\r\nprovisions, which were totally lacking. In view of the diminished\r\nnumber of adversaries Stas said to himself: \"Now or never!\" and\r\nimmediately turned to the Sudânese with the following question:\r\n\r\n\"Idris, do you know that the country which begins not far beyond Wâdi\r\nHaifa is really Nubia?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I was fifteen years old and Gebhr eight, when my father took\r\nus from the Sudân to Fayûm, and I remember that we rode at that time on\r\ncamels over the whole of Nubia. But this country belongs still to the\r\nTurks (Egyptians).\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The Mahdi is only before Khartûm and you see how foolishly Chamis\r\nchattered when he told you that the army of dervishes reached as far as\r\nAssuan. However, I shall ask you something else. Now I have read that\r\nin Nubia there are many wild animals and many brigands who do not serve\r\nany one and who attack alike the Egyptians and the faithful Mahdists.\r\nWith what will you defend yourself, if wild animals or brigands attack\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nStas purposely exaggerated in speaking of wild animals, but, on the\r\nother hand, highway robberies in Nubia, from the time of the war,\r\noccurred quite frequently, particularly in the southern part of the\r\ncountry bordering upon the Sudân.\r\n\r\nIdris pondered for a while over the question, which surprised him, as\r\nheretofore he had not thought of these new dangers, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"We have knives and a rifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a rifle is good for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Yours is better, but we do not know how to shoot from it, and\r\nwe will not place it in your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even unloaded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for it may be bewitched.\"\r\n\r\nStas shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Idris, if Gebhr said that, I would not be surprised, but I thought\r\nthat you had more sense. From an unloaded rifle even your Mahdi could\r\nnot fire--\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" interrupted Idris sternly. \"The Mahdi is able to fire even\r\nfrom his finger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you also can fire in that way.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sudânese looked keenly into the boy's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want me to give you the rifle?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to teach you how to fire from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should that concern you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A great deal, for if the brigands attack us they might kill us all.\r\nBut if you are afraid of the rifle and of me then it does not matter.\"\r\n\r\nIdris was silent. In reality he was afraid, but did not want to admit\r\nit. He was anxious, however, to get acquainted with the English weapon,\r\nfor its possession and skill in its use would increase his importance\r\nin the Mahdists' camp, to say nothing of the fact that it would be\r\neasier for him to defend himself in case of an attack.\r\n\r\nSo after a brief consideration he said:\r\n\r\n\"Good. Let Chamis hand you the rifle-case and you can take it out.\"\r\n\r\nChamis indifferently performed the order, which Gebhr could not oppose,\r\nas he was occupied at some distance with the camels. Stas with\r\nquivering hands took out the stock and afterwards the barrels, and\r\nhanded them to Idris.\r\n\r\n\"You see they are empty.\"\r\n\r\nIdris took the barrels and peered upwards through them.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is nothing in them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now observe,\" said Stas. \"This is the way to put a rifle together\"\r\n(and saying this he united the barrel and stock). \"This is the way to\r\nopen it. Do you see? I will take it apart again and you can put it\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sudânese, who watched Stas' motions with great attention, tried to\r\nimitate him. At first it was not easy for him, but as Arabians are well\r\nknown for their skilfulness, the rifle, after a while, was put together.\r\n\r\n\"Open!\" commanded Stas.\r\n\r\nIdris opened the rifle easily.\r\n\r\n\"Close.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done yet more easily.\r\n\r\n\"Now give me two empty shells. I will teach you how to load the\r\ncartridges.\"\r\n\r\nThe Arabs had kept the empty cartridges as they had a value for them as\r\nbrass; so Idris handed two of them to Stas and the instruction began\r\nanew.\r\n\r\nThe Sudânese at first was frightened a little by the crack of the caps\r\nof the shells, but finally became convinced that no one was able to\r\nfire from empty barrels and empty shells. In addition, his trust in\r\nStas returned because the boy handed the weapon to him every little\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Stas, \"you already know how to put a rifle together, you\r\nknow how to open, to close, and to pull the trigger. But now it is\r\nnecessary for you to learn to aim. That is the most difficult thing.\r\nTake that empty water gourd and place it at a hundred paces--on those\r\nstones, and afterwards return to me; I will show you how to aim.\"\r\n\r\nIdris took the gourd and without the slightest hesitation walked to the\r\nplace by the stones which Stas had indicated. But before he made the\r\nfirst hundred steps, Stas extracted the empty shells and substituted\r\nloaded cartridges. Not only his heart but the arteries in his temples\r\nbegan to throb with such a force that he thought that his head would\r\nburst. The decisive moment arrived--the moment of freedom for Nell and\r\nhimself--the moment of victory--terrible and at the same time desirable.\r\n\r\nNow Idris' life was in his hands. One pull of the trigger and the\r\ntraitor who had kidnapped Nell would fall a corpse. But Stas, who had\r\nin his veins both Polish and French blood, suddenly felt that for\r\nnothing in the world could he be capable of shooting a man in the back.\r\nLet him at least turn around and face death in the eye. And after that,\r\nwhat? After that, Gebhr would come rushing up, and before he ran ten\r\npaces he also would bite the dust. Chamis would remain. But Chamis\r\nwould lose his head, and even though he should not lose it, there would\r\nbe time to insert new cartridges in the barrels. When the Bedouins\r\narrived, they would find three corpses, and meet a fate they richly\r\ndeserved. After that he would only have to guide the camels to the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nAll these thoughts and pictures flew like a whirlwind through Stas'\r\nbrain. He felt that what was to happen after a few minutes was at the\r\nsame time horrible and imperative. The pride of a conqueror surged in\r\nhis breast with a feeling of aversion for the dreadful deed. There was\r\na moment when he hesitated, but he recalled the tortures which the\r\nwhite prisoners endured; he recalled his father, Mr. Rawlinson, Nell,\r\nalso Gebhr, who struck the little girl with a courbash, and hatred\r\nburst out in him with renewed force. \"It is necessary!\" he said through\r\nhis set teeth, and inflexible determination was reflected on his\r\ncountenance, which became as if carved out of stone.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Idris placed the gourd on a stone about a hundred paces\r\ndistant and turned around. Stas saw his smiling face and his whole tall\r\nform upon the plain. For the last time the thought flashed through his\r\nmind that this living man would fall after a moment upon the ground,\r\nclutching the sand with his fingers in the last convulsions of the\r\nthroes of death. But the hesitation of the boy ended, and when Idris\r\nsauntered fifty paces toward him, he began slowly to raise the weapon\r\nto his eye.\r\n\r\nBut before he touched the trigger with his finger, from beyond the\r\ndunes, about a few hundred paces distant, could be heard tumultuous\r\ncheers, and in the same minute about twenty riders on horses and camels\r\ndebouched on the plain. Idris became petrified at the sight. Stas was\r\namazed no less, but at once amazement gave way to insane joy. The\r\nexpected pursuit at last! Yes! That could not be anything else.\r\nEvidently the Bedouins had been captured in a village and were showing\r\nwhere the rest of the caravan was concealed! Idris thought the same.\r\nWhen he collected himself he ran to Stas, with face ashen from terror,\r\nand, kneeling at his feet, began to repeat in a voice out of breath:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I was kind to you! I was kind to the little 'bint'! Remember\r\nthat!\"\r\n\r\nStas mechanically extracted the cartridges from the barrels and gazed.\r\nThe riders drove horses and camels at the fullest speed, shouting from\r\njoy and flinging upwards their long Arabian rifles, which they caught\r\nwhile in full gallop with extraordinary dexterity. In the bright\r\ntransparent air they could be seen perfectly. In the middle, at the\r\nvan, ran the two Bedouins waving their hands and burnooses as if\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes the whole band dashed to the caravan. Some of the\r\nriders leaped off the horses and camels; some remained on their\r\nsaddles, yelling at the top of their voices. Amid these shouts only two\r\nwords could be distinguished.\r\n\r\n\"Khartûm! Gordon! Gordon! Khartûm!\"\r\n\r\nFinally one of the Bedouins--the one whom his companion called\r\nAbu-Anga--ran up to Idris cringing at Stas' feet, and began to exclaim:\r\n\r\n\"Khartûm is taken! Gordon is killed! The Mahdi is victorious!\"\r\n\r\nIdris stood erect but did not yet believe his ears.\r\n\r\n\"And these men?\" he asked with quivering lips.\r\n\r\n\"These men were to seize us, but now are going together with us to the\r\nprophet.\"\r\n\r\nStas' head swam.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the last hope of escaping during the journey had\r\nbecome extinct. Stas now knew that his schemes would avail nothing;\r\nthat the pursuit would not overtake them, and that if they endured the\r\nhardships of the journey they would reach the Mahdi and would be\r\nsurrendered to Smain. The only consolation now was the thought that\r\nthey were kidnapped so that Smain might exchange them for his children.\r\nBut when would that happen, and what would they encounter before that\r\ntime? What dreadful misfortune awaited them among the savage hordes\r\nintoxicated with blood? Would Nell be able to endure all these fatigues\r\nand privations?\r\n\r\nThis no one could answer. On the other hand, it was known that the\r\nMahdi and his dervishes hated Christians, and Europeans in general; so\r\nin the soul of the boy there was bred a fear that the influence of\r\nSmain might not be sufficient to shield them from indignities, from\r\nrough treatment, from the cruelties and the rage of the Mahdist\r\nbelievers, who even murdered Mohammedans loyal to the Government. For\r\nthe first time since the abduction deep despair beset the boy, and at\r\nthe same time some kind of vague notion that an untoward fate was\r\npersecuting them. Why, the idea itself of abducting them from Fayûm and\r\nconveying them to Khartûm was sheer madness which could be committed\r\nonly by such wild and foolish men as Idris and Gebhr, not understanding\r\nthat they would have to traverse thousands of kilometers over a country\r\nsubject to the Egyptian Government or, more properly, English people.\r\nWith proper methods they ought to have been caught on the second day,\r\nand nevertheless everything combined so that now they were not far from\r\nthe Second Cataract and none of the preceding pursuing parties had\r\novertaken them, and the last one which could have detained them joined\r\nthe kidnappers and, from this time, would aid them. To Stas' despair,\r\nto his fears about little Nell's fate, was linked a feeling of\r\nhumiliation that he was unequal to the situation and, what was more,\r\nwas unable now to devise anything, for even if they returned the rifle\r\nand cartridges to him, he could not, of course, shoot all the Arabs\r\ncomposing the caravan.\r\n\r\nAnd he was gnawed all the more by these thoughts because deliverance\r\nhad been already so near. If Khartûm had not fallen, or if it had\r\nfallen only a few days later, these same men, who went over to the side\r\nof the Mahdi, would have seized their captors and delivered them to the\r\nGovernment. Stas, sitting on the camel behind Idris and listening to\r\ntheir conversation, became convinced that this undoubtedly would have\r\nhappened. For, immediately after they proceeded upon their further\r\njourney, the leader of the pursuing party began to relate to Idris what\r\ninduced them to commit treason to the Khedive. They knew previously\r\nthat a great army--not an Egyptian now but an English one--had started\r\nsouthward against the dervishes under the command of General Wolseley.\r\nThey saw a multitude of steamers, which carried formidable English\r\nsoldiers from Assuan to Wâdi Haifa, from whence a railroad was built\r\nfor them to Abu Hâmed. For a long time all the sheiks on the river\r\nbanks,--those who remained loyal to the Government as well as those who\r\nin the depth of their souls favored the Mahdi,--were certain that the\r\ndestruction of the dervishes and their prophet was inevitable, for no\r\none had ever vanquished the Englishmen.\r\n\r\n\"Akbar Allah!\" interrupted Idris, raising his hands upwards.\r\n\"Nevertheless, they have been vanquished.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the leader of the pursuing party. \"The Mahdi sent against\r\nthem the tribes of Jaalin, Barabra, and Janghey, nearly thirty thousand\r\nin all of his best warriors, under the command of Musa, the son of\r\nHelu. At Abu Klea a terrible battle took place in which God awarded the\r\nvictory to the unbelievers.--Yes, it is so. Musa, the son of Helu,\r\nfell, and of his soldiers only a handful returned to the Mahdi. The\r\nsouls of the others are in Paradise, while their bodies lie upon the\r\nsands, awaiting the day of resurrection. News of this spread rapidly\r\nover the Nile. Then we thought that the English would go farther south\r\nand relieve Khartûm. The people repeated, 'The end! the end!' And in\r\nthe meantime God disposed otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? What happened?\" asked Idris feverishly.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" said the leader with a brightened countenance. \"Why,\r\nin the meantime the Mahdi captured Khartûm, and during the assault\r\nGordon's head was cut off. And as the Englishmen were concerned only\r\nabout Gordon, learning of his death, they returned to the north. Allah!\r\nWe again saw the steamers with the stalwart soldiers floating down the\r\nriver, but did not understand what it meant. The English publish good\r\nnews immediately and suppress bad. Some of our people said that the\r\nMahdi had already perished. But finally the truth came to the surface.\r\nThis region belongs yet to the Government. In Wâdi Haifa and farther,\r\nas far as the Third and perhaps the Fourth Cataract, the soldiers of\r\nthe Khedive can be found; nevertheless, after the retirement of the\r\nEnglish troops, we believe now that the Mahdi will subdue not only\r\nNubia and Egypt, not only Mecca and Medina, but the whole world. For\r\nthat reason instead of capturing you and delivering you to the hands of\r\nthe Government we are going together with you to the prophet.\"\r\n\r\n\"So orders came to capture us?\"\r\n\r\n\"To all the villages, to all the sheiks, to the military garrisons.\r\nWherever the copper wire, over which fly the commands of the Khedive,\r\ndoes not reach, there came the 'zabdis' (gendarmes) with the\r\nannouncement that whoever captures you will receive one thousand pounds\r\nreward. Mashallah!--That is great wealth!--Great!\"\r\n\r\nIdris glanced suspiciously at the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"But you prefer the blessing of the Mahdi?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He captured such immense booty and so much money in Khartûm that\r\nhe measures the Egyptian pounds in fodder sacks and distributes them\r\namong his faithful--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, if the Egyptian troops are yet in Wâdi Haifa, and\r\nfurther, they may seize us on the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It is necessary only to hurry before they recover their wits. Now\r\nsince the retreat of the Englishmen they have lost their heads\r\nentirely--the sheiks, the loyal to the Government, as well as the\r\nsoldiers and 'zabdis.' All think that the Mahdi at any moment will\r\narrive; for that reason those of us who in our souls favored him are\r\nnow running to him boldly, and nobody is pursuing us, for in the first\r\nmoments no one is issuing orders and no one knows whom to obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Idris, \"you say truly that it is necessary to hurry,\r\nbefore they recover their wits, since Khartûm is yet far--\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant a faint gleam of hope glimmered again for Stas. If the\r\nEgyptian soldiers up to that time occupied various localities on the\r\nbanks in Nubia, then in view of the fact that the English troops had\r\ntaken all the steamers, they would have to retreat before the Mahdi's\r\nhordes by land. In such case it might happen that the caravan would\r\nencounter some retreating detachment and might be surrounded. Stas\r\nreckoned also that before the news of the capture of Khartûm circulated\r\namong the Arabian tribes north of Wâdi Haifa, considerable time would\r\nelapse; the more so as the Egyptian Government and the English people\r\nsuppressed it. He therefore assumed that the panic which must have\r\nprevailed among the Egyptians in the first moment must have already\r\npassed away. To the inexperienced boy it never occurred that in any\r\nevent the downfall of Khartûm and the death of Gordon would cause\r\npeople to forget about everything else, and that the sheiks loyal to\r\nthe Government as well as the local authorities would now have\r\nsomething else to do than to think of rescuing two white children.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact the Arabs who joined the caravan did not fear the pursuit\r\nvery much. They rode with great haste and did not spare the camels, but\r\nthey kept close to the Nile and often during the night turned to the\r\nriver to water the animals and to fill the leather bags with water. At\r\ntimes they ventured to ride to villages even in daytime. For safety\r\nthey sent in advance for scouting a few men who, under the pretext of\r\nbuying provisions, inquired for news of the locality; whether there\r\nwere any Egyptian troops near-by and whether the inhabitants belonged\r\nto \"the loyal Turks.\" If they met residents secretly favoring the\r\nMahdi, then the entire caravan would visit the village, and often it\r\nhappened that it was increased by a few or even a dozen or more young\r\nArabs who also wanted to fly to the Mahdi.\r\n\r\nIdris learned also that almost all the Egyptian detachments were\r\nstationed on the side of the Nubian Desert, therefore on the right, the\r\neastern side of the Nile. In order to avoid an encounter with them it\r\nwas necessary only to keep to the left bank and to pass by the larger\r\ncities and settlements. This indeed lengthened their route a great\r\ndeal, for the river, beginning at Wâdi Haifa, forms a gigantic arch\r\ninclining far towards the south and afterwards again curving to the\r\nnortheast as far as Abu Hâmed, where it takes a direct southern course,\r\nbut on the other hand this left bank, particularly from the Oasis of\r\nSelimeh, was left almost entirely unguarded. The journey passed merrily\r\nfor the Sudânese in an increased company with an abundance of water and\r\nsupplies. Passing the Third Cataract, they ceased even to hurry, and\r\nrode only at night, hiding during the day among sandy hills and ravines\r\nwith which the whole desert was intersected. A cloudless sky now\r\nextended over them, gray at the horizon's edges, bulging in the center\r\nlike a gigantic cupola, silent and calm. With each day, however, the\r\nheat, in proportion to their southward advance, became more and more\r\nterrible, and even in the ravines, in the deep shade, it distressed the\r\npeople and the beasts. On the other hand, the nights were very cool;\r\nthey scintillated with twinkling stars which formed, as it were,\r\ngreater and smaller clusters. Stas observed that they were not the same\r\nconstellations which shone at night over Port Said. At times he had\r\ndreamed of seeing sometime in his life the Southern Cross, and finally\r\nbeheld it beyond El-Ordeh. But at present its luster proclaimed to him\r\nhis own misfortune. For a few nights there shone for him the pale,\r\nscattered, and sad zodiacal light, which, after the waning of the\r\nevening twilight, silvered until a late hour the western side of the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn two weeks after starting from the neighborhood of Wâdi Haifa the\r\ncaravan entered upon the region subdued by the Mahdi. They speedily\r\ncrossed the hilly Jesira Desert, and near Shendi, where previously the\r\nEnglish forces had completely routed Musa, Uled of Helu, they rode into\r\na locality entirely unlike the desert. Neither sands nor dunes could be\r\nseen here. As far as the eye could reach stretched a steppe overgrown\r\nin part by green grass and in part by a jungle amid which grew clusters\r\nof thorny acacias, yielding the well-known Sudânese gum; while here and\r\nthere stood solitary gigantic nabbuk trees, so expansive that under\r\ntheir boughs a hundred people could find shelter from the sun. From\r\ntime to time the caravan passed by high, pillar-like hillocks of\r\ntermites or white ants, with which tropical Africa is strewn. The\r\nverdure of the pasture and the acacias agreeably charmed the eyes after\r\nthe monotonous, tawny-hued sands of the desert.\r\n\r\nIn the places where the steppe was a meadow, herds of camels pastured,\r\nguarded by the armed warriors of the Mahdi. At the sight of the caravan\r\nthey started up suddenly, like birds of prey; rushed towards it,\r\nsurrounded it from all sides; and shaking their spears and at the same\r\ntime yelling at the top of their voices they asked the men from whence\r\nthey came, why they were going southward, and whither they were bound?\r\nAt times they assumed such a threatening attitude that Idris was\r\ncompelled to reply to their questions in the greatest haste in order to\r\navoid attack.\r\n\r\nStas, who had imagined that the inhabitants of the Sudân differed from\r\nother Arabs residing in Egypt only in this, that they believed in the\r\nMahdi and did not want to acknowledge the authority of the Khedive,\r\nperceived that he was totally mistaken. The greater part of those who\r\nevery little while stopped the caravan had skins darker than even Idris\r\nand Gebhr, and in comparison with the two Bedouins were almost black.\r\nThe negro blood in them predominated over the Arabian. Their faces and\r\nbreasts were tattooed and the prickings represented various designs, or\r\ninscriptions from the Koran. Some were almost naked; others wore\r\n\"jubhas\" or wrappers of cotton texture sewed out of patches of various\r\ncolors. A great many had twigs of coral or pieces of ivory in their\r\npierced nostrils, lips and ears. The heads of the leaders were covered\r\nwith caps of the same texture as the wrappers, and the heads of common\r\nwarriors were bare, but not shaven like those of the Arabs in Egypt. On\r\nthe contrary, they were covered with enormous twisted locks, often\r\nsinged red with lime, with which they rubbed their tufts of hair for\r\nprotection against vermin. Their weapons were mainly spears, terrible\r\nin their hands; but they did not lack Remington carbines which they had\r\ncaptured in their victorious battles with the Egyptian army and after\r\nthe fall of Khartûm. The sight of them was terrifying and their\r\nbehavior toward the caravan was hostile, for they suspected that it\r\nconsisted of Egyptian traders, whom the Mahdi, in the first moments\r\nafter the victory, prohibited from entering the Sudân.\r\n\r\nHaving surrounded the caravan, they pointed the spears with tumult and\r\nmenace at the breasts of the people, or aimed carbines at them. To this\r\nhostile demonstration Idris answered with a shout that he and his\r\nbrother belonged to the Dongolese tribe, the same as that of the Mahdi,\r\nand that they were conveying to the prophet two white children as\r\nslaves; this alone restrained the savages from violence. In Stas, when\r\nhe came in contact with this dire reality, the spirit withered at the\r\nthought of what awaited them on the ensuing days. Idris, also, who\r\npreviously had lived long years in a civilized community, had never\r\nimagined anything like this. He was pleased when one night they were\r\nsurrounded by an armed detachment of the Emir Nur el-Tadhil and\r\nconducted to Khartûm.\r\n\r\nNur el-Tadhil, before he ran away to the Mahdi, was an Egyptian officer\r\nin a negro regiment of the Khedive: so he was not so savage as the\r\nother Mahdists and Idris could more easily make himself understood. But\r\nhere disappointment awaited him. He imagined that his arrival at the\r\nMahdi's camp with the white children would excite admiration, if only\r\non account of the extraordinary hardships and dangers of the journey.\r\nHe expected that the Mahdists would receive him with ardor, with open\r\narms, and lead him in triumph to the prophet, who would lavish gold and\r\npraises upon him as a man who had not hesitated to expose his head in\r\norder to serve his relative Fatma. In the meantime the Mahdists placed\r\nspears at the breasts of members of the caravan, and Nur el-Tadhil\r\nheard quite indifferently his narrative of the journey, and finally to\r\nthe question, whether he knew Smain, the husband of Fatma, answered:\r\n\r\n\"No. In Omdurmân and Khartûm there are over one hundred thousand\r\nwarriors, so it is easy not to meet one another, and not all the\r\nofficers are acquainted with each other. The domain of the prophet is\r\nimmense; therefore many emirs rule in distant cities in Sennâr, in\r\nKordofân, and Darfur, and around Fashoda. It may be that this Smain, of\r\nwhom you speak, is not at present at the prophet's side.\"\r\n\r\nIdris was nettled by the slighting tone with which Nur spoke of \"this\r\nSmain,\" so he replied with a shade of impatience:\r\n\r\n\"Smain is married to a first cousin of the Mahdi, and therefore Smain's\r\nchildren are relatives of the prophet.\"\r\n\r\nNur el-Tadhil shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi has many relatives and cannot remember all of them.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time they rode in silence; after which Idris again asked:\r\n\r\n\"How soon shall we arrive at Khartûm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before midnight,\" replied el-Tadhil, gazing at the stars which began\r\nto appear in the eastern part of the heavens.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we at that late hour be able to obtain food and fodder? Since\r\nour last rest at noon we have not eaten anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will pass this night with me and I shall feed you in my house, but\r\nto-morrow in Omdurmân you will have to seek for food yourself, and I\r\nwarn you in advance that this will not be an easy matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we have a war. The people for the past few years have not\r\ntilled the fields and have lived solely upon meat; so when finally\r\ncattle were lacking, famine came. There is famine in all the Sudân, and\r\na sack of durra today costs more than a slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allah akbar!\" exclaimed Idris with surprise, \"I saw nevertheless herds\r\nof camels and cattle on the steppes.\"\r\n\r\n\"They belong to the prophet, to the 'Noble,'* [* The Noble brothers and\r\nrelatives of the Mahdi.] and to the caliphs.--Yes--The Dongolese, from\r\nwhich tribe the Mahdi came and the Baggara, whose leader is the chief\r\ncaliph, Abdullahi, have still quite numerous herds, but for other\r\ntribes it has become more and more difficult to live in the world.\"\r\n\r\nHere Nur el-Tadhil patted his stomach, and said:\r\n\r\n\"In the service of the prophet I have a higher rank, more money, and a\r\ngreater authority, but I had a fuller stomach in the Khedive's service.\"\r\n\r\nBut, realizing that he might have said too much, after a while he added:\r\n\r\n\"But all this will change when the true faith conquers.\"\r\n\r\nIdris, hearing these words, involuntarily thought that nevertheless in\r\nFayûm, in the service of the Englishmen, he had never suffered from\r\nhunger, and gains could be more easily secured; so he was cast into a\r\ndeep gloom.\r\n\r\nAfter which he began to ask further:\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to transport us to-morrow to Omdurmân?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Khartûm by command of the prophet is to be abandoned and very few\r\nreside there. They are razing the large buildings and conveying the\r\nbricks with the other booty to Omdurmân. The prophet does not wish to\r\nlive in a place polluted by unbelievers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall beat my forehead before him to-morrow, and he will command\r\nthat I be supplied with provisions and fodder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! If in truth you belong to the Dongolese, then perhaps you might be\r\nadmitted to his presence. But know this, that his house is guarded day\r\nand night by a hundred men equipped with courbashes, and these do not\r\nspare blows to those who crave to see the Mahdi without permission.\r\nOtherwise the swarm would not give the holy man a moment of\r\nrest--Allah! I saw even Dongolese with bloody welts on their backs--\"\r\n\r\nIdris with each moment was possessed by greater disillusionment.\r\n\r\n\"So the faithful do not see the prophet?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The faithful see him daily at the place of prayer where, kneeling on\r\nthe sheep's hide, he raises his hands to God, or when he instructs the\r\nswarm and strengthens them in the true faith. But it is difficult to\r\nreach and speak with him, and whoever attains that happiness is envied\r\nby all, for upon him flows the divine grace which wipes away his former\r\nsins.\"\r\n\r\nA deep night fell and with it came a piercing chill. In the ranks\r\nresounded the snorting of horses; the sudden change from the daily heat\r\nto cold was so strong that the hides of the steeds began to reek, and\r\nthe detachment rode as if in a mist. Stas, behind Idris, leaned towards\r\nNell and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Do you feel cold?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the little girl, \"but no one will protect us now--\"\r\n\r\nAnd tears stifled her further words.\r\n\r\nThis time he did not find any comfort for her, for he himself was\r\nconvinced that there was no salvation for them. Now they rode over a\r\nregion of wretchedness, famine, bestial cruelties, and blood. They were\r\nlike two poor little leaves in a storm which bore death and\r\nannihilation not only to the heads of individuals, but to whole towns\r\nand entire tribes. What hand could snatch from it and save two small,\r\ndefenseless children?\r\n\r\nThe moon rolled high in the heaven and changed, as if into silvery\r\nfeathers, the mimosa and acacia twigs. In the dense jungles resounded\r\nhere and there the shrill and, at the same time, mockingly mirthful\r\nlaugh of the hyenas, which in that gory region found far too many\r\ncorpses. From time to time the detachment conducting the caravan\r\nencountered other patrols and exchanged with them the agreed\r\ncountersign. They came to the hills on the river banks and through a\r\nlong pass reached the Nile. The people and the camels embarked upon\r\nwide and flat \"dahabeahs,\" and soon the heavy oars began with measured\r\nmovements to break and ruffle the smooth river's depth, strewn with\r\nstarry diamonds.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of half an hour, on the southern side, on which\r\ndahabeahs floated upon the water, flashed lights which, as crafts\r\napproached them, changed into sheaves of red luster lying on the water.\r\nNur el-Tadhil shook Idris' arm, after which, stretching out his hand\r\nbefore him, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Khartûm!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThey stopped at the city's limits in a house which formerly was the\r\nproperty of a rich Italian merchant, and after his murder during the\r\nassault upon the city, had fallen to Tadhil at the division of the\r\nspoils. The wives of the emir in quite a humane manner took charge of\r\nNell who was barely alive after the rough treatment, and, though in all\r\nKhartûm could be felt a want of provisions, they found for the little\r\n\"jan\"* [* \"Jan,\" an expression of endearment, like \"little lamb.\"] a\r\nfew dried dates and a little rice with honey; after which they led her\r\nupstairs and put her to bed. Stas, who passed the night among the\r\ncamels and horses in the courtyard, had to be content with one biscuit;\r\non the other hand, he did not lack water, for the fountain in the\r\ngarden, by a strange chance, was not wrecked. Notwithstanding great\r\nweariness, he could not sleep; first on account of scorpions creeping\r\nincessantly over the saddle-cloth on which he lay, and again on account\r\nof a mortal dread that they would separate him from Nell, and that he\r\nwould not be able to watch over her personally. This uneasiness was\r\nevidently shared by Saba, who scented about and from time to time\r\nhowled, all of which enraged the soldiers. Stas quieted him as well as\r\nhe could from fear that some injury might be done to him. Fortunately\r\nthe giant mastiff aroused such admiration in the emir himself and in\r\nall the dervishes that no one lifted a hand against him.\r\n\r\nIdris also did not sleep. From the previous day he had felt unwell and,\r\nbesides, after the conversation with Nur el-Tadhil he lost many of his\r\ndelusions, and gazed at the future as though through a thick veil. He\r\nwas glad that on the morrow they would be transported to Omdurmân,\r\nwhich was separated from Khartûm only by the width of the White Nile;\r\nhe had a hope that he would find Smain there, but what further? During\r\nthe journey everything had presented itself to him somewhat more\r\ndistinctly and far more splendidly. He sincerely believed in the\r\nprophet and his heart was drawn all the more to him because both came\r\nfrom the same tribe. But in addition he was, like almost every Arab,\r\ncovetous and ambitious. He had dreamed that he would be loaded with\r\ngold and made an emir at least; he had dreamed of military expeditions\r\nagainst the \"Turks,\" of captured cities and spoils. Now, after what he\r\nhad heard from el-Tadhil, he began to fear whether in the presence of\r\nfar greater events, all his acts would not fade into insignificance,\r\njust as a drop of rain disappears in the sea. \"Perhaps,\" he thought\r\nwith bitterness, \"nobody will pay attention to what I have\r\naccomplished, and Smain will not even be pleased that I have brought\r\nthose children to him;\" and he was gnawed by this thought. The morrow\r\nwas to dispel or confirm those fears; so he awaited it with impatience.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose at six o'clock, and the bustle among the dervishes began.\r\nNur el-Tadhil soon appeared and ordered them to prepare for the\r\njourney. He declared at the same time that they would go to the ferry\r\non foot, beside his horse. To Stas' great joy, Dinah led Nell from an\r\nupper floor; after which they proceeded on the rampart, skirting the\r\nwhole city, as far as the place at which the ferry boats stopped. Nur\r\nel-Tadhil rode ahead on horseback. Stas escorted Nell by the hand;\r\nafter them came Idris, Gebhr, and Chamis, with Dinah and Saba, as well\r\nas thirty of the emir's soldiers. The rest of the caravan remained in\r\nKhartûm.\r\n\r\nStas, gazing around, could not understand how a city so strongly\r\nfortified, and lying in a fork formed by the White and Blue Niles, and\r\ntherefore surrounded on three sides by water and accessible only from\r\nthe south, could fall. Only later did he learn from a Christian slave\r\nthat the river at that time had subsided and left a wide sandy strip,\r\nwhich facilitated access to the ramparts. The garrison, losing hope of\r\nrelief and reduced by hunger, could not repel the assault of the\r\ninfuriated savages, and the city was captured; after which a massacre\r\nof the inhabitants took place. Traces of the battle, though a month had\r\nalready elapsed since the assault, could everywhere be seen along the\r\nramparts; on the inside protruded the ruins of razed buildings against\r\nwhich the first impetus of the victors had been directed and on the\r\noutside the moat was full of corpses, which no one thought of burying.\r\nBefore they reached the ferry Stas counted over four hundred. They did\r\nnot, however, infect the air as the Sudânese sun dried them up like\r\nmummies; all had the hue of gray parchment, and were so much alike that\r\nthe bodies of the Europeans, Egyptians, and negroes could not be\r\ndistinguished from each other. Amid the corpses swarmed small gray\r\nlizards, which, at the approach of men, quickly hid under those human\r\nremains and often in the mouths or between the dried-up ribs.\r\n\r\nStas walked with Nell in such a manner as to hide this horrible sight\r\nfrom her, and told her to look in the direction of the city.\r\n\r\nBut from the side of the city many things transpired which struck the\r\neyes and soul of the little girl with terror. The sight of the\r\n\"English\" children, taken into captivity, and of Saba led with a leash\r\nby Chamis attracted a throng, which as the procession proceeded to the\r\nferry increased with each moment. The throng after a certain time\r\nbecame so great that it was necessary to halt. From all sides came\r\nthreatening outcries. Frightfully tattooed faces leaned over Stas and\r\nover Nell. Some of the savages burst out into laughter at the sight of\r\nthem and from joy slapped their hips with the palms of their hands;\r\nothers cursed them; some roared like wild beasts, displaying their\r\nwhite teeth and rolling their eyes; finally they began to threaten and\r\nreach out towards them with knives. Nell, partly unconscious from\r\nfright, clung to Stas, while he shielded her as well as he knew how, in\r\nthe conviction that their last hour was approaching. Fortunately this\r\npersistent molestation of the brutal swarm at last disgusted even Nur\r\nel-Tadhil. By his command between ten and twenty soldiers surrounded\r\nthe children, while the others began, without mercy, to scourge the\r\nhowling mob with courbashes. The concourse dispersed hurriedly, but on\r\nthe other hand a mob began to gather behind the detachment and amid\r\nwild shrieks accompanied it to the boat.\r\n\r\nThe children breathed more freely during the passage over the river.\r\nStas comforted Nell with the statement that when the dervishes became\r\naccustomed to the sight of them they would cease their threats, and he\r\nassured her that Smain would protect and defend both of them, and\r\nparticularly her, for if any evil should befall them he would not have\r\nany one to exchange for his children. This was the truth, but the\r\nlittle girl was so terror-stricken by the previous assaults that,\r\nhaving seized Stas' hand, she did not want to let go of it for a\r\nmoment, repeating continually, as if in a fever: \"I am afraid! I am\r\nafraid!\" He with his whole soul wished to get as soon as possible into\r\nthe hands of Smain, who knew them of old, and who in Port Said had\r\ndisplayed great friendship towards them, or at least had pretended to\r\ndisplay it. At any rate he was not so wild as the other Dongolese of\r\nthe Sudân, and captivity in his house would be more endurable.\r\n\r\nThe only concern now was whether they would find him in Omdurmân. Of\r\nthis Idris spoke with Nur el-Tadhil, who at last recollected that a\r\nyear before, while tarrying by the order of the caliph Abdullahi in\r\nKordofân, far from Khartûm, he had heard of a certain Smain, who taught\r\nthe dervishes how to fire from the cannons captured from the Egyptians,\r\nand afterwards became a slave hunter. Nur suggested to Idris the\r\nfollowing method of finding him:\r\n\r\n\"At noon, when you hear the sounds of the umbajas,* [* Umbajas--big\r\ntrumpets of ivory tusk.] be with the children at the place of prayer,\r\nto which the Mahdi repairs daily to edify the faithful with an example\r\nof piety and to fortify them in the faith. There besides the sacred\r\nperson of the Mahdi you will behold all the 'Nobles' and also the three\r\ncaliphs as well as the pashas and emirs; among the emirs you may find\r\nSmain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what am I to do and where shall I stay until the time of the\r\nafternoon prayer?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will remain with my soldiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you, Nur el-Tadhil, leave us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going for orders to the caliph Abdullahi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he the greatest of caliphs? I come from far and though the names of\r\nthe commanders have reached my ears, nevertheless you may instruct me\r\nmore definitely about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Abdullahi my commander is the Mahdi's sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"May Allah make him the son of victory.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time the boat floated in silence. There could be heard only\r\nthe grating of the oars on the boat's edges and once in a while a\r\nsplash of water by a crocodile struck in the tail. Many of these ugly\r\nreptiles had swam down from the south to Khartûm, where they found an\r\nabundance of food, for the river teemed with corpses, not only of the\r\npeople who were slaughtered after the capture of the city, but also of\r\nthose who died of diseases which raged amidst the Mahdists and\r\nparticularly among the slaves. The commands of the caliphs prohibited,\r\nindeed, \"the contamination of the water,\" but they were not heeded, and\r\nthe bodies which the crocodiles did not devour floated with the water,\r\nface downward, to the Sixth Cataract and even as far as Beber.\r\n\r\nBut Idris thought of something else, and after a while said:\r\n\r\n\"This morning we did not get anything to eat. I do not know whether we\r\ncan hold out from hunger until the hour of prayer, and who will feed us\r\nlater?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not a slave,\" replied Tadhil, \"and can go to the market-place\r\nwhere merchants display their supplies. There you can obtain dried meat\r\nand sometimes dochnu (millet), but for a high price; as I told you,\r\nfamine reigns in Omdurmân.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in the meantime wicked people will seize and kill those children.\"\r\n\r\n\"The soldiers will protect them, and if you give money to any one of\r\nthem, he will willingly go for provisions.\"\r\n\r\nThis advice did not please Idris who had a greater desire to take money\r\nthan to give it to any one, but before he was able to make reply the\r\nboat touched the bank.\r\n\r\nTo the children Omdurmân appeared different from Khartûm. In the latter\r\nplace there were houses of several stories built of brick and stone;\r\nthere was a \"mudirya,\" that is, a Governor's palace in which the heroic\r\nGordon had perished; there were a church, a hospital, missionary\r\nbuildings, an arsenal, great barracks for the troops and a large number\r\nof greater and smaller gardens with magnificent tropical plants.\r\nOmdurmân, on the other hand, seemed rather a great encampment of\r\nsavages. The fort which stood on the northern side of the settlement\r\nhad been razed by command of Gordon. As a whole, as far as the eye\r\ncould reach the city consisted of circular conical huts of dochnu\r\nstraw. Narrow, thorny little fences separated these huts from each\r\nother and from the streets. Here and there could be seen tents,\r\nevidently captured from the Egyptians. Elsewhere a few palm mats under\r\na piece of dirty linen stretched upon bamboo constituted the entire\r\nresidence. The population sought shelter under the roofs during rain or\r\nexceptional heat; for the rest they passed their time, built fires,\r\ncooked food, lived, and died out-of-doors. So the streets were so\r\ncrowded that in places the detachment with difficulty forced its way\r\nthrough the multitude. Formerly Omdurmân was a wretched village; at\r\npresent, counting the ives, over two hundred thousand people were\r\nhuddled in it. Even the Mahdi and his caliphs were perturbed by this\r\nvast concourse, which was threatened with famine and disease. They\r\ncontinually despatched to the north expeditions to subjugate localities\r\nand cities, loyal yet to the Egyptian Government.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the white children here also resounded unfriendly\r\ncries, but at least the rabble did not threaten with death. It may be\r\nthat they did not dare to, being so close to the prophet's side, and\r\nperhaps because they were more accustomed to the sight of prisoners who\r\nwere all transported to Omdurmân immediately after the capture of\r\nKhartûm. Stas and Nell, however, saw hell on earth. They saw Europeans\r\nand Egyptians lashed with courbashes until they bled; hungry, thirsty,\r\nbending under burdens which they were commanded to carry or under\r\nbuckets of water. They saw European women and children, who were reared\r\nin affluence, at present begging for a handful of durra or a shred of\r\nmeat; covered with rags, emaciated, resembling specters, with faces\r\nswarthy from want, on which dismay and despair had settled, and with a\r\nbewildered stare. They saw how the savages burst into laughter at the\r\nsight of these unfortunates; how they pushed and beat them. On all the\r\nstreets and alleyways there were not lacking sights from which the eyes\r\nturned away with horror and aversion. In Omdurmân, dysentery and\r\ntyphoid fever, and, above all, small-pox raged in a virulent form. The\r\nsick, covered with sores, lay at the entrances of the hovels, infecting\r\nthe air. The prisoners carried, wrapped in linen, the bodies of the\r\nnewly dead to bury them in the sand beyond the city, where the real\r\ncharge of the funeral was assumed by hyenas. Above the city hovered\r\nflocks of vultures from whose wings fell melancholy shadows upon the\r\nilluminated sand. Stas, witnessing all this, thought that the best for\r\nhim and Nell would be to die as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in this sea of human wretchedness and malice there\r\nbloomed at times compassion, as a pale flower blooms in a putrid marsh.\r\nIn Omdurmân there were a few Greeks and Copts whom the Mahdi had spared\r\nbecause he needed them. These not only walked about freely, but engaged\r\nin trade and various affairs, and some, especially those who pretended\r\nto change their faith, were even officers of the Mahdi, and this gave\r\nthem considerable importance among the wild dervishes. One of these\r\nGreeks stopped the detachment and began to question the children as to\r\nhow they happened to be there. Learning with amazement that they had\r\njust arrived, and that they had been kidnapped from far-away Fayûm, he\r\npromised to speak about them to the Mahdi and to inquire about them in\r\nthe future. In the meantime he nodded his head compassionately at Nell\r\nand gave to each a few handfuls of dried wild figs and a silver dollar\r\nwith an image of Maria Theresa. After which he admonished the soldiers\r\nnot to dare to do any harm to the little girl, and he left, repeating\r\nin English: \"Poor little bird!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough tortuous little streets they finally arrived at the\r\nmarket-place which was situated in the center of the city. On the way\r\nthey saw many men with a hand or foot cut off. They were thieves or\r\ntransgressors who had concealed booty. The punishment meted by the\r\ncaliphs for disobedience or violation of the laws promulgated by the\r\nprophet was horrible, and even for a trivial offense, such as smoking\r\ntobacco, the delinquent was whipped with courbashes until he bled or\r\nbecame unconscious. But the caliphs themselves observed these commands\r\nonly seemingly; at home they indulged in everything, so that the\r\npenalties fell upon the poor, who at one blow were despoiled of all\r\ntheir goods. Afterwards there remained for them nothing to do but beg;\r\nand as in Omdurmân there was a scarcity of provisions they died of\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nA large number of beggars also swarmed around the provision stalls. The\r\nfirst object, however, which attracted the attention of the children\r\nwas a human head fastened on a high bamboo set up in the center of the\r\nmarket-place. The face of this head was dried up and almost black,\r\nwhile the hair on the skull and the chin was as white as milk. One of\r\nthe soldiers explained to Idris that that was Gordon's head. Stas, when\r\nhe heard this, was seized by fathomless sorrow, indignation, and a\r\nburning desire for revenge; at the same time terror froze the blood in\r\nhis veins. Thus had perished that hero, that knight without fear and\r\nwithout reproach; a man, just and kind, who was loved even in the\r\nSudân. And the English people had not come in time to his aid, and\r\nlater retired, leaving his remains without a Christian burial, to be\r\nthus dishonored! Stas at that moment lost his faith in the English\r\npeople. Heretofore he naïvely believed that England, for an injury to\r\none of her citizens, was always ready to declare war against the whole\r\nworld. At the bottom of his soul there had lain a hope that in behalf\r\nof Rawlinson's daughter, after the unsuccessful pursuit, formidable\r\nEnglish hosts would be set in motion even as far as Khartûm and\r\nfarther. Now he became convinced that Khartûm and that whole region was\r\nin the hands of the Mahdi, and that the Egyptian Government and England\r\nwere thinking rather of preserving Egypt from further conquests than of\r\ndelivering the European prisoners from captivity.\r\n\r\nHe understood that he and Nell had fallen into an abyss from which\r\nthere was no escape, and these thoughts, linked with the horrors which\r\nhe witnessed on the streets of Omdurmân, disheartened him completely.\r\nHis customary energy gave way to total passive submission to fate and a\r\ndread of the future. In the meantime he began aimlessly to gaze about\r\nthe market-place and at the stalls at which Idris was bargaining for\r\nprovisions. The hucksters, mainly Sudânese women and negresses, sold\r\njubhas here, that is, white linen gowns, pieced together with many\r\ncolored patches, acacia gum, hollow gourds, glass beads, sulphur and\r\nall kinds of mats. There were a few stalls with provisions and around\r\nall of them the throng pressed. The Mahdists bought at high prices\r\nprincipally dried strips of meat of domestic animals; likewise of\r\nbuffaloes, antelopes and giraffes. Dates, figs, manioc, and durra were\r\ntotally lacking. They sold here and there water and honey of wild bees,\r\nand grains of dochnu soaked in a decoction of tamarind fruit. Idris\r\nfell into despair, for it appeared that in view of the prevailing\r\nmarket-prices he would soon exhaust all the money he had received from\r\nFatma Smain for living expenses and afterwards would, in all\r\nprobability, have to beg. His only hope now was in Smain, and strangely\r\nenough Stas also relied solely upon Smain's assistance.\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of an hour Nur el-Tadhil returned from the caliph\r\nAbdullahi. Evidently he had met with some kind of disagreeable mishap\r\nthere, for he returned in a bad humor. So when Idris asked him if he\r\nhad learned anything about Smain, he replied testily:\r\n\r\n\"Fool, do you think that the caliph and I have nothing better to do\r\nthan to seek Smain for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are you going to do with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do what you please. I gave you a night's lodging in my house and a few\r\nwords of good advice, and now I do not want to know anything more about\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is well, but where shall I find shelter?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all the same to me.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this he took the soldiers and went away. With great difficulty\r\nIdris prevailed upon him to send to the market-place the camels and the\r\nrest of the caravan, including those Arabs who had joined it between\r\nAssuan and Wâdi Haifa. These people did not come until the afternoon,\r\nand it appeared that none of them knew what they were going to do. The\r\ntwo Bedouins began to quarrel with Idris and Gebhr, claiming that they\r\nhad promised them an entirely different reception and that they had\r\ncheated them. After a long dispute and much deliberation they finally\r\ndecided to erect at the outskirts of the city huts of dochnu boughs and\r\nreeds as shelter during the night, and for the rest to depend upon the\r\nwill of providence, and wait.\r\n\r\nAfter the erection of the huts, which employment does not require much\r\ntime from Sudânese and negroes, all, excepting Chamis, who was to\r\nprepare the supper, repaired to the place of public prayer. It was easy\r\nfor them to find it, as the swarm of all Omdurmân was bound thither.\r\nThe place was spacious, encircled partly by a thorny fence and partly\r\nby a clay enclosure which was being built. In the center stood a wooden\r\nplatform. The prophet ascended it whenever he desired to instruct the\r\npeople. In front of the platform were spread upon the ground sheep\r\nhides for the Mahdi, the caliphs, and eminent sheiks. Planted at the\r\nsides were the flags of emirs, which fluttered in the air, displaying\r\nall colors and looking like great flowers. The four sides were\r\nsurrounded by the compact ranks of dervishes. Around could be seen a\r\nbold, numberless forest of spears, with which almost all the warriors\r\nwere armed.\r\n\r\nIt was real good fortune for Idris and Gebhr, and for the other members\r\nof the caravan, that they were taken for a retinue of one of the emirs.\r\nFor that reason they could press forward to the first rows of the\r\nassembled throng. The arrival of the Mahdi was announced by the\r\nbeautiful and solemn notes of umbajas, but when he appeared there\r\nresounded the shrill notes of fifes, the beating of drums, the rattle\r\nof stones shaken in empty gourds, and whistling on elephants' teeth,\r\nall of which combined created an infernal din. The swarm was swept by\r\nan indescribable fervor. Some threw themselves on their knees; others\r\nshouted with all their strength:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Messenger of God!\" \"Oh! Victorious!\" \"Oh! Merciful!\" \"Oh!\r\nGracious!\" This continued until the Mahdi entered the pulpit. Then a\r\ndead stillness fell while he raised his hands, placed his big fingers\r\nto his ears, and for some time prayed.\r\n\r\nThe children did not stand far away, and could see him well. He was a\r\nmiddle-aged man, prodigiously obese as though bloated, and almost\r\nblack. Stas, who had an unusually keen sight, perceived that his face\r\nwas tattooed. In one ear he wore a big ivory ring. He was dressed in a\r\nwhite jubha and had a white cap on his head. His feet were bare, as on\r\nmounting the platform he shook off red half-boots and left them on the\r\nsheep's hide on which he was afterwards to pray. There was not the\r\nleast luxury in his clothing. Only at times the wind carried a strong\r\nsandal* [* From sandal wood, from which in the East a fragrant oil is\r\nderived.] scent which the faithful present inhaled eagerly through\r\ntheir nostrils; at the same time they rolled their eyes from joy. On\r\nthe whole Stas had pictured differently this terrible prophet,\r\nplunderer, and murderer of so many thousand people, and looking now at\r\nthe fat face with its mild look, with eyes suffused with tears, and\r\nwith a smile, as though grown to those lips, he could not overcome his\r\nastonishment. He thought that such a man ought to bear on his shoulders\r\nthe head of a hyena or a crocodile, and instead he saw before him a\r\nchubby-faced gourd, resembling drawings of a full moon.\r\n\r\nBut the prophet began his instruction. His deep and resonant voice\r\ncould be heard perfectly all over the place, so that his words reached\r\nthe ears of all the faithful. He first spoke of the punishments which\r\nGod meted out to those who disobey the commands of the Mahdi, and hide\r\nbooty, get intoxicated upon merissa, spare the enemy in battles, and\r\nsmoke tobacco. On account of these crimes Allah sends upon the sinners\r\nfamine and that disease which changes the face into a honey-comb\r\n(small-pox). Temporal life is like a leaky leather bottle. Riches and\r\npleasure are absorbed in the sand which buries the dead. Only faith is\r\nlike a cow which gives sweet milk. But paradise will open only for the\r\nvictorious. Whoever vanquishes the enemy wins for himself salvation.\r\nWhoever dies for the faith will rise from the dead for eternity. Happy,\r\na hundredfold more happy are those who already have fallen.\r\n\r\n\"We want to die for the faith!\" answered the swarm in one tumultuous\r\nshout.\r\n\r\nAnd for a while an infernal uproar again prevailed. The umbajas and\r\ndrums sounded. The warriors struck sword against sword, spear against\r\nspear. The martial ardor spread like a flame. Some cried: \"The faith is\r\nvictorious!\" Others: \"To paradise through death!\" Stas now understood\r\nwhy the Egyptian army could not cope with this wild host.\r\n\r\nWhen the hubbub had somewhat subsided, the prophet resumed his address.\r\nHe told them of his visions and of the mission which he had received\r\nfrom God. Allah commanded him to purify the faith and spread it over\r\nthe entire world. Whoever does not acknowledge him as the Mahdi, the\r\nRedeemer, is condemned to damnation. The end of the world is already\r\nnear, but before that time it is the duty of the faithful to conquer\r\nEgypt, Mecca, and all those regions beyond the seas where the gentiles\r\ndwell. Such is the divine will which nothing can change. A great deal\r\nof blood will flow yet; many warriors will not return to their wives\r\nand children under their tents, but the happiness of those who fall no\r\nhuman tongue can describe.\r\n\r\nAfter which he stretched out his arms towards the assembled throng and\r\nconcluded thus:\r\n\r\n\"Therefore I, the Redeemer and servant of God, bless this holy war and\r\nyou warriors. I bless your toils, wounds, death; I bless victory, and\r\nweep over you like a father who has conceived an affection for you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he burst into a flood of tears. When he descended from the pulpit a\r\nroar and a clamor resounded. Weeping became general. Below, the two\r\ncaliphs Abdullahi and Ali Uled Helu took the prophet under the arms and\r\nescorted him to the sheep hide on which he knelt. During this brief\r\nmoment Idris asked Stas feverishly whether Smain was not among the\r\nemirs.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" replied the boy, who vainly sought the familiar face with his\r\neyes. \"I do not see him anywhere. Perhaps he fell at the capture of\r\nKhartûm.\"\r\n\r\nThe prayers lasted long. During these the Mahdi threw his arms and legs\r\nabout like a buffoon or raised his eyes in rapture, repeating \"Lo! It\r\nis he!\" \"Lo! It is he!\" and the sun began to decline towards the west,\r\nwhen he rose and left for his home. The children now could be convinced\r\nwith what reverence the dervishes surrounded their prophet, for crowds\r\neagerly followed him and scratched up the places which his feet\r\ntouched. They even quarreled and came to blows for they believed that\r\nsuch earth protected the healthy and healed the sick.\r\n\r\nThe place of prayer was vacated gradually. Idris himself did not know\r\nwhat to do and was about to return with the children and his whole\r\nparty to the huts and to Chamis for the night, when unexpectedly there\r\nstood before them that same Greek who in the morning had given Stas and\r\nNell each a dollar and a handful of wild figs.\r\n\r\n\"I spoke with the Mahdi about you,\" he said in Arabian, \"and the\r\nprophet desires to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to Allah and to you, sir,\" exclaimed Idris. \"Shall we find\r\nSmain at the prophet's side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smain is in Fashoda,\" answered the Greek.\r\n\r\nAfter which he addressed Stas in the English language.\r\n\r\n\"It may be that the prophet will take you under his protection as I\r\nendeavored to persuade him to do. I told him that the fame of his mercy\r\nwould then spread among all the white nations. Here terrible things are\r\ntaking place and without his protection you will perish from starvation\r\nand want of comforts, from sickness or at the hands of madmen. But you\r\nmust reconcile him and that depends upon you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, when you appear before him throw yourself upon\r\nyour knees, and if he should tender his hand, kiss it with reverence\r\nand beseech him to take you two under his wings.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Greek broke off and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Do any of these men understand English?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Idris and Gebhr understand only a few simple words and the others\r\nnot even that.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is well. So listen further, for it is necessary to anticipate\r\neverything. Now the Mahdi will in all probability ask you whether you\r\nare ready to accept his faith. Answer at once that you are and that at\r\nthe sight of him, from the first glance of the eye an unknown light of\r\ngrace flowed upon you. Remember, 'an unknown light of grace.' That will\r\nflatter him and he will enroll you among his muzalems, that is, among\r\nhis personal servants. You will then enjoy plenty and all the comforts\r\nwhich will shield you from sickness. If you should act otherwise you\r\nwould endanger yourself, that poor little creature, and even me, who\r\nwishes your good. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nStas set his teeth and did not reply, but his face was icy and his eyes\r\nflashed up sullenly. Seeing which the Greek continued thus:\r\n\r\n\"I know, my boy, that this is a disagreeable matter, but it cannot be\r\nhelped. All of those who were saved after the massacre in Khartûm\r\naccepted the Mahdi's doctrines. Only a few Catholic missionaries and\r\nnuns did not assent to it, but that is a different matter. The Koran\r\nprohibits the slaughter of priests, so though their fate is horrible,\r\nthey are not at least threatened with death. For the secular people,\r\nhowever, there was no other salvation. I repeat, they all accepted\r\nMohammedism; the Germans, Italians, Englishmen, Copts, Greeks--I\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here, though Stas had assured him that no one in that crowd\r\nunderstood English, he nevertheless lowered his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, I need not tell you that this is no denial of faith, no\r\ntreason, no apostasy. In his soul every one remained what he was and\r\nGod saw it. Before superior force it is necessary to bend, though\r\nseemingly. It is the duty of man to preserve life and it would be\r\nmadness, and even a sin, to jeopardize it--for what? For appearances,\r\nfor a few words, which at the same time you may disavow in your soul?\r\nAnd remember that you hold in your hands not only your life but the\r\nlife of your little companion which it is not permissible for you to\r\ndispose of. In truth, I can guarantee to you if ever God saves you from\r\nthese hands then you will not have anything to reproach yourself with,\r\nnor will any one find fault with you, as this is the case with all of\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nThe Greek, speaking in this manner, perhaps deceived his own\r\nconscience, but Stas' silence deceived him also for in the end he\r\nmistook it for fear. He determined therefore to give the boy courage.\r\n\r\n\"These are the houses of the Mahdi,\" he said. \"He prefers to live in\r\nthe wooden sheds of Omdurmân rather than in Khartûm, though there he\r\ncould occupy Gordon's palace. Well then, bravely! Don't lose your head!\r\nTo the question reply firmly. They prize courage here. Also do not\r\nimagine that the Mahdi will at once roar at you like a lion! No! He\r\nalways smiles, even when contemplating nothing good.\"\r\n\r\nAnd saying this he began to shout at the crowd standing in front of the\r\nhouse to make way for the prophet's \"guests.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the room, the Mahdi lay on a soft cot, surrounded by\r\nhis wives, two of whom fanned him with great ostrich feathers and the\r\nother two lightly scratched the soles of his feet. Besides his wives,\r\nthere were present only the caliph Abdullahi and the sheref caliph, as\r\nthe third, Ali Uled Helu, was despatching at that time troops to the\r\nnorth, particularly to Beber and Abu Hâmed, which already had been\r\ncaptured by the dervishes. At sight of the arrivals the prophet\r\ndismissed his wives and sat up on the cot. Idris, Gebhr, and the two\r\nBedouins fell on their faces and afterwards knelt with hands crossed on\r\ntheir breasts. The Greek beckoned to Stas to do the same, but the boy,\r\npretending not to see the gesture, only bowed and remained standing\r\nerect. His face was pale, but his eyes shone strongly and from his\r\nwhole posture and head, haughtily upraised, from his tightly compressed\r\nlips it could easily be seen that something had taken an ascendancy\r\nover him, that uncertainty and fear had passed away, that he had\r\nadopted an inflexible resolution from which he would not recede for\r\nanything. The Greek evidently understood this, as great uneasiness was\r\nreflected on his features. The Mahdi observed both children with a\r\nfleeting glance, brightened his fat face with his customary smile,\r\nafter which he first addressed Idris and Gebhr:\r\n\r\n\"You came from the distant north,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIdris struck the ground with his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, oh Mahdi! We belong to the tribe of Dongola; therefore we\r\nabandoned our homes in Fayûm in order to kneel at your blessed feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beheld you in the desert. That was a terrible journey but I sent an\r\nangel to guard and shield you from death at the hands of the infidels.\r\nYou did not see this, but he watched over you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to thee, Redeemer.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you brought those children to Smain to exchange them for his own,\r\nthat the Turks imprisoned together with Fatma in Port Said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thee we desired to serve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoever serves me serves his own salvation; therefore you have opened\r\nfor yourselves the path to paradise. Fatma is my relative. But verily I\r\nsay unto you that when we subjugate the whole of Egypt, then my\r\nrelative and her posterity will anyway regain liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And therefore do with these children whatever thou desirest--oh\r\nblessed one.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mahdi closed his eyelids, after which he opened them, smiling\r\nkindly, and nodded at Stas.\r\n\r\n\"Approach, boy.\"\r\n\r\nStas advanced a few paces with an energetic, as if soldierly, stride;\r\nhe bowed a second time after which he straightened as a chord and,\r\nlooking straight into the Mahdi's eyes, waited.\r\n\r\n\"Are you delighted that you came to me?\" the Mahdi asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, prophet. We were abducted in spite of our wills from our parents.\"\r\n\r\nThis plain answer created a certain sensation upon the ruler accustomed\r\nto flattery, and upon those present. Caliph Abdullahi frowned, the\r\nGreek gnawed his mustache, and began to wring his hands. The Mahdi,\r\nhowever, did not cease to smile.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he said, \"you are at the fountain of truth. Do you want to drink\r\nat that fountain?\"\r\n\r\nA moment of silence followed; so the Mahdi, thinking the boy did not\r\nunderstand the question, repeated it more plainly.\r\n\r\n\"Do you desire to accept my doctrines?\"\r\n\r\nTo this Stas imperceptibly made a sign of the holy cross with his hand\r\nwhich he held at his breast, as though he was about to leap from a\r\nsinking ship into a watery chaos.\r\n\r\n\"Prophet,\" he said, \"your doctrines I do not know; therefore if I\r\naccepted them, I would do it out of fear like a coward and a base man.\r\nAre you anxious that your faith should be professed by cowards and base\r\npeople?\"\r\n\r\nAnd speaking thus he looked steadfastly in the eyes of the Mahdi. It\r\nbecame so quiet that only the buzz of flies could be heard. But at the\r\nsame time something extraordinary had happened. The Mahdi became\r\nconfused, and for the nonce did not know what reply to make. The smile\r\nvanished from his face, on which was reflected perplexity and\r\ndispleasure. He stretched out his hand, took hold of the gourd, filled\r\nit with water and honey, and began to drink, but obviously only to gain\r\ntime and to conceal his confusion.\r\n\r\nAnd the brave boy, a worthy descendant of the defenders of\r\nChristianity, of the true blood of the victors at Khoczim and Vienna,\r\nstood with upraised head, awaiting his doom. On his emaciated cheeks,\r\ntanned by the desert winds, bloomed bright blushes, his eyes glittered,\r\nand his body quivered with the thrill of ardor. \"All others,\" he\r\nsoliloquized, \"accepted his doctrines, but I have denied neither my\r\nfaith nor my soul.\" And fear before what might and was to follow at\r\nthat moment was subdued in his heart, and joy and pride overflowed it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Mahdi replaced the gourd and asked:\r\n\r\n\"So, you reject my doctrines?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a Christian like my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoever closes his eyes to the voice of God,\" said the Mahdi slowly in\r\na changed voice, \"is only fuel for the flames.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the caliph Abdullahi, notorious for his ferocity and cruelty,\r\ndisplayed his white teeth like a savage animal and spoke out:\r\n\r\n\"The speech of this boy is insolent; therefore punish him, lord, or\r\npermit me to punish him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has happened!\" Stas thought.\r\n\r\nBut the Mahdi always desired that the fame of his mercy should spread\r\nnot only among the dervishes but over the whole world; therefore he\r\nthought that a too severe sentence, particularly upon a small boy,\r\nmight injure that fame.\r\n\r\nFor a while he fingered the rosary beads and meditated, and afterwards\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"No. These children were abducted for Smain; so, though I do not want\r\nto enter into any negotiations with the infidels, it is necessary to\r\nsend them to Smain. Such is my will.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be obeyed,\" answered the caliph.\r\n\r\nBut the Mahdi pointed to Idris, Gebhr, and the Bedouins and said:\r\n\r\n\"Reward these men for me, oh Abdullahi, for they made a long and\r\ndangerous journey to serve God and me.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which he nodded in sign that the audience was ended and at the\r\nsame time ordered the Greek to leave also. The latter, when they found\r\nthemselves in the darkness on the place of prayer, seized Stas' arm and\r\nbegan to shake it with anger and despair.\r\n\r\n\"Accursed! You have sealed the doom of that innocent child,\" he said,\r\npointing at Nell. \"You have ruined yourself and perhaps me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not do otherwise,\" answered Stas.\r\n\r\n\"You could not? Know that you are condemned to a journey a hundredfold\r\nworse than the first. And that is death,--do you understand? In Fashoda\r\nthe fever will kill you in the course of a week. The Mahdi knew why he\r\nsent you to Smain.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Omdurmân we also would perish.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not true! You would not have perished in the house of the\r\nMahdi, in plenty and comfort. And he was ready to take you under his\r\nwings. I know that he was. You also repaid me nicely for interceding\r\nfor you. But do what you wish, Abdullahi will despatch the camel-post\r\nto Fashoda in about a week and during that time do whatever you please!\r\nYou will not see me any more!\"\r\n\r\nSaying this he went away, but after a while returned. He, like all\r\nGreeks, was loquacious, and it was necessary for him to tell everything\r\nhe had to say. He wanted to pour upon Stas' head all the bile which had\r\naccumulated within him. He was not cruel and did not possess a bad\r\nheart; he desired, however, that the boy should understand more\r\nthoroughly the awful responsibility which he had assumed in not heeding\r\nhis advice and warnings.\r\n\r\n\"Who would have prevented you from remaining a Christian in your soul?\"\r\nhe said. \"Do you think that I am not one? But I am not a fool. You on\r\nthe other hand preferred to make a parade of your false heroism.\r\nHeretofore I have rendered great services to the white prisoners, but\r\nnow I shall not be able to aid them for the Mahdi has become incensed\r\nat me. All will perish. And your little companion in misfortune also:\r\nyou have killed her! In Fashoda even adult Europeans die of the fever\r\nlike flies, and what of such a child? And if they order you to go on\r\nfoot beside the horses and camels, she will fall the first day. You did\r\nall this. Enjoy yourself now--you Christian!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he left them while they turned from the place of prayer towards the\r\nhuts. They walked long, as the city was spread over an immense space.\r\nNell, worn out by fatigue, hunger, fright, and the horrible impressions\r\nof the whole day, began to lag. Idris and Gebhr urged her to walk\r\nfaster. But after a time her limbs became entirely numb. Then Stas,\r\nwithout reflection, took her in his arms and carried her. On the way he\r\nwanted to speak to her; he wanted to justify himself, but ideas were\r\ntorpid, as if they were dead in his mind; so he only repeated in a\r\ncircle, \"Nell! Nell! Nell!\" and he clasped her to his bosom, not being\r\nable to say anything more. After a few score paces Nell fell asleep in\r\nhis arms from exhaustion; so he walked in silence amid the quiet of the\r\nslumbering little streets, interrupted only by the conversation of\r\nIdris and Gebhr, whose hearts overflowed with joy. This was fortunate\r\nfor Stas, as otherwise they would have punished him for his insolent\r\nreply to the Mahdi. They were, however, so occupied with what they had\r\nseen that they could not think of anything else.\r\n\r\n\"I felt sick,\" said Idris, \"but the sight of the prophet healed me.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is like a palm in the desert, and like cool water on a scorching\r\nday, and his words are like ripe dates,\" answered Gebhr.\r\n\r\n\"Nur el-Tadhil lied when he said that he would not permit us to be\r\nadmitted to his presence. He admitted us, blessed us, and ordered\r\nAbdullahi to lavish gifts upon us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who will munificently enrich us, for the wish of the Mahdi is sacred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bismillah! May it be as you say!\" spoke out one of the Bedouins.\r\n\r\nAnd Gebhr began to dream of whole herds of camels, horned cattle, and\r\nbags full of piastres.\r\n\r\nFrom these dreams he was awakened by Idris who, pointing at Stas\r\ncarrying the sleeping girl, asked:\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do with that hornet and that fly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Smain ought to reward us for them, separately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since the prophet says that he will not permit any negotiations with\r\nthe infidels, Smain will have no interest in them.\"\r\n\r\n\"In such case I regret that they did not get into the hands of the\r\ncaliph, who would have taught that whelp what it is to bark against the\r\ntruth and the elect of the Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi is merciful,\" answered Idris.\r\n\r\nAfter which he pondered for a while and said:\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, Smain having both in his hands will be certain that\r\nneither the Turks nor the English people will kill his children and\r\nFatma.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he may reward us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Let Abdullahi's post take them to Fashoda. A weight will fall off\r\nour heads, and when Smain returns here we will demand recompense from\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say then that we will remain in Omdurmân?\"\r\n\r\n\"Allah! Have you not had enough in the journey from Fayûm to Khartûm?\r\nThe time for rest has come.\"\r\n\r\nThe huts were now not far off. Stas, however, slackened his pace for\r\nhis strength began to wane. Nell, though light, seemed heavier and\r\nheavier. The Sudânese, who were anxious to go to sleep, shouted at him\r\nto hurry and afterwards drove him on, striking him on the head with\r\ntheir fists. Gebhr even pricked him painfully in the shoulder with a\r\nknife. The boy endured all this in silence, protecting above all his\r\nlittle sister, and not until one of the Bedouins shoved him so that he\r\nalmost fell, did he say to them through his set teeth:\r\n\r\n\"We are to arrive at Fashoda alive.\"\r\n\r\nAnd these words restrained the Arabs, for they feared to violate the\r\ncommands of the Mahdi. A yet more effective restraint, however, was the\r\nfact that Idris suddenly became so dizzy that he had to lean on Gebhr's\r\narm. After an interval the dizziness passed away, but the Sudânese\r\nbecame frightened and said:\r\n\r\n\"Allah! Something ails me. Has not some sickness taken hold of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have seen the Mahdi, so you will not fall sick,\" answered Gebhr.\r\n\r\nThey finally reached the huts. Stas, hurrying with the remnants of his\r\nstrength, delivered sleeping Nell to the hands of old Dinah, who,\r\nthough unwell also, nevertheless made a comfortable bed for her little\r\nlady. The Sudânese and the Bedouins, swallowing a few strips of raw\r\nmeat, flung themselves, like logs, on the saddle-cloth. Stas was not\r\ngiven anything to eat, but old Dinah shoved into his hand a fistful of\r\nsoaked durra, a certain amount of which she had stolen from the camels.\r\nBut he was not in the mood for eating or sleeping, for the load which\r\nweighed on his shoulders was in truth too heavy. He felt that in\r\nrejecting the favor of the Mahdi, for which it was necessary to pay\r\nwith denial of faith and soul, he had acted as he should have done; he\r\nfelt that his father would have been proud and happy at his conduct,\r\nbut at the same time he thought that he had caused the destruction of\r\nNell, his companion in misfortune, his little beloved sister, for whom\r\nhe would willingly have sacrificed his last drop of blood.\r\n\r\nSo when all had fallen asleep he burst into a flood of tears, and,\r\nlying on a piece of saddle-cloth, he wept long, like the child which,\r\nafter all, he still was.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visit to the Mahdi and the interview with him evidently did not\r\nheal Idris, as during the night he grew worse and in the morning became\r\nunconscious. Chamis, Gebhr, and the two Bedouins were summoned to the\r\ncaliph who detained them some hours and praised their courage. But they\r\nreturned in the worst humor and with rage in their souls for they had\r\nexpected the Lord knows what rewards, and in the meantime Abdullahi\r\ngave each one an Egyptian pound* [*  About five dollars.--_Translator's\r\nnote_.] and a horse.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouins began a quarrel with Gebhr which almost resulted in a\r\nfight; in the end they announced that they would ride together with the\r\ncamel-post to Fashoda to demand payment from Smain. They were joined by\r\nChamis who expected that the patronage of Smain would be more\r\nbeneficial to him than a sojourn in Omdurmân.\r\n\r\nFor the children a week of hunger and misery began, for Gebhr did not\r\nthink of feeding them. Fortunately Stas had the two dollars with the\r\neffigy of Maria Theresa, which he got from the Greek; so he went to the\r\ncity to buy dates and rice. The Sudânese did not oppose this trip as\r\nthey knew that he could not escape from Omdurmân and that under no\r\ncircumstances would he desert the little \"bint.\" This experience did\r\nnot pass without some adventures, however, for the sight of a boy in\r\nEuropean dress buying provisions at the market-place, again attracted a\r\ncrowd of semi-savage dervishes, who received him with laughter and\r\nyells. Fortunately many knew that he had been at the Mahdi's the\r\nprevious day, and they restrained those who wanted to assault him. Only\r\nchildren threw sand and stones at him, but he paid no attention to them.\r\n\r\nAt the market-place the prices were too high. Stas could not obtain any\r\ndates at all and a considerable part of the rice was taken away from\r\nhim by Gebhr for \"his sick brother.\" The boy resisted with all his\r\nstrength, in consequence of which a scuffle and fight ensued, in which\r\nthe really weaker one came out with numerous contusions and bruises. In\r\naddition the cruelty of Chamis became manifest. The latter evinced an\r\nattachment for Saba and fed him with raw meat; on the other hand, at\r\nthe distress of the children, whom he knew of old and who had always\r\nbeen kind to him, he looked with the utmost indifference, and when Stas\r\naddressed him with a request that he should at least give Nell a morsel\r\nof food, he replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n\"Go and beg.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it finally came to the pass that Stas during the following days,\r\ndesiring to save Nell from death by starvation, begged. Nor was he\r\nalways unsuccessful. At times some former soldier or officer of the\r\nEgyptian Khedive gave him a few piastres or a few dried figs, and\r\npromised to aid him on the following day. Once he happened to meet a\r\nmissionary and a sister of charity, who, hearing his story, bemoaned\r\nthe fate of both children, and though they themselves were wasted with\r\nhunger, shared with him everything which they had. They also promised\r\nto visit them in the huts and did actually come the next day in the\r\nhope that they might succeed in taking the children with them until the\r\ntime of the departure of the post. But Gebhr with Chamis drove them\r\naway with courbashes. On the following day Stas met them again and\r\nreceived from them a little measure of rice together with two quinine\r\npowders, which the missionary instructed him to save most carefully in\r\nthe expectation that in Fashoda fever inevitably awaited both.\r\n\r\n\"You will ride now,\" he said, \"alongside of the dense floating masses\r\nin the White Nile or the so-called 'sudds'. The river, not being able\r\nto flow freely across the barriers composed of vegetation and weeds\r\nwhich the current of the water carries and deposits in the more shallow\r\nplaces, forms there extensive and infectious swamps, amid which the\r\nfever does not spare even the negroes. Beware particularly of sleeping\r\non the bare ground without a fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"We already wish to die,\" answered Stas, almost with a moan.\r\n\r\nAt this the missionary raised his haggard face and for a while prayed;\r\nafter which he made the sign of the cross over the boy and said:\r\n\r\n\"Trust in God. You did not deny Him; so His mercy and care will be over\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nStas tried not only to beg, but to work. A certain day, seeing a crowd\r\nof men laboring at the place of prayer, he joined them, and began to\r\ncarry clay for the palisade with which the place was to be surrounded.\r\nThey jeered at and jostled him, but at evening the old sheik, who\r\nsuperintended the work, gave him twelve dates. Stas was immensely\r\noverjoyed at this compensation, for dates with rice formed the only\r\nwholesome nourishment for Nell and became more and more difficult to\r\nobtain in Omdurmân.\r\n\r\nSo he brought them with pride to his little sister, to whom he gave\r\neverything which he could secure; he sustained himself for a week\r\nalmost exclusively upon durra taken from the camels. Nell was greatly\r\ndelighted at the sight of her favorite fruit but wanted him to share it\r\nwith her. So, tiptoeing, she placed her hands on his shoulders, and\r\nturning up her head, began to gaze into his eyes and plead:\r\n\r\n\"Stas! Eat a half, eat--\"\r\n\r\nTo this he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I have already eaten. I have eaten. I have eaten my fill.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he smiled, but immediately began to bite his lips in order not to\r\nweep, as he really was hungry. He promised himself that the following\r\nday he would go again and earn some more; but it happened otherwise. In\r\nthe morning a muzalem from Abdullahi came with the announcement that\r\nthe camel-post was to leave at night for Fashoda, and with the caliph's\r\ncommand that Idris, Gebhr, Chamis, and the two Bedouins should prepare\r\nto go with the children. This command amazed and aroused the\r\nindignation of Gebhr; so he declared that he would not go as his\r\nbrother was sick and there was no one to attend to him, and even if he\r\nwere well, both had decided to remain in Omdurmân.\r\n\r\nBut the muzalem replied:\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi has only one will, and Abdullahi, his caliph and my master,\r\nnever alters commands. Your brother can be attended by a slave, while\r\nyou will depart for Fashoda.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall go and inform him that I will not depart.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the caliph are admitted only those whom he himself desires to see.\r\nAnd if you without permission, and through violence, should force\r\nyourself into his presence, I will lead you to the gallows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allah akbar! Then tell me plainly that I am a slave!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent and obey orders!\" answered the muzalem.\r\n\r\nThe Sudânese had seen in Omdurmân gallows breaking under the weight of\r\nhanging men. By order of the ferocious Abdullahi these gallows were\r\ndaily decorated with new bodies. Gebhr became terror-stricken. That\r\nwhich the muzalem told him, that the Mahdi commanded but once, was\r\nreiterated by all the dervishes. There was therefore no help; it was\r\nnecessary to ride.\r\n\r\n\"I shall see Idris no more!\" thought Gebhr.\r\n\r\nIn his tigerish heart was concealed a sort of attachment for his older\r\nbrother, so that at the thought that he would have to leave him in\r\nsickness he was seized by despair. In vain did Chamis and the Bedouins\r\nrepresent to him that they might fare better in Fashoda than in\r\nOmdurmân, and that Smain in all probability would reward them more\r\nbountifully than the caliph had done. No words could assuage Gebhr's\r\ngrief and rage, and the rage rebounded mainly upon Stas.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a day of martyrdom for the boy. He was not permitted to\r\ngo to the market-place, so he could not earn anything or beg, and was\r\ncompelled to work as a slave at the pack-saddles, which were being\r\nprepared for the journey. This became a more difficult matter as from\r\nhunger and torture he weakened very much. He was certain that he would\r\ndie on the road; if not under Gebhr's courbash, then from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nFortunately the Greek, who had a good heart, came in at the evening to\r\nvisit the children and to bid them farewell, and at the same time to\r\nprovide for them on the way. He brought a few quinine powders, and\r\nbesides these a few glass beads and a little food. Finally, learning of\r\nIdris' sickness, he turned to Gebhr, Chamis, and the Bedouins.\r\n\r\n\"Know this,\" he said. \"I come here by the Mahdi's command.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when they heard this they smote with their foreheads and he\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"You are to feed the children on the way and treat them well. They are\r\nto render a report of your behavior to Smain. Smain shall write of this\r\nto the prophet. If any complaint against you comes here, the next post\r\nwill carry a death sentence for you.\"\r\n\r\nA new bow was the only reply to these words; in addition Gebhr and\r\nChamis had the miens of dogs on which muzzles are placed.\r\n\r\nThe Greek then ordered them away, after which he thus spoke to the\r\nchildren in English:\r\n\r\n\"I fabricated all this, for the Mahdi did not issue any new orders. But\r\nas he said that you were to go to Fashoda, it is necessary that you\r\nshould reach there alive. I also reckoned upon this, that none of them\r\nwill see either the Mahdi or the caliph before their departure.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which to Stas:\r\n\r\n\"I took umbrage at you, boy, and feel it yet. Do you know that you\r\nalmost ruined me? The Mahdi was offended at me, and to secure his\r\nforgiveness I was forced to surrender to Abdullahi a considerable\r\nportion of my estate, and besides, I do not know for how long a time I\r\nhave saved myself. In any case I shall not be able to assist the\r\ncaptives as I have heretofore done. But I felt sorry for you,\r\nparticularly for her (and here he pointed at Nell). I have a daughter\r\nof the same age, whom I love more than my own life, and for her sake I\r\nhave done everything which I have done. Christ will judge me for\r\nthis--Up to this time she wears under her dress, on her breast, a\r\nsilver cross.--Her name is the same as yours, little one. Were it not\r\nfor her, I would have preferred to die rather than to live in this\r\nhell.\"\r\n\r\nHe was deeply moved. For a while he was silent, after which he rubbed\r\nhis forehead with his hand and began to speak of something else.\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi sends you to Fashoda with the idea that there you will die.\r\nIn this manner he will revenge himself upon you for your stubbornness,\r\nboy, which touched him deeply, and he will not lose his fame for\r\n'mercy.' He always acts thus. But who knows who is destined to die\r\nfirst? Abdullahi suggested to him the idea that he should order the\r\ndogs who kidnapped you, to go with you. He rewarded them miserably, and\r\nnow he fears that they may publish it. Besides, they both preferred\r\nthat the people should not be told that there are still in Egypt\r\ntroops, cannons, money, and Englishmen.--It will be a hard road and\r\ndistant. You will go into a country desolate and unhealthy. So guard,\r\nas the eye in the head, those powders which I gave to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, order Gebhr once more not to dare to starve or hit Nell,\" said\r\nStas.\r\n\r\n\"Do not fear. I commended you to the old sheik who has charge of the\r\npost. He is an old acquaintance of mine. I gave him a watch and with\r\nthat I gained his protection for you.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he began to bid them farewell. Taking Nell in his arms, he\r\npressed her to his bosom and repeated:\r\n\r\n\"May God bless you, my child.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the sun descended and the night became starry. In the\r\ndusk resounded the snorting of horses and the groans of the heavily\r\nloaded camels.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old sheik Hatim faithfully kept his promise given to the Greek and\r\nwatched over the children with great solicitude. The journey up the\r\nWhite Nile was difficult. They rode through Keteineh, Ed-Dueim, and\r\nKawa; afterwards they passed Abba, a woody Nile island, on which before\r\nthe war the Mahdi dwelt, in a hollow tree as a dervish hermit. The\r\ncaravan often was compelled to make a detour around extensive floating\r\nmasses overgrown with pyrus, or so-called \"sudds,\" from which the\r\nbreeze brought the poisoned odor of decomposed leaves carried by the\r\ncurrent of water. English engineers had previously cut through these\r\nbarriers, and formerly steamboats could ascend from Khartûm to Fashoda\r\nand farther. At present the river was blocked again and, being unable\r\nto run freely, overflowed on both sides. The right and left banks of\r\nthis region were covered by a high jungle amid which stood hillocks of\r\ntermites and solitary gigantic trees; here and there the forest reached\r\nthe river. In dry places grew groves of acacias. During the first week\r\nthey saw Arabian settlements and towns composed of houses with strange\r\nconical roofs made of dochnu straw, but beyond Abba, from the\r\nsettlement of Gôz Abu Guma they rode in the country of the blacks. It\r\nwas nearly desolate, for the dervishes had almost totally carried away\r\nthe local negro population and sold it in the markets of Khartûm,\r\nOmdurmân, Fasher, Dar, El-Obeid, and other cities in the Sudân, Darfur,\r\nand Kordofân. Those inhabitants who succeeded in escaping slavery in\r\nthickets in the forests were exterminated by starvation and small-pox,\r\nwhich raged with unusual virulence along the White and Blue Niles. The\r\ndervishes themselves said that whole nations had died of it. The former\r\nplantations of sorghum, manioc, and bananas were covered by a jungle.\r\nOnly wild beasts, not pursued by any one, multiplied plentifully.\r\nSometimes before the evening twilight the children saw from a distance\r\ngreat herds of elephants, resembling movable rocks, walking with slow\r\ntread to watering places known only to themselves. At the sight of them\r\nHatim, a former ivory dealer, smacked his lips, sighed, and spoke thus\r\nto Stas in confidence:\r\n\r\n\"Mashallah! How much wealth there is here! But now it is not worth\r\nwhile to hunt, for the Mahdi has prohibited Egyptian traders from\r\ncoming to Khartûm, and there is no one to sell the tusks to, unless to\r\nthe emirs for umbajas.\"\r\n\r\nThey met also giraffes, which, seeing the caravan, escaped hurriedly\r\nwith heavy ambling pace, swinging their long necks as if they were\r\nlame. Beyond Gôz Abu Guma appeared, more and more frequently, buffaloes\r\nand whole herds of antelopes. The people of the caravan when they\r\nlacked fresh meat hunted for them, but almost always in vain, for the\r\nwatchful and fleet animals would not allow themselves to be approached\r\nor surrounded.\r\n\r\nProvisions were generally scarce, as owing to the depopulation of the\r\nregion they could not obtain either millet or bananas, or fish, which\r\nin former times were furnished by the Shilluk and Dinka tribes who\r\nexchanged them willingly for glass beads and brass wire. Hatim,\r\nhowever, did not permit the children to die of starvation, and what is\r\nmore he kept a strict control over Gebhr; and once, when the latter at\r\nabout bed-time struck Stas while removing saddles from the camels, he\r\nordered the Sudânese to be stretched upon the ground and whipped thirty\r\ntimes on each heel with a bamboo. For two days the cruel Sudânese could\r\nwalk only on his toes and cursed the hour when he left Fayûm, and\r\nrevenged himself upon a young slave named Kali, who had been presented\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nStas at the beginning was almost pleased that he had left infected\r\nOmdurmân and that he saw a country of which he always had dreamed. His\r\nstrong constitution thus far endured perfectly the toils of the journey\r\nand the abundant food restored his energy. Several times during the\r\njourney and at the stops he whispered to his little sister that it was\r\npossible to escape even from beyond the White Nile, and that he did not\r\nat all abandon that design. But her health disquieted him. Three weeks\r\nafter the day of their departure from Omdurmân Nell had not indeed\r\nsuccumbed to the fever, but her face grew thinner and instead of being\r\ntanned it became more and more transparent, and her little hands looked\r\nas if they were moulded of wax. She did not lack care and even such\r\ncomforts as Stas and Dinah with the aid of Hatim could provide, but she\r\nlacked the salubrious desert air. The moist and torrid climate united\r\nwith the hardships of the journey more and more undermined the strength\r\nof the child.\r\n\r\nStas, beginning at Gôz Abu Guma, gave her daily a half powder of\r\nquinine and worried terribly at the thought that this remedy, which\r\ncould be obtained nowhere later, would not last him long. But it could\r\nnot be helped, for it was necessary above all things to prevent the\r\nfever. At moments despair possessed him. He deluded himself, however,\r\nwith the hope that Smain, if he desired to exchange them for his own\r\nchildren, would have to seek for them a more salubrious place than the\r\nneighborhood of Fashoda.\r\n\r\nBut misfortune seemed continually to pursue its victims. On the day\r\nbefore the arrival at Fashoda, Dinah, who while in Omdurmân felt weak,\r\nfainted suddenly at the untying of the small luggage with Nell's things\r\ntaken from Fayûm, and fell from the camel. Stas and Chamis revived her\r\nwith the greatest difficulty. She did not, however, regain\r\nconsciousness, or rather she regained it at the evening only to bid a\r\ntearful farewell to her beloved little lady, and to die. After her\r\ndeath Gebhr insisted upon cutting off her ears in order to show them to\r\nSmain as proof that she died during the journey, and to demand of him a\r\nseparate payment for her abduction. This was done with a slave who\r\nexpired during the journey. But Hatim, at the entreaties of Stas and\r\nNell, would not consent to this; so they buried her decently and her\r\nmound was safeguarded against hyenas with the assistance of stones and\r\nthorns. The children felt yet more lonely for they realized that in her\r\nthey had lost the only near and devoted soul. This was a terrible blow,\r\nparticularly for Nell, so Stas endeavored to comfort her throughout the\r\nwhole night and the following day.\r\n\r\nThe sixth week of the journey arrived. On the next day at noon the\r\ncaravan reached Fashoda, but they found only a pyre. The Mahdists\r\nbivouacked under the bare heaven or in huts hurriedly built of grass\r\nand boughs. Three days previously the settlement had been burnt down.\r\nThere remained only the clay walls of the round hovels, blackened with\r\nsmoke, and, standing close by the water, a great wooden shed, which\r\nduring the Egyptian times served as a storage-place for ivory; in it at\r\npresent lived the commander of the dervishes, Emir Seki Tamala. He was\r\na distinguished personage among the Mahdists, a secret enemy of\r\nAbdullahi, but on the other hand a personal friend of Hatim. He\r\nreceived the old sheik and the children hospitably, but immediately at\r\nthe introduction told them unfavorable news.\r\n\r\nSmain was not in Fashoda. Two days before he had gone southeast from\r\nthe Nile on an expedition for slaves, and it was not known when he\r\nwould return, as the nearer localities were so depopulated that it was\r\nnecessary to seek for human chattels very far. Near Fashoda, indeed,\r\nlay Abyssinia, with which the dervishes likewise waged war. But Smain\r\nhaving only three hundred men did not dare to cross its borders,\r\nguarded vigilantly, at present, by King John's warlike inhabitants and\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nIn view of this Seki Tamala and Hatim began to deliberate as to what\r\nwas to be done with the children. The consultation was held mainly at\r\nsupper, to which the emir invited Stas and Nell.\r\n\r\n\"I,\" he said to Hatim, \"must soon start with all the men upon a distant\r\nexpedition against Emin Pasha,* [* Emin Pasha, by birth a German Jew,\r\nwas after the occupation by Egypt of the region around Albert Nyanza,\r\nGovernor of the Equatorial Provinces. His headquarters were at Wadelai.\r\nThe Mahdists attacked it a number of times. He was rescued by Stanley,\r\nwho conducted him with a greater part of his troops to Bagamoyo, on the\r\nIndian Ocean.]  who is located at Lado, having steamers and troops\r\nthere. Such is the command which you, Hatim, brought me. Therefore you\r\nmust return to Omdurmân, for in Fashoda there will not remain a single\r\nliving soul. Here there is no place in which to live, there is nothing\r\nto eat, and sickness is raging. I know, indeed, that the white people\r\ndo not catch small-pox, but fever will kill those children within a\r\nmonth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was ordered to bring them to Fashoda,\" replied Hatim, \"so I brought\r\nthem, and need not trouble myself about them any more. But they were\r\nrecommended to me by my friend, the Greek Kaliopuli; for that reason I\r\nwould not want them to perish.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this will surely happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what is to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Instead of leaving them in desolate Fashoda, send them to Smain\r\ntogether with those men who brought them to Omdurmân. Smain went to the\r\nmountains, to a dry and high region where the fever does not kill the\r\npeople as on the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"How will they find Smain?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the trail of fire. He will set fire to the jungle, first, in order\r\nto drive the game to the rocky ravines in which it will be easy to\r\nsurround and slaughter it, and then in order to scare out of the\r\nthickets the heathens, who hid in them before pursuit. Smain will not\r\nbe hard to find--\"\r\n\r\n\"Will they, however, overtake him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will at times pass a week in one locality to cure meat. Even though\r\nhe rode away two or three days ago they surely will overtake him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should they chase after him? He will return to Fashoda anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. If the slave-hunt is successful, he will take the slaves to the\r\ncities to sell them--\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember that both of us must leave Fashoda. The children, even though\r\nthe fever does not kill them, will die of starvation.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the prophet! That is true.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there really remained nothing else to do but to despatch the\r\nchildren upon a new wandering life. Hatim, who appeared to be a very\r\ngood man, was only troubled about this: whether Gebhr, with whose cruel\r\ndisposition he had become acquainted during the journey, would not\r\ntreat them too harshly. But the stern Seki Tamala, who aroused fear\r\neven in his own soldiers, commanded the Sudânese to be summoned, and\r\nannounced to him that he was to convey the children alive and in good\r\nhealth to Smain, and at the same time to treat them kindly, as\r\notherwise he would be hung. The good Hatim entreated the emir to\r\npresent to little Nell a female slave, who would serve her and take\r\ncare of her during the journey and in Smain's camp. Nell was delighted\r\ngreatly with this gift as it appeared that the slave was a young Dinka\r\ngirl with pleasant features and a sweet facial expression.\r\n\r\nStas knew that Fashoda was death, so he did not at all beg Hatim that\r\nhe should not send them upon a new journey, the third in rotation. In\r\nhis soul, he thought also that riding in an easterly and southerly\r\ndirection, he must approach the Abyssinian boundaries and that he might\r\nescape. He had a hope that upon the dry tableland Nell would be\r\nsafeguarded against the fever, and for these reasons he willingly and\r\nzealously entered into the preparation for the journey.\r\n\r\nGebhr, Chamis, and the two Bedouins also were not opposed to the\r\nexpedition, reckoning that at Smain's side they would succeed in\r\ncapturing a considerable number of slaves, and afterwards sell them\r\nprofitably in the markets. They knew that slave-dealers in time amass\r\ngreat fortunes; in any case they preferred to ride rather than to\r\nremain at that place under the immediate control of Hatim and Seki\r\nTamala.\r\n\r\nThe preparations, however, consumed considerable time, particularly as\r\nthe children had to recuperate. The camels were unavailable now for\r\nthis journey, so the Arabs, and Stas and Nell were to ride on\r\nhorseback. Kali, Gebhr's slave, and Nell's maid, called Mea upon Stas'\r\nsuggestion, were to go on foot beside the horses. Hatim also procured a\r\ndonkey to carry a tent intended for the little girl and provisions for\r\nthree days for the children. More Seki Tamala could not give them. For\r\nNell, something in the nature of a ladies' saddle, made of\r\nsaddle-cloth, palm, and bamboo mats was constructed.\r\n\r\nThe children passed three days in Fashoda to rest, but the countless\r\nnumber of mosquitoes above the river made their stay unendurable.\r\nDuring the daytime appeared swarms of big blue flies, which did not\r\nindeed bite, but were so vexing that they crept into the ears, filled\r\nthe eyes, and fell even into the mouths. Stas had heard while in Port\r\nSaid that the mosquitoes and flies spread fever and an infection of the\r\ninflammation of the eyes. Finally he himself entreated Seki Tamala to\r\nhurry the expedition, particularly as the rainy spring season was\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Stas, why are we riding and speeding and have not yet reached Smain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. He undoubtedly is moving rapidly ahead, in order to\r\nreach as quickly as possible the region in which he can catch negroes.\r\nAre you anxious that we should join his detachment?\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl nodded her pale-yellow little head in sign that she was\r\nvery much concerned about it.\r\n\r\n\"Why should you be so anxious?\" asked Stas.\r\n\r\n\"Because perhaps Gebhr will not dare in Smain's company to beat that\r\npoor Kali so cruelly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smain probably is no better. They all have no mercy for their slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so?\"\r\n\r\nAnd two little tears coursed over her emaciated cheeks.\r\n\r\nIt was the ninth day of the journey. Gebhr, who was now the leader of\r\nthe caravan, in the beginning easily discovered traces of Smain's\r\nmarch. His way was indicated by a trail of burnt jungle and camping\r\ngrounds strewn with picked bones and various remnants. But after the\r\nlapse of five days they came upon a vast expanse of burnt steppe, on\r\nwhich the wind had carried the fire in all directions. The trails\r\nbecame deceptive and confusing, as, apparently, Smain had divided his\r\ndetachment into ten or more small divisions, in order to facilitate the\r\nsurrounding of the game and the capture of provisions. Gebhr did not\r\nknow in which direction to go, and often it happened that the caravan,\r\nafter moving long in a circle, returned to the same place from which it\r\nstarted. Afterwards they chanced upon forests, and after passing\r\nthrough them they entered upon a rocky country where the ground was\r\ncovered by smooth rocks or small stones, scattered over the immense\r\nexpanse so thickly that the children were reminded of city pavements.\r\nThe vegetation there was scant. Only here and there, in the crannies of\r\nrocks, grew euphorbias, mimosas, and thorny and scrubby plants and,\r\nmore infrequently yet, a slender, light green tree, which Kali in the\r\nKiswahili language called \"m'ti\" and with the leaves of which the\r\nhorses were fed. In this locality little rivers and streams were\r\nlacking, but fortunately from time to time the rain began to fall, so\r\nthey found water in the hollows and excavations of the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe game was driven away by Smain's detachment and the caravan would\r\nhave died of starvation, were it not for a multitude of guinea-fowls\r\nwhich every little while started from under the horses' legs, and at\r\nevening encumbered the trees so thickly that it was sufficient to shoot\r\nin their direction to cause a few to fall to the ground. In addition\r\nthey were not timid and permitted a close approach, and they rose so\r\nheavily and indolently that Saba, rushing ahead of the caravan, seized\r\nand choked some of them almost every day.\r\n\r\nChamis killed about a score of them daily with an old shotgun which he\r\nhad bartered from one of the dervishes serving under Hatim during the\r\ntrip from Omdurmân to Fashoda. He did not, however, have shot for more\r\nthan twenty charges and he became uneasy at the thought of what would\r\nhappen when the supply was exhausted. Indeed, notwithstanding the\r\nscaring away of the game, there appeared at times amidst the rocks\r\nherds of ariels, beautiful antelopes common in all Central Africa, but\r\nit was necessary to shoot at the ariels with the short rifle, while\r\nthey did not know how to use Stas' gun and Gebhr did not want to place\r\nit in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe Sudânese likewise began to grow uneasy at the long journey. At\r\ntimes it occurred to him to return to Fashoda, because in case he and\r\nSmain should miss each other they might stray in wild regions in which,\r\nnot to speak of starvation, they were in danger of attacks of wild\r\nanimals, and savage negroes panting for revenge for the hunt which had\r\nbeen despatched against them. But as he did not know that Seki Tamala\r\nwas preparing an expedition against Emin, for the conversation about\r\nthis was not held in his presence, he was seized with terror at the\r\nthought of appearing before the face of the puissant emir, who had\r\ncommanded him to convey the children to Smain and had given him a\r\nletter addressed to him and in addition had announced that if he did\r\nnot acquit himself properly of his duty, he would be hung. All of this\r\ntaken together filled his soul with bitterness and rage. He did not\r\ndare, however, to revenge himself for his disappointments upon Stas and\r\nNell; instead the back of poor Kali was covered with blood under the\r\ncourbash. The young slave approached his cruel master always trembling\r\nand in fear. In vain he embraced his feet and kissed his hands; in vain\r\nhe fell upon his face before him. The stony heart was not moved either\r\nby humility or by groans, and the courbash gashed the body of the\r\nunhappy boy upon the most trivial cause and often for none whatever. At\r\nnight his feet were placed in a wooden board with an opening to prevent\r\nhim from running away. During the day he walked tied with a rope\r\nfastened to a horse; this amused Chamis very much. Nell shed tears over\r\nKali's plight. Stas' heart raged and a number of times he passionately\r\ninterceded for him, but when he perceived that this inflamed Gebhr\r\nstill more, he set his teeth and remained silent.\r\n\r\nBut Kali understood that those two interceded for him, and he began to\r\nlove them deeply with his afflicted heart.\r\n\r\nFor two days they rode in a stony ravine lined with high steep rocks.\r\nFrom the stones heaped and scattered in disorder it was easy to\r\nperceive that during the rainy season the ravine was filled with water,\r\nbut at present its bed was entirely dry. On the walls, on both sides,\r\ngrew small patches of grass, a great many thorns, and here and there\r\neven a tree. Gebhr directed his way by this stony gullet because it\r\nwent continually upwards; so he thought that it would lead him to some\r\neminence from which he could descry smoke during the daytime and\r\nSmain's camp-fires at night. In some places the ravine became so narrow\r\nthat only two horses could go side by side; in other places it widened\r\ninto small, round valleys, surrounded as if by high stone walls, on\r\nwhich sat big baboons, playing with each other, barking, and displaying\r\ntheir teeth at the caravan.\r\n\r\nIt was five o'clock in the afternoon. The sun already lowered towards\r\nthe west. Gebhr thought of a resting place; he wanted only to reach\r\nsome small valley in which he could construct a zareba, that is,\r\nenclose the caravan and horses with a fence of thorny mimosa and\r\nacacias, for protection against attacks of wild animals. Saba rushed\r\nahead, barking at the baboons which at sight of him shook uneasily, and\r\nall of a sudden disappeared in the bend of the ravine. Echo repeated\r\nloudly his barking.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, he became silent and after a while he came rushing\r\nto the horses with hair bristling on his back and tail curled under\r\nhim. The Bedouins and Gebhr understood that something must have\r\nfrightened him, but staring at each other and desiring to ascertain\r\nwhat it could be, they proceeded farther.\r\n\r\nBut riding around a small bend, the horses shied and stood still in one\r\nmoment as if thunderstruck by the sight which met their eyes.\r\n\r\nOn a fair-sized rock situated in the middle of the ravine, which was\r\nquite wide at that place, lay a lion.\r\n\r\nAt most, a hundred paces separated him from them. The powerful beast,\r\nseeing the riders and horses, rose on his fore paws and began to gaze\r\nat them. The sun, which now stood low, illumined his huge head and\r\nshaggy breasts, and in that ruddy luster he was like one of those\r\nsphinxes which ornament the entrances to ancient Egyptian temples.\r\n\r\nThe horses began to sit upon their haunches, to wince and draw back.\r\nThe amazed and frightened riders did not know what to do; so from mouth\r\nto mouth there flowed only the fearsome and helpless words, \"Allah!\r\nBismillah! Allah akbar!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the king of the wilderness gazed at them from above, motionless as\r\nif cast of bronze.\r\n\r\nGebhr and Chamis had heard from traders, who came to Egypt from the\r\nSudân with ivory and gum, that lions sometimes lie down in the paths of\r\ncaravans, which, on account of this, must turn aside. But here there\r\nwas no place which they could turn to. It behoved them perhaps to turn\r\nabout and fly. Yes! But in such case it was a certainty that the\r\ndreadful beast would rush after them in pursuit.\r\n\r\nAgain resounded the feverish interrogations:\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Allah! Perhaps he will step aside.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he will not.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again a silence fell. Only the snorting of the horses and the\r\nquickened breathing of the human breasts could be heard.\r\n\r\n\"Untie Kali!\" Chamis suddenly exclaimed to Gebhr, \"and we will escape\r\non the horses; the lion will first overtake him, and kill him only.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do that,\" repeated the Bedouins.\r\n\r\nBut Gebhr surmised that in such a case Kali, in the twinkling of an\r\neye, would climb on the rocky wall and the lion would chase after the\r\nhorses; therefore another horrible idea suggested itself to him. He\r\nwould kill the boy with his knife and fling his body ahead of him and\r\nthen the lion, dashing after them, would see on the ground the bleeding\r\ncorpse and stop to devour it.\r\n\r\nSo he dragged Kali by the rope to the saddle and had already raised his\r\nknife, when in the same second Stas clutched the wide sleeve of his\r\njubha.\r\n\r\n\"Villain! What are you doing?\"\r\n\r\nGebhr began to tug and, if the boy had seized him by the hand, he would\r\nhave freed it at once, but it was not so easy with the sleeve; so he\r\nbegan to tug, and splutter with a voice stifled with fury.\r\n\r\n\"Dog! if he is not enough, I shall stab you both! Allah! I shall stab\r\nyou! I shall stab you!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Stas paled mortally, for like lightning the thought flashed through\r\nhis mind that the lion chasing after the horses above all might\r\nactually overlook Kali, and in such case Gebhr with the greatest\r\ncertainty would stab them both in turn.\r\n\r\nSo pulling the sleeve with redoubled strength he shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Give me the short rifle! I will kill the lion!\"\r\n\r\nThese words astonished the Bedouins, but Chamis, who had witnessed\r\nStas' shooting in Port Said, began at once to cry:\r\n\r\n\"Give him the rifle! He will kill the lion.\"\r\n\r\nGebhr recollected at once the shots on Lake Karûn and in view of the\r\nhorrible danger, assented. With great haste he gave the boy the short\r\nrifle and Chamis, as quick as a thought, opened the cartridge box, from\r\nwhich Stas took a large fistful of cartridges, after which he leaped\r\noff his horse, inserted the cartridges in the barrels, and moved\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nFor the first few steps he was as though stupefied and saw only himself\r\nand Nell with throats cut by Gebhr's knife. But soon the nearer and\r\nmore horrible danger commanded him to forget about everything else. He\r\nhad a lion before him! At the sight of the animal his eyes grew dim. He\r\nfelt a chill on his cheeks and nose, he felt that he had feet as if\r\nmade of lead and he could scarcely breathe. Plainly he feared. In Port\r\nSaid he had read during the recitation time of lion-hunts, but it was\r\none thing to examine pictures in books and another to stand eye to eye\r\nwith the monster, who now gazed at him as if with amazement, wrinkling\r\nhis broad forehead which resembled a shield.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs held the breath in their breasts, for never in their lives\r\nhad they seen anything like this. On the one side was a small boy, who\r\namid the steep rocks appeared yet smaller, on the other a powerful\r\nbeast, golden in the sun's rays, magnificent, formidable--\"The lord\r\nwith the great head,\" as the Sudânese say.\r\n\r\nStas overcame with the whole force of his will the inertness of his\r\nlimbs and advanced farther. For a while yet it seemed to him that his\r\nheart had leaped up into his throat, and this feeling continued until\r\nhe raised the rifle to his face. Then it was necessary to think of\r\nsomething else. Whether to approach nearer or to fire at once; where to\r\naim. The smaller the distance the surer the shot--therefore nearer and\r\nnearer!--forty paces, too many yet;--thirty!--twenty! Already the\r\nbreeze carried the pungent animal odor.\r\n\r\nThe boy stood.\r\n\r\n\"A bullet between the eyes, or it will be all over with me,\" he\r\nthought. \"In the name of the Father and of the Son--!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the lion rose, stretched his body, and lowered his head. His lips\r\nbegan to open, his brows to contract over his eyes. This mite of being\r\nhad dared to approach too closely--so he prepared for a leap, sitting\r\nwith haunches quivering on his hind legs.\r\n\r\nBut Stas, during the twinkling of an eye, perceived that the bead of\r\nthe rifle was in a direct line with the forehead of the animal--and\r\npulled the trigger.\r\n\r\nThe shot pealed. The lion reared so that for a while he straightened\r\nout to his full height; after which he toppled over on his back with\r\nhis four paws up.\r\n\r\nAnd in the final convulsions he rolled off the rock onto the ground.\r\n\r\nStas for several minutes covered him with his rifle, but seeing that\r\nthe quivering ceased and that the tawny body was stretched out inertly,\r\nhe opened the rifle and inserted another cartridge.\r\n\r\nThe stony walls reverberated yet with the thunderous echo. Gebhr,\r\nChamis, and the Bedouins could not at once descry what had happened, as\r\non the previous night rain had fallen, and owing to the dampness of the\r\nweather the smoke veiled everything in the narrow ravine. Only when the\r\nsmoke abated, did they shout with joy, and wanted to rush towards the\r\nboy, but in vain, as no power could force the horses to move ahead.\r\n\r\nAnd Stas turned around, took in the four Arabs with his gaze and fixed\r\nhis eyes on Gebhr.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! There has been enough of this!\" he said through his set teeth.\r\n\"You have exceeded the measure. You shall not torment Nell or any one\r\nelse any more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly he felt that his nose and cheeks turned pale, but this was\r\na different chill, caused not by fright, but by a terrible and\r\ninflexible resolution from which the heart in the bosom becomes, for\r\nthe time being, iron.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! It is imperative! These are mere villains, executioners,\r\nmurderers, and Nell is in their hands!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall not murder her!\" he repeated.\r\n\r\nHe approached them--again stood, and suddenly with the rapidity of\r\nlightning raised the rifle to his face.\r\n\r\nTwo shots, one after the other, jarred the ravine with an echo. Gebhr\r\ntumbled upon the ground, and Chamis swayed in the saddle and struck his\r\nhorse's neck with his bleeding forehead.\r\n\r\nThe two Bedouins uttered a horrified cry of consternation and,\r\nspringing from the horses, dashed at Stas. A bend was not far behind\r\nthem, and if they had run in the other direction, which Stas in his\r\nsoul desired, they could have saved their lives. But blinded by terror\r\nand fury they thought that they would reach the boy before he would be\r\nable to change the cartridges, and cut him to pieces with their knives.\r\nFools! They ran barely a dozen paces when again the ill-omened rifle\r\ncracked; the ravine resounded with the echo of new shots and both fell\r\nwith faces on the ground, flouncing about like fishes taken out of\r\nwater. One of them, who in the haste was hurt the least, raised himself\r\nand propped himself on his hands, but at that moment Saba sunk his\r\nfangs in his throat.\r\n\r\nAnd mortal silence ensued.\r\n\r\nIt was broken only by the moans of Kali, who threw himself on his knees\r\nand, stretching out his hands, exclaimed in the broken Kiswahili tongue:\r\n\r\n\"Bwana kubwa! (Great master!) Kill the lion! Kill bad people, but do\r\nnot kill Kali!\"\r\n\r\nStas, however, paid no heed to his cries. For some time he stood as if\r\ndazed; after which, observing Nell's pallid face and half-conscious\r\neyes, opened widely from terror, he ran towards her.\r\n\r\n\"Nell, do not fear!--Nell, we are free!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact they actually were free, but astray in a wild, uninhabited\r\nregion, in the heart of the land of the Blacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Stas and the young negro dragged the slain Arabs and the lion's\r\nheavy body to the side of the ravine the sun had descended still more\r\nand night was soon to fall. But it was impossible to sleep in the\r\nvicinity of the corpses; so, though Kali stroked his stomach and\r\nrepeated, smacking with his tongue, \"Msuri niama\" (good meat), Stas did\r\nnot permit him to busy himself with the \"niama,\" and instead ordered\r\nhim to catch the horses, which ran away after the shooting. The black\r\nboy did this with extraordinary skill. Instead of running after them in\r\nthe ravine, in which case they would have sped away farther and\r\nfarther, he climbed to the top and, shortening his way by avoiding the\r\nbends, he intercepted the startled steeds from the front. In this\r\nmanner he easily caught two; and two more he drove towards Stas. Only\r\nGebhr's and Chamis' horses could not be found, but at any rate four\r\nremained, not counting the lap-eared creature, loaded with the tent and\r\nthings, who, in view of the tragic occurrences, displayed a true\r\nphilosophical calm. They found him beyond a bend, cropping closely and\r\nwithout any haste the grass growing on the bottom of the ravine.\r\n\r\nThe medium-sized Sudânese horses are accustomed generally to the sight\r\nof wild animals, but they fear lions, so it was with considerable\r\ndifficulty that they were led past the rock which was blackened with a\r\npuddle of blood. The horses snorted, dilating their nostrils and\r\nstretching their necks towards the blood-stained stones; nevertheless,\r\nwhen the donkey, only pricking his ears a little, passed by calmly,\r\nthey also passed on. Night had already fallen; they nevertheless rode\r\nover half a mile, and halted only in a place where the ravine widened\r\nagain into a small amphitheatrical vale, overgrown with dense thorns\r\nand prickly mimosa trees.\r\n\r\n\"Master,\" said the young negro, \"Kali will make a fire--a big fire.\"\r\n\r\nAnd taking the broad Sudânese sword, which he had removed from Gebhr's\r\ncorpse, he began to cut with it thorns and even little trees. After\r\nbuilding the fire, he continued to cut until he secured a supply which\r\nwould suffice for the whole night, after which with Stas he pitched the\r\ntent for Nell, under a steep perpendicular wall of the ravine, and\r\nlater they surrounded it with a semi-circular, broad and prickly fence,\r\nor a so-called zareba.\r\n\r\nStas knew from descriptions of African travels that travelers in this\r\nmanner safeguarded themselves against the attacks of wild animals. The\r\nhorses could not be placed within the fence; so the boy, unsaddling\r\nthem and removing the tin utensils and bags, only hobbled them so that\r\nthey should not stray too far in seeking grass or water. Mea finally\r\nfound water near-by in a stony cavity, forming as it were a little\r\nbasin under the opposite rocks. There was so copious a supply that it\r\nsufficed for the horses and the cooking of the guinea-fowls which were\r\nshot that morning by Chamis. In the pack-saddles, which the donkey\r\nbore, they also found about three pots of durra, a few fistfuls of\r\nsalt, and a bunch of dried manioc roots.\r\n\r\nThis sufficed for a bounteous supper. Kali and Mea mainly took\r\nadvantage of it. The young negro whom Gebhr had starved in a cruel\r\nmanner ate such an amount of food as would have sated two men. But for\r\nthis he was grateful with his whole heart to his new master and\r\nmistress, and immediately after supper he fell on his face before Stas\r\nand Nell in token that he desired to remain their slave to the end of\r\nhis life, and afterwards he also prostrated himself with due humility\r\nbefore Stas' short rifle, understanding that it was the best policy to\r\nconciliate so formidable a weapon. After this he announced that during\r\nthe slumber of the \"great master\" and the \"bibi\" he, alternately with\r\nMea, would watch that the fire should not go out, and squatted near it,\r\nmumbling quietly something in the nature of a song, in which every\r\nlittle while was repeated the refrain, \"Simba kufa, simba kufa,\" which\r\nin the Kiswahili language means, \"The lion is killed.\"\r\n\r\nBut the \"great master\" and the little \"bibi\" were not inclined to\r\nsleep. Nell, at Stas' urgent request, barely swallowed a few pieces of\r\nguinea-fowl and a few grains of boiled durra. She said that she did not\r\ncare to eat or sleep but only to drink. A fear seized Stas that she\r\nmight be suffering from fever, but he soon became satisfied that her\r\nhands were cool and even too cold. He persuaded her to enter the tent\r\nwhere he prepared bedding for her, first searching carefully in the\r\ngrass for scorpions. He himself sat upon a stone with short rifle in\r\nhand to defend her from attacks by wild beasts, if the fire did not\r\nafford sufficient protection. He was beset by great fatigue and\r\nexhaustion. In his soul he repeated to himself, \"I killed Gebhr and\r\nChamis; I killed the Bedouins; I killed the lion, and we are free.\" But\r\nit was as if those words were whispered to him by some one else and as\r\nif he himself did not comprehend their full meaning. He had not a\r\nfeeling that they were free, but that something awful at the same time\r\nhad happened which filled him with uneasiness and weighed upon his\r\nbosom like a heavy stone. Finally his thoughts began to grow blunt. For\r\na long time he gazed at the big moths hovering above the flame and in\r\nthe end he nodded and dozed. Kali also dozed, but awoke every little\r\nwhile and threw twigs into the fire.\r\n\r\nThe night became dark and, what is a rare occurrence under the tropics,\r\nvery still. They could hear only the cracking of the burning thorns and\r\nthe hissing of flames which illumined the overhanging rocks forming a\r\nsemi-circle. The moon did not shine into the depths of the ravine, but\r\nabove twinkled a swarm of unknown stars. The air became so cool that\r\nStas shook off his drowsiness and began to worry whether the chill\r\nwould not incommode little Nell.\r\n\r\nBut he became reassured, when he recollected that he left her under the\r\ntent upon the plaid cloth, which Dinah took with her from Fayûm. It\r\nalso occurred to him that riding continuously from the Nile upwards,\r\nthough imperceptibly, they must have ridden, through so many days,\r\nquite high; therefore to a region which was not threatened with fever\r\nas are the low river banks. The penetrating night chill appeared to\r\nconfirm this supposition.\r\n\r\nAnd this thought encouraged him. He went for a moment to Nell's tent to\r\nlisten whether she slept peacefully; after which he returned, sat\r\nnearer the fire, and again began to doze and even fell into a sound\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he was awakened by the growling of Saba, who previously had\r\nlain down to sleep close by his feet.\r\n\r\nKali awoke also and both began to look about uneasily at the mastiff,\r\nwho, stretching out like a chord, pricked his ears, and with quivering\r\nnostrils scented in the direction from which they had come, gazed\r\nfixedly at the same time into the darkness. The hair bristled on his\r\nneck and back and his breasts heaved from air which during the growling\r\nhe inhaled into his lungs.\r\n\r\nThe young slave flung dry twigs into the fire as speedily as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Master,\" he whispered. \"Take the rifle! Take the rifle!\"\r\n\r\nStas took the rifle and moved before the fire to see better in the\r\ndusky depth of the ravine. Saba's growls changed into barks. For a long\r\ntime nothing could be heard, after which, however, from the distance\r\nthere reached the ears of Kali and Stas a hollow, clattering sound as\r\nif some great animals were rushing in the direction of the fire. This\r\nsound reverberated in the stillness with an echo against the stony\r\nwalls, and became louder and louder.\r\n\r\nStas realized that a dire danger was drawing near. But what could it\r\nbe? Buffaloes, perhaps? Perhaps a pair of rhinoceroses seeking an\r\nexit from the ravine? In such case if the report of the shot did\r\nnot scare them and turn them back, nothing could save the caravan,\r\nfor those animals, not less ferocious and aggressive than rapacious\r\nbeasts, do not fear fire and tread under foot everything in their way.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it should be a division of Smain's forces who, having\r\nencountered the corpses in the ravine, are pursuing the murderers? Stas\r\ndid not know which would be better--a sudden death or new captivity? In\r\naddition it flitted through his mind that if Smain himself was in the\r\ndivision, he might spare them, but if he was not, then the dervishes\r\nwould at once kill them or, what is worse, torture them in a horrible\r\nmanner before their death. \"Ah,\" he thought, \"God grant that these are\r\nanimals, not men!\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the clatter increased and changed into a thunder of\r\nhoof-beats until finally there emerged out of the darkness glittering\r\neyes, dilated nostrils, and wind-tossed manes.\r\n\r\n\"Horses!\" cried Kali.\r\n\r\nIn fact they were Gebhr's and Chamis' horses. They came running, driven\r\nevidently by fright, but dashing into the circle of light and seeing\r\ntheir fettered companions, they reared on their hind legs; after which,\r\nsnorting, they implanted their hoofs in the ground and remained for a\r\nwhile motionless.\r\n\r\nBut Stas did not lower his rifle. He was certain that at any moment\r\nafter the horses a shaggy-haired lion or a flat-skulled panther would\r\nappear. But he waited in vain. The horses quieted slowly, and what was\r\nmore, Saba after a certain time ceased to scent. Instead, he turned\r\nabout a few times on the spot as dogs usually do, lay down, rolled\r\nhimself into a ball and closed his eyes. Apparently, if any rapacious\r\nanimal had chased the horses, then, having smelt the smoke or seen the\r\nreflection of the fire on the rocks, it had retreated into the distance.\r\n\r\n\"Something must have frightened them badly,\" Stas said to Kali, \"since\r\nthey did not fear to rush by the body of the lion and the men's\r\ncorpses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Master,\" answered the boy, \"Kali can guess what happened. Many, many\r\nhyenas and jackals entered the ravine to get at the corpses. The horses\r\nran before them, but the hyenas are not chasing them, for they are\r\neating Gebhr and those others--\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be, but do you now unsaddle the horses; remove the utensils\r\nand bags and bring them here. Do not fear, for the rifle will protect\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali does not fear,\" answered the boy.\r\n\r\nAnd pushing aside the thorns close by the rocks, he slipped out of the\r\nzareba. In the meantime Nell came out of the tent.\r\n\r\nSaba rose at once and, pressing his nose close to her, claimed his\r\nusual caress. But she, extending at first her hand, withdrew it at once\r\nas if with aversion.\r\n\r\n\"Stas, what has happened?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. Those two horses came running up. Did their hoof-beats awaken\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was awake before then and even wanted to come out of the tent, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"But what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought that you might get angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I? At you?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Nell raised her eyes and began to gaze at him with a peculiar look\r\nwith which she had never eyed him before. Great astonishment stole over\r\nStas' face, for in her words and gaze he plainly read fear.\r\n\r\n\"She fears me,\" he thought.\r\n\r\nAnd in the first moment he felt something like a gleam of satisfaction.\r\nHe was flattered by the thought that, after what he had accomplished,\r\neven Nell regarded him not only as a man fully matured, but as a\r\nformidable warrior spreading alarm about. But this lasted only a short\r\ntime, for misfortune had developed in him an observing mind and talent;\r\nhe discerned, therefore, that in those uneasy eyes of the little girl\r\ncould be seen, besides fright, abhorrence, as it were, of what had\r\nhappened, of the bloodshed and the horrors which she that day had\r\nwitnessed. He recalled how, a few moments before, she withdrew her\r\nhand, not wishing to pat Saba, who had finished, by strangling, one of\r\nthe Bedouins. Yes! Stas himself felt an incubus on his breast. It was\r\none thing to read in Port Said about American trappers, killing in the\r\nfar west red-skinned Indians by the dozens, and another to accomplish\r\nthat personally and see men, alive a short while before, struggling in\r\ntheir death-throes, in a pool of blood. Yes, Nell's heart undoubtedly\r\nwas full of fear and at the same time aversion which would always\r\nremain with her. \"She will fear me,\" Stas thought, \"and in the depths\r\nof her heart, involuntarily, she will not cease holding it ill of me,\r\nand this will be my reward for all that I have done for her.\"\r\n\r\nAt this thought great bitterness swelled in his bosom, for it was\r\napparent to him that if it were not for Nell he would either have been\r\nkilled or would have escaped. For her he suffered all that he had\r\nendured; and those tortures and that hunger resulted only in this, that\r\nshe now stood before him frightened, as if she was not the same little\r\nsister, and lifted her eyes towards him not with former trustfulness,\r\nbut with a strange fear. Stas suddenly felt very unhappy. For the first\r\ntime in his life he understood what it was to be moved to tears. In\r\nspite of his will tears flowed to his eyes and were it not for the fact\r\nthat it did not under any circumstances become \"a formidable warrior\"\r\nto weep, he might perhaps have shed tears.\r\n\r\nHe restrained himself, however, and, turning to the little girl, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Do you fear, Nell?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she replied in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"Somehow--it is so horrible!\"\r\n\r\nAt this Stas ordered Kali to bring the saddle-cloths from a saddle and,\r\ncovering with one of them a rock on which he had previously dozed, he\r\nspread the other upon the ground and said:\r\n\r\n\"Sit here beside me near the fire. How chilly the night is! If sleep\r\novercomes you, rest your head upon me and you will fall asleep.\"\r\n\r\nBut Nell repeated:\r\n\r\n\"Somehow--it is so horrible!\"\r\n\r\nStas wrapped her carefully in plaids and for some time they sat in\r\nsilence, supporting each other and illuminated by a rosy luster which\r\ncrept over the rocks and sparkled on the mica plates with which the\r\nstony fissures were bespangled.\r\n\r\nBeyond the zareba could be heard the snorting of horses and the\r\ncrunching of grass in their teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Nell,\" Stas spoke out. \"I had to do that--Gebhr threatened\r\nthat he would stab us both if the lion would not be content with Kali\r\nand should continue to pursue them. Didn't you hear him? Think of it;\r\nhe threatened by that not only me, but you. And he would have done it.\r\nI tell you sincerely that if it were not for that threat, though\r\nformerly I already was thinking of it, I would not have shot at them. I\r\nthink I could not--But he exceeded the measure. You saw how cruelly\r\nbefore that time he treated Kali. And Chamis? How vilely he betrayed\r\nus. Besides, do you know what would have happened if they did not find\r\nSmain? Gebhr would likewise have vented his anger upon us--upon you. It\r\nis dreadful to think that he would have whipped you daily with the\r\ncourbash, and would have tortured us both to death, and after our death\r\nhe would return to Fashoda and say that we died of fever. Nell, I did\r\nnot do that from fiendishness, but I had to think of this, how to save\r\nyou--I was concerned only about you--\"\r\n\r\nAnd his face plainly reflected that affliction which overflowed in his\r\nheart. Nell evidently understood this, as she pressed yet more closely\r\nto him, while he, momentarily mastering his emotions, continued thus:\r\n\r\n\"I, of course, shall not change, and shall guard and watch over you as\r\nbefore. As long as they lived there was no hope of rescue. Now we may\r\nfly to Abyssinia. The Abyssinians are black and wild, but Christians\r\nand foes of the dervishes. If you only retain your health, we shall\r\nsucceed, for it is not so very far to Abyssinia. And even though we do\r\nnot succeed, though we fall into Smain's hand, do not think that he\r\nwill revenge himself upon us. He never in his life saw either Gebhr or\r\nthe Bedouins; he knew only Chamis, but what was Chamis to him? Besides,\r\nwe need not tell Smain that Chamis was with us. If we succeed in\r\nreaching Abyssinia, then we are saved, and if not, you will not fare\r\nany worse, but better, for tyrants worse than those men probably cannot\r\nbe found in the world. Do not fear me, Nell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd desiring to win her confidence and at the same time cheer her, he\r\nbegan to stroke her little yellow head. The little maid listened,\r\nraising timidly her eyes to him. Evidently she wanted to say something\r\nbut hesitated and feared. Finally she leaned her head so that her hair\r\nentirely covered her face and asked in a yet lower and slightly\r\nquivering voice:\r\n\r\n\"Stas--\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" Stas asked with amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Those--killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about, Nell?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid! I am afraid!\"\r\n\r\nAnd her pallid lips began to quiver.\r\n\r\nSilence ensued. Stas did not believe that the slain could rise from the\r\ndead, but as it was night and their bodies lay not far away, he became\r\ndepressed in spirit; a chill passed over his back.\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying, Nell?\" he repeated. \"Then Dinah taught you to\r\nfear ghosts--The dead do not--\"\r\n\r\nAnd he did not finish, for at that moment something awe-inspiring\r\noccurred. Amid the stillness of the night, in the depths of the ravine,\r\nfrom the direction in which the corpses lay suddenly resounded a kind\r\nof inhuman, frightful laughter in which quivered despair, and joy, and\r\ncruelty, and suffering, and pain, and sobbing, and derision; the\r\nheart-rending and spasmodic laughter of the insane or condemned.\r\n\r\nNell screamed, and with her whole strength embraced Stas with her arms.\r\nStas' hair stood on end. Saba started up suddenly and began to growl.\r\n\r\nBut Kali, sitting at some distance, quietly raised his head and said\r\nalmost gleefully:\r\n\r\n\"Those are hyenas gloating over Gebhr and the lion--\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great events of the preceding day and the sensations of the night\r\nso tired out Stas and Nell that when finally slumber overcame them they\r\nfell into a deep sleep, and the little girl did nor appear outside the\r\ntent until about noon-time. Stas rose somewhat earlier from a\r\nsaddle-cloth spread near the camp-fire, and in expectation of his\r\nlittle companion he ordered Kali to prepare a breakfast, which in view\r\nof the late hour was to form at the same time their dinner.\r\n\r\nThe bright light of the day dispelled the terrors of the night; both\r\nawoke not only well rested, but refreshed in spirit. Nell looked better\r\nand felt stronger. As both wanted to ride away as far as possible from\r\nthe place where the slain Sudânese were lying, immediately after the\r\nrefreshments they mounted their horses and moved ahead.\r\n\r\nAt that time of the day all travelers in Africa stop for the noon rest,\r\nand even caravans composed of negroes seek shelter under the shade of\r\ngreat trees; for they are the so-called white hours, hours of heat and\r\nsilence, during which the sun broils unmercifully and, looking from\r\nabove, seems to seek whom to slay. Every beast at such times burrows\r\nitself in the greatest thicket, the song of birds ceases, the buzz of\r\ninsects stops, and all nature falls into silence, secreting itself as\r\nif desirous of guarding against the eye of a wicked divinity. But they\r\nrode on in the ravine in which one of the walls cast a deep shadow,\r\nenabling them to proceed without exposing themselves to the scorching\r\nheat. Stas did not want to leave the ravine, firstly, because, above,\r\nthey might be espied from a distance by Smain's detachments, and then\r\nit was easier to find, in rocky crevices, water, which in uncovered\r\nplaces soaked into the ground or under the influence of the sun's rays\r\nwas transformed into steam.\r\n\r\nThe road continuously but imperceptibly led upwards. On the rocky walls\r\ncould be seen from time to time yellow traces of sulphur. The water in\r\nthe clefts was saturated with its odor, which reminded both children\r\nunpleasantly of Omdurmân and the Mahdists, who smeared their heads with\r\nfat mixed with sulphur powder. In some places muskcats could be smelt;\r\nbut there, where from high, overhanging rocks magnificent cascades of\r\nlianas fell to the bottom of the ravine, came an intoxicating scent of\r\nvanilla. The little wanderers willingly stopped in the shade of these\r\ntapestries embroidered with purple flowers and lilies, which with the\r\nleaves provided food for the horses.\r\n\r\nAnimals could not be seen; only from time to time on the crests of\r\nrocks monkeys squatted, resembling on the blue background those\r\nfantastic idols which in India adorn the borders of temples. Big males\r\nwith long manes displayed their teeth at Saba or stretched out their\r\njaws in sign of amazement and rage, and at the same time jumped about,\r\nblinking with their eyes and scratching their sides. But Saba,\r\naccustomed already to the sight of them, did not pay much heed to their\r\nmenaces.\r\n\r\nThey rode briskly. Joy at recovering liberty drove away from Stas'\r\nbreast that incubus which had throttled him during the night. His mind\r\nwas now occupied with the thought of what was to be done farther; how\r\nto lead Nell and himself from a locality in which they were threatened\r\nby new captivity with the dervishes; what measures to adopt during the\r\nlong journey through the wilderness in order not to die of hunger and\r\nthirst, and finally, whither to go? He knew already from Hatim that the\r\nAbyssinian boundary in a direct line from Fashoda was not more than\r\nfive days' journey, and he calculated that this would be about one\r\nhundred English miles. Now from their departure from Fashoda almost two\r\nweeks had elapsed; so it was clear that they had not gone by the\r\nshortest route, but in seeking Smain must have turned considerably\r\ntowards the south. He recollected that on the sixth day they crossed a\r\nriver which was not the Nile, and that afterwards, before the country\r\nbegan to rise, they rode around great swamps. At school in Port Said,\r\nthe geography of Africa was taught very thoroughly and in Stas' memory\r\nremained the name of Ballor, designating an expansion of the\r\nlittle-known river Sobat, a tributary of the Nile. He was not indeed\r\ncertain whether they had passed that expansion, but assumed that they\r\nhad. It occurred to him that Smain, desiring to capture slaves, could\r\nnot seek for them directly west of Fashoda, as that country was already\r\nentirely depopulated by dervishes and small-pox; but that he would have\r\nto go to localities which heretofore were not visited by an expedition.\r\nStas deduced from this that they were following Smain's trail, and the\r\nthought frightened him in the first moments.\r\n\r\nHe therefore reflected whether it would not be better to abandon the\r\nravine which turned more and more plainly towards the south and go\r\ndirectly eastward. But after a moment's consideration he relinquished\r\nthe plan. On the contrary, to follow the tracks of Smain's band at two\r\nor three days' distance appeared to him to be the safest course as it\r\nwas very improbable that Smain would return with his human wares by way\r\nof the same circuitous route instead of making his way directly for the\r\nNile. Stas understood also that Abyssinia could be reached only from\r\nthe southern side where that country borders on a great wilderness and\r\nnot from the eastern boundary which was carefully guarded by dervishes.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these thoughts he determined to venture as far as\r\npossible towards the south. They might encounter negroes, either\r\nrefugees from the banks of the White Nile or natives. But of the two\r\nevils Stas preferred to have dealings with the blacks rather than with\r\nMahdists. He reckoned too that in the event of meeting refugees or\r\nnatives Kali and Mea might prove useful. It was enough to glance at the\r\nyoung negress to surmise that she belonged to the Dinka or Shilluk\r\ntribe, for she had uncommonly long and thin limbs, so characteristic of\r\nboth of those tribes, dwelling on the banks of the Nile and wading like\r\ncranes and storks, during its inundation. Kali, on the other hand,\r\nthough under Gebhr's hand he became like a skeleton, had an entirely\r\ndifferent stature. He was short and thick and strongly built; he had\r\npowerful shoulders and his feet in comparison with Mea's feet were\r\nrelatively small.\r\n\r\nAs he did not speak Arabian at all and spoke poorly the Kiswahili\r\nlanguage with which one can converse almost anywhere in Africa and\r\nwhich Stas had learned fairly well from the natives of Zanzibar,\r\nworking on the Canal, it was evident that he came from some distant\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nStas determined to sound him upon this point.\r\n\r\n\"Kali, what is the name of your people?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Wahima,\" answered the young negro.\r\n\r\n\"Is that a great nation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Great, which is making war upon the bad Samburus and takes their\r\ncattle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that country like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. There are mountains and great water.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that water called?\"\r\n\r\n\"We call it 'The Dark Water.'\"\r\n\r\nStas thought that the boy might come from the neighborhood of the\r\nAlbert Nyanza, which up to that time had been in the hands of Emin\r\nPasha; so, desiring to confirm this, he asked further:\r\n\r\n\"Does not a white chief live there who has black smoking boats and\r\ntroops?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the old men with us say that they saw white men, (here Kali parted\r\nhis fingers) one, two, three. Yes. There were three of them in long\r\nwhite dresses. They were looking for tusks. Kali did not see them for\r\nhe was not in the world, but Kali's father received them and gave them\r\nmany cows.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"The king of Wahima.\"\r\n\r\nStas was flattered a little by the idea that he had a Prince Royal for\r\na servant.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to see your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali wants to see his mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do if we met the Wahimas, and what would they do?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Wahimas would fall on their faces before Kali.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lead us to them; then you shall remain with them and rule after your\r\nfather, and we will go farther to the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali cannot find the way to them, and cannot remain, for Kali loves\r\nthe great master and the daughter of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nStas turned merrily to his companion and said:\r\n\r\n\"Nell, you have become the daughter of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nBut, glancing at her, he saddened suddenly, for it occurred to him that\r\nthe emaciated girl actually looked with her pale and transparent\r\ncountenance more like a lunar than an earthly being.\r\n\r\nThe young negro became silent for a while; then he repeated:\r\n\r\n\"Kali loves Bwana kubwa, for Bwana kubwa did not kill Kali, only Gebhr,\r\nand gives Kali a great deal to eat.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to stroke his breast, repeating with evident delight:\r\n\r\n\"A great deal of meat! a great deal of meat!\"\r\n\r\nStas wanted to ascertain how Kali became the slave of the dervishes; it\r\nappeared that from the night when he was caught in a pit, dug for\r\nzebras, he had gone through so many hands that Stas could not tell from\r\nhis statements what countries he had passed through and by what route\r\nhe had been conducted to Fashoda. Stas was much impressed by what he\r\nsaid about the \"dark water,\" for if he came from the region of Albert\r\nNyanza, Albert Edward Nyanza, or even Victoria Nyanza, near which lay\r\nthe kingdoms of the Unyoro and the Uganda, he would undoubtedly have\r\nheard something about Emin Pasha, about his troops, and about the\r\nsteamers, which aroused the wonder and fear of the negroes. Tanganyika\r\nwas too far away; there remained only the supposition that Kali's\r\nnation had its seat somewhere nearer. For this reason their meeting\r\nwith the Wahimas was not an utter improbability.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours' ride, the sun began to descend. The heat decreased\r\nconsiderably. They chanced upon a wide valley in which they found water\r\nand a score or more of wild fig trees. So they stopped to rest their\r\nhorses and partake of provisions. As the rocky walls at that place were\r\nlower, Stas ordered Kali to climb to the top and ascertain whether\r\nsmoke could not be seen in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nKali complied with the order and in the twinkling of an eye reached the\r\nedge of the rocks. Peering around carefully in all directions he slid\r\ndown a thick liana stalk and announced that there was no smoke, but\r\nthat there were \"niama.\" It was easy to surmise that he was speaking\r\nnot of guinea-fowl but of some bulkier game, for he pointed at Stas'\r\nshort rifle and afterwards put his fingers on his head to indicate\r\nhorned game.\r\n\r\nStas in turn climbed up and, leaning his head carefully over the edge,\r\nbegan to look ahead. Nothing obstructed his view of the expanse, as the\r\nold, high jungle was burnt away and the new, which had already sprouted\r\nfrom the blackened ground, was barely a few inches high. As far as the\r\neye could reach could be seen sparsely growing great trees, with trunks\r\nsinged by the fire. Under the shade of one of them grazed a flock of\r\nantelopes which from the shape of their bodies resembled horses, and\r\nfrom their heads buffaloes. The sun penetrating through the baobab\r\nleaves cast quivering bright spots upon their brown backs. There were\r\nten of them. The distance was not more than one hundred paces, but the\r\nwind blew from the animals towards the ravine, so they grazed quietly,\r\nnot suspecting any danger. Stas, desiring to replenish his supplies\r\nwith meat, shot at the nearest one, which tumbled on the ground as if\r\nstruck by lightning. The rest of the flock ran away, and with them a\r\ngreat buffalo, which he did not perceive before, as he lay hidden\r\nbehind a stone. The boy, not from necessity, but from a sporting vein,\r\nchoosing the moment when the animal turned his side somewhat, sent a\r\nbullet after him. The buffalo staggered greatly after the shot, drew in\r\nhis haunches, but rushed away, and before Stas was able to reload\r\ndisappeared in the unevenness of the ground.\r\n\r\nBefore the smoke blew away, Kali sat upon the antelope and cut open its\r\nabdomen with Gebhr's knife. Stas walked towards him, desiring to\r\ninspect more closely the animal, and great was his surprise when after\r\na while the young negro with blood-stained hands handed to him the\r\nreeking liver of the antelope.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you giving me that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Msuri, msuri! Bwana kubwa eat at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat it yourself,\" replied Stas, indignant at the proposition.\r\n\r\nKali did not allow this command to be repeated, but immediately began\r\nto tear the liver with his teeth, and greedily gulp down the raw\r\npieces; seeing that Stas gazed at him with loathing he did not cease\r\nbetween one gulp and another to repeat: \"Msuri! msuri!\"\r\n\r\nIn this manner he ate over half of the liver; after which he started to\r\ndress the antelope. He did this with uncommon quickness and skill, so\r\nthat soon the hide was flayed and the haunches were separated from the\r\nbackbone. Then Stas, somewhat surprised that Saba was not present at\r\nthis work, whistled for him to come to a bounteous feast of the fore\r\nparts of the animal.\r\n\r\nBut Saba did not appear at all. Instead, Kali, who was bending over the\r\nantelope, raised his head and said:\r\n\r\n\"The big dog ran after the buffalo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see him?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"Kali saw.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he placed the loin of the antelope on his head and the two\r\nhaunches on his shoulders and started for the ravine. Stas whistled a\r\nfew times more and waited, but seeing that he was doing this in vain,\r\nfollowed Kali. In the ravine Mea was already engaged in cutting the\r\nthorns for a zareba, while Nell, picking with her little fingers the\r\nlast guinea-fowl, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Did you whistle for Saba? He ran after you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He ran after a buffalo which I wounded with a shot, and I am worried,\"\r\nStas answered. \"Those animals are terribly ferocious and so powerful\r\nthat even a lion fears to attack them. Saba may fare badly if he begins\r\na fight with such an adversary.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this Nell became alarmed and declared that she would not go to\r\nsleep until Saba returned. Stas, seeing her grief, was angry at himself\r\nbecause he had not concealed the danger from her and began to comfort\r\nher:\r\n\r\n\"I would go after them with the rifle,\" he said, \"but they must now be\r\nvery far away, and soon the night will fall and the tracks will be\r\ninvisible. The buffalo is badly wounded, and I have a hope that he will\r\nfall. In any case he will weaken through loss of blood, and if he\r\nshould rush at Saba, Saba will be able to run away. Yes! he may return\r\nduring the night, but he surely will return.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he said this, he did not greatly believe his own words, for he\r\nremembered what he had read of the extraordinarily revengeful nature of\r\nthe African buffalo, which, though heavily wounded, will run about in a\r\ncircuit and lie in ambush near a path over which the hunter goes and\r\nafterwards attack him unexpectedly, pin him on its horns, and toss him\r\ninto the air. Something similar might happen to Saba; not to speak of\r\nother dangers which threatened him on the return to the camp during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIn fact night soon fell. Kali and Mea put up a zareba, built a fire,\r\nand prepared supper. Saba did not return.\r\n\r\nNell became more and more worried and finally began to cry.\r\n\r\nStas with difficulty persuaded her to lie down, promising her that he\r\nwould wait for Saba, and as soon as the day should break, he himself\r\nwould search for the dog and bring him back. Nell indeed entered the\r\ntent, but at intervals she put out her little head from under its\r\nfolds, asking whether the dog had not returned. Sleep overcame her only\r\nafter midnight, when Mea came out to relieve Kali, who watched the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Why does the daughter of the moon weep?\" the young negro asked Stas,\r\nwhen both lay down on the saddle-cloths. \"Kali does not want that.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is sorry for Saba, whom the buffalo has surely killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But perhaps he did not kill him,\" replied the black boy.\r\n\r\nAfter this they became silent and Stas fell into a deep sleep. It was\r\nstill dark, however, when he awoke, for the chill began to incommode\r\nhim. The fire was partly extinct. Mea, who was to watch the fire, dozed\r\nand after a time had ceased throwing fuel upon the flames.\r\n\r\nThe saddle-cloth on which Kali slept was unoccupied.\r\n\r\nStas himself threw brushwood onto the fire, after which he shook the\r\nnegress and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Where is Kali?\"\r\n\r\nFor a time she stared at him unconsciously; afterwards coming to her\r\nsenses, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Kali took Gebhr's sword and went beyond the zareba. I thought he\r\nwanted to cut more brushwood, but he did not return at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he go long ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Long.\"\r\n\r\nStas waited for some time, but as the negro did not return, he\r\ninvoluntarily propounded to himself the question:\r\n\r\n\"Did he run away?\"\r\n\r\nAnd his heart was oppressed by the disagreeable feeling which human\r\ningratitude always arouses. Why! he had interceded for this Kali and\r\ndefended him when Gebhr vented his rage upon him for whole days, and\r\nafterwards he had saved the slave's life. Nell was always kind to him\r\nand had wept over his unhappy lot, and both treated him in the best\r\npossible manner. Now he ran away! He himself had said that he did not\r\nknow in which direction the Wahima settlements were situated, and\r\nthough he would be unable to find them, he nevertheless ran away. Stas\r\nagain recollected those \"African Travels\" in Port Said, and the\r\nnarratives of travelers about the stupidity of negroes, who, throwing\r\naway packages, run away although in their escape they are threatened by\r\ninevitable death. In fact, Kali, having as his only weapon Gebhr's\r\nSudânese sword, must die of starvation, or if he did not fall again\r\ninto the captivity of the dervishes would become the prey of wild\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nAh! Ingrate and fool!\r\n\r\nStas then began to meditate over this;--how far more difficult and\r\nvexatious the journey without Kali would be for them, and how much\r\nheavier the work. To water the horses and fetter them for the night, to\r\npitch the tent, build zarebas, watch during the journey that none of\r\nthe supplies and packets with things were lost, to flay and dress the\r\nslain animals, all this for want of the young negro was to fall upon\r\nhim and he admitted in his soul that as to some of these employments,\r\nflaying the hides of animals, for instance, he did not have the\r\nslightest knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! it will be hard,\" he said, \"but necessary.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the sun emerged from beyond the horizon and, as usually\r\nhappens in the tropics, in a moment it was day. Somewhat later the\r\nwater for bathing, which Mea had prepared during the night for the\r\nlittle lady, began to splash, which meant that Nell had risen and was\r\ndressing herself. In fact, she soon appeared, already dressed, with a\r\ncomb in her hand and her hair still unkempt.\r\n\r\n\"And Saba?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"He has not come yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe lips of the little girl at once began to quiver.\r\n\r\n\"He may yet return,\" said Stas. \"You remember that on the desert\r\nsometimes he was not seen for two days, and afterwards he always\r\novertook us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said that you would go and search for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Stas?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot leave you in the ravine alone with Mea.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Kali?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali is not here.\"\r\n\r\nStas was silent, not knowing whether to tell her the whole truth; but\r\nas the matter could not be concealed he thought it best to divulge it\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n\"Kali took Gebhr's sword,\" he said, \"and in the night went away; I do\r\nnot know where. Who knows whether he has not run away? The negroes\r\noften do that, even to their own destruction. I am sorry for him--But\r\nhe may understand that he has acted like a fool and--\"\r\n\r\nFurther words were interrupted by Saba's joyful barking which filled\r\nthe whole ravine. Nell threw the comb on the ground and wanted to rush\r\nout to meet him. She was prevented, however, by the thorns of the\r\nzareba.\r\n\r\nStas, with the greatest haste, began to scatter them about, but before\r\nhe had opened a passage Saba appeared and after him Kali, as shiny and\r\nwet from the dew as if after the greatest rain.\r\n\r\nImmense joy possessed both children, and when Kali, out of breath from\r\nfatigue, came inside the enclosure, Nell flung her white hands around\r\nhis black neck and hugged him with all her strength.\r\n\r\nAnd he said:\r\n\r\n\"Kali did not want to see the 'bibi' cry, so Kali found the dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good boy, Kali!\" answered Stas, slapping him on the shoulders. \"Did\r\nyou not fear in the night that you would meet a lion or a panther?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali feared, but Kali went,\" answered the boy.\r\n\r\nThese words gained still more the hearts of the children. Stas, at\r\nNell's request, took out from one of the small pieces of luggage a\r\nstring of glass beads with which they had been provided by the Greek,\r\nKaliopuli, on their departure from Omdurmân; with it he decorated\r\nKali's splendid throat; while the latter, overjoyed with the gift,\r\nglanced at once with pride at Mea and said:\r\n\r\n\"Mea has no beads and Kali has, for Kali is 'the great world.'\"\r\n\r\nIn this manner was the devotion of the black boy rewarded. On the other\r\nhand Saba received a sharp rebuke, from which, for the second time in\r\nNell's service, he learned that he was perfectly horrid, and that if he\r\nonce more did anything like that he would be led by a string like a\r\npuppy. He heard this, wagging his tail in quite an equivocal manner.\r\nNell, however, claimed that it could be seen from his eyes that he was\r\nashamed and that he certainly blushed; only this could not be seen\r\nbecause his mouth was covered with hair.\r\n\r\nAfter this followed breakfast, consisting of excellent wild figs and a\r\nrump of venison. During the breakfast Kali related his adventures,\r\nwhile Stas interpreted them in English for Nell who did not understand\r\nthe Kiswahili language. The buffalo, as it appeared, fled far. It was\r\ndifficult for Kali to find the tracks as it was a moonless night.\r\nFortunately, rain had fallen two days before and the ground was not too\r\nhard; in consequence of this the heavy animal's hoofs left deep\r\nimprints upon it. Kali sought them with the aid of his toes and walked\r\na long distance. The buffalo finally fell and must have dropped dead as\r\nthere was no sign of a fight between him and Saba. When Kali found them\r\nSaba already had devoured the greater part of the fore quarter of the\r\nbuffalo, and although he was fully sated he would not permit the\r\napproach of two hyenas and about a dozen of jackals, which stood\r\nwaiting until the more powerful rapacious creature finished his feast\r\nand left. The boy complained that the dog also growled at him, but he\r\nthen threatened him with the anger of the \"great master\" and the\r\n\"bibi,\" after which he grabbed him by the collar and dragged him from\r\nthe buffalo, and did not let go of him until they reached the ravine.\r\n\r\nWith this ended the narrative of Kali's nocturnal adventures, after\r\nwhich all in good humor mounted their horses and proceeded on their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nOne alone, long-limbed Mea, though quiet and meek, gazed with envy at\r\nthe young negro's necklace and Saba's collar, and with sorrow in her\r\nheart thought:\r\n\r\n\"Both of them are 'the great world,' and I have only a brass ring on\r\none leg.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the following three days they rode continuously in the ravine\r\nand always upwards. The days were as a rule scorching, the nights\r\nalternately cool or sultry; the rainy season was approaching. From\r\nbeyond the horizon here and there emerged clouds, white as milk but\r\ndeep and heavy. At the sides could already be seen stripes of rain and\r\ndistant rainbows. Towards the morning of the third day one of these\r\nclouds burst above their heads like a barrel from which the hoops had\r\nflown off and sprinkled them with a warm and copious rain which\r\nfortunately was of brief duration. Afterwards the weather became fine\r\nand they could ride farther. Guinea-fowls again appeared in such\r\nnumbers that Stas shot at them without dismounting from his horse, and\r\nin this manner got five, which more than sufficed for one meal, even\r\ncounting Saba. Travel in the refreshed air was not burdensome, and the\r\nabundance of game and water removed fears of hunger and thirst. On the\r\nwhole everything passed more easily than they had anticipated. So then\r\ngood humor did not desert Stas, and, riding beside the little girl, he\r\nchattered merrily with her and at times even joked.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Nell,\" he said, when for a while he stopped the horses\r\nunder a great bread-fruit tree from which Kali and Mea cut off fruit\r\nresembling huge melons, \"at times it seems to me that I am a\r\nknight-errant.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is a knight-errant?\" asked Nell, turning her pretty head\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n\"Long, long ago in the mediaeval days there were knights who rode over\r\nthe world, looking for adventure. They fought with giants and dragons,\r\nand do you know that each one had his lady, whom he protected and\r\ndefended?\"\r\n\r\n\"And am I such a lady?\"\r\n\r\nStas pondered for a while, after which he replied:\r\n\r\n\"No, you are too small. All those others were grown up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it never occurred to him that probably no knight-errant had ever\r\nperformed as much for his lady as he had done for his little sister.\r\nPlainly it appeared to him that whatever he had done was done as a\r\nmatter of course.\r\n\r\nBut Nell felt aggrieved at his words; so with a pout she said:\r\n\r\n\"And you once said in the desert that I acted like a person of\r\nthirteen. Aha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was once. But you are eight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then after ten years I shall be eighteen.\"\r\n\r\n\"A great thing! And I shall be twenty-four! At such age a man does not\r\nthink of any ladies for he has something else to do; that is\r\nself-evident.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be an engineer or a sailor or, if there is a war in Poland, I\r\nshall go to fight, just as my father did.\"\r\n\r\nWhile she asked uneasily:\r\n\r\n\"But you will return to Port Said?\"\r\n\r\n\"We both must return there first.\"\r\n\r\n\"To papa!\" the little girl replied.\r\n\r\nAnd her eyes were dimmed with sorrow and longing. Fortunately there\r\nflew at that moment a small flock of wonderfully fine parrots, gray,\r\nwith rosy heads, and a rosy lining under their wings. The children at\r\nonce forgot about their previous conversation and began to follow the\r\nflight with their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe little flock circled about a group of euphorbias and lighted upon\r\nsycamores, growing at some distance, amidst the branches of which\r\nresounded voices similar to a wordy conference or a quarrel.\r\n\r\n\"Those are parrots which are very easily taught to talk,\" Stas said.\r\n\"When we stop at a place for a length of time, I will try to catch one\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Stas, thank you!\" answered Nell gleefully. \"I will call it Daisy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mea and Kali, having cut off fruit from the bread-fruit\r\ntree, loaded the horses with it, and the little caravan proceeded. In\r\nthe afternoon it began to cloud and at times brief showers occurred,\r\nfilling the crevices and the depressions in the earth. Kali predicted a\r\ngreat downpour, so it occurred to Stas that the ravine, which was\r\nbecoming narrower and narrower, would not be a safe shelter for the\r\nnight, for it could change into a torrent. For this reason he\r\ndetermined to pass the night above, and this decision delighted Nell,\r\nparticularly when Kali, who was sent to reconnoitre, returned and\r\nannounced that not far away was a small grove composed of various\r\ntrees, and in it many monkeys, not as ugly as the baboons which up to\r\nthat time they had met.\r\n\r\nChancing thereafter upon a place at which the rocky walls were low and\r\nsloped gradually, he led the horses out, and before it grew dark they\r\nbuilt a barricade for the night. Nell's tent stood on a high and dry\r\nspot close to a big white-ant hillock, which barred the access from one\r\nside and for that reason lessened the labor of building the zareba.\r\n\r\nNear-by stood a large tree with widely spread boughs which, covered by\r\ndense foliage, furnished shelter against rain. In front of the zareba\r\ngrew single clumps of trees and further a thick forest entangled with\r\nclimbing plants, beyond which loftily shot out crowns of strange palm\r\ntrees resembling gigantic fans or outspread peacock tails.\r\n\r\nStas learned from Kali that before the second rainy season, that is, in\r\nautumn, it was dangerous to pass the night under these palm trees, for\r\nthe huge-fruit, at that time ripe, breaks off unexpectedly and falls\r\nfrom a considerable distance with such force that it can kill a person\r\nor even a horse. At present, however, the fruit was in bud, and in the\r\ndistance before the sun set there could be seen, under the crowns,\r\nagile little monkeys, which, leaping gaily, chased each other.\r\n\r\nStas, with Kali, prepared a great supply of wood, sufficient for the\r\nwhole night, and, as at times strong blasts of hot air broke out, they\r\nreinforced the zareba with pickets which the young negro whittled with\r\nGebhr's sword and stuck in the ground. This precaution was not at all\r\nsuperfluous, as a powerful whirlwind could scatter the thorny boughs\r\nwith which the zareba was constructed and facilitate an attack by\r\nbeasts of prey.\r\n\r\nHowever, immediately after sunset the wind ceased, and instead, the air\r\nbecame sultry and heavy. Through the rifts in the clouds the stars\r\nglittered here and there, but afterwards the night became so utterly\r\ndark that one could not see a step ahead. The little wanderers grouped\r\nabout the fire, while their ears were assailed by the loud cries and\r\nshrieks of monkeys who in the adjacent forest created a veritable\r\nbedlam. This was accompanied by the whining of jackals and by various\r\nother voices in which could be recognized uneasiness and fright before\r\nsomething which under the cover of darkness threatened every living\r\nbeing in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the voices subsided for in the dusky depths resounded the\r\ngroans of a lion. The horses, which were pastured at some distance on\r\nthe young jungle, began to approach the fire, starting up suddenly on\r\ntheir fettered fore legs, while the hair on Saba, who usually was so\r\nbrave, bristled, and with tail curled under him, he nestled close to\r\nthe people, evidently seeking their protection.\r\n\r\nThe groaning again resounded, as though it came from under the ground;\r\ndeep, heavy, strained, as if the beast with difficulty drew it from its\r\npowerful lungs. It proceeded lowly over the ground, alternately\r\nincreased and subsided, passing at times into a hollow, prodigiously\r\nmournful moan.\r\n\r\n\"Kali, throw fuel into the fire,\" commanded Stas.\r\n\r\nThe negro threw upon the camp-fire an armful of boughs so hastily that\r\nat first whole sheaves of sparks burst out, after which a high flame\r\nshot up.\r\n\r\n\"Stas, the lion will not attack us, will he?\" whispered Nell, pulling\r\nthe boy by the sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"No, he will not attack us. See how high the zareba is.\"\r\n\r\nAnd speaking thus, he actually believed that danger did not threaten\r\nthem, but he was alarmed about the horses, which pressed more and more\r\nclosely to the fence and might trample it down.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the groans changed into the protracted, thunderous roar\r\nby which all living creatures are struck with terror, and the nerves of\r\npeople, who do not know what fear is, shake, just as the window-panes\r\nrattle from distant cannonading.\r\n\r\nStas cast a fleeting glance at Nell, and seeing her quivering chin and\r\nmoist eyes, said:\r\n\r\n\"Do not fear; don't cry.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she answered as if with difficulty:\r\n\r\n\"I do not want to cry--only my eyes perspire--oh!\"\r\n\r\nThe last ejaculation burst from her lips because at that moment from\r\nthe direction of the forest thundered a second roar even stronger than\r\nthe first for it was nearer. The horses began to push upon the zareba\r\nand were it not for the long and hard-as-steel thorns of the acacia\r\nbranches, they would have demolished it. Saba growled and at the same\r\ntime trembled like a leaf, while Kali began to repeat with a broken\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"Master, two! two! two!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the lions, aware of each other's presence, did not cease roaring,\r\nand the horrible concert continued in the darkness incessantly, for\r\nwhen one beast became silent the other began again. Stas soon could not\r\ndistinguish from where the sounds came, as the echoes repeated them in\r\nthe ravine; rock sent them back to rock, they ascended and descended,\r\nfilling the forest and the jungle, and the entire darkness with thunder\r\nand fear.\r\n\r\nTo the boy one thing seemed certain, and that was that they approached\r\nnearer and nearer. Kali perceived likewise that the lions ran about the\r\nencampment making a smaller circle each moment, and that, prevented\r\nfrom making an attack only by the glare of the flames, they were\r\nexpressing their dissatisfaction and fear by their roar.\r\n\r\nEvidently, however, he thought that danger threatened only the horses,\r\nas, spreading his fingers, he said:\r\n\r\n\"The lions will kill one, two, not all! not all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Throw wood into the fire,\" repeated Stas.\r\n\r\nA livelier flame burst forth; the roars suddenly ceased. But Kali,\r\nraising his head and gazing upwards, began to listen.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"Rain,\" replied the negro.\r\n\r\nStas in turn listened. The branches of the tree mantled the tent and\r\nthe whole zareba so that not a drop of rain fell upon the ground, but\r\nabove could be heard the rustle of leaves. As the sultry air was not\r\nstirred by the slightest breeze, it was easy to surmise that it was the\r\nrain which began to murmur in the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe rustle increased with each moment and after a time the children saw\r\ndrops flowing from the leaves, similar in the luster of the fire to\r\nruddy pearls. As Kali had forecast, a downpour began. The rustle\r\nchanged into a roar. Ever-increasing drops fell, and finally through\r\nthe dense foliage whole streams of water began to penetrate.\r\n\r\nThe camp-fire darkened. In vain Kali threw whole armfuls into it. On\r\nthe surface the wet boughs smoked only, and below, the burning wood\r\nbegan to hiss and the flame, however much it was replenished, began to\r\nbe extinguished.\r\n\r\n\"When the downpour quenches the fire, the zareba will defend us,\" Stas\r\nsaid to pacify Nell.\r\n\r\nAfter which he conducted the little girl into the tent and wrapped her\r\nin plaids, but he himself went out as quickly as possible as the\r\nbriefly interrupted roars had broken out again. This time they sounded\r\nconsiderably nearer and as if they were gleeful.\r\n\r\nThe downpour intensified with each moment. The rain pattered on the\r\nhard leaves and splashed. If the camp-fire had not been under the\r\nshelter of the boughs, it would have been quenched at once, but as it\r\nwas there hovered over it mainly smoke, amid which narrow, blue little\r\nflames glittered. Kali gave up the task and did not add any more\r\ndeadwood. Instead he flung a rope around the tree and with its aid\r\nclimbed higher and higher on the trunk.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"Kali climbs the tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" shouted the boy, indignant at the negro's selfishness.\r\n\r\nBright, dreadful flashes of lightning rent the darkness and Kali's\r\nreply was drowned by a peal of thunder which shook heaven and the\r\nwilderness. Simultaneously a whirlwind broke out, tugged the boughs of\r\nthe tree, swept away in the twinkling of an eye the camp-fire, seized\r\nthe embers, still burning under the ashes, and carried them with\r\nsheaves of sparks into the jungle.\r\n\r\nImpenetrable darkness temporarily encompassed the camp. A terrible\r\ntropical storm raged on earth and in the sky. Thunder followed thunder,\r\nlightning, lightning. The gory zigzags of thunderbolts rent the sky,\r\nblack as a pall. On the neighboring rocks appeared strange blue balls,\r\nwhich sometimes rolled along the ravine and then burst with a blinding\r\nlight and broke out with a peal so terrible that it seemed as if the\r\nrocks would be reduced to powder from the shock.\r\n\r\nAfterwards darkness again followed.\r\n\r\nStas became alarmed about Nell and went groping in the darkness to the\r\ntent. The tent, protected by the white-ant hillock and the giant\r\ntree-trunk, stood yet, but the first strong buffet of the whirlwind\r\nmight pull out the ropes and carry it the Lord knows where. And the\r\nwhirlwind subsided, then broke out again with a fury, carrying waves of\r\nrain, and clouds of leaves, and branches broken off in the adjacent\r\nforest. Stas was beset with despair. He did not know whether to leave\r\nNell in the tent or lead her out of it. In the first case she might get\r\nentangled in the ropes and be seized with the linen folds, and in the\r\nother she would get a thorough drenching and also would be carried\r\naway, as Stas, though beyond comparison stronger, with the greatest\r\ndifficulty could keep on his feet.\r\n\r\nThe problem was solved by the whirlwind which a moment later carried\r\naway the top of the tent. The linen walls now did not afford any\r\nshelter. Nothing else remained to do but to wait in the darkness in\r\nwhich the lions lurked, until the storm passed away.\r\n\r\nStas conjectured that probably the lions had sought shelter from the\r\ntempest in the neighboring forest, but he was certain that after the\r\nstorm they would return. The danger of the situation increased because\r\nthe wind had totally swept away the zareba.\r\n\r\nEverything was threatened with destruction. The rifle could not avail\r\nfor anything, nor could his energy. In the presence of the storm,\r\nthunderbolts, hurricane, rain, darkness, and the lions, which might be\r\nconcealed but a few paces away, he felt disarmed and helpless. The\r\nlinen walls tugged by the wind splashed them with water from all sides,\r\nso, enclosing Nell in his arms, he led her from the tent; after which\r\nboth nestled close to the trunk of the tree, awaiting death or divine\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, between one blow of the wind and another, Kali's voice\r\nreached them, barely audible amidst the splashing of the rain.\r\n\r\n\"Great master! Up the tree! up the tree!\"\r\n\r\nAnd simultaneously the end of a wet rope, lowered from above, touched\r\nthe boy's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Tie the 'bibi,' and Kali will pull her up!\" the negro continued to\r\nshout.\r\n\r\nStas did not hesitate a moment. Wrapping Nell in a saddle-cloth in\r\norder that the rope should not cut her body, he tied a girdle around\r\nher; after which he lifted her and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Pull!\"\r\n\r\nThe first boughs of the tree were quite low so Nell's aerial journey\r\nwas brief. Kali soon seized her with his powerful arms and placed her\r\nbetween the trunk and a giant bough, where there was sufficient room\r\nfor half a dozen of such diminutive beings. No wind could blow her away\r\nfrom there and in addition, even although water flowed all over the\r\ntree, the trunk, about fifteen feet thick, shielded her at least from\r\nnew waves of rain borne obliquely by the wind.\r\n\r\nHaving attended to the safety of the little \"bibi,\" the negro again\r\nlowered the rope for Stas, but he, like a captain who is the last to\r\nleave a sinking ship, ordered Mea to go ahead of him.\r\n\r\nKali did not at all need to pull her as in a moment she climbed the\r\nrope with skill and agility as if she were the full sister of a\r\nchimpanzee. For Stas it was considerably more difficult, but he was too\r\nwell-trained an athlete not to overcome the weight of his own body\r\ntogether with the rifle and a score of cartridges with which he filled\r\nhis pockets.\r\n\r\nIn this manner all four found themselves in the tree. Stas was so\r\naccustomed to think of Nell in every situation that now he was\r\noccupied, above all, in ascertaining whether she was not in danger of\r\nfalling, whether she had sufficient room and whether she could lie down\r\ncomfortably. Satisfied in this respect, he began to wrack his brains as\r\nto how to protect her from the rain. But for this there was no help. It\r\nwould have been easy to construct during the daytime some kind of roof\r\nover her head, but now they were enveloped in such darkness that they\r\ncould not see each other at all. If the storm at last passed away and\r\nif they succeeded in starting the fire again, they might dry Nell's\r\ndress! Stas, with despair, thought that the little girl, soaked to the\r\nskin, would undoubtedly on the following day suffer from the first\r\nattack of fever.\r\n\r\nHe feared that towards the morning, after the storm, it would be as\r\ncool as it was on the previous night. Thus far the wind was rather warm\r\nand the rain as though heated. Stas was surprised at its persistence as\r\nhe knew that the more strongly a storm raged the shorter was its\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time the thunder abated and the buffets of the wind\r\nweakened, but the rain continued to fall, less copious, indeed, than\r\nbefore, but so heavy and thick that the leaves did not afford any\r\nprotection against it. From below came the murmur of water as if the\r\nwhole jungle were transformed into a lake. Stas thought that in the\r\nravine certain death would have awaited them. Immense sorrow possessed\r\nhim at the thought of what might have become of Saba, and he did not\r\ndare to speak of him to Nell. He, nevertheless, had a slight hope that\r\nthe intelligent dog would find a safe haven among the rocks projecting\r\nabove the ravine. There was not, however, a possibility of going to him\r\nwith any aid.\r\n\r\nThey sat, therefore, one beside the other amid the expanding boughs,\r\ndrenched and waiting for the day. After the lapse of a few more hours\r\nthe air began to cool and the rain finally ceased. The water too flowed\r\ndown the slope to a lower place as they could not hear a splash or a\r\nmurmur. Stas had observed on the previous days that Kali understood how\r\nto stir up a fire with wet twigs, so it occurred to him to order the\r\nnegro to descend and try whether he would not succeed this time. But at\r\nthe moment in which he turned to him something happened which froze the\r\nblood in the veins of all four.\r\n\r\nThe deep silence of the night was rent suddenly by the squeaking of\r\nhorses, horrible, shrill, full of pain, fears, and mortal dismay. Some\r\nmischief was afoot in the darkness; there resounded short rattlings in\r\nthe throat, afterwards hollow groans, a snorting, a second squeak yet\r\nmore penetrating, after which all was quiet.\r\n\r\n\"Lions, great Master! Lions killing horses!\" whispered Kali.\r\n\r\nThere was something so horrible in this night attack, in the superior\r\nforce of the monsters, and in the sudden slaughter of the defenseless\r\nanimals that Stas for a time was struck with consternation, and forgot\r\nabout the rifle. What, after all, would it have availed him to shoot in\r\nsuch darkness? Unless for this, that those midnight assassins, if the\r\nflash and report should frighten them, would abandon the horses already\r\nkilled, and start after those which were scared away and had run from\r\nthe camp as far as their fettered legs would permit them.\r\n\r\nStas' flesh began to creep at the thought of what would have happened\r\nif they had remained below. Nell, nestling close to him, shook as if\r\nshe already were suffering the first attack of fever, but the tree at\r\nleast protected them from an attack of lions. Kali plainly had saved\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, a horrible night--the most horrible in the entire\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThey sat like drenched birds on a twig, listening to what was happening\r\nbelow. And there for some time a deep silence continued, but soon came\r\na peculiar sound as though of lapping, smacking of torn-off pieces of\r\nflesh, together with the horses' heavy breathing and the groans of the\r\nmonsters.\r\n\r\nThe odor of the raw meat and blood reached up to the tree, as the lions\r\nfeasted not farther than twenty paces from the zareba.\r\n\r\nAnd they feasted so long that in the end anger seized Stas. He seized\r\nthe rifle and fired in the direction of the sounds.\r\n\r\nBut he was answered only by a broken, irritated roar, after which\r\nresounded the cracking of bones, rattling in powerful jaws. In the\r\ndepths glared the blue and red eyes of hyenas and jackals waiting for\r\ntheir turn.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the long hours of the night passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun finally rose and illuminated the jungle, groups of trees, and\r\nthe forest. The lions had disappeared before the first ray began to\r\ngleam on the horizon. Stas commanded Kali to build a fire. Mea was\r\nordered to take Nell's clothes out of the leather bag in which they\r\nwere packed, to dry them, and to dress anew the little girl as soon as\r\npossible; while Stas himself, taking his rifle, proceeded to visit the\r\ncamp and at the same time to view the devastation wrought by the storm\r\nand the two midnight assassins.\r\n\r\nImmediately beyond the zareba, of which only the pickets remained, lay\r\nthe first horse almost half devoured; about a hundred paces farther the\r\nsecond, barely touched, and immediately behind him the third,\r\ndisemboweled, and with crushed head. All presented a horrible sight;\r\ntheir eyes were open, full of settled terror, and their teeth were\r\nbared. The ground was trampled upon; in the depressions were whole\r\npuddles of blood. Stas was seized with such rage that at the moment he\r\nalmost wished that the shaggy head of a marauder, sluggish after the\r\nnocturnal feast, would emerge from some cluster of trees that he might\r\nput a bullet in him. But he had to postpone his revenge to a later time\r\nfor at present he had something else to do. It was necessary to find\r\nand capture the remaining horses. The boy assumed that they must have\r\nsought shelter in the forest, and that the same was true of Saba, whose\r\nbody was nowhere to be seen. The hope that the faithful companion in\r\nmisfortune had not fallen a victim to the predaceous beasts pleased\r\nStas so much that he gained more courage. His happiness was yet\r\naugmented by the discovery of the donkey. It appeared that the\r\nsagacious, long-eared creature did not wish to fatigue himself by a too\r\ndistant flight. He had ensconced himself outside of the zareba in a\r\ncorner formed by the white-ant hillock and the tree and there, having\r\nhis head and sides protected, had awaited developments, prepared in an\r\nemergency to repel an attack by kicking heroically with his heels. But\r\nthe lions, apparently, did not perceive him at all, so when the sun\r\nrose and danger passed away he deemed it proper to lie down and rest\r\nafter the dramatic sensations of the night.\r\n\r\nStas, strolling about the camp, finally discovered upon the softened\r\nground the imprint of horses' hoofs. The tracks led in the direction of\r\nthe forest and afterwards turned towards the ravine. This was a\r\nfavorable circumstance for the capture of the horses in the ravine did\r\nnot present any great difficulties. Between ten and twenty paces\r\nfarther he found in the grass the fetters which one of the horses had\r\nbroken in his escape. This one must have run away so far that for the\r\ntime being he must be regarded as lost. On the other hand, the two\r\nespied by Stas were behind a low rock, not in the hollow itself, but on\r\nthe brink. One of them was rolling about, while the other was cropping\r\nthe new light-green grass. Both looked unusually exhausted, as if after\r\na long journey. But the daylight had banished fear from their hearts,\r\nso they greeted Stas with a short, friendly neigh. The horse which was\r\nrolling about started to his feet. The boy observed that this one also\r\nhad freed himself from his fetters, but fortunately he apparently\r\npreferred to remain with his companion instead of running away wherever\r\nhis eyes should lead him.\r\n\r\nStas left both horses near the rock and went to the brink of the ravine\r\nto ascertain whether a farther journey by way of it was feasible. And\r\nhe saw that owing to the great declivity the water had flowed away and\r\nthe bottom was almost dry.\r\n\r\nAfter a while his attention was attracted to a white object entangled\r\nin the climbing plants in the recess of the opposite rocky wall. It\r\nappeared that it was the top of the tent which the wind had carried as\r\nfar as that and driven into the thicket so that the water could not\r\ncarry it away. The tent, at any rate, assured Nell of a better\r\nprotection than a hut hurriedly constructed of boughs; so its recovery\r\ngreatly delighted Stas.\r\n\r\nBut his joy increased still more when from a lower recess partly hidden\r\nby lianas Saba sprang out, holding in his teeth some kind of animal\r\nwhose head and tail hung from his jaws. The powerful dog, in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, reached the top, and laid at Stas' feet a striped\r\nhyena with broken back and gnawed foot. After which he began to wag his\r\ntail and bark joyfully as if he wanted to say:\r\n\r\n\"I admit that I behaved like a coward before the lions, but to tell the\r\ntruth, you sat perched on the tree like guinea-fowls. Look, however! I\r\ndid not waste the night altogether.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was so proud of himself that Stas was barely able to induce him\r\nto leave the bad-smelling animal on the spot and not to carry it as a\r\ngift to Nell.\r\n\r\nWhen they both returned a good fire was burning in the camp; water was\r\nbubbling in the utensils in which boiled durra grain, two guinea-fowls,\r\nand smoked strips of venison. Nell was already attired in a dry dress\r\nbut looked so wretched and pale that Stas became alarmed about her,\r\nand, taking her hand to ascertain whether she had a fever, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Nell, what ails you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, Stas; only I do want to sleep so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you! After such a night! Thank God, your hands are cool. Ah,\r\nwhat a night it was! No wonder you want to sleep. I do also. But don't\r\nyou feel sick?\"\r\n\r\n\"My head aches a little.\"\r\n\r\nStas placed his palm on her head. Her little head was as cold as her\r\nhands; this, however, only proved great exhaustion and weakness, so the\r\nboy sighed and said:\r\n\r\n\"Eat something warm and immediately afterwards lie down to sleep and\r\nyou will sleep until the evening. To-day, at least, the weather is fine\r\nand it will not be as it was yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Nell glanced at him with fear.\r\n\r\n\"But we will not pass the night here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not here, for there lie the gnawed remains of the horses; we will\r\nselect some other tree, or will go to the ravine and there will build a\r\nzareba such as the world has not seen. You will sleep as peacefully as\r\nin Port Said.\"\r\n\r\nBut she folded her little hands and began to beg him with tears that\r\nthey should ride farther, as in that horrible place she would not be\r\nable to close her eyes and surely would become ill. And in this way she\r\nbegged him, in this way she repeated, gazing into his eyes, \"What,\r\nStas? Well?\" so that he agreed to everything.\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall ride by way of the ravine,\" he said, \"for there is shade\r\nthere. Only promise me that if you feel weak or sick, you will tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am strong enough. Tie me to the saddle and I will sleep easily on\r\nthe road.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I shall place you on my horse and I shall hold you. Kali and Mea\r\nwill ride on the other and the donkey will carry the tent and things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well! very well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after breakfast you must take a nap. We cannot start\r\nanyway before noon. It is necessary to catch the horses, to fold the\r\ntent, to rearrange the packs. Part of the things we shall leave here\r\nfor now we have but two horses altogether. This will require a few\r\nhours and in the meantime you will sleep and refresh yourself. To-day\r\nwill be hot, but shade will not be lacking under the tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you--and Mea and Kali? I am so sorry that I alone shall sleep\r\nwhile you will be tiring yourselves--\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, we shall have time to nap. Don't worry about me. In\r\nPort Said during examination time I often did not sleep whole nights;\r\nof which my father knew nothing. My classmates also did not sleep. But\r\na man is not a little fly like you. You have no idea how you look\r\nto-day--just like glass. There remain only eyes and tufts of hair;\r\nthere is no face at all.\"\r\n\r\nHe said this jestingly, but in his soul he feared, as by the strong\r\ndaylight Nell plainly had a sickly countenance and for the first time\r\nhe clearly understood that if it continued thus the poor child not only\r\nmight, but must, die. At this thought his legs trembled for he suddenly\r\nfelt that in case of her death he would not have anything to live for,\r\nor a reason for returning to Port Said.\r\n\r\n\"For what would I then have to do?\" he thought.\r\n\r\nFor a while he turned away in order that Nell might not observe the\r\ngrief and fear in his eyes, and afterwards went to the things deposited\r\nunder the tree. He threw aside the saddle-cloth with which the\r\ncartridge box was covered, opened it, and began to search for something.\r\n\r\nHe had hidden there in a small glass bottle the last of the quinine\r\npowders and had guarded it like an \"eye in the head\" for \"the black\r\nhour,\" that is, for the emergency when Nell should be fever-stricken.\r\nBut now he was almost certain that after such a night the first attack\r\nwould come, so he determined to prevent it. He did this with a heavy\r\nheart, thinking of what would happen later, and were it not that it did\r\nnot become a man and the leader of a caravan to weep, he would have\r\nburst into tears over this last powder.\r\n\r\nSo, desiring to conceal his emotion, he assumed a very stern mien and,\r\naddressing the little girl, said:\r\n\r\n\"Nell, before you eat, take the rest of the quinine.\"\r\n\r\nShe, on the other hand, asked:\r\n\r\n\"But if you catch the fever?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will shiver. Take it, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nShe took it without further resistance, for from the time he killed the\r\nSudânese she feared him a little, notwithstanding all his efforts for\r\nher comfort and the kindness he evinced towards her. Afterwards they\r\nsat down to breakfast, and after the fatigue of the night, the hot\r\nbroth of guinea-fowl tasted delicious. Nell fell asleep immediately\r\nafter the refreshment and slept for several hours. Stas, Kali, and Mea\r\nduring that time put the caravan in order. They brought from the ravine\r\nthe top of the tent, saddled the horses, and put the packages on the\r\ndonkey and buried under the roots of the tree those things which they\r\ncould not take with them. Drowsiness terribly assailed them at the\r\nwork, and Stas, from fear that they should fall asleep, permitted\r\nhimself and them to take short naps in turn.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps two o'clock when they started on their further journey.\r\nStas held Nell before him; Kali rode with Mea on the other horse. They\r\ndid not ride at once down the ravine, but proceeded between its brink\r\nand the forest. The young jungle had grown considerably during the\r\nrainy night; the soil under it, however, was black and bore traces of\r\nfire. It was easy to surmise that Smain had passed that way with his\r\ndivision, or that the fire driven from far by a strong gale had swept\r\nover the dry jungle and, finally encountering a damp forest, had passed\r\non by a not very wide track between it and the ravine. Stas wanted to\r\nascertain whether traces of Smain's camp or imprints of hoofs could not\r\nbe found on this track; and with pleasure he became convinced that\r\nnothing resembling them could be seen. Kali, who was well versed in\r\nsuch matters, claimed positively that the fire must have been borne by\r\nthe wind and that since that time at least a fortnight must have\r\nelapsed.\r\n\r\n\"This proves,\" observed Stas, \"that Smain, with his Mahdists, is\r\nalready the Lord knows where, and in no case shall we fall into his\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards he and Nell began to gaze curiously at the vegetation, as\r\nthus far they had not ridden so close to a tropical forest. They rode\r\nnow along its very edge in order to have the shade over their heads.\r\nThe soil here was moist and soft, overgrown with dark-green grass,\r\nmoss, and ferns. Here and there lay decomposed trunks, covered as\r\nthough with a carpet of most beautiful orchids, with flowers brightly\r\ncolored like butterflies and brightly colored cups in the center of the\r\ncrown. Wherever the sun reached, the ground was gilded by other odd\r\norchids, small and yellow, in which two petals protruding on the sides\r\nof a third petal created a resemblance to the head of a little animal\r\nwith big ears ending abruptly. In some places the forest was lined with\r\nbushes of wild jasmine draped in garlands with thin, climbing plants,\r\nblooming rose-colored. The shallow hollows and depressions were\r\novergrown with ferns, compressed into one impenetrable thicket, here\r\nlow and expansive, there high, entwined with climbing plants, as though\r\ndistaffs, reaching up to the first boughs of the trees and spreading\r\nunder them in delicate green lace. In the depths there was a great\r\nvariety of trees; date, raffia, fan-palm, sycamore, bread-fruit,\r\neuphorbia, immense varieties of senna, acacia; trees with foliage dark\r\nand glittering and light or red as blood grew side by side, trunk by\r\ntrunk, with entangled branches from which shot yellow and purple\r\nflowers resembling candlesticks. In some groups the tree-tops could not\r\nbe seen as the climbing plants covered them from top to bottom, and\r\nleaping from trunk to trunk formed the letters W and M and hung in form\r\nof festoons, portières, and whole curtains. Caoutchouc lianas just\r\nstrangled the trees with thousands of serpentine tendrils and\r\ntransformed them into pyramids, buried with white flowers like snow.\r\nAbout the greater lianas the smaller entwined and the medley became so\r\nthick that it formed a wall through which neither man nor animal could\r\npenetrate. Only in places where the elephants, whose strength nothing\r\ncan resist, forced their way, were there beaten down in the thicket\r\ndeep and winding passageways, as it were.\r\n\r\nThe song of birds which so pleasantly enlivens the European forest\r\ncould not be heard at all; instead, on the tree-tops resounded the\r\nstrangest calls, similar to the sound of a saw, to the beating of a\r\ndrum, to the clatter of a stork, to the squeaking of old doors, to the\r\nclapping of hands, to caterwauling, or even to the loud, excited talk\r\nof men. From time to time soared above the trees flocks of parrots,\r\ngray, green, white, or a small bevy of gaudily plumaged toucans in a\r\nquiet, wavy flight. On the snowy background of the rubber climbing\r\nplants glimmered like sylvan sprites, little monkey-mourners, entirely\r\nblack with the exception of white tails, a white girdle on the sides,\r\nand white whiskers enveloping faces of the hue of coal.\r\n\r\nThe children gazed with admiration at this virgin forest which the eyes\r\nof a white man perhaps had never beheld. Saba every little while\r\nplunged into the thicket from which came his happy barks. The quinine,\r\nbreakfast, and sleep had revived little Nell. Her face was animated and\r\nassumed bright colors, her eyes sparkled. Every moment she asked Stas\r\nthe names of various trees and birds and he answered as well as he\r\ncould. Finally she announced that she wanted to dismount from the horse\r\nand pluck a bunch of flowers.\r\n\r\nBut the boy smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"The siafu would eat you at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a siafu? Is it worse than a lion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse and not worse. They are ants which bite terribly. There are a\r\ngreat many of them on the branches from which they fall on people's\r\nbacks like a rain of fire. But they also walk on the ground. Dismount\r\nfrom the horse and try merely to walk a little in the forest and at\r\nonce you will begin to jump and whine like a monkey. It is easier to\r\ndefend one's self against a lion. At times they move in immense ranks\r\nand then everything gives way to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And would you be able to cope with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? Of course. With the help of fire or boiling water.\"\r\n\r\n\"You always know how to take care of yourself,\" she said with deep\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nThese words flattered Stas greatly; so he replied conceitedly and at\r\nthe same time merrily:\r\n\r\n\"If you were only well, then as to the rest depend upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"My head does not even ache now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God! Thank God!\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus they passed the forest, but one flank of which reached\r\nthe hollow way. The sun was still high in the heaven and broiled\r\nintensely, as the weather cleared and in the sky not a cloud could be\r\nseen. The horses were covered with sweat and Nell began to complain of\r\nthe heat. For this reason Stas, having selected a suitable place,\r\nturned to the ravine in which the western wall cast a deep shadow. It\r\nwas cool there, and the water remaining in the depressions after the\r\ndownpour was also comparatively cool. Over the little travelers' heads\r\ncontinually flew from one brink of the ravine to the other toucans with\r\npurple heads, blue breasts and yellow wings; so the boy began to tell\r\nNell what he knew from books about their habits.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" he said, \"there are certain toucans which during the\r\nbreeding season seek hollows in trees; there the female lays eggs and\r\nsits upon them, while the male pastes the opening with clay so that\r\nonly her head is visible, and not until the young are hatched does the\r\nmale begin to peck with his long beak and free the mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what does she eat during that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"The male feeds her. He continually flies about and brings her all kind\r\nof berries.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does he permit her to sleep?\" she asked in a sleepy voice. Stas\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\"If Mrs. Toucan has the same desire that you have at this moment, then\r\nhe permits her.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, in the cold ravine an unconquerable drowsiness oppressed the\r\nlittle girl, as from morning until early in the afternoon she had\r\nrested but little. Stas had a sincere desire to follow her example, but\r\ncould not as he had to hold her, fearing that she might fall; besides,\r\nit was immensely uncomfortable for him to sit man-fashion on the flat\r\nand wide saddle which Hatim and Seki Tamala had provided for the little\r\none in Fashoda. He did not dare to move and rode the horse as slowly as\r\npossible in order not to awaken her.\r\n\r\nShe, in the meantime, leaning backwards, supported her little head upon\r\nhis shoulder and slept soundly.\r\n\r\nBut she breathed so regularly and calmly that Stas ceased to regret the\r\nlast quinine powder. He felt that danger of fever was removed and\r\ncommenced to reason thus:\r\n\r\n\"The ravine continually leads upwards and even now is quite steep. We\r\nare higher and the country is drier and drier. It is necessary only to\r\nfind some sort of elevation, well shaded, near some swift stream, and\r\nthere establish quarters and give the little one a few weeks' rest, and\r\nperhaps wait through the whole massica (the spring rainy season). Not\r\nevery girl could endure even one tenth of these hardships, but it is\r\nnecessary that she should rest! After such a night another girl would\r\nhave been stricken with fever and she--how soundly she sleeps!--Thank\r\nGod!\"\r\n\r\nAnd these thoughts brought him into a good humor; so looking down at\r\nNell's little head resting on his bosom, he said to himself merrily and\r\nat the same time with certain surprise:\r\n\r\n\"It is odd, however, how fond I am of this little fly! To tell the\r\ntruth, I always liked her, but now more and more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd not knowing how to explain such a strange symptom he came to the\r\nfollowing conclusion:\r\n\r\n\"It is because we have passed together through so much and because she\r\nis under my protection.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he held that \"fly\" very carefully with his right hand\r\naround her waist in order that she should not slip from the saddle and\r\nbruise her little nose. They advanced slowly in silence; only Kali\r\nhummed under his nose--a song in praise of Stas.\r\n\r\n\"Great master kills Gebhr, kills a lion and a buffalo! Yah! Yah! Much\r\nmeat! Much meat! Yah! Yah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali,\" Stas asked in a low tone, \"do the Wahimas hunt lions?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Wahimas fear lions but the Wahimas dig pits and if in the night\r\ntime the lion falls in, then the Wahimas laugh.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you then do?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Wahimas hurl lot of spears until lion is like a hedgehog. Then\r\nthey pull him out of the pit and eat him. Lion is good.\" And according\r\nto his habit, he stroked his stomach.\r\n\r\nStas did not like this method of hunting; so he began to ask what other\r\ngame there was in the Wahima country and they conversed further about\r\nantelopes, ostriches, giraffes, and rhinoceroses until the roar of a\r\nwaterfall reached them.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" Stas exclaimed. \"Are there a river and waterfall ahead\r\nof us?\"\r\n\r\nKali nodded his head in sign that obviously such was the fact.\r\n\r\nAnd for some time they rode more quickly, listening to the roar which\r\neach moment became more and more distinct.\r\n\r\n\"A waterfall!\" repeated Stas, whose curiosity was aroused.\r\n\r\nBut they had barely passed one or two bends when their way was barred\r\nby an impassable obstruction.\r\n\r\nNell, whom the motion of the horse had lulled to sleep, awoke at once.\r\n\r\n\"Are we already stopping for the night?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, but look! A rock closes the ravine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what shall we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to slip beside it for it is too close there; so it\r\nwill be necessary that we turn back a little, get on top, and ride\r\naround the obstruction; but it is yet two hours to night; therefore we\r\nhave plenty of time. Let us rest the horses a little. Do you hear the\r\nwaterfall?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will stop near it for the night.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which he turned to Kali, ordered him to climb to the brink of the\r\nridge and see whether, beyond, the ravine was not filled with similar\r\nobstructions; he himself began to examine the rock carefully, and after\r\na while he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"It broke off and tumbled down not long ago. Nell, do you see that\r\nfragment? Look how fresh it is. There is no moss on it, nor vegetation.\r\nI already understand, I understand!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with his hand he pointed at a baobab tree growing on the brink of\r\nthe ravine whose huge roots hung over the wall and were parallel with\r\nthe fragment.\r\n\r\n\"That root grew in a crevice between the wall and the rock, and growing\r\nstronger, it finally split the rock. That is a singular matter for\r\nstone is harder than wood; I know, however, that in mountains this\r\noften happens. After that anything can shake such a stone which barely\r\nkeeps its place, and the stone falls off.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what could shake it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is hard to say. Maybe some former storm, perhaps yesterday's.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Saba, who previously had remained behind the caravan,\r\ncame running up; he suddenly stood still as if pulled from behind by\r\nthe tail, scented; afterwards squeezed into the narrow passage between\r\nthe wall and the detached rock, but immediately began to retreat with\r\nbristling hair.\r\n\r\nStas dismounted from the horse to see what could have scared the dog.\r\n\r\n\"Stas, don't go there,\" Nell begged; \"a lion might be there.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy, who was something of a swashbuckler and who from the previous\r\nday had taken extraordinary offense at lions, replied:\r\n\r\n\"A great thing. A lion in daylight!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, before he approached the passageway, Kali's voice resounded\r\nfrom above:\r\n\r\n\"Bwana kubwa! Bwana kubwa!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\nThe negro slid down the stalk of the climbing plant in the twinkling of\r\nan eye. From his face it was easy to perceive that he brought some\r\nimportant news.\r\n\r\n\"An elephant!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\n\"An elephant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the young negro, waving his hands; \"there thundering\r\nwater, here a rock. The elephant cannot get out. Great master kill the\r\nelephant and Kali will eat him. Oh, eat, eat!\"\r\n\r\nAnd at this thought he was possessed by such joy that he began to leap,\r\nslapping his knees with his palms and laughing as if insane, in\r\naddition rolling his eyes and displaying his white teeth.\r\n\r\nStas at first did not understand why Kali said that the elephant could\r\nnot get out of the ravine. So, desiring to see what had happened, he\r\nmounted his horse and entrusting Nell to Mea in order to have his hands\r\nfree in an emergency, he ordered Kali to sit behind him; after which\r\nthey all turned back and began to seek a place by which they could\r\nreach the top. On the way Stas questioned him how the elephant got into\r\nsuch a place and from Kali's replies he ascertained more or less what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nThe elephant evidently ran before the fire by way of the ravine during\r\nthe burning of the jungle; on the way he forcibly bumped against a\r\nloosened rock, which tumbled down and cut off his retreat. After that,\r\nhaving reached the end of the hollow, he found himself on the edge of a\r\nprecipice below which a river ran, and in this manner was imprisoned.\r\n\r\nAfter a while they discovered an outlet but so steep that it was\r\nnecessary to dismount from the horses and lead them after. As the negro\r\nassured them that the river was very near they proceeded on foot. They\r\nfinally reached a promontory, bounded on one side by a river, on the\r\nother by the hollow, and glancing downward they beheld on the bottom of\r\na dell an elephant.\r\n\r\nThe huge beast was lying on its stomach and to Stas' great surprise did\r\nnot start up at the sight of them. Only when Saba came running to the\r\nbrink of the dell and began to bark furiously did he for a moment move\r\nhis enormous ears and raise his trunk, but he dropped it at once.\r\n\r\nThe children, holding hands, gazed long at him in silence, which\r\nfinally was broken by Kali.\r\n\r\n\"He is dying of hunger,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe elephant was really so emaciated that his spine protruded, his\r\nsides were shrunken, his ribs were distinctly outlined notwithstanding\r\nthe thickness of his hide, and it was easy to conjecture that he did\r\nnot rise because he did not now have sufficient strength.\r\n\r\nThe ravine, which was quite wide at its opening, changed into a dell,\r\nlocked in on two sides by perpendicular rocks, and on its bottom a few\r\ntrees grew. These trees were broken; their bark was peeled and on the\r\nbranches there was not a leaf. The climbing plants hanging from the\r\nrocks were torn to pieces and gnawed, and the grass in the dell was\r\ncropped to the last blade.\r\n\r\nStas, examining the situation thoroughly, began to share his\r\nobservations with Nell, but being impressed with the inevitable death\r\nof the huge beast he spoke in a low tone as if he feared to disturb the\r\nlast moments of its life.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he really is dying of starvation. He certainly has been confined\r\nhere at least two weeks, that is, from the time when the old jungle was\r\nburnt. He ate everything that there was to eat and now is enduring\r\ntorments; particularly as, here above, bread-fruit trees and acacias\r\nwith great pods are growing, and he sees them but cannot reach them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd for a while they again gazed in silence. The elephant from time to\r\ntime turned towards them his small, languid eyes and something in the\r\nnature of a gurgle escaped from his throat.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" the boy declared, \"it is best to cut short his pangs.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he raised the rifle to his face, but Nell clutched his\r\njacket and, braced upon both of her little feet, began to pull him with\r\nall her strength away from the brink of the hollow.\r\n\r\n\"Stas! Don't do that! Stas, let us give him something to eat! He is so\r\nwretched! I don't want you to kill him! I don't want it! I don't!\"\r\n\r\nAnd stamping with her little feet, she did not cease pulling him, and\r\nhe looked at her with great astonishment and, seeing her eyes filled\r\nwith tears, said:\r\n\r\n\"But, Nell!--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want it. I won't let him be killed! I shall get the fever if\r\nyou kill him.\"\r\n\r\nFor Stas this threat was sufficient to make him forego his murderous\r\ndesign in regard to the elephant before them and in regard to anything\r\nelse in the world. For a time he was silent, not knowing what reply to\r\nmake to the little one, after which he said:\r\n\r\n\"Very well! very well! I tell you it is all right! Nell, let go of me!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Nell at once hugged him and through her tear-dimmed eyes a smile\r\ngleamed. Now she was concerned only about giving the elephant something\r\nto eat as quickly as possible. Kali and Mea were greatly astonished\r\nwhen they learned that the Bwana kubwa not only would not kill the\r\nelephant, but that they were to pluck at once as many melons from the\r\nbread-fruit trees, as many acacia pods, and as much of all kinds of\r\nweeds as they were able. Gebhr's two-edged Sudânese sword was of great\r\nuse to Kali at this labor, and were it not for that the work would not\r\nhave proceeded so easily. Nell, however, did not want to wait for its\r\ncompletion and when the first melon fell from the tree she seized it\r\nwith both her hands and, carrying it to the ravine, she repeated\r\nrapidly as if from fear that some one else might want to supplant her:\r\n\r\n\"I! I! I!\"\r\n\r\nBut Stas did not in the least think of depriving her of this pleasure,\r\nbut from fear that through too much zeal she might fall over with the\r\nmelon, he seized her by the belt and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Throw!\"\r\n\r\nThe huge fruit rolled over the steep declivity and fell close to the\r\nelephant's feet, while the latter in the twinkling of an eye stretched\r\nout his trunk and seized it; afterwards he bent his trunk as if he\r\nwanted to place the melon under his throat and this much the children\r\nsaw of him.\r\n\r\n\"He ate it!\" exclaimed the happy girl.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so,\" answered Stas, laughing.\r\n\r\nAnd the elephant stretched out his trunk towards them as if he wanted\r\nto beg for more and emitted in a powerful tone:\r\n\r\n\"Hruumf!\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants more!\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so!\" repeated Stas.\r\n\r\nThe second melon followed in the track of the first and in the same\r\nmanner afterwards disappeared in a moment a third, fourth, tenth; later\r\nacacia pods and whole bundles of grass and great leaves began to fly\r\ndown. Nell did not allow any one to take her place, and when her little\r\nhands grew tired from the work, she shoved new supplies with her little\r\nfeet; while the elephant ate and, raising his trunk, from time to time\r\ntrumpeted his thunderous \"hruumf\" as a sign that he wanted to eat still\r\nmore, but Nell claimed that it was a sign of gratitude.\r\n\r\nBut Kali and Mea finally were fatigued with the work which they\r\nperformed with great alacrity under the impression that Bwana kubwa\r\nwanted first to fatten the elephant and afterwards to kill him. At\r\nlast, however, Bwana kubwa ordered them to stop, as the sun was setting\r\nand it was time to start the construction of the zareba. Fortunately\r\nthis was not a difficult matter, for two sides of the triangular\r\npromontory were utterly inaccessible, so that it was necessary only to\r\nfence in the third. Acacias with big thorns also were not lacking.\r\n\r\nNell did not retire a step from the ravine and, squatting upon its\r\nbrink, announced from a distance to Stas what the elephant was doing.\r\nAt frequent intervals her thin little voice resounded:\r\n\r\n\"He is searching about with his trunk!\"\r\n\r\nOr: \"He is moving his ears. What big ears he has!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stas! Stas! He is getting up! Oh!\"\r\n\r\nStas approached hurriedly and seized Nell's hand.\r\n\r\nThe elephant actually rose, and now the children could observe his\r\nimmense size. They had previously seen huge elephants which were\r\ncarried on vessels through the Suez Canal bound from India to Europe,\r\nbut not one of them could compare with this colossus, who actually\r\nlooked like a huge slate-colored rock walking on four feet. He differed\r\nfrom the others in the size of his tusks which reached five or more\r\nfeet and, as Nell already observed, his ears, which were of fabulous\r\nproportions. His fore legs were high but comparatively thin, which was\r\nundoubtedly due to the fast of many days.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is a Lilliputian!\" laughed Stas. \"If he should rear himself\r\nand stretch out his trunk, he might catch you by the feet.\"\r\n\r\nBut the colossus did not think of rearing or catching any one by the\r\nfeet. With an unsteady gait he approached the egress of the ravine,\r\ngazed for a while over the precipice, at the bottom of which water was\r\nseething; afterwards he turned to the wall close to the waterfall,\r\ndirected his trunk towards it, and, having immersed it as best he\r\ncould, began to drink.\r\n\r\n\"It is his good fortune,\" Stas said, \"that he can reach the water with\r\nhis trunk. Otherwise he would have died.\"\r\n\r\nThe elephant drank so long that finally the little girl became alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Stas, won't he harm himself?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he replied, laughing, \"but since you have taken him\r\nunder your care, warn him now.\"\r\n\r\nSo Nell leaned over the edge and cried:\r\n\r\n\"Enough, dear elephant, enough!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dear elephant, as if he understood what was the matter, stopped\r\ndrinking at once, and instead, began to splash water over himself.\r\nFirst he splashed water on his feet, then on his back, and afterwards\r\non both sides.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime it grew dark; so Stas conducted the little girl to\r\nthe zareba where supper already awaited them.\r\n\r\nBoth were in excellent humor--Nell because she had saved the elephant's\r\nlife and Stas because he saw her eyes sparkling like two stars and her\r\ngladdened face which was ruddier and healthier than it had been at any\r\ntime since their departure from Khartûm. A promise of a quiet and\r\nperfect night also conduced to the boy's contentment. The two\r\ninaccessible sides of the promontory absolutely secured them from\r\nattacks from those directions, and on the third side Kali and Mea\r\nreared so high a wall of thorny branches of acacias and of passion\r\nflowers that there could be no thought of any predacious beasts being\r\nable to surmount such a barrier. In addition the weather was fine and\r\nthe heavens immediately after sunset were studded with countless stars.\r\nThe air, which was cool, owing to the proximity of the waterfall, and\r\nwhich was saturated with the odor of the jungle and newly broken\r\nbranches, was agreeable to breathe.\r\n\r\n\"This fly will not get the fever here,\" Stas thought joyfully.\r\n\r\nAfterwards they commenced to converse about the elephant, as Nell was\r\nincapable of talking of anything else and did not cease going into\r\ntransports over his stature, trunk, and tusks, which in reality were\r\nprodigious. Finally she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Honestly, Stas, isn't he wise?\"\r\n\r\n\"As Solomon,\" answered Stas. \"But what makes you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because when I asked him not to drink any more, he obeyed me at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"If before that time he had not taken any lessons in English and\r\nnevertheless understands it, that really is miraculous.\"\r\n\r\nNell perceived that Stas was making merry with her, so she gave him a\r\nscolding; after which she said:\r\n\r\n\"Say what you wish, but I am sure that he is very intelligent and will\r\nbecome tame at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether at once I don't know, but he may be tamed. The African\r\nelephants are indeed more savage than the Asiatic; nevertheless, I\r\nthink that Hannibal, for instance, used African elephants.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who was Hannibal?\"\r\n\r\nStas glanced at her indulgently and with pity.\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" he said, \"at your age, you are not supposed to know such\r\nthings. Hannibal was a great Carthaginian commander, who used elephants\r\nin his war with the Romans, and as Carthage was in Africa, he must have\r\nused African--\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the resounding roar of the\r\nelephant, who, having eaten and drunk his fill, began to trumpet; it\r\ncould not be known whether from joy or from longing for complete\r\nfreedom. Saba started up and began to bark, while Stas said:\r\n\r\n\"There you have it! Now he is calling companions. We will be in a nice\r\npredicament if he attracts a whole herd here.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will tell them that we were kind to him,\" Nell responded hastily.\r\n\r\nBut Stas, who indeed was not alarmed, as he reckoned that even if a\r\nherd should rush towards them, the glare of the fire would frighten\r\nthem away, smiled spitefully and said:\r\n\r\n\"Very well! very well! But if the elephants appear, you won't cry, oh\r\nno! Your eyes will only perspire as they did twice before.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to tease her:\r\n\r\n\"I do not cry, only my eyes perspire--\"\r\n\r\nNell, however, seeing his happy mien, conjectured that no immediate\r\ndanger threatened them.\r\n\r\n\"When he gets tame,\" she said, \"my eyes will not perspire, though ten\r\nlions should roar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"For he will defend us.\"\r\n\r\nStas quieted Saba, who would not stop replying to the elephant; after\r\nwhich he deliberated somewhat and spoke thus:\r\n\r\n\"You did not think of one thing, Nell. Of course, we will not stay here\r\nfor ages but will proceed farther; I do not say at once. On the\r\ncontrary, the place is good and healthy; I have decided to stop here--a\r\nweek, perhaps,--perhaps two, for you, and all of us as well, are\r\nentitled to a rest. Well, very good! As long as we stay here we will\r\nfeed the elephant, though that will be a big task for us all. But he is\r\nlocked up and we cannot take him with us. Well then, what later? We\r\nshall go and he will remain here and again will endure the pangs of\r\nhunger until he dies. Then we shall be all the more sorry for him.\"\r\n\r\nNell saddened very much and for some time sat in silence, evidently not\r\nknowing what reply to make to these just remarks, but after a while she\r\nraised her head and, brushing aside the tufts of hair which fell over\r\nher eyes, turned her gaze, full of confidence, on the boy.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she said, \"that if you want to, you will get him out of the\r\nravine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she stretched out her little finger, touched Stas' hand with it,\r\nand repeated:\r\n\r\n\"You.\"\r\n\r\nThe sly little woman understood that her confidence would flatter the\r\nboy and from that moment he would ponder on how to free the elephant.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night passed quietly and though, on the southern side of the sky,\r\nbig clouds gathered, the morning was beautiful. By Stas' orders, Kali\r\nand Mea, immediately after breakfast, began to gather melons and acacia\r\npods as well as fresh leaves and all kinds of fodder, which they\r\ndeposited upon the brink of the ravine.\r\n\r\nAs Nell firmly insisted upon feeding her new friend herself, Stas cut\r\nfor her from a young bifurcated fig tree something in the shape of a\r\npitchfork in order to make it easier for her to shove down the supplies\r\nto the bottom of the ravine. The elephant trumpeted from morn,\r\nevidently calling for his refreshments, and when afterwards he beheld\r\non the brink that same little white being who had fed him the previous\r\nday, he greeted her with a joyful gurgle and at once stretched out his\r\ntrunk towards her. In the morning light he appeared to the children\r\nstill more prodigious than on the preceding day. He was lean but\r\nalready looked brisker and turned his small eyes almost joyfully on\r\nNell. Nell even claimed that his fore legs had grown thicker during the\r\nnight, and began to shove fodder with such zeal that Stas had to\r\nrestrain her and in the end when she got out of breath too much, take\r\nher place at the work. Both enjoyed themselves immensely; the\r\nelephant's \"whims\" amused them especially. In the beginning he ate\r\neverything which fell at his feet, but soon, having satisfied the first\r\ncravings of hunger, he began to grow fastidious. Chancing upon a plant\r\nwhich was not to his taste, he beat it over his fore leg and afterwards\r\ntossed it upwards with his trunk, as if he wanted to say, \"Eat this\r\ndainty yourselves;\" finally, after having appeased his hunger and\r\nthirst, he began to fan with his prodigious ears with evident\r\ncontentment.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure,\" said Nell, \"that if we went down to him he would not hurt\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she began to call to him:\r\n\r\n\"Elephant, dear elephant, isn't it true you would not do any harm to\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\nAnd when the elephant nodded his trunk in reply she turned to Stas:\r\n\r\n\"There, you see he says 'Yes.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" Stas replied. \"Elephants are very intelligent animals\r\nand this one undoubtedly understands that we both are necessary to him.\r\nWho knows whether he does not feel a little gratitude towards us? But\r\nit would be better not to try yet, and particularly not to let Saba\r\ntry, as the elephant surely would kill him. But with time they become\r\neven friendly.\"\r\n\r\nFurther transports over the elephant were interrupted by Kali who,\r\nforeseeing that he should have to work every day to feed the gigantic\r\nbeast, approached Stas with an ingratiating smile and said:\r\n\r\n\"Great master, kill the elephant, and Kali will eat him instead of\r\ngathering grass and branches.\"\r\n\r\nBut the \"great master\" was now a hundred miles from a desire to kill\r\nthe elephant and, as in addition he was impulsive, he retorted:\r\n\r\n\"You are a donkey.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately he forgot the Kiswahili word for donkey and said it in\r\nEnglish. Kali, not understanding English, evidently took it for some\r\nkind of compliment or praise for himself, as a moment later the\r\nchildren heard how he, addressing Mea, boastfully said:\r\n\r\n\"Mea has a dark skin and dark brain, but Kali is a donkey.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which he added with pride:\r\n\r\n\"The great master himself said that Kali is a donkey.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Stas, ordering both to tend the little lady as the eye\r\nin the head and in case of any accident to summon him at once, took the\r\nrifle and went to the detached rock which blocked the ravine. Arriving\r\nat the place he inspected if attentively, examined all its cracks,\r\ninserted a stick into a crevice which he found near the bottom, and\r\ncarefully measured its depths; afterwards he returned slowly to the\r\ncamp and, opening the cartridge box, began to count the cartridges.\r\n\r\nHe had barely counted three hundred when from a baobab tree growing\r\nabout fifty paces from the tent Mea's voice resounded.\r\n\r\n\"Master! Master!\"\r\n\r\nStas approached the giant tree, whose trunk, hollowed through decay\r\nnear the ground, looked like a tower, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not far away can be seen zebras, and further on antelopes are feeding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! I will take a rifle and go, for it is necessary to cure meat.\r\nBut why did you climb the tree, and what are you doing there?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl answered in her sad, melodious voice:\r\n\r\n\"Mea saw a nest of gray parrots and wanted to bring a young one to the\r\nlittle lady, but the nest is empty, so Mea will not get any beads for\r\nher neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will get them because you love the little lady.\"\r\n\r\nThe young negress came down the rugged bark as quickly as possible, and\r\nwith eyes glistening with joy began to repeat:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Yes! Yes! Mea loves her very much--and beads also.\"\r\n\r\nStas gently stroked her head, after which he took the rifle, closed the\r\ncartridge box, and started in the direction in which the zebras were\r\npastured. After a half hour the report of a shot reached the camp, and\r\nan hour later the young hunter returned with the good news that he had\r\nkilled a young zebra and that the locality was full of game; that he\r\nsaw from a height besides zebras, a numerous herd of ariel antelopes as\r\nwell as a group of water-bucks pasturing in the vicinity of the river.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he ordered Kali to take a horse, and despatched him for the\r\nslaughtered game, while he himself began to inspect carefully the\r\ngigantic baobab trunk, walk around it, and knock the rugged bark with\r\nthe barrel of his rifle.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Nell asked him. He replied:\r\n\r\n\"Look what a giant! Fifteen men holding each other's hands could not\r\nencircle that tree, which perhaps remembers the times of the Pharaohs.\r\nBut the trunk at the bottom is decayed and hollow. Do you see that\r\nopening? Through it one can easily reach the middle. We can there\r\narrange a room in which we all can live. This occurred to me when I saw\r\nMea among the branches, and afterwards when I stalked the zebra I was\r\ncontinually thinking of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we are to escape to Abyssinia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Nevertheless it is necessary to recuperate, and I told you\r\nyesterday that I had decided to remain here a week, or even two. You do\r\nnot want to leave your elephant, and I fear for you during the rainy\r\nseason, which has already commenced and during which fever is certain.\r\nTo-day the weather is fine; you see, however, that the clouds are\r\ngathering thicker and thicker and who knows whether it will not pour\r\nbefore night? The tent will not protect you sufficiently and in the\r\nbaobab tree if it is not rotten to the top, we can laugh at the\r\ngreatest downpour. It will be also safer in it than in the tent for if\r\nin the evening we protect this opening with thorns and make a little\r\nwindow to afford us light, then as many lions as want to may roar and\r\nhover around. The spring rainy season does not last longer than a month\r\nand I am more and more inclined to think that it will be necessary to\r\nwait through it. And if so, it is better here than elsewhere, and\r\nbetter still in that gigantic tree than under the tent.\"\r\n\r\nNell always agreed to everything that Stas wanted; so she agreed now;\r\nthe more so, as the thought of remaining near the elephant and dwelling\r\nin a baobab tree pleased her immensely. She began now to think of how\r\nshe would arrange the rooms, how she would furnish them, and how they\r\nwould invite each other to \"five o'clocks\" and dinners. In the end they\r\nboth were amused greatly and Nell wanted at once to inspect her new\r\ndwelling, but Stas, who with each day acquired more experience and\r\nprudence, restrained her from too sudden housekeeping.\r\n\r\n\"Before we live there,\" he said, \"it is first necessary to bid the\r\npresent tenants to move out, if any such are found there.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he ordered Mea to throw into the interior of the baobab\r\ntree a few lighted boughs, which smoked profusely because the branches\r\nwere fresh.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it appeared that he did well as the gigantic tree was occupied\r\nby housekeepers upon whose hospitality no reliance could be placed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two apertures in the tree, one large, about a half a yard\r\nfrom the ground; the other smaller, and about as high as the first\r\nstory of a city residence. Mea had scarcely thrown the lighted, smoking\r\nbranches into the lower one when immediately out of the upper one big\r\nbats began to fly; squeaking and blinded by the luster of the sun, they\r\nflew aimlessly about the tree. But after a while from the lower opening\r\nthere stole out, like lightning, a real tenant, in the person of a\r\nmonstrous boa, who evidently, digesting the remnants of the last feast\r\nin a semi-somnolent state, had not become aroused and did not think of\r\nsafety until the smoke curled in his nostrils. At the sight of the\r\nstrong body, which, like a monstrous spring, darted out of the smoking\r\ninterior of the tree, Stas grabbed Nell in his arms and began to run\r\nwith her in the direction of the open jungle. But the reptile, itself\r\nterror-stricken, did not think of pursuing them; instead, winding in\r\nthe grass and among the scattered packages, it slid away with\r\nunheard-of speed in the direction of the ravine, seeking to hide amid\r\nthe rocky fissures and crannies. The children recovered their\r\ncomposure. Stas placed Nell on the ground and rushed for his rifle, and\r\nafterwards pursued the snake in the direction of the ravine, Nell\r\nfollowing him. But after going a score of paces such an extraordinary\r\nspectacle struck their eyes that they stood still as if thunderstruck.\r\nNow high above the ravine appeared in the twinkling of an eye the body\r\nof the snake, and, describing a zigzag in the air, it fell again to the\r\nbottom. After a while it appeared a second time and again fell. The\r\nchildren, reaching the brink, saw with amazement that their new friend,\r\nthe elephant, was amusing himself in this manner, for having first\r\ndespatched the snake twice upon an aerial journey, at present he was\r\ncrushing its head with his prodigious foot which resembled a log.\r\nHaving finished this operation, he again lifted the still quivering\r\nbody with his trunk; this time, however, he did not toss it upwards,\r\nbut directly into the waterfall. After this, nodding both ways and\r\nfanning himself with his ears, he began to gaze keenly at Nell, and\r\nfinally stretched out his trunk towards her as if claiming a reward for\r\nhis heroic and, at the same time, sensible deed.\r\n\r\nNell ran at once to the tent and returning with a box full of wild\r\nfigs, began to throw a few at a time to him, while he searched for them\r\nin the grass and placed one after another in his mouth. Those which\r\nfell in deeper crevices, he blew out with such force that, with the\r\nfigs, stones the size of a man's fist flew up. The children received\r\nthis exhibition with applause and laughter. Nell went back several\r\ntimes for new supplies, not ceasing to contend with each fig that the\r\nelephant was entirely tamed and that they could even at that moment go\r\ndown to him.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Stas; we now shall have a defender. For he is afraid of\r\nnobody in the desert--neither lion, nor snake, nor crocodile. And he is\r\nvery good and surely loves us.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he is tamed,\" said Stas, \"and if I can leave you under his care,\r\nthen really I can go hunting in perfect peace, for a better defender\r\nfor you I could not find in all Africa.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while he added:\r\n\r\n\"The elephants of this place are wild, but I have read that Asiatic\r\nelephants, for instance, have a strange weakness for children. It has\r\nnever occurred in India that an elephant has harmed a child, and if one\r\nfalls in a rage, as sometimes happens, the native keepers send children\r\nto pacify him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you see! You see!\"\r\n\r\n\"In any case you did well in not allowing me to kill him.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Nell's pupils flashed with joy like two little greenish flames.\r\nStanding on tiptoe, she placed both her hands on Stas' shoulders and,\r\ntilting her head backward, asked, gazing into his eyes:\r\n\r\n\"I acted as if I had how many years? Tell me! As if I had how many\r\nyears?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he replied:\r\n\r\n\"At least seventy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are always joking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get angry, get angry, but who will free the elephant?\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, Nell began at once to fawn like a little kitten.\r\n\r\n\"You--and I shall love you very much and he will also.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking of that,\" Stas said, \"but it will be hard work and I\r\nshall not do it at once, but only when we are ready to start upon a\r\nfarther journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because if we should free him before he is entirely tame and becomes\r\nattached to us, he would go away at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! He won't go away from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think that he already is like me,\" retorted Stas with impatience.\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was checked by the arrival of Kali, who brought\r\nwith him the slain zebra and its colt, which had been partly devoured\r\nby Saba. It was the good fortune of the mastiff that he rushed after\r\nKali, and was not present at the encounter with the python for he would\r\nhave chased after him and, overtaking him, would have perished in his\r\nmurderous coils before Stas could come to his aid. For eating the zebra\r\nhe received, however, from Nell a tongue-lashing which after all he did\r\nnot take too much to heart as he did not even hide his lolling tongue,\r\nwith which he came running in from the hunt.\r\n\r\nStas announced in the meantime to Kali that he intended to arrange a\r\ndwelling in the interior of the tree and related to him what had\r\noccurred during the smoking out of the trunk, as well as how the\r\nelephant had handled the snake. The idea of living in the baobab tree,\r\nwhich would afford a protection not only against the rain but also\r\nagainst the wild animals, pleased the negro very much; but on the other\r\nhand the conduct of the elephant did not meet his approval.\r\n\r\n\"The elephant is foolish,\" he said, \"so he threw the nioka (snake) into\r\nthe thundering water, but Kali knows that nioka is good; so he will\r\nsearch for it in the thundering waters, and bake it as Kali is\r\nwise--and is a donkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is agreed that you are a donkey,\" Stas answered, \"but of course you\r\nwill not eat the snake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nioka is good,\" repeated Kali. And pointing at the slain zebra, he\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"Better than that niama.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which both went into the baobab tree and occupied themselves in\r\narranging the dwelling. Kali, having found on the river-side a flat\r\nstone the size of a sieve, placed it in the trunk, heaped burning coals\r\nupon it, and afterwards continually added more fuel, watching only that\r\nthe decayed wood on the inside did not ignite and cause the\r\nconflagration of the whole tree. He said that he did this in order that\r\n\"nothing should bite the great master and the bibi.\" In fact it\r\nappeared that this was not a useless precaution, for as soon as smoke\r\nfilled the interior of the tree and spread even on the outside there\r\nbegan to creep out of the cracks in the bark a great variety of\r\ncreatures; scarabees, black and cherry-colored, shaggy spiders big as\r\nplums, caterpillars of the thickness of a finger, covered as though\r\nwith thorns, and loathsome and at the same time venomous scolopendras\r\nwhose bite may even cause death. In view of what was occurring on the\r\noutside of the trunk it was easy to surmise how many similar creatures\r\nmust have perished from the fumes of the smoke on the inside. Those\r\nwhich fell from the bark and lower branches upon the grass were crushed\r\nunmercifully with a stone by Kali, who was continually gazing at the\r\nupper and lower openings as if he feared that at any moment something\r\nstrange might appear in either of them.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you looking so?\" Stas asked. \"Do you think that another snake\r\nis hiding in the tree?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Kali fears Mzimu!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a Mzimu?\"\r\n\r\n\"An evil spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever in your life see a Mzimu?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but Kali has heard the horrible noise which Mzimu makes in the\r\nhuts of fetish-men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless your fetish-men do not fear him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fetish-men know how to exorcise him, and afterwards go to the huts\r\nand say that Mzimu is angry; so the negroes bring them bananas, honey,\r\npombe (beer made of sorghum plant), eggs, and meat in order to\r\npropitiate the Mzimu.\"\r\n\r\nStas shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I see that it is a good thing to be a fetish-man among your people.\r\nPerhaps that snake was Mzimu?\"\r\n\r\nKali shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"In such case the elephant could not kill the Mzimu, but the Mzimu\r\nwould kill the elephant. Mzimu is death.\"\r\n\r\nSome kind of strange crash and rumble within the tree suddenly\r\ninterrupted his reply. From the lower aperture there burst out a\r\nstrange ruddy dust, after which there resounded a second crash, louder\r\nthan the former one.\r\n\r\nKali threw himself in the twinkling of an eye upon his face and began\r\nto cry shrilly:\r\n\r\n\"Aka! Mzimu! Aka! Aka! Aka!\"\r\n\r\nStas at first stepped back, but soon recovered his composure, and when\r\nNell with Mea came running up he began to explain what might have\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\"In all probability,\" he said, \"a whole mass of decayed wood in the\r\ninterior of the trunk, expanding from the heat, finally tumbled down\r\nand buried the burning wood. And he thinks that it was Mzimu. Let Mea,\r\nhowever, pour water a few times through the opening; if the live embers\r\nare not extinct for want of air and the decayed wood is kindled, the\r\ntree might be consumed by fire.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which, seeing that Kali continued lying down and did not cease\r\nrepeating with terror, \"Aka! Aka!\" he took the rifle with which he\r\nusually shot at guinea-fowl and, firing into the opening, said, shoving\r\nthe boy with the barrel:\r\n\r\n\"Your Mzimu is killed. Do not fear.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Kali raised his body, but remained on his knees.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, great master! great! You do not even fear Mzimu!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aka! Aka!\" exclaimed Stas, mimicking the negro.\r\n\r\nAnd he began to laugh.\r\n\r\nThe negro became calm after a time and when he sat down to partake of\r\nthe food prepared by Mea, it appeared that the temporary fright had not\r\nat all deprived him of his appetite, for besides a portion of smoked\r\nmeat he consumed the raw liver of the zebra colt, not counting the wild\r\nfigs, which a sycamore growing in the neighborhood furnished in great\r\nabundance. Afterwards with Stas they returned to the tree, about which\r\nthere was yet a good deal of work to do. The removal of the decayed\r\nwood and the ashes, with hundreds of broiled scarabees and centipedes,\r\ntogether with a score of baked bats occupied over two hours' time. Stas\r\nwas also surprised that the bats could live in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of the snake. He surmised, however, that the gigantic\r\npython either despised such trifling game or, not being able to wind\r\nhimself around anything in the interior of the trunk, could not reach\r\nthem. The glowing coals, having caused the fall of layers of decayed\r\nwood, cleaned out the interior splendidly, and its appearance delighted\r\nStas, for it was as wide as a large room and could have given shelter\r\nnot merely to four persons, but to ten men. The lower opening formed a\r\ndoorway and the upper a window, thanks to which in the huge trunk it\r\nwas neither dark nor stifling. Stas thought of dividing the whole, by\r\nmeans of the tent canvas, into two rooms, of which one was to be\r\nassigned to Nell and Mea and the other to himself, Kali, and Saba. The\r\ntree was not decayed to the top of the trunk; the rain, therefore,\r\ncould not leak to the center, but in order to be protected completely,\r\nit was sufficient to raise and prop bark above both openings in such\r\nmanner that it should form two eaves. The bottom of the interior he\r\ndetermined to strew with sand from the river bank which had been\r\ngrilled by the sun, and to carpet its surface with dry moss.\r\n\r\nThe work was really hard, especially for Kali, for he had, in addition,\r\nto cure the meat, water the horses, and think of fodder for the\r\nelephant who was incessantly trumpeting for it. But the young negro\r\nproceeded to work about the new abode with great willingness and even\r\nardor; the reason for this he explained the same day to Stas in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n\"When the great master and the 'bibi,'\" he said, holding his arms\r\nakimbo, \"live in the tree, Kali will not have to build big zarebas for\r\nthe night and he can be idle every night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you like to be idle?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"Kali is a man, so Kali loves to be idle, as only women ought to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you see, however, that I work for the 'bibi.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But because when the 'bibi' grows up she will have to work for the\r\ngreat master, and, if she does not want to, the great master will whip\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nBut Stas, at the very thought of whipping the \"bibi,\" jumped as if\r\nscalded and shouted in anger:\r\n\r\n\"Fool, do you know who the 'bibi' is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not,\" replied the black boy with fear.\r\n\r\n\"Bibi--is--is--a good Mzimu.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Kali cowered.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing his work he approached Nell bashfully; then he fell on\r\nhis face and began to repeat, not indeed in a terror-stricken, but in\r\nan entreating voice:\r\n\r\n\"Aka! Aka! Aka!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the \"Good Mzimu\" stared at him, with her beautiful, sea-green eyes\r\nwide open, not understanding what had happened nor what was the matter\r\nwith Kali.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new abode, which Stas named \"Cracow,\" was completed in the course\r\nof three days. But before that time the principal luggage was deposited\r\nin the \"men's quarters\" and during great downpours the young quartette\r\nstaid in the gigantic trunk, perfectly sheltered. The rainy season\r\nbegan in earnest but it was not one of our long autumn rains during\r\nwhich the heavens are heavy with dark clouds and the tedious, vexatious\r\nbad weather lasts for weeks. There, about a dozen times during the day,\r\nthe wind drives over the sky the swollen clouds, which water the earth\r\ncopiously, after which the sun shines brightly, as if freshly bathed,\r\nand floods with a golden luster the rocks, the river, the trees, and\r\nthe entire jungle. The grass grew almost before their eyes. The trees\r\nwere clad with more abundant leaves, and, before the old fruit fell,\r\nbuds of the new germinated. The air, owing to the tiny drops of water\r\nsuspended in it, grew so transparent that even distant objects became\r\nentirely distinct and the view extended into the immeasurably far\r\nexpanse. On the sky hung charming, seven-colored rainbows and the\r\nwaterfall was almost continually attired with them. The brief dawn and\r\ntwilight played with thousands of lights of such brilliance that the\r\nchildren had not seen anything like it, even on the Libyan Desert. The\r\nlower clouds, those nearest the earth, were dyed cherry-colored, the\r\nupper, better illuminated, overflowed in the shape of a lake of purple\r\nand gold, and the tiny woolly cloudlets changed colors like rubies,\r\namethysts, and opals. During the night time, between one downpour of\r\nrain and another, the moon transformed into diamonds the drops of dew\r\nwhich clung on the mimosa and acacia leaves, and the zodiacal light\r\nshone in the refreshed transparent air more brightly than at any other\r\nseason of the year.\r\n\r\nFrom the overflow which the river formed below the waterfall came the\r\nuneasy croaking of frogs and the doleful piping of toads, and\r\nfireflies, resembling shooting stars, flew from bank to bank amid the\r\nclumps of bamboo and arum.\r\n\r\nBut when clouds covered the starry heaven and the rain began to fall it\r\nbecame very dusky and the interior of the baobab tree was as dark as in\r\na cellar. Desiring to avoid this, Stas ordered Mea to melt the fat of\r\nthe killed game and make a lamp of a small plate, which he placed\r\nbeneath the upper opening, which was called a window by the children.\r\nThe light from this window, visible from a distance in the darkness,\r\ndrove away the wild animals, but on the other hand attracted bats and\r\neven birds so much that Kali finally was compelled to construct in the\r\nopening something in the nature of a screen of thorns similar to the\r\none with which he closed the lower opening for the night.\r\n\r\nHowever, in daytime, during fair weather, the children left \"Cracow\"\r\nand strolled over the promontory. Stas started after antelope-ariels\r\nand ostriches, of which numerous flocks appeared near the river below,\r\nwhile Nell went to her elephant, who in the beginning trumpeted only\r\nfor food and later trumpeted when he felt lonesome without his little\r\nfriend. He always greeted her with sheer delight and pricked his\r\nenormous ears as soon as he heard from the distance her voice or her\r\nfootsteps.\r\n\r\nOnce, when Stas went hunting and Kali angled for fish beyond the\r\nwaterfall, Nell decided to go to the rock which closed the ravine, to\r\nsee whether Stas had done anything about its removal. Mea, occupied\r\nwith preparations for dinner, did not observe her departure; while on\r\nthe way, the little maid, gathering flowers, particularly begonia which\r\ngrew abundantly in the rocky clefts, approached the declivity by which\r\nthey at one time left the ravine and descending found herself near the\r\nrock. The great stone, detached from its native walls, obstructed the\r\nravine as it had previously done. Nell, however, noticed that between\r\nthe rock and the wall there was a passage so wide that even a grown-up\r\nperson could pass through it with ease. For a while she hesitated, then\r\nshe went in and found herself on the other side. But there was a bend\r\nthere, which it was necessary to pass in order to reach the wide egress\r\nof the locked-in waterfall. Nell began to meditate. \"I will go yet a\r\nlittle farther. I will peer from behind the rocks; I will take just one\r\nlook at the elephant who will not see me at all, and I will return.\"\r\nThus meditating, she advanced step by step farther and farther, until\r\nfinally she reached a place where the ravine widened suddenly into a\r\nsmall dell and she saw the elephant. He stood with his back turned\r\ntowards her, with trunk immersed in the waterfall, and drank. This\r\nemboldened her, so pressing closely to the wall, she advanced a few\r\nsteps, and a few more yet, and then the huge beast, desiring to splash\r\nhis sides, turned his head, saw the little maid, and, beholding her,\r\nmoved at once towards her.\r\n\r\nNell became very much frightened, but as there was no time now for\r\nretreat, pressing knee to knee, she curtsied to the elephant as best\r\nshe could; after which she stretched out her little hand with the\r\nbegonias and spoke in a slightly quivering voice.\r\n\r\n\"Good day, dear elephant. I know you won't harm me; so I came to say\r\ngood day--and I have only these flowers--\"\r\n\r\nAnd the colossus approached, stretched out his trunk, and picked the\r\nbunch of begonias out of Nell's little fingers, and putting them into\r\nhis mouth he dropped them at once as evidently neither the rough leaves\r\nnor the flowers were to his taste. Nell now saw above her the trunk\r\nlike a huge black snake which stretched and bent; it touched one of her\r\nlittle hands and then the other; afterwards both shoulders and finally\r\ndescending it began to swing gently to and fro.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that you would not harm me,\" the little girl repeated, though\r\nfear did not leave her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the elephant drew back his fabulous ears, winding and\r\nunwinding alternately his trunk and gurgling joyfully as he always\r\ngurgled when the little girl approached the brink of the ravine.\r\n\r\nAnd as at one time Stas and the lion, so now these two stood opposite\r\neach other--he, an enormity, resembling a house or a rock, and she a\r\nmite whom he could crush with one motion, not indeed in rage but\r\nthrough inadvertence.\r\n\r\nBut the good and prudent animal did not make angry or inadvertent\r\nmotions, but evidently was pleased and happy at the arrival of the\r\nlittle guest.\r\n\r\nNell gained courage gradually and finally raised her eyes upwards and,\r\nlooking as though onto a high roof she asked timidly, raising her\r\nlittle hand:\r\n\r\n\"May I stroke your trunk?\"\r\n\r\nThe elephant did not, indeed, understand English, but from the motion\r\nof her hand discerned at once what she wanted and shoved under her palm\r\nthe end of his trunk, which was over two yards in length.\r\n\r\nNell began to stroke the trunk; at first carefully with one hand,\r\nafterwards with both, and finally embraced it with both arms and hugged\r\nit with perfectly childish trust.\r\n\r\nThe elephant stepped from one foot to the other and continually gurgled\r\nfrom joy.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he wound the diminutive body of the girl with his trunk\r\nand, lifting her up, began to swing her lightly right and left.\r\n\r\n\"More! More!\" cried Nell, intensely amused.\r\n\r\nAnd the play lasted quite a long time and afterwards the little girl,\r\nnow entirely bold, invented a new one.\r\n\r\nFinding herself on the ground, she tried to climb on the elephant's\r\nfore legs, as on a tree, or, hiding behind them, she asked whether he\r\ncould find her. But at these frolics she observed one thing, namely,\r\nthat numerous thorns were stuck in his hind legs; from these the\r\npowerful beast could not free himself, first because he could not\r\nconveniently reach his hind legs with his trunk, and again because he\r\nevidently feared to wound the finger with which the trunk ended and\r\nwithout which he would lose his skill and cleverness. Nell was not at\r\nall aware that such thorns in the feet are a real plague to elephants\r\nin India and still more in the African jungles composed mainly of\r\nthorny plants. As, however, she felt sorry for the honest giant,\r\nwithout any thought, having squatted near his foot, she began to\r\nextract delicately at first the bigger splinters and afterwards the\r\nsmaller, at which work she did not cease to babble and assure the\r\nelephant that she would not leave a single one. He understood\r\nexcellently what she was concerned with, and bending his legs at the\r\nknee showed in this manner that on the soles between the hoofs covering\r\nhis toes there were also thorns which caused him still greater pain.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Stas came from the hunt and at once asked Mea where the\r\nlittle lady was. Receiving a reply that she undoubtedly was in the\r\ntree, he was about to enter the interior of the baobab tree when at\r\nthat moment it seemed to him that he heard Nell's voice in the depth of\r\nthe ravine. Not believing his own ears, he rushed at once to the edge\r\nand, glancing down, was astounded. The little girl sat near the foot of\r\nthe colossus which stood so quietly that if he did not move the trunk\r\nand ears, one would think that he was hewed out of stone.\r\n\r\n\"Nell!\" Stas shouted.\r\n\r\nAnd she, engaged with her work, answered merrily:\r\n\r\n\"At once! At once!\"\r\n\r\nTo this the boy, who was not accustomed to hesitate in the presence of\r\ndanger, lifted his rifle with one hand in the air and with the other\r\ngrabbed a dry liana stalk, which was stripped of its bark, and, winding\r\nhis legs about it, slid to the bottom of the ravine.\r\n\r\nThe elephant moved his ears uneasily, but at that moment Nell rose and,\r\nhugging his trunk, cried hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid, elephant! That is Stas.\"\r\n\r\nStas perceived at once that she was in no danger, but his legs yet\r\ntrembled under him, his heart palpitated violently, and before he\r\nrecovered from the sensation, he began to speak in a choking voice,\r\nfull of grief and anger:\r\n\r\n\"Nell! Nell! How could you do this?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she began to explain that she did not do anything wrong, for the\r\nelephant was good and was already entirely tamed; that she wanted to\r\ntake only one look at him and return, but he stopped her and began to\r\nplay with her, that he swung her very carefully, and if Stas wanted he\r\nwould swing him also.\r\n\r\nSaying this, she took hold of the end of the trunk with one hand and\r\ndrew it to Stas, while she waved the other hand right and left, saying\r\nat the same time to the elephant:\r\n\r\n\"Elephant! Swing Stas also.\"\r\n\r\nThe wise animal surmised from her gesture what she wanted of him, and\r\nStas, caught by the belt of his trousers, in one moment found himself\r\nin mid-air. In this there was such a strange and amusing contrast\r\nbetween his still angry mien and this rocking above the earth that the\r\nlittle \"Mzimu\" began to laugh until the tears came, clapping all the\r\ntime her hands and shouting as before:\r\n\r\n\"More! More!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as it is impossible to preserve an appropriate dignity and deliver\r\na lecture on deportment at a time when one is suspended from the end of\r\nan elephant's trunk and involuntarily goes through the motions of a\r\npendulum, the boy in the end began to laugh also. But after a certain\r\ntime, noticing that the motions of the trunk were slackening and the\r\nelephant intended to deposit him on the ground, a new idea unexpectedly\r\noccurred to him, and, taking advantage of the moment at which he found\r\nhimself close to the prodigious ear, he grabbed it with both hands and\r\nin the twinkling of an eye climbed over it onto the head and sat on the\r\nelephant's neck.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" he exclaimed from above to Nell; \"let him understand that he\r\nmust obey me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to stroke the elephant's head with his palm with the mien\r\nof a ruler and master.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried Nell from below, \"but how will you get down now?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is small trouble,\" Stas answered.\r\n\r\nAnd slinging his legs over the elephant's forehead, he entwined the\r\ntrunk with them and slid over it as if down a tree.\r\n\r\n\"That is how I come down.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which both began to pick out the rest of the thorns from the legs\r\nof the elephant who submitted with the greatest patience.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the first drops of rain fell; so Stas decided to escort\r\nNell to \"Cracow\"; but here an unexpected obstacle presented itself. The\r\nelephant did not want to part from her and every time she attempted to\r\ngo away he turned her about with his trunk and drew her towards him.\r\nThe situation became disagreeable, and the merry play in view of the\r\nstubbornness of the elephant might have ended unfortunately. The boy\r\ndid not know what to do as the rain became each moment heavier and a\r\ndownpour threatened them. Both withdrew, indeed, somewhat towards the\r\negress, but gradually, and the elephant followed them.\r\n\r\nFinally Stas stood between him and Nell. He fixed his gaze upon the\r\nelephant's eyes and at the same time said to Nell in an undertone:\r\n\r\n\"Don't run, but continually draw back to the narrow passageway.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Stas?\" the little maid asked.\r\n\r\n\"Draw back!\" repeated Stas with emphasis, \"otherwise I shall have to\r\nshoot the elephant.\"\r\n\r\nThe little maid, under the influence of this threat, obeyed the\r\ncommand; the more so as, having already unbounded confidence in the\r\nelephant, she was sure that under no circumstances would he do any harm\r\nto Stas.\r\n\r\nBut the boy stood about four paces from the giant, not removing his\r\neyes from him for a moment.\r\n\r\nIn this manner a few minutes passed; a moment full of danger followed.\r\nThe ears of the elephant moved a score of times, his little eyes\r\nglittered strangely, and suddenly his trunk was raised.\r\n\r\nStas felt that he was turning pale.\r\n\r\n\"Death!\" he thought.\r\n\r\nBut the colossus turned his trunk unexpectedly toward the brink where\r\nhe was accustomed to see Nell and began to trumpet more mournfully than\r\nhe had ever done before.\r\n\r\nStas went peacefully to the passageway and behind the rock found Nell,\r\nwho did not want to return to the tree without him.\r\n\r\nThe boy had an uncontrollable desire to say to her: \"See what you have\r\ndone! On account of you I might have been killed.\" But there was no\r\ntime for reproof as the rain changed into a downpour and it was\r\nnecessary to return as quickly as possible. Nell was drenched to the\r\nskin though Stas wrapped her in his clothing.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the tree he ordered the negress to change Nell's\r\ndress while he himself unleashed Saba, whom previously he had tied from\r\nfear that in following his tracks he might scare away the game;\r\nafterwards he began to ransack all the clothing and luggage in the hope\r\nthat he might find some overlooked pinch of quinine.\r\n\r\nBut he did not find anything. Only at the bottom of the small gallipot\r\nwhich the missionary had given him in Khartûm there lay a little white\r\npowder which would scarcely suffice for whitening the tip of a finger.\r\nHe nevertheless determined to fill the gallipot with hot water and give\r\nthis gargle to Nell to drink.\r\n\r\nThen when the downpour had passed away and the sun began to shine\r\nagain, he left the tree to look at the fish which Kali had brought. The\r\nnegro had caught about twenty upon a line of thin wire. Most of them\r\nwere small, but there were three about a foot long, silver speckled and\r\nsurprisingly light. Mea, who was bred upon the banks of the Blue Nile,\r\nwas conversant with these fishes; she said that they were good to eat\r\nand towards evening they leap very high above the water. In fact, at\r\nthe scaling and cleaning of the first it appeared that they were so\r\nlight because they had big air bladders. Stas took one of them about\r\nthe size of an apple and brought it to show to Nell.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he said. \"This was in the fish. We could make a pane for our\r\nwindow from about a dozen of these.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed at the upper opening in the tree.\r\n\r\nBut reflecting for a time he added:\r\n\r\n\"And even something more.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Nell.\r\n\r\n\"A kite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such as you used to send up in Port Said? Oh good! Do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will. With thin, cut pieces of bamboo I will make a frame and I will\r\nuse these membranes instead of paper for they are lighter and the rain\r\nwill not soak them. Such a kite will go away up in the air and with a\r\npowerful wind will fly the Lord knows where--\"\r\n\r\nHere he suddenly struck his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see. As soon as I figure it out better, I will tell you. Now\r\nthat elephant of yours is making such a racket that one cannot even\r\ntalk.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the elephant, from longing for Nell, and perhaps for both\r\nchildren, trumpeted so that the whole ravine shook, together with the\r\nadjacent trees.\r\n\r\n\"We must show ourselves to him,\" Nell said. \"That will quiet him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they strolled to the ravine. But Stas, entirely absorbed in his\r\nthoughts, began in an undertone to say:\r\n\r\n\"'Nelly Rawlinson and Stanislas Tarkowski of Port Said, having escaped\r\nfrom the dervishes in Fashoda, are at--'\"\r\n\r\nAnd stopping abruptly, he asked:\r\n\r\n\"How to designate the place?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Stas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, nothing. I already know,--'are about a month's journey west\r\nof the Blue Nile and beg for immediate aid.' When the wind blows to the\r\nnorth or to the west I will send twenty, fifty, a hundred of such kites\r\nand you, Nell, shall help me to paste them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kites?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I tell you that they can be of greater service to us than ten\r\nelephants.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime they reached the brink. And now began the shuffling of\r\nthe elephant's feet, the nodding, the movements of the ears, the\r\ngurgling, and again the mournful trumpeting when Nell attempted to\r\nretire even for a moment. In the end the little maid began to explain\r\nto the \"dear elephant\" that she could not be with him all the time,\r\nfor, of course, she had to sleep, eat, work, and keep house in\r\n\"Cracow.\" But he became quiet only when she shoved down to him with a\r\npitchfork provisions prepared by Kali; at night he again began to\r\ntrumpet.\r\n\r\nThe children that same evening named him \"The King,\" as Nell was sure\r\nthat before he got caught in the ravine he undoubtedly was the king of\r\nall the elephants in Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the few days following Nell passed all the moments during which\r\nthe rain did not fall with the King, who did not oppose her departure,\r\nhaving understood that the little maiden would return a few times\r\ndaily. Kali, who as a rule feared elephants, gazed at this one with\r\namazement but in the end came to the conclusion that the mighty, \"Good\r\nMzimu\" had bewitched the giant, so he began to visit him also.\r\n\r\nThe King was well disposed in his behavior towards Kali as well as\r\ntowards Mea, but Nell alone could do with him whatever she pleased, so\r\nthat after a week she ventured even to bring Saba to him. For Stas this\r\nwas a great relief as he could with perfect peace leave Nell under the\r\nprotection, or, as he expressed it, \"under the trunk of the elephant,\"\r\nand without any fear he went hunting and even at times took Kali with\r\nhim. He was certain now that the noble animal would not desert them\r\nunder any circumstances and began to consider how to free him from his\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nAnd to speak properly, he long ago had discovered a way, but it\r\nrequired such sacrifices that he wrestled with his thoughts as to\r\nwhether he would use it and afterwards postponed doing it from day to\r\nday. As he had no one to speak to about this, he finally decided to\r\nacquaint Nell with his intentions, though he regarded her as a mere\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\"The rock can be blasted with powder, but for that it is necessary to\r\nspoil a great number of cartridges; that is, to extract the bullets,\r\npour out the powder, and make one big charge out of it all. Such a\r\ncharge I will insert in the deepest fissure which I can find in the\r\nmiddle; afterwards I will plug it and light a fire. Then the rock will\r\nburst into a few or even a score of pieces and we can lead the King\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if there is a great explosion, will he not get scared?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him get scared,\" answered Stas quickly. \"That bothers me the\r\nleast. Really, it is not worth while to talk to you seriously.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless he continued, or rather thought aloud:\r\n\r\n\"But if I do not use enough cartridges the rock will not burst and I\r\nshall waste them in vain; if I use a sufficient number, then not many\r\nwill remain. And if I should be in want of them before the end of the\r\njourney, death clearly threatens us. For with what will I hunt, with\r\nwhat will I defend you in case of an attack? You well know, of course,\r\nthat if it were not for this rifle and the cartridges we would have\r\nperished long ago, either at Gebhr's hands or from starvation. And it\r\nis very fortunate too that we have horses for without them we could not\r\nhave carried all these things and the cartridges.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Nell raised her finger and declared with great positiveness:\r\n\r\n\"When I tell the King, he will carry everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"How will he carry the cartridges, if very few of them remain?\"\r\n\r\n\"As to that, he will defend us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he won't fire from his trunk as I do from the rifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we can eat figs and big gourds which grow on the trees, and Kali\r\nwill catch fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, as long as we stay near the river. We still have to pass the\r\nrainy season here, as these continual downpours would surely prostrate\r\nyou with the fever. Remember, however, that later we shall start upon a\r\nfurther journey and we might chance upon a desert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such as Sahara?\" Nell asked in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"No; one where there are neither rivers, nor fruit-trees, and only low\r\nacacias and mimosas grow. There one can live only upon what is secured\r\nby hunting. The King will find grass there and I antelopes, but if I do\r\nnot have anything to shoot them with, then the King will not catch\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Stas, in reality, had something to worry about, as by that time,\r\nwhen the elephant was already tamed and had become friendly it was\r\nimpossible to abandon him and doom him to death by starvation; and to\r\nliberate him meant the loss of a greater portion of the ammunition and\r\nexposing themselves to unavoidable destruction.\r\n\r\nSo Stas postponed the work from day to day, repeating to himself in his\r\nsoul each evening:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps to-morrow I may devise some other scheme\".\r\n\r\nIn the meantime to this trouble others were added. At first Kali was\r\nstung at the river below by wild bees to which he was led by a small\r\ngray-greenish bird, well-known in Africa and called bee-guide. The\r\nblack boy, through indolence, did not smoke out the bees sufficiently\r\nand returned with honey, but so badly stung and swollen that an hour\r\nlater he lost all consciousness. The \"Good Mzimu,\" with Mea's aid,\r\nextracted stings from him until night and afterwards plastered him with\r\nearth upon which Stas poured water. Nevertheless, towards morning it\r\nseemed as if the poor negro were dying. Fortunately, the nursing and\r\nhis strong constitution overcame the danger; he did not, however,\r\nrecover his health until the lapse of ten days.\r\n\r\nThe second mishap was met by the horses. Stas, who during Kali's\r\nsickness had to fetter the horses and lead them to water, observed that\r\nthey began to grow terribly lean. This could not be explained by a lack\r\nof fodder as in consequence of the rains grass shot up high and there\r\nwas excellent pasturage near the ford. And yet the horses wasted away.\r\nAfter a few days their hair bristled, their eyes became languid, and\r\nfrom their nostrils a thick slime flowed. In the end they ceased to eat\r\nand instead drank eagerly, as if fever consumed them. When Kali\r\nregained his health they were merely two skeletons. But he only glanced\r\nat them and understood at once what had happened.\r\n\r\n\"Tsetse!\" he said, addressing Stas. \"They must die.\"\r\n\r\nStas also understood, for while in Port Said he had often heard of the\r\nAfrican fly, called \"tsetse,\" which is such a terrible plague in some\r\nregions that wherever it has its permanent habitat the negroes do not\r\npossess any cattle at all, and wherever, as a result of temporary\r\nfavorable conditions it multiplies unexpectedly, cattle perish. A\r\nhorse, ox, or donkey bitten by a tsetse wastes and dies in the course\r\nof a fortnight or even in a few days. The local animals understand the\r\ndanger which threatens them, for it happens that whole herds of oxen,\r\nwhen they hear its hum near a waterfall, are thrown into a wild\r\nstampede and scamper in all directions.\r\n\r\nStas' horses were bitten; these horses and the donkey Kali now rubbed\r\ndaily with some kind of plant, the odor of which resembled that of\r\nonions and which he found in the jungles. He said that the odor would\r\ndrive away the tsetse, but notwithstanding this preventative remedy the\r\nhorses grew thinner. Stas, with dread, thought of what might happen if\r\nall the animals should succumb; how then could he convey Nell, the\r\nsaddle-cloth, the tent, the cartridges and the utensils? There was so\r\nmuch of them that only the King could carry them all. But to liberate\r\nthe King it was necessary to sacrifice at least two-thirds of the\r\ncartridges.\r\n\r\nEver-increasing troubles gathered over Stas' head like the clouds which\r\ndid not cease to water the jungle with rain. Finally came the greatest\r\ncalamity, in the presence of which all the others dwindled--fever!\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nOne night at supper Nell, having raised a piece of smoked meat to her\r\nlips, suddenly pushed it away, as if with loathing, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot eat to-day.\"\r\n\r\nStas, who had learned from Kali where the bees were and had smoked them\r\nout daily in order to get their honey, was certain that the little one\r\nhad eaten during the day too much honey, and for that reason he did not\r\npay any attention to her lack of appetite. But she after a while rose\r\nand began to walk hurriedly about the camp-fire describing an ever\r\nlarger circle.\r\n\r\n\"Do not get away too far, for something might seize you,\" the boy\r\nshouted at her.\r\n\r\nHe really, however, did not fear anything, for the elephant's presence,\r\nwhich the wild animals scented, and his trumpeting, which reached their\r\nvigilant ears, held them at a respectable distance. It assured safety\r\nalike to the people and to the horses, for the most ferocious beasts of\r\nprey in the jungle, the lion, the panther, and the leopard, prefer to\r\nhave nothing to do with an elephant and not to approach too near his\r\ntusks and trunk.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the little maid continued to run around, more and\r\nmore hurriedly, Stas followed her and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Say, little moth! Why are you flying like that about the fire?\"\r\n\r\nHe asked still jestingly, but really was uneasy and his uneasiness\r\nincreased when Nell answered:\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I can't sit down in any place.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel so strangely--\"\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly she rested her head on his bosom and as though\r\nconfessing a fault, exclaimed in a meek voice, broken by sobs:\r\n\r\n\"Stas, perhaps I am sick--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nell!\"\r\n\r\nThen he placed his palm upon her forehead which was dry and icy. So he\r\ntook her in his arms and carried her to the camp-fire.\r\n\r\n\"Are you cold?\" he asked on the way.\r\n\r\n\"Cold and hot, but more cold--\"\r\n\r\nIn fact her little teeth chattered and chills continually shook her\r\nbody. Stas now did not have the slightest doubt that she had a fever.\r\n\r\nHe at once ordered Mea to conduct her to the tree, undress her and\r\nplace her on the ground, and afterwards to cover her with whatever she\r\ncould find, for he had seen in Khartûm and Fashoda that fever-stricken\r\npeople were covered with sheeps' hide in order to perspire freely. He\r\ndetermined to sit at Nell's side the whole night and give her hot water\r\nwith honey to drink. But she in the beginning did not want to drink. By\r\nthe light of the little lamp hung in the interior of the tree he\r\nobserved her glittering eyes. After a while she began to complain of\r\nthe heat and at the same time shook under the saddle-cloth and plaids.\r\nHer hands and forehead continued cold, but had Stas known anything\r\nabout febrile disorders, he would have seen by her extraordinary\r\nrestlessness that she must have a terrible fever. With fear he observed\r\nthat when Mea entered with hot water the little girl gazed at her as\r\nthough with a certain amazement and even fear and did not seem to\r\nrecognize her. With him she spoke consciously. She said to him that she\r\ncould not lie down and begged him to permit her to rise and run about;\r\nthen again she asked whether he was not angry at her because she was\r\nsick, and when he assured her that he was not, her eyelashes were\r\nsuffused with the tears which surged to her eyes, and she assured him\r\nthat on the morrow she would be entirely well.\r\n\r\nThat evening, or that night, the elephant was somehow strangely\r\ndisturbed and continually trumpeted so as to awake Saba and cause him\r\nto bark. Stas observed that this irritated the patient; so he left the\r\ntree to quiet them. He silenced Saba easily, but as it was a harder\r\nmatter to bid the elephant to be silent, he took with him a few melons\r\nto throw to him, and stuff his trunk at least for a time. Returning, he\r\nobserved, by the light of the camp-fire, Kali who, with a piece of\r\nsmoked meat on his shoulders, was going in the direction of the river.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing there, and where are you going?\" he asked the negro.\r\n\r\nAnd the black boy stopped, and when Stas drew near to him said with a\r\nmysterious countenance:\r\n\r\n\"Kali is going to another tree to place meat for the wicked Mzimu.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"That the wicked Mzimu should not kill the 'Good Mzimu.'\"\r\n\r\nStas wanted to say something in reply, but suddenly grief seized his\r\nbosom; so he only set his teeth and walked away in silence.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the tree Nell's eyes were closed, her hands, lying\r\non the saddle-cloth, quivered indeed strongly, but it seemed that she\r\nwas slumbering. Stas sat down near her, and from fear of waking her he\r\nsat motionless. Mea, sitting on the other side, readjusted every little\r\nwhile pieces of ivory protruding out of her ears, in order to defend\r\nherself in this manner from drowsiness. It became still; only from the\r\nriver below, from the direction of the overflow, came the croaking of\r\nfrogs and the melancholy piping of toads.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Nell sat up on the bedding.\r\n\r\n\"Stas!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am here, Nell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she, shaking like a leaf in the breeze, began to seek his hands and\r\nrepeat hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid! I am afraid! Give me your hand!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't fear. I am with you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he grasped her palm which this time was heated as if on fire; not\r\nknowing what to do he began to cover that poor, emaciated hand with\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid, Nell! don't be afraid!\"\r\n\r\nAfter which he gave her water with honey to drink, which by that time\r\nhad cooled. This time Nell drank eagerly and clung to the hand with the\r\nutensil when he tried to take it away from her lips. The cool drink\r\nseemed to soothe her.\r\n\r\nSilence ensued. But after the lapse of half an hour Nell again sat up\r\non the bedding and in her wide-open eyes could be seen terrible fright.\r\n\r\n\"Stas!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" she asked in a broken voice, \"do Gebhr and Chamis walk around\r\nthe tree and peer at me?\"\r\n\r\nTo Stas in an instant it seemed as if thousands of ants were crawling\r\nover him.\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying, Nell?\" he said. \"There is nobody here. That is\r\nKali walking around the tree.\"\r\n\r\nBut she, staring at the dark opening, cried with chattering teeth:\r\n\r\n\"And the Bedouins too! Why did you kill them?\"\r\n\r\nStas clasped her with his arms and pressed her to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"You know why! Don't look there! Don't think of that! That happened\r\nlong ago!\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day! to-day!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Nell, long ago.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact it was long ago, but it had returned like a wave beaten back\r\nfrom the shore and again filled with terror the thoughts of the sick\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nAll words of reassurance appeared in vain. Nell's eyes widened more and\r\nmore. Her heart palpitated so violently that it seemed that it would\r\nburst at any moment. She began to throw herself about like a fish taken\r\nout of the water, and this continued almost until morning. Only towards\r\nthe morning was her strength exhausted and her head dropped upon the\r\nbedding.\r\n\r\n\"I am weak, weak,\" she repeated. \"Stas, I am flying somewhere down\r\nbelow.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which she closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nStas at first became terribly alarmed for he thought that she had died.\r\nBut this was only the end of the first paroxysm of the dreadful African\r\nfever, termed deadly, two attacks of which strong and healthy people\r\ncan resist, but the third no one thus far had been able to withstand.\r\nTravelers had often related this in Port Said in Mr. Rawlinson's home,\r\nand yet more frequently Catholic missionaries returning to Europe, whom\r\nPan Tarkowski received hospitably. The second attack comes after a few\r\ndays or a fortnight, while if the third does not come within two weeks\r\nit is not fatal as it is reckoned as the first in the recurrence of the\r\nsickness. Stas knew that the only medicine which could break or keep\r\noff the attack was quinine in big doses, but now he did not have an\r\natom of it.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, however, seeing that Nell was breathing, he became\r\nsomewhat calm and began to pray for her. But in the meantime the sun\r\nleaped from beyond the rocks of the ravine and it was day. The elephant\r\nalready demanded his breakfast and from the direction of the overflow\r\nwhich the river made resounded the cries of aquatic birds. Desiring to\r\nkill a brace of guinea-fowl for broth for Nell, the boy took his gun\r\nand strolled along the river towards a clump of shrubs on which these\r\nbirds usually perched for the night. But he felt the effect of lack of\r\nsleep so much and his thoughts were so occupied with the little girl's\r\nillness that a whole flock of guinea-fowl passed close by him in a\r\ntrot, one after another, bound for the watering place, and he did not\r\nobserve them at all. This happened also because he was continually\r\npraying. He thought of the slaying of Gebhr, Chamis, and the Bedouins,\r\nand lifting his eyes upwards he said with a voice choking with tears:\r\n\r\n\"I did this for Nell, oh Lord, for Nell! For I could not free her\r\notherwise; but if it is a sin, punish me, but let her regain her\r\nhealth.\"\r\n\r\nOn the way he met Kali, who had gone to see whether the wicked Mzimu\r\nate the meat offered to him the previous night. The young negro, loving\r\nthe little \"bibi,\" prayed also for her, but he prayed in an entirely\r\ndifferent fashion. He particularly told the wicked Mzimu that if the\r\n\"bibi\" recovered her health he would bring him a piece of meat every\r\nday, but if she died, though he feared him and though he might\r\nafterwards perish, he would first so flay his hide that the wicked\r\nMzimu would remember it for ages. He felt greatly encouraged when the\r\nmeat deposited the previous night disappeared. It might indeed have\r\nbeen carried away by some jackal, but the Mzimu might assume the shape\r\nof a jackal.\r\n\r\nKali informed Stas of this propitious incident; the latter, however,\r\nstared at him as if he did not understand him at all and went on\r\nfurther. Passing a clump of shrubs in which he did not find any\r\nguinea-fowl, he drew nearer the river. Its banks were overgrown with\r\ntall trees from which were suspended like long stockings the nests of\r\ntitmice, beautiful little yellow birds with black wings, and also\r\nwasps' nests resembling big roses, but colored like gray\r\nblotting-paper. In one place the river formed an expansion a few score\r\npaces wide, overgrown in part by papyrus. On this expansion aquatic\r\nbirds always swarmed. There were storks just like our European storks,\r\nand storks with thick bills ending with a hook, and birds black as\r\nvelvet, with legs red as blood, and flamingoes and ibises, and white\r\nspoon-bills with bills like spoons, and cranes with crowns on their\r\nheads, and a multitude of curlews, variegated and gray as mice, flying\r\nquickly back and forth as if they were tiny sylvan sprites on long,\r\nthin, snipe-like legs.\r\n\r\nStas killed two large ducks, beautiful, cinnamon colored, and treading\r\nupon dead butterflies, of which thousands strewed the bank, he first\r\nlooked around carefully to see whether there were any crocodiles in the\r\nshallows, after which he waded into the water and lifted his quarry.\r\nThe shots had dispersed the birds; there remained only two marabous,\r\nstanding between ten and twenty paces away and plunged in reverie. They\r\nwere like two old men with bald heads pressed between the shoulders.\r\nThey did not move at all. The boy gazed for a while at the loathsome\r\nfleshy pouches hanging from their breasts, and afterwards, observing\r\nthat the wasps were beginning to circle around him more and more\r\nfrequently, he returned to the camping place.\r\n\r\nNell still slept; so handing the ducks to Mea, he flung himself upon a\r\nsaddle-cloth and fell into a sound sleep. They did not wake until the\r\nafternoon--he first and Nell later. The little girl felt somewhat\r\nstronger and the strong broth revived her strength still more; she rose\r\nand left the tree, desiring to look at the King and at the sun.\r\n\r\nBut only now in the daylight could be seen what havoc that one night's\r\nfever had wrought in her. Her complexion was yellow and transparent;\r\nher lips were black; there were circles furrowed under her eyes, and\r\nher face was as though it had aged. Even the pupils of her eyes\r\nappeared paler than usual. It appeared also, despite her assurances to\r\nStas that she felt quite strong and notwithstanding the large cup of\r\nbroth which she drank immediately after awakening, that she could\r\nbarely reach the ravine unaided. Stas thought with despair of the\r\nsecond attack and that he had neither medicine nor any remedy by which\r\nhe could prevent it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the rain poured a dozen or more times a day, increasing\r\nthe humidity of the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nDays of suspense, heavy and full of fear, began. The second attack did\r\nnot come until a week after and was not so strong as the first, but\r\nafter it Nell felt still weaker. She wasted and grew so thin that she\r\nno longer was a little girl, but the shadow of a little girl. The flame\r\nof her life flickered so faintly that it appeared sufficient to blow at\r\nit to extinguish it. Stas understood that death did not have to wait\r\nfor a third attack to take her and he expected it any day or any hour.\r\n\r\nHe himself became emaciated and black, for misfortune exceeded his\r\nstrength and his reason. So, gazing on her waxen countenance, he said\r\nto himself each day: \"For this I guarded her like the eye in the head;\r\nin order to bury her here in the jungle.\" And he did not understand why\r\nit should be so. At times he reproached himself that he had not guarded\r\nher enough, that he had not been sufficiently kind to her, and at such\r\nmoments such sorrow seized his heart that he wanted to gnaw his own\r\nfingers. Clearly there was too much of woe.\r\n\r\nAnd Nell now slept almost continuously and it may be that this kept her\r\nalive. Stas woke her a few times a day to give her nourishment. Then,\r\nas often as it did not rain, she begged him to carry her into the open\r\nair for now she could not stand on her own feet. It happened, moreover,\r\nthat she fell asleep in his arms. She knew now that she was very sick\r\nand might at any moment die. In moments of greater animation she spoke\r\nof this to Stas, and always with tears, for she feared death.\r\n\r\nOnce she said: \"I shall not now return to papa, but tell him that I was\r\nvery, very sorry--and beg him to come to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will return,\" Stas answered.\r\n\r\nAnd he could not say anything more as he wanted to wail.\r\n\r\nAnd Nell continued in a scarcely audible, dreamy voice:\r\n\r\n\"And papa will come and you will come sometime, will you not?\"\r\n\r\nAt this thought a smile brightened the little wan face, but after a\r\nwhile she said in a still lower tone:\r\n\r\n\"But I am so sorry!\"\r\n\r\nSaying this she rested her little head upon his shoulder and began to\r\nweep. He mastered his pain, pressed her to his bosom, and replied with\r\nanimation:\r\n\r\n\"Nell, I will not return without you--and I do not at all know what I\r\nwould do in this world without you.\"\r\n\r\nSilence followed, during which Nell again fell asleep.\r\n\r\nStas carried her to the tree, but he had barely gone outside when from\r\nthe summit of the promontory Kali came running and waving his hands; he\r\nbegan to shout, with an agitated and frightened face:\r\n\r\n\"Great master! Great master!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\nAnd the negro, stretching out his hand and pointing to the south, said:\r\n\r\n\"Smoke!\"\r\n\r\nStas shaded his eyes with his palm and straining his sight in the\r\ndirection indicated really saw in the ruddy luster of the sun, which\r\nnow stood low, a streak of smoke rising far in the jungle, amid the top\r\nof two still more distant hills which were quite high.\r\n\r\nKali trembled all over, for he well remembered his horrible slavery\r\nwith the dervishes; he was certain that this was their camping place.\r\nTo Stas, also, it seemed that this could not be any one else than\r\nSmain, and at first he too became terribly frightened. Only this was\r\nwanting! Besides Nell's fatal disease, the dervishes! And again\r\nslavery, and again a return to Fashoda or to Khartûm, under the hand of\r\nthe Mahdi or the lash of Abdullahi. If they caught them Nell would die\r\nat once, while he would remain a slave the rest of the days of his\r\nlife; and if he did escape of what use was liberty to him without Nell?\r\nHow could he look into the eyes of his father or Mr. Rawlinson, if the\r\ndervishes after her death should fling her to the hyenas. He himself\r\nwould not even be able to say where her grave was.\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts flitted through his head like lightning. Suddenly he felt\r\nan insurmountable desire to look at Nell, and directed his steps\r\ntowards the tree. On the way he instructed Kali to extinguish the fire\r\nand not to dare to light it during the night, after which he entered\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nNell was not sleeping and felt better. She at once communicated this\r\nnews to Stas. Saba lay close to her and warmed her with his huge body,\r\nwhile she stroked his head lightly, smiling when he caught with his\r\njaws the subtile dust of the decayed wood floating in the streak of\r\nlight which the last rays of the setting sun formed in the tree. She\r\napparently was in a better frame of mind, as after a while she\r\naddressed Stas with quite a lively mien.\r\n\r\n\"And perhaps I may not die.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely will not die,\" Stas replied; \"since after the second attack\r\nyou feel stronger, the third will not come at all.\"\r\n\r\nBut she began to blink with her eyelids as if she were meditating over\r\nsomething and said:\r\n\r\n\"If I had bitter powders like that which made me feel so well after the\r\nnight with the lions--do you remember?--then I would not think the\r\nleast bit of dying not even so much!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she indicated upon her little finger just how little in that case\r\nshe would be prepared to die.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" Stas declared, \"I do not know what I would not give for a pinch\r\nof quinine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he thought that if he had enough of it, he would at once treat Nell\r\nwith two powders, even, and then he would wrap her in plaids, seat her\r\nbefore him on a horse, and start immediately in a direction opposite to\r\nthe one in which the camp of the dervishes was located.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the sun set and the jungle was suddenly plunged in\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe little girl chattered yet for half an hour, after which she fell\r\nasleep and Stas meditated further about the dervishes and quinine. His\r\ndistressed but resourceful mind began to labor and form plans, each one\r\nbolder and more audacious than the other. First he began to ponder over\r\nwhether that smoke in the southern direction necessarily came from\r\nSmain's camp. It might indeed be dervishes, but it also might be Arabs\r\nfrom the ocean coast, who made great expeditions into the interior for\r\nivory and slaves. These had nothing in common with the dervishes who\r\ninjured their trade. The smoke might also be from a camp of Abyssinians\r\nor from some negro village at the foot-hills which the slave hunters\r\nhad not yet reached. Would it not be proper for him to satisfy himself\r\nupon this point?\r\n\r\nThe Arabs from Zanzibar, from the vicinity of Bagamoyo, from Witu and\r\nfrom Mombasa, and in general from the territory bordering on the ocean,\r\nwere people who continuously came in contact with white men; so who\r\nknows whether for a great reward they would not conduct them to the\r\nnearest port? Stas knew perfectly well that he could promise such a\r\nreward and that they would believe his promise. There occurred to him\r\nanother idea which touched him to the depth. In Khartûm he saw that\r\nmany of the dervishes, particularly those from Nubia, suffered fever\r\nalmost as badly as the white people and that they cured themselves with\r\nquinine which they stole from the Europeans, and if it were hidden by\r\nrenegade Greeks or Copts they purchased it for its weight in gold. So\r\nit might be expected that the Arabs from the coast would be certain to\r\nhave it.\r\n\r\n\"I shall go,\" Stas said to himself, \"I shall go, for Nell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd pondering more and more strongly upon the situation he, in the end,\r\ncame to the conclusion that even if that was Smain's division, it was\r\nincumbent for him to go. He recollected that on account of the complete\r\nrupture of relations between Egypt and the Sudân, Smain in all\r\nprobability knew nothing about their abduction from Fayûm.\r\n\r\nFatma could not have had an understanding with him; therefore that\r\nabduction was her individual scheme, executed with the aid of Chamis,\r\nson of Chadigi, together with Idris, Gebhr, and the two Bedouins. Now\r\nthese men did not concern Smain for the simple reason that among them\r\nhe knew only Chamis, and the others he never saw in his life. He was\r\nconcerned only about his own children and Fatma. But he might long for\r\nthem now, and might be glad to return to them, particularly if in the\r\nservice of the Mahdi he apparently did not meet with great fortune,\r\nsince instead of commanding powerful troops or governing some vast\r\nregion he was compelled to catch slaves the Lord knew where--far beyond\r\nFashoda. \"I will say to him,\" Stas thought, \"that if you will lead us\r\nto any seaport on the Indian Ocean and return with us to Egypt, the\r\ngovernment will pardon all your offenses; you will rejoin Fatma and the\r\nchildren, and besides, Mr. Rawlinson will make you rich; if not you\r\nwill never again see your children and Fatma in your life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was certain that Smain would consider well before he rejected\r\nsuch an arrangement.\r\n\r\nOf course this was not altogether safe; it might even prove disastrous,\r\nbut it might become a plank of rescue from that African whirlpool. Stas\r\nin the end began to wonder why the possibility of meeting with Smain\r\nshould have frightened him at first and, as he was anxious for quick\r\nrelief for Nell, he determined to go, even that night.\r\n\r\nIt was easier, however, to say than to do it; it is one thing to sit at\r\nnight in the jungle near a good fire behind a thorny zareba, and\r\nanother to set forth amid darkness, in high grass, in which at such a\r\ntime the lion, panther, and leopard, not to speak of hyenas and\r\njackals, are seeking their prey. The boy, however, recollected the\r\nwords of the young negro at the time when he went during the night to\r\nsearch for Saba and, having returned, said to him, \"Kali feared but\r\nKali went.\" And he repeated to himself, \"I shall fear, but I will go.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited, however, until the moon rose, as the night was\r\nextraordinarily dark, and only when the jungle was silvered by her\r\nluster did he call Kali and say:\r\n\r\n\"Kali, take Saba into the tree, close the entrance with thorns, and\r\nguard the little lady with Mea as the eye in your head, while I go and\r\nsee what kind of people are in that camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great master, take Kali with you and the rifle which kills bad\r\nanimals. Kali does not want to stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall stay!\" Stas said firmly. \"And I forbid you to go with me.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which he became silent, but presently said in a somewhat hollow\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"Kali, you are faithful and prudent, so I am confident that you will do\r\nwhat I tell you. If I should not return and the little lady should die,\r\nyou will leave her in the tree, but around the tree you will build a\r\nhigh zareba and on the bark you will carve a great sign like this.\"\r\n\r\nAnd taking two bamboos, he formed them into a cross, after which he\r\ncontinued thus:\r\n\r\n\"If, however, I do not return and the 'bibi' does not die you shall\r\nhonor her and serve her faithfully, and afterwards you shall conduct\r\nher to your people, and tell the Wahima warriors that they should go\r\ncontinually to the east until they reach the great sea. There you will\r\nfind white men who will give you many rifles, much powder, beads, and\r\nwire, and as much cloth as you are able to carry. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the young negro threw himself on his knees, embraced Stas' limbs,\r\nand began to repeat mournfully:\r\n\r\n\"Bwana kubwa! You will return! You will return!\"\r\n\r\nStas was deeply touched by the black boy's devotion, so he leaned over\r\nhim, placed his hand on his head, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Go into the tree, Kali--and may God bless you!\"\r\n\r\nRemaining alone, he deliberated for a while whether to take the donkey\r\nwith him. This was the safer course, for lions in Africa as well as the\r\ntigers in India, in case they meet a man riding a horse or donkey,\r\nalways charge at the animal and not at the man. But he propounded to\r\nhimself the question, who in such case will carry Nell's tent and on\r\nwhat will she herself ride? After this observation he rejected at once\r\nthe idea of taking the donkey and set off on foot in the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe moon already rose higher in the heavens; it was therefore\r\nconsiderably lighter. Nevertheless, the difficulties began as soon as\r\nthe boy plunged into the grass, which grew so high that a man on\r\nhorseback could easily be concealed in it. Even in the daytime one\r\ncould not see a step ahead in it, and what of the night, when the moon\r\nilluminated only the heights, and below everything was steeped in a\r\ndeep shade? Under such conditions it was easy to stray and walk around\r\nin a circle instead of moving forward. Stas, nevertheless, was cheered\r\nby the thought that in the first place the camp, towards which he went,\r\nwas at most three or four English miles distant from the promontory,\r\nand again that it appeared between the tops of two lofty hills;\r\ntherefore, by keeping the hills in sight, one could not stray. But the\r\ngrass, mimosa, and acacias veiled everything. Fortunately every few\r\nscore of paces there stood white-ant hillocks, sometimes between ten\r\nand twenty feet high. Stas carefully placed the rifle at the bottom of\r\neach hillock; afterwards climbed to the top, and descrying the hills\r\nblackly outlined on the background of the sky, descended and proceeded\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nFear seized him only at the thought of what would happen if clouds\r\nshould veil the moon and the sky, for then he would find himself as\r\nthough in a subterranean cavern. But this was not the only danger. The\r\njungle in the night time, when, amidst the stillness can be heard every\r\nsound, every step, and almost the buzz which the insects creeping over\r\nthe grass make, is downright terrifying. Fear and terror hover over it.\r\nStas had to pay heed to everything, to listen, watch, look around in\r\nevery direction, have his head on screws, as it were, and have the\r\nrifle ready to fire at any second. Every moment it seemed to him that\r\nsomething was approaching, skulking, hiding in ambush. From time to\r\ntime he heard the grass stir and the sudden clatter of animals running\r\naway. He then conjectured that he had scared some antelopes which,\r\nnotwithstanding posted guards, sleep watchfully, knowing that many\r\nyellow, terrible hunters are seeking them at that hour in the darkness.\r\nBut now something big is darkly outlined under the umbrella-like\r\nacacia. It may be a rock and it may be a rhinoceros or a buffalo which,\r\nhaving scented a man, will wake from a nap and rush at once to attack\r\nhim. Yonder again behind a black bush can be seen two glittering dots.\r\nHeigh! Rifle to face! That is a lion! No! Vain alarm! Those are\r\nfireflies for one dim light rises upwards and flies above the grass\r\nlike a star shooting obliquely. Stas climbed onto ant-hillocks, not\r\nalways to ascertain whether he was going in the right direction, but to\r\nwipe the cold perspiration from his brow, to recover his breath, and to\r\nwait until his heart, palpitating too rapidly, calmed. In addition he\r\nwas already so fatigued that he was barely able to stand on his feet.\r\n\r\nBut he proceeded because he felt that he must do so, to save Nell.\r\nAfter two hours he got to a place, thickly strewn with stones, where\r\nthe grass was lower and it was considerably lighter. The lofty hills\r\nappeared as distant as before; on the other hand nearer were the rocky\r\nridges running transversely, beyond which the second, higher hill\r\narose, while both evidently enclosed some kind of valley or ravine\r\nsimilar to the one in which the King was confined.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, about three or four hundred paces on the right, he perceived\r\non the rocky wall the rosy reflection of a flame.\r\n\r\nHe stood still. His heart again beat so strongly that he almost heard\r\nit amid the stillness of the night. Whom would he see below? Arabs from\r\nthe eastern coast? Smain's dervishes, or savage negroes who, escaping\r\nfrom their native villages, sought protection from the dervishes in the\r\ninaccessible thickets of the hills? Would he find death, or slavery, or\r\nsalvation for Nell?\r\n\r\nIt was imperative to ascertain this. He could not retreat now, nor did\r\nhe desire to. After a while he stepped in the direction of the fire,\r\nmoving as quietly as possible and holding the breath in his bosom.\r\nHaving proceeded thus about a hundred paces he unexpectedly heard from\r\nthe direction of the jungle the snorting of horses and again stopped.\r\nIn the moonlight he counted five horses. For the dervishes this would\r\nnot be enough, but he assumed that the rest were concealed in the high\r\ngrass. He was only surprised that there were no guards near them nor\r\nhad these guards lighted any fires above to scare away the wild\r\nanimals. But he thanked the Lord that it was so, as he could proceed\r\nfarther without detection.\r\n\r\nThe luster on the rocks became more and more distinct. Before a quarter\r\nof an hour passed, Stas found himself at a place at which the opposite\r\nrock was most illuminated, which indicated that at its base a fire must\r\nbe burning.\r\n\r\nThen, crawling slowly, he crept to the brink and glanced below.\r\n\r\nThe first object which struck his eyes was a big white tent; before the\r\ntent stood a canvas field bed, and on it lay a man attired in a white\r\nEuropean dress. A little negro, perhaps twelve years old, was adding\r\ndry fuel to the fire which illumined the rocky wall and a row of\r\nnegroes sleeping under it on both sides of the tent.\r\n\r\nStas in one moment slid down the declivity to the bottom of the ravine.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time from exhaustion and emotion he could not utter a word,\r\nand stood panting heavily before the man lying on the bed, who also was\r\nsilent and stared at him with an amazement bordering almost upon\r\nunconsciousness.\r\n\r\nFinally the latter exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Nasibu! Are you there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master,\" answered the negro lad.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see any one any one standing there before me?\"\r\n\r\nBut before the boy was able to reply Stas recovered his speech.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"my name is Stanislas Tarkowski. With little Miss\r\nRawlinson I have escaped from dervish captivity and we are hiding in\r\nthe jungle. But Nell is terribly sick; and for her sake I beg for help.\"\r\n\r\nThe unknown continued to stare at him, blinking with his eyes, and then\r\nrubbed his brow with his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I not only see but hear!\" he said to himself. \"This is no illusion!\r\nWhat? Help? I myself am in need of help. I am wounded.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, he shook himself as though out of a wild dream or\r\ntorpor, gazed more consciously, and, with a gleam of joy in his eyes,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"A white boy!--I again see a white one! I welcome you whoever you are.\r\nDid you speak of some sick girl? What do you want of me?\"\r\n\r\nStas repeated that the sick girl was Nell, the daughter of Mr.\r\nRawlinson, one of the directors of the Canal; that she already had\r\nsuffered from two attacks of fever and must die if he did not obtain\r\nquinine to prevent the third.\r\n\r\n\"Two attacks--that is bad!\" answered the unknown. \"But I can give you\r\nas much quinine as you want. I have several jars of it which are of no\r\nuse to me now.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus, he ordered little Nasibu to hand him a big tin box,\r\nwhich apparently was a small traveling drug store; he took out of it\r\ntwo rather large jars filled with a powder and gave them to Stas.\r\n\r\n\"This is half of what I have. It will last you for a year even.\"\r\n\r\nStas had a desire to shout from sheer delight, so he began to thank him\r\nwith as much rapture as if his own life were involved.\r\n\r\nThe unknown nodded his head several times, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Good, good, my name is Linde; I am a Swiss from Zurich. Two days ago I\r\nmet with an accident. A wart-hog wounded me severely.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards he addressed the lad:\r\n\r\n\"Nasibu, fill my pipe.\"\r\n\r\nThen he said to Stas:\r\n\r\n\"In the night-time the fever is worse and my mind becomes confused. But\r\na pipe clears my thoughts. Truly, did you say that you had escaped from\r\ndervish captivity and are hiding in the jungle? Is it so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I said it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you intend to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fly to Abyssinia.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will fall into the hands of the Mahdists; whose divisions are\r\nprowling all along the boundary.\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot, however, undertake anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, a month ago I could still have given you aid. But now I am\r\nalone--dependent only upon Divine mercy and that black lad.\"\r\n\r\nStas gazed at him with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"And this camp?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the camp of death.\"\r\n\r\n\"And those negroes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those negroes are sleeping and will not awaken any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand--\"\r\n\r\n\"They are suffering from the sleeping sickness.* [* Recent\r\ninvestigations have demonstrated that this disease is inoculated in\r\npeople by the bite of the same fly \"tsetse\" which kills oxen and\r\nhorses. Nevertheless its bite causes the sleeping sickness only in\r\ncertain localities. During the time of the Mahdist rebellion the cause\r\nof the disease was unknown.] Those are men from beyond the Great Lakes\r\nwhere this terrible disease is continually raging and all fell prey to\r\nit, excepting those who previously died of small-pox. Only that boy\r\nremains to me.\"\r\n\r\nStas, just before, was struck by the fact that at the time when he slid\r\ninto the ravine not a negro stirred or even quivered, and that during\r\nthe whole conversation all slept--some with heads propped on the rock,\r\nothers with heads drooping upon their breasts.\r\n\r\n\"They are sleeping and will not awaken any more?\" he asked, as though\r\nhe had not yet realized the significance of what he had heard.\r\n\r\nAnd Linde said:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! This Africa is a charnel house.\"\r\n\r\nBut further conversation was interrupted by the stamping of the horses,\r\nwhich, startled at something in the jungle, came jumping with fettered\r\nlegs to the edge of the valley, desiring to be nearer to the men and\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\n\"That is nothing--those are horses,\" the Swiss said. \"I captured them\r\nfrom the Mahdists whom I routed a few weeks ago. There were three\r\nhundred of them; perhaps more. But they had principally spears, and my\r\nmen Remingtons, which now are stacked under that wall, absolutely\r\nuseless. If you need arms or ammunition take all that you want. Take a\r\nhorse also; you will return sooner to your patient--how old is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight,\" Stas replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then she is still a child-- Let Nasibu give you tea, rice, coffee, and\r\nwine for her. Take of the supplies whatever you want, and to-morrow\r\ncome for more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall surely return to thank you once more from my whole heart and\r\nhelp you in whatever I can.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Linde said:\r\n\r\n\"It is good even to gaze at a European face. If you had come earlier I\r\nwould have been more conscious. Now the fever is taking hold of me, for\r\nI see double. Are there two of you above me? No, I know that you are\r\nalone and that this is only the fever. Ah! this Africa!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later Stas started to return from this strange\r\ncamp of sleep and death, but this time on horseback. The night was\r\nstill dark, but now he paid no heed to any dangers which he might\r\nencounter in the high grass. He kept, however, more closely to the\r\nriver, assuming that both ravines must lead to it. After all it was\r\nconsiderably easier to return, as in the stillness of the night came\r\nfrom a distance the roar of the waterfall; the clouds in the western\r\nsky were scattered and, besides the moon, the zodiacal light shone\r\nstrongly. The boy pricked the horse on the flanks with the broad\r\nArabian stirrups and rode at almost breakneck speed, saying in his\r\nsoul: \"What are lions and panthers to me? I have quinine for my little\r\none!\" And from time to time he felt the jars with his hand, as if he\r\nwanted to assure himself that he actually possessed them and that it\r\nwas not all a dream. Various thoughts and pictures flitted through his\r\nbrain. He saw the wounded Swiss to whom he felt immense gratitude and\r\nwhom he pitied so heartily that, at first, during their conversation,\r\nhe took him for a madman; he saw little Nasibu with skull as round as a\r\nball, and the row of sleeping \"pagahs,\" and the barrels of the\r\nRemingtons stacked against the rock and glistening in the fire. He was\r\nalmost certain that the battle which Linde mentioned was with Smain's\r\ndivision, and it seemed strange to him to think that Smain might have\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\nWith these visions mingled the constant thought of Nell. He pictured to\r\nhimself how surprised she would be to behold on the morrow a whole jar\r\nof quinine, and that she probably would take him for a performer of\r\nmiracles. \"Ah,\" he said to himself, \"if I had acted like a coward and\r\nhad not gone to ascertain where that smoke came from I would not have\r\nforgiven myself during the rest of my life.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a little less than an hour the roar of the waterfall\r\nbecame quite distinct and, from the croaking of frogs, he conjectured\r\nthat he already was near the expansion where he had previously shot\r\naquatic birds. In the moon's luster he even recognized in the distance\r\nthe trees standing above it. Now it was necessary to exercise greater\r\ncaution, as that overflow formed at the same time a watering place to\r\nwhich all the animals of the locality came, for the banks of the river\r\nelsewhere were steep and inaccessible. But it was already late and the\r\nbeasts of prey evidently hid in rocky dens after their nocturnal\r\nquests. The horse snorted a little, scenting the recent tracks of lions\r\nor panthers; nevertheless, Stas rode on happily, and a moment later saw\r\non the high promontory the big black silhouette of \"Cracow.\" For the\r\nfirst time in Africa he had a sensation as if he had arrived at home.\r\n\r\nHe reckoned that he would find all asleep, but he reckoned without\r\nSaba, who began to bark loud enough to awaken even the dead. Kali also\r\nappeared before the tree and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Bwana kubwa! On horseback!\"\r\n\r\nIn his voice there was, however, more joy than surprise, as he believed\r\nin Stas' powers so much that if the latter had even created a horse,\r\nthe black boy would not have been very much surprised.\r\n\r\nBut as joy in negroes manifests itself in laughter, he began to slap\r\nhis thighs with his palms and laugh like a madman.\r\n\r\n\"Tie this horse,\" Stas said. \"Remove the supplies from him, build a\r\nfire, and boil water.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this he entered the tree. Nell awoke also and began to call him.\r\nStas, drawing aside the canvas wall, saw by the light of the fire-pot\r\nher pale face, and thin, white hands lying on the plaids with which she\r\nwas covered.\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel, little one?\" he asked merrily.\r\n\r\n\"Good, and I slept well until Saba awoke me. But why do you not sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I rode away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"To a drug store.\"\r\n\r\n\"To a drug store?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for quinine.\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl did not indeed relish very much the taste of the\r\nquinine powders which she had taken before, but, as she regarded them\r\nas an infallible remedy for all the diseases in the world, she sighed\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"I know that you have not got any quinine.\"\r\n\r\nStas raised one of the jars towards the fire-pot and asked with pride\r\nand joy:\r\n\r\n\"And what is this?\"\r\n\r\nNell could scarcely believe her eyes, while he said hurriedly, with\r\nbeaming countenance:\r\n\r\n\"Now you will be well! I shall wrap up at once a large dose in a fresh\r\nfig peel and you must swallow it. And you shall see with what you will\r\ndrink it down. Why are you staring at me like at a green cat? Yes! I\r\nhave a second jar. I got both from a white man, whose camp is about\r\nfour miles from here. I have just returned from him. His name is Linde\r\nand he is wounded; nevertheless, he gave me a lot of good things. I\r\nwent to him on foot, but I returned on horseback. You may think it is\r\npleasant to go through the jungle at night. Brr! I would not go a\r\nsecond time for anything, unless I again needed quinine.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he left the astonished little maid while he went to the\r\n\"men's quarters,\" selected from a supply of figs the smallest one,\r\nhollowed it out, and filled the center with quinine, taking care that\r\nthe dose should not be greater than those powders which he had received\r\nin Khartûm. After which he left the tree, poured tea into a utensil\r\nwith water, and returned to Nell with the remedy.\r\n\r\nAnd during that time she reflected upon everything which had happened.\r\nShe was immensely curious as to who that white man was. From whence did\r\nStas get the information about him? Would he come to them, and would he\r\ntravel along with them? She did not doubt that since Stas had secured\r\nthe quinine she would regain her health. But Stas during the night-time\r\nwent through the jungle as if it were nothing. Nell, notwithstanding\r\nher admiration for him, had considered, not reflecting much over it,\r\nthat everything he did for her was to be taken as a matter of course,\r\nfor it is a plain thing that an older boy ought to protect a little\r\ngirl. But now it occurred to her that she would have perished long ago;\r\nthat he cared for her immensely; that he gratified her and defended her\r\nas no other boy of his age would have done or knew how to do. So great\r\ngratitude overflowed in her little heart, and when Stas entered again\r\nand leaned over her with the remedy she threw her thin arms around his\r\nneck and hugged him heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Stas, you are very kind to me.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he replied:\r\n\r\n\"And to whom am I to be kind? Why, I like that! Take this medicine!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless he was happy; as his eyes glistened with satisfaction and\r\nagain with joy and pride, he called, turning to the opening:\r\n\r\n\"Mea, serve the 'bibi' with tea, now!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nStas did not start for Linde's camp the following day until noon, for\r\nhe had to rest after the previous night's adventure. On the way,\r\nanticipating that the sick man might need fresh meat, he killed two\r\nguinea-fowl, which were really accepted with gratitude. Linde was very\r\nweak but fully conscious. Immediately after the greeting he inquired\r\nabout Nell, after which he warned Stas that he should not regard\r\nquinine as an entirely sure cure for the fever and that he should guard\r\nthe little one from the sun, from getting wet, from staying during the\r\nnight in low and damp places, and finally from bad water. Afterwards\r\nStas related to him, at his request, his own and Nell's history from\r\nthe beginning to the arrival in Khartûm and the visit to the Mahdi; and\r\nafterwards from Fashoda to their liberation from Gebhr's hands, and\r\ntheir further wanderings. The Swiss gazed during the time of this\r\nnarration with growing interest, often with evident admiration, and\r\nwhen the narrative reached an end he lit his pipe, surveyed Stas from\r\nhead to foot, and said as if in a reverie:\r\n\r\n\"If in your country there are many boys like you, then they will not be\r\nable to manage you very easily.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after a moment of silence he continued:\r\n\r\n\"The best proof of the truth of your words is this, that you are here,\r\nthat you are standing before me. And believe what I tell you: your\r\nsituation is terrible; the road, in any direction, is likewise\r\nterrible; who knows, however, whether such a boy as you will not save\r\nyourself and that child from this gulf.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Nell only will be well, then I shall do whatever I can,\" exclaimed\r\nStas.\r\n\r\n\"But spare yourself, for the task which you have before you is beyond\r\nthe strength of a mature person. Do you know where you are at present?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I remember that after our departure from Fashoda we crossed, near\r\na great settlement called Deng, some kind of a river.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sobat,\" interrupted Linde.\r\n\r\n\"In Deng there were quite a number of dervishes and negroes. But beyond\r\nSobat we entered into a region of jungles and proceeded whole weeks\r\nuntil we reached the ravine, in which you know what happened--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Afterwards you went along the ravine until you reached this\r\nriver. Now listen to me; it appears that after crossing the Sobat with\r\nthe Sudânese you turned to the southeast, but more to the south. You\r\nare at present in a locality unknown to travelers and geographers. The\r\nriver, near which we are at present, runs northwest, and in all\r\nprobability falls into the Nile. I say in all probability, for I myself\r\ndo not know and now cannot satisfy myself upon that point, though I\r\nturned from the Karamojo Mountains to investigate its source. After the\r\nbattle, I heard from the dervish prisoners that it is called Ogeloguen,\r\nbut even they were not certain, as they venture into this region only\r\nfor slaves. The Shilluk tribe occupy this generally sparsely settled\r\ncountry, but at present the region is desolate, as the population\r\npartly died of smallpox, partly was swept away by the Mahdists, and\r\npartly sought refuge in the Karamojo Mountains. In Africa it often\r\nhappens that a region thickly settled to-day becomes desolate\r\nto-morrow. According to my calculations you are a hundred and\r\neighty-six miles, more or less, from Lado. You might escape to the\r\nsouth to Emin, but as Emin himself is in all probability besieged by\r\nthe dervishes, that is not to be thought of.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to Abyssinia?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"That is also about the same distance away. Yet you must bear in mind\r\nthat the Mahdi is waging war against the whole world and, therefore,\r\nagainst Abyssinia. I know also from the prisoners that along the\r\nwestern and southern frontiers greater or smaller hordes of dervishes\r\nare prowling and you might therefore easily fall into their hands.\r\nAbyssinia indeed is a Christian empire, but the savage southern tribes\r\nare either pagan or profess Islam and for that reason secretly favor\r\nthe Mahdi,--No, you will not get through that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what am I to do, and where shall I go with Nell?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"I told you that your situation is extremely difficult,\" Linde said.\r\n\r\nSaying this he put both hands to his head and for a long time lay in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"The ocean,\" he finally said, \"is over five hundred and sixty miles\r\nfrom here; you would have to cross mountains, go among savage peoples,\r\nand even pass over deserts, for it is probable that there are waterless\r\nlocalities. But the country nominally belongs to England. You might\r\nchance upon transports of ivory to Kismayu, to Lamu and\r\nMombasa--perhaps upon missionary expeditions. Realizing that on account\r\nof the dervishes I would not be able to explore the course of this\r\nriver because it turns to the Nile, I, too, wanted to go eastward to\r\nthe ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall return together,\" Stas exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never return. The wart-hog has so badly torn my muscles and\r\nveins that an infection of the blood must set in. Only a surgeon could\r\nsave me by amputating my leg. Now everything has coagulated and become\r\nnumb, but during the first days I bit my hands from pain--\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely will get well.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my brave lad, I surely will die and you will cover me well with\r\nstones, so that the hyenas cannot dig me out. To the dead it may be all\r\nthe same, but during life it is unpleasant to think of it. It is hard\r\nto die so far away from your own--\"\r\n\r\nHere his eyes were dimmed as though with a mist, after which he\r\ncontinued thus:\r\n\r\n\"But I already have become resigned to the idea--so let us speak about\r\nyou, not about me. I will give you this advice. There remains for you\r\nonly the road to the east, to the ocean. But take a good rest before\r\nstarting and gain strength, otherwise your little companion will die in\r\nthe course of a few weeks. Postpone the journey until the end of the\r\nrainy season, and even longer. The first summer months, when the rain\r\nceases to fall and the water still covers the marshes, are the\r\nhealthiest. Here, where we are, is a plateau lying about twenty-two\r\nhundred and eighty-nine feet above the sea. At the height of forty-two\r\nhundred and fifty feet the fever does not exist and when brought from\r\nthe lower places its course is weaker. Take the little English girl up\r\ninto the mountains.\"\r\n\r\nTalking apparently fatigued him very much, so he again broke off and\r\nfor some time impatiently brushed away the big blue flies; the same\r\nkind as those which Stas saw among the burnt débris of Fashoda.\r\n\r\nAfter this he continued thus:\r\n\r\n\"Pay close attention to what I tell you. About a day's journey towards\r\nthe south there is an isolated mountain, not higher than twenty-six\r\nhundred and twenty feet; it looks like a pan turned upside down. Its\r\nsides are steep, and the only way of reaching it is by a rocky ridge so\r\nnarrow that in some places two horses can barely proceed on it side by\r\nside. On its flat top, which is about thirty-five hundred feet wide,\r\nthere was a negro village, but the Mahdists slaughtered and carried\r\naway the residents. It may be that this was done by that same Smain\r\nwhom I defeated, but those slaves I did not capture because he had\r\npreviously despatched them under an escort to the Nile. Settle on that\r\nmountain. There is a spring of excellent water, a few manioc fields,\r\nand a multitude of bananas. In the huts you will find a great many\r\nhuman bones, but do not fear infection from the corpses, as after the\r\ndervishes there were ants there, which drove us from the place. And\r\nnow, not a living creature! Remain in that village a month or two. At\r\nsuch a height there is no fever. Nights are cool. There your little one\r\nwill recover her health, and you will gain new strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what am I to do afterwards, and where shall I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"After that it will be as God disposes. Try to get through to Abyssinia\r\nin places situated farther than where the dervishes have reached, or\r\nride to the east--I heard that the coast Arabs are reaching some kind\r\nof lake in their search for ivory which they purchase from the Samburu\r\nand Wahima tribes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wahima? Kali comes from the Wahima tribe.\"\r\n\r\nHere Stas began to narrate to Linde the manner in which he inherited\r\nKali after Gebhr's death and that Kali had told him that he was the son\r\nof the ruler of all the Wahimas.\r\n\r\nBut Linde received this information more indifferently than Stas\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" he said, \"as he may be helpful to you. Among the\r\nblacks there are honest souls, though as a rule you cannot depend upon\r\ntheir gratitude; they are children who forget what happened the day\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali will not forget that I rescued him from Gebhr's hands, I am sure\r\nof that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Linde said, and pointing at Nasibu added: \"He also is a good\r\nchild; take him with you after my death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not speak of death, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy,\" answered the Swiss, \"I desire it--if it would only come\r\nwithout great agony; consider that now I am completely unarmed, and if\r\nany one of the Mahdists whom I routed should accidentally stray to this\r\nhollow, alone he could stab me like a sheep.\"\r\n\r\nHere he pointed to the sleeping negroes.\r\n\r\n\"They will not wake any more, or rather--I speak incorrectly--all of\r\nthem awake for a short time before their death and in their mental\r\naberration fly to the jungle, from which they never more return. Of two\r\nhundred men, sixty remained to me. Many ran away, many died of\r\nsmallpox, and some fell asleep in other ravines.\"\r\n\r\nStas with pity and awe began to gaze at the sleepers. Their bodies were\r\nashen-hued, which in negroes indicates paleness. Some had their eyes\r\nclosed, others half open; but these latter slept deeply, for their\r\neyeballs were not susceptible to the light. The knees of some were\r\nswollen. All were frightfully thin, so that their ribs could be counted\r\nthrough their skins. Their hands and feet quivered without cessation\r\nvery rapidly. The big blue flies swarmed thickly on their eyes and lips.\r\n\r\n\"Is there no help for them?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"There is none. On Victoria Nyanza this disease depopulates whole\r\nvillages. Sometimes more severely, sometimes less. It most frequently\r\ntakes hold of the people of the villages situated in the underwood on\r\nthe banks.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun had passed to the western sky, but still before night Linde had\r\nrelated to Stas his history. He was a son of a merchant of Zurich. His\r\nfamily came from Karlsruhe, but from the year 1848 had resided in\r\nSwitzerland. His father amassed a great fortune in the silk trade. He\r\neducated his son for an engineer, but young Henry was attracted from\r\nearly youth by travel. After completing his studies in a polytechnical\r\nschool, having inherited his father's entire fortune, he undertook his\r\nfirst journey to Egypt. It was before the Mahdi's time, so he reached\r\nas far as Khartûm, and hunted with Dongolese in the Sudân. After that\r\nhe devoted himself to the geography of Africa and acquired such an\r\nexpert knowledge of it that many geographical societies enrolled him\r\namong their members. This last journey, which was to end so\r\ndisastrously for him, began in Zanzibar. He had reached as far as the\r\nGreat Lakes and intended to penetrate into Abyssinia along the Karamojo\r\nMountains, which up to that time were unknown, and from there to\r\nproceed to the ocean coast. But the natives of Zanzibar refused to go\r\nany farther. Fortunately, or unfortunately, there was a war between the\r\nkings of Uganda and Unyoro. Linde rendered important services to the\r\nking of Uganda, who in exchange for them presented him with over two\r\nhundred bodyguards. This greatly facilitated the journey and the visit\r\nto the Karamojo Mountains, but afterwards smallpox appeared in the\r\nranks, after that the dreadful sleeping sickness, and finally the wreck\r\nof the caravan.\r\n\r\nLinde possessed considerable supplies of various kinds of preserved\r\nfood, but from fear of the scurvy he hunted every day for fresh meat.\r\nHe was an excellent shot but not a sufficiently careful sportsman, and\r\nit happened that when a few days before he thoughtlessly drew near a\r\nwild boar which had fallen from his shot, the beast started up and tore\r\nhis legs frightfully, and afterwards trampled upon his loins. This\r\nhappened near the camp and in the sight of Nasibu, who, tearing his\r\nshirt and making bandages of it, was able to check the flow of blood\r\nand lead the wounded man to the tent. In the foot, however, coagulum\r\nwas formed from the internal flow of blood and gangrene threatened the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nStas insisted upon dressing his wounds and announced that he would come\r\ndaily, or, so as not to leave Nell only under the care of the two\r\nblacks, he proposed to convey him to \"Cracow,\" on saddle-cloth,\r\nstretched between two horses.\r\n\r\nLinde agreed to the dressing of the wounds, but would not agree to the\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he said, pointing at the negroes, \"that those men must die,\r\nbut until they die, I cannot doom them to be torn to pieces alive by\r\nhyenas, which during the night-time are held back by the fire.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to repeat feverishly:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot! I cannot! I cannot!\"\r\n\r\nBut he became calm immediately, and continued in a strange voice:\r\n\r\n\"Come here to-morrow morning--I have a request to make of you, and if\r\nyou can perform it, God may lead you out of this African gulf, and\r\ngrant me an easy death. I wished to postpone this request until\r\nto-morrow, but as I may be unconscious to-morrow I make it to-day. Take\r\nwater in some utensil, stop before each one of those poor sleeping\r\nfellows, sprinkle water over him, and say these words: 'I baptize thee,\r\nin the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost!'\"\r\n\r\nHere emotion checked his speech and he became silent.\r\n\r\n\"I reproach myself,\" he said after a while, \"that I did not take leave\r\nin that manner of those who died of small-pox and of those who fell\r\ninto their final slumber. But now death is hovering over me, and I\r\ndesire to go together with even that remnant of my caravan upon the\r\nlast great journey.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this he pointed with his hand at the ruddy sky, and two tears\r\ncoursed slowly over his cheeks.\r\n\r\nStas wept like a beaver.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning's sun illuminated a strange spectacle. Stas walked\r\nalong the rocky walls, stopped before each negro, moistened his\r\nforehead with water, and pronounced over him the sacramental words. And\r\nthey slept with quivering hands and limbs, with heads drooping on their\r\nbreasts or tilted upwards, still alive but already resembling corpses.\r\nAnd thus took place this baptism of the sleepers--in the morning\r\nstillness, in the luster of the sun, in the desert gloom. The sky that\r\nday was cloudless, a grayish blue, and as though sad.\r\n\r\nLinde was still conscious, but grew weaker and weaker. After the wounds\r\nwere dressed, he handed to Stas papers enclosed in a tin case,\r\nentrusted them to his care, and said nothing more. He could not eat,\r\nbut thirst tormented him terribly. Before sunset he became delirious.\r\nHe shouted at some imaginary children not to sail too far away on some\r\nunknown lake, and afterwards fell into chills, and clasped his head\r\nwith both hands.\r\n\r\nOn the following day he did not recognize Stas at all, and at noon,\r\nthree days later, he died without recovering consciousness. Stas\r\nmourned for him sincerely, and afterwards with Kali carried him to a\r\nneighboring narrow cave, the opening of which they closed with thorns\r\nand stones.\r\n\r\nStas took little Nasibu to \"Cracow,\" while Kali was ordered to watch\r\nthe supplies at the camp and keep a big fire burning near the sleepers.\r\nStas bustled continually between the two ravines, conveying luggage and\r\nparticularly the rifle cartridges, from which he extracted powder and\r\nmade a mine for the purpose of blasting the rock which imprisoned the\r\nKing. Happily Nell's health improved considerably after daily doses of\r\nquinine, and the greater variety of food increased her strength. Stas\r\nleft her reluctantly and with fear, and on riding away would not permit\r\nher to leave the tree and closed the opening with thorny acacia boughs.\r\nOwing to the pressure of work which devolved upon him, he had to leave\r\nher, however, to the care of Mea, Nasibu, and Saba, upon whom after all\r\nhe depended the most. Rather than to leave her alone for any length of\r\ntime, he preferred to ride a score of times each day to Linde's camp\r\nfor the luggage. He also overworked himself terribly, but his iron\r\nconstitution endured all toil. Nevertheless, not until the tenth day\r\nwere all the packs distributed; those of less value were hidden in\r\ncaves, and those of more importance were brought to \"Cracow\"; the\r\nhorses, too, were led onto the promontory and a considerable number of\r\nRemington rifles were carried by them, which rifles were to be borne\r\nlater by the King.\r\n\r\nDuring that time in Linde's camp, from time to time, some of the\r\nsleeping negroes would start up in an ante-mortem paroxysm of the\r\ndisease, fly into the jungle, and return no more; there were some who\r\ndied on the spot, and others, rushing blindly, crushed their heads on\r\nthe rocks in the camp itself or in the neighborhood. These Kali had to\r\nbury. After two weeks only one remained, but that one soon died in his\r\nsleep from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nFinally the time arrived for blasting the rock and the liberation of\r\nthe King. He was so tame now that at Stas' order he seized him with his\r\ntrunk and placed him on his neck. He also had become accustomed to\r\nbearing things which Kali pulled on his back over a bamboo ladder. Nell\r\ninsisted that he was too heavily burdened, but in truth to him it was\r\nlike a fly, and only the luggage inherited from Linde could form a\r\nrespectable load for him. With Saba, at the sight of whom in the\r\nbeginning he displayed uneasiness, he became quite friendly, and played\r\nwith him in this manner: he would overturn him on the ground with his\r\ntrunk, and Saba would pretend that he was biting. At times, however, he\r\nwould unexpectedly souse the dog with water, which act was regarded by\r\nthe latter as a joke of the poorest taste.\r\n\r\nThe children were principally pleased because the beast, being quick of\r\ncomprehension and seriously minded, understood everything that was\r\nwanted of him and seemed to comprehend, not only every order, but even\r\nevery nod. In this respect elephants surpass immeasurably all other\r\ndomesticated animals, and the King, beyond comparison, surpassed Saba,\r\nwho wagged his tail to all of Nell's admonitions and afterwards did\r\nwhatever he pleased. The King discerned perfectly, for instance, that\r\nthe person whom it was most necessary to obey was Stas, and that the\r\nperson about whom all cared the most was Nell. So he most carefully\r\ncomplied with Stas' orders, and loved Nell the most. To Kali he paid\r\nless heed and Mea he slighted entirely.\r\n\r\nStas, after making the mine, inserted it in the deepest fissure, after\r\nwhich he plastered it wholly with clay, leaving only a small opening\r\nthrough which hung a fuse twisted of dry palm fiber and rubbed with\r\nfine powder. The decisive moment finally arrived. Stas personally lit\r\nthe powdered rope, after which he ran as far as his legs could carry\r\nhim to the tree in which previously he had fastened all the others.\r\nNell was afraid that the King might be frightened too much, but the boy\r\ncalmed her first with the statement that he had selected a day on which\r\nthe morning was accompanied by a thunderstorm, and then with the\r\nassurance that wild elephants often hear the peal of thunder when the\r\nheavenly elements are unfettered over the jungle.\r\n\r\nThey sat, however, with palpitating hearts, counting minute after\r\nminute. A terrific roar so agitated the atmosphere that the sturdy\r\nbaobab tree shook from top to bottom and remnants of the unscraped\r\ndecayed wood poured upon their heads. Stas, at that moment, jumped out\r\nof the tree and, avoiding the bends of the ravine, ran to the\r\npassageway.\r\n\r\nThe results of the explosion appeared extraordinary. One half of the\r\nlime rock was reduced to minute fragments; the other half had burst\r\ninto about a score of greater or smaller pieces, which the force of the\r\nexplosion scattered to quite a distance.\r\n\r\nThe elephant was free.\r\n\r\nThe overjoyed boy now rushed to the edge of the ravine, where he found\r\nNell with Mea and Kali. The King was startled a little and, retreating\r\nto the very brink of the ravine, stood with uplifted trunk, gazing in\r\nthe direction from which came the sound of such unusual thunder. But\r\nwhen Nell began to call to him, when she came to him through the\r\npassageway, already opened, he became entirely quiet. More startled\r\nthan the King were the horses, of which two dashed into the jungle, and\r\nit was not until sunset that Kali caught them.\r\n\r\nThat very same day Nell led the King \"out into the world.\" The colossus\r\nfollowed her obediently, like a little puppy, and afterwards bathed in\r\nthe river, and alone secured his supper in this singular manner:\r\nbracing his head against a big sycamore tree, he broke it like a feeble\r\nreed and afterwards carefully nibbled the fruit and the leaves.\r\n\r\nTowards evening he returned, however, to the tree, and shoving, every\r\nlittle while, his enormous nose through an opening, sought for Nell so\r\nzealously and persistently that Stas finally was compelled to give his\r\ntrunk a sound smack.\r\n\r\nKali, however, was the most overjoyed with the result of that day, for\r\nupon his shoulders had fallen the work of gathering provisions for the\r\ngiant, which was by no means an easy task. So then Stas and Nell heard\r\nhim, while lighting the fire for supper, sing a new hymn of joy,\r\ncomposed of the following words:\r\n\r\n\"The great master kills men and lions. Yah! Yah! The great master\r\ncrushes rocks. Yah! Yah! The elephant, himself, breaks trees and Kali\r\ncan be idle and eat. Yah! Yah!\"\r\n\r\nThe rainy season, or the so-called \"massica,\" was drawing to an end.\r\nThere were yet cloudy and rainy days, but there were also days entirely\r\nclear. Stas decided to remove to the mountain indicated to him by\r\nLinde, and this purpose he carried out soon after the King's\r\nliberation. Nell's health did not present any obstacles now, as she\r\nfelt decidedly better.\r\n\r\nSelecting, therefore, a clear day, they started at noon. They were not\r\nafraid now that they would stray, as the boy had inherited from Linde,\r\namong various articles, a compass and an excellent field-glass, through\r\nwhich it was easy to descry distant localities. Besides Saba and the\r\ndonkey they were accompanied by five pack-horses and the elephant. The\r\nlatter, besides the luggage on his back, on his neck bore Nell, who\r\nbetween his two enormous ears looked as though she were sitting in a\r\nbig arm-chair. Stas without regret abandoned the promontory and the\r\nbaobab tree, for it was associated with the recollection of Nell's\r\nillness. On the other hand, the little girl gazed with sad eyes at the\r\nrocks, at the trees, at the waterfall, and announced that she would\r\nreturn there when she should be \"big.\"\r\n\r\nSadder still was little Nasibu, who had loved sincerely his former\r\nmaster, and, at present riding on the donkey in the rear, he turned\r\naround every little while and looked with tears in his eyes towards the\r\nplace where poor Linde would remain until the day of the great judgment.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew from the north and the day was unusually cool. Thanks to\r\nthis they did not have to stop and wait from ten to three, until the\r\ngreatest heat was over, and they could travel a longer distance than is\r\ncustomary with caravans. The road was not long, and a few hours before\r\nsunset Stas espied the mountain towards which they were bound. In the\r\ndistance on the background of the sky was outlined a long chain of\r\nother peaks, and this mountain rose nearer and lonely, like an island\r\nin a jungle sea. When they rode closer it appeared that its steep sides\r\nwere washed by a loop of the river near which they previously had\r\nsettled. The top was perfectly flat, and seen from below appeared to be\r\ncovered by one dense forest. Stas computed that since the promontory,\r\non which their baobab tree grew, was about twenty-three hundred feet\r\nhigh and the mountain about twenty-six hundred feet, they would dwell\r\nat an elevation of about forty-nine hundred feet and in a climate not\r\nmuch warmer, therefore, than that of Egypt. This thought encouraged him\r\nand urged him to take possession of this natural fortress as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThey easily found the only rocky ridge which led to it and began the\r\nascent. After the lapse of half an hour they stood on the summit. That\r\nforest seen from below was really a forest--but of bananas. The sight\r\nof them delighted all exceedingly, not excepting the King, and Stas was\r\nparticularly pleased, for he knew that there is not in Africa a more\r\nnourishing and healthy food nor a better preventative of all ailments\r\nthan the flour of dried banana fruit. There were so many of them that\r\nthey would suffice even for a year.\r\n\r\nAmidst the immense leaves of these plants was hidden the negro village;\r\nmost of the huts had been burned or ruined at the time of the attack,\r\nbut some were still whole. In the center stood the largest, belonging\r\nat one time to the king of the village; it was prettily made of clay,\r\nwith a wide roof forming around the walls a sort of veranda. Before the\r\nhuts lay here and there human bones and skeletons, white as chalk, for\r\nthey had been cleaned by the ants of whose invasion Linde spoke. From\r\nthe time of the invasion many weeks had already elapsed; nevertheless,\r\nin the huts could be smelt the leaven of ants, and one could find in\r\nthem neither the big black cock-roaches, which usually swarm in all\r\nnegro hovels, nor spiders nor scorpions nor the smallest of insects.\r\n\r\nEverything had been cleaned out by the terrible \"siafu.\" It was also a\r\ncertainty that there was not on the whole mountain-top a single snake,\r\nas even boas fall prey to these invincible little warriors.\r\n\r\nAfter conducting Nell and Mea into the chief's hut, Stas ordered Kali\r\nand Nasibu to remove the human bones. The black boys carried out this\r\norder by flinging them into the river, which carried them farther.\r\nWhile thus employed, however, they found that Linde was mistaken in\r\ndeclaring that they would not find a living creature on the mountain.\r\nThe silence which reigned after the seizure of the people by the\r\ndervishes and the sight of the bananas had allured a great number of\r\nchimpanzees which built for themselves, on the loftier trees, something\r\nlike umbrellas or roofs, for protection against rain. Stas did not want\r\nto kill them, but decided to drive them away, and with this object in\r\nview he fired a shot into the air. This produced a general panic, which\r\nincreased still more when after the shot Saba's furious bass barking\r\nresounded, and the King, incited by the noise, trumpeted threateningly.\r\nBut the apes, to make a retreat, did not need to seek the rocky ridge;\r\nthey dashed over the broken rocks towards the river and the trees\r\ngrowing near it with such rapidity that Saba's fangs could not reach\r\nany of them.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set. Kali and Nasibu built a fire to prepare for supper.\r\nStas, after unpacking the necessary articles for the night, repaired to\r\nthe king's hut, which was occupied by Nell. It was light and cheerful\r\nin the hut, for Mea had lit, not the fire-pot which had illuminated the\r\ninterior of the baobab tree, but a large traveling lamp inherited from\r\nLinde. Nell did not at all feel fatigued from the journey in a day so\r\ncool, and fell into perfect good humor, especially when Stas announced\r\nthat the human bones, which she feared, had been taken away.\r\n\r\n\"How nice it is here!\" she exclaimed. \"Look, even the floor is covered\r\nwith resin. It will be fine here.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow I shall fully examine our possessions,\" he answered;\r\n\"judging, however, by what I have seen to-day, one could dwell here all\r\nhis life.\"\r\n\r\n\"If our papas were here, then we could. But how will you name this\r\npossession?\"\r\n\r\n\"The mountain ought to be called Mount Linde in geographies; and let\r\nthis village be named after you, Nell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall be in the geographies?\" asked she with great glee.\r\n\r\n\"You will, you will,\" Stas replied in all seriousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day it rained a little, but there were hours when the weather\r\nwas clear, so Stas early in the morning started to visit his\r\npossessions and at noon had viewed thoroughly all the nooks. The\r\ninspection on the whole created a favorable impression. First, in\r\nrespect to safety, Mount Linde was as though the chosen spot of all\r\nAfrica. Its sides were accessible only to chimpanzees. Neither lions\r\nnor panthers could climb over its precipitous sides. As to the rocky\r\nridge, it was sufficient to place the King at its entrances to be able\r\nto sleep safely on both ears. Stas came to the conclusion that there he\r\ncould repulse even a small division of dervishes, as the road leading\r\nto the mountain was so narrow that the King could barely pass on it and\r\na man armed with a good weapon need not permit a living soul to reach\r\nthe top. In the middle of the \"island\" gushed a spring, cool and pure\r\nas crystal, which changed into a stream and, running sinuously amid the\r\nbanana groves, finally fell over the steep hanging rocks to the river,\r\nforming a narrow waterfall resembling a white tape. On the southern\r\nside of the \"island\" lay a field, covered abundantly with manioc, the\r\nroots of which supply the negroes with their favorite food, and beyond\r\nthe fields towered immeasurably high cocoa palms with crowns in the\r\nshape of magnificent plumes of feathers.\r\n\r\nThe \"island\" was surrounded by a sea of jungle and the view from it\r\nextended over an immense expanse. From the east loomed lividly the\r\nKaramojo Mountain chain. On the south could also be seen considerable\r\nelevations, which, to judge from their dark hue, were covered with\r\nforests. On the other hand, on the western side the view ran as far as\r\nthe horizon's boundary, at which the jungle met the sky. Stas descried,\r\nhowever, with the help of the field-glass, numerous hollows and,\r\nscattered sparsely, mighty trees rising above the grass like churches.\r\nIn places, where the grasses had not yet shot up too high, could be\r\nperceived even with the naked eye whole herds of antelopes and zebras\r\nor groups of elephants and buffaloes. Here and there giraffes cut\r\nthrough the dark green surface of the sea of grass. Close by the river\r\na dozen or more water-bucks disported and others every little while\r\nthrust their horny heads out of the depths. In one place where the\r\nwater was calm, fishes like those which Kali had caught leaped every\r\nlittle while out of the water, and, twinkling in the air like silvery\r\nstars, fell again into the river. Stas promised to himself to bring\r\nNell there when the weather had settled and show her this whole\r\nmenagerie.\r\n\r\nOn the \"island,\" on the other hand, there were none of the larger\r\nanimals; instead there were a great number of butterflies and birds.\r\nBig parrots, white as snow, with black beaks and yellow crests flew\r\nabove the bushes of the grove; tiny, wonderfully plumaged widow-birds\r\nswung on the thin manioc stalks, changing color and glittering like\r\njewels, and from the high cocoa trees came the sounds of the African\r\ncuckoos and the gentle cooing of the turtle-dove.\r\n\r\nStas returned from his inspection trip with joy in his soul. \"The\r\nclimate,\" he said, \"is healthy; the security is perfect, the provisions\r\nare abundant, and the place is as beautiful as Paradise.\" Returning to\r\nNell's hut he learned to his surprise that there were larger animals on\r\nthe \"island\"; two, in fact, for little Nasibu had discovered in a\r\nbanana thicket while Stas was absent a goat with a kid, which the\r\ndervishes had overlooked. The goat was a little wild, but the kid at\r\nonce became friendly with Nasibu, who was immeasurably proud of his\r\ndiscovery and of the fact that through his instrumentality \"bibi\" would\r\nnow have excellent fresh milk daily.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do now, Stas?\" Nell asked one day, when she had settled\r\ndown for good to her housekeeping on the \"island.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is plenty of work to do,\" the boy answered, after which,\r\nspreading out the fingers of one hand, he began to count on them all\r\nthe work awaiting them.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place Kali and Mea are pagans, and Nasibu, as a native of\r\nZanzibar, is a Mohammedan. It is necessary to enlighten them, teach\r\nthem the faith, and baptize them. Then, it is necessary to smoke meat\r\nfor our future journey and therefore I must go hunting; thirdly, having\r\na good supply of rifles and cartridges, I want to teach Kali to shoot\r\nin order that there shall be two of us to defend you; and fourthly--you\r\nprobably forgot about the kites?\"\r\n\r\n\"About the kites?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, those which you will glue, or better still, you will sew. That\r\nshall be your work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to play only.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't be all play, but work most useful for all. Don't think that\r\nit will end with one kite for you must be ready for fifty or more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why so many?\" asked the girl, whose curiosity was aroused.\r\n\r\nSo Stas began to explain his plans and hopes. He would write on each\r\nkite their names, how they had escaped from the hands of the dervishes,\r\nwhere they were, and whither they were bound. He would also inscribe a\r\nrequest for help and that a message be despatched to Port Said. After\r\nthat he would fly these kites every time the wind was blowing from the\r\nwest to the east.\r\n\r\n\"Many of them,\" he said, \"will fall not far off; many will be stopped\r\nby the mountains, but let only one of them fly to the coast and fall\r\ninto European hands--then we are saved.\"\r\n\r\nNell was enchanted with the idea and announced that in comparison with\r\nthe wisdom of Stas not even that of the King could be mentioned. She\r\nalso was quite certain that a multitude of the kites would fly even to\r\ntheir papas, and she promised to glue them from morning until night.\r\nHer joy was so great that Stas, from fear that she might get a fever,\r\nwas compelled to restrain her ardor.\r\n\r\nAnd from that time the work that Stas spoke of began in earnest. Kali,\r\nwho was ordered to catch as many leaping fish as possible, ceased to\r\ncatch them on a line and instead made a high fence of thin bamboo, or\r\nrather something in the nature of a trellis, and this sluice he pulled\r\nacross the river. In the middle of the trellis was a big opening\r\nthrough which the fishes had to swim in order to get into the free\r\nwater. In this opening Kali placed a strong net plaited of tough palm\r\nropes, and in this manner was assured of a bountiful catch.\r\n\r\nHe drove fish into the treacherous net with the help of the King, who,\r\nled into the water, muddied and stirred it so that not only those\r\nsilvery leapers but all other creatures vanished as far as they could\r\nto an unmuddied depth. On account of this, some damage also occurred,\r\nas several times escaping crocodiles overturned the trellis, or at\r\ntimes the King did this himself; cherishing for crocodiles some sort of\r\ninbred hatred, he pursued them, and when they were in shallow waters he\r\nseized them with his trunk, tossed them onto the bank, and trampled\r\nupon them furiously. They found also in the nets tortoises, from which\r\nthe young exiles made an excellent broth. Kali dressed the fish and\r\ndried them in the sun, while the bladders were taken to Nell, who cut\r\nthem open, stretched them upon a board, and changed them into sheets as\r\nlarge as the palms of two hands.\r\n\r\nShe was assisted at this by Stas and Mea, as the work was not at all\r\neasy. The membranes were thicker, indeed, than that of the bladders of\r\nour river fish, but after drying up they became very frail. Stas after\r\nsome time discovered that they ought to be dried in the shade. At\r\ntimes, however, he lost patience, and if he did not abandon the design\r\nof making kites from the membranes it was because he regarded them as\r\nlighter than paper and of better proof against rain.\r\n\r\nThe dry season of the year was already approaching, but he was\r\nuncertain whether rain did not fall during the summer particularly in\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nHowever, he glued kites with paper, of which a large amount was found\r\namong Linde's effects. The first one, big and light, was let go in a\r\nwestern wind; it shot up at once very high, and when Stas cut the\r\nstring, flew, carried by a powerful current of air, to the Karamojo\r\nmountain chain. Stas watched its flight with the aid of the field-glass\r\nuntil it became as small as a butterfly, a little speck, and until\r\nfinally it dissolved in the pale azure of the sky. The following day he\r\nlet go others made of fish bladder, which shot up still higher, but on\r\naccount of the transparency of the membranes soon disappeared entirely\r\nfrom view.\r\n\r\nNell worked, however, with extraordinary zeal, and in the end her\r\nlittle fingers acquired such skill that neither Stas nor Mea could keep\r\nup with her work. She did not lack strength now. The salubrious climate\r\nof Mount Linde simply regenerated her. The period during which the\r\nfatal third attack could come, had definitely passed. That day Stas hid\r\nhimself in a banana thicket and wept from joy. After a fortnight's stay\r\non the mountain he observed that the \"Good Mzimu\" looked entirely\r\ndifferent from what she did below in the jungle. Her cheeks were\r\nplumper, her complexion from yellow and transparent became rosy again,\r\nand from under the abundant tufts of hair, merry eyes full of luster\r\ngazed upon the world. The boy blessed the cool nights, the translucent\r\nspring-water, the flour of dried bananas, and, above all, Linde.\r\n\r\nHe himself became lean and swarthy, which was evidence that the fever\r\nwould not take hold of him, as sufferers from that disease do not tan\r\nfrom the sun--and he was growing up and becoming manly. Activity and\r\nphysical labor intensified his bravery and strength. The muscles of his\r\nhands and limbs became like steel. Indeed, he was already a hardened\r\nAfrican traveler. Hunting daily and shooting only with bullets, he\r\nbecame also a matchless shot.\r\n\r\nHe did not at all fear the wild animals, for he understood that it was\r\nmore dangerous for the shaggy-haired and the spotted hunters of the\r\njungle to meet him than for him to meet them. Once he killed with a\r\nsingle shot a big rhinoceros, which, aroused from a light nap under an\r\nacacia, charged at him unexpectedly. He treated with indifference the\r\naggressive African buffaloes, which at times disperse whole caravans.\r\n\r\nAside from the gluing of kites and other daily engagements, he and Nell\r\nalso began the work of converting Kali, Mea, and Nasibu. But it was\r\nharder than they expected. The black trio listened most willingly to\r\nthe instructions, but received them in their own negro way. When Stas\r\ntold them of the creation of the world, about paradise and about the\r\nsnake, the teaching proceeded fairly well, but when he related how Cain\r\nkilled Abel, Kali involuntarily stroked his stomach and asked quite\r\ncalmly:\r\n\r\n\"Did he eat him afterwards?\"\r\n\r\nThe black boy always claimed, indeed, that the Wahimas never ate\r\npeople, but evidently memory of that custom still lingered among them\r\nas a national tradition.\r\n\r\nHe likewise could not understand why God did not kill the wicked\r\n\"Mzimu,\" and many similar things. His conception of good and evil was\r\ntoo African; in consequence of which there once occurred between the\r\nteacher and pupil this colloquy:\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" asked Stas, \"what is a wicked deed?\"\r\n\r\n\"If any one takes away Kali's cow,\" he answered after a brief\r\nreflection, \"that then is a wicked deed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!\" exclaimed Stas, \"and what is a good one?\"\r\n\r\nThis time the answer came without any reflection:\r\n\r\n\"If Kali takes away the cow of somebody else, that is a good deed.\"\r\n\r\nStas was too young to perceive that similar views of evil and good\r\ndeeds were enunciated in Europe not only by politicians but by whole\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, slowly, very slowly, the light dawned in their benighted\r\nminds, and that which they could not comprehend with their heads they\r\nunderstood with their warm hearts. After a time they were fitted for\r\nthe baptismal rites, which were performed with great solemnity. The\r\ngod-parents gave to each child sixteen yards of white percale and a\r\nstring of blue beads. Mea, nevertheless, felt somewhat disappointed,\r\nfor in the simplicity of her soul she thought that after the baptism\r\nher skin would at once turn white, and great was her astonishment when\r\nshe observed that she remained as black as before. Nell comforted her,\r\nhowever, with the assurance that now she possessed a white soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nStas instructed Kali also how to shoot from a Remington rifle, and this\r\ninstruction proceeded more easily than the teaching of the catechism.\r\nAfter ten days' shooting at a mark and at crocodiles which slept on the\r\nsandy river banks, the young negro killed a big antelope cob; after\r\nthat a few ariels and finally a wart-hog. The encounter with the\r\nlatter, however, almost resulted in the same kind of accident which\r\nbefell Linde, for the wart-hog, which Kali approached carelessly after\r\nthe shot, started up suddenly and charged at him with tail upraised.\r\nKali, flinging away the rifle, sought refuge in a tree, where he sat\r\nuntil his cries brought Stas, who, however, found the wild boar already\r\ndead. Stas did not yet permit the boy to hunt for buffaloes, lions, and\r\nrhinoceroses. He himself did not shoot at the elephants which came to\r\nthe watering place, because he had promised Nell that he would never\r\nkill one.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, in the morning or during the afternoon hours, from above\r\nhe espied, through the field-glass, herds of zebras, hartbeests,\r\nariels, or springboks grazing in the jungle, he took Kali with him.\r\nDuring these excursions he often questioned the boy about the Wahima\r\nand Samburu nations, with which, desiring to go eastward, to the ocean\r\ncoast, they necessarily must come in contact.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Kali,\" he asked a certain day, \"that after twenty days on\r\nhorseback we could reach your country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali does not know where the Wahimas live,\" the young negro answered,\r\nsadly shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\"But I know that they live in the direction in which the sun rises in\r\nthe morning, near some great water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! Yes!\" exclaimed the boy with amazement and joy; \"Basso-Narok!\r\nThat in our language means, great and black water. The great master\r\nknows everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, for I do not know how the Wahimas would receive us if we came to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali would command them to fall on their faces before the great master\r\nand before the 'Good Mzimu.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And would they obey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali's father wears a leopard's hide--and Kali, too.\" Stas understood\r\nthis to mean that Kali's father was a king, and that Kali was his\r\noldest son and the future ruler of the Wahimas.\r\n\r\nSo he continued to ask further:\r\n\r\n\"You told me that white travelers visited you and that the older people\r\nremember them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and Kali has heard that they had a great deal of percale on their\r\nheads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" thought Stas, \"so those were not Europeans, but Arabs, whom the\r\nnegroes on account of their lighter complexion and white dress mistook\r\nfor white men.\"\r\n\r\nInasmuch, however, as Kali did not remember them and could not give any\r\nmore specific details about them, Stas propounded to him other\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\"Have not the Wahimas killed any of these men dressed in white?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! Neither the Wahimas nor the Samburus can do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"For they said that if their blood should soak into the ground the rain\r\nwould cease to fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear that they believe so.\"\r\n\r\nStas thought for a while, after which he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Would the Wahimas go with us to the sea, if I promised them a big\r\nquantity of percale, beads, and rifles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali goes and the Wahimas also, but the great master would first have\r\nto subdue the Samburus, who are settled on the other side of the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who lives beyond the Samburus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beyond the Samburus there are no mountains, and there is a jungle, and\r\nin it lions.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the conversation ended. Stas more and more frequently thought\r\nof the great journey towards the east, remembering that Linde had said\r\nthat they might meet coast Arabs trading in ivory, and perhaps a\r\nmissionary expedition. He knew that such a journey would be a series of\r\nterrible hardships for Nell and full of new dangers, but he realized\r\nthat they could not remain all their lives on Mount Linde and it was\r\nnecessary to start soon on the journey. The time, after the rainy\r\nseason, when water covers the pestilential swamps, and is to be found\r\neverywhere, was the most suitable for the purpose. The heat could not\r\nyet be felt on the high table-land; the nights were so cool still that\r\nit was necessary to be well covered. But in the jungle below it was\r\nconsiderably hotter, and he knew well that intense heat would soon\r\ncome. The rain now seldom bedewed the earth and the water level in the\r\nriver lowered daily. Stas assumed that in summer the river would change\r\ninto one of those \"khors,\" of which he saw many in the Libyan Desert,\r\nand that only in the very middle of it would flow a narrow stream of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he postponed the departure from day to day. On Mount\r\nLinde it was so well with all, themselves as well as the animals! Nell\r\nnot only was rid of the fever but of anaemia also; Stas' head never\r\nached; Kali's and Mea's skins began to shine like black satin; Nasibu\r\nlooked like a melon walking on thin legs, and the King, no less than\r\nthe horses and the donkey, grew fat. Stas well knew that they would not\r\nuntil the end of the journey find another island like this amidst the\r\njungle sea. And he viewed the future with fear; moreover, they had in\r\nthe King great assistance and in case of necessity a defense.\r\n\r\nThus a week more elapsed before they commenced preparations for the\r\njourney. In moments free from packing their effects they did not cease,\r\nhowever, to send out kites with the announcement that they were going\r\neastward towards some lake, and towards the ocean. They continued to\r\nfly them because they were favored by a strong western wind, resembling\r\nat times a hurricane, which seized and carried them to the mountains\r\nand far beyond the mountains. In order to protect Nell from the\r\nscorching heat, Stas constructed from pieces of a tent a palanquin in\r\nwhich the little maid was to ride on the elephant. The King, after a\r\nfew trials, became accustomed to this not great burden, as well as to\r\nthe fastening of the palanquin on his back with strong palm ropes. This\r\nload after all was a feather in comparison to others with which it was\r\nintended to burden him and upon the distribution and tying of which\r\nKali and Mea were engaged.\r\n\r\nLittle Nasibu was commissioned to dry bananas and grind them into flour\r\nbetween two flat stones. At the plucking of the heavy bunches of fruit\r\nhe was assisted by the King, at which work they overfed themselves to\r\nsuch an extent that, in the neighborhood of the huts, bananas were soon\r\nentirely gone, and they had to go to another plantation lying on the\r\nopposite extremity of the table-land. Saba, who had nothing to do, most\r\nfrequently accompanied them on these excursions.\r\n\r\nBut Nasibu, for his zeal, almost paid with his life, or at least with\r\ncaptivity of a singular kind. For it happened that once when he was\r\nplucking bananas above the brink of a steep hanging rock he suddenly\r\nbeheld in the rocky gap a hideous face, covered with black hair,\r\nblinking at him with its eyes, and displaying white fangs as though\r\nsmiling. The boy was stupefied from terror at first and then began to\r\nscurry away as fast as his legs could carry him. He ran between ten and\r\ntwenty paces when a hairy arm wound around him, he was lifted off his\r\nfeet, and the monster, black as night, began to fly with him to the\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nFortunately the gigantic ape, having seized the boy, could run only on\r\ntwo feet, in consequence of which Saba, who was in the vicinity, easily\r\novertook it and buried his fangs in its back. A horrible fight began,\r\nin which the dog, notwithstanding his powerful stature and strength,\r\nwould surely have had to succumb, for a gorilla vanquishes even a lion.\r\nSimians as a rule, however, do not relinquish their quarry even though\r\ntheir lives and liberty are in danger. The gorilla, being caught from\r\nbehind, could not easily reach Saba; nevertheless, having grabbed him\r\nby the neck with its left hand it had already raised him, when the\r\nground gave a dull sound under heavy steps and the King appeared.\r\n\r\nOne light thwack with the trunk sufficed to prostrate with a shattered\r\nskull and neck the terrible \"forest demon,\" as the negroes call the\r\ngorilla. The King, however, for greater certainty or through inborn\r\nfury, pinned the gorilla with his tusks to the ground and afterwards\r\ndid not cease to wreak his vengeance upon it until Stas, disquieted by\r\nthe roar and howling, came running up with a rifle and ordered him to\r\nstop.\r\n\r\nThe huge gorilla, with the whites of the eyes rolled up and fangs\r\ndisplayed, terrible still, though not alive, lay in a puddle of blood\r\nwhich Saba lapped and which crimsoned the King's tusks. The elephant\r\ntrumpeted triumphantly and Nasibu, ashen from terror, related to Stas\r\nwhat had happened. The latter pondered for a while whether or not to\r\nbring Nell and show her this monstrous ape, but abandoned the\r\nintention, for suddenly he was seized by fear. Of course, Nell often\r\nstrolled alone over the island. So something similar might befall her.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, therefore, that Mount Linde was not so safe a shelter as\r\nit seemed in the first instance.\r\n\r\nStas returned to the hut and related the incident to Nell, while she\r\nlistened with curiosity and fear, opening wide her eyes and repeating\r\nevery little while:\r\n\r\n\"You see what would have happened without the King.\"\r\n\r\n\"True! With such a nurse one need not fear about a child. So then,\r\nuntil we leave, do not move a step without him.\"\r\n\r\n\"When shall we leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"The supplies are ready; the packs distributed; so it is necessary only\r\nto load the animals and we can start even to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"To our papas!\"\r\n\r\n\"If God permits,\" Stas answered gravely.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they did not start until several days after this\r\nconversation. The departure, after a short prayer in which they warmly\r\ncommended themselves to God, took place at daybreak, six o'clock in the\r\nmorning. Stas rode at the head, on horseback, preceded by Saba. After\r\nhim the King ambled gravely, moving his ears and bearing on his\r\npowerful back a canvas palanquin and in the palanquin Nell with Mea;\r\nthey were followed by Linde's horses one after another, tied together\r\nwith a long palm rope and carrying numerous packs; and the procession\r\nclosed with little Nasibu on the donkey, as fat as himself.\r\n\r\nOn account of the early hour, the heat was not at first oppressive,\r\nthough the day was clear and from beyond the Karamojo Mountains the sun\r\nrolled magnificently, not shaded by a cloudlet. But an eastern breeze\r\nmollified the intense heat of its rays. At moments there rose quite a\r\nstrong wind, under whose breath the grass lay low and the whole jungle\r\nbecame wavy like the sea. After the copious rains all vegetation grew\r\nso exuberantly that, in lower places especially, not only the horses\r\nwere hidden in the grass, but even the King; so that above the waving\r\ngreen surface could be seen only the white palanquin, which moved\r\nforward like a launch on a lake. After an hour's journey, on a dry, not\r\nhigh elevation, they chanced upon gigantic thistles having stems as\r\nthick as the trunk of a tree and flowers the size of a man's head. On\r\nthe sides of some mountains which from a distance appeared barren they\r\nsaw furze-bushes about twenty-six feet high. Other plants which in\r\nEurope belong to the smallest varieties assumed here proportions\r\ncorresponding to the thistles and furze-bushes; and gigantic, isolated\r\ntrees rose above the jungle, looking like churches. Particularly\r\nprominent were fig-trees, called \"daro,\" whose weeping boughs, touching\r\nthe ground and changing into new trunks, covered immense spaces, so\r\nthat each tree formed as it were a separate grove.\r\n\r\nThis region, from a distance, seemed like one forest; nearer, however,\r\nit appeared that the great trees grew a dozen or even some score paces\r\napart. In the northern direction very few of them could be seen and the\r\nregion assumed the character of a mountainous steppe, covered with an\r\neven jungle over which rose only umbrella-like acacias. The grass there\r\nwas more greenish, shorter, and evidently better for pasturage, for\r\nNell from the King's back and Stas from heights on which he rode, saw\r\nfar greater herds of antelopes than up to that time they had met\r\nelsewhere. The animals sometimes grazed alone and at times mingled\r\ntogether; gnus, cobs, ariels, antelope-cows, hartbeests, springboks,\r\nand great kudus. Zebras and giraffes also were not lacking. The herds,\r\nat the sight of the caravan, stopped feeding, raised their heads, and\r\npricking their ears, gazed at the white palanquin with extraordinary\r\namazement, after which in a moment they scampered away, and having run\r\nbetween ten and twenty paces they again stood still, staring at this\r\nobject unknown to them, until, having gratified their curiosity, they\r\nbegan to graze calmly. From time to time a rhinoceros started up\r\nsuddenly before the caravan with a crash and in a rage, but in spite of\r\nits impetuous nature and its readiness to attack everything which comes\r\nwithin range of its vision, it ran away shamefully at the sight of the\r\nKing, whom only the commands of Stas restrained from pursuit.\r\n\r\nAn African elephant detests a rhinoceros, and if he finds its fresh\r\ntracks, trusting to superior strength, he follows until he finds his\r\nadversary and commences a combat in which the rhinoceros is almost\r\nalways the victim. It was not easy for the King, who undoubtedly was\r\nalready responsible for the death of many, to renounce this habit, but\r\nnow he was so tame and was so accustomed to regard Stas as his master,\r\nthat hearing his voice and observing the threatening look in his eyes,\r\nhe dropped his uplifted trunk and walked ahead quietly. Stas did not\r\nlack a desire to witness a fight between giants, but he feared for\r\nNell. If the elephant started on a full run, the palanquin might be\r\nwrecked, and what is worse, the huge beast might bump it against a\r\nbough, and then Nell's life would be in terrible danger. Stas knew from\r\ndescriptions of hunts which he had read in Port Said that the\r\ntiger-hunters in India fear, more than the tigers, that the elephant in\r\na panic or in pursuit may dash the howdah against a tree. Finally, the\r\nfull run of the giant is so heavy that no one without impairment of his\r\nhealth could long endure such rides.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the presence of the King removed a multitude of\r\ndangers. The malignant and bold buffaloes, which they met that day\r\nbound for the little lake at which all the animals of the vicinity\r\ngathered at evening, also scampered away at sight of him and, making a\r\ncircuit of the whole lake, drank on the other side. At night the King,\r\nwith one hind leg tied to a tree, guarded the tent in which Nell slept.\r\nThis was a watch so secure that though Stas ordered a fire to be built,\r\nhe regarded the erection of a zareba as a superfluous precaution,\r\nthough he knew that the lions would not be missing in a region\r\nabounding with such numerous herds of antelopes. In fact, it happened\r\nthat very night that some lions began to roar among the gigantic\r\njunipers* [*Junipers in the Karamojo Mountains in Abyssinia attain the\r\nheight of one hundred and sixty feet. See Elisée Reclus.] growing on\r\nthe hillsides. Notwithstanding the blazing fire the lions, allured by\r\nthe odor of horses, drew nearer to the camp; but, when the King became\r\ntired of hearing their voices and suddenly, amid the stillness, his\r\nthreatening, thunder-like clarion tones resounded, they hushed as\r\nthough abashed, apparently understanding that with such an individual\r\nit was best not to have any direct dealings. The children slept\r\nexcellently the balance of the night, and only at daybreak did they\r\nproceed upon their further journey.\r\n\r\nBut for Stas anxiety and worry again began. In the first place, he\r\nperceived that they were traveling slowly and that they could not make\r\nmore than six miles a day. Proceeding in this manner they would be able\r\nindeed to reach the Abyssinian frontier after a month, but as Stas was\r\ndetermined to follow Linde's advice in every respect, and Linde had\r\npositively claimed that they would not be able to go through to\r\nAbyssinia, there remained only the road to the ocean. But according to\r\nthe calculation of the Swiss they were over six hundred and twenty\r\nmiles from the ocean, and that in a direct line; then Mombasa being\r\nsituated farther south, the goal was still further; therefore, the\r\nentire journey would require over three months. With alarm Stas thought\r\nthat it would be three months of excessive heat, toil, and dangers from\r\nnegro tribes which they might encounter. They were still in a desolate\r\ncountry from which the population had been driven by the smallpox and\r\nnews of the dervish raids; but Africa, on the whole, is quite populous,\r\nso sooner or later they must reach localities inhabited by unknown\r\nraces, ruled usually by savage and cruel petty kings. It was an\r\nuncommon task to extricate one's self with life and liberty from such\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nStas relied simply upon this: that if he chanced upon the Wahima\r\npeople, he would drill a few tens of warriors in shooting, and\r\nafterwards induce them by great promises to accompany him to the ocean.\r\nBut Kali had no idea where the Wahimas lived; neither could Linde, who\r\nhad heard something of the tribe, indicate the way to them, nor could\r\nhe designate specifically the locality occupied by them. Linde had\r\nmentioned some great lake, of which he knew only from narratives, and\r\nKali contended with positiveness that one side of that lake, which he\r\ncalled Basso-Narok, was occupied by the Wahimas, and the other by the\r\nSamburus. Now Stas was troubled by this: that in the geography of\r\nAfrica, which in the school in Port Said was taught very thoroughly,\r\nthere was no mention made of such a lake. If Kali only had spoken of\r\nit, he would have assumed that it was Victoria Nyanza, but Linde could\r\nnot err for he had just come from Victoria, northward, along the\r\nKaramojo Mountains, and, from reports of natives of those mountains, he\r\nhad come to the conclusion that this mysterious lake was situated\r\nfurther east and north. Stas did not know what to think of it all; he\r\nfeared, however, that he might not chance upon the Wahimas at the lake;\r\nhe feared also the savage tribes, the waterless jungle, the\r\ninsurmountable mountains, the tsetse flies which destroy animals; he\r\nfeared the sleeping sickness, the fever for Nell, the heat, and that\r\nimmeasurable expanse which still separated them from the ocean.\r\n\r\nBut after leaving Mount Linde, naught else remained to do than to go\r\nahead continually eastward. Linde indeed had said that this journey was\r\nbeyond the strength of an experienced and energetic traveler, but Stas\r\nhad already acquired a great deal of experience, and as to energy, why,\r\nas Nell was concerned, he determined to use as much of it as might be\r\nnecessary. In the meantime it was essential to spare the strength of\r\nthe little girl; so he decided to travel only from six until ten\r\no'clock in the forenoon, and to make the second march from three to six\r\nin the afternoon only in case that at the first stopping place there\r\nwas no water.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, as the rain fell during the massica quite\r\ncopiously, they found water everywhere. The little lakes, formed by the\r\ndownpours in the valleys, were still well filled, and from the\r\nmountains flowed here and there streams, pouring crystalline, cool\r\nwater in which bathing was excellent and at the same time absolutely\r\nsafe, for crocodiles live only in the greater waters in which fish,\r\nwhich form their usual food, are to be found.\r\n\r\nStas, however, did not permit the little girl to drink crude water as\r\nhe had inherited from Linde a filter whose action always filled Kali\r\nand Mea with amazement. Both seeing how the filter, immerged in a\r\nturbid, whitish liquid, admitted to the reservoir only pure and\r\ntranslucent water, lay down with laughter and slapped their knees with\r\nthe palms of their hands in sign of surprise and joy.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the journey at the beginning progressed easily. They had\r\nfrom Linde considerable supplies of coffee, tea, sugar, bouillon,\r\nvarious preserves, and all kinds of medicine. Stas did not have to save\r\nhis packs for there were more of them than they could take along; they\r\ndid not lack also various implements, weapons of all calibers, and\r\nsky-rockets, which on encountering negroes might prove very useful. The\r\ncountry was fertile; game, therefore fresh meat, was everywhere in\r\nabundance, likewise fruit. Here and there in the low lands they chanced\r\nupon marshes, but still covered with water, therefore not infecting the\r\nair with their noxious exhalations. On the table-land there were none\r\nof the mosquitoes which inoculate the blood with fever. The heat from\r\nten o'clock in the morning became unbearable but the little travelers\r\nstopped during the so-called \"white hours\" in the deep shade of great\r\ntrees, through the dense foliage of which not a ray of the sun could\r\npenetrate. Perfect health also favored Nell, Stas, and the negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day Stas rode with Nell on the King, for they had chanced\r\nupon a wide belt of acacias, growing so densely that the horses could\r\nmove only on a path beaten down by the elephant. The hour was early,\r\nthe morning radiant and dewy. The children conversed about the journey\r\nand the fact that each day brought them nearer to the ocean and to\r\ntheir fathers, for whom both continually longed. This, from the moment\r\nof their abduction from Fayûm, was the inexhaustible subject of all\r\ntheir conversations, which always moved them to tears. And they\r\nincessantly repeated in a circle that their papas thought that they\r\nalready were dead and both were grieving and in spite of hope were\r\ndespatching Arabs to Khartûm for news while they were now far away, not\r\nonly from Khartûm but from Fashoda, and after five days would be still\r\nfarther until finally they would reach the ocean, or perhaps before\r\nthat time, some kind of place from which they could send despatches.\r\nThe only person in the whole caravan who knew what still awaited them\r\nwas Stas;--Nell, on the other hand, was most profoundly convinced that\r\nthere was nothing in the world which \"Stes\" could not accomplish and\r\nshe was quite certain that he would conduct her to the coast. So many\r\ntimes, anticipating events, she pictured to herself in her little head\r\nwhat would happen when the first news of them arrived and, chirping\r\nlike a little bird, related it to Stas. \"Our papas are sitting,\" she\r\nsaid, \"in Port Said and weeping, when in comes a boy with a despatch.\r\nWhat is it? My papa or your papa opens it and looks at the signatures\r\nand reads 'Stas and Nell.' Then they will rejoice! Then they will start\r\nup to prepare to meet us! Then there will be joy in the whole house and\r\nour papas will rejoice and everybody will rejoice and they will praise\r\nyou and they will come and I shall hug tightly papa's neck, and after\r\nthat we shall always be--together and--\"\r\n\r\nAnd it ended in this: that her chin commenced to quiver, the beautiful\r\neyes changed into two fountains, and in the end she leaned her head on\r\nStas' arm and wept from sorrow, longing, and joy at the thought of the\r\nfuture meeting. And Stas, allowing his imagination to roam into the\r\nfuture, divined that his father would be proud of him; that he would\r\nsay to him: \"You behaved as became a Pole;\" and intense emotion\r\npossessed him and in his heart was bred a longing, ardor, and courage\r\nas inflexible as steel. \"I must,\" he said to himself, \"rescue Nell. I\r\nmust live to see that moment.\" And at such moments it seemed to him\r\nthat there were no dangers which he was not able to overcome nor\r\nobstacles which he could not surmount.\r\n\r\nBut it was yet far to the final victory. In the meantime they were\r\nmaking their way through the acacia grove. The long thorns of these\r\ntrees even made white marks upon the King's hide. Finally the grove\r\nbecame thinner and across the branches of the scattered trees could be\r\nseen in the distance a green jungle. Stas, notwithstanding that the\r\nheat was very oppressive, slipped out of the palanquin and sat on the\r\nelephant's neck to see whether there were any herds of antelopes or\r\nzebras within view, for he wished to replenish his supply of meat.\r\n\r\nIn fact, on the right side he espied a herd of ariels, composed of a\r\nfew head, and among them two ostriches, but when they passed the last\r\nclump of trees and the elephant turned to the left, a different sight\r\nstruck the eyes of the boy. At the distance of about a third of a mile\r\nhe observed a large manioc field and at the border of the field between\r\nten and twenty black forms apparently engaged at work in the field.\r\n\r\n\"Negroes!\" he exclaimed, turning to Nell.\r\n\r\nAnd his heart began to beat violently. For a while, he hesitated as to\r\nwhether he should turn back and hide again in the acacias, but it\r\noccurred to him that, sooner or later, he would have to meet the\r\nnatives in populated districts and enter into relations with them, and\r\nthat the fate of the whole traveling party might depend upon how those\r\nrelations were formed; so, after brief reflection, he guided the\r\nelephant towards the field.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Kali approached and, pointing his hand at a clump of\r\ntrees, said:\r\n\r\n\"Great master! That is a negro village and there are women working at\r\nthe manioc. Shall I ride to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will ride together,\" Stas answered, \"and then you shall tell them\r\nthat we come as friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what to tell them, master,\" exclaimed the young negro with\r\ngreat self-assurance.\r\n\r\nAnd turning the horses towards the workers, he placed the palms of his\r\nhands around his lips and began to shout:\r\n\r\n\"Yambo, he yambo sana!\"\r\n\r\nAt this sound, the women engaged in hoeing the manioc field started up\r\nsuddenly and stood as if thunderstruck, but this lasted only the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, for afterwards, flinging away in alarm the hoes\r\nand baskets, they began to run away, screaming, to the trees amidst\r\nwhich the village was concealed.\r\n\r\nThe little travelers approached slowly and calmly. In the thicket\r\nresounded the yelling of some hundred voices, after which silence fell.\r\nIt was interrupted finally by the hollow but loud rumble of a drum,\r\nwhich did not cease even for a moment.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently a signal of the warriors for battle, for three hundred\r\nof them suddenly emerged from the thicket. All stood in a long row\r\nbefore the village. Stas stopped the King at the distance of one\r\nhundred paces and began to gaze at them. The sun illuminated their\r\nwell-shaped forms, wide breasts, and powerful arms. They were armed\r\nwith bows and spears. Around their thighs some had short skirts of\r\nheath, and some of monkey skin. Their heads were adorned with ostrich\r\nand parrot feathers, or great scalps torn off baboons' skulls. They\r\nappeared warlike and threatening, but they stood motionless and in\r\nsilence, for their amazement was simply unbounded and subdued the\r\ndesire for fighting. All eyes were fastened upon the King, on the white\r\npalanquin, and the white man sitting on his neck.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, an elephant was not an unknown animal to them. On the\r\ncontrary, they continually live in dread of elephants, whole herds of\r\nwhich destroy at night their manioc fields as well as banana and\r\ndoom-palm plantations. As the spears and arrows do not pierce the\r\nelephant's hide, the poor negroes fight the depredators with the help\r\nof fire, with the aid of cries imitating a cockerel's crow, by digging\r\npits, and constructing traps made of the trunks of trees. But that an\r\nelephant should become slave of man and permit one to sit on his neck\r\nwas something which none of them ever saw before, and it never entered\r\ninto the mind of any of them that anything like that was possible. So\r\nthe spectacle which was presented to them passed so far beyond their\r\nunderstanding and imagination that they did not know what to do:\r\nwhether to fight or to run where their eyes should lead them, though it\r\nwould result in leaving them to the caprice of fate.\r\n\r\nSo in uncertainty, alarm, and amazement they only whispered to each\r\nother:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mother! What creatures are these which have come to us, and what\r\nawaits us at their hands?\"\r\n\r\nBut at this Kali, having ridden within a spear's throw of them, stood\r\nup in the stirrups and began to shout:\r\n\r\n\"People! people! Listen to the voice of Kali, the son of Fumba, the\r\nmighty king of the Wahimas on the shores of Bassa-Narok. Oh listen,\r\nlisten, and if you understand his speech, pay heed to each word that he\r\nutters.\"\r\n\r\n\"We understand,\" rang the answer of three hundred mouths.\r\n\r\n\"Let your king stand forth; let him tell his name and let him open his\r\nears and lips that he may hear better.\"\r\n\r\n\"M'Rua! M'Rua!\" numerous voices began to cry.\r\n\r\nM'Rua stepped in front of the ranks, but not more than three paces. He\r\nwas a negro, already old, tall and powerfully built, but evidently did\r\nnot suffer from too much courage, as the calves of his legs quivered so\r\nthat he had to implant the edge of a spear in the ground and support\r\nhimself on the shaft in order to stand on his legs.\r\n\r\nAfter his example, the other warriors also drove the spears into the\r\nground in sign that they wanted to hear peaceably the words of the\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nAnd Kali again raised his voice.\r\n\r\n\"M'Rua, and you, M'Rua's men, you heard that to you speaks the son of\r\nthe king of the Wahimas, whose cows cover as thickly the mountains\r\naround the Bassa-Narok as the ants cover the body of a slain giraffe.\r\nAnd what says Kali, the son of the king of Wahima? Lo, he announces to\r\nyou the great and happy tidings that there comes to your village the\r\n'Good Mzimu.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter which he yelled still louder:\r\n\r\n\"That is so! The Good Mzimu! Ooo!\"\r\n\r\nIn the stillness which ensued could be perceived the great sensation\r\nwhich Kali's words created. The wave of warriors surged back and forth,\r\nfor some, impelled by curiosity, advanced a few paces, while others\r\nretreated in fear. M'Rua supported himself with both hands on the\r\nspear--and for some time the hollow silence continued. Only after a\r\nwhile a murmur passed through the ranks and individual voices began to\r\nrepeat \"Mzimu! Mzimu!\" and here and there resounded shouts of \"Yancig!\r\nYancig!\" expressive at the same time of homage and welcome.\r\n\r\nBut Kali's voice again predominated over the murmurs and shouts:\r\n\r\n\"Look and rejoice! Lo, the 'Good Mzimu' sits there in that white hut on\r\nthe back of the great elephant and the great elephant obeys her as a\r\nslave obeys a master and like a child its mother! Oh, neither your\r\nfathers nor you have seen anything like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have not seen! Yancig! Yancig!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the eyes of all warriors were directed at the \"hut,\" or rather at\r\nthe palanquin.\r\n\r\nAnd Kali, who during the religious instructions on Mount Linde had\r\nlearned that faith moves mountains, was deeply convinced that the\r\nprayer of the little white \"bibi\" could procure everything from God; so\r\nhe spoke thus further and in perfect sincerity:\r\n\r\n\"Listen! Listen! The 'Good Mzimu' is riding on an elephant in the\r\ndirection in which the sun rises, beyond the mountains out of the\r\nwaters; there the 'Good Mzimu' will tell the Great Spirit to send you\r\nclouds, and those clouds during a drought will water with rain your\r\nmillet, your manioc, your bananas, and the grass in the jungle, in\r\norder that you may have plenty to eat and that your cows shall have\r\ngood fodder and shall give thick and fat milk. Do you want to have\r\nplenty of food and milk--oh, men?\"\r\n\r\n\"He! We do, we do!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the 'Good Mzimu' will tell the Great Spirit to send to you the\r\nwind, which will blow away from your village that sickness which\r\nchanges the body into a honey-comb. Do you want him to blow it\r\naway--oh, men?\"\r\n\r\n\"He! Let him blow it away!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Great Spirit at the prayer of the 'Good Mzimu' will protect\r\nyou from attacks and slavery and from depredations in your fields and\r\nfrom the lion and from the panther and from the snake and from the\r\nlocust--\"\r\n\r\n\"Let her do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, listen yet and look who sits before the hut between the ears of\r\nthe terrible elephant. Lo, there sits bwana kubwa, the great and mighty\r\nwhite master, whom the elephant fears!\"\r\n\r\n\"He!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who has thunder-bolts in his hand and kills with it bad men--\"\r\n\r\n\"He!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who kills lions--\"\r\n\r\n\"He!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who lets loose fiery snakes--\"\r\n\r\n\"He!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who crushes rocks--\"\r\n\r\n\"He!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, however, will do you no harm, if you will honor the 'Good Mzimu.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yancig! Yancig!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if you will bring to him an abundance of dry flour from bananas,\r\neggs of chickens, fresh milk, and honey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yancig! Yancig!\"\r\n\r\n\"So approach and fall on your faces before the 'Good Mzimu!'\"\r\n\r\nM'Rua and his warriors started and, not ceasing to \"yancig\" for a\r\nmoment, advanced between ten and twenty paces, but they approached\r\ncautiously, for a superstitious fear of the \"Mzimu\" and downright\r\nterror before the elephant impeded their steps. The sight of Saba\r\nstartled them anew as they mistook him for a \"wobo,\" that is, a big,\r\nyellowish-brown leopard, which lives in that region as well as in\r\nSouthern Abyssinia, and whom the natives fear more than a lion, for it\r\nprefers human flesh above all other, and with unheard-of daring attacks\r\neven armed men. They quieted, however, seeing that the little obese\r\nnegro held the terrible \"wobo\" on a rope. But they were acquiring a\r\nstill greater idea of the power of the \"Good Mzimu,\" as well as of the\r\nwhite master, and, staring now at the elephant then at Saba, they\r\nwhispered to each other: \"If they bewitched even the 'wobo' who in the\r\nworld can oppose them?\" But the most solemn moment did not come until\r\nStas, turning to Nell, first bowed profoundly and afterwards drew aside\r\nthe curtain-like walls of the palanquin and exhibited to the eyes of\r\nthe crowd the \"Good Mzimu.\" M'Rua and all the warriors fell on their\r\nfaces so that their bodies formed a long, living deck. Not one of them\r\ndared to move, and fear prevailed in all hearts all the more when the\r\nKing, either at Stas' order or of his own volition, raised his trunk\r\nand began to trumpet strongly; and after his example Saba emitted the\r\ndeepest bass of which he was capable. Then from all breasts issued,\r\nresembling entreating groans, \"Aka! Aka! Aka!\" and this continued until\r\nKali again addressed them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, M'Rua, and you, children of M'Rua! You have paid homage to the\r\n'Good Mzimu'; therefore rise, gaze, and fill your eyes, for whoever\r\ndoes that gains the blessing of the Great Spirit. Drive away, also,\r\nfear from your breasts and bellies and know that wherever the 'Good\r\nMzimu' sojourns, human blood cannot be shed.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, and particularly as a result of the announcement that\r\nin the presence of the \"Good Mzimu\" no one can meet death, M'Rua rose,\r\nand after him the other warriors, and began to gaze, bashfully but\r\neagerly at the kind divinity. Indeed, they would have to acknowledge,\r\nif Kali again should ask them about it, that neither their fathers nor\r\nthey ever had beheld anything like it. For their eyes were accustomed\r\nto monstrous figures of idols, made of wood and shaggy cocoanuts, and\r\nnow there appeared before them on an elephant's back a bright divinity,\r\ngentle, sweet, and smiling, resembling a white bird, and at the same\r\ntime a white flower. So, too, their fears passed away, their breasts\r\nbreathed freely; their thick lips began to grin and their hands were\r\ninvoluntarily stretched out towards the charming phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Yancig! Yancig! Yancig!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Stas, who was watching everything with the closest\r\npossible attention, observed that one of the negroes, wearing a pointed\r\ncap of rats' skin, slunk away from the ranks immediately after Kali's\r\nlast words and, crawling like a snake in the grass, turned to an\r\nisolated hut standing apart, beyond the enclosure, but surrounded\r\nlikewise by a high stockade bound by climbing plants.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the \"Good Mzimu,\" though greatly embarrassed by the\r\nrole of a divinity, at Stas' request stretched out her little hand and\r\nbegan to greet the negroes. The black warriors watched with joy in\r\ntheir eyes each movement of that little hand, firmly believing it\r\npossessed powerful \"charms,\" which would protect them and secure them\r\nagainst a multitude of disasters. Some, striking their breasts and\r\nhips, said: \"Oh, mother, now it will be well--for us and our cows.\"\r\nM'Rua, now entirely emboldened, drew near the elephant and prostrated\r\nhimself once more before the \"Good Mzimu\" and after that, bowing to\r\nStas, spoke in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"Would the great master, who leads the white divinity on the elephant,\r\nbe pleased to eat a small piece of M'Rua, and would he consent that\r\nM'Rua should eat a small piece of him, in order that they should become\r\nbrothers, among whom there is no falsehood and treachery?\"\r\n\r\nKali at once translated these words, but perceiving from Stas'\r\ncountenance that he did not have the slightest desire to eat a small\r\npiece of M'Rua, turned to the old negro and said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, M'Rua! Do you really think that the white master, whom the\r\nelephant fears, who holds thunderbolts in his hands, who kills lions,\r\nto whom the 'wobo' wags its tail, who lets loose fiery snakes and\r\ncrushes rocks, could form a blood brotherhood with a mere king?\r\nReflect, oh, M'Rua, whether the Great Spirit would not punish you for\r\nyour audacity, and whether it is not enough of glory for you if you eat\r\na small piece of Kali, the son of Fumba, the ruler of the Wahimas, and\r\nif Kali, the son of Fumba, eats a small piece of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not a slave?\" M'Rua asked.\r\n\r\n\"The great master did not seize Kali, neither did he buy him; he only\r\nsaved his life; therefore Kali is conducting the 'Good Mzimu' and the\r\nmaster to the country of the Wahimas in order that the Wahimas and\r\nFumba should pay honors to them and give them great gifts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it be as you say and let M'Rua eat a small piece of Kali and Kali\r\na small piece of M'Rua.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it be so,\" repeated the warriors.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the fetish-man?\" the king asked.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the fetish-man? Where is the fetish-man? Where is Kamba?\"\r\nnumerous voices began to call.\r\n\r\nThen something occurred which might change entirely the state of\r\naffairs, embroil the friendly relations, and make the negroes enemies\r\nof the newly arrived guests. From the hut standing apart and surrounded\r\nby a separate stockade, there suddenly resounded an infernal din. It\r\nwas like the roar of a lion, like thunder, like the rumbling of a drum,\r\nlike the laughter of a hyena, the howling of a wolf, and like the\r\nshrill creaking of rusty iron hinges. The King hearing these dreadful\r\nsounds, began to trumpet, Saba barked, the donkey, on which Nasibu sat,\r\nbrayed. The warriors leaped as if scalded, and pulled the spears out of\r\nthe ground. Confusion ensued. Stas' ears were assailed by the uneasy\r\nshouts of: \"Our Mzimu! Our Mzimu!\" The esteem and favor, with which\r\nthey looked at the arrivals, vanished in one moment. The eyes of the\r\nsavages began to cast suspicious and hostile glances. Threatening\r\nmurmurs began to rise among the crowd and the horrible noise in the\r\nisolated hut increased more and more.\r\n\r\nKali was terrified and, approaching Stas quickly, said in a voice\r\nbroken with emotion:\r\n\r\n\"Master! the fetish-man has awakened the wicked Mzimu, who fears that\r\nhe will lose gifts and is roaring in a rage. Master, quiet the\r\nfetish-man and the wicked Mzimu with great gifts, for otherwise these\r\nmen will turn against us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet them?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly he was possessed by anger at the perversity and greed of\r\nthe fetish-man; and the unexpected danger roused him to the bottom of\r\nhis soul. His swarthy face assumed the same expression which it had\r\nwhen he shot Gebhr, Chamis, and the Bedouins. His eyes glittered\r\nominously; his lips were compressed and his cheeks paled.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I'll quiet them!\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnd without any reflection he drove the elephant towards the hut.\r\n\r\nKali, not desiring to remain alone among the negroes, ran after him.\r\nFrom the breasts of the savage warriors there came a shout--it was not\r\nknown whether of alarm or of rage, but, before they recovered their\r\nwits, the stockade under the pressure of the elephant's head crashed\r\nand tumbled; after that the clay walls of the hut crumbled and amid\r\ndust the roof flew up in the air; and after a while M'Rua and his men\r\nsaw the black trunk raised high and at the end of the trunk the\r\nfetish-man, Kamba.\r\n\r\nAnd Stas, observing on the floor a big drum made of the hollowed trunk\r\nof a tree with monkey skin stretched over it, ordered Kali to hand it\r\nto him and, returning, stopped directly among the amazed warriors.\r\n\r\n\"Men!\" he said in a loud voice, \"it is not your Mzimu who roars; it is\r\nthis rogue who makes the noise on the drum to wheedle gifts out of you,\r\nand whom you fear like children!\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he seized the rope drawn through the dried-up skin of the\r\ndrum and began to twirl it around with all his strength. The same\r\nsounds which had previously so startled the negroes resounded now, and\r\neven more shrilly, as they were not muffled by the walls of the hut.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how stupid are M'Rua and his children!\" shouted Kali.\r\n\r\nStas gave the drum back to Kali while the latter began to make a noise\r\nwith it with such zeal that for a while a word could not be heard. When\r\nfinally he had enough, he flung the drum at M'Rua's feet.\r\n\r\n\"This is your Mzimu,\" he exclaimed, with great laughter.\r\n\r\nAfter which he began with the usual negro exuberance of words to\r\naddress the warriors; at which he was not at all sparing of jeers at\r\nthem and at M'Rua. He declared to them, pointing at Kamba, that \"that\r\nthief in the cap made of rat's skin\" cheated them through many rainy\r\nand dry seasons and they fed him on beans, flesh of kids, and honey. Is\r\nthere another king and nation as stupid in the world? They believed in\r\nthe power of the old deceiver and in his charms, and look now, how that\r\ngreat fetish-man hangs from the elephant's trunk and is crying \"Aka!\"\r\nto arouse the pity of the white master. Where is his power? Where are\r\nhis charms? Why does not any wicked Mzimu roar in his defense? Ah! What\r\nis this, their Mzimu? A clout of monkey skin and piece of wood hollowed\r\nthrough decay which the elephant will tread to pieces. Among the\r\nWahimas, neither the women nor the children would be afraid of such a\r\nMzimu, and M'Rua and his men fear him. There is only one genuine Mzimu\r\nand one really great and powerful master. Let them pay honors to them;\r\nlet them bring as many gifts as they possibly can, as otherwise\r\ncalamities, of which they hitherto have not heard, will befall them.\r\n\r\nFor the negroes even these words were unnecessary as the fetish-man,\r\ntogether with his wicked Mzimu, appeared so vastly weaker than the new\r\ndivinity and the white master, that it sufficed most fully to make them\r\ndesert him and load him with contempt. So they commenced anew to\r\n\"yancig\" with even greater humility and haste. But as they were angry\r\nat themselves because they had allowed Kamba to cheat them for so many\r\nyears, they wanted, by all means, to kill him. M'Rua himself begged\r\nStas to allow him to bind and keep him until he could devise a\r\nsufficiently cruel death. Nell, however, was determined to spare his\r\nlife, and as Kali had announced that wherever the \"Good Mzimu\" sojourns\r\nhuman blood cannot be shed, Stas consented only to the expulsion of the\r\nhapless fetish-man from the village.\r\n\r\nKamba, who expected that he would die in the most ingeniously devised\r\ntortures, fell on his face before the \"Good Mzimu\" and, blubbering,\r\nthanked her for saving his life. From beyond the stockade women and\r\nchildren poured, for the news of the arrival of the extraordinary\r\nguests had already spread over the whole village, and the desire to see\r\nthe white Mzimu overcame their terror. Stas and Nell for the first time\r\nsaw a settlement of real savages, which even the Arabs had not\r\nsucceeded in reaching. The dress of these negroes consisted only of\r\nheath or skins tied around their hips; all were tattooed. Men as well\r\nas women had perforated ears, and in the opening, chunks of wood or\r\nbone so big that the expanded lobes reached the shoulders. In the lower\r\nlips they carried \"peleles,\" that is, wooden or bony rings as large as\r\nsaucers. The more distinguished warriors and their wives had around\r\ntheir throats collars of iron or brass wire so high and stiff that they\r\ncould barely move their heads.\r\n\r\nThey apparently belonged to the Shilluk tribe, which extends far into\r\nthe east, for Kali and Mea understood their speech excellently and Stas\r\npartly. They did not have, however, limbs as long as their kindred\r\nliving on the overflowing banks of the Nile; they were broader in the\r\nshoulders, not so tall, and generally less like wading birds. The\r\nchildren looked like fleas and, not being yet disfigured by \"peleles,\"\r\nwere, without comparison, better looking than the older people.\r\n\r\nThe women, having first from a distance sated their eyes with looking\r\nat the \"Good Mzimu,\" began to vie with the warriors in bringing gifts\r\nto her, consisting of kids, chickens, eggs, black beans, and beer\r\nbrewed of millet. This continued until Stas stopped the afflux of\r\nsupplies; as he paid for them liberally with beads and colored percale,\r\nand Nell distributed between ten and twenty looking-glasses inherited\r\nfrom Linde, immense joy reigned in the whole village; and around the\r\ntent, in which the little travelers sought shelter, shouts, happy and\r\nfull of enthusiasm, continually resounded. After that, the warriors\r\nperformed a war-dance in honor of the guests and fought a sham battle,\r\nand finally they proceeded to form a blood brotherhood between Kali and\r\nM'Rua.\r\n\r\nOwing to the absence of Kamba, who for this ceremony was usually\r\nindispensable, his place was taken by an old negro sufficiently\r\nconversant with the adjuration. The latter, having killed a kid and\r\nextracted its liver, divided it into fair-sized morsels; after which he\r\nbegan to turn a kind of spinning-wheel with his hand and foot and,\r\ngazing now at Kali and then at M'Rua, addressed them in a solemn voice:\r\n\r\n\"Kali, son of Fumba, do you desire to eat a piece of M'Rua, the son of\r\nM'Kuli, and you, M'Rua, son of M'Kuli, do you desire to eat a piece of\r\nKali, the son of Fumba?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do,\" announced the future brethren.\r\n\r\n\"Do you desire that the heart of Kali should be the heart of M'Rua and\r\nthe heart of M'Rua the heart of Kali?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the hands and the spears and the cows?\"\r\n\r\n\"And the cows!\"\r\n\r\n\"And everything which each one possesses and will possess?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what he possesses and will possess.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that there should not be between you falsehood, nor treachery, nor\r\nhatred?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor hatred!\"\r\n\r\n\"And that one shall not pilfer from the other?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\"\r\n\r\n\"And that you shall be brethren?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\nThe wheel turned more and more rapidly. The warriors, gathered around,\r\nwatched its revolutions with ever-increasing interest.\r\n\r\n\"Ao!\" exclaimed the aged negro, \"if one of you deceives the other by\r\nlies, if he betrays him, if he steals from him, if he poisons him, may\r\nhe be accursed!\"\r\n\r\n\"May he be accursed!\" repeated all the warriors.\r\n\r\n\"And if he is a liar and is plotting treason, let him not swallow the\r\nblood of his brother, and let him spit it out before our eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, before our eyes!\"\r\n\r\n\"And let him die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him be torn to pieces by a wobo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wobo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Or a lion!\"\r\n\r\n\"Or a lion!\"\r\n\r\n\"May he be trampled upon by an elephant and a rhinoceros and a buffalo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--and a buffalo!\" repeated the chorus.\r\n\r\n\"May he be bit by a snake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Snake!\"\r\n\r\n\"And may his tongue become black!\"\r\n\r\n\"Black!\"\r\n\r\n\"And his eyes sink to the back of his head!\"\r\n\r\n\"To the back of his head!\"\r\n\r\n\"And may he walk on his heels upward!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! on his heels upward!\"\r\n\r\nNot only Stas but Kali bit his lips in order not to burst out laughing.\r\nIn the meantime adjurations were repeated, more and more horrible, and\r\nthe wheel kept spinning so quickly that the eyes could not keep pace\r\nwith its whirl. This continued until the old negro entirely lost his\r\nstrength and breath.\r\n\r\nThen he squatted on the ground, and for some time nodded his head in\r\nboth directions in silence. After a while, however, he rose and taking\r\na knife, cut with it the skin at Kali's shoulder and smearing a piece\r\nof kid's liver with his blood, shoved it into M'Rua's mouth; the other\r\npiece smeared in the king's blood he shoved into Kali's mouth. Both\r\nswallowed so quickly that their wind-pipes began to play, and their\r\neyes bulged out; after which they grabbed hold of hands in sign of\r\nloyal and everlasting friendship.\r\n\r\nThe warriors on the other hand began to shout with glee:\r\n\r\n\"Both swallowed; neither spat it out; therefore they are sincere and\r\nthere is no treachery between them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Stas in his soul thanked Kali that he had acted as his proxy at\r\nthis ceremony, for he felt that at the swallowing of \"a piece\" of M'Rua\r\nhe undoubtedly would have given proof of insincerity and treachery.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, however, the little travelers were not threatened on\r\nthe part of the savages with deceit or any unexpected attacks; on the\r\ncontrary they were treated with a hospitality and an esteem almost\r\ngod-like. This esteem increased when Stas, after making an observation\r\non a barometer, a great heritage from Linde, predicted rain, and when\r\nrain fell that very same day quite copiously, as though the massica*\r\n[*The spring rainy season, which had just passed.] desired to shake off\r\nthe rest of its supplies upon the earth, the negroes were convinced\r\nthat this downpour was the gift of the \"Good Mzimu\" and their gratitude\r\nto Nell was unbounded. Stas joked with her about this, saying that\r\nsince she had become a negro divinity he would proceed alone on his\r\nfurther journey and leave her in M'Rua's village, where the negroes\r\nwould erect for her a chapel of ivory, and would bring beans and\r\nbananas to her.\r\n\r\nBut Nell had no uncertainty, and, standing on her little toes,\r\nwhispered in his ear, according to her custom, only four words: \"You\r\nwon't leave me!\" After which she began to leap from joy, saying that\r\nsince the negroes were so kind, the whole journey to the ocean would be\r\neasy and quick. This happened in front of the tent and in the presence\r\nof the crowd, so old M'Rua, seeing a jumping Mzimu, began at once to\r\nleap as high as he could with his crooked shanks in the conviction that\r\nthrough that act he gave proof of his piety. In emulation of their\r\nsuperior \"the ministers\" started to leap, and after them the warriors,\r\nand later the women and children; in a word, the whole village for some\r\ntime was jumping as if all had lost their wits.\r\n\r\nThis example given by the divinity amused Stas so much that he lay down\r\nand roared with laughter. Nevertheless, during the night-time he\r\nrendered to the pious king and his subjects a real and enduring\r\nservice, for when the elephants made depredations upon their banana\r\nfield he drove towards them on the King and shot a few rockets among\r\nthe herd. The panic caused by the \"fiery snakes\" surpassed even his\r\nexpectation. The huge beasts, seized by a frenzy of terror, filled the\r\njungle with a roar and the noise of hoofs, and, escaping blindly,\r\ntumbled down and trampled upon one another. The mighty King chased\r\nafter his flying companions with extraordinary alacrity, not sparing\r\nblows of his trunk and tusks. After such a night one could be certain\r\nthat not an elephant would appear in the banana and doom-palm\r\nplantations belonging to the village of old M'Rua.\r\n\r\nIn the village great joy also reigned, and the negroes passed the whole\r\nnight in dancing and drinking beer of millet and palm wine. Kali\r\nlearned from them, however, many important things; it appeared that\r\nsome of them had heard of some great water lying east and surrounded by\r\nmountains. For Stas this was proof that the lake, of which no mention\r\nwas made in the geography which he had studied, actually existed; also,\r\nthat going in the direction which they had selected, they would finally\r\nencounter the Wahima people. Inferring from the fact that Mea's and\r\nKali's speech differed very little from M'Rua's speech, he came to the\r\nconclusion that the name of \"Wahima\" was in all probability the\r\ndesignation of a locality, and that the peoples living on the shores of\r\n\"Bassa-Narok\" belonged to the great Shilluk tribe, which begins on the\r\nNile and extends, it is not known how far, to the east.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of the whole village escorted afar the \"Good Mzimu\" and\r\ntook leave of her with tears, begging vehemently that she would deign\r\nto come sometime to M'Rua, and to remember his people. Stas for some\r\ntime hesitated whether he should point out to the negroes the ravine in\r\nwhich he had hidden the wares and supplies left by Linde, which owing\r\nto want of porters he could not take with him, but reflecting that the\r\npossession of such treasures might evoke envy and discord among them,\r\nawaken covetousness, and embroil the peace of their lives, he abandoned\r\nthis design, and, instead, shot a big buffalo and left its meat for a\r\nfarewell feast. The sight of such a large amount of \"mama\" also really\r\ndelighted them.\r\n\r\nFor the following three days the caravan again proceeded through a\r\ndesolate country. The days were scorching, but, owing to the high\r\naltitude of the region, the nights were so cold that Stas ordered Mea\r\nto cover Nell with two shaggy coverlets. They now often crossed\r\nmountainous ravines, sometimes barren and rocky, sometimes covered with\r\nvegetation so compact that they could force their way through it only\r\nwith the greatest difficulty. At the brinks of these ravines they saw\r\nbig apes and sometimes lions and panthers. Stas killed one of them at\r\nthe entreaty of Kali, who afterwards dressed himself in its hide in\r\norder that the negroes might at once know that they had to do with a\r\nperson of royal blood.\r\n\r\nBeyond the ravines, on high table-lands, negro villages again began to\r\nappear. Some lay near together, some at the distance of a day or two.\r\nAll were surrounded by high stockades for protection against lions, and\r\nthese were so entwined with creepers that even close at hand they\r\nlooked like clumps of a virgin forest. Only from the smoke rising from\r\nthe middle of the village could one perceive that people dwelt there.\r\nThe caravan was everywhere received more or less as at M'Rua's village;\r\nthat is, at first with alarm and distrust and afterwards with\r\nadmiration, amazement, and esteem. Once only did it happen that the\r\nwhole village, at the sight of the elephant, Saba, the horses, and the\r\nwhite people, ran away to an adjacent forest, so that there was no one\r\nto converse with. Nevertheless, not a spear was aimed against the\r\ntravelers, for negroes, until Mohammedanism fills their souls with\r\ncruelties and hatred against infidels, are rather timid and gentle. So\r\nit most frequently happened that Kali ate a \"piece\" of the local king\r\nand the local king a \"piece\" of Kali, after which the relations were of\r\nthe most friendly character. To the \"Good Mzimu,\" the negroes furnished\r\nevidence of homage and piety in the shape of chickens, eggs, and honey,\r\nextracted from wooden logs suspended from the boughs of great trees\r\nwith the aid of palm ropes. The \"great master,\" the ruler of the\r\nelephant, thunder, and fiery snakes, aroused mainly fear, which soon,\r\nhowever, changed into gratitude when they became convinced that his\r\ngenerosity equaled his might. Where the villages were closer to one\r\nanother the arrival of the extraordinary travelers was announced from\r\none village to the other by the beating of drums, for the negroes give\r\nnotice of everything with the aid of drumming. It happened also that\r\nthe entire populace would come out to meet them, being well disposed in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nIn one village, numbering one thousand heads, the local ruler, who was\r\nfetish-man and king in the same person, consented to show them \"the\r\ngreat fetish,\" which was surrounded by such extraordinary veneration\r\nand fear that the people did not dare to approach the ebony chapel,\r\ncovered with a rhinoceros hide, and make offerings any nearer than\r\nfifty paces. The king stated that this fetish not long before fell from\r\nthe moon, that it was white and had a tail. Stas declared that he\r\nhimself at the command of the \"Good Mzimu\" sent it, and in saying that\r\nhe did not deviate from the truth, for it appeared that the \"great\r\nfetish\" was plainly one of the kites, despatched from Mount Linde. Both\r\nchildren were pleased with the thought that other kites in a suitable\r\nwind might fly still further. They determined to fly others from\r\nheights in the farther course of time. Stas made and sent out one that\r\nvery same night, which convinced the negroes that the \"Good Mzimu\" and\r\nthe white master also came to earth from the moon, and that they were\r\ndivinities who could not be served with sufficient humility.\r\n\r\nBut more delightful to Stas than these marks of humility and homage was\r\nthe news that Bassa-Narok lay only about thirteen days' distance and\r\nthat the denizens of the village in which they stopped at times\r\nreceived from that direction salt in exchange for doom-palm wine. The\r\nlocal king had even heard of Fumba, as the ruler of the people called\r\n\"Doko.\" Kali confirmed this by saying that more distant neighbors so\r\ncalled the Wahimas and Samburus. Less consoling was the news that on\r\nthe shores of the great water a war was raging, and to go to\r\nBassa-Narok it was necessary to cross immense, wild mountains and steep\r\nravines, full of rapacious beasts. But Stas now did not much heed\r\nrapacious beasts, and he preferred mountains, though the wildest, to\r\nthe low plain country where fever lay in wait for travelers.\r\n\r\nIn high spirits they started. Beyond that populous village they came to\r\nonly one settlement, very wretched and hanging like a nest on the edge\r\nof a chasm. After that the foot-hills began, cut rarely by deep\r\nfissures. On the east rose a hazy chain of peaks, which from a distance\r\nappeared entirely black. This was an unknown region to which they were\r\nbound, not knowing what might befall them before they reached Fumba's\r\ndomains. In the highlands which they passed trees were not lacking, but\r\nwith the exception of dragon-trees and acacias standing alone they\r\nstood in clusters, forming small groves. The travelers stopped amid\r\nthese clumps for refreshment and rest as well as for the abundant shade.\r\n\r\nAmid the trees birds swarmed. Various kinds of pigeons, big birds with\r\nbeaks, which Stas called toucans, starlings, turtle-doves, and\r\ncountless beautiful \"bingales\" flitted in the foliage or flew from one\r\nclump to another, singly and in flocks, changing color like the\r\nrainbow. Some trees appeared from a distance to be covered with\r\nmany-colored flowers. Nell was particularly charmed by the sight of\r\nparadisaical fly-catchers and rather large, black birds, with a crimson\r\nlining to the wings, which emitted sounds like a pastoral fife.\r\nCharming woodpeckers, rosy on top and bright blue beneath, sped in the\r\nsun's luster, catching in their flight bees and grasshoppers. On the\r\ntreetops resounded the screams of the green parrot, and at times there\r\nreached them sounds as though of silvery bells, with which the small\r\ngreen-gray birds hidden under Adansonia leaves greeted one another.\r\n\r\nBefore sunrise and after sunset flocks of native sparrows flew by, so\r\ncountless that were it not for their twitter and the rustle of their\r\nlittle wings they would be mistaken for clouds. Stas assumed that it\r\nwas their pretty little bills which rang so, while in daytime they were\r\nscattered on single clumps.\r\n\r\nBut other birds flying in little flocks, which gave real concerts,\r\nfilled both children with the greatest surprise and ecstasy. Every\r\nlittle flock consisted of five or six females and one male, with\r\nglittering metallic feathers. They sat on a single acacia in this\r\nparticular manner: the male was perched on the top of the tree and the\r\nothers lower, and after the first notes, which seemed like the tuning\r\nof their little throats, the male began a song and the others listened\r\nin silence. Only when he had finished did they repeat together in a\r\nchorus the last refrain of his song. After a brief pause, he resumed\r\nand finished, and they again repeated; after this the whole flock flew\r\nin a light wavy flight to the nearest acacia and the concert, composed\r\nof the soloist and chorus, again resounded in the southern stillness.\r\nThe children could not listen enough to this. Nell, catching the\r\nleading tune of the concert, joined with the chorus and warbled in her\r\nthin little voice the notes resembling the quickly repeated sound of\r\n\"tui, tui, tui, twiling-ting! ting!\"\r\n\r\nOnce the children, following the winged musicians from tree to tree,\r\nwent away over half a mile from the camp, leaving in it the three\r\nnegroes, the King, and Saba. Stas was about to start on a hunting trip\r\nand did not want to take Saba with him, for fear that his barking might\r\nscare away the game. When the little flock finally flew to the last\r\nacacia on the other side of a wide ravine, the boy stopped Nell and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Now I will escort you to the King and after that I shall see whether\r\nthere are any antelopes or zebras in the high jungle, for Kali says\r\nthat the smoked meats will not last longer than two days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I am big now,\" answered Nell, who was always anxious to make it\r\nappear that she was not a little child, \"so I will return alone. We can\r\nsee the camp perfectly from here, and the smoke also.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that you may stray.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't stray. In a high jungle we might stray, but here, see how low\r\nthe grass is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, something may happen to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You yourself said that lions and panthers do not hunt in the daytime.\r\nBesides, you hear how the King is trumpeting from longing after us.\r\nWhat lion would dare to hunt there where the sound of the King reaches?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she began to importune:\r\n\r\n\"Stas, dear, I will go alone, like a grown-up.\"\r\n\r\nStas hesitated for a while but finally assented. The camp and smoke\r\nreally could be seen. The King, who longed for Nell, trumpeted every\r\nlittle while. In the low grass there was no danger of going astray, and\r\nas to lions, panthers, and hyenas, there plainly could be no talk of\r\nthem as these animals seek prey during the night. The boy after all\r\nknew that nothing would afford the little maid greater pleasure than if\r\nhe acted as though he did not regard her as a little child.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"go alone, but go directly, and do not tarry on\r\nthe way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And may I pluck just those flowers?\" she asked, pointing at a cusso\r\nbush, covered with an immense number of rosy flowers.\r\n\r\n\"You may.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he turned her about, pointed out to her once more for\r\ngreater certainty the clump of trees from which the smoke of the camp\r\nissued and from which resounded the King's trumpeting, after which he\r\nplunged into the high jungle growing on the brink of the ravine.\r\n\r\nBut he had not gone a hundred paces when he was seized by uneasiness.\r\n\"Why, it was stupid on my part,\" he thought, \"to permit Nell to walk\r\nalone in Africa. Stupid, stupid. She is such a child! I ought not to\r\nleave her for a step unless the King is with her. Who knows what may\r\nhappen! Who knows whether under that rosy bush some kind of snake is\r\nnot lying! Big apes can leap out of the ravine and carry her away from\r\nme or bite her. God forbid! I committed a terrible folly.\"\r\n\r\nAnd his uneasiness changed into anger at himself, and at the same time\r\ninto a terrible fear. Not reflecting any longer, he turned around as if\r\nstung by a sudden evil presentiment. Walking hurriedly, he held the\r\nrifle ready to fire, with that great dexterity which he had acquired\r\nthrough daily hunting, and advanced amid the thorny mimosas without any\r\nrustle, exactly like a panther when stealing to a herd of antelopes at\r\nnight. After a while he shoved his head out of the high underwood,\r\nglanced about and was stupefied.\r\n\r\nNell stood under a cusso bush with her little hand outstretched; the\r\nrosy flowers, which she had dropped in terror, lay at her feet, and\r\nfrom the distance of about twenty paces a big tawny-gray beast was\r\ncreeping towards her amid the low grass.\r\n\r\nStas distinctly saw his green eyes fastened upon the little maid's\r\nface, which was as white as chalk, his narrow head with flattened ears,\r\nhis shoulder-blades raised upward on account of his lurking and\r\ncreeping posture, his long body and yet longer tail, the end of which\r\nhe moved with a light, cat-like motion. One moment more one spring and\r\nit would be all over with Nell.\r\n\r\nAt this sight the boy, hardened and inured to danger, in the twinkling\r\nof an eye understood that if he did not regain self-command, if he did\r\nnot muster courage, if he shot badly and only wounded the assailant,\r\neven though heavily, the little maid must perish. But he could master\r\nhimself to that degree that under the influence of these thoughts his\r\nhands and limbs suddenly became calm like steel springs. With one\r\nglance of the eye he detected a dark spot in the neighborhood of the\r\nbeast's ear,--with one light motion he directed the barrel of the rifle\r\nat it and fired.\r\n\r\nThe report of the shot, Nell's scream, and a short, shrill bleat\r\nresounded at the same moment. Stas jumped towards Nell, and covering\r\nher with his own body, he aimed again at the assailant.\r\n\r\nBut the second shot was entirely unnecessary, for the dreadful cat lay\r\nlike a rag, flattened out, with nose close to the ground and claws\r\nwedged in the grass--almost without a quiver. The bursting bullet had\r\ntorn out the back of its head and the nape of its neck. Above its eyes,\r\ngory, torn, white convolutions of its brain oozed out.\r\n\r\nAnd the little hunter and Nell stood for some time, gazing now at the\r\nslain beast, then at each other, not being able to utter a word. But\r\nafter that something strange happened. Now this same Stas, who a moment\r\nbefore would have astonished the most experienced hunter in the whole\r\nworld by his calmness and coolness, suddenly became pale; his limbs\r\nbegan to tremble, tears flowed from his eyes, and afterwards he seized\r\nhis head with the palms of his hands and began to repeat:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Nell! Nell! If I had not returned!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was swayed by such consternation, such belated despair, that\r\nevery fiber within him quivered as if he had a fever. After an\r\nunheard-of exertion of his will and all the powers of his soul and body\r\na moment of weakness and relaxation had come. Before his eyes was the\r\npicture of the dreadful beast, resting with blood-stained muzzle in\r\nsome dark cave and tearing Nell's body to pieces. And of course, this\r\ncould have happened and would have happened if he had not returned. One\r\nminute, one second more and it would have been too late. This thought\r\nhe plainly could not banish.\r\n\r\nFinally it ended in this, that Nell, recovering from her fear and\r\nalarm, had to comfort him. The little upright soul threw both her\r\nlittle arms around his neck and, weeping also, began to call to him\r\nloudly, as if she wanted to arouse him from slumber.\r\n\r\n\"Stas! Stas! Nothing is the matter with me. See, nothing is the matter\r\nwith me. Stas! Stas!\"\r\n\r\nBut he came to himself and grew calm only after a long time.\r\nImmediately after that Kali, who heard the shot not far from the camp\r\nand knew that the \"Bwana kubwa\" never fired in vain, came leading a\r\nhorse to carry away the game. The young negro, glancing at the slain\r\nbeast, suddenly retreated, and his face at once became ashen.\r\n\r\n\"Wobo!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe children now approached the carcass, already growing rigid. Up to\r\nthat time Stas did not have an accurate idea as to what kind of beast\r\nof prey had fallen from his shot. At the first glance of the eye it\r\nseemed to the boy that it was an exceptionally large serval;\r\nnevertheless, after closer examination he saw that it was not, for the\r\nslain beast exceeded the dimensions of even a leopard. His tawny skin\r\nwas strewn with chestnut-hued spots, but his head was narrower than\r\nthat of a leopard, which made him resemble somewhat a wolf; his legs\r\nwere higher, paws wider, and his eyes were enormous. One of them was\r\ndriven to the surface by a bullet, the other still stared at the\r\nchildren, fathomless, motionless, and awful. Stas came to the\r\nconclusion that this was a species of panther unknown to zoölogy, just\r\nas Lake Bassa-Narok was unknown to geography.\r\n\r\nKali gazed continually with great terror at the beast stretched upon\r\nthe ground, repeating in a low voice, as if he feared to awaken it:\r\n\r\n\"Wobo! The great master killed a wobo!\"\r\n\r\nBut Stas turned to the little maid, placed his hand on her head, as\r\nthough he desired definitely to assure himself that the wobo had not\r\ncarried her away, and then said:\r\n\r\n\"You see, Nell. You see that even if you are full-grown, you cannot\r\nwalk alone through the jungle.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Stas,\" answered Nell with a penitent mien, \"but I can go with\r\nyou or the King.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me how it was? Did you hear him draw near?\"\r\n\r\n\"No-- Only a golden fly flew out of those flowers. So I turned around\r\nafter it and saw how he crept out of the ravine.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He stood still and began to look at me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he look long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Long, Stas. Only when I dropped the flowers and guarded myself from\r\nhim with my hands did he creep towards me.\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Stas that if Nell were a negress she would have been\r\npounced upon at once, and that in part she owed her preservation to the\r\nastonishment of the beast, which seeing before it for the first time a\r\nbeing unknown to it, for a while was uncertain what to do.\r\n\r\nA chill passed through the boy's bones.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God! Thank God that I returned!\"\r\n\r\nAfter which he asked further:\r\n\r\n\"What were you thinking of at that moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to call you, and--I could not--but--\"\r\n\r\n\"But what?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought that you would protect me--I myself do not know--\"\r\n\r\nSaying this she again threw her little arms around his neck, and he\r\nbegan to stroke her tufts of hair.\r\n\r\n\"You are not afraid, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"My little Mzimu! My Mzimu! You see what Africa is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you will kill every ugly beast?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\nBoth again began to examine closely the rapacious beast. Stas, desiring\r\nto preserve its skin as a trophy ordered Kali to strip it off, but the\r\nlatter from fear that another wobo might creep out of the ravine begged\r\nhim not to leave him alone, and to the question whether he feared a\r\nwobo more than a lion, said:\r\n\r\n\"A lion roars at night and does not leap over stockades, but a wobo in\r\nthe white day can leap over a stockade and kill a great many negroes in\r\nthe middle of the village, and after that he seizes one of them and\r\neats him. Against a wobo a spear is no protection, nor a bow, only\r\ncharms, for a wobo cannot be killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said Stas, \"look at this one; is he not well slain?\"\r\n\r\n\"The white master kills wobo; the black man cannot kill him,\" Kali\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nIt ended in this, that the gigantic cat was tied by a rope to the horse\r\nand the horse dragged him to the camp. Stas, however, did not succeed\r\nin preserving his hide, for the King, who evidently surmised that the\r\nwobo wanted to carry off his little lady, fell into such a frenzy of\r\nrage that even Stas' orders were unable to restrain him. Seizing the\r\nslain beast with his trunk he tossed it twice into the air; after which\r\nhe began to strike it against a tree and in the end trampled upon it\r\nwith his legs and changed it into a shapeless, jelly-like mass. Stas\r\nsucceeded in saving the jaws, which with the remnants of the head he\r\nplaced on an ant-column on the road, and the ants cleaned the bones in\r\nthe course of an hour so thoroughly that not an atom of flesh or blood\r\nremained.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nFour days later Stas stopped for a longer rest on a hill somewhat\r\nsimilar to Mount Linde, but smaller and narrower. That same night Saba\r\nafter a hard battle killed a big male baboon, whom he attacked at a\r\ntime when the baboon was playing with the remnants of a kite, the\r\nsecond in order of those which they had sent before starting for the\r\nocean. Stas and Nell, taking advantage of the stay, determined to glue\r\nnew ones continually, but to fly them only when the monsoon blew from\r\nthe west to the east. Stas placed great reliance upon this, that even\r\nif but one of them should fall into European or Arabian hands it would\r\nundoubtedly attract extraordinary attention and would cause an\r\nexpedition to be despatched expressly for their rescue. For greater\r\ncertainty, besides English and French inscriptions he added Arabian,\r\nwhich was not difficult for him, as he knew the Arabian language\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\nSoon after starting from the resting-place, Kali announced that in the\r\nmountain chain, which he saw in the east, he recognized some of the\r\npeaks which surrounded Bassa-Narok; nevertheless, he was not always\r\ncertain, as the mountains assumed different shapes, according to the\r\nplace from which they were viewed. After crossing a small valley\r\novergrown with cusso bushes and looking like a lake of roses, they\r\nchanced upon a hut of lone hunters. There were two negroes in it and\r\none of them was sick, having been bitten by a thread-like worm.* [*\r\nFilandria medineusis, a worm as thin as thread, and a yard long. Its\r\nbite sometimes causes gangrene.] But both were so savage and stupid and\r\nin addition so terrified by the arrival of the unexpected guests, so\r\ncertain that they would be murdered, that at first it was impossible to\r\nascertain anything from them. But a few slices of smoked meat\r\nunloosened the tongue of the one who was not only sick, but famished,\r\nas his companion doled out food to him very stingily. From him,\r\ntherefore, they learned that about a day's journey away there lay\r\nstraggling villages, governed by petty kings, who were independent of\r\none another; and afterwards, beyond a steep mountain, the domain of\r\nFumba began, extending on the west and south of the great water. When\r\nStas heard this, a great load fell off his heart and new courage\r\nentered his soul. At any rate, they now were almost on the threshold of\r\nthe land of the Wahimas.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to foresee how their further journey would progress;\r\nnevertheless, the boy in any event could expect that it would not be\r\nharder or even longer than that terrible journey from the banks of the\r\nNile which they had undergone, thanks to his exceptional\r\nresourcefulness, and during which he had saved Nell from destruction.\r\nHe did not doubt that, thanks to Kali, the Wahimas would receive them\r\nwith the greatest hospitality and would give every assistance to them.\r\nAfter all, he already well understood the negroes, knew how to act\r\ntowards them, and was almost certain that, even without Kali, he would\r\nhave been able somehow to take care of himself among them.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" he said to Nell, \"that we have passed more than one-half\r\nof the way from Fashoda, and that during the journey which is still\r\nbefore us we may meet very savage negroes, but now will not encounter\r\nany dervishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer negroes,\" the little maid replied.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, while you pass as a goddess. I was kidnapped from Fayûm with a\r\nlittle lady whose name was Nell, and now am conducting some kind of\r\nMzimu. I shall tell my father and Mr. Rawlinson that they never should\r\ncall you anything else.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes began to sparkle and smile:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we may see our papas in Mombasa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps. If it were not for that war on the shores of Bassa-Narok, we\r\nwould be there sooner. Too bad that Fumba should be engaged in one at\r\nthis time!\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he nodded at Kali.\r\n\r\n\"Kali, did the sick negro hear of the war?\"\r\n\r\n\"He heard. It is a big war, very big--Fumba with Samburus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what will happen? How shall we get through the Samburu country?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Samburus will run away before the great master, before the King\r\nand before Kali.\"\r\n\r\n\"And before you?\"\r\n\r\n\"And before Kali, because Kali has a rifle which thunders and kills.\"\r\n\r\nStas began to meditate upon the part which would devolve upon him in\r\nthe conflict between the Wahima and Samburu tribes and determined to\r\nconduct his affairs in such a manner as not to retard his journey. He\r\nunderstood that their arrival would be an entirely unexpected event\r\nwhich would at once assure Fumba of a superiority. Accordingly it was\r\nnecessary only to make the most of a victory.\r\n\r\nIn the villages, of which the sick hunter spoke, they derived new\r\ninformation about the war. The reports were more and more accurate, but\r\nunfavorable for Fumba. The little travelers learned that he was\r\nconducting a defensive campaign, and that the Samburus under the\r\ncommand of their king, named Mamba, occupied a considerable expanse of\r\nthe Wahima country and had captured a multitude of cows. The villagers\r\nsaid that the war was raging principally on the southern border of the\r\ngreat water where on a wide and high rock King Fumba's great \"boma\"* [*\r\nThe same as a zareba in the Sudân. A great boma may also be a sort of\r\nfortress or fortified camp.] was situated.\r\n\r\nThis intelligence greatly grieved Kali, who begged Stas to cross the\r\nmountain separating them from the seat of the war as quickly as\r\npossible, assuring him, at the same time, that he would be able to find\r\nthe road on which he could lead not only the horses but the King. He\r\nwas already in a region which he knew well and now distinguished with\r\ngreat certainty peaks which were familiar to him from childhood.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the passage was not easy, and if it were not for the aid\r\nof the inhabitants of the last village, won by gifts, it would have\r\nbeen necessary to seek another road for the King. These negroes knew\r\nbetter than Kali the passes leading from that side of the mountain, and\r\nafter two days' arduous travel, during which great cold incommoded them\r\nduring the nights, they successfully led the caravan to a depression in\r\na crest of a mountain and from the mountain to a valley lying in the\r\nWahima country.\r\n\r\nStas halted in the morning for a rest in this desolate valley,\r\nsurrounded by underwood, while Kali, who begged to be allowed to scout\r\non horseback in the direction of his father's \"boma,\" which was about a\r\nday's distance, started that very night. Stas and Nell waited for him\r\nthe whole day with the greatest uneasiness and feared that he had\r\nperished or fallen into the hands of the enemy, and when finally he\r\nappeared on a lean and panting horse, he himself was equally fatigued\r\nand so dejected that the sight of him excited pity.\r\n\r\nHe fell at once at Stas' feet and began to implore for help.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, great master,\" he said, \"the Samburus have defeated Fumba's\r\nwarriors; they killed a multitude of them and dispersed those they did\r\nnot kill. They besiege Fumba in a boma on Boko Mountain. Fumba and his\r\nwarriors have nothing to eat in the boma and will perish if the great\r\nmaster does not kill Mamba and all the Samburus with Mamba.\"\r\n\r\nBegging thus, he embraced Stas' knees, while the latter knitted his\r\nbrow and meditated deeply as to what was to be done, for in everything\r\nhe was particularly concerned about Nell.\r\n\r\n\"Where,\" he finally asked, \"are Fumba's warriors whom the Samburus\r\ndispersed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali found them and they will be here at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many are there?\"\r\n\r\nThe young negro moved the fingers of both hands and the toes of both\r\nhis feet about a score of times, but it was evident that he could not\r\nindicate the exact number for the simple reason that he could not count\r\nabove ten and every greater amount appeared to him as \"wengi,\" that is,\r\na multitude.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if they come here, place yourself at their head and go to your\r\nfather's relief.\"\r\n\r\n\"They fear the Samburus and will not go with Kali, but with the great\r\nmaster they will go and kill 'wengi, wengi' of Samburu.\"\r\n\r\nStas pondered again.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he finally said, \"I can neither take the 'bibi' to a battle nor\r\nleave her alone, and I will not do it for anything in the world.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Kali rose and folding his hands began to repeat incessantly:\r\n\r\n\"Luela! Luela! Luela!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is 'Luela'?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"A great boma for Wahima and Samburu women,\" the young negro replied.\r\n\r\nAnd he began to relate extraordinary things. Now Fumba and Mamba had\r\nbeen engaged in continual warfare with each other for a great many\r\nyears. They laid waste to the plantations of each other and carried\r\naway cattle. But there was a locality on the southern shore of the\r\nlake, called Luela, at which even during the fiercest war the women of\r\nboth nations assembled in the market-place with perfect safety. It was\r\na sacred place. The war raged only between men; no defeats or victories\r\naffected the fate of the women, who in Luela, behind a clay enclosure\r\nsurrounding a spacious market-place, found an absolutely safe asylum.\r\nMany of them sought shelter there during the time of hostilities, with\r\ntheir children and goods. Others came from even distant villages with\r\nsmoked meat, beans, millet, manioc, and various other supplies. The\r\nwarriors were not allowed to fight a battle within a distance of Luela\r\nwhich could be reached by the crowing of a rooster. They were likewise\r\nnot permitted to cross the clay rampart with which the market-place was\r\nsurrounded. They could only stand before the rampart and then the women\r\nwould give them supplies of food attached to long bamboo poles. This\r\nwas a very ancient custom and it never happened that either side\r\nviolated it. The victors also were always concerned that the way of the\r\ndefeated to Luela should be cut off and they did not permit them to\r\napproach the sacred place within a distance which could be reached by a\r\nrooster's crow.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, great master!\" Kali begged, again embracing Stas' knees, \"great\r\nmaster, lead 'the bibi' to Luela, and you yourself take the King, take\r\nKali, take the rifle, take fiery snakes and rout the wicked Samburus.\"\r\n\r\nStas believed the young negro's narrative, for he had heard that in\r\nmany localities in Africa war does not include women. He remembered how\r\nat one time in Port Said a certain young German missionary related that\r\nin the vicinity of the gigantic mountain, Kilima-Njaro, the immensely\r\nwarlike Massai tribe sacredly observed this custom, by virtue of which\r\nthe women of the contending parties walked with perfect freedom in\r\ncertain market-places and were never subject to attack. The existence\r\nof this custom on the shores of Bassa-Narok greatly delighted Stas, for\r\nhe could be certain that no danger threatened Nell on account of the\r\nwar. He determined also to start with the little maid without delay for\r\nLuela, all the more because before the termination of the war they\r\ncould not think of a further journey for which not only the aid of the\r\nWahimas but that of the Samburus was necessary.\r\n\r\nAccustomed to quick decisions, he already knew how he should act. To\r\nfree Fumba, to rout the Samburus but not to permit a too bloody\r\nrevenge, and afterwards to command peace and reconcile the\r\nbelligerents, appeared to him an imperative matter not only for himself\r\nbut also most beneficial for the negroes. \"Thus it should be and thus\r\nit shall be!\" he said to himself in his soul, and in the meantime,\r\ndesiring to comfort the young negro for whom he felt sorry, he\r\nannounced that he did not refuse aid.\r\n\r\n\"How far is Luela from here?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"A half day's journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, then! we will convey the 'bibi' there at once, after which I\r\nshall ride on the King and drive away the Samburus from your father's\r\nboma. You shall ride with me and shall fight with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali will kill them with the rifle!\"\r\n\r\nAnd passing at once from despair to joy, he began to leap, laugh, and\r\nthank Stas with as much ardor as though the victory was already\r\nachieved. But further outbursts of gratitude and mirth were interrupted\r\nby the arrival of the warriors, whom he had gathered together during\r\nhis scouting expedition and whom he commanded to appear before the\r\nwhite master. They numbered about three hundred; they were armed with\r\nshields of hippopotamus leather, with javelins and knives. Their heads\r\nwere dressed with feathers, baboon manes, and ferns. At the sight of an\r\nelephant in the service of a man, at the sight of the white faces,\r\nSaba, and the horses, they were seized by the same fear and the same\r\namazement which had possessed the negroes in those villages through\r\nwhich the children previously passed. But Kali warned them in advance\r\nthat they would behold the \"Good Mzimu\" and the mighty master \"who\r\nkills lions, who killed a wobo, whom the elephant fears, who crushes\r\nrocks, lets loose fiery snakes,\" etc. So, instead of running away, they\r\nstood in a long row in silence, full of admiration, with the whites of\r\ntheir eyes glistening, uncertain whether they should kneel or fall on\r\ntheir faces. But at the same time they were full of faith that if these\r\nextraordinary beings would help them then the victories of the Samburus\r\nwould soon end. Stas rode along the file on the elephant, just like a\r\ncommander who is reviewing his army, after which he ordered Kali to\r\nrepeat his promise that he would liberate Fumba, and issued an order\r\nthat they should start for Luela.\r\n\r\nKali rode with a few warriors in advance to announce to the women of\r\nboth tribes that they would have the inexpressible and unheard-of\r\npleasure of seeing the \"Good Mzimu,\" who would arrive on an elephant.\r\nThe matter was so extraordinary that even those women who, being\r\nmembers of the Wahima tribe, recognized Kali as the lost heir to the\r\nthrone, thought that he was jesting with them and were surprised that\r\nhe wanted to jest at a time that was so heavy for the whole tribe and\r\nFumba. When, however, after the lapse of a few hours they saw a\r\ngigantic elephant approaching the ramparts and on it a white palanquin,\r\nthey fell into a frenzy of joy and received the \"Good Mzimu,\" with such\r\nshouts and such yells that Stas at first mistook their voices for an\r\noutburst of hatred, and the more so as the unheard-of ugliness of the\r\nnegresses made them look like witches.\r\n\r\nBut these were manifestations of extraordinary honor. When Nell's tent\r\nwas set in a corner of the market-place under the shade of two thick\r\ntrees, the Wahima and Samburu women decorated it with garlands and\r\nwreaths of flowers, after which they brought supplies of food that\r\nwould have sufficed a month, not only for the divinity herself but for\r\nher retinue. The enraptured women even prostrated themselves before\r\nMea, who, attired in rosy percale and a few strings of blue beads, as a\r\nhumble servant of the Mzimu, appeared to them as a being far superior\r\nto the common negresses.\r\n\r\nNasibu, out of regard for his childish age, was admitted behind the\r\nrampart and at once took advantage of the gifts brought for Nell so\r\nconscientiously that after an hour his little abdomen resembled an\r\nAfrican war drum.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nStas, after a brief rest under the ramparts of Luela, started with Kali\r\nbefore sunset at the head of three hundred warriors for Fumba's boma,\r\nfor he wanted to attack the Samburus during the night, relying upon the\r\nfact that in the darkness the fiery snakes would create a greater\r\nsensation. The march from Luela to Mount Boko, on which Fumba was\r\ndefending himself, counting the rests, required nine hours, so that\r\nthey appeared before the fortress at about three o'clock in the\r\nmorning. Stas halted the warriors and, having ordered them to preserve\r\nthe deepest silence, began to survey the situation. The summit of the\r\nmountain on which the defenders had sought refuge was dark; on the\r\nother hand the Samburus burnt a multitude of camp-fires. Their glare\r\nilluminated the steep walls of the rock and the gigantic trees growing\r\nat its foot. From a distance came the hollow sounds of drums and the\r\nshouts and songs of warriors who evidently were not sparing in their\r\nindulgence of pombe,* [* A beer of millet with which the negroes\r\nintoxicate themselves.] desiring already to celebrate a near and\r\ndecisive victory. Stas advanced at the head of his division still\r\nfarther, so that finally not more than a hundred paces separated him\r\nfrom the last camp-fires. There were no signs of camp sentinels and the\r\nmoonless night did not permit the savages to catch sight of the King\r\nwho, besides, was screened by the underwood. Stas, sitting on his neck,\r\nquietly issued the final orders, after which he gave Kali the signal to\r\nlight one of the sky-rockets. A red ribbon flew up, hissing, high in\r\nthe dark sky, after which, with an explosive sound, it scattered into a\r\nbouquet of red, blue, and golden stars. All voices became hushed and a\r\nmoment of gloomy silence ensued. A few seconds later two more fiery\r\nsnakes flew out, as though with an infernal hiss, but this time they\r\nwere aimed horizontally directly at the Samburu camp; simultaneously\r\nresounded the King's roar and the loud cries of the three hundred\r\nWahimas who, armed with assagais,* [* Negro spears.] maces, and knives,\r\nrushed ahead with irrepressible speed. A battle began, which was the\r\nmore terrible because it took place in the darkness, as all the\r\ncamp-fires in the confusion were at once trampled out. But, at the very\r\nbeginning, blind terror at the sight of the fiery snakes seized the\r\nSamburus. What was happening passed entirely beyond their\r\nunderstanding. They only knew that they were attacked by some terrible\r\nbeings and that horrible and unavoidable destruction threatened them. A\r\ngreater part of them ran away before they could be reached by the\r\nspears and maces of the Wahimas. A hundred and a few tens of warriors,\r\nwhom Mamba succeeded in rallying about him, offered stubborn\r\nresistance; when, however, in the flashes of the shots, they saw a\r\ngigantic beast and on him a person dressed in white, and when their\r\nears were dinned with the reports of the weapon which Kali from time to\r\ntime discharged, their hearts sank. Fumba on the mountain, seeing the\r\nfirst sky-rocket, which burst in the heights, fell on the ground from\r\nfright and lay as though dead for a few minutes. But, regaining\r\nconsciousness, he imagined from the desperate yells of the warriors one\r\nthing, namely, that some kind of spirits were exterminating the\r\nSamburus below. Then the thought flashed through his mind that if he\r\ndid not come to the aid of those spirits, he might incur their wrath,\r\nand as the extermination of the Samburus was his salvation, he mustered\r\nall his warriors about him and sallied forth from a secret side exit of\r\nthe boma and cut off the road of a greater part of the fugitives. The\r\nbattle now changed into a massacre. The Samburu drums ceased to beat.\r\nIn the darkness, which was rent only by the red flashes cast by Kali's\r\nrifle, resounded the howls of the men being killed, the hollow blows of\r\nthe maces against shields and the groans of the wounded. Nobody begged\r\nfor mercy, for mercy is unknown to negroes. Kali, from a fear that in\r\nthe darkness and confusion he might wound his own people, finally\r\nceased to fire, and seizing Gebhr's sword rushed with it into the midst\r\nof the enemies. The Samburus could now flee from the mountains towards\r\ntheir frontiers only by way of one wide pass, but as Fumba blocked this\r\npass with his warriors, out of the whole host only those were safe who,\r\nthrowing themselves upon the ground, permitted themselves to be taken\r\nalive, though they knew that a cruel slavery awaited them, or even\r\nimmediate death at the hands of the victors. Mamba defended himself\r\nheroically until a blow of a mace crushed his skull. His son, young\r\nFaru, fell into Fumba's hand, who ordered him bound, as a future\r\nsacrifice of gratitude to the spirits which had come to his assistance.\r\n\r\nStas did not drive the terrible King into the battle; he permitted him\r\nonly to trumpet to increase the terror of the enemies. He himself did\r\nnot fire a single shot from his rifle at the Samburus, for in the first\r\nplace he had promised little Nell on leaving Luela that he would not\r\nkill any one, and again he actually had no desire to kill people who\r\nhad done no harm to him or Nell. It was enough that he assured the\r\nWahimas a victory and freed Fumba, who was besieged in a great boma.\r\nSoon, also, when Kali came running with news of a definite victory, he\r\nissued an order for the cessation of the battle, which raged yet in the\r\nunderwood and rocky recesses and which was prolonged by the implacable\r\nhatred of old Fumba.\r\n\r\nHowever, before Kali succeeded in quelling it, it was daylight. The\r\nsun, as is usual under the equator, rolled quickly from beyond the\r\nmountains, and flooded with a bright light the battle-field on which\r\nlay over two hundred Samburu corpses pierced by spears or crushed by\r\nmaces. After a certain time, when the battle finally ceased and only\r\nthe joyful yells of the Wahimas disturbed the morning's quiet, Kali\r\nagain appeared, but with a face so dejected and sad that it could be\r\nperceived even from a distance that some kind of misfortune had\r\novertaken him.\r\n\r\nIn fact, when he stood before Stas, he began to strike his head with\r\nhis fists and exclaim sorrowfully:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, great master!--Fumba kufa! Fumba kufa!\" (is slain).\r\n\r\n\"Slain?\" Stas repeated.\r\n\r\nKali related what had happened, and from his words it appeared that the\r\ncause of the occurrence was only the inveterate hatred of Fumba, for\r\nafter the battle had ceased, he still wanted to give the last blow to\r\ntwo Samburus, and from one of them he received the stroke of a spear.\r\n\r\nThe news spread among all the Wahimas in the twinkling of an eye and\r\naround Kali a mob gathered. A few moments later six warriors bore on\r\nspears the old king, who was not killed but fatally wounded. Before his\r\ndeath he desired to see the mighty master, the real conqueror of the\r\nSamburus, sitting on an elephant.\r\n\r\nAccordingly uncommon admiration struggled in his eyes with the dusk\r\nwith which death was dimming them, and his pale lips, stretched by\r\n\"pelele,\" whispered lowly:\r\n\r\n\"Yancig! Yancig!\"\r\n\r\nBut immediately after that his head reclined backward, his mouth opened\r\nwide--and he died.\r\n\r\nKali, who loved him, with tears threw himself upon his breast. Among\r\nthe warriors some began to strike their heads, others to proclaim Kali\r\nking and to \"yancig\" in his honor. Some fell before the young ruler on\r\ntheir faces. No one raised a voice in opposition, as the right to rule\r\nbelonged to Kali not only by law, as the oldest son of Fumba, but also\r\nas a conqueror.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, in the huts of the fetish-men in the boma on the\r\nmountain-top, resounded the savage din of the wicked Mzimu, the same as\r\nStas had heard in the first negro village, but this time it was not\r\ndirected against him but was demanding the death of the prisoners for\r\nkilling Fumba. The drums began to rumble. The warriors formed in a long\r\nhost of three men in a row and commenced a war dance around Stas, Kali,\r\nand Fumba's corpse.\r\n\r\n\"Oa, Oa! Yach, yach!\" all voices repeated; all heads nodded right and\r\nleft in unison, the whites of their eyes glistened, and the sharp\r\npoints of the spears twinkled in the morning sun.\r\n\r\nKali rose and turning to Stas, said:\r\n\r\n\"Great master, bring the 'bibi' to the boma and let her dwell in\r\nFumba's hut. Kali is king of the Wahimas and the great master is Kali's\r\nking.\"\r\n\r\nStas nodded his head in sign of assent but remained a few hours, for he\r\nand the King were entitled to a rest.\r\n\r\nHe did not leave until towards the evening. During his absence the\r\nbodies of the slain Samburus were removed and thrown into a neighboring\r\ndeep abyss, over which at once a swarm of vultures flocked; the\r\nfetish-men made preparations for Fumba's funeral and Kali assumed\r\nauthority as the only master of the life and death of all his subjects.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what Kali is?\" Stas asked the little maid on the return\r\njourney from Luela.\r\n\r\nNell gazed at him with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"He is your boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha! A boy! Kali is now king of all the Wahimas.\"\r\n\r\nThis news delighted Nell immensely. This sudden change, thanks to which\r\nthe former slave of the cruel Gebhr, and later the humble servant of\r\nStas, became a king, seemed to her something extraordinary and at the\r\nsame time exceedingly amusing.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Linde's remark that negroes were like children who were\r\nincapable of remembering what transpired the day before, did not appear\r\njust in its application to Kali, for as soon as Stas and Nell stopped\r\nat the foot of Mount Boko the young monarch hurried to meet them; he\r\ngreeted them with the usual marks of humility and joy and repeated the\r\nwords which he had previously uttered:\r\n\r\n\"Kali is the king of the Wahimas, and the great master is Kali's king.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he surrounded both with an adoration almost divine and prostrated\r\nhimself, particularly before Nell, in the presence of all the people,\r\nfor he knew from experience, acquired during the journey, that the\r\ngreat master cared more for the little \"bibi\" than for himself.\r\n\r\nLeading them solemnly to the capital boma on the summit he surrendered\r\nto them Fumba's hut, which resembled a great shed divided into several\r\nrooms. He ordered the Wahima women, who came with them from Luela, and\r\nwho could not look enough at the \"Good Mzimu,\" to place a utensil with\r\nhoney and sour milk in the first room, and when he learned that the\r\n\"bibi,\" tired by the journey, had fallen asleep, he commanded all the\r\ninhabitants to observe the deepest silence under the penalty of cutting\r\nout their tongues. But he decided to honor them still more solemnly,\r\nand with this in view, when Stas, after a brief rest, came out of the\r\nshed, he approached him and, prostrating himself, said:\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow Kali shall order Fumba to be buried and shall cause as many\r\nslaves to be cut down for Fumba and for Kali as both have fingers on\r\ntheir hands, but for the 'bibi' and for the great master, Kali shall\r\norder Faru, the son of Mamba, to be cut to pieces and 'wengi, wengi' of\r\nother Samburus who were captured by the Wahimas.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Stas knitted his brows and began to gaze with his steely eyes into\r\nKali's eyes; after which he answered:\r\n\r\n\"I forbid you to do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Master,\" the young negro said in an uncertain voice, \"the Wahimas\r\nalways cut down slaves. The old king--dies cut them down; the young\r\nsucceeds--cut them down. If Kali did not command them to be cut down,\r\nthe Wahimas would think that Kali is not king.\"\r\n\r\nStas looked more and more sternly:\r\n\r\n\"What of it?\" he asked. \"Did you not learn anything on Mount Linde, and\r\nare you not a Christian?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, oh, great master!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, then! The Wahimas have black brains, but your brains ought to\r\nbe white. You, as soon as you became their king, should enlighten them\r\nand teach them what you learned from me and from the 'bibi' They are\r\nlike jackals and like hyenas--make men of them. Tell them it is not\r\nallowable to cut down captives, for the Great Spirit to whom I and the\r\n'bibi' pray avenges the blood of the defenseless. The white people do\r\nnot murder slaves, and you want to be worse to them than Gebhr was to\r\nyou--you, a Christian! Shame on you, Kali. Change the ancient and\r\nabominable customs of the Wahimas for good ones and God will bless you\r\nfor this and the 'bibi' will not say that Kali is a savage, stupid, bad\r\nnegro.\"\r\n\r\nA horrible din in the huts of the fetish-men deafened his words. Stas\r\nwaved his hand and continued:\r\n\r\n\"I hear! That is your wicked Mzimu, which wants the blood and heads of\r\nthe captives. But you, of course, know what that means and it will not\r\nfrighten you. Well, I say this to you: take a bamboo stick, go to each\r\nhut and thrash the hides of the fetish-men until they begin to roar\r\nlouder than their drums. Cast out the drums into the middle of the\r\nboma, in order that all the Wahimas may see and understand how these\r\nknaves have deceived them. Tell your foolish Wahimas, at the same time,\r\nthat which you yourself announced to M'Rua's people, that wherever the\r\n'Good Mzimu' sojourns no human blood can be shed.\"\r\n\r\nStas' words evidently persuaded the young king, as he glanced at him\r\nboldly and said:\r\n\r\n\"Kali will beat, oh, beat the fetish-men; throw out the drums and tell\r\nthe Wahimas that there where the 'Good Mzimu' is it is not allowable to\r\nkill anyone. But what shall Kali do with Faru and with the Samburus who\r\nkilled Fumba?\"\r\n\r\nStas, who already had formed his plans for everything and who only\r\nwaited for this question, answered at once:\r\n\r\n\"Your father perished and his father perished, therefore it is a head\r\nfor a head. You shall conclude a blood alliance with Faru, after which\r\nthe Wahimas and Samburus shall dwell in harmony; they shall peacefully\r\ncultivate manioc, and hunt. You shall tell Faru of the Great Spirit,\r\nwho is the Father of all white and black people, and Faru shall love\r\nyou like a brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali now has a white brain,\" answered the young negro.\r\n\r\nAnd with this the conversation ended. A while later again resounded\r\nwild roars; this time they were not the roars of the wicked Mzimu but\r\nonly of both fetish-men, whom Kali cudgelled with all his might and\r\nmain. The warriors, who below continually surrounded the King in a\r\ncompact circle, came running up as fast as their legs could carry them\r\nto see what was happening, and soon became convinced with their own\r\neyes and from the confessions of the fetish-men that the bad Mzimu\r\nbefore which heretofore they trembled was only a hollowed-out trunk\r\nwith monkey skin stretched over it.\r\n\r\nAnd young Faru, when he was informed that in honor of the \"Good Mzimu\"\r\nand the great master his head would not be dashed to pieces, but that\r\nKali was to eat a piece of him and he a piece of Kali, could hardly\r\nbelieve his ears, and on learning to whom he was indebted for his life,\r\nlay on his face on the ground before the entrance to Fumba's hut, and\r\nremained there until Nell came out and ordered him to rise. Then he\r\nembraced with his black hands her little foot and placed it on his head\r\nin sign that through his entire life he desired to remain her slave.\r\n\r\nThe Wahimas were greatly astonished at the commands of the young king,\r\nbut the presence of the unknown guests whom they regarded as the most\r\npowerful sorcerers in the world had the effect of disarming all\r\nopposition. The older people, however, were displeased with the new\r\ncustoms, and both fetish-men, understanding that their prosperous days\r\nwere forever over, swore in their souls a terrible revenge against the\r\nking and the new arrivals.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime they buried Fumba with great solemnity at the foot of\r\nthe rock below the boma. Kali placed above his grave a cross made of\r\nbamboo, while the negroes left a few utensils with pombe and smoked\r\nmeat \"in order that he should not annoy and haunt them during the\r\nnight-time.\"\r\n\r\nMamba's body, after the conclusion of the blood brotherhood between\r\nKali and Faru, was surrendered to the Samburus.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nell, can you enumerate our journeys from Fayûm?\" Stas asked.\r\n\r\n\"I can.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this the little maid raised her eyebrows and began to count on\r\nher little fingers.\r\n\r\n\"At once. From Fayûm to Khartûm--that is one; from Khartûm to\r\nFashoda--that is the second; from Fashoda to that ravine in which we\r\nfound the King--that is the third; and from Mount Linde to the\r\nlake--that is the fourth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There probably is not another fly in the world which has flown\r\nover such a piece of Africa.\"\r\n\r\n\"That fly would look queer without you.\"\r\n\r\nStas began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"A fly on an elephant! A fly on an elephant!\"\r\n\r\n\"But not a tsetse! Honestly, Stas--not a tsetse.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, \"a very agreeable fly.\"\r\n\r\nNell, pleased with the praise, propped her little nose on his arm;\r\nafter which she asked:\r\n\r\n\"When shall we start on our fifth journey?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as you have rested thoroughly, and I can instruct those men\r\nwhom Kali has promised to me how to shoot a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"And shall we ride long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Long, Nell--long! Who knows whether it will not be the longest\r\njourney?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, as usual, will be equal to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must be.\"\r\n\r\nSomehow Stas had managed to shift for himself as best he could, but\r\nthis fifth journey required great preparations. They were to venture\r\ninto unknown regions in which they were threatened with manifold\r\ndangers, so the boy desired to be protected against them better than he\r\npreviously had been. With this in view he gave instructions in shooting\r\nfrom Remington rifles to forty young Wahimas who were to form the\r\nprincipal armed force and in a measure Nell's body-guard. More\r\nrifle-men he could not have, as the King carried only twenty-five\r\nrifles and the horses bore only fifteen. The rest of the army was to\r\nconsist of one hundred Wahimas and a hundred Samburus, armed with\r\nspears and bows, whom Faru promised to furnish, and whose presence\r\nremoved many difficulties of travel through the wide and wild country\r\ninhabited by the Samburu tribe. Stas, not without a certain pride,\r\nthought that having escaped during his journey from Fashoda with only\r\nNell and the two negroes, without any means, he might come to the ocean\r\ncoast at the head of two hundred armed men with an elephant and horses.\r\nHe pictured to himself what would be said by the English people who\r\nprized resourcefulness highly, but above all he thought of what his\r\nfather and Mr. Rawlinson would say. The thought of this sweetened all\r\nhis toils.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he was not at all at ease as to his own and Nell's fate,\r\nfor he surely would pass through the possessions of the Wahimas and the\r\nSamburus without any difficulties, but after that, what? Upon what\r\ntribes would he yet chance, into what regions would he enter, and how\r\nmuch travel still remained? Linde's directions were too vague. Stas was\r\ngreatly worried because he actually did not know where he was, as that\r\npart of Africa appeared on the maps from which he studied geography\r\nentirely like a blank page. He also had no idea what this Lake\r\nBassa-Narok was and how great it was. He was on its southern border, at\r\nwhich the width of the overflow might amount to ten miles. But neither\r\nthe Wahimas nor the Samburus could tell him how far the lake extended\r\nto the north. Kali, who knew the Kiswahili language passably well,\r\nanswered all questions with, \"Bali! bali!\" which meant \"far! far!\" but\r\nthis was all that Stas could elicit from him.\r\n\r\nAs the mountains on the north, shutting off the view, appeared quite\r\nnear, he assumed that it was a small, brackish lake, like many others\r\nin Africa. A few years later it appeared how great an error he\r\ncommitted* [* It was the great lake which was discovered in 1888 by the\r\ncelebrated traveler Teleki and which he named Lake Rudolf.]. For the\r\ntime being, however, he was not concerned so much about ascertaining\r\nthe exact dimensions of Bassa-Narok as whether some river did not flow\r\nout of it, which afterwards coursed to the ocean. The\r\nSamburus--subjects of Faru--claimed that east of their country lay a\r\nwaterless desert which no one had yet traversed. Stas, who knew negroes\r\nfrom the narratives of travelers, from Linde's adventures, and partly\r\nfrom his own experience, was aware that when the dangers and the\r\nhardships began, many of his men would desert to return home, and\r\nperhaps not one would remain. In such case he would find himself in the\r\nwilds and desert with only Nell, Mea, and little Nasibu. Above all he\r\nunderstood that a lack of water would disperse the caravan at once, and\r\nfor that reason he inquired so eagerly about the river. Going along its\r\ncourse, they really might avoid those horrors to which travelers in\r\nwaterless regions are exposed.\r\n\r\nBut the Samburus could not tell him anything definite; he himself could\r\nnot make any longer explorations of the eastern shore of the lake, for\r\nother employment kept him at Boko. He reckoned that in all probability\r\nnone of the kites that he flew from Mount Linde and from the negro\r\nvillages had crossed the chain of mountains surrounding Bassa-Narok.\r\nFor this reason it was necessary to make and fly new ones, for these\r\nthe wind could now carry across the flat desert far away--perhaps as\r\nfar as the ocean. Now this work he had to supervise personally. For\r\nthough Nell could glue them perfectly, and Kali had learned how to fly\r\nthem, neither of them were able to inscribe on them all that it was\r\nnecessary to write. Stas regarded this as a matter of great importance\r\nwhich it was not allowable to neglect.\r\n\r\nSo this labor occupied so much of his time that the caravan was not\r\nready for the journey until three weeks had elapsed. But on the eve of\r\nthe day on which they were to start at daybreak the young King of the\r\nWahimas appeared before Stas and, bowing profoundly, said:\r\n\r\n\"Kali goes with the master and the 'bibi' as far as the water on which\r\ngreat pirogues of the white people float.\"\r\n\r\nStas was touched by this proof of attachment; nevertheless, he thought\r\nthat he had no right to take the boy with him upon such an immense\r\njourney, a return from which might be uncertain.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want to go with us?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Kali loves the great master and the 'bibi'.\"\r\n\r\nStas placed the palm of his hand on Kali's woolly head.\r\n\r\n\"I know, Kali, that you are an honest and good boy. But what will\r\nbecome of your kingdom and who will govern the Wahimas in your place?\"\r\n\r\n\"M'Tana, brother of Kali's mother.\"\r\n\r\nStas knew that strife for rulership raged among the negroes and power\r\nlured them the same as the white people; so he pondered for a while and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"No, Kali. I cannot take you with me. You must remain with the Wahimas\r\nin order to make good people of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali will return to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"M'Tana has many sons-- Well, what will happen if he himself should\r\ndesire to become king and leave the kingdom to his sons, and should\r\ninduce the Wahimas to expel you?\"\r\n\r\n\"M'tana  is good. He would not do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if he should do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Kali will again go to the great water--to the great master and\r\nthe 'bibi.'\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall not be there then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Kali will sit beside the water and weep from grief.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus he crossed his hands above his head; after a while he\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\"Kali loves the great master and the 'bibi' very much--very much!\"\r\n\r\nAnd two big tears glistened in his eyes.\r\n\r\nStas hesitated how to act. He was sorry for Kali, nevertheless, he did\r\nnot assent to his entreaty. He understood--not to speak of the dangers\r\nof return--that if M'Tana or the fetish-men stirred up the negroes,\r\nthen the boy was threatened not only with expulsion from the country\r\nbut with death.\r\n\r\n\"It is better for you to remain,\" he said, \"better without question.\"\r\n\r\nBut while he was saying this, Nell entered. Through the thin mat which\r\nseparated the rooms she had heard perfectly the whole conversation, and\r\nnow seeing tears in Kali's eyes she began to wipe his eyelids with her\r\nlittle fingers, and afterward turned to Stas:\r\n\r\n\"Kali is going with us,\" she said with great firmness.\r\n\r\n\"Oho!\" answered Stas, somewhat ruffled, \"that does not depend upon you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali is going with us,\" she repeated.\r\n\r\n\"No, he will not go.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stamped her little foot.\r\n\r\n\"I want it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she burst into a genuine flood of tears.\r\n\r\nStas stared at her with the greatest amazement, as though he did not\r\nunderstand what had happened to the little maid who was always so good\r\nand gentle, but seeing that she stuck both of her little fists in her\r\neyes and, like a little bird, caught the air with her opened mouth, he\r\nbegan to exclaim with great haste:\r\n\r\n\"Kali is going with us! He is going! He is going! Why are you crying?\r\nHow unbearable you are! He is going! My, how pale you are! He is going!\r\nDo you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd thus it happened. Stas was ashamed until the evening of his\r\nweakness for the \"Good Mzimu,\" and the \"Good Mzimu\" having carried her\r\npoint, was as quiet, gentle, and obedient as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe caravan started at daybreak on the following day. The young negro\r\nwas happy, the little female despot was now gentle and obedient, and\r\nStas was full of energy and hope. They were accompanied by one hundred\r\nSamburus and one hundred Wahimas--forty of the latter were armed with\r\nRemingtons from which they could shoot passably well. The white\r\ncommander who drilled them during three weeks knew, indeed, that in a\r\ngiven case they would create more noise than harm, but thought that in\r\nmeeting savages noise plays no less a part than bullets, and he was\r\npleased with his guards. They took with them a great supply of manioc,\r\ncakes baked of big, fat white ants and ground into flour, as well as a\r\ngreat quantity of smoked meats. Between ten and twenty women went with\r\nthe caravan. They carried various good things for Nell and water-bags\r\nmade of antelope skin. Stas, from the King's back, kept order, issued\r\ncommands--perhaps not so much because they were necessary, but because\r\nhe was intoxicated by the role of a commander--and with pride viewed\r\nhis little army.\r\n\r\n\"If I wanted to,\" he said to himself, \"I could remain the king of all\r\nthe people of Doko, like Beniowsky in Madagascar.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a thought flitted through his head whether it would not be well to\r\nreturn here sometime, conquer a great tract of country, civilize the\r\nnegroes, found in that locality a new Poland, or even start at the head\r\nof a drilled black host for the old. As he felt, however, that there\r\nwas something ludicrous in the idea and as he doubted whether his\r\nfather would permit him to play the role of the Macedonian Alexander in\r\nAfrica, he did not confide his plans to Nell, who certainly would be\r\nthe only person in the world ready to applaud them.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, before subjugating that region of Africa, it was necessary\r\nabove all things to get out of it, so he occupied himself with nearer\r\nmatters. The caravan stretched out in a long string. Stas, sitting on\r\nthe King's neck, decided to ride at the end in order to have everything\r\nand everybody in sight.\r\n\r\nNow when the people passed by him, one after another, he observed, not\r\nwithout surprise, that the two fetishmen, M'Kunje and M'Pua--the same\r\nwho had received a drubbing at Kali's hands--belonged to the caravan\r\nand that they set out with packs on their heads together with the\r\nothers on the road.\r\n\r\nSo he stopped them and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Who ordered you to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"The king,\" they answered, bowing humbly.\r\n\r\nBut under the mask of humility their eyes glittered savagely and their\r\nfaces reflected such malice that Stas at once wanted to drive them\r\naway, and if he did not do it, it was only because he did not want to\r\nundermine Kali's authority.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he summoned him at once.\r\n\r\n\"Did you order the fetish-men to go with us?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Kali ordered it, for Kali is wise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall ask you why your wisdom did not leave them at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because if M'Kunje and M'Pua remain they would instigate the Wahimas\r\nto kill Kali upon his return, but if we take them with us Kali will be\r\nable to watch them.\"\r\n\r\nStas meditated for a while and said:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right; nevertheless, do not lose sight of them, day or\r\nnight, for they have a wicked look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali will have bamboo sticks,\" the young negro replied.\r\n\r\nThe caravan proceeded. Stas at the last moment ordered the guard, armed\r\nwith Remingtons, to close the procession, as they were men chosen by\r\nhim, and most reliable. During the drills, which lasted quite long,\r\nthey had become attached in a certain degree to this young commander,\r\nand at the same time, as the nearest to his august person, they\r\nregarded themselves as something better than the others. At present\r\nthey were to watch over the whole caravan and seize those who should\r\ntake a fancy to desert. It was to be foreseen that when the hardships\r\nand dangers began deserters would not be lacking.\r\n\r\nBut the first day everything proceeded in the best possible manner. The\r\nnegroes with the burdens on their heads, each one armed with a bow and\r\na few smaller javelins or so-called assagais, extended in a long\r\nserpentine column amidst the jungle. For some time they skirted along\r\nthe southern shore of the lake over the level ground, but as the lake\r\nwas surrounded on all sides by high peaks they had to climb mountains\r\nwhen they turned to the east. The old Samburus, who knew that locality,\r\nclaimed that the caravan would have to cross high passes between the\r\nmountains which they called Kullal and Inro, after which they would\r\nenter into the Ebene country, lying south of Borani. Stas understood\r\nthat they could not go directly east for he remembered that Mombasa was\r\nsituated a few degrees beyond the equator and therefore considerably\r\nsouth of that unknown lake. Possessing a few compasses which Linde\r\nleft, he did not fear that he would stray from the proper road.\r\n\r\nThe first night they lodged upon a wooded hill. With the coming of\r\ndarkness a few scores of camp-fires blazed, at which the negroes\r\nroasted dried meat and ate a dough of manioc roots, picking it out of\r\nthe utensils with their fingers. After appeasing their hunger and\r\nthirst they were gossiping among themselves as to where the \"Bwana\r\nkubwa\" would lead them and what they would receive from him for it.\r\nSome sang, squatting and stirring up the fire, while all talked so long\r\nand so loudly that Stas finally had to command silence in order that\r\nNell should sleep.\r\n\r\nThe night was very cold, but the next day, when the first rays of the\r\nsun illuminated the locality, it became warm at once. About sunrise the\r\nlittle travelers saw a strange sight. They were just approaching a\r\nlittle lake over a mile wide, or rather a great slough formed by the\r\nrains in the mountain valley, when suddenly Stas, sitting with Nell on\r\nthe King, and looking about the region through a field-glass, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Look, Nell! Elephants are going to the water.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, at a distance of about five hundred yards could be seen a\r\nsmall herd composed of five heads, approaching the little lake slowly\r\none after the other.\r\n\r\n\"These are some kind of strange elephants,\" Stas said, gazing at them\r\nwith keen attention; \"they are smaller than the King, their ears are\r\nfar smaller, and I do not see any tusks at all.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the elephants entered the water but did not stop at the\r\nshore, as the King usually did, and did not begin to splash with their\r\ntrunks, but going continually ahead they plunged deeper and deeper\r\nuntil finally only their backs protruded above the water like boulders\r\nof stone.\r\n\r\n\"What is this? They are diving!\" Stas exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe caravan approached considerably towards the shore and finally was\r\nclose by it. Stas halted it and began to stare with extraordinary\r\nastonishment now at Nell, then at the lake.\r\n\r\nThe elephants could not be seen at all; in the smooth watery pane even\r\nwith the naked eye could be distinguished five spots like round red\r\nflowers, jutting above the surface and rocking with a light motion.\r\n\r\n\"They are standing on the bottom and those are the tips of their\r\ntrunks,\" Stas said, not believing his own eyes. Then he shouted to Kali:\r\n\r\n\"Kali, did you see them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master, Kali sees. Those are water-elephants,\"* [* Africa\r\ncontains many uninvestigated secrets. Rumors of water-elephants reached\r\nthe ears of travelers but were given no credence. Recently M. Le Petit,\r\nsent to Africa by the Museum of Natural History, Paris, saw\r\nwater-elephants on the shores of Lake Leopold in Congo. An account of\r\nthis can be found in the German periodical \"Kosmos,\" No. 6.] answered\r\nthe young negro quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Water-elephants?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali has seen them often.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do they live in water?\"\r\n\r\n\"During the night they go to the jungle and feed and during the day\r\nthey live in the lake the same as a kiboko (hippopotamus). They do not\r\ncome out until after sunset.\"\r\n\r\nStas for a long time could not recover from his surprise, and were it\r\nnot that it was urgent for him to proceed on his way he would have\r\nhalted the caravan until night in order to view better these singular\r\nanimals. But it occurred to him that the elephants might emerge from\r\nthe water on the opposite side, and even if they came out nearer it\r\nwould be difficult to observe them closely in the dusk.\r\n\r\nHe gave the signal for the departure, but on the road said to Nell:\r\n\r\n\"Well! We have seen something which the eyes of no European have ever\r\nseen. And do you know what I think?--that if we reach the ocean safely\r\nnobody will believe us when I tell them that there are water-elephants\r\nin Africa.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you caught one and took him along with us to the ocean?\" Nell\r\nsaid, in the conviction that Stas as usual would be able to accomplish\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter ten days' journey the caravan finally crossed the depressions in\r\nthe crests of mountains and entered into a different country. It was an\r\nimmense plain, broken here and there by small hills, but was mainly\r\nlevel. The vegetation changed entirely. There were no big trees, rising\r\nsingly or in clumps over the wavy surface of the grass. Here and there\r\nprojected at a considerable distance from each other acacias yielding\r\ngum, with coral-hued trunks, umbrella-like, but with scant foliage and\r\naffording but little shade. Among the white-ant hillocks shot upwards\r\nhere and there euphorbias, with boughs like the arms of a candle-stick.\r\nIn the sky vultures soared, and lower there flew from acacia to acacia\r\nbirds of the raven species with black and white plumage. The grass was\r\nyellow and, in spike, looked like ripe rye. But, nevertheless, that dry\r\njungle obviously supplied food for a great number of animals, for\r\nseveral times each day the travelers met considerable herds of\r\nantelopes, hartbeests, and particularly zebras. The heat on the open\r\nand treeless plain became unbearable. The sky was cloudless, the days\r\nwere excessively hot, and the night did not bring any rest.\r\n\r\nThe journey became each day more and more burdensome. In the villages\r\nwhich the caravan encountered, the extremely savage populace received\r\nit with fear, but principally with reluctance, and if it were not for\r\nthe large number of armed guards as well as the sight of the white\r\nfaces, the King, and Saba, great danger would have threatened the\r\ntravelers.\r\n\r\nWith Kali's assistance Stas was able to ascertain that farther on there\r\nwere no villages and that the country was waterless. This was hard to\r\nbelieve, for the numerous herds which they encountered must have drunk\r\nsomewhere. Nevertheless, the account of the desert, in which there were\r\nno rivers nor sloughs, frightened the negroes and desertions began. The\r\nfirst example was set by M'Kunje and M'Pua. Fortunately their escape\r\nwas detected early, and pursuers on horseback caught them not far from\r\nthe camp; when they were brought back Kali, with the aid of the bamboo\r\nsticks, impressed upon them the impropriety of their conduct. Stas,\r\nassembling all the guards, delivered a speech to them, which the young\r\nnegro interpreted into the native language. Taking advantage of the\r\nfact that at the last stopping place lions roared all night about the\r\ncamp, Stas endeavored to convince his men that whoever ran away would\r\nunavoidably become their prey, and even if he passed the night on\r\nacacia boughs the still more terrible \"wobo\" would find him there. He\r\nsaid afterwards that wherever the antelopes live there must be water,\r\nand if in the further course of their journey they should chance upon a\r\nregion entirely destitute of water, they could take enough of it with\r\nthem in bags of antelope skin for two or three days' journey. The\r\nnegroes, hearing his words, repeated every little while, one after\r\nanother: \"Oh, mother, how true that is, how true!\" but the following\r\nnight five Samburus and two Wahimas ran away, and after that every\r\nnight somebody was missing.\r\n\r\nM'Kunje and M'Pua did not, however, try their fortune a second time for\r\nthe simple reason that Kali at sunset ordered them to be bound.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the country became drier and drier, and the sun scorched\r\nthe jungle unmercifully. Even acacias could not be seen. Herds of\r\nantelopes appeared continually but in smaller numbers. The donkey and\r\nthe horses yet found sufficient food, as under the high, dry grass was\r\nhidden in many places lower grass, greener and less dry. But the King,\r\nthough he was not fastidious, grew lean. When they chanced upon an\r\nacacia he broke it with his head, and nibbled diligently its leaves and\r\neven the pods of the previous year. The caravan indeed came upon water\r\nevery day, but frequently it was so bad that it had to be filtered or\r\nelse it was unfit even for the elephant to drink. Afterwards it\r\nhappened several times that the men, sent in advance, returned under\r\nKali's command, not finding a slough nor a stream hidden in the earth's\r\nfissures, and Kali with troubled face would announce: \"Madi apana\" (no\r\nwater).\r\n\r\nStas understood that this last journey would not be any easier than the\r\nprevious ones and began to worry about Nell, as changes were taking\r\nplace in her. Her little face, instead of tanning from the sun and\r\nwind, became each day paler and her eyes lost their usual luster. On\r\nthe dry plain, free from mosquitoes, she was not threatened with fever,\r\nbut it was apparent that the terrible heat was wasting the little\r\nmaid's strength. The boy, with compassion and with fear, now gazed at\r\nher little hands, which became as white as paper, and bitterly\r\nreproached himself because, having lost so much time in the preparation\r\nand in drilling the negroes to shoot, he had exposed her to a journey\r\nin a season of the year so parching.\r\n\r\nAmid these fears day after day passed. The sun drank up the moisture\r\nand the life out of the soil more and more greedily and unmercifully.\r\nThe grass shriveled and dried up to such a degree that it crumbled\r\nunder the hoofs of the antelopes, and herds, rushing by, though not\r\nnumerous, raised clouds of dust. Nevertheless, the travelers chanced\r\nonce more upon a little river, which they recognized by a long row of\r\ntrees growing on its banks. The negroes ran in a race towards the trees\r\nand, reaching the bank, lay flat on it, dipping their heads and\r\ndrinking so greedily that they stopped only when a crocodile seized the\r\nhand of one of their number. Others rushed to their companion's rescue\r\nand in one moment they pulled out of the water the loathsome lizard,\r\nwhich, however, did not let go of the man's hand though his jaws were\r\nopened with spears and knives. The matter was only terminated by the\r\nKing who, placing his foot on him, crushed him as easily as if he were\r\na mouldy mushroom.\r\n\r\nWhen the men finally quenched their thirst, Stas ordered the erection\r\nin the shallow water of a round enclosure of high bamboos with only one\r\nentrance from the bank, in order that Nell might bathe with perfect\r\nsafety. And at the entrance he stationed the King. The bath greatly\r\nrefreshed the little maid and a rest restored her strength somewhat.\r\n\r\nTo the great joy of the whole caravan and Nell, \"Bwana kubwa\" decided\r\nto stop two days near this water. At this news the men fell into\r\nexcellent humor and at once forgot the toils they had endured. After\r\ntaking a nap and refreshments the negroes began to wander among the\r\ntrees above the river, looking for palms bearing wild dates and\r\nso-called \"Job's tears,\" from which necklaces are made. A few of them\r\nreturned to the camp before sunset, carrying some square objects which\r\nStas recognized as his own kites.\r\n\r\nOne of these kites bore the number 7, which was evidence that it was\r\nsent out from Mount Linde, as the children flew from that place a few\r\nscore. Stas was hugely overjoyed at this sight and it gave him renewed\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n\"I did not expect,\" he said to Nell, \"that kites could fly such a\r\ndistance. I was certain that they would remain on the summits of\r\nKaramojo and I only let them fly prepared for any accident. But now I\r\nsee that the wind can carry them where it wants to and I have a hope\r\nthat those which we sent from the mountains surrounding Bassa-Narok,\r\nand now on the road, will fly as far as the ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"They surely will,\" Nell answered.\r\n\r\n\"God grant,\" the boy acquiesced, thinking of the dangers and hardships\r\nof the further journey.\r\n\r\nThe caravan started from the river on the third day, taking with them a\r\ngreat supply of water in leather bags. Before nightfall they again\r\nentered upon a region grilled by the sun, in which not even acacias\r\ngrew, and the ground in some places was as bare as a threshing-floor.\r\nSometimes they met passion-flowers with trunks imbedded in the ground\r\nand resembling monstrous pumpkins two yards in diameter. In these huge\r\nglobes there shot out lianas as thin as string, which, creeping over\r\nthe ground, covered immense distances, forming a thicket so\r\nimpenetrable that it would be difficult even for mice to penetrate it.\r\nBut notwithstanding the beautiful color of these plants, resembling the\r\nEuropean acanthus, there were so many thorns in them that neither the\r\nKing nor the horses could find any nourishment in them. Only the donkey\r\nnibbled them cautiously.\r\n\r\nSometimes in the course of several English miles they did not see\r\nanything except coarse, short grass and low plants, like immortelles,\r\nwhich crumbled upon being touched. After a night's bivouac, during the\r\nwhole of the following day a living fire descended from heaven. The air\r\nquivered as on the Libyan Desert. In the sky there was not even a\r\ncloudlet. The earth was so flooded with light that everything appeared\r\nwhite, and not a sound, not even the buzz of insects, interrupted this\r\ndeadly stillness surfeited with an ill-omened luster.\r\n\r\nThe men were dripping with sweat. At times they deposited their packs\r\nof dried meats and shields in one pile to find a little shade under\r\nthem. Stas issued orders to save the water, but the negroes are like\r\nchildren, who have no thought of the morrow. Finally it was necessary\r\nto surround with a guard those who carried the supplies of water and to\r\napportion the water to each one separately. Kali attended to this very\r\nconscientiously, but this consumed a great deal of time and delayed the\r\nmarch, and therefore the finding of some kind of watering-place. The\r\nSamburus complained in addition that the Wahimas got more than their\r\nshare to drink, and the Wahimas that the Samburus were favored. These\r\nlatter began to threaten to return, but Stas declared to them that Faru\r\nwould cut off their heads. He himself ordered the men armed with\r\nRemingtons to go on guard and not let any one leave.\r\n\r\nThe next night was passed upon a level plain. They did not build a\r\nboma, or, as the Sudânese say, a zareba, for there was nothing to build\r\none with. The duties of sentinel were performed by the King and Saba.\r\nThis was sufficient, but the King, who received only a tenth of the\r\nwater he needed, trumpeted for it until sunrise, and Saba, with hanging\r\ntongue, turned his eyes towards Stas and Nell in mute appeal for even\r\none drop. The little maid wanted Stas to give him a mouthful from a\r\nrubber flask left by Linde, which Stas carried with a string across his\r\nshoulder, but he was saving this remnant for the little one in the dark\r\nhour; therefore he declined.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day towards evening only five bags with water remained,\r\nor not quite half a cupful for each member of the party. As the nights,\r\nhowever, at any rate were cooler than the days, and the thirst at such\r\ntimes vexed them less than under the burning rays of the sun, and as\r\nthe people had received in the morning a small quantity of water, Stas\r\nordered those bags saved for the following day. The negroes grumbled at\r\nthis order, but fear of Stas was still great; so they did not dare to\r\nrush at this last supply, especially as near it stood a guard of two\r\nmen armed with Remingtons, the guard being changed every hour.\r\n\r\nThe Wahimas and Samburus cheated their thirst by pulling out blades of\r\npoor grass and chewing its roots. Nevertheless, there was almost no\r\nmoisture in it, as the inexorable sun burnt it, even below the earth's\r\nsurface.* [*About the waterless plains in this region see the excellent\r\nbook, entitled \"Kilima-Njaro,\" by the Rev. Mr. Le Roy, at present\r\nBishop of Gabon.]\r\n\r\nSleep, though it did not quench their thirst, at least permitted them\r\nto forget it; so when night followed, the men, weary and exhausted with\r\nthe whole day's march, dropped as though lifeless, wherever they\r\nstopped, and fell into deep slumber. Stas also fell asleep, but in his\r\nsoul he had too many worries and was disturbed too much to sleep\r\npeacefully and long. After a few hours he awoke and began to meditate\r\non what was to come, and where he could secure water for Nell, and for\r\nthe whole caravan, together with the people and the animals. His\r\nsituation was hard and perhaps horrible, but the resourceful boy did\r\nnot yet yield to despair. He began to recall all the incidents, from\r\nthe time of their abduction from Fayûm until that moment: the great\r\njourney across the Sahara, the hurricane in the desert, the attempts to\r\nescape, Khartûm, the Mahdi, Fashoda, their liberation from Gebhr's\r\nhands; afterwards the further journey after Linde's death until\r\nreaching Lake Bassa-Narok and that place at which they were passing the\r\nnight. \"So much did we undergo, so much have we suffered,\" he\r\nsoliloquized, \"so often did it seem that all was lost and that there\r\nwas no help; nevertheless, God aided me and I always found help. Why,\r\nit is impossible that, after having passed over such roads and gone\r\nthrough so many terrible dangers, we should perish upon this the last\r\njourney. Now we have yet a little water and this region--why, it is not\r\na Sahara, for if it were the people would know about it.\"\r\n\r\nBut hope was mainly sustained in him by this, that on the southeast he\r\nespied through the field-glass some kind of misty outlines as though of\r\nmountains. Perhaps they were hundreds of English miles away, perhaps\r\nmore. But if they succeeded in reaching them, they would be saved, as\r\nmountains are seldom waterless. How much time that would consume was\r\nsomething he could not compute for it all depended upon the height of\r\nthe mountains. Lofty peaks in such transparent atmosphere as that of\r\nAfrica can be seen at an immeasurable distance; so it was necessary to\r\nfind water before that time. Otherwise destruction threatened them.\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary,\" Stas repeated to himself.\r\n\r\nThe harsh breathing of the elephant, who exhaled from his lungs as best\r\nhe could the burning heat, interrupted every little while the boy's\r\nmeditations. But after a certain time it seemed to him that he heard\r\nsome kind of sound, resembling groans, coming from the direction in\r\nwhich the water-bags lay covered in the grass for the night. As the\r\ngroans were repeated several times, he rose to see what was happening\r\nand, walking towards the grass plot a few score paces distant from the\r\ntent, he perceived two dark bodies lying near each other and two\r\nRemington barrels glistening in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\"The negroes are always the same,\" he thought; \"they were to watch over\r\nthe water, more precious now to us than anything in the world, and both\r\nwent to sleep as though in their own huts. Ah! Kali's bamboo will have\r\nsome work to do to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this impression he approached and shook the foot of one of the\r\nsentinels, but at once drew back in horror.\r\n\r\nThe apparently sleeping negro lay on his back with a knife sticking in\r\nhis throat up to the handle and beside him was the other, likewise cut\r\nso terribly that his head was almost severed from the trunk.\r\n\r\nTwo bags with water had disappeared; the other three lay in the\r\nlittered grass, slashed and sunken.\r\n\r\nStas felt that his hair stood on end.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to his shout Kali was the first to come rushing; after him\r\ncame the two guardsmen who were to relieve the previous watch, and a\r\nfew moments later all the Wahimas and Samburus assembled at the scene\r\nof the crime, shouting and yelling. A commotion, full of cries and\r\nterror, ensued. The people were concerned not so much about the slain\r\nand the murderers as about the water which soaked into the parched\r\njungle soil. Some negroes threw themselves upon the ground and, clawing\r\nout with their fingers lumps of earth, sucked out the remnants of\r\nmoisture. Others shouted that evil spirits had murdered the guards and\r\nslashed the bags. But Stas and Kali knew what it all meant. M'Kunje and\r\nM'Pua were missing from those men howling above that grass patch. In\r\nthat which had happened there was something more than the murder of two\r\nguards and the theft of water. The remaining slashed bags were evidence\r\nthat it was an act of revenge and at the same time a sentence of death\r\nfor the whole caravan. The priests of the wicked Mzimu revenged\r\nthemselves upon the good one. The fetish-men revenged themselves upon\r\nthe young king who exposed their frauds and did not permit them to\r\ndeceive the ignorant Wahimas. Now the wings of death stretched over the\r\nentire caravan like a hawk over a flock of doves.\r\n\r\nKali recollected too late that, having his mind troubled and engrossed\r\nwith something else, he forgot to have the fetish-men bound, as from\r\nthe time of their flight he had ordered them to be each evening. It was\r\napparent that both sentinels, watching the water, through inbred negro\r\ncarelessness, lay down and fell asleep. This facilitated the work of\r\nthe rogues and permitted them to escape unpunished.\r\n\r\nBefore the confusion subsided somewhat and the people recovered from\r\ntheir consternation, considerable time elapsed; nevertheless, the\r\nassassins could not be far away, as the ground under the cut bags was\r\nmoist and the blood which flowed from both of the slain did not yet\r\ncoagulate. Stas issued an order to pursue the runaways not only for the\r\npurpose of punishing them, but also to recover the last two bags of\r\nwater. Kali, mounting a horse and taking with him about thirteen\r\nguardsmen, started in pursuit. Stas at first wanted to take part in it,\r\nbut it occurred to him that he could not leave Nell alone among the\r\nexcited and enraged negroes; so he remained. He only directed Kali to\r\ntake Saba along with him.\r\n\r\nHe himself remained, for he feared a downright mutiny, particularly\r\namong the Samburus. But in this he was mistaken. The negroes as a rule\r\nbreak out easily, and sometimes for trivial causes, but when crushed by\r\na great calamity and particularly when the inexorable hand of death\r\nweighs upon them, they submit passively; not only those whom Islam\r\nteaches that a struggle with destiny is vain, but all others. Then\r\nneither terror nor the moments of torture can arouse them from their\r\ntorpor. It happened thus at this time. The Wahimas, as well as the\r\nSamburus, when the first excitement passed away and the idea that they\r\nmust die definitely found lodgment in their minds, lay down quietly on\r\nthe ground waiting for death; in view of which not a mutiny was to be\r\nfeared, but rather that on the morrow they would not want to rise and\r\nstart upon their further journey. Stas, when he observed this, was\r\nseized by a great pity for them.\r\n\r\nKali returned before daybreak and at once placed before Stas two bags\r\ntorn to pieces, in which there was not a drop of water.\r\n\r\n\"Great Master,\" he said, \"madi apana!\"\r\n\r\nStas rubbed his perspiring forehead with his hand; after which he said:\r\n\r\n\"And M'Kunje and M'Pua?\"\r\n\r\n\"M'Kunje and M'Pua are dead,\" Kali replied.\r\n\r\n\"Did you order them to be killed?\"\r\n\r\n\"A lion or 'wobo' killed them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to relate what happened. The bodies of the two murderers\r\nwere found quite far from the camp at the place where they met death.\r\nBoth lay close to each other, both had skulls crushed from behind,\r\nlacerated shoulders, and gnawed spines. Kali assumed that when the\r\n\"wobo\" or lion appeared before them in the moonlight they fell on their\r\nfaces before it and began to entreat it that it should spare their\r\nlives. But the terrible beast killed both, and afterwards, having\r\nappeased its hunger, scented water and tore the bags to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"God punished them,\" Stas said, \"and the Wahimas should be convinced\r\nthat the wicked Mzimu is incapable of rescuing any one.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Kali added:\r\n\r\n\"God punished them, but we have no water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Far ahead of us in the east I saw mountains. There must be water\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kali sees them also, but it is many, many days to them.\"\r\n\r\nA moment of silence followed.\r\n\r\n\"Master,\" spoke out Kali, \"let the 'Good Mzimu'--let the 'bibi' beg the\r\nGreat Spirit for rain or for a river.\"\r\n\r\nStas left him, making no reply. But before the tent he saw Nell's\r\nlittle figure; the shouts and yells had awakened her some time before.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened, Stas?\" she asked, running up to him.\r\n\r\nAnd he placed his hand on her little head and solemnly said:\r\n\r\n\"Nell, pray to God for water; otherwise we all shall perish.\"\r\n\r\nSo the little maiden upraised her pale little face and, fastening her\r\neyes on the moon's silvery shield, began to implore for succor Him who\r\nin heaven causes the stars to revolve and on earth tempers the wind for\r\nthe shorn lamb.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a sleepless, noisy, and anxious night the sun rolled upon the\r\nhorizon suddenly, as it always does under the equator, and a bright day\r\nfollowed. On the grass there was not a drop of dew; on the sky not a\r\ncloudlet. Stas ordered the guards to assemble the men and delivered a\r\nshort speech to them. He declared to them that it was impossible to\r\nreturn to the river now, for they of course well knew that they were\r\nseparated from it by five days' and nights' journey. But on the other\r\nhand no one knew whether there was not water in the opposite direction.\r\nPerhaps even not far away they would find some stream, some rivulet or\r\nslough. Trees, indeed, could not be seen, but it often happens upon\r\nopen plains where the strong gale carries away the seeds, trees do not\r\ngrow even at the water-side. Yesterday they saw some big antelopes and\r\na few ostriches running towards the east, which was a sign that yonder\r\nthere must be some watering place, and in view of this whoever is not a\r\nfool and whoever has in his bosom a heart, not of a hare but of a lion\r\nor buffalo, will prefer to move forward, though in thirst and pain,\r\nrather than to lie down and wait there for vultures or hyenas.\r\n\r\nAnd saying this, he pointed with his hand at the vultures, a few of\r\nwhich coursed already in an ill-omened circle above the caravan. After\r\nthese words the Wahimas, whom Stas commanded to rise, stood up almost\r\nas one man, for, accustomed to the dreadful power of kings, they did\r\nnot dare to resist. But many of the Samburus, in view of the fact that\r\ntheir king Faru remained at the lake, did not want to rise, and these\r\nsaid among themselves: \"Why should we go to meet death when she herself\r\nwill come to us?\" In this manner the caravan proceeded, reduced almost\r\none-half, and it started from the outset in torture. For twenty-four\r\nhours the people had not had a drop of water or any other fluid in\r\ntheir mouths. Even in a cooler climate this, at labor, would have been\r\nan unendurable suffering; and how much more so in this blazing African\r\nfurnace in which even those who drink copiously perspire the water so\r\nquickly that almost at the same moment they can wipe it off their skin\r\nwith their hands. It was also to be foreseen that many of the men would\r\ndrop on the way from exhaustion and sunstroke. Stas protected Nell as\r\nbest he could from the sun and did not permit her to lean for even a\r\nmoment out of the palanquin, whose little roof he covered with a piece\r\nof white percale in order to make it double. With the rest of the\r\nwater, which he still had in the rubber bottle, he prepared a strong\r\ntea for her and handed it to her when cooled off, without any sugar,\r\nfor sweets increase thirst. The little girl urged him with tears to\r\ndrink also; so he placed to his lips the bottle in which there remained\r\nscarcely a few thimblefuls of water, and, moving his throat, pretended\r\nthat he drank it. At the moment when he felt the moisture on his lips\r\nit seemed to him that his breast and stomach were aflame and that if he\r\ndid not quench that flame he would drop dead. Before his eyes red spots\r\nbegan to flit, and in his jaws he felt a terrible pain, as if some one\r\nstuck a thousand pins in them. His hands shook so that he almost spilt\r\nthese last drops. Nevertheless, he caught only two or three in his\r\nmouth with his tongue; the rest he saved for Nell.\r\n\r\nA day of torture and toil again passed, after which, fortunately, a\r\ncooler night came. But the following morning the intense heat became\r\nterrible. There was not a breath of air. The sun, like an evil spirit,\r\nravaged with living flame the parched earth. The borders of the horizon\r\nwhitened. As far as the eyes reached not even euphorbias could be seen.\r\nNothing--only a burnt, desolate plain, covered with tufts of blackened\r\ngrass and heather. From time to time there resounded in the\r\nimmeasurable distance light thunder, but this in fair skies proclaims\r\nnot storms but a drought.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, when the heat became the greatest, it was necessary to\r\nhalt. The caravan broke ranks in gloomy silence. It appeared that one\r\nhorse fell and about thirteen of the guards remained on the road.\r\nDuring the rest nobody thought of eating. The people had sunken eyes\r\nand cracked lips and on them dried clots of blood. Nell panted like a\r\nbird, so Stas surrendered to her the rubber bottle, and exclaiming: \"I\r\ndrank! I drank!\" he ran to the other side of the camp, for he feared\r\nthat if he remained he would snatch that water from her or would demand\r\nthat she should share it with him. This perhaps was his most heroic act\r\nduring the course of the journey. He himself, however, began to suffer\r\nhorribly. Before his eyes there flew continually the red patches. He\r\nfelt a tightening of his jaws so strongly that he opened and closed\r\nthem with difficulty. His throat was dry, burning; there was no saliva\r\nin his mouth; the tongue was as though wooden. And of course this was\r\nbut the beginning of the torture for him and for the caravan.\r\n\r\nThe thunder announcing the drought resounded incessantly on the\r\nhorizon's border. About three o'clock, when the sun passed to the\r\nwestern side of the heavens, Stas ordered the caravan to rise and\r\nstarted at its head towards the east. But now hardly seventy men\r\nfollowed him, and every little while some one of them lay down beside\r\nhis pack to rise nevermore. The heat decreased a few degrees but was\r\nstill terrible. The still air was permeated as though with the gas of\r\nburning charcoal. The people had nothing to breathe and the animals\r\nbegan to suffer no less. In an hour after the start again one of the\r\nhorses fell. Saba panted and his flanks heaved; from his blackened\r\ntongue not a drop of froth fell. The King, accustomed to the dry\r\nAfrican jungle, apparently suffered the least, but he began to be\r\nvicious. His little eyes glittered with a kind of strange light. To\r\nStas, and particularly to Nell, who from time to time talked to him, he\r\nanswered still with a gurgle, but when Kali carelessly came near him he\r\ngrunted menacingly and waved his trunk so that he would have killed the\r\nboy if he had not jumped aside in time.\r\n\r\nKali's eyes were bloodshot, the veins in his neck were inflated, and\r\nhis lips cracked the same as the other negroes. About five o'clock he\r\napproached Stas and, in a hollow voice which with difficulty issued out\r\nof his throat, said:\r\n\r\n\"Great master, Kali can go no further. Let the night come here.\"\r\n\r\nStas overcame the pain in his jaws and answered with an effort:\r\n\r\n\"Very well. We will stop. The night will bring relief.\"\r\n   \"It will bring death,\" the young negro whispered.\r\n\r\nThe men threw the loads off their heads, but as the fever in their\r\nthickened blood already reached the highest degree, on this occasion\r\nthey did not immediately lie down on the ground. Their hearts and the\r\narteries in their temples, hands, and limbs pulsated as if in a moment\r\nthey would burst. The skin of their bodies, drying up and shrinking,\r\nbegan to itch; in their bones they were sensible of an excessive\r\ndisquiet and in their entrails and throats a fire. Some walked uneasily\r\namong the packets; others could be seen farther away in ruddy rays of\r\nthe setting sun as they strolled one after another among the dried\r\ntufts as though seeking something, and this continued until their\r\nstrength was entirely exhausted. Then they fell in turn on the ground\r\nand lay in convulsions. Kali sat, squatting near Stas and Nell,\r\ncatching the air with open mouth, and began to repeat entreatingly\r\nbetween one breath and the other:\r\n\r\n\"Bwana kubwa, water.\"\r\n\r\nStas gazed at him with a glassy stare and remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"Bwana kubwa, water!\"\r\n\r\nAnd after a while:\r\n\r\n\"Kali is dying.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, Mea, who for an unknown reason endured thirst the easiest and\r\nsuffered the least of all, approached, sat close to him, and, embracing\r\nhis neck with her arms, said in her quiet, melodious voice.\r\n\r\n\"Mea wants to die together with Kali.\"\r\n\r\nA long silence followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the sun set and night covered the region. The sky\r\nbecame dark-blue. On its southern side the Cross glistened. Above the\r\nplain a myriad of stars twinkled. The moon came out from under the\r\nearth and began to satiate the darkness with light, and on the west\r\nwith the waning and pale twilight extended the zodiacal luminosity. The\r\nair was transformed into a great luminous gulf. The ever-increasing\r\nluster submerged the region. The palanquin, which remained forgotten on\r\nthe King's back, and the tents glistened, just as whitewashed houses\r\nglisten in a bright night. The world sank into silence and sleep\r\nencompassed the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd in the presence of this stillness and this quiet of nature the\r\npeople howled from pain and waited for death. On the silvery background\r\nof the darkness the gigantic black form of the elephant was strongly\r\noutlined. The moon's beams illuminated besides the tents, Stas' and\r\nNell's dresses and, amid tufts of heather, the dark, shriveled bodies\r\nof the negroes and, scattered here and there, piles of packages. Before\r\nthe children sat, propped on his fore legs, Saba, and, raising his head\r\ntowards the moon's shield, he howled mournfully.\r\n\r\nIn Stas' soul oscillated only the remnants of thought, changed into a\r\ngloomy and despairing feeling that this time there was no help and that\r\nall those prodigious toils and efforts, those sufferings, those acts of\r\nwill and courage, which he had performed during the terrible\r\njourney--from Medinet to Khartûm, from Khartûm to Fashoda, and from\r\nFashoda to the unknown lake--would avail naught, and that an inexorable\r\nend of the struggle and of life was approaching. And this appeared to\r\nhim all the more horrible because this end came during the time of the\r\nfinal journey, at the termination of which lay the ocean. Ah! He would\r\nnot now conduct little Nell to the coast; he would not convey her by a\r\nsteamer to Port Said, would not surrender her to Mr. Rawlinson; he\r\nhimself would not fall into his father's arms and would not hear from\r\nhis lips that he had acted like a brave boy and like a true Pole! The\r\nend, the end! In a few days the sun would shine only upon the lifeless\r\nbodies and afterwards would dry them up into a semblance of those\r\nmummies which slumber in an eternal sleep in the museums in Egypt.\r\n\r\nFrom torture and fever his mind began to get confused. Ante-mortem\r\nvisions and delusions of hearing crowded upon him. He heard distinctly\r\nthe voices of the Sudânese and Bedouins yelling \"Yalla! Yalla!\" at the\r\nspeeding camels. He saw Idris and Gebhr. The Mahdi smiled at him with\r\nhis thick lips, asking: \"Do you want to drink at the spring of\r\ntruth?\"--Afterwards the lion gazed at him from the rock; later Linde\r\ngave him a gallipot of quinine and said: \"Hurry, hurry, for the little\r\none will die.\" And in the end he beheld only the pale, very dear little\r\nface and two little hands stretched out towards him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he trembled and consciousness returned to him for a moment,\r\nfor hard by murmured the quiet whisper of Nell, resembling a moan:\r\n\r\n\"Stas--water!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she, like Kali previously, looked to him only for help.\r\n\r\nBut as twelve hours before he had given her the last drop, he now\r\nstarted up suddenly, and exclaimed in a voice in which vibrated an\r\noutburst of pain, despair, and affliction:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Nell, I only pretended that I was drinking! For three days I have\r\nhad nothing in my mouth!\"\r\n\r\nAnd clasping his head with both hands he ran away in order not to look\r\nat her sufferings. He rushed blindly among tufts of grass and heather\r\nuntil he fell upon one of the tufts. He was unarmed. A leopard, lion,\r\nor even a big hyena would find in him an easy prey. But only Saba came\r\nrunning to him. Having smelt at him on all sides, he again began to\r\nhowl, as if summoning aid for him.\r\n\r\nNobody, however, hurried with aid. Only from above, the moon, quiet and\r\nindifferent, looked on him. For a long time the boy lay like dead. He\r\nwas revived only by a cooler breath of wind, which unexpectedly blew\r\nfrom the east. Stas sat up and after a while attempted to rise to\r\nreturn to Nell.\r\n\r\nThe cooler wind blew a second time. Saba ceased howling and, turning\r\ntowards the east, began to dilate his nostrils. Suddenly he barked once\r\nor twice a short, broken bass and dashed ahead. For some time he could\r\nnot be heard, but soon his barking again resounded. Stas rose and,\r\nstaggering on his numb legs, began to look after him. Long journeys,\r\nlong stays in the jungle, the necessity of holding all his senses in\r\ncontinual restraint, and continual dangers had taught the boy to pay\r\ncareful heed to everything which was taking place about him. So,\r\nnotwithstanding the tortures he felt at that moment, notwithstanding\r\nhis half-conscious mind, through instinct and habit he watched the\r\nbehavior of the dog. And Saba, after the lapse of a certain time, again\r\nappeared near him, but was somewhat strangely agitated and uneasy. A\r\nfew times he raised his eyes at Stas, ran around, again rushed ahead,\r\nscenting and barking in the heather; again he came back and finally,\r\nseizing the boy's clothes, began to pull him in a direction opposite to\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nStas completely recovered his senses.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" he thought. \"Either the dog's mind, from thirst, is\r\ndisordered or he has scented water. But no! If water was near he would\r\nhave run to it to drink and would have wet jaws. If it was far away, he\r\nwould not have scented it--water has no smell. He is not pulling me to\r\nantelopes, for he did not want to eat during the evening. Nor to beasts\r\nof prey. Well, what is it?\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly his heart began to beat in his bosom yet more strongly.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the wind brought him the odor of men?--Perhaps--in the\r\ndistance there is some negro village?--Perhaps one of the kites has\r\nflown as far--Oh, merciful Christ! Oh, Christ!--\"\r\n\r\nAnd under the influence of a gleam of hope he regained his strength and\r\nbegan to run towards the camp, notwithstanding the obstinacy of the\r\ndog, who incessantly barred his way. In the camp Nell's form loomed\r\nwhite before him and her weak voice reached him: after a while he\r\nstumbled over Kali lying on the ground, but he paid no heed to\r\nanything. Reaching the pack in which the sky-rockets were, he tore it\r\nopen and drew out one of them. With trembling hands he tied it to a\r\nbamboo stick, planted it in a crack in the ground, struck a match and\r\nlit the string of the tube hanging at the bottom.\r\n\r\nAfter a while a red snake flew upwards with a sputter and a sizzle.\r\nStas seized a bamboo pole with both hands in order not to fall and\r\nfixed his eyes on the distance. His pulse and his temples beat like\r\nsledge hammers; his lips moved in fervent prayer. His last breath, and\r\nin it his whole soul, he sent to God.\r\n\r\nOne minute passed, another, a third, and a fourth. Nothing! Nothing!\r\nThe boy's hand dropped, his head bowed to the ground, and immense grief\r\nflooded his tortured breast.\r\n\r\n\"In vain! In vain!\" he whispered. \"I will go and sit beside Nell and we\r\nwill die together.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment far, far away on the silvery background of the moonlit\r\nnight, a fiery ribbon suddenly soared upward and scattered into golden\r\nstars, which fell slowly, like great tears, upon the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Succor!\" Stas shouted.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately these people, who were half-dead a short time before,\r\ndashed pell-mell in a race across tufts of shrubs and grass. After the\r\nfirst sky-rocket, a second and third appeared. After that the breeze\r\nbrought a report as though of tapping, in which it was easy to divine\r\ndistant shots. Stas ordered all the Remingtons to be fired, and from\r\nthat time the colloquy of rifles was not interrupted at all and became\r\nmore and more distinct. The boy, sitting on a horse, which also as\r\nthough by a miracle recovered its strength, and keeping Nell before\r\nhim, dashed across the plain towards the saving sounds. Beside him\r\nrushed Saba and after him trumpeted the gigantic King. The two camps\r\nwere separated by a space of a few miles, but as from both sides they\r\ndrew to each other simultaneously, the whole trip did not last long.\r\nSoon the rifle shots could not only be heard but seen. Yet one last\r\nsky-rocket flew out in the air not farther than a few hundred paces.\r\nAfter that numerous lights glistened. The slight elevation of the\r\nground hid them for a while, but when Stas passed it he found himself\r\nalmost in front of a row of negroes holding in their hands burning\r\ntorches.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the row were two Europeans, in English helmets and with\r\nrifles in their hands.\r\n\r\nWith one glance of the eye Stas recognized them as being Captain Glenn\r\nand Doctor Clary.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the Captain Glenn and Doctor Clary expedition was not at\r\nall to find Stas and Nell. It was a large and abundantly equipped\r\ngovernment expedition despatched to explore the eastern and northern\r\nslopes of the gigantic mountain Kilima-Njaro, as well as the\r\nlittle-known vast regions lying north of that mountain. The captain as\r\nwell as the doctor knew indeed about the abduction of the children from\r\nMedinet el-Fayûm, as intelligence of it was published in the English\r\nand Arabian papers, but they thought that both were dead or were\r\ngroaning in slavery under the Mahdi, from whom thus far not a European\r\nhad been rescued. Clary, whose sister married Rawlinson in Bombay and\r\nwho was very much charmed by little Nell during the trip to Cairo, felt\r\nkeenly her loss. But with Glenn, he mourned also for the brave boy.\r\nSeveral times they sent despatches from Mombasa to Mr. Rawlinson asking\r\nwhether the children were found, and not until the last unfavorable\r\nreply, which came a considerable time before the starting of the\r\ncaravan, did they finally lose all hope.\r\n\r\nAnd it never even occurred to them that the children imprisoned in\r\ndistant Khartûm could appear in that locality. Often, however, they\r\nconversed about them in the evening after finishing their daily labors,\r\nfor the doctor could by no means forget the beautiful little girl.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the expedition advanced farther and farther. After a\r\nlong stay on the eastern slope of Kilima-Njaro, after exploring the\r\nupper courses of the Sabak and Tany rivers, as well as Kenia Mountain,\r\nthe captain and doctor turned in a northerly direction, and after\r\ncrossing the marshy Guasso-Nijiro they entered upon a vast plain,\r\nuninhabited and frequented by countless herds of antelopes. After three\r\nmonths of travel the men were entitled to a long rest, so Captain\r\nGlenn, discovering a small lake of wholesome brown water, ordered tents\r\nto be pitched near it and announced a ten days' stop.\r\n\r\nDuring the stop the white men were occupied with hunting and arranging\r\ntheir geographical and scientific notes, and the negroes devoted\r\nthemselves to idleness, which is always so sweet to them. Now it\r\nhappened one day that Doctor Clary, shortly after he arose, when\r\napproaching the shore, observed between ten and twenty natives of\r\nZanzibar, belonging to the caravan, gazing with upturned faces at the\r\ntop of a high tree and repeating in a circle:\r\n\r\n\"Ndege? Akuna ndege? Ndege?\" (A bird? Not a bird? A bird?)\r\n\r\nThe doctor was short-sighted, so he sent to his tent for a field-glass;\r\nafterwards he looked through it at the object pointed out by the\r\nnegroes and great astonishment was reflected upon his countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Ask the captain to come here,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBefore the negroes reached him the captain appeared in front of the\r\ntent, for he was starting on an antelope-hunt.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Glenn,\" the doctor said, pointing with his hand upwards.\r\n\r\nThe captain, in turn, turned his face upwards, shaded his eyes with his\r\nhand, and was astonished no less than the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"A kite,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but the negroes do not fly kites. So where did it come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps some kind of white settlement is located in the vicinity or\r\nsome kind of mission.\"\r\n\r\n\"For three days the wind has blown from the west, or from a region\r\nunknown and in all probability as uninhabited as this jungle. You know\r\nthat here there are no settlements or missions.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is really curious.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had better get that kite.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary. Perhaps we may ascertain where it came from.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain gave the order. The tree was a few tens of yards high, but\r\nthe negroes climbed at once to the top, removed carefully the\r\nimprisoned kite, and handed it to the doctor who, glancing at it, said:\r\n\r\n\"There is some kind of inscription on it. We'll see.\" And blinking with\r\nhis eyes he began to read.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his face changed, his hands trembled.\r\n\r\n\"Glenn,\" he said, \"take this, read it, and assure me that I did not get\r\na sunstroke and that I am in my sound mind.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain took the bamboo frame to which a sheet was fastened and\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nelly Rawlinson and Stanislas Tarkowski, sent from Khartûm to Fashoda\r\nand conducted from Fashoda east from the Nile, escaped from the\r\ndervishes. After long months' travel they arrived at a lake lying south\r\nof Abyssinia. They are going to the ocean. They beg for speedy help.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the side of the sheet they found the following addition written in\r\nsmaller letters:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This kite, the 54th in order, was flown from the mountains surrounding\r\na lake unknown to geography. Whoever finds it should notify the\r\nDirectory of the Canal at Port Said or Captain Glenn in Mombasa.\r\n\r\nStanislas Tarkowski.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the captain's voice died away, the two friends gazed at each other\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" Doctor Clary finally asked.\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe my own eyes!\" the captain answered.\r\n\r\n\"This, of course, is no illusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is plainly written, 'Nelly Rawlinson and Stanislas Tarkowski.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Most plainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they may be somewhere in this region.\"\r\n\r\n\"God rescued them, so it is probable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank Him for that,\" exclaimed the doctor fervently. \"But where shall\r\nwe seek them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no more on the kite?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are a few other words but in the place torn by the bough. It is\r\nhard to read them.\"\r\n\r\nBoth leaned their heads over the sheet and only after a long time were\r\nthey able to decipher:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The rainy season passed long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"That the boy lost the computation of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in this manner he endeavored to indicate the date, therefore this\r\nkite may have been sent up not very long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is so, they may not be very far from here.\"\r\n\r\nThe feverish, broken conversation lasted for a while, after which both\r\nbegan to scrutinize the document and discuss every word inscribed upon\r\nit. The thing appeared, however, so improbable that if it were not for\r\nthe fact that this occurred in a region in which there were no\r\nEuropeans at all--about three hundred and seventy-five miles from the\r\nnearest coast--the doctor and the captain would have assumed that it\r\nwas an ill-timed joke, which had been perpetrated by some European\r\nchildren who had read the newspapers describing the abduction, or by\r\nwards of missions. But it was difficult not to believe their eyes; they\r\nhad the kite in hand and the little rubbed inscriptions were plainly in\r\nblack before them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there were many things which they could not comprehend.\r\nWhere did the children get the paper for the kite? If it had been\r\nfurnished to them by a caravan, then they would have joined it and\r\nwould not have appealed for help. For what reason did the boy not\r\nattempt to fly with his little companion to Abyssinia? Why did the\r\ndervishes send them east of the Nile into an unknown region? In what\r\nmanner did they succeed in escaping from the hands of the guards? Where\r\ndid they hide? By what miracle through long months of journey did they\r\nnot die from starvation, or become the prey of wild animals? Why were\r\nthey not killed by savages? To all these questions there was no reply.\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand it, I do not understand it,\" repeated Doctor\r\nClary; \"this is perhaps a miracle of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" the captain answered.\r\n\r\nAfter which he added:\r\n\r\n\"But that boy! For that, of course, was his work.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he did not abandon the little one. May the blessings of God flow\r\nupon his head!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stanley--even Stanley would not have survived three days under these\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"And nevertheless they live.\"\r\n\r\n\"But appeal for help. The stop is ended. We start at once.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened. On the road both friends scrutinized the document\r\ncontinually in the conviction that they might obtain from it an inkling\r\nof the direction in which it was necessary for them to go with help.\r\nBut directions were lacking. The captain led the caravan in a zigzag\r\nway, hoping that he might chance upon some trace, some extinct fire, or\r\na tree with a sign carved on the bark. In this manner they advanced for\r\na few days. Unfortunately they entered afterwards upon a plain,\r\nentirely treeless, covered with high heather and tufts of dried grass.\r\nUneasiness began to possess both friends. How easy it was to miss each\r\nother in that immeasurable expanse, even with a whole caravan; and how\r\nmuch more so two children, who, as they imagined, crept like two little\r\nworms somewhere amid heather higher than themselves! Another day\r\npassed. Neither fires at night nor tin boxes, with notes in them,\r\nfastened on the tufts helped them any. The captain and the doctor at\r\ntimes began to lose hope of ever succeeding in finding the children\r\nand, particularly, of finding them alive.\r\n\r\nThey sought for them zealously, however, during the following days. The\r\npatrols, which Glenn sent right and left, finally reported to him that\r\nfarther on began a desert entirely waterless; so when they accidentally\r\ndiscovered cool water in a cleft it was necessary to halt in order to\r\nreplenish their supplies for the further journey.\r\n\r\nThe cleft was rather a fissure, a score of yards deep and comparatively\r\nnarrow. At its bottom flowed a warm spring, seething like boiling\r\nwater, for it was saturated with carbonic acid. Nevertheless, it\r\nappeared that the water, after cooling, was good and wholesome. The\r\nspring was so abundant that the three hundred men of the caravan could\r\nnot exhaust it. On the contrary the more water they drew from it the\r\nmore it flowed, and filled the fissure higher.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps sometime,\" Doctor Clary said, \"this place will be a resort for\r\nthe health-seeker, but at present this water is inaccessible for\r\nanimals because the walls of the fissure are too steep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could the children chance upon a similar spring?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. It may be that more of them can be found in this\r\nlocality. But if not, then without water they must perish.\"\r\n\r\nNight fell. Fires were lit. Nevertheless, a boma was not erected, for\r\nthere was nothing to build one with. After the evening refreshments,\r\nthe doctor and the captain sat upon folding chairs, and lighting their\r\npipes, began to converse of that which lay most upon their hearts.\r\n\r\n\"Not a trace,\" declared Clary.\r\n\r\n\"It had occurred to me,\" Glenn replied, \"to send ten of our men to the\r\nocean coast with a despatch that there is news of the children. But I\r\nam glad that I did not do that, as the men would perish on the way,\r\nand, even if they reached the coast, why should we awaken vain hopes?\"\r\n\r\n\"And revive the pain--\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor removed the white helmet from his head and wiped his\r\nperspiring forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" he said; \"if we should return to that lake and order the men\r\nto hew down trees and at night light a gigantic bonfire, perhaps the\r\nchildren might descry it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they were near we would find them anyway, and if they are far off\r\nthe rolling ground would hide the fire. Here the plain is seemingly\r\nlevel, but in reality is in knobs, wavy as the ocean. Besides, by\r\nretreating we would definitely lose the possibility of finding even\r\ntraces of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak candidly. You have no hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, we are grown-up, strong, and resourceful men, and think\r\nof what would become of us if we two were here alone, even with\r\nweapons--but without supplies and men--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! alas--yes! I picture to myself the two children going in such a\r\nnight across the desert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hunger, thirst, and wild animals.\"\r\n\r\n\"And nevertheless the boy writes that under such conditions they\r\nproceeded for long months.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is also something in that which passes my comprehension.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time could be heard amid the stillness only the sizzling of\r\nthe tobacco in the pipes. The doctor gazed into the depth of the night,\r\nafter which he said in a subdued voice:\r\n\r\n\"It is already late, but sleep has deserted me. And to think that they,\r\nif alive, are straying somewhere in the moonlight amid these dry\r\nheathers--alone--such children! Do you remember, Glenn, the little\r\none's angelic countenance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember it, and cannot forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I would allow my hand to be cut off, if--\"\r\n\r\nAnd he did not finish, for Glenn started up suddenly as if scalded.\r\n\r\n\"A sky-rocket in the distance!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\n\"A sky-rocket!\" repeated the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Some kind of caravan is ahead of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which might have found the children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps. Let us hurry to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forward!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain's orders resounded in one moment throughout the camp. The\r\nZanzibarians sprang up suddenly on their feet. Soon torches were lit.\r\nGlenn in reply to the distant signal directed that a few rockets, one\r\nafter the other, be sent up; and afterwards that the salvo of rifle\r\nshots be continued. Before a quarter of an hour elapsed the whole camp\r\nwas on the way.\r\n\r\nFrom the distance shots replied. There was no doubt that this was some\r\nkind of European caravan, appealing, from unknown reasons, for help.\r\n\r\nThe captain and the doctor raced forward, swept alternately by fear and\r\nhope. Would they find the children or would they not? The doctor said\r\nin his soul that, if not, they in the further journey could seek only\r\nfor their remains amid those terrible heather-bushes.\r\n\r\nAfter a half-hour one of those knobs, of which they had spoken before,\r\nobstructed the further view of the friends. But they were already so\r\nnear that they heard distinctly the clatter of a horse's hoofs. In a\r\nfew minutes, and on the top of the elevation, appeared a rider, holding\r\nbefore him a white object.\r\n\r\n\"Torches up,\" commanded Glenn.\r\n\r\nIn the same moment the rider brought his horse into the circle of light.\r\n\r\n\"Water! Water!\"\r\n\r\n\"The children!\" Doctor Clary cried.\r\n\r\n\"Water!\" Stas repeated.\r\n\r\nAnd he almost hurled Nell into the captain's arms and leaped out of the\r\nsaddle.\r\n\r\nBut immediately he staggered, and fell like a corpse upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nJoy in the camp of Captain Glenn and Doctor Clary was boundless, but\r\nthe curiosity of both Englishmen was subjected to a severe test. For if\r\npreviously they could not comprehend how the children by themselves\r\ncould cross those vast wilds and deserts separating that region from\r\nthe Nile and Fashoda, then at present they could not at all understand\r\nin what manner \"the little Pole,\" as they called Stas, not only\r\naccomplished that but appeared before them as the leader of a caravan,\r\narmed with European weapons--with an elephant bearing a palanquin, with\r\nhorses, tents, and a considerable supply of provisions. At the sight of\r\nthis, the captain spread out his arms and said every little while:\r\n\"Clary, I have seen a great deal but I have not seen such a boy,\"--and\r\nthe honest doctor repeated with no less astonishment: \"And he rescued\r\nthe little one from slavery and saved her!\" After which he hastened to\r\nthe tents to see how the children were and whether they slept well.\r\n\r\nAnd the children, having appeased their thirst and hunger and changed\r\ntheir clothes, slept as though slain, during the whole of the following\r\nday; the people in their caravan did the same. Captain Glenn tried to\r\nquestion Kali about Stas' deeds and adventures during the journey, but\r\nthe young negro, opening one eye, only answered: \"The great master can\r\ndo everything,\"--and again fell asleep. It positively became necessary\r\nto postpone questions and explanations for a few days.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the two friends conferred over the return journey to\r\nMombasa. They had, as it was, penetrated farther and explored more\r\nterritory than they were commissioned to; they decided, therefore, to\r\nreturn without delay. The captain indeed was lured very much by that\r\nlake unknown to geography, but a regard for the health of the children\r\nand a desire to return them as quickly as possible to their afflicted\r\nfathers prevailed. The doctor insisted, however, that it would be\r\nnecessary to rest on the cool heights of Kenia Mountain or Mount\r\nKilima-Njaro. From there they also decided to send news to the parents\r\nand summon them to come to Mombasa.\r\n\r\nThe return journey began, after due rest and baths in the warm springs,\r\non the third day. It was at the same time a day of parting from Kali.\r\nStas persuaded the little one that to take him farther with them--to\r\nthe ocean or to Egypt--would be selfishness on their part. He said to\r\nher that in Egypt, and even in England, Kali would be nothing more than\r\na servant, while when he assumed the government of his nation, he, as\r\nking, could spread and establish Christianity, soften the savage\r\ncustoms of the Wahimas, and make of them not only a civilized but a\r\ngood people. The same thing he repeated in substance to Kali.\r\n\r\nAt the leave-taking, however, a multitude of tears were shed of which\r\neven Stas was not ashamed, for he and Nell had passed with Kali through\r\nmany evil and good moments and not only had learned to appreciate his\r\nhonest heart, but had conceived a sincere affection for him. The young\r\nnegro lay long at the feet of his \"Bwana kubwa\" and the \"Good Mzimu.\"\r\nTwice he returned to look at them for a while, but finally the moment\r\nof separation came and the two caravans started in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nIt was only during the journey that the narrative of the adventures of\r\nthe two little travelers began. Stas, at one time prone to be a trifle\r\nboastful, now did not brag at all. He simply had performed too many\r\ngreat deeds, he had undergone too much, and was too developed not to\r\nunderstand that words should not be greater than acts. There was, after\r\nall, enough of deeds, though related in the most modest manner. Each\r\nday during the scorching \"white hours\" and at evening during the stops\r\nthere glided before the eyes of Captain Glenn and Doctor Clary\r\npictures, as it were, of those occurrences and incidents through which\r\nthe children had passed. So they saw the kidnapping from\r\nMedinet-el-Fayûm and the awful journey on camel-back across the\r\ndesert--and Khartûm and Omdurmân, resembling hell on earth, and the\r\nill-boding Mahdi. When Stas related his reply to the Mahdi, when the\r\nlatter tried to induce him to change his faith, both friends rose and\r\neach of them warmly shook Stas' right hand, after which the captain\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi is not living!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Mahdi is not living?\" Stas repeated with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" spoke out the doctor. \"He choked himself with his own fat, or,\r\nin other words, he died of heart trouble, and the succession of his\r\ngovernment has been assumed by Abdullahi.\"\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said Stas. \"He did not expect when he despatched us for our\r\ndestruction to Fashoda that death would first overtake him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd later he added:\r\n\r\n\"But Abdullahi is still more cruel than the Mahdi.\"\r\n\r\n\"For that reason mutinies and massacres have already begun,\" the\r\ncaptain replied, \"and the whole edifice which the Mahdi reared will\r\nsooner or later tumble down.\"\r\n\r\n\"And after that who will succeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"England,\" the captain answered.* [*The reign of Abdullahi continued\r\nfor ten years. The decisive blow to the dervish power was delivered by\r\nLord Kitchener, who almost totally annihilated them in a great bloody\r\nbattle and afterwards ordered the Mahdi's tomb to be razed.]\r\n\r\nIn the further course of the journey, Stas told about his journey to\r\nFashoda, about the death of old Dinah, of their start from Fashoda to\r\nuninhabited regions, and their search for Smain in them. When he\r\nreached that part where he killed the lion and afterwards Gebhr,\r\nChamis, and the two Bedouins, the captain interrupted him with only two\r\nwords: \"All right!\" after which he again squeezed his right hand, and\r\nwith Clary listened with increasing interest about the taming of the\r\nKing, about settling in Cracow, about Nell's fever, of finding Linde,\r\nand the kites which the children sent up from Karamojo Mountains. The\r\ndoctor who, with each day, became more and more deeply attached to\r\nlittle Nell, was impressed so much by everything which threatened her\r\nmost, that from time to time he had to strengthen himself with a few\r\nswallows of brandy, and when Stas began to narrate how she almost\r\nbecame the prey of the dreadful \"wobo\" or \"abasanto,\" he caught the\r\nlittle maid in his arms as if in fear that some new beast of prey was\r\nthreatening her life.\r\n\r\nAnd what he and the captain thought of Stas was best evidenced by two\r\ndespatches, which within two weeks after their arrival at the\r\nfoot-hills of Kilima-Njaro they expressly sent to the captain's deputy\r\nin Mombasa with instructions that the latter should transmit them to\r\nthe fathers. The first one, edited carefully, for fear that it should\r\ncreate too astounding a sensation, and forwarded to Port Said,\r\ncontained the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to boy, favorable news about children. Come to Mombasa.\"\r\n\r\nThe second, more explicit, addressed to Aden, was of this purport:\r\n\r\n\"Children are with us. Well. Boy a hero.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the cool heights at the foot of Kilima-Njaro they stopped fifteen\r\ndays, as Doctor Clary insisted that this was imperative for Nell's\r\nhealth, and even for Stas'. The children with their whole souls admired\r\nthis heaven-kissing mountain, which possesses all the climates of the\r\nworld. Its two peaks, Kibo and Kima-Wenze, during daytime were most\r\nfrequently hidden in thick fogs. But when in fair nights the fogs\r\nsuddenly dispersed and from the twilight the eternal snows on\r\nKima-Wenze blushed with a rosy luster at a time when the whole world\r\nwas plunged in darkness, the mountain appeared like a bright altar of\r\nGod, and the hands of both children at this sight involuntarily were\r\nfolded in prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Stas the days of worry, uneasiness and exertion had passed. They\r\nhad yet before them a month of travel to Mombasa and the road led\r\nthrough the charming but unhealthy forest of Taveta; but how much\r\neasier it was to travel now, with a numerous caravan well provided with\r\neverything and over familiar trails, than formerly to stray in the\r\nwilderness with only Kali and Mea. Besides, Captain Glenn was now\r\nresponsible for the journey. Stas rested and hunted. Aside from this,\r\nhaving found among the implements of the caravan a chisel and hammers,\r\nhe was in the cooler hours engaged in chiseling upon a great gneiss\r\nrock the inscription \"Jeszcze Polska nie zginela,\"* [* \"Poland is not\r\nyet lost.\" The title of the most popular Polish national\r\nmarch.--_Translator's note_.] for he wished to leave some trace of\r\ntheir sojourn in that region.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen, to whom he translated the inscription, were astonished\r\nthat it never occurred to the boy to perpetuate his own name on that\r\nrock. But he preferred to carve the words he had chosen.\r\n\r\nHe did not cease, however, to take care of Nell and awoke in her such\r\nunbounded confidence that when Clary asked her whether she did not fear\r\nthe storms on the Red Sea, the little maid raised her beautiful, calm\r\neyes and only answered, \"Stas will know what to do.\" Captain Glenn\r\nclaimed that truer evidence of what Stas was to the little one and\r\ngreater praise for the boy no one would be able to pronounce.\r\n\r\nThough the first despatch to Pan Tarkowski at Port Said had been worded\r\nwith much care, it nevertheless created such a powerful sensation that\r\njoy almost killed Nell's father. But Pan Tarkowski, though he was an\r\nexceptionally self-controlled person, in the first moments after the\r\nreceipt of the despatch, knelt in prayer and began to beseech God that\r\nthe intelligence should not prove to be a delusion, a morbid chimera,\r\nbred from sorrow, longing, and pain. Why, they had both toiled so hard\r\nto learn that the children were even alive! Mr. Rawlinson had\r\ndespatched to the Sudân whole caravans, while Pan Tarkowski, disguised\r\nas an Arab, had penetrated with the greatest danger to his life as far\r\nas Khartûm, but all was futile. The men who could have given any news\r\ndied of smallpox, of starvation, or perished during the continual\r\nmassacres, and of the children there was not the slightest clue. In the\r\nend both fathers lost all hope and lived only on recollections, in the\r\ndeep conviction that here in life now nothing awaited them and that\r\nonly death would unite them with those dearest beings who were\r\neverything for them in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime unexpected joy, almost beyond their strength, fell upon\r\nthem. But it was linked with uncertainty and amazement. Neither could\r\nby any means comprehend in what manner news of the children came from\r\nthat part of Africa, that is, Mombasa. Pan Tarkowski supposed that they\r\nmight have been ransomed or stolen by some Arabian caravan which from\r\nthe eastern coast ventured into the interior for ivory and penetrated\r\nas far as the Nile. The words of the despatch, \"Thanks to boy,\" he\r\nexplained in this manner: that Stas had notified the captain and the\r\ndoctor by letter where he with Nell could be found. Nevertheless, many\r\nthings it was impossible to unravel. On the other hand, Pan Tarkowski\r\nunderstood quite clearly that the information not only was favorable,\r\nbut very favorable, as otherwise the captain and the doctor would not\r\nhave dared to awaken hopes in them, and above all would not have\r\nsummoned them to Mombasa.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the journey were brief, and the second day after\r\nthe receipt of the despatches both engineers, with Nell's teacher, were\r\non the deck of a great steamer of the \"Peninsular and Oriental\r\nCompany,\" which was en route for India and on the way stopped at Aden,\r\nMombasa, and Zanzibar. At Aden awaited them the second despatch:\r\n\"Children are with us. Well. Boy a hero.\" After reading it Mr.\r\nRawlinson walked about almost out of his senses from joy, and,\r\nsqueezing Pan Tarkowski's palm, he repeated: \"You see, it was he who\r\nsaved her. To him I owe her life.\" Pan Tarkowski, not desiring to\r\ndisplay too much weakness, answered only, setting his teeth, \"Yes! The\r\nboy acquitted himself bravely,\" but when he retired to the privacy of\r\nhis cabin he wept from happiness. At last the hour arrived when the\r\nchildren fell into the embraces of their fathers. Mr. Rawlinson seized\r\nhis recovered little treasure in his arms and Pan Tarkowski long\r\nclasped his heroic boy to his bosom. Their misfortune disappeared as\r\npass away whirlwinds and storms of the desert. Their lives were filled\r\nanew with serenity and happiness; longing and separation had augmented\r\ntheir joy. But the children were surprised that the hair of their\r\n\"papas\" had whitened completely during the separation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey returned to Suez on a splendid French steamer belonging to the\r\n\"Messageries Maritimes Company,\" which was full of travelers from the\r\nislands Réunion, Mauritius, Madagascar, and Zanzibar. When the news\r\nspread that on board were children who had escaped from dervish slavery\r\nStas became an object of general curiosity and universal praise. But\r\nthe happy quartette preferred to lock themselves in a great cabin which\r\nthe captain gave up to them and spend there the cooler hours in\r\nnarrations. Nell, too, took part in them, chirping like a little bird,\r\nand at the same time, to the amusement of all, beginning each sentence\r\nwith an \"and.\" So, sitting on her father's knees and raising to him her\r\nbeautiful little eyes, she spoke in this manner: \"And, papa, they\r\nkidnapped us and conveyed us on camels--and Gebhr struck me--and Stas\r\ndefended me--and we came to Khartûm and there people died of\r\nhunger--and Stas worked to get dates for me--and we were at the\r\nMahdi--and Stas did not want to change his religion--and the Mahdi sent\r\nus to Fashoda--and afterwards Stas killed a lion and all of them--and\r\nwe lived in a big tree, which is called Cracow--and the King was with\r\nus--and I had a fever and Stas cured me--and killed a wobo and\r\nconquered the Samburus--and was always very kind to me--papa!\"\r\n\r\nIn the same fashion she spoke about Kali, Mea, the King, Saba, Mount\r\nLinde, the kites, and the final journey until their meeting with the\r\ncaptain's and doctor's caravan. Mr. Rawlinson, listening to this\r\nchirping, checked his tears with difficulty, while Pan Tarkowski could\r\nnot contain himself from pride and happiness, for even from these\r\nchildish narratives it appeared that were it not for the bravery and\r\nenergy of the boy the little one ran the risk of perishing, not once\r\nbut a thousand times, without help.\r\n\r\nStas gave a more specific and complete account of everything. And it\r\nhappened that during the narration of the journey from Fashoda to the\r\nwaterfall, a great load fell off his heart, for when he told how he\r\nshot Gebhr and his companions, he hemmed and hawed and began to look\r\nuneasily at his father, while Pan Tarkowski knitted his brow, pondered\r\na while, and after that gravely said:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Stas! It is not allowable for any one to be lavish with death,\r\nbut if anybody menaces your fatherland or puts in jeopardy the life of\r\nyour mother, sister, or the life of a woman entrusted to your care,\r\nshoot him in the head and ask no questions. Do not reproach yourself on\r\nthat account.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rawlinson immediately after the return to Port Said took Nell to\r\nEngland, where he settled permanently. Stas was sent by his father to a\r\nschool in Alexandria, where his deeds and adventures were less known.\r\nThe children corresponded almost daily, but circumstances combined to\r\nprevent their seeing each other for ten years. The boy, after finishing\r\nschool in Egypt, entered the Polytechnic in Zurich, after which, having\r\nsecured his diploma, he was engaged in the construction of tunnels in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nWhen ten years had passed, Pan Tarkowski retired from the service of\r\nthe Canal Company, and he and Stas visited their friends in England.\r\nMr. Rawlinson invited them to his home, near Hampton Court, for the\r\nwhole summer. Nell had finished her eighteenth year and had grown into\r\na maiden as charming as a flower, and Stas became convinced, at the\r\nexpense of his own peace, that a man, who had completed twenty-four\r\nyears, could nevertheless still think of ladies. He even thought of\r\nbeautiful and dear Nell so incessantly that finally he decided to run\r\naway to whatever place his eyes would lead him.\r\n\r\nBut while in that state of mind, Mr. Rawlinson one day placed both of\r\nhis palms on Stas' shoulders and, looking him straight in the eyes,\r\nsaid with an angelic benignity:\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Stas, whether there is a man in the world to whom I could\r\ngive my treasure and darling with greater confidence?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young couple married and remained in England until Mr. Rawlinson's\r\ndeath and a year later they started upon a long journey. As they\r\npromised to themselves to visit those localities in which they had\r\nspent their earliest years and afterwards at one time had wandered as\r\nchildren, they proceeded first of all to Egypt. The state of the Mahdi\r\nand Abdullahi had already been overthrown, and after its fall England,\r\nas Captain Glenn stated, \"succeeded.\" A railroad was built from Cairo\r\nto Khartûm. The \"sudds,\" or the Nilotic obstructions of growing water\r\nplants, were cleared so that the young couple could in a comfortable\r\nsteamer reach not only Fashoda but the great Lake Victoria Nyanza. From\r\nthe city of Florence lying on the shores of that lake they proceeded by\r\na railroad to Mombasa. Captain Glenn and Doctor Clary had already\r\nremoved to Natal, but in Mombasa there lived under the solicitous care\r\nof the local English authorities the King. The giant at once recognized\r\nhis former master and mistress and particularly greeted Nell with such\r\njoyful trumpeting that the mangrove trees in the neighborhood shook as\r\nif they were swept by the wind. He recognized also old Saba, who\r\noutlived almost two-fold the years usually allotted to a dog and,\r\nthough a trifle blind, accompanied Stas and Nell everywhere.\r\n\r\nHere also Stas learned the Kali enjoyed good health; that under the\r\nEnglish Protectorate he ruled the entire region south of Lake Rudolf,\r\nand that he had introduced missionaries who were spreading Christianity\r\namong the local savage tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this journey the young couple returned to Europe and, with Stas'\r\nvenerable father, settled permanently in Poland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTypographical error silently corrected:\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\nChapter 1: =Stas rose at once= replaced by =Saba rose at once=\r\n\r\nChapter 4: =is n't he wise= replaced by =isn't he wise=\r\n\r\nChapter 5: =is n't it true= replaced by =isn't it true=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's In Desert and Wilderness, by Henryk Sienkiewicz",
