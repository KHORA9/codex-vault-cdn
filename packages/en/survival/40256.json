C., April 10, 1908_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith the manuscript of a technical\r\nbulletin entitled \"Barium, a Cause of the Loco-Weed Disease,\" prepared\r\nby Dr. A. C. Crawford, Pharmacologist, under the direction of Dr. Rodney\r\nH. True, Physiologist in Charge of Poisonous-Plant Investigations, and\r\nto recommend that it be published as Bulletin No. 129 of the series of\r\nthis Bureau.\r\n\r\nFor many years the stockmen in many parts of the West have reported\r\ndisastrous consequences following the eating of so-called loco weeds\r\ncharacteristic of the regions involved. While many have doubted any\r\ncausal relation between the plants in question and the stock losses, the\r\nreality of the damage has remained and has seemed to require a\r\nthoroughgoing sifting of the evidence concerning the part played by the\r\nplants. Accordingly, in the spring of 1905 a station for the\r\nexperimental study of the problem was established at Hugo, Colo., in\r\ncharge of Dr. C. Dwight Marsh, Expert, in cooperation with the Colorado\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station. Later a further feeding experiment was\r\nundertaken at Imperial, Nebr., in cooperation with the Nebraska\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station. Parallel with the feeding work in the\r\nfield, laboratory work, designed to test under laboratory conditions the\r\npoisonous action of the plants from given areas, was undertaken at\r\nWashington by Dr. A. C. Crawford, Pharmacologist. A further phase of his\r\npart of the work was an attempt to ascertain the nature of such\r\npoisonous substance or substances as might occur in the loco plants.\r\n\r\nIn both of these lines of work Doctor Crawford has been successful, and\r\nthe technical results of his work are here collected.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                        B. T. GALLOWAY,\r\n                                                     _Chief of Bureau_.\r\n\r\n  Hon. JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY STATEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA scientific understanding of the so-called loco-weed disease has been\r\ndemanded and sought after for several decades for most practical\r\npurposes, but, in spite of the great amount of attention which this\r\nproblem has received, no general agreement has been found among the\r\nresults obtained. The field investigations have given such contradictory\r\nevidence that until the Bureau of Plant Industry of the Department of\r\nAgriculture turned its attention to the matter the whole subject of the\r\nloco disease was regarded by many as a kind of delusion and the\r\nexistence of a distinct entity was freely doubted. Not only did this\r\nconfusion characterize the field aspect of the matter, but the situation\r\nviewed from the standpoint of laboratory study was also much obscured.\r\nSome investigators claimed to have separated poisonous substances of\r\nvarious sorts from the loco weeds, while others of equal scientific\r\nstanding denied the presence of any poisonous substance in the plants\r\nunder general suspicion--the so-called loco weeds.\r\n\r\nIn view of the great seriousness of the loco situation from the\r\nstandpoint of the stock interests, an active campaign both in the line\r\nof feeding experiments in the field and laboratory study at Washington\r\nwas undertaken by the Office of Poisonous-Plant Investigations of the\r\nBureau of Plant Industry.\r\n\r\nThe feeding experiments carried out at Hugo, Colo., in cooperation with\r\nthe Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station, before the close of the\r\nfirst season developed evidence that there was in reality such a thing\r\nas a loco disease. The investigator in charge was enabled to describe\r\nthe disease in its most important manifestations and made it possible to\r\nsift the facts from the large number of contradictory statements in the\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory work, undertaken and carried on simultaneously, consisted\r\nof a pharmacological study, under laboratory conditions and with the\r\nusual laboratory subjects, of the action of plant material sent in from\r\nthe field. The acute phase of loco-weed poisoning, as well as a more\r\nprolonged type of the disease, was studied. In plants found in this\r\npreliminary feeding to be harmful, the poisonous principle was sought,\r\nwith the very striking results fully described in this paper. The\r\ndemonstration of the presence of barium in the plants was followed by\r\nbarium feeding, with the production of symptoms which agreed with those\r\nproduced in the laboratory with loco extracts and in the field\r\nexperiments with the loco plants as seen growing on the range. By\r\ncomparing these laboratory results with those produced in connection\r\nwith the field work, it became possible to sift the wheat from the chaff\r\nin the mass of contradictory evidence detailed in the literature of this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe practical importance of the discovery of the true nature of the\r\nactive poisonous principle of the loco weeds is very great. It not only\r\nsheds light on the loco situation and enables one to explain many\r\nhitherto inexplicable things, but it also adds much to our knowledge of\r\nbarium in its medical bearings. It opens up most important problems\r\nconcerning the soils and the relation of the flora to them. It should be\r\nborne in mind that although barium is shown to be chiefly responsible\r\nfor the poisonous properties of loco weeds in eastern Colorado, it is\r\nentirely possible that in other regions other substances may be equally\r\nor even more significant. This discovery also seems likely to provide a\r\nbasis for a rational treatment of locoed stock. Unfortunately, the\r\ndiscovery of the fact that barium is the poisonous constituent of loco\r\nweeds came too late to aid in the search for remedial measures on the\r\nrange during the period covered by this report, but those empirically\r\narrived at have received additional support from these laboratory\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThus the work in field and laboratory, undertaken after repeated\r\nattempts and discouraging failures by others, has yielded results to\r\npersistent scientific research and promises practical aid to the now\r\nsuffering live-stock interests. The results of the laboratory work are\r\npresented in this bulletin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RODNEY H.

Some of these animals die in a condition known as\r\n\"locoed,\" a term derived from the Spanish word \"loco,\" meaning foolish\r\nor crazy.\r\n\r\nThis disorder extends from Montana to Texas and Mexico, and from Kansas\r\nand Nebraska to California.[1]\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the United States Department of Agriculture sent out, under the\r\nimmediate direction of Mr. V. K. Chesnut, a request for information\r\nconcerning the ravages of the loco disease. It was found that in the ten\r\nStates of California, Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico,\r\nNorth Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming the loss in 1898 was\r\n$144,850. Of this amount, $117,300 was attributed to Colorado alone; in\r\nfact, the disorder spread so that this State expended more than $200,000\r\nin two years and over $425,000 in a period of nine years in attempts to\r\neradicate the loco plants, the supposed cause of the trouble.[2]\r\n\r\nThe loss in one area of 35 by 120 miles in southwestern Kansas amounted\r\nto 25,000 cattle in 1883.[3] This loss in stock has been so great that\r\nthe raising of horses has of necessity been abandoned in certain areas\r\non account of the prevalence of these loco weeds.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to obtain accurate data, as the ranchmen believe that\r\nany information as to the prevalence of the disorder would interfere\r\nwith the value of their stock.[4]\r\n\r\nDr. James Fletcher, of the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa, Canada,\r\ntestified before the Select Standing Committee on Agriculture and\r\nColonization that he had never seen a case in the North-west of a\r\nCanadian bred animal being locoed, although the loco plants were\r\nprevalent. He explained this absence of loco disease by the abundance of\r\ngrass on the range, because of which the animals do not acquire the\r\nhabit of eating loco plants.[5] Cases have been reported, however, in\r\nManitoba.[6]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [1] Stalker, M.

Experimental Farms Reports for 1892, p. 148.\r\n    1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=PLANTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOCOED CONDITION.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition known as \"locoed\" is popularly believed to be due to\r\neating various plants, especially the members of the Astragalus and\r\nAragallus genera of the Leguminosæ, or pea family, but particularly to\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_ and _Aragallus lamberti_. These plants have\r\ntherefore received the name \"loco plants,\"[7] or crazy weed. But others,\r\nas _Astragalus mortoni_,[8] _A. hornii_, _A. lentiginosus_, _A.\r\npattersoni_,[9] _A. nuttallianus_, _A. missouriensis_, _A. lotifloras_,\r\n_A. bisulcatus_, _A. haydenianus_,[10] _A. tridactylicus_,[11]\r\n_Crotalaria sagittalis_, _Lotus americanus_,[12] _Sophora sericea_,\r\n_Caprioides aureum_, _Aragallus deflexa_,[13] _A. campestris_,[14] _A.\r\nlagopus_,[15] _Malvastrum coccineum_, _Amaranthus graecizans_, and\r\n_Rhamnus lanceolata_, are considered by some as loco plants.[16] In\r\nother places _Stipa vaseyi_, _Leucocrinum montanum_, _Fritillaria\r\npudica_, _Zygadenus elegans_,[17] and even species of Delphinium are\r\nconsidered loco plants, so widely has this name been used.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico the term \"locoed\" embraces a condition due to the action of\r\n_Cannabis sativa_ and various members of the nightshade family. This\r\nterm has been much abused and has been made to embrace many groups of\r\nsymptoms. In fact, if an animal dies while showing more or less stupor\r\nit is said to be locoed.[18] The early Spanish settlers seemed to be\r\nunfamiliar with the disease, or at least of any causative relation\r\nbetween the plant and the disease. The Spanish name for _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_ was \"Garbanzillo,\" from its resemblance to Garbanzo (_Cicer\r\narietinum_), which is used in Spain as a food.[19] The term as applied\r\nto this condition seems to be of comparatively recent origin.[20]\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar condition to the loco in stock is sometimes\r\nattributed by the ranchmen of our Western States to eating various\r\nsages.[21] In Texas the loco disease is known as \"grass staggers.\"[22]\r\n\r\nHayes[23] has described as follows a condition known as grass staggers,\r\nwhich apparently has little resemblance to loco and is supposed to be\r\ndue to eating overripe grass, especially rye.\r\n\r\n     The symptoms, generally, take two or three days to become\r\n     developed. The animal gradually becomes more or less unconscious\r\n     and paralyzed and staggers if forced to walk. Although he may have\r\n     great difficulty in keeping on his legs, he is extremely averse\r\n     from going down and leans for support against any convenient\r\n     object. He breathes in a snoring manner. The mucous membranes are\r\n     tinged with yellow. Convulsions, or spasms, like those of tetanus,\r\n     may come on.\r\n\r\n     Recovery may be expected in cases which are not marked by extreme\r\n     symptoms.\r\n\r\nIf animals are not regularly salted, they visit salt deposits and eat\r\nthe alkalis. This some sheepmen believe to be the cause of the locoed\r\ncondition, but this is disproved by the occurrence of locoed animals in\r\nranges without salt. Others modify this view by claiming that the\r\nvitiation in taste from eating these alkalis leads to a desire for the\r\nloco weeds and thus to the locoed condition.[24]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [5] Fletcher, J.

It is claimed that practically all herbivorous\r\nanimals are liable to the disease, even antelopes being affected.[27]\r\nHogs are said to be unaffected,[28] but definite information is lacking.\r\nCows seem to be less sensitive to this form of intoxication.[29] The\r\ncondition is usually a chronic one, although acute cases are said to\r\noccur at times. The symptoms consist of digestive disturbances,\r\nassociated with emaciation and various symptoms suggesting lesions in\r\nthe nervous system, central or peripheral. The animals lose their\r\nappetite from the first, begin to emaciate, and show symptoms of\r\nmalnutrition and starvation. The head trembles, the gait becomes feeble\r\nand uncertain, the eyes become sunken and have a \"flat, glassy\r\nlook.\"[30] There is a general sluggishness, muscular incoordination, and\r\ndifficulty in motion; finally all control of the limbs is lost and the\r\nanimal is unable to stand; the coat becomes rough and loses its luster,\r\nand, in fact, all the typical symptoms of starvation appear. In some\r\ncases diarrhea is also present.\r\n\r\nAll of Nockolds's animals, however, were constipated and the stools were\r\ncovered with mucus.[31] The dependent portions of the body may swell,\r\nsimply as an expression of the anæmia.[32] Sometimes there are symptoms\r\nindicating acute pain,[33] the animals running about as if affected with\r\ncolic. They may belch and their abdomens swell. Some claim that the\r\nanimals are markedly salivated so that the saliva trickles from their\r\nmouths. In other cases the mouth may be dry.[34] The eyes may be rolled\r\nup so that the whites alone show. In some cases the pupil has been noted\r\nto be dilated, as in atropine poisoning,[35] but Wilcox states that\r\nthey are contracted as after the use of eserine.[36] The temperature of\r\nthe animal falls from 1/2 degree to 1-1/2 degrees F. below normal.[37]\r\nTetanic symptoms may occur,[38] or the muscles of the mouth and tongue\r\nbecoming paralyzed may interfere with mastication. When water is offered\r\nto the animal, it gazes stupidly at it and may not drink for days. One\r\nof the symptoms noted is the loss of power to back properly.[39] Cows\r\nduring the first two or three months of gestation are almost sure to\r\nabort.[40] This is claimed by Knowles, however, to be due to\r\nmalnutrition. As a result of these observations, suggesting some uterine\r\naction, the drug has been proposed as an emmenagogue.[41]\r\n\r\nThe psychical symptoms are shown by errors of judgment. The animal\r\nbecomes dull and spiritless and wanders about half dazed. The mental\r\ndullness passes into stupor. This dull, stupid condition has been\r\ncompared to intoxication with opium. If the locoed horse is led across a\r\nstick lying on the ground he often jumps high as if it were a great\r\nobstacle. The animal may now have maniacal attacks, during which he\r\nrears and may fall backward,[42] and makes unreasonable jumps and other\r\nunexpected movements, thus rendering himself dangerous to man.[43] Other\r\nsymptoms due to disturbances of the central nervous system are\r\nhallucinations of various sorts. Though the optic nerve itself is\r\napparently not affected, the animal will stare at an object for a long\r\ntime without any apparent comprehension of its nature. This disturbance\r\nin the visual function McCullaugh claims to be one of the first symptoms\r\nof this disease. The animal seems to lose all idea of distance, as he\r\nwill butt against an obstruction as if oblivious of its presence. Any\r\nsudden or violent motion made before him may cause him to fall.\r\nAccording to some, the animal loses the sense which guides him in\r\nfinding water. A cow may fail to recognize her calf.[44] There is more\r\nor less loss of control of the limbs[45] and tremors;[46] the feet are\r\nlifted abnormally high when trotting, and, if crowded, the animal falls\r\nheadlong and will jump over little hollows as if they were wide\r\nditches.[47] The horse may shy without apparent cause and kick at\r\nimaginary objects,[48] and, in fact, the reasoning powers seem to be\r\nlost. These attacks are brought on by sudden excitement or when crossing\r\nwater.[49] There may be cutaneous hyperæsthesia.\r\n\r\nThe animals may remain with the herd, but they often wander away.\r\nStalker records the following observations:\r\n\r\n     I have seen a single animal miles away from any other individual of\r\n     the herd, carefully searching as if for some lost object, and when\r\n     a loco plant is found he would devour every morsel of it with the\r\n     greatest relish. As soon as one plant was eaten he would\r\n     immediately go in search of more, apparently oblivious to\r\n     everything but the intoxication afforded by his one favorite\r\n     article of food.[50]\r\n\r\nAll of Nockolds's animals which were locoed were mares more than 6 years\r\nof age.[51]\r\n\r\nAccording to Stalker there is a passive type in which the animal shows\r\nsymptoms only on being disturbed; the animal then becomes unmanageable.\r\nThis happens even with old, well-broken saddle horses.[52]\r\n\r\nThere are few published reports as to the symptoms occurring in sheep\r\nwhich are locoed. Stalker[53] says sheep \"become loco-eaters, grow\r\nstupid, emaciated, and eventually die.\" One of the few descriptions of\r\nthe symptoms is that of Ruedi,[54] in which he claims that the symptoms\r\nin sheep are those comparable to the symptoms of cerebro-spinal\r\nmeningitis except that there is an absence of fever. Ruedi speaks of\r\nsheep \"lying flat on the ground, not able to stand, and not able even to\r\nlift their heads to drink the offered water; the head and the vertebra\r\nin opisthotonus position; the four legs stretched out and stiff;\r\nbreathing was stertorous, pulse slow, abdomen much distended, diarrhea\r\npresent. * * * The heart * * * was very slow and insufficient.\" The\r\nteeth (in sheep) may blacken and fall out.[55]\r\n\r\nIt is mainly the young animals, such as lambs and colts, that are\r\naffected, probably due to the fact that their attention is more easily\r\ndirected to the flower of the loco[56] plants. It is claimed (on slight\r\nevidence) that men have become locoed. The symptoms in them are nausea\r\nand headache.[57]\r\n\r\nSchuchardt[58] has called attention to the resemblance of the symptoms\r\nin locoed animals to those which occur in so-called lathyrism, but most\r\nobservers in this country have especially marked the resemblance of the\r\nsymptoms to those induced by the habitual use of narcotic drugs.[59]\r\n\r\nAs a rule the loco plants are refused by animals save when there is lack\r\nof other food, although at times animals have shown the keenest relish\r\nfor these plants, rejected all other forage, and devoted their whole\r\nattention to searching for the loco plants.[60]\r\n\r\nStalker says that animals not too long addicted to the use of these\r\nplants, if confined, soon lose their taste for them (after two or three\r\nmonths),[61] although old loco eaters do not readily lose the habit.\r\nStalker also says that \"it is to be presumed that the plant is possessed\r\nof some toxic property that has a specific effect on the nervous\r\ncenters, and that these effects have a marked tendency to remain\r\npermanent.\"[62]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental character of the disorder seems to be a progressing\r\nanæmia. The interpretation of psychical symptoms in herbivora, and\r\nespecially on the range, must often be fallacious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [25] Kingsley, B.

When once a\r\nsheep takes to eating this plant it seldom or never fattens, and may be\r\nsaid to be lost to its owner.\" Horses, after eating this herb, \"were\r\nexceptionally difficult to catch, and it was observed how strange they\r\nappeared. Their eyes were staring out of their heads and they were\r\nprancing against trees and stumps. The second day two out of nine died,\r\nand five others had to be left at the camp.\"\r\n\r\nMartin[65] experimentally studied these cases of intoxication and sums\r\nup his work as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. That one can by feeding sheep upon Darling pea reproduce all the\r\n     symptoms which are attributed by pastoralists to this cause.\r\n     Briefly stated these symptoms are: Stupidity, loss of alertness and\r\n     an agonized expression, followed by stiffness and slight staggering\r\n     and frequently trembling of the head or limbs. Later, clumsiness\r\n     and unsteadiness ensue, which slowly advance until the animal often\r\n     falls down. In this stage, the action of the animal in running over\r\n     small obstacles is characteristic. It jumps over a twig as if it\r\n     were a foot in height. When first it commences to tumble about, it\r\n     is able more or less readily to regain its feet, but in the\r\n     advanced stage of the disease this is impossible and, after\r\n     exhausting itself in efforts to do so, it remains lying down until\r\n     it dies. During the whole time the sheep become progressively more\r\n     bloodless, and in advanced cases the blood when shed appears to the\r\n     naked eye lighter in color. It contains fewer red blood-cells\r\n     (about two-thirds to one-half the usual number). (The corpuscles\r\n     were estimated in several cases by means of a hæmocytometer.) All\r\n     these symptoms are much aggravated by driving. Thus, an animal in\r\n     which the symptoms are little marked may exhibit them in a striking\r\n     degree after being driven. In addition to the above the teeth\r\n     (especially in young sheep) frequently become loose, and\r\n     consequently displaced or even dislodged.\r\n\r\n     2. That the time which elapses before the onset of definite\r\n     symptoms is three to four weeks in sheep of 2 to 3 years old. (It\r\n     is probable, however, that with younger animals the time is\r\n     shorter.)\r\n\r\n     3. That under the conditions of the experiment, the animals\r\n     survived about three months. They lived, however, an invalid's\r\n     life. Everything was brought to them, and it is improbable that if\r\n     feeding exclusively upon the pea, and left to shift for themselves\r\n     in the paddocks, they would survive more than two months.\r\n\r\n     4. That if a sheep be returned to proper fodder after one month to\r\n     six weeks feeding upon the pea, and before the symptoms are fully\r\n     established, it may recover completely.\r\n\r\n     5. That when once the paralytic symptoms are established it will\r\n     not recover; but if returned to proper food, will remain in much\r\n     the same condition, becoming neither better nor worse.\r\n\r\n     6. That Darling pea contains a very fair amount of nourishing\r\n     material so that animals may, provided they eat it readily, retain\r\n     their condition on it for some weeks, until the poisonous principle\r\n     contained has had time to exert its effects.\r\n\r\nThese plants, if fed with other herbage, do not seem to be injurious and\r\napparently lose their harmful action upon being cultivated.[66] As long\r\nas salt is properly fed the animals will not eat this plant[67] and are\r\nsaid to suffer no effects from it. Physiological study has shown the\r\npresence of a body with marked sudorific power which causes rapid\r\nemaciation in frogs.[68]\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that these symptoms are due to the presence of a\r\nnarcotic poison in the plant.[69] Post-mortem examinations were negative\r\nsave for the presence of a peripheral neuritis.[70]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [63] Maiden, J.

The peritoneum\r\nmay be found inflamed.[72] The peritoneum and omentum in one case (cow),\r\nreported by Sayre, were covered with small nodules. These were probably\r\ntubercular in origin. The colon in one horse was found enormously\r\ndistended, while the coecum and small intestines were normal,[73] save\r\nthat the walls appeared thin.\r\n\r\nUlcers have been found at times in the kidneys, but were probably\r\nsecondary in origin, as other cases are reported with normal kidneys.\r\nFaville has found in some cases amyloid degeneration. The pancreas and\r\nspleen are reported normal. The abdominal cavity may contain a slight\r\neffusion.[74] The liver has been found cirrhotic, and at times shows\r\ntubercular lesions of a secondary nature. The inner coat of the bladder\r\nhas been found softened, and in sheep the bladder may be markedly\r\ndistended at the autopsy. The cerebral membranes are congested and\r\nperhaps adherent,[75] and there may be blood clots over the longitudinal\r\nsinus or at the base of the brain. Effusions have been especially noted\r\naround the medulla. The arachnoid has also shown slight congestion, and\r\nin other cases the membranes showed a slight thickening. The middle\r\nventricle was found filled with yellow serum, while the fourth ventricle\r\ncontained a hemorrhagic effusion,[76] and the base of the brain was\r\ncovered by a clot. The hemorrhage may become organized and the brain be\r\nheld to the membranes by tough organized fibers. In many cases serous\r\neffusion is present in the lateral ventricles. The arachnoid space is\r\nalso in some cases similarly filled. Microscopic examination of the\r\nbrain in the case of a steer showed atrophy of Purkinjie's cells.[77]\r\n\r\nIn sheep the post-mortem examination showed paleness, anæmia of the\r\nmuscles, and great distention of the abdomen. The intestines were found\r\nfilled with gases, and the mesenteric blood vessels filled with blood.\r\nNo peritonitis, or ascites, or ecchymoses in the mucous membranes were\r\nnoted in the autopsies made on sheep by Ruedi. The liver has been seen\r\nenlarged. In sheep the brain was anæmic. Microscopically the brain\r\nshowed atrophy and the Purkinjie's cells disappeared or their processes\r\natrophied. In these sheep the brain was so anæmic that the distinction\r\nbetween the gray and the white matter was hard to define.[78] The\r\nmembranes of the cord have been found inflamed and adherent, but the\r\nspinal cord was usually normal.[79] In some cases, however, the spinal\r\ncord has been found softened[80] and oedematous. The arteries of the\r\nlimbs were gorged with blood,[81] and at the same time there was a\r\ncollection of serum in the abdominal cavity. Death is thought to be due\r\nto starvation.[82] In other words, the pathological condition, according\r\nto published accounts, shows little that is characteristic save some\r\naction on the gastro-intestinal tract.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [71] Anderson, F.

B. Ormsby, with\r\nthe statement that they were poisonous to stock, especially to horses.\r\nMrs. J. S. Whipple also corroborated this information. The botanist of\r\nthe Department, Dr. George Vasey,[85] published a note and requested\r\nfurther information concerning the plants. These notes were enlarged by\r\na similar contribution by Dr. P. Moffat on _Aragallus lamberti_.[86] The\r\nfollowing year Vasey reported with more fullness, and his description of\r\nthe action of the plants is substantially what we find in most of the\r\nbooks of to-day.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Lemmon[87] noted that _Astragalus mortoni_ was \"a deadly sheep\r\npoison.\" At the same time Rothrock,[88] botanist of the United States\r\nGeographical Survey under Lieutenant Wheeler, described these plants,\r\nand Kellogg,[89] a botanist in California, reported that _Astragalus\r\nmenziesii_ was causing great losses in horses, sheep, and cattle and\r\nclaimed that the stockmen had been familiar with this disorder for at\r\nleast ten or fifteen years. This report of Kellogg was followed by that\r\nof Rothrock[90] in 1877.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 a specimen of _Aragallus lamberti_ was sent from Colorado to\r\nProfessor Prescott, of the University of Michigan, under the name of\r\n\"crazy weed,\" with the statement that it was poisonous to horses and\r\ncattle and that, while the Mexicans often used it in making beer, it\r\nsometimes caused symptoms in men. His pupil, Miss Watson, undertook a\r\nstudy of its chemical properties. She failed to isolate any pure\r\nchemical compound, but claimed that in the root there was a body giving\r\nalkaloidal reactions and that there was also a resinous body present.\r\nAnother of his pupils, W. R. Birdsall, took the ground-up root himself\r\nin doses of 20 grains at various intervals for several days and later\r\n40-grain doses in one and a half hours, but without experiencing any\r\nmarked symptoms except colicky pains. A kitten also was given about one\r\nand a half ounces of the fluid extract without effect. Prescott[91] sums\r\nup by saying that \"it would seem that the dried ground root possesses no\r\npoisonous properties.\" The work of Miss Watson was considered of\r\nsufficient importance to be abstracted in the Annual Report of the\r\nCommissioner of Agriculture for 1878 (1879), page 134.\r\n\r\nGradually the Department of Agriculture became more and more interested\r\nin this subject, and Peter Collier, chief chemist, in 1878, examined the\r\nroots and leaves of _Aragallus lamberti_ for alkaloids, but found\r\nnone.[92]\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Peter Collier published a proximate analysis of _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_ made by Francis A. Wentz, of Kansas. His investigations\r\nshowed it to have an ash content of 6.76 per cent, while the _Aragallus\r\nlamberti_, analyzed by L. F. Dyrenforth, of Chicago, showed an ash\r\ncontent of 4.32 per cent. Collier[93] sums up by saying:\r\n\r\n     From the additional work done at this Department it seems probable\r\n     that the deleterious effects observed from animals eating this\r\n     plant may be due principally to the fact that the sweet taste\r\n     causes cattle to reject more nutritious food and strive to subsist\r\n     upon the Oxytropis only. This plant is mechanically a very unfit\r\n     substance for food, being of a tough, fibrous, and indigestible\r\n     character. It is possible that, when the animal becomes somewhat\r\n     enfeebled by lack of proper nourishment, the small amount of\r\n     alkaloid may have a direct poisonous action. Again, it seems\r\n     probable that the plant may contain much larger proportions of\r\n     alkaloid at certain stages in its development than at others, or\r\n     the seeds may prove to be the most injurious portion.\r\n\r\nThe departmental work was continued by further short notices by\r\nVasey[94] in 1884, 1886, and 1887, and by the report of Stalker in 1887.\r\nThis report by Stalker is still the best description on the clinical\r\nside of the question.\r\n\r\nRothrock,[95] meeting the loco plants in his survey work, describes\r\ntheir effects on animals as follows:\r\n\r\n     Certain it is, however, that, once commenced, they continue it,\r\n     passing through temporary intoxication to a complete nervous and\r\n     muscular wreck in the later stages, when it has developed into a\r\n     fully marked disease which terminates in death from starvation or\r\n     inability to digest a more nourishing food. The animal toward the\r\n     last becomes stupid or wild, or even vicious, or, again, acting as\r\n     though attacked with \"blind staggers.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the name of Crotalaria, H. Gibbons,[96] in 1879, refers to a plant\r\ngrowing in California which it was claimed was producing characteristic\r\nsymptoms of poisoning in horses and sheep. This plant Professor Maisch\r\nafterwards identified as _Aragallus lamberti_.\r\n\r\nDr. Isaac Ott[97] undertook the physiological study of the question and\r\nused an alcoholic extract of _Astragalus mollissimus_. He found from its\r\naction on frogs, rabbits, and cats that the plant had decided\r\nphysiological action, as follows:\r\n\r\n     (1) It decreases the irritability of the motor nerves.\r\n\r\n     (2) Greatly affects the sensory ganglia of the central nervous\r\n         system, preventing them from readily receiving impressions.\r\n\r\n     (3) Has a spinal tetanic action.\r\n\r\n     (4) Kills mainly by arrest of the heart.\r\n\r\n     (5) Increases the salivary secretion.\r\n\r\n     (6) Has a stupefying action on the brain.\r\n\r\n     (7) Reduces the cardiac force and frequency.\r\n\r\n     (8) Temporarily increases arterial tension, but finally decreases\r\n         it.\r\n\r\n     (9) It greatly dilates the pupil.\r\n\r\nDoctor Stockman, in England, about this time tried the action of the\r\naqueous and alcoholic extracts of the dried _Astragalus mollissimus_\r\nsent from Texas. He experimented with frogs and rabbits in increasing\r\ndoses, but without result.[98]\r\n\r\nIn 1888 Hill reported that a species of Astragalus was acting\r\ndetrimentally on cattle, goats, and sheep in Cyprus and that these\r\nanimals fell down as if intoxicated, and also that the natives in time\r\nof great drought feed their cattle with this plant mixed with straw, but\r\nthat they were always made sick until they became used to it.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 Professor Sayre, of the University of Kansas, undertook the\r\ninvestigation of the loco question. His first report was made in the\r\nTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Sciences for 1885, and his reports\r\nhave been continued at various periods up to 1904. The results of his\r\nexperiments on various animals--dogs, cats, and frogs[99]--have been\r\nentirely negative. He administered alcoholic preparations to himself and\r\ntook them until they became too nauseous to continue, and found they\r\nproduced absolutely no symptoms besides the nausea. He suggests,\r\nhowever, that if the plant really is poisonous it is due to its fine\r\nhairs, which might mechanically cause death. Sayre has stated that he\r\nhas sent thousands of pounds of the dried loco plants to various\r\ninvestigators in America and Europe, but all reports were negative as to\r\npharmacological activity. He has, however, done some work on the pure\r\nchemistry of the plant and found that the plant contained 10 per cent of\r\nmoisture and yielded 12.01 per cent of ash. Of this ash, 25 per cent was\r\nsoluble in water, while 50.6 per cent was soluble in HCl. The insoluble\r\nportion consisted largely of silica. He found CaO, K_{2}O, MgO,\r\nAl_{2}O_{3}, and Fe_{2}O_{3}, with the acid radicals SO_{3}, Cl,\r\nP_{2}O_{5}, CO_{2}, and SiO_{2}.[100] Although Sayre claims that the\r\nplant is physiologically inactive, he tried by chemical means to isolate\r\na physiologically active body and, naturally enough under the\r\ncircumstances, failed to find one. He claims that while the plant might\r\ngive alkaloid reactions, he was unable to isolate this body in a pure\r\nstate, and that alfalfa reacted similarly.\r\n\r\nThe investigation on animals was continued by Kennedy.[101] He\r\nadministered an infusion of 1/2 ounce of green _Astragalus mollissimus_\r\nto a fasting dog weighing 23 pounds, but there were no symptoms after 12\r\nhours. A decoction of 1 ounce of the green plant and one of 4 ounces of\r\nthe dried plant were likewise without action. Extracts with hydrochloric\r\nacid were also inactive. When 400 grams of the dried and powdered plant\r\nwere fed in substance the result was merely to increase the appetite.\r\nThe organic acid obtained from 4 ounces of the plant was also found to\r\nbe inert.\r\n\r\nKennedy did not state in what season the plant was collected and from\r\nwhat locality it was obtained, but says simply that the plant extract\r\nwas inactive to a dog, a carnivorous animal, and that therefore the\r\nplant is nonpoisonous. He adds that death might be due to the tough\r\nfibers and indigestible character of the plant. He overlooks, however,\r\nthe fact that the plant might vary in its toxicity, and he infers from\r\nthe experiments on carnivorous animals that these results would hold\r\ngood for herbivora, yet he does not claim that carnivora become locoed\r\nin nature.\r\n\r\nKennedy found that the plant lost 80 per cent in weight on drying and\r\nthat the water extract which represented 30.6 per cent of the powdered\r\nand dried plant contained magnesium sulphate and sodium chlorid, tannic\r\nacid, gum, coloring matter, an extractive, and a \"peculiar organic\r\nacid.\" The ashed plant yielded 20 per cent of ash, consisting of\r\nmagnesium sulphate, sodium chlorid, alumina, silica, and a trace of\r\niron. \"The abundant precipitate produced by the alkaline hydrates,\r\npotassium, sodium, and ammonium was found to consist of magnesium\r\nhydrate, an abundance of this base being present in the plant.\" Kennedy\r\nalso obtained alkaloidal reactions, but failed to isolate the body\r\ngiving these reactions.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the investigations were greatly stimulated by the report of\r\nDoctor Day,[102] then of the University of Michigan. She claimed that\r\nshe was able to produce marked physiological symptoms, using both\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_ and _Aragallus lamberti_ in her work. She\r\nadministered daily 60 to 70 c.c. of a decoction[103] of the plants to\r\nkittens, together with abundant milk and other food. She states that in\r\ntwo days--\r\n\r\n     The kittens became less active, the coat grew rough, appetite for\r\n     ordinary food diminished and fondness for the \"loco\" increased,\r\n     diarrhea came on, and retching and vomiting occasionally occurred.\r\n     The expression became peculiar and characteristic. Emaciation and\r\n     the above symptoms progressively increased until the eighteenth\r\n     day, when periods of convulsive excitement supervened. At times the\r\n     convulsions were tetanic in character; frothing at the mouth and\r\n     throwing the head backward as in opisthotonus were marked. At other\r\n     times the kitten would stand on its hind legs and strike the air\r\n     with its forepaws, then fall backward and throw itself from side to\r\n     side. These periods of excitement were followed by perfect quiet,\r\n     the only apparent sign of life being the respiratory movements.\r\n     After a short interval of quiet the convulsive movements would\r\n     recur. These alternate periods of excitement and quiet lasted\r\n     thirty-six hours, when the posterior extremities became paralyzed,\r\n     and the kitten died about two hours afterward. There was no\r\n     apparent loss of consciousness before death.\r\n\r\n     The post-mortem examination revealed the presence of ulcers in the\r\n     stomach and duodenum. Some of the ulcers had nearly perforated the\r\n     walls of the stomach and duodenum. The heart was in diastole; brain\r\n     and myel appeared normal. As might be expected from the emaciated\r\n     condition, the entire body was anæmic.\r\n\r\n     In a second case 60 to 70 cubic centimeters of a more concentrated\r\n     decoction were fed daily, with other food as before, to a vigorous\r\n     adult cat. The symptoms of inactivity, loss of appetite, rough\r\n     coat, diarrhea, and the peculiar expression of countenance were as\r\n     in the first case. By the twelfth day the cat was wasted almost to\r\n     a skeleton, and was correspondingly weak. Paralysis of the hind\r\n     limbs came on, and the cat died on the thirteenth day. There were\r\n     no periods of excitement in this case.\r\n\r\nThese cats developed a craving for the decoction and \"would beg for it\r\nas an ordinary kitten does for milk, and when supplied would lie down\r\ncontented.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Day made controls with healthy animals under the same conditions,\r\nwith the exception that they received no loco plant. She also fed a\r\nyoung wild jack rabbit on milk and grass for a few days and then\r\nsubstituted fresh loco plants for grass.\r\n\r\n     At first the \"loco\" was refused, but after two or three days the\r\n     \"loco\" was eaten with as much relish as the grass had been. After\r\n     ten days of the milk and \"loco\" diet the rabbit was found dead,\r\n     with the head thrown back and the stomach ruptured.\r\n\r\n     Subcutaneous injections of the concentrated decoction caused\r\n     nervous twitchings in frogs and kittens, and if large amounts were\r\n     used death followed in from one to two hours from paralysis of the\r\n     heart. The same symptoms were produced in frogs by the injection of\r\n     an alcoholic extract of the residue left after the evaporation to\r\n     dryness of the decoction.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Doctor Day was able to produce a chronic form of loco\r\npoisoning with the characteristic symptoms so often described save in\r\nthe occurrence of diarrhea. Diarrhea is not usually noted on the range.\r\nSayre had already reported an ulcerated condition of the intestines of a\r\nlocoed cow similar to that described by Doctor Day as occurring in cats.\r\nDoctor Day urged that the reason previous experimenters failed to\r\nproduce symptoms was that they had used too small an amount of the plant\r\nand that by systematic feeding to healthy cats cases of loco disease may\r\nbe produced.\r\n\r\nStorke states that \"Dr. V. C. Vaughan, of the University of Michigan,\r\nhas since fully corroborated Dr. Day's views.\"[104]\r\n\r\nIn her experiments Doctor Day used the leaves, roots, and stems of the\r\nplants gathered in September. She believed that the greatest amount of\r\npoison is present in autumn and winter. She later undertook the\r\nisolation of the active principle, and proceeded as follows:[105]\r\n\r\n     The roots, stems, and leaves were boiled ten hours, strained, and\r\n     the decoction concentrated to a sirup, poured, while hot, into a\r\n     hot flask, corked and set away. At the end of ten days the sirup\r\n     had separated into two layers--the upper a blackish liquid, the\r\n     lower a brownish sediment. The liquid was poured into a flask and\r\n     covered with six times its volume of very dilute alcohol, 30 per\r\n     cent (the sediment also was washed with dilute alcohol, to insure a\r\n     complete removal of the liquid), corked, and let stand three days;\r\n     agitated occasionally, then filtered, and the filtrate slowly\r\n     evaporated in the air, when crystals were formed. It was found\r\n     important not to hurry the evaporation, for when this took place\r\n     too rapidly the crystals did not form.\r\n\r\n     These crystals are microscopic in size, blue-white in color, and of\r\n     a variety of forms. The most characteristic are slender and\r\n     pointed, arranged in rosettes or grouped in various ways. They are\r\n     soluble in distilled water and very dilute alcohol, very sparingly\r\n     soluble in strong alcohol, not soluble in chloroform or ether.\r\n\r\n     The evaporated mass containing the crystals, when dissolved in\r\n     distilled water, is slightly acid in reaction. A small amount of\r\n     this fed to a kitten produced the train of characteristic toxic\r\n     symptoms--sleepiness, loss of appetite, retching, and\r\n     diarrhea--that is produced by quite large amounts of the decoction.\r\n\r\nThe crystals Sayre[106] claims to have already seen. He says that they\r\ngave no precipitate with Mayer's reagent, platinum chlorid, or with\r\nammonia, but that barium chlorid and ammonium oxalate gave a\r\nprecipitate, and he believes that they were in reality an inorganic\r\ncombination of calcium, so that while Doctor Day may have obtained an\r\nextract which produced characteristic symptoms she certainly has not\r\nisolated any pure active principle. Later she admitted that it was not\r\npossible \"to make positive statements as to the chemical character of\r\nthe active principle.\"[107]\r\n\r\nIn 1884 there was a fatal outbreak of a disorder in horses in portions\r\nof the Missouri Valley in Iowa, Nebraska, and Dakota. This was almost\r\nuniformly fatal in a few weeks or months. The animals lost strength and\r\nbecame emaciated, although they were kept in pasture where there was\r\nabundant grass. There was marked stupor, the animals falling asleep\r\nwhile eating, and they \"would remain standing for a whole week, sleeping\r\nmuch of the time, with the head resting upon some object.\" The\r\npost-mortem examination showed that \"in every instance there was marked\r\nhemorrhagic effusion into the fourth ventricle, the liver and spleen\r\nwere abnormally dense, the walls of the intestines were almost destitute\r\nof blood, and the stomach enormously distended with undigested food.\"\r\nThe post-mortem find and clinical symptoms suggested to Stalker[108]\r\nthat this disorder was due to some plant analogous to _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_. He found abundant in these regions _Crotalaria\r\nsagittalis_, or rattle-box, one of the so-called loco weeds, and by the\r\nadministration per os to a young horse of an infusion of 15 pounds of\r\nthe plant, given in two days, produced the clinical symptoms and the\r\npost-mortem condition of the brain which he previously observed on the\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nPower and Cambier[109] undertook the chemical study and the isolation of\r\nthe active principle of this plant, together with that of _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_. They found that the _Astragalus mollissimus_ if distilled\r\nwith water yielded a distillate which possessed a peculiar odor, which\r\nthey thought due to a trace of volatile oil. On distilling with alkali\r\nthey obtained ammonia and a trace of trimethylamine. In the case of\r\nCrotalaria only ammonia was found.[110] They argued that because\r\ntrimethylamine was not obtained in this case choline was not present. On\r\ndistilling the _Astragalus mollissimus_ with acidulated water\r\n(H_{2}SO_{4}) the distillate was found to contain acetic acid--settling\r\nthe nature of the \"peculiar organic acid\" described by Kennedy. From\r\nthis plant they obtained a resin or mixture of resinous bodies by\r\nextracting the plant with alcohol, and after concentration precipitating\r\nwith acid water. These resins in doses of from 2 to 5 grains failed to\r\nproduce any symptoms in kittens.\r\n\r\nAn albuminoid which was obtained by precipitating a concentrated aqueous\r\nextract of _Astragalus mollissimus_ by means of alcohol likewise was\r\nfound to be inactive to a kitten in doses corresponding to 50 grams of\r\nthe crude plant. A globulin which was isolated by precipitation from a\r\n10 per cent sodium chlorid solution proved also to be inactive in doses\r\nof 0.2 gram. They then extracted 3 kilograms of these plants with 1/2\r\nper cent sulphuric acid, and after evaporation to a thick gum the mass\r\nwas extracted with strong alcohol, the alcoholic solution was\r\nevaporated, and the alcoholic residue taken up in water and precipitated\r\nby neutral and basic lead acetates, and after removing the lead with\r\nsulphureted hydrogen the filtrate gave precipitates with various\r\nalkaloidal reagents. The sirupy residue which they obtained from\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_ by decomposing the precipitate with Mayer's\r\nsolution administered to kittens in doses of 0.1 gram produced merely\r\nfrothing at the mouth with profuse flow of saliva, but the animals soon\r\nrecovered. The presence of a large amount of calcium was shown but not\r\nestimated quantitatively.\r\n\r\nPower and Cambier summed up their conclusions by stating that both the\r\nAstragalus and the Crotalaria contain very small amounts of toxic\r\nalkaloids, to which they believe the symptoms of poisoning produced were\r\ndue. Their work from a chemical standpoint is excellent, but from a\r\npharmacological point of view seems to be deficient; in fact, Power does\r\nnot claim to be a pharmacologist. What would seem to be the proper\r\ncourse would have been to test for themselves the action of the plant\r\non various animals and, after deciding which reacted most\r\ncharacteristically, test, after various precipitations, both the\r\nprecipitates and filtrates on various animals to see whether the\r\noriginal symptoms and pathological lesions could be produced. They\r\nfailed, however, to test their mother substance. It is well recognized\r\nthat plants grown under varying conditions and on different soils vary\r\nin the amount of the physiologically active principle they contain.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Crotalaria, Power and Cambier had before them the\r\nexperiment of Stalker, in which he reproduced the disorder by feeding\r\nthe plant extract to horses, yet they claimed that the body which they\r\nadministered was the active principle, merely because it produced some\r\nfrothing at the mouth and salivation in a kitten. The percentage of\r\nactive principle they found would be too small to account for the\r\nsymptoms, except in the case of a very active compound.\r\n\r\nCertain of these precipitates were also later examined physiologically\r\nby O'Brine.[111] He also found the resin precipitated from an alcoholic\r\nextract of the plant and also the alcoholic extract from 2.2 pounds of\r\nthe dried _Astragalus mollissimus_ to be physiologically inactive.\r\n\r\nOatman,[112] using Power and Cambier's method with alfalfa (_Medicago\r\nsativa_), obtained a noncrystalline mass which when given in 0.1 gram\r\ndose caused frothing at the mouth in a kitten, but no serious symptoms.\r\nThis 0.1 gram represented about 5 pounds of powdered leaves and tops of\r\nthe plants.\r\n\r\nSince the appearance of Power and Cambier's work Sayre has published\r\nvarious papers on the loco weeds in the Transactions of the Kansas\r\nAcademy of Sciences for 1903-4, vol. 19, p. 194, 1905; 1901-2, vol. 18,\r\np. 141; Seventh Biennial Report of the State Board of Agriculture of\r\nKansas, vol. 12, p. 97, 1891; Journal of the Kansas Medical Society,\r\nvol. 4, pp. 222 and 241, 1904, etc. He has contributed nothing\r\nespecially new, but says that \"the old theory that an alkaloidal poison\r\nis secreted in the plant causing the loco trouble has not been found\r\ntenable,\" but wishes to be understood that he does not discredit the\r\nground for the opinion that in some mysterious way certain disorders\r\noccur in cattle in connection with what is commonly called loco-weed. He\r\nsuggests that this connection might be somewhat similar to the\r\nrelationship between the disorder caused by over-feeding half-starved\r\nanimals on clover or alfalfa[113] and has had the plant analyzed as to\r\nits nutritive value, giving the table in the Transactions of the Kansas\r\nAcademy of Sciences, vol. 19, p. 194. He makes the suggestion that any\r\ninjurious action the plants may have might be due to the fine, hair-like\r\nprojections on the plant which mechanically set up irritation. This\r\nsupposition can be thrown out at once by the experiment of Day and\r\nothers, who induced symptoms in animals by extracts of the plant, and by\r\nthe fact that other coarse plants do not act similarly. This fine,\r\nhair-like material was found to constitute about 33 per cent of the\r\nplant on grinding. But Sayre himself does not seem to be positive as to\r\nany conclusion. He, like O'Brine and others, has obtained alkaloidal\r\nreactions from the plant, but states he has obtained similar ones from\r\nalfalfa.[114] At one time he said:\r\n\r\n     I do not consider loco directly or indirectly the cause of the\r\n     condition, but am of the opinion that what is called \"locoed\" is,\r\n     first, congestion of the brain and spinal marrow (causing blindness\r\n     and first symptoms), and, second, softening to a greater or less\r\n     extent.[115] These terms describing the alleged symptoms of\r\n     \"locoism\" might occur in well recognized diseases resulting from\r\n     brain lesions, which latter occur in so-called forage poisoning and\r\n     poisoning from foul drinking water, etc.\r\n\r\n     We are not prepared to affirm or deny that the loco-weed produces a\r\n     train of symptoms characteristic of the plant.[116]\r\n\r\nAgain Sayre states:\r\n\r\n     It seems not unreasonable to suppose that the peculiar condition of\r\n     the animals of the plains, when they gorge themselves with this\r\n     highly nitrogenous weed, has something to do with the disease. A\r\n     condition of malnutrition may set in and give rise to the rapid\r\n     growth of a toxic-producing micro-organism or an irritating\r\n     principle. This principle may be capable of cultivation and of\r\n     producing disease artificially. Be this as it may, we feel\r\n     warranted in saying that the so-called poison is a development\r\n     within the animal, not a product preexisting in the weed itself.\r\n\r\nSayre also suggests the possibility of the plants producing hydro-cyanic\r\nacid, which, it is well known, occurs in sorghum.[117] In the Journal of\r\nthe Kansas Medical Society (vol. 4, p. 243), he claims to have isolated\r\na crystalline body, but this he has not tested physiologically. Sayre\r\nespecially deserves credit for keeping the loco investigation alive, and\r\nno doubt his change in position is due to his lack of facilities for\r\npharmacological testing.\r\n\r\nCarl Ruedi[11] fed rabbits daily by a stomach tube with 10 c.c. of an\r\nextract (unstated strength) of _Astragalus mollissimus_ and recorded the\r\nfollowing results:\r\n\r\n     After only five injections one of the rabbits died, and the\r\n     post-mortem showed to a nicety the congestion of the whole tract of\r\n     the vena portæ and the anæmia of the brain. I put six rabbits under\r\n     the influence of loco, and the effect was marked, but not rapid, if\r\n     not given in very concentrated solutions. The solutions were\r\n     prepared differently, and each of the rabbits had its own\r\n     preparation, but the effect was nearly the same. In the beginning\r\n     loco acts as a stimulant; the animals get lively, hilarious,\r\n     running about; cleaning themselves, etc. This lasts about eight\r\n     hours, then they become very quiet, sit in a corner of a box, and\r\n     one can do with them pretty nearly what one likes; they do not move\r\n     from the place, or just run into another corner, to fall back into\r\n     the same complacent reverie. One can leave the door open and hammer\r\n     away at the box, but they do not show any inclination to run away.\r\n     During the excitement, however, they become fierce, and I had once\r\n     the opportunity to watch one of the drollest things possible: One\r\n     of the rabbits, two hours after dosing it, got loose and ran under\r\n     a porch. A heavy tomcat came near this hole, and commenced sniffing\r\n     about; this offended the rabbit highly, and it jumped on the neck\r\n     of the cat, bit it through the skin, and the cat ran screaming\r\n     away. When the animals are first under the influence of moderate\r\n     doses of loco, they suffer greatly from hyperæsthesia of the\r\n     cutaneous nerves; when one touches them with a stick while lying in\r\n     a corner, without hurting them, one sees the platysma working away\r\n     very forcibly, and sometimes they utter sounds of pain. According\r\n     to my experiments the loco-weed works slowly but surely; as soon as\r\n     the anæmia of the brain sets in, the animals act in every respect\r\n     mad like; one hour they are excitable, and then again dull and\r\n     languid as can be. The rabbits eat, when well, very quickly, and\r\n     whenever they have opportunity; not so the locoed rabbit; he eats\r\n     slowly for a minute or two, then he goes into a corner and\r\n     meditates, comes forward to nibble at a carrot or a piece of\r\n     cabbage, but he never eats greedily, and does not steal it from the\r\n     mouth of his neighbor, or only very exceptionally. I observed these\r\n     rabbits for ten days; they did not die, because I gave them weaker\r\n     solutions; but they all became very ill, and as I had to leave the\r\n     park I killed them with the needle inserted into the medulla\r\n     oblongata, and made the post-mortem. In all of these cases I found\r\n     great congestion in the abdomen, and marked anæmia of the brain.\r\n     The congestion of the vena portæ commences certainly very early,\r\n     but still the first symptoms are the nervous symptoms, first as\r\n     excitants, then depressing or sedative, with a marked hyperæsthesia\r\n     of the cutaneous nerves.\r\n\r\nRuedi made an attempt to isolate the active principle and separated a\r\nbase, which he calls \"locoin,\" from an ether shaking. This base,\r\nhowever, he found to be physiologically inactive, but believes the\r\nactivity to be due to a body which he calls \"loco-acid,\" which is\r\npresent in the mother liquid after the shaking with ether. He, however,\r\nhas not obtained this in any degree of purity and gives no chemical data\r\nto substantiate this statement save that the fluid was acid.\r\n\r\nExperiments made at the University of Pennsylvania with certain loco\r\nplants on cats, dogs, and rabbits proved negative.[119]\r\n\r\nOther experiments on rabbits have been made by Doctor Lewis. These\r\nrabbits were fed on the leaves, stem, and whole plant, and also extracts\r\nof one of the loco plants (presumably _Astragalus mollissimus_) for one\r\nor two months, without producing any noticeable effect.[120]\r\n\r\nThis uncertainty in the results of the investigation as to the cause of\r\nthe loco disease turned the attention of observers into other lines.\r\nPresident Ingersoll,[121] of the State Agricultural College of Colorado,\r\nin his autopsies on sheep was struck by the presence of tapeworms\r\n(_Taenia expansa_) in the gall duct and small intestines. He apparently\r\ntried to prove a relationship between the tapeworms and the locoed\r\ncondition by feeding the extract of a loco plant to sheep, and thus\r\nshowing its harmlessness. He prepared a decoction from 20 pounds of loco\r\nplant (the species was not stated) and boiled this down from 12 gallons\r\nto 1 quart. This concentrated extract was fed in three days to a\r\nbottle-fed lamb; this lamb showed no symptoms, although kept under\r\nobservation for two weeks. This theory of the causation of loco by worms\r\nwas also considered by Curtice,[122] and later brought forward by\r\nSteele[123] and Marshall.[124] This idea is very suggestive when\r\nconsidered in relation to the etiology of bothriocephalous anæmia.[125]\r\n\r\nOthers, again, have claimed that the disease is due to a parasite found\r\nupon the loco plants, but all specimens examined by entomologists proved\r\nto be harmless.[126]\r\n\r\nLloyd, from his study of the subject, says:\r\n\r\n     From first to last I have failed in obtaining a characteristic\r\n     proximate principle, either from the fresh or dried plant. The\r\n     disease called loco was as murky as the milk sickness so prevalent\r\n     in the new settlements of Indiana and Kentucky in early days, and,\r\n     like the numberless herbs that have been presumed to produce that\r\n     obscure peculiar disease, milk sickness, loco was unresponsive to\r\n     my chemistry.[127]\r\n\r\n     It may be safely said that if a specimen of the plant were to be\r\n     examined in the ordinary manner by a chemist who had no idea of its\r\n     importance he would report that it did not contain a characteristic\r\n     proximate constituent.[128]\r\n\r\n     Can it be that an admixture of loco and some undetermined plant or\r\n     earth infected with bacteria taken with the roots, each innocuous\r\n     under other conditions, can by digestion together in the stomach\r\n     and intestines result in the production of a poison?[129]\r\n\r\n     To sum up, it seems to the writer that the poison of loco is a\r\n     product, and not an educt.[130]\r\n\r\nBut Lloyd adds, in speaking of the reports of various experts and\r\nranchmen:\r\n\r\n     Their description concerning its toxic action on animals agreed,\r\n     and it was folly to argue that so many observers from so many\r\n     sections of the country could be misled. There must be an\r\n     undetermined something behind the loco-weed.[131]\r\n\r\nIn 1893 O'Brine, from Colorado, and Mayo, from Kansas, reported on their\r\nwork with the loco plants. O'Brine failed to isolate any alkaloidal or\r\nother poisonous body, and his feeding experiments on himself and on\r\nrabbits having failed, he sums up in despair: \"The more I examine the\r\nloco question, the more I am persuaded that we must look for some other\r\ncause besides the loco-weed.\"[132] At the end of his report he gives\r\nsome ash analyses but fails to interpret them. He also fails to give\r\ndetails as to the method of obtaining and estimating his ash. O'Brine's\r\nash analyses are as follows:\r\n\r\n  KEY TO ASH ANALYSIS:\r\n   A = SiO_{2}.\r\n   B = Fe_{2}O_{3} and Al_{2}O_{3}.\r\n   C = CaO.\r\n   D = MgO.\r\n   E = K_{2}O.\r\n   F = Na_{2}O.\r\n   G = H_{2}SO_{4}\r\n   H = Cl.\r\n   I = P_{2}O_{5}.\r\n   J = CO_{2}\r\n\r\n  ------+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+-----+----+----+----+----+-----+\r\n  Plant.|Total|     |     |     |    |     |    |    |    |    |     |\r\n        |ash. |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D |  E  |  F |  G |  H | I  |  J  |\r\n  ------+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+-----+----+----+----+----+-----+\r\n    AM  |12.15|32.77|16.26| 6.05|3.11|13.30|3.21|3.9 |0.47|6.12|10.55|\r\n        |     |     |     |     |    |     |    |    |    |    |     |\r\n    AL  |13.52|17.08|12.21|14.27|2.62|17.26|5.75|3.22|3.87|3.30|17.37|\r\n        |     |     |     |     |    |     |    |    |    |    |     |\r\n    AC  |12.36| 7.82| 5.97|12.10|3.55|23.35|3.38|5.56|9.0 |4.67|20.62|\r\n        |     |     |     |     |    |     |    |    |    |    |     |\r\n  ------+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+-----+----+----+----+----+-----+\r\n  KEY TO PLANTS:\r\n   AM = _Astragalus mollissimus_ (whole plant)\r\n   AL = _Aragallus lamberti_ (whole plant)\r\n   AS = _Astragalus caryocarpus_\r\n\r\nThese analyses are evidently incorrect, as O'Brine estimates a carbon\r\ncontent of 4.13 per cent for the first, and for the second 2.22 per\r\ncent, showing incomplete combustion.\r\n\r\nMayo[133] experimented with alcoholic and aqueous extracts of dried\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_ on guinea pigs, with negative results, and was\r\nfirst led to deny a relationship between the disease and the plants.\r\nLater, as a result of the post-mortem findings, he was convinced that\r\nhis first conclusion was wrong and that \"the disease is certainly the\r\nresult of animals feeding upon the loco-weed.\" Mayo says:\r\n\r\n     A careful survey of the experiments performed and observations\r\n     noted leads me to the opinion that the disease known as \"loco\" is\r\n     the result of malnutrition, or a gradual starvation, caused by the\r\n     animals eating the plants known as \"loco weeds,\" either _Astragalus\r\n     mollissimus_ or _Aragallus lamberti_. If there is a narcotic\r\n     principle in the plant, chemists have failed to find it and a fluid\r\n     extract does not possess it, and a ton of the plant eaten by an\r\n     animal ought to contain enough of the poisonous properties to\r\n     destroy an animal.\r\n\r\nKobert[134] has also tested the activity of _Astragalus mollissimus_ and\r\nsays, \"Ich fand _Astragalus mollissimus_ ziemlich unwirksam.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor McEackran[135] fed dried _Astragalus mollissimus_ and _Aragallus\r\nlamberti_ mixed with feed to a stabled animal for two months without\r\nresult. (Animal not stated).[136] Similar negative experiments are\r\nreported from the State of Washington, but the amounts used were too\r\nsmall to form any conclusions.[137]\r\n\r\nMr. V. K. Chesnut[138] has busied himself with the loco problem, but\r\nmainly in an executive capacity, his own efforts being directed to the\r\nstudy of the relation of the loco plants to the disease on the range. He\r\nhas done no laboratory work. Chesnut and Wilcox made numerous autopsies\r\non sheep and experiments on animals. They claimed that an extract of\r\n_Aragallus spicatus_ produced some slight narcotic action in rabbits.\r\nTheir pathological examinations failed to show any characteristic\r\nlesion, but they state that the cerebral membranes were in all cases\r\nslightly congested. They deny any causative relationship to the presence\r\nof worms or with feeding upon alkalis. They believe that sheep are more\r\nlikely to become locoed if not salted regularly. Chesnut describes one\r\ncase in which a lamb became locoed by nursing from a locoed mother.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Reid Hunt, at that time a special agent of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, studied the loco question in Montana, working\r\nmainly with _Aragallus spicatus_. He moistened the ground-up plant with\r\n93 per cent ethyl alcohol and then percolated it until exhausted. This\r\nextract was evaporated and taken up with water so that 1 c.c. of the\r\nsolution corresponded to 10 grams of the plant. This was fed to an\r\nactive young rabbit weighing 490 grams, 6 c.c. being fed by the mouth\r\nand followed in about an hour by 10 c.c. more, and two hours after this\r\nby 15 c.c. This rabbit showed no symptoms during the following day. The\r\nnext day it was very dull and there was marked muscular weakness, as the\r\nrabbit's legs were spread wide apart and his nose rested on the ground.\r\nLater respiration became very slow and the pupils were dilated. The\r\nparalytic symptoms increased and finally, after a convulsive movement,\r\nthe animal died, thirty-six hours after the first feeding. Hunt merely\r\nstates of the post-mortem examination that the stomach was well filled\r\nand that the \"walls seem normal.\"\r\n\r\nHunt tried to isolate an active principle by the Dragendorff method, but\r\nfailed to obtain any physiologically active shakings. He tried\r\nhypodermic injections of 80 per cent alcohol extractions of the fresh\r\ngreen plant, and after the injection of an extract corresponding to 60\r\ngrams of the fresh plant there was no effect produced. He tried to\r\ninduce symptoms by feeding the plant itself to rabbits, but was\r\nunsuccessful, as the rabbits refused to eat the plant. He was not able\r\nto induce symptoms with the extracts of the dried plant.[139]\r\n\r\nMarshall[140] studied the loco question with regard to sheep and\r\npractically denies the existence of a locoed condition due to eating the\r\nloco plants, but believes the condition due to bad feeding, parasitism,\r\netc. He lays great stress upon the presence of worms, but fails to see\r\nthat they may be merely a secondary infection superimposed upon an\r\nalready morbid condition produced by eating the plants. Others have\r\nclaimed that the cause is an insect living upon the loco plants. Others,\r\nagain, have suggested an analogy with trypanosome disorders.\r\n\r\nChesnut has held the view that many of the cases of so-called locoed\r\nsheep were really due to parasites, but that there was a true locoed\r\ncondition due to eating the loco weeds.\r\n\r\nThe lack of agreement in the results of the investigators has caused\r\nmany to doubt any positive relation between the plant and the disease,\r\nand even as late as 1904 Payne[141] practically says these diseases are\r\ndue to lack of nutrition and not to the loco plant. The matter has been\r\nsummed up in a recent work as follows:\r\n\r\n     Though many chemists have sought for the constituents, none have\r\n     been able to locate the active properties, the trace of alkaloids,\r\n     resins, volatile and fixed oils having each in turn been found\r\n     destitute of it. Yet the poisonous properties are fully established\r\n     by field observations. The destructiveness of these plants to stock\r\n     is so great as to have probably caused upward of a million dollars\r\n     loss in the aggregate, and large bounties have been offered by\r\n     State governments for an effective method of avoiding such losses.\r\n     It is considered very probable that the poisonous constituent is\r\n     albuminoidal.[142]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [83] Storke, B.

Frankforter,[143] from experiments on\r\nhimself, however, denies this.\r\n\r\n_Astragalus glycophyllus_ has been used as a diuretic and _Astragalus\r\nexscapus_ in the treatment of syphilis.[144] \"The seed of _A. boeticus_,\r\nplanted in Germany and England, are found to be the very best substitute\r\nfor coffee yet tried, and so used--roasted, parched, and mixed with\r\ncoffee.\"[145] _Astragalus nuttallianus_, according to Smith,[146] is a\r\nhighly nutritious forage plant in spring. _Astragalus crassicarpus_ has\r\nbeen prophesied by him to be a valuable addition to early spring soiling\r\ncrops. _Astragalus adsurgens_ (_nitidus_) and one or two other species\r\nof Astragalus are still used in Chinese medicine.[147] The Indians of\r\nthe Southwest are familiar with certain loco plants.[148] The Tewans of\r\nHano are said to eat the root of _Aragallus lamberti_, and _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_ is applied locally for headaches by some of the Arizona\r\nIndians. One of these species is used as a flavoring material by the\r\nCoahuillas and is mixed with other plants as spices.[149] _Astragalus\r\nkentrophyta_ had a reputation among the Navajos for the treatment of\r\nrabies.[150] The use of certain loco plants--_Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_--has been advocated on theoretical grounds in the treatment\r\nof certain forms of insanity, but without favorable results.[151] In\r\nPeru and Chile _Astragalus garbancillo_, _A. unifultus_, and _A.\r\nochroleucus_ have been considered injurious to animals.[152] _Astragalus\r\nglyciphyllus_ and _A. alpinus_ have been used in Europe as food for\r\nstock.[153]\r\n\r\nDetails as to the use of other Astragali can be found in Planchon, G.,\r\nSur les Astragales, in Journal de Pharmacie et de Chimie, 5th series,\r\nvol 24, p. 473, 1891; 5th series, vol. 25, pp. 169, 233, 1892.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [143] Frankforter, G.

The\r\nanimal finally selected was the rabbit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=EXPERIMENTS ON RABBITS.=\r\n\r\n\r\n=ACUTE CASES.=\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 1._--On September 8, 1905, an aqueous extract of 333\r\ngrams of fresh _Astragalus mollissimus_, made in Hugo, Colo., and\r\nshipped preserved in chloroform,[154] killed a rabbit weighing 1,616\r\ngrams in one hour and thirty-five minutes, while an extract\r\ncorresponding to 167 grams merely caused drowsiness and loss of appetite\r\nin a rabbit weighing 765 grams.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 2._--On November 29, 1905, a rabbit weighing 1,162.3\r\ngrams was fed with a concentrated aqueous extract of 500 grams of fresh\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_, which had been shipped from Hugo, Colo.,\r\npreserved in chloroform in sealed vessels. This animal died in one hour\r\nand ten minutes. The symptoms consisted in dullness, rapid respiration,\r\nand signs of pain. At autopsy the stomach and upper part of the small\r\nintestines showed hemorrhagic ecchymoses, with dilation of the dural\r\nvessels of the brain and cord, with a clot over a portion of the spinal\r\ncord.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 3._--On February 13, 1906, a rabbit weighing 992 grams\r\nwas fed with a concentrated aqueous extract of 500 grams of the fresh\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_, collected in September and preserved in\r\nchloroform water. Before feeding, the rabbit's ears were warm and the\r\nrabbit struggled when any attempt was made to turn him on his back. The\r\ntemperature at 10.50 a.m., the time of feeding, was 103.5°F.; at 11.15\r\na.m., 102.5°F. At 11.30 a.m. the rabbit was breathing very rapidly\r\nand would stay on his back for some time if placed so. The temperature\r\nat this time was 102.6°F. Both pupils, the one exposed to the light and\r\nthe one protected, were contracted. At 12.02 p.m. convulsive movements\r\nof the legs appeared. The rabbit made one leap, the temperature rose to\r\n103.6°F., and after a few convulsive movements of the limbs the anus\r\nrelaxed and a small stool appeared, the pupils dilated, and the animal\r\ndied at 12.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 4._--The feeding of the extract of 464 grams induced a\r\nfall in temperature of 2.4°F. in three hours, and the rabbit died\r\nseveral hours later (at night).\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 5._--March 2, 1906, a rabbit weighing 928 grams was fed\r\nwith a concentrated extract of 500 grams of the fresh seeds and pods of\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_, made in September, 1905, and preserved with\r\nchloroform water. This animal died in one hour and seven minutes. The\r\nanimal showed the usual post-mortem conditions.\r\n\r\nIt was thus found that the aqueous extract of 500 grams of the fresh\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_ would cause death in about one hour in rabbits\r\nweighing about 2 pounds (907 grams), these rabbits showing constant\r\nclinical symptoms--urination, paralysis, more or less convulsive\r\nmuscular twitchings, often terminating in general convulsions,\r\ndrowsiness, and stupor, with more or less anesthesia. The pupils at the\r\ntime of death were often unequal. At first there was usually a slight\r\nrise in temperature, but this was soon succeeded by a fall. Often there\r\nwere soft stools. The post-mortem lesions in these cases were marked\r\ncongestion, with hemorrhages in the stomach walls and a secretion of\r\nthick mucus. The portions of the stomach walls most affected were the\r\ndependent portions near the cardiac end. The intestines showed\r\ndilatation of the blood vessels. The mesenteric vessels and also the\r\nvessels in the cerebral portions of the dura were markedly dilated; in\r\nsome cases there were clots, especially at the posterior portion of the\r\nbrain, between the cerebrum and the cerebellum. At times there were\r\nclots over the dorsal portion of the cord. On cutting into the brain the\r\nbrain substance itself did not appear to be congested. The cord seemed\r\nabout normal, but the vessels of its membranes were well marked. The\r\nother organs showed nothing characteristic macroscopically. These\r\nexperiments were repeated many times and found to be constant.\r\n\r\nThese acute symptoms were likewise produced by an extract of 500 grams\r\nof the fresh _Aragallus lamberti_ from Arizona preserved in chloroform\r\nwater (rabbit weighing 1,998 grams). An aqueous extract of 150 grams of\r\nthe dried _Astragalus mollissimus_[155] from Imperial, Nebr. (1906),\r\ncaused death in one hour and fifty-eight minutes in a rabbit weighing\r\n1,530 grams, and an extract of 100 grams killed in one hour and\r\ntwenty-two minutes a rabbit weighing 736 grams.\r\n\r\nAn aqueous extract of 100 grams of the dried _Astragalus bigelowii_\r\ninduced death in one hour and thirty-eight minutes, the rabbit weighing\r\n1,502 grams.\r\n\r\nAn aqueous extract of 150 grams of _Astragalus nitidus_ collected at\r\nWoodland Park, Colo., in 1906 induced death in three hours and five\r\nminutes, the rabbit weighing 1,672 grams.\r\n\r\nAn aqueous extract of 200 grams of the dried _Astragalus bisulcatus_\r\ncaused death after several hours (at night), the rabbit weighing 2,423\r\ngrams.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases this production of acute symptoms was not entirely a\r\nquestion of salt action, as was shown by certain other experiments. In\r\nother cases salt action seems to be the important factor, so that the\r\nproduction of these acute symptoms can not always be considered\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [154] In all cases in which the plants were preserved with\r\n    chloroform sealed vessels were used for shipping. The\r\n    chloroform was carefully evaporated off in vacuo before\r\n    feeding the extract, the evaporation requiring several hours.\r\n    The plants were collected by Dr. C. Dwight Marsh, in charge\r\n    of the field investigations at Hugo, Colo.\r\n\r\n    [155] All extracts from dried material were made at\r\n    Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CHRONIC CASES.=\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 6._--February 19, 1906, a large gray rabbit weighing\r\n2,055.3 grams was fed with 60 c.c. of fluid representing the\r\nconcentrated aqueous extract of 250 grams of the fresh _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_, collected September 18, 1905, and preserved in chloroform.\r\nThis rabbit was very hard to hold. The ears rested on the body. The\r\ntemperature at the time of feeding, 1.30 p.m., was 102.3°F. At 2.57 p.\r\nm. the animal looked dull but resisted handling. At 3.30 p.m. it\r\nurinated. At 4.15 p.m. the temperature was 98.5°F., the pupils were\r\nabout the same size as before feeding, and the animal became much\r\nduller. The next day at 12.50 p.m. the temperature was 102.4°F., and\r\nat this time the animal could be handled with greater ease. The animal\r\nate in the morning. The same amount of extract was again fed at 1.24 p.\r\nm. At 1.35 p.m. the animal was much duller and could be turned on his\r\nback with ease. If disturbed he ran against the wall as if utterly\r\nunconscious of the obstruction. The animal had soft, liquid, brown\r\nstools and tried to lie down as much as possible. If turned on its back\r\nwith the feet up it would stay so almost indefinitely. Temperature,\r\n103.8°F.; respiration very rapid. At 2.40 p.m. the temperature was\r\n99.8°F., and the animal died a few minutes later. After death the\r\npupils were much contracted. The vessels of the dura covering the brain\r\nwere much dilated, but the vessels inside the brain were not dilated.\r\nThe stomach walls were congested and marked with numerous petechiæ and\r\ncovered with mucus.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 7._--On February 19, 1906, a white and brown rabbit\r\nwhose temperature was 103.2°F. was fed 30 c.c. of aqueous fluid\r\nrepresenting the concentrated extract of 125 grams of the fresh\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_, collected September, 1905, and preserved with\r\nchloroform. The rabbit weighed 1,502.5 grams. This extract was fed at\r\n1.45 p.m., and at 4.15 p.m. the temperature was 102.6°F., but there\r\nwere no marked symptoms. The following day at 2.04 p.m. the temperature\r\nregistered 102.5°F. The same amount of extract was given at 2.09 p.m.\r\nThe temperature at 4 p.m. was 99.8°F., the animal was dull, and the\r\npupils were perhaps a little smaller. The animal could not be turned\r\nover without resistance. The following day, February 21, at 1.30 p.m.\r\nthe temperature was 102.6°F., and at 1.45 the same amount of extract\r\nwas given. At 1.54 p.m. the animal was much duller and the breathing\r\nwas very rapid. At 4.10 p.m. the temperature was 101.3°F. The animal\r\nhad been dull ever since the feeding was begun. It nibbled food shortly\r\nbefore the last feeding. On February 23 the same amount of extract was\r\ngiven at 2.16 p.m., temperature 99°F. The breathing was very rapid,\r\nthe ears shaking, and there was a sleepy, dull look about the animal. At\r\n3.30 p.m. the animal was dull, but would still walk about if disturbed.\r\nAt this time the animal weighed 1,445.8 grams. At 4.30 p.m. the\r\ntemperature was 102°F. and the pupils were about normal size. There was\r\na marked sleepy look about the animal, which sat quietly in its cage.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24, at 1 p.m., the animal was very dull and could with ease be\r\nturned on its back with its feet in the air. It would sit in its cage\r\nperfectly quiet. The weight at this time was 1,417.5 grams, the\r\ntemperature 96.6°F. On February 26 the animal weighed 1,360.8 grams. It\r\nwas dull and refused to eat. The abdomen felt very distended and\r\ntympanitic. February 27 the weight was still 1,360.8 grams, and the\r\nanimal sat in its cage as if asleep, with eyes half closed. There was no\r\ndiarrhea and the abdomen was very distended. At 11.15 a.m. there was a\r\ngeneral convulsion and the animal fell over. At 12 m. the abdomen seemed\r\neven more swollen, the animal was hardly able to walk, and it fell over,\r\nuttering a cry. Pupils were about normal--perhaps a little smaller. The\r\nanimal died at 12.10 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe post-mortem, made immediately after death, showed the abdomen\r\nmarkedly tympanitic, and the large intestines could be outlined through\r\nthe abdominal walls with ease. The large intestines were of a chocolate\r\ncolor, intensely congested, and marked with hemorrhages. On opening the\r\nabdomen there was a decided putrefactive odor, and about an ounce of\r\nbloody fluid was found in the peritoneal cavity, together with fibrin\r\nflakes. The stomach was pale, the first three inches of the small\r\nintestine up to where it turned sharply were pale, and below this the\r\nintestines were injected and full of gas and of a dark red color. The\r\nkidneys were 3-1/2 centimeters long and were pale, capsules easily\r\npeeled off; cortex pale. Liver pale and infected with some coccideæ. The\r\ngall bladder was one-quarter inch wide and one inch long. Spleen a\r\ntrifle pale; lungs pale, nothing abnormal; heart relaxed. On opening the\r\nstomach gas and fluid, with some food, exuded. The walls were pale, but\r\npink in some places. There was no marked congestion or hemorrhage or\r\nperforation. The mesenteric vessels were dilated. The upper portion of\r\nthe intestines contained a little mucus-like fluid, but lower down\r\nbecame bloody, and still lower contained pus-like fluid. The walls were\r\nhemorrhagic. The large intestine contained a soft, fecal-like fluid,\r\nvery foul. Its walls were much congested and full of hemorrhagic points.\r\nThe cortex of the suprarenal bodies was sharply defined, the medullæ\r\nbrownish. Brain pale, some dural vessels well marked, no clots or\r\nhemorrhages. Base of brain pale. No congestion seen on cutting into the\r\nbrain. Spinal cord showed no hemorrhages or lymph effusions.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 8._--On February 18, 1906, at 2 p.m., a rabbit whose\r\ntemperature was 102.2°F. was fed with the aqueous extract of 125 grams\r\nof fresh _Astragalus mollissimus_, collected in September, 1905, and\r\npreserved in chloroform, 30 c.c. of the fluid being used. At 4.25 p.m.\r\nthe temperature was 102.4°F. No symptoms were noted. This rabbit\r\nweighed 1,644.3 grams. On February 20 at 2.09 p.m. the temperature was\r\n102.2°F. and the rabbit showed no symptoms. The same dose was repeated\r\nat 2.15 p.m. At 4 p.m. the temperature was 100.3°F. The rabbit was\r\ndull but could not be turned over without a struggle. February 21 at\r\n1.30 p.m. the temperature was 101.4°F. The same amount of extract was\r\nfed at 1.45 p.m. At this time the animal was dull and breathed more\r\nrapidly. At 4.10 p.m. the temperature was 97.3°F. Next day the same\r\namount of extract was again given at 2 p.m. At 2.16 p.m. the breathing\r\nbecame rapid and the animal duller. The ears were directed forward. At\r\n4.15 p.m. the temperature was 101.6°F.; weight 1,757.7 grams; animal\r\nslightly dull. February 24, temperature 102°F., weight 1,786 grams.\r\nMarch 5, weight 1,729.3 grams. The animal was fed at 3.20 p.m. with a\r\nconcentrated extract of 125 grams of _Astragalus mollissimus_, collected\r\nin September. Temperature at time of feeding 100.4°F.; 3.40 p.m., no\r\nsymptoms; 4 p.m., temperature 102°F. March 7, weight 1,644.3 grams;\r\nMarch 8, weight 1,672.6 grams; March 10, weight 1,701 grams; March 12,\r\nweight 1,658.4 grams; March 14, weight 1,701 grams.\r\n\r\nIn this case, where the same dose was given in a period of five days,\r\nvery little effect on the rabbit was noted.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 9._--On March 1, 1906, a black rabbit weighing 2,664.8\r\ngrams was fed with a concentrated aqueous extract of 250 grams of fresh\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_, collected in the fall of 1905.\r\n\r\nOn March 5 the weight was 2,296.3 grams. The animal was then given the\r\nsame amount of extract. During the afternoon it passed mucus and thick\r\npieces of feces and was dull; respiration very rapid. March 6, weight\r\n2,282 grams; March 7, 3 p.m., animal very dull and would not eat; sat\r\nhunched up, but resisted being disturbed: weight 2,310.5 grams. March 8,\r\nweight 2,183 grams; March 9, weight 2,069.5 grams. Pupils dilated;\r\nfinger could be run almost against the eye, provided the lashes were not\r\ntouched, without the animal winking or paying any attention. Rabbit ate\r\nvery little and had not urinated since the preceding day. Left ear had\r\nfallen to the side as if the animal were unable to support it. Weight,\r\n1,912.8 grams. From March 9 to March 11, 67 c.c. of cloudy urine were\r\nvoided. This did not clear with acetic acid. Left eye tearing. March 10,\r\nhead held to right side. March 12, weight 1,786 grams. Left pupil\r\nsmaller than right, neither responding to light. Rabbit very weak. March\r\n14, weight 1,729.3 grams. Would not eat. March 16, weight 1,644.3 grams.\r\nRight pupil larger than left, neither responding to light. Diarrhea\r\npresent. Breathing noisy. In sitting down she raised herself on her\r\nforelegs, evidently to take the pressure off her abdomen, which was\r\ndistended. If disturbed, she would butt against the side of the cage,\r\napparently oblivious of its presence. Knee jerks were very active,\r\nalmost a clonus. Reflex from tendo Achillis active. March 17, forelegs\r\nspread out, head falling to left side. The temperature had fallen below\r\n94°F. and would not register on the ordinary clinical thermometer. The\r\nears twitched, the head was thrown back, the abdomen was distended, and\r\nthe rabbit gritted its teeth. Died. Weight, 1,559.2 grams.\r\n\r\nBrain and spinal cord pale. Dural vessels plainly seen but not marked.\r\nIntestinal vessels congested. Stomach pale; nothing apparent\r\nmacroscopically save a small pin-point ulcer.[156] Heart relaxed.\r\nPost-mortem examination otherwise negative macroscopically.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 10._--A mouse-colored rabbit weighing 1,927.8 grams was\r\nfed February 18, 1906, at 2.26 p.m., with a concentrated aqueous\r\nextract of 250 grams of fresh _Astragalus mollissimus_ collected in\r\nSeptember, 1905, and preserved in chloroform water. The temperature of\r\nthis rabbit was 102.6°F. The fluid given was 40 c.c. At 2.45 p.m. the\r\nrabbit urinated and at 2.57 p.m. was dull and the respiration became\r\nrapid. The animal then aborted and had three young, two of which showed\r\nsome movement after birth, but were apparently premature.\r\n\r\nOn February 23 the temperature of this rabbit was 102.9°F. at 1.40 p.\r\nm. She was then fed with the same amount of the extract as before. At\r\n2.16 p.m. she lay down and became much duller; left ear fallen to side.\r\nAt 3.30 p.m. the rabbit was unable to stand. The pupil of the eye\r\nexposed to the light was dilated. The animal died without a struggle.\r\nThe stomach contained much bloody mucus. In the dependent portion of the\r\nstomach near the cardiac end were marked petechiæ in the walls, with\r\nbright-red blood in the stomach itself. The heart was relaxed. The\r\nintestines showed nothing abnormal. The dural vessels of the brain were\r\ndilated; there was a clot on the dura over the fourth ventricle. Spinal\r\ncord and kidneys normal, the capsules not adhering. Weight, 1,786 grams\r\nat death.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 11._--On March 1, 1906, a rabbit weighing 2,126.2 grams\r\nwas fed with a concentrated aqueous extract of 250 grams of the fresh\r\n_Aragallus lamberti_ preserved in chloroform water. On March 5 this dose\r\nwas repeated, 37.5 c.c. of the fluid being used. March 6 the rabbit\r\nweighed 1,956 grams; March 7, 1,913.6 grams; March 8, 1,828.5 grams;\r\nMarch 9, 1,701 grams; March 12, 1,672.6 grams; March 14, 1,644.3 grams.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 12._ January 19, 1906, a concentrated aqueous extract of\r\n500 grams of the fresh _Aragallus lamberti_ preserved with chloroform\r\nwater was fed to a rabbit weighing 785 grams. The temperature at 12.10\r\np.m., the time of feeding, was 101.6°F. The temperature 1 hour and 43\r\nminutes later was 94.6°F., and the animal died shortly after, showing\r\nthe same condition as occurred after feeding extracts of _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [156] Compare Plönius, W., Beziehungen d.

At 4 p.m. the animal was dull, but still resisted\r\nefforts to handle. On February 24 this animal weighed 2,778.2 grams, and\r\non February 26 it bore a litter of seven young rabbits. One or two of\r\nthese showed movements of the limbs, but were apparently immature. This\r\nrabbit on March 10 weighed 2,537.3 grams; March 12, 2,438 grams; March\r\n14, 2,508.9 grams; March 22, 2,494.7 grams.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 14._--On March 1, 1906, a black rabbit weighing 2,721.6\r\ngrams was fed at 12.15 p.m. with a concentrated aqueous extract of 250\r\ngrams of the fresh _Astragalus mollissimus_ collected in September,\r\n1905. On March 2 it weighed 2,438 grams; at 2.58 p.m. it still resisted\r\nefforts to turn it on its back; at 3.15 p.m. it could be turned on its\r\nback with ease. March 6 the weight was 2,338.8 grams; March 7 the\r\nanimal was very dull, would not eat, pupils dilated, hind legs\r\nparalyzed; died during the night; weight, 2,267.9 grams.\r\n\r\nThe stomach walls were pale save at the dependent portion near the\r\ncardiac end, where there was a hemorrhagic, ulcerated area about 1-1/2\r\nby 1-1/2 inches. The intestines were full of gas, but not hemorrhagic.\r\nThe uterus contained eight immature foeti. The uterine walls were\r\nhemorrhagic. The kidneys weighed 9-1/2 grams; their medullæ were dark\r\nand the straight tubules well defined. The cerebral dural vessels were\r\ncongested and the spinal dural vessels were well defined. The bladder\r\nwas found contracted. The blood gave no bands for methæmoglobin, but\r\nshowed merely those of oxyhæmoglobin on spectroscopic examination.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 15._--Control experiments made by feeding water were\r\nnegative, except when a large quantity (150 c.c.) of water was given to\r\na rabbit weighing 1,020.5 grams. The animal died in 12 hours with marked\r\npallor of the tissues (hydræmia), a pathological condition quite\r\ndifferent from that obtained by feeding extracts of the loco plants, and\r\nno such results were secured with the amount of water used in our\r\nfeeding experiments, 50 to 70 c.c.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTIONS.=\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 16._--On February 28, 1906, a white rabbit weighing\r\n581.2 grams was injected subcutaneously at 10.35 a.m. with a\r\nconcentrated aqueous extract of 83 grams of fresh _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_ collected in September, 1905, and preserved with\r\nchloroform. The temperature before injection was 102.1°F. At 1.40 p.m.\r\nthe animal was dull; at 3.12 p.m. the temperature registered 99.8°F.\r\nThe animal died during the night. The post-mortem examination was\r\nnegative. Stomach pale; heart relaxed save left ventricle, which seemed\r\ncontracted; dural vessels of the brain dilated; kidneys perhaps normal.\r\nNo microscopical examination.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 17._--February 28, 1906, at 10.25 a.m., a guinea pig\r\nweighing 496 grams was injected subcutaneously with a concentrated\r\naqueous extract of 83 grams of the fresh _Astragalus mollissimus_\r\npreserved in chloroform water. At 1.40 p.m. there was muscular\r\ntwitching. The animal was dull and could be easily turned on his back.\r\nThe hind legs began to show weakness. At 1.50 p.m. the hind legs were\r\nalmost completely paralyzed and the animal could be easily turned on his\r\nback. Muscles of the limbs twitched and semen was expelled. Animal died\r\nat 2.15 p.m.\r\n\r\nPost-mortem showed dural vessels of cord and brain full of blood.\r\nStomach pinker than normal: mesenteric vessels dilated. Heart almost\r\nempty of blood. Kidneys congested.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SUMMARY OF FEEDING EXPERIMENTS ON RABBITS.=\r\n\r\nThese experiments indicate that an acute form of poisoning may be\r\ninduced by feeding concentrated aqueous extracts of _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_ and _Aragallus lamberti_ from Hugo, Colo., and Imperial,\r\nNebr., to rabbits, and that if the extract is given in smaller and\r\nrepeated doses a more prolonged or chronic condition may follow.\r\n\r\nThe rabbits showing the chronic effects of these plants exhibit symptoms\r\nwhich have a marked parallelism with those reported as occurring in\r\nlarger herbivora (horses and cattle) on the range when locoed; that is,\r\nthe loss of appetite (Experiment No. 9), the emaciation and loss in\r\nweight (Experiment No. 9), the dullness and stupor, with more or less\r\nanesthesia (Experiment No. 7), the disturbance in the visual function\r\n(Experiment No. 9), and the mental symptoms (Experiment No. 6). The\r\noccasional abortion compares with what has been observed in larger\r\nanimals. The dried _Astragalus mollissimus_ and _Aragallus lamberti_\r\nstill retained their poisonous properties, as we were able to kill with\r\naqueous extracts of the dried plants made in the laboratory under the\r\nproper conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=EXPERIMENTS ON SHEEP.=\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 1._--On May 31, 1906, a sheep weighing 32.2 kilos was\r\nfed with a concentrated aqueous extract of 1,000 grams of the fresh\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_ preserved in chloroform water. The temperature\r\nat 11 o'clock, the time of feeding, was 103.4°F. At 11.45 a.m. this\r\ndose was repeated. At 12 o'clock the temperature was 104.1°F. At 12.45\r\nthe animal urinated. At 1.10 p.m. a similar extract of 2,000 grams was\r\nfed. The total liquid used was 1,500 c.c. On June 1 no symptoms were\r\nnoted. On June 5 an extract of 3,000 grams of fresh _Aragallus lamberti_\r\nand 3,000 grams of _Astragalus mollissimus_ was fed. After feeding this\r\nthe animal could be easily turned over on its back and its ear pricked\r\nwith impunity. The animal at this time weighed 30.8 kilos. On June 6, at\r\n11 a.m., the temperature was 104°F. The sheep had numerous soft\r\nstools, and was very dull, and would not eat. On June 7 the temperature\r\nwas 103.7°F. and the sheep still refused to eat. On the 8th the\r\ntemperature was 103.2°F. at 10.40 a.m., and the stools were still\r\nnumerous and soft.\r\n\r\nThere were then fed 640 c.c., representing the aqueous extract of 4,000\r\ngrams of the fresh _Aragallus lamberti_. The animal could be easily\r\nturned on its back. It weighed at this time 28.57 kilos. On June 9, at\r\n10.47 a.m., the temperature was 103.4°F. The sheep still did not eat,\r\nbut had no diarrhea. It now weighed 27.9 kilos, and the temperature was\r\n103°F. at 10.45 a.m.\r\n\r\nOn June 13 the animal began to eat, and 1,700 c.c. of fluid,\r\nrepresenting 5,500 grams of the fresh _Aragallus lamberti_, were fed.\r\nThe temperature at 12.30 p.m. was 103°F. On June 14 the temperature\r\nwas 103.4°F., the animal weighed 28.3 kilos, and refused food. On June\r\n16 the weight was 28.3 kilos; the temperature at 2 p.m. was 103.5°F.\r\nThere was no diarrhea.\r\n\r\nOn June 19 the aqueous extract of 1,000 grams of the dried _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_ was fed with 420 c.c. of water. The temperature was 102.6°\r\nF. On June 20 the temperature was 102.9°F. at 10.45 a.m.\r\n\r\nOn June 21 500 c.c., representing the aqueous extract of 1,000 grams of\r\nthe dried _Astragalus mollissimus_, were again fed. The animal now\r\nweighed 26.9 kilos. On June 26 the animal weighed 26 kilos, and its gait\r\nwas very uncertain. The temperature was 104.2°F. It was fed 300 c.c.\r\nof fluid, representing the extract of 400 grams of the dried _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_. On June 29 the animal weighed 26.8 kilos and the\r\ntemperature was 102.8°F. It was fed the extract of 1,000 grams of dried\r\n_Astragalus mollissimus_ in 500 c.c. of water. On June 30, at 10.45 a.\r\nm., the temperature was 104.2°F. The animal was very dull and died at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAt autopsy the intestines and stomach merely appeared pale. There were\r\nno worms, and the lungs and other organs appeared normal.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 2._--A lamb weighing 15.4 kilos was fed on July 6, at\r\n1.10 p.m., with 640 c.c. of fluid, representing the extract of 2,000\r\ngrams of _Astragalus mollissimus_. At 1.17 p.m. the animal could be\r\nturned on its back, and it regained its feet with difficulty. At 1.24 p.\r\nm. it urinated and had a stool. The lamb died during the night.\r\n\r\nThe autopsy the following morning showed the heart filled with clots;\r\nlungs normal save for hypostatic congestion. The cerebral and dural\r\nvessels were dilated. About 1-1/2 teaspoonfuls of bloody serum were\r\nfound at the base of the brain. There was none in the lateral\r\nventricles, and no clots. The kidneys exhibited no marked congestion.\r\nThere was no fluid found in the peritoneal or the pleural or pericardial\r\ncavities. The first stomach, however, contained small hemorrhagic spots,\r\nand the second was black. There were small hemorrhages in the\r\nintestines.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 3._--July 13, 1906, a sheep weighing 19.5 kilos was fed\r\nwith 640 c.c. of fluid, representing the extract of 2,000 grams of\r\n_Aragallus lamberti_. The temperature at the time of feeding, 1.10 p.\r\nm., was 105.3°F. At 1.49 p.m. the sheep could be easily turned on its\r\nback. At 2.23 p.m. the temperature was 103.6°F. At 3.42 p.m. the\r\ntemperature was 103.5°F. At 4.20 p.m. the respiration was fairly\r\nrapid. On July 14, at 11.15 a.m., the temperature was 103.6°F. The\r\nsheep would run about but could easily be turned over. It had not eaten,\r\nbut there was diarrhea present. July 15, at 3.30 p.m., the temperature\r\nwas 104°F. The animal had eaten. On July 17 the temperature was 104°F.\r\nand the animal weighed 18.8 kilos. On the 27th it weighed 17.2 kilos; on\r\nAugust 29, 20.8 kilos.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 4._--A lamb weighing 19 kilos was fed August 21, 1906,\r\nwith 740 c.c., representing the aqueous extract of 2,500 grams of the\r\nfresh _Astragalus mollissimus_, shipped to Washington in September,\r\n1905. This animal ate at night, but the following day was dull. When\r\nseen on August 27 there was diarrhea present and the animal was still\r\ndull. On the 28th the animal died, weighing 16.7 kilos. There was no\r\nautopsy on account of decomposition.\r\n\r\n_Experiment No. 5._--A lamb weighing 15.6 kilos was fed on September 4,\r\n1906, with an aqueous extract representing 3,500 grams of the dried\r\n_Aragallus lamberti_, 1,000 c.c. of water being used. The temperature\r\nat the time of feeding was 104.3°F. At 2.48 p.m. the animal on rising\r\nto its feet developed a slight tremor of the fore legs and showed marked\r\ndisinclination to stand on its feet. The temperature was 104°F. The\r\nanimal died at 4.25 p.m. The post-mortem was negative, save for some\r\nreddening of the second stomach.[157]\r\n\r\nThese feeding experiments in sheep can not be considered quantitative,\r\nbecause, as is shown later, aqueous extracts of dried plants are often\r\ninactive, yet poisonous principles may be obtained from the plants by\r\ntreatment with digestive fluids.\r\n\r\nExtracts of dried loco plants vary much in their toxicity; with some the\r\nwriter was unable to kill rabbits, even when an extract of 300 grams of\r\nthe dried plant was used. It is interesting to note that when the field\r\nstation was established at Hugo, Colo., in 1905, almost all the aqueous\r\nextracts of dried specimens sent to Washington would produce the acute\r\nsymptoms of poisoning in rabbits, but during the third season of its\r\nexistence many of the samples sent from the same area were much less\r\nactive, if not inactive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [157] There was a slight odor of chloroform noticed on\r\n    opening the stomach, so that perhaps the imperfect removal of\r\n    the chloroform due to a hurried evaporation of the extract\r\n    should be taken into consideration in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS--CHEMICAL.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that the aqueous extract of 500 grams of the fresh _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_, or of 200 grams (in some cases 100 grams) of the dried\r\nplant, when fed by mouth, would regularly kill a rabbit weighing about\r\n907 grams, with certain definite clinical symptoms and pathological\r\nlesions, was at first arbitrarily selected as our test to aid in the\r\nisolation of the active principle. Later the production of chronic\r\nsymptoms by the aqueous extract or digestion of 200 grams of these dried\r\nplants given in doses of 100 grams each on two successive days was\r\nconsidered essential. Carnivora, such as dogs and cats, vomit so easily\r\nas to render them unsuitable for these investigations. The aqueous\r\nextract was distilled with and without steam, also after acidifying with\r\nsulphuric acid, and likewise after the addition of magnesium oxid, but\r\nin all cases the distillate was inactive.\r\n\r\nThe concentrated aqueous extract was shaken by the Dragendorff method\r\nwith petroleum ether, benzol, chloroform, ether, and amyl alcohol, both\r\nin alkaline and acid condition, but the shakings yielded no\r\nphysiologically active body. Shakings by the Otto-Stas method also\r\nproved inactive. Lead acetate, lead subacetate, silver nitrate, mercuric\r\nchlorid, alcohol, phosphotungstic acid, trichloracetic acid, ammonium\r\nhydrate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrate, Mayer's solution, uranyl\r\nacetate, silver oxid, and barium carbonate also failed to remove the\r\nactive constituent. They gave heavy precipitates in all cases, but these\r\nproved inactive. Hydrocyanic acid was sought for with negative results.\r\nThe pathological lesions in the very acute cases suggested in some\r\nrespects oxalic acid, a saponin, a metal, or perhaps a toxalbumin as the\r\nactive principle, but none of the precipitants for saponins, such as\r\nlead and copper, or the magnesium oxid method yielded a body which was\r\nactive. Proteids were excluded by the fact that the various proteid\r\nprecipitants--alcohol, trichloracetic acid, lead subacetate, mercuric\r\nsulphate or chlorid, and salting out with ammonium sulphate and sodium\r\nchlorid (complete saturation and half saturation)--failed to give an\r\nactive precipitate. Glucosidal or alkaloidal bodies were also excluded.\r\nOn dialysing for twenty-four hours, some of the active principle went\r\ninto the dialysate and some remained in the dialyser. Ether yielded a\r\nprecipitate from alcoholic solution which failed to kill. The\r\npossibility of the activity of the plants being due to its normal\r\nacidity was excluded by neutralizing the extract with sodium hydrate and\r\nprecipitating the salts with alcohol. The filtrate proved active after\r\nremoving the alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe negative results in looking for active alkaloidal, or glucosidal, or\r\nproteid bodies suggested that perhaps the action was due to some\r\ninorganic constituent. The writer then boiled the extract three minutes\r\nand as the filtrate was still found active and the proteid precipitate\r\ninactive became convinced of the inorganic nature of the active\r\nconstituents, and finally incinerated the plant. The acid extract from\r\nthis was also active, but death was delayed several hours. This was\r\nbelieved to be due to the insoluble form into which the compound was\r\nconverted.[158] In fact, the question of solubility and the avoidance of\r\nan acid reaction, which of itself may kill, are the main points to keep\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\nThese experiments indicated that the injurious action toward rabbits of\r\nthe _Astragalus mollissimus_ and _Aragallus lamberti_ collected at Hugo,\r\nColo., was due to one or more inorganic constituents,[159] but it does\r\nnot follow that all loco plants have the same poisonous principle nor\r\nthat the same species occurring on all soils has the same poisonous\r\naction.[160]\r\n\r\nOf _Astragalus mollissimus_ from Imperial, Nebr., collected in 1906, 200\r\ngrams were ashed in a platinum bowl and extracted with water. This\r\naqueous extract when neutralized produced no marked symptoms in a rabbit\r\nand the weight of the animal remained about the same.\r\n\r\nThe ash undissolved after this extraction was then treated with acetic\r\nacid and water overnight, and after carefully evaporating off the acetic\r\nacid on the bath (tested by litmus paper) the residue was fed, partly in\r\nsolution and partly suspended in water, to a rabbit weighing 1,800.2\r\ngrams. Next day the rabbit weighed 1,771.8 grams, showed paralysis of\r\nthe limbs, and died during the morning. The stomach was intensely\r\nreddened and contracted.\r\n\r\nAn extract of a similar ash was made by boiling the same amount with a\r\nlarge quantity of 94 per cent alcohol. This was evaporated in vacuo and\r\ntaken in water and fed to a rabbit weighing 1,459.9 grams. On the sixth\r\nday the animal died, having lost 70.9 grams in weight. The stomach\r\nshowed reddening but no ulcers.\r\n\r\nAn acetic acid aqueous extract, made from the ash after the alcoholic\r\nextraction, proved inactive, showing that the alcohol had removed the\r\nactive bodies. A 70 per cent alcohol extract of another ashed lot proved\r\nactive, killing the rabbit overnight.\r\n\r\nOf _Astragalus mollissimus_ from Imperial, Nebr., 200 grams were ashed\r\nin a platinum bowl and the ash treated with acetic acid water. After\r\nfreeing from acid, one half of the solution and emulsion was fed one day\r\nand the second half fed the following day. The rabbit at the time of\r\nfeeding weighed 1,275.7 grams. Fourteen days later the animal died,\r\nweighing 1,105.6 grams. No autopsy.\r\n\r\nA similar extract of the ash from between 100 and 150 grams of the same\r\ndried plant produced death in a rabbit weighing 1,190 grams in two hours\r\nand fifty-eight minutes.\r\n\r\nThe acetic acid extract of the ash of 125 grams of a mixture of the\r\ndried _Astragalus mollissimus_ and _Aragallus lamberti_ received from\r\nHugo, Colo., June, 1907, after freeing from acid, was fed to a rabbit\r\nweighing 1,304 grams on July 29. On July 30 it weighed 1,332.4 grams.\r\nAugust 1 it weighed 1,219 grams, and it died the same day. The stomach\r\nwas reddened and showed ulcers.\r\n\r\nA similar extract from 250 grams of the same dried plants on boiling\r\ngave a heavy precipitate, but this precipitate was inactive, while the\r\nfiltrate killed a rabbit in four hours.\r\n\r\nOf dry _Aragallus lamberti_ collected in September, 1906, 200 grams were\r\nextracted with water and fed to a rabbit weighing 1,516.7 grams. Two\r\ndays later the animal weighed 1,360 grams and died the same day.\r\n\r\nThe ash from 200 grams of the same dried plant was extracted with acetic\r\nacid, and after evaporating off the acid this was fed to a rabbit\r\nweighing 2,045.3 grams. Seven days later the animal weighed 1,729.3\r\ngrams, having lost 316 grams in weight.\r\n\r\nThe ash from 250 grams of the same species of plant, after similar\r\ntreatment with acetic acid, induced death in a rabbit weighing 2,069\r\ngrams in 2 hours and 20 minutes. The stomach was inflamed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [158] Work is now being done by the writer on the inorganic\r\n    constituents of various plants.\r\n\r\n    [159] Scattered throughout the veterinary literature one\r\n    finds cases of poisoning in animals with symptoms similar to\r\n    those occurring in locoed animals which are attributed to\r\n    eating plants grown on a peculiar soil, as in Oserow, Ueber\r\n    Krankh. d.

Sci.\r\n    Trans., vol. 18, p. 144. 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=EFFECT OF THE AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF ASHED LOCO PLANTS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe filtrate from the ash from 200 grams of dried _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_, from Imperial, Nebr., after similar treatment with acetic\r\nacid water and freed from free acid, killed a rabbit in several hours.\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid also rendered the toxic agent of the ash soluble in\r\nwater, but proved unsuitable for our work, as it was found impossible to\r\nobtain neutral residues by mere evaporation on the bath. At first one of\r\nthe heavy metals or members of the H_{2}S group[161] was suspected, but\r\non passing H_{2}S into the slightly acid extract of the ash no active\r\nprecipitate resulted, but the filtrate remained active.[162] A special\r\nMarsh test was, however, made for arsenic and antimony with negative\r\nresults. A test for tungsten with zinc and hydrochloric acid proved\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nMembers of the ammonium sulphid group were then suspected, but while\r\nammonium hydrate alone gave a heavy white precipitate, this precipitate,\r\nas also the black one with ammonium sulphid, proved inactive save when\r\nnot thoroughly freed from acid (used for solution). The action of this\r\nammonium sulphid precipitate on rabbits was watched for sixteen days,\r\nbut without result. Nevertheless, the writer still suspected some of the\r\nrare earths.[163]\r\n\r\nSestini[164] had found that if certain plants were nourished with a\r\nsolution of a beryllium salt, in the ash of these plants could be shown\r\nthe presence of beryllium.\r\n\r\nTwo grams of beryllium chlorid were fed in aqueous solution to a rabbit\r\nweighing 1,800.2 grams. In four days this animal lost 241 grams and\r\ndied. The stomach showed the same general pallor seen in chronic locoed\r\nrabbits, but no ulcers. The tests for beryllium by Sestini's method,\r\nhowever, failed to show beryllium in the active loco plants examined.\r\n\r\nThorium chlorid, cerium chlorid, and lanthanum chlorid in 2-gram doses\r\nand zirconium chlorid in 3-gram doses produced no chronic symptoms in\r\nrabbits or, in fact, any disturbance. Titanium chlorid, 2.5 grams,\r\nevaporated in the air and then fed in an emulsion to a rabbit, also\r\nproved inactive, but this inactivity may have been due to its\r\ninsolubility.\r\n\r\nThallium nitrate c. p., in aqueous solution, in 2-gram doses, killed a\r\nrabbit weighing 2,154.6 grams in two hours and fifteen minutes. The\r\nstomach in this case, while pink, was not hemorrhagic.\r\n\r\nZirconium chlorid has an astringent taste, and if fed repeatedly will\r\ncause the metallic astringent action. On boiling an acetic acid solution\r\nof the ash with sodium acetate a precipitate formed.[165]\r\n\r\nThe presence of zirconium was thus suspected and Dr. E. C. Sullivan, of\r\nthe United States Geological Survey, estimated it to be present in the\r\nash of a sample of _Aragallus lamberti_ in about 0.01 per cent zirconium\r\noxid, with also 0.1 per cent titanium dioxid.[166]\r\n\r\nZirconium chlorid, 3 grams, was fed in aqueous solution to a rabbit\r\nweighing 850.5 grams. This rabbit lost 96 grams in seven days, and was\r\nthen fed 3 grams more of the same solution and the following day 2 grams\r\nmore. It died eight days later, weighing 656 grams. The stomach and\r\nintestines were contracted, but showed no ulcers. However, 4 grams\r\nkilled a rabbit in two hours and thirty-two minutes.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate, after treating an active solution of the ash with hydrogen\r\nperoxid, proved active, thus showing that zirconium was not entirely\r\nresponsible for the poisonous action.\r\n\r\nYttrium, while not found in the plant, was administered as yttrium\r\nchlorid to a rabbit weighing 1,530 grams in 2-gram doses in solution.\r\nThis animal gained 113.4 grams in five days.\r\n\r\nDidymium chlorid c. p., in 3-gram doses, was fed to a rabbit weighing\r\n1,020 grams. This rabbit lost 70 grams in four days.\r\n\r\nThe administration of manganese acetate[167] in 2-gram doses was\r\nfollowed by a gain in weight of a rabbit of 42.5 grams, while a dose of\r\n3 grams killed a rabbit weighing 1,077 grams in two hours and thirty\r\nminutes. Wohlwill[168] has emphasized the fact that the members of the\r\niron group owe their comparative harmlessness to not being absorbed by\r\nthe gastro-intestinal tract.\r\n\r\nNo zinc was found in the plant.[169]\r\n\r\nIt is well recognized that potassium salts given hypodermically are\r\ndecidedly toxic and that ammonium salts given per os will kill, so that\r\nthe writer considered the possibility of other members of the group\r\nbeing responsible for the injurious action. The fact that the alkaline\r\ndistillate of the plant proved inactive eliminated the ammonium salts.\r\n\r\nCæsium chlorid c. p., 2 grams, was fed in aqueous solution to a rabbit\r\nweighing 1,077.2 grams. In six days this animal lost 255 grams in\r\nweight, when it died.[170]\r\n\r\nA second rabbit, weighing 1,020.5 grams, was fed with 2 grams of the\r\nsame solution and lost 368 grams in twenty-one days. The spectroscopic\r\ntest, however, failed to show cæsium in the ashed plant. Rubidium\r\nchlorid c. p., in 2-gram doses, proved inactive. The platinum chlorid\r\nprecipitate from the extract of the plant proved inactive.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the filtrate after precipitation of the phosphates by tin\r\nand nitric acid and H_{2}S was active excluded the phosphoric acid\r\nradical, and the filtrate after treatment with BaCO_{3} and AgO being\r\nactive excluded the H_{2}SO_{4} and HCl radicals as the toxic body.\r\nFluorine was proved to be absent.\r\n\r\nA radio-active substance was suspected, but Dr. L. J. Briggs, Physicist\r\nof Bureau of Plant Industry, reported that the dried plant showed no\r\nspecial amount of radio-activity.[171]\r\n\r\nPower and Cambier, Sayre, and Kennedy had previously called attention to\r\nthe abundance of calcium in the plant, and the writer's investigations\r\nconfirm this. Pharmacologists are averse to believing calcium given per\r\nos poisonous. The writer has, however, fed 5 grams of the acetate of\r\ncalcium in solution to a rabbit weighing 652 grams. This animal died in\r\ntwo hours, with marked irritation of the stomach, the result being due\r\nto the so-called \"salt action.\" Much larger amounts were fed in divided\r\ndoses, but without injury. Calcium phosphate and calcium sulphate in\r\n2-gram doses proved harmless to a rabbit weighing about 1,400 grams.\r\nThree grams of magnesium acetate[172] were fed in solution for five\r\nsuccessive days to a rabbit weighing 1,417 grams, but without apparent\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nStrontium acetate c. p., in 2-gram doses, likewise caused no\r\ndisturbance.[173] No strontium in any amount recognizable by chemical\r\ntests was proved in the plant. So that by a process of exclusion the\r\nwriter was forced to think of barium as the main cause of the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe writer noted that if the ashed plant was extracted with H_{2}SO_{4}\r\nwater and this extract freed from sulphuric acid with PbCO_{3} and\r\nH_{2}S the solution proved inactive to rabbits and also that after this\r\nextraction the acetic acid extract of the ash failed to kill. In other\r\nwords, the sulphate of our body was insoluble in water. At times in\r\npassing H_{2}S into active solutions of the ashed plant freed from the\r\nacetic acid by evaporation the filtrate and likewise the precipitate\r\nwere inactive. Noyes and Bray[174] have noted that if H_{2}S is passed\r\ninto certain solutions in the presence of an oxydizing agent, such as\r\nferric iron, H_{2}SO_{4} would be formed, which would throw any barium\r\nout of solution.\r\n\r\nIn one blood-pressure record made with a dog (vagi nerves cut), a rise\r\nin blood pressure (a characteristic physiological action of barium) was\r\nseen to follow the intravenous injection of the aqueous extract of the\r\nplant, in spite of its normal acid reaction.\r\n\r\nAccidentally the writer found that Sprengel[175] had reported the\r\npresence of barium in _Astragalus exscapus_, a closely allied plant.\r\nBarium has also been found in the vegetable world by Scheele in 1788,\r\nand later by Eckard,[176] who found it in beech, while Forchhammer[177]\r\nproved it in birch, and Lutterkorth found it in the soil of the same\r\narea in which Eckard worked. Dworzak[178] noted the occurrence of traces\r\nof this element in wheat grown along the Nile, and Knop[179] found it in\r\nthe soil. Doctor Balfour, of Khartum, Egypt, informed the writer that he\r\nknew of no cases in which this barium in wheat had produced poisoning.\r\nHornberger[180] found barium both in the red beech grown in Germany and\r\nin the soil on which these trees grew. It has also been claimed that\r\nvarious marine plants may take up barium from the sea.[181]\r\n\r\nHillebrand[182] has called attention to the fact that the igneous rocks\r\nof the Rocky Mountains showed a higher percentage of barium than rock\r\nfrom other portions of the United States, so that under these conditions\r\none might expect the presence of barium in plants growing in this\r\nregion. A sample of _Aragallus lamberti_ and one of _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_ were sent to the Bureau of Chemistry for spectroscopic\r\nexamination for various elements and they reported traces of barium in\r\neach.[183]\r\n\r\nWith these arguments the writer felt sure of the presence of barium, and\r\nthe matter was discussed with Dr. E. C. Sullivan, of the United States\r\nGeological Survey, and he kindly corroborated the conclusions reached as\r\nto the presence of barium, controlling its presence by means of the\r\nspectroscope, and estimated it roughly as 0.1 per cent BaO in the ash of\r\na sample of _Aragallus lamberti_ (6.3 milligrams BaSO_{4} in 4 grams\r\nash). This determination was made by Hillebrand's method.\r\n\r\nKobert has anticipated this result, saying that \"all plants are in the\r\nposition occasionally to take up barium combinations from the soil,\" and\r\n\"the plants which thus contain barium may act injuriously to men and\r\nanimals.\"[184]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [161] Swain, R.

Thus, from _Aragallus\r\nlamberti_ Dyrenforth obtained 4.32 per cent and O'Brine 13.52 per cent\r\nof ash. The Bureau of Chemistry analyzed two different samples of this\r\ndried plant and reported in one case 11.15 per cent and in the second\r\n11.64 per cent of ash. O'Brine[185] obtained 13.52 per cent of ash from\r\nthe same species. The writer's analysis[186] gave in one sample of\r\n_Aragallus lamberti_, collected at Hugo, Colo., in 1907, 18.8 per cent\r\nof ash; a second lot (1907), 12.44 per cent; a third (1906), 11 per\r\ncent, and a fourth (May, 1905) gave 37.3 per cent of ash.[187] One lot\r\nfrom Woodland Park, Colo. (October, 1906), gave 6.4 per cent. One lot\r\nfrom Hugo, Colo. (October, 1907), yielded 9.6 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the case of _Astragalus mollissimus_, Wentz obtained 6.76 per cent,\r\nSayre 12.01 per cent, Kennedy 20 per cent, O'Brine 12.15 per cent, while\r\nthe sample analyzed by the Bureau of Chemistry gave 18.4 per cent of\r\nash. One sample from Kit Carson County, Colo. (December, 1906), which\r\nproved inactive physiologically, gave an ash content of 6.9 per cent. A\r\nsample of _Astragalus missouriensis_ collected at Hugo, Colo., June,\r\n1907, yielded an ash content of 21.8 per cent, and an _Astragalus\r\nmissouriensis_ collected at Pierre, S. Dak., September, 1907, yielded 27\r\nper cent. An _Astragalus nitidus_ from Custer, S. Dak. (July, 1907),\r\ngave 5.2 per cent ash, while an _Astragalus nitidus_ collected at\r\nWoodland Park, Colo., in October, 1906, yielded 7.8 per cent, and\r\nanother specimen of _Astragalus nitidus_ also collected at Woodland\r\nPark, Colo., in October, 1907, gave 12.2 per cent. An _Astragalus\r\ndrummondii_ from Custer, S. Dak. (July, 1907), gave 5.9 per cent.\r\n_Astragalus pectinatus_ (Hugo, June, 1907) yielded 6.1 per cent. A fresh\r\n(undried) specimen of _Astragalus mollissimus_ (unknown origin,\r\nNovember, 1907) yielded 3.8 per cent of ash. One sample of _Astragalus\r\ndecumbens_ (Ephraim, Utah, August, 1907) gave 21.8 per cent of ash.\r\n\r\nThese determinations must necessarily be only approximate, as the plants\r\nwere collected by different persons who exercised different degrees of\r\ncare in freeing them from adherent soil, and possibly in drying the\r\nplants, so that the main value of these figures is their aid in\r\ndetermining the amount of barium present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [185] The detailed analysis of O'Brine can be found on page\r\n    32 of this report.\r\n\r\n    [186] All ash and barium determinations were made from the\r\n    dried plants save when otherwise specified.\r\n\r\n    [187] Evidently these plants must have been imperfectly freed\r\n    from soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=BARIUM DETERMINATIONS IN THE ASH OF LOCO PLANTS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention has been called to the fact that in ashing plants containing\r\nbarium a part at least of this barium is converted into the insoluble\r\nsulphate and a part into the carbonate, so that the characteristic\r\npharmacological action of the ash will depend not upon the total barium\r\npresent, but upon the form in which it occurs--little action if much\r\nBaSO_{4}, and more complete if more BaCO_{3} results. A further\r\ndifficulty in the recognition of barium in plants is due to the fact\r\nthat certain inorganic salts interfere with the precipitation by\r\nH_{2}SO_{4}.\r\n\r\nA specimen of _Aragallus lamberti_ (Hugo, summer of 1907) with 12.44 per\r\ncent of ash was examined for its barium content by Hillebrand's\r\nmethod.[188] The method was as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo grams of the ash were first fused with sodium carbonate and the\r\nfused mass washed with water containing sodium carbonate. The residue\r\nwas washed into a beaker and treated with a few drops of sulphuric acid.\r\nThe residue now remaining was filtered and after ignition was treated\r\nwith hydrofluoric and sulphuric acids. After evaporating off these\r\nacids, the residue was treated with sulphuric acid water, filtered, and\r\nthen fused with sodium carbonate. After extracting with sodium carbonate\r\nwater, the residue was dissolved in just enough hydrochloric acid and\r\nprecipitated with sulphuric acid. The precipitate was dissolved in\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid and reprecipitated by water and weighed as\r\nBaSO_{4}.[189] So far as the writer can ascertain, there have been no\r\ncontrol experiments made for this method to determine the experimental\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nOf the above ash, 1.998 grams gave 5.2 milligrams of BaSO_{4}, which\r\nwould correspond to 75.75 milligrams of barium acetate crystals--\r\nBa(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}+H_{2}O--in 200 grams of the dried plant. The\r\nresidue by the Hillebrand method after weighing was tested with the\r\nspectroscope and gave a bright spectrum for barium. The same ash was\r\nanalyzed by the Bureau of Chemistry, using a shorter method, and they\r\nreported 2.7 milligrams of barium sulphate in 1.1217 grams of ash. A\r\nsecond sample collected earlier in the summer, with an ash content of\r\n18.6 per cent, was shown to yield barium corresponding to 3.4 milligrams\r\nof BaSO_{4} in 2.5 grams of the ash.[190]\r\n\r\nOne lot of _Aragallus lamberti_ collected at Hugo, Colo., in May, 1905,\r\nand which gave an ash content of 37.3 per cent, was found to yield 3\r\nmilligrams of BaSO_{4} from 1.998 grams of ash, or 173.88 milligrams of\r\nBa(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}+H_{2}O in 200 grams of the dried plant, but this\r\nash also contained 0.27 per cent of SO_{3}. The Bureau of Chemistry\r\nreported the barium to correspond to 2.9 milligrams of BaSO_{4} in 2.45\r\ngrams of the ash.\r\n\r\nThe _Astragalus missouriensis_ (Hugo, June, 1907), with an ash content\r\nof 21.8 per cent, gave 3 milligrams of BaSO_{4} in 2.01 grams of ash,\r\nor 76.58 milligrams of Ba(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}+H_{2}O in 200 grams of\r\nthe dried plant. The residue after weighing was tested spectroscopically\r\nand gave a bright barium spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe _Astragalus drummondii_ from Custer, S. Dak. (1906), _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_ from Kit Carson County, Colo. (December, 1906), and\r\n_Astragalus nitidus_ from Woodland Park, Colo. (October, 1907), were\r\nreported by the Bureau of Chemistry to contain no barium.\r\n\r\nThe ash of the _Astragalus pectinatus_ (Hugo, June, 1907) was reported\r\nby the Bureau of Chemistry to show no barium on spectroscopic\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nTwo grams of active loco plant ash yielded from 5 to 6 milligrams of\r\nBaSO_{4}, but it can be easily seen that in multiplying this amount to\r\ncorrespond to 200 grams of the dried plant errors would be likely to\r\narise, so that the whole amount of barium would not necessarily be\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [188] Hillebrand, W.

Evidently the plant must\r\ncollect minimal quantities of these elements from the soil and store\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe water from a well of an adjacent area was examined by the Bureau of\r\nChemistry and reported to contain 37.4 parts of calcium and 13.7 parts\r\nof magnesium in one million, and that the water contained no\r\nbarium.[191]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [191] Barium has been found in well water in England.

The head soon fell\r\nforward so that the nose rested on the ground. At 10.58 a.m. the rabbit\r\nseemed unable to guide itself and would run into obstructions if forced\r\nto move. There was no diarrhea but it urinated several times. There was\r\na peculiar tremor of the muscles noted. The animal would not startle by\r\nsudden noises and at 11.06 a.m. could be placed on its back with ease.\r\nThe pupils appeared about normal. The whites of the eyes showed very\r\nprominently. At 11.35 a.m. the fore legs were paralyzed. The following\r\nmorning the animal was dead, its weight being 1,120 grams. The heart was\r\ndilated; the stomach was not hemorrhagic, but rather pale.\r\n\r\nA second rabbit, which weighed 1,630 grams, was fed with a solution of\r\n0.5 gram of the same salt at 9.42 a.m. At 10.35 a.m. the animal passed\r\nsoft stools and showed a marked disinclination to move, with evidence of\r\npain. The diarrhea[192] became more marked and the animal's hind\r\nquarters were soiled with feces. At 10.48 a.m. there was marked\r\nincoordination of the limbs and inability to stand. Finally, at 10.56 a.\r\nm., convulsions began and the animal died at 11.02 a.m. The autopsy was\r\nmade about two hours later. The animal was then rigid. The kidneys\r\nseemed rather congested. The intestines were relaxed; mesenteric vessels\r\ndilated. The pyloric region of the stomach appeared hemorrhagic.\r\n\r\nA third rabbit, fed like the preceding with 0.5 gram of barium acetate,\r\nshowed much the same result. In this case there was some retching, but\r\nthe other symptoms were as above, the animal dying in one hour and five\r\nminutes. No hemorrhages were seen in the stomach walls. It was noted\r\nthat after the administration of certain doses, 0.2 gram, there was no\r\ndiarrhea.\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 1907, a rabbit weighing 1,757 grams was fed at 10.42 a.\r\nm. with 0.1 gram of the same barium acetate. The temperature at the time\r\nof feeding was 102.9°F. At 12.05 a.m. the animal urinated.\r\nTemperature, 101.4°F. On September 24 the animal weighed the same.\r\nTemperature at 10.55 a.m., 102.3°F. The same amount of barium was fed.\r\nAt 3.40 p.m. the temperature was 102.5°F. On September 25 the animal\r\nweighed 1,800 grams. Temperature, 102.2°F. at 10.39 a.m. The dose of\r\nbarium was repeated. At 3.55 p.m. the temperature was 101.4°F. On\r\nSeptember 26 at 9.38 a.m. the temperature was 101.1°F., and again the\r\nbarium was given. At 3.57 p.m. the temperature was 101.5°F. On\r\nSeptember 27 the rabbit weighed 1,772 grams. The temperature at 9.53 a.\r\nm. was 102.3°F. The barium was fed for the fifth time. At 10.27 a.m.\r\nthere were general convulsions. The eyes teared. At 10.32 a.m. soft\r\nstools appeared and the animal urinated. Stools were passed at various\r\nperiods. At 11.30 a.m. there were no signs of pain on pinching the ear.\r\nAt 11.58 a.m. the animal retched. The animal was lying with the fore\r\nlegs wide apart and could not support itself. At 12.05 p.m. the\r\ntemperature was 98°F. and the rabbit died shortly after.\r\n\r\nThe peritoneal cavity seemed normal. The small intestines were relaxed,\r\nwhile the mesenteric vessels were dilated. The kidneys seemed congested.\r\nThe stomach walls were pink and in places covered with mucus. The heart\r\nwas relaxed save the left ventricle, which seemed firm.\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 1907, a second rabbit, weighing 1,360 grams, was fed\r\nwith a similar solution and the feeding was repeated at the same time\r\nthe first rabbit was fed. On September 27 the animal weighed 1,416\r\ngrams. On this day a peculiar movement of the hind legs on jumping\r\nappeared, apparently due to an inability to draw the legs completely up,\r\nand the fore legs were spread wide apart, as if too weak to support the\r\nanimal. The temperature had also fallen. On September 28 the animal had\r\napparently recovered. Weight, 1,516 grams on October 21.\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 1907, a third rabbit, weighing 1,304 grams, was fed\r\nwith 50 milligrams of barium acetate. This dose was repeated each time\r\nthe other two rabbits were fed. On September 27 it weighed 1,304 grams.\r\nMarked muscular twitching appeared, with disinclination to move. Finally\r\nthere were convulsions and paralysis of the limbs. No stools were seen.\r\nThis animal lay quiet all night, apparently unable to move, and\r\ncontinued on its side until 3.15 p.m. on September 28, when it\r\ngradually recovered, weighing 1,346 grams on October 24.\r\n\r\nOn October 24, 1907, a rabbit weighing 1,346.5 grams was fed with a\r\nsolution of 25 milligrams of crystallized barium acetate. On the next\r\nday the weight was 1,318 grams, and the dose was repeated. On October 26\r\nit weighed 1,275.7 grams, and the dose was repeated; on October 30 it\r\nweighed 1,332 grams, and on October 31 its weight was 1,375 grams. The\r\nanimal died at night on November 6; weight, 1,134 grams. The post-mortem\r\nexamination, made with Dr. Meade Bolton, of the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, was negative save for the presence of necrotic tissue in one\r\nenlarged thyroid.\r\n\r\nOn October 24, 1907, a rabbit weighing 1,332 grams was fed with a\r\nsolution of 25 milligrams of crystallized barium acetate. On the next\r\nday the animal weighed the same, and the dose was repeated. On October\r\n26 it weighed 1,289 grams, and the same amount of barium was given. On\r\nOctober 28 the weight was 1,219 grams and two days later 1,289 grams.\r\n\r\nOn October 31, 1907, a rabbit weighing 723 grams was fed with a solution\r\nof 25 milligrams of barium acetate. This rabbit was fed in all nine\r\ntimes during a period of ten days. At the end of this time it weighed\r\n779 grams and died six days later, weighing 723 grams. The post-mortem\r\nwas negative.\r\n\r\nA rabbit weighing 779 grams was also fed on October 31, 1907, with a\r\nsimilar amount of barium. This dose was repeated six times during an\r\ninterval of eight days. At the end of that time the animal still\r\nretained its normal weight. On November 14, 1907, it weighed 709 grams,\r\nhaving lost 70 grams. Thus after daily doses of 0.1 gram of crystallized\r\nbarium acetate no symptoms appeared until the fifth day, when death\r\nresulted. After the similar administration of 50 milligrams severe\r\nsymptoms developed on the same day, but the animal recovered. After the\r\nadministration of 25 milligrams on three successive days the animal\r\ndied. In other cases of feeding 25 milligrams for several successive\r\ndays, some lost weight and died; others merely lost in weight, but\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nBary fed a rabbit weighing 0.9 kilogram a solution of 30 milligrams of\r\nbarium chlorid on one day, on the second day 90 milligrams, and on the\r\nthird day 30 milligrams. The only symptom noted was diarrhea. The animal\r\ndied on the fifth day. In other words, after feeding small doses of\r\nbarium salts for several days acute symptoms suddenly set in, showing a\r\ncumulative action. This cumulative action has been noted on man.[193]\r\n\r\nOnsum[194] fed a medium-sized rabbit daily with small doses of barium\r\ncarbonate, beginning with 20 milligrams. When the total amount reached\r\n0.19 grams the rabbit died. The animal before death showed paralysis,\r\nrespiratory disturbances, and fall in temperature. The sensibility of\r\nthe cornea diminished, but the pupils responded to light. The stomach\r\nwalls showed ecchymoses and the blood vessels of the brain, the spinal\r\ncord, and the abdominal vessels were dilated. Emboli in the pulmonary\r\narteries were also noted.\r\n\r\nIn a rabbit the application of 0.66 gram of barium chlorid to a wound\r\nwas followed in twenty minutes by convulsions, paralysis, and finally\r\ncoma and death.[195]\r\n\r\nOf barium nitrate 0.66 gram mixed with sugar and fed to a rabbit caused\r\ndeath in less than one hour, and 0.33 gram induced death in another\r\nrabbit in twenty-seven hours.[196]\r\n\r\nSix grains (0.4 gram) of barium iodid fed in solution to a rabbit caused\r\ndeath the following day. On this day there were tremors of the neck and\r\nshoulders with convulsive movements of the limbs. There was also\r\ngrinding of the teeth. \"The mucous membrane of the stomach was rose-red\r\nat the cardia, and softened.\" Membranes of the cord and brain also were\r\ncongested.[197]\r\n\r\nFor rabbits weighing 1,500 to 2,000 grams the lethal dose of barium\r\nchlorid on subcutaneous use is stated to be 0.05 to 0.06 grams.[198]\r\n\r\nA rabbit weighing 1,106 grams was fed with a solution containing 50\r\nmilligrams of crystallized barium acetate c. p. and 50 milligrams of\r\nzirconium chlorid (pure). In fifty-seven minutes the animal showed\r\ndifficulty in moving the fore legs, developing marked paralysis of the\r\nsame about five hours later, and died the following morning--that is,\r\ntwenty-two hours after feeding. The heart was found dilated, kidneys\r\ncongested, stomach walls pink and covered in places with mucus and\r\npartly digested blood, and cerebral dural vessels dilated, but no clots\r\nwere seen; bladder full.\r\n\r\nMixtures of 0.5 gram of calcium acetate and 50 milligrams of barium\r\nacetate failed to kill. Mixtures of titanium and barium were not tried,\r\nas no titanium salt soluble in water and of neutral reaction was\r\naccessible.\r\n\r\nMittelstaedt called attention to the fact that pregnant rabbits were\r\nmore easily affected by the barium administration than nonpregnant ones,\r\nand noted abortion in one case.[199]\r\n\r\nOne gram of the barium carbonate killed a dog in eight hours. A second\r\ndog died in fifteen hours. Both of these animals vomited so that a\r\nportion of this must have been lost.[200] Barium carbonate was formerly\r\nemployed as a rat poison.[201]\r\n\r\nOf barium chlorid 0.6 gram, fed in aqueous solution, caused death in a\r\ndog in forty-eight minutes if vomiting was prevented.[202]\r\n\r\nIn Tidy's hands 2 grams of the barium nitrate caused death in a small\r\nterrier in three and three-fourth hours. This dog had slight\r\nconvulsions, was almost unable to stand, and had vomiting and purging.\r\nThe reflexes were diminished. A small dog recovered only completely in\r\nfive days after being fed 0.66 gram, while a large dog after being fed\r\n1.3 grams only recovered after two days.\r\n\r\nIn cats 0.8 gram of barium carbonate when introduced into a wound caused\r\non the third day languor, slow respiration, feeble pulse, twitching of\r\nhind legs, dilated pupils, and death.[203]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [192] Magnus, R.

The reports of feeding\r\nexperiments with barium on animals have varied markedly, but now care is\r\nbeing advised in the use of barium salts.[204]\r\n\r\nBarium was introduced into medicine in the treatment of scrofula, but\r\nhas fallen into disuse, and only recently attention has been called to\r\nit on account of its action on the circulatory system. Filippi,[205]\r\nhowever, says, \"The effects on the heart and on the pressure are\r\nalready the first indication of poisoning.\" This metal has also been\r\nused in the treatment of chronic diseases of the spinal cord, as\r\nmultiple sclerosis and paralysis agitans.[206]\r\n\r\nAfter the administration to a woman of 1/12 grain (0.005 gram) of barium\r\nchlorid three to five times a day for a few days, a total of 2-1/4\r\ngrains (0.135 gram), the patient developed rapid respiration, tenderness\r\nover the epigastrium, nausea, constipation, cramps in the limbs, loss of\r\nappetite, weakness, great emaciation, dysuria, some deafness with\r\ntinnitus, difficulty in speaking and thinking, with vertigo.[207] In\r\nthis case the eyes were glassy, the vision indistinct, and the cheeks\r\nflushed. Kohl after the use of small doses of the same noted salivation,\r\nswelling of the gums, and falling out of the teeth, with a mercurial\r\nodor to the breath. Christison[208] states: \"I have known violent\r\nvomiting, gripes, and diarrhea produced in like manner by a quantity not\r\nexceeding the usual medicinal doses.\" According to Kennedy few persons\r\nare able to bear 1/8 grain (0.0075 gram) of barium chlorid.[209]\r\n\r\nIn Carpenter's case after three doses of 1.6 grains (0.070 gram) of\r\nbarium chlorid the patient developed almost lethal symptoms.[210]\r\nCarpenter calls attention to the drowsiness which developed in this\r\npatient after the administration of barium, a fact which had already\r\nbeen noted by Christison.[211]\r\n\r\nA cartarrhal affection of various mucous membranes and a swelling of\r\nvarious glands have been noted, especially of the lymph and salivary\r\nglands, and in the male the testes have at times swollen.[212] The\r\ninflammation of the glands may pass on to suppuration. The skin becomes\r\ndry and shows a tendency to crack. Febrile attacks are reported after\r\nthe repeated use of small doses of barium.\r\n\r\nScheibler[213] has called attention to the possibility of producing\r\n_chronic_ barium poisoning in man from the use of barium in the\r\nmanufacture of food products.\r\n\r\nAcute cases of poisoning in man from four or more grams of barium\r\ncarbonate or chlorid or nitrate have been reported more or less\r\nfrequently.[214] In the acute case of poisoning in man reported by\r\nTiraboschi and Taito, no macroscopic changes were noted in the stomach\r\nmucosa.[215] Lopes[216] has reported one case of acute poisoning in man\r\nfrom less than 1 gram of barium chlorid. In this case paralysis of the\r\nlimbs was a marked feature. Stern[217] cites Perondi and Lisfranc to the\r\neffect that \"remarkably large doses of barium chlorid can be borne\r\nwithout injury by gradually increasing the doses (dissolved in much\r\nwater).\" Lisfranc[218] has suggested that the sensitiveness to poisoning\r\nby barium salts is greater in certain climates than in others.\r\n\r\nNo data are as yet available as to the influence of altitude and partial\r\nstarvation on the toxicity of barium salts. As is well known, almost\r\nall recorded cases of locoed animals have occurred at a high altitude.\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that the addition of one salt to the solution\r\nof another may greatly increase the toxicity of the first one. Thus, the\r\naddition of a few milligrams of barium chlorid to a solution of a\r\nsulphocyanate renders the latter much more poisonous.[219] This may be\r\ndue to the fact that the salts are more completely ionized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [204] According to v.

The heart is usually found relaxed or\r\nthe left ventricle contracted in systole, while the right is relaxed.\r\nOnly once were ecchymoses under the endocardium seen. The liver and\r\nkidneys showed nothing special. The urine was free from albumen and\r\nsugar. In a few cases the lungs showed some infiltration with blood. In\r\nchronic cases, according to our own investigations in rabbits, there are\r\nno characteristic macroscopic lesions, a result which agrees with\r\nMittelstaedt's report.[222] Nothnagel and Rossbach[223] claim that in\r\nchronic poisoning by barium the peripheral nerves are altered. The same\r\nnegative results have also been reported in chronic poisoning in higher\r\nanimals. Reynolds[224] noted a layer like a blood clot under the\r\ncerebellum in a horse fed with barium chlorid. Fuchs[225] has called\r\nattention to the fact that the flesh of cattle poisoned with barium\r\nchlorid was harmless, perhaps owing to a conversion into an insoluble\r\nsalt, a fact which may be considered in the use of locoed animals for\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [220] Schedel, H.

On the following day it\r\nweighed 1,517 grams, and the same dose was again administered. On\r\nOctober 23 the weight was 1,488 grams, and the dose was repeated. On the\r\nnext day the weight was the same and the dose was repeated. On October\r\n26 the weight was 1,446 grams, and again the same extract was given. On\r\nOctober 30 the animal weighed 1,502.5 grams; on October 31, 1,531 grams.\r\nThe animal received a total extract of 475 grams of the dried plant\r\nwithout serious injury. This result was apparently contradictory to the\r\nearlier work.\r\n\r\nOn October 21, 1907, a rabbit weighing 1,743 grams was fed with an\r\nextract of 47.5 grams of the same dried plant. On the next day its\r\nweight was 1,729 grams, and the same amount of the extract was fed. On\r\nOctober 23 the weight remained the same, and the dose was repeated. On\r\nOctober 24 the weight was 1,658 grams, and the same amount of extract\r\nwas fed. On October 26 the animal weighed 1,630 grams, when it was again\r\nfed with the same amount of extract. On October 28 the animal weighed\r\n1,573.5 grams, but two days later the weight had risen to 1,644 grams.\r\nAn extract of 237.5 grams had been administered. Here again the results\r\nappeared contradictory.\r\n\r\nOn October 21, 1907, a rabbit weighing 1,517 grams was fed with an\r\nextract of 77.5 grams. On the next day it weighed 1,545 grams, and the\r\ndose was repeated. On October 23 the animal weighed 1,531 grams, and the\r\nsame amount of extract was given. On the following day it weighed 1,488\r\ngrams, and the dose was repeated. On October 26 it weighed 1,474 grams,\r\nand again the dose was repeated. On October 30 the weight had risen to\r\n1,545 grams, and on October 31 it was 1,559 grams. This animal received\r\nin all an extract of 387.5 grams of the dried plant. An aqueous extract\r\nof 200 grams of the same in one dose also failed to produce the acute\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nThese feeding experiments show little of the characteristic action seen\r\nin the earlier experiments made with aqueous extracts either of the dry\r\nplant or of the fresh plant preserved with chloroform. In other words,\r\nthe aqueous extract of the dried plant was only slightly poisonous, yet\r\nthe plant from which the extract was made contained barium.\r\n\r\nOf this same dried loco 200 grams were then extracted with water and\r\ndigested with pepsin and finally with pancreatin in the thermostat\r\n(37.5°C.). The extract was concentrated and fed to a rabbit weighing\r\n1,616 grams. After five hours and ten minutes the animal appeared weak\r\nin the fore legs and unable to support himself, and he died during the\r\nnight. The intestines the following morning were found full of gas, the\r\nstomach red, the lungs seemed normal, and the heart was relaxed.\r\n\r\nA rabbit weighing 1,545 grams was fed on November 15, 1907, with a\r\npreparation made in a similar manner, save that the plant was not\r\nextracted with water before digestion. On the next day it weighed 1,517\r\ngrams and on November 19, 1,361 grams. The following day the weight was\r\n1,318 grams; on November 21, 1,233 grams, and on the next day 1,162\r\ngrams. The animal died during the night, and the autopsy was made the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\nThe animal was greatly emaciated and the subcutaneous fat had almost all\r\ndisappeared. The mesenteric vessels were dilated, but the intestines\r\nwere not dilated. The peritoneal cavity was normal. The kidneys were\r\nperhaps a little injected, and measured 3 cm. in length. The lungs were\r\nnormal. The left ventricle was contracted and the rest of the heart\r\nrelaxed. The liver was normal and the spleen apparently normal. The\r\nstomach walls were dark, owing to decomposition. No ulcers were seen.\r\nThe suprarenals were perhaps a little enlarged. The examination of the\r\nbrain was negative, and no clots were found.\r\n\r\nA similar digestion from 200 grams of the same dried plant was then\r\nashed and the ash treated with acetic acid and freed from acid by\r\nevaporation on the bath. The ash which was insoluble in water was ground\r\nup into a fine paste and the whole was fed to a rabbit weighing 992\r\ngrams. This animal died in forty minutes, showing the characteristic\r\nsymptoms seen in acute cases already described. In the autopsy the lungs\r\nand other organs seemed perfectly normal macroscopically. The stomach\r\nwalls, however, were reddened and ecchymotic, and the mesenteric vessels\r\nwere dilated.\r\n\r\nOn January 8, 1908, a similar digestion of the same batch was treated\r\nwith a few drops of sulphuric acid to remove the barium, and the\r\nfiltrate was then treated with lead carbonate to remove the sulphuric\r\nacid. After careful filtering, H_{2}S was passed into the solution and\r\nafter concentration was fed in one dose on January 9, 1908, to a rabbit.\r\nThe following morning the rabbit had gained in weight. On January 14\r\nthis animal weighed 30 grams more than its initial weight.\r\n\r\nThe residue of this plant after such a digestion, examined by the\r\nHillebrand method, showed no weighable amount of barium, so that it can\r\nbe seen that barium in relatively large amount was found in the plant\r\nitself, but not after the digestion. It must therefore have been the\r\naqueous digestion which produced the characteristic symptoms. The\r\nexamination of this fluid for barium might, however, be misleading, as\r\nthe large amount of proteids would unquestionably interfere with the\r\ndetermination of this amount of barium, unprotected by other salts and\r\nsilica, so that this side of the investigation was not pursued. Control\r\nfeedings with an emulsion of one-half gram each of pepsin and pancreatin\r\nproved inactive.\r\n\r\nOf the same _Aragallus lamberti_ 200 grams were similarly digested and\r\nthe barium was removed with a few drops of H_{2}SO_{4}, the sulphuric\r\nacid by PbCO_{3} and a little lead acetate, and the lead by H_{2}S. Such\r\nan extract it was shown in the previous experiment would not kill.\r\nHowever, to this extract was added 100 milligrams of crystallized barium\r\nacetate in a solution and a precipitate formed. Nevertheless, the liquid\r\nand the precipitate were fed on February 1, 1908, to a rabbit weighing\r\n1,304 grams. On February 3 the animal weighed 1,233 grams; on February\r\n4, 1,176 grams; February 5, 1,120 grams; February 6, 1,006 grams;\r\nFebruary 7, 1,219 grams; February 8, 1,219 grams; February 10, 1,304\r\ngrams.\r\n\r\nAs a control for this animal, to make sure that the loss in weight was\r\nnot due to the acetic acid set free by the treatment with H_{2}S, a\r\nsimilar aqueous extract of the same lot of _Aragallus lamberti_ was\r\nprecipitated with very much more lead acetate than in the preceding\r\ncases and also with lead subacetate and then H_{2}S. After evaporating\r\nto dryness this was fed on February 8, 1908, to a rabbit weighing 1,035\r\ngrams. On February 11 it weighed 1,021 grams; on February 13, 1,091\r\ngrams, and on February 15, 1,120 grams, showing a gain in weight.\r\n\r\nOf the dried _Astragalus missouriensis_ (Hugo, Colo., June, 1907) 400\r\ngrams with an ash content of 21.8 per cent and which was known to\r\ncontain barium (3 mg. BaSO_{4} in each 2 grams of the ash) were\r\nextracted with water and fed in four doses corresponding to 100 grams\r\neach in a period of four days. On November 18, 1907, the first day of\r\nfeeding, this rabbit weighed 1,856.7 grams. Fifteen days later it\r\nweighed 1,984.3 grams.\r\n\r\nOne hundred grams of this dried plant after extraction with water were\r\nfound to leave about 51.1 grams[226] of the plant undissolved. This when\r\nashed yielded 8.2 grams of ash. Two grams of this ash yielded 5\r\nmilligrams of BaSO_{4}. In other words, the aqueous extract of the plant\r\nwas inactive and the barium was found practically unextracted in the\r\nresidue of the plant.\r\n\r\nEvidently the barium in these dried plants had been converted into an\r\ninsoluble form by drying or by some peculiarity of its metabolism, and\r\nwas not extracted by water, but could be extracted by digesting the\r\nplants with the combined digestive ferments, pepsin and pancreatin.\r\n\r\nOf the same dried _Astragalus missouriensis_ 200 grams were extracted\r\nwith water and the extract treated with lead carbonate to remove any\r\npossible free sulphates and after filtering this was treated with H_{2}S\r\nto remove the lead. As the preceding experiment showed that the aqueous\r\nextract of this dried plant was harmless without barium, the writer\r\ndecided to add barium artificially, and 100 milligrams of barium\r\nphosphate,[227] crystallized, was added to the liquid and the whole fed\r\nto a rabbit weighing 2,423.9 grams. The following morning the rabbit was\r\nfound dead. The autopsy was made by Dr. H. J. Washburn, of the Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry. He found that the suprarenals were enlarged and\r\ncongested, and there were small areas of hepatization at the apex of\r\neach lung. There were also acute corrosion areas on the greater\r\ncurvature of the stomach and over the upper portion of the duodenum.\r\n\r\nOf the _Astragalus missouriensis_ used in the preceding experiments, 200\r\ngrams were extracted thoroughly with water, and the extract\r\ncorresponding to 100 grams, together with 80 milligrams of barium\r\nphosphate pure, was fed on March 12, 1908, to a rabbit weighing 1,261.5\r\ngrams. During this day the animal walked at times with an uncertain gait\r\nand the following morning it weighed 1,233 grams. It was then fed the\r\nrest of the solution, that is, the extract of the remaining 100 grams of\r\nthe plant, but without any barium. The animal soon developed convulsions\r\nand died in a little over twenty-four hours after the original feeding.\r\nThe autopsy, which was made by Dr. J. R. Mohler, of the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, showed that the mucous membrane of the stomach was markedly\r\nhemorrhagic and in areas gelatinous infiltration was very marked. In one\r\nportion of this hemorrhagic area there was distinct erosion. The large\r\nintestines were full of gas, the lungs were normal, the heart was\r\nrelaxed, and the lungs collapsed. The blood vessels of the kidneys were\r\nmarkedly engorged.\r\n\r\nOf the dried _Astragalus nitidus_ (Woodland Park, Colo., October, 1907)\r\nwhich was reported by the Bureau of Chemistry as containing no barium,\r\n200 grams were extracted with water and fed in 100-gram doses for two\r\nsuccessive days. The animal increased steadily in weight and fifteen\r\ndays after the first feeding had gained 99.2 grams. This amount of the\r\nplant was also extracted with water and the residue was then digested\r\nwith pepsin and pancreatin in the thermostat, as in the previous case,\r\nand fed in two doses corresponding to 100 grams each. This animal\r\nincreased in weight, gaining 60 grams in six days and 165 grams in\r\naddition after a further fifteen days.\r\n\r\nAn _Astragalus mollissimus_ (Kit Carson County, Colo., December, 1906),\r\nwhich was also reported by the Bureau of Chemistry as containing no\r\nbarium, was extracted with water, and a dose corresponding to an extract\r\nof 200 grams of the dried plant was fed in one dose without any serious\r\nresult. The same amount of the dried plant was also similarly digested\r\nwith pepsin and pancreatin and fed in two doses, but without the\r\nproduction of any symptoms, the rabbit gaining 60 grams in four days.\r\n\r\nOf the _Aragallus lamberti_ (Hugo, Colo., June, 1907), with an ash\r\ncontent of 12.44 per cent, 250 grams were ashed and the ash treated with\r\nacetic acid and, after evaporating off the acetic acid, was extracted\r\nwith water and the ash digested with pepsin and pancreatin. The aqueous\r\nextract and the digestion products of the ash were then fed after\r\nconcentration, but without any serious effects to the animal, indicating\r\nthat in this plant the barium is in a form insoluble in water and in the\r\nashing is further changed so that it can not now be made soluble by\r\ndigestion--an opposite result to the experiment in which the barium was\r\nfirst rendered soluble by digestion and the digestion products ashed,\r\nsuggesting a possibility that plants might be found in which the barium\r\nis not extracted by digestion, at present a hypothesis.\r\n\r\nOf dried _Astragalus decumbens_ (Ephraim, Utah, 1907), which was\r\nreported by the Bureau of Chemistry to contain no barium, 200 grams also\r\nfailed to produce symptoms in rabbits by our test.\r\n\r\nA solution containing 50 milligrams of barium acetate (crystallized) was\r\nmixed with an aqueous extract of 200 grams of the dried _Aragallus\r\nlamberti_ which had proved inactive pharmacologically, but a precipitate\r\nformed (BaSO_{4}?) and the extract still remained inactive, suggesting\r\nthat the question of toxicity depended not only upon the presence of\r\nbarium, but also whether other agents, such as sulphates, etc., might\r\nnot be present in sufficient amount to render the barium insoluble; that\r\nis, pharmacologically inactive.\r\n\r\nThis _Aragallus lamberti_ yielded an ash content of 37.3 per cent, and\r\nthe SO_{3} group was estimated at 0.27 per cent of the ash, while a\r\ncorresponding lot which was obtained two years later from the same area\r\nyielded an ash content of 12.44 per cent and a SO_{3} content of 0.24\r\nper cent of the ash.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that the full lethal dose of the barium was not always\r\nfound in the plant, yet it must be remembered that the toxic action was\r\nthe resultant of the action of the total constituents and that if the\r\nbarium was removed the extract was practically harmless.\r\n\r\nIn looking back over the work the most suitable preparation for\r\nproducing the characteristic symptoms in rabbits seems to be the freshly\r\nground-up plant mixed with water and preserved in chloroform, for while\r\nthe dried plant might contain barium, yet the aqueous extract was often\r\ninactive, suggesting, perhaps, the presence of something in the fresh\r\nplant which aided the solution of the barium, thus accounting for the\r\nvariations in toxicity of aqueous extracts made from plants dried under\r\nvarying conditions. The nature of the compound in which barium exists in\r\nthe plant is as yet unknown and has not been investigated. _It is\r\nimportant to remember that not only must barium be found in the plant to\r\nprove poisonous, but it must be in such a form that it can be extracted\r\nin the gastro-intestinal canal._\r\n\r\nThe amount of barium found in various species of loco plants will no\r\ndoubt vary, and perhaps the pharmacological test on rabbits as the\r\nwriter has used it may have to be modified for such plants, so that at\r\npresent the wisest plan to test these plants is to determine their\r\nbarium content and also make the physiological test, as has been\r\nproposed, and if the barium content runs low, say below 0.11 per cent of\r\nthe ash, in plants yielding from 12 to 18 per cent of ash, then to\r\nincrease the number of feedings on the rabbit. No doubt on ranges where\r\na large number of loco plants are eaten, with little other food, plants\r\nwith a very low barium content may be poisonous, but if large amounts of\r\nother food are fed the writer would expect few, if any, serious results.\r\n\r\nAs the writer's work has been confined to the laboratory side of the\r\nloco-weed investigations no feeding experiments with barium salts have\r\nbeen made by him on large animals. Such experiments should, of course,\r\nbe made under range conditions; that is, where the water and food supply\r\nis deficient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [226] Some was lost, being attached to the cloth used in\r\n    squeezing the extract.\r\n\r\n    [227] This barium phosphate was determined by the Bureau of\r\n    Chemistry to be BaHPO_{4} and to contain traces of iron,\r\n    sodium, and potassium, but it was free from arsenic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=THEORETICAL ANTIDOTE FOR LOCO-WEED POISONING.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that treatment of the loco-weed extract with a few drops of\r\nsulphuric acid, which will remove the barium, renders these extracts\r\nharmless, and even apparently nutritious, would suggest the theoretical\r\nantidotal treatment to be with sulphates, in the form, perhaps, of epsom\r\nsalts, but perhaps alkaline bicarbonates may be present in the stomach,\r\neither due to lessened acidity of the stomach or from drinking alkaline\r\nwaters, in which case the precipitation of the barium by sulphates would\r\npresumably be interfered with, and thus the treatment be rendered\r\nineffectual.[228] It is interesting to note that most of the remedies\r\nproposed for the successful treatment of locoed animals contain\r\nsulphates.[229]\r\n\r\nIn Storer's experiments on feeding rats with barium carbonate it was\r\nfound that the barium carbonate would kill them, but if calcium\r\ncarbonate was mixed with the barium the rats survived, suggesting an\r\nantidotal action. This apparent antagonism deserves further study and\r\nmay lead to practical results.[230] A somewhat similar antagonism for at\r\nleast a part of the action of barium has been claimed to exist between\r\nbarium and potassium.[231] However, extracts of ashed plants, treated\r\nwith acetic acid, which contained calcium and potassium, caused death in\r\nthe experiments of the writer, but no work has yet been done by him as\r\nto the antidotal action of calcium carbonate on barium. Then, too, as\r\nLüdeking[232] pointed out, large quantities of calcium chlorid may\r\ninterfere with the precipitation of barium as a sulphate. It is well\r\nknown that the presence of various salts influences the solubility of\r\nbarium sulphate in water,[233] and the fact that barium has been found\r\nin solution in the urine in the presence of sulphates shows that the\r\nprecipitation of barium as a sulphate in the body is not so simple as in\r\ntest-tube experiments.[234] Again, in very dilute solutions, such as\r\nmust necessarily occur at any one time in the stomach, the precipitate\r\nwith sulphates only slowly forms and the barium may be absorbed before\r\nthe insoluble compound can be formed.[235] Evidently an important point\r\nto be considered in the antidotal treatment of locoed animals with\r\nsulphates is the possibility of inducing a gastritis, with its attendant\r\nloss of weight. It therefore seems apparent that the proper treatment at\r\npresent is preventive--that is, removal from the plants.\r\n\r\nLewin[236] has suggested the possibility of acquiring some immunity to\r\nbarium, but our experiments point against the production of any\r\npractical immunity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [228] Mendel, L.

A number of deaths in horses have been\r\nattributed to the use of this agent. No doubt the presence of sulphates,\r\netc., derived from the food would render the barium insoluble in the\r\ngastro-intestinal tract, and this would explain the lack of poisonous\r\naction in certain of the cases in which large doses of barium proved\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\nHusard and Biron administered daily doses of 8 grams of barium chlorid\r\nto one horse, and the same amount of barium carbonate to a second horse,\r\nfor several days. A fortnight later the first horse unexpectedly died,\r\nand the second a few days later. The post-mortem examination was\r\nnegative.[240] A third horse fed with barium carbonate also died\r\nsuddenly. Recently barium occurring in brine has given rise to acute\r\npoisoning in stock.[241]\r\n\r\nIn a case reported by Stietenroth[242] the horse died after the\r\ninjection of 0.5 gram of barium chlorid into the jugular vein. A number\r\nof sudden deaths in horses after the intravenous injection of 0.7 gram\r\nand over of barium chlorid have been collected by Fröhner.[243] The\r\nlethal dose by mouth for acute poisoning with barium chlorid in horses\r\nlies between 8 to 12 grams, while cattle require much larger doses (40\r\ngrams)[244] to induce death.\r\n\r\nDieckerhoff advises against the use of barium chlorid in the treatment\r\nof constipation in sheep.\r\n\r\nAfter a dose of 6 grams of barium chlorid a 2-year-old healthy ram\r\nappeared perfectly well, but the following day he was depressed, refused\r\nto eat, staggered, and became so weak that he was unable to stand. The\r\nmuscles of the extremities were paralyzed and the animal died. \"The\r\npost-mortem examination revealed oedema of the lungs, slight\r\ncloudiness of the heart muscles, numerous small hemorrhagic spots on the\r\nmucous membrane of the small intestine, and stagnation of the blood in\r\nthe vessels of the small and large intestines. Similar symptoms and\r\nlesions were found in a lamb 4 months old which was given per os 6.0\r\ngrams of barium chlorid dissolved in 200 grams of distilled water.\"[245]\r\n\r\nPoisonings with barium carbonate have also been reported in pigs.[246]\r\nDomestic animals pastured in the neighborhood of barite deposits soon\r\nsuccumb,[247] and accidental cases of poisoning are reported in cows.\r\nPoisoning in dogs has also been reported after the subcutaneous use of\r\nthis agent.[248] Linossier says that if the barium salts are used for\r\nany time the salts are deposited in various organs, largely in the\r\nkidneys, brain, and medulla, but especially in the bones.[249]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [237] Dieckerhoff.

In the analysis of the writer of one _Aragallus\r\nlamberti_ from Hugo, Colo., it was found to yield 12.44 per cent of ash,\r\nand the barium content corresponded to 2.6 milligrams BaSO_{4} in each\r\ngram of the ash. This would correspond to 10.24 grams of barium acetate\r\n(Ba(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2} + H_{2}O) or 9.15 grams of barium chlorid\r\n(BaCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O) per diem. This amount daily administered would,\r\ntheoretically, readily produce chronic poisoning owing to the\r\naccumulation in the system, as was shown in the case of rabbits.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, some question as to whether this full theoretical\r\namount of loco plants is eaten on the range, and the estimate has been\r\nmade that one-sixth of this amount only would be actually taken. It must\r\nbe remembered, as Stalker pointed out, that locoed animals develop an\r\nespecial taste for these plants and after a time reject other food, so\r\nthat while the number of loco plants at first taken may be small, yet\r\nlater, perhaps, it is greater. A part of this barium, however, may not\r\nbe taken up by the system, but may pass out undissolved. No actual\r\nexperiments have yet been made with cattle by feeding small doses of the\r\npure salt.\r\n\r\nNo doubt more of the pure barium salts will be required to produce\r\nsymptoms of poisoning in animals than would be necessary in the case of\r\nthe form of barium found in the plant, as in the loco-weed the barium is\r\nprobably better protected from precipitation than are the barium salts\r\nwhen dissolved in water alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [250] Lane, C.

Those especially\r\nreferred to here under the term \"loco plants\" are _Astragalus\r\nmollissimus_ and _Aragallus lamberti_.\r\n\r\n(3) The production of chronic symptoms in rabbits is a crucial test of\r\nthe pharmacological activity of these plants.\r\n\r\n(4) The inorganic constituents, especially barium, are responsible for\r\nthis action, at least in the plants collected at Hugo, Colo. Perhaps in\r\nother portions of the country other poisonous principles may be found.\r\n\r\n(5) A close analogy exists between the clinical symptoms and\r\npathological findings in barium poisoning and those resulting from\r\nfeeding extracts of certain loco plants. Small doses of barium salts may\r\nbe administered to rabbits without apparent effect, but suddenly acute\r\nsymptoms set in analogous to what is reported on the range.\r\n\r\n(6) The administration of sulphates, especially epsom salts, to form\r\ninsoluble barium sulphate would be the chemical antidote which would\r\nlogically be inferred from the laboratory work, but of necessity this\r\nwould have to be frequently administered and its value after\r\nhistological changes in the organs have occurred remains to be settled.\r\nBut even the treatment of acute cases of barium poisoning in man is not\r\nalways successful, even when sulphates combined with symptomatic\r\ntreatment are employed. The conditions under which the sulphates fail to\r\nprecipitate barium must be considered. At present it seems best to rely\r\non preventive measures rather than on antidotal treatment.\r\n\r\n(7) Loco plants grown on certain soils are inactive pharmacologically\r\nand contain no barium. In drying certain loco plants the barium\r\napparently is rendered insoluble so that it is not extracted by water,\r\nbut can usually be extracted by digestion with the digestive ferments.\r\n\r\n(8) The barium to be harmful must be in such a form as to be dissolved\r\nout by digestion.\r\n\r\n(9) In deciding whether plants are poisonous it is desirable not merely\r\nto test the aqueous or alcoholic extract, but also the extracts obtained\r\nby digesting these plants with the ferments which occur in the\r\ngastro-intestinal tract.\r\n\r\n(10) It is important that the ash of plants, especially those grown on\r\nuncultivated soil, as on our unirrigated plains, be examined for various\r\nmetals, using methods similar to those by which rocks are now analyzed\r\nin the laboratory of the United States Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n(11) It is desirable to study various obscure chronic conditions, such\r\nas lathyrism, with a view to determine the inorganic constituents of\r\nlathyrus and other families of plants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [251] Résumé of the results of the loco-weed investigations\r\n    carried on by the Bureau of Plant Industry was issued as\r\n    Bulletin 121, part 3, Bureau of Plant Industry, on January\r\n    28, 1908, in the form of papers by C.
