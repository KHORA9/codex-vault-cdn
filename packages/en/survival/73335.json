County and Shire. The Origin of Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term “shire,” which means a division (Anglo-Saxon _sciran_: to cut\r\nor divide), has in Scotland practically the same meaning as “county.”\r\nIn most cases the two names are interchangeable. Yet we do not say\r\nOrkneyshire nor Kirkcudbrightshire. Kirkcudbright is a stewartry and\r\nnot a county, but in regard to the others we call them with equal\r\nreadiness shires or counties. County means originally the district\r\nruled by a Count, the Norman equivalent of Earl. It is said that\r\nAberdeenshire is the result of a combination of two counties, Buchan\r\nand Mar, representing the territory under the rule of the Earl of\r\nBuchan and the Earl of Mar. The distinction is in effect what we mean\r\nto-day by East Aberdeenshire and West Aberdeenshire; and the local\r\nstudents of Aberdeen University when voting for their Lord Rector by\r\n“nations” are still classified as belonging to either the Buchan nation\r\nor the Mar nation according to their place of birth.\r\n\r\nThe counties, then, are certain areas which it is convenient for\r\npolitical and administrative purposes to divide the country into\r\nfor the better and more convenient management of local and internal\r\naffairs. To-day Scotland has thirty-three of these divisions. In a\r\npublic ordinance dated 1305, twenty-five counties are named. They would\r\nseem to have been first defined early in the twelfth century, but as a\r\nmatter of fact nothing very definite is known, either as to the date\r\nof their origin or as to the principles which regulated the making of\r\ntheir geographical boundaries. It is certain, however, that the county\r\ndivisions were in Scotland an introduction from England. The term came\r\nalong with the people who were flocking into Scotland from the south.\r\nThe lines were drawn for what seemed political convenience and no doubt\r\nthey were suited to the times. To-day the boundaries seem on occasion\r\nsomewhat erratic. Banchory, for example, is in Kincardineshire, while\r\nAboyne and Ballater on the same river bank and on the same line of road\r\nand railway are in Aberdeenshire. If the carving were to be done over\r\nagain in the twentieth century, more consideration would probably be\r\ngiven to the railway lines.\r\n\r\nA commission of 1891 did actually rearrange the boundaries. Of the\r\nparishes partly in Aberdeen and partly in Banff, some were transferred\r\nwholly to Aberdeen (Gartly, Glass, New Machar, Old Deer and St Fergus),\r\nwhile others were placed in Banffshire (Cabrach, Gamrie, Inverkeithny,\r\nAlvah and Rothiemay). How it happened that certain parts of adjoining\r\ncounties were planted like islands in the heart of Aberdeenshire may\r\nbe understood by reference to such a case as that of St Fergus.\r\nA large part of this parish belonged to the Cheynes, who being\r\nhereditary sheriffs of Banffshire were naturally desirous of having\r\ntheir patrimonial estates under their own legal jurisdiction, and were\r\ninfluential enough to be able to stereotype this anomaly. This explains\r\nthe place of St Fergus in Banffshire; it is now very properly a part of\r\nAberdeenshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The lone Kirkyard, Gamrie]\r\n\r\nThe county took its name from the chief town—Aberdeen—which is\r\nclearly Celtic in origin and means the town at the mouth of either\r\nthe Dee or the Don. Both interpretations are possible; but the fact\r\nthat the Latin form of the word has always been _Aberdonia_ and\r\n_Aberdonensis_, favours the Don as the naming river. As a matter of\r\nfact, Old Aberdeen, though lying at no great distance from the bank\r\nof the Don, can hardly be said to be associated with Donmouth, whereas\r\na considerable population must from a remote period have been located\r\nat the mouth of the Dee. Whatever interpretation is accepted, it was\r\nthis city—the only town in the district conspicuous for population and\r\nresources—that gave its name to the county as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe whole region between the river Dee and the river Spey, comprising\r\nthe two counties of Banff and Aberdeen, forms a natural province.\r\nThere is no natural, or recognisable line of demarcation between the\r\ntwo counties. Their fortunes have been one. The river Deveron might\r\nconceivably have been chosen as the dividing line, but in practice it\r\nis so only to a limited extent. The whole district, which if invaded\r\nwas never really conquered by the Romans, made one of the seven\r\nProvinces of what was called Pictland in the early middle ages, and\r\nit long continued to assert for itself a semi-independent political\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. General Characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Town House, Old Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nThe county is almost purely agricultural. It has always enjoyed a\r\ncertain measure of maritime activity and of recent years the fishing\r\nindustry, especially at Aberdeen, has made immense progress, but as a\r\nwhole the area is a well-cultivated district. Round the coast and on\r\nall the lower levels tillage is the rule. In the interior the level of\r\nthe land rises rapidly, and ploughed fields give place to desolate\r\nmoors and bare mountain heights in which agriculture is an impossible\r\nindustry. The surface of the lowland parts, now in regular cultivation,\r\nwas originally very rough and rock-strewn. It was covered with erratic\r\nblocks of stone, gneiss and granite (locally called “heathens”), left\r\nby the melting of the ice fields which overspread all the north-east of\r\nScotland during the Ice Age. These stones have been cleared from the\r\nfields and utilised as boundary walls. Some idea of the extraordinary\r\nenergy and excessive labour necessary to clear the land for tillage may\r\nbe gathered from a glance at the “consumption” dyke at Kingswells, some\r\nfive miles from Aberdeen. This solid rampart stretches like a great\r\nbreak-water across nearly half a mile of country, through a dip to the\r\nsouth of the Brimmond Hill. It is five or six feet in height and twenty\r\nto thirty in breadth and contains thousands of tons of troublesome\r\nboulders gathered from the surrounding slopes. The disposal of these\r\nblocks was a serious problem. It has been solved by this rampart. In\r\nother parts the stones were built up into enclosing walls and now serve\r\nthe double purpose of enclosing the fields and providing a certain\r\namount of shelter for crops and cattle. The slopes of the Brimmond Hill\r\nare in certain parts still uncleared and the appearance of these areas\r\nhelps us to realise what this section of the country looked like before\r\nthe enterprising agriculturist braced himself to prepare the surface\r\nfor the use of the plough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Consumption Dyke at Kingswells]\r\n\r\nThe soil, except in the alluvial deposits on the banks of the Don and\r\nthe Ythan, is not of great natural fertility, yet by the exceptional\r\nindustry of the inhabitants and their enterprise as a farming community\r\nit has been raised to a high degree of productiveness. The county now\r\nenjoys a well but hard earned reputation for progressive agriculture.\r\nNotably so in regard to cattle-breeding. It is the home of a breed\r\nof cattle called Aberdeenshire, black and polled, but it is just as\r\nfamous for its strain of shorthorns which have been bred with skill and\r\ninsight for more than a century. In spite, then, of its inferior soil,\r\nits wayward climate and its northern latitude, the inborn stubbornness\r\nand determination of its people have made it a great and prosperous\r\nagricultural region and only those who on a September day have seen\r\nfrom the top of Benachie the undulating plains of Buchan glittering\r\ngolden in the sun can realise what a transformation has been effected\r\non a barren and stony land by the industry of man.\r\n\r\nThe most easterly of the Scottish counties, it abuts like a prominent\r\nshoulder into the North Sea. It has, therefore, a considerable\r\nsea-board partly flat and sandy, partly rocky and precipitous. The\r\npopulation of the numerous villages dotted along this coast used in\r\ntime past to devote themselves to fishing, but the tendency of recent\r\nyears has been to concentrate this industry in the larger towns,\r\nFraserburgh, Peterhead and Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nOther industries there are few. Next to agriculture and fishing comes\r\ngranite, which is the only mineral worthy of mention found in the\r\ncounty. It is the prevailing rock of the district and is quarried to a\r\nconsiderable extent in various parts. A large part of the population\r\nearn their living by this industry, and Aberdeen granite, like Aberdeen\r\nbeef and Aberdeen fish, is a well-known product and travels far. Paper\r\nand wool are also manufactured but only on a moderate scale.\r\n\r\nThere is only one other general feature of the county that deserves\r\nmention and that is its attractiveness as a health resort. The banks\r\nof the Dee, more especially in its upper regions, is a much frequented\r\nholiday haunt; and every summer and autumn Braemar, Ballater and Aboyne\r\nare crowded with visitors from all parts of the country. The late Queen\r\nVictoria no doubt gave the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Punch Bowl, Linn of Quoich, Braemar]\r\n\r\nimpetus to this fashion. Her majesty at an early period of her reign\r\nbought the estate of Balmoral, half-way between Ballater and Braemar,\r\nand having built a royal castle there made it her practice to reside\r\nfor a large part of every year amongst the Deeside hills. Apart from\r\nthis royal advertisement the high altitude of the district, and its\r\ndry, bracing climate, as well as its romantic mountain scenery, have\r\nproved permanently attractive. Here are Loch-na-gar (sung by Byron),\r\nBen-Macdhui, Brae-riach, Ben-na-Buird, Ben-Avon and other Bens,\r\nall of them 4000, or nearly 4000, feet above sea-level, and all of\r\nthem imposing and impressive in their bold and massive forms. These\r\nmountains supply elements of grandeur which exercise a fascination upon\r\npeople who habitually live in a flat country, and Braemar is not likely\r\nto lose its merited popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Size. Shape. Boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nAberdeenshire is one of the large counties in area, standing fifth in\r\nScotland. Although Inverness contains more than twice the number of\r\nsquare miles in Aberdeenshire, its population is far behind that of\r\nAberdeen, which in this respect is the third county in Scotland. Its\r\ngreatest length from N.E. to S.W. is 102 miles; its greatest breadth\r\nfrom N.W. to S.E. is 50. The coast line measures 65 miles and is\r\nlittle indented. The whole area of the county is 1970 square miles, or\r\n1,261,971 acres, of which 6400 are water.\r\n\r\nIn shape the county might be likened to a pear lying obliquely on its\r\nside, the narrow stalk-end being in the mountains, while the rounded\r\nbulging head is the north-eastern sea-board. The flattest portion is\r\nthe region lying north of the Ythan, called Buchan, and even this can\r\nhardly be called flat, for the level is broken by Mormond Hill, near\r\nStrichen, rising to a height of 810 feet. All the way to Pennan Head\r\nthe contour of the land is irregularly wavy. The narrower portion in\r\nthe S.W., called Mar, is entirely mountainous, and midway between\r\nthese two extremes lie the Garioch and Formartin—districts which\r\nare undulating in character. A crescent line drawn from Aberdeen to\r\nTurriff, the convex side being to the S.W., would divide the county\r\ninto two parts, which might be described as lowland and highland. The\r\nlowland portion contains the lower valley of the Don as far up as\r\nInverurie, the valley of the Ythan and all the remaining northern part\r\nof the county. South of this imaginary line the ground rises in ridge\r\nafter ridge until it culminates in the lofty Grampian range of the\r\nCairngorms. The bipartite character of the county, which is reflected\r\nin the occupation and pursuits as in the character and language of\r\nthe two populations, is of some importance, and yet must not be\r\npressed too far, because the population in the one half is practically\r\ninsignificant as compared with that of the other. It follows that when\r\nAberdeenshire men and Aberdeenshire ways are referred to, nine times\r\nout of ten it is the lowland part of the county that is in question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pennan, looking N.W. Showing old and new houses of Troup]\r\n\r\nThe boundaries are, on the east, the North Sea, and on the north\r\nas far west as Pennan Head, the Moray Firth. There Banffshire and\r\nAberdeenshire meet. From that point inland a wavy boundary separates\r\nthe two counties, the Deveron being for part of the way the dividing\r\nline. Above Rothiemay the boundary mounts the watershed between\r\nDeveronside and Speyside, and keeping irregularly to this line past\r\nthe Buck of the Cabrach, and the upper waters of the Don, reaches\r\nBen-Avon. Thence the line moves on to Ben-Macdhui with Loch Avon on\r\nthe right, and at Brae-riach Banffshire ceases to be the boundary.\r\nFor several miles, almost due south in direction, Inverness comes\r\nin as the county on the west. The southern boundary touches three\r\ncounties, Perth, Forfar and Kincardine. At Cairn Ealar, which is the\r\nangle of turning and almost a right angle, the direction changes and\r\nruns east alongside of Perthshire to the Cairnwell Road, and crossing\r\nthis leaves Perthshire at Glas Maol, where it touches Forfarshire.\r\nThe line continues east but with a trend to the north, passing on\r\nthe left Glenmuick, Glentanar and the Forest of Birse, in which the\r\nFeugh takes its rise. On the top of Mount Battock three counties\r\nmeet, Forfar, Aberdeen and Kincardine. Henceforth we are alongside of\r\nKincardineshire and the line bends north-west with a semi-circular\r\nsweep round Banchory-Ternan and the Hill of Fare to Crathes, from a\r\nlittle beyond which, the bed of the Dee becomes the boundary line all\r\nthe way to Aberdeen. In all this area of high ground the line of march\r\nis practically the watershed throughout, marking off the drainage area\r\nof the Don and the Dee from that of the Deveron and the Avon (a\r\ntributary of the Spey) on the one hand, and from that of the Tay and\r\nthe two Esks (south and north) on the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loch Avon and Ben-Macdhui]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Surface, Soil and General Features.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has been already said of the contour of the county it may\r\nbe inferred that its surface is extremely varied. Every variety of\r\nhighland and lowland country is to be found within its limits. Near\r\nthe sea-board the land is gently undulating, never quite flat but\r\nnot rising to any great height till Benachie (1440) is reached. From\r\nthat point onwards, whether up Deveronside or Donside or Deeside, the\r\nmountains rise higher and higher till the Cairngorms, which comprise\r\nsome of the loftiest mountains in the kingdom, are reached. At that\r\npoint we are more than half-way across Scotland, and in reality are\r\nnearer to the Atlantic than to the North Sea. Less than half the land\r\nis under cultivation. Woods and plantations occupy barely a sixth part\r\nof the uncultivated area. The rest is mountain and moor, yielding a\r\nscanty pasturage for sheep and red-deer, and on the lower elevations\r\nfor cattle.\r\n\r\nIn the fringe round the sea-board no trees will grow. It is only when\r\nseveral miles removed from exposure to the fierce blasts that come\r\nfrom the North Sea that they begin to thrive, but the whole Buchan\r\ndistrict is conspicuously treeless. Almost every acre is cultivated and\r\nthe succession of fields covered with oats, turnips and grass, which\r\nfill up the landscape as with a great patchwork, is broken only here\r\nand there by belts of trees round some manor-house or farm-steading.\r\nExcept in a few places the scenery of this lowland portion is devoid\r\nof picturesque interest, yet the woods of Pitfour and of Strichen,\r\nthe policies of Haddo House near Methlick, the quiet silvan beauty\r\nof Fyvie, which more resembles an English than a Scotch village,\r\nthe wooded ridge that overlooks the Ythan at the Castle of Gight,\r\nare charming spots that serve by contrast to accentuate the general\r\ntameness of this lower area.\r\n\r\nIn the higher region, the south-western portions of the county,\r\nagriculture is, to some extent, practised, but it is necessarily\r\nconfined to narrow strips in the valleys of the rivers. The hills,\r\nwhich are rarely wooded, and that only up to fifteen hundred feet above\r\nsea-level, are rounded in shape, not sharp and jagged. They are, where\r\ncomposed of granite, invariably clothed in heather and are occasionally\r\nutilised for the grazing of sheep, but this is becoming less common,\r\nand year by year larger areas are depleted of sheep for the better\r\nprotection of grouse. All the heathery hills up to 2000 feet are grouse\r\nmoors. Throughout the summer these display the characteristic brown\r\ntint of the heather—a tint which gives place in early August to a\r\nrich purple when the heather breaks into flower. Long strips of the\r\nheather-mantle are systematically burned to the ground every spring.\r\nSuch blackened patches scoring with their irregular outlines the sides\r\nof the hills in April and May give a certain amount of variety to the\r\nprevailing tint of brown. They serve a very useful purpose. The young\r\ngrouse shelter in the long and unburnt heather but frequent the cleared\r\nareas for the purpose of feeding on the tender young shoots which\r\nspring up from the blackened roots of the burned plants.\r\n\r\nFurther inland still, where the hills rise to a greater height, they\r\nbecome deer-forests. As a rule these forests are without trees and\r\nare often rockstrewn, bare and grassless. It is only in the sheltered\r\ncorries or by the sides of some sparkling burn, that natural grasses\r\nspring up in sufficient breadth to provide summer pasturage for the\r\nred-deer, which are carefully protected for sporting purposes. Here\r\ntoo the ptarmigan breed in considerable numbers. The grouse moors\r\ncommand higher rents than would be profitable for a sheep-farmer to\r\ngive for the grazing, and every year prior to the 12th of August, when\r\ngrouse-shooting begins, there is an influx of sportsmen from the south,\r\nto enjoy this particular form of sport. The red grouse is indigenous\r\nto Scotland; it seems to find its natural habitat amongst the heather,\r\nwhere in spite of occasional failures in the nesting season, and in\r\nspite of many weeks’ incessant shooting, it thrives and multiplies.\r\nDeer-stalking begins somewhat later; in a warm and favourable summer,\r\nthe stags are in condition early in September. This sport is confined\r\nto a comparative few.\r\n\r\nThe highest mountain in the Braemar district is Ben-Macdhui (4296\r\nfeet). A few others are over 4000—Brae-riach and Cairntoul.\r\nBen-na-Buird and Ben-Avon, which last is notable for the numerous\r\ntors or warty knots along its sky-line, are just under 4000 feet.\r\nLoch-na-gar, a few miles to the east and a conspicuous background\r\nto Balmoral Castle, is 3789. Byron called it “the most sublime and\r\npicturesque of the Caledonian Alps,” and Queen Victoria writing from\r\nBalmoral in 1850 described it as “the jewel of all the mountains\r\nhere.” Its contour lines, which are somewhat more sharply curved than\r\nis usual in the Deeside hills, and the well-balanced distribution of\r\nits great mass make it easily recognised from a wide distance. This\r\npartly explains the pre-eminence which notwithstanding its inferiority\r\nof height it undoubtedly possesses. Due north from Ballater are Morven\r\n(2880) and Culblean, and due south is Mount Keen; a little east and\r\non the boundary line of three counties is Mount Battock. Perhaps the\r\nmost prominent hill, and the one most frequently visible to the great\r\nmajority of Aberdeenshire folks, is Benachie, which stands as a fitting\r\noutpost of the vast regiment of hills. It stands apart and although\r\nonly 1440 feet in height is an unfailing landmark from all parts of\r\nBuchan, from Aberdeen, from Donside, and even from Deveronside. Its\r\nwell-defined outline and projecting “mither tap” render it an object of\r\ninterest from far and near, while the presence or absence of cloud on\r\nits head and shoulders serves as a barometric index to the state of the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Benachie]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Watershed. Rivers. Lochs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have already pointed out, the watershed coincides to a large\r\nextent with the boundary line of the county. The lean of Aberdeenshire\r\nis from west to east so that all the rivers flow in an easterly\r\ndirection to the North Sea. On the west and north-west of the highest\r\nmountain ridges, the slope of the land is to the north-east, and the\r\nSpey with its several tributaries carries the rainfall to the heart of\r\nthe Moray Firth.\r\n\r\nThe chief river of the county is the Dee. It is the longest, the\r\nfullest-bodied, the most picturesque of all Aberdeenshire waters.\r\nTaking its rise in two small streams which drain the slopes of\r\nBrae-riach, it grows in volume and breadth, till, after an easterly\r\ncourse of nearly 100 miles, it reaches the sea at Aberdeen. The\r\nhead-stream is the Garrachorry burn, which flows through the cleft\r\nbetween Brae-riach and Cairntoul. A more romantic spot for the cradle\r\nof a mighty river could hardly be found. The mountain masses rise\r\nsteep, grim and imposing—on one side Cairntoul conical in shape, on\r\nthe other Brae-riach broad and massive, a picture of solidity and\r\nimmobility. The Dee well is 4060 feet above sea-level and 1300 above\r\nthe stream which drains the eastern side of the Larig—the high pass to\r\nStrathspey. As it emerges from the Larig, it is a mere mountain torrent\r\nbut presently it is joined at right angles by the Geldie from the\r\nsouth-west, and the united waters move eastward through a wild glen of\r\nrough and rugged slopes\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Linn of Dee, Braemar]\r\n\r\nand ragged, gnarled Scots firs to the Linn of Dee, 6-3/4 miles above\r\nBraemar. There is no great fall at the Linn, but here the channel of\r\nthe river becomes suddenly contracted by great masses of rock and the\r\nwater rushes through a narrow gorge only four feet wide. The pool below\r\nis deep and black and much overhung with rocks. For 300 yards stretches\r\nthis natural sluice, formed by rocks with rugged sides and jagged\r\nbottom, the water racing past in small cascades. The river is here\r\nspanned by a handsome granite bridge opened in 1857 by Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old bridge of Dee, Invercauld]\r\n\r\nAs the river descends to Braemar, the glen gradually widens out,\r\nand the open, gravelly, and sinuous character of the bed, which is\r\na feature from this point onwards, is very marked. Pool and stream,\r\nstream and pool succeed one another in shingly bends, clean, sparkling\r\nand beautiful. At Braemar the bed is 1066 feet above sea-level. Below\r\nInvercauld the river is crossed by the picturesque old bridge built by\r\nGeneral Wade, when he made his well-known roads through the Highlands\r\nafter the rebellion of 1745. Here the Garrawalt, a rough and obstructed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from old bridge of Invercauld]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Falls of Muick, Ballater]\r\n\r\ntributary, joins the main river. From Invercauld past Balmoral Castle\r\nto Ballater is sixteen miles. Here the bottom is at times rocky, at\r\ntimes filled with big rough stones, at other times shingly but never\r\ndeep. The average depth is only four feet, and the normal pace under\r\nordinary conditions 3-1/2 miles an hour. From Ballater, where the\r\nriver is joined by the Gairn and the Muick, the Dee maintains the same\r\ncharacter to Aboyne and Banchory, where it is joined by the Feugh from\r\nthe forest of Birse. Just above Banchory is Cairnton, where the water\r\nsupply for the town of Aberdeen, amounting on an average to 7 or 8\r\nmillion gallons a day, is taken off. The course of the river near the\r\nmouth was diverted some 40 years ago to the south, at great expense,\r\nby the Town Council, and in this way a considerable area of land was\r\nreclaimed for feuing purposes. The spanning of the river at this point\r\nby the Victoria bridge, which superseded a ferry-boat, has led to the\r\nrise of a moderately sized town (Torry) on the south or Kincardine side\r\nof the river.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of Deeside, all the way from the Cairngorms to the old\r\nBridge of Dee, two miles west of the centre of the city, is varied\r\nand attractive. It is well-wooded throughout; in the upper parts the\r\nbirch, which would seem to be indigenous in the district, adds to the\r\nbeauty of the hill-sides, while the clean pebbly bed of the river and\r\nits swift, dashing flow delight the eyes of those who are familiar only\r\nwith sluggish and mud-stained waters. It is not surprising therefore\r\nthat the district has attained the vogue it now enjoys.\r\n\r\nThe Don runs parallel to the Dee for a great part of its course, but it\r\nis a much shorter river, measuring only 78 miles. It rises at the very\r\nedge of the county close to the point where the Avon emerges from Glen\r\nAvon and turns north to join the Spey. It drains a valley which is only\r\nten or fifteen miles separated from the valley of the larger river. In\r\nits upper reaches it somewhat resembles Deeside, being quite highland\r\nin character; but lower down the river loses its rapidity, becoming\r\nsluggish and winding. Strathdon, as the upper area is called, is\r\nundoubtedly picturesque, but it lacks the bolder features of Deeside,\r\nbeing less wooded and graced with few hills on the grand scale. It has\r\nnot, therefore, become a popular\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Birch Tree at Braemar]\r\n\r\nsummer resort, but its banks form the richest alluvial agricultural\r\nland in the county—\r\n\r\n  A mile o’ Don’s worth twa o’ Dee\r\n  Except for salmon, stone and tree.\r\n\r\nThis old couplet is so far correct. The Dee is a great salmon river,\r\nproviding more first-class salmon angling than any other river of\r\nScotland, while the Don, though owing to its muddy bottom a stream\r\nexcellent beyond measure and unsurpassed for brown trout, is not now,\r\npartly owing to obstruction and pollution, a great salmon river. But\r\nthe agricultural land on Donside, which for the most part is rich deep\r\nloam, about Kintore, Inverurie and the vale of Alford is much more\r\nkindly to the farmer than the light gravelly soil of Deeside, which is\r\nso apt to be burnt up in a droughty summer. In the matter of stone,\r\nthings have changed since the couplet took shape. The granite quarries\r\nof Donside are now superior to any on the Dee; but the trees of Deeside\r\nstill hold their own, the Scots firs of Ballochbuie forest, west of\r\nBalmoral, being the finest specimens of their kind in the north.\r\n\r\nThe nether-Don has been utilised for more than a century as a driving\r\npower for paper and wool mills. Of these there is a regular succession\r\nfor several miles of the river’s course, from Bucksburn to within a\r\nmile of Old Aberdeen. After heavy rains or a spring thaw the lower\r\nreaches of the river, especially from Kintore downwards, are apt to be\r\nflooded, and in spite of embankments which have been erected along the\r\nriver’s course, few years pass without serious damage being done to the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fir Trees at Braemar]\r\n\r\ncrops in low-lying fields. Some parts of Donside scenery, notably\r\nat Monymusk (called Paradise), and at Seaton House just below the\r\nCathedral of Old Aberdeen, and before the river passes through the\r\nsingle Gothic arch of the ancient and historical bridge of Balgownie,\r\nare very fine—wooded and picturesque, and beloved of more than one\r\nfamous artist.\r\n\r\nThe next river is the Ythan, which, rising in the low hills of the\r\nCulsalmond district and flowing through the parish of Auchterless and\r\npast the charming hamlet of Fyvie, creeps somewhat sluggishly through\r\nMethlick and Lord Aberdeen’s estates to Ellon. A few miles below Ellon\r\nit forms a large tidal estuary four miles in length—a notable haunt\r\nof sea-trout, the most notable on the east coast. The river is only\r\n37 miles long. It is slow and winding with deep pools and few rushing\r\nstreams; moreover its waters have never the clear, sparkling quality of\r\nthe silvery Dee. Yet at Fyvie and at Gight it has picturesque reaches\r\nthat redeem it from a uniformity of tameness.\r\n\r\nThe Ugie, a small stream of 20 miles in length, is the only other river\r\nworthy of mention. It joins the sea north of the town of Peterhead. In\r\ncharacter it closely resembles the Ythan, having the same kind of deep\r\npools and the same sedge-grown banks.\r\n\r\nThe Deveron is more particularly a Banffshire river, yet in the Huntly\r\ndistrict, it and its important tributary the Bogie (which gives its\r\nname to the well-known historic region called Strathbogie) are wholly\r\nin Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Don, looking towards St Machar Cathedral]\r\n\r\nThe Deveron partakes of the character of the Dee and the character of\r\nthe Don. It is neither so sparkling and rapid as the one nor so slow\r\nand muddy as the other. Around Huntly and in the locality of Turriff\r\nand Eden, where it is the boundary between the counties, it has some\r\ncharmingly beautiful reaches. Along its banks is a succession of\r\nstately manor-houses, embosomed in trees, and these highly embellished\r\ndemesnes enhance its natural charms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brig o’ Balgownie, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nLakes are few in Aberdeenshire, and such as exist are not specially\r\nremarkable. The most interesting historically are the Deeside Lochs\r\nKinnord and Davan which are held by antiquarians to be the seat of\r\nan ancient city Devana—the town of the two lakes. In pre-historic\r\ntimes there dwelt on the shores of these lakes as also in the valleys\r\nthat converge upon them a tribe of people who built forts, and lake\r\nretreats, made oak canoes, and by means of palisades of the same\r\nmaterial created artificial islands. The canoes which have been\r\nrecovered from the bed of the loch are hollowed logs thirty feet in\r\nlength. Other relics—a bronze vessel and a bronze spearhead, together\r\nwith many beams of oak—have been fished up, all proving the existence\r\nof an early Pictish settlement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loch Muick, near Ballater]\r\n\r\nBesides these, there is in the same district—but south-east of\r\nLoch-na-gar, another and larger lake called Loch Muick. From it flows\r\nthe small river Muick—a tributary of the Dee, which it joins above\r\nBallater. South-west of Loch-na-gar is Loch Callater, which drains\r\ninto the Clunie, another Dee tributary, which joins the main river at\r\nCastleton of Braemar. On the lower reaches of the Dee are the Loch of\r\nPark or Drum, and the Loch of Skene, both of which drain into the Dee.\r\nBoth are much frequented by water-fowl of various kinds.\r\n\r\nThe Loch of Strathbeg, which lies on the east coast not far from\r\nRattray Head, is a brackish loch of some interest. Two hundred years\r\nago, we are told, it was in direct communication with the sea and small\r\nvessels were able to enter it. In a single night a furious easterly\r\ngale blew away a sand-hill between the Castle-hill of Rattray and the\r\nsea, with the result that the wind-driven sand formed a sand-bar where\r\nformerly there was a clear\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loch Callater, Braemar]\r\n\r\nwater-way. Since that day the loch has been land-locked and though\r\nstill slightly brackish may be regarded as an inland loch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeology is the study of the rocks or the substances of which the\r\nearthy crust of a district is composed. Rocks are of two sorts: (1)\r\nthose due to the action of heat, called igneous, (2) those formed and\r\ndeposited by water, called aqueous. When the earth was a molten ball,\r\nit cooled at the surface, but every now and again liquid portions were\r\nejected from cracks and weak places. The same process is seen in the\r\neruptions of Mount Vesuvius, which sends out streams of liquid lava\r\nthat gradually cools and forms hard rock. Such are _igneous_ rocks.\r\nBut all the forces of nature are constantly at work disintegrating the\r\nsolid land; frost, rain, the action of rivers and the atmosphere wear\r\ndown the rocks; and the tiny particles are carried during floods to\r\nthe sea, where they are deposited as mud or sand-beds laid flat one on\r\nthe top of the other like sheets of paper. These are _aqueous_ rocks.\r\nThe layers are afterwards apt to be tilted up on end or at various\r\nangles owing to the contortions of the earth’s crust, through pressure\r\nin particular directions. When so tilted they may rise above water and\r\nimmediately the same process that made them now begins to unmake them.\r\nThey too may in time be so worn away that only fragments of them are\r\nleft whereby we may interpret their history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loch of Skene]\r\n\r\nTo these may be added a third kind of rock called _metamorphic_, or\r\nrocks so altered by the heat and pressure of other rocks intruding upon\r\nthem, that they lose their original character and become metamorphosed.\r\nThey may be either sedimentary, laid down originally by water, or they\r\nmay be igneous, but in both cases they are entirely changed or modified\r\nin appearance and structure by the treatment they have suffered.\r\n\r\nThe geology of Aberdeenshire is almost entirely concerned with igneous\r\nand metamorphic rocks. The whole backbone of the county is granite\r\nwhich has to some extent been rubbed smooth by glacial action; but in a\r\ngreat part of the county the granite gives place to metamorphic rocks,\r\ngneiss, schist, and quartzite. A young geologist viewing a deep cutting\r\nin the soil about Aberdeen finds that the material consists of layers\r\nof sand, gravel, clay, which are loosely piled together all the way\r\ndown to the solid granite. This is the glacial drift, or boulder clay,\r\na much later formation than the granite and a legacy of what is called\r\nthe great Ice Age. Far back in a time before the dawn of history all\r\nthe north-east of Scotland was buried deep under a vast snow-sheet.\r\nThe snow consolidated into glaciers just as in Switzerland to-day, and\r\nthe glaciers thus formed worked their way down the valleys, carrying a\r\ngreat quantity of loose material along with them. When a warmer time\r\ncame, the ice melted and all the sand and boulders mixed up in the ice\r\nwere liberated and sank as loose deposits on the land. This is the\r\nboulder clay which in and around Aberdeen is the usual subsoil. It\r\nconsists of rough, half-rounded pebbles, large and small, of clay,\r\nsand, and shingle, and makes a very cold and unkindly soil, being\r\ndifficult to drain properly and slow to take in warmth.\r\n\r\nBelow this boulder clay are the fundamental rocks. At Aberdeen these\r\nare pure granite; but in other parts of the county they are, as we have\r\nsaid, metamorphic, that is, they have been altered by powerful forces,\r\nheat and pressure. Whether they were originally sedimentary, before\r\nthey were altered, is doubtful; some geologists think the crystalline\r\nrocks round Fraserburgh and Peterhead were aqueous. Mormond Hill was\r\nonce a sandstone, and the schists of Cruden Bay and Collieston were\r\nclay. The same beds traced to the south are found to pass gradually\r\ninto sedimentary rocks that are little altered. Whether they were\r\naqueous or igneous originally, they have to-day lost all their original\r\ncharacter. No fossils are found in them. These rocks are the oldest\r\nand lowest in Aberdeenshire. After their formation, they were invaded\r\nfrom below by intrusive masses of molten igneous rock, which in many\r\nparts of the county is now near the surface. This is the granite\r\nalready referred to. Its presence throughout the county has materially\r\ninfluenced the character and the industry of the people.\r\n\r\nWherever granite enters, it tears its irregular way through the\r\nopposing rocks, and sends veins through cracks where such occur. The\r\nresult of its forcible entrance in a molten condition is that the\r\ncontiguous rocks are melted, blistered, and baked by the intrusive\r\nmatter. Why granite should differ from the lava we see exuding from\r\nactive volcanoes is explained by the fact that it is formed deep below\r\nthe surface where there is no outlet for its gases. It cools slowly\r\nand under great pressure and this gives it its special character. If\r\nfound, therefore, at the surface, as it is in Aberdeen, this is because\r\nthe rocks once high above it, concealing its presence have been worn\r\naway, which gives some idea of the great age of the district. One large\r\ngranitic mass is at Peterhead, where it covers an area of 46 square\r\nmiles, and forms the rocky coast for eight miles; but the whole valley\r\nof the Dee as far as Ben Macdhui, and a great part of Donside, consist\r\nof this intrusive granite. It varies in colour and quality, being in\r\nsome districts reddish in tint as at Sterling Hill near Peterhead, at\r\nHill of Fare, and Corennie; in other parts it is light grey in various\r\nshades.\r\n\r\nThe succession in the order of sedimentary rocks is definitely settled,\r\nand although this has little application to Aberdeenshire, an outline\r\nmay be given. The oldest are the Palaeozoic which includes—in order of\r\nage—\r\n\r\n  Cambrian,\r\n  Silurian,\r\n  Old Red Sandstone or Devonian,\r\n  Carboniferous,\r\n  Permian.\r\n\r\nOf these the only one represented in Aberdeenshire is the Old Red\r\nSandstone, which occupies a considerable strip on the coast from\r\nAberdour to Gardenstown, and runs inland to Fyvie and Auchterless\r\nand even as far as Kildrummy and Auchindoir. The deposit is 1300\r\nfeet thick. A visitor to the town of Turriff is struck by the red\r\ncolour of many of the houses there, a most unusual variant upon the\r\nblue-grey whinstone of the surrounding districts. The explanation is\r\nthat a convenient quarry of Old Red Sandstone exists between Turriff\r\nand Cuminestown. Kildrummy Castle, one of the finest and most ancient\r\nruins in the county, is not like the majority of the old castles built\r\nof granite but of a sandstone in the vicinity. The same band extends\r\nacross country to Auchindoir, where it is still quarried.\r\n\r\nThe next geological group of Rocks, the Secondary or Mesozoic,\r\nincludes—in order of age—\r\n\r\n  Triassic,\r\n  Jurassic,\r\n  Cretaceous.\r\n\r\nThese are not at all or but barely represented. A patch of clay at\r\nPlaidy, which was laid bare in cutting the railway track, belongs\r\nto the Jurassic system and contains ammonites and other fossils\r\ncharacteristic of that period. Over a ridge of high ground stretching\r\nfrom Sterling Hill south-eastwards are found numbers of rolled flints\r\nbelonging to the Cretaceous or chalk period, but the probability is\r\nthat they have been transported from elsewhere by moving ice and are\r\nnot in their natural place.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary epoch is just as meagrely represented as the Secondary.\r\nYet this is the period which in other parts of the world possesses\r\nrecords of the most ample kind. The Alps, the Caucasus, the Himalayas\r\nwere all upheaved in Tertiary times; but of any corresponding activity\r\nin the north-east of Scotland, there is no trace. It is only when the\r\nTertiary merges in the Quaternary period that the history is resumed.\r\nThe deposits of the Ice Age, when Scotland was under the grip of an\r\narctic climate, are much in evidence all over the county and have\r\nalready been referred to. It is necessary to treat the subject in some\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nDuring the glacial period, the snow and ice accumulated on the west\r\nside of the country, and overflowed into Aberdeenshire. There were\r\nseveral invasions owing to the recurrence of periods of more genial\r\ntemperature when the ice-sheet dwindled. One of the earlier inroads\r\nprobably brought with it the chalk flints now found west of Buchan\r\nNess; another brought boulders from the district of Moray. South of\r\nPeterhead a drift of a different character took place. Most of Slains\r\nand Cruden as well as Ellon, Foveran, and Belhelvie are covered with\r\na reddish clay with round red pebbles like those of the Old Red\r\nSandstone. This points to an invasion of the ice-sheet from Kincardine,\r\nwhere such deposits are rife. Dark blue clay came from the west, red\r\nclay from the south, and in some parts they met and intermixed as at St\r\nFergus. A probable third source of glacial remains is Scandinavia. In\r\nthe Ice Age Britain was part of the continental mainland, the shallow\r\nNorth Sea having been formed at a subsequent period. The low-lying land\r\nat the north-east of the county was the hollow to which the glaciers\r\ngravitated from west and south and east, leaving their _débris_ on the\r\nsurface when the ice disappeared. So much is this a feature of Buchan\r\nthat one well-known geologist has humorously described it as the\r\nriddling heap of creation.\r\n\r\nBoth the red and the blue clay are often buried under the coarse earthy\r\nmatter and rough stones that formed the residuum of the last sheet of\r\nice. This has greatly increased the difficulty of clearing the land\r\nfor cultivation. Moreover a clay subsoil of this kind, which forms a\r\nhard bottom pan that water cannot percolate through, is not conducive\r\nto successful farming. Drainage is difficult but absolutely necessary\r\nbefore good crops will be produced. Both difficulties have been\r\nsuccessfully overcome by the Aberdeenshire agriculturist, but only by\r\ndint of great expenditure of time and labour and money.\r\n\r\nThe district of the clays is associated with peat beds. There is peat,\r\nor rather there was once peat all over Aberdeenshire, but the depth\r\nand extent of the beds are greatest where the clay bottom exists. A\r\nclimate that is moist without being too cold favours the growth of\r\npeat and the Buchan district, projecting so far into the North Sea and\r\nbeing subject to somewhat less sunshine than other parts of the county,\r\nprovides the favouring conditions. The rainfall is only moderate but\r\nit is distributed at frequent intervals, and the clay bottom helps to\r\nretain the moisture and thus promotes the growth of those mosses which\r\nafter many years become beds of peat. These peat beds for long provided\r\nthe fuel of the population. In recent years they are all but exhausted,\r\nand the facility with which coals are transported by sea and by rail is\r\ngradually putting an end to the “casting” and drying of peats.\r\n\r\nMoraines of rough gravel—the wreckage of dwindling glaciers—are found\r\nin various parts of the Dee valley. The soil of Deeside has little\r\nintermixture of clay and is thin and highly porous. It follows that in\r\na dry season the crops are short and meagre. The Scots fir, however, is\r\npartial to such a soil, and its ready growth helps with the aid of the\r\nnatural birches to embellish the Deeside landscape.\r\n\r\nIn the Cairngorms brown and yellow varieties of quartz called\r\n“cairngorms” are found either embedded in cavities of the granite or\r\nin the _detritus_ that accumulates from the decomposition of exposed\r\nrocks. The stones, which are really crystals, are much prized for\r\njewellery, and are of various colours, pale yellow (citrine), brown or\r\nsmoky, and black and almost opaque. When well cut and set in silver,\r\neither as brooches or as an adornment to the handles of dirks, they\r\nhave a brilliant effect. Time was when they were systematically dug and\r\nsearched for, and certain persons made a living by their finds on the\r\nhill-sides; but now they are more rare and come upon only by accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Natural History.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in dealing with the glacial movements, Britain was\r\nat one time part of the continent and there was no North Sea. At the\r\nbest it is a shallow sea, and a very trifling elevation of its floor\r\nwould re-connect Scotland with Europe. It follows that our country was\r\ninhabited by the same kind of animals as inhabited Western Europe.\r\nMany of them are now extinct, cave-bears, hyaenas and sabre-toothed\r\ntigers. All these were starved out of existence by the inroads of\r\nthe ice. After the ice disappeared this country remained joined to\r\nthe continent, and as long as the connection was maintained the\r\nland-animals of Europe were able to cross over and occupy the ground;\r\nif the connection had not been severed, there would have been no\r\ndifference between our fauna and the animals of Northern France and\r\nBelgium. But the land sank, and the North Sea filled up the hollow,\r\ncreating a barrier before all the species in Northern Europe had\r\nbeen able to effect a footing in our country. This applies both to\r\nplants and animals. While Germany has nearly ninety species of land\r\nanimals, Great Britain has barely forty. All the mammals, reptiles\r\nand amphibians that we have, are found on the continent besides a\r\ngreat many that we do not possess. Still Scotland can boast of its red\r\ngrouse, which is not seen on the continent.\r\n\r\nWith every variety of situation, from exposed sea-board to sheltered\r\nvalley and lofty mountain, the flora of Aberdeenshire shows a pleasing\r\nand interesting variety. The plants of the sea-shore, of the waysides,\r\nof the river-banks, and of the lowland peat-mosses are necessarily\r\ndifferent in many respects from those of the great mountain heights. It\r\nis impossible here to do more than indicate one or two of the leading\r\nfeatures. The sandy tracts north of the Ythan mouth have characteristic\r\nplants, wild rue, sea-thrift, rock-rose, grass of Parnassus, catch-fly\r\n(_Silene maritima_). The waysides are brilliant with blue-bells,\r\nspeedwell, thistles, yarrow and violas. The peat-mosses show patches\r\nof louse-wort, sundew, St John’s wort, cotton-grass, butterwort and\r\nragged robin. The pine-woods display an undergrowth of blae-berries,\r\ngalliums, winter-green, veronicas and geraniums. The _Linnaea borealis_\r\nis exceedingly rare, but has a few localities known to enterprising\r\nbotanists. The whin and the broom in May and June add conspicuous\r\ncolouring to the landscape while a different tint of yellow shines in\r\nthe oat-fields, which are throughout the county more or less crowded\r\nwith wild mustard or charlock. The granitic hills are all mantled with\r\nheather (common ling, _Calluna erica_) up to 3000 feet, brown in winter\r\nand spring but taking on a rich purple hue when it breaks into flower\r\nin early August. The purple bell-heather does not rise beyond 2000 feet\r\nand flowers much earlier. Through the heather trails the stag-moss,\r\nand the pyrola and the genista thrust their blossoms above the sea\r\nof purple. The cranberry, the crow-berry and the whortle-berry, and\r\nmore rarely the cloudberry or Avron (_Rubus chamaemorus_) are found\r\non all the Cairngorms. The Alpine rock-cress is there also, as well\r\nas the mountain violet (_Viola lutea_), which takes the place of the\r\nhearts-ease of the lowlands. The moss-campion spreads its cushions\r\non the highest mountains; saxifrages of various species haunt every\r\nmoist spot of the hill-sides and the Alpine lady’s mantle, the Alpine\r\nscurvy-grass, the Alpine speedwell, the trailing azalea, the dwarf\r\ncornel (_Cornus suecica_), and many other varieties are to be found by\r\nthose who care to look for them.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, no trees thrive near the coast. The easterly and\r\nnortherly winds make their growth precarious, and where they have been\r\nplanted they look as if shorn with a mighty scythe, so decisive is the\r\nslope of their branches away from the direction of the cold blasts.\r\nTheir growth too in thickness of bole is painfully slow, even a period\r\nof twenty years making no appreciable addition to the circumference of\r\nthe stem. Convincing evidence exists that in ancient times the county\r\nwas closely wooded. In peat-bogs are found the root-stems of Scots fir\r\nand oak trees of much larger bulk than we are familiar with now. The\r\nresinous roots of the fir trees, dug up and split into long strips,\r\nwere the fir-candles of a century ago, the only artificial light of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe district is not exceptional or peculiar in its fauna. The grey or\r\nbrown rat, which has entirely displaced the smaller black rat, is very\r\ncommon and proves destructive to farm crops—a result partially due to\r\nthe eradication of birds of prey, as well as of stoats and weasels, by\r\ngamekeepers in the interest of game. The prolific rabbit is in certain\r\ndistricts far too numerous and plays havoc with the farmer’s turnips\r\nand other growing crops. Brown hares are fairly plentiful but less\r\nnumerous than they were in the days of their protection. Every farmer\r\nhas now the right to kill ground game (hares and rabbits) on his farm\r\nand this helps to keep the stock low. The white or Alpine hare is\r\nplentiful in the hilly tracts and is shot along with the grouse on the\r\ngrouse moors. The otter is occasionally trapped on the rivers, and a\r\nfew foxes\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Deer in time of snow]\r\n\r\nare shot on the hills. The mole is in evidence everywhere up to the\r\n1500 feet level, by the mole-heaps he leaves in every field, and the\r\nmole-catcher is a familiar character in most parishes. The squirrel\r\nhas worked his way north during the last sixty years, and is now to\r\nbe found in every fir-wood. The graceful roedeer is also a denizen of\r\nthe pine-woods, whence he makes forays on the oat-fields. The red-deer\r\nis abundant on the higher and more remote hills, and deer-stalking is\r\nperhaps the most exciting as it certainly is the most exacting of all\r\nforms of Scottish sport. The pole-cat is rarely seen; he is best known\r\nto the present generation in the half-domesticated breed called the\r\nferret. The hedge-hog, the common shrew, and the water-vole are all\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Dunbuy Rock]\r\n\r\nThe birds are numerous and full of interest. The coast is frequented\r\nby vast flocks of sea-gulls, guillemots, and cormorants, while the\r\nestuary of the Ythan has many visitants such as the ringed plover, the\r\neider-duck, the shelduck, the oyster-catcher, redshank, and tern. On\r\nthe north bank of this river the triangular area of sand-dunes between\r\nNewburgh and Collieston is a favourite nesting-place for eider-duck and\r\nterns. The nests of the eider-duck, with their five large olive-green\r\neggs embedded in the soft down drawn from the mother’s breast, are\r\nfound in great numbers amongst the grassy bents. The eggs of the tern,\r\non the other hand, are laid in a mere hollow of the open sand, but\r\nso numerous are they that it is almost impossible for a pedestrian\r\nto avoid treading upon them. Puffins or sea-parrots are conspicuous\r\namongst the many sea-birds that frequent Dunbuy Rock. This island\r\nrock, half-way up the eastern coast, is a typical sea-bird haunt,\r\nwhere gulls, puffins, razorbills and guillemots are to be seen in a\r\nstate of restless activity. A colony of black-headed gulls has for a\r\nnumber of years bred and multiplied in a small loch near Kintore. A\r\nvast number of migratory birds strike the shores of Aberdeenshire every\r\nyear in their westward flight. The waxwing, the hoopoe, and the ruff\r\nare occasional visitors, the great northern diver and the snow-bunting\r\nbeing more frequent.\r\n\r\nThe game-birds of the district are the partridge and the pheasant\r\nin the agricultural region, and the red grouse on the moors. The\r\nhigher hills, such as Loch-na-gar, have ptarmigan, while the wooded\r\nareas bordering on the highland line are frequented by black-cock and\r\ncapercailzie. These last are a re-introduction of recent years and\r\nseem to be multiplying; but, like the squirrel, they are destructive\r\nto the growing shoots of the pine trees and are not encouraged by some\r\nproprietors. The lapwing or green plover’s wail is an unfailing sound\r\nthroughout the county in the spring. These useful birds are said to be\r\nfewer than they were fifty years ago—a result probably due to the\r\ndemand for their eggs as a table delicacy. After the first of April\r\nit is illegal to take the eggs, and this partial protection serves\r\nto maintain the stock in fair numbers. The starling, which, like the\r\nsquirrel, was unknown in this district sixty years ago, has increased\r\nso rapidly that flocks of them containing many thousands are now a\r\ncommon sight in the autumn. The kingfisher is met with, very, very\r\nrarely on the river-bank, but the dipper is never absent from the\r\nboulder-strewn beds of the streams. The plaintive note of the curlew\r\nand the shriller whistle of the golden plover break the silence of the\r\nlonely moors. The golden eagle nests in the solitudes of the mountains\r\nand may occasionally be seen, soaring high in the vicinity of his eyrie.\r\n\r\nOf fresh-water fishes, the yellow or brown trout is plentiful in\r\nall the rivers, especially in the Don and the Ythan. The migratory\r\nsea-trout and the salmon are also caught in each, although the Dee is\r\npre-eminently the most productive. The salmon fisheries round the coast\r\nand at the mouth of the rivers are a source of considerable revenue.\r\nThe fish are caught by three species of net, bag-nets (floating nets)\r\nand stake-nets (fixed) in the sea, and by drag-nets or sweep-nets in\r\nthe tidal reaches of the rivers. Time was when drag-nets plied as far\r\ninland as Banchory-Ternan (19 miles), but these have gradually been\r\nwithdrawn and are now relegated to a short distance from the river\r\nmouth, the rights having been bought up by the riparian proprietors\r\nfurther up the river, who wish to obtain improved opportunities for\r\nsuccessful angling. The Dee has, in this way, been so improved that it\r\nis now perhaps the finest salmon-angling river in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe insects of the district call for little remark. Butterflies are\r\nfew in species and without variety. It is only in certain warm autumns\r\nthat the red admiral puts in an appearance. The cabbage-white, the\r\ntortoise-shell, and an occasional meadow-brown and fritillary are the\r\nprevailing species.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Ythan, the Ugie, and the Don are frequented by\r\nfresh-water mussels which produce pearls. These grow best on a pebbly\r\nbottom not too deep and are 3 to 7 inches long and 1-1/2 to 2-1/2\r\nbroad. The internal surface is bluish or with a shade of pink. The\r\nsearch for these mussels in order to secure the pearls they may and\r\ndo sometimes contain was once a recognised industry. To-day it is\r\nspasmodic and mostly in the hands of vagrants. Many beds are destroyed\r\nbefore the mussels are mature and this lessens the chances of success.\r\nThe pearl-fisher usually wades in the river, making observation of the\r\nbottom by means of a floating glass which removes the disturbing effect\r\nof the surface ripple. He thus obtains a clear view of the river-bed,\r\nand by means of a forked stick dislodges the mussels and brings them\r\nto bank, 150 making a good day’s work. He opens them at leisure and\r\nfinds that the great majority of his pile are without pearls. If he\r\nbe lucky enough, however, to come upon a batch of mature shells he\r\nmay find a pearl worth £20. As a rule the price is not above ten or\r\ntwenty shillings. Much depends on the size and the colouring. The most\r\nvaluable are those of a pinkish hue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Round the Coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harbour-mouth, which is also the mouth of the Dee, is the beginning\r\nof the county on the sea-board. It is protected by two breakwaters,\r\nnorth and south, which shelter the entrance channel from the fury of\r\neasterly and north-easterly gales. To the south, in Kincardineshire, is\r\nthe Girdleness lighthouse, 185 feet high, flashing a light every twenty\r\nseconds with a range of visibility stated at 19 miles. To the north of\r\nthe harbour entrance are the links and the bathing station. The latter\r\nwas erected in 1895 and has since been extended, every effort being\r\nmade to add to the attractiveness of the beach as a recreation ground.\r\nA promenade, which will ultimately extend to Donmouth, is in great part\r\ncomplete; and all the other usual concomitants of a watering-place have\r\nbeen introduced with promising success so far, and likely to be greater\r\nin the near future.\r\n\r\nFrom Donmouth the northward coast presents little of interest. All\r\nthe way to the estuary of the Ythan is a region of sand-dunes bound\r\ntogether by marum grass and stunted whins, excellent for golf courses,\r\nbut lacking in variety. In the sandy mounds in the vicinity of the\r\nYthan have been found many flint chippings and amongst them leaf-shaped\r\nflint arrow-heads, chisels and cores, as well as the water-worn stones\r\non which these implements were fashioned. These records of primitive\r\nman as he was in the later Stone Age are conspicuous here, and are\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Girdleness Lighthouse]\r\n\r\nto be seen in other parts of the county. In the rabbit burrows, which\r\nare abundant in the dunes, the stock-dove rears her young. In 1888\r\na migratory flock of sand-grouse took possession of the dunes, and\r\nremained for one season.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Ythan are the Forvie sands—a region of hummocks under which\r\na whole parish is buried. The destruction of the parish took place\r\nseveral centuries ago, when a succession of north-easterly gales,\r\ncontinued for many days, whipped up the loose sand of the coast-dunes\r\nand blew it onward in clouds till the whole parish, including several\r\nvaluable farms, was entirely submerged. The scanty ruins of the old\r\nchurch of Forvie is the only trace left of this sand-smothered hamlet.\r\n\r\nNot far from the site of the Forvie church is a beautiful semi-lunar\r\nbay called Hackley Bay, where for the first time since Aberdeen\r\nwas left behind, rocks appear, hornblende, slate, and gneiss. At\r\nCollieston, a village consisting of a medley of irregularly located\r\ncottages scrambling up the cliff sides, a thriving industry used to\r\nbe practised, the making of Collieston “speldings.” These were small\r\nwhitings, split, salted and dried on the rocks. Thirty years ago they\r\nwere considered something of a delicacy and were disposed of in great\r\nquantities; now they have lost favour and are seldom to be had. At the\r\nnorth end of the village is St Catherine’s Dub, a deep pool between\r\nrocks, on which one of the ships of the Spanish Armada was wrecked in\r\n1588. Two of the St Catherine’s cannon very much corroded have been\r\nbrought up from the sea-floor. One of them is still to be seen at\r\nHaddo House, the seat of the Earl of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nNorthward we come upon a region of steep grassy braes, consisting\r\nof soft, loamy clay, 20 to 40 feet deep, and covered with luxuriant\r\ngrasses in summer and ablaze with golden cowslips in the spring\r\nmonths. Along the coast are several villages which once populous with\r\nbusy and hardy fishermen are now all but tenantless. Such are Slains\r\nand Whinnyfold crushed out of activity by the rise of the trawling\r\nindustry. The next place of note is Cruden Bay Hotel built by the Great\r\nNorth of Scotland Railway Company, and intended to minister specially\r\nto the devotees of golf, for which the coast links are here eminently\r\nsuitable. The fine granite building facing the sea is a conspicuous\r\nlandmark. Just north of the Hotel is the thriving little town of Port\r\nErrol, through which runs the Cruden burn—a stream where sea-trout are\r\nplentifully caught at certain seasons. The next prominent object is\r\nSlains castle—the family seat of the Earls of Errol. It stands high\r\nand windy, presenting a bold front to the North Sea breezes. All its\r\nwindows on the sea-face are duplicate, a necessary precaution in view\r\nof the fierceness of the easterly gales. Very few plants grow in this\r\nexposed locality, and these only in the hollow and sheltered ground\r\nbehind the castle, where some stunted trees and a few garden flowers\r\nstruggle along in a precarious existence. As we proceed, the rocky\r\ncoast rises higher and bolder and presents variable forms of great\r\nbeauty. Beetling crags enclose circular bays with perpendicular walls\r\non which the kittiwake, the guillemot, the jackdaw and the starling\r\nbreed by the thousand. The rock of Dunbuy, a huge mass of granite,\r\nsurrounded by the sea, and forming a grand rugged arch, is a summer\r\nhaunt of sea-birds and rock-pigeons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sand Hills at Cruden Bay]\r\n\r\nAfter this, we reach the picturesque and much visited Bullers of\r\nBuchan—a wide semi-circular sea cauldron, the sides of which are\r\nperpendicular cliffs. The pool has no entry except from the seaward\r\nside, and it is only in calm weather that a boat is safe to pass\r\nthrough the low, open archway in the cliff. In rough weather, the waves\r\nrush through the narrow archway with terrific force, sending clouds\r\nof spray far beyond the height of the cliffs. Under proper conditions\r\nthe scene is one of the grandest in Aberdeenshire, and is a fitting\r\ncontrast to the sublimely impressive scenes at the source of the Dee,\r\nright at the other end of the county. Beyond the Bullers, the coast\r\nconsists of high granite rocks, behind which are windswept moors. Near\r\nBoddam is Sterling Hill quarry, the source of the red-hued Peterhead\r\ngranite. Here too is Buchan Ness, the most easterly point on the\r\nScottish coast, and a fitting place for a prominent lighthouse. The\r\nlantern of the circular tower (erected in 1827) stands 130 feet above\r\nhigh-water mark and flashes a white light once every five seconds. The\r\nlight is visible at a distance of 16 nautical miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The Pot,” Bullers o’ Buchan]\r\n\r\nAt Peterhead, which is a prosperous fishing centre and the eastern\r\nterminus of the bifurcate Buchan line of railway, is a great convict\r\nprison, occupying an extensive range of buildings on the south side of\r\nthe Peterhead bay. The convicts are employed in building a harbour of\r\nrefuge, which is being erected under the superintendence of the\r\nAdmiralty at a cost of a million of money. The coast onwards to the\r\nUgie mouth is still rocky, but from the river to Rattray Head, the\r\nrocks give place to sand-dunes similar in character to those further\r\nsouth. Alongside of the dunes is a raised sea beach. They form the\r\nlinks of St Fergus. Rattray Head is a rather low reef of rock running\r\nfar out to sea and highly suitable as a lighthouse station. In the\r\ncourse of twelve years, the reef was responsible for 24 shipwrecks.\r\nThe lighthouse erected in 1895 is 120 feet high and the light gives\r\nthree flashes in quick succession every 30 seconds. It is visible 18\r\nmiles out to sea. Beyond this point is a region of bleak and desolate\r\nsands. Not a tree nor a shrub is to be seen. The inland parts are\r\nunder cultivation, but the general aspect of the country is dismal and\r\ndreary, and the very hedgerows far from the sea-board lean landwards\r\nas if cowering from the scourges of the north wind’s whip. The country\r\nis undulatory without any conspicuous hill. Beyond Rattray Head is\r\nthe Loch of Strathbeg already referred to. The tradition goes that\r\nthe same gale as blighted Forvie silted up this loch and contracted\r\nits connection with the sea. On the left safely sheltered from the\r\nsea-breezes are Crimonmogate, Cairness and Philorth—all mansion-houses\r\nsurrounded by wooded grounds. At the sea-edge stand St Combs (an echo\r\nof St Columba), Cairnbulg and Inverallochy. Here occurs another raised\r\nsea beach. Our course from Rattray Head has been north-west and thus we\r\nreach the last important town on the coast—Fraserburgh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buchan Ness Lighthouse]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kinnaird Lighthouse, Fraserburgh]\r\n\r\nFraserburgh lies to the west of its bay. Founded by one of the Frasers\r\nof Philorth (now represented by Lord Saltoun), it is like Peterhead a\r\nthriving town. Like Peterhead too, it is the terminus of one fork of\r\nthe Buchan Railway and a busy fishing centre. In the month of July,\r\nwhich is the height of the herring season, “the Broch,” as it is called\r\nlocally, is astir with life from early morn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance to Lord Pitsligo’s Cave, Rosehearty]\r\n\r\nMore herrings are handled at Fraserburgh than anywhere else on this\r\ncoast, from Eyemouth to Wick. Between Fraserburgh and Broadsea is\r\nKinnaird’s Head. Here we have another lighthouse which has served that\r\npurpose for more than a century, an old castle having been converted\r\nto this use in 1787. It was one of the first three lighthouses in\r\nScotland. Kinnaird’s Head is believed to be the promontory of the\r\nTaixali mentioned by the Alexandrian geographer Ptolemy as being at the\r\nentrance of the Moray Firth. Here the rocks are of moderate height but\r\nfurther west they fall to sea-level and continue so past Sandhaven and\r\nPittullie to Rosehearty. A low rocky coast carries us to Aberdour bay,\r\nwhere beds of Old Red Sandstone and conglomerate rise to an altitude of\r\n300 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aberdour Shore, looking N.W.]\r\n\r\nThe conglomerate extends to the Red Head of Pennan—once a quarry for\r\nmill-stones—where an attractive and picturesque little village nestles\r\nat the base of the cliff. The peregrine falcon breeds on the rocky\r\nfastnesses of these lofty cliffs, which continue to grow in height and\r\ngrandeur till they reach their maximum (400 feet) at Troup Head. Troup\r\nHead makes a bold beginning for the county of Banff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Weather and Climate. Temperature. Rainfall. Winds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of a county depends on a good many things, its latitude,\r\nits height above sea-level, its proximity to the sea, the prevailing\r\nwinds, and especially as regards Scotland whether it is situated on the\r\neast coast or on the west. The latitude of Great Britain if the country\r\nwere not surrounded by the sea would entitle it to a temperature only\r\ncomparable to that of Greenland but its proximity to the Atlantic\r\nredeems it from such a fate. The Atlantic is 3° warmer than the air and\r\nthe fact that the prevailing winds are westerly or south-westerly helps\r\nto raise the mean temperature of the western counties higher than that\r\nof those on the east. The North Sea is only 1° warmer than the air so\r\nthat its influence is less marked.\r\n\r\nStill, considering its latitude (57°-57° 40’), Aberdeenshire enjoys a\r\ncomparatively moderate climate. It is neither very rigorous in winter\r\nnor very warm in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rainfall Map of Scotland. (After Dr H. R. Mill)]\r\n\r\nsummer. Of course in a large county a distinction must be drawn between\r\nthe coast temperature and that of the high lying districts such as\r\nBraemar. The fringe round the coast is in the summer less warm than the\r\ninland parts, a result due to the coolness of the enclosing sea, but in\r\nthe winter this state of affairs is reversed and the uplands are held\r\nin the grip of a hard frost while the coast-side has little or none.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of Scotland is 47°, while Aberdeen has 46°·4 and\r\nPeterhead 46°·8. That of Braemar, the most westerly station in the\r\ncounty, though in reality very little lower, is arrived at by entirely\r\ndifferent figures; the temperature being much higher during July,\r\nAugust and September, but lower in December, January and February.\r\nBraemar is 1114 feet above sea-level and since there is a regular and\r\nuniform decline in temperature to the extent of 1° for every 270 feet\r\nabove the sea, the temperature of this hill-station should be low. As\r\na matter of fact, from June to September it is only 9° and in October\r\n7°·5 below that of London. Yet its maximum is 10° higher than is\r\nrecorded at Aberdeen, only in winter its minimum is 20° lower than the\r\nminimum of the coast.\r\n\r\nBraemar and Peterhead as lying at the two extremes of the county\r\nmay be compared. Peterhead receives the uninterrupted sweep of the\r\neasterly breezes, for it has no shelter or protection either of forests\r\nor mountains. The impression a visitor takes is that Peterhead is\r\nan exceptionally cold place. As a fact, its mean winter temperature\r\nis above the average for Scotland, but the lack of shelter and the\r\nconstant motion of the air give an impression of coldness. In the\r\nsummer and autumn its mean falls below that of Scotland. It is\r\ntherefore less cold in the cold months and less warm in the warm months\r\nthan Braemar and has a seasonal variation of only 16°·3 between winter\r\nand summer, whereas Edinburgh has a range of 21° and London of 26°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Inverey near Braemar]\r\n\r\nThe rainfall over the whole county is also moderate, ranging from less\r\nthan 25 inches at Peterhead—the driest part of the area—to 40 inches\r\nat Braemar, and 32 at Aberdeen. This is a small rainfall compared\r\nwith 60 or 70 inches on parts of the west coast. The driest months\r\nin Aberdeenshire are April and May, and generally speaking less rain\r\nfalls in the early half of the year when the temperature is rising\r\nthan in the later half when the temperature is on the decline. Two\r\ninches is about the average for each month from February to June, but\r\nOctober, November and December are each over three inches. The most of\r\nthe rainfall of Scotland comes from the west and south. This explains\r\nwhy the west coast is so much wetter than the east. The westerly winds\r\nfrom the Atlantic, laden with moisture, strike upon the high lands\r\nof the west, but exhaust themselves before they reach the watershed\r\nand, having precipitated their moisture between that and the coast,\r\nthey reach the east coast comparatively dry. Braemar just under the\r\nwatershed is relatively dry. Its situation as an elevated valley, 1114\r\nfeet above sea-level and surrounded on three sides by hills of from\r\nthree to four thousand feet, and the fact that it is 60 miles from the\r\nsea combine to make it one of the most bracing places and give it one\r\nof the finest summer climates in the British Isles. This sufficiently\r\naccounts for its popularity as a health resort. May is its driest\r\nmonth, October its wettest.\r\n\r\nEasterly winds bring rain to the coast, but as a rule the rain extends\r\nno further inland than 20 miles. Easterly winds prevail during March,\r\nApril and May, which make this season the most trying part of the\r\nyear for weakly people. In summer the winds are often northerly, but\r\nthe prevailing winds of the year, active for 37 per cent. of the 365\r\ndays or little less than half, are west and south-west. East winds\r\nbring fog, and this is most prevalent in the early summer, June being\r\nperhaps the worst month. The greatest drawback to the climate from an\r\nagriculturist’s point of view is the lateness of the spring. The summer\r\nbeing short, a late spring means a late harvest, which is invariably\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe low rainfall of the county is favourable to sunshine. Aberdeen has\r\n1400 hours of sunshine during the year in spite of fogs and east winds;\r\nthe more inland parts being beyond the reach of sea-fog have an even\r\nbetter record.\r\n\r\nThe great objection—an objection taken by folks who have spent part\r\nof their life in South Africa or Canada—is the variableness of the\r\nclimate from day to day. There is not here any fixity for continued\r\nperiods of weather such as obtains in these countries. The chief factor\r\nin this variability is our insular position on the eastern side of the\r\nAtlantic. When, on rare occasions, as sometimes happens in June or in\r\nSeptember, the atmosphere is settled, Aberdeenshire enjoys for a few\r\nweeks weather of the most salubrious and delightful kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. The People—Race, Language, Population.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blood of the people of Aberdeenshire, though in the main Teutonic,\r\nhas combined with Celtic and other elements, and has evolved a\r\ndistinctive type, somewhat different in appearance and character from\r\nwhat is found in other parts of Scotland. How this amalgamation came\r\nabout must be explained at some length.\r\n\r\nThe earliest inhabitants of Britain must have crossed from Europe when\r\nas yet there was no dividing North Sea. They used rough stone weapons\r\n(see p. 114) and were hunters living upon the products of the chase,\r\nthe mammoth, reindeer and other animals that roamed the country. Such\r\nwere _palaeolithic_ (ancient stone) men. Perhaps they never reached\r\nScotland: at least there is no trace of them in Aberdeenshire. They\r\nwere followed by _neolithic_ (new stone) men, who used more delicately\r\ncarved weapons, stone axes, and flint arrows. Traces of these are to be\r\nfound in Aberdeenshire. A few short cists containing skeletal remains\r\nhave been found in various parts of the county. In the last forty years\r\nsome fifteen of these have been unearthed. From these anthropologists\r\nconclude that neolithic men lived here at the end of the stone age,\r\nmen of a muscular type, of short stature and with broad short faces.\r\nThey were mighty hunters hunting the wild ox, the wolf and the bear\r\nin the dense forests which, after the Ice Age passed, overspread the\r\nnorth-east. They clothed themselves against the cold in the skins of\r\nthe animals which they made their prey and were a rude, savage, hardy\r\nrace toughened by their mode of life and their fierce struggle for\r\nexistence. They did not live by hunting alone; they possessed herds\r\nof cattle, swine and sheep and cultivated the ground but probably\r\nonly to a slight extent. Their weapons were rude arrow-heads, flint\r\nknives and flint axes; and a considerable number of these primitive\r\nweapons as well as the bones of red-deer and the primeval ox—_bos\r\nprimigenius_—have been recovered from peat-mosses and elsewhere\r\nthroughout the district. Such have been found at Barra, at Inverurie\r\nand at Alford.\r\n\r\nBesides these remains, have been found urns made of boulder clay,\r\nburned by fire and rudely ornamented. These were very likely their\r\noriginal drinking vessels, afterwards somewhat modified as food\r\nvessels, and were, it is supposed, deposited in graves with a religious\r\nmotive in accordance with the belief common among primitive peoples\r\nthat paradise is a happy hunting-ground in which the activities of the\r\npresent life will continue under more favourable conditions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these relics the county has a great number of stone\r\ncircles, circles of large upright boulders set up not at hap-hazard\r\nbut evidently with some definite object in view. These will be dealt\r\nwith in a later chapter. The probability is that the so-called Pictish\r\nhouses, the earth or Eirde houses found on Donside and the lake\r\ndwellings at Kinnord already referred to, were the homes of these\r\npeople. But the whole subject is by no means clear. The general opinion\r\nis that the north-east was first inhabited by Picts, who may or may\r\nnot have been Iberians, and that after the Picts came the Celts; but\r\nsome critics hold that the Picts were only earlier Celts. In any case\r\nthe Stone Age was succeeded by the Bronze Age, when Bronze took the\r\nplace of Stone in the formation of weapons. The Celts made their way\r\nthrough Central France to Britain and ultimately to Scotland. Unlike\r\nthe people they found in possession of Scotland, they were tall (5\r\nft. 9 in.) These are the ancestors of the Gaelic speaking people of\r\nScotland. They are supposed to have amalgamated to some extent with\r\nthe Neolithic men whom they found on the spot, and it is certain that\r\nthey were christianised at an early period. Later on Teutonic tribes,\r\ntall, longheaded and fairhaired men crossed from the Baltic to Britain\r\nand in due course they too reached Aberdeenshire. But up to the time of\r\nDavid I (1124-1153) the population and institutions of the north-east\r\nwere entirely Celtic. The Saxon or Teutonic element was introduced\r\nby way of the coast and the trading towns. From the towns it spread\r\nto the country districts. When Henry II expelled the Flemish traders\r\nfrom England many migrated to the north and formed settlements in many\r\nparts of the country, establishing trade and handicraft, particularly\r\nweaving, and reclaiming waste land. The defeat of Comyn, the Earl of\r\nBuchan, by Bruce in 1308, when Bruce harried Buchan from end to end\r\nand spared none, opened the way for lowland immigrants and not only\r\ngave an impetus to Teutonic settlements, but helped to kill out the\r\nCeltic language and the Celtic ways. These immigrants are really the\r\nancestors of the present Aberdeenshire people, but they have been\r\ngreatly modified by absorbing the Celtic population and mixing with it,\r\nfor though reduced by slaughter, and by an exodus to the hills, it had\r\nnot entirely disappeared. Scandinavians from Norway and Denmark also\r\nfound a footing at various periods in this north-eastern region and\r\nthese elements are all blended in the modern Aberdonian. Celt, Saxon,\r\nFleming and Scandinavian came in one after the other and possessed the\r\nland, forming a new people in which all these elements were fused.\r\n\r\nAberdonians are credited with a distinct individuality, partly the\r\nresult of race, partly due to environment. The strain of practicality\r\nin the Teuton toned down the Celtic imagination and warmth of feeling,\r\nand added a certain tincture of the phlegmatic such as is so prominent\r\nin the Dutchman. Hence the cautious “canny” nature of the typical\r\nAberdonian, dreading innovations, resisting agricultural novelties, and\r\ndisliking ecclesiastical changes. They have been described as people\r\n\r\n  Who are not fond of innovations,\r\n  Nor covet much new reformations;\r\n  They are not for new paths but rather\r\n  Each one jogs after his old father.\r\n\r\nThis requires some elucidation. They are far from slothful or\r\nindifferent. They will uphold with zeal the cause they think right, but\r\nthey must first reach assured conviction that it _is_ right. They are\r\nnot swift nor slow to change, but firm.\r\n\r\nThe Celtic population was in fact absorbed, as we have said, but a\r\ncertain contingent betook themselves to the mountains and for long\r\nkept up a warfare of reprisals upon those who had dispossessed them.\r\nThis caused no end of trouble in Aberdeenshire but not without its uses\r\nfor it braced the occupants in the arts of defence and made them alert\r\nand courageous.\r\n\r\nNo less potent a factor in the evolution of the Aberdonian has been\r\nhis struggle with a well-nigh irreclaimable soil. The county is\r\nwithout mineral wealth, and the only outlet for his energy was found\r\nin attacking the boulder-strewn moors and in clearing them for the\r\nplough. To this he set his mind in the eighteenth century with grim\r\ndetermination. Small farmers and crofters by dint of great personal\r\ntoil and life-long self-sacrifice transformed stony tracts of poor\r\nand apparently worthless land into smiling and productive fields. It\r\nis this struggle with a malignant soil, more than anything else, that\r\nhas made the Aberdonian; one triumph led on to another, and to-day the\r\nspirit of enterprise in farming is nowhere more pronounced than in this\r\ndifficult county.\r\n\r\nThe place names are almost entirely Celtic, and even when they appear\r\nto be Saxon they are only Gaelic mispronounced or assimilated to\r\nsomething better known. The parish of King Edward might very plausibly\r\nbe referred to the northern visits paid by the Hammer of the Scots, but\r\nit is really Kinedar, with the Gaelic _Kin_ (seen in Kinnaird, Kintore\r\nand Malcolm Canmore), meaning a head.\r\n\r\nThe county has a distinctive dialect, really imported and originally\r\nuniform with the dialect of the Mearns, and of Northumbria, the dialect\r\nspoken at one time all the way from Forth to Humber. To-day it is\r\ncalled the Buchan Doric and though varying somewhat in different parts\r\nof the county and hardly intelligible in the Highlands of Braemar,\r\nwhere Gaelic still survives, it is a Teutonic speech with a thin\r\ntincture of Gaelic words such as _bourach_, _closach_, _clachan_,\r\n_brochan_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe dialect contains many vocables not found in literary English, such\r\nas _byous_ and _ondeemis_ for extraordinary, but where the words are\r\nEnglish, they are greatly altered. It is characterised by broad, open\r\nvowels; “boots” is pronounced “beets,” “cart” is “cairt,” “good” is\r\n“gweed.” The final _l_ is dropped; “pull” is “pu,” “fall” is “fa.”\r\nFinal _ol_ becomes _ow_; “roll” is made “row,” and “poll” is “pow.”\r\n_Wh_ is always _f_: “white” is “fite” and “who?” (interrogative)\r\nis “fa?” It is rich in diminutives like the Dutch—_a lassie_, _a\r\nbasketie_. The finest embodiment of this striking dialect, giving\r\npermanent life to its wealth of pathos and expressiveness, is Dr\r\nWilliam Alexander’s _Johnny Gibb of Gushetneuk_.\r\n\r\n_Scots wha hae_, which is supposed to be a characteristic phrase\r\ncommon to all the dialects, would be in Buchan—_Scots at hiz_, which\r\nis largely Norse. “The quynie coudna be ongrutten” is Buchan for “The\r\nlittle girl could not help crying.”\r\n\r\nThe population of the county which a hundred years before was 121,065\r\nin 1901 was 304,439. Since the county contains 1970 square miles this\r\nbrings out an average of 154 to the square mile—just a little over\r\nthe average of Scotland as a whole, but as Aberdeen city accounts for\r\nmore than half of the total, and towns like Peterhead and Fraserburgh\r\nbetween them represent 25,000, the figure is greatly reduced for\r\nthe rural districts. The country districts are but thinly peopled,\r\nespecially on the Highland line, and the tendency is for the rural\r\npopulation to dwindle. They either emigrate to Canada, which is a\r\nregular lodestone for Aberdonians, or they betake themselves to the\r\ntowns, chiefly to Aberdeen itself. Except in and around the principal\r\ntown, the county has hardly any industries that employ many hands.\r\nAgriculture is the main employment, and modern appliances enable\r\nthe farmer to do his work with fewer helps than formerly: hence the\r\ndepopulation of the rural districts. The towns tend to grow, the rural\r\nparishes to become more sparsely inhabited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 11. Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the mainstay of the county, and considering the somewhat\r\nuncertain climate, the shortness of the summer and the natural poverty\r\nof the soil, it has been brought to marvellous perfection. The\r\nmountainous regions are necessarily cut off from this industry except\r\nin narrow fringes along the river banks, but in the low-lying area it\r\nis safe to say that every acre of ground worth reclaiming has been put\r\nto the plough. A century ago the industry was rude and ill-organised,\r\nthe county being without roads and without wheeled vehicles, but the\r\nadvent of railways gave an impetus to the farming instinct and an\r\nextraordinary activity set in to reclaim waste land by clearing it\r\nof stones, by trenching, by draining and manuring it. The proprietors\r\nwere usually agreeable to granting a long lease at a nominal rent to\r\nany likely and energetic man who was willing to undertake reclamations\r\nand take his chance of recouping himself for outlays before his lease\r\nexpired. Being thus secured, the farmer or crofter had an incentive\r\nto put the maximum of labour into his holding. He often built the\r\ndwelling-house, and as a rule made the enclosures by means of the\r\nstones, which, with great labour, he dragged from the fields. In this\r\nway a great acreage was added to the arable land of the county, and\r\nthough some of it has fallen into pasture since the great boom in\r\nagricultural prices during the seventies in last century, the greater\r\npart of the reclaimed soil is still in cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe area of the county, exclusive of water and roadways, is 1955\r\nsquare miles, or 1,251,451 acres. Of this exactly one half is under\r\ncultivation, 628,523 acres. When we remember that Scotland contains\r\nsome nineteen million of acres and that only 25 per cent. of this\r\nacreage is arable land, it is apparent that Aberdeen with its 50 per\r\ncent. is one of the most cultivated areas. As a matter of fact it has\r\nby far the largest acreage under cultivation of any Scottish county.\r\nNext to it is Perthshire with 336,251 acres. The uncultivated half\r\nis made up of mountain, moor and woodlands. Part of this is used for\r\ngrazing sheep, as much as 157,955 acres being thus utilised. In the\r\nmatter of woods and plantations the county with its 105,931 acres\r\nstands next to Inverness-shire, which has 145,629. The trees grown are\r\nmostly larch and pine and spruce, but the deciduous trees, or hard\r\nwoods, the beech, elm and ash, are not uncommon in the low country,\r\nmore especially as ornamental trees around the manor-houses of the\r\nproprietors.\r\n\r\nThe crops chiefly cultivated are oats, barley, turnips and potatoes.\r\nWheat is not grown except now and again in an odd field. The climate is\r\ntoo cold, the autumn heat never rising to the point of ripening that\r\ncrop satisfactorily. Oats is the most frequent crop, and Aberdeenshire\r\nis the oat-producing county of Scotland. A fifth of the whole acreage\r\nunder this crop in Scotland belongs to Aberdeenshire. Perth, which\r\nis next, has only one-third of the Aberdeenshire oat-area. Twenty\r\nthousand acres are devoted to barley, only one-tenth of the barley-area\r\nin Scotland. Over seven thousand acres go to potatoes; the southern\r\ncounties have a soil better adapted to produce good potatoes; Forfar,\r\nFife, Perth and Ayrshire excel in this respect and all these give a\r\nlarger acreage to this crop. As regards turnips, however, Aberdeenshire\r\nis easily first. Being a great cattle rearing and cattle feeding\r\ndistrict, it demands a large tonnage of turnip food. It is estimated\r\nthat a million and a half tons of turnips are consumed every year in\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nAs regards cattle and horses the county has first place in Scotland. In\r\n1909 there were 204,490 agricultural horses in the country and of these\r\n31,592 were in Aberdeenshire, while of 1,176,165 cattle it had 168,091.\r\nIt has a quarter of a million sheep, but here it falls behind other\r\ncounties, notably Argyll, which has nearly a million, or one-seventh of\r\nall the sheep in Scotland.\r\n\r\nAberdeenshire is a county of small holdings. No other county has so\r\nmany tenants. Over five thousand of these farm from five to 50 acres,\r\nwhile there are nearly four thousand who farm areas ranging from 50 to\r\n300. This is part of the secret of its success. Earlier, the number\r\nof small farms was greater, the tendency being in the direction of\r\nthrowing several smaller holdings together to make a large farm.\r\n\r\nThe industry has been a progressive one. Up to the Union in 1707\r\ntillage was of the most primitive kind. Sheep-farming for the sake of\r\nexporting the wool had been the rule, but the Union stopped that branch\r\nof commerce. Later on, about the middle of the eighteenth century, the\r\ndroving of lean cattle into England was a means of profit. Meantime\r\nthe system of cultivation was of the rudest. A few acres round the\r\nsteading, called the infield, were cropped year after year with little\r\nmanuring, while the area beyond, called the outfield, was only cropped\r\noccasionally. There was no drainage and enclosures were unknown.\r\nImprovement came from the south. Sir Archibald Grant of Monymusk and\r\nMr Alexander Udny of Udny were pioneers of better things; they brought\r\nlabourers and overseers from the Lothians and the south of England, to\r\neducate the people in new methods of culture. At first a landlord’s, it\r\nby and by became a farmer’s battle; and ultimately in the nineteenth\r\ncentury it was the farmers who did the reclaiming. But the landlords\r\nset a good example by sowing grasses and turnips.\r\n\r\nNear Aberdeen, a boulder-strewn wilderness was converted into fertile\r\nfields. The town feued the lands and the feuars cleared away the\r\nstones, which they sold and shipped to London for paving purposes; the\r\nprocess of clearing cost as much as £100 an acre, a fourth of this\r\nbeing recovered by the sale of the stones. This is typical of what was\r\ndone elsewhere. Gradually the bleak moors were absorbed. A famine in\r\n1782 opened the eyes of all concerned. Hitherto there was not as much\r\nas 200 acres in turnips. Hitherto also the heavy work-oxen, ten or\r\ntwelve of them dragging a primitive and shallow plough, at a slow pace\r\nand in a serpentine furrow, had been imported from the south. Now they\r\nbegan to be bred on the spot. By and by cattle grew in numbers; by and\r\nby, two horses superseded the team of oxen in the plough.\r\n\r\nBut the chief factor in evolving Aberdeenshire into a cattle-rearing\r\nand beef-producing county was the turnip. Till turnips began to be\r\ngrown in a large acreage, no provision was possible for the cattle in\r\nwinter. Hence the beasts had to be disposed of in autumn. In 1820, as\r\nmany as 12,000 animals were sent in droves to England. The advent of\r\nsteam navigation in 1827 ended the droving. Then began the trade in fat\r\ncattle, but it was years before the county gained its laurels as the\r\nchief purveyor of “prime Scots” and the roast beef of Old England. The\r\nturnip held the key of the position; but turnips will not grow well\r\nwithout manure. The canal between Aberdeen and Inverurie carried great\r\nquantities of crushed bones and guano to raise this important crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aberdeen-Angus Bull]\r\n\r\nCattle-breeding began with M^cCombie of Tillyfour and the Cruickshanks\r\nof Sittyton, one with the native black-polled cattle—the\r\nAberdeen-Angus—and the others with shorthorns. By dint of careful\r\nselection, great progress was made in improving not only the symmetry\r\nof the beasts but their size and beefy qualities. There began a furore\r\nfor cattle-rearing and prizes taken at Smithfield made Aberdeen famous.\r\nRailway transit came in as an additional help, and to-day the Christmas\r\nmarket never fails to give its top prices for Aberdeenshire beef.\r\n\r\nEvery year the beef of 60,000 cattle leaves the county for the\r\nsouthern markets, chiefly London; this in addition to supplying local\r\nneeds, and Aberdeen has now 162,000 of a population. Cattle-rearing\r\nand cattle-feeding are therefore at the backbone of Aberdeenshire\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nA recent development is the export of pure-bred shorthorns to America,\r\nmore especially the Argentine Republic, for breeding purposes. As much\r\nas £1000 has been given for a young bull, in this connection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aberdeen Shorthorn Bull]\r\n\r\nIn the matter of fruit culture, Aberdeen is far behind Perthshire\r\nand Lanark, which have a richer soil and a superior climate. But the\r\nAberdeen strawberries, grown mostly on Deeside, are noted for size\r\nand flavour. In 1909 only 219 acres were devoted to this crop. The\r\ncultivation of raspberries, which is so great a feature of lower\r\nPerthshire, has made only a beginning in Aberdeen, and the small\r\nprofits that have come to southern growers of this crop in recent years\r\nhave acted as a deterrent, in its extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. The Granite Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAberdeen has long been known as “The Granite City.” It is built of\r\ngranite, chiefly from its great quarries at Rubislaw. The granite is\r\na light grey, somewhat different in texture and grain from another\r\ngrey granite much in vogue, that of Kemnay on Donside. There are many\r\nquarries in the county, and each has its distinctive colouring. The\r\nPeterhead stone is red; Corrennie is also red but of a lighter hue. The\r\ngranite industry has made great strides of recent years. The modern\r\nappliances for boring the rock by steam drills, the use of dynamite and\r\nother explosives for blasting, as well as the devices for hoisting and\r\nconveying stones from the well of the quarry to the upper levels by\r\nmeans of Blondins have all revolutionised the art of quarrying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Granite Quarry, Kemnay]\r\n\r\nIt was long before Aberdeen people realised the value of the local\r\nrocks for building purposes. The stone used in the early ecclesiastical\r\nbuildings was sandstone, which was imported by sea from Morayshire\r\nand the Firth of Forth. The beginnings of St Machar Cathedral and the\r\nold church of St Nicholas as well as the church of Greyfriars, built\r\nearly in the sixteenth century and recently demolished, were all of\r\nsandstone. Not till the seventeenth century was granite utilised. At\r\nfirst the surface stones were taken, then quarrying began about 1604,\r\nbut little was done till 1725. Between 1780 and 1790 as many as 600 men\r\nwere employed in the Aberdeen quarries. Great engineering works such\r\nas the Bell Rock Lighthouse, the Thames Embankment, the foundations\r\nof Waterloo Bridge, the Forth Bridge and London Bridge, where great\r\ndurability and solidity are necessary, were made possible by the use\r\nof huge blocks from Aberdeenshire. The polishing of the stone made a\r\nbeginning in 1820, and now a great export trade in polished work for\r\nstaircases, house fronts, façades, fountains and other ornamental\r\npurposes is carried on between the county and America as well as the\r\nBritish Colonies.\r\n\r\nApart from building purposes, granite slabs are largely used for\r\nheadstones in graveyards. This monumental department employs a great\r\nnumber of skilled workmen. There are over 80 granite-polishing yards\r\nin Aberdeen. Here too the modern methods of cutting and polishing the\r\nstones by machinery and pneumatic tools have greatly reduced the manual\r\nlabour as well as improved the character of the work. Unfortunately the\r\nexport trade in these monumental stones has somewhat declined owing to\r\nprohibitive tariffs. In 1896 America took £55,452 worth of finished\r\nstones; in 1909 the value had fallen to £38,000. The tariffs in France\r\nhave also been against the trade, but an average of nearly 10,000 tons\r\nis sent to continental countries. Strangely enough, granite in the raw\r\nstate is itself imported to Aberdeen. Swedish, Norwegian and German\r\ngranites are brought to Aberdeen, to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Granite Works, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nbe shaped and polished. These have a grain and colouring absolutely\r\ndifferent from what is characteristic of the native stone, and the\r\ntaste for novelty and variety has prompted their importation. In 1909\r\nas much as 27,308 tons were imported in this way. Celtic and Runic\r\ncrosses, recumbent tombs, and statuary are common as exports.\r\n\r\nThe stone is also used for the humbler purpose of street paving and is\r\nshipped to London and other ports in blocks of regular and recognised\r\nsizes. These are called “setts,” and of them 30,000 tons are annually\r\ntransmitted to the south. Stones of a larger size are also exported for\r\nuse as pavement kerbs.\r\n\r\nThe presence of quarries is not so detrimental to the atmosphere and\r\nthe landscape as coal mines, and yet the heaps of _débris_, of waste\r\nand useless stone piled up in great sloping ridges near the granite\r\nquarries, are undoubtedly an eyesore. To-day a means has been found\r\nwhereby this blot on the landscape is partially removed. The waste\r\n_débris_ is now crushed by special machinery into granite meal and\r\ngravel, and used as a surface dressing for walks and garden paths—a\r\npurpose it serves admirably, being both cleanly and easily dried. Not\r\nonly so but great quantities of the waste are ground to fine powder,\r\nand after being mixed with cement and treated to great pressure become\r\nadamant blocks for pavements. These adamant blocks have now superseded\r\nthe ordinary concrete pavement just as it superseded the use of solid\r\ngranite blocks and Caithness flags. This ingenious utilisation of the\r\nwaste has solved the problem which was beginning to face many of the\r\nlarger quarries, namely, how they could dispose of their waste without\r\nburying valuable agricultural land under its mass.\r\n\r\nGranite is the only mineral worthy of mention found in the county.\r\nLimestone exists in considerable quantities here and there, but as a\r\nrule it is too far from the railway routes to be profitably worked. It\r\nis, however, burned locally and applied to arable land as a manure.\r\nIn the upper reaches of Strathdon, lime-kilns are numerous. By means\r\nof peat from the adjoining mosses the limestone was regularly burned\r\nhalf a century ago. To-day the practice is dwindling. A unique mineral\r\ndeposit called Kieselguhr is found in considerable quantity in the\r\npeat-mosses of Dinnet, on Deeside. It is really the fossil remains of\r\ndiatoms, and consists almost entirely of silica with a trace of lime\r\nand iron. When dried it is used as a polishing powder for steel, silver\r\nand other metals; but its chief use is in the manufacture of dynamite,\r\nof which it is the absorbent basis. It absorbs from three to four times\r\nits own weight of nitro-glycerine, which is the active property in\r\ndynamite. As found in the moss it is a layer two feet thick of cheesy\r\nlight coloured matter, which is cut out into oblong pieces like peats.\r\nWhen these are dried, they become lighter in colour and ash-like in\r\ncharacter. The Dinnet deposits are the only deposits of the kind in\r\nthe country. Inferior beds are found in Skye. The industry employs 50\r\nhands during the summer months, and has been in operation for 28 years.\r\nThe beds show no sign of exhaustion as yet, and the demand for the\r\nsubstance is on the increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 13. Other Industries. Paper, Wool, Combs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe industries apart from agriculture, work in granite, and the\r\nfisheries are mostly concentrated in and around the chief city. These,\r\nalthough numerous, are not carried on in a large way, but they are\r\nvaried; and there is this advantage in the eggs not being all in one\r\nbasket that when depression attacks one trade, its effect is only\r\npartial and does not affect business as a whole. Paper, combs, wool,\r\nsoap are all manufactured. The first of these engages four large\r\nestablishments on the Don and one on the Dee at Culter. Writing paper\r\nand the paper used for the daily press and magazines as well as the\r\ncoarser kinds of packing paper are all made in considerable quantity.\r\nEsparto grass and wood pulp are imported in connection with this\r\nindustry. Comb-making is also carried on, and the factory in Aberdeen\r\nis the largest of its kind in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nTextile fabrics are still produced, but the progress made in these is\r\nnot to be compared with the advances made in the south of Scotland,\r\nwhere coal is cheap. Weaving was introduced at an early period by\r\nFlemish settlers, who made coarse linens and woollens till the end\r\nof the sixteenth century, when “grograms” and worsteds, broadcloth\r\nand friezes were added. Provost Alexander Jaffray the elder in 1636\r\nestablished a house of correction—the prototype of the modern\r\nreformatory—where beggars and disorderly persons were employed in the\r\nmanufacture of broadcloths, kerseys and other stuffs. A record of this\r\nnovelty in discipline survives in the Aberdeen street called Correction\r\nWynd.\r\n\r\nIn 1703 a joint-stock company was formed for woollen manufactures\r\nat Gordon’s Mills on the Don, where a fulling-mill had existed for\r\ngenerations, and where the making of paper had been initiated a few\r\nyears earlier. The Gordon’s Mills developed the manufacture of cloths\r\nof a higher quality, half-silk serges, damask and plush, and skilled\r\nworkmen were brought from France to guide and instruct the operatives.\r\nTo-day high-class tweeds are made at Grandholm, and such is the\r\nreputation of these goods for quality and durability that in spite of\r\nhigh tariffs they make their way into America, where they command a\r\nlarge sale at prices more than double of the home prices.\r\n\r\nIn the olden days the cloth sold in the home markets was a product\r\nof domestic industry. The farmers’ daughters spun the wool of their\r\nown sheep into yarn, which was sent to county weavers to be made into\r\ncloth. Aberdeenshire serge made in this way was sold at fairs and was\r\nhawked about the county by travelling packmen.\r\n\r\nThe hosiery trade was worked on similar lines. The wool was converted\r\ninto worsted by rock and spindle, and the worsted was knitted into\r\nstockings by the women and girls of the rural population. One man\r\nemployed as many as 400 knitters and spinners. In the latter half of\r\nthe eighteenth century this industry brought from £100,000 to £120,000\r\ninto Aberdeenshire every year. Stockings were made of such fineness\r\nthat they cost 20s. a pair and occasional rarities were sold at four\r\nor five guineas. In 1771 twenty-two mercantile houses were engaged in\r\nthe export trade of these goods, which went chiefly to Holland. The\r\nmerchants attended the weekly markets and country fairs, where they\r\npurchased the products of the knitters’ labour. Such work provided a\r\nsource of income to the rural population and was indirectly the means\r\nof increasing the number of small holdings. These were multiplied\r\nof set purpose to keep the industrious element in the population\r\nwithin the county. The invention of the stocking-frame together with\r\nthe dislocation of trade due to the Napoleonic wars made the trade\r\nunremunerative and it came to an end with the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe linen trade began in 1737 at Huntly, where an Irishman under the\r\npatronage and encouragement of the Duke of Gordon manufactured yarn\r\nand exported it to England and the southern Scottish towns. Silk\r\nstockings were also made there. By and by linen works sprang up on the\r\nDon at Gordon’s Mills and Grandholm as well as within Aberdeen itself.\r\nThe linen trade in the form of spinning and hand-loom weaving was\r\ncarried on in most of the towns and villages of the county and several\r\nnew villages grew up in consequence, such as Cuminestown, New Byth,\r\nStrichen, New Pitsligo, Stuartfield and Fetterangus, in some of which\r\nthe manufacture is continued on a small scale to this day. Much flax\r\nwas grown in the county for a time to minister to this industry, but\r\ngradually the crop disappeared as fibre of better quality was imported\r\nfrom Holland. Yet the spinning of linen yarn was widely practised as a\r\ndomestic industry when the woollen trade declined, and every farmer’s\r\ndaughter made a point of spinning her own linen as the nucleus of her\r\nfuture house-furnishings. The linen trade, except as regards coarser\r\nmaterials such as sacking, has decayed. There is still a jute factory\r\nin Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nAnother industry which employs a large number of hands is the\r\npreserving of meat, fish, fruit, and vegetables. There are several\r\nof these preserving works in Aberdeen. Dried and smoked haddocks,\r\nusually called “Finnan Haddies,” from the village of Findon on the\r\nKincardineshire coast, are one of the specialities of Aberdeen. They\r\nhad at one time a great vogue, and are still largely in demand though\r\nthe quality has fallen off by the adoption of a simpler and less\r\nexpensive method of treatment.\r\n\r\nShip-building is another industry long established at Aberdeen. In the\r\ndays before iron steamships, fleets of swift-sailing vessels known\r\nas “Aberdeen Clippers” were built on the Dee and made record voyages\r\nto China in the tea trade and to Australia. The industry of to-day\r\nis concerned, for the greater part, with the building of trawlers\r\nand other fishing craft, but occasionally an ocean going steamer is\r\nlaunched. The trade is meantime suffering from depression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making smoked haddocks, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nOther industries well represented are soap and candle making, coach\r\nand motor-car building, iron-founding and engineering, rope and twine\r\nmaking, the manufacture of chemicals, colours and aerated waters.\r\nBesides, Aberdeen is a great printing centre and many of the books\r\nissued by London publishers are printed by local presses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 14. Fisheries.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last quarter of a century the fishing industry has made\r\ngreat strides, the value of fish landed in Scotland having more than\r\ndoubled in that period. Nowhere has the impetus been more felt than\r\nin Aberdeenshire, which now contributes as much as one-third of the\r\nwhole product of Scotch fisheries. Since 1886 the weight of fish caught\r\nround the Scottish coast has increased from five million hundredweights\r\nto over nine millions, while the money value has risen in even a\r\ngreater proportion from £1,403,391, to £3,149,127. To these totals\r\nAberdeen alone has contributed over a hundred thousand tons of white\r\nfish (excluding herrings), valued at over a million pounds sterling.\r\nPeterhead and Fraserburgh are also contributors especially as regards\r\nherrings, the former landing 739,878 hundredweights and Fraserburgh\r\nvery nearly a similar quantity. These three ports amongst them\r\naccount for one half of all the fish landed at Scottish ports. When\r\nwe consider the number of persons collaterally employed in handling\r\nthis enormous quantity of merchandise, the coopers, cleaners, packers,\r\nbasket makers, boat-builders, makers of nets, clerks and so on, apart\r\naltogether from the army of fishermen employed in catching the fish, we\r\nsee how far-reaching this industry is, not merely in increasing the\r\nfood-supply of the country but in providing profitable employment for\r\nthe population. At Aberdeen, it is estimated, 13,512 persons are so\r\nemployed and at the other two ports combined, almost a similar number.\r\n\r\nThere are two great branches of the fishing industry—herrings and\r\nwhite fish. The herrings are caught for the most part, though not\r\nexclusively, in the summer, July being the great month. They are\r\ncaptured with nets mostly by steam-drifters as they are called, but\r\nalso to some extent by the ordinary sailing boats of a smaller size\r\nthan the drifters. Fraserburgh and Peterhead land in each case double\r\nthe weight of herrings that come to Aberdeen. In recent years a\r\nbeginning has been made in May and June with gratifying success, but\r\nJuly and August give the maximum returns. Later on in the year, when\r\nthe shoals have moved along the coast southwards, the herring fleets\r\nfollow them thither, to North Shields and Hartlepool, to Yarmouth and\r\nLowestoft; and bands of curers, coopers and workers migrate in hundreds\r\nfrom one port to another, employing themselves in curing the fish. The\r\nbulk of the herrings are cured by salting, and are then exported to\r\nGermany and Russia, where they are much in demand.\r\n\r\nEven more important is the white fishing. Aberdeen is here pre-eminent,\r\nbeing perhaps the most important fishing centre in the world. The total\r\ncatch for Scotland in 1909 was short of three million hundredweights,\r\nof which Aberdeen with its large fleet of trawlers and steam-liners\r\naccounted for 67 per cent. The most important of the so-called round\r\nfish is the haddock, of which over a million hundredweights are landed\r\nin Scotland, Aberdeen contributing the lion’s share, three-fourths of\r\nthe whole. Next to the haddock comes the cod, of which nearly three\r\nhundred and forty thousand hundredweights were handled in the Aberdeen\r\nfish market. The next fish is ling, and then come whitings, saithe,\r\ntorsk, conger-eels. The flat-fish are also important, plaice, witches,\r\nmegrims, halibut, lemon soles and turbot. This last is the scarcest and\r\nmost highly prized of all flat fish, and commands a price next to that\r\ngiven for salmon. Ling and halibut are still mostly caught by hook and\r\nline; the turbot and the lemon sole on the other hand are distinctively\r\nthe product of the trawl net and were little known until trawling was\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nA certain small percentage of this great weight of fish is consumed\r\nlocally, but the great bulk of it is packed in ice and dispatched by\r\nswift passenger trains to the southern markets. The Aberdeen fish\r\nmarket, extending for half a mile along the west and north sides of the\r\nAlbert Basin (originally the bed of the Dee) is the property of the\r\nTown Corporation and is capable of dealing with large catches. As much\r\nas 760 tons of fish have been exposed on its concrete floor in a single\r\nday. In the early morning the place is one of the sights of the city,\r\nwith the larger fish laid out in symmetrical rows on the pavement, and\r\nthe smaller fish—haddocks, whiting and soles—in boxes arranged for\r\nthe auction sale at 8 a.m.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the fishing craft are still sailing vessels, but\r\nsteam-drifters and motor-boats and steam-trawlers\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fish Market, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nare gradually driving the ordinary sail-boats from the trade, just as\r\nthe trawl net is superseding the old-fashioned mode of fishing with\r\nset lines. Still about 86 per cent. of the number of boats employed is\r\nmade up of sailing vessels, but the tonnage is relatively small. The\r\nquantity of fish caught by hook and line is only one-tenth of the whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fishwives, The Green, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North Harbour, Peterhead]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Herring boats at Fraserburgh]\r\n\r\nThe amount of capital invested in boats and fishing gear for all\r\nScotland is estimated by the Fishery Board at over £5,000,000. Of this\r\ntotal, Aberdeenshire claims very nearly two millions. It is now the\r\ncase that the value of fish discharged at the fish market of Aberdeen\r\nis as great as the yearly value of the agricultural land of the whole\r\ncounty—truly a marvellous revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fishing Fleet going out, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nThe herring fishery was prosecuted off the Scottish coast by the Dutch,\r\nlong before the Scotch could be induced to take part in it. Many futile\r\nattempts were made to exploit the industry but little came of them\r\ntill the nineteenth century. A beginning was made at Peterhead in 1820\r\nand at Fraserburgh a little earlier. Aberdeen followed in 1836 but no\r\ngreat development took place till 1870. The first trawler came on the\r\nscene in 1882; to-day there are over 200 local vessels of this type\r\nbesides many from other ports.\r\n\r\nThe salmon fishery has long been famous and at one time was relatively\r\na source of much greater revenue than at present. It still yields a\r\nconsiderable annual surplus to the Corporation funds, but has been\r\neclipsed by the growth of other fisheries. The rateable value of the\r\nsalmon fishings on the Dee is nearly £19,000; those of the other salmon\r\nrivers—the Don, Ythan and Ugie—being much less. The fish are caught\r\nby fixed engines in the sea—stake-nets and bag-nets—set within a\r\nstatutory radius of the river mouth, and by sweep- or drag-nets in the\r\ntidal reaches of the rivers. A good many fish are caught by rod and\r\nline throughout the whole course of the rivers but angling is not the\r\ncommercial side of salmon-fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Shipping and Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nAberdeenshire has practically but three ports—Fraserburgh, Peterhead\r\nand Aberdeen. The herring fishing with its concomitant activities\r\nabsorbs the energies of the two former so far as shipping is concerned,\r\nbut Aberdeen having to serve a larger and wider area than these two\r\nnorthern burghs has developed a range of docks of considerable extent\r\nand importance. During the last forty years the Harbour Commissioners\r\nhave spent £3,000,000 in improving the harbour, increasing the\r\nwharfage, adding break-waters, diverting the course of the Dee,\r\ndeepening the entrance channel, forming a graving dock and so forth.\r\nStill, in spite of these outlays, Aberdeen, which has been a port\r\nfor centuries, has hardly grown in shipping proportionately to its\r\ngrowth in other respects. The reason is that, except fish, granite and\r\nagricultural products, the city has nothing of much moment to export.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: At the docks, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nExclusive of fishing vessels the tonnage of home and foreign going\r\nvessels was in 1882, 587,173; in 1909 it had advanced to over a\r\nmillion, hardly doubling itself in 27 years. While its imports have\r\ngone up from 522,544 tons in 1882 to 1,165,060 in 1909, the exports\r\nhave made only a very slight advance. The chief export is herrings, and\r\nlast year nearly 100,000 tons of these, salted and packed in barrels,\r\nwere sent by sea. The fresh fish are dispatched by rail. Stones in\r\nthe form of granite, either polished for monumental purposes or in\r\nsetts and kerbs for paving, account for 50,000 tons. The remainder (of\r\n210,554 tons) is made up by oats, barley, oatmeal, paper, preserved\r\nprovisions, whisky, manures, flax and cotton fabrics, woollen cloth,\r\ncattle and horses, butter and eggs, salmon and pine-wood.\r\n\r\nThe trade is mostly a coasting trade and more an import than an export\r\none. Coal is the chief article of import, 600,000 tons being discharged\r\nin a year. Besides coal, esparto grass, wood-pulp and rags for\r\npaper-making, foreign granite in the rough state sent to be polished,\r\nflour, maize, linseed, the horns of cattle used for comb-making, and\r\nthe salt used in fish-curing, are the chief materials landed on the\r\nAberdeen quays. Aberdeen being the distributing centre for the county,\r\nand all the railway routes focussing in it, the coal and the building\r\nmaterials not produced in the district, such as lime, slate and cement,\r\nall pass this way, while the tea and sugar, the tobacco and other\r\narticles of daily use, also arrive mostly by the harbour.\r\n\r\nThere are regular lines of steamers between Aberdeen and the following\r\nports: London, Newcastle, Hull, Liverpool, Glasgow and Leith, as also\r\nwith continental towns such as Hamburg, Rotterdam and Christiania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. History of the County.\r\n\r\n\r\nStanding remote from the centre of the country, Aberdeenshire has not\r\nbeen fated to figure largely in general history. The story of its own\r\nevolution from poverty to prosperity is an interesting one, but it is\r\nonly now and again that the county is involved in the main current of\r\nthe history of Scotland.\r\n\r\nIf the Romans ever visited it, which is highly doubtful, they left\r\nno convincing evidence of their stay. Of positive Roman influence\r\nno indication has survived, and no conquest of the district can\r\nhave taken place. The only records of the early inhabitants of the\r\ndistrict—usually called Picts—are the Eirde houses, the lake\r\ndwellings or crannogs, the hill forts or duns, the “Druidical” circles\r\nand standing stones and the flint arrow-heads, all of which will be\r\ndealt with in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nChristianity had reached the south of Scotland before the Romans left\r\nearly in the fifth century. The first missionary who crossed the Mounth\r\nwas St Ternan, whose name survives at Banchory-Ternan on the Dee,\r\nthe place of his death. St Kentigern or St Mungo, the patron saint\r\nof Glasgow, had a church dedicated to him at Glengairn. St Kentigern\r\nbelonged to the sixth century, and was therefore a contemporary of\r\nSt Columba, who christianised Aberdeenshire from Iona. In this way\r\ntwo great currents met in the north-east. Columba accompanied by his\r\ndisciple Drostan first appeared at Aberdour on the northern coast.\r\nFrom Aberdour he passed on through Buchan, and having established the\r\nMonastery of Deer and left Drostan in charge, moved on to other fields\r\nof labour. His name survives in the fishing village of St Combs. He\r\nis the tutelar saint of Belhelvie, and the churches of New Machar and\r\nDaviot were dedicated to him. These facts indicate the mode in which\r\nPictland was brought under the influence of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe next historical item worthy of mention is the ravages of the\r\nScandinavian Vikings. The descents on the coast of these sea-rovers\r\nwere directed against the monastic communities, which had gathered\r\nsome wealth. The Aberdeenshire coast, having few inlets convenient for\r\nthe entry of their long boats, was to a large extent exempt from their\r\nraids, but in 1012 an expedition under Cnut, son of Swegen, the king of\r\nDenmark, landed at Cruden Bay.\r\n\r\nAnother fact of interest is the death of Macbeth, who for seventeen\r\nyears had by the help of Thorfinn, the Scandinavian (whose name\r\nmay be seen in the Deeside town of Torphins), usurped the kingship\r\nof Scotland. Malcolm Canmore led an army against him in 1057, and\r\ngradually driving him north, beyond the Mounth, overtook him at\r\nLumphanan. There Macbeth was slain. A Macbeth’s stone is said to mark\r\nthe place where he received his death-wound, and Macbeth’s Cairn is\r\nmarked by a clump of trees in the midst of cultivated land. The farm\r\ncalled Cairnbethie retains the echo of his name. Kincardine O’Neil,\r\nwhere Malcolm awaited the result of the conflict, commands the ford of\r\nthe Dee on the ancient route of travel from south to north across the\r\nCairn-o-Mounth.\r\n\r\nMalcolm shortly after passed through Aberdeenshire at the head of an\r\nexpedition against the Celtic population which had supported Macbeth.\r\nThe Norman Conquest, nine years thereafter, was the occasion of\r\nAnglo-Saxon settlements in the county. The court of Malcolm and Queen\r\nMargaret became a centre of Anglo-Saxon influence. The old Gaelic\r\nlanguage gave way before the new Teutonic speech. The Celtic population\r\nmade various attempts to recover the power that was fast slipping from\r\ntheir hands. Malcolm headed a second expedition to Aberdeenshire in\r\n1078, and on that occasion granted the lands of Monymusk and Keig to\r\nthe church of St Andrews. He is said to have had a hunting-seat in the\r\nforest of Mar, and the ruined castle of Kindrochit in the village of\r\nBraemar is associated with this fact.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of Aberdeen is in a charter of Alexander I,\r\ngranting to the monks of Scone a dwelling in each of the principal\r\ntowns—one of which is Aberdeen. A stream of Anglo-Saxons, Flemings and\r\nScandinavians had been gradually flowing towards the settlement at the\r\nmouth of the Dee, where they pursued their handicrafts and established\r\ntrade with other ports. William the Lion frequently visited the town\r\nand ultimately built a royal residence, which after a time was gifted\r\nto the Trinity or Red Friars for a monastery. The bishopric of Aberdeen\r\ndates from 1150.\r\n\r\nEdward I of England in 1296 at the head of a large army paid these\r\nnorthern parts a visit. He entered the county by the road leading from\r\nGlenbervie to Durris, whence he proceeded to Aberdeen, exacting homage\r\nfrom the burghers during his five days’ stay. From Aberdeen he went\r\nto Kintore and Fyvie and on to Speyside, returning by the Cabrach,\r\nKildrummy, Kincardine O’Neil and the Cairn-o-Mounth.\r\n\r\nThe next year Wallace, in his patriotic efforts to clear the country\r\nfrom English domination, surprised Edward’s garrison at Aberdeen, but\r\nunable to effect anything, hastily withdrew from the neighbourhood.\r\nEdward was back in Aberdeen in 1303 and paid another visit to Kildrummy\r\nCastle, then in the possession of Bruce. Then Bruce, having fled from\r\nthe English court and assassinated the Red Comyn at Dumfries, was\r\ncrowned at Scone and the long struggle for national independence began\r\nin earnest. In 1307 he came to Aberdeen, which was favourable to his\r\ncause. At Barra, not far from Inverurie and Old Meldrum, his forces met\r\nthose of the Earl of Buchan (John Comyn) and defeated them (1308). It\r\nwas not a great battle in itself, but its consequences were important.\r\nIt marked the turn of the tide in the national cause. The Buchan\r\ndistrict, in which the battle took place, had long been identified with\r\nthe powerful family of the Comyns; and after his victory at Barra,\r\nBruce devastated the district with relentless fury. This “harrying\r\nof Buchan,” as it has been called, is referred to by Barbour as an\r\nevent bemoaned for more than fifty years. The family of the Comyns was\r\ncrushed, and their influence, which had been liberal and considerate to\r\nthe native race of Celts, came to an end. The whole of the north-east\r\nturned to Bruce’s support, and in a short time all Edward’s garrisons\r\ndisappeared. This upheaval created a fresh partition of the lands of\r\nAberdeenshire. New families such as the Hays, the Frasers, the Gordons\r\nand the Irvines, were rewarded for faithful service by grants of land.\r\nThe re-settlement of the county from non-Celtic sources accentuated\r\nthe Teutonic element in the county. After Bannockburn, Bruce rewarded\r\nAberdeen itself for its support by granting to the burgesses the burgh\r\nas well as the forest of Stocket.\r\n\r\nThe great event of the fifteenth century was the Battle of Harlaw,\r\nwhich took place in 1411 at no great distance from the site of the\r\nBattle of Barra. It was really a conflict between Celt and Saxon,\r\nand was a despairing effort on the part of the dispossessed native\r\npopulation to re-establish themselves in the Lowlands. The Highlanders\r\nwere led by Donald of the Isles, who gathering the clansmen of the\r\nnorthern Hebrides, Ross and Lochaber, and sweeping through Moray\r\nand Strathbogie, arrived at the Garioch on his way to Aberdeen. The\r\nburghers placed themselves under the leadership of the Earl of Mar\r\n(Alexander Stewart, son of the Wolf of Badenoch), a soldier who had\r\nseen much service in various parts of the world. The provost of\r\nthe city, Robert Davidson, led forth a body of his fellow-citizens\r\nand joined Mar’s forces at Inverurie, within three miles of the\r\nHighlanders’ camp. The two forces were unequally matched—Donald having\r\n10,000 men and Mar only a tenth of that number, but of these many\r\nwere mail-clad knights on horseback and armed with spears. It was a\r\nfiercely contested battle and lasted till the darkness of a July night.\r\nThe slaughter on both sides was great, but the tide of barbarism\r\nwas driven back. The Highlanders retreated whence they came and the\r\ncounty of Aberdeen was saved from the imminent peril of a Celtic\r\nrecrudescence. This is the only really memorable battle associated\r\nwith Aberdeenshire soil. Its “red” field, on which so many prominent\r\ncitizens shed their life-blood (Provost Davidson and Sir Alexander\r\nIrvine of Drum being of the number), was long remembered as a dreary\r\nand costly victory.\r\n\r\nAnother battle of much less significance was that of Corrichie, fought\r\nin Queen Mary’s reign in 1562 on the eastern slope of the Hill of Fare,\r\nnot far from Banchory. It was a contest between James Stewart (the\r\nRegent Murray, and half-brother of the Queen) and the Earl of Huntly.\r\nHuntly was defeated and slain, and his son, Sir John Gordon, who was\r\ntaken prisoner, was afterwards executed at Aberdeen. Queen Mary, it is\r\nsaid, was a spectator both of the battle and of the execution.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, at the beginning of the Covenanting\r\n“troubles,” Aberdeenshire gained a certain notoriety as being the place\r\nwhere the sword was first drawn. In 1639 the Covenanters mustered at\r\nTurriff under Montrose, to the number of 800. The Royalist party under\r\nthe Earl of Huntly, to the number of 2000 but poorly armed, marched\r\nto the town with the intention of preventing the Covenanters from\r\nmeeting, but they were already in possession, and when Huntly’s party\r\nsaw how matters stood, they passed on, the two forces surveying each\r\nother at close quarters without hostile act or word. This bloodless\r\naffair is known as the first Raid of Turriff. A few weeks later a\r\nsomewhat similar encounter took place, when the Covenanters, completely\r\nsurprised, fled without striking a blow. The loss on either side was\r\ntrifling, still some blood was actually shed, and the Trot of Turriff,\r\nas it was called, became the first incident in a long line of mighty\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nMontrose, both when he was leading on the side of the Covenant,\r\nand later when he became a Royalist leader, paid several visits to\r\nAberdeen, which, although supporting the Royalist cause, suffered\r\nexactions from both parties. In 1644 Montrose made a forcible entry\r\nof the town, which resulted in the death of 150 Covenanters, and in\r\nthe plundering of the city. Later on, after his victory over Argyll at\r\nInverlochy, Montrose gained a success for the Royalist cause at Alford\r\n(1645).\r\n\r\nIn 1650, after the execution of Charles I, his son Charles II landed\r\nat Speymouth, and on his way south to be crowned at Scone, visited\r\nAberdeen, where he was received with every manifestation of loyalty and\r\ngoodwill. The next year General Monk paid the town a visit, and left an\r\nEnglish garrison, which remained till 1659. The Restoration was hailed\r\nwith rejoicing: the Revolution with dislike. Yet at the Rebellion\r\nof 1715 scant enthusiasm was roused for the cause of the Pretender,\r\nwho himself passed through the city on his way from Peterhead to\r\nFetteresso. In the thirty years that passed before the second Jacobite\r\nRebellion, public sentiment had grown more favourable to the reigning\r\nHouse. The ’45 therefore received little support in Aberdeenshire. A\r\nfew of the old county families threw in their lot with the Prince, but\r\nthe general body of the people were averse to taking arms. The Duke\r\nof Cumberland, on his way north to meet Prince Charlie at Culloden,\r\nremained with his army six weeks in the city; when he started on his\r\nnorthward march through Old Meldrum, Turriff and Banff, he left a\r\ngarrison of 200 men in Robert Gordon’s Hospital, lately built but not\r\nyet opened. After Culloden small pickets of troops were stationed in\r\nthe Highland districts of the county, to suppress the practice of\r\ncattle-lifting. Braemar Castle and Corgarff Castle in the upper reaches\r\nof the Dee and the Don still bear evidence of their use as garrison\r\nforts. The problem of dealing with the inhabitants of the higher glens,\r\nwhere agriculture was useless, and where the habits of the people\r\nprompted to raiding and to rebellion, was solved by enlisting the young\r\nmen in the British Army. The Black Watch (42nd) as reorganised (1758)\r\nand a regiment of Gordon Highlanders (1759) were largely recruited from\r\nWest Aberdeenshire, and this happy solution closed the military history\r\nof the district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. Antiquities—Circles, Sculptured Stones, Crannogs, Forts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAberdeenshire is particularly rich in stone-circles. No fewer than 175\r\nof them have been recorded as existing in the district. Unfortunately\r\nmany of them entirely disappeared when the sites were turned to\r\nagricultural uses; others have been mutilated, and owing to the\r\nremoval of some of the stones, stand incomplete; a few have been\r\nuntouched, and from these we may judge what the others were like. One\r\nof the best preserved is that at Parkhouse, a mile south-west of the\r\nAbbey of Deer. A circle of great blocks of stone, irregular and of\r\nunequal height, some standing erect, some evidently fallen down, is the\r\ngeneral feature. Sometimes inside the circle, but more usually in the\r\ncircumference of the circle itself, there is one conspicuously larger\r\nstone, in a recumbent position. This it has been usual to call the\r\nrostrum or altar stone. It is well marked at Parkhouse, being 14 feet 9\r\ninches long, 5 feet 9 inches high, and estimated to weigh 20 tons. The\r\nso-called rostrum is usually on the south side of the circle and the\r\nstones facing it on the north are of smaller size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Cow Wood Cairn Circle; View from the S.W.\r\n\r\nFrom _Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland_, 1903-4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Palaeolithic Flint Implement\r\n(_From Kent’s Cavern, Torquay_.)\r\n\r\nNeolithic Celt of Greenstone\r\n(_From Bridlington, Yorks._)]\r\n\r\nThe size of the circles varies, the largest being over 60 feet in\r\ndiameter, the smaller ones less than 30. Parkhouse measures 50 feet.\r\nThey are found all over the county, in the valley of the Dee, in\r\nthe valley of the Don at Alford, Inverurie and Dyce, as well as in\r\nAuchterless, Methlick, Crimond and Lonmay. The recumbent stone\r\nis invariably a feature of the larger circles. One of the largest is\r\nin the circle at Old Keig in Alford—a huge monolith computed to be 30\r\ntons in weight. Other good examples are at Auchquorthies, Fetternear\r\nand at Balquhain near Inveramsay.\r\n\r\nIn the smaller and simpler circles, there is no recumbent stone, and\r\nthe blocks are of more uniform height.\r\n\r\nWhat the circles were used for is still a matter of dispute. They have\r\nfor long been called “Druidical” circles, and the received opinion\r\nwas that they were places of worship, the recumbent stone being the\r\naltar. But there is no certitude in this view; and, indeed, the fact\r\nthat several exist at no great distance from each other (more than a\r\ndozen are located in Deer) would seem to be adverse to it. They were\r\ncertainly used as places of burying, and some antiquarians hold that\r\nthey were the burying grounds of the people of the Bronze Age. A later\r\ntheory is that they were intended to be astronomical clocks to a people\r\nwho knew nothing of the length of the year, and who had no almanacs to\r\nguide them in the matter of the seasons. The stone-circles, however,\r\nstill remain an unsolved problem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stone at Logie, in the Garioch (4 feet high)\r\nFrom Anderson’s _Scot. in Early Ch. Times_, 2nd Series]\r\n\r\nBesides the circles, Aberdeenshire has another class of archaeological\r\nremains, called sculptured stones. These are of three kinds: (1) those\r\nwith incised symbols only, (2) those with in addition Celtic ornament\r\ncarved in relief, and (3) monuments with Celtic ornament in relief\r\nand no symbols. The first class is the only one largely represented\r\nin Aberdeenshire and a good many representatives are in existence.\r\nThe symbols most commonly seen are the crescent and sceptre, the\r\nspectacles, the mirror and comb, and the so-called “elephant” symbol,\r\na representation of a beast with long jaws, a crest and scroll feet.\r\nAnother is the serpent symbol. What the symbols signify is still a\r\nmystery, but the fact that the stones with symbolism are unusually\r\ncommon in what was known as Northern Pictland seems to point to their\r\nbeing indigenous to that area. Out of 124 stones in the first class\r\nAberdeenshire has 42. It would seem as if the county had been the focus\r\nwhere the symbolism originated. The richness of the locality round\r\nKintore and Inverurie in symbol stones is taken to indicate that region\r\nas the centre from which they radiated.\r\n\r\nAnother form of archaeological remains found in the county is the\r\nEirde or Earth-Houses. These are subterranean dwellings dug out of\r\nthe ground and walled with unhewn, unmortared stones, each stone\r\noverlapping the one below until they meet at the top which is crowned\r\nwith a larger flag-stone, or sometimes with wood. The probability is\r\nthat in conjunction with the underground chambers there were huts above\r\nground, which, being composed of wood, have now entirely disappeared.\r\nAt many points in these earth-houses traces of fire and charcoal are\r\nto be seen, stones blackened by fire and layers of black ashes. In\r\none at Loch Kinnord a piece of the upper stone of a quern as well\r\nas an angular piece of iron was found. It may be inferred that the\r\ninhabitants, whoever they were, were agriculturists, and that the\r\nperiod of occupation lasted down to the Iron Age. Specimens of these\r\nhouses, which usually go by the local name of Picts’ houses, are found\r\nin the neighbourhood of Loch Kinnord on Deeside, at Castle Newe on the\r\nDon, and at Parkhouse, not far from the circle already referred to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “PICTS” OR “EIRDE HOUSE”\r\n  AT\r\n  MIGVIE\r\n  ABERDEENSHIRE\r\n\r\nFrom _Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland_, Vol. V.\r\n1865]\r\n\r\nThe common notion of the purpose of these underground dwellings was\r\nthat they were meant for hiding-places in which the inhabitants took\r\nrefuge when unable to resist their enemies in the open, but if, as has\r\nnow been discovered, they were associated with wooden erections above\r\nground, they could not have served this purpose. On the surface beside\r\nthem were other houses, cattlefolds and other enclosures; once an enemy\r\nwas in possession of these, he could hardly miss the earth-houses.\r\nMoreover, the inhabitants, if discovered, were in a trap from which\r\nthere was no escape. It is more probable that the dwellings were\r\nadjuncts of some unknown kind to the huts on the surface. The fact that\r\npottery and bronze armlets have been unearthed from these underground\r\ncaverns proves that the earth-dwellers had reached a certain\r\nadvancement in civilisation. They reared domestic animals, wove cloth\r\nand sewed it, and manufactured pottery. They used iron for cutting\r\nweapons and bronze for ornament, and must have possessed a wonderfully\r\nhigh standard of taste and manual skill.\r\n\r\nAlong with the earth-houses at Kinnord are found crannogs or\r\nlake-dwellings. Artificial islands were created in the loch by forming\r\na raft of logs, upon which layers of stones and other logs were\r\ndeposited. As fresh materials were added the raft gradually sank till\r\nit rested on the bottom. The sides were afterwards strengthened with\r\nthe addition of stones and beams. In this way was formed what is called\r\nthe Prison Island on Loch Kinnord. In all probability the other island\r\nin the same loch, the Castle Island, may also be artificial, although\r\nit has usually been regarded as natural. Crannogs in pairs—one large\r\nand the other small—occur in several lochs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loch Kinnord]\r\n\r\nA number of hill-forts, more or less disintegrated, are traceable in\r\nthe higher ground in the vicinity of Lochs Kinnord and Davan. These\r\nshow concentric lines of circumvallation, with stronger fortifications\r\nat various points. Vitrified forts, where the stones have been run\r\ntogether by the application of heat, are found at Dunnideer near Insch,\r\nand on the conical summit of Tap o’ Noth near Rhynie. The Barmekin at\r\nDunecht encloses an area of more than two acres, and consists of five\r\nconcentric walls, three of earth-works and two of stone.\r\n\r\nNumerous cairns, barrows or tumuli exist all over the county, at\r\nAberdour on the coast, at Birse, Bourtie, Rhynie, Turriff, and\r\nelsewhere. Human remains have been found in most of these; and as a\r\nrule flint arrow-heads and other implements are also associated with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Architecture—(_a_) Ecclesiastical.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of Scotland from an architectural point of view does not\r\nreach very far back into the past. Till the tide of civilisation flowed\r\ninto Scotland from the south in the eleventh and twelfth centuries,\r\nthere existed in the country no architecture worthy of the name.\r\nWhen the Normans became the ruling power in Britain, they brought\r\narchitectural ideas with them and these superseded the crude attempts\r\nat church building hitherto made. The Scottish churches built under the\r\ninfluence of Columba were simple and rude, consisting of a small oblong\r\nchamber with a single door and a single window. The Norman style, which\r\nobliterated these structures, dates from the twelfth century and, being\r\ncarried along the coast of lowland Scotland, gradually changed the\r\nmanner of building. It is characterised by simple, massive forms and\r\nespecially by arches of a semi-circular shape, sometimes enriched by\r\nzig-zag, and by the use of nook shafts and cushion capitals. Of this\r\nperiod the remains in Scotland are not numerous, and they are very few\r\nin Aberdeenshire. The earliest specimen we can point to is the ancient\r\nchurch of Monymusk, which contains some Norman building incorporated in\r\nthe modern church erected on the old site. Monymusk is on Donside seven\r\nmiles up the river from Kintore. It is a place of great antiquity. The\r\nCuldees first appear there in the twelfth century, and the Earl of\r\nMar built a convent for them on condition that they should submit to\r\ncanonical rule. The lower part of the church tower and the chancel arch\r\nare of the Norman style. The tower has been entirely rebuilt except the\r\nlower doorway, which has a round arch-head with a hood mould enclosing\r\nit. These small fragments suggest that they were part of the convent\r\nerected by the Earl of Mar very early in the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe rounded arch gave place in the thirteenth century to the early\r\nGothic, of which the most striking feature is the pointed arch.\r\nThis is the _First Pointed Period_. Ornament was more general, the\r\nmouldings were richer and more graceful and the foliage of trees\r\nwas occasionally copied. The windows were narrow, lofty and pointed,\r\ngiving an impression of space and lightness. Aberdeenshire is too far\r\nnorth to have developed many examples of this early style, but it has\r\nsome. The Abbey of Deer is perhaps the most ancient ecclesiastical\r\nbuilding, but it is now a complete ruin, all the best parts of it\r\nhaving disappeared within the last fifty years. It was founded in the\r\nthirteenth century. Deer had been an ecclesiastical centre long before\r\nthat time. The story goes that Columba and his pupil Drostan travelled\r\nfrom Iona to Aberdeenshire when Bede was Mormaer (Earl) of Buchan. They\r\nwere first at Aberdour on the coast, but ultimately journeyed to Deer,\r\nwhere Columba requested the Mormaer to grant him a site for a church.\r\nAt first the Mormaer refused, but his son fell ill and in consideration\r\nof the efficacy of the prayers of the two holy men in bringing the\r\nyouth back to health, the Mormaer granted them the lands of Deer and\r\nthis was probably the first place in Aberdeenshire where a regular\r\nChristian church was erected. No trace of that church, built in the\r\nsixth century, is left.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey was an entirely different structure and not begun till early\r\nin the thirteenth century. It was founded by William Comyn, Earl of\r\nBuchan, and was really a Cistercian Abbey, originally occupied by monks\r\nsent from Kinloss. From the ruins now within the grounds of Pitfour\r\nHouse, it can be made out that the length of the building (nave and\r\nchancel) was 150 feet. A few mouldings and the arches of some windows\r\nindicate that it belonged to the first pointed period. The building\r\nwas of red sandstone probably brought from New Byth, some 12 miles\r\ndistant. After the Reformation the Abbey fell to decay and its walls\r\nbecame, as in many other cases, a quarry from which other buildings\r\nwere erected. In 1809 the ruins were enclosed with a wall by the then\r\nproprietor, Mr James Ferguson of Pitfour, but since then they have\r\ndwindled.\r\n\r\nNo mention of Deer is possible without reference to the famous _Book\r\nof Deer_—a manuscript volume of the highest value, emanating not from\r\nthe Abbey but from Columba’s monastery in the same region. The book\r\nwas brought to light in 1860 by the late Mr Henry Bradshaw, University\r\nLibrarian at Cambridge. It had lain unrecognised in the Library since\r\n1715. It contains the Gospel of St John and other portions of scripture\r\nin the writing of the ninth century; but of even greater importance is\r\nthe fact that on its margins it contains memoranda of grants to the\r\nmonastery, made by Celtic chiefs of Buchan and all written in Gaelic.\r\nThese jottings are of the highest historical value.\r\n\r\nSome traces of the Early Pointed style are found in St Machar Cathedral\r\n(the greater part of which, however, is much later). The old church of\r\nAuchindoir close to Craig Castle has a good doorway and other features\r\nof this period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _The Book of Deer_]\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the fourteenth to the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury (1350-1450) is in Scotland the _Middle Pointed Period_. The\r\nwindows were made larger, the vaulting and buttresses less heavy. The\r\nCathedral of St Machar belongs in part to this time. The legend goes\r\nthat St Machar in obedience to the commands of Columba, of whom he was\r\na disciple, journeyed to Scotland and at Old Aberdeen founded a church.\r\nThis church in the twelfth century became the seat of a bishopric\r\nfounded by David I. The original church was superseded probably about\r\n1165, the only relic of this Norman period being part of the abacus\r\nof a square pier. All other traces of earlier work have vanished. In\r\nthe fourteenth century Bishop Alexander Kyninmonth II rebuilt the\r\nnave, partly of red sandstone with foliated capitals of great beauty\r\nand decorated with naturalistic imitation of leafage, one capital\r\nrepresenting curly kail (colewort). The same kind of decoration is seen\r\nin Melrose Abbey. Later on the two impressive western towers, which are\r\nto-day conspicuous objects in the eastern landscape to all travellers\r\nnorthward-bound from Aberdeen, were added. They form a granite mass of\r\nsolid and substantial masonry, and, being finished with machicolation,\r\nparapet-paths and capehouses, were really like a castle in Early\r\nEnglish architecture. Still later on, in the sixteenth century, Bishop\r\nElphinstone, who founded the University of Aberdeen, who built the\r\nfirst Bridge of Dee, and gave a new choir to St Nicholas Church,\r\ncompleted the central tower and placed in it fourteen bells “tuneable\r\nand costly.” The sandstone spires over the western towers were added by\r\nBishop Dunbar early in the sixteenth century, in place of the original\r\ncapehouses. The central tower fell in 1688, crushing the transepts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St Machar Cathedral, Old Aberdeen]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St Machar Cathedral (interior)]\r\n\r\nIn 1560 the government ordered the destruction of the altars, images\r\nand other monuments of the old faith, and this cathedral suffered\r\nwith the rest. It was despoiled of all its costly ornaments and the\r\nchoir was demolished. The roof was stripped of its lead and the\r\nbells were carried off. All that remains to-day is the nave (now the\r\nparish church), a south porch, the western towers and fragments of\r\nthe transept walls, which contain tombs of Bishop Lichtoun, Bishop\r\nDunbar, and others. This is the only granite cathedral in the country,\r\nand, though dating from the Middle and late Pointed periods, has\r\nreminiscences of the Norman style in its short, massive cylindrical\r\npillars and plain unadorned clerestory windows. Another feature is\r\nthe great western window divided by six long shafts of stone. The\r\nfinely carved pulpit now in the Chapel of King’s College is a relic of\r\nthe wood-carvings destroyed in 1649. The whole is extremely plain but\r\nhighly impressive and imposing. Its flat panelled oak ceiling decorated\r\nwith heraldic shields of various European kings, Pope Leo X, and\r\nScottish ecclesiastics and nobility (48 in all) is worthy of mention.\r\nThis heraldic ceiling was restored in 1868-71.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: King’s College, Aberdeen University]\r\n\r\nOf later date is King’s College Chapel, at no great distance from\r\nthe Old Cathedral. It is a long, narrow but handsome building begun\r\nin 1500, shortly after the foundation of the University by Bishop\r\nElphinstone. The chapel and its graceful tower are the oldest parts of\r\nthe College buildings which had originally three towers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: East and West Churches, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nThe surviving one is a massive structure buttressed nearly to the\r\ntop and bearing aloft a lantern of crossed rib arches, surmounted by\r\na beautiful imperial crown with finial cross, somewhat resembling\r\nSt Giles’s in Edinburgh. The difference is that King’s College has\r\nfour ribs while St Giles’s has eight. The whole is of freestone\r\nfrom Morayshire. The entire building is a mixture of Scottish and\r\nFrench Gothic styles, and retains in the large western window the\r\nsemi-circular arch, a peculiarity of Scottish Gothic throughout all\r\nperiods. The canopied stalls and the screen of richly carved oak,\r\nGothic in design and most beautifully handled, take a place among the\r\nfinest pieces of mediaeval carved work existing in the British Empire.\r\nTheir beauty and delicacy, according to Hill Burton, surpass all\r\nremains of a similar kind in Scotland. The chapel contains the tomb\r\nof Bishop Elphinstone. It was once highly ornamented, but meantime is\r\ncovered with a plain marble slab. Its restoration is in prospect.\r\n\r\nSt Nicholas Church, Aberdeen (now the East and West Churches) contains\r\nin its transepts and groined crypt and in its wood-carving, interesting\r\nrelics of twelfth, fifteenth and sixteenth century work. The nave was\r\nrebuilt in the Renaissance style of the time (1755).\r\n\r\nGreyfriars Church, removed a few years ago to make way for the new\r\nfront of Marischal College, was a pre-Reformation church, built by\r\nAlexander Galloway, Rector of Kinkell, early in the sixteenth century.\r\nIts chief features were its range of buttresses and a fine seven-light,\r\ntraceried window.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant churches that succeeded these ancient buildings were\r\ninferior as architecture. It was only in the nineteenth century that\r\ntaste began to revive and some attempt at grace and embellishment\r\nwas made. Architects began to study old styles, and this combined\r\nwith the increasing wealth of the country created a new standard in\r\necclesiastical requirements. To-day our churches tend to grow in\r\narchitectural beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. Architecture—(_b_) Castellated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest fortifications in Scotland were earthen mounds, surrounded\r\nwith wooden palisades. They were succeeded by stone and lime “keeps”\r\nbuilt in imitation of Norman structures. The presence of the Normans\r\nin England during the eleventh and twelfth centuries drove the Saxon\r\nnobility northwards, and they were followed in turn by other Normans,\r\nwho obtained possession of great tracts of country. The rectangular\r\nkeeps of the Normans have in consequence formed the models on which\r\nmost of the Scottish castles were constructed. In the thirteenth\r\ncentury there were castles at Strathbogie, Fyvie, Inverurie and\r\nKildrummy. These have mostly been rebuilt in recent times and the more\r\nancient parts have disappeared. The general idea in them all was a\r\nfortified enclosure usually quadrilateral. The walls of the enclosure\r\nwere 7 to 9 feet thick and 20 to 30 feet high. The angles had round or\r\nsquare towers, and the walls had parapets and embrasures for defence\r\nand a continuous path round the top of the ramparts. The entrance was a\r\nwide gate guarded by a portcullis. The comparatively large area within\r\nthe walls was intended to harbour the population of a district and to\r\ngive temporary protection to their flocks and possessions in times of\r\ndanger. Some of the finer examples, such as Kildrummy, closely resemble\r\nthe splendid military buildings of France in the thirteenth century.\r\nOne of the towers is usually larger than the others and forms the\r\ndonjon or place of strength, to which retreat could be made as a last\r\nresort, when, during a siege, the enemy had gained a footing within the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kildrummy Castle]\r\n\r\nKildrummy Castle is one of the finest and largest in Scotland, and\r\neven in its present ruinous condition gives an impression of grandeur\r\nand extent such as no other castle in Aberdeenshire can rival. It\r\nwas built in the reign of Alexander II by Gilbert de Moravia, Bishop\r\nof Caithness. Situated near the river Don, some ten miles inland from\r\nAlford, and occupying a strong position on the top of a bank which\r\nslopes steeply to a burn on two sides, and protected on the other sides\r\nby an artificial fosse, it was a place of great strength. Its plan is\r\nan irregular quadrangle, the south front bulging out in the centre\r\ntowards the gateway. It had six round towers, one at each angle and\r\ntwo at the gate. One of the corner towers—the Snow Tower—55 feet\r\nin diameter, was the donjon and contained the draw-well. The castle\r\npossessed a large courtyard, a great hall, and a chapel, of which the\r\nwindow of three tall lancets survives. It was built in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and therefore belongs to the First Pointed Period. The stone\r\nused is a sandstone, probably taken from the quarries in the locality,\r\nwhere instead of the prevailing granite of Aberdeenshire a great band\r\nof sandstone occurs.\r\n\r\nThis famous castle passed through various vicissitudes. It was\r\nbesieged in 1306 by Edward I of England and was gallantly defended,\r\nbut, in consequence of a great conflagration, Nigel Bruce, King\r\nRobert’s brother, who was acting as governor, yielded it to the\r\nEnglish, he himself being made prisoner and ultimately executed.\r\nSome of the buildings date from this period, when it was rebuilt by\r\nthe English, but it soon fell into Bruce’s hands again. Twenty years\r\nafter Bannockburn it was conferred on the Earl of Mar. The rebellion\r\nof 1715 was hatched within its walls. Thereafter being forfeited by\r\nMar, it eventually came into the hands of the Gordons of Wardhouse.\r\nRecently it was purchased by Colonel Ogston, who has built a modern\r\nmansion-house close by and crossed the ravine with a bridge, an exact\r\nreplica of the historic Bridge of Balgownie near Donmouth.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century, Scotland, exhausted with the struggle\r\nfor national independence, was unable to engage in extensive building.\r\nBeside, Bruce’s policy was opposed to castle building, as such edifices\r\nwere liable to be captured by the enemy and a secure footing thereby\r\nobtained. His policy was rather to strip the country, and to destroy\r\neverything in front of an invading army, with a view to starving it\r\nout. The houses of the peasantry were made of wood and could easily be\r\nrestored when destroyed. The houses of the nobility took the form of\r\nsquare towers on the Norman model and all castles of the fourteenth\r\ncentury were on this simple plan—a square or oblong tower with very\r\nthick walls and defended from a parapeted path round the top of the\r\ntower. The angles were rounded or projected on corbels in the form of\r\nround bartizans. At first these parapets were open and machicolated. As\r\ntime went on, the simple keep was extended by adding on a small wing\r\nat one corner, which gave the ground plan of the whole building the\r\nshape of the letter =L=. The entrance was then placed as a rule\r\nat the re-entering angle. Such keeps are usually spoken of as built on\r\nthe =L= plan. The ground floor was vaulted and used for stores\r\nor stables and as accommodation for servants. The only communication\r\nbetween this and the first floor was a hatch. In early castles the\r\nprincipal entrance was often on the floor above the ground floor and\r\nwas reached by a stair easily removed in time of danger. Access from\r\none storey to another was by a corkscrew or newel stair at one corner\r\nin the thick wall. Thus constructed a tower could resist siege and\r\nfire, and even if taken, could not be easily damaged.\r\n\r\nOf this kind of keep Aberdeenshire has many excellent examples, the\r\nmost perfect, perhaps, being the Tower of Drum. It stands on a ridge\r\noverlooking the valley of the Dee. To the ancient keep built probably\r\nlate in the thirteenth century was added a mansion-house on a different\r\nplan in 1619. The estate was granted to William de Irvine by Bruce\r\nin recognition of faithful service as secretary and armour-bearer.\r\nPrevious to that, Drum was a royal forest and a hunting-seat of the\r\nking. The keep, which stands as solid and square to-day as it did six\r\nhundred years ago, is quadrilateral and the angles are rounded off.\r\nThe entrance was at the level of the first floor. The main stair is a\r\nnewel. In the lowest storey the walls are twelve feet thick, pierced\r\nwith two narrow loops for light. In a recess is the well. On the top\r\nof the tower are battlements, the parapet resting on a corbel-table\r\ncontinued right round the building.\r\n\r\nHallforest near Kintore is an example of a fourteenth century keep.\r\nIt was built by Bruce as a hunting-seat and bestowed on Sir Robert de\r\nKeith, the Marischal. It still belongs to the Kintore family but is now\r\na ruin.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century brought a change in castle-building. The\r\naccommodation of the keeps was circumscribed and the paucity of rooms\r\nmade privacy impossible. One way of extending the space was, as we\r\nhave said, by adding a wing at one corner. Another mode was to utilise\r\nthe surrounding wall, for the keeps were generally guarded by a\r\nwall, which formed a courtyard or barmekin for stabling and offices.\r\nThis was often of considerable extent and defended by towers. As the\r\ncountry progressed and manners improved, buildings were extended\r\nround the inside of the courtyard walls. In the sixteenth century the\r\nchange went further and developed into the mansion-house built round\r\na quadrangle. The building was first in the centre of the surrounding\r\nwall; ultimately the courtyard was absorbed and became the centre of\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\nBalquhain Castle in Chapel of Garioch, two miles from Inverurie, was\r\noriginally a keep like Drum, but being destroyed in 1526, it was\r\nrebuilt. Very little of it now remains but its massive, weather-stained\r\nwalls have a commanding effect. The barmekin is still traceable. Queen\r\nMary is said to have passed the night prior to the Battle of Corrichie\r\nat Balquhain. It was burned in 1746 by the Duke of Cumberland.\r\n\r\nMany other castles on the same general plan are dotted up and down\r\nthe county. Some are in ruins, some have been altered and added to on\r\nother lines, but the original keep is still a marked feature in most\r\nof them. Cairnbulg—recently restored—on the north-east coast has a\r\nkeep of the fifteenth century with additions of a century later. Gight,\r\nnow ruinous, but formerly celebrated for its great strength, occupies\r\na fine site on the summit of the Braes of Gight, which rise abruptly\r\nfrom the bed of the Ythan. It also is a fifteenth century edifice\r\nbuilt on the =L= plan. It has a historical interest as having once\r\nbelonged to Lord Byron’s mother, from whom it was purchased by the Earl\r\nof Aberdeen. Another of the same kind is Craig Castle in Auchindoir.\r\nIt was completed in 1518 and is also on the =L= plan. So too is\r\nFedderat in New Deer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Old House of Gight]\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century the troubled reign of Queen Mary was\r\nunfavourable to architecture, but towards the end of it the rise of\r\nRenaissance art began to exert a decided influence, especially on\r\ndetails and internal furnishings, and in the next century gradually but\r\ncompletely dominated the spirit of the art. Another influence at work\r\nwas the progress made in artillery. The ordinary castles could not\r\nnow resist artillery fire, and all attempts at making them impregnable\r\nfortresses were abandoned, and the only fortifications retained\r\nwere such as would make the buildings safe from sudden attack. In\r\nconsequence, what had before been grim fortresses were now transformed\r\ninto country mansions, whether on the keep or on the quadrangle\r\nplan; and sites were chosen as providing shelter from the elements\r\nrather than defence against human foes. The Reformation, too, which\r\nsecularised the church lands and gave the lion’s share to the nobility,\r\nwas a notable influence in revolutionising architecture. The nobility\r\nbeing now more wealthy were enabled either to extend their old mansions\r\nor to build new ones. Hence the great development that took place in\r\nthe quiet reign of James VI. The effect of the Union in 1603, which\r\ndrew many of the nobility to England, was civilising and educative, and\r\nraised their ideas of house accommodation as well as their standard of\r\ncomfort and domestic amenity.\r\n\r\nThe change was of course gradual. The old keeps and the castles built\r\nround a courtyard were still in evidence, but picturesque turrets\r\ncorbelled out at every angle of the building, slated, and terminating\r\nin fanciful finials, became the rule. The lower walls were kept plain,\r\nthe ornamentation being lavishly crowded only on the upper parts. The\r\nroofs became high-pitched with picturesque chimneys, dormer windows\r\nand crow-stepped gables. All these features so characteristic of the\r\nmansion-houses of the fourth period (1542-1700) are well marked in\r\nCraigievar, which is one of the best preserved castles of the time. Its\r\nground plan is of the =L= type, but the turrets\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Craigievar Castle, Donside]\r\n\r\nand gables are corbelled out with ornamental mouldings and the upper\r\npart of the castle displays that profusion of sky-pointing pinnacles\r\nand multifarious parapets which mark the period. The same is seen at\r\nCrathes and at Castle Fraser. The last is altogether an excellent\r\nspecimen. It consists of a central oblong building with two towers\r\nat the diagonally opposite ends, one square and the other round, and\r\nis therefore a development into what has been called the =Z= plan or\r\nstepped plan—induced by the general use of firearms in defence. Here,\r\nas at Craigievar, gargoyles originally used to carry off rain water\r\nfrom the roof are brought in as a piece of fanciful decoration, apart\r\nfrom any utilitarian purpose, and project from the walls at places\r\nwhere rain-spouts are irrelevant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crathes Castle, Kincardineshire]\r\n\r\nThe castle has a secret chamber or “lug,” in which the master of\r\nthe house could over-hear the conversation of his guests in the\r\ndining-hall. Nothing could better illustrate the treachery and cunning\r\nwhich had been bred by the difficulty of the times. Mr Skene, the\r\nfriend of Sir Walter Scott, minutely investigated this contrivance as\r\nit exists at Castle Fraser, and no doubt his account of this ingenious\r\nbut dishonourable device for gaining illicit information suggested King\r\nJames’s “Lug,” so happily described in _The Fortunes of Nigel_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Castle Fraser]\r\n\r\nCastellated buildings of this class are so numerous in Aberdeenshire\r\nthat it is possible to name only a few. One of the finest is Fyvie\r\nCastle on the banks of the upper reaches of the Ythan in the very\r\ncentre of the county. It is not like many others a ruin, but a\r\nmansion-house modernised in many respects, but still retaining all\r\nthe picturesque features of the olden time. It occupies two sides of\r\na quadrangle, with the principal front towards the south, one side\r\nbeing 147, the other 137 feet in frontage. At the three corners are\r\nmassive square towers, with angle turrets and crow-stepped gables.\r\nBesides these towers, there are in the centre of the south front two\r\nother projecting towers, which at 42 feet from the ground are bridged\r\nby a connecting arch, eleven feet wide, the whole forming a grand and\r\nmost impressive mass of masonry called the “Seton” tower, a magnificent\r\ncentre to what is perhaps the most imposing front of any domestic\r\nedifice in Scotland. At the south-east corner is the “Preston” tower,\r\nbuilt by Sir Henry Preston, and the earliest part of the building,\r\ndating from the fourteenth century. In the south-west stands the\r\n“Meldrum” tower, so-called from the succeeding proprietors (1440-1596).\r\nThey erected this part and the whole range of the south front except\r\nthe “Seton” tower already referred to, which is a later addition. The\r\nSetons succeeded the Meldrums and it is to Alexander Seton, Lord Fyvie\r\nand Earl of Dunfermline, that the castle owes its greatest splendours.\r\nBesides planning this tower, he ornamented the others with their\r\nturreted and ornate details. He also built the great staircase, which\r\nis a triumph of architectural skill. It is a wheel or newel staircase\r\nof grand proportions, skilfully planned and as skilfully executed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fyvie Castle, South Front]\r\n\r\nThe Gordon tower on the west was not added till the eighteenth century,\r\nby William, second son of the second Earl of Aberdeen. Its erection\r\nnecessitated the destruction of the chapel. Here one may see how the\r\nRenaissance ideas were creeping in, especially the desire for balance\r\nand symmetry. Two of everything was beginning to be the rule. One wing\r\nmust have another to balance with it; one tower another to make a pair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 20. Architecture—(_c_) Municipal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a period of declining taste in architecture, a revival began\r\nearly in the nineteenth century under the guidance of architects of\r\ngenius such as Archibald Simpson and John and William Smith. A great\r\nimprovement was thereby effected in the general aspect of the city\r\nof Aberdeen, and their good work has been enhanced by that of their\r\nsuccessors. It is necessary to repeat that it was long before the local\r\ngranite came to its own. The earlier buildings of importance were\r\nall of sandstone; to-day he would be a bold architect who suggested\r\na sandstone building in Aberdeen. The use of granite exercises an\r\nindirect effect on architectural design. It lends itself to broad,\r\nclassic, monumental and dignified effects, while its stubborn quality\r\nis a check against over-exuberance of detail, and fanciful, gimcrack\r\ntrivialities. The plainness of the buildings was often remarked upon\r\nby strangers twenty years ago. The newer buildings are not without\r\nadornment.\r\n\r\nThe County and Municipal Buildings (or the Town-House as it is\r\nfamiliarly called) on the south side of Castle Street were opened in\r\n1870. They form a magnificent pile which takes a high place amongst\r\nprovincial town-halls, as regards both vigour and originality of\r\ntreatment. The line of elliptical arches on the ground floor and of\r\nsmall arcaded windows in the floor above make an imposing front. The\r\ngreat tower, which rises to a height of 200 feet and dominates the\r\nwhole city, has the castellated turrets which we have seen to be\r\ncharacteristic of Scottish architecture. It is curious to see how\r\nlatter-day architects have not been able to get away from this feature.\r\nIt is conspicuous even in such buildings as the Grammar School and the\r\nnew Post Office. The Municipal tower, if somewhat heavy-looking, is\r\non the whole effective. The small tower and spire on the east is the\r\nold Tolbooth tower, of the seventeenth century, preserved by being\r\nincorporated in the modern building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Municipal Buildings, Aberdeen, and Town Cross]\r\n\r\nThe next public building that should be mentioned is Marischal College,\r\nrecently enlarged at a cost of nearly\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marischal College, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\n£250,000. This is undoubtedly the finest piece of modern architecture\r\nin the north of Scotland, and one of the most handsome and graceful\r\nin the kingdom. The College at the end of the nineteenth century was\r\na work of the Gothic revival occupying three sides of a quadrangle,\r\nwith a tower in the centre of one side. This tower has been remodelled\r\nand greatly heightened so that it is now a rival to the Municipal\r\ntower in the same street. It is known as the Mitchell tower, in\r\ncompliment to the donor, the late Mr Charles Mitchell of Newcastle,\r\nwhose name is also associated with the public or graduation Hall of the\r\nUniversity. The old frontage of Marischal College was a desultory line\r\nof commonplace houses, through which by a narrow gateway entrance was\r\ngained to the quadrangle. These have all been cleared away and now a\r\nstately pile bristling with ornate pinnacles that sparkle in the sun\r\nfills the whole length of 400 feet.\r\n\r\nNo less impressive than the delicately chiselled front is the back\r\nview of the College from West North Street, where a dip in the ground\r\ndisplays to advantage the great mass of building, the Mitchell Hall\r\nwith its great Gothic window, its angle-turrets and lofty buttresses.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Assurance Office stands at the angle between Union Street\r\nand Union Terrace. The clean surface and clear-cut lines of the granite\r\nmasonry are very pleasant to the eye. Union Terrace contains some of\r\nthe best modern buildings in the city—the Grand Hotel, the Aberdeen\r\nSavings Bank, which though very simple is an admirable specimen of a\r\nfront specially designed for granite; the Offices of the Parish Council\r\nand the School Board, original and striking, the Public Library, the\r\nUnited Free South Church with its graceful dome, and His Majesty’s\r\nTheatre—all serve to illustrate the changes that are being rung on\r\ngranite fronts in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between these more ornate buildings and the severely\r\nclassic simplicity of the Music Hall, a square block with a portico\r\nof Ionic pillars, belonging to the early nineteenth century, shows\r\nwhat a change in sentiment has taken place. The feature of all the\r\nAberdeen architecture is the careful, conscientious workmanship, which\r\nalways gives the impression of lasting solidity. The material is so\r\nirresponsive that without hard labour, no effect is produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Union Terrace and Gardens, before widening of Bridge]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grammar School, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nWe can do no more than mention some of the other notable edifices\r\nin the city. The Grammar School, erected in 1863, is a successful\r\napplication of castellated Gothic to a modern building—all the more\r\neffective that it is well set back from the street. The contiguous Art\r\nSchool and Art Gallery are modern buildings, each with an order of\r\ncolumns and a pediment which break the long low line of the façade. The\r\nelliptical arch that unites\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gordon’s College, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nthem gives access to Gordon’s College, the centre portion of which is\r\na piece of sober eighteenth century work. The wings and colonnades\r\nwere added subsequently. The Head Office of the North of Scotland and\r\nTown and County Bank at the top of King Street has its entrance porch\r\nat the angle with a colonnade of pillars. Near it is the Town Cross,\r\na hexagonal erection with Ionic columns and a tapering shaft rising\r\nfrom the centre of the roof, with a heraldic unicorn as terminal. It\r\ndates from the end of the seventeenth century. In the panels of the\r\nbalustrade are half-length portraits of Scottish and British Kings\r\n(including the seven Jameses). It is a fine example\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bridge of Don, from Balgownie]\r\n\r\nof its class and was the work of a local mason. The royal portraits are\r\nreal and authentic. The Ionic screen or façade between Union Street and\r\nthe city churches gives some idea of the severely classic architecture\r\nthat was the vogue in Aberdeen nearly a century ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Bridge of Dee, Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nA word must be said about the chief bridges. Union Bridge has a span\r\nof 130 feet, and was built in 1802 to facilitate the making of Union\r\nStreet. It was originally narrower than the street and has recently\r\nbeen widened to meet the requirements of increased traffic. The Bridge\r\nof Don (Balgownie), probably built early in the fourteenth century if\r\nnot earlier, throws its one Gothic arch over the deep contracted stream\r\nof the river. A small bequest in the seventeenth century for its\r\nmaintenance has been so well husbanded that out of its accumulations\r\nthe cost of the new Bridge (£17,000), and other buildings has been\r\ndefrayed, and the capital value of the fund—called the Bridge of Don\r\nfund—is to-day £26,500. The new bridge, much nearer the sea and with\r\nfive arches, was designed by Telford and completed in 1830. The Old\r\nBridge of Dee (with seven arches) was founded by Bishop Elphinstone and\r\ncompleted in 1527 by Bishop Gavin Dunbar. In 1842 it was widened 11-1/2\r\nfeet. The New (Victoria) Bridge, a continuation of Market Street, was\r\nopened in 1882, since when quite a new and populous city has sprung\r\nup on the south side of the river, entirely eclipsing the old fishing\r\nvillage of Torry which formerly monopolised this side of the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. Architecture—(_d_) Domestic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mansion-houses of the county, whether they are ancient fortalices\r\nmodernised by later additions or entirely modern buildings erected\r\nwithin a century of the present time, deserve more space than can\r\nbe allotted to them here. They are of all types of architecture,\r\nclassical, renaissance, and composite, but there is no doubt that the\r\ncastellated, Scotch baronial, the traditional type so common in the\r\nseventeenth century, still predominates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Balmoral Castle]\r\n\r\nForemost among them must be mentioned Balmoral Castle far up the\r\nvalley of the Dee. Built in 1853 of a light grey granite found in\r\nthe neighbourhood, it is composed of two semi-detached squares\r\nwith connecting wings, and displays the usual castellated towers,\r\nhigh-pitched gables and conical roofed turrets. The massive clock-tower\r\nrising to a height of 100 feet from amongst the surrounding leafage and\r\ngleaming white in summer sunshine forms a pleasing picture. The late\r\nQueen Victoria purchased the estate in 1848, and the Prince Consort\r\ntook a great personal interest in the design the details of which\r\nare said to be modelled on a close study of Castle Fraser, already\r\nreferred to. For more than half a century it has been a royal residence\r\nand though many additions and alterations have been made in that time,\r\nthe general picture of the edifice remains the same to the traveller on\r\nthe Deeside road. Two miles below is Abergeldie Castle, which has been\r\nleased by the Royal Family for many years. Its turreted square tower,\r\nold and plain and somewhat cramped in space, serves as a contrast to\r\nthe more spacious modern mansion.\r\n\r\nThis region of the Dee has many mansions. Invercauld House,\r\nreconstructed in 1875, is in the same manner, its chief feature being\r\na battlemented tower seventy feet high. The situation of Invercauld\r\nat the foot of a high hill and backed by plantations of pine and with\r\na beautiful green terrace stretching to the river Dee is probably\r\nunsurpassed in the district. As seen from the Lion’s Face Rock, a\r\nperpendicular cliff on the south side of the river, this house of the\r\nFarquharsons makes a striking picture not likely ever to be forgotten.\r\nFarther up is Mar Lodge, the residence of the Duke of Fife, in the\r\nhorizontal and English domestic style. It was built so recently as\r\n1898, and replaced a somewhat similar building destroyed by fire.\r\nGlenmuick House, built in 1873, is in the Tudor style, strongly treated\r\nand modified to harmonise with the rugged surroundings. The only other\r\nDeeside mansion we can refer to is Kincardine Lodge, recently built,\r\na very fine building, based to a large extent on the plan of Fyvie\r\nCastle, which we have already referred to as the grandest castellated\r\nmansion-house in the north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cluny Castle]\r\n\r\nDonside is not so well furnished with stately and luxurious\r\nmanor-houses, but it has Castle Newe and Cluny Castle, the\r\nantique-modern Place of Tilliefoure, Fintray House in the Tudor style,\r\nPitmathen in French Renaissance, each in its own way a work of art.\r\nMidway between the two valleys is Dunecht House, which was built for\r\nLord Lindsay, a great authority on Christian art, and of which the\r\nmost striking feature is the great campanile in the Italian manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Haddo House]\r\n\r\nIn the Ythan valley, Haddo House, the residence of the Earl of\r\nAberdeen, Lord Lieutenant of the County, belongs to the period of the\r\nlate English Renaissance, but additions have been made from time to\r\ntime. Crimonmogate, Strichen, and Philorth are classic.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, worthy of mention, that the local masons\r\nhave almost developed a school of craftsmanship, by the thorough\r\nconscientiousness and downright honesty\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Midmar Castle]\r\n\r\nof their work. We have already remarked that Kintore and Inverurie\r\nseemed to be the centre from which the sculptured stones radiated. In\r\nthe same region are the group of castles, Castle Fraser, Craigievar,\r\nMidmar and Cluny (now destroyed), all within an easy radius of the\r\ncentre. Castle Fraser and Midmar were built by a mason called John\r\nBell, whose work was characterised by sterling qualities. The art\r\nwould almost seem to have been handed down through several generations\r\nof craftsmen, for the modern Cluny Castle and Dunecht House, as well as\r\ntheir chapels, besides other palatial and extensive fabrics, were built\r\nentirely by local masons, without any extraneous help. It seems as if\r\nthe building art were indigenous to this particular locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 22. Communications—Roads, Railways.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the chief means of communication between Aberdeenshire\r\nand the south was the old South and North Drove Road, which crosses the\r\nCairn-o-Mounth from Fettercairn in Kincardine, and, passing the Dye and\r\nWhitestones on the Feugh, reaches the Dee at Potarch. It then ran along\r\nthe hill to Lumphanan and on through Leochel to the Bridge of Alford,\r\nthence to Clatt and Kennethmont and along the valley of the Bogie to\r\nHuntly.\r\n\r\nThere was another—a supposed Roman road—which, coming up from\r\nthe direction of Stonehaven, crossed the Dee at Peterculter, and,\r\nproceeding northward through Skene, Kinnellar, Kintore and Inverurie,\r\nwent on to Pitcaple. Thence it passed through Rayne and across the east\r\nshoulder of Tillymorgan to what has been regarded as a Roman camp at\r\nGlenmailen, and by the Corse of Monellie, Lessendrum and Cobairdy, to\r\nthe fords of the Deveron below Avochie.\r\n\r\nAnother ancient road crossed the mountains from Blairgowrie by the\r\nSpittal of Glenshee, over the Cairnwell, Castleton of Braemar, and the\r\nupper waters of the Gairn to the valley of the Avon at Inchrory and\r\nthence by Tomintoul to Speyside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spittal of Glenshee]\r\n\r\nAfter the ’45 General Wade adopted the southern part of this road as\r\nthe line of his great military route from Blairgowrie to Fort George,\r\nbut from Castleton he turned to the east, went down the Dee valley to\r\nCrathie, and thence across the hills to Corgarff in Upper Strathdon\r\nfrom which he reached Tomintoul by the “Lecht.” This route he completed\r\nin 1750.\r\n\r\nThese roads had naturally to lead to fords in the rivers, and, when\r\nbridges came to be built, it was just as natural that they should be\r\nplaced in the line of established routes. When the Bridge of Alford was\r\nbuilt over the Don in 1810-11 and the Bridge of Potarch over the Dee in\r\n1812-13, a new line of road was made across country to connect them. It\r\nwent from Dess through Lumphanan and Leochel to the Don valley.\r\n\r\nThe first turnpike made in Aberdeenshire was the road from the Bridge\r\nof Dee to the city of Aberdeen _viâ_ Holborn Street, which completed\r\nthe northern section of the great post-road between Edinburgh and\r\nAberdeen. This was in 1796.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time was made the North Deeside Road reaching from\r\nAberdeen to Aboyne and thence to Ballater, Crathie, and Braemar, where\r\nit met the Cairnwell Road. Another was the Aberdeen and Tarland route,\r\nwhich went by Skene and Echt with branches joining on to those already\r\nin existence. One of these struck off at Skene, and, crossing the hill\r\nof Tilliefourie, proceeded to Alford. It was afterwards extended up\r\nthe Strath by Mossat, and Glenkindie to Corgarff, where it met General\r\nWade’s road.\r\n\r\nThe great post-road from Aberdeen to Inverness went by Woodside,\r\nBucksburn, Kintore, Inverurie, the Glens of Foudland to Huntly and\r\nCairnie on the boundary of Banffshire. It had branches from Huntly to\r\nPortsoy through Rothiemay and to Banff through Forgue by the Bridge of\r\nMarnoch.\r\n\r\nThe Strathbogie Road from Huntly to Donside by way of Gartly, Rhynie,\r\nand Lumsden joined the Strathdon Road at Mossat. Though by no means the\r\nmost convenient, it is still used as the route along which the mails\r\nare conveyed to Strathdon.\r\n\r\nThe Aberdeen and Banff Road left the post-road at Bucksburn and passing\r\nthrough Dyce, New Machar, Old Meldrum, Fyvie, Turriff, and King Edward\r\nmade for the Bridge of Banff.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern district the most important route was that to Peterhead.\r\nIt crossed the new Bridge of Don, and, passing through Belhelvie,\r\nEllon, and Cruden, came to Peterhead by the coast. From there it went\r\nstraight across country to Banff by Longside, Mintlaw, New Pitsligo,\r\nand Byth, thence over the Longmanhill to Macduff. Later a coast route\r\nwas made connecting Peterhead and Fraserburgh, by way of St Fergus,\r\nCrimond and Lonmay. Another continuation of it was along the coast past\r\nRosehearty, Pennan, Gardenstown and Troup Head into Banffshire.\r\n\r\nIt was only during the nineteenth century that proper and serviceable\r\nhighways were constructed. Prior to that time a few main roads had been\r\nmade but side connections were few and badly kept, so that wheeled\r\nvehicles, if they had existed, would have been a useless luxury. Early\r\nin the eighteenth century wheeled vehicles were absolutely unknown. In\r\n1765 the judges of the Circuit Court of Justiciary first travelled to\r\nAberdeen in chaises instead of on horseback. The first mail coach did\r\nnot arrive till 1798. It took 21 hours between Edinburgh and Aberdeen.\r\nNot till 1811 did passenger coaches begin to ply between Aberdeen and\r\nHuntly. Then only was it possible for the farmer to convey his products\r\nby cart, which superseded the pack-horse as a means of transport.\r\n\r\nThe upkeep of the roads was secured by a system of tolls. Traces of the\r\nsystem still survive in the renovated toll-bar houses, which in some\r\ncases retain a window facing right and a window facing left to mark the\r\napproach of vehicles from either side. Aberdeenshire abolished tolls in\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nThe Railway system reached Aberdeen in 1848. Prior to that time for\r\nfifty years the stage coach plying between Edinburgh and Aberdeen\r\nhad been, apart from the sea-routes, the only bond between this part\r\nof the country and the south. A few years later, in 1854, what is\r\nnow the Great North of Scotland Railway was opened from Aberdeen to\r\nHuntly, and two years thereafter was extended as far as Keith. This\r\nis still the main line of railway in the county. It touches in its\r\ncourse Dyce, Kintore, Inverurie, Insch, and Huntly. By and by branch\r\nlines were constructed forking off from it at various points; _first_\r\nfrom Inveramsay, through Wartle, Fyvie, to Turriff and ultimately\r\nto Macduff; _second_ from Inverurie across country to Old Meldrum;\r\n_third_ from Kintore up Donside by Kemnay and Monymusk to Alford; and\r\nlastly from Dyce through New Machar, Udny, Ellon to New Maud, where it\r\nbifurcates, one fork going on to Peterhead the other to Fraserburgh.\r\nThis is the Buchan and Formartine branch. Recently a sub-branch was\r\nmade from Ellon running to the coast and touching Cruden Bay, its\r\nterminus being at Boddam within half an hour’s distance of Peterhead.\r\nFrom Fraserburgh, a light railway runs to Cairnbulg, Inverallochy and\r\nSt Combs. The only other line of railway in the county is the Deeside\r\nline, which runs up the Dee valley as far as Ballater. It was begun in\r\n1853, and Banchory was the terminus till 1859, when an extension was\r\nmade to Aboyne; then in 1866 it was extended to Ballater.\r\n\r\nThe lack of population and the paucity of goods apart from agricultural\r\nproducts have handicapped the local railways, which are far from\r\nprosperous. The chances of extension in other directions are very\r\nremote. Meantime outlying districts, such as Strathdon and Braemar,\r\nare served by motors. The holiday and tourist traffic during the\r\nsummer months and the influx of sportsmen at the shooting season are\r\ncontributory sources of revenue, but even these show no tendency to\r\ngrow—a state of affairs due to the prevalent use of private motor-cars.\r\n\r\nAberdeenshire has no canals and is never likely to have. Prior to the\r\nadvent of railways a canal, designed by Telford, the great engineer,\r\nwas constructed between Aberdeen and Port Elphinstone on the south side\r\nof Inverurie. It was opened for passenger and goods traffic in 1806,\r\nand continued to serve the district until the steam-engine sounded its\r\nknell. For nearly half a century it was a bond between the chief city\r\nand the centre of the county and, although it never was remunerative\r\nto the promoters, and provided a very slow mode of conveyance, it was\r\nof great public service. The railway line to the north runs parallel\r\nat certain places to the track of this canal, whose superannuated\r\nembankments may still be recognised, after half a century, at various\r\npoints between Aberdeen and Inverurie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 23. Administration and Divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century Scotland was divided into Sheriffdoms, where the\r\nSheriff was the minister of the Crown for trying civil and criminal\r\ncases. The office was hereditary until the rebellion of ’45, when its\r\nhereditary character was abolished. Aberdeenshire has a non-resident\r\nSheriff-Principal (who is also Sheriff of Banff and Kincardine) besides\r\ntwo resident Sheriff-substitutes. These deal with ordinary civil\r\ncases such as debts, as well as with criminal cases involving fine\r\nor imprisonment, but not as a rule involving penal servitude, except\r\nforgery, robbery and fire-raising.\r\n\r\nThe head of the county is the Lord-Lieutenant. Next to him is the\r\nVice-Lieutenant and a large number of Deputy-Lieutenants and Justices\r\nof the Peace, but the chief administrative body is the County\r\nCouncil, which consists of 65 members. These elect the chairman\r\nand vice-chairman, who are designated respectively convener and\r\nvice-convener. County Councils were first established in 1889. The\r\ncounty is divided into districts, and each district has so many\r\ndivisions, or parishes, which elect one councillor. Aberdeenshire\r\nhas 85 parishes, which are grouped in eight districts: (1) Deer with\r\nfifteen electoral divisions, (2) Ellon with seven, (3) Garioch with\r\nsix, (4) Deeside with six, (5) Turriff with seven, (6) Aberdeen\r\nwith nine, (7) Alford with four, and (8) Huntly with four, making\r\nfifty-eight electoral divisions in all. The powers of the Council are\r\nto maintain roads and bridges, to administer the Contagious Diseases\r\n(Animals) Acts, to appoint a medical officer of health and a sanitary\r\ninspector, to deal with the pollution of rivers and to see to the\r\nprotection of wild birds. Previous to the passing of the Act of 1889\r\nthe Commissioners of Supply were the chief governing body. They are\r\nstill retained but have no jurisdiction, except in so far as they\r\nelect members to the Standing Joint Committee. This committee includes\r\nrepresentatives from the County Council appointed annually and from the\r\nCommissioners of Supply, together with the Sheriff _ex officio_. The\r\nStanding Joint Committee has charge of the Police and controls all the\r\ncapital expenditure in the county.\r\n\r\nEach district has a district committee consisting of the county\r\ncouncillors for the divisions of the district and of parish councillors\r\nselected by each parish council of the district. Each parish has in\r\nthis way two representatives on the district committee, one elected\r\nby the electors and the other appointed by the parish council. This\r\ndistrict committee is the local authority for administering the Public\r\nHealth Acts, but has no power to raise money—that being the function\r\nof the County Council as a whole.\r\n\r\nBy a later Act of 1894, a parish council was established in every\r\nparish. The number of councillors in landward parishes is fixed by the\r\nCounty Council and in burghal parishes by the Town Council. The parish\r\ncouncil looks after the Poor Law and must provide for pauper lunatics,\r\nsees to the levying of the school rate, to the administration of the\r\nVaccination Acts, and to the appointment of Registrars.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the county are therefore divided amongst three bodies,\r\nthe County Council, the District Committees and the Parish Councils.\r\nPrior to 1890 the powers of local administration lay with the\r\nCommissioners of Supply, the Road Trustees and the Parochial Boards,\r\nwhose functions are now vested in these other bodies.\r\n\r\nEach parish, besides having a Parish Council, has a School Board,\r\nwhich, since 1872, has administered the education of the parish.\r\nEducation is free and compulsory for all children between the ages\r\nof 5 and 14. The schools are of three types—primary, intermediate,\r\nand secondary. The intermediate schools provide a three years’ course\r\nbeyond the elementary stage, and the secondary schools a further course\r\nlasting for two years.\r\n\r\nThe County Council now takes a certain share in educational\r\nadministration, having powers to allocate grants of money to schools\r\nand bursaries to pupils. The training of teachers, which until recently\r\nwas in the hands of the Churches (Established and United Free), has\r\nnow passed to a Provincial Committee elected by various representative\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nEvery burgh has a Town Council consisting of Provost, Magistrates\r\nand Councillors, who hold their seats for three years. The number\r\nof councillors varies with the size of the town. In Aberdeen, the\r\ncouncillors are elected by wards, of which there are eleven, each ward\r\nelecting three representatives, one of whom retires annually. The Town\r\nCouncil of Aberdeen consists of 34 members, the Dean of Guild being\r\nan _ex officio_ member. The Town Council is the local authority for\r\nPublic Health, and looks after the streets, buildings and sewers. It\r\nowns the gas works, water works, tramways, electric power station, and\r\npublic parks. It regulates the lighting, cleansing, and sanitation. The\r\nMagistrates, who are elected annually by the Council, are the licensing\r\nauthority, and form the police court for the trial of minor offences.\r\n\r\nThe city of Aberdeen is not like Peterhead and Fraserburgh included in\r\nthe administration of the county, being itself constituted the county\r\nof a city, with a Lord-Lieutenant of its own, who is the Lord-Provost\r\n_ex officio_. It has its own Parish Council as well as its own School\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\nAberdeenshire is represented in Parliament by four members—two for\r\nthe county, east and west, and two for the city, north and south. Some\r\nof the smaller burghs, Kintore, Inverurie and Peterhead, are grouped\r\nwith similar burghs in Banff and Moray (Banff, Elgin, Cullen) to form\r\na constituency called the Elgin Burghs, which returns one member.\r\nIn addition, the University of Aberdeen shares a member with the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow.\r\n\r\nThere is still a certain amount of overlapping and confusion in\r\nthe administrative divisions. For example, Torry, which is on the\r\nKincardineshire side of the Dee, is really a suburb of Aberdeen, and as\r\nsuch elects members to the Town Council, the Parish Council, and the\r\nSchool Board, but it has no share in electing a member of Parliament\r\nfor Aberdeen, being in that regard part of Kincardineshire, and voting\r\nfor a representative of that county. There are other similar anomalies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24. The Roll of Honour.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an accepted fact that Aberdonians have intellectual characteristics\r\nsomewhat different from those of their fellow-countrymen, the result\r\npartly of race, partly and chiefly, we believe, of environment. We have\r\nalready alluded to the amalgamation of nationalities that went to form\r\nthe people of this north-eastern corner of the kingdom. Doubtless the\r\nSpartan upbringing that was the rule in the county served to develop\r\nsturdy character and good physique. The result is that the Aberdonian\r\nhas distinguished himself in all parts of the Empire and even beyond\r\nit. Not that he has often risen to the front rank of greatness, but he\r\nis frequently found well forward among the best of the second-class.\r\n\r\nTheir own county presenting no tempting openings for ability,\r\nAberdonians have migrated from the narrow home-sphere in great numbers\r\nand have made their mark as administrators, medical officers, and even\r\nas soldiers of fortune. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\r\nthe cadets of the great houses, exiled by the pressure of the times,\r\njoined the service of continental kings and rose to high rank in\r\nthe armies of Sweden, France, and Russia. Chief amongst these was\r\nJames Keith, younger brother of the last Earl Marischal, and born\r\nat Inverugie Castle. After serving for nineteen years in Russia, he\r\njoined the service of Frederick the Great, under whom he attained to\r\nthe highest military rank as Field-Marshal, contributing to victories\r\ngained during the Seven Years’ War and conducting the retreat from\r\nOlmütz. At the battle of Hochkirchen, when charging the enemy, he fell\r\nmortally wounded in 1758. Peterhead keeps his memory green by a statue\r\npresented to it by the Emperor William I. It is a replica in bronze\r\nof a similar effigy in Berlin. Field-Marshal Keith is probably the\r\nnative of Aberdeenshire who has figured most largely in history. He\r\nwas Frederick’s right hand, and his military genius has been fittingly\r\nacknowledged by Carlyle in his great work.\r\n\r\nAnother of the same type, though less eminent, was Patrick Gordon of\r\nAuchleuchries, who fought both on the Swedish and on the Polish side,\r\nbut ultimately transferred his sword to Russia, where he rose to the\r\nhighest rank, and on his death-bed was watched over and wept over by\r\nPeter the Great. He was born in 1635 at Auchleuchries near Ellon and\r\ndied in 1699. He was a perfect example of the successful military\r\nadventurer, one of the type so skilfully depicted by Walter Scott in\r\nDugald Dalgetty.\r\n\r\nThe county has been a prolific recruiting ground for the Army. After\r\nthe ’45 Chatham’s device for breaking down the clan system and\r\ndiverting the energies of the Highlanders into healthier channels by\r\nenlisting them in British regiments was an inspiration of genius. In\r\n1794 the Duke of Gordon raised during a few weeks a regiment of Gordon\r\nHighlanders, which first distinguished itself with Sir Ralph Abercromby\r\nin Egypt, and did noble service also in the Peninsula and at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nIn the work of empire-making in India and elsewhere, the Aberdonian\r\nhas borne a notable part. He has shown ability to exercise a singular\r\nmastery over inferior races. Conspicuous in this respect was Sir Harry\r\nB. Lumsden, who formed the Corps of Guides out of the most daring\r\nfree-booters of the North-West frontier of India.\r\n\r\nIn statesmanship the county has been surpassed by other districts, and\r\nyet it has the distinction of having produced one Prime Minister—the\r\nfourth Earl of Aberdeen (1784-1860), who was responsible for the\r\nCrimean War, and whom Byron styled “the travelled Thane, Athenian\r\nAberdeen.”\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiasts of distinction are too numerous to mention. Foremost\r\namongst them was Bishop Elphinstone, who, though not a native of the\r\ncounty, identified himself with its interests when he became Bishop\r\n(1483), founded the University, King’s College, the light of the North\r\n(1494), and the church of St Machar (the Cathedral in Old Aberdeen)\r\nand was a pioneer in all that makes for educational enlightenment. He\r\nwas instrumental in introducing the art of printing into Scotland.\r\nHis tomb is very appropriately in King’s College, the centre from\r\nwhich radiated the beneficent influence of his life. Henry Scougal\r\n(1650-1678), scholar and saint, son of Bishop Scougal and the inspirer\r\nof John Wesley, was a student of King’s College. He had not been long\r\nordained in his charge at Auchterless before he was appointed to the\r\nChair of Divinity in King’s College. He died at 28; but his _Life of\r\nGod in the Soul of Man_ is still greatly prized by lovers of devotional\r\nliterature. Dean Ramsay, whose _Reminiscences of Scottish Life and\r\nCharacter_ (1858) is a classic in humorous literature and one not\r\nlikely soon to be forgotten, was born in Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nIn medical science the roll of eminent names is long and impressive,\r\nfrom Bannerman, who was physician to David II, down to Arthur\r\nJohnston, who after an academic career abroad, cultivated the muses\r\nat Aberdeen, gaining fame as a writer of Latin verse. He was for some\r\ntime physician to Charles I. Born at Caskieben in 1587, he was rector\r\nof King’s College in 1637, and died in 1641. Dr John Arbuthnot, though\r\na native of Kincardineshire, was a student at Marischal College; as\r\nthe friend of Pope and Swift, and the wit and physician at the Court\r\nof Queen Anne, he is likely to be remembered. Another celebrated\r\nphysician was Dr John Abercrombie, who, born in Aberdeen, went to\r\nEdinburgh, and became head of the profession and first physician to the\r\nking in 1824. Others no less noted were Sir James Clark; Sir Andrew\r\nClark; Neil Arnott, a contemporary with Byron at the Grammar School,\r\nand more famous as natural philosopher than as physician, devising\r\nskilful inventions in healing and ventilation; Sir James Macgrigor, to\r\nwhose memory a lofty obelisk in polished red granite was erected in\r\nMarischal College quadrangle. After standing there for years it was\r\nrecently removed to the Duthie Park. Macgrigor was a pioneer in the\r\nhumanitarian treatment of the sick and wounded in war, and was chief\r\nof the Medical Staff in the Peninsular campaigns.\r\n\r\nIn natural science William Macgillivray is known by his careful and\r\nauthoritative work on the _History of British Birds_. James Clerk\r\nMaxwell, who did so much for the advancement of modern Physics, was for\r\na few years professor of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College. Dr\r\nAlexander Forsyth, minister of Belhelvie, invented the percussion lock,\r\nand Patrick Ferguson, a native of Pitfour, invented the breech-loading\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nThe county is remarkable for families with pronounced hereditary\r\nintellectual gifts. The most noted case is that of the Gregories, who\r\nsprang from John Gregory, minister of Drumoak. It has produced fourteen\r\nProfessors in British universities, skilled in Mathematics, Astronomy,\r\nChemistry and Medicine. One of them was the inventor of the reflecting\r\ntelescope. The Reids, the Fordyces, the Johnstons are other cases less\r\nremarkable, but still exceptional.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy is a sphere in which the Aberdonian has left his mark.\r\nThe greatest local name in this regard is that of Thomas Reid, who\r\ncreated the Scottish school in opposition to David Hume, and whose\r\n_Inquiry into the Human Mind on the principles of Common Sense_ was\r\nwritten while he was a Professor at King’s College. Born at Strachan\r\non the south side of the Dee, he was for a time parish minister of\r\nNew Machar. Later he migrated in 1763 to Glasgow, as successor to\r\nAdam Smith. His _Intellectual and Active Powers_ was written after\r\nhis retirement in 1780. Other philosophical writers worthy of mention\r\nare, Dr George Campbell, who, besides his dissertation on _Miracles_,\r\nwrote a _Philosophy of Rhetoric_; Dr James Beattie, whose _Minstrel_\r\nis still read and whose _Essay on Truth_ had a great contemporary\r\nreputation; Dr Alexander Bain, an analytical psychologist, whose books\r\n_The Senses and the Intellect_ and _The Emotions and the Will_ contain\r\nthe most complete analytical exposition of the mind. Bain was the first\r\nProfessor of Logic at Aberdeen, and in conjunction with his pupil Croom\r\nRobertson started the philosophical Review called _Mind_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Professor Thomas Reid, D.D.]\r\n\r\nThe sphere of imaginative literature is not the Aberdonian’s sphere.\r\nCriticism, Philosophy, History, Science are more in his way, and yet\r\na few names can be given as of some note in pure literature. Foremost\r\nin time and unrivalled in his own department is Barbour, Archdeacon\r\nof Aberdeen (1357). He studied at Oxford, and was contemporary with\r\nWycliffe and Chaucer. His great work is _The Brus_, the most national\r\nof all Scottish poems. It is instinct with the spirit of freedom, of\r\nchivalry and romance, and details the struggles, the perils, and the\r\nmarvellous escapes of his hero Robert the Bruce, with great simplicity,\r\nvividness, and directness. Alongside of him we may place John Skinner,\r\nauthor of _Tullochgorum_, _The Ewie wi’ the Crookit Horn_, and other\r\nwell-known songs. A native of Birse and for long episcopal minister\r\nat Longside, he was the father of Bishop Skinner. His fame rests on\r\n_Tullochgorum_, which Burns pronounced to be the best of Scotch songs.\r\nDr W. C. Smith, the author of _Olrig Grange_ and _Borland Hall_, was\r\nborn and educated in Aberdeen. Dr George Macdonald, poet, novelist, and\r\ncritic, author of _Alec Forbes_ and other novels embodying local colour\r\nand illustrating Aberdeenshire life and dialect in the early part of\r\nlast century, was a native of Huntly. The best known poet connected\r\nwith Aberdeen is Byron, who spent some years of his boyhood in the city\r\nand short periods of the summer on Deeside. These visits to Ballater\r\nare reflected in his poem on Loch-na-gar and elsewhere in his work. He\r\nleft Aberdeen at the age of 10 in 1798 and never saw it again.\r\n\r\nHistory is a subject that has appealed to Aberdonians. Dr David\r\nMasson’s monumental work on Milton must be mentioned. Other historians\r\nare Joseph Robertson, John Stuart, John Hill Burton, Bishop Burnet,\r\nwho wrote the _History of his Own Time_, Sir John Skene, and Robert\r\nGordon of Straloch, antiquarian and map-maker, as well as his son\r\nJames, minister of Rothiemay and historian of the early years of the\r\nTroubles. The first Principal of the University, Hector Boece, wrote\r\nhistories somewhat credulous and imaginative but quite authoritative\r\nwhere his own times are concerned.\r\n\r\nOf painters connected with the district may be mentioned Jamesone,\r\nDyce, and Phillip called “of Spain” from his success with Spanish\r\nsubjects. Architecture claims Gibbs, whose Radcliffe Library at Oxford,\r\nand London churches such as St Martin’s-in-the-Fields, still stand a\r\ntestimony to his art; the Smiths and Archibald Simpson have already\r\nbeen mentioned. Sculpture owns the two Brodies and Sir John Steell.\r\n\r\nScholars like Wedderburn and Ruddiman, Cruden of _Concordance_\r\nreputation, Dr James Legge, the Orientalist, and Professor Robertson\r\nSmith, born in the Donside parish of Keig, editor of the _Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica_, Professor of Arabic at Cambridge, and one of the most\r\nlearned pundits of his time—are but a few representatives of a long\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nThe thirst for education and the well-taught parish schools of the\r\ncounty contributed to bring about such results. The doors of the\r\nUniversity have for centuries been opened by bursaries to the poorest\r\nboys, and in this way many who were endowed with capacity above\r\nordinary entered the learned professions and rose to eminence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25. THE CHIEF TOWNS AND VILLAGES OF ABERDEENSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n (The figures in brackets after each name give the population in 1911,\r\n and those at the end of each section are references to pages in the\r\n text.)\r\n\r\n=Aberdeen= (161,952). From being entirely built of granite, Aberdeen is\r\nbest known as “The Granite City.” The light grey stone gives the town\r\na clean look which strikes visitors from cities built of brick or of\r\nsandstone. Its many handsome public buildings, banks, offices, churches\r\nand schools, all solid and substantial, and of great architectural\r\ninterest, are undoubtedly finer than those of any other town of the\r\nsame size in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe first historical reference to it is in the twelfth century; later\r\na charter was obtained from King William the Lion, granting the city\r\ncertain trading privileges. Long before Edinburgh and Glasgow had begun\r\nto show signs of rising to greatness, Aberdeen was a port of extensive\r\ntrade, but its growth was slow until the dawn of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. In 1801, its population was only 27,608; in 1831 this figure\r\nhad doubled, and in recent years, owing chiefly to the phenomenal\r\ngrowth of the fishing industry, its progress has been rapid.\r\n\r\nAberdeen has long been a great educational centre. Its Grammar\r\nSchool claims to have existed in the thirteenth century. Its first\r\nUniversity, King’s College in Old Aberdeen, was founded in 1494 by\r\nBishop Elphinstone, and its second, Marischal College in New Aberdeen,\r\nby Earl Marischal in 1593. These were united in 1860 as the University\r\nof Aberdeen. Since that time the buildings of both Colleges have been\r\nlargely added to, and the number of professorships greatly increased.\r\nIts students in the different faculties, Arts, Medicine, Science, Law\r\nand Divinity are little short of 1000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Old Grammar School, Schoolhill]\r\n\r\nBeing the only really large town in the county, and for that matter\r\nin the whole north of Scotland, it tends to grow in importance, and\r\nits business connections are ever extending. It is the focus of the\r\ntrawling industry, and of the granite trade; while the agricultural\r\ninterests of the county look to Aberdeen as their chief mart and\r\ndistributing medium. Its secondary schools, its technical college, its\r\nagricultural college, its University, all help to swell its population\r\nby bringing strangers to reside within its boundaries. In itself it\r\nis clean, healthy and attractively built, while its fairly equable\r\nclimate, its relatively low rain-fall (29 inches) and its equally low\r\ndeath-rate (14·2 per 1000) conduce to its popularity as a residential\r\ntown. Being the northern terminus of the Caledonian Railway, and having\r\nexcellent service to London by the West Coast, the Midland, and the\r\nEast Coast routes, it obtains a large share of the tourist traffic; and\r\nthe sportsmen who fish in the Aberdeenshire rivers or shoot grouse in\r\nthe Aberdeenshire moors must all do more or less homage to the county\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe chief street of the city is Union Street created a century ago at\r\na cost which was considered reckless at the time but which has been\r\nmore than justified by the results. This first improvement scheme,\r\nwhich has been followed up by others in recent times, was the work of\r\nmen with a wide outlook. Prominent among the Provosts of enlightenment\r\nwas Sir Alexander Anderson, whose name is now at the eleventh hour\r\nstamped in memory by the Anderson Drive—a fashionable west-end\r\nthoroughfare. Union Street is the backbone from which all the other\r\nthoroughfares radiate. It is broad and handsome and the buildings\r\nthat face each other across it are as a rule worthy of the street.\r\nUnion Bridge, one of Fletcher’s graceful structures, with a span of\r\n130 feet, makes a pleasing break in the line of buildings and permits\r\na view north and south along the Denburn valley. The northern view,\r\nwhich shows Union Terrace and Union Terrace Gardens with handsome\r\npublic buildings, both in the foreground and in the background, is\r\nundoubtedly one of the finest in the city. The Duthie Park on the\r\nnorth bank of the Dee, the links that fringe the northern coast, the\r\npicturesquely wooded amenities of Donside, above and below Balgownie\r\nBridge, the quaint other world air of Old Aberdeen with its lofty\r\ntrees, its grand cathedral and the ancient crown of King’s College,\r\nthese are all elevating and meliorating influences that help to keep in\r\ncheck the commercial spirit that rules about the harbour-quays and the\r\nfish-market.\r\n\r\nAberdeen can boast of four daily newspapers besides several weeklies.\r\nIt claims the honour of having the oldest newspaper in Scotland—_The\r\nAberdeen Journal_—established in 1748. (pp. 3, 8, 11, 13, 20, 24, 37,\r\n38, 39, 66, 68, 75, 80, 83, 85, 89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 101, 102, 107, 108,\r\n109, 111, 126, 145, 162, 164, 165, 169, 172, 173.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aberdour= (549) is a small village on the coast half-way between Troup\r\nHead and Rosehearty. Sometimes called New Aberdour to distinguish it\r\nfrom the parish, the village came into existence in 1796. The parish is\r\nvery ancient. Its church, now in ruins, was dedicated to St Drostan,\r\nthe disciple and companion of St Columba. Aberdour is the birth-place\r\nof Dr Andrew Findlater, once Head-master of Gordon’s Hospital (now\r\nCollege), Aberdeen, and first editor of Chambers’s _Encyclopaedia_.\r\n(pp. 39, 62, 105, 119, 164.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aboyne= (1525), properly called Charlestown of Aboyne in compliment\r\nto the first Earl of Aboyne, is a picturesquely situated village on\r\nDeeside with a high reputation for its bracing climate. Near it is\r\nAboyne Castle—for centuries the family seat of the Marquis of Huntly.\r\nIn the vicinity are Lochs Kinnord and Davan. At Dinnet are beds of\r\nkieselguhr. (pp. 2, 8, 24, 31, 88, 117, 119, 162.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Alford= (pa. 1464), on Donside, is the terminus of the branch railway\r\nfrom Kintore and the centre of a rich agricultural district called\r\nthe Vale of Alford. In the neighbourhood are several interesting\r\ncastles—Terpersie, Kildrummy and Craigievar. From Alford the main\r\nDonside road leads up the valley to Strathdon and Corgarff, from which\r\nthere are passes both to Deeside and to Speyside. (pp. 27, 71, 113,\r\n115, 134, 160, 162.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ballater= (1240), a small town beautifully situated on the north side\r\nof the river Dee, in a level space enclosed by high mountains, is 660\r\nfeet above sea-level. From Ballater coaches drive daily to Braemar,\r\npassing Balmoral Castle half-way. (pp. 2, 8, 18, 24, 27, 33, 154, 162,\r\n164, 176.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Birsemore Loch and Craigendinnie, Aboyne]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mar Castle]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Braemar= (502), properly Castleton of Braemar, is the highest village\r\nin the county, being 1100 feet above sea-level. It stands at the\r\njunction of the Clunie and the Dee, and is finely sheltered in a hollow\r\namongst the surrounding mountains. Braemar is a fashionable health\r\nresort. Some 10,000 strangers visit it annually. At the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century it was not much more than a Highland clachan.\r\nNow it has\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ballater, view from Pannanich]\r\n\r\nspacious hotels with electric light and all modern conveniences on\r\na luxurious scale. Six miles distant is the famous Linn of Dee. The\r\nDuke of Fife’s Highland residence, Mar Lodge, as well as Mar Castle\r\nand Invercauld House, the home of the Farquharsons, are all in the\r\nvicinity. From Braemar the ascent of Ben-Macdhui is usually made, and\r\nsometimes also Loch-na-gar. A road leads from Braemar up the valley of\r\nthe Clunie and over the Cairnwell to Blairgowrie. (pp. 8, 21, 22, 33,\r\n66, 68, 75, 112, 161, 162.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Byth= (360), usually New Byth, is a village three miles from\r\nCuminestown, and founded in 1764. It is a bare and treeless district.\r\nNear it are the hills of Fishrie with a large number of crofts given\r\noff by the Earl of Fife in 1830 to poor people evicted from other\r\nestates at a time when the fashion began of amalgamating small holdings\r\nin larger farms. (pp. 91, 124, 163.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Collieston= is a fishing village circling round a romantic bay near\r\nthe parish church of Slains. Here in 1588 one of the ships of the\r\nSpanish Armada (_Santa Catherina_) was wrecked. The fishermen still\r\ncall the creek St Catherine’s Dub. Several small cannon have been\r\nrecovered from the pool. Eighty years ago, Collieston enjoyed a certain\r\nnotoriety for smuggling, and the graveyard of Slains close by contains\r\nevidence of the deeds of violence that the contraband trade brought\r\nabout. (pp. 38, 48, 54.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Culter=, eight miles west of Aberdeen, celebrated for its paper-mills,\r\nwhich date back to 1750. This paper-mill, the first of its kind in the\r\nnorth, manufactured superfine paper and in particular the bank-notes of\r\nthe Aberdeen Bank. (p. 89.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cuminestown= (466), a village on the north side of the Waggle Hill in\r\nMonquhitter, was established by Joseph Cumine of Auchry in 1763. Joseph\r\nCumine was a pioneer in agricultural improvement. He planted trees and\r\nstarted the manufacture of linen. About a mile distant is the smaller\r\nvillage of Garmond. The villages were once much more populous\r\nin the days when the spinning of flax and the knitting of stockings\r\nwere rural industries. (p. 40.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Braemar from Craig Coynach]\r\n\r\n=Ellon= (1307), a thriving town on the Ythan, is the junction for the\r\nCruden and Boddam Railway. It has a shoe factory and large auction\r\nmarts for the sale of cattle. The Episcopal Church—St Mary’s on the\r\nRock—was designed by George Edmund Street and is a handsome building\r\nin Early English style. A prominent divine in the pre-Disruption\r\ncontroversies, Dr James Robertson, was parish minister of Ellon from\r\n1832 to 1843. Later he became a professor in Edinburgh University.\r\nEllon is a place of great antiquity. It was the seat of jurisdiction of\r\nthe Earldom of Buchan, and there the earls held their Head Court. (pp.\r\n29, 41, 163, 164, 171.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fraserburgh= (10,570) is the third largest town in the county. It is\r\na busy, thriving place, being the great centre of the herring fishing\r\nindustry in Scotland. It was founded by Sir Alexander Fraser, one of\r\nthe Frasers of Philorth (now represented by Lord Saltoun). The Frasers\r\nare said to have come into England with the Normans. A royal charter\r\nwas granted in 1546 erecting “Faithlie” as it was then called into a\r\nfree burgh of barony with all the privileges. Sir Alexander Fraser was\r\na great favourite with James VI and was knighted at the baptism of\r\nPrince Henry, 1594: he was a man of enterprise; he built the town and\r\nthe harbour and erected public buildings. He received from King James\r\nthe privilege of founding a University in Fraserburgh, and a building\r\nwas set apart for this institution. Not only so but a Principal was\r\nappointed in 1600. The College may have been active for a few years,\r\nbut very little is known of its history. During the plague which\r\nraged for two years at Aberdeen, the students of King’s College went\r\nfor safety to Fraserburgh in 1647 and, it is supposed, occupied the\r\nold College buildings. A street in the town is still called “College\r\nBounds.” (pp. 8, 38, 59, 61, 76, 94, 95, 101, 102, 163, 164, 169.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Doorway, Huntly Castle]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Bass, Inverurie]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Huntly= (4229), the largest inland town of the county, is situated\r\nat the confluence of the Deveron and the Bogie. It is the centre of\r\nan extensive agricultural district—Strathbogie—and has woollen\r\nand other manufactures. In the vicinity are the ruins of Huntly\r\nCastle, the property of the Duke of Richmond and Gordon. The first\r\nLords of Strathbogie, being opposed to Bruce’s claims of kingship,\r\nwere disinherited and their lands bestowed on Sir Adam Gordon, whose\r\ndescendants became Earls of Huntly, Marquises of Huntly and Dukes of\r\nGordon. The old castle of Strathbogie was destroyed after the battle of\r\nGlenlivet in 1594, but rebuilt as Huntly Castle in 1602. Huntly is the\r\nbirth-place of Dr George Macdonald, poet and novelist. (pp. 29, 31, 91,\r\n160, 162, 164, 176.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Insch= (616), a village on the Great North Railway, with Benachie\r\non one side, and the Culsalmond and Foudland Hills on the other. The\r\nvitrified fort of Dunnideer is in the vicinity. (pp. 119, 164.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Inverurie= (4069), a royal burgh at the confluence of the Ury and the\r\nDon. The workshops of the Great North of Scotland Railway were removed\r\nfrom Kittybrewster to Inverurie some years ago, thereby increasing the\r\npopulation of the burgh. It is one of the Elgin parliamentary burghs.\r\nThe Bass of Inverurie is a conical mound, long considered artificial,\r\nbut now ascertained to be a natural formation due to the action of the\r\ntwo rivers. Inverurie has paper manufactures. In the neighbourhood is\r\nKeith Hall, the seat of the Earl of Kintore. (pp. 27, 71, 80, 108, 109,\r\n113, 132, 137, 160, 162, 164, 165, 169.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Kemnay= (948), about five miles up Donside from Kintore, is well known\r\nfor its extensive granite quarries, which sent stones to build the\r\nForth Bridge and the Thames Embankment. Near it is Castle Fraser, one\r\nof the finest inhabited castles of the county. Fetternear, once the\r\ncounty seat of the bishops of Aberdeen, is on the opposite side of the\r\nriver. (p. 83.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Kintore= (818) is a royal burgh of great antiquity. A mile to the west\r\nare the ruins of Hallforest, destroyed in 1639. Kintore has, in its\r\nvicinity, several “Druidical” circles and sculptured stones. (pp. 27,\r\n49, 108, 136, 160, 162, 164, 169.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Longside= (392) dates from 1801. A woollen factory brought for a\r\ntime prosperity to the village, but this has been given up and the\r\npopulation dwindles. Rev. John Skinner, the author of _Tullochgorum_,\r\nwas for over sixty years minister of the Episcopal Church at Linshart,\r\nclose to the village of Longside. Here also was born Jamie Fleeman,\r\n“the laird of Udny’s fool,” a half-witted person whose blunt outspoken\r\nmanner and shrewd remarks are still widely remembered. (pp. 163, 176.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Maud= is the point where the Buchan railway bifurcates for Peterhead\r\nand Fraserburgh. Maud is a centre for auction sales of cattle. (p. 164.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mintlaw= (377) was founded about the same period as Longside and the\r\nfortunes of both villages, which are three miles apart, have been\r\nsimilar. (p. 163.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Newburgh= (537), on the estuary of the Ythan, was at one time\r\nnotorious like Collieston for smuggling. Ships of small burden still\r\ncome up to its wharf at full tide and sometimes proceed as far as\r\nWaterton. The bed of the estuary of the Ythan is covered with mussels,\r\nmuch used in the past as bait by the local fishermen, as well as for\r\nexport to other fishing stations. The revenue from this source has\r\ngreatly fallen off in recent years—line-fishing having suffered from\r\nthe rise of trawling. (p. 48.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=New Deer= (675) is a village established about 1805. Brucklay Castle,\r\nthe seat of the Dingwall-Fordyce family, recently converted into a\r\nmansion of the old Scottish castellated style, and surrounded with\r\ntasteful grounds, is now one of the most charming edifices in the\r\ndistrict. A mile to the west is the ruined castle of Fedderat. (p. 138.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=New Pitsligo= (pa. 2226) is a village in the neighbourhood of the\r\nsources of the Ugie, and extending for a mile in two parallel streets\r\nalong the eastern slope of the hill of Turlundie. It stands 500 feet\r\nabove sea-level. The village takes its name from Sir William Forbes of\r\nPitsligo, who founded it in 1787. Here a linen trade was at one time\r\ncarried on; this gave place to hand-loom weaving and ultimately to\r\nlace-making. The Episcopal Church was designed by G. Edmund Street,\r\nand it is said to be one of the best examples of his work in Scotland.\r\nThe manufacture of moss-litter from the peat in the neighbourhood was\r\nrecently started. (pp. 91, 163.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Old Deer= (179) is prettily situated on the South Ugie. The district\r\nhas memories of St Columba and St Drostan. In the neighbourhood are the\r\nruins of a Cistercian Abbey, and “Druidical” circles. (pp. 2, 105, 113,\r\n115, 117, 123.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Old Meldrum= (1110) was erected by charter into a burgh of barony in\r\n1672. It is well known for its turnip-seed. It used to employ many\r\npersons in handloom weaving and in the knitting of stockings. Both\r\nindustries have fallen to decay, and the population tends to dwindle.\r\nThere is a long-established distillery in the town. (pp. 108, 112, 163,\r\n164.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peterhead= (13,560), the most easterly town in Scotland, is built of\r\nred granite. A century ago it was a fashionable watering-place, and\r\nused to be a whaling station. Now its chief industry is the herring\r\nfishing. South of the town a harbour of refuge is being constructed by\r\nconvict labour, from the convict prison close by. The harbour of refuge\r\nwill cost, it is said, a million of money and its construction will\r\noccupy 25 to 30 years. A linen factory once existed here, as also a\r\nwoollen factory, which exported cloth to the value of £12,000 a year.\r\nBoth became extinct, but the woollen industry was revived and still\r\nprospers. Another prominent industry is granite polishing. At Inverugie\r\nCastle was born Field-Marshal James Keith, whose statue stands in front\r\nof the Town-House. The “Pretender” landed at Peterhead on Christmas\r\nDay, 1715. Peterhead was erected into a burgh of barony in 1593 by Earl\r\nMarischal, the founder of Marischal College, Aberdeen. It continued\r\nto be part of the Earl’s estates till the rebellion of 1715, when the\r\nlands were confiscated. The Peterhead portion is now the property of\r\nthe Merchant Maiden Hospital of Edinburgh. (pp. 8, 29, 38, 39, 41, 57,\r\n66, 68, 76, 83, 94, 95, 101, 102, 111, 163, 164, 169, 171.)\r\n\r\n=Rosehearty= (1308) is a misspelt Gaelic name of which _Ros_, a\r\npromontory, and _ard_, a height, are undoubted elements. The little\r\ntown stands on the shore a mile north of Pitsligo[1]. There is a\r\ntradition that in the fourteenth century a party of Danes landed and\r\ntook up residence here, instructing the inhabitants, who were mostly\r\ncrofters, in the art of fishing. (pp. 62, 162.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The White Horse on Mormond Hill]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Alexander Forbes, fourth and last Lord Pitsligo\r\n(1678-1762) was a warm supporter of the exiled Stuarts and took part in\r\nboth rebellions. After Culloden, he remained in hiding, his chief place\r\nof concealment being a cave in the rocks west of Rosehearty.]\r\n\r\nM. A.\r\n\r\n=Strichen= (1094) was formerly called Mormond, from the hill at the\r\nbase of which the village stands. This hill owing to the comparatively\r\nlevel character of the surrounding country is a conspicuous feature\r\nin the landscape for miles. On the south-western side, the figure of\r\na horse is cut out in the turf, the space being filled up with white\r\nstones. This “White Horse” occupies half an acre of ground and is\r\nvisible at a great distance. On the south side of the hill an antlered\r\nstag on a larger scale is figured in the same manner. This was done so\r\nlate as 1870. (pp. 11, 16, 38, 91, 158.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Torphins= (455), a rising village on Deeside, much resorted to by\r\nAberdonians in the summer months. (p. 106.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Turriff= (2346) is situated on a table-land on the north of the burn\r\nof Turriff near its junction with the Deveron. Turriff is midway\r\nbetween Aberdeen and Elgin; hence the couplet—\r\n\r\n    Choose ye, choise ye, at the Cross o’ Turra\r\n    Either gang to Aberdeen or Elgin o’ Moray.\r\n\r\nTurriff is very ancient, being mentioned in the _Book of Deer_, under\r\nthe name of Turbruad, as the seat of a Celtic monastery dedicated to St\r\nCongan, a follower of St Columba. The double belfry of the old church\r\n(date 1635) is really a piece of castellated architecture applied to an\r\necclesiastical edifice. The churchyard gateway is also Early Scottish\r\nRenaissance.
