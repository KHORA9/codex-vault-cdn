Vernon\r\n            _Assistant Director, Florida Geological Survey_\r\n\r\nFlorida is truly a child of the sea, since all the rocks composing its\r\nland were formed directly on the ocean bottoms or by streams emptying\r\nalong the shores. From the record of these rocks we know that Florida has\r\nbeen alternately above and below the sea many times in the geologic past.\r\nIn fact, the rocks visible in the park area at Florida Caverns, near\r\nMarianna, Florida, and in the caves were formed from the hard shells of\r\nanimals that lived in one of these seas. As the animals died, their\r\nshells accumulated on the sea bottoms, where they were covered by other\r\nshells and hardened into lime rock.\r\n\r\nThese shells, called “fossils” by the geologist, are remains representing\r\ncemeteries of the past. Along most of our coastal areas and sea bottoms\r\nthese shells are accumulating and forming limestone today. Such limestone\r\nhas formed also in the areas many miles removed from the present seas, as\r\nin Iowa and other middle western states, telling us where seas have been\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: As visitors explore the well-lighted trails and\r\npassageways, they notice the icicle-like formations that hang from the\r\nceilings and the heavier ones that project from the floor. They study the\r\ncolumns that seem to help support the rock above and the small passages\r\nthat extend in many directions. They notice sea shells imbedded in walls\r\nand ceilings.]\r\n\r\nHow do we know that these limestones were formed in the sea? The next\r\ntime you go through the caves at Florida Caverns look closely at the\r\nwalls and you will be able to find the shells of _Scollops_ and other\r\nclams. These animals lived only in shallow seas. The most common shell\r\nthat you will notice will be many small coiled flat shells about the size\r\nof barley seed and flat thin disks about the size of dimes and quarters.\r\nThe animals that formed these shells are known as _Foraminifera_ and have\r\nthe fancy names of _Operculinoides_ and _Lepidocyclina_. They are one\r\ncelled animals (our most primitive) and are related to some of the\r\nparasites that cause disease. These particular animals are extinct and\r\nare known only from these rocks. From their association with other shells\r\nthey are known to have lived in shallow salt-water seas, and by means of\r\nthem the geologist is able to recognize this particular limestone, even\r\nwhen it has been taken from a well drilled many feet below the ground\r\nsurface, for these small shells are recognizable even when the limestone\r\nhas been broken into fine fragments.\r\n\r\nThe limestone in which the caves of Florida Caverns were carved is known\r\nfrom geologic studies made throughout the state to have been raised from\r\nthe sea by land movements after being formed and to have been extensively\r\neroded, following which it was again submerged under the sea and other\r\nlimestones deposited over the eroded surface. These limestones were\r\nsubsequently raised out of the sea to be eroded. Over this second eroded\r\nsurface a delta deposit of sand, clay and gravel was formed by streams\r\nthat emptied into the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe limestone that you will see in the caves is known as the Ocala\r\nlimestone, named from deposits near Ocala, Florida. In the region about\r\nthe Florida Caverns, limestones named the Suwannee limestone and the\r\nMarianna limestone overlie the Ocala limestone. These limestones were\r\nnamed for deposits recognized along the Suwannee river and at Marianna,\r\nFlorida. The sand, clay and gravel overlying all of these limestones are\r\nnot named but are believed to be the same age as deposits of the geologic\r\nperiod popularly known as the “ice age.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The “duck” results from irregular resistance of the\r\nlimestone to solution by ground water. These nodular masses were more\r\nresistant and the less-resistant, usually softer limestone has been\r\nremoved from about them, leaving the form resembling a duck. Several\r\nstalagmites are in the background. These are younger than the “duck.”]\r\n\r\nSince emerging from the sea for the last time, this part of Florida about\r\nthe state park area has been undergoing changes constantly. The rocks\r\nhave been continuously attacked by elements of the weather, and\r\ndisintegrated where exposed. Running streams carry away much of these\r\nproducts of weathering, but the work of water under the ground is the\r\nmajor factor in the creation of these caves and the deposits in them.\r\nThis underground water, running through the pores in the limestone, has\r\nbeen and is now wearing away portions of the land. These water channels\r\nare isolated along fractures, bedding planes and other structural\r\nweaknesses, or along poorly consolidated rock. The water dissolves the\r\nlimestone and carries it out into surface streams and on to the sea, and\r\nas this material is carried away the rock, through which the water flowed\r\nto the surface, is being worn away an equal amount. The amount of this\r\nmaterial being carried away is illustrated at Silver Springs, one of our\r\nlarger springs, where each day about 450 tons of rock is carried away\r\ndissolved in water. When it is realized that this is only one of\r\nthousands of springs in Florida, you can readily see what a large amount\r\nof rock is being dissolved from beneath the ground and just how cavernous\r\nthe rock must be.\r\n\r\n\r\n_All forms of wildlife are protected in Florida’s State Parks. Hunting,\r\ntrapping, or shooting are not permitted. These State Parks belong to you.\r\nHelp protect them._\r\n\r\n_For further information on specific parks and historic memorials write:\r\nDirector, Florida Board of Parks and Historic Memorials, Tallahassee,\r\nFlorida._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground water cascading down a gentle limestone face was\r\nponded irregularly and the evaporation of the water along the outer edges\r\nformed small terraces.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Solution of Limestone\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks in which the caves of the Florida Caverns State Park were\r\nformed are limestone. This rock is made of the mineral calcite, calcium\r\ncarbonate, and it is soluble in pure water under conditions of favorable\r\nstructure, a continuous supply of moving water and time. However, in the\r\nwater of Florida this limestone is readily dissolved, because the humid\r\nclimate and prolific vegetation contribute organic and mineral acids to\r\nwater and make it a highly potent solvent that is capable of dissolving\r\nlarge amounts of this rock.\r\n\r\nLimestone is as a rule jointed vertically and bedded horizontally.\r\nOpenings along these joints and beds provide easy avenues of travel for\r\nwater. The ultimate source of all of Florida’s ground water is from the\r\nrain and precipitates from the air. As this rain water falls through the\r\nair it becomes charged with carbon dioxide gas which combines with water\r\nto form carbonic acid. On the ground humic acids from rotting vegetation\r\nis added. These are the common natural solvents of limestone. A good\r\nportion of this acid charged water soaks into the ground, and as it\r\ndescends through lime rock small portions of the rock are dissolved.\r\nHowever, relatively little solution occurs until sufficient water enters\r\nthe rock to fill completely all the available pores. In this portion of\r\nthe rock, saturated with water and bathed with weak acids, solution is\r\nmost active. Because of the pressure of water entering the rock, ground\r\nwater tends to move horizontally along bedding planes which offer the\r\neasiest exit. Thus, cave systems generally are developed horizontally and\r\none system may lie over another and they may be connected by vertical\r\ntubes and rooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Weird vistas and eerie silhouettes meet the eyes of\r\nvisitors who explore the amazing networks of trails in Florida Caverns.\r\nDroplets of mineral water, dripping through the ages, formed these\r\nunderground caves into a natural, but highly artistic wonderland.]\r\n\r\nAny rain water entering the rock from the surface makes its way downward\r\nto fill completely all the pores of the rock at some depth. At it moves\r\ndownward and then into the saturated rock through pores and open spaces\r\nit acts as a slow solvent to increase the size of the openings and to\r\nconnect them to form a continuous system of channels through which\r\nstreams filling the cavities may run.\r\n\r\nAs large caverns are formed, solution cavities of irregular shape are\r\ngradually cut out and enlarged. Some of these may be expanded to a point\r\nnear the surface where surface deposits (largely sand in Florida) will\r\ncollapse into the cavern and a sink is formed. The larger part of\r\nFlorida’s natural lakes, sinks, depressions and ponds are the result of\r\nsolution of the underlying limestone. These features range from small\r\npits a few feet in diameter to large depressions several miles broad.\r\nMany are perfectly round, others are highly irregular. Some are\r\ncone-shaped with rocky bottoms, some have broadly developed flat bottoms\r\nand are known as prairies. Still others are vertical tubes, only a few\r\ninches in diameter in some cases, that extend as much as one hundred feet\r\ndown into the limestones. These are “natural wells.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Florida’s State Parks include miles of white sand beaches, fine streams,\r\nbeautiful springs, excellent fishing waters, floral displays, wooded\r\nravines and outstanding recreational areas. It is the Florida in which\r\nthe Indians hunted, fished and lived in original surroundings of great\r\nnatural charm and wildlife profusion ... where yet remains the memory and\r\nimprint of Spanish conquistadores, French crusaders and Anglo-Saxon\r\ncolonizers. Phenomena such as disappearing rivers, vanishing lakes,\r\nhistoric shrines, virgin country, strange subterranean landscapes are all\r\nto be seen inside the parks._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Fresh crisp bacon” formed by water flowing originally\r\nfrom a crack or elongate hole and cascading down the face of the\r\nlimestone. The deposit formed as a small ridge that then acted as the\r\ncourse of subsequent water which added additional deposits. The dark\r\nbands contain some impurity to give a color to the ordinarily white\r\ncalcite.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Land Movements in Florida\r\n\r\n\r\nIf these caves, we see in the Florida Caverns Park area, were formed\r\nunder water, how is it possible to walk through them today? This is an\r\nobvious question which requires an answer. If rocks formed under marine\r\nwaters are exposed on the land surface today it is obvious that the land\r\nhas been raised out of the sea, or the sea has lowered. From geologic\r\nevidence it is known that Florida has been rising since late geologic\r\ntime. This elevation is believed to be caused by downwarping at the mouth\r\nof the Mississippi River, where many thousands of box car loads of\r\nsediment are dumped each day, accompanied by adjustments in the earth’s\r\ncrust and the elevation of land areas surrounding the delta of the\r\nMississippi River.\r\n\r\nThen there is a second cause by which these caves are made dry. Everyone\r\nhas heard that ice caps the North and South poles of the earth, but few\r\npeople realize that, if all this ice melted, the level of the sea as it\r\nis known today would be higher by about 110 feet. If all polar ice\r\nmelted, the Chipola River at Florida Caverns, would become a salt bay,\r\nMarianna a seaport town, and a bay beach would be located near the park\r\narea. However, do not sell your present beach property too quickly since\r\nthis polar ice is known to be melting only a few inches a century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Well-lighted, underground trails make accessible Florida’s\r\namazing network of underground passageways. The temperature remains at\r\nabout 63 degrees, F. throughout the year. In addition, natural rock\r\ngardens, wildlife, historical values and recreational facilities make\r\nFlorida Caverns one of the South’s outstanding State Parks.]\r\n\r\nConsidering the sub-tropical climate of Florida, isn’t it peculiar that\r\nice had so much to do in shaping our land surface? As a matter of record\r\nall of the surficial deposits making up the large part of the land\r\nsurface of Florida were created and shaped during the geologic past (one\r\nto ten million years ago) when ice piled up on the poles and moved down\r\nover lower latitudes or when this ice was being melted. In the United\r\nStates as this ice piled up on the North Pole and moved down over most of\r\nthe middle western states, the water forming this ice came from ocean\r\nbasins and the water in them was lowered as much as three to four hundred\r\nfeet. At this time much of the Gulf and Atlantic bottoms was uncovered,\r\nland streams cut their valleys much deeper, ground water circulated much\r\nmore vigorously and rocks through which it passed were dissolved faster.\r\nLater as this ice was melted the lower parts of stream valleys were\r\nfilled with salt water and the streams became sluggish and deposited\r\nsediment in their valleys to make their flood-plains. Ground-water\r\ncirculation was retarded and the bottoms of the Gulf and Atlantic were\r\nagain covered. This uncovering of the bottoms of the Gulf and Atlantic\r\nfollowed by covering constitutes a cycle. Five of these cycles have been\r\nrecognized in Florida, and the red sands, clay and gravel that make up\r\nthe surface of most of Florida represent former bottoms of the Gulf and\r\nAtlantic, now raised out of these seas by land movements.\r\n\r\nToday we are living in a period following a time the northern and\r\nsouthern extremes of the earth were covered by ice, and this ice is still\r\nmelting off of these areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In 71,000 acres of parks, valued at approximately $50,000,000, Florida\r\noffers the vacationer a natural wonderland he can explore. Within these\r\npark areas the visitor can discover for himself the “true” Florida by\r\ncar, along foot trails, navigating tropical rivers and streams—or by\r\nfollowing elevated boardwalks through hauntingly beautiful swamps._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stalagmites resulting from varied origins. The center one\r\nwas formed from the intergrowth of several stalagmites. The deposit on\r\nthe left was developed as a series of flat basin-like parts, over which\r\nwater splashed and cascaded to the floor, the basins being inclined in\r\nvarious directions. The right stalagmite began as did the left one but\r\nthe basins were soon eliminated and the growth was made more regularly.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Deposits in Cave\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen then in the preceding discussion how caves are formed\r\nlargely in rocks saturated with water, and how by land movements and\r\nchanges of sea level the caves and pores formed in this rock are moved\r\nabove permanent water levels and exposed to air. It then becomes possible\r\nto deposit rock in the pores and caves rather than to increase their size\r\nby solution. As you go through the caves you will notice that the walls\r\nare wet and that water is oozing out of the pores of the rock.\r\n\r\nThis water has just passed through limestone and has dissolved parts of\r\nthe rock. The reader undoubtedly knows that water will dissolve a\r\nsubstance in large quantities and more rapidly if it is hot, and that it\r\ncan hold more gases to make stronger acids if it is under pressure. So,\r\nhaving been released from a relatively warm rock in which it was under\r\nsome pressure and where there was little air circulating, into a large\r\ncave where rapidly circulating air cools the cave and evaporates the\r\nwater, this water can no longer hold all the limestone it has dissolved\r\nand it releases part of it.\r\n\r\nSmall drops of water emerging from the lime rock on cave walls are\r\nevaporated and calcite and other rock minerals are deposited along these\r\nwalls. Where these drops cascade along the walls a continuous elongated\r\nridge is deposited. If the water oozes out in an extremely fine coating\r\nof water, the entire ceiling, walls and floor may be paved with calcite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: These deposits combine a rather even and general flow of\r\nwater and possible intergrowth of the stalactites to make the thickened\r\ndeposit. The ground water issued more rapidly and was concentrated at one\r\npoint to make the long tubular deposits, the tube being made by rapid\r\nevaporation along the outer margins of the drops of water as they hang on\r\nthe stalactite before the large part of the water falls to the floor.]\r\n\r\nWhere individual drops collect on the cave ceilings, a thin deposit may\r\nbe formed on the ceiling after which the remaining water may drop to the\r\ncave floor where more calcite is deposited. Continuous dripping results\r\nin paired deposits extending down from the ceiling and up from the floor.\r\nThe deposit on the floor is commonly thicker and more columnar, whereas\r\nthat on the ceiling is thin and tapering much like an icicle. Those\r\nhanging from the ceiling are called _stalactites_ and those on the floor\r\nare _stalagmites_. Where these two deposits are joined they are known as\r\na _column_.\r\n\r\nThese cave formations are all composed of the mineral calcite, which\r\nforms all lime rock. If you will notice in the cave this mineral is\r\ncrystalline, and it is remarkable that as calcite crystallizes from the\r\nmany individual drops of water it is arranged always in a particular\r\npattern. These crystal faces reflect light and form the many unusual and\r\nbeautiful arrangements which you will see in a visit to the caves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Early History\r\n\r\n\r\nSince early time, Florida Caverns have had interest. They were first\r\nmentioned in writings by Friar Barreda, who was with the first overland\r\nexpedition made by the Spaniards to Pensacola Bay. The following\r\nparagraph is in the Friar’s own words, written 256 years ago:\r\n\r\n“On June 12 (1693) we continued northwest and after we had journeyed a\r\nlittle more than three leagues ... we reached an abandoned village of the\r\nChoctaw tribe called San Nicholas where I came to preach the holy gospel\r\nin the year 1674. Here we spent the night in the hollow of such a\r\nbeautiful and unusual rock that I can state positively that more than 200\r\nmen could be lodged most comfortably in it. Inside, there is a brook\r\nwhich gushes from the living rock.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This form is the result of the irregular etching of the\r\nlimestone by ground water at the time the caves were formed, combined\r\nwith the later development of stalagmites and a pavement of calcite\r\n“drip-stone” upon the irregular surface. Dust and small debris have been\r\nincorporated in the crystals of calcite which form the stalagmites.\r\nVisitors like to make a game of finding formations in the cave that\r\nresemble animals and other things. Note the wolf head to the right and\r\nthe Dachshund head to the left center of the photograph.]\r\n\r\nExperts, who know how to read stories told in the designs on Indian\r\npottery, state that the caves were known to the Indians of this section\r\nlong before the coming of the Spaniards. There is considerable evidence\r\nthat Indians, even prior to 1693, had been in the habit of using Florida\r\nCaverns and caves in the vicinity for shelter during their hunting trips\r\ninto the region and for refuge from their enemies. In some of the smaller\r\nand dry caves there have been found potsherds, or small broken pieces of\r\nIndian pottery. According to the archaeologist, all of the sherds so far\r\ndiscovered are of a late post-Columbian type. Ashes from fires, dead for\r\nmany years, flint arrowheads, and animal bones have also been found.\r\n\r\nSeveral times in history, Florida Caverns—a nature-made shelter—was used\r\nas a refuge from armed forces. During Andrew Jackson’s punitive\r\nexpedition against the Indians in 1818, a large band of Indians escaped\r\nfrom his soldiers by concealing themselves within the underground caves.\r\nAgain, during the War Between the States, an outfit of Union soldiers en\r\nroute to Pensacola was resisted by a home guard unit from Marianna,\r\ncomposed of men too young or too old to fight in the armies of the\r\nConfederacy. While the battle was raging, women, children and slaves took\r\nrefuge in Florida Caverns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nestled ’midst hundreds of pines, hickories, sweetgum and\r\noak trees, Florida Caverns golf course is one of the most scenic in the\r\nUnited States. It was laid out after the design of the famous St. Andrews\r\nGolf Course of Scotland.]\r\n\r\nA clear spring, which in reality is a subterranean river, rising out of\r\nthe lime rock, sends its lovely azure stream down through the park over a\r\nmile before it enters the Chipola River. The Chipola Natural Bridge,\r\nlocated in the park, is a fourth-mile long and has been restored to its\r\noriginal interesting geological condition with the removal of logs and\r\nlumber which had jammed into it in bygone days when the river was used to\r\nfloat them down to a mill.\r\n\r\nOpen the year round, Florida Caverns State Park is comparable in interest\r\nto Carlsbad Caverns, N. M., Mammoth Caves, Ky., and Luray Caverns, Va.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its geological attractions, the area in which Florida\r\nCaverns is located is of peculiar interest biologically. In it are found\r\nmany species of both plants and animals that are not expected so far\r\nsouth, as well as a large number of typically southern forms.\r\n\r\nThe State Park system of Florida has been developed as a coordinated\r\ngroup of Parks, each one of which stands upon its own merits and each one\r\npossessing as many as possible of the following values: Outstanding\r\nhistoric, scenic and scientific attractions. Florida Caverns is richly\r\nendowed with them all.\r\n\r\nI hope that you have found this discussion of the creation of lime rock,\r\nthe formation of caves under water, the elevation of these caves above\r\npermanent water levels and the subsequent deposition in them, of\r\ninterest.... We of the Florida Geological Survey and Florida Park Service\r\nhope that you enjoy your visit to the Florida Caverns State Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n_This booklet published by The Florida Park Service, Tallahassee;\r\nphotography by Monte de Oca, F.S.
