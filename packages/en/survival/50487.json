The park\r\nencompasses about 15,000 acres of eastern Randall and western Armstrong\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nThe initial park area was purchased by the State of Texas in 1931. In\r\n1973 the park boundary was extended to incorporate a famous topographic\r\nstructure, the Lighthouse (frontispiece). Excellent picnic and camping\r\nfacilities are available within the Park.\r\n\r\nExtending away from the canyon rim is a gently undulating land surface\r\ncalled the Llano Estacado or Staked Plains. It is part of the High\r\nPlains, a vast piedmont plain which extends along the eastern base of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains from Wyoming to Texas. The eastern edge of this\r\nplain is, in places, an abrupt escarpment (cliff) known as the caprock.\r\nPalo Duro Canyon is a westward extension of this escarpment that has\r\nbeen carved into the High Plains by the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nIn the park area the canyon is several miles wide. The canyon rim is\r\nabout 3,500 feet above sea level and the canyon floor, although highly\r\nirregular is approximately 2,700 feet above sea level. The maximum depth\r\nof the canyon is about 800 feet. The United States Geological Survey has\r\npublished an excellent topographical contour map of the canyon, the\r\nFortress Cliff Quadrangle. It can be purchased at the park or from the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nThe Park area normally receives about 20-30 inches of rainfall per year\r\nand has a frost free period of approximately 200-240 days per year. The\r\nyearly temperature ranges from 0-70°F in the winter and from 65 to 100°F\r\nin the summer. The weather is considered fair about 75% of the time. The\r\nnights are cool even in the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ECOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nPalo Duro Canyon is part of the escarpment system that forms the eastern\r\nboundary of the Llano Estacado or Staked Plains. The Staked Plains in\r\nthis area is a nearly-level to gently-rolling terrain covered with a\r\nmantle of calcareous loess (a wind-blown silt) that has given rise to\r\ndeep soils with a clay-loam surface and a clay subsoil. These soils are\r\nideally suited to the growth of short grasses, especially blue grama and\r\nbuffalo grass. Mesquite, yucca, prickly pear cactus, and forbs are\r\ncommon invaders of overgrazed areas.\r\n\r\nMany shallow lake basins (playas) dot the plains with a flora different\r\nfrom the surrounding areas. In the playas, plains grasses are displaced\r\nby forbs that are suited to withstand the prolonged flooding within the\r\nshallow basins.\r\n\r\nNear the canyon, the deep soils can be seen grading into shallow,\r\ngrayish-brown, gravelly-loam soils. The abundance of grasses decreases\r\nand mid grasses such as little bluestem and sideoats grama increase. The\r\nmid grasses are better able to absorb nutrients from the less fertile\r\nsoils near the canyon rim than are the short grasses. Especially\r\nconspicuous are increasing numbers of shrubs, particularly the evergreen\r\nand scale-leaved junipers. Just along the rim of the canyon, the shrubby\r\nmountain mahogany is found.\r\n\r\nThe rugged terrain of the sides of the canyon, extending from the\r\nOgallala downward through the Trujillo and Tecovas formations to the\r\nupper part of the Quartermaster Formation, shows a variety of soil\r\ntypes. On the steeper slopes, plants are unable to gain a foothold as\r\nerosion removes soil material as fast as it is formed. On less-steep\r\nareas, the well-drained escarpment soil is suited for the development of\r\nscarp woodland. The deep, woody roots of trees and shrubs are better\r\nable to obtain the deeply infiltrating moisture from these soils than\r\nare the shallow and fibrous roots of grasses. The common plants on the\r\nlevel areas are junipers, squaw-bush, and little-leaved sumac. On the\r\ndrier slopes, feather peabush, catclaw, and salt-bush are found. Groves\r\nof oak occur, but not in the abundance found along the escarpment\r\nfurther to the south.\r\n\r\nBelow the canyon slopes and extending to the creek are a wide variety of\r\nsoils and a great diversity of plants. Most of the plants of the plains\r\nand escarpment are found here. Some of the soils of the nearly level\r\nareas are deep, high in fertility, and hold large amounts of water. Tall\r\ngrasses, such as indiangrass and switchgrass, occur admixed with mid\r\ngrasses; a rank growth of vine-mesquite grass often occurs in the areas\r\nwhere runoff water collects; and alkali sacaton grass grows on saline\r\nsoils. Other trees and shrubs include hackberry, soapberry, wafer ash,\r\nbutton bush, foresteria, and Texas buckthorn. Along the creek,\r\ncottonwoods, willows, and salt cedar are common.\r\n\r\nBecause of the varied topography, diversity of plant life, and\r\ngeographical locations, the canyon affords an ideal habitat for\r\nwildlife. Some of the mammals that occur here are the coyote, porcupine,\r\njackrabbit, cottontail rabbit, raccoon, opossum, ringtailed cat, striped\r\nskunk, gray fox, white-footed mouse, woodrat, and bat. Mammals that were\r\nonce common but are now absent or extremely rare are the bison, black\r\nbear, black-footed ferret, lobo wolf, cougar, and bobcat. The moose and\r\nAmerican elk were introduced into the canyon but are no longer to be\r\nfound. White-tailed deer, mule deer, and aoudad sheep have also been\r\nintroduced and are still present. The mule deer is the most common. A\r\ngreat many types of birds are found either as residents of or migrants\r\nto the canyon. A few are the golden eagle, red-tailed hawk, sparrow\r\nhawk, Mississippi kite, turkey vulture, blue quail, killdeer, nighthawk,\r\nroadrunner, red-headed woodpecker, golden-fronted woodpecker, canyon\r\nwren, mockingbird, robin, cardinal, meadowlark, Bullock’s oriole,\r\npainted bunting, white-crowned sparrow, and lark sparrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HISTORY OF MAN IN THE AREA\r\n\r\n\r\nArcheological studies indicate that the earliest known inhabitants of\r\nPalo Duro Canyon lived in the canyon from about 10,000 to 5,000 B.C.\r\nThese early men hunted bison and now-extinct elephant-like mammoths that\r\nroamed the area during the Pleistocene Ice Age. Their stone weapons and\r\nartifacts have been found in the canyon. Presumably these primitive\r\npeople, like those who came later, were attracted by streams and springs\r\nin the canyon, and by game that came to feed there. Rock exposed in the\r\ncanyon provided material for tools and weapons.\r\n\r\nThrough the centuries, various tribes of Plains Indians, including\r\nApache, Cheyenne, Arapahoe, Kiowa, and Comanche, made use of the canyon\r\nas a camping ground. After the arrival of the white man, the canyon\r\nbecame a favorite resting place for buffalo hunters and Indian traders\r\nwho travelled the Plains. White men first established residence there in\r\n1876.\r\n\r\nThe last Indian battle in Texas was fought in the canyon south of the\r\nPark. Col. Ranald Mackenzie and his raiders, on September 25, 1874,\r\nattacked a large encampment of Comanche, Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Arapahoe\r\nin the canyon. They destroyed about 100 lodges and 1400 horses and\r\nmules. The damage inflicted was severe and by the following spring most\r\nof the Indians were returned to the reservation in Oklahoma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GEOLOGIC HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe age of the earth is calculated in terms of billions of years. For\r\nconvenience, geologic time is divided into units, called PERIODS, of\r\ndifferent lengths (Figure 1). Sediments deposited during each period and\r\nthe fossilized remains of animals and plants found in these sediments\r\ngive a partial record of the events and life of that period.\r\n\r\nA nearly homogeneous (uniform composition) rock layer may be identified\r\nas a FORMATION. Formations are usually spread over a wide area like a\r\nlarge blanket and are stacked on top of each other with the oldest at\r\nthe bottom and the youngest at the top. When viewed in the walls of the\r\ncanyon, they resemble a huge layer cake and may be traced along the\r\ncanyon walls.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1.

It was deposited near the edge of a shallow sea that\r\noccupied a wide area in Texas some 280 to 230 million years ago (Figure\r\n3). This was during the Permian Period, the last period of the Paleozoic\r\nEra. The sediments in the park area were carried from the east and\r\ndeposited in a nearshore environment. Sedimentary structures, such as\r\ncrossbeds and ripplemarks, are present throughout the Quartermaster\r\nFormation. Halite casts suggest that there was a high rate of\r\nevaporation as sedimentation occurred. Gypsum (altered anhydrite) is\r\nalso interpreted to be an evaporite deposit. The gypsum is now seen as\r\nhorizontal white layers of alabaster and satin-spar varieties within the\r\nQuartermaster Formation.\r\n\r\nThe Quartermaster Formation is mostly siltstone and shale, and is\r\ncommonly a distinctive red color. This red color is the result of\r\ncombining oxygen from the air with the iron in the sediments (oxidation)\r\nmuch as a nail rusts after it has been exposed for a long period. The\r\nbedded gray zones represent times when there was enough fresh water from\r\nthe land to offset temporarily the oxidation process. Smaller circular\r\ngray areas have organic nuclei that produced local areas of chemically\r\naltered iron by a process called reduction.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Permian Period and the Paleozoic Era, the Panhandle\r\nregion was uplifted and a period of widespread erosion followed.\r\nConsequently there are no sediments in this area to represent the early\r\nor middle portions of the Triassic Period. Breaks, such as this, in the\r\nsedimentary record are called UNCONFORMITIES. They may have been caused\r\nby a lack of deposition in the area or by an interval during which\r\nerosion removed earlier sediments.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3. Paleogeographic map of the Permian Period\r\n    (240 m.y.)]\r\n\r\nThe Tecovas Formation was deposited in swamps, lakes, and streams\r\napproximately 200 million years ago during the Late Triassic (Figure 4).\r\nThe Tecovas is mostly purplish lavender, yellow, orange, and buff\r\nsiltstone and shale. The bright-colored shale of the Tecovas Formation\r\nis easily followed for many miles. Amarillo (the Spanish word for\r\nyellow) got its name from Amarillo Creek where the yellow bed of the\r\nTecovas Formation crops out far from Palo Duro Canyon. The shale of the\r\nTecovas forms the less steep portions of the canyon walls and often is\r\ncovered by talus (weathered, broken rock) or vegetation. The uppermost\r\nTecovas is usually mantled with boulders from the overlying sandstone of\r\nthe Trujillo Formation.\r\n\r\nThe Tecovas Formation contains numerous concretions or irregularly\r\nshaped, weathered rocks. The unusual shape of a concretion is the result\r\nof the hardening of the sediments around a nucleus. As the rock\r\nweathers, the resistant material surrounding the nucleus remains. Most\r\nof the concretions are composed of limonite, hematite, manganite or\r\ncalcite. Some of the calcite concretions are a variety termed\r\n“septarian.” These concretions have calcite ridges in a honeycomb\r\npattern throughout the rock. Some of the concretions are simply nodular\r\nor spherical aggregates. Also in the Tecovas, geodes filled or lined\r\ninternally with calcite crystals are found.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4. Paleogeographic map of the Triassic Period\r\n    (181 m.y.)]\r\n\r\nOverlying the Tecovas is the Trujillo Formation. It was deposited by\r\nstreams that probably originated in an ancient highland southeast of the\r\npresent Panhandle. These streams were flowing more than 181 million\r\nyears ago. The sandstone contains some alternating layers of shale and\r\nmarl-pebble conglomerate. The Trujillo Formation is a resistant\r\nformation and forms some of the upper portions of the canyon walls. The\r\nsteep portions are, in part, the result of a persistent fracture system\r\ncommon in the Trujillo Formation. The sandstone and conglomerate of the\r\nTrujillo characteristically exhibit well-developed crossbedding. Their\r\ngray color is sometimes obscured by a crust of red mud or iron stain.\r\nThe uppermost red shale contains mineralized wood. The gray micaceous\r\nsandstone has many round sandstone concretions. Some of these are\r\nseptarian concretions with cracks filled by calcite. Others may contain\r\nleaf imprints.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that Jurassic sediments were ever deposited in the\r\nregion. Cretaceous rocks are also missing in this area although\r\nwater-worn fossil oysters occur in the gravel at the base of the\r\noverlying Ogallala. These fossils indicate that marine Cretaceous\r\nsediments were deposited nearby and possibly covered the Triassic\r\ndeposits in the region. The rocks were then eroded away some time\r\nbetween the end of the Cretaceous Period and the beginning of the\r\nPliocene Epoch, a span of about 50 million years.\r\n\r\nDuring the Pliocene Epoch, approximately 2-10 million years ago, the\r\nRocky Mountains were again uplifted. Sediments in streams and\r\nfloodplains were deposited on the erosional surface of the Trujillo\r\nFormation (Figure 5). These stream-deposited sediments are the Ogallala\r\nFormation.\r\n\r\nThe Ogallala Formation, which forms the upper part of the sequence of\r\nrocks exposed in the canyon, is present throughout most of the\r\nPanhandle. The formation is important as it is the principal aquifer of\r\nthe Panhandle and supplies many farms and cities in the region with\r\nwater. The Ogallala is a siltstone and sandstone that has, in places,\r\nbeen cemented by silica which came from groundwater. The formation\r\ncontains many pockets of common opal and the basal part is in many\r\nplaces almost a chert. There are also some thin gray shale lenses.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5. Paleogeographic map of the Pliocene (10\r\n    m.y.)]\r\n\r\nScattered over the Ogallala are Late Pliocene and Pleistocene playa lake\r\ndeposits up to 3 million years old. Some of these are fresh water lake\r\ndeposits of silt, limestone, and wind-transported sediments or loess.\r\nBelow these sediments is a layer of caliche which was deposited by\r\nevaporation of groundwater rich in calcium carbonate during Late\r\nPliocene and Pleistocene time.\r\n\r\nLess than one million years ago, during the Pleistocene Epoch of the\r\nQuaternary Period, the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River began\r\neroding headward into the Llano Estacado (Figure 6). The caprock\r\nescarpment is the result of differing resistance to erosion. The faster\r\nerosion of softer layers under the more resistant Ogallala and Trujillo\r\nformations forms the steep slopes of the escarpment.\r\n\r\nThe Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River is the small stream flowing\r\nin Palo Duro Canyon. Throughout the past million years it has been\r\nslowly excavating the canyon. The rate of change has been slow but\r\ncontinuous, carving the steep colorful walls of Palo Duro Canyon, an\r\narea of geologic interest and great scenic beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PALEONTOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Permian Period the area that is now Palo Duro Canyon State\r\nPark, was a nearly-flat land surface along the edge of a restricted sea.\r\nThe scarcity of fossils in the Quartermaster Formation indicates that\r\nplant and animal life was sparse. The environment was probably unsuited\r\nfor plant life. It is thought that groundwater near the surface\r\nevaporated, leaving large amounts of salt as a residue. Since plants\r\ncould not grow, animals would not have frequented the area either.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 6. Headward erosion by the Pecos, Colorado,\r\n    Brazos, Red and Canadian Rivers isolate the High Plains by the end\r\n    of the Pleistocene (10,000 years ago) and cut Palo Duro Canyon.]\r\n\r\nFossils and rocks of the Tecovas Formation indicate that the sediments\r\nwere deposited in a swamp and stream environment (Figure 7). As time\r\nwent on and the land continued rising, the climate became drier and some\r\nof the earlier life forms disappeared.\r\n\r\nRemains of _Metoposaurus_ (‘_Buettneria_’), the last of a long line of\r\ngiant amphibians, are found here. These animals lived in large ponds.\r\n_Metoposaurus_ buried themselves in the bottom of a pond and waited for\r\nfish to pass. With the aid of a third eye in the middle of its head, the\r\nanimal could direct its huge mouth to its prey. _Metoposaurus_ was so\r\nbulky that it is thought that it did not leave the water because its\r\nweak legs could not support its weight on land.\r\n\r\nLiving in shallower areas of the swamp were a group of semiaquatic\r\nreptiles known as phytosaurs. Phytosaurs looked very much like giant\r\ncrocodiles with a nostril on the top of their heads, which permitted\r\nthem to lie submerged just below the surface of the water. They probably\r\nfed on fish and smaller reptiles. Phytosaurs reached a length of 50\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nA heavily armored aetosaur, _Desmatosuchus_ also lived in the Park area\r\nduring the Triassic. They attained a length of about 10 feet. These\r\nreptiles probably were herbivorous (plant eating). A unique feature of\r\n_Desmatosuchus_ was a fringe of backward-pointing horns around their\r\nnecks. These possibly served to protect them from the carnivorous (meat\r\neating) phytosaurs.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 7. Life of Late Triassic time, showing\r\n    restorations of the animals and plants that are now found as fossils\r\n    in the Chinle beds of New Mexico and Arizona. In the water is the\r\n    gigantic labyrinthodont amphibian, _Eupelor_, an animal some six\r\n    feet or more in length. Lying on the bank is the crocodile-like\r\n    thecodont reptile, _Phytosaurus_, large individuals of which may be\r\n    twenty or thirty feet long. Behind the phytosaur, in the distance,\r\n    is the armored thecodont, _Desmatosuchus_, ten feet long, and in the\r\n    foreground is the small, bipedal thecodont, _Hesperosuchus_. In the\r\n    left background are two individuals of the early saurischian\r\n    dinosaur, _Coelophysis_, reptiles about ten feet in length. These\r\n    animals lived in a tropical environment of moderate topography,\r\n    crossed by many sluggish rivers and dotted with lakes. Numerous\r\n    volcanoes rose above the general level of the land. Large,\r\n    araucarian trees were abundant, stout scouring rushes or horsetails\r\n    ten or fifteen feet high were everywhere, and the ground was covered\r\n    with abundant ferns.]\r\n\r\nAlso found in the Tecovas and Trujillo formations are fossil lung-fish\r\nteeth. Lung-fish are a type of fish that can breathe air, enabling them\r\nto move from pond to pond. Footprints of a chicken-sized dinosaur have\r\nalso been found. The Middle Triassic flora was dominated by giant\r\npalm-like trees. Also found are remains of a few large ferns and\r\nhorsetails. As the climate became drier and the swamps began to\r\ndisappear, coniferous (evergreen) trees such as _Araucarioxylon_ became\r\nplentiful. These trees can be found in the canyon today as petrified\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThe Ogallala in the park contains very few fossils. A giant tortoise was\r\nfound near the bend where the road begins to descend into the canyon.\r\nFossil seeds may be seen in the exposure of the Ogallala near the\r\nCoronado Lodge.\r\n\r\nMore extensive Late Pliocene fossil beds are exposed south of the park\r\nin Cita Canyon. These beds are younger than the Ogallala and are stream\r\nand basin deposits. The fauna and flora found here suggest a broad,\r\nflat, grassy plain much like the present landscape (Figure 8). Remains\r\nof mastodons, large, elephant-like animals with long upper tusks that\r\nwere used to dig up roots, are found here. Saber-tooth cats, also\r\npresent, preyed upon the mastodons. The remains of these, as well as\r\nbones of camels, pony-sized horses, and sloths 10 feet high have been\r\nfound in the vicinity of the canyon. Some of these animals are thought\r\nto have lived in the Panhandle a mere 10,000 years ago.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Amebelodon_: shovel-tusked mastodon\r\n  _Teleoceras_: short-legged rhinoceros\r\n  _Synthetoceras_: snout-horned even-toed hoofed mammal\r\n  _Cranioceras_: cranial-horned even-toed hoofed mammal\r\n  _Merycodus_: extinct pronghorn antelope\r\n  _Hypolagus_: extinct rabbit\r\n  _Epigaulus_: burrowing horned rodent\r\n  _Aphelops_: long-legged rhinoceros\r\n  _Prosthennops_: extinct peccary\r\n  _Osteoborus_: short-faced dog\r\n  _Pseudaelurus_: extinct cat\r\n  _Hemicyon_: bearlike dog\r\n  _Procamelus_: llamalike camel\r\n  _Megatylopus_: giant camel\r\n  _Pliohippus_: ancestral one-toed horse\r\n  _Neohipparion_: extinct three-toed horse\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGURE 22.41 Pliocene Mammals.
