May 1917\r\n\r\n            WASHINGTON : GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE : 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER may be utilized for feeding purposes, as pasturage, hay,\r\nor ensilage. With the possible exception of alfalfa on fertile soil,\r\nsweet clover, when properly handled, will furnish as much nutritious\r\npasturage from early spring until late fall as any other legume. It\r\nseldom causes bloat.\r\n\r\nStock may refuse to eat sweet clover at first, but this distaste can be\r\novercome by keeping them on a field of young plants for a few days.\r\n\r\nAs cattle crave dry roughage when pasturing on sweet clover, they\r\nshould have access to it. Straw answers this purpose very well.\r\n\r\nAn acre of sweet clover ordinarily will support 20 to 30 sholes.\r\n\r\nOn account of the succulent growth, it is often difficult, in humid\r\nclimates, to cure the first crop of the second season into a good\r\nquality of hay.\r\n\r\nWhen seeded without a nurse crop, one cutting of hay may be obtained\r\nthe first year in the North and two or three cullings in the South.\r\nTwo cuttings are often obtained in the South after grain harvest. The\r\nsecond year a cutting of hay and a seed crop usually are harvested.\r\n\r\nSweet clover should never be permitted to show flower buds before it\r\nis cut for hay. It is very important that the first crop of the second\r\nseason be cut so high that a new growth will develop. When the plants\r\nhave made a growth of 36 to 40 inches it may be necessary to leave the\r\nstubble 10 to 12 inches high.\r\n\r\nIn cutting the first crop of the second season it is a good plan to\r\nhave extension shoe soles made for the mower, so that a high stubble\r\nmay be left. In some sections of the country sweet clover as a silage\r\nplant is gaining in favor rapidly.\r\n\r\nThis crop has given excellent results as a feed for cattle and sheep.\r\nExperiments show that it compares favorably with alfalfa.\r\n\r\nSweet clover has proved to be a profitable soil-improving crop. The\r\nlarge, deep roots add much humus to the soil and improve the aeration\r\nand drainage. As a rule, the yield of crops following sweet clover is\r\nincreased materially.\r\n\r\nBeing a biennial, this crop lends itself readily to short rotations.\r\n\r\nSweet clover is a valuable honey plant, in that in all sections of the\r\ncountry it secretes an abundance of nectar.\r\n\r\nThis bulletin discusses only, the utilization of sweet clover. A\r\ndiscussion of the growing of the crop may be found in Farmers' Bulletin\r\n797.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER: UTILIZATION.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] The growing of this crop has been discussed in a previous\r\npublication, Farmers' Bulletin 797, entitled \"Sweet Clover; Growing the\r\nCrop.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   Page.\r\n\r\n  General statement of the uses of sweet clover       3\r\n\r\n  Sweet clover as a pasture crop                      4\r\n\r\n  Sweet clover hay                                   10\r\n\r\n  Sweet clover as a silage crop                      20\r\n\r\n  Sweet clover as a soiling crop                     22\r\n\r\n  Sweet clover as a feed                             23\r\n\r\n  Sweet clover as a soil-improving crop              28\r\n\r\n  Sweet clover in rotations                          31\r\n\r\n  Sweet clover as a honey plant                      32\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL STATEMENT OF THE USES OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utilization of sweet clover as a feed for all classes of live stock\r\nhas increased rapidly in many parts of the country, owing primarily to\r\nthe excellent results obtained by many farmers who have used this plant\r\nfor pasturage or hay, and also to the fact that feeding and digestion\r\nexperiments conducted by agricultural experiment stations show that it\r\nis practically equal to alfalfa and red clover as a feed.\r\n\r\nAs a pasture plant, sweet clover is superior to red clover, and\r\npossibly alfalfa, as it seldom causes bloat, will grow on poor soils,\r\nand is drought resistant. The favorable results obtained from the\r\nutilization of this crop for pasturage have done much to promote\r\nits culture in many parts of the United States. On account of the\r\nsucculent, somewhat stemmy growth of the first crop the second year,\r\ndifficulty is often experienced in curing the hay in humid sections, as\r\nit is necessary to cut it at a time when weather conditions are likely\r\nto be unfavorable. When properly cured the hay is relished by stock.\r\n\r\nAt the present time sweet clover is used to only a limited extent for\r\nsilage, but its use for this purpose should increase rapidly, as the\r\nresults thus far obtained have been very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the value of sweet clover as a feed, it is one of the\r\nbest soil-improving crops adapted to short rotations which can be\r\ngrown. When cut for hay, the stubble and roots remain in the soil, and\r\nwhen pastured, the uneaten parts of the plants, as well as the manure\r\nmade while animals are on pasture, are added to the soil and benefit\r\nthe succeeding crops. In addition to humus, sweet clover, in common\r\nwith all legumes, adds nitrogen to the soil. This crop is grown in many\r\nsections of the country primarily to improve soils, and the benefits\r\nderived from it when handled in this manner have justified its use, as\r\nthe yields of succeeding crops usually are increased materially.\r\n\r\nThe different species of sweet clover are excellent honey plants, as\r\nthey produce nectar over a long period in all sections of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Cattle pasturing on sweet clover.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER AS A PASTURE CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the possible exception of alfalfa on fertile soils, no other\r\nleguminous crop will furnish as much nutritious pasturage from early\r\nspring until late fall as sweet clover when it is properly handled.\r\nLive stock which have never been fed sweet clover may refuse to eat\r\nit at first, but this distaste is easily overcome by turning them on\r\nthe pasture in the spring, as soon as the plants start growth (fig.\r\n1). Many cases are on record where stock have preferred sweet clover\r\nto other forage plants. The fact that it may be pastured earlier in\r\nthe spring than many forage plants and that it thrives throughout\r\nthe hot summer months makes it a valuable addition to the pastures\r\non many farms. Sweet clover is an especially valuable forage plant\r\nfor poor soils where other crops make but little growth, and it is\r\nupon such soils that thousands of acres of this crop are furnishing\r\nannually abundant pasturage for all kinds of live stock. In many\r\nportions of the Middle West, where the conditions are similar to those\r\nof southeastern Kansas, it bids fair to solve the serious pasturage\r\nproblems. Native pastures which will no longer provide more than a\r\nscant living for a mature steer on 4 or 5 acres, when properly seeded\r\nto sweet clover will produce sufficient forage to carry at least one\r\nanimal to the acre throughout the season. In addition to this, a crop\r\nof hay or a seed crop may be harvested from a portion of the land when\r\nit is so fenced that the stock may be confined to certain parts of\r\nthe field at specific times. Land which is too rough or too depleted\r\nfor cultivation, or permanent pastures which have become thin and\r\nweedy, may be improved greatly by drilling in, after disking, a few\r\npounds of sweet-clover seed per acre. Not only will the sweet clover\r\nadd considerably to the quality and quantity of the pasturage but\r\nthe growth of the grasses will be improved by the addition of large\r\nquantities of humus and nitrogen to the soil.\r\n\r\nSweet clover has proved to be an excellent pasture crop on many of the\r\nbest farms in the North-Central States. In this part of the country it\r\nmay be seeded alone and pastured from the middle or latter part of June\r\nuntil frost, or it may be sown with grain and pastured after harvest.\r\n\r\nWhen sweet clover has been seeded two years in succession on separate\r\nfields, the field sown the first year may be pastured until the middle\r\nof June, when the stock should be turned on the spring seeding. When\r\nhandled in this manner excellent pasturage is provided throughout the\r\nsummer, and a hay or seed crop may be harvested from the field seeded\r\nthe previous season.\r\n\r\nSome of the best pastures in Iowa consist of a mixture of Kentucky\r\nbluegrass, timothy, and sweet clover. On a farm observed near Delmar,\r\nIowa, stock is pastured on meadows containing this mixture from the\r\nfirst part of April to the middle of June. From this time until the\r\nfirst part of September the stock is kept on one-half to two-thirds the\r\ntotal pasture acreage. The remainder of the pasture land is permitted\r\nto mature a seed crop. After the seed crop is harvested the stock\r\nagain is turned on this acreage, where they feed on the grasses and\r\nfirst-year sweet-clover plants until cold weather. The seed which\r\nshatters when the crop is cut is usually sufficient to reseed the\r\npastures. By handling his pasture land in this manner, the owner of the\r\nfarm has always had an abundance of pasture and at the same time has\r\nobtained each year a crop of 2 to 4 bushels of recleaned seed to the\r\nacre from one-third to one-half of his pasture land. This system has\r\nbeen in operation on one field for 20 years and not until the last two\r\nyear's has bluegrass showed a tendency to crowd out the sweet clover.\r\nIt is essential that sufficient stock be kept on the pastures to keep\r\nthe plants eaten rather closely, so that at all times there will be an\r\nabundance of fresh shoots.\r\n\r\nWhenever the first crop of the second year is not needed for hay or\r\nsilage it can be used for no better purpose than pasturage. In fact,\r\nit is better to pasture the fields until the middle of June, as this\r\naffords one of the most economical and profitable ways of handling the\r\nfirst crop. In addition to its value for pasture, grazing induces the\r\nplants to send out many young shoots close to the ground, so that when\r\nthe plants are permitted to mature seed a much larger number of stalks\r\nare formed than would be the case if the first crop were cut for hay.\r\nThe hay crop is likely to be cut so close to the ground that the plants\r\nwill be killed, whereas but little danger of killing the plants arises\r\nfrom close pasturing early in the season. Excellent stands of sweet\r\nclover will produce an abundance of pasturage for two to three mature\r\nsteers per acre from early spring to the middle of June.\r\n\r\nCattle which are pasturing on sweet clover alone crave dry feed. Straw\r\nhas been found to satisfy this desire and straw or hay should be\r\npresent in the meadow at all times, After stock are removed from the\r\nfield it is an excellent plan to go over it with a mower, setting the\r\ncutter bar so as to leave the stubble 6 to 8 inches high. This will\r\neven up the stand, so that the plants will ripen seed at approximately\r\nthe same date.\r\n\r\nExperiments by many farmers in the Middle West show that sweet clover\r\nis an excellent pasture for dairy cattle. When cows are turned on\r\nsweet clover from grass pastures the flow of milk is increased and its\r\nquality improved. Other conditions being normal, this increase in milk\r\nproduction will continue throughout the summer, as the plants produce\r\nan abundance of green forage during the hot, dry months when grass\r\npastures are unproductive. If pastures are handled properly they will\r\ncarry at least one milk cow to the acre during the summer months.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country sweet clover has proved to be an excellent\r\npasturage crop for hogs. When it is utilized for this purpose it\r\nusually is seeded alone and pastured for two seasons. The hogs may be\r\nturned on the field the first year as soon as the plants have made a\r\n6-inch growth. From this time until late fall an abundance of forage\r\nis produced, as pasturing induces the plants to send out many tender,\r\nsucculent branches. Pasturing the second season may begin as soon as\r\ngrowth starts in the spring. If the field is not closely grazed the\r\nsecond season it is advisable to clip it occasionally, leaving an\r\n8-inch stubble, so as to produce a more succulent growth.\r\n\r\nAn acre of sweet-clover pasture ordinarily will support 20 to 30 shotes\r\nin addition to furnishing a tight cutting of hay (fig. 2). For the best\r\ngrowth of the hogs, they should be fed each day 2 pounds of grain per\r\nhundredweight of the stock. Hogs are very fond of sweet clover roots\r\nand should be ringed before being turned on the pasture. The tendency\r\nto root may generally be overcome by adding some protein to the grain\r\nration. Meat meal serves this purpose very well.\r\n\r\nThe Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station conducted an interesting\r\npasturing experiment with spring pigs in 1910, In this experiment, pigs\r\nweighing approximately 38 pounds each were pastured for a period of\r\n141 days on two plats of red clover, a plat of Dwarf Essex rape, and a\r\nplat of yellow biennial sweet clover. The pigs pasturing on each plat\r\nreceived a ration of ear corn. The ration given to the pigs on one plat\r\nof red clover and on that of rape was supplemented with meat meal to\r\nthe extent of one-tenth of the ear corn ration. The feed given to the\r\npigs pasturing on sweet clover was supplemented with meat meal at the\r\nsame rate during only the last 57 days of the test. The red clover was\r\nseeded in 1908 and reseeded in 1909, so that the plat contained a very\r\ngood stand of plants at least one year old. The sweet clover was seeded\r\nin the spring of 1910, while the rape was sown on April 4, 1910, in\r\n24-inch rows. The pigs were turned on the forage plats on June 22.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Hogs pasturing on sweet clover.]\r\n\r\nThe results of this experiment, as presented in Table I, show that\r\nsweet clover carried more pigs to the acre and produced cheaper gains\r\nand a greater net profit per acre than either red clover or rape. To\r\njudge from the date of seeding of the plants tested, it was to be\r\nexpected that the pigs pasturing on the sweet clover would not gain\r\nas rapidly at first as those pasturing on the other forage plants,\r\nas the growth of the sweet clover at this time was undoubtedly much\r\nless than that of the other crops. This assumption is borne out by the\r\nresults given for the first 84 days of the test. During this period\r\nthe pigs on the rape made a net gain of $11.55 per acre and those on\r\nthe red clover $6.86 per acre more than those on the sweet clover. In\r\nthese computations corn was valued at 50 cents per bushel and hogs at\r\n$6 per hundredweight. During the latter part of the experiment there\r\nwas but a scant growth of red clover on the plats, while the sweet\r\nclover produced an abundance of forage, and during this period of the\r\nexperiment the pigs pasturing on sweet clover made a net gain of $10.14\r\nper acre more than those pasturing on red clover and $17.41 per acre\r\nmore than those pasturing on rape. (Table I.) The difference in net\r\nprofits probably would have been greater had white sweet clover been\r\nused instead of yellow sweet clover, as it makes a larger growth and\r\ncontains approximately the same ratio of food elements.\r\n\r\nTable I.--Relative merits of Dwarf Essex rape, red clover, and yellow\r\nsweet clover when pastured by spring pigs for 141 days, June 22 to\r\nNovember 10, 1910.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-------+-------+--------+---------------+--------+-------\r\n                             |      |       |       |        |Supplementary  |        |\r\n                             |      |       |       |        |feed required  | Total  | Net\r\n                             |      |       |       |        |   for 100     |  cost  |profit\r\n                             |      |Initial| Total |Average |pounds of gain.| of 100 |  per\r\n                             |Number| weight| gain, | daily  +-------+-------+ pounds |acre.[3]\r\n  Forage tested, plat area,  |  of  |  per  |  all  |  gain  |Shelled| Meat  |   of   |\r\n    and ration.              | hogs.|  hog. | hogs. |per hog.| corn. | Meal. |gain.[2]|\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+--------\r\n                             |      |Pounds.|Pounds.| Pounds.|Pounds.|Pounds.|        |\r\n  Rape (Dwarf Essex, 0.9     |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n    acre), and ear corn[4]   |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n    plus one-tenth meat meal.| 18   | 37.8  |2,801.7|  1.10  | 292.5 | 33.99 | $3.79  |  ......\r\n      Reduced to acre basis. | 20   | ....  |3,113.0|  ....  | ..... | ..... |  ..... |  $88.64\r\n                             |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n  Clover (medium red, 0.8    |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n    acre) and ear corn       |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n    alone[4].                | 15   | 39.0  |1,790.0|   .84  | 370.6 | None. | 3.71   | ......\r\n      Reduced to acre basis. | 18.75| ....  |2,237.5|  ....  | ..... | ..... | .....  |  51.20\r\n                             |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n  Clover (medium red, 0.8    |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n    acre) and ear corn[4]    |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n    plus one-tenth meat meal.| 15   | 39.0  |2,394.0|  1.13  | 299.3 | 34.77 | 3.84   | ......\r\n      Reduced to acre basis. | 18.75| ....  |2,992.5|  ....  | ..... | ..... | .....  |  64.55\r\n                             |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n  Sweet clover[5] (yellow    |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n    biennial, 0.8 acre) and  |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n    ear corn[4] plus         |      |       |       |        |       |       |        |\r\n    one-tenth meat meal.     | 18   | 37.8  |2,594.0|  1.02  | 313.6 | 24.70 | 3.70   | ......\r\n      Reduced to acre basis. | 22.60| ....  |3,242.5|  ....  | ..... | ..... | .....  |  74.50\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+---------\r\n\r\n[2] Corn valued at 50 cents per bushel, meat meal at $2.50 per\r\nhundredweight.\r\n\r\n[3] Hogs valued at $6 per hundredweight.\r\n\r\n[4] During the first 84 days of the test, practically two-thirds of the\r\ntime, a limited ration of corn was given, while during the last 57 days\r\nthe pigs received a full feed.\r\n\r\n[5] The pigs pasturing on sweet clover received meat meal only during\r\nthe last 57 days of the experiment.\r\n\r\nAn experiment reported by the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation shows that a mixture of rape and sweet clover makes an\r\nexceptionally fine pasture for hogs. In this experiment the mixture\r\nof rape and sweet clover produced more pasturage than alfalfa and was\r\npreferred to alfalfa by the hogs. It was seeded at the rate of 6 pounds\r\nof Dwarf Essex rape and 10 pounds of sweet clover to the acre.\r\n\r\nSheep relish sweet clover and make rapid gains when pastured on it.\r\nCare must be taken to see that pastures are not overstocked with sheep,\r\nas they are likely to eat the plants so close to the ground as to kill\r\nthem. This is especially true the first year, before the plants have\r\nformed crown buds. Yellow biennial sweet clover probably would not\r\nsuffer from this cause as much as the white species, because the plants\r\nmake a more prostrate growth and are not likely to be eaten so closely\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nHorses and mules do well on sweet-clover pastures. On account of the\r\nhigh protein content sweet clover provides excellent pasturage for\r\nyoung stock. No cases of slobbering have been noted with horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAINTING MILK AND BUTTER.\r\n\r\nMilk may be tainted occasionally when cows are pasturing on sweet\r\nclover. However, the large majority of farmers who pasture sweet\r\nclover on an extensive scale report very little or no trouble. The\r\nflavor imparted to milk at times is not disliked by all people, as\r\nsome state that it is agreeable and does not harm the market value of\r\ndairy products in the least. This trouble is experienced for the most\r\npart in the early spring. The tainting of milk may be avoided by taking\r\nthe cows off the pasture two hours before milking and keeping them off\r\nuntil after milking the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOATING.\r\n\r\nUnlike the true clovers and alfalfa, sweet clover seldom causes bloat;\r\nin fact, with the exception of the summer of 1915, only a few authentic\r\ncases of bloat have thus far been recorded in sections where large\r\nacreages are pastured with cattle and sheep. A number of cases of bloat\r\nwore reported in Iowa during the abnormally wet season of 1915. No\r\nsatisfactory explanation for this comparative freedom from bloating\r\nhas been offered. It is held by some that the coumarin in the plants\r\nprevents bloating, but this has not been established experimentally.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR BLOAT.\r\n\r\n_Cattle._--If the case of bloat is not extreme, it may be sufficient to\r\ndrive the animals at a walk for a quarter or half an hour. In urgent\r\ncases the gas must be allowed to escape without delay, and this is\r\nbest accomplished by the use of the trocar. In selecting the place for\r\nusing the trocar, the highest point of the distended flank equally\r\ndistant from the last rib and the point of the hip must be chosen.\r\nHere an incision about three-fourths of an inch long should be made\r\nwith a knife through the skin, and then the sharp point of the trocar,\r\nbeing directed downward, inward, and slightly forward, is thrust into\r\nthe paunch. The sheath of the trocar should be left in the paunch as\r\nlong as any gas continues to issue from it. In the absence of a trocar\r\nan incision may be made with a small-bladed knife and a quill used to\r\npermit the gas to escape. Care must be taken to see that the quill does\r\nnot work down out of sight into the incision.\r\n\r\nAnother remedy consists in tying a large bit, the diameter of a\r\npitchfork handle, in the mouth, so that a piece of rubber tubing may\r\nbe passed through the mouth to the first stomach to allow the gas to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal is not distressed and the swelling of the flank is not\r\ngreat, or when the most distressing condition has been removed by the\r\nuse of the trocar, it is best to administer internal medicine. Two\r\nounces of aromatic spirits of ammonia should be given every half hour\r\nin a quart of cold water, or half an ounce of chlorid of lime may be\r\ndissolved in a pint of tepid water and the dose repeated every half\r\nhour until the bloating has subsided.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] See \"Diseases of Cattle,\" a special report of the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry.\r\n\r\nFor acute bloating the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station\r\nrecommends 1 quart of a 1-1/2 per cent solution of formalin, followed\r\nby placing a wooden block in the animal's mouth and by gentle exercise\r\nif the animal can be gotten up.\r\n\r\n_Sheep._--Gas may be removed quickly from bloated sheep by using a\r\nsmall trocar. The seat of the operation is on the most prominent\r\nportion of the left flank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET-CLOVER HAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen sweet-clover hay is cut at the right time and cured properly it\r\nis eaten readily by all classes of live stock. As the hay is rich in\r\nprotein, growing stock make gains on it comparable to the gains of\r\nthose fed on alfalfa. The quantity and quality of the milk produced\r\nwhen the hay is fed to cows are approximately the same as when other\r\nlegumes are used. Hay which is cut the first year is fine stemmed and\r\nleafy and resembles alfalfa in general appearance. Unless it is cut at\r\nthe proper time the second year, it will be stemmy and unpalatable.\r\nFeeding experiments show that it contains practically as much\r\ndigestible protein as alfalfa and more than red clover, but the hay is\r\nnot as palatable as red clover or alfalfa when the plants are permitted\r\nto become coarse and woody. When sweet clover is seeded in the spring\r\nwithout a nurse crop in the northern and western sections of the United\r\nStates, a cutting of hay may be obtained the same autumn. When it is\r\nseeded with a nurse crop in these regions, the rainfall during the\r\nlate summer and early fall will largely determine whether the plants\r\nwill make sufficient growth to be cut for hay. On fertile, well-limed\r\nsoils in the East, in the eastern North-Central States, in Iowa, and\r\nin eastern Kansas a cutting of hay is commonly obtained after grain\r\nharvest when the rainfall is normal or above normal. In many sections\r\nof the country two, and at times three, cuttings of hay may be obtained\r\nthe second year (fig. 3).\r\n\r\nIn the South two, and sometimes three, cuttings may be obtained the\r\nfirst year if the seeding is done without a nurse crop. When the seed\r\nis sown in the spring with oats, two cuttings may be secured after oat\r\nharvest. Three cuttings may be obtained the second year, although it is\r\nthe common practice to cut the first crop for hay and the second crop\r\nfor seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYIELDS OF SWEET-CLOVER HAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total yields of sweet clover per acre for the season are usually\r\nless than those of alfalfa except in the semiarid unirrigated portions\r\nof the country. Sweet clover ordinarily yields more to the acre than\r\nany of the true clovers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Cutting sweet clover for hay in western Kansas.]\r\n\r\nWhen the seed is sown in the spring in the North without a nurse crop,\r\nyields of 1 to 3 tons of hay of good quality may be expected the\r\nfollowing autumn, The Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station\r\nobtained 2,700 pounds of hay per acre in the fall from spring seeding,\r\nwhile the United States Department of Agriculture obtained 3,000 pounds\r\nof hay per acre in August from May seeding in Maryland. Yields of 1\r\nto 2 tons, and occasionally 3 tons, have been obtained in Michigan,\r\nIllinois, Iowa, Kansas, the Dakotas, and other States. In Illinois,\r\nIowa, and Kansas yields of 1 to 1-1/2 tons are often obtained after\r\ngrain harvest when weather conditions are favorable.\r\n\r\nThe first crop the second season yields 1-1/2 to 3 tons of hay to the\r\nacre in the northern and western sections of the United States. The\r\nsecond crop of the second season will yield from three-fourths to 1-1/2\r\ntons to the acre, although this crop usually is cut for seed.\r\n\r\nWhen sweet clover is seeded in the South without a nurse crop on fairly\r\nfertile soil that is not acid, three cuttings of hay, averaging at\r\nleast a ton to the cutting, may be secured the year of seeding. When\r\nthe seed is sown in the early spring on winter grain, two cuttings,\r\nyielding at least 1 ton to the cutting, may be obtained. The first crop\r\nthe second season yields on an average 1-1/2 to 3 tons of hay to the\r\nacre. In 1903 the Alabama Canebrake Station obtained 2-1/2 tons of hay\r\nafter oat harvest and a total yield of 3 tons per acre from the same\r\nfield in 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME TO CUT SWEET CLOVER FOR HAY.\r\n\r\nThe first season's growth of sweet clover does not usually get coarse\r\nand woody and therefore may be cut when it shows its maximum growth in\r\nthe fall, In regions where more than one crop may be obtained the first\r\nseason, the first crop should be cut when the plants have made about a\r\n30-inch growth.\r\n\r\nThe proper time to cut the first crop the second season will vary\r\nconsiderably in different localities, depending very much upon the\r\nrainfall, the temperature, and the fertility of the soil. In no event\r\nshould the plants be permitted to show flower buds or to become woody.\r\nIn the semiarid sections of the country sweet clover does not grow as\r\nrapidly as in more humid regions. Neither do the plants grow as rapidly\r\non poor soils as upon fertile soils. In the drier sections the best\r\nresults usually are obtained by cutting the first crop when the plants\r\nhave made a growth of 24 to 30 inches. On fertile, well-limed soils in\r\nmany sections of the country a very rapid growth is made in the spring,\r\nand often the plants will not show flower buds until they are about\r\n5 feet high. On such soils it is very essential that the first crop\r\nbe cut when the plants have made no more growth than 30 to 32 inches\r\nif hay is desired which is not stemmy and if a second growth is to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEIGHT OF STUBBLE TO BE LEFT WHEN CUTTING FOR HAY.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to leave more than an ordinary stubble when cutting\r\nthe sweet-clover hay crop in the fall of the year of seeding. A stubble\r\n4 or 6 inches in height, however, will serve to hold drifting snow and\r\nundoubtedly will be of some help in protecting the plants from winter\r\ninjury. While sweet clover without question is more hardy than red\r\nclover, usually more or less winterkilling occurs, and any protection\r\nwhich may be afforded during cold weather will be of considerable\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nWhile the first crop in the second year comes from the crown buds, the\r\nnew branches which produce the second crop of the second year come from\r\nthe buds formed in the axils of the leaves on the lower portions of the\r\nstalks which constitute the first crop, as shown in figure 4. These\r\nbranches usually commence growth when the plants are about 24 inches\r\nhigh. In fields where the stand is heavy and where the lower portions\r\nof the plants are densely shaded, these shoots are soon killed from\r\nlack of necessary light. (Figs. 4 and 5.) The branches which are\r\nfirst to appear and which are first to be killed are those closest to\r\nthe ground. It is therefore very important when cutting this crop to\r\ncut the plants high enough from the ground to leave on the stubble a\r\nsufficient number of buds and young branches to produce a second crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Sweet-clover plants, showing the direct\r\nrelation that exists between the thickness of stand, the time of\r\ncutting, and the height at which the stubble must be cut if a second\r\ncrop is to be expected. The plant at the left was cut 10 day later than\r\nthe plant at the right. Note the height at which it was necessary to\r\ncut this plant so that a second crop would develop and also the scars\r\non the stubble where young shoots had started earlier and were killed\r\nfrom lack of sunlight. When the stand is thin the young shoots will\r\nsurvive, as they did on the plant at the right, even though the field\r\nis cut at a later date.]\r\n\r\nExamination of hundreds of acres of sweet clover in different sections\r\nof the United States during the summers of 1915 and 1916 showed that\r\nthe stand on at least 50 per cent of the fields was partly or entirely\r\nkilled by cutting the first crop the second season too close to the\r\nground. A direct relation exists between the thickness of the stand,\r\nthe height of the plants, and the height at which the stubble should\r\nbe cut if a second crop is to be harvested. It is very essential to\r\nexamine the fields carefully before mowing, so as to determine the\r\nheight at which the plants should be cut in order to leave at least one\r\nhealthy bud or young branch on each stub. In fact, the stand should\r\nbe cut several inches above the young shoots or buds, the stubble may\r\ndie back from 1 to 3 inches if the plants are cut during damp or rainy\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Stubble of sweet clover collected in fields\r\nwhere 90 per cent of the plants had been killed by cutting too closely\r\nto the ground. The heavy stands in these fields were not cut until the\r\nplants had made a growth of 36 to 40 inches. Note the scars on the\r\nstubble where young shoots started, but died from lack of light.]\r\n\r\nWhen fields of sweet clover contain only a medium-heavy stand and when\r\nthe plants have made no more than a 30-inch growth, a 5 to 6 inch\r\nstubble usually will be sufficient to insure a second crop, but where\r\nfields contain heavy stands--15 to 25 plants to the square foot--it\r\nmay be necessary to leave an 8-inch stubble. In many fields examined\r\nin northern Illinois in June, 1916, heavy stands had been permitted to\r\nmake a growth of 36 to 40 inches before cutting. In a number of these\r\nfields a very large percentage of the plants were killed when an 8\r\nto 12 inch stubble was left. (See fig. 5.) A careful examination of\r\nsuch fields showed that the young branches had started on the lower\r\nportions of the stalks and had died from lack of light before cutting.\r\nIn semiarid regions, where the plants do not make as rapid growth as in\r\nhumid sections, they may, as a rule, be clipped somewhat closer to the\r\nground without injury.\r\n\r\nOn account of the difference in the growth that sweet clover makes\r\non different types of soil and on account of the difference in the\r\nthickness of the stand obtained in different fields, it is impossible\r\nto give any definite rule as to the proper height to cut the first crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Shoe sole to be placed on the inner shoe of the\r\nmower, so that a high stubble may be left when mowing sweet clover:\r\n_A_, End view of the back part of the sole; _B_, side view of the sole,\r\nshowing general shape; _C_, shape of the front end of the pole when\r\nit is to be used on mowers having shoes of the type used on Deering\r\nmachines; _D_, forward end of the sole represented in _B_. The toward\r\nend of the sole shown in _B_ and _D_ should be made for machines having\r\nshoes of the type used on McCormick mowers.]\r\n\r\nMOWER CHANGES FOR CUTTING SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nIt is good practice to replace the shoe soles of the mower with higher\r\nadjustable soles, so that a stubble up to 12 inches in height may be\r\nleft when cutting sweet clover, Shoe soles such as are shown in figures\r\n6 and 7 may be made on any farm provided with a blacksmith's forge,\r\nor they can be made at any blacksmith shop at a cost which should not\r\nexceed $2.50. Preferably they should be of strap iron, about one-fourth\r\nof an inch thick and 2 inches wide; however, old pieces of iron or\r\nsteel which may be found on the farm will serve the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Shoe sole to be Used on the outer shoe of the\r\nmower, so that a high stubble may be left when cutting sweet clover;\r\n_A_, End view of the back part of the sole; _B_, side view of the sole,\r\nshowing general shape; _C_, forward end of the sole to be used on\r\ncertain Deering machines; _D_, end view of the front part of sole shown\r\nin _B_.]\r\n\r\nThen these soles are to be placed on machines that have shoes of the\r\ntype used on the Deering mower, the forward 8 inches of the sole for\r\nthe inner shoe should be tapered gradually to a blunt point and bent\r\nin such a manner that it will hook into the slot in the shoe. (Fig. 6,\r\n_C_.) When the soles are to be placed on mowers having shoes of the\r\ntype used on McCormick machines, the forward 8 inches of the sole for\r\nthe inner shoe should be tapered gradually to about 1 inch in width,\r\nbent forward so that it will fit against that portion of the shoe where\r\nit is to be bolted, and have a hole of the proper size bored for the\r\nbolt three-fourths of an inch from the end. (Fig. 6, _B_ and _D_.) The\r\nbottom of the sole should be rounded, so as to run smoothly on the\r\nground when the cutter bar is raised to cut at different heights. The\r\nback portion of the sole should be upright and should have holes bored\r\nin it, so that it may be set for the cutter bar to rest at different\r\nheights from the ground. Preferably the lower hole of the upright\r\nshould be located so that when the bolt in the shoe is run through it\r\nthe cutter bar will be 6 inches from the ground. It should be long\r\nenough to permit four or five holes, 1 inch apart, to be bored above\r\nthe lower one. (Fig. 6, _A_.)\r\n\r\nWith some makes of machines it is not advisable to raise the cutter bar\r\nhigher than 10 inches from the ground, but when this is true the cutter\r\nbar may be tipped upward, so that a 12-inch stubble is left.\r\n\r\nThe forward end of the shoe sole to be used on the outer shoe should\r\nbe tapered gradually to 1 inch from the end. The forward inch should\r\nbe one-fourth of an inch in width and bent slightly upward and inward,\r\nso that a hook will be formed to fit into the slot in the front end of\r\nthe shoe. (Fig. 7, _B_.) The rest of the sole should curved, so that\r\nit will run smoothly on the ground when the cutter bar is set to cut\r\nat different heights. The upright which is bolted to the sole should\r\npreferably be made of three-eighths by 1 inch material and should\r\nhave six holes, 1 inch apart, bored in it, so that the outer end of\r\nthe cutter bar may be raised to the same height as the inner end. On\r\npractically all standard makes of mowers the outer shoe sole hooks into\r\nthe shoe instead of bolting to it, as is the case with the inner sole\r\non some machines. A wheel is used in place of a shoe sole on the outer\r\nend of the cutter bar on some machines. When this is the case, the\r\nupright to which this wheel is attached should be lengthened. On other\r\nmachines the forward end of the sole hooks into a slot in the shoe in\r\nthe same manner as the inner sole. In this event the front end of the\r\nsole should be bent slightly upward and outward. (Fig. 7, _C_.)\r\n\r\nBefore shoe soles are made for any mower a careful examination should\r\nbe made of the shoes to determine the exact size required and the\r\nmanner in which they should be attached to the forward ends of the\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURING AND HANDLING SWEET-CLOVER HAY.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest difficulties in curing sweet clover is the fact\r\nthat the plants usually are ready to be cut for hay at a time of\r\nthe year when weather conditions are likely to be unfavorable for\r\nhaymaking. Little trouble is experienced in curing this crop in the\r\ndrier sections of the country where the methods used for alfalfa are\r\nemployed. The curing of sweet clover is more difficult than the curing\r\nof either red clover or alfalfa, as the leaves are very apt to shatter\r\nbefore the stems are cured. Every possible means should be employed to\r\nsave the leaves, as these constitute the best part of the hay. (See\r\nTable II.)\r\n\r\nTable II.--Average analyses of the leaves of four samples of well-cured\r\nwhite sweet-clover hay.\r\n\r\n[Analyses made by the Bureau of Chemistry.]\r\n\r\n--------+-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        |          Constituents (per cent).\r\n        +----------+-------+---------+---------+-------+--------------\r\nSamples.| Moisture.|  Ash. | Ether   | Protein.| Crude | Nitrogen-free\r\n        |          |       | extract.|         | fiber.|   extract.\r\n--------+----------+-------+---------+---------+-------+--------------\r\n        |          |       |         |         |       |\r\nLeaves. |  8.70    | 10.92 |  3.09   |  28.20  |  9.28 |   39.78\r\nStems.  |  8.70    |  8.08 |   .70   |  10.16  | 39.45 |   33.06\r\n        |          |       |         |         |       |\r\n--------+----------+-------+---------+---------+-------+--------------\r\n\r\nThe hay collected for the above analyses represented the first cutting\r\nthe second season. The plants had made a 30 to 36 inch growth at the\r\ntime of cutting. It will be seen that the protein content of the leaves\r\nis almost three times as great as that of the stems.\r\n\r\nIn the drier sections of the country or when the first crop of the year\r\nof seeding is cut for hay in the North-Central States the mower may be\r\nstarted in the morning as soon as the dew is off. The hay should remain\r\nin the swath until the following day, or until it is well wilted, when\r\nit should be raked into small windrows. After remaining in the windrows\r\nfor a day it may be placed in small cocks to cure. Cocks made from hay\r\nwhich has dried to this stage will not shed water well and therefore\r\nshould be covered if it is likely to rain. It is important that the\r\ncocks be made small enough to be thrown on the rack entire, as many\r\nleaves will be lost if it is necessary to tear them apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Sweat clover curing in the cock.]\r\n\r\nWhen sweet clover is permitted to dry in the swath, a large percentage\r\nof the leaves will be lost in windrowing and loading unless handled\r\nwith the utmost care. Hay in this condition should never be raked while\r\nperfectly dry and brittle, but should be raked into the windrow in the\r\nearly morning or in the evening, when it is slightly damp from dew. It\r\nmay then be hauled to the barn or stack after remaining in the windrow\r\nfor a day.\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful methods for handling sweet-clover hay,\r\nespecially in regions where rains are likely to occur at haying time,\r\nis to permit the plants to remain in the swath until they are well\r\nwilted or just before the leaves begin to cure. The hay should then\r\nbe raked into windrows and cocked at once (fig. 8). The cocks should\r\nbe made as high and as narrow as possible, as this will permit better\r\nventilation. In curing, the cocks will shrink from one-third to\r\none-half of their original size. It may take from 10 days to 2 weeks to\r\ncure sweet clover by this method, but when well cured all the leaves\r\nwill be intact and the hay will have an excellent color and aroma. When\r\nsweet clover is cocked at this time the leaves will cure flat and in\r\nsuch a manner that the cocks will readily shed water during heavy rains\r\n(fig. 9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--A cock of sweet-clover hay which has cured in\r\nexcellent condition and retained all of its leaves.]\r\n\r\nWhen sweet-clover hay is to be stacked it is highly desirable that some\r\nsort of foundation be made for the stack, so as to prevent the loss\r\nof the hay which otherwise would be on the ground. Several feet of\r\nstraw or grass are often used for this purpose, but still better is a\r\nfoundation of rails, posts, or boards placed in such a manner that air\r\nmay circulate under the stack.\r\n\r\nA cover should be provided for the stacks, either in the form of\r\na roof, a canvas, or long green grass. If none of these means is\r\npracticable a topping of perfectly green sweet clover will cure with\r\nthe leaves flat and will turn water nicely.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that hay made from either red clover or alfalfa will\r\noften undergo spontaneous combustion if put into the barn with too\r\nmuch external moisture upon it. No instances of spontaneous combustion\r\nin sweet-clover hay have been noted, but this may be due to the fact\r\nthat comparatively little sweet-clover hay is stored in barns. The same\r\nprecautions, therefore, should be taken with sweet-clover hay as with\r\nred clover or alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER AS A SILAGE CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country sweet clover is gaining in favor as a\r\nsilage crop, either alone or in mixtures with other plants. The silage\r\nmade from this plant will keep better than that made from most legumes,\r\nas it does not become slimy, as is so often the case with red clover or\r\nalfalfa silage. It produces a palatable feed, which should contain more\r\nprotein than well-matured corn silage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Filling the silo with sweet clover.]\r\n\r\nWhen sweet clover makes sufficient growth after grain harvest, or when\r\nseeded alone, it is not necessary to cut it for silage until fall. At\r\nthis time it may be run into the silo alone or in mixture with corn.\r\nExcellent results have been obtained by placing alternate loads of corn\r\nand sweet clover in the silo. (Fig. 10.)\r\n\r\nWhen the first crop the second season is not needed for pasturage,\r\nensiling may prove to be the most economical and profitable way of\r\nhandling it, as it is necessary to cut this crop for hay at a time of\r\nthe year when the weather conditions in humid regions are very likely\r\nto be unfavorable for haymaking. The large percentage of leaves which\r\nusually are lost from shattering when harvesting the hay will be saved\r\nwhen the crop is run into the silo.\r\n\r\nThe first crop the second season will produce approximately two-thirds\r\nas much silage to the acre as corn when it is cut at the time it should\r\nbe cut for hay. The second crop may then be harvested for seed. When\r\nsweet clover is handled in this manner, approximately two-thirds of the\r\ntotal corn acreage which would be cut for silage may be permitted to\r\nmature, as the first crop of sweet clover will replace the corn silage,\r\nwhile the seed crop ordinarily will bring as much per acre as the corn.\r\nIn addition to this, the roots and stubble will add large quantities of\r\nvegetable matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nSome farmers do not cut sweet clover for silage until it is in full\r\nbloom. When this is done, 10 to 12 tons of silage will be obtained per\r\nacre, but the plants will be killed by the mowing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Cutting sweet clover with a grain binder for\r\nsilage.]\r\n\r\nWhen the green plants are ensiled, the crop preferably should be cut\r\nwith a grain binder. (See illustration on title-page and fig. 11.) This\r\nwill solve the difficulty of cutting a high stubble and will at the\r\nsame time bind the plants so that they may be run through the silage\r\ncutter without difficulty. Green plants, and especially the first\r\ncrop of the second season, contain too much moisture to be run into\r\nthe silo immediately after cutting. In some cases quantities of juice\r\nhave been pressed out of the bottom of the silo, and as a result the\r\nsilage settled considerably. Analyses of the juice from one silo showed\r\nthat it contained 0.23 per cent protein and 2 per cent carbohydrates.\r\nThis loss of juice may be overcome by permitting the bundles to remain\r\nin the field just as they come from the binder until the plants are\r\nwilted thoroughly. Straw or corn stover may be placed in the bottom of\r\nthe silo to absorb some of the juice. If the plants contain too much\r\nmoisture it may be a good plan to mix some corn stover with the sweet\r\nclover as it is run into the silo.\r\n\r\nSeveral silos in Illinois have been filled with sweet-clover straw.\r\nWhen this is done it is necessary to add sufficient water to moisten\r\nthe dry stems. These stems become soft in a short time and ensile\r\nin good condition. When the seed crop is thrashed with either a\r\ngrain separator or a clover huller the stems are broken and crushed\r\nsufficiently to render it unnecessary to run them through a silage\r\ncutter. Care must be taken when ensiling the straw to add sufficient\r\nwater, if molding is to be avoided. It will probably be necessary\r\nto add water at the blower and also at the top of the silo. It is\r\nessential to tramp the straw thoroughly, so as to exclude as much air\r\nas possible. After the silo is filled it should be covered with a layer\r\nof green plants and thoroughly soaked with water.\r\n\r\nTable III gives analyses of several sample of sweet-clover silage as\r\ncompared to corn silage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable III.--_Composition of sweet-clover silage and well-matured corn\r\nsilage._\r\n\r\n ---------------+---------+---------------------------------------------\r\n                |         |    Constituents (per cent).\r\n                |         +------+------+--------+----------------+-----\r\n   Kind of      |         |      |      |        | Carbohydrates. |\r\n                | Number  |Water.| Ash. | Crude  +------+---------+\r\n    silage.     |   of    |      |      |protein.|      |Nitrogen-| Fat.\r\n                |analyses.|      |      |        |Fiber.|  free   |\r\n                |         |      |      |        |      | extract.|\r\n ---------------+---------+------+------+--------+------+---------+-----\r\n                |         |      |      |        |      |         |\r\n White sweet    |         |      |      |        |      |         |\r\n   clover;      |         |      |      |        |      |         |\r\n  First year's  |         |      |      |        |      |         |\r\n    growth[7]   |     1   | 73.7 | 1.73 |  3.17  |    20.8        | 0.65\r\n  First crop,   |         |      |      |        |      |         |\r\n    second      |         |      |      |        |      |         |\r\n    season[2]   |     1   | 73.7 | 2.57 |  2.05  | 8.06 |  12.32  | 1.27\r\n  Straw[8]      |     3   | 73.7 | 1.19 |  2.70  |13.59 |   8.33  |  .50\r\n Corn, well     |         |      |      |        |      |         |\r\n    matured[9]  |   121   | 73.7 | 1.70 |  2.10  | 6.30 |  15.40  |  .80\r\n                |         |      |      |        |      |         |\r\n ---------------+---------+------+------+--------+------+---------+-----\r\n\r\n[7] Analysed by the Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station.\r\n\r\n[8] Analysed by the Bureau of Chemistry.\r\n\r\n[9] Analyses compiled by Henry and Morrison.\r\n\r\nAs shown in Table III the analyses of the first and second years'\r\ngrowth of sweet clover compare favorably in food elements with corn\r\nsilage. It is to be expected that the silage made from the sweet clover\r\nstraw would contain less protein and carbohydrates than that made from\r\nthe entire plants, as most of the leaves shatter from sweet clover\r\nbefore the seed crop is cut. Considerable protein and carbohydrates\r\nwere lost from the silage made from the first crop the second season,\r\nas the plants were run into the silo as soon as they were cut. Much\r\njuice was pressed from the bottom of this silo. An analysis of this\r\njuice is given on page 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER AS A SOILING CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a soiling crop sweet clover has been used to only a very limited\r\nextent. The amperage yields of green matter vary from 6 to 15 tons per\r\nacre, The season for soiling may commence when the plants are 12 to\r\n15 inches high and continue until flower buds appear. An area of such\r\na size that the plants may be cut every four or five weeks should be\r\nselected. The plants should not be cut closer to the ground than 4\r\ninches during the first part of the season and 9 to 12 inches during\r\nthe latter part of the season. On account of the high protein content\r\nand the large amount of forage produced on a relatively small area,\r\nsweet clover may profitably be fed in this manner when more desirable\r\nsoiling crops are not to be had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER AS A FEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALATABILITY OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nThe woody growth of sweet clover as it reaches maturity and the bitter\r\ntaste due to coumarin have been the principal causes for live stock\r\nrefusing to eat it at first. On this account many farmers have assumed\r\nit to be worthless as a feed. It is a fact that stock seldom eat the\r\nhard, woody stems of mature plants, but it is true also that stock\r\neat sparingly of the coarse, fibrous growth of such legumes as red or\r\nmammoth clover when they have been permitted to mature and have lost\r\nmuch of their palatability. All kinds of stock will eat green sweet\r\nclover before it becomes woody, or hay which has been cut at the proper\r\ntime and well cured, after they have become accustomed to it. Many\r\ncases are on record in which cattle have refused alfalfa or red clover\r\nwhen sweet clover was accessible. Milch cows have been known to refuse\r\na ration of alfalfa hay when given to them for the first time. Western\r\nrange cattle which have never been fed corn very often refuse to eat\r\ncorn fodder, or even corn, for a short time, and instances have come\r\nunder observation in which they ate the dried husks and left the corn\r\nuneaten. When these cattle were turned on green grass the following\r\nspring they browsed on the dead grass of the preceding season's growth,\r\nwhich, presumably more closely resembled the grass to which they were\r\naccustomed. Such preliminary observations should never be taken as\r\nfinal, even when they represent the results of careful investigators.\r\nWhen cowpeas were first introduced into certain sections of this\r\ncountry much trouble was experienced in getting stock to eat the vines,\r\neither when cured into hay or made into ensilage. This difficulty,\r\nhowever, was soon overcome.\r\n\r\nIt is very true that stock which have never been pastured on sweet\r\nclover or fed on the hay must become accustomed to it before they will\r\neat it, but the fact that sweet clover is now being fed to stock in\r\nnearly every State indicates that the distaste for it can be overcome\r\neasily and successfully. As sweet clover usually starts growth earlier\r\nin the spring than other forage plants and as the early growth\r\npresumably contains less coumarin than older plants, stock seldom\r\nrefuse to eat it at this time. Properly cured hay is seldom refused by\r\nstock, especially if it is sprinkled with salt water when the animals\r\nare salt hungry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nSweet clover, like most legumes, contains a relatively high percentage\r\nof protein, thus making it a source of that valuable constituent of\r\nfeeds needed for growing stock and for the production of milk. Table\r\nIV shows the relative composition and digestibility of sweet clover as\r\ncompared to some other feeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable IV.--Composition and digestibility of sweet clover compared with\r\nthat of other forage crops.\r\n\r\nAVERAGE PERCENTAGE COMPOSITION OF SWEET CLOVER AND OTHER FORAGE CROPS.\r\n\r\n  -----------------+---------+--------------------------------------------\r\n                   |         |          Constituents (per cent).\r\n                   |         +------+-----+--------+----------------+-----\r\n                   |         |      |     |        |Carbohydrates.  |\r\n                   | Number  |      |     |        +------+---------+\r\n  Kinds of forage. |   of    |Water.| Ash.| Crude  |      |Nitrogen-| Fat.\r\n                   |analyses.|      |     |protein.|Fiber.|  free   |\r\n                   |         |      |     |               | extract.|\r\n  -----------------+---------+------+-----+--------+------+---------+-----\r\n                   |         |      |     |        |      |         |\r\n  Green crop:      |         |      |     |        |      |         |\r\n   Sweet clover[10]|     18  | 75.6 | 2.1 |   4.4  |  7.0 |  10.2   | 0.7\r\n   Alfalfa[10]     |    143  | 74.7 | 2.4 |   4.5  |  7.0 |  10.4   | 1.0\r\n   Red Clover[10]  |     85  | 73.8 | 2.1 |   4.1  |  7.3 |  11.7   | 1.0\r\n                   |         |      |     |        |      |         |\r\n  Hay (moisture-   |         |      |     |        |      |         |\r\n    free basis):   |         |      |     |        |      |         |\r\n   White sweet     |         |      |     |        |      |         |\r\n     clover[11]    |     37  | .... | 8.2 |  17.6  | 28.2 |  43.0   | 3.0\r\n   Yellow sweet    |         |      |     |        |      |         |\r\n     clover[11]    |      3  | .... | 6.4 |  15.8  | 35.6 |  39.0   | 2.6\r\n   Alfalfa[11]     |    211  | .... | 9.6 |  17.4  | 29.8 |  40.3   | 2.9\r\n   Red clover[11]  |     99  | .... | 7.0 |  15.6  | 27.7 |  44.9   | 3.9\r\n   Timothy[11]     |    194  | .... | 6.2 |   8.2  | 32.5 |  49.9   | 3.2\r\n  -----------------+---------+------+-----+--------+------+---------+-----\r\n\r\nDIGESTIBLE NUTRIENTS OF SWEET CLOVER AND OTHER FORAGE CROPS WHEN FED TO\r\nSHEEP.[12]\r\n\r\n  ----------------+----------+---------------------------------+---------\r\n                  |          | Digestible nutrients in 100     |\r\n                  |          |   pounds of air-dried hay.      |Nutritive\r\n                  |Dry matter+--------+--------+-------+-------+ratio.[13]\r\n  Kinds of forage.|  in 100  |Protein.|Carbohy-| Fat.  | Dry   |\r\n                  |  pounds. |        | drates.|       |matter.|\r\n  ----------------+----------+--------+--------+-------+-------+---------\r\n                  |          |        |        |       |       |\r\n  White sweet-    |          |        |        |       |       |\r\n    clover hay    |    92.2  | 11.88  |  36.68 | 0.49  | 56.12 | 1:3.2\r\n  Pea hay         |    93.1  | 11.24  |  48.55 |  .71  | 62.5  | 1:4.5\r\n  Alfalfa hay     |    92.2  | 11.73  |  42.38 |  .72  | 60.90 | 1:3.8\r\n  (second cutting)|          |        |        |       |       |\r\n  ----------------+----------+--------+--------+-------+-------+---------\r\n\r\n[10] Analyses taken from Henry and Morrison's \"Foods and Feeding.\"\r\n\r\n[11] Analyses compiled by the Bureau of Chemistry.\r\n\r\n[12] Experiments conducted by the Wyoming Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation.\r\n\r\n[13] The nutritive ratio is the ratio which exists between the\r\ndigestible crude protein and the combined digestible carbohydrates and\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nTable IV shows that the percentage composition of both green and cured\r\nsweet clover compares favorably with that of alfalfa and red clover.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting point shown in this table is that the\r\nfiber content of white sweet clover, whether green or cured into hay,\r\nis no greater than that of alfalfa. It is understood, however, that\r\nthe plants collected for these analyses were taken when they were\r\nat the proper stage for curing into hay. Table IV also shows that\r\nthe digestible nutrients of sweet clover when fed to sheep compare\r\nfavorably with alfalfa. It was stated that the sweet-clover hay used\r\nfor this experiment was stemmy and that it had not been cut until it\r\nhad become woody. The pea hay had passed the best stage for cutting\r\nwhen it was harvested, while the alfalfa hay was in excellent condition.\r\n\r\nIn a feeding experiment with sheep conducted by two students at\r\nthe Iowa State College it was found that the protein digested in\r\nsweet-clover feed alone was 69 per cent and that the addition of\r\ncorn to the hay ration increased the digestibility of sweet clover\r\nto 82 per cent. Alfalfa and red clover showed similar increases of\r\nthe digestibility of the protein content when corn was added to the\r\nration. The percentage of digestibility figured for the protein in\r\nthe corn was the average of a number of digestion experiments. The\r\nprobability is that the digestibility of the corn was also increased\r\nby the presence of the hay in the ration, so that not all the increase\r\nin the digestibility should be credited to the hay constituents of the\r\ndifferent rations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH SWEET CLOVER.\r\n\r\nFew agricultural experiment stations have carried on definite feeding\r\nexperiments to determine the value of sweet clover compared with other\r\nfeeds.\r\n\r\nThe South Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station reported an experiment\r\nin which lambs were fed on sweet-clover hay in comparison with alfalfa,\r\npea-vine, and prairie hay. In this experiment the lambs made a better\r\ngain at a less cost when fed sweet-clover hay than when fed pea-vine\r\nhay, but not as large a gain as when fed alfalfa hay. The results of\r\nthis experiment are shown in Table V.\r\n\r\nTable V.--Feeding experiment with lambs in South Dakota, showing the\r\ncomparative value of different kinds of hay as roughage.\r\n\r\n[Grain ration consists of oats and corn in all cases; roughage varies.]\r\n\r\n --------------+-------+--------+----------------+---------------+-------\r\n               |       |        | Average weight.|Required for 1 |\r\n               |       |        |                |pound of gain. |Average\r\n               |       |        +--------+-------+-------+-------+ daily\r\n               | Number|Duration|        |       |       |       |  gain\r\n  Roughage fed.|  of   |of test.|At be-  |At end.|Grain. |  Hay. |  per\r\n               | lambs.|        |ginning.|       |       |       |  head.\r\n --------------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n               |       |        |        |       |       |       |\r\n               |       | Days.  |Pounds. |Pounds.|Pounds.|Pounds.|Pounds.\r\n Prairie hay   |   16  |   67   |  83.6  | 107.9 |  5.09 |  2.35 |  0.36\r\n Pea-vine hay  |   10  |   67   |  83.6  | 107.3 |  5.40 |  3.15 |   .35\r\n Alfalfa hay   |    5  |   67   |  81.4  | 119.4 |  3.36 |  3.02 |   .56\r\n Sweet-clover  |   10  |   67   |  84.7  | 113.6 |  4.42 |  3.19 |   .43\r\n   hay         |       |        |        |       |       |       |\r\n --------------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nThe Wyoming Agricultural Experiment Station also performed an,\r\ninteresting experiment with lambs.

The steers which were fed corn silage and\r\nsweet-clover hay made an average daily gain of 2.45 pounds, at a cost\r\nof $4.34 per hundred pounds of gain, whereas the steers which were\r\nfed corn silage and red-clover hay made an average daily gain of 2.29\r\npounds, at a cost of $4.55 per hundred. The steers that were fed corn\r\nsilage and alfalfa hay made an average daily gain of 2.49 pounds, at\r\na cost of $4.30 per hundred. In computing the cost of the gains, corn\r\nsilage was valued at $3 per ton, alfalfa, red-clover, and sweet-clover\r\nhay at $10 per ton, and prairie hay at $6 per ton. The results of\r\nthis experiment, as given in Table VII, show that sweet-clover hay is\r\npractically equal to red-clover and alfalfa and greatly superior to\r\nprairie hay for roughage for steers.\r\n\r\nTable VII.--Feeding experiments with steers in South Dakota, showing\r\nthe value of sweet-clover hay as compared with some other kinds of hay.\r\n\r\n[Corn silage fed in all cases; kind of hay varies.]\r\n\r\n ------------+-------+--------+----------------+-------+---------------+------\r\n             |       |        |Average weight. |       |Feed per pound | Cost\r\n             |       |        +--------+-------+       |   of gain.    | per\r\n             |Number |        |  At    |       |Average+-------+-------+ 100\r\n             |  of   |Duration| begin- | At    | daily |       |       |pounds\r\n  Roughage.  |steers.|of test.|  ning. | end.  | gain. |Silage.| Hay.  |  of\r\n             |       |        |        |       |       |       |       | gain.\r\n ------------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------\r\n             |       | Days.  | Pounds.|Pounds.|Pounds.|Pounds.|Pounds.|\r\n  Red-clover |       |        |        |       |       |       |       |\r\n    hay      |    4  |   91   |   775  |   983 |  2.29 |   25  |  1.5  | $4.55\r\n             |       |        |        |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Sweet-     |       |        |        |       |       |       |       |\r\n   clover hay|    4  |   91   |   774  |   997 |  2.45 |   23  |  1.5  |  4.34\r\n             |       |        |        |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Alfalfa    |    4  |   91   |   775  | 1,005 |  2.49 |   23  |  1.6  |  4.30\r\n             |       |        |        |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Prairie    |    4  |   91   |   769  |   951 |  2.01 |   29  |  1.5  |  4.79\r\n     hay     |       |        |        |       |       |       |       |\r\n ------------+-------+--------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------\r\n\r\nThe results of these various experiments are being duplicated every\r\nyear by many feeders. Each year in the Middle West and Northwest many\r\ncattle that bring high prices are being fed with no other roughage than\r\nsweet-clover hay. Steers which have been pastured entirely on sweet\r\nclover have brought in the Chicago market $1 per hundredweight more\r\nthan ordinary grass-pastured stock marketed from the same locality and\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nExcellent results were obtained in Lee County, Ill., from feeding\r\nsteers sweet-clover silage made from plants which had matured a\r\nseed crop. For this experiment 91 head of steers 2 and 3 years old,\r\naveraging 1,008 pounds per head, were purchased at the Kansas City\r\nstock yards on November 16, 1915, at a cost of $6.30 per hundred.\r\nThese steers were shipped to a farm at Steward and immediately turned\r\non 120 acres of cornstalks. They were fed nothing in addition to the\r\ncornstalks until January 14, 1916, when they were put into the feed\r\nlot. While they were not weighed when turned into the feed lot, the\r\nowner of the steers stated that in his estimation they had gained\r\nbut little, if any. During the 60 days these steers were in the feed\r\nlot they were fed 25 bushels of snapped corn twice a day and as much\r\nsweet-clover silage as they would eat. These animals had access to\r\nsweet-clover straw during the first part of the feeding period, but\r\nafter this was consumed they had only oat straw as roughage. At the\r\nend of the feeding period they were sold on the Chicago market at the\r\naverage price of $8.25 per hundred, netting approximately $30 per head.\r\nThe average weight of these steers in the Chicago yards was 1,177\r\npounds, 169 pounds more than when purchased in Kansas City.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable feature of this experiment is the fact that the\r\nsteers were fed almost entirely material which would have been\r\nconsidered of little value by the average farmer. The corn which was\r\nfed tested 44 per cent moisture at the Rochelle, Ill., elevator, and 20\r\ncents per bushel was the best price offered for it.\r\n\r\nPresumably on account of wet weather during the fall of 1915, the\r\nsweet-clover seed crop was a failure in that section; in fact, the crop\r\nhad been cut for seed and part had been thrashed before it was decided\r\nthat the seed yield was not sufficient to pay for the thrashing. The\r\nremainder of the crop was then run into the silo and fed to the steers.\r\nThe leaves fall and the stems of this plant become hard and woody as\r\nthe seed matures. The crop therefore would have been worthless for\r\nfeed had it not been placed in the silo. As a rule, stock readily eat\r\nsweet-clover straw when the stems are broken and crushed by the hulling\r\nmachines. The sweet-clover straw which was used as roughage during the\r\nfirst part of the feeding period was from that part of the seed crop\r\nwhich had been thrashed.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feeding experiment was conducted on a farm at Rochelle,\r\nIll. On September 7, 1913, 29 head of 2-year-old steers, averaging\r\n836 pounds, were turned on 40 acres of sweet clover which had been\r\nseeded that spring with barley. These animals were pastured on the\r\nsweet clover until November 1 without additional feed. During this time\r\nthey made exceptionally large gains. From November 1 to December 11,\r\n28 head of these steers had access to an 80-acre field of cornstalks.\r\nOn December 11 they were put into the feed lot. During the time these\r\nsteers were on the cornstalks they barely held their gain, but during\r\nthe first 30 days they were in the feed lot they made an average daily\r\ngain of almost 3 pounds. In this period they received 215 bushels of\r\ncorn-and-cob meal and 16-3/4 tons of silage made from the first-year\r\ngrowth of sweet clover. During the next 30 days they received 388\r\nbushels of corn-and-cob meal and much less sweet-clover, silage.\r\nDuring this time they made an average daily gain of 2 pounds. When the\r\ncorn-and-cob meal ration was increased the steers ate less silage.\r\nThese cattle dressed 55-1/8 per cent at a Chicago packing house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER AS A SOIL-IMPROVING CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike many legumes, sweet clover will make a good growth on soils too\r\ndepleted in humus for profitable crop production. In addition to its\r\nability to grow and to produce a considerable quantity of forage on\r\nsuch soils, it will add much humus to them. The extensive root systems\r\ndo much toward breaking up the subsoil, thereby providing better\r\naeration and drainage. The effect of the large, deep roots in opening\r\nup the subsoil and providing better drainage is often very noticeable\r\nin the spring, as the land upon which sweet clover has grown for\r\nseveral years will be in a condition to plow earlier than the adjacent\r\nfields where it has not been grown. The roots are often one-eighth of\r\nan inch in diameter at a depth of 3 feet, and they decay in five to\r\neight weeks after the plants die. (Figs. 12 and 13.) The holes made by\r\nthe roots are left partly filled with a fibrous substance which permits\r\nrapid drainage. Sandy soils are benefited materially by the addition\r\nof humus and nitrogen, while hardpan often is broken up so completely\r\nthat alfalfa or other crops will readily grow on the land. The roots\r\nadd much organic matter to the layers of soil below the usual depth of\r\nplowing, while those in the surface soil, together with the stubble\r\nand stems, when the crop is plowed under, add more humus than possibly\r\nany other legume which may be grown in short rotations. Not only does\r\nthis crop add organic matter to the soil, but in common with other\r\nlegumes it has the power of fixing atmospheric nitrogen by means of the\r\nnitrogen-gathering bacteria in the nodules on the roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--A portion of a root of sweet clover, collected\r\n30 days after the seed crop had been cut. The cortex was so decayed\r\nthat it remained in the ground when the root was removed. Note that the\r\npith has largely disappeared and that the half-rotten central cylinder\r\nis all that remains.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--The same root shown in figure 12 after being\r\ncrushed between the thumb and forefinger. Illustrating how rapidly\r\nsweet-clover roots decay after the plants die. The holes left in the\r\nground by the rapid decay of the roots facilitate drainage.]\r\n\r\nThe ability of sweet clover to reclaim abandoned, run-down land has\r\nbeen demonstrated in northern Kentucky and in Alabama. In these regions\r\nmany farms were so depleted in nitrogen and humus by continuous\r\ncropping with nonleguminous crops that profitable yields could be\r\nobtained no longer, Through the use of this crop many of these farms\r\nhave been brought back to a fair state of fertility. Tests at the\r\nAlabama Agricultural Experiment Station show that the increased yield\r\nof corn following sweet clover which had occupied the land for two\r\nyears was 6-3/4 bushels per acre. The cotton grown on the land the\r\nsecond year showed an increase of 56 pounds per acre. The combined\r\nvalue of the increased yields of corn and cotton for the two years was\r\nestimated at $9.75. The total yield of hay for the two preceding years\r\nwas 6.8 tons per acre. In another experiment at this station cotton was\r\nplanted on land that had grown sweet clover the two previous years and\r\non land that had received an application of 18 tons of stable manure\r\nper acre. The sweet-clover plat produced 280 pounds of seed cotton the\r\nfirst year and 120 pounds of seed cotton the second year more than the\r\nplat which received the heavy application of manure.\r\n\r\nLand on which sweet clover had been grown for four years at the Ohio\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station yielded 26.9 bushels of wheat per acre\r\nas compared with 18.6 bushels on the check plat. Sweet clover was\r\nseeded at the Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station in the spring\r\nof 1912. One cutting of hay was removed that year and the following\r\nspring the field was plowed and planted to corn. The corn yielded\r\n58.8 bushels per acre as compared with 41.1 bushels per acre for an\r\nadjoining plat where rye was turned under. A number of tests have been\r\nconducted in southeastern Kansas which show clearly the value of sweet\r\nclover as a soil-improving crop for that section. The yield of wheat\r\nhas been increased as much as 7 bushels per acre and that of corn as\r\nmuch as 22 bushels per acre by plowing under the second-year growth of\r\nclover.\r\n\r\nAnnual yellow sweet clover is rapidly gaining in favor as a\r\ngreen-manure crop for orchards in the Southwest. In Arizona two plats\r\nseeded in October and plowed under in April yielded, respectively, 16\r\nand 17 tons of green matter to the acre. At the Arizona Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station annual yellow sweet clover, lupines, and alfalfa\r\nwere tested as green-manure crops for orchards. In this experiment the\r\nsweet clover clearly showed its superiority to lupines or alfalfa for\r\nthis purpose, as it yielded from 21 to 26 tons of green matter per\r\nacre, whereas the highest yield for the lupines was 10 tons and for the\r\nalfalfa 15 tons per acre.\r\n\r\nThe use of annual sweet clover as a green-manure crop in southern\r\nCalifornia has increased very rapidly in recent years, and this\r\nincreased use apparently has been justified by the results obtained\r\nwith it. One of the most interesting green-manure tests thus far noted\r\nwas conducted at the California Citrus Experiment Station. In this\r\nexperiment nine legume plats and eight nonlegume plats alternated\r\nwith each other. The 4-year average weight of green matter produced\r\non the sweet-clover plat was 14-3/4 tons per acre, whereas the 5-year\r\naverage weight of green matter produced by common vetch and Canada\r\nfield peas was 12 tons and 9 tons, respectively, per acre. On one\r\nseries of these plats corn was planted in rotation with the clover.\r\nThe average yield of shelled corn for four years was 46 bushels to\r\nthe acre on the sweet-clover plat, as compared with 35 bushels to the\r\nacre on the common-vetch plat and 40 bushels per acre on the field-pea\r\nplat. One barley plat receiving each year an application of 1,080\r\npounds of nitrate of soda gave an average yield of 41 bushels per acre.\r\nThe 2-year average yield of potatoes following sweet clover was 252\r\nbushels per acre, as compared with 171 bushels following common vetch\r\nand 234 bushels following field peas. Sweet clover has proved to be an\r\nexcellent plant to grow in rotation with sugar beets, as the 2-year\r\naverage for the beets following it was 19.8 tons per acre, as compared\r\nwith 15.3 tons following common vetch, and 17.6 tons following field\r\npeas.\r\n\r\nAnnual yellow sweet clover makes a profitable growth only in the South\r\nand Southwest and therefore should not be planted in any other section\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nIn those sections of the United States where the soils are low in humus\r\nit is to be strongly recommended that sweet clover be grown for green\r\nmanure. This method is being practiced in some sections of the country\r\nwith excellent results.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that sweet clover will not make a satisfactory\r\ngrowth on acid soils and that it is very essential to provide\r\ninoculation if the soil is not inoculated already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER IN ROTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs sweet clover is a biennial plant, it lends itself readily to short\r\nrotations. It may be seeded in the spring on winter grain or with\r\nspring grain, the same as red clover. It will produce at least as\r\nmuch pasturage the following fall as red clover, and in some parts of\r\nthe country a cutting of hay may be obtained after the grain harvest.\r\nThe following year the plants will produce two cuttings of hay or one\r\ncutting of hay and a seed crop. In some sections of the United States\r\nthis plant is replacing red clover in rotations, as it will succeed on\r\npoorer soils than red clover and will add much more humus to the soil.\r\nIt will withstand drought better than either red clover or alfalfa,\r\nand on this account its use in rotations may be extended into drier\r\nsections. As a rule the beneficial effect of sweet clover on the\r\nsubsequent crops is more marked than that of other legumes. This is\r\nespecially true with corn, and whenever possible corn should follow\r\nsweet clover in rotations. Root crops also are benefited by its use in\r\nrotations, as the large deep roots of sweet clover open up the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER AS A HONEY PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of the leading honey plants fail to secrete nectar in part of\r\nthe territory in which they are found, but white sweet clover ranks as\r\na valuable source of nectar wherever found in sufficient quantity in\r\nthe United States. The period of nectar secretion usually follows that\r\nof white and alsike clovers in the Northern States, and consequently\r\ncomes at a time when the colonies are strong enough to get the full\r\nbenefit of the secretion. The honey from white sweet clover is light in\r\ncolor, with a slight green tint, the flavor being mild and suggestive\r\nof vanilla. The characteristic flavor and color of the honey seem to\r\nbe less marked during a rapid secretion of nectar, In the irrigated\r\nportions of the West honey from white sweet clover is often mixed with\r\nthat from alfalfa.\r\n\r\nBeekeepers have long recognized the value of sweet clover as a source\r\nof nectar, and for years tons of seed have been sold annually by\r\ndealers in beekeepers' supplies. It has never been found profitable\r\nto cultivate any plant solely for nectar, and those beekeepers who\r\nwere primarily interested in the plant for bee forage have scattered\r\nthe seed chiefly in waste places and along railroad embankments and\r\nroadsides. A number of beekeepers who were also engaged in general\r\nfarming have for years utilized the plant for forage, and they were\r\namong the earliest to grow the plant for seed, so as to be able to\r\nsupply their fellow beekeepers. Sweet clover to-day is almost the\r\nonly plant which beekeepers seek to increase in waste lands in their\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThe yield of nectar from sweet clover is heavy, and a number of\r\nbeekeepers now market this honey in carload lots. Sweet clover is\r\nutilized for honey especially in Kentucky, in Iowa, and in Colorado and\r\nadjacent States. In Alabama and Mississippi a number of beekeepers are\r\nharvesting large crops chiefly from this source. The color and flavor\r\nmake this plant suitable for either comb or extracted honey.\r\n\r\nYellow sweet clover is perhaps as valuable for nectar as white sweet\r\nclover, but beekeepers have paid less attention to it. This is probably\r\ndue to the fact that the blooming period of the yellow species often\r\ncoincides with that of white and alsike clover, making it less valuable\r\nto the beekeeper. In sections where the quantity of white and alsike\r\nclover is limited and it is desired to plant sweet clover for bee\r\npasturage, a mixture of the white and yellow species is recommended, as\r\nthe yellow species will bloom from 10 to 14 days earlier than the white.\r\n\r\nWherever any of the species of sweet clover are cultivated, either\r\nfor forage or for seed, beekeeping is to be recommended as a valuable\r\nsource of additional income, and such locations are especially suitable\r\nfor extensive commercial beekeeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor typos may have been corrected.
