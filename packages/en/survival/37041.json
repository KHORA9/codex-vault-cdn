L. VANDEMARK, W. J. MILLER, W. C. KINNEY, JR., CARLOS RODRIGUEZ,\r\nand M. E. FRIEDMAN[A]\r\n\r\n  [A] This publication was prepared by N. L. VANDEMARK, Professor of\r\n  Dairy Physiology. Research reported herein was carried out\r\n  cooperatively by the senior author and W. J. MILLER, W. C. KINNEY,\r\n  JR., CARLOS RODRIGUEZ, and M. E. FRIEDMAN, formerly members of the\r\n  Department of Dairy Science.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first announcement in 1951 of the successful impregnation of a cow\r\nwith bull semen that had been frozen stimulated much interest and\r\nresearch in freezing as a method of preserving bull semen. Research\r\nduring the years following 1951 resulted in considerable progress and\r\nsuccess in using freezing as a means of holding semen for long periods\r\nof time without loss of fertility.\r\n\r\nBetween 1952 and 1957, research on many aspects of the preservation of\r\nbull semen at sub-zero temperatures was carried out in the Department of\r\nDairy Science at the University of Illinois. Many of these\r\ninvestigations have aided in perfecting the freezing technique that has\r\nbeen adapted for practical use. Some of these findings have been\r\npublished, but many items have gone unreported except for general\r\nreferences at scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this bulletin to bring together the results of\r\nseveral experiments carried out in connection with the freezing of bull\r\nsemen and to present a practical freezing procedure based on the results\r\nof these experiments and findings at other institutions. Persons\r\ninterested in the development of the procedures and the reasons why\r\ncertain steps are necessary in freezing semen will find the details in\r\nthe first part of this bulletin. Those interested only in the freezing\r\nprocedure may turn to page 35 where a practical method of freezing semen\r\nis described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY WORK ON FREEZING SEMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it has been known for a long time that various types of tissues\r\nand organisms can withstand freezing and are even preserved by freezing,\r\nthe first attempts at freezing sperm cells were made before the turn of\r\nthe century. In 1897, Davenport[1][B] found that human sperm would\r\nwithstand freezing. For thirty to forty years after that, little\r\nattention was paid to freezing as a possible means of preserving semen.\r\nAn excellent review of the early attempts to freeze sperm has been\r\nassembled by Polge and Parkes.[2] These investigators also gave a good\r\naccount of their work at the British National Institute of Medical\r\nResearch in London, where in 1949 they demonstrated that glycerol would\r\nprotect fowl sperm so that it would survive freezing. The next year they\r\nfound that bull sperm and the sperm of several other species were\r\nprotected by glycerol during freezing. During the same year, Emmens and\r\nBlackshaw[3] showed that ram and bull sperm would survive freezing. In\r\n1951 frozen semen was used to produce a calf in England and a lamb in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n  [B] These numbers refer to literature citations on page 38.\r\n\r\nThe highlights in the development of frozen semen have been covered by\r\nother reviews and reports. Interested persons will find the articles of\r\nPolge and Parkes[2] and Smith[4] especially good on the early history\r\nand theoretical aspects of freezing sperm. Later progress on the\r\nfreezing procedure has been reviewed and covered in a number of detailed\r\nreports.[5],[6],[7] Many items not covered in those articles have been\r\nassembled here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF SEMEN FOR FREEZING\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first considerations in freezing semen is that of deciding\r\nwhich semen samples are to be frozen. Since preservation of the\r\nsemen--the maintenance of the potential motility and especially the\r\nfertility of the sperm--is the primary aim, some attention should be\r\ndirected to the kind of semen sample that will withstand freezing. Do\r\nthe initial characteristics of the sample indicate whether the sperm\r\nwill withstand freezing? Does maturity of the sperm affect their\r\nfreezability?\r\n\r\n=Predicting freezability.= Estimates of semen quality in the past have\r\nbeen based in part on the numbers of sperm present in a fresh sample and\r\non the percentage and rate of motility shown by the sperm. These\r\ncharacteristics were used to determine the relationship between the\r\noriginal concentration of sperm (in the fresh, undiluted sample), the\r\npercentage and rate of sperm motility in the diluted samples just prior\r\nto freezing, and the percentage and rate of sperm motility following\r\nfreezing and thawing. From data collected before and after freezing and\r\nthawing 54 ejaculates, it was found that there was not a significant\r\ncorrelation between the number of sperm present in the original sample\r\nand the percent of motile sperm present after freezing and thawing (r =\r\n0.03). A highly significant correlation (r = 0.45) was found, however,\r\nbetween the percentages before freezing and after thawing. While this\r\ncorrelation coefficient was highly significant, its magnitude indicates\r\nthat only about one fifth of the variation in percentage of motile sperm\r\nobserved after freezing was accounted for by the motility of the sperm\r\nprior to freezing.\r\n\r\n=Freezability of first and second ejaculates.= In the early days of\r\nartificial breeding in this country, it was commonly believed that a\r\nsecond ejaculate collected a few minutes after the first resulted in a\r\nlarger ejaculate containing more sperm. With the development of the\r\nprocedure of stimulating sexual excitement by restraint prior to\r\ncollecting semen, this difference between first and second ejaculates\r\nhas been greatly reduced. Still it was noted that second ejaculates\r\nfrequently withstood freezing better than first ejaculates, even though\r\nrestraint and stimulation of the bull occurred prior to collection of\r\nthe first ejaculate. During the course of a number of experiments, it\r\nwas possible to compare the freezability of 2 ejaculates that were\r\ncollected a few minutes apart from the same bull. Two consecutive\r\nejaculates were obtained one or more times from 24 bulls so that a total\r\nof 58 comparisons could be made. The mean prefreezing and post-thawing\r\npercentages of motile sperm in first and second ejaculates are presented\r\nin Table 1.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of variance showed that in this comparison the differences\r\nbetween first and second ejaculates in sperm survival during freezing\r\nwere highly significant. A later comparison of 27 first and second\r\nejaculates from 26 bulls did not show as great a difference between\r\nfirst and second ejaculates in their ability to withstand freezing\r\n(Table 1).\r\n\r\nTable 1.--Comparison of the Freezability of First and Second Ejaculates\r\nTaken a Few Minutes Apart From the Same Bull\r\n\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n  Number     Number               Prefreezing  Post-thawing\r\n    of         of      Ejaculate   motility      motility    Survival\r\n  bulls    ejaculates              (percent)     (percent)   (percent)\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  24           58         1st         60            39          65\r\n                          2d          62            45          74\r\n  26           27         1st         60            36          60\r\n                          2d          65            40          61\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n=Freezability of several consecutive ejaculates.= The fact that second\r\nejaculates sometimes withstood freezing better than first ejaculates\r\nsuggested that the maturity of the sperm might be a factor affecting\r\nfreezability. An opportunity to check this idea came when 20\r\nconsecutive ejaculates were collected from each of 6 bulls within a\r\n4-hour period. The sperm in samples collected in this manner might be\r\nexpected to be less mature with each additional collection.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained in freezing several consecutive ejaculates are\r\nshown in Figure 1 as averages for the ejaculates from 6 bulls. In same\r\ninstances, there was an insufficient quantity of semen available to test\r\nthe freezability. (Procedure: Diluted to 30 x 10^{6} sperm per ml. with\r\n1:1 yolk-citrate, then cooled and glycerolated with an equal volume of\r\n14 percent glycerol (percent by volume) in 2.9 percent sodium citrate.\r\nFinal sperm concentration, 15 x 10^{6}. Equilibration time, 15 hours.\r\nFreezing rate, 2 deg. C. per minute from +5 deg. to -19 deg. C. then 4 deg. C. per\r\nminute from -19 deg. to -79 deg. C. Held frozen for 5 or more hours then thawed\r\nin water at 5 deg. C. and checked for motility.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Percent of motile sperm before and after freezing\r\nconsecutive ejaculates collected within a 4-hour period from each of 6\r\nbulls (Fig. 1)]\r\n\r\nIn general, the motility before freezing improved slightly from the\r\nfirst to the fourth to sixth ejaculate and then declined until about the\r\n12th or 14th ejaculate, at which point the prefreezing motility seemed\r\nto level off through the 20th ejaculate (Fig. 1). The percentage of\r\nmotile sperm found after freezing and thawing followed the same trend at\r\nan average level 10 to 15 percent lower than the prefreezing level. As\r\nis readily seen from the trend lines in Fig. 1, the difference between\r\nthe prefreezing motility and the post-thawing motility increased\r\ngradually after about the fifth ejaculate. Although the absolute\r\ndifference did not increase greatly, the percentage of survival after\r\nfreezing dropped from 81 percent on the first 5 ejaculates to 26.5\r\npercent on the last 5 (Table 2).\r\n\r\nTable 2.--Comparison of the Freezability of 20 Consecutive Ejaculates\r\nCollected Within a 4-Hour Period\r\n\r\n(Weighted averages for 6 bulls)\r\n\r\n  ===================================================================\r\n                   Number     Prefreezing   Post-thawing\r\n  Ejaculate          of        motility       motility     Survival\r\n                 ejaculates    (percent)     (percent)     (percent)\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1st to 5th         29           53.3          43.2          81.0\r\n  6th to 10th        26           43.8          30.2          69.0\r\n  11th to 15th       23           28.6          14.5          50.7\r\n  16th to 20th       19           18.1           4.8          26.5\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n=Freezability of epididymal sperm.= Since the freezability of bull semen\r\nseemed to be better in second than in first ejaculates and some\r\nimprovement in freezability was evident through the first 4 to 6\r\nejaculates taken consecutively, the question of whether epididymal sperm\r\nwould withstand freezing seemed to be important. Although when 20\r\ncollections were made, the later ejaculates no doubt contained fewer\r\nmature sperm, the lowered freezability could have been due to accessory\r\ngland secretions rather than changes in the sperm themselves. Removing\r\nsperm directly from the epididymis would eliminate any effect that the\r\naccessory gland secretions could be exerting. Further, if epididymal\r\nsperm could be frozen, obtaining and using semen from a bull shortly\r\nafter his death should be possible.\r\n\r\nTable 3.--Freezability of Sperm in Samples Taken From the Epididymides\r\n\r\n  =================================================\r\n            Prefreezing   Post-thawing\r\n  Bull       motility      motility      Survival\r\n            (percent)     (percent)      (percent)\r\n  -------------------------------------------------\r\n  1            50            40             80\r\n  2            40            13             32\r\n  3            60            15             25\r\n  4            30            15             50\r\n  5+6          40            25             62\r\n  Average      44            22             50\r\n  -------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo determine whether epididymal sperm would withstand freezing, the 12\r\nepididymides (cauda only) of 6 slaughtered bulls were flushed with\r\nsaline (0.9 percent) and the sperm obtained were frozen using the same\r\nprocedure as was used with the 20 consecutive ejaculates discussed\r\nearlier. Averages of the 2 epididymides from each bull are given in\r\nTable 3; the samples from bulls 5 and 6 were combined. From the data in\r\nTable 3, it is obvious that motile sperm were present after freezing and\r\nthawing epididymal samples. It is likely that further experience in\r\nhandling epididymal sperm may lead to improved results. Using frozen\r\nepididymal sperm from 2 bulls, Canadian workers have produced confirmed\r\npregnancies in 8 out of 12 cows.[8]\r\n\r\n=Freezability of washed sperm.= In the laboratory it is frequently\r\ndesirable to study sperm free of the seminal plasma in which they are\r\nejaculated. Sperm can be separated from the seminal plasma by\r\ncentrifugation, removal of the supernatant plasma, and resuspension in a\r\nsalt solution of known composition. Sometimes it is desirable to repeat\r\nthe process. This tends to wash the sperm with the salt solution and\r\nsperm handled in this way are called washed sperm.\r\n\r\nSperm cells centrifuged three times and washed twice in 0.9 percent\r\nsodium chloride solution withstood freezing well when finally\r\nresuspended and frozen in yolk-citrate diluent. The percentage of\r\nsurvival in three samples subjected to this treatment was 60 percent.\r\nThus it appears that the seminal plasma itself is not essential for\r\nejaculated sperm to survive the rigors of freezing. This is not\r\nsurprising, since it had already been found that epididymal sperm, which\r\nalso are free of accessory gland secretions, can withstand freezing and\r\nthawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTENDERS FOR FREEZING BULL SEMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth of the extenders that are widely used in routine storage of bull\r\nsemen at 5 deg. C. are used for freezing semen. These are the egg\r\nyolk-sodium citrate and whole or skimmilk extenders. Most of the\r\nresearch with extenders for freezing bull semen in this laboratory has\r\nbeen done with the yolk-citrate diluents.\r\n\r\n=Proportion of egg yolk in the final diluent.= Some early experiences\r\nwith a diluent consisting of one part yolk and one part 2.9 percent\r\nsodium citrate dihydrate in distilled water showed poor sperm survival\r\nfollowing freezing. The final mixture with this diluent consisted of\r\nabout 45 percent yolk. In other attempts at adding glycerol in order to\r\nfreeze semen, the final proportion of yolk was diminished and better\r\nsperm survival was obtained. Several experiments were carried out to\r\ntest the effect of varying levels of egg yolk.\r\n\r\nIn the first efforts to find the optimum level of egg yolk, the level\r\nof yolk in the final frozen mixture was varied from about 6 to 46\r\npercent. These levels were obtained by varying the proportion of yolk to\r\n2.9 percent citrate solution in the original extending media and also in\r\nthe media added in glycerolating the samples.\r\n\r\nSplit portions of 20 semen samples were frozen in each of the extender\r\ncombinations indicated in Table 4. The mean percentages of motile sperm\r\nfound before and after freezing and thawing are shown also. The highest\r\npercentages were found with extenders containing 23 and 24 percent yolk.\r\nThe highest percentage of yolk, resulting when a 1:1 (yolk to citrate)\r\nextender was used for both extending and glycerolating, proved to be\r\nmost detrimental to sperm survival during freezing. The lowest\r\npercentage of yolk used (6 percent) was not as effective in protecting\r\nsperm during freezing as the intermediate levels tested (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\nTable 4.--Effect of Egg-Yolk Level in Diluent on Freezability of Semen\r\n(Average of 20 semen samples)\r\n\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n                   Medium               Yolk in    Pre-      Post-     Sur-\r\n          ----------------------------   final    freezing  thawing   vival\r\n  Diluent  Extending   Glycerolating[C]   mix-    motility  motility  (per-\r\n          ------------ ----------------  ture[D] (percent) (percent)  cent)\r\n          yolk:citrate   yolk:citrate   (percent)\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1          1:1             1:1          45.7       65        5        8\r\n  2          1:1             1:3          34.9       64       27       42\r\n  3          1:3             1:1          33.6       63       33       52\r\n  4          1:1             0:1          24.2       64       39       61\r\n  5          1:3             1:3          22.8       63       37       59\r\n  6          1:3             0:1          12.1       59       33       56\r\n  7          1:7             1:7          11.4       56       35       62\r\n  8          1:7             0:1           6.0       52       26       50\r\n  9          1:15            1:15          5.7       49       25       51\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  [C] This mixture included 14 percent glycerol.\r\n\r\n  [D] The average initial sperm concentration was 900 x 10^{6}/ml.\r\n  Sufficient extender was added to give 30 x 10^{6}/ml. at the first\r\n  extension. Thus the final concentration was 15 x 10^{6} sperm/ml.\r\n  after glycerolization.\r\n\r\nSince rather large changes in the percentages of yolk were used in this\r\nexperiment, two further trials were conducted in which 16, 24, and 32\r\npercent yolk in the final mixture were compared, with the final citrate\r\npercentages held constant. In these tests, 16 and 24 percent yolk\r\nmaintained sperm better at all citrate levels tried than 32 percent\r\nyolk. The 16 percent level was slightly better at most of the levels of\r\ncitrate tested (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n=Citrate level in the final diluent.= The early work of the British\r\nindicated that a final citrate level near 2 percent in the diluent was\r\nsatisfactory for freezing bull sperm. Later, in a personal\r\ncommunication, Polge of the British group suggested that a citrate level\r\nof about 2.35 percent might be best with a final glycerol concentration\r\nof 7 percent. Some of the first attempts in this laboratory at\r\nestablishing the optimum yolk-to-citrate ratios are shown in Fig. 3. In\r\nthese experiments, the optimum levels of citrate appeared to be lower\r\nthan anticipated from the British work. Thus a more complex experiment\r\nwas set up to test a wider range of citrate levels using 16 and 24\r\npercent egg yolk in the final freezing mixture. The average percentages\r\nof motile sperm found after freezing 10 semen samples at each of the\r\ncitrate and yolk levels in this experiment are shown also in Fig. 3.\r\nLittle difference in freezability was found between citrate percentages\r\nof 1.55 and 1.95. When the rate of sperm motility following freezing and\r\nthawing was considered along with the percent of motile sperm, a slight\r\nadvantage was found with 16 percent yolk and a citrate concentration of\r\n1.55 percent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Percent of motile sperm after freezing and thawing semen\r\nin diluents containing various levels of egg yolk (Fig. 2)]\r\n\r\nFrom the results of these experiments, and from several reports in the\r\nliterature,[5],[6],[7],[9],[10] it appears that a diluting medium\r\nresulting in a final concentration of 16 to 25 percent yolk and 1.55 to\r\n2.2 percent sodium citrate dihydrate is highly satisfactory for\r\nfreezing.\r\n\r\n=Storing and freezing diluent.= In some instances it would be\r\nadvantageous to have prepared diluent on hand for use at any time. The\r\nsuitability of stored diluent was tested with a yolk-citrate (equal\r\nparts yolk and citrate without antibiotics added) diluent prepared and\r\nstored at 5 deg. C. for 0, 2, 5, 7, and 9 days. Seven semen samples were\r\ndiluted and frozen in these diluents. No difference was noted in the\r\nsurvival of sperm that could be attributed to the age of the diluent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Percent of motile sperm after freezing and thawing semen\r\nin diluents containing various levels of egg yolk and various\r\npercentages of sodium citrate (Fig. 3)]\r\n\r\nIn another trial, a similar diluent (1:1 yolk to citrate with 1000 units\r\nof penicillin and 5000 units of streptomycin) was prepared and stored in\r\nthe freezer compartment of a refrigerator at -15 deg. C. Upon thawing, it\r\nwas whitish in color and more viscous than freshly prepared diluent.\r\nExcept for the fact that the viscosity seemed to reduce the rate of\r\nsperm motility, this frozen diluent stored for 65 days compared\r\nfavorably with freshly prepared diluent for freezing semen.\r\n\r\n=Other diluents.= Without the protective action of egg yolk or milk, few\r\nbull sperm will survive freezing. Several diluents were compared on a\r\nlimited scale for freezing bull sperm. The results of these trials are\r\ncompiled in Table 5. In this trial the yolk-citrate extender served best\r\nin maintaining sperm motility during freezing. Yolk-phosphate and\r\nhomogenized whole milk were slightly less protective and yolk-saline\r\nseemed to furnish the least protection to sperm during freezing.\r\n\r\nA number of investigations in other laboratories have now proven that\r\nmilk can be used as effectively as the yolk-citrate diluent for freezing\r\nbull sperm.[6],[7]\r\n\r\nTable 5.--Comparison of the Freezability of 4 Semen Samples in Different\r\nExtenders\r\n\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n                Dilution      Pre-       Post-                 Motility\r\n  Extender        rate      freezing   thawing     Survival    after\r\n                (semen:     motility   motility   (percent)   storage[E]\r\n                extender)   (percent)  (percent)              (percent)\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Yolk-citrate    1:1          60         49          82          46\r\n                  1:10         53         45          85          36\r\n  Yolk-saline     1:1          57         29          51          28\r\n                  1:10         60         31          52          24\r\n  Yolk-phosphate  1:1          55         33          64          25\r\n                  1:10         60         43          72          25\r\n  Whole milk      1:1          60         40          67          35\r\n                  1:10         60         35          58          16\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  [E] Stored at 5 deg. C. for 7 hours after thawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDILUTION RATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first trials by the British at freezing bull semen were made with\r\nsamples containing many millions of sperm cells. In routine artificial\r\nbreeding, it is common to add extenders to semen so that one milliliter\r\nof diluted semen may contain only 10 million living sperm cells. (This\r\nnumber still insures optimal fertility.) Frequently the addition of 100\r\nor more parts of the yolk extender to each part of the original semen\r\nsample is possible without reducing the sperm numbers below 10 million\r\nper milliliter. No one knew if this process of dilution would affect the\r\nresistance of bull sperm to freezing. The effect of various rates of\r\ndilution on the freezability of bull sperm was tested with 10 semen\r\nsamples. The results, presented in Table 6, show that the numbers of\r\nsperm between 10 and 90 million per milliliter did not influence the\r\npercentage of sperm that survived freezing.\r\n\r\nIn a later trial it was found that sperm survival was slightly better at\r\nlower dilution rates than in the same samples frozen following dilution\r\nto 15 million sperm per milliliter. However, field trials with frozen\r\nsemen carried out by others, using sperm numbers as low as 15 million\r\nper milliliter of semen inseminated or even lower, have been highly\r\nsatisfactory.[11],[12]\r\n\r\nDuring the early studies in the Illinois laboratory, the effects of\r\nglycerol level were also tested.[13] These effects are discussed in the\r\nsection on glycerol additions beginning on page 17.\r\n\r\n=Effect of further dilution and refreezing after the initial freezing.=\r\nUnder some circumstances it might be advantageous to freeze semen with\r\na high concentration of sperm cells and then extend it further after\r\nthawing. With such a procedure less storage space is needed than when\r\ndilution is carried to the maximum before freezing. Two experiments were\r\nconducted to test the effects of dilution and storage at 5 deg. C. and\r\ndilution and refreezing following an initial freezing of concentrated\r\nsamples.\r\n\r\nTable 6.--Effect of Sperm Numbers and Glycerol Level in Final Mixture on\r\nFreezability of Bull Sperm at -79 deg.

Results for both tests are summarized in Table 7.\r\n\r\nFrom Table 7 it can be seen that refreezing following an initial\r\nfreezing further reduced the number of surviving sperm. The second\r\nfreezing was more detrimental to the portion of the samples extended to\r\n15 million sperm per milliliter than to the portion that was refrozen at\r\na higher sperm concentration. The percentage of motile sperm remained\r\nfairly high in the portions that were diluted to 15 million sperm and\r\nstored at 5 deg. C. However, in all cases, survival was best in the samples\r\nat the lower dilution levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLYCEROL ADDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the British procedure for freezing bull semen was first tried in\r\nthis country, many of the refinements of the technique still had not\r\nbeen defined. It was known that glycerol worked well in protecting sperm\r\nduring freezing. The effects of glycerol on sperm at 5 deg. C., the\r\nappropriate levels to use in freezing, and the manner of adding it were\r\nnot well established. Therefore, a number of trials were conducted in an\r\nattempt to establish the best procedures.\r\n\r\n=Effect of glycerol on sperm survival at 5 deg. C.= Since early work\r\nindicated the need for adding glycerol to diluted semen in order to\r\nprotect the sperm during freezing, it was considered important to\r\ndetermine the levels of glycerol that sperm would tolerate at 5 deg. C. Ten\r\nsemen samples were extended 1:9 (semen to diluent) in a 1:1 yolk-citrate\r\ndiluent (yolk to 2.9 percent sodium citrate dihydrate). Each sample was\r\nthen split into 6 portions and an equal volume of citrate solution\r\ncontaining glycerol was added slowly to each to bring the glycerol in\r\nthe final mixture to 0, 5, 10, 20, or 30 percent (by volume). These\r\nsamples were stored at 5 deg. C. and examined for motile sperm after 1, 3,\r\nand 7 days. The effects of glycerol levels on the percentage of sperm\r\nsurviving and the rate (or speed) of their forward motion (0 = no\r\nforward motion; 4 = extremely rapid progressive motility) are presented\r\nin Table 8.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of motile sperm decreased slightly at the higher levels\r\nof glycerol. The most noticeable effect of the increase in glycerol\r\nlevel was the reduction in the rate of forward motion of the sperm. At\r\nthe 30-percent level, the sperm moved slowly and could be seen to\r\nrotate as they moved forward. Some samples were checked after slowly\r\nbringing the diluent up to a level of 40 percent glycerol; the sperm\r\nseemed to be immobilized completely in this solution.\r\n\r\n=Glycerol levels for freezing semen.= The British procedure called for\r\nthe use of 10 percent glycerol in the final mixture of semen and\r\nextender prior to freezing. Yet, as shown in Table 6, in our laboratory\r\n5 percent glycerol resulted in the survival of a higher percentage of\r\nsperm than did 10 or 15 percent. In order to define more clearly the\r\noptimum glycerol level, several ejaculates of semen were subsampled and\r\nportions were frozen after the addition of yolk-citrate extender and\r\nglycerol in varying quantities. From Table 9 it can be seen that\r\nglycerol levels of 6 and 8 percent in the final mixture resulted in\r\nmaximum sperm survival during freezing. These results were confirmed in\r\ntests on the survival of sperm at 5 deg. C. storage for 3 days following\r\nfreezing and thawing with varying glycerol levels (see Table 10).\r\n\r\nThe results shown in Tables 9 and 10 were confirmed also in later\r\nexperiments. Thirty-six samples were subjected to various levels of\r\nglycerol and no significant difference in freezability was found between\r\n6 and 8 percent. Based on these findings, a glycerol level of 7 percent\r\nwas adopted for use in all experiments described in this bulletin,\r\nunless otherwise indicated. Results in a number of other laboratories\r\nhave agreed with our findings regarding the use of approximately 7\r\npercent glycerol with the yolk-citrate diluent.[5],[6],[7],[9],[10] With\r\nmilk as the extender, 10 to 13 percent glycerol has been preferred by\r\nsome.[5],[6],[7]\r\n\r\nTable 9.--Effect of Glycerol Level on Sperm Motility After Freezing to\r\n-79 deg.

Originally it was believed that the\r\nglycerol should be added in stages so that changes would occur\r\ngradually. However, there would be a saving in time if the entire amount\r\ncould be added at once. Also, if the glycerol addition could be made\r\nsoon after the dilution with egg yolk-citrate extender at room\r\ntemperature, time would be gained in processing the semen for use. Since\r\naging _in vitro_ is known to reduce the fertilizing ability of sperm,\r\nevery effort should be made to keep the processing time at a minimum.\r\nThe results of an experiment involving these items, along with that of\r\nhow much time should be allowed after the additions before freezing\r\n(equilibration time), are presented in Table 11. One can see that sperm\r\nsurvived freezing better when the diluted semen was cooled to 4.5 deg. C.\r\nbefore the glycerol was added. The survival at 10 deg. and 15.5 deg. C. was\r\nreduced with each rise in temperature. Thus, it appears that cooling to\r\nrefrigerator temperature (4-5 deg. C.) before adding the glycerol should be\r\na part of the routine procedure.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the results from adding the glycerol in 5, 3, and 1\r\nequal portions is given also in Table 11. Little difference in survival\r\nduring freezing was noted between the three rates of addition. Using 3\r\nequal additions resulted in slightly better results, but the advantage\r\nwas not statistically significant. While little difference was evident\r\nfrom adding the glycerol in 3 portions as compared to 1, many still use\r\n3 additions in the hope of obtaining a slightly better sperm survival.\r\nIn fact, some have gone to a procedure of adding the glycerol dropwise\r\nwith constant gentle agitation. This method has not been tested in this\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\n=Allowing sperm to equilibrate with the glycerol.= Allowing sperm to\r\nstand in the presence of glycerol is considered by some to be necessary\r\nin order that the glycerol penetrate the sperm heads before freezing.\r\nFrom the first successful attempts at freezing bull sperm came the\r\npractice of allowing 12 to 20 hours for this process of equilibration. A\r\nlong equilibration time results in aging the sperm. Data from a number\r\nof sources indicate that a drop of approximately 5 percent in fertility\r\nin the field occurs with each 24 hours of aging in the test tube. Thus\r\nit would seem desirable to reduce the equilibration time to a minimum\r\ncommensurate with good freezability in order to reduce the effects of\r\naging (at 5 deg. C.). Results of attempting to reduce equilibration time are\r\ngiven in Table 11. At 4.5 deg. C., little variation in motility following\r\nfreezing and thawing was found after equilibration times of 2, 6, and 18\r\nhours. At the higher temperatures of 10 deg. and 15.5 deg. C., the shortest\r\nequilibration time--2 hours--was slightly more detrimental with the\r\ndifferences significant at the 5-percent level at 15.5 deg. C. For all\r\ntemperatures combined, 6 hours was significantly better than 2 or 18\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n=Sugar additions and equilibration time.= Early in their experiences in\r\nfreezing semen, the Australian workers found a short equilibration\r\ntime--30 minutes--to be satisfactory if sugars were added to the\r\ndiluent.[5] This protective action of sugars during the equilibration\r\nperiod was confirmed in our investigations. The results of one phase of\r\nthis study are shown in Table 12. From these data it can be seen that\r\nthe presence of glucose or rhamnose at a level of 1.25 percent improved\r\nsperm survival during the period of equilibration. In another trial\r\nthese sugars and two others, arabinose and xylose, were tested for their\r\nprotective action in freezing semen. The percentages of surviving sperm\r\nremaining after the various steps in the freezing procedure with and\r\nwithout the presence of these sugars are shown in Table 13.\r\n\r\nTable 12.--Effect of Adding Sugars to Yolk-Citrate Diluent on Sperm\r\nMotility During Equilibration With Glycerol[J]\r\n\r\n  ============================================================\r\n                               Sperm motility (percent)\r\n                         -------------------------------------\r\n  Stage when observed    Glycerol     Glycerol      Glycerol\r\n                           only     and glucose   and rhamnose\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Fresh diluted semen       56           56            56\r\n  After glycerolization     54           54            54\r\n  After equilibration\r\n     2 hours                51           53            53\r\n     6 hours                48           52            53\r\n    12 hours                46           50            51\r\n    18 hours                40           46            46\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  [J] Glycerol level in the final frozen mixture was 7 percent. Sugars\r\n  were added to a level of 1.25 percent.\r\n\r\nThree of the sugars--glucose, arabinose, and rhamnose--protected the\r\nsperm during equilibration and freezing. Xylose was less effective, but\r\nits addition resulted in slightly better sperm survival than glycerol\r\nalone. It was found also that the methylene-blue reduction time\r\n(metabolic test for semen quality) was faster in samples to which the\r\nsugars had been added--after glycerolization, after equilibration, and\r\nafter freezing the samples. This is confirming evidence for the presence\r\nof more living and actively metabolizing sperm in the portions to which\r\nsugars had been added.\r\n\r\nTable 13.--Effect of Adding Sugars to Yolk-Citrate Diluent on Sperm\r\nMotility During the Freezing Procedures[K]\r\n\r\n(Average of 10 ejaculates)\r\n\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n                                   Sperm motility (percent)\r\n                       -------------------------------------------------\r\n  Stage of              Glycerol  Glycerol  Glycerol  Glycerol  Glycerol\r\n  observation            only       and        and      and       and\r\n                                  glucose   arabinose  xylose   rhamnose\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Fresh diluted semen      63        63        63        63        63\r\n  After glycerolization    54        55        54        57        60\r\n  After 18 hours\r\n    equilibration          39        43        44        39        46\r\n  After freezing to\r\n    -79 deg.

Sugars\r\n  were added to a level of 1.25 percent.\r\n\r\n=Substitutes for glycerol.= Since glycerol was so effective in\r\nprotecting sperm during freezing, many have assumed that related\r\ncompounds might be even better. Several compounds, some related to\r\nglycerol and some not, have been tried as substitutes for glycerol in\r\nthe freezing procedure. They include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol,\r\ntrimethylene glycol, mannitol, sorbitol, dextrans, and seminal-plasma\r\nproteins. None of these materials has been as effective as glycerol in\r\nprotecting sperm during freezing. In fact, several of the materials\r\nproved to be injurious to sperm prior to attempts to freeze the samples.\r\nWhile the work in our laboratory with these substances as glycerol\r\nsubstitutes was by no means finally conclusive, because of the many\r\npossible interactions of experimental conditions, sufficient data were\r\ngathered to lead us to abandon further study until greater promise of\r\nsuccess might be evident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING RATE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Effect of freezing rate on sperm survival.= Reports by one group of\r\nBritish workers in early trials on freezing bull semen indicated that\r\nthe rate of cooling in freezing should not exceed 2 deg. C. per minute\r\nbetween +5 deg. and -15 deg. C., although below -15 deg. C. the rate could be\r\nfaster. Another group expressed the view that semen could be plunged\r\ninto dry ice at -79 deg. C. after it had been cooled to -15 deg. C. To clarify\r\nthis part of the freezing procedure, 11 samples of semen were subdivided\r\nand portions of each were frozen at rates of 0.25 deg., 0.5 deg., 1.0 deg., 2.0 deg.,\r\nand 4.0 deg. C. drop per minute between +5 deg. and -20 deg. C. and then twice these\r\nrates between -20 deg. and -79 deg. C. Vials of each ejaculate at +5 deg. C. were\r\nalso plunged directly into an alcohol bath at -79 deg. C. The samples which\r\nwere cooled at the rates of 0.25 deg., 0.5 deg., 1.0 deg., 2.0 deg., and 4.0 deg. C. per\r\nminute had the following percentages of motile sperm after thawing: 30,\r\n40, 46, 44, and 44. A mean of 32 percent of the sperm in the samples\r\nthat were plunged directly into an alcohol bath at -79 deg. C. were motile\r\nafter thawing. There were no statistically significant differences among\r\nthe samples frozen at 1.0 deg., 2.0 deg. or 4.0 deg. C. per minute. All of the\r\nothers had significantly lower survival rates. Thus, it is obvious that\r\ntoo slow a cooling rate and plunging the samples directly into a -79 deg. C.\r\nbath from a temperature of +5 deg. C. cause greater harm to the sperm than\r\ncooling at a rate between 1.0 deg. and 4.0 deg. C. per minute.\r\n\r\nSome investigators have suggested that rapid cooling below -20 deg. C. is\r\nnot detrimental to frozen semen. This idea was tested in conjunction\r\nwith other experiments. Twenty-five samples cooled slowly (2 deg. C. per\r\nminute to -28 deg. C., then 4 deg. C. per minute to -79 deg. C.) showed 62 percent\r\nsperm survival compared with only 45 percent when cooled rapidly below\r\n-28 deg. C. (2 deg. C. per minute to -28 deg. C. then plunged into bath at -79 deg. C.).\r\nThus, rapid cooling was detrimental even after the critical temperature\r\nrange of +5 deg. C. to -20 deg. C. had been passed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cooling rates of diluted semen samples in plastic vials\r\nand in glass ampules (Fig. 4)]\r\n\r\n=Rate of cooling in plastic and in glass.= Plastic vials do not conduct\r\nthe cold as rapidly as glass ampules do. The temperature in both glass\r\nand plastic containers tends to lag behind the change in the bath in\r\nwhich they are immersed as is shown in Figure 4.\r\n\r\nTemperatures in the immersion bath were recorded in a 2-milliliter glass\r\nampule containing 1 milliliter diluted semen and in an 8-milliliter\r\nplastic vial containing 2.5 milliliters of diluted semen. A second\r\nplastic vial and glass ampule filled to capacity with diluted semen\r\nshowed a cooling rate almost identical to that shown in Figure 4. It was\r\nobvious from the comparison that samples in the plastic vials cooled\r\nslower than those in glass and that the volume of semen (at least the\r\nsmall volumes used) in the vials had little effect on the rate of\r\ncooling. In another experiment, it was shown that the volume of diluted\r\nsemen in the ampule to be frozen (0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 ml.) had little or no\r\neffect on the survival of the sperm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORAGE TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn freezing and storing bull sperm, an alcohol bath containing dry ice\r\nat a temperature of -79 deg. C. has been used as a cooling agent. In many\r\nareas, the availability of dry ice is limited and the cost is rather\r\nhigh. Mechanical means are available for obtaining temperatures as low\r\nas, or lower than, -79 deg. C. but for the most part they are expensive. If\r\nwarmer temperatures were suitable for storing frozen semen, the ordinary\r\ndeep-freeze, which operates at -15 deg. to -25 deg. C., might be used.\r\n\r\n=Storage at temperatures from -23 deg. to -79 deg. C.= In testing the effects of\r\nstorage temperatures on the survival of frozen bull sperm (in a diluent\r\ncontaining 7 percent glycerol), 9 ejaculates were frozen and kept at\r\n-23 deg., -37 deg., -51 deg., -65 deg., and -79 deg. C. The desired temperatures were\r\nmaintained by dropping pieces of dry ice into ethyl alcohol baths as\r\nneeded. Samples were thawed after 1 hour, 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days.\r\nAfter 1 hour, the samples maintained at the various temperatures\r\nexhibited approximately equal motility (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of freezing and storing bull sperm at various\r\ntemperatures on the sperm motility at thawing (average of 9 ejaculates)\r\n(Fig. 5)]\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1 day, samples stored at -79 deg. C. exhibited approximately\r\nthe same motility as did similar samples stored for 1 hour. The samples\r\nstored at -65 deg. C. had declined slightly in motility and those maintained\r\nat -51 deg. C. had only one-third the motility which they had displayed at 1\r\nhour. The samples at -23 deg. and -37 deg. C. exhibited practically no motility\r\nafter 1 day in storage. After 5 days, only 3 of the 8 ejaculates stored\r\nat -51 deg. C. showed motility upon thawing. Apparently detrimental changes\r\ntake place more rapidly when the samples are stored at temperatures\r\nwarmer than -65 deg. C. The nature of these changes has not been determined.\r\nReports from other laboratories indicate that storage temperatures much\r\nlower than -79 deg. C. are just as satisfactory as -79 deg. C.\r\n\r\nNo tests of the effects of storage at -79 deg. C. for periods longer than 51\r\ndays have been conducted in this laboratory. Portions of 12 ejaculates\r\nwere frozen and stored at -79 deg. C. for various periods. One portion of\r\neach of these was examined on the second, ninth, 16th and 51st day of\r\nstorage. The percent of motile sperm and rate of motility at each of\r\nthese examinations were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Day                       2     9    16    51\r\n  Percent of motile sperm  49    46    40    38\r\n  Rate of motility          2.5   2.3   2.2   2.2\r\n\r\nThe average prefreezing motility percentage for the above samples was\r\n58, with an average rate of motility of 2.9. It is apparent from these\r\nresults that the loss in motility was greatest due to the initial\r\nfreezing, and after that the drop was most pronounced during the first\r\n16 days of storage.\r\n\r\nThe British and the Australians have both reported the successful\r\nmaintenance of fertility in frozen semen stored at -79 deg. C. for over two\r\nyears.[5]\r\n\r\n=Use of higher glycerol levels and a -20 deg. C. storage temperature.= In\r\n1953, a report from Arkansas suggested that warmer storage temperatures\r\ncould be used if a high percentage of glycerol were included in the\r\nfreezing mixture.[7] To test the effectiveness of various glycerol\r\nlevels on protecting sperm stored at deep-freeze temperatures, glycerol\r\nlevels of 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, and 9.5 percent were used with portions of 4\r\nsemen samples. Survival in the portions frozen and stored at -20 deg. C. was\r\npoor compared with the portions reduced and held at -79 deg. C. In a second\r\nexperiment, 4 samples were subdivided and frozen with a final\r\nconcentration of 7, 11, 15, and 19 percent glycerol in the semen-diluent\r\nmixture. In this trial, poor results were obtained at -20 deg. C. except\r\nthat glycerol at a level of 19 percent protected the sperm more\r\neffectively than at lower levels. Maximal survival at -79 deg. C. was\r\nobtained at the 7-percent glycerol level. A final trial was run, using\r\nglycerol levels of 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, and 31 percent. The\r\npercentages of motile sperm present after storage at -79 deg. C. and -20 deg. C.\r\nare shown in Table 14.\r\n\r\nTable 14.--Effect of Glycerol Level and Storage Temperature on\r\nFreezability of Semen\r\n\r\n(Average of 8 ejaculates)\r\n\r\n  ================================================================\r\n  Storage       Glycerol    Sperm motility after storage (percent)\r\n  temperature   level       --------------------------------------\r\n  ( deg.C.)

(19 percent glycerol) contained\r\nonly one half as many motile sperm as were still present in the samples\r\nat -79 deg. C. (7 percent glycerol). After 42 hours of storage, the best\r\nsamples at -20 deg. C. contained only one-third the number of motile sperm\r\nstill present in the samples stored at -79 deg. C. These trials leave little\r\ndoubt that under the present system of freezing and storing, storage at\r\nordinary deep-freeze temperatures is far inferior to storage at dry-ice\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAWING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of carefully controlled cooling and storage has been\r\nemphasized in the foregoing sections. The need for controlling thawing\r\nrates and the temperature of thawing was not clearly defined in the\r\nearly work on freezing bull semen. The British used a thawing\r\ntemperature of 40 deg. C., which was satisfactory. If there is a need to\r\nhold the semen for a time after thawing, then a lower thawing\r\ntemperature might be more desirable so that cooling again will not be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n=Comparison of thawing temperatures of 5 deg. C. and 38 deg. C.= The effects of\r\nthawing at temperatures of 38 deg. (body temperature) and 5 deg. C.\r\n(refrigerator temperature) were investigated. The first trial involved\r\nthawing as rapidly as possible by dropping glass ampules of frozen semen\r\ninto water baths at the two temperatures. The frozen semen samples\r\ncontained glycerol levels of 4, 6, 8, and 10 percent. The mean\r\npercentages of motile sperm found after thawing thirteen diluted semen\r\nsamples treated in this manner are shown in Figure 6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of glycerol percentage and thawing temperature on\r\nsperm motility after freezing and thawing (Fig. 6)]\r\n\r\nThe 5 deg. C. thawing temperature resulted in a higher percentage of sperm\r\nsurvival at all the glycerol levels than 38 deg. C., with the difference in\r\nfavor of 5 deg. C. becoming greater as the glycerol level increased. The\r\nreason for the interaction between glycerol level and thawing\r\ntemperature is not known. It may be that the presence of the higher\r\nlevels of glycerol at 38 deg. C. brought about harmful metabolic activity.\r\nThe difference in survival of sperm in semen thawed at 5 deg. C. and at 38 deg.\r\nC. continued during storage at 5 deg. C. (Table 15). It was also evident\r\nthat the interaction between glycerol level and thawing temperature\r\ncontinued during storage (Fig. 7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of thawing temperature on sperm motility during\r\nstorage at 5 deg. C. following freezing and thawing (Fig. 7)]\r\n\r\nTable 15.--Effect of Glycerol Level, Thawing Temperature, and Storage at\r\n5 deg. C.

Survival of the sperm with 4\r\npercent glycerol was so poor that only a few breedings were made with\r\nthese samples. Even at 7 and 10 percent, the fertility results were much\r\nlower than with semen that had not been subjected to freezing. At that\r\ntime it was felt that thawing the samples and using them throughout the\r\nday may have caused the low fertility results. Since then, a\r\nlarge-scale experiment by Cornell University investigators, in\r\ncooperation with the New York Artificial Breeders' Cooperative, has\r\nshown definitely that thawing should be delayed until a few minutes\r\nprior to breeding.[11] If the semen is used immediately, a thawing\r\ntemperature of either 5 deg. or 38 deg. C. appears to be suitable. However,\r\nthere is less danger of cold shock due to recooling if 5 deg. C is used.\r\n\r\n=Thawing rate in plastic and in glass.= Glass ampules transmit cold or\r\nheat more readily than plastic ones. The temperature rise is rapid in\r\nboth glass and plastic when samples are taken from the storage box at\r\n-79 deg. C. and placed in water at 5 deg. C. However, complete thawing occurs\r\nmore rapidly in glass than in plastic ampules. The changes in\r\ntemperature that occurred when glass and plastic ampules were thawed in\r\na water bath at 5 deg. C. are shown in Figure 8. The initial temperature\r\nrise for the first minute or two was about the same, then the rate of\r\nwarming in the plastic slowed and actual melting of the frozen sample\r\noccurred a little over a minute later in the plastic than it did in the\r\nglass. Both were thawed in less than four minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Warming rates of diluted semen samples in plastic vials\r\nand in glass ampules (Fig. 8)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF FREEZING PROCEDURES ON METABOLIC ACTIVITY OF BULL SPERM\r\n\r\n\r\nBy finding how methods of handling affect the sperm cells, one can\r\nsometimes improve the procedures to avoid harmful effects. Some attempts\r\nhave been made in this laboratory to determine the effects of the\r\nfreezing procedures on the metabolic activity of bull spermatozoa. These\r\ninvestigations have been limited in scope, involving the measurement of\r\noxygen-consumption and estimates of sperm motility during and after\r\nincubation at 37 deg. C. in a Warburg apparatus.\r\n\r\n=Effect of glycerol additions on oxygen uptake of diluted semen at 37 deg.\r\nC.= The effect of adding glycerol to diluted semen on oxygen consumption\r\nof the sperm was tested in a Warburg apparatus, using semen diluted with\r\nan extender consisting of one part egg yolk and one part 2.9 percent\r\nsodium citrate dihydrate. The yolk-citrate extender was added to the\r\nsemen at a rate which brought the sperm concentration in 0.5 milliliter\r\nto 200 million to 500 million. An exact count was used to calculate the\r\noxygen uptake per 10^{8} sperm per hour (ZO_{2}).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of glycerol additions on oxygen consumption of\r\nsperm at 37 deg. C. (Fig. 9)]\r\n\r\nGlycerol in various percentages in 2.9 percent sodium citrate dihydrate\r\nsolution was placed in the sidearm of the Warburg flasks. The diluted\r\nsemen was held in the main compartment. After a 60-minute preliminary\r\nrun, in which the rate of oxygen uptake of the sperm in yolk-citrate\r\ndiluent was determined, the contents of the sidearm were tipped into the\r\nmain compartment. The resulting glycerol percentages after mixing the\r\nsidearm and main compartment contents were 0, 4, 8, and 12 percent. Ten\r\nsamples of semen were subsampled and the oxygen uptake of each was\r\ndetermined at all four levels of glycerol.\r\n\r\nOxygen uptake was increasingly stimulated during the first 20-minute\r\ninterval by each increase in the amount of glycerol added (Fig. 9).\r\nAfter the first 20 minutes, the rate of oxygen utilization decreased at\r\nthe two higher levels of glycerol but persisted at 4 percent. The rate\r\nof oxygen consumption for the first 20-minute period at the 4-percent\r\nglycerol level was 130 percent that of the control to which only sodium\r\ncitrate had been added. At 8 and 12 percent the values for the period\r\nwere 144 and 192 percent, respectively, of the control rate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of glycerol and glycerol-plus-catalase additions\r\non sperm motility during incubation at 37 deg. C. (Fig. 10)]\r\n\r\nWith each increase in glycerol level, motility was reduced during the\r\nincubation period. This is shown in Figure 10 along with the effect on\r\nmotility of adding catalase, which is discussed in the next section.\r\n\r\n=Effect of glycerol-plus-catalase on oxygen uptake of diluted semen.=\r\nCertain bacteria have been shown to break glycerol down, forming\r\nhydrogen peroxide as follows:\r\n\r\n  Glycerol + oxygen --> lactic acid + hydrogen peroxide.\r\n\r\nHydrogen peroxide is known to be detrimental to sperm. The addition of\r\nglycerol to diluted semen first increased oxygen uptake and then reduced\r\nit. Since a reduction in sperm survival followed, some harmful action\r\nmust have taken place with the addition of glycerol at 37 deg. C. To test\r\nwhether this action could be due to the release of hydrogen peroxide as\r\noccurs in certain bacteria, glycerol with catalase--the enzyme which\r\nbreaks down hydrogen peroxide--was added to a portion of 8 diluted semen\r\nsamples and the oxygen uptake was recorded. Comparison of the resulting\r\noxygen uptake with glycerol and with glycerol plus catalase is shown in\r\nFigure 11.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of additions of glycerol-plus-catalase on oxygen\r\nconsumption of sperm at 37 deg. C. (Fig. 11)]\r\n\r\nOxygen consumption was increased by the presence of added catalase at\r\nall glycerol levels and in the control. Sperm survival during the 3-hour\r\nperiod at 37 deg. C. also was improved by the presence of catalase (Fig.\r\n10). However, the general trend in oxygen consumption produced by the\r\naddition of glycerol was not changed greatly. The higher levels of\r\nglycerol still stimulated oxygen uptake during the first 20-minute\r\nperiod after the additions and then slowed the rate of oxygen\r\nutilization. The rate of utilization was generally higher during the\r\ntest period in the presence of catalase than without added catalase. It\r\nappeared that a part of the harmful effect of glycerol might be due to\r\nthe formation of hydrogen peroxide. Still, the detrimental effects of\r\nthe higher levels of glycerol were not completely removed.\r\n\r\nTable 16.--Effect of Freezing Procedures on Oxygen Utilization of Bull\r\nSperm in Yolk-Citrate Extender\r\n\r\n(Average of 5 ejaculates)\r\n\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n                                             Microliters of oxygen\r\n  Semen sample tested                        utilized per 10^{8} sperm\r\n                                             --------------------------\r\n                                             First hour    Second hour\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Fresh diluted semen                            10.3         8.1\r\n  Fresh diluted semen glycerol tipped in\r\n    at end of first hour                          9.7[L]     12.9[L]\r\n  Aged 20 to 24 hours at 5 deg.

The results obtained\r\nin these experiments confirmed the earlier findings that tipping\r\nglycerol directly into the diluted semen at 37 deg. C. caused an increase in\r\noxygen consumption (Table 16). All other steps in the freezing procedure\r\nhad little effect on oxygen consumption by the sperm. Except where\r\nglycerol was added during the determination, the rate of oxygen\r\nutilization was lower the second hour than during the first. The oxygen\r\nuptake of semen that had been frozen and thawed seemed to drop faster\r\nthan that of unfrozen samples.\r\n\r\n=Effect of freezing procedures on methylene-blue reduction time.= The\r\nmethylene-blue reduction test has been used as a means of measuring\r\nsemen quality and is dependent on the metabolic activity of the sperm.\r\nThe effects of various freezing procedures on the ability of samples to\r\ndecolorize methylene blue were determined with 10 semen samples. Sperm\r\nnumbers were standardized to 300 x 10^{6} cells per milliliter and the\r\ntime required for these cells to reduce a 1:40,000 solution of methylene\r\nblue was determined on freshly diluted semen, after the addition of\r\nglycerol, after equilibration, and after freezing and thawing. Portions\r\nof each diluted sample were tested at these stages of the procedure with\r\nglycerol alone added and with glycerol and various sugars added.\r\n\r\nA marked increase in the time required for the sperm to reduce methylene\r\nblue occurred when the glycerol was added (Table 17). This increase was\r\ngreatest in the portions with glycerol alone and with glycerol and\r\nglucose. The time increase was less pronounced in the presence of the\r\nthree pentose sugars used. Following equilibration, the samples regained\r\nthe ability to reduce methylene blue at a rate only slightly slower than\r\nwhen they were fresh. Freezing and storage of semen resulted in slower\r\nreduction of the methylene blue than was shown after equilibration with\r\nglycerol. Since freezing usually kills some of the sperm, a slowing of\r\nthe reduction time after freezing would be expected.\r\n\r\nTable 17.--Effect of Freezing Procedures on the Methylene-Blue Reduction\r\nTime of Bull Semen With and Without the Addition of Sugars[M]\r\n\r\n(Average of 10 ejaculates)\r\n\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n                            Methylene-blue reduction time (minutes)\r\n                        ------------------------------------------------\r\n                        Glycerol  Glycerol  Glycerol   Glycerol Glycerol\r\n                        only      and       and        and      and\r\n                                  glucose   arabinose  xylose   rhamnose\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Fresh semen             5.2       5.2       5.2        5.2       5.2\r\n  After glycerolization  26.4      25.2      17.3       14.3      19.4\r\n  After 18 hours\r\n    equilibration         7.4       6.5       6.4        5.3       6.2\r\n  Thawed immediately\r\n    after freezing       11.5      10.5       9.4        9.0       9.4\r\n  Thawed  48 hours\r\n    after freezing       14.3      10.2      11.3       10.1       9.5\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  [M] Glycerol level in the final frozen mixture was 7 percent. Sugars\r\n  were added to a level of 1.25 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL FREEZING PROCEDURE\r\n\r\n\r\nGood results usually can be obtained in freezing bull semen if care is\r\ntaken in collecting, diluting and processing the semen. Occasionally the\r\nsemen from certain bulls will not withstand freezing well. The reason\r\nfor this is not understood at present. However, carefully following the\r\ndirections and suggestions given below will usually produce satisfactory\r\nresults with semen samples that are of good quality at the start.\r\n\r\nExperience in the field has shown that fertility results with frozen\r\nsemen are usually slightly lower during the first few months than with\r\nliquid semen stored at 5 deg. C. (41 deg. F.). Most units that have worked with\r\nfrozen semen over a period of a few months are able to improve and do\r\nget fertility results as good as, or better than, obtained in their\r\nliquid semen program.\r\n\r\n=Collection of the semen.= In order to obtain the best possible semen\r\nfor freezing, care and cleanliness should be exercised in making the\r\ncollection. The artificial vagina, and the glassware used should be\r\nclean and dry. The underline of the bull should also be clean and dry.\r\nThe bull should be restrained near the teaser cow for a minute or two\r\nprior to collection in order to excite the flow of secretions prior to\r\nejaculation. Allowing the bull to mount the teaser once without serving\r\nthe artificial vagina is a good practice to use in properly stimulating\r\nthe bull before collection of the semen.\r\n\r\nIf the bull has not been used for three or four days, the collection of\r\na second ejaculate for freezing may be advisable. The second ejaculate\r\nseems to withstand freezing better than the first in many instances. A\r\nclean, dry artificial vagina should be used for each ejaculate\r\ncollected. Repeated collections in the same artificial vagina may result\r\nin contamination of the semen with bacteria, lubricating jelly and\r\nminute particles of dirt. The semen sample should be protected from\r\ncontamination and from sudden temperature drops (cold shock).\r\n\r\n=Preparation of extender.= A suitable egg yolk-citrate extender for\r\nfreezing bull semen can be prepared by the following procedure. One part\r\negg yolk (free of egg white and the membrane surrounding the yolk) is\r\nmixed with 4 parts 2.4 to 2.9 percent sodium citrate dihydrate solution.\r\nThe citrate is prepared with distilled water and then boiled or\r\nautoclaved. The citrate solution should be cooled before it is mixed\r\nwith the egg yolk. After the egg and citrate are mixed, 1000 units of\r\npenicillin and 1000 micrograms of streptomycin are added per milliliter\r\nof extender. Sulfanilamide should not be added. This extender can be\r\nprepared 12 to 24 hours before use if it is stored at refrigerator\r\ntemperature. The portion of the extender needed for the original\r\ndilution of the semen should be warmed to room temperature before it is\r\nmixed with the semen.\r\n\r\n=Dilution after collection.= As soon as possible after collection, the\r\nsemen sample should be diluted with the extender. The extender must be\r\nat the same temperature as the semen (room temperature) when the two are\r\nmixed together. At this time the semen can be partially diluted (1 part\r\nsemen to 4 parts of extender) or diluted to a sperm concentration twice\r\nthe final desired concentration (later in adding the glycerol for\r\nfreezing, the semen is diluted further with an equal volume of glycerol\r\ncontaining extender). The diluted semen is slowly cooled (1-1/2 to 2-1/2\r\nhours) to 5 deg. C. (41 deg. F.). Some units using frozen semen now allow the\r\nsemen to stand at 5 deg. C. for 5 to 6 hours before glycerolization to allow\r\nthe antibiotics to be more effective against any vibrio fetus organisms\r\nthat may be present. This step is taken because it has been shown that\r\nglycerol inhibits the effectiveness of the antibiotics.[6] After\r\ncooling, semen can be further diluted to twice the desired sperm\r\nconcentration if that were not done at the start. (Caution: Be sure\r\nsemen and diluent are at the same temperature.)\r\n\r\n=Adding the glycerol.= The glycerol solution is prepared by adding 14\r\nvolumes of glycerol (reagent grade) to 86 volumes of yolk-citrate\r\ndiluent (same as yolk-citrate used for original dilution). This solution\r\nmay be added dropwise with constant gentle mixing to the already diluted\r\nsemen, or one-third at a time at 10-minute intervals with gentle mixing\r\nduring each addition. Either method should take about 20 to 30 minutes.\r\nThe total volume of glycerol-yolk-citrate solution added should be equal\r\nto the volume of the original diluted semen. In this way a concentration\r\nof 7 percent glycerol is obtained in the final mixture that is to be\r\nfrozen. Care must be taken to keep the temperature at 5 deg. C. (41 deg. F.)\r\nduring the time the glycerol is being added. (A cold room is best for\r\nmaintaining a temperature of 5 deg. C., but with care the operation can be\r\ncarried out at room temperature by using pans of ice water and a\r\nrefrigerator.)\r\n\r\n=Equilibration.= The results presented in this bulletin suggest that\r\nlittle or no time need be allowed after the glycerol is added before\r\nfreezing. However, results obtained by other workers show improved\r\nfertility with at least 12 hours equilibration. Some units getting good\r\nfertility results with frozen semen also are allowing the semen to stand\r\nat 5 deg. C. for 12 to 18 hours before freezing. After the semen has\r\nequilibrated with the glycerol, 1-milliliter portions of the mixture are\r\nplaced in 1.2- to 2-milliliter vials or ampules which are then sealed.\r\nAmpuling can be done with an automatic syringe or pipette, provided a\r\nlarge gage needle is used. Also, it is important not to force the fluid\r\nmixture rapidly through the syringe or the sperm may be injured.\r\n\r\n=Freezing.= The vials or ampules of diluted semen are placed in a bath\r\nof isopropyl alcohol which has been cooled to 5 deg. C. (41 deg. F.). This bath\r\ncan be a wide-mouth thermos bottle or an insulated container of almost\r\nany sort with a large opening at the top. The size needed depends on the\r\nnumber of ampules being frozen. Some sort of convenient tray for holding\r\nthe ampules in an orderly fashion and enabling the samples to be\r\ncompletely submerged is desirable. A few ampules can be kept together\r\neasily by placing them in a polyethylene freezer bag that has had many\r\nsmall holes cut in it to let the alcohol of the bath contact the\r\nampules. The ampules must be completely covered by the alcohol to insure\r\nuniform cooling.\r\n\r\nThe alcohol of the bath and the ampules of semen are cooled by adding\r\nchipped or ground dry ice in sufficient amounts to lower the temperature\r\nof the bath 2 deg. C. (3.6 deg. F.) per minute from +5 deg. to -20 deg. C. From -20 deg.\r\ndown to -79 deg. C., the rate of cooling can be doubled (4 deg. C. or 7.2 deg. F.).\r\nElectrical equipment that regulates the cooling rate to the desired\r\ntemperatures is available commercially, but the cost may be too high for\r\nsome small operations. The samples should be held at -79 deg. C. (-110 deg. F.)\r\nuntil they are thawed. This can be done by using an alcohol bath and dry\r\nice or by special mechanical refrigerating equipment. At no time prior\r\nto thawing should the samples be exposed to warmer temperatures.\r\n\r\n=Thawing.= The ampules of frozen semen can be thawed by removing them\r\nfrom the dry ice storage box and dropping them into a water bath at 5 deg.\r\nC. (41 deg. F.). Thawing temperatures up to body temperature, 38 deg. C. (100 deg.\r\nF.), can be used but extreme care must then be taken not to pass the\r\nsemen through a cold inseminating tube; for this would subject the sperm\r\nto cold shock. The semen should be used for breeding within a few\r\nminutes after thawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\n\r\n     [1] DAVENPORT, C. B.
