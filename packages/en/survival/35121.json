It has been called a mineralogical vegetable; it is both\r\nfibrous and crystalline, elastic yet brittle; a floating stone, which\r\ncan be as readily carded, spun, and woven into tissue as cotton or the\r\nfinest silk.\r\n\r\nCalled by geologists \"asbestus\" (the termination in os being the\r\nadjective form of the word), the name of the mineral in its Greek form\r\nas commonly used (+asbestos+), signifies \"indestructible.\" The French\r\nadopt the same derivation, calling it \"asbeste\" (minèral filamenteux et\r\nincombustible). In Germany it is called \"steinflachs\" (stone-flax); and\r\nby the Italians \"amianto\" (from +amiantos+, pure, incorruptible);\r\nso-called because cloth made from it was cleansed by passing it through\r\nfire. Charlemagne, we are told, having a cloth made of this material in\r\nhis possession, one day after dinner astonished his rude warrior guests\r\nby throwing it in the fire, and then withdrawing it cleansed and\r\nunconsumed.\r\n\r\nAs a modern pendent to this well-known legend, the following is current\r\nin Quebec. A labouring man, who had left the old country to seek a\r\nbetter fortune in the Dominion, found employment at once on arrival in\r\none of the many lumber yards on the St. Lawrence, where his energy and\r\nactivity, supplemented by great bodily strength, soon secured for him a\r\ngood position. It so happened, however, that one evening, on returning\r\nfrom their daily toil to their common apartment, some of his\r\nfellow-workmen saw him deliberately throw himself into a seat, kick off\r\nhis boots, and then pull off his socks, and having opened the door of\r\nthe stove, coolly fling them in on to the mass of burning wood. Possibly\r\nno particular notice would have been taken of this, judged as a mere act\r\nof folly and waste on the part of the new-comer; but when, almost\r\nimmediately afterwards, they saw him open the stove door again, take out\r\nthe apparently blazing socks, and, after giving them a shake, proceed\r\njust as deliberately to draw them on to his feet again, that was a\r\ntrifle too much! Human nature could not stand that. Consequently the\r\nhorrified spectators, having for a moment looked on aghast, fled\r\nprecipitately from the room. To them the facts were clear enough. This,\r\nthey said, was no human being like themselves; such hellish practices\r\ncould have but one origin. If not the devil himself, this man certainly\r\ncould be no other than one of his emissaries. So off they went in a body\r\nto the manager and demanded his instant dismissal, loudly asseverating\r\nthat they would no longer eat, drink, or work in company with such a\r\nmonster. Enquiry being at once set on foot, it turned out that some time\r\nbefore leaving England the man had worked at an asbestos factory, where\r\nhe had learned to appreciate the valuable properties of this mineral;\r\nand being of an ingenious turn of mind, he had managed to procure some\r\nof the fiberized material and therewith knit himself a pair of socks,\r\nwhich he was accustomed to cleanse in the manner described. He was, as\r\nhas been said, an unusually good workman, consequently his employers had\r\nno wish to part with him. Explanation and expostulation, however, were\r\nall in vain; nothing could remove the horrible impression that his\r\nconduct had made upon the minds of his superstitious fellow-workmen; go\r\nhe must and did, nor could the tumult be in any way allayed until he had\r\nbeen dismissed from his work and had left the yard.\r\n\r\nLeaving this digression, however, it may be said that the peculiar\r\nproperties of the mineral were known long before Charlemagne's time. The\r\nancients, who believed it to be a plant, made a cere-cloth of it, in\r\nwhich they were accustomed to enwrap the bodies which were to be burned\r\non the funeral pyre, so that the ashes might be retained, separate and\r\nintact, for preservation in the family urn, an aperture being left in\r\nthe cloth to allow a free passage for the flames. How they succeeded in\r\nweaving this cloth is now unknown. It has been suggested that its\r\naccomplishment was effected by weaving the fibres along with those of\r\nflax, and then passing the whole through a furnace to burn out the flax.\r\n\r\nThe lamps used by the vestal virgins are also said to have been\r\nfurnished with asbestos wicks, so that the modern adaptation of it to\r\nthis purpose is only another exemplification of the truth of Solomon's\r\nsaying that \"there is nothing new under the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe mineral has been variously described. In general terms it may be\r\nsaid to be a fibrous variety of serpentine, closely allied to the\r\nhornblende family of minerals, the Canadian variety of which is called\r\nby mineralogists \"chrysotile.\" In the local vernacular of the mining\r\ndistricts this is \"pierre-à-coton\" (cotton-stone), perhaps as expressive\r\na term as can be found.\r\n\r\nThe ore takes a variety of forms; much of it (especially that found in\r\nthe States) is of a coarse woody character, of but little value for\r\nmercantile purposes.\r\n\r\nSir William Logan, in his \"Geology of Canada,\" says that foliated and\r\nfibrous varieties of serpentine are common in veins of the ophiolites of\r\nthe Silurian series, constituting the varieties which have been\r\ndescribed under the various names of baltimorite, marmolite, picrolite,\r\nand chrysotile. The true asbestos, however, he says, is a fibrous\r\nvariety of tremolite or hornblende.\r\n\r\nIn _Le Génie Civil_ for September, 1883, Canadian asbestos is thus\r\ndescribed: \"La chrysotile du Canada n'est pas comme l'amiante ordinaire\r\nformée d'un paquet de fils d'un blanc verdâtre et remplissant des\r\ncavités irrégulières: c'est une véritable pierre d'une densité comprise\r\nentre 2 et 3, qui se trouve en couches de 3 à 10 centimètres\r\nd'épaisseur. Cette pierre possède la propriété de se reduire en fibres\r\nperpendiculairement à sa longueur sous un effort très faible. Ses fibres\r\ntransversales sont plus résistantes et beaucoup plus facile à filer, à\r\ntisser, et à feutrer que l'amiante ordinaire.\" This is as good a\r\ndescription of chrysotile as can be found anywhere.\r\n\r\nUntil the discovery of the Canadian mines, the variety here spoken of as\r\namiante (amianthus), was esteemed the most rare and delicate kind, on\r\naccount of its beautifully white, flexible, long, and delicately laid\r\nfibres. This variety is generally found buried in the centre of the\r\nolder crystalline rocks in the Pyrenees, the Alps of Dauphiny, on Mount\r\nSt. Gothard, in North America, in the serpentines of Sweden, the Ural\r\nMountains, Silesia, and New South Wales. The most beautiful specimens,\r\nsuch as are preserved in museums and mineralogical collections, have\r\nmostly been brought from Tarantaise in Savoy, or from Corsica.[1] In\r\nthis latter place it is said to be so abundant that, its mercantile\r\nvalue being unknown, it has often been used, instead of tow, as a\r\nmaterial for packing.\r\n\r\nIn a handbook published by the Dominion Government in 1882 (before the\r\ndiscovery of the mines of chrysotile) on the mineral resources of\r\nCanada, it is said that--\r\n\r\n\"What is commercially known as asbestos is really a term used to denote\r\na peculiar fibrous form assumed by several distinct minerals, rather\r\nthan to designate any particular species. Tremolite, actinolite, and\r\nother forms of hornblende and serpentine, passing into fibrous\r\nvarieties, assume the name of asbestos, and the 'Geology of Canada' does\r\nnot give the mineral as a distinct one, but recognizes it under these\r\ndifferent headings. As yet comparatively little asbestos has been found\r\nin Canada.\"\r\n\r\nThis is sufficient to show how small was the interest, even so recently\r\nas that, attaching to this substance in the very country which was so\r\nsoon to find it taking important rank amongst her natural productions.\r\n\r\nThat singularly beautiful mineral termed \"crocidolite,\" which displays\r\nsuch sheens and radiances of gold and bronze and green as give it the\r\nappearance of satin changed into stone, is nothing more than compressed\r\nasbestos. The derivation of its name is not happy. It is said to be from\r\n+krokos lithos+, simply crocus-coloured or yellow stone. This is\r\ndoubtless its general colour, but the finest crocidolite is anything but\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nHaving heard that there were some fine specimens of asbestos on view at\r\nthe recent exhibition of the United States products at Earl's Court, I\r\nmade a journey there specially to see them. In this, however, I was\r\ndisappointed. There was but one small tray of so-called asbestos\r\n(amphibole) on view; and this was of a coarse woody character, very\r\nsimilar in appearance to a sample I had had sent to me recently from\r\nCalifornia. It was, moreover, of a very poor colour and certainly not of\r\nthe kind that would readily find a market. I found there, however, a\r\npiece of unmistakable chrysotile, grouped amongst a miscellaneous lot of\r\nAmerican minerals. The exhibitor at once told me, in reply to my\r\nquestions, that this was not an American product at all, but that it was\r\na \"vegetable matter\" found in Canada. He evidently did not know much\r\nabout it, and said it was not asbestos at all. It was not by any means a\r\nfine specimen: it had somewhat the appearance of ordinary Thetford No.\r\n1, though differing slightly in colour. I could get no further\r\ninformation about it, except that it had come from near Ottawa.\r\n\r\nAt this exhibition I found a splendid display of crocidolite, the sight\r\nof which well repaid the visit. I secured a good specimen, but found, on\r\nenquiry, that like all the superior qualities of this mineral, it had\r\nbeen brought from Griqualand (South Africa). The sample I secured was of\r\nthe kind that in the States is called \"Tiger-eye,\" as I presume, from\r\nits general tawny-coloured streaky brilliancy. The exhibitor said it was\r\na silicate of iron occurring in asbestos-like fibres. It is of an\r\nexceedingly hard, densely compact nature; from its hardness difficult to\r\nwork, but susceptible of a very high polish. A few years ago it was\r\nthought to be a precious stone and accordingly commanded a high price,\r\nbut recent discoveries of large deposits considerably reduced its value.\r\nIt is used for a variety of ornamental purposes, for which, from its\r\nextreme natural beauty, it is peculiarly adapted. The grain is very fine\r\nand in its rough state the fibres are singularly distinct.\r\n\r\nThere is another very singular substance worth alluding to here, which\r\nis often put forward as a substitute for asbestos, and which is said by\r\nthe manufacturers to be fireproof, frost-proof, vermin-proof,\r\nsound-proof, indestructible, and odourless. This is a good deal to say,\r\nbut is in a great measure true. It is largely used in the United Slates,\r\nespecially for insulating and other purposes of a like kind. I mean the\r\nartificially manufactured material called \"Mineral or Slag Wool,\" which\r\nis made from the refuse of the furnaces at ironworks, by, it is said,\r\npassing jets of steam through molten slag. This material is manufactured\r\non a somewhat extensive scale by the Western Mineral Wool Company, of\r\nCleveland, Ohio. There is no doubt it is a very useful substance for\r\nmany of the purposes for which it is recommended, but it can scarcely be\r\nexpected to compete to any material extent with asbestos from its total\r\nwant of elasticity and lubricity. Even the finest quality on being\r\ncrushed between the fingers has a harsh, gritty, metallic feeling, very\r\ndifferent from the silky, springy, and greasy feel of the natural fibre.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this manufactured article, a very curious natural\r\nproduction is called to mind, the origin of which is somewhat similar\r\nthough brought about by natural causes. I refer to the product of the\r\nlava-beds of Hawaii, called by the natives \"Pélé's hair.\" Miss C. F.\r\nGordon Cumming, in her \"Fire Fountains of Hawaii,\" speaks of this as\r\n\"filaments of stringy brown lava, like spun glass, which lie scattered\r\nhere and there, having been caught by the wind (when thrown up) in\r\nmid-air in a state of perfect fusion, forming fine lava drops, a rain of\r\nliquid rock, and so drawn out in silky threads like fine silky hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact, this filmy, finely spun glass is known as Pélé's hair--Rauoho o\r\nPélé. It is of a rich olive green or yellowish brown colour--a hint for\r\næsthetic fashions--and is glossy, like the byssus of certain shells, but\r\nvery brittle to handle. Sometimes when the great fire-fountains toss\r\ntheir spray so high that it flies above the level of the cliffs, the\r\nbreeze catches it sportively and carries it far away over the island;\r\nand the birds line their nests with this silky volcanic hair. Sometimes\r\nyou can collect handfuls clinging to the rocks to which it has drifted,\r\ngenerally with a pear-shaped drop attached to it.\" This, it is evident,\r\nwould crumble and break off short in the fingers, and the mineral wool\r\nwhen handled has just the same gritty brittle feeling one can imagine\r\nPélé's hair to have.\r\n\r\nReturning to asbestos, however, its formation or actual origin is at\r\npresent unknown. In its pure state it is as heavy as the rock in which\r\nit is found, so closely are its fine elastic crystalline fibres\r\ncompressed together. These have a beautiful silky lustre, varying in\r\ncolour from pure white to a dusky grey or green, sometimes of a\r\nyellowish green; the direction of the fibres being transverse to the\r\nwalls of the vein. The essential point in which it differs from any\r\nother known mineral consists in its being at once fibrous and textile.\r\nIts quality is determined by the greater or less proportion of silicious\r\nor gritty matter with which its fibres are associated. When crushed out\r\nfrom the rock, these fibres, which vie in delicacy with the finest flax\r\nor the most beautiful silk, can be corded, spun, and woven into cloth in\r\nprecisely the same way as any other textile fibre.\r\n\r\nOf good quality it is only found in serpentine. One instance of its\r\nhaving been found in quartz is mentioned; but, even in that case we are\r\ntold, when six feet of the superficial quartz rock had been blasted\r\naway, the inevitable serpentine was found cropping through.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Ells,[2] the serpentines in which it is found are\r\nintimately associated with masses of dioritic or doloritic rocks, of\r\nwhich rocks certain varieties, rich in olivine or some allied mineral,\r\nthe serpentine is, in many cases, an alteration product. They are\r\nfrequently associated with masses and dykes of whitish rocks, which are\r\noften composed entirely of quartz and felspar, but occasionally with a\r\nmixture of black mica, forming a granitoid rock. They occur generally\r\nnot far from the axes of certain anticlinals which exist in the group of\r\nrocks called by Sir William Logan the \"altered Quebec group.\"\r\n\r\nFor centuries asbestos was regarded merely as a mineral curiosity.\r\nIndeed, it is only within the last few years that it has developed into\r\na valuable article of commerce, the first modern experiments in the use\r\nof it practically extending no farther back than 1850.\r\n\r\nIts uses in the arts and manufactures are of a very important character,\r\nand now that it is clearly demonstrated that a fairly abundant supply\r\ncan be obtained at a moderate cost, there seems no reasonable limit to\r\nbe put to the demand, new uses for it being continually found. These\r\nwill, of course, rapidly increase as its value becomes more clearly and\r\nwidely known.\r\n\r\nIt is found in most parts of the world, but in only a few places of a\r\nsufficiently valuable kind or in quantities large enough to give it any\r\ncommercial value. The main sources of supply at present are Canada and\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nA good deal has, at times, been found in Russia; and I remember an\r\nincident which occurred a few years ago at some extensive ironworks in\r\nthat country, with which I was at the time connected, which amusingly\r\nillustrates how little was then known there of the nature and properties\r\nof the mineral. The iron ore, in the district referred to, is found in\r\nbunches or nodules, near the surface of the ground; and in order to get\r\nit, the peasants dig out pits about seven or eight feet in depth, and\r\nthen burrow, rabbit-like, into the surrounding earth in all directions\r\nbelow. When all the ore is got out from one spot, they dig another pit\r\nfurther afield, and so they go on until the particular patch of ground\r\nthey are working on is exhausted. On the occasion referred to, some of\r\nour men, in their burrowing, threw out a considerable quantity of\r\nasbestos. They had not the slightest idea what it was. In fact, they\r\nknew nothing at all about it, except that it was not what they were in\r\nsearch of; and, consequently, as it obstructed their work, they threw it\r\nall out in a heap near the piles of ore. Presently, one of the foremen\r\nor overlookers saw it, and wanted to know what all that rubbish had been\r\nput there for. \"Here,\" said he, to some of the men, \"just clear up all\r\nthat mess at once, and fling it into the furnace, and get rid of it.\"\r\nAnd this was immediately done, with what result you may imagine.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, it is said that enormous quantities of asbestos have\r\nbeen found in Russia, although I cannot learn that any use is made of it\r\nthere at present. Its mercantile value must of course depend on its\r\nquality and distance from market. I have had a great number of specimens\r\nsent me, but they mostly turn out to be a coarse kind of so-called\r\nbastard asbestos, which would not pay for extracting. Now, however, we\r\nare told that from Orenburg to Ekaterinburg the country is thickly\r\ndotted with asbestos deposits, while near the Verkin Tagil ironworks\r\nthere is a hill called Sholkovaya Gora, or Hill of Silk, which it is\r\nasserted is entirely composed of asbestos. The ore here is also said to\r\nbe of the best white quality, well adapted for all the most important\r\npurposes to which asbestos is applied. I should much like to see a\r\nspecimen of this; its value could be easily determined on inspection. In\r\nthe Gorobtagsdat district of Perm, again, there are said to be large\r\ndeposits cropping out above the surface, and also that enormous\r\nquantities could be had there for nothing, as at this moment it\r\npossesses no value in the Ural region. I imagine it would be found of\r\nconsiderable value if a practical man were sent out to see to its\r\nfiberization on the spot, when it might be compressed, packed, and\r\nexported in the same way as cotton. There can, however, be little doubt\r\nthat if its quality is as good as it is represented to be, it will very\r\nsoon be utilized, and will then form a very important addition to the\r\nvast mineral wealth of that region.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, asbestos is also found in China, but, as a matter\r\nof course, the use to which it is put there is one we should little\r\ndream of here. For instance, in the translation of a Chinese medical\r\nbook by Dr. Hobson, of the London Medical Mission, asbestos is seen to\r\nfigure (of all places in the world) under the head of _tonics_, in\r\ncompany with such heterogeneous substances as \"dried spotted lizard,\r\nsilkworm moth, human milk, parasite of the mulberry tree, asses' glue,\r\nstalactite,\" and a few more surprising things. Perhaps it may be just as\r\nwell for us that we are not yet educated up to so fine a point as that,\r\nand that consequently the mineral we are speaking of does not yet find a\r\nplace in the British Pharmacopoeia, but is left to exhibit its\r\napparently more natural properties in the arts and manufactures.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of _The Financial News_, writing from Barberton in\r\nJanuary, 1888, says that at Komali Fields, fifty miles from that place,\r\nasbestos has just been found, but that it was as yet too soon to discuss\r\nthe merits of the find.\r\n\r\nIn sending you an account of the Canadian asbestos industry, you will\r\nscarcely expect me to give you any very detailed information about its\r\nItalian competitor. Any account of the one, however, would necessarily\r\nbe so incomplete without some mention of the other, that I will do the\r\nbest I can with the little information I have been enabled to obtain on\r\nthe subject of the Italian mines.\r\n\r\nExperiments with the view of utilizing asbestos in Italy appear to have\r\nbeen first successfully carried on in 1850 by the Chevalier Aldini, of\r\nMilan, and others, mainly with the object of turning the mineral to\r\naccount in the manufacture of asbestos cloth. The Chevalier had a\r\ncomplete suit made of it--cap, gloves, tunic, and stockings--for the\r\npurpose of testing its protective powers for firemen; and of this I\r\nshall have something to say presently.[3] But it was not until twenty\r\nyears after this that any success was attained in the manufacture of\r\nasbestos millboard and paper, the commercial value of which is now\r\nassuming such large proportions.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the manufacture of asbestos into packings for piston\r\nglands was successfully accomplished in America; and some two years\r\nafterwards a company, calling itself \"The Patent Asbestos Manufacturing\r\nCompany, Limited,\" was formed in Glasgow for the purpose of making\r\npiston packings according to this American invention. In 1880 this\r\nGlasgow Company united its business with that of Messrs. Furse Brothers\r\nand Co., of Rome, asbestos manufacturers, as well as with that of the\r\nItalo-English Pure Asbestos Company, and, when the amalgamation was\r\ncomplete, the new Company, taking the name of \"The United Asbestos\r\nCompany, Limited,\" became possessed of nearly the whole of the known\r\nItalian mines, and, consequently, of a practical monopoly of the trade\r\nin asbestos from that country.\r\n\r\nItalian differs very materially from Canadian asbestos, not only in\r\nappearance, but in formation also, as well as in the mode of extraction.\r\nThe two are, in fact, entirely separate and distinct kinds of the same\r\nmineral; notwithstanding which their intrinsic qualities are practically\r\nthe same, and the uses to which they are put are almost identical.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary specimen of Italian asbestos, obtained from one of the\r\nmines of the United Asbestos Company, situate in the Valtellina Valley,\r\nis in the possession of that company, and is no doubt the finest piece\r\nof asbestos ever brought from Italy, whether as regards strength or\r\nfineness of fibre. Any one interested in the matter would, I have no\r\ndoubt, be readily permitted to inspect this natural curiosity, on\r\napplication to Mr. Boyd, the courteous manager of the company, in Queen\r\nVictoria Street.\r\n\r\nJust about this time (1880) Canadian asbestos, also, was being much\r\ntalked about and sought after; and it is therefore perhaps scarcely to\r\nbe wondered at that the company which first began to work the mineral in\r\nItaly on a large scale, and which, at great expense and trouble, had\r\nmanaged to secure the whole of the Italian mines, and so become\r\npossessed, as they supposed, of a monopoly of the trade, should have\r\nviewed with jealousy the rapid progress made in public estimation by the\r\nCanadian ore when once it was introduced to the market.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose, however, to enter on the vexed question of the\r\nrelative merits of the two varieties, which would be altogether out of\r\nplace in a letter of this kind. But I think we may safely conclude that\r\nboth possess undeniably good qualities, and that there is an ample field\r\nfor both, inasmuch as the peculiar properties which render one kind\r\nunsuitable for some particular purpose are often precisely those which\r\nbest adapt it for another. Each variety will assuredly make its own way\r\nand take its proper place in public estimation as further experiments\r\nand greater experience in the use of it shall bring its special value\r\nmore prominently to light.\r\n\r\nAmple proof has been given of the valuable qualities of Italian\r\nasbestos; and if any proof were needed of the intrinsic value of its\r\nCanadian competitor, nothing more would be required than to point to\r\nsuch houses as that of John Bell & Son, of London; of Wertheim, of\r\nFrankfort; or to the Johns Manufacturing Company, or the Chalmers-Spence\r\nCompany, of New York, whose world-renowned manufactures are made of\r\nCanadian asbestos alone.\r\n\r\nThe essential characteristics of both sorts are alike in this respect,\r\nthat they are absolutely indestructible by fire, or even when exposed to\r\nthe action of any known acid; the Canadian variety possessing in\r\naddition, in a very high degree, that strange peculiarity (which is also\r\nclaimed for one of the Italian sorts), and is common also to plumbago\r\nand soapstone, of being a self-lubricator. Good Canadian fibre is known\r\nat once by its soft, greasy, soapy feeling; and one of the leading New\r\nYork firms claims for its products, made entirely of Canadian asbestos,\r\nthat they will resist even the flame of the blowpipe; and further\r\nasserts that this mineral transcends all previously thought-of materials\r\nfor fireproofing, in that it is not only absolutely indestructible by\r\nfire, but that its power of resistance cannot be worn away or diminished\r\nby lapse of time or hard usage, as invariably happens in the case of\r\nsuch applications as tungstate of soda.\r\n\r\nRegarding its use, Germany is a very large consumer. In France the\r\nconsumption is not so great, although manufacturers in that country are\r\nnow beginning to bestir themselves, especially in regard to some very\r\nvaluable kinds of paper, which they are making entirely out of Canadian\r\nfibre; and Paris has now set the world an example by the adoption of the\r\nChevalier Aldini's plan of clothing firemen in a dress of asbestos\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nAmerica, however, is the country where the most rapid strides are being\r\nmade in the development of every branch of this new industry, and there\r\nalso the Canadian fibre alone is used.\r\n\r\nA considerable quantity of it is made use of in England, in the\r\nmanufacture of some valuable kinds of packing for engineering work,\r\nmillboards, felts, lubricants, paint, and the like; but in England we\r\nlack in some degree the readiness which is found on the other side of\r\nthe ocean, in the adaptation of new materials and new methods of work.\r\n\r\nWhether it be that Englishmen are influenced by climatic or other\r\ncauses, certain it is that they are slow to adopt new systems, to\r\ncultivate novel ideas, or to move out of old grooves. Consequently, when\r\nnew materials, or even novel applications of those long used, are\r\nsuggested, they ponder over them, hesitate, and weigh the chances, and\r\nin so doing not infrequently let slip valuable opportunities; whilst the\r\nkeener and more enterprising American, once he sees the drift of the new\r\nmatter, will, to use his own expression, \"catch hold\" at once. It by no\r\nmeans follows, however, that this is the fault of the manufacturers\r\nalone; they have naturally to gauge the requirements of their customers,\r\nand prefer to limit their make to what they know they can sell.\r\n\r\nThe finer kinds of asbestos, the strong fibres of which are of a pure\r\nwhite colour and of a fine silky texture, being at the same time free\r\nfrom silicic acid or metallic oxide, are comparatively rare; and, on\r\naccount of their lubricating qualities, are especially valuable. This\r\nparticular kind, I am told, is at the present time only to be found in\r\nCanada and some parts of the States. Whether this statement is correct\r\nor not, I am not in a position to say; but that it is found in Canada I\r\nknow, for I have there personally witnessed the blasting out of many\r\nhundreds of tons. In the Dominion it is invariably obtained from hard\r\nrock somewhat difficult to work.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting paper on Italian asbestos, to be found in the \"Journal\r\nof the Society of Arts\" for April, 1886, to which I have been indebted\r\nfor a good deal of information respecting the Italian mines, I find a\r\nvery singular statement given as the result of long observation by the\r\n_employés_ of the United Company in Italy. It is there said that \"if\r\nasbestos be found on the surface of a rock exposed either to the south\r\nor south-west, the product is generally fairly abundant and of good\r\nquality. If exposed to the east there is fine quality, but very small\r\nquantity; whilst if exposed to the north the quantity is plentiful but\r\ndry and hard, and on entering the rock all traces of it are lost.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this be at all consistent with Canadian experience I cannot say.\r\nThe lie of the ground and the course of the veins being so different, it\r\nis quite possible the theory may have no applicability at all to\r\nCanadian mining. But it is certainly suggestive and interesting, and I\r\nwill cause inquiry in this direction to be set on foot at once.\r\n\r\nIn the same paper I find the following given as analyses of the two\r\nvarieties. The first is stated to be by Professor Barff, but by whom the\r\nlatter was made does not appear. According to these there would be\r\nlittle doubt which was the most valuable for general manufacturing\r\npurposes, but as there is nothing to show what kind of Canadian ore was\r\nsubmitted for analysis, or by whom the analysis was made, you must take\r\nit as an analysis only, _quantum valeat_.\r\n\r\n                                        ITALIAN.

The grey is a long, fibrous variety,\r\npossessing, in addition to strength, the much-prized saponaceous\r\nquality; and this is mostly found in the two Alpine valleys of\r\nValtellina and d'Aosta. The flossy, which has a smooth, silky\r\nappearance, but a dry feeling when touched, is found and worked in part\r\nof the chain of mountains which bound the valley leading from Susa to\r\nTurin, and at an elevation of about 8,000 feet above the sea level. This\r\nis the kind which is mostly used in the manufacture of gas stoves. It is\r\ncommonly found in thicker seams than the grey, lying mostly in a\r\nhorizontal direction, but dipping rapidly as the rock is entered. The\r\nthird is a powdery kind, which, while possessing all the heat-resisting\r\nproperties of the two others, crumbles in the hand when touched. This\r\nvariety is found in the same range of mountains as that last mentioned,\r\nbut at a much lower level; it appears to have been first brought to\r\nlight by a landslip exposing to view a seam of it three feet wide. When\r\nfirst seen it is said to have had a pasty consistency, but on exposure\r\nto the air it dried and crumbled into powder.\r\n\r\nItalian ore, generally speaking, is won by running driftways, or\r\ntunnelling into the face of the rock. In Canada the mineral is got out\r\nby open quarrywork, no tunnelling there being possible. The serpentine\r\nrock in which the asbestos or chrysotile is there found is so split and\r\nseamed in every conceivable direction by the veins and stringers that if\r\ntunnelling were attempted the first blast would inevitably bring the\r\nwhole superincumbent mass down about your ears. You might as well\r\nattempt to tunnel through loose sand or gravel. In other words, the\r\nrelative difference in the two modes of winning the ore appears to be\r\nthat the Italian asbestos may be said to be won by tunnelling into the\r\nface of the rock; whilst the Canadian chrysotile is found in veins,\r\nrunning, it is true, with the greatest irregularity, but yet with a\r\ndistinctly perpendicular declension. The Italian variety, again, seems\r\nfrequently to be found, or the seams to end, in pockets, some of which\r\nhave been known to contain a ton or a ton and a half of asbestos, after\r\nexhaustion of which all appearance of its presence ceased. The Canadian\r\nore, on the other hand, generally runs in veins and seams, which almost\r\ninvariably improve both in quantity and quality the lower you go down,\r\nbut where or how it ends has never yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nIt may possibly be, however, that the more correct way to put this would\r\nbe the very opposite of what I have just stated; because if you stand\r\nand face the rock when laid bare in any of the Canadian mines and trace\r\nthe downward course and increasing strength of the veins, it would\r\nreally seem as if this strange mineral substance, at some former time,\r\nwhen in a state of violent ebullition, had striven energetically to\r\nforce an outlet into the upper air, splitting the overlying rock in all\r\ndirections in its passage upward from below; and that, as it gradually\r\ncooled off and expended its force, the rifts in the rock, which now form\r\nthe veins, became narrower and narrower, until, when the surface of the\r\nground was at last reached it had only just sufficient energy left to\r\nbubble over through the cracks, where it then cooled off and hardened\r\ninto thin lava-like ridges. These ridges are to be seen in all\r\ndirections in the asbestos districts of Canada, wherever the peculiar\r\nyellowish-looking stone forming the upper crust of the asbestos-bearing\r\nrocks is found. And notwithstanding the plainly visible evidence that\r\nthese rocks, from centuries of exposure to the elements, have been worn\r\naway on the upper surface until they have assumed a rounded,\r\nwater-washed, boulder-like shape, the narrow ridges spoken of have\r\napparently always remained in the same state, alike indestructible and\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nIf you will imagine to yourself the mountain masses of almost\r\nperpendicular rock, which contain the horizontally-lying seams\r\nfrequently found in Italy, to be thrown backward and downward so as to\r\nlie face uppermost, and so that you could walk on the face, you will get\r\na rough idea of the lie of the veins in the Canadian serpentine. And\r\npossibly on further exploration the analogy would be still further borne\r\nout by these veins being found to terminate in reservoirs or pockets,\r\njust as it has been said is usually found to be the case in Italy. No\r\none has yet gone far enough down to test the depth of the veins in any\r\nCanadian mine. It will no doubt presently be done. All that would be\r\nrequired would be to bore until the next series was reached. The\r\nexperiment, if expensive, would be both valuable and instructive,\r\nespecially bearing in mind the well-known fact in Canadian mining that\r\nthe deeper you follow the veins into the ground the better the quality\r\nof the cotton becomes.\r\n\r\nThere is one more point of distinction between the two kinds, and that\r\nis in the surface indications, which may possibly be due to atmospheric\r\ninfluences. In Italian exploration the prospector is not guided by any\r\nhard lines or ridges on the rock surface of the ground, as in Canada. On\r\nthe contrary, he finds cracks in the perpendicular face of the rock\r\nfilled with a white powdery substance which, when the surface is broken\r\naway, is said to assume a leathery appearance, after which, when further\r\nentry is made, the true asbestos is found.\r\n\r\nThus, it will be seen that there is not only a considerable difference\r\nbetween the two sorts of asbestos which supply the demands of the\r\nmarket, but that the mode of winning it is also different; as are,\r\nmoreover, the natural indications which guide the explorer in his search\r\nafter the mineral.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] \"Encyl. Brit.\" Art. \"Asbestos.\"\r\n\r\n[2] A member of the Geological Survey Department, Ottawa.\r\n\r\n[3] See _post_, p. 66.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADIAN MINING FOR ASBESTOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now I will leave the subject of the Italian mines altogether, and\r\nproceed to give some account of the asbestos mining industry as carried\r\non in Canada; mainly the result of my notes and observations during a\r\nresidence at the mines.\r\n\r\nThe main sources from which the supply of asbestos in the Dominion is\r\nderived lie in the province of Quebec, in the counties of Megantic and\r\nBeauce. The serpentine rock in which it is found crops up at intervals\r\nall along the belt of what has been previously alluded to as the\r\n\"altered Quebec group\"[4] (pre-Cambrian), throughout a range of over 120\r\nmiles in length, occasionally attaining a width of more than 2,500 feet,\r\nmostly bearing from north-east to south-west, and crossing the Coleraine\r\nDistrict nearly east and west. It extends almost uninterruptedly from\r\nthe boundary of Vermont, in the State of Maine, running north-eastward,\r\nto some distance from the Chaudière River, a little beyond the latitude\r\nof Quebec.\r\n\r\nLarge tracts of serpentine, probably containing the mineral in paying\r\nquantities, occur at Belmina in Wolfe County, and in the vicinity of\r\nBrompton Lake; but although the work of exploration has been carried on\r\nin several places with fair prospects of success, the profitable working\r\nof the mineral up to the present time has been mostly confined to\r\nBroughton, Thetford, Coleraine, and Danville.\r\n\r\nIn the Shickshock mountain region of New Brunswick, said to be a\r\ndetached area of the pre-Cambrian formation, which constitutes the chief\r\nmineral belt of the Eastern Townships (within which the last-mentioned\r\ndistricts are comprised), serpentine and chromic iron are the only two\r\nminerals which have as yet been recognised. Looking, however, to the\r\nfact that these two minerals everywhere accompany the deposits of\r\nchrysotile, as well as the ores of copper, lead, and antimony, with\r\noccasionally richer deposits of gold and silver, in the region to the\r\nsouth-west, it would scarcely seem unreasonable to anticipate\r\ndiscoveries of asbestos in the as yet unexplored region of the Gaspé\r\npeninsula. The range here extends through the northern portion of the\r\npeninsula in rear of Saint-Anne des Monts, and further east on the lower\r\npart of the Dartmouth River.[5]\r\n\r\nIndications of asbestos are found at most points throughout the whole\r\nserpentine formation. The developments, so far as is yet known, are\r\nprincipally, as we have said, in the districts around Thetford and\r\nColeraine. There can, however, be no valid reason why chrysotile of the\r\nricher sorts and in paying quantities should not be found at other\r\npoints, it being only reasonable to suppose that future exploration\r\nwill materially extend the area over which profitable mining operations\r\ncan be carried on.\r\n\r\nIn the Blue Book on the \"Geological Survey of Canada, 1882\" (Mr.\r\nWillimott's report), published by the Dominion Government, it is stated\r\nthat \"there appears to be unlimited quantities of asbestos distributed\r\nthroughout the entire serpentine belt which attains its greatest\r\nprominence in the townships of Thetford and Coleraine. Its existence is\r\ngenerally made apparent by a whitish shining substance found coating the\r\nserpentine, arising from the decay of the outcropping veins. But this,\"\r\nhe says, \"must not be taken as always indicating the presence of\r\nworkable veins.\"\r\n\r\nThe character of the rock varies considerably, and in some places it is\r\neven now apparently in the transition stage between the original rock\r\nfrom which it is derived and a true serpentine, having still almost the\r\nhardness of felspar, while it yet retains the general aspect and colour\r\nof the serpentine in which it is found. Large masses of dioritic rock,\r\nhaving the aspect of dykes, are found in most of the quarries, possibly\r\nrepresenting portions of the original rock not yet altered to\r\nserpentine.[6]\r\n\r\nIt may be taken as a general rule that wherever the true serpentine\r\noccurs asbestos will be found, though it is difficult to say how the\r\nveins have been formed, or how the fact of their existence is to be\r\nknown with any degree of certainty, except by the light superficial\r\nindication already mentioned, which seems at present to be the only, but\r\nby no means infallible, guide. The asbestos traverses the serpentine in\r\nirregular veins ranging from mere threads or stringers to a thickness of\r\nthree or four, and in some cases it is asserted of as much as six\r\ninches; the fibre always, unless affected by the dislocation of the\r\ncontaining rock, lying at right angles to the sides of the fissure.\r\n\r\nThe rock is often impure, the impurity arising mostly from the admixture\r\nof particles, occasionally of small irregular thread-like veins, of\r\nmagnetite or of chromic iron, which break the continuity of the fibre\r\nand cause very careful cobbing of the ore to be necessary in order to\r\nget rid of these impurities. This is particularly the case at Thetford,\r\nas we shall see when speaking of Messrs. King's mine there.[7]\r\n\r\nIn other districts the fibre is discoloured (and the value of it\r\nconsequently much reduced) by the infiltration of water impregnated with\r\nthe oxide of iron. This is especially the case in the Black Lake\r\ndistrict, more particularly on the property of the Anglo-Canadian\r\nCompany, where the serpentine is a good deal shattered by the action of\r\nthe weather, or possibly from other causes. This discoloration ceases as\r\na general rule, or at any rate becomes considerably diminished in\r\nintensity, in proportion as the containing rock becomes more solid. It\r\nis, however, a most serious matter as affecting the character and\r\npecuniary value of these mines.\r\n\r\nIn the case of nearly all the mines there are large quantities of\r\nso-called bastard asbestos found in and about them. This is a woody,\r\nbrittle variety of apparently as yet unformed mineral, for which at\r\npresent no use seems to have been found; but, judging from the course\r\nnew applications of the mineral are now taking, there can be little\r\ndoubt that this inferior article will presently command its price in the\r\nmarket, a use being found for it in some of the many purposes for which\r\ncoarse pulverized asbestos is found to be applicable.\r\n\r\nMany other very singular types are also to be seen. Some of the pieces\r\nas they lie on the ground, after blasting, have so much the appearance\r\nof a wood-cutter's choppings (being, in fact, in the coarse and peculiar\r\ngrain of the fibre, so like chips of wood), that, if placed side by side\r\nwith actual chippings from rough timber exposed to the weather in the\r\nwoods, the one could in no way be distinguished from the other, except\r\nof course by handling, when the weight and stony feeling of the asbestos\r\nwould make the difference at once perceptible.\r\n\r\nChrome iron is frequently found, sometimes as at Thetford and South Ham,\r\nin very large quantities in close proximity to the asbestos-bearing\r\nrock. In the iron, where this is the case, although the stringers of\r\nasbestos may be very minute, they will almost certainly be found\r\nintersecting the ore, just as we have already seen that the grains and\r\nthreads of the chrome iron often cut and spoil the fibre of the\r\nasbestos.\r\n\r\nThe marketable value of asbestos is determined in the first instance by\r\nthe colour, coupled with the thickness or width of the fibre in the\r\nvein. The colour, it may be said, largely depends upon the locality of\r\nthe mine, and will be distinguished at once on inspection of the rocky\r\ngangue. At Thetford it is of a greenish hue, being there found in the\r\ndarker coloured serpentine; whilst at Broughton the ore is of a pearly\r\nyellowish green, the surrounding rock being mostly of a grey or pale\r\ngreen colour. This difference of colour in the ore, however, in no way\r\naffects the value of the mineral, as when crushed out the fibre is\r\nmostly of a uniform whiteness.\r\n\r\nThere are other distinguishing characteristics in the ore even of\r\nclosely adjacent mines, of so marked a nature that an expert has no\r\ndifficulty in determining the locality of the mine, or even of the mine\r\nitself, from the appearance of the ore.\r\n\r\nAlthough scarcely within the scope of the present remarks, it is worthy\r\nof note that serpentines of an ornamental character are very abundant in\r\nCanada; some very beautiful specimens of which were recently shown in\r\nLondon, at the late Colonial and Indian Exhibition at South Kensington.\r\nMany of these contain small quantities of chromium and nickel, and are\r\nassociated with soapstone, potstone, dolomite, and magnetite. A band of\r\nlimestone also occurs at Templeton containing masses of a light-coloured\r\ntranslucent serpentine. These, however, beautiful as they are, do not at\r\nthis moment specially concern us, as none of them contain asbestos in\r\nworkable quantities, the stone being entirely of an ornamental\r\ncharacter. They are exploited with some success by the Canadian Granite\r\nCompany of Ottawa, and are used by them for monuments, mantelpieces,\r\nvases, and such like. One would certainly think that their importation\r\ninto England would meet with success, seeing that there is always a\r\ndemand here for fine marbles and stones for architectural and other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nSir William Logan says: \"Les serpentines, dans toute l'étendue de leur\r\ngisement, fournissent de très-beaux marbres vert-de-mer souvent\r\nressemblant au vert antique.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THETFORD GROUP OF MINES.\r\n\r\nAlthough the existence of asbestos in Canada, in one at least of the\r\nabove-mentioned localities, was known to geologists for many years prior\r\nto 1877, it was not until the autumn of that year that a mine was\r\ndiscovered which proved to be of any commercial importance. This was\r\nfirst found by a farmer, named Fecteau, in the township of Thetford;\r\nand, true to its reputation, Thetford has continued to be the\r\nhead-quarters and main source of the supply ever since.\r\n\r\nThis, the first regular Canadian mine, was opened up in 1878 by Messrs.\r\nJohnson and Ward. The demand at first for the produce of this mine was\r\nexceedingly limited; indeed, great difficulty was experienced in finding\r\na market at all. The output the first year was only about fifty tons;\r\nbut the great value of the mineral being soon ascertained, exploration\r\non the serpentine belt in this neighbourhood was prosecuted on an\r\nextensive scale, which resulted in asbestos being found in workable\r\nquantities over a very considerable area.\r\n\r\nThe mine spoken of is now the property of the Johnson Company, of which\r\nthe Hon. George Irvine, Q.C., is president, and Mr. Andrew Johnson, who\r\nnow represents Megantic in the Provincial Legislative Assembly at\r\nQuebec, is the resident manager. The features of this and the\r\nneighbouring mines are very similar. They consist of a massive\r\nserpentine, varying in colour from a dark green to almost white,\r\nintersected by numerous veins of asbestos of varying thickness,\r\nremarkably free (except in one instance) from any admixture of foreign\r\nsubstances. A large extent of this mine is now opened. It is being\r\nworked with energy and success, its produce being second to none that\r\nhas yet been put on the market. According to a statement given in the\r\nCanadian _Mining Review_ for October last, its output for 1886 was\r\napproximately 375 tons, the total output of the mine up to the end of\r\nthat year being given as 2,500 tons. I was recently informed by the\r\npresident of the company that they had now made a contract for the sale\r\nof the whole of their output for the next five years. The produce of the\r\nmine is nearly all No. 1, and is worth from $80 to $100 a ton.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the Johnson Company's mine is one belonging to the \"Boston\r\nAsbestos Packing Company,\" of which Mr. Hyde Rust, of Boston, is\r\ntreasurer, and Mr. T. Sheridan, local resident manager. This mine is\r\nbeing steadily and efficiently worked, and being practically on the same\r\nlevel with that of the Johnson Company, the produce is of a very similar\r\ncharacter. It is remarkably good, and some exceptionally fine asbestos\r\nhas been got out here. In a pamphlet published a short time ago by the\r\nCanadian Government on the mineral resources of Canada, it is stated\r\nthat the yield from this mine (including of course that last mentioned),\r\nis pronounced by European manufacturers to be the finest and strongest\r\nfibre of the kind known; and it is further stated _that there is no\r\nquestion at all as to the profitable nature of asbestos mining in this\r\nbelt of country_.\r\n\r\nThe output of the Boston Company's mine, according to the authority just\r\ncited, is about 400 tons per annum. Mr. Ells, of the Geological Survey\r\nDepartment, Ottawa, says that in 1886 the quantity extracted was about\r\n700 tons, and the total produce of the mine to the end of that year\r\nabout 3,000 tons. There must, I imagine, be some misapprehension of the\r\nfigures here, and I feel sure that those given above are nearer the\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nThe value of the output of this mine is certainly as high, it is\r\npossible taking it all round, that it may be higher than that of the\r\nlast mentioned. Steps are now being taken to introduce machinery and\r\nprosecute the work on a more extensive scale.\r\n\r\nThe next mine here is one of a more recent date, worked by the Brothers\r\nWard, and owned by them conjointly with the Hon. James Ross of Quebec.\r\nIt is turning out fairly good material, and judging by the indications,\r\ncoupled with what has been already done, there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat this mine will not presently be as remunerative as those already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe output of this, on the same authority, is 150 tons, which is, I\r\nbelieve, the extreme limit of what has yet been done. This mine has been\r\nopened now about four years, and in that time has produced, as near as I\r\ncould learn when last there, about 400 tons. It is said to be worth from\r\n$70 to $80, but I did not hear of any of it fetching more than $70,\r\nwhich is doubtless its present value.\r\n\r\nThe same gentlemen own some very promising-looking land on the other\r\nside of the railway, which, in fact, bisects their property; but as this\r\nis on a lower level it looks very much as if they will be troubled with\r\nwater when they begin to open.\r\n\r\nThe only other mine now opened at Thetford is that owned and worked by\r\nMessrs. King Brothers. It is in the same vicinity and bears much the\r\nsame character as those already mentioned. The output is given at 175\r\ntons per annum.\r\n\r\nThese four mines form the Thetford group, and are at present by far the\r\nmost important in the province. They are on a lower level and are\r\nconsequently worked at a greater depth than those next to be described.\r\nThe output for this reason moreover is of a more uniform character, and\r\ndoes not require such close classification as some of the other mines\r\nfarther on. Practically, No. 1 and No. 3 are the only divisions here,\r\nthe produce being mostly available for No. 1. No. 3 is a very inferior\r\nkind, merely the refuse in fact, which is sold and shipped in bulk at\r\n$10 a ton, without being bagged up at all, and is mostly used for\r\ncement, boiler covering, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Thetford river marks the western limit of the serpentine on these\r\nproperties, the rocks on the other side of the water being mostly\r\naltered slates and sandstones. To the east of the railway, which cuts\r\ndirectly across the area, the serpentine forms a knoll with an elevation\r\nof about 90 or 100 feet above the line of rails; all the workings at\r\npresent being confined to this portion of the area. They consist of open\r\ncuttings on the face of the hill, apparently very little having as yet\r\nbeen done to ascertain the value of the ground between the railway and\r\nthe river. There are certainly good indications there, and when I was\r\nlast at Thetford I found Mr. Ward prospecting in this part with some\r\nsuccess. Here, however, is the place where the water trouble will first\r\narise, which will have to be provided for at the outset.\r\n\r\nThe essential peculiarity of the veins at Thetford is that they are\r\noccasionally associated, as already mentioned, with grains and threads\r\nof chromic iron and also of magnetite. The magnetite forms rather\r\nconspicuous masses between the veins of asbestos in Messrs. King's mine,\r\nwhere it sometimes entirely replaces the latter.[8]\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, however, the surface veins at Thetford are nearly as\r\npure as those lying deeper in the rock, the reason being that the\r\nsurface is mostly naked rock only scantily clothed with vegetable mould,\r\nmoss, or other foreign element, contact with which deteriorates, by\r\ndiscolouring, the fibre, as is found to be the case in a very marked\r\ndegree in the mines next to be described.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiarity of the veins of asbestos that they are never\r\ncontinuous. They vary very much in size, and, in precisely the same way\r\nas other mineral veins, they are affected by faults or slides, which not\r\ninfrequently cut off completely a valuable working face. Where this\r\noccurs the slicken-sided character is very marked.\r\n\r\nSheets, also, of imperfect or immature asbestos, having a long coarse\r\nwoody fibre, are frequently to be seen lying all along the sides of the\r\nfault; but, although there is a good deal of this, the general quality\r\nof the produce of all the Thetford mines is excellent. The fibre is fine\r\nand of a smooth silky texture, very easily worked. The veins are mostly,\r\nespecially in the lower cuttings, more free from impurities than those\r\nof Coleraine.\r\n\r\nNo steam power is at present used in this district, the whole of the\r\nproprietors at present continuing to rely upon hand labour; the Boston\r\nCompany are, however, as just mentioned, now seriously turning their\r\nattention that way, with a view of increasing their output.\r\n\r\nThe Thetford mine-owners are one and all kind and hospitable men, always\r\nready to give every information and to facilitate an inspection of their\r\nworks by anyone who will take the trouble to visit them; a trouble which\r\nI always found very amply repaid by the courtesy with which I was\r\nreceived, and the candour and obliging readiness with which all my\r\ninquiries were immediately answered.\r\n\r\nThe workers in the mines here are mostly resident on the spot,\r\nsufficient accommodation having been provided for them in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the mines; the proprietors, who appear to act with a\r\nliberal consideration towards their men, deeming it incumbent on\r\nthemselves to look after their welfare; and they find their account in\r\nso doing, in not running short of hands at critical times.\r\n\r\nThe practice at Thetford is to close down entirely for the winter\r\nmonths, it not having yet been found advantageous, in view of the\r\nlimited market, coupled with the difficulty of outdoor quarrywork, to\r\nencounter the extra expense of working at this season. Some of the\r\nowners, Messrs. King in especial, being largely interested in the lumber\r\ntrade, to which they devote themselves in the winter, are able to find\r\nplenty of employment at that season for their men and others, who then\r\ngo off into the woods.\r\n\r\nAt Thetford, as elsewhere, great mistakes, arising mainly from\r\ninexperience and want of the knowledge now possessed, were made when the\r\nmines were first opened up, which will inevitably entail serious loss in\r\nthe future; as an instance, much valuable ground is now seen to be\r\ncovered up by the dumps, which will unquestionably have to be moved\r\npresently when the land is wanted for working.\r\n\r\nThe same want of foresight, for which there was less excuse with the\r\nThetford experience to guide them, will inevitably cause trouble in the\r\nnear future at Black Lake, on the property of the Anglo-Canadian\r\nCompany, even to a more serious extent. The parties who first opened up\r\nthe ground here evidently knew what they were about, but their immediate\r\nsuccessors, being destitute of all practical mining knowledge, have, by\r\ntheir neglect of professional assistance, committed such errors of\r\njudgment as will presently occasion very serious expense to the company.\r\nAt their main pit many thousands of tons of waste rock have been dumped\r\non to some of the richest part of the ground, and this must be again\r\nmoved before that ground can be worked. From the peculiarity of the\r\nwork, there probably exists no class of mining which so absolutely\r\nnecessitates the services of a practical mining engineer, in marking out\r\nthe land in the first instance for mining and dumping, as that for\r\nasbestos does.\r\n\r\nThe cost of extraction varies in different localities, depending mainly\r\non the mass of barren rock to be encountered and removed. At Thetford\r\nthe cost may be put at from $20 to $25 per ton, the latter probably\r\nbeing nearer the average. On the Anglo-Canadian Company's property at\r\nBlack Lake it is a more serious matter. There the quantity of barren\r\noverlying rock and earth is enormous, and detracts immensely from the\r\nvalue of the mines. The minimum cost here is $28.\r\n\r\nIn addition to asbestos, it is worthy of note that the whole of the\r\nThetford district is rich in minerals. Among others some large and\r\nvaluable deposits of chromic iron are found in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood, within but a short distance of the asbestos mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLERAINE GROUP.\r\n\r\nFour miles farther down the line of railway from Thetford we come to the\r\nColeraine group of asbestos mines, situate at Black Lake.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer of these mines was a Mr. Noel, now resident at Richmond,\r\nnear Sherbrooke, in the same province, who, in 1881, discovered and\r\nopened up a mine of a promising character here, which in 1882 he sold to\r\nMr. Charles Lionais, who was until recently the resident manager of the\r\nmines owned by the Scottish Asbestos Company, at Black Lake and\r\nBroughton.\r\n\r\nThe mine first opened here was called by Mr. Lionais the \"Eureka,\" and\r\nsome time afterwards he opened another on the same estate which he named\r\nthe \"Emelie.\" The property on which these two mines are located\r\nsubsequently came into the possession of the late Mr. Sénécal, and was\r\nby him transferred to the \"Anglo-Canadian Asbestos Company, Limited,\" on\r\nthe formation of that company in London, in the autumn of 1885.\r\n\r\nThe estate owned by the Anglo-Canadian Company comprises 325 acres, and\r\nhas a frontage of 1,350 feet extending backwards over the hills as far\r\nas Lake Cariboo. Until recently this was the only place in the district\r\nwhere machinery was employed to get out the ore.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar characteristic of this property, as distinguished from the\r\nmines forming the Thetford group, is that much exceedingly heavy work,\r\nnecessitating of course great expense and showing very poor results,\r\nmust of necessity be done before the good veins, if any such exist, as\r\nit is believed they do, are reached. Much of this has already so far\r\nbeen done at the Emelie, that at length this portion of the property\r\nbids fair, in capable hands, of proving to be a moderately paying mine.\r\nGreat results were prophesied from it at first, but so far it has by no\r\nmeans realised expectations.\r\n\r\nThe surface veins, not only at the \"Emelie\" but all over the property so\r\nfar as yet proved, are not only thin, but are much discoloured by the\r\ninfiltration of water which is so strongly impregnated with the oxide of\r\niron as almost to destroy its value. It was thought, and as it would\r\nappear with some show of reason, that the output would greatly improve\r\nin value as a lower depth was reached; but although there has\r\nundoubtedly been a sensible improvement in quality, the general result\r\nis disappointing. Started as a No. 3 mine, as such in all probability it\r\nwill continue. The output from this Company's mines for 1886 was 330\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nThe No. 3 quality of asbestos, which has hitherto been the main produce\r\nof this mine, fetches so low a price in the market that alone it would\r\nnot pay for working. This, as already explained, is mainly on account of\r\nits bad colour and general coarse quality. This latter having somewhat\r\nimproved, a considerable proportion of the produce would cease to be\r\nclassed as No. 3 if it were not for the bad colour. It therefore\r\noccurred to me that it might be possible to remove this defect without\r\ninjuring the fibre, and in consequence I had some experiments made with\r\nthis object in view, and ultimately succeeded beyond my expectations, in\r\nreplacing the discoloured fibre by one sufficiently bright to enable it\r\nto take rank as No. 1. These experiments, it is true, were only\r\nconducted on a limited scale, but, so far as I am aware, there is no\r\nreason why it should not be done on a large scale, which would very\r\nmaterially increase the value of the article.\r\n\r\nThere is ample room for opening up in a more judicious way on other\r\nparts of this property on what seems likely to be good paying ground;\r\nand a mode of doing this without incurring any further expense might\r\neasily be devised, and, if this were done, other seams of better quality\r\nmight be hit upon.\r\n\r\nAnother point in the company's favour is that, if judiciously selected,\r\nthere is abundant room for dumping without encroaching on the\r\nore-bearing grounds--a most important matter when consideration is taken\r\nof the enormous quantity of waste rock to be here encountered and\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe buildings on the estate are well constructed, and are in an\r\nefficient state of repair, but at present there is an insufficiency of\r\ndwelling-houses on the property. These are a necessity in the district,\r\nfor securing and retaining a better class of labour. No great expense\r\nwould have to be incurred in supplying this deficiency. Lumber and\r\nlabour are both comparatively cheap, and the buildings in themselves,\r\nmoreover, would always return a fair interest on the outlay.\r\n\r\nThe property on which the \"Martin\" Mine is located closely adjoins the\r\nlast mentioned. This has recently been acquired by \"The Scottish\r\nAsbestos Company,\" of Glasgow, with the intention of working it in\r\nconjunction with their mines at East Broughton. Judging by the elaborate\r\npreparations for work which are being made, and the expenditure which is\r\nbeing incurred in buildings and machinery, it is evidently the company's\r\nintention to carry on work vigorously in both places.\r\n\r\nTheir property at Black Lake covers 102 acres, and is described as being\r\na mile long by 520 feet wide. The output is given as 300 tons, but I\r\nshould doubt very much if it has yet reached this figure.\r\n\r\nThe ground here and in front of the Anglo-Canadian Company's land rises\r\nvery rapidly, from the level of the Quebec Central Railway, until it\r\nattains a height of nearly 600 feet, being then about on a level with\r\nthe Thetford mines. The great serpentine belt crosses both properties,\r\nand is bounded along its northern margin by quartzose granulite,\r\nseparated from the serpentine by a narrow belt of soapstone. It is\r\nclaimed for property of the Scottish Asbestos Company, that not less\r\nthan three-quarters of it consists of the rock formation that seems to\r\nbe the asbestos matrix.\r\n\r\nThis property is well laid out, and has a considerable number of\r\ndwellings already erected on it for the workpeople. It is also traversed\r\nby a good road leading down to the line of railway.\r\n\r\nOn a narrow strip of land, dividing the properties of the last two\r\nmentioned companies, is a small mine called the Frechette-Douville Mine,\r\nwhich (working the same seams of ore), was doing very well when I was\r\nthere. The output of this is not large, but the quality was very good,\r\nand this in consequence is no doubt a very paying mine.\r\n\r\nThese are the only mines at present being worked at Black Lake, but from\r\nindications on other properties lying on the same line, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that other mines will presently be opened up in this\r\nlocality. Capital is all that is wanting at present, but, as the demand\r\nfor the mineral increases, the necessary capital for producing it in\r\nlarger quantities will no doubt be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe companies working at Black Lake when I was last there were working\r\nat a great disadvantage as compared with those at Thetford, in the want\r\nof a station on the line. The Post Office arrangements were also of a\r\nvery primitive character, nor was there any wire nearer than Thetford.\r\nAll this, however, has been remedied, and there is now at Black Lake not\r\nonly a station but also a post and telegraph office, in addition to many\r\nnew houses for the accommodation of the workpeople.\r\n\r\nThe cost of mining, for the reasons already given, is, and must of\r\nnecessity be, greater at Black Lake than at Thetford, and cannot be put\r\nat less than $28 a ton. After removal of the surface earth and rock, the\r\nproportion of refuse rock is about twenty-five tons to one of asbestos.\r\n\r\nIn regard to communication, Black Lake is 80 miles from Quebec, and\r\nabout 60 from Sherbrooke; the latter being a rising place, where all\r\nstores, &c., needed for the mines are obtainable and from whence lines\r\nradiate to all parts of the States.\r\n\r\nThere are several other places in the vicinity of Black Lake where,\r\nalthough all that has yet been done may be called simple exploratory\r\nwork, the indications are such as to warrant the expectation that\r\nvaluable results may be looked for. This is especially the case in what\r\nare known as the Reed and Haydon properties which extend over about 200\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nOn Dr. Reed's land, or rather on that part of it known as the \"Coleraine\r\nMines,\" which is about 100 acres in extent, the ground has already been\r\nopened up in ten different places, each of which shows good No. 1\r\nasbestos in quantities sufficient for profitable working.\r\n\r\nThe outcroppings here, moreover, are far superior to anything that can\r\nbe seen on the ground lower down where work is now being carried on. A\r\npractical mining engineer who was recently sent to examine and report on\r\nthis property says that it is 100 per cent. better than that at Black\r\nLake; that 75 per cent. of the whole is veritable asbestos-bearing land,\r\nand that he knows of no other asbestos mine so well situate for\r\npractical work, or showing such advantages in timber, water, and,\r\ndumping ground. The timber is sufficient for all practical purposes for\r\nat least twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Ells, in his Annual Report to the Minister of the Interior, for\r\n1886, speaking of his visit to the asbestos district and of his\r\ninspection of these properties, makes special mention of them as\r\nfollows: \"In the vicinity of Black Lake several other areas occur, in\r\nwhich the exploratory work done, though not very extensive, shows\r\nindications that _fully warrant_ the statement that a valuable and\r\nprofitable output may be expected. These properties are known as the\r\nReed and Hayden properties, and are situated on lots 27 and 28, Range B\r\nof Coleraine. In various open cuts in the side of the hills numerous\r\nveins are disclosed, ranging upwards to a width of two and a half\r\ninches, with surface indications apparently in no way inferior to those\r\nof the adjoining properties now being worked at this place, _or even of\r\nthose of Thetford mines_, not only as to the _number_ and _size_ of the\r\nveins, but also as to the _quality_ of the fibre. These indications\r\nappear at many points on both the Hayden and Reed properties, which\r\nembrace a total of 200 acres.\"\r\n\r\nBetween these properties and Cariboo Lake the serpentines extend in an\r\napparently continuous ridge, and show, at intervals, very good\r\nindications of asbestos. This area, however, has not yet been\r\nsufficiently explored for much to be said, from actual observation, of\r\nits value as asbestos land, though it seems reasonable enough to suppose\r\nthat this portion of the serpentine belt will be presently found equally\r\nvaluable with that of the adjoining section.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the Coleraine Station of the Quebec Central Railway\r\n(the next station to Black Lake), serpentine also occurs; but the main\r\nridge, extending south-west, keeps to the north-west for about a mile\r\nand a half, where it forms a conspicuous hill feature. An opening\r\nrecently made on this south-west extremity by Mr. Kennedy disclosed the\r\npresence of a number of asbestos veins, one of which, occurring near the\r\nsurface had a width, it is said, of nearly four inches. Sufficient work\r\nhas not yet been done to determine the persistence and value of these\r\nveins, though when I was last leaving the district I was given to\r\nunderstand that energetic operations would commence immediately on the\r\nopening of the working season.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity here is the occurrence of a considerable quantity of mica\r\nin direct contact with the asbestos, a circumstance which has not\r\nhitherto been found to be the case anywhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROUGHTON.\r\n\r\nThe finest vein of asbestos ever yet worked in Canada was discovered at\r\nBroughton, when the Fraser Mine was first opened and worked by Dr. Reed;\r\nalthough doubtless the largest, most continuous, and consequently best\r\npaying veins have been found at Thetford, some of which, it has been\r\nstated, were over six inches in thickness. I confess I have not been\r\nfortunate enough to see anything like this, but I have seen many veins\r\nthere, the produce of which was of surprising beauty, and specimens of\r\nwhich I have before me as I write, which are broad enough and good\r\nenough for any purpose to which the fibre can possibly be put.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be borne in mind that the same rule obtains with many\r\nother things as is noted in the vegetable world--namely, that the\r\nlargest specimens are not necessarily the best. The broader veins of\r\nasbestos do not, as I have already remarked, yield as a rule fibre of so\r\nfine a quality as those of a medium, or even of a small size. The length\r\nof the fibre, moreover, cannot be determined with any absolute certainty\r\nfrom the thickness of the vein. On the contrary, the broader veins are\r\nnot seldom found to be separated at right angles to the length of fibre\r\nby minute bands of serpentine, chrome, or magnetite, sometimes even by a\r\nseparation without any perceptible layer of rock, the only indication of\r\nthis being an irregular, scarcely visible line, readily detected by the\r\nexpert.[9]\r\n\r\nUnder the hammer the big veins, in which the separation exists, are at\r\nonce divided into two, or it may be into three lengths of fibre; but if\r\nthe cotton be pure and clear, this is no very great detriment. Veins of\r\nan inch or an inch and a half extracted from compact rock seldom have\r\nthese intersections. The veins, moreover, are extremely irregular in\r\ncharacter, a small vein at the surface frequently developing into one of\r\nconsiderable size lower down, or breaking off altogether. This is the\r\nspecial characteristic of the veins in the Coleraine district--notably\r\nat Black Lake--at the mines of the Anglo-Canadian Company, and at\r\nDanville. At Thetford, on the other hand, where the ground is of a more\r\nuniform character, and at a lower level than at Black Lake, fine veins\r\nare frequently met with just below the surface, which continue for a\r\nconsiderable distance with very little change.\r\n\r\nIt will clearly be seen, therefore, that it is not possible properly to\r\nappreciate the value of such a mine as this without inspection and\r\nthorough examination by an expert. Fine specimens can at any time be\r\nobtained, and have before now been exhibited at a distance as being the\r\nproduce of some particular mine for which a purchaser was wanted, when\r\nanyone visiting the spot would at once see the utter impossibility of\r\nsuch having been the case; and even if it were proved to be true that\r\nthe specimens exhibited came from the place indicated, it would be\r\nimportant to know at what depth they were got, with the nature and\r\ngeneral disposition of the mine, as well as the proportion of\r\nsuperincumbent rock requiring to be removed before the valuable veins\r\ncould be worked. Without a knowledge of this it is self-evident that no\r\npractical estimate of expense to be incurred could possibly be made.\r\n\r\nThe discovery at Broughton made a great stir at the time; but the big\r\nvein there was to all appearance soon worked out, the supply thought to\r\nbe exhausted, and work in consequence discontinued.\r\n\r\nThat, at any rate, was the view taken by the gentleman who then worked\r\nthe mine. About 130 tons, I was told, were got out, which fetched from\r\n$100 to $120 a ton. It would now be worth a much better price.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Asbestos Company have since then purchased this property,\r\nand from the extensive preparations they are making for work, and the\r\ngreat outlay they are incurring for machinery, buildings, and plant, it\r\nis clear that they do not by any means coincide in the view above\r\nexpressed. The stratification at Broughton is peculiar, and different\r\nfrom anything that is found either in Thetford or Coleraine. It is\r\nquite possible, therefore, that the Company's advisers may be right, and\r\nthat the surface deposits will be found to continue in richness and\r\nvolume lower down. The developments at present consist of an open cut 15\r\nto 20 feet deep by 8 feet wide following the vein and the serpentine\r\nreef is laid open for a length of about 900 feet.\r\n\r\nWhen I last visited Broughton, in the autumn of 1886, I went over the\r\nground in company with the late Mr. Fraser, who was then resident on the\r\nproperty, but was unable, from the quantity of water in the cut, to\r\ntrace any of the big veins which had previously been worked. It was\r\nevident, however, that in consequence of a sudden dip downwards\r\nconsiderable expense would have to be incurred, and much very heavy work\r\ndone, before the seam could be reached again. The belt of serpentine\r\nhere is very narrow, and the veins of asbestos are closely pressed\r\ntogether. The strike is east and west, and the dip 30°.\r\n\r\nThere are prospects here to the north-east, apparently of as valuable a\r\ncharacter as those of the mine already opened. A few days after my\r\nvisit, I was shown some fine samples from the surface work of this\r\nplace, where the ground had just been stripped, and these bore the\r\nprecise characteristics of the fine vein already spoken of. The\r\nBroughton ore has a pale yellowish hue, as distinguished from the\r\ngreenish metallic lustre which distinguishes the finer samples from\r\nThetford. This does not, it must be observed, in any way deteriorate or\r\ninjuriously affect the clear whiteness of the fibre when crushed out,\r\nalthough it at once identifies the locality of its production. There\r\nare, in fact, as I have already mentioned, certain peculiarities, even\r\nof colour, attaching to the ore of each locality of so marked a\r\ncharacter that an expert can at once tell, on inspection, from what\r\nlocality it was obtained.\r\n\r\nThere is great abundance of soapstone (steatite) at Broughton; much of\r\nit of good quality, and some of it is remarkably pure. I brought away a\r\nsingular specimen, having all the grain and even the fibrous markings of\r\nasbestos, which was nevertheless pure and unmistakable unfibred\r\nsteatite.\r\n\r\nAt present no use is being made of this material at Broughton, but at\r\nWolfestown, in the same province, there is a manufactory for its use,\r\nand here slabs of very fine quality can be procured. A workable bed of\r\nvery superior quality has been found also at Potton, and there is\r\nanother at South Ham, near the antimony mines on the Lake Nicolet\r\nestate. Reduced to powder, the softness and unctuosity of steatite have\r\ncaused it to be used, in the same manner as plumbago, for lubricating\r\npurposes, and when finely ground it is employed for giving a surface to\r\nsome kinds of paperhangings.\r\n\r\nThe substance called Venetian or French chalk, used by tailors and\r\nothers, is nothing more than steatite. It can be readily cut with a\r\nknife, and is infusible in any ordinary furnace heat.\r\n\r\nSlaty varieties, of which there are many, are comparatively useless.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANVILLE.\r\n\r\nThere is a mine at Shipton, about four miles from the village of\r\nDanville, contiguous to the line of the Grand Trunk Railway, which has\r\nbeen for some time worked by Mr. Jeffery, whose acquaintance I had the\r\npleasure of making in Montreal, but I much regret that time did not\r\npermit of a visit to this mine, so I can give no details of my own\r\npersonal knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe outcrop of the serpentine here, I am told, is quite limited, with\r\nsteep sides till round it. It however contains numerous veins of\r\nasbestos which, though mostly of small size, are of good quality. Faults\r\nare numerous, and these considerably affect the value of the property,\r\nsome of the good veins, with a thickness of two inches, for instance,\r\nbeing cut off completely at a distance of fifty feet from the surface.\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet published at Ottawa, by the Department of Agriculture of\r\nthe Dominion Government, I find it stated that the whole output of this\r\nmine has been contracted for the next ten years. This is said to\r\namount to 100 tons per annum, and its value is given as $60 per ton.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH HAM.\r\n\r\nThis mine, the property of Dr. Reed of Reedsdale, Megantic, is situate\r\non the Nicolet Estate, in the township of South Ham, 7-½ miles from\r\nthe Garthby Station on the line of the Quebec Central Railway. It was\r\nfirst described as being situate on Big Island, in the centre of Lake\r\nNicolet, where the serpentine rocks rise very abruptly to the height of\r\nseventy feet, forming precipitous cliffs on the western side of the\r\nisland. Recent exploration, however, has shown that the main body of\r\nasbestos is on the hill-side, and is of such extent as altogether to\r\neclipse that proved to exist on the island, which was at first thought\r\nto be the chief source of supply.\r\n\r\nThe mine on the island is not being worked, but has been fully proved by\r\nnumerous openings which have been made at the most promising points,\r\nrevealing in every case veins of asbestos of remarkably good quality and\r\nin great abundance. These, as mentioned, are now known to pass under\r\nthe lake, and can be seen cropping out in many places on the shore and\r\nthe hill-side.\r\n\r\nThe mineral as seen on the island presents many points of difference\r\nfrom that at Thetford and Coleraine; and in the Geological Survey of\r\nCanada, I find it is stated to consist of four varieties, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1st. Small veins, rarely exceeding half an inch in width, the fibres not\r\neasily separable. This, however, does not detract from its commercial\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n2nd. Apparently occupying a position at right angles to the veins above\r\nnoticed, is a coarse fibrous mineral, resembling rope, and evidently\r\nderived from the associated picrolite. The extreme length which these\r\nfibres may attain could not be determined, but judging from exposed\r\nportions, it cannot be less than three feet.\r\n\r\n3rd. Veins somewhat resembling the latter in aspect, but much finer in\r\ntexture. The fibre can be separated with great facility, though firmly\r\nattached at one end to the parent rock.\r\n\r\n4th. A steatitic asbestos rock, resembling \"Mountain leather,\" forming\r\nimportant masses, which enclose small concretionary pellets of asbestos,\r\nthe centres of which contain a nucleus of serpentine.\r\n\r\nVery little (the report says) has yet been done on the island to develop\r\nthese asbestos veins, perhaps owing to the difficulty of transport\r\nacross the lake. This, however, would probably be more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the magnificent returns which this locality promises\r\nto afford.\r\n\r\nDr. Reed at present is altogether neglecting the asbestos and devoting\r\nhis attention to the development of a very promising antimony mine on\r\nthe shore of the lake.\r\n\r\nIndeed this estate might very justly be termed a typical Canadian\r\nmineral estate, and is, in its way, unique, for comprised within its\r\n2,000 acres, there are found to exist not only rich veins of antimony\r\nand asbestos, and, as was stated in the notice of Broughton, enormous\r\nquantities of soapstone, but there are also immense deposits of iron,\r\nmagnetic, chromic, and bog ore, as well as copper and sulphur. Silver to\r\nthe value of $4 per ton of ore is found with the antimony, and reefs of\r\nauriferous quartz run through the entire property, from which a\r\npractical miner from Australia, who was examined before the committee\r\nappointed in 1887 by the Dominion Government to investigate the\r\ngold-fields of Canada, stated that he had taken samples which on assay\r\ngave 2-½ ozs. gold to the ton. Nickel also is found on the property,\r\nand cobalt.\r\n\r\nEverything necessary for the working of those valuable deposits\r\nalready exists on the ground--unlimited water supply, and timber for\r\nbuilding and mining purposes, as well as for charcoal for any furnaces\r\nthat may presently be erected: sufficient, if judiciously managed\r\naccording to the rules of forestry such as obtain in Germany, Austria,\r\nand Russia, to last until a new growth matures. In regard to transport,\r\nthe roads are good, and a line of rail connecting the Grand Trunk with\r\nthe Intercolonial will touch the property next summer, and will, it is\r\nexpected, have a station there just below the antimony mine. In regard\r\nto steatite, the quantity here is so enormous that an expert (Captain\r\nA. M. Evans, of the firm of Blakemore and Evans, the well-known civil\r\nand mining engineers of Cardiff), who was lately sent by me to report\r\non this property, speaking of steatite, says, \"All I can say is, there\r\nare mountains of it.\"\r\n\r\nThis mineral is a more or less pure and compact talc. When pure and of\r\nclose hard grain it is used as a refractory for lining furnaces,\r\nespecially those designed for anthracite. It is in demand also for gas\r\nburners, not being liable to rust or corrosion, and also for the\r\nconstruction of small portable furnaces and open stoves. It is used also\r\nin the manufacture of paints. When very strongly heated, steatite loses\r\nthe small portion of combined water contained in it, and then in\r\nconsequence becomes much harder.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOLFESTOWN.\r\n\r\nThe description of the asbestos area of Wolfestown is given by Mr. Ells.\r\nIt is situate on the north-east extremity of a serpentine ridge which\r\nextends south-westerly, with many interruptions, from the road leading\r\nfrom Coleraine Station to Wolfestown, in the vicinity of Lake Nicolet.\r\nIt belongs to Mr. John Bell (John Bell & Co., asbestos manufacturers,\r\nLondon), and considerable sums have been expended on the property in the\r\nway of exploration. The surface indications are said not to be equal to\r\nthose at Black Lake, but show at several points numbers of veins, some\r\nof which are from one and a half to two inches thick.\r\n\r\nA very fair showing of workable veins has been exposed on the upper part\r\nof a deep cut, which it is proposed to intersect at a considerably lower\r\nlevel. Should the same rule of increase which holds good at Thetford and\r\nColeraine obtain here, there should be good paying ground exposed when\r\nthe lower level is driven in past the cap of barren rock, provided the\r\nveins already disclosed are not cut off by faults, whose presence is\r\nnoted here as at other points.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of asbestos taken from the Belmina district Mr. Ells\r\nputs at about twenty-five tons.\r\n\r\nConsiderable quantities of chromic iron are found on the hills in this\r\narea, which embraces about six hundred acres.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are all the Canadian mines now in work, as far as I have\r\nbeen able to learn, certainly all of any importance. There can be no\r\ndoubt, however, that as the demand increases further explorations will\r\nbe made, and new mines discovered, as well as that increased capital\r\nwill be put in to further develop those already at work. At the present\r\ntime the supply scarcely keeps pace with the demand, and capitalists are\r\nbeginning to wake up to the importance of this industry; _it having been\r\nnow conclusively proved that mining for asbestos, properly conducted,\r\nshows a more steady return for the money invested, with less elements of\r\nrisk, than mining for any other known mineral_.\r\n\r\nI am unable to say, with any degree of exactness, what is the amount of\r\nthe aggregate output of the Canadian mines; but I saw it stated in a\r\nlocal paper that, in 1885, it was under 1,500 tons, and that in 1886 it\r\nhad reached 2,000 tons, giving an increase of over 500 tons for the\r\nyear. This is quite sufficient to show the rapid strides the business is\r\nmaking, and is probably near about correct, judging by the rate of\r\nprogression in the imports to the States, for instance. The value of\r\nmanufactured asbestos imported into the United States from Canada, in\r\n1880, is given in the Government Returns as under 10,000 dollars. In\r\n1884 it had risen to 48,755 dollars, and it has been increasing yearly\r\never since. That the demand is rapidly increasing is unquestionable, not\r\nonly for the present articles of manufacture, but for the new purposes\r\nto which it is being daily applied. More capital will, doubtless, soon\r\nbe put in, and then new lines, which almost indicate themselves, will\r\nprepare the way for continued success.\r\n\r\nAs regards the progressive output of crude asbestos at the mines, since\r\nits introduction in 1887, the following may no doubt be taken as\r\nauthentic, being extracted from the \"Statistical Report on the\r\nProduction, Value, Exports, and Imports of Minerals in Canada during the\r\nyear 1886 and previous years,\" by Eugène Coste, M.E., published by\r\nauthority of the Dominion Parliament. In this Report the production and\r\nvalue is given as follows:--\r\n\r\n                       Value at the Mines.\r\n             Tons.          Dollars.\r\n  1879        300            19,500\r\n  1880        380            24,700\r\n  1881        540            35,100\r\n  1882        810            52,650\r\n  1883        955            68,750\r\n  1884      1,141            75,079\r\n  1885      2,440           142,441\r\n  1886      3,458           206,251\r\n\r\nThe mode of extraction in all Canadian asbestos mines is by open quarry\r\nwork. Whether the drills are worked by compressed air, or by hand in the\r\nold-fashioned way, the effect is the same. When a sufficient number of\r\nholes of the proper depth are drilled and duly charged with dynamite or\r\npowder, they are linked together, and fired by a battery in such a way\r\nthat the face of rock shall be thrown outward on to the floor of the\r\npit. The asbestos is then picked out, the adhering rock roughly broken\r\noff, and the ore piled into boxes or tubs, which are loaded on to\r\ntrolleys, and run off on tram-lines to the cobbing-sheds. The refuse\r\nrock, of which there is always an enormous quantity (probably as much as\r\ntwenty tons of rock to one ton of asbestos), is loaded into cars, run\r\noff and shot over on to the dumping-ground.\r\n\r\nBoys are employed in the cobbing-sheds to chip, or cob, the rock cleanly\r\nfrom the ore, an operation which is much more troublesome with thin\r\nveins than with those of the better sort to which, as I have already\r\nsaid, the waste rock is less firmly adherent. This cobbing is a very\r\ntroublesome and expensive process, costing about 5 dollars a ton. After\r\ncobbing, great care is required in sorting the ore into the respective\r\ngrades of Nos. 1, 2, and 3. It is then put up in bags of about 160 lbs.\r\neach, marked, and stacked away in the bins ready for shipment. All this\r\nis done in a very rough and ready style, and the waste is simply\r\nenormous: there is no doubt, however, that as the ore increases in value\r\nmore scientific appliances will be adopted with good results. At present\r\nthousands of tons of rock containing only thin veins of asbestos are\r\ndumped on the refuse heaps as waste which would all be crushed if a\r\nproper machine were at hand, and the valuable material saved.\r\n\r\nIn the cobbed state ready for market the ore is worth at the mines at\r\nthe present time from 50 dollars to 55 dollars for No. 2, and from 80\r\ndollars to 100 dollars for No. 1. It is evident, therefore, on a\r\ncomparison of the cost of extraction with the price realised for the raw\r\nmaterial, that there is ample margin for good profit.\r\n\r\nWages run from 1 dollar to 1 dollar 75 cents a day, according to the\r\nnature of the work performed, for men, and from 50 cents to 1 dollar for\r\nlads and cobbers. The comparison of the cost of production, therefore,\r\nwith the value of the raw material, shows a very large margin of profit.\r\n\r\nThere is no scarcity of labour, a sufficient number of hands, mostly\r\nFrench-Canadians, being always forthcoming; but at those mines where\r\nthere is an insufficiency of houses for married men, accommodation has\r\nto be found in the barrack-like building for single men; the married\r\nmen, who cannot be accommodated, residing frequently at a long distance\r\nfrom their work, which causes them to be of a migratory disposition, and\r\ngives considerable additional trouble to the management.\r\n\r\nA disadvantage in the employment of French-Canadian labour lies in the\r\ngreat number of festivals incident to their religion, with consequent\r\nloss of work at the mines, but apparently there is no remedy for this at\r\npresent. The greatest curse of the place, however, is gin. Although the\r\ndistrict is under the Scott Act, and the sale of liquor consequently\r\nprohibited, like every other place where the sale is interdicted there\r\nis no difficulty, if you know how to go about it, sometimes even if you\r\ndon't, in getting as much as you please. At any rate I never yet was in\r\nany such place where I did not find it to be so.\r\n\r\nHere is an instance: On one occasion I had been out driving in the\r\npouring rain for several hours, had got drenched to the skin, and was\r\nbitterly cold. I pulled up, therefore, at a likely-looking house, went\r\nin and called for some brandy, but to my disgust was told no liquors\r\ncould be supplied, as it was against the law. As I turned to go out\r\nagain, in no very cheerful mood, the man, seeing the state I was in,\r\nevidently took compassion on me, and said, \"Better try some bitters;\" so\r\ncalling to mind the old saying that all bitters are warm barring a\r\nbitter cold day, which only proves the rule, I assented. He then pushed\r\nover a tumbler and a black bottle, when I at once poured out and\r\nswallowed a pretty strong dose, feeling when I had done so as if I had\r\nswallowed a streak of forked lightning. As soon as I had recovered my\r\nbreath I muttered my thanks and paid up. \"Have another?\" says he, with a\r\ntwinkle in his eye. \"No, thanks;\" I replied. \"Guess you'll remember our\r\nbitters,\" he then laughingly said, prefixing the name of the place,\r\nwhich I afterwards found was in a district where prohibition was very\r\nstrictly enforced, and which I therefore purposely omit, his breach of\r\nthe law having no doubt saved me from the dangerous effects of a chill.\r\n\r\nThe hip pockets in the men's pants form very convenient receptacles for\r\nthe bottles, and are always pretty well filled after pay days and\r\nholidays. The liquor most in favour is a vile compound called gin. It is\r\nsupplied in the regular square Dutch bottles from the familiar\r\ngreen-painted boxes in which \"Hollands\" is exported, and which are\r\nlabelled \"De Kuyper;\" but the vile stuff is not much credit to that\r\ngentleman's manufacture if it be so, which is much to be doubted.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] _Ante_, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[5] \"Geol. Hist. Can.,\" 1880.\r\n\r\n[6] See _ante_, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[7] See _post_, p 33.\r\n\r\n[8] \"Geographical Survey of Canada.\"\r\n\r\n[9] _Ante_, p. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES TO WHICH ASBESTOS IS APPLIED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to the many varied uses to which this mineral is now put,\r\nforemost must be placed the numerous valuable articles manufactured for\r\nengineering purposes.\r\n\r\nWere I to attempt to enumerate the various kinds of packing, mostly in\r\nthe shape of millboard, in use for all kinds of engines, for steam\r\njoints, cylinder and steam chest covers, pipe flanges, &c., this part of\r\nmy little book would have the appearance of a manufacturer's catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly increasing favour with which high pressure steam is now\r\nregarded by engineers, recently necessitated the introduction of a\r\npacking capable of resisting the higher temperatures and pressures; as a\r\nconsequence manufacturers of asbestos goods had to devise improved\r\nmethods of manufacture in order to meet the new condition of things, and\r\nthis they succeeded in doing in a way to give universal satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFor washers asbestos has many advantages over rubber; its weight is\r\nless, they can be frequently used, and half the thickness of rubber is\r\nmostly sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe fibre, Sir Frederick Abel says, is as effectual for closing the\r\nbreeches of big guns so as to prevent the passage of gas, as for\r\nensuring safety, in the same way, for miners' lamps. In these last, it\r\nhad for a long time been found very difficult to get a good joint\r\nbetween the metallic and the glass parts of the safety lamp, and a great\r\nmany different materials were tried for filling these joints in such a\r\nway that air should not be able to pass through. In many cases, the air\r\nwas contaminated with a certain amount of gaseous material which would\r\nbe likely to render the whole explosive, and if this got through the\r\njoint between the glass and the metal, there would be very serious risk\r\nof explosion. After a great number of substances had been tried and\r\nfound unsatisfactory, some hundreds of experiments were made by Sir\r\nFrederick Abel and Sir Warington Smyth, with asbestos washers, which, in\r\nthe end, were found to maintain their condition most admirably.\r\n\r\nWith regard to closing the breeches of big guns, we are informed also on\r\nthe authority of Sir Frederick Abel, that the only contrivance which\r\ncould be called an approach to a perfect arrangement, was one devised by\r\na French artillery officer, M. Dubange, which consisted of a kind of pad\r\nof asbestos fibre attached to the breech-closing arrangement. This, from\r\nits mineral nature, was nearly indestructible, and, consequently, lasted\r\nwithout material deterioration for a great length of time,\r\nnotwithstanding that it was subjected to the enormous pressures which\r\nare now developed in the bores of very heavy guns.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Whitehead torpedoes, we learn from the same\r\nauthority, that in these and other similar receptacles, within which\r\ncharges of wet gun cotton are enclosed, the use of asbestos is now found\r\nto overcome a great difficulty. The vessels containing the damp cotton\r\nhave to be soldered, in order to keep them perfectly air-tight, and\r\nthus prevent the water from escaping; and in order to do this, with\r\nanything approaching safety, the space between the gun cotton and the\r\nmetal surfaces which have to be soldered, were formerly filled with damp\r\nfelt wads or discs. This answered the purpose; but Sir Frederick Abel\r\nstates that it was found after they had been stored for some time, that\r\nthe effect of the moisture on the felt was to cause it to undergo a kind\r\nof decay or fermentation, resulting in the formation of gas to such an\r\nextent that the vessels were distended, and threatened to burst, and\r\nsometimes actually did burst with considerable violence. Asbestos\r\nmillboard was then substituted for the felt, and the difficulty and\r\ndanger were then removed; gas was no longer evolved, whilst the\r\noperation of soldering could be performed with safety, the material\r\nremaining perfectly unaltered.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of time-fuzes again, asbestos washers are found most\r\nvaluable. Washers of india-rubber and wash-leather were formerly used,\r\nbut these in time became hard, and acted on the metal surfaces with\r\nwhich they came in contact in such a manner as to cement them together,\r\ninstead of keeping them mobile, and it was not until the introduction of\r\nasbestos washers that difficulties in connection with the proper action\r\nof these ingenious contrivances for the explosion of shells in a given\r\ntime after their discharge, were removed.\r\n\r\nOne of the latest uses to which asbestos has been proposed to be applied\r\nin connection with warfare is as a coating for ironclads. It is alleged\r\nby the inventor of the process that if asbestos be packed between the\r\narmour-plates it will arrest, or certainly minimise, the inflow of water\r\nafter the penetration of a ship's side below the water-line. This has\r\nalready been tried by the Admiralty, and an interesting account of the\r\ntrial may be found in the _Army and Navy Gazette Supplement_, for August\r\n28, of last year, and in the _Globe_ of the previous evening. Should the\r\nresults of further trials corroborate the success of the first, it is\r\nmanifest that a great impetus will be given to the asbestos trade,\r\nwhilst it will, at the same time, raise confidence in our fighting\r\nships, by practically preventing them from becoming waterlogged in\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAn eminent firm of manufacturers in New York have recently supplied,\r\nunder contract with the United States Government, a quilting for boiler\r\ncovers for their model warships, the _Dolphin_, _Chicago_, _Atlantic_,\r\nand _Boston_. These quiltings weigh about two pounds to the square foot,\r\nand are at all times removable. The same firm make removable pipe\r\ncoverings a speciality.\r\n\r\nCertainly some of the uses to which this mineral is now being put are\r\nsufficiently astonishing. Who, for instance, could have imagined that a\r\nsubstance of such comparative specific gravity as crude asbestos could\r\nhave been manufactured into a cloth available for aeronautical purposes\r\nin which absence of weight is of such primary importance? Yet here it\r\nappears to be the one thing wanting to give success to that despair of\r\naeronauts, military ballooning. Many years have now passed away since\r\nscientific military men first turned their attention to this subject;\r\nand it is now long since the War Department of the Government first\r\nauthorized experiments to be made with the view of utilising balloons in\r\nwarfare, and notwithstanding all the time and money which has been\r\nexpended, until now the result in the way of practical success has been\r\n_nil_. No use of balloons was made even in the late Egyptian campaign,\r\nwhich shows that up to that date English military men had no great faith\r\nin their usefulness or availability.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties to be encountered are doubtless sufficiently\r\nformidable. Gas, it is clear, could not be carried into a hostile\r\ncountry or into remote and nearly inaccessible districts. Even if\r\nprocurable at all near the battle-field it could only be obtained by a\r\nlong and difficult process of generation at the very time when speed and\r\nsimplicity would be the main factors of success. Gas, therefore, being\r\npractically out of the question, it seems to have occurred to Mr.\r\nSpencer, the well-known balloon manufacturer, that it would be better\r\nafter all to revert to the original conception of Montgolfier. The\r\nold-fashioned fire-ball, which acquired its power of ascension from\r\nrarefied air produced by burning straw or something similar, was, of\r\ncourse, of far too dangerous a character, and had been productive of far\r\ntoo many fatal accidents. It remained, therefore, to construct a balloon\r\nof some uninflammable material, in order to obviate this difficulty; and\r\nwith the assistance of his friend, Mr. Fisher, the Secretary of the\r\nUnited Asbestos Company of London, he ultimately succeeded in so doing.\r\nA balloon was accordingly constructed, the whole of the lower part of\r\nwhich was formed of fine asbestos cloth, and the remainder of canvas,\r\ncovered with a fireproof solution. The first trial took place in the\r\ngrounds of the Welsh Harp, at Hendon, and this has since been repeated\r\nat Chatham, under the inspection of the Royal Engineers' Committee, and\r\non both occasions, I am informed, with success. The balloon, which was a\r\nmodel only, stood about 30 feet high, and was suspended between two\r\nuprights, between which it hung down like a limp rag. It was of a\r\ncylindrical shape, having a deep zone at the equator, and a containing\r\ncapacity of about 300 feet. Attached to the neck was a copper\r\nspirit-lamp. As soon as a light was put to the spirit the inflation\r\ncommenced, and the balloon was fully distended in a space of about five\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe immense advantage gained by this method over the tedious and\r\ndifficult process of inflation by gas, even under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, is sufficiently obvious, whilst it is at the same time\r\napparent that the quantity of spirit requisite for an endless number of\r\nascents could be carried about with the greatest facility. Another\r\nadvantage remains to be considered, in that whilst the large volume of\r\ngas required for an ordinary balloon is in itself deleterious, the\r\nrarefied air in the new fireproof balloon is perfectly innocuous, and it\r\ncan be raised or lowered at will simply by turning the neck of the lamp\r\na little up or down. It is perhaps somewhat superfluous to say that the\r\nRussian Government at once adopted these balloons for war purposes.\r\n\r\nIn further continuance of this part of the subject, that is the\r\napplication of asbestos to matters connected with warfare, the\r\nparticulars of a very interesting experiment, which may have an\r\nimportant bearing on the carriage of explosive material in time of war,\r\nwas given by Mr. Boyd, the manager of the United Asbestos Company's\r\nworks at Harefield, of whom I have already spoken, and to whom I have\r\nbeen considerably indebted for much practical information, in a paper\r\nread by him before the Society of Arts, on an occasion when, through his\r\nkindness, I had an opportunity of being present. He was referring to the\r\nvalue of asbestos millboard as a lining for fireproof cases and deed\r\nboxes. The matter, he said, was put to a practical test thus: two iron\r\nrails were supported on brickwork at a height of about eighteen inches\r\nfrom the ground, and underneath them a strong fire of wood shavings and\r\nchips was made, and when this had well burnt up, a deed box filled with\r\npapers was pushed along the rails to the centre of the fire, where it\r\nwas completely enveloped in the flames, and there it remained for a\r\nspace of twenty minutes. On the box being withdrawn it unlocked easily,\r\nand the papers were found in perfect preservation, being neither charred\r\nnor discoloured.\r\n\r\nOn seeing this result, one of the gentlemen present asked if the boxes\r\ncould not be used for transporting gunpowder or other explosive\r\nsubstances. A quarter of a pound of powder was then put in a small bag,\r\nand placed inside a fresh box, which was pushed along the rails into the\r\ncentre of the fire, to which fresh fuel had been added. Those present\r\nwithdrew to a respectful distance, evidently, said Mr. Boyd, not yet\r\nhaving absolute faith in the heat-resisting properties of asbestos; and\r\nafter the box had been exposed to the fire for twenty minutes the\r\nquestion naturally arose how it was to be got off again. The manager\r\nhimself performed that operation by means of a long iron rod and hook,\r\nafter which the box was again opened and the powder found intact. The\r\nquestion was then asked by some one present who was not yet satisfied,\r\n\"Why have the powder in a bag? Let it be laid on the bottom of the box\r\nloose.\" This was done, and the fire ordeal repeated, again with the same\r\nresult. Nothing could well be more interesting or more suggestive to\r\nevery one connected with the asbestos industry than the foregoing.\r\n\r\nAs a final instance of its applicability for purposes connected with\r\nwarfare, it may be interesting to mention that I have lately seen it\r\nstated that the fibre would be of great value for use as lint in\r\nhospitals and on the battle-field. Of this I am unable to speak, but if\r\nit be a fact that it can be so used in favourable comparison with the\r\nbest lint, as stated, it is certain that its imperishable quality would\r\nbe of great advantage, seeing that it could be used over and over again,\r\nonly needing to be purified by passing it through fire after each time\r\nof using.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the use of asbestos in connection with building operations,\r\nmuch attention is now being given to this in a variety of ways, in\r\nAmerica especially. The building laws of Boston, New York, and\r\nPhiladelphia pay special attention to this, and many material\r\nalterations have been required to be made in consequence in the fittings\r\nof several important public buildings, whilst the use of the mineral is,\r\nI believe, rendered compulsory on those wishing to procure licences for\r\nthe erection of new theatres, libraries, concert halls, &c. At the\r\nAmerican Academy of Music, in Philadelphia, the underwriters went so far\r\nas to offer a reduction of one per cent. per annum provided an asbestos\r\ncurtain was placed in the house. The Fire Apparatus Committee then, it\r\nis reported, succeeded in perfecting \"the only barrier of complete\r\nprotection to an audience against fire in the world.\" This curtain, made\r\nof asbestos cloth (97 per cent. pure asbestos and 3 per cent. cotton) is\r\n54 feet wide and 53 feet high. It is hung on wire lines, three-eighths\r\nof an inch thick, connecting with a drum located in the apex of the\r\nroof, and can be raised with ease by two men and lowered by one.\r\n\r\nAgain, after the disaster at the Ring Strasse Theatre, at Vienna, when\r\nattention was drawn to the great danger arising from the want of some\r\ncertain and rapidly applicable means of separating the stage from the\r\nbody of the theatre, the Roman Minister of Public Security issued an\r\norder that every theatre should be fitted with a fireproof curtain\r\ncapable of entirely isolating the stage from the theatre, and he\r\nindicated an asbestos cloth curtain as one that would meet the case. All\r\nthe principal Roman theatres are now supplied with these curtains, the\r\nmaterial having been furnished by the United Asbestos Company of London.\r\nThe same company has also recently fitted a similar curtain for use at\r\nthe Theatre Royal in Manchester. This is formed of an iron frame holding\r\nthe asbestos curtain.\r\n\r\nAsbestos fireproof curtains are also in use at the New National\r\nTheatre, Washington; the Criterion, Brooklyn; and in the theatre at\r\nCleveland, Ohio. They have also lately been supplied to several English\r\ntheatres, as well as that at Manchester just mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe terrible calamity at the Opéra Comique in Paris, coupled with that\r\nwhich so recently occurred at the burning of the theatre at Exeter,\r\nagain set men's minds running in the direction of greater security from\r\nfire in theatres. As a consequence several varieties of curtains, all\r\ninvolving the use of asbestos, have been contrived. For instance, at the\r\nbuilding of that pretty little theatre (Terry's) in the Strand it was\r\nresolved to replace the usual heavy, cumbrous, slow-lifting iron shield\r\nby a single light-grey asbestos curtain, which moves up and down as\r\neasily as an ordinary window-blind. And the authorities agree that this\r\nis as valuable a protection to the audience as the former ponderous iron\r\nportcullis which, winding slowly up and down, was calculated to depress\r\nthe nerves of the audience in the same way that passers-by in the street\r\nare affected by the harsh grating of the iron shop shutters when being\r\nwound down for the night.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the proposals for a new \"Safety Theatre,\" brought to the\r\nnotice of the public by Mr. Henry Irving, stress is naturally laid on\r\nthe necessity of sealing the stage, or shutting it off from the\r\nauditorium, so that in the event of fire its perils might be confined to\r\nitself, and to providing an outlet for the smoke, which is often more\r\ndisastrous in its effects even than the flames. This he proposed to\r\naccomplish by means of an asbestos curtain which, on being dropped,\r\nwould at once become rigid with the wall on either side. This curtain\r\nwas proposed to be worked in iron grooves going straight up to the\r\ngridiron floor; and the suggestion was made that this should be used as\r\nconstantly as the ordinary act-drop, there being at the same time\r\nnothing to prevent its being made as ornamental as the usual curtain.\r\nIt could also be worked as easily, and be just as easily lifted for a\r\nrecall. The audience, it was said, would thus have the satisfaction of\r\nknowing that every time the curtain was dropped they were effectually\r\nprotected by a fireproof screen, which could be lowered with the same\r\nrapidity as the present curtain.\r\n\r\nIn continuation of this subject it may be worth mentioning, as showing\r\nthe amount of attention which is now being directed to this important\r\nmatter, that an experiment was recently made in the neighbourhood of\r\nOxford Street to test the fire-resisting qualities of another new\r\ncurtain for the stage, said to have been invented by Captain Heath. This\r\nexperiment took place within a specially built hoarding, within which\r\nthere was erected a large model of the Drury Lane stage proscenium.\r\nCaptain Heath explained to the company, invited to witness the\r\nexperiment, that the curtain was made of asbestos and canvas, and was\r\nrolled on a block of wood placed underneath the front part of the stage,\r\nwhere it occupied an otherwise useless space, and in no way interfered\r\nwith the business of the theatre. The sides of the model were made of\r\niron plates, and the front entirely of wood. When certain catches were\r\nreleased counterbalancing weights came into action, and the curtain was\r\nrun rapidly up from below. On reaching the top, it pressed tightly and\r\nautomatically against the back of the proscenium, turning on at the same\r\ntime a supply of water from a perforated pipe which ran along the whole\r\nlength of the top of the curtain so as to keep it constantly wet. The\r\narrangement of the switch used for communicating action to the curtain\r\nwas such as to turn on the water and close the curtain against the sides\r\nat will. He also stated that communication with the lever of the switch\r\ncould be fitted to any part of the theatre. A very severe fire test was\r\nemployed. The model was first filled with inflammable materials such as\r\nshavings and large blocks of wood, over which petroleum was poured. At a\r\ngiven signal the curtain was raised and the fire lighted. The flames at\r\nonce rose, accompanied with volumes of smoke, none of which, however,\r\nfound their way to the front of the proscenium. The interior looked like\r\na furnace. But so effectually were the flames shut off that it was\r\npossible to sit on the fore part of the stage without feeling the heat,\r\nthe only thing noticeable being the steam arising from the wet canvas.\r\nThis, Captain Heath explained, might be obviated by painting the canvas\r\nin oils. The fire burned fiercely for half an hour, and the universal\r\nopinion of those present was that the curtain was perfectly fireproof,\r\nand that its construction was as simple as it was useful for the purpose\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nWhilst these sheets are still in the press, yet another theatre dies the\r\napparently natural death of all such structures, that is, by fire.\r\nPortugal is this time the scene of the disaster, the sufferer being the\r\nBaquet Theatre in Oporto. The calamity was caused by the wings catching\r\nfire from a gas-jet, whereby the whole of the stage scenery was almost,\r\nimmediately afterwards enveloped in flames, the furious progress of\r\nwhich it was found impossible to arrest. Here, then, was a striking\r\ninstance of a holocaust being caused by the want of such a curtain as\r\nhas been described; for, had such a thing been available, the stage\r\nwould have been at once shut off from the auditorium, and even if it had\r\nnot been found possible to save the structure, the fire, at any rate,\r\nwould have been localised for a sufficient length of time, to have\r\nenabled the authorities to clear the building, and so have prevented the\r\npanic and horror which ensued, and the fearful sacrifice of life which\r\nhumanity now deplores.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while perhaps recording the foregoing, because there can be\r\nvery little doubt that something of this kind will presently be made\r\ncompulsory even in England for use in theatres and music halls\r\ngenerally. And it is believed, from the course matters are now taking in\r\nthe United States, that the use of asbestos in some form or other will\r\nbe made compulsory there for the shelvings and doors of public libraries\r\nand places for the custody of records, for sheathings between wooden\r\nfloorings and below carpets, for hearthstones, for the linings and doors\r\nof elevators or lifts, and for the better preservation of Pullman cars\r\nfrom fire.\r\n\r\nThe premises of the American Watch Case Company, of Toronto, have their\r\nfloorings protected by an asbestos covering, and I saw an announcement\r\nrecently in the _Sherbrooke Gazette_ that this covering had saved their\r\npremises from destruction by a fire which had occurred there. In\r\nconnection with this part of the subject it may be added that various\r\nattempts have been made for the introduction of asbestos into the\r\nmanufacture of lace curtains, dresses, &c., but I believe that the\r\nprincipal obstacle in the way of success in this line lies in the fact\r\nthat in its present state, in the shape of curtains, for instance, it is\r\nfound to be an obstinate holder of dust. This objection will, no doubt,\r\nbe presently got rid of; and soon we may hope to have heard the last of\r\nthose fearful scenes which have at times occurred from the firing of\r\nladies' dresses at the footlights in theatres.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier Aldini's idea, previously mentioned, has been recently\r\nrevived in Paris, the firemen there having been furnished with asbestos\r\nclothes. Immediately after this was done it was reported in the papers\r\nthat on a conflagration occurring in the basement of a building there,\r\nthe firemen arrived, clad in their asbestos suits, and were thereby\r\nenabled to descend at once into the basement, where they extinguished\r\nthe fire in a very short time, and so prevented what might have been a\r\ngreat calamity. And according to the papers it appears that the same\r\ncourse is now about to be taken in England, and the London firemen at\r\nany rate protected in a similar manner; and there can be little doubt\r\nthat this course will presently be universally adopted for the\r\nprotection of the men engaged in saving life and property from\r\ndestruction by fire. Nothing has yet been discovered that will equal\r\nasbestos for this purpose. It will neither burn nor smoulder, and is as\r\nimpervious to fire as well made mackintosh is to water.\r\n\r\nManufactured into cloth and paper, it is in use in sugar refineries,\r\nchemical laboratories, &c., for straining and other purposes, especially\r\nfor filtering acids and similar fluids. A coarser kind of cloth is used\r\nfor stokers and furnacemen's aprons, for salvage blankets, and gloves. A\r\nspecial quality of glove made of asbestos cloth, lined with rubber, is\r\nsupplied for electric light work.\r\n\r\nA further development of the industry is indicated by the announcement\r\nthat a New York manufacturing firm has recently taken over a large\r\ncontract for the manufacture of mail bags out of asbestos cloth.\r\n\r\nIt is also proposed to be used as an inner sole or lining for boots and\r\nshoes with the object of keeping the feet warm in winter and cool in\r\nsummer, the material possessing the double advantage of being at once a\r\npreserver of heat and a protector from cold.\r\n\r\nFor cold storage buildings it will doubtless be found invaluable. There\r\nare buildings in New York, principally for fish preservation, which are\r\nbuilt with double walls surrounding the cold chambers, having some kind\r\nof non-conducting material between the walls by way of lining. For this\r\npurpose asbestos would be unsurpassed, and the cheap No. 3 quality would\r\nanswer perfectly well.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyd, in the lecture before referred to, says that some years ago,\r\nwhen resident at Genoa, he was one of the members of a committee for\r\nprocuring a new floating chapel for the use of seamen. The old chapel\r\nwas built on the deck of a hulk, but the extremely high summer\r\ntemperature caused the repairs to be both frequent and costly. The\r\ncommittee therefore wanted the new chapel to be built of iron, but were\r\ndeterred by the fear that its roof and sides, exposed to the sun, would\r\nget so hot as to render the interior unbearable. He therefore proposed\r\nto fill up the space between the outer skin and the inner boarding with\r\nasbestos ground to a rough powder; and this suggestion was adopted, the\r\npowder being tightly rammed in by the carpenters. The result, he informs\r\nus, was so successful that whilst the outside temperature stood at 100°,\r\nthe temperature inside, when doors and windows were kept shut, did not\r\nexceed 70°. And he therefore suggests that asbestos powder might be used\r\nin a similar way for rendering the deck cabins of steamers navigating\r\nthe Red Sea and Suez Canal more comfortable for the passengers.\r\n\r\nFor wall and ornamental papers it is being largely used, and a superior\r\nquality of asbestos writing paper is now being made in Paris. One can\r\neasily imagine a great future in this line for asbestos paper written or\r\nprinted on with asbestos ink for all kinds of registers and permanent\r\nrecords, bankers' and merchants' books, and the like. One of the leading\r\nmanufacturers in New York already prints his price lists on asbestos\r\npaper. And another has on show fine papers as susceptible of receiving\r\ngood impressions from type as any in use in modern books. Coloured wall\r\npapers also are manufactured in great variety, which are not merely\r\nincombustible, but practically indestructible by fire; and which retain,\r\neven after severe heat tests, their colourings, markings and letterings\r\nas clearly impressed and as vividly visible as before. Boards also are\r\nmade of asbestos, varying from the thinnest and lightest card to heavy\r\nshelving, fit either for partitions in safes or for use in large\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nIn a recent number of \"L'Industrie Moderne\" I found an account of a new\r\nprocess invented by a Mr. Ladewig for manufacturing pulp and paper from\r\nasbestos fibre, which he asserts will not only resist the action of both\r\nfire and water, but will absorb no moisture; this pulp, he says, may be\r\nused as a stuffing and for the joints of engines. He further proposes to\r\nuse it in the form of a solid cardboard as a roofing material for light\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nThe process of manufacture consists in mixing about 25 per cent. of\r\nasbestos fibre with about 25 or 35 per cent. of powdered sulphate of\r\nalumina. This mixture is moistened with an aqueous solution of chloride\r\nof zinc. The mixture is washed with water and then treated with an\r\naqueous solution of ammoniacal gas. The mixture is again washed and then\r\ntreated with a solution composed of one part of resin soap and eight or\r\nten parts of water mixed with an equal bulk of sulphate of alumina,\r\nwhich should be us pure as possible. The mixture thus obtained should\r\nhave a slightly pulpy consistency. Finally, there is added to it 35 per\r\ncent. of powdered asbestos and 5 to 8 per cent. of white barytes. This\r\npulp is treated with water in an ordinary paper machine, and worked just\r\nlike paper pulp.\r\n\r\nIn order to manufacture a solid cardboard from asbestos which shall be\r\nproof against fire and water and capable of serving as a roofing\r\nmaterial, sheets of common cardboard, tarred or otherwise prepared, are\r\ncovered with the pulp. The application is made in a paper machine, the\r\npulp being allowed to flow over the cardboard. Among other uses, the\r\nasbestos paper has been recommended for the manufacture of cigarettes,\r\nthough its applicability for this purpose is not so readily seen.\r\n\r\nManufactured into paint, the demand for it is continually increasing.\r\nIt is used in the Houses of Parliament, as it was in very large\r\nquantities at the several recent exhibitions at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nIn the form of cement there is nothing equal to it as an efficient\r\ncovering for boilers, steam pipes, hotblast furnaces, stills, &c. For\r\nthis purpose it is made of about the consistency of mortar and spread on\r\nwith a trowel in the ordinary way. Certain chemical ingredients have to\r\nbe added, which, while not injurious to the metal, cause the asbestos to\r\nadhere firmly to the plates, so that when dry it becomes quite hard and\r\ncan be walked over without being injured. With a boiler carrying say 80\r\nlbs. steam pressure, the application of from 1-½ to 2 inches of this\r\ncomposition so well retains the heat in the boiler, that a thermometer\r\nwith the bulb held close to the outer surface of the covering will not\r\nindicate more than 80° to 85° Fahrenheit. Boilers, steam pipes, &c.,\r\ncovered in with this composition will, it is asserted by the\r\nmanufacturers, effect a saving of as much as 33 per cent. in fuel.[10]\r\n\r\nThis cement, which is made from a very cheap quality of asbestos, is now\r\nin common use in Canada and the States, where, as already shown, it is\r\nfound to operate with a twofold effect, viz. by lowering the temperature\r\nof the boilerhouse, to the great comfort of the engineers and firemen,\r\nand also, in a very marked degree, economising the expenditure for fuel.\r\nIt seems, therefore, strange that its use in this country has as yet\r\nmade so little headway. In one of the large palatial buildings recently\r\nerected in London, where engines are required to be in constant work for\r\npumping water for working the lifts and for general purposes, as well as\r\nfor the dynamos, the heat from the boilers forms so great a nuisance,\r\nand occasions so much loss in other ways, that very considerable expense\r\nis about to be incurred, with a view to lowering the temperature. When\r\nconversing recently with an expert on this subject I asked whether the\r\nuse of asbestos would not effect the desired object. Yes, he answered,\r\nit would, but it is too expensive. This certainly seems very strange, as\r\nI know that the cement composition referred to is made of the very\r\ncommonest quality of asbestos, of the refuse, in point of fact, which\r\ncould probably be used for no other purpose. The expense, therefore,\r\ncannot be great, and as to its mode of use, it is simply laid on with a\r\ntrowel, like mortar or any similar composition, and when once done is\r\nsingularly effective. I have stood in an engine-house where the boilers\r\nwere covered with about two inches in thickness of this cement, which\r\nthen showed a hard, dry, firm surface; and, when the engines were in\r\nfull work, on placing one's hand on the covering there was little more\r\nthan a gentle warmth perceptible on the outside surface of the\r\ncomposition, whilst the surrounding atmosphere was scarcely, if at all,\r\naffected by the heat from the boilers. The boiler quiltings referred to\r\non a previous page as being manufactured by a New York firm under\r\ncontract with the United States Government, for use in some of their\r\nmodel war ships, would no doubt be as effectual for the purpose, but\r\nnaturally they would be more costly, being an altogether different\r\ncontrivance, and made so as to be easily removable when required, which,\r\nof course, is not the case with the so-called cement. There is little\r\ndoubt, however, that, although the use of asbestos in this form does not\r\nseem to find much favour here, its use for the purpose of coating\r\nboilers and steam-pipes will presently become as general in England as\r\nit already is on the other side, where its valuable qualities seem to be\r\nso much better known and appreciated.\r\n\r\nImproved stove pipings are now being manufactured in the States which in\r\nappearance exactly resemble cast-iron. These have the additional\r\nvaluable properties of extreme lightness, combined with great strength\r\nand a capability of ornamentation unobtainable with the usual cast-iron\r\npipes mostly in use; paint in the case of the asbestos pipes not scaling\r\noff under heat as it will do in the case of ordinary iron pipes. The\r\nmanufacturers of these pipes claim for them that they combine the\r\nstrength of steel with the lightness of paper. Tubes also are made for\r\nelectrical engineers which provide them with a non-conducting covering\r\nfor their wires both fire and waterproof, so as to preserve the perfect\r\ninsulation of the wire.\r\n\r\nAsbestos rope is used for fire escapes and similar purposes, as well as\r\nfor the transmission of power over places exposed to heat. In dyeing and\r\nprinting cloth it is frequently necessary to hang the fabric in loops\r\nfrom parallel rods for exposure to steam, air or ammonia. In order that\r\nit should hold upon the rods, without straining or slipping, rope or\r\nstrips of cloth are usually wound around the poles, but this does not\r\nremove, although it mitigates, the difficulty, because the heat and\r\ncorrosive action of the vapours will rot any covering; the first notice\r\nof the deterioration being generally the appearance of small pieces of\r\nrod covering among the cloth which is in process of finishing. Asbestos\r\nrope and cloth are now largely manufactured and used for this purpose\r\nin the United States with very beneficial results.\r\n\r\nIn commenting on the recent loss of life occasioned by the panic at the\r\nfire at the Exeter Theatre, a well-known journal, speaking of the\r\nvarious modes of providing for escape, mentions the case of a man of\r\nfashion, a millionaire, who died not long ago, and says that he would\r\nnever go to bed in a strange house without having an apparatus of\r\nknotted rope affixed to a ring in the wall, by which he might lower\r\nhimself to the ground on an emergency. But, asks the journalist, what if\r\nthe rope itself took fire? The answer naturally is, let it be an\r\nasbestos rope, then it will neither burn nor rot.\r\n\r\nThe use of the fibre in the manufacture of gas stoves is too well known\r\nto need any remark.\r\n\r\nAs a lubricant it is unrivalled.\r\n\r\nAnother very important use to which it is now being applied is in the\r\nmanufacture of filters. These are specially useful where the liquid to\r\nbe filtered is of a caustic or strongly acid nature, or where the filter\r\nwith residue is to be ignited without consuming the filter, or where the\r\nresidue is to be subsequently dissolved off the filter by acids or other\r\nsolvents. In many cases a very finely divided asbestos is desirable.\r\nThis is accomplished by a process recently patented in Germany by Fr.\r\nBreyer, of Vienna. The asbestos is first coarsely ground, and then mixed\r\nwith some granular crystalline carbonate, which must be soluble in\r\nacids. The carbonate should possess a hardness between 3 and 4, 5,\r\naccording to the mineralogical scale. The mixture is ultimately ground\r\ntogether in a mill. Afterwards the mass is treated with an acid until\r\nthe carbonate has been dissolved out. The escaping carbonic gas causes\r\nthe asbestos fibres to be loosened and disintegrated from each other so\r\nas to render the mass porous. Of course it must be thoroughly washed\r\nwith water before being used.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the purification of foul gas, as well as for ventilating and\r\ndeodorizing man-holes for cesspools, sewers, &c., its use is found to be\r\nunsurpassed by any other known material.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyd, in the paper so often referred to, says in regard to this,\r\nthat he was some time previously asked to supply asbestos yarn spun in\r\nsuch a way as to have good capillary action, and, on making inquiry,\r\nfound it was to be used for the above purpose. In describing the mode of\r\nusing it, he says that there is placed over the opening rising from the\r\nsewer a hood of galvanized wire, interlaced with this asbestos yarn, the\r\nends of the yarn dipping into a receptacle filled with liquid\r\ndisinfectant, which, as they become saturated, form a disinfecting\r\nscreen, through the meshes of which the gases rise, and in their passage\r\nthrough are purified and rendered innocuous. The system hitherto\r\npreviously adopted for deodorizing sewer gas has been to cause it to\r\nrise through charcoal, but it is found that the impurities soon clog\r\nthis up, and simply prevent the passage of the gas, whereas in the\r\narrangement just mentioned (which is that of Messrs. Adams & Co., of\r\nYork), the gas rises freely, and is perfectly deodorized.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, very numerous other applications of the material\r\nwhich might be referred to or described, but probably those already\r\nmentioned are the most important and the most interesting; and these, it\r\nis hoped, are at any rate sufficient to indicate the great value of this\r\nsingular mineral product, as well as to confirm the statement with which\r\nI started, that this is indeed one of Nature's most marvellous\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] There is a Patent Removable Covering now manufactured in New York\r\nwhich is said to be entirely formed of pure asbestos fibre, made in\r\ncylindrical sections of three-foot lengths of the exact size of the\r\npipes to be covered. In this the asbestos fibres are so interlaced, that\r\nthe sections, whilst possessing strength and flexibility, afford so\r\nlarge a number of air-cells as to give the covering the very highest\r\nnon-conducting quality, whilst at the same time it cannot char or be in\r\nany way injured by the most intense heat from without or within. Fire\r\nFelt sectional coverings for boilers and large surfaces are made in\r\nconvenient forms in sheets, &c. The same Company also manufacture what\r\nis called a Superator Jacket, both fire and waterproof, being in fact a\r\nflexible sheet of asbestos strengthened with wire netting, the asbestos\r\nbeing waterproofed by a special process, and provided with patent\r\nlacings, so that the jackets may be effectually kept in place, whilst\r\nbeing readily removable without cutting or loss of material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n Asbestos, meaning of, 5\r\n   description, 7, 9\r\n   origin unknown, 12\r\n   only found in serpentine, 12\r\n   places where found, 13\r\n   first successful experiments with, 15\r\n   difference between Canadian and Italian, 16, 22\r\n   where used, 18\r\n   analysis, 20\r\n   Italian kinds, 21\r\n   sources of supply, 13, 24\r\n   marketable value, 28\r\n   first discovery of, 29\r\n   profitable nature of mining for, 31, 51\r\n   annual production, 52\r\n   aggregate output, 51\r\n   uses of, 55\r\n\r\n Aldini, Chevalier, 15, 18, 66\r\n\r\n Amiante, 8\r\n\r\n Anecdotes, 5, 13, 54, 60\r\n\r\n Anglo-Canadian Company, 27, 36\r\n\r\n Antimony, 48\r\n\r\n\r\n Ballooning, military, 58\r\n\r\n Bastard asbestos, 27\r\n\r\n Boiler coverings, 58, 70\r\n\r\n Boot soles, lining for, 67\r\n\r\n Boston Company's mine, 31\r\n\r\n Breeches of big guns, 56\r\n\r\n Broughton mines, 42\r\n\r\n Building operations, use in, 61\r\n\r\n\r\n Canadian mineral estates, typical, 48\r\n\r\n Carriage of explosives, 60\r\n\r\n China, strange use of asbestos in, 15\r\n\r\n Cement, 70\r\n\r\n Chrome iron, 28, 36, 51\r\n\r\n Chrysotile, 8\r\n\r\n Cloth and paper, 67\r\n\r\n Clothing for firemen, 66\r\n\r\n Coating ironclads, 57\r\n\r\n Cobbing, 52\r\n\r\n Cold storage, 67\r\n\r\n Coleraine group of mines, 36\r\n\r\n Coleraine mines of Dr. Reed, 41\r\n\r\n Cost of extraction, 36, 40\r\n\r\n Coste, Eugène, report of, 52\r\n\r\n Crocidolite, 9, 10\r\n\r\n Curtains in theatres, 62\r\n\r\n\r\n Danville, mine at, 46\r\n\r\n Deck cabins of steamships, 68\r\n\r\n Discolouration, 27, 33, 37\r\n   removable, 38\r\n\r\n\r\n Ells (Mr.), report of, 12, 31, 41, 50\r\n\r\n Exeter Theatre, fire at, 63\r\n\r\n Exhibition, American, 9\r\n\r\n Extraction, cost of, 36, 40\r\n\r\n\r\n Faults in veins, 47\r\n\r\n Filters, 67, 73\r\n\r\n Firemen's clothing, 16, 66\r\n\r\n Fires at theatres, 62\r\n\r\n Fireproof boxes, 58\r\n   curtains, 62\r\n\r\n Frechette-Douville mine, 39\r\n\r\n French-Canadian labour, 53\r\n\r\n\r\n Genoa, floating chapel at, 68\r\n\r\n Geology of Canada, 7, 9, 26, 48\r\n\r\n Gold at South Ham, 49\r\n\r\n\r\n Heath, Captain, experiments of, 61\r\n\r\n\r\n Immature asbestos, 32\r\n\r\n Impurity of rock, 27\r\n\r\n Ink, asbestos, 68\r\n\r\n Italian asbestos, 15\r\n   paper on, 19\r\n\r\n Italy, experiments in, 15\r\n\r\n Italian asbestos, three kinds of, 21\r\n\r\n Iron-mining in Russia, 13\r\n\r\n Irving's safety theatre, 63\r\n\r\n\r\n Johnson Company's mine, 30\r\n\r\n Journal of Society of Arts, 19\r\n\r\n\r\n Kennedy's discovery at Coleraine, 42\r\n\r\n King's mine, 32\r\n\r\n\r\n Limestone at Templeton, 29\r\n\r\n Lint, 61\r\n\r\n\r\n Magnetite, 33\r\n\r\n Mailbags, 67\r\n\r\n Main sources of supply, 24\r\n\r\n Marketable value, how determined, 28\r\n\r\n Martin mine, 38\r\n\r\n Merchants' and bankers' books, 68\r\n\r\n Military ballooning, 58\r\n\r\n Mineral wool, 11\r\n\r\n Miner's lamps, 56\r\n\r\n Mining in Canada, 24\r\n   profitable nature of, 31, 51\r\n\r\n\r\n Packing, 52\r\n\r\n Paint, 69\r\n\r\n Paper, 67, 68\r\n\r\n Peculiarity at Thetford, 33\r\n\r\n Pélé's hair, 11\r\n\r\n Pierre-à-coton, 7\r\n\r\n Places where used, 18\r\n\r\n Profitable nature of asbestos-mining in Canada, 31, 51\r\n\r\n Printing papers, 68\r\n\r\n Pulp and paper, 69\r\n\r\n Purification of foul gas, 74\r\n\r\n\r\n Reed & Hay properties, 40\r\n\r\n Reed's (Dr.), mine, 40\r\n\r\n Registers and records, 68\r\n\r\n Relative merits of Canadian and Italian asbestos, 17\r\n\r\n Rope, 72\r\n\r\n Russia, asbestos found in, 13, 14\r\n   iron-mining in, 13\r\n\r\n\r\n Scottish Asbestos Company, 36, 38, 44\r\n\r\n Serpentine, 12, 24, 41\r\n   often impure, 27\r\n   ornamental, 29\r\n\r\n Shipton mine, 46\r\n\r\n Singular statement, 20\r\n\r\n Slag wool, 11\r\n\r\n Soapstone (steatite), 46, 49\r\n   enormous quantity of, at South Ham, 49\r\n\r\n South Ham, mines at, 47\r\n\r\n Steam-power, 34\r\n\r\n Steam-pipe coverings, 70\r\n\r\n Stove pipings, 72\r\n\r\n\r\n Theatres, fires in, 62\r\n\r\n Thetford group of mines, 29\r\n   district rich in minerals, 36\r\n\r\n Time fuzes, 67\r\n\r\n Tunnelling impracticable in Canada, 21\r\n\r\n\r\n Underwriters, offer of, 62\r\n\r\n United Asbestos Company of London, 16, 60\r\n\r\n Ural region, large quantities found in, 14\r\n\r\n\r\n Wages at Canadian mines, 53\r\n\r\n Wall papers, 68\r\n\r\n Want of foresight in mining for asbestos, 35\r\n\r\n Ward's mine, 31\r\n\r\n Whitehead torpedoes, 56\r\n\r\n Willimott (Mr.), report of, 26\r\n\r\n Wolfestown mines, 50\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY J.
