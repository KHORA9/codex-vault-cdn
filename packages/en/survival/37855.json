This foundation was established September 17, 1918, by an\r\n  anonymous gift to Yale University in memory of Flight Sub-Lieutenant\r\n  Theodore L. Glasgow, R.N. He was born in Montreal, Canada, and was\r\n  educated at the University of Toronto Schools and at the Royal\r\n  Military College, Kingston. In August, 1916, he entered the Royal\r\n  Naval Air Service and in July, 1917, went to France with the Tenth\r\n  Squadron attached to the Twenty-second Wing of the Royal Flying\r\n  Corps. A month later, August 19, 1917, he was killed in action on\r\n  the Ypres front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO\r\n\r\n  THOMAS CHROWDER CHAMBERLIN\r\n\r\n  OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\r\n\r\n  WHOSE CLEAR AND MASTERLY DISCUSSION OF THE GREAT PROBLEMS\r\n  OF TERRESTRIAL EVOLUTION HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING\r\n  FACTORS IN THE WRITING OF THIS BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _There is a toy, which I have heard, and I would not have it given\r\n  over, but waited upon a little. They say it is observed in the Low\r\n  Countries (I know not in what part), that every five and thirty\r\n  years the same kind and suit of years and weathers comes about\r\n  again; as great frosts, great wet, great droughts, warm winters,\r\n  summers with little heat, and the like, and they call it the prime;\r\n  it is a thing I do the rather mention, because, computing backwards,\r\n  I have found some concurrence._\r\n\r\n  FRANCIS BACON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nUnity is perhaps the keynote of modern science. This means unity in\r\ntime, for the present is but the outgrowth of the past, and the future\r\nof the present. It means unity of process, for there seems to be no\r\nsharp dividing line between organic and inorganic, physical and mental,\r\nmental and spiritual. And the unity of modern science means also a\r\ngrowing tendency toward cooeperation, so that by working together\r\nscientists discover much that would else have remained hid.\r\n\r\nThis book illustrates the modern trend toward unity in all of these\r\nways. First, it is a companion volume to _Earth and Sun_. That volume is\r\na discussion of the causes of weather, but a consideration of the\r\nweather of the present almost inevitably leads to a study of the climate\r\nof the past. Hence the two books were written originally as one, and\r\nwere only separated from considerations of convenience. Second, the\r\nunity of nature is so great that when a subject such as climatic changes\r\nis considered, it is almost impossible to avoid other subjects, such as\r\nthe movements of the earth's crust. Hence this book not only discusses\r\nclimatic changes, but considers the causes of earthquakes and attempts\r\nto show how climatic changes may be related to great geological\r\nrevolutions in the form, location, and altitude of the lands. Thus the\r\nbook has a direct bearing on all the main physical factors which have\r\nmolded the evolution of organic life, including man.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, this volume illustrates the unity of modern science\r\nbecause it is preeminently a cooeperative product. Not only have the two\r\nauthors shared in its production, but several of the Yale Faculty have\r\nalso cooeperated. From the geological standpoint, Professor Charles\r\nSchuchert has read the entire manuscript in its final form as well as\r\nparts at various stages. He has helped not only by criticisms,\r\nsuggestions, and facts, but by paragraphs ready for the printer. In the\r\nsame way in the domain of physics, Professor Leigh Page has repeatedly\r\ntaken time to assist, and either in writing or by word of mouth has\r\ncontributed many pages. In astronomy, the same cordial cooeperation has\r\ncome with equal readiness from Professor Frank Schlesinger. Professors\r\nSchuchert, Schlesinger, and Page have contributed so materially that\r\nthey are almost co-authors of the volume. In mathematics, Professor\r\nErnest W. Brown has been similarly helpful, having read and criticised\r\nthe entire book. In certain chemical problems, Professor Harry W. Foote\r\nhas been our main reliance. The advice and suggestions of these men have\r\nfrequently prevented errors, and have again and again started new and\r\nprofitable lines of thought. If we have made mistakes, it has been\r\nbecause we have not profited sufficiently by their cooeperation. If the\r\nmain hypothesis of this book proves sound, it is largely because it has\r\nbeen built up in constant consultation with men who look at the problem\r\nfrom different points of vision. Our appreciation of their generous and\r\nunstinted cooeperation is much deeper than would appear from this brief\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\nOutside the Yale Faculty we have received equally cordial assistance.\r\nProfessor T. C. Chamberlin of the University of Chicago, to whom, with\r\nhis permission, we take great pleasure in dedicating this volume, has\r\nread the entire proof and has made many helpful suggestions. We cannot\r\nspeak too warmly of our appreciation not only of this, but of the way\r\nhis work has served for years as an inspiration in the preliminary work\r\nof gathering data for this volume. Professor Harlow Shapley of Harvard\r\nUniversity has contributed materially to the chapter on the sun and its\r\njourney through space; Professor Andrew E. Douglass of the University of\r\nArizona has put at our disposal some of his unpublished results;\r\nProfessors S. B. Woodworth and Reginald A. Daly, and Mr. Robert W.\r\nSayles of Harvard, and Professor Henry F. Reid of Johns Hopkins have\r\nsuggested new facts and sources of information; Professor E. R. Cumings\r\nof Indiana University has critically read the entire proof;\r\nconversations with Professor John P. Buwalda of the University of\r\nCalifornia while he was teaching at Yale make him another real\r\ncontributor; and Mr. Wayland Williams has contributed the interesting\r\nquotation from Bacon on page x of this book. Miss Edith S. Russell has\r\ntaken great pains in preparing the manuscript and in suggesting many\r\nchanges that make for clearness. Many others have also helped, but it is\r\nimpossible to make due acknowledgment because such contributions have\r\nbecome so thoroughly a part of the mental background of the book that\r\ntheir source is no longer distinct in the minds of the authors.\r\n\r\nThe division of labor between the two authors has not followed any set\r\nrules. Both have had a hand in all parts of the book. The main draft of\r\nChapters VII, VIII, IX, XI, and XIII was written by the junior author;\r\nhis contributions are also especially numerous in Chapters X and XV; the\r\nrest of the book was written originally by the senior author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                PAGE\r\n\r\n     I.

No human being can escape from the fact that his\r\nfood, clothing, shelter, recreation, occupation, health, and energy are\r\nall profoundly influenced by his climatic surroundings. A change of\r\nseason brings in its train some alteration in practically every phase of\r\nhuman activity. Animals are influenced by climate even more than man,\r\nfor they have not developed artificial means of protecting themselves.\r\nEven so hardy a creature as the dog becomes notably different with a\r\nchange of climate. The thick-haired \"husky\" of the Eskimos has outwardly\r\nlittle in common with the small and almost hairless canines that grovel\r\nunder foot in Mexico. Plants are even more sensitive than animals and\r\nmen. Scarcely a single species can flourish permanently in regions which\r\ndiffer more than 20 deg.C. in average yearly temperature, and for most the\r\nlimit of successful growth is 10 deg..[1] So far as we yet know every living\r\nspecies of plant and animal, including man, thrives best under definite\r\nand limited conditions of temperature, humidity, and sunshine, and of\r\nthe composition and movement of the atmosphere or water in which it\r\nlives. Any departure beyond the limits means lessened efficiency, and in\r\nthe long run a lower rate of reproduction and a tendency toward changes\r\nin specific characteristics. Any great departure means suffering or\r\ndeath for the individual and destruction for the species.\r\n\r\nSince climate has so profound an influence on life today, it has\r\npresumably been equally potent at other times. Therefore few scientific\r\nquestions are more important than how and why the earth's climate has\r\nvaried in the past, and what changes it is likely to undergo in the\r\nfuture. This book sets forth what appear to be the chief reasons for\r\nclimatic variations during historic and geologic times. It assumes that\r\ncauses which can now be observed in operation, as explained in a\r\ncompanion volume entitled _Earth and Sun_, and in such books as\r\nHumphreys' _Physics of the Air_, should be carefully studied before less\r\nobvious causes are appealed to. It also assumes that these same causes\r\nwill continue to operate, and are the basis of all valid predictions as\r\nto the weather or climate of the future.\r\n\r\nIn our analysis of climatic variations, we may well begin by inquiring\r\nhow the earth's climate has varied during geological history. Such an\r\ninquiry discloses three great tendencies, which to the superficial view\r\nseem contradictory. All, however, have a similar effect in providing\r\nconditions under which organic evolution is able to make progress. The\r\nfirst tendency is toward uniformity, a uniformity so pronounced and of\r\nsuch vast duration as to stagger the imagination. Superposed upon this\r\nthere seems to be a tendency toward complexity. During the greater part\r\nof geological history the earth's climate appears to have been\r\nrelatively monotonous, both from place to place and from season to\r\nseason; but since the Miocene the rule has been diversity and\r\ncomplexity, a condition highly favorable to organic evolution. Finally,\r\nthe uniformity of the vast eons of the past and the tendency toward\r\ncomplexity are broken by pulsatory changes, first in one direction and\r\nthen in another. To our limited human vision some of the changes, such\r\nas glacial periods, seem to be waves of enormous proportions, but\r\ncompared with the possibilities of the universe they are merely as the\r\nripples made by a summer zephyr.\r\n\r\nThe uniformity of the earth's climate throughout the vast stretches of\r\ngeological time can best be realized by comparing the range of\r\ntemperature on the earth during that period with the possible range as\r\nshown in the entire solar system. As may be seen in Table 1, the\r\ngeological record opens with the Archeozoic era, or \"Age of Unicellular\r\nLife,\" as it is sometimes called, for the preceding cosmic time has left\r\nno record that can yet be read. Practically no geologists now believe\r\nthat the beginning of the Archeozoic was less than one hundred million\r\nyears ago; and since the discovery of the peculiar properties of radium\r\nmany of the best students do not hesitate to say a billion or a billion\r\nand a half.[2] Even in the Archeozoic the rocks testify to a climate\r\nseemingly not greatly different from that of the average of geologic\r\ntime. The earth's surface was then apparently cool enough so that it was\r\ncovered with oceans and warm enough so that the water teemed with\r\nmicroscopic life. The air must have been charged with water vapor and\r\nwith carbon dioxide, for otherwise there seems to be no possible way of\r\nexplaining the formation of mudstones and sandstones, limestones of vast\r\nthickness, carbonaceous shales, graphites, and iron ores.[3] Although\r\nthe Archeozoic has yielded no generally admitted fossils, yet what seem\r\nto be massive algae and sponges have been found in Canada. On the other\r\nhand, abundant life is believed to have been present in the oceans, for\r\nby no other known means would it be possible to take from the air the\r\nvast quantities of carbon that now form carbonaceous shales and\r\ngraphite.\r\n\r\nIn the next geologic era, the Proterozoic, the researches of Walcott\r\nhave shown that besides the marine algae there must have been many other\r\nkinds of life. The Proterozoic fossils thus far discovered include not\r\nonly microscopic radiolarians such as still form the red ooze of the\r\ndeepest ocean floors, but the much more significant tubes of annelids or\r\nworms. The presence of the annelids, which are relatively high in the\r\nscale of organization, is generally taken to mean that more lowly forms\r\nof animals such as coelenterates and probably even the mollusca and\r\nprimitive arthropods must already have been evolved. That there were\r\nmany kinds of marine invertebrates living in the later Proterozoic is\r\nindicated by the highly varied life and more especially the trilobites\r\nfound in the oldest Cambrian strata of the next succeeding period. In\r\nfact the Cambrian has sponges, primitive corals, a great variety of\r\nbrachiopods, the beginnings of gastropods, a wonderful array of\r\ntrilobites, and other lowly forms of arthropods. Since, under the\r\npostulate of evolution, the life of that time forms an unbroken sequence\r\nwith that of the present, and since many of the early forms differ only\r\nin minor details from those of today, we infer that the climate then was\r\nnot very different from that of today. The same line of reasoning leads\r\nto the conclusion that even in the middle of the Proterozoic, when\r\nmulticellular marine animals must already have been common, the climate\r\nof the earth had already for an enormous period been such that all the\r\nlower types of oceanic invertebrates had already evolved.\r\n\r\nTABLE 1\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL TIME TABLE[4]\r\n\r\n  COSMIC TIME\r\n\r\n    FORMATIVE ERA.

Today the\r\nwarmest parts of the ocean have an average temperature of about 30 deg.C. on\r\nthe surface. Only a few forms of life live where the average temperature\r\nis much higher than this. In deserts, to be sure, some highly organized\r\nplants and animals can for a short time endure a temperature as high as\r\n75 deg.C. (167 deg.F.). In certain hot springs, some of the lowest unicellular\r\nplant forms exist in water which is only a little below the boiling\r\npoint. More complex forms, however, such as sponges, worms, and all the\r\nhigher plants and animals, seem to be unable to live either in water or\r\nair where the temperature averages above 45 deg.C. (113 deg.F.) for any great\r\nlength of time and it is doubtful whether they can thrive permanently\r\neven at that temperature. The obvious unity of life for hundreds of\r\nmillions of years and its presence at all times in middle latitudes so\r\nfar as we can tell seem to indicate that since the beginning of marine\r\nlife the temperature of the oceans cannot have averaged much above 50 deg.C.\r\neven in the warmest portions. This is putting the limit too high rather\r\nthan too low, but even so the warmest parts of the earth can scarcely\r\nhave averaged much more than 20 deg. warmer than at present.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other extreme, we may inquire how much colder than now\r\nthe earth's surface may have been since life first appeared. Proterozoic\r\nfossils have been found in places where the present average temperature\r\napproaches 0 deg.C. If those places should be colder than now by 30 deg.C., or\r\nmore, the drop in temperature at the equator would almost certainly be\r\nstill greater, and the seas everywhere would be permanently frozen. Thus\r\nlife would be impossible. Since the contrasts between summer and winter,\r\nand between the poles and the equator seem generally to have been less\r\nin the past than at present, the range through which the mean\r\ntemperature of the earth as a whole could vary without utterly\r\ndestroying life was apparently less than would now be the case.\r\n\r\nThese considerations make it fairly certain that for at least several\r\nhundred million years the average temperature of the earth's surface has\r\nnever varied more than perhaps 30 deg.C. above or below the present level.\r\nEven this range of 60 deg.C. (108 deg.F.) may be double or triple the range that\r\nhas actually occurred. That the temperature has not passed beyond\r\ncertain narrow limits, whatever their exact degree, is clear from the\r\nfact that if it had done so, all the higher forms of life would have\r\nbeen destroyed. Certain of the lowest unicellular forms might indeed\r\nhave persisted, for when dormant they can stand great extremes of dry\r\nheat and of cold for a long time. Even so, evolution would have had to\r\nbegin almost anew. The supposition that such a thing has happened is\r\nuntenable, for there is no hint of any complete break in the record of\r\nlife during geological times,--no sudden disappearance of the higher\r\norganisms followed by a long period with no signs of life other than\r\nindirect evidence such as occurs in the Archeozoic.\r\n\r\nA change of 60 deg.C. or even of 20 deg. in the average temperature of the\r\nearth's surface may seem large when viewed from the limited standpoint\r\nof terrestrial experience. Viewed, however, from the standpoint of\r\ncosmic evolution, or even of the solar system, it seems a mere trifle.\r\nConsider the possibilities. The temperature of empty space is the\r\nabsolute zero, or -273 deg.C. To this temperature all matter must fall,\r\nprovided it exists long enough and is not appreciably heated by\r\ncollisions or by radiation. At the other extreme lies the temperature of\r\nthe stars. As stars go, our sun is only moderately hot, but the\r\ntemperature of its surface is calculated to be nearly 7000 deg.C., while\r\nthousands of miles in the interior it may rise to 20,000 deg. or 100,000 deg. or\r\nsome other equally unknowable and incomprehensible figure. Between the\r\nlimits of the absolute zero on the one hand, and the interior of a sun\r\nor star on the other, there is almost every conceivable possibility of\r\ntemperature. Today the earth's surface averages not far from 14 deg.C., or\r\n287 deg. above the absolute zero. Toward the interior, the temperature in\r\nmines and deep wells rises about 1 deg.C. for every 100 meters. At this rate\r\nit would be over 500 deg.C. at a depth of ten miles, and over 5000 deg. at 100\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nLet us confine ourselves to surface temperatures, which are all that\r\nconcern us in discussing climate. It has been calculated by Poynting[5]\r\nthat if a small sphere absorbed and re-radiated all the heat that fell\r\nupon it, its temperature at the distance of Mercury from the sun would\r\naverage about 210 deg.C.; at the distance of Venus, 85 deg.; the earth 27 deg.; Mars\r\n-30 deg.; Neptune -219 deg.. A planet much nearer the sun than is Mercury might\r\nbe heated to a temperature of a thousand, or even several thousand,\r\ndegrees, while one beyond Neptune would remain almost at absolute zero.\r\nIt is well within the range of possibility that the temperature of a\r\nplanet's surface should be anywhere from near -273 deg.C. up to perhaps\r\n5000 deg.C. or more, although the probability of low temperature is much\r\ngreater than of high. Thus throughout the whole vast range of\r\npossibilities extending to perhaps 10,000 deg., the earth claims only 60 deg. at\r\nmost, or less than 1 per cent. This may be remarkable, but what is far\r\nmore remarkable is that the earth's range of 60 deg. includes what seem to\r\nbe the two most critical of all possible temperatures, namely, the\r\nfreezing point of water, 0 deg.C., and the temperature where water can\r\ndissolve an amount of carbon dioxide equal to its own volume. The most\r\nremarkable fact of all is that the earth has preserved its temperature\r\nwithin these narrow limits for a hundred million years, or perchance a\r\nthousand million.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the extraordinary significance of this last fact, it is\r\nnecessary to realize how extremely critical are the temperatures from\r\nabout 0 deg. to 40 deg.C., and how difficult it is to find any good reason for a\r\nrelatively uniform temperature through hundreds of millions of years.\r\nSince the dawn of geological time the earth's temperature has apparently\r\nalways included the range from about the freezing point of water up to\r\nabout the point where protoplasm begins to disintegrate. Henderson, in\r\n_The Fitness of the Environment_, rightly says that water is \"the most\r\nfamiliar and the most important of all things.\" In many respects water\r\nand carbon dioxide form the most unique pair of substances in the whole\r\nrealm of chemistry. Water has a greater tendency than any other known\r\nsubstance to remain within certain narrowly defined limits of\r\ntemperature. Not only does it have a high specific heat, so that much\r\nheat is needed to raise its temperature, but on freezing it gives up\r\nmore heat than any substance except ammonia, while none of the common\r\nliquids approach it in the amount of additional heat required for\r\nconversion into vapor after the temperature of vaporization has been\r\nreached. Again, water substance, as the physicists call all forms of\r\nH_{2}O, is unique in that it not only contracts on melting, but\r\ncontinues to contract until a temperature several degrees above its\r\nmelting point is reached. That fact has a vast importance in helping to\r\nkeep the earth's surface at a uniform temperature. If water were like\r\nmost liquids, the bottoms of all the oceans and even the entire body of\r\nwater in most cases would be permanently frozen.\r\n\r\nAgain, as a solvent there is literally nothing to compare with water. As\r\nHenderson[6] puts it: \"Nearly the whole science of chemistry has been\r\nbuilt up around water and aqueous solution.\" One of the most significant\r\nevidences of this is the variety of elements whose presence can be\r\ndetected in sea water. According to Henderson they include hydrogen,\r\noxygen, nitrogen, carbon, chlorine, sodium, magnesium, sulphur,\r\nphosphorus, which are easily detected; and also arsenic, caesium, gold,\r\nlithium, rubidium, barium, lead, boron, fluorine, iron, iodine, bromine,\r\npotassium, cobalt, copper, manganese, nickel, silver, silicon, zinc,\r\naluminium, calcium, and strontium. Yet in spite of its marvelous power\r\nof solution, water is chemically rather inert and relatively stable. It\r\ndissolves all these elements and thousands of their compounds, but still\r\nremains water and can easily be separated and purified. Another unique\r\nproperty of water is its power of ionizing dissolved substances, a\r\nproperty which makes it possible to produce electric currents in\r\nbatteries. This leads to an almost infinite array of electro-chemical\r\nreactions which play an almost dominant role in the processes of life.\r\nFinally, no common liquid except mercury equals water in its power of\r\ncapillarity. This fact is of enormous moment in biology, most obviously\r\nin respect to the soil.\r\n\r\nAlthough carbon dioxide is far less familiar than water, it is almost as\r\nimportant. \"These two simple substances,\" says Henderson, \"are the\r\ncommon source of every one of the complicated substances which are\r\nproduced by living beings, and they are the common end products of the\r\nwearing away of all the constituents of protoplasm, and of the\r\ndestruction of those materials which yield energy to the body.\" One of\r\nthe remarkable physical properties of carbon dioxide is its degree of\r\nsolubility in water. This quality varies enormously in different\r\nsubstances. For example, at ordinary pressures and temperatures, water\r\ncan absorb only about 5 per cent of its own volume of oxygen, while it\r\ncan take up about 1300 times its own volume of ammonia. Now for carbon\r\ndioxide, unlike most gases, the volume that can be absorbed by water is\r\nnearly the same as the volume of the water. The volumes vary, however,\r\naccording to temperature, being absolutely the same at a temperature of\r\nabout 15 deg.C. or 59 deg.F., which is close to the ideal temperature for man's\r\nphysical health and practically the same as the mean temperature of the\r\nearth's surface when all seasons are averaged together. \"Hence, when\r\nwater is in contact with air, and equilibrium has been established, the\r\namount of free carbonic acid in a given volume of water is almost\r\nexactly equal to the amount in the adjacent air. Unlike oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, and nitrogen, carbonic acid enters water freely; unlike\r\nsulphurous oxide and ammonia, it escapes freely from water. Thus the\r\nwaters can never wash carbonic acid completely out of the air, nor can\r\nthe air keep it from the waters. It is the one substance which thus, in\r\nconsiderable quantities relative to its total amount, everywhere\r\naccompanies water. In earth, air, fire, and water alike these two\r\nsubstances are always associated.\r\n\r\n\"Accordingly, if water be the first primary constituent of the\r\nenvironment, carbonic acid is inevitably the second,--because of its\r\nsolubility possessing an equal mobility with water, because of the\r\nreservoir of the atmosphere never to be depleted by chemical action in\r\nthe oceans, lakes, and streams. In truth, so close is the association\r\nbetween these two substances that it is scarcely correct logically to\r\nseparate them at all; together they make up the real environment and\r\nthey never part company.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe complementary qualities of carbon dioxide and water are of supreme\r\nimportance because these two are the only known substances which are\r\nable to form a vast series of complex compounds with highly varying\r\nchemical formulae. No other known compounds can give off or take on atoms\r\nwithout being resolved back into their elements. No others can thus\r\nchange their form freely without losing their identity. This power of\r\nchange without destruction is the fundamental chemical characteristic of\r\nlife, for life demands complexity, change, and growth.\r\n\r\nIn order that water and carbon dioxide may combine to form the compounds\r\non which life is based, the water must be in the liquid form, it must be\r\nable to dissolve carbon dioxide freely, and the temperature must not be\r\nhigh enough to break up the highly complex and delicate compounds as\r\nsoon as they are formed. In other words, the temperature must be above\r\nfreezing, while it must not rise higher than some rather indefinite\r\npoint between 50 deg.C. and the boiling point, where all water finally turns\r\ninto vapor. In the whole range of temperature, so far as we know, there\r\nis no other interval where any such complex reactions take place. The\r\ntemperature of the earth for hundreds of millions of years has remained\r\nfirmly fixed within these limits.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing quality of the earth's uniformity of temperature becomes\r\nstill more apparent when we consider the origin of the sun's heat. What\r\nthat origin is still remains a question of dispute. The old ideas of a\r\nburning sun, or of one that is simply losing an original supply of heat\r\nderived from some accident, such as collision with another body, were\r\nlong ago abandoned. The impact of a constant supply of meteors affords\r\nan almost equally unsatisfactory explanation. Moulton[8] states that if\r\nthe sun were struck by enough meteorites to keep up its heat, the earth\r\nwould almost certainly be struck by enough so that it would receive\r\nabout half of 1 per cent as much heat from them as from the sun. This is\r\nmillions of times more heat than is now received from meteors. If the\r\nsun owes its heat to the impact of larger bodies at longer intervals,\r\nthe geological record should show a series of interruptions far more\r\ndrastic than is actually the case.\r\n\r\nIt has also been supposed that the sun owes its heat to contraction. If\r\na gaseous body contracts it becomes warmer. Finally, however, it must\r\nbecome so dense that its rate of contraction diminishes and the process\r\nceases. Under the sun's present condition of size and density a radial\r\ncontraction of 120 feet per year would be enough to supply all the\r\nenergy now radiated by that body. This seems like a hopeful source of\r\nenergy, but Kelvin calculated that twenty million years ago it was\r\nineffective and ten million years hence it will be equally so. Moreover,\r\nif this is the source of heat, the amount of radiation from the sun\r\nwould have to vary enormously. Twenty million years ago the sun would\r\nhave extended nearly to the earth's orbit and would have been so tenuous\r\nthat it would have emitted no more heat than some of the nebulae in\r\nspace. Some millions of years later, when the sun's radius was twice as\r\ngreat as at present, that body would have emitted only one-fourth as\r\nmuch heat as now, which would mean that on the earth's surface the\r\ntheoretical temperature would have been 200 deg. below the present level.\r\nThis is utterly out of accord with the uniformity of climate shown by\r\nthe geological record. In the future, if the sun's contraction is the\r\nonly source of heat, the sun can supply the present amount for only ten\r\nmillion years, which would mean a change utterly unlike anything of\r\nwhich the geological record holds even the faintest hint.[9]\r\n\r\nAltogether the problem of how the sun can have remained so uniform and\r\nhow the earth's atmosphere and other conditions can also have remained\r\nso uniform throughout hundreds of millions of years is one of the most\r\npuzzling in the whole realm of nature. If appeal is taken to\r\nradioactivity and the breaking up of uranium into radium and helium,\r\nconditions can be postulated which will give the required amount of\r\nenergy. Such is also the case if it be supposed that there is some\r\nunknown process which may induce an atomic change like radioactivity in\r\nbodies which are now supposed to be stable elements. In either case,\r\nhowever, there is as yet no satisfactory explanation of the _uniformity_\r\nof the earth's climate. A hundred million or a thousand million years\r\nago the temperature of the earth's surface was very much the same as\r\nnow. The earth had then presumably ceased to emit any great amount of\r\nheat, if we may judge from the fact that its surface was cool enough so\r\nthat great ice sheets could accumulate on low lands within 40 deg. of the\r\nequator. The atmosphere was apparently almost like that of today, and\r\nwas almost certainly not different enough to make up for any great\r\ndivergence of the sun from its present condition. We cannot escape the\r\nstupendous fact that in those remote times the sun must have been\r\nessentially the same as now, or else that some utterly unknown factor is\r\nat work.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: W.

This variability is made up partly of a long, slow tendency\r\nin one direction and partly of innumerable cycles of every conceivable\r\nduration from days, or even hours, up to millions of years. Perhaps the\r\neasiest way to grasp the full complexity of the matter is to put the\r\nchief types of climatic sequence in the form of a table.\r\n\r\n   +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n   |                                                           |\r\n   |                            TABLE 2                        |\r\n   |                                                           |\r\n   |                   TYPES OF CLIMATIC SEQUENCE              |\r\n   |                                                           |\r\n   |  1.

Not even the rich\r\nEnglish language of the twentieth century, however, furnishes words with\r\nenough shades of meaning to express all that is desired. Moreover,\r\nexcept in degree, there is no sharp distinction between some of the\r\nrelated types, such as glacial fluctuations and historic pulsations.\r\nYet, taken as a whole, the table brings out the great contrast between\r\ntwo absolutely diverse extremes. At the one end lies well-nigh eternal\r\nuniformity, or an extremely slow progress in one direction throughout\r\ncountless ages; at the other, rapid and regular vibrations from day to\r\nday, or else irregular and seemingly unsystematic vacillations due to\r\ncyclonic storms, both of which types are repeated millions of times\r\nduring even a single glacial fluctuation.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of cosmic uniformity has been explained in the preceding\r\nchapter. Its relation to the other types of climatic sequences seems to\r\nbe that it sets sharply defined limits beyond which no changes of any\r\nkind have ever gone since life, as we know it, first began. Secular\r\nprogression, on the other hand, means that in spite of all manner of\r\nvariations, now this way and then the other, the normal climate of the\r\nearth, if there is such a thing, has on the whole probably changed a\r\nlittle, perhaps becoming more complex. After each period of continental\r\nuplift and glaciation--for such are preeminently the times of\r\ncomplexity--it is doubtful whether the earth has ever returned to quite\r\nits former degree of monotony. Today the earth has swung away from the\r\ngreat diversity of the glacial period. Yet we still have contrasts of\r\nwhat seem to us great magnitude. In low depressions, such as Turfan in\r\nthe central deserts of Eurasia, the thermometer sometimes ranges from\r\n0 deg.F. in the morning to 60 deg. in the shade at noon. On a cloudy day in the\r\nAmazon forest close to the seashore, on the contrary, the temperature\r\nfor months may rise to 85 deg. by day and sink no lower than 75 deg. at night.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the secular progression of the earth's climate appear to\r\nbe intimately connected with those which have caused the next, and, in\r\nmany respects, more important type of climatic sequence, which consists\r\nof geological oscillations. Both the progression and the oscillations\r\nseem to depend largely on three purely terrestrial factors: first, the\r\ncondition of the earth's interior, including both internal heat and\r\ncontraction; second, the salinity and movement of the ocean; and third,\r\nthe composition and amount of the atmosphere. To begin with the earth's\r\ninterior--its loss of heat appears to be an almost negligible factor in\r\nexplaining either secular progression or geologic oscillation. According\r\nto both the nebular and the planetesimal hypotheses, the earth's crust\r\nappears to be colder now than it was hundreds or thousands of millions\r\nof years ago. The emission of internal heat, however, had probably\r\nceased to be of much climatic significance near the beginning of the\r\ngeological record, for in southern Canada glaciation occurred very early\r\nin the Proterozoic era. On the other hand, the contraction of the earth\r\nhas produced remarkable effects throughout the whole of geological time.\r\nIt has lessened the earth's circumference by a thousand miles or more,\r\nas appears from the way in which the rocks have been folded and thrust\r\nbodily over one another. According to the laws of dynamics this must\r\nhave increased the speed of the earth's rotation, thus shortening the\r\nday, and also having the more important effect of increasing the bulge\r\nat the equator. On the other hand, recent investigations indicate that\r\ntidal retardation has probably diminished the earth's rate of rotation\r\nmore than seemed probable a few years ago, thus lengthening the day and\r\ndiminishing the bulge at the equator. Thus two opposing forces have been\r\nat work, one causing acceleration and one retardation. Their combined\r\neffect may have been a factor in causing secular progression of climate.\r\nIt almost certainly was of much importance in causing pronounced\r\noscillations first one way and then the other. This matter, together\r\nwith most of those touched in these first chapters, will be expanded in\r\nlater parts of the book. On the whole the tendency appears to have been\r\nto create climatic diversity in place of uniformity.\r\n\r\nThe increasing salinity of the oceans may have been another factor in\r\nproducing secular progression, although of slight importance in respect\r\nto oscillations. While the oceans were still growing in volume, it is\r\ngenerally assumed that they must have been almost fresh for a vast\r\nperiod, although Chamberlin thinks that the change in salinity has been\r\nmuch less than is usually supposed. So far as the early oceans were\r\nfresher than those of today, their deep-sea circulation must have been\r\nless hampered than now by the heavy saline water which is produced by\r\nevaporation in warm regions. Although this saline water is warm, its\r\nweight causes it to descend, instead of moving poleward in a surface\r\ncurrent; this descent slows up the rise of the cold water which has\r\nmoved along in the depths of the ocean from high latitudes, and thus\r\nchecks the general oceanic circulation. If the ancient oceans were\r\nfresher and hence had a freer circulation than now, a more rapid\r\ninterchange of polar and equatorial water presumably tended to equalize\r\nthe climate of all latitudes.\r\n\r\nAgain, although the earth's atmosphere has probably changed far less\r\nduring geological times than was formerly supposed, its composition has\r\ndoubtless varied. The total volume of nitrogen has probably increased,\r\nfor that gas is so inert that when it once becomes a part of the air it\r\nis almost sure to stay there. On the other hand, the proportions of\r\noxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor must have fluctuated. Oxygen is\r\ntaken out constantly by animals and by all the processes of rock\r\nweathering, but on the other hand the supply is increased when plants\r\nbreak up new carbon dioxide derived from volcanoes. As for the carbon\r\ndioxide, it appears probable that in spite of the increased supply\r\nfurnished by volcanoes the great amounts of carbon which have gradually\r\nbeen locked up in coal and limestone have appreciably depleted the\r\natmosphere. Water vapor also may be less abundant now than in the past,\r\nfor the presence of carbon dioxide raises the temperature a little and\r\nthereby enables the air to hold more moisture. When the area of the\r\noceans has diminished, and this has recurred very often, this likewise\r\nwould tend to reduce the water vapor. Moreover, even a very slight\r\ndiminution in the amount of heat given off by the earth, or a decrease\r\nin evaporation because of higher salinity in the oceans, would tend in\r\nthe same direction. Now carbon dioxide and water vapor both have a\r\nstrong blanketing effect whereby heat is prevented from leaving the\r\nearth. Therefore, the probable reduction in the carbon dioxide and water\r\nvapor of the earth's atmosphere has apparently tended to reduce the\r\nclimatic monotony and create diversity and complexity. Hence, in spite\r\nof many reversals, the general tendency of changes, not only in the\r\nearth's interior and in the oceans, but also in the atmosphere, appears\r\nto be a secular progression from a relatively monotonous climate in\r\nwhich the evolution of higher organic forms would scarcely be rapid to\r\nan extremely diverse and complex climate highly favorable to progressive\r\nevolution. The importance of these purely terrestrial agencies must not\r\nbe lost sight of when we come to discuss other agencies outside the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIn Table 2 the next type of climatic sequence is geologic oscillation.\r\nThis means slow swings that last millions of years. At one extreme of\r\nsuch an oscillation the climate all over the world is relatively\r\nmonotonous; it returns, as it were, toward the primeval conditions at\r\nthe beginning of the secular progression. At such times magnolias,\r\nsequoias, figs, tree ferns, and many other types of subtropical plants\r\ngrew far north in places like Greenland, as is well known from their\r\nfossil remains of middle Cenozoic time, for example. At these same\r\ntimes, and also at many others before such high types of plants had\r\nevolved, reef-making corals throve in great abundance in seas which\r\ncovered what is now Wisconsin, Michigan, Ontario, and other equally cool\r\nregions. Today these regions have an average temperature of only about\r\n70 deg.F. in the warmest month, and average well below freezing in winter.\r\nNo reef-making corals can now live where the temperature averages below\r\n68 deg.F. The resemblance of the ancient corals to those of today makes it\r\nhighly probable that they were equally sensitive to low temperature.\r\nThus, in the mild portions of a geologic oscillation the climate seems\r\nto have been so equable and uniform that many plants and animals could\r\nlive 1500 and at other times even 4000 miles farther from the equator\r\nthan now.\r\n\r\nAt such times the lands in middle and high latitudes were low and small,\r\nand the oceans extended widely over the continental platforms. Thus\r\nunhampered ocean currents had an opportunity to carry the heat of low\r\nlatitudes far toward the poles. Under such conditions, especially if the\r\nconception of the great subequatorial continent of Gondwana land is\r\ncorrect, the trade winds and the westerlies must have been stronger and\r\nsteadier than now. This would not only enable the westerlies, which are\r\nreally southwesterlies, to carry more heat than now to high latitudes,\r\nbut would still further strengthen the ocean currents. At the same time,\r\nthe air presumably contained an abundance of water vapor derived from\r\nthe broad oceans, and an abundance of atmospheric carbon dioxide\r\ninherited from a preceding time when volcanoes contributed much carbon\r\ndioxide to the air. These two constituents of the atmosphere may have\r\nexercised a pronounced blanketing effect whereby the heat of the earth\r\nwith its long wave lengths was kept in, although the energy of the sun\r\nwith its shorter wave lengths was not markedly kept out. Thus everything\r\nmay have combined to produce mild conditions in high latitudes, and to\r\ndiminish the contrast between equator and pole, and between summer and\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions perhaps carry in themselves the seeds of decay. At any\r\nrate while the lands lie quiet during a period of mild climate great\r\nstrains must accumulate in the crust because of the earth's contraction\r\nand tidal retardation. At the same time the great abundance of plants\r\nupon the lowlying plains with their mild climates, and the marine\r\ncreatures upon the broad continental platforms, deplete the atmospheric\r\ncarbon dioxide. Part of this is locked up as coal and part as limestone\r\nderived from marine plants as well as animals. Then something happens so\r\nthat the strains and stresses of the crust are released. The sea floors\r\nsink; the continents become relatively high and large; mountain ranges\r\nare formed; and the former plains and emergent portions of the\r\ncontinental platforms are eroded into hills and valleys. The large size\r\nof the continents tends to create deserts and other types of climatic\r\ndiversity; the presence of mountain ranges checks the free flow of winds\r\nand also creates diversity; the ocean currents are likewise checked,\r\naltered, and diverted so that the flow of heat from low to high\r\nlatitudes is diminished. At the same time evaporation from the ocean\r\ndiminishes so that a decrease in water vapor combines with the previous\r\ndepletion of carbon dioxide to reduce the blanketing effect of the\r\natmosphere. Thus upon periods of mild monotony there supervene periods\r\nof complexity, diversity, and severity. Turn to Table 1 and see how a\r\nglacial climate again and again succeeds a time when relative mildness\r\nprevailed almost everywhere. Or examine Fig. 1 and notice how the lines\r\nrepresenting temperatures go up and down. In the figure Schuchert makes\r\nit clear that when the lands have been large and mountain-making has\r\nbeen important, as shown by the high parts of the lower shaded area, the\r\nclimate has been severe, as shown by the descent of the snow line, the\r\nupper shaded area. In the diagram the climatic oscillations appear\r\nshort, but this is merely because they have been crowded together,\r\nespecially in the left hand or early part. There an inch in length may\r\nrepresent a hundred million years. Even at the right-hand end an inch is\r\nequivalent to several million years.\r\n\r\nThe severe part of a climatic oscillation, as well as the mild part,\r\nwill be shown in later chapters to bear in itself certain probable seeds\r\nof decay. While the lands are being uplifted, volcanic activity is\r\nlikely to be vigorous and to add carbon dioxide to the air. Later, as\r\nthe mountains are worn down by the many agencies of water, wind, ice,\r\nand chemical decay, although much carbon dioxide is locked up by the\r\ncarbonation of the rocks, the carbon locked up in the coal is set free\r\nand increases the carbon dioxide of the air. At the same time the\r\ncontinents settle slowly downward, for the earth's crust though rigid as\r\nsteel is nevertheless slightly viscous and will flow if subjected to\r\nsufficiently great and enduring pressure. The area from which\r\nevaporation can take place is thereby increased because of the spread of\r\nthe oceans over the continents, and water vapor joins with the carbon\r\ndioxide to blanket the earth and thus tends to keep it uniformly warm.\r\nMoreover, the diminution of the lands frees the ocean currents from\r\nrestraint and permits them to flow more freely from low latitudes to\r\nhigh. Thus in the course of millions of years there is a return toward\r\nmonotony. Ultimately, however, new stresses accumulate in the earth's\r\ncrust, and the way is prepared for another great oscillation. Perhaps\r\nthe setting free of the stresses takes place simply because the strain\r\nat last becomes irresistible. It is also possible, as we shall see, that\r\nan external agency sometimes adds to the strain and thereby determines\r\nthe time at which a new oscillation shall begin.\r\n\r\nIn Table 2 the types of climatic sequences which follow \"geologic\r\noscillations\" are \"glacial fluctuations,\" \"orbital precessions\" and\r\n\"historical pulsations.\" Glacial fluctuations and historical pulsations\r\nappear to be of the same type, except as to severity and duration, and\r\nhence may be considered together. They will be treated briefly here\r\nbecause the theories as to their causes are outlined in the next two\r\nchapters. Oddly enough, although the historic pulsations lie much closer\r\nto us than do the glacial fluctuations, they were not discovered until\r\ntwo or three generations later, and are still much less known. The most\r\nimportant feature of both sequences is the swing from a glacial to an\r\ninter-glacial epoch or from the arsis or accentuated part of an\r\nhistorical pulsation to the thesis or unaccented part. In a glacial\r\nepoch or in the arsis of an historic pulsation, storms are usually\r\nabundant and severe, the mean temperature is lower than usual, snow\r\naccumulates in high latitudes or upon lofty mountains. For example, in\r\nthe last such period during the fourteenth century, great floods and\r\ndroughts occurred alternately around the North Sea; it was several times\r\npossible to cross the Baltic Sea from Germany to Sweden on the ice, and\r\nthe ice of Greenland advanced so much that shore ice caused the Norsemen\r\nto change their sailing route between Iceland and the Norse colonies in\r\nsouthern Greenland. At the same time in low latitudes and in parts of\r\nthe continental interior there is a tendency toward diminished rainfall\r\nand even toward aridity and the formation of deserts. In Yucatan, for\r\nexample, a diminution in tropical rainfall in the fourteenth century\r\nseems to have given the Mayas a last opportunity for a revival of their\r\ndecaying civilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1. Climatic changes and mountain building._\r\n\r\n(_After Schuchert, in The Evolution of the Earth and Its Inhabitants,\r\nedited by R. S. Lull._) Diagram showing the times and probable extent of\r\nthe more or less marked climate changes in the geologic history of North\r\nAmerica, and of its elevation into chains of mountains.]\r\n\r\nAmong the climatic sequences, glacial fluctuations are perhaps of the\r\nmost vital import from the standpoint of organic evolution; from the\r\nstandpoint of human history the same is true of climatic pulsations.\r\nGlacial epochs have repeatedly wiped out thousands upon thousands of\r\nspecies and played a part in the origin of entirely new types of plants\r\nand animals. This is best seen when the life of the Pennsylvanian is\r\ncontrasted with that of the Permian. An historic pulsation may wipe out\r\nan entire civilization and permit a new one to grow up with a radically\r\ndifferent character. Hence it is not strange that the causes of such\r\nclimatic phenomena have been discussed with extraordinary vigor. In few\r\nrealms of science has there been a more imposing or more interesting\r\narray of theories. In this book we shall consider the more important of\r\nthese theories. A new solar or cyclonic hypothesis and the hypothesis of\r\nchanges in the form and altitude of the land will receive the most\r\nattention, but the other chief hypotheses are outlined in the next\r\nchapter, and are frequently referred to throughout the volume.\r\n\r\nBetween glacial fluctuations and historical pulsations in duration, but\r\nprobably less severe than either, come orbital precessions. These stand\r\nin a group by themselves and are more akin to seasonal alternations than\r\nto any other type of climatic sequence. They must have occurred with\r\nabsolute regularity ever since the earth began to revolve around the sun\r\nin its present elliptical orbit. Since the orbit is elliptical and since\r\nthe sun is in one of the two foci of the ellipse, the earth's distance\r\nfrom the sun varies. At present the earth is nearest the sun in the\r\nnorthern winter. Hence the rigor of winter in the northern hemisphere is\r\nmitigated, while that of the southern hemisphere is increased. In about\r\nten thousand years this condition will be reversed, and in another ten\r\nthousand the present conditions will return once more. Such climatic\r\nprecessions, as we may here call them, must have occurred unnumbered\r\ntimes in the past, but they do not appear to have been large enough to\r\nleave in the fossils of the rocks any traces that can be distinguished\r\nfrom those of other climatic sequences.\r\n\r\nWe come now to Brueckner periods and sunspot cycles. The Brueckner periods\r\nhave a length of about thirty-three years. Their existence was suggested\r\nat least as long ago as the days of Sir Francis Bacon, whose statement\r\nabout them is quoted on the flyleaf of this book. They have since been\r\ndetected by a careful study of the records of the time of harvest,\r\nvintage, the opening of rivers to navigation, and the rise or fall of\r\nlakes like the Caspian Sea. In his book on _Klimaschwankungen seit\r\n1700_, Brueckner has collected an uncommonly interesting assortment of\r\nfacts as to the climate of Europe for more than two centuries. More\r\nrecently, by a study of the rate of growth of trees, Douglass, in his\r\nbook on _Climatic Cycles and Tree Growth_, has carried the subject still\r\nfurther. In general the nature of the 33-year periods seems to be\r\nidentical with that of the 11- or 12- year sunspot cycle, on the one\r\nhand, and of historic pulsations on the other. For a century observers\r\nhave noted that the variations in the weather which everyone notices\r\nfrom year to year seem to have some relation to sunspots. For\r\ngenerations, however, the relationship was discussed without leading to\r\nany definite conclusion. The trouble was that the same change was\r\nsupposed to take place in all parts of the world. Hence, when every sort\r\nof change was found somewhere at any given sunspot stage, it seemed as\r\nthough there could not be a relationship. Of late years, however, the\r\nmatter has become fairly clear. The chief conclusions are, first, that\r\nwhen sunspots are numerous the average temperature of the earth's\r\nsurface is lower than normal. This does not mean that all parts are\r\ncooler, for while certain large areas grow cool, others of less extent\r\nbecome warm at times of many sunspots. Second, at times of many sunspots\r\nstorms are more abundant than usual, but are also confined somewhat\r\nclosely to certain limited tracks so that elsewhere a diminution of\r\nstorminess may be noted. This whole question is discussed so fully in\r\n_Earth and Sun_ that it need not detain us further in this preliminary\r\nview of the whole problem of climate. Suffice it to say that a study of\r\nthe sunspot cycle leads to the conclusion that it furnishes a clue to\r\nmany of the unsolved problems of the climate of the past, as well as a\r\nkey to prediction of the future.\r\n\r\nPassing by the seasonal alternations which are fully explained as the\r\nresult of the revolution of the earth around the sun, we may merely\r\npoint out that, like the daily vibrations which bring Table 2 to a\r\nclose, they emphasize the outstanding fact that the main control of\r\nterrestrial climate is the amount of energy received from the sun. This\r\nsame principle is illustrated by pleionian migrations. The term \"pleion\"\r\ncomes from a Greek word meaning \"more.\" It was taken by Arctowski to\r\ndesignate areas or periods where there is an excess of some climatic\r\nelement, such as atmospheric pressure, rainfall, or temperature. Even if\r\nthe effect of the seasons is eliminated, it appears that the course of\r\nthese various elements does not run smoothly. As everyone knows, a\r\nperiod like the autumn of 1920 in the eastern United States may be\r\nunusually warm, while a succeeding period may be unseasonably cool.\r\nThese departures from the normal show a certain rough periodicity. For\r\nexample, there is evidence of a period of about twenty-seven days,\r\ncorresponding to the sun's rotation and formerly supposed to be due to\r\nthe moon's revolution which occupies almost the same length of time.\r\nStill other periods appear to have an average duration of about three\r\nmonths and of between two and three years. Two remarkable discoveries\r\nhave recently been made in respect to such pleions. One is that a given\r\ntype of change usually occurs simultaneously in a number of well-defined\r\nbut widely separated centers, while a change of an opposite character\r\narises in another equally well-defined, but quite different, set of\r\ncenters. In general, areas of high pressure have one type of change and\r\nareas of low pressure the other type. So systematic are these\r\nrelationships and so completely do they harmonize in widely separated\r\nparts of the earth, that it seems certain that they must be due to some\r\noutside cause, which in all probability can be only the sun. The second\r\ndiscovery is that pleions, when once formed, travel irregularly along\r\nthe earth's surface. Their paths have not yet been worked out in detail,\r\nbut a general migration seems well established. Because of this, it is\r\nprobable that if unusually warm weather prevails in one part of a\r\ncontinent at a given time, the \"thermo-pleion,\" or excess of heat, will\r\nnot vanish but will gradually move away in some particular direction. If\r\nwe knew the path that it would follow we might predict the general\r\ntemperature along its course for some months in advance. The paths are\r\noften irregular, and the pleions frequently show a tendency to break up\r\nor suddenly revive. Probably this tendency is due to variations in the\r\nsun. When the sun is highly variable, the pleions are numerous and\r\nstrong, and extremes of weather are frequent. Taken as a whole the\r\npleions offer one of the most interesting and hopeful fields not only\r\nfor the student of the causes of climatic variations, but for the man\r\nwho is interested in the practical question of long-range weather\r\nforecasts. Like many other climatic phenomena they seem to represent the\r\ncombined effect of conditions in the sun and upon the earth itself.\r\n\r\nThe last of the climatic sequences which require explanation is the\r\ncyclonic vacillations. These are familiar to everyone, for they are the\r\nchanges of weather which occur at intervals of a few days, or a week or\r\ntwo, at all seasons, in large parts of the United States, Europe, Japan,\r\nand some of the other progressive parts of the earth. They do not,\r\nhowever, occur with great frequency in equatorial regions, deserts, and\r\nmany other regions. Up to the end of the last century, it was generally\r\nsupposed that cyclonic storms were purely terrestrial in origin. Without\r\nany adequate investigation it was assumed that all irregularities in the\r\nplanetary circulation of the winds arise from an irregular distribution\r\nof heat due to conditions within or upon the earth itself. These\r\nirregularities were supposed to produce cyclonic storms in certain\r\nlimited belts, but not in most parts of the world. Today this view is\r\nbeing rapidly modified. Undoubtedly, the irregularities due to purely\r\nterrestrial conditions are one of the chief contributory causes of\r\nstorms, but it begins to appear that solar variations also play a part.\r\nIt has been found, for example, that not only the mean temperature of\r\nthe earth's surface varies in harmony with the sunspot cycle, but that\r\nthe frequency and severity of storms vary in the same way. Moreover, it\r\nhas been demonstrated that the sun's radiation is not constant, but is\r\nsubject to innumerable variations. This does not mean that the sun's\r\ngeneral temperature varies, but merely that at some times heated gases\r\nare ejected rapidly to high levels so that a sudden wave of energy\r\nstrikes the earth. Thus, the present tendency is to believe that the\r\ncyclonic variations, the changes of weather which come and go in such a\r\nhaphazard, irresponsible way, are partly due to causes pertaining to the\r\nearth itself and partly to the sun.\r\n\r\nFrom this rapid survey of the types of climatic sequences, it is evident\r\nthat they may be divided into four great groups. First comes cosmic\r\nuniformity, one of the most marvelous and incomprehensible of all known\r\nfacts. We simply have no explanation which is in any respect adequate.\r\nNext come secular progression and geologic oscillations, two types of\r\nchange which seem to be due mainly to purely terrestrial causes, that\r\nis, to changes in the lands, the oceans, and the air. The general\r\ntendency of these changes is toward complexity and diversity, thus\r\nproducing progression, but they are subject to frequent reversals which\r\ngive rise to oscillations lasting millions of years. The processes by\r\nwhich the oscillations take place are fully discussed in this book.\r\nNevertheless, because they are fairly well understood, they are deferred\r\nuntil after the third group of sequences has been discussed. This group\r\nincludes glacial fluctuations, historic pulsations, Brueckner periods,\r\nsunspot cycles, pleionian migrations, and cyclonic vacillations. The\r\noutstanding fact in regard to all of these is that while they are\r\ngreatly modified by purely terrestrial conditions, they seem to owe\r\ntheir origin to variations in the sun. They form the chief subject of\r\n_Earth and Sun_ and in their larger phases are the most important topic\r\nof this book also. The last group of sequences includes orbital\r\nprecessions, seasonal alternations, and daily variations. These may be\r\nregarded as purely solar in origin. Yet their influence, like that of\r\neach of the other groups, is much modified by the earth's own\r\nconditions. Our main problem is to separate and explain the two great\r\nelements in climatic changes,--the effects of the sun, on the one hand,\r\nand of the earth on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHYPOTHESES OF CLIMATIC CHANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next step in our study of climate is to review the main hypotheses\r\nas to the causes of glaciation. These hypotheses apply also to other\r\ntypes of climatic changes. We shall concentrate on glacial periods,\r\nhowever, not only because they are the most dramatic and well-known\r\ntypes of change, but because they have been more discussed than any\r\nother and have also had great influence on evolution. Moreover, they\r\nstand near the middle of the types of climatic sequences, and an\r\nunderstanding of them does much to explain the others. In reviewing the\r\nvarious theories we shall not attempt to cover all the ground, but shall\r\nmerely state the main ideas of the few theories which have had an\r\nimportant influence upon scientific thought.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which any satisfactory climatic hypothesis must satisfy\r\nare briefly as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Due weight must be given to the fact that changes of climate are\r\nalmost certainly due to the combined effect of a variety of causes, both\r\nterrestrial and solar or cosmic.\r\n\r\n(2) Attention must also be paid to both sides in the long controversy as\r\nto whether glaciation is due primarily to a diminution in the earth's\r\nsupply of heat or to a _redistribution_ of the heat through changes in\r\natmospheric and oceanic circulation. At present the great majority of\r\nauthorities are on the side of a diminution of heat, but the other view\r\nalso deserves study.\r\n\r\n(3) A satisfactory hypothesis must explain the frequent synchronism\r\nbetween two great types of phenomena; first, movements of the earth's\r\ncrust whereby continents are uplifted and mountains upheaved; and,\r\nsecond, great changes of climate which are usually marked by relatively\r\nrapid oscillations from one extreme to another.\r\n\r\n(4) No hypothesis can find acceptance unless it satisfies the somewhat\r\nexacting requirements of the geological record, with its frequent but\r\nirregular repetition of long, mild periods, relatively cool or\r\nintermediate periods like the present, and glacial periods of more or\r\nless severity and perhaps accompanying the more or less widespread\r\nuplifting of continents. At least during the later glacial periods the\r\nhypothesis must explain numerous climatic epochs and stages superposed\r\nupon a single general period of continental upheaval. Moreover, although\r\nhistorical geology demands cycles of varied duration and magnitude, it\r\ndoes not furnish evidence of any rigid periodicity causing the cycles to\r\nbe uniform in length or intensity.\r\n\r\n(5) Most important of all, a satisfactory explanation of climatic\r\nchanges and crustal deformation must take account of all the agencies\r\nwhich are now causing similar phenomena. Whether any other agencies\r\nshould be considered is open to question, although the relative\r\nimportance of existing agencies may have varied.\r\n\r\nI. _Croll's Eccentricity Theory._ One of the most ingenious and most\r\ncarefully elaborated scientific hypotheses is Croll's[10] precessional\r\nhypothesis as to the effect of the earth's own motions. So well was this\r\nworked out that it was widely accepted for a time and still finds a\r\nplace in popular but unscientific books, such as Wells' _Outline of\r\nHistory_, and even in scientific works like Wright's _Quaternary Ice\r\nAge_. The gist of the hypothesis has already been given in connection\r\nwith the type of climatic sequence known as orbital precessions. The\r\nearth is 93 million miles away from the sun in January and 97 million in\r\nJuly. The earth's axis \"precesses,\" however, just as does that of a\r\nspinning top. Hence arises what is known as the precession of the\r\nequinoxes, that is, a steady change in the season at which the earth is\r\nin perihelion, or nearest to the sun. In the course of 21,000 years the\r\ntime of perihelion varies from early in January through the entire\r\ntwelve months and back to January. Moreover, the earth's orbit is\r\nslightly more elliptical at certain periods than at others, for the\r\nplanets sometimes become bunched so that they all pull the earth in one\r\ndirection. Hence, once in about one hundred thousand years the effect of\r\nthe elliptical shape of the earth's orbit is at a maximum.\r\n\r\nCroll argued that these astronomical changes must alter the earth's\r\nclimate, especially by their effect on winds and ocean currents. His\r\nelaborate argument contains a vast amount of valuable material. Later\r\ninvestigation, however, seems to have proven the inadequacy of his\r\nhypothesis. In the first place, the supposed cause does not seem nearly\r\nsufficient to produce the observed results. Second, Croll's hypothesis\r\ndemands that glaciation in the northern and southern hemisphere take\r\nplace alternately. A constantly growing collection of facts, however,\r\nindicates that glaciation does not occur in the two hemispheres\r\nalternately, but at the same time. Third, the hypothesis calls for the\r\nconstant and frequent repetition of glaciation at absolutely regular\r\nintervals. The geological record shows no such regularity, for sometimes\r\nseveral glacial epochs follow in relatively close succession at\r\nirregular intervals of perhaps fifty to two hundred thousand years, and\r\nthus form a glacial period; and then for millions of years there are\r\nnone. Fourth, the eccentricity hypothesis provides no adequate\r\nexplanation for the glacial stages or subepochs, the historic\r\npulsations, and the other smaller climatic variations which are\r\nsuperposed upon glacial epochs and upon one another in bewildering\r\nconfusion. In spite of these objections, there can be little question\r\nthat the eccentricity of the earth's orbit and the precession of the\r\nequinoxes with the resulting change in the season of perihelion must\r\nhave some climatic effect. Hence Croll's theory deserves a permanent\r\nthough minor place in any full discussion of the causes of climatic\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nII. _The Carbon Dioxide Theory._ At about the time that the eccentricity\r\ntheory was being relegated to a minor niche, a new theory was being\r\ndeveloped which soon exerted a profound influence upon geological\r\nthought. Chamberlin,[11] adopting an idea suggested by Tyndall, fired\r\nthe imagination of geologists by his skillful exposition of the part\r\nplayed by carbon dioxide in causing climatic changes. Today this theory\r\nis probably more widely accepted than any other. We have already seen\r\nthat the amount of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere has a decided\r\nclimatic importance. Moreover, there can be little doubt that the amount\r\nof that gas in the atmosphere varies from age to age in response to the\r\nextent to which it is set free by volcanoes, consumed by plants,\r\ncombined with rocks in the process of weathering, dissolved in the ocean\r\nor locked up in the form of coal and limestone. The main question is\r\nwhether such variations can produce changes so rapid as glacial epochs\r\nand historical pulsations.\r\n\r\nAbundant evidence seems to show that the degree to which the air can be\r\nwarmed by carbon dioxide is sharply limited. Humphreys, in his excellent\r\nbook on the _Physics of the Air_, calculates that a layer of carbon\r\ndioxide forty centimeters thick has practically as much blanketing\r\neffect as a layer indefinitely thicker. In other words, forty\r\ncentimeters of carbon dioxide, while having no appreciable effect on\r\nsunlight coming toward the earth, would filter out and thus retain in\r\nthe atmosphere all the outgoing terrestrial heat that carbon dioxide is\r\ncapable of absorbing. Adding more would be like adding another filter\r\nwhen the one in operation has already done all that that particular kind\r\nof filter is capable of doing. According to Humphreys' calculations, a\r\ndoubling of the carbon dioxide in the air would in itself raise the\r\naverage temperature about 1.3 deg.C. and further carbon dioxide would have\r\npractically no effect. Reducing the present supply by half would reduce\r\nthe temperature by essentially the same amount.\r\n\r\nThe effect must be greater, however, than would appear from the figures\r\ngiven above, for any change in temperature has an effect on the amount\r\nof water vapor, which in turn causes further changes of temperature.\r\nMoreover, as Chamberlin points out, it is not clear whether Humphreys\r\nallows for the fact that when the 40 centimeters of CO_{2} nearest the\r\nearth has been heated by terrestrial radiation, it in turn radiates half\r\nits heat outward and half inward. The outward half is all absorbed in\r\nthe next layer of carbon dioxide, and so on. The process is much more\r\ncomplex than this, but the end result is that even the last increment of\r\nCO_{2}, that is, the outermost portions in the upper atmosphere, must\r\napparently absorb an infinitesimally small amount of heat. This fact,\r\nplus the effect of water vapor, would seem to indicate that a doubling\r\nor halving of the amount of CO_{2}, would have an effect of more than\r\n1.3 deg.C. A change of even 2 deg.C. above or below the present level of the\r\nearth's mean temperature would be of very appreciable climatic\r\nsignificance, for it is commonly believed that during the height of the\r\nglacial period the mean temperature was only 5 deg. to 8 deg.C. lower than now.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide do not\r\nnecessarily seem competent to produce the relatively rapid climatic\r\nfluctuations of glacial epochs and historic pulsations as distinguished\r\nfrom the longer swings of glacial periods and geological eras. In\r\nChamberlin's view, as in ours, the elevation of the land, the\r\nmodification of the currents of the air and of the ocean, and all that\r\ngoes with elevation as a topographic agency constitute a primary cause\r\nof climatic changes. A special effect of this is the removal of carbon\r\ndioxide from the air by the enhanced processes of weathering. This, as\r\nhe carefully states, is a very slow process, and cannot of itself lead\r\nto anything so sudden as the oncoming of glaciation. But here comes\r\nChamberlin's most distinctive contribution to the subject, namely, the\r\nhypothesis that changes in atmospheric temperature arising from\r\nvariations in atmospheric carbon dioxide are able to cause a reversal of\r\nthe deep-sea oceanic circulation.\r\n\r\nAccording to Chamberlin's view, the ordinary oceanic circulation of the\r\ngreater part of geological time was the reverse of the present\r\ncirculation. Warm water descended to the ocean depths in low latitudes,\r\nkept its heat while creeping slowly poleward, and rose in high latitudes\r\nproducing the warm climate which enabled corals, for example, to grow in\r\nhigh latitudes. Chamberlin holds this opinion largely because there\r\nseems to him to be no other reasonable way to account for the enormously\r\nlong warm periods when heat-loving forms of life lived in what are now\r\npolar regions of ice and snow. He explains this reversed circulation by\r\nsupposing that an abundance of atmospheric carbon dioxide, together with\r\na broad distribution of the oceans, made the atmosphere so warm that the\r\nevaporation in low latitudes was far more rapid than now. Hence the\r\nsurface water of the ocean became a relatively concentrated brine. Such\r\na brine is heavy and tends to sink, thereby setting up an oceanic\r\ncirculation the reverse of that which now prevails. At present the polar\r\nwaters sink because they are cold and hence contract. Moreover, when\r\nthey freeze a certain amount of salt leaves the ice and thereby\r\nincreases the salinity of the surrounding water. Thus the polar water\r\nsinks to the depths of the ocean, its place is taken by warmer and\r\nlighter water from low latitudes which moves poleward along the surface,\r\nand at the same time the cold water of the ocean depths is forced\r\nequatorward below the surface. But if the equatorial waters were so\r\nconcentrated that a steady supply of highly saline water kept descending\r\nto low levels, the direction of the circulation would have to be\r\nreversed. The time when this would occur would depend upon the delicate\r\nbalance between the downward tendencies of the cold polar water and of\r\nthe warm saline equatorial water.\r\n\r\nSuppose that while such a reversed circulation prevailed, the\r\natmospheric CO_{2} should be depleted, and the air cooled so much that\r\nthe concentration of the equatorial waters by evaporation was no longer\r\nsufficient to cause them to sink. A reversal would take place, the\r\npresent type of circulation would be inaugurated, and the whole earth\r\nwould suffer a chill because the surface of the ocean would become cool.\r\nThe cool surface-water would absorb carbon dioxide faster than the\r\nprevious warm water had done, for heat drives off gases from water. This\r\nwould hasten the cooling of the atmosphere still more, not only directly\r\nbut by diminishing the supply of atmospheric moisture. The result would\r\nbe glaciation. But ultimately the cold waters of the higher latitudes\r\nwould absorb all the carbon dioxide they could hold, the slow\r\nequatorward creep would at length permit the cold water to rise to the\r\nsurface in low latitudes. There the warmth of the equatorial sun and the\r\ndepleted supply of carbon dioxide in the air would combine to cause the\r\nwater to give up its carbon dioxide once more. If the atmosphere had\r\nbeen sufficiently depleted by that time, the rising waters in low\r\nlatitudes might give up more carbon dioxide than the cold polar waters\r\nabsorbed. Thus the atmospheric supply would increase, the air would\r\nagain grow warm, and a tendency toward deglaciation, or toward an\r\ninter-glacial condition would arise. At such times the oceanic\r\ncirculation is not supposed to have been reversed, but merely to have\r\nbeen checked and made slower by the increasing warmth. Thus\r\ninter-glacial conditions like those of today, or even considerably\r\nwarmer, are supposed to have been produced with the present type of\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nThe emission of carbon dioxide in low latitudes could not permanently\r\nexceed the absorption in high latitudes. After the present type of\r\ncirculation was finally established, which might take tens of thousands\r\nof years, the two would gradually become equal. Then the conditions\r\nwhich originally caused the oceanic circulation to be reversed would\r\nagain destroy the balance; the atmospheric carbon dioxide would be\r\ndepleted; the air would grow cooler; and the cycle of glaciation would\r\nbe repeated. Each cycle would be shorter than the last, for not only\r\nwould the swings diminish like those of a pendulum, but the agencies\r\nthat were causing the main depletion of the atmospheric carbon dioxide\r\nwould diminish in intensity. Finally as the lands became lower through\r\nerosion and submergence, and as the processes of weathering became\r\ncorrespondingly slow, the air would gradually be able to accumulate\r\ncarbon dioxide; the temperature would increase; and at length the\r\noceanic circulation would be reversed again. When the warm saline waters\r\nof low latitudes finally began to sink and to set up a flow of warm\r\nwater poleward in the depths of the ocean, a glacial period would\r\ndefinitely come to an end.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis has been so skillfully elaborated, and contains so many\r\nimportant elements that one can scarcely study it without profound\r\nadmiration. We believe that it is of the utmost value as a step toward\r\nthe truth, and especially because it emphasizes the great function of\r\noceanic circulation. Nevertheless, we are unable to accept it in full\r\nfor several reasons, which may here be stated very briefly. Most of them\r\nwill be discussed fully in later pages.\r\n\r\n(1) While a reversal of the deep-sea circulation would undoubtedly be of\r\ngreat climatic importance and would produce a warm climate in high\r\nlatitudes, we see no direct evidence of such a reversal. It is equally\r\ntrue that there is no conclusive evidence against it, and the\r\npossibility of a reversal must not be overlooked. There seem, however,\r\nto be other modifications of atmospheric and oceanic circulation which\r\nare able to produce the observed results.\r\n\r\n(2) There is much, and we believe conclusive, evidence that a mere\r\nlowering of temperature would not produce glaciation. What seems to be\r\nneeded is changes in atmospheric circulation and in precipitation. The\r\ncarbon dioxide hypothesis has not been nearly so fully developed on the\r\nmeteorological side as in other respects.\r\n\r\n(3) The carbon dioxide hypothesis seems to demand that the oceans should\r\nhave been almost as saline as now in the Proterozoic era at the time of\r\nthe first known glaciation. Chamberlin holds that such was the case, but\r\nthe constant supply of saline material brought to the ocean by rivers\r\nand the relatively small deposition of such material on the sea floor\r\nseem to indicate that the early oceans must have been much fresher than\r\nthose of today.\r\n\r\n(4) The carbon dioxide hypothesis does not attempt to explain minor\r\nclimatic fluctuations such as post-glacial stages and historic\r\npulsations, but these appear to be of the same nature as glacial epochs,\r\ndiffering only in degree.\r\n\r\n(5) Another reason for hesitation in accepting the carbon dioxide\r\nhypothesis as a full explanation of glacial fluctuations is the highly\r\ncomplex and non-observational character of the explanation of the\r\nalternation of glacial and inter-glacial epochs and of their constantly\r\ndecreasing length.\r\n\r\n(6) Most important of all, a study of the variations of weather and of\r\nclimate as they are disclosed by present records and by the historic\r\npast suggests that there are now in action certain other causes which\r\nare competent to explain glaciation without recourse to a process whose\r\naction is beyond the realm of observation.\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead to the conclusion that the carbon dioxide\r\nhypothesis and the reversal of the oceanic circulation should be\r\nregarded as a tentative rather than a final explanation of glaciation.\r\nNevertheless, the action of carbon dioxide seems to be an important\r\nfactor in producing the longer oscillations of climate from one\r\ngeological era to another. It probably plays a considerable part in\r\npreparing the way for glacial periods and in making it possible for\r\nother factors to produce the more rapid changes which have so deeply\r\ninfluenced organic evolution.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Form of the Land._ Another great cause of climatic change\r\nconsists of a group of connected phenomena dependent upon movements of\r\nthe earth's crust. As to the climatic potency of changes in the lands\r\nthere is practical agreement among students of climatology and\r\nglaciation. That the height and extent of the continents, the location,\r\nsize, and orientation of mountain ranges, and the opening and closing of\r\noceanic gateways at places like Panama, and the consequent diversion of\r\noceanic currents, exert a profound effect upon climate can scarcely be\r\nquestioned. Such changes may be introduced rapidly, but their\r\ndisappearance is usually slow compared with the rapid pulsations to\r\nwhich climate has been subject during historic times and during stages\r\nof glacial retreat and advance, or even in comparison with the epochs\r\ninto which the Pleistocene, Permian, and perhaps earlier glacial periods\r\nhave been divided. Hence, while crustal movements appear to be more\r\nimportant than the eccentricity of the earth's orbit or the amount of\r\ncarbon dioxide in the air, they do not satisfactorily explain glacial\r\nfluctuations, historic pulsations, and especially the present little\r\ncycles of climatic change. All these changes involve a relatively rapid\r\nswing from one extreme to another, while an upheaval of a continent,\r\nwhich is at best a slow geologic process, apparently cannot be undone\r\nfor a long, long time. Hence such an upheaval, if acting alone, would\r\nlead to a relatively long-lived climate of a somewhat extreme type. It\r\nwould help to explain the long swings, or geologic oscillations between\r\na mild and uniform climate at one extreme, and a complex and varied\r\nclimate at the other, but it would not explain the rapid climatic\r\npulsations which are closely associated with great movements of the\r\nearth's crust. It might prepare the way for them, but could not cause\r\nthem. That this conclusion is true is borne out by the fact that vast\r\nmountain ranges, like those at the close of the Jurassic and Cretaceous,\r\nare upheaved without bringing on glacial climates. Moreover, the marked\r\nPermian ice age follows long after the birth of the Hercynian Mountains\r\nand before the rise of others of later Permian origin.\r\n\r\nIV. _The Volcanic Hypothesis._ In the search for some cause of climatic\r\nchange which is highly efficient and yet able to vary rapidly and\r\nindependently, Abbot, Fowle, Humphreys, and others,[12] have concluded\r\nthat volcanic eruptions are the missing agency. In _Physics of the Air_,\r\nHumphreys gives a careful study of the effect of volcanic dust upon\r\nterrestrial temperature. He begins with a mathematical investigation of\r\nthe size of dust particles, and their quantity after certain eruptions.\r\nHe demonstrates that the power of such particles to deflect light of\r\nshort wave-lengths coming from the sun is perhaps thirty times more than\r\ntheir power to retain the heat radiated in long waves from the earth.\r\nHence it is estimated that if a Krakatoa were to belch forth dust every\r\nyear or two, the dust veil might cause a reduction of about 6 deg.C. in the\r\nearth's surface temperature. As in every such complicated problem, some\r\nof the author's assumptions are open to question, but this touches their\r\nquantitative and not their qualitative value. It seems certain that if\r\nvolcanic explosions were frequent enough and violent enough, the\r\ntemperature of the earth's surface would be considerably lowered.\r\n\r\nActual observation supports this theoretical conclusion. Humphreys\r\ngathers together and amplifies all that he and Abbot and Fowle have\r\npreviously said as to observations of the sun's thermal radiation by\r\nmeans of the pyrheliometer. This summing up of the relations between the\r\nheat received from the sun, and the occurrence of explosive volcanic\r\neruptions leaves little room for doubt that at frequent intervals during\r\nthe last century and a half a slight lowering of terrestrial temperature\r\nhas actually occurred after great eruptions. Nevertheless, it does not\r\njustify Humphreys' final conclusion that \"phenomena within the earth\r\nitself suffice to modify its own climate, ... that these and these alone\r\nhave actually caused great changes time and again in the geologic past.\"\r\nHumphreys sees so clearly the importance of the purely terrestrial point\r\nof view that he unconsciously slights the cosmic standpoint and ignores\r\nthe important solar facts which he himself adduces elsewhere at\r\nconsiderable length.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this the _degree_ to which the temperature of the earth\r\nas a whole is influenced by volcanic eruptions is by no means so clear\r\nas is the fact that there is some influence. Arctowski,[13] for example,\r\nhas prepared numerous curves showing the march of temperature month\r\nafter month for many years. During the period from 1909 to 1913, which\r\nincludes the great eruption of Katmai in Alaska, low temperature is\r\nfound to have prevailed at the time of the eruption, but, as Arctowski\r\nputs it, on the basis of the curves for 150 stations in all parts of the\r\nworld: \"The supposition that these abnormally low temperatures were due\r\nto the veil of volcanic dust produced by the Katmai eruption of June 6,\r\n1912, is completely out of the question. If that had been the case,\r\ntemperature would have decreased from that date on, whereas it was\r\ndecreasing for more than a year before that date.\"\r\n\r\nKoeppen,[14] in his comprehensive study of temperature for a hundred\r\nyears, also presents a strong argument against the idea that volcanic\r\neruptions have an important place in determining the present temperature\r\nof the earth. A volcanic eruption is a sudden occurrence. Whatever\r\neffect is produced by dust thrown into the air must occur within a few\r\nmonths, or as soon as the dust has had an opportunity to be wafted to\r\nthe region in question. When the dust arrives, there will be a rapid\r\ndrop through the few degrees of temperature which the dust is supposed\r\nto be able to account for, and thereafter a slow rise of temperature. If\r\nvolcanic eruptions actually caused a frequent lowering of terrestrial\r\ntemperature in the hundred years studied by Koeppen, there should be more\r\ncases where the annual temperature is decidedly below the normal than\r\nwhere it shows a large departure in the opposite direction. The contrary\r\nis actually the case.\r\n\r\nA still more important argument is the fact that the earth is now in an\r\nintermediate condition of climate. Throughout most of geologic time, as\r\nwe shall see again and again, the climate of the earth has been milder\r\nthan now. Regions like Greenland have not been the seat of glaciers, but\r\nhave been the home of types of plants which now thrive in relatively low\r\nlatitudes. In other words, the earth is today only part way from a\r\nglacial epoch to what may be called the normal, mild climate of the\r\nearth--a climate in which the contrast from zone to zone was much less\r\nthan now, and the lower air averaged warmer. Hence it seems impossible\r\nto avoid the conclusion that the cause of glaciation is still operating\r\nwith considerable although diminished efficiency. But volcanic dust is\r\nobviously not operating to any appreciable extent at present, for the\r\nupper air is almost free from dust a large part of the time.\r\n\r\nAgain, as Chamberlin suggests, let it be supposed that a Krakatoan\r\neruption every two years would produce a glacial period. Unless the most\r\nexperienced field workers on the glacial formations are quite in error,\r\nthe various glacial epochs of the Pleistocene glacial period had a joint\r\nduration of at least 150,000 years and perhaps twice as much. That would\r\nrequire 75,000 Krakatoan eruptions. But where are the pits and cones of\r\nsuch eruptions? There has not been time to erode them away since the\r\nPleistocene glaciation. Their beds of volcanic ash would presumably be\r\nas voluminous as the glacial beds, but there do not seem to be\r\naccumulations of any such size. Even though the same volcano suffered\r\nrepeated explosions, it seems impossible to find sufficient fresh\r\nvolcanic debris. Moreover, the volcanic hypothesis has not yet offered\r\nany mechanism for systematic glacial variations. Hence, while the\r\nhypothesis is important, we must search further for the full explanation\r\nof glacial fluctuations, historic pulsations, and the earth's present\r\nquasi-glacial climate.\r\n\r\nV. _The Hypothesis of Polar Wandering._ Another hypothesis, which has\r\nsome adherents, especially among geologists, holds that the position of\r\nthe earth's axis has shifted repeatedly during geological times, thus\r\ncausing glaciation in regions which are not now polar. Astrophysicists,\r\nhowever, are quite sure that no agency could radically change the\r\nrelation between the earth and its axis without likewise altering the\r\norbits of the planets to a degree that would be easily recognized.\r\nMoreover, the distribution of the centers of glaciation both in the\r\nPermian and Pleistocene periods does not seem to conform to this\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nVI. _The Thermal Solar Hypothesis._ The only other explanations of the\r\nclimatic changes of glacial and historic times which now seem to have\r\nmuch standing are two distinct and almost antagonistic solar hypotheses.\r\nOne is the idea that changes in the earth's climate are due to\r\nvariations in the heat emitted by the sun and hence in the temperature\r\nof the earth. The other is the entirely different idea that climatic\r\nchanges arise from solar conditions which cause a _redistribution of the\r\nearth's atmospheric pressure_ and hence produce changes in winds, ocean\r\ncurrents, and especially storms. This second, or \"cyclonic,\" hypothesis\r\nis the subject of a book entitled _Earth and Sun_, which is to be\r\npublished as a companion to the present volume. It will be outlined in\r\nthe next chapter. The other, or thermal, hypothesis may be dismissed\r\nbriefly. Unquestionably a permanent change in the amount of heat emitted\r\nby the sun would permanently alter the earth's climate. There is\r\nabsolutely no evidence, however, of any such change during geologic\r\ntime. The evidence as to the earth's cosmic uniformity and as to secular\r\nprogression is all against it. Suppose that for thirty or forty thousand\r\nyears the sun cooled off enough so that the earth was as cool as during\r\na glacial epoch. As glaciation is soon succeeded by a mild climate, some\r\nagency would then be needed to raise the sun's temperature. The impact\r\nof a shower of meteorites might accomplish this, but that would mean a\r\nvery sudden heating, such as there is no evidence of in geological\r\nhistory. In fact, there is far more evidence of sudden cooling than of\r\nsudden heating. Moreover, it is far beyond the bounds of probability\r\nthat such an impact should be repeated again and again with just such\r\nforce as to bring the climate back almost to where it started and yet to\r\nallow for the slight changes which cause secular progression. Another\r\nand equally cogent objection to the thermal form of solar hypothesis is\r\nstated by Humphreys as follows: \"A change of the solar constant\r\nobviously alters all surface temperatures by a roughly constant\r\npercentage. Hence a decrease of the heat from the sun would in general\r\ncause a decrease of the interzonal temperature gradients; and this in\r\nturn a less vigorous atmospheric circulation, and a less copious rain or\r\nsnowfall--exactly the reverse of the condition, namely, abundant\r\nprecipitation, most favorable to extensive glaciation.\"\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the end of the main hypotheses as to climatic changes,\r\naside from the solar cyclonic hypothesis which will be discussed in the\r\nnext chapter. It appears that variations in the position of the earth at\r\nperihelion have a real though slight influence in causing cycles with a\r\nlength of about 21,000 years. Changes in the carbon dioxide of the air\r\nprobably have a more important but extremely slow influence upon\r\ngeologic oscillations. Variations in the size, shape, and height of the\r\ncontinents are constantly causing all manner of climatic complications,\r\nbut do not cause rapid fluctuations and pulsations. The eruption of\r\nvolcanic dust appears occasionally to lower the temperature, but its\r\npotency to explain the complex climatic changes recorded in the rocks\r\nhas probably been exaggerated. Finally, although minor changes in the\r\namount of heat given out by the sun occur constantly and have been\r\ndemonstrated to have a climatic effect, there is no evidence that such\r\nchanges are the main cause of the climatic phenomena which we are trying\r\nto explain. Nevertheless, in connection with other solar changes they\r\nmay be of high importance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: James Croll: Climate and Time, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: T. C.

Intern., 1907 (=1908), pp. 299-325.\r\n\r\nThe exact origin of the carbon dioxide theory has been stated so\r\nvariously that it seems worth while to give the exact facts. Prompted by\r\nthe suggestion, of Tyndall that glaciation might be due to depletion of\r\natmospheric carbon dioxide, Chamberlin worked up the essentials of his\r\nearly views before he saw any publication from Arrhenius, to whom the\r\nidea has often been attributed. In 1895 or earlier Chamberlin began to\r\ngive the carbon dioxide hypothesis to his students and to discuss it\r\nbefore local scientific bodies. In 1897 he prepared a paper on \"A Group\r\nof Hypotheses Bearing on Climatic Changes,\" Jour. Geol., Vol. V (1897),\r\nto be read at the meeting of the British Association at Toronto, basing\r\nhis conclusions on Tyndall's determination of the competency of carbon\r\ndioxide as an absorber of heat radiated from the earth. He had\r\nessentially completed this when a paper by Arrhenius, \"On the influence\r\nof carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature of the ground,\" Phil.\r\nMag., 1896, pp. 237-276, first came to his attention. Chamberlin then\r\nchanged his conservative, tentative statement of the functions of carbon\r\ndioxide to a more sweeping one based on Arrhenius' very definite\r\nquantitative deductions from Langley's experiments. Both Langley and\r\nArrhenius were then in the ascendancy of their reputations and seemingly\r\nhigher authorities could scarcely have been chosen, nor a finer\r\ncombination than experiment and physico-mathematical development.\r\nArrhenius' deductions were later proved to have been overstrained, while\r\nLangley's interpretation and even his observations were challenged.\r\nChamberlin's latest views are more like his earlier and more\r\nconservative statement.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: C.

A few live and are for a time widely\r\naccepted. Then some new hypothesis either destroys them completely or\r\nshows that, while they contain elements of truth, they are not the whole\r\ntruth. In the previous chapter we have discussed a group of hypotheses\r\nof this kind, and have tried to point out fairly their degree of truth\r\nso far as it can yet be determined. In this chapter we shall outline\r\nstill another hypothesis, the relation of which to present climatic\r\nconditions has been fully developed in _Earth and Sun_; while its\r\nrelation to the past will be explained in the present volume. This\r\nhypothesis is not supposed to supersede the others, for so far as they\r\nare true they cannot be superseded. It merely seems to explain some of\r\nthe many conditions which the other hypotheses apparently fail to\r\nexplain. To suppose that it will suffer a fate more glorious than its\r\npredecessors would be presumptuous. The best that can be hoped is that\r\nafter it has been pruned, enriched, and modified, it may take its place\r\namong the steps which finally lead to the goal of truth.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter the new hypothesis will be sketched in broad outline in\r\norder that in the rest of this book the reader may appreciate the\r\nbearing of all that is said. Details of proof and methods of work will\r\nbe omitted, since they are given in _Earth and Sun_. For the sake of\r\nbrevity and clearness the main conclusions will be stated without the\r\nqualifications and exceptions which are fully explained in that volume.\r\nHere it will be necessary to pass quickly over points which depart\r\nradically from accepted ideas, and which therefore must arouse serious\r\nquestion in the minds of thoughtful readers. That, however, is a\r\nnecessary consequence of the attempt which this book makes to put the\r\nproblem of climate in such form that the argument can be followed by\r\nthoughtful students in any branch of knowledge and not merely by\r\nspecialists. Therefore, the specialist can merely be asked to withhold\r\njudgment until he has read all the evidence as given in _Earth and Sun_,\r\nand then to condemn only those parts that are wrong and not the whole\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nWithout further explanation let us turn to our main problem. In the\r\nrealm of climatology the most important discovery of the last generation\r\nis that variations in the weather depend on variations in the activity\r\nof the sun's atmosphere. The work of the great astronomer, Newcomb, and\r\nthat of the great climatologist, Koeppen, have shown beyond question that\r\nthe temperature of the earth's surface varies in harmony with variations\r\nin the number and area of sunspots.[15] The work of Abbot has shown that\r\nthe amount of heat radiated from the sun also varies, and that in\r\ngeneral the variations correspond with those of the sunspots, although\r\nthere are exceptions, especially when the spots are fewest. Here,\r\nhowever, there at once arises a puzzling paradox. The earth certainly\r\nowes its warmth to the sun. Yet when the sun emits the most energy, that\r\nis, when sunspots are most numerous, the earth's surface is coolest.\r\nDoubtless the earth receives more heat than usual at such times, and the\r\nupper air may be warmer than usual. Here we refer only to the air at the\r\nearth's surface.\r\n\r\nAnother large group of investigators have shown that atmospheric\r\npressure also varies in harmony with the number of sunspots. Some parts\r\nof the earth's surface have one kind of variation at times of many\r\nsunspots and other parts the reverse. These differences are systematic\r\nand depend largely on whether the region in question happens to have\r\nhigh atmospheric pressure or low. The net result is that when sunspots\r\nare numerous the earth's storminess increases, and the atmosphere is\r\nthrown into commotion. This interferes with the stable planetary winds,\r\nsuch as the trades of low latitudes and the prevailing westerlies of\r\nhigher latitudes. Instead of these regular winds and the fair weather\r\nwhich they bring, there is a tendency toward frequent tropical\r\nhurricanes in the lower latitudes and toward more frequent and severe\r\nstorms of the ordinary type in the latitudes where the world's most\r\nprogressive nations now live. With the change in storminess there\r\nnaturally goes a change in rainfall. Not all parts of the world,\r\nhowever, have increased storminess and more abundant rainfall when\r\nsunspots are numerous. Some parts change in the opposite way. Thus when\r\nthe sun's atmosphere is particularly disturbed, the contrasts between\r\ndifferent parts of the earth's surface are increased. For example, the\r\nnorthern United States and southern Canada become more stormy and rainy,\r\nas appears in Fig. 2, and the same is true of the Southwest and along\r\nthe south Atlantic coast. In a crescent-shaped central area, however,\r\nextending from Wyoming through Missouri to Nova Scotia, the number of\r\nstorms and the amount of rainfall decrease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 2. Storminess at sunspot maxima vs. minima._\r\n(_After Kullmer._)\r\n\r\nBased on nine years' nearest sunspot minima and nine years' nearest\r\nsunspot maxima in the three sunspot cycles from 1888 to 1918. Heavy\r\nshading indicates excess of storminess when sunspots are numerous.\r\nFigures indicate average yearly number of storms by which years of\r\nmaximum sunspots exceed those of minimum sunspots.]\r\n\r\nThe two controlling factors of any climate are the temperature and the\r\natmospheric pressure, for they determine the winds, the storms, and thus\r\nthe rainfall. A study of the temperature seems to show that the peculiar\r\nparadox of a hot sun and a cool earth is due largely to the increased\r\nstorminess during times of many sunspots. The earth's surface is heated\r\nby the rays of the sun, but most of the rays do not in themselves heat\r\nthe air as they pass through it. The air gets its heat largely from the\r\nheat absorbed by the water vapor which is intimately mingled with its\r\nlower portions, or from the long heat waves sent out by the earth after\r\nit has been warmed by the sun. The faster the air moves along the\r\nearth's surface the less it becomes heated, and the more heat it takes\r\naway. This sounds like a contradiction, but not to anyone who has tried\r\nto heat a stove in the open air. If the air is still, the stove rapidly\r\nbecomes warm and so does the air around it. If the wind is blowing, the\r\ncool air delays the heating of the stove and prevents the surface from\r\never becoming as hot as it would otherwise. That seems to be what\r\nhappens on a large scale when sunspots are numerous. The sun actually\r\nsends to the earth more energy than usual, but the air moves with such\r\nunusual rapidity that it actually cools the earth's surface a trifle by\r\ncarrying the extra heat to high levels where it is lost into space.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to why storms are numerous when the\r\nsun's atmosphere is disturbed. Many investigators have supposed it was\r\ndue entirely and directly to the heating of the earth's surface by the\r\nsun. This, however, needs modification for several reasons. In the first\r\nplace, recent investigations show that in a great many cases changes in\r\nbarometric pressure precede changes in temperature and apparently cause\r\nthem by altering the winds and producing storms. This is the opposite of\r\nwhat would happen if the effect of solar heat upon the earth's surface\r\nwere the only agency. In the second place, if storms were due\r\nexclusively to variations in the ordinary solar radiation which comes to\r\nthe earth as light and is converted into heat, the solar effect ought to\r\nbe most pronounced when the center of the sun's visible disk is most\r\ndisturbed. As a matter of fact the storminess is notably greatest when\r\nthe edges of the solar disk are most disturbed. These facts and others\r\nlead to the conclusion that some agency other than heat must also play\r\nsome part in producing storminess.\r\n\r\nThe search for this auxiliary agency raises many difficult questions\r\nwhich cannot yet be answered. On the whole the weight of evidence\r\nsuggests that electrical phenomena of some kind are involved, although\r\nvariations in the amount of ultra-violet light may also be important.\r\nMany investigators have shown that the sun emits electrons. Hale has\r\nproved that the sun, like the earth, is magnetized. Sunspots also have\r\nmagnetic fields the strength of which is often fifty times as great as\r\nthat of the sun as a whole. If electrons are sent to the earth, they\r\nmust move in curved paths, for they are deflected by the sun's magnetic\r\nfield and again by the earth's magnetic field. The solar deflection may\r\ncause their effects to be greatest when the spots are near the sun's\r\nmargin; the terrestrial deflection may cause concentration in bands\r\nroughly concentric with the magnetic poles of the earth. These\r\nconditions correspond with the known facts.\r\n\r\nFarther than this we cannot yet go. The calculations of Humphreys seem\r\nto indicate that the direct electrical effect of the sun's electrons\r\nupon atmospheric pressure is too small to be of appreciable significance\r\nin intensifying storms. On the other hand the peculiar way in which\r\nactivity upon the margins of the sun appears to be correlated not only\r\nwith atmospheric electricity, but with barometric pressure, seems to be\r\nequally strong evidence in the other direction. Possibly the sun's\r\nelectrons and its electrical waves produce indirect effects by being\r\nconverted into heat, or by causing the formation of ozone and the\r\ncondensation of water vapor in the upper air. Any one of these processes\r\nwould raise the temperature of the upper air, for the ozone and the\r\nwater vapor would be formed there and would tend to act as a blanket to\r\nhold in the earth's heat. But any such change in the temperature of the\r\nupper air would influence the lower air through changes in barometric\r\npressure. These considerations are given here because the thoughtful\r\nreader is likely to inquire how solar activity can influence storminess.\r\nMoreover, at the end of this book we shall take up certain speculative\r\nquestions in which an electrical hypothesis will be employed. For the\r\nmain portions of this book it makes no difference how the sun's\r\nvariations influence the earth's atmosphere. The only essential point is\r\nthat when the solar atmosphere is active the storminess of the earth\r\nincreases, and that is a matter of direct observation.\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire into the relation between the small cyclonic\r\nvacillations of the weather and the types of climatic changes known as\r\nhistoric pulsations and glacial fluctuations. One of the most\r\ninteresting results of recent investigations is the evidence that\r\nsunspot cycles on a small scale present almost the same phenomena as do\r\nhistoric pulsations and glacial fluctuations. For instance, when\r\nsunspots are numerous, storminess increases markedly in a belt near the\r\nnorthern border of the area of greatest storminess, that is, in southern\r\nCanada and thence across the Atlantic to the North Sea and Scandinavia.\r\n(See Figs. 2 and 3.) Corresponding with this is the fact that the\r\nevidence as to climatic pulsations in historic times indicates that\r\nregions along this path, for instance Greenland, the North Sea region,\r\nand southern Scandinavia, were visited by especially frequent and severe\r\nstorms at the climax of each pulsation. Moreover, the greatest\r\naccumulations of ice in the glacial period were on the poleward border\r\nof the general regions where now the storms appear to increase most at\r\ntimes of solar activity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 3A.

The excess or deficiency is stated in percentages of\r\nthe average. Rainfall data from Walker: Sunspots and Rainfall.]\r\n\r\nEven more clear is the evidence from other regions where storms increase\r\nat times of many sunspots. One such region includes the southwestern\r\nUnited States, while another is the Mediterranean region and the\r\nsemi-arid or desert parts of Asia farther east. In these regions\r\ninnumerable ruins and other lines of evidence show that at the climax of\r\neach climatic pulsation there was more storminess and rainfall than at\r\npresent, just as there now is when the sun is most active. In still\r\nearlier times, while ice was accumulating farther north, the basins of\r\nthese semi-arid regions were filled with lakes whose strands still\r\nremain to tell the tale of much-increased rainfall and presumable\r\nstorminess. If we go back still further in geological times to the\r\nPermian glaciation, the areas where ice accumulated most abundantly\r\nappear to be the regions where tropical hurricanes produce the greatest\r\nrainfall and the greatest lowering of temperature at times of many\r\nsunspots. From these and many other lines of evidence it seems probable\r\nthat historic pulsations and glacial fluctuations are nothing more than\r\nsunspot cycles on a large scale. It is one of the fundamental rules of\r\nscience to reason from the known to the unknown, from the near to the\r\nfar, from the present to the past. Hence it seems advisable to\r\ninvestigate whether any of the climatic phenomena of the past may have\r\narisen from an intensification of the solar conditions which now appear\r\nto give rise to similar phenomena on a small scale.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this chapter will be devoted to a _resume_ of certain\r\ntentative conclusions which have no bearing on the main part of this\r\nbook, but which apply to the closing chapters. There we shall inquire\r\ninto the periodicity of the climatic phenomena of geological times, and\r\nshall ask whether there is any reason to suppose that the sun's activity\r\nhas exhibited similar periodicity. This leads to an investigation of the\r\npossible causes of disturbances in the sun's atmosphere. It is generally\r\nassumed that sunspots, solar prominences, the bright clouds known as\r\nfaculae, and other phenomena denoting a perturbed state of the solar\r\natmosphere, are due to some cause within the sun. Yet the limitation of\r\nthese phenomena, especially the sunspots, to restricted latitudes, as\r\nhas been shown in _Earth and Sun_, does not seem to be in harmony with\r\nan internal solar origin, even though a banded arrangement may be normal\r\nfor a rotating globe. The fairly regular periodicity of the sunspots\r\nseems equally out of harmony with an internal origin. Again, the solar\r\natmosphere has two kinds of circulation, one the so-called \"rice\r\ngrains,\" and the other the spots and their attendant phenomena. Now the\r\nrice grains present the appearance that would be expected in an\r\natmospheric circulation arising from the loss of heat by the outer part\r\nof a gaseous body like the sun. For these reasons and others numerous\r\ngood thinkers from Wolf to Schuster have held that sunspots owe their\r\nperiodicity to causes outside the sun. The only possible cause seems to\r\nbe the planets, acting either through gravitation, through forces of an\r\nelectrical origin, or through some other agency. Various new\r\ninvestigations which are described in _Earth and Sun_ support this\r\nconclusion. The chief difficulty in accepting it hitherto has been that\r\nalthough Jupiter, because of its size, would be expected to dominate the\r\nsunspot cycle, its period of 11.86 years has not been detected. The\r\nsunspot cycle has appeared to average 11.2 years in length, and has been\r\ncalled the 11-year cycle. Nevertheless, a new analysis of the sunspot\r\ndata shows that when attention is concentrated upon the major maxima,\r\nwhich are least subject to retardation or acceleration by other causes,\r\na periodicity closely approaching that of Jupiter is evident. Moreover,\r\nwhen the effects of Jupiter, Saturn, and the other planets are combined,\r\nthey produce a highly variable curve which has an extraordinary\r\nresemblance to the sunspot curve. The method by which the planets\r\ninfluence the sun's atmosphere is still open to question. It may be\r\nthrough tides, through the direct effect of gravitation, through\r\nelectro-magnetic forces, or in some other way. Whichever it may be, the\r\nresult may perhaps be slight differences of atmospheric pressure upon\r\nthe sun. Such differences may set in motion slight whirling movements\r\nanalogous to terrestrial storms, and these presumably gather momentum\r\nfrom the sun's own energy. Since the planetary influences vary in\r\nstrength because of the continuous change in the relative distances and\r\npositions of the planets, the sun's atmosphere appears to be swayed by\r\ncyclonic disturbances of varying degrees of severity. The cyclonic\r\ndisturbances known as sunspots have been proved by Hale to become more\r\nhighly electrified as they increase in intensity. At the same time hot\r\ngases presumably well up from the lower parts of the solar atmosphere\r\nand thereby cause the sun to emit more heat. Thus by one means or\r\nanother, the earth's atmosphere appears to be set in commotion and\r\ncycles of climate are inaugurated.\r\n\r\nIf the preceding reasoning is correct, any disturbance of the solar\r\natmosphere must have an effect upon the earth's climate. If the\r\ndisturbance were great enough and of the right nature it might produce a\r\nglacial epoch. The planets are by no means the only bodies which act\r\nupon the sun, for that body sustains a constantly changing relation to\r\nmillions of other celestial bodies of all sizes up to vast universes,\r\nand at all sorts of distances. If the sun and another star should\r\napproach near enough to one another, it is certain that the solar\r\natmosphere would be disturbed much more than at present.\r\n\r\nHere we must leave the cyclonic hypothesis of climate and must refer the\r\nreader once more to _Earth and Sun_ for fuller details. In the rest of\r\nthis book we shall discuss the nature of the climatic changes of past\r\ntimes and shall inquire into their relation to the various climatic\r\nhypotheses mentioned in the last two chapters. Then we shall inquire\r\ninto the possibility that the solar system has ever been near enough to\r\nany of the stars to cause appreciable disturbances of the solar\r\natmosphere. We shall complete our study by investigating the vexed\r\nquestion of why movements of the earth's crust, such as the uplifting of\r\ncontinents and mountain chains, have generally occurred at the same time\r\nas great climatic fluctuations. This would not be so surprising were it\r\nnot that the climatic phenomena appear to have consisted of highly\r\ncomplex cycles while the uplift has been a relatively steady movement in\r\none direction. We shall find some evidence that the solar disturbances\r\nwhich seem to cause climatic changes also have a relation to movements\r\nof the crust.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The so-called sunspot numbers to which reference is made\r\nagain and again in this book are based on a system devised by Wolf and\r\nrevised by A. Wolfer. The number and size of the spots are both taken\r\ninto account. The numbers from 1749 to 1900 may be found in the Monthly\r\nWeather Review for April, 1902, and from 1901 to 1918 in the same\r\njournal for 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMATE OF HISTORY[16]\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to consider the climate of the past. The first\r\nperiod to claim attention is the few thousand years covered by written\r\nhistory. Strangely enough, the conditions during this time are known\r\nwith less accuracy than are those of geological periods hundreds of\r\ntimes more remote. Yet if pronounced changes have occurred since the\r\ndays of the ancient Babylonians and since the last of the post-glacial\r\nstages, they are of great importance not only because of their possible\r\nhistoric effects, but because they bridge the gap between the little\r\nvariations of climate which are observable during a single lifetime and\r\nthe great changes known as glacial epochs. Only by bridging the gap can\r\nwe determine whether there is any genetic relation between the great\r\nchanges and the small. A full discussion of the climate of historic\r\ntimes is not here advisable, for it has been considered in detail in\r\nnumerous other publications.[17] Our most profitable course would seem\r\nto be to consider first the general trend of opinion and then to take up\r\nthe chief objections to each of the main hypotheses.\r\n\r\nIn the hot debate over this problem during recent decades the ideas of\r\ngeographers seem to have gone through much the same metamorphosis as\r\nhave those of geologists in regard to the climate of far earlier times.\r\n\r\nAs every geologist well knows, at the dawn of geology people believed in\r\nclimatic uniformity--that is, it was supposed that since the completion\r\nof an original creative act there had been no important changes. This\r\nview quickly disappeared and was superseded by the hypothesis of\r\nprogressive cooling and drying, an hypothesis which had much to do with\r\nthe development of the nebular hypothesis, and which has in turn been\r\ngreatly strengthened by that hypothesis. The discovery of evidence of\r\nwidespread continental glaciation, however, necessitated a modification\r\nof this view, and succeeding years have brought to light a constantly\r\nincreasing number of glacial, or at least cool, periods distributed\r\nthroughout almost the whole of geological time. Moreover, each year,\r\nalmost, brings new evidence of the great complexity of glacial periods,\r\nepochs, and stages. Thus, for many decades, geologists have more and\r\nmore been led to believe that in spite of surprising uniformity, when\r\nviewed in comparison with the cosmic possibilities, the climate of the\r\npast has been highly unstable from the viewpoint of organic evolution,\r\nand its changes have been of all degrees of intensity.\r\n\r\nGeographers have lately been debating the reality of historic changes of\r\nclimate in the same way in which geologists debated the reality of\r\nglacial epochs and stages. Several hypotheses present themselves but\r\nthese may all be grouped under three headings; namely, the hypotheses of\r\n(1) progressive desiccation, (2) climatic uniformity, and (3)\r\npulsations. The hypothesis of progressive desiccation has been widely\r\nadvocated. In many of the drier portions of the world, especially\r\nbetween 30 deg. and 40 deg. from the equator, and preeminently in western and\r\ncentral Asia and in the southwestern United States, almost innumerable\r\nfacts seem to indicate that two or three thousand years ago the climate\r\nwas distinctly moister than at present. The evidence includes old lake\r\nstrands, the traces of desiccated springs, roads in places now too dry\r\nfor caravans, other roads which make detours around dry lake beds where\r\nno lakes now exist, and fragments of dead forests extending over\r\nhundreds of square miles where trees cannot now grow for lack of water.\r\nStill stronger evidence is furnished by ancient ruins, hundreds of which\r\nare located in places which are now so dry that only the merest fraction\r\nof the former inhabitants could find water. The ruins of Palmyra, in the\r\nSyrian Desert, show that it must once have been a city like modern\r\nDamascus, with one or two hundred thousand inhabitants, but its water\r\nsupply now suffices for only one or two thousand. All attempts to\r\nincrease the water supply have had only a slight effect and the water is\r\nnotoriously sulphurous, whereas in the former days, when it was\r\nabundant, it was renowned for its excellence. Hundreds of pages might be\r\ndevoted to describing similar ruins. Some of them are even more\r\nremarkable for their dryness than is Niya, a site in the Tarim Desert of\r\nChinese Turkestan. Yet there the evidence of desiccation within 2000\r\nyears is so strong that even so careful and conservative a man as\r\nHann,[18] pronounces it \"ueberzeugend.\"\r\n\r\nA single quotation from scores that might be used will illustrate the\r\nconclusions of some of the most careful archaeologists.[19]\r\n\r\n     Among the regions which were once populous and highly civilized,\r\n     but which are now desert and deserted, there are few which were\r\n     more closely connected with the beginnings of our own civilization\r\n     than the desert parts of Syria and northern Arabia. It is only of\r\n     recent years that the vast extent and great importance of this lost\r\n     civilization has been fully recognized and that attempts have been\r\n     made to reduce the extent of the unexplored area and to discover\r\n     how much of the territory which has long been known as desert was\r\n     formerly habitable and inhabited. The results of the explorations\r\n     of the last twenty years have been most astonishing in this regard.\r\n     It has been found that practically all of the wide area lying\r\n     between the coast range of the eastern Mediterranean and the\r\n     Euphrates, appearing upon the maps as the Syrian Desert, an area\r\n     embracing somewhat more than 20,000 square miles, was more thickly\r\n     populated than any area of similar dimensions in England or in the\r\n     United States is today if one excludes the immediate vicinity of\r\n     the large modern cities. It has also been discovered that an\r\n     enormous desert tract lying to the east of Palestine, stretching\r\n     eastward and southward into the country which we know as Arabia,\r\n     was also a densely populated country. How far these settled regions\r\n     extended in antiquity is still unknown, but the most distant\r\n     explorations in these directions have failed to reach the end of\r\n     ruins and other signs of former occupation.\r\n\r\n     The traveler who has crossed the settled, and more or less\r\n     populous, coast range of northern Syria and descended into the\r\n     narrow fertile valley of the Orontes, encounters in any farther\r\n     journey toward the east an irregular range of limestone hills lying\r\n     north and south and stretching to the northeast almost halfway to\r\n     the Euphrates. These hills are about 2,500 feet high, rising in\r\n     occasional peaks from 3,000 to 3,500 feet above sea level. They are\r\n     gray and unrelieved by any visible vegetation. On ascending into\r\n     the hills the traveler is astonished to find at every turn remnants\r\n     of the work of men's hands, paved roads, walls which divided\r\n     fields, terrace walls of massive structure. Presently he comes upon\r\n     a small deserted and partly ruined town composed of buildings large\r\n     and small constructed of beautifully wrought blocks of limestone,\r\n     all rising out of the barren rock which forms the ribs of the\r\n     hills. If he mounts an eminence in the vicinity, he will be still\r\n     further astonished to behold similar ruins lying in all directions.\r\n     He may count ten or fifteen or twenty, according to the commanding\r\n     position of his lookout. From a distance it is often difficult to\r\n     believe that these are not inhabited places; but closer inspection\r\n     reveals that the gentle hand of time or the rude touch of\r\n     earthquake has been laid upon every building. Some of the towns are\r\n     better preserved than others; some buildings are quite perfect but\r\n     for their wooden roofs which time has removed, others stand in\r\n     picturesque ruins, while others still are level with the ground. On\r\n     a far-off hilltop stands the ruin of a pagan temple, and crowning\r\n     some lofty ridge lie the ruins of a great Christian monastery. Mile\r\n     after mile of this barren gray country may be traversed without\r\n     encountering a single human being. Day after day may be spent in\r\n     traveling from one ruined town to another without seeing any green\r\n     thing save a terebinth tree or two standing among the ruins, which\r\n     have sent their roots down into earth still preserved in the\r\n     foundations of some ancient building. No soil is visible anywhere\r\n     except in a few pockets in the rock from which it could not be\r\n     washed by the torrential rains of the wet season; yet every ruin is\r\n     surrounded with the remains of presses for the making of oil and\r\n     wine. Only one oasis has been discovered in these high plateaus.\r\n\r\n     Passing eastward from this range of hills, one descends into a\r\n     gently rolling country that stretches miles away toward the\r\n     Euphrates. At the eastern foot of the hills one finds oneself in a\r\n     totally different country, at first quite fertile and dotted with\r\n     frequent villages of flat-roofed houses. Here practically all the\r\n     remains of ancient times have been destroyed through ages of\r\n     building and rebuilding. Beyond this narrow fertile strip the soil\r\n     grows drier and more barren, until presently another kind of desert\r\n     is reached, an undulating waste of dead soil. Few walls or towers\r\n     or arches rise to break the monotony of the unbroken landscape; but\r\n     the careful explorer will find on closer examination that this\r\n     region was more thickly populated in antiquity even than the hill\r\n     country to the west. Every unevenness of the surface marks the site\r\n     of a town, some of them cities of considerable extent.\r\n\r\n     We may draw certain very definite conclusions as to the former\r\n     conditions of the country itself. There was soil upon the northern\r\n     hills where none now exists, for the buildings now show unfinished\r\n     foundation courses which were not intended to be seen; the soil in\r\n     depressions without outlets is deeper than it formerly was; there\r\n     are hundreds of olive and wine presses in localities where no tree\r\n     or vine could now find footing; and there are hillsides with ruined\r\n     terrace walls rising one above the other with no sign of earth near\r\n     them. There was also a large natural water supply. In the north as\r\n     well as in the south we find the dry beds of rivers, streams, and\r\n     brooks with sand and pebbles and well-worn rocks but no water in\r\n     them from one year's end to the other. We find bridges over these\r\n     dry streams and crudely made washing boards along their banks\r\n     directly below deserted towns. Many of the bridges span the beds of\r\n     streams that seldom or never have water in them and give clear\r\n     evidence of the great climatic changes that have taken place. There\r\n     are well heads and well houses, and inscriptions referring to\r\n     springs; but neither wells nor springs exist today except in the\r\n     rarest instances. Many of the houses had their rock-hewn cisterns,\r\n     never large enough to have supplied water for more than a brief\r\n     period, and corresponding to the cisterns which most of our recent\r\n     forefathers had which were for convenience rather than for\r\n     dependence. Some of the towns in southern Syria were provided with\r\n     large public reservoirs, but these are not large enough to have\r\n     supplied water to their original populations. The high plateaus\r\n     were of course without irrigation; but there are no signs, even in\r\n     the lower flatter country, that irrigation was ever practiced; and\r\n     canals for this purpose could not have completely disappeared.\r\n     There were forests in the immediate vicinity, forests producing\r\n     timbers of great length and thickness; for in the north and\r\n     northeast practically all the buildings had wooden roofs, wooden\r\n     intermediate floors, and other features of wood. Costly buildings,\r\n     such as temples and churches, employed large wooden beams; but wood\r\n     was used in much larger quantities in private dwellings, shops,\r\n     stables, and barns. If wood had not been plentiful and cheap--which\r\n     means grown near by--the builders would have adopted the building\r\n     methods of their neighbors in the south, who used very little wood\r\n     and developed the most perfect type of lithic architecture the\r\n     world has ever seen. And here there exists a strange anomaly:\r\n     Northern Syria, where so much wood was employed in antiquity, is\r\n     absolutely treeless now; while in the mountains of southern Syria,\r\n     where wood must have been scarce in antiquity to have forced upon\r\n     the inhabitants an almost exclusive use of stone, there are still\r\n     groves of scrub oak and pine, and travelers of half a century ago\r\n     reported large forests of chestnut trees.[20] It is perfectly\r\n     apparent that large parts of Syria once had soil and forests and\r\n     springs and rivers, while it has none of these now, and that it had\r\n     a much larger and better distributed rainfall in ancient times than\r\n     it has now.\r\n\r\nProfessor Butler's careful work is especially interesting because of its\r\ncontrast to the loose statements of those who believe in climatic\r\nuniformity. So far as I am aware, no opponent of the hypothesis of\r\nclimatic changes has ever even attempted to show by careful statistical\r\nanalysis that the ancient water supply of such ruins was no greater than\r\nthat of the present. The most that has been done is to suggest that\r\nthere may have been sources of water which are now unknown. Of course,\r\nthis might be true in a single instance, but it could scarcely be the\r\ncase in many hundreds or thousands of ruins.\r\n\r\nAlthough the arguments in favor of a change of climate during the last\r\ntwo thousand years seem too strong to be ignored, their very strength\r\nseems to have been a source of error. A large number of people have\r\njumped to the conclusion that the change which appears to have occurred\r\nin certain regions occurred everywhere, and that it consisted of a\r\ngradual desiccation.\r\n\r\nMany observers, quite as careful as those who believe in progressive\r\ndesiccation, point to evidences of aridity in past times in the very\r\nregions where the others find proof of moisture. Lakes such as the\r\nCaspian Sea fell to such a low level that parts of their present floors\r\nwere exposed and were used as sites for buildings whose ruins are still\r\nextant. Elsewhere, for instance in the Tian-Shan Mountains, irrigation\r\nditches are found in places where irrigation never seems to be necessary\r\nat present. In Syria and North Africa during the early centuries of the\r\nChristian era the Romans showed unparalleled activity in building great\r\naqueducts and in watering land which then apparently needed water almost\r\nas much as it does today. Evidence of this sort is abundant and is as\r\nconvincing as is the evidence of moister conditions in the past. It is\r\nadmirably set forth, for example, in the comprehensive and ably written\r\nmonograph of Leiter on the climate of North Africa.[21] The evidence\r\ncited there and elsewhere has led many authors strongly to advocate the\r\nhypothesis of climatic uniformity. They have done exactly as have the\r\nadvocates of progressive change, and have extended their conclusions\r\nover the whole world and over the whole of historic times.\r\n\r\nThe hypotheses of climatic uniformity and of progressive change both\r\nseem to be based on reliable evidence. They may seem to be diametrically\r\nopposed to one another, but this is only when there is a failure to\r\ngroup the various lines of evidence according to their dates, and\r\naccording to the types of climate in which they happen to be located.\r\nWhen the facts are properly grouped in both time and space, it appears\r\nthat evidence of moist conditions in the historic Mediterranean lands is\r\nfound during certain periods; for instance, four or five hundred years\r\nbefore Christ, at the time of Christ, and 1000 A. D. The other kind of\r\nevidence, on the contrary, culminates at other epochs, such as about\r\n1200 B. C. and in the seventh and thirteenth centuries after Christ. It\r\nis also found during the interval from the culmination of a moist epoch\r\nto the culmination of a dry one, for at such times the climate was\r\ngrowing drier and the people were under stress. This was seemingly the\r\ncase during the period from the second to the fourth centuries of our\r\nera. North Africa and Syria must then have been distinctly better\r\nwatered than at present, as appears from Butler's vivid description; but\r\nthey were gradually becoming drier, and the natural effect on a\r\nvigorous, competent people like the Romans was to cause them to\r\nconstruct numerous engineering works to provide the necessary water.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which have just been set forth have led to a third\r\nhypothesis, that of pulsatory climatic changes. According to this, the\r\nearth's climate is not stable, nor does it change uniformly in one\r\ndirection. It appears to fluctuate back and forth not only in the little\r\nwaves which we see from year to year or decade to decade, but in much\r\nlarger waves, which take hundreds of years or even a thousand. These in\r\nturn seem to merge into and be imposed on the greater waves which form\r\nglacial stages, glacial epochs, and glacial periods. At the present time\r\nthere seems to be no way of determining whether the general tendency is\r\ntoward aridity or toward glaciation. The seventh century of our era was\r\napparently the driest time during the historic period--distinctly drier\r\nthan the present--but the thirteenth century was almost equally dry, and\r\nthe twelfth or thirteenth before Christ may have been very dry.\r\n\r\nThe best test of an hypothesis is actual measurements. In the case of\r\nthe pulsatory hypothesis we are fortunately able to apply this test by\r\nmeans of trees. The growth of vegetation depends on many factors--soil,\r\nexposure, wind, sun, temperature, rain, and so forth. In a dry region\r\nthe most critical factor in determining how a tree's growth shall vary\r\nfrom year to year is the supply of moisture during the few months of\r\nmost rapid growth.[22] The work of Douglass[23] and others has shown\r\nthat in Arizona and California the thickness of the annual rings affords\r\na reliable indication of the amount of moisture available during the\r\nperiod of growth. This is especially true when the growth of several\r\nyears is taken as the unit and is compared with the growth of a similar\r\nnumber of years before or after. Where a long series of years is used,\r\nit is necessary to make corrections to eliminate the effects of age, but\r\nthis can be done by mathematical methods of considerable accuracy. It is\r\ndifficult to determine whether the climate at the beginning and end of a\r\ntree's life was the same, but it is easily possible to determine whether\r\nthere have been pulsations while the tree was making its growth. If a\r\nlarge number of trees from various parts of a given district all formed\r\nthick rings at a certain period and then formed thin ones for a hundred\r\nyears, after which the rings again become thick, we seem to be safe in\r\nconcluding that the trees have lived through a long, dry period. The\r\nfull reasons for this belief and details as to the methods of estimating\r\nclimate from tree growth are given in _The Climatic Factor_.\r\n\r\nThe results set forth in that volume may be summarized as follows:\r\nDuring the years 1911 and 1912, under the auspices of the Carnegie\r\nInstitution of Washington, measurements were made of the thickness of\r\nthe rings of growth on the stumps of about 450 sequoia trees in\r\nCalifornia. These trees varied in age from 250 to nearly 3250 years. The\r\ngreat majority were over 1000 years of age, seventy-nine were over 2000\r\nyears, and three over 3000. Even where only a few trees are available\r\nthe record is surprisingly reliable, except where occasional accidents\r\noccur. Where the number approximates 100, accidental variations are\r\nlargely eliminated and we may accept the record with considerable\r\nconfidence. Accordingly, we may say that in California we have a fairly\r\naccurate record of the climate for 2000 years and an approximate record\r\nfor 1000 years more. The final results of the measurements of the\r\nCalifornia trees are shown in Fig. 4, where the climatic variations for\r\n3000 years in California are indicated by the solid line. The high parts\r\nof the line indicate rainy conditions, the low parts, dry. An\r\nexamination of this curve shows that during 3000 years there have\r\napparently been climatic variations more important than any which have\r\ntaken place during the past century. In order to bring out the details\r\nmore clearly, the more reliable part of the California curve, from 100\r\nB. C. to the present time, has been reproduced in Fig. 5. This is\r\nidentical with the corresponding part of Fig. 4, except that the\r\nvertical scale is three times as great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 4. Changes of climate in California (solid line)\r\nand in western and central Asia (dotted line)._\r\n\r\nNote. The curves of Figs. 4 and 5 are reproduced as published in _The\r\nSolar Hypothesis_ in 1914. Later work, however, has indicated that in\r\nthe Asiatic curve the dash lines, which were tentatively inserted in\r\n1914, are probably more nearly correct than the dotted lines. Still\r\nfurther evidence indicates that the Asiatic curve is nearly like that of\r\nCalifornia in its main features.]\r\n\r\nThe curve of tree growth in California seems to be a true representation\r\nof the general features of climatic pulsations in the Mediterranean\r\nregion. This conclusion was originally based on the resemblance between\r\nthe solid line of Fig. 4, representing tree growth, and the dotted line\r\nrepresenting changes of climate in the eastern Mediterranean region as\r\ninferred from the study of ruins and of history before any work on this\r\nsubject had been done in America.[24] The dotted line is here reproduced\r\nfor its historical significance as a stage in the study of climatic\r\nchanges. If it were to be redrawn today on the basis of the knowledge\r\nacquired in the last twelve years, it would be much more like the tree\r\ncurve. For example, the period of aridity suggested by the dip of the\r\ndotted line about 300 A. D. was based largely on Professor Butler's data\r\nas to the paucity of inscriptions and ruins dating from that period in\r\nSyria. In the recent article, from which a long quotation has been\r\ngiven, he shows that later work proves that there is no such paucity. On\r\nthe other hand, it has accentuated the marked and sudden decay in\r\ncivilization and population which occurred shortly after 600 A. D. He\r\nreached the same conclusion to which the present authors had come on\r\nwholly different grounds, namely, that the dip in the dotted line about\r\n300 A. D. is not warranted, whereas the dip about 630 A. D. is extremely\r\nimportant. In similar fashion the work of Stein[25] in central Asia\r\nmakes it clear that the contrast between the water supply about 200 B.C.\r\nand in the preceding and following centuries was greater than was\r\nsupposed on the basis of the scanty evidence available when the dotted\r\nline of Fig. 4 was drawn in 1910.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 5. Changes in California climate for 2000 years,\r\nas measured by growth of Sequoia trees._\r\n\r\nFig. 5 is the same as the later portion of Fig. 4, except that the\r\nvertical scale has been magnified threefold. It seems probable that the\r\ndotted line at the right is more nearly correct than the solid line.\r\nDuring the thirty years since the end of the curve the general tendency\r\nappears in general to have been somewhat upward.]\r\n\r\nSince the curve of the California trees is the only continuous and\r\ndetailed record yet available for the climate of the last three thousand\r\nyears, it deserves most careful study. It is especially necessary to\r\ndetermine the degree of accuracy with which the growth of the trees\r\nrepresents (1) the local rainfall and (2) the rainfall of remote regions\r\nsuch as Palestine. Perhaps the best way to determine these matters is\r\nthe standard mathematical method of correlation coefficients. If two\r\nphenomena vary in perfect unison, as in the case of the turning of the\r\nwheels and the progress of an automobile when the brakes are not\r\napplied, the correlation coefficient is 1.00, being positive when the\r\nautomobile goes forward and negative when it goes backward. If there is\r\nno relation between two phenomena, as in the case of the number of miles\r\nrun by a given automobile each year and the number of chickens hatched\r\nin the same period, the coefficient is zero. A partial relationship\r\nwhere other factors enter into the matter is represented by a\r\ncoefficient between zero and one, as in the case of the movement of the\r\nautomobile and the consumption of gasoline. In this case the relation is\r\nvery obvious, but is modified by other factors, including the roughness\r\nand grade of the road, the amount of traffic, the number of stops, the\r\nskill of the driver, the condition and load of the automobile, and the\r\nstate of the weather. Such partial relationships are the kind for which\r\ncorrelation coefficients are most useful, for the size of the\r\ncoefficients shows the relative importance of the various factors. A\r\ncorrelation coefficient four times the probable error, which can always\r\nbe determined by a formula well known to mathematicians, is generally\r\nconsidered to afford evidence of some kind of relation between two\r\nphenomena. When the ratio between coefficient and error rises to six,\r\nthe relationship is regarded as strong.\r\n\r\nFew people would question that there is a connection between tree growth\r\nand rainfall, especially in a climate with a long summer dry season like\r\nthat of California. But the growth of the trees also depends on their\r\nposition, the amount of shading, the temperature, insect pests, blights,\r\nthe wind with its tendency to break the branches, and a number of other\r\nfactors. Moreover, while rain commonly favors growth, great extremes are\r\nrelatively less helpful than more moderate amounts. Again, the roots of\r\na tree may tap such deep sources of water that neither drought nor\r\nexcessive rain produces much effect for several years. Hence in\r\ncomparing the growth of the huge sequoias with the rainfall we should\r\nexpect a correlation coefficient high enough to be convincing, but\r\ndecidedly below 1.00. Unfortunately there is no record of the rainfall\r\nwhere the sequoias grow, the nearest long record being that of\r\nSacramento, nearly 200 miles to the northwest and close to sea level\r\ninstead of at an altitude of about 6000 feet.\r\n\r\nApplying the method of correlation coefficients to the annual rainfall\r\nof Sacramento and the growth of the sequoias from 1863 to 1910, we\r\nobtain the results shown in Table 3. The trees of Section A of the table\r\ngrew in moderately dry locations although the soil was fairly deep, a\r\ncondition which seems to be essential to sequoias. In this case, as in\r\nall the others, the rainfall is reckoned from July to June, which\r\npractically means from October to May, since there is almost no summer\r\nrain. Thus the tree growth in 1861 is compared with the rainfall of the\r\npreceding rainy season, 1860-1861, or of several preceding rainy seasons\r\nas the table indicates.\r\n\r\n   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n   |                            TABLE 3                                |\r\n   |                                                                   |\r\n   |         CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS BETWEEN RAINFALL AND             |\r\n   |              GROWTH OF SEQUOIAS IN CALIFORNIA[26]                 |\r\n   |                                                                   |\r\n   |     (_r_) = _Correlation coefficient_                             |\r\n   |     (_e_) = _Probable error_                                      |\r\n   | (_r_/_e_) = _Ratio of coefficient to probable error_              |\r\n   |                                                                   |\r\n   | A.

The roots of the sequoias\r\nprobably penetrate so deeply that the rain and melted snow of the spring\r\nmonths do not sink down rapidly enough to influence the trees before the\r\ngrowing season comes to an end. The precipitation of two preceding\r\nseasons, however, has some effect on the trees, as appears in the second\r\nline of Section A, where the correlation coefficient is +0.288, or 3.2\r\ntimes the probable error. When the rainfall of three seasons is taken\r\ninto account the coefficient rises to +0.570, or 8.7 times the probable\r\nerror, while with four years of rainfall the coefficient begins to fall\r\noff. Thus the growth of these eighteen sequoias on relatively dry slopes\r\nappears to have depended chiefly on the rainfall of the second and third\r\npreceding rainy seasons. The growth in 1900, for example, depended\r\nlargely on the rainfall in the rainy seasons of 1897-1898 and 1898-1899.\r\n\r\nSection B of the table shows that with 112 trees, growing chiefly in\r\nmoist depressions where the water supply is at a maximum, the\r\ncorrelation between growth and rainfall, +0.577 for ten years' rainfall,\r\nis even higher than with the dry trees. The seepage of the underground\r\nwater is so slow that not until four years' rainfall is taken into\r\naccount is the correlation coefficient more than four times the probable\r\nerror. When only the trees growing in moist locations are employed, the\r\ncoefficient between tree growth and the rainfall for ten years rises to\r\nthe high figure of +0.605, or 9.8 times the probable error, as appears\r\nin Section C. These figures, as well as many others not here published,\r\nmake it clear that the curve of sequoia growth from 1861 to 1910 affords\r\na fairly close indication of the rainfall at Sacramento, provided\r\nallowance be made for a delay of three to ten years due to the fact that\r\nthe moisture in the soil gradually seeps down the mountain-sides and\r\nonly reaches the sequoias after a considerable interval.\r\n\r\nIf a rainfall record were available for the place where the trees\r\nactually grow, the relationship would probably be still closer.\r\n\r\nThe record at Fresno, for example, bears out this conclusion so far as\r\nit goes. But as Fresno lies at a low altitude and its rainfall is of\r\nessentially the Sacramento type, its short record is of less value than\r\nthat of Sacramento. The only rainfall records among the Sierras at high\r\nlevels, where the rainfall and temperature are approximately like those\r\nof the sequoia region, are found along the main line of the Southern\r\nPacific railroad. This runs from Oakland northeastward seventy miles\r\nacross the open plain to Sacramento, then another seventy miles, as the\r\ncrow flies, through Colfax and over a high pass in the Sierras at\r\nSummit, next twenty miles or so down through Truckee to Boca, on the\r\nedge of the inland basin of Nevada, and on northeastward another 160\r\nmiles to Winnemucca, where it turns east toward Ogden and Salt Lake\r\nCity. Section D of Table 3 shows the correlation coefficients between\r\nthe rainfall along the railroad and the growth of the sequoias. At\r\nSacramento, which lies fairly open to winds from the Pacific and thus\r\nrepresents the general climate of central California, the coefficient is\r\nnearly five times the probable error, thus indicating a real relation to\r\nsequoia growth. Then among the foothills of the Sierras at Colfax, the\r\ncoefficient drops till it is scarcely larger than the probable error. It\r\nrises rapidly, however, as one advances among the mountains, until at\r\nBoca it attains the high figure of +0.604 or eight times the probable\r\nerror, and continues high in the dry area farther east. In other words\r\nthe growth of the sequoias is a good indication of the rainfall where\r\nthe trees grow and in the dry region farther east.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the degree to which the sequoia record represents\r\nthe rainfall of other regions, let us select Jerusalem for comparison.\r\nThe reasons for this selection are that Jerusalem furnishes the only\r\navailable record that satisfies the following necessary conditions: (1)\r\nits record is long enough to be important; (2) it is located fairly near\r\nthe latitude of the sequoias, 32 deg.N versus 37 deg.N; (3) it is located in a\r\nsimilar type of climate with winter rains and a long dry summer; (4) it\r\nlies well above sea level (2500 feet) and somewhat back from the\r\nseacoast, thus approximating although by no means duplicating the\r\ncondition of the sequoias; and (5) it lies in a region where the\r\nevidence of climatic changes during historic times is strongest. The\r\nideal place for comparison would be the valley in which grow the cedars\r\nof Lebanon. Those trees resemble the sequoias to an extraordinary\r\ndegree, not only in their location, but in their great age. Some day it\r\nwill be most interesting to compare the growth of these two famous\r\ngroups of old trees.\r\n\r\n   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n   |                            TABLE 4                                |\r\n   |                                                                   |\r\n   |                CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS BETWEEN                   |\r\n   |                 RAINFALL RECORDS IN CALIFORNIA                    |\r\n   |                        AND JERUSALEM                              |\r\n   |                                                                   |\r\n   |     (_r_) = _Correlation coefficient_                             |\r\n   |     (_e_) = _Probable error_                                      |\r\n   | (_r_/_e_) = _Ratio of coefficient to probable error_              |\r\n   |                                                                   |\r\n   | A.

They are so high and so\r\nconsistent that they scarcely leave room for doubt that where a hundred\r\nor more sequoias are employed, as in Fig. 5, their curve of growth\r\naffords a good indication of the fluctuations of climate in western\r\nAsia. The high coefficient for the eleven trees measured by Douglass\r\nsuggests that where the number of trees falls as low as ten, as in the\r\npart of Fig. 4 from 710 to 840 B. C., the relation between tree growth\r\nand rainfall is still close even when only one year's growth is\r\nconsidered. Where the unit is ten years of growth, as in Figs. 4 and 5,\r\nthe accuracy of the tree curve as a measure of rainfall is much greater\r\nthan when a single year is used as in Table 4. When the unit is raised\r\nto thirty years, as in the smoothed part of Fig. 4 previous to\r\n240 B. C., even four trees, as from 960 to 1070, probably give a fair\r\napproximation to the general changes in rainfall, while a single tree\r\nprior to 1110 B. C. gives a rough indication.\r\n\r\nTable 4 shows a peculiar feature in the fact that the correlations of\r\nSection A between tree growth and the rainfall of Jerusalem are\r\ndecidedly higher than those between the rainfall in the two regions.\r\nOnly at Sacramento and Boca are the rainfall coefficients high enough to\r\nbe conclusive. This, however, is not surprising, for even between\r\nSacramento and San Bernardino, only 400 miles apart, the correlation\r\ncoefficient for the rainfall by three-year periods is only 10.7 times\r\nthe probable error, as appears in Section C of Table 4, while between\r\nSan Bernardino and Winnemucca 500 miles away, the corresponding figure\r\ndrops to 2.8. It must be remembered that in some respects the growth of\r\nthe sequoias is a much better record of rainfall than are the records\r\nkept by man. The human record is based on the amount of water caught by\r\na little gauge a few inches in diameter. Every gust of wind detracts\r\nfrom the accuracy of the record; a mile away the rainfall may be double\r\nwhat it is at the gauge. Each sequoia, on the other hand, draws its\r\nmoisture from an area thousands of times as large as a rain gauge.\r\nMoreover, the trees on which Figs. 4 and 5 are based were scattered over\r\nan area fifty miles long and several hundred square miles in extent.\r\nHence they represent the summation of the rainfall over an area millions\r\nof times as large as that of a rain gauge. This fact and the large\r\ncorrelation coefficients between sequoia growth and Jerusalem rainfall\r\nshould be considered in connection with the fact that all the\r\ncoefficients between the rainfall of California and Nevada and that of\r\nJerusalem are positive. If full records of the complete rainfall of\r\nCalifornia and Nevada on the one hand and of the eastern Mediterranean\r\nregion on the other were available for a long period, they would\r\nprobably agree closely.\r\n\r\nJust how widely the sequoias can be used as a measure of the climate of\r\nthe past is not yet certain. In some regions, as will shortly be\r\nexplained, the climatic changes seem to have been of an opposite\r\ncharacter from those of California. In others the Californian or eastern\r\nMediterranean type of change seems sometimes to prevail but is not\r\nalways evident. For example, at Malta the rainfall today shows a\r\ndistinct relation to that of Jerusalem and to the growth of the\r\nsequoias. But the correlation coefficient between the rainfall of\r\neight-year periods at Naples, a little farther north, and the growth of\r\nthe sequoias at the end of the periods is -0.132, or only 1.4 times the\r\nprobable error and much too small to be significant. This is in harmony\r\nwith the fact that although Naples has summer droughts, they are not so\r\npronounced as in California and Palestine, and the prevalence of storms\r\nis much greater. Jerusalem receives only 8 per cent of its rain in the\r\nseven months from April to October, and Sacramento 13, while Malta\r\nreceives 31 per cent and Naples 43. Nevertheless, there is some evidence\r\nthat in the past the climatic fluctuations of southern Italy followed\r\nnearly the same course as those of California and Palestine. This\r\napparent discrepancy seems to be explained by our previous conclusion\r\nthat changes of climate are due largely to a shifting of storm tracks.\r\nWhen sunspots are numerous the storms which now prevail in northern\r\nItaly seem to be shifted southward and traverse the Mediterranean to\r\nPalestine just as similar storms are shifted southward in the United\r\nStates. This perhaps accounts for the agreement between the sequoia\r\ncurve and the agricultural and social history of Rome from about\r\n400 B. C. to 100 A. D., as explained in _World Power and Evolution_. For\r\nour present purposes, however, the main point is that since rainfall\r\nrecords have been kept the fluctuations of climate indicated by the\r\ngrowth of the sequoias have agreed closely with fluctuations in the\r\nrainfall of the eastern Mediterranean region. Presumably the same was\r\ntrue in the past. In that case, the sequoia curve not only is a good\r\nindication of climatic changes or pulsations in regions of similar\r\nclimate, but may serve as a guide to coincident but different changes in\r\nregions of other types.\r\n\r\nAn enormous body of other evidence points to the same conclusion. It\r\nindicates that while the average climate of the present is drier than\r\nthat of the past in regions having the Mediterranean type of winter\r\nrains and summer droughts, there have been pronounced pulsations during\r\nhistoric times so that at certain times there has actually been greater\r\naridity than at present. This conclusion is so important that it seems\r\nadvisable to examine the only important arguments that have been raised\r\nagainst it, especially against the idea that the general rainfall of the\r\neastern Mediterranean was greater in the historic past than at present.\r\nThe first objection is the unquestionable fact that droughts and famines\r\nhave occurred at periods which seem on other evidence to have been\r\nmoister than the present. This argument has been much used, but it seems\r\nto have little force. If the rainfall of a given region averages thirty\r\ninches and varies from fifteen to forty-five, a famine will ensue if the\r\nrainfall drops for a few years to the lower limit and does not rise much\r\nabove twenty for a few years. If the climate of the place changes during\r\nthe course of centuries, so that the rainfall averages only twenty\r\ninches, and ranges from seven to thirty-five, famine will again ensue if\r\nthe rainfall remains near ten inches for a few years. The ravages of the\r\nfirst famine might be as bad as those of the second. They might even be\r\nworse, because when the rainfall is larger the population is likely to\r\nbe greater and the distress due to scarcity of food would affect a\r\nlarger number of people. Hence historic records of famines and droughts\r\ndo not indicate that the climate was either drier or moister than at\r\npresent. They merely show that at the time in question the climate was\r\ndrier than the normal for that particular period.\r\n\r\nThe second objection is that deserts existed in the past much as at\r\npresent. This is not a real objection, however, for, as we shall see\r\nmore fully, some parts of the world suffer one kind of change and others\r\nquite the opposite. Moreover, deserts have always existed, and when we\r\ntalk of a change in their climate we merely mean that their boundaries\r\nhave shifted. A concrete example of the mistaken use of ancient dryness\r\nas proof of climatic uniformity is illustrated by the march of Alexander\r\nfrom India to Mesopotamia. Hedin gives an excellent presentation of the\r\ncase in the second volume of his _Overland to India_. He shows\r\nconclusively that Alexander's army suffered terribly from lack of water\r\nand provisions. This certainly proves that the climate was dry, but it\r\nby no means indicates that there has been no change from the past to the\r\npresent. We do not know whether Alexander's march took place during an\r\nespecially dry or an especially wet year. In a desert region like\r\nMakran, in southern Persia and Beluchistan, where the chief difficulties\r\noccurred, the rainfall varies greatly from year to year. We have no\r\nrecords from Makran, but the conditions there are closely similar to\r\nthose of southern Arizona and New Mexico. In 1885 and 1905 the rainfall\r\nfor five stations in that region was as follows:\r\n\r\n   +------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n   |                                                            |\r\n   |                                            _Mean rainfall  |\r\n   |                                            during period   |\r\n   |                        _1885_    _1905_    since           |\r\n   |                                            observations    |\r\n   |                                            began_          |\r\n   | Yuma, Arizona,          2.72     11.41        3.13         |\r\n   | Phoenix, Arizona,       3.77     19.73        7.27         |\r\n   | Tucson, Arizona,        5.26     24.17       11.66         |\r\n   | Lordsburg, New Mexico,  3.99     19.50        8.62         |\r\n   | El Paso, Texas (on New                                     |\r\n   |   Mexico border),       7.31     17.80        9.06         |\r\n   |                         ----     -----       -----         |\r\n   | Average,                4.61     18.52        7.95         |\r\n   |                                                            |\r\n   +------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThese stations are distributed over an area nearly 500 miles east and\r\nwest. Manifestly a traveler who spent the year 1885 in that region would\r\nhave had much more difficulty in finding water and forage than one who\r\ntraveled in the same places in 1905. During 1885 the rainfall was 42 per\r\ncent less than the average, and during 1905 it was 134 per cent more\r\nthan the average. Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that the\r\naverage rainfall of southeastern Persia is six inches today and was ten\r\ninches in the days of Alexander. If the rainfall from year to year\r\nvaried as much in the past in Persia as it does now in New Mexico and\r\nArizona, the rainfall during an ancient dry year, corresponding in\r\ncharacter to 1885, would have been about 5.75 inches. On the other hand,\r\nif we suppose that the rainfall then averaged less than at present,--let\r\nus say four inches,--a wet year corresponding to 1905 in the American\r\ndeserts might have had a rainfall of about ten inches. This being the\r\ncase, it is clear that our estimate of what Alexander's march shows as\r\nto climate must depend largely on whether 325 B. C. was a wet year or a\r\ndry year. Inasmuch as we know nothing about this, we must fall back on\r\nthe fact that a large army accomplished a journey in a place where today\r\neven a small caravan usually finds great difficulty in procuring forage\r\nand water. Moreover, elephants were taken 180 miles across what is now\r\nan almost waterless desert, and yet the old historians make no comment\r\non such a feat which today would be practically impossible. These things\r\nseem more in harmony with a change of climate than with uniformity.\r\nNevertheless, it is not safe to place much reliance on them except when\r\nthey are taken in conjunction with other evidence, such as the numerous\r\nruins, which show that Makran was once far more densely populated than\r\nnow seems possible. Taken by itself, such incidents as Alexander's march\r\ncannot safely be used either as an argument for or against changes of\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThe third and strongest objection to any hypothesis of climatic changes\r\nduring historic times is based on vegetation. The whole question is\r\nadmirably set forth by J. W. Gregory,[28] who gives not only his own\r\nresults, but those of the ablest scholars who have preceded him. His\r\nconclusions are important because they represent one of the few cases\r\nwhere a definite statistical attempt has been made to prove the exact\r\ncondition of the climate of the past. After stating various less\r\nimportant reasons for believing that the climate of Palestine has not\r\nchanged, he discusses vegetation. The following quotation indicates his\r\nline of thought. A sentence near the beginning is italicized in order to\r\ncall attention to the importance which Gregory and others lay on this\r\nparticular kind of evidence:\r\n\r\n    Some more certain test is necessary than the general conclusions\r\n    which can be based upon the historical and geographical evidence of\r\n    the Bible. In the absence of rain gauge and thermometric records,\r\n    _the most precise test of climate is given by the vegetation; and\r\n    fortunately the palm affords a very delicate test of the past\r\n    climate of Palestine and the eastern Mediterranean_.... The date\r\n    palm has three limits of growth which are determined by temperature;\r\n    thus it does not reach full maturity or produce ripe fruit of good\r\n    quality below the mean annual temperature of 69 deg.F. The isothermal of\r\n    69 deg. crosses southern Algeria near Biskra; it touches the northern\r\n    coasts of Cyrenaica near Derna and passes Egypt near the mouth of\r\n    the Nile, and then bends northward along the coast lands of\r\n    Palestine.\r\n\r\n    To the north of this line the date palm grows and produces fruit,\r\n    which only ripens occasionally, and its quality deteriorates as the\r\n    temperature falls below 69 deg.. Between the isotherms of 68 deg. and 64 deg.,\r\n    limits which include northern Algeria, most of Sicily, Malta, the\r\n    southern parts of Greece and northern Syria, the dates produced are\r\n    so unripe that they are not edible. In the next cooler zone, north\r\n    of the isotherm of 62 deg., which enters Europe in southwestern\r\n    Portugal, passes through Sardinia, enters Italy near Naples, crosses\r\n    northern Greece and Asia Minor to the east of Smyrna, the date palm\r\n    is grown only for its foliage, since it does not fruit.\r\n\r\n    Hence at Benghazi, on the north African coast, the date palm is\r\n    fertile, but produces fruit of poor quality. In Sicily and at\r\n    Algiers the fruit ripens occasionally and at Rome and Nice the palm\r\n    is grown only as an ornamental tree.\r\n\r\n    The date palm therefore affords a test of variations in mean annual\r\n    temperature of three grades between 62 deg. and 69 deg..\r\n\r\n    This test shows that the mean annual temperature of Palestine has\r\n    not altered since Old Testament times. The palm tree now grows dates\r\n    on the coast of Palestine and in the deep depression around the Dead\r\n    Sea, but it does not produce fruit on the highlands of Judea. Its\r\n    distribution in ancient times, as far as we can judge from the\r\n    Bible, was exactly the same. It grew at \"Jericho, the city of palm\r\n    trees\" (Deut. xxxiv: 3 and 2 Chron. xxviii: 15), and at Engedi, on\r\n    the western shore of the Dead Sea (2 Chron. xx: 2; Sirach xxiv: 14);\r\n    and though the palm does not still live at Jericho--the last\r\n    apparently died in 1838--its disappearance must be due to neglect,\r\n    for the only climatic change that would explain it would be an\r\n    increase in cold or moisture. In olden times the date palm certainly\r\n    grew on the highlands of Palestine; but apparently it never produced\r\n    fruit there, for the Bible references to the palm are to its beauty\r\n    and erect growth: \"The righteous shall flourish like the palm\" (Ps.\r\n    xcii: 12); \"They are upright as the palm tree\" (Jer. x: 5); \"Thy\r\n    stature is like to a palm tree\" (Cant. vii: 7). It is used as a\r\n    symbol of victory (Rev. vii: 9), but never praised as a source of\r\n    food.\r\n\r\n    Dates are not once referred to in the text of the Bible, but\r\n    according to the marginal notes the word translated \"honey\" in\r\n    2 Chron. xxxi: 5 may mean dates....\r\n\r\n    It appears, therefore, that the date palm had essentially the same\r\n    distribution in Palestine in Old Testament times as it has now; and\r\n    hence we may infer that the mean temperature was then the same as\r\n    now. If the climate had been moister and cooler, the date could not\r\n    have flourished at Jericho. If it had been warmer, the palms would\r\n    have grown freely at higher levels and Jericho would not have held\r\n    its distinction as _the_ city of palm trees.[29]\r\n\r\nIn the main Gregory's conclusions seem to be well grounded, although\r\neven according to his data a change of 2 deg. or 3 deg. in mean temperature\r\nwould be perfectly feasible. It will be noticed, however, that they\r\napply to temperature and not to rainfall. They merely prove that two\r\nthousand years ago the mean temperature of Palestine and the neighboring\r\nregions was not appreciably different from what it is today. This,\r\nhowever, is in no sense out of harmony with the hypothesis of climatic\r\npulsations. Students of glaciation believe that during the last glacial\r\nepoch the mean temperature of the earth as a whole was only 5 deg. or 6 deg.C.\r\nlower than at present. If the difference between the climate of today\r\nand of the time of Christ is a tenth as great as the difference between\r\nthe climate of today and that which prevailed at the culmination of the\r\nlast glacial epoch, the change in two thousand years has been of large\r\ndimensions. Yet this would require a rise of only half a degree\r\nCentigrade in the mean temperature of Palestine. Manifestly, so slight a\r\nchange would scarcely be detectable in the vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe slightness of changes in mean temperature as compared with changes\r\nin rainfall may be judged from a comparison of wet and dry years in\r\nvarious regions. For example, at Berlin between 1866 and 1905 the ten\r\nmost rainy years had an average precipitation of 670 mm. and a mean\r\ntemperature of 9.15 deg.C. On the other hand, the ten years of least\r\nrainfall had an average of 483 mm. and a mean temperature of 9.35 deg.. In\r\nother words, a difference of 137 mm., or 39 per cent, in rainfall was\r\naccompanied by a difference of only 0.2 deg.C. in temperature. Such\r\ncontrasts between the variability of mean rainfall and mean temperature\r\nare observable not only when individual years are selected, but when\r\nmuch longer periods are taken. For instance, in the western Gulf region\r\nof the United States the two inland stations of Vicksburg, Mississippi,\r\nand Shreveport, Louisiana, and the two maritime stations of New Orleans,\r\nLouisiana, and Galveston, Texas, lie at the margins of an area about 400\r\nmiles long. During the ten years from 1875 to 1884 their rainfall\r\naveraged 59.4 inches,[30] while during the ten years from 1890 to 1899\r\nit averaged only 42.4 inches. Even in a region so well watered as the\r\nGulf States, such a change--40 per cent more in the first decade than in\r\nthe second--is important, and in drier regions it would have a great\r\neffect on habitability. Yet in spite of the magnitude of the change the\r\nmean temperature was not appreciably different, the average for the four\r\nstations being 67.36 deg.F. during the more rainy decade and 66.94 deg.F. during\r\nthe less rainy decade--a difference of only 0.42 deg.F. It is worth noticing\r\nthat in this case the wetter period was also the warmer, whereas in\r\nBerlin it was the cooler. This is probably because a large part of the\r\nmoisture of the Gulf States is brought by winds having a southerly\r\ncomponent. Similar relationships are apparent in other places. We select\r\nJerusalem because we have been discussing Palestine. At the time of\r\nwriting, the data available in the _Quarterly Journal of the Palestine\r\nExploration Fund_ cover the years from 1882-1899 and 1903-1909. Among\r\nthese twenty-five years the thirteen which had most rain had an average\r\nof 34.1 inches and a temperature of 62.04 deg.F. The twelve with least rain\r\nhad 24.4 inches and a temperature of 62.44 deg.. A difference of 40 per cent\r\nin rainfall was accompanied by a difference of only 0.4 deg.F. in\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe facts set forth in the preceding paragraphs seem to show that\r\nextensive changes in precipitation and storminess can take place without\r\nappreciable changes of mean temperature. If such changed conditions can\r\npersist for ten years, as in one of our examples, there is no logical\r\nreason why they cannot persist for a hundred or a thousand. The evidence\r\nof changes in climate during the historic period seems to suggest\r\nchanges in precipitation much more than in temperature. Hence the\r\nstrongest of all the arguments against historic changes of climate seems\r\nto be of relatively little weight, and the pulsatory hypothesis seems to\r\nbe in accord with all the known facts.\r\n\r\nBefore the true nature of climatic changes, whether historic or\r\ngeologic, can be rightly understood, another point needs emphasis. When\r\nthe pulsatory hypothesis was first framed, it fell into the same error\r\nas the hypotheses of uniformity and of progressive change--that is, the\r\nassumption was made that the whole world is either growing drier or\r\nmoister with each pulsation. A study of the ruins of Yucatan, in 1912,\r\nand of Guatemala, in 1913, as is explained in _The Climatic Factor_, has\r\nled to the conclusion that the climate of those regions has changed in\r\nthe opposite way from the changes which appear to have taken place in\r\nthe desert regions farther south. These Maya ruins in Central America\r\nare in many cases located in regions of such heavy rainfall, such dense\r\nforests, and such malignant fevers that habitation is now practically\r\nimpossible. The land cannot be cultivated except in especially favorable\r\nplaces. The people are terribly weakened by disease and are among the\r\nlowest in Central America. Only a hundred miles from the unhealthful\r\nforests we find healthful areas, such as the coasts of Yucatan and the\r\nplateau of Guatemala. Here the vast majority of the population is\r\ngathered, the large towns are located, and the only progressive people\r\nare found. Nevertheless, in the past the region of the forests was the\r\nhome of by far the most progressive people who are ever known to have\r\nlived in America previous to the days of Columbus. They alone brought to\r\nhigh perfection the art of sculpture; they were the only American people\r\nwho invented the art of writing. It seems scarcely credible that such a\r\npeople would have lived in the worst possible habitat when far more\r\nfavored regions were close at hand. Therefore it seems as if the climate\r\nof eastern Guatemala and Yucatan must have been relatively dry at some\r\npast time. The Maya chronology and traditions indicate that this was\r\nprobably at the same time when moister conditions apparently prevailed\r\nin the subarid or desert portions of the United States and Asia. Fig. 3\r\nshows that today at times of many sunspots there is a similar opposition\r\nbetween a tendency toward storminess and rain in subtropical regions and\r\ntoward aridity in low latitudes near the heat equator.\r\n\r\nThus our final conclusion is that during historic times there have been\r\npulsatory changes of climate. These changes have been of the same type\r\nin regions having similar kinds of climate, but of different and\r\nsometimes opposite types in places having diverse climates. As to the\r\ncause of the pulsations, they cannot have been due to the precession of\r\nthe equinoxes nor apparently to any allied astronomical cause, for the\r\ntime intervals are too short and too irregular. They cannot have been\r\ndue to changes in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\r\nfor not even the strongest believers in the climatic efficacy of that\r\ngas hold that its amount could fluctuate in any such violent way as\r\nwould be necessary to explain the pulsations shown in the California\r\ncurve of tree growth. Volcanic activity seems more probable as at least\r\na partial cause, and it would be worth while to investigate the matter\r\nmore fully. Nevertheless, it can apparently be only a minor cause. In\r\nthe first place, the main effect of a cloud of dust is to alter the\r\ntemperature, but Gregory's summary of the palm and the vine shows that\r\nvariations in temperature are apparently of very slight importance\r\nduring historic times. Again, ruins on the bottoms of enclosed salt\r\nlakes, old beaches now under the water, and signs of irrigation ditches\r\nwhere none are now needed indicate a climate drier than the present.\r\nVolcanic dust, however, cannot account for such a condition, for at\r\npresent the air seems to be practically free from such dust for long\r\nperiods. Thus we now experience the greatest extreme which the volcanic\r\nhypothesis permits in one direction, but there have been greater\r\nextremes in the same direction. The thermal solar hypothesis is likewise\r\nunable to explain the observed phenomena, for neither it nor the\r\nvolcanic hypothesis offers any explanation of why the climate varies in\r\none way in Mediterranean climates and in an opposite way in regions near\r\nthe heat equator.\r\n\r\nThis leaves the cyclonic hypothesis. It seems to fit the facts, for\r\nvariations in cyclonic storms cause some regions to be moister and\r\nothers drier than usual. At the same time the variations in temperature\r\nare slight, and are apparently different in different regions, some\r\nplaces growing warm when others grow cool. In the next chapter we shall\r\nstudy this matter more fully, for it can best be appreciated by\r\nexamining the course of events in a specific century.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Much of this chapter is taken from The Solar Hypothesis of\r\nClimatic Changes; Bull.

We will\r\ntake the fourteenth century of the Christian era, especially the first\r\nhalf. This period is chosen because it is the last and hence the best\r\nknown of the times when the climate of the earth seems to have taken a\r\nconsiderable swing toward the conditions which now prevail when the sun\r\nis most active, and which, if intensified, would apparently lead to\r\nglaciation. It has already been discussed in _World Power and\r\nEvolution_, but its importance and the fact that new evidence is\r\nconstantly coming to light warrant a fuller discussion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with Europe; according to the careful account of Pettersson[31]\r\nthe fourteenth century shows\r\n\r\n    a record of extreme climatic variations. In the cold winters the\r\n    rivers Rhine, Danube, Thames, and Po were frozen for weeks and\r\n    months. On these cold winters there followed violent floods, so that\r\n    the rivers mentioned inundated their valleys. Such floods are\r\n    recorded in 55 summers in the 14th century. There is, of course,\r\n    nothing astonishing in the fact that the inundations of the great\r\n    rivers of Europe were more devastating 600 to 700 years ago than in\r\n    our days, when the flow of the rivers has been regulated by canals,\r\n    locks, etc.; but still the inundations in the 13th and 14th\r\n    centuries must have surpassed everything of that kind which has\r\n    occurred since then. In 1342 the waters of the Rhine rose so high\r\n    that they inundated the city of Mayence and the Cathedral \"usque ad\r\n    cingulum hominis.\" The walls of Cologne were flooded so that they\r\n    could be passed by boats in July. This occurred also in 1374 in the\r\n    midst of the month of February, which is of course an unusual season\r\n    for disasters of the kind. Again in other years the drought was so\r\n    intense that the same rivers, the Danube, Rhine, and others, nearly\r\n    dried up, and the Rhine could be forded at Cologne. This happened at\r\n    least twice in the same century. There is one exceptional summer of\r\n    such evil record that centuries afterwards it was spoken of as \"the\r\n    old hot summer of 1357.\"\r\n\r\nPettersson goes on to speak of two oceanic phenomena on which the old\r\nchronicles lay greater stress than on all others:\r\n\r\n    The first [is] the great storm-floods on the coast of the North Sea\r\n    and the Baltic, which occurred so frequently that not less than\r\n    nineteen floods of a destructiveness unparalleled in later times are\r\n    recorded from the 14th century. The coastline of the North Sea was\r\n    completely altered by these floods. Thus on January 16, 1300, half\r\n    of the island Heligoland and many other islands were engulfed by the\r\n    sea. The same fate overtook the island of Borkum, torn into several\r\n    islands by the storm-flood of January 16, which remoulded the\r\n    Frisian Islands into their present shape, when also Wendingstadt, on\r\n    the island of Sylt, and Thiryu parishes were engulfed. This flood is\r\n    known under the name of \"the great man-drowning.\" The coasts of the\r\n    Baltic also were exposed to storm-floods of unparalleled violence.\r\n    On November 1, 1304, the island of Ruden was torn asunder from Rugen\r\n    by the force of the waves. Time does not allow me to dwell upon\r\n    individual disasters of this kind, but it will be well to note that\r\n    of the nineteen great floods on record eighteen occurred in the cold\r\n    season between the autumnal and vernal equinoxes.\r\n\r\n    The second remarkable phenomenon mentioned by the chronicles is the\r\n    freezing of the entire Baltic, which occurred many times during the\r\n    cold winters of these centuries. On such occasions it was possible\r\n    to travel with carriages over the ice from Sweden to Bornholm and\r\n    from Denmark to the German coast (Lubeck), and in some cases even\r\n    from Gotland to the coast of Estland.\r\n\r\nNorlind[32] says that \"the only authentic accounts\" of the complete\r\nfreezing of the Baltic in the neighborhood of the Kattegat are in the\r\nyears 1296, 1306, 1323, and 1408. Of these 1296 is \"much the most\r\nuncertain,\" while 1323 was the coldest year ever recorded, as appears\r\nfrom the fact that horses and sleighs crossed regularly from Sweden to\r\nGermany on the ice.\r\n\r\nNot only central Europe and the shores of the North Sea were marked by\r\nclimatic stress during the fourteenth century, but Scandinavia also\r\nsuffered. As Pettersson puts it:\r\n\r\n    On examining the historic (data) from the last centuries of the\r\n    Middle Ages, Dr. Bull of Christiania has come to the conclusion that\r\n    the decay of the Norwegian kingdom was not so much a consequence of\r\n    the political conditions at that time, as of the frequent failures\r\n    of the harvest so that corn [wheat] for bread had to be imported\r\n    from Luebeck, Rostock, Wismar and so forth. The Hansa Union undertook\r\n    the importation and obtained political power by its economic\r\n    influence. The Norwegian land-owners were forced to lower their\r\n    rents. The population decreased and became impoverished. The revenue\r\n    sank 60 to 70 per cent. Even the income from Church property\r\n    decreased. In 1367 corn was imported from Luebeck to a value of\r\n    one-half million kroner. The trade balance inclined to the\r\n    disadvantage of Norway whose sole article of export at that time\r\n    was dried fish. (The production of fish increased enormously in\r\n    the Baltic regions off south Sweden because of the same changes\r\n    which were influencing the lands, but this did not benefit\r\n    Norway.) Dr. Bull draws a comparison with the conditions described\r\n    in the Sagas when Nordland [at the Arctic Circle] produced enough\r\n    corn to feed the inhabitants of the country. At the time of\r\n    Asbjoern Selsbane the chieftains in Trondhenaes [still farther north\r\n    in latitude 69 deg.] grew so much corn that they did not need to go\r\n    southward to buy corn unless three successive years of dearth had\r\n    occurred. The province of Trondheim exported wheat to Iceland and\r\n    so forth. Probably the turbulent political state of Scandinavia at\r\n    the end of the Middle Ages was in a great measure due to\r\n    unfavorable climatic conditions, which lowered the standard of\r\n    life, and not entirely to misgovernment and political strife as\r\n    has hitherto been taken for granted.\r\n\r\nDuring this same unfortunate first half of the fourteenth century\r\nEngland also suffered from conditions which, if sufficiently\r\nintensified, might be those of a glacial period. According to Thorwald\r\nRogers[33] the severest famine ever experienced in England was that of\r\n1315-1316, and the next worst was in 1321. In fact, from 1308 to 1322\r\ngreat scarcity of food prevailed most of the time. Other famines of less\r\nseverity occurred in 1351 and 1369. \"The same cause was at work in all\r\nthese cases,\" says Rogers, \"incessant rain, and cold, stormy summers. It\r\nis said that the inclemency of the seasons affected the cattle, and that\r\nnumbers perished from disease and want.\" After the bad harvest of 1315\r\nthe price of wheat, which was already high, rose rapidly, and in May,\r\n1316, was about five times the average. For a year or more thereafter it\r\nremained at three or four times the ordinary level. The severity of the\r\nfamine may be judged from the fact that previous to the Great War the\r\nmost notable scarcity of wheat in modern England and the highest\r\nrelative price was in December, 1800. At that time wheat cost nearly\r\nthree times the usual amount, instead of five as in 1316. During the\r\nfamine of the early fourteenth century \"it is said that people were\r\nreduced to subsist upon roots, upon horses and dogs, and stories are\r\ntold of even more terrible acts by reason of the extreme famine.\" The\r\nnumber of deaths was so great that the price of labor suffered a\r\npermanent rise of at least 10 per cent. There simply were not people\r\nenough left among the peasants to do the work demanded by the more\r\nprosperous class who had not suffered so much.\r\n\r\nAfter the famine came drought. The year 1325 appears to have been\r\npeculiarly dry, and 1331, 1344, 1362, 1374, and 1377 were also dry. In\r\ngeneral these conditions do little harm in England. They are of interest\r\nchiefly as showing how excessive rain and drought are apt to succeed one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThese facts regarding northern and central Europe during the fourteenth\r\ncentury are particularly significant when compared with the conclusions\r\nwhich we have drawn in _Earth and Sun_ from the growth of trees in\r\nGermany and from the distribution of storms. A careful study of all the\r\nfacts shows that we are dealing with two distinct types of phenomena. In\r\nthe first place, the climate of central Europe seems to have been\r\npeculiarly continental during the fourteenth century. The winters were\r\nso cold that the rivers froze, and the summers were so wet that there\r\nwere floods every other year or oftener. This seems to be merely an\r\nintensification of the conditions which prevail at the present time\r\nduring periods of many sunspots, as indicated by the growth of trees at\r\nEberswalde in Germany and by the number of storms in winter as compared\r\nwith summer. The prevalence of droughts, especially in the spring, is\r\nalso not inconsistent with the existence of floods at other seasons, for\r\none of the chief characteristics of a continental climate is that the\r\nvariations from one season to another are more marked than in oceanic\r\nclimates. Even the summer droughts are typically continental, for when\r\ncontinental conditions prevail, the difference between the same season\r\nin different years is extreme, as is well illustrated in Kansas. It must\r\nalways be remembered that what causes famine is not so much absolute\r\ndryness as a temporary diminution of the rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe second type of phenomena is peculiarly oceanic in character. It\r\nconsists of two parts, both of which are precisely what would be\r\nexpected if a highly continental climate prevailed over the land. In the\r\nfirst place, at certain times the cold area of high pressure, which is\r\nthe predominating characteristic of a continent during the winter,\r\napparently spread out over the neighboring oceans. Under such conditions\r\nan inland sea, such as the Baltic, would be frozen, so that horses could\r\ncross the ice even in the Far West. In the second place, because of the\r\nunusually high pressure over the continent, the barometric gradients\r\napparently became intensified. Hence at the margin of the continental\r\nhigh-pressure area the winds were unusually strong and the storms of\r\ncorresponding severity. Some of these storms may have passed entirely\r\nalong oceanic tracks, while others invaded the borders of the land, and\r\ngave rise to the floods and to the wearing away of the coast described\r\nby Pettersson.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the east of Europe, Brueckner's[34] study of the Caspian\r\nSea shows that that region as well as western Europe was subject to\r\ngreat climatic vicissitudes in the first half of the fourteenth century.\r\nIn 1306-1307 the Caspian Sea, after rising rapidly for several years,\r\nstood thirty-seven feet above the present level and it probably rose\r\nstill higher during the succeeding decades. At least it remained at a\r\nhigh level, for Hamdulla, the Persian, tells us that in 1325 a place\r\ncalled Aboskun was under water.[35]\r\n\r\nStill further east the inland lake of Lop Nor also rose at about this\r\ntime. According to a Chinese account the Dragon Town on the shore of Lop\r\nNor was destroyed by a flood. From Himley's translation it appears that\r\nthe level of the lake rose so as to overwhelm the city completely. This\r\nwould necessitate the expansion of the lake to a point eighty miles east\r\nof Lulan, and fully fifty from the present eastern end of the Kara\r\nKoshun marsh. The water would have to rise nearly, or quite, to a strand\r\nwhich is now clearly visible at a height of twelve feet above the modern\r\nlake or marsh.\r\n\r\nIn India the fourteenth century was characterized by what appears to\r\nhave been the most disastrous drought in all history. Apparently the\r\ndecrease in rainfall here was as striking as the increase in other parts\r\nof the world. No statistics are available but we are told that in the\r\ngreat famine which began in 1344 even the Mogul emperor was unable to\r\nobtain the necessaries of life for his household. No rain worth\r\nmentioning fell for years. In some places the famine lasted three or\r\nfour years, and in some twelve, and entire cities were left without an\r\ninhabitant. In a later famine, 1769-1770, which occurred in Bengal\r\nshortly after the foundation of British rule in India, but while the\r\nnative officials were still in power, a third of the population, or ten\r\nout of thirty millions, perished. The famine in the first half of the\r\nfourteenth century seems to have been far worse. These Indian famines\r\nwere apparently due to weak summer monsoons caused presumably by the\r\nfailure of central Asia to warm up as much as usual. The heavier\r\nsnowfall, and the greater cloudiness of the summer there, which probably\r\naccompanied increased storminess, may have been the reason.\r\n\r\nThe New World as well as the Old appears to have been in a state of\r\nclimatic stress during the first half of the fourteenth century.\r\nAccording to Pettersson, Greenland furnishes an example of this. At\r\nfirst the inhabitants of that northland were fairly prosperous and were\r\nable to approach from Iceland without much hindrance from the ice. Today\r\nthe North Atlantic Ocean northeast of Iceland is full of drift ice much\r\nof the time. The border of the ice varies from season to season, but in\r\ngeneral it extends westward from Iceland not far from the Arctic circle\r\nand then follows the coast of Greenland southward to Cape Farewell at\r\nthe southern tip and around to the western side for fifty miles or more.\r\nExcept under exceptional circumstances a ship cannot approach the coast\r\nuntil well northward on the comparatively ice-free west coast. In the\r\nold Sagas, however, nothing is said of ice in this region. The route\r\nfrom Iceland to Greenland is carefully described. In the earliest times\r\nit went from Iceland a trifle north of west so as to approach the coast\r\nof Greenland after as short an ocean passage as possible. Then it went\r\ndown the coast in a region where approach is now practically impossible\r\nbecause of the ice. At that time this coast was icy close to the shore,\r\nbut there is no sign that navigation was rendered difficult as is now\r\nthe case. Today no navigator would think of keeping close inland. The\r\nold route also went _north_ of the island on which Cape Farewell is\r\nlocated, although the narrow channel between the island and the mainland\r\nis now so blocked with ice that no modern vessel has ever penetrated it.\r\nBy the thirteenth century, however, there appears to have been a change.\r\nIn the Kungaspegel or _Kings' Mirror_, written at that time, navigators\r\nare warned not to make the east coast too soon on account of ice, but no\r\nnew route is recommended in the neighborhood of Cape Farewell or\r\nelsewhere. Finally, however, at the end of the fourteenth century,\r\nnearly 150 years after the Kungaspegel, the old sailing route was\r\nabandoned, and ships from Iceland sailed directly southwest to avoid the\r\nice. As Pettersson says:\r\n\r\n    ... At the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth\r\n    century the European civilization in Greenland was wiped out by an\r\n    invasion of the aboriginal population. The colonists in the\r\n    Vesterbygd were driven from their homes and probably migrated to\r\n    America leaving behind their cattle in the fields. So they were\r\n    found by Ivar Bardsson, steward to the Bishop of Gardar, in his\r\n    official journey thither in 1342.\r\n\r\n    The Eskimo invasion must not be regarded as a common raid. It was\r\n    the transmigration of a people, and like other big movements of this\r\n    kind [was] impelled by altered conditions of nature, in this case\r\n    the alterations of climate caused by [or which caused?] the advance\r\n    of the ice. For their hunting and fishing the Eskimos require an at\r\n    least partially open arctic sea. The seal, their principal prey,\r\n    cannot live where the surface of the sea is entirely frozen over.\r\n    The cause of the favorable conditions in the Viking-age was,\r\n    according to my hypothesis, that the ice then melted at a higher\r\n    latitude in the arctic seas.\r\n\r\n    The Eskimos then lived further north in Greenland and North America.\r\n    When the climate deteriorated and the sea which gave them their\r\n    living was closed by ice the Eskimos had to find a more suitable\r\n    neighborhood. This they found in the land colonized by the Norsemen\r\n    whom they attacked and finally annihilated.\r\n\r\nFinally, far to the south in Yucatan the ancient Maya civilization made\r\nits last flickering effort at about this time. Not much is known of this\r\nbut in earlier periods the history of the Mayas seems to have agreed\r\nquite closely with the fluctuations in climate.[36] Among the Mayas, as\r\nwe have seen, relatively dry periods were the times of greatest\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to Fig. 3 once more and compare the climatic conditions\r\nof the fourteenth century with those of periods of increasing rainfall.\r\nSouthern England, Ireland, and Scandinavia, where the crops were ruined\r\nby extensive rain and storms in summer, are places where storminess and\r\nrainfall now increase when sunspots are numerous. Central Europe and the\r\ncoasts of the North Sea, where flood and drought alternated, are regions\r\nwhich now have relatively less rain when sunspots increase than when\r\nthey diminish. However, as appears from the trees measured by Douglass,\r\nthe winters become more continental and hence cooler, thus corresponding\r\nto the cold winters of the fourteenth century when people walked on the\r\nice from Scandinavia to Denmark. When such high pressure prevails in the\r\nwinter, the total rainfall is diminished, but nevertheless the storms\r\nare more severe than usual, especially in the spring. In southeastern\r\nEurope, the part of the area whence the Caspian derives its water,\r\nappears to have less rainfall during times of increasing sunspots than\r\nwhen sunspots are few, but in an equally large area to the south, where\r\nthe mountains are higher and the run-off of the rain is more rapid, the\r\nreverse is the case. This seems to mean that a slight diminution in the\r\nwater poured in by the Volga would be more than compensated by the water\r\nderived from Persia and from the Oxus and Jaxartes rivers, which in the\r\nfourteenth century appear to have filled the Sea of Aral and overflowed\r\nin a large stream to the Caspian. Still farther east in central Asia, so\r\nfar as the records go, most of the country receives more rain when\r\nsunspots are many than when they are few, which would agree with what\r\nhappened when the Dragon Town was inundated. In India, on the contrary,\r\nthere is a large area where the rainfall diminishes at times of many\r\nsunspots, thus agreeing with the terrible famine from which the Moguls\r\nsuffered so severely. In the western hemisphere, Greenland, Arizona, and\r\nCalifornia are all parts of the area where the rain increases with many\r\nsunspots, while Yucatan seems to lie in an area of the opposite type.\r\nThus all the evidence seems to show that at times of climatic stress,\r\nsuch as the fourteenth century, the conditions are essentially the same\r\nas those which now prevail at times of increasing sunspots.\r\n\r\nAs to the number of sunspots, there is little evidence previous to about\r\n1750. Yet that little is both interesting and important. Although\r\nsunspots have been observed with care in Europe only a little more than\r\nthree centuries, the Chinese have records which go back nearly to the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era. Of course the records are far from\r\nperfect, for the work was done by individuals and not by any great\r\norganization which continued the same methods from generation to\r\ngeneration. The mere fact that a good observer happened to use his\r\nsmoked glass to advantage may cause a particular period to appear to\r\nhave an unusual number of spots. On the other hand, the fact that such\r\nan observer finds spots at some times and not at others tends to give a\r\nvaluable check on his results, as does the comparison of one observer's\r\nwork with that of another. Hence, in spite of many and obvious defects,\r\nmost students of the problem agree that the Chinese record possesses\r\nmuch value, and that for a thousand years or more it gives a fairly true\r\nidea of the general aspect of the sun. In the Chinese records the years\r\nwith many spots fall in groups, as would be expected, and are sometimes\r\nseparated by long intervals. Certain centuries appear to have been\r\nmarked by unusual spottedness. The most conspicuous of these is the\r\nfourteenth, when the years 1370 to 1385 were particularly noteworthy,\r\nfor spots large enough to be visible to the naked eye covered the sun\r\nmuch of the time. Hence Wolf,[37] who has made an exhaustive study of\r\nthe matter, concludes that there was an absolute maximum of spots about\r\n1372. While this date is avowedly open to question, the great abundance\r\nof sunspots at that time makes it probable that it cannot be far wrong.\r\nIf this is so, it seems that the great climatic disturbances of which we\r\nhave seen evidence in the fourteenth century occurred at a time when\r\nsunspots were increasing, or at least when solar activity was under some\r\nprofoundly disturbing influence. Thus the evidence seems to show not\r\nmerely that the climate of historic times has been subject to important\r\npulsations, but that those pulsations were magnifications of the little\r\nclimatic changes which now take place in sunspot cycles. The past and\r\nthe present are apparently a unit except as to the intensity of the\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: O.

In\r\nthis chapter and the two that follow, we shall apply this test. Since\r\nmuch more is known about the recent Great Ice Age, or Pleistocene\r\nglaciation, than about the more ancient glaciations, the problems of the\r\nPleistocene will receive especial attention. In the present chapter the\r\noncoming of glaciation and the subsequent disappearance of the ice will\r\nbe outlined in the light of what would be expected according to the\r\nsolar-cyclonic hypothesis. Then in the next chapter several problems of\r\nespecial climatic significance will be considered, such as the\r\nlocalization of ice sheets, the succession of severe glacial and mild\r\ninter-glacial epochs, the sudden commencement of glaciation and the\r\npeculiar variations in the height of the snow line. Other topics to be\r\nconsidered are the occurrence of pluvial or rainy climates in\r\nnon-glaciated regions, and glaciation near sea level in subtropical\r\nlatitudes during the Permian and Proterozoic. Then in Chapter IX we\r\nshall consider the development and distribution of the remarkable\r\ndeposits of wind-blown material known as loess.\r\n\r\nFacts not considered at the time of framing an hypothesis are especially\r\nsignificant in testing it. In this particular case, the cyclonic\r\nhypothesis was framed to explain the historic changes of climate\r\nrevealed by a study of ruins, tree rings, and the terraces of streams\r\nand lakes, without special thought of glaciation or other geologic\r\nchanges. Indeed, the hypothesis had reached nearly its present form\r\nbefore much attention was given to geological phases of the problem.\r\nNevertheless, it appears to meet even this severe test.\r\n\r\nAccording to the solar-cyclonic hypothesis, the Pleistocene glacial\r\nperiod was inaugurated at a time when certain terrestrial conditions\r\ntended to make the earth especially favorable for glaciation. How these\r\nconditions arose will be considered later. Here it is enough to state\r\nwhat they were. Chief among them was the fact that the continents stood\r\nunusually high and were unusually large. This, however, was not the\r\nprimary cause of glaciation, for many of the areas which were soon to be\r\nglaciated were little above sea level. For example, it seems clear that\r\nNew England stood less than a thousand feet higher than now. Indeed,\r\nSalisbury[39] estimates that eastern North America in general stood not\r\nmore than a few hundred feet higher than now, and W. B. Wright[40]\r\nreaches the same conclusion in respect to the British Isles.\r\nNevertheless, widespread lands, even if they are not all high, lead to\r\nclimatic conditions which favor glaciation. For example, enlarged\r\ncontinents cause low temperature in high latitudes because they\r\ninterfere with the ocean currents that carry heat polewards. Such\r\ncontinents also cause relatively cold winters, for lands cool much\r\nsooner than does the ocean. Another result is a diminution of water\r\nvapor, not only because cold air cannot hold much vapor, but also\r\nbecause the oceanic area from which evaporation takes place is reduced\r\nby the emergence of the continents. Again, when the continents are\r\nextensive the amount of carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere probably\r\ndecreases, for the augmented erosion due to uplift exposes much igneous\r\nrock to the air, and weathering consumes the atmospheric carbon dioxide.\r\nWhen the supply of water vapor and of atmospheric carbon dioxide is\r\nsmall, an extreme type of climate usually prevails. The combined result\r\nof all these conditions is that continental emergence causes the climate\r\nto be somewhat cool and to be marked by relatively great contrasts from\r\nseason to season and from latitude to latitude.\r\n\r\nWhen the terrestrial conditions thus permitted glaciation, unusual solar\r\nactivity is supposed to have greatly increased the number and severity\r\nof storms and to have altered their location, just as now happens at\r\ntimes of many sunspots. If such a change in storminess had occurred when\r\nterrestrial conditions were unfavorable for glaciation, as, for example,\r\nwhen the lands were low and there were widespread epicontinental seas in\r\nmiddle and high latitudes, glaciation might not have resulted. In the\r\nPleistocene, however, terrestrial conditions permitted glaciation, and\r\ntherefore the supposed increase in storminess caused great ice sheets.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which prevail at times of increased storminess have been\r\ndiscussed in detail in _Earth and Sun_. Those which apparently brought\r\non glaciation seem to have acted as follows: In the first place the\r\nstorminess lowered the temperature of the earth's surface in several\r\nways. The most important of these was the rapid upward convection in the\r\ncenters of cyclonic storms whereby abundant heat was carried to high\r\nlevels where most of it was radiated away into space. The marked\r\nincrease in the number of tropical cyclones which accompanies increased\r\nsolar activity was probably important in this respect. Such cyclones\r\ncarry vast quantities of heat and moisture out of the tropics. The\r\nmoisture, to be sure, liberates heat upon condensing, but as\r\ncondensation occurs above the earth's surface, much of the heat escapes\r\ninto space. Another reason for low temperature was that under the\r\ninfluence of the supposedly numerous storms of Pleistocene times\r\nevaporation over the oceans must have increased. This is largely because\r\nthe velocity of the winds is relatively great when storms are strong and\r\nsuch winds are powerful agents of evaporation. But evaporation requires\r\nheat, and hence the strong winds lower the temperature.[B]\r\n\r\nThe second great condition which enabled increased storminess to bring\r\non glaciation was the location of the storm tracks. Kullmer's maps, as\r\nillustrated in Fig. 2, suggest that a great increase in solar activity,\r\nsuch as is postulated in the Pleistocene, might shift the main storm\r\ntrack poleward even more than it is shifted by the milder solar changes\r\nduring the twelve-year sunspot cycle. If this is so, the main track\r\nwould tend to cross North America through the middle of Canada instead\r\nof near the southern border. Thus there would be an increase in\r\nprecipitation in about the latitude of the Keewatin and Labradorean\r\ncenters of glaciation. From what is known of storm tracks in Europe, the\r\nmain increase in the intensity of storms would probably center in\r\nScandinavia. Fig. 3 in Chapter V bears this out. That figure, it will be\r\nrecalled, shows what happens to precipitation when solar activity is\r\nincreasing. A high rate of precipitation is especially marked in the\r\nboreal storm track, that is, in the northern United States, southern\r\nCanada, and northwestern Europe.\r\n\r\nAnother important condition in bringing on glaciation would be the fact\r\nthat when storms are numerous the total precipitation appears to\r\nincrease in spite of the slightly lower temperature. This is largely\r\nbecause of the greater evaporation. The excessive evaporation arises\r\npartly from the rapidity of the winds, as already stated, and partly\r\nfrom the fact that in areas where the air is clear the sun would\r\npresumably be able to act more effectively than now. It would do so\r\nbecause at times of abundant sunspots the sun in our own day has a\r\nhigher solar constant than at times of milder activity. Our whole\r\nhypothesis is based on the supposition that what now happens at times of\r\nmany sunspots was intensified in glacial periods.\r\n\r\nA fourth condition which would cause glaciation to result from great\r\nsolar activity would be the fact that the portion of the yearly\r\nprecipitation falling as snow would increase, while the proportion of\r\nrain would diminish in the main storm track. This would arise partly\r\nbecause the storms would be located farther north than now, and partly\r\nbecause of the diminution in temperature due to the increased\r\nconvection. The snow in itself would still further lower the\r\ntemperature, for snow is an excellent reflector of sunlight. The\r\nincreased cloudiness which would accompany the more abundant storms\r\nwould also cause an unusually great reflection of the sunlight and still\r\nfurther lower the temperature. Thus at times of many sunspots a strong\r\ntendency toward the accumulation of snow would arise from the rapid\r\nconvection and consequent low temperature, from the northern location of\r\nstorms, from the increased evaporation and precipitation, from the\r\nlarger percentage of snowy rather than rainy precipitation, and from the\r\ngreat loss of heat due to reflection from clouds and snow.\r\n\r\nIf events at the beginning of the last glacial period took place in\r\naccordance with the cyclonic hypothesis, as outlined above, one of the\r\ninevitable results would be the production of snowfields. The places\r\nwhere snow would accumulate in special quantities would be central\r\nCanada, the Labrador plateau, and Scandinavia, as well as certain\r\nmountain regions. As soon as a snowfield became somewhat extensive, it\r\nwould begin to produce striking climatic alterations in addition to\r\nthose to which it owed its origin.[41] For example, within a snowfield\r\nthe summers remain relatively cold. Hence such a field is likely to be\r\nan area of high pressure at all seasons. The fact that the snowfield is\r\nalways a place of relatively high pressure results in outblowing surface\r\nwinds except when these are temporarily overcome by the passage of\r\nstrong cyclonic storms. The storms, however, tend to be concentrated\r\nnear the margins of the ice throughout the year instead of following\r\ndifferent paths in each of the four seasons. This is partly because\r\ncyclonic lows always avoid places of high pressure and are thus pushed\r\nout of the areas where permanent snow has accumulated. On the other\r\nhand, at times of many sunspots, as Kullmer has shown, the main storm\r\ntrack tends to be drawn poleward, perhaps by electrical conditions.\r\nHence when a snowfield is present in the north, the lows, instead of\r\nmigrating much farther north in summer than in winter, as they now do,\r\nwould merely crowd on to the snowfield a little farther in summer than\r\nin winter. Thus the heavy precipitation which is usual in humid climates\r\nnear the centers of lows would take place near the advancing margin of\r\nthe snowfield and cause the field to expand still farther southward.\r\n\r\nThe tendency toward the accumulation of snow on the margins of the\r\nsnowfields would be intensified not only by the actual storms\r\nthemselves, but by other conditions. For example, the coldness of the\r\nsnow would tend to cause prompt condensation of the moisture brought by\r\nthe winds that blow toward the storm centers from low latitudes. Again,\r\nin spite of the general dryness of the air over a snowfield, the lower\r\nair contains some moisture due to evaporation from the snow by day\r\nduring the clear sunny weather of anti-cyclones or highs. Where this is\r\nsufficient, the cold surface of the snowfields tends to produce a frozen\r\nfog whenever the snowfield is cooled by radiation, as happens at night\r\nand during the passage of highs. Such a frozen fog is an effective\r\nreflector of solar radiation. Moreover, because ice has only half the\r\nspecific heat of water, and is much more transparent to heat, such a\r\n\"radiation fog\" composed of ice crystals is a much less effective\r\nretainer of heat than clouds or fog made of unfrozen water particles.\r\nShallow fogs of this type are described by several polar expeditions.\r\nThey clearly retard the melting of the snow and thus help the icefield\r\nto grow.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, so long as storminess remained great, the\r\nPleistocene snowfields, according to the solar hypothesis, must have\r\ndeepened and expanded. In due time some of the snow was converted into\r\nglacial ice. When that occurred, the growth of the snowfield as well as\r\nof the ice cap must have been accelerated by glacial movement. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, as the ice crowded southward toward the source of\r\nthe moisture by which it grew, the area of high pressure produced by its\r\nlow temperature would expand. This would force the storm track southward\r\nin spite of the contrary tendency due to the sun. When the ice sheet had\r\nbecome very extensive, the track would be crowded relatively near to the\r\nnorthern margin of the trade-wind belt. Indeed, the Pleistocene ice\r\nsheets, at the time of their maximum extension, reached almost as far\r\nsouth as the latitude now marking the northern limit of the trade-wind\r\nbelt in summer. As the storm track with its frequent low pressure and\r\nthe subtropical belt with its high pressure were forced nearer and\r\nnearer together, the barometric gradient between the two presumably\r\nbecame greater, winds became stronger, and the storms more intense.\r\n\r\nThis zonal crowding would be of special importance in summer, at which\r\ntime it would also be most pronounced. In the first place, the storms\r\nwould be crowded far upon the ice cap which would then be protected from\r\nthe sun by a cover of fog and cloud more fully than at any other season.\r\nFurthermore, the close approach of the trade-wind belt to the storm belt\r\nwould result in a great increase in the amount of moisture drawn from\r\nthe belt of evaporation which the trade winds dominate. In the\r\ntrade-wind belt, clear skies and high temperature make evaporation\r\nespecially rapid. Indeed, in spite of the vast deserts it is probable\r\nthat more than three-fourths of the total evaporation now taking place\r\non the earth occurs in the belt of trades, an area which includes about\r\none-half of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nThe agency which could produce this increased drawing northward of\r\nmoisture from the trade-wind belt would be the winds blowing into the\r\nlows. According to the cyclonic hypothesis, many of these lows would be\r\nso strong that they would temporarily break down the subtropical belt of\r\nhigh pressure which now usually prevails between the trades and the zone\r\nof westerly winds. This belt is even now often broken by tropical\r\ncyclones. If the storms of more northerly regions temporarily destroyed\r\nthe subtropical high-pressure belt, even though they still remained on\r\nits northern side, they would divert part of the trade winds. Hence the\r\nair which now is carried obliquely equatorward by those winds would be\r\ncarried spirally northward into the cyclonic lows. Precipitation in the\r\nstorm track on the margin of the relatively cold ice sheet would thus be\r\nmuch increased, for most winds from low latitudes carry abundant\r\nmoisture. Such a diversion of moisture from low latitudes probably\r\nexplains the deficiency of precipitation along the heat equator at times\r\nof solar activity, as shown in Fig. 3. Taken as a whole, the summer\r\nconditions, according to the cyclonic hypothesis, would be such that\r\nincreased evaporation in low latitudes would cooeperate with increased\r\nstorminess, cloudiness, and fog in higher latitudes to preserve and\r\nincrease the accumulation of ice upon the borders of the ice sheet. The\r\ngreater the storminess, the more this would be true and the more the ice\r\nsheet would be able to hold its own against melting in summer. Such a\r\ncombination of precipitation and of protection from the sun is\r\nespecially important if an ice sheet is to grow.\r\n\r\nThe meteorologist needs no geologic evidence that the storm track was\r\nshoved equatorward by the growth of the ice sheet, for he observes a\r\nsimilar shifting whenever a winter's snow cap occupies part of the\r\nnormal storm tract. The geologist, however, may welcome geologic\r\nevidence that such an extreme shift of the storm track actually occurred\r\nduring the Pleistocene. Harmer, in 1901, first pointed out the evidence\r\nwhich was repeated with approval by Wright of the Ireland Geological\r\nSurvey in 1914.[42] According to these authorities, numerous boulders of\r\na distinctive chalk were deposited by Pleistocene icebergs along the\r\ncoast of Ireland. Their distribution shows that at the time of maximum\r\nglaciation the strong winds along the south coast of Ireland were from\r\nthe northeast while today they are from the southwest. Such a reversal\r\ncould apparently be produced only by a southward shift of the center of\r\nthe main storm track from its present position in northern Ireland,\r\nScotland, and Norway to a position across northern France, central\r\nGermany, and middle Russia. This would mean that while now the centers\r\nof the lows commonly move northeastward a short distance north of\r\nsouthern Ireland, they formerly moved eastward a short distance south of\r\nIreland. It will be recalled that in the northern hemisphere the winds\r\nspiral into a low counter-clockwise and that they are strongest near the\r\ncenter. When the centers pass not far north of a given point, the strong\r\nwinds therefore blow from the west or southwest, while when the centers\r\npass just south of that point, the strong winds come from the east or\r\nnortheast.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the consequences of the crowding of the storm track\r\ntoward the trade-wind belt, several other conditions presumably operated\r\nto favor the growth of the ice sheet. For example, the lowering of the\r\nsea level by the removal of water to form the snowfields and glaciers\r\ninterfered with warm currents. It also increased the rate of erosion,\r\nfor it was equivalent to an uplift of all the land. One consequence of\r\nerosion and weathering was presumably a diminution of the carbon dioxide\r\nin the atmosphere, for although the ice covered perhaps a tenth of the\r\nlands and interfered with carbonation to that extent, the removal of\r\nlarge quantities of soil by accelerated erosion on the other nine-tenths\r\nperhaps more than counterbalanced the protective effect of the ice. At\r\nthe same time, the general lowering of the temperature of the ocean as\r\nwell as the lands increased the ocean's capacity for carbon dioxide and\r\nthus facilitated absorption. At a temperature of 50 deg.F. water absorbs 32\r\nper cent more carbon dioxide than at 68 deg.. The high waves produced by the\r\nsevere storms must have had a similar effect on a small scale. Thus the\r\npercentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was presumably\r\ndiminished. Of less significance than these changes in the lands and the\r\nair, but perhaps not negligible, was the increased salinity of the ocean\r\nwhich accompanied the removal of water to form snow, and the increase of\r\nthe dissolved mineral load of the rejuvenated streams. Increased\r\nsalinity slows up the deep-sea circulation, as we shall see in a later\r\nchapter. This increases the contrasts from zone to zone.\r\n\r\nAt times of great solar activity the agencies mentioned above would\r\napparently cooeperate to cause an advance of ice sheets into lower\r\nlatitudes. The degree of solar activity would have much to do with the\r\nfinal extent of the ice sheets. Nevertheless, certain terrestrial\r\nconditions would tend to set limits beyond which the ice would not\r\ngreatly advance unless the storminess were extraordinarily severe. The\r\nmost obvious of these conditions is the location of oceans and of\r\ndeserts or semi-arid regions. The southwestward advance of the European\r\nice sheet and the southeastward advance of the Labradorean sheet in\r\nAmerica were stopped by the Atlantic. The semi-aridity of the Great\r\nPlains, produced by their position in the lee of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nstopped the advance of the Keewatin ice sheet toward the southwest. The\r\nadvance of the European ice sheet southeast seems to have been stopped\r\nfor similar reasons. The cessation of the advance would be brought about\r\nin such an area not alone by the light precipitation and abundant\r\nsunshine, but by the dryness of the air, and also by the power of dust\r\nto absorb the sun's heat. Much dust would presumably be drawn in from\r\nthe dry regions by passing cyclonic storms and would be scattered over\r\nthe ice.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the ice is also slowed up by a rugged topography, as\r\namong the Appalachians in northern Pennsylvania. Such a topography\r\nbesides opposing a physical obstruction to the movement of the ice\r\nprovides bare south-facing slopes which the sun warms effectively. Such\r\nwarm slopes are unfavorable to glacial advance. The rugged topography\r\nwas perhaps quite as effective as the altitude of the Appalachians in\r\ncausing the conspicuous northward dent in the glacial margin in\r\nPennsylvania. Where glaciers lie in mountain valleys the advance beyond\r\na certain point is often interfered with by the deployment of the ice at\r\nthe mouths of gorges. Evaporation and melting are more rapid where a\r\nglacier is broad and thin than where it is narrow and thick, as in a\r\ngorge. Again, where the topography or the location of oceans or dry\r\nareas causes the glacial lobes to be long and narrow, the elongation of\r\nthe lobe is apparently checked in several ways. Toward the end of the\r\nlobe, melting and evaporation increase rapidly because the planetary\r\nwesterly winds are more likely to overcome the glacial winds and sweep\r\nacross a long, narrow lobe than across a broad one. As they cross the\r\nlobe, they accelerate evaporation, and probably lessen cloudiness, with\r\na consequent augmentation of melting. Moreover, although lows rarely\r\ncross a broad ice sheet, they do cross a narrow lobe. For example,\r\nNansen records that strong lows occasionally cross the narrow southern\r\npart of the Greenland ice sheet. The longer the lobe, the more likely it\r\nis that lows will cross it, instead of following its margin. Lows which\r\ncross a lobe do not yield so much snow to the tip as do those which\r\nfollow the margin. Hence elongation is retarded and finally stopped even\r\nwithout a change in the earth's general climate.\r\n\r\nBecause of these various reasons the advances of the ice during the\r\nseveral epochs of a glacial period might be approximately equal, even if\r\nthe durations of the periods of storminess and low temperature were\r\ndifferent. Indeed, they might be sub-equal, even if the periods differed\r\nin intensity as well as length. Differences in the periods would\r\napparently be manifested less in the extent of the ice than in the depth\r\nof glacial erosion and in the thickness of the terminal moraines,\r\noutwash plains, and other glacial or glacio-fluvial formations.\r\n\r\nHaving completed the consideration of the conditions leading to the\r\nadvance of the ice, let us now consider the condition of North America\r\nat the time of maximum glaciation.[43] Over an area of nearly four\r\nmillion square miles, occupying practically all the northern half of the\r\ncontinent and part of the southern half, as appears in Fig. 6, the\r\nsurface was a monotonous and almost level plain of ice covered with\r\nsnow. When viewed from a high altitude, all parts except the margins\r\nmust have presented a uniformly white and sparkling appearance. Along\r\nthe margins, however, except to the north, the whiteness was irregular,\r\nfor the view must have included not only fresh snow, but moving clouds\r\nand dirty snow or ice. Along the borders where melting was in progress\r\nthere was presumably more or less spottedness due to morainal material\r\nor glacial debris brought to the surface by ice shearage and wastage.\r\nAlong the dry southwestern border it is also possible that there were\r\nnumerous dark spots due to dust blown onto the ice by the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 6. Distribution of Pleistocene ice sheets._\r\n(_After Schuchert._)]\r\n\r\nThe great white sheet with its ragged border was roughly circular in\r\nform, with its center in central Canada. Yet there were many departures\r\nfrom a perfectly circular form. Some were due to the oceans, for, except\r\nin northern Alaska, the ice extended into the ocean all the way from New\r\nJersey around by the north to Washington. On the south, topographic\r\nconditions made the margin depart from a simple arc. From New Jersey to\r\nOhio it swung northward. In the Mississippi Valley it reached far south;\r\nindeed most of the broad wedge between the Ohio and the Missouri rivers\r\nwas occupied by ice. From latitude 37 deg. near the junction of the Missouri\r\nand the Mississippi, however, the ice margin extended almost due north\r\nalong the Missouri to central North Dakota. It then stretched westward\r\nto the Rockies. Farther west lowland glaciation was abundant as far\r\nsouth as western Washington. In the Rockies, the Cascades, and the\r\nSierra Nevadas glaciation was common as far south as Colorado and\r\nsouthern California, respectively, and snowfields were doubtless\r\nextensive enough to make these ranges ribbons of white. Between these\r\nlofty ranges lay a great unglaciated region, but even in the Great Basin\r\nitself, in spite of its present aridity, certain ranges carried\r\nglaciers, while great lakes expanded widely.\r\n\r\nIn this vast field of snow the glacial ice slowly crept outward,\r\npossibly at an average speed of half a foot a day, but varying from\r\nalmost nothing in winter at the north, to several feet a day in summer\r\nat the south.[44] The force which caused the movement was the presence\r\nof the ice piled up not far from the margins. Almost certainly, however,\r\nthere was no great dome from the center in Canada outward, as some early\r\nwriters assumed. Such a dome would require that the ice be many\r\nthousands of feet thick near its center. This is impossible because of\r\nthe fact that ice is more voluminous than water (about 9 per cent near\r\nthe freezing point). Hence when subjected to sufficient pressure it\r\nchanges to the liquid form. As friction and internal heat tend to keep\r\nthe bottom of a glacier warm, even in cold regions, the probabilities\r\nare that only under very special conditions was a continental ice sheet\r\nmuch thicker than about 2500 feet. In Antarctica, where the temperature\r\nis much lower than was probably attained in the United States, the ice\r\nsheet is nearly level, several expeditions having traveled hundreds of\r\nmiles with practically no change in altitude. In Shackleton's trip\r\nalmost to the South Pole, he encountered a general rise of 3000 feet in\r\n1200 miles. Mountains, however, projected through the ice even near the\r\npole and the geologists conclude that the ice is not very thick even at\r\nthe world's coldest point, the South Pole.\r\n\r\nAlong the margin of the ice there were two sorts of movement, much more\r\nrapid than the slow creep of the ice. One was produced by the outward\r\ndrift of snow carried by the outblowing dry winds and the other and more\r\nimportant was due to the passage of cyclonic storms. Along the border of\r\nthe ice sheet, except at the north, storm presumably closely followed\r\nstorm. Their movement, we judge, was relatively slow until near the\r\nsouthern end of the Mississippi lobe, but when this point was passed\r\nthey moved much more rapidly, for then they could go toward instead of\r\naway from the far northern path which the sun prescribes when solar\r\nactivity is great. The storms brought much snow to the icefield, perhaps\r\nsometimes in favored places as much as the hundred feet a year which is\r\nrecorded for some winters in the Sierras at present. Even the\r\nunglaciated intermontane Great Basin presumably received considerable\r\nprecipitation, perhaps twice as much as its present scanty supply. The\r\nrainfall was enough to support many lakes, one of which was ten times as\r\nlarge as Great Salt Lake; and grass was doubtless abundant upon many\r\nslopes which are now dry and barren. The relatively heavy precipitation\r\nin the Great Basin was probably due primarily to the increased number of\r\nstorms, but may also have been much influenced by their slow eastward\r\nmovement. The lows presumably moved slowly in that general region not\r\nonly because they were retarded and turned from their normal path by the\r\ncold ice to the east, but because during the summer the area between the\r\nSierra snowfields on the west and the Rocky Mountain and Mississippi\r\nValley snowfields on the east was relatively warm. Hence it was normally\r\na place of low pressure and therefore of inblowing winds. Slow-moving\r\nlows are much more effective than fast-moving ones in drawing moisture\r\nnorthwestward from the Gulf of Mexico, for they give the moisture more\r\ntime to move spirally first northeast, under the influence of the normal\r\nsouthwesterly winds, then northwest and finally southwest as it\r\napproaches the storm center. In the case of the present lows, before\r\nmuch moisture-laden air can describe such a circuit, first eastward and\r\nthen westward, the storm center has nearly always moved eastward across\r\nthe Rockies and even across the Great Plains. A result of this is the\r\nregular decrease in precipitation northward, northwestward, and westward\r\nfrom the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAlong the part of the glacial margins where for more than 3000 miles the\r\nNorth American ice entered the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, myriads\r\nof great blocks broke off and floated away as stately icebergs, to\r\nscatter boulders far over the ocean floor and to melt in warmer climes.\r\nWhere the margin lay upon the lands numerous streams issued from beneath\r\nthe ice, milk-white with rock flour, and built up great outwash plains\r\nand valley trains of gravel and sand. Here and there, just beyond the\r\nice, marginal lakes of strange shapes occupied valleys which had been\r\ndammed by the advancing ice. In many of them the water level rose until\r\nit reached some low point in the divide and then overflowed, forming\r\nrapids and waterfalls. Indeed, many of the waterfalls of the eastern\r\nUnited States and Canada were formed in just this way and not a few\r\nstreams now occupy courses through ridges instead of parallel to them,\r\nas in pre-glacial times.\r\n\r\nIn the zone to the south of the continental ice sheet, the plant and\r\nanimal life of boreal, cool temperate, and warm temperate regions\r\ncommingled curiously. Heather and Arctic willow crowded out elm and oak;\r\nmusk ox, hairy mammoth, and marmot contested with deer, chipmunk, and\r\nskunk for a chance to live. Near the ice on slopes exposed to the cold\r\nglacial gales, the immigrant boreal species were dominant, but not far\r\naway in more protected areas the species that had formerly lived there\r\nheld their own. In Europe during the last two advances of the great ice\r\nsheet the caveman also struggled with fierce animals and a fiercer\r\nclimate to maintain life in an area whose habitability had long been\r\ndecreasing.\r\n\r\nThe next step in our history of glaciation is to outline the\r\ndisappearance of the ice sheets. When a decrease in solar activity\r\nproduced a corresponding decrease in storminess, several influences\r\npresumably combined to cause the disappearance of the ice. Most of their\r\nresults are the reverse of those which brought on glaciation. A few\r\nspecial aspects, however, some of which have been discussed in _Earth\r\nand Sun_, ought to be brought to mind. A diminution in storminess\r\nlessens upward convection, wind velocity, and evaporation, and these\r\nchanges, if they occurred, must have united to raise the temperature of\r\nthe lower air by reducing the escape of heat. Again a decrease in the\r\nnumber and intensity of tropical cyclones presumably lessened the amount\r\nof moisture carried into mid-latitudes, and thus diminished the\r\nprecipitation. The diminution of snowfall on the ice sheets when\r\nstorminess diminished was probably highly important. The amount of\r\nprecipitation on the sheets was presumably lessened still further by\r\nchanges in the storminess of middle latitudes. When storminess\r\ndiminishes, the lows follow a less definite path, as Kullmer's maps\r\nshow, and on the average a more southerly path. Thus, instead of all the\r\nlows contributing snow to the ice sheet, a large fraction of the\r\nrelatively few remaining lows would bring rain to areas south of the ice\r\nsheet. As storminess decreased, the trades and westerlies probably\r\nbecame steadier, and thus carried to high latitudes more warm water than\r\nwhen often interrupted by storms. Steadier southwesterly winds must have\r\nproduced a greater movement of atmospheric as well as oceanic heat to\r\nhigh latitudes. The warming due to these two causes was probably the\r\nchief reason for the disappearance of the European ice sheet and of\r\nthose on the Pacific coast of North America. The two greater American\r\nice sheets, however, and the glaciers elsewhere in the lee of high\r\nmountain ranges, probably disappeared chiefly because of lessened\r\nprecipitation. If there were no cyclonic storms to draw moisture\r\nnorthward from the Gulf of Mexico, most of North America east of the\r\nRocky Mountain barrier would be arid. Therefore a diminution of\r\nstorminess would be particularly effective in causing the disappearance\r\nof ice sheets in these regions.\r\n\r\nThat evaporation was an especially important factor in causing the ice\r\nfrom the Keewatin center to disappear, is suggested by the relatively\r\nsmall amount of water-sorted material in its drift. In South Dakota, for\r\nexample, less than 10 per cent of the drift is stratified.[45] On the\r\nother hand, Salisbury estimates that perhaps a third of the Labradorean\r\ndrift in eastern Wisconsin is crudely stratified, about half of that in\r\nNew Jersey, and more than half of the drift in western Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun's activity began to diminish, all these conditions, as well\r\nas several others, would cooeperate to cause the ice sheets to disappear.\r\nStep by step with their disappearance, the amelioration of the climate\r\nwould progress so long as the period of solar inactivity continued and\r\nstorms were rare. If the inactivity continued long enough, it would\r\nresult in a fairly mild climate in high latitudes, though so long as the\r\ncontinents were emergent this mildness would not be of the extreme type.\r\nThe inauguration of another cycle of increased disturbance of the sun,\r\nwith a marked increase in storminess, would inaugurate another glacial\r\nepoch. Thus a succession of glacial and inter-glacial epochs might\r\ncontinue so long as the sun was repeatedly disturbed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: This chapter is an amplification and revision of the\r\nsketch of the glacial period contained in The Solar Hypothesis of\r\nClimatic Changes; Bull.

The discussion will be grouped under five\r\nheads: (I) the localization of glaciation; (II) the sudden coming of\r\nglaciation; (III) peculiar variations in the height of the snow line and\r\nof glaciation; (IV) lakes and other evidences of humidity in unglaciated\r\nregions during the glacial epochs; (V) glaciation at sea level and in\r\nlow latitudes in the Permian and Proterozoic eras. The discussion of\r\nperhaps the most difficult of all climatic problems of glaciation, that\r\nof the succession of cold glacial and mild inter-glacial epochs, has\r\nbeen postponed to the next to the final chapter of this book. It cannot\r\nbe properly considered until we take up the history of solar\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nI. The first problem, the localization of the ice sheets, arises from\r\nthe fact that in both the Pleistocene and the Permian periods glaciation\r\nwas remarkably limited. In neither period were all parts of high\r\nlatitudes glaciated; yet in both cases glaciation occurred in large\r\nregions in lower latitudes. Many explanations of this localization have\r\nbeen offered, but most are entirely inadequate. Even hypotheses with\r\nsomething of proven worth, such as those of variations in volcanic dust\r\nand in atmospheric carbon dioxide, fail to account for localization. The\r\ncyclonic form of the solar hypothesis, however, seems to afford a\r\nsatisfactory explanation.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the ice in the last glacial period is well known,\r\nand is shown in Fig. 6. Four-fifths of the ice-covered area, which was\r\neight million square miles, more or less, was near the borders of the\r\nNorth Atlantic in eastern North America and northwestern Europe. The ice\r\nspread out from two great centers in North America, the Labradorean east\r\nof Hudson Bay, and the Keewatin west of the bay. There were also many\r\nglaciers in the western mountains, especially in Canada, while\r\nsubordinate centers occurred in Newfoundland, the Adirondacks, and the\r\nWhite Mountains. The main ice sheet at its maximum extension reached as\r\nfar south as latitude 39 deg. in Kansas and Kentucky, and 37 deg. in Illinois.\r\nHuge boulders were transferred more than one thousand miles from their\r\nsource in Canada. The northward extension was somewhat less. Indeed, the\r\nnorthern margin of the continent was apparently relatively little\r\nglaciated and much of Alaska unglaciated. Why should northern Kentucky\r\nbe glaciated when northern Alaska was not?\r\n\r\nIn Europe the chief center from which the continental glacier moved was\r\nthe Scandinavian highlands. It pushed across the depression now occupied\r\nby the Baltic to southern Russia and across the North Sea depression to\r\nEngland and Belgium. The Alps formed a center of considerable\r\nimportance, and there were minor centers in Scotland, Ireland, the\r\nPyrenees, Apennines, Caucasus, and Urals. In Asia numerous ranges also\r\ncontained large glaciers, but practically all the glaciation was of the\r\nalpine type and very little of the vast northern lowland was covered\r\nwith ice.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere glaciation at low latitudes was less striking\r\nthan in the northern hemisphere. Most of the increase in the areas of\r\nice was confined to mountains which today receive heavy precipitation\r\nand still contain small glaciers. Indeed, except for relatively slight\r\nglaciation in the Australian Alps and in Tasmania, most of the\r\nPleistocene glaciation in the southern hemisphere was merely an\r\nextension of existing glaciers, such as those of south Chile, New\r\nZealand, and the Andes. Nevertheless, fairly extensive glaciation\r\nexisted much nearer the equator than is now the case.\r\n\r\nIn considering the localization of Pleistocene glaciation, three main\r\nfactors must be taken into account, namely, temperature, topography, and\r\nprecipitation. The absence of glaciation in large parts of the Arctic\r\nregions of North America and of Asia makes it certain that low\r\ntemperature was not the controlling factor. Aside from Antarctica, the\r\ncoldest place in the world is northeastern Siberia. There for seven\r\nmonths the average temperature is below 0 deg.C., while the mean for the\r\nwhole year is below -10 deg.C. If the temperature during a glacial period\r\naveraged 6 deg.C. lower than now, as is commonly supposed, this part of\r\nSiberia would have had a temperature below freezing for at least nine\r\nmonths out of the twelve even if there were no snowfield to keep the\r\nsummers cold. Yet even under such conditions no glaciation occurred,\r\nalthough in other places, such as parts of Canada and northwestern\r\nEurope, intense glaciation occurred where the mean temperature is much\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the lands apparently had much more influence upon the\r\nlocalization of glaciation than did temperature. Its effect, however,\r\nwas always to cause glaciation exactly where it would be expected and\r\nnot in unexpected places as actually occurred. For example, in North\r\nAmerica the western side of the Canadian Rockies suffered intense\r\nglaciation, for there precipitation was heavy because the westerly winds\r\nfrom the Pacific are forced to give up their moisture as they rise. In\r\nthe same way the western side of the Sierra Nevadas was much more\r\nheavily glaciated than the eastern side. In similar fashion the windward\r\nslopes of the Alps, the Caucasus, the Himalayas, and many other mountain\r\nranges suffered extensive glaciation. Low temperature does not seem to\r\nhave been the cause of this glaciation, for in that case it is hard to\r\nsee why both sides of the various ranges did not show an equal\r\npercentage of increase in the size of their icefields.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said as to temperature and topography, it is evident\r\nthat variations in precipitation have had much more to do with\r\nglaciation than have variations in temperature. In the Arctic lowlands\r\nand on the leeward side of mountains, the slight development of\r\nglaciation appears to have been due to scarcity of precipitation. On the\r\nwindward side of mountains, on the other hand, a notable increase in\r\nprecipitation seems to have led to abundant glaciation. Such an increase\r\nin precipitation must be dependent on increased evaporation and this\r\ncould arise either from relatively high temperature or strong winds.\r\nSince the temperature in the glacial period was lower than now, we seem\r\nforced to attribute the increased precipitation to a strengthening of\r\nthe winds. If the westerly winds from the Pacific should increase in\r\nstrength and waft more moisture to the western side of the Canadian\r\nRockies, or if similar winds increased the snowfall on the upper slopes\r\nof the Alps or the Tian-Shan Mountains, the glaciers would extend lower\r\nthan now without any change in temperature.\r\n\r\nAlthough the incompetence of low temperature to cause glaciation, and\r\nthe relative unimportance of the mountains in northeastern Canada and\r\nnorthwestern Europe throw most glacial hypotheses out of court, they are\r\nin harmony with the cyclonic hypothesis. The answer of that hypothesis\r\nto the problem of the localization of ice sheets seems to be found in\r\ncertain maps of storminess and rainfall in relation to solar activity.\r\nIn Fig. 2 a marked belt of increased storminess at times of many\r\nsunspots is seen in southern Canada. A comparison of this with a series\r\nof maps given in _Earth and Sun_ shows that the stormy belt tends to\r\nmigrate northward in harmony with an increase in the activity of the\r\nsun's atmosphere. If the sun were sufficiently active the belt of\r\nmaximum storminess would apparently pass through the Keewatin and\r\nLabradorean centers of glaciation instead of well to the south of them,\r\nas at present. It would presumably cross another center in Greenland,\r\nand then would traverse the fourth of the great centers of Pleistocene\r\nglaciation in Scandinavia. It would not succeed in traversing northern\r\nAsia, however, any more than it does now, because of the great\r\nhigh-pressure area which develops there in winter. When the ice sheets\r\nexpanded from the main centers of glaciation, the belt of storms would\r\nbe pushed southward and outward. Thus it might give rise to minor\r\ncenters of glaciers such as the Patrician between Hudson Bay and Lake\r\nSuperior, or the centers in Ireland, Cornwall, Wales, and the northern\r\nUral Mountains. As the main ice sheets advanced, however, the minor\r\ncenters would be overridden and the entire mass of ice would be merged\r\ninto one vast expanse in the Atlantic portion of each of the two\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be well to consider briefly the most recent\r\nhypothesis as to the growth and hence the localization of glaciation. In\r\n1911 and more fully in 1915, Hobbs,[46] advanced the anti-cyclonic\r\nhypothesis of the origin of ice sheets. This hypothesis has the great\r\nmerit of focusing attention upon the fact that ice sheets are pronounced\r\nanti-cyclonic regions of high pressure. This is proved by the strong\r\noutblowing winds which prevail along their margins. Such winds must, of\r\ncourse, be balanced by inward-moving winds at high levels. Abundant\r\nobservations prove that such is the case. For example, balloons sent up\r\nby Barkow near the margin of the Antarctic ice sheet reveal the\r\noccurrence of inblowing winds, although they rarely occur below a height\r\nof 9000 meters. The abundant data gathered by Guervain on the coast of\r\nGreenland indicate that outblowing winds prevail up to a height of about\r\n4000 meters. At that height inblowing winds commence and increase in\r\nfrequency until at an altitude of over 5000 meters they become more\r\ncommon than outblowing winds. It should be noted, however, that in both\r\nAntarctica and Greenland, although the winds at an elevation of less\r\nthan a thousand meters generally blow outward, there are frequent and\r\ndecided departures from this rule, so that \"variable winds\" are quite\r\ncommonly mentioned in the reports of expeditions and balloon soundings.\r\n\r\nThe undoubted anti-cyclonic conditions which Hobbs thus calls to the\r\nattention of scientists seem to him to necessitate a peculiar mechanism\r\nin order to produce the snow which feeds the glaciers. He assumes that\r\nthe winds which blow toward the centers of the ice sheets at high levels\r\ncarry the necessary moisture by which the glaciers grow. When the air\r\ndescends in the centers of the highs, it is supposed to be chilled on\r\nreaching the surface of the ice, and hence to give up its moisture in\r\nthe form of minute crystals. This conclusion is doubtful for several\r\nreasons. In the first place, Hobbs does not seem to appreciate the\r\nimportance of the variable winds which he quotes Arctic and Antarctic\r\nexplorers as describing quite frequently on the edges of the ice sheets.\r\nThey are one of many signs that cyclonic storms are fairly frequent on\r\nthe borders of the ice though not in its interior. Thus there is a\r\ndistinct and sufficient form of precipitation actually at work near the\r\nmargin of the ice, or exactly where the thickness of the ice sheet would\r\nlead us to expect.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration which throws grave doubt on the anti-cyclonic\r\nhypothesis of ice sheets is the small amount of moisture possible in the\r\nhighs because of their low temperature. Suppose, for the sake of\r\nargument, that the temperature in the middle of an ice sheet averages\r\n20 deg.F. This is probably much higher than the actual fact and therefore\r\nunduly favorable to the anti-cyclonic hypothesis. Suppose also that the\r\ndecrease in temperature from the earth's surface upward proceeds at the\r\nrate of 1 deg.F. for each 300 feet, which is 50 per cent less than the\r\nactual rate for air with only a slight amount of moisture, such as is\r\nfound in cold regions. Then at a height of 10,000 feet, where the\r\ninblowing winds begin to be felt, the temperature would be -20 deg.F. At\r\nthat temperature the air is able to hold approximately 0.166 grain of\r\nmoisture per cubic foot when fully saturated. This is an exceedingly\r\nsmall amount of moisture and even if it were all precipitated could\r\nscarcely build a glacier. However, it apparently would not be\r\nprecipitated because when such air descends in the center of the\r\nanti-cyclone it is warmed adiabatically, that is, by compression. On\r\nreaching the surface it would have a temperature of 20 deg. and would be\r\nable to hold 0.898 grain of water vapor per cubic foot; in other words,\r\nit would have a relative humidity of about 18 per cent. Under no\r\nreasonable assumption does the upper air at the center of an ice sheet\r\nappear to reach the surface with a relative humidity of more than 20 or\r\n25 per cent. Such air cannot give up moisture. On the contrary, it\r\nabsorbs it and tends to diminish rather than increase the thickness of\r\nthe sheet of ice and snow. But after the surplus heat gained by descent\r\nhas been lost by radiation, conduction, and evaporation, the air may\r\nbecome super-saturated with the moisture picked up while warm. Hobbs\r\nreports that explorers in Antarctica and Greenland have frequently\r\nobserved condensation on their clothing. If such moisture is not derived\r\ndirectly from the men's own bodies, it is apparently picked up from the\r\nice sheet by the descending air, and not added to the ice sheet by air\r\nfrom aloft.\r\n\r\nThe relation of all this to the localization of ice sheets is this. If\r\nHobbs' anti-cyclonic hypothesis of glacial growth is correct, it would\r\nappear that ice sheets should grow up where the temperature is lowest\r\nand the high-pressure areas most persistent; for instance, in northern\r\nSiberia. It would also appear that so far as the topography permitted,\r\nthe ice sheets ought to move out uniformly in all directions; hence the\r\nice sheet ought to be as prominent to the north of the Keewatin and\r\nLabradorean centers as to the south, which is by no means the case.\r\nAgain, in mountainous regions, such as the glacial areas of Alaska and\r\nChile, the glaciation ought not to be confined to the windward slope of\r\nthe mountains so closely as is actually the fact. In each of these cases\r\nthe glaciated region was large enough so that there was probably a true\r\nanti-cyclonic area comparable with that now prevailing over southern\r\nGreenland. In both places the correlation between glaciation and\r\nmountain ranges seems much too close to support the anti-cyclonic\r\nhypothesis, for the inblowing winds which on that hypothesis bring the\r\nmoisture are shown by observation to occur at heights far greater than\r\nthat of all but the loftiest ranges.\r\n\r\nII. The sudden coming of glaciation is another problem which has been a\r\nstumbling-block in the way of every glacial hypothesis. In his _Climates\r\nof Geologic Times_, Schuchert states that the fossils give almost no\r\nwarning of an approaching catastrophe. If glaciation were solely due to\r\nuplift, or other terrestrial changes aside from vulcanism, Schuchert\r\nholds that it would have come slowly and the stages preceding glaciation\r\nwould have affected life sufficiently to be recorded in the rocks. He\r\nconsiders that the suddenness of the coming of glaciation is one of the\r\nstrongest arguments against the carbon dioxide hypothesis of glaciation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the cyclonic hypothesis, however, the suddenness of the\r\noncoming of glaciation is merely what would be expected on the basis of\r\nwhat happens today. Changes in the sun occur suddenly. The sunspot cycle\r\nis only eleven or twelve years long, and even this short period of\r\nactivity is inaugurated more suddenly than it declines. Again the\r\nclimatic record derived from the growth of trees, as given in Figs. 4\r\nand 5, also shows that marked changes in climate are initiated more\r\nrapidly than they disappear. In this connection, however, it must be\r\nremembered that solar activity may arise in various ways, as will appear\r\nmore fully later. Under certain conditions storminess may increase and\r\ndecrease slowly.\r\n\r\nIII. The height of the snow line and of glaciation furnishes another\r\nmeans of testing glacial hypotheses. It is well established that in\r\ntimes of glaciation the snow line was depressed everywhere, but least\r\nnear the equator. For example, according to Penck, permanent snow\r\nextended 4000 feet lower than now in the Alps, whereas it stood only\r\n1500 feet below the present level near the equator in Venezuela. This\r\nunequal depression is not readily accounted for by any hypothesis\r\ndepending solely upon the lowering of temperature. By the carbon dioxide\r\nand the volcanic dust hypotheses, the temperature presumably was lowered\r\nalmost equally in all latitudes, but a little more at the equator than\r\nelsewhere. If glaciation were due to a temporary lessening of the\r\nradiation received from the sun, such as is demanded by the thermal\r\nsolar hypothesis, and by the longer periods of Croll's hypothesis, the\r\nlowering would be distinctly greatest at the equator. Thus, according to\r\nall these hypotheses, the snow line should have been depressed most at\r\nthe equator, instead of least.\r\n\r\nThe cyclonic hypothesis explains the lesser depression of the snow line\r\nat the equator as due to a diminution of precipitation. The\r\neffectiveness of precipitation in this respect is illustrated by the\r\npresent great difference in the height of the snow line on the humid and\r\ndry sides of mountains. On the wet eastern side of the Andes near the\r\nequator, the snow line lies at 16,000 feet; on the dry western side, at\r\n18,500 feet. Again, although the humid side of the Himalayas lies toward\r\nthe south, the snow line has a level of 15,000 feet, while farther\r\nnorth, on the dry side, it is 16,700 feet.[47] The fact that the snow\r\nline is lower near the margin of the Alps than toward the center points\r\nin the same direction. The bearing of all this on the glacial period may\r\nbe judged by looking again at Fig. 3 in Chapter V. This shows that at\r\ntimes of sunspot activity and hence of augmented storminess, the\r\nprecipitation diminishes near the heat equator, that is, where the\r\naverage temperature for the whole year is highest. At present the great\r\nsize of the northern continents and their consequent high temperature in\r\nsummer, cause the heat equator to lie north of the \"real\" equator,\r\nexcept where Australia draws it to the southward.[48] When large parts\r\nof the northern continents were covered with ice, however, the heat\r\nequator and the true equator were probably much closer than now, for the\r\ncontinents could not become so hot. If so, the diminution in equatorial\r\nprecipitation, which accompanies increased storminess throughout the\r\nworld as a whole, would take place more nearly along the true equator\r\nthan appears in Fig. 3. Hence so far as precipitation alone is\r\nconcerned, we should actually expect that the snow line near the equator\r\nwould rise a little during glacial periods. Another factor, however,\r\nmust be considered. Koeppen's data, it will be remembered, show that at\r\ntimes of solar activity the earth's temperature falls more at the\r\nequator than in higher latitudes. If this effect were magnified it would\r\nlower the snow line. The actual position of the snow line at the equator\r\nduring glacial periods thus appears to be the combined effect of\r\ndiminished precipitation, which would raise the line, and of lower\r\ntemperature, which would bring it down.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject it may be well to recall that the relative\r\nlessening of precipitation in equatorial latitudes during the glacial\r\nepochs was probably caused by the diversion of moisture from the\r\ntrade-wind belt. This diversion was presumably due to the great number\r\nof tropical cyclones and to the fact that the cyclonic storms of middle\r\nlatitudes also drew much moisture from the trade-wind belt in summer\r\nwhen the northern position of the sun drew that belt near the storm\r\ntrack which was forced to remain south of the ice sheet. Such diversion\r\nof moisture out of the trade-wind belt must diminish the amount of water\r\nvapor that is carried by the trades to equatorial regions; hence it\r\nwould lessen precipitation in the belt of so-called equatorial calms,\r\nwhich lies along the heat equator rather than along the geographical\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of the vertical distribution of glaciation has been the\r\nsubject of considerable discussion. In the Alps and in many other\r\nmountains the glaciation of the Pleistocene period appears to have had\r\nits upper limit no higher than today. This has been variously\r\ninterpreted. It seems, however, to be adequately explained as due to\r\ndecreased precipitation at high altitudes during the cold periods. This\r\nis in spite of the fact that precipitation in general increased with\r\nincreased storminess. The low temperature of glacial times presumably\r\ninduced condensation at lower altitudes than now, and most of the\r\nprecipitation occurred upon the lower slopes of the mountains,\r\ncontributing to the lower glaciers, while little of it fell upon the\r\nhighest glaciers. Above a moderate altitude in all lofty mountains the\r\ndecrease in the amount of precipitation is rapid. In most cases the\r\ndecrease begins at a height of less than 3000 feet above the base of the\r\nmain slope, provided the slope is steep. The colder the air, the lower\r\nthe altitude at which this occurs. For example, it is much lower in\r\nwinter than in summer. Indeed, the higher altitudes in the Alps are\r\nsunny in winter even where there are abundant clouds lower down.\r\n\r\nIV. The presence of extensive lakes and other evidences of a pluvial\r\nclimate during glacial periods in non-glaciated regions which are\r\nnormally dry is another of the facts which most glacial hypotheses fail\r\nto explain satisfactorily. Beyond the ice sheets many regions appear to\r\nhave enjoyed an unusually heavy precipitation during the glacial epochs.\r\nThe evidence of this is abundant, including numerous abandoned strand\r\nlines of salt lakes and an abundance of coarse material in deltas and\r\nflood plains. J. D. Whitney,[49] in an interesting but neglected volume,\r\nwas one of the first to marshal the evidence of this sort. More recently\r\nFree[50] has amplified this. According to him in the Great Basin region\r\nof the United States sixty-two basins either contain unmistakable\r\nevidence of lakes, or belong to one of the three great lake groups named\r\nbelow. Two of these, the Lake Lahontan and the Lake Bonneville groups,\r\ncomprise twenty-nine present basins, while the third, the Owens-Searles\r\nchain, contained at least five large lakes, the lowest being in Death\r\nValley. In western and central Asia a far greater series of salt lakes\r\nis found and most of these are surrounded by strands at high levels.\r\nMany of these are described in _Explorations in Turkestan_, _The Pulse\r\nof Asia_, and _Palestine and Its Transformation_. There has been a good\r\ndeal of debate as to whether these lakes actually date from the glacial\r\nperiod, as is claimed by C. E. P. Brooks, for example, or from some\r\nother period. The evidence, however, seems to be convincing that the\r\nlakes expanded when the ice also expanded.\r\n\r\nAccording to the older glacial hypotheses the lower temperature which is\r\npostulated as the cause of glaciation would almost certainly mean less\r\nevaporation over the oceans and hence less precipitation during glacial\r\nperiods. To counteract this the only way in which the level of the lakes\r\ncould be raised would be because the lower temperature would cause less\r\nevaporation from their surfaces. It seems quite impossible, however,\r\nthat the lowering of temperature, which is commonly taken to have been\r\nnot more than 10 deg.C., could counteract the lessened precipitation and\r\nalso cause an enormous expansion of most of the lakes. For example,\r\nancient Lake Bonneville was more than ten times as large as its modern\r\nremnant, Great Salt Lake, and its average depth more than forty times as\r\ngreat.[51] Many small lakes in the Old World expanded still more.[52]\r\nFor example, in eastern Persia many basins which now contain no lake\r\nwhatever are floored with vast deposits of lacustrine salt and are\r\nsurrounded by old lake bluffs and beaches. In northern Africa similar\r\nconditions prevail.[53] Other, but less obvious, evidence of more\r\nabundant rainfall in regions that are now dry is found in thick strata\r\nof gravel, sand, and fine silt in the alluvial deposits of flood plains\r\nand deltas.[54]\r\n\r\nThe cyclonic hypothesis supposes that increased storminess accounts for\r\npluvial climates in regions that are now dry just as it accounts for\r\nglaciation in the regions of the ice sheets. Figs. 2 and 3, it will be\r\nremembered, illustrate what happens when the sun is active. Solar\r\nactivity is accompanied by an increase in storminess in the southwestern\r\nUnited States in exactly the region where elevated strands of diminished\r\nsalt lakes are most numerous. In Fig. 3, the same condition is seen in\r\nthe region of salt lakes in the Old World. Judging by these maps, which\r\nillustrate what has happened since careful meteorological records were\r\nkept, an increase in solar activity is accompanied by increased rainfall\r\nin large parts of what are now semi-arid and desert regions. Such\r\nprecipitation would at once cause the level of the lakes to rise. Later,\r\nwhen ice sheets had developed in Europe and America, the high-pressure\r\nareas thus caused might force the main storm belt so far south that it\r\nwould lie over these same arid regions. The increase in tropical\r\nhurricanes at times of abundant sunspots may also have a bearing on the\r\nclimate of regions that are now arid. During the glacial period some of\r\nthe hurricanes probably swept far over the lands. The numerous tropical\r\ncyclones of Australia, for example, are the chief source of\r\nprecipitation for that continent.[55] Some of the stronger cyclones\r\nlocally yield more rain in a day or two than other sources yield in a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nV. The occurrence of widespread glaciation near the tropics during the\r\nPermian, as shown in Fig. 7, has given rise to much discussion. The\r\nrecent discovery of glaciation in latitudes as low as 30 deg. in the\r\nProterozoic is correspondingly significant. In all cases the occurrence\r\nof glaciation in low and middle latitudes is probably due to the same\r\ngeneral causes. Doubtless the position and altitude of the mountains had\r\nsomething to do with the matter. Yet taken by itself this seems\r\ninsufficient. Today the loftiest range in the world, the Himalayas, is\r\nalmost unglaciated, although its southern slope may seem at first\r\nthought to be almost ideally located in this respect. Some parts rise\r\nover 20,000 feet and certain lower slopes receive 400 inches of rain per\r\nyear. The small size of the Himalayan glaciers in spite of these\r\nfavorable conditions is apparently due largely to the seasonal character\r\nof the monsoon winds. The strong outblowing monsoons of winter cause\r\nabout half the year to be very dry with clear skies and dry winds from\r\nthe interior of Asia. In all low latitudes the sun rides high in the\r\nheavens at midday, even in winter, and thus melts snow fairly\r\neffectively in clear weather. This is highly unfavorable to glaciation.\r\nThe inblowing southern monsoons bring all their moisture in midsummer at\r\njust the time when it is least effective in producing snow. Conditions\r\nsimilar to those now prevailing in the Himalayas must accompany any\r\ngreat uplift of the lands which produces high mountains and large\r\ncontinents in subtropical and middle latitudes. Hence, uplift alone\r\ncannot account for extensive glaciation in subtropical latitudes during\r\nthe Permian and Proterozoic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 7. Permian geography and glaciation._\r\n(_After Schuchert._)]\r\n\r\nThe assumption of a great general lowering of temperature is also not\r\nadequate to explain glaciation in subtropical latitudes. In the first\r\nplace this would require a lowering of many degrees,--far more than in\r\nthe Pleistocene glacial period. The marine fossils of the Permian,\r\nhowever, do not indicate any such condition. In the second place, if the\r\nlands were widespread as they appear to have been in the Permian, a\r\ngeneral lowering of temperature would diminish rather than increase the\r\npresent slight efficiency of the monsoons in producing glaciation.\r\nMonsoons depend upon the difference between the temperatures of land and\r\nwater. If the general temperature were lowered, the reduction would be\r\nmuch less pronounced on the oceans than on the lands, for water tends to\r\npreserve a uniform temperature, not only because of its mobility, but\r\nbecause of the large amount of heat given out when freezing takes place,\r\nor consumed in evaporation. Hence the general lowering of temperature\r\nwould make the contrast between continents and oceans less than at\r\npresent in summer, for the land temperature would be brought toward that\r\nof the ocean. This would diminish the strength of the inblowing summer\r\nmonsoons and thus cut off part of the supply of moisture. Evidence that\r\nthis actually happened in the cold fourteenth century has already been\r\ngiven in Chapter VI. On the other hand, in winter the lands would be\r\nmuch colder than now and the oceans only a little colder, so that the\r\ndry outblowing monsoons of the cold season would increase in strength\r\nand would also last longer than at present. In addition to all this, the\r\nmere fact of low temperature would mean a general reduction in the\r\namount of water vapor in the air. Thus, from almost every point of view\r\na mere lowering of temperature seems to be ruled out as a cause of\r\nPermian glaciation. Moreover, if the Permian or Proterozoic glacial\r\nperiods were so cold that the lands above latitude 30 deg. were snow-covered\r\nmost of the time, the normal surface winds in subtropical latitudes\r\nwould be largely equatorward, just as the winter monsoons now are. Hence\r\nlittle or no moisture would be available to feed the snowfields which\r\ngive rise to the glaciers.\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed by Marsden Manson and others that increased general\r\ncloudiness would account for the subtropical glaciation of the Permian\r\nand Proterozoic. Granting for the moment that there could be universal\r\npersistent cloudiness, this would not prevent or counteract the\r\noutblowing anti-cyclonic winds so characteristic of great snowfields.\r\nTherefore, under the hypothesis of general cloudiness there would be no\r\nsupply of moisture to cause glaciation in low latitudes. Indeed,\r\npersistent cloudiness in all higher latitudes would apparently deprive\r\nthe Himalayas of most of their present moisture, for the interior of\r\nAsia would not become hot in summer and no inblowing monsoons would\r\ndevelop. In fact, winds of all kinds would seemingly be scarce, for they\r\narise almost wholly from contrasts of temperature and hence of\r\natmospheric pressure. The only way to get winds and hence precipitation\r\nwould be to invoke some other agency, such as cyclonic storms, but that\r\nwould be a departure from the supposition that glaciation arose from\r\ncloudiness.\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire how the cyclonic hypothesis accounts for glaciation\r\nin low latitudes. We will first consider the terrestrial conditions in\r\nthe early Permian, the last period of glaciation in such latitudes.\r\nGeologists are almost universally agreed that the lands were\r\nexceptionally extensive and also high, especially in low latitudes. One\r\nevidence of this is the presence of abundant conglomerates composed of\r\ngreat boulders. It is also probable that the carbon dioxide in the air\r\nduring the early Permian had been reduced to a minimum by the\r\nextraordinary amount of coal formed during the preceding period. This\r\nwould tend to produce low temperature and thus make the conditions\r\nfavorable for glaciation as soon as an accentuation of solar activity\r\ncaused unusual storminess. If the storminess became extreme when\r\nterrestrial conditions were thus universally favorable to glaciation, it\r\nwould presumably produce glaciation in low latitudes. Numerous and\r\nintense tropical cyclones would carry a vast amount of moisture out of\r\nthe tropics, just as now happens when the sun is active, but on a far\r\nlarger scale. The moisture would be precipitated on the equatorward\r\nslopes of the subtropical mountain ranges. At high elevations this\r\nprecipitation would be in the form of snow even in summer. Tropical\r\ncyclones, however, as is shown in _Earth and Sun_, occur in the autumn\r\nand winter as well as in summer. For example, in the Bay of Bengal the\r\nnumber recorded in October is fifty, the largest for any month; while in\r\nNovember it is thirty-four, and December fourteen as compared with an\r\naverage of forty-two for the months of July to September. From January\r\nto March, when sunspot numbers averaged more than forty, the number of\r\ntropical hurricanes was 143 per cent greater than when the sunspot\r\nnumbers averaged below forty. During the months from April to June,\r\nwhich also would be times of considerable snowy precipitation, tropical\r\nhurricanes averaged 58 per cent more numerous with sunspot numbers above\r\nforty than with numbers below forty, while from July to September the\r\ndifference amounted to 23 per cent. Even at this season some snow falls\r\non the higher slopes, while the increased cloudiness due to numerous\r\nstorms also tends to preserve the snow. Thus a great increase in the\r\nfrequency of sunspots is accompanied by increased intensity of tropical\r\nhurricanes, especially in the cooler autumn and spring months, and\r\nresults not only in a greater accumulation of snow but in a decrease in\r\nthe melting of the snow because of more abundant clouds. At such times\r\nas the Permian, the general low temperature due to rapid convection and\r\nto the scarcity of carbon dioxide presumably joined with the extension\r\nof the lands in producing great high-pressure areas over the lands in\r\nmiddle latitudes during the winters, and thus caused the more northern,\r\nor mid-latitude type of cyclonic storms to be shifted to the equatorward\r\nside of the continents at that season. This would cause an increase of\r\nprecipitation in winter as well as during the months when tropical\r\nhurricanes abound. Many other circumstances would cooeperate to produce a\r\nsimilar result. For example, the general low temperature would cause the\r\nsea to be covered with ice in lower latitudes than now, and would help\r\nto create high-pressure areas in middle latitudes, thus driving the\r\nstorms far south. If the sea water were fresher than now, as it probably\r\nwas to a notable extent in the Proterozoic and perhaps to some slight\r\nextent in the Permian, the higher freezing point would also further the\r\nextension of the ice and help to keep the storms away from high\r\nlatitudes. If to this there is added a distribution of land and sea such\r\nthat the volume of the warm ocean currents flowing from low to high\r\nlatitudes was diminished, as appears to have been the case, there seems\r\nto be no difficulty in explaining the subtropical location of the main\r\nglaciation in both the Permian and the Proterozoic. An increase of\r\nstorminess seems to be the key to the whole situation.\r\n\r\nOne other possibility may be mentioned, although little stress should be\r\nlaid on it. In _Earth and Sun_ it has been shown that the main storm\r\ntrack in both the northern and southern hemispheres is not concentric\r\nwith the geographical poles. Both tracks are roughly concentric with the\r\ncorresponding magnetic poles, a fact which may be important in\r\nconnection with the hypothesis of an electrical effect of the sun upon\r\nterrestrial storminess. The magnetic poles are known to wander\r\nconsiderably. Such wandering gives rise to variations in the direction\r\nof the magnetic needle from year to year. In 1815 the compass in England\r\npointed 24-1/2 deg. W. of N. and in 1906 17 deg. 45' W. Such a variation seems\r\nto mean a change of many miles in the location of the north magnetic\r\npole. Certain changes in the daily march of electromagnetic phenomena\r\nover the oceans have led Bauer and his associates to suggest that the\r\nmagnetic poles may even be subject to a slight daily movement in\r\nresponse to the changes in the relative positions of the earth and sun.\r\nThus there seems to be a possibility that a pronounced change in the\r\nlocation of the magnetic pole in Permian times, for example, may have\r\nhad some connection with a shifting in the location of the belt of\r\nstorms. It must be clearly understood that there is as yet no evidence\r\nof any such change, and the matter is introduced merely to call\r\nattention to a possible line of investigation.\r\n\r\nAny hypothesis of Permian and Proterozoic glaciation must explain not\r\nonly the glaciation of low latitudes but the lack of glaciation and the\r\naccumulation of red desert beds in high latitudes. The facts already\r\npresented seem to explain this. Glaciation could not occur extensively\r\nin high latitudes partly because during most of the year the air was too\r\ncold to hold much moisture, but still more because the winds for the\r\nmost part must have blown outward from the cold northern areas and the\r\ncyclonic storm belt was pushed out of high latitudes. Because of these\r\nconditions precipitation was apparently limited to a relatively small\r\nnumber of storms during the summer. Hence great desert areas must have\r\nprevailed at high latitudes. Great aridity now prevails north of the\r\nHimalayas and related ranges, and red beds are accumulating in the\r\ncenters of the great deserts, such as those of the Tarim Basin and the\r\nTranscaspian. The redness is not due to the original character of the\r\nrock, but to intense oxidation, as appears from the fact that along the\r\nedges of the desert and wherever occasional floods carry sediment far\r\nout into the midst of the sand, the material has the ordinary brownish\r\nshades. As soon as one goes out into the places where the sand has been\r\nexposed to the air for a long time, however, it becomes pink, and then\r\nred. Such conditions may have given rise to the high degree of oxidation\r\nin the famous Permian red beds. If the air of the early Permian\r\ncontained an unusual percentage of oxygen because of the release of that\r\ngas by the great plant beds which formed coal in the preceding era, as\r\nChamberlin has thought probable, the tendency to produce red beds would\r\nbe still further increased.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that these conditions would absolutely\r\nlimit glaciation to subtropical latitudes. The presence of early Permian\r\nglaciation in North America at Boston and in Alaska and in the Falkland\r\nIslands of the South Atlantic Ocean proves that at least locally there\r\nwas sufficient moisture to form glaciers near the coast in relatively\r\nhigh latitudes. The possibility of this would depend entirely upon the\r\nform of the lands and the consequent course of ocean currents. Even in\r\nthose high latitudes cyclonic storms would occur unless they were kept\r\nout by conditions of pressure such as have been described above.\r\n\r\nThe marine faunas of Permian age in high latitudes have been interpreted\r\nas indicating mild oceanic temperatures. This is a point which requires\r\nfurther investigation. Warm oceans during times of slight solar activity\r\nare a necessary consequence of the cyclonic hypothesis, as will appear\r\nlater. The present cold oceans seem to be the expectable result of the\r\nPleistocene glaciation and of the present relatively disturbed condition\r\nof the sun. If a sudden disturbance threw the solar atmosphere into\r\nviolent commotion within a few thousand years during Permian times,\r\nglaciation might occur as described above, while the oceans were still\r\nwarm. In fact their warmth would increase evaporation while the violent\r\ncyclonic storms and high winds would cause heavy rain and keep the air\r\ncool by constantly raising it to high levels where it would rapidly\r\nradiate its heat into space.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it is not yet possible to determine how warm the oceans\r\nwere at the actual time of the Permian glaciation. Some faunas formerly\r\nreported as Permian are now known to be considerably older. Moreover,\r\nothers of undoubted Permian age are probably not strictly\r\ncontemporaneous with the glaciation. So far back in the geological\r\nrecord it is very doubtful whether we can date fossils within the limits\r\nof say 100,000 years. Yet a difference of 100,000 years would be more\r\nthan enough to allow the fossils to have lived either before or after\r\nthe glaciation, or in an inter-glacial epoch. One such epoch is known to\r\nhave occurred and nine others are suggested by the inter-stratification\r\nof glacial till and marine sediments in eastern Australia. The warm\r\ncurrents which would flow poleward in inter-glacial epochs must have\r\nfavored a prompt reintroduction of marine faunas driven out during times\r\nof glaciation. Taken all and all, the Permian glaciation seems to be\r\naccounted for by the cyclonic hypothesis quite as well as does the\r\nPleistocene. In both these cases, as well as in the various pulsations\r\nof historic times, it seems to be necessary merely to magnify what is\r\nhappening today in order to reproduce the conditions which prevailed in\r\nthe past. If the conditions which now prevail at times of sunspot minima\r\nwere magnified, they would give the mild conditions of inter-glacial\r\nepochs and similar periods. If the conditions which now prevail at times\r\nof sunspot maxima are magnified a little they seem to produce periods of\r\nclimatic stress such as those of the fourteenth century. If they are\r\nmagnified still more the result is apparently glacial epochs like those\r\nof the Pleistocene, and if they are magnified to a still greater extent,\r\nthe result is Permian or Proterozoic glaciation. Other factors must\r\nindeed be favorable, for climatic changes are highly complex and are\r\nunquestionably due to a combination of circumstances. The point which is\r\nchiefly emphasized in this book is that among those several\r\ncircumstances, changes in cyclonic storms due apparently to activity of\r\nthe sun's atmosphere must always be reckoned.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: W.

Somewhat peculiar climatic conditions evidently\r\nprevailed when it was formed. At present similar deposits are being laid\r\ndown only near the leeward margin of great deserts. The famous loess\r\ndeposits of China in the lee of the Desert of Gobi are examples. During\r\nthe Pleistocene period, however, loess accumulated in a broad zone along\r\nthe margin of the ice sheet at its maximum extent. In the Old World it\r\nextended from France across Germany and through the Black Earth region\r\nof Russia into Siberia. In the New World a still larger area is\r\nloess-covered. In the Mississippi Valley, tens of thousands of square\r\nmiles are mantled by a layer exceeding twenty feet in thickness and in\r\nmany places approaching a hundred feet. Neither the North American nor\r\nthe European deposits are associated with a desert. Indeed, loess is\r\nlacking in the western and drier parts of the great plains and is best\r\ndeveloped in the well-watered states of Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri.\r\nPart of the loess overlies the non-glacial materials of the great\r\ncentral plain, but the northern portions overlie the drift deposits of\r\nthe first three glaciations. A few traces of loess are associated with\r\nthe Kansan and Illinoian, the second and third glaciations, but most of\r\nthe America loess appears to have been formed at approximately the time\r\nof the Iowan or fourth glaciation, while only a little overlies the\r\ndrift sheets of the Wisconsin age. The loess is thickest near the margin\r\nof the Iowan till sheet and thins progressively both north and south.\r\nThe thinning southward is abrupt along the stream divides, but very\r\ngradual along the larger valleys. Indeed, loess is abundant along the\r\nbluffs of the Mississippi, especially the east bluff, almost to the Gulf\r\nof Mexico.[56]\r\n\r\nIt is now generally agreed that all typical loess is wind blown. There\r\nis still much question, however, as to its time of origin, and thus\r\nindirectly as to its climatic implications. Several American and\r\nEuropean students have thought that the loess dates from inter-glacial\r\ntimes. On the other hand, Penck has concluded that the loess was formed\r\nshortly before the commencement of the glacial epochs; while many\r\nAmerican geologists hold that the loess accumulated while the ice sheets\r\nwere at approximately their maximum size. W. J. McGee, Chamberlin and\r\nSalisbury, Keyes, and others lean toward this view. In this chapter the\r\nhypothesis is advanced that it was formed at the one other possible\r\ntime, namely, immediately following the retreat of the ice.\r\n\r\nThese four hypotheses as to the time of origin of loess imply the\r\nfollowing differences in its climatic relations. If loess was formed\r\nduring typical inter-glacial epochs, or toward the close of such epochs,\r\nprofound general aridity must seemingly have prevailed in order to kill\r\noff the vegetation and thus enable the wind to pick up sufficient dust.\r\nIf the loess was formed during times of extreme glaciation when the\r\nglaciers were supplying large quantities of fine material to outflowing\r\nstreams, less aridity would be required, but there must have been sharp\r\ncontrasts between wet seasons in summer when the snow was melting and\r\ndry seasons in winter when the storms were forced far south by the\r\nglacial high pressure. Alternate floods and droughts would thus affect\r\nbroad areas along the streams. Hence arises the hypothesis that the wind\r\nobtained the loess from the flood plains of streams at times of maximum\r\nglaciation. If the loess was formed during the rapid retreat of the ice,\r\nalternate summer floods and winter droughts would still prevail, but\r\nmuch material could also be obtained by the winds not only from flood\r\nplains, but also from the deposits exposed by the melting of the ice and\r\nnot yet covered by vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe evidence for and against the several hypotheses may be stated\r\nbriefly. In support of the hypothesis of the inter-glacial origin of\r\nloess, Shimek and others state that the glacial drift which lies beneath\r\nthe loess commonly gives evidence that some time elapsed between the\r\ndisappearance of the ice and the deposition of the loess. For example,\r\nabundant shells of land snails in the loess are not of the sort now\r\nfound in colder regions, but resemble those found in the drier regions.\r\nIt is probable that if they represented a glacial epoch they would be\r\ndepauperated by the cold as are the snails of far northern regions. The\r\ngravel pavement discussed below seems to be strong evidence of erosion\r\nbetween the retreat of the ice and the deposition of the loess.\r\n\r\nTurning to the second hypothesis, namely, that the loess accumulated\r\nnear the close of the inter-glacial epoch rather than in the midst of\r\nit, we may follow Penck. The mammalian fossils seem to him to prove that\r\nthe loess was formed while boreal animals occupied the region, for they\r\ninclude remains of the hairy mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, and reindeer.\r\nOn the other hand, the typical inter-glacial beds not far away yield\r\nremains of species characteristic of milder climates, such as the\r\nelephant, the smaller rhinoceros, and the deer. In connection with these\r\nfacts it should be noted that occasional remains of tundra vegetation\r\nand of trees are found beneath the loess, while in the loess itself\r\ncertain steppe animals, such as the common gopher or spermaphyl, are\r\nfound. Penck interprets this as indicating a progressive desiccation\r\nculminating just before the oncoming of the next ice sheet.\r\n\r\nThe evidence advanced in favor of the hypothesis that the loess was\r\nformed when glaciation was near its maximum includes the fact that if\r\nthe loess does not represent the outwash from the Iowan ice, there is\r\nlittle else that does, and presumably there must have been outwash. Also\r\nthe distribution of loess along the margins of streams suggests that\r\nmuch of the material came from the flood plains of overloaded streams\r\nflowing from the melting ice.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are some points in favor of the hypothesis that the loess\r\noriginated (1) in strictly inter-glacial times, (2) at the end of\r\ninter-glacial epochs, and (3) at times of full glaciation, each\r\nhypothesis is much weakened by evidence that supports the others. The\r\nevidence of boreal animals seems to disprove the hypothesis that the\r\nloess was formed in the middle of a mild inter-glacial epoch. On the\r\nother hand, Penck's hypothesis as to loess at the end of inter-glacial\r\ntimes fails to account for certain characteristics of the lowest part of\r\nthe loess deposits and of the underlying topography. Instead of normal\r\nvalleys and consequent prompt drainage such as ought to have developed\r\nbefore the end of a long inter-glacial epoch, the surface on which the\r\nloess lies shows many undrained depressions. Some of these can be seen\r\nin exposed banks, while many more are inferred from the presence of\r\nshells of pond snails here and there in the overlying loess. The pond\r\nsnails presumably lived in shallow pools occupying depressions in the\r\nuneven surface left by the ice. Another reason for questioning whether\r\nthe loess was formed at the end of an inter-glacial epoch is that this\r\nhypothesis does not provide a reasonable origin for the material which\r\ncomposes the loess. Near the Alps where the loess deposits are small and\r\nwhere glaciers probably persisted in the inter-glacial epochs and thus\r\nsupplied flood plain material in large quantities, this does not appear\r\nimportant. In the broad upper Mississippi Basin, however, and also in\r\nthe Black Earth region of Russia there seems to be no way to get the\r\nlarge body of material composing the loess except by assuming the\r\nexistence of great deserts to windward. But there seems to be little or\r\nno evidence of such deserts where they could be effective. The\r\nmineralogical character of the loess of Iowan age proves that the\r\nmaterial came from granitic rocks, such as formed a large part of the\r\ndrift. The nearest extensive outcrops of granite are in the southwestern\r\npart of the United States, nearly a thousand miles from Iowa and\r\nIllinois. But the loess is thickest near the ice margin and thins toward\r\nthe southwest and in other directions, whereas if its source were the\r\nsouthwestern desert, its maximum thickness would probably be near the\r\nmargin of the desert.\r\n\r\nThe evidence cited above seems inconsistent not only with the hypothesis\r\nthat the loess was formed at the end of an inter-glacial epoch, but also\r\nwith the idea that it originated at times of maximum glaciation either\r\nfrom river-borne sediments or from any other source. A further and more\r\nconvincing reason for this last conclusion is the probability and almost\r\nthe certainty that when the ice advanced, its front lay close to areas\r\nwhere the vegetation was not much thinner than that which today prevails\r\nunder similar climatic conditions. If the average temperature of glacial\r\nmaxima was only 6 deg.C. lower than that of today, the conditions just\r\nbeyond the ice front when it was in the loess region from southern\r\nIllinois to Minnesota would have been like those now prevailing in\r\nCanada from New Brunswick to Winnipeg. The vegetation there is quite\r\ndifferent from the grassy, semi-arid vegetation of which evidence is\r\nfound in the loess. The roots and stalks of such grassy vegetation are\r\ngenerally agreed to have helped produce the columnar structure which\r\nenables the loess to stand with almost vertical surfaces.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to consider the probability that loess accumulated\r\nmainly during the retreat of the ice. Such a retreat exposed a zone of\r\ndrift to the outflowing glacial winds. Most glacial hypotheses, such as\r\nthat of uplift, or depleted carbon dioxide, call for a gradual retreat\r\nof the ice scarcely faster than the vegetation could advance into the\r\nabandoned area. Under the solar-cyclonic hypothesis, on the other hand,\r\nthe climatic changes may have been sudden and hence the retreat of the\r\nice may have been much more rapid than the advance of vegetation. Now\r\nwind-blown materials are derived from places where vegetation is scanty.\r\nScanty vegetation on good soil, it is true, is usually due to aridity,\r\nbut may also result because the time since the soil was exposed to the\r\nair has not been long enough for the soil to be sufficiently weathered\r\nto support vegetation. Even when weathering has had full opportunity, as\r\nwhen sand bars, mud flats, and flood plains are exposed, vegetation\r\ntakes root only slowly. Moreover, storms and violent winds may prevent\r\nthe spread of vegetation, as is seen on sandy beaches even in distinctly\r\nhumid regions like New Jersey and Denmark. Thus it appears that unless\r\nthe retreat of the ice were as slow as the advance of vegetation, a\r\nbarren area of more or less width must have bordered the retreating ice\r\nand formed an ideal source of loess.\r\n\r\nSeveral other lines of evidence seemingly support the conclusion that\r\nthe loess was formed during the retreat of the ice. For example, Shimek,\r\nwho has made almost a lifelong study of the Iowan loess, emphasizes the\r\nfact that there is often an accumulation of stones and pebbles at its\r\nbase. This suggests that the underlying till was eroded before the loess\r\nwas deposited upon it. The first reaction of most students is to assume\r\nthat of course this was due to running water. That is possible in many\r\ncases, but by no means in all. So widespread a sheet of gravel could not\r\nbe deposited by streams without destroying the irregular basins and\r\nhollows of which we have seen evidence where the loess lies on glacial\r\ndeposits. On the other hand, the wind is competent to produce a similar\r\ngravel pavement without disturbing the old topography. \"Desert\r\npavements\" are a notable feature in most deserts. On the edges of an ice\r\nsheet, as Hobbs has made us realize, the commonest winds are outward.\r\nThey often attain a velocity of eighty miles an hour in Antarctica and\r\nGreenland. Such winds, however, usually decline rapidly in velocity only\r\na few score miles from the ice. Thus their effect would be to produce\r\nrapid erosion of the freshly bared surface near the retreating ice. The\r\npebbles would be left behind as a pavement, while sand and then loess\r\nwould be deposited farther from the ice where the winds were weaker and\r\nwhere vegetation was beginning to take root. Such a decrease in wind\r\nvelocity may explain the occasional vertical gradation from gravel\r\nthrough sand to coarse loess and then to normal fine loess. As the ice\r\nsheet retreated the wind in any given place would gradually become less\r\nviolent. As the ice continued to retreat the area where loess was\r\ndeposited would follow at a distance, and thus each part of the gravel\r\npavement would in turn be covered with the loess.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that loess is deposited while the ice is retreating is in\r\naccord with many other lines of evidence. For example, it accords with\r\nthe boreal character of the mammal remains as described above. Again,\r\nthe advance of vegetation into the barren zone along the front of the\r\nice would be delayed by the strong outblowing winds. The common pioneer\r\nplants depend largely on the wind for the distribution of their seeds,\r\nbut the glacial winds would carry them away from the ice rather than\r\ntoward it. The glacial winds discourage the advance of vegetation in\r\nanother way, for they are drying winds, as are almost all winds blowing\r\nfrom a colder to a warmer region. The fact that remains of trees\r\nsometimes occur at the bottom of the loess probably means that the\r\ndeposition of loess extended into the forests which almost certainly\r\npersisted not far from the ice. This seems more likely than that a\r\nperiod of severe aridity before the advance of the ice killed the trees\r\nand made a steppe or desert. Penck's chief argument in favor of the\r\nformation of loess before the advance of the ice rather than after, is\r\nthat since loess is lacking upon the youngest drift sheet in Europe it\r\nmust have been formed before rather than after the last or Wuerm advance\r\nof the ice. This breaks down on two counts. First, on the corresponding\r\n(Wisconsin) drift sheet in America, loess is present,--in small\r\nquantities to be sure, but unmistakably present. Second, there is no\r\nreason to assume that conditions were identical at each advance and\r\nretreat of the ice. Indeed, the fact that in Europe, as in the United\r\nStates, nearly all the loess was formed at one time, and only a little\r\nis associated with the other ice advances, points clearly against\r\nPenck's fundamental assumption that the accumulation of loess was due to\r\nthe approach of a cold climate.\r\n\r\nHaving seen that the loess was probably formed during the retreat of the\r\nice, we are now ready to inquire what conditions the cyclonic hypothesis\r\nwould postulate in the loess areas during the various stages of a\r\nglacial cycle. Fig. 2, in Chapter IV, gives the best idea of what would\r\napparently happen in North America, and events in Europe would\r\npresumably be similar. During the nine maximum years on which Fig. 2 is\r\nbased the sunspot numbers averaged seventy, while during the nine\r\nminimum years they averaged less than five. It seems fair to suppose\r\nthat the maximum years represent the average conditions which prevailed\r\nin the past at times when the sun was in a median stage between the full\r\nactivity which led to glaciation and the mild activity of the minimum\r\nyears which appear to represent inter-glacial conditions. This would\r\nmean that when a glacial period was approaching, but before an ice sheet\r\nhad accumulated to any great extent, a crescent-shaped strip from\r\nMontana through Illinois to Maine would suffer a diminution in\r\nstorminess ranging up to 60 per cent as compared with inter-glacial\r\nconditions. This is in strong contrast with an increase in storminess\r\namounting to 75 or even 100 per cent both in the boreal storm belt in\r\nCanada and in the subtropical belt in the Southwest. Such a decrease in\r\nstorminess in the central United States would apparently be most\r\nnoticeable in summer, as is shown in _Earth and Sun_. Hence it would\r\nhave a maximum effect in producing aridity. This would favor the\r\nformation of loess, but it is doubtful whether the aridity would become\r\nextreme enough to explain such vast deposits as are found throughout\r\nlarge parts of the Mississippi Basin. That would demand that hundreds of\r\nthousands of square miles should become almost absolute desert, and it\r\nis not probable that any such thing occurred. Nevertheless, according to\r\nthe cyclonic hypothesis the period immediately before the advent of the\r\nice would be relatively dry in the central United States, and to that\r\nextent favorable to the work of the wind.\r\n\r\nAs the climatic conditions became more severe and the ice sheet\r\nexpanded, the dryness and lack of storms would apparently diminish. The\r\nreason, as has been explained, would be the gradual pushing of the\r\nstorms southward by the high-pressure area which would develop over the\r\nice sheet. Thus at the height of a glacial epoch there would apparently\r\nbe great storminess in the area where the loess is found, especially in\r\nsummer. Hence the cyclonic hypothesis does not accord with the idea of\r\ngreat deposition of loess at the time of maximum glaciation.\r\n\r\nFinally we come to the time when the ice was retreating. We have already\r\nseen that not only the river flood plains, but also vast areas of fresh\r\nglacial deposits would be exposed to the winds, and would remain without\r\nvegetation for a long time. At that very time the retreat of the ice\r\nsheet would tend to permit the storms to follow paths determined by the\r\ndegree of solar activity, in place of the far southerly paths to which\r\nthe high atmospheric pressure over the expanded ice sheet had previously\r\nforced them. In other words, the conditions shown in Fig. 2 would tend\r\nto reappear when the sun's activity was diminishing and the ice sheet\r\nwas retreating, just as they had appeared when the sun was becoming more\r\nactive and the ice sheet was advancing. This time, however, the\r\nsemi-arid conditions arising from the scarcity of storms would prevail\r\nin a region of glacial deposits and widely spreading river deposits, few\r\nor none of which would be covered with vegetation. The conditions would\r\nbe almost ideal for eolian erosion and for the transportation of loess\r\nby the wind to areas a little more remote from the ice where grassy\r\nvegetation had made a start.\r\n\r\nThe cyclonic hypothesis also seems to offer a satisfactory explanation\r\nof variations in the amount of loess associated with the several glacial\r\nepochs. It attributes these to differences in the rate of disappearance\r\nof the ice, which in turn varied with the rate of decline of solar\r\nactivity and storminess. This is supposed to be the reason why the Iowan\r\nloess deposits are much more extensive than those of the other epochs,\r\nfor the Iowan ice sheet presumably accomplished part of its retreat much\r\nmore suddenly than the other ice sheets.[57] The more sudden the\r\nretreat, the greater the barren area where the winds could gather fine\r\nbits of dust. Temporary readvances may also have been so distributed and\r\nof such intensity that they frequently accentuated the condition shown\r\nin Fig. 2, thus making the central United States dry soon after the\r\nexposure of great amounts of glacial debris. The closeness with which\r\nthe cyclonic hypothesis accords with the facts as to the loess is one of\r\nthe pleasant surprises of the hypothesis. The first draft of Fig. 2 and\r\nthe first outlines of the hypothesis were framed without thought of the\r\nloess. Yet so far as can now be seen, both agree closely with the\r\nconditions of loess formation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Chamberlin and Salisbury: Geology, 1906, Vol. III, pp.\r\n405-412.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: It may have retreated soon after reaching its maximum.

Everyone sees the necessity of explaining\r\nconditions different from those that now exist, but few realize that\r\npresent conditions may be abnormal, and that they need explanation just\r\nas much as do others. Because of this tendency glaciation has been\r\ndiscussed with the greatest fullness, while there has been much neglect\r\nnot only of the periods when the climate of the earth resembled that of\r\nthe present, but also of the vastly longer periods when it was even\r\nmilder than now.\r\n\r\nHow important the periods of mild climate have been in geological times\r\nmay be judged from the relative length of glacial compared with\r\ninter-glacial epochs, and still more from the far greater relative\r\nlength of the mild parts of periods and eras when compared with the\r\nsevere parts. Recent estimates by R. T. Chamberlin[58] indicate that\r\naccording to the consensus of opinion among geologists the average\r\ninter-glacial epoch during the Pleistocene was about five times as long\r\nas the average glacial epoch, while the whole of a given glacial epoch\r\naveraged five times as long as the period when the ice was at a maximum.\r\nClimatic periods far milder, longer, and more monotonous than any\r\ninter-glacial epoch appear repeatedly during the course of geological\r\nhistory. Our task in this chapter is to explain them.\r\n\r\nKnowlton[59] has done geology a great service by collecting the evidence\r\nas to the mild type of climate which has again and again prevailed in\r\nthe past. He lays special stress on botanical evidence since that\r\npertains to the variable atmosphere of the lands, and hence furnishes a\r\nbetter guide than does the evidence of animals that lived in the\r\nrelatively unchanging water of the oceans. The nature of the evidence\r\nhas already been indicated in various parts of this book. It includes\r\npalms, tree ferns, and a host of other plants which once grew in regions\r\nwhich are now much too cold to support them. With this must be placed\r\nthe abundant reef-building corals and other warmth-loving marine\r\ncreatures in latitudes now much too cold for them. Of a piece with this\r\nare the conditions of inter-glacial epochs in Europe, for example, when\r\nelephants and hippopotamuses, as well as many species of plants from low\r\nlatitudes, were abundant. These conditions indicate not only that the\r\nclimate was warmer than now, but that the contrast from season to season\r\nwas much less. Indeed, Knowlton goes so far as to say that \"relative\r\nuniformity, mildness, and comparative equability of climate, accompanied\r\nby high humidity, have prevailed over the greater part of the earth,\r\nextending to, or into, polar circles, during the greater part of\r\ngeologic time--since, at least, the Middle Paleozoic. This is the\r\nregular, the ordinary, the normal condition.\" ... \"By many it is thought\r\nthat one of the strongest arguments against a gradually cooling globe\r\nand a humid, non-zonally disposed climate in the ages before the\r\nPleistocene is the discovery of evidences of glacial action practically\r\nthroughout the entire geologic column. Hardly less than a dozen of these\r\nare now known, ranging in age from Huronian to Eocene. It seems to be a\r\nvery general assumption by those who hold this view that these evidences\r\nof glacial activities are to be classed as ice ages, largely comparable\r\nin effect and extent to the Pleistocene refrigeration, but as a matter\r\nof fact only three are apparently of a magnitude to warrant such\r\ndesignation. These are the Huronian glaciation, that of the\r\n'Permo-Carboniferous,' and that of the Pleistocene. The others, so far\r\nas available data go, appear to be explainable as more or less local\r\nmanifestations that had no widespread effect on, for instance, ocean\r\ntemperatures, distribution of life, et cetera. They might well have been\r\nof the type of ordinary mountain glaciers, due entirely to local\r\nelevation and precipitation.\" ... \"If the sun had been the principal\r\nsource of heat in pre-Pleistocene time, terrestrial temperatures would\r\nof necessity have been disposed in zones, whereas the whole trend of\r\nthis paper has been the presentation of proof that these temperatures\r\nwere distinctly non-zonal. Therefore it seems to follow that the sun--at\r\nleast the present small-angle sun--could not have been the sole or even\r\nthe principal source of heat that warmed the early oceans.\"\r\n\r\nKnowlton is so strongly impressed by the widespread fossil floras that\r\nusually occur in the middle parts of the geological periods, that as\r\nSchuchert[3] puts it, he neglects the evidence of other kinds. In the\r\nmiddle of the periods and eras the expansion of the warm oceans over the\r\ncontinents was greatest, while the lands were small and hence had more\r\nor less insular climates of the oceanic type. At such times, the marine\r\nfauna agrees with the flora in indicating a mild climate. Large\r\ncolony-forming foraminifera, stony corals, shelled cephalopods,\r\ngastropods and thick-shelled bivalves, generally the cemented forms,\r\nwere common in the Far North and even in the Arctic. This occurred in\r\nthe Silurian, Devonian, Pennsylvanian, and Jurassic periods, yet at\r\nother times, such as the Cretaceous and Eocene, such forms were very\r\ngreatly reduced in variety in the northern regions or else wholly\r\nabsent. These things, as Schuchert[60] says, can only mean that Knowlton\r\nis right when he states that \"climatic zoning such as we have had since\r\nthe beginning of the Pleistocene did not obtain in the geologic ages\r\nprior to the Pleistocene.\" It does not mean, however, that there was a\r\n\"non-zonal arrangement\" and that the temperature of the oceans was\r\neverywhere the same and \"without widespread effect on the distribution\r\nof life.\"\r\n\r\nStudents of paleontology hold that as far back as we can go in the study\r\nof plants, there are evidences of seasons and of relatively cool\r\nclimates in high latitudes. The cycads, for instance, are one of the\r\ntypes most often used as evidence of a warm climate. Yet Wieland,[61]\r\nwho has made a lifelong study of these plants, says that many of them\r\n\"might well grow in temperate to cool climates. Until far more is\r\nlearned about them they should at least be held as valueless as indices\r\nof tropic climates.\" The inference is \"that either they or their close\r\nrelatives had the capacity to live in every clime. There is also a\r\nsuspicion that study of the associated ferns may compel revision of the\r\nlong-accepted view of the universality of tropic climates throughout the\r\nMesozoic.\" Nathorst is quoted by Wieland as saying, \"I think ... that\r\nduring the time when the Gingkophytes and Cycadophytes dominated, many\r\nof them must have adapted themselves for living in cold climates also.\r\nOf this I have not the least doubt.\"\r\n\r\nAnother important line of evidence which Knowlton and others have cited\r\nas a proof of the non-zonal arrangement of climate in the past, is the\r\nvast red beds which are found in the Proterozoic, late Silurian,\r\nDevonian, Permian, and Triassic, and in some Tertiary formations. These\r\nare believed to resemble laterite, a red and highly oxidized soil which\r\nis found in great abundance in equatorial regions. Knowlton does not\r\nattempt to show that the red beds present equatorial characteristics in\r\nother respects, but bases his conclusion on the statement that \"red beds\r\nare not being formed at the present time in any desert region.\" This is\r\ncertainly an error. As has already been said, in both the Transcaspian\r\nand Takla Makan deserts, the color of the sand regularly changes from\r\nbrown on the borders to pale red far out in the desert. Kuzzil Kum, or\r\nRed Sand, is the native name. The sands in the center of the desert\r\napparently were originally washed down from the same mountains as those\r\non the borders, and time has turned them red. Since the same condition\r\nis reported from the Arabian Desert, it seems that redness is\r\ncharacteristic of some of the world's greatest deserts. Moreover, beds\r\nof salt and gypsum are regularly found in red beds, and they can\r\nscarcely originate except in deserts, or in shallow almost landlocked\r\nbays on the coasts of deserts, as appears to have happened in the\r\nSilurian where marine fossils are found interbedded with gypsum.\r\n\r\nAgain, Knowlton says that red beds cannot indicate deserts because the\r\nplants found in them are not \"pinched or depauperate, nor do they\r\nindicate xerophytic adaptations. Moreover, very considerable deposits of\r\ncoal are found in red beds in many parts of the world, which implies the\r\npresence of swamps but little above sea-level.\"\r\n\r\nStudents of desert botany are likely to doubt the force of these\r\nconsiderations. As MacDougal[62] has shown, the variety of plants in\r\ndeserts is greater than in moist regions. Not only do xerophytic desert\r\nspecies prevail, but halophytes are present in the salty areas, and\r\nhygrophytes in the wet swampy areas, while ordinary mesophytes prevail\r\nalong the water courses and are washed down from the mountains. The\r\nordinary plants, not the xerophytes, are the ones that are chiefly\r\npreserved since they occur in most abundance near streams where\r\ndeposition is taking place. So far as swamps are concerned, few are of\r\nlarger size than those of Seistan in Persia, Lop Nor in Chinese\r\nTurkestan, and certain others in the midst of the Asiatic deserts.\r\nStreams flowing from the mountains into deserts are almost sure to form\r\nlarge swamps, such as those along the Tarim River in central Asia. Lake\r\nChad in Africa is another example. In it, too, reeds are very numerous.\r\n\r\nPutting together the evidence on both sides in this disputed question,\r\nit appears that throughout most of geological time there is some\r\nevidence of a zonal arrangement of climate. The evidence takes the form\r\nof traces of cool climates, of seasons, and of deserts. Nevertheless,\r\nthere is also strong evidence that these conditions were in general less\r\nintense than at present and that times of relatively warm, moist climate\r\nwithout great seasonal extremes have prevailed very widely during\r\nperiods much longer than those when a zonal arrangement as marked as\r\nthat of today prevailed. As Schuchert[63] puts it: \"Today the variation\r\non land between the tropics and the poles is roughly between 110 deg. and\r\n-60 deg.F., in the oceans between 85 deg. and 31 deg.F. In the geologic past the\r\ntemperature of the oceans for the greater parts of the periods probably\r\nwas most often between 85 deg. and 55 deg.F., while on land it may have varied\r\nbetween 90 deg. and 0 deg.F. At rare intervals the extremes were undoubtedly as\r\ngreat as they are today. The conclusion is therefore that at all times\r\nthe earth had temperature zones, varying between the present-day\r\nintensity and times which were almost without such belts, and at these\r\nlatter times the greater part of the earth had an almost uniformly mild\r\nclimate, without winters.\"\r\n\r\nIt is these mild climates which we must now attempt to explain. This\r\nleads us to inquire what would happen to the climate of the earth as a\r\nwhole if the conditions which now prevail at times of few sunspots were\r\nto become intensified. That they could become greatly intensified seems\r\nhighly probable, for there is good reason to think that aside from the\r\nsunspot cycle the sun's atmosphere is in a disturbed condition. The\r\nprominences which sometimes shoot out hundreds of thousands of miles\r\nseem to be good evidence of this. Suppose that the sun's atmosphere\r\nshould become very quiet. This would apparently mean that cyclonic\r\nstorms would be much less numerous and less severe than during the\r\npresent times of sunspot minima. The storms would also apparently follow\r\npaths in middle latitudes somewhat as they do now when sunspots are\r\nfewest. The first effect of such a condition, if we can judge from what\r\nhappens at present, would be a rise in the general temperature of the\r\nearth, because less heat would be carried aloft by storms. Today, as is\r\nshown in _Earth and Sun_, a difference of perhaps 10 per cent in the\r\naverage storminess during periods of sunspot maxima and minima is\r\ncorrelated with a difference of 3 deg.C. in the temperature at the earth's\r\nsurface. This includes not only an actual lowering of 0.6 deg.C. at times of\r\nsunspot maxima, but the overcoming of the effect of increased insolation\r\nat such times, an effect which Abbot calculates as about 2.5 deg.C. If the\r\nstorminess were to be reduced to one-half or one-quarter its present\r\namount at sunspot minima, not only would the loss of heat by upward\r\nconvection in storms be diminished, but the area covered by clouds would\r\ndiminish so that the sun would have more chance to warm the lower air.\r\nHence the average rise of temperature might amount to as much at 5 deg. or\r\n10 deg.C.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of the decrease in storminess would be to make the\r\nso-called westerly winds, which are chiefly southwesterly in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere and northwesterly in the southern hemisphere, more\r\nstrong and steady than at present. They would not continually suffer\r\ninterruption by cyclonic winds from other directions, as is now the\r\ncase, and would have a regularity like that of the trades. This\r\nconclusion is strongly reenforced in a paper by Clayton[64] which came\r\nto hand after this chapter had been completed. From his studies of the\r\nsolar constant and the temperature of the earth which are described in\r\n_Earth and Sun_, he reaches the following conclusion: \"The results of\r\nthese researches have led me to believe: 1. That if there were no\r\nvariation in solar radiation the atmospheric motions would establish a\r\nstable system with exchanges of air between equator and pole and between\r\nocean and land, in which the only variations would be daily and annual\r\nchanges set in operation by the relative motions of the earth and sun.\r\n2. The existing abnormal changes, which we call weather, have their\r\norigins chiefly, if not entirely, in the variations of solar radiation.\"\r\n\r\nIf cyclonic storms and \"weather\" were largely eliminated and if the\r\nplanetary system of winds with its steady trades and southwesterlies\r\nbecame everywhere dominant, the regularity and volume of the\r\npoleward-flowing currents, such as the Gulf Stream and the Atlantic\r\nDrift in one ocean, and the Japanese Current in another, would be\r\ngreatly increased. How important this is may be judged from the work of\r\nHelland-Hansen and Nansen.[65] These authors find that with the passage\r\nof each cyclonic storm there is a change in the temperature of the\r\nsurface water of the Atlantic Ocean. Winds at right angles to the course\r\nof the Drift drive the water first in one direction and then in the\r\nother but do not advance it in its course. Winds with an easterly\r\ncomponent, on the other hand, not only check the Drift but reverse it,\r\ndriving the warm water back toward the southwest and allowing cold water\r\nto well up in its stead. The driving force in the Atlantic Drift is\r\nmerely the excess of the winds with a westerly component over those with\r\nan easterly component.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the numbers in Fig. 8 represent the strength of the winds\r\nin a certain part of the North Atlantic or North Pacific, that is, the\r\ntotal number of miles moved by the air per year. In quadrant A of the\r\nleft-hand part all the winds move from a more or less southwesterly\r\ndirection and produce a total movement of the air amounting to thirty\r\nunits per year. Those coming from points between north and west move\r\ntwenty-five units; those between north and east, twenty units; and those\r\nbetween east and south, twenty-five units. Since the movement of the\r\nwinds in quadrants B and D is the same, these winds have no effect in\r\nproducing currents. They merely move the water back and forth, and thus\r\ngive it time to lose whatever heat it has brought from more southerly\r\nlatitudes. On the other hand, since the easterly winds in quadrant C do\r\nnot wholly check the currents caused by the westerly winds of quadrant\r\nA, the effective force of the westerly winds amounts to ten, or the\r\ndifference between a force of thirty in quadrant A and of twenty in\r\nquadrant C. Hence the water is moved forward toward the northeast, as\r\nshown by the thick part of arrow A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 8. Effect of diminution of storms on movement of\r\nwater._]\r\n\r\nNow suppose that cyclonic storms should be greatly reduced in number so\r\nthat in the zone of prevailing westerlies they were scarcely more\r\nnumerous than tropical hurricanes now are in the trade-wind belt. Then\r\nthe more or less southwesterly winds in quadrant A' in the right-hand\r\npart of Fig. 8 would not only become more frequent but would be stronger\r\nthan at present. The total movement from that quarter might rise to\r\nsixty units, as indicated in the figure. In quadrants B' and D' the\r\nmovement would fall to fifteen and in quadrant C' to ten. B' and D'\r\nwould balance one another as before. The movement in A', however, would\r\nexceed that in C' by fifty instead of ten. In other words, the\r\ncurrent-making force would become five times as great as now. The actual\r\neffect would be increased still more, for the winds from the southwest\r\nwould be stronger as well as steadier if there were no storms. A strong\r\nwind which causes whitecaps has much more power to drive the water\r\nforward than a weaker wind which does not cause whitecaps. In a wave\r\nwithout a whitecap the water returns to practically the original point\r\nafter completing a circle beneath the surface. In a wave with a\r\nwhitecap, however, the cap moves forward. Any increase in velocity\r\nbeyond the rate at which whitecaps are formed has a great influence upon\r\nthe amount of water which is blown forward. Several times as much water\r\nis drifted forward by a persistent wind of twenty miles an hour as by a\r\nten-mile wind.[66]\r\n\r\nIn this connection a suggestion which is elaborated in Chapter XIII may\r\nbe mentioned. At present the salinity of the oceans checks the general\r\ndeep-sea circulation and thereby increases the contrasts from zone to\r\nzone. In the past, however, the ocean must have been fresher than now.\r\nHence the circulation was presumably less impeded, and the transfer of\r\nheat from low latitudes to high was facilitated.\r\n\r\nConsider now the magnitude of the probable effect of a diminution in\r\nstorms. Today off the coast of Norway in latitude 65 deg.N. and longitude\r\n10 deg.E., the mean temperature in January is 2 deg.C. and in July 12 deg.C. This\r\nrepresents a plus anomaly of about 22 deg. in January and 2 deg. in July; that\r\nis, the Norwegian coast is warmer than the normal for its latitude by\r\nthese amounts. Suppose that in some past time the present distribution\r\nof lands and seas prevailed, but Norway was a lowland where extensive\r\ndeposits could accumulate in great flood plains. Suppose, also, that the\r\nsun's atmosphere was so inactive that few cyclonic storms occurred,\r\nsteady winds from the west-southwest prevailed, and strong,\r\nuninterrupted ocean currents brought from the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of\r\nMexico much greater supplies of warm water than at present. The\r\nNorwegian winters would then be warmer than now not only because of the\r\ngeneral increase in temperature which the earth regularly experiences at\r\nsunspot minima, but because the currents would accentuate this\r\ncondition. In summer similar conditions would prevail except that the\r\nwarming effect of the winds and currents would presumably be less than\r\nin winter, but this might be more than balanced by the increased heat of\r\nthe sun during the long summer days, for storms and clouds would be\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nIf such conditions raised the winter temperature only 8 deg.C. and the\r\nsummer temperature 4 deg.C., the climate would be as warm as that of the\r\nnorthern island of New Zealand (latitude 35 deg.-43 deg.S.). The flora of that\r\npart of New Zealand is subtropical and includes not only pines and\r\nbeeches, but palms and tree ferns. A climate scarcely warmer than that\r\nof New Zealand would foster a flora like that which existed in far\r\nnorthern latitudes during some of the milder geological periods. If,\r\nhowever, the general temperature of the earth's surface were raised 5 deg.\r\nbecause of the scarcity of storms, if the currents were strong enough so\r\nthat they increased the present anomaly by 50 per cent, and if more\r\npersistent sunshine in summer raised the temperature at that season\r\nabout 4 deg.C., the January temperature would be 18 deg.C. and the July\r\ntemperature 22 deg.C. These figures perhaps make summer and winter more\r\nnearly alike than was ever really the case in such latitudes.\r\nNevertheless, they show that a diminution of storms and a consequent\r\nstrengthening and steadying of the southwesterlies might easily raise\r\nthe temperature of the Norwegian coast so high that corals could\r\nflourish within the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nAnother factor would cooeperate in producing mild temperatures in high\r\nlatitudes during the winter, namely, the fogs which would presumably\r\naccumulate. It is well known that when saturated air from a warm ocean\r\nis blown over the lands in winter, as happens so often in the British\r\nIslands and around the North Sea, fog is formed. The effect of such a\r\nfog is indeed to shut out the sun's radiation, but in high latitudes\r\nduring the winter when the sun is low, this is of little importance.\r\nAnother effect is to retain the heat of the earth itself. When a\r\nconstant supply of warm water is being brought from low latitudes this\r\nblanketing of the heat by the fog becomes of great importance. In the\r\npast, whenever cyclonic storms were weak and westerly winds were\r\ncorrespondingly strong, winter fogs in high latitudes must have been\r\nmuch more widespread and persistent than now.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of fogs on vegetation is another interesting point. If a\r\nregion in high latitudes is constantly protected by fog in winter, it\r\ncan support types of vegetation characteristic of fairly low latitudes,\r\nfor plants are oftener killed by dry cold than by moist cold. Indeed,\r\nexcessive evaporation from the plant induced by dry cold when the\r\nevaporated water cannot be rapidly replaced by the movement of sap is a\r\nchief reason why large plants are winterkilled. The growing of\r\ntransplanted palms on the coast of southwestern Ireland, in spite of its\r\nlocation in latitude 50 deg.N., is possible only because of the great\r\nfogginess in winter due to the marine climate. The fogs prevent the\r\nescape of heat and ward off killing frosts. The tree ferns in latitude\r\n46 deg.S. in New Zealand, already referred to, are often similarly protected\r\nin winter. Therefore, the relative frequency of fogs in high latitudes\r\nwhen storms were at a minimum would apparently tend not merely to\r\nproduce mild winters but to promote tropical vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe strong steady trades and southwesterlies which would prevail at\r\ntimes of slight solar activity, according to our hypothesis, would have\r\na pronounced effect on the water of the deep seas as well as upon that\r\nof the surface. In the first place, the deep-sea circulation would be\r\nhastened. For convenience let us speak of the northern hemisphere. In\r\nthe past, whenever the southwesterly winds were steadier than now, as\r\nwas probably the case when cyclonic storms were relatively rare, more\r\nsurface water than at present was presumably driven from low latitudes\r\nand carried to high latitudes. This, of course, means that a greater\r\nvolume of water had to flow back toward the equator in the lower parts\r\nof the ocean, or else as a cool surface current. The steady\r\nsouthwesterly winds, however, would interfere with south-flowing surface\r\ncurrents, thus compelling the polar waters to find their way equatorward\r\nbeneath the surface. In low latitudes the polar waters would rise and\r\ntheir tendency would be to lower the temperature. Hence steadier\r\nwesterlies would make for lessened latitudinal contrasts in climate not\r\nonly by driving more warm water poleward but by causing more polar water\r\nto reach low latitudes.\r\n\r\nAt this point a second important consideration must be faced. Not only\r\nwould the deep-sea circulation be hastened, but the ocean depths might\r\nbe warmed. The deep parts of the ocean are today cold because they\r\nreceive their water from high latitudes where it sinks because of low\r\ntemperature. Suppose, however, that a diminution in storminess combined\r\nwith other conditions should permit corals to grow in latitude 70 deg.N. The\r\nocean temperature would then have to average scarcely lower than 20 deg.C.\r\nand even in the coldest month the water could scarcely fall below about\r\n15 deg.C. Under such conditions, if the polar ocean were freely connected\r\nwith the rest of the oceans, no part of it would probably have a\r\ntemperature much below 10 deg.C., for there would be no such thing as ice\r\ncaps and snowfields to reflect the scanty sunlight and radiate into\r\nspace what little heat there was. On the contrary, during the winter an\r\nalmost constant state of dense fogginess would prevail. So great would\r\nbe the blanketing effect of this that a minimum monthly temperature of\r\n10 deg.C. for the coldest part of the ocean may perhaps be too low for a\r\ntime when corals thrived in latitude 70 deg..\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the ocean depths cannot permanently remain lower than\r\nthat of the coldest parts of the surface. Temporarily this might indeed\r\nhappen when a solar change first reduced the storminess and strengthened\r\nthe westerlies and the surface currents. Gradually, however, the\r\npersistent deep-sea circulation would bring up the colder water in low\r\nlatitudes and carry downward the water of medium temperature at the\r\ncoldest part of the surface. Thus in time the whole body of the ocean\r\nwould become warm. The heat which at present is carried away from the\r\nearth's surface in storms would slowly accumulate in the oceans. As the\r\nprocess went on, all parts of the ocean's surface would become warmer,\r\nfor equatorial latitudes would be less and less cooled by cold water\r\nfrom below, while the water blown from low latitudes to high would be\r\ncorrespondingly warmer. The warming of the ocean would come to an end\r\nonly with the attainment of a state of equilibrium in which the loss of\r\nheat by radiation and evaporation from the ocean's surface equaled the\r\nloss which under other circumstances would arise from the rise of warm\r\nair in cyclonic storms. When once the oceans were warmed, they would\r\nform an extremely strong conservative force tending to preserve an\r\nequable climate in all latitudes and at all seasons. According to the\r\nsolar cyclonic hypothesis such conditions ought to have prevailed\r\nthroughout most of geological time. Only after a strong and prolonged\r\nsolar disturbance with its consequent storminess would conditions like\r\nthose of today be expected.\r\n\r\nIn this connection another possibility may be mentioned. It is commonly\r\nassumed that the earth's axis is held steadily in one direction by the\r\nfact that the rotating earth is a great gyroscope. Having been tilted to\r\na certain position, perhaps by some extraneous force, the axis is\r\nsupposed to maintain that position until some other force intervenes.\r\nCordeiro,[67] however, maintains that this is true only of an absolutely\r\nrigid gyroscope. He believes that it is mathematically demonstrable that\r\nif an elastic gyroscope be gradually tilted by some extraneous force,\r\nand if that force then ceases to act, the gyroscope as a whole will\r\noscillate back and forth. The earth appears to be slightly elastic.\r\nCordeiro therefore applies his formulae to it, on the following\r\nassumptions: (1) That the original position of the axis was nearly\r\nvertical to the plane of the ecliptic in which the earth revolves around\r\nthe sun; (2) that at certain times the inclination has been even greater\r\nthan now; and (3) that the position of the axis with reference to the\r\nearth has not changed to any great extent, that is, the earth's poles\r\nhave remained essentially stationary with reference to the earth,\r\nalthough the whole earth has been gyroscopically tilted back and forth\r\nrepeatedly.\r\n\r\nWith a vertical axis the daylight and darkness in all parts of the earth\r\nwould be of equal duration, being always twelve hours. There would be no\r\nseasons, and the climate would approach the average condition now\r\nexperienced at the two equinoxes. On the whole the climate of high\r\nlatitudes would give the impression of being milder than now, for there\r\nwould be less opportunity for the accumulation of snow and ice with\r\ntheir strong cooling effect. On the other hand, if the axis were tilted\r\nmore than now, the winter nights would be longer and the winters more\r\nsevere than at present, and there would be a tendency toward glaciation.\r\nThus Cordeiro accounts for alternating mild and glacial epochs. The\r\nentire swing from the vertical position to the maximum inclination and\r\nback to the vertical may last millions of years depending on the earth's\r\ndegree of elasticity. The swing beyond the vertical position in the\r\nother direction would be equally prolonged. Since the axis is now\r\nsupposed to be much nearer its maximum than its minimum degree of\r\ntilting, the duration of epochs having a climate more severe than that\r\nof the present would be relatively short, while the mild epochs would be\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nCordeiro's hypothesis has been almost completely ignored. One reason is\r\nthat his treatment of geological facts, and especially his method of\r\nriding rough-shod over widely accepted conclusions, has not commended\r\nhis work to geologists. Therefore they have not deemed it worth while to\r\nurge mathematicians to test the assumptions and methods by which he\r\nreached his results. It is perhaps unfair to test Cordeiro by geology,\r\nfor he lays no claim to being a geologist. In mathematics he labors\r\nunder the disadvantage of having worked outside the usual professional\r\nchannels, so that his work does not seem to have been subjected to\r\nsufficiently critical analysis.\r\n\r\nWithout expressing any opinion as to the value of Cordeiro's results we\r\nfeel that the subject of the earth's gyroscopic motion and of a possible\r\nsecular change in the direction of the axis deserves investigation for\r\ntwo chief reasons. In the first place, evidences of seasonal changes and\r\nof seasonal uniformity seem to occur more or less alternately in the\r\ngeological record. Second, the remarkable discoveries of Garner and\r\nAllard[68] show that the duration of daylight has a pronounced effect\r\nupon the reproduction of plants. We have referred repeatedly to the tree\r\nferns, corals, and other forms of life which now live in relatively low\r\nlatitudes and which cannot endure strong seasonal contrasts, but which\r\nonce lived far to the north. On the other hand, Sayles,[69] for example,\r\nfinds that microscopical examination of the banding of ancient shales\r\nand slates indicates distinct seasonal banding like that of recent\r\nPleistocene clays or of the Squantum slate formed during or near the\r\nPermian glacial period. Such seasonal banding is found in rocks of\r\nvarious ages: (a) Huronian, in cobalt shales previously reported by\r\nColeman; (b) late Proterozoic or early Cambrian in Hiwassee slate; (c)\r\nlower Cambrian, in Georgian slates of Vermont; (d) lower Ordovician, in\r\nGeorgia (Rockmart slate), Tennessee (Athens shale), Vermont (slates),\r\nand Quebec (Beekmantown formation); and (e) Permian in Massachusetts\r\n(Squantum slate). How far the periods during which such evidence of\r\nseasons was recorded really alternated with mild periods, when tropical\r\nspecies lived in high latitudes and the contrast of seasons was almost\r\nor wholly lacking, we have as yet no means of knowing. If periods\r\ncharacterized by marked seasonal changes should be found to have\r\nalternated with those when the seasons were of little importance, the\r\nfact would be of great geological significance.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Garner and Allard as to the effect of light on\r\nreproduction began with a peculiar tobacco plant which appeared in some\r\nexperiments at Washington. The plant grew to unusual size, and seemed to\r\npromise a valuable new variety. It formed no seeds, however, before the\r\napproach of cold weather. It was therefore removed to a greenhouse where\r\nit flowered and produced seed. In succeeding years the flowering was\r\nlikewise delayed till early winter, but finally it was discovered that\r\nif small plants were started in the greenhouse in the early fall they\r\nflowered at the same time as the large ones. Experiments soon\r\ndemonstrated that the time of flowering depends largely upon the length\r\nof the daily period when the plants are exposed to light. The same is\r\ntrue of many other plants, and there is great variety in the conditions\r\nwhich lead to flowering. Some plants, such as witch hazel, appear to be\r\nstimulated to bloom by very short days, while others, such as evening\r\nprimrose, appear to require relatively long days. So sensitive are\r\nplants in this respect that Garner and Allard, by changing the length of\r\nthe period of light, have caused a flowerbud in its early stages not\r\nonly to stop developing but to return once more to a vegetative shoot.\r\n\r\n    Common iris, which flowers in May and June, will not blossom under\r\n    ordinary conditions when grown in the greenhouse in winter, even\r\n    under the same temperature conditions that prevail in early summer.\r\n    Again, one variety of soy beans will regularly begin to flower in\r\n    June of each year, a second variety in July, and a third in August,\r\n    when all are planted on the same date. There are no temperature\r\n    differences during the summer months which could explain these\r\n    differences in time of flowering; and, since \"internal causes\" alone\r\n    cannot be accepted as furnishing a satisfactory explanation, some\r\n    external factor other than temperature must be responsible.\r\n\r\n    The ordinary varieties of cosmos regularly flower in the fall in\r\n    northern latitudes if they are planted in the spring or summer. If\r\n    grown in a warm greenhouse during the winter months the plants also\r\n    flower readily, so that the cooler weather of fall is not a\r\n    necessary condition. If successive plantings of cosmos are made in\r\n    the greenhouse during the late winter and early spring months,\r\n    maintaining a uniform temperature throughout, the plantings made\r\n    after a certain date will fail to blossom promptly, but, on the\r\n    contrary, will continue to grow till the following fall, thus\r\n    flowering at the usual season for this species. This curious\r\n    reversal of behavior with advance of the season cannot be attributed\r\n    to change in temperature. Some other factor is responsible for the\r\n    failure of cosmos to blossom during the summer months. In this\r\n    respect the behavior of cosmos is just the opposite of that observed\r\n    in iris.\r\n\r\n    Certain varieties of soy beans change their behavior in a peculiar\r\n    manner with advance of the summer season. The variety known as\r\n    Biloxi, for example, when planted early in the spring in the\r\n    latitude of Washington, D. C., continues to grow throughout the\r\n    summer, flowering in September. The plants maintain growth without\r\n    flowering for fifteen to eighteen weeks, attaining a height of five\r\n    feet or more. As the dates of successive plantings are moved forward\r\n    through the months of June and July, however there is a marked\r\n    tendency for the plants to cut short the period of growth which\r\n    precedes flowering. This means, of course, that there is a tendency\r\n    to flower at approximately the same time of year regardless of the\r\n    date of planting. As a necessary consequence, the size of the plants\r\n    at the time of flowering is reduced in proportion to the delay in\r\n    planting.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of this on geological problems lies in a query which it\r\nraises as to the ability of a genus or family of plants to adapt itself\r\nto days of very different length from those to which it is wonted. Could\r\ntree ferns, ginkgos, cycads, and other plants whose usual range of\r\nlocation never subjects them to daylight for more than perhaps fourteen\r\nhours or less than ten, thrive and reproduce themselves if subjected to\r\nperiods of daylight ranging all the way from nothing up to about\r\ntwenty-four hours? No answer to this is yet possible, but the question\r\nraises most interesting opportunities of investigation. If Cordeiro is\r\nright as to the earth's elastic gyroscopic motion, there may have been\r\ncertain periods when a vertical or almost vertical axis permitted the\r\ndays to be of almost equal length at all seasons in all latitudes. If\r\nsuch an absence of seasons occurred when the lands were low, when the\r\noceans were extensive and widely open toward the poles, and when storms\r\nwere relatively inactive, the result might be great mildness of climate\r\nsuch as appears sometimes to have prevailed in the middle of geological\r\neras. Suppose on the other hand that the axis should be tilted more than\r\nnow, and that the lands should be widely emergent and the storm belt\r\nhighly active in low latitudes, perhaps because of the activity of the\r\nsun. The conditions might be favorable for glaciation at latitudes as\r\nlow as those where the Permo-Carboniferous ice sheets appear to have\r\ncentered. The possibilities thus suggested by Cordeiro's hypothesis are\r\nso interesting that the gyroscopic motion of the earth ought to be\r\ninvestigated more thoroughly. Even if no such gyroscopic motion takes\r\nplace, however, the other causes of mild climate discussed in this\r\nchapter may be enough to explain all the observed phenomena.\r\n\r\nMany important biological consequences might be drawn from this study of\r\nmild geological climates, but this book is not the place for them. In\r\nthe first chapter we saw that one of the most remarkable features of the\r\nclimate of the earth is its wonderful uniformity through hundreds of\r\nmillions of years. As we come down through the vista of years the mild\r\ngeological periods appear to represent a return as nearly as possible to\r\nthis standard condition of uniformity. Certain changes of the earth\r\nitself, as we shall see in the next chapter, may in the long run tend\r\nslightly to change the exact conditions of this climatic standard, as we\r\nmight perhaps call it. Yet they act so slowly that their effect during\r\nhundreds of millions of years is still open to question. At most they\r\nseem merely to have produced a slight increase in diversity from season\r\nto season and from zone to zone. The normal climate appears still to be\r\nof a milder type than that which happens to prevail at present. Some\r\nsolar condition, whose possible nature will be discussed later, seems\r\neven now to cause the number of cyclonic storms to be greater than\r\nnormal. Hence the earth's climate still shows something of the great\r\ndiversity of seasons and of zones which is so marked a characteristic of\r\nglacial epochs.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Rollin T.

This chapter and the\r\nnext consider two other sorts of climatic changes, the slight secular\r\nprogression during the hundreds of millions of years of recorded earth\r\nhistory, and especially the long slow geologic oscillations of millions\r\nor tens of millions of years. It is generally agreed among geologists\r\nthat the progressive change has tended toward greater extremes of\r\nclimate; that is, greater seasonal contrasts, and greater contrasts from\r\nplace to place and from zone to zone.[70] The slow cyclic changes have\r\nbeen those that favored widespread glaciation at one extreme near the\r\nends of geologic periods and eras, and mild temperatures even in\r\nsubpolar regions at the other extreme during the medial portions of the\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nAs has been pointed out in an earlier chapter, it has often been assumed\r\nthat all climatic changes are due to terrestrial causes. We have seen,\r\nhowever, that there is strong evidence that solar variations play a\r\nlarge part in modifying the earth's climate. We have also seen that no\r\nknown terrestrial agency appears to be able to produce the abrupt\r\nchanges noted in recent years, the longer cycles of historical times, or\r\ngeological changes of the shorter type, such as glaciation.\r\nNevertheless, terrestrial changes doubtless have assisted in producing\r\nboth the progressive change and the slow cyclic changes recorded in the\r\nrocks, and it is the purpose of this chapter and the two that follow to\r\nconsider what terrestrial changes have taken place and the probable\r\neffect of such changes.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial changes that have a climatic significance are numerous.\r\nSome, such as variations in the amount of volcanic dust in the higher\r\nair, have been considered in an earlier chapter. Others are too\r\nimperfectly known to warrant discussion, and in addition there are\r\npresumably others which are entirely unknown. Doubtless some of these\r\nlittle known or unknown changes have been of importance in modifying\r\nclimate. For example, the climatic influence of vegetation, animals, and\r\nman may be appreciable. Here, however, we shall confine ourselves to\r\npurely physical causes, which will be treated in the following order:\r\nFirst, those concerned with the solid parts of the earth, namely: (I)\r\namount of land; (II) distribution of land; (III) height of land; (IV)\r\nlava flows; and (V) internal heat. Second, those which arise from the\r\nsalinity of oceans, and third, those depending on the composition and\r\namount of atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial change which appears indirectly to have caused the\r\ngreatest change in climate is the contraction of the earth. The problem\r\nof contraction is highly complex and is as yet only imperfectly\r\nunderstood. Since only its results and not its processes influence\r\nclimate, the following section as far as page 196 is not necessary to\r\nthe general reader. It is inserted in order to explain why we assume\r\nthat there have been oscillations between certain types of distribution\r\nof the lands.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the earth's contraction may be judged from the shrinkage\r\nindicated by the shortening of the rock formations in folded mountains\r\nsuch as the Alps, Juras, Appalachians, and Caucasus. Geologists are\r\ncontinually discovering new evidence of thrust faults of great magnitude\r\nwhere masses of rock are thrust bodily over other rocks, sometimes for\r\nmany miles. Therefore, the estimates of the amount of shrinkage based on\r\nthe measurements of folds and faults need constant revision upward.\r\nNevertheless, they have already reached a considerable figure. For\r\nexample, in 1919, Professor A. Heim estimated the shortening of the\r\nmeridian passing through the modern Alps and the ancient Hercynian and\r\nCaledonian mountains as fully a thousand miles in Europe, and over five\r\nhundred miles for the rest of this meridian.[71] This is a radial\r\nshortening of about 250 miles. Possibly the shrinkage has been even\r\ngreater than this. Chamberlin[72] has compared the density of the earth,\r\nmoon, Mars, and Venus with one another, and found it probable that the\r\nradial shrinkage of the earth may be as much as 570 miles. This result\r\nis not so different from Heim's as appears at first sight, for Heim made\r\nno allowance for unrecognized thrust faults and for the contraction\r\nincident to metamorphism. Moreover, Heim did not include shrinkage\r\nduring the first half of geological time before the above-mentioned\r\nmountain systems were upheaved.\r\n\r\nAccording to a well-established law of physics, contraction of a\r\nrotating body results in more rapid rotation and greater centrifugal\r\nforce. These conditions must increase the earth's equatorial bulge and\r\nthereby cause changes in the distribution of land and water. Opposed to\r\nthe rearrangement of the land due to increased rotation caused by\r\ncontraction, there has presumably been another rearrangement due to\r\ntidal retardation of the earth's rotation and a consequent lessening of\r\nthe equatorial bulge. G. H. Darwin long ago deduced a relatively large\r\nretardation due to lunar tides. A few years ago W. D. MacMillan, on\r\nother assumptions, deduced only a negligible retardation. Still more\r\nrecently Taylor[73] has studied the tides of the Irish Sea, and his work\r\nhas led Jeffreys[74] and Brown[75] to conclude that there has been\r\nconsiderable retardation, perhaps enough, according to Brown, to equal\r\nthe acceleration due to the earth's contraction. From a prolonged and\r\nexhaustive study of the motions of the moon Brown concludes that tidal\r\nfriction or some other cause is now lengthening the day at the rate of\r\none second per thousand years, or an hour in almost four million years\r\nif the present rate continues. He makes it clear that the retardation\r\ndue to tides would not correspond in point of time with the acceleration\r\ndue to contraction. The retardation would occur slowly, and would take\r\nplace chiefly during the long quiet periods of geologic history, while\r\nthe acceleration would occur rapidly at times of diastrophic\r\ndeformation. As a consequence, the equatorial bulge would alternately be\r\nreduced at a slow rate, and then somewhat suddenly augmented.\r\n\r\nThe less rigid any part of the earth is, the more quickly it responds to\r\nthe forces which lead to bulging or which tend to lessen the bulge.\r\nSince water is more fluid than land, the contraction of the earth and\r\nthe tidal retardation presumably tend alternately to increase and\r\ndecrease the amount of water near the equator more than the amount of\r\nland. Thus, throughout geological history we should look for cyclic\r\nchanges in the relative area of the lands within the tropics and similar\r\nchanges of opposite phase in higher latitudes. The extent of the change\r\nwould depend upon (a) the amount of alteration in the speed of rotation,\r\nand (b) the extent of low land in low latitudes and of shallow sea in\r\nhigh latitudes. According to Slichter's tables, if the earth should\r\nrotate in twenty-three hours instead of twenty-four, the great Amazon\r\nlowland would be submerged by the inflow of oceanic water, while wide\r\nareas in Hudson Bay, the North Sea, and other northern regions, would\r\nbecome land because the ocean water would flow away from them.[76]\r\n\r\nFollowing the prompt equatorward movement of water which would occur as\r\nthe speed of rotation increased, there must also be a gradual movement\r\nor creepage of the solid rocks toward the equator, that is, a bulging of\r\nthe ocean floor and of the lands in low latitudes, with a consequent\r\nemergence of the lands there and a relative rise of sea level in higher\r\nlatitudes. Tidal retardation would have a similar effect. Suess[77] has\r\ndescribed widespread elevated strand lines in the tropics which he\r\ninterprets as indicating a relatively sudden change in sea level, though\r\nhe does not suggest a cause of the change. However, in speaking of\r\nrecent geological times, Suess reports that a movement more recent than\r\nthe old strands \"was an accumulation of water toward the equator, a\r\ndiminution toward the poles, and (it appears) as though this last\r\nmovement were only one of the many oscillations which succeed each other\r\nwith the same tendency, i.e., with a positive excess at the equator, a\r\nnegative excess at the poles.\" (Vol. II, p. 551.) This creepage of the\r\nrocks equatorward seemingly might favor the growth of mountains in\r\ntropical and subtropical regions, because it is highly improbable that\r\nthe increase in the bulge would go on in all longitudes with perfect\r\nuniformity. Where it went on most rapidly mountains would arise. That\r\nsuch irregularity of movement has actually occurred is suggested not\r\nonly by the fact that many Cenozoic and older mountain ranges extend\r\neast and west, but by the further fact that these include some of our\r\ngreatest ranges, many of which are in fairly low latitudes. The\r\nHimalayas, the Javanese ranges, and the half-submerged Caribbean chains\r\nare examples. Such mountains suggest a thrust in a north and south\r\ndirection which is just what would happen if the solid mass of the earth\r\nwere creeping first equatorward and then poleward.\r\n\r\nA fact which is in accord with the idea of a periodic increase in the\r\noceans in low latitudes because of renewed bulging at the equator is the\r\nexposure in moderately high latitudes of the greatest extent of ancient\r\nrocks. This seems to mean that in low latitudes the frequent deepening\r\nof the oceans has caused the old rocks to be largely covered by\r\nsediments, while the old lands in higher latitudes have been left more\r\nfully exposed to erosion.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion of such periodic equatorward movements of the ocean\r\nwater is found in the reported contrast between the relative stability\r\nwith which the northern part of North America has remained slightly\r\nabove sea level except at times of widespread submergence, while the\r\nsouthern parts have suffered repeated submergence alternating with great\r\nemergence.[78] Furthermore, although the northern part of North America\r\nhas been generally exposed to erosion since the Proterozoic, it has\r\nsupplied much less sediment than have the more southern land areas.[79]\r\nThis apparently means that much of Canada has stood relatively low,\r\nwhile repeated and profound uplift alternating with depression has\r\noccurred in subtropical latitudes, apparently in adjustment to changes\r\nin the earth's speed of rotation. The uplifts generally followed the\r\ntimes of submergence due to equatorward movement of the water, though\r\nthe buckling of the crust which accompanies shrinkage doubtless caused\r\nsome of the submergence. The evidence that northern North America stood\r\nrelatively low throughout much of geological time depends not only on\r\nthe fact that little sediment came to the south from the north, but also\r\non the fact that at times of especially widespread epicontinental seas,\r\nthe submergence was initiated at the north.[80] This is especially true\r\nfor Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, and Jurassic times in North America.\r\nGeneral submergence of this kind is supposed to be due chiefly to the\r\noverflowing of the ocean when its level is slowly raised by the\r\ndeposition of sediment derived from the erosion of what once were\r\ncontinental highlands but later are peneplains. The fact that such\r\nsubmergence began in high latitudes, however, seems to need a further\r\nexplanation. The bulging of the rock sphere at the equator and the\r\nconsequent displacement of some of the water in low latitudes would\r\nfurnish such an explanation, as would also a decrease in the speed of\r\nrotation induced by tidal retardation, if that retardation were great\r\nenough and rapid enough to be geologically effective.\r\n\r\nThe climatic effects of the earth's contraction, which we shall shortly\r\ndiscuss, are greatly complicated by the fact that contraction has taken\r\nplace irregularly. Such irregularity has occurred in spite of the fact\r\nthat the processes which cause contraction have probably gone on quite\r\nsteadily throughout geological history. These processes include the\r\nchemical reorganization of the minerals of the crust, a process which is\r\nillustrated by the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks into crystalline\r\nforms. The escape of gases through volcanic action or otherwise has been\r\nanother important process.\r\n\r\nAlthough the processes which cause contraction probably go on steadily,\r\ntheir effect, as Chamberlin[81] and others have pointed out, is probably\r\ndelayed by inertia. Thus the settling of the crust or its movement on a\r\nlarge scale is delayed. Perhaps the delay continues until the stresses\r\nbecome so great that of themselves they overcome the inertia, or\r\npossibly some outside agency, whose nature we shall consider later,\r\nreenforces the stresses and gives the slight impulse which is enough to\r\nrelease them and allow the earth's crust to settle into a new state of\r\nequilibrium. When contraction proceeds actively, the ocean segments,\r\nbeing largest and heaviest, are likely to settle most, resulting in a\r\ndeepening of the oceans and an emergence of the lands. Following each\r\nconsiderable contraction there would be an increase in the speed of\r\nrotation. The repeated contractions with consequent growth of the\r\nequatorial bulge would alternate with long quiet periods during which\r\ntidal retardation would again decrease the speed of rotation and hence\r\nlessen the bulge. The result would be repeated changes of distribution\r\nof land and water, with consequent changes in climate.\r\n\r\nI. We shall now consider the climatic effect of the repeated changes in\r\nthe relative amounts of land and water which appear to have resulted\r\nfrom the earth's contraction and from changes in its speed of rotation.\r\nDuring many geologic epochs a larger portion of the earth was covered\r\nwith water than at present. For example, during at least twelve out of\r\nabout twenty epochs, North America has suffered extensive\r\ninundations,[82] and in general the extensive submergence of Europe, the\r\nother area well known geologically, has coincided with that of North\r\nAmerica. At other times, the ocean has been less extensive than now, as\r\nfor example during the recent glacial period, and probably during\r\nseveral of the glacial periods of earlier date. Each of the numerous\r\nchanges in the relative extent of the lands must have resulted in a\r\nmodification of climate.[83] This modification would occur chiefly\r\nbecause water becomes warm far more slowly than land, and cools off far\r\nmore slowly.\r\n\r\nAn increase in the lands would cause changes in several climatic\r\nconditions. (a) The range of temperature between day and night and\r\nbetween summer and winter would increase, for lands become warmer by day\r\nand in summer than do oceans, and cooler at night and in winter. The\r\nhigher summer temperature when the lands are widespread is due chiefly\r\nto the fact that the land, if not snow-covered, absorbs more of the\r\nsun's radiant energy than does the ocean, for its reflecting power is\r\nlow. The lower winter temperature when lands are widespread occurs not\r\nonly because they cool off rapidly but because the reduced oceans cannot\r\ngive them so much heat. Moreover, the larger the land, the more\r\ngenerally do the winds blow outward from it in winter and thus prevent\r\nthe ocean heat from being carried inland. So long as the ocean is not\r\nfrozen in high latitudes, it is generally the chief source of heat in\r\nwinter, for the nights are several months long near the poles, and even\r\nwhen the sun does shine its angle is so low that reflection from the\r\nsnow is very great. Furthermore, although on the average there is more\r\nreflection from water than from land, the opposite is true in high\r\nlatitudes in winter when the land is snow-covered while the ocean is\r\nrelatively dark and is roughened by the waves. Another factor in causing\r\nlarge lands to have extremely low temperature in winter is the fact that\r\nin proportion to their size they are less protected by fog and cloud\r\nthan are smaller areas. The belt of cloud and fog which is usually\r\nformed when the wind blows from the ocean to the relatively cold land is\r\nrestricted to the coastal zone. Thus the larger the land, the smaller\r\nthe fraction in which loss of heat by radiation is reduced by clouds and\r\nfogs. Hence an increase in the land area is accompanied by an increase\r\nin the contrasts in temperature between land and water.\r\n\r\n(b) The contrasts in temperature thus produced must cause similar\r\ncontrasts in atmospheric pressure, and hence stronger barometric\r\ngradients. (c) The strong gradients would mean strong winds, flowing\r\nfrom land to sea or from sea to land. (d) Local convection would also be\r\nstrengthened in harmony with the expansion of the lands, for the more\r\nrapid heating of land than of water favors active convection.\r\n\r\n(e) As the extent of the ocean diminished, there would normally be a\r\ndecrease in the amount of water vapor for three reasons: (1) Evaporation\r\nfrom the ocean is the great source of water vapor. Other conditions\r\nbeing equal, the smaller the ocean becomes, the less the evaporation.\r\n(2) The amount of water vapor in the air diminishes as convection\r\nincreases, since upward convection is a chief method by which\r\ncondensation and precipitation are produced, and water vapor removed\r\nfrom the atmosphere. (3) Nocturnal cooling sufficient to produce dew and\r\nfrost is very much more common upon land than upon the ocean. The\r\nformation of dew and frost diminishes the amount of water vapor at least\r\ntemporarily. (f) Any diminution in water vapor produced in these ways,\r\nor otherwise, is significant because water vapor is the most essential\r\npart of the atmosphere so far as regulation of temperature is concerned.\r\nIt tends to keep the days from becoming hot or the nights cold.\r\nTherefore any decrease in water vapor would increase the diurnal and\r\nseasonal range of temperature, making the climate more extreme and\r\nsevere. Thus a periodic increase in the area of the continents would\r\nclearly make for periodic increased climatic contrasts, with great\r\nextremes, a type of climatic change which has recurred again and again.\r\nIndeed, each great glaciation accompanied or followed extensive\r\nemergence of the lands.[84]\r\n\r\nWhether or not there has been a _progressive_ increase from era to era\r\nin the area of the lands is uncertain. Good authorities disagree widely.\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that at present the lands are more extensive\r\nthan at most times in the past, though smaller, perhaps, than at certain\r\nperiods. The wide expanse of lands helps explain the prominence of\r\nseasons at present as compared with the past.\r\n\r\nII. The contraction of the earth, as we have seen, has produced great\r\nchanges in the distribution as well as in the extent of land and water.\r\nLarge parts of the present continents have been covered repeatedly by\r\nthe sea, and extensive areas now covered with water have been land. In\r\nrecent geological times, that is, during the Pliocene and Pleistocene,\r\nmuch of the present continental shelf, the zone less than 600 feet below\r\nsea level, was land. If the whole shelf had been exposed, the lands\r\nwould have been greater than at present by an area larger than North\r\nAmerica. When the lands were most elevated, or a little earlier, North\r\nAmerica was probably connected with Asia and almost with Europe. Asia in\r\nturn was apparently connected with the larger East Indian islands. In\r\nmuch earlier times land occupied regions where now the ocean is fairly\r\ndeep. Groups of islands, such as the East Indies and Malaysia and\r\nperhaps the West Indies, were united into widespreading land masses.\r\nFigs. 7 and 9, illustrating the paleography of the Permian and the\r\nCretaceous periods, respectively, indicate a land distribution radically\r\ndifferent from that of today.\r\n\r\nSo far as appears from the scattered facts of geological history, the\r\nchanges in the distribution of land seem to have been marked by the\r\nfollowing characteristics: (1) Accompanying the differentiation of\r\ncontinental and oceanic segments of the earth's crust, the oceans have\r\nbecome somewhat deeper, and their basins perhaps larger, while the\r\ncontinents, on the average, have been more elevated and less subject to\r\nsubmergence. Hence there have been less radical departures from the\r\npresent distribution during the relatively recent Cenozoic era than in\r\nthe ancient Paleozoic because the submergence of continental areas has\r\nbecome less general and less frequent. For example, the last extensive\r\nepeiric or interior sea in North America was in the Cretaceous, at least\r\nten million years ago, and according to Barrell perhaps fifty million,\r\nwhile in Europe, according to de Lapparent,[85] a smaller share of the\r\npresent continent has been submerged since the Cretaceous than before.\r\nIndeed, as in North America, the submergence has decreased on the\r\naverage since the Paleozoic era. (2) The changes in distribution of land\r\nwhich have taken place during earth history have been cyclic.\r\nRepeatedly, at the close of each of the score or so of geologic periods,\r\nthe continents emerged more or less, while at the close of the groups of\r\nperiods known as eras, the lands were especially large and emergent.\r\nAfter each emergence, a gradual encroachment of the sea took place, and\r\ntoward the close of several of the earlier periods, the sea appears to\r\nhave covered a large fraction of the present land areas. (3) On the\r\nwhole, the amount of land in the middle and high latitudes of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere appears to have increased during geologic time. Such\r\nan increase does not require a growth of the continents, however, in the\r\nbroader sense of the term, but merely that a smaller fraction of the\r\ncontinent and its shelf should be submerged. (4) In tropical latitudes,\r\non the other hand, the extent of the lands seems to have decreased,\r\napparently by the growth of the ocean basins. South America and Africa\r\nare thought by many students to have been connected, and Africa was\r\nunited with India via Madagascar, as is suggested in Fig. 9. The most\r\nradical cyclic as well as the most radical progressive changes in land\r\ndistribution also seem to have taken place in tropical regions.[86]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 9. Cretaceous Paleogeography._\r\n(_After Schuchert._)]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is much evidence of periodic increase of the sea in\r\nequatorial latitudes and of land in high latitudes, it has remained for\r\nthe zooelogist Metcalf to present a very pretty bit of evidence that at\r\ncertain times submergence along the equator coincided with emergence in\r\nhigh latitudes, and vice versa. Certain fresh water frogs which carry\r\nthe same internal parasite are confined to two widely separated areas in\r\ntropical and south temperate America and in Australia. The extreme\r\nimprobability that both the frogs and the parasites could have\r\noriginated independently in two unconnected areas and could have\r\ndeveloped by convergent evolution so that they are almost identical in\r\nthe two continents makes it almost certain that there must have been a\r\nland connection between South America and Australia, presumably by way\r\nof Antarctica. The facts as to the parasites seem also to prove that\r\nwhile the land connection existed there was a sea across South America\r\nin equatorial latitudes. The parasite infests not only the frogs but the\r\nAmerican toads known as Bufo. Now Bufo originated north of the equator\r\nin America and differs from the frogs which originated in southern South\r\nAmerica in not being found in Australia. This raises the question of how\r\nthe frogs could go to Australia via Antarctica carrying the parasite\r\nwith them, while the toads could not go. Metcalf's answer is that the\r\ntoads were cut off from the southern part of South America by an\r\nequatorial sea until after the Antarctic connection between the Old\r\nWorld and the New was severed.\r\n\r\n    As Patagonia let go of Antarctica by subsidence of the intervening\r\n    land area, there was a probable concomitant rise of land through\r\n    what is now middle South America and the northern and southern\r\n    portions of this continent came together.[87]\r\n\r\nThese various changes in the earth's crust have given rise to certain\r\nspecific types of distribution of the lands, which will now be\r\nconsidered. We shall inquire what climatic conditions would arise from\r\nchanges in (a) the continuity of the lands from north to south, (b) the\r\namount of land in tropical latitudes, and (c) the amount of land in\r\nmiddle and high latitudes.\r\n\r\n(a) At present the westward drift of warm waters, set in motion by the\r\ntrade winds, is interrupted by land masses and turned poleward,\r\nproducing the important Gulf Stream Drift and Japan Current in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and corresponding, though less important, currents\r\nin the southern hemisphere. During the past, quite different sets of\r\nocean currents doubtless have existed in response to a different\r\ndistribution of land. Repeatedly, in the mid-Cretaceous (Fig. 9) and\r\nseveral other periods, the present American barrier to the westward\r\nmoving tropical current was broken in Central America. Even if the\r\nsupposed continent of \"Gondwana Land\" extended from Africa to South\r\nAmerica in equatorial latitudes, strong currents must still have flowed\r\nwestward along its northern shore under the impulse of the peculiarly\r\nstrong trade winds which the equatorial land would create. Nevertheless\r\nat such times relatively little warm tropical water presumably entered\r\nthe North Atlantic, for it escaped into the Pacific. At several other\r\ntimes, such as the late Ordovician and mid-Devonian, when the isthmian\r\nbarrier existed, it probably turned an important current northward into\r\nwhat is now the Mississippi Basin instead of into the Atlantic. There it\r\ntraversed an epeiric, or mid-continental sea open to both north and\r\nsouth. Hence its effectiveness in warming Arctic regions must have been\r\nquite different from that of the present Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\n(b) We will next consider the influences of changes in the amount of\r\nequatorial and tropical land. As such lands are much hotter than the\r\ncorresponding seas, the intensity and width of the equatorial belt of\r\nlow pressure must be great when they are extensive. Hence the trade\r\nwinds must have been stronger than now whenever tropical lands were more\r\nextensive than at present. This is because the trades are produced by\r\nthe convection due to excessive heat along the heat equator. There the\r\nair expands upward and flows poleward at high altitudes. The trade wind\r\nconsists of air moving toward the heat equator to take the place of the\r\nair which there rises. When the lands in low latitudes were wide the\r\ntrade winds must also have dominated a wide belt. The greater width of\r\nthe trade-wind belt today over Africa than over the Atlantic illustrates\r\nthe matter. The belt must have been still wider when Gondwana Land was\r\nlarge, as it is believed to have been during the Paleozoic era and the\r\nearly Mesozoic.\r\n\r\nAn increase in the width of the equatorial belt of low pressure under\r\nthe influence of broad tropical lands would be accompanied not only by\r\nstronger and more widespread trade winds, but by a corresponding\r\nstrengthening of the subtropical belts of high pressure. The chief\r\nreason would be the greater expansion of the air in the equatorial low\r\npressure belt and the consequent more abundant outflow of air at high\r\naltitudes in the form of anti-trades or winds returning poleward above\r\nthe trades. Such winds would pile up the air in the region of the\r\nhigh-pressure belt. Moreover, since the meridians converge as one\r\nproceeds away from the equator, the air of the poleward-moving\r\nanti-trades tends to be crowded as it reaches higher latitudes, thus\r\nincreasing the pressure. Unless there were a corresponding increase in\r\ntropical cyclones, one of the most prominent results of the strengthened\r\ntrades and the intensified subtropical high-pressure belt at times of\r\nbroad lands in low latitudes would be great deserts. It will be recalled\r\nthat the trade-wind lowlands and the extra-tropical belt of highs are\r\nthe great desert belts at present. The trade-wind lowlands are desert\r\nbecause air moving into warmer latitudes takes up water except where it\r\nis cooled by rising on mountain-sides. The belt of highs is arid because\r\nthere, too, air is being warmed, but in this case by descending from\r\naloft.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the atmospheric pressure in the subtropical belt should be\r\nintensified, the winds flowing poleward from this belt would necessarily\r\nbecome stronger. These would begin as southwesterlies in the northern\r\nhemisphere and northwesterlies in the southern. In the preceding chapter\r\nwe have seen that such winds, especially when cyclonic storms are few\r\nand mild, are a powerful agent in transferring subtropical heat\r\npoleward. If the strength of the westerlies were increased because of\r\nbroad lands in low latitudes, their efficacy in transferring heat would\r\nbe correspondingly augmented. It is thus evident that any change in the\r\nextent of tropical lands during the geologic past must have had\r\nimportant climatic consequences in changing the velocity of the\r\natmospheric circulation and in altering the transfer of heat from low\r\nlatitudes to high. When the equatorial and tropical lands were broad the\r\nwinds and currents must have been strong, much heat must have been\r\ncarried away from low latitudes, and the contrast between low and high\r\nlatitudes must have been relatively slight. As we have already remarked,\r\nleading paleogeographers believe that changes in the extent of the lands\r\nhave been especially marked in low latitudes, and that on the average\r\nthere has been a decrease in the extent of land within the tropics.\r\nGondwana Land is the greatest illustration of this. In the same way, on\r\nthe numerous paleogeographic maps of North America, most\r\npaleogeographers have shown fairly extensive lands south of the latitude\r\nof the United States during most of the geologic epochs.[88]\r\n\r\n(c) There is evidence that during geologic history the area of the lands\r\nin middle and high latitudes, as well as in low latitudes, has changed\r\nradically. An increase in such lands would cause the winters to grow\r\ncolder. This would be partly because of the loss of heat by radiation\r\ninto the cold dry air over the continents in winter, and partly because\r\nof increased reflection from snow and frost, which gather much more\r\nwidely upon the land than upon the ocean. Furthermore, in winter when\r\nthe continents are relatively cold, there is a strong tendency for winds\r\nto blow out from the continent toward the ocean. The larger the land the\r\nstronger this tendency. In Asia it gives rise to strong winter monsoons.\r\nThe effect of such winds is illustrated by the way in which the\r\nwesterlies prevent the Gulf Stream from warming the eastern United\r\nStates in winter. The Gulf Stream warms northwestern Europe much more\r\nthan the United States because, in Europe, the prevailing winds are\r\nonshore.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of an increase in the area of the lands in middle and\r\nhigh latitudes would be to interpose barriers to oceanic circulation and\r\nthus lower the temperature of polar regions. This would not mean\r\nglaciation in high latitudes, however, even when the lands were\r\nwidespread as in the Mesozoic and early Tertiary. Students of glaciology\r\nare more and more thoroughly convinced that glaciation depends on the\r\navailability of moisture even more than upon low temperature.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be noted that each of the several climatic\r\ninfluences of increased land area in the high latitudes would tend to\r\nincrease the contrasts between land and sea, between winter and summer,\r\nand between low latitudes and high. In other words, so far as the effect\r\nupon high latitudes themselves is concerned, an expansion of the lands\r\nthere would tend in the same direction as a diminution in low latitudes.\r\nIn so far as the general trend of geological evolution has been toward\r\nmore land in high latitudes and less in low, it would help to produce a\r\nprogressive increase in climatic diversity such as is faintly indicated\r\nin the rock strata. On the other hand, the oscillations in the\r\ndistribution of the lands, of which geology affords so much evidence,\r\nmust certainly have played an important part in producing the periodic\r\nchanges of climate which the earth has undergone.\r\n\r\nIII. Throughout geological history there is abundant evidence that the\r\nprocess of contraction has led to marked differences not only in the\r\ndistribution and area of the lands, but in their height. On the whole\r\nthe lands have presumably increased in height since the Proterozoic,\r\nsomewhat in proportion to the increased differentiation of continents\r\nand oceans.[89] If there has been such an increase, the contrast between\r\nthe climate of ocean and land must have been accentuated, for highlands\r\nhave a greater diurnal and seasonal range of temperature than do\r\nlowlands. The ocean has very little range of either sort. The large\r\nrange at high altitudes is due chiefly to the small quantity of water\r\nvapor, for this declines steadily with increased altitude. A diminution\r\nin the density of the other constituents of the air also decreases the\r\nblanketing effect of the atmosphere. In conformity with the great\r\nseasonal range in temperature at times when the lands stand high, the\r\ndirection of the wind would be altered. When the lands are notably\r\nwarmer than the oceans, the winds commonly flow from land to sea, and\r\nwhen the continents are much colder than the oceans, the direction is\r\nreversed. The monsoons of Asia are examples. Strong seasonal winds\r\ndisturb the normal planetary circulation of the trade winds in low\r\nlatitudes and of the westerlies in middle latitudes. They also interfere\r\nwith the ocean currents set in motion by the planetary winds. The net\r\nresult is to hinder the transfer of heat from low latitudes to high, and\r\nthus to increase the contrasts between the zones. Local as well as zonal\r\ncontrasts are also intensified. The higher the land, the greater,\r\nrelatively speaking, are the cloudiness and precipitation on seaward\r\nslopes, and the drier the interior. Indeed, most highlands are arid.\r\nHenry's[90] recent study of the vertical distribution of rainfall on\r\nmountain-sides indicates that a decrease sets in at about 3500 feet in\r\nthe tropics and only a little higher in mid-latitudes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the main effects upon atmospheric circulation and\r\nprecipitation, each of the many upheavals of the lands must have been\r\naccompanied by many minor conditions which tended toward diversity. For\r\nexample, the streams were rejuvenated, and instead of meandering perhaps\r\nover vast flood plains they intrenched their channels and in many cases\r\ndug deep gorges. The water table was lowered, soil was removed from\r\nconsiderable areas, the bare rock was exposed, and the type of dominant\r\nvegetation altered in many places. An almost barren ridge may represent\r\nall that remains of what was once a vast forested flood plain. Thus,\r\nincreased elevation of the land produces contrasted conditions of slope,\r\nvegetation, availability of ground water, exposure to wind and so forth,\r\nand these unite in diversifying climate. Where mountains are formed,\r\nstrong contrasts are sure to occur. The windward slopes may be very\r\nrainy, while neighboring leeward slopes are parched by a dry foehn wind.\r\nAt the same time the tops may be snow-covered. Increased local contrasts\r\nin climatic conditions are known to influence the intensity of cyclonic\r\nstorms,[91] and these affect the climatic conditions of all middle and\r\nhigh latitudes, if not of the entire earth. The paths followed by\r\ncyclonic storms are also altered by increased contrast between land and\r\nwater. When the continents are notably colder than the neighboring\r\noceans, high atmospheric pressure develops on the lands and interferes\r\nwith the passage of lows, which are therefore either deflected around\r\nthe continent or forced to move slowly.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of lofty mountains has an even more striking climatic\r\neffect than the general uplift of a region. In Proterozoic times there\r\nwas a great range in the Lake Superior region; in the late Devonian the\r\nAcadian mountains of New England and the Maritime Provinces of Canada\r\npossibly attained a height equal to the present Rockies. Subsequently,\r\nin the late Paleozoic a significant range stood where the Ouachitas now\r\nare. Accompanying the uplift of each of these ranges, and all others,\r\nthe climate of the surrounding area, especially to leeward, must have\r\nbeen altered greatly. Many extensive salt deposits found now in fairly\r\nhumid regions, for example, the Pennsylvanian and Permian deposits of\r\nKansas and Oklahoma, were probably laid down in times of local aridity\r\ndue to the cutting off of moisture-bearing winds by the mountains of\r\nLlanoria in Louisiana and Texas. Hence such deposits do not necessarily\r\nindicate periods of widespread and profound aridity.\r\n\r\nWhen the causes of ancient glaciation were first considered by\r\ngeologists, about the middle of the nineteenth century, it was usually\r\nassumed that the glaciated areas had been elevated to great heights, and\r\nthus rendered cold enough to permit the accumulation of glaciers. The\r\nmany glaciers occurring in the Alps of central Europe where glaciology\r\narose doubtless suggested this explanation. However, it is now known\r\nthat most of the ancient glaciation was not of the alpine type, and\r\nthere is adequate proof that the glacial periods cannot be explained as\r\ndue directly and solely to uplift. Nevertheless, upheavals of the lands\r\nare among the most important factors in controlling climate, and\r\nvariations in the height of the lands have doubtless assisted in\r\nproducing climate oscillations, especially those of long duration.\r\nMoreover, the progressive increase in the height of the lands has\r\npresumably played a part in fostering local and zonal diversity in\r\ncontrast with the relative uniformity of earlier geological times.\r\n\r\nIV. The contraction of the earth has been accompanied by volcanic\r\nactivity as well as by changes in the extent, distribution, and altitude\r\nof the lands. The probable part played by volcanic dust as a\r\ncontributory factor in producing short sudden climatic variations has\r\nalready been discussed. There is, however, another though probably less\r\nimportant respect in which volcanic activity may have had at least a\r\nslight climatic significance. The oldest known rocks, those of the\r\nArchean era, contain so much igneous matter that many students have\r\nassumed that they show that the entire earth was once liquid. It is now\r\nconsidered that they merely indicate igneous activity of great\r\nmagnitude. In the later part of Proterozoic time, during the second\r\nquarter of the earth's history according to Schuchert's estimate, there\r\nwere again vast outflowings of lava. In the Lake Superior district, for\r\nexample, a thickness of more than a mile accumulated over a large area,\r\nand lavas are common in many areas where rocks of this age are known.\r\nThe next quarter of the earth's history elapsed without any\r\ncorrespondingly great outflows so far as is known, though several lesser\r\nones occurred. Toward the end of the last quarter, and hence quite\r\nrecently from the geological standpoint, another period of outflows,\r\nperhaps as noteworthy as that of the Proterozoic, occurred in the\r\nCretaceous and Tertiary.\r\n\r\nThe climatic effects of such extensive lava flows would be essentially\r\nas follows: In the first place so long as the lavas were hot they would\r\nset up a local system of convection with inflowing winds. This would\r\ninterfere at least a little with the general winds of the area. Again,\r\nwhere the lava flowed out into water, or where rain fell upon hot lava,\r\nthere would be rapid evaporation which would increase the rainfall. Then\r\nafter the lava had cooled, it would still influence climate a trifle in\r\nso far as its color was notably darker or lighter than that of the\r\naverage surface. Dark surfaces absorb solar heat and become relatively\r\nwarm when the sun shines upon them. Dark objects likewise radiate heat\r\nmore rapidly than light-colored objects. Hence they cool more rapidly at\r\nnight, and in the winter. As most lavas are relatively dark they\r\nincrease the average diurnal range of temperature. Hence even after they\r\nare cool they increase the climatic diversity of the land.\r\n\r\nThe amount of heat given to the atmosphere by an extensive lava flow,\r\nthough large according to human standards, is small compared with the\r\namount received from the sun by a like area, except during the first few\r\nweeks or months before the lava has formed a thick crust. Furthermore,\r\nprobably only a small fraction of any large series of flows occurred in\r\na given century or millennium. Moreover, even the largest lava flows\r\ncovered an area of only a few hundredths of one per cent of the earth's\r\nsurface. Nevertheless, the conditions which modify climate are so\r\ncomplicated that it would be rash to state that this amount of\r\nadditional heat has been of no climatic significance. Like the\r\nproverbial \"straw that broke the camel's back,\" the changes it would\r\nsurely produce in local convection, atmospheric pressure, and the\r\ndirection of the wind may have helped to shift the paths of storms and\r\nto produce other complications which were of appreciable climatic\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nV. The last point which we shall consider in connection with the effect\r\nof the earth's interior upon climate is internal heat. The heat given\r\noff by lavas is merely a small part of that which is emitted by the\r\nearth as a whole. In the earliest part of geological history enough heat\r\nmay have escaped from the interior of the earth to exert a profound\r\ninfluence on the climate. Knowlton,[92] as we have seen, has recently\r\nbuilt up an elaborate theory on this assumption. At present, however,\r\naccurate measurements show that the escape of heat is so slight that it\r\nhas no appreciable influence except in a few volcanic areas. It is\r\nestimated to raise the average temperature of the earth's surface less\r\nthan 0.1 deg.C.[93]\r\n\r\nIn order to contribute enough heat to raise the surface temperature\r\n1 deg.C., the temperature gradient from the interior of the earth to the\r\nsurface would need to be ten times as great as now, for the rate of\r\nconduction varies directly with the gradient. If the gradient were ten\r\ntimes as great as now, the rocks at a depth of two and one-half miles\r\nwould be so hot as to be almost liquid according to Barrell's[94]\r\nestimates. The thick strata of unmetamorphosed Paleozoic rocks indicate\r\nthat such high temperatures have not prevailed at such slight depths\r\nsince the Proterozoic. Furthermore, the fact that the climate was cold\r\nenough to permit glaciation early in the Proterozoic era and at from one\r\nto three other times before the opening of the Paleozoic suggests that\r\nthe rate of escape of heat was not rapid even in the first half of the\r\nearth's recorded history. Yet even if the general escape of heat has\r\nnever been large since the beginning of the better-known part of\r\ngeological history, it was presumably greater in early times than at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIf there actually has been an appreciable decrease in the amount of heat\r\ngiven out by the earth's interior, its effects would agree with the\r\nobserved conditions of the geological record. It would help to explain\r\nthe relative mildness of zonal, seasonal, and local contrasts of climate\r\nin early geological times, but it would not help to explain the long\r\noscillations from era to era which appear to have been of much greater\r\nimportance. Those oscillations, so far as we can yet judge, may have\r\nbeen due in part to solar changes, but in large measure they seem to be\r\nexplained by variations in the extent, distribution, and altitude of the\r\nlands. Such variations appear to be the inevitable result of the earth's\r\ncontraction.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Chas.

E. P. Brooks[95] to\r\ninterpret post-glacial climatic changes almost entirely in terms of\r\ncrustal movement. We believe that he carries the matter much too far,\r\nbut his discussion is worthy of rather full recapitulation, not only\r\nfor its theoretical value but because it gives a good summary of\r\npost-glacial changes. His climatic table for northwest Europe as\r\nreprinted from the annual report of the Smithsonian Institution for\r\n1917, p. 366, is as follows:\r\n\r\n      _Phase_                      _Climate_                _Date_\r\n\r\n  1.

Becoming drier.       300 A. D.-\r\n\r\nBrooks bases his chronology largely on De Geer's measurements of the\r\nannual layers of clay in lake bottoms but makes much use of other\r\nevidence. According to Brooks the last glacial epoch lasted roughly from\r\n30,000 to 18,000 B. C., but this includes a slight amelioration of\r\nclimate followed by a readvance of the ice, known as the Buhl stage.\r\nDuring the time of maximum glaciation the British Isles stood twenty or\r\nthirty feet higher than now and Scandinavia was \"considerably\" more\r\nelevated. The author believes that this caused a fall of 1 deg.C. in the\r\ntemperature of the British Isles and of 2 deg.C. in Scandinavia. By an\r\ningenious though not wholly convincing method of calculation he\r\nconcludes that this lowering of temperature, aided by an increase in the\r\narea of the lands, sufficed to start an ice sheet in Scandinavia. The\r\nrelatively small area of ice cooled the air and gave rise to an area of\r\nhigh barometric pressure. This in turn is supposed to have caused\r\nfurther expansion of the ice and to have led to full-fledged glaciation.\r\n\r\nAbout 18,000 B. C. the retreat of the ice began in good earnest. Even\r\nthough no evidence has yet been found, Brooks believes there must have\r\nbeen a change in the distribution of land and sea to account for the\r\ndiminution of the ice. The ensuing millenniums formed the Magdalenian\r\nperiod in human history, the last stage of the Paleolithic, when man\r\nlived in caves and reindeer were abundant in central Europe.[96] At\r\nfirst the ice retreated very slowly and there were periods when for\r\nscores of years the ice edge remained stationary or even readvanced.\r\nAbout 10,000 B. C. the edge of the ice lay along the southern coast of\r\nSweden. During the next 2000 years it withdrew more rapidly to about\r\n59 deg.N. Then came the Fennoscandian pause, or Gschnitz stage, when for\r\nabout 200 years the ice edge remained in one position, forming a great\r\nmoraine. Brooks suggests that this pause about 8000 B. C. was due to the\r\nclosing of the connection between the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea\r\nand the synchronous opening of a connection between the Baltic and the\r\nWhite Seas, whereby cold Arctic waters replaced the warmer Atlantic\r\nwaters. He notes, however, that about 7500 B. C. the obliquity of the\r\necliptic was probably nearly 1 deg. greater than at present. This he\r\ncalculates to have caused the climate of Germany and Sweden to be 1 deg.F.\r\ncolder than at present in winter and 1 deg.F. warmer in summer.\r\n\r\nThe next climatic stage was marked by a rise of temperature till about\r\n6000 B. C. During this period the ice at first retreated, presumably\r\nbecause the climate was ameliorating, although no cause of such\r\namelioration is assigned. At length the ice lay far enough north to\r\nallow a connection between the Baltic and the Atlantic by way of Lakes\r\nWener and Wetter in southern Sweden. This is supposed to have warmed the\r\nBaltic Sea and to have caused the climate to become distinctly milder.\r\nNext the land rose once more so that the Baltic was separated from the\r\nAtlantic and was converted into the Ancylus lake of fresh water. The\r\nsouthwest Baltic region then stood 400 feet higher than now. The result\r\nwas the Daun stage, about 5000 B. C., when the ice halted or perhaps\r\nreadvanced a little, its front being then near Ragunda in about latitude\r\n63 deg.. Why such an elevation did not cause renewed glaciation instead of\r\nmerely the slight Daun pause, Brooks does not explain, although his\r\ncalculations as to the effect of a slight elevation of the land during\r\nthe main period of glaciation from 30,000 to 18,000 B. C. would seem to\r\ndemand a marked readvance.\r\n\r\nAfter 5000 B. C. there ensued a period when the climate, although still\r\ndistinctly continental, was relatively mild. The winters, to be sure,\r\nwere still cold but the summers were increasingly warm. In Sweden, for\r\nexample, the types of vegetation indicate that the summer temperature\r\nwas 7 deg.F. higher than now. Storms, Brooks assumes, were comparatively\r\nrare except on the outer fringe of Great Britain. There they were\r\nsufficiently abundant so that in the Northwest they gave rise to the\r\nfirst Peat-Bog period, during which swamps replaced forests of birch and\r\npine. Southern and eastern England, however, probably had a dry\r\ncontinental climate. Even in northwest Norway storms were rare as is\r\nindicated by remains of forests on islands now barren because of the\r\nstrong winds and fierce storms. Farther east most parts of central and\r\nnorthern Europe were relatively dry. This was the early Neolithic period\r\nwhen man advanced from the use of unpolished to polished stone\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nNot far from 4000 B. C. the period of continental climate was replaced\r\nby a comparatively moist maritime climate. Brooks believes that this was\r\nbecause submergence opened the mouth of the Baltic and caused the fresh\r\nAncylus lake to give place to the so-called Litorina sea. The\r\ntemperature in Sweden averaged about 3 deg.F. higher than at present and in\r\nsouthwestern Norway 2 deg.. More important than this was the small annual\r\nrange of temperature due to the fact that the summers were cool while\r\nthe winters were mild. Because of the presence of a large expanse of\r\nwater in the Baltic region, storms, as our author states, then crossed\r\nGreat Britain and followed the Baltic depression, carrying the moisture\r\nfar inland. In spite of the additional moisture thus available the snow\r\nline in southern Norway was higher than now.\r\n\r\nAt this point Brooks turns to other parts of the world. He states that\r\nnot far from 4000 B. C., a submergence of the lands, rarely amounting to\r\nmore than twenty-five feet, took place not only in the Baltic region but\r\nin Ireland, Iceland, Spitzbergen, and other parts of the Arctic Ocean,\r\nas well as in the White Sea, Greenland, and the eastern part of North\r\nAmerica. Evidences of a mild climate are found in all those places.\r\nSimilar evidence of a mild warm climate is found in East Africa, East\r\nAustralia, Tierra del Fuego, and Antarctica. The dates are not\r\nestablished with certainty but they at least fall in the period\r\nimmediately preceding the present epoch. In explanation of these\r\nconditions Brooks assumes a universal change of sea level. He suggests\r\nwith some hesitation that this may have been due to one of Pettersson's\r\nperiods of maximum \"tide-generating force.\" According to Pettersson the\r\nvarying positions of the moon, earth, and sun cause the tides to vary in\r\ncycles of about 9, 90, and 1800 years, though the length of the periods\r\nis not constant. When tides are high there is great movement of ocean\r\nwaters and hence a great mixture of the water at different latitudes.\r\nThis is supposed to cause an amelioration of climate. The periods of\r\nmaximum and minimum tide-generating force are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Maxima 3500 B. C.--------2100 B. C.--------350 B. C.-------A. D. 1434\r\n  Minima ---------2800 B. C.--------1200 B. C.-------A. D. 530---------\r\n\r\nBrooks thinks that the big trees in California and the Norse sagas and\r\nGermanic myths indicate a rough agreement of climatic phenomena with\r\nPettersson's last three dates, while the mild climate of 4000 B. C. may\r\nreally belong to 3500 B. C. He gives no evidence confirming Pettersson's\r\nview at the other three dates.\r\n\r\nTo return to Brooks' sketch of the relation of climatic pulsations to\r\nthe altitude of the lands, by 3000 B. C., that is, toward the close of\r\nthe Neolithic period, further elevation is supposed to have taken place\r\nover the central latitudes of western Europe. Southern Britain, which\r\nhad remained constantly above its present level ever since 30,000 B. C.,\r\nwas perhaps ninety feet higher than now. Ireland was somewhat enlarged\r\nby elevation, the Straits of Dover were almost closed, and parts of the\r\npresent North Sea were land. To these conditions Brooks ascribes the\r\nprevalence of a dry continental climate. The storms shifted northward\r\nonce more, the winds were mild, as seems to be proved by remains of\r\ntrees in exposed places; and forests replaced fields of peat and heath\r\nin Britain and Germany. The summers were perhaps warmer than now but the\r\nwinters were severe. The relatively dry climate prevailed as far west as\r\nIreland. For example, in Drumkelin Bog in Donegal County a corded oak\r\nroad and a two-story log cabin appear to belong to this time. Fourteen\r\nfeet of bog lie below the floor and twenty-six above. This period,\r\nperhaps 3000-2000 B. C., was the legendary heroic age of Ireland when\r\n\"the vigour of the Irish reached a level not since attained.\" This, as\r\nBrooks points out, may have been a result of the relatively dry climate,\r\nfor today the extreme moisture of Ireland seems to be a distinct\r\nhandicap. In Scandinavia, civilization, or at least the stage of\r\nrelative progress, was also high at this time.\r\n\r\nBy 1600 B. C. the land had assumed nearly its present level in the\r\nBritish Isles and the southern Baltic region, while northern Scandinavia\r\nstill stood lower than now. The climate of Britain and Germany was so\r\nhumid that there was an extensive formation of peat even on high ground\r\nnot before covered. This moist stage seems to have lasted almost to the\r\ntime of Christ, and may have been the reason why the Romans described\r\nBritain as peculiarly wet and damp. At this point Brooks again departs\r\nfrom northwest Europe to a wider field:\r\n\r\n    It is possible that we have to attribute this damp period in\r\n    Northwest Europe to some more general cause, for Ellsworth\r\n    Huntington's curves of tree-growth in California and climate in\r\n    Western Asia both show moister conditions from about 1000 B. C. to\r\n    A. D. 200, and the same author believes that the Mediterranean lands\r\n    had a heavier rainfall about 500 B. C. to A. D. 200. It seems that\r\n    the phase was marked by a general increase of the storminess of the\r\n    temperate regions of the northern hemisphere at least, with a\r\n    maximum between Ireland and North Germany, indicating probably that\r\n    the Baltic again became the favourite track of depressions from the\r\n    Atlantic.\r\n\r\nBrooks ends his paper with a brief resume of glacial changes in North\r\nAmerica, but as the means of dating events are unreliable the degree of\r\nsynchronism with Europe is not clear. He sums up his conclusions as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    On the whole it appears that though there is a general similarity in\r\n    the climatic history of the two sides of the North Atlantic, the\r\n    changes are not really contemporaneous, and such relationship as\r\n    appears is due mainly to the natural similarity in the geographical\r\n    history of two regions both recovering from an Ice Age, and only\r\n    very partially to world-wide pulsations of climate. Additional\r\n    evidence on this head will be available when Baron de Geer publishes\r\n    the results of his recent investigations of the seasonal glacial\r\n    clays of North America, especially if, as he hopes, he is able to\r\n    correlate the banding of these clays with the growth-rings of the\r\n    big trees.\r\n\r\n    When we turn to the northwest of North America, this is brought out\r\n    very markedly. For in Yukon and Alaska the Ice Age was a very mild\r\n    affair compared with its severity in eastern America and\r\n    Scandinavia. As the land had not a heavy ice-load to recover from,\r\n    there were no complicated geographical changes. Also, there were no\r\n    fluctuations of climate, but simply a gradual passage to present\r\n    conditions. The latter circumstance especially seems to show that\r\n    the emphasis laid on geographical rather than astronomical factors\r\n    of _great_ climatic changes is not misplaced.\r\n\r\nBrooks' painstaking discussion of post-glacial climatic changes is of\r\ngreat value because of the large body of material which he has so\r\ncarefully wrought together. His strong belief in the importance of\r\nchanges in the level of the lands deserves serious consideration. It is\r\ndifficult, however, to accept his final conclusion that such changes are\r\nthe main factors in recent climatic changes. It is almost impossible,\r\nfor example, to believe that movements of the land could produce almost\r\nthe same series of climatic changes in Europe, Central Asia, the western\r\nand eastern parts of North America, and the southern hemisphere. Yet\r\nsuch changes appear to have occurred during and since the glacial\r\nperiod. Again there is no evidence whatever that movements of the land\r\nhave anything to do with the historic cycles of climate or with the\r\ncycles of weather in our own day, which seem to be the same as glacial\r\ncycles on a small scale. Also, as Dr. Simpson points out in discussing\r\nBrooks' paper, there appears \"no solution along these lines of the\r\nproblem connected with rich vegetation in both polar circles and the\r\nice-age which produced the ice-sheet at sea-level in Northern India.\"\r\nNevertheless, we may well believe that Brooks is right in holding that\r\nchanges in the relative level and relative area of land and sea have had\r\nimportant local effects. While they are only one of the factors involved\r\nin climatic changes, they are certainly one that must constantly be kept\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: C. E. P.

Variations in the composition of sea water\r\nand of air and in the amount of air must almost certainly have occurred,\r\nand must have produced at least slight climatic consequences. It should\r\nbe pointed out at once that such variations appear to be far less\r\nimportant climatically than do movements of the earth's crust and\r\nchanges in the activity of the sun. Moreover, in most cases, they are\r\nnot reversible as are the crustal and solar phenomena. Hence, while most\r\nof them appear to have been unimportant so far as climatic oscillations\r\nand fluctuations are concerned, they seemingly have aided in producing\r\nthe slight secular progression to which we have so often referred.\r\n\r\nThere is general agreement among geologists that the ocean has become\r\nincreasingly saline throughout the ages. Indeed, calculations of the\r\nrate of accumulation of salt have been a favorite method of arriving at\r\nestimates of the age of the ocean, and hence of the earliest marine\r\nsediments. So far as known, however, no geologist or climatologist has\r\ndiscussed the probable climatic effects of increased salinity. Yet it\r\nseems clear that an increase in salinity must have a slight effect upon\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nSalinity affects climate in four ways: (1) It appreciably influences the\r\nrate of evaporation; (2) it alters the freezing point; (3) it produces\r\ncertain indirect effects through changes in the absorption of carbon\r\ndioxide; and (4) it has an effect on oceanic circulation.\r\n\r\n(1) According to the experiments of Mazelle and Okada, as reported by\r\nKruemmel,[97] evaporation from ordinary sea water is from 9 to 30 per\r\ncent less rapid than from fresh water under similar conditions. The\r\nvariation from 9 to 30 per cent found in the experiments depends,\r\nperhaps, upon the wind velocity. When salt water is stagnant, rapid\r\nevaporation tends to result in the development of a film of salt on the\r\ntop of the water, especially where it is sheltered from the wind. Such a\r\nfilm necessarily reduces evaporation. Hence the relatively low salinity\r\nof the oceans in the past probably had a tendency to increase the amount\r\nof water vapor in the air. Even a little water vapor augments slightly\r\nthe blanketing effect of the air and to that extent diminishes the\r\ndiurnal and seasonal range of temperature and the contrast from zone to\r\nzone.\r\n\r\n(2) Increased salinity means a lower freezing temperature of the oceans\r\nand hence would have an effect during cold periods such as the present\r\nand the Pleistocene ice age. It would not, however, be of importance\r\nduring the long warm periods which form most of geologic time. A\r\nsalinity of about 3.5 per cent at present lowers the freezing point of\r\nthe ocean roughly 2 deg.C. below that of fresh water. If the ocean were\r\nfresh and our winters as cold as now, all the harbors of New England and\r\nthe Middle Atlantic States would be icebound. The Baltic Sea would also\r\nbe frozen each winter, and even the eastern harbors of the British Isles\r\nwould be frequently locked in ice. At high latitudes the area of\r\npermanently frozen oceans would be much enlarged. The effect of such a\r\ncondition upon marine life in high latitudes would be like that of a\r\nchange to a warmer climate. It would protect the life on the continental\r\nshelf from the severe battering of winter storms. It would also lessen\r\nthe severity of the winter temperature in the water for when water\r\nfreezes it gives up much latent heat,--eighty calories per cubic\r\ncentimeter. Part of this raises the temperature of the underlying water.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the ice near northern shores would influence the life\r\nof the lands quite differently from that of the oceans. It would act\r\nlike an addition of land to the continents and would, therefore,\r\nincrease the atmospheric contrasts from zone to zone and from\r\ncontinental interior to ocean. In summer the ice upon the sea would tend\r\nto keep the coastal lands cool, very much as happens now near the Arctic\r\nOcean, where the ice floes have a great effect through their reflection\r\nof light and their absorption of heat in melting. In winter the virtual\r\nenlargement of the continents by the addition of an ice fringe would\r\ndecrease the snowfall upon the lands. Still more important would be the\r\neffect in intensifying the anti-cyclonic conditions which normally\r\nprevail in winter not only over continents but over ice-covered oceans.\r\nHence the outblowing cold winds would he strengthened.[98] The net\r\neffect of all these conditions would apparently be a diminution of\r\nsnowfall in high latitudes upon the lands even though the summer\r\nsnowfall upon the ocean and the coasts may have increased. This\r\ncondition may have been one reason why widespread glaciation does not\r\nappear to have prevailed in high latitudes during the Proterozoic and\r\nPermian glaciations, even though it occurred farther south. If the ocean\r\nduring those early glacial epochs were ice-covered down to middle\r\nlatitudes, a lack of extensive glaciation in high latitudes would be no\r\nmore surprising than is the lack of Pleistocene glaciation in the\r\nnorthern parts of Alaska and Asia. Great ice sheets are impossible\r\nwithout a large supply of moisture.\r\n\r\n(3) Among the indirect effects of salinity one of the chief appears to\r\nbe that the low salinity of the water in the past and the greater ease\r\nwith which it froze presumably allowed the temperature of the entire\r\nocean to be slightly higher than now. This is because ice serves as a\r\nblanket and hinders the radiation of heat from the underlying water. The\r\ntemperature of the ocean has a climatic significance not only directly,\r\nbut indirectly through its influence on the amount of carbon dioxide\r\nheld by the oceans. A change of even 1 deg.C. from the present mean\r\ntemperature of 2 deg.C. would alter the ability of the entire ocean to\r\nabsorb carbon dioxide by about 4 per cent. This, according to F. W.\r\nClarke,[99] is because the oceans contain from eighteen to twenty-seven\r\ntimes as much carbon dioxide as the air when only the free carbon\r\ndioxide is considered, and about seventy times as much according to\r\nJohnson and Williamson[100] when the partially combined carbon dioxide\r\nis also considered. Moreover, the capacity of water for carbon dioxide\r\nvaries sharply with the temperature.[101] Hence a rise in temperature of\r\nonly 1 deg.C. would theoretically cause the oceans to give up from 30 to 280\r\ntimes as much carbon dioxide as the air now holds. This, however, is on\r\nthe unfounded assumption that the oceans are completely saturated. The\r\nimportant point is merely that a slight change in ocean temperature\r\nwould cause a disproportionately large change in the amount of carbon\r\ndioxide in the air with all that this implies in respect to blanketing\r\nthe earth, and thus altering temperature.\r\n\r\n(4) Another and perhaps the most important effect of salinity upon\r\nclimate depends upon the rapidity of the deep-sea circulation. The\r\ncirculation is induced by differences of temperature, but its speed is\r\naffected at least slightly by salinity. The vertical circulation is now\r\ndominated by cold water from subpolar latitudes. Except in closed seas\r\nlike the Mediterranean the lower portions of the ocean are near the\r\nfreezing point. This is because cold water sinks in high latitudes by\r\nreason of its superior density, and then \"creeps\" to low latitudes.\r\nThere it finally rises and replaces either the water driven poleward by\r\nthe winds, or that which has evaporated from the Surface.[102]\r\n\r\nDuring past ages, when the sea water was less salty, the circulation was\r\npresumably more rapid than now. This was because, in tropical regions,\r\nthe rise of cold water is hindered by the sinking of warm surface water\r\nwhich is relatively dense because evaporation has removed part of the\r\nwater and caused an accumulation of salt. According to Kruemmel and\r\nMill,[103] the surface salinity of the subtropical belt of the North\r\nAtlantic commonly exceeds 3.7 per cent and sometimes reaches 3.77 per\r\ncent, whereas the underlying waters have a salinity of less than 3.5 per\r\ncent and locally as little as 3.44 per cent. The other oceans are\r\nslightly less saline than the North Atlantic at all depths, but the\r\nvertical salinity gradients along the tropics are similar. According to\r\nthe Smithsonian Physical Tables, the difference in salinity between the\r\nsurface water and that lying below is equivalent to a difference of .003\r\nin density, where the density of fresh water is taken as 1.000. Since\r\nthe decrease in density produced by warming water from the temperature\r\nof its greatest density (4 deg.C.) to the highest temperatures which ever\r\nprevail in the ocean (30 deg.C. or 86 deg.F.) is only .004, the more saline\r\nsurface waters of the dry tropics are at most times almost as dense as\r\nthe less saline but colder waters beneath the surface, which have come\r\nfrom higher latitudes. During days of especially great evaporation,\r\nhowever, the most saline portions of the surface waters in the dry\r\ntropics are denser than the underlying waters and therefore sink, and\r\nproduce a temporary local stagnation in the general circulation. Such a\r\nsinking of the warm surface waters is reported by Kruemmel, who detected\r\nit by means of the rise in temperature which it produces at considerable\r\ndepths. If such a hindrance to the circulation did not exist, the\r\nvelocity of the deep-sea movements would be greater.\r\n\r\nIf in earlier times a more rapid circulation occurred, low latitudes\r\nmust have been cooled more than now by the rise of cold waters. At the\r\nsame time higher latitudes were presumably warmed by a greater flow of\r\nwarm water from tropical regions because less of the surface heat sank\r\nin low latitudes. Such conditions would tend to lessen the climatic\r\ncontrast between the different latitudes. Hence, in so far as the rate\r\nof deep-sea circulation depends upon salinity, the slowly increasing\r\namount of salt in the oceans must have tended to increase the contrasts\r\nbetween low and high latitudes. Thus for several reasons, the increase\r\nof salinity during geologic history seems to deserve a place among the\r\nminor agencies which help to explain the apparent tendency toward a\r\nsecular progression of climate in the direction of greater contrasts\r\nbetween tropical and subpolar latitudes.\r\n\r\nChanges in the composition and amount of the atmosphere have presumably\r\nhad a climatic importance greater than that of changes in the salinity\r\nof the oceans. The atmospheric changes may have been either progressive\r\nor cyclic, or both. In early times, according to the nebular hypothesis,\r\nthe atmosphere was much more dense than now and contained a larger\r\npercentage of certain constituents, notably carbon dioxide and water.\r\nThe planetesimal hypothesis, on the other hand, postulates an increase\r\nin the density of the atmosphere, for according to this hypothesis the\r\ndensity of the atmosphere depends upon the power of the earth to hold\r\ngases, and this power increases as the earth grows bigger with the\r\ninfall of material from without.[104]\r\n\r\nWhichever hypothesis may be correct, it seems probable that when life\r\nfirst appeared on the land the atmosphere resembled that of today in\r\ncertain fundamental respects. It contained the elements essential to\r\nlife, and its blanketing effect was such as to maintain temperatures not\r\ngreatly different from those of the present. The evidence of this\r\ndepends largely upon the narrow limits of temperature within which the\r\nactivities of modern life are possible, and upon the cumulative evidence\r\nthat ancient life was essentially similar to the types now living. The\r\nresemblance between some of the oldest forms and those of today is\r\nstriking. For example, according to Professor Schuchert:[105] \"Many of\r\nthe living genera of forest trees had their origin in the Cretaceous,\r\nand the giant sequoias of California go back to the Triassic, while\r\nGinkgo is known in the Permian. Some of the fresh-water molluscs\r\ncertainly were living in the early periods of the Mesozoic, and the\r\nlung-fish of today (Ceratodus) is known as far back as the Triassic and\r\nis not very unlike other lung-fishes of the Devonian. The higher\r\nvertebrates and insects, on the other hand, are very sensitive to their\r\nenvironment, and therefore do not extend back generically beyond the\r\nCenozoic, and only in a few instances even as far as the Oligocene. Of\r\nmarine invertebrates the story is very different, for it is well known\r\nthat the horseshoe crab (Limulus) lived in the Upper Jurassic, and\r\nNautilus in the Triassic, with forms in the Devonian not far removed\r\nfrom this genus. Still longer-ranging genera occur among the\r\nbrachiopods, for living Lingula and Crania have specific representatives\r\nas far back as the early Ordovician. Among living foraminifers, Lagena,\r\nGlobigerina, and Nodosaria are known in the later Cambrian or early\r\nOrdovician. In the Middle Cambrian near Field, British Columbia, Walcott\r\nhas found a most varied array of invertebrates among which are\r\ncrustaceans not far removed from living forms. Zooelogists who see these\r\nwonderful fossils are at once struck with their modernity and the little\r\nchange that has taken place in certain stocks since that far remote\r\ntime. Back of the Paleozoic, little can be said of life from the generic\r\nstandpoint, since so few fossils have been recovered, but what is at\r\nhand suggests that the marine environment was similar to that of today.\"\r\n\r\nAt present, as we have repeatedly seen, little growth takes place either\r\namong animals or plants at temperatures below 0 deg.C. or above 40 deg.C., and\r\nfor most species the limiting temperatures are about 10 deg. and 30 deg.. The\r\nmaintenance of so narrow a scale of temperature is a function of the\r\natmosphere, as well as of the sun. Without an atmosphere, the\r\ntemperature by day would mount fatally wherever the sun rides high in\r\nthe sky. By night it would fall everywhere to a temperature approaching\r\nabsolute zero, that is -273 deg.C. Some such temperature prevails a few\r\nmiles above the earth's surface, beyond the effective atmosphere.\r\nIndeed, even if the atmosphere were almost as it is now, but only lacked\r\none of the minor constituents, a constituent which is often actually\r\nignored in statements of the composition of the air, life would be\r\nimpossible. Tyndall concludes that if water vapor were entirely removed\r\nfrom the atmosphere for a single day and night, all life--except that\r\nwhich is dormant in the form of seeds, eggs, or spores--would be\r\nexterminated. Part would be killed by the high temperature developed by\r\nday when the sun was high, and part, by the cold night.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of ancient glaciation as to the slight difference in the\r\nclimate and therefore in the atmosphere of early and late geological\r\ntimes is almost as clear as that of life. Just as life proves that the\r\nearth can never have been extremely cold during hundreds of millions of\r\nyears, so glaciation in moderately low latitudes near the dawn of earth\r\nhistory and at several later times, proves that the earth was not\r\nparticularly hot even in those early days. The gentle progressive change\r\nof climate which is recorded in the rocks appears to have been only in\r\nslight measure a change in the mean temperature of the earth as a whole,\r\nand almost entirely a change in the distribution of temperature from\r\nplace to place and season to season. Hence it seems probable that\r\nneither the earth's own emission of heat, nor the supply of solar heat,\r\nnor the power of the atmosphere to retain heat can have been much\r\ngreater a few hundred million years ago than now. It is indeed possible\r\nthat these three factors may have varied in such a way that any\r\nvariation in one has been offset by variations of the others in the\r\nopposite direction. This, however, is so highly improbable that it seems\r\nadvisable to assume that all three have remained relatively constant.\r\nThis conclusion together with a realization of the climatic significance\r\nof carbon dioxide has forced most of the adherents of the nebular\r\nhypothesis to abandon their assumption that carbon dioxide, the heaviest\r\ngas in the air, was very abundant until taken out by coal-forming plants\r\nor combined with the calcium oxide of igneous rocks to form the\r\nlimestone secreted by animals. In the same way the presence of sun\r\ncracks in sedimentary rocks of all ages suggests that the air cannot\r\nhave contained vast quantities of water vapor such as have been assumed\r\nby Knowlton and others in order to account for the former lack of sharp\r\nclimatic contrast between the zones. Such a large amount of water vapor\r\nwould almost certainly be accompanied by well-nigh universal and\r\ncontinual cloudiness so that there would be little chance for the pools\r\non the earth's water-soaked surface to dry up. Furthermore, there is\r\nonly one way in which such cloudiness could be maintained and that is by\r\nkeeping the air at an almost constant temperature night and day. This\r\nwould require that the chief source of warmth be the interior of the\r\nearth, a condition which the Proterozoic, Permian, and other widespread\r\nglaciations seem to disprove.\r\n\r\nThus there appears to be strong evidence against the radical changes in\r\nthe atmosphere which are sometimes postulated. Yet some changes must\r\nhave taken place, and even minor changes would be accompanied by some\r\nsort of climatic effect. The changes would take the form of either an\r\nincrease or a decrease in the atmosphere as a whole, or in its\r\nconstituent elements. The chief means by which the atmosphere has\r\nincreased appear to be as follows: (a) By contributions from the\r\ninterior of the earth via volcanoes and springs and by the weathering of\r\nigneous rocks with the consequent release of their enclosed gases;[106]\r\n(b) by the escape of some of the abundant gases which the ocean holds in\r\nsolution; (c) by the arrival on the earth of gases from space, either\r\nenclosed in meteors or as free-flying molecules; (d) by the release of\r\ngases from organic compounds by oxidation, or by exhalation from animals\r\nand plants. On the other hand, one or another of the constituents of the\r\natmosphere has presumably decreased (a) by being locked up in newly\r\nformed rocks or organic compounds; (b) by being dissolved in the ocean;\r\n(c) by the escape of molecules into space; and (d) by the condensation\r\nof water vapor.\r\n\r\nThe combined effect of the various means of increase and decrease\r\ndepends partly on the amount of each constituent received from the\r\nearth's interior or from space, and partly on the fact that the agencies\r\nwhich tend to deplete the atmosphere are highly selective in their\r\naction. Our knowledge of how large a quantity of new gases the air has\r\nreceived is very scanty, but judging by present conditions the general\r\ntendency is toward a slow increase chiefly because of meteorites,\r\nvolcanic action, and the work of deep-seated springs. As to decrease,\r\nthe case is clearer. This is because the chemically active gases,\r\noxygen, CO_{2}, and water vapor, tend to be locked up in the rocks,\r\nwhile the chemically inert gases, nitrogen and argon, show almost no\r\nsuch tendency. Though oxygen is by far the most abundant element in the\r\nearth's crust, making up more than 50 per cent of the total, it forms\r\nonly about one-fifth of the air. Nitrogen, on the other hand, is very\r\nrare in the rocks, but makes up nearly four-fifths of the air. It would,\r\ntherefore, seem probable that throughout the earth's history, there has\r\nbeen a progressive increase in the amount of atmospheric nitrogen, and\r\npresumably a somewhat corresponding increase in the mass of the air. On\r\nthe other hand, it is not clear what changes have occurred in the amount\r\nof atmospheric oxygen. It may have increased somewhat or perhaps even\r\nnotably. Nevertheless, because of the greater increase in nitrogen, it\r\nmay form no greater percentage of the air now than in the distant past.\r\n\r\nAs to the absolute amounts of oxygen, Barrell[107] thought that\r\natmospheric oxygen began to be present only after plants had appeared.\r\nIt will be recalled that plants absorb carbon dioxide and separate the\r\ncarbon from the oxygen, using the carbon in their tissues and setting\r\nfree the oxygen. As evidence of a paucity of oxygen in the air in early\r\nProterozoic times, Barrell cites the fact that the sedimentary rocks of\r\nthat remote time commonly are somewhat greyish or greenish-grey wackes,\r\nor other types, indicating incomplete oxidation. He admits, however,\r\nthat the stupendous thicknesses of red sandstones, quartzite, and\r\nhematitic iron ores of the later Proterozoic prove that by that date\r\nthere was an abundance of atmospheric oxygen. If so, the change from\r\npaucity to abundance must have occurred before fossils were numerous\r\nenough to give much clue to climate. However, Barrell's evidence as to\r\na former paucity of atmospheric oxygen is not altogether convincing. In\r\nthe first place, it does not seem justifiable to assume that there could\r\nbe no oxygen until plants appeared to break down the carbon dioxide, for\r\nsome oxygen is contributed by volcanoes,[108] and lightning decomposes\r\nwater into its elements. Part of the hydrogen thus set free escapes into\r\nspace, for the earth's gravitative force does not appear great enough to\r\nhold this lightest of gases, but the oxygen remains. Thus electrolysis\r\nof water results in the accumulation of oxygen. In the second place,\r\nthere is no proof that the ancient greywackes are not deoxidized\r\nsediments. Light colored rock formations do not necessarily indicate\r\na paucity of atmospheric oxygen, for such rocks are abundant\r\neven in recent times. For example, the Tertiary formations are\r\ncharacteristically light colored, a result, however, of deoxidation.\r\nFinally, the fact that sedimentary rocks, irrespective of their age,\r\ncontain an average of about 1.5 per cent more oxygen than do igneous\r\nrocks,[109] suggests that oxygen was present in the air in quantity even\r\nwhen the earliest shales and sandstones were formed, for atmospheric\r\noxygen seems to be the probable source of the extra oxygen they contain.\r\nThe formation of these particular sedimentary rocks by weathering of\r\nigneous rocks involves only a little carbon dioxide and water. Although\r\nit seems probable that oxygen was present in the atmosphere even at the\r\nbeginning of the geological record, it may have been far less abundant\r\nthen than now. It may have been removed from the atmosphere by animals\r\nor by the oxidation of the rocks almost as rapidly as it was added by\r\nvolcanoes, plants, and other agencies.\r\n\r\nAfter this chapter was in type, St. John[C] announced his interesting\r\ndiscovery that oxygen is apparently lacking in the atmosphere of Venus.\r\nHe considers that this proves that Venus has no life. Furthermore he\r\nconcludes that so active an element as oxygen cannot be abundant in the\r\natmosphere of a planet unless plants continually supply large quantities\r\nby breaking down carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nBut even if the earth has experienced a notable increase in atmospheric\r\noxygen since the appearance of life, this does not necessarily involve\r\nimportant climatic changes except those due to increased atmospheric\r\ndensity. This is because oxygen has very little effect upon the passage\r\nof light or heat, being transparent to all but a few wave lengths. Those\r\nabsorbed are chiefly in the ultra violet.\r\n\r\nThe distinct possibility that oxygen has increased in amount, makes it\r\nthe more likely that there has been an increase in the total atmosphere,\r\nfor the oxygen would supplement the increase in the relatively inert\r\nnitrogen and argon, which has presumably taken place. The climatic\r\neffects of an increase in the atmosphere include, in the first place, an\r\nincreased scattering of light as it approaches the earth. Nitrogen,\r\nargon, and oxygen all scatter the short waves of light and thus\r\ninterfere with their reaching the earth. Abbot and Fowle,[110] who have\r\ncarefully studied the matter, believe that at present the scattering is\r\nquantitatively important in lessening insolation. Hence our supposed\r\ngeneral increase in the volume of the air during part of geological\r\ntimes would tend to reduce the amount of solar energy reaching the\r\nearth's surface. On the other hand, nitrogen and argon do not appear to\r\nabsorb the long wave lengths known as heat, and oxygen absorbs so little\r\nas to be almost a non-absorber. Therefore the reduced penetration of the\r\nair by solar radiation due to the scattering of light would apparently\r\nnot be neutralized by any direct increase in the blanketing effect of\r\nthe atmosphere, and the temperature near the earth's surface would be\r\nslightly lowered by a thicker atmosphere. This would diminish the amount\r\nof water vapor which would be held in the air, and thereby lower the\r\ntemperature a trifle more.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the higher atmospheric pressure which would result\r\nfrom the addition of gases to the air would cause a lessening of the\r\nrate of evaporation, for that rate declines as pressure increases.\r\nDecreased evaporation would presumably still further diminish the vapor\r\ncontent of the atmosphere. This would mean a greater daily and seasonal\r\nrange of temperature, as is very obvious when we compare clear weather\r\nwith cloudy. Cloudy nights are relatively warm while clear nights are\r\ncool, because water vapor is an almost perfect absorber of radiant heat,\r\nand there is enough of it in the air on moist nights to interfere\r\ngreatly with the escape of the heat accumulated during the day.\r\nTherefore, if atmospheric moisture were formerly much more abundant than\r\nnow, the temperature must have been much more uniform. The tendency\r\ntoward climatic severity as time went on would be still further\r\nincreased by the cooling which would result from the increased wind\r\nvelocity discussed below; for cooling by convection increases with the\r\nvelocity of the wind, as does cooling by conduction.\r\n\r\nAny persistent lowering of the general temperature of the air would\r\naffect not only its ability to hold water vapor, but would produce a\r\nlessening in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide, for the colder\r\nthe ocean becomes the more carbon dioxide it can hold in solution. When\r\nthe oceanic temperature falls, part of the atmospheric carbon dioxide is\r\ndissolved in the ocean. This minor constituent of the air is important\r\nbecause although it forms only 0.003 per cent of the earth's atmosphere,\r\nAbbot and Fowle's[111] calculations indicate that it absorbs over 10 per\r\ncent of the heat radiated outward from the earth. Hence variations in\r\nthe amount of carbon dioxide may have caused an appreciable variation in\r\ntemperature and thus in other climatic conditions. Humphreys, as we have\r\nseen, has calculated that a doubling of the carbon dioxide in the air\r\nwould directly raise the earth's temperature to the extent of 1.3 deg.C.,\r\nand a halving would lower it a like amount. The indirect results of such\r\nan increase or decrease might be greater than the direct results, for\r\nthe change in temperature due to variations in carbon dioxide would\r\nalter the capacity of the air to hold moisture.\r\n\r\nTwo conditions would especially help in this respect; first, changes in\r\nnocturnal cooling, and second, changes in local convection. The presence\r\nof carbon dioxide diminishes nocturnal cooling because it absorbs the\r\nheat radiated by the earth, and re-radiates part of it back again. Hence\r\nwith increased carbon dioxide and with the consequent warmer nights\r\nthere would be less nocturnal condensation of water vapor to form dew\r\nand frost. Local convection is influenced by carbon dioxide because this\r\ngas lessens the temperature gradient. In general, the less the gradient,\r\nthat is, the less the contrast between the temperature at the surface\r\nand higher up, the less convection takes place. This is illustrated by\r\nthe seasonal variation in convection. In summer, when the gradient is\r\nsteepest, convection reaches its maximum. It will be recalled that when\r\nair rises it is cooled by expansion, and if it ascends far the moisture\r\nis soon condensed and precipitated. Indeed, local convection is\r\nconsidered by C. P. Day to be the chief agency which keeps the lower air\r\nfrom being continually saturated with moisture. The presence of carbon\r\ndioxide lessens convection because it increases the absorption of heat\r\nin the zone above the level in which water vapor is abundant, thus\r\nwarming these higher layers. The lower air may not be warmed\r\ncorrespondingly by an increase in carbon dioxide if Abbot and Fowle are\r\nright in stating that near the earth's surface there is enough water\r\nvapor to absorb practically all the wave lengths which carbon dioxide is\r\ncapable of absorbing. Hence carbon dioxide is chiefly effective at\r\nheights to which the low temperature prevents water vapor from\r\nascending. Carbon dioxide is also effective in cold winters and in high\r\nlatitudes when even the lower air is too cold to contain much water\r\nvapor. Moreover, carbon dioxide, by altering the amount of atmospheric\r\nwater vapor, exerts an indirect as well as a direct effect upon\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nOther effects of the increase in air pressure which we are here assuming\r\nduring at least the early part of geological times are corresponding\r\nchanges in barometric contrasts, in the strength of winds, and in the\r\nmass of air carried by the winds along the earth's surface. The increase\r\nin the mass of the air would reenforce the greater velocity of the winds\r\nin their action as eroding and transporting agencies. Because of the\r\ngreater weight of the air, the winds would be capable of picking up more\r\ndust and of carrying it farther and higher; while the increased\r\natmospheric friction would keep it aloft a longer time. The significance\r\nof dust at high levels and its relation to solar radiation have already\r\nbeen discussed in connection with volcanoes. It will be recalled that on\r\nthe average it lowers the surface temperature. At lower levels, since\r\ndust absorbs heat quickly and gives it out quickly, its presence raises\r\nthe temperature of the air by day and lowers it by night. Hence an\r\nincrease in dustiness tends toward greater extremes.\r\n\r\nFrom all these considerations it appears that if the atmosphere has\r\nactually evolved according to the supposition which is here tentatively\r\nentertained, the general tendency of the resultant climatic changes must\r\nhave been partly toward long geological oscillations and partly toward a\r\ngeneral though very slight increase in climatic severity and in the\r\ncontrasts between the zones. This seems to agree with the geological\r\nrecord, although the fact that we are living in an age of relative\r\nclimatic severity may lead us astray.\r\n\r\nThe significant fact about the whole matter is that the three great\r\ntypes of terrestrial agencies, namely, those of the earth's interior,\r\nthose of the oceans, and those of the air, all seem to have suffered\r\nchanges which lead to slow variations of climate. Many reversals have\r\ndoubtless taken place, and the geologic oscillations thus induced are\r\npresumably of much greater importance than the progressive change, yet\r\nso far as we can tell the purely terrestrial changes throughout the\r\nhundreds of millions of years of geological time have tended toward\r\ncomplexity and toward increased contrasts from continent to ocean, from\r\nlatitude to latitude, from season to season, and from day to night.\r\n\r\nThroughout geological history the slow and almost imperceptible\r\ndifferentiation of the earth's surface has been one of the most\r\nnoteworthy of all changes. It has been opposed by the extraordinary\r\nconservatism of the universe which causes the average temperature today\r\nto be so like that of hundreds of millions of years ago that many types\r\nof life are almost identical. Nevertheless, the differentiation has gone\r\non. Often, to be sure, it has presumably been completely masked by the\r\ndisturbances of the solar atmosphere which appear to have been the cause\r\nof the sharper, shorter climatic pulsations. But regardless of cosmic\r\nconservatism and of solar impulses toward change, the slow\r\ndifferentiation of the earth's surface has apparently given to the world\r\nof today much of the geographical complexity which is so stimulating a\r\nfactor in organic evolution. Such complexity--such diversity from place\r\nto place--appears to be largely accounted for by purely terrestrial\r\ncauses. It may be regarded as the great terrestrial contribution to the\r\nclimatic environment which guides the development of life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition: article \"Ocean.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: C.

We have inquired into the nature\r\nof the changes through which the earth's crust, the oceans, and the\r\natmosphere have influenced the climate of geological times. It has not\r\nbeen necessary, however, to study the origin of the earth, nor to trace\r\nits earlier stages. Our study of the geological record begins only when\r\nthe earth had attained practically its present mass, essentially its\r\npresent shape, and a climate so similar to that of today that life as we\r\nknow it was possible. In other words, the earth had passed the stages of\r\ninfancy, childhood, youth, and early maturity, and had reached full\r\nmaturity. As it still seems to be indefinitely far from old age, we\r\ninfer that during geological times its relative changes have been no\r\ngreater than those which a man experiences between the ages of perhaps\r\ntwenty-five and forty.\r\n\r\nSimilar reasoning applies with equal or greater force to the sun.\r\nBecause of its vast size it presumably passes through its stages of\r\ndevelopment much more slowly than the earth. In the first chapter of\r\nthis book we saw that the earth's relative uniformity of climate for\r\nhundreds of millions of years seems to imply a similar uniformity in\r\nsolar activity. This accords with a recent tendency among astronomers\r\nwho are more and more recognizing that the stars and the solar system\r\npossess an extraordinary degree of conservatism. Changes that once were\r\nsupposed to take place in thousands of years are now thought to have\r\nrequired millions. Hence in this chapter we shall assume that throughout\r\ngeological times the condition of the sun has been almost as at present.\r\nIt may have been somewhat larger, or different in other ways, but it was\r\nessentially a hot, gaseous body such as we see today and it gave out\r\nessentially the same amount of energy. This assumption will affect the\r\ngeneral validity of what follows only if it departs widely from the\r\ntruth. With this assumption, then, let us inquire into the degree to\r\nwhich the sun's atmosphere has probably been disturbed throughout\r\ngeological times.\r\n\r\nIn _Earth and Sun_, as already explained, a detailed study has led to\r\nthe conclusion that cyclonic storms are influenced by the electrical\r\naction of the sun. Such action appears to be most intense in sunspots,\r\nbut apparently pertains also to other disturbed areas in the sun's\r\natmosphere. A study of sunspots suggests that their true periodicity is\r\nalmost if not exactly identical with that of the orbital revolution of\r\nJupiter, 11.8 years. Other investigations show numerous remarkable\r\ncoincidences between sunspots and the orbital revolution of the other\r\nplanets, including especially Saturn and Mercury. This seems to indicate\r\nthat there is some truth in the hypothesis that sunspots and other\r\nrelated disturbances of the solar atmosphere owe their periodicity to\r\nthe varying effects of the planets as they approach and recede from the\r\nsun in their eccentric orbits and as they combine or oppose their\r\neffects according to their relative positions. This does not mean that\r\nthe energy of the solar disturbances is supposed to come from the\r\nplanets, but merely that their variations act like the turning of a\r\nswitch to determine when and how violently the internal forces of the\r\nsun shall throw the solar atmosphere into commotion. This hypothesis is\r\nby no means new, for in one form or another it has been advocated by\r\nWolfer, Birkeland, E. W. Brown, Schuster, Arctowski, and others.\r\n\r\nThe agency through which the planets influence the solar atmosphere is\r\nnot yet clear. The suggested agencies are the direct pull of\r\ngravitation, the tidal effect of the planets, and an electro-magnetic\r\neffect. In _Earth and Sun_ the conclusion is reached that the first two\r\nare out of the question, a conclusion in which E. W. Brown acquiesces.\r\nUnless some unknown cause is appealed to, this leaves an\r\nelectro-magnetic hypothesis as the only one which has a reasonable\r\nfoundation. Schuster inclines to this view. The conclusions set forth in\r\n_Earth and Sun_ as to the electrical nature of the sun's influence on\r\nthe earth point somewhat in the same direction. Hence in this chapter we\r\nshall inquire what would happen to the sun, and hence to the earth, on\r\ntheir journey through space, if the solar atmosphere is actually subject\r\nto disturbance by the electrical or other effects of other heavenly\r\nbodies. It need hardly be pointed out that we are here venturing into\r\nhighly speculative ground, and that the verity or falsity of the\r\nconclusions reached in this chapter has nothing to do with the validity\r\nof the reasoning in previous chapters. Those chapters are based on the\r\nassumption that terrestrial causes of climatic changes are supplemented\r\nby solar disturbances which produce their effect partly through\r\nvariations in temperature but also through variations in the intensity\r\nand paths of cyclonic storms. The present chapter seeks to shed some\r\nlight on the possible causes and sequence of solar disturbances.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by scanning the available evidence as to solar disturbances\r\nprevious to the time when accurate sunspot records are available. Two\r\nrather slender bits of evidence point to cycles of solar activity\r\nlasting hundreds of years. One of these has already been discussed in\r\nChapter VI, where the climatic stress of the fourteenth century was\r\ndescribed. At that time sunspots are known to have been unusually\r\nnumerous, and there were great climatic extremes. Lakes overflowed in\r\nCentral Asia; storms, droughts, floods, and cold winters were unusually\r\nsevere in Europe; the Caspian Sea rose with great rapidity; the trees of\r\nCalifornia grew with a vigor unknown for centuries; the most terrible of\r\nrecorded famines occurred in England and India; the Eskimos were\r\nprobably driven south by increasing snowiness in Greenland; and the\r\nMayas of Yucatan appear to have made their last weak attempt at a\r\nrevival of civilization under the stimulus of greater storminess and\r\nless constant rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe second bit of evidence is found in recent exhaustive studies of\r\nperiodicities by Turner[112] and other astronomers. They have sought\r\nevery possible natural occurrence for which a numerical record is\r\navailable for a long period. The most valuable records appear to be\r\nthose of tree growth, Nile floods, Chinese earthquakes, and sunspots.\r\nTurner reaches the conclusion that all four types of phenomena show the\r\nsame periodicity, namely, cycles with an average length of about 260 to\r\n280 years. He suggests that if this is true, the cycles in tree growth\r\nand in floods, both of which are climatic, are probably due to a\r\nnon-terrestrial cause. The fact that the sunspots show similar cycles\r\nsuggests that the sun's variations are the cause.\r\n\r\nThese two bits of evidence are far too slight to form the foundation of\r\nany theory as to changes in solar activity in the geological past.\r\nNevertheless it may be helpful to set forth certain possibilities as a\r\nstimulus to further research. For example, it has been suggested that\r\nmeteoric bodies may have fallen into the sun and caused it suddenly to\r\nflare up, as it were. This is not impossible, although it does not\r\nappear to have taken place since men became advanced enough to make\r\ncareful observations. Moreover, the meteorites which now fall on the\r\nearth are extremely small, the average size being computed as no larger\r\nthan a grain of wheat. The largest ever found on the earth's surface, at\r\nBacubirito in Mexico, weighs only about fifty tons, while within the\r\nrocks the evidences of meteorites are extremely scanty and\r\ninsignificant. If meteorites had fallen into the sun often enough and of\r\nsufficient size to cause glacial fluctuations and historic pulsations of\r\nclimate, it seems highly probable that the earth would show much more\r\nevidence of having been similarly disturbed. And even if the sun should\r\nbe bombarded by large meteors the result would probably not be sudden\r\ncold periods, which are the most notable phenomena of the earth's\r\nclimatic history, but sudden warm periods followed by slow cooling.\r\nNevertheless, the disturbance of the sun by collision with meteoric\r\nmatter can by no means be excluded as a possible cause of climatic\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nAllied to the preceding hypothesis is Shapley's[113] nebular hypothesis.\r\nAt frequent intervals, averaging about once a year during the last\r\nthirty years, astronomers have discovered what are known as novae. These\r\nare stars which were previously faint or even invisible, but which flash\r\nsuddenly into brilliancy. Often their light-giving power rises seven or\r\neight magnitudes--a thousand-fold. In addition to the spectacular novae\r\nthere are numerous irregular variables whose brilliancy changes in every\r\nratio from a few per cent up to several magnitudes. Most of them are\r\nlocated in the vicinity of nebulae, as is also the case with novae. This,\r\nas well as other facts, makes it probable that all these stars are\r\n\"friction variables,\" as Shapley calls them. Apparently as they pass\r\nthrough the nebulae they come in contact with its highly diffuse matter\r\nand thereby become bright much as the earth would become bright if its\r\natmosphere were filled with millions of almost infinitesimally small\r\nmeteorites. A star may also lose brilliancy if nebulous matter\r\nintervenes between it and the observer. If our sun has been subjected to\r\nany of these changes some sort of climatic effect must have been\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIn a personal communication Shapley amplifies the nebular climatic\r\nhypothesis as follows:\r\n\r\n    Within 700 light years of the sun in many directions (Taurus,\r\n    Cygnus, Ophiuchus, Scorpio) are great diffuse clouds of nebulosity,\r\n    some bright, most of them dark. The probability that stars moving in\r\n    the general region of such clouds will encounter this material is\r\n    very high, for the clouds fill enormous volumes of space,--e.g.,\r\n    probably more than a hundred thousand cubic light years in the Orion\r\n    region, and are presumably composed of rarefied gases or of dust\r\n    particles. Probably throughout all our part of space such nebulosity\r\n    exists (it is all around us, we are sure), but only in certain\r\n    regions is it dense enough to affect conspicuously the stars\r\n    involved in it. If a star moving at high velocity should collide\r\n    with a dense part of such a nebulous cloud, we should probably have\r\n    a typical nova. If the relative velocity of nebulous material and\r\n    star were low or moderate, or if the material were rare, we should\r\n    not expect a conspicuous effect on the star's light.\r\n\r\n    In the nebulous region of Orion, which is probably of unusually high\r\n    density, there are about 100 known stars, varying between 20% and\r\n    80% of their total light--all of them irregularly--some slowly, some\r\n    suddenly. Apparently they are \"friction variables.\" Some of the\r\n    variables suddenly lose 40% of their light as if blanketed by\r\n    nebulous matter. In the Trifid Nebula there are variables like those\r\n    of Orion, in Messier 8 also, and probably many of the 100 or so\r\n    around the Rho Ophiuchi region belong to this kind.\r\n\r\n    I believe that our sun could not have been a typical nova, at least\r\n    not since the Archeozoic, that is for perhaps a billion years. I\r\n    believe we have in geological climates final proof of this, because\r\n    an increase in the amount of solar radiation by 1000 times as in the\r\n    typical nova, would certainly punctuate emphatically the life cycle\r\n    on the earth, even if the cause of the nova would not at the same\r\n    time eliminate the smaller planets. But the sun may have been one of\r\n    these miniature novae or friction variables; and I believe it very\r\n    probable that its wanderings through this part of space could not\r\n    long leave its mean temperature unaffected to the amount of a few\r\n    per cent.\r\n\r\n    One reason we have not had this proposal insisted upon before is\r\n    that the data back of it are mostly new--the Orion variables have\r\n    been only recently discovered and studied, the distribution and\r\n    content of the dark nebulae are hardly as yet generally known.\r\n\r\nThis interesting hypothesis cannot be hastily dismissed. If the sun\r\nshould pass through a nebula it seems inevitable that there would be at\r\nleast slight climatic effects and perhaps catastrophic effects through\r\nthe action of the gaseous matter not only on the sun but on the earth's\r\nown atmosphere. As an explanation of the general climatic conditions of\r\nthe past, however, Shapley points out that the hypothesis has the\r\nobjection of being vague, and that nebulosity should not be regarded as\r\nmore than \"a possible factor.\" One of the chief difficulties seems to be\r\nthe enormously wide distribution of as yet undiscovered nebulous matter\r\nwhich must be assumed if any large share of the earth's repeated\r\nclimatic changes is to be ascribed to such matter. If such matter is\r\nactually abundant in space, it is hard to see how any but the nearest\r\nstars would be visible. Another objection is that there is no known\r\nnebulosity near at hand with which to connect the climatic vicissitudes\r\nof the last glacial period. Moreover, the known nebulae are so much less\r\nnumerous than stars that the chances that the sun will encounter one of\r\nthem are extremely slight. This, however, is not an objection, for\r\nShapley points out that during geological times the sun can never have\r\nvaried as much as do the novae, or even as most of the friction\r\nvariables. Thus the hypothesis stands as one that is worth\r\ninvestigating, but that cannot be finally rejected or accepted until it\r\nis made more definite and until more information is available.\r\n\r\nAnother suggested cause of solar variations is the relatively sudden\r\ncontraction of the sun such as that which sometimes occurs on the earth\r\nwhen continents are uplifted and mountains upheaved. It seems improbable\r\nthat this could have occurred in a gaseous body like the sun. Lacking,\r\nas it does, any solid crust which resists a change of form, the sun\r\nprobably shrinks steadily. Hence any climatic effects thus produced must\r\nbe extremely gradual and must tend steadily in one direction for\r\nmillions of years.\r\n\r\nStill another suggestion is that the tidal action of the stars and other\r\nbodies which may chance to approach the sun's path may cause\r\ndisturbances of the solar atmosphere. The vast kaleidoscope of space is\r\nnever quiet. The sun, the stars, and all the other heavenly bodies are\r\nmoving, often with enormous speed. Hence the effect of gravitation upon\r\nthe sun must vary constantly and irregularly, as befits the geological\r\nrequirements. In the case of the planets, however, the tidal effect does\r\nnot seem competent to produce the movements of the solar atmosphere\r\nwhich appear to be concerned in the inception of sunspots. Moreover,\r\nthere is only the most remote probability that a star and the sun will\r\napproach near enough to one another to produce a pronounced\r\ngravitational disturbance in the solar atmosphere. For instance, if it\r\nbe assumed that changes in Jupiter's tidal effect on the sun are the\r\nmain factor in regulating the present difference between sunspot maxima\r\nand sunspot minima, the chances that a star or some non-luminous body of\r\nsimilar mass will approach near enough to stimulate solar activity and\r\nthereby bring on glaciation are only one in twelve billion years, as\r\nwill be explained below. This seems to make a gravitational hypothesis\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nAnother possible cause of solar disturbances is that the stars in their\r\nflight through space may exert an electrical influence which upsets the\r\nequilibrium of the solar atmosphere. At first thought this seems even\r\nmore impossible than a gravitational effect. Electrostatic effects,\r\nhowever, differ greatly from those of tides. They vary as the diameter\r\nof a body instead of as its mass; their differentials also vary\r\ninversely as the square of the distance instead of as the cube.\r\nElectrostatic effects also increase as the fourth power of the\r\ntemperature or at least would do so if they followed the law of black\r\nbodies; they are stimulated by the approach of one body to another; and\r\nthey are cumulative, for if ions arrive from space they must accumulate\r\nuntil the body to which they have come begins to discharge them. Hence,\r\non the basis of assumptions such as those used in the preceding\r\nparagraph, the chances of an electrical disturbance of the solar\r\natmosphere sufficient to cause glaciation on the earth may be as high as\r\none in twenty or thirty million years. This seems to put an electrical\r\nhypothesis within the bounds of possibility. Further than that we cannot\r\nnow go. There may be other hypotheses which fit the facts much better,\r\nbut none seems yet to have been suggested.\r\n\r\nIn the rest of this chapter the tidal and electrical hypotheses of\r\nstellar action on the sun will be taken up in detail. The tidal\r\nhypothesis is considered because in discussions of the effect of the\r\nplanets it has hitherto held almost the entire field. The electrical\r\nhypothesis will be considered because it appears to be the best yet\r\nsuggested, although it still seems doubtful whether electrical effects\r\ncan be of appreciable importance over such vast distances as are\r\ninevitably involved. The discussion of both hypotheses will necessarily\r\nbe somewhat technical, and will appeal to the astronomer more than to\r\nthe layman. It does not form a necessary part of this book, for it has\r\nno bearing on our main thesis of the effect of the sun on the earth. It\r\nis given here because ultimately the question of changes in solar\r\nactivity during geological times must be faced.\r\n\r\nIn the astronomical portion of the following discussion we shall follow\r\nJeans[114] in his admirable attempt at a mathematical analysis of the\r\nmotions of the universe. Jeans divides the heavenly bodies into five\r\nmain types. (1) Spiral nebulae, which are thought by some astronomers to\r\nbe systems like our own in the making, and by others to be independent\r\nuniverses lying at vast distances beyond the limits of our Galactic\r\nuniverse, as it is called from the Galaxy or Milky Way. (2) Nebulae of a\r\nsmaller type, called planetary. These lie within the Galactic portion of\r\nthe universe and seem to be early stages of what may some day be stars\r\nor solar systems. (3) Binary or multiple stars, which are\r\nextraordinarily numerous. In some parts of the heavens they form 50 or\r\neven 60 per cent of the stars and in the galaxy as a whole they seem to\r\nform \"fully one third.\" (4) Star clusters. These consist of about a\r\nhundred groups of stars in each of which the stars move together in the\r\nsame direction with approximately the same velocity. These, like the\r\nspiral nebulae, are thought by some astronomers to lie outside the limits\r\nof the galaxy, but this is far from certain. (5) The solar system.\r\nAccording to Jeans this seems to be unique. It does not fit into the\r\ngeneral mathematical theory by which he explains spiral nebulae,\r\nplanetary nebulae, binary stars, and star clusters. It seems to demand a\r\nspecial explanation, such as is furnished by tidal disruption due to the\r\npassage of the sun close to another star.\r\n\r\nThe part of Jeans' work which specially concerns us is his study of the\r\nprobability that some other star will approach the sun closely enough to\r\nhave an appreciable gravitative or electrical effect, and thus cause\r\ndisturbances in the solar atmosphere. Of course both the star and the\r\nsun are moving, but to avoid circumlocution we shall speak of such\r\nmutual approaches simply as approaches of the sun. For our present\r\npurpose the most fundamental fact may be summed up in a quotation from\r\nJeans in which he says that most stars \"show evidence of having\r\nexperienced considerable disturbance by other systems; there is no\r\nreason why our solar system should be expected to have escaped the\r\ncommon fate.\" Jeans gives a careful calculation from which it is\r\npossible to derive some idea of the probability of any given degree of\r\napproach of the sun and some other star. Of course all such calculations\r\nmust be based on certain assumptions. The assumptions made by Jeans are\r\nsuch as to make the probability of close approaches as great as\r\npossible. For example, he allows only 560 million years for the entire\r\nevolution of the sun, whereas some astronomers and geologists would put\r\nthe figure ten or more times as high. Nevertheless, Jeans' assumptions\r\nat least show the order of magnitude which we may expect on the basis of\r\nreasonable astronomical conclusions.\r\n\r\nAccording to the planetary hypothesis of sunspots, the difference in the\r\neffect of Jupiter when it is nearest and farthest from the sun is the\r\nmain factor in starting the sunspot cycle and hence the corresponding\r\nterrestrial cycle. The climatic difference between sunspot maxima and\r\nminima, as measured by temperature, apparently amounts to at least a\r\ntwentieth and perhaps a tenth of the difference between the climate of\r\nthe last glacial epoch and the present. We may suppose, then, that a\r\nbody which introduced a gravitative or electrical factor twenty times as\r\ngreat as the difference in Jupiter's effect at its maximum and minimum\r\ndistances from the sun would cause a glacial epoch if the effect lasted\r\nlong enough. Of course the other planets combine their effects with that\r\nof Jupiter, but for the sake of simplicity we will leave the others out\r\nof account. The difference between Jupiter's maximum and minimum tidal\r\neffect on the sun amounts to 29 per cent of the planet's average effect.\r\nThe corresponding difference, according to the electrical hypothesis, is\r\nabout 19 per cent, for electrostatic action varies as the square of the\r\ndistance instead of as the cube. Let us assume that a body exerting four\r\ntimes Jupiter's present tidal effect and placed at the average distance\r\nof Jupiter from the sun would disturb the sun's atmosphere twenty times\r\nas much as the present difference between sunspot maxima and minima, and\r\nthus, perhaps, cause a glacial period on the earth.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of this assumption our first problem is to estimate the\r\nfrequency with which a star, visible or dark, is likely to approach near\r\nenough to the sun to produce a _tidal_ effect four times that of\r\nJupiter. The number of visible stars is known or at least well\r\nestimated. As to dark stars, which have grown cool, Arrhenius believed\r\nthat they are a hundred times as numerous as bright stars; few\r\nastronomers believe that there are less than three or four times as\r\nmany. Dr. Shapley of the Harvard Observatory states that a new\r\ninvestigation of the matter suggests that eight or ten is probably a\r\nmaximum figure. Let us assume that nine is correct. The average visible\r\nstar, so far as measured, has a mass about twice that of the sun, or\r\nabout 2100 times that of Jupiter. The distances of the stars have been\r\nmeasured in hundreds of cases and thus we can estimate how many stars,\r\nboth visible and invisible, are on an average contained in a given\r\nvolume of space. On this basis Jeans estimates that there is only one\r\nchance in thirty billion years that a visible star will approach within\r\n2.8 times the distance of Neptune from the sun, that is, within about\r\neight billion miles. If we include the invisible stars the chances\r\nbecome one in three billion years. In order to produce four times the\r\ntidal effect of Jupiter, however, the average star would have to\r\napproach within about four billion miles of the sun, and the chances of\r\nthat are only one in twelve billion years. The disturbing star would be\r\nonly 40 per cent farther from the sun than Neptune, and would almost\r\npass within the solar system.\r\n\r\nEven though Jeans holds that the frequency of the mutual approach of the\r\nsun and a star was probably much greater in the distant past than at\r\npresent, the figures just given lend little support to the tidal\r\nhypothesis. In fact, they apparently throw it out of court. It will be\r\nremembered that Jeans has made assumptions which give as high a\r\nfrequency of stellar encounters as is consistent with the astronomical\r\nfacts. We have assumed nine dark stars for every bright one, which may\r\nbe a liberal estimate. Also, although we have assumed that a disturbance\r\nof the sun's atmosphere sufficient to cause a glacial period would arise\r\nfrom a tidal effect only twenty times as great as the difference in\r\nJupiter's effect when nearest the sun and farthest away, in our\r\ncomputations this has actually been reduced to thirteen. With all these\r\nfavorable assumptions the chances of a stellar approach of the sort here\r\ndescribed are now only one in twelve billion years. Yet within a hundred\r\nmillion years, according to many estimates of geological time, and\r\nalmost certainly within a billion, there have been at least half a dozen\r\nglaciations.\r\n\r\nOur use of Jeans' data interposes another and equally insuperable\r\ndifficulty to any tidal hypothesis. Four billion miles is a very short\r\ndistance in the eyes of an astronomer. At that distance a star twice the\r\nsize of the sun would attract the outer planets more strongly than the\r\nsun itself, and might capture them. If a star should come within four\r\nbillion miles of the sun, its effect in distorting the orbits of all the\r\nplanets would be great. If this had happened often enough to cause all\r\nthe glaciations known to geologists, the planetary orbits would be\r\nstrongly elliptical instead of almost circular. The consideration here\r\nadvanced militate so strongly against the tidal hypothesis of solar\r\ndisturbances that it seems scarcely worth while to consider it further.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to the electrical hypothesis. Here the conditions are\r\nfundamentally different from those of the tidal hypothesis. In the first\r\nplace the electrostatic effect of a body has nothing to do with its\r\nmass, but depends on the area of its surface; that is, it varies as the\r\nsquare of the radius. Second, the emission of electrons varies\r\nexponentially. If hot glowing stars follow the same law as black bodies\r\nat lower temperatures, the emission of electrons, like the emission of\r\nother kinds of energy, varies as the fourth power of the absolute\r\ntemperature. In other words, suppose there are two black bodies,\r\notherwise alike, but one with a temperature of 27 deg. C. or 300 deg. on the\r\nabsolute scale, and the other with 600 deg. on the absolute scale. The\r\ntemperature of one is twice as high as that of the other, but the\r\nelectrostatic effect will be sixteen times as great.[115] Third, the\r\nnumber of electrons that reach a given body varies inversely as the\r\nsquare of the distance, instead of as the cube which is the case with\r\ntide-making forces.\r\n\r\nIn order to use these three principles in calculating the effect of the\r\nstars we must know the diameters, distances, temperature, and number of\r\nthe stars. The distances and number may safely be taken as given by\r\nJeans in the calculations already cited. As to the diameters, the\r\nmeasurements of the stars thus far made indicate that the average mass\r\nis about twice that of the sun. The average density, as deduced by\r\nShapley[116] from the movements of double stars, is about one-eighth the\r\nsolar density. This would give an average diameter about two and a half\r\ntimes that of the sun. For the dark stars, we shall assume for\r\nconvenience that they are ten times as numerous as the bright ones. We\r\nshall also assume that their diameter is half that of the sun, for being\r\ncool they must be relatively dense, and that their temperature is the\r\nsame as that which we shall assume for Jupiter.\r\n\r\nAs to Jupiter we shall continue our former assumption that a body with\r\nfour times the effectiveness of that planet, which here means with twice\r\nas great a radius, would disturb the sun enough to cause glaciation. It\r\nwould produce about twenty times the electrostatic effect which now\r\nappears to be associated with the difference in Jupiter's effect at\r\nmaximum and minimum. The temperature of Jupiter must also be taken into\r\naccount. The planet is supposed to be hot because its density is low,\r\nbeing only about 1.25 that of water. Nevertheless, it is probably not\r\nluminous, for as Moulton[117] puts it, shadows upon it are black and its\r\nmoons show no sign of illumination except from the sun. Hence a\r\ntemperature of about 600 deg.C., or approximately 900 deg. on the absolute\r\nscale, seems to be the highest that can reasonably be assigned to the\r\ncold outer layer whence electrons are emitted. As to the temperature of\r\nthe sun, we shall adopt the common estimate of about 6300 deg.C. on the\r\nabsolute scale. The other stars will be taken as averaging the same,\r\nalthough of course they vary greatly.\r\n\r\nWhen Jeans' method of calculating the probability of a mutual approach\r\nof the sun and a star is applied to the assumptions given above, the\r\nresults are as shown in Table 5. On that basis the dark stars seem to be\r\nof negligible importance so far as the electrical hypothesis is\r\nconcerned. Even though they may be ten times as numerous as the bright\r\nones there appears to be only one chance in 130 billion years that one\r\nof them will approach the sun closely enough to cause the assumed\r\ndisturbance of the solar atmosphere. On the other hand, if all the\r\nvisible stars were the size of the sun, and as hot as that body, their\r\nelectrical effect would be fourfold that of our assumed dark star\r\nbecause of their size, and 2401 times as great because of their\r\ntemperature, or approximately 10,000 times as great. Under such\r\nconditions the theoretical chance of an approach that would cause\r\nglaciation is one in 130 million years. If the average visible star is\r\nsomewhat cooler than the sun and has a radius about two and one-half\r\ntimes as great, as appears to be the fact, the chances rise to one in\r\nthirty-eight million years. A slight and wholly reasonable change in our\r\nassumptions would reduce this last figure to only five or ten million.\r\nFor instance, the earth's mean temperature during the glacial period has\r\nbeen assumed as 10 deg.C. lower than now, but the difference may have been\r\nonly 6 deg.. Again, the temperature of the outer atmosphere of Jupiter where\r\nthe electrons are shot out may be only 500 deg. or 700 deg. absolute, instead of\r\n900 deg.. Or the diameter of the average star may be five or ten times that\r\nof the sun, instead of only two and one-half times as great. All this,\r\nhowever, may for the present be disregarded. The essential point is that\r\neven when the assumptions err on the side of conservatism, the results\r\nare of an order of magnitude which puts the electrical hypothesis within\r\nthe bounds of possibility, whereas similar assumptions put the tidal\r\nhypothesis, with its single approach in twelve billion years, far beyond\r\nthose limits.\r\n\r\nThe figures for Betelgeuse in Table 5 are interesting. At a meeting of\r\nthe American Association for the Advancement of Science in December,\r\n1920, Michelson reported that by measurements of the interference of\r\nlight coming from the two sides of that bright star in Orion, the\r\nobservers at Mount Wilson had confirmed the recent estimates of three\r\nother authorities that the star's diameter is about 218 million miles,\r\nor 250 times that of the sun. If other stars so much surpass the\r\nestimates of only a decade or two ago, the average diameter of all the\r\nvisible stars must be many times that of the sun. The low figure for\r\nBetelgeuse in section D of the table means that if all the stars were as\r\nlarge as Betelgeuse, several might often be near enough to cause\r\nprofound disturbances of the solar atmosphere. Nevertheless, because of\r\nthe low temperature of the giant red stars of the Betelgeuse type, the\r\ndistance at which one of them would produce a given electrical effect is\r\nonly about five times the distance at which our assumed average star\r\nwould produce the same effect. This, to be sure, is on the assumption\r\nthat the radiation of energy from incandescent bodies varies according\r\nto temperature in the same ratio as the radiation from black bodies.\r\nEven if this assumption departs somewhat from the truth, it still seems\r\nalmost certain that the lower temperature of the red compared with the\r\nhigh temperature of the white stars must to a considerable degree reduce\r\nthe difference in electrical effect which would otherwise arise from\r\ntheir size.\r\n\r\nTABLE 5\r\n\r\nTHEORETICAL PROBABILITY OF STELLAR APPROACHES\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                   |      1        |     2     |    3     |     4      |\r\n                   |               |           |_Average  |            |\r\n                   |  _Dark Stars_ |   _Sun_   |  Star_   |_Betelgeuse_|\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  A.

No account has been\r\ntaken of the degree to which its atmosphere is disturbed. Yet in the\r\ncase of the sun this seems to be one of the most important factors. The\r\nmagnetic field of sunspots is sometimes 50 or 100 times as strong as\r\nthat of the sun in general. The strength of the magnetic field appears\r\nto depend on the strength of the electrical currents in the solar\r\natmosphere. But the intensity of the sunspots and, by inference, of the\r\nelectrical currents, may depend on the electrical action of Jupiter and\r\nthe other planets. If we apply a similar line of reasoning to the stars,\r\nwe are at once led to question whether the electrical activity of double\r\nstars may not be enormously greater than that of isolated stars like the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nIf this line of reasoning is correct, the atmosphere of every double\r\nstar must be in a state of commotion vastly greater than that of the\r\nsun's atmosphere even when it is most disturbed. For example, suppose\r\nthe sun were accompanied by a companion of equal size at a distance of\r\none million miles, which would make it much like many known double\r\nstars. Suppose also that in accordance with the general laws of physics\r\nthe electrical effect of the two suns upon one another is proportional\r\nto the fourth power of the temperature, the square of the radius, and\r\nthe inverse square of the distance. Then the effect of each sun upon the\r\nother would be sixty billion (6 x 10^{10}) times as great as the present\r\nelectrical effect of Jupiter upon the sun. Just what this would mean as\r\nto the net effect of a pair of such suns upon the electrical potential\r\nof other bodies at a distance we can only conjecture. The outstanding\r\nfact is that the electrical conditions of a double star must be\r\nradically different and vastly more intense than those of a single star\r\nlike the sun.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion carries weighty consequences. At present twenty or more\r\nstars are known to be located within about 100 trillion miles of the sun\r\n(five parsecs, as the astronomers say), or 16.5 light years. According\r\nto the assumptions employed in Table 5 an average single star would\r\ninfluence the sun enough to cause glaciation if it came within\r\napproximately 200 billion miles. If the star were double, however, it\r\nmight have an electrical capacity enormously greater than that of the\r\nsun. Then it would be able to cause glaciation at a correspondingly\r\ngreat distance. Today Alpha Centauri, the nearest known star about\r\ntwenty-five trillion miles, or 4.3 light years from the sun, and Sirius,\r\nthe brightest star in the heavens, is about fifty trillion miles away,\r\nor 8.5 light years. If these stars were single and had a diameter three\r\ntimes that of the sun, and if they were of the same temperature as has\r\nbeen assumed for Betelgeuse, which is about fifty times as far away as\r\nAlpha Centauri, the relative effects of the three stars upon the sun\r\nwould be, approximately, Betelgeuse 700, Alpha Centauri 250, Sirius 1.\r\nBut Alpha Centauri is triple and Sirius double, and both are much hotter\r\nthan Betelgeuse. Hence Alpha Centauri and even Sirius may be far more\r\neffective than Betelgeuse.\r\n\r\nThe two main components of Alpha Centauri are separated by an average\r\ndistance of about 2,200,000,000 miles, or somewhat less than that of\r\nNeptune from the sun. A third and far fainter star, one of the faintest\r\nyet measured, revolves around them at a great distance. In mass and\r\nbrightness the two main components are about like the sun, and we will\r\nassume that the same is true of their radius. Then, according to the\r\nassumptions made above, their effect in disturbing one another\r\nelectrically would be about 10,000 times the total effect of Jupiter\r\nupon the sun, or 2500 times the effect that we have assumed to be\r\nnecessary to produce a glacial period. We have already seen in Table 5\r\nthat, according to our assumptions, a single star like the sun would\r\nhave to approach within 120 billion miles of the solar system, or within\r\n2 per cent of a light year, in order to cause glaciation. By a similar\r\nprocess of reasoning it appears that if the mutual electrical excitation\r\nof the two main parts of Alpha Centauri, regardless of the third part,\r\nis proportional to the apparent excitation of the sun by Jupiter, Alpha\r\nCentauri would be 5000 times as effective as the sun. In other words, if\r\nit came within 8,500,000,000,000 miles of the sun, or 1.4 light years,\r\nit would so change the electrical conditions as to produce a glacial\r\nepoch. In that case Alpha Centauri is now so near that it introduces a\r\ndisturbing effect equal to about one-sixth of the effect needed to cause\r\nglaciation on the earth. Sirius and perhaps others of the nearer and\r\nbrighter or larger stars may also create appreciable disturbances in the\r\nelectrical condition of the sun's atmosphere, and may have done so to a\r\nmuch greater degree in the past, or be destined to do so in the future.\r\nThus an electrical hypothesis of solar disturbances seems to indicate\r\nthat the position of the sun in respect to other stars may be a factor\r\nof great importance in determining the earth's climate.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: H.

W. Richardson, 1914, pp. 326 and 334 is here added.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very familiar fact that when material bodies are heated they\r\nemit electromagnetic radiations, in the form of thermal, luminous, and\r\nactinic rays, in appreciable quantities. Such an effect is a natural\r\nconsequence of the electron and kinetic theories of matter. On the\r\nkinetic theory, temperature is a measure of the violence of the motion\r\nof the ultimate particles; and we have seen that on the electron theory,\r\nelectromagnetic radiation is a consequence of their acceleration. The\r\ncalculation of this emission from the standpoint of the electron theory\r\nalone is a very complex problem which takes us deeply into the structure\r\nof matter and which has probably not yet been satisfactorily resolved.\r\nFortunately, we can find out a great deal about these phenomena by the\r\napplication of general principles like the conservation of energy and\r\nthe second law of thermodynamics without considering special assumptions\r\nabout the ultimate constitution of matter. It is to be borne in mind\r\nthat the emission under consideration occurs at all temperatures\r\nalthough it is more marked the higher the temperature.... The energy per\r\nunit volume, _in vacuo_, of the radiation in equilibrium in an enclosure\r\nat the absolute temperature, T, is equal to a universal constant, A,\r\nmultiplied by the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Since the\r\nintensity of the radiation is equal to the energy per unit volume\r\nmultiplied by the velocity of light, it follows that the former must\r\nalso be proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature.\r\nMoreover, if E is the total emission from unit area of a perfectly black\r\nbody, we see from p. 330 that E=A'T^{4}, where A' is a new universal\r\nconstant. This result is usually known as Stefan's Law. It was suggested\r\nby Stefan in the inaccurate form that the total radiant energy of\r\nemission from bodies varies as the fourth power of the absolute\r\ntemperature, as a generalization from the results of experiments. The\r\ncredit for showing that it is a consequence of the existence of\r\nradiation pressure combined with the principles of thermodynamics is due\r\nto Bartoli and Boltzmann.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Quoted by Moulton in his Introduction to Astronomy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Introduction to Astronomy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: The term billions, here and elsewhere, is used in the\r\nAmerican sense, 10^{9}.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: The assumed number of stars here is ten times as great as\r\nin the other parts of this line.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE SUN'S JOURNEY THROUGH SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving gained some idea of the nature of the electrical hypothesis of\r\nsolar disturbances and of the possible effect of other bodies upon the\r\nsun's atmosphere, let us now compare the astronomical data with those of\r\ngeology. Let us take up five chief points for which the geologist\r\ndemands an explanation, and which any hypothesis must meet if it is to\r\nbe permanently accepted. These are (1) the irregular intervals at which\r\nglacial periods occur; (2) the division of glacial periods into epochs\r\nseparated sometimes by hundreds of thousands of years; (3) the length of\r\nglacial periods and epochs; (4) the occurrence of glacial stages and\r\nhistoric pulsations in the form of small climatic waves superposed upon\r\nthe larger waves of glacial epochs; (5) the occurrence of climatic\r\nconditions much milder than those of today, not only in the middle\r\nportion of the great geological eras, but even in some of the recent\r\ninter-glacial epochs.\r\n\r\n1. The irregular duration of the interval from one glacial epoch to\r\nanother corresponds with the irregular distribution of the stars. If\r\nglaciation is indirectly due to stellar influences, the epochs might\r\nfall close together, or might be far apart. If the average interval were\r\nten million years, one interval might be thirty million or more and the\r\nnext only one or two hundred thousand. According to Schuchert, the known\r\nperiods of glacial or semi-glacial climate have been approximately as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nLIST OF GLACIAL PERIODS\r\n\r\n  1. Archeozoic.\r\n     (1/4 of geological time or perhaps much more)\r\n\r\n      No known glacial periods.\r\n\r\n  2. Proterozoic.\r\n     (1/4 of geological time)\r\n\r\n      a. Oldest known glacial period near base of Proterozoic in\r\n         Canada. Evidence widely distributed.\r\n\r\n      b. Indian glacial period; time unknown.\r\n\r\n      c. African glacial period; time unknown.\r\n\r\n      d. Glaciation near end of Proterozoic in Australia, Norway,\r\n         and China.\r\n\r\n  3. Paleozoic.\r\n     (1/4 of geological time)\r\n\r\n      a. Late Ordovician(?). Local in Arctic Norway.\r\n\r\n      b. Silurian. Local in Alaska.\r\n\r\n      c. Early Devonian. Local in South Africa.\r\n\r\n      d. Early Permian. World-wide and very severe.\r\n\r\n  4. Mesozoic and Cenozoic.\r\n     (1/4 of geological time)\r\n\r\n      a-b. None definitely determined during Mesozoic, although\r\n        there appears to have been periods of cooling (a) in the\r\n        late Triassic, and (b) in the late Cretacic, with at least\r\n        local glaciation in early Eocene.\r\n\r\n      c. Severe glacial period during Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nThis table suggests an interesting inquiry. During the last few decades\r\nthere has been great interest in ancient glaciation and geologists have\r\ncarefully examined rocks of all ages for signs of glacial deposits. In\r\nspite of the large parts of the earth which are covered with deposits\r\nbelonging to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, which form the last quarter of\r\ngeological time, the only signs of actual glaciation are those of the\r\ngreat Pleistocene period and a few local occurrences at the end of the\r\nMesozoic or beginning of the Cenozoic. Late in the Triassic and early in\r\nthe Jurassic, the climate appears to have been rigorous, although no\r\ntillites have been found to demonstrate glaciation. In the preceding\r\nquarter, that is, the Paleozoic, the Permian glaciation was more severe\r\nthan that of the Pleistocene, and the Devonian than that of the Eocene,\r\nwhile the Ordovician evidences of low temperature are stronger than\r\nthose at the end of the Triassic. In view of the fact that rocks of\r\nPaleozoic age cover much smaller areas than do those of later age, the\r\nthree Paleozoic glaciations seem to indicate a relative frequency of\r\nglaciation. Going back to the Proterozoic, it is astonishing to find\r\nthat evidence of two highly developed glacial periods, and possibly\r\nfour, has been discovered. Since the Indian and the African glaciations\r\nof Proterozoic times are as yet undated, we cannot be sure that they are\r\nnot of the same date as the others. Nevertheless, even two is a\r\nsurprising number, for not only are most Proterozoic rocks so\r\nmetamorphosed that possible evidences of glacial origin are destroyed,\r\nbut rocks of that age occupy far smaller areas than either those of\r\nPaleozoic or, still more, Mesozoic and Cenozoic age. Thus the record of\r\nthe last three-quarters of geological time suggests that if rocks of all\r\nages were as abundant and as easily studied as those of the later\r\nperiods, the frequency of glacial periods would be found to increase as\r\none goes backward toward the beginnings of the earth's history. This is\r\ninteresting, for Jeans holds that the chances that the stars would\r\napproach one another were probably greater in the past than at present.\r\nThis conclusion is based on the assumption that our universe is like the\r\nspiral nebulae in which the orbits of the various members are nearly\r\ncircular during the younger stages. Jeans considers it certain that in\r\nsuch cases the orbits will gradually become larger and more elliptical\r\nbecause of the attraction of one body for another. Thus as time goes on\r\nthe stars will be more widely distributed and the chances of approach\r\nwill diminish. If this is correct, the agreement between astronomical\r\ntheory and geological conclusions suggests that the two are at least not\r\nin opposition.\r\n\r\nThe first quarter of geological time as well as the last three must be\r\nconsidered in this connection. During the Archeozoic, no evidence of\r\nglaciation has yet been discovered. This suggests that the geological\r\nfacts disprove the astronomical theory. But our knowledge of early\r\ngeological times is extremely limited, so limited that lack of evidence\r\nof glaciation in the Archeozoic may have no significance. Archeozoic\r\nrocks have been studied minutely over a very small percentage of the\r\nearth's land surface. Moreover, they are highly metamorphosed so that,\r\neven if glacial tills existed, it would be hard to recognize them.\r\nThird, according to both the nebular and the planetesimal hypotheses, it\r\nseems possible that during the earliest stages of geological history the\r\nearth's interior was somewhat warmer than now, and the surface may have\r\nbeen warmed more than at present by conduction, by lava flows, and by\r\nthe fall of meteorites. If the earth during the Archeozoic period\r\nemitted enough heat to raise its surface temperature a few degrees, the\r\nheat would not prevent the development of low forms of life but might\r\neffectively prevent all glaciation. This does not mean that it would\r\nprevent changes of climate, but merely changes so extreme that their\r\nrecord would be preserved by means of ice. It will be most interesting\r\nto see whether future investigations in geology and astronomy indicate\r\neither a semi-uniform distribution of glacial periods throughout the\r\npast, or a more or less regular decrease in frequency from early times\r\ndown to the present.\r\n\r\n2. The Pleistocene glacial period was divided into at least four epochs,\r\nwhile in the Permian at least one inter-glacial epoch seems certain, and\r\nin some places the alternation between glacial and non-glacial beds\r\nsuggests no less than nine. In the other glaciations the evidence is not\r\nyet clear. The question of periodicity is so important that it\r\noverthrows most glacial hypotheses. Indeed, had their authors known the\r\nfacts as established in recent years, most of the hypotheses would never\r\nhave been advanced. The carbon dioxide hypothesis is the only one which\r\nwas framed with geologically rapid climatic alternations in mind. It\r\ncertainly explains the facts of periodicity better than does any of its\r\npredecessors, but even so it does not account for the intimate way in\r\nwhich variations of all degrees from those of the weather up to glacial\r\nepochs seem to grade into one another.\r\n\r\nAccording to our stellar hypothesis, occasional groups of glacial epochs\r\nwould be expected to occur close together and to form long glacial\r\nperiods. This is because many of the stars belong to groups or clusters\r\nin which the stars move in parallel paths. A good example is the cluster\r\nin the Hyades, where Boss has studied thirty-nine stars with special\r\ncare.[120] The stars are grouped about a center about 130 light years\r\nfrom the sun. The stars themselves are scattered over an area about\r\nthirty light years in diameter. They average about the same distance\r\napart as do those near the sun, but toward the center of the group they\r\nare somewhat closer together. The whole thirty-nine sweep forward in\r\nessentially parallel paths. Boss estimates that 800,000 years ago the\r\ncluster was only half as far from the sun as at present, but probably\r\nthat was as near as it has been during recent geological times. All of\r\nthe thirty-nine stars of this cluster, as Moulton[121] puts it, \"are\r\nmuch greater in light-giving power than the sun. The luminosities of\r\neven the five smallest are from five to ten times that of the sun, while\r\nthe largest are one hundred times greater in light-giving power than our\r\nown luminary. Their masses are probably much greater than that of the\r\nsun.\" If the sun were to pass through such a cluster, first one star and\r\nthen another might come so near as to cause a profound disturbance in\r\nthe sun's atmosphere.\r\n\r\n3. Another important point upon which a glacial hypothesis may come to\r\ngrief is the length of the periods or rather of the epochs which compose\r\nthe periods. During the last or Pleistocene glacial period the evidence\r\nin America and Europe indicates that the inter-glacial epochs varied in\r\nlength and that the later ones were shorter than the earlier. Chamberlin\r\nand Salisbury, from a comparison of various authorities, estimate that\r\nthe intervals from one glacial epoch to another form a declining series,\r\nwhich may be roughly expressed as follows: 16-8-4-2-1, where unity is\r\nthe interval from the climax of the late Wisconsin, or last glacial\r\nepoch, to the present. Most authorities estimate the culmination of the\r\nlate Wisconsin glaciation as twenty or thirty thousand years ago. Penck\r\nestimates the length of the last inter-glacial period as 60,000 years\r\nand the preceding one as 240,000.[122] R. T. Chamberlin, as already\r\nstated, finds that the consensus of opinion is that inter-glacial epochs\r\nhave averaged five times as long as glacial epochs. The actual duration\r\nof the various glaciations probably did not vary in so great a ratio as\r\ndid the intervals from one glaciation to another. The main point,\r\nhowever, is the irregularity of the various periods.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the stellar electrical hypothesis to the length of\r\nglacial epochs may be estimated from column C, in Table 5. There we see\r\nthat the distances at which a star might possibly disturb the sun enough\r\nto cause glaciation range all the way from 120 billion miles in the case\r\nof a small star like the sun, to 3200 billion in the case of Betelgeuse,\r\nwhile for double stars the figure may rise a hundred times higher. From\r\nthis we can calculate how long it would take a star to pass from a point\r\nwhere its influence would first amount to a quarter of the assumed\r\nmaximum to a similar point on the other side of the sun. In making these\r\ncalculations we will assume that the relative rate at which the star and\r\nthe sun approach each other is about twenty-two miles per second, or 700\r\nmillion miles per year, which is the average rate of motion of all the\r\nknown stars. According to the distances in Table 5 this gives a range\r\nfrom about 500 years up to about 10,000, which might rise to a million\r\nin the case of double stars. Of course the time might be relatively\r\nshort if the sun and a rapidly moving star were approaching one another\r\nalmost directly, or extremely long if the sun and the star were moving\r\nin almost the same direction and at somewhat similar rates,--a condition\r\nmore common than the other. Here, as in so many other cases, the\r\nessential point is that the figures which we thus obtain seem to be of\r\nthe right order of magnitude.\r\n\r\n4. Post-glacial climatic stages are so well known that in Europe they\r\nhave definite names. Their sequence has already been discussed in\r\nChapter XII. Fossils found in the peat bogs of Denmark and Scandinavia,\r\nfor example, prove that since the final disappearance of the continental\r\nice cap at the close of the Wisconsin there has been at least one period\r\nwhen the climate of Europe was distinctly milder than now. Directly\r\noverlying the sheets of glacial drift laid down by the ice there is a\r\nflora corresponding to that of the present tundras. Next come remains of\r\na forest vegetation dominated by birches and poplars, showing that the\r\nclimate was growing a little warmer. Third, there follow evidences of a\r\nstill more favorable climate in the form of a forest dominated by pines;\r\nfourth, one where oak predominates; and fifth, a flora similar to that\r\nof the Black Forest of Germany, indicating that in Scandinavia the\r\ntemperature was then decidedly higher than today. This fifth flora has\r\nretreated southward once more, having been driven back to its present\r\nlatitude by a slight recurrence of a cool stormy climate.[123] In\r\ncentral Asia evidence of post-glacial stages is found not only in five\r\ndistinct moraines but in a corresponding series of elevated strands\r\nsurrounding salt lakes and of river terraces in non-glaciated arid\r\nregions.[124]\r\n\r\nIn historic as well as prehistoric times, as we have already seen, there\r\nhave been climatic fluctuations. For instance, the twelfth or thirteenth\r\ncentury B. C. appears to have been almost as mild as now, as does the\r\nseventh century B. C. On the other hand about 1000 B. C., at the time of\r\nChrist, and in the fourteenth century there were times of relative\r\nseverity. Thus it appears that both on a large and on a small scale\r\npulsations of climate are the rule. Any hypothesis of climatic changes\r\nmust satisfy the periods of these pulsations. These conditions furnish a\r\nproblem which makes difficulty for almost all hypotheses of climatic\r\nchange. According to the present hypothesis, earth movements such as are\r\ndiscussed in Chapter XII may cooeperate with two astronomical factors.\r\nOne is the constant change in the positions of the stars, a change which\r\nwe have already called kaleidoscopic, and the other is the fact that a\r\nlarge proportion of the stars are double or multiple. When one star in a\r\ngroup approaches the sun closely enough to cause a great solar\r\ndisturbance, numerous others may approach or recede and have a minor\r\neffect. Thus, whenever the sun is near groups of stars we should expect\r\nthat the earth would show many minor climatic pulsations and stages\r\nwhich might or might not be connected with glaciation. The historic\r\npulsations shown in the curve of tree growth in California, Fig. 4, are\r\nthe sort of changes that would be expected if movements of the stars\r\nhave an effect on the solar atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNot only are fully a third of all the visible stars double, as we have\r\nalready seen, but at least a tenth of these are known to be triple or\r\nmultiple. In many of the double stars the two bodies are close together\r\nand revolve so rapidly that whatever periodicity they might create in\r\nthe sun's atmosphere would be very short. In the triplets, however, the\r\nthird star is ordinarily at least ten times as far from the other two as\r\nthey are from each other, and its period of rotation sometimes runs into\r\nhundreds or thousands of years. An actual multiple star in the\r\nconstellation Polaris will serve as an example. The main star is\r\nbelieved by Jeans to consist of two parts which are almost in contact\r\nand whirl around each other with extraordinary speed in four days. If\r\nthis is true they must keep each other's atmospheres in a state of\r\nintense commotion. Much farther away a third star revolves around this\r\npair in twelve years. At a much greater distance a fourth star revolves\r\naround the common center of gravity of itself and the other three in a\r\nperiod which may be 20,000 years. Still more complicated cases probably\r\nexist. Suppose such a system were to traverse a path where it would\r\nexert a perceptible influence on the sun for thirty or forty thousand\r\nyears. The varying movements of its members would produce an intricate\r\nseries of cycles which might show all sorts of major and minor\r\nvariations in length and intensity. Thus the varied and irregular stages\r\nof glaciation and the pulsations of historic times might be accounted\r\nfor on the hypothesis of the proximity of the sun to a multiple star, as\r\nwell as on that of the less pronounced approach and recession of a\r\nnumber of stars. In addition to all this, an almost infinitely complex\r\nseries of climatic changes of long and short duration might arise if the\r\nsun passed through a nebula.\r\n\r\n5. We have seen in Chapter VIII that the contrast between the somewhat\r\nsevere climate of the present and the generally mild climate of the past\r\nis one of the great geological problems. The glacial period is not a\r\nthing of the distant past. Geologists generally recognize that it is\r\nstill with us. Greenland and Antarctica are both shrouded in ice sheets\r\nin latitudes where fossil floras prove that at other periods the climate\r\nwas as mild as in England or even New Zealand. The present glaciated\r\nregions, be it noted, are on the polar borders of the world's two most\r\nstormy oceanic areas, just where ice would be expected to last longest\r\naccording to the solar cyclonic hypothesis. In contrast with the\r\nsemi-glacial conditions of the present, the last inter-glacial epoch was\r\nso mild that not only men but elephants and hippopotamuses flourished in\r\ncentral Europe, while at earlier times in the middle of long eras, such\r\nas the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, corals, cycads, and tree ferns flourished\r\nwithin the Arctic circle.\r\n\r\nIf the electro-stellar hypothesis of solar disturbances proves well\r\nfounded, it may explain these peculiarities. Periods of mild climate\r\nwould represent a return of the sun and the earth to their normal\r\nconditions of quiet. At such times the atmosphere of the sun is assumed\r\nto be little disturbed by sunspots, faculae, prominences, and other\r\nallied evidences of movements; and the rice-grain structure is perhaps\r\nthe most prominent of the solar markings. The earth at such times is\r\nsupposed to be correspondingly free from cyclonic storms. Its winds are\r\nthen largely of the purely planetary type, such as trade winds and\r\nwesterlies. Its rainfall also is largely planetary rather than cyclonic.\r\nIt falls in places such as the heat equator where the air rises under\r\nthe influence of heat, or on the windward slopes of mountains, or in\r\nregions where warm winds blow from the ocean over cold lands.\r\n\r\nAccording to the electro-stellar hypothesis, the conditions which\r\nprevailed during hundreds of millions of years of mild climate mean\r\nmerely that the solar system was then in parts of the heavens where\r\nstars--especially double stars--were rare or small, and electrical\r\ndisturbances correspondingly weak. Today, on the other hand, the sun is\r\nfairly near a number of stars, many of which are large doubles. Hence it\r\nis supposed to be disturbed, although not so much as at the height of\r\nthe last glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nAfter the preceding parts of this book had been written, the assistance\r\nof Dr. Schlesinger made it possible to test the electro-stellar\r\nhypothesis by comparing actual astronomical dates with the dates of\r\nclimatic or solar phenomena. In order to make this possible, Dr.\r\nSchlesinger and his assistants have prepared Table 6, giving the\r\nposition, magnitude, and motions of the thirty-eight nearest stars, and\r\nespecially the date at which each was nearest the sun. In column 10\r\nwhere the dates are given, a minus sign indicates the past and a plus\r\nsign the future. Dr. Shapley has kindly added column 12, giving the\r\nabsolute magnitudes of the stars, that of the sun being 4.8, and column\r\n13, showing their luminosity or absolute radiation, that of the sun\r\nbeing unity. Finally, column 14 shows the effective radiation received\r\nby the sun from each star when the star is at a minimum distance. Unity\r\nin this case is the effect of a star like the sun at a distance of one\r\nlight year.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that radiation of all kinds, including light, heat, and\r\nelectrical emissions, varies in direct proportion to the exposed\r\nsurface, that is, as the square of the radius of a sphere, and inversely\r\nas the square of the distance. From black bodies, as we have seen, the\r\ntotal radiation varies as the fourth power of the absolute temperature.\r\nIt is not certain that either light or electrical emissions from\r\nincandescent bodies vary in quite this same proportion, nor is it yet\r\ncertain whether luminous and electrical emissions vary exactly together.\r\nNevertheless they are closely related. Since the light coming from each\r\nstar is accurately measured, while no information is available as to\r\nelectrical emissions, we have followed Dr. Shapley's suggestion and used\r\nthe luminosity of the stars as the best available measure of total\r\nradiation. This is presumably an approximate measure of electrical\r\nactivity, provided some allowance be made for disturbances by outside\r\nbodies such as companion stars. Hence the inclusion of column 14.\r\n\r\nTABLE 6\r\n\r\nTHIRTY-EIGHT STARS HAVING LARGEST KNOWN PARALLAXES\r\n\r\n   Star\r\n   Code\r\n   1 Groombr. 34\r\n   2 ++[Greek: e] Cassiop.\r\n   3\r\n   4 ++[Greek: k] Tucanae\r\n   5 [Greek: t] Ceti\r\n   6 [Greek: d]_2 Eridani\r\n   7 ++[Greek: e] Eridani\r\n   8 ++40(0)^2 Eridani\r\n   9  Cordoba Z. 243\r\n   10 Weisse 592\r\n   11 ++[Greek: a] Can.

This\r\ngives an estimate of the approximate electrical energy received by the\r\nsun from the nearest stars for 70,000 years before and after the\r\npresent. It is based on the twenty-six stars for which complete data are\r\navailable in Table 6. The inclusion of the other twelve would not alter\r\nthe form of the curve, for even the largest of them would not change any\r\npart by more than about half of 1 per cent, if as much. Nor would the\r\ncurve be visibly altered by the omission of all except four of the\r\ntwenty-six stars actually used. The four that are important, and their\r\nrelative luminosity when nearest the sun, are Sirius 429,000, Altair\r\n153,000, Alpha Centauri 117,500, and Procyon 51,300. The figure for the\r\nnext star is only 4970, while for this star combined with the other\r\ntwenty-one that are unimportant it is only 24,850.\r\n\r\nFigure 10 is not carried more than 70,000 years into the past or into\r\nthe future because the stars near the sun at more remote times are not\r\nincluded among the thirty-eight having the largest known parallaxes.\r\nThat is, they have either moved away or are not yet near enough to be\r\nincluded. Indeed, as Dr. Schlesinger strongly emphasizes, there may be\r\nswiftly moving, bright or gigantic stars which are now quite far away,\r\nbut whose inclusion would alter Fig. 10 even within the limits of the\r\n140,000 years there shown. It is almost certain, however, that the most\r\nthat these would do would be to raise, but not obliterate, the minima on\r\neither side of the main maximum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 10. Climatic changes of 140,000 years as inferred\r\nfrom the stars._]\r\n\r\nIn preparing Fig. 10 it has been necessary to make allowance for double\r\nstars. Passing by the twenty-two unimportant stars, it appears that the\r\ncompanion of Sirius is eight or ten magnitudes smaller than that star,\r\nwhile the companions of Procyon and Altair are five or more magnitudes\r\nsmaller than their bright comrades. This means that the luminosity of\r\nthe faint components is at most only 1 per cent of that of their bright\r\ncompanions and in the case of Sirius not a hundredth of 1 per cent.\r\nHence their inclusion would have no visible effect on Fig. 10. In Alpha\r\nCentauri, on the other hand, the two components are of almost the same\r\nmagnitude. For this reason the effective radiation of that star as given\r\nin column 14 is doubled in Fig. 10, while for another reason it is\r\nraised still more. The other reason is that if our inferences as to the\r\nelectrical effect of the sun on the earth and of the planets on the sun\r\nare correct, double stars, as we have seen, must be much more effective\r\nelectrically than single stars. By the same reasoning two bright stars\r\nclose together must excite one another much more than a bright star and\r\na very faint one, even if the distances in both cases are the same. So,\r\ntoo, other things being equal, a triple star must be more excited\r\nelectrically than a double star. Hence in preparing Fig. 10 all double\r\nstars receive double weight and each part of Alpha Centauri receives an\r\nadditional 50 per cent because both parts are bright and because they\r\nhave a third companion to help in exciting them.\r\n\r\nAccording to the electro-stellar hypothesis, Alpha Centauri is more\r\nimportant climatically than any other star in the heavens not only\r\nbecause it is triple and bright, but because it is the nearest of all\r\nstars, and moves fairly rapidly. Sirius and Procyon move slowly in\r\nrespect to the sun, only about eleven and eight kilometers per second\r\nrespectively, and their distances at minimum are fairly large, that is,\r\n8 and 10.2 light years. Hence their effect on the sun changes slowly.\r\nAltair moves faster, about twenty-six kilometers per second, and its\r\nminimum distance is 6.4 light years, so that its effect changes fairly\r\nrapidly. Alpha Centauri moves about twenty-four kilometers per second,\r\nand its minimum distance is only 3.2 light years. Hence its effect\r\nchanges very rapidly, the change in its apparent luminosity as seen from\r\nthe sun amounting at maximum to about 30 per cent in 10,000 years\r\nagainst 14 per cent for Altair, 4 for Sirius, and 2 for Procyon. The\r\nvast majority of the stars change so much more slowly than even Procyon\r\nthat their effect is almost uniform. All the stars at a distance of more\r\nthan perhaps twenty or thirty light years may be regarded as sending to\r\nthe sun a practically unchanging amount of radiation. It is the bright\r\nstars within this limit which are important, and their importance\r\nincreases with their proximity, their speed of motion, and the\r\nbrightness and number of their companions. Hence Alpha Centauri causes\r\nthe main maximum in Fig. 10, while Sirius, Altair, and Procyon combine\r\nto cause a general rise of the curve from the past to the future.\r\n\r\nLet us now interpret Fig. 10 geologically. The low position of the curve\r\nfifty to seventy thousand years ago suggests a mild inter-glacial\r\nclimate distinctly less severe than that of the present. Geologists say\r\nthat such was the case. The curve suggests a glacial epoch culminating\r\nabout 28,000 years ago. The best authorities put the climax of the last\r\nglacial epoch between twenty-five and thirty thousand years ago. The\r\ncurve shows an amelioration of climate since that time, although it\r\nsuggests that there is still considerable severity. The retreat of the\r\nice from North America and Europe, and its persistence in Greenland and\r\nAntarctica agree with this. And the curve indicates that the change of\r\nclimate is still persisting, a conclusion in harmony with the evidence\r\nas to historic changes.\r\n\r\nIf Alpha Centauri is really so important, the effect of its variations,\r\nprovided it has any, ought perhaps to be evident in the sun. The\r\nactivity of the star's atmosphere presumably varies, for the orbits of\r\nthe two components have an eccentricity of 0.51. Hence during their\r\nperiod of revolution, 81.2 years, the distance between them ranges from\r\n1,100,000,000 to 3,300,000,000 miles. They were at a minimum distance in\r\n1388, 1459, 1550, 1631, 1713, 1794, 1875, and will be again in 1956. In\r\nFig. 11, showing sunspot variations, it is noticeable that the years\r\n1794 and 1875 come just at the ends of periods of unusual solar\r\nactivity, as indicated by the heavy horizontal line. A similar period of\r\ngreat activity seems to have begun about 1914. If its duration equals\r\nthe average of its two predecessors, it will end about 1950. Back in the\r\nfourteenth century a period of excessive solar activity, which has\r\nalready been described, culminated from 1370 to 1385, or just before the\r\ntwo parts of Alpha Centauri were at a minimum distance. Thus in three\r\nand perhaps four cases the sun has been unusually active during a time\r\nwhen the two parts of the star were most rapidly approaching each other\r\nand when their atmospheres were presumably most disturbed and their\r\nelectrical emanations strongest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 11. Sunspot curve showing cycles, 1750 to 1920._\r\n\r\n_Note._ The asterisks indicate two absolute minima of sunspots in 1810\r\nand 1913, and the middle years (1780 and 1854) of two periods when the\r\nsunspot maxima never fell below 95. If Alpha Centauri has an effect on\r\nthe sun's atmosphere, the end of another such period would be expected\r\nnot far from 1957.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that Alpha Centauri, the star which would be expected most\r\nstrongly to influence the sun, and hence the earth, was nearest the sun\r\nat the climax of the last glacial epoch, and that today the solar\r\natmosphere is most active when the star is presumably most disturbed may\r\nbe of no significance. It is given for what it is worth. Its importance\r\nlies not in the fact that it proves anything but that no contradiction\r\nis found when we test the electro-stellar hypothesis by facts which were\r\nnot thought of when the hypothesis was framed. A vast amount of\r\nastronomical work is still needed before the matter can be brought to\r\nany definite conclusion. In case the hypothesis stands firm, it may be\r\npossible to use the stars as a help in determining the exact chronology\r\nof the later part of geological times. If the hypothesis is disproved,\r\nit will merely leave the question of solar variations where it is today.\r\nIt will not influence the main conclusions of this book as to the causes\r\nand nature of climatic changes. Its value lies in the fact that it calls\r\nattention to new lines of research.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Lewis Boss: Convergent of a Moving Cluster in Taurus;\r\nAstronom.

Several times in the\r\npreceding pages there has been mention of the fact that periods of\r\nextreme climatic fluctuations are closely associated with great\r\nmovements of the earth's crust whereby mountains are uplifted and\r\ncontinents upheaved. In attempting to explain this association the\r\ngeneral tendency has been to look largely at the past instead of the\r\npresent. Hence it has been almost impossible to choose among three\r\npossibilities, all beset with difficulties. First, the movements of the\r\ncrust may have caused the climatic fluctuations; second, climatic\r\nchanges may cause crustal movements; and third, variations in solar\r\nactivity or in some other outside agency may give rise to both types of\r\nterrestrial phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe idea that movements of the earth's crust are the main cause of\r\ngeological changes of climate is becoming increasingly untenable as the\r\ncomplexity and rapidity of climatic changes become more clear,\r\nespecially during post-glacial times. It implies that the earth's\r\nsurface moves up and down with a speed and facility which appear to be\r\nout of the question. If volcanic activity be invoked the problem becomes\r\nno clearer. Even if volcanic dust should fill the air frequently and\r\ncompletely, neither its presence nor absence would produce such peculiar\r\nfeatures as the localization of glaciers, the distribution of loess, and\r\nthe mild climate of most parts of geological time. Nevertheless, because\r\nof the great difficulties presented by the other two possibilities many\r\ngeologists still hold that directly or indirectly the greater climatic\r\nchanges have been mainly due to movements of the earth's crust and to\r\nthe reaction of the crustal movements on the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe possibility that climatic changes are in themselves a cause of\r\nmovements of the earth's crust seems so improbable that no one appears\r\nto have investigated it with any seriousness. Nevertheless, it is worth\r\nwhile to raise the question whether climatic extremes may cooeperate with\r\nother agencies in setting the time when the earth's crust shall be\r\ndeformed.\r\n\r\nAs to the third possibility, it is perfectly logical to ascribe both\r\nclimatic changes and crustal deformation to some outside agency, solar\r\nor otherwise, but hitherto there has been so little evidence on this\r\npoint that such an ascription has merely begged the question. If\r\nheavenly bodies should approach the earth closely enough so that their\r\ngravitational stresses caused crustal deformation, all life would\r\npresumably be destroyed. As to the sun, there has hitherto been no\r\nconclusive evidence that it is related to crustal movements, although\r\nvarious writers have made suggestions along this line. In this chapter\r\nwe shall carry these suggestions further and shall see that they are at\r\nleast worthy of study.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to this study it may be well to note that the\r\ncoincidence between movements of the earth's crust and climatic changes\r\nis not so absolute as is sometimes supposed. For example, the profound\r\ncrustal changes at the end of the Mesozoic were not accompanied by\r\nwidespread glaciation so far as is yet known, although the temperature\r\nappears to have been lowered. Nor was the violent volcanic and\r\ndiastrophic activity in the Miocene associated with extreme climates.\r\nIndeed, there appears to have been little contrast from zone to zone,\r\nfor figs, bread fruit trees, tree ferns, and other plants of low\r\nlatitudes grew in Greenland. Nevertheless, both at the end of the\r\nMesozoic and in the Miocene the climate may possibly have been severe\r\nfor a time, although the record is lost. On the other hand, Kirk's\r\nrecent discovery of glacial till in Alaska between beds carrying an\r\nundoubted Middle Silurian fauna indicates glaciation at a time when\r\nthere was little movement of the crust so far as yet appears.[125] Thus\r\nwe conclude that while climatic changes and crustal movements usually\r\noccur together, they may occur separately.\r\n\r\nAccording to the solar-cyclonic hypothesis such a condition is to be\r\nexpected. If the sun were especially active when the terrestrial\r\nconditions prohibited glaciation, changes of climate would still occur,\r\nbut they would be milder than under other circumstances, and would leave\r\nlittle record in the rocks. Or there might be glaciation in high\r\nlatitudes, such as that of southern Alaska in the Middle Silurian, and\r\nnone elsewhere. On the other hand, when the sun was so inactive that no\r\ngreat storminess occurred, the upheaval of continents and the building\r\nof mountains might go on without the formation of ice sheets, as\r\napparently happened at the end of the Mesozoic. The lack of absolute\r\ncoincidence between glaciation and periods of widespread emergence of\r\nthe lands is evident even today, for there is no reason to suppose that\r\nthe lands are notably lower or less extensive now than they were during\r\nthe Pleistocene glaciation. In fact, there is much evidence that many\r\nareas have risen since that time. Yet glaciation is now far less\r\nextensive than in the Pleistocene. Any attempt to explain this\r\ndifference on the basis of terrestrial changes is extremely difficult,\r\nfor the shape and altitude of continents and mountains have not changed\r\nmuch in twenty or thirty thousand years. Yet the present moderately mild\r\nepoch, like the puzzling inter-glacial epochs of earlier times, is\r\neasily explicable on the assumption that the sun's atmosphere may\r\nsometimes vary in harmony with crustal activity, but does not\r\nnecessarily do so at all times.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the main problem of how climatic changes may be connected\r\nwith movements of the earth's crust, let us follow our usual method and\r\nexamine what is happening today. Let us first inquire whether\r\nearthquakes, which are one of the chief evidences that crustal movements\r\nare actually taking place in our own times, show any connection with\r\nsunspots. In order to test this, we have compared _Milne's Catalogue of\r\nDestructive Earthquakes_ from 1800 to 1899, with Wolf's sunspot numbers\r\nfor the same period month by month. The earthquake catalogue, as its\r\ncompiler describes it, \"is an attempt to give a list of earthquakes\r\nwhich have announced changes of geological importance in the earth's\r\ncrust; movements which have probably resulted in the creation or the\r\nextension of a line of fault, the vibrations accompanying which could,\r\nwith proper instruments, have been recorded over a continent or the\r\nwhole surface of our world. Small earthquakes have been excluded, while\r\nthe number of large earthquakes both for ancient and modern times has\r\nbeen extended. As an illustration of exclusion, I may mention that\r\nbetween 1800 and 1808, which are years taken at random, I find in\r\nMallet's catalogue 407 entries. Only thirty-seven of these, which were\r\naccompanied by structural damage, have been retained. Other catalogues\r\nsuch as those of Perry and Fuchs have been treated similarly.\"[126]\r\n\r\nIf the earthquakes in such a carefully selected list bear a distinct\r\nrelation to sunspots, it is at least possible and perhaps probable that\r\na similar relation may exist between solar activity and geological\r\nchanges in the earth's crust. The result of the comparison of\r\nearthquakes and sunspots is shown in Table 7. The first column gives the\r\nsunspot numbers; the second, the number of months that had the\r\nrespective spot numbers during the century from 1800 to 1899. Column C\r\nshows the total number of earthquakes during the months having any\r\nparticular degree of spottedness; while D, which is the significant\r\ncolumn, gives the average number of destructive earthquakes per month\r\nunder each of the six conditions of solar spottedness. The regularity of\r\ncolumn D is so great as to make it almost certain that we are here\r\ndealing with a real relationship. Column F, which shows the average\r\nnumber of earthquakes in the month succeeding any given condition of the\r\nsun, is still more regular except for the last entry.\r\n\r\nTABLE 7\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTIVE EARTHQUAKES FROM 1800 TO 1899 COMPARED WITH SUNSPOTS\r\n\r\n  A: _Sunspot numbers_\r\n  B: _Number of months per Wolf's Table_\r\n  C: _Number of earthquakes_\r\n  D: _Average number of earthquakes per month_\r\n  E: _Number of earthquakes in succeeding month_\r\n  F: _Average number of earthquakes in succeeding month_\r\n\r\n        A       B          C            D            E           F\r\n\r\n       0-15   344        522          1.52         512          1.49\r\n      15-30   194        306          1.58         310          1.60\r\n      30-50   237        433          1.83         439          1.85\r\n      50-70   195        402          2.06         390          2.00\r\n     70-100   135        286          2.12         310          2.30\r\n   over 100    95        218          2.30         175          1.84\r\n\r\nThe chance that six numbers taken at random will arrange themselves in\r\nany given order is one in 720. In other words, there is one chance in\r\n720 that the regularity of column D is accidental. But column F is as\r\nregular as column D except for the last entry. If columns D and E were\r\nindependent there would be one chance in about 500,000 that the six\r\nnumbers in both columns would fall in the same order, and one chance in\r\n14,400 that five numbers in each would fall in the same order. But the\r\ntwo columns are somewhat related, for although the after-shocks of a\r\ngreat earthquake are never included in Milne's table, a world-shaking\r\nearthquake in one region during a given month probably creates\r\nconditions that favor similar earthquakes elsewhere during the next\r\nmonth. Hence the probability that we are dealing with a purely\r\naccidental arrangement in Table 7 is less than one in 14,400 and greater\r\nthan one in 500,000. It may be one in 20,000 or 100,000. In any event it\r\nis so slight that there is high probability that directly or indirectly\r\nsunspots and earthquakes are somehow connected.\r\n\r\nIn ascertaining the relation between sunspots and earthquakes it would\r\nbe well if we could employ the strict method of correlation\r\ncoefficients. This, however, is impossible for the entire century, for\r\nthe record is by no means homogeneous. The earlier decades are\r\nrepresented by only about one-fourth as many earthquakes as the later\r\nones, a condition which is presumably due to lack of information. This\r\nmakes no difference with the method employed in Table 7, since years\r\nwith many and few sunspots are distributed almost equally throughout the\r\nentire nineteenth century, but it renders the method of correlation\r\ncoefficients inapplicable. During the period from 1850 onward the record\r\nis much more nearly homogeneous, though not completely so. Even in these\r\nlater decades, however, allowance must be made for the fact that there\r\nare more earthquakes in winter than in summer, the average number per\r\nmonth for the fifty years being as follows:\r\n\r\n    Jan. 2.8              May  2.4              Sept. 2.5\r\n    Feb. 2.4              June 2.3              Oct.  2.6\r\n    Mar. 2.5              July 2.4              Nov.  2.7\r\n    Apr. 2.4              Aug. 2.4              Dec.  2.8\r\n\r\nThe correlation coefficient between the departures from these monthly\r\naverages and the corresponding departures from the monthly averages of\r\nthe sunspots for the same period, 1850-1899, are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Sunspots and earthquakes of same month: +0.042, or 1.5 times the\r\n    probable error.\r\n\r\n    Sunspots of a given month and earthquakes of that month and the\r\n    next: +0.084, or 3.1 times the probable error.\r\n\r\n    Sunspots of three consecutive months and earthquakes of three\r\n    consecutive months allowing a lag of one month, i.e., sunspots of\r\n    January, February, and March compared with earthquakes of February,\r\n    March, and April; sunspots of February, March, and April with\r\n    earthquakes of March, April, and May, etc.; +0.112, or 4.1 times the\r\n    probable error.\r\n\r\nThese coefficients are all small, but the number of individual cases,\r\n600 months, is so large that the probable error is greatly reduced,\r\nbeing only +-0.027 or +-0.028. Moreover, the nature of our data is such\r\nthat even if there is a strong connection between solar changes and\r\nearth movements, we should not expect a large correlation coefficient.\r\nIn the first place, as already mentioned, the earthquake data are not\r\nstrictly homogeneous. Second, an average of about two and one-half\r\nstrong earthquakes per month is at best only a most imperfect indication\r\nof the actual movement of the earth's crust. Third, the sunspots are\r\nonly a partial and imperfect measure of the activity of the sun's\r\natmosphere. Fourth, the relation between solar activity and earthquakes\r\nis almost certainly indirect. In view of all these conditions, the\r\nregularity of Table 7 and the fact that the most important correlation\r\ncoefficient rises to more than four times the probable error makes it\r\nalmost certain that the solar and terrestrial phenomena are really\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nWe are now confronted by the perplexing question of how this connection\r\ncan take place. Thus far only three possibilities present themselves,\r\nand each is open to objections. The chief agencies concerned in these\r\nthree possibilities are heat, electricity, and atmospheric pressure.\r\nHeat may be dismissed very briefly. We have seen that the earth's\r\nsurface becomes relatively cool when the sun is active. Theoretically\r\neven the slightest change in the temperature of the earth's surface must\r\ninfluence the thermal gradient far into the interior and hence cause a\r\nchange of volume which might cause movements of the crust. Practically\r\nthe heat of the surface ceases to be of appreciable importance at a\r\ndepth of perhaps twenty feet, and even at that depth it does not act\r\nquickly enough to cause the relatively prompt response which seems to be\r\ncharacteristic of earthquakes in respect to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe second possibility is based on the relationship between solar and\r\nterrestrial electricity. When the sun is active the earth's atmospheric\r\nelectrical potential is subject to slight variations. It is well known\r\nthat when two opposing points of an ionized solution are oppositely\r\ncharged electrically, a current passes through the liquid and sets up\r\nelectrolysis whereby there is a segregation of materials, and a\r\nconsequent change in the volume of the parts near the respective\r\nelectrical poles. The same process takes place, although less freely, in\r\na hot mass such as forms the interior of the earth. The question arises\r\nwhether internal electrical currents may not pass between the two\r\noppositely charged poles of the earth, or even between the great\r\ncontinental masses and the regions of heavier rock which underlie the\r\noceans. Could this lead to electrolysis, hence to differentiation in\r\nvolume, and thus to movements of the earth's crust? Could the results\r\nvary in harmony with the sun? Bowie[127] has shown that numerous\r\nmeasurements of the strength and direction of the earth's gravitative\r\npull are explicable only on the assumption that the upheaval of a\r\ncontinent or a mountain range is due in part not merely to pressure, or\r\neven to flowage of the rocks beneath the crust, but also to an actual\r\nchange in volume whereby the rocks beneath the continent attain\r\nrelatively great volume and those under the oceans a small volume in\r\nproportion to their weight. The query arises whether this change of\r\nvolume may be related to electrical currents at some depth below the\r\nearth's surface.\r\n\r\nThe objections to this hypothesis are numerous. First, there is little\r\nevidence of electrolytic differentiation in the rocks. Second, the outer\r\npart of the earth's crust is a very poor conductor so that it is\r\ndoubtful whether even a high degree of electrification of the surface\r\nwould have much effect on the interior. Third, electrolysis due to any\r\nsuch mild causes as we have here postulated must be an extremely slow\r\nprocess, too slow, presumably, to have any appreciable result within a\r\nmonth or two. Other objections join with these three in making it seem\r\nimprobable that the sun's electrical activity has any direct effect upon\r\nmovements of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nThe third, or meteorological hypothesis, which makes barometric pressure\r\nthe main intermediary between solar activity and earthquakes, seems at\r\nfirst sight almost as improbable as the thermal and electrical\r\nhypotheses. Nevertheless, it has a certain degree of observational\r\nsupport of a kind which is wholly lacking in the other two cases. Among\r\nthe extensive writings on the periodicity of earthquakes one main fact\r\nstands out with great distinctness: earthquakes vary in number according\r\nto the season. This fact has already been shown incidentally in the\r\ntable of earthquake frequency by months. If allowance is made for the\r\nfact that February is a short month, there is a regular decrease in the\r\nfrequency of severe earthquakes from December and January to June. Since\r\nmost of Milne's earthquakes occurred in the northern hemisphere, this\r\nmeans that severe earthquakes occur in winter about 20 per cent oftener\r\nthan in summer.\r\n\r\nThe most thorough investigation of this subject seems to have been that\r\nof Davisson.[128] His results have been worked over and amplified by\r\nKnott,[129] who has tested them by Schuster's exact mathematical\r\nmethods. His results are given in Table 8.[130] Here the northern\r\nhemisphere is placed first; then come the East Indies and the Malay\r\nArchipelago lying close to the equator; and finally the southern\r\nhemisphere. In the northern hemisphere practically all the maxima come\r\nin the winter, for the month of December appears in fifteen cases out of\r\nthe twenty-five in column D, while January, February, or November\r\nappears in six others. It is also noticeable that in sixteen cases out\r\nof twenty-five the ratio of the actual to the expected amplitude in\r\ncolumn G is four or more, so that a real relationship is indicated,\r\nwhile the ratio falls below three only in Japan and Zante. The\r\nequatorial data, unlike those of the northern hemisphere, are\r\nindefinite, for in the East Indies no month shows a marked maximum and\r\nthe expected amplitude exceeds the actual amplitude. Even in the Malay\r\nArchipelago, which shows a maximum in May, the ratio of actual to\r\nexpected amplitude is only 2.6. Turning to the southern hemisphere, the\r\nwinter months of that hemisphere are as strongly marked by a maximum as\r\nare the winter months of the northern hemisphere. July or August appears\r\nin five out of six cases. Here the ratio between the actual and expected\r\namplitudes is not so great as in the northern hemisphere. Nevertheless,\r\nit is practically four in Chile, and exceeds five in Peru and Bolivia,\r\nand in the data for the entire southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nTABLE 8\r\n\r\nSEASONAL MARCH OF EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\nAFTER DAVISSON AND KNOTT\r\n\r\n  A: _Region_\r\n  B: _Limiting Dates_\r\n  C: _Number of Shocks_\r\n  D: _Maximum Month_\r\n  E: _Amplitude_\r\n  F: _Expected Amplitude_\r\n  G: _Ratio of Actual to Expected Amplitude_\r\n\r\n           A              B       C        D        E      F        G\r\n\r\n  Northern Hemisphere  223-1850  5879     Dec.    0.110   0.023    4.8\r\n  Northern Hemisphere 1865-1884  8133     Dec.    0.290   0.020   14.5\r\n  Europe              1865-1884  5499     Dec.    0.350   0.024   14.6\r\n  Europe               306-1843  1961     Dec.    0.220   0.040    5.5\r\n  Southeast Europe    1859-1887  3470     Dec.    0.210   0.030    7.0\r\n  Vesuvius District   1865-1883   513     Dec.    0.250   0.078    3.2\r\n  Italy:\r\n    Old Tromometre    1872-1887 61732     Dec.    0.490   0.007   70.0\r\n    Old Tromometre    1876-1887 38546     Dec.    0.460   0.009   49.5\r\n    Normal Tromometre 1876-1887 38546     Dec.    0.490   0.009   52.8\r\n  Balkan, etc.        1865-1884   624     Dec.    0.270   0.071    3.8\r\n  Hungary, etc.       1865-1884   384     Dec.    0.310   0.090    3.4\r\n  Italy               1865-1883  2350  Dec.(Sept.)0.140   0.037    3.8\r\n  Grecian Archip.     1859-1881  3578   Dec.-Jan. 0.164   0.030    5.5\r\n  Austria             1865-1884   461     Jan.    0.370   0.083    4.4\r\n  Switzerland, etc.   1865-1883   524     Jan.    0.560   0.077    7.3\r\n  Asia                1865-1884   458     Feb.    0.330   0.083    4.0\r\n  North America       1865-1884   552     Nov.    0.350   0.075    4.7\r\n  California          1850-1886   949     Oct.    0.300   0.058    5.2\r\n  Japan               1878-1881   246     Dec.    0.460   0.113    4.1\r\n  Japan               1872-1880   367  Dec.-Jan.  0.256   0.093    2.8\r\n  Japan               1876-1891  1104     Feb.    0.190   0.053    3.6\r\n  Japan               1885-1889  2997     Oct.    0.080   0.032    2.5\r\n  Zante               1825-1863  1326     Aug.    0.100   0.049    2.0\r\n  Italy, North        1865-1883  1513 Sept.(Nov.) 0.210   0.046    4.6\r\n        of Naples\r\n  East Indies         1873-1881   515 Aug., Oct., 0.071?  0.078    0.9\r\n                                        or Dec.?\r\n  Malay Archip.       1865-1884   598     May     0.190   0.072    2.6\r\n  New Zealand         1869-1879   585  Aug.-Sept. 0.203   0.073    2.8\r\n  Chile               1873-1881   212     July    0.480   0.122    3.9\r\n  Southern Hemisphere 1865-1884   751     July    0.370   0.065    5.7\r\n  New Zealand         1868-1890   641  March, May 0.050   0.070    0.7\r\n  Chile               1865-1883?  316  July, Dec. 0.270   0.100    2.7\r\n  Peru, Bolivia       1865-1884   350     July    0.480   0.095    5.1\r\n\r\nThe whole relationship between earthquakes and the seasons in the\r\nnorthern and southern hemispheres is summed up in Fig. 12 taken from\r\nKnott. The northern hemisphere shows a regular diminution in earthquake\r\nfrequency from December until June, and an increase the rest of the\r\nyear. In the southern hemisphere the course of events is the same so far\r\nas summer and winter are concerned, for August with its maximum comes in\r\nwinter, while February with its minimum comes in summer. In the southern\r\nhemisphere the winter month of greatest seismic activity has over 100\r\nper cent more earthquakes than the summer month of least activity. In\r\nthe northern hemisphere this difference is about 80 per cent, but this\r\nsmaller figure occurs partly because the northern data include certain\r\ninteresting and significant regions like Japan and China where the usual\r\nconditions are reversed.[131] If equatorial regions were included in\r\nFig. 12, they would give an almost straight line.\r\n\r\nThe connection between earthquakes and the seasons is so strong that\r\nalmost no students of seismology question it, although they do not agree\r\nas to its cause. A meteorological hypothesis seems to be the only\r\nlogical explanation.[132] Wherever sufficient data are available,\r\nearthquakes appear to be most numerous when climatic conditions cause\r\nthe earth's surface to be most heavily loaded or to change its load most\r\nrapidly. The main factor in the loading is apparently atmospheric\r\npressure. This acts in two ways. First, when the continents become cold\r\nin winter the pressure increases. On an average the air at sea level\r\npresses upon the earth's surface at the rate of 14.7 pounds per square\r\ninch, or over a ton per square foot, and only a little short of thirty\r\nmillion tons per square mile. An average difference of one inch between\r\nthe atmospheric pressure of summer and winter over ten million square\r\nmiles of the continent of Asia, for example, means that the continent's\r\nload in winter is about ten million million tons heavier than in summer.\r\nSecond, the changes in atmospheric pressure due to the passage of storms\r\nare relatively sharp and sudden. Hence they are probably more effective\r\nthan the variations in the load from season to season. This is suggested\r\nby the rapidity with which the terrestrial response seems to follow the\r\nsupposed solar cause of earthquakes. It is also suggested by the fact\r\nthat violent storms are frequently followed by violent earthquakes.\r\n\"Earthquake weather,\" as Dr. Schlesinger suggests, is a common phrase in\r\nthe typhoon region of Japan, China, and the East Indies. During tropical\r\nhurricanes a change of pressure amounting to half an inch in two hours\r\nis common. On September 22, 1885, at False Point Lighthouse on the Bay\r\nof Bengal, the barometer fell about an inch in six hours, then nearly an\r\ninch and a half in not much over two hours, and finally rose fully two\r\ninches inside of two hours. A drop of two inches in barometric pressure\r\nmeans that a load of about two million tons is removed from each square\r\nmile of land; the corresponding rise of pressure means the addition of a\r\nsimilar load. Such a storm, and to a less degree every other storm,\r\nstrikes a blow upon the earth's surface, first by removing millions of\r\ntons of pressure and then by putting them on again.[133] Such storms, as\r\nwe have seen, are much more frequent and severe when sunspots are\r\nnumerous than at other times. Moreover, as Veeder[134] long ago showed,\r\none of the most noteworthy evidences of a connection between sunspots\r\nand the weather is a sudden increase of pressure in certain widely\r\nseparated high pressure areas. In most parts of the world winter is not\r\nonly the season of highest pressure and of most frequent changes of\r\nVeeder's type, but also of severest storms. Hence a meteorological\r\nhypothesis would lead to the expectation that earthquakes would occur\r\nmore frequently in winter than in summer. On the Chinese coast, however,\r\nand also on the oceanic side of Japan, as well as in some more tropical\r\nregions, the chief storms come in summer in the form of typhoons. These\r\nare the places where earthquakes also are most abundant in summer. Thus,\r\nwherever we turn, storms and the related barometric changes seem to be\r\nmost frequent and severe at the very times when earthquakes are also\r\nmost frequent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 12. Seasonal distribution of earthquakes. (After\r\nDavisson and Knott.)_\r\n\r\n  solid line   ----  Northern Hemisphere.\r\n  dashed line  ....  Southern Hemisphere.]\r\n\r\nOther meteorological factors, such as rain, snow, winds, and currents,\r\nprobably have some effect on earthquakes through their ability to load\r\nthe earth's crust. The coming of vegetation may also help. These\r\nagencies, however, appear to be of small importance compared with the\r\nstorms. In high latitudes and in regions of abundant storminess most of\r\nthese factors generally combine with barometric pressure to produce\r\nfrequent changes in the load of the earth's crust, especially in winter.\r\nIn low latitudes, on the other hand, there are few severe storms, and\r\nrelatively little contrast in pressure and vegetation from season to\r\nseason; there is no snow; and the amount of ground water changes little.\r\nWith this goes the twofold fact that there is no marked seasonal\r\ndistribution of earthquakes, and that except in certain local volcanic\r\nareas, earthquakes appear to be rare. In proportion to the areas\r\nconcerned, for example, there is little evidence of earthquakes in\r\nequatorial Africa and South America.\r\n\r\nThe question of the reality of the connection between meteorological\r\nconditions and crustal movements is so important that every possible\r\ntest should be applied. At the suggestion of Professor Schlesinger we\r\nhave looked up a very ingenious line of inquiry. During the last decades\r\nof the nineteenth century, a long series of extremely accurate\r\nobservations of latitude disclosed a fact which had previously been\r\nsuspected but not demonstrated, namely, that the earth wabbles a little\r\nabout its axis. The axis itself always points in the same direction, and\r\nsince the earth slides irregularly around it the latitude of all parts\r\nof the earth keeps changing. Chandler has shown that the wabbling thus\r\ninduced consists of two parts. The first is a movement in a circle with\r\na radius of about fifteen feet which is described in approximately 430\r\ndays. This so-called Eulerian movement is a normal gyroscopic motion\r\nlike the slow gyration of a spinning top. This depends on purely\r\nastronomical causes, and no terrestrial cause can stop it or eliminate\r\nit. The period appears to be constant, but there are certain puzzling\r\nirregularities. The usual amplitude of this movement, as\r\nSchlesinger[135] puts it, \"is about 0\".27, but twice in recent years it\r\nhas jumped to 0\".40. Such a change could be accounted for by supposing\r\nthat the earth had received a severe blow or a series of milder blows\r\ntending in the same direction.\" These blows, which were originally\r\nsuggested by Helmert are most interesting in view of our suggestion as\r\nto the blows struck by storms.\r\n\r\nThe second movement of the pole has a period of a year, and is roughly\r\nan ellipse whose longest radius is fourteen feet and the shortest, four\r\nfeet; or, to put it technically, there is an annual term with a maximum\r\namplitude of about 0\".20. This, however, varies irregularly. The result\r\nis that the pole seems to wander over the earth's surface in the spiral\r\nfashion illustrated in Fig. 13. It was early suggested that this\r\npeculiar wandering of the pole in an annual period must be due to\r\nmeteorological causes. Jeffreys[136] has investigated the matter\r\nexhaustively. He assumes certain reasonable values for the weight of air\r\nadded or subtracted from different parts of the earth's surface\r\naccording to the seasons. He also considers the effect of precipitation,\r\nvegetation, and polar ice, and of variations of temperature and\r\natmospheric pressure in their relation to movements of the ocean. Then\r\nhe proceeds to compare all these with the actual wandering of the pole\r\nfrom 1907 to 1913. While it is as yet too early to say that any special\r\nmovement of the pole was due to the specific meteorological conditions\r\nof any particular year, Jeffreys' work makes it clear that\r\nmeteorological causes, especially atmospheric pressure, are sufficient\r\nto cause the observed irregular wanderings. Slight wanderings may arise\r\nfrom various other sources such as movements of the rocks when\r\ngeological faults occur or the rush of a great wave due to a submarine\r\nearthquake. So far as known, however, all these other agencies cause\r\ninsignificant displacements compared with those arising from movements\r\nof the air. This fact coupled with the mathematical certainty that\r\nmeteorological phenomena must produce some wandering of the pole, has\r\ncaused most astronomers to accept Jeffreys' conclusion. If we follow\r\ntheir example we are led to conclude that changes in atmospheric\r\npressure and in the other meteorological conditions strike blows which\r\nsometimes shift the earth several feet from its normal position in\r\nrespect to the axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 13. Wandering of the pole from 1890 to 1898._\r\n(_After Moulton._)]\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing reasoning is correct, the great and especially the\r\nsudden departures from the smooth gyroscopic circle described by the\r\npole in the Eulerian motion would be expected to occur at about the same\r\ntime as unusual earthquake activity. This brings us to an interesting\r\ninquiry carried out by Milne[137] and amplified by Knott.[138] Taking\r\nAlbrecht's representation of the irregular spiral-like motion of the\r\npole, as given in Fig. 13, they show that there is a preponderance of\r\nsevere earthquakes at times when the direction of motion of the earth in\r\nreference to its axis departs from the smooth Eulerian curve. A summary\r\nof their results is given in Table 9. The table indicates that during\r\nthe period from 1892 to 1905 there were nine different times when the\r\ncurve of Fig. 13 changed its direction or was deflected by less than 10 deg.\r\nduring a tenth of a year. In other words, during those periods it did\r\nnot curve as much as it ought according to the Eulerian movement. At\r\nsuch times there were 179 world-shaking earthquakes, or an average of\r\nabout 19.9 per tenth of a year. According to the other lines of Table 9,\r\nin thirty-two cases the deflection during a tenth of a year was between\r\n10 deg. and 25 deg., while in fifty-six cases it was from 25 deg. to 40 deg.. During\r\nthese periods the curve remained close to the Eulerian path and the\r\nworld-shaking earthquakes averaged only 8.2 and 12.9. Then, when the\r\ndeflection was high, that is, when meteorological conditions threw the\r\nearth far out of its Eulerian course, the earthquakes were again\r\nnumerous, the number rising to 23.4 when the deflection amounted to more\r\nthan 55 deg..\r\n\r\nTABLE 9\r\n\r\nDEFLECTION OF PATH OF POLE COMPARED WITH EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n                   _No. of      _No. of        _Average No.\r\n    _Deflection_  Deflections_  Earthquakes_  of Earthquakes_\r\n       0-10 deg.          9          179            19.9\r\n      10-25 deg.         32          263             8.2\r\n      25-40 deg.         56          722            12.9\r\n      40-55 deg.         19          366            19.3\r\n    over 55 deg.          7          164            23.4\r\n\r\nIn order to test this conclusion in another way we have followed a\r\nsuggestion of Professor Schlesinger. Under his advice the Eulerian\r\nmotion has been eliminated and a new series of earthquake records has\r\nbeen compared with the remaining motions of the poles which presumably\r\narise largely from meteorological causes. For this purpose use has been\r\nmade of the very full records of earthquakes published under the\r\nauspices of the International Seismological Commission for the years\r\n1903 to 1908, the only years for which they are available. These include\r\nevery known shock of every description which was either recorded by\r\nseismographs or by direct observation in any part of the world. Each\r\nshock is given the same weight, no matter what its violence or how\r\nclosely it follows another. The angle of deflection has been measured as\r\nMilne measured it, but since the Eulerian motion is eliminated, our zero\r\nis approximately the normal condition which would prevail if there were\r\nno meteorological complications. Dividing the deflections into six equal\r\ngroups according to the size of the angle, we get the result shown in\r\nTable 10.\r\n\r\nTABLE 10\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES IN 1903-1908 COMPARED WITH DEPARTURES OF THE PROJECTED\r\nCURVE OF THE EARTH'S AXIS FROM THE EULERIAN POSITION\r\n\r\n    _Average angle of deflection_     _Average daily number\r\n   (_10 periods of 1/10 year each_)      of earthquakes_\r\n              -10.5 deg.                         8.31\r\n               11.5 deg.                         8.35\r\n               25.8 deg.                         8.23\r\n               40.2 deg.                         8.14\r\n               54.7 deg.                         8.86\r\n               90.3 deg.                        11.81\r\n\r\nHere where some twenty thousand earthquakes are employed the result\r\nagrees closely with that of Milne for a different series of years and\r\nfor a much smaller number of earthquakes. So long as the path of the\r\npole departs less than about 45 deg. from the smooth gyroscopic Eulerian\r\npath, the number of earthquakes is almost constant, about eight and a\r\nquarter per day. When the angle becomes large, however, the number\r\nincreases by nearly 50 per cent. Thus the work of Milne, Knott, and\r\nJeffreys is confirmed by a new investigation. Apparently earthquakes and\r\ncrustal movements are somehow related to sudden changes in the load\r\nimposed on the earth's crust by meteorological conditions.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is quite as surprising to the authors as to the\r\nreader--perhaps more so. At the beginning of this investigation we had\r\nno faith whatever in any important relation between climate and\r\nearthquakes. At its end we are inclined to believe that the relation is\r\nclose and important.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that meteorological conditions are the\r\n_cause_ of earthquakes and of movements of the earth's crust. Even\r\nthough the load that the climatic agencies can impose upon the earth's\r\ncrust runs into millions of tons per square mile, it is a trifle\r\ncompared with what the crust is able to support. There is, however, a\r\ngreat difference between the cause and the occasion of a phenomenon.\r\nSuppose that a thick sheet of glass is placed under an increasing\r\nstrain. If the strain is applied slowly enough, even so rigid a material\r\nas glass will ultimately bend rather than break. But suppose that while\r\nthe tension is high the glass is tapped. A gentle tap may be followed by\r\na tiny crack. A series of little taps may be the signal for small cracks\r\nto spread in every direction. A few slightly harder taps may cause the\r\nwhole sheet to break suddenly into many pieces. Yet even the hardest tap\r\nmay be the merest trifle compared with the strong force which is keeping\r\nthe glass in a state of strain and which would ultimately bend it if\r\ngiven time.\r\n\r\nThe earth as a whole appears to stand between steel and glass in\r\nrigidity. It is a matter of common observation that rocks stand high in\r\nthis respect and in the consequent difficulty with which they can be\r\nbent without breaking. Because of the earth's contraction the crust\r\nendures a constant strain, which must gradually become enormous. This\r\nstrain is increased by the fact that sediment is transferred from the\r\nlands to the borders of the sea and there forms areas of thick\r\naccumulation. From this has arisen the doctrine of isostasy, or of the\r\nequalization of crustal pressure. An important illustration of this is\r\nthe oceanward and equatorial creep which has been described in Chapter\r\nXI. There we saw that when the lands have once been raised to high\r\nlevels or when a shortening of the earth's axis by contraction has\r\nincreased the oceanic bulge at the equator, or when the reverse has\r\nhappened because of tidal retardation, the outer part of the earth\r\nappears to creep slowly back toward a position of perfect isostatic\r\nadjustment. If the sun had no influence upon the earth, either direct or\r\nindirect, isostasy and other terrestrial processes might flex the\r\nearth's crust so gradually that changes in the form and height of the\r\nlands would always take place slowly, even from the geological point of\r\nview. Thus erosion would usually be able to remove the rocks as rapidly\r\nas they were domed above the general level. If this happened, mountains\r\nwould be rare or unknown, and hence climatic contrasts would be far less\r\nmarked than is actually the case on our earth where crustal movements\r\nhave repeatedly been rapid enough to produce mountains.\r\n\r\nNature's methods rarely allow so gradual an adjustment to the forces of\r\nisostasy. While the crust is under a strain, not only because of\r\ncontraction, but because of changes in its load through the transference\r\nof sediments and the slow increase or decrease in the bulge at the\r\nequator, the atmosphere more or less persistently carries on the tapping\r\nprocess. The violence of that process varies greatly, and the variations\r\ndepend largely on the severity of the climatic contrasts. If the main\r\noutlines of the cyclonic hypothesis are reliable, one of the first\r\neffects of a disturbance of the sun's atmosphere is increased storminess\r\nupon the earth. This is accompanied by increased intensity in almost\r\nevery meteorological process. The most important effect, however, so far\r\nas the earth's crust is concerned would apparently be the rapid and\r\nintense changes of atmospheric pressure which would arise from the swift\r\npassage of one severe storm after another. Each storm would be a little\r\ntap on the tensely strained crust. Any single tap might be of little\r\nconsequence, even though it involved a change of a billion tons in the\r\npressure on an area no larger than the state of Rhode Island. Yet a\r\nrapid and irregular succession of such taps might possibly cause the\r\ncrust to crack, and finally to collapse in response to stresses arising\r\nfrom the shrinkage of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnother and perhaps more important effect of variations in storminess\r\nand especially in the location of the stormy areas would be an\r\nacceleration of erosion in some places and a retardation elsewhere. A\r\ngreat increase in rainfall may almost denude the slopes of soil, while a\r\ndiminution to the point where much of the vegetation dies off has a\r\nsimilar effect. If such changes should take place rapidly, great\r\nthicknesses of sediment might be concentrated in certain areas in a\r\nshort time, thus disturbing the isostatic adjustment of the earth's\r\ncrust. This might set up a state of strain which would ultimately have\r\nto be relieved, thus perhaps initiating profound crustal movements.\r\nChanges in the load of the earth's crust due to erosion and the\r\ndeposition of sediment, no matter how rapid they may be from the\r\ngeological standpoint, are slow compared with those due to changes in\r\nbarometric pressure. A drop of an inch in barometric pressure is\r\nequivalent to the removal of about five inches of solid rock. Even under\r\nthe most favorable circumstances, the removal of an average depth of\r\nfive inches of rock or its equivalent in soil over millions of square\r\nmiles would probably take several hundred years, while the removal of a\r\nsimilar load of air might occur in half a day or even a few hours. Thus\r\nthe erosion and deposition due to climatic variations presumably play\r\ntheir part in crustal deformation chiefly by producing crustal stresses,\r\nwhile the storms, as it were, strike sharp, sudden blows.\r\n\r\nSuppose now that a prolonged period of world-wide mild climate, such as\r\nis described in Chapter X, should permit an enormous accumulation of\r\nstresses due to contraction and tidal retardation. Suppose that then a\r\nsudden change of climate should produce a rapid shifting of the deep\r\nsoil that had accumulated on the lands, with a corresponding\r\nlocalization and increase in strains. Suppose also that frequent and\r\nsevere storms play their part, whether great or small, by producing an\r\nintensive tapping of the crust. In such a case the ultimate collapse\r\nwould be correspondingly great, as would be evident in the succeeding\r\ngeological epoch. The sea floor might sink lower, the continents might\r\nbe elevated, and mountain ranges might be shoved up along lines of\r\nspecial weakness. This is the story of the geological period as known to\r\nhistorical geology. The force that causes such movements would be the\r\npull of gravity upon the crust surrounding the earth's shrinking\r\ninterior. Nevertheless climatic changes might occasionally set the date\r\nwhen the gravitative pull would finally overcome inertia, and thus usher\r\nin the crustal movements that close old geologic periods and inaugurate\r\nnew ones. This, however, could occur only if the crust were under\r\nsufficient strain. As Lawson[139] says in his discussion of the \"elastic\r\nrebound theory,\" the sudden shifts of the crust which seem to be the\r\nunderlying cause of earthquakes \"can occur only after the accumulation\r\nof strain to a limit and ... this accumulation involves a slow creep of\r\nthe region affected. In the long periods between great earthquakes the\r\nenergy necessary for such shocks is being stored up in the rocks as\r\nelastic compression.\"\r\n\r\nIf a period of intense storminess should occur when the earth as a whole\r\nwas in such a state of strain, the sudden release of the strains might\r\nlead to terrestrial changes which would alter the climate still further,\r\nmaking it more extreme, and perhaps permitting the storminess due to the\r\nsolar disturbances to bring about glaciation. At the same time if\r\nvolcanic activity should increase it would add its quota to the tendency\r\ntoward glaciation. Nevertheless, it might easily happen that a very\r\nconsiderable amount of crustal movement would take place without causing\r\na continental ice sheet or even a marked alpine ice sheet. Or again, if\r\nthe strains in the earth's crust had already been largely released\r\nthrough other agencies before the stormy period began, the climate might\r\nbecome severe enough to cause glaciation in high latitudes without\r\nleading to any very marked movements of the earth's crust, as apparently\r\nhappened in the Mid-Silurian period.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: E.

The fourth\r\ncolumn gives the month in which the annual maximum occurs when the crude\r\nfigures are smoothed by the use of overlapping six-monthly means. In\r\nother words, the average for each successive six months has been placed\r\nin the middle of the period. Thus the average of January to June,\r\ninclusive, is placed between March and April, that for February to July\r\nbetween April and May, and so on. This method eliminates the minor\r\nfluctuations and also all periodicities having a duration of less than a\r\nyear. If there were no annual periodicity the smoothing would result in\r\npractically the same figure for each month. The column marked\r\n\"Amplitude\" gives the range from the highest month to the lowest divided\r\nby the number of earthquakes and then corrected according to Schuster's\r\nmethod which is well known to mathematicians, but which is so confusing\r\nto the layman that it will not be described. Next, in the column marked\r\n\"Expected Amplitude,\" we have the amplitude that would be expected if a\r\nseries of numbers corresponding to the earthquake numbers and having a\r\nsimilar range were arranged in accidental order throughout the year.\r\nThis also is calculated by Schuster's method in which the expected\r\namplitude is equal to the square root of \"pi\" divided by the number of\r\nshocks. When the actual amplitude is four or more times the expected\r\namplitude, the probability that there is a real periodicity in the\r\nobserved phenomena becomes so great that we may regard it as practically\r\ncertain. If there is no periodicity the two are equal. The last column\r\ngives the number of times by which the actual exceeds the expected\r\namplitude, and thus is a measure of the probability that earthquakes\r\nvary systematically in a period of a year.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: N.

He attributes the apparent seasonal\r\nvariation in earthquakes to the fact that in winter people are within\r\ndoors, and hence notice movements of the earth much more than in summer\r\nwhen they are out of doors. There is a similar difference between\r\npeople's habits in high latitudes and low. Undoubtedly this does have a\r\nmarked effect upon the degree to which minor earthquake shocks are\r\nnoticed. Nevertheless, de Ballore's contention, as well as any other\r\npsychological explanation, is completely upset by two facts: First,\r\ninstrumental records show the same seasonal distribution as do records\r\nbased on direct observation, and instruments certainly are not\r\ninfluenced by the seasons. Second, in some places, notably China, as\r\nDrake has shown, the summer rather than the winter is very decidedly the\r\ntime when earthquakes are most frequent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: A comparison of tropical hurricanes with earthquakes is\r\ninteresting. Taking all the hurricanes recorded in August, September,\r\nand October, from 1880 to 1899, and the corresponding earthquakes in\r\nMilne's catalogue, the correlation coefficient between hurricanes and\r\nearthquakes is +0.236, with a probable error of +-0.082, the month being\r\nused as the unit. This is not a large correlation, yet when it is\r\nremembered that the hurricanes represent only a small part of the\r\natmospheric disturbances in any given month, it suggests that with\r\nfuller data the correlation might be large.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: Ellsworth Huntington: The Geographic Work of Dr. M.

Its\r\nfundamental principle has been that the present, if rightly understood,\r\naffords a full key to the past. With this as a guide we have touched on\r\nmany hypotheses, some essential and some unessential to the general line\r\nof thought. The first main hypothesis is that the earth's present\r\nclimatic variations are correlated with changes in the solar atmosphere.\r\nThis is the keynote of the whole book. It is so well established,\r\nhowever, that it ranks as a theory rather than as an hypothesis. Next\r\ncomes the hypothesis that variations in the solar atmosphere influence\r\nthe earth's climate chiefly by causing variations not only in\r\ntemperature but also in atmospheric pressure and thus in storminess,\r\nwind, and rainfall. This, too, is one of the essential foundations on\r\nwhich the rest of the book is built, but though this cyclonic hypothesis\r\nis still a matter of discussion, it seems to be based on strong\r\nevidence. These two hypotheses might lead us astray were they not\r\nbalanced by another. This other is that many climatic conditions are due\r\nto purely terrestrial causes, such as the form and altitude of the\r\nlands, the degree to which the continents are united, the movement of\r\nocean currents, the activity of volcanoes, and the composition of the\r\natmosphere and the ocean. Only by combining the solar and the\r\nterrestrial can the truth be perceived. Finally, the last main\r\nhypothesis of this book holds that if the climatic conditions which now\r\nprevail at times of solar activity were magnified sufficiently and if\r\nthey occurred in conjunction with certain important terrestrial\r\nconditions of which there is good evidence, they would produce most of\r\nthe notable phenomena of glacial periods. For example, they would\r\nexplain such puzzling conditions as the localization and periodicity of\r\nglaciation, the formation of loess, and the occurrence of glaciation in\r\nlow latitudes during Permian and Proterozoic times. The converse of this\r\nis that if the conditions which now prevail at times when the sun is\r\nrelatively inactive should be intensified, that is, if the sun's\r\natmosphere should become calmer than now, and if the proper terrestrial\r\nconditions of topographic form and atmospheric composition should\r\nprevail, there would arise the mild climatic conditions which appear to\r\nhave prevailed during the greater part of geological time. In short,\r\nthere seems thus far to be no phase of the climate of the past which is\r\nnot in harmony with an hypothesis which combines into a single unit the\r\nthree main hypotheses of this book, solar, cyclonic, and terrestrial.\r\n\r\nOutside the main line of thought lie several other hypotheses. Several\r\nof these, as well as some of the main hypotheses, are discussed chiefly\r\nin _Earth and Sun_, but as they are given a practical application in\r\nthis book they deserve a place in this final summary. Each of these\r\nsecondary hypotheses is in its way important. Yet any or all may prove\r\nuntrue without altering our main conclusions. This point cannot be too\r\nstrongly emphasized, for there is always danger that differences of\r\nopinion as to minor hypotheses and even as to details may divert\r\nattention from the main point. Among the non-essential hypotheses is the\r\nidea that the sun's atmosphere influences that of the earth electrically\r\nas well as thermally. This idea is still so new that it has only just\r\nentered the stage of active discussion, and naturally the weight of\r\nopinion is against it. Although not necessary to the main purpose of\r\nthis book, it plays a minor role in the chapter dealing with the\r\nrelation of the sun to other astronomical bodies. It also has a vital\r\nbearing on the further advance of the science of meteorology and the art\r\nof weather forecasting. Another secondary hypothesis holds that sunspots\r\nare set in motion by the planets. Whether the effect is gravitational or\r\nmore probably electrical, or perhaps of some other sort, does not\r\nconcern us at present, although the weight of evidence seems to point\r\ntoward electronic emissions. This question, like that of the relative\r\nparts played by heat and electricity in terrestrial climatic changes,\r\ncan be set aside for the moment. What does concern us is a third\r\nhypothesis, namely, that if the planets really determine the periodicity\r\nof sunspots, even though not supplying the energy, the sun in its flight\r\nthrough space must have been repeatedly and more strongly influenced in\r\nthe same way by many other heavenly bodies. In that case, climatic\r\nchanges like those of the present, but sometimes greatly magnified, have\r\npresumably arisen because of the constantly changing position of the\r\nsolar system in respect to other parts of the universe. Finally, the\r\nfourth of our secondary hypotheses postulates that at present the date\r\nof movements of the earth's crust is often determined by the fact that\r\nstorms and other meteorological conditions keep changing the load upon\r\nfirst one part of the earth's surface and then upon another. Thus\r\nstresses that have accumulated in the earth's isostatic shell during the\r\npreceding months are released. In somewhat the same way epochs of\r\nextreme storminess and rapid erosion in the past may possibly have set\r\nthe date for great movements of the earth's crust. This hypothesis, like\r\nthe other three in our secondary or non-essential group, is still so new\r\nthat only the first steps have been taken in testing it. Yet it seems to\r\ndeserve careful study.\r\n\r\nIn testing all the hypotheses here discussed, primary and secondary\r\nalike, the first necessity is a far greater amount of quantitative work.\r\nIn this book there has been a constant attempt to subject every\r\nhypothesis to the test of statistical facts of observation.\r\nNevertheless, we have been breaking so much new ground that in many\r\ncases exact facts are not yet available, while in others they can be\r\nproperly investigated only by specialists in physics, astronomy, or\r\nmathematics. In most cases the next great step is to ascertain whether\r\nthe forces here called upon are actually great enough to produce the\r\nobserved results. Even though they act only as a means of releasing the\r\nfar greater forces due to the contraction of the earth and the sun, they\r\nneed to be rigidly tested as to their ability to play even this minor\r\nrole. Still another line of study that cries aloud for research is a\r\nfuller comparison between earthquakes on the one hand and meteorological\r\nconditions and the wandering of the poles on the other. Finally, an\r\nextremely interesting and hopeful quest is the determination of the\r\npositions and movements of additional stars and other celestial bodies,\r\nthe faint and invisible as well as the bright, in order to ascertain the\r\nprobable magnitude of their influence upon the sun and thus upon the\r\nearth at various times in the past and in the future. Perhaps we are\r\neven now approaching some star that will some day give rise to a period\r\nof climatic stress like that of the fourteenth century, or possibly to a\r\nglacial epoch. Or perhaps the variations in others of the nearer stars\r\nas well as Alpha Centauri may show a close relation to changes in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThroughout this volume we have endeavored to discover new truth\r\nconcerning the physical environment that has molded the evolution of all\r\nlife. We have seen how delicate is the balance among the forces of\r\nnature, even though they be of the most stupendous magnitude. We have\r\nseen that a disturbance of this balance in one of the heavenly bodies\r\nmay lead to profound changes in another far away. Yet during the billion\r\nyears, more or less, of which we have knowledge, there appears never to\r\nhave been a complete cataclysm involving the destruction of all life.\r\nOne star after another, if our hypothesis is correct, has approached the\r\nsolar system closely enough to set the atmosphere of the sun in such\r\ncommotion that great changes of climate have occurred upon the earth.\r\nYet never has the solar system passed so close to any other body or\r\nchanged in any other way sufficiently to blot out all living things. The\r\neffect of climatic changes has always been to alter the environment and\r\ntherefore to destroy part of the life of a given time, but with this\r\nthere has invariably gone a stimulus to other organic types. New\r\nadaptations have occurred, new lines of evolutionary progress have been\r\ninitiated, and the net result has been greater organic diversity and\r\nrichness. Temporarily a great change of climate may seem to retard\r\nevolution, but only for a moment as the geologist counts time. Then it\r\nbecomes evident that the march of progress has actually been more rapid\r\nthan usual. Thus the main periods of climatic stress are the most\r\nconspicuous milestones upon the upward path toward more varied\r\nadaptation. The end of each such period of stress has found the life of\r\nthe world nearer to the high mentality which reaches out to the utmost\r\nlimits of space, of time, and of thought in the search for some\r\nexplanation of the meaning of the universe. Each approach of the sun to\r\nother bodies, if such be the cause of the major climatic changes, has\r\nbrought the organic world one step nearer to the solution of the\r\ngreatest of all problems,--the problem of whether there is a psychic\r\ngoal beyond the mental goal toward which we are moving with ever\r\naccelerating speed. Throughout the vast eons of geological time the\r\nadjustment of force to force, of one body of matter to another, and of\r\nthe physical environment to the organic response has been so delicate,\r\nand has tended so steadily toward the one main line of mental progress\r\nthat there seems to be a purpose in it all. If the cosmic uniformity of\r\nclimate continues to prevail and if the uniformity is varied by changes\r\nas stimulating as those of the past, the imagination can scarcely\r\npicture the wonders of the future. In the course of millions or even\r\nbillions of years the development of mind, and perhaps of soul, may\r\nexcel that of today as far as the highest known type of mentality excels\r\nthe primitive plasma from which all life appears to have arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n* Indicates illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbot, C.
