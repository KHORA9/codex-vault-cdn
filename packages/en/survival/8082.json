POWELL, PH.D., LL.D.,\r\n\r\nFormerly Director of the United States Geological Survey. Member of the\r\nNational Academy of Sciences, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWITH MANY ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nFirst published 1895\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nOn my return from the first exploration of the canyons of the Colorado,\r\nI found that our journey had been the theme of much newspaper writing. A\r\nstory of disaster had been circulated, with many particulars of hardship\r\nand tragedy, so that it was currently believed throughout the United\r\nStates that all the members of the party were lost save one. A good\r\nfriend of mine had gathered a great number of obituary notices, and it\r\nwas interesting and rather flattering to me to discover the high esteem\r\nin which I had been held by the people of the United States. In my\r\nsupposed death I had attained to a glory which I fear my continued life\r\nhas not fully vindicated.\r\n\r\nThe exploration was not made for adventure, but purely for scientific\r\npurposes, geographic and geologic, and I had no intention of writing an\r\naccount of it, but only of recording the scientific results. Immediately\r\non my return I was interviewed a number of times, and these interviews\r\nwere published in the daily press; and here I supposed all interest in\r\nthe exploration ended. But in 1874 the editors of Scribner's Monthly\r\nrequested me to publish a popular account of the Colorado exploration in\r\nthat journal. To this I acceded and prepared four short articles, which\r\nwere elaborately illustrated from photographs in my possession.\r\n\r\nIn the same year--1874--at the instance of Professor Henry of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, I was called before an appropriations committee\r\nof the House of Representatives to explain certain estimates made by\r\nthe Professor for funds to continue scientific work which had been in\r\nprogress from the date of the original exploration. Mr. Garfield was\r\nchairman of the committee, and after listening to my\r\n\r\nIV PREFACE.\r\n\r\naccount of the progress of the geographic and geologic work, he asked\r\nme why no history of the original exploration of the canyons had been\r\npublished. I informed him that I had no interest in that work as an\r\nadventure, but was interested only in the scientific results, and that\r\nthese results had in part been published and in part were in course of\r\npublication. Thereupon Mr. Garfield, in a pleasant manner, insisted that\r\nthe history of the exploration should be published by the government,\r\nand that I must understand that my scientific work would be continued by\r\nadditional appropriations only upon my promise that I would publish\r\nan account of the exploration. I made the promise, and the task was\r\nimmediately undertaken.\r\n\r\nMy daily journal had been kept on long and narrow strips of brown paper,\r\nwhich were gathered into little volumes that were bound in sole leather\r\nin camp as they were completed. After some deliberation I decided to\r\npublish this journal, with only such emendations and corrections as\r\nits hasty writing in camp necessitated. It chanced that the journal\r\nwas written in the present tense, so that the first account of my trip\r\nappeared in that tense. The journal thus published was not a lengthy\r\npaper, constituting but a part of a report entitled \"Exploration of the\r\nColorado River of the West and its Tributaries. Explored in 1869, 1870,\r\n1871, and 1872, under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution.\" The other papers published with it relate to the\r\ngeography, geology, and natural history of the country. And here again I\r\nsupposed all account of the exploration ended. But from that time until\r\nthe present I have received many letters urging that a popular account\r\nof the exploration and a description of that wonderful land should be\r\npublished by me. This call has been voiced occasionally in the daily\r\npress and sometimes in the magazines, until at last I have concluded to\r\npublish a fuller account in popular form. In doing this I have revised\r\nand enlarged the original journal of exploration, and have added several\r\nnew chapters descriptive of the region and of the people who inhabit it.\r\nRealizing the difficulty of painting in word colors a land so strange,\r\nso wonderful, and so vast in its features, in the weakness of my\r\ndescriptive powers I have sought refuge in graphic illustration, and for\r\nthis purpose have gathered from the magazines and from various scien-\r\n\r\nPREFACE. V\r\n\r\ntific reports an abundance of material. All of this illustrative\r\nmaterial originated in my work, but it has already been used elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMany years have passed since the exploration, and those who were boys\r\nwith me in the enterprise are--ah, most of them are dead, and the living\r\nare gray with age. Their bronzed, hardy, brave faces come before me as\r\nthey appeared in the vigor of life; their lithe but powerful forms seem\r\nto move around me; and the memory of the men and their heroic deeds, the\r\nmen and their generous acts, overwhelms me with a joy that seems almost\r\na grief, for it starts a fountain of tears. I was a maimed man; my right\r\narm was gone; and these brave men, these good men, never forgot it. In\r\nevery danger my safety was their first care, and in every waking hour\r\nsome kind service was rendered me, and they transfigured my misfortune\r\ninto a boon.\r\n\r\nTo you--J. C. Sumner, William H. Dunn, W. H. Powell, G. Y. Bradley, O.\r\nG. Howland, Seneca Howland, Frank Goodman, W. E. Hawkins, and Andrew\r\nHall--my noble and generous companions, dead and alive, I dedicate this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER PAGE\r\n\r\nI.

A group of little alpine lakes, that receive\r\ntheir waters directly from perpetual snowbanks, discharge into a common\r\nreservoir known as Grand Lake, a beautiful sheet of water. Its quiet\r\nsurface reflects towering cliffs and crags of granite on its eastern\r\nshore, and stately pines and firs stand on its western margin.\r\n\r\nThe Green River heads near Fremont's Peak, in the Wind River Mountains.\r\nThis river, like the Grand, has its sources in alpine lakes fed by\r\neverlasting snows. Thousands of these little lakes, with deep, cold,\r\nemerald waters, are embosomed among the crags of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nThese streams, born in the cold, gloomy solitudes of the upper mountain\r\nregion, have a strange, eventful history as they pass down through\r\ngorges, tumbling in cascades and cataracts, until they reach the hot,\r\narid plains of the Lower Colorado, where the waters that were so clear\r\nabove empty as turbid floods into the Gulf of California.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Colorado is in latitude 31 degrees 53 minutes and\r\nlongitude 115 degrees. The source of the Grand River is in latitude 40\r\ndegrees 17' and longitude 105 degrees 43' approximately. The source of\r\nthe Green River is in latitude 43 degrees 15' and longitude 109 degrees\r\n54' approximately.\r\n\r\nThe Green River is larger than the Grand and is the upper continuation\r\nof the Colorado. Including this river, the whole length of\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO. powell-canyons-2.jpg\r\n\r\nPA-RÚ-NU-WEAP CANYON.\r\n\r\nthe stream is about 2,000 miles. The region of country drained by the\r\nColorado and its tributaries is about 800 miles in length and varies\r\nfrom 300 to 500 miles in width, containing about 300,000 square miles,\r\nan area larger than all the New England and Middle States with Maryland,\r\nVirginia and West Virginia added, or nearly as large as Minnesota,\r\nWisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri combined.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct portions of the basin of the Colorado, a desert\r\nportion below and a plateau portion above. The lower third, or desert\r\nportion of the basin, is but little above the level of the sea, though\r\nhere and there ranges of moun-\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\ntains rise to an altitude of from 2,000 to 6,000 feet. This part of the\r\nvalley is bounded on the northeast by a line of cliffs, which present\r\na bold, often vertical step, hundreds or thousands of feet to the\r\ntable-lands above. On the California side a vast desert stretches\r\nwestward, past the head of the Gulf of California, nearly to the shore\r\nof the Pacific. Between the desert and the sea a narrow belt of valley,\r\nhill, and mountain of wonderful beauty is found. Over this coastal zone\r\nthere falls a balm distilled from the great ocean, as gentle showers and\r\nrefreshing dews bathe the land. When rains come the emerald hills laugh\r\nwith delight as bourgeoning bloom is spread in the sunlight. When the\r\nrains have ceased all the verdure turns to gold.

North of the Gulf of\r\nCalifornia the desert is known as \"Coahuila Valley,\" the most desolate\r\nregion on the continent. At one time in the geologic history of this\r\ncountry the Gulf of California extended a long distance farther to the\r\nnorthwest, above the point where the Colorado River now enters it; but\r\nthis stream brought its mud from the mountains and the hills above and\r\npoured it into the gulf and gradually erected a vast dam across it,\r\nuntil the waters above were separated from the waters below; then the\r\nColorado cut a channel into the lower gulf. The upper waters, being cut\r\noff from the sea, gradually evaporated, and what is known as Coahuila\r\nValley was the bottom of this ancient upper gulf,\r\n\r\n20 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nand thus the land is now below the level of the sea. Between Coahuila\r\nValley and the river there are many low, ashen-gray mountains standing\r\nin short ranges. The rainfall is so little that no perennial streams are\r\nformed. When a great rain comes it washes the mountain sides and gathers\r\non its way a deluge of sand, which it spreads over the plain below, for\r\nthe streams do not carry the sediment to the sea. So the mountains are\r\nwashed down and the valleys are filled. On the Arizona side of the river\r\ndesert plains are interrupted by desert mountains. Far to the eastward\r\nthe country rises until the Sierra Madre are reached in New Mexico,\r\nwhere these mountains divide the waters of the Colorado from the Rio\r\nGrande del Norte. Here in New Mexico the Gila River has its source. Some\r\nof its tributaries rise in the mountains to the south, in the territory\r\nbelonging to the republic of Mexico, but the Gila gathers the greater\r\npart of its waters from a great plateau on the northeast. Its sources\r\nare everywhere in pine-clad mountains and plateaus, but all of the\r\naffluents quickly descend into the desert valley below, through which\r\nthe Gila winds its way westward to the Colorado. In times of continued\r\ndrought the bed of the Gila is dry, but the region is subject to great\r\nand violent storms, and floods roll down from the heights with marvelous\r\nprecipitation, carrying devastation on their way. Where the Colorado\r\nRiver forms the boundary between California and Arizona it cuts through\r\na number of volcanic rocks by black, yawning canyons. Between these\r\ncanyons the river has a low but rather narrow flood plain, with\r\ncottonwood groves scattered here and there, and a chaparral of mesquite\r\nbearing beans and thorns. Four hundred miles above its mouth and\r\nmore than two hundred miles above the Gila, the Colorado has a second\r\ntributary--\"Bill Williams' River\" it is called by excessive courtesy. It\r\nis but a muddy creek. Two hundred miles above this the Rio Virgen joins\r\nthe Colorado. This river heads in the Markagunt Plateau and the Pine\r\nValley Mountains of Utah. Its sources are 7,000 or 8,000 feet above the\r\nsea, but from the beautiful course of the upper region it soon drops\r\ninto a great sandy valley below and becomes a river of flowing sand.\r\nAt ordinary stages it is very wide but very shallow, rippling over\r\nthe quicksands in tawny waves. On its way it cuts through the Beaver\r\nMountains by a weird canyon. On either side grease-wood plains stretch\r\nfar away, interrupted here and there by bad-land hills.\r\n\r\n21 powell-canyons-4.jpg\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO PEAK.\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nThe region of country lying on either side of the Colorado for six\r\nhundred miles of its course above the gulf, stretching to Coahuila\r\nValley below on the west and to the highlands where the Gila heads on\r\nthe east, is one of singular characteristics. The plains and valleys are\r\nlow, arid, hot, and naked, and the volcanic mountains scattered here and\r\nthere are lone and desolate. During the long months the sun pours its\r\nheat upon the rocks and sands, untempered by clouds above or forest\r\nshades beneath. The springs are so few in number that their names\r\nare household words in every Indian rancheria and every 23\r\npowell-canyons-5.jpg\r\n\r\nCLIFF NEAR FORT WINGATE.\r\n\r\nsettler's home; and there are no brooks, no creeks, and no rivers but\r\nthe trunk of the Colorado and the trunk of the Gila. The few plants are\r\nstrangers to the dwellers in the temperate zone. On the mountains a few\r\njunipers and piñons are found, and cactuses, agave, and yuccas, low,\r\nfleshy plants with bayonets and thorns. The landscape of vegetal life is\r\nweird--no forests, no meadows, no green hills, no foliage, but clublike\r\nstems of plants armed with stilettos. Many of the plants bear\r\ngorgeous flowers. The birds are few, but often of rich plumage. Hooded\r\nrattlesnakes, horned toads, and lizards crawl in the dust and among the\r\nrocks. One of these lizards, the \"Gila monster,\" is\r\n\r\n23 powell-canyons-6.jpg\r\n\r\nSCENERY ON THE HIGH PLATEAUS.\r\n\r\n24 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\npoisonous. Rarely antelopes are seen, but wolves, rabbits, and sundry\r\nground squirrels abound.\r\n\r\nThe desert valley of the Colorado, which has been described as distinct\r\nfrom the plateau region above, is the home of many Indian tribes. Away\r\nup at the sources of the Gila, where the pines and cedars stand and\r\nwhere creeks and valleys are found, is a part of the Apache land. These\r\ntribes extend far south into the republic of Mexico. The Apaches are\r\nintruders in this country, having at some time, perhaps many centuries\r\nago, migrated from British America. They speak an Athapascan language.\r\nThe Apaches and Navajos are the American Bedouins. On their way from\r\nthe far North they left several colonies in Washington, Oregon, and\r\nCalifornia. They came to the country on foot, but since the Spanish\r\ninvasion they have become skilled horsemen. They are wily warriors\r\nand implacable enemies, feared by all other tribes. They are hunters,\r\nwarriors, and priests, these professions not yet being differentiated.\r\nThe cliffs of the region have many caves, in which these people perform\r\ntheir religious rites. The Sierra Madre formerly supported abundant\r\ngame, and the little Sonora deer was common. Bears and mountain lions\r\nwere once found in great numbers, and they put the courage and prowess\r\nof the Apaches to a severe test. Huge rattlesnakes are common, and the\r\nrattlesnake god is one of the deities of the tribes.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Gila and on its tributaries from the northeast\r\nare the Pimas, Maricopas, and Papagos. They are skilled agriculturists,\r\ncultivating lands by irrigation. In the same region many ruined villages\r\nare found. The dwellings of these towns in the valley were built chiefly\r\nof grout, and the fragments of the ancient pueblos still remaining have\r\nstood through centuries of storm. Other pueblos near the cliffs on the\r\nnortheast were built of stone. The people who occupied them cultivated\r\nthe soil by irrigation, and their hydraulic works were on an extensive\r\nscale. They built canals scores of miles in length and built reservoirs\r\nto store water. They were skilled workers in pottery. From the fibers\r\nof some of the desert plants they made fabrics with which to clothe\r\nthemselves, and they cultivated cotton. They were deft artists in\r\npicture-writings, which they etched on the rocks. Many interesting\r\nvestiges of their ancient art remain, testifying to their skill as\r\nsavage\r\n\r\n25 powell-canyons-7.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE MOGOLLON ESCARPMENT.\r\n\r\n26 powell-canyons-8.jpg\r\n\r\nSNOW-CLAD MOUNTAINS ON THE RIVER.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE COLORADO. 27\r\n\r\nartisans. It seems probable that the Pimas, Maricopas, and Papagos are\r\nthe same people who built the pueblos and constructed the irrigation\r\nworks; so their traditions state. It is also handed down that the\r\npueblos were destroyed in wars with the Apaches. In these groves of the\r\nflood plain of the Colorado the Mojave and Yuma Indians once had their\r\nhomes. They caught fish from the river and snared a few rabbits in the\r\ndesert, but lived mainly on mesquite beans, the hearts of yucca plants,\r\nand the fruits of the cactus. They also gathered a harvest from the\r\nriver reeds. To some slight extent they cultivated the soil by rude\r\nirrigation and raised corn and squashes. They lived almost naked, for\r\nthe climate is warm and dry. Sometimes a year passes without a drop of\r\nrain. Still farther to the north the Chemehuevas lived, partly along the\r\nriver and partly in the mountains to the west, where a few springs are\r\nfound. They belong to the great Shoshonian family. On the Rio Virgen and\r\nin the mountains round about, a confederacy of tribes speaking the Ute\r\nlanguage and belonging to the Shoshonian family have their homes.\r\nThese people built their sheltering homes of boughs and the bast of\r\nthe juniper. In such shelters, they lived in winter, but in summer they\r\nerected extensive booths of poles and willows, sometimes large enough\r\nfor the accommodation of a tribe of 100 or 200 persons. A wide gap\r\nin culture separates the Pimas, Maricopas, and Papagos from the\r\nChemehuevas. The first were among the most advanced tribes found in\r\nthe United States; the last were among the very lowest; they are the\r\noriginal \"Digger\" Indians, called so by all the other tribes, but the\r\nname has gradually spread beyond its original denotation to many tribes\r\nof Utah, Nevada, and California.\r\n\r\nThe low desert, with its desolate mountains, which has thus been\r\ndescribed is plainly separated from the upper region of plateau by the\r\nMogollon Escarpment, which, beginning in the Sierra Madre of New Mexico,\r\nextends northwestward across the Colorado far into Utah, where it ends\r\non the margin of the Great Basin. The rise by this escarpment varies\r\nfrom 3,000 to more than 4,000 feet. The step from the lowlands to the\r\nhighlands which is here called the Mogollon Escarpment is not a simple\r\nline of cliffs, but is a complicated and irregular facade presented\r\nto the southwest. Its different portions have been named by the people\r\nliving below as distinct mountains, as Shiwits Mountains, Mogollon\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nMountains, Piñal Mountains, Sierra Calitro, etc., but they all rise to\r\nthe summit of the same great plateau region.\r\n\r\nThe upper region, extending to the headwaters of the Grand and Green\r\nRivers, constitutes the great Plateau Province. These plateaus are\r\ndrained by the Colorado River and its tributaries; the eastern and\r\npowell-canyons-9.jpg\r\n\r\nOUR MESSENGER.\r\n\r\nsouthern margin by the Rio Grande and its tributaries, and the western\r\nby streams that flow into the Great Basin and are lost in the Great Salt\r\nLake and other bodies of water that have no drainage to the sea. The\r\ngeneral surface of this upper region is from 5,000 to 8,000 feet above\r\nsea level, though the channels of the streams are cut much lower.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE COLORADO. 29\r\n\r\nThis high region, on the east, north, and west, is set with ranges of\r\nsnow-clad mountains attaining an altitude above the sea varying from\r\n8,000 to 14,000 feet. All winter long snow falls on its mountain-crested\r\nrim, filling the gorges, half burying the forests, and covering the\r\ncrags and peaks with a mantle woven by the winds from the waves of the\r\nsea. When the summer sun comes this snow melts and tumbles down the\r\nmountain sides in millions of cascades. A million cascade brooks unite\r\nto form a thousand torrent creeks; a thousand torrent creeks unite to\r\nform half a hundred rivers beset with cataracts; half a hundred roaring\r\nrivers unite to form the Colorado, which rolls, a mad, turbid stream,\r\ninto the Gulf of California.\r\n\r\nConsider the action of one of these streams. Its source is in the\r\nmountains, where the snows fall; its course, through the arid plains.\r\nNow, if at the river's flood storms were falling on the plains, its\r\nchannel would be cut but little faster than the adjacent country would\r\nbe washed, and the general level would thus be preserved; but under the\r\nconditions here mentioned, the river. continually deepens its beds;\r\nso all the streams cut deeper and still deeper, until their banks are\r\ntowering cliffs of solid rock. These deep, narrow gorges are called\r\ncanyons.\r\n\r\nFor more than a thousand miles along its course the Colorado has cut for\r\nitself such a canyon; but at some few points where lateral streams join\r\nit the canyon is broken, and these narrow, transverse valleys divide it\r\ninto a series of canyons.\r\n\r\nThe Virgen, Kanab, Paria, Escalante, Fremont, San Rafael, Price, and\r\nUinta on the west, the Grand, White, Yampa, San Juan, and Colorado\r\nChiquito on the east, have also cut for themselves such narrow winding\r\ngorges, or deep canyons. Every river entering these has cut another\r\ncanyon; every lateral creek has cut a canyon; every brook runs in a\r\ncanyon; every rill born of a shower and born again of a shower and\r\nliving only during these showers has cut for itself a canyon; so that\r\npowell-canyons-10.jpg\r\n\r\nAPACHE BASKET\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthe whole upper portion of the basin of the Colorado is traversed by a\r\nlabyrinth of these deep gorges.\r\n\r\nOwing to a great variety of geological conditions, these canyons differ\r\nmuch in general aspect. The Rio Virgen, between Long Valley and the\r\nMormon town of Rockville, runs through Parunuweap Can-\r\n\r\n31 powell-canyons-11.jpg\r\n\r\nOUR MESSENGER'S WIFE.\r\n\r\nyon, which is often not more than 20 or 30 feet in width and is from 600\r\nto 1,500 feet deep. Away to the north the Yampa empties into the Green\r\nby a canyon that I essayed to cross in the fall of 1868, but was baffled\r\nfrom day to day, and the fourth day had nearly passed before I could\r\nfind my way down to the river. But thirty miles above its mouth this\r\ncanyon ends, and a narrow valley with a flood plain\r\n\r\n31 powell-canyons-12.jpg\r\n\r\nRUINS OF TOYALONE.\r\n\r\n32 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nis found. Still farther up the stream the river comes down through\r\nanother canyon, and beyond that a narrow valley is found, and its upper\r\ncourse is now through a canyon and now through a valley. All these\r\ncanyons are alike changeable in their topographic characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe longest canyon through which the Colorado runs is that between the\r\nmouth of the Colorado Chiquito and the Grand Wash, a distance of 217 1/2\r\nmiles. But this is separated from another above, 65 1/2 miles in length,\r\nonly by the narrow canyon valley of the Colorado Chiquito.\r\n\r\nAll the scenic features of this canyon land are on a giant scale,\r\nstrange and weird. The streams run at depths almost inaccessible,\r\nlashing the rocks which beset their channels, rolling in rapids and\r\nplunging in falls, and making a wild music which but adds to the gloom\r\nof the solitude. The little valleys nestling along the streams are\r\ndiversified by bordering willows, clumps of box elder, and small groves\r\nof cottonwood.\r\n\r\nLow mesas, dry, treeless, stretch back from the brink of the canyon,\r\noften showing smooth surfaces of naked, solid rock. In some places the\r\ncountry rock is composed of marls, and here the surface is a bed of\r\nloose, disintegrated material through which one walks as in a bed of\r\nashes. Often these marls are richly colored and variegated. In other\r\nplaces the country rock is a loose sandstone, the disintegration of\r\nwhich has left broad stretches of drifting sand, white, golden, and\r\nvermilion. Where this sandstone is a conglomerate, a paving of pebbles\r\nhas been left,--a mosaic of many colors, polished by the drifting sands\r\nand glistening in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nAfter the canyons, the most remarkable features of the country are the\r\nlong lines of cliffs. These are bold escarpments scores or hundreds of\r\nmiles in length,--great geographic steps, often hundreds or thousands of\r\nfeet in altitude, presenting steep faces of rock, often vertical. Having\r\nclimbed one of these steps, you may descend by a gentle, sometimes\r\nimperceptible, slope to the foot of another. They thus present a series\r\nof terraces, the steps of which are well-defined escarpments of\r\nrock. The lateral extension of such a line of cliffs is usually very\r\nirregular; sharp salients are projected on the plains below, and deep\r\nrecesses are cut into the terraces above. Intermittent streams coming\r\n\r\n33 powell-canyons-13.jpg\r\n\r\nA ZUÑI COURT.\r\n\r\n34 powell-canyons-14.jpg\r\n\r\nADOBE CHURCH--ZUÑI.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE COLORADO. 35\r\n\r\ndown the cliffs have cut many canyons or canyon valleys, by which the\r\ntraveler may pass from the plain below to the terrace above. By these\r\ngigantic stairways he may ascend to high plateaus, covered with forests\r\nof pine and fir.\r\n\r\nThe region is further diversified by short ranges of eruptive mountains.\r\nA vast system of fissures--huge cracks in the rocks to the depths\r\nbelow--extends across the country. From these crevices floods of lava\r\nhave poured, covering mesas and table-lands with sheets of black basalt.\r\nThe expiring energies of these volcanic agencies have piled up huge\r\ncinder cones that stand along the fissures, red, brown, and black, naked\r\nof vegetation, and conspicuous landmarks, set as they are in contrast to\r\nthe bright, variegated rocks of sedimentary origin.\r\n\r\n36 These canyon gorges, obstructing cliffs, and desert wastes have\r\nprevented the traveler from penetrating the country, so that until the\r\nColorado River Exploring Expedition was organized it was almost unknown.\r\nIn the early history of the country Spanish adventurers penetrated the\r\nregion and told marvelous stories of its wonders. It was also traversed\r\nby priests who sought to convert the Indian tribes to Christianity. In\r\nlater days, since the region has been under the control of the United\r\nStates, various government expeditions have penetrated the land. Yet\r\nenough had been seen in the earlier days to foment rumor, and many\r\nwonderful stories were told in the hunter's cabin and the prospector's\r\ncamp--stories of parties entering the gorge in boats and being carried\r\ndown with fearful velocity into whirlpools where all were overwhelmed in\r\nthe abyss of waters, and stories of underground passages for the\r\ngreat river into which boats had passed never to be seen again. It was\r\ncurrently believed that the river was lost under the rocks for several\r\nhundred miles. There were other accounts of great falls whose roaring\r\nmusic could be heard on the distant mountain summits; and there were\r\nstories current of parties wandering on the brink of the canyon and\r\nvainly endeavoring to reach the waters below, and perishing with thirst\r\nat last in sight of the river which was roaring its mockery into their\r\ndying ears.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, too, have woven the mysteries of the canyons into the myths\r\nof their religion. Long ago there was a great and wise chief who mourned\r\nthe death of his wife and would not be comforted,\r\n\r\n36 powell-canyons-15.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE SITE OF MOENKOPI.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\n37\r\n\r\nuntil Tavwoats, one of the Indian gods, came to him and told him his\r\nwife was in a happier land, and offered to take him there that he might\r\nsee for himself, if, upon his return, he would cease to mourn. The great\r\nchief promised. Then Tavwoats made a trail through the mountains that\r\nintervene between that beautiful land, the balmy region of the great\r\nwest, and this, the desert home of the poor Numa. This trail was the\r\ncanyon gorge of the Colorado. Through it he led him; and when they had\r\nreturned the deity exacted from the chief a promise that he would tell\r\nno one of the trail. Then he rolled a river into the gorge, a mad,\r\nraging stream, that should engulf any that might attempt to enter\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\n38 powell-canyons-16.jpg\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN OF THE HOLY CROSS.\r\n\r\n39\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES.\r\n\r\nFROM the Grand Canyon of the Colorado a great plateau extends\r\nsoutheastward through Arizona nearly to the line of New Mexico, where\r\nthis elevated land merges into the Sierra Madre. The general surface of\r\nthis plateau is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nIt is sharply defined from the lowlands of Arizona by the Mogollon\r\nEscarpment. On the northeast it gradually falls off into the valley\r\nof the Little Colorado, and on the north it terminates abruptly in the\r\nGrand Canyon.\r\n\r\nVarious tributaries of the Gila have their sources in this escarpment,\r\nand before entering the desolate valley below they run in beautiful\r\ncanyons which they have carved for themselves in the margin of the\r\nplateau. Sometimes these canyons are in the sandstones and limestones\r\nwhich constitute the platform of the great elevated region called the\r\nSan Francisco Plateau. The escarpment is caused by a fault, the great\r\nblock of the upper side being lifted several thousand feet above the\r\nvalley region. Through the fissure lavas poured out, and in many places\r\nthe escarpment is concealed by sheets of lava. The canyons in these lava\r\nbeds are often of great interest.\r\n\r\nOn the plateau a number of volcanic mountains are found, and black\r\ncinder cones are scattered in profusion. Through the forest lands are\r\nmany beautiful prairies and glades that in midsummer are decked with\r\ngorgeous wild flowers. The rains of the region give source to few\r\nperennial streams, but intermittent streams have carved deep gorges in\r\nthe plateau, so that it is divided into many blocks. The upper surface,\r\nalthough forest-clad and covered with beautiful grasses, is almost\r\ndestitute of water. A few springs are found, but they are far apart, and\r\nsome of the volcanic craters hold lakelets. The limestone and basaltic\r\nrocks sometimes hold pools of water; and where the basins\r\n\r\n40 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nare deep the waters are perennial. Such pools are known as \"water\r\npockets.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the great timber region of Arizona. Not many years ago it was a\r\nvast park for elk, deer, and antelope, and bears and mountain lions\r\nwere abundant. This is the last home of the wild turkey in the\r\npowell-canyons-17.jpg\r\n\r\nWINGATE CLIFF.\r\n\r\nUnited States, for they are still found here in great numbers. San\r\nFrancisco Peak is the highest of these volcanic mountains, and about\r\nit are grouped in an irregular way many volcanic cones, one of which\r\npresents some remarkable characteristics. A portion of the cone is of\r\nbright reddish cinders, while the adjacent rocks are of black basalt.\r\nThe contrast in the colors is so great that on viewing the mountain from\r\na distance the red cinders seem to be on fire. From this circumstance\r\nthe cone has been named Sunset Peak. When distant from it ten or twenty\r\nmiles it is hard to believe that the effect is produced by contrasting\r\ncolors, for the peak seems to glow with a light of its own.\r\n\r\nIn centuries past the San Francisco Plateau was the home of\r\npueblo-building tribes, and the ruins of their habitations are widely\r\nscattered over this elevated region. Thousands of little dwellings\r\nare found, usually built of blocks of basalt. In some cases they were\r\nclustered in little towns, and three of these deserve further mention.\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES.\r\n\r\n41\r\n\r\nA few miles south of San Francisco Peak there is an intermittent stream\r\nknown as Walnut Creek. This stream runs in a deep gorge 600 to 800\r\nfeet below the general surface. The stream has cut its way through the\r\nlimestone and through series of sandstones, and bold walls of rock are\r\npresented on either side. In some places the softer sandstones lying\r\nbetween the harder limestones and sandstones have yielded to weathering\r\nagencies, so that there are caves running along the face of the wall,\r\nsometimes for hundreds or thousands of feet, but not very deep. These\r\nnatural shelves in the rock were utilized by an ancient tribe of Indians\r\nfor their homes. They built stairways to the waters below and to the\r\nhunting grounds above, and lived in the caves. They walled the fronts of\r\nthe caves with rock, which they covered with plaster, and divided them\r\ninto compartments or rooms; and now many hundreds of these dwellings are\r\nfound. Such is the cliff village of powell-canyons-18.jpg\r\n\r\nPYRAMID BUTTE NEAR FORT WINGATE.\r\n\r\nWalnut Canyon. In the ruins of these cliff houses mortars and pestles\r\nare found in great profusion, and when first discovered many articles of\r\npottery were found, and still many potsherds are seen. The people were\r\n\r\n42\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nvery skillful in the manufacture of stone implements, especially spears,\r\nknives, and arrows.\r\n\r\nEast of San Francisco Peak there is another low volcanic cone, composed\r\nof ashes which have been slightly cemented by the processes of time,\r\nbut which can be worked with great ease. On this cone another tribe of\r\nIndians made its village, and for the purpose they sunk shafts into the\r\neasily worked but partially consolidated ashes, and after penetrating\r\nfrom the surface three or four feet they enlarged the chambers so as to\r\nmake them ten or twelve feet in diameter. In such a chamber they made\r\na little fireplace, its chimney running up on one side of the\r\npowell-canyons-19.jpg\r\n\r\nZUÑI CLIFFS.\r\n\r\nwellhole by which the chamber was entered. Often they excavated smaller\r\nchambers connected with the larger, so that sometimes two, three, four,\r\nor even five smaller connecting chambers are grouped about a large\r\ncentral room. The arts of these people resembled those of the people who\r\ndwelt in Walnut Canyon. One thing more is worthy of special notice. On\r\nthe very top of the cone they cleared off a space for a courtyard, or\r\nassembly square, and about it they erected booths, and\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES.\r\n\r\n43\r\n\r\nwithin the square a space of ground was prepared with a smooth floor, on\r\nwhich they performed the ceremonies of their religion and danced to the\r\ngods in prayer and praise.\r\n\r\nSome twelve or fifteen miles farther east, in another volcanic cone,\r\na rough crater is found, surrounded by piles of cinders and angular\r\npowell-canyons-20.jpg\r\n\r\nGREAT NECK NINE MILES SOUTH OF SALAZAR.\r\n\r\nfragments of lava. In the walls of this crater many caves are found,\r\nand here again a village was established, the caves in the scoria being\r\nutilized as habitations of men. These little caves were fashioned into\r\nrooms of more symmetry and convenience than originally found, and the\r\nopenings to the caves were walled. Nor did these people neglect the\r\ngods, for in this crater town, as in the cinder-cone town, a place of\r\nworship was prepared.\r\n\r\nMany other caves opening into the canyon and craters of this plateau\r\nwere utilized in like manner as homes for tribal people, and in one cave\r\nfar to the south a fine collection of several hundred pieces of pottery\r\nhas been made.\r\n\r\n44\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nOn the northeast of the San Francisco Plateau is the valley of the\r\nLittle Colorado, a tributary of the Colorado River. This river is formed\r\nby streams that head chiefly on the San Francisco Plateau, but in\r\npart on the Zuñi Plateau. The Little Colorado is a marvelous river.\r\nIn seasons of great rains it is a broad but shallow torrent of mud; in\r\nseasons of drought it dwindles and sometimes entirely disappears along\r\nportions of its course. The upper tributaries usually run in beautiful\r\nbox canyons. Then the river flows through a low, desolate, bad-land\r\nvalley, and the river of mud is broad but shallow, except in seasons of\r\ngreat floods. But fifty miles or more above the junction of this\r\nstream with the Colorado River proper, it plunges into a canyon\r\npowell-canyons-21.jpg\r\n\r\nCINDER CONE AND NECK NORTHEAST OF GRANT STATION.\r\n\r\nwith limestone walls, and steadily this canyon increases in depth, until\r\nat the mouth of the stream it has walls more than 4,000 feet in height.\r\nThe contrast between this canyon portion and the upper\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES.\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\nvalley portion is very great. Above, the river ripples in a broad sheet\r\nof mud; below, it plunges with violence over great cataracts and\r\nrapids. Above, the bad lands stretch on either hand. This is\r\npowell-canyons-22.jpg\r\n\r\nTWO LARGE NECKS, THE MORE DISTANT ONE BEING THE CABAZON. MESAS IN THE\r\nFOREGROUND.\r\n\r\nthe region of the Painted Desert, for the marls and soft rocks of which\r\nthe hills are composed are of many colors--chocolate, red, vermilion,\r\npink, buff, and gray; and the naked hills are carved in fantastic\r\nforms. Passing to the region below, suddenly the channel is narrowed and\r\ntumbles down into a deep, solemn gorge with towering limestone cliffs.\r\n\r\nAll round the margin of the valley of the Little Colorado, on the side\r\nnext to the Zuñi Plateau and on the side next to the San Francisco\r\nPlateau, every creek and every brook runs in a beautiful canyon. Then\r\ndown in the valley there are stretches of desert covered with sage and\r\ngrease wood. Still farther down we come to the bad lands of the Painted\r\nDesert; and scattered through the entire region low mesas or smaller\r\nplateaus are everywhere found.\r\n\r\nOn the northeast side of the Little Colorado a great mesa country\r\nstretches far to the northward. These mesas are but minor plateaus that\r\nare separated by canyons and canyon valleys, and sometimes by\r\n\r\n46\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nlow sage plains. They rise from a few hundred to 2,000 or 3,000 feet\r\nabove the lowlands on which they are founded. The distinction between\r\nplateaus and mesas is vague; in fact, in local usage the term mesa is\r\nusually applied to all of these tables which do not carry volcanic moun-\r\npowell-canyons-23.jpg\r\n\r\nNECK SIX MILES NORTHEAST OF JUANTAFOYA.\r\n\r\ntains. The mesas are carved out of platforms of horizontal or nearly\r\nhorizontal rocks by perennial or intermittent streams, and as the\r\nclimate is exceedingly arid most of the streams flow only during seasons\r\nof rain, and for the greater part of the year they are dry arroyos. Many\r\nof the longer channels are dry for long periods. Some of them are opened\r\nonly by floods that come ten or twenty years apart.\r\n\r\nThe region is also characterized by many buttes. These are plateaus or\r\nmesas of still smaller dimensions in horizontal distance, though their\r\naltitude may be hundreds or thousands of feet. Like the mesas and\r\nplateaus, they sometimes form very conspicuous features of a landscape\r\nand are of marvelous beauty by reason of their sculptured escarpments.\r\nBelow they are often buttressed on a magnificent scale. Softer beds give\r\nrise to a vertical structure of buttresses and columns, while the harder\r\nstrata appear in great horizontal lines, suggesting\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES.\r\n\r\n47\r\n\r\narchitectural entablature. Then the strata of which these buttes are\r\ncomposed are of many vivid colors; so color and form unite in producing\r\narchitectural effects, and the buttes often appear like Cyclopean\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\nThere is yet one other peculiarity of this landscape deserving mention\r\nhere. Before the present valleys and canyons were carved and the mesas\r\nlifted in relief, the region was one of great volcanic activity. In\r\nvarious places vents were formed and floods of lava poured in sheets\r\nover the land. Then for a time volcanic action ceased, and rains and\r\nrivers carved out the valleys and left the mesas and mountains standing.\r\nThese same agencies carried away the lava beds that spread over the\r\nlands. But wherever there was a lava vent it was filled with molten\r\nmatter, which on cooling was harder than the sandstones and marls\r\nthrough which it penetrated. The chimney to the region of fire below was\r\nthus filled with a black rock which yielded more\r\n\r\n48 powell-canyons-24.jpg\r\n\r\nA GROUP OF NECKS NEAR MOUNT TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nslowly to the disintegrating agencies of weather, and so black rocks\r\nrise up from mesas on every hand. These are known as volcanic necks,\r\nand, being of a somber color, in great contrast with the vividly colored\r\nrocks from which they rise and by which they are surrounded, they\r\n\r\n48 powell-canyons-25.jpg\r\n\r\nPANORAMA FROM THE EDGE OF MOUNT TAYLOR MESA.\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES. 49\r\n\r\nlend a strange aspect to the landscape. Besides these necks, there are\r\na few volcanic mountains that tower over all the landscape and gather\r\nabout themselves the clouds of heaven. Mount Taylor, which stands over\r\nthe divide on the drainage of the Rio Grande del Norte, is one of\r\nthe most imposing of the dead volcanoes of this region. Still later\r\neruptions of lava are found here and there, and in the present valleys\r\nand canyons sheets of black basalt are often found. These are known as\r\ncoulees, and sometimes from these coulees cinder cones arise.\r\n\r\nThis valley of the Little Colorado is also the site of many ruins, and\r\nthe villages or towns found in such profusion were of mueh larger size\r\nthan those on the San Francisco Plateau. Some of the pueblo-building\r\npeoples yet remain. The Zuñi Indians still occupy their homes, and they\r\nprove to be a most interesting people. They have cultivated the soil\r\nfrom time immemorial. They build their houses of stone and line them\r\nwith plaster; and they have many interesting arts, being skilled potters\r\nand deft weavers. The seasons are about equally divided between labor,\r\nworship, and play.\r\n\r\n50\r\n\r\nA hundred miles to the northwest of the Zuñí pueblo are the seven\r\npueblos of Tusayan: Oraibi, Shumopavi, Shupaulovi, Mashongnavi,\r\nSichumovi, Walpi, and llano. These towns are built on high cliffs. The\r\npeople speak a language radically different from that of the Zuñi, but,\r\nwith the exception of that of the inhabitants of Hano, closely allied to\r\nthat of the Utes. The people of Hano are Tewans, whose ancestors moved\r\nfrom the Rio Grande to Tusayan during the great Pueblo revolt against\r\nSpanish authority in 1680-96.\r\n\r\nBetween the Little Colorado and the Rio San Juan there is a vast system\r\nof plateaus, mesas, and buttes, volcanic mountains, volcanic cones, and\r\nvolcanic cinder cones. Some of the plateaus are forest-clad and have\r\nperennial waters and are gemmed with lakelets. The mesas are sometimes\r\ntreeless, but are often covered with low, straggling, gnarled cedars and\r\npifions, trees that are intermediate in size between the bushes of\r\nsage in the desert and the forest trees of the elevated regions. On the\r\nwestern margin of this district the great Navajo Mountain stands, on the\r\nbrink of Glen Canyon, and from its summit many of the stupendous gorges\r\nof the Colorado River can be seen. Central in the region stand the\r\nCarrizo Mountains, the Lukachukai\r\n\r\n50 powell-canyons-26.jpg\r\n\r\nPANORAMA IN THE VALLEY OF THE PUERCO.\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES. 51\r\n\r\nMountains, the Tunitcha Mountains, and the Chusca Mountains, which in\r\nfact constitute one system, extending from north to south in the order\r\nnamed. These are really plateaus crowned with volcanic peaks.\r\n\r\nBut the district we are now describing, which stretches from the Little\r\nColorado to the San Juan, is best characterized by its canyons. The\r\nwhole region is a labyrinth of gorges. On the west the Navajo Creek and\r\nits tributaries run in profound chasms. Farther south the Moencopie with\r\nits tributaries is a labyrinth of gorges; and all the streams that run\r\nwest into the Colorado, south into the Little Colorado, or north into\r\nthe San Juan have carved deep, wild, and romantic gorges. Immediately\r\nwest of the Chusca Plateau the Canyon del Muerta and the Canyon de\r\nChelly are especially noticeable. Many of these canyons are carved in\r\na homogeneous red sandstone, and their walls are often vertical for\r\nhundreds of feet. Sometimes the canyons widen into narrow valleys, which\r\nare thus walled by impassable cliffs, except where lateral canyons cut\r\ntheir way through the battlements.\r\n\r\nIn these mountains, plateaus, mesas, and canyons the Navajo Indians have\r\ntheir home. The Navajos are intruders in this country. They belong\r\nto the Athapascan stock of British America and speak an Athapascan\r\nlanguage, like the Apaches of the Sierra Madre country. They are a\r\nstately, athletic, and bold people. While yet this country was a part\r\nof Mexico they acquired great herds of horses and flocks of sheep,\r\nand lived in opulence compared with many of the other tribes of North\r\nAmerica. After the acquisition of this territory by the United States\r\nthey became disaffected by reason of encroaching civilization, and the\r\npetty wars between United States troops and the Navajos were in the\r\nmain disastrous to our forces, due in part to the courage, skill, and\r\nsuperior numbers of the Navajos and in part to the character of the\r\ncountry, which is easily defended, as the routes of travel along the\r\ncanyons present excellent opportunities for defense and ambuscade. But\r\nunder the leadership and by the advice of Kit Carson these Indians were\r\nultimately conquered. This wily but brave frontiersman recommended a\r\nnew method of warfare, which was to destroy the herds and flocks of the\r\nNavajos; and this course was pursued. Regular troops with volunteers\r\nfrom California and New Mexico went into the Navajo country and shot\r\ndown their herds of half-wild horses,\r\n\r\n52\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nkilled hundreds of thousands of sheep, cut down their peach orchards\r\nwhich were scattered about the springs and little streams, destroyed\r\ntheir irrigating works, and devastated their little patches of corn,\r\nsquashes, and melons; and entirely neglected the Navajos themselves, who\r\nwere concealed among the rocks of the canyons. Seeing the destruction\r\nwrought upon their means of livelihood, the Navajos at once yielded.\r\nMore than 8,000 of them surrendered at one time, coming in in straggling\r\nbands. They were then removed far to the east, near to the Texas line,\r\nand established on a reservation at the Bosque Redondo. Here they\r\nengaged in civilized farming. A great system powell-canyons-27.jpg\r\n\r\nRUINS AT THE HEAD OF MCELMO CANYON.\r\n\r\nof irrigation was developed; but the appropriations necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of so large a body of people in the course of their passage\r\nfrom savagery to civilization seemed too great to those responsible\r\nfor making grants from the national treasury, and just before 1870 the\r\nNavajos were permitted to break up their homes at the Bosque Redondo and\r\nreturn to the canyons and cliffs of their ancient land. Millions were\r\nspent in conquering them where thousands were used to civilize them, so\r\nthat they were conquered but not civilized. Still, they are making good\r\nprogress, and have once more acquired large flocks and herds. It is\r\nestimated that they now have more than a million sheep. Their experience\r\nin irrigation at the Bosque Redondo has\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES.\r\n\r\n53\r\n\r\nnot been wholly wasted, for they now cultivate the soil by methods\r\nof irrigation greatly improved over those used in the earlier time.\r\nOriginally they dwelt in hogans, or houses made of poles arranged with\r\nmuch skill in conical form, the poles being covered with reeds and the\r\nreeds with earth; now they are copying the dwelling places of civilized\r\nmen. They have also acquired great skill in the manufacture of silver\r\nornaments, with which they decorate themselves and the trappings of\r\ntheir steeds.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting ruins of America are found in this\r\nregion. The ancient pueblos found here are of superior structure, but\r\npowell-canyons-28.jpg\r\n\r\nA NAVAJO HOGAN.\r\n\r\nthey were all built by a people whom the Navajos displaced when they\r\nmigrated from the far North. Wherever there is water, near by an ancient\r\nruin may be found; and these ruins are gathered about centers, the\r\ncenters being larger pueblos and the scattered ruins representing single\r\nhouses. The ancient people lived in villages, or pueblos, but during\r\nthe growing season they scattered about by the springs and streams to\r\ncultivate the soil by irrigation, and wherever there was a little farm\r\nor garden patch, there was built a summer house of stone. When times\r\nof war came, especially when they were invaded by the Navajos, these\r\nancient people left their homes in the pueblos and by the streams and\r\nconstructed temporary homes in the cliffs and canyon\r\n\r\n54\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nwalls. Such cliff ruins are abundant throughout the region, intimately\r\nthe ancient pueblo peoples succumbed to the prowess of the Navajos and\r\nwere driven out. A part joined related tribes in the valley of the Bio\r\nGrande; others joined the Zuñi and the people of Tusayan; and stall\r\nothers pushed on beyond the Little Colorado to the San Francisco Plateau\r\nand far down into the valley of the Gila. powell-canyons-29.jpg\r\n\r\nAN ANCIENT COILED VASE FROM TUSAYAN.\r\n\r\nFarther to the east, on the border of the region which we have\r\ndescribed, beyond the drainage of the Little Colorado and San Juan and\r\nwithin the drainage of the Rio Grande, there lies an interesting plateau\r\nregion, which forms a part of the Plateau Province and which is worthy\r\nof description. This is the great Tewan Plateau, which carries several\r\ngroups of mountains. The western edge of this plateau is known as the\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES. 55\r\n\r\nNacimiento Mountain, a long north-and-south range of granite, which\r\npresents a bold facade to the valley of the Puerco on the west.\r\nAscending to the summit of this granite range, there is presented to the\r\neastward a plateau of vast proportions, which stretches far toward Santa\r\nFe and is terminated by the canyon of the Rio Grande del Norte. The\r\neastern flank of this range as it slowly rose was a gentle slope, but as\r\nit came up fissures were formed and volcanoes burst forth and poured out\r\ntheir floods of lava, and now many extinct volcanoes can be seen. The\r\nplateau was built by these volcanoes--sheets of lava piled on sheets\r\nof lava hundreds and even thousands of feet in thickness. But with the\r\nfloods of lava came great explosions, like that of Krakatoa, by which\r\nthe heavens were filled with volcanic dust. These explosions came at\r\ndifferent times and at different places, but they were of enormous\r\nmagnitude, and when the dust fell again from the clouds it piled up in\r\nbeds scores and hundreds of feet in thickness. So the Tewan Plateau has\r\na foundation of red sandstone; upon this are piled sheets of lava and\r\nsheets of dust in many alternating layers. It is estimated that there\r\nstill remain more than two hundred cubic miles of this dust, now\r\ncompacted into somewhat coherent rocks and interpolated between sheets\r\nof lava. Everywhere this dust-formed rock is exceedingly light. Much of\r\nit has a specific gravity so low that it will float on water. Above the\r\nsheets of lava and above the beds of volcanic dust great volcanic cones\r\nrise, and the whole upper region is covered with forests interspersed\r\nwith beautiful prairies. The plateau itself is intersected with many\r\ndeep, narrow canyons, having walls of lava, volcanic dust, or tufa, and\r\nred sandstone. It is a beautiful region. The low mesas on every side are\r\nalmost treeless and are everywhere deserts, but the great Tewan Plateau\r\nis booned with abundant rains, and it is thus a region of forests and\r\nmeadows, divided into blocks by deep, precipitous canyons and crowned\r\nwith cones that rise to an altitude of from 10,000 to 12,000 feet.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries the Tewan Plateau, with its canyons below and its\r\nmeadows and forests above, has been the home of tribes of Tewan Indians,\r\nwho built pueblos, sometimes of the red sandstones in the canyons, but\r\noftener of blocks of tufa, or volcanic dust. This light material can be\r\nworked with great ease, and with crude tools of the\r\n\r\n56\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nharder lavas they cut out blocks of the tufa and with them built pueblos\r\ntwo or three stories high. The blocks are usually about twenty inches in\r\nlength, eight inches in width, and six inches in thickness, though they\r\nvary somewhat in size. On the volcanic cones which dominate the country\r\nthese people built shrines and worshiped their gods with offerings of\r\nmeal and water and with prayer symbols made of the plumage of the birds\r\nof the air. When the Navajo invasion came, by which kindred tribes were\r\ndisplaced from the district farther west, these Tewan Indians left their\r\npueblos on the plateau and their dwellings by the rivers below in the\r\ndepths of the canyon and constructed cavate homes for themselves;\r\nthat is, they excavated chambers in the cliffs where these cliffs were\r\ncomposed of soft, friable tufa. On the face of the cliff, hundreds of\r\nfeet high and thousands of feet or even miles in length, they dug out\r\nchambers with stone tools, these chambers being little rooms eight or\r\nten feet in diameter. Sometimes two or more such chambers connected.\r\nThen they constructed stairways in the soft rock, by which their cavate\r\nhouses were reached; and in these rock shelters they lived during times\r\npowell-canyons-30.jpg\r\n\r\nA TYPICAL CLIFF DWELLING.\r\n\r\n57 powell-canyons-31.jpg\r\n\r\nA ROOM IN A PUEBLO.\r\n\r\n58\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nof war. When the Navajo invasion was long past, civilized men as Spanish\r\nadventurers entered this country from Mexico, and again the Tewan\r\npeoples left their homes on the mesas and by the canyons to find safety\r\nin the cavate dwellings of the cliffs; and now the archaeologist in the\r\nstudy of this country discovers these two periods of construction and\r\noccupation of the cavate dwellings of the Tewan Indians.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Rio San Juan another vast plateau region is found,\r\nstretching to the Grand River. The mountains of this region are the La\r\nPlata Mountains, Bear River Mountains, and San Miguel Mountains on the\r\neast, and the Sierra El Late, the Sierra Abajo, and the Sierra La Sal on\r\nthe west, the latter standing near the brink of Cataract Canyon, through\r\nwhich the Colorado flows immediately below the junction of the Grand and\r\nGreen. Throughout the region mountains, volcanic cones, volcanic necks,\r\nand coulees are found, while the mountains themselves rise to great\r\naltitudes and are forest-clad. Some of the plateaus attain huge\r\nproportions, and between the plateaus labyrinthian mesas are found.\r\nButtes, as stupendous cameos, are scattered everywhere, and the whole\r\nregion is carved with canyons.\r\n\r\nGrand River heads on the back of Long's Peak, in the Front Range of the\r\nRocky Mountains of central Colorado. At the foot of the mountain lies\r\nGrand Lake, a sheet of emerald water that duplicates the forest\r\nstanding on its brink. Out of the lake flows Grand River, gathering on\r\npowell-canyons-32.jpg\r\n\r\nA NAVAJO READY FOR A JOURNEY.\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES.\r\n\r\n59\r\n\r\nits way the many mountain streams whose waters fill the solitude with\r\nperennial music--a symphony of cascades. In Middle Park boiling springs\r\nissue from depths below and gather in pools covered with con-fervae.\r\nLeaving Middle Park the river goes through a great range known as the\r\nGore's Pass Mountains; and still it flows on toward the Colorado, now\r\nthrough canyon and now through valley, until the last forty miles of its\r\ncourse it finds its way through a beautiful gorge known as Grand River\r\nCanyon. In its principal course this canyon is a bright red homogeneous\r\nsandstone, and the walls are often vertical and of great symmetry.\r\nFarther down, its walls are rugged and angular, being composed of\r\nlimestones.\r\n\r\nThe principal tributaries from the south are the Blue, which heads in\r\nMt. Lincoln, and the Gunnison, which heads in the Wasatch Mountains.\r\nThese streams are also characterized by deep canyons and plateaus, and\r\nmesas abound on every hand. Between the Grand River and the White River,\r\nfarther to the east, the Tavaputs Plateau is found. It begins at the\r\nfoot of Gore's Pass Range and extends down between the rivers last\r\nmentioned to the very brink of Green River, which is in fact the upper\r\nColorado. Between the Grand River and the powell-canyons-33.jpg\r\n\r\nA NAVAJO BOY.\r\n\r\n60\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nfoot of this plateau there is a low, narrow valley with mesas and\r\nbuttes. Then the country suddenly rises by a stupendous line of cliffs\r\n2,000 or 3,000 feet high. These cliffs are composed of sand stones,\r\nlimestones, and shales, of many colors. The stratification in many\r\nplaces is minute, so that they have been called the Book Cliffs.\r\npowell-canyons-34.jpg\r\n\r\nGARDENS OF ZUÑI.\r\n\r\nFrom the cliffs many salients are projected into the valleys, and within\r\ndeep re-entering angles vast amphitheaters appear. About the projected\r\nsalients many towering buttes, with pinnacles and minarets, are found.\r\nThe long, narrow plateau is covered with a forest along its summit, and,\r\nthough it rises abruptly on the south side from Grand River Valley, it\r\ndescends more gently toward the White River, and on\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES.\r\n\r\n61 powell-canyons-35.jpg\r\n\r\nA TUSAYAN LADDER.\r\n\r\nthis slope many canyons of rare beauty are seen. Plateaus and mesas\r\nand canyons and buttes characterize the region north of White River and\r\nstretch out to the Yampa. The Yampa itself has an important tributary\r\nfrom the northwest, known as Snake River. Just below the affluence of\r\nthe Snake with the Yampa a strange phenomenon is observed. Right athwart\r\nthe course of the river rises a great dome-shaped mountain, with valley\r\nstretches on every side, and through this mountain the river runs,\r\ndividing it by a beautiful canyon, through which it flows to its\r\njunction with the Green. This canyon is in soft, white sandstone,\r\nusually with vertical walls varying from 500 to 2,000 feet in height,\r\nand the river flows in a gentle winding way through all this stretch.\r\nTo the east of this plateau region, with its mesas and buttes and\r\nits volcanic mountains, stand the southern Rocky Mountains, or Park\r\nMountains, a system of north-and-south ranges. These ranges are huge\r\nbillows in the crust of the earth out of which mountains have been\r\ncarved. The parks of Colorado are great valley basins enclosed by these\r\nranges, and over their surfaces moss agates are scattered. The mountains\r\nare covered with dense forests and are rugged and wild. The higher peaks\r\nrise above the timber line and are naked gorges of rocks. In them the\r\nPlatte and Arkansas rivers head and flow eastward to join the Missouri\r\nRiver. Here also heads the Rio Grande del Norte, which flows southward\r\ninto the Gulf of Mexico, and still to the west head many streams which\r\npour into the Colorado waters destined for the Gulf of California.\r\nThroughout all of this region drained by the Grand, White, and\r\nYampa rivers, there are many beautiful parks. The great moun-\r\npowell-canyons-36.jpg\r\n\r\nA ZUÑÍ STOOL.\r\n\r\n62\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\ntain slopes are still covered with primeval forests. Springs, brooks,\r\nrivers, and lakes abound, and the waters are filled with trout. Not many\r\nyears ago the hills were covered with game--elk on the mountains, deer\r\non the plateaus, antelope in the valleys, and beavers building their\r\ncities on the streams. The plateaus are covered with low, dwarf oaks\r\nand many shrubs bearing berries, and in the chaparral of this region\r\ncinnamon bears are still abundant.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial the region drained by the Grand, White, and\r\nYampa rivers has been the home of Ute tribes of the Shoshonean\r\npowell-canyons-37.jpg\r\n\r\nA TUSAYAN FIELD SHELTER.\r\n\r\nfamily of Indians. These people built their shelters of boughs and bark,\r\nand to some extent lived in tents made of the skins of animals. They\r\nnever cultivated the soil, but gathered wild seeds and roots and were\r\nfamous hunters and fishermen. As the region abounds in game, these\r\ntribes have always been well clad in skins and furs. The men wore\r\nblouse, loincloth leggins, and moccasins, and the women dressed in\r\nshort kilts. It is curious to notice the effect which the contact of\r\ncivilization has had upon these women's dress. Even twenty years ago\r\nthey had lengthened their skirts; and dresses, made of buckskin, fringed\r\nwith furs, and beaded with elk teeth, were worn so long that they\r\ntrailed\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES.\r\n\r\n63\r\n\r\non the ground. Neither men nor women wore any headdress except on\r\nfestival occasions for decoration; then the women wore little basket\r\nbonnets decorated with feathers, and the men wore headdresses made of\r\nthe skins of ducks, geese, eagles, and other large birds. Sometimes they\r\nwould prepare the skin of the head of the elk or deer, or of a bear or\r\nmountain lion or wolf, for a headdress. For very cold weather both men\r\nand women were provided with togas for their protection. Sometimes\r\nthe men would have a bearskin or elkskin for a toga; more\r\npowell-canyons-38.jpg\r\n\r\nANOTHER TUSAYAN FIELD SHELTER.\r\n\r\noften they made their togas by piecing together the skins of wolves,\r\nmountain lions, wolverines, wild cats, beavers, and otters. The women\r\nsometimes made theirs of fawnskins, but rabbitskin r,obes were far more\r\ncommon. These rabbitskins were tanned with the fur on, and cut into\r\nstrips; then cords were made of the fiber of wild flax or yucca plants,\r\nand round these cords the strips of rabbitskin were rolled, so that\r\nthey made long ropes of rabbitskin coils with a central cord of vegetal\r\nfiber; then these coils were woven in parallel strings with cross\r\n\r\n64 powell-canyons-39.jpg\r\n\r\nVIEW OF HANO, ONE OF THE SEVEN PUEBLOS OF TUSAYAN. powell-canyons-40.jpg\r\n\r\nMESA VERDE.\r\n\r\nMESAS AND BUTTES. 65\r\n\r\nstrands of fiber.

The heroes of these stories are the beasts, birds, and\r\nreptiles of the region, and the themes of the stories are the doings\r\nof these mythic beasts--the ancients from whom the present animals have\r\ndescended and degenerated. The primeval animals were wonderful\r\nbeings, as related in the lore of the Utes. They were the creators and\r\ncontrollers of all the phenomena of nature known to these simple-minded\r\npeople. The Utes are zootheists. Each little tribe has its Shaman, or\r\nmedicine man, who is historian, priest, and doctor. The lore of this\r\nShaman is composed of mythic tales of ancient animals. The Indians\r\nare very skillful actors, and they represent the parts of beasts or\r\nreptiles, wearing masks and imitating the ancient zoic gods. In temples\r\nwalled with gloom of night and illumed by torch fires the people gather\r\nabout their Shaman, who tells and acts the stories of creation recorded\r\nin their traditional bible. When fever prostrates one of the tribe\r\nthe Shaman gathers the actors about the stricken man, and with weird\r\ndancing, wild ululation, and ecstatic exhortation the evil spirit is\r\ndriven from the body. Then they have their ceremonies to pray for\r\nthe forest fruits, for abundant game, for successful hunting, and for\r\nprosperity in war.\r\n\r\n66 powell-canyons-41.jpg\r\n\r\nMOUNT MORAN, TETON RANGE, WYOMING.\r\n\r\n67\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS AND PLATEAUS.\r\n\r\nGREEN RIVER has its source in Fremont's Peak, high up in the Wind River\r\nMountains among glacial lakes and mountain cascades. This is the real\r\nsource of the Colorado River, and it stands in strange contrast with\r\nthe mouth of that stream where it pours into the Gulf of California.\r\nThe general course of the river is from north to south and from great\r\naltitudes to the level of the sea. Thus it runs \"from land of snow\r\nto land of sun.\" The Wind River Mountains constitute one of the most\r\nimposing ranges of the United States. Fremont's Peak, the culminating\r\npoint, is 13,790 feet above the level of the sea. It stands in a\r\nwilderness of crags. Here at Fremont's Peak three great rivers have\r\ntheir sources: Wind River flows eastward into the Mississippi; Green\r\nRiver flows southward into the Colorado; and Gros Ventre River flows\r\nnorthwestward into the Columbia. From this dominating height many ranges\r\ncan be seen on every hand. About the sources of the Platte and the Big\r\nHorn, that flow ultimately into the Gulf of Mexico, great ranges stand\r\nwith their culminating peaks among the clouds; and the mountains that\r\nextend into Yellowstone Park, the land of geyser wonders, are seen.\r\nThe Yellowstone Park is at the southern extremity of a great system\r\nof mountain ranges, the northern Rocky Mountains, sometimes called the\r\nGeyser Ranges. This geological province extends into British America,\r\nbut its most wonderful scenery is in the upper Yellowstone basin, where\r\ngeysers bombard the heavens with vapor distilled in subterranean depths.\r\nThe springs which pour out their boiling waters are loaded with quartz,\r\nand the waters of the springs, flowing away over the rocks, slowly\r\ndischarge their fluid magma, which crystallizes in beautiful forms and\r\nbuilds jeweled basins that hold pellucid waters.\r\n\r\n68 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nTo the north and west of Fremont's Peak are mountain ranges that give\r\nbirth to rivers flowing into the great Columbia. Conspicuous among these\r\nfrom this point of view is the great Teton Range, with its towering\r\nfacade of storm-carved rocks; then the Gros Ventre Mountains, the Snake\r\nRiver Range, the Wyoming Range, and, still beyond the latter, the\r\nBear River Range, are seen. Far in the distant south, scarcely to be\r\ndistinguished from the blue clouds on the horizon, stand the Uinta\r\nMountains. On every hand are deep mountain gorges where snows accumulate\r\nto form glaciers. Below the glaciers throughout the entire Wind River\r\nRange great numbers of morainal lakes are found. These lakes are\r\ngems--deep sapphire waters fringed with emerald zones. From these lakes\r\ncreeks and rivers flow, by cataracts and rapids, to form the Green. The\r\nmountain slopes below are covered with dense forests of pines and firs.\r\nThe lakes are often fringed with beautiful aspens, and when the autumn\r\nwinds come their golden leaves are carried over the landscape in clouds\r\nof resplendent sheen. The creeks descend from the mountains in wild\r\nrocky gorges, until they flow out into the valley. On the west side of\r\nthe valley stand the Gros Ventre and the Wyoming mountains, low ranges\r\nof peaks, but picturesque in form and forest stretch. Leaving the\r\nmountain, the river meanders through the Green River Plains, a cold\r\nelevated district much like that of northern Norway, except that the\r\nhumidity of Norway is replaced by the aridity of Wyoming. South of the\r\nplains the Big Sandy joins the Green from the east. South of the Big\r\nSandy a long zone of sand-dunes stretches eastward. The western winds\r\nblowing up the valley drift these sands from hill to hill, so that the\r\nhills themselves are slowly journeying eastward on the wings of arid\r\ngales, and sand tempests may be encountered more terrible than storms\r\nof snow or hail. Here the northern boundary of the Plateau Province is\r\nfound, for mesas and high table-lands are found on either side of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n69\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the Green, mesas and plateaus have irregular\r\nescarpments with points extending into the valleys, and between these\r\npoints canyons come down that head in the highlands. Everywhere the\r\nescarpments are fringed with outlying buttes. Many portions of the\r\nregion are characterized by bad lands. These are hills carved out of\r\nsandstone, shales, and easily disintegrated rocks, which present many\r\n\r\n69 powell-canyons-42.jpg\r\n\r\nMARBLE BASINS, MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, YELLOWSTONE PARK.\r\n\r\n70 powell-canyons-43.jpg\r\n\r\nTERRACED BASINS, MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, YELLOWSTONE PABK.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS AND PLATEAUS. 71\r\n\r\nfantastic forms and are highly colored in a great variety of tint and\r\ntone, and everywhere they are naked of vegetation. Now and then low\r\nmountains crown the plateaus. Altogether it is a region of desolation.\r\nThrough the midst of the country, from east to west, flows an\r\nintermittent stream known as Bitter Creek. In seasons of rain it carries\r\nfloods; in seasons of drought it disappears in the sands, and its waters\r\nare alkaline and often poisonous. Stretches of bad-land desert are\r\ninterrupted by other stretches of sage plain, and on the high lands\r\ngnarled and picturesque forests of juniper and piñón are found. On the\r\nwest side of the river the mesas rise by grassy slopes to the westward\r\ninto high plateaus that are forest-clad, first with juniper and piñon,\r\nand still higher with pines and firs. Some of the streams run in canyons\r\nand others have elevated valleys along their courses. On the south\r\nborder of this mesa and plateau country are the Bridger Bad Lands, lying\r\nat the foot of the Uinta Mountains. These bad lands are of gray, green,\r\nand brown shales that are carved in picturesque forms--domes, towers,\r\npinnacles, and minarets, and bold cliffs with deep alcoves; and all are\r\nnaked rock, the sediments of an ancient lake. These lake beds are filled\r\nwith fossils,--the preserved bones of fishes, reptiles, and mammals, of\r\nstrange and often gigantic forms, no longer found living on the globe.\r\nIt is a desert to the agriculturist, a mine to the paleontologist, and a\r\nparadise to the artist.\r\n\r\nThe region thus described, from Fremont's Peak to the Uinta Mountains,\r\nhas been the home of tribes of Indians of the Shoshonean family from\r\ntime immemorial. It is a great hunting and fishing region, and the\r\nvigorous Shoshones still obtain a part of their livelihood from mesa and\r\nplain and river and lake. The flesh of the animals killed in fall and\r\nwinter was dried in the arid winds for summer use; the trout abounding\r\nin the streams and lakes were caught at all seasons of the year; and the\r\nseeds and fruits of harvest time were gathered and preserved for winter\r\nuse. When the seeds were gathered they were winnowed by tossing them\r\nin trays so that the winds might carry away the chaff. Then they were\r\nroasted in the same trays. Burning coals and seeds were mixed in the\r\nbasket trays and kept in motion by a tossing process which fanned the\r\ncoals until the seeds were done; then they were separated from the coals\r\nby dexterous manipulation. Afterwards the seeds were ground on\r\n\r\n72 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nmealing-stones and molded into cakes, often huge loaves, that were\r\nstored away for use in time of need. Raspberries, chokecherries, and\r\nbuffalo berries are abundant, and these fruits were gathered and mixed\r\nwith the bread. Such fruit cakes were great dainties among these people.\r\n\r\nIn this Shoshone land the long winter night is dedicated to worship and\r\nfestival. About their camp fires scattered in forest glades by\r\nbrooks and lakes, they assemble to dance and sing in honor of their\r\ngods--wonderful mythic animals, for they hold as divine the ancient\r\nof bears, the eagle of the lost centuries, the rattlesnake of primeval\r\ntimes, and a host of other zoic deities.\r\n\r\nThe Uinta Range stands across the course of Green River, which finds\r\nits way through it by series of stupendous canyons. The range has an\r\neast-and-west trend. The Wasatch Mountains, a long north-and-south\r\nrange, here divide the Plateau Province from what is known among\r\ngeologists as the Basin Range Province, on the west. The latter is the\r\ngreat interior basin whose waters run into salt lakes and sinks, there\r\nbeing no drainage to the sea. The Great Salt Lake is the most important\r\nof these interior bodies of water.\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin, which lies to the west of the Plateau Province, forms\r\na part of the Basin Range Province. In past geological times it was the\r\nsite of a vast system of lakes, but the climate has since changed and\r\nthe water of most of these lakes has evaporated and the sediments of the\r\nold lake beds are now desert sands. The ancient lake shores are often\r\nrepresented by conspicuous terraces, each one marking a stage in the\r\nheight of a dead lake. While these lakes existed the region was one of\r\ngreat volcanic activity and many eruptive mountains were formed. Some\r\nburst out beneath the waters; others were piled up on the dry land.\r\n\r\nFrom the desert valleys below, the Wasatch Mountains rise abruptly and\r\nare crowned with craggy peaks. But on the east side of the mountains the\r\ndescent to the plateau is comparatively slight. The Uinta Mountains\r\nare carved out of the great plateau which extends more than two hundred\r\nmiles to the eastward of the summit of the Wasatch Range. Its mountain\r\npeaks are cameos, its upper valleys are meadows, its higher slopes\r\nare forest groves, and its streams run in deep, solemn, and majestic\r\ncanyons. The snows never melt from its crowning heights, and an undying\r\nanthem is sung by its falling waters.\r\n\r\n73 powell-canyons-44.jpg\r\n\r\nTABERNACLE CRATER AND LAVA BEDS OF THE BASIN PROVINCE.\r\n\r\n74 powell-canyons-45.jpg\r\n\r\nVIEW ON GREAT SALT LAKE DESERT, SHOWING MOUNTAINS HALF BURIED BY LAKE\r\nSEDIMENTS.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS AND PLATEAUS. 75\r\n\r\nThe Owiyukuts Plateau is situated at the northeastern end of the Uinta\r\nMountains. It is a great integral block of the Uinta system. A beautiful\r\ncreek heads in this plateau, near its center, and descends northward\r\ninto the bad lands of Vermilion Creek, to which stream it is tributary.\r\n\"Once upon a time\" this creek, after descending from the plateau, turned\r\neast and then southward and found its way by a beautiful canyon into\r\nBrown's Park, where it joined the Green; but a great bend of the\r\nVermilion, near the foot of the plateau, was gradually enlarged--the\r\nstream cutting away its banks--until it encroached upon the little\r\nvalley of the creek born on the Owiyukuts Plateau. This encroachment\r\ncontinued until at last Vermilion Creek stole the Owiyukuts Creek and\r\ncarried its waters away by its own channel. Then the canyon channel\r\nthrough which Owiyukuts Creek had previously run, no longer having a\r\nstream to flow through its deep gorge, gathered the waters of brooks\r\nflowing along its course into little lakelets, which are connected by a\r\nrunning stream only through seasons of great rainfall. These lakelets in\r\nthe gorge of the dead creek are now favorite resorts of Ute Indians.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Uinta Mountains is the Uinta River, a stream with many\r\nmountain tributaries, some heading in the Uinta Mountains, others in the\r\nWasatch Mountains on the west, and still others in the western Tavaputs\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\nThe Uinta Valley is the ancient and present home of the Uinta Indians,\r\na tribe speaking the Uinta language of the Shoshonean family. Their\r\nhabits, customs, institutions, and mythology are essentially the same as\r\nthose of the Ute Indians of the Grand River country, already\r\ndescribed. In this valley there are also found many ruins of ancient\r\npueblo-building peoples--of what stock is not known.\r\n\r\nThe Tavaputs Plateau is one of the stupendous features of this country.\r\nOn the west it merges into the Wasatch Mountains; on the north\r\nit descends by wooded slopes into the Uinta Valley. Its summit is\r\nforest-clad and among the forests are many beautiful parks. On the south\r\nit ends in a great escarpment which descends into Castle Valley. This\r\nsouthern escarpment presents one of the most wonderful facades of the\r\nworld. It is from 2,000 to 4,000 feet high. The descent is not made by\r\none bold step, for it is cut by canyons and cliffs. It is a zone several\r\n\r\n76\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nmiles in width which is a vast labyrinth of canyons, cliffs, buttes,\r\npinnacles, minarets, and detached rocks of Cyclopean magnitude, the\r\nwhole destitute of soil and vegetation, colored in many brilliant\r\ntones and tints, and carved in many weird forms,--a land of desolation,\r\ndedicated forever to the geologist and the artist, where civilization\r\ncan find no resting-place.\r\n\r\nThen comes Castle Valley, to describe which is to beggar language and\r\npall imagination. On the north is the Tavaputs; on the west is the\r\nWasatch Plateau, which lies to the south of the Wasatch Mountains and\r\nis here the west boundary of the Plateau Province; on the south are\r\nindescribable mesas and mountains; on the east is Grand River, a placid\r\nstream meandering through a valley of meadows. Within these boundaries\r\nthere is a landscape of gigantic rock forms, interrupted here and there\r\nby bad-land hills, dominated with the towering cliffs of Tavaputs, the\r\nbold escarpment of the Wasatch Plateau, and the volcanic peaks of the\r\nHenry Mountains on the south. It is a vast forest of rock forms, and\r\nin its midst is San Rafael Swell, an elevation crowned with still more\r\ngigantic rock forms. Among the rocks pools and lakelets are found, and\r\nlittle streams run in canyons that seem like chasms cleft to nadir\r\n\r\n77 powell-canyons-46.jpg\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN HUNTER. ... ....\r\n\r\n78 powell-canyons-47.jpg\r\n\r\nRESERVOIR BUTTE, SHOWING TERRACES OF THE ANCIENT LAKE BONNEVILLE\r\nSHORELINES.\r\n\r\n79 powell-canyons-48.jpg\r\n\r\nPAVANT BUTTE, OVER A SUBMARINE VOLCANO OF THE GREAT\r\n\r\nBASIN.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS AND PLATEAUS.\r\n\r\n80\r\n\r\nhell. San Rafael River and Fremont River drain this Castle land, heading\r\nin the Wasatch Plateau and flowing into the Grand River. Along these\r\nstreams a few narrow canyon valleys are found, and in them Ute Indians\r\nmake their winter homes. The bad lands are filled with agates, jaspers,\r\nand carnelians, which are gathered by the Indians and fashioned\r\npowell-canyons-49.jpg\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN CAMP.\r\n\r\ninto arrowheads and knives; along the foot of the canyon cliffs\r\nworkshops can be discovered that have been occupied by generations\r\nfrom a time in the long past, and the chips of these workshops pave the\r\nvalleys. South of the Wasatch Plateau we have the Fish Lake Plateau,\r\nthe Awapa Plateau, and the Aquarius Plateau, which separate the waters\r\nflowing into the Great Basin from the waters of the Colorado, which\r\n\r\n81\r\n\r\n80\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nhere constitute the boundary of the Plateau Province. Awapa is a Ute\r\nname signifying \"Many waters.\"\r\n\r\nAll three of these plateaus are remarkable for the many lakelets found\r\non them. To the east are the Henry Mountains, a group of volcanic\r\ndomes that rise above the region. The rocks of the country\r\npowell-canyons-50.jpg\r\n\r\nINDIANS GAMBLING.\r\n\r\nare limestones, sandstones, and shales, originally lying in horizontal\r\naltitudes; but volcanic forces were generated under them and lavas\r\nboiled up. These lavas did not, however, come to the surface, but as\r\nthey rose they lifted the sandstones, shales, and limestones, to a\r\nthickness of 2,000 or 3,000 feet or more, into great domes. Then the\r\nmolten lavas cooled in great lenses of mountain magnitude, with the\r\n\r\n82 powell-canyons-51.jpg\r\n\r\nRUIN NEAR MOENKOPI. powell-canyons-52.jpg\r\n\r\nRUINS OF PAYUPKI, SIX MILES NORTHWEST OF MASHONGNAVI, TUSAYAN.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS AND PLATEAUS. 83\r\n\r\nsedimentary rocks domed above them. Then the clouds gathered over these\r\ndomes and wept, and their tears were gathered in brooks, and the brooks\r\ncarved canyons down the sides of the domes; and now in these deep clefts\r\nthe structure of the mountains is revealed. The lenses of volcanic rocks\r\nby which the domes were upheaved are known as \"laccolites,\" i. e., rock\r\nlakes.\r\n\r\nLooking southwestward from the Henry Mountains the Circle Cliffs are\r\nseen. A great escarpment, several thousand feet in height and 70 or 80\r\nmiles in length, faces the mountain. It is the step to the long, narrow\r\nplateau. The streams that come down across these cliffs head in great\r\nsymmetric amphitheaters, and when first seen from above they present\r\na vast alignment of walled circles. The front of the cliffs, seen from\r\nbelow, is everywhere imposing. On the southwest the Escalante River\r\nholds its course. It heads in the Aquarius Plateau and flows into the\r\nColorado. Its course, as well as that of all its many tributaries, is in\r\ndeep box-canyons of homogeneous red sandstone, often with vertical walls\r\nthat are broken by many beautiful alcoves and glens. Much of the region\r\nis of naked, smooth, red rock, but the alcoves and glens that break the\r\ncanyon walls are the sites of perennial springs, about which patches of\r\nluxuriant verdure gather.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiparowits Plateau is an elevated table-land on the southwestern\r\nside of the Escalante River. It is long and narrow, extending from the\r\nnorthwest to the southeast approximately parallel with the Escalante.\r\nIt rises above the red sandstone of the Escalante region from 2,000\r\nto 4,000 feet by a front of storm-carved cliffs. From the southeastern\r\nextremity of this plateau, at an altitude of 7,500 feet, an instructive\r\nview is obtained. One of the great canyons of the Colorado River can be\r\nseen meandering its way through the red-rock landscape. In the distance,\r\nand to the north, the Henry Mountains are in view, and below, the\r\ncanyons of the Escalante and the red-rock land are in sight. Across the\r\nColorado are the canyons of the San Juan, and below the mouth of the San\r\nJuan is the great Navajo Mountain. Still to the south the Grand Canyon\r\nof the Colorado is in view, and in the west a vast mesa landscape is\r\npresented with its buttes and pinnacles. Still to the southward Paria\r\nRiver is seen heading in a plateau on the margin of the province and\r\nhaving a course a little east of south into the Colorado.\r\n\r\n84 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nThe region of country which has been thus described, from the Tava-puts\r\nPlateau to the Paria River, was the home of a few scattered Ute Indians,\r\nwho lived in very small groups, and who hunted on the plateau, fished in\r\nthe waters, and dwelt in the canyons. There was nominally but one\r\ntribe, but as the members of this tribe were in very small parties and\r\nseparated by wide distances the tribal bonds were very weak and often\r\nunrecognized. The chief integrating agency was religion, for they\r\nworshiped the same gods and periodically joined in the same religious\r\nceremonies and festivals. A country so destitute of animal and vegetal\r\nlife would not support large numbers, and the few who dwelt here gained\r\nbut a precarious and scant subsistence. To a large extent they lived on\r\nseeds and roots. The low, warm canyons furnished admirable shelter for\r\nthe people, and their habitual costumes were loincloths, paints, and\r\nnecklaces of tiny arrowheads made of the bright-colored agates and\r\ncarnelians strung on snakeskins.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mormon people encroached on this country from the west, and\r\nwhen the Navajos on the east surrendered to the United States, a few\r\nrecalcitrant Navajos and the Utes of this region combined. They had long\r\nbeen more or less intimately associated, and a jargon speech had grown\r\nup by which they could communicate. Finally, the greater number of these\r\nUtes and renegade Navajos took up their homes permanently on the eastern\r\nbank of the Colorado River between the Grand and the San Juan rivers.\r\nThe Navajos are the dominant race, yet they live on terms of practical\r\nequality and affiliate without feuds. These are the great Freebooters of\r\nthe Plateau Province--the enemies of other tribes and of the white men.\r\nIn their canyon fortresses they have been able to hold their ground in\r\nspite of their enemies on every hand.\r\n\r\nThroughout the region and the plateaus by which it is surrounded and the\r\nmountains by which it is interrupted, everywhere ruins of pueblos and\r\nmany cliff dwellings are found. None of these ancient pueblos are on\r\na large scale. The houses were usually one or two stories high and the\r\nhamlets rarely provided shelter for more than two dozen people. Some of\r\nthe houses are of rather superior architecture, having well-constructed\r\nwalls with good geometric proportions. Their houses were plastered on\r\nthe inside, and sometimes on the outside,\r\n\r\n85 powell-canyons-53.jpg\r\n\r\nSHUPAULOVI.\r\n\r\n86 powell-canyons-54.jpg\r\n\r\nGENERAL VIEW OF ZUÑI, LOOKING WEST.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS AND PLATEAUS. 87\r\n\r\nand covered with flat roofs of sun-dried mud. The real home of the\r\npeople in their waking hours was on their housetops.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the mountain are etched with many picture-writings\r\nattesting the artistic skill of this people. The predominant form is the\r\nrattlesnake, which is found in the crevices of the rocks on every hand.\r\nIt is inferred that the people worshiped the rattlesnake as one of their\r\nchief deities, a god who carried the spirit of death in his mouth.\r\n\r\n88 powell-canyons-55.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE GRAY CLIFFS.\r\n\r\n89\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCLIFFS AND TERRACES.\r\n\r\nTHERE is a great group of table-lands constituting a geographic unit\r\nwhich have been named the Terrace Plateaus. They ex-tend from the Paria\r\nand Colorado on the east to the Grand Wash and Pine Mountains on the\r\nwest, and they are bounded on the south by the Grand Canyon of the\r\nColorado, and on the north they divide the waters of the Colorado from\r\nthe waters of the Sevier, which flows northward and then westward until\r\nit is lost in the sands of the Great Desert. It is an irregular system\r\nof great plateaus with subordinate mesas and buttes separated by lines\r\nof cliffs and dissected by canyons.\r\n\r\nIn this region all of the features which have been described as found\r\nin other portions of the province are grouped except only the cliffs of\r\nvolcanic ashes, the volcanic cones, and the volcanic domes. The\r\nvolcanic mountains, cinder cones, and coulees, the majestic plateaus and\r\nelaborate mesas, the sculptured buttes and canyon gorges, are all found\r\nhere, but on a more stupendous scale. The volcanic mountains are higher,\r\nthe cinder cones are larger, the coulees are more extensive and are\r\noften sheets of naked, black rock, the plateaus are more lofty, the\r\ncliffs are on a grander scale, the canyons are of profounder depth; and\r\nthe Grand Canyon of the Colorado, the most stupendous gorge known on the\r\nglobe, with a great river surging through it, bounds it on the south.\r\n\r\nThe east-and-west cliffs are escarpments of degradation, the\r\nnorth-and-south cliffs are, in the main, though not always, escarpments\r\nof displacement. Let us understand what this means. Over the entire\r\nregion limestones, shales, and sandstones were deposited through long\r\nperiods of geologic time to the thickness of many thousands of feet;\r\nthen the country was upheaved and tilted toward the north; but the\r\nColorado\r\n\r\n90\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO. powell-canyons-56.jpg\r\n\r\nRiver was flowing when the tilting commenced, and the upheaval was very\r\nslow, so that the river cleared away the obstruction to its channel as\r\nfast as it was presented, and this is the Grand Canyon. The rocks above\r\nwere carried away by rains and rivers, but not evenly all over the\r\ncountry; nor by washing out valleys and leaving hills, but by carving\r\nthe country into terraces. The upper and later-formed rocks are found\r\nfar to the north, their edges standing in cliffs; then still earlier\r\nrocks are found rising to the southward, until they terminate in cliffs;\r\nand then a third series rises to the southward and ends in cliffs, and\r\nfinally a fourth series, the oldest rocks, terminating in the Grand\r\nCanyon wall, which is a line of cliffs. There are in a general way four\r\ngreat lines of cliffs extending from east to west across the district\r\nand presenting their faces, or escarpments, southward. If these cliffs\r\nare climbed it is found that each plateau or terrace dips gently to\r\nthe northward until it meets with another line of cliffs, which must be\r\nascended to reach the summit of another plateau. Place a book before you\r\non a table with its front edge toward you, rest another book on the back\r\nof this, place a third on the back of the second, and in like manner a\r\nfourth on the third. Now the leaves of the books dip from you and the\r\ncut edges stand in tiny escarpments facing you. So the rock-formed\r\nleaves of\r\n\r\n91\r\n\r\nV powell-canyons-57.jpg\r\n\r\nA GROUP OF STONE CORRALS.\r\n\r\n92 powell-canyons-58.jpg\r\n\r\nRUINS.\r\n\r\nCLIFFS AND TERRACES. 93\r\n\r\nthese books of geology have the escarpment edges turned southward, while\r\neach book itself dips northward, and the crest of each plateau book\r\nis the summit of a line of cliffs. These cliffs of erosion have been\r\ndescribed as running from east to west, but they diverge from that\r\ncourse in many ways. First, canyons run from north to south through\r\nthem, and where these canyons are found deep angles occur; then sharp\r\nsalients extend from the cliffs on the backs of the lower plateaus. Each\r\ngreat escarpment is made up more or less of minor terraces, or steps;\r\nand at the foot of each grand escarpment there is always a great talus,\r\nor sloping pile of rocks, and many marvelous buttes stand in front of\r\nthe cliffs.\r\n\r\nBut these east-and-west cliffs and the plateaus which they form are\r\ndivided by north-and-south lines in another manner. The country has been\r\nfaulted along north-and-south lines or planes. These faults are breaks\r\nin the strata varying from 1,000 or 2,000 to 4,000 or 5,000 feet in\r\nverticality. On the very eastern margin the rocks are dropped down\r\nseveral thousand feet, or, which means the same thing, the rocks are\r\nupheaved on the west side; that is, the beds that were originally\r\nhorizontal have been differentially displaced, so that on the west side\r\nof the fracture the strata are several thousand feet higher than they\r\nare on the east side of the fracture. The line of displacement is known\r\nas the Echo Cliff Fault. West of this about twenty-five miles, there is\r\nanother fault with its throw to the east, the upheaved rocks being\r\non the west. This fault varies from 1,500 to 2,500 feet in throw, and\r\nextends far to the northward. It is known as the East Kaibab Fault.\r\nStill going westward, another fault is found, known as the West Kaibab\r\nFault. Here the throw is on the west side,--that is, the rocks are\r\ndropped down to the westward from 1,000 to 2,000 feet. This fault\r\ngradually becomes less to the northward and is flexed toward the east\r\nuntil it joins with the East Kaibab Fault. The block between the two\r\nfaults is the Kaibab Plateau. Going westward from 60 to 70 miles, still\r\nanother fault is found, known as the Hurricane Ledge Fault. The throw\r\nis again on the west side of the fracture and the rocks fall down some\r\nthousands of feet. This fault extends far northward into central Utah.\r\nTo the west 25 or 30 miles is found a fault with the throw still on the\r\nwest. It has a drop of several thousand feet and extends across the Rio\r\nColorado far to\r\n\r\n94 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthe southwest, probably beyond the Arizona-New Mexico line. It also\r\nextends far to the north, until it is buried and lost under the Pine\r\nValley Mountains, which are of volcanic origin.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what all this means. In order clearly to understand\r\nthis explanation the reader is referred to the illustration designated\r\n\"Section and Bird's-Eye View of the Plateaus North of the Grand Canyon.\"\r\nStarting at the Grand Wash on the west, the Grand Wash Cliffs, formed by\r\nthe Grand Wash Fault, are scaled; and if we are but a few miles north of\r\nthe Grand Canyon we are on the Shiwits Plateau. Its western boundary is\r\nthe Grand Wash Cliffs, its southern boundary is the Grand Canyon, and\r\nits northern boundary is a line of cliffs of degradation, which will\r\nbe described hereafter. Going eastward across the Shiwits Plateau the\r\nHurricane Cliffs are reached, and climbing them we are on the Uinkaret\r\nPlateau, which is bounded on the south by the Grand Canyon and on the\r\nnorth by the Vermilion Cliffs, that rise above its northern foot. Still\r\ngoing eastward 30 or 40 miles to the brink of the Kanab Canyon, the West\r\nKanab Plateau is crossed, which is bounded by the Toroweap Fault on the\r\nwest, separating it from the Uinkaret Plateau, and by the Kanab Canyon\r\non the east, with the Grand Canyon on the south and the Vermilion Cliffs\r\non the north. Crossing the Kanab, we are on the East Kanab Plateau,\r\nwhich extends about 30 miles to the foot of the West Kaibab Cliffs, or\r\nthe escarpment of the West Kaibab Fault. This canyon also has the Grand\r\nCanyon on the south and the Vermilion Cliffs on the north. Climbing\r\nthe West Kaibab Fault, we are on the Kaibab Plateau. Now we have been\r\nclimbing from west to east, and each ascent has been made at a line\r\nof cliffs. Crossing the Kaibab Plateau to the East Kaibab Cliffs;\r\nthe country falls down once more to the top of Marble Canyon Plateau.\r\nCrossing this plateau to the eastward, we at last reach the Echo Cliff\r\nFault, where the rocks fall down on the eastern side once more; but the\r\nsurface of the country itself does not fall down--the later rocks still\r\nremain, and the general level of the country is preserved except in\r\none feature of singular interest and beauty, to describe which a little\r\nfurther explanation is necessary.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of these north-and-south faults as if they were fractures;\r\nand usually they are fractures, but in some places they are flex-\r\n\r\n95 powell-canyons-59.jpg\r\n\r\nLAGOON ON THE KAIBAB.\r\n\r\n96 powell-canyons-60.jpg\r\n\r\nPINK CLIFFS, PAUNSAGUNT PLATEAU.\r\n\r\nCLIFFS AND TEEEACES. 97\r\n\r\nures. The Echo Cliffs displacement is a flexure. Just over the zone\r\nof flexure a long ridge extends from north to south, known as the Echo\r\nCliffs. It is composed of a comparatively hard and homogeneous sandstone\r\nof a later age than the limestones of the Marble Canyon Plateau west of\r\nit; but the flexure dips down so as to carry this sandstone which forms\r\nthe face of the cliff (presented westward) far under the surface, so\r\nthat on the east side rocks of still later age are found, the drop being\r\nseveral thousand feet. The inclined red sandstone stands in a ridge more\r\nthan 75 miles in length, with an escarped face presented to the west\r\nand a face of inclined rock to the east. The western side is carved into\r\nbeautiful alcoves and is buttressed with a magnificent talus, and the\r\nred sandstone stands in fractured columns of giant size and marvelous\r\nbeauty. On the east side the declining beds are carved into pockets,\r\nwhich often hold water. This is the region of the Thousand Wells. The\r\nfoot of the cliffs on the east side is several hundred feet above\r\nthe foot of the cliffs on the west side. On the west there is a vast\r\nlimestone stretch, the top of the Marble Canyon Plateau; on the east\r\nthere are drifting sand-dunes.\r\n\r\nThe terraced land described has three sets of terraces: one set on the\r\neast, great steps to the Kaibab Plateau; another set on the west, from\r\nthe Great Basin region to the Kaibab Plateau; and a third set from the\r\nGrand Canyon northward. There are thus three sets of cliffs: cliffs\r\nfacing the east, cliffs facing the west, and cliffs facing the south.\r\nThe north-and-south cliffs are made by faults; the east-and-west cliffs\r\nare made by differential degradation.\r\n\r\nThe stupendous cliffs by which the plateaus are bounded are of\r\nindescribable grandeur and beauty. The cliffs bounding the Kaibab\r\nPlateau descend on either side, and this is the culminating portion of\r\nthe region. All the other plateaus are terraces, with cliffs ascending\r\non the one side and descending on the other. Some of the tables carry\r\ndead volcanoes on their backs that are towering mountains, and all of\r\nthem are dissected by canyons that are gorges of profound depth. But\r\nevery one of these plateaus has characteristics peculiar to itself and\r\nis worthy of its own chapter. On the north there is a pair of plateaus,\r\ntwins in age, but very distinct in development, the Paunsagunt\r\nand Markagunt. They are separated by the Sevier River, which flows\r\nnorthward. Their\r\n\r\n98 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nsouthern margins constitute the highest steps of the great system of\r\nterraces of erosion. This escarpment is known as the Pink Cliffs. Above,\r\npine forests are found; below the cliffs are hills and sand-dunes. The\r\ncliffs themselves are bold and often vertical walls of a delicate pink\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nIn one of the earlier years of exploration I stood on the summit of the\r\nPink Cliffs of the Paunsagunt Plateau, 9,000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. Below me, to the southwest, I could look off into the canyons of\r\nthe Virgen River, down into the canyon of the Kanab, and far away into\r\nthe Grand Canyon of the Colorado. From the lowlands of the Great Basin\r\nand from the depths of the Grand Canyon clouds crept up over the cliffs\r\nand floated over the landscape below me, concealing the canyons and\r\nmantling the mountains and mesas and buttes; still on toward me the\r\nclouds rolled, burying the landscape in their progress, until at last\r\nthe region below was covered by a mantle of storm--a tumultuous sea of\r\nrolling clouds, black and angry in parts, white as the foam of cataracts\r\nhere and there, and everywhere flecked with resplendent sheen. Below me\r\nspread a vast ocean of vapor, for I was above the clouds. On descending\r\nto the plateau, I found that a great storm had swept the land, and the\r\ndry arroyos of the day before were the channels of a thousand streams\r\nof tawny water, born of the ocean of vapor which had invaded the land\r\nbefore my vision.\r\n\r\nBelow the Pink Cliffs another irregular zone of plateaus is found,\r\nstretching out to the margin of the Gray Cliffs. The Gray Cliffs are\r\ncomposed of a homogeneous sandstone which in some places weathers gray,\r\nbut in others is as white as virgin snow. On the top of these cliffs\r\nhills and sand-dunes are found, but everywhere on the Gray Cliff margin\r\nthe rocks are carved in fantastic forms; not in buttes and towers and\r\npinnacles, but in great rounded bosses of rock.\r\n\r\n98\r\n\r\nThe Virgen River heads back in the Pink Cliffs of the Markagunt Plateau\r\nand with its tributaries crosses one of these plateaus above the Gray\r\nCliffs, carving a labyrinth of deep gorges. This is known as the Colob\r\nPlateau. Above, there is a vast landscape of naked, white and gray\r\nsandstone, billowing in fantastic bosses. On the margins of the canyons\r\nthese are rounded off into great vertical walls, and at the bottom of\r\nevery winding canyon a beautiful stream of water is found\r\n\r\n99 powell-canyons-61.jpg\r\n\r\nA PERMIAN BUTTE.\r\n\r\n100 powell-canyons-62.jpg\r\n\r\nVERMILION CLIFFS AT KANAB.\r\n\r\nCLIFFS AND TERRACES. 101\r\n\r\nrunning over quicksands. Sometimes the streams in their curving have cut\r\nunder the rocks, and overhanging cliffs of towering altitudes are seen;\r\nand somber chambers are found between buttresses that uphold the walls.\r\nAmong the Indians this is known as the \"Rock Rovers' Land,\" and is\r\npeopled by mythic beings of uncanny traits.\r\n\r\nBelow the Gray Cliffs another zone of plateaus is found, separated by\r\nthe north-and-south faults and divided from the Colob series by the Gray\r\nCliffs and demarcated from the plateaus to the south by the Vermilion\r\nCliffs. The Vermilion Cliffs that face the south are of surpassing\r\nbeauty. The rocks are of orange and red above and of chocolate,\r\nlavender, gray, and brown tints below. The canyons that cut through\r\nthe cliffs from north to south are of great diversity and all are of\r\nprofound interest. In these canyon walls many caves are found, and\r\noften the caves contain lakelets and pools of clear water. Canyons\r\nand re-entrant angles abound. The faces of the cliffs are terraced and\r\nsalients project onto the floors below. The outlying buttes are many.\r\nStanding away to the south and facing these cliffs when the sun is going\r\ndown beyond the desert of the Great Basin, shadows are seen to creep\r\ninto the deep recesses, while the projecting forms are illumined, so\r\nthat the lights and shadows are in great and sharp contrast; then a\r\nmillion lights seem to glow from a background of black gloom, and a\r\ngreat bank of Tartarean fire stretches across the landscape.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Vermilion Cliffs there is everywhere a zone of\r\nvigorous junipers and piñons, for the belt of country is favored with\r\ncomparatively abundant rain. When the clouds drift over the plateaus\r\nbelow from the south and west and strike the Vermilion Cliffs, they are\r\nabruptly lifted 2,000 feet, and to make the climb they must unload their\r\nburdens; so that here copious rains are discharged, and by such storms\r\nthe cliffs are carved and ever from age to age carried back farther\r\nto the north. In the Pink Cliffs above and the Gray Cliffs and the\r\nVermilion Cliffs, there are many notches that mark channels running\r\nnorthward which had their sources on these plateaus when they extended\r\nfarther to the south. The Rio Virgen is the only stream heading in the\r\nPink Cliffs and running into the Colorado which is perennial. The other\r\nrivers and creeks carry streams of water in rainy seasons only. When a\r\nsuccession of dry years occurs the canyons coming through the\r\n\r\n102 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\ncliffs are choked below, as vast bodies of sand are deposited. But now\r\nand then, ten or twenty years apart, great storms or successions of\r\nstorms come, and the channels are flooded and cut their way again\r\nthrough the drifting sands to solid rock below. Thus the streams below\r\nare alternately choked and cleared from period to period.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the Vermilion Cliffs the last series or zone of plateaus\r\nnorth of the Grand Canyon is found. The summits of these plateaus are\r\nof cherty limestone. In the far west we have the Shiwits Plateau covered\r\nwith sheets of lava and volcanic cones; then climbing the Hurricane\r\nLedge we have the Kanab Plateau, on the southwest portion of which the\r\nUinkaret Mountains stand--a group of dead volcanoes with many black\r\ncinder cones scattered about. It is interesting to know how these\r\nmountains are formed. The first eruptions of lava were long ago, and\r\nthey were poured out upon a surface 2,000 feet or more higher than the\r\ngeneral surface now found. After the first eruptions of coulees the\r\nlands round about were degraded by rains and rivers. Then new eruptions\r\noccurred and additional sheets of lava were poured out; but these came\r\nnot through the first channels, but through later ones formed about the\r\nflanks of the elder beds of lava, so that the new sheets are imbricated\r\nor shingled over the old sheets. But the overlap is from below upward.\r\nThen the land was further degraded, and a third set of coulees was\r\nspread still lower down on the flanks, and on these last coulees the\r\nblack cinder cones stand. So the foundations of the Uinkaret Mountains\r\nare of limestones, and these foundations are covered with sheets of\r\nlava overlapping from below upward, and the last coulees are decked with\r\ncones.\r\n\r\nStill farther east is the Kaibab Plateau, the culminating table-land\r\nof the region. It is covered with a beautiful forest, and in the forest\r\ncharming parks are found. Its southern extremity is a portion of the\r\nwall of the Grand Canyon; its western margin is the wall of the West\r\nKaibab Fault; its eastern edge is the wall of the East Kaibab Fault;\r\nand its northern point is found where the two faults join. Here antelope\r\nfeed and many a deer goes bounding over the fallen timber. In winter\r\ndeep snows lie here, but the plateau has four months of the sweetest\r\nsummer man has ever known.\r\n\r\nOn the terraced plateaus three tribes of Indians are found: the Shiwits\r\n(\"people of the springs\"), the Uinkarets (\"people of the pine\r\n\r\n103 powell-canyons-63.jpg\r\n\r\nA MIDSUMMERDAY'S DREAM ON THE COLOB.\r\n\r\n104\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nmountains\"), and the Unkakaniguts (\"people of the red lands,\" who\r\ndwell along the Vermilion Cliffs). They are all Utes and belong to a\r\nconfederacy with other tribes living farther to the north, in Utah.\r\nThese people live in shelters made of boughs piled up in circles and\r\ncovered with juniper bark supported by poles. These little houses are\r\nonly large enough for half a dozen persons huddling together in sleep.\r\nTheir aboriginal clothing was very scant, the most important being\r\npowell-canyons-64.jpg\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nwildcatskin and wolfskin robes for the men, and rabbitskin robes for the\r\nwomen, though for occasions of festival they had clothing of tanned deer\r\nand antelope skins, often decorated with fantastic ornaments of snake\r\nskins, feathers, and the tails of squirrels and chipmunks. A great\r\nvariety of seeds and roots furnish their food, and on the higher\r\nplateaus there is much game, especially deer and antelope. But the whole\r\ncountry abounds with rabbits, which are often killed with arrows and\r\n\r\nCLIFFS AND TERRACES.\r\n\r\n105\r\n\r\ncaught in snares. Every year they have great hunts, when scores of\r\nrabbits are killed in a single day. It is managed in this way: They make\r\nnets of the fiber of the wild flax and of some other plant, the meshes\r\nof which are about an inch across. These nets are about three and a\r\nhalf feet in width and hundreds of yards in length. They arrange\r\npowell-canyons-65.jpg\r\n\r\nANTINAINTS, PUTUSIV, AND WICHUTS, IN FESTAL DRESS.\r\n\r\nsuch a net in a circle, not quite closed, supporting it by stakes and\r\npinning the bottom firmly to the ground. From the opening of the circle\r\nthey extend net wings, expanding in a broad angle several hundred yards\r\nfrom either side. Then the entire tribe will beat up a great district of\r\ncountry and drive the rabbits toward the nets, and finally into\r\n\r\n106\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthe circular snare, which is quickly closed, when the rabbits are killed\r\nwith arrows.\r\n\r\nA great variety of desert plants furnish them food, as seeds, roots, and\r\npowell-canyons-66.jpg\r\n\r\nPERSPECTIVE VIEW OF TYPICAL SOLITARY HOUSE.\r\n\r\nstalks. More than fifty varieties of such seed-bearing plants have been\r\ncollected. The seeds themselves are roasted, ground, and preserved\r\nin cakes. The most abundant food of this nature is derived from the\r\nsunflower and the nuts of the piñón. They still make stone arrowheads,\r\nstone knives, and stone hammers, and kindle fire with the drill. Their\r\nmedicine men are famous sorcerers. Coughs are caused by invisible winged\r\ninsects, rheumatism by flesh-eating bugs too small to be seen, and the\r\ntoothache by invisible worms. Their healing art consists in searing and\r\nscarifying. Their medicine men take the medicine themselves to produce\r\na state of ecstasy, in which the disease pests are discovered. They also\r\npractice dancing about their patients to drive away the evil beings or\r\nto avert the effects of sorcery. When a child is bitten by a rattlesnake\r\nthe snake is caught and brought near to the suffering urchin, and\r\nceremonies are performed, all for the purpose of prevailing upon the\r\nsnake to take back the evil spirit. They have quite a variety of mythic\r\npersonages. The chief of these are the\r\n\r\nCLIFFS AND TEBEACES.\r\n\r\n107\r\n\r\nEnupits, who are pigmies dwelling about the springs, and the Rock\r\nRovers, who live in the cliffs. Their gods are zoic, and the chief among\r\nthem are the wolf, the rabbit, the eagle, the jay, the rattlesnake, and\r\nthe spider. They have no knowledge of the ambient air, but the winds\r\nare the breath of beasts living in the four quarters of the earth.\r\nWhirlwinds that often blow among the sand-dunes are caused by the\r\ndancing of Enupits. The sky is ice, and the rain is caused by the\r\nRainbow God; he abraids the ice of the sky with his scales and the snow\r\nfalls, and if the weather be warm the ice melts and it is rain. The sun\r\nis a poor slave compelled to make the same journey every day since he\r\nwas conquered by the rabbit. These tribes have a great body of romance,\r\nin which the actors are animals, and the knowledge of these stories is\r\nthe lore of their sages.\r\n\r\nScattered over the plateaus are the ruins of many ancient stone pueblos,\r\nnot unlike those previously described.\r\n\r\nThe Kanab River heading in the Pink Cliffs runs directly southward\r\npowell-canyons-67.jpg\r\n\r\nPERSPECTIVE VIEW OP ROUND-HOUSE STRUCTURE OF LAVA.\r\n\r\nand joins the Colorado in the heart of the Grand Canyon. Its way is\r\nthrough a series of canyons. From one of these it emerges at the foot\r\nof the Vermilion Cliffs, and here stood an extensive ruin not many years\r\nago. Some portions of the pueblo were three stories\r\n\r\n108\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nhigh. The structure was one of the best found in this land of ruins. The\r\nMormon people settling here have used the stones of the old pueblo\r\nin building their homes, and now no vestiges of the ancient structure\r\nremain. A few miles below the town other ruins were found. They were\r\nscattered to Pipe's Springs, a point twenty miles to the westward.\r\nRuins were also discovered up the stream as far as the Pink Cliffs, and\r\neastward along the Vermilion Cliffs nearly to the Colorado River, and\r\nout on the margin of the Kanab Plateau. These were all ruins of outlying\r\nhabitations be-longing to the Kanab pueblo. From the study of the\r\nexisting pueblos found elsewhere and from extensive study of the ruins,\r\nit seems that everywhere tribal pueblos were built of considerable\r\ndimensions, usually to give shelter to several hundred people. Then the\r\npeople cultivated the soil by irrigation, and had powell-canyons-68.jpg\r\n\r\nAN ANCIENT CLIFF HOUSE.\r\n\r\n109 powell-canyons-69.jpg\r\n\r\nA ZUÑI EAGLE CAGE.\r\n\r\n110 powell-canyons-70.jpg\r\n\r\nA VIEW OF ZUÑI.\r\n\r\n111\r\n\r\nCLIFFS AND TERRACES.\r\n\r\ntheir gardens and little fields scattered at wide distances about the\r\ncentral pueblo, by little springs and streams and wherever they could\r\ncontrol the water with little labor to bring it on the land. At such\r\npoints stone houses were erected sufficient to accommodate from one\r\nto two thousand people, and these were occupied during the season of\r\ncultivation and are known as rancherías. So one great tribe had its\r\ncentral pueblo and its outlying rancherías. Sometimes the rancherías\r\nwere occupied from year to year, especially in time of peace, but\r\nusually they were occupied only during seasons of cultivation. Such\r\ngroups of ruins and pueblos with accessory rancherías are still\r\ninhabited, and have been described as found throughout the Plateau\r\nProvince except far to the north beyond the Uinta Mountains. A great\r\npueblo once existed in the Uinta Valley on the south side of the\r\nmountains. This is the most northern pueblo which has yet been\r\ndiscovered. But the pueblo-building tribes extended beyond the area\r\ndrained by the Colorado. On the west there was a pueblo in the Great\r\nBasin at the site now occupied by Salt Lake City, and several more to\r\nthe southward, all on waters flowing into the desert. On the east such\r\npueblos were found among mountains at the headwaters of the Arkansas,\r\nPlatte, and Canadian rivers. The entire area drained by the Rio\r\nGrande del Norte was occupied by pueblo tribes, and a number are still\r\ninhabited. To the south they extended far beyond the territory of the\r\nUnited States, and the so-called Aztec cities were rather superior\r\npueblos of this character. The known pueblo tribes of the United States\r\nbelong to several different linguistic stocks. They are far from being\r\none homogeneous people, for they have not only different languages but\r\ndifferent religions and worship different gods. These pueblo peoples\r\nare in a higher grade of culture than most Indian tribes of the United\r\nStates. This is exhibited in the slight superiority of their arts,\r\nespecially in their architecture. It is also noticeable in their\r\nmythology and religion. Their gods, the heroes of their myths, are more\r\noften personifications of the powers and phenomena of nature, and their\r\nreligious ceremonies are more elaborate, and their cult societies\r\nare highly organized. As they had begun to domesticate animals and\r\nto cultivate the soil, so as to obtain a part of their subsistence by\r\nagriculture, they had almost accomplished the ascent from savagery\r\n\r\n112 powell-canyons-71.jpg\r\n\r\nWALPI DANCE ROCK.\r\n\r\nCLIFFS AND TERRACES. 113\r\n\r\nto barbarism when first discovered by the invading European. All the\r\nIndians of North America were in this state of transition, but the\r\npueblo tribes had more nearly reached the higher goal.\r\n\r\nThe great number of ruins found throughout the land has often been\r\ninterpreted as evidence of a much larger pueblo population than has been\r\nfound in post-Columbian time. But a careful study of the facts does not\r\nwarrant this conclusion. It would seem that for various reasons tribes\r\nabandoned old pueblos and built new, thus changing their permanent\r\nresidence from time to time; but more frequent changes were made in\r\ntheir rancherias. These were but ephemeral, being moved from place to\r\nplace by the varying conditions of water supply. Most of the streams of\r\nthe arid land are not perennial, but very many of the smaller streams\r\nof the pueblo region discharge their waters into the larger streams\r\nin times of great flood. Such floods occur now here, now there, and at\r\nvarying periods, sometimes fifty years apart. When dry years follow one\r\nanother for a long series, the channels of these intermittent streams\r\nare choked with sand until the streams are buried and lost. Under such\r\ncircumstances the rancherias were moved from dead stream to living\r\nstream. In rare instances pueblos themselves were removed for this\r\ncause. Other pueblos, and the rancherias generally, were abandoned in\r\ntime of war; this seems to have been a potent cause for moving. When\r\npestilence attacked a pueblo the people would sometimes leave in a body\r\nand never return. The cliff pueblos and dwellings, the cavate dwellings,\r\nand the cinder-cone towns were all built and occupied for defensive\r\npurposes when powerful enemies threatened. The history of some of the\r\nold ruins has been obtained and we know the existing tribes who once\r\noccupied them; others still remain enshrouded in obscurity.\r\n\r\n114 powell-canyons-72.jpg\r\n\r\nA PASSAGEWAY IN WALPI.\r\n\r\n115\r\n\r\nTHE HURRICANE FAULT. powell-canyons-73.jpg\r\n\r\nTOWERS OF THE VERMILION CLIFFS.\r\n\r\n116 powell-canyons-74.jpg\r\n\r\nTEMPLES AND TOWERS OF THE RIO VIRGEN.\r\n\r\n117 powell-canyons-75.jpg\r\n\r\nPANORAMA.

While in Middle Park I explored a little canyon through which\r\nthe Grand River runs, immediately below the now well-known watering\r\nplace, Middle Park Hot Springs. Later in the fall I passed through Cedar\r\nCanyon, the gorge by which the Grand leaves the park. A result of the\r\nsummer's study was to kindle a desire to explore the canyons of the\r\nGrand, Green, and Colorado rivers, and the next summer I organized an\r\nexpedition with the intention of penetrating still farther into that\r\ncanyon country.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the snows were melted, so that the main range could be\r\ncrossed, I went over into Middle Park, and proceeded thence down the\r\nGrand to the head of Cedar Canyon, then across the Park Range by Gore's\r\nPass, and in October found myself and party encamped on the White\r\nRiver, about 120 miles above its mouth. At that point I built cabins and\r\nestablished winter quarters, intending to occupy the cold season, as far\r\nas possible, in exploring the adjacent country. The winter of 1868-69\r\nproved favorable to my purposes, and several excursions were made,\r\nsouthward to the Grand, down the White to the Green, northward to the\r\nYampa, and around the Uinta Mountains. During these several excursions I\r\nseized every opportunity to study the canyons through which these upper\r\nstreams run, and while thus engaged formed plans for the exploration\r\nof the canyons of the Colorado. Since that time I have been engaged in\r\nexecuting these plans, sometimes employed in the field, sometimes in\r\nthe office. Begun originally as an exploration, the work was finally\r\ndeveloped into a survey, embracing the geography, geology, ethnography,\r\nand natural\r\n\r\n121 powell-canyons-78.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE START FROM GREEN RIVER STATION.\r\n\r\nFROM GREEN RIVER CITY TO FLAMING GORGE.\r\n\r\nhistory of the country, and a number of gentlemen have, from time to\r\ntime, assisted me in the work.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1869 a party was organized for the exploration of\r\nthe canyons. Boats were built in Chicago and transported by rail to the\r\npoint where the Union Pacific Railroad crosses the Green River. With\r\nthese we were to descend the Green to the Colorado, and the Colorado\r\ndown to the foot of the Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\nMay 24, 1869.--The good people of Green River City turn out to see us\r\nstart. We raise our little flag, push the boats from shore, and the\r\nswift current carries us down.\r\n\r\nOur boats are four in number. Three are built of oak; stanch and\r\nfirm; double-ribbed, with double stem and stern posts, and further\r\nstrengthened by bulkheads, dividing each into three compartments. Two of\r\nthese, the fore and aft, are decked, forming water-tight cabins. It is\r\nexpected these will buoy the boats should the waves roll over them in\r\nrough water. The fourth boat is made of pine, very light, but 16 feet in\r\nlength, with a sharp cutwater, and every way built for fast rowing, and\r\ndivided into compartments as the others. The little vessels are 21 feet\r\nlong, and, taking out the cargoes, can be carried by four men.\r\n\r\nWe take with us rations deemed sufficient to last ten months, for we\r\nexpect, when winter comes on and the river is filled with ice, to lie\r\nover at some point until spring arrives; and so we take with us abundant\r\nsupplies of clothing, likewise. We have also a large quantity of\r\nammunition and two or three dozen traps. For the purpose of building\r\ncabins, repairing boats, and meeting other exigencies, we are supplied\r\nwith axes, hammers, saws, augers, and other tools, and a quantity\r\nof nails and screws. For scientific work, we have two sextants, four\r\nchronometers, a number of barometers, thermometers, compasses, and other\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThe flour is divided into three equal parts; the meat, and all other\r\narticles of our rations, in the same way. Each of the larger boats has\r\nan axe, hammer, saw, auger, and other tools, so that all are loaded\r\nalike. We distribute the cargoes in this way that we may not be entirely\r\ndestitute of some important article should any one of the boats be lost.\r\nIn the small boat we pack a part of the scientific\r\n\r\n122\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\ninstruments, three guns, and three small bundles of clothing, only; and\r\nin this I proceed in advance to explore the channel.\r\n\r\nJ. C. Sumner and William H. Dunn are my boatmen in the \"Emma Dean\";\r\nthen follows \"Kitty Clyde's Sister,\" manned by W. H. Powell and G. Y.\r\nBradley; next, the \"No Name,\" with O. G. Howland, Seneca Howland, and\r\nFrank Goodman; and last comes the \"Maid of the Canyon,\" with W. E.\r\nHawkins and Andrew Hall.\r\n\r\nSumner was a soldier during the late war, and before and since that time\r\nhas been a great traveler in the wilds of the Mississippi Valley and\r\nthe Rocky Mountains as an amateur hunter. He is a fair-haired,\r\ndelicate-looking man, but a veteran in experience, and has performed the\r\nfeat of crossing the Rocky Mountains in midwinter on snowshoes. He\r\nspent the winter of 1886-87 in Middle Park, Colorado, for the purpose of\r\nmaking some natural history collections for me, and succeeded in killing\r\nthree grizzlies, two mountain lions, and a large number of elk, deer,\r\nsheep, wolves, beavers, and many other animals. When Bayard Taylor\r\ntraveled through the parks of Colorado, Sumner was his guide, and he\r\nspeaks in glowing terms of Mr. Taylor's genial qualities in camp, but\r\nhe was mortally offended when the great traveler requested him to act as\r\ndoorkeeper at Breckenridge to receive the admission fee from those who\r\nattended his lectures.\r\n\r\nDunn was a hunter, trapper, and mule-packer in Colorado for many years.\r\nHe dresses in buckskin with a dark oleaginous luster, doubtless due to\r\nthe fact that he has lived on fat venison and killed many beavers since\r\nhe first donned his uniform years ago. His raven hair falls down to his\r\nback, for he has a sublime contempt of shears and razors.\r\n\r\nCaptain Powell was an officer of artillery during the late war and\r\nwas captured on the 22d day of July, 1864, at Atlanta and served a ten\r\nmonths' term in prison at Charleston, where he was placed with other\r\nofficers under fire. He is silent, moody, and sarcastic, though\r\nsometimes he enlivens the camp at night with a song. He is never\r\nsurprised at anything, his coolness never deserts him, and he would\r\nchoke the belching throat of a volcano if he thought the spitfire meant\r\nanything but fun. We call him \"Old Shady.\"\r\n\r\nBradley, a lieutenant during the late war, and since orderly sergeant\r\n\r\nFROM GREEN RIVER CITY TO FLAMING GORGE.\r\n\r\nin the regular army, was, a few weeks previous to our start, discharged,\r\nby order of the Secretary of War, that he might go on this trip. He\r\nis scrupulously careful, and a little mishap works him into a passion,\r\npowell-canyons-79.jpg\r\n\r\nVIEW IN SICHUMOVI.\r\n\r\nbut when labor is needed he has a ready hand and powerful arm, and in\r\ndanger, rapid judgment and unerring skill. A great difficulty or\r\nperil changes the petulant spirit into a brave, generous soul.\r\npowell-canyons-80.jpg\r\n\r\nTRAIL UP WALPI MESA.\r\n\r\nFROM GREEN EIVER CITY TO FLAMING GORGE.\r\n\r\n123\r\n\r\nO. G. Howland is a printer by trade, an editor by profession, and a\r\nhunter by choice. When busily employed he usually puts his hat in his\r\npocket, and his thin hair and long beard stream in the wind, giving\r\nhim a wild look, much like that of King Lear in an illustrated copy of\r\nShakespeare which tumbles around the camp.\r\n\r\nSeneca Howland is a quiet, pensive young man, and a great favorite with\r\nall.\r\n\r\nGoodman is a stranger to us--a stout, willing Englishman, with\r\nflorid face and more florid anticipations of a glorious trip.\r\npowell-canyons-81.jpg\r\n\r\nRIDGES ON BITTER CREEK.\r\n\r\nBilly Hawkins, the cook, was a soldier in the Union Army during the\r\nwar, and when discharged at its close went West, and since then has been\r\nengaged as teamster on the plains or hunter in the mountains. He is\r\nan athlete and a jovial good fellow, who hardly seems to know his own\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nHall is a Scotch boy, nineteen years old, with what seems to us a\r\n\"secondhand head,\" which doubtless came down to him from some knight who\r\nwore it during the Border Wars. It looks a very old head indeed,\r\nwith deep-set blue eyes and beaked nose. Young as he is, Hall has had\r\nexperience in hunting, trapping, and fighting Indians, and he makes the\r\nmost of it, for he can tell a good story, and is never encumbered by\r\nunnecessary scruples in giving to his narratives those embellishments\r\nwhich help to make a story complete. He is always ready for work or play\r\nand is a good hand at either.\r\n\r\nOur boats are heavily loaded, and only with the utmost care is it pos-\r\n\r\n124\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nsible to float in the rough river without shipping water. A mile or two\r\nbelow town we run on a sandbar. The men jump into the stream and\r\nthus lighten the vessels, so that they drift over, and on we go.\r\npowell-canyons-82.jpg\r\n\r\nMESAS.\r\n\r\nIn trying to avoid a rock an oar is broken on one of the boats, and,\r\nthus crippled, she strikes. The current is swift and she is sent reeling\r\nand rocking into the eddy. In the confusion two other oars are lost\r\noverboard, and the men seem quite discomfited, much to the amusement of\r\nthe other members of the party. Catching the oars and starting again,\r\nthe boats are once more borne down the stream, until we land at a small\r\ncottonwood grove on the bank and camp for noon.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon we run down to a point where the river sweeps the\r\nfoot of an overhanging cliff, and here we camp for the night. The sun\r\nis yet two hours high, so I climb the cliffs and walk back among\r\nthe strangely carved rocks of the Green River bad lands. These are\r\nsandstones and shales, gray and buff, red and brown, blue and black\r\nstrata in many alternations, lying nearly horizontal, and almost without\r\nsoil and vegetation. They are very friable, and the rain and streams\r\nhave carved them into quaint shapes. Barren desolation is stretched\r\nbefore me; and yet there is a beauty in the scene.

Away to the south the Uinta Mountains stretch in a long\r\nline,--high peaks thrust into the sky, and snow fields glittering like\r\nlakes of molten silver, and pine forests in somber green, and rosy\r\nclouds playing around the borders of huge, black masses; and heights\r\nand clouds and mountains and snow fields and forests and rock-lands\r\nare blended into one grand view. Now the sun goes down, and I return to\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nMay 25.--We start early this morning and run along at a good\r\npowell-canyons-83.jpg\r\n\r\nA VALLEY WEST OF GREEN RIVER.\r\n\r\nrate until about nine o'clock, when we are brought up on a gravelly bar.\r\nAll jump out and help the boats over by main strength.

When the clouds \"get out of our\r\nsunshine\" we start again. A few miles farther down a flock of mountain\r\nsheep are seen on a cliff to the right. The boats are quietly tied\r\nup and three or four men go after them. In the course of two\r\npowell-canyons-84.jpg\r\n\r\nALCOVE LANDS.\r\n\r\nor three hours they return. The cook has been successful in bringing\r\ndown a fat lamb. The unsuccessful hunters taunt him with finding it\r\ndead; but it is soon dressed, cooked, and eaten, and makes a fine four\r\no'clock dinner.\r\n\r\n\"All aboard,\" and down the river for another dozen miles. On the way\r\nwe pass the mouth of Black's Fork, a dirty little stream that seems\r\nsomewhat swollen. Just below its mouth we land and camp.\r\n\r\nMay 26.--To-day we pass several curiously shaped buttes, standing\r\nbetween the west bank of the river and the high bluffs beyond. These\r\nbuttes are outliers of the same beds of rocks as are exposed on the\r\nfaces of the bluffs,--thinly laminated shales and sandstones of many\r\ncolors, standing above in vertical cliffs and buttressed below with a\r\nwater-carved talus; some of them attain an altitude of nearly a thousand\r\nfeet above the level of the river.\r\n\r\nFROM GREEN RIVER CITY TO FLAMING GORGE.\r\n\r\n127\r\n\r\nWe glide quietly down the placid stream past the carved cliffs of the\r\nmauvaises terres, now and then obtaining glimpses of distant mountains.\r\nOccasionally, deer are started from the glades among the willows; and\r\nseveral wild geese, after a chase through the water, are shot. After\r\ndinner we pass through a short and narrow canyon into a broad valley;\r\nfrom this, long, lateral valleys stretch back on either side as far as\r\nthe eye can reach.\r\n\r\nTwo or three miles below, Henry's Fork enters from the right. We land\r\na short distance above the junction, where a cache of instruments and\r\nrations was made several months ago in a cave at the foot of the cliff,\r\na distance back from the river. Here they were safe from the elements\r\nand wild beasts, but not from man. Some anxiety is powell-canyons-85.jpg\r\n\r\nBAD LANDS.\r\n\r\nfelt, as we have learned that a party of Indians have been camped near\r\nthe place for several weeks. Our fears are soon allayed, for we find the\r\ncache undisturbed. Our chronometer wheels have not been taken for hair\r\nornaments, our barometer tubes for beads, or the sextant thrown into the\r\nriver as \"bad medicine,\" as had been predicted. Taking up our cache, we\r\npass down to the foot of the Uinta Mountains and in a cold storm go into\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n128\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nThe river is running to the south; the mountains have an easterly and\r\nwesterly trend directly athwart its course, yet it glides on in a quiet\r\nway as if it thought a mountain range no formidable obstruction. It\r\nenters the range by a flaring, brilliant red gorge, that may be\r\nseen from the north a score of miles away. The great mass of the\r\npowell-canyons-86.jpg\r\n\r\nOUR INDIAN GUIDE.\r\n\r\nmountain ridge through which the gorge is cut is composed of bright\r\nvermilion rocks; but they are surmounted by broad bands of mottled buff\r\nand gray, and these bands come down with a gentle curve to the water's\r\nedge on the nearer slope of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThis is the head of the first of the canyons we are about to explore--an\r\nintroductory one to a series made by the river through this\r\n\r\nFROM GREEN RIVER CITY TO FLAMING GORGE.\r\n\r\n129\r\n\r\nrange.

It is a delicate task to do this without breaking\r\nthe glass; but we have success, and are ready to measure mountains once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMay 28.--To-day we go to the summit of the cliff on the left and take\r\nobservations for altitude, and are variously employed in topographic and\r\ngeologic work.\r\n\r\n130\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nMay 29.--This morning Bradley and I cross the river and climb more than\r\na thousand feet to a point where we can see the stream sweeping in a\r\nlong, beautiful curve through the gorge below. Turning and looking to\r\nthe west, we can see the valley of Henry's Fork, through which, for many\r\nmiles, the little river flows in a tortuous channel. Cottonwood groves\r\nare planted here and there along its course, and between them are\r\nstretches of grass land. The narrow mountain valley is inclosed on\r\neither side by sloping walls of naked rock of many powell-canyons-88.jpg\r\n\r\nGREEN RIVER PLAINS.\r\n\r\nbright colors. To the south of the valley are the Uintas, and the peaks\r\nof the Wasatch Mountains can be faintly seen in the far west. To the\r\nnorth, desert plains, dotted here and there with curiously carved hills\r\nand buttes, extend to the limit of vision.\r\n\r\nFor many years this valley has been the home of a number of\r\nmountaineers, who were originally hunters and trappers, living with the\r\nIndians. Most of them have one or more Indian wives. They no longer\r\nroam with the nomadic tribes in pursuit of buckskin or beaver, but have\r\naccumulated herds of cattle and horses, and consider themselves quite\r\nwell to do. Some of them have built cabins; others\r\n\r\nFROM GREEN RIVER CITY TO FLAMING GORGE.\r\n\r\n131\r\n\r\nstill live in lodges. John Baker is one of the most famous of these men,\r\nand from our point of view we can see his lodge, three or four miles up\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Green River City to Flaming Gorge is 62 miles. The\r\nriver runs between bluffs, in some places standing so close to each\r\nother that no flood plain is seen. At such a point the river might\r\nproperly be said to run through a canyon. The bad lands on either side\r\nare interrupted here and there by patches of Artemisia, or sage brush.\r\nWhere there is a flood plain along either side of the river, a few\r\ncottonwoods may be seen. powell-canyons-89.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE CHIEF KIVA OF SHUPAULOVI.\r\n\r\n132 powell-canyons-90.jpg\r\n\r\nWALPI.\r\n\r\n133\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFROM FLAMING GORGE TO THE GATE OF LODORE.\r\n\r\nONE must not think of a mountain range as a line of peaks standing on a\r\nplain, but as a broad platform many miles wide from which mountains have\r\nbeen carved by the waters. One must conceive, too, that this plateau is\r\ncut by gulches and canyons in many directions and that beautiful valleys\r\nare scattered about at different altitudes. The first series of canyons\r\nwe are about to explore constitutes a river channel through such a range\r\nof mountains. The canyon is cut nearly halfway through the range, then\r\nturns to the east and is cut along the central line, or axis, gradually\r\ncrossing it to the south. Keeping this direction for more than 50\r\nmiles, it then turns abruptly to a southwest course, and goes diagonally\r\nthrough the southern slope of the range.\r\n\r\nThis much we know before entering, as we made a partial exploration of\r\nthe region last fall, climbing many of its peaks, and in a few places\r\nreaching the brink of the canyon walls and looking over precipices many\r\nhundreds of feet high to the water below.\r\n\r\nHere and there the walls are broken by lateral canyons, the channels\r\nof little streams entering the river. Through two or three of these we\r\nfound our way down to the Green in early winter and walked along the low\r\nwater-beach at the foot of the cliffs for several miles. Where the river\r\nhas this general easterly direction the western part only has cut for\r\nitself a canyon, while the eastern has formed a broad valley, called, in\r\nhonor of an old-time trapper, Brown's Park, and long known as a favorite\r\nwinter resort for mountain men and Indians.\r\n\r\nMay 30.--This morning we are ready to enter the mysterious canyon, and\r\nstart with some anxiety. The old mountaineers tell us that it cannot be\r\nrun; the Indians say, \"Water heap catch 'em\"; but all are eager for the\r\ntrial, and off we go.\r\n\r\n134\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nEntering Flaming Gorge, we quickly run through it on a swift current and\r\nemerge into a little park. Half a mile below, the river wheels sharply\r\nto the left and enters another canyon cut into the mountain. We enter\r\nthe narrow passage. On either side the walls rapidly increase in\r\naltitude. On the left are overhanging ledges and cliffs,--500, 1,000,\r\n1,500 feet high.\r\n\r\nOn the right the rocks are broken and ragged, and the water fills the\r\nchannel from cliff to cliff. Now the river turns abruptly around a point\r\nto the right, and the waters plunge swiftly down among great rocks; and\r\nhere we have our first experience with canyon rapids. I stand up on the\r\ndeck of my boat to seek a way among the wave-beaten rocks. All untried\r\nas we are with such waters, the moments are filled with intense anxiety.\r\nSoon our boats reach the swift current; a stroke or two, now on this.\r\nside, now on that, and we thread the narrow passage with exhilarating\r\nVelocity, mounting the high waves, whose foaming crests dash over us,\r\nand plunging into the troughs, until we reach the quiet water below.\r\nThen comes a feeling of great relief. Our first rapid is run. Another\r\nmile, and we come into the valley again. powell-canyons-91.jpg\r\n\r\nCAMP AT FLAMING GORGE\r\n\r\n135 powell-canyons-92.jpg\r\n\r\nMASHONGNAVI, WITH SHUPAULOVI IN THE DISTANCE.\r\n\r\n136 powell-canyons-93.jpg\r\n\r\nHORSESHOE CANYON.\r\n\r\nFROM FLAMING GORGE TO THE GATE OF LODORE. 137\r\n\r\nLet me explain this canyon. Where the river turns to the left above,\r\nit takes a course directly into the mountain, penetrating to its very\r\nheart, then wheels back upon itself, and runs out into the valley from\r\nwhich it started only half a mile below the point at which it entered;\r\nso the canyon is in the form of an elongated letter U, with the apex in\r\nthe center of the mountain. We name it Horseshoe Canyon.\r\n\r\nSoon we leave the valley and enter another short canyon, very narrow at\r\nfirst, but widening below as the canyon walls increase in height. Here\r\nwe discover the mouth of a beautiful little creek coming down through\r\nits narrow water-worn cleft. Just at its entrance there is a park of two\r\nor three hundred acres, walled on every side by almost vertical cliffs\r\nhundreds of feet in altitude, with three gateways through the walls--one\r\nup the river, another down, and a third through which the creek comes\r\nin. The river is broad, deep, and quiet, and its waters mirror towering\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nKingfishers are playing about the streams, and so we adopt as names\r\nKingfisher Creek, Kingfisher Park, and Kingfisher Canyon. At night we\r\ncamp at the foot of this canyon.\r\n\r\nOur general course this day has been south, but here the river turns to\r\nthe east around a point which is rounded to the shape of a dome. On its\r\nsides little cells have been carved by the action of the water, and in\r\nthese pits, which cover the face of the dome, hundreds of swallows have\r\nbuilt their nests. As they flit about the cliffs, they look like swarms\r\nof bees, giving to the whole the appearance of a colossal beehive of the\r\nold-time form, and so we name it Beehive Point.\r\n\r\nThe opposite wall is a vast amphitheater, rising in a succession of\r\nterraces to a height of 1,200 or 1,500 feet. Each step is built of\r\nred sandstone, with a face of naked red rock and a glacis clothed with\r\nverdure. So the amphitheater seems banded red and green, and the evening\r\nsun is playing with roseate flashes on the rocks, with shimmering green\r\non the cedars' spray, and with iridescent gleams on the dancing waves.\r\nThe landscape revels in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nMay 31.--We start down another canyon and reach rapids made dangerous by\r\nhigh rocks lying in the channel; so we run ashore and let our boats down\r\nwith lines. In the afternoon we come to more dangerous rapids and stop\r\nto examine them. I find we must do the same work\r\n\r\n138 8 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nagain, but, being on the wrong side of the river to obtain a foothold,\r\nmust first cross over--no very easy matter in such a current, with\r\nrapids and rocks below. We take the pioneer boat, \"Emma Dean,\" over, and\r\nunload her on the bank; then she returns and takes another load. Running\r\nback and forth, she soon has half our cargo over. Then one of the larger\r\nboats is manned and taken across, but is carried down almost to the\r\nrocks in spite of hard rowing. The other boats follow and make the\r\nlanding, and we go into camp for the night.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the cliff on this side there is a long slope covered with\r\npines; under these we make our beds, and soon after sunset are seeking\r\nrest and sleep. The cliffs on either side are of red sandstone and\r\nstretch toward the heavens 2,500 feet. On this side the long, pine-clad\r\nslope is surmounted by perpendicular cliffs, with pines on their\r\nsummits. The wall on the other side is bare rock from the water's edge\r\nup 2,000 feet, then slopes back, giving footing to pines and cedars.\r\n\r\nAs the twilight deepens, the rocks grow dark and somber; the threatening\r\nroar of the water is loud and constant, and I lie awake with thoughts\r\nof the morrow and the canyons to come, interrupted now and then by\r\ncharacteristics of the scenery that attract my attention. And here I\r\nmake a discovery. On looking at the mountain directly in front, the\r\nsteepness of the slope is greatly exaggerated, while the distance to\r\nits summit and its true altitude are correspondingly diminished. I have\r\nheretofore found that to judge properly of the slope of a mountain side,\r\none must see it in profile. In coming down the river this afternoon, I\r\nobserved the slope of a particular part of the wall and made an estimate\r\nof its altitude. While at supper, I noticed the same cliff from a\r\nposition facing it, and it seemed steeper, but not half so high. Now\r\nlying on my side and looking at it, the true proportions appear. This\r\nseems a wonder, and I rise to take a view of it standing. It is the same\r\ncliff as at supper time. Lying down again, it is the cliff as seen in\r\nprofile, with a long slope and distant summit. Musing on this, I forget\r\n\"the morrow and the canyons to come\"; I have found a way to estimate the\r\naltitude and slope of an inclination, in like manner as I can judge of\r\ndistance along the horizon. The reason is simple. A reference to the\r\nstereoscope will\r\n\r\nFROM FLAMING GOEGE TO THE GATE OF LODOEE.\r\n\r\n139\r\n\r\nsuggest it. The distance between the eyes forms a base line for optical\r\ntriangulation.\r\n\r\nJune 1.--To-day we have an exciting ride. The river rolls down the\r\ncanyon at a wonderful rate, and, with no rocks in the way, we make\r\n\r\n140 powell-canyons-94.jpg\r\n\r\nSCENE IN HAND.\r\n\r\nalmost railroad speed. Here and there the water rushes into a narrow\r\ngorge; the rocks on the side roll it into the center in great waves,\r\nand the boats go leaping and bounding over these like things of life,\r\nreminding me of scenes witnessed in Middle Park--herds of startled deer\r\nbounding through forests beset with fallen timber. I\r\n\r\n140 powell-canyons-95.jpg\r\n\r\nPESCADO PUEBLO----OUTSIDE STEPS.\r\n\r\nFROM FLAMING GORGE TO THE GATE OF LODORE.\r\n\r\n141\r\n\r\nmention the resemblance to some of the hunters, and so striking is it\r\nthat the expression, \"See the blacktails jumping the logs,\" comes to be\r\na common one. At times the waves break and roll over the boats, which\r\nnecessitates much bailing and obliges us to stop occasionally for that\r\npurpose. At one time we run twelve miles in an hour, stoppages included.\r\n\r\nLast spring I had a conversation with an old Indian named Páriate,\r\nwho told me about one of his tribe attempting to run this canyon. \"The\r\nrocks,\" he said, holding his hands above his head, his arms vertical,\r\nand looking between them to the heavens, \"the rocks h-e-a-p,\r\npowell-canyons-96.jpg\r\n\r\nOVEN NEAR PESCADO PUEBLO.\r\n\r\nh-e-a-p high; the water go h-oo-woogh, h-oo-woogh; water-pony li-e-a-p\r\nbuck; water catch 'em; no see 'em Injun any more! no see 'em squaw any\r\nmore! no see 'em papoose any more!\"\r\n\r\nThose who have seen these wild Indian ponies rearing alternately before\r\nand behind, or \"bucking,\" as it is called in the vernacular, will\r\nappreciate his description.\r\n\r\nAt last we come to calm water, and a threatening roar is heard in the\r\ndistance. Slowly approaching the point whence the sound issues, we come\r\nnear to falls, and tie up just above them on the left. Here we shall be\r\ncompelled to make a portage; so we unload the boats,\r\n\r\n142\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO. powell-canyons-97.jpg\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE ANDIRON IN SHUMOPAVI.\r\n\r\nand fasten a long line to the bow of the smaller one, and another to the\r\nstern, and moor her close to the brink of the fall. Then the bowline is\r\ntaken below and made fast; the stern line is held by five or six men,\r\nand the boat let down as long as they can hold her against the rushing\r\nwaters; then, letting go one end of the line, it runs through the ring;\r\nthe boat leaps over the fall and is caught by the lower rope.\r\n\r\nNow we rest for the night.\r\n\r\nJune 2.--This morning we make a trail among the rocks, transport the\r\ncargoes to a point below the fall, let the remaining boats over, and are\r\nready to start before noon.\r\n\r\nOn a high rock by which the trail passes we find the inscription:\r\n\"Ashley 18-5.\" The third figure is obscure--some of the party reading\r\nit 1835, some 1855. James Baker, an old-time mountaineer, once told me\r\nabout a party of men starting down the river, and Ashley was\r\n\r\nFROM FLAMING GORGE TO THE GATE OF LODORE.\r\n\r\n143\r\n\r\nnamed as one. The story runs that the boat was swamped, and some of\r\nthe party drowned in one of the canyons below. The word \"Ashley\" is a\r\nwarning to us, and we resolve on great caution. Ashley Falls is the name\r\nwe give to the cataract.\r\n\r\nThe river is very narrow, the right wall vertical for 200 or 300 feet,\r\nthe left towering to a great height, with a vast pile of broken rocks\r\nlying between the foot of the cliff and the water. Some of the rocks\r\nbroken down from the ledge above have tumbled into the channel and\r\ncaused this fall. One great cubical block, thirty or forty feet high,\r\nstands in the middle of the stream, and the waters, parting to either\r\nside, plunge down about twelve feet, and are broken again by the smaller\r\nrocks into a rapid below. Immediately below the falls the water occupies\r\nthe entire channel, there being no talus at the foot of the cliffs.\r\npowell-canyons-98.jpg\r\n\r\nTUSAYAN HEALING-STONES.\r\n\r\n144 powell-canyons-99.jpg\r\n\r\nK1VA AND STONE CORRALS OF MASHONGNAVI.\r\n\r\nFROM FLAMING GORGE TO THE GATE OF LODORE. 145\r\n\r\nWe embark and run down a short distance, where we find a landing-place\r\nfor dinner.\r\n\r\nOn the waves again all the afternoon. Near the lower end of this canyon,\r\nto which we have given the name of Red Canyon, is a little park, where\r\nstreams come down from distant mountain summits and enter the river on\r\neither side; and here we camp for the night under two stately pines.\r\n\r\nJune 3.--This morning we spread our rations, clothes, etc., on the\r\nground to dry, and several of the party go out for a hunt. I take a walk\r\nof five or six miles up to a pine-grove park, its grassy carpet bedecked\r\nwith crimson velvet flowers, set in groups on the stems of pear-shaped\r\ncactus plants; patches of painted cups are seen here and there, with\r\nyellow blossoms protruding through scarlet bracts; little blue-eyed\r\nflowers are peeping through the grass; and the air is filled with\r\nfragrance from the white blossoms of the Spiraea. A mountain brook runs\r\nthrough the midst, ponded below by beaver dams. It is a quiet place for\r\nretirement from the raging waters of the canyon.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the course of the river from Flaming Gorge\r\nto Beehive Point is in a southerly direction and at right angles to the\r\nUinta Mountains, and cuts into the range until it reaches a point within\r\nfive miles of the crest, where it turns to the east and pursues a course\r\nnot quite parallel to the trend of the range, but crosses the axis\r\nslowly in a direction a little south of east. Thus there is a triangular\r\ntract between the river and the axis of the mountain, with its acute\r\nangle extending eastward. I climb the mountain overlooking this country.\r\nTo the east the peaks are not very high, and already most of the snow\r\nhas melted, but little patches lie here and there under the lee of\r\nledges of rock. To the west the peaks grow higher and the snow fields\r\nlarger. Between the brink of the canyon and the foot of these peaks,\r\nthere is a high bench. A number of creeks have their sources in the\r\nsnowbanks to the south and run north into the canyon, tumbling down\r\nfrom 3,000 to 5,000 feet in a distance of five or six miles. Along their\r\nupper courses they run through grassy valleys, but as they approach Red\r\nCanyon they rapidly disappear under the general surface of the country,\r\nand emerge into the canyon below in\r\n\r\n146\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\ndeep, dark gorges of their own. Each of these short lateral canyons is\r\nmarked by a succession of cascades and a wild confusion of rocks and\r\ntrees and fallen timber and thick undergrowth.\r\n\r\nThe little valleys above are beautiful parks; between the parks are\r\nstately pine forests, half hiding ledges of red sandstone. Mule deer\r\nand elk abound; grizzly bears, too, are abundant; and here wild cats,\r\nwolverines, and mountain lions are at home. The forest aisles are filled\r\nwith the music of birds, and the parks are decked powell-canyons-100.jpg\r\n\r\n\"HOGBACKS,\" WITH INTERVENING VALLEYS.\r\n\r\nwith flowers. Noisy brooks meander through them; ledges of moss-covered\r\nrocks are seen; and gleaming in the distance are the snow fields, and\r\nthe mountain tops are away in the clouds.\r\n\r\nJune 4---We start early and run through to Brown's Park. Halfway down\r\nthe valley, a spur of a red mountain stretches across the river, which\r\ncuts a canyon through it. Here the walls are comparatively low, but\r\nvertical. A vast number of swallows have built their adobe houses on the\r\nface of the cliffs, on either side of the river. The waters are deep and\r\nquiet, but the swallows are swift and noisy enough, sweeping by in their\r\ncurved paths through the air or chattering from the rocks, while the\r\nyoung ones stretch their little heads on naked necks\r\n\r\nFROM FLAMING GORGE TO THE GATE OF LODORE. 147\r\n\r\nthrough the doorways of their mud houses and clamor for food. They are a\r\nnoisy people. We call this Swallow Canyon.\r\n\r\nStill down the river we glide until an early hour in the afternoon, when\r\nwe go into camp under a giant cottonwood standing on the right bank a\r\nlittle way back from the stream. The party has succeeded in killing\r\na fine lot of wild ducks, and during the afternoon a mess of fish is\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nJune 5.--With one of the men I climb a mountain, off on the right. A\r\nlong spur, with broken ledges of rock, puts down to the river, and along\r\nits course, or up the \"hogback,\" as it is called, I make the ascent.\r\nDunn, who is climbing to the same point, is coming up the gulch. Two\r\nhours' hard work has brought us to the summit. These mountains are\r\nall verdure-clad; pine and cedar forests are set on green terraces;\r\nsnow-clad mountains are seen in the distance, to the west; the plains of\r\nthe upper Green stretch out before us to the north until they are lost\r\nin the blue heavens; but half of the river-cleft range intervenes, and\r\nthe river itself is at our feet.\r\n\r\nThis half range, beyond the river, is composed of long ridges nearly\r\nparallel with the valley. On the farther ridge, to the north, four\r\ncreeks have their sources. These cut through the intervening ridges, one\r\nof which is much higher than that on which they head, by canyon gorges;\r\nthen they run with gentle curves across the valley, their banks set with\r\nwillows, box-elders, and cottonwood groves. To the east we look up the\r\nvalley of the Vermilion, through which Fremont found his path on his way\r\nto the great parks of Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe reading of the barometer taken, we start down in company, and reach\r\ncamp tired and hungry, which does not abate one bit our enthusiasm as we\r\ntell of the day's work with its glory of landscape.\r\n\r\nJune 6.--At daybreak I am awakened by a chorus of birds. It seems as\r\nif all the feathered songsters of the region have come to the old tree.\r\nSeveral species of warblers, woodpeckers, and flickers above, meadow\r\nlarks in the grass, and wild geese in the river. I recline on my elbow\r\nand watch a lark near by, and then awaken my bedfellow, to listen to my\r\nJenny Lind. A real morning concert for me; none of your \"matinées\"!\r\n\r\nOur cook has been an ox-driver, or \"bull-whacker,\" on the plains, in\r\n\r\n148\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO. powell-canyons-101.jpg\r\n\r\nAN ANCIENT PUEBLO METATE.\r\n\r\none of those long trains now no longer seen, and he hasn't forgotten his\r\nold ways. In the midst of the concert, his voice breaks in: \"Roll out!\r\nroll out! bulls in the corral! chain up the gaps! Roll out! roll out!\r\nroll out!\" And this is our breakfast bell.\r\n\r\nTo-day we pass through, the park, and camp at the head of another\r\ncanyon.\r\n\r\nJune 7.--To-day two or three of us climb to the summit of the cliff on\r\nthe left, and find its altitude above camp to be 2,086 feet. The rocks\r\nare split with fissures, deep and narrow, sometimes a hundred feet or\r\nmore to the bottom, and these fissures are filled with loose earth and\r\ndecayed vegetation in which lofty pines find root. On a rock we find a\r\npool of clear, cold water, caught from yesterday evening's shower. After\r\na good drink we walk out to the brink of the canyon and look down to\r\nthe water below. I can do this now, but it has taken several years of\r\nmountain climbing to cool my nerves so that I can sit with my feet over\r\nthe edge and calmly look down a precipice 2,000 feet. And yet I cannot\r\nlook on and see another do the same. I must either bid him come away\r\nor turn my head. The canyon walls are buttressed on a grand scale, with\r\ndeep alcoves intervening; columned crags crown the cliffs, and the river\r\nis rolling below.\r\n\r\nWhen we return to camp at noon the sun shines in splendor on vermilion\r\nwalls, shaded into green and gray where the rocks are lichened over; the\r\nriver fills the channel from wall to wall, and the canyon opens, like\r\na beautiful portal, to a region of glory. This evening, as I write,\r\nthe sun is going down and the shadows are settling in the canyon. The\r\nvermilion gleams and roseate hues, blending with the green and gray\r\ntints, are slowly changing to somber brown above, and black shadows are\r\ncreeping over them below; and now it is a dark portal to a region\r\nof gloom--the gateway through which we are to enter on our voyage of\r\nexploration tomorrow. What shall we find? powell-canyons-102.jpg\r\n\r\nA ZUÑÍ STOOL.\r\n\r\nFROM FLAMING GORGE TO THE GATE OF LODORE.\r\n\r\n149\r\n\r\nThe distance from Flaming Gorge to Beehive Point is 9 2/3 miles.\r\nBesides passing through the gorge, the river runs through Horseshoe and\r\nKingfisher canyons, separated by short valleys. The highest point on the\r\nwalls at Flaming Gorge is 1,300 feet above the river. The east wall at\r\nthe apex of Horseshoe Canyon is about 1,600 feet above the water's edge,\r\nand from this point the walls slope both to the head and foot of the\r\ncanyon.\r\n\r\nKingfisher Canyon, starting at the water's edge above, steadily\r\nincreases in altitude to 1,200 feet at the foot.\r\n\r\nRed Canyon is 25 2/3 miles long, and the highest walls are about 2,500\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nBrown's Park is a valley, bounded on either side by a mountain range,\r\nreally an expansion of the canyon. The river, through the park, is 35\r\n1/2 miles long, but passes through two short canyons on its way, where\r\nspurs from the mountains on the south are thrust across its course.\r\npowell-canyons-103.jpg\r\n\r\n150 powell-canyons-104.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE HOME OF THE CHIEF.\r\n\r\n151\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE CANYON OF LODORE.\r\n\r\nJUNE 8.--We enter the canyon, and until noon find a succession of\r\nrapids, over which, our boats have to be taken. Here I must explain our\r\nmethod of proceeding at such places. The \"Emma Dean \"'goes in advance;\r\nthe other boats follow, in obedience to signals. When we approach a\r\nrapid, or what on other rivers would often be called a fall, I stand\r\non deck to examine it, while the oarsmen back water, and we drift on as\r\nslowly as possible. If I can see a clear chute between the rocks, away\r\nwe go; but if the channel is beset entirely across, we signal the other\r\nboats, pull to land, and I walk along the shore for closer examination.\r\nIf this reveals no clear channel, hard work begins. We drop the boats to\r\nthe very head of the dangerous place and let them over by lines or make\r\na portage, frequently carrying both boats and cargoes over the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe waves caused by such falls in a river differ much from the waves\r\nof the sea. The water of an ocean wave merely rises and falls; the form\r\nonly passes on, and form chases form unceasingly. A body floating on\r\nsuch waves merely rises and sinks--does not progress unless impelled by\r\nwind or some other power. But here the water of the wave passes on while\r\nthe form remains. The waters plunge down ten or twenty feet to the foot\r\nof a fall, spring up again in a great wave, then down and up in a series\r\nof billows that gradually disappear in the more quiet waters below; but\r\nthese waves are always there, and one can stand above and count them.\r\n\r\nA boat riding such billows leaps and plunges along with great velocity.\r\nNow, the difficulty in riding over these falls, when no rocks are in the\r\nway, is with the first wave at the foot. This will sometimes gather for\r\na moment, heap up higher and higher, and then break back.\r\n\r\n152 2 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nIf the boat strikes it the instant after it breaks, she cuts through,\r\nand the mad breaker dashes its spray over the boat and washes overboard\r\nall who do not cling tightly. If the boat, in going over the falls,\r\nchances to get caught in some side current and is turned from its\r\ncourse, so as to strike the wave \"broadside on,\" and the wave breaks at\r\nthe same instant, the boat is capsized; then we must cling to her, for\r\nthe water-tight compartments act as buoys and she cannot sink; and so we\r\ngo, dragged through the waves, until still waters are reached, when\r\nwe right the boat and climb aboard. We have several such experiences\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nAt night we camp on the right bank, on a little shelving rock between\r\nthe river and the foot of the cliff; and with night comes gloom into\r\nthese great depths. After supper we sit by our camp fire, made of\r\ndriftwood caught by the rocks, and tell stories of wild life; for\r\nthe men have seen such in the mountains or on the plains, and on the\r\nbattlefields of the South. It is late before we spread our blankets on\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\nLying down, we look up through the canyon and see that only a little of\r\nthe blue heaven appears overhead--a crescent of blue sky, with two or\r\nthree constellations peering down upon us. I do not sleep for some time,\r\nas the excitement of the day has not worn off. Soon I see a bright star\r\nthat appears to rest on the very verge of the cliff overhead to the\r\neast. Slowly it seems to float from its resting place on the rock over\r\nthe canyon. At first it appears like a jewel set on the brink of the\r\ncliff, but as it moves out from the rock I almost wonder that it does\r\nnot fall. In fact, it does seem to descend in a gentle curve, as though\r\nthe bright sky in which the stars are set were spread across the canyon,\r\nresting on either wall, and swayed down by its own weight. The stars\r\nappear to be in the canyon. I soon discover that it is the bright star\r\nVega; so it occurs to me to designate this part of the wall as the\r\n\"Cliff of the Harp.\"\r\n\r\nJune 9.--One of the party suggests that we call this the Canyon of\r\nLodore, and the name is adopted. Very slowly we make our way, often\r\nclimbing on the rocks at the edge of the water for a few hundred yards\r\nto examine the channel before running it. During the afternoon we come\r\nto a place where it is necessary to make a portage. The little boat is\r\nlanded and the others are signaled to come up.\r\n\r\nTHE CANYON OF LODOKE.\r\n\r\n153\r\n\r\nWhen these rapids or broken falls occur usually the channel is\r\nsuddenly narrowed by rocks which have been tumbled from the cliffs or\r\npowell-canyons-105.jpg\r\n\r\nGATE OF LODORE.\r\n\r\nhave been washed in by lateral streams. Immediately above the narrow,\r\nrocky channel, on one or both sides, there is often a bay of quiet\r\nwater, in which a landing can be made with ease. Sometimes\r\n\r\n154 4 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthe water descends with a smooth, unruffled surface from the\r\nbroad, quiet spread above into the narrow, angry channel below by a\r\nsemicircular sag. Great care must be taken not to pass over the brink\r\ninto this deceptive pit, but above it we can row with safety. I walk\r\nalong the bank to examine the ground, leaving one of my men with a flag\r\nto guide the other boats to the landing-place. I soon see one of the\r\nboats make shore all right, and feel no more concern; but a minute\r\nafter, I hear a shout, and, looking around, see one of the boats\r\nshooting down the center of the sag. It is the \"No Name,\" with Captain\r\nHowland, his brother, and Goodman. I feel that its going over is\r\ninevitable, and run to save the third boat. A minute more, and she turns\r\nthe point and heads for the shore. Then I turn down stream again and\r\nscramble along to look for the boat that has gone over. The first fall\r\nis not great, only 10 or 12 feet, and we often run such; but below, the\r\nriver tumbles down again for 40 or 50 feet, in a channel filled with\r\ndangerous rocks that break the waves into whirlpools and beat them into\r\nfoam. I pass around a great crag just in time to see the boat strike\r\na rock and, rebounding from the shock, careen and fill its open\r\ncompartment with water. Two of the men lose their oars; she swings\r\naround and is carried down at a rapid rate, broadside on, for a few\r\nyards, when, striking amidships on another rock with great force, she\r\nis broken quite in two and the men are thrown into the river. But the\r\nlarger part of the boat floats buoyantly, and they soon seize it, and\r\ndown the river they drift, past the rocks for a few hundred yards, to a\r\nsecond rapid filled with huge boulders, where the boat strikes again and\r\nis dashed to pieces, and the men and fragments are soon carried beyond\r\nmy sight. Running along, I turn a bend and see a man's head above the\r\nwater, washed about in a whirlpool below a great rock. It is Frank\r\nGoodman, clinging to the rock with a grip upon which life depends.\r\nComing opposite, I see Howland trying to go to his aid from an island on\r\nwhich he has been washed. Soon he comes near enough to reach Frank with\r\na pole, which he extends toward him. The latter lets go the rock, grasps\r\nthe pole, and is pulled ashore. Seneca Howland is washed farther down\r\nthe island and is caught by some rocks, and, though somewhat bruised,\r\nmanages to get ashore in safety. This seems a long time as I tell it,\r\nbut it is quickly done.\r\n\r\nTHE CANYON OF LODORE. 155\r\n\r\nAnd now the three men are on an island, with a swift, dangerous river on\r\neither side and a fall below. The \"Emma Dean\" is soon brought down, and\r\nSumner, starting above as far as possible, pushes powell-canyons-106.jpg\r\n\r\nWRECK AT DISASTER FALLS.\r\n\r\nout. Right skillfully he plies the oars, and a few strokes set him on\r\nthe island at the proper point. Then they all pull the boat up stream as\r\nfar as they are able, until they stand in water up to their necks. One\r\n\r\n156 6 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nsits on a rock and holds the boat until the others are ready to pull,\r\nthen gives the boat a push, clings to it with his hands, and climbs in\r\nas they pull for mainland, which they reach in safety. We are as glad\r\nto shake hands with them as though they had been on a voyage around the\r\nworld and wrecked on a distant coast.\r\n\r\nDown the river half a mile we find that the after cabin of the\r\npowell-canyons-107.jpg\r\n\r\nMETALLIFEROUS VEINS EXPOSED TO VIEW.\r\n\r\nwrecked boat, with a part of the bottom, ragged and splintered, has\r\nfloated against a rock and stranded. There are valuable articles in the\r\ncabin; but, on examination, we determine that life should not\r\n\r\nTHE CANYON OF LODORE. 157\r\n\r\nbe risked to save them. Of course, the cargo of rations, instruments,\r\nand clothing is gone.\r\n\r\nWe return to the boats and make camp for the night. No sleep comes to\r\nme in all those dark hours. The rations, instruments, and clothing have\r\nbeen divided among the boats, anticipating such an accident as this; and\r\nwe started with duplicates of everything that was deemed necessary\r\nto success. But, in the distribution, there was one exception to this\r\nprecaution--the barometers were all placed in one boat, and they are\r\nlost! There is a possibility that they are in the cabin lodged against\r\nthe rock, for that is where they were kept. But, then, how to reach\r\nthem? The river is rising. Will they be there to-morrow? Can I go out to\r\nSalt Lake City and obtain barometers from New York?\r\n\r\nJune 10.--I have determined to get the barometers from the wreck, if\r\nthey are there. After breakfast, while the men make the portage, I go\r\ndown again for another examination, There the cabin lies, only carried\r\n50 or 60 feet farther on. Carefully looking over the ground, I am\r\nsatisfied that it can be reached with safety, and return to tell the\r\nmen my conclusion. Sumner and Dunn volunteer to take the little boat and\r\nmake the attempt. They start, reach it, and out come the barometers!\r\nThe boys set up a shout, and I join them, pleased that they should be as\r\nglad as myself to save the instruments. When the boat lands on our side,\r\nI find that the only things saved from the wreck were the barometers, a\r\npackage of thermometers, and a three-gallon keg of whiskey. The last is\r\nwhat the men were shouting about. They had taken it aboard unknown to\r\nme, and now I am glad they did take it, for it will do them good, as\r\nthey are drenched every day by the melting snow which runs down from the\r\nsummits of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nWe come back to our work at the portage and find that it is necessary to\r\ncarry our rations over the rocks for nearly a mile and to let our\r\nboats down with lines, except at a few points, where they also must be\r\ncarried. Between the river and the eastern wall of the canyon there\r\nis an immense talus of broken rocks. These have tumbled down from the\r\ncliffs above and constitute a vast pile of huge angular fragments. On\r\nthese we build a path for a quarter of a mile to a small sand-beach\r\ncovered with driftwood, through which we clear a way for several\r\n\r\n158 8 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nhundred yards, then continue the trail over another pile of rocks nearly\r\nhalf a mile farther down, to a little bay. The greater part of the day\r\nis spent in this work. Then we carry our cargoes down to the beach and\r\ncamp for the night.\r\n\r\nWhile the men are building the camp fire, we discover an iron bake-oven,\r\nseveral tin plates, a part of a boat, and many other fragments, which\r\ndenote that this is the place where Ashley's party was wrecked.\r\n\r\nJune 11.--This day is spent in carrying our rations down to the bay--no\r\nsmall task, climbing over the rocks with sacks of flour and bacon. We\r\ncarry them by stages of about 500 yards each, and when night comes and\r\nthe last sack is on the beach, we are tired, bruised, and glad to sleep.\r\n\r\nJune 12.--To-day we take the boats down to the bay. While at this work\r\nwe discover three sacks of flour from the wrecked boat that have lodged\r\nin the rocks. We carry them above high-water mark and leave them, as\r\nour cargoes are already too heavy for the three remaining boats. We also\r\nfind two or three oars, which we place with them.\r\n\r\nAs Ashley and his party were wrecked here and as we have lost one of our\r\nboats at the same place, we adopt the name Disaster Falls for the scene\r\nof so much peril and loss.\r\n\r\nThough some of his companions were drowned, Ashley and one other\r\nsurvived the wreck, climbed the canyon wall, and found their way across\r\nthe Wasatch Mountains to Salt Lake City, living chiefly on berries,\r\nas they wandered through an unknown and difficult country. When they\r\narrived at Salt Lake they were almost destitute of clothing and nearly\r\nstarved. The Mormon people gave them food and clothing and employed them\r\nto work on the foundation of the Temple until they had earned sufficient\r\nto enable them to leave the country. Of their subsequent history, I have\r\nno knowledge. It is possible they returned to the scene of the disaster,\r\nas a little creek entering the river below is known as Ashley's Creek,\r\nand it is reported that he built a cabin and trapped on this river for\r\none or two winters; but this may have been before the disaster.\r\n\r\nJune 13.--Rocks, rapids, and portages still. We camp to-night at\r\n\r\nTHE CANYON OF LODOEE.\r\n\r\n159\r\n\r\nthe foot of the left fall, on a little patch of flood plain covered\r\nwith a dense growth of box-elders, stopping early in order to spread the\r\nclothing and rations to dry. Everything is wet and spoiling.\r\n\r\nJune 14.--Howland and I climb the wall on the west side of the canyon\r\nto an altitude of 2,000 feet. Standing above and looking to the west, we\r\ndiscover a large park, five or six miles wide and twenty or thirty long.\r\nThe cliff we have climbed forms a wall between the canyon and the park,\r\nfor it is 800 feet down the western side to the valley. A creek comes\r\nwinding down 1,200 feet above the river, and, entering the intervening\r\nwall by a canyon, plunges down more than 1,000 feet, by a broken\r\ncascade, into the river below.\r\n\r\nJune 15.--To-day, while we make another portage, a peak, standing on the\r\neast wall, is climbed by two of the men and found to be 2,700 feet above\r\nthe river. On the east side of the canyon a vast amphitheater has\r\nbeen cut, with massive buttresses and deep, dark alcoves in which\r\npowell-canyons-108.jpg\r\n\r\nWINNIE'S GROTTO, A SIDE CANYON.\r\n\r\n160 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\ngrow beautiful mosses and delicate ferns, while springs burst out from\r\nthe farther recesses and wind in silver threads over floors of sand\r\nrock. Here we have three falls in close succession. At the first the\r\nwater is compressed into a very narrow channel against the right-hand\r\ncliff, and falls 15 feet in 10 yards. At the second we have a broad\r\nsheet of water tumbling down 20 feet over a group of rocks that thrust\r\ntheir dark heads through the foam. The third is a broken fall, or short,\r\nabrupt rapid, where the water makes a descent of more than 20 feet among\r\nhuge, fallen fragments of the cliff. We name the group Triplet Falls.\r\nWe make a portage around the first; past the second and the third we let\r\ndown with lines.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, Dunn and Howland having returned from their climb,\r\nwe run down three quarters of a mile on quiet waters and land at the\r\nhead of another fall. On examination, we find that there is an abrupt\r\nplunge of a few feet and then the river tumbles for half a mile with a\r\ndescent of a hundred feet, in a channel beset with great numbers of\r\nhuge boulders. This stretch of the river is named Hell's Half-Mile. The\r\nremaining portion of the day is occupied in making a trail among the\r\nrocks at the foot of the rapid.\r\n\r\nJune 16.--Our first work this morning is to carry our cargoes to the\r\nfoot of the falls. Then we commence letting down the boats. We take two\r\nof them down in safety, but not without great difficulty; for, where\r\nsuch a vast body of water, rolling down an inclined plane, is broken\r\ninto eddies and cross-currents by rocks projecting from the cliffs and\r\npiles of boulders in the channel, it requires excessive labor and\r\nmuch care to prevent the boats from being dashed against the rocks or\r\nbreaking away. Sometimes we are compelled to hold the boat against a\r\nrock above a chute until a second line, attached to the stem, is carried\r\nto some point below, and when all is ready the first line is detached\r\nand the boat given to the current, when she shoots down and the men\r\nbelow swing her into some eddy.\r\n\r\nAt such a place we are letting down the last boat, and as she is set\r\nfree a wave turns her broadside down the stream, with the stem, to which\r\nthe line is attached, from shore and a little up. They haul on the line\r\nto bring the boat in, but the power of the current, striking obliquely\r\nagainst her, shoots her out into the middle of the river. The\r\n\r\nTHE CANYON OF LODORE.\r\n\r\n161\r\n\r\nmen have their hands burned with the friction of the passing line; the\r\nboat breaks away and speeds with great velocity down the stream.\r\nThe \"Maid of the Canyon\" is lost! So it seems; but she drifts\r\npowell-canyons-109.jpg\r\n\r\nERODED TOWERS CAPPED WITH LARGE BLOCKS OF SANDSTONE.\r\n\r\nsome distance and swings into an eddy, in which she spins about until we\r\narrive with the small boat and rescue her.\r\n\r\nSoon we are on our way again, and stop at the mouth of a little brook on\r\nthe right for a late dinner. This brook comes down from the distant\r\n\r\n162\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nmountains in a deep side canyon. We set out to explore it, but are soon\r\ncut off from farther progress up the gorge by a high rock, over which\r\nthe brook glides in a smooth sheet. The rock is not quite vertical, and\r\nthe water does not plunge over it in a fall.\r\n\r\nThen we climb up to the left for an hour, and are 1,000 feet above the\r\nriver and 600 above the brook. Just before us the canyon divides, a\r\nlittle stream coming down on the right and another on the left, and we\r\ncan look away up either of these canyons, through an ascending vista, to\r\ncliffs and crags and towers a mile back and 2,000 feet overhead. To the\r\nright a dozen gleaming cascades are seen. Pines and firs stand on the\r\nrocks and aspens overhang the brooks. The rocks below are red and brown,\r\nset in deep shadows, but above they are buff and vermilion and stand in\r\nthe sunshine. The light above, made more brilliant by the bright-tinted\r\nrocks, and the shadows below, more gloomy powell-canyons-110.jpg\r\n\r\nFIRE IN CAMP.\r\n\r\nby reason of the somber hues of the brown walls, increase the apparent\r\ndepths of the canyons, and it seems a long way up to the world of\r\nsunshine and open sky, and a long way down to the bottom of the\r\n\r\nTHE CANYON OF LODORE. 163\r\n\r\ncanyon glooms. Never before have I received such an impression of the\r\nvast heights of these canyon walls, not even at the Cliff of the Harp,\r\nwhere the very heavens seemed to rest on their summits. We sit on some\r\noverhanging rocks and enjoy the scene for a time, listening to the music\r\nof the falling waters away up the canyon. We name this Rippling Brook.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we make a short run to the mouth of another little\r\ncreek, coming down from the left into an alcove filled with luxuriant\r\nvegetation. Here camp is made, with a group of cedars on one side and a\r\ndense mass of box-elders and dead willows on the other.\r\n\r\nI go up to explore the alcove. While away a whirlwind comes and scatters\r\nthe fire among the dead willows and cedar-spray, and soon there is\r\na conflagration. The men rush for the boats, leaving all they cannot\r\nreadily seize at the moment, and even then they have their clothing\r\nburned and hair singed, and Bradley has his ears scorched. The cook\r\nfills his arms with the mess-kit, and jumping into a boat, stumbles and\r\nfalls, and away go our cooking utensils into the river. Our plates are\r\ngone; our spoons are gone; our knives and forks are gone. \"Water catch\r\n'em; h-e-a-p catch 'em.\"\r\n\r\nWhen on the boats, the men are compelled to cut loose, as the flames,\r\nrunning out on the overhanging willows, are scorching them. Loose on the\r\nstream, they must go down, for the water is too swift to make headway\r\nagainst it. Just below is a rapid, filled with rocks. On the shoot,\r\nno channel explored, no signal to guide them! Just at this juncture\r\nI chance to see them, but have not yet discovered the fire, and the\r\nstrange movements of the men fill me with astonishment. Down the rocks\r\nI clamber, and run to the bank. When I arrive they have landed. Then\r\nwe all go back to the late camp to see if anything left behind can be\r\nsaved. Some of the clothing and bedding taken out of the boats is found,\r\nalso a few tin cups, basins, and a camp kettle; and this is all the\r\nmess-kit we now have. Yet we do just as well as ever.\r\n\r\nJune 17.--We run down to the mouth of Yampa River. This has been a\r\nchapter of disasters and toils, notwithstanding which the Canyon of\r\nLodore was not devoid of scenic interest, even beyond the power\r\n\r\n164 powell-canyons-111.jpg\r\n\r\nAN ISOLATED HOUSE AT ZUÑI.\r\n\r\nTHE CANYON OF LODOKE.\r\n\r\n165\r\n\r\nof pen to tell. The roar of its waters was heard unceasingly from the\r\nhour we entered it until we landed here. No quiet in all that time.\r\nBut its walls and cliffs, its peaks and crags, its amphitheaters and\r\nalcoves, tell a story of beauty and grandeur that I hear yet--and shall\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nThe Canyon of Lodore is 20 3/4 miles in length. It starts abruptly at\r\nwhat we have called the Gate of Lodore, with walls nearly 2,000 feet\r\nhigh, and they are never lower than this until we reach Alcove Brook,\r\nabout three miles above the foot. They are very irregular, standing\r\nin vertical or overhanging cliffs in places, terraced in others, or\r\nreceding in steep slopes, and are broken by many side gulches and\r\ncanyons. The highest point on the wall is at Dunn's Cliff, near Triplet\r\nFalls, where the rocks reach an altitude of 2,700 feet, but the peaks a\r\nlittle way back rise nearly 1,000 feet higher. Yellow pines, nut pines,\r\nfirs, and cedars stand in extensive forests on the Uinta Mountains, and,\r\nclinging to the rocks and growing in the crevices, come down the walls\r\nto the water's edge from Flaming Gorge to Echo Park. The red sandstones\r\nare lichened. over; delicate mosses grow in the moist places, and ferns\r\nfestoon the walls. powell-canyons-112.jpg\r\n\r\n166 powell-canyons-113.jpg\r\n\r\nAN ORAIBE COURT.\r\n\r\n167\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF THE UINTA RIVER.\r\n\r\nTHE Yampa enters the Green from the east. At a point opposite its mouth\r\nthe Green runs to the south, at the foot of a rock about 700 feet high\r\nand a mile long, and then turns sharply around the rock to the right\r\nand runs back in a northerly course parallel to its former direction for\r\nnearly another mile, thus having the opposite sides of a long, narrow\r\nrock for its bank. The tongue of rock so formed is a peninsular\r\nprecipice with a mural escarpment along its whole course on the east,\r\nbut broken down at places on the west.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the river, opposite the rock and below the Yampa,\r\nthere is a little park, just large enough for a farm, already fenced\r\nwith high walls of gray homogeneous sandstone. There are three river\r\nentrances to this park: one down the Yampa; one below, by coming up the\r\nGreen; and another down the Green. There is also a land entrance down\r\na lateral canyon. Elsewhere the park is inaccessible. Through this land\r\nentrance by the side canyon there is a trail made by Indian hunters, who\r\ncome down here in certain seasons to kill mountain sheep. Great hollow\r\ndomes are seen in the eastern side of the rock, against which the Green\r\nsweeps; willows border the river; clumps of box-elder are seen; and a\r\nfew cottonwoods stand at the lower end. Standing opposite the rock, our\r\nwords are repeated with startling clearness, but in a soft, mellow tone,\r\nthat transforms them into magical music. Scarcely can one believe it is\r\nthe echo of his own voice. In some places two or three echoes come back;\r\nin other places they repeat themselves, passing back and forth across\r\nthe river between this rock and the eastern wall. To hear these repeated\r\nechoes well, we must shout. Some of the party aver that ten or twelve\r\nrepetitions can be heard. To\r\n\r\n168 8 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nme, they seem rapidly to diminish and merge by multiplicity, like\r\ntelegraph poles on an outstretched plain. I have observed the same\r\nphenomenon once before in the cliffs near Long's Peak, and am pleased to\r\nmeet with it again.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon Bradley and I climb some cliffs to the north.\r\nMountain sheep are seen above us, and they stand out on the rocks and\r\neye us intently, not seeming to move. Their color is much like that of\r\nthe gray sandstone beneath them, and, immovable as they are, they appear\r\nlike carved forms. Now a fine ram beats the rock with his fore foot,\r\nand, wheeling around, they all bound away together, leaping over rocks\r\nand chasms and climbing walls where no man can follow, and this with an\r\nease and grace most wonderful. At night we return to our camp under the\r\nbox-elders by the river side. Here we are to spend two or three days,\r\nmaking a series of astronomic observations for latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nJune 18.--We have named the long peninsular rock on the other side Echo\r\nRock. Desiring to climb it, Bradley and I take the little boat and\r\npull up stream as far as possible, for it cannot be climbed directly\r\nopposite. We land on a talus of rocks at the upper end in order to reach\r\na place where it seems practicable to make the ascent; but we find we\r\nmust go still farther up the river. So we scramble along, until we reach\r\na place where the river sweeps against the wall. Here we find a shelf\r\nalong which we can pass, and now are ready for the climb.\r\n\r\nWe start up a gulch; then pass to the left on a bench along the wall;\r\nthen up again over broken rocks; then we reach more benches, along\r\nwhich we walk, until we find more broken rocks and crevices, by which we\r\nclimb; still up, until we have ascended 600 or 800 feet, when we are\r\nmet by a sheer precipice. Looking about, we find a place where it seems\r\npossible to climb. I go ahead; Bradley hands the barometer to me, and\r\nfollows. So we proceed, stage by stage, until we are nearly to the\r\nsummit. Here, by making a spring, I gain a foothold in a little crevice,\r\nand grasp an angle of the rock overhead. I find I can get up no farther\r\nand cannot step back, for I dare not let go with my hand and cannot\r\nreach foothold below without. I call to Bradley for help. He finds a way\r\nby which he can get to the top of the\r\n\r\nFROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF UINTA RIVER.\r\n\r\n169\r\n\r\nrock over my head, but cannot reach me. Then he looks around for some\r\nstick or limb of a tree, but finds none. Then he suggests that he would\r\nbetter help me with the barometer case, but I fear I cannot hold on to\r\nit. The moment is critical. Standing on my toes, my muscles begin to\r\ntremble. It is sixty or eighty feet to the foot of the precipice. If I\r\nlose my hold I shall fall to the bottom and then perhaps roll over the\r\nbench and tumble still farther down the cliff. At this instant it occurs\r\nto Bradley to take off his drawers, which he does, and swings them down\r\nto me. I hug close to the rock, let go with my hand, seize the dangling\r\nlegs, and with his assistance am enabled to gain the top.\r\n\r\nThen we walk out on the peninsular rock, make the necessary observations\r\nfor determining its altitude above camp, and return, finding an easy way\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nJune 19.--To-day, Howland, Bradley, and I take the \"Emma Dean\" and start\r\nup the Yampa River. The stream is much swollen, the current swift, and\r\nwe are able to make but slow progress against it. The canyon in this\r\npart of the course of the Yampa is cut through light gray sandstone.\r\nThe river is very winding, and the swifter water is usually\r\npowell-canyons-114.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE.\r\n\r\n170\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nfound on the outside of the curve, sweeping against vertical cliffs\r\noften a thousand feet high. In the center of these curves, in many\r\nplaces, the rock above overhangs the river. On the opposite side the\r\nwalls are broken, craggy, and sloping, and occasionally side canyons\r\nenter. When we have rowed until we are quite tired we stop and take\r\nadvantage of one of these broken places to climb out of the canyon. When\r\nabove, we can look up the Yampa for a distance of several miles. From\r\nthe summit of the immediate walls of the canyon the rocks rise gently\r\nback for a distance of a mile or two, having the appearance of a\r\nvalley with an irregular and rounded sandstone floor and in the\r\npowell-canyons-115.jpg\r\n\r\nECHO PARK.\r\n\r\ncenter a deep gorge, which is the canyon. The rim of this valley on the\r\nnorth is from 2,500 to 3,000 feet above the river; on the south it is\r\nnot so high. A number of peaks stand on this northern rim, the highest\r\nof which has received the name Mount Dawes.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we descend to our boat and return to camp in Echo\r\nPark, gliding down in twenty minutes on the rapid river, a distance of\r\nfour or five miles, which was made up stream only by several hours' hard\r\nrowing in the morning.\r\n\r\nJune 20.--This morning two of the men take me up the Yampa for a short\r\ndistance, and I go out to climb. Having reached the top of\r\n\r\nFROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF UINTA RIVER.\r\n\r\n171\r\n\r\nthe canyon, I walk over long stretches of naked sandstone, crossing\r\ngulches now and then, and by noon reach the summit of Mount Dawes. From\r\nthis point I can look away to the north and see in the dim distance the\r\nSweetwater and Wind River mountains, more than 100 miles away. To the\r\nnorthwest the Wasatch Mountains are in view, and peaks of the Uinta.\r\nTo the east I can see the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains,\r\npowell-canyons-116.jpg\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF WALL, ZUÑI.\r\n\r\nmore than 150 miles distant. The air is singularly clear to-day;\r\nmountains and buttes stand in sharp outline, valleys stretch out in\r\nperspective, and I can look down into the deep canyon gorges and see\r\ngleaming waters.\r\n\r\nDescending, I cross to a ridge near the brink of the Canyon of Lodore,\r\nthe highest point of which is nearly as high as the last mentioned\r\nmountain. Late in the afternoon I stand on this elevated\r\n\r\n172\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\npoint and discover a monument that has evidently been built by human\r\nhands. A few plants are growing in the joints between the rocks, and\r\nall are lichened over to a greater or less extent, giving evidence\r\npowell-canyons-117.jpg\r\n\r\n172\r\n\r\nKIVAS OF SHUMOPAVI.\r\n\r\nthat the pile was built a long time ago. This line of peaks, the eastern\r\nextension of the Uinta Mountains, has received the name of Sierra\r\nEscalante, in honor of a Spanish priest who traveled in this region of\r\ncountry nearly a century ago. Perchance the reverend father built this\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nNow I return to the river and discharge my gun, as a signal for the boat\r\nto come and take me down to camp. While we have been in the park the\r\nmen have succeeded in catching a number of fish, and we have an abundant\r\nsupply. This is a delightful addition to our menu.\r\n\r\nJune 21.-- We float around the long rock and enter another canyon. The\r\nwalls are high and vertical, the canyon is narrow, and the river\r\n\r\nFROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF UINTA RIVER.\r\n\r\n173\r\n\r\nfills the whole space below, so that there is no landing-place at the\r\nfoot of the cliff. The Green is greatly increased by the Yampa, and we\r\nnow have a much larger river. All this volume of water, confined, as it\r\nis, in a narrow channel and rushing with great velocity, is set eddying\r\nand spinning in whirlpools by projecting rocks and short curves, and the\r\nwaters waltz their way through the canyon, making their own rippling,\r\nrushing, roaring music. The canyon is much narrower than any we have\r\nseen. We manage our boats with difficulty. They spin about from side to\r\nside and we know not where we are going, and find it impossible to keep\r\nthem headed down the stream. At first this causes us great alarm, but we\r\nsoon find there is little danger, and that there is a general movement\r\nor progression down the river, to which this whirling is but an\r\nadjunct--that it is the merry mood powell-canyons-118.jpg\r\n\r\nGENERAL VTEW OF AWATUBI.\r\n\r\nof the river to dance through this deep, dark gorge, and right gaily do\r\nwe join in the sport.\r\n\r\nBut soon our revel is interrupted by a cataract; its roaring command is\r\nheeded by all our power at the oars, and we pull against the whirling\r\ncurrent. The \"Emma Dean\" is brought up against a cliff\r\n\r\n174 4 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nabout 50 feet above the brink of the fall. By vigorously plying the oars\r\non the side opposite the wall, as if to pull up stream, we can hold her\r\nagainst the rock. The boats behind are signaled to land where they can.\r\nThe \"Maid of the Canyon\" is pulled to the left wall, and, by constant\r\nrowing, they can hold her also. The \"Sister\" is run into an alcove on\r\nthe right, where an eddy is in a dance, and in this she joins. Now my\r\nlittle boat is held against the wall only by the utmost exertion, and\r\nit is impossible to make headway against the current. On examination, I\r\nfind a horizontal crevice in the rock, about 10 feet above the water and\r\na boat's length below us; so we let her down to that point. One of the\r\nmen clambers into the crevice, into which he can just crawl; we toss him\r\nthe line, which he makes fast in the rocks, and now our boat is tied up.\r\nThen I follow into the crevice and we crawl along up stream a distance\r\nof 50 feet or more, and find a broken place where we can climb about 50\r\nfeet higher. Here we stand on a shelf that passes along down stream to\r\na point above the falls, where it is broken down, and a pile of rocks,\r\nover which we can descend to the river, is lying against the foot of the\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that one of the boats is on the other side. I\r\nsignal for the men to pull her up alongside of the wall, but it cannot\r\nbe done; then to cross. This they do, gaining the wall on our side just\r\nabove where the \"Emma Dean\" is tied.\r\n\r\nThe third boat is out of sight, whirling in the eddy of a recess.\r\nLooking about, I find another horizontal crevice, along which I crawl to\r\na point just over the water where this boat is lying, and, calling loud\r\nand long, I finally succeed in making the crew understand that I want\r\nthem to bring the boat down, hugging the wall. This they accomplish by\r\ntaking advantage of every crevice and knob on the face of the cliff, so\r\nthat we have the three boats together at a point a few yards above the\r\nfalls. Now, by passing a line up on the shelf, the boats can be let down\r\nto the broken rocks below. This we do, and, making a short portage, our\r\ntroubles here are over.\r\n\r\nBelow the falls the canyon is wider, and there is more or less space\r\nbetween the river and the walls; but the stream, though wide, is rapid,\r\nand rolls at a fearful rate among the rocks. We proceed with great\r\ncaution, and run the large boats wholly by signal.\r\n\r\nFROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF UINTA EIVER.\r\n\r\n175\r\n\r\nAt night we camp at the mouth of a small creek, which affords us a\r\ngood supper of trout. In camp to-night we discuss the propriety\r\npowell-canyons-119.jpg\r\n\r\nSWALLOW CAVE.\r\n\r\nof several different names for this canyon. At the falls encountered at\r\nnoon its characteristics change suddenly. Above, it is very narrow, and\r\nthe walls are almost vertical; below, the canyon is much wider\r\n\r\n176 6 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nand more flaring, and high up on the sides crags, pinnacles, and towers\r\nare seen. A number of wild and narrow side canyons enter, and the walls\r\nare much broken. After many suggestions our choice rests between two\r\nnames, Whirlpool Canyon and Craggy Canyon, neither of which is strictly\r\nappropriate for both parts of it; so we leave the discussion at this\r\npoint, with the understanding that it is best, before finally deciding\r\non a name, to wait until we see what the character of the canyon is\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nJune 22.--Still making short portages and letting down with lines. While\r\nwe are waiting for dinner to-day, I climb a point that gives me a good\r\nview of the river for two or three miles below, and I think we can make\r\na long run. After dinner we start; the large boats are to follow in\r\nfifteen minutes and look out for the signal to land. Into the middle\r\nof the stream we row, and down the rapid river we glide, only making\r\nstrokes enough with the oars to guide the boat. What a headlong ride it\r\nis! shooting past rocks and islands. I am soon filled with exhilaration\r\nonly experienced before in riding a fleet horse over the outstretched\r\nprairie. One, two, three, four miles we go, rearing and plunging with\r\nthe waves, until we wheel to the right into a beautiful park and land on\r\nan island, where we go into camp.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two before sunset I cross to the mainland and climb a point\r\nof rocks where I can overlook the park and its surroundings. On the\r\neast it is bounded by a high mountain ridge. A semicircle of naked hills\r\nbounds it on the north, west, and south.\r\n\r\nThe broad, deep river meanders through the park, interrupted by many\r\nwooded islands; so I name it Island Park, and decide to call the canyon\r\nabove, Whirlpool Canyon.\r\n\r\nJune 23.--We remain in camp to-day to repair our boats, which have had\r\nhard knocks and are leaking. Two of the men go out with the barometer to\r\nclimb the cliff at the foot of Whirlpool Canyon and measure the walls;\r\nanother goes on the mountain to hunt; and Bradley and I spend the day\r\namong the rocks, studying an interesting geologic fold and collecting\r\nfossils. Late in the afternoon the hunter returns and brings with him a\r\nfine, fat deer; so we give his name to the mountain--Mount Hawkins. Just\r\nbefore night we move camp to the lower end of the park, floating down\r\nthe river about four miles.\r\n\r\nPROM ECHO PAEK TO THE MOUTH OF UINTA KIVEK.\r\n\r\n177\r\n\r\nJune 24.--Bradley and I start early to climb the mountain ridge to the\r\neast, and find its summit to be nearly 3,000 feet above camp. It has\r\nrequired some labor to scale it; but on its top, what a view! There is a\r\nlong spur running out from the Uinta Mountains toward the south, and\r\nthe river runs lengthwise through it. Coming down Lodore\r\npowell-canyons-120.jpg\r\n\r\nVIEW OF SIIUMOPAVI.\r\n\r\nand Whirlpool canyons, we cut through the southern slope of the Uinta\r\nMountains; and the lower end of this latter canyon runs into the spur,\r\nbut, instead of splitting it the whole length, the river wheels to the\r\nright at the foot of Whirlpool Canyon in a great curve to the northwest\r\nthrough Island Park. At the lower end of the park, the river\r\n\r\n178\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO. powell-canyons-121.jpg\r\n\r\nRUINS.\r\n\r\nturns again to the southeast and cuts into the mountain to its center\r\nand then makes a detour to the southwest, splitting the mountain ridge\r\nfor a distance of six miles nearly to its foot, and then turns out of it\r\nto the left. All this we can see where we stand on the summit of Mount\r\nHawkins, and so we name the gorge below, Split Mountain Canyon.\r\n\r\nWe are standing 3,000 feet above the waters, which are troubled with\r\nbillows and are white with foam. The walls are set with crags and peaks\r\nand buttressed towers and overhanging domes. Turning to the right, the\r\npark is below us, its island groves reflected by the deep, quiet waters.\r\nRich meadows stretch out on either hand to the verge of a sloping plain\r\nthat comes down from the distant mountains. These plains are of almost\r\nnaked rock, in strange contrast to the meadows,--blue and lilac colored\r\nrocks, buff and pink, vermilion and brown,\r\n\r\nFROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF UINTA RIVER.\r\n\r\n179\r\n\r\nand all these colors clear and bright. A dozen little creeks, dry the\r\ngreater part of the year, run down through the half circle of exposed\r\nformations, radiating from the island center to the rim of the basin.\r\nEach creek has its system of side streams and each side stream has\r\nits system of laterals, and again these are divided; so that\r\nthis outstretched slope of rock is elaborately embossed. Beds of\r\ndifferent-colored formations run in parallel bands on either side.\r\nThe perspective, modified by the undulations, gives the bands a waved\r\nappearance, and the high colors gleam in the midday sun with the luster\r\nof satin. We are tempted to call this Rainbow Park. Away beyond these\r\nbeds are the Uinta and Wasatch mountains with their pine forests and\r\nsnow fields and naked peaks. Now we turn to the right and look up\r\nWhirlpool Canyon, a deep gorge with a river at the bottom--a gloomy\r\nchasm, where mad waves roar; but at this distance and altitude the river\r\nis but a rippling brook, and the chasm a narrow cleft. The top of\r\nthe mountain on which we stand is a broad, grassy table, and a herd\r\npowell-canyons-122.jpg\r\n\r\nRUINS.\r\n\r\n180 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nof deer are feeding in the distance. Walking over to the southeast,\r\nwe look down into the valley of White River, and beyond that see the\r\nfar-distant Rocky Mountains, in mellow, perspective haze, through which\r\nsnow fields shine.\r\n\r\nJune 25.--This morning we enter Split Mountain Canyon, sailing in\r\n\r\nthrough a broad, flaring, brilliant gateway. We run two or three rapids,\r\nafter they have been carefully examined. Then we have a series of six\r\nor eight, over which we are compelled to pass by letting the boats down\r\nwith lines. This occupies the entire day, and we camp at night at the\r\nmouth of a great cave. The cave is at the foot of one of these rapids,\r\nand the waves dash in nearly to its end. We can pass along a little\r\nshelf at the side until we reach the back part. Swallows have built\r\ntheir nests in the ceiling, and they wheel in, chattering and scolding\r\nat our intrusion; but their clamor is almost drowned by the noise of the\r\nwaters. Looking out of the cave, we can see, far up the river, a line\r\nof crags standing sentinel on either side, and Mount Hawkins in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nJune 26.--The forenoon is spent in getting our large boats over the\r\nrapids. This afternoon we find three falls in close succession. We\r\ncarry our rations over the rocks and let our boats shoot over the falls,\r\nchecking and bringing them to land with lines in the eddies below. At\r\nthree o'clock we are all aboard again. Down the river we are carried\r\nby the swift waters at great speed, sheering around a rock now and then\r\nwith a timely stroke or two of the oars. At one point the river turns\r\nfrom left to right, in a direction at right angles to the canyon, in\r\na long chute and strikes the right, where its waters are heaped up in\r\ngreat billows that tumble back in breakers. We glide into the chute\r\nbefore we see the danger, and it is too late to stop. Two or three hard\r\nstrokes are given on the right and we pause for an instant, expecting\r\nto be dashed against the rock. But the bow of the boat leaps high on a\r\ngreat wave, the rebounding waters hurl us back, and the peril is past.\r\nThe next moment the other boats are hurriedly signaled to land on the\r\nleft. Accomplishing this, the men walk along the shore, holding the\r\nboats near the bank, and let them drift around. Starting again, we soon\r\ndebouch into a beautiful valley, glide down its length for 10 miles, and\r\ncamp under a grand\r\n\r\nFROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF UINTA RIVER.\r\n\r\n181\r\n\r\nold cottonwood. This is evidently a frequent resort for Indians. Tent\r\npoles are lying about, and the dead embers of late camp fires are seen.\r\nOn the plains to the left, antelope are feeding. Now and then a wolf is\r\nseen, and after dark they make the air resound with their howling.\r\nJune 27.--Now our way is along a gently flowing river, beset with\r\npowell-canyons-123.jpg\r\n\r\nINDIAN LODGE IN THE UINTA VALLEY.\r\n\r\nmany islands; groves are seen on either side, and natural meadows,\r\nwhere herds of antelope are feeding. Here and there we have views of\r\nthe distant mountains on the right. During the afternoon we make a long\r\ndetour to the west and return again to a point not more than half a mile\r\nfrom where we started at noon, and here we camp for the night under a\r\nhigh bluff. June 28.--To-day the scenery on either side of the river is\r\nmuch\r\n\r\n182 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthe same as that of yesterday, except that two or three lakes are\r\ndiscovered, lying in the valley to the west. After dinner we run but a\r\nfew minutes when we discover the mouth of the Uinta, a river coming\r\nin from the west. Up the valley of this stream about 40 miles the\r\nreservation of the Uinta Indians is situated. We propose to go there\r\nand see if we can replenish our mess-kit, and perhaps send letters to\r\nfriends. We also desire to establish an astronomic station here; and\r\nhence this will be our stopping place for several days.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Captain Berthoud surveyed a stage route from Salt Lake\r\nCity to Denver, and this is the place where he crossed the Green River.\r\nHis party was encamped here for some time, constructing a ferry boat and\r\nopening a road.\r\n\r\nA little above the mouth of the Uinta, on the west side of the Green,\r\nthere is a lake of several thousand acres. We carry our boat across the\r\ndivide between this and the river, have a row on its quiet waters, and\r\nsucceed in shooting several ducks.\r\n\r\nJune 29.--A mile and three quarters from here is the junction of the\r\nWhite River with the Green. The White has its source far to the east in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. This morning I cross the Green and go over into the\r\nvalley of the White and extend my walk several miles along its winding\r\nway, until at last I come in sight of some strangely carved rocks, named\r\nby General Hughes, in his journal, \"Goblin City.\" Our last winter's camp\r\nwas situated a hundred miles above the point reached to-day. The course\r\nof the river, for much of the distance, is through canyons; but at some\r\nplaces valleys are found. Excepting these little valleys, the region\r\nis one of great desolation: arid, almost treeless, with bluffs, hills,\r\nledges of rock, and drifting sands. Along the course of the Green,\r\nhowever, from the foot of Split Mountain Canyon to a point some distance\r\nbelow the mouth of the Uinta, there are many groves of cottonwood,\r\nnatural meadows, and rich lands. This arable belt extends some distance\r\nup the White River on the east and the Uinta on the west, and the time\r\nmust soon come when settlers will penetrate this country and make homes.\r\n\r\nJune 30.--We have a row up the Uinta to-day, but are not able to make\r\nmuch headway against the swift current, and hence conclude we must walk\r\nall the way to the agency.\r\n\r\nFROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF UINTA RIVER.\r\n\r\n183\r\n\r\nJuly 1.--Two days have been employed in obtaining the local time, taking\r\nobservations for latitude and longitude, and making excursions into the\r\nadjacent country. This morning, with two of the men, I start for the\r\nagency. It is a toilsome walk, 20 miles of the distance being across a\r\nsand desert. Occasionally we have to wade the river, crossing it\r\nback and forth. Toward evening we cross several beautiful streams,\r\npowell-canyons-124.jpg\r\n\r\nWARRIOR AND BRIDE.\r\n\r\ntributaries of the Uinta, and pass through pine groves and meadows,\r\narriving at the reservation just at dusk. Captain Dodds, the agent, is\r\naway, having gone to Salt Lake City, but his assistants receive us\r\nvery kindly. It is rather pleasant to see a house once more, and some\r\nevidences of civilization, even if it is on an Indian reservation\r\nseveral days' ride from the nearest home of the white man. July 2.--I go\r\nthis morning to visit Tsauwiat. This old chief is\r\n\r\n184 4 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nbut the wreck of a man, and no longer has influence. Looking at him one\r\ncan scarcely realize that he is a man. His skin is shrunken, wrinkled,\r\nand dry, and seems to cover no more than a form of bones. He is said\r\nto be more than 100 years old. I talk a little with him, but his\r\nconversation is incoherent, though he seems to take pride in showing me\r\nsome medals that must have been given him many years ago. He has a pipe\r\nwhich he says he has used a long time. I offer to exchange with him,\r\nand he seems to be glad to accept; so I add another to my collection of\r\npipes. His wife, \"The Bishop,\" as she is called, is a very garrulous\r\nold woman; she exerts a great influence, and is much revered. She is the\r\nonly Indian woman I have known to occupy a place in the council ring.\r\nShe seems very much younger than her husband, and, though wrinkled\r\nand ugly, is still vigorous. She has much to say to me concerning the\r\ncondition of the people, and seems very anxious that they should learn\r\nto cultivate the soil, own farms, and live like white men. After talking\r\na couple of hours with these old people, I go to see the farms. They are\r\nsituated in a very beautiful district, where many fine streams of\r\nwater meander across alluvial plains and meadows. These creeks have a\r\nconsiderable fall, and it is easy to take their waters out above and\r\noverflow the lands with them.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that irrigation is necessary in this dry climate\r\nto successful farming. Quite a number of Indians have each a patch of\r\nground of two or three acres, on which they are raising wheat, potatoes,\r\nturnips, pumpkins, melons, and other vegetables. Most of the crops are\r\nlooking well, and it is rather surprising with what pride they show us\r\nthat they are able to cultivate crops like white men. They are still\r\noccupying lodges, and refuse to build houses, assigning as a reason\r\nthat when any one dies in a lodge it is always abandoned, and very often\r\nburned with all the effects of the deceased; and when houses have been\r\nbuilt for them the houses have been treated in the same way. With their\r\nunclean habits, a fixed residence would doubtless be no pleasant place.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful valley has been the home of a people of a higher grade\r\nof civilization than the present Utes. Evidences of this are quite\r\nabundant; on our way here yesterday we discovered fragments\r\n\r\nFROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF UINTA RIVER. 185\r\n\r\nof pottery in many places along the trail; and, wandering about the\r\nlittle farms to-day, I find the foundations of ancient houses, and\r\nmealing-stones that were not used by nomadic people, as they are\r\ntoo heavy to be transported by such tribes, and are deeply worn. The\r\npowell-canyons-125.jpg\r\n\r\nOUR INTERPRETER AND HIS FAMILY.\r\n\r\nIndians, seeing that I am interested in these matters, take pains to\r\nshow me several other places where these evidences remain, and tell me\r\nthat they know nothing about the people who formerly dwelt here.\r\nThey further tell me that up in the canyon the rocks are covered with\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nJuly 5.--The last two days have been spent in studying the language\r\n\r\n186 powell-canyons-126.jpg\r\n\r\nHOUSE BUILDING AT ORAIBI.\r\n\r\nPROM ECHO PARK TO THE MOUTH OF UINTA RIVER. 187\r\n\r\nof the Indians and in making collections of articles illustrating the\r\nstate of arts among them.\r\n\r\nFrank Goodman informs me this morning that he has concluded not to go\r\non with the party, saying that he has seen danger enough. It will be\r\nremembered that he was one of the crew on the \"No Name\" when she was\r\nwrecked. As our boats are rather heavily loaded, I am content that he\r\nshould leave, although he has been a faithful man.\r\n\r\nWe start early on our return to the boats, taking horses with us from\r\nthe reservation, and two Indians, who are to bring the animals back.\r\n\r\nWhirlpool Canyon is 14 1/4 miles in length, the walls varying from 1,800\r\nto 2,400 feet in height. The course of the river through Island Park is\r\n9 miles. Split Mountain Canyon is 8 miles long. The highest crags on its\r\nwalls reach an altitude above the river of from 2,500 to 2,700 feet. In\r\nthese canyons cedars only are found on the walls.\r\n\r\nThe distance by river from the foot of Split Mountain Canyon to the\r\nmouth of the Uinta is 67 miles. The valley through which it runs is\r\nthe home of many antelope, and we have adopted for it the Indian name\r\nWon'sits Yuav--Antelope Valley. powell-canyons-127.jpg\r\n\r\n188 powell-canyons-128.jpg\r\n\r\nGENERAL VIEW OF OJO CALIENTE.\r\n\r\n189\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFROM THE MOUTH OF THE UINTA RIVER TO THE JUNCTION OF THE\r\n\r\nGRAND AND GREEN.\r\n\r\nJULY 6.--An early start this morning. A short distance below the mouth\r\nof the Uinta we come to the head of a long island. Last winter a man\r\nnamed Johnson, a hunter and Indian trader, visited us at our camp in\r\nWhite River Valley. This man has an Indian wife, and, having no fixed\r\nhome, usually travels with one of the Ute bands. He informed me that it\r\nwas his intention to plant some corn, potatoes, and other vegetables on\r\nthis island in the spring, and, knowing that we would pass it, invited\r\nus to stop and help ourselves, even if he should not be there; so we\r\nland and go out on the island. Looking about, we soon discover his\r\ngarden, but it is in a sad condition, having received no care since\r\nit was planted. It is yet too early in the season for corn, but Hall\r\nsuggests that potato tops are good greens, and, anxious for some change\r\nfrom our salt-meat fare, we gather a quantity and take them aboard. At\r\nnoon we stop and cook our greens for dinner; but soon one after another\r\nof the party is taken sick; nausea first, and then severe vomiting, and\r\nwe tumble around under the trees, groaning with pain. I feel a little\r\nalarmed, lest our poisoning be severe. Emetics are administered to those\r\nwho are willing to take them, and about the middle of the afternoon we\r\nare all rid of the pain. Jack Sumner records in his diary that \"potato\r\ntops are not good greens on the 6th day of July.\"\r\n\r\nThis evening we enter another canyon, almost imperceptibly, as the walls\r\nrise very gently.\r\n\r\nJuly 7.--We find quiet water to-day, the river sweeping in great and\r\nbeautiful curves, the canyon walls steadily increasing in altitude.\r\nThe escarpments formed by the cut edges of the rock are often vertical,\r\nsometimes terraced, and in some places the treads of the terraces\r\n\r\n190\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nare sloping. In these quiet curves vast amphitheaters are formed, now in\r\nvertical rocks, now in steps.\r\n\r\nThe salient point of rock within the curve is usually broken down in a\r\nsteep slope, and we stop occasionally to climb up at such a place, where\r\non looking down we can see the river sweeping the foot of the opposite\r\ncliff in a great, easy curve, with a perpendicular or terraced wall\r\nrising from the water's edge many hundreds of feet. One of these we\r\nfind very symmetrical and name it Sumner's Amphitheater. The cliffs are\r\nrarely broken by the entrance of side canyons, and we sweep around curve\r\nafter curve with almost continuous walls for several miles.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we find the river very much rougher and come upon\r\nrapids, not dangerous, but still demanding close attention. We camp at\r\nnight on the right bank, having made 26 miles. July 8.--This morning\r\nBradley and I go out to climb, and gain an altitude of more than 2,000\r\nfeet above the river, but still do not reach the summit of the wall.\r\npowell-canyons-129.jpg\r\n\r\nSUMNER'S AMPHITHEATER.\r\n\r\nFROM THE UINTA TO THE GRAND. 191\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we pass through a region of the wildest desolation. The\r\ncanyon is very tortuous, the river very rapid, and many lateral canyons\r\nenter on either side. These usually have their branches, so that the\r\nregion is cut into a wilderness of gray and brown cliffs. In several\r\nplaces these lateral canyons are separated from one another only by\r\nnarrow walls, often hundreds of feet high,--so narrow in places that\r\nwhere softer rocks are found below they have crumbled away and left\r\nholes in the wall, forming passages from one canyon into another. These\r\nwe often call natural bridges; but they were never intended to span\r\nstreams. They would better, perhaps, be called side doors between\r\ncanyon chambers. Piles of broken rock lie against these walls; crags and\r\ntower-shaped peaks are seen everywhere, and away above them, long lines\r\nof broken cliffs; and above and beyond the cliffs are pine forests, of\r\nwhich we obtain occasional glimpses as we look up through a vista of\r\nrocks. The walls are almost without vegetation; a few dwarf bushes are\r\nseen here and there clinging to the rocks, and cedars grow from the\r\ncrevices--not like the cedars of a land refreshed with rains, great\r\ncones bedecked with spray, but ugly clumps, like war clubs beset with\r\nspines. We are minded to call this the Canyon of Desolation.\r\n\r\nThe wind annoys us much to-day. The water, rough by reason of the\r\nrapids, is made more so by head gales. Wherever a great face of rocks\r\nhas a southern exposure, the rarefied air rises and the wind rushes in\r\nbelow, either up or down the canyon, or both, causing local currents.\r\nJust at sunset we run a bad rapid and camp at its foot.\r\n\r\nJuly 9.--Our run to-day is through a canyon with ragged, broken walls,\r\nmany lateral gulches or canyons entering on either side. The river is\r\nrough, and occasionally it becomes necessary to use lines in passing\r\nrocky places. During the afternoon we come to a rather open canyon\r\nvalley, stretching up toward the west, its farther end lost in the\r\nmountains. From a point to which we climb we obtain a good view of its\r\ncourse, until its angular walls are lost in the vista.\r\n\r\nJuly 10.--Sumner, who is a fine mechanic, is learning to take\r\nobservations for time with the sextant. To-day he remains in camp to\r\npractice. Howland and I determine to climb out, and start up a lateral\r\ncanyon, taking a barometer with us for the purpose of measuring the\r\nthickness\r\n\r\n192 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nof the strata over which we pass. The readings of the barometer below\r\nare recorded every half hour and our observations must be simultaneous.\r\nWhere the beds which we desire to measure are very thick, we must climb\r\nwith the utmost speed to reach their summits in time; where the beds are\r\nthinner, we must wait for the moment to arrive; and so, by hard and\r\neasy stages, we make our way to the top of the canyon wall and reach the\r\nplateau above about two o' clock.\r\n\r\nHowland, who has his gun with him, sees deer feeding a mile or two back\r\nand goes off for a hunt. I go to a peak which seems to be the highest\r\none in this region, about half a mile distant, and climb, for-the\r\npurpose of tracing the topography of the adjacent country. From this\r\npoint a fine view is obtained. A long plateau stretches across the\r\nriver in an easterly and westerly direction, the summit covered by pine\r\nforests, with intervening elevated valleys and gulches. The plateau\r\nitself is cut in two by the canyon. Other side canyons head away back\r\nfrom the river and run down into the Green. Besides these, deep and\r\nabrupt canyons are seen to head back on the plateau and run north toward\r\nthe Uinta and White rivers. Still other canyons head in the valleys and\r\nrun toward the south. The elevation of the plateau being about 8,000\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, it is in a region of moisture, as is\r\nwell attested by the forests and grassy valleys. The plateau seems to\r\nrise gradually to the west, until it merges into the Wasatch Mountains.\r\nOn these high table-lands elk and deer abound; and they are favorite\r\nhunting grounds for the Ute Indians.\r\n\r\n193\r\n\r\nA little before sunset Howland and I meet again at the head of the side\r\ncanyon, and down we start. It is late, and we must make great haste or\r\nbe caught by the darkness; so we go, running where we can, leaping over\r\nthe ledges, letting each other down on the loose rocks, as long as we\r\ncan see. When darkness comes we are still some distance from camp, and a\r\nlong, slow, anxious descent is made toward the gleaming camp fire.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, observations for latitude are taken, and only two or three\r\nhours for sleep remain before daylight.\r\n\r\nJuly 11.--A short distance below camp we run a rapid, and in doing so\r\nbreak an oar and then lose another, both belonging to the \"Emma Dean.\"\r\nNow the pioneer boat has but two oars. We see nothing from\r\n\r\n194 powell-canyons-130.jpg\r\n\r\nCHIMNEYS AND ROOFS, ZUNI. powell-canyons-131.jpg\r\n\r\nA TUSAYAN INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nFROM THE UINTA TO THE GRAND. 195\r\n\r\nwhich oars can be made, so we conclude to run on to some point where it\r\nseems possible to climb out to the forests on the plateau, and there we\r\nwill procure suitable timber from which to make new ones.\r\n\r\nWe soon approach another rapid. Standing on deck, I think it can be run,\r\nand on we go. Coming nearer, I see that at the foot it has a short turn\r\nto the left, where the waters pile up against the cliff. Here we try to\r\nland, but quickly discover that, being in swift water above the fall, we\r\ncannot reach shore, crippled as we are by the loss of two oars; so the\r\nbow of the boat is turned down stream. We shoot by a big rock; a reflex\r\nwave rolls over our little boat and fills her. I see that the place is\r\ndangerous and quickly signal to the other boats to land where they can.\r\nThis is scarcely completed when another wave rolls our boat over and\r\nI am thrown some distance into the water. I soon find that swimming\r\nis very easy and I cannot sink. It is only necessary to ply strokes\r\nsufficient to keep my head out of the water, though now and then, when\r\na breaker rolls over me, I close my mouth and am carried through it.\r\nThe boat is drifting ahead of me 20 or 30 feet, and when the great waves\r\nhave passed I overtake her and find Sumner and Dunn clinging to her. As\r\nsoon as we reach quiet water we all swim to one side and turn her over.\r\nIn doing this, Dunn loses his hold and goes under; when he comes up\r\nhe is caught by Sumner and pulled to the boat. In the meantime we have\r\ndrifted down stream some distance and see another rapid below. How bad\r\nit may be we cannot tell; so we swim toward shore, pulling our boat with\r\nus, with all the vigor possible, but are carried down much faster than\r\ndistance toward shore is diminished. At last we reach a huge pile of\r\ndriftwood. Our rolls of blankets, two guns, and a barometer were in the\r\nopen compartment of the boat and, when it went over, these were thrown\r\nout. The guns and barometer are lost, but I succeeded in catching one\r\nof the rolls of blankets as it drifted down, when we were swimming to\r\nshore; the other two are lost, and sometimes hereafter we may sleep\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nA huge fire is built on the bank and our clothing spread to dry, and\r\nthen from the drift logs we select one from which we think oars can be\r\nmade, and the remainder of the day is spent in sawing them out.\r\n\r\nJuly 12.--This morning the new oars are finished and we start once more.\r\nWe pass several bad rapids, making a short portage at one, and\r\n\r\n196 6 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nbefore noon we come to a long, bad fall, where the channel is filled\r\nwith rocks on the left which turn the waters to the right, where they\r\npass under an overhanging rock. On examination we determine to run it,\r\nkeeping as close to the left-hand rocks as safety will permit, in order\r\nto avoid the overhanging cliff. The little boat runs over all right;\r\nanother follows, but the men are not able to keep her near enough to the\r\nleft bank and she is carried by a swift chute into great waves to the\r\nright, where she is tossed about and Bradley is knocked over the side;\r\nhis foot catching under the seat, he is dragged along in the water with\r\nhis head down; making great exertion, he seizes the gunwale with his\r\nleft hand and can lift his head above water now and then. To us who\r\nare below, it seems impossible to keep the boat from going under the\r\noverhanging cliff; but Powell, for the moment heedless of Bradley's\r\nmishap, pulls with all his power for half a dozen strokes, when the\r\ndanger is past; then he seizes Bradley and pulls him in. The men in the\r\nboat above, seeing this, land, and she is let down by lines.\r\n\r\nJust here we emerge from the Canyon of Desolation, as we have named it,\r\ninto a more open country, which extends for a distance of nearly a mile,\r\nwhen we enter another canyon cut through gray sandstone.\r\n\r\nAbout three o'clock in the afternoon we meet with a new difficulty. The\r\nriver fills the entire channel; the walls are vertical on either side\r\nfrom the water's edge, and a bad rapid is beset with rocks. We come to\r\nthe head of it and land on a rock in the stream. The little boat is let\r\ndown to another rock below, the men of the larger boat holding to the\r\nline; the second boat is let down in the same way, and the line of the\r\nthird boat is brought with them. Now the third boat pushes out from the\r\nupper rock, and, as we have her line below, we pull in and catch her as\r\nshe is sweeping by at the foot of the rock on which we stand. Again the\r\nfirst boat is let down stream the full length of her line and the second\r\nboat is passed down, by the first to the extent of her line, which is\r\nheld by the men in the first boat; so she is two lines' length from\r\nwhere she started. Then the third boat is let down past the second, and\r\nstill down, nearly to the length of her line, so that she is fast to the\r\nsecond boat and swinging down three lines' lengths, with the other two\r\nboats intervening. Held in this way, the men\r\n\r\nFROM THE UINTA TO THE GRAND.\r\n\r\n197\r\n\r\nare able to pull her into a cove in the left wall, where she is made\r\nfast. But this leaves a man on the rock above, holding to the line of\r\nthe little boat. When all is ready, he springs from the rock, clinging\r\nto the line with one hand and swimming with the other, and we pull him\r\nin as he goes by. As the two boats, thus loosened, drift down, the men\r\npowell-canyons-132.jpg\r\n\r\nLIGHTHOUSE ROCK, CANYON OF DESOLATION.\r\n\r\nin the cove pull us all in as we come opposite; then we pass around to\r\na point of rock below the cove, close to the wall, land, make a short\r\nportage over the worst places in the rapid, and start again.\r\n\r\nAt night we camp on a sand beach. The wind blows a hurricane; the\r\ndrifting sand almost blinds us; and nowhere can we find shelter. The\r\nwind continues to blow all night, the sand sifting through our blankets\r\n\r\n198 8 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nand piling over us until we are covered as in a snowdrift. We are glad\r\nwhen morning comes.\r\n\r\nJuly 13.--This morning we have an exhilarating ride. The river is swift,\r\nand there are many smooth rapids. I stand on deck, keeping careful watch\r\nahead, and we glide along, mile after mile, plying strokes, now on the\r\nright and then on the left, just sufficient to guide our boats past the\r\nrocks into smooth water. At noon we emerge from Gray Canyon, as we have\r\nnamed it, and camp for dinner under a cotton-wood tree standing on the\r\nleft bank.\r\n\r\nExtensive sand plains extend back from the immediate river valley as\r\nfar as we can see on either side. These naked, drifting sands gleam\r\nbrilliantly in the midday sun of July. The reflected heat from the\r\nglaring surface produces a curious motion of the atmosphere; little\r\ncurrents are generated and the whole seems to be trembling and moving\r\nabout in many directions, or, failing to see that the movement is in\r\nthe atmosphere, it gives the impression of an unstable land. Plains and\r\nhills and cliffs and distant mountains seem to be floating vaguely about\r\nin a trembling, wave-rocked sea, and patches of landscape seem to float\r\naway and be lost, and then to reappear.\r\n\r\nJust opposite, there are buttes, outliers of cliffs to the left. Below,\r\nthey are composed of shales and marls of light blue and slate colors;\r\nabove, the rocks are buff and gray, and then brown. The buttes are\r\nbuttressed below, where the azure rocks are seen, and terraced\r\nabove through the gray and brown beds. A long line of cliffs or rock\r\nescarpments separates the table-lands through which Gray Canyon is cut,\r\nfrom the lower plain. The eye can trace these azure beds and cliffs on\r\neither side of the river, in a long line extending across its course,\r\nuntil they fade away in the perspective. These cliffs are many miles\r\nin length and hundreds of feet high; and all these buttes--great\r\nmountain-masses of rock--are dancing and fading away and reappearing,\r\nsoftly moving about,--or so they seem to the eye as seen through the\r\nshifting atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon our way is through a valley with cottonwood groves on\r\neither side. The river is deep, broad, and quiet. About two hours after\r\nnoon camp we discover an Indian crossing, where a number of rafts,\r\nrudely constructed of logs and bound together by withes, are\r\n\r\nFROM THE UINTA TO THE GRAND.\r\n\r\n199\r\n\r\nfloating against the bank. On landing, we see evidences that a party of\r\nIndians have crossed within a very few days. This is the place where the\r\nlamented Gunnison crossed, in the year 1853, when making an exploration\r\nfor a railroad route to the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nAn hour later we run a long rapid and stop at its foot to examine some\r\ninteresting rocks, deposited by mineral springs that at one time must\r\nhave existed here, but which are no longer flowing.\r\n\r\nJuly 14.-- This morning we pass some curious black bluffs on the right,\r\nthen two or three short canyons, and then we discover the mouth of the\r\nSan Rafael, a stream which comes down from the distant mountains in\r\nthe west. Here we stop for an hour or two and take a short walk up the\r\nvalley, and find it is a frequent resort for Indians. Arrowheads are\r\nscattered about, many of them very beautiful; flint chips are strewn\r\nover the ground in great profusion, and the trails are well worn.\r\n\r\nStarting after dinner, we pass some beautiful buttes on the left, many\r\npowell-canyons-133.jpg\r\n\r\nGUNNISON BUTTE. GRAY CANYON (2,700 FEET HIGH).\r\n\r\n200 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nof which are very symmetrical. They are chiefly composed of gypsum, of\r\nmany hues, from light gray to slate color; then pink, purple, and brown\r\nbeds. Now we enter another canyon. Gradually the walls rise higher and\r\nhigher as we proceed, and the summit of the canyon is formed of the same\r\nbeds of orange-colored sandstone. Back from the brink the hollows of the\r\nplateau are filled with sands disintegrated from these orange beds. They\r\nare of a rich cream color, shading into maroon, everywhere destitute of\r\nvegetation, and drifted into long, wave-like ridges.\r\n\r\nThe course of the river is tortuous, and it nearly doubles upon itself\r\nmany times. The water is quiet, and constant rowing is necessary to make\r\nmuch headway. Sometimes there is a narrow flood plain between the river\r\nand the wall, on one side or the other. Where these long, gentle curves\r\nare found, the river washes the very foot of the outer wall. A long\r\npeninsula of willow-bordered meadow projects within the curve, and the\r\ntalus at the foot of the cliff is usually covered with dwarf oaks. The\r\norange-colored sandstone is homogeneous in structure, and the walls are\r\nusually vertical, though not very high. Where the river sweeps around a\r\ncurve under a cliff, a vast hollow dome may be seen, with many caves and\r\ndeep alcoves, which are greatly admired by the members of the party as\r\nwe go by.\r\n\r\nWe camp at night on the left bank.\r\n\r\nJuly 15.---Our camp is in a great bend of the canyon. The curve is to\r\nthe west and we are on the east side of the river. Just opposite, a\r\nlittle stream comes down through a narrow side canyon. We cross and go\r\nup to explore it. At its mouth another lateral canyon enters, in the\r\nangle between the former and the main canyon above. Still another\r\nenters in the angle between the canyon below and the side canyon first\r\nmentioned; so that three side canyons enter at the same point. These\r\ncanyons are very tortuous, almost closed in from view, and, seen from\r\nthe opposite side of the river, they appear like three alcoves. We name\r\nthis Trin-Alcove Bend.\r\n\r\nGoing up the little stream in the central cove, we pass between high\r\nwalls of sandstone, and wind about in glens. Springs gush from the rocks\r\nat the foot of the walls; narrow passages in the rocks are threaded,\r\ncaves are entered, and many side canyons are observed.\r\n\r\n201 powell-canyons-134.jpg\r\n\r\nRUINS OF KETCHIPAUAN.\r\n\r\n202 powell-canyons-135.jpg\r\n\r\nBIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THE LAND OF THE STANDING ROCKS.\r\n\r\nFROM THE UINTA TO THE GRAND. 203\r\n\r\nThe right cove is a narrow, winding gorge, with overhanging walls,\r\nalmost shutting out the light. The left is an amphitheater, turning\r\nspirally up, with overhanging shelves. A series of basins filled with\r\nwater are seen at different altitudes as we pass up; huge rocks are\r\npiled below on the right, and overhead there is an arched ceiling. After\r\nexploring these alcoves, we recross the river and climb the rounded\r\nrocks on the point of the bend. In every direction, as far as we are\r\nable to see, naked rocks appear. Buttes are scattered on the landscape,\r\nhere rounded into cones, there buttressed, columned, and carved in\r\nquaint shapes, with deep alcoves and sunken recesses. All about us are\r\nbasins, excavated in the soft sandstone; and these have been filled by\r\nthe late rains.\r\n\r\nOver the rounded rocks and water pockets we look off on a fine Stretch\r\nof river, and beyond are naked rocks and beautiful buttes leading the\r\neye to the Azure Cliffs, and beyond these and above them the Brown\r\nCliffs, and still beyond, mountain peaks; and clouds piled over all.\r\n\r\nOn we go, after dinner, with quiet water, still compelled to row in\r\norder to make fair progress. The canyon is yet very tortuous. About six\r\nmiles below noon camp we go around a great bend to the right, five miles\r\nin length, and come back to a point within a quarter of a mile of where\r\nwe started. Then we sweep around another great bend to the left, making\r\na circuit of nine miles, and come back to a point within 600 yards of\r\nthe beginning of the bend. In the two circuits we describe almost the\r\nfigure 8. The men call it a \"bowknot\" of river; so we name it Bowknot\r\nBend. The line of the figure is 14 miles in length.\r\n\r\nThere is an exquisite charm in our ride to-day down this beautiful\r\ncanyon. It gradually grows deeper with every mile of travel; the walls\r\nare symmetrically curved and grandly arched, of a beautiful color, and\r\nreflected in the quiet waters in many places so as almost to deceive\r\nthe eye and suggest to the beholder the thought that he is looking into\r\nprofound depths. We are all in fine spirits and feel very gay, and the\r\nbadinage of the men is echoed from wall to wall. Now and then we whistle\r\nor shout or discharge a pistol, to listen to the reverberations among\r\nthe cliffs.\r\n\r\nAt night we camp on the south side of the great Bowknot, and as\r\n\r\n204\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nwe eat supper, which is spread on the beach, we name this Labyrinth\r\nCanyon.\r\n\r\nJuly 16.--Still we go down on our winding way. Tower cliffs are passed;\r\nthen the river widens out for several miles, and meadows are seen on\r\neither side between the river and the walls. We name this expansion of\r\nthe river Tower Park. At two o'clock we emerge from Labyrinth Canyon and\r\ngo into camp.\r\n\r\nJuly 17.--The line which separates Labyrinth Canyon from the one below\r\nis but a line, and at once, this morning, we enter another canyon. The\r\nwater fills the entire channel, so that nowhere is there room to land.\r\nThe walls are low, but vertical, and as we proceed they gradually\r\nincrease in altitude. Running a couple of miles, the river changes its\r\ncourse many degrees toward the east. Just here a little stream comes in\r\non the right and the wall is broken down; so we land and go out to take\r\npowell-canyons-136.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE BUTTE OF THE CEOSS.\r\n\r\na view of the surrounding country. We are now down among the buttes, and\r\nin a region the surface of which is naked, solid rock--a beautiful red\r\nsandstone, forming a smooth, undulating pavement. The Indians call this\r\nthe Toom'pin Tuweap', or \"Rock Land,\" and sometimes the Toom'pin wunear1\r\nTuweap', or \"Land of Standing Rock.\"\r\n\r\nOff to the south we see a butte in the form of a fallen cross. It is\r\nseveral miles away, but it presents no inconspicuous figure on the\r\n\r\n205 powell-canyons-137.jpg\r\n\r\nLAND OF THE STANDING ROCKS.\r\n\r\n206 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nlandscape and must be many hundreds of feet high, probably more than\r\n2,000. We note its position on our map and name it \"The Butte of the\r\nCross.\"\r\n\r\nWe continue our journey. In many places the walls, which rise from the\r\nwater's edge, are overhanging on either side. The stream is still quiet,\r\nand we glide along through a strange, weird, grand region. The landscape\r\neverywhere, away from the river, is of rock--cliffs of rock, tables of\r\nrock, plateaus of rock, terraces of rock, crags of rock--ten thousand\r\nstrangely carved forms; rocks everywhere, and no vegetation, no soil, no\r\nsand. In long, gentle curves the river winds about these rocks.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking of these rocks one must not conceive of piles of boulders\r\nor heaps of fragments, but of a whole land of naked rock, with giant\r\nforms carved on it: cathedral-shaped buttes, towering hundreds or\r\nthousands of feet, cliffs that cannot be scaled, and canyon walls that\r\nshrink the river into insignificance, with vast, hollow domes and\r\ntall pinnacles and shafts set on the verge overhead; and all highly\r\ncolored--buff, gray, red, brown, and chocolate--never lichened, never\r\nmoss-covered, but bare, and often polished.\r\n\r\nWe pass a place where two bends of the river come together, an\r\nintervening rock having been worn away and a new channel formed across.\r\nThe old channel ran in a great circle around to the right, by what was\r\nonce a circular peninsula, then an island; then the water left the old\r\nchannel entirely and passed through the cut, and the old bed of\r\nthe river is dry. So the great circular rock stands by itself, with\r\nprecipitous walls all about it, and we find but one place where it can\r\nbe scaled. Looking from its summit, a long stretch of river is seen,\r\nsweeping close to the overhanging cliffs on the right, but having a\r\nlittle meadow between it and the wall on the left. The curve is very\r\ngentle and regular. We name this Bonita Bend.\r\n\r\nAnd just here we climb out once more, to take another bearing on The\r\nButte of the Cross. Reaching an eminence from which we can overlook the\r\nlandscape, we are surprised to find that our butte, with its wonderful\r\nform, is indeed two buttes, one so standing in front of the other that\r\nfrom our last point of view it gave the appearance of a cross.\r\n\r\nA few miles below Bonita Bend we go out again a mile or two\r\n\r\n207 powell-canyons-138.jpg\r\n\r\nMOENKOPI.\r\n\r\n208 powell-canyons-139.jpg\r\n\r\nORAIBI HOUSES.\r\n\r\nFROM THE UINTA TO THE GRAND. 209\r\n\r\namong the rocks, toward the Orange Cliffs, passing over terraces paved\r\nwith jasper. The cliffs are not far away and we soon reach them, and\r\nwander in some deep, painted alcoves which attracted our attention from\r\nthe river; then we return to our boats.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the water becomes swift and our boats make great\r\nspeed.. An hour of this rapid running brings us to the junction of the\r\nGrand and Green, the foot of Stillwater Canyon, as we have named it.\r\nThese streams-unite in solemn depths, more than 1,200 feet below the\r\ngeneral surface of the country. The walls of the lower end of Stillwater\r\nCanyon are very beautifully curved, as the river sweeps in its\r\nmeandering course. The lower end of the canyon through which the Grand\r\ncomes down is also regular, but much more direct, and we look up this\r\nstream and out into the country beyond and obtain glimpses of snow-clad\r\npeaks, the summits of a group of mountains known as the Sierra La Sal.\r\nDown the Colorado the canyon walls are much broken.\r\n\r\nWe row around into the Grand and camp on its northwest bank; and here\r\nwe propose to stay several days, for the purpose of determining the\r\nlatitude and longitude and the altitude of the walls. Much of the night\r\nis spent in making observations with the sextant.\r\n\r\nThe distance from the mouth of the Uinta to the head of the Canyon of\r\nDesolation is 20 3/4 miles. The Canyon of Desolation is 97 miles long;\r\nGray Canyon, 36 miles. The course of the river through Gunnison Valley\r\nis 27 1/4 miles; Labyrinth Canyon, 62 1/2 miles.\r\n\r\nIn the Canyon of Desolation the highest rocks immediately over the river\r\nare about 2,400 feet. This is at Log Cabin Cliff. The highest part\r\nof the terrace is near the brink of the Brown Cliffs. Climbing the\r\nimmediate walls of the canyon and passing back to the canyon terrace and\r\nclimbing that, we find the altitude above the river to be 3,300 feet.\r\nThe lower end of Gray Canyon is about 2,000 feet; the lower end of\r\nLabyrinth Canyon, 1,300 feet.\r\n\r\nStillwater Canyon is 42 3/4 miles long; the highest walls, 1,300 feet.\r\n\r\n210 powell-canyons-140.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE HEART OF MARBLE CANYON.\r\n\r\n211\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFROM THE JUNCTION OF THE GRAND AND GREEN TO THE MOUTH OF THE LITTLE\r\nCOLORADO.\r\n\r\nJULY 18.--The day is spent in obtaining the time and spreading our\r\nrations, which we find are badly injured. The flour has been wet and\r\ndried so many times that it is all musty and full of hard lumps. We make\r\na sieve of mosquito netting and run our flour through, it, losing more\r\nthan 200 pounds by the process. Our losses, by the wrecking of the \"No\r\nName,\" and by various mishaps since, together with the amount thrown\r\naway to-day, leave us little more than two months' supplies, and to make\r\nthem last thus long we must be fortunate enough to lose no more.\r\n\r\nWe drag our boats on shore and turn them over to recalk and pitch them,\r\nand Sumner is engaged in repairing barometers. While we are here for a\r\nday or two, resting, we propose to put everything in the best shape for\r\na vigorous campaign.\r\n\r\nJuly 19.--Bradley and I start this morning to climb the left wall below\r\nthe junction. The way we have selected is up a gulch. Climbing for an\r\nhour over and among the rocks, we find ourselves in a vast amphitheater\r\nand our way cut off. We clamber around to the left for half an hour,\r\nuntil we find that we cannot go up in that direction. Then we try the\r\nrocks around to the right and discover a narrow shelf nearly half a mile\r\nlong. In some places this is so wide that we pass along with ease; in\r\nothers it is so narrow and sloping that we are compelled to lie down and\r\ncrawl. We can look over the edge of the shelf, down 800 feet, and see\r\nthe river rolling and plunging among the rocks. Looking up 500 feet\r\nto the brink of the cliff, it seems to blend with the sky. We continue\r\nalong until we come to a point where the wall is again broken down. Up\r\nwe climb. On the right there is a narrow, mural point\r\n\r\n212 2 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nof rocks, extending toward the river, 200 or 300 feet high and 600 or\r\n800 feet long. We come back to where this sets in and find it cut off\r\nfrom the main wall by a great crevice. Into this we pass; and now a\r\nlong, narrow rock is between us and the river. The rock itself is split\r\nlongitudinally and transversely; and the rains on the surface above have\r\nrun down through the crevices and gathered into channels below and then\r\nrun off into the river. The crevices are usually narrow above and, by\r\nerosion of the streams, wider below, forming a network of \"caves\", each\r\ncave having a narrow, winding skylight up through the rocks. We wander\r\namong these corridors for an hour or two, but find no place where the\r\nrocks are broken down so that we can climb up. At last we determine to\r\nattempt a passage by a crevice, and select one which we think is wide\r\nenough to admit of the passage of our bodies and yet narrow enough to\r\nclimb out by pressing our hands and feet against the walls. So we\r\nclimb as men would out of a well. Bradley climbs first; I hand him the\r\nbarometer, then climb over his head and he hands me the barometer. So we\r\npass each other alternately until we emerge from the fissure, out on the\r\nsummit of the rock. And what a world of grandeur is spread before us!\r\nBelow is the canyon through which the Colorado runs. We can trace its\r\ncourse for miles, and at points catch glimpses of the river. From the\r\nnorthwest comes the Green in a narrow winding gorge. From the northeast\r\ncomes the Grand, through a canyon that seems bottomless from where we\r\nstand. Away to the west are lines of cliffs and ledges of rock--not\r\nsuch ledges as the reader may have seen where the quarryman splits his\r\nblocks, but ledges from which the gods might quarry mountains that,\r\nrolled out on the plain below, would stand a lofty range; and not such\r\ncliffs as the reader may have seen where the swallow builds its nest,\r\nbut cliffs where the soaring eagle is lost to view ere he reaches the\r\nsummit. Between us and the distant cliffs are the strangely carved and\r\npinnacled rocks of the Toom'pin wunear' Tuweap'. On the summit of the\r\nopposite wall of the canyon are rock forms that we do not understand.\r\nAway to the east a group of eruptive mountains are seen--the Sierra La\r\nSal, which we first saw two days ago through the canyon of the Grand.\r\nTheir slopes are covered with pines, and deep gulches are flanked with\r\ngreat crags, and snow fields are seen near the summits. So the moun-\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO.\r\n\r\n213\r\n\r\ntains are in uniform,--green, gray, and silver. Wherever we look there\r\nis but a wilderness of rocks,--deep gorges where the rivers are lost\r\nbelow cliffs and towers and pinnacles, and ten thousand strangely carved\r\nforms in every direction, and beyond them mountains blending with the\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nNow we return to camp. While eating supper we very naturally speak of\r\nbetter fare, as musty bread and spoiled bacon are not palatable. Soon\r\nI see Hawkins down by the boat, taking up the sextant--rather a strange\r\nproceeding for him--and I question him concerning it. He replies that he\r\nis trying to find the latitude and longitude of the nearest pie.\r\n\r\nJuly 20.--This morning Captain Powell and I go out to climb the west\r\nwall of the canyon, for the purpose of examining the strange rocks seen\r\nyesterday from the other side. Two hours bring us to the top, at a point\r\nbetween the Green and Colorado overlooking the junction of the rivers.\r\n\r\nA long neck of rock extends toward the mouth of the Grand. Out on this\r\nwe walk, crossing a great number of deep crevices. Usually the\r\nsmooth rock slopes down to the fissure on either side. Sometimes\r\npowell-canyons-141.jpg\r\n\r\nA LATERAL CANYON.\r\n\r\n214 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nit is an interesting question to us whether the slope is not so steep\r\nthat we cannot stand on it. Sometimes, starting down, we are compelled\r\nto go on, and when we measure the crevice with our eye from above we are\r\nnot always sure that it is not too wide for a jump. Probably the slopes\r\nwould not be difficult if there was not a fissure at the lower end; nor\r\nwould the fissures cause fear if they were but a few feet deep. It is\r\ncurious how a little obstacle becomes a great obstruction when a misstep\r\nwould land a man in the bottom of a deep chasm. Climbing the face of a\r\ncliff, a man will without hesitancy walk along a step or shelf but a few\r\ninches wide if the landing is but ten feet below, but if the foot of the\r\ncliff is a thousand feet down he will prefer to crawl along the shelf.\r\nAt last our way is cut off by a fissure so deep and wide that we cannot\r\npass it. Then we turn and walk back into the country, over the smooth,\r\nnaked sandstone, without vegetation, except that here and there dwarf\r\ncedars and piñón pines have found a footing in the huge cracks. There\r\nare great basins in the rock, holding water,--some but a few gallons,\r\nothers hundreds of barrels.\r\n\r\nThe day is spent in walking about through these strange scenes. A narrow\r\ngulch is cut into the wall of the main canyon. Follow this up and the\r\nclimb is rapid, as if going up a mountain side, for the gulch heads but\r\na few hundred or a few thousand yards from the wall. But this gulch has\r\nits side gulches, and as the summit is approached a group of radiating\r\ncanyons is found. The spaces drained by these little canyons are\r\nterraced, and are, to a greater or less extent, of the form of\r\namphitheaters, though some are oblong and some rather irregular. Usually\r\nthe spaces drained by any two of these little side canyons are separated\r\nby a narrow wall, 100, 200, or 300 feet high, and often but a few feet\r\nin thickness. Sometimes the wall is broken into a line of pyramids above\r\nand still remains a wall below. There are a number of these gulches\r\nwhich break the wall of the main canyon of the Green, each one having\r\nits system of side canyons and amphitheaters, inclosed by walls or lines\r\nof pinnacles. The course of the Green at this point is approximately\r\nat right angles to that of the Colorado, and on the brink of the latter\r\ncanyon we find the same system of terraced and walled glens. The walls\r\nand pinnacles and towers are of sandstone, homogeneous in structure but\r\nnot in color, as they show broad bands of red,\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO. 215\r\n\r\nbuff, and gray. This painting of the rocks, dividing them into sections,\r\nincreases their apparent height. In some places these terraced and\r\nwalled glens along the Colorado have coalesced with those along the\r\nGreen; that is, the intervening walls are broken down. It is very rarely\r\nthat a loose rock is seen. The sand is washed off, so that the walls,\r\nterraces, and slopes of the glens are all of smooth sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn the walls themselves curious caves and channels have been carved.\r\nIn some places there are little stairways up the walls; in others, the\r\nwalls present what are known as royal arches; and so we wander through\r\nglens and among pinnacles and climb the walls from early morn until late\r\nin the afternoon.\r\n\r\nJuly 21.--We start this morning on the Colorado. The river is rough,\r\nand bad rapids in close succession are found. Two very hard portages are\r\nmade during the forenoon. After dinner, in running a rapid, the \"Emma\r\nDean\" is swamped and we are thrown into the river; we cling to the boat,\r\nand in the first quiet water below she is righted and bailed out; but\r\nthree oars are lost in this mishap. The larger boats land above\r\nthe dangerous place, and we make a portage, which occupies\r\npowell-canyons-142.jpg\r\n\r\nA TUSAYAN MEALING TROUGH.\r\n\r\nall the afternoon. We camp at night on the rocks on the left bank, and\r\ncan scarcely find room to lie down.\r\n\r\nJuly 22.--This morning we continue our journey, though short of\r\noars. There is no timber growing on the walls within our reach and no\r\ndriftwood along the banks, so we are compelled to go on until something\r\nsuitable can be found. A mile and three quarters below, we find\r\n\r\n216 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\na huge pile of driftwood, among which are some cottonwood logs. From\r\nthese we select one which we think the best, and the men are set at work\r\nsawing oars. Our boats are leaking again, from the strains received in\r\nthe bad rapids yesterday, so after dinner they are turned over and some\r\nof the men calk them.\r\n\r\nCaptain Powell and I go out to climb the wall to the east, for we can\r\nsee dwarf pines above, and it is our purpose to collect the resin which\r\noozes from them, to use in pitching our boats. We take a barometer with\r\nus and find that the walls are becoming higher, for now they register an\r\naltitude above the river of nearly 1,500 feet.\r\n\r\nJuly 23.--On starting, we come at once to difficult rapids and falls,\r\nthat in many places are more abrupt than in any of the canyons through\r\nwhich we have passed, and we decide to name this Cataract Canyon. From\r\nmorning until noon the course of the river is to the west; the scenery\r\nis grand, with rapids, and falls below, and walls above, beset with\r\ncrags and pinnacles. Just at noon we wheel again to the south and go\r\ninto camp for dinner.\r\n\r\nWhile the cook is preparing it, Bradley, Captain Powell, and I go up\r\ninto a side canyon that comes in at this point. We enter through a very\r\nnarrow passage, having to wade along the course of a little stream until\r\na cascade interrupts our progress. Then we climb to the right for a\r\nhundred feet until we reach a little shelf, along which we pass, walking\r\nwith great care, for it is narrow; thus we pass around the fall. Here\r\nthe gorge widens into a spacious, sky-roofed chamber. In the farther end\r\nis a beautiful grove of cottonwoods, and between us and the cotton-woods\r\nthe little stream widens out into three clear lakelets with bottoms of\r\nsmooth rock. Beyond the cottonwoods the brook tumbles in a series of\r\nwhite, shining cascades from heights that seem immeasurable. Turning\r\naround, we can look through the cleft through which we came and see the\r\nriver with towering walls beyond. What a chamber for a resting-place\r\nis this! hewn from the solid rock, the heavens for a ceiling, cascade\r\nfountains within, a grove in the conservatory, clear lakelets for a\r\nrefreshing bath, and an outlook through the doorway on a raging river,\r\nwith cliffs and mountains beyond.\r\n\r\nOur way after dinner is through a gorge, grand beyond description. The\r\nwalls are nearly vertical, the river broad and swift, but free from\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO. 217\r\n\r\nrocks and falls. From the edge of the water to the brink of the cliffs\r\nit is 1,600 to 1,800 feet. At this great depth the river rolls in solemn\r\nmajesty. The cliffs are reflected from the more quiet river, and we seem\r\nto be in the depths of the earth, and yet we can look down into waters\r\nthat reflect a bottomless abyss. Early in the afternoon we arrive\r\npowell-canyons-143.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE HEART OF CATARACT CANYON.\r\n\r\nat the head of more rapids and falls, but, wearied with past work, we\r\ndetermine to rest, so go into camp, and the afternoon and evening\r\nare spent by the men in discussing the probabilities of successfully\r\nnavigating the river below. The barometric records are examined to see\r\nwhat descent we have made since we left the mouth of the Grand, and what\r\ndescent since we left the Pacific Railroad, and what fall there yet\r\n\r\n218 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nmust be to the river ere we reach the end of the great canyons. The\r\nconclusion at which the men arrive seems to be about this: that there\r\nare great descents yet to be made, but if they are distributed in rapids\r\nand short falls, as they have been heretofore, we shall be able to\r\novercome them; but may be we shall come to a fall in these canyons which\r\nwe cannot pass, where the walls rise from the water's edge, so that we\r\ncannot land, and where the water is so swift that we cannot return. Such\r\nplaces have been found, except that the falls were not so great but that\r\nwe could run them with safety. How will it be in the future t So they\r\nspeculate over the serious probabilities in jesting mood.\r\n\r\nJuly 24.--We examine the rapids below. Large rocks have fallen from the\r\nwalls--great, angular blocks, which have rolled down the talus and are\r\nstrewn along the channel. We are compelled to make three portages in\r\nsuccession, the distance being less than three fourths of a mile, with\r\na fall of 75 feet. Among these rocks, in chutes, whirlpools, and great\r\nwaves, with rushing breakers and foam, the water finds its way, still\r\ntumbling down. We stop for the night only three fourths of a mile below\r\nthe last camp. A very hard day's work has been done, and at evening I\r\nsit on a rock by the edge of the river and look at the water and listen\r\nto its roar. Hours ago deep shadows settled into the canyon, as the sun\r\npassed behind the cliffs. Now, doubtless, the sun has gone down, for we\r\ncan see no glint of light on the crags above. Darkness is coming on; but\r\nthe waves are rolling with crests of foam so white they seem almost to\r\ngive a light of their own. Near by, a chute of water strikes the foot of\r\na great block of limestone 50 feet high, and the waters pile up against\r\nit and roll back. Where there are sunken rocks the water heaps up in\r\nmounds, or even in cones. At a point where rocks come very near the\r\nsurface, the water forms a chute above, strikes, and is shot up 10 or\r\n15 feet, and piles back in gentle curves, as in a fountain; and on the\r\nriver tumbles and rolls.\r\n\r\nJuly 25.--Still more rapids and falls to-day. In one, the \"Emma Dean\"\r\nis caught in a whirlpool and set spinning about, and it is with great\r\ndifficulty we are able to get out of it with only the loss of an oar. At\r\nnoon another is made; and on we go, running some of the rapids, letting\r\ndown with lines past others, and making two short portages. We camp on\r\nthe right bank, hungry and tired.\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO.\r\n\r\n219\r\n\r\nJuly 26.--We run a short distance this morning and go into camp to make\r\noars and repair boats and barometers. The walls of the canyon have been\r\nsteadily increasing in altitude to this point, and now they are more\r\nthan 2,000 feet high. In many places they are vertical from the water's\r\nedge; in others there is a talus between the river and the foot of the\r\ncliff; and they are often broken down by side canyons. It is probable\r\nthat the river is nearly as low now as it is ever found. High-water\r\nmark can be observed 40, 50, 60, or 100 feet above its present\r\nstage. Sometimes logs and driftwood are seen wedged into the crevices\r\nover-head, where floods have carried them.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock, Powell, Bradley, Howland, Hall, and I start\r\npowell-canyons-144.jpg\r\n\r\nWATER BASIN IN GYPSUM CANYON.\r\n\r\n220\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nup a side canyon to the east. We soon come to pools of water; then to\r\na brook, which is lost in the sands below; and passing up the brook,\r\nwe see that the canyon narrows, the walls close in and are often\r\noverhanging, and at last we find ourselves in a vast amphitheater, with\r\na pool of deep, clear, cold water on the bottom. At first our way seems\r\ncut off; but we soon discover a little shelf, along which we climb,\r\nand, passing beyond the pool, walk a hundred yards or more, turn to the\r\nright, and find ourselves in another dome-shaped amphitheater. There is\r\na winding cleft at the top, reaching out to the country above, nearly\r\n2,000 feet overhead. The rounded, basin-shaped bottom is filled with\r\nwater to the foot of the walls. There is no shelf by which we can pass\r\naround the foot. If we swim across we meet with a face of rock hundreds\r\nof feet high, over which a little rill glides, and it will be impossible\r\nto climb. So we can go no farther up this canyon. Then we turn back and\r\nexamine the walls on either side carefully, to discover, if possible,\r\nsome way of climbing out. In this search every man takes his own course,\r\nand we are scattered. I almost abandon the idea of getting out and\r\nam engaged in searching for fossils, when I discover, on the north,\r\na broken place lip which it may be possible to climb. The way for a\r\ndistance is up a slide of rocks; then up an irregular amphitheater,\r\non points that form steps and give handhold; and then I reach a little\r\nshelf, along which I walk, and discover a vertical fissure parallel to\r\nthe face of the wall and reaching to a higher shelf. This fissure\r\nis narrow and I try to climb up to the bench, which is about 40 feet\r\noverhead. I have a barometer on my back, which rather impedes my\r\nclimbing. The walls of the fissure are of smooth limestone, offering\r\nneither foothold nor handhold. So I support myself by pressing my back\r\nagainst one wall and my knees against the other, and in this way lift my\r\nbody, in a shuffling manner, a few inches at a time, until I have made\r\nperhaps 25 feet of the distance, when the crevice widens a little and I\r\ncannot press my knees against the rock in front with sufficient power to\r\ngive me support in lifting my body; so I try to go back. This I cannot\r\ndo without falling. So I struggle along sidewise farther into the\r\ncrevice, where it narrows. But by this time my muscles are exhausted,\r\nand I cannot climb longer; so I move still a little farther into the\r\ncrevice, where it is so narrow and wedging that I can lie in it, and\r\nthere\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO.\r\n\r\n221\r\n\r\nI rest. Five or ten minutes of this relief, and up once more I go, and\r\nreach the bench above. On this I can walk for a quarter of a mile, till\r\nI come to a place where the wall is again broken down, so I can climb up\r\nstill farther; and in an hour I reach the summit. I hang up my\r\nbarometer to give it a few minutes' time to settle, and occupy myself\r\nin collecting resin from the piñón pines, which are found in great\r\nabundance. One of the principal objects in making this climb was to get\r\nthis resin for the purpose of smearing our boats; but I have with me no\r\nmeans of carrying it down. The day is very hot and my coat was left in\r\ncamp, so I have no linings to tear out. Then it occurs to me to cut off\r\nthe sleeve of my shirt and tie it up at one end, and in this little\r\nsack I collect about a gallon of pitch. After taking observations for\r\naltitude, I wander back on the rock for an hour or two, when suddenly\r\nI notice that a storm is coming from the south. I seek a shelter in the\r\nrocks; but when the storm powell-canyons-145.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE WATER POCKET CANYON.\r\n\r\n222 powell-canyons-146.jpg\r\n\r\nPLAN OF THE RUIN OF KIN-TIEL, NEAR TUSAYAN.\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO. 223\r\n\r\nbursts, it comes down as a flood from the heavens,--not with gentle\r\ndrops at first, slowly increasing in quantity, but as if suddenly poured\r\nout. I am thoroughly drenched and almost washed away. It lasts not more\r\nthan half an hour, when the clouds sweep by to the north and I have\r\nsunshine again.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I have discovered a better way of getting down, and\r\nstart for camp, making the greatest haste possible. On reaching the\r\nbottom of the side canyon, I find a thousand streams rolling down the\r\ncliffs on every side, carrying with them red sand; and these all unite\r\nin the canyon below in one great stream of red mud.\r\n\r\nTraveling as fast as I can run, I soon reach the foot of the stream,\r\nfor the rain did not reach the lower end of the canyon and the water is\r\nrunning down a dry bed of sand; and although it conies in waves several\r\nfeet high and 15 or 20 feet in width, the sands soak it up and it is\r\nlost. But wave follows wave and rolls along and is swallowed up; and\r\nstill the floods come on from above. I find that I can travel faster\r\nthan the stream; so I hasten to camp and tell the men there is a river\r\ncoming down the canyon. We carry our camp equipage hastily from the bank\r\nto where we think it will be above the water. Then we stand by and see\r\nthe river roll on to join the Colorado. Great quantities of gypsum are\r\nfound at the bottom of the gorge; so we name it Gypsum Canyon.\r\n\r\nJuly 27.--We have more rapids and falls until noon; then we come to\r\na narrow place in the canyon, with vertical walls for several hundred\r\nfeet, above which are steep steps and sloping rocks back to the summits.\r\nThe river is very narrow, and we make our way with great care and much\r\nanxiety, hugging the wall on the left and carefully examining the way\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we pass to the left around a sharp point, which\r\nis somewhat broken down near the foot, and discover a flock of mountain\r\nsheep on the rocks more than a hundred feet above us. We land quickly\r\nin a cove out of sight, and away go all the hunters with their guns, for\r\nthe sheep have not discovered us. Soon we hear firing, and those of us\r\nwho have remained in the boats climb up to see what success the hunters\r\nhave had. One sheep has been killed, and two of the men are still\r\npursuing them. In a few minutes we hear firing again, and the next\r\nmoment down come the flock clattering over the rocks within 20\r\n\r\n224 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nyards of us. One of the hunters seizes his gun and brings a second sheep\r\ndown, and the next minute the remainder of the flock is lost behind the\r\nrocks. We all give chase; but it is impossible to follow their tracks\r\nover the naked rock, and we see them no more. Where they went out of\r\nthis rock-walled canyon is a mystery, for we can see no way of escape.\r\nDoubtless, if we could spare the time for the search, we should find a\r\ngulch up which they ran.\r\n\r\nWe lash our prizes to the deck of one of the boats and go on for a short\r\ndistance; but fresh meat is too tempting for us, and we stop early to\r\nhave a feast. And a feast it is! Two fine young sheep! We care not for\r\nbread or beans or dried apples to-night; coffee and mutton are all we\r\nask.\r\n\r\nJuly 28.--We make two portages this morning, one of them very long.\r\nDuring the afternoon we run a chute more than half a mile in length,\r\nnarrow and rapid. This chute has a floor of marble; the rocks dip in the\r\ndirection in which we are going, and the fall of the stream conforms to\r\nthe inclination of the beds; so we float on water that is gliding down\r\nan inclined plane. At the foot of the chute the river turns sharply to\r\nthe right and the water rolls up against a rock which from above seems\r\nto stand directly athwart its course. As we approach it we pull with all\r\nour power to the right, but it seems impossible to avoid being carried\r\nheadlong against the cliff; we are carried up high on the waves--but not\r\nagainst the rock, for the rebounding water strikes us and we are beaten\r\nback and pass on with safety, except that we get a good drenching.\r\n\r\n225\r\n\r\nAfter this the walls suddenly close in, so that the canyon is narrower\r\nthan we have ever known it. The water fills it from wall to wall, giving\r\nus no landing-place at the foot of the cliff; the river is very swift\r\nand the canyon very tortuous, so that we can see but a few hundred yards\r\nahead; the walls tower over us, often overhanging so as almost to shut\r\nout the light. I stand on deck, watching with intense anxiety, lest this\r\nmay lead us into some danger; but we glide along, with no obstruction,\r\nno falls, no rocks, and in a mile and a half emerge from the narrow\r\ngorge into a more open and broken portion of the canyon. Now that it is\r\npast, it seems a very simple thing indeed to run through such a place,\r\nbut the fear of what might be ahead made a deep impression on us.\r\n\r\n225 powell-canyons-147.jpg\r\n\r\nPESCADO HOUSES.\r\n\r\n226\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock we arrive at the foot of Cataract Canyon. Here a long\r\ncanyon valley comes down from the east, and the river turns sharply to\r\nthe west in a continuation of the line of the lateral valley. In the\r\nbend on the right vast numbers of crags and pinnacles and tower-shaped\r\nrocks are seen. We call it Mille Crag Bend.\r\n\r\nAnd now we wheel into another canyon, on swift water unobstructed by\r\nrocks. This new canyon is very narrow and very straight, with walls\r\nvertical below and terraced above. Where we enter it the brink of\r\npowell-canyons-148.jpg\r\n\r\nREPAIRING BOATS AT THE MOUTH OF DIRTY DEVIL RIVER.\r\n\r\nthe cliff is 1,300 feet above the water, but the rocks dip to the west,\r\nand as the course of the canyon is in that direction the walls are seen\r\nslowly to decrease in altitude. Floating down this narrow channel and\r\nlooking\r\n\r\nPROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO. 227\r\n\r\nout through the canyon crevice away in the distance, the river is seen\r\nto turn again to the left, and beyond this point, away many miles, a\r\ngreat mountain is seen. Still floating down, we see other mountains, now\r\non the right, now on the left, until a great mountain range is unfolded\r\nto view. We name this Narrow Canyon, and it terminates at the bend of\r\nthe river below.\r\n\r\nAs we go down to this point we discover the mouth of a stream which\r\nenters from the right. Into this our little boat is turned. The water is\r\nexceedingly muddy and has an unpleasant odor. One of the men in the boat\r\nfollowing, seeing what we have done, shouts to 'Dunn and asks whether\r\nit is a trout stream. Dunn replies, much disgusted, that it is \"a dirty\r\ndevil,\" and by this name the river is to be known hereafter.\r\n\r\nSome of us go out for half a mile and climb a butte to the north. The\r\ncourse of the Dirty Devil River can be traced for many miles. It comes\r\ndown through a very narrow canyon, and beyond it, to the southwest,\r\nthere is a long line of cliffs, with a broad terrace, or bench, between\r\nit and the brink of the canyon, and beyond these cliffs is situated the\r\nrange of mountains seen as we came down Narrow Canyon. Looking up the\r\nColorado, the chasm through which it runs can be seen, but we cannot see\r\ndown to its waters. The whole country is a region of naked rock of many\r\ncolors, with cliffs and buttes about us and towering mountains in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nJuly 29.--We enter a canyon to-day, with low, red walls. A short\r\ndistance below its head we discover the ruins of an old building on the\r\nleft wall. There is a narrow plain between the river and the wall just\r\nhere, and on the brink of a rock 200 feet high stands this old house.\r\nIts walls are of stone, laid in mortar with much regularity. It was\r\nprobably built three stories high; the lower story is yet almost intact;\r\nthe second is much broken down, and scarcely anything is left of the\r\nthird. Great quantities of flint chips are found on the rocks near\r\nby, and many arrowheads, some perfect, others broken; and fragments of\r\npottery are strewn about in great profusion. On the face of the cliff,\r\nunder the building and along down the river for 200 or 300 yards, there\r\nare many etchings. Two hours are given to the examination of these\r\ninteresting ruins; then we run down fifteen miles farther, and discover\r\nanother group. The principal building was situated on the summit of the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n228\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nA part of the walls are standing, to the height of eight or ten feet,\r\nand the mortar yet remains in some places. The house was in the shape of\r\nan L, with five rooms on the ground floor,--one in the angle and two in\r\neach extension. In the space in the angle there is a deep excavation.\r\nFrom what we know of the people in the Province of Tusayan, who are,\r\ndoubtless, of the same race as the former inhabitants of these ruins,\r\nwe conclude that this was a kiva, or underground chamber in which their\r\nreligious ceremonies were performed.\r\n\r\nWe leave these ruins and run down two or three miles and go into camp\r\nabout mid-afternoon. And now I climb the wall and go out into the back\r\ncountry for a walk.\r\n\r\nThe sandstone through which the canyon is cut is red and homogeneous,\r\nbeing the same as that through which Labyrinth Canyon runs. The smooth,\r\nnaked rock stretches out on either side of the river for many miles,\r\nbut curiously carved mounds and cones are scattered everywhere and deep\r\nholes are worn out. Many of these pockets are filled with water. In\r\none of these holes or wells, 20 feet deep, I find a tree growing. The\r\nexcavation is so narrow that I can step from its brink to a limb on the\r\ntree and descend to the bottom of the well down a growing ladder. Many\r\nof these pockets powell-canyons-149.jpg\r\n\r\nRUINS ON THE BRINK OF GLEN CANYON.\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO. 229\r\n\r\nare potholes, being found in the courses of little rills or brooks that\r\nrun during the rains which occasionally fall in this region; and often\r\na few harder rocks, which evidently assisted in their excavation, can be\r\nfound in their bottoms. Others, which are shallower, are not so easily\r\nexplained. Perhaps where they are found softer spots existed in the\r\nsandstone, places that yielded more readily to atmospheric degradation,\r\nthe loose sands being carried away by the winds.\r\n\r\nJust before sundown I attempt to climb a rounded eminence, from which I\r\nhope to obtain a good outlook on the surrounding country. It is formed\r\nof smooth mounds, piled one above another. Up these I climb, winding\r\nhere and there to find a practicable way, until near the summit they\r\nbecome too steep for me to proceed. I search about a few minutes for an\r\neasier way, when I am surprised at finding a stairway, evidently cut in\r\nthe rock by hands. At one place, where there is a vertical wall of 10\r\nor 12 feet, I find an old, rickety ladder. It may be that this was a\r\nwatchtower of that ancient people whose homes we have found in ruins.\r\nOn many of the tributaries of the Colorado, I have heretofore examined\r\ntheir deserted dwellings. Those that show evidences of being built\r\nduring the latter part of their occupation of the country are usually\r\nplaced on the most inaccessible cliffs. Sometimes the mouths of caves\r\nhave been walled across, and there are many other evidences to show\r\ntheir anxiety to secure defensible positions. Probably the nomadic\r\ntribes were sweeping down upon them and they resorted to these cliffs\r\nand canyons for safety. It is not unreasonable to suppose that this\r\norange mound was used as a watchtower. Here I stand, where these now\r\nlost people stood centuries ago, and look over this strange country,\r\ngazing off to great mountains in the northwest which are slowly\r\ndisappearing under cover of the night; and then I return to camp. It is\r\nno easy task to find my way down the wall in the darkness, and I clamber\r\nabout until it is nearly midnight when camp is reached.\r\n\r\nJuly 30.--We make good progress to-day, as the water, though smooth,\r\nis swift. Sometimes the canyon walls are vertical to the top; sometimes\r\nthey are vertical below and have a mound-covered slope above; in other\r\nplaces the slope, with its mounds, comes down to the water's edge.\r\n\r\nStill proceeding on our way, we find that the orange sandstone is cut in\r\ntwo by a group of firm, calcareous strata, and the lower bed is under-\r\n\r\n230 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nlaid by soft, gypsiferous shales. Sometimes the upper homogeneous bed\r\nis a smooth, vertical wall, but usually it is carved with mounds, with\r\ngently meandering valley lines. The lower bed, yielding to gravity, as\r\nthe softer shales below work, out into the river, breaks into angular\r\nsurfaces, often having a columnar appearance. One could almost imagine\r\nthat the walls had been carved with a purpose, to represent giant\r\narchitectural forms. In the deep recesses of the walls we find springs,\r\nwith mosses and ferns on the moistened sandstone.\r\n\r\nJuly 31.--We have a cool, pleasant ride to-day through this part of the\r\ncanyon. The walls are steadily increasing in altitude, the curves are\r\ngentle, and often the river sweeps by an arc of vertical wall, smooth\r\nand unbroken, and then by a curve that is variegated by royal arches,\r\nmossy alcoves, deep, beautiful glens, and painted grottoes. Soon\r\nafter dinner we discover the mouth of the San Juan, where we camp. The\r\nremainder of the afternoon is given to hunting some way by which we can\r\nclimb out of the canyon; but it ends in failure.\r\n\r\nAugust 1.--We drop down two miles this morning and go into camp again.\r\nThere is a low, willow-covered strip of land along the walls on the\r\neast. Across this we walk, to explore an alcove which we see from the\r\nriver. On entering, we find a little grove of box-elder and cotton-wood\r\ntrees, and turning to the right, we find ourselves in a vast chamber,\r\ncarved out of the rock. At the upper end there is a clear, deep pool of\r\nwater, bordered with verdure. Standing by the side of this, we can see\r\nthe grove at the entrance. The chamber is more than 200 feet high, 500\r\nfeet long, and 200 feet wide. Through the ceiling, and on through the\r\nrocks for a thousand feet above, there is a narrow, winding skylight;\r\nand this is all carved out by a little stream which runs only during the\r\nfew showers that fall now and then in this arid country. The waters\r\nfrom the bare rocks back of the canyon, gathering rapidly into a small\r\nchannel, have eroded a deep side canyon, through which they run until\r\nthey fall into the farther end of this chamber. The rock at the ceiling\r\nis hard, the rock below, very soft and friable; and having cut through\r\nthe upper and harder portion down into the lower and softer, the stream\r\nhas washed out these friable sandstones; and thus the chamber has been\r\nexcavated.\r\n\r\nHere we bring our camp. When \"Old Shady\" sings us a song at\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO.\r\n\r\n231\r\n\r\nnight, we are pleased to find that this hollow in the rock is filled\r\nwith sweet sounds. It was doubtless made for an academy of music by its\r\nstorm-born architect; so we name it Music Temple.\r\n\r\nAugust 2.--We still keep our camp in Music Temple to-day. I wish to\r\nobtain a view of the adjacent country, if possible; so, early in the\r\nmorning the men take me across the river, and I pass along by the foot\r\nof the cliff half a mile up stream and then climb, first up broken\r\nledges, then 200 or 300 yards up a smooth, sloping rock, and then pass\r\nout on a narrow ridge. Still, I find I have not attained an altitude\r\nfrom which I can overlook the region outside of the canyon; and so I\r\ndescend into a little gulch and climb again to a higher ridge, all the\r\nway along naked sandstone, and at last I reach a point of commanding\r\nview. I can look several miles up the San Juan, and a long distance up\r\nthe Colorado; and away to the northwest I can see the Henry Mountains;\r\nto the northeast, the Sierra La Sal; to the southeast, unknown\r\nmountains; and to the southwest, the meandering of the canyon. Then I\r\nreturn to the bank of the river. We sleep again in Music Temple.\r\n\r\nAugust 3.--Start early this morning. The features of this canyon are\r\ngreatly diversified. Still vertical walls at times. These are usually\r\nfound to stand above great curves. The river, sweeping around these\r\npowell-canyons-150.jpg\r\n\r\nISLAND MONUMENT IN GLEN CANYON.\r\n\r\n232\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nbends, undermines the cliffs in places. Sometimes the rocks are\r\noverhanging; in other curves, curious, narrow glens are found. Through\r\nthese we climb, by a rough stairway, perhaps several hundred feet, to\r\nwhere a spring bursts out from under an overhanging cliff, and where\r\ncottonwoods and willows stand, while along the curves of the brooklet\r\noaks grow, and other rich vegetation is seen, in marked contrast to the\r\ngeneral appearance of naked rock. We call these Oak Glens.\r\n\r\nOther wonderful features are the many side canyons or gorges that we\r\npass. Sometimes we stop to explore these for a short distance. In some\r\nplaces their walls are much nearer each other above than below, so that\r\nthey look somewhat like caves or chambers in the rocks. Usually, in\r\ngoing up such a gorge, we find beautiful vegetation; but our way is\r\noften cut off by deep basins, or \"potholes,\" as they are called.\r\n\r\nOn the walls, and back many miles into the country, numbers of\r\nmonument-shaped buttes are observed. So we have a curious ensemble of\r\nwonderful features--carved walls, royal arches, glens, alcove gulches,\r\npowell-canyons-151.jpg\r\n\r\nGLEN CANYON.\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO. 233\r\n\r\nmounds, and monuments. From which of these features shall we select a\r\nname? We decide to call it Glen Canyon.\r\n\r\nPast these towering monuments, past these mounded billows of orange\r\nsandstone, past these oak-set glens, past these fern-decked alcoves,\r\npast these mural curves, we glide hour after hour, stopping now and\r\nthen, as our attention is arrested by some new wonder, until we reach a\r\npoint which is historic.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1776, Father Escalante, a Spanish priest, made an expedition\r\nfrom Santa Fe to the northwest, crossing the Grand and Green, and then\r\npassing down along the Wasatch Mountains and the southern plateaus until\r\nhe reached the Rio Virgen. His intention was to cross to the Mission of\r\nMonterey; but, from information received from the Indians, he decided\r\nthat the route was impracticable. Not wishing to return to Santa Fe over\r\nthe circuitous route by which he had just traveled, he attempted to go\r\nby one more direct, which led him across the Colorado at a point known\r\nas El Vado de los Padres. From the description which we have read, we\r\nare enabled to determine the place. A little stream comes down through\r\na very narrow side canyon from the west. It was down this that he\r\ncame, and our boats are lying at the point where the ford crosses. A\r\nwell-beaten Indian trail is seen here yet. Between the cliff and the\r\nriver there is a little meadow. The ashes of many camp fires are seen,\r\nand the bones of numbers of cattle are bleaching on the grass. For\r\nseveral years the Navajos have raided on the Mormons that dwell in the\r\nvalleys to the west, and they doubtless cross frequently at this ford\r\nwith their stolen cattle.\r\n\r\nAugust 4.--To-day the walls grow higher and the canyon much narrower.\r\nMonuments are still seen on either side; beautiful glens and alcoves and\r\ngorges and side canyons are yet found. After dinner we find the river\r\nmaking a sudden turn to the northwest and the whole character of the\r\ncanyon changed. The walls are many hundreds of feet higher, and the\r\nrocks are chiefly variegated shales of beautiful colors--creamy orange\r\nabove, then bright vermilion, and below, purple and chocolate beds, with\r\ngreen and yellow sands. We run four miles through this, in a direction\r\na little to the west of north, wheel again to the west, and pass into\r\na portion of the canyon where the characteristics are more like those\r\nabove the bend. At night we stop at the mouth of\r\n\r\n234\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\na creek coming in from the right, and suppose it to be the Paria, which\r\nwas described to me last year by a Mormon missionary. Here the canyon\r\nterminates abruptly in a line of cliffs, which stretches from either\r\nside across the river.\r\n\r\nAugust 5.--With some feeling of anxiety we enter a new canyon this\r\nmorning. We have learned to observe closely the texture of the rock. In\r\nsofter strata we have a quiet river, in harder we find rapids and\r\nfalls. Below us are the limestones and hard sandstones which we found in\r\nCataract Canyon. This bodes toil and danger. Besides the texture of the\r\nrocks, there is another condition which affects the character of the\r\nchannel, as we have found by experience. Where the strata are horizontal\r\nthe river is often quiet, and, even though it may be very swift in\r\nplaces, no great obstacles are found. Where the rocks incline in the\r\ndirection traveled, the river usually sweeps with great velocity, but\r\nstill has few rapids and falls. But where the rocks dip up stream and\r\nthe river cuts obliquely across the upturned formations, harder strata\r\nabove and softer below, we have rapids and falls. Into hard rocks and\r\ninto rocks dipping up stream we pass this morning and start on a long,\r\nrocky, mad rapid. On the left there is a vertical rock, and down by this\r\ncliff and around to the left we glide, tossed just enough by the waves\r\nto appreciate the rate at which we are traveling.\r\n\r\n235\r\n\r\nThe canyon is narrow, with vertical walls, which gradually grow higher.\r\nMore rapids and falls are found. We come to one with a drop of sixteen\r\nfeet, around which we make a portage, and then stop for dinner. Then a\r\nrun of two miles, and another portage, long and difficult; then we camp\r\nfor the night on a bank of sand.\r\n\r\nAugust 6.--Canyon walls, still higher and higher, as we go down through\r\nstrata. There is a steep talus at the foot of the cliff, and in some\r\nplaces the upper parts of the walls are terraced.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock we come to a place where the river occupies the entire\r\nchannel and the walls are vertical from the water's edge. We see a fall\r\nbelow and row up against the cliff. There is a little shelf, or rather\r\na horizontal crevice, a few feet over our heads. One man stands on the\r\ndeck of the boat, another climbs on his shoulders, and then into the\r\ncrevice. Then we pass him a line, and two or three others, with myself,\r\nfollow; then we pass along the crevice until it becomes a shelf, as\r\n\r\n235 powell-canyons-152.jpg\r\n\r\nAN ENCLOSING WALL OF UPRIGHT STONES AT OJO CALIENTE.\r\n\r\n236\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthe upper part, or roof, is broken off. On this we walk for a short\r\ndistance, slowly climbing all the way, until we reach a point where the\r\nshelf is broken off, and we can pass no farther. So we go back to the\r\nboat, cross the stream, and get some logs that have lodged in the rocks,\r\nbring them to our side, pass them along the crevice and shelf, and\r\nbridge over the broken place. Then we go on to a point over the falls,\r\nbut do not obtain a satisfactory view. So we climb out to the top of the\r\nwall and walk along to find a point below the fall from which it can be\r\nseen. From this point it seems possible to let down our boats with lines\r\nto the head of the rapids, and then make a portage; so we return, row\r\ndown by the side of the cliff as far as we dare, and fasten one of the\r\nboats to a rock. Then we let down another boat to the end of its line\r\nbeyond the first, and the third boat to the end of its line below the\r\nsecond, which brings it to the head of the fall and under an overhanging\r\nrock. Then the upper boat, in obedience to a signal, lets go; we pull in\r\nthe line and catch the nearest boat as it comes, and then the last. The\r\nportage follows.\r\n\r\nWe go into camp early this afternoon at a place where it seems possible\r\nto climb out, and the evening is spent in \"making observations for\r\ntime.\" powell-canyons-153.jpg\r\n\r\nMARBLE CANYON.\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO. 237\r\n\r\nAugust 7.--The almanac tells us that we are to have an eclipse of\r\nthe sun to-day; so Captain Powell and myself start early, taking our\r\ninstruments with us for the purpose of making observations on the\r\neclipse to determine our longitude. Arriving at the summit, after four\r\nhours' hard climbing to attain 2,300 feet in height, we hurriedly build\r\na platform of rocks on which to place our instruments, and quietly wait\r\nfor the eclipse; but clouds come on and rain falls, and sun and moon are\r\nobscured.\r\n\r\nMuch disappointed, we start on our return to camp, but it is late and\r\nthe clouds make the night very dark. We feel our way down among the\r\nrocks with great care for two or three hours, making slow progress\r\nindeed. At last we lose our way and dare proceed no farther. The rain\r\ncomes down in torrents and we can find no shelter. We can neither climb\r\nup nor go down, and in the darkness dare not move about; so we sit and\r\n\"weather out\" the night.\r\n\r\nAugust 8.--Daylight comes after a long, oh, how long! a night, and we\r\nsoon reach camp. After breakfast we start again, and make two portages\r\nduring the forenoon.\r\n\r\nThe limestone of this canyon is often polished, and makes a beautiful\r\nmarble. Sometimes the rocks are of many colors--white, gray, pink, and\r\npurple, with saffron tints. It is with very great labor that we make\r\nprogress, meeting with many obstructions, running rapids, letting down\r\nour boats with lines from rock to rock, and sometimes carrying boats and\r\ncargoes around bad places. We camp at night, just after a hard portage,\r\nunder an overhanging wall, glad to find shelter from the rain. We\r\nhave to search for some time to find a few sticks of driftwood, just\r\nsufficient to boil a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nThe water sweeps rapidly in this elbow of river, and has cut its way\r\nunder the rock, excavating a vast half-circular chamber, which, if\r\nutilized for a theater, would give sitting to 50,000 people. Objection\r\nmight be raised against it, however, for at high water the floor is\r\ncovered with a raging flood.\r\n\r\nAugust 9.--And now the scenery is on a grand scale. The walls of the\r\ncanyon, 2,500 feet high, are of marble, of many beautiful colors, often\r\npolished below by the waves, and sometimes far up the sides, where\r\nshowers have washed the sands over the cliffs. At one place I\r\n\r\n238 8 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nhave a walk for more than a mile on a marble pavement, all polished\r\nand fretted with strange devices and embossed in a thousand fantastic\r\npatterns. Through a cleft in the wall the sun shines on this pavement\r\nand it gleams in iridescent beauty.\r\n\r\nI pass up into the cleft. It is very narrow, with a succession of pools\r\nstanding at higher levels as I go back. The water in these pools is\r\nclear and cool, coming down from springs. Then I return to the pavement,\r\nwhich is but a terrace or bench, over which the river runs at its flood,\r\nbut left bare at present. Along the pavement in many places are basins\r\nof clear water, in strange contrast to the red mud of the river. At\r\nlength I come to the end of this marble terrace and take again to the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nRiding down a short distance, a beautiful view is presented. The river\r\nturns sharply to the east and seems inclosed by a wall set with a\r\nmillion brilliant gems. What can it mean? Every eye is engaged, every\r\none wonders. On coming nearer we find fountains bursting from the rock\r\nhigh overhead, and the spray in the sunshine forms the gems which bedeck\r\nthe wall. The rocks below the fountain are covered with mosses and ferns\r\nand many beautiful flowering plants. We name it Vasey's Paradise, in\r\nhonor of the botanist who traveled with us last year.\r\n\r\nWe pass many side canyons to-day that are dark, gloomy passages back\r\ninto the heart of the rocks that form the plateau through which this\r\ncanyon is cut. It rains again this afternoon. Scarcely do the first\r\ndrops fall when little rills run down the walls. As the storm comes\r\non, the little rills increase in size, until great streams are formed.\r\nAlthough the walls of the canyon are chiefly limestone, the adjacent\r\ncountry is of red sandstone; and now the waters, loaded with these\r\nsands, come down in rivers of bright red mud, leaping over the walls in\r\ninnumerable cascades. It is plain now how these walls are polished in\r\nmany places.\r\n\r\nAt last the storm ceases and we go on. We have cut through the\r\nsandstones and limestones met in the upper part of the canyon, and\r\nthrough one great bed of marble a thousand feet in thickness. In this,\r\ngreat numbers of caves are hollowed out, and carvings are seen which\r\nsuggest architectural forms, though on a scale so grand that architec-\r\n\r\n239 powell-canyons-154.jpg\r\n\r\nNOONDAY REST IN MARBLE CANYON.\r\n\r\n240 powell-canyons-155.jpg\r\n\r\nVIEW OF MARBLE CANYON FROM VERMILION CLIFFS.\r\n\r\nFROM THE GRAND TO THE LITTLE COLORADO. 241\r\n\r\ntural terms belittle them. As this great bed forms a distinctive feature\r\nof the canyon, we call it Marble Canyon.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar feature of these walls that many projections are set\r\nout into the river, as if the wall was buttressed for support. The\r\nwalls themselves are half a mile high, and these buttresses are on\r\na corresponding scale, jutting into the river scores of feet. In the\r\nrecesses between these projections there are quiet bays, except at the\r\nfoot of a rapid, when there are dancing eddies or whirlpools. Sometimes\r\nthese alcoves have caves at the back, giving them the appearance of\r\ngreat depth. Then other caves are seen above, forming vast dome-shaped\r\nchambers. The walls and buttresses and chambers are all of marble.\r\n\r\nThe river is now quiet; the canyon wider. Above, when the river is at\r\nits flood, the waters gorge up, so that the difference between high and\r\nlow water mark is often 50 or even 70 feet, but here high-water mark is\r\nnot more than 20 feet above the present stage of the river. Sometimes\r\nthere is a narrow flood plain between the water and the wall. Here we\r\nfirst discover mesquite shrubs,--small trees with finely divided leaves\r\nand pods, somewhat like the locust.\r\n\r\nAugust 10.--Walls still higher; water swift again. We pass several\r\nbroad, ragged canyons on our right, and up through these we catch\r\nglimpses of a forest-clad plateau, miles away to the west.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock we reach the mouth of the Colorado Chiquito. This\r\nstream enters through a canyon on a scale quite as grand as that of\r\nthe Colorado itself. It is a very small river and exceedingly muddy\r\nand saline. I walk up the stream three or four miles this afternoon,\r\ncrossing and recrossing where I can easily wade it. Then I climb several\r\nhundred feet at one place, and can see for several miles up the chasm\r\nthrough which the river runs. On my way back I kill two rattlesnakes,\r\nand find on my arrival that another has been killed just at camp.\r\n\r\nAugust 11.--We remain at this point to-day for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the latitude and longitude, measuring the height of the\r\nwalls, drying our rations, and repairing our boats.\r\n\r\nCaptain Powell early in the morning takes a barometer and goes out to\r\nclimb a point between the two rivers. I walk down the gorge to the left\r\nat the foot of the cliff, climb to a bench, and discover a trail, deeply\r\nworn in the rock. Where it crosses the side gulches in some\r\n\r\n242 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nplaces steps have been cut. I can see no evidence of its having been\r\ntraveled for a long time. It was doubtless a path used by the people who\r\ninhabited this country anterior to the present Indian races--the people\r\nwho built the communal houses of which mention has been made.\r\n\r\nI return to camp about three o'clock and find that some of the men\r\nhave discovered ruins and many fragments of pottery; also etchings and\r\nhieroglyphics on the rocks.\r\n\r\nWe find to-night, on comparing the readings of the barometers, that\r\nthe walls are about 3,000 feet high--more than half a mile--an altitude\r\ndifficult to appreciate from a mere statement of feet. The slope by\r\nwhich the ascent is made is not such a slope as is usually found in\r\nclimbing a mountain, but one much more abrupt--often vertical for many\r\nhundreds of feet,--so that the impression is given that we are at great\r\ndepths, and we look up to see but a little patch of sky.\r\n\r\nBetween the two streams, above the Colorado Chiquito, in some places\r\nthe rocks are broken and shelving for 600 Or 700 feet; then there is\r\na sloping terrace, which can be climbed only by finding some way up a\r\ngulch; then another terrace, and back, still another cliff. The summit\r\nof the cliff is 3,000 feet above the river, as our barometers attest.\r\n\r\nOur camp is below the Colorado Chiquito and on the eastern side of the\r\ncanyon.\r\n\r\nAugust 12.--The rocks above camp are rust-colored sandstones and\r\nconglomerates. Some are very hard; others quite soft. They all lie\r\nnearly horizontal, and the beds of softer material have been washed out,\r\nleaving the harder forming a series of shelves. Long lines of these are\r\nseen, of varying thickness, from one or two to twenty or thirty feet,\r\nand the spaces between have the same variability. This morning I spend\r\ntwo or three hours in climbing among these shelves, and then I pass\r\nabove them and go up a long slope to the foot of the cliff and try to\r\ndiscover some way by which I can reach the top of the wall; but I find\r\nmy progress cut off by an amphitheater. Then I wander away around to the\r\nleft, up a little gulch and along benches, climbing from time to time,\r\nuntil I reach an altitude of nearly 2,000 feet and can get no higher.\r\nFrom this point I can look off to the west, up side canyons of the\r\nColorado, and see the edge of a great plateau, from which streams run\r\ndown into the Colorado, and deep gulches in the\r\n\r\n243 powell-canyons-156.jpg\r\n\r\nADOBE WALLS, ZUÑI\r\n\r\n244 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nescarpment which faces us, continued by canyons, ragged and flaring and\r\nset with cliffs and towering crags, down to the river. I can see far up\r\nMarble Canyon to long lines of chocolate-colored cliffs, and above these\r\nthe Vermilion Cliffs. I can see, also, up the Colorado Chiquito, through\r\na very ragged and broken canyon, with sharp salients set out from the\r\nwalls on either side, their points overlapping, so that a huge tooth of\r\nmarble on one side seems to be set between two teeth on the opposite;\r\nand I can also get glimpses of walls standing away back from the river,\r\nwhile over my head are mural escarpments not possible to be scaled.\r\n\r\nCataract Canyon is 41 miles long. The walls are 1,300 feet high at its\r\nhead, and they gradually increase in altitude to a point about halfway\r\ndown, where they are 2,700 feet, and then decrease to 1,300 feet at the\r\nfoot. Narrow Canyon is 9 1/2 miles long, with walls 1,300 feet in height\r\nat the head and coming down to the water at the foot.\r\n\r\nThere is very little vegetation in this canyon or in the adjacent\r\ncountry. Just at the junction of the Grand and Green there are a number\r\nof hackberry trees; and along the entire length of Cataract Canyon the\r\nhigh-water line is marked by scattered trees of the same species. A few\r\nnut pines and cedars are found, and occasionally a redbud or Judas tree;\r\nbut the general aspect of the canyons and of the adjacent country is\r\nthat of naked rock.\r\n\r\n244\r\n\r\nThe distance through Glen Canyon is 149 miles. Its walls vary in height\r\nfrom 200 or 300 to 1,600 feet. Marble Canyon is 65 1/2 miles long. At\r\nits head it is 200 feet deep, and it steadily increases in depth to its\r\nfoot, where its walls are 3,500 feet high.\r\n\r\n245 powell-canyons-157.jpg\r\n\r\n246 powell-canyons-158.jpg\r\n\r\nAT THE MOUTH OF THE LITTLE COLORADO.\r\n\r\n247\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFROM THE LITTLE COLORADO TO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 13.--We are now ready to start on our way down the Great Unknown.\r\nOur boats, tied to a common, stake, chafe each other as they are tossed\r\nby the fretful river. They ride high and buoyant, for their loads are\r\nlighter than we could desire. We have but a month's rations remaining.\r\nThe flour has been resifted through the mosquito-net sieve; the spoiled\r\nbacon has been dried and the worst of it boiled; the few pounds of dried\r\napples have been spread in the sun and reshrunken to their normal bulk.\r\nThe sugar has all melted and gone on its way down the river. But we have\r\na large sack of coffee. The lightening of the boats has this advantage:\r\nthey will ride the waves better and we shall have but little to carry\r\nwhen we make a portage.\r\n\r\nWe are three quarters of a mile in the depths of the earth, and the\r\ngreat river shrinks into insignificance as it dashes its angry waves\r\nagainst the walls and cliffs that rise to the world above; the waves are\r\nbut puny ripples, and we but pigmies, running up and down the sands or\r\nlost among the boulders.\r\n\r\nWe have an unknown distance yet to run, an unknown river to explore.\r\nWhat falls there are, we know not; what rocks beset the channel, we\r\nknow not; what walls rise over the river, we know not. Ah, well! we may\r\nconjecture many things. The men talk as cheerfully as ever; jests are\r\nbandied about freely this morning; but to me the cheer is somber and the\r\njests are ghastly.\r\n\r\nWith some eagerness and some anxiety and some misgiving we enter the\r\ncanyon below and are carried along by the swift water through walls\r\nwhich rise from its very edge. They have the same structure that we\r\nnoticed yesterday--tiers of irregular shelves below, and, above these,\r\n\r\n248 8 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nsteep slopes to the foot of marble cliffs. We run six miles in a little\r\nmore than half an hour and emerge into a more open portion of the\r\ncanyon, where high hills and ledges of rock intervene between the river\r\nand the distant walls. Just at the head of this open place the river\r\nruns across a dike; that is, a fissure in the rocks, open to depths\r\nbelow, was filled with eruptive matter, and this on cooling was harder\r\nthan the rocks through which the crevice was made, and when these were\r\nwashed away the harder volcanic matter remained as a wall, and the river\r\nhas cut a gateway through it several hundred feet high and as many wide.\r\nAs it crosses the wall, there is a fall below and a bad rapid, filled\r\nwith boulders of trap; so we stop to make a portage. Then on we go,\r\ngliding by hills and ledges, with distant walls in view; sweeping past\r\nsharp angles of rock; stopping at a few points to examine rapids, which\r\nwe find can be run, until we have made another five miles, when we land\r\nfor dinner.\r\n\r\nThen we let down with lines over a long rapid and start again. Once more\r\nthe walls close in, and we find ourselves in a narrow gorge, the water\r\nagain filling the channel and being very swift. With great care\r\nand constant watchfulness we proceed, making about four miles this\r\nafternoon, and camp in a cave.\r\n\r\nAugust 14---At daybreak we walk down the bank of the river, on a little\r\nsandy beach, to take a view of a new feature in the canyon. Heretofore\r\nhard rocks have given us bad river; soft rocks, smooth water; and a\r\nseries of rocks harder than any we have experienced sets in. The river\r\nenters the gneiss! We can see but a little way into the granite gorge,\r\nbut it looks threatening.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we enter on the waves. At the very introduction it\r\ninspires awe. The canyon is narrower than we have ever before seen it;\r\nthe water is swifter; there are but few broken rocks in the channel; but\r\nthe walls are set, on either side, with pinnacles and crags; and sharp,\r\nangular buttresses, bristling with wind- and wave-polished spires,\r\nextend far out into the river.\r\n\r\nLedges of rock jut into the stream, their tops sometimes just below the\r\nsurface, sometimes rising a few or many feet above; and island ledges\r\nand island pinnacles and island towers break the swift course of the\r\nstream into chutes and eddies and whirlpools. We soon reach a place\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\n249\r\n\r\nwhere a creek comes in from the left, and, just below, the channel is\r\nchoked with boulders, which have washed down this lateral canyon and\r\nformed a dam, over which there is a fall of 30 or 40 feet; but on the\r\nboulders foothold can be had, and we make a portage. Three more such\r\ndams are found. Over one we make a portage; at the other two are chutes\r\nthrough which we can run.\r\n\r\nAs we proceed the granite rises higher, until nearly a thousand feet\r\nof the lower part of the walls are composed of this rock.\r\npowell-canyons-159.jpg\r\n\r\nWALLS OF GNEISS.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o'clock we hear a great roar ahead, and approach it very\r\ncautiously. The sound grows louder and louder as we run, and at last we\r\nfind ourselves above a long, broken fall, with ledges and pinnacles of\r\n\r\n250\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nrock obstructing the river. There is a descent of perhaps 75 or 80 feet\r\nin a third of a mile, and the rushing waters break into great waves\r\npowell-canyons-160.jpg\r\n\r\nRUNNING A RAPID.\r\n\r\non the rocks, and lash themselves into a mad, white foam. We can land\r\njust above, but there is no foothold on either side by which we can make\r\na portage. It is nearly a thousand feet to the top of the granite;\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON. 251\r\n\r\nso it will be impossible to carry our boats around, though we can climb\r\nto the summit up a side gulch and, passing along a mile or two, descend\r\nto the river. This we find on examination; but such a portage would be\r\nimpracticable for us, and we must run the rapid or abandon the river.\r\nThere is no hesitation. We step into our boats, push off, and away we\r\ngo, first on smooth but swift water, then we strike a glassy wave and\r\nride to its top, down again into the trough, up again on a higher wave,\r\nand down and up on waves higher and still higher until we strike one\r\njust as it curls back, and a breaker rolls over our little boat. Still\r\non we speed, shooting past projecting rocks, till the little boat is\r\ncaught in a whirlpool and spun round several times. At last we pull out\r\nagain into the stream. And now the other boats have passed us. The open\r\ncompartment of the \"Emma Dean\" is filled with water and every breaker\r\nrolls over us. Hurled back from a rock, now on this side, now on that,\r\nwe are carried into an eddy, in which we struggle for a few minutes,\r\nand are then out again, the breakers still rolling over us. Our boat\r\nis unmanageable, but she cannot sink, and we drift down another hundred\r\nyards through breakers--how, we scarcely know. We find the other boats\r\nhave turned into an eddy at the foot of the fall and are waiting to\r\ncatch us as we come, for the men have seen that our boat is swamped.\r\nThey push out as we come near and pull us in against the wall. Our boat\r\nbailed, on we go again.\r\n\r\nThe walls now are more than a mile in height--a vertical distance\r\ndifficult to appreciate. Stand on the south steps of the Treasury\r\nbuilding in Washington and look down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol;\r\nmeasure this distance overhead, and imagine cliffs to extend to that\r\naltitude, and you will understand what is meant; or stand at Canal\r\nStreet in New York and look up Broadway to Grace Church, and you have\r\nabout the distance; or stand at Lake Street bridge in Chicago and look\r\ndown to the Central Depot, and you have it again.\r\n\r\nA thousand feet of this is up through granite crags; then steep slopes\r\nand perpendicular cliffs rise one above another to the summit. The gorge\r\nis black and narrow below, red and gray and flaring above, with crags\r\nand angular projections on the walls, which, cut in many places by side\r\ncanyons, seem to be a vast wilderness of rocks. Down in these grand,\r\ngloomy depths we glide, ever listening, for the mad waters keep\r\n\r\n252 powell-canyons-161.jpg\r\n\r\nHEAD OF THE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON. 253\r\n\r\nup their roar; ever watching, ever peering ahead, for the narrow canyon\r\nis winding and the river is closed in so that we can see but a few\r\nhundred yards, and what there may be below we know not; so we listen for\r\nfalls and watch for rocks, stopping now and then in the bay of a recess\r\nto admire the gigantic scenery; and ever as we go there is some new\r\npinnacle or tower, some crag or peak, some distant view of the upper\r\nplateau, some strangely shaped rock, or some deep, narrow side canyon.\r\n\r\nThen we come to another broken fall, which appears more difficult than\r\nthe one we ran this morning. A small creek comes in on the right, and\r\nthe first fall of the water is over boulders, which have been carried\r\ndown by this lateral stream. We land at its mouth and stop for an hour\r\nor two to examine the fall. It seems possible to let down with lines, at\r\nleast a part of the way, from point to point, along the right-hand\r\nwall. So we make a portage over the first rocks and find footing on\r\nsome boulders below. Then we let down one of the boats to the end of her\r\nline, when she reaches a corner of the projecting rock, to which one of\r\nthe men clings and steadies her while I examine an eddy below. I think\r\nwe can pass the other boats down by us and catch them in the eddy. This\r\nis soon done, and the men in the boats in the eddy pull us to their\r\nside. On the shore of this little eddy there is about two feet of gravel\r\nbeach above the water. Standing on this beach, some of the men take the\r\nline of the little boat and let it drift down against another projecting\r\nangle. Here is a little shelf, on which a man from my boat climbs, and\r\na shorter line is passed to him, and he fastens the boat to the side\r\nof the cliff; then the second one is let down, bringing the line of\r\nthe third. When the second boat is tied up, the two men standing on the\r\nbeach above spring into the last boat, which is pulled up alongside of\r\nours; then we let down the boats for 25 or 30 yards by walking along the\r\nshelf, landing them again in the mouth of a side canyon. Just below this\r\nthere is another pile of boulders, over which we make another portage.\r\nFrom the foot of these rocks we can climb to another shelf, 40 or 50\r\nfeet above the water.\r\n\r\nOn this bench we camp for the night. It is raining hard, and we have\r\nno shelter, but find a few sticks which have lodged in the rocks, and\r\nkindle a fire and have supper. We sit on the rocks all night, wrapped in\r\nour ponchos, getting what sleep we can.\r\n\r\n254 powell-canyons-162.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE INNER GORGE.\r\n\r\n255\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\nAugust 15.--This morning we find we can let down for 300 or 400 yards,\r\nand it is managed in this way: we pass along the wall by climbing from\r\nprojecting point to point, sometimes near the water's edge, at other\r\nplaces 50 or 60 feet above, and hold the boat with a line while two men\r\nremain aboard and prevent her from being dashed against the rocks and\r\nkeep the line from getting caught on the wall. In two hours we have\r\nbrought them all down, as far as it is possible, in this way. A few\r\nyards below, the river strikes with great violence against a projecting\r\nrock and our boats are pulled up in a little bay above. We must now\r\nmanage to pull out of this and clear the point below. The little boat is\r\nheld by the bow obliquely up the stream. We jump in and pull out only\r\na few strokes, and sweep clear of the dangerous rock. The other boats\r\nfollow in the same manner and the rapid is passed.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to describe the labor of such navigation. We must prevent\r\nthe waves from dashing the boats against the cliffs. Sometimes, where\r\nthe river is swift, we must put a bight of rope about a rock, to prevent\r\nthe boat from being snatched from us by a wave; but where the plunge\r\nis too great or the chute too swift, we must let her leap and catch her\r\nbelow or the undertow will drag her under the falling water and sink\r\nher. Where we wish to run her out a little way from shore through a\r\nchannel between rocks, we first throw in little sticks of driftwood and\r\nwatch their course, to see where we must steer so that she will pass the\r\nchannel in safety. And so we hold, and let go, and pull, and lift, and\r\nward--among rocks, around rocks, and over rocks.\r\n\r\nAnd now we go on through this solemn, mysterious way. The river is very\r\ndeep, the canyon very narrow, and still obstructed, so that there is no\r\nsteady flow of the stream; but the waters reel and roll and boil, and we\r\nare scarcely able to determine where we can go. Now the boat is carried\r\nto the right, perhaps close to the wall; again, she is shot into the\r\nstream, and perhaps is dragged over to the other side, where, caught in\r\na whirlpool, she spins about. We can neither land nor run as we please.\r\nThe boats are entirely unmanageable; no order in their running can be\r\npreserved; now one, now another, is ahead, each crew laboring for its\r\nown preservation. In such a place we come to another rapid. Two of the\r\nboats run it perforce. One succeeds in landing, but there is no foothold\r\nby which to make a portage and she is pushed out again into\r\n\r\n256 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthe stream. The next minute a great reflex wave fills the open\r\ncompartment; she is water-logged, and drifts unmanageable. Breaker after\r\nbreaker rolls over her and one capsizes her. The men are thrown out; but\r\nthey cling to the boat, and she drifts down some distance alongside of\r\nus and we are able to catch her. She is soon bailed out and the men are\r\naboard once more; but the oars are lost, and so a pair from the \"Emma\r\nDean\" is spared. Then for two miles we find smooth water.\r\n\r\nClouds are playing in the canyon to-day. Sometimes they roll down in\r\ngreat masses, filling the gorge with gloom; sometimes they hang aloft\r\nfrom wall to wall and cover the canyon with a roof of impending storm,\r\nand we can peer long distances up and down this canyon corridor, with\r\nits cloud-roof overhead, its walls of black granite, and its river\r\nbright with the sheen of broken waters. Then a gust of wind sweeps down\r\na side gulch and, making a rift in the clouds, reveals the blue heavens,\r\nand a stream of sunlight pours in. Then the clouds drift away into the\r\ndistance, and hang around crags and peaks and pinnacles and towers and\r\nwalls, and cover them with a mantle that lifts from time to time and\r\nsets them all in sharp relief. Then baby clouds creep out of side\r\ncanyons, glide around points, and creep back again into more distant\r\ngorges. Then clouds arrange in strata across the canyon, with\r\nintervening vista views to cliffs and rocks beyond. The clouds are\r\nchildren of the heavens, and when they play among the rocks they lift\r\nthem to the region above.\r\n\r\n256\r\n\r\nIt rains! Rapidly little rills are formed above, and these soon grow\r\ninto brooks, and the brooks grow into creeks and tumble over the walls\r\nin innumerable cascades, adding their wild music to the roar of the\r\nriver. When the rain ceases the rills, brooks, and creeks run dry. The\r\nwaters that fall during a rain on these steep rocks are gathered at once\r\ninto the river; they could scarcely be poured in more suddenly if some\r\nvast spout ran from the clouds to the stream itself. When a storm bursts\r\nover the canyon a side gulch is dangerous, for a sudden flood may come,\r\nand the inpouring waters will raise the river so as to hide the rocks.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon we discover a stream entering from the north--a\r\nclear, beautiful creek, coming down through a gorgeous red canyon.\r\nWe land and camp on a sand beach above its mouth, under a great,\r\noverspreading tree with willow-shaped leaves.\r\n\r\n257 powell-canyons-163.jpg\r\n\r\nSIGNAL OF DISCOVERY OR ALARM.\r\n\r\n258 powell-canyons-164.jpg\r\n\r\nSIGNAL, \"WHO ARE YOU?\" ANSWER, \"PANI.\"\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON. 259\r\n\r\nAugust 16.--We must dry our rations again to-day and make oars.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado is never a clear stream, but for the past three or four\r\ndays it has been raining much of the time, and the floods poured\r\nover the walls have brought down great quantities of mud, making it\r\nexceedingly turbid now. The little affluent which we have discovered\r\nhere is a clear, beautiful creek, or river, as it would be termed in\r\nthis western country, where streams are not abundant. We have named one\r\nstream, away above, in honor of the great chief of the \"Bad Angels,\" and\r\nas this is in beautiful contrast to that, we conclude to name it \"Bright\r\nAngel.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning the whole party starts up to explore the Bright\r\nAngel River, with the special purpose of seeking timber from which to\r\nmake oars. A couple of miles above we find a large pine log, which has\r\nbeen floated down from the plateau, probably from an altitude of more\r\nthan 6,000 feet, but not many miles back. On its way it must have passed\r\nover many cataracts and falls, for it bears scars in evidence of the\r\nrough usage which it has received. The men roll it on skids, and the\r\nwork of sawing oars is commenced.\r\n\r\nThis stream heads away back under a line of abrupt cliffs that\r\nterminates the plateau, and tumbles down more than 4,000 feet in the\r\nfirst mile or two of its course; then runs through a deep, narrow canyon\r\nuntil it reaches the river.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon I return and go up a little gulch just above this\r\ncreek, about 200 yards from camp, and discover the ruins of two or three\r\nold houses, which were originally of stone laid in mortar. Only the\r\nfoundations are left, but irregular blocks, of which the houses\r\nwere constructed, lie scattered about. In one room I find an old\r\nmealing-stone, deeply worn, as if it had been much used. A great deal\r\nof pottery is strewn around, and old trails, which in some places are\r\ndeeply worn into the rocks, are seen.\r\n\r\nIt is ever a source of wonder to us why these ancient people sought\r\nsuch inaccessible places for their homes. They were, doubtless, an\r\nagricultural race, but there are no lands here of any considerable\r\nextent that they could have cultivated. To the west of Oraibi, one\r\nof the towns in the Province of Tusayan, in northern Arizona, the\r\ninhabitants have actually built little terraces along the face of the\r\ncliff where a\r\n\r\n260 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nspring gushes out, and thus made their sites for gardens. It is possible\r\nthat the ancient inhabitants of this place made their agricultural\r\nlands in the same way. But why should they seek such spots'? Surely the\r\ncountry was not so crowded with people as to demand the utilization of\r\nso barren a region. The only solution suggested of the problem is this:\r\nWe know that for a century or two after the settlement of Mexico many\r\nexpeditious were sent into the country now comprising Arizona and New\r\nMexico, for the purpose of bringing the town-building people under\r\nthe dominion of the Spanish government. Many of their villages were\r\ndestroyed, and the inhabitants fled to regions at that time unknown; and\r\nthere are traditions among the people who inhabit the pueblos that\r\nstill remain that the canyons were these unknown lauds. It may be these\r\nbuildings were erected at that time; sure it is that they have a much\r\nmore modern appearance than the ruins scattered over Nevada, Utah,\r\nColorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. Those old Spanish conquerors had\r\na monstrous greed for gold and a wonderful lust for saving souls.\r\nTreasures they must have, if not on earth, why, then, in heaven; and\r\nwhen they failed to find heathen temples bedecked with silver, they\r\npropitiated Heaven by seizing the heathen themselves. There is yet\r\nextant a copy of a record made by a heathen artist to express his\r\nconception of the demands of the conquerors. In one part of the picture\r\nwe have a lake, and near by stands a priest pouring water on the head of\r\na native. On the other side, a poor Indian has a cord about his throat.\r\nLines run from these two groups to a central figure, a man with beard\r\nand full Spanish panoply. The interpretation of the picture-writing is\r\nthis: \"Be baptized as this saved heathen, or be hanged as that damned\r\nheathen.\" Doubtless, some of these people preferred another alternative,\r\nand rather than be baptized or hanged they chose to imprison themselves\r\nwithin these canyon walls.\r\n\r\nAugust 17.--Our rations are still spoiling; the bacon is so badly\r\ninjured that we are compelled to throw it away. By an accident, this\r\nmorning, the saleratus was lost overboard. We have now only musty flour\r\nsufficient for ten days and a few dried apples, but plenty of coffee.\r\nWe must make all haste possible. If we meet with difficulties such as we\r\nhave encountered in the canyon above, we may be compelled to give up the\r\nexpedition and try to reach the Mormon settlements to the north.\r\n\r\n261 powell-canyons-165.jpg\r\n\r\nSIGNAL OF SUCCESSFUL WAR PARTY.\r\n\r\n262 powell-canyons-166.jpg\r\n\r\nA SIGNAL OF PEACE.\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON. 263\r\n\r\nOur hopes are that the worst places are passed, but our barometers are\r\nall so much injured as to be useless, and so we have lost our reckoning\r\nin altitude, and know not how much descent the river has yet to make.\r\nThe stream is still wild and rapid and rolls through a narrow channel.\r\nWe make but slow progress, often landing against a wall and climbing\r\naround some point to see the river below. Although very anxious to\r\nadvance, we are determined to run with great caution, lest by another\r\naccident we lose our remaining supplies. How precious that little flour\r\nhas become! We divide it among the boats and carefully store it away, so\r\nthat it can be lost only by the loss of the boat itself.\r\n\r\nWe make ten miles and a half, and camp among the rocks on the right.\r\nWe have had rain from time to time all day, and have been thoroughly\r\ndrenched and chilled; but between showers the sun shines with great\r\npower and the mercury in our thermometers stands at 115 degrees, so that\r\nwe have rapid changes from great extremes, which are very disagreeable.\r\nIt is especially cold in the rain to-night. The little canvas we have is\r\nrotten and useless; the rubber ponchos with which we started from Green\r\nRiver City have all been lost; more than half the party are without\r\nhats, not one of us has an entire suit of clothes, and we have not\r\na blanket apiece. So we gather driftwood and build a fire; but after\r\nsupper the rain, coming down in torrents, extinguishes it, and we sit up\r\nall night on the rocks, shivering, and are more exhausted by the night's\r\ndiscomfort than by the day's toil.\r\n\r\nAugust 18.--The day is employed in making portages and we advance but\r\ntwo miles on our journey. Still it rains.\r\n\r\nWhile the men are at work making portages I climb up the granite to\r\nits summit and go away back over the rust-colored sandstones and\r\ngreenish-yellow shales to the foot of the marble wall. I climb so\r\nhigh that the men and boats are lost in the black depths below and the\r\ndashing river is a rippling brook, and still there is more canyon above\r\nthan below. All about me are interesting geologic records. The book is\r\nopen and I can read as I run. All about me are grand views, too, for the\r\nclouds are playing again in the gorges. But somehow I think of the nine\r\ndays' rations and the bad river, and the lesson of the rocks and the\r\nglory of the scene are but half conceived. I push on to an angle, where\r\nI hope to get a view of the country\r\n\r\n264 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nbeyond, to see if possible what the prospect may be of our soon running\r\nthrough this plateau, or at least of meeting with some geologic change\r\nthat will let us out of the granite; but, arriving at the point, I can\r\nsee below only a labyrinth of black gorges.\r\n\r\nAugust 19.--Rain again this morning. We are in our granite prison still,\r\nand the time until noon is occupied in making a long; bad portage.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, in running a rapid the pioneer boat is upset by a wave. We\r\nare some distance in advance of the larger boats. The river is rough and\r\nswift and we are unable to land, but cling to the boat and are carried\r\ndown stream over another rapid. The men in the boats above see our\r\ntrouble, but they are caught in whirlpools and are spinning about in\r\neddies, and it seems a long time before they come to our relief. At last\r\nthey do come; our boat is turned right side up and bailed out; the oars,\r\nwhich fortunately have floated along in company with us, are gathered\r\nup, and on we go, without even landing. The clouds break away and we\r\nhave sunshine again.\r\n\r\nSoon we find a little beach with just room enough to land. Here we camp,\r\nbut there is no wood. Across the river and a little way above, we see\r\nsome driftwood lodged in the rocks. So we bring two boat loads over,\r\nbuild a huge fire, and spread everything to dry. It is the first\r\ncheerful night we have had for a week--a warm, drying fire in the midst\r\nof the camp, and a few bright stars in our patch of heavens overhead.\r\n\r\nAugust 20.--The characteristics of the canyon change this morning. The\r\nriver is broader, the walls more sloping, and composed of black slates\r\nthat stand on edge. These nearly vertical slates are washed out in\r\nplaces--that is, the softer beds are washed out between the harder,\r\nwhich are left standing. In this way curious little alcoves are formed,\r\nin which are quiet bays of water, but on a much smaller scale than the\r\ngreat bays and buttresses of Marble Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe river is still rapid and we stop to let down with lines several\r\ntimes, but make greater progress, as we run ten miles. We camp on the\r\nright bank. Here, on a terrace of trap, we discover another group of\r\nruins. There was evidently quite a village on this rock. Again we find\r\nmealing-stones and much broken pottery, and up on a little natural shelf\r\nin the rock back of the ruins we find a globular basket that would hold\r\n\r\n265 powell-canyons-167.jpg\r\n\r\nMOKI METHOD OF DRESSING THE HAIR.\r\n\r\n266 powell-canyons-168.jpg\r\n\r\nMOKI METHOD OF SPINNING.\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON. 267\r\n\r\nperhaps a third of a bushel. It is badly broken, and as I attempt to\r\ntake it up it falls to pieces. There are many beautiful flint chips,\r\nalso, as if this had been the home of an old arrow-maker.\r\n\r\nAugust 21.--We start early this morning, cheered by the prospect of a\r\nfine day and encouraged also by the good run made yesterday. A quarter\r\nof a mile below camp the river turns abruptly to the left, and between\r\ncamp and that point is very swift, running down in a long, broken chute\r\nand piling up against the foot of the cliff, where it turns to the\r\nleft. We try to pull across, so as to go down on the other side, but\r\nthe waters are swift and it seems impossible for us to escape the rock\r\nbelow; but, in pulling across, the bow of the boat is turned to the\r\nfarther shore, so that we are swept broadside down and are prevented by\r\nthe rebounding waters from striking against the wall. We toss about for\r\na few seconds in these billows and are then carried past the danger.\r\nBelow, the river turns again to the right, the canyon is very narrow,\r\nand we see in advance but a short distance. The water, too, is very\r\nswift, and there is no landing-place. From around this curve there comes\r\na mad roar, and down we are carried with a dizzying velocity to the\r\nhead of another rapid. On either side high over our heads there are\r\noverhanging granite walls, and the sharp bends cut off our view, so that\r\na few minutes will carry us into unknown waters. Away we go on one long,\r\nwinding chute. I stand on deck, supporting myself with a strap fastened\r\non either side of the gunwale. The boat glides rapidly where the water\r\nis smooth, then, striking a wave, she leaps and bounds like a thing of\r\nlife, and we have a wild, exhilarating ride for ten miles, which we\r\nmake in less than an hour. The excitement is so great that we forget the\r\ndanger until we hear the roar of a great fall below; then we back on our\r\noars and are carried slowly toward its head and succeed in landing just\r\nabove and find that we have to make another portage. At this we are\r\nengaged until some time after dinner.\r\n\r\nJust here we run out of the granite. Ten miles in less than half a day,\r\nand limestone walls below. Good cheer returns; we forget the storms and\r\nthe gloom and the cloud-covered canyons and the black granite and the\r\nraging river, and push our boats from shore in great glee.\r\n\r\nThough we are out of the granite, the river is still swift, and we wheel\r\nabout a point again to the right, and turn, so as to head back in the\r\n\r\n268 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO,\r\n\r\ndirection from which we came; this brings the granite in sight again,\r\nwith its narrow gorge and black crags; but we meet with no more great\r\nfalls or rapids. Still, we run cautiously and stop from time to time\r\nto examine some places which look bad. Yet we make ten miles this\r\nafternoon; twenty miles in all to-day.\r\n\r\nAugust 22.--We come to rapids again this morning and are occupied\r\nseveral hours in passing them, letting the boats down from rock to rock\r\nwith lines for nearly half a mile, and then have to make a long portage.\r\nWhile the men are engaged in this I climb the wall on the northeast to\r\na height of about 2,500 feet, where I can obtain a good view of a long\r\nstretch of canyon below. Its course is to the southwest. The walls\r\nseem to rise very abruptly for 2,500 or 3,000 feet, and then there is\r\na gently sloping terrace on each side for two or three miles, when we\r\nagain find cliffs, 1,500 or 2,000 feet high. From the brink of these the\r\nplateau stretches back to the north and south for a long distance. Away\r\ndown the canyon on the right wall I can see a group of mountains, some\r\nof which appear to stand on the brink of the canyon. The effect of the\r\nterrace is to give the appearance of a narrow winding valley with high\r\nwalls on either side and a deep, dark, meandering gorge down its middle.\r\nIt is impossible from this point of view to determine whether or not we\r\nhave granite at the bottom; but from geologic considerations, I conclude\r\nthat we shall have marble walls below.\r\n\r\nAfter my return to the boats we run another mile and camp for the night.\r\nWe have made but little over seven miles to-day, and a part of our flour\r\nhas been soaked in the river again.\r\n\r\nAugust 23.--Our way to-day is again through marble walls. Now and then\r\nwe pass for a short distance through patches of granite, like hills\r\nthrust up into the limestone. At one of these places we have to make\r\nanother portage, and, taking advantage of the delay, I go up a little\r\nstream to the north, wading it all the way, sometimes having to plunge\r\nin to my neck, in other places being compelled to swim across little\r\nbasins that have been excavated at the foot of the falls. Along its\r\ncourse are many cascades and springs, gushing out from the rocks on\r\neither side. Sometimes a cottonwood tree grows over the water. I come\r\nto one beautiful fall, of more than 150 feet, and climb around it to the\r\nright on the broken rocks. Still going up, the canyon is found to narrow\r\nvery\r\n\r\n269 powell-canyons-169.jpg\r\n\r\nAN ALCOVE IN THE RED WALL.\r\n\r\n270 powell-canyons-170.jpg\r\n\r\nKANAB CANYON, NEAR THE JUNCTION.\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON. 271\r\n\r\nmuch, being but 15 or 20 feet wide; yet the walls rise on either side\r\nmany hundreds of feet, perhaps thousands; I can hardly tell.\r\n\r\nIn some places the stream has not excavated its channel down vertically\r\nthrough the rocks, but has cut obliquely, so that one wall overhangs the\r\nother. In other places it is cut vertically above and obliquely below,\r\nor obliquely above and vertically below, so that it is impossible to\r\nsee out overhead. But I can go no farther; the time which I estimated it\r\nwould take to make the portage has almost expired, and I start back on\r\na round trot, wading in the creek where I must and plunging through\r\nbasins. The men are waiting for me, and away we go on the river.\r\n\r\nJust after dinner we pass a stream on the right, which leaps into' the\r\nColorado by a direct fall of more than 100 feet, forming a beautiful\r\ncascade. There is a bed of very hard rock above, 30 or 40 feet in\r\nthickness, and there are much softer beds below. The hard beds above\r\nproject many yards beyond the softer, which are washed out, forming a\r\ndeep cave behind the fall, and the stream pours through a narrow crevice\r\nabove into a deep pool below. Around on the rocks in the cavelike\r\nchamber are set beautiful ferns, with delicate fronds and enameled\r\nstalks. The frondlets have their points turned down to form spore cases.\r\nIt has very much the appearance of the maidenhair fern, but is much\r\nlarger. This delicate foliage covers the rocks all about the fountain,\r\nand gives the chamber great beauty. But we have little time to spend in\r\nadmiration; so on we go.\r\n\r\nWe make fine progress this afternoon, carried along by a swift river,\r\nshooting over the rapids and finding no serious obstructions. The\r\ncanyon walls for 2,500 or 3,000 feet are very regular, rising almost\r\nperpendicularly, but here and there set with narrow steps, and\r\noccasionally we can see away above the broad terrace to distant cliffs.\r\n\r\nWe camp to-night in a marble cave, and find on looking at our reckoning\r\nthat we have run 22 miles.\r\n\r\nAugust 24.--The canyon is wider to-day. The walls rise to a vertical\r\nheight of nearly 3,000 feet. In many places the river runs under a cliff\r\nin great curves, forming amphitheaters half-dome shaped.\r\n\r\nThough the river is rapid, we meet with no serious obstructions and\r\nrun 20 miles. How anxious we are to make up our reckoning every time we\r\nstop, now that our diet is confined to plenty of coffee, a very\r\n\r\n272 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nlittle spoiled flour, and very few dried apples! It has come to be a\r\nrace for a dinner. Still, we make such fine progress that all hands are\r\nin good cheer, but not a moment of daylight is lost.\r\n\r\nAugust 25.--We make 12 miles this morning, when we come to monuments of\r\nlava standing in the river,--low rocks mostly, but some of them shafts\r\nmore than a hundred feet high. Going on down three or four miles, we\r\nfind them increasing in number. Great quantities of cooled lava and\r\nmany cinder cones are seen on either side; and then we come to an abrupt\r\ncataract. Just over the fall on the right wall a cinder cone, or extinct\r\nvolcano, with a well-defined crater, stands on the very brink of the\r\ncanyon. This, doubtless, is the one we saw two or three days ago. From\r\nthis volcano vast floods of lava have been poured down into the river,\r\nand a stream of molten rock has run up the canyon three or four miles\r\nand down we know not how far. Just where it poured over the canyon wall\r\nis the fall. The whole north side as far as we can see is lined with the\r\nblack basalt, and high up on the opposite wall are patches of the same\r\nmaterial, resting on the benches and filling old alcoves and caves,\r\ngiving the wall a spotted appearance.\r\n\r\nThe rocks are broken in two along a line which here crosses the river,\r\nand the beds we have seen while coming down the canyon for the last 30\r\nmiles have dropped 800 feet on the lower side of the line, forming what\r\ngeologists call a \"fault.\" The volcanic cone stands directly over the\r\nfissure thus formed. On the left side of the river, opposite, mammoth\r\nsprings burst out of this crevice, 100 or 200 feet above the river,\r\npouring in a stream quite equal in volume to the Colorado Chiquito.\r\n\r\nThis stream seems to be loaded with carbonate of lime, and the water,\r\nevaporating, leaves an incrustation on the rocks; and this process has\r\nbeen continued for a long time, for extensive deposits are noticed in\r\nwhich are basins with bubbling springs. The water is salty.\r\n\r\nWe have to make a portage here, which is completed in about three hours;\r\nthen on we go.\r\n\r\nWe have no difficulty as we float along, and I am able to observe the\r\nwonderful phenomena connected with this flood of lava. The canyon was\r\ndoubtless filled to a height of 1,200 or 1,500 feet, perhaps by more\r\nthan one flood. This would dam the water back; and in cutting through\r\nthis great lava bed, a new channel has been formed, sometimes on one\r\n\r\n273 powell-canyons-171.jpg\r\n\r\nKANAB CANYON, IN THE RED WALL LIMESTONE.\r\n\r\n274 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nside, sometimes on the other. The cooled lava, being of firmer texture\r\nthan the rocks of which the walls are composed, remains in some places;\r\nin others a narrow channel has been cut, leaving a line of basalt on\r\neither side. It is possible that the lava cooled faster on the sides\r\nagainst the walls and that the center ran out; but of this we can only\r\nconjecture. There are other places where almost the whole of the lava is\r\ngone, only patches of it being seen, where it has caught on the walls.\r\nAs we float down we can see that it ran out into side canyons. In some\r\nplaces this basalt has a fine, columnar structure, often in concentric\r\nprisms, and masses of these concentric columns have coalesced. In some\r\nplaces, when the flow occurred the canyon was probably about the same\r\ndepth that it is now, for we can see where the basalt has rolled out on\r\nthe sands, and--what seems curious to me--the sands are not melted or\r\nmetamorphosed to any appreciable extent. In places the bed of the river\r\nis of sandstone or limestone, in other places of lava, showing that it\r\nhas all been cut out again where the sandstones and limestones appear;\r\nbut there is a little yet left where the bed is of lava.\r\n\r\nWhat a conflict of water and fire there must have been here! Just\r\nimagine a river of molten rock running down into a river of melted snow.\r\nWhat a seething and boiling of the waters; what clouds of steam rolled\r\ninto the heavens!\r\n\r\nThirty-five miles to-day. Hurrah!\r\n\r\nAugust 26.--The canyon walls are steadily becoming higher as we advance.\r\nThey are still bold and nearly vertical up to the terrace. We still see\r\nevidence of the eruption discovered yesterday, but the thickness of the\r\nbasalt is decreasing as we go down stream; yet it has been reinforced\r\nat points by streams that have come down from volcanoes standing on the\r\nterrace above, but which we cannot see from the river below.\r\n\r\nSince we left the Colorado Chiquito we have seen no evidences that the\r\ntribe of Indians inhabiting the plateaus on either side ever come down\r\nto the river; but about eleven o'clock to-day we discover an Indian\r\ngarden at the foot of the wall on the right, just where a little stream\r\nwith a narrow flood plain comes down through a side canyon. Along the\r\nvalley the Indians have planted corn, using for irrigation the water\r\nwhich bursts out in springs at the foot of the cliff. The corn is\r\nlooking quite\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\n275\r\n\r\nwell, but it is not sufficiently advanced to give us roasting ears; but\r\nthere are some nice green squashes. We carry ten or a dozen of these\r\non board our boats and hurriedly leave, not willing to be caught in the\r\nrobbery, yet excusing ourselves by pleading our great want. We run down\r\na short distance to where we feel certain no Indian can follow, and what\r\na kettle of squash sauce we make! True, we have no salt with which to\r\nseason it, but it makes a fine addition to our unleavened bread and\r\ncoffee. Never was fruit so sweet as these stolen squashes.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we push on again and make fine time, finding many rapids,\r\nbut none so bad that we cannot run them with safety; and when we stop,\r\njust at dusk, and foot up our reckoning, we find we have run 35 miles\r\nagain. A few days like this, and we are out of prison.\r\n\r\nWe have a royal supper--unleavened bread, green squash sauce, and strong\r\ncoffee. We have been for a few days on half rations, but now have no\r\nstint of roast squash. powell-canyons-172.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE BRINK OF THE INNER GORGE.\r\n\r\n276 powell-canyons-173.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO, SHOWING AMPHITHEATER AND SCULPTURED\r\nBUTTES.\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON. 277\r\n\r\nAugust 27.--This morning the river takes a more southerly direction. The\r\ndip of the rocks is to the north and we are running rapidly into lower\r\nformations. Unless our course changes we shall very soon run again into\r\nthe granite. This gives some anxiety. Now and then the river turns to\r\nthe west and excites hopes that are soon destroyed by another turn to\r\nthe south. About nine o'clock we come to the dreaded rock. It is with no\r\nlittle misgiving that we see the river enter these black, hard walls.\r\nAt its very entrance we have to make a portage; then let down with lines\r\npast some ugly rocks. We run a mile or two farther, and then the rapids\r\nbelow can be seen.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o'clock we come to a place in the river which seems much\r\nworse than any we have yet met in all its course. A little creek comes\r\ndown from the left. We land first on the right and clamber up over the\r\ngranite pinnacles for a mile or two, but can see no way by which to let\r\ndown, and to run it would be sure destruction. After dinner we cross to\r\nexamine on the left. High above the river we can walk along on the top\r\nof the granite, which is broken off at the edge and set with crags and\r\npinnacles, so that it is very difficult to get a view of the river at\r\nall. In my eagerness to reach a point where I can see the roaring fall\r\nbelow, I go too far on the wall, and can neither advance nor retreat. I\r\nstand with one foot on a little projecting rock and cling with my hand\r\nfixed in a little crevice. Finding I am caught here, suspended 400 feet\r\nabove the river, into which I must fall if my footing fails, I call for\r\nhelp. The men come and pass me a line, but I cannot let go of the rock\r\nlong enough to take hold of it. Then they bring two or three of the\r\nlargest oars. All this takes time which seems very precious to me;\r\nbut at last they arrive. The blade of one of the oars is pushed into a\r\nlittle crevice in the rock beyond me in such a manner that they can hold\r\nme pressed against the wall. Then another is fixed in such a way that I\r\ncan step on it; and thus I am extricated.\r\n\r\nStill another hour is spent in examining the river from this side, but\r\nno good view of it is obtained; so now we return to the side that was\r\nfirst examined, and the afternoon is spent in clambering among the crags\r\nand pinnacles and carefully scanning the river again. We find that the\r\nlateral streams have washed boulders into the river, so as to form a\r\ndam, over which the water makes a broken fall of 18 or 20 feet; then\r\nthere is\r\n\r\n278 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\na rapid, beset with rocks, for 200 or 300 yards, while on the other\r\nside, points of the wall project into the river. Below, there is a\r\nsecond fall; how great, we cannot tell. Then there is a rapid, filled\r\nwith huge rocks, for 100 or 200 yards. At the bottom of it, from the\r\nright wall, a great rock projects quite halfway across the river. It has\r\na sloping surface extending up stream, and the water, coming down with\r\nall the momentum gained in the falls and rapids above, rolls up this\r\ninclined plane many feet, and tumbles over to the left. I decide that\r\nit is possible to let down over the first fall, then run near the right\r\ncliff to a point just above the second, where we can pull out into a\r\nlittle chute, and, having run over that in safety, if we pull with all\r\nour power across the stream, we may avoid the great rock below. On my\r\nreturn to the boat I announce to the men that we are to run it in the\r\nmorning. Then we cross the river and go into camp for the night on some\r\nrocks in the mouth of the little side canyon.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Captain Howland asks to have a talk with me. We walk up\r\nthe little creek a short distance, and I soon find that his object is to\r\nremonstrate against my determination to proceed. He thinks that we had\r\nbetter abandon the river here. Talking with him, I learn that he, his\r\nbrother, and William Dunn have determined to go no farther in the boats.\r\nSo we return to camp. Nothing is said to the other men.\r\n\r\nFor the last two days our course has not been plotted. I sit down and do\r\nthis now, for the purpose of finding where we are by dead reckoning.\r\nIt is a clear night, and I take out the sextant to make observation\r\nfor latitude, and I find that the astronomic determination agrees very\r\nnearly with that of the plot--quite as closely as might be expected from\r\na meridian observation on a planet. In a direct line, we must be about\r\n45 miles from the mouth of the Rio Virgen. If we can reach that point,\r\nwe know that there are settlements up that river about 20 miles. This 45\r\nmiles in a direct line will probably be 80 or 90 by the meandering line\r\nof the river. But then we know that there is comparatively open country\r\nfor many miles above the mouth of the Virgen, which is our point of\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I determine all this, I spread my plot on the sand and wake\r\nHowland, who is sleeping down by the river, and show him where I suppose\r\nwe are, and where several Mormon settlements are situated.\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\n279\r\n\r\nWe have another short talk about the morrow, and he lies down again;\r\nbut for me there is no sleep. All night long I pace up and down a little\r\npath, on a few yards of sand beach, along by the river. Is it wise to\r\ngo on? I go to the boats again to look at our rations. I feel satisfied\r\nthat we can get over the danger immediately before us; what there may be\r\nbelow I know not. From our outlook yesterday on the cliffs, the canyon\r\nseemed to make another great bend to the south, and this, from our\r\nexperience heretofore, means more and higher granite walls. I am not\r\nsure that we can climb out of the canyon here, and, if at the top of the\r\nwall, I know enough of the country to be certain that it is a desert of\r\nrock and sand between this and the nearest Mormon town, which, on the\r\nmost direct line, must be 75 miles away. True, the late rains have been\r\nfavorable to us, should we go out, for the probabilities are that we\r\nshall find water still standing in holes; and at one time I almost\r\nconclude to leave the river. But for years I have powell-canyons-174.jpg\r\n\r\nCLIMBING THE GRAND CANYON WALL.\r\n\r\n280 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nbeen contemplating this trip. To leave the exploration unfinished, to\r\nsay that there is a part of the canyon which I cannot explore,\r\nhaving already nearly accomplished it, is more than I am willing to\r\nacknowledge, and I determine to go on.\r\n\r\nI wake my brother and tell him of Howland's determination, and he\r\npromises to stay with me; then I call up Hawkins, the cook, and he makes\r\na like promise; then Sumner and Bradley and Hall, and they all agree to\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\nAugust 28.--At last daylight comes and we have breakfast without a word\r\nbeing said about the future. The meal is as solemn as a funeral. After\r\nbreakfast I ask the three men if they still think it best to leave us.\r\nThe elder Howland thinks it is, and Dunn agrees with him. The younger\r\nHowland tries to persuade them to go on with the party; failing in\r\nwhich, he decides to go with his brother.\r\n\r\nThen we cross the river. The small boat is very much disabled and\r\nunseaworthy. With the loss of hands, consequent on the departure of the\r\nthree men, we shall not be able to run all of the boats; so I decide to\r\nleave my \"Emma Dean.\"\r\n\r\nTwo rifles and a shotgun are given to the men who are going out. I ask\r\nthem to help themselves to the rations and take what they think to be\r\na fair share. This they refuse to do, saying they have no fear but\r\nthat they can get something to eat; but Billy, the cook, has a pan of\r\nbiscuits prepared for dinner, and these he leaves on a rock.\r\n\r\nBefore starting, we take from the boat our barometers, fossils, the\r\nminerals, and some ammunition and leave them on the rocks. We are going\r\nover this place as light as possible. The three men help us lift our\r\nboats over a rock 25 or 30 feet high and let them down again over the\r\nfirst fall, and now we are all ready to start. The last thing before\r\nleaving, I write a letter to my wife and give it to Howland. Sumner\r\ngives him his watch, directing that it be sent to his sister should he\r\nnot be heard from again. The records of the expedition have been kept in\r\nduplicate. One set of these is given to Howland; and now we are ready.\r\nFor the last time they entreat us not to go on, and tell us that it is\r\nmadness to set out in this place; that we can never get safely through\r\nit; and, further, that the river turns again to the south into the\r\ngranite, and a few miles of such rapids and falls will exhaust our\r\nentire stock of rations, and then\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\n281\r\n\r\nit will be too late to climb out. Some tears are shed; it is rather\r\na solemn parting; each party thinks the other is taking the dangerous\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nMy old boat left, I go on board of the \"Maid of the Canyon.\" The three\r\nmen climb a crag that overhangs the river to watch us off. The \"Maid\r\nof the Canyon\" pushes out. We glide rapidly along the foot of the wall,\r\njust grazing one great rock, then pull out a little into the chute of\r\nthe second fall and plunge over it. The open compartment is filled when\r\nwe strike the first wave below, but we cut through it, and then the men\r\npull with all their power toward the left wall and swing clear of the\r\ndangerous rock below all right. We are scarcely a minute in running it,\r\nand find that, although it looked bad from above, we have passed many\r\nplaces that were worse. The other boat follows without more difficulty.\r\nWe land at the first powell-canyons-175.jpg\r\n\r\nTRIANGULATION STATION.\r\n\r\n282 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\npracticable point below, and fire our guns, as a signal to the men above\r\nthat we have come over in safety. Here we remain a couple of hours,\r\nhoping that they will take the smaller boat and follow us. We are behind\r\na curve in the canyon and cannot see up to where we left them, and so we\r\nwait until their coming seems hopeless, and then push on.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have a succession of rapids and falls until noon, all of\r\nwhich we run in safety. Just after dinner we come to another bad place.\r\nA little stream comes in from the left, and below there is a fall, and\r\nstill below another fall. Above, the river tumbles down, over and among\r\nthe rocks, in whirlpools and great waves, and the waters are lashed into\r\nmad, white foam. We run along the left, above this, and soon see that we\r\ncannot get down on this side, but it seems possible to let down on the\r\nother. We pull up stream again for 200 or 300 yards and cross. Now there\r\nis a bed of basalt on this northern side of the canyon, with a bold\r\nescarpment that seems to be a hundred feet high. We can climb it and\r\nwalk along its summit to a point where we are just at the head of the\r\nfall. Here the basalt is broken down again, so it seems to us, and I\r\ndirect the men to take a line to the top of the cliff and let the boats\r\ndown along the wall. One man remains in the boat to keep her clear\r\nof the rocks and prevent her line from being caught on the projecting\r\nangles. I climb the cliff and pass along to a point just over the fall\r\nand descend by broken rocks, and find that the break of the fall is\r\nabove the break of the wall, so that we cannot land, and that still\r\nbelow the river is very bad, and that there is no possibility of a\r\nportage. Without waiting further to examine and determine what shall\r\nbe done, I hasten back to the top of the cliff to stop the boats from\r\ncoming down. When I arrive I find the men have let one of them down to\r\nthe head of the fall. She is in swift water and they are not able to\r\npull her back; nor are they able to go on with the line, as it is not\r\nlong enough to reach the higher part of the cliff which is just before\r\nthem; so they take a bight around a crag. I send two men back for the\r\nother line. The boat is in very swift water, and Bradley is standing in\r\nthe open compartment, holding out his oar to prevent her from striking\r\nagainst the foot of the cliff. Now she shoots out into the stream and\r\nup as far as the line will permit, and then, wheeling, drives headlong\r\nagainst the rock, and then out and back again, now straining\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\n283\r\n\r\non the line, now striking against the rock. As soon as the second line\r\nis brought, we pass it down to him; but his attention is all taken up\r\nwith his own situation, and he does not see that we are passing him the\r\nline. I stand on a projecting rock, waving my hat to gain his attention,\r\nfor my voice is drowned by the roaring of the falls. Just at this moment\r\nI see him take his knife from its sheath and step forward to cut the\r\nline. He has evidently decided that it is better to go over with the\r\nboat as it is than to wait for her to be broken to pieces. As he leans\r\nover, the boat sheers again into the stream, the stem-post breaks away\r\nand she is loose. With perfect composure Bradley seizes the great scull\r\noar, places it in the stern rowlock, and pulls with all his power (and\r\nhe is an athlete) to turn the bow of the boat down stream, for he wishes\r\nto go bow down, rather than to drift broadside on. One, two strokes he\r\nmakes, and a third just as she goes over, and the boat is fairly turned,\r\nand she goes down almost beyond our sight, though we are more than a\r\nhundred feet above the river. Then she comes up again on a great wave,\r\nand down and up, then around behind some great rocks, and is lost in the\r\nmad, white foam below. We stand frozen with fear, for we see no boat.\r\nBradley is gone! so it seems. But now, away below, we see something\r\ncoming out of the waves. It is evi- powell-canyons-176.jpg\r\n\r\nCAVATE HOUSES\r\n\r\n284 CANTONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\ndently a boat. A moment more, and we see Bradley standing on deck,\r\nswinging his hat to show that he is all right. But he is in a whirlpool.\r\nWe have the stem-post of his boat attached to the line. How badly she\r\nmay be disabled we know not. I direct Sumner and Powell to pass along\r\nthe cliff and see if they can reach him from below. Hawkins, Hall, and\r\nmyself run to the other boat, jump aboard, push out, and away we go over\r\nthe falls. A wave rolls over us and our boat is unmanageable. Another\r\ngreat wave strikes us, and the boat rolls over, and tumbles and tosses,\r\nI know not how. All I know is that Bradley is picking us up. We soon\r\nhave all right again, and row to the cliff and wait until Sumner and\r\nPowell can come. After a difficult climb they reach us. We run two or\r\nthree miles farther and turn again to the northwest, continuing until\r\nnight, when we have run out of the granite once more.\r\n\r\nAugust 29.--We start very early this morning. The river still continues\r\nswift, but we have no serious difficulty, and at twelve o'clock emerge\r\nfrom the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. We are in a valley now, and\r\nlow mountains are seen in the distance, coming to the river below. We\r\nrecognize this as the Grand Wash.\r\n\r\nA few years ago a party of Mormons set out from St. George, Utah, taking\r\nwith them a boat, and came down to the Grand Wash, where they divided,\r\na portion of the party crossing the river to explore the San Francisco\r\nMountains. Three men--Hamblin, Miller, and Crosby--taking the boat, went\r\non down the river to Callville, landing a few miles below the mouth of\r\nthe Rio Virgen. We have their manuscript journal with us, and so the\r\nstream is comparatively well known.\r\n\r\nTo-night we camp on the left bank, in a mesquite thicket.\r\n\r\nThe relief from danger and the joy of success are great. When he who\r\nhas been chained by wounds to a hospital cot until his canvas tent seems\r\nlike a dungeon cell, until the groans of those who lie about tortured\r\nwith probe and knife are piled up, a weight of horror on his ears that\r\nhe cannot throw off, cannot forget, and until the stench of festering\r\nwounds and anaesthetic drugs has filled the air with its loathsome\r\nburthen,--when he at last goes out into the open field, what a world he\r\nsees! How beautiful the sky, how bright the sunshine, what \"floods of\r\ndelirious music\" pour from the throats of birds, how sweet the fragrance\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\n285\r\n\r\nof earth and tree and blossom! The first hour of convalescent freedom\r\nseems rich recompense for all pain and gloom and terror.\r\n\r\nSomething like these are the feelings we experience to-night. Ever\r\nbefore us has been an unknown danger, heavier than immediate peril.\r\nEvery waking hour passed in the Grand Canyon has been one of toil. We\r\nhave watched with deep solicitude the steady disappearance of our scant\r\nsupply of rations, and from time to time have seen the river snatch a\r\nportion of the little left, while we were a-hungered. And danger and\r\ntoil were endured in those gloomy depths, where ofttimes clouds hid the\r\nsky by day and but a narrow zone of stars could be seen at night. Only\r\nduring the few hours of deep sleep, consequent on hard labor, has the\r\nroar of the waters been hushed. Now the danger is over, now the toil has\r\nceased, now the gloom has disappeared, now the firmament is bounded only\r\nby the horizon, and what a vast expanse of constellations can be seen!\r\n\r\nThe river rolls by us in silent majesty; the quiet of the camp is sweet;\r\nour joy is almost ecstasy. We sit till long after midnight talking of\r\nthe Grand Canyon, talking of home, but talking chiefly of the three men\r\nwho left us. Are they wandering in those depths, unable to find a way\r\nout? Are they searching over the desert lands above for water? Or are\r\nthey nearing the settlements?\r\n\r\nAugust 30.--We run in two or three short, low canyons to-day, and on\r\nemerging from one we discover a band of Indians in the valley below.\r\nThey see us, and scamper away in eager haste to hide among the rocks.\r\nAlthough we land and call for them to return, not an Indian can be seen.\r\npowell-canyons-177.jpg\r\n\r\nSTANDING BOCKS.\r\n\r\n286 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nTwo or three miles farther down, in turning a short bend of the river,\r\nwe come upon another camp. So near are we before they can see us that I\r\ncan shout to them, and, being able to speak a little of their language,\r\nI tell them we are friends; but they all flee to the rocks, except a\r\nman, a woman, and two children. We land and talk with them. They are\r\nwithout lodges, but have built little shelters of boughs, under which'\r\nthey wallow in the sand. The man is dressed in a hat; the woman, in a\r\nstring of beads only. At first they are evidently much terrified; but\r\nwhen I talk to them in their own language and tell them we are friends,\r\nand inquire after people in the Mormon towns, they are soon reassured\r\nand beg for tobacco. Of this precious article we have none to spare.\r\nSumner looks around in the boat for something to give them, and finds\r\na little piece of colored soap, which they receive as a valuable\r\npresent,--rather as a thing of beauty than as a useful commodity,\r\nhowever. They are either unwilling or unable to tell us anything about\r\nthe Indians or white people, and so we push off, for we must lose no\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWe camp at noon under the right bank. And now as we push out we are in\r\ngreat expectancy, for we hope every minute to discover the mouth of the\r\nRio Virgen. Soon one of the men exclaims: \"Yonder's an Indian in the\r\nriver.\" Looking for a few minutes, we certainly do see two or three\r\npersons. The men bend to their oars and pull toward them. Approaching,\r\nwe see that there are three white men and an Indian hauling a seine, and\r\nthen we discover that it is just at the mouth of the long-sought river.\r\n\r\nAs we come near, the men seem far less surprised to see us than we do to\r\nsee them. They evidently know who we are, and on talking with them they\r\ntell us that we have been reported lost long ago, and that some weeks\r\nbefore a messenger had been sent from Salt Lake City with instructions\r\nfor them to watch for any fragments or relics of our party that might\r\ndrift down the stream.\r\n\r\nOur new-found friends, Mr. Asa and his two sons, tell us that they are\r\npioneers of a town that is to be built on the bank. Eighteen or twenty\r\nmiles up the valley of the Rio Virgen there are two Mormon towns,\r\nSt. Joseph and St. Thomas. To-night we dispatch an Indian to the\r\nlast-mentioned place to bring any letters that may be there for us.\r\n\r\nOur arrival here is very opportune. When we look over our store of\r\n\r\nTO THE FOOT OF THE GRAND CANTON.\r\n\r\n287\r\n\r\nsupplies, we find about 10 pounds of flour, 15 pounds of dried apples,\r\nbut 70 or 80 pounds of coffee.\r\n\r\nAugust 31.--This afternoon the Indian returns with a letter informing us\r\nthat Bishop Leithhead of St. Thomas and two or three other Mormons\r\nare coming down with a wagon, bringing us supplies. They arrive about\r\nsundown. Mr. Asa treats us with great kindness to the extent of his\r\nability; but Bishop Leithhead brings in his wagon two or three dozen\r\nmelons and many other little luxuries, and we are comfortable once more.\r\n\r\nSeptember 1.--This morning Sumner, Bradley, Hawkins, and Hall, taking on\r\na small supply of rations, start down the Colorado with the boats. It is\r\ntheir intention to go to Fort Mojave, and perhaps from there overland to\r\nLos Angeles.\r\n\r\nCaptain Powell and myself return with Bishop Leithhead to St. Thomas.\r\nFrom St. Thomas we go to Salt Lake City. powell-canyons-178.jpg\r\n\r\n288 powell-canyons-179.jpg\r\n\r\nMOUNT TRUMBULL, FROM MOUNT LOGAN.\r\n\r\n289\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nA YEAR has passed, and we have determined to resume the exploration of\r\nthe canyons of the Colorado. Our last trip was so hurried, owing to the\r\nloss of rations, and the scientific instruments were so badly injured,\r\nthat we are not satisfied with the results obtained; so we shall once\r\nmore attempt to pass through the canyons in boats, devoting two or three\r\nyears to the trip.\r\n\r\nIt will not be possible to carry in the boats sufficient supplies for\r\nthe party for that length of time; so it is thought best to establish\r\ndepots of supplies, at intervals of 100 or 200 miles along the river.\r\n\r\nBetween Gunnison's Crossing and the foot of the Grand Canyon, we know of\r\nonly two points where the river can be reached--one at the Crossing of\r\nthe Fathers, and another a few miles below, at the mouth of the\r\nParia, on a route which has been explored by Jacob Hamblin, a Mormon\r\nmissionary. These two points are so near each other that only one of\r\nthem can be selected for the purpose above mentioned, and others must\r\nbe found. We have been unable up to this time to obtain, either from\r\nIndians or white men, any information which will give us a clue to any\r\nother trail to the river.\r\n\r\nAt the headwaters of the Sevier, we are on the summit of a great\r\nwatershed. The Sevier itself flows north and then westward into the\r\nlake of the same name. The Rio Virgen, heading near by, flows to the\r\nsouthwest into the Colorado, 60 or 70 miles below the Grand Canyon. The\r\nKanab, also heading near by, runs directly south into the very heart\r\nof the Grand Canyon. The Paria, likewise heading near by, runs a little\r\nsouth of east and enters the river at the head of Marble Canyon. To the\r\nnortheast from this point, other streams which run into the Colorado\r\nhave their sources, until, 40 or 50 miles away, we reach the\r\n\r\n290\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nsouthern branches of the Dirty Devil River, the mouth of which stream is\r\nbut a short distance below the junction of the Grand and Green.\r\n\r\nThe Paunsa'gunt Plateau terminates in a point, which is bounded by a\r\nline of beautiful pink cliffs. At the foot of this plateau, on the west,\r\nthe Rio Virgen and Sevier River are dovetailed together, as their minute\r\nupper branches interlock. The upper surface of the plateau inclines to\r\n\r\nthe northeast, so that its waters roll off into the Sevier; but from the\r\nfoot of the cliffs, quite around the sharp angle of the plateau, for a\r\ndozen miles, we find numerous springs, whose waters unite to form the\r\nKanab. A little farther to the northeast the springs gather into streams\r\nthat feed the Paria. Here, by the upper springs of the Kanab, we make\r\na camp, and from this point we are to radiate on a series of trips,\r\nsouthwest, south, and east.\r\n\r\nJacob Hamblin, who has been a missionary among the Indians for more\r\nthan twenty years, has collected a number of Kai'vavits, with\r\nChuar'-ruumpeak, their chief, and they are all camped with us. They\r\nassure us that we cannot reach the river, that we cannot make our way\r\ninto the depths of the canyon, but promise to show us the springs and\r\nwater pockets, which are very scarce in all powell-canyons-180.jpg\r\n\r\nMARY'S VEIL; THE UPPER FALL ON PINE CREEK, A SMALL TRIBUTARY OF THE\r\nSEVIER.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n291\r\n\r\nthis region, and to give us all the information in their power. Here we\r\nfit up a pack train, for our bedding and instruments and supplies are to\r\nbe carried on the backs of mules and ponies.\r\n\r\nSeptember 5, 1870.--The several members of the party are engaged in\r\ngeneral preparation for our trip down to the Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\nTaking with me a white man and an Indian, I start on a climb to the\r\nsummit of the Paunsa'gunt Plateau, which rises above us on the east. Our\r\nway for a mile or more is over a great peat bog, which trembles under\r\nour feet, and now and then a mule sinks through the broken turf and we\r\nare compelled to pull it out with ropes. Passing the bog, our way is up\r\na gulch at the foot of the Pink Cliffs, which form the escarpment, or\r\nwall, of the great plateau. Soon we leave the gulch and climb a long\r\nridge which winds around to the right toward the summit of the great\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nTwo hours' riding, climbing, and clambering bring us near the top.\r\nWe look below and see clouds drifting up from the south and rolling\r\ntumultuously toward the foot of the cliffs beneath us. Soon all the\r\ncountry below is covered with a sea of vapor--a billowy, raging,\r\nnoiseless sea--and as the vapory flood still rolls up from the south,\r\ngreat waves dash against the powell-canyons-181.jpg\r\n\r\nPILLING CASCADE, THE LOWER FALLS ON PINE CEEEK.\r\n\r\n292\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO. powell-canyons-182.jpg\r\n\r\nABORIGINAL LADDER.\r\n\r\nfoot of the cliffs and roll back; another tide comes in, is hurled back,\r\nand another and another, lashing the cliffs until the fog rises to the\r\nsummit and covers us all. There is a heavy pine and fir forest above,\r\nbeset with dead and fallen timber, and we make our way through the\r\nundergrowth to the east.\r\n\r\nIt rains. The clouds discharge their moisture in torrents, and we make\r\nfor ourselves shelters of boughs, only to be soon abandoned, and we\r\nstand shivering by a great fire of pine logs and boughs, which the\r\npelting storm half extinguishes.\r\n\r\nOne, two, three, four hours of the storm, and at last it partially\r\nabates. During this time our animals, which we have turned loose, have\r\nsought for themselves shelter under the trees, and two of them have\r\nwandered away beyond our sight. I go out to follow their tracks, and\r\ncome near to the brink of a ledge of rocks, which, in the fog and mist,\r\nI suppose to be a little ridge, and I look for a way by which I can go\r\ndown. Standing just here, there is a rift made in the fog below by some\r\ncurrent or blast of wind, which reveals an almost bottomless abyss. I\r\nlook from the brink of a great precipice of more than 2,000 feet;\r\nbut through the mist the forms are half obscured and all reckoning of\r\ndistance is lost, and it seems 10,000 feet, ten miles--any distance the\r\nimagination desires to make it.\r\n\r\nCatching our animals, we return to the camp. We find that the little\r\nstreams which come down from the plateau are greatly swollen, but at\r\ncamp they have had no rain. The clouds which drifted up from the south,\r\nstriking against the plateau, were lifted up into colder regions and\r\ndischarged their moisture on the summit and against the sides of the\r\nplateau, but there was no rain in the valley below.\r\n\r\nSeptember 9.--We make a fair start this morning from the beautiful\r\nmeadow at the head of the Kanab, cross the line of little hills at the\r\nheadwaters of the Rio Virgen, and pass, to the south, a pretty valley.\r\nAt ten o'clock we come to the brink of a great geographic bench--a line\r\nof\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n293\r\n\r\ncliffs. Behind us are cool springs, green meadows, and forest-clad\r\nslopes; below us, stretching to the south until the world is lost in\r\nblue haze, is a painted desert--not a desert plain, but a desert of\r\nrocks cut by deep gorges and relieved by towering cliffs and pinnacled\r\nrocks--naked rocks, brilliant in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nBy a difficult trail we make our way down the basaltic ledge, through\r\nwhich innumerable streams here gather into a little river running in\r\na deep canyon. The river runs close to the foot of the cliffs on the\r\nright-hand side and the trail passes along to the right. At noon we rest\r\nand our animals feed on luxuriant grass.\r\n\r\nAgain we start and make slow progress along a stony way. At night we\r\ncamp under an overarching cliff.\r\n\r\nSeptember 10.--Here the river turns to the west, and our way, properly,\r\nis to the south; but we wish to explore the Rio Virgen as far as\r\npossible. The Indians tell us that the canyon narrows gradually a few\r\nmiles below and that it will be impossible to take our animals much\r\nfarther down the river. Early in the morning I go down to examine the\r\nhead of this narrow part. After breakfast, having concluded to explore\r\nthe canyon for a few miles on foot, we arrange that the main party\r\nshall climb the cliff and go around to a point 18 or 20 \\ miles below,\r\nwhere, the Indians say, the animals can be taken down by the river, and\r\nthree of us set out on, foot.\r\n\r\nThe Indian name of the canyon is Paru'nuweap, or Roaring Water Canyon.\r\nBetween the little river and the foot of the walls is a dense growth of\r\nwillows, vines, and wild rosebushes, and with great difficulty we make\r\nour way through this tangled mass. It is not a wide stream--only 20 or\r\n30 feet across in most places; shallow, but very swift. After spending\r\nsome hours in breaking our way through the mass of vegetation and\r\nclimbing rocks here and there, it is determined to wade along the\r\nstream. In some places this is an easy task, but here and there we come\r\nto deep holes where we have to wade to our armpits. Soon we come to\r\nplaces so narrow powell-canyons-183.jpg\r\n\r\nANOTHER STYLE OF LADDER.\r\n\r\n294 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthat the river fills the entire channel and we wade perforce. In many\r\nplaces the bottom is a quicksand, into which we sink, and it is with\r\ngreat difficulty that we make progress. In some places the holes are\r\nso deep that we have to swim, and our little bundles of blankets and\r\nrations are fixed to a raft made of driftwood and pushed before us. Now\r\nand then there is a little flood-plain, on which we can walk, and we\r\ncross and recross the stream and wade along the channel where the water\r\nis so swift as almost to carry us off our feet and we are in danger\r\nevery moment of being swept down, until night comes on. Finding a little\r\npatch of flood-plain, on which there is a huge pile of driftwood and\r\na clump of box-elders, and near by a mammoth stream bursting from the\r\nrocks, we soon have a huge fire. Our clothes are spread to dry; we make\r\na cup of coffee, take out our bread and cheese and dried beef, and enjoy\r\na hearty supper. We estimate that we have traveled eight miles to-day.\r\n\r\nThe canyon here is about 1,200 feet deep. It has been very narrow and\r\nwinding all the way down to this point.\r\n\r\nSeptember 11.--Wading again this morning; sinking in the quicksand,\r\nswimming the deep waters, and making slow and painful progress where the\r\nwaters are swift and the bed of the stream rocky.\r\n\r\nThe canyon is steadily becoming deeper and in many places very\r\nnarrow--only 20 or 30 feet wide below, and in some places no wider, and\r\neven narrower, for hundreds of feet overhead. There are places where\r\nthe river in sweeping by curves has cut far under the rocks, but still\r\npreserves its narrow channel, so that there is an overhanging wall on\r\none side and an inclined wall on the other. In places a few hundred\r\nfeet above, it becomes vertical again, and thus the view to the sky is\r\nentirely closed. Everywhere this deep passage is dark and gloomy and\r\nresounds with the noise of rapid waters. At noon we are in a canyon\r\n2,500 feet deep, and we come to a fall where the walls are broken down\r\nand huge rocks beset the channel, on which we obtain a foothold to reach\r\na level 200 feet below. Here the canyon is again wider, and we find a\r\nflood-plain along which we can walk, now on this, and now on that side\r\nof the stream. Gradually the canyon widens; steep rapids, cascades,\r\nand cataracts are found along the river, but we wade only when it is\r\nnecessary to cross. We make progress with very great labor, having to\r\nclimb over piles of broken rocks.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 295\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we come to a little clearing in the valley and\r\nsee other signs of civilization and by sundown arrive at the Mormon town\r\npowell-canyons-184.jpg\r\n\r\nENTRANCE TO PARU'NUWEAP.\r\n\r\nof Schunesburg; and here we meet the train, and feast on melons and\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\nSeptember 12.--Our course for the last two days, through Paru'nuweap\r\nCanyon, was directly to the west. Another stream comes down from the\r\nnorth and unites just here at Schunesburg with the main branch of the\r\nRio Virgen. We determine to spend a day in the exploration of\r\nthis stream. The Indians call the canyon through which it runs,\r\nMukun'tu-weap, or Straight, Canyon. Entering this, we have to wade\r\nupstream; often the water fills the entire channel and, although we\r\ntravel many\r\n\r\n296\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nmiles, we find no flood-plain, talus, or broken piles of rock at the\r\nfoot of the cliff. The walls have smooth, plain faces and are everywhere\r\nvery regular and vertical for a thousand feet or more, where they seem\r\nto break back in shelving slopes to higher altitudes; and everywhere, as\r\nwe go along, we find springs bursting out at the foot of the walls, and\r\npassing these the river above becomes steadily smaller. The great body\r\nof water which runs below bursts out from beneath this great bed of red\r\nsandstone; as we go up the canyon, it comes to be but a creek, and\r\nthen a brook. On the western wall of the canyon stand some buttes,\r\npowell-canyons-185.jpg\r\n\r\nTOWERS ON THE RIO VIRGEN.\r\n\r\ntowers, and high pinnacled rocks. Going up the canyon, we gain glimpses\r\nof them, here and there. Last summer, after our trip through\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 297\r\n\r\nthe canyons of the Colorado, on our way from the mouth of the Virgen to\r\nSalt Lake City, these were seen as conspicuous landmarks from a distance\r\naway to the southwest of 60 or 70 miles. These tower rocks are known as\r\nthe Temples of the Virgen.\r\n\r\nHaving explored this canyon nearly to its head, we return to\r\nSchunesburg, arriving quite late at night.\r\n\r\nSitting in camp this evening, Chuar'ruumpeak, the chief of the\r\nKai'vavits, who is one of our party, tells us there is a tradition among\r\nthe tribes of this country that many years ago a great light was\r\nseen somewhere in this region by the Paru'shapats, who lived to the\r\nsouthwest, and that they supposed it to be a signal kindled to warn them\r\nof the approach of the Navajos, who lived beyond the Colorado River\r\nto the east. Then other signal fires were kindled on the Pine Valley\r\nMountains, Santa Clara Mountains, and Uinkaret Mountains, so that all\r\nthe tribes of northern Arizona, southern Utah, southern Nevada, and\r\nsouthern California were warned of the approaching danger; but when the\r\nParu'shapats came nearer, they discovered that it was a fire on one of\r\nthe great temples; and then they knew that the fire was not kindled\r\nby men, for no human being could scale the rocks. The\r\nTu'muurrugwait'sigaip, or Rock Rovers, had kindled a fire to deceive the\r\npeople. So, in the Indian language this is called Tu'muurruwait'sigaip\r\nTuweap', or Rock Rovers' Land.\r\n\r\nSeptember 13.--We start very early this morning, for we have a long\r\nday's travel before us. Our way is across the Rio Virgen to the south.\r\nComing to the bank of the stream here, we find a strange metamorphosis.\r\nThe streams we have seen above, running in narrow channels, leaping and\r\nplunging over the rocks, raging and roaring in their course, are here\r\nunited and spread in a thin sheet several hundred yards wide and only\r\na few inches deep, but running over a bed of quicksand. Crossing the\r\nstream, our trail leads up a narrow canyon, not very deep, and then\r\namong the hills of golden, red, and purple shales and marls. Climbing\r\nout of the valley of the Rio Virgen, we pass through a forest of dwarf\r\ncedars and come out at the foot of the Vermilion Cliffs. All day we\r\nfollow this Indian trail toward the east, and at night camp at a great\r\nspring, known to the Indians as Yellow Rock Spring, but to the Mormons\r\nas Pipe Spring; and near by there is a cabin in which some Mormon\r\n\r\n298\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nherders find shelter. Pipe Spring is a point just across the Utah line\r\nin Arizona, and we suppose it to be about 60 miles from the river. Here\r\npowell-canyons-186.jpg\r\n\r\nMUKUN'TUWEAP CANYON.\r\n\r\nthe Mormons design to build a fort another year, as an outpost for\r\nprotection against the Indians. We now discharge a number of the\r\nIndians, but take two with us for\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 299\r\n\r\nthe purpose of showing us the springs, for they are very scarce, very\r\nsmall, and not easily found. Half a dozen are not known in a district\r\nof country large enough to make as many good-sized counties in Illinois.\r\nThere are no running streams, and these springs and water pockets are\r\nour sole dependence.\r\n\r\nStarting, we leave behind a long line of cliffs, many hundred feet\r\nhigh, composed of orange and vermilion sandstones. I have named them\r\n\"Vermilion Cliffs.\" When we are out a few miles, I look back and see\r\nthe morning sun shining in splendor on their painted faces; the salient\r\nangles are on fire, and the retreating angles are buried in shade, and I\r\ngaze on them until my vision dreams and the cliffs appear a long bank of\r\npurple clouds piled from the horizon high into the heavens. At noon we\r\npass along a ledge of chocolate cliffs, and, taking out our sandwiches,\r\nwe make a dinner as we ride along.\r\n\r\nYesterday our Indians discussed for hours the route which we should\r\ntake. There is one way, farther by 10 or 12 miles, with sure water;\r\nanother, shorter, where water is found sometimes; their conclusion was\r\nthat water would be found now; and this is the way we go, yet all day\r\nlong we are anxious about it. To be out two days with only the water\r\nthat can be carried in two small kegs is to have our animals suffer\r\ngreatly. At five o'clock we come to the spot, and there is a huge water\r\npocket containing several barrels. What a relief! Here we camp for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nSeptember 15.--Up at daybreak, for it is a long day's march to the next\r\nwater. They say we must \"run very hard\" to reach it by dark.\r\n\r\nOur course is to the south. From Pipe Spring we can see a mountain, and\r\nI recognize it as the one seen last summer from a cliff overlooking the\r\nGrand Canyon; and I wish to reach the river just behind the mountain.\r\nThere are Indians living in the group, of which it is the highest, whom\r\nI wish to visit on the way. These mountains are of volcanic origin, and\r\nwe soon come to ground that is covered with fragments of lava. The way\r\nbecomes very difficult. We have to cross deep ravines, the heads of\r\ncanyons that run into the Grand Canyon. It is curious now to observe the\r\nknowledge of our Indians. There is not a trail but what they know; every\r\ngulch and every rock seems familiar. I have prided myself on being able\r\nto grasp and retain in my mind the topog-\r\n\r\n300 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nraphy of a country; but these Indians put me to shame. My knowledge is\r\nonly general, embracing the more important features of a region that\r\nremains as a map engraved on my mind; but theirs is particular. They\r\nknow every rock and every ledge, every gulch and canyon, and just where\r\nto wind among these to find a pass; and their knowledge is unerring.\r\nThey cannot describe a country to you, but they can tell you all the\r\nparticulars of a route.\r\n\r\nI have but one pony for the two, and they were to ride \"turn about\"; but\r\nChuar'ruumpeak, the chief, rides, and Shuts, the one-eyed, barelegged,\r\nmerry-faced pigmy, walks, and points the way with a slender cane; then\r\nleaps and bounds by the shortest way, and sits down on a rock and waits\r\ndemurely until we come, always meeting us with a jest, his face a rich\r\nmine of sunny smiles.\r\n\r\nAt dusk we reach the water pocket. It is in a deep gorge on the flank\r\nof this great mountain. During the rainy season the water rolls down the\r\nmountain side, plunging over precipices, and excavates a deep basin in\r\nthe solid rock below. This basin, hidden from the sun, holds water the\r\nyear round.\r\n\r\nSeptember 16.--This morning, while the men are packing the animals, I\r\nclimb a little mountain near camp, to obtain a view of the country. It\r\nis a huge pile of volcanic scoria, loose and light as cinders from a\r\nforge, which give way under my feet, and I climb with great labor; but,\r\nreaching the summit and looking to the southeast, I see once more the\r\nlabyrinth of deep gorges that flank the Grand Canyon; in the multitude,\r\nI cannot determine whether it is itself in view or not. The memories of\r\ngrand and awful months spent in their deep, gloomy solitudes come up,\r\nand I live that life over again for a time.\r\n\r\nI supposed, before starting, that I could get a good view of the great\r\nmountain from this point; but it is like climbing a chair to look at a\r\ncastle. I wish to discover some way by which it can be ascended, as it\r\nis my intention to go to the summit before I return to the settlements.\r\nThere is a cliff near the summit and I do not see any way yet. Now down\r\nI go, sliding on the cinders, making them rattle and clang.\r\n\r\nThe Indians say we are to have a short ride to-day and that we shall\r\nreach an Indian village, situated by a good spring. Our way is across\r\nthe spurs that put out from the great mountain as we pass it to the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n301\r\n\r\nUp and down we go across deep ravines, and the fragments of lava clank\r\nunder our horses' feet; now among cedars, now among pines, and now\r\nacross mountain-side glades. At one o'clock we descend into a lovely\r\nvalley, with a carpet of waving grass; sometimes there is a little water\r\nin the upper end of it, and during some seasons the Indians we wish to\r\nfind are encamped here. Chuar'ruumpeak rides on to find them, and to say\r\nwe are friends, otherwise they would run away or propose to fight us,\r\nshould we come without notice. Soon we see Chuar'ruumpeak riding at full\r\nspeed and hear him shouting at the top of his voice, and away in the\r\ndistance are two Indians scampering up the mountain side. One stops;\r\nthe other still goes on and is soon lost to view. We ride up and find\r\nChuar'ruumpeak talking with the one who had stopped. It is one of\r\nthe ladies resident in these mountain glades; she is evidently\r\npowell-canyons-187.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE WITCHES' WATER POCKET.\r\n\r\n302\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\npaying taxes, Godiva-like. She tells us that her people are at the\r\nspring; that it is only two hours' ride; that her good master has gone\r\non to tell them we are coming; and that she is harvesting seeds.\r\n\r\nWe sit down and eat our luncheon and share our biscuits with the woman\r\nof the mountains; then on we go over a divide between two rounded peaks.\r\nI send the party on to the village and climb the peak on the left,\r\nriding my horse to the upper limit of trees and then tugging up afoot.\r\nFrom this point I can see the Grand Canyon, and I know where I am. I\r\ncan see the Indian village, too, in a grassy valley, em -bosomed in the\r\nmountains, the smoke curling up from their fires; my men are turning out\r\ntheir horses and a group of natives stand around. Down the mountain I go\r\nand reach camp at sunset. After supper we put some cedar boughs on the\r\nfire; the dusky villagers sit around, and we have a smoke and a talk.\r\nI explain the object of my visit, and assure them of my friendly\r\nintentions. Then I ask them about a way down into the canyon. They tell\r\nme that years ago a way was discovered by which parties could go down,\r\nbut that no one has attempted it for a long time; that it is a very\r\ndifficult and very dangerous undertaking to reach the \"Big Water.\"\r\nThen I inquire about the Shi'vwits, a tribe that lives about\r\npowell-canyons-188.jpg\r\n\r\nWUNAVAI GATHERING SEEDS.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AKD THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 303\r\n\r\nthe springs on the mountain sides and canyon cliffs to the southwest.\r\nThey say that their village is now about 30 miles away, and promise to\r\nsend a messenger for them to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\nHaving finished our business for the evening, I ask if there is a\r\ntugwi'nagunt in camp; that is, if there is any one present who\r\nis skilled in relating their mythology. Chuar'ruumpeak says\r\nTomor'rountikai, the chief of these Indians, is a very noted man for his\r\nskill in this matter; but they both object, by saying that the season\r\nfor tugwi'nai has not yet arrived. But I had anticipated this, and soon\r\nsome members of the party come with pipes and tobacco, a large kettle\r\nof coffee, and a tray of biscuits, and, after sundry ceremonies of pipe\r\nlighting and smoking, we all feast, and, warmed up by this, to them,\r\nunusually good living, it is decided that the night shall be spent in\r\nrelating mythology. I ask Tomor'rountikai to tell us about the So'kus\r\nWai'unats, or One-Two Boys, and to this he agrees.\r\n\r\nThe long winter evenings of an Indian camp are usually devoted to the\r\nrelation of mythologic stories, which purport to give a history of an\r\nancient race of animal gods. The stories are usually told by some old\r\nman, assisted by others of the party, who take secondary parts, while\r\nthe members of the tribe gather about and make comments or receive\r\nimpressions from the morals which are enforced by the story-teller, or,\r\nmore properly, story-tellers; for the exercise partakes somewhat of the\r\nnature of a theatrical performance.\r\n\r\nTHE SO'KUS WAI'UNATS.\r\n\r\nTumpwinai'rogwinump, He Who Had A Stone Shirt, killed Sikor', the Crane,\r\nand stole his wife, and seeing that she had a child and thinking it\r\nwould be an incumbrance to them on their travels, he ordered her to kill\r\nit. But the mother, loving the babe, hid it under her dress and carried\r\nit away to its grandmother. And Stone Shirt carried his captured bride\r\nto his own land.\r\n\r\nIn a few years the child grew to be a fine lad, under the care of his\r\ngrandmother, and was her companion wherever she went.\r\n\r\nOne day they were digging flag roots on the margin of the river and\r\nputting them in a heap on the bank. When they had been at work a little\r\nwhile, the boy perceived that the roots came up with greater ease than\r\nwas customary and he asked the old woman the cause of this,\r\n\r\n304 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nbut she did not know; and, as they continued their work, still the reeds\r\ncame up with less effort, at which their wonder increased, until the\r\ngrandmother said,\r\n\r\n\"Surely, some strange thing is about to transpire.\"\r\n\r\nThen the boy went to the heap where they had been placing the roots, and\r\nfound that some one had taken them away, and he ran back, exclaiming,\r\n\r\n\"Grandmother, did you take the roots away?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she answered,\r\n\r\n\"No, my child; perhaps some ghost has taken them off; let us dig no\r\nmore; come away.\"\r\n\r\nBut the boy was not satisfied, as he greatly desired to know what all\r\nthis meant; so he searched about for a time, and at length found a man\r\nsitting under a tree, and taunted him with being a thief, and threw mud\r\nand stones at him until he broke the stranger's leg. The man answered\r\nnot the boy nor resented the injuries he received, but remained silent\r\nand sorrowful; and when his leg was broken he tied it up in sticks and\r\nbathed it in the river and sat down again under the tree and beckoned\r\nthe boy to approach. When the lad came near, the stranger told him he\r\nhad something of great importance to reveal.\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" said he, \"did that old woman ever tell you about your father\r\nand mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the boy; \"I have never heard of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My son, do you see these bones scattered on the ground? Whose bones are\r\nthese?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I know?\" answered the boy. \"It may be that some elk or deer\r\nhas been killed here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the old man.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they are the bones of a bear\"; but the old man shook his head.\r\n\r\nSo the boy mentioned many other animals, but the stranger still shook\r\nhis head, and finally said,\r\n\r\n\"These are the bones of your father; Stone Shirt killed him and left him\r\nto rot here on the ground like a wolf.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the boy was filled with indignation against the slayer of his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThen the stranger asked,\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n305\r\n\r\n\"Is your mother in yonder lodge?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the boy replied.\r\n\r\n\"Does your mother live on the banks of this river?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know my mother; I have never seen her; she is dead,\" answered\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" replied the stranger, \"Stone Shirt, who killed your father,\r\nstole your mother and took her away to the shore of a distant lake, and\r\nthere she is his wife to-day.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the boy wept bitterly and, while the tears filled his eyes so that\r\nhe could not see, the stranger disappeared. Then the boy was filled\r\nwith wonder at what he had seen and heard, and malice grew in his heart\r\nagainst his father's enemy. He returned to the old woman and said,\r\n\r\n\"Grandmother, why have you lied to me about my father and mother?\"\r\n\r\nBut she answered not, for she knew that a ghost had told all to the boy.\r\nAnd the boy fell upon the ground weeping and sobbing, until he fell into\r\na deep sleep, when strange things were told him.\r\n\r\nHis slumber continued three days and three nights and when he awoke he\r\nsaid to his grandmother:\r\n\r\n\"I am going away to enlist all nations in my fight.\"\r\n\r\nAnd straightway he departed.\r\n\r\n(Here the boy's travels are related with many circumstances concerning\r\nthe way he was received by the people, all given in a series\r\nof conversations, very lengthy; so they will be omitted.)\r\npowell-canyons-189.jpg\r\n\r\nTERRACE FIREPLACE AND CHIMNEY OF SHUMOPAVI.\r\n\r\n306\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nFinally he returned in advance of the people whom he had enlisted,\r\nbringing with him Shinau'av, the Wolf, and Togo'av, the Rattlesnake.\r\nWhen the three had eaten food, the boy said to the old woman:\r\n\r\n\"Grandmother, cut me in two!\"\r\n\r\nBut she demurred, saying she did not wish to kill one whom she loved so\r\ndearly.\r\n\r\n\"Cut me in two!\" demanded the boy; and he gave her a stone ax, which he\r\nhad brought from a distant country, and with a manner of great authority\r\nhe again commanded her to cut him in two. So she powell-canyons-190.jpg\r\n\r\nA SWEAT HOUSE.\r\n\r\nstood before him and severed him in twain and fled in terror. And lo!\r\neach part took the form of an entire man, and the one beautiful boy\r\nappeared as two, and they were so much alike no one could tell them\r\napart.\r\n\r\nWhen the people or natives whom the boy had enlisted came pouring into\r\nthe camp, Shinau'av and Togo'av were engaged in telling them of the\r\nwonderful thing that had happened to the boy, and that now there were\r\ntwo; and they all held it to be an augury of a successful expedition to\r\nthe land of Stone Shirt. And they started on their journey.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 307\r\n\r\nNow the boy had been told in the dream of his three days' slumber, of a\r\nmagical cup, and he had brought it home with him from his journey among\r\nthe nations, and the So'kus Wai'unats carried it between them, filled\r\nwith water. Shinau'av walked on their right and Togo'av on their left,\r\nand the nations followed in the order in which they had been enlisted.\r\nThere was a vast number of them, so that when they were stretched out in\r\nline it was one day's journey from the front to the rear of the column.\r\n\r\nWhen they had journeyed two days and were far out on the desert, all the\r\npeople thirsted, for they found no water, and they fell down upon the\r\nsand groaning and murmuring that they had been deceived, and they cursed\r\nthe One-Two.\r\n\r\nBut the So'kus Wai'unats had been told in the wonderful dream of the\r\nsuffering which would be endured, and that the water which they carried\r\nin the cup was to be used only in dire necessity; and the brothers said\r\nto each other:\r\n\r\n\"Now the time has come for us to drink the water.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when one had quaffed of the magical bowl, he found it still full;\r\nand he gave it to the other to drink, and still it was full; and the\r\nOne-Two gave it to the people, and one after another did they all drink,\r\nand still the cup was full to the brim.\r\n\r\nBut Shinau'av was dead, and all the people mourned, for he was a great\r\nman. The brothers held the cup over him and sprinkled him with water,\r\nwhen he arose and said:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you disturb me? I did have a vision of mountain brooks and\r\nmeadows, of cane where honey dew was plenty.\"\r\n\r\nThey gave him the cup and he drank also; but when he had finished there\r\nwas none left. Refreshed and rejoicing, they proceeded on their journey.\r\n\r\nThe next day, being without food, they were hungry, and all were about\r\nto perish; and again they murmured at the brothers and cursed them. But\r\nthe So'kus Wai'unats saw in the distance an antelope, standing on an\r\neminence in the plain, in bold relief against the sky; and Shinau'av\r\nknew it was the wonderful antelope with many eyes which Stone Shirt\r\nkept for his watchman; and he proposed to go and kill it, but Togo'av\r\ndemurred and said:\r\n\r\n308 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\n\"It were better that I should go, for he will see you and run away.\"\r\n\r\nBut the So'kus Wai'unats told Shinau'av to go; and he started in a\r\ndirection away to the left of where the antelope was standing, that he\r\nmight make a long detour about some hills and come upon him from the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nTogo'av went a little way from camp and called to the brothers:\r\n\r\n\"Do you see me!\"\r\n\r\nThey answered they did not.\r\n\r\n\"Hunt for me.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were hunting for him, the Rattlesnake said:\r\n\r\n\"I can see you; you are doing so and so,\" telling them what they were\r\ndoing; but they could not find him.\r\n\r\nThen the Rattlesnake came forth declaring:\r\n\r\n\"Now you know that when I so desire I can see others and I cannot be\r\nseen. Shinau'av cannot kill that antelope, for he has many eyes, and is\r\nthe wonderful watchman of Stone Shirt; but I can kill him, for I can go\r\nwhere he is and he cannot see me.\"\r\n\r\nSo the brothers were convinced and permitted him to go; and Togo'av went\r\nand killed the antelope. When Shinau'av saw it fall, he was very angry,\r\nfor he was extremely proud of his fame as a hunter and anxious to\r\nhave the honor of killing this famous antelope, and he ran up with the\r\nintention of killing Togo'av; but when he drew near and saw the antelope\r\nwas fat and would make a rich feast for the people, his anger was\r\nappeased.\r\n\r\n\"What matters it,\" said he, \"who kills the game, when we can all eat\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nSo all the people were fed in abundance and they proceeded on their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThe next day the people again suffered for water, and the magical cup\r\nwas empty; but the So'kus Wai'unats, having been told in their dream\r\nwhat to do, transformed themselves into doves and flew away to a lake,\r\non the margin of which was the home of Stone Shirt.\r\n\r\nComing near to the shore, they saw two maidens bathing in the water; and\r\nthe birds stood and looked, for the maidens were very beautiful. Then\r\nthey flew into some bushes near by, to have a nearer view, and were\r\ncaught in a snare which the girls had placed for intrusive birds.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n309\r\n\r\nThe beautiful maidens came up and, taking the birds out of the snare,\r\nadmired them very much, for they had never seen such birds before. They\r\ncarried them to their father, Stone Shirt, who said:\r\n\r\n\"My daughters, I very much fear these are spies from my enemies, for\r\nsuch birds do not live in our land.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to throw them into the fire, when the maidens besought\r\nhim, with tears, that he would not destroy their beautiful birds; but\r\nhe yielded to their entreaties with much misgiving. Then they took the\r\nbirds to the shore of the lake and set them free.\r\n\r\nWhen the birds were at liberty once more they flew around among the\r\nbushes until they found the magical cup which they had lost, and taking\r\nit up they carried it out into the middle of the lake and settled\r\ndown upon the water, and the maidens supposed they were drowned.\r\npowell-canyons-191.jpg\r\n\r\nAN INTERIOR LODGE.\r\n\r\nThe birds, when they had filled their cup, rose again and went back to\r\nthe people in the desert, where they arrived just at the right time to\r\nsave them with the cup of water, from which each drank; and yet it was\r\nfull until the last was satisfied, and then not a drop remained.\r\n\r\nThe brothers reported that they had seen Stone Shirt and his daughters.\r\n\r\n310\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO. powell-canyons-192.jpg\r\n\r\nHALVED AND PINNED TRAPDOOR FRAME OF ZUÑI KIVA.\r\n\r\nThe next day they came near to the home of the enemy, and the brothers,\r\nin proper person, went out to reconnoiter. Seeing a woman gleaning\r\nseeds, they drew near, and knew it was their mother, whom Stone Shirt\r\nhad stolen from Sikor', the Crane. They told her they were her sons,\r\nbut she denied it and said she had never had but one son; but the boys\r\nrelated to her their history, with the origin of the two from one, and\r\nshe was convinced. She tried to dissuade them from making war upon Stone\r\nShirt, and told them that no arrow could possibly penetrate his armor,\r\nand that he was a great warrior and had no other delight than in killing\r\nhis enemies, and that his daughters also were furnished with magical\r\nbows and arrows, which they could shoot so fast that the arrows would\r\nfill the air like a cloud, and that it was not necessary for them to\r\ntake aim, for their missiles went where they willed; they thought the\r\narrows to the hearts of their enemies; and thus the maidens could kill\r\nthe whole of the people before a common arrow could be shot by a common\r\nperson. But the boys told her what the spirit had said in the long dream\r\nand that it had promised that Stone Shirt should be killed. They told\r\nher to go down to the lake at dawn, so as not to be endangered by the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the So'kus Wai'unats transformed themselves into mice\r\nand proceeded to the home of Stone Shirt and found the magical bows and\r\narrows that belonged to the maidens, and with their sharp teeth they cut\r\nthe sinew on the backs of the bows and nibbled the bow strings, so that\r\nthey were worthless. Togo'av hid himself under a rock near by.\r\n\r\nWhen dawn came into the sky, Tumpwinai'ro-gwinump, the Stone Shirt man,\r\narose and walked out of his tent, exulting powell-canyons-193.jpg\r\n\r\nWOODEN PIVOT HINGES OF A ZUÑÍ DOOR.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 311\r\n\r\nin his strength and security, and sat down upon the rock under which\r\nTogo'av was hiding; and he, seeing his opportunity, sank his fangs into\r\nthe flesh of the hero. Stone Shirt sprang high into the air and called\r\nto his daughters that they were betrayed and that the enemy was near;\r\nand they seized their magical bows and their quivers filled with magical\r\narrows and hurried to his defense. At the same time, all the nations\r\nwho were surrounding the camp rushed down to battle. But the beautiful\r\nmaidens, finding their weapons were destroyed, waved back their enemies,\r\nas if they would parley; and standing for a few moments over the body\r\nof their slain father, sang the death song and danced the death dance,\r\nwhirling in giddy circles about the dead hero and wailing with despair,\r\nuntil they sank down and expired.\r\n\r\nThe conquerors buried the maidens by the shores of the lake; but\r\nTumpwinai'rogwinump was left to rot and his bones to bleach on the\r\nsands, as he had left Sikor'.\r\n\r\nThere is this proverb among the Utes: \"Do not murmur when you suffer in\r\ndoing what the spirits have commanded, for a cup of water is provided\";\r\nand another: \"What matters it who kills the game, when we can all eat of\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nIt is long after midnight when the performance is ended. The story\r\nitself is interesting, though I had heard it many times before; but\r\nnever, perhaps, under circumstances more effective. Stretched beneath\r\ntall, somber pines; a great camp fire; by the fire, men, old, wrinkled,\r\nand ugly; deformed, blear-eyed, wry-faced women; lithe, stately\r\nyoung men; pretty but simpering maidens, naked children, all intently\r\nlistening, or laughing and talking by turns, their strange faces\r\nand dusky forms lit up with the glare of the pine-knot fire. All the\r\ncircumstances conspired to make it a scene strange and weird. One old\r\nman, the sorcerer or medicine man of the tribe, peculiarly impressed me.\r\nNow and then he would interrupt the play for the purpose of correcting\r\nthe speakers or impressing the moral of the story with a strange\r\ndignity and impressiveness that seemed to pass to the very border of the\r\nludicrous; yet at no time did it make me smile.\r\n\r\nThe story is finished, but there is yet time for an hour or two of\r\nsleep. I take Chuar'ruumpeak to one side for a talk. The three men who\r\nleft us in the canyon last year found their way up the lateral gorge, by\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n312\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthey went into the Shi'wits Mountains, lying west of us, where they met\r\nwith the Indians and camped with them one or two nights and were finally\r\nkilled. I am anxious to learn the circumstances, and as the people of\r\nthe tribe who committed the deed live but a little way from these people\r\nand are intimate with them, I ask Chuar'ruumpeak to make inquiry for me.\r\nThen we go to bed.\r\n\r\nSeptember 17.--Early this morning the Indians come up to our camp.\r\npowell-canyons-194.jpg\r\n\r\nA POULTRY HOUSE OF SICHUMOVI RESEMBLING AN OVEN.\r\n\r\nThey have concluded to send out a young man after the Shi'vwits. The\r\nrunner fixes his moccasins, puts some food in a sack and water in a\r\nlittle wickerwork jug, straps them on his back, and starts at a good\r\nround pace.\r\n\r\nWe have concluded to go down the canyon, hoping to meet the Shi'vwits\r\non our return. Soon we are ready to start, leaving the camp and pack\r\nanimals in charge of the two Indians who came with us. As we move out\r\nour new guide comes up, a blear-eyed, weazen-faced, quiet old man, with\r\nhis bow and arrows in one hand and a small cane in the other. These\r\nIndians all carry canes with a crooked handle, they say to kill\r\nrattlesnakes and to pull rabbits from their holes. The valley is high\r\nup in the mountain and we descend from it by a rocky, precipitous trail,\r\ndown, down, down for two long, weary hours, leading our ponies and\r\nstumbling over the rocks. At last we are at the foot of the mountain,\r\nstanding on a little knoll, from which we can look into a canyon below.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 313\r\n\r\nInto this we descend, and then we follow it for miles, clambering down\r\nand still down. Often we cross beds of lava, that have been poured into\r\nthe canyon by lateral channels, and these angular fragments of basalt\r\nmake the way very rough for the animals.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock the guide halts us with his wand, and, springing over\r\nthe rocks, he is lost in a gulch. In a few minutes he returns, and tells\r\nus there is a little water below in a pocket. It is vile and our ponies\r\nrefuse to drink it. We pass on, still descending. A mile or two from the\r\nwater basin we come to a precipice more than 1,000 feet to the bottom.\r\nThere is a canyon running at a greater depth and at right angles to\r\nthis, into which this enters by the precipice; and this second canyon is\r\na lateral one to the greater one, in the bottom of which we are to find\r\nthe river. Searching about, we find a way by which we can descend along\r\nthe shelves and steps and piles of broken rocks.\r\n\r\nWe start, leading our ponies; a wall upon our left; unknown depths on\r\nour right. At places our way is along shelves so narrow or so sloping\r\nthat I ache with fear lest a pony should make a misstep and knock a man\r\nover the cliffs with him. Now and then we start the loose rocks under\r\nour feet, and over the cliffs they go, thundering down, down, the echoes\r\nrolling through distant canyons. At last we pass along a level shelf for\r\nsome distance, then we turn to the right and zigzag down a steep slope\r\nto the bottom. Now we pass along this lower canyon for two or three\r\nmiles, to where it terminates in the Grand Canyon, as the other ended\r\nin this, only the river is 1,800 feet below us, and it seems at this\r\ndistance to be but a creek. Our withered guide, the human pickle, seats\r\nhimself on a rock and seems wonderfully amused at our discomfiture, for\r\nwe can see no way by which to descend to the river. After some minutes\r\nhe quietly rises and, beckoning us to follow, points out a narrow\r\nsloping shelf on the right, and this is to be our way. It leads along\r\nthe cliff for half a mile to a wider bench beyond, which, he says, is\r\nbroken down on the other side in a great slide, and there we can get to\r\nthe river. So we start out on the shelf; it is so steep we can hardly\r\nstand on it, and to fall or slip is to go--don't look to see!\r\n\r\nIt is soon manifest that we cannot get the ponies along the ledge. The\r\nstorms have washed it down since our guide was here last, years ago. One\r\nof the ponies has gone so far that we cannot turn him back until we\r\n\r\n314\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nfind a wider place, but at last we get him off. With part of the men, I\r\ntake the horses back to the place where there are a few bushes growing\r\nand turn them loose; in the meantime the other men are looking for some\r\nway by which we can get down to the river. When I return, one, Captain\r\nBishop, has found a way and gone down. We pack bread, coffee, sugar, and\r\ntwo or three blankets among us, and set out. It is now nearly dark, and\r\nwe cannot find the way by which the captain powell-canyons-195.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE HUMAN PICKLE.\r\n\r\nwent, and an hour is spent in fruitless search. Two of the men go away\r\naround an amphitheater, more than a fourth of a mile, and start down\r\na broken chasm that faces us who are behind. These walls, that are\r\nvertical, or nearly so, are often cut by chasms, where the showers run\r\ndown,\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 315\r\n\r\nand the top of these chasms will be back a distance from the face of the\r\nwall, and the bed of the chasm will slope down, with here and there a\r\nfall. At other places huge rocks have fallen and block the way. Down\r\nsuch a one the two men start. There is a curious plant growing out from\r\nthe crevices of the rock. A dozen stems will start from one root and\r\ngrow to the length of eight or ten feet and not throw out a branch or\r\ntwig, but these stems are thickly covered with leaves. Now and then the\r\ntwo men come to a bunch of dead stems and make a fire to mark for us\r\ntheir way and progress.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we find such a gulch and start down, but soon come to\r\nthe \"jumping-off place,\" where we can throw a stone and faintly hear it\r\nstrike, away below. We fear that we shall have to stay here, clinging\r\nto the rocks until daylight. Our little Indian gathers a few dry stems,\r\nties them into a bundle, lights one end, and holds it up. The others do\r\nthe same, and with these torches we find a way out of trouble. Helping\r\neach other, holding torches for each other, one clinging to another's\r\nhand until we can get footing, then supporting the other on his\r\nshoulders, thus we make our passage into the depths of the canyon.\r\n\r\nAnd now Captain Bishop has kindled a huge fire of driftwood on the\r\nbank of the river. This and the fires in the gulch opposite and our\r\nown flaming torches light up little patches that make more manifest the\r\nawful darkness below. Still, on we go for an hour or two, and at last\r\nwe see Captain Bishop coming up the gulch with a huge torchlight on his\r\nshoulders. He looks like a fiend, waving brands and lighting the fires\r\nof hell, and the men in the opposite gulch are imps, lighting delusive\r\nfires in inaccessible crevices, over yawning chasms; our own little\r\nIndian is surely the king of wizards, so I think, as I stop for a few\r\nmoments on a rock to rest. At last we meet Captain Bishop, with his\r\nflaming torch, and as he has learned the way he soon pilots us to\r\nthe side of the great Colorado. We are athirst and hungry, almost to\r\nstarvation. Here we lie down on the rocks and drink, just a mouthful or\r\nso, as we dare; then we make a cup of coffee, and spreading our blankets\r\non a sand beach the roaring Colorado lulls us to sleep.\r\n\r\nSeptember 18.--We are in the Grand Canyon, by the side of the Colorado,\r\nmore than 6,000 feet below our camp on the mountain side, which is 18\r\nmiles away; but the miles of horizontal distance represent but\r\n\r\n316 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\na small part of the day's labor before us. It is the mile of altitude\r\nwe must gain that makes it a Herculean task. We are up early; a little\r\nbread and coffee, and we look about us. Our conclusion is that we can\r\nmake this a depot of supplies, should it be necessary; that we can pack\r\nour rations to the point where we left our animals last night, and that\r\nwe can employ Indians to bring them down to the water's edge.\r\n\r\nOn a broad shelf we find the ruins of an old stone house, the walls of\r\nwhich are broken down, and we can see where the ancient people who lived\r\nhere--a race more highly civilized than the present--had made a garden\r\nand used a great spring that comes out of the rocks for irrigation. On\r\nsome rocks near by we discover some curious etchings. Still searching\r\nabout, we find an obscure trail up the canyon wall, marked here and\r\nthere by steps which have been built in the loose rock, elsewhere hewn\r\nstairways, and we find a much easier way to go up than that by which we\r\ncame down in the darkness last night. Coming to the top of the wall, we\r\ncatch our horses and start. Up the canyon our jaded ponies toil and\r\nwe reach the second cliff; up this we go, by easy stages, leading the\r\nanimals. Now we reach the offensive water pocket; our ponies have had\r\nno water for thirty hours, and are eager even for this foul fluid. We\r\ncarefully strain a kettleful for ourselves, then divide what is left\r\nbetween them--two or three gallons for each; but it does not satisfy\r\nthem, and they rage around, refusing to eat the scanty grass. We boil\r\nour kettle of water, and skim it; straining, boiling, and skimming make\r\nit a little better, for it was full of loathsome, wriggling larvae, with\r\nhuge black heads. But plenty of coffee takes away the bad smell, and so\r\nmodifies the taste that most of us can drink, though our little Indian\r\nseems to prefer the original mixture. We reach camp about sunset, and\r\nare glad to rest.\r\n\r\nSeptember 19.--We are tired and sore, and must rest a day with our\r\nIndian neighbors. During the inclement season they live in shelters made\r\nof boughs or the bark of the cedar, which they strip off in long shreds.\r\nIn this climate, most of the year is dry and warm, and during such\r\ntime they do not care for shelter. Clearing a small, circular space of\r\nground, they bank it around with brush and sand, and wallow in it during\r\nthe day and huddle together in a heap at night--men, women,\r\n\r\n317 powell-canyons-196.jpg\r\n\r\nRECENT LAVA FLOW ON THE UINKARET. powell-canyons-197.jpg\r\n\r\nA ZUÑI WINDOW GLAZED WITH SELENITE.\r\n\r\n318 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nand children; buckskin, rags, and sand. They wear very little clothing,\r\nnot needing much in this lovely climate.\r\n\r\nAltogether, these Indians are more nearly in their primitive condition\r\nthan any others on the continent with whom I am acquainted. They have\r\nnever received anything from the government and are too poor to tempt\r\nthe trader, and their country is so nearly inaccessible that the white\r\nman never visits them. The sunny mountain side is covered with: wild\r\nfruits, nuts, and native grains, upon which they subsist. The oose,\r\nthe fruit of the yucca, or Spanish bayonet, is rich, and not unlike the\r\npawpaw of the valley of the Ohio. They eat it raw and also roast it in\r\nthe ashes. They gather the fruits of a cactus plant, which are rich and\r\nluscious, and eat them as grapes or express the juice from them, making\r\nthe dry pulp into cakes and saving them for winter and drinking the wine\r\nabout their camp fires until the midnight is merry with their revelries.\r\n\r\nThey gather the seeds of many plants, as sunflowers, golden-rod, and\r\ngrasses. For this purpose they have large conical baskets, which hold\r\ntwo or more bushels. The women carry them on their backs, suspended from\r\ntheir foreheads by broad straps, and with a smaller one in the left\r\nhand and a willow-woven fan in the right they walk among the grasses and\r\nsweep the seed into the smaller basket, which is emptied now and then\r\ninto the larger, until it is full of seeds and chaff; then they winnow\r\nout the chaff and roast the seeds. They roast these curiously; they put\r\nseeds and a quantity of red-hot coals into a willow tray and, by rapidly\r\nand dexterously shaking and tossing them, keep the coals aglow and the\r\nseeds and tray from burning. So skilled are the crones in this work they\r\nroll the seeds to one side of the tray as they are roasted and the coals\r\nto the other as if by magic.\r\n\r\nThen they grind the seeds into a fine flour and make it into cakes and\r\nmush. It is a merry sight, sometimes, to see the women grinding at the\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n319\r\n\r\nmill. For a mill, they use a large flat rock, lying on the ground, and\r\nanother small cylindrical one in their hands. They sit prone on the\r\nground, hold the large flat rock between the feet and legs, then fill\r\ntheir laps with seeds, making a hopper to the mill with their dusky\r\nlegs, and grind by pushing the seeds across the larger rock, where\r\nthey drop into a tray. I have seen a group of women grinding together,\r\nkeeping time to a chant, or gossiping and chatting, while the younger\r\nlassies would jest and chatter and make the pine woods merry with their\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nMothers carry their babes curiously in baskets. They make a wicker board\r\nby plaiting willows and sew a buckskin cloth to either edge, and this is\r\nfulled in the middle so as to form a sack closed at the bottom. At the\r\ntop they make a wicker shade, like \"my grandmother's sunbonnet,\" and\r\nwrapping the little one in a wild-cat robe, place it in the basket,\r\nand this they carry on their backs, strapped over the forehead, and the\r\nlittle brown midgets are ever peering over their mothers' shoulders. In\r\ncamp, they stand the basket against the trunk of a tree or hang it to a\r\nlimb.\r\n\r\nThere is little game in the country, yet they get a mountain sheep now\r\nand then or a deer, with their arrows, for they are not yet supplied\r\nwith guns. They get many rabbits, sometimes with arrows, sometimes with\r\nnets. They make a net of twine, made of the fibers of a native flax.\r\nSometimes this is made a hundred yards in length, and is placed in\r\na half-circular position, with wings of sage brush. Then they have a\r\ncircle hunt, and drive great numbers of rabbits into the snare, where\r\nthey are shot with arrows. Most of their bows are made of cedar, but the\r\nbest are made of the horns of mountain sheep. These are soaked in water\r\nuntil quite soft, cut into long thin strips, and glued together;\r\nthey are then quite elastic. During the autumn, grasshoppers are very\r\nabundant, can be gathered by the bushel. At such a time, they dig a hole\r\nin the sand, heat stones in a fire near by, put some hot stones in the\r\nbottom of the hole, put on a layer of grasshoppers, then a layer of hot\r\nstones, and continue this, until they put bushels on to roast. There\r\nthey are. powell-canyons-198.jpg\r\n\r\nA ZUÑÍ CHAIR.\r\n\r\nWhen cold weather sets in, these insects are numbed and\r\n\r\n320\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO. powell-canyons-199.jpg\r\n\r\nAN ANCIENT CIRCULAR DOORWAY OR \"STONE CLOSE\" IN KIN-TIEL.\r\n\r\nleft until cool, when they are taken out, thoroughly dried, and ground\r\ninto meal. Grasshopper gruel or grasshopper cake is a great treat.\r\n\r\nTheir lore consists of a mass of traditions, or mythology. It is very\r\ndifficult to induce them to tell it to white men; but the old Spanish\r\npriests, in the days of the conquest of New Mexico, spread among the\r\nIndians of this country many Bible stories, which the Indians are\r\nusually willing to tell. It is not always easy to recognize them; the\r\nIndian mind is a strange receptacle for such stories and they are apt\r\nto sprout new limbs. Maybe much of their added quaint-ness is due to the\r\nway in which they were told by the \"fathers.\" But in a confidential way,\r\nwhile alone, or when admitted to their camp fire on a winter night, one\r\nmay hear the stories of their mythology. I believe that the greatest\r\nmark of friendship or confidence that an Indian can give is to tell you\r\nhis religion. After one has so talked with me I should ever trust him;\r\nand I feel on very good terms with these Indians since our experience of\r\nthe other night.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the watering places and of the trails and passes is\r\nconsidered of great importance and is necessary to give standing to a\r\nchief.\r\n\r\nThis evening, the Shi'vwits, for whom we have sent, come in, and after\r\nsupper we hold a long council. A blazing fire is built, and around\r\nthis we sit--the Indians living here, the Shi'vwits, Jacob Hamblin, and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThis man, Hamblin, speaks their language well and has a great influence\r\nover all the Indians in the region round about. He is a silent, reserved\r\nman, and when he speaks it is in a slow, quiet way that inspires great\r\nawe. His talk is so low that they must listen attentively to hear,\r\nand they sit around him in deathlike silence. When he finishes a\r\npowell-canyons-200.jpg\r\n\r\nA GAMING RING.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 321\r\n\r\nmeasured sentence the chief repeats it and they all give a solemn grunt.\r\nBut, first, I fill my pipe, light it, and take a few whiffs, then pass\r\nit to Hamblin; he smokes, and gives it to the man next, and so it goes\r\naround. When it has passed the chief, he takes out his own pipe, fills\r\nand lights it, and passes it around after mine. I can smoke my own pipe\r\nin turn, but when the Indian pipe comes around, I am nonplused. It has\r\na large stem, which has at some time been broken, and now there is a\r\nbuckskin rag wound around it and tied with sinew, so that the end of the\r\nstem is a huge mouthful, exceedingly repulsive. To gain time, I refill\r\nit, then engage in very earnest conversation, and, all unawares, I pass\r\nit to my neighbor unlighted.\r\n\r\nI tell the Indians that I wish to spend some months in their country\r\nduring the coming year and that I would like them to treat me as a\r\nfriend. I do not wish to trade; do not want their lands. Heretofore I\r\nhave found it very difficult to make the natives understand my object,\r\nbut the gravity of the Mormon missionary helps me much. I tell them that\r\nall the great and good white men are anxious to know very many things,\r\nthat they spend much time in learning, and that the greatest man is\r\nhe who knows the most; that the white men want to know all about the\r\nmountains and the valleys, the rivers and the canyons, the beasts and\r\nbirds and snakes. Then I tell them of many Indian tribes, and where they\r\nlive; of the European nations; of the Chinese, of Africans, and all\r\nthe strange things about them that come to my mind. I tell them of the\r\nocean, of great rivers and high mountains, of strange beasts and birds.\r\nAt last I tell them I wish to learn about their canyons and mountains,\r\nand about themselves, to tell other men at home; and that I want to take\r\npictures of everything and show them to my friends. All this occupies\r\nmuch time, and the matter and manner make a deep impression.\r\n\r\nThen their chief replies: \"Your talk is good, and we believe what you\r\nsay. We believe in Jacob, and look upon you as a father. When you are\r\nhungry, you may have our game. You may gather our sweet fruits. We will\r\ngive you food when you come to our land. We will show you the springs\r\nand you may drink; the water is good. We will be friends and when you\r\ncome we will be glad. We will tell the Indians who live on the other\r\nside of the great river that we have seen Ka'purats, and that he is the\r\nIndians' friend. We will tell them he is Jacob's\r\n\r\n322\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nfriend. We are very poor. Look at our women and children; they are\r\nnaked. We have no horses; we climb the rocks and our feet are sore. We\r\nlive among rocks and they yield little food and many thorns. When the\r\ncold moons come, our children are hungry. We have not much to give; you\r\nmust not think us mean. You are wise; we have heard you tell strange\r\nthings. We are ignorant. Last year we killed three white men. Bad men\r\nsaid they were our enemies. They told great lies. We thought them true.\r\nWo were mad; it made us big fools. We are very sorry. Do not think\r\nof them; it is done; let us be friends. We are ignorant--like little\r\nchildren in understanding compared with you. When we do wrong, do not\r\nyou get mad and be like children too.\r\n\r\n\"When white men kill our people, we kill them. Then they kill more of\r\nus. It is not good. We hear that the white men are a great number.\r\nWhen they stop killing us, there will be no Indian left to\r\npowell-canyons-201.jpg\r\n\r\nINTERIOR VIEW OF A TUSAYAN KIVA.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 323\r\n\r\nbury the dead. We love our country; we know not other lands. We hear\r\nthat other lands are better; we do not know. The pines sing and we are\r\nglad. Our children play in the warm sand; we hear them sing and are\r\nglad. The seeds ripen and we have to eat and we are glad. We do not want\r\ntheir good lands; we want our rocks and the great mountains where our\r\nfathers lived. We are very poor; we are very ignorant; but we are very\r\nhonest. You have horses and many things. You are very wise; you have a\r\ngood heart. We will be friends. Nothing more have I to say.\"\r\n\r\nKa'purats is the name by which I am known among the Utes and Shoshones,\r\nmeaning \"arm off.\" There was much more repetition than I have given, and\r\nmuch emphasis. After this a few presents were given, we shook hands, and\r\nthe council broke up.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamblin fell into conversation with one of the men and held him\r\nuntil the others had left, and then learned more of the particulars of\r\nthe death of the three men. They came upon the Indian village almost\r\nstarved and exhausted with fatigue. They were supplied with food and put\r\non their way to the settlements. Shortly after they had left, an Indian\r\nfrom the east side of the Colorado arrived at their village and told\r\nthem about a number of miners having killed a squaw in drunken brawl,\r\nand no doubt these were the men; no person had ever come down the\r\ncanyon; that was impossible; they were trying to hide their guilt. In\r\nthis way he worked them into a great rage. They followed, surrounded the\r\nmen in ambush, and filled them full of arrows.\r\n\r\nThat night I slept in peace, although these murderers of my men, and\r\ntheir friends, the Uinkarets, were sleeping not 500 yards away. While we\r\nwere gone to the canyon, the pack train and supplies, enough to make an\r\nIndian rich beyond his wildest dreams, were all left in their charge,\r\nand were all safe; not even a lump of sugar was pilfered by the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nSeptember 20.--For several days we have been discussing the relative\r\nmerits of several names for these mountains. The Indians call them\r\nUinkarets, the region of pines, and we adopt the name. The great\r\nmountain we call Mount Trumbull, in honor of the senator. To-day the\r\ntrain starts back to the canyon water pocket, while Captain Bishop and\r\n\r\n324\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nI climb Mount Trumbull. On our way we pass the point that was the last\r\nopening to the volcano.\r\n\r\nIt seems but a few years since the last flood of fire swept the valley.\r\nBetween two rough, conical hills it poured, and ran down the valley to\r\nthe foot of a mountain standing almost at the lower end, then parted,\r\nand ran on either side of the mountain. This last overflow is very\r\nplainly marked; there is soil, with trees and grass, to the very edge\r\npowell-canyons-202.jpg\r\n\r\nCAVE LAKE IN KANAB CANYON.\r\n\r\nof it, on a more ancient bed. The flood was, everywhere on its border,\r\nfrom 10 to 20 feet in height, terminating abruptly and looking like a\r\nwall from below. On cooling, it shattered into fragments, but these are\r\nstill in place and the outlines of streams and waves can be seen. So\r\n\r\nTHE RIO VIRGEN AND THE UINKARET MOUNTAINS. 325\r\n\r\nlittle time has elapsed since it ran down that the elements have not\r\nweathered a soil, and there is scarcely any vegetation on it, but here\r\nand there a lichen is found. And yet, so long ago was it poured from\r\nthe depths, that where ashes and cinders have collected in a few places,\r\nsome huge cedars have grown. Near the crater the frozen waves of black\r\nbasalt are rent with deep fissures, transverse to the direction, of the\r\nflow. Then we ride through a cedar forest up a long ascent, until we\r\ncome to cliffs of columnar basalt. Here we tie our horses and prepare\r\nfor a climb among the columns. Through crevices we work, till at last we\r\nare on the mountain, a thousand acres of pine laud spread out before us,\r\ngently rising to the other edge. There are two peaks on the mountain. We\r\nwalk two miles to the foot of the one looking to be the highest, then\r\na long, hard climb to its summit. What a view is before us! A vision of\r\nglory! Peaks of lava all around below us. The Vermilion Cliffs to the\r\nnorth, with their splendor of colors; the Pine Valley Mountains to the\r\nnorthwest, clothed in mellow, perspective haze; unnamed mountains to\r\nthe southwest, towering over canyons bottomless to my peering gaze,\r\nlike chasms to nadir hell; and away beyond, the San Francisco Mountains,\r\nlifting their black heads into the heavens. We find our way down the\r\nmountain, reaching the trail made by the pack train just at dusk, and\r\nfollow it through the dark until we see the camp fire--a welcome sight.\r\n\r\nTwo days more, and we are at Pipe Spring; one day, and we are at Kanab.\r\nEight miles above the town is a canyon, on either side of which is a\r\ngroup of lakes. Four of these are in caves where the sun never shines.\r\nBy the side of one of these I sit, at my feet the crystal waters, of\r\nwhich I may drink at will.\r\n\r\n326 powell-canyons-203.jpg\r\n\r\nANCIENT POTTERY FROM TUSAYAN.\r\n\r\n327\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nOVER THE RIVER.\r\n\r\nIT IS our intention to explore a route from Kanab to the Colorado River\r\nat the mouth of the Paria, and, if successful in this undertaking, to\r\ncross the river and proceed to Tusayan, and ultimately to Santa Fe, New\r\nMexico. We propose to build a flatboat for the purpose of ferrying over\r\nthe river, and have had the lumber necessary for that purpose hauled\r\nfrom St. George to Kanab. From here to the mouth of the Paria it must be\r\npacked on the backs of mules; Captain Bishop and Mr. Graves are to\r\ntake charge of this work, while with Mr. Hamblin I explore the Kaibab\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\nSeptember 24--To-day we are ready for the start. The mules are packed\r\nand away goes our train of lumber, rations, and camping equipage. The\r\nIndian trail is at the foot of the Vermilion Cliffs. Pushing on to the\r\neast with Mr. Hamblin for a couple of hours in the early morning, we\r\nreach the mouth of a dry canyon, which comes down through the cliffs.\r\nInstead of a narrow canyon we find an open valley from one fourth to one\r\nhalf a mile in width. On rare occasions a stream flows down this valley,\r\nbut now sand dunes stretch across it. On either side there is a wall of\r\nvertical rock of orange sandstone, and here and there at the foot of the\r\nwall are found springs that afford sweet water.\r\n\r\nWe push our way far up the valley to the foot of the Gray Cliffs, and\r\nby a long detour find our way to the summit. Here again we find that\r\nwonderful scenery of naked white rocks carved into great round bosses\r\nand domes. Looking off to the north we can see vermilion and pink\r\ncliffs, crowned with forests, while below us to the south stretch the\r\ndunes and red-lands of the Vermilion Cliff region, and far away we can\r\nsee the opposite wall of the Grand Canyon. In the middle of the\r\n\r\n328 8 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nafternoon we descend into the canyon valley and hurriedly ride, down to\r\nthe mouth of the canyon, then follow the trail of the pack train, for we\r\nare to camp with the party to-night. We find it at the Navajo Well.\r\nAs we approach in the darkness the camp fire is a cheerful sight. The\r\nNavajo Well is a pool in the sand, the sands themselves lying in a\r\nbasin, with naked, smooth rocks all about on which the rains are caught\r\nand by which the sand in the basin is filled with water, and by digging\r\ninto the sand this sweet water is found.\r\n\r\nSeptember 25.--At sunrise Mr. Hamblin and I part from the train once\r\nmore, taking with us Chuar, a chief of the Kaibabits, for a trip to\r\nthe south, for one more view of the Grand Canyon from the summit of the\r\nKaibab Plateau. All day long our way is over red hills, with a bold line\r\nof cliffs on our left. A little after noon we reach a great spring, and\r\nhere we are to camp for the night, for the region beyond us is unknown\r\nand we wish to enter it with a good day before us. The Indian goes out\r\nto hunt a rabbit for supper, and Hamblin and I climb the cliffs. From\r\nan elevation of 1,800 feet above the spring we watch the sun go down and\r\nsee the sheen on the Vermilion Cliffs and red-lands slowly fade into the\r\ngloaming; then we descend to supper.\r\n\r\nSeptember 26.--Early in the morning we pass up a beautiful valley to\r\nthe south and turn westward onto a great promontory, from the summit\r\nof which the Grand Canyon is in view. Its deep gorge can be seen to the\r\nwestward for 50 or 60 miles, and to the southeastward we look off into\r\nthe stupendous chasm, with its marvelous forms and colors.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one years later I read over the notes of that day's experience\r\nand the picture of the Grand Canyon from this point is once more before\r\nme. I did not know when writing the notes that this was the grandest\r\nview that can be obtained of the region from Fremont's Peak to the Gulf\r\nof California, but I did realize that the scene before me was awful,\r\nsublime, and glorious--awful in profound depths, sublime in massive and\r\nstrange forms, and glorious in colors. Years later I visited the same\r\nspot with my friend Thomas Moran. From this world of wonder he selected\r\na section which was the most interesting to him and painted it. That\r\npainting, known as \"The Chasm of the Colorado,\" is in a hall in the\r\nSenate wing of the Capitol of the United States. If any\r\n\r\n329 powell-canyons-204.jpg\r\n\r\nTUSAYAN FETICHES AND IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n330 powell-canyons-205.jpg\r\n\r\nTUSAYAN BASKETRY.\r\n\r\nOVER THE RIVER. 331\r\n\r\none will look upon that picture, and then realize that it was but a\r\nsmall part of the landscape before us on this memorable 26th day of\r\nSeptember, he will understand why I suppress my notes descriptive of\r\nthe scene. The landscape is too vast, too complex, too grand for verbal\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nWe sleep another night by the spring on the summit of the Kaibab, and\r\nnext day we go around to Point Sublime and then push on to the very\r\nverge of the Kaibab, where we can overlook the canyon at the mouth of\r\nthe Little Colorado. The day is a repetition of the glorious day before,\r\nand at night we sleep again at the same spring. In the morning we turn\r\nto the northeast and descend from Kaibab to the back of Marble Canyon\r\nand cross it at the foot of the Vermilion Cliffs, and find our packers\r\ncamped at Jacob's Pool, where a spring bursts from the cliff at the\r\nsummit of a great hill of talus. In the camp we find a score or more\r\nof Indians, who have joined us here by previous appointment, as we need\r\ntheir services in crossing the river.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of September we follow the Vermilion Cliffs around to\r\nthe mouth of the Paria. Here the cliffs present a wall of about 2,000\r\nfeet in height,--above, orange and vermilion, but below, chocolate,\r\npurple, and gray in alternating bands of rainbow brightness. The\r\ncliffs are cut with deep side canyons, and the rainbow hills below are\r\ndestitute of vegetation. At night we camp on the bank of the Colorado\r\nRiver, on the same spot where our boat-party had camped the year before.\r\nLeaving the party in charge of Mr. Graves and Mr. Bishop, while they are\r\nbuilding a ferryboat, I take some Indians to explore the canyon of the\r\nParia. We find steep walls on either side, but a rather broad,\r\nflat plain below, through which the muddy river winds its way over\r\nquicksands. This stream we have to cross from time to time, and we find\r\nthe quicksands treacherous and our horses floundering in the trembling\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nThese broad canyons, or canyon valleys, are carved by the streams in\r\nobedience to an interesting law of corrasion. Where the declivity of the\r\nstream is great the river corrades, or cuts its bottom deeper and still\r\ndeeper, ever forming narrow clefts, but when the stream has cut its\r\nchannel down until the declivity is greatly reduced, it can no longer\r\ncarry the load of sand with which it is fed, but drops\r\n\r\n332 powell-canyons-206.jpg\r\n\r\nDANCE PARAPHERNALIA FROM TUSAYAN.\r\n\r\nOVER THE RIVER. 333\r\n\r\na part of it on the way. Wherever it drops it in this manner a sand bank\r\nis formed. Now the effect of this sand bar is to turn the course of the\r\nriver against the wall or bank, and as it unloads in one place it cuts\r\nin another below and loads itself again; so it unloads itself and forms\r\nbars, and loads itself with more material to form bars, and the process\r\nof vertical cutting is transformed into a process of lateral cutting.\r\nThe rate of cutting is greatly increased thereby, but the wear is on the\r\nsides and not on the bottom. So long as the declivity of the stream\r\nis great, the greater the load of sand carried the greater the rate of\r\nvertical cutting; but when the declivity is reduced, so that part of the\r\nload is thrown down, vertical cutting is changed to lateral and the rate\r\nof corrosion multiplied thereby. Now this broad valley canyon, or \"box\r\ncanyon,\" as such channels are usually called in the country, has been\r\nformed by the stream itself, cutting its channel at first vertically and\r\nafterwards laterally, and so a great flood-plain is formed.\r\n\r\nFor a day we ride up the Paria, and next day return. The party in camp\r\nhave made good progress. The boat is finished and a part of the\r\ncamp freight has been transported across the river. The next day the\r\nremainder is ferried over and the animals are led across, swimming\r\nbehind the ferryboat in pairs. Here a bold bluff more than 1,200 feet in\r\nheight has to be climbed, and the day is spent in getting to its summit.\r\nWe make a dry camp, that is, without water, except that which has been\r\ncarried in canteens by the Indians.\r\n\r\nOctober 4---All day long we pass by the foot of the Echo Cliffs, which\r\nare in fact the continuation of the Vermilion Cliffs. It is still a\r\nlandscape of rocks, with cliffs and pinnacles and towers and buttes on\r\nthe left, and deep chasms running down into the Marble Canyon on the\r\nright. At night we camp at a water pocket, a pool in a great limestone\r\nrock. We still go south for another half day to a cedar ridge; here we\r\nturn westward, climbing the cliffs, which we find to be not the edge\r\nof an escarpment with a plateau above, but a long narrow ridge which\r\ndescends on the eastern side to a level only 500 or 600 feet above the\r\ntrail left below. On the eastern side of the cliff a great homogeneous\r\nsandstone stretches, declining rapidly, and on its sides are carved\r\ninnumerable basins, which are now filled with pure water, and we call\r\nthis the Thousand Wells. We have a long afternoon's\r\n\r\n334\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nride over sand dunes, slowly toiling from mile to mile. We can see a\r\nledge of rocks in the distance, and the Indian with us assures us that\r\nwe shall find water there. At night we come to the cliff, and under it,\r\nin a great cave, we find a lakelet. Sweeter, cooler water never blessed\r\nthe desert.\r\n\r\nWhile at Jacob's Pool, several days before, I sent a runner forward\r\ninto this region with instructions to hunt us up some of\r\npowell-canyons-207.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE THOUSAND WELLS.\r\n\r\nthe natives and bring them to this pool. When we arrive we are\r\ndisappointed in not finding them on hand, but a little later half a\r\ndozen men come in with the Indian messenger. They are surly fellows and\r\nseem to be displeased at our coming. Before midnight they leave. Under\r\nthe circumstances I do not feel that it is safe to linger long at this\r\nspot; so I do not lie down to rest, but walk the camp among the guards\r\nand see that everything is in readiness to move. About two o'clock I\r\nset a couple of men to prepare a hasty lunch, call up all hands, and we\r\nsaddle, pack, eat our lunch, and start off to the southwest to reach\r\n\r\nOVER THE RIVER.\r\n\r\n335\r\n\r\nthe Moenkopi, where there is a little ranchería of Indians, a farming\r\nsettlement belonging to the Oraibis, so we are told. We set out at a\r\nrapid rate, and when daylight comes we are in sight of the canyon of\r\nthe Moenkopi, into which we soon descend; but the ranchería has been\r\nabandoned. Up the Moenkopi we pass several miles, in a beautiful canyon\r\nvalley, until we find a pool in a nook of a cliff, where we feel that we\r\ncan defend ourselves with certainty, and here we camp for the night.\r\nThe next day we go on to Oraibi, one of the pueblos of the Province of\r\nTusayan.\r\n\r\nAt Tusayan we stop for two weeks and visit the seven pueblos on the\r\ncliffs. Oraibi is first reached, then Shumopavi, Shupaulovi, and\r\nMashongnavi, and finally Walpi, Sichumovi, and Hano.\r\n\r\nIn a street of Oraibi our little party is gathered. Soon a council is\r\ncalled by the cacique, or zchief, and we are assigned to a suite of six\r\nor powell-canyons-208.jpg\r\n\r\nTERRACED HOUSES IN ORAIBI, SHOWING ENTRANCE TO KIVA IN FOREGROUND.\r\n\r\n336 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\neight rooms for our quarters. We purchase corn of some of the people,\r\nand after feeding our animals they are intrusted to two Indian boys,\r\nwho, under the direction of the cacique, take them to a distant mesa to\r\nherd. This is my first view of an inhabited pueblo, though I have seen\r\nmany ruins from time to time. At first I am a little disappointed in the\r\npeople. They seem scarcely superior to the Shoshones and Utes, tribes\r\nwith whom I am so well acquainted. Their dress is less picturesque, and\r\nthe men have an ugly fashion of banging their hair in front so that it\r\ncomes down to their eyes and conceals their foreheads. But the women are\r\nmore neatly dressed and arrange their hair in picturesque coils.\r\n\r\nOraibi is a town of several hundred inhabitants. It stands on a mesa\r\nor little plateau 200 or 300 feet above the surrounding plain. The mesa\r\nitself has a rather diversified surface. The streets of the town are\r\nquite irregular, and in a general way run from north to south. The\r\nhouses are constructed to face the east. They are of stone laid in\r\nmortar, and are usually three or four stories high. The second story\r\nstands back upon the first, leaving a terrace over one tier of rooms.\r\nThe third is set back of the second, and the fourth back of the third;\r\nso that their houses are terraced to face the east. These terraces on\r\nthe top are all flat, and the people usually ascend to the first terrace\r\nby a ladder and then by another into the lower rooms. In like manner,\r\nladders or rude stairways are used to reach the upper stories. The\r\nclimate is very warm and the people live on the tops of their houses.\r\nIt seems strange to see little naked children climbing the ladders and\r\nrunning over the house tops like herds of monkeys. After we have looked\r\nabout the town and been gazed upon by the wondering eyes of the men,\r\nwomen, and children, we are at last called to supper. In a large central\r\nroom we gather and the food is placed before us. A stew of goat's flesh\r\nis served in earthen bowls, and each one of us is furnished with a\r\nlittle earthen ladle. The bread is a great novelty to me. It is made of\r\ncorn meal in sheets as thin and large as foolscap paper. In the corner\r\nof the house is a little oven, the top of which is a great flat stone,\r\nand the good housewife bakes her bread in this manner: The corn meal is\r\nmixed to the consistency of a rather thick gruel, and the woman dips her\r\nhand into the mixture and plasters the hot\r\n\r\nOVER THE RIVER.\r\n\r\n337\r\n\r\nstone with a thin coating of the meal paste. In a minute or two it forms\r\ninto a thin paperlike cake, and she takes it up by the edge, folds it\r\nonce, and places it on a basket tray; then another and another sheet of\r\npaper-bread is made in like manner and piled on the tray. I notice that\r\nthe paste stands in a number of different bowls and that she takes from,\r\none bowl and then another in order, and I soon see the effect of this.\r\nThe corn before being ground is assorted by colors, white, yellow, red,\r\nblue, and black, and the sheets of bread, when made, are of the same\r\nvariety of colors, white, yellow, red, blue, and black. This bread,\r\nheld on very beautiful trays, is itself a work of art. They call it\r\npowell-canyons-209.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF TALTI, CHIEF OF THE COUNCIL IN THE TOWN OF OBAIBI.\r\n\r\npiki. After we have partaken of goat stew and bread a course of\r\ndumplings, melons, and peaches is served, and this finishes the feast.\r\nWhat seem to be dumplings are composed of a kind of hash of bread and\r\nmeat, tied up in little balls with cornhusks and served boiling hot.\r\nThey are eaten with much gusto by the party and highly praised. Some\r\ndays after we learned how they are made; they are prepared of goat's\r\nflesh, bread, and turnips, and kneaded by mastication. As we prefer to\r\nmasticate our own food, this dainty dish is never again a favorite.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the people celebrate our advent by a dance, such it\r\nseemed to us, but probably it was one of their regular ceremonies.\r\n\r\n338 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nAfter dark a pretty little fire is built in the chimney corner and I\r\nspend the evening in rehearsing to a group of the leading men the story\r\nof my travels in the canyon country. Of our journey down the canyon in\r\nboats they have already heard, and they listen with great interest to\r\nwhat I say. My talk with them is in the Mexican patois, which several of\r\nthem understand, and all that I say is interpreted.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we are up at daybreak. Soon we hear loud shouts coming\r\nfrom the top of the house. The cacique is calling his people. Then all\r\nthe people, men, women, and children, come out on the tops of their\r\nhouses. Just before sunrise they sprinkle water and meal from beautiful\r\ngrails; then they all stand with bare heads to watch the rising of the\r\nsun. When his full orb is seen, once more they sprinkle the sacred water\r\nand the sacred meal over the tops of the houses. Then the cacique in a\r\nloud voice directs the labor of the day. So his talk is explained to us.\r\nSome must gather corn, others must go for wood, water must be brought\r\nfrom the distant wells, and the animals of the strangers must be cared\r\nfor. Now the house tops present a lively scene. Bowls of water are\r\nbrought; from them the men fill their mouths and with dexterity blow\r\nwater over their hands in spray and wash their faces and lave their long\r\nshining heads of hair; and the women dress one another's locks. With\r\nbowls of water they make suds of the yucca plant, and wash and comb and\r\ndeftly roll their hair, the elder women in great coils at the back of\r\nthe head, the younger women in flat coils on their cheeks. And so the\r\ndays are passed and the weeks go by, and we study the language of the\r\npeople and record many hundreds of their words and observe their habits\r\nand customs and gain some knowledge of their mythology, but above all do\r\nwe become interested in their religious ceremonies.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon they take me from Oraibi to Shupaulovi to witness a great\r\nreligious ceremony. It is the invocation to the gods for rain. We arrive\r\nabout sundown, and are taken into a large subterranean chamber, into\r\nwhich we descend by a ladder. Soon about a dozen Shamans are gathered\r\nwith us, and the ceremony continues from sunset to sunrise. It is a\r\nseries of formal invocations, incantations, and sacrifices, especially\r\nof holy meal and holy water. The leader of the Shamans is a great burly\r\nbald-headed Indian, which is a remarkable\r\n\r\nOVER THE RIVER.\r\n\r\n339 powell-canyons-210.jpg\r\n\r\nPRAYING FOR RAIN.\r\n\r\nsight, for I have never seen one before. Whatever he says or does is\r\nrepeated by three others in turn. The paraphernalia of their worship is\r\nvery interesting. At one end of the chamber is a series of tablets of\r\nwood covered with quaint pictures of animals and of corn, and overhead\r\nare conventional black clouds from which yellow lightnings are\r\nprojected, while drops of rain fall on the corn below. Wooden birds, set\r\non pedestals and decorated with plumes, are arranged in various ways.\r\nEars of corn, vases of holy water, and trays of meal make up a part of\r\nthe paraphernalia of worship. I try to record some of the prayers, but\r\nam not very successful, as it is difficult to hold my interpreter to the\r\nwork. But one of these prayers is something like this:\r\n\r\n\"Muingwa pash lolomai, Master of the Clouds, we eat no stolen bread; our\r\nyoung men ride not the stolen ass; our food is not stolen from\r\n\r\n340\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthe gardens of our neighbors. Muingwa pash lolomai, we beseech of thee\r\nto dip your great sprinkler, made of the feathers of the birds of the\r\nheavens, into the lakes of the skies and sprinkle us with sweet rains,\r\nthat the ground may be prepared in the winter for the corn that grows in\r\nthe summer.\"\r\n\r\nAt one time in the night three women were brought into the kiva. These\r\nwomen had a cincture of cotton about their loins, but were otherwise\r\nnude. One was very old, another of middle age, and the third quite\r\nyoung, perhaps fourteen or fifteen years old. As they stood in a corner\r\nof the kiva their faces and bodies were painted by the bald-headed\r\npriest. For this purpose he filled his mouth with water and pigment\r\nand dexterously blew a fine spray over the faces, necks, shoulders, and\r\nbreasts of the women. Then with his finger as a brush he decorated them\r\nover this groundwork, which was of yellow, with many figures in various\r\ncolors. From that time to daylight the three women remained in the kiva\r\nand took part in the ceremony as choristers and dancing performers.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise we are filed out of the kiva, and a curious sight is\r\npresented to our view. Shupaulovi is built in terraces about a central\r\ncourt, or plaza, and in the plaza about fifty men are drawn up in a line\r\nfacing us. These men are naked except that they wear masks, strange\r\nand grotesque, and great flaring headdresses in many colors.\r\npowell-canyons-211.jpg\r\n\r\nMASHONGNAVI.\r\n\r\n341 powell-canyons-212.jpg\r\n\r\nTUSAYAN TRAYS.\r\n\r\n342 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nOur party from the kiva stand before this line of men, and the\r\nbald-headed priest harangues them in words I cannot understand. Then\r\nacross the other end of the plaza a line of women is formed, facing\r\nthe line of men, and at a signal from the old Shaman the drums and\r\nthe whistles on the terraces, with a great chorus of singers, set up a\r\ntumultuous noise, and with slow shuffling steps the line of men and the\r\nline of women move toward each other in a curious waving dance. When the\r\nlines approach so as to be not more than 10 or 12 feet apart, our party\r\nstill being between them, they all change so as to dance backward to\r\ntheir original positions. This is repeated until the dancers have passed\r\nover the plaza four times. Then there is a wild confusion of dances,\r\nthe order of which I cannot understand,--if indeed there is any system,\r\nexcept that the men and women dance apart. Soon this is over, and the\r\nwomen all file down the ladder into the kiva and the men strip off their\r\nmasks and arrange themselves about the plaza, every one according to his\r\nown wish, but as if in sharp expectancy; then the women return up the\r\nladder from the kiva and climb to the tops of the houses and stand on\r\nthe brink of the nearer terrace. Now the music commences once more,\r\nand the old woman who was painted in the kiva during the night throws\r\nsomething, I cannot tell what, into the midst of the plaza. With a shout\r\nand a scream, every man jumps for it; one seizes it, another takes it\r\naway from him, and then another secures it; and with shouts and screams\r\nthey wrestle and tussle for the charm which the old woman has thrown to\r\nthem. After a while some one gets permanent possession of the charm\r\nand the music ceases. Then another is thrown into the midst. So these\r\ncontests continue at intervals until high noon.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we return to Oraibi. And now for two days we employ our\r\ntime in making a collection of the arts of the people of this town.\r\nFirst, we display to them our stock of goods, composed of knives,\r\nneedles, awls, scissors, paints, dyestuffs, leather, and various\r\nfabrics in gay colors. Then we go around among the people and select the\r\narticles of pottery, stone implements, instruments and utensils made of\r\nbone, horn, shell, articles of clothing and ornament, baskets, trays,\r\nand many other things, and tell the people to bring them the next day to\r\nour rooms. A little after sunrise they come in, and we have a busy day\r\nof\r\n\r\n343 powell-canyons-213.jpg powell-canyons-214.jpg\r\n\r\nTUSAYAN MASKETTES.\r\n\r\n344\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nbarter. When articles are brought in such as I want, I lay them aside.\r\nThen if possible I discover the fancy of the one who brings them, and I\r\nput by the articles the goods which I am willing to give in exchange for\r\nthem. Having thus made an offer, I never deviate from it, but leave it\r\nto the option of the other party to take either his own articles or mine\r\nlying beside them. The barter is carried on with a hearty good will; the\r\npeople jest and laugh with us and with one another; all are pleased,\r\nand there is nothing to mar this day of pleasure. In the afternoon and\r\nevening I make an inventory of our purchases, and the next day is spent\r\nin packing them for shipment. Some of the things are heavy, and I engage\r\nsome Indians to help transport the cargo to Fort Wingate, where we can\r\nget army transportation.\r\n\r\nOctober 24-.--To-day we leave Oraibi. We are ready to start in the early\r\nmorning. The whole town comes to bid us good-by. Before we start they\r\nperform some strange ceremony which I cannot understand, but, with\r\ninvocations to some deity, they sprinkle us, our animals, and our\r\ngoods with water and with meal. Then there is a time of handshaking and\r\nhugging. \"Good-by; good-by; good-by!\" At last we powell-canyons-215.jpg\r\n\r\nSICHUMOVI AND HANO.\r\n\r\nOVER THE RIVER. 345\r\n\r\nstart. Our way is to Walpi, by a heavy trail over a sand plain, among\r\nthe dunes. We arrive a little after noon. Walpi, Sichumovi, and Hano are\r\nthree little towns on one butte, with but little space between them; the\r\nstretch from town to town is hardly large enough for a game of ball.\r\nThe top of the butte is of naked rock, and it rises from 300 to 400 feet\r\nabove the sand plains below by a precipitous cliff on every side. To\r\nreach it from below, it must be climbed by niches and stairways in the\r\nrock. It is a good site for defense. At the foot of the cliff and on\r\nsome terraces the people have built corrals of stone for their asses.\r\nAll the water used in these three towns is derived from a well nearly a\r\nmile away--a deep pit sunk in the sand, over the site of a dune-buried\r\nbrook.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrive the men of Walpi carry our goods, camp equipage, and\r\nsaddles up the stairway and deposit them in a little court. Then they\r\nassign us eight or ten rooms for our quarters. Our animals are once more\r\nconsigned to the care of Indian herders, and after they are fed they are\r\nsent away to a distance of some miles. There is no tree or shrub growing\r\nnear the Walpi mesa. It is miles away to where the stunted cedars are\r\nfound, and the people bring curious little loads of wood on the backs of\r\ntheir donkeys, it being a day's work to bring such a cargo. The people\r\nhave anticipated our coming, and the wood for our use is piled in the\r\nchimney corners. After supper the hours till midnight are passed in\r\nrather formal talk.\r\n\r\nWalpi seems to be a town of about 150 inhabitants, Sichumovi of less\r\nthan 100, and Hano of not more than 75. Hano, or \"Tewa\" as it is\r\nsometimes called, has been built lately; that is, it cannot be more than\r\n100 or 200 years old. The other towns are very old; their foundation\r\ndates back many centuries--so we gather from this talk. The people of\r\nHano also speak a radically distinct language, belonging to another\r\nstock of tribes. They formerly lived on the Rio Grande, but during some\r\nwar they were driven away and were permitted to build their home here.\r\n\r\nTwo days are spent in trading with the people, and we pride ourselves on\r\nhaving made a good ethnologic collection. We are especially interested\r\nin seeing the men and women spin and weave. In their courtyards they\r\nhave deep chambers excavated in the rocks. These chambers,\r\n\r\n346\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nwhich are called kivas, are entered by descending ladders. They are\r\nabout 18 by 24 feet in size. The kiva is the place of worship, where all\r\ntheir ceremonies are performed, where their cult societies meet to pray\r\nfor rain and to prepare medicines and charms against fancied and\r\nreal ailments and to protect themselves by sorcery from the dangers\r\npowell-canyons-216.jpg\r\n\r\nWALPI. A VILLAGE OF TUSAYAN.\r\n\r\nof witchcraft. The kivas are also places for general rendezvous, and\r\nat night the men and women bring their work and chat and laugh, and in\r\ntheir rude way make the time merry. Many of the tribes of North America\r\nhave their cult societies, or \"medicine orders,\" as they are sometimes\r\ncalled, but this institution has been nowhere developed more thoroughly\r\nthan among the pueblo Indians of this region. I am informed that there\r\nare a great number in Tusayan, that a part of their ceremonies are\r\nsecret and another part public, and that the times of ceremony are also\r\ntimes for feasting and athletic sports.\r\n\r\nHere at Walpi the great snake dance is performed. For several days\r\n\r\nOVER THE RIVER. 347\r\n\r\nbefore this festival is held the people with great diligence gather\r\nsnakes from the rocks and sands of the region round about and bring\r\nthem to the kiva of one of their clans in great numbers, by scores and\r\nhundreds. Most of these snakes are quite harmless, but rattlesnakes\r\nabound, and they are also caught, for they play the most important role\r\nin the great snake dance. The medicine men, or priest doctors, are very\r\ndeft in the management of rattlesnakes. When they bring them to the kiva\r\nthey herd all the snakes in a great mass of writhing, hissing, rattling\r\nserpents. For this purpose they have little wands, to the end of each\r\none of which a bunch of feathers is affixed. If a snake attempts to\r\nleave its allotted place in the kiva the medicine man brushes it or\r\ntickles it with the feather-armed wand, and the snake turns again to\r\ncommingle with its fellows. After many strange and rather wearisome\r\nceremonies, with dancing and invocations and ululations, the men of the\r\norder prepare for the great performance with the snakes. Clothed only\r\nin loincloth, each one seizes a snake, and a rattlesnake is preferred if\r\nthere are enough of them for all. It is managed in this way: The snake\r\nis teased with the feather wand and his attention occupied by one man,\r\nwhile another, standing near, at a favorable moment seizes the snake\r\njust, back of the head. Then he puts the snake in his mouth, holding\r\nit across, so that the head protrudes on one side and the body on the\r\nother, which coils about his hand and arm. A few inches of the head and\r\nneck are free, and with this free portion the snake struggles, squirming\r\nin the air; but the attention of the snake is constantly occupied by\r\nthe attendant who carries the wand. Then the men of the priest order\r\ncarrying the snakes in their mouths arrange themselves in a line in the\r\ncourt and move in a procession several times about the court, and then\r\nengage in a dance. After the ceremony all of the snakes are carried to\r\nthe plain and given their freedom.\r\n\r\nThis snake dance was not witnessed at the time of the first visit, but\r\nan account of it was then obtained, such as given above. It has since\r\nbeen witnessed by myself and by others, and carefully prepared accounts\r\nof the ceremonies have been published by different persons.\r\n\r\nAt last our work at Walpi is done, on October 27, and we arrange to\r\nleave on the morrow.\r\n\r\n348 powell-canyons-217.jpg\r\n\r\nTUSAYAN BASKETRY.\r\n\r\n349 powell-canyons-218.jpg\r\n\r\nTUSAYAN BASKETRY.\r\n\r\n350 powell-canyons-219.jpg\r\n\r\nZUÑÍ FROM HOUSETOPS, LOOKING EAST.\r\n\r\n351\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTO ZUÑI.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 28.--To-day we leave the Province of Tusayan for a journey\r\nthrough the Navajo country. There is quite an addition to the party now,\r\nfor we have a number of Indians employed as freighters. Their asses are\r\nloaded with heavy packs of the collections we have made in the various\r\ntowns of Tusayan. After a while we enter a beautiful canyon coming\r\ndown from the east, and by noon reach a spring, where we halt for\r\nrefreshment. The poor little donkeys are thoroughly wearied, but our own\r\nanimals have had a long rest and have been well fed and are all fresh\r\nand active. On the rocks of this canyon picture-writings are etched, and\r\nI try to get some account of them from the Indians, but fail.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch we start once more. It is a halcyon day, and with a\r\ncompanion I leave the train and push on for a view of the country. Away\r\nwe gallop, my Indian companion and I, over the country toward a great\r\nplateau which we can see in the distance. The Salahkai is covered with\r\na beautiful forest. We have an exhilarating ride. When the way becomes\r\nstony and rough we must walk our horses. My Indian, who is well mounted\r\non a beautiful bay, is a famous rider. About his brow a kerchief is\r\ntied, and his long hair rests on his back. He has keen black eyes and\r\na beaked nose; about his neck he wears several dozen strings of\r\nbeads, made of nacre shining shells, and little tablets of turkis are\r\nperforated and strung on sinew cord; in his ears he has silver rings,\r\nand his wrists are covered with silver bracelets. His leggings are\r\nblack velvet, the material for which he has bought from some trader; his\r\nmoccasins are tan-colored and decorated with silver ornaments, and the\r\ntrappings of his horse are decorated in like manner. He carries his\r\nrifle with as much ease as if it were a cane, and rides with wonderful\r\n\r\n352\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\ndexterity. We get on with jargon and sign language pretty well. At\r\nnight, after a long ride, I descend to the foot of the mesa, and near a\r\nlittle lake I find the camp. The donkey train has not arrived, but soon\r\none after another the Indians come in with their packs, and with\r\nwhite men, Oraibi Indians, Walpi Indians, and Navajos, a good party is\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nOctober 29.--We have a long ride before us to-day, for we must reach old\r\nFort Defiance. I stay with the train in order to keep everything moving,\r\nfor we expect to travel late in the night. On the way no water is found,\r\nbut in mid-afternoon the trail leads to the brink of a canyon, and the\r\nIndians tell me there is water below; so the animals are unpacked and\r\ntaken down the cliff in a winding way among the rocks, where they are\r\nsupplied with water. Again we start; night comes on and we are still in\r\nthe forest; the trail is good, yet we make slow progress, for some of\r\nthe animals are weary and we have to wait from time to time for the\r\nstragglers. About ten o'clock we descend from the plateau to the canyon\r\nbeneath and are at old Port Defiance, and the officers at the agency\r\ngive us a hearty greeting. powell-canyons-220.jpg\r\n\r\nNAVAJO INDIAN WITH SILVER ORNAMENTS.\r\n\r\nTO ZUÑI.\r\n\r\n353 powell-canyons-221.jpg\r\n\r\nBRINGING DOWN THE BATTEN.\r\n\r\nWe spend the 30th of October at the agency and see thousands of Indians,\r\nfor they are gathered to receive rations and annuities. It is a wild\r\nspectacle; groups of Indians are gambling, there are several horse\r\nraces, and everywhere there is feasting. At night the revelry is\r\nincreased; great fires are lighted, and groups of Indians are seen\r\nscattered about the plains.\r\n\r\nNovember 1.--After a short day's ride we camp at Rock Spring. A fountain\r\ngushes from the foot of the mesa. Then another day's ride\r\n\r\n354\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthrough a land of beauty. On the left there is a line of cliffs, like\r\nthe Vermilion Cliffs of Utah. In the same red sandstones and on the\r\ntop of the cliff the Kaibab scenery is duplicated. A great tower on the\r\ncliff is known as \"Navajo Church.\" Early in the afternoon we are at\r\nFort Wingate and in civilization once more. The fort is on a beauti-\r\npowell-canyons-222.jpg\r\n\r\nNAVAJO CHURCH, NEAR FORT WINGATE.\r\n\r\nTO ZUÑÍ\r\n\r\n355\r\n\r\nful site at the foot of the Zuñi Plateau. And now our journey with the\r\npack train is ended, and I bid good-by to my Indian friends. My own pack\r\ntrain is to go back to Utah, while from Fort Wingate I expect to go to\r\nSanta Fe in an ambulance. But the region about is of interest for its\r\nwonderful geologic structure and for the many ruins of ancient pueblos\r\nfound in the neighborhood. On the 2d of November Captain Johnson, an\r\nartillery officer, takes me for a ride among the ruins. Many of these\r\nancient structures are found, but those which are of the most interest\r\nare the round towers. Nothing remains of these but the bare walls. They\r\naverage from 18 to 20 feet in diameter, and are usually two or three\r\nstories high. Probably they were built as places of worship.\r\n\r\nAbove Fort Wingate there is a great plateau; below, there stretches a\r\nvast desert plain with mesas and buttes. The ruins are at the foot of\r\nthe plateau where the streams come down from the pine-clad heights.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of November with a party of officers I visit Zuñí in an\r\nambulance. The journey is 40 miles, along the foot of the plateau half\r\nthe way, and then we turn into the desert valley, in the midst of which\r\nruns the Zuñi River, sometimes in canyons cut in black lava. Zuñí is a\r\ntown much like those already visited, except that it is a little larger.\r\nNothing can be more repulsive than the appearance of the streets;\r\nirregular, crowded, and filthy, in which dogs, asses, and Indians are\r\nmingled in confusion. In the distance Toyalone is seen, a great butte\r\non which an extensive ruin is found, the more ancient home of\r\npowell-canyons-223.jpg\r\n\r\nROUND TOWER ON A ROCK.\r\n\r\n356\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthese people, though Zuñi itself appears to be hundreds of years old.\r\nThe people speak a language radically different from that of Tusayan,\r\nand no other tribe in the United States has a tongue related to it.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the town there is an old Spanish church, partly in\r\nruins, but it is still graced with the wooden image of a saint, gayly\r\ncolored; and the old tongueless bell remains, for it was sounded with a\r\nstone hammer held in the hand of the bellman; the marks of his blows are\r\ndeeply indented in the metal. Alvar Nuñez Caveza de Vaca was the first\r\nwhite man to see Zuñi, when he wandered in that long journey from\r\nFlorida around by the headwaters of the Arkansas, through what is now\r\nNew Mexico and Arizona, southward to the City of Mexico. He had with\r\nhim a Barbary negro, who was killed by the Zuñi, and his burial place is\r\nstill pointed out.\r\n\r\nAmong the Zuñi, as among the tribes of Tusayan, the form of government\r\nwhich prevails throughout the North American tribes is well illustrated.\r\nKinship is the tie by which the members of the tribe are bound together\r\nas a common body of people. Each tribe is divided into a series of\r\nclans, and a clan is a group of people that reckon kinship through\r\nthe family line. The children therefore belong to the clan of the\r\npowell-canyons-224.jpg\r\n\r\nTOYALONE, FROM THE TOP OF A HOUSE IN ZUÑÍ.\r\n\r\n357\r\n\r\nTO ZUÑI.\r\n\r\n357 powell-canyons-225.jpg\r\n\r\nTYPICAL TERRACED COMMUNAL PUEBLO.\r\n\r\nmother. Marriage is always without the clan; the husband and father\r\nmust belong to a different clan from the mother and children, and the\r\nchildren belong to their mother and are governed by her brothers, or by\r\nher mother's brothers if they be still living. The husband is but the\r\nguest of the wife and the clan, and has no other authority in the family\r\nthan that acquired by personal character. If he is an able and wise man\r\nhis advice may be taken, but each clan is very jealous of its rights,\r\nand the members do not submit to dictation from the guest husband. The\r\nwoman is1 not the ruler of the clan; the ruler is the patriarch or elder\r\nman, or if he is not a man of ability a younger and more able man\r\nis chosen, who by legal fiction is recognized as the elder. Over the\r\nofficers of the clan are the officers of the tribe,--a chief with\r\nassistant chiefs. The organization by tribal governors varies from tribe\r\nto tribe. Sometimes the chieftaincy is hereditary in a particular\r\nclan, but more often the chieftaincy is elective. There is very little\r\npersonal property among the tribal people, such property being confined\r\nto clothing, ornaments, and a few inconsiderable articles. The ownership\r\nof the great bulk of the property inheres in the clan, such as their\r\n\r\n358\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nhouses, their patches of land, the food raised from the soil, and the\r\ngame caught in the chase. Sometimes the clans are grouped, two or more\r\nconstituting a phratry, and then there are other officers or chiefs\r\nstanding between the clan and tribal authority. Again, tribes are\r\nsometimes organized into confederacies, and a grand confederate chief\r\nrecognized. In addition to the chieftaincy of confederate tribes,\r\nphratries, and clans, there are councils; but these are not councils\r\nof legislation in the ordinary sense. The councils are clans whose\r\ndecisions become a precedent. Tribal law is therefore court-made law,\r\nand such customary law grows out of the exigencies which daily life\r\npresents to the people. The problems as they arise are solved as best\r\nthey may be, and the deliberations of the councils look not to the\r\nfuture but only to the present, and are invoked to settle controversy,\r\nthat peace may be maintained. Of course there is no written constitution\r\nor body of laws, but there are traditional regulations which are well\r\npreserved in the idioms of oral speech, every rule of procedure or of\r\njustice being sooner or later coined into an aphorism.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that a clan is a body of kinship in the female line;\r\nbut the members of the different clans are related to one another by\r\nintermarriage. Thus the first tie is by affinity; but, as fathers belong\r\nto other clans than the children, the tie is also by consanguinity. Thus\r\nthe entire tribe is a body of kindred, and the tribal organization is a\r\nfabric with warp of streams of blood and powell-canyons-226.jpg\r\n\r\nDANCER HOLDING UP THE GREAT PLUMED ARROW.\r\n\r\nTO ZUÑI.\r\n\r\n359\r\n\r\nwoof of marriage ties. When different tribes unite to form a confederacy\r\nfor offensive or defensive purposes, artificial kinship is established.\r\nOne tribe perhaps is recognized as the grandfather tribe, another is\r\nthe father tribe, a third is the elder-brother tribe, a fourth is the\r\nyounger-brother tribe, etc. In these artificial kinships the members\r\nof one tribe address the members of another tribe by kinship terms\r\nestablished in the treaty. Strangers are sometimes adopted into a clan,\r\nand this gives them a status in the tribe. The adoption is usually\r\naccomplished by the woman claiming the individual as her youngest son or\r\ndaughter, and such adopted person has thereupon the status belonging\r\nto such a natural child; and, though he be an adult, he calls the child\r\nborn into the clan before his advent, though it be but a year old, his\r\nelder brother or his elder sister. Then often young men are advanced in\r\nthe clan because of superior ability, and this is done by giving them a\r\nkinship rank higher than that belonging to their real age; so that it\r\nis not infrequently found that old men address young men as their\r\nelder brothers and yield to their authority. The ties of the tribe are\r\nkinship, and authority inheres in superior age; but in order to adjust\r\nthese rules so that the abler men may be given control, artificial\r\nkinship and artificial age are established. The civil chiefs direct the\r\ndaily life of the people in their labors. powell-canyons-227.jpg\r\n\r\nDANCER \"SWALLOWING\" THE GREAT PLUMED ARROW.\r\n\r\n360\r\n\r\nCANYONS OF THE COLORADO. powell-canyons-228.jpg\r\n\r\nNAVAJO WOMAN WEAVING A BELT.\r\n\r\nTo the civil organization of the tribe, as thus indicated, there is\r\nadded a military organization, and war chiefs are selected. But usually\r\nthese war chiefs are something more than war chiefs, for they also\r\nconstitute a constabulary to preserve peace and mete out punishment; and\r\nyoung men from the various clans are designated as warriors\r\n\r\n361\r\n\r\nTO ZUÑI. 361\r\n\r\nand advanced in military rank according to merit.

The Shamans are always found. Among the Zuñi there are thirteen\r\nof these cult societies. The purpose of Shamanistic institutions is to\r\ncontrol the conduct of the members of the tribe in relation to mythic\r\npersonages, the mysterious beings in which the savage men believe. In\r\nthe mind of the savage the world is peopled by a host of mythic beings,\r\nanthropomorphic and zoomorphic. The difference between man and brute\r\nrecognized in civilization, is unrecognized in savagery. All animal\r\nlife is wonderful and magical co sylvan man. Wisdom, cunning, skill,\r\nand prowess are attributed to the real animals to a degree often\r\ngreater than to man; and there are mythic animals as well as mythic\r\nmen--monsters dwelling in the mountains and caves or hiding in the\r\nwaters, who make themselves invisible as they pass over the land. Not\r\nonly are there great monsters, beasts, and reptiles in their mythology,\r\nbut there are wonderful insects and worms. All life is miraculous and\r\nis worshiped as divine. The heavenly bodies, the sun and moon and stars,\r\nare mythic animals, and all of the phenomena of nature are attributed to\r\nthese zoic beings. For example, the Indian knows nothing of the ambient\r\nair. The wind is the breath of some beast, or it is a fanning which\r\nrises from under the wings of a mythic bird. All the phenomena of\r\nnature, the rising and setting of the sun, the waxing and waning of\r\nthe moon, the shining of the stars, the coming of comets, the flash\r\nof meteors, the change of seasons, the gathering and vanishing of the\r\nclouds, the blowing of the winds, the falling of the rain, the spreading\r\nof the snow, and all other phenomena of physical nature, are held to\r\nbe the acts of these wonderful zoic deities. It is deemed of prime\r\nimportance that such deities should be induced to act in the interest\r\nof men. Thus it is that Shamanistic government is held to be of as great\r\nimportance as tribal government, and the Shamans are the peers of the\r\nchiefs. With some tribes the cult socie-\r\n\r\n364 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nties have greater powers than the clan; with other tribes clan\r\ngovernment is the more important; but always there is a conflict of\r\nauthority, and there is a perpetual war between Shamanistic and civil\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThese Shamans and cult societies have a great variety of functions to\r\nperform. All disease and all injuries are attributed to mythic beings or\r\nto witchcraft, and on these pathologic ideas the medicine practices of\r\nthe people are based. The medicine men are sorcerers, who work wonders\r\nin discovering witchcraft and averting its effects or in discovering the\r\ndisease-making animals and overcoming their power. So the Shamans\r\nand the cult societies are the possessors of medicine and ceremonies\r\ndesigned to prevent and cure human ailments. They also have charge of\r\nthe ceremonies necessary to avert disaster and to secure success in all\r\nthe affairs of life in peace and war; and they prescribe methods and\r\nobservances and furnish charms and amulets, and in every way possible\r\ncontrol human conduct in its relation to the unknown. No small part of\r\nsavage life is devoted to cult ceremonies and observances. The hunter\r\ncannot penetrate the forest without his charm; the woman cannot plant\r\ncorn until a ceremony is performed for securing the blessings of some\r\ndivine being. Religious festivals and ceremonies are carried on for days\r\nand weeks. A war must be submitted to the gods, and a sneeze demands a\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nOur arrival at Fort Wingate practically ended the exploration of the\r\ngreat valley of the Colorado. This was in 1870. In 1891 we can look back\r\nupon the completion of the survey of all of that region, for it has now\r\nbeen carefully mapped. The geology of the country has been studied, and\r\nthe tribes which inhabit it have been subjects of careful research.\r\nThis work has been carried on by a large corps of men, and interesting\r\nresults have accrued.\r\n\r\n365 powell-canyons-231.jpg\r\n\r\nASHTISHKEE, A NAVAJO CHIEF.\r\n\r\n366 powell-canyons-232.jpg\r\n\r\nNAVAJO MEDICINE LODGE, VIEWED FROM THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n367 powell-canyons-233.jpg\r\n\r\nNAVAJO MEDICINE LODGE, VIEWED FROM THE EAST.\r\n\r\n368 powell-canyons-234.jpg\r\n\r\nNAVAJO FIRE DANCE.\r\n\r\n369 powell-canyons-235.jpg\r\n\r\nWORKSHOP OF NAVAJO SILVERSMITH.\r\n\r\n370 powell-canyons-236.jpg\r\n\r\nZUÑÍ WOMAN WEAVING A BELT.\r\n\r\n371 powell-canyons-237.jpg\r\n\r\nWEAVING OF DIAMOND-SHAPED DIAGONALS.\r\n\r\n372 powell-canyons-238.jpg\r\n\r\nZUÑI FETICHES.\r\n\r\n373 powell-canyons-239.jpg\r\n\r\nEFFIGY POTTERY FROM ZUÑI.\r\n\r\n374 powell-canyons-240.jpg\r\n\r\nZUÑÍ POTTERY.\r\n\r\n375 powell-canyons-241.jpg\r\n\r\nZUÑÍ GRAILS.\r\n\r\n376 powell-canyons-242.jpg\r\n\r\nCULINARY POTTERY FROM ZUÑI.\r\n\r\n377 powell-canyons-243.jpg\r\n\r\nNAVAJO FABRICS.\r\n\r\n378 powell-canyons-244.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\n379\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\nTHE Grand Canyon is a gorge 217 miles in length, through which flows a\r\ngreat river with many storm-born tributaries. It has a winding way, as\r\nrivers are wont to have. Its banks are vast structures of adamant, piled\r\nup in forms rarely seen in the mountains.\r\n\r\nDown by the river the walls are composed of black gneiss, slates, and\r\nschists, all greatly implicated and traversed by dikes of granite. Let\r\nthis formation be called the black gneiss. It is usually about 800 feet\r\nin thickness.\r\n\r\nThen over the black gneiss are found 800 feet of quartzites, usually in\r\nvery thin beds of many colors, but exceedingly hard, and ringing under\r\nthe hammer like phonolite. These beds are dipping and unconformable with\r\nthe rocks above; while they make but 800 feet of the wall or less,\r\nthey have a geological thickness of 12,000 feet. Set up a row of books\r\naslant; it is 10 inches from the shelf to the top of the line of books,\r\nbut there may be 3 feet of the books measured directly through the\r\nleaves. So these quartzites are aslant, and though of great geologic\r\nthickness, they make but 800 feet of the wall. Your books may have\r\nmany-colored bindings and differ greatly in their contents; so these\r\nquartzites vary greatly from place to place along the wall, and in\r\nmany places they entirely disappear. Let us call this formation the\r\nvariegated quartzite.\r\n\r\nAbove the quartzites there are 500 feet of sandstones. They are of a\r\ngreenish hue, but are mottled with spots of brown and black by iron\r\nstains. They usually stand in a bold cliff, weathered in alcoves. Let\r\nthis formation be called the cliff sandstone.\r\n\r\nAbove the cliff sandstone there are 700 feet of bedded sandstones and\r\nlimestones, which are massive sometimes and sometimes broken into\r\n\r\n380 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nthin strata. These rocks are often weathered in deep alcoves. Let this\r\nformation be called the alcove sandstone.\r\n\r\nOver the alcove sandstone there are 1,600 feet of limestone, in many\r\nplaces a beautiful marble, as in Marble Canyon. As it appears along the\r\nGrand Canyon it is always stained a brilliant red, for immediately\r\nover it there are thin seams of iron, and the storms have painted these\r\nlimestones with pigments from above. Altogether this is the red-wall\r\ngroup. It is chiefly limestone. Let it be called the red wall limestone.\r\n\r\nAbove the red wall there are 800 feet of gray and bright red sandstone,\r\nalternating in beds that look like vast ribbons of landscape. Let it be\r\ncalled the banded sandstone.\r\n\r\nAnd over all, at the top of the wall, is the Aubrey limestone, 1,000\r\nfeet in thickness. This Aubrey has much gypsum in it, great beds of\r\nalabaster that are pure white in comparison with the great body of\r\nlimestone below. In the same limestone there are enormous beds of chert,\r\nagates, and carnelians. This limestone is especially remarkable for its\r\npinnacles and towers. Let it be called the tower limestone.\r\n\r\nNow recapitulate: The black gneiss below, 800 feet in thickness; the\r\nvariegated quartzite, 800 feet in thickness; the cliff sandstone, 500\r\nfeet in thickness; the alcove sandstone, 700 feet in thickness; the red\r\nwall limestone, 1,600 feet in thickness; the banded sandstone, 800 feet\r\nin thickness; the tower limestone, 1,000 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nThese are the elements with which the walls are constructed, from black\r\nbuttress below to alabaster tower above. All of these elements weather\r\nin different forms and are painted in different colors, so that the wall\r\npresents a highly complex facade. A wall of homogeneous granite, like\r\nthat in the Yosemite, is but a naked wall, whether it be 1,000 or 5,000\r\nfeet high. Hundreds and thousands of feet mean nothing to the eye when\r\nthey stand in a meaningless front. A mountain covered by pure snow\r\n10,000 feet high has but little more effect on the imagination than a\r\nmountain of snow 1,000 feet high--it is but more of the same thing;\r\nbut a facade of seven systems of rock has its sublimity multiplied\r\nsevenfold.\r\n\r\nLet the effect of this multiplied facade be more clearly realized. Stand\r\nby the river side at some point where only the black gneiss\r\n\r\n381 powell-canyons-245.jpg\r\n\r\nA GABLE WITH PINNACLES.\r\n\r\n382 powell-canyons-246.jpg\r\n\r\nNICHES OR PANELS THE RED WALL LIMESTONE.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON. 383\r\n\r\nis seen. A precipitous wall of mountain rises over the river, with\r\ncrag and pinnacle and cliff in black and brown, and through it runs an\r\nangular pattern of red and gray dikes of granite. It is but a mountain\r\ncliff which may be repeated in many parts of the world, except that it\r\nis singularly naked of vegetation, and the few plants that find footing\r\nare of strange tropical varieties and are conspicuous because of their\r\ninfrequency.\r\n\r\nNow climb 800 feet and a point of view is reached where the variegated\r\nquartzites are seen. At the summit of the black gneiss a terrace is\r\nfound, and, set back of this terrace, walls of elaborate sculpture\r\nappear, 800 feet in height. This is due to the fact that though the\r\nrocks are exceedingly hard they are in very thin layers or strata, and\r\nthese strata are not horizontal, but stand sometimes on edge, sometimes\r\nhighly inclined, and sometimes gently inclined. In these variegated beds\r\nthere are many deep recesses and sharp salients, everywhere set with\r\ncrags, and the wall is buttressed by a steep talus in many places. In\r\nthe sheen of the midday sun, these rocks, which are besprinkled with\r\nquartz crystals, gleam like walls of diamonds.\r\n\r\nA climb of 800 feet over the variegated beds and the foot of the cliff\r\nsandstone is reached. It is usually olive green, with spots of brown and\r\nblack, and presents 500 feet of vertical wall over the variegated sand-\r\nstone. The dark green is in fine contrast with the variegated beds below\r\nand the red wall above.\r\n\r\nClimb these 500 feet and you stand on the cliff sandstone. A terrace\r\nappears, and sometimes a wall of terraces set with alcoves of marvelous\r\nstructure. Climb to the summit of this alcove sandstone--700 feet--and\r\nyou stand at the foot of the red wall limestone. Sometimes this stands\r\nin two, three, or four Cyclopean steps--a mighty stairway. Oftener the\r\nred wall stands in a vertical cliff 1,600 feet high. It is the\r\nmost conspicuous feature of the grand facade and imparts its chief\r\ncharacteristic. All below is but a foundation for it; all above, but an\r\nentablature and sky-line of gable, tower, pinnacle, and spire. It is\r\nnot a plain, unbroken wall, but is broken into vast amphitheaters, often\r\nmiles abound, between great angular salients. The amphitheaters also are\r\nbroken into great niches that are sometimes vast chambers and sometimes\r\nroyal arches 500 or 1,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\n384 powell-canyons-247.jpg\r\n\r\nBOUNDED INWARD CURVES AND PROJECTING CUSPS OF THE WALLS.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON. 385\r\n\r\nOver the red wall limestone, with its amphitheaters, chambers, niches,\r\nand royal arches--a climb of 1,600 feet--is the banded sandstone, the\r\nentablature over the niched and columned marble, an adamantine molding\r\n800 feet in thickness, stretching along the walls of the canyon through\r\nhundreds of miles. This banded sandstone has massive strata separated\r\nby friable shales. The massive strata are the horizontal elements in\r\nthe entablature, but the intervening shales are carved with a beautiful\r\nfretwork of vertical forms, the sculpture of the rills. The massive\r\nsandstones are white, gray, blue, and purple, but the shales are\r\na brilliant red; thus variously colored bands of massive rock are\r\nseparated by bands of vertically carved shales of a brilliant hue.\r\n\r\nOn these highly colored beds the tower limestone is found, 1,000 feet in\r\nheight. Everywhere this is carved into towers, minarets, and domes, gray\r\nand cold, golden and warm, alabaster and pure, in wonderful variety.\r\n\r\nSuch are the vertical elements of which the Grand Canyon facade is\r\ncomposed. Its horizontal elements must next be considered. The river\r\nmeanders in great curves, which are themselves broken into curves of\r\nsmaller magnitude. The streams that head far back in the plateau on\r\neither side come down in gorges and break the wall into sections. Each\r\nlateral canyon has a secondary system of laterals, and the secondary\r\ncanyons are broken by tertiary canyons; so the crags are forever\r\nbranching, like the limbs of an oak. That which has been described as\r\na wall is such only in its grand effect. In detail it is a series of\r\nstructures separated by a ramification of canyons, each having its\r\nown walls. Thus, in passing down the canyon it seems to be inclosed by\r\nwalls, but oftener by salients--towering structures that stand between\r\ncanyons that run back into the plateau. Sometimes gorges of the second\r\nor third order have met before reaching the brink of the Grand Canyon,\r\nand then great salients are cut off from the wall and stand out as\r\nbuttes--huge pavilions in the architecture of the canyon. The scenic\r\nelements thus described are fused and combined in very different ways.\r\n\r\nWe measured the length of the Grand Canyon by the length of the river\r\nrunning through it, but the running extent of wall cannot be measured in\r\nthis manner. In the black gneiss, which is at the bottom, the wall may\r\nstand above the river for a few hundred yards or a\r\n\r\n386 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nmile or two; then, to follow the foot of the wall, you must pass into a\r\nlateral canyon for a long distance, perhaps miles, and then back again\r\non the other side of the lateral canyon; then along by the river until\r\nanother lateral canyon is reached, which must be headed in the black\r\ngneiss. So, for a dozen miles of river through the gneiss, there may be\r\na hundred miles of wall on either side. Climbing to the summit of the\r\nblack gneiss and following the wall in the variegated quartzite, it is\r\nfound to be stretched out to a still greater length, for it is cut with\r\nmore lateral gorges. In like manner, there is yet greater length of the\r\nmottled, or alcove, sandstone wall; and the red wall is still farther\r\nstretched out in ever branching gorges. To make the distance for ten\r\nmiles along the river by walking along the top of the red wall, it would\r\nbe necessary to travel several hundred miles. The length of the wall\r\nreaches its maximum in the banded sandstone, which is terraced more than\r\nany of the other formations. The tower limestone wall is less tortuous.\r\nTo start at the head of the Grand Canyon on one of the terraces of the\r\nbanded sandstone and follow it to the foot of the Grand Canyon, which by\r\nriver is a distance of 217 miles, it would be necessary to travel many\r\nthousand miles by the winding Way; that is, the banded wall is many\r\nthousand miles in length.\r\n\r\nStand at some point on the brink of the Grand Canyon where you can\r\noverlook the river, and the details of the structure, the vast labyrinth\r\nof gorges of which it is composed, are scarcely noticed; the elements\r\nare lost in the grand effect, and a broad, deep, flaring gorge of many\r\ncolors is seen. But stand down among these gorges and the landscape\r\nseems to be composed of huge vertical elements of wonderful form. Above,\r\nit is an open, sunny gorge; below, it is deep and gloomy. Above, it is a\r\nchasm; below, it is a stairway from gloom to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe traveler in the region of mountains sees vast masses piled up in\r\ngentle declivities to the clouds. To see mountains in this way is to\r\nappreciate the masses of which they are composed. But the climber among\r\nthe glaciers sees the elements of which this mass is composed,--that it\r\nis made of cliffs and towers and pinnacles, with intervening gorges, and\r\nthe smooth billows of granite seen from afar are transformed into cliffs\r\nand caves and towers and minarets. These two aspects of mountain scenery\r\nhave been seized by painters, and in their art\r\n\r\n387 powell-canyons-248.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE EASTERN TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n388 powell-canyons-249.jpg\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON. 389\r\n\r\ntwo classes of mountains are represented: mountains with towering forms\r\nthat seem ready to topple in the first storm, and mountains in masses\r\nthat seem to frown defiance at the tempests. Both classes have told the\r\ntruth. The two aspects are sometimes caught by our painters severally;\r\nsometimes they are combined. Church paints a mountain like a kingdom\r\nof glory. Bierstadt paints a mountain cliff where an eagle is lost\r\nfrom sight ere he reaches the summit. Thomas Moran marries these great\r\ncharacteristics, and in his infinite masses cliffs of immeasurable\r\nheight are seen.\r\n\r\nThus the elements of the facade of the Grand Canyon change vertically\r\nand horizontally. The details of structure can be seen only at close\r\nview, but grand effects of structure can be witnessed in great panoramic\r\nscenes. Seen in detail, gorges and precipices appear; seen at a\r\ndistance, in comprehensive views, vast massive structures are presented.\r\nThe traveler on the brink looks from afar and is overwhelmed with the\r\nsublimity of massive forms; the traveler among the gorges stands in the\r\npresence of awful mysteries, profound, solemn, and gloomy.\r\n\r\nFor 8 or 10 miles below the mouth of the Little Colorado, the river\r\nis in the variegated quartzites, and a wonderful fretwork of forms and\r\ncolors, peculiar to this rock, stretches back for miles to a labyrinth\r\nof the red wall cliff; then below, the black gneiss is entered and soon\r\nhas reached an altitude of 800 feet and sometimes more than 1,000 feet;\r\nand upon this black gneiss all the other structures in their wonderful\r\ncolors are lifted. These continue for about 70 miles, when the black\r\ngneiss below is lost, for the walls are dropped down by the West Kaibab\r\nFault, and the river flows in the quartzites.\r\n\r\nThen for 80 miles the mottled, or alcove, sandstones are found in the\r\nriver bed. The course of the canyon is a little south of west and is\r\ncomparatively straight. At the top of the red wall limestone there is\r\na broad terrace, two or three miles in width, composed of hills of\r\nwonderful forms carved in the banded beds, and back of this is seen a\r\ncliff in the tower limestone. Along the lower course of this stretch the\r\nwhole character of the canyon is changed by another set of complicating\r\nconditions. We have now reached a region of volcanic activity. After the\r\ncanyons were cut nearly to their present depth,\r\n\r\n390 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nlavas poured out and volcanoes were built on the walls of the canyon,\r\nbut not in the canyon itself, though at places rivers of molten rock\r\nrolled down the walls into the Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe next 80 miles of the canyon is a compound of that found where the\r\nriver is in the black gneiss and that found where the dead volcanoes\r\nstand on the brink of the wall. In the first stretch, where the gneiss\r\nis at the foundation, we have a great bend to the south, and in the last\r\nstretch, where the gneiss is below and the dead volcanoes above, another\r\ngreat southern detour is found. These two great beds are separated by 80\r\nmiles of comparatively straight river. Let us call this first great bend\r\nthe Kaibab reach of the canyon, and the straight part the Kanab reach,\r\nfor the Kanab Creek heads far off in the plateau to the north and joins\r\nthe Colorado at the beginning of the middle stretch. The third great\r\nsouthern bend is the Shiwits stretch. Thus there are three distinct\r\nportions of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado: the Kaibab section,\r\ncharacterized more by its buttes and salients; the Kanab section,\r\ncharacterized by its comparatively straight walls with volcanoes on the\r\nbrink; and the Shiwits section, which is broken into great terraces with\r\ngneiss at the bottom and volcanoes at the top.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon of the Colorado is a canyon composed of many canyons.\r\nIt is a composite of thousands, of tens of thousands, of gorges. In\r\nlike manner, each wall of the canyon is a composite structure, a wall\r\ncomposed of many walls, but never a repetition. Every one of these\r\nalmost innumerable gorges is a world of beauty in itself. In the Grand\r\nCanyon there are thousands of gorges like that below Niagara Palls, and\r\nthere are a thousand Yosemites. Yet all these canyons unite to form\r\none grand canyon, the most sublime spectacle on the earth. Pluck up Mt.\r\nWashington by the roots to the level of the sea and drop it headfirst\r\ninto the Grand Canyon, and the dam will not force its waters over the\r\nwalls. Pluck up the Blue Ridge and hurl it into the Grand Canyon, and it\r\nwill not fill it.\r\n\r\nThe carving of the Grand Canyon is the work of rains and rivers. The\r\nvast labyrinth of canyon by which the plateau region drained by the\r\nColorado is dissected is also the work of waters. Every river has\r\nexcavated its own gorge and every creek has excavated its gorge. When\r\n\r\n391 powell-canyons-250.jpg\r\n\r\nGRANITE FALLS, KIABAB DIVISION, GRAND CANYON.\r\n\r\n392 powell-canyons-251.jpg\r\n\r\nDIKES IN THE CANYON WALL.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON. 393\r\n\r\na shower comes in this land, the rills carve canyons--but a little at\r\neach storm; and though storms are far apart and the heavens above are\r\ncloudless for most of the days of the year, still, years are plenty in\r\nthe ages, and an intermittent rill called to life by a shower can do\r\nmuch work in centuries of centuries.\r\n\r\nThe erosion represented in the canyons, although vast, is but a small\r\npart of the great erosion of the region, for between the cliffs blocks\r\nhave been carried away far superior in magnitude to those necessary to\r\nfill the canyons. Probably there is no portion of the whole region from\r\nwhich there have not been more than a thousand feet degraded, and there\r\nare districts from which more than 30,000 feet of rock have been carried\r\naway. Altogether, there is a district of country more than 200,000\r\nsquare miles in extent from which on the average more than 6,000 feet\r\nhave been eroded. Consider a rock 200,000 square miles in extent and a\r\nmile in thickness, against which the clouds have hurled their storms and\r\nbeat it into sands and the rills have carried the sands into the creeks\r\nand the creeks have carried them into the rivers and the Colorado has\r\ncarried them into the sea. We think of the mountains as forming clouds\r\nabout their brows, but the clouds have formed the mountains. Great\r\ncontinental blocks are upheaved from beneath the sea by internal\r\ngeologic forces that fashion the earth. Then the wandering clouds, the\r\ntempest-bearing clouds, the rainbow-decked clouds, with mighty power and\r\nwith wonderful skill, carve out valleys and canyons and fashion hills\r\nand cliffs and mountains. The clouds are the artists sublime.\r\n\r\nIn winter some of the characteristics of the Grand Canyon are\r\nemphasized. The black gneiss below, the variegated quartzite, and the\r\ngreen or alcove sandstone form the foundation for the mighty red wall.\r\nThe banded sandstone entablature is crowned by the tower limestone.\r\nIn winter this is covered with snow. Seen from below, these changing\r\nelements seem to graduate into the heavens, and no plane of demarcation\r\nbetween wall and blue firmament can be seen. The heavens constitute\r\na portion of the facade and mount into a vast dome from wall to wall,\r\nspanning the Grand Canyon with empyrean blue. So the earth and the\r\nheavens are blended in one vast structure.\r\n\r\nWhen the clouds play in the canyon, as they often do in the rainy\r\nseason, another set of effects is produced. Clouds creep out of canyons\r\n\r\n394 CANYONS OF THE COLORADO.\r\n\r\nand wind into other canyons. The heavens seem to be alive, not moving\r\nas move the heavens over a plain, in one direction with the wind, but\r\nfollowing the multiplied courses of these gorges. In this manner the\r\nlittle clouds seem to be individualized, to have wills and souls of\r\ntheir own, and to be going on diverse errands--a vast assemblage of\r\nself-willed clouds, faring here and there, intent upon purposes hidden\r\nin their own breasts. In the imagination the clouds belong to the sky,\r\nand when they are in the canyon the skies come down into the gorges and\r\ncling to the cliffs and lift them up to immeasurable heights, for the\r\nsky must still be far away. Thus they lend infinity to the walls.\r\n\r\nThe wonders of the Grand Canyon cannot be adequately represented in\r\nsymbols of speech, nor by speech itself. The resources of the graphic\r\nart are taxed beyond their powers in attempting to portray its features.\r\nLanguage and illustration combined must fail. The elements that unite\r\nto make the Grand Canyon the most sublime spectacle in nature are\r\nmultifarious and exceedingly diverse. The Cyclopean forms which result\r\nfrom the sculpture of tempests through ages too long for man to compute,\r\nare wrought into endless details, to describe which would be a task\r\nequal in magnitude to that of describing the stars of the heavens or\r\nthe multitudinous beauties of the forest with its traceries of foliage\r\npresented by oak and pine and poplar, by beech and linden and hawthorn,\r\nby tulip and lily and rose, by fern and moss and lichen. Besides the\r\nelements of form, there are elements of color, for here the colors of\r\nthe heavens are rivaled by the colors of the rocks. The rainbow is not\r\nmore replete with hues. But form and color do not exhaust all the\r\ndivine qualities of the Grand Canyon. It is the land of music. The river\r\nthunders in perpetual roar, swelling in floods of music when the storm\r\ngods play upon the rocks and fading away in soft and low murmurs when\r\nthe infinite blue of heaven is unveiled. With the melody of the great\r\ntide rising and falling, swelling and vanishing forever, other melodies\r\nare heard in the gorges of the lateral canyons, while the waters plunge\r\nin the rapids among the rocks or leap in great cataracts. Thus the Grand\r\nCanyon, is a land of song. Mountains of music swell in the rivers, hills\r\nof music billow in the creeks, and meadows of music murmur in the rills\r\nthat ripple over the rocks. Altogether it is a symphony of multitudinous\r\nmelodies. All this is the music of waters.

But more: it is a vast\r\ndistrict of country. Were it a valley plain it would make a state. It\r\ncan be seen only in parts from hour to hour and from day to day and from\r\nweek to week and from month to month. A year scarcely suffices to see\r\nit all. It has infinite variety, and no part is ever duplicated.\r\nIts colors, though many and complex at any instant, change with the\r\nascending and declining sun; lights and shadows appear and vanish with\r\nthe passing clouds, and the changing seasons mark their passage in\r\nchanging colors. You cannot see the Grand Canyon in one view, as if it\r\nwere a changeless spectacle from which a curtain might be lifted, but to\r\nsee it you have to toil from month to month through its labyrinths. It\r\nis a region more difficult to traverse than the Alps or the Himalayas,\r\nbut if strength and courage are sufficient for the task, by a year's\r\ntoil a concept of sublimity can be obtained never again to be equaled on\r\nthe hither side of Paradise.\r\n\r\n399\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\nPAGE\r\n\r\nApache Indians, home and character of the ....24\r\n\r\nArt, ancient, vestiges of, in the Gila and Colorado valleys .24\r\n\r\nBad lands, formation and characteristics of the ....68,71\r\n\r\nBad lands of Green River ........124\r\n\r\nBaker, John, a famous mountaineer ......131\r\n\r\nBierstadt, how he paints a mountain ......389\r\n\r\nBoats and cargoes, description of ......119\r\n\r\nBosque Redondo, Navajos on a reservation at the ...52\r\n\r\nBradley, G.
