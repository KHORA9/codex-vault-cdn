Such a contention of course required to be dealt\r\nwith, and led me to collect information bearing upon temperature in all\r\nits aspects, and so enlarging my criticism that I saw it would be\r\nnecessary to issue it in book form.\r\n\r\nTwo of my mathematical friends have pointed out the chief omission which\r\nvitiates Professor Lowell's mathematical conclusions--that of a failure\r\nto recognise the very large conservative and _cumulative_ effect of a\r\ndense atmosphere. This very point however I had already myself discussed\r\nin Chapter VI., and by means of some remarkable researches on the heat\r\nof the moon and an investigation of the causes of its very low\r\ntemperature, I have, I think, demonstrated the incorrectness of Mr.\r\nLowell's results. In my last chapter, in which I briefly summarise the\r\nwhole argument, I have further strengthened the case for very severe\r\ncold in Mars, by adducing the rapid lowering of temperature universally\r\ncaused by diminution of atmospheric pressure, as manifested in the\r\nwell-known phenomenon of temperate climates at moderate heights even\r\nclose to the equator, cold climates at greater heights even on extensive\r\nplateaux, culminating in arctic climates and perpetual snow at heights\r\nwhere the air is still far denser than it is on the surface of Mars.\r\nThis argument itself is, in my opinion, conclusive; but it is enforced\r\nby two others equally complete, neither of which is adequately met by\r\nMr. Lowell.\r\n\r\nThe careful examination which I have been led to give to the whole of\r\nthe phenomena which Mars presents, and especially to the discoveries of\r\nMr. Lowell, has led me to what I hope will be considered a satisfactory\r\nphysical explanation of them. This explanation, which occupies the whole\r\nof my seventh chapter, is founded upon a special mode of origin for\r\nMars, derived from the Meteoritic Hypothesis, now very widely adopted by\r\nastronomers and physicists. Then, by a comparison with certain\r\nwell-known and widely spread geological phenomena, I show how the great\r\nfeatures of Mars--the 'canals' and 'oases'--may have been caused. This\r\nchapter will perhaps be the most interesting to the general reader, as\r\nfurnishing a quite natural explanation of features of the planet which\r\nhave been termed 'non-natural' by Mr. Lowell.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, also, I have been led to an explanation of the highly\r\nvolcanic nature of the moon's surface. This seems to me absolutely to\r\nrequire some such origin as Sir George Darwin has given it, and thus\r\nfurnishes corroborative proof of the accuracy of the hypothesis that our\r\nmoon has had an unique origin among the known satellites, in having been\r\nthrown off from the earth itself.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Professor J. H. Poynting, of the University of\r\nBirmingham, for valuable suggestions on some of the more difficult\r\npoints of mathematical physics here discussed, and also for the critical\r\nnote (at the end of Chapter V.) on Professor Lowell's estimate of the\r\ntemperature of Mars.\r\n\r\nBROADSTONE, DORSET, _October_ 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nEARLY OBSERVERS OF MARS,\r\n--Mars the only planet the surface of which is\r\n  distinctly visible\r\n--Early observation of the snow-caps and seas\r\n--The 'canals' seen by Schiaparelli in 1877\r\n--Double canals first seen in 1881\r\n--Round spots at intersection of canals seen\r\n  by Pickering in 1892\r\n--Confirmed by Lowell in 1894\r\n--Changes of colour seen in 1892 and 1894\r\n--Existence of seas doubted by Pickering and\r\n  Barnard in 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMR.

Of Venus we probably see only the upper surface of\r\nits cloudy atmosphere.[1] As regards Jupiter and Saturn this is still\r\nmore certain, since their low density will only permit of a\r\ncomparatively small proportion of their huge bulk being solid. Their\r\nbelts are but the cloud-strata of their upper atmosphere, perhaps\r\nthousands of miles above their solid surfaces, and a somewhat similar\r\ncondition seems to prevail in the far more remote planets Uranus and\r\nNeptune. It has thus happened, that, although as telescopic objects of\r\ninterest and beauty, the marvellous rings of Saturn, the belts and\r\never-changing aspects of the satellites of Jupiter, and the moon-like\r\nphases of Venus, together with its extreme brilliancy, still remain\r\nunsurpassed, yet the greater amount of details of these features when\r\nexamined with the powerful instruments of the nineteenth century have\r\nneither added much to our knowledge of the planets themselves or led to\r\nany sensational theories calculated to attract the popular imagination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mercury also seems to have a scanty atmosphere, but as its\r\nmass is only one-thirtieth that of the earth it can retain only the\r\nheavier gases, and its atmosphere may be dust-laden, as is that of Mars,\r\naccording to Mr. Lowell. Its dusky markings, as seen by Schiaparelli,\r\nseem to be permanent, and they are also for considerable periods\r\nunchangeable in position, indicating that the planet keeps the same face\r\ntowards the sun as does Venus. This was confirmed by Mr. Lowell in 1896.\r\nIts distance from us and unfavourable position for observation must\r\nprevent us from obtaining any detailed knowledge of its actual surface,\r\nthough its low reflective power indicates that the surface may be really\r\nvisible.]\r\n\r\nBut in the case of Mars the progress of discovery has had a very\r\ndifferent result. The most obvious peculiarity of this planet--its polar\r\nsnow-caps--were seen about 250 years ago, but they were first proved to\r\nincrease and decrease alternately, in the summer and winter of each\r\nhemisphere, by Sir William Herschell in the latter part of the\r\neighteenth century. This fact gave the impulse to that idea of\r\nsimilarity in the conditions of Mars and the earth, which the\r\nrecognition of many large dusky patches and streaks as water, and the\r\nmore ruddy and brighter portions as land, further increased. Added to\r\nthis, a day only about half an hour longer than our own, and a\r\nsuccession of seasons of the same character as ours but of nearly double\r\nthe length owing to its much longer year, seemed to leave little wanting\r\nto render this planet a true earth on a smaller scale. It was therefore\r\nvery natural to suppose that it must be inhabited, and that we should\r\nsome day obtain evidence of the fact.\r\n\r\n_The Canals discovered by Schiaparelli._\r\n\r\nHence the great interest excited when Schiaparelli, at the Milan\r\nObservatory, during the very favourable opposition of 1877 and 1879,\r\nobserved that the whole of the tropical and temperate regions from 60°\r\nN. to 60° S. Lat. were covered with a remarkable network of broader\r\ncurved and narrower straight lines of a dark colour. At each successive\r\nfavourable opposition, these strange objects called _canali_ (channels)\r\nby their discoverer, but rather misleadingly 'canals' in England and\r\nAmerica, were observed by means of all the great telescopes in the\r\nworld, and their reality and general features became well established.\r\nIn Schiaparelli's first map they were represented as being much broader\r\nand less sharply defined than he himself and other observers found by\r\nlater and equally favourable observations that they really were.\r\n\r\n_Discovery of the Double Canals._\r\n\r\nIn 1881 another strange feature was discovered by Schiaparelli, who\r\nfound that about twenty canals which had previously been seen single\r\nwere now distinctly double, that is, that they consisted of two parallel\r\nlines, equally distinct and either very close together or a considerable\r\ndistance apart. This curious appearance was at first thought to be due\r\nto some instrumental defect or optical illusion; but as it was soon\r\nconfirmed by other observers with the best instruments and in widely\r\ndifferent localities it became in time accepted as a real phenomenon of\r\nthe planet's surface.\r\n\r\n_Round Spots discovered in_ 1892.\r\n\r\nAt the favourable opposition of 1892, Mr. W. H. Pickering noticed that\r\nbesides the 'seas' of various sizes there were numerous very small black\r\nspots apparently quite circular and occurring at every intersection or\r\nstarting-point of the 'canals.' Many of these had been seen by\r\nSchiaparelli as larger and ill-defined dark patches, and were termed\r\nseas or lakes; but Mr. Pickering's observatory was at Arequipa in Peru,\r\nabout 8000 feet above the sea, and with such perfect atmospheric\r\nconditions as were, in his opinion, equal to a doubling of telescopic\r\naperture. They were soon detected by other observers, especially by Mr.\r\nLowell in 1894, who thus wrote of them:\r\n\r\n\"Scattered over the orange-ochre groundwork of the continental regions\r\nof the planet, are any number of dark round spots. How many there may be\r\nit is not possible to state, as the better the seeing, the more of them\r\nthere seem to be. In spite, however, of their great number, there is no\r\ninstance of one unconnected with a canal. What is more, there is\r\napparently none that does not lie at the junction of several canals.\r\nReversely, all the junctions appear to be provided with spots. Plotted\r\nupon a globe they and their connecting canals make a most curious\r\nnetwork over all the orange-ochre equatorial parts of the planet, a mass\r\nof lines and knots, the one marking being as omnipresent as the other.\"\r\n\r\n_Changes of Colour recognised._\r\n\r\nDuring the oppositions of 1892 and 1894 it was fully recognised that a\r\nregular course of change occurred dependent upon the succession of the\r\nseasons, as had been first suggested by Schiaparelli. As the polar snows\r\nmelt the adjacent seas appear to overflow and spread out as far as the\r\ntropics, and are often seen to assume a distinctly green colour. These\r\nremarkable changes and the extraordinary phenomena of perfect straight\r\nlines crossing each other over a large portion of the planet's surface,\r\nwith the circular spots at their intersections, had such an appearance\r\nof artificiality that the idea that they were really 'canals' made by\r\nintelligent beings for purposes of irrigation, was first hinted at, and\r\nthen adopted as the only intelligible explanation, by Mr. Lowell and a\r\nfew other persons. This at once seized upon the public imagination and\r\nwas spread by the newspapers and magazines over the whole civilised\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n_Existence of Seas doubted._\r\n\r\nAt this time (1894) it began to be doubted whether there were any seas\r\nat all on Mars. Professor Pickering thought they were far more limited\r\nin size than had been supposed, and even might not exist as true seas.\r\nProfessor Barnard, with the Lick thirty-six inch telescope, discerned an\r\nastonishing wealth of detail on the surface of Mars, so intricate,\r\nminute, and abundant, that it baffled all attempts to delineate it; and\r\nthese peculiarities were seen upon the supposed seas as well as on the\r\nland-surfaces. In fact, under the best conditions these 'seas' lost all\r\ntrace of uniformity, their appearance being that of a mountainous\r\ncountry, broken by ridges, rifts, and canyons, seen from a great\r\nelevation. As we shall see later on these doubts soon became\r\ncertainties, and it is now almost universally admitted that Mars\r\npossesses no permanent bodies of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PERCIVAL LOWELL'S DISCOVERIES AND THEORIES.\r\n\r\n_The Observatory in Arizona._\r\n\r\nIn 1894, after a careful search for the best atmospheric conditions, Mr.\r\nLowell established his observatory near the town of Flagstaff in\r\nArizona, in a very dry and uniform climate, and at an elevation of 7300\r\nfeet above the sea. He then possessed a fine equatorial telescope of 18\r\ninches aperture and 26 feet focal length, besides two smaller ones, all\r\nof the best quality. To these he added in 1896 a telescope with 24 inch\r\nobject glass, the last work of the celebrated firm of Alvan Clark &\r\nSons, with which he has made his later discoveries. He thus became\r\nperhaps more favourably situated than any astronomer in the northern\r\nhemisphere, and during the last twelve years has made a specialty of the\r\nstudy of Mars, besides doing much valuable astronomical work on other\r\nplanets.\r\n\r\n_Mr, Lowell's recent Books upon Mars._\r\n\r\nIn 1905 Mr. Lowell published an illustrated volume giving a full account\r\nof his observations of Mars from 1894 to 1903, chiefly for the use of\r\nastronomers; and he has now given us a popular volume summarising the\r\nwhole of his work on the planet, and published both in America and\r\nEngland by the Macmillan Company. This very interesting volume is fully\r\nillustrated with twenty plates, four of them coloured, and more than\r\nforty figures in the text, showing the great variety of details from\r\nwhich the larger general maps have been constructed.\r\n\r\n_Non-natural Features of Mars._\r\n\r\nBut what renders this work especially interesting to all intelligent\r\nreaders is, that the author has here, for the first time, fully set\r\nforth his views both as to the habitability of Mars and as to its being\r\nactually inhabited by beings comparable with ourselves in intellect. The\r\nlarger part of the work is in fact devoted to a detailed description of\r\nwhat he terms the 'Non-natural Features' of the planet's surface,\r\nincluding especially a full account of the 'Canals,' single and double;\r\nthe 'Oases,' as he terms the dark spots at their intersections; and the\r\nvarying visibility of both, depending partly on the Martian seasons;\r\nwhile the five concluding chapters deal with the possibility of animal\r\nlife and the evidence in favour of it. He also upholds the theory of the\r\ncanals having been constructed for the purpose of 'husbanding' the\r\nscanty water-supply that exists; and throughout the whole of this\r\nargument he clearly shows that he considers the evidence to be\r\nsatisfactory, and that the only intelligible explanation of the whole of\r\nthe phenomena he so clearly sets forth is, that the inhabitants of Mars\r\nhave carried out on their small and naturally inhospitable planet a vast\r\nsystem of irrigation-works, far greater both in its extent, in its\r\nutility, and its effect upon their world as a habitation for civilised\r\nbeings, than anything we have yet done upon our earth, where our\r\ndestructive agencies are perhaps more prominent than those of an\r\nimproving and recuperative character.\r\n\r\n_A Challenge to the Thinking World._\r\n\r\nThis volume is therefore in the nature of a challenge, not so much to\r\nastronomers as to the educated world at large, to investigate the\r\nevidence for so portentous a conclusion. To do this requires only a\r\ngeneral acquaintance with modern science, more especially with mechanics\r\nand physics, while the main contention (with which I shall chiefly deal)\r\nthat the features termed 'canals' are really works of art and\r\nnecessitate the presence of intelligent organic beings, requires only\r\ncare and judgment in drawing conclusions from admitted facts. As I have\r\nalready paid some attention to this problem and have expressed the\r\nopinion that Mars is not habitable,[2] judging from the evidence then\r\navailable, and as few men of science have the leisure required for a\r\ncareful examination of so speculative a subject, I propose here to point\r\nout what the facts, as stated by Mr. Lowell himself, do _not_ render\r\neven probable much less prove. Incidentally, I may be able to adduce\r\nevidence of a more or less weighty character, which seems to negative\r\nthe possibility of any high form of animal life on Mars, and, _a\r\nfortiori_, the development of such life as might culminate in a being\r\nequal or superior to ourselves. As most popular works on Astronomy for\r\nthe last ten years at least, as well as many scientific periodicals and\r\npopular magazines, have reproduced some of the maps of Mars by\r\nSchiaparelli, Lowell, and others, the general appearance of its surface\r\nwill be familiar to most readers, who will thus be fully able to\r\nappreciate Mr. Lowell's account of his own further discoveries which I\r\nmay have to quote. One of the _best_ of these maps I am able to give as\r\na frontispiece to this volume, and to this I shall mainly refer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Man's Place in the Universe_ p. 267 (1903).]\r\n\r\n_The Canals as described by Mr. Lowell._\r\n\r\nIn the clear atmosphere of Arizona, Mr. Lowell has been able on various\r\nfavourable occasions to detect a network of straight lines, meeting or\r\ncrossing each other at various angles, and often extending to a thousand\r\nor even over two thousand miles in length. They are seen to cross both\r\nthe light and the dark regions of the planet's surface, often extending\r\nup to or starting from the polar snow-caps. Most of these lines are so\r\nfine as only to be visible on special occasions of atmospheric clearness\r\nand steadiness, which hardly ever occur at lowland stations, even with\r\nthe best instruments, and almost all are seen to be as perfectly\r\nstraight as if drawn with a ruler.\r\n\r\n_The Double Canals._\r\n\r\nUnder exceptionally favourable conditions, many of the lines that have\r\nbeen already seen single appear double--a pair of equally fine lines\r\nexactly parallel throughout their whole length, and appearing, as Mr.\r\nLowell says, \"clear cut upon the disc, its twin lines like the rails of\r\na railway track.\" Both Schiaparelli and Lowell were at first so\r\nsurprised at this phenomenon that they thought it must be an optical\r\nillusion, and it was only after many observations in different years,\r\nand by the application of every conceivable test, that they both became\r\nconvinced that they witnessed a real feature of the planet's surface.\r\nMr. Lowell says he has now seen them hundreds of times, and that his\r\nfirst view of one was 'the most startlingly impressive' sight he has\r\never witnessed.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions of the Canals._\r\n\r\nA few dimensions of these strange objects must be given in order that\r\nreaders may appreciate their full strangeness and inexplicability. Out\r\nof more than four hundred canals seen and recorded by Mr. Lowell,\r\nfifty-one, or about one eighth, are either constantly or occasionally\r\nseen to be double, the appearance of duplicity being more or less\r\nperiodical. Of 'canals' generally, Mr. Lowell states that they vary in\r\nlength from a few hundred to a few thousand miles long, one of the\r\nlargest being the Phison, which he terms 'a typical double canal,' and\r\nwhich is said to be 2250 miles long, while the distance between its two\r\nconstituents is about 130 miles.[3] The actual width of each canal is\r\nfrom a minimum of about a mile up to several miles, in one case over\r\ntwenty. A great feature of the doubles is, that they are strictly\r\nparallel throughout their whole course, and that in almost all cases\r\nthey are so truly straight as to form parts of a great circle of the\r\nplanet's sphere. A few however follow a gradual but very distinct curve,\r\nand such of these as are double present the same strict parallelism as\r\nthose which are straight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This is on the opposite side of Mars from that shown in the\r\nfrontispiece.]\r\n\r\n_Canals extend across the Seas._\r\n\r\nIt was only after seventeen years of observation of the canals that it\r\nwas found that they extended also into and across the dark spots and\r\nsurfaces which by the earlier observers were termed seas, and which then\r\nformed the only clearly distinguishable and permanent marks on the\r\nplanet's surface. At the present time, Professor Lowell states that this\r\n\"curious triangulation has been traced over almost every portion of the\r\nplanet's surface, whether dark or light, whether greenish, ochre, or\r\nbrown in colour.\" In some parts they are much closer together than in\r\nothers, \"forming a perfect network of lines and spots, so that to\r\nidentify them all was a matter of extreme difficulty.\" Two such portions\r\nare figured at pages 247 and 256 of Mr. Lowell's volume.\r\n\r\n_The Oases._\r\n\r\nThe curious circular black spots which are seen at the intersections of\r\nmany of the canals, and which in some parts of the surface are very\r\nnumerous, are said to be more difficult of detection than even the\r\nlines, being often blurred or rendered completely invisible by slight\r\nirregularities in our own atmosphere, while the canals themselves\r\ncontinue visible. About 180 of these have now been found, and the more\r\nprominent of them are estimated to vary from 75 to 100 miles in\r\ndiameter. There are however many much smaller, down to minute and barely\r\nvisible black points. Yet they all seem a little larger than the canals\r\nwhich enter them. Where the canals are double, the spots (or 'oases' as\r\nMr. Lowell terms them) lie between the two parallel canals.\r\n\r\nNo one can read this book without admiration for the extreme\r\nperseverance in long continued and successful observation, the results\r\nof which are here recorded; and I myself accept unreservedly the\r\nsubstantial accuracy of the whole series. It must however always be\r\nremembered that the growth of knowledge of the detailed markings has\r\nbeen very gradual, and that much of it has only been seen under very\r\nrare and exceptional conditions. It is therefore quite possible that, if\r\nat some future time a further considerable advance in instrumental power\r\nshould be made, or a still more favourable locality be found, the new\r\ndiscoveries might so modify present appearances as to render a\r\nsatisfactory explanation of them more easy than it is at present.\r\n\r\nBut though I wish to do the fullest justice to Mr. Lowell's technical\r\nskill and long years of persevering work, which have brought to light\r\nthe most complex and remarkable appearances that any of the heavenly\r\nbodies present to us, I am obliged absolutely to part company with him\r\nas regards the startling theory of artificial production which he thinks\r\nalone adequate to explain them. So much is this the case, that the very\r\nphenomena, which to him seem to demonstrate the intervention of\r\nintelligent beings working for the improvement of their own environment,\r\nare those which seem to me to bear the unmistakable impress of being due\r\nto natural forces, while they are wholly unintelligible as being useful\r\nworks of art. I refer of course to the great system of what are termed\r\n'canals,' whether single or double. Of these I shall give my own\r\ninterpretation later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY OF MARS.\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell admits, and indeed urges strongly, that there are no\r\npermanent bodies of water on Mars; that the dark spaces and spots,\r\nthought by the early observers to be seas, are certainly not so now,\r\nthough they may have been at an earlier period; that true clouds are\r\nrare, even if they exist, the appearances that have been taken for them\r\nbeing either dust-storms or a surface haze; that there is consequently\r\nno rain, and that large portions (about two-thirds) of the planet's\r\nsurface have all the characteristics of desert regions.\r\n\r\n_Snow-caps the only Source of Water._\r\n\r\nThis state of things is supposed to be ameliorated by the fact of the\r\npolar snows, which in the winter cover the arctic and about half the\r\ntemperate regions of each hemisphere alternately. The maximum of the\r\nnorthern snow-caps is reached at a period of the Martian winter\r\ncorresponding to the end of February with us. About the end of March the\r\ncap begins to shrink in size (in the Northern Hemisphere), and this goes\r\non so rapidly that early in the June of Mars it is reduced to its\r\nminimum. About the same time changes of colour take place in the\r\nadjacent darker portions of the surface, which become at first bluish,\r\nand later a decided blue-green; but by far the larger portion, including\r\nalmost all the equatorial regions of the planet, remain always of a\r\nreddish-ochre tint.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: In 1890 at Mount Wilson, California, Mr. W.H. Pickering's\r\nphotographs of Mars on April 9th showed the southern polar cap of\r\nmoderate dimensions, but with a large dim adjacent area. Twenty-four\r\nhours later a corresponding plate showed this same area brilliantly\r\nwhite; the result apparently of a great Martian snowfall. In 1882 the\r\nsame observer witnessed the steady disappearance of 1,600,000 square\r\nmiles of the southern snow-cap, an area nearly one-third of that\r\nhemisphere of the planet.]\r\n\r\nThe rapid and comparatively early disappearance of the white covering\r\nis, very reasonably, supposed to prove that it is of small thickness,\r\ncorresponding perhaps to about a foot or two of snow in north-temperate\r\nAmerica and Europe, and that by the increasing amount of sun-heat it is\r\nconverted, partly into liquid and partly into vapour. Coincident with\r\nthis disappearance and as a presumed result of the water (or other\r\nliquid) producing inundations, the bluish-green tinge which appears on\r\nthe previously dark portion of the surface is supposed to be due to a\r\nrapid growth of vegetation.\r\n\r\nBut the evidence on this point does not seem to be clear or harmonious,\r\nfor in the four coloured plates showing the planet's surface at\r\nsuccessive Martian dates from December 30th to February 21st, not only\r\nis a considerable extent of the south temperate zone shown to change\r\nrapidly from bluish-green to chocolate-brown and then again to\r\nbluish-green, but the portions furthest from the supposed fertilising\r\noverflow are permanently green, as are also considerable portions in the\r\nopposite or northern hemisphere, which one would think would then be\r\ncompletely dried up.\r\n\r\n_No Hills upon Mars._\r\n\r\nThe special point to which I here wish to call attention is this. Mr.\r\nLowell's main contention is, that the surface of Mars is wonderfully\r\nsmooth and level. Not only are there no mountains, but there are no\r\nhills or valleys or plateaux. This assumption is absolutely essential to\r\nsupport the other great assumption, that the wonderful network of\r\nperfectly straight lines over nearly the whole surface of the planet are\r\nirrigation canals. It is not alleged that irregularities or undulations\r\nof a few hundreds or even one or two thousands of feet could possibly be\r\ndetected, while certainly all we know of planetary formation or\r\nstructure point strongly towards _some_ inequalities of surface. Mr.\r\nLowell admits that the dark portions of the surface, when examined on\r\nthe terminator (the margin of the illuminated portion), do _look_ like\r\nhollows and _may be_ the beds of dried-up seas; yet the supposed canals\r\nrun across these old sea-beds in perfect straight lines just as they do\r\nacross the many thousand miles of what are admitted to be deserts--which\r\nhe describes in these forcible terms: \"Pitiless as our deserts are, they\r\nare but faint forecasts of the state of things existent on Mars at the\r\npresent time.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that Mr. Lowell has to face this dilemma--_Only if the\r\nwhole surface of Mars is an almost perfect level could the enormous\r\nnetwork of straight canals, each from hundreds to thousands of miles\r\nlong, have been possibly constructed by intelligent beings for purposes\r\nof irrigation; but, if a complete and universal level surface exists no\r\nsuch system would be necessary._ For on a level surface--or on a\r\nsurface slightly inclined from the poles towards the equator, which\r\nwould be advantageous in either case--the melting water would of itself\r\nspread over the ground and naturally irrigate as much of the surface as\r\nit was possible for it to reach. If the surface were not level, but\r\nconsisted of slight elevations and expressions to the extent of a few\r\nscores or a few hundreds of feet, then there would be no possible\r\nadvantage in cutting straight troughs through these elevations in\r\nvarious directions with water flowing at the bottom of them. In neither\r\ncase, and in hardly any conceivable case, could these perfectly straight\r\ncanals, cutting across each other in every direction and at very varying\r\nangles, be of any use, or be the work of an intelligent race, if any\r\nsuch race could possibly have been developed under the adverse\r\nconditions which exist in Mars.\r\n\r\n_The Scanty Water-supply._\r\n\r\nBut further, if there were any superfluity of water derived from the\r\nmelting snow beyond what was sufficient to moisten the hollows indicated\r\nby the darker portions of the surface, which at the time the water\r\nreaches them acquire a green tint (a superfluity under the circumstances\r\nhighly improbable), that superfluity could be best utilised by widening,\r\nhowever little, the borders to which natural overflow had carried it.\r\nAny attempt to make that scanty surplus, by means of overflowing canals,\r\ntravel across the equator into the opposite hemisphere, through such a\r\nterrible desert region and exposed to such a cloudless sky as Mr. Lowell\r\ndescribes, would be the work of a body of madmen rather than of\r\nintelligent beings. It may be safely asserted that not one drop of water\r\nwould escape evaporation or insoak at even a hundred miles from its\r\nsource. [5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: What the evaporation is likely to be in Mars may be\r\nestimated by the fact, stated by Professor J.W. Gregory in his recent\r\nvolume on 'Australia' in _Stanford's Compendium_, that in North-West\r\nVictoria evaporation is at the rate of ten feet per annum, while in\r\nCentral Australia it is very much more. The greatly diminished\r\natmospheric pressure in Mars will probably more than balance the loss of\r\nsun-heat in producing rapid evaporation.]\r\n\r\n_Miss Clerke on the Scanty Water-supply._\r\n\r\nOn this point I am supported by no less an authority than the historian\r\nof modern astronomy, the late Miss Agnes Clerke. In the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_ (of October 1896) there is an article entitled 'New Views about\r\nMars,' exhibiting the writer's characteristic fulness of knowledge and\r\ncharm of style. Speaking of Mr. Lowell's idea of the 'canals' carrying\r\nthe surplus water across the equator, far into the opposite hemisphere,\r\nfor purposes of irrigation there (which we see he again states in the\r\npresent volume), Miss Clerke writes: \"We can hardly imagine so shrewd a\r\npeople as the irrigators of Thule and Hellas[6] wasting labour, and the\r\nlife-giving fluid, after so unprofitable a fashion. There is every\r\nreason to believe that the Martian snow-caps are quite flimsy\r\nstructures. Their material might be called snow _soufflé_, since, owing\r\nto the small power of gravity on Mars, snow is almost three times\r\nlighter there than here. Consequently, its own weight can have very\r\nlittle effect in rendering it compact. Nor, indeed, is there time for\r\nmuch settling down. The calotte does not form until several months after\r\nthe winter solstice, and it begins to melt, as a rule, shortly after the\r\nvernal equinox. (The interval between these two epochs in the southern\r\nhemisphere of Mars is 176 days.) The snow lies on the ground, at the\r\noutside, a couple of months. At times it melts while it is still fresh\r\nfallen. Thus, at the opposition of 1881-82 the spreading of the northern\r\nsnows was delayed until seven weeks after the equinox: and they had,\r\naccordingly, no sooner reached their maximum than they began to decline.\r\nAnd Professor Pickering's photographs of April 9th and 10th, 1890,\r\nproved that the southern calotte may assume its definitive proportions\r\nin a single night.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Areas on Mars so named.]\r\n\r\n\"No attempt has yet been made to estimate the quantity of water\r\nderivable from the melting of one of these formations; yet the\r\nexperiment is worth trying as a help towards defining ideas. Let us\r\ngrant that the average depth of snow in them, of the delicate Martian\r\nkind, is twenty feet, equivalent at the most to one foot of water. The\r\nmaximum area covered, of 2,400,000 square miles, is nearly equal to that\r\nof the United States, while the whole globe of Mars measures 55,500,000\r\nsquare miles, of which one-third, on the present hypothesis, is under\r\ncultivation, and in need of water. Nearly the whole of the dark areas,\r\nas we know, are situated in the southern hemisphere, of which they\r\nextend over, at the very least, 17,000,000 square miles; that is to say,\r\nthey cover an area, in round numbers, seven times that of the snow-cap.\r\nOnly one-seventh of a foot of water, accordingly, could possibly be\r\nmade available for their fertilisation, supposing them to get the entire\r\nadvantage of the spring freshet. Upon a stint of less than two inches of\r\nwater these fertile lands are expected to flourish and bear abundant\r\ncrops; and since they completely enclose the polar area they are\r\nnecessarily served first. The great emissaries for carrying off the\r\nsurplus of their aqueous riches, would then appear to be superfluous\r\nconstructions, nor is it likely that the share in those riches due to\r\nthe canals and oases, intricately dividing up the wide, dry, continental\r\nplains, can ever be realised.\r\n\r\n\"We have assumed, in our little calculation, that the entire contents of\r\na polar hood turn to water; but in actual fact a considerable proportion\r\nof them must pass directly into vapour, omitting the intermediate stage.\r\nEven with us a large quantity of snow is removed aerially; and in the\r\nrare atmosphere of Mars this cause of waste must be especially\r\neffective. Thus the polar reservoirs are despoiled in the act of being\r\nopened. Further objections might be taken to Mr. Lowell's irrigation\r\nscheme, but enough has been said to show that it is hopelessly\r\nunworkable.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the writer of this article accepted the existence\r\nof water on Mars, on the testimony of Sir W. Huggins, which, in view of\r\nlater observations, he has himself acknowledged to be valueless. Dr.\r\nJohnstone Stoney's proof of its absence, derived from the molecular\r\ntheory of gases, had not then been made public.\r\n\r\n_Description of some of the Canals._\r\n\r\nAt the end of his volume Mr. Lowell gives a large chart of Mars on\r\nMercator's projection, showing the canals and other features seen during\r\nthe opposition of 1905. This contains many canals not shown on the map\r\nhere reproduced (see frontispiece), and some of the differences between\r\nthe two are very puzzling. Looking at our map, which shows the\r\nnorth-polar snow below, so that the south pole is out of the view at the\r\ntop of the map, the central feature is the large spot Ascraeeus Lucus,\r\nfrom which ten canals diverge centrally, and four from the sides,\r\nforming wide double canals, fourteen in all. There is also a canal named\r\nUlysses, which here passes far to the right of the spot, but in the\r\nlarge chart enters it centrally. Looking at our map we see, going\r\ndownwards a little to the left, the canal Udon, which runs through a\r\ndark area quite to the outer margin. In the dark area, however, there is\r\nshown on the chart a spot Aspledon Lucus, where five canals meet, and if\r\nthis is taken as a terminus the Udon canal is almost exactly 2000 miles\r\nlong, and another on its right, Lapadon, is the same length, while Ich,\r\nrunning in a slightly curved line to a large spot (Lucus Castorius on\r\nthe chart) is still longer. The Ulysses canal, which (on the chart) runs\r\nstraight from the point of the Mare Sirenum to the Astraeeus Lucus is\r\nabout 2200 miles long. Others however are even longer, and Mr. Lowell\r\nsays: \"With them 2000 miles is common; while many exceed 2500; and the\r\nEumenides-Orcus is 3540 miles from the point where it leaves Lucus\r\nPhoeniceus to where it enters the Trivium Charontis.\" This last canal is\r\nbarely visible on our map, its commencement being indicated by the word\r\nEumenides.\r\n\r\nThe Trivium Charontis is situated just beyond the right-hand margin of\r\nour map. It is a triangular dark area, the sides about 200 miles long,\r\nand it is shown on the chart as being the centre from which radiate\r\nthirteen canals. Another centre is Aquae Calidae situated at the point\r\nof a dark area running obliquely from 55° to 35° N. latitude, and, as\r\nshown on a map of the opposite hemisphere to our map, has nearly twenty\r\ncanals radiating from it in almost every direction. Here at all events\r\nthere seems to be no special connection with the polar snow-caps, and\r\nthe radiating lines seem to have no intelligent purpose whatever, but\r\nare such as might result from fractures in a glass globe produced by\r\nfiring at it with very small shots one at a time. Taking the whole\r\nseries of them, Mr. Lowell very justly compares them to \"a network which\r\ntriangulates the surface of the planet like a geodetic survey, into\r\npolygons of all shapes and sizes.\"\r\n\r\nAt the very lowest estimate the total length of the canals observed and\r\nmapped by Mr. Lowell must be over a hundred thousand miles, while he\r\nassures us that numbers of others have been seen over the whole surface,\r\nbut so faintly or on such rare occasions as to elude all attempts to fix\r\ntheir position with certainty. But these, being of the same character\r\nand evidently forming part of the same system, must also be artificial,\r\nand thus we are led to a system of irrigation of almost unimaginable\r\nmagnitude on a planet which has no mountains, no rivers, and no rain to\r\nsupport it; whose whole water-supply is derived from polar snows, the\r\namount of which is ludicrously inadequate to need any such world-wide\r\nsystem; while the low atmospheric pressure would lead to rapid\r\nevaporation, thus greatly diminishing the small amount of moisture that\r\nis available. Everyone must, I think, agree with Miss Clerke, that, even\r\nadmitting the assumption that the polar snows consist of frozen water,\r\nthe excessively scanty amount of water thus obtained would render any\r\nscheme of world-wide distribution of it hopelessly unworkable.\r\n\r\nThe very remarkable phenomena of the duplication of many of the lines,\r\ntogether with the darkspots--the so-called oases--at their\r\nintersections, are doubtless all connected in some unknown way with the\r\nconstitution and past history of the planet; but, on the theory of the\r\nwhole being works of art, they certainly do _not_ help to remove any of\r\nthe difficulties which have been shown to attend the theory that the\r\nsingle lines represent artificial canals of irrigation with a strip of\r\nverdure on each side of them produced by their overflow.\r\n\r\n_Lowell on the Purpose of the Canals._\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject it will be well to quote Mr. Lowell's own\r\nwords as to the supposed perfectly level surface of Mars, and his\r\ninterpretation of the origin and purpose of the 'canals':\r\n\r\n\"A body of planetary size, if unrotating, becomes a sphere, except for\r\nsolar tidal deformation; if rotating, it takes on a spheroidal form\r\nexactly expressive, so far as observation goes, of the so-called\r\ncentrifugal force at work. Mars presents such a figure, being flattened\r\nout to correspond to its axial rotation. Its surface therefore is in\r\nfluid equilibrium, or, in other words, a particle of liquid at any point\r\nof its surface at the present time would stay where it was devoid of\r\ninclination to move elsewhere. Now the water which quickens the verdure\r\nof the canals moves from the pole down to the equator as the season\r\nadvances. This it does then irrespective of gravity. No natural force\r\npropels it, and the inference is forthright and inevitable that it is\r\nartificially helped to its end. There seems to be no escape from this\r\ndeduction. Water only flows downhill, and there is no such thing as\r\ndownhill on a surface already in fluid equilibrium. A few canals might\r\npresumably be so situated that their flow could, by inequality of\r\nterrane, lie equatorward, but not all....Now it is not in particular but\r\nby general consent that the canal-system of Mars develops from pole to\r\nequator. From the respective times at which the minima take place, it\r\nappears that the canal quickening occupies fifty-two days, as evidenced\r\nby the successive vegetal darkenings, to descend from latitude 72° north\r\nto latitude 0°, a journey of 2650 miles. This gives for the water a\r\nspeed of fifty-one miles a day, or 2.1 miles an hour. The rate of\r\nprogression is remarkably uniform, and this abets the deduction as to\r\nassisted transference. But the fact is more unnatural yet. The growth\r\npays no regard to the equator, but proceeds across it as if it did not\r\nexist into the planet's other hemisphere. Here is something still more\r\ntelling than travel to this point. For even if we suppose, for the sake\r\nof argument, that natural forces took the water down to the equator,\r\ntheir action must there be certainly reversed, and the equator prove a\r\ndead-line, to pass which were impossible\" (pp. 374-5).\r\n\r\nI think my readers will agree with me that this whole argument is one of\r\nthe most curious ever put forth seriously by an eminent man of science.\r\nBecause the polar compression of Mars is about what calculation shows it\r\nought to be in accordance with its rate of rotation, its surface is in a\r\nstate of 'fluid equilibrium,' and must therefore be absolutely level\r\nthroughout. But the polar compression of the earth equally agrees with\r\ncalculation; therefore its surface is also in 'fluid equilibrium';\r\ntherefore it also ought to be as perfectly level on land as it is on the\r\nocean surface! But as we know this is very far from being the case, why\r\nmust it be so in Mars? Are we to suppose Mars to have been formed in\r\nsome totally different way from other planets, and that there neither is\r\nnor ever has been any reaction between its interior and exterior forces?\r\nAgain, the assumption of perfect flatness is directly opposed to all\r\nobservation and all analogy with what we see on the earth and moon. It\r\ngives no account whatever of the numerous and large dark patches, once\r\ntermed seas, but now found to be not so, and to be full of detailed\r\nmarkings and varied depths of shadow. To suppose that these are all the\r\nsame dead-level as the light-coloured portions are assumed to be,\r\nimplies that the darkness is one of material and colour only, not of\r\ndiversified contour, which again is contrary to experience, since\r\ndifference of material with us always leads to differences in rate of\r\ndegradation, and hence of diversified contour, as these dark spaces\r\nactually show themselves under favourable conditions to independent\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\n_Lowell on the System of Canals as a whole._\r\n\r\nWe will now see what Mr. Lowell claims to be the plain teaching of the\r\n'canals' as a whole:\r\n\r\n\"But last and all-embracing in its import is the system which the canals\r\nform. Instead of running at hap-hazard, the canals are interconnected in\r\na most remarkable manner. They seek centres instead of avoiding them.\r\nThe centres are linked thus perfectly one with another, an arrangement\r\nwhich could not result from centres, whether of explosion or otherwise,\r\nwhich were themselves discrete. Furthermore, the system covers the whole\r\nsurface of the planet, dark areas and light ones alike, a world-wide\r\ndistribution which exceeds the bounds of natural possibility. Any force\r\nwhich could act longitudinally on such a scale must be limited\r\nlatitudinally in its action, as witness the belts of Jupiter and the\r\nspots upon the sun. Rotational, climatic, or other physical cause could\r\nnot fail of zonal expression. Yet these lines are grandly indifferent to\r\nsuch competing influences. Finally, the system, after meshing the\r\nsurface in its entirety, runs straight into the polar caps.\r\n\r\n\"It is, then, a system whose end and aim is the tapping of the snow-cap\r\nfor the water there semi-annually let loose; then to distribute it over\r\nthe planet's face\" (p. 373).\r\n\r\nHere, again, we have curiously weak arguments adduced to support the\r\nview that these numerous straight lines imply works of art rather than\r\nof nature, especially in the comparison made with the belts of Jupiter\r\nand the spots on the sun, both purely atmospheric phenomena, whereas the\r\nlines on Mars are on the solid surface of the planet. Why should there\r\nbe any resemblance between them? Every fact stated in the above\r\nquotation, always keeping in mind the physical conditions of the\r\nplanet--its very tenuous atmosphere and rainless desert-surface--seem\r\nwholly in favour of a purely natural as opposed to an artificial origin;\r\nand at the close of this discussion I shall suggest one which seems to\r\nme to be at least possible, and to explain the whole series of the\r\nphenomena set forth and largely discovered by Mr. Lowell, in a simpler\r\nand more probable manner than does his tremendous assumption of their\r\nbeing works of art. Readers who may not possess Mr. Lowell's volume will\r\nfind three of his most recent maps of the 'canals' reproduced in\r\n_Nature_ of October 11th, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS ANIMAL LIFE POSSIBLE ON MARS?\r\n\r\nHaving now shown, that, even admitting the accuracy of all Mr. Lowell's\r\nobservations, and provisionally accepting all his chief conclusions as\r\nto the climate, the nature of the snow-caps, the vegetation, and the\r\nanimal life of Mars, yet his interpretation of the lines on its surface\r\nas being veritably 'canals,' constructed by intelligent beings for the\r\nspecial purpose of carrying water to the more arid regions, is wholly\r\nerroneous and rationally inconceivable. I now proceed to discuss his\r\nmore fundamental position as to the actual habitability of Mars by a\r\nhighly organised and intellectual race of material organic beings.\r\n\r\n_Water and Air essential to Life._\r\n\r\nHere, fortunately, the issue is rendered very simple, because Mr. Lowell\r\nfully recognises the identity of the constitution of matter and of\r\nphysical laws throughout the solar-system, and that for any high form of\r\norganic life certain conditions which are absolutely essential on our\r\nearth must also exist in Mars. He admits, for example, that water is\r\nessential, that an atmosphere containing oxygen, nitrogen, aqueous\r\nvapour, and carbonic acid gas is essential, and that an abundant\r\nvegetation is essential; and these of course involve a\r\nsurface-temperature through a considerable portion of the year that\r\nrenders the existence of these--especially of water--possible and\r\navailable for the purposes of a high and abundant animal life.\r\n\r\n_Blue Colour the only Evidence of Water._\r\n\r\nIn attempting to show that these essentials actually exist on Mars he is\r\nnot very successful. He adduces evidence of an atmosphere, but of an\r\nexceedingly scanty one, since the greatest amount he can give to it is--\r\n\"not more than about four inches of barometric pressure as we reckon\r\nit\";[7] and he assumes, as he has a fair right to do till disproved,\r\nthat it consists of oxygen and nitrogen, with carbon-dioxide and\r\nwater-vapour, in approximately the same proportions as with us. With\r\nregard to the last item--the water-vapour--there are however many\r\nserious difficulties. The water-vapour of our atmosphere is derived from\r\nthe enormous area of our seas, oceans, lakes, and rivers, as well as\r\nfrom the evaporation from heated lands and tropical forests of much of\r\nthe moisture produced by frequent and abundant rains. All these sources\r\nof supply are admittedly absent from Mars, which has no permanent bodies\r\nof water, no rain, and tropical regions which are almost entirely\r\ndesert. Many writers have therefore doubted the existence of water in\r\nany form upon this planet, supposing that the snow-caps are not formed\r\nof frozen water but of carbon-dioxide, or some other heavy gas, in a\r\nfrozen state; and Mr. Lowell evidently feels this to be a difficulty,\r\nsince the only fact he is able to adduce in favour of the melting snows\r\nof the polar caps producing water is, that at the time they are melting\r\na marginal blue band appears which accompanies them in their retreat,\r\nand this blue colour is said to prove conclusively that the liquid is\r\nnot carbonic acid but water. This point he dwells upon repeatedly,\r\nstating, of these blue borders: \"This excludes the possibility of their\r\nbeing formed by carbon-dioxide, and shows that of all the substances we\r\nknow the material composing them must be water.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: In a paper written since the book appeared the density of\r\nair at the surface of Mars is said to be 1/12 of the earth's.]\r\n\r\nThis is the only proof of the existence of _water_ he adduces, and it is\r\ncertainly a most extraordinary and futile one. For it is perfectly well\r\nknown that although water, in large masses and by transmitted light, is\r\nof a blue colour, yet shallow water by reflected light is not so; and in\r\nthe case of the liquid produced by the snow-caps of Mars, which the\r\nwhole conditions of the planet show must be shallow, and also be more or\r\nless turbid, it cannot possibly be the cause of the 'deep blue' tint\r\nsaid to result from the melting of the snow.\r\n\r\nBut there is a very weighty argument depending on the molecular theory\r\nof gases against the polar caps of Mars being composed of frozen water\r\nat all. The mass and elastic force of the several gases is due to the\r\ngreater or less rapidity of the vibratory motion of their molecules\r\nunder identical conditions. The speed of these molecular motions has\r\nbeen ascertained for all the chief gases, and it is found to be so great\r\nas in certain cases to enable them to overcome the force of gravity and\r\nescape from a planet's surface into space. Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney has\r\nspecially investigated this subject, and he finds that the force of\r\ngravity on the earth is sufficient to retain all the gases composing its\r\natmosphere, but not sufficient to retain hydrogen; and as a consequence,\r\nalthough this gas is produced in small quantities by volcanoes and by\r\ndecomposing vegetation, yet no trace of it is found in our atmosphere.\r\nThe moon however, having only one-eightieth the mass of the earth,\r\ncannot retain any gas, hence its airless and waterless condition.\r\n\r\n_Water Vapour cannot exist on Mars._\r\n\r\nNow, Dr. Stoney finds that in order to retain water vapour permanently a\r\nplanet must have a mass at least a quarter that of the earth. But the\r\nmass of Mars is only one-ninth that of the earth; therefore, unless\r\nthere are some special conditions that prevent its loss, this gas cannot\r\nbe present in the atmosphere. Mr. Lowell does not refer to this argument\r\nagainst his view, neither does he claim the evidence of spectroscopy in\r\nhis favour. This was alleged more than thirty years ago to show the\r\nexistence of water-vapour in the atmosphere of Mars, but of late years\r\nit has been doubted, and Mr. Lowell's complete silence on the subject,\r\nwhile laying stress on such a very weak and inconclusive argument as\r\nthat from the tinge of colour that is observed a little distance from\r\nthe edge of the diminishing snow-caps, shows that he himself does not\r\nthink the fact to be thus proved. If he did he would hardly adduce such\r\nan argument for its presence as the following: \"The melting of the caps\r\non the one hand and their re-forming on the other affirm the presence of\r\nwater-vapour in the Martian atmosphere, of whatever else that air\r\nconsists\" (p. 162). Yet absolutely the only proof he gives that the caps\r\nare frozen water is the almost frivolous colour-argument above referred\r\nto!\r\n\r\n_No Spectroscopic Evidence of Water Vapour._\r\n\r\nAs Sir William Huggins is the chief authority quoted for this fact, and\r\nis referred to as being almost conclusive in the third edition of Miss\r\nClerke's _History of Astronomy_ in 1893, I have ascertained that his\r\nopinion at the present time is that \"there is no conclusive proof of the\r\npresence of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere of Mars, and that\r\nobservations at the Lick Observatory (in 1895), where the conditions and\r\ninstruments are of the highest order, were negative.\" He also informs me\r\nthat Marchand at the Pic du Midi Observatory was unable to obtain lines\r\nof aqueous vapour in the spectrum of Mars; and that in 1905, Slipher, at\r\nMr. Lowell's observatory, was unable to detect any indications of\r\naqueous vapour in the spectrum of Mars.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that spectroscopic observations are quite accordant with\r\nthe calculations founded on the molecular theory of gases as to the\r\nabsence of aqueous vapour, and therefore presumably of liquid water,\r\nfrom Mars. It is true that the spectroscopic argument is purely\r\nnegative, and this may be due to the extreme delicacy of the\r\nobservations required; but that dependent on the inability of the force\r\nof gravity to retain it is positive scientific evidence against its\r\npresence, and, till shown to be erroneous, must be held to be\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\nThis absence of water is of itself conclusive against the existence of\r\nanimal life, unless we enter the regions of pure conjecture as to the\r\npossibility of some other liquid being able to take its place, and that\r\nliquid being as omnipresent there as water is here. Mr. Lowell however\r\nnever takes this ground, but bases his whole theory on the fundamental\r\nidentity of the substance of the bodies of living organisms wherever\r\nthey may exist in the solar system. In the next two chapters I shall\r\ndiscuss an equally essential condition, that of temperature, which\r\naffords a still more conclusive and even crushing argument against the\r\nsuitability of Mars for the existence of organic life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPERATURE OF MARS--MR. LOWELL'S ESTIMATE.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider a still more important and fundamental question,\r\nand one which Mr. Lowell does not grapple with in this volume, the\r\nactual temperatures on Mars due to its distance from the sun and the\r\natmospheric conditions on which he himself lays so much stress. If I am\r\nnot greatly mistaken we shall arrive at conclusions on this subject\r\nwhich are absolutely fatal to the conception of any high form of organic\r\nlife being possible on this planet.\r\n\r\n_The Problem of Terrestrial Temperatures._\r\n\r\nIn order that the problem may be understood and its importance\r\nappreciated, it is necessary to explain the now generally accepted\r\nprinciples as to the causes which determine the temperatures on our\r\nearth, and, presumably, on all other planets whose conditions are not\r\nwholly unlike ours. The fact of the internal heat of the earth which\r\nbecomes very perceptible even at the moderate depths reached in mines\r\nand deep borings, and in the deepest mines becomes a positive\r\ninconvenience, leads many people to suppose that the surface-\r\ntemperatures of the earth are partly due to this cause. But it is now\r\ngenerally admitted that this is not the case, the reason being that all\r\nrocks and soils, in their natural compacted state, are exceedingly bad\r\nconductors of heat.\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of this is the fact, that a stream of lava often\r\ncontinues to be red hot at a few feet depth for years after the surface\r\nis consolidated, and is hardly any warmer than that of the surrounding\r\nland. A still more remarkable case is that of a glacier on the\r\nsouth-east side of the highest cone of Etna underneath a lava stream\r\nwith an intervening bed of volcanic sand only ten feet thick. This was\r\nvisited by Sir Charles Lyell in 1828, and a second time thirty years\r\nlater, when he made a very careful examination of the strata, and was\r\nquite satisfied that the sand and the lava stream together had actually\r\npreserved this mass of ice, which neither the heat of the lava above it\r\nat its first outflow, nor the continued heat rising from the great\r\nvolcano below it, had been able to melt or perceptibly to diminish in\r\nthirty years. Another fact that points in the same direction is the\r\nexistence over the whole floor of the deepest oceans of ice-cold water,\r\nwhich, originating in the polar seas, owing to its greater density sinks\r\nand creeps slowly along the ocean bottom to the depths of the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific, and is not perceptibly warmed by the internal heat of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nNow the solid crust of the earth is estimated as at least about twenty\r\nmiles in average thickness; and, keeping in mind the other facts just\r\nreferred to, we can understand that the heat from the interior passes\r\nthrough it with such extreme slowness as not to be detected at the\r\nsurface, the varying temperatures of which are due entirely to solar\r\nheat. A large portion of this heat is stored up in the surface soil, and\r\nespecially in the surface layer of the oceans and seas, thus partly\r\nequalising the temperatures of day and night, of winter and summer, so\r\nas greatly to ameliorate the rapid changes of temperature that would\r\notherwise occur. Our dense atmosphere is also of immense advantage to us\r\nas an equaliser of temperature, charged as it almost always is with a\r\nlarge quantity of water-vapour. This latter gas, when not condensed into\r\ncloud, allows the solar heat to pass freely to the earth; but it has the\r\nsingular and highly beneficial property of absorbing and retaining the\r\ndark or lower-grade heat given off by the earth which would otherwise\r\nradiate into space much more rapidly. We must therefore always remember\r\nthat, very nearly if not quite, the _whole_ of _the warmth we experience\r\non the earth is derived from the sun._[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Professor J.H. Poynting, in his lecture to the British\r\nAssociation at Cambridge in 1904, says: \"The surface of the earth\r\nreceives, we know, an amount of heat from the inside almost\r\ninfinitesimal compared with that which it receives from the sun, and on\r\nthe sun, therefore, we depend for our temperature.\"]\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the immense significance of this conclusion we\r\nmust know what is meant by the _whole_ heat or warmth; as unless we know\r\nthis we cannot define what half or any other proportion of sun-heat\r\nreally means. Now I feel pretty sure that nine out of ten of the average\r\neducated public would answer the following question incorrectly: The\r\nmean temperature of the southern half of England is about 48° F.\r\nSupposing the earth received only half the sun-heat it now receives,\r\nwhat would then be the probable mean temperature of the South of\r\nEngland? The majority would, I think, answer at once--About 24° F.\r\nNearly as many would perhaps say--48° F. is 16° above the freezing\r\npoint; therefore half the heat received would bring us down to 8° above\r\nthe freezing point, or 40° F. Very few, I think, would realise that our\r\nshare of half the amount of sun-heat received by the earth would\r\nprobably result in reducing our mean temperature to about 100° F. below\r\nthe freezing point, and perhaps even lower. This is about the very\r\nlowest temperature yet experienced on the earth's surface. To understand\r\nhow such results are obtained a few words must be said about the\r\nabsolute zero of temperature.\r\n\r\n_The Zero of Temperature._\r\n\r\nHeat is now believed to be entirely due to ether-vibration, which\r\nproduces a correspondingly rapid vibration of the molecules of matter,\r\ncausing it to expand and producing all the phenomena we term 'heat.' We\r\ncan conceive this vibration to increase indefinitely, and thus there\r\nwould appear to be no necessary limit to the amount of heat possible,\r\nbut we cannot conceive it to decrease indefinitely at the same uniform\r\nrate, as it must soon inevitably come to nothing. Now it has been found\r\nby experiment that gases under uniform pressure expand 1/273 of their\r\nvolume for each degree Centigrade of increased temperature, so that in\r\npassing from 0° C. to 273° C. they are doubled in volume. They also\r\ndecrease in volume at the same rate for each degree below 0° C. (the\r\nfreezing point of water). Hence if this goes on to-273° C. a gas will\r\nhave no volume, or it will undergo some change of nature. Hence this is\r\ncalled the zero of temperature, or the temperature to which any matter\r\nfalls which receives no heat from any other matter. It is also sometimes\r\ncalled the temperature of space, or of the ether in a state of rest, if\r\nthat is possible. All the gases have now been proved to become, first\r\nliquid and then (most of them) solid, at temperatures considerably above\r\nthis zero.\r\n\r\nThe only way to compare the proportional temperatures of bodies, whether\r\non the earth or in space, is therefore by means of a scale beginning at\r\nthis natural zero, instead of those scales founded on the artificial\r\nzero of the freezing point of water, or, as in Fahrenheit's, 32° below\r\nit. Only by using the natural zero and measuring continuously from it\r\ncan we estimate temperatures in relative proportion to the amount of\r\nheat received. This is termed the absolute zero, and so that we start\r\nreckoning from that point it does not matter whether the scale adopted\r\nis the Centigrade or that of Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n_The Complex Problem of Planetary Temperatures._\r\n\r\nNow if, as is the case with Mars, a planet receives only half the amount\r\nof solar heat that we receive, owing to its greater distance from the\r\nsun, and if the mean temperature of our earth is 60° F., this is equal\r\nto 551° F. on the absolute scale. It would therefore appear very simple\r\nto halve this amount and obtain 275.5° F. as the mean temperature of\r\nthat planet. But this result is erroneous, because the actual amount of\r\nsun heat intercepted by a planet is only one condition out of many that\r\ndetermine its resulting temperature. Radiation, that is loss of heat, is\r\ngoing on concurrently with gain, and the rate of loss varies with the\r\ntemperature according to a law recently discovered, the loss being much\r\ngreater at high temperatures in proportion to the 4th power of the\r\nabsolute temperature. Then, again, the whole heat intercepted by a\r\nplanet does not reach its surface unless it has no atmosphere. When it\r\nhas one, much is reflected or absorbed according to complex laws\r\ndependent on the density and composition of the atmosphere. Then, again,\r\nthe heat that reaches the actual surface is partly reflected and partly\r\nabsorbed, according to the nature of that surface--land or water, desert\r\nor forest or snow-clad--that part which is absorbed being the chief\r\nagent in raising the temperature of the surface and of the air in\r\ncontact with it. Very important too is the loss of heat by radiation\r\nfrom these various heated surfaces at different rates; while the\r\natmosphere itself sends back to the surface an ever varying portion of\r\nboth this radiant and reflected heat according to distinct laws. Further\r\ndifficulties arise from the fact that much of the sun's heat consists of\r\ndark or invisible rays, and it cannot therefore be measured by the\r\nquantity of light only.\r\n\r\nFrom this rough statement it will be seen that the problem is an\r\nexceedingly complex one, not to be decided off-hand, or by any simple\r\nmethod. It has in fact been usually considered as (strictly speaking)\r\ninsoluble, and only to be estimated by a more or less rough\r\napproximation, or by the method of general analogy from certain known\r\nfacts. It will be seen, from what has been said in previous chapters,\r\nthat Mr. Lowell, in his book, has used the latter method, and, by taking\r\nthe presence of water and water-vapour in Mars as proved by the\r\nbehaviour of the snow-caps and the bluish colour that results from their\r\nmelting, has deduced a temperature above the freezing point of water, as\r\nprevalent in the equatorial regions permanently, and in the temperate\r\nand arctic zones during a portion of each year.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lowell's Mathematical Investigation of the Problem._\r\n\r\nBut as this result has been held to be both improbable in itself and\r\nfounded on no valid evidence, he has now, in the _London, Edinburgh, and\r\nDublin Philosophical Magazine_ of July 1907, published an elaborate\r\npaper of 15 pages, entitled _A General Method for Evaluating the\r\nSurface-Temperatures of the Planets; with special reference to the\r\nTemperature of Mars_, by Professor Percival Lowell; and in this paper,\r\nby what purports to be strict mathematical reasoning based on the most\r\nrecent discoveries as to the laws of heat, as well as on measurements or\r\nestimates of the various elements and constants used in the\r\ncalculations, he arrives at a conclusion strikingly accordant with that\r\nput forward in the recently published volume. Having myself neither\r\nmathematical nor physical knowledge sufficient to enable me to criticise\r\nthis elaborate paper, except on a few points, I will here limit myself\r\nto giving a short account of it, so as to explain its method of\r\nprocedure; after which I may add a few notes on what seem to me doubtful\r\npoints; while I also hope to be able to give the opinions of some more\r\ncompetent critics than myself.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lowell's Mode of Estimating the Surface-temperature of Mars._\r\n\r\nThe author first states, that Professor Young, in his _General\r\nAstronomy_ (1898), makes the mean temperature of Mars 223.6° absolute,\r\nby using Newton's law of heat being radiated in proportion to\r\ntemperature, and 363° abs. (=-96° F.) by Dulong and Petit's law; but\r\nadds, that a closer determination has been made by Professor Moulton,\r\nusing Stefan's law, that radiation is as the _/4th_ power of the\r\ntemperature, whence results a mean temperature of-31° F. These estimates\r\nassume identity of atmospheric conditions of Mars and the Earth.\r\n\r\nBut as none of these estimates take account of the many complex factors\r\nwhich interfere with such direct and simple calculations, Mr. Lowell\r\nthen proceeds to enunciate them, and work out mathematically the effects\r\nthey produce:\r\n\r\n(1) The whole radiant energy of the sun on striking a planet becomes\r\ndivided as follows: Part is reflected back into space, part absorbed by\r\nthe atmosphere, part transmitted to the surface of the planet. This\r\nsurface again reflects a portion and only the balance left goes to warm\r\nthe planet.\r\n\r\n(2) To solve this complex problem we are helped by the _albedoes_ or\r\nintrinsic brilliancy of the planets, which depend on the proportion of\r\nthe visible rays which are reflected and which determines the\r\ncomparative brightness of their respective surfaces. We also have to\r\nfind the ratio of the invisible to the visible rays and the heating\r\npower of each.\r\n\r\n(3) He then refers to the actinometer and pyroheliometer, instruments\r\nfor measuring the actual heat derived from the sun, and also to the\r\nBolometer, an instrument invented by Professor Langley for measuring the\r\ninvisible heat rays, which he has proved to extend to more than three\r\ntimes the length of the whole heat-spectrum as previously known, and\r\nhas also shown that the invisible rays contribute 68 per cent, of the\r\nsun's total energy.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: For a short account of this remarkable instrument, see my\r\n_Wonderful Century_, new ed., pp. 143-145.]\r\n\r\n(4) Then follows an elaborate estimate of the loss of heat during the\r\npassage of the sun's rays through our atmosphere from experiments made\r\nat different altitudes and from the estimated reflective power of the\r\nvarious parts of the earth's surface--rocks and soil, ocean, forest and\r\nsnow--the final result being that three-fourths of the whole sun-heat\r\nis reflected back into space, forming our _albedo_, while only\r\none-fourth is absorbed by the soil and goes to warm the air and\r\ndetermine our mean temperature.\r\n\r\n(5) We now have another elaborate estimate of the comparative amounts of\r\nheat actually received by Mars and the Earth, dependent on their very\r\ndifferent amounts of atmosphere, and this estimate depends almost wholly\r\non the comparative _albedoes_, that of Mars, as observed by astronomers\r\nbeing 0.27, while ours has been estimated in a totally different way as\r\nbeing 0.75, whence he concludes that nearly three-fourths of the\r\nsun-heat that Mars receives reaches the surface and determines its\r\ntemperature, while we get only one-fourth of our total amount. Then by\r\napplying Stefan's law, that the radiation is as the 4th power of the\r\nsurface temperature, he reaches the final result that the actual heating\r\npower at the surface of Mars is considerably _more_ than on the Earth,\r\nand would produce a mean temperature of 72° F., if it were not for the\r\ngreater conservative or blanketing power of our denser and more\r\nwater-laden atmosphere. The difference produced by this latter fact he\r\nminimises by dwelling on the probability of a greater proportion of\r\ncarbonic-acid gas and water-vapour in the Martian atmosphere, and thus\r\nbrings down the mean temperature of Mars to 48° F., which is almost\r\nexactly the same as that of the southern half of England. He has also,\r\nas the result of observations, reduced the probable density of the\r\natmosphere of Mars to 2-1/2 inches of mercury, or only one-twelfth of\r\nthat of the Earth.\r\n\r\n_Critical Remarks on Mr. Lowell's Paper._\r\n\r\nThe last part of this paper, indicated under pars. 4 and 5, is the most\r\nelaborate, occupying eight pages, and it contains much that seems\r\nuncertain, if not erroneous. In particular, it seems very unlikely that\r\nunder a clear sky over the whole earth we should only receive at the\r\nsea-level 0.23 of the solar rays which the earth intercepts (p. 167).\r\nThese data largely depend on observations made in California and other\r\nparts of the southern United States, where the lower atmosphere is\r\nexceptionally dust-laden. Till we have similar observations made in the\r\ntropical forest-regions, which cover so large an area, and where the\r\natmosphere is purified by frequent rains, and also on the prairies and\r\nthe great oceans, we cannot trust these very local observations for\r\ngeneral conclusions affecting the whole earth. Later, in the same\r\narticle (p. 170), Mr. Lowell says: \"Clouds transmit approximately 20 per\r\ncent. of the heat reaching them: a clear sky at sea-level 60 per cent.\r\nAs the sky is half the time cloudy the mean transmission is 35 per\r\ncent.\" These statements seem incompatible with that quoted above.\r\n\r\nThe figure he uses in his calculations for the actual albedo of the\r\nearth, 0.75, is also not only improbable, but almost self-contradictory,\r\nbecause the albedo of cloud is 0.72, and that of the great cloud-covered\r\nplanet, Jupiter, is given by Lowell as 0.75, while Zollner made it only\r\n0.62. Again, Lowell gives Venus an albedo of 0.92, while Zollner made it\r\nonly 0.50 and Mr. Gore 0.65. This shows the extreme uncertainty of these\r\nestimates, while the fact that both Venus and Jupiter are wholly\r\ncloud-covered, while we are only half-covered, renders it almost\r\ncertain that our albedo is far less than Mr. Lowell makes it. It is\r\nevident that mathematical calculations founded upon such uncertain data\r\ncannot yield trustworthy results. But this is by no means the only case\r\nin which the data employed in this paper are of uncertain value.\r\nEverywhere we meet with figures of somewhat doubtful accuracy. Here we\r\nhave somebody's 'estimate' quoted, there another person's 'observation,'\r\nand these are adopted without further remark and used in the various\r\ncalculations leading to the result above quoted. It requires a practised\r\nmathematician, and one fully acquainted with the extensive literature of\r\nthis subject, to examine these various data, and track them through the\r\nmaze of formulae and figures so as to determine to what extent they\r\naffect the final result.\r\n\r\nThere is however one curious oversight which I must refer to, as it is a\r\npoint to which I have given much attention. Not only does Mr. Lowell\r\nassume, as in his book, that the 'snows' of Mars consist of frozen\r\nwater, and that therefore there _is_ water on its surface and\r\nwater-vapour in its atmosphere, not only does he ignore altogether Dr.\r\nJohnstone Stoney's calculations with regard to it, which I have already\r\nreferred to, but he uses terms that imply that water-vapour is one of\r\nthe heavier components of our atmosphere. The passage is at p. 168 of\r\nthe _Philosophical Magazine._ After stating that, owing to the very\r\nsmall barometric pressure in Mars, water would boil at 110° F., he adds:\r\n\"The sublimation at lower temperatures would be correspondingly\r\nincreased. Consequently the amount of water-vapour in the Martian air\r\nmust on that score be relatively greater than our own.\" Then follows\r\nthis remarkable passage: \"Carbon-dioxide, because of its greater\r\nspecific gravity, would also be in relatively greater amount so far as\r\nthis cause is considered. For the planet would part, _caeteris paribus_,\r\nwith its lighter gases the quickest. Whence as regards both water-vapour\r\nand carbon-dioxide we have reason to think them in relatively greater\r\nquantity than in our own air at corresponding barometric pressure.\" I\r\ncannot understand this passage except as implying that 'water-vapour and\r\ncarbon-dioxide' are among the heavier and not among the lighter gases of\r\nthe atmosphere--those which the planet 'parts with quickest.' But this\r\nis just what water-vapour _is_, being a little less than two-thirds the\r\nweight of air (0.6225), and one of those which the planet _would_ part\r\nwith the quickest, and which, according to Dr. Johnstone Stoney, it\r\nloses altogether.\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNote on Professor Lowell's article in the _Philosophical Magazine_; by\r\nJ.H. Poynting, F.R.S., Professor of Physics in the University of\r\nBirmingham.\r\n\r\n\"I think Professor Lowell's results are erroneous through his neglect of\r\nthe heat stored in the air by its absorption of radiation both from the\r\nsun and from the surface. The air thus heated radiates to the surface\r\nand keeps up the temperature. I have sent to the _Philosophical\r\nMagazine_ a paper in which I think it is shown that when the radiation\r\nby the atmosphere is taken into account the results are entirely\r\nchanged. The temperature of Mars, with Professor Lowell's data, still\r\ncomes out far below the freezing-point--still further below than the\r\nincreased distance alone would make it. Indeed, the lower temperature on\r\nelevated regions of the earth's surface would lead us to expect this. I\r\nthink it is impossible to raise the temperature of Mars to anything like\r\nthe value obtained by Professor Lowell, unless we assume some quality in\r\nhis atmosphere entirely different from any found in our own atmosphere.\"\r\nJ.H. POYNTING. October 19, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW ESTIMATE OF THE TEMPERATURE OF MARS.\r\n\r\nWhen we are presented with a complex problem depending on a great number\r\nof imperfectly ascertained data, we may often check the results thus\r\nobtained by the comparison of cases in which some of the more important\r\nof these data are identical, while others are at a maximum or a minimum.\r\nIn the present case we can do this by a consideration of the Moon as\r\ncompared with the Earth and with Mars.\r\n\r\n_Langley's Determination of the Moon's Temperature._\r\n\r\nIn the moon we see the conditions that prevail in Mars both exaggerated\r\nand simplified. Mars has a very scanty atmosphere, the moon none at all,\r\nor if there is one it is so excessively scanty that the most refined\r\nobservations have not detected it. All the complications arising from\r\nthe possible nature of the atmosphere, and its complex effects upon\r\nreflection, absorption, and radiation are thus eliminated. The mean\r\ndistance of the moon from the sun being identical with that of the\r\nearth, the total amount of heat intercepted must also be identical; only\r\nin this case the whole of it reaches the surface instead of one-fourth\r\nonly, according to Mr. Lowell's estimate for the earth.\r\n\r\nNow, by the most refined observations with his Bolometer, Mr. Langley\r\nwas able to determine the temperature of the moon's surface exposed to\r\nundimmed sunshine for fourteen days together; and he found that, even in\r\nthat portion of it on which the sun was shining almost vertically, the\r\ntemperature rarely rose above the freezing point of water. However\r\nextraordinary this result may seem, it is really a striking confirmation\r\nof the accuracy of the general laws determining temperature which I have\r\nendeavoured to explain in the preceding chapter. For the same surface\r\nwhich has had fourteen days of sunshine has also had a preceding\r\nfourteen days of darkness, during which the heat which it had\r\naccumulated in its surface layers would have been lost by free radiation\r\ninto stellar space. It thus acquires during its day a maximum\r\ntemperature of only 491° F. absolute, while its minimum, after 14 days'\r\ncontinuous radiation, must be very low, and is, with much reason,\r\nsupposed to approach the absolute zero.\r\n\r\n_Rapid Loss of Heat by Radiation on the Earth._\r\n\r\nIn order better to comprehend what this minimum may be under extreme\r\nconditions, it will be useful to take note of the effects it actually\r\nproduces on the earth in places where the conditions are nearest to\r\nthose existing on the moon or on Mars, though never quite equalling, or\r\neven approaching very near them. It is in our great desert regions, and\r\nespecially on high plateaux, that extreme aridity prevails, and it is in\r\nsuch districts that the differences between day and night temperatures\r\nreach their maximum. It is stated by geographers that in parts of the\r\nGreat Sahara the surface temperature is sometimes 150° F., while during\r\nthe night it falls nearly or quite to the freezing point--a difference\r\nof 118 degrees in little more than 12 hours.[10] In the high desert\r\nplains of Central Asia the extremes are said to be even greater.[11]\r\nAgain, in his _Universal Geography_, Reclus states that in the Armenian\r\nHighlands the thermometer oscillates between 13° F. and 112°F. We may\r\ntherefore, without any fear of exaggeration, take it as proved that a\r\nfall of 100° F. in twelve or fifteen hours not infrequently occurs where\r\nthere is a very dry and clear atmosphere permitting continuous\r\ninsolation by day and rapid radiation by night.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Keith Johnston's 'Africa' in _Stanford's Compendium._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Chambers's Encyclopaedia_, Art. 'Deserts.']\r\n\r\nNow, as it is admitted that our dense atmosphere, however dry and clear,\r\nabsorbs and reflects some considerable portion of the solar heat, we\r\nshall certainly underestimate the radiation from the moon's surface\r\nduring its long night if we take as the basis of our calculation a\r\nlowering of temperature amounting to 100° F. during twelve hours, as not\r\nunfrequently occurs with us. Using these data--with Stefan's law of\r\ndecrease of radiation as the 4th power of the temperature--a\r\nmathematical friend finds that the temperature of the moon's surface\r\nwould be reduced during the lunar night to nearly 200° F. absolute\r\n(equal to-258° F.).\r\n\r\n_More Rapid Loss of Heat by the Moon._\r\n\r\nAlthough such a calculation as the above may afford us a good\r\napproximation to the rate of loss of heat by Mars with its very scanty\r\natmosphere, we have now good evidence that in the case of the moon the\r\nloss is much more rapid. Two independent workers have investigated this\r\nsubject with very accordant results--Dr. Boeddicker, with Lord Rosse's\r\n3-foot reflector and a Thermopile to measure the heat, and Mr. Frank\r\nVery, with a glass reflector of 12 inches diameter and the Bolometer\r\ninvented by Mr. Langley. The very striking and unexpected fact in which\r\nthese observers agree is the sudden disappearance of much of the\r\nstored-up heat during the comparatively short duration of a total\r\neclipse of the moon--less than two hours of complete darkness, and about\r\ntwice that period of partial obscuration.\r\n\r\nDr. Boeddicker was unable to detect any appreciable heat at the period\r\nof greatest obscuration; but, owing to the extreme sensitiveness of the\r\nBolometer, Mr. Very ascertained that those parts of the surface which\r\nhad been longest in the shadow still emitted heat \"to the amount of one\r\nper cent. of the heat to be expected from the full moon.\" This however\r\nis the amount of radiation measured by the Bolometer, and to get the\r\ntemperature of the radiating surface we must apply Stefan's law of the\r\n4th power. Hence the temperature of the moon's dark surface will be the\r\n[fourth root of (1 over 100)] = 1 over 3.2 [A] of the highest temperature\r\n (which we may take at the freezing-point, 491° F. abs.), or 154° F. abs.,\r\n just below the liquefaction point of air. This is about 50° lower than the\r\namount found by calculation from our most rapid radiation; and as this\r\namount is produced in a few hours, it is not too much to expect that,\r\nwhen continued for more than two weeks (the lunar night), it might reach\r\na temperature sufficient to liquefy hydrogen (60° F. abs.), or perhaps\r\neven below it.\r\n\r\n[Note A: LaTex markup $\\root 4  \\of {1 \\over 100}  = {1 \\over 3.2}$  ]\r\n\r\n_Theory of the Moon's Origin._\r\n\r\nThis extremely rapid loss of heat by radiation, at first sight so\r\nimprobable as to be almost incredible, may perhaps be to some extent\r\nexplained by the physical constitution of the moon's surface, which,\r\nfrom a theoretical point of view, does not appear to have received the\r\nattention it deserves. It is clear that our satellite has been long\r\nsubjected to volcanic eruptions over its whole visible face, and these\r\nhave evidently been of an explosive nature, so as to build up the very\r\nlofty cones and craters, as well as thousands of smaller ones, which,\r\nowing to the absence of any degrading or denuding agencies, have\r\nremained piled up as they were first formed.\r\n\r\nThis highly volcanic structure can, I think, be well explained by an\r\norigin such as that attributed to it by Sir George Darwin, and which has\r\nbeen so well described by Sir Robert Ball in his small volume, _Time and\r\nTide._ These astronomers adduce strong evidence that the earth once\r\nrotated so rapidly that the equatorial protuberance was almost at the\r\npoint of separation from the planet as a ring. Before this occurred,\r\nhowever, the tension was so great that one large portion of the\r\nprotuberance where it was weakest broke away, and began to move around\r\nthe earth at some considerable distance from it. As about 1/50 of the\r\nbulk of the earth thus escaped, it must have consisted of a considerable\r\nportion of the solid crust and a much larger quantity of the liquid or\r\nsemi-liquid interior, together with a proportionate amount of the gases\r\nwhich we know formed, and still form, an important part of the earth's\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nAs the surface layers of the earth must have been the lightest, they\r\nwould necessarily, when broken up by this gigantic convulsion, have come\r\ntogether to form the exterior of the new satellite, and be soon adjusted\r\nby the forces of gravity and tidal disturbance into a more or less\r\nirregular spheroidal form, all whose interstices and cavities would be\r\nfilled up and connected together by the liquid or semi-liquid mass\r\nforced up between them. Thence-forward, as the moon increased its\r\ndistance and reduced its time of rotation, in the way explained by Sir\r\nRobert Ball, there would necessarily commence a process of escape of the\r\nimprisoned gases at every fissure and at all points and lines of\r\nweakness, giving rise to numerous volcanic outlets, which, being\r\nsubjected only to the small force of lunar gravity (only one-sixth that\r\nof the earth), would, in the course of ages, pile up those gigantic\r\ncones and ridges which form its great characteristic.\r\n\r\nBut this small gravitative power of the moon would prevent its retaining\r\non its surface any of the gases forming our atmosphere, which would all\r\nescape from it and probably be recaptured by the earth. By no process of\r\nexternal aggregation of solid matter to such a relatively small amount\r\nas that forming the moon, even if the aggregation was so violent as to\r\nproduce heat enough to cause liquefaction, could any such\r\nlong-continued volcanic action arise by gradual cooling, in the absence\r\nof internal gases. There might be fissures, and even some outflows of\r\nmolten rock; but without imprisoned gases, and especially without water\r\nand water-vapour producing explosive outbursts, could any such amount of\r\nscoriae and ashes be produced as were necessary for the building up of\r\nthe vast volcanic cones, craters, and craterlets we see upon the moon's\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nI am not aware that either Sir Robert Ball or Sir George Darwin have\r\nadduced this highly volcanic condition of the moon's surface as a\r\nphenomenon which can _only_ be explained by our satellite having been\r\nthrown off a very much larger body, whose gravitative force was\r\nsufficient to acquire and retain the enormous quantity of gases and of\r\nwater which we possess, and which are _absolutely essential_ for that\r\n_special form of cone-building volcanic action_ which the moon exhibits\r\nin so pre-eminent a degree. Yet it seems to me clear, that some such\r\nhypothetical origin for our satellite would have had to be assumed if\r\nSir George Darwin had not deduced it by means of purely mathematical\r\nargument based upon astronomical facts.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the problem of the moon's temperature, I think the\r\nphenomena this presents may be in part due to the mode of formation here\r\ndescribed. For, its entire surface being the result of long-continued\r\ngaseous explosions, all the volcanic products--scoriae, pumice, and\r\nashes--would necessarily be highly porous throughout; and, never having\r\nbeen compacted by water-action, as on the earth, and there having been\r\nno winds to carry the finer dust so as to fill up their pores and\r\nfissures, the whole of the surface material to a very considerable depth\r\nmust be loose and porous to a high degree. This condition has been\r\nfurther increased owing to the small power of gravity and the extreme\r\nirregularity of the surface, consisting very largely of lofty cones and\r\nridges very loosely piled up to enormous heights.\r\n\r\nNow this condition of the substance of the moon's surface is such as\r\nwould produce a high specific heat, so that it would absorb a large\r\namount of heat in proportion to the rise of temperature produced, the\r\nheat being conducted downwards to a considerable depth. Owing, however,\r\nto the total absence of atmosphere radiation would very rapidly cool the\r\nsurface, but afterwards more slowly, both on account of the action of\r\nStefan's law and because the heat stored up in the deeper portions could\r\nbe carried to the surface by conduction only, and with extreme slowness.\r\n\r\n_Very's Researches on the Moon's Heat._\r\n\r\nThe results of the eclipse observations are supported by the detailed\r\nexamination of the surface-temperature of the moon by Mr. Very in his\r\n_Prize Essay on the Distribution of the Moon's Heat_ (published by the\r\nUtrecht Society of Arts and Sciences in 1891). He shows, by a diagram of\r\nthe 'Phase-curve,' that at the commencement of the Lunar day the surface\r\njust within the illuminated limb has acquired about 1/7 of its maximum\r\ntemperature, or about 70° F. abs. As the surface exposed to the\r\nBolometer at each observation is about 1/30 of the moon's surface, and\r\nin order to ensure accuracy the instrument has to be directed to a spot\r\nlying wholly within the edge of the moon, it is evident that the surface\r\nmeasured has already been for several hours exposed to oblique sunshine.\r\nThe curve of temperature then rises gradually and afterwards more\r\nrapidly, till it attains its maximum (of about +30 to 40° F.) a few\r\nhours _before_ noon. This, Mr. Very thinks, is due to the fact that the\r\nhalf of the moon's face first illuminated for us has, on the average, a\r\ndarker surface than that of the afternoon, or second quarter, during\r\nwhich the curve descends not quite so rapidly, the temperature near\r\nsunset being only a little higher than that near sunrise. This rapid\r\nfall while exposed to oblique sunshine is quite in harmony with the\r\nrapid loss of heat during the few hours of darkness during an eclipse,\r\nboth showing the prepotency of radiation over insolation on the moon.\r\n\r\nTwo other diagrams show the distribution of heat at the time of\r\nfull-moon, one half of the curve showing the temperatures along the\r\nequator from the edge of the disc to the centre, the other along a\r\nmeridian from this centre to the pole. This diagram (here reproduced)\r\nexhibits the quick rise of temperature of the oblique rim of the moon\r\nand the nearly uniform heat of the central half of its surface; the\r\ndiminution of heat towards the pole, however, is slower for the first\r\nhalf and more rapid for the latter portion.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that the temperature near the margin of the\r\nfull-moon increases towards the centre more rapidly than it does when\r\nthe same parts are observed during the early phases of the first\r\nquarter. Mr. Very explains this difference as being due to the fact that\r\nthe full-moon to its very edges is fully illuminated, all the shadows of\r\nthe ridges and mountains being thrown vertically or obliquely _behind\r\nthem._ We thus measure the heat reflected from the _whole_ visible\r\nsurface. But at new moon, and somewhat beyond the first quarter, the\r\ndeep shadows thrown by the smallest cones and ridges, as well as by the\r\nloftiest mountains, cover a considerable portion of the visible surface,\r\nthus largely reducing the quantity of light and heat reflected or\r\nradiated in our direction. It is only at the full, therefore, that the\r\nmaximum temperature of the whole lunar surface can be measured. It must\r\nbe considered a proof of the delicacy of the heat-measuring instruments\r\nthat this difference in the curves of temperature of the different parts\r\nof the moon's surface and under different conditions is so clearly\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n_The Application of the Preceding Results to the Case of Mars._\r\n\r\nThis somewhat lengthy account of the actual state of the moon's surface\r\nand temperature is of very great importance in our present enquiry,\r\nbecause it shows us the extraordinary difference in mean and extreme\r\ntemperatures of two bodies situated at the same distance from the sun,\r\nand therefore receiving exactly the same amount of solar heat per unit\r\nof surface. We have learned also what are the main causes of this almost\r\nincredible difference, namely: (1) a remarkably rugged surface with\r\nporous and probably cavernous rock-texture, leading to extremely rapid\r\nradiation of heat in the one; as compared with a comparatively even and\r\nwell-compacted surface largely clad with vegetation, leading to\r\ncomparatively slow and gradual loss by radiation in the other: and (2),\r\nthese results being greatly intensified by the total absence of a\r\nprotecting atmosphere in the former, while a dense and cloudy atmosphere\r\nwith an ever-present supply of water-vapour, accumulates and equalises\r\nthe heat received by the latter.\r\n\r\nThe only other essential difference in the two bodies which may possibly\r\naid in the production of this marvellous result, is the fact of our day\r\nand night having a mean length of 12 hours, while those of the moon are\r\nabout 14-1/2 of our days. But the altogether unexpected fact, in which\r\ntwo independent enquirers agree, that during the few hours' duration of\r\na total eclipse of the moon so large a proportion of the heat is lost by\r\nradiation renders it almost certain that the resulting low temperature\r\nwould be not very much less if the moon had a day and night the same\r\nlength as our own.\r\n\r\nThe great lesson we learn by this extreme contrast of conditions\r\nsupplied to us by nature, as if to enable us to solve some of her\r\nproblems, is, the overwhelming importance, first, of a dense and\r\nwell-compacted surface, due to water-action and strong gravitative\r\nforce; secondly, of a more or less general coat of vegetation; and,\r\nthirdly, of a dense vapour-laden atmosphere. These three favourable\r\nconditions result in a mean temperature of about +60° F. with a range\r\nseldom exceeding 40° above or below it, while over more than half the\r\nland-surface of the earth the temperature rarely falls below the\r\nfreezing point. On the other hand, we have a globe of the same materials\r\nand at the same distance from the sun, with a maximum temperature of\r\nfreezing water, and a minimum not very far from the absolute zero, the\r\nmonthly mean being probably much below the freezing point of\r\ncarbonic-acid gas--a difference entirely due to the absence of these\r\nthree favourable conditions.\r\n\r\n_The Special Features of Mars as influencing Temperature._\r\n\r\nComing now to the special feature of Mars and its probable temperature,\r\nwe find that most writers have arrived at a very different conclusion\r\nfrom that of Mr. Lowell, who himself quotes Mr. Moulton as an authority\r\nwho 'recently, by the application of Stefan's law,' has found the mean\r\ntemperature of this planet to be-35° F. Again, Professor J.H. Poynting,\r\nin his lecture on 'Radiation in the Solar System,' delivered before the\r\nBritish Association at Cambridge in 1904, gave an estimate of the mean\r\ntemperature of the planets, arrived at from measurements of the sun's\r\nemissive power and the application of Stefan's law to the distances of\r\nthe several planets, and he thus finds the earth to have a mean\r\ntemperature of 17° C. (=62-1/2° F.) and Mars one of-38° C. (=-36-1/2°\r\nF.), a wonderfully close approximation to the mean temperature of the\r\nearth as determined by direct measurement, and therefore, presumably, an\r\nequally near approximation to that of Mars as dependent on distance from\r\nthe sun, and '_on the supposition that it is earth-like in all its\r\nconditions._'\r\n\r\nBut we know that it is far from being earth-like in the very conditions\r\nwhich we have found to be those which determine the extremely different\r\ntemperatures of the earth, and moon; and, as regards each of these, we\r\nshall find that, so far as it differs from the earth, it approximates to\r\nthe less favourable conditions that prevail in the moon. The first of\r\nthese conditions which we have found to be essential in regulating the\r\nabsorption and radiation of heat, and thus raising the mean temperature\r\nof a planet, is a compact surface well covered with vegetation, two\r\nconditions arising from, and absolutely dependent on, an ample amount of\r\nwater. But Mr. Lowell himself assures us, as a fact of which he has no\r\ndoubt, that there are no permanent bodies of water, great or small, upon\r\nMars; that rain, and consequently rivers, are totally wanting; that its\r\nsky is almost constantly clear, and that what appear to be clouds are\r\nnot formed of water-vapour but of dust. He dwells, emphatically, on the\r\nterrible desert conditions of the greater part of the surface of the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nThat being the case now, we have no right to assume that it has ever\r\nbeen otherwise; and, taking full account of the fact, neither denied nor\r\ndisputed by Mr. Lowell, that the force of gravity on Mars is not\r\nsufficient to retain water-vapour in its atmosphere, we must conclude\r\nthat the surface of that planet, like that of the moon, has been moulded\r\nby some form of volcanic action modified probably by wind, but not by\r\nwater. Adding to this, that the force of gravity on Mars is nearer that\r\nof the moon than to that of the earth, and we may r reasonably conclude\r\nthat its surface is formed of volcanic matter in a light and porous\r\ncondition, and therefore highly favourable for the rapid loss of surface\r\nheat by radiation. The surface-conditions of Mars are therefore,\r\npresumably, much more like those of the moon than like those of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe next condition favourable to the storing up of heat--a covering of\r\nvegetation--is almost certainly absent from Mars except, possibly, over\r\nlimited areas and for short periods. In this feature also the surface of\r\nMars approximates much nearer to lunar than to earth-conditions. The\r\nthird condition--a dense, vapour-laden atmosphere--is also wanting in\r\nMars. For although it possesses an atmosphere it is estimated by Mr.\r\nLowell (in his latest article) to have a pressure equivalent to only\r\n2-1/2 inches of mercury with us, giving it a density of only one-twelfth\r\npart that of ours; while aqueous vapour, the chief accumulator of heat,\r\ncannot permanently exist in it, and, notwithstanding repeated\r\nspectroscopic observations for the purpose of detecting it, has never\r\nbeen proved to exist.\r\n\r\nI submit that I have now shown from the statements--and largely as the\r\nresult of the long-continued observations--of Mr. Lowell himself, that,\r\nso far as the physical conditions of Mars are known to differ from those\r\nof the earth, the differences are all _unfavourable_ to the conservation\r\nand _favourable_ to the dissipation of the scanty heat it receives from\r\nthe sun--that they point unmistakeably towards the temperature\r\nconditions of the moon rather than to those of the earth, and that the\r\ncumulative effect of these adverse conditions, acting upon a\r\nheat-supply, reduced by solar distance to less than one-half of ours,\r\n_must_ result in a mean temperature (as well as in the extremes) nearer\r\nto that of our satellite than to that of our own earth.\r\n\r\n_Further Criticism of Mr. Lowell's Article._\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to test some further conclusions of Mr.\r\nLowell's _Phil. Mag._ article by comparison with actual phenomena. We\r\nhave seen, in the outline I have given of this article, that he\r\nendeavours to show how the small amount of solar heat received by Mars\r\nis counterbalanced, largely by the greater transparency to light and\r\nheat of its thin and cloudless atmosphere, and partially also by a\r\ngreater conservative or 'blanketing' power of its atmosphere due to the\r\npresence in it of a large proportion of carbonic acid gas and aqueous\r\nvapour. The first of these statements may be admitted as a fact which he\r\nis entitled to dwell upon, but the second--the presence of large\r\nquantities of carbon-dioxide and aqueous vapour is a pure hypothesis\r\nunsupported by any item of scientific evidence, while in the case of\r\naqueous vapour it is directly opposed to admitted results founded upon\r\nthe molecular theory of gaseous elasticity. But, although Mr. Lowell\r\nrefers to the conservative or 'blanketing' effect of the earth's\r\natmosphere, he does not consider or allow for its very great cumulative\r\neffect, as is strikingly shown by the comparison with the actual\r\ntemperature conditions of the moon. This cumulative effect is due to the\r\n_continuous_ reflection and radiation of heat from the clouds as well as\r\nfrom the vapour-laden strata of air in our lower atmosphere, which\r\nlatter, though very transparent to the luminous and accompanying heat\r\nrays of the sun, are opaque to the dark heat-rays whether radiated or\r\nreflected from the earth's surface. We are therefore in a position\r\nstrictly comparable with that of the interior of some huge glass house,\r\nwhich not only becomes intensely heated by the direct rays of the sun,\r\nbut also to a less degree by reflected rays from the sky and those\r\nradiated from the clouds, so that even on a cloudy or misty day its\r\ntemperature rises many degrees above that of the outer air. Such a\r\nbuilding, if of large size, of suitable form, and well protected at\r\nnight by blinds or other covering, might be so arranged as to accumulate\r\nheat in its soil and walls so as to maintain a tolerably uniform\r\ntemperature though exposed to a considerable range of external heat and\r\ncold. It is to such a power of accumulation of heat in our soil and\r\nlower atmosphere that we must impute the overwhelming contrast between\r\nour climate and that of the moon. With us, the solar heat that\r\npenetrates our vapour-laden and cloudy atmosphere is shut in by that\r\nsame atmosphere, accumulates there for weeks and months together, and\r\ncan only slowly escape. It is this great cumulative power which Mr.\r\nLowell has not taken account of, while he certainly has not estimated\r\nthe enormous loss of heat by free radiation, which entirely neutralises\r\nthe effects of increase of sun-heat, however great, when these\r\ncumulative agencies are not present.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The effects of this 'cumulative' power of a dense\r\natmosphere are further discussed and illustrated in the last chapter of\r\nthis book, where I show that the universal fact of steadily diminishing\r\ntemperatures at high altitudes is due solely to the diminution of this\r\ncumulative power of our atmosphere, and that from this cause alone the\r\ntemperature of Mars must be that which would be found on a lofty plateau\r\nabout 18,000 feet higher than the average of the peaks of the Andes!]\r\n\r\n_Temperature on Polar Regions of Mars._\r\n\r\nThere is also a further consideration which I think Mr. Lowell has\r\naltogether omitted to discuss. Whatever may be the _mean_ temperature\r\nof Mars, we must take account of the long nights in its polar and\r\nhigh-temperate latitudes, lasting nearly twice as long as ours, with the\r\nresulting lowering of temperature by radiation into a constantly clear\r\nsky. Even in Siberia, in Lat. 67-1/2°N. a cold of-88°F. has been\r\nattained; while over a large portion of N. Asia and America above 60°\r\nLat. the _mean_ January temperature is from-30°F. to-60°F., and the\r\nwhole subsoil is permanently frozen from a depth of 6 or 7 feet to\r\nseveral hundreds. But the winter temperatures, _over the same latitudes_\r\nin Mars, must be very much lower; and it must require a proportionally\r\nlarger amount of its feeble sun-heat to raise the surface even to the\r\nfreezing-point, and an additional very large amount to melt any\r\nconsiderable depth of snow. But this identical area, from a little below\r\n60° to the pole, is that occupied by the snow-caps of Mars, and over the\r\nwhole of it the winter temperature must be far lower than the\r\nearth-minimum of-88°F. Then, as the Martian summer comes on, there is\r\nless than half the sun-heat available to raise this low temperature\r\nafter a winter nearly double the length of ours. And when the summer\r\ndoes come with its scanty sun-heat, that heat is not accumulated as it\r\nis by our dense and moisture-laden atmosphere, the marvellous effects of\r\nwhich we have already shown. Yet with all these adverse conditions, each\r\nassisting the other to produce a climate approximating to that which the\r\nearth would have if it had no atmosphere (but retaining our superiority\r\nover Mars in receiving double the amount of sun-heat), we are asked to\r\naccept a mean temperature for the more distant planet almost exactly the\r\nsame as that of mild and equable southern England, and a disappearance\r\nof the vast snowfields of its polar regions as rapid and complete as\r\nwhat occurs with us! If the moon, even at its equator, has not its\r\ntemperature raised above the freezing-point of water, how can the more\r\n_distant_ Mars, with its _oblique_ noon-day sun falling upon the\r\nsnow-caps, receive heat enough, first to raise their temperature to 32°\r\nF., and then to melt with marked rapidity the vast frozen plains of its\r\npolar regions?\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell is however so regardless of the ordinary teachings of\r\nmeteorological science that he actually accounts for the supposed mild\r\nclimate of the polar regions of Mars by the absence of water on its\r\nsurface and in its atmosphere. He concludes his fifth chapter with the\r\nfollowing words: \"Could our earth but get rid of its oceans, we too\r\nmight have temperate regions stretching to the poles.\" Here he runs\r\ncounter to two of the best-established laws of terrestrial climatology--\r\nthe wonderful equalising effects of warm ocean-currents which are the\r\nchief agents in diminishing polar cold; the equally striking effects of\r\nwarm moist winds derived from these oceans, and the great storehouse of\r\nheat we possess in our vapour-laden atmosphere, its vapour being\r\nprimarily derived from these same oceans! But, in Mr. Lowell's opinion,\r\nall our meteorologists are quite mistaken. Our oceans are our great\r\ndrawbacks. Only get rid of them and we should enjoy the exquisite\r\nclimate of Mars--with its absence of clouds and fog, of rain or rivers,\r\nand its delightful expanses of perennial deserts, varied towards the\r\npoles by a scanty snow-fall in winter, the melting of which might, with\r\ngreat care, supply us with the necessary moisture to grow wheat and\r\ncabbages for about one-tenth, or more likely one-hundredth, of our\r\npresent population. I hope I may be excused for not treating such an\r\nargument seriously. The various considerations now advanced, especially\r\nthose which show the enormous cumulative and conservative effect of our\r\ndense and water-laden atmosphere, and the disastrous effect--judging by\r\nthe actual condition of the moon--which the loss of it would have upon\r\nour temperature, seem to me quite sufficient to demonstrate important\r\nerrors in the data or fallacies in the complex mathematical argument by\r\nwhich Mr. Lowell has attempted to uphold his views as to the temperature\r\nand consequent climatic conditions of Mars. In concluding this portion\r\nof my discussion of the problem of Mars, I wish to call attention to the\r\nfact that my argument, founded upon a comparison of the physical\r\nconditions of the earth and moon with those of Mars, is dependent upon a\r\nsmall number of generally admitted scientific facts; while the\r\nconclusions drawn from those facts are simple and direct, requiring no\r\nmathematical knowledge to follow them, or to appreciate their weight and\r\ncogency. I claim for them, therefore, that they are in no degree\r\nspeculative, but in their data and methods exclusively scientific. In\r\nthe next chapter I will put forward a suggestion as to how the very\r\ncurious markings upon the surface of Mars may possibly be interpreted,\r\nso as to be in harmony with the planet's actual physical condition and\r\nits not improbable origin and past history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUGGESTION AS TO THE 'CANALS' OF MARS.\r\n\r\nThe special characteristics of the numerous lines which intersect the\r\nwhole of the equatorial and temperate regions of Mars are, their\r\nstraightness combined with their enormous length. It is this which has\r\nled Mr. Lowell to term them 'non-natural features.' Schiaparelli, in his\r\nearlier drawings, showed them curved and of comparatively great width.\r\nLater, he found them to be straight fine lines when seen under the best\r\nconditions, just as Mr. Lowell has always seen them in the pure\r\natmosphere of his observatory. Both of these observers were at first\r\ndoubtful of their reality, but persistent observation continued at many\r\nsuccessive oppositions compelled acceptance of them as actual features\r\nof the planet's disc. So many other observers have now seen them that\r\nthe objection of unreality seems no longer valid.\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell urges, however, that their perfect straightness, their\r\nextreme tenuity, their uniformity throughout their whole length, the\r\ndual character of many of them, their relation to the 'oases' and the\r\nform and position of these round black spots, are all proofs of\r\nartificiality and are suggestive of design. And considering that some of\r\nthem are actually as long as from Boston to San Francisco, and\r\nrelatively to their globe as long as from London to Bombay, his\r\nobjection that \"no natural phenomena within our knowledge show such\r\nregularity on such a scale\" seems, at first, a mighty one.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that we can point to nothing exactly like them\r\neither on the earth or on the moon, and these are the only two planetary\r\nbodies we are in a position to compare with Mars. Yet even these do, I\r\nthink, afford us some hints towards an interpretation of the mysterious\r\nlines. But as our knowledge of the internal structure and past history\r\neven of our earth is still imperfect, that of the moon only conjectural,\r\nand that of Mars a perfect blank, it is not perhaps surprising that the\r\nsurface-features of the latter do not correspond with those of either of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Pickering's Suggestion._\r\n\r\nThe best clue to a natural interpretation of the strange features of the\r\nsurface of Mars is that suggested by the American astronomer Mr. W.H.\r\nPickering in _Popular Astronomy_ (1904). Briefly it is, that both the\r\n'canals' of Mars and the rifts as well as the luminous streaks on the\r\nmoon are cracks in the volcanic crust, caused by internal stresses due\r\nto the action of the heated interior. These cracks he considers to be\r\nsymmetrically arranged with regard to small 'craterlets' (Mr. Lowell's\r\n'oases') because they have originated from them, just as the white\r\nstreaks on the moon radiate from the larger craters as centres. He\r\nfurther supposes that water and carbon-dioxide issue from the interior\r\ninto these fissures, and, in conjunction with sunlight, promote the\r\ngrowth of vegetation. Owing to the very rare atmosphere, the vapours, he\r\nthinks, would not ascend but would roll down the outsides of the\r\ncraterlets and along the borders of the canals, thus irrigating the\r\nimmediate vicinity and serving to promote the growth of some form of\r\nvegetation which renders the canals and oases visible.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Nature_, vol. 70, p. 536.]\r\n\r\nThis opinion is especially important because, next to Mr. Lowell, Mr.\r\nPickering is perhaps the astronomer who has given most attention to Mars\r\nduring the last fifteen years. He was for some time at Flagstaff with\r\nMr. Lowell, and it was he who discovered the oases or craterlets, and\r\nwho originated the idea that we did not see the 'canals' themselves but\r\nonly the vegetable growth on their borders. He also observed Mars in the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere at Arequipa; and he has since made an elaborate\r\nstudy of the moon by means of a specially constructed telescope of 135\r\nfeet focal length, which produced a direct image on photographic plates\r\nnearly 16 inches in diameter.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Nature_, vol. 70, May 5, p.xi, supplement.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear therefore that Mr. Lowell's views as to the artificial\r\nnature of the 'canals' of Mars are not accepted by an astronomer of\r\nequal knowledge and still wider experience. Yet Professor Pickering's\r\nalternative view is more a suggestion than an explanation, because there\r\nis no attempt to account for the enormous length and perfect\r\nstraightness of the lines on Mars, so different from anything that is\r\nfound either on our earth or on the moon. There must evidently be some\r\ngreat peculiarity of structure or of conditions on Mars to account for\r\nthese features, and I shall now attempt to point out what this\r\npeculiarity is and how it may have arisen.\r\n\r\n_The Meteoritic Hypothesis._\r\n\r\nDuring the last quarter of a century a considerable change has come over\r\nthe opinions of astronomers as regards the probable origin of the Solar\r\nSystem. The large amount of knowledge of the stellar universe, and\r\nespecially of nebulae, of comets and of meteor-streams which we now\r\npossess, together with many other phenomena, such as the constitution of\r\nSaturn's rings, the great number and extent of the minor planets, and\r\ngenerally of the vast amount of matter in the form of meteor-rings and\r\nmeteoric dust in and around our system, have all pointed to a different\r\norigin for the planets and their satellites than that formulated by\r\nLaplace as the Nebular hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIt is now seen more clearly than at any earlier period, that most of the\r\nplanets possess special characteristics which distinguish them from one\r\nanother, and that such an origin as Laplace suggested--the slow cooling\r\nand contraction of one vast sun-mist or nebula, besides presenting\r\ninherent difficulties--many think them impossibilities--in itself does\r\nnot afford an adequate explanation of these peculiarities. Hence has\r\narisen what is termed the Meteoritic theory, which has been ably\r\nadvocated for many years by Sir Norman Lockyer, and with some\r\nunimportant modifications is now becoming widely accepted. Briefly, this\r\ntheory is, that the planets have been formed by the slow aggregation of\r\nsolid particles around centres of greatest condensation; but as many of\r\nmy readers may be altogether unacquainted with it, I will here give a\r\nvery clear statement of what it is, from Professor J.W. Gregory's\r\npresidential address to the Geological Section of the British\r\nAssociation of the present year. He began by saying that these modern\r\nviews were of far more practical use to men of science than that of\r\nLaplace, and that they give us a history of the world consistent with\r\nthe actual records of geology. He then continues:\r\n\r\n\"According to Sir Norman Lockyer's Meteoritic Hypothesis, nebulae,\r\ncomets, and many so-called stars consist of swarms of meteorites which,\r\nthough normally cold and dark, are heated by repeated collisions, and so\r\nbecome luminous. They may even be volatilised into glowing meteoric\r\nvapour; but in time this heat is dissipated, and the force of gravity\r\ncondenses a meteoritic swarm into a single globe. 'Some of the swarms\r\nare,' says Lockyer, 'truly members of the solar system,' and some of\r\nthese travel round the sun in nearly circular orbits, like planets. They\r\nmay be regarded as infinitesimal planets, and so Chamberlain calls them\r\n'planetismals.'\r\n\r\n\"The planetismal theory is a development of the meteoritic theory, and\r\npresents it in an especially attractive guise. It regards meteorites as\r\nvery sparsely distributed through space, and gravity as powerless to\r\ncollect them into dense groups. So it assigns the parentage of the solar\r\nsystem to a spiral nebula composed of planetismals, and the planets as\r\nformed from knots in the nebula, where many planetismals had been\r\nconcentrated near the intersections of their orbits. These groups of\r\nmeteorites, already as dense as a swarm of bees, were then packed closer\r\nby the influence of gravity, and the contracting mass was heated by the\r\npressure, even above the normal melting-point of the material, which was\r\nkept rigid by the weight of the overlying layers.\"\r\n\r\nNow, adopting this theory as the last word of science upon the subject\r\nof the origin of planets, we see that it affords immense scope for\r\ndiversity in results depending on the total _amount_ of matter available\r\nwithin the range of attraction of an incipient planetary mass, and the\r\n_rates_ at which this matter becomes available. By a special combination\r\nof these two quantities (which have almost certainly been different for\r\neach planet) I think we may be able to throw some light upon the\r\nstructure and physical features of Mars.\r\n\r\n_The Probable Mode of Origin of Mars._\r\n\r\nThis planet, lying between two of much greater mass, has evidently had\r\nless material from which to be formed by aggregation; and if we\r\nassume--as in the absence of evidence to the contrary we have a right to\r\ndo--that its beginnings were not much later (or earlier) than those of\r\nthe earth, then its smaller size shows that it has in all probability\r\naggregated very much more slowly. But the internal heat acquired by a\r\nplanet while forming in this manner will depend upon the rate at which\r\nit aggregates and the velocity with which the planetismals' fall into\r\nit, and this velocity will increase with its mass and consequent force\r\nof gravity. In the early stages of a planet's growth it will probably\r\nremain cold, the small amount of heat produced by each impact being lost\r\nby radiation before the next one occurs; and with a small and slowly\r\naggregating planet this condition will prevail till it approaches its\r\nfull size. Then only will its gravitative force be sufficient to cause\r\nincoming matter to fall upon it with so powerful an impact as to produce\r\nintense heat. Further, the compressive force of a small planet will be a\r\nless effective heat-producing agency than in the case of a larger one.\r\n\r\nThe earth we know has acquired a large amount of internal heat, probably\r\nsufficient to liquefy its whole interior; but Mars has only one-ninth\r\npart the mass of the earth, and it is quite possible, and even probable,\r\nthat its comparatively small attractive force would never have liquefied\r\nor even permanently heated the more central portions of its mass. This\r\nbeing admitted, I suggest the following course of events as quite\r\npossible, and not even improbable, in the case of this planet. During\r\nthe whole of its early growth, and till it acquired nearly its present\r\ndiameter, its rate of aggregation was so slow that the planetismals\r\nfalling upon it, though they might have been heated and even partially\r\nliquefied by the impact, were never in such quantity as to produce any\r\nconsiderable heating effect on the whole mass, and each local rise of\r\ntemperature was soon lost by radiation. The planet thus grew as a solid\r\nand cold mass, compacted together by the impact of the incoming matter\r\nas well as by its slowly increasing gravitative force. But when it had\r\nattained to within perhaps 100, perhaps 50 miles, or less, of its\r\npresent diameter, a great change occurred in the opportunity for further\r\ngrowth. Some large and dense swarm of meteorites, perhaps containing a\r\nnumber of bodies of the size of the asteroids, came within the range of\r\nthe sun's attraction and were drawn by it into an orbit which crossed\r\nthat of Mars at such a small angle that the planet was able at each\r\nrevolution to capture a considerable number of them. The result might\r\nthen be that, as in the case of the earth, the continuous inpour of the\r\nfresh matter first heated, and later on liquefied the greater part of it\r\nas well perhaps as a thin layer of the planet's original surface; so\r\nthat when in due course the whole of the meteor-swarm had been captured,\r\nMars had acquired its present mass, but would consist of an intensely\r\nheated, and either liquid or plastic thin outer shell resting upon a\r\ncold and solid interior.\r\n\r\nThe size and position of the two recently discovered satellites of Mars,\r\nwhich are believed to be not more than ten miles in diameter, the more\r\nremote revolving around its primary very little slower than the planet\r\nrotates, while the nearer one, which is considerably less distant from\r\nthe planet's surface than its own antipodes and revolves around it more\r\nthan three times during the Martian day, may perhaps be looked upon as\r\nthe remnants of the great meteor-swarm which completed the Martian\r\ndevelopment, and which are perhaps themselves destined at some distant\r\nperiod to fall into the planet. Should future astronomers witness the\r\nphenomenon the effect produced upon its surface would be full of\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nAs the result of such an origin as that suggested, Mars would possess a\r\nstructure which, in the essential feature of heat-distribution, would be\r\nthe very opposite of that which is believed to characterise the earth,\r\nyet it might have been produced by a very slight modification of the\r\nsame process. This peculiar heat-distribution, together with a much\r\nsmaller mass and gravitative force, would lead to a very different\r\ndevelopment of the surface and an altogether diverse geological history\r\nfrom ours, which has throughout been profoundly influenced by its heated\r\ninterior, its vast supply of water, and the continuous physical and\r\nchemical reactions between the interior and the crust.\r\n\r\nThese reactions have, in our case, been of substantially the same\r\nnature, and very nearly of the same degree of intensity throughout the\r\nwhole vast eons of geological time, and they have resulted in a\r\nwonderfully complex succession of rock-formations--volcanic, plutonic,\r\nand sedimentary--more or less intermingled throughout the whole series,\r\nhere remaining horizontal as when first deposited, there upheaved or\r\ndepressed, fractured or crushed, inclined or contorted; denuded by rain\r\nand rivers with the assistance of heat and cold, of frost and ice, in an\r\nunceasing series of changes, so that however varied the surface may be,\r\nwith hill and dale, plains and uplands, mountain ranges and deep\r\nintervening valleys, these are as nothing to the diversities of interior\r\nstructure, as exhibited in the sides of every alpine valley or\r\nprecipitous escarpment, and made known to us by the work of the miner\r\nand the well-borer in every part of the world.\r\n\r\n_Structural Straight Lines on the Earth._\r\n\r\nThe great characteristic of the earth, both on its surface and in its\r\ninterior, is thus seen to be extreme diversity both of form and\r\nstructure, and this is further intensified by the varied texture,\r\nconstitution, hardness, and density of the various rocks and debris of\r\nwhich it is composed. It is therefore not surprising that, with such a\r\ncomplex outer crust, we should nowhere find examples of those\r\ngeometrical forms and almost world-wide straight lines that give such a\r\nremarkable, and as Mr. Lowell maintains, 'non-natural' character to the\r\nsurface of Mars, but which, as it seems to me, of themselves afford\r\n_prima facie_ evidence of a corresponding simplicity and uniformity in\r\nits internal structure.\r\n\r\nYet we are not ourselves by any means devoid of 'straight lines'\r\nstructurally produced, in spite of every obstacle of diversity of form\r\nand texture, of softness and hardness, of lamination or crystallisation,\r\nwhich are adverse to such developments. Examples of these are the\r\nnumerous 'faults' which occur in the harder rocks, and which often\r\nextend for great distances in almost perfect straight lines. In our own\r\ncountry we have the Tyneside and Craven faults in the North of England,\r\nwhich are 30 miles long and often 20 yards wide; but even more striking\r\nis the great Cleveland Dyke--a wall of volcanic rock dipping slightly\r\ntowards the south, but sometimes being almost vertical, and stretching\r\nacross the country, over hill and dale, in an almost perfect straight\r\nline from a point on the coast ten miles north of Scarborough, in a\r\nwest-by-north direction, passing about two miles south of Stockton and\r\nterminating about six miles north-by-east of Barnard Castle, a distance\r\nof very nearly 60 miles. The great fault between the Highlands and\r\nLowlands of Scotland extends across the country from Stonehaven to near\r\nHelensburgh, a distance of 120 miles; and there are very many more of\r\nless importance.\r\n\r\nMuch more extensive are some of the great continental dislocations,\r\noften forming valleys of considerable width and length. The Upper Rhine\r\nflows in one of these great valleys of subsidence for about 180 miles,\r\nfrom Mulhausen to Frankfort, in a generally straight line, though\r\nmodified by denudation. Vaster still is the valley of the Jordan through\r\nthe Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea, continued by the Wady Arabah to the\r\nGulf of Akaba, believed to form one vast geological depression or\r\nfracture extending in a straight line for 400 miles.\r\n\r\nThousands of such faults, dykes, or depressions exist in every part of\r\nthe world, all believed to be due to the gradual shrinking of the heated\r\ninterior to which the solid crust has to accommodate itself, and they\r\nare especially interesting and instructive for our present purpose as\r\nshowing the tendency of such fractures of solid rock-material to extend\r\nto great lengths in straight lines, notwithstanding the extreme\r\nirregularity both in the surface contour as well as in the internal\r\nstructures of the varied deposits and formations through which they\r\npass.\r\n\r\n_Probable Origin of the Surface-features of Mars._\r\n\r\nReturning now to Mars, let us consider the probable course of events\r\nfrom the point at which we left it. The heat produced by impact and\r\ncondensation would be likely to release gases which had been in\r\ncombination with some of the solid matter, or perhaps been itself in a\r\nsolid state due to intense cold, and these, escaping outwards to the\r\nsurface, would produce on a small scale a certain amount of upheaval and\r\nvolcanic disturbance; and as an outer crust rapidly formed, a number of\r\nvents might remain as craters or craterlets in a moderate state of\r\nactivity. Owing to the comparatively small force of gravity, the outer\r\ncrust would become scoriaceous and more or less permeated by the gases,\r\nwhich would continue to escape through it, and this would facilitate the\r\ncooling of the whole of the heated outer crust, and allow it to become\r\nrather densely compacted. When the greater portion of the gases had thus\r\nescaped to the outer surface and assisted to form a scanty atmosphere,\r\nsuch as now exists, there would be no more internal disturbance and the\r\ncooling of the heated outer coating would steadily progress, resulting\r\nat last in a slightly heated, and later in a cold layer of moderate\r\nthickness and great general uniformity. Owing to the absence of rain and\r\nrivers, denudation such as we experience would be unknown, though the\r\nsuperficial scoriaceous crust might be partially broken up by expansion\r\nand contraction, and suffer a certain amount of atmospheric erosion.\r\n\r\nThe final result of this mode of aggregation would be, that the planet\r\nwould consist of an outer layer of moderate thickness as compared with\r\nthe central mass, which outer layer would have cooled from a highly\r\nheated state to a temperature considerably below the freezing-point, and\r\nthis would have been all the time _contracting upon a previously cold,\r\nand therefore non-contracting nucleus._ The result would be that very\r\nearly in the process great superficial tensions would be produced, which\r\ncould only be relieved by cracks or fissures, which would initiate at\r\npoints of weakness--probably at the craterlets already referred to--from\r\nwhich they would radiate in several directions. Each crack thus formed\r\nnear the surface would, as cooling progressed, develop in length and\r\ndepth; and owing to the general uniformity of the material, and possibly\r\nsome amount of crystalline structure due to slow and continuous cooling\r\ndown to a very low temperature, the cracks would tend to run on in\r\nstraight lines and to extend vertically downwards, which two\r\ncircumstances would necessarily result in their forming portions of\r\n'great circles' on the planet's surface--the two great facts which Mr.\r\nLowell appeals to as being especially 'non-natural.'\r\n\r\n_Symmetry of Basaltic Columns._\r\n\r\nWe have however one quite natural fact on our earth which serves to\r\nillustrate one of these two features, the direction of the downward\r\nfissure. This is, the comparatively common phenomenon of basaltic\r\ncolumns and 'Giant's Causeways.' The wonderful regularity of these, and\r\nespecially the not unfrequent upright pillars in serried ranks, as in\r\nthe palisades of the Hudson river, must have always impressed observers\r\nwith their appearance of artificiality. Yet they are undoubtedly the\r\nresult of the very slow cooling and contraction of melted rocks under\r\ncompression by strata _below and above them_, so that, when once\r\nsolidified, the mass was held in position and the tension produced by\r\ncontraction could only be relieved by numerous very small cracks at\r\nshort distances from each other in every direction, resulting in five,\r\nsix, or seven-sided polygons, with sides only a few inches long. This\r\ncontraction began of course at the coolest surface, generally the upper\r\none; and observation of these columns in various positions has\r\nestablished the rule that their direction lengthways _is always at right\r\nangles to the cooling surface_, and thus, whenever this surface was\r\nhorizontal, the columns became almost exactly vertical.\r\n\r\n_How this applies to Mars._\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the surface of Mars that Mr. Lowell describes\r\nwith much confidence is, that it is wonderfully uniform and level, which\r\nof course it would be if it had once been in a liquid or plastic state,\r\nand not much disturbed since by volcanic or other internal movements.\r\nThe result would be that cracks formed by contraction of the hardened\r\nouter crust would be vertical; and, in a generally uniform material at a\r\nvery uniform temperature, these cracks would continue almost\r\nindefinitely in straight lines. The hardened and contracting surface\r\nbeing free to move laterally on account of there being a more heated and\r\nplastic layer below it, the cracks once initiated above would\r\ncontinually widen at the surface as they penetrated deeper and deeper\r\ninto the slightly heated substratum. Now, as basalt begins to soften at\r\nabout 1400° F. and the surface of Mars has cooled to at least the\r\nfreezing-point--perhaps very much below it--the contraction would be so\r\ngreat that if the fissures produced were 500 miles apart they might be\r\nthree miles wide at the surface, and, if only 100 miles apart, then\r\nabout two-thirds of a mile wide.[15] But as the production of the\r\nfissures might have occupied perhaps millions of years, a considerable\r\namount of atmospheric denudation would result, however slowly it acted.\r\nExpansion and contraction would wear away the edges and sides of the\r\nfissures, fill up many of them with the debris, and widen them at the\r\nsurfaces to perhaps double their original size.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The coefficient of contraction of basalt is 0.000006 for\r\n1° F., which would lead to the results given here.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Mr. W.H. Pickering observed clouds on Mars 15 miles high;\r\nthese are the 'projections' seen on the terminator when the planet is\r\npartially illuminated. They were at first thought to be mountains; but\r\nduring the opposition of 1894, more than 400 of them were seen at\r\nFlagstaff during nine months' observation. Usually they are of rare\r\noccurrence. They are seen to change in form and position from day to\r\nday, and Mr. Lowell is strongly of opinion that they are dust-storms,\r\nnot what we term clouds. They were mostly about 13 miles high,\r\nindicating considerable aerial disturbance on the planet, and therefore\r\ncapable of producing proportional surface denudation.]\r\n\r\n_Suggested Explanation of the 'Oases.'_\r\n\r\nThe numerous round dots seen upon the 'canals,' and especially at points\r\nfrom which several canals radiate and where they intersect--termed\r\n'oases' by Mr. Lowell and 'craterlets' by Mr. Pickering may be explained\r\nin two ways. Those from which several canals radiate may be true craters\r\nfrom which the gases imprisoned in the heated surface layers have\r\ngradually escaped. They would be situated at points of weakness in the\r\ncrust, and become centres from which cracks would start during\r\ncontraction. Those dots which occur at the crossing of two straight\r\ncanals or cracks may have originated from the fact that at such\r\nintersections there would be four sharply-projecting angles, which,\r\nbeing exposed to the influence of alternate heat and cold (during day\r\nand night) on the two opposite surfaces, would inevitably in time become\r\nfractured and crumbled away, resulting in the formation of a roughly\r\ncircular chasm which would become partly filled up by the debris. Those\r\nformed by cracks radiating from craterlets would also be subject to the\r\nsame process of rounding off to an even greater extent; and thus would\r\nbe produced the 'oases' of various sizes up to 50 miles or more in\r\ndiameter recorded by Mr. Lowell and other observers.\r\n\r\n_Probable Function of the Great Fissures._\r\n\r\nMr. Pickering, as we have seen, supposes that these fissures give out\r\nthe gases which, overflowing on each side, favour the growth of the\r\nsupposed vegetation which renders the course of the canals visible, and\r\nthis no doubt may have been the case during the remote periods when\r\nthese cracks gave access to the heated portions of the surface layer.\r\nBut it seems more probable that Mars has now cooled down to the almost\r\nuniform mean temperature it derives from solar heat, and that the\r\nfissures--now for the most part broad shallow valleys--serve merely as\r\nchannels along which the liquids and heavy gases derived from the\r\nmelting of the polar snows naturally flow, and, owing to their nearly\r\nlevel surfaces, overflow to a certain distance on each side of them.\r\n\r\n_Suggested Origin of the Blue Patches._\r\n\r\nThese heavy gases, mainly perhaps, as has been often suggested,\r\ncarbon-dioxide, would, when in large quantity and of considerable depth,\r\nreflect a good deal of light, and, being almost inevitably dust-laden,\r\nmight produce that blue tinge adjacent to the melting snow-caps which\r\nMr. Lowell has erroneously assumed to be itself a proof of the presence\r\nof liquid water. Just as the blue of our sky is undoubtedly due to\r\nreflection from the ultra-minute dust particles in our higher\r\natmosphere, similar particles brought down by the 'snow' from the higher\r\nMartian atmosphere might produce the blue tinge in the great volumes of\r\nheavy gas produced by its evaporation or liquefaction.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that Mr. Lowell objects to the carbon-dioxide theory of\r\nthe formation of the snow-caps, that this gas at low pressures does not\r\nliquefy, but passes at once from the solid to the gaseous state, and\r\nthat only water remains liquid sufficiently long to produce the blue\r\ncolour' which plays so large a part in his argument for the mild climate\r\nessential for an inhabited planet. But this argument, as I have already\r\nshown, is valueless. For only very deep water can possibly show a blue\r\ncolour by reflected light, while a dust-laden atmosphere--especially\r\nwith a layer of very dense gas at the bottom of it, as would be the case\r\nwith the newly evaporated carbon-dioxide from the diminishing snow-cap\r\n--would provide the very conditions likely to produce this blue tinge of\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nIt may be considered a support to this view that carbonic-acid gas\r\nbecomes liquid at--140° F. and solid at--162° F., temperatures far\r\nhigher than we should expect to prevail in the polar and north temperate\r\nregions of Mars during a considerable part of the year, but such as\r\nmight be reached there during the summer solstice when the `snows' so\r\nrapidly disappear, to be re-formed a few months later.\r\n\r\n_The Double Canals._\r\n\r\nThe curious phenomena of the 'double canals' are undoubtedly the most\r\ndifficult to explain satisfactorily on any theory that has yet been\r\nsuggested. They vary in distance apart from about 100 to 400 miles. In\r\nmany cases they appear perfectly parallel, and Mr. Lowell gives us the\r\nimpression that they are almost always so. But his maps show, in some\r\ncases, decided differences of width at the two extremities, indicating\r\nconsiderable want of parallelism. A few of the curved canals are also\r\ndouble.\r\n\r\nThere is one drawing in Mr. Lowell's book (p. 219) of the mouths, or\r\nstarting points, of the Euphrates and Phison, two widely separated\r\ndouble canals diverging at an angle of about 40° from the same two\r\noases, so that the two inner canals cross each other. Now this suggests\r\ntwo wide bands of weakness in the planet's crust radiating probably from\r\nwithin the dark tract called the 'Mare Icarium,' and that some\r\nwidespread volcanic outburst initiated diverging cracks on either side\r\nof these bands. Something of this kind may have been the cause of most\r\nof the double canals, or they may have been started from two or more\r\ncraterlets not far apart, the direction being at first decided by some\r\nlocal peculiarity of structure; and where begun continuing in straight\r\nlines owing to homogeneity or uniform density of material. This is very\r\nvague, but the phenomena are so remarkable, and so very imperfectly\r\nknown at present, that nothing but suggestion can be attempted.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on the 'Canals.'_\r\n\r\nIn this somewhat detailed exposition of a possible, and, I hope, a\r\nprobable explanation of the surface-features of Mars, I have\r\nendeavoured to be guided by known facts or accepted theories both\r\nastronomical and geological. I think I may claim to have shown that\r\nthere are some analogous features of terrestrial rock-structure to\r\nserve as guides towards a natural and intelligible explanation of the\r\nstrange geometric markings discovered during the last thirty years, and\r\nwhich have raised this planet from comparative obscurity into a position\r\nof the very first rank both in astronomical and popular interest.\r\n\r\nThis wide-spread interest is very largely due to Mr. Lowell's devotion\r\nto its study, both in seeking out so admirable a position as regards\r\naltitude and climate, and in establishing there a first-class\r\nobservatory; and also in bringing his discoveries before the public in\r\nconnection with a theory so startling as to compel attention. I venture\r\nto think that his merit as one of our first astronomical observers will\r\nin no way be diminished by the rejection of his theory, and the\r\nsubstitution of one more in accordance with the actually observed facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n_A Suggested Experiment to Illustrate the 'Canals' of Mars._\r\n\r\nIf my explanation of the 'canals' should be substantially correct--that\r\nis, if they were produced by the contraction of a heated outward crust\r\nupon a cold, and therefore non-contracting interior, the result of such\r\na condition might be shown experimentally.\r\n\r\nSeveral baked clay balls might be formed to serve as cores, say of 8 to\r\n10 inches in diameter. These being fixed within moulds of say half an\r\ninch to an inch greater diameter, the outer layer would be formed by\r\npouring in some suitable heated liquid material, and releasing it from\r\nthe mould as soon as consolidation occurs, so that it may cool rapidly\r\nfrom the _outside._ Some kinds of impure glass, or the brittle metals\r\nbismuth or antimony or alloys of these might be used, in order to see\r\nwhat form the resulting fractures would take. It would be well to have\r\nseveral duplicates of each ball, and, as soon as tension through\r\ncontraction manifests itself, to try the effect of firing very small\r\ncharges of small shot to ascertain whether such impacts would start\r\nradiating fractures. When taken from the moulds, the balls should be\r\nsuspended in a slight current of air, and kept rotating, to reproduce\r\nthe planetary condition as nearly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe exact size and material of the cores, the thickness of the heated\r\nouter crust, the material best suited to show fracture by contraction,\r\nand the details of their treatment, might be modified in various ways as\r\nsuggested by the results first obtained. Such a series of experiments\r\nwould probably throw further light on the physical conditions which have\r\nproduced the gigantic system of fissures or channels we see upon the\r\nsurface of Mars, though it would not, of course, prove that such\r\nconditions actually existed there. In such a speculative matter we can\r\nonly be guided by probabilities, based upon whatever evidence is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThis little volume has necessarily touched upon a great variety of\r\nsubjects, in order to deal in a tolerably complete manner with the very\r\nextraordinary theories by which Mr. Lowell attempts to explain the\r\nunique features of the surface of the planet, which, by long-continued\r\nstudy, he has almost made his own. It may therefore be well to sum up\r\nthe main points of the arguments against his view, introducing a few\r\nother facts and considerations which greatly strengthen my argument.\r\n\r\nThe one great feature of Mars which led Mr. Lowell to adopt the view of\r\nits being inhabited by a race of highly intelligent beings, and, with\r\never-increasing discovery to uphold this theory to the present time, is\r\nundoubtedly that of the so-called 'canals'--their straightness, their\r\nenormous length, their great abundance, and their extension over the\r\nplanet's whole surface from one polar snow-cap to the other. The very\r\nimmensity of this system, and its constant growth and extension during\r\nfifteen years of persistent observation, have so completely taken\r\npossession of his mind, that, after a very hasty glance at analogous\r\nfacts and possibilities, he has declared them to be 'non-natural'--\r\ntherefore to be works of art--therefore to necessitate the\r\npresence of highly intelligent beings who have designed and constructed\r\nthem. This idea has coloured or governed all his writings on the\r\nsubject. The innumerable difficulties which it raises have been either\r\nignored, or brushed aside on the flimsiest evidence. As examples, he\r\nnever even discusses the totally inadequate water-supply for such\r\nworldwide irrigation, or the extreme irrationality of constructing so\r\nvast a canal-system the waste from which, by evaporation, when exposed\r\nto such desert conditions as he himself describes, would use up ten\r\ntimes the probable supply.\r\n\r\nAgain, he urges the 'purpose' displayed in these 'canals.' Their being\r\n_all_ so straight, _all_ describing great circles of the 'sphere,' all\r\nbeing so evidently arranged (as he thinks) either to carry water to some\r\n'oasis' 2000 miles away, or to reach some arid region far over the\r\nequator in the opposite hemisphere! But he never considers the\r\ndifficulties this implies. Everywhere these canals run for thousands of\r\nmiles across waterless deserts, forming a system and indicating a\r\npurpose, the wonderful perfection of which he is never tired of dwelling\r\nupon (but which I myself can nowhere perceive).\r\n\r\nYet he never even attempts to explain how the Martians could have lived\r\n_before_ this great system was planned and executed, or why they did not\r\n_first_ utilise and render fertile the belt of land adjacent to the\r\nlimits of the polar snows--why the method of irrigation did not, as with\r\nall human arts, begin gradually, at home, with terraces and channels to\r\nirrigate the land close to the source of the water. How, with such a\r\ndesert as he describes three-fourths of Mars to be, did the inhabitants\r\never get to _know_ anything of the equatorial regions and its needs, so\r\nas to start right away to supply those needs? All this, to my mind, is\r\nquite opposed to the idea of their being works of art, and altogether in\r\nfavour of their being natural features of a globe as peculiar in origin\r\nand internal structure as it is in its surface-features. The explanation\r\nI have given, though of course hypothetical, is founded on known\r\ncosmical and terrestrial facts, and is, I suggest, far more scientific\r\nas well as more satisfactory than Mr. Lowell's wholly unsupported\r\nspeculation. This view I have explained in some detail in the preceding\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell never even refers to the important question of loss by\r\nevaporation in these enormous open canals, or considers the undoubted\r\nfact that the only intelligent and practical way to convey a limited\r\nquantity of water such great distances would be by a system of\r\nwater-tight and air-tight tubes laid _under the ground._ The mere\r\nattempt to use open canals for such a purpose shows complete ignorance\r\nand stupidity in these alleged very superior beings; while it is certain\r\nthat, long before half of them were completed their failure to be of any\r\nuse would have led any rational beings to cease constructing them.\r\n\r\nHe also fails to consider the difficulty, that, if these canals are\r\nnecessary for existence in Mars, how did the inhabitants ever reach a\r\nsufficiently large population with surplus food and leisure enabling\r\nthem to rise from the low condition of savages to one of civilisation,\r\nand ultimately to scientific knowledge? Here again is a dilemma which is\r\nhard to overcome. Only a _dense_ population with _ample_ means of\r\nsubsistence could possibly have constructed such gigantic works; but,\r\ngiven these two conditions, no adequate motive existed for the\r\nconception and execution of them--even if they were likely to be of any\r\nuse, which I have shown they could not be.\r\n\r\n_Further Considerations on the Climate of Mars._\r\n\r\nRecurring now to the question of climate, which is all-important, Mr.\r\nLowell never even discusses the essential point--the temperature that\r\nmust _necessarily_ result from an atmospheric envelope one-twelfth (or\r\nat most one-seventh) the density of our own; in either case\r\ncorresponding to an altitude far greater than that of our highest\r\nmountains.[17] Surely this phenomenon, everywhere manifested on the\r\nearth even under the equator, of a regular decrease of temperature with\r\naltitude, the only cause of which is a less dense atmosphere, should\r\nhave been fairly grappled with, and some attempt made to show why it\r\nshould not apply to Mars, except the weak remark that on a level surface\r\nit will not have the same effect as on exposed mountain heights. But it\r\n_does_ have the same effect, or very nearly so, on our lofty plateaux\r\noften hundreds of miles in extent, in proportion to their altitude.\r\nQuito, at 9350 ft. above the sea, has a mean temperature of about 57°\r\nF., giving a lowering of 23° from that of Manaos at the mouth of the Rio\r\nNegro. This is about a degree for each 400 feet, while the general fall\r\nfor isolated mountains is about one degree in 340 feet according to\r\nHumboldt, who notes the above difference between the rate of cooling for\r\naltitude of the plains--or more usually sheltered valleys in which the\r\ntowns are situated--and the exposed mountain sides. It will be seen that\r\nthis lower rate would bring the temperature of Mars at the equator down\r\nto 20° F. below the freezing point of water from this cause alone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: A four inches barometer is equivalent to a height of\r\n40,000 feet above sea-level with us.]\r\n\r\nBut all enquirers have admitted, that if conditions as to atmosphere\r\nwere the same as on the earth, its greater distance from the sun would\r\nreduce the temperature to-31° F., equal to 63° below the freezing\r\npoint. It is therefore certain that the combined effect of both causes\r\nmust bring the temperature of Mars down to at least 70° or 80°below the\r\nfreezing point.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this absolute dependence of terrestrial temperatures upon\r\ndensity of the air-envelope is seldom discussed in text-books either of\r\ngeography or of physics, and there seems to be still some uncertainty\r\nabout it. Some impute it wholly to the thinner air being unable to\r\nabsorb and retain so much heat as that which is more dense; but if this\r\nwere the case the soil at great altitudes not having so much of its heat\r\ntaken up by the air should be warmer than below, since it undoubtedly\r\n_receives_ more heat owing to the greater transparency of the air above\r\nit; but it certainly does not become warmer. The more correct view seems\r\nto be that the loss of heat by radiation is increased so much through\r\nthe rarity of the air above it as to _more_ than counterbalance the\r\nincreased insolation, so that though the surface of the earth at a given\r\naltitude may receive 10 per cent. more direct sun-heat it loses by\r\ndirect radiation, combined with diminished air and cloud-radiation,\r\nperhaps 20 or 25 per cent. more, whence there is a resultant cooling\r\neffect of 10 or 15 per cent. This acts by day as well as by night, so\r\nthat the greater heat received at high altitudes does not warm the soil\r\nso much as a less amount of heat with a denser atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis effect is further intensified by the fact that a less dense cannot\r\nabsorb and transmit so much heat as a more dense atmosphere. Here then\r\nwe have an absolute law of nature to be observed operating everywhere on\r\nthe earth, and the mode of action of which is fairly well understood.\r\nThis law is, that reduced atmospheric pressure increases radiation, or\r\nloss of heat, _more rapidly_ than it increases insolation or gain of\r\nheat, so that the result is _always_ a considerable _lowering_ of\r\ntemperature. What this lowering is can be seen in the universal fact,\r\nthat even within the tropics perpetual snow covers the higher mountain\r\nsummits, while on the high plains of the Andes, at 15,000 or 16,000 feet\r\naltitude, where there is very little or no snow, travellers are often\r\nfrozen to death when delayed by storms; yet at this elevation the\r\natmosphere has much more than double the density of that of Mars!\r\n\r\nThe error in Mr. Lowell's argument is, that he claims for the scanty\r\natmosphere of Mars that it allows more sun-heat to reach the surface;\r\nbut he omits to take account of the enormously increased loss of heat by\r\ndirect radiation, as well as by the diminution of air-radiation, which\r\ntogether necessarily produce a great reduction of temperature.\r\n\r\nIt is this great principle of the prepotency of radiation over\r\nabsorption with a diminishing atmosphere that explains the excessively\r\nlow temperature of the moon's surface, a fact which also serves to\r\nindicate a very low temperature for Mars, as I have shown in Chapter VI.\r\nThese two independent arguments--from alpine temperatures and from those\r\nof the moon--support and enforce each other, and afford a conclusive\r\nproof (as against anything advanced by Mr. Lowell) that the temperature\r\nof Mars must be far too low to support animal life.\r\n\r\nA third independent argument leading to the same result is Dr. Johnstone\r\nStoney's proof that aqueous vapour cannot exist on Mars; and this fact\r\nMr. Lowell does not attempt to controvert.\r\n\r\nTo put the whole case in the fewest possible words:\r\n\r\nAll physicists are agreed that, owing to the distance of Mars from the\r\nsun, it would have a mean temperature of about-35° F. (= 456° F. abs.)\r\neven if it had an atmosphere as dense as ours.\r\n\r\n(2) But the very low temperatures on the earth under the equator, at a\r\nheight where the barometer stands at about three times as high as on\r\nMars, proves, that from scantiness of atmosphere alone Mars cannot\r\npossibly have a temperature as high as the freezing point of water; and\r\nthis proof is supported by Langley's determination of the low _maximum_\r\ntemperature of the full moon.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these two results must bring down the temperature of\r\nMars to a degree wholly incompatible with the existence of animal life.\r\n\r\n(3) The quite independent proof that water-vapour cannot exist on Mars,\r\nand that therefore, the first essential of organic life--water--is\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion from these three independent proofs, which enforce each\r\nother in the multiple ratio of their respective weights, is therefore\r\nirresistible--that animal life, especially in its higher forms, cannot\r\nexist on the planet.\r\n\r\nMars, therefore, is not only uninhabited by intelligent beings such as\r\nMr. Lowell postulates, but is absolutely UNINHABITABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Is Mars Habitable?, by Alfred Russel Wallace",
