It is hoped that readers of various ages will be entertained,\r\nwithout suspecting that they are being taught.\r\n\r\nSeveral things led the author to believe that such a book might be\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The circumstances under which it was written.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The fact that there seemed to be an opportunity for improvement\r\nnot only in the popular presentation of scientific topics but in the\r\ncharacter and method of review questions and suggestions following such\r\ntopics in school texts.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Experience has shown that pictures may be made to perform a much\r\nmore vital function in teaching than is usually assigned to them in the\r\ntext-books.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On this subject I cannot do better, perhaps, than quote\r\nfrom an article on \"The Picture Book in Education,\" contributed to the\r\nNew York _Evening Post_:\r\n\r\n\"We learn more easily by looking at things than by memorizing words\r\nabout them. The principle, of course, holds whether the image which the\r\neye receives comes from the object itself or only from the picture of\r\nthe object. Therefore we should learn to read pictures as well as books.\r\n\r\n\"New York has long recognized the added efficiency in the teaching\r\nprocess to be obtained from the use of pictures. The Division of\r\nVisual Instruction, established thirty years ago, has an international\r\nreputation for the extent of its equipment, the simplicity of its\r\nmethods, and the excellence of its results.\"]\r\n\r\n(_d_) In the particular field to which this story relates comparatively\r\nlittle has been written either for reading in the family circle or for\r\nuse in the school; although the relation of physiography, not only to\r\nhuman history and political and commercial geography but to the whole\r\nimmense realm of natural science, is so basic and its great principles\r\nand processes so striking in their appeal to curiosity and our sense of\r\nthe grand and the dramatic.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Commenting on the need of popular literature dealing with\r\nearth science, Doctor Shaler says:\r\n\r\n\"In no other fields are large and important truths so distinctly\r\nrelated to human interests so readily traced; yet the treatises dealing\r\nwith these truths are few in number and generally recondite.\"]\r\n\r\nWhat here appear as chapters were originally little talks for the\r\nevening entertainment of the juvenile members of a certain family and\r\nthe neighboring children, who were attracted by what came to be known\r\nas the \"pebble parties,\" during the season at Mount Desert Island. They\r\nare here given in substantially the form in which they first saw the\r\nlight. While they proved entirely intelligible to boys and girls of\r\neight and ten they seemed equally interesting to the older members of\r\nthe audience, including a youth of eighteen in his last year of high\r\nschool, whose comments, in the language of his caste, deserve to share\r\nthe credit for whatever of whimsical humor and colloquial style the\r\nauthor may have succeeded in incorporating into the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe familiar tone, the number and variety of the chapters, the\r\nsub-heads and marginal captions and the character and treatment of\r\nthe illustrations have a similar origin. They represent the variety\r\nof aspects under which it was found necessary to present the facts in\r\norder to hold a capricious audience whose attendance and attention\r\nwere wholly voluntary.\r\n\r\nThe use of unfamiliar words and scientific terms has been avoided as\r\nmuch as possible, consistent with the educational purpose of the book.\r\nIt is to be remembered that educators do not consider it good practice\r\nto omit all words which children cannot understand at sight; the theory\r\nbeing that it is by the judicious introduction of words not current\r\non the playground that the intellectual interests and capacities of\r\nchildren are enlarged. With regard to scientific topics (it is further\r\nargued) a large proportion of the classics of science written for the\r\ngeneral reader and which boys and girls of fourteen and upward should\r\nbe able to read easily and with pleasure--Shaler, Darwin, and Wallace,\r\nfor example--contain quite a few scientific terms; and these it would\r\nbe well that young people learn from context or definition in their\r\nprevious reading in works of a more elementary nature.\r\n\r\nMoreover, while younger children will read a book the general character\r\nof which interests them, even though they do not understand every word\r\nor get all the thoughts in it, sophisticated youths of the high-school\r\nage will have none of it, if they suspect that they are being talked\r\ndown to. In the story of the pebble the aim, accordingly, has been not\r\nonly to make a book that young people will not outgrow but one that\r\nwill be of some interest to adults, particularly to travellers.\r\n\r\nNot only in the text is special emphasis laid on the interpretation\r\nof landscape, but the character, treatment, and arrangement of the\r\nillustrations is intended to train the eye to read the story of the\r\nearth drama as recorded in the forms of valley, mountain, field,\r\nand shore. And--since the earth is not, after all, a mere geological\r\nspecimen--these illustrations include reproductions of paintings,\r\nscenery as interpreted by the poet and the artist.\r\n\r\nTo create an appropriate atmosphere and so add to the vividness of\r\nconception, the twelve chapters each deal with a seasonable subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelation to the Text-Book\r\n\r\nThe relation of this book to the formal study of physiography or\r\ngeology in the schools will be apparent. The classified and exhaustive\r\ntreatment of the text-book, while so admirably adapted to organize\r\nknowledge already acquired, or reward an appetite already aroused, is\r\nnot at all adapted for creating this appetite in the first place; a\r\nthing so essential to true progress in education. For example, in a\r\ntext-book, the many aspects of glaciers and their work, which are here\r\ndistributed in a number of sections (as the discovery of these aspects\r\nwas distributed in time), are usually dealt with in a single chapter or\r\nseries of chapters, whose nature the reader at once gathers from the\r\ntitle, \"The Work of the Glaciers.\"\r\n\r\nThe young reader or school pupil is thus deprived of the element of\r\nsurprise, of the pleasure of following an unfolding mystery, which was\r\nat once the inspiration and reward of men of science to whom we owe\r\nthese discoveries.\r\n\r\nIf left to the text-book alone, the student acquires his facts too\r\nrapidly and too easily. The result is a loss of both pleasure and\r\nprofit. The movements of the glaciers and the nature of the movement,\r\nwhich gave Agassiz seven years of keen delight to ascertain, the pupil\r\nacquires through his text-book in something like seven minutes, and\r\nwithout either the pleasure or the profit of Agassiz' gradual and\r\ninductive acquirement of this knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn other words, to begin the study of a given science by means of a\r\ntext-book, without previously arousing interest in the subject, is to\r\nassume a greater zeal on the part of school pupils and college students\r\nthan, it is reasonable to assume, was possessed by the scientists\r\nthemselves. It was the attraction of the unknown rather than the rapid\r\nacquirement of the known that drew them on to their grand discoveries,\r\ntheir illuminating generalizations.\r\n\r\nIn recording the pebble's story the endeavor has been to cause the\r\nreader to come upon the data on which these generalizations were based,\r\npiece by piece, here a little and there a little--as did the scientists\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nInteresting as the mere facts of physiographic science finally become\r\nto the trained scientist they make little appeal either to the average\r\nboy or the average adult, if he must first come in contact with them as\r\nthey are presented in the text-book; classified, catalogued, labelled\r\nin scientific terms and laid away (as it seems to him) in chapter,\r\nsection, and paragraph, like specimens in a museum.\r\n\r\nSince this book is concerned mainly with landscapes and the story of\r\nthe forces that helped to shape them it does not undertake to deal\r\nwith mineralogy. Within the fields thus defined it is believed that\r\nthe larger facts, the great moving causes of things, have been covered\r\nas thoroughly as they are in the average elementary text-book. In\r\naddition, subjects in great variety are touched upon which do not come\r\nwithin the province of the text-book, but are such as naturally suggest\r\nthemselves in the broader and richer discussion of such topics in the\r\nconversation of cultivated people.\r\n\r\n\r\nHide and Seek in the Library\r\n\r\nSince the whole purpose of the school is to prepare for the larger\r\nworld of life and books outside the school, special attention is\r\ninvited to the department of questions and suggestions following each\r\nchapter. As indicated in the introduction to the first of the series,\r\nan effort has been made to capitalize the fact that young people enjoy\r\nconundrums and curious quests in the field of books quite as well as\r\nmere passive reading.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is somewhat discursive, and in this and other respects\r\nis intended to be more like the conversation of cultivated parents\r\nwith their children than like the review questions of a text-book; the\r\nreview element being incidental, in recalling the topics out of which\r\nthese questions and suggestions grow. The correlations in the most\r\nmodern texts lead into equally wide and varied fields.\r\n\r\nIf he has succeeded in the aim thus indicated, the author believes this\r\ndepartment may easily prove one of the most interesting as well as\r\neducatively useful features of the work.\r\n\r\n                                                                  H.

How the Worlds and Myself Were Born\r\n\r\nI've been through fire and water, _I_ tell you! From my earliest\r\npebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to\r\nthis world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MR. APOLLO TURNED ON THE LIGHT\r\n\r\nThe first scenes of all in my strange, eventful history remind me of\r\nthe old Greek story about Apollo and that boy of his--Phaeton. Apollo's\r\nbusiness, you remember, was to take the sun through the skies every day\r\nin his golden chariot, so that people could see to get about. It was a\r\nticklish job, as the horses were fiery. As a rule, however, things went\r\nfairly well. To be sure, there were overdone days occasionally, just\r\nas there are now. Then the crops would wither and the birds and brooks\r\nstop singing. This, as the little Greek boys and girls believed, was\r\nbecause Apollo's horses ran too near the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW MR. APOLLO TURNED ON THE LIGHT\r\n\r\n  Behold the sun-god starting on his daily round! Aurora, Goddess of\r\n  the Dawn, precedes him scattering flowers, the lovely colors of the\r\n  morning sky. The other figures are the early hours.\r\n\r\n  The Greek poets used to play with these myth stories a good deal,\r\n  changing them to suit their poetic fancy. Theocritus, for example,\r\n  in a beautiful fragment that has come down to us, paints this\r\n  picture of the breaking day:\r\n\r\n    \"Dawn, up from the sea to the sky,\r\n     By her fleet-footed steeds was drawn.\"\r\n\r\n  You see, according to this poet's conception, Miss Dawn had a\r\n  chariot of her own.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut nothing serious happened until one time Phaeton persuaded father to\r\nlet him drive the sun chariot for a day. The horses, feeling at once a\r\nnew and weak hand on the reins, tore out of the regular road and went\r\ndashing right and left. They even got so near the North Pole that the\r\nice began to melt. They fairly flew down toward the earth, set the\r\nmountains smoking, and dried up all the springs and most of the rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEN THINGS BEGAN TO HAPPEN\r\n\r\nThey dried up a certain great lake, so that there is to this day the\r\nLibyan Desert in Africa, where this lake used to be. They made the very\r\nsea shrink so that there were \"wide naked plains where once its billows\r\nrose.\"\r\n\r\nFinally Mother Earth called on Jupiter Pluvius, as god of thunder,\r\nrain, and storms, to stop Phaeton and the runaways and put out the fire.\r\n\r\nStruck by a bolt of lightning poor Phaeton fell headlong from the\r\nskies, and a world-wide rain put out the world-wide fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a cameo by Da Vinci_\r\n\r\n                          THE FALL OF PHAETON\r\n\r\n                          (Museum, Florence)\r\n]\r\n\r\nNow, would you believe it, this queer old Old World story may really be\r\ntrue in its way. Of course there never was a sun god and no spoiled boy\r\nwho did just that thing; although many spoiled boys have _tried_ to set\r\nthe world on fire and failed because they thought it would be so easy.\r\n\r\nBut the earth really has been on fire in a sense; that is, has melted\r\nfrom the heat. And in parts where you would least suspect--the rocks.\r\nThere's where I got into it. And some of these rocks, not more than\r\nten miles[3] from where you live, are either still molten, or continue\r\nto melt from time to time; as you can see when lava comes pouring from\r\nvolcanoes, such as those of Hawaii.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Straight down, of course.]\r\n\r\nIn the days of the Apollo story most men still thought the earth was\r\nthe centre of the universe; that the sun, moon, and stars moved around\r\nit. But Pythagoras, one of the Greek philosophers, had formed a general\r\nnotion of the truth that the earth is only one planet in a great\r\nsystem. Then, along in the Sixteenth Century, came Copernicus, and by\r\nmathematical calculation--he was a fine hand at figures--began to find\r\nout things that showed the wise old Greek had made a happy guess. Then\r\nGalileo, Kepler, Newton, and others, each working on different parts of\r\nthe problem, finally settled the question. They found that there are\r\njust worlds of worlds, and that ours is only one of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the American Revolution a great French mathematician,\r\nLaplace, worked out a story of the origin of the earth which is,\r\nbriefly, this:\r\n\r\nWhat we know now as the solar system--the sun with its attendant\r\nworlds--was once a single big ball of fiery gas, a nebula. As this\r\nnebula cooled it shrank, and as it shrank it whirled faster because\r\nit had a smaller track in which to turn, and with an equal amount of\r\nforce would, of course, get around oftener. The faster it whirled\r\nthe more the outside of it tended to fly off, as water flies off a\r\nwhirling grindstone or as a stone flies from a sling. This centrifugal\r\nor \"fly-away\" force was greatest at the sun's equator, and it threw\r\noff big rings. Afterward, around some centre of greater density in\r\nthese rings, the gaseous particles in the rest of the ring gathered, so\r\nforming spheres. Then some of the spheres themselves threw off rings in\r\nthe same way which became what are called satellites. The moon, which\r\nis our satellite, Laplace supposed to have originated in this way.\r\nThe ring which Saturn still wears he thought would some day become a\r\nsatellite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _By permission of the Mount Wilson Observatory_\r\n\r\n                     WATCHING THE MAKING OF WORLDS\r\n\r\n  At first you won't see anything very striking about this picture,\r\n  perhaps; but doesn't it give you something of a thrill to be told\r\n  that you are here looking not only at the making of a _world_,\r\n  but of worlds of worlds? A whole solar system! In the course of\r\n  unthinkable time that big, round ball in the center will be the\r\n  sun, and what appear to be little knots wrapped close around\r\n  it--they are really far from each other and from the sun--will\r\n  become rounded worlds like ours. They will be forced into roundness\r\n  by their own gravity, pulling toward their centers. They don't look\r\n  any farther apart than the strands in a little sister's braided\r\n  hair, do they? But remember how small this picture is compared with\r\n  what it represents. What here show as little dark lines, separating\r\n  the embryo worlds, are in reality vast spaces, like those you see\r\n  between the stars at night--millions and millions and millions of\r\n  miles!\r\n]\r\n\r\nSo, you see, the myth story of Phaeton foreshadowed, in a way, the\r\nscience story of Laplace. For, according to the Laplace theory, the\r\nworld _was_ on fire; and a big rain storm, lasting for ages, with\r\nplenty of thunder and lightning, did help put it out.\r\n\r\nThis theory of Laplace was long accepted as the true one. Indeed, it\r\nwas only yesterday, comparatively, that other explanations were offered\r\nas to how we came to have a world to stand on. The broadest of these\r\nnew theories--the one that undertakes to explain the most--is that of\r\nProfessor Chamberlin, of the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUN AND HIS PEBBLE WORLDS\r\n\r\n  However the worlds of our solar system may have been made, when\r\n  they were done there was the sun in the centre and his worlds\r\n  travelling around him in their ordered orbits. Nearest the sun is\r\n  Mercury. Then Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus; then,\r\n  finally, Neptune nearly 3,000,000,000 miles away and with an orbit\r\n  so big that Christmas comes only once in 60,000 years!\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nYOU CAN SEE THESE WORLDS IN THE MAKING\r\n\r\nOwing to the more powerful telescopes of to-day, and the amount of\r\nexploring among the worlds that has been going on since the time of\r\nLaplace, several things have been discovered that have brought his\r\ntheory into question. For one thing, many more nebulæ have been found\r\nin space than were known when Laplace worked out his great conception,\r\nand among them all not one has been found with a central mass\r\nsurrounded by a ring. Moreover, our sharp-eyed telescopes show that\r\nSaturn's ring, which Laplace thought was a solid mass, is really made\r\nup of a great number of small satellites: baby worlds. The greater\r\nnumber of these nebulæ are like the ones you see in the illustration\r\non page 5. They consist of very bright centres with spirals streaming\r\nout from opposite sides. Just take a look at the picture. Doesn't the\r\nshape of those spirals suggest that the central mass is whirling? And\r\nnotice the little white lumps here and there. The thinner, veil-like\r\nportions of the mass, as well as the \"lumps,\" are supposed to be made\r\nof particles of matter, but the lumps to be more condensed. All the\r\nparticles, big and little, are known to be revolving about the central\r\nmass, much as the earth revolves about the sun. The little white lumps,\r\nor knots, in the filmy skein are supposed to be worlds in the making.\r\nBeing larger than the other particles, they draw the smaller to them,\r\naccording to the same law of gravitation which makes every unsupported\r\nthing on earth fall to the ground, because the earth is so much bigger\r\nthan anything there is on it. Since these bright little lumps behave\r\nso much like the worlds we know as planets, and yet are relatively\r\nso small, they are called planetessimals, or \"little planets.\" So\r\nProfessor Chamberlin's idea of the origin of worlds is known as the\r\n\"planetessimal theory.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW YOU CAN WATCH THE WORLD TURN ROUND\r\n\r\n  Timepieces, you know, are really machines for keeping track of the\r\n  apparent movement of the sun. Here is a device, as simple as a\r\n  sun-dial and much simpler than a clock, by which you can record the\r\n  actual motion of the earth. Sprinkle the surface of the water in a\r\n  bowl with chalk dust. On this, sift from a piece of paper powdered\r\n  charcoal or pencil dust, so as to make a clean-cut band extending\r\n  across the centre and over the edge of the bowl. In the course of\r\n  several hours you will find that the black band has swept round\r\n  from east to west, because the water has stood still while the bowl\r\n  has been carried from west to east by the whirling world.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory the earth was once a mere baby world like\r\nthose white lumps, and grew by gathering in its smaller neighbors from\r\ntime to time by the power of gravitation. The larger it grew the more\r\nparticles of solid matter it could draw to itself. Then it drew larger\r\nmasses, for with increased mass came an increased pull of gravity. In\r\nthe same way the earth is still growing, for it is thought that the\r\nshooting stars or meteors we see at night are little planets being\r\ngathered in.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. How the Continents Came Up Out of the Sea\r\n\r\nAnd before I got to be myself at all, while I was still only a part of\r\nthe big pebble called the Earth, your geography and I lay at the bottom\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nFor ages and ages!\r\n\r\nThis is one of the stories you will find in the literature of science,\r\nof how, along with North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa,\r\nand Australia--have I left out any?--I came to land and brought your\r\ngeography with me.\r\n\r\nI remember hearing a pretty young lady say, once upon a time:\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said she, \"I'm through with geography forever!\"\r\n\r\nYou see, although she had passed with marks around 90, she still had\r\nthe idea that geography is a book. You and I know, of course, that the\r\nreal geography isn't a book at all. It's the world itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTTING THE CONTINENTS ON THE GLOBE\r\n\r\nBut there was a time when there was no land. It was all water, and\r\nthe continents were lifted into their places, much as you model a\r\ncontinent in making a relief map; they were sketched out and then\r\nfilled in. North America, for example. First of all up came that mass\r\nin the northeast in what is now Canada; the Laurentian Highlands, as\r\nthey are called in your geography. They rose very, very slowly, you\r\nunderstand, only a few feet in a thousand years; for Nature has all\r\nthe time there is and never hurries. These highlands (they are really\r\ngranite mountains worn down), along with the other rock formations of\r\nour continent, are supposed to be the oldest land on the earth. The\r\ncontinents of Europe and the rest were born later. So you see Columbus\r\ndidn't discover the New World at all; he really came from the New World\r\nand discovered the Old!\r\n\r\nNext after the highlands north of the St. Lawrence up came the tops of\r\nthe mountains you see running along the eastern coast, what we now\r\ncall the Appalachians. Then the Rocky Mountains began to raise their\r\nheads and looked eastward toward their brother mountains across a great\r\nmediterranean sea, the bottom of which is now the Mississippi Valley.\r\nMediterranean means \"middle of the land.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW YOUR GEOGRAPHY ROSE OUT OF THE SEA]\r\n\r\n\r\nADMITTING NEW STATES TO THE MAP\r\n\r\nWisconsin, into which I moved from the Laurentian Highlands in later\r\nyears, was on the lower end of a long, thin tongue of rock reaching out\r\nfrom these highlands to the southwest. While Wisconsin went on growing,\r\nthe Alleghanies came up and brought some Middle Atlantic geography with\r\nthem. Up with all these early settler mountains came, in the course of\r\ntime, the beginnings of neighbor States. All these big, barren rocks\r\n(as they were then), rising and ever rising, age after age, spread\r\nmore surface to the sun. And the sun, and the wind, and the frost,\r\nfollowed by the lowest forms of plant life--the Adams of the vegetable\r\nworld--gradually worked the surface of the rock into soil; and so, as\r\nwe may say, got ready for the spring plowing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDS THE SEA HAS SWALLOWED\r\n\r\n  Parts of the continents as they used to be but which are now\r\n  beneath the waters are here shown. Compare this with the globe map\r\n  in your geography. It is estimated that there are 10,000,000 square\r\n  miles of this land. You'll hear more about this swallowing habit of\r\n  the sea in Chapter X; but, as you will learn, there's nothing to be\r\n  frightened about.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy this constant rising and building on of the soil the foundations\r\nof our States grew out toward one another in order, according to the\r\nconstitution of things, \"to form a more perfect union.\" The United\r\nStates, at a time which, we may say, corresponds to \"The Expansion\r\nPeriod\" in your school history, grew southward from Wisconsin and\r\nwestward from the Appalachians until they made continuous land; and\r\nthere was your Ohio and Indiana and the rest of the North Central\r\ngroup. Below, toward the south, were more big stone islands here\r\nand there, the first sketches or blockings out of the Southern\r\nStates. Florida seems to have been added later, as a final touch; an\r\nafterthought, as one of my Wisconsin neighbors puts it. And it was\r\nmuch enlarged by those remarkable little world builders, the corals.\r\nMexico and Central America, of course, are a part of the Rocky Mountain\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From Gilbert and Brigham's \"An Introduction to Physical\r\n  Geography.\" By permission of D. Appleton and Company_\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT WON'T WE GO UNDER AGAIN?\r\n\r\n  These little people of the sea-floor furnish one of the most\r\n  assuring evidences we have that although the continents rose out of\r\n  the sea, they will never go under the sea again. These are shell\r\n  creatures found in the slime dredged from the bottom of the deepest\r\n  parts of the sea. The shells of creatures that live near shore are\r\n  found in abundance in our rocks, but these types are found only\r\n  in the deepest seas. So, since the deep down-wrinklings of the\r\n  earth that make the sea-basins have never risen, it is probable\r\n  they never will; and consequently that the up-wrinkles--the\r\n  continents--will continue to stay above the waters.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt's a wonderful old story, isn't it? But more wonderful still, it\r\nalways seemed to me, is the story of how they found all this out.\r\n\r\nWho do you suppose first told about it? The last people you would ever\r\nthink of, I'm sure--the oysters!\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE OYSTERS TOLD XENOPHANES\r\n\r\nIt sounds like a passage from \"Alice in Wonderland,\" or \"Through the\r\nLooking-Glass,\" doesn't it? But it's a fact. Away back, more than\r\n2,000 years ago, a wise Greek called Xenophanes, who lived in a place\r\ncalled Colophon, and so was called Xenophanes of Colophon, said that he\r\nthought the rocks of the mountain sides must once have been under the\r\nsea because of the oyster shells that were found embedded in many of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE OYSTERS TOLD THE GREAT SECRET\r\n\r\n  Here is a good example of the thing that led wise old Xenophanes of\r\n  Colophon to make the startling assertion that the mountains were\r\n  once at the bottom of the sea. These are the shells of oysters\r\n  embedded in limestone--which, by the way, the shells of the oysters\r\n  themselves helped make--and this piece of stone is from the top of\r\n  a high mountain.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\"For,\" said Xenophanes of Colophon, \"how else could the oyster shells\r\nhave got there? Who ever heard of oysters climbing a mountain?\"\r\n\r\nAnother evidence that lands come up out of the sea is this: Even before\r\nthe days of Scott and Maryatt and Fenimore Cooper, men--and, of course,\r\nboys--were interested in caves that face upon the sea. They are such\r\njolly places for pirates, and for boys playing pirate, and for mermaids\r\ndrying their hair. It was plain that down where the waves in storms\r\ncould reach them the sea itself bored out these caves. But how about\r\nthose caves in the cliffs high above the waves? The sea must have made\r\nthem, too, once upon a time when the land was lower in the water. Then\r\nthe land was raised.\r\n\r\nStill more striking was the fact that not only caves but old sea\r\nbeaches were found on hill and mountain slopes far from the sea,\r\nsometimes hundreds of miles inland. You can tell the old beaches by\r\ntheir shape and the way in which the pebbles are sorted by size, just\r\nas you find them on beaches to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAKED APPLE AND THE BULGING WORLD\r\n\r\nThe causes of the rise and fall of the sea coasts are many, and\r\nthere are things about these movements not yet understood. By what\r\nwonderful machinery, then (we might naturally ask), were the continents\r\nthemselves lifted out of the sea? To this, which would seem much the\r\nharder question of the two, the answer is simple; as simple as a baked\r\napple. You know an apple that goes into the oven with a smooth, neat\r\nskin comes out covered with wrinkles. Now suppose, instead of a little,\r\nhot apple, covered with a thin skin, you have a big, hot earth covered\r\nwith a thick crust of stone, and the inside of the earth shrinking all\r\nthe time as the inside of the apple shrank away from its skin. The rock\r\nskin would wrinkle, and the wrinkles, rising out of the seas that then\r\ncovered it everywhere, would make continents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RISE AND FALL OF JUPITER SERAPIS\r\n\r\n  In this account of the ups and downs of land and sea I must tell\r\n  you the story of Jupiter Serapis. In the days of the Romans this\r\n  temple, for his honor, stood on the seashore near Naples. Of that\r\n  temple only three pillars remain, but they answer a very important\r\n  question. On these pillars, over twenty feet above sea-level, is a\r\n  belt of holes bored in the stone by a certain shelled sea-creature,\r\n  one of the barnacle family; so evidently these pillars must, at\r\n  some time, have sunk, as shown in the second picture, and then\r\n  risen again, as shown in the third, which represents them as they\r\n  stand to-day.\r\n\r\n  Another interesting thing is that the third picture--observe--shows\r\n  a volcano that isn't in the other two. Following a series of\r\n  earthquake shocks in 1538 the earth opened and out popped hot\r\n  stones and ashes and built themselves into a small volcano right\r\n  before everybody; for it was all done in a short time, and you may\r\n  be sure the frightened people kept their eyes on it, and they named\r\n  it Monte Nuovo, which is Italian for \"New Mountain.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n\"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together\r\ninto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the planetessimal theory the way in which the seas were\r\nmade was this:\r\n\r\nOwing to the collision--the \"bang\"--of the planetessimals against the\r\nearth, and against each other as they met at the \"terminal station,\"\r\nheat was generated. The compression, the squeezing together, of the\r\nearth from its own weight--the gravity pull of the whole mass toward\r\nthe centre--generated still more heat, and the heat and pressure drove\r\nthe gases out of the rock. These gases included hydrogen and oxygen.\r\nThese two gases cooling and combining themselves, in a way they have,\r\nbecame water, and there were other gases, such as nitrogen and carbon\r\ngas, that helped to make the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN THE SEAS WERE ALL IN THE SKY\r\n\r\nAt first the water was in the form of dense clouds of overhanging vapor\r\nwhich, growing bigger and bigger, finally fell in rain. The heat, made\r\nby the pressure of the outside of the earth toward the centre as the\r\nearth kept growing, caused volcanic explosions. But there were far\r\nmore volcanoes in those early days when the earth was settling down,\r\nand being \"settled up,\" as it were, by these energetic pioneers in the\r\nfields of space--the planetessimals--and the surface became pitted\r\nwith craters. In these great catch basins the rain was stored, and,\r\nas for ages the rain kept falling faster than the vapor rose from the\r\nearth, many of these bodies of water united, and so formed the lakes,\r\nthe river systems, the oceans, and the seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR GREAT FEATURES OF THE BIBLE STORY\r\n\r\nAll of which, while it differs so much from the theory of Laplace, does\r\nnot affect the Bible outline of the origin of the earth. For these four\r\ngreat things must still have been: (1) an earth without form, and void;\r\n(2) a great deep; (3) upon its face darkness from the continuing masses\r\nof black rain-laden clouds which overhung it and shut out the sun; (4)\r\nthe final dividing up of supply between the vapor of the clouds (\"the\r\nwaters above the earth\") and \"the waters upon the earth,\" so that at\r\nlast the dark cloud curtain disappeared, and the sun began to rule the\r\nday. \"Let there be light.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut good-by to Phaeton and the story of an original glowing ball which\r\ncooled off on the outside. If the earth grew bit by bit instead of\r\nbeing whirled off in one fiery mass by the sun it was never any hotter\r\nthan it is now, if as hot. It grew hot by being pressed together by its\r\nown weight, and by the blows of additional little worlds as they fell\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nBut on one thing everybody agrees, that the rocks, as you go toward the\r\nearth's centre, have been and still are in a molten state; that this\r\nrock, when it cools, becomes granite, all full of little crystals like\r\na lump of sugar, and that the Granites are one of the F. F. E.'s.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: First Families on Earth.]\r\n\r\nI, as you see, am a Granite. So, besides going through fire and\r\nwater--yes, and ice, as you will learn--and having many strange and\r\nwearing adventures both by land and sea--I'm \"awfully\" old. Older than\r\nyou think. I looked it up in the family record called the \"Geological\r\nColumn\"--just the other day. That column gives my age as \"80+.\" This\r\nmeans I'm 80,000,000 years old, going on 81! (The _plus_ sign, in\r\ngeology language, means \"going on\"; or, \"and then some,\" as a certain\r\nslangful high school freshman puts it.)\r\n\r\nBut I don't think I _show_ my age. Do you?\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  Who wants to sit and be talked to all the time? When boys and girls\r\n  are playing games, the greatest pleasure is in taking part, and\r\n  it's the same way in the Wonderland of Books. Books mean most to\r\n  those who \"get into the game\"; who help chase after the answers to\r\n  things. This hunting for answers up and down among the books is one\r\n  of the interesting games we're going to play; and those of you who\r\n  don't come in will miss a lot of fun. That's all _I've_ got to say!\r\n  Let's begin like this:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  In the Greek myth stories what else was Mr. Apollo supposed to do\r\n  for the world and its people besides turning on the light?[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Answers to all these questions at the ends of chapters\r\nwill be found in books you can easily get hold of--encyclopædias,\r\ndictionaries, and school-books; or books usually found in home, school,\r\nor public libraries. Words in parenthesis or italics indicate the\r\nheadings where the information referred to will be found.]\r\n\r\n  Why doesn't the force of the earth, whirling along as it does at 19\r\n  miles a second, cause the wind to blow us all away? (_Earth._)\r\n\r\n  What is the difference between a planet and a sun?\r\n\r\n  How does the earth compare in size with its brother planets of the\r\n  sun family?\r\n\r\n  How often would Christmas come around if we lived on the moon?\r\n\r\n  What causes different phases of the moon?\r\n\r\n  Why may we be said to have eclipses of the moon every month?\r\n\r\n  \"Moon\" and \"month\" sound a good deal alike when you come to think\r\n  of it. Don't you wonder why? \"Moon\" comes from a word meaning \"to\r\n  measure.\" You'll find the rest of the word-story of the moon in any\r\n  dictionary that is big enough to tell about the origin of words.\r\n\r\n  By the way--speaking of the timekeepers in the sky--don't forget\r\n  to look up the lives of the great astronomers mentioned in this\r\n  chapter. You will find, among other things, how Galileo, when only\r\n  eighteen years of age, helped to give us our clocks and watches by\r\n  counting his pulse-beats while watching a hanging lamp swing back\r\n  and forth in the Cathedral of Pisa; how he found out who \"The Man\r\n  in the Moon\" really is and what the \"Milky Way\" is made of; how he\r\n  invented the wonderful glass for playing hide and seek among the\r\n  worlds, and with it found four moons in one night!\r\n\r\n  Yes, and how do you suppose he found that the sun is going round\r\n  and round like a top, just as the earth does? It was the _simplest_\r\n  thing! You'll see!\r\n\r\n  Old Father Science may be said to be a Santa Claus who keeps a\r\n  curiosity-shop. His pack is not only full of curious things but he\r\n  is always \"springing surprises on us,\" as our High School Boy puts\r\n  it. For example, one of the most curious as well as picturesque\r\n  evidences that great stretches of land sink under the sea from\r\n  time to time is furnished by the English swallows. Like many other\r\n  wealthy people, they spend their winters in Algiers, and they find\r\n  their way over the Mediterranean, not by any lands they can see\r\n  between coast and coast--for there _are_ none--but by lands that\r\n  _used_ to be there, thousands upon thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\n  But how do the swallows know? They don't. Is it instinct? No.\r\n  (Whatever instinct is!) Then why do they do it? Look it up and\r\n  you'll see.[6] Yes, and you'll see that we have habits that _we_\r\n  get in the same way; our habits of bowing, for example, because\r\n  it's the custom, although few people know how it originated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: \"Colin Clout's Calendar,\" by Grant Allen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                              (FEBRUARY)\r\n\r\n    Up rose the wild old Winter King\r\n    And shook his beard of snow;\r\n    \"I hear the first young harebell ring,\r\n    'Tis time for me to go!\r\n    Northward o'er the icy rocks,\r\n    Northward o'er the Sea.\"\r\n\r\n                                                            --_Leland._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINTER THAT LASTED ALL SUMMER\r\n\r\nIt's been just one thing after another with the world and me ever since\r\nwe were born. First it was the fire, then it was the flood, and then it\r\nwas the winter that lasted all summer.\r\n\r\nJust what started it nobody knows to this day. Some of the theories\r\nhave been that this particular winter stayed so long because the earth\r\nwavered on its axis, or that it flew the track for a while and got too\r\nfar away from the sun. From our present knowledge of the machinery of\r\nthe heavens it is certain that the earth's motions could not vary to\r\nthis extent. One theory that appeals to many scientists to-day is that\r\nwhen so much of the carbon in the air went into the making of our coal\r\nbeds the earth became unusually cold, and so snows of each successive\r\nwinter kept piling up instead of melting away during the spring and\r\nsummer. When there is plenty of this gas in the air the earth's heat\r\ndoes not escape so fast. But with the great amount of carbon taken up\r\nin the growth of the vast forests that were made into coal, Mother\r\nEarth's air blanket grew thinner, so to speak, hence the long, cold\r\nspell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From Norton's \"Elements of Geology.\" By permission of Ginn and\r\n  Company_\r\n\r\nWHEN THE ICE SHEETS COVERED THE LAND]\r\n\r\nBut whatever caused it one thing is certain; it was a winter that beat\r\nanything the oldest inhabitant ever saw; for the cave men are known to\r\nhave been on earth during this great winter, which is known as the Ice\r\nAge or the Glacial Period. A great big ice cap reached from the North\r\nPole far down into the Temperate Zone in North America, Europe, and\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE CAVEMAN'S DIARY\r\n\r\n  This is a little note on the Ice Age from the caveman's diary--the\r\n  picture of a mammoth scratched with a flint on a mammoth's tusk.\r\n  You can see how the artist kept trying for the true form with\r\n  different lines, as all real artists do. Artists don't just have a\r\n  kind of sign that stands for the thing--like a little boy's picture\r\n  of a man that he always makes in just one way. Notice the action,\r\n  the natural motion of the animal. The artist means to say: \"This is\r\n  the way he came at me.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Mild Spell and the Menageries\r\n\r\nJust before this dreadful winter set in we had a long, open spell;\r\nabout a million years or so. It was just like summer most of the year\r\nin the temperate zone, and much warmer than it is to-day in what is now\r\nthe land of the little frosty Eskimo.\r\n\r\nThere weren't any little Eskimos in those days. In fact, there wasn't\r\nmuch of anything that was little. Everything was on a big scale. Think\r\nof a mud-turtle twelve feet long! He was all of that. His skull alone\r\nwas a yard long and he must have weighed a couple of tons. He had for\r\nneighbors in the bordering swamps a number of huge creatures that one\r\nwouldn't care to meet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KING OF THE DINOSAURS AT LUNCHEON\r\n\r\n  Contrast the little, almost dainty, fore limbs with the enormous\r\n  legs. You can't help thinking of the arms of a human being, can\r\n  you? In fact, this mixed-up creature looks as if nature were even\r\n  then dreaming of man, the quadruped who, as some Frenchman said,\r\n  \"took to walking on his hind legs that he might conquer the world.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nDREADFULNESS OF MR. DINOSAUR\r\n\r\nThe Dinosaur, for instance. His name means \"terrible reptile.\" Some\r\nmembers of the family were, indeed, terrible creatures. Just see\r\nthis one at lunch, Mr. Ceratosaurus. He has the head of a queer\r\nhorse--\"probably a night mare,\" says the High School Boy--teeth\r\nand tail and belly scales like a crocodile, a comb that suggests a\r\nrooster's, legs like an ostrich, the talons of an eagle, and the dainty\r\nlittle arms of a child. What a combination! Those small fore limbs were\r\nused only for grasping. On his hind legs he stalked about, seeking\r\nwhom he might eat for dinner. He was about fifty feet long when he was\r\nall there. At this late day scientists usually find only parts of him\r\nscattered around.\r\n\r\nThese Dinosaurs came in sizes and differed considerably as to looks and\r\neating and getting about. Some were as small as cats, some walked on\r\nfour legs, some--like the gentleman at lunch--walked on two. Some were\r\nstrict vegetarians, while others would have nothing but meat. The Big\r\nBoys of the whole tribe were called the Sauropoda or reptile-footed\r\nDinosaurs. One of these, whose bones were found in Colorado, was\r\nsixty-five feet long when complete, and he must have weighed around\r\ntwenty tons. His family nickname was Diplodocus or \"Double Beam,\"\r\nbecause of his long, beam-like neck and his long, beam-like tail.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTLE MR. DIPLODOCUS AND HIS WAYS\r\n\r\nConsidering the reputation some of the other Dinosaurs had as bad\r\ncitizens, it is only fair to the Diplodocus to say that he was really a\r\ngentle creature, and never disturbed anybody--unless somebody disturbed\r\nhim first. Then he would give them a switch with that tail of his,\r\nand it was a switching they were not likely to forget. But his great\r\ndelight--indeed, his main occupation in life--was to sit deep in the\r\nwater, prop himself up with his great long tail, like a kangaroo, with\r\njust his head out, like a turtle in a pond. Then he would strain little\r\nwater bugs and similar things through his teeth. He got his meals in\r\nthis way, very much as the whales do now.\r\n\r\nAnd elephants! You ought to have seen some of the members of the\r\nelephant family that arrived after the reptile age, the mammoths, for\r\ninstance. These huge creatures and many other strange animals were all\r\nover the place. It was just like a circus day everywhere all the time.\r\nSuch elephants don't travel with circuses now, of course, because they\r\nwere all killed during that dreadful winter, but you can see them in\r\nmuseums, all dressed in their skeletons and neatly held together with\r\nwires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From the mural painting by Charles R. Knight in the American\r\n  Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nWHEN ELEPHANTS WORE UNDERCLOTHES\r\n\r\n  This painting on the walls of the American Museum of Natural\r\n  History in New York City shows herds of reindeer and mammoths in\r\n  the Ice Age. They didn't mind the cold as elephants do to-day,\r\n  because of their woolly underclothes. They fed on the shoots and\r\n  cones of those firs and pines. The reindeer, then as now, ate the\r\n  lichens we call \"reindeer moss,\" first scraping away the snow with\r\n  their feet.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE MAMMOTHS PASSED AWAY\r\n\r\nPicture herds of these mammoths huddled together like sheep in dark\r\nravines, and the blinding snow, swept down by the winds, burying them\r\ndeeper and deeper. That was how they died. You'll notice that they\r\nwore their hair long, while the elephants we see in the circuses or at\r\nthe zoo have hardly any hair at all. This long hair was part of their\r\nwinter clothing. Under it they wore a close fleece. But this winter was\r\nso severe and it lasted so long that even their heavy woollen underwear\r\ncouldn't save them. Sometimes there would be a thaw, but this was only\r\non the surface and helped turn the snow into ice. And winter piled on\r\nwinter and on the bodies of the mammoths until they were buried under\r\ntons and tons of snow and ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE SNOW CHANGED ITSELF INTO ICE\r\n\r\nYou know snow will get solid, like ice, where it is under pressure, and\r\nit will make hard cakes and ice balls under your shoes. Well, this snow\r\nof the long winter just \"packed its own self\" (as a small boy might\r\nsay) into ice. It did this by piling on and piling on. The weight of\r\nthe snow above and behind, in the spaces between the mountains and in\r\nthe mountain valleys, pressed with enormous force on the snow below and\r\nin front.\r\n\r\nThen what do you think this ice did? It began to move. And of all the\r\nthings it did from then on!\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Marvellous Changes in the Old Home Place\r\n\r\nDid you notice those scratches on my face? The ice did that. But,\r\nof course, that's nothing in itself. And, besides, I'm not one to\r\ncomplain, as you know. I only speak of it to show what big things may\r\nbe back of little ones, how much you can learn from the study of so\r\ncommon a thing as a little pebble. For the very same ice fields that\r\nscratched the faces of little pebbles like me deepened the gorges and\r\ncanyons among the mountains and shaved the crowns of the old ones--Bald\r\nMountain, in the Adirondacks, for example. They carried off good\r\nfarming soil by the thousands of acres from one place and piled it in\r\nanother; they shoved the Mississippi River back and forth; in fact,\r\nturned many streams out of their courses--some of them the other end\r\nto, so that they now flow south where they used to flow north. They\r\ntook old river systems apart, and with the pieces made new ones--the\r\nbig Missouri for one. They set Niagara Falls up in business; got all\r\nthe waterfalls ready that are now turning the wheels of New England\r\nfactories, and even put in great water storage systems that remind one\r\nof the Salt River irrigation works, with their big Roosevelt dam in\r\nArizona, or of the reservoirs which England built in the Nile. Lakes\r\nin river systems act as reservoirs, you know, and make them flow more\r\nevenly, thus keeping the power of falls more uniform, as in the case\r\nof Niagara, and making a uniform depth of water for vessels, as in the\r\ncase of the St. Lawrence River. The Great Lakes do both of these useful\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From Norton's \"Elements of Geology.\" By permission of\r\nGinn and Company_\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE MOUNTAIN IN THE BIG CITY\r\n\r\nIn one of the parks in New York City you can see this illustration of\r\nhow the glaciers rounded off the mountain-tops.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEEHIVE MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\nThis huge mass in the Canadian Rockies is known as the Beehive\r\nMountain. Originally a cliff, it was reshaped by the glaciers. Can't\r\nyou tell from the picture which was the face of the cliff, and from the\r\ninformation in the text which side the glacier climbed up and on which\r\nside it tobogganed down?]\r\n\r\nThere were three great centres--union stations, we might call\r\nthem--from which the ice trains moved out. These were the points at\r\nwhich the ice gathered to the greatest depth, the tops of the great\r\nsnow banks. One, as you see by our Ice Age map, was away over on the\r\nPacific Coast of Canada. It is called the Cordilleran Centre, from\r\nthe vast mountain system of which it is a part. Over what is now the\r\nprovince of Keewatin, Canada, was the Keewatin Centre, while the\r\nLabrador Centre stood guard over the highlands of Labrador. The ice\r\nfrom the Keewatin and Labrador fields, you notice, flowed farthest to\r\nthe south. The Keewatin ice giant travelled away down the Mississippi\r\nValley as far as the mouth of what is now the Missouri, while the\r\ngiant from Labrador got nearly to the mouth of the Ohio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD MEN OF THE MOUNTAIN AT THEIR WORK\r\n\r\nDon't you always think of a glacier as a big white thing? So it is\r\nwhen it starts to work, but after it has ploughed down the mountain\r\nvalleys and gathered up a lot of soil--such as the heaps you see in the\r\nforeground of the picture--it begins to look as black as a coal-heaver!\r\nIt gets cracked up into all sorts of odd shapes, too. Doesn't that\r\nfigure near the centre look like some queer kind of old elephant, with\r\na fierce white eye (it's a big stone) and a snarl on his face?]\r\n\r\nThe reason Old Mr. Labrador didn't reach the mouth of the Ohio--as\r\nyou can easily guess--was that he didn't go far enough, but could you\r\nanswer a conundrum like this:\r\n\r\n\"Why was Mr. Keewatin bound to reach the mouth of the Missouri and stay\r\nthere for awhile no matter how far he went?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer is easy, when you know it. Because he made the Missouri\r\nhimself. What we now know as the Missouri River was made of other\r\nrivers that the big ice sheet turned around as it advanced and of the\r\nwater from the ice as the glacier melted its way back home. It was\r\nsomething like Mary and the little lamb, all the time, so long as Mr.\r\nKeewatin travelled south; for everywhere he went the Missouri was\r\n_sure_ to go, because he kept pushing it ahead of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE OLD MEN PUSHED THE MISSISSIPPI ABOUT\r\n\r\nAs the ice sheets pushed into its valleys, now from the northeast and\r\nnow from the northwest, the Mississippi River was pushed back and forth\r\nas if it were a--well, as if it weren't anything! It is known that the\r\nMississippi was pushed out of bed by this burly guest from the north\r\nbecause its former channels have been traced along the old ice fronts.\r\n\r\nIn one part of its course the Mississippi actually got misplaced, and\r\nhasn't found its way back to its old bed to this day. This you can\r\nsee at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. At that point the Minnesota River\r\nflows in the Mississippi's old valley--which is plainly too big for\r\nit--while above Fort Snelling the Mississippi is forced to squeeze its\r\nway through a stingy little gorge that used to belong to the Minnesota,\r\nand I'm sure would be plenty big enough for it now. It's like the story\r\nof a changeling baby in a fairy tale, isn't it? Only in the fairy tale\r\nthe changeling always gets back to his old home, while the misplaced\r\nMississippi in Minnesota doesn't.\r\n\r\nBut the glaciers made it up to the Mississippi, in a way, for this rude\r\njostling. They not only left it an enormous extra supply of water as\r\nthey melted back home--what would a river be without water?--but they\r\nactually took some smaller rivers away from the St. Lawrence and made\r\nthem do their pouring into the Mississippi system. Although they didn't\r\nowe the Ohio any apology for anything, so far as I know, they did the\r\nsame thing for it, just to be good fellows, I suppose. All the rivers\r\nthat now empty into the Ohio above Cincinnati used to flow into Lake\r\nErie, but the glaciers turned them south and they've gone on obediently\r\nflowing that way ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLOWMAN WHO PLOWED THE FARMS AWAY\r\n\r\nThat these giants of the north, although they must have looked as cold\r\nas ice, really had good hearts is shown by the way Old Mr. Labrador\r\ntreated New England when he went Down East. New England was at that\r\ntime covered with good, deep, rich soil, the decay of the granite rocks\r\nthat had been basking in the sun for ages and growing early grass and\r\nvegetables for the live stock of those days. Then along came Old Mr.\r\nLabrador with his plow, and set to work. But he plowed so deep that he\r\nplowed all the farms away! Of the gigantic furrows that he turned a\r\nlot of the slices fell over into New York State; but some, I'm sorry\r\nto say, dropped off into the sea. This left New England in a bad way,\r\nso far as prizes for farm produce at the country fairs a few thousand\r\nyears later were concerned.\r\n\r\nBut then what do you suppose Mr. Labrador did, the good old soul? He\r\ntook a lot of streams that had been flowing north, blocked them up\r\nwith pebbles and dirt, making them turn right around and flow south,\r\nso that in climbing down from the rocks in these new unworn beds they\r\nmade waterfalls. And it was from the power made by its waterfalls, you\r\nknow, as your geography tells you, that New England grew to be a great\r\n\"manu-factur-ing\" section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Courtesy of \"The Scientific American.\"_\r\n\r\nHOW THE OLD MEN OF THE MOUNTAIN COME TO SCHOOL\r\n\r\nYou can have glaciers like this right in the schoolroom, and icebergs,\r\ntoo, by means of which the Old Men of the Mountain went to sea. Both\r\nthe iceberg and its parent, the glacier, are made by the crumpling of\r\nwhite paper around books or any other support. Cliffs of dark-brown\r\ngrocery-paper bound the deep gully through which the glacier has\r\ncrept down to the sea. The sea-waves are made with crumpled paper of\r\nappropriate colors. (Think what lovely green waves you could make\r\nwith a piece of old window-shade!) Pieces of white string make good\r\nbreakers, and powdered chalk can easily be made to turn to snow.]\r\n\r\nOf course I'm only joking when I speak of these glaciers as if they\r\nhad minds like the rest of us, but really it almost seems true, when\r\nyou come to think of all the things they did. Take these New England\r\nwaterfalls, for instance. The glacier not only made them by turning\r\nthe rivers around, but, as the ice melted away toward the north the\r\nland rose again, being relieved of the enormous weight. And in rising\r\nthe sloping land not only gave more force to the new southward flowing\r\nstreams but made it more sure that they should _go on_ flowing south.\r\nAs if the glaciers said:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAY TEMPLE OF THE WINDS\r\n\r\n  This gray mass of sandstone on the Wisconsin prairies is a piece of\r\n  architecture with which man has had nothing whatever to do. It is\r\n  all the work of the winds and the rains; of the sea and of rivers;\r\n  of water and rivers of ice; and the vertical division of the rock\r\n  into joints by the shrinking of the earth. The detail, the rounding\r\n  of the pillars, and so on, is largely the work of the winds and\r\n  their helpers, the frosts, the rains, and the wind-blown sand.\r\n\r\n  The original mass was carved out of a big rock-bed by flowing\r\n  rivers that had their course around it on either side. Then one\r\n  of these rivers was dammed by ice in the days of the glaciers and\r\n  a lake was formed in which this rock mass stood as an island.\r\n  The level prairie you now see around it was made by the sand and\r\n  gravel deposited in the bottom of this lake. The vertical divisions\r\n  are cracks in the earth crust called \"joints.\" The horizontal\r\n  divisions are due in part to this cracking process and in part to\r\n  \"stratification,\" the layer-like arrangement of the rocks when laid\r\n  in the bottom of the sea, as explained in Chapter X. The \"cornice\"\r\n  is a layer of harder rock which has yielded less to nature's tools.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\"I've turned you around and I want you to stay turned around. And I\r\nwant you to go on running south and dropping over the falls until the\r\npeople of New England come down to Lowell and Manchester and those\r\nplaces and get ready to put you to work.\"\r\n\r\nAnyhow, that's just what happened. You can look at it any way you want\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIt was in much the same way that Mr. Labrador and his friend Keewatin\r\ndid that great piece of engineering at the Great Lakes. Where the\r\nGreat Lakes are now there used to be rivers that were a part of the\r\nSt. Lawrence system. Then along came the ice sheets, dammed up these\r\nrivers, just as small boys dam up roadside rivulets after a rain, and\r\nso made big lakes, as the boys make little lakes in these streamlets.\r\nBut this wasn't all. The glaciers evidently wanted these to be nice\r\nbig lakes that would stay there for people to ride on in the beautiful\r\nsummer weather, and to help haul coal and iron ore and other kinds of\r\nfreight--Michigan peaches and everything. For look what else they did.\r\nWith pebbles and big stones and dirt they built the lake walls higher,\r\nand dug deep basins for them out of the solid rock. Then they poured in\r\na lot of extra water--beautiful blue water, tons and tons of it--and\r\nwent back home.\r\n\r\nThe digging into the rock was done with big chisels--what a carpenter\r\nwould call \"round-nosed\" chisels. These chisels, of course, were made\r\nof ice. They were what are called the \"tongues\" or \"lobes\" of glaciers.\r\nAs a glacier flows along--always on some down grade--there are portions\r\nof it--those long lobes or tongues--that move on ahead of the main\r\nmass. This is because those parts of the ice sheet strike a steeper\r\nbit of land than the rest of it, so how could they help moving faster?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THOUSAND-YEAR CLOCK AT NIAGARA\r\n\r\n  You've heard of eight-day clocks and clocks that have to be wound\r\n  only once a year, but here is a clock that was wound up several\r\n  thousand years ago and is still going beautifully! In placing the\r\n  wondrous waterfall in Niagara River the glaciers also started a\r\n  kind of water-clock by which to record--for those who would take\r\n  the trouble to study it out--how long ago it was the glaciers\r\n  visited us. Owing to the constant wearing away of the base of the\r\n  falls, by the water grinding the pebbles against it, great blocks\r\n  like the one here shown (known as \"The Rock of Ages\") come tumbling\r\n  down. So the falls are constantly retreating up-stream, and the\r\n  distance from where they once stood to where they are now gives a\r\n  rough idea of the time that has passed since the Old Men of the\r\n  Mountain set them up in business--about 25,000 years.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe fronts of these lobes are rounded like the waves flowing up a\r\nbeach, or syrup travelling over pancakes on a cold winter morning. The\r\nreason of this roundness is that the centres of these lobes of ice or\r\nwater travel fastest because the mass on either side furnishes a kind\r\nof ball-bearing for the central part.\r\n\r\nBut this wasn't all. At the very same time, by the very same act,\r\nLabrador, Keewatin & Co. set Niagara Falls up in business. In those\r\ndays there was a Niagara river but no Niagara Falls; at least not the\r\none we know to-day. The ice filled the Ontario Valley so that the\r\nstreams flowing into it had to turn around and flow south. The Niagara\r\nRiver was one of these streams. Then, as the ice melted, it poured\r\nloads of extra water into Lake Erie, so that it was some 30 feet higher\r\nthan it is at present and began draining out through the new Niagara\r\nRiver, over the rocks that make the falls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF NIAGARA\r\n\r\n  This is a bird's-eye view of the Niagara region. Where the river\r\n  crosses a bed of limestone below Buffalo, and again where it\r\n  crosses another just above the crest of the falls, some of the rock\r\n  has been dissolved away, thus making it rougher, so that slight\r\n  rapids have formed. Then comes the mighty plunge, after which\r\n  the water flows through a gorge for about seven miles. Where the\r\n  gorge bends abruptly at right angles is the great eddy called \"The\r\n  Whirlpool.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE IS THE ART OF GOD\r\n\r\n\"Nature,\" as Sir Thomas Browne so finely said, \"is the art of God.\"\r\nAnd nowhere is this art more striking in its beauty than in the work\r\ndone by the glaciers. Those wonderful falls and the blue inland seas\r\nwe call the Great Lakes, and thousands of smaller lakes scattered all\r\nover where the glaciers came, are only a part of this art work. The\r\nmain ice sheets, you notice, didn't reach down among the mountains\r\nof California, but these mountains had small glaciers of their own\r\nin those days, just as they have now. Only they were much larger\r\nthen because, as we have seen, it was such a snowy time all over the\r\nnorthern world. Listen to what these home-made glaciers of California\r\ndid, and listen to how John Muir tells it:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AND TO THINK WE DID IT ALL!]\r\n\r\n\"It is hard,\" he says, \"without long and loving study, to realize how\r\ngreat was the work done. Before the glaciers came, the range\"--he is\r\nspeaking of the Sierras--\"was comparatively simple; one vast wave of\r\nstone in which a thousand mountains, domes, canyons, ridges, and so\r\nforth lay concealed.\" To carve them out of the stone \"nature chose\r\nfor a tool, not the earthquake or the lightning, but the tender\r\nsnow flowers, noiselessly falling through unnumbered centuries.\r\nThe snowflakes said, 'Come, we are feeble; let us help one another.\r\nMarching in close, deep ranks let us roll away the stones from these\r\nmountain sepulchres, and set the landscape free.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this was all in the Great Plan of things. For the\r\nrocks had to be of a certain kind and laid in a certain way for the\r\nlittle members of this art society of the sky to work these landscapes\r\nout. And the rocks were so made and laid when they were at least a mile\r\nbelow the surface on which the glaciers set to work.\r\n\r\n\"It was while these features were taking form in the depths of the\r\nrange, the particles of the rocks marching to their appointed places\r\nin the dark, that the particles of icy vapor in the sky, marching to\r\nthe same music, assembled to bring them to the light. Then, after their\r\ngrand task was done, these bands of snow flowers, the mighty glaciers,\r\nwere melted and removed, as if of no more importance than dew destined\r\nto last but an hour.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"The Mountains of California.\" John Muir.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  How do you suppose warm water--of all things!--could have caused\r\n  the Ice Age? This theory is one that was offered by a very eminent\r\n  geologist, Doctor Shaler, of Harvard.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: \"Nature and Man in America.\"]\r\n\r\n  In the same book he also explains how the old men of the mountain\r\n  may have helped to make New York City, although they were never\r\n  there in their lives, of course.\r\n\r\n  When you take up geology as a special study--I hope you will--you\r\n  will find that there were five particularly heavy snowfalls during\r\n  the long winter. But why not look it up now? If you can't do it\r\n  just get somebody else in the family to do it for you. Where is\r\n  father's college geology? In the last two of these storms Mr.\r\n  Labrador rode all over New England and clear to the sea, where he\r\n  amused himself for a long time by setting icebergs drifting out\r\n  over the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n  How do they know about the icebergs? That's one of the interesting\r\n  things the books tell.\r\n\r\n  These books also show how Niagara Falls acts as a great time-clock\r\n  that tells how long ago it was since the glaciers visited us.\r\n  According to the record on the \"dial\" it was somewhere between\r\n  20,000 and 30,000 years ago. (Of course this isn't what _we_ would\r\n  call very close timekeeping; but remember, in the long story of the\r\n  earth even a hundred thousand years is a mere tick of the clock.)\r\n\r\n  And the way this clock is running down shows we're going to lose\r\n  Niagara Falls in the course of time. All falls finally run down in\r\n  the same way. This is the rather flippant way my high school friend\r\n  put it:\r\n\r\n  \"First, the water falls over the waterfall; then the waterfall\r\n  falls, piece by piece, and the water falls no more. It's a sad\r\n  case.\"\r\n\r\n  (You'll see what he meant, quickly enough, when you read up on\r\n  waterfalls. Your geography tells, doesn't it? Well, then, of course\r\n  _you_ know.)\r\n\r\n  But here's a question you can answer right out of this chapter.\r\n  Which one of the illustrations shows that the mammoths and the cave\r\n  men lived on earth at the same time?\r\n\r\n  That the mammoth was seen in the flesh by those remarkable artists\r\n  of the caves is plain, but what do you say to seeing a mammoth in\r\n  the flesh in these days? Remember the mammoths have all been dead\r\n  for thousands of years. (_Elephant_, _Mammoth_, _Siberia_.)\r\n\r\n  What is there about the climate of Siberia that made this strange\r\n  thing possible?\r\n\r\n  How did the mammoth get his name? Was it because he was so\r\n  big--such a \"mammoth\" creature?[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Mammoth, you will find, comes from a word meaning \"earth.\"\r\nIt didn't mean \"big\" at all at first. One of the most lovable traits\r\nof a good dictionary, I think, is that it tells so many interesting\r\nlittle stories like that about the early life of words; of their days\r\nof adventure, so to speak, when there was no telling _how_ they would\r\ncome out.]\r\n\r\n  How did the mammoths compare in size with the elephants of to-day?\r\n\r\n  Which was the bigger, the mastodon or the mammoth?\r\n\r\n  Did we ever have mastodons in North America? And were there\r\n  mammoths, too?\r\n\r\n  If you want to see more about what the travelling menageries\r\n  of the days before the Ice Age looked like hunt up these\r\n  words: _Archelon_, _dinosaur_, _ceratosaurus_, _diplodocus_,\r\n  _stegosaurus_, _triceratops_.\r\n\r\n  See what the geography says about the manufacturing towns of New\r\n  England and how many of them have water power.\r\n\r\n  In that remarkable little book by Grant Allen[10] already referred\r\n  to in the H. & S. at the end of Chapter I, on page 139, you will\r\n  find what the Ice Age had to do with the fact that the rabbits of\r\n  Canada and our northern border States wear white clothes in winter,\r\n  while Br'er Rabbit of our Middle and Southern States keeps his\r\n  yellow-brown suit on all the year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: \"Colin Clout's Calendar.\"]\r\n\r\n  And on page 204 how a little plant, whose old home was in the\r\n  Arctics, got stranded on an English hilltop among the mossy clefts\r\n  of weathered granite, and how the beautiful lady who has a little\r\n  flower named after her slipper (we all know that slipper) is\r\n  leaving England because the climate is too mild!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUMMER PASTURES ON THE JUNGFRAU\r\n\r\n  Here are some of those Swiss cattle in their summer pastures.\r\n  Doesn't look much like summer, does it? But there's one thing\r\n  besides the cattle that tells. See that stretch of snow all by\r\n  itself? That's a snow-bank which has escaped the summer sun because\r\n  it is protected by the ravine in which it lies. All around it the\r\n  ground is bare of snow.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                                (MARCH)\r\n\r\n    With rushing winds and gloomy skies\r\n    The dark and stubborn Winter dies;\r\n    Far off, unseen, Spring faintly cries,\r\n    Bidding her earliest child arise.\r\n\r\n                                                     --_Bayard Taylor._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUL OF THE SPRING AND THE LANDS OF ETERNAL SNOW\r\n\r\nAnd that's how the Old Men of the Mountain visited us in the Ice Age\r\nand what they did and how they did it. But now that they have all\r\nbeen back home so long don't you think it would be nice and polite\r\nto return the call--especially when you remember all they did for us,\r\nmaking beautiful lakes and rivers and waterfalls and mountain scenery?\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Springtime in the Alps\r\n\r\nThe best time to do this would be in the spring, because then the\r\nkingdom of the glaciers is most beautiful, and the spirit of a\r\nglorious new world, just waking up, is abroad everywhere. The glaciers\r\nthemselves seem to feel so good about it that they start to sing. And\r\nlike the birds, their joyous springtime mood responds to the quick\r\nchanges of sun and shade. In our own land when the sky grows cloudy,\r\neven for a short time as you may have noticed, birds stop singing.\r\nThen when the sky clears they start up again. But, up here in the Alps\r\nin the spring when the birds are singing among the mountain meadows,\r\nthe glaciers, at whose feet these meadows lie, do the very same thing.\r\nThe songs of the birds are various, and the song of the same bird will\r\ndiffer at different times of day, but the song of the glacier is always\r\nthe same--a pleasant dreamy tune between the murmur of little voices\r\nand the tinkle of distant bells.\r\n\r\nThe very rocks that the glacier carries on its back seem to catch the\r\nspirit of the springtime; for, when the weather is bright, they go\r\nstrolling. And when they do they remind us a little of that painting\r\nby Franz Hals, \"The Laughing Cavalier,\" for they apparently wear a big\r\nbroad-brimmed hat cocked jauntily on one side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UP WHERE THE GLACIERS GROW\r\n\r\n  Here we are, looking down on the roof of the Alps--from a\r\n  flying-machine, let us say. The sky-line used to be more like the\r\n  ridge of a house, straight across. In the course of the ages the\r\n  glaciers and the weather have cut down the softer rock, leaving\r\n  those peaks. At the top are the snow-fields. Farther down the\r\n  glaciers begin to form. Still farther down, where the glaciers have\r\n  begun to melt, you can see a stream--its waters have taken white in\r\n  the picture because of the foam and the ground-up rock in it called\r\n  \"rock flour\"--falling into the woods below, the \"timber line\"\r\n  of your geography. Ruskin has a wonderful word-picture of these\r\n  mountain streams in his \"Modern Painters.\" The index of any edition\r\n  will tell you where.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO DISCOVERED THE ICE AGE\r\n\r\nThe Alps are the most famous of all the homes of the glaciers, not\r\nonly because of the great number of the glaciers and the beauty of\r\nthe scenery, but because it was in the Alps that Agassiz, living in a\r\nlittle stone hut among the mountains, studied the glaciers and their\r\nways and proved that it was these strange creatures of snow and ice\r\nthat had come down during the Ice Age and worked such marvellous\r\nchanges on the face of the earth. In the Alps, just as Muir found them\r\ndoing among the glaciers of Alaska, the flowers bloom at the very edge\r\nof the snow line. And they come on much more rapidly than they do in\r\ntemperate climates. As fast as the snow melts back blossoms just cover\r\nthe meadows thick with the deepest, richest colors--blue, red, white,\r\nyellow, purple, and every shade of these. Some of these flowers are\r\nas pure white as the snows. The queen of beauty among them all, many\r\nthink, is the Alpine rose. In that pure, clear air its color seems\r\nactually to glow like the famous peak, the Jungfrau, at sunrise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS AGASSIZ\r\n\r\nThe great teacher who discovered the Ice Age.]\r\n\r\nOne little flower is in such a hurry, so afraid it will miss the first\r\nMay party, that it blooms under the ice and melts its own way right up\r\nthrough. Then it calls to the bees and the butterflies, in the way that\r\nflowers have:\r\n\r\n\"Good morning! It's spring, and here I am again and how do you do? Come\r\nand kiss me!\"\r\n\r\nThe soldanella grows among the thick pebble beds and the big boulders\r\nright on the edges of the glaciers. It is a member of the primrose\r\nfamily. It may be pink, white, or blue. The blue flowers are most\r\ncommon. But blue, pink, or white, these baby bells are always born\r\ntwins; two sisters side by side on the same stalk, showing their dear\r\nfairy faces just above those layers of ice. They are such delicate\r\nlittle things you wonder how they can ever stand it. But ice, pshaw,\r\nthey don't mind it at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUSHING A WAY THROUGH THE ICE\r\n\r\nIf you are a bashful boy or girl you can understand how the Misses\r\nSoldanella have been able, in spite of their icy covering, to get here\r\nto greet us on this lovely May morning. You know how warm your face\r\nfeels when you blush. It seems to be somewhat the same way with all\r\nflowers when they blush into bloom. The blossom becomes quite a little\r\nwarmer than any other part of the plant. It is the heat of the growing\r\nbuds and, still more, the heat of the blossoms that melts a passage for\r\nthe Soldanellas through the ice, for they often blossom before they get\r\nabove the ice at all.\r\n\r\nThe higher we climb the brighter the flowers, and they grow in thicker\r\nmasses, and each kind spreads out into larger fields than they did\r\nwhere we came from down below--great belts of blue gentians, whole\r\nfields of golden yellow globe flowers. You'd hardly expect this, would\r\nyou? And you'll be still more surprised at the reason. Did you notice,\r\nas shown in their pictures, that the Soldanellas have only the bees for\r\ntheir callers? Just look if you can see any bees where we are now. Not\r\na bee. But butterflies everywhere. And that's the answer. The flowers\r\nof the upper meadows are brighter, grow thicker and spread wider--all\r\non account of the butterflies; to get the butterfly \"trade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY THE BEES GET OUT OF BREATH\r\n\r\nBees can't climb to such heights because the air is very thin, and,\r\ntherefore, harder to fly in. Remember their little bodies are heavy\r\nand their wings are small. They get out of breath, like a fat man with\r\nshort legs working his way up Pike's Peak. The butterflies, on the\r\nother hand, have small bodies and large wings, and so have the meadows\r\nof the higher Alps all to themselves. That the flowers here look so\r\nbrilliant is partly due to the thinness and clearness of the air and\r\npartly to the disposition of the butterflies. A bee is all business,\r\nbecause she has so many mouths to feed at home, and is laying up honey\r\nfor the days of the long winter. Mr. and Mrs. Butterfly, on the other\r\nhand, are gay and carefree society people.\r\n\r\n\"We have no family waiting to be fed, so why worry?\" This is the\r\nbutterfly philosophy. Only a sip of nectar now and then for their\r\npersonal wants; for the rest of the day the merry air dance, here,\r\nthere, everywhere! They flit long distances without lighting. To\r\nattract the bee's attention a blossom need be neither large nor bright,\r\nas the bee goes straight from flower to flower, wasting no time in\r\naimless flights. But to catch the eye of the butterfly the flowers\r\nmust be brilliantly colored and grow in large masses. So up in the\r\nbutterfly zone only brilliant flowers, and those having the habit of\r\ngrowing in groups produce seed and have descendants. Those that dress\r\nplainly and are not fond of company die out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE SOLDANELLA SISTERS GOT TO THE MAY-PARTY THROUGH\r\nTHE SNOW]\r\n\r\nNow didn't it turn out just as I said; that the butterflies themselves\r\nhelp brighten the flowers that grow among these ice fields? I have\r\nsomething else quite as curious to tell you: _Both the Alpine\r\nbutterflies and the flowers were left over from the Ice Age._ Not in\r\nthe same sense that we pebbles were, for we are the identical little\r\npassengers who rode in on the ice trains, and the life of a butterfly,\r\nas every one knows, is very short. So is that of a flower. Yet suppose\r\nyou found that the only other butterflies and flowers like these are\r\nfound, not among the flowers and butterflies in the lands lower down\r\nin the Alps but up toward the Arctic Zone, in Finland and Lapland; in\r\nthe snow regions of mountains in the temperate zone all over the world?\r\nIt would look very much as if these flowers and butterflies, or their\r\nancestors, had been left behind there some time or other, wouldn't it?\r\nThis is what the men of science think, and they reason about it in this\r\nway:\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE BUTTERFLIES MISSED THE TRAIN\r\n\r\nAs the glaciers spread downward from the Far North in the Ice Age they\r\nbrought all their home things with them--climate, plants, insects,\r\nanimals. Plant and animal life was driven step by step before the\r\nadvancing ice. Then, as the ice melted, flowers, butterflies, and all\r\nfollowed their natural climate back. But those that lingered too long\r\nin the meadows around the mountain tops could not cross the hot summer\r\nplains that now lay between them and the retiring ice sheet; for plants\r\nand animals that are used to cold can't stand the heat any more than\r\nthose from the tropics can stand the cold. So only the flowers and\r\nbutterflies remained in the temperate zone that found their natural\r\nclimate among the mountain peaks and stayed there.\r\n\r\nNear the top of Mount Washington, the highest peak in New Hampshire, is\r\na colony of the descendants of these butterfly pilgrims from the north\r\nwho never leave their high and wind swept meadows. There are no such\r\nbutterflies in the hills and plains below, but go into Labrador and you\r\nwill see plenty of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEFT-OVER PIECES OF THE ICE AGE\r\n\r\nOf course you understood all along that these aren't the very same\r\nbutterflies that came with the glaciers, yet in shady glens in high\r\nmountains, where the snow never melts, people do sometimes find masses\r\nof ice, which, there is every reason to believe, have been there since\r\nthe Ice Age. And sometimes thick veins of ice, buried hundreds of feet\r\nunder pebbles, boulders and soil, are struck in sinking wells. These\r\nare known as ice wells; huge ice water tanks that never need filling!\r\n\r\n\r\nII. A Little Visit with the Glaciers\r\n\r\nBut if the ice masses in the shady glens and under the old moraines\r\nmay be said to be pieces of the Ice Age left over, the glaciers of\r\nto-day are, in a sense, the Ice Age itself. For these glaciers do, on a\r\nsmaller scale, what Mr. Labrador and his partners in northern America,\r\nEurope, and Asia did on a large scale so many centuries ago. Suppose\r\nnow, like Agassiz, we trace a glacier to its source. It will be a long\r\njourney, all steep, some of it almost straight up, and along chasms of\r\nslippery ice with sudden storms that hide the chasms and blind your\r\neyes and take away your breath. The first part of our journey is over\r\na field of ice, gray with the dirt of weathered rock from the mountain\r\nsides. Along its borders are those sharp-edged stones neatly packed in\r\nrows, that our geography tells us are called \"lateral moraines.\" It\r\nhas another row of these stones sticking up right in the middle of its\r\nback, like the sharp-pointed vertebræ of the ceratosaurus.\r\n\r\nBy noon, as often happens in the Alps as elsewhere at this time of\r\nyear, a rain comes up and we lunch under the shelter of a tumbled heap\r\nof rocks. Watching the downpour drift across the desolate wastes we\r\nthink what jolly times like this Agassiz and his companions had in\r\ntheir little hall of science under the big stone. After lunch we start\r\nagain, and although it's stiff going, and it takes a lot of this thin\r\nair to make one good breath, we spare a little, now and then, for\r\nshouting, to hear the wonderful play of the echoes among the mountains.\r\nWe go through all kinds of weather--rain, mist, snow. Then suddenly we\r\nburst into blinding light. The sun is so dazzling on the snow, now no\r\nlonger covered with dirt and mountain débris, that we must all put on\r\nour colored glasses. In some places, among bare rocks that absorb the\r\nsun's heat, it is positively sultry.\r\n\r\nThe fields around us look like an ocean turned to stone. Waves are\r\nformed in the surface ice of the glacier because surface ice moves\r\nfaster than the main mass beneath. On the bordering mountain walls the\r\nice rises into still greater waves \"foaming about the feet of the dark\r\ncentral crests like the surf of enormous breakers.\" And this great,\r\nstill image of the parent sea, from which the air currents carried the\r\nmoisture that made it, has eddies and whirlpools, and like the troubled\r\nsea, \"whose waters cast up mire and dirt,\" the glacier, where it swirls\r\nalong its shores, works pebbles and dirt to the surface. Often this\r\nmaterial is carried into the centre of a whirl, as sea weeds and the\r\nrubbish of the seashore are driven into eddies among the rocks.\r\n\r\nSomebody must have been here just ahead of us. Isn't that a dark glove\r\nover there? We come closer. What at a distance seems to be a glove\r\nproves to be a hole in the ice so deep it looks dark. Lying flat and\r\ncarefully peering over the edge we look into something strangely\r\nbeautiful--an ice palace, with icicles in fantastic groups hanging\r\nfrom the roof. Through this roof the sun comes in delicate floods of\r\npale green light, the combination of the yellow rays with the blue of\r\nthe ice. We drop pebbles into the hole. They rattle down and down with\r\nlong, dull echoes, dying away. We can hear the murmur of running water.\r\nGusts of cold air come up that bite like the wind on a sharp winter day.\r\n\r\nThese underground palaces of art start as great cracks in the ice,\r\ncalled \"crevasses,\" from a French word meaning a crevice. They can\r\nusually be seen plainly as yawning chasms, but sometimes are so bridged\r\nover by the snows that a small, dark hole is all you see. And we might\r\nnot see that in time. This would be very bad, for these snow bridges\r\nare often quite thin. One might like to go down in a crevasse and\r\nexplore about in this beautiful dream world--but not when one wasn't\r\nlooking!\r\n\r\nEven when one _is_ looking and is as careful as can be it's dangerous.\r\nBut still you may be sure that the famous men who have studied glaciers\r\nhave done it, for every true man of science likes to get at the bottom\r\nof things. It was Agassiz who first went down in this way into the\r\nheart of a glacier. It was while he was making his studies in the Alps,\r\nand he came very near being drowned in one of the streams that always\r\nflow at the bottom of a crevasse, for these crevasses, breaking up the\r\nice, increase the rate of melting. (You know broken ice will not keep\r\nso well as a big block.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT TWO BOYS SAW IN THE FAIRYLAND OF ICE\r\n\r\n  When you have read John Muir's story of how he climbed down into\r\n  a crevasse in California in his shirt-sleeves (see H. & S.) you\r\n  will know that he was the other of the \"two boys\" I refer to, one\r\n  of them being Louis Agassiz, whose adventure in this fairy iceland\r\n  down in the glaciers is told in this chapter. Don't look dangerous\r\n  at a distance, do they, those crevasses? Remind one of the crimps\r\n  in a Christmas pie. But notice the difference when you get up close\r\n  to one of them in the next picture.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT THESE SCIENTISTS WILL BE BOYS\r\n\r\nAgassiz had been lowered by a rope. When his feet suddenly plunged into\r\nthe icy stream his shout for help was misunderstood by his friends and\r\nhe was lowered still further. His second cry, which you may be sure\r\npromptly followed the first, showed that something had gone wrong\r\nand he was drawn out. The worst of it was that coming up he had to\r\nsteer his course among those huge icicles, any one of which, being\r\nworn away or broken loose by the friction of the rope and striking his\r\nhead, would probably have killed him. But they are always doing things\r\nlike that--these men of science. They keep on being as curious and\r\nenthusiastic about the things they are interested in as any boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOSE LITTLE CURVED LINES WHEN YOU GET UP CLOSE\r\n\r\n  This is what those little curved lines are--really; great yawning\r\n  chasms in the ice. The sun is shining from the left; a morning\r\n  sun, probably, as those tourists are out for a walk. This scene\r\n  must be pretty well down the glacier's course, far from the upper\r\n  fields, for you see these people are just in ordinary dress--not in\r\n  the dress of mountain-climbers, with ropes and Alpine stocks and\r\n  everything.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly safe to climb glaciers as we are doing--in a book--but\r\nthey are really ticklish things to go about on, as well as down into.\r\nTo find out all the interesting things you can so easily get through\r\npictures and the printed page took years of skillful study, ingenuity,\r\nand endless patience and much courage. What a little further on in\r\nthis chapter you will learn about the movements of glaciers in seven\r\nminutes, it took Agassiz seven long years to find out and make sure of.\r\nTo Agassiz more than to any other one man the world owes the tremendous\r\nidea of the Ice Age and its story. His home among the glaciers of these\r\nAlps--named playfully by the devoted scholars who worked with him the\r\n\"Hôtel des Neuchatelois\"--was a rude shelter under a projecting rock.\r\nThe results of this long study he published in a work in two volumes,\r\nand so made known the great facts he had found and the theory about an\r\nIce Age which he based upon them and which is now everywhere accepted.\r\nHe became professor of geology at Harvard University and as famous a\r\nteacher as he was a student of nature. After his great and useful life\r\nwas ended he was buried in his adopted land with a boulder from the\r\nsite of the little stone hut on the glacier for his monument.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Soul of the Glacier\r\n\r\nMany of the fellow-countrymen of Agassiz, the peasants of the Swiss\r\nAlps, believe the glacier is a living thing and has a soul. In the\r\nspring the peasants take their sheep and cattle into the high meadows\r\ncalled \"alps,\" from which the mountains get their name, and remain\r\nthere until fall with the glaciers all around them. There are nearly\r\n2,000 glaciers in the Alps, varying from less than a mile to over ten\r\nmiles in length, and from a few hundred feet to a mile in breadth. So\r\nthe peasants have every opportunity to get acquainted with their big\r\nwhite neighbors.\r\n\r\n\"The glacier has a soul,\" they say, \"and a voice, many voices.\r\nSometimes he groans. This is when he is in pain. Listen!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUNDS THAT GIVE ONE THE \"CREEPS\"\r\n\r\nWe do hear a sound very like a groan. Even experienced mountain\r\nclimbers can hardly keep down a \"creepy\" feeling when they hear it.\r\nThis sound is made when the ice is cracking into a crevasse and while\r\nit is enlarging. These crevasses are formed by various strains in\r\nthe ice as it moves along. So long as the strain which caused them\r\ncontinues the crevasses keep widening. The \"groans\" may be said to be\r\n\"growing pains.\"\r\n\r\nIn some places you hear a constant roaring sound. The peasants are not\r\nsuperstitious about this sound however. They know it is made by what\r\nthey call the \"moulins\" or mills of the glacier. Water, melting on the\r\nsurface, makes streams. These, running together, make a larger stream.\r\nThis stream, coming to a crack in the ice where a crevasse is just\r\nbeginning, pours down, hollows out a little shaft and joins streams in\r\nthe interior of the glacier, like that in which Agassiz took a bath\r\nwhen he didn't want to. The noise of the water, striking far below,\r\ncomes up through the shaft, as a voice comes up through a speaking\r\ntube. But the crack into which the water falls must be very narrow, so\r\nthat the water can melt both walls and thus form a shaft; otherwise it\r\nmerely glides down the nearer wall and makes no sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOISES WE PEBBLES HELP MAKE\r\n\r\nWhere two ice rivers emptying into a main stream come together you\r\nhear a constant dull rattle and rumble. This is made by the blocks of\r\nstone and trains of pebbles that have ridden in on the backs of the two\r\nglaciers thus going into partnership, falling between the glaciers at\r\nthe point where they come together. The stones that do not fall over\r\nare brought together in the centre of the glacier and so make that\r\nspiny backbone of his, the \"medial moraine.\" The rows of stones on the\r\ntwo sides of the glacier, called the \"lateral moraines,\" have fallen\r\npiece by piece from the mountain walls as the glacier moved along\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nBut the strangest thing about the voices of the glaciers I have yet to\r\ntell. Whenever the sun is shining brightly, as I have said, and the\r\ngentians and the globe flowers open their petals and the birds start\r\nthe chorus of the day, the glacier begins singing, too, humming to\r\nitself a pleasant tune. When the sky grows cloudy, even for a short\r\ntime, the birds stop singing, the flowers cover their faces, the bees\r\nand butterflies hurry to shelter, and the glacier's song gradually dies\r\naway. Any cloud may bring rain, as far as the flowers and the bees and\r\nthe butterflies know, and, for the same reason, the winged people hurry\r\nto cover because they don't want to get their wings wet. The flowers\r\nhide their faces to keep the rain from washing their pollen away, and\r\nthe birds stop singing because, like the rest of us, they don't feel so\r\ncheerful under gloomy skies. But the glacier, why does he stop singing\r\ntoo? Because that murmuring tinkle you heard was made by the water\r\nmelting on the glacier and running into rivulets a little way under its\r\nsurface. When the sun stops shining the surface ice stops melting, the\r\nwater gradually quits running and the murmur of the song dies away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE ROOF OF THE ANDES, WHERE IT'S TOO COLD TO GROW\r\nGLACIERS]\r\n\r\nIt is because of these queer human habits of the glacier and, above\r\nall, his sensitive response to the moods of days and seasons, that\r\nmany of the mountain people insist he is not only a living creature,\r\nbut that he has a soul. We think of all this now as the western sun\r\ndrops behind the snowy summits, the glacier's song grows silent, and\r\nwe hear, mingling with the vespers of the birds, voices echoing from\r\ncrag to crag the words of the psalm, \"Praise ye the Lord.\" These are\r\nthe voices, of the herdsmen speaking to each other from alp to alp--the\r\nevening call to prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. How the Snow Men, the Glaciers, and the Rocks Go Walking\r\n\r\nNow that we have learned how glaciers, wild flowers, and butterflies\r\nget up into this high world, by climbing up here ourselves in the\r\nbeautiful springtime, the next thing, I suppose, is to climb down\r\nagain. But first just look over the edge here and you can get some\r\nnotion of how high we are, not merely in feet and figures, as we have\r\nit in the table of mountain heights in our geography, but in _actual\r\nfeeling_.\r\n\r\n\"What are those little blocks, all ruled off like a chessboard, away\r\ndown there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are the little Swiss farms with the gray roads between.\"\r\n\r\n\"And those small white things among the farms that look like pieces of\r\ngrit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are the Swiss villages.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the black specks on the slopes of the mountain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are tourists with their guides, coming up. People, no doubt,\r\nwhom we should like to know, but we shall have an interesting new\r\nacquaintance travelling down with us. You've met some of his family, no\r\ndoubt, for he's an ice man. There are several of these ice men always\r\ntravelling down on the glaciers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD MAN OF BALISTAN\r\n\r\n  Where would you say, judging from the head-dress of the man in the\r\n  middle, this scene is located? Somewhere in Asia, wouldn't you? For\r\n  in Asia the natives, particularly the Mahometans, wear turbans, as\r\n  you would learn by simply looking up \"turban\" in a dictionary. And\r\n  wouldn't those summer helmets lead you to suppose that this is a\r\n  hot climate, in spite of the great ice-pillar and the snow-field?\r\n  And don't those helmets suggest Englishmen? Now, where in Asia\r\n  would you find vast mountains, a hot climate, Mahometans, and\r\n  Englishmen together? Yes, to be sure, in the Himalayas of India.\r\n  And that's just where an expedition of English scientists came\r\n  across this grotesque creature of stone and ice one summer day,\r\n  on a glacier in Balistan. So I just called him \"The Old Man of\r\n  Balistan.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nYou'll know one of them the moment you see him, for they are\r\nqueer-looking fellows with only one leg--or rather one leg at a\r\ntime--and they wear big stone hats. They never go walking without them.\r\nThey can't.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOKS LIKE A BROTHER, BUT HE'S NO RELATION\r\n\r\n  This \"old man\" is a creature, not of the snows but of the winds.\r\n  The capstone--apparently conglomerate, it looks so rough and\r\n  pebbly--tumbled down from the mountains once upon a time and found\r\n  a resting place on a bed of softer rock, a section of which became\r\n  separated from the mass on either side by those earth cracks called\r\n  \"joints.\" Then the winds and other instruments of weathering got\r\n  their fingers in these cracks, wore the neighboring sections away,\r\n  and left this pillar standing. It is broader at the bottom because\r\n  the winds, checked by the obstacles on the ground, didn't strike\r\n  with such force as they did higher up.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo the group of boys and girls to whom I first told these stories of\r\nmy life and adventures nothing was more interesting than this account\r\nof the ice men who walk. On that occasion I called them snow men\r\nbecause the boys had just been making a snow man, and these ice men up\r\nhere, like the glaciers on which they always travel, are made of snow\r\nturned to ice. You have heard the expression \"clothes make the man,\"\r\nbut in the case of these men of the snows it is literally true, so far\r\nas their hats are concerned, for it is their hats that make them grow.\r\n\r\n\"I bite,\" said the High School Boy, \"what's the answer?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAN YOU SOLVE THIS PICTURE PUZZLE?]\r\n\r\nFor reply I roughly sketched the picture at the top of the page. From\r\nthis hint my audience thought out the answer for themselves. See if you\r\ncan do so before you learn, in the next few paragraphs, what the answer\r\nis.\r\n\r\nIt comes about like this. One day we see a big stone lying on the\r\nglacier, and when we come that way again several days later this same\r\nstone is standing on a tall pillar of ice. We notice the stone hat is\r\ntilted forward a little, apparently to shade this queer man's face,\r\nwhich is always turned directly toward the sun. It sits jauntily on one\r\nside--this hat of his--as if he were feeling particularly contented\r\nwith himself and the world on this sunny day and had started for a\r\nstroll.\r\n\r\nAnd it really is because the sun is so bright that the hat is tipped.\r\nMoreover it is because of the sunshine that the man takes a stroll. If,\r\nafter more days of sunshine, we return we see the same stone further\r\ndown the slope of the glacier and apparently standing on the same leg.\r\n\r\n\"But does he or it actually walk on that leg?\"\r\n\r\n(The audience, who at first thought I was joking, had begun to believe\r\nI was in earnest.)\r\n\r\nYes, that leg and others. Before this Alpine tourist ends his travels\r\ndown to the valleys below he may have, all told, as many legs as a\r\ncentipede, but only one at a time. Like the legs of the amœba and the\r\nclaws of the crab they are renewed as wanted. A big stone falling from\r\nthe mountain side upon a glacier protects the ice beneath from the\r\nsun's rays, so, as the ice melts down around it, the stone is left\r\nstanding on a pillar. These \"glacier tables\" (to use the scientific\r\nterm) are formed on the south sides of glaciers where there is the most\r\nsun. Owing to the slant of the rays the rock is heated most on the\r\nsouth end and so tips in that direction more and more. Finally it falls\r\noff and, in so doing, pitches farther down the slope. Then a new pillar\r\nis formed and the whole process is gone through again.\r\n\r\n(If we should get lost up here any one of these snow men will tell us\r\nthe way out. The snow man's hat, for the reason stated, always tips\r\ntoward the south.)\r\n\r\nThe stones of the winter lands are not only like human beings in the\r\nfact that they walk, but like _little_ human beings in the fact that\r\nwhen they are small they can't. In one of the pictures I drew for the\r\nboys and girls--that representing the ice pillar from which the stone\r\nhas slipped--you may be able to make out a little pebble. It got a\r\nride because it was hiding under the big stone. Left to itself \"it\r\nwouldn't have a leg to stand on,\" as the saying goes, for small stones\r\nare heated through by the sun and so sink down into the ice and form no\r\n\"legs.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From a photograph copyrighted by Merl La Voy_\r\n\r\n                       THE RUSH OF THE AVALANCHE\r\n\r\n  It's seldom you can get a snap-shot at an avalanche--it's so\r\n  sudden! Then, when you do get one you must be an expert or your\r\n  picture will be a blur. This picture was taken by Merl La Voy. An\r\n  interesting thing about it is that the scene is on Mount McKinley,\r\n  which, as your geography will tell you, is the highest mountain\r\n  in North America. The avalanche started near the top, where the\r\n  greatest fields of loose snow lie. We see it in the act of plunging\r\n  into a vast crevasse several miles below, and sending up clouds of\r\n  snow. They look like steam.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GLACIER'S CATERPILLAR TRACTOR\r\n\r\n\"The glaciers,\" says Reclus, \"seem as motionless as the peaks that\r\ntower above them.\" Nevertheless, as we know, they do move. While the\r\nmotion is in so many respects like that of a river that glaciers are\r\noften called \"ice rivers,\" they have motions and, so to say, \"methods\"\r\nthat curiously suggest the inventions of men. Take, for example, the\r\nway they climb down a steep hill; for all the world like the \"tanks\" in\r\nthe Great War. The tanks, you remember, made nothing of shell holes,\r\nrough country, ravines, or trenches, but lumbered and crushed their\r\nway along, resistless as the Fates. And, you may also recall, the\r\ntanks moved by laying sections of themselves--the great cleats on the\r\noutside belt--which they picked up again, as they advanced. This was\r\ncalled the \"caterpillar tractor\" system of travelling.\r\n\r\nNow watch the glacier when it comes to an incline much steeper than its\r\nordinary slope. It breaks across in sections at right angles to its\r\nbed, and section after section drops down. Then the forward sections\r\ncrowded upon by those in the rear are pushed up close, freeze together\r\nagain, and on goes the glacier as good as new.\r\n\r\nAs a traveller, however, it is a little slow. It made faster time in\r\nthe old days--in the Ice Age--when glaciers were so much larger, but\r\nto-day, at the rate at which ordinary glaciers travel, it may take a\r\nboulder as big as Plymouth Rock something like a hundred years to be\r\ncarried from the upper fields to the heap of stones and soil which your\r\ngeography calls a \"terminal moraine,\" and where Mr. Glacier says:\r\n\r\n\"All out! Far as we go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  How would you like to go to school to the pretty Misses Soldanella?\r\n  They can teach you a lot about botany. If you learn what an unusual\r\n  thing they do with their leaves, for instance, that will lead\r\n  you to follow up leaves in general. Leaves are wonderful things.\r\n  Indeed, it isn't often you find the leaf of a book that will tell\r\n  you half as much as the leaf of a plant, if you only know how to\r\n  read it.\r\n\r\n  In Grant Allen's \"Flash Lights on Nature,\" you will find that the\r\n  Soldanella sisters store food in their leaves all winter just as we\r\n  put things away in the cellar, and how this helps them get up so\r\n  early in the spring; why the fact that the little sisters are not\r\n  very tall makes them hurry so; and why if they _didn't_ hurry they\r\n  wouldn't get to the party at all!\r\n\r\n  What other members of the primrose family do you know?\r\n\r\n  See what you can find about our earliest flowers--hepatica,\r\n  bloodroot, dog-toothed violet, jack-in-the-pulpit, Dutchman's\r\n  breeches, anemones.\r\n\r\n  If you will examine closely many early spring buds and\r\n  flowers--especially those like the willow and hazel catkins--you\r\n  will find that they too keep warm and grow in the early spring, not\r\n  from the warmth of the sun alone but from the fuel they have laid\r\n  up in their buds.\r\n\r\n  Did you know that to see the very first flowers of all in the\r\n  spring you must look up--away above your head? (_Maple._)\r\n\r\n  Any good book on Alaska will tell a number of striking things about\r\n  how rapidly spring comes on in the lands where glaciers grow.\r\n\r\n  Get Muir's \"Mountains of California\" and hear him tell about how he\r\n  went down into a crevasse in his shirt-sleeves, and of the fairy\r\n  underworld he found there, and how he hated to come away.\r\n\r\n  Reclus[11] tells how the glaciers not only come down to call on the\r\n  farmers, sometimes, but even help them pick cherries!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: \"The Earth.\"]\r\n\r\n  I suppose the children who go to the excellent Swiss schools take\r\n  delight in telling grandmother that Mr. Glacier isn't really a\r\n  person--as he is in the tales of the winter fireside--but wouldn't\r\n  both grandmother and the children open their eyes if they knew that\r\n  in Greenland there is a glacier so big it feeds itself and makes\r\n  its own snow and its own storms and everything? Hobb's \"The Face of\r\n  the Earth\" tells all about it.\r\n\r\n  And the Encyclopædia Britannica and Hobbs together will tell you\r\n  how to make a good glacier. There are a half-dozen things you must\r\n  remember or your glacier won't turn out right. (1) You must take\r\n  plenty of snow; (2) and keep it in a cool place; (3) but you must\r\n  warm it a little too, once in a while; (4) your mountain gorges\r\n  must not be too steep; (5) you must have your mountains set just\r\n  so; (6) and distribute your storms with care. By doing all these\r\n  things you get fine, durable glaciers, 100 to 200 feet thick,\r\n  sometimes 500 and even 1,000 feet thick. But you must be careful,\r\n  and, of course, it takes time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                                (APRIL)\r\n\r\n    Now the noisy winds are still;\r\n    April's coming up the hill!\r\n    All the spring is in her train,\r\n    Led by shining ranks of rain.\r\n\r\n                                                  --_Mary Mapes Dodge._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APRIL RAINS AND THE WORK OF THE RIVERS\r\n\r\nI always liked the little boy's definition of a river system. \"Rivers\r\nthat empty into other rivers that empty into other rivers that empty\r\ninto the sea.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is still more interesting, the sea at the same time is emptying\r\ninto the rivers; for the waters of all the lands and the waters of all\r\nthe seas, are one, and what the rivers give to the sea the sea returns\r\nin the rain clouds that are blown landward by the winds. The Earth's\r\nwaters are thus always in circulation like the blood in our bodies. In\r\nmaking this endless circuit they do an immense amount of useful and\r\nbeautiful work, and have many strange and curious ways of doing it.\r\nIt's a great family affair of the Waters people. Everybody has a hand\r\nin it, from the baby rill that toddles across the country road, the\r\nbrook it meets in the meadow, the creek that runs through the wood,\r\nand the river into which it flows, to the greater river which carries\r\nforward these mingled waters to the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER SYSTEM]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. What I Brought Back from the Creek\r\n\r\nI met a rain-drop once that had followed the thing through, starting\r\nwhere a little creek began, and got such a load of information I could\r\nhardly carry it, about the wonderful part the rivers take and have\r\ntaken in the making and remaking of the world.\r\n\r\nWe see the April rains carve fairy canyons in the soft clay of the\r\nroadside or the creek, but it is hard to realize, as we stand on some\r\npinnacle of the Alps and look out over the deep and wide valleys, the\r\ngorges, the cliffs, and mountains cut in two, that all are but the\r\nhandiwork of the rain-drops banded together as flowing waters. For\r\na long time this was questioned by scientific men, because the idea\r\nso upset the old theory that great changes in this world of ours came\r\nabout all of a sudden and from causes not at work in these days. Now,\r\nhowever, nobody doubts that the big things are done by the little\r\npeople, working together over long periods of time; little snowflakes,\r\nlittle rain-drops, little cells in plants. As a result, the Alps, so\r\nfar as the expression of their faces is concerned, are as little like\r\nthe Alps of the past as the face of the old farm of to-day is like the\r\nfarm of those ancient yesterdays, when the brontosaurus browsed where\r\nold Dobbin is nipping the meadow grass and the mammoth ate the leaves\r\nof trees that stood where White Face is thoughtfully chewing her cud in\r\nthe shade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THEY STUDY GEOGRAPHY IN BOSTON\r\n\r\n  This is what, in the Boston schools, they call an \"umbrella party.\"\r\n  \"Umbrella party\" sounds much more attractive than \"geography\r\n  lesson,\" but as a matter of fact it is a geography lesson and a\r\n  fine one. As soon as they get off that brick pavement the boys and\r\n  girls will see those rain-drops cutting out little Mississippi\r\n  River systems, filling little Great Lakes, plunging over Niagaras\r\n  two inches high!\r\n]\r\n\r\nRight where you sit reading, perhaps, the land used to be buried two\r\nmiles deep beneath rocks which have been worn away by wind and rain and\r\nby rivers which vanished long ago. Everything has been so changed that\r\nif the old scenery should be put back you would be lost right on the\r\nhome farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE YOU CAN JUMP ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI\r\n\r\nWrinkles in the earth and in the mountainsides make the first troughs\r\nfor the streamlets and the rivers, and then the running water itself\r\ndigs these natural channels deeper. Many rivers begin as streamlets\r\nflowing out of springs. The great Mississippi began as a baby, just\r\nlike the rest of us. You can jump across it still if you go up to\r\nits source. Springs not only start rivers in life but go on feeding\r\nthem. Most large river systems get secret gifts in this way, as they\r\nflow along, from thousands of springs that empty into them or their\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\nSo springs start and feed the rivers. Now what do you suppose starts\r\nthe springs? Rain-drops stored away in big stone \"safes,\" much as a\r\nsmall boy stores away pennies in his tin bank! The water of rains and\r\nmelting snows, passing down through the soil, soaks into the little\r\nchambers or pores in such rocks as sandstone and limestone, and keeps\r\ngoing on down until it comes to a bed of hard stone, such as slate or\r\ngranite, into which it cannot soak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPRING WHEN EMPTY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPRING WHEN FULL]\r\n\r\n                  THIS SPRING PLAYS IT'S A TOWN PUMP\r\n\r\n  These two pictures show an intermittent spring about five miles\r\n  from Singer Glenn, Virginia, and there called the \"Tide Spring.\"\r\n  You can see where the idea of the tide comes in, but can you think\r\n  why the spring seems to have a tide system all its own? You know\r\n  what a siphon is. Well, think how a kind of siphon might be formed\r\n  in rock, dissolved out by water flowing underground. Then look at\r\n  the picture on the next page.\r\n\r\nNow rock-beds, as you know, have a slope--some more, some less--owing\r\nto the wrinkling of the earth's crust. So the water, slowly trickling\r\nthrough the porous rock, forms a steady stream which runs down along\r\nthe hard rock, as rain runs down a roof, and finally gushes out at some\r\nlower level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE LITTLE SPRING WORKS ITS PUMP\r\n\r\n  This is how the pump of an intermittent spring is worked. Some\r\n  portions of rock are dissolved by underground waters more readily\r\n  than others and so cavities are sometimes formed, as shown. As\r\n  long as the water in the reservoir is below the arch of the\r\n  siphon-shaped outlet no water escapes, but as soon as it rises to\r\n  the level of the arch the whole of the water is drawn off. Then\r\n  the spring ceases to flow until the reservoir fills up again. You\r\n  can empty water in the same way by using a bent tube of any kind.\r\n  Can you tell why the water flows up-hill in this way? Remember\r\n  what you know about air-pressure and then look up \"siphon\" in your\r\n  encyclopædia.\r\n]\r\n\r\nYou can be sure these companies of rain-drops, hurrying back to the\r\nlight, don't fail to notice any cracks in the rocks along the way, and\r\nat such places they come gushing up with sparkle and dance; and the\r\ngreater the dip of the rock beds the higher they dance, of course.\r\n\r\nBut it takes any one rain-drop so long to get back into the sunshine\r\nafter it starts on its underground journey that you'd think it would\r\nforget how to dance at all! It isn't just the same rain-drop, to be\r\nsure, that goes into the ground and comes out again, because the\r\nrain-drops get all mixed up with each other as they move along, but\r\njust imagine some one rain-drop that fell, say, on a hilltop on the day\r\na baby was born in a valley five miles away, where there was a spring\r\nin a shady hollow near the baby's home. By the time that rain-drop got\r\ndown to the spring the baby would be old enough to vote!\r\n\r\nYet this is a very good thing for the rivers and the rest of us--this\r\nslow travel of the underground water, whether it comes out in springs\r\nor simply seeps through the soil as most of that which supplies the\r\nrivers does. Otherwise, if all the water of the rains went directly\r\ninto the rivers we would have floods after every wet spell and empty\r\nriver beds between times.\r\n\r\nHere's another river rebus. How do rivers grow longer at the top? All\r\nrivers grow at their source because their headwaters eat back into the\r\nrocks and the soil, just as the rain wears away the head of any gully.\r\nWhere the rock is soft they eat back faster. The Mohawk River in New\r\nYork State probably wouldn't have amounted to anything if it hadn't\r\ndone this very thing. From Albany westward past Utica runs a belt of\r\nshale, a weak stone, but here so soft that the surface of it crumbles\r\nback to clay in every winter's frost. Into this the Mohawk, which in\r\npast ages was only a little stream, has eaten back its way until now it\r\nis over a hundred miles long.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes rivers are so big the very first day they come into the\r\nworld that you may say they are born half grown. You find them, among\r\nother places, in the mountains of California. Nearly all the water\r\nfrom the melting snows on Mount Shasta sinks at once into the porous\r\nlava fields of the mountain slopes, and after wandering about in the\r\nhidden veins comes out, filtered and cool, in the form of large springs\r\nwhich make rivers that set out on their life journeys without ever\r\nhaving been babies at all so far as you can see. The Shasta River is\r\none of these. The McCloud is another. It gushes forth suddenly from a\r\nlava bluff in a roaring spring seventy-five yards across, two-thirds of\r\nthe width of the river in its widest part. The River Jordan in the Holy\r\nLand begins in one of these great springs at the foot of Mount Hermon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From Norton's \"Elements of Geology.\" By permission of Ginn and\r\n  Company_\r\n\r\n              HOW MOST OF EUROPE'S RIVERS GET THEIR START\r\n\r\n  Most of the important rivers of Europe start as streams of\r\n  ice-water, flowing out of glaciers. Notice the boulders along the\r\n  side of the stream. They also came out of the body of the glacier,\r\n  where, as we shall see when we take up \"The Stones of the Field\"\r\n  in Chapter VII, the boulders that rode south with the glaciers got\r\n  most of their roundness.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe know already what a hand the glaciers had in the Ice Age in shaping\r\nthe course and conduct of rivers, and you may be sure they have\r\nsomething to do with the making of rivers to-day. The under side of a\r\nglacier gets warmed from three sources: (1) its own pressure; (2) the\r\nfriction as it moves; and (3) the heat from the inside of the earth\r\nwhich, on account of this thick ice blanket, can't get away into the\r\nair as it does elsewhere. This heat melts the ice and, as we know,\r\nthere is water melting also on the surface of glaciers and in the\r\ncrevasses. Beside all this the water of rains falls upon the glacier\r\nso that there is plenty of water to make rivers, and we always find\r\nstreams of water running from a glacier's front. Most of the rivers of\r\nCentral Europe start in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEAUTY OF THE BRIDAL VEIL\r\n\r\nAnd, although they didn't make the rivers themselves, the Ice Age\r\nGlaciers are held responsible for the fact that many little rivers\r\nalways have to jump to catch the train. That is to say, they come\r\ntumbling over falls to join the larger streams into which they empty.\r\nThe reason of this is that when, in the Ice Age, the glaciers filled\r\nthe river valleys the larger glaciers in a main valley dug below the\r\ntributary valleys and so left the mouths of the tributary rivers high\r\nup on the main valley's walls. The famous \"Bridal Veil\" in the Yosemite\r\nis one of these side valley falls. The fall--900 feet--is so great\r\nthat the water widens to a fleecy foam and waves back and forth in the\r\nwind like a gauzy veil and, instead of a roar like Niagara, it makes a\r\nrustling sound like silk.\r\n\r\nWhile some rivers come hurrying down like that--as if they really were\r\nafraid the larger river would go off and leave them--others, like the\r\nAmazon, roll on as stately as a Lord Mayor's procession. But the\r\nwaters of all are on their way to the sea. The rock layers, owing to\r\nthe wrinkling of the earth as it shrinks, are nowhere level, so flowing\r\nwater is always on a down grade, sloping toward the sea or toward other\r\nland that does slope toward the sea. Then remember too as the sea\r\nbottom keeps sinking the continents keep rising, which increases the\r\npitch of the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUMPING TO CATCH THE TRAIN\r\n\r\n  See the famous Bridal Veil Falls in the Yosemite Valley hurrying\r\n  down to reach the river below. As the stream descends, it broadens\r\n  into a beautiful, filmy veil.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAll very simple, but none the less grand and impressive. Ruskin, in one\r\nof the noblest of his passages, says:\r\n\r\n\"[All water courses], from the inch-deep streamlet that crosses the\r\nvillage land in trembling clearness to the massy and silent march of\r\nthe Amazon and the Ganges, owe their play and power to the ordained\r\nelevations of the earth; [to] paths prepared for them by which at\r\nsome appointed rate of journey they must evermore descend, sometimes\r\nslow and sometimes swift, but never pausing, the gateways of guarding\r\nmountains opened for them in cleft and chasm, and from afar off the\r\ngreat heart of the sea calling them to itself.\"\r\n\r\nThat's a poetic way of putting it, but it's a fact nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Human Nature in Rivers\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of human nature in rivers. To begin with, as we might\r\nsuppose, they do the most playing and the least work when they are\r\nyoung. Brooks will be brooks, you know!\r\n\r\nWhat pretty ways they have in babyhood! Kissing the pebbles, crooning,\r\nbubbling, chattering, playing, they are big Mississippis or great\r\noceans that, like Homer's ocean river, flow around the world. Their\r\nbubbles are ships, sometimes wrecked on dreadful headlands along the\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANT OF THE WATERFALLS\r\n\r\nWaterfalls are found only in young streams and more often as you near\r\nthe source. Older streams have worn down their beds more nearly to\r\na level and, as we all know, more rivers begin among the mountains\r\nand highlands than in the lower lands. In the mountain regions there\r\nare plenty of rocks and cliffs to jump from, and the rivers, you may\r\nbe sure, make the most of their opportunities. At such falls as the\r\nBridal Veil they jump so far they are turned into white cascades, and\r\nas you climb the cliff beside them and feel the wind wafting spray in\r\nyour face you hear the music of their songs. The more or less regular\r\ndash of the water as it swings back and forth in the wind gives that\r\nchanting sound described in waterfall poetry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"BROOKS WILL BE BROOKS, YOU KNOW!\"\r\n\r\n  Our baby river of the meadow seems to be playing it has a Niagara\r\n  Falls of its own, \"Rock of Ages\" and all! See the \"huge mass\" of\r\n  rock at the foot of the falls; and the rapids?\r\n]\r\n\r\nLike children these dancing, singing rivers love pictures and color.\r\nYou see that in the rainbow tints of the spray as the sunlight strikes\r\nthe air bubbles the waterfall \"blows\"; in the green of its waters\r\nturned to gray in the foam; in the reflections of mountain, sky, and\r\ncloud in the smooth stretches below the falls.\r\n\r\nAnd, like pebbles and other little people, rivers love to play in the\r\nrain. My! What a time! In a storm, with a gray flood pouring from the\r\nsky, you hear, mingled with the voice of wind and rain, the swash and\r\ngurgle of the eddies as the river goes along in its dance, wild with\r\nthe joy of it all. In a mountain stream during a heavy rain, with wind,\r\nyou can also hear the waves dashing against the rocks along the shore\r\nor in the stream, and the smothered, bumping, rumbling made by the\r\nboulders on the bottom knocking against each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORM CHORUS OF THE MOUNTAIN TORRENTS\r\n\r\nFrom any high place during a mountain storm you can see twenty, yes,\r\noften a hundred torrents, and the noise of the water and the moving\r\nstones makes a wonderful storm chorus. Reclus compares the sound made\r\nby the stones to dull thunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE TO LOOK FOR HIDING RIVERS\r\n\r\nRivers, both young and old, play hide and seek. Possibly the older\r\nrivers get to dreaming of their infancy when they were springs, and\r\nwant to play they are springs again; anyhow, they disappear in the\r\nground in one place and then come out laughing in another as if they\r\nreally _were_ springs! And how they must chuckle to themselves when\r\nthey fool people into thinking they are brand new rivers! This happens\r\nsometimes, and so the river gets a different name at the place where it\r\ncomes out from the name it bears up to the point where it disappears.\r\nSuch hide-and-seek rivers are found in regions where it doesn't often\r\nrain. The Tujunga, which you cross in going from Los Angeles to San\r\nFrancisco, is such a river. At one place in its course it comes out of\r\na canyon, looks around a minute, and then disappears in the pebbles,\r\nsand and gravel of the plain. Down it goes until it reaches a bed of\r\nhard rock. Along this underground bed it runs until it gets to a place\r\nnorth of Cahuenga Peak, where it comes up in springs and flows into the\r\nLos Angeles River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOST RIVERS AND THE THOUSAND SPRINGS\r\n\r\n  These are the waters of some hidden tributaries of the Snake\r\n  River gushing out as springs from its beautiful banks. The group\r\n  is called \"The Thousand Springs,\" and is supposed to be the\r\n  reappearance of two \"Lost Rivers\" that disappeared back in the sand\r\n  wastes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMountain lakes are where the lively little torrents stop to sleep. \"The\r\nsea,\" says Ruskin, \"seems only to pause; the mountain lake to sleep and\r\nto dream.\"\r\n\r\nBut after this sleep how they laugh and play--those baby rivers--as\r\nthey go dancing over the pebbles and down the falls; for in these lakes\r\nthey gather themselves together into a larger volume of water, and so,\r\nof course, flow on with increased energy.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as a stream is fairly over the lake lip it breaks into\r\ncascades, never for a moment halting, and scarce abating one jot of its\r\nglad energy until it reaches the next basin. Then swirling and curving\r\ndrowsily (dropping off to sleep again!) through meadow and grove it\r\nbreaks forth anew into gray rapids and falls, leaping and gliding in\r\nglorious exuberance of wild bound and dance down into another and yet\r\nanother lake basin.\"[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Muir, \"The Sierra Nevada Mountains.\"]\r\n\r\nJust as it is with human beings, a river seems to grow more thoughtful\r\nand thrifty as it grows older; and, best of all, this thought and\r\nthrift is for others--for the people of the plant world along its banks\r\nand for its old parent, the sea. With the help of pebbles it puts money\r\nin its savings bank and pays it out from time to time.\r\n\r\nIn seasons of flood it carries loads and loads of pebbles along. As the\r\nflood goes down these pebbles are dropped and covered with the sediment\r\nthat settles along its banks. Then these pebbles begin to decay and so\r\nenrich the soil. Later along comes another flood, takes the pebbles\r\nout of the bank, carries them farther along, and, as the waters go\r\ndown, puts them back in the bank again. In course of time this kind of\r\nfresh food from the decaying pebbles gets carried into the sea, where\r\nit helps to furnish food and shell material for the shell-fish and raw\r\nmaterial to be worked up by the sea's rock mills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAYS OF A WANDERING RIVER]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Machinery of the Rivers\r\n\r\nTo do all their great part in the world's work the rivers need only\r\ntime, enthusiasm, patience, machinery, and tools. All these the rivers\r\nhave, and the machinery they use and the engineering methods they\r\nfollow are much more modern than we would suppose. Take, for example,\r\nthe way in which rivers widen their banks. The current cuts with the\r\ngreatest force on the outside of bends, and the motion and effect is\r\npractically that of a circular saw. This sawing is done on the largest\r\nscale where the current meanders. Swinging from side to side it cuts\r\naway both banks.\r\n\r\nAnd what it cuts away it spreads over the valley by its back-and-forth\r\nmotion, much as men spread dirt with scrapers when they are grading a\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nThat's how crooked rivers make broad valleys. But they have to have the\r\nhelp of us pebbles, too. We're hard to get along without! Notice, the\r\nnext time the river or the creek is up, the rolling, hopping motion of\r\nthe pebbles as they are carried along by the rushing water. It is these\r\npebbles grinding on the bottom and sides of the river's bed that help\r\nmost in this kind of valley deepening and widening. In the same way we\r\npebbles helped dig those grand affairs, the gorges and the canyons in\r\nthe mountains. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado is a part of our work.\r\n\r\nIn the widening of valleys the circular saws of crooked streams are\r\nvery useful, but there are other things at work. The rains dissolve\r\nthe soil and wash the banks away and slope them down; Jack Frost, with\r\nhis wedges, pries out both soil and rock; the little farmers with many\r\nfeet--the burrowing animals and insects--and the famous farmer with no\r\nfeet at all--the angleworm--loosen soil, and so help the river to carry\r\nit away; and the ice, when the river breaks up in the spring, chisels\r\noff the banks as it passes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW RIVERS BUILD STONE BRIDGES\r\n\r\n  Natural bridges are made by the same agency that forms the\r\n  intermittent springs--the dissolving power of water--and, like the\r\n  springs, are characteristic of limestone regions because limestone\r\n  is readily dissolved in water. In the little model of a limestone\r\n  region \"a\" and \"a\" are \"sink-holes\"--saucer-shaped hollows\r\n  dissolved and washed into funnels through which the surface water\r\n  joins underground streams such as you see flowing beneath the two\r\n  \"bs,\" which are natural bridges in the making.\r\n\r\n  The lower picture shows just how one of the bridge-builders looks\r\n  while at work, dissolving and wearing down the rock. The next two\r\n  pictures will help tell you two other ways in which rivers make\r\n  their own bridges.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf you have ever been in a machine-shop you must have noticed how a\r\nplaning-mill works away on a job it has been set to do, without anybody\r\nwatching it at all; and when it gets done with its job it stops, all\r\nby itself. Such machinery is called \"automatic,\" because, to a certain\r\nextent, it runs its own affairs. A river, in planing down and reshaping\r\nvalley scenery, has an automatic stop. When it has cut its valley down\r\nto sea level it stops, because, being then no higher than the sea, it\r\ncan no longer flow toward it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER A FEW CUPS OF TEA\r\n\r\n  When winding rivers get a few cups of tea--that is, are in\r\n  flood--they rush straight ahead and, while much of the water may\r\n  for a time still go on around the bend, some of it is forced\r\n  through openings in the rock and in time carves out a bridge. How\r\n  they do this is shown in the upper diagram on page 83.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut before this automatic stop shuts off their machinery the work that\r\nrivers do is immense. The Mississippi River carries enough solid matter\r\nto the Gulf every year to make a mountain a mile square and 268 feet\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOU KNOW THIS BRIDGE, OF COURSE\r\n\r\n  The Natural Bridge of Virginia is an example of still another style\r\n  of river bridge-building. This bridge used to be part of the roof\r\n  of a cave and remained after the rest of the roof fell in.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen ordinary people want to cross a mountain they have to climb over\r\nit. But do you know what a river does? It cuts its way right through\r\nand makes what is called a water-gap--a great gate of stone that is\r\nalways open and through which the stream forever flows. All the river\r\nused was tools and time. The tools were the sand and pebbles it swept\r\nalong. So in the course of ages, running like a band saw, the Potomac\r\nmade the water-gap at Harper's Ferry, the Delaware River the Delaware\r\nWater-Gap.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MOUNTAINS HELP MAKE THE WATER GATES\r\n\r\nBut how could a river do this? It couldn't flow up one side of the\r\nmountain and down the other, could it? No, certainly not. What then?\r\nWherever you find a river cutting through a mountain range you may\r\nbe sure the river was there before the mountains rose, and that the\r\nmountains rose so slowly the river kept right on in its old channel and\r\nwore down the rock under that channel as fast as the mountains rose;\r\nwhile, on either side, they could rise as high as they wanted to for\r\nall the river cared!\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWING MOUNTAINS AND THE EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\nBut suppose, before I had explained how water-gaps are made I had told\r\nyou I could show you a mountain growing. You wouldn't have believed\r\nit. Regions in which mountains are still rising, as on our Pacific\r\nCoast, are liable to earthquakes. The reason is that as mountains rise\r\nthe rock layers of which they are made are strained dreadfully. Every\r\nonce in a while they crack and the rocks on either side of this crack\r\ngrind against each other. This makes the earth shake, much as the house\r\nshakes when a heavy table is pushed across a bare floor.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see a job of river engineering that will make you catch\r\nyour breath, look over into some of the river canyons and gorges of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT CUMBERLAND WATER-GAP\r\n\r\n  Here is the famous Cumberland Gap that the river cut through the\r\n  mountains; so cutting a great figure in United States history,\r\n  also, you remember. The picture shows the region as it looked in\r\n  early days.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA mile isn't much straight ahead, but a mile straight down and you on\r\nyour stomach, with your eyes just over the edge--it's an _awful_ long\r\nway! Imagine yourself looking down a wall of rock like that, and the\r\nbottom of the abyss so far off that it looks blue--that's a canyon!\r\n\r\n\r\nAND YET THAT LITTLE RIVER DID IT ALL!\r\n\r\nAnd now we are going down into the vastest canyon in the world, a\r\ncanyon so vast that it has already swallowed practically all the\r\nwords in the dictionary suitable to such scenery and still remains\r\nundescribed--so all the skilled writers say who have tried their hands\r\nat it. This is the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. Do you remember how\r\nin \"Alice in Wonderland\" the cat disappeared and left nothing but its\r\nsmile? Well, the first time you see the Grand Canyon you feel as if it\r\nhad swallowed you and left nothing but your eyes! And when they tell\r\nyou that it was all done by that little river that you can just make\r\nout threading its way along the bottom, you can't believe it! The total\r\nlength of the river's gorge--a canyon is just a long gorge--is some 400\r\nmiles. The part of it known as the Grand Canyon is a yawning abyss of\r\nstone into which the river walls widen for a distance of 42 miles. The\r\nLower Colorado River, that dug this chasm in the rock, flows through a\r\nvast table-land where rain seldom falls. But the river, which rises in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, has a constant supply of water from the mountain\r\nrains and the melting snow. The canyons you see branching from the main\r\ngorge in our picture were cut by the Colorado's tributaries. Working\r\ntogether on different sides, they carved out those rock masses that\r\nlook like oriental temples and have been named accordingly--the temples\r\nof Brahma, Osiris, Zoroaster, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd here in this canyon is a splendid example of how the rivers, in\r\naddition to all their other labors, write history. They helped to lay\r\ndown on the borders of the ancient sea the material out of which the\r\nrocks were made. It is in the leaves in such books of stone that the\r\ngeologist reads the great events of world-making history. Moreover, the\r\nrivers may be said to cut the leaves of the book when they dig down\r\nthrough them, as in this immense library of the Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From a photograph copyrighted by Fred Harvey_\r\n\r\n           AND WE PEBBLES HELPED DIG THE GRAND CANYON, TOO!\r\n\r\n  River water alone couldn't cut those canyons--the Grand Canyon and\r\n  the rest. The Colorado and its tributaries had to have grinding\r\n  tools and the tools were the pebbles they dragged over their\r\n  rock-beds; and thus, in the course of ages, wore them down and down\r\n  and down.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBusy, busy all the time--these rivers. But although they are always at\r\nwork they not only never forget to look beautiful but they beautify\r\neverything they touch. At the outset the lines of a river valley are\r\nrather straight and angular, as if the scenery were just being blocked\r\nout by an artist, but as the valley grows older its slopes become more\r\ngentle, the angles disappear into rounded forms, and the river itself\r\nwinds along in graceful lines, exactly reproducing what the great\r\nEnglish artist Hogarth called \"the line of beauty.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THAT MIGHTY RIVER IN THE MEADOWS\r\n\r\n    Yon stream, whose sources run,\r\n      Turned by a pebble's edge,\r\n    Is Athabasca, rolling towards the sun,\r\n      Through the cleft mountain ledge.\r\n\r\n    The slender rill had strayed,\r\n      But for the slanting stone,\r\n    To evening's ocean, with the tangled braid\r\n      Of foam-flecked Oregon.\r\n\r\n                                                     --Holmes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBack of all the work of the rivers from year to year and age to age,\r\nthere seems always the thought of beauty as well as the thought of use.\r\nThey are evidently under an eternal law of service, of beauty, and of\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n    \"The hills are shadows, and they flow\r\n     From form to form and nothing stands.\r\n     They melt like mists the solid lands;\r\n     Like clouds they shape themselves and go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  Isn't Tennyson's \"Brook\" a beautiful title picture of a baby river\r\n  and its ways?\r\n\r\n  Speaking of human nature in rivers and apparent differences in\r\n  disposition, why is it that some of the rivers of California run\r\n  right through the mountain ranges from east to west--have evidently\r\n  cut their way--while others run along, meekly enough, between the\r\n  ranges? I'm sure from what we have learned about rivers that you\r\n  can tell how this happened as well as if you had been there when\r\n  the rivers were made; but if you can't think--after trying real\r\n  hard--you will find the answer in the Hide and Seek at the end of\r\n  the next chapter.\r\n\r\n  Beside being so prominent in the literature of the Bible and\r\n  so famous in history, the River Jordan is a most curious and\r\n  interesting stream, and every child should know about it. Here are\r\n  some of the things you will find: Why it is born partly grown, and\r\n  doesn't begin as a little stream, like the Mississippi; why it may\r\n  be said to be in both the tropical and temperate zones[13]; about\r\n  its two valleys, both of which it uses at the same time.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Britannica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: International.]\r\n\r\n  Another famous river over in that part of the world--it's the\r\n  biggest river in Western Asia, in fact--was born twins. See if you\r\n  can find such a river on the map. (The name of it is at the end of\r\n  the next chapter.) In the days of Alexander the Great these twin\r\n  rivers, which now unite in one after travelling along independently\r\n  for a while, were a good day's journey apart clear to the end. In\r\n  the article on this river in the Britannica, and in books of travel\r\n  you will find how, by a quaint and ingenious device, the river is\r\n  made to pump itself up hill and irrigate the fields; how history,\r\n  clear back to the beginning of civilization, is written in the\r\n  ruins of cities along its banks; how it used to put in part of its\r\n  time bounding the Roman empire, and how nowadays it is forced to\r\n  help support Arab river pirates and wild pigs.\r\n\r\n  Now let's go over into Africa with Doctor Livingstone and see how\r\n  a river can grind out a big, deep stone jar in solid rock.[15]\r\n  Rivers grind out these _pot-holes_ much as Indian women and the\r\n  American pioneers used to grind wheat and corn. (The river, you'll\r\n  find, uses pebbles for millstones.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: \"The Expedition to the Zambesi,\" page 63. One of these\r\nnatural water-jars that Doctor Livingstone found was as wide as a well\r\nand so deep it kept the water cool even under the broiling African sun.]\r\n\r\n  And what do you think of a waterfall big enough to swallow two\r\n  Niagaras? (It's the greatest waterfall in the world; so you must\r\n  have learned its name in your geography.) It's described on page\r\n  268 of Doctor Livingstone's book referred to in the foot-note. The\r\n  natives call it \"The Fall of the Thundering Smoke.\" They wonder how\r\n  water can smoke, and so that you can see the \"smoke\" twenty miles\r\n  away. You'll wonder, too, until you learn the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                                 (MAY)\r\n\r\n    When April steps aside for May,\r\n      Like diamonds all the rain-drops glisten;\r\n    Fresh violets open every day;\r\n      To some new bird each hour we listen.\r\n\r\n                                                --_Lucy Larcom._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAIRYLAND OF CHANGE\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful world it is, this world of green fields and perfume\r\nand blossoms of pink and gold! Where did it come from? How did it get\r\nhere out of the white winter? That bleak and barren winter that lay all\r\naround us everywhere only a few short weeks ago?\r\n\r\nJust suppose we had never seen apple trees in bloom, as we are now\r\nseeing them everywhere, and somebody should show us a little brown\r\nseed, and a piece of bark, and a piece of root, and a green leaf, and\r\na blossom, and an apple, and tell us they grew out of each other--were\r\nall made of the very same stuff.\r\n\r\nWell, just as sure as anything, you wouldn't believe it. I wouldn't\r\nbelieve it. We simply couldn't! But we've had this sort of thing all\r\naround us ever since we can remember, and we've got so used to it we\r\ndon't see anything wonderful about it. It _is_ wonderful just the same.\r\nThe Colossus of Rhodes, and Jupiter of Olympia, and the lighthouse of\r\nAlexandria, and all the other Seven Wonders of the World that people\r\nused to go so far to see, weren't anything to it.\r\n\r\nAnd to this day, how it all comes about is as much of a mystery as\r\never. Yet Nature does it right before our eyes, and over and over and\r\nover again! Even I, old as I am, and as much as I know, _I_ don't know\r\nhow she does it, but I do know how it all started; how Nature first\r\nbegan to change one thing into another. It was when she began making\r\nmarbles, granites, and other kinds of rock out of other kinds. That\r\nwas ages before she changed little brown seeds into big trees with\r\npink blossoms and red apples on them, or little brown cocoons into big\r\ngolden butterflies, or anything like that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. In the Fairyland of Change\r\n\r\nAhem! Ahem! (Pebble coughing.)\r\n\r\nI caught cold some several million years ago and I haven't got over it\r\nyet. That's why I'm a granite pebble instead of a slate pebble, or a\r\nsandstone pebble, or anything common. It's a part of the story of the\r\nfairyland of change, this cold of mine.\r\n\r\nAhem!\r\n\r\nWould you mind getting me a lump of sugar? I don't want it for my\r\ncold--it never does that any good--but because a lump of sugar goes so\r\nwell with this part of my story.\r\n\r\nYou notice the sugar lump is made up of little crystals, little\r\nbuilding blocks just as I am, just as all granites are. And the\r\ncrystals in the sugar and in the stone were made in the same way--by\r\nfirst heating and then cooling the material out of which they are made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CRYSTAL FAIRIES IN THE SUGAR-BOWL]\r\n\r\nWhen the earth's surface first cooled, the melted rock is supposed\r\nto have changed to granite. Melted rock, under the same conditions,\r\ndoes that to-day. So, for a while, granite must have been all the kind\r\nof rock there was. There was as yet no sandstone, no shells or bones\r\nto make limestone, no pebbles to help make conglomerate or \"pudding\r\nstone,\" no ground-up rock and soil to make slate.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the earth have been made over so many times that it is not\r\nprobable that any of the granites now \"living\" (so to speak) are the\r\nsame rocks that were made when the earth first cooled, but you can see\r\nthat we have a right to say what I was careful to say when I introduced\r\nmyself to you in the first chapter, that we belong to one of the _very\r\noldest families_--we Granites.\r\n\r\nAhem!\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of rock--a crystallized rock--with bands all through\r\nit, called gneiss (say \"nice\"). Gneiss is made from all kinds of rock\r\nincluding, of course, conglomerate; that is to say \"pudding stone\"[16]\r\nwarmed over.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: \"Pudding stone\" is a rock with pebbles all through it,\r\nlike the plums in a Christmas pudding. Its book name is \"conglomerate.\"]\r\n\r\n\"And what they did not eat that night, the queen next morning fried!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWN IN THE GREAT MELTING-POT\r\n\r\nBut how is old rock warmed over and made into new? You might easily\r\nguess that as the heart of the earth is melted rock the rock layers\r\nlying next to it would be melted, too, and so started on their way to\r\nbecoming crystallized rock. Crystallization in rock takes place from\r\nthe surface down, in the same way that maple syrup turns to sugar, as\r\nit does if allowed to stand undisturbed. So, as the central mass of\r\nrock is cooling from above toward the centre, we may suppose granite is\r\nstill being formed away down there, miles under our feet.\r\n\r\nBut there are other ways in which rocks make their own heat--rocks far\r\nabove this central molten heart of the world. One of these ways might\r\nremind you of how the mother hen gets her chickens to come out of the\r\neggs, for rocks hatch out new rocks by sitting on one another!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE CHAPTERS IN THE STORY OF MARBLE\r\n\r\n  If you're ever in New York City up around 192d Street, you can read\r\n  the three chapters in the life of a piece of marble right in the\r\n  rocks themselves, for there you'll see this mass of rock with that\r\n  granite dike pushing its way through. The rock on either side of\r\n  the dike is limestone, and this limestone, owing to the heat of\r\n  the lava which afterward hardened and became a \"dike,\" is full of\r\n  crystals; that is, began to turn to marble because of the heat. See\r\n  how the lava crumpled the limestone as it pushed its way up into\r\n  the original crack?\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the upper rocks generates heat in those beneath.\r\n\r\nThen when these deeply buried rocks come up into the upper world as\r\nparts of mountain chains, and the covering of the softer rocks is,\r\nby the rivers and by weathering, worn away, we find the granite. The\r\nwrinkling of the rocks which makes mountains also creates immense\r\npressure, and this is another great source of made-over rock. Such rock\r\nis found almost entirely in mountain regions. Some rocks, as shown\r\nin pebbles stretched out like a piece of gum, are heated by pressure\r\nwithout being crystallized. Often one of these stretched pebbles is\r\nthe only thing in a crystallized rock that shows what kind of rock it\r\nwas originally, all the finer material in it has been so changed. The\r\ndeeper down in the earth the rocks are the more apt they are to be\r\ncrystallized, because the rocks piled above them help to hold in the\r\nheat, just as thick blankets keep you warmest on a cold winter night.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINDS OF \"METAMORPHIC\" ROCK\r\n\r\nRock of any kind may be changed to crystallized rock. Where the\r\nconditions are not favorable for crystallization the rock is made more\r\nsolid, and material soaked out of the rocks above filters down into it.\r\nThe lower layers of sandstone may become almost as solid as glass, and\r\nare then called \"quartzite.\" Clay rocks are hardened into slate. Rocks\r\nchanged in any of these ways are called \"metamorphic\" rock, from two\r\nGreek words meaning \"to form over.\" But by \"metamorphic\" is usually\r\nmeant rock that has been crystallized.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICE HATCHING TEMPERATURE FOR ROCKS\r\n\r\nI compared the hatching of new rocks to the hatching of new chickens,\r\nbecause it is done by the rocks sitting on one another. But chicken\r\nhatching and rock \"hatching\" are alike in still another way. The rocks\r\nneed heat, but not too much heat. Too much heat melts them. It is only\r\nwhen they have cooled down a good deal that they begin to crystallize;\r\nand that, you see, wastes time.\r\n\r\nA nice hatching temperature for rocks is between 500 and 1000 degrees\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\nBut we might also compare Mother Nature's way of changing rocks to the\r\ncooking that goes on in our kitchens. She uses not only heat, but water\r\nand other things, including salt and soda. Both the salt and some of\r\nthe water in the rocks comes from--you'd hardly guess it--the seas! Not\r\nthe seas of to-day, but the seas of yesterday, when these rocks were\r\nmade. Then the pores were filled with water and the water has been kept\r\nshut in down there by the rocks above ever since.\r\n\r\nFrom this sea water comes the salt. The salt in the water, when heated,\r\nhelps to dissolve the rocks so that the different materials in them can\r\nseparate and come together again in new ways, and so form new rocks.\r\nYou know when you go to the lavatory to change your hands from dark to\r\nlight what a lot of difference it makes whether the water is hot or\r\ncold and whether you use soap. The soap helps dissolve the dirt on your\r\nhands just as the salt helps dissolve the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe soda which Nature also uses is particularly good for dissolving\r\nrock that will hardly dissolve without it; silica, for instance, out of\r\nwhich are made the hardest of the sand grains, the sand in sandstone,\r\nthe sharp, glassy edges of grass blades, and the blades of wheat, and\r\nthe stalks of corn. Whenever there is a great deal of silica in rock\r\nyou find soda mixed right with it. This, having the rocks already\r\nsalted and mixed with soda before putting them in the oven, Mother\r\nNature has always found _so_ convenient!\r\n\r\n\r\nONE PEBBLE MAY PLAY MANY PARTS\r\n\r\nI, in my time, may have been many kinds of rock. First, heaved up out\r\nof the sea by the earliest wrinkling of the cooling earth as granite;\r\nthen weathered away into soil and carried by rivers to the sea, where I\r\nwas remade the first time, maybe, as part of the \"dough\" in a pudding\r\nstone; then up again in an earth wrinkle and again back to sea, this\r\ntime to be made into some one of the clay stones, and then back to\r\ngranite again.\r\n\r\nAnyhow here I am, a little freckled granite pebble talking myself red\r\nin the face because I've got so much to say, such wonderful things to\r\ntell, and only a few hundred pages to tell it in!\r\n\r\n\r\nII. How Do They Know?\r\n\r\nBut, after all, how do they know that one rock changes into another? No\r\none ever caught a rock doing this, did they?\r\n\r\nNot quite, but almost. To explain, I must first tell you about the\r\nfossils that are found in stone. Haven't you often noticed in marble\r\ncurious figures that reminded you of sea-shells? They were sea-shells\r\nbut have been turned to stone, and things similarly changed while still\r\nkeeping their original form are called \"fossils.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the plants and the shell creatures of the sea die they fall to the\r\nbottom, and mud and sand settles over them and closes them in, much as\r\nyou shut leaves and flowers between the pages of a book. But while the\r\nbook presses the leaves of flowers out of shape these bodies of the\r\nwater-plants and shell creatures are slowly enclosed in a soft mass of\r\nmud that doesn't change their shapes at all. Then the particles that go\r\nto make up the soft bodies of these buried things are slowly dissolved\r\naway, and the minerals in the water and mud above them soak in and\r\ntake their places. It's like passenger after passenger in a car getting\r\nup and other passengers taking the vacant places. Finally this mass of\r\nlimey shells becomes buried deep under the sea, is turned to limestone,\r\nand when in course of time this part of the seashore rises--as we know\r\nshores have a way of doing--or is wrinkled up into a mountain, this\r\nlimestone becomes a part of the face of the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From a photograph by the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nSTORY OF THE LITTLE JEWEL-BOX\r\n\r\n  A kind of jewel-box? Yes, the kind geologists call a \"geode.\" It\r\n  began as a piece of limestone in which the underground waters had\r\n  dissolved a cavity. But these waters had already, in solution,\r\n  quartz which they had dissolved from quartz rock, and this quartz,\r\n  deposited little by little in the cavity, formed into crystals. The\r\n  quartz also made the surrounding walls more solid, so that when the\r\n  mass of limestone containing this pocket was cut away by erosion\r\n  this jewel-box remained, and, being rolled about in streams or by\r\n  the lap and plunge of waves, it was rounded.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nWOULDN'T WE SAY THE SAME THING?\r\n\r\nNow suppose where some great granite rock stood up through layers of\r\nother kinds of rock--looking as if it had pushed itself through like\r\nthe great granite boss on which Edinburgh Castle stands--you found\r\nthat wherever this intruder touched the other rock that rock was\r\ncrystallized. If we had just found all this out for ourselves, as the\r\ngeology people found it, we would say, just as they said:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FATHER, GRANDFATHER, AND THE CHILDREN IN THE PORPHYRY\r\nFAMILY\r\n\r\n  In this piece of porphyry you see three generations, all living\r\n  under one roof, as it were. Notice that six-sided crystal near the\r\n  centre? Compare it with other good-sized crystals that haven't\r\n  any distinctive shape. The reason for the difference is that the\r\n  shapeless ones have had some of their substance taken away to form\r\n  the smaller crystals. The dark mass is lava. In it the big crystals\r\n  formed. Then, from most of the big crystals the lava reabsorbed\r\n  material, and this material later turned into little crystals--the\r\n  \"grandchildren\" of the three generations.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what the granite did to the limestone and the other rocks\r\naround it to make them 'sugar,' or, as we say when speaking of rocks,\r\n'crystallize'? Syrup sugars when it is heated and then cooled without\r\nstirring. I wonder if this intruding mass that is now granite didn't\r\nspout up, in melted form, from down in the earth, and heat the rocks\r\non either side as it burst its way through. Then both this hot rock and\r\nits neighbors cooled and crystallized. That's it!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPLITTING MARBLE ROCKS IN THE QUARRY\r\n\r\n  This is a scene in a marble-quarry. The men are splitting up a\r\n  120-ton block. A writer in _Scribner's Magazine_, in which this\r\n  illustration originally appeared, also describes the process. The\r\n  wedges, carefully greased, are inserted in the drill-holes which,\r\n  for a horizontal split, are neither close together nor very deep,\r\n  as that is the natural plane of cleavage between the strata. Two\r\n  men with sledges go down the line giving each wedge a blow--not\r\n  too hard. Then two more men follow, and in go the wedges a little\r\n  farther. You see it wouldn't do to rush matters, or you'd fracture\r\n  the marble. The operation is so delicate, indeed, that the foreman\r\n  himself gives the final blows. Then the marble cracks from hole to\r\n  hole. For the vertical splits the holes, you notice, are closer\r\n  together. They are also deeper.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn some places you find these granite masses in great bosses, or\r\ndomelike rocks; elsewhere in long strips, like an iron bar thrust\r\nthrough other rocks; in still other places in great slabs between other\r\nrocks, like a warming pan pushed between the bed-sheets on a cold\r\nwinter night; but everywhere it touches other rocks these neighbors are\r\ncrystallized.\r\n\r\nNow, coming back to our friends the fossils, we sometimes find\r\nlimestone bordering one of these intrusive marble rocks with fossils in\r\nit, shading off into limestone containing the same kind of fossils. As\r\nyou get closer to the granite mass the fossils in the marble gradually\r\nfade away until you come to marble in which there are no fossils at all.\r\n\r\nSo there we get the whole story of the life, not only of marble but of\r\ngranite, and what happened to them in \"The Fairyland of Change\" and how\r\nit happened:\r\n\r\n_Chapter I._--The limestone was made in the sea and the shell creatures\r\nhelped to make it.\r\n\r\n_Chapter II._--Hot melted rock from the inside of the earth broke its\r\nway up through these limestone beds.\r\n\r\n_Chapter III._--Then, as the melted rock cooled, it changed to granite,\r\nand the limestone on either side, being first heated and then cooled,\r\ncrystallized and changed to marble.\r\n\r\nMen of science have still other ways of working out this problem as to\r\nwhether and how and why one kind of rock changes into another.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" we might say, \"aren't they satisfied? We are. It's all plain\r\nenough to us now that one kind of rock does change into another. Then\r\nwhy do these geologist people go on getting more evidence when they've\r\nalready got enough? It's like a boy learning two lessons when he only\r\nhas to recite in one; and whoever _heard_ of such a thing!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHESE BOYS JUST LOVE TO STUDY\r\n\r\nThe answer is that this \"going on\" is one of the many delights of\r\nstudy, particularly in Nature's books, when once you get the habit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From a photograph by Frith & Co., Ltd., Reigate_\r\n\r\n                     THE MARBLE ROCKS AT JABALPUR\r\n\r\n  The gorge of the \"Marble Rocks,\" near Jabalpur, India, is a mile\r\n  long and of an unearthly beauty of which even this little picture\r\n  will give you some idea. The walls gleam white and golden in the\r\n  sun. They are not really marble but limestone, which, as you will\r\n  learn in this chapter, is the stone that becomes marble in \"the\r\n  fairyland of change.\" It looks as if nature had begun the making\r\n  of marble columns in those cliffs, doesn't it? This is because the\r\n  cliff is cut up by joints. You can also make out in one of the\r\n  \"pillars\" the strata, or horizontal divisions of the rock, as it\r\n  was laid down in the sea.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong other things, the scientists search the pockets of the rocks,\r\nso to speak, for further evidence as to whether one kind changes into\r\nanother. Chemistry is a great help in doing this, and, of course,\r\nthe microscope. They find in this way that rocks that are full of\r\ncrystals, such as granite and marble, and that look so different\r\nfrom the rocks that are not crystallized--such as limestone and\r\nsandstone--have in them the very same substances--silica, lime, potash,\r\niron, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd again they put the oysters on the witness stand. (You remember\r\nhow, long ago, oysters helped tell that mountains were once a part of\r\nthe sea bottom.) They put a piece of limestone in a certain acid, and\r\nit bubbles and gives off a certain kind of gas. Then they do the same\r\nthing to an oyster-shell, and it gives out the same kind of gas. Then\r\nthey try it on a piece of marble and out comes that very gas again! So\r\nall three--the limestone, the oyster-shell, and the marble--must be\r\npretty close relations. Marble is just oyster and other shells warmed\r\nup and then allowed to cool.\r\n\r\nBut they don't stop here--these students of the rocks. It isn't enough\r\nthat all these facts point to one conclusion. They want to actually\r\n_try it out_. So what do they do but change chalk--which is a kind of\r\nvery soft limestone--into marble in the laboratory? This they do by\r\nheating the chalk and then cooling it under immense pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Fairies of the Fairyland of Change\r\n\r\nIf there really are fairies in this deep-down fairyland of change--and\r\nsurely there must be--I should say they were the very same fairies we\r\nfind in a lump of sugar--the crystals. For it is when these crystals\r\ntake different shapes--the very thing fairies are always doing, you\r\nknow--that things change into something else, so different you can\r\nhardly believe it. One could easily believe that charcoal and coal are\r\nrelated, they look so much alike in the face; but who would say that a\r\npiece of charcoal and a diamond were made of the very same stuff? They\r\nare. But diamonds are made of crystals and charcoal is not; and that\r\nmust be it. The carbon of the charcoal was never touched by the wand of\r\nthe Crystal Fairy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIX MEMBERS OF THE CRYSTAL FAMILY\r\n\r\nIntroducing six interesting members of the crystal family. The crystals\r\nof common salt and of gold, among others, take the form shown at _A_.\r\nAlum and diamonds crystallize as shown at _C_; while _B_ and _F_ belong\r\nto a system of crystals which we find built up into ice and arsenic.\r\n_D_ and _E_ are building-blocks for green vitriol, borax, and sulphate\r\nof soda.]\r\n\r\nA strange thing is that big crystals are always made up of little\r\ncrystals. So what looks like one crystal is really a United States\r\nof crystals, all like each other and each like all of them put\r\ntogether, much as our federal government repeats the form of the State\r\ngovernments, and the State governments duplicate the government at\r\nWashington on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SAND GRAINS AND THE CRYSTAL FAIRIES\r\n\r\nThe crystal fairies often give battered sand grains a new lease of\r\nlife and these pictures show how they do it. Fig. \"_a_\" is a single\r\nsand grain which has grown into crystal form; \"_b_\" shows parallel\r\ngrowths about a grain; \"_c_\" is a group of neighboring grains that have\r\ncrowded each other so in their growth that the crystal facets have been\r\ndestroyed. Sounds odd to speak of sand grains \"growing,\" doesn't it?\r\nBut they do!]\r\n\r\nBut why do the little crystals always come together in just such a way\r\nas to make big crystals shaped exactly like themselves?\r\n\r\nGoodness knows!\r\n\r\nBut whatever the how and the why of it may be, not only do the crystal\r\npeople stick as closely to the family pattern in dress as the Scotch\r\nHighlanders do to the plaids of their clans, but the crystals are\r\nclannish in another way. When a clay rock, for example, is dissolved\r\nby the heat, moisture, and chemicals down in the land of change,\r\nthe particles of the same kind that are scattered through it hunt\r\neach other out, and ever after cling together, like Emmy Lou and her\r\n\"nintimate friends.\" You've noticed how \"spotty\" granite is, haven't\r\nyou? This is because it is made up of different kinds of minerals; but,\r\nalthough the crystals in all follow the granite pattern, the particles\r\nof each kind of mineral \"flock together.\" The feldspars and the micas\r\nnever mix.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST TRY IT WITH A PIECE OF PAPER\r\n\r\nNow take a piece of writing paper and roll it into a tube and I'll show\r\nyou something else. Stand the roll up between your two hands and press\r\ndown on the top. It takes a good deal of pressure to bend or break it,\r\ndoesn't it? Now lay it on its side and squeeze. It breaks right away.\r\n\r\nBut how should the crystals in a piece of granite know that a column\r\nof anything will stand so much more weight when the pressure comes on\r\nthe ends than when it comes on the sides? They seem to know; for I'll\r\ntell you what they do, away down there in the dark of the earth. The\r\ncrystals stand at right angles to the pressure on the rock in which\r\nthey are forming. Sometimes, because of the movements of the earth\r\nas it shrinks and cracks, the crystals already formed in granite are\r\ncrushed over on their sides. Then, in course of time, they form again,\r\nbut _this_ time they stand upright, with their \"heads and shoulders\"\r\nagainst the burden--little Atlases supporting the world! And they\r\nnot only manage to get up and stand up straight when re-formed under\r\npressure, but they stand closer together than they did before; they\r\nclose up ranks, like soldiers with serious business before them.\r\n\r\nA crystal is made up of molecules, that is to say, little parts\r\nof itself. You can't see a molecule; you just have to think it.\r\nEach different thing in the world--as salt and sugar, boys and\r\nbumble-bees, little girls and butterflies--is made up of its own kind\r\nof molecules or little parts of itself. In order to grasp the idea of\r\ncertain scientific facts, the men of science thought of the molecules\r\nthemselves as being made of little bits of _themselves_, which the\r\nscientists called \"atoms.\" Now they find that it is necessary--in\r\norder to work out still further their ideas of how things are made\r\nand done and changed, in this wonderful mystery we call the world--to\r\nimagine these atoms as made up of what they call \"electrons.\" You\r\nmustn't think, however, that this is all mere fancy. We can, of course,\r\nthink of anything as made up of small particles or parts of itself\r\nwhich we can call \"molecules,\" and that these molecules are made of\r\nstill smaller parts which we can call \"atoms.\" But there is reason to\r\nbelieve that while each different kind of thing is made of its own\r\nkind of molecules and their atoms, all the atoms are made of the same\r\nthing--electrons or little bits of electricity. For reasons which need\r\nnot be gone into here, it is known that electrons actually exist. These\r\nelectrons are so much smaller than an atom that there is as much room\r\nfor them to move around in an atom as there is for the planets to move\r\naround the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd they _do_ move--travelling round and round. There are, even in so\r\nsmall a thing as a grain of sand, untold numbers of these circling\r\nworlds; systems like the sun with its planets and other vast star\r\nsystems of the sky.\r\n\r\nAnd that, it is thought, may be one of the secrets of the continual\r\nchange of things; clay rock changing to granite, granite to soil, soil\r\nto fruit, fruit to children, and so on--everything on the move and the\r\nelectrons doing the moving--carrying the changes, so to speak--these\r\nwonderful little myriad messenger boys of the universe!\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  Don't imagine, for all I've talked so long about them, that I've\r\n  told you everything there is to know about the crystal fairies. For\r\n  example, did you know that if it wasn't for the crystal people we\r\n  wouldn't have any ice? (_Ice._)\r\n\r\n  You will also find that if it wasn't for ice--ice and the\r\n  Greeks--we wouldn't have the word \"crystal\" at all. (_Crystal._)\r\n\r\n  One of the most striking things in the whole conduct of these\r\n  clever crystal folks you will find in reading about ice. If it\r\n  wasn't for a peculiar--a very peculiar--habit the ice crystals\r\n  have, all the waters of the world that ever freeze at all, would\r\n  freeze solid to the bottom and never _would_ thaw out!\r\n\r\n  I'll tell you this much about it:\r\n\r\n  While everything else in the world--including boys and\r\n  girls--contracts when it gets cold, ice expands, and so becomes\r\n  lighter than water, and so floats.\r\n\r\n  And yet the ice crystals know how to contract as well as expand,\r\n  and that's why ice sometimes builds stone walls, as we will see\r\n  when we come to study \"The Stones of the Field\" in July.\r\n\r\n  Shaking still water that is cold enough to freeze but hasn't frozen\r\n  makes the crystal fairies get very busy in their ice factories.\r\n  And it looks very much as if the fairies themselves warmed up with\r\n  their work; for, after this shaking, the temperature of the water\r\n  rises ten degrees at the very same time it is freezing!\r\n\r\n  You will also find that when the weather is cold enough ice itself\r\n  freezes, gets harder and harder with the cold; that ice will melt\r\n  ice; that two blocks of ice will grow into one if you give them a\r\n  chance; that ice crystals are apt to be born twins; that these twin\r\n  crystals are fond of gardening--at least, they raise \"ice flowers\";\r\n  that the ice crystals are so punctual in their coming and going in\r\n  water that they are used to help place the markings on thermometers\r\n  just right, so that we can tell exactly how cold or hot we are.\r\n\r\n  All this just about the crystals of the ice, but the work of the\r\n  crystal people in making snowflakes is even more wonderful. In\r\n  the bound volumes of St. Nicholas for March, 1882, in your Public\r\n  Library you will find a most interesting account of a man in\r\n  Vermont who began studying snowflakes and taking their pictures\r\n  when he was a boy. He's known all over the world as the great\r\n  authority on snowflakes. In the Encyclopedia Americana you will\r\n  find a long article by him in which he tells the many interesting\r\n  things he has learned about the ways of the fairies of the snow And\r\n  how many pictures do you suppose he has in his snowflake gallery\r\n  now? Over a thousand, and no two alike!\r\n\r\n  Just to think! Some of these wonderful little people of the\r\n  fairyland of change sit at the table with us at every meal--the\r\n  sugar crystals. And they are among the most interesting members of\r\n  the family. Under the word _Sugar_ you will find that the sugar\r\n  crystals themselves eat and grow. But what do you suppose they eat?\r\n  Not sugar. (You may easily guess, however, they have a sweet tooth.)\r\n\r\n  Yes, and at their home table, before they come to _your_ home\r\n  table, they have their regular meals, and they are not allowed a\r\n  second helping until they have eaten the first!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswers to Conundrums in H. & S.

Gannet_: \"_Sunday on the Hill-Top_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECRETS OF THE HILLS\r\n\r\nI. In the Bad Land Library\r\n\r\nIt has been said[17] that crystals are dreaming of life, they act\r\nso like living things. We may imagine the crystals in the granite\r\nrocks which first came into being with the cooling of the fire globe,\r\ndreaming out the long procession of life and change that followed them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: John Burroughs: \"The Breath of Life.\"]\r\n\r\nBut what nightmares they must have had when they foresaw such creatures\r\nas the one on page 23, that grotesque, that unbelievable combination of\r\nbird and beast, the cerotosaurus! The bones of such monsters are one of\r\nthe most astonishing secrets of the hills.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE BAD LANDS GOT THEIR NAME\r\n\r\n  \"The Bad Lands are so called because they are bad for\r\n  travelling--that is, if you're in anything of a hurry!\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Bad Lands of South Dakota, in which, as in other parts of our great\r\nWest, so many bones of the ancients have been found, got their name\r\nbecause they are so bad for travelling; that is to say, if you are in\r\nanything of a hurry. But if you are just looking around--during your\r\nvacation, in June, say--they are anything but bad lands. They are full\r\nof interesting secrets. This secret of the ancient bones is only one\r\nof them. Another thing they lead us into is the secret history of the\r\nhills themselves; and as this particular book is mainly about the face\r\nof the earth, the story back of the landscape, as it appears to the\r\ntraveller, we shall give the rest of this chapter to the origin of the\r\nHill family, using the word \"hill\" in its broadest sense. If you have\r\nlooked it up in the dictionary you have found that what people call a\r\n\"hill\" depends a good deal on where they are. The Bad Lands are really\r\nhills; but in South Dakota, where these particular bad lands are, they\r\nalso have what they call the Black Hills, which are really mountains,\r\nbecause they \"mounted\" to get where they are.[18] They wrinkled up,\r\njust as the continents themselves did, when they came out of the sea.\r\nMost of the great mountain systems of the world were made in this way,\r\nbut table-lands may be so cut up by streams in course of time that they\r\nlook like mountains.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Mr. Pebble did not mean to say, I am sure, that the\r\nword \"mountain\" comes from \"mount,\" used in the sense of rising. The\r\noriginal of the word mountain comes from the language of the People of\r\nthe Seven Hills, the Romans, and means a great mass of rock or earth\r\nthat sticks up.--_Translator._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Painted by Dewitt Parshall. In the possession of the\r\nMetropolitan Museum of Art_\r\n\r\n                        THE CATSKILLS IN A MIST\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Catskill Mountains are of this type, while real mountains may be\r\nso worn down that you would take them for plains. You see, with the\r\nHills and the Mountains, as with other royal families, it isn't the\r\nimportance of the individual that counts, but the ancestry.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of real mountain, beside the folded-up kind, is the\r\nmountain that is made where a rocky plain is split up into great stone\r\nblocks by the movements of the earth crust, as it settles around the\r\nshrinking centre. In the settling and crushing together of the rock\r\ncover around the shrinking ball within, some of the blocks drop down,\r\nand the blocks that are left sticking up make cliffs. Mountain ranges\r\nso made have long, gentle slopes on the side opposite the cliffs. Then\r\nthere are volcanic mountains. Fujiyama, the sacred mountain of Japan,\r\nis one of these.\r\n\r\nMountains are also formed where the molten rock on the inside of the\r\nearth is forced up under layers of rock nearer the surface. This lifts\r\nthese rock layers into domes. In the course of time the rivers and the\r\nweather wear away the overlying rocks, leaving the hard central core\r\nstanding out. Harder layers of the overlying rock, wearing down less\r\nrapidly than the other layers, often stand out as circular ridges with\r\nvalleys in between, so that the central core looks like some old ring\r\nmaster at a circus. The Bear Paw Mountains and the Little Snowies of\r\nMontana are mountains of this type.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE MOUNTAINS GET THEIR PEAKS\r\n\r\nMost mountain peaks, except those of the volcanoes, are remnants of\r\nhard rock which have been left standing while the rivers and the\r\nweather cut away the softer rock around them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE HIMALAYAS THEY MIGHT CALL THESE \"HILLS\"\r\n\r\nHigh as these mountains are--we are right on the roof of the\r\nRockies--if they were in the Himalayas they might be called \"hills,\"\r\nbecause there the scenery grows so much taller. What does the sharpness\r\nof the peaks say as to the age of these mountains? Compared with the\r\nAppalachians, for example?]\r\n\r\nIn regions of gently rolling country even small hummocks are sometimes\r\ncalled \"mountains,\" while out West, where scenery grows so tall,\r\nthe Black Hills seem to the people only stepping-stones to the big\r\nRockies. So they call them \"hills.\" In the region of the Himalaya\r\nMountains--mountains that don't think anything, you remember, of\r\nclimbing up 16,000 to 30,000 feet in the air--a peak of 10,000 feet is\r\noften called a \"hill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Hills That Were Moved In\r\n\r\nNearly every region has hills, because every region has or has had\r\nrunning streams and the streams have carved out the hills. But there\r\nare kinds of hills that aren't home-made; they were made elsewhere and\r\nmoved in. I believe this is the biggest hill secret of all, speaking of\r\nhills proper and not of mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From Norton's \"Elements of Geology.\" By permission of\r\nGinn and Company_\r\n\r\nKAME SCENERY IN NEW YORK STATE]\r\n\r\nAlmost all over the northern part of North America, as well as much of\r\nEurope and Asia, there are mounds, heaps, and hills of various shapes\r\nand sizes made up of a mixture of pebbles, sand, and clay. In the\r\nUnited States these heaps make a big line of hills, like a procession\r\nof ancient Indian chiefs, with bowed heads and stooped shoulders,\r\nplodding back to the land of their fathers. And, sure enough, there\r\nthey go from down East clear across country to the far West and then\r\nup North, where, as we know, these hill-moving giants, the glaciers,\r\ncame from.[19] For, beginning with Perth Amboy, N. J., say, you will\r\nfind them marching on through Elmira, N. Y., skirting the suburbs of\r\nCincinnati, winding their way through Indiana and Iowa up through\r\nWisconsin to the Dakotas and Montana, and so back into Canada.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Did you suspect the giants of this chapter were our old\r\nfriends the glaciers of the Ice Age, when I first began talking about\r\nthem?]\r\n\r\nWhen the geologists first began digging into these hills they not only\r\nfound them as full of pebbles as a Christmas pudding is full of plums,\r\nbut the pebbles were of all kinds--sandstone, limestone, slate, granite.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACK FROST DIDN'T DO IT!\r\n\r\n\"These different pieces of stone didn't come from the breaking up by\r\nfrost of the rock beds on which we now find them,\" said Some Wise Man,\r\n\"for then they would all have been of the same kind of rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"And besides,\" said Some Wise Man No. 2, \"they would not have been\r\nshaped into pebbles with the edges rounded off, as all pebbles are by\r\nthe waves of lakes or the sea or the water of flowing streams. So these\r\npebbles must have come from somewhere else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and a long way off,\" remarked Some Wise Man No. 3; \"for look,\r\nthere aren't any rock beds anywhere around here from which some of\r\nthese pebbles could have been made.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough,\" said Wise Man No. 4, \"and I know what brought these\r\nlittle foreigners. It was a great flood; for water moves not only\r\npebbles and clay, but, in times of flood, good-sized cobblestones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS MEANT BY THE \"DRIFT\" THEORY\r\n\r\nSo, for a long time, it was believed that the material in these hills\r\nwas drifted in by the waters. This was called the \"drift\" theory, and,\r\nalthough it is now known that this theory was not the true one, such\r\nheaps of clay and stones are still called \"drift.\"\r\n\r\nBut the learned men kept on digging into the question and into the\r\nhills, and finally more things were observed.\r\n\r\n\"Did you notice this?\" said one. \"The material is not separated into\r\nlayers and divided up into coarse, finer, finest as the sediment of\r\npebbles, sand, and mud is separated and divided when it settles along\r\nshores. These pebbles, this sand and clay, are all mixed up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at this, will you?\" (Here imagine a Learned Somebody picking\r\nup a pebble with a scratched face like mine.) \"Water never scratched\r\nanything like that. Here are a lot more of these pebbles, all with\r\ntheir faces scratched.\"\r\n\r\n\"And just see how all these scratched pebbles have flat faces,\" cried\r\nanother of these famous grown-up boys in these great field excursions.\r\n\"It looks to me as if they had been ground against something\r\nhard--another rock, say; and for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE QUESTION WAS FINALLY SETTLED\r\n\r\nWell, to make a long story short, they found that the glaciers of\r\nthe Ice Age, those great bodies of flowing ice, were the only things\r\nthat could have brought all this material together from such widely\r\nseparated regions (as shown by the different kinds of pebbles), and\r\nleft them all mixed up as they were; and the faces of many pebbles\r\nscratched and flattened where they had been ground along.\r\n\r\nAnd then, to put the question entirely beyond dispute, they find that\r\nthe glaciers are carrying down pebbles and stuff in just this way\r\nto-day, and piling it up in hills in the valleys at the foot of the\r\nmountains. Only the hills of to-day are much smaller, because the\r\nglaciers themselves are so small compared with the giants of the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE OLD MEN MOVED THE HILL FURNITURE ABOUT\r\n\r\nThis picture of a glacier in Alaska shows you just how the Old Men\r\nof the Mountain moved the hills about, that time. As indicated by\r\nthe white lines--which, of course, were added to the picture for the\r\npurpose--the Alaska glacier melted back, leaving just such heaps of\r\npebbles, boulders, and soil as made certain types of hills. Then from\r\n1910 to 1913 it advanced again, thus picking up the very hills it had\r\nlaid down and setting them farther along, just as the glaciers did in\r\nthe Ice Age.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE HILL FURNITURE WAS MOVED ABOUT\r\n\r\nDuring the Ice Age, when glaciers were all the fashion, they flowed\r\ndown, and then, as we have seen, melted back a certain distance; then\r\nthey flowed down again. Sometimes in later visits they flowed further\r\nthan before, and in so doing, you see, picked up some of the very\r\nhills they had previously laid down and set them along somewhere else.\r\nSometimes we find different rows of hills, one right alongside the\r\nother. This shows where the glacier melted away toward the mountains,\r\npaused, then melted again and so on, each time leaving a group of hills\r\nand not coming back there and disturbing them any more.\r\n\r\nSuch hills as we have been speaking of may be steep or gentle, and from\r\na few feet to more than 1,000 feet high, although they are seldom as\r\nhigh as 1,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAnd there are other kinds of hills made by the glaciers. One of the\r\nmost curious of these remind you of the serpent mounds left by the\r\nmound builders in Ohio. These hills are the deposits left by the\r\nstreams, the veins inside the glacier's great body. The soil in them\r\nis also apt to be in layers like the deposits of other rivers. These\r\nhills wind along like serpents, because they reproduce the bends in the\r\nstreams inside the glacier. Such hills are called \"eskers.\" They are\r\nseldom more than a few rods wide and 10 feet or so in height. They run\r\nfor 10, 20, 40, 50, and sometimes 100 miles.\r\n\r\nAround Boston, and all along Cape Cod and in parts of New York and\r\nWisconsin, you will see other hills called \"drumlins\"; and you will see\r\nplenty of them, too. It is estimated that there are 6,000 in western\r\nNew York and 5,000 in southern Wisconsin, and they are all around\r\nBoston. Bunker Hill is a drumlin. You wouldn't have to tell an Irish\r\nboy what \"drumlin\" means, as they have these hills in Ireland, too, and\r\nfrom Ireland came the name. The word means \"little hill.\"\r\n\r\nBut while Mr. Glacier made the drumlins of the stuff he brought with\r\nhim, he enjoyed himself (at least let us hope so) tobogganing on hills\r\nhe found ready made. These hills are real mountains; usually the\r\ngranite heart of the mountain, because only a very strong rock could\r\nstand having one of these playful giants riding over him and live to\r\ntell the tale. Such glacier \"slides\" are referred to as \"domes\" or\r\n\"round tops\" or \"bald mountains.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Agassiz, the great scientist who spent so many years studying the\r\nmotion of glaciers, could tell from the height of one of these bald and\r\nrounded hills how high the glacier was that rode over it. For instance,\r\nthe glaciers rode over what is known as Blue Mountain in Pennsylvania,\r\nwhich is 1,500 feet high. \"Then,\" Mr. Agassiz would have said, \"the\r\nglaciers that did that must have been at least 2,000 feet thick; for a\r\nglacier can only flow over a rocky mass when it is half as tall again\r\nas the rock.\"\r\n\r\nYou see it is the mass of it, the pressure of its own weight, that\r\nboosts the glacier up the slide. It seems almost like lifting oneself\r\nby one's boot-straps, doesn't it?\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Ants and the Volcanoes\r\n\r\nBeside all the hills we have mentioned there are several others, well\r\nworth looking into; ant-hills, for example, not only because ants are\r\nso interesting in themselves but because the ants helped to answer what\r\nfor a long time was one of the puzzles of science, \"How are volcanoes\r\nmade?\"\r\n\r\nWhen your mother's mother went to school--or it may have been back in\r\nyour mother's mother's mother's time--a little girl, on being asked in\r\nthe geography class, \"What is a volcano?\" was expected to say something\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n\"Please, teacher, it's a mountain with a hole in it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  _From a photograph.

Romans_\r\n\r\n  SACRED FUJIYAMA AND ITS COUNTERPART FOUR THOUSAND MILES AWAY\r\n\r\n  On the top is the famous Fujiyama, the sacred mountain of Japan,\r\n  and on the bottom Mount Rainier in the State of Washington. Although\r\n  they are more than four thousand miles apart, the two volcanoes\r\n  look as if they had been cast in the same mould, owing to the\r\n  uniform system by which volcanoes are built up.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WISE MEN AND THE ANT CRATERS\r\n\r\nIt does look it, doesn't it? But, what is still more striking, it\r\n_isn't_ a mountain with a hole in it at all, if you mean, as the\r\nlittle girl in the geography class meant, that it was once an ordinary\r\nmountain and then had a hole put through it. For a long time it was\r\nthought that volcanoes were simply mountains through which fire and\r\nlava from the interior had forced its way. Finally, however, some\r\nscientist thought perhaps of his Proverbs 6:6. In any event wise as he\r\nmust have been--how else could he have been a scientist?--he went to\r\nthe ant, learned her ways and became wiser. It was by noticing how the\r\nants build their little craters with the sand and clay they carry from\r\ntheir underground homes that men got the idea that volcanoes may be\r\nbuilt up in much the same way. So they set to observing Mr. Volcano's\r\nhabits more closely, and sure enough, the ant had told the answer! The\r\nstones, lava, cinders, and the stone dust called \"volcanic ash\" are\r\nshot out by the explosion, and coming down in showers pile around the\r\nopening, as the ant piles the pellets around the entrance to her nest.\r\nAs the explosions keep on the crater is piled higher and higher, and\r\nthe stones, cinders, and things, rolling down the sides, spread the\r\npile out at the bottom, much as the ant drops pellets over the edge\r\nof her growing pile, and so both the cone-like ant-hill and the big\r\nvolcanic cone are built up.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY THE VOLCANO DOES NOT SMOKE\r\n\r\nBut here is something about volcanoes that will surprise most people.\r\nThey throw mud, they throw stones, but they don't smoke. What we call\r\nsmoke is the steam that makes--or at least helps make--the explosion.\r\nIt often has the color of brown smoke because of the rock which has\r\nbeen blown into dust. Neither do volcanoes make \"ashes.\" What is called\r\n\"ash\" is this rock powder, made when the rocks are blown into pieces by\r\nthe sudden expansion of the water in them into steam.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY VOLCANOES SEEM TO FLAME\r\n\r\nNeither do volcanoes flame, although they are supposed to. Only rarely\r\ndoes flame issue from a volcano, and then only to a moderate extent,\r\ndue to the burning of the hydrogen gas. What seem to be huge flames\r\nare the lights from the molten lava in the crater shining back on the\r\nsteam clouds above; and these apparent flames rise and fall and vary in\r\nbrightness because of the rise and fall of the lava.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest of volcanic eruptions--that is, the welling up\r\nof melted rock from within the earth--have not built cones. The\r\nlava spread out into vast plains in India and Abyssinia and in our\r\nnorthwestern coast States. Great cracks in the earth cross one\r\nanother. It is at the crossroads that the volcanoes are apt to form,\r\nwhile out of the cracks leading up to these crossroads the lava spreads\r\nin sheets. Mount Shasta began at one of these traffic centres. It is a\r\nbig brother of the landscape which it overlooks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"BUT VOLCANOES DO NOT SMOKE!\"\r\n\r\n  This is an eruption of Vesuvius. You would think it was throwing\r\n  out smoke like a gigantic locomotive, wouldn't you, if you hadn't\r\n  read the text? The darker masses, which look so much like mingled\r\n  smoke and steam, are shadows. It is probably eight to ten miles\r\n  high--that cloud.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLava, before it cools and for some centuries afterward, is the last\r\nthing you would think of farming on, perhaps, but leave it to the\r\nlittle chemists of the water and the air and it will decay into the\r\nrichest land you ever saw. That is why they raise the finest wheat and\r\nthe best fruit in the world right in the parts of Washington and Oregon\r\nthat were once covered by the lava flood.\r\n\r\nNot only do volcanoes help to supply us with food by making rich soil\r\nof the eruptions of the past, but all life might disappear from the\r\nearth if they didn't go on exploding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW VOLCANOES BLOW BUBBLES\r\n\r\n  The surface of lava is apt to bubble like hot mush; and for a\r\n  similar reason, the expansion of the gases within it. (In the case\r\n  of the mush it is the mixture of gases we call \"air.\") When such\r\n  lava cools you have sponge-like masses such as this.\r\n]\r\n\r\nPlants must have carbon and they get it from the air, but the amount\r\nof it in proportion to their needs is never large. Moreover, every bit\r\nof coal that is formed--and coal is being made to-day just as it was\r\nin the coal ages, although not in such quantities--takes carbon from\r\nthe air and locks it up. Every bit of limestone deposited on the floor\r\nof the sea locks up more carbon. But, fortunately, immense quantities\r\nof carbon are given back to the air through the gases thrown out by\r\nvolcanoes, thus offsetting these losses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From a photograph by the American Museum of Natural History_\r\n\r\nROCKS AND BOMBS THROWN BY MOUNT PELÉE\r\n\r\n  Look at these giant rocks thrown out by Mount Pelée in 1902.\r\n  Compare them with the man and you will realize how big they are.\r\n  The rounded rocks in the foreground are volcanic \"bombs\"--masses of\r\n  lava discharged by successive outbursts of volcanic gases and given\r\n  their shape by being whirled through the air.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEN IS A VOLCANO DEAD?\r\n\r\n  This is Mount Rainier with its shroud of snow, reflected in Mirror\r\n  Lake. To all appearances it is as dead as dead can be; but until\r\n  after a volcano goes off you never can be entirely sure whether it\r\n  is dead or not; and then, of course, you know it isn't!\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN IS A VOLCANO REALLY DEAD?\r\n\r\nWhen is a volcano dead? You never can tell. A volcano goes off when it\r\nwants to, quite regardless of the fact that it has had the reputation\r\nfor a thousand years of being dead. And the worst of it is volcanoes\r\nare like guns--only more so. A gun doesn't shoot any harder because\r\nit wasn't supposed to be loaded; but the volcano, if it breaks out\r\nunexpectedly, is violent in proportion to the length of time it has\r\nbeen apparently dead. This is the reason. The original vent becomes\r\nplugged up with the cooled lava. This plug being harder than the rest\r\nof the mountain, the next outbreak is forced to take a new course,\r\nand the longer the forces of explosion are held back the greater the\r\naccumulation of energy and the more violent the discharge.\r\n\r\nBut why do volcanoes go off at all? Why can't they be quiet and\r\nwell-behaved like other mountains? Nobody knows for sure. On one thing\r\nall scientific men seem to be now agreed; namely, that while the rocks\r\ninside the earth are hot enough to melt they are hard as steel, owing\r\nto the tremendous pressure of the rocks above them, and one theory\r\nabout volcanic eruptions is that they are caused by the release of the\r\npressure on this rock in one place and a pressing down in another, as\r\nthe earth's crust settles and crumples around the centre. Some of this\r\nrock--that on which the pressure is released--melts and rises under the\r\nfolds of rising rock, and so makes the granite hearts of the greater\r\nmountains. Some of it wells up through the cracks in the rock and\r\nspreads in lava fields, while some of it gushes up and explodes at the\r\npoints where cracks cross and so make volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThis is one theory, but there are others. The latest is so big that we\r\nwill have to take it into the mind in sections.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATEST THEORY OF ERUPTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Imagine the interior of the earth divided into three zones. The\r\ncentral zone, of course, is the hottest. Between this central zone and\r\nthe zone reaching down forty miles or so from the surface is a middle\r\nzone. (Think of a doughnut ball inside a doughnut ring, with space\r\nbetween the ball and ring. That will give you the idea.)\r\n\r\n2. From what is known of the laws of heat it is assumed that the flow\r\nof heat from the central to the middle zone is greater than the loss of\r\nheat from the central to the outer zone. Thus the heat income of the\r\nmiddle zone would constantly exceed its outlay, and so it would get\r\nhotter and hotter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MYSTERIOUS SHAFT OF MOUNT PELÉE\r\n\r\n  In 1902, after the first explosion, Mount Pelée continued its\r\n  eruptions for several months, and in the late stages there slowly\r\n  rose, through the crater, this strange shaft of red-hot lava,\r\n  like a great iron beam forged by giant hammers in Vulcan's famous\r\n  blacksmith-shop. As it rose it crumbled and finally fell to pieces.\r\n  It was forced up by the gases beneath and shaped by the crater\r\n  through which it came; but can you conceive of anything more weird\r\n  and awesome?\r\n]\r\n\r\n3. This middle zone is made up of different kinds of rock that require\r\ndifferent degrees of heat to melt them. So some parts of this zone\r\nwould melt and form pockets of liquid rock, while other parts were\r\nstill unmelted.\r\n\r\n4. These masses of liquid rock would also tend to melt their own way\r\nupward, especially when given a lift by gases; for gases would be given\r\noff, also, in this heating and melting process, and tend to work their\r\nway toward the surface, carrying with them the liquid rock.\r\n\r\n5. Now the greater the pressure under which a thing is kept the more\r\ndifficult it becomes for it to flow; the less the pressure the more\r\neasily it flows and the longer it remains in the fluid state. So as it\r\nrose fluid rock would require less heat to keep it fluid and would have\r\nmore heat left over for melting its way up. Then, being joined by other\r\nfluid travelers, the entire mass would finally come to a crack in the\r\nearth. Finally, you see, it would be only a matter of five miles or so\r\nof comparatively clear track up to the land of the fresh air and the\r\nblue sky where the rest of us live and where the volcanologists (the\r\nmen who make a special study of volcanoes) would be waiting to give it\r\nwelcome!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOLCANOES AND THE SEA\r\n\r\nIf you will locate with red ink the volcanoes on the world map you will\r\nnotice that volcanoes, like mountains, seem fond of the sea. Moreover,\r\nwhile a large proportion of mountain chains are near sea water, and\r\nsome even dip their feet into it, volcanoes bob up right in the seas\r\nthemselves. Not only do the land volcanoes make a great circle of\r\nfire 22,000 miles long around the rim of the Pacific, but within this\r\nimmense amphitheater are the islands of our story books \"scattered in\r\npleiads\" over the ocean. These islands are simply the tops of sea\r\nvolcanoes. Of all the active volcanoes, the great majority are on\r\nislands or along the borders of continents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE FIRING-LINES OF THE VOLCANOES]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA\r\n\r\nLast of all in this story of the secrets of the hills, let us speak of\r\nthe big brothers of the family--the mountains.\r\n\r\nYou remember in the story of how the continents came up out of the\r\nsea about wise old Xenophanes of Colophon, who figured out that the\r\nmountains must at one time have been under the sea and why he thought\r\nso, don't you? (page 13). Now get your geography and come here a\r\nmoment; I want to show you something else. Turn to the map of North\r\nAmerica. Where are the great mountain chains? Nearly all along the\r\nborders of the sea. Now look at the map of South America, and where\r\nare the mountains? Along the borders of the sea. Then take Europe,\r\nAsia, Africa, Australia, and you see the same thing. Usually the main\r\nmountain chains are along the sea border or they stand near the borders\r\nof what was once a sea; as in case of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From Norton's \"Elements of Geology.\"\r\n   By permission of Ginn and Company_\r\n\r\n                 A BABY MOUNTAIN THAT STOPPED TO REST\r\n\r\n  A mountain, as you can readily imagine, isn't made in a day. Here\r\n  is a little mountain near Hancock, Virginia, that started up ages\r\n  ago and then stopped to rest; one of the ripples in which the great\r\n  Appalachian waves died away. This baby mountain has no granite mass\r\n  in its centre, as big mountains have, because the wrinkling didn't\r\n  reach down far enough into the earth to release the pressure on the\r\n  molten rock.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhy should mountains show such a fancy for salt water? It seems\r\nstrange, doesn't it? I know why it is because I helped make a mountain\r\nmyself once--up on the Canada Coast it was--and I learned a good deal\r\nof the mountains and their ways. I will tell you about the mountains\r\nand the sea a little later; after I have told you some other things.\r\nFirst of all, this is how the Granite family helped make mountains. As\r\nthe great stone sides of the mountain rise the enormous pressure on\r\nthe melted rock farther down in the earth is released, and is forced\r\nup under the mountain as it rises. Then, cooling, it crystallizes into\r\ngranite, as explained on page 131.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNTAINS MADE TO ORDER\r\n\r\n  Of course nobody ever watched a mountain crumpling up in the way\r\n  mountains are believed to crumple up, the process is so slow. Yet,\r\n  to try out the theory, geologists in the universities make layers\r\n  of different material, corresponding to the strata of different\r\n  kinds of stone, and then subject this composition to pressure at\r\n  both ends, as the earth crust is supposed to be pressed in the\r\n  crumpling process. The result is that these artificial strata take\r\n  similar forms to those we see in mountain rock. And that's the\r\n  answer!\r\n\r\n  Notice the similarity of the rock wrinkles in the baby mountain in\r\n  Virginia and these imitation mountains of the laboratory.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY MOUNTAINS RUN NORTH AND SOUTH\r\n\r\nLook at your relief map once more. Which way do the mountains run in\r\nNorth America? In South America? In Africa? They all run in a general\r\nnorth and south direction, don't they? Do you see why? The fact that\r\nthey were made along the coasts of the oceans would make them run north\r\nand south, too, wouldn't it? The same thing explains why the Alps do\r\nnot run north and south. They were made by the sinking of a sea that\r\nruns east and west, and so they started out to run east and west, too;\r\nthen they got a wrench, the particulars of which we need not go into\r\nhere, and were much mixed up, as we find them to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE EARTH SLOWED UP\r\n\r\nBut there is another thing that may have helped to make many great\r\nmountains run north and south. Bedtime and sunrise used to come a\r\ngood deal oftener than they do now, for then the earth turned faster\r\non its axis. It turned fastest of all at the equator, just as it does\r\nto-day. So the lands in the equatorial belt were pulled up and the belt\r\nenlarged. Then, as the speed of the globe slackened, the enlarged belt\r\nbegan to wrinkle because there was not the same amount of centrifugal\r\nor \"fly-away-from-the-centre\" force to make it stand out. So wrinkles\r\ncame at right angles to the belt, just as do the waist gathers in a\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nAnd now about the mystery of the mountains and the sea. When we visit\r\nthe rock mills of the sea along in October[20] we shall notice, among\r\nother things, that the rock is made along the sea border, and that the\r\ncoarsest sediment settles nearest the land. As a result this part of\r\nthe deposit is built up faster than that farther off shore, and as it\r\ngets heavier and heavier it sinks. The deposits farther away from the\r\nshore sink, also, but more slowly because these deposits are not piled\r\nup so fast. Now, if you come down on one end of a seesaw what happens\r\nto the other end? It goes up, doesn't it? The effect of this sinking of\r\nthe rocks of the sea upon the rocks of the adjoining land is something\r\nlike that. The rocks that make the continents extend out under the sea,\r\nand the weight of the newly laid stone on the sea margin end not only\r\ntips the rock beds up, but, sinking in toward the continental mass,\r\nwrinkles it up, as the pages of this book will wrinkle if you push them\r\nfrom the front edge. So you get your mountains along the sea border.\r\nAnd they are in parallel ranges, because the land is crumpled up into\r\nseveral folds, like a table-cloth pushed from one side.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Chapter X, \"The Autumn Winds and the Rock Mills of the\r\nSea.\"]\r\n\r\n\"But,\" you say, \"how about the Rocky Mountains? And the Carpathian\r\nMountains in Europe, not to mention several others? _They_ are not on\r\nthe borders of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY SOME MOUNTAINS ARE FAR FROM THE SEA\r\n\r\nThat's no sign they weren't near a sea border at some time. Let me\r\njust ask you. Suppose you found that most of the great mountain\r\nchains are on the borders of seas, and suppose you had figured out\r\nthe reasons I have just been giving, then what would you do if you\r\nfound a few mountains far back from the sea? You would probably try to\r\nfind how they got moved back, wouldn't you? That's just what _other_\r\nmen of science did. A study of the rocks of the mountains themselves\r\nand other things bearing on the question goes to show that since the\r\nmountains were made the sea might have retired from regions where it\r\nhad previously advanced, as it did in the case of the Mississippi\r\nValley, or the land may have risen between these mountains and the\r\nsea. Moreover, the down wash from the mountains themselves sometimes\r\nbuilds wide lands, which, as they extend and shut back the sea, leave\r\nthe mountains farther and farther away. Much of the land extending\r\neast from the base of the Rocky Mountains was made in this way. The\r\nMississippi Valley was for ages, you know (page 10) the Mediterranean\r\nSea of North America, lying in the downward fold of our continent\r\nbetween the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From the painting by David James_\r\n\r\nTHE WAVE]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY SEA WAVES RISE TO GREET THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest, most poetic phases of the relation between the\r\ngreat blue mountains and the great blue sea is that waves, as they\r\napproach the shores of continents bordered by mountain ranges, rise\r\nhigher and higher; and the higher the mountains, the higher rise the\r\nwaves. These waves are not driven by wind or tide but seem drawn\r\nforward by some strange power. This power, however, is no stranger\r\nthan the one that makes us fall and bump our noses when we stub our\r\ntoes--the power of gravitation, according to which all masses attract\r\neach other. It is the mass in the mountains that exerts a pull on the\r\nwaves; and the greater the mountains the greater the pull, of course.\r\nIn the Indian Ocean, for example, around the head of the Arabian Sea,\r\nthe waves rise far above sea level, largely because there is beyond\r\nthem, on the land, one of the greatest mountain masses in the world.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it give you a queer feeling if you were, say, a sailor, and\r\nfor the first time saw waves act like that? Uncanny, almost, isn't it?\r\n\r\nBut do the mountains remember their old parent of the white flowing\r\nrocks and beard, Father Neptune? They act as if they did; particularly\r\nin the way in which they come to imitate, in time, the shape of the\r\nwaves of the sea.\r\n\r\nRuskin,[21] speaking to artists about drawing mountains, says:\r\n\r\n\"Good and intelligent mountain drawing recognizes a great harmony among\r\nthe summits and their tendency to throw themselves into waves, closely\r\nresembling those of the sea itself; sometimes in free tossing toward\r\nthe sky, but more frequently in the form of breakers, concave and steep\r\non one side, convex and less steep on the other.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: \"Modern Painters,\" Chapter IV.]\r\n\r\nWhen you stand some day on one of the high peaks of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and look out over the great fields of upheaved stone,\r\nyou will notice how closely the parallel ridges resemble ranks of\r\nwaves making toward a shore. Like sea waves also, the vast backs of\r\nthese waves of stone are long and sloping, while their fronts are\r\ncomparatively short and much steeper. Another thing that makes you feel\r\nas if you were looking out upon a sea whose waves had been changed to\r\nstone is the fact that these stone waves are not only green but have\r\nwhite caps; for in the valleys, and far up the sides of the mountains,\r\nare the forests with the perennial green of their pines, and on the\r\npeaks the eternal snows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"AND EVERY TOSSING OF THEIR BOUNDLESS CRESTS\"]\r\n\r\nNot only is the mounting and forward drive of waves repeated in\r\nmountain forms, but also the whirlpools among the rocks when sea waves\r\nreach the shore. Says the famous French geographer, Reclus[22]:\r\n\r\n\"The centre of the Pyrenees resembles a great whirlpool around which\r\nthe mountains rise like enormous waves.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: \"The Earth.\"]\r\n\r\nFinally we might imagine that the mountains, like the mountain streams,\r\nhear the call of the sea and are stirred by it. For, again to quote\r\nfrom Ruskin's wonderful chapter on the nature of the thing we call a\r\nmountain:\r\n\r\n\"Behold as we look farther into it, it is all touched and troubled.\r\nThe rock trembles through its every fibre, like the chords of an\r\nÆolian harp--like the stillest air of spring with the echoes of a\r\nchild's voice. Into the heart of all those great mountains and through\r\nevery tossing of their boundless crests and deep beneath all their\r\nunfathomable defiles, flows that strange quivering of their substance.\r\n\r\n\"'I beheld the mountains and lo they trembled; and all the hills moved\r\nlightly.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From Norton's \"Elements of Geology.\"\r\n   By permission of Ginn and Company_\r\n\r\n              \"THAT STRANGE QUIVERING OF THEIR SUBSTANCE\"\r\n\r\n  This picture shows mountain-peaks carved in folded strata in the\r\n  Rocky Mountains in Montana. How well it illustrates Ruskin's grand\r\n  lines.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  Of course you saw that the Greeks meant the story of Phaeton to\r\n  account, among other things, for the origin of deserts, but what is\r\n  there in it that would lead one to believe the Greeks knew there\r\n  were such things as volcanoes? Read what the encyclopedia says\r\n  about volcanoes and Vulcan and the physical geography of Greece and\r\n  the Greek islands.\r\n\r\n  Where is Mount Stromboli and why is it called \"The Lighthouse of\r\n  the Mediterranean\"?\r\n\r\n  On which of our coasts do we have young and growing mountains, and\r\n  on which old mountains that are much worn down?\r\n\r\n  Did you ever notice, on your map of Europe, how the curve of\r\n  the Carpathian Mountains follows the curve of the shore of the\r\n  beautiful Adriatic Sea so far away?[23] What does that remind you\r\n  of in the story of the relation between the mountains and the sea?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: How far away is it? The scale of miles on your map will\r\ntell.]\r\n\r\n  \"Yes,\" you say, \"but if mountains are formed on the borders of the\r\n  sea why are the Carpathians so far from the Adriatic; and the Alps\r\n  so far from the Mediterranean and the Rocky Mountains of America\r\n  and the Altai mountains of Asia so far away from any sea at all?\"\r\n\r\n  Professor Heilprin[24] knew you would say that; at least I suppose\r\n  he did, for he has explained all this in his little book, written\r\n  especially for young people, \"The Earth and Its Story.\" After you\r\n  have read this part of the story write it out in your own words and\r\n  then copy it into your notebook. You might call your own story,\r\n  \"How Mountains are Moved Back from the Sea.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Professor of Geology in the Academy of Natural Sciences,\r\nPhiladelphia.]\r\n\r\n  What mountains do the waves of the Indian Ocean rise to salute? How\r\n  do they compare in size with other mountains that you know of?\r\n\r\n  How does the carbon in the gases of volcanoes get into the plants?\r\n\r\n  What does it say in Proverbs 6:6 that might remind one of the fact\r\n  that the ants helped solve the puzzle as to how volcanoes are made?\r\n\r\n  As to the hills that were moved in, a Wisconsin writer, who has,\r\n  among other things, written delightfully of his companionship with\r\n  the rocks and hills of his State[25] tells about sinking a well 132\r\n  feet deep on his farm, and going through this imported scenery all\r\n  the way.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Charles D Stewart, \"Essays on the Spot.\"]\r\n\r\n  \"Somewhere down there,\" he says, \"if I had kept on going I should\r\n  have struck the original Wisconsin.\"\r\n\r\n  And why not be an author yourself? Start a little book of science\r\n  of your own and learn to make notes on interesting things you\r\n  have been reading about. For instance, put in it now some of the\r\n  different things we have learned about the wonder-workers of the\r\n  Ice Age, up to and including this chapter. Call what you write \"The\r\n  Story of the Old Men of the Mountain.\" At the end of the part you\r\n  write now you can put \"To be continued,\" just as they do in a story\r\n  paper; for we are not through with the work of the old men, as you\r\n  will see.\r\n\r\n  How did Rome get its seven hills? (You know it was called The City\r\n  of the Seven Hills.)\r\n\r\n  The Bible quotation in Ruskin about the trembling of the mountains\r\n  is from Jeremiah 4:24. How grand it sounds, doesn't it? Like the\r\n  music of a pipe organ. The Bible has many references to \"hills\" and\r\n  mountains. Here are some of the most striking: Psalms 114:4; Exodus\r\n  20:18; Deut. 5:23; Rev. 8:8; Micah 1:4; Isaiah 54:10.\r\n\r\n  Where are the most famous of the Bad Lands of our Western States?\r\n  Those of South Dakota are perhaps the strangest. Among other\r\n  strange things is the fact that some of the hills were set on fire\r\n  by rain--goodness knows how long ago--and these hills are like\r\n  gigantic stoves for the cattle, who never fail to collect around\r\n  them on bleak days.\r\n\r\n  In the article on South Dakota in the Britannica you'll learn all\r\n  about how the rain started the fire. Then perhaps you will want to\r\n  look up \"spontaneous combustion\" and \"iron pyrites.\"\r\n\r\n  Aren't those ancient monsters whose bones they find in the hills\r\n  comical looking creatures--now that we are several million years\r\n  safely away from them? The comic artists (of pen and pencil) are\r\n  always having fun with them. Arthur Guiterman, for instance, in\r\n  picturing what spring must have been like in those old days:\r\n\r\n    \"Go-dum, bally hoosh!\" is the note of the Icthyosaurus.\r\n      \"Notorum-dorando!\" the blithe Hippocampus replies.\r\n    \"Chin-chin-orizaba-pelote!\" rings the jubilant chorus\r\n      Of sweet Pterodactyls that wing the cerulean skies.[26]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: \"The Laughing Muse.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON A NEW ENGLAND HILL\r\n\r\n    \"Great lumps of pudding the giants threw,\r\n     They tumbled about like rain.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                                (JULY)\r\n\r\n    They flung them over to Roxbury Hills;\r\n    They flung them over the plain;\r\n    And all over Milton and Dorchester too\r\n    Great lumps from the pudding the giants threw.\r\n    They tumbled about like rain.\r\n\r\n                                        --_The Ballad of the Boulders._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STONES OF THE FIELD\r\n\r\nIn our rambles during the summer vacation season we are constantly\r\ncoming across boulders; in the mountains, in the fields and by the sea.\r\nIn the mountains and near rocky headlands or at the foot of the cliffs\r\nwe take them for granted; they have evidently fallen from the rock\r\nwalls above them. But haven't you often wondered how they got out on\r\nthe prairies far from any rock masses? This chapter tells about that\r\nand other curious things in the lives of the great Boulder family.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Big Chief Boulder\r\n\r\nEven the Indians who, in those early days, had never gone to school or\r\nstudied geography, used to wonder how these big stones had travelled to\r\nthe places where they found them.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time the Indians in the wilds of Minnesota found an\r\nunusually big granite boulder lying among the hills. So what did they\r\ndo but paint a head with eagle feathers on one end of the stone. Then\r\nthey put stripes around its body. You see they thought of Mr. Boulder\r\nas a big chief in feathered head-dress and painted for war.\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDER THE BEGINNING OF KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\nIt may seem foolish to make all this fuss about finding a big stone\r\nin a field. But these ignorant red men were much wiser than we are if\r\nwe don't wonder about it too. Wonder is the beginning of knowledge;\r\nand the Indians thus took the first step toward one of the great\r\ndiscoveries of geology.\r\n\r\nIt was just such wondering on the part of scientific men that led to\r\ntheir finding out not only how these big stones got into strange lands\r\nbut how certain kinds of hills that we have just been reading about\r\nwere made. For, as you must have already guessed, the moving of these\r\nboulders was one of the many jobs Mr. Glacier did for us during the\r\nIce Age. But pretend you don't know the answer. It took the wise men a\r\nlong time to find it and that's where the fun comes in--in the hide and\r\nseek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From a photograph by Bourne & Shepherd, Calcutta_\r\n\r\n                  THE STRANGE OLD INDIAN OF MOUNT ABU\r\n\r\n  If those Minnesota Indians thought a boulder of the usual shape\r\n  was some big chief from another land, what would they have thought\r\n  if they had set eyes on this solemn old creature? He sits by the\r\n  hour--like Socrates in the market-place--and has sat for ages\r\n  gazing down at his image in a lake at the foot of Mount Abu in\r\n  India. He was carved into that shape by sands blown from the North\r\n  Indian desert acting on the softer parts of the rock. Most Indians,\r\n  as you know, are silent people, but this old chap, so I hear, never\r\n  speaks at all!\r\n\r\n  Yet some day he may, all of a sudden, take a jump! Boulders do that\r\n  sometimes, as you will see before you have finished this chapter.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE NORTH END OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\nSome of the boulders seem to have belonged to Alpine Clubs, for you\r\nfind them away up on mountain sides; some of them as high as 6,000\r\nfeet--that's over a mile you know--above the level of the sea. And\r\noften these boulders are not of the same material as the huge pieces\r\nof broken rock that fall from the neighboring mountain walls. Moreover\r\nthe blocks of stone from the mountain are angular; they are not nicely\r\nrounded off as are boulders and pebbles. It's that way all over the\r\nnorth end of the world as far south as the Ohio in this country and the\r\nAlps in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOULDN'T IT MAKE YOU NERVOUS, TOO?\r\n\r\n  This picture is from a story about a little boy who had to cross\r\n  a field full of big, dark boulders like this at night, and how\r\n  nervous it made him.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut there's one place in which you never will find boulders, and that's\r\nin a country where there are caves of any considerable size. Neither\r\nwill you find such caves where there are boulders.\r\n\r\nWhy shouldn't the caves and the boulders live happily together just\r\nlike other people? The answer is simple. The glaciers of the Ice Age,\r\nwith their enormous weight, crushed in the roofs of caves in every\r\nregion over which they flowed; and it was these same glaciers that left\r\nthe boulders. Since the glaciers went away the underground rivers that\r\nhollow out the caves have not had time to make new ones. It takes ages\r\nand ages to make a nice big cave.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Train of Thought\r\n\r\nThese widely scattered boulders furnished the students of the subject\r\nwith the very best evidence that there was once an Ice Age. First, the\r\ngeologists noticed, just as the Indians did, that the boulders were of\r\na different kind of rock from that of the regions in which they were\r\nfound. Up in Wisconsin, running southwest from Waterloo is a train (as\r\nit is called) of boulders sixty miles long. The boulders are of a very\r\nhard rock called quartzite, while all the rock deposits in that region\r\nare of limestone or sandstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. BOULDER ON HIS PERCH\r\n\r\n  This is what is called a \"perched boulder.\" Being a harder kind of\r\n  rock than that on which it was left by the glaciers, it has held\r\n  out against the winds and weather, while the stone under it has\r\n  been worn away.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn eastern Wisconsin, along with these stones, have been found pieces\r\nof copper, although there are no copper deposits near by. To the\r\nnortheast of where the fragments of copper were found are the great\r\ncopper deposits of what is now Michigan, and from this region the\r\nglaciers brought the copper and scattered it about as they moved\r\nsouth and southwest. So these mysterious stones and other things kept\r\npointing toward the north, in a kind of dumb show.\r\n\r\nIn mountain rain storms you can see the torrents driving great stones\r\nbefore them, so one of the first theories about the stranded boulders\r\nwas that, at some time in the earth's history, there had been great\r\nfloods covering whole continents, sweeping away rocks from the\r\nmountains and carrying them here, there, and everywhere. That theory\r\nalso accounted for the rounded shape of the boulders, for if you have\r\na volume of water big enough and swift enough you can roll boulders\r\nwherever you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT A QUEER HOBBY-HORSE!\r\n\r\nBut why should the boulder trains all lead to the north? And how could\r\nwater carry boulders right across a deep mountain valley and pile them\r\nhigh up on the mountains on the other side? How could water perch one\r\nboulder on another or on a flat ledge of rock or on the summits of the\r\ncliffs? Boulders so perched are very common, and often they are so\r\nnicely balanced that a man can set them rocking; and sometimes a small\r\nboy can do it. Every young man who goes to Dartmouth College knows\r\nabout the rocking stone some half mile east of the college. In the town\r\nof Barre is a big boulder with a small boulder on its back, and the\r\nsmall boulder can be set rocking like a child's hobby-horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE MOUNTAIN TORRENTS HELP SHAPE THE BOULDERS]\r\n\r\nThe only thing that could handle boulders in this way, so it turned\r\nout, were the glaciers. By following up the boulders to their homes\r\nin the mountains they found on the backs of the glaciers of to-day\r\nstones just like those in our fields, and they found them thickly\r\nscattered over the ground where the glaciers melted back during the\r\nsummer months. The glaciers not only pick up boulders from the mountain\r\ntorrent beds, as they move along, but themselves pluck rocks from\r\nmountain sides. Huge blocks of rock, dislodged when water freezes in\r\nthe cracks of the mountain walls, also fall upon the glacier. It was\r\nthe boulders held underneath the ice that left their autographs, deep\r\ngrooves on the native bed-rock in the regions into which the glaciers\r\nof the Ice Age came.\r\n\r\nThese great ice rivers filled the mountain valleys, and reaching far\r\nup on the mountain sides carried boulders to those heights. Sometimes\r\nthe glacier left the stones standing on a narrow point on top of other\r\nrocks--so making the rocking stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THEY KNOW THE OLD MEN DID IT\r\n\r\n  Here is one of those heaps of boulders, pebbles, and soil that the\r\n  glaciers of the Ice Age brought and left behind them. They know\r\n  those ancient glaciers did this, because just such heaps are found\r\n  under the edges of glaciers to-day.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Leaves from the Family Records of the Boulders\r\n\r\nWhat I have said so far of the Boulders is mainly about their travels\r\ninto foreign lands and how they were received by intellectual people.\r\nBut there are many other interesting things to be found in their\r\nfamily records that you will want to know about, I am sure.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE BOULDERS RODE ON THE WATER\r\n\r\nOne of these is how they came to ride on the water, when I said just\r\na little while back that only _ice_ could carry them across mountain\r\nvalleys, and pile them up on the mountain sides. That was all true;\r\nyet, under certain circumstances, boulders _have_ ridden on the water.\r\nAs the glaciers melted away finally in those early days the water, as\r\nyou know, helped make rivers and lakes. Then, from the front of the\r\nglaciers icebergs broke off and floated away down the rivers or across\r\nthe lakes. In these icebergs boulders were often imbedded, and so were\r\ndropped wherever the iceberg carried them before it dissolved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE BOULDERS RODE ON THE WATER\r\n\r\n  This is a scene in August in Glacier National Park. It illustrates\r\n  how boulders of the Ice Age travelled by water, when icebergs\r\n  containing them broke from the glaciers and floated away on rivers\r\n  and lakes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIce helps handle boulders in still another way; but before I tell you\r\nwhat it is I want you to imagine you are an Indian, away back in the\r\ndays before Indian schools, and see if you wouldn't be as superstitious\r\nas they were. Just suppose then that you are a red child of the forest,\r\nand that along a certain lake you saw near the shore a lot of boulders\r\nscattered about in a disorderly way. This, say, was in the fall. But\r\nwhen you came back the following spring you found them all piled up\r\ninto a wall along the lake, and you positively knew no member of your\r\ntribe or of any other had done the piling. Wouldn't it make you feel a\r\nlittle superstitious?\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MR. WINTER BUILDS BOULDER WALLS\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Winter that built these walls. With the spring break-up on\r\nlake shores big cakes of ice, blown by stiff gales, pry up the boulders\r\nalong shore, and force them further up the bank. Then another gale\r\nand another push, and more stones are crowded up on top of the first\r\ncourse, and so there is built a rude wall. Some of the stones may be\r\ncrowded together side by side. This makes what is called a \"boulder\r\npavement.\" But even this isn't all of nature's engineering in the\r\nhandling of boulders. Here is another example. Ice is formed on lakes\r\nearly in the winter when the air is but little below the freezing point\r\nof water. Under these circumstances ice expands. Then, with the first\r\nsevere cold spell it contracts and so cracks. Water, rising from below,\r\nfills these cracks, and is itself, in turn, frozen to ice. Then comes\r\na warm wave, these ice wedges swell, and so the ice sheet expands,\r\npushes up along the shore and, if there are any boulders there moves\r\nthem about; or sometimes drives them deep into the bank so that the\r\nfollowing spring it looks as if somebody had been shooting at the bank,\r\nusing boulders for bullets.\r\n\r\nThe sun shapes boulders somewhat as the blacksmith shapes iron, but\r\ninstead of striking with a hammer it strikes with its rays. Rock is\r\na poor conductor of heat, so the heat from the sun only goes into\r\nthe rock a little way. The result is that the surface expands and so\r\nloosens itself from the rock beneath and in course of time falls off.\r\nWith the cooling of the atmosphere at night just the opposite thing\r\ntakes place; the surface cools off first and so, contracting, loosens\r\nitself from the body of the stone. It seems to be a regular tug of war\r\nbetween the heat of the day and the cool of the night. First of all the\r\ncorners and sharp edges break away because, being thinner, they are\r\nheated and cooled more quickly. The boulders owe their rounded shapes\r\nmost of all, however, to the fact that they were ground together in the\r\nbody of the glaciers as those great ice sheets flowed along.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD TALKS BY LEARNED BOULDERS\r\n\r\nOf course, the boulders, like other people, differ in their tastes--as\r\nyou can tell by their talk. The granite boulders have the most to\r\nsay about travel because they are so hard that they can take longer\r\njourneys than weaker rocks, and so have more to tell. But there is\r\nanother branch of the family that is still more \"bookish\" as you may\r\nsay. These are the \"pudding stone\" boulders--conglomerates. In that\r\nmost interesting biography, \"The Story of a Boulder,\" Professor Geikie\r\ndescribes a stone that was not only made up of a variety of pebbles,\r\nbut in which there was a section of sandstone. The sandstone and the\r\nconglomerate had been neighbors in some rock ledge just as the pebble\r\nsection and the smooth sand section are always neighbors where the\r\nshores descend into the sea. So when the rock mass, which was finally\r\nrounded into a boulder, broke away it included portions of both\r\nsandstone and conglomerate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE THE SEA HELPS SHAPE THE BOULDERS]\r\n\r\nThe upper part of this boulder--the sandstone--had in it stems and\r\nleaflets of plants of the Coal Age, changed to coal. The pebbles below\r\nwere fragments of more ancient rocks made at a time when frogs as big\r\nas the oxen of to-day lived in the marshes.\r\n\r\n\"They must have had a croak like a fog-horn,\" said the High School Boy.\r\n\r\nIn this story of the boulder, Professor Geikie says:\r\n\r\n\"I had here a quaint old black letter volume of the Middle Ages giving\r\nan account of the events taking place at the time it was written and\r\ncontaining in its earlier pages numerous quotations from the authors of\r\nantiquity.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHICH DO YOU SAY?]\r\n\r\nThe \"quotations from the authors of antiquity,\" were the pebbles, of\r\ncourse, once parts of older rocks.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the boulders as authors. You will also be interested\r\nin their relations with artists. Boulders add much to the picturesque\r\neffect of the shores of lakes and seas and mountain ravines, as they\r\nappear to the traveller, and as artists reproduce them in pictures.\r\nThey also add to the beauty of streams, by forming rapids. These\r\nboulders that are piled in so thick as to make rapids are brought\r\nin by smaller but swifter tributaries that flow into larger but more\r\nsluggish streams. Rapids are favorite topics for landscape artists.\r\nThey are characteristic of the work of Ruysdael, for example, with whom\r\nyou have become well acquainted in your picture studies in school.\r\n\r\nOf the drawing of stones in general Ruskin says:\r\n\r\n\"There are no natural objects out of which an artist, or any one who\r\nappreciates the form of things, can learn more than out of stones. A\r\nstone is a mountain in miniature. The fineness of Nature's work is\r\nso great that into a single block a foot or two in diameter she can\r\ncompass as many changes of form and structure on a small scale as she\r\nneeds for her mountains on a large one, using moss for forests and\r\ngrains of crystal for crags.\"[27]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: \"Modern Painters.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHY BOULDERS SOMETIMES TAKE A JUMP\r\n\r\n  Boulders sometimes jump up, all of a sudden, as if they had sat\r\n  on a pin. They do this when an earthquake wave passes straight\r\n  through the globe; from Ecuador, say, to Borneo. Such waves, called\r\n  \"waves of transmission,\" travel \"incog\" as it were, not causing\r\n  any disturbance until they reach the surface again. Then if there\r\n  happens to be a big rock on the spot, up it jumps--the funniest\r\n  thing you ever saw!\r\n\r\n  Harry Furniss, the famous English cartoonist, made this picture\r\n  just for a joke.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn page 157 you will find two pictures of stones by two famous\r\nlandscape artists, Claude and Turner. Of the stones in one picture Mr.\r\nRuskin says, \"they are massy and ponderous as stones should be\"; while\r\nthe stones in the other picture are \"wholly without weight.\"\r\n\r\nIn which of the pictures would you say the stones are \"massy and\r\nponderous,\" and in which are they \"wholly without weight?\"\r\n\r\nNow look at the \"Hide and Seek\" notes below and see if you and Mr.\r\nRuskin think alike.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  A boy scout, as you know, is expected, among other things, to be an\r\n  Indian (a good Indian, of course); to keep his eyes wide open as he\r\n  goes about in the woods and fields. In that way he is always coming\r\n  across things to wonder over, such as the big stone the Indians\r\n  found.\r\n\r\n  It's just such boys that great men are made of. All the great\r\n  scientists began in that way.\r\n\r\n  Take the case of Hugh Miller, for example. In the encyclopedias you\r\n  will meet him as a famous geologist, along with great artists and\r\n  inventors and statesmen and other fine company; but at first he was\r\n  only a boy, like the rest of us. And he had very little chance to\r\n  go to school, but he went anyhow; went to school, like Lincoln, to\r\n  all the good books he could get hold of and also to the stones of\r\n  the field. After a while he got so he could write books himself,\r\n  and they are among the most readable books you ever saw. You just\r\n  read his story of \"The Old Red Sandstone,\" and if you don't open\r\n  your eyes!\r\n\r\n  The encyclopedia will tell you a great deal about the boy himself\r\n  and about \"Uncle Sandy\" and \"Uncle James,\" and how they helped him.\r\n  But the start of it was this:\r\n\r\n  One day a mason in Scotland[28] broke off a piece of stone--he was\r\n  building a wall at the time--and inside of the stone he found--what\r\n  do you think? A fish! Inside of the stone, mind you!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Hugh was a Scotch boy.]\r\n\r\n  Of course you won't be surprised to hear that it was a queer,\r\n  outlandish sort of fish, and that it was dead. In fact, it had been\r\n  dead so long that it also had turned to stone. In short, it was a\r\n  fossil. But no Pharaoh in his huge pyramid ever became more famous\r\n  than did that little fish in his tomb of stone.\r\n\r\n  Yet, would you believe it?--neither the mason nor his fellow\r\n  workmen thought much about it. They frequently came upon these\r\n  fossils and, beyond being idly curious at first, paid little\r\n  attention to them.\r\n\r\n  This day, however, among these workmen was Hugh Miller, who was\r\n  also a stone-mason by trade. Hugh got as excited over this fish as\r\n  a boy. (He was only seventeen at the time, I believe.)\r\n\r\n  \"The story of this queer fish,\" he said to himself, \"must be as\r\n  good as Sinbad the Sailor, and the Yellow Dwarf, and Jack the Giant\r\n  Killer, that I used to like so well when I was a little lad;\"[29]\r\n  and he determined to find out all he could about it. He found from\r\n  the geology books that there was much yet to be learned about such\r\n  fish, and so he proceeded to study the stones. He opened the stones\r\n  with his hammer as you open a book. He put in all his leisure time\r\n  at this work, with the result that he not only became one of the\r\n  world's famous geologists, but he wrote books in which he made it\r\n  a point to tell these curious stories of ancient life in the sea,\r\n  so that people without any previous scientific knowledge could read\r\n  and enjoy them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: He had read all these stories and a lot more, so my old\r\nChambers' Encyclopedia says.]\r\n\r\n  Besides \"The Old Red Sandstone\" he wrote \"Footprints of the\r\n  Creator,\" \"The Testimony of the Rocks,\" \"My Schools and School\r\n  Masters,\" \"Scenes and Legends of the North of Scotland,\" and a\r\n  book of poems. Not all the conclusions he came to are accepted\r\n  to-day--for geology, like all the sciences, is always growing--but\r\n  the history of its growth and how men reasoned things out is quite\r\n  as interesting and profitable as the facts themselves, and Hugh\r\n  Miller has a particularly attractive way of telling things.\r\n\r\n  So you see those Indians who painted up old Big Chief Boulder were\r\n  on the right track; they were deeply interested in it and its being\r\n  there as a great and mysterious work of nature. They named it\r\n  \"Waukon,\" an Indian word meaning \"mystery.\"\r\n\r\n  Oh, yes, and about boulders in art, it's the stone in the upper of\r\n  the two pictures that Ruskin considers \"massy and ponderous\" and\r\n  hence true to nature. Turner painted it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                               (AUGUST)\r\n\r\n    In the parching August wind\r\n    Cornfields bow the head.\r\n\r\n                                             --_Christina G. Rossetti._\r\n\r\n    Over the sea-like, pathless,\r\n    Limitless waste of the desert.\r\n\r\n                                                        --_Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESERT\r\n\r\nAugust is usually such a hot, dry month that it ought to be a good time\r\nfor talking of deserts. We can realize better what a desert is and\r\nwhat an interesting region it must be to those who spend their lives\r\nthere--the Arabs and the camels, for instance. In fact, there are so\r\nmany strange and striking things to be seen and learned in deserts that\r\nwhole books--including many stories--have been written about them, and\r\nI'm sorry we can give the subject only one chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Face of the Desert\r\n\r\nI sometimes think it was no wonder the old Sphinx got to asking\r\nconundrums. Always looking toward the desert and its mysteries, how\r\ncould he help it? The desert is just full of conundrums. For instance:\r\n\r\nWhere is it that rains fall without reaching the earth?\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From the painting by Elihu Vedder_\r\n\r\n                     THE QUESTIONER OF THE SPHINX\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhere is it that there are lake beds without lakes, river beds without\r\nrivers, and rivers without mouths?\r\n\r\nWhere do you see stretches of water that aren't there, and men and\r\nanimals walking and trees growing--most of them upside down?\r\n\r\nWhere are the roses of the land and the waves of great inland seas made\r\nof sand and where does the wind always blow the mountains away?\r\n\r\nOf course you would probably give the right answer at once--\"the\r\ndesert\"--because you know I am talking about deserts. And the \"water\r\nthat isn't there,\" and the trees and people and things that are upside\r\ndown--you probably know that's the mirage; and that the inland seas\r\nwith their waves of sand are the dunes; that the rivers without mouths\r\nare those that, like the Tajunga in California, lose their waters in\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\nMost people who have gone to school know all these things. Most people\r\nalso think of the desert as just a sea of sand and all tawny, like a\r\nlion's skin; but this is wrong. The Romans used to call the African\r\ndesert \"the panther's skin,\" because of the tawny stretches spotted\r\nwith the dark palms of the oases, but the sands are not all tawny, and\r\nthe desert isn't all covered with sand.\r\n\r\nIf we could arrange to get on the back of any one of the great birds of\r\nthe Sahara--say an eagle or his big cousin the vulture--and sail with\r\nhim on his way to dinner, the scenery would unroll beneath us something\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\nOn the northern border the Atlas Mountains, with precipices of wild\r\nbeauty and ranges of bare, pink rock outlined against the blue of\r\nthe morning sky; then dune waves stretching for miles and miles with\r\nvalleys between them, so wide that it takes the camels from breakfast\r\ntime until noon to lumber their way across. The crests of some of these\r\ndune waves go spinning off in spray with every freshening breeze.\r\nLittle dunes often dissolve away in the wind as the caravan moves\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAUNT OUTLINES OF THE HUNGRY HILLS\r\n\r\nThen we come to more mountain ranges running right across the desert's\r\nface, their bare rocks shivered and shelving down into broken fragments\r\nat their feet; then sharp-edged, jagged hills--not rounded, plump,\r\nand well-fed hills, such as we have at home. They are the bones of the\r\nhungry landscape showing through. Then we come to bare table-lands and\r\nthe empty beds of rivers and lakes that long ago went dry; valleys\r\nscattered with boulders of all sizes and in every imaginable position;\r\nand so on over into the Arabian desert, with its flats of white sand\r\nclosed in by high cliffs, and vast stretches of black and red gravel.\r\nMore of the sand and gravel of the desert is red than yellow; but some\r\nof it is white and some of it is black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OASIS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DARK HILLS AND THE FIGURES IN WHITE\r\n\r\n  \"The Baths of the Damned,\" the superstitious Arabs call the region\r\n  of the Northern Sahara in which you come upon these strange white\r\n  figures. The fearsome name was suggested by the fact that the\r\n  figures slowly rise from some hot region inside the earth. In\r\n  reality they are mounds of carbonate of lime deposited by the water\r\n  of hot springs heavily charged with dissolved limestone. Similar\r\n  springs in our Yellowstone Park spout up in the form of geysers\r\n  and form \"geyser basins\"--huge stone tubs. Here in the desert the\r\n  water doesn't spout; it bubbles up slowly and so builds the mounds.\r\n  In the background you see black masses of volcanic rock, for this,\r\n  like Yellowstone Park, is a volcanic region where the underground\r\n  rocks haven't cooled off.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAOS OF COLOR IN THE ROCKS\r\n\r\nThe desert wears rocks and stones of as many colors as the jewels of\r\nOriental kings. It also runs much to solemn black in its heaps of\r\nvolcanic rock with cold limestones on the heights; but you can see\r\nblue-grays, browns, ochres of every shade gleaming in the sun, the reds\r\nof the rusting iron in them staining the precipices and the walls; and\r\nthere are purples and pinks and dark greens and violets. These colored\r\nrocks are often fantastically mixed together, like the colors on an\r\nEaster egg.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SKELETONS OF THE DEAD RIVERS\r\n\r\nAnd here we come upon one of those skeletons of dead rivers that I\r\nspoke about. There they are, the river valleys and the river beds,\r\nfull of sand and gravel, and with boulders along the banks, and branch\r\nvalleys running into them; a river system all complete but for one\r\nthing--water. It's just as if the main valley and the branches had been\r\nmade all ready but the river never came; or as if there had been rivers\r\nthere once but they couldn't stand the climate! Of course, when a\r\ncloudburst comes along it helps itself to these ready-made river-beds;\r\nbut for the most part they stand as empty as the ruins on the desert's\r\nedge in which\r\n\r\n                    ... the lion and the lizard keep\r\n    The courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep.[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: \"The Rubaiyat\" of Omar Khayyam.]\r\n\r\nNot only do the size of the river-beds show that there used to be more\r\nfrequent rains in these regions of desolation, but right at the edge of\r\nthe northern Sahara are the remains of immense aqueducts; great troughs\r\nbuilt of stone and carried on bridges from the source of a water supply\r\nto a city. When the Romans owned the earth--including the Sahara\r\ndesert--they were famous builders of these aqueducts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHY DYING RIVERS MULTIPLY BY TWO\r\n\r\n  Director Hornaday, of the New York Zoo, took this picture while\r\n  in the arid regions of the great Southwest. It shows a little\r\n  stream dying away in the desert sands. Now just notice how a little\r\n  knowledge of nature's methods as a landscape artist makes the most\r\n  commonplace scenery interesting. All streams as they go dry have\r\n  a tendency to spread out arms like that; sometimes two, sometimes\r\n  four or more, but always in twos or multiples of two. The reason\r\n  is that as the water evaporates the stream becomes weaker and so\r\n  is obliged to drop a part of its load. The heaviest part of the\r\n  load--the most pebbles, sand, and soil--is carried in the middle of\r\n  the stream, owing to the current being stronger, relieved as it is\r\n  from the friction of the banks. So bars of sand, gravel, and such\r\n  stuff are built up that finally divide the water into two branches.\r\n  Then if the water keeps on flowing, each of these branches divides\r\n  by two, and so on. You see the same thing in the mouths of deltas.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\"But what about the roses made of sand? That's a conundrum you didn't\r\nanswer.\"\r\n\r\nOh, yes, we must get down closer to the desert to see these. We can't\r\nsee them in the bird's-eye view we have been taking. The desert sand\r\nhas a great deal of gypsum in it, and when the sand gets a wetting from\r\na cloudburst this gypsum crystallizes and forms what are called \"sand\r\nroses.\" These \"roses\" are of various sizes and forms; some look like\r\ncamelias and some like a cluster of pearls. They are not common and you\r\nhave to hunt for them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALL THE COMFORTS OF HOME\r\n\r\n  Children in the primary grades have here told us, with their clever\r\n  little fingers, about life in Africa immediately south of the big\r\n  desert, the part of Africa where they have rain and to spare.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. How the Desert Makes Its Sand\r\n\r\nMost of the sand of the desert, as you may imagine, is home-made; and\r\nit is very curious to notice the different which it is manufactured.\r\nThe desert sun and the cloudless nights have a great deal to do with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE ARAB FARMER GATHERS HIS DATES]\r\n\r\nThink of the hottest day in August you ever saw, and then multiply\r\nby two. That will give you an idea of how hot a desert gets in the\r\nday-time--something like 200 degrees; and 212 degrees boils eggs, you\r\nknow! But how cold do you suppose it gets at night? Fifteen minutes\r\nafter sunset the temperature drops to freezing. The reason of this is\r\nthat there are no clouds over the desert to keep the heat of the sand\r\nwastes and the burning rocks from passing off rapidly into space. The\r\ndays are so hot and the nights are so cold that the rocks get a kind of\r\nfever and ague, which makes them pull themselves to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"GOOSE-FLESH\" ON THE ROCKS\r\n\r\nIt is the same process we have just read about in the story of the\r\nstones of our fields, only it goes on much faster in the desert on\r\naccount of the more rapid changes of temperature. You know how your\r\nskin will pucker up into goose-flesh when you are cold. The desert\r\nrocks do something similar. Because rock is a poor conductor, the heat\r\nof the day and the cold of the night penetrate only a little way--only\r\nthrough the skin of the rock, as it were; so this skin, stretching in\r\nthe day-time and puckering up at night, becomes loosened and shells off\r\nbit by bit. Then it is blown about and in time ground into sand by the\r\ndesert winds.\r\n\r\nSome rocks have an additional way of getting picked to pieces. Granite\r\nis one of these. It has several different kinds of mineral in it, and\r\nsome of these minerals contract and expand faster than others; some\r\nmore than others. As a consequence, the particles of the rock keep\r\npulling and hauling at each other. This helps to break it up into\r\nlittle pieces, which soon become sand. The darker the rock, other\r\nthings being equal, the greater the changes, because anything dark--a\r\nsuit of clothes, for instance--absorbs heat faster than a light object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From Norton's \"Elements of Geology.\"\r\n   By permission of Ginn and Company_\r\n\r\n                  HOW RAIN-DROPS HELP SPLIT BOULDERS\r\n\r\n  A big boulder in western Texas split, just as you see it here, by\r\n  rain-drops, with the help of the sun, and under the conditions\r\n  described in the text, sat for this photograph. A friend of mine\r\n  who has been all over that country says that on blistering-hot\r\n  days you can see little pieces pop out of the granite boulders,\r\n  like chips from an invisible chisel struck by an invisible hammer.\r\n  This is why: We Granites are made up of particles--little bits--of\r\n  several different minerals, and some of these minerals expanding\r\n  much faster than others pop themselves out.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe great mountain rocks of the desert, bare of all protecting soil and\r\nverdure, are always crumbling as a result of all these causes, and so\r\nthe winds are constantly blowing them away, piece by piece.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LITTLE RAIN-DROPS SPLIT BIG BOULDERS\r\n\r\nAs if everything in the desert were in the sand-making business the\r\nvery rain-drops help make sand. The rain-drops do this in much the same\r\nway that the farmer breaks big boulders in his fields, so that he can\r\nmore easily haul them away, piece by piece. He builds a fire against\r\nthe boulder, gets it as hot as he can, then rakes the fire away, dashes\r\nwater on the stone, and--bang! It cracks as if old Thor had struck it\r\nwith his hammer.\r\n\r\nYou see why this is, don't you, after what we have been saying about\r\nwhy the rock's skin chips off? The water suddenly cools the highly\r\nheated rock, and the parts shrinking pull away from each other with a\r\nbang! bang! bang! The hot desert rocks, dashed by the torrents of a\r\ncloudburst, break apart just like that, and you can hear them. Stones\r\ntwenty-five feet across are often broken into many pieces after a\r\ndownpour. Then the finer pieces of rock that are made in this continual\r\nsplitting, and by the chipping that goes on day and night, the fierce\r\nwinds grind against each other; so manufacturing sand. And the fiercer\r\nwinds also drive coarse sand against crumbling rock surfaces, thus\r\ngrinding them away and making more sand. So the winds, using sand to\r\nmake sand, put the sand out at interest, you may say.\r\n\r\nAnd on all its sand, made in these various ways--by wind and rain and\r\nheat and cold, and the crystal fairies of the land of change--the\r\ndesert puts its special trade-mark, just as a manufacturer puts his\r\ntrade-mark on his goods. If you should take some desert sand and some\r\nsand from the shores of the sea and show them to a man who knows about\r\nsuch things, he would say (after he had put them under a microscope, of\r\ncourse):\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESERT'S TRADE-MARK ON ITS SANDS\r\n\r\n\"_This_ sand came from a desert, or from some place where it was much\r\nblown about by the winds; while _this_ sand is from the shores of the\r\nsea, or of a lake.\" The sand grains of the seashore, although they are\r\nalways being tumbled about by the waves, as the desert sands are by the\r\nwinds, are protected from each other by the water between them. These\r\nlittle water cushions prevent the sand grains from rubbing together;\r\nso they keep a good many of their sharp edges. They are not rounded\r\nlike the sands of the desert. The winds keep the desert sands grinding\r\nagainst each other, at the same time turning them over and over, so\r\nwearing them away pretty evenly on all sides. It also grinds them\r\nagainst the desert rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DESERT SIMOOM ON ITS TRAVELS\r\n\r\n  A traveller in the Sahara took this snap-shot of a simoom from\r\n  the outside and at a safe distance. You can see that it must be\r\n  quite a distance from where we are standing, for the trees in the\r\n  foreground are still. The vast cloud of sand looks quite dark\r\n  because of the shadows cast by the sun, which it hides from view.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is as if there were cut upon the sea sands, \"Father Neptune: His\r\nMake\"; while the genii of the desert, jealous for the desert's\r\nreputation, had engraved on their own product:\r\n\r\n\"Genuine Desert Sand. Look for the Trade-Mark and Accept No\r\nSubstitutes!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Plant People of the Desert\r\n\r\nAlthough it doesn't look a bit homey to us there are quite a few people\r\nliving in the desert, when you come to count them all--four-legged\r\npeople, and six-legged people, and two-legged people, and big and\r\nlittle people with wings, and the people of the plant world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER BOTTLE OF THE DESERT\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious of the plant people is the cactus, particularly\r\nthe one known as the \"desert water bottle.\" Like many two-legged people\r\nit has a rough, unsociable exterior, but a kind heart. Let a traveller\r\ncome upon one of these bristly cactuses, after long, thirsty hours,\r\nand he will realize what this means. Inside this cactus he will find\r\nwhat will seem to him the most delightful drink he ever tasted. While\r\nit isn't as cool as it might be, neither is it as warm as you would\r\nexpect, and it has a pleasant, sweet taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAWING WATER FROM THE BARREL CACTUS\r\n\r\n  This cactus, so far as shape is concerned, really belongs to the\r\n  barrel family, as you can see, besides performing one of the most\r\n  useful functions of a barrel in holding good drinking water for\r\n  thirsty travellers in the desert. My, how thirsty you get! You\r\n  drink, drink, drink from sunrise to sunset--about two gallons a\r\n  day. But sometimes the supply you are carrying gives out because\r\n  you miscalculated or you've lost your way, or the barrel leaks.\r\n  Then, oh, how you welcome the sight of a barrel cactus among the\r\n  rocky foot-hills! Director Hornaday, in the delightful book from\r\n  which I have already quoted says: \"You get a gallon of water\r\n  surprisingly cool, and in flavor like the finest raw turnip. The\r\n  object on the ground is not a circular saw, but the inverted top\r\n  of the cactus, and the whiteness is that of the white meat that\r\n  contains the water. With a stick the meat is pounded to a pulpy\r\n  mass, and the water oozes out, forming a little pool. Then the\r\n  man with the cleanest hands washes them cleaner with some of the\r\n  pulp--throwing _this_ pulp away, of course--then squeezes the water\r\n  out of the rest of it into the barrel.\"\r\n\r\n  Another interesting thing about this cactus is that it enables you\r\n  to get candy right in the desert; for here and there, through its\r\n  thick skin, it oozes out a secretion called \"cactus candy,\" which\r\n  is very delicious. You are always sorry there is so little of it.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe fact that you can get a drink in this way, just when you want it\r\nmost, all comes of foresight on the part of the cactus. After they get\r\ndown from two to four inches in the ground the roots of this cactus\r\nspread out in every direction and for a long way. They collect every\r\nbit of moisture in the soil, and they make the most of every drop of\r\nrain that falls within their reach. Then they hide all this moisture\r\naway and cling to every precious drop. Most plants, you know, evaporate\r\na great deal of water through their leaves. But the cactus, living in\r\na world where rains are few and far between, just can't afford to do\r\nany evaporating to speak of; so it has practically no leaves, you see,\r\nonly little bits of things that you almost have to take a microscope to\r\nfind. But what it lacks in leaves it makes up in spines, which defend\r\nit against the attacks of most thirsty animals, although it is believed\r\nthe desert mice know the secret of getting at this water, in spite of\r\nthe spines.\r\n\r\nOne kind of desert plant you have no doubt met face to face, for it is\r\nused to make printing paper. It grows in the deserts of Libya and other\r\nparts of North Africa, and is called esparto grass. Like hemp, it has\r\nstems which are full of strong fibres. These stems are gathered in huge\r\nbundles, which are carried by camels to the sea, where they are sent by\r\nship to the English paper mills.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE \"ROSE OF JERICHO\" GOES TO SEA\r\n\r\nBut there is a member of the desert plant family called the \"Rose of\r\nJericho,\" that doesn't wait for anybody to come after it and carry it\r\nto sea; it just picks up and sets sail for itself. It is a bush about\r\nsix inches high, a native of the wastes of Northern Africa, Palestine,\r\nand Arabia. It bears a little four-petaled flower. When blossom time is\r\nover the leaves fall off and its branches, loaded with seeds, dry up,\r\nand, curling inward as they dry, form a ball. Its roots also let go of\r\nthe soil, so that the strong desert winds easily pull it up and it goes\r\nbowling away toward the sea. When it gets there it tumbles in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CACTUS-WREN AND HER LITTLE FRONT DOOR\r\n\r\n  Speaking of cactus spines, do you know how many of those wicked\r\n  little spines the cactus-wren had to work with and tug and twist\r\n  about in building that nest? About two thousand! These spines not\r\n  only make the nest but defend it. You can't be too careful about\r\n  your front door in Desertland. Such neighbors!\r\n]\r\n\r\nThen this bold little traveller, who is very sensitive to moisture\r\nalthough he has had so little of it in his bringing up, promptly\r\nunfolds his arms and scatters his handful of seeds on the water; which\r\nis precisely the thing he took all that journey to do! For the seeds\r\nare carried far by the currents of the sea. Thus the family to which\r\nthis plant belongs keeps sending out colonies into new lands. This\r\nseems to be one of the chief missions in life of plants as of other\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nThe plant of which we have just been speaking is called the \"Rose of\r\nJericho,\" although it looks so little like a rose that quaint old John\r\nGerard, an English doctor who loved and studied plants over three\r\nhundred years ago, says:\r\n\r\n\"The coiner of the name spoiled it in the mint; for of all plants that\r\nhave been written of not any are more unlike unto the rose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIND WITCHES OF THE STEPPES\r\n\r\nOur own tumbleweeds and the Canada thistle have the same trick of\r\nbowling before the wind. There is a relative of these tumblers living\r\non the Russian steppes that the Cossacks call the \"wind witch.\" At\r\nthe end of the season the branches dry up into a ball and then by the\r\nhundreds these witches go skimming over the plains, driven by the loud\r\nautumn winds. They are as light as a feather, and they go so fast that\r\nsometimes even the Cossack horsemen cannot catch them, as they often\r\ntry to do in sport. Part of the time they move along with a short,\r\nquick, hopping motion, and then, caught by an eddy, rise a hundred feet\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\nOften dozens of them get locked together, join hands like the real\r\nwitches of our fairy tales, and the whole company goes dancing away\r\nbefore the howling blast.\r\n\r\nEery creatures!\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Autographs in the Sand\r\n\r\nThere are certain very interesting people of the desert that you\r\ndon't often find at home, not because they aren't there, but because\r\nthey don't _want_ to be found. Snakes, lizards, rabbits, and ground\r\nsquirrels slip quietly out of your way in the early morning, and by\r\nthe time the hot sun is high, beast and bird seek the shadows of the\r\ncanyons, or of big rocks, shelving banks, or caves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COYOTE'S NOCTURNE\r\n\r\n  In addition to what he tells so cleverly in the picture about the\r\n  night song of the Coyote, Dan Beard--_your_ Dan Beard of the Boy\r\n  Scouts--says the animal is a ventriloquist; can throw his voice so\r\n  that it sounds as if he were a mile off, then startle you with the\r\n  noise of a full pack at your heels--and all the time be sitting\r\n  watching you from behind a stone not fifty yards away!\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut they all leave word. In the lava beds of the Arizona desert, where\r\nnot even the cactus will grow, you can make out the tracks of the quail\r\nand the linnet, and of a peculiar desert bird called the road-runner.\r\nThere, also, are the tracks of the coyote and the wildcat, the gray\r\nwolf, and sometimes the mountain lion. If about daybreak you saw what\r\nseemed to be a long, lean, hungry dog, trotting away slantwise with a\r\ncautious eye to the rear, it was probably a gray wolf a little late in\r\ngetting home. Like the coyote, the wildcat, the owl, and many other\r\ndesert people, that old gray wolf belongs to the world's great night\r\nshift and is usually back in his mountain home by sunrise. Even when\r\nyou see him at all--which is seldom--he is hard to make out; for, like\r\nthe coyote, he wears a rusty, sunburned coat, which blends with the\r\nsand and the yellow rocks.\r\n\r\nThe coyote is a smaller member of the wolf family, to which both the\r\ndog and the fox belong. He has much of the same cunning, and like Br'er\r\nFox is fond of chicken. But his home is usually so far from modern\r\nconveniences he has few chances to visit poultry yards, and lives from\r\npaw to mouth, as it were, catching a jack-rabbit when he can--the\r\ndesert rabbits seem to sleep with both eyes open--and lizards when he\r\ncan't get rabbits. At the worst he will make out on \"prickly pears,\"\r\nthe pods of the mesquite bush, which are full of seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINGED PEOPLE OF THE DESERT\r\n\r\nAlthough you will not realize it at first there are a good many birds\r\nin the desert. Some are transients, just passing through, and stopping\r\nfor a rest and a bite or two on the way. Others, such as the linnet\r\nand the wrens, have nests tucked away among the spines of the cactus,\r\nand there's a finch singing from the top of that bush! In flower\r\ntime in the Arizona desert (of which we are now speaking) there are\r\nhumming-birds, but their colors are not so bright as those of our\r\nhumming-birds. Feathers, like hair, have the natural color burned out\r\nof them in the desert sun. Only the insects keep their bright clothes.\r\nTurn over a stone and away will scamper golden beetles, silver beetles,\r\nturquoise blue beetles, beetles in bronze; a whole boxful of jewels on\r\nsix legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From McCook's \"Nature's Craftsmen.\"\r\n   Copyright Harper and Brothers_\r\n\r\n                    THE LIFE STRUGGLE IN THE DESERT\r\n\r\n  The late Harry Fenn, who did everything so well, drew this picture\r\n  of one of the incidents of the life struggle in the desert. It\r\n  represents the desert wasp, known as the \"tarantula killer,\"\r\n  pursuing its prey. The tarantula of the Southwest is the giant\r\n  among our native spiders, but it cowers before the wasp, and\r\n  hurries off as fast as it can; but usually it _can't_, and is soon\r\n  laid away in Lady Wasp's nest as food for her solitary baby when\r\n  it comes out of the egg which the mother wasp lays in the spider's\r\n  body.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS, LIZARDS, SPIDERS, AND OTHERS\r\n\r\nAnd there are gray lizards, yellow lizards, and lizards called\r\n\"skinks,\" with tails as blue as indigo; and the gila monster, a lizard\r\nin dull orange and black, with an ugly disposition and poison in his\r\nlower jaw. Another big lizard of the Arizona desert is called the\r\nchuckwalla. The Arizona Indians are very fond of him. They say he\r\ntastes like chicken.\r\n\r\nMost of the spider family are represented in Arizona, including the\r\ntrap-door spider, who hides and waits for his dinner in a hole with\r\na wonderful trap-door that he made himself. This door he slams tight\r\nwhen he gets you inside, if you're a fly or anything like that. He\r\nalso shuts this door in the face of his enemy, the centipede, a flat\r\nworm a foot long, with loads of legs and feet. His name means \"hundred\r\nfooted.\" He has poison daggers in his feet and his two-branched tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DESERT BEETLE AND HIS GYMNASTICS\r\n\r\n  This desert beetle is called by the Indians\r\n  \"The-Bug-that-Stands-on-His-Head.\" At first I thought he was taking\r\n  stomach exercises, for beetles have wonderful digestions, as you\r\n  may learn from Fabre's book on \"The Sacred Beetle.\" But Mr. Howard,\r\n  Chief of the Bureau of Entomology at Washington--Uncle Sam's great\r\n  authority on bugs--tells me this is an attitude many beetles take\r\n  on the approach of an enemy, the object being to discharge a kind\r\n  of poison-gas which is intended to drive him away; and usually does.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT A WONDERFUL FLYING MACHINE HE IS!\r\n\r\nBut what's that away up in the sky? A flying machine? Yes, one of the\r\nmost wonderful flying-machines in the world--a vulture. There he goes,\r\nsweeping in wide circles, as he hunts along the mountain range, mile\r\nafter mile, closely scanning the base of the cliffs for the bodies of\r\nunfortunate creatures that have fallen over. Vultures will keep in the\r\nair in that way whole days at a time, following the cliffs and canyons\r\nfor hundreds of miles. But for all that it is sometimes a week or two\r\nbetween meals with a desert vulture.\r\n\r\nHow does the vulture soar so wonderfully? Nobody is quite sure about\r\nit. Often for hours there is no motion of the wings, as far as anybody\r\nhas been able to make out, and a soaring vulture seems to be able to\r\nmove as easily against the wind as with it. You'll not be surprised\r\nto hear that it takes time to learn to fly like that--a whole year.\r\nAnd even after the first year the young vultures stay for a good while\r\nunder the instruction of their parents, going out hunting with them\r\nevery day and sleeping with them in the nest on the cliffs at night.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. A Day in the Sahara\r\n\r\nHow would you like to spend a day in the famous Sahara desert with the\r\ncamels and the people and the dogs; and, I was going to say, the flies?\r\nBut the flies can't stand it. They stay in the villages on the borders.\r\nOnly a few are ever bold enough to start with a caravan and these soon\r\nturn back.\r\n\r\nWhen a desert Arab and his family start on a journey the tents, the\r\nsleeping-rugs, the scanty provisions, and the women and children are\r\npiled on the camels, the dogs take their places at the end of the\r\nprocession and the men at the head, and the caravan starts.\r\n\r\nAs the chieftain throws the end of the burnoose (his hooded cloak)\r\nacross his shoulder and, with his carbine in the hollow of his arm,\r\nstalks in advance of all, you feel that if you were an Arab boy you\r\nwould be as proud as he is to have a father like that. What a splendid\r\nfigure; what a strong, grave, handsome face, and utterly without fear!\r\nAll his poor possessions would hardly pay a month's rent in a fine city\r\napartment, but he has the proud bearing of a king. He looks as if he\r\nhad just stepped out of a picture in a Bible story-book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALL IN THE DAY'S WORK!\r\n\r\n  This looks to me like the beginning of a simoom; if so, we'd better\r\n  wrap _our_ shawls about our faces as the Arabs are doing. Notice\r\n  how the rising wind picks up and twirls the sand about the camels'\r\n  legs and sends it stinging into the faces of the men. Maybe it\r\n  will die down as quickly as it came; maybe it will increase into a\r\n  choking sand-storm that will last a week.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnd how keen those dark eyes must be; and what a memory for the look\r\nof things! At the beginning of the day's journey he is guided, as\r\nsailors are at sea, by the stars. But soon the winds begin to rise, as\r\nthe desert farther away is warming under the sun, and the fine sand\r\ndrifts and shifts like snow, filling up our own tracks as fast as they\r\nare made; so, you may be sure, it is leaving no guiding tracks made by\r\nprevious travellers. But this man has known every hill, every dune, and\r\nevery rocky gully along the way since he himself was a little boy, and\r\nwent over this same route sitting on the camel with his mother while\r\nhis father stalked on before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CARAVAN ON THE MARCH\r\n\r\n  Here is a caravan lumbering along over what appears to be a\r\n  pretty well-beaten roadway in Algeria where many improvements to\r\n  facilitate travel have been made by the French. It must be about\r\n  8.00 A. M. or 4.00 P. M. Shouldn't you say so, from the shadows?\r\n]\r\n\r\nPresently we come across another little group of travellers going in\r\nanother direction. They are on their way north to the summer pastures;\r\nfor you see they have a little flock of sheep and goats and two\r\ndonkeys. And there are two men. These people are probably two families\r\ntravelling together. But they are not so well-to-do as our Arab. They\r\nhave no camel to carry the women and children. So dogs, donkeys, men,\r\nwomen, children, and the sheep and goats all tramp along together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FORLORN LITTLE RAT OF THE DESERT SANDS\r\n\r\n  If you've read Roosevelt's books on Africa you've met this little\r\n  creature before. But isn't he the rattiest-looking rat you ever\r\n  saw? He has only a hair here and there on his yellow skin; and no\r\n  eyes to speak of. He can hardly see at all, spending most of his\r\n  time, as he does--like the sightless creatures of caves--in the\r\n  pitch-dark of his underground burrow. Yet, I suppose, like that\r\n  desert boy it tells about at the end of this chapter, he thinks\r\n  there's no place like home!\r\n]\r\n\r\nThey are not worried because they are poor; for listen, they are\r\nsinging! It's a melancholy kind of song, as we think. It reminds us\r\nof the queer sound the sand grains make when the desert winds are\r\nbeginning to blow. But to the Arab it is music. What a lot of verses it\r\nhas--all just alike--and sung over and over again.\r\n\r\nBut what's the matter now? All of a sudden they stop singing and\r\nbegin to shout and fire off their guns. You'll laugh when I tell you\r\nwhy. They heard something talking back to them; repeating all their\r\nwords. It was only an echo made by the rocks of the mountains that\r\nwe have just reached. But these superstitious people of the desert\r\ndon't know what an echo is. They think echoes are the voices of evil\r\nspirits mocking them, and the shouting and the firing of the guns is to\r\nfrighten these mockers away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PACK-RAT'S FORTRESS\r\n\r\n  This is a diagram of the fortress of another little citizen of\r\n  mountain rocks and desert places, known out West as the \"pack\" rat\r\n  because he is always packing off other people's things and hiding\r\n  them in his burrow. The \"fortress\" consists of several burrows,\r\n  the roads leading to which are carefully protected by the prickly\r\n  bayonets of the cactus joints which the rat drags there for that\r\n  purpose.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLife for everybody in the Sahara and the Arabian desert is very much\r\nwhat it is for the animals in the Arizona wastes--a constant struggle\r\nfor food. In the Arizona desert every living creature puts in all its\r\ntime trying to get something to eat without being eaten. The wildcat is\r\nfortunate if he gets a meal once in two or three days; and while the\r\ncoyote is trying to slip up on a rabbit, ten to one there's a panther\r\nslipping up on him. A traveller in northern Africa tells how, when his\r\ncaravan halted for dinner at an inn for the French soldiers quartered\r\nin that region, he saw a lean and hungry cat eying him from around the\r\ncorner of a nearby hut. To borrow from Victor Hugo's description of\r\nthe hungry cat at the Spanish inn,[31] this cat of the desert looked\r\nat the traveller \"as if it would have asked nothing better than to be\r\na tiger.\" When the guest of the inn had finished the piece of chicken\r\nhe was eating he tossed the bone toward the cat which pounced on it\r\nfiercely. Instantly a dog, which had been watching proceedings, rushed\r\nforward and took the bone from the cat. Just then an Arab, who happened\r\nto be passing, fell upon the dog and wrenching the bone from his mouth\r\nbegan eagerly gnawing it himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: \"Hugo's Letters to His Wife.\"]\r\n\r\nIt's a hard life!\r\n\r\nAnd yet if you should bring an Arab boy to London or New York to live\r\nand give him three good meals a day--he's not always sure of _one_ at\r\nhome--and nice clothes to wear and a real bed to sleep in, and shady\r\nparks to play in, do you suppose he would be happy? No indeed. The\r\nthing has been tried. He says this kind of life is all right for those\r\nwho like it, but it _isn't_ the desert.\r\n\r\nAnd you have to admit it!\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  Not at all dry, are they--these deserts--when you get down into\r\n  them? And I haven't told you half there is to tell about them.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: John C. Van Dyke, for one, has written a wonderfully\r\ninteresting little book just about the American desert. It's called\r\nsimply \"The Desert.\"]\r\n\r\n  To begin with, what does your geography say about deserts--about\r\n  how they are made?\r\n\r\n  How do mountains help make deserts?\r\n\r\n  In and near what zone does your geography locate the great deserts\r\n  of the world?\r\n\r\n  How does the Sahara desert compare in size with the United States?\r\n  (You see, the Sahara is practically a whole United States gone dry!)\r\n\r\n  Yet, the soil of much of the Sahara is very fertile and with water\r\n  would yield wonderful crops. But where is the water to come from?\r\n  Where do we get the water that has made our deserts bloom? Has the\r\n  Sahara any such sources of supply?\r\n\r\n  Is it true that the Libyan desert was once covered by the sea, as\r\n  it was in that story of Phaeton, the boy who set the world afire?\r\n\r\n  And speaking of that story, was there a Jupiter and a Jupiter\r\n  Pluvius, too?[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: \"That was a good deal like asking if there was a George\r\nWashington and a President Washington too,\" said the High School Boy,\r\nafter he had looked it up.]\r\n\r\n  Wouldn't you say the addition of \"Pluvius\" to the name of their\r\n  chief god meant the ancients recognized rain-making as a very\r\n  important and difficult business to manage?\r\n\r\n  But what is it, really, that brings our rains? What has the sea\r\n  to do with it? And the winds? And the mountains? Your geography\r\n  answers all these questions briefly. You will find a full treatment\r\n  of the whole subject of the weather and of how the weather man,\r\n  \"the man with a hundred eyes,\" manages to be so clever, in\r\n  \"Pictured Knowledge.\"[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: In the article in the Nature Department, \"What is the It\r\nthat Rains?\"]\r\n\r\n  From what general direction do the winds come that bring the rains\r\n  in North America? In South America? Why the difference?\r\n\r\n  How many inches of rainfall are enough for raising good crops?\r\n\r\n  Nevertheless, they raise fine crops in many parts of the United\r\n  States where they have hardly any rain at all. How do they manage\r\n  it? I mean how do they store up the water and distribute it, and\r\n  everything? (Irrigation.)\r\n\r\n  In reading up on deserts in the encyclopedias alone you will\r\n  find many such interesting things as the following, and in other\r\n  books--particularly books of travel--much more:\r\n\r\n  How long the commercial caravans are (such great freight trains as\r\n  those that cross the Sahara between Morocco and Timbuctoo); how\r\n  many camels one driver takes care of; how fast the camels travel;\r\n  how many days they can go without a drink.\r\n\r\n  If you're going to cross with one of these caravans (or just\r\n  pretend to cross) I must tell you one thing:\r\n\r\n  _You've got to look out for lions!_\r\n\r\n  From what you have learned in your geography about African lions,\r\n  where would you say you were likely to come across them?[35]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Have you read Roosevelt's \"African Game Trails\"? or his\r\n\"Life Histories of African Game Animals\"?]\r\n\r\n  What do these caravans bring back from Central Africa? (What is\r\n  produced in Central Africa that the civilized world wants?)\r\n\r\n  The ostrich is a most interesting citizen of the desert that I\r\n  didn't have room to talk about. There's enough for a whole chapter\r\n  in your notebook just about ostriches and their ways.\r\n\r\n  Among other things, I wish you'd find out for me if the ostrich\r\n  really does bury its head in the sand and imagine that it is\r\n  thereby hiding itself. (I'll warrant you it's only book ostriches\r\n  that do this; not real ostriches.)\r\n\r\n  One of the most curious things about Mrs. Ostrich is how she and\r\n  her neighbors work together. It's like an old-fashioned quilting\r\n  bee, for all the world; although, to be sure, the ostriches don't\r\n  make quilts--they make nests.[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: \"Romance of Animal Arts and Crafts.\"]\r\n\r\n  Speaking of ostrich nests naturally suggests eggs--and very big\r\n  eggs, of course, including the roc's egg in the \"Arabian Nights.\"\r\n  They do have real rock's eggs in the desert, only this kind of a\r\n  roc's egg is spelled with a \"k.\" You just turn to the chapter on\r\n  deserts in Hobb's \"Face of the Earth,\" and you'll find not only\r\n  that there are such eggs, but how the desert sun uses salt in\r\n  cooking them and what the crystal people have to do with it; and\r\n  how, like a cat in a hen-house, the desert winds suck these eggs,\r\n  leaving only the hollow shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                              (SEPTEMBER)\r\n\r\n                                Morning\r\n\r\n    The summer dawn's reflected hue\r\n    To purple changed Loch Katrine blue.\r\n\r\n                                       --_Scott_: \"_Lady of the Lake_.\"\r\n\r\nEvening\r\n\r\n    Now folds the lily all her sweetness up\r\n    And slips into the bosom of the lake.\r\n\r\n                                        --_Tennyson_: \"_The Princess_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE LANDS OF THE LAKES\r\n\r\nIf we really had spent the month of August in a desert what a relief it\r\nwould be to find ourselves, as we do now at the very beginning of the\r\ngolden autumn time, in the lands of the lakes with their cool, fresh\r\nbreezes, the whisper of leaves and the glint of waters dancing in the\r\nsun. The best of it is that the deserts are just as delightful as the\r\nlands of pleasant waters, if you only visit them in imagination as we\r\nhave been doing; and they make the lakes all the more attractive by way\r\nof contrast.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. How the Lakes are Born\r\n\r\nBut where are the lands of the lakes? I may say to start with, it's\r\nno use looking for many lakes in the lands of the big caves. Caves\r\nand lakes don't seem to get on together any more than do caves and\r\nboulders.\r\n\r\nWhen this story of the lakes was first told to a certain group of young\r\npeople some of the youngest of whom had not forgotten the giants or the\r\nlanguage of their fairy tales, I put it in this way:\r\n\r\n\"The rains and the rivers, with the help of some other things, have\r\nmade all the lakes in the world. One of these helpers is a bright-eyed\r\ncreature with two legs; another a little creature with four legs and\r\na third a great big thing with no legs at all!\" (I said it like this:\r\n\"G-R-E-A-T B-I-G T-H-I-N-G,\" and opened my eyes wide for the benefit of\r\nthe younger members of our \"pebble parties,\" as these little gatherings\r\ncame to be called.)\r\n\r\nThe great big things, as you have already guessed, were the glaciers of\r\nthe Ice Age. We have had specimens of their work in the story of how\r\nthe Great Lakes were made.\r\n\r\nThe four-legged lake makers are the beavers. They live on the margins\r\nof quiet, shallow ponds--really little lakes--which they make for\r\nthemselves by gnawing down trees and building dams.\r\n\r\nAnd the bright-eyed creature with two legs--can't you guess who he is?\r\nIf you never helped make little lakes of your own by damming up a brook\r\nor a roadside rivulet, you have missed a lot of fun.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIDE RANGE OF SIZE IN LAKE FAMILY\r\n\r\nBut you _must_ have made them; what boy hasn't? And those little ponds\r\nor puddles were lakes, while they lasted, just as much as the great\r\nLake Superior is a lake. Even lakes that are called lakes and get their\r\nnames (and often their pictures) in summer resort folders, differ in\r\nsize, ranging from little affairs that are not much larger than the\r\npond in the meadow, to Lake Superior, with its 31,000 square miles; and\r\nin depth, from a few feet to 5,618 feet in the deepest part of Lake\r\nBaikal. You see if you touched bottom there you would have to keep\r\ngoing for over a mile.\r\n\r\n\"And there's all the way back!\" said the High School Boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT LAKES OF TO-DAY AND\r\n               THE GREATER LAKE OF YESTERDAY\r\n\r\n  The farmers of Canada and the Dakotas now sow their harvests and\r\n  reap their golden grain on the bottom of the great inland sea of\r\n  the Ice Age, Lake Agassiz. It was larger than all the Great Lakes\r\n  of to-day put together. It is known how big this lake was from its\r\n  old beaches, which can easily be made out all around the margin\r\n  shown on the map.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLUE LAKE IN THE VOLCANO'S MOUTH\r\n\r\n  In the mouth of a dead volcano lies one of the most beautiful lakes\r\n  in all the world, the chief attraction of Crater Lake National\r\n  Park. This model of its basin tells how nature did the work. The\r\n  steep sides and the glacial valleys show that the top fell in\r\n  when the lava that helped build the volcano sank back and so left\r\n  it without support. If the top had blown off, as volcano tops\r\n  sometimes do, the valleys would have been filled with débris. Later\r\n  there was another outbreak, but so small that it only built that\r\n  little volcano in the big volcano's mouth. Notice the tiny crater?\r\n  This baby volcano rises above the waters of its mimic ocean and\r\n  makes an island, just as so many volcanoes of the great Pacific\r\n  make the far-flung islands of the Southern Seas.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEven the water ouzel, that wonderful diver of the mountain lakes and\r\nwaterfalls, might hesitate at a dive like that.\r\n\r\nThose remarkable old men of the mountains, the glaciers of the Ice\r\nAge, were the greatest of all lake-makers. Although for size the Great\r\nLakes were their masterpieces, they made lakes of all sizes and no end\r\nof them. They fairly sowed the landscape with lakes. Look at the map of\r\nthe lake regions of America and Europe and then turn back to the map\r\npicture of the great ice invasion (page 21). Don't you see the lake\r\nregions and what was once the ice regions cover practically the same\r\nterritory?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOKING ACROSS THE LAKE TO WIZARD ISLAND\r\n\r\n  There you see is the top of that little volcano--right across the\r\n  lake. It is known as \"Wizard Island.\" The lake is 4,000 feet deep.\r\n  Its walls are 1,500 feet high; in some places over 2,000 feet high.\r\n  In spite of the fact that they, as you see, slope a good deal,\r\n  owing to the crumbling down of the weathered rock, the banks are\r\n  still so steep it has taken us several hours of careful climbing to\r\n  get down where this picture was taken, and we shall be all the rest\r\n  of the forenoon climbing back again.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn addition to making lakes in their Great Lakes manner the glaciers\r\nhad other methods. A glacier coming into a dry mountain valley would\r\nsupply it with a river by melting, and at the same time dam up the\r\nriver with stones and soil brought down from the mountain and so make\r\na lake. Then the water would run over the brim of the dam, and the\r\nthing was complete; a beautiful little lake with one river running into\r\nit and another running out.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOKS AS IF IT HAD RAINED LAKES!\r\n\r\nYou just go through Wisconsin or Minnesota or Maine, and right and left\r\nyou'll see lakes and lakes and lakes: and then more lakes! Of course\r\nmost of these lakes are small; otherwise it wouldn't have been possible\r\nto work so many of them into the same landscape. In Wisconsin you find\r\nthese small lakes in what are called the \"Kettle Ranges.\" The low hills\r\nand their valleys form what the early settlers called \"kettles,\" and in\r\nthese kettles are the little blue-eyed lakes.\r\n\r\nIt was the glaciers that not only made the kettles but often filled\r\nthem with the lakes. In many of the mounds of pebbles and clay that\r\nwe read about in \"The Secrets of the Hills,\" the glaciers left big\r\nblocks of ice. Then, when this ice melted, two things happened: (1)\r\nThe covering of the ice sank down, much as the sawdust sinks in an\r\nice-house when a block of ice is taken out, thus making the kettle; (2)\r\nthe big ice cake in the hill of pebbles melted, so filling the kettle\r\nwith a lake.\r\n\r\nBut what broke off these big blocks, these land icebergs that made the\r\nbasins for the kettle lakes? They were left by the glacier when it\r\nbegan to retreat; that is to say when the supply of snow back at the\r\ngathering ground became insufficient to keep pushing it forward as fast\r\nas the front melted away. Melting most rapidly in those huge cracks\r\ncalled crevasses, big blocks were finally separated entirely from the\r\nmain body and left behind as the rest of the glacier slowly melted back\r\ntoward the mountains.\r\n\r\nIf the glaciers were thus responsible for most of the lakes of the\r\nlowlands you may be sure they had a hand in making the lakes of the\r\nmountains, right where they themselves live. John Muir, who spent his\r\nlife in loving study of the mountains of the West and of everything\r\nconnected with them, found mountain lakes in every stage of existence\r\nup the mountainsides; empty stone bowls that showed by the work of the\r\nwaves on the rocks that they had once held lakes; above these, in the\r\nsame chain, lakes growing shallow; and, still higher, brand new lakes\r\nin stone bowls with the edge of the glacier that had carved out the\r\nbowl and filled it with blue water, still bordering it on the upper\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE KETTLE LAKES OF WISCONSIN]\r\n\r\nAnd this is why, like fruit on a tree, the youngest lakes are found at\r\nthe top. Since the glacier melted from the foot of the range upward the\r\nlower lakes were the first to be born and the first to pass away; while\r\nthe lakes higher up on the mountain were the last to be born and the\r\nlast to pass away.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Moods of the Lakes\r\n\r\nLakes are like the rivers and the sea; they have their moods. In\r\nsunshine and storm, in wind and calm, and from season to season they\r\nshow many changes. As we already know they are great sleepy heads. To\r\nRuskin mountain lakes seemed both to sleep and to dream. But their\r\nlongest sleep, like that of Br'er Bear, is taken in the winter. Of this\r\nlong sleep Mr. Muir says:[37]\r\n\r\n\"The highest (mountain lakes) are set in bleak, rough bowls, scantily\r\nfringed with brown and yellow sedges. Winter storms blow snow through\r\nthe canyon in blinding drifts, and avalanches shoot from the heights.\r\nThen are these sparkling tarns filled and buried, leaving not a hint of\r\ntheir existence. In June and July they begin to blink and thaw out like\r\nsleepy eyes, the daisies bloom in turn and the most profoundly buried\r\nof them all is at length warmed and summered as if winter were only a\r\ndream.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: \"The Mountains of California.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nEVEN THE DUCKS OVERLOOK THESE LITTLE LAKES\r\n\r\nBut possibly these lakes are not asleep after all! They may be only\r\nplaying possum; or hide and seek. There _are_ mountain lakes that play\r\nhide and seek. That is to say, they hide and _you_ seek; and often you\r\ndon't find! They are so small that, surrounded as they are by trees,\r\ntall and thickly set, even the ducks pass them by. The glaciers that\r\nmade them seem to have hidden them, as the robins did the babes in the\r\nwood. The glaciers did this, not by heaping leaves over them, but by\r\npiling up stones and soil around them. They are encircled by moraines,\r\nand on the moraines grow the trees that hide the lakelets even from the\r\nsharp eyes of the ducks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LITTLE GIRL'S PICTURE OF A FAMOUS SWISS LAKE\r\n\r\n  This picture of the lake of the Great St. Bernard was taken by\r\n  Phyllis M. Pulliam, who sent it to _St. Nicholas_ with a long,\r\n  enthusiastic letter, such as only school-girls know how to write.\r\n  Among other things she met a great St. Bernard dog that had saved\r\n  more than fifty lives.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMountain lakes are usually as clear as crystal, and, like perfect\r\nmirrors, reflect the outlines and coloring of the clouds and the\r\nneighboring peaks. They are apt to contain mica and feldspar ground out\r\nof the granite rock by the glacier that made their basins. Then the\r\nsunlight falling on these rock particles gives them the color of jade\r\nor Nile green, or dark green like a peacock's tail. They are constantly\r\nchanging color with the changing angles of the light from morning until\r\nsunset; and under the passing clouds and the rippling of the winds. The\r\ndeeper lakes are dark blue in the deepest parts, turning to green in\r\nthe shallow waters near shore where the yellow of the sun rays and the\r\nsand mixes most with the blue of the waters.[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Van Dyke: \"The Mountain.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY IS IN THE SECRET PASSAGE\r\n\r\nIn Florida there are sister lakes so sympathetic that their waters rise\r\nand fall together. One responds to the mood of the other as promptly as\r\nyour right eye waters in sympathy when you get a grain of dust in the\r\nleft. The reason for this goes back to the days when the corals helped\r\nbuild Florida. They did this by leaving their \"bones\" on the coral\r\nreefs when that part of North America was in the making. These remains\r\nformed limestone. Then, in this limestone, \"sink holes\" were formed on\r\nthe surface leading to underground passages, just as they do over the\r\nland surface in the cave regions of Kentucky. These sink holes often\r\nfill with water and form little lakes. These lakes, being connected\r\nby the underground passages, rise and fall together. It looks very\r\nstrange, even when you know the secret of it; and still stranger when\r\nyou don't.\r\n\r\nYet I shouldn't be surprised if a bright boy or girl seeing two lakes\r\nrising or falling together would suspect the underground connection;\r\nfor, of course, we all know about springs and their underground\r\nchannels. But what would you say to this:\r\n\r\nA lake that, a moment before, was as smooth as glass suddenly begins\r\nto shiver all over as one shivers in a sudden draught. But there is no\r\nbreeze stirring! A moment later the water rises and falls along the\r\nbanks; an inch, two inches, a foot, two feet. Then, in the course of a\r\ncouple of hours, the sky, which before was without a cloud, begins to\r\ngrow black and there follows a terrific storm.\r\n\r\n\r\nA KIND OF NATURAL BAROMETER\r\n\r\nThe cause of the rising of the water is the heavier pressure of the air\r\nat the farther end of the lake, the region of the coming storm. The\r\nwater, being forced down at one end of the basin, you see, rises at the\r\nother. Then as the storm advances toward you the pressure is released\r\nand the water falls again; but for a while it rocks to and fro as water\r\nwill do in a basin if you tip it up at one end and then let it down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIDES IN A TEACUP\r\n\r\nBut, besides these imitation tides made by the unequal pressure of\r\nthe wind, lakes have real tides just as the ocean does; and from the\r\nsame cause, the attraction of the moon. In fact, there are tides in a\r\nteacup, and the tea rises toward the passing moon as does everything\r\nliquid on the face of the earth. In the teacup the rise is so small you\r\ncan't see it as you do when the great mass of the ocean waters is moved\r\nin the same way. Even in the Great Lakes the tide only amounts to three\r\ninches or so.\r\n\r\nAnd, in addition to their tides, there are many other things about\r\nlakes that have led the largest of them to be referred to as \"inland\r\nseas.\" Says Reclus:[39]\r\n\r\n\"Lakes are indeed seas. They have their tempests, their swells, their\r\nbreakers. It is true the waves are neither so high nor move so rapidly\r\nas those of the sea because they do not move over such great depths.\r\nThey are short, compact and choppy, but for this very reason they are\r\nmore formidable. And the water being fresh and therefore lighter than\r\nthat of the ocean is more readily agitated. The wind has scarcely begun\r\nto stir when the surface is covered with foaming billows.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: \"The Earth.\"]\r\n\r\nNot only are lake storms especially dangerous for the reasons just\r\ngiven by the great French geographer but lakes in mountain regions are\r\nsubject to an additional danger; for their storms are most apt to come\r\nat night, just as described in the story of the storm on Galilee in the\r\nNew Testament. You remember it says the storm came \"down.\"[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Luke 8: 23.]\r\n\r\n\"Now it came to pass on a certain day that Jesus went into a ship with\r\nhis disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other\r\nside of the lake. And they launched forth.\r\n\r\n\"But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind\r\non the lake; and they were filled with water and were in jeopardy.\"\r\n\r\nMacgregor, in his \"Rob Roy on the Jordan,\" draws the following vivid\r\npicture of his own struggles with one of these tempests:\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE STORM CAME DOWN ON GALILEE\r\n\r\n\"Just as the Rob Roy passed below Wady Fik a strange, distant hissing\r\nsounded ahead where we could see a violent storm was raging. The waves\r\nhad not time to rise. The gusts had come down on calm water and they\r\nwhisked long wreaths of it up into the sky. This torrent of heavy, cold\r\nair was pouring over the mountain crests into the deep caldron of the\r\nlake below. Just as it says in Luke 8:23. 'There came _down_ a storm\r\nupon the lake.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE BORDERS OF THE SEA OF GALILEE\r\n\r\n  You can see this is in a desert, mountainous country, and, from the\r\n  dress of the man, that it is in the Orient. The beach is wide--for\r\n  so small a lake--because of those frequent and severe storms that\r\n  drive the waves, loaded with sand and pebbles, far back from the\r\n  shore.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity of squalls among mountains is known to all who have\r\nboated much on lakes, but on the Sea of Galilee the wind has a singular\r\nforce and suddenness. This is no doubt because the sea is so deep in\r\nthe world that the sun rarefies the air in it enormously and the wind,\r\nspeeding swiftly over a long and level plateau, suddenly comes upon\r\nthis huge gap in the way and tumbles down into it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. How Lakes Grow Old and Pass Away\r\n\r\nBut, however formed, lakes, of all the features of our landscape, are\r\nthe soonest to pass away. Because of the sediment brought into them by\r\nthe rivers they keep getting more and more shallow and at last, in the\r\ncourse of time, are quite filled up. The waves of the lakes themselves\r\nhelp to bring this about by cutting material from their shores and\r\nwashing it into the water.\r\n\r\nSo the time will come when all lakes now in existence will have passed\r\naway. But the people of those times will not be without their lakes.\r\nNew lakes will probably be made by the same causes which produced the\r\nlakes of to-day; for Nature's great processes do not change.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY LILIES COME TO THE DYING LAKES\r\n\r\nMeanwhile how beautifully they pass, these lakes; particularly the\r\nlittle lakes like that in Rousseau's painting. First, on the margin of\r\na dying lake the lilies gather. Lilies grow only in quiet waters and\r\nthese they find in the shallow margins of lakes that are filling up.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST OF ALL COME THE TREES\r\n\r\nNext after the lilies come the sedges, grasslike herbs that grow in\r\nmarshy places. And after they are well established they get things\r\nready for the next arrivals; for these plants come in a regular\r\nprocession. The dense tufts of the sedges make mats on which soil\r\ngathers. In this soil shrubs begin to grow. From the decay of all\r\nthis vegetation more soil is formed in which the seeds of spruce and\r\ntamarack spring up. Then come willows, then poplars and maples, and\r\nlast of all the oaks and nut-bearing trees, which march into new lands\r\nslowly because they must depend on their heavy seeds to move them\r\nforward, while the little seeds of maple, willow, poplar, and pine are\r\neasily carried by the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _\"The Lake.\" From the painting by Rousseau_\r\n\r\n                   HOW LAKES GROW OLD AND PASS AWAY\r\n\r\n  This picture, called \"The Lake,\" is from a painting by Rousseau, a\r\n  great French landscape artist, and illustrates the beautiful way\r\n  in which lakes grow old, as described in the text. Already, as you\r\n  see, Father Oak and his family have arrived.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut while fresh-water lakes and their surroundings are so beautiful\r\nand poetic, and never more so than when the lakes are passing away,\r\nthere are dying lakes, whose surroundings are the very pictures of\r\ndesolation. These are the lakes which have become bitter with salt\r\nbecause their waters are evaporated by the sun faster than fresh water\r\ncomes in. The most famous of these salt lakes is the Dead Sea of the\r\nHoly Land, into which the Jordan flows. Lying in a rock-bound pit, in\r\nthe deepest part of a vast trench, it is like a caldron into which for\r\neight months of every year is poured the heat from a burning sun in a\r\ncloudless sky. Although Palestine, as you can see by the map, is in\r\nthe temperate zone, the thermometer here often registers 130 degrees,\r\nbecause cooling breezes never come down into this pit except in those\r\noccasional storms due to the sudden rush of cooler and therefore\r\nheavier air from the surrounding heights.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS HOW THE DEAD SEA DIED\r\n\r\nAs shown by the wave-cut terraces on the surrounding rocks this lake\r\nwas once a part of a great body of water that extended clear from Mount\r\nHermon to the Red Sea. Then, by a series of heaving movements, widely\r\nseparated in time (as shown by the depth of the beach terraces) the\r\nbottom of this greater sea was uplifted into the two parallel chains of\r\nlimestone mountains which flank the Jordan Valley. At the same time a\r\ngreat block of earth crust between them settled down, step by step, and\r\nmade the long trench running clear to Africa, one end of which is the\r\nJordan Valley, in which the Dead Sea lies.\r\n\r\nLater, during the different Ice Ages, as it is supposed, there was\r\nplenty of moisture, for the rock records show that the Sea of Galilee\r\nand what is now the Dead Sea were once parts of the same body of water.\r\nThen the climate gradually changed, the land went dry, and the Dead\r\nSea water became far saltier than that of the ocean--so salty that all\r\nlife died out of it. To-day the water tastes like a mixture of epsom\r\nsalts and quinine, and any unfortunate fish swept into it by the fresh\r\nwaters of the Jordan, in which fish are abundant, gives a few desperate\r\ngasps and dies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEAD SEA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE DEAD SEA DIED]\r\n\r\nWhile it is not true, as the ancients believed, that birds drop dead\r\nin flying over it, neither birds nor beasts make their homes in the\r\nchoking pit; and on its shores, always gray with a mixture of mud and\r\nsalt, of course no green thing can grow. Indeed, there is little plant\r\nlife anywhere round about, but as if in mockery there grow nearby what\r\nare known as apples of Sodom or Dead Sea fruit. This fruit looks like\r\nan orange, but it is bitter to the taste and filled only with fibre and\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nThe official report of Lieutenant Lynch, of the United States Navy, who\r\nheaded an expedition sent out by the government to explore the Dead Sea\r\nand the surrounding regions, is full of word pictures which might well\r\nhave supplied material for the imagination of Dante.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIKE A VAT OF MOLTEN METAL\r\n\r\nThe sea, yellow from the large amount of phosphorus in the water, is\r\noverhung in the early morning by a dense mist. This mist is made by the\r\nwater steaming in the intense heat. It looks, however, like smoke above\r\na great vat of molten metal \"fused but motionless.\" After dark, when\r\nthe night winds come down from the heights and go moaning through the\r\ngorges, the scene changes.\r\n\r\n\"The surface becomes one wide sheet of phosphorescent foam, and the\r\nwaves, as they break on the shore, throw a sepulchral light on the\r\nwhite skeletons of dead trees which have been washed from the woody\r\nbanks of the Jordan and, lying half buried in the sand, are coated with\r\ngray salt from the muddy spray.\"\r\n\r\nOn a portion of the land now covered by the lake, according to\r\ntradition, were the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and after\r\ntheir destruction these bitter waters flowed in and forever buried the\r\nscene of their wickedness from the sight of men.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the region did once support a larger population.\r\nWe know this to be true of other parts of the Orient which have since\r\nbecome desolate owing to the ravages of war, the change of climate, and\r\nthe decay of Oriental civilization. And when we recall how the sinking\r\nof the great earth block that carried this land so far below the level\r\nof the sea forced lava up through the earth cracks, we can account for\r\n\"the fire from heaven\" that poured down upon the cities of the plain.\r\n\r\nProfessor Huntington, who headed the Yale Expedition into Palestine\r\nin 1909, speaks of visiting the ruins of Suweim south of the Dead Sea\r\nand picking up bits of lava (the whole region abounds in evidences of\r\nvolcanic action) while the sheik who acted as guide told the story of\r\nSodom as the story of Suweim. The name Suweim, Professor Huntington\r\nthinks, may be a corruption of Sodom. Continuing, he says:[41]\r\n\r\n\"The place is much greener than the other side of the valley, and in\r\nthe days of Lot may have been 'like the garden of Jehovah'[42]; for in\r\nthose times, as our studies of old levels of the Dead Sea quite clearly\r\nindicate, the climate of Palestine was probably decidedly moister than\r\nit is now.\r\n\r\n\"And not two miles from Suweim we found a little volcano of very recent\r\ndate geologically, and an eruption may have wrought havoc in a town\r\nlocated near Suweim.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: \"Palestine and Its Transformation.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Genesis 13:10.]\r\n\r\nIn one part of the valley he also found a cave among the mountains,\r\nhewn out of the limestone above a spring.\r\n\r\nNow turn to your Bible, Genesis 9:30:\r\n\r\n\"And Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountain, in a cave, he\r\nand his two daughters.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, the geography of the region--such is the conclusion of\r\nProfessor Huntington's careful study--\"supplies all the elements of the\r\nstory of Sodom and Gomorrah in exactly the location where the Biblical\r\naccount would lead one to expect them.\"\r\n\r\nBut the native Arab goes further. Not far from the borders of the Dead\r\nSea is a mountain of salt called Jebel Usdem, which \"the early and\r\nlater rains\" in the course of ages have dissolved into many fantastic\r\nshapes. Among these strange figures is a pillar tapering toward the\r\ntop, on which is a wide cap of stone, such as that shown on page 60 and\r\nsuch as are often seen on detached and pillared rocks.\r\n\r\nBut this gaunt remnant of grisly gray, although it is still obviously a\r\npart of the mountain and cannot be less than forty feet high, your Arab\r\nfriend insists was once the wife of Lot!\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  If you were hunting for mountain lakes where would you expect to\r\n  find the most, in high mountains or in low?\r\n\r\n  Rivers sometimes make lakes by using the same stuff the small\r\n  boys do, just plain mud. Look at Lake Pontchartrain in the map of\r\n  Louisiana and you can see one of the ways in which this is done.\r\n  Remember that all the land around this lake is part of the delta of\r\n  the Mississippi. The river deposits have simply enclosed a portion\r\n  of the shallow sea.\r\n\r\n  Or--this is another way in which rivers make lakes by building mud\r\n  walls--a river emptying at right angles into a narrow gulf may\r\n  build a dam clear across it. The rich Imperial Valley of southern\r\n  California was cut off from the Gulf of California in this way.\r\n  Look at the map and you can see just how this was done.\r\n\r\n  One of the puzzles about mountain lakes is how frogs got into them.\r\n  The frogs never climbed up there, you may be sure. Muir thinks\r\n  maybe the ducks did it. How do you suppose? See if you can imagine\r\n  and then see what Muir says about it.[43]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: \"The Mountains of California.\"]\r\n\r\n  In connection with what was said about lakes playing they are\r\n  oceans--not these little mountain lakes, of course, but great\r\n  big lakes--you will be interested in what Lord Bryce says in his\r\n  \"Travels in South America\" about why lakes may even look larger\r\n  than the ocean.\r\n\r\n  In the Britannica and other books that you may not yet be old\r\n  enough to read you will find many more curious things about lakes.\r\n  I can't tell which one of my readers you are, you see, but if you\r\n  belong to the \"younger set,\" father, mother, or some other member\r\n  of the family can do the looking up and then tell you about it.[44]\r\n  In the Britannica will be found such interesting things as this:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: I don't know of anything that is more fun, of an evening,\r\nthan looking up things in an encyclopædia--except looking them up in\r\n_two_ encyclopædias.]\r\n\r\n  How certain kinds of mountains and lakes are made at one and the\r\n  same time--by the same movement.\r\n\r\n  How even the wind may make lakes.\r\n\r\n  Why lakes are to the land what lands are to the sea.\r\n\r\n  Then if you will turn to page 75 of that fascinating little book we\r\n  have already dipped into several times[45] you will find what the\r\n  fact that lakes are to the land what islands are to the sea has to\r\n  do with a peculiar beetle in the Shetland Islands (where the ponies\r\n  come from) and the famous tailless cat of the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: \"Colin Clout's Calendar.\"]\r\n\r\n  One of the quaintest little bits of real life in Lakeland is how\r\n  the baby gulls of the Great Lakes worry their papas and mamas by\r\n  going swimming before they are old enough; how their parents give\r\n  them a spanking and send them back home; and how kind all the lady\r\n  gulls are to the little gulls of neighbors that come to their\r\n  houses to play with their children.[46]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: \"The Bird, Our Brother,\" by Olive Thorne Miller.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DROWNED VALLEYS ON THE MAINE COAST\r\n\r\n  Wherever you see very irregular shores, as along the coast of\r\n  Maine, you may infer that the shores have sunk so that the waters\r\n  of the sea came up into the river valleys, and the hills and long\r\n  tongues of high land became islands and peninsulas.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                               (OCTOBER)\r\n\r\n    To-night the winds begin to rise\r\n      And roar from yonder dropping day;\r\n      The last red leaf is whirled away,\r\n    The rooks are blown about the skies.\r\n\r\n                                                          --_Tennyson._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTUMN WINDS AND THE ROCK MILLS OF THE SEA\r\n\r\nNothing looks more aimless, more unorganized, perhaps, than the long\r\nturmoil of the waves of the sea which begins in late autumn and\r\ncontinues through the winter months. If, with your nose well over the\r\nedge of a cliff, you look straight down, you will see something like\r\nthis: With every forward leap of the surges the waters are divided and\r\nentangled among the rocks, and division after division is beaten back\r\nby the upright wall in front and the broken blocks of stone on this\r\nside and on that. On-coming waves, met by those recoiling, rise into\r\nmountainous, struggling masses of wild fury. The whole affair seems to\r\nbe as clear a case of wasted energy as a Mexican revolution.\r\n\r\nBut if you watch the waves carefully and study them a little you will\r\nsee underlying and controlling this apparent anarchy the wonderful\r\nengineering by which the machinery of the sea works out its appointed\r\ntasks. It is when the earth has gathered its harvests and laid down\r\nto its winter rest that the sea begins gathering harvests of its own,\r\ngrinding up the rocks for food for the plants in its gardens, for\r\nnew clothes for its shell-fish, and new soil for earth harvests in\r\nmillenniums yet to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Destroyer\r\n\r\nOn the face of it the case looks bad. The sea's chief business seems\r\nto be that of eating us up, or at least the lands on which we live.\r\nAnd this idea of it we find running through all literature and art. A\r\nvery large number of the pictures of the sea, probably the majority,\r\nshow it in wind and storm. And this is still more true of the famous\r\nsea pictures of literature. Shakespere, for example, makes some three\r\nhundred references to the sea, and nearly always, where he gives it a\r\ncharacter, it is that of a monster, always hungry and never satisfied,\r\na \"wild, rude sea,\" a sea \"raging like an angry boar\"--and so back to\r\nHomer and forward to Kipling.\r\n\r\nThat the sea is constantly eating away the land cannot be denied, and\r\nto an extent that is delightfully alarming if, as did the little boy\r\nlistening to the tale of the giants, we \"like to be made nervous.\" It\r\nis said that England still rules the waves, but where she fronts the\r\nsea on the east the coast is being cut back at the rate of two to four\r\nyards a year, in spite of all that modern engineering skill can do. In\r\nthe course of a thousand years the losses on all fronts have amounted\r\nto over 500 square miles. Each year carries off 1,500 acres more from\r\nthe king's domains, to add them to the Empire of the Sea, \"and he calls\r\nto us still unfed.\" On the east coast the blows dealt by the waves in\r\nsevere storms are such that the land trembles for a mile back from\r\nthe shore. \"The earth,\" said Emerson,[47] speaking of the industrial\r\ngreatness of England, \"shakes under the thunder of its mills.\" So for\r\nages it has shaken under the thunder of the mills of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: \"English Traits.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of \"The Scientific American\"_\r\n\r\n                     SEA-CLIFFS IN THE SCHOOLROOM\r\n\r\n  These dizzy cliffs and the wide sea beyond were made in the\r\n  schoolroom in the same way that the glacier and the iceberg were\r\n  made in Chapter II.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of \"The Scientific American\"_\r\n\r\n                           BEHIND THE SCENES\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis apparent war of the sea upon the land is a war of machinery whose\r\nworkings are curiously like the ancient war machinery of men. Without\r\ntools the sea is almost as helpless as man himself; and, as in man's\r\nhistory, its use of tools begins with the Stone Age. Where there is no\r\nstone-strewn beach or underwater shelf extending out from a cliff, the\r\nwaves do little damage. They give only a muffled and (to the poetic\r\near) a baffled roar. But a sloping shelf along a rocky shore not only\r\nmakes a kind of scaling ladder on which the waves can climb to great\r\nheights, but these waves are pitched forward with terrific force\r\nas they reach it from the open sea. As they come on they seize huge\r\nstones which they hurl against the cliffs. Even amid the wild voices of\r\ntempests one hears the boulders crashing against the walls. In storms\r\nof sufficient energy rocks of three tons weight are driven forward like\r\npebbles. The action against the upper part of a cliff may be compared\r\nto that of one of those great stone-throwing engines of the Romans,\r\nwhile on the lower portion the drive suggests the battering-ram.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT NEPTUNE KNOWS ABOUT WEDGES AND PNEUMATIC TOOLS\r\n\r\nWhere the waves strike into narrowing crevices in the rocks they act as\r\nwedges, prying the walls apart. In this form of the sea's destructive\r\nwork we find also an application of a motive power which has come to\r\nplay so important a part in modern engineering; namely, compressed air.\r\nWaves strong enough to handle big rocks not only dash them against the\r\ncliff, while the waves themselves drive into the crevices like wedges,\r\nbut in so doing they force air into the crevices and compress it. This\r\nair, expanding as the waves fall back, forces out great blocks of stone\r\nwhich, in turn, are also used as weapons of assault.\r\n\r\nAnd, as we look back in the history of the sea, we find that he long\r\nago--the deep-laid schemer!--planted enemies within our very walls.\r\nWaves, even when armed with the heaviest missiles, can do comparatively\r\nlittle damage to walls in which there are no crevices. But there are\r\nfew such walls. Usually even the hardest rocks have running through\r\nthem those cracks which the geologists (with a fine sense of humor)\r\ncall \"joints\"; or they have \"bedding planes,\" the divisions between\r\nthe rock beds. Both of these weaknesses in our defensive walls are,\r\nin a large degree, the handiwork of the sea; the bedding planes\r\nbecause rocks are so laid in the sea mills, and the joints because the\r\nwrinkling up and consequent cracking of the land rocks is the other\r\nend, as we learned in Chapter I, of the down-wrinkling of the rocks\r\nunder the weight of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the very body of the rocks also is hidden a secret enemy; the salt\r\nleft when they were made. And more salt is constantly being forced into\r\nthe surface pores as the waves strike. This salt helps to dissolve and\r\nweaken the rock under the chemical action of the air, and the rains and\r\nthe mechanical expansion and contraction of the surface with changes of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANING MILLS OF THE WINTER SEA\r\n\r\nAll the Great Powers of nature, \"on land, on sea, and in the air,\"\r\nseem to be in open conspiracy against our peace. The evidence seems\r\nespecially plain in late fall and winter, when the sea, contrary to the\r\nusual practice in war, carries on its most vigorous campaigns. Then\r\ncome the winds for the great drives; then come the frosts that change\r\nthe water wedges into expanding blocks of ice that, almost with the\r\nforce of exploding shells, tear the walls apart. In winter are formed\r\nthe great ice-fields that help in two ingenious ways to further the\r\ndestructive action of the storm waves. In bays and smaller recesses in\r\nrocky shores, the ice has embedded in it fragments of stone which the\r\nsea has battered down. The constant plunge of the waves breaks up these\r\nice-fields into sections which, with the embedded stones, become rude\r\nplaning mills. Where a headland is sloping, these planers, driven back\r\nand forth by the waves, chisel the rock away as a planer chisels down a\r\npiece of steel upon which it has been set to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW STONES ARE CARRIED OUT TO SEA\r\n\r\nA no less curious feature of sea engineering is the use of ice-fields\r\nas \"conveyors.\" During the spring, summer, and autumn the masses of\r\nstone which the sea brings down from the cliffs on its occasional busy\r\ndays--that is to say on days when the winds are high--pile up and so\r\nform a kind of bulwark against further attacks. But when in winter\r\nthese stones become embedded as above described, strong offshore winds\r\ncarry the ice-fields, stones and all, out to sea. Then, on shore, wind\r\nand wave take up their work again unchecked. All along the rocky shores\r\nof the Atlantic, as far south as New York State, beyond which no rock\r\nwalls come down to the shore, all these interesting things may be seen\r\nby the traveller.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of this team-work of natural forces in feeding the land\r\nto the sea is that steady advance of the waters upon certain shores. As\r\nif science herself had joined literature and art in giving the old sea\r\ndog a bad name, these advances are called in the language of geology,\r\n\"transgressions of the sea.\" These transgressions are caused in part\r\nby the gradual sinking of the land and in part by the rising of the\r\nwaters. It is not possible always to tell which agency is at work.\r\nOften both may be. One thing about the rising of the waters themselves\r\nmight be looked at as particularly alarming. The rivers, which, of\r\ncourse, are parts of one great water system, whose centre and prime\r\nmover is the sea, are not only constantly wearing the land down toward\r\nsea level but raising the sea level by the inpour of vast quantities\r\nof ground-up land. Even as matters stand, the amount of water in the\r\nsea bowls is so great that if all lands were at the present sea level\r\nthey would be covered everywhere to a depth of two miles. Wind-borne\r\ndust from the surface of the land and from volcanic explosions also, in\r\ntime, amounts to a pretty sum; and, of course, helps makes the waters\r\nof the sea rise upon the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEARING DOWN THE LAND AND FILLING UP THE SEA\r\n\r\nAlready the sea has advanced a thousand feet or more upon the coasts of\r\nMaine, to take one instance; and the whole ragged outline of Europe is\r\ndue to the same cause. Let this sort of thing go on and it is easy to\r\nsee that it will only be a question of a few millions of years when New\r\nYork, London, and other centres of busy life will be buried like the\r\nwicked cities of the plain.\r\n\r\nAnd if, to help complete this picture of desolation, we for a moment\r\nforget what we learned about the life insurance carried by the\r\ncontinents, we can imagine how they too will disappear. And the Last\r\nMan thus:\r\n\r\n    For now I stand as one upon a rock\r\n    Environed with a wilderness of sea,\r\n    Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave\r\n    Expecting ever when some envious surge,\r\n    Will, in his brinish bowels, swallow him.[48]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Shakespere: \"Titus Andronicus.\"]\r\n\r\nTo make the thing seem doubly sure, let us reflect with Mr. Burroughs\r\nthat the world is now probably in a time of spring, following the\r\nlatest of the Ice Ages. If so, the water now locked up in snow-fields\r\nand glaciers among the mountain peaks will, before this summer of the\r\ncenturies is over, all melt back into the sea. This alone will be good\r\nfor a rise of some thirty feet in sea level.\r\n\r\nThen, still later, we shall no doubt have another Ice Age, and the only\r\nthing that may save us from being frozen to death is the fact that we\r\nhave previously been drowned!\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Builder\r\n\r\nBut it's all a bad dream; a delusion of the mind, and of the eye. We\r\nsee these things--the destruction of the land, the invasions of the\r\nsea--but we do not see them as they are because we do not see far\r\nenough. Looked at broadly, and reading the story of it to the end, we\r\nlearn that the whole relation of the sea to the land and its life and\r\nbeauty is that of a builder and fatherly provider. Far from being the\r\nsavage creature he has been pictured, Father Neptune seems to have the\r\nkindly disposition of old King Cole combined with the wisdom of King\r\nSolomon. Everywhere is evidence not only of the highest intelligence\r\nbut of good will toward man and his brother tenants of the waters,\r\nfields, and woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT THE SEA IS THIS\r\n\r\nTo begin with you remember it was the sea that helped put the world\r\non the map. Of course, if we had not already learned in the story of\r\nhow the continents came up out of the sea, that there is no cause for\r\nalarm, we might imagine that having been lifted up they might, by a\r\nreversal of the process, be lifted down again. Indeed, I find a writer\r\nin a popular periodical dealing in science stating that \"every part of\r\nthe sea floor becomes, in its turn, the shore line and is subjected\r\nto the wear of the waves.\" But, as a matter of fact, we know that\r\nthe continents have finally got their land legs; that for ages the\r\ntransgressions of the sea have been mainly confined to the continental\r\nmargins; and that unless the earth's shrunken centre should, from some\r\nunimaginable cause, swell back to its old size, it is mechanically\r\nimpossible for the entire bottoms of the vast reservoirs of the sea to\r\nbe raised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARBOR ENGINEERING OF THE RIVERS AND THE SEA\r\n\r\n  In the mouths of certain rivers emptying into the sea the tides\r\n  come rushing up in a roaring wave like this. When the tide goes out\r\n  the water flows back again. This back-and-forth motion helps to\r\n  broaden the harbor made by the river's mouth, as in the case of New\r\n  York Harbor, which is the mouth of the Hudson. Owing to this tidal\r\n  action the water of the Hudson backs up clear to Albany.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GOLDEN GATE FOR FRISCO\r\n\r\n  The famous Golden Gate of San Francisco (so called because of the\r\n  golden sunsets shining through), and its splendid harbor, made by\r\n  the sinking of the land. The gate was originally cut by the waters\r\n  of those two rivers that join and flow into the bay. What rivers\r\n  are they?\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE SEA HELPS MAKE GOOD FARMS AND BIG CITIES\r\n\r\nMoreover the rivers, in the very act of wearing down the land and with\r\nit filling up the sea, help keep the land from being flooded, as it\r\nwould be if something were not done. For, as we learned in the story\r\nof why the mountains border the sea the sediment poured in by the\r\nrivers helps raise the mountains and the land along the sea border. It\r\nis during the downward movement of the continental margins that most\r\nsediment is spread from the inpouring rivers because the dip of the\r\nland is greater and the swifter current not only cuts down the land\r\nfaster, but carries the sediment farther out from shore. Here the new\r\nrock is made from old worn-out soil, and, since these new rocks when\r\nbrought to the surface will in time decay, fresh soil is thus prepared\r\nfor future generations. More immediate benefits of this sinking of\r\nshores and advance of waters are the harbors which have made great\r\ncities like New York and London, on or near the seacoast. These harbors\r\nare all the results of \"transgressions,\" combined with the digging\r\naction of wave and tide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Copyright by Underwood & Underwood_\r\n\r\n                    STONE TERRACES FOR THE GANNETS\r\n\r\n  This picture shows what the rising of the land and the\r\n  architectural engineering of the sea did for the gannets on the\r\n  coast of Canada.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKING A HINT FROM THE SEA'S SHORE ENGINEERING\r\n\r\nBut the sea builds shores as well as eats them. Its chief work in this\r\nline is the widening of the continental shelf by building it up with\r\nrock made of the sea's own grist from its shores, and the sediment\r\npoured in by the rivers. This work is not \"delivered,\" so to speak,\r\nfor millions of years, when the sinking shores begin to rise again,\r\nbut the sea, in its wave work, does shore building of another kind\r\nthat shows above the waters in the generation in which it is done. On\r\nwide, shallow beaches, storm waves break some distance from the shore,\r\nand, so losing their force, drop the sediment which they have stirred\r\nup, after carrying it forward only a little way. As a result of this\r\nrepeated dumping, an embankment forms, broadening seaward in the middle\r\nand bending shoreward at the ends. A portion of the sea itself is\r\nfinally cut out and enclosed by this embankment, thus forming a lagoon.\r\nFinally this lagoon is filled with material, washed from the land and\r\nby sediment brought in from the sea at high tide. Human engineers,\r\ntaking the hint, now put the sea to work on similar undertakings of\r\ntheir own. An embankment is built enclosing an area of the sea; then\r\nthe tides and the land wash do the rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DROWNED RIVERS THAT HELPED MAKE ENGLAND GREAT\r\n\r\n  Her fine harbors have helped to make England the great commercial\r\n  nation that she is. Notice here the relation of her largest cities\r\n  to the bay-like mouths of the drowned rivers and to the drowned\r\n  valley north of the Isle of Wight.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THE SEA TAUGHT SHORE ENGINEERING TO MEN\r\n\r\n  This is a salt marsh at mid-tide. How the sea itself adds such\r\n  regions to the dominion of the land, and how human engineers,\r\n  taking the hint, have put the sea to work, you will learn in this\r\n  chapter.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe sea also works with the busy little corals in building reefs\r\nand islands. Corals can only live and build where the water is kept\r\nin constant and vigorous motion by current and wave. From the air\r\nimprisoned in the bubbles by the stirring and turmoil of the waves and\r\nparticularly from the air in the white foam of the crests these little\r\npeople get their oxygen. At the same time they absorb out of the water\r\nthe food on which they grow. The sea not only feeds these little wards\r\nof its bounty during their busy lives, but extends their usefulness\r\nafter death, either by cementing to the reef the coral, ground up by\r\nthe waves, or in storms scattering it over wide areas, to be made\r\nlater into the finest of limestone; and still later into the best of\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FATHER NEPTUNE FEEDING THE CORAL PEOPLE\r\n\r\n  See that line of breakers just below the horizon? That shows where\r\n  Father Neptune is serving the little coral people with food and\r\n  fresh air, as explained in the text.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe know also that the sea makes coal as well as stone in its rock\r\nmills; that the pressure of the overlying rock was in large part the\r\nsource of the heat that changed the vegetation of the swamps, first\r\ninto charcoal and then into coal.\r\n\r\nThe subject of what the sea has done and is doing for us is almost\r\nas endless as the seas themselves; and no doubt the reason the sea\r\nis never still is because it has so much to do. Nothing in earth's\r\nanimate or inanimate nature exercises an influence to be compared in\r\nimportance to that of the sea, not only upon the land, but upon the\r\nwhole life which land and sea support; and even in what seem to be the\r\nmost aimless of its movements it in reality acts with the precision of\r\na machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Artist\r\n\r\nAnd in the making of the rock in its presses under the water, as\r\nwell as in the grinding which takes place along the shores, the sea\r\nevidently has an eye to beauty as well as use. As originally formed,\r\nthe conglomerates or \"pudding-stones\" are always laid nearest the shore\r\nbecause there the retiring waves and the rivers emptying into the sea\r\ndrop the heaviest part of their load, including the pebbles. Next is\r\ndropped the sand which is pressed into sandstone and beyond this the\r\nfinest particles of all, the ground-up soil, which becomes slate rock.\r\nStill beyond the zone of slate is deposited the lime from the shells\r\nof sea creatures who can live only in this clearer water, away from\r\nthe muddy waters nearer the shore. These deposits make limestone. The\r\nresult of this natural sorting process is that all the four kinds of\r\nsedimentary rock are always laid down in just this 1, 2, 3, 4 order and\r\nno other: (1) pudding-stone; (2) sandstone; (3) slate; (4) limestone.\r\n\r\nThen, as a result of the transgressions of the sea, what was once\r\na region of conglomerate may be later found far out under the sea\r\nand there is thus laid down over the conglomerate beds, strata of\r\nsandstone, slate, or limestone, depending on how far the sea advances.\r\nSo we find rocks with all sorts of neighbors above and below; limestone\r\nabove conglomerate, conglomerate above slate. These changes take place\r\nover vast regions and from the original uniformity in the arrangement\r\nof the rocks there necessarily results a similar uniformity in the\r\nresults of this \"shuffling,\" and no matter what changes may be made\r\nafterward by raising them up into shore cliff and mountain and by\r\nother earth movements, and by the endless reshaping by weather and\r\nwave, there still remains that underlying harmony which, with variety,\r\ngives to rocky shores their picturesque beauty.\r\n\r\nHarmony and variety are necessary in all forms of art--pictures,\r\nliterature, music--and the conditions governing harmony and variety are\r\nalways found hand-in-hand in the art work of the sea and its helpers.\r\nThe difference in texture in different kinds of rock, for example, and\r\nin different parts of the same rock, cause them to yield in different\r\nways and degrees to the action of wave, wind and weather; so there is\r\nsure to be great variety in the shapes they take as they are worn away.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARMONY, VARIETY, AND THE ART WORK OF THE SEA FAMILY LIKENESS IN ROCK\r\nFORMS\r\n\r\nYet, with all their differences, the shapes rocks take--sandstone\r\ncompared with granite, for example--are so characteristic that one soon\r\nlearns to tell a long way off what kind of rock a distant landscape\r\nis made of. There is inevitably a certain type resemblance, since all\r\nsandstone is of the same general texture and weathers in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE'S BUILDING BLOCKS AND THE SEA\r\n\r\nThen take the natural division into blocks made by joints in the rocks\r\nto which cliffs like the famous Castle Head at Bar Harbor owes its\r\nstriking form. These blocks are so nearly true that you feel sure they\r\nmust have been cut by stone-masons, and yet they have the variety which\r\nart demands; they have not the monotonous sameness of shape of the\r\nbricks in a wall. This is mainly due to the differences in the strains\r\nwhich cracked the original rock mass. So, from the beginning a sea-wall\r\nbuilt by nature is more picturesque than a sea-wall built by man. And\r\nit goes on taking more and more picturesque shapes under the hammers of\r\nthe waves. For the force of the waves, the angles at which they strike,\r\nthe size and shape of the rock fragments with which they strike, these\r\nvary infinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\nETCHING, SCULPTURE, AND LANDSCAPE GARDENING\r\n\r\nEqually true is this of other natural forces that shape the rocks;\r\nsuch as the daily and seasonal changes of temperature that chip away\r\nthe mountain peaks and the faces of the cliffs, and the character and\r\nnumber of plants that grow on rocks where they can get a foothold and\r\ndying and decaying generate acids which help to etch the rocks away.\r\nTrees growing on rocks search out the cracks with their roots and,\r\npushing in and prying them apart, help to change their form. And there\r\nis sure to be variety in the arrangement of the wild trees growing on\r\nrocks in the mountains and by the sea, since the seeds, being carried\r\nby the winds or by running water or by birds or four-footed creatures,\r\nfall in an endless variety of groupings. So of the shadows cast by the\r\ntrees. These shadow masses, so different in shape, owing in part to\r\nthe irregular arrangement of the trees and in part to the differences\r\nin shape of the trees themselves, protect portions of the rock, to a\r\ncertain extent, against changes in temperature, while the bare rocks\r\nare fully exposed to it, so there results a corresponding variety in\r\nthe result of the sun's work upon the rock. At the same time they help\r\non the acid etching process, because in these shadowed spots there is\r\nmore moisture and therefore more rapid decay.\r\n\r\nThe form of whole continents follows the same law. Take, for example,\r\nEurope. \"The geological history of Europe,\" says Geikie,[49] \"is\r\nlargely the history of its mountain chains\"; and the mountain chains,\r\nfor all their picturesque variety, have also, and necessarily, a\r\ncertain uniformity, because in the wrinkling of the rocks which made\r\nthem the vast areas over which they now extend were all subjected to\r\nthe same force--a big push from one side which crumpled up the earth's\r\nouter crust as a table-cloth is crumpled up when pushed forward against\r\na book lying on it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Encyclopædia Britannica: article on Geology.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE VERY SCENERY PLAYS MANY PARTS\r\n\r\nThe ancient history written in the rocks, in the present relative\r\npositions of the strata, shows that four times a great mountain system\r\nhas thus been raised across the face of what is now Europe; that three\r\ntimes large portions of these mountain ranges have been sunk under\r\nthe sea and new rocks deposited over them; and that the mountains of\r\nto-day--the Alps, the Carpathians, and the rest--are the survivors of\r\nthe fourth time up. Here we have another striking example of the fact\r\nthat on the great stage of life the very scenery has its exits and its\r\nentrances!\r\n\r\nBut remember that in all these changes of scenery--in the crumplings\r\nand the foldings, and new rock deposits and the carving by the rivers\r\nand the frosts and the winds and the waves of the sea--we have certain\r\nsimilar materials, similarly arranged, stretching over vast areas, and\r\nthe consequence is a certain uniformity and rhythm in the ups and downs\r\nof the landscape and in the changes worked in the walls of stone \"where\r\ntime and storm have set their wild signatures upon them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  What would you think of seeing the leaves all out and the trees in\r\n  bloom on Christmas Day? That happens right along, and the people\r\n  who live in the lands where this occurs don't think anything of\r\n  it, because this is in the Southern Hemisphere during the vacation\r\n  season of the sea.\r\n\r\n  One peculiar thing about this spring and summer in the winter time\r\n  in Africa is that when the leaves first come out they are not\r\n  green at all. They are brown, red, and pink. Later on they turn\r\n  green--just as any well-behaved leaf is supposed to do.[50] It's as\r\n  if they got mixed in their dates and thought at first it was autumn\r\n  and then woke up and said:\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, yes, to be sure, this is spring! What are we thinking about?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Livingstone's \"Expedition to the Zambesi.\"]\r\n\r\n  Anyhow they turn from the autumn browns and reds to the appropriate\r\n  green of spring, and the flowers come out and the birds begin to\r\n  sing in the very season when our winter winds are loudest and the\r\n  rock mills of the sea are roaring at their work.\r\n\r\n  In which Hemisphere, the Northern or the Southern, do the sea mills\r\n  have most land to work on?\r\n\r\n  In Shakespere's \"Tempest\" you will find a description of a storm at\r\n  sea that will take your breath away. Almost the whole of Scene 2,\r\n  Act I, is in that terrible storm. In fact, the whole play, as the\r\n  title of it indicates, is full of storm.\r\n\r\n  While you are looking for storms in Shakespere see what you can\r\n  find in \"Two Gentlemen of Verona,\" \"Twelfth Night,\" \"Midsummer\r\n  Night's Dream,\" and \"The Merchant of Venice.\"\r\n\r\n  Speaking of the sea still being in the Stone Age what do you know\r\n  about the kind of tools man used in the Stone Age and how he got\r\n  along?[51]\r\n\r\n  (You'll find that the story of the development of man, as dealt\r\n  with in connection with the Stone Age, is part of the strangest\r\n  story of all the strange stories of science. You will get a brief\r\n  outline of it in this story of mine, in the last chapter.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Interesting books on this subject are: Starr's \"First\r\nSteps in Human Progress\" (Chautauqua Reading Course) and Clodd's\r\n\"Childhood of the World.\" Osborn's \"The Men of the Old Stone Age\" is\r\nthe latest and most comprehensive work on the subject.]\r\n\r\n  How much more do you know about pneumatic tools than Father Neptune\r\n  does? No doubt you've used a \"pneumatic\" tool of a sort yourself\r\n  more than once--a tool for making a noise. Guess what. A pop-gun!\r\n  Look up _pneumatic tools_, and you will find that the same thing\r\n  that makes the pop-gun pop helps to build skyscrapers, locomotives,\r\n  and steamships, and do a lot of other wonderful things.\r\n\r\n  In connection with the water wedges made by the sea you must\r\n  remember that curious trick ice has when it freezes (page 154);\r\n  otherwise you can't understand how it could act like a wedge.\r\n\r\n  Yes, and wedges, simple as they look, are almost as wonderful as\r\n  levers; and you know what Archimedes said he could do with a lever.\r\n\r\n  The whole subject of machinery and particularly of \"automatic\" or\r\n  so-called self-acting machinery[52] is fascinating. Find out about\r\n  planing mills and how they work, particularly why they stop planing\r\n  just when they are told to.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: As a matter of fact, the only machinery that is really\r\nautomatic is the machinery of nature, of which what we have called \"the\r\nmachinery of the sea\" is an example.]\r\n\r\n  In connection with how the sea sometimes helps make harbors\r\n  think of as many great harbors as you can, and then look on your\r\n  geography map and see how many you have missed.\r\n\r\n  What character in \"Titus Andronicus\" says that about the man\r\n  standing on a rock and watching the sea come to eat him up?\r\n\r\n  Your geography has a good deal to say about continental shelves;\r\n  and with pictures. Do you remember?\r\n\r\n  Speaking of lands sinking under the sea you'll run into a world\r\n  of interesting things if you look up the story of the Lost Island\r\n  of Atlantis; about the Egyptian priest who first described it to\r\n  Solon, the Greek lawgiver, as an earthly paradise where all the\r\n  laws and everything else were just right.\r\n\r\n  And if you're of High School age you'll enjoy reading what\r\n  Plato[53] and Homer[54] say about this ideal land.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Timæus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: The Odyssey.]\r\n\r\n  Isn't it a striking thing how the big sea that can look so fierce\r\n  takes such tender care of the little coral people? And what\r\n  extraordinary folks these coral people are! Any good article about\r\n  them will tell you worlds of interesting things. For instance, you\r\n  will find the people of whole villages living together with only\r\n  one backbone. I mean not one backbone _apiece_ but one backbone\r\n  among them _all_!\r\n\r\n  And they have the queerest way with their stomachs, a kind of\r\n  co-operative digestion, of co-operative housekeeping. (Your\r\n  mother will be particularly interested in this because it shows\r\n  the \"community kitchen\" idea has been thoroughly tried out and it\r\n  works! If you don't know about \"community kitchens\" among human\r\n  housekeepers ask mother to tell you, and then you tell _her_ what\r\n  you found out about these strange little housekeepers of the sea.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                              (NOVEMBER)\r\n\r\n  It is a noble thing for men ... to make the face of a wall look\r\n  infinite, and its edge against the sky like an horizon; or even\r\n  if less than this be reached, it is still delightful to mark the\r\n  play of passing light on its broad surface, and to see by how many\r\n  artifices and gradations of tinting and shadow, time and storm will\r\n  set their wild signatures upon it.\r\n\r\n                         --_Ruskin_: _The Seven Lamps of Architecture_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HANDWRITING ON THE WALLS\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting things in this whole wonderful story of the\r\nlife history of the world is how men were first able to read it at all.\r\nFor we know they didn't find it written out in plain print as we have\r\nit now. Neither was it told in any one language so that getting hold of\r\nthe thread of the story they could unravel it all, as other learned men\r\ndid the picture writing of the Egyptians and the wedge-shaped marks on\r\nAssyrian bricks.\r\n\r\nWe know already how they learned that rivers open their own gateways\r\nthrough the mountains; how they know rocks are made over in the\r\nfairyland of change; how they know the ancient glaciers scattered\r\nthe boulders over mountainside, valley, and field; how they know the\r\nmountains are children of the sea.\r\n\r\nAll this and more we have been reading in the written language of the\r\nrocks, but there are other things in this rock script that I have kept\r\nfor this last but one of our pleasant talks, so that they might serve\r\nas a kind of summary and remembrance of all that has gone before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WALL THAT VULCAN BUILT\r\n\r\n  I've said it several times before, but I can't help saying it here\r\n  again, how much more wonderful the ways of Nature are than was ever\r\n  dreamed of even in the wonder tales of the Greeks! Take this great\r\n  iron wall, for example--a wall of the iron rock called \"lava\"--and\r\n  who would suppose that it was made by natural forces? It was driven\r\n  in a molten state into a crack in overlying rock. After it cooled,\r\n  the rock above and on either side of it, being of softer material,\r\n  was worn away. This wall is near Spanish Peaks, Colorado. It is 100\r\n  feet high and some 30 feet wide. Colorado boys, on their vacations\r\n  in that region, run along the top of it for miles.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Mysteries in Marble Walls\r\n\r\nTake a piece of marble for example, such as you see along the walls of\r\nour great modern buildings. There's a story for you! Why, if half the\r\nthings it tells had just happened, or even just been discovered by some\r\nenterprising reporter, we should see pages and pages about it all in\r\nevery newspaper in the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MARBLE RETELLS THE WORLD HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn that piece of marble alone you have a pretty full review of the\r\nearth's history; of many of the most important things we have seen and\r\nheard about since we all started out together in Chapter I. It tells of\r\nstrange life in ancient seas; of being buried deep in the earth under\r\nimmense pressure, and where it could feel the intense heat of the rock\r\nat the centre, and of coming up again completely changed; transformed\r\nfrom the substance of a dead sea creature's shell to a crystallized\r\nstone beautifully colored and of many patterns; of the chemistry of the\r\nworld underground and the laboratories in which its lovely coloring\r\nwere made and blended; and solid rock threaded through rock with a\r\nskill that no worker in mosaic has ever equalled; drawn out and fixed\r\nin mere films of white, fading into the rich dark of the marble around\r\nthem like white clouds shredded by the winds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STRANGE STORIES THAT MARBLE TELLS]\r\n\r\nThose broader lines bending and turning, rising and falling, tell of\r\nthe work of the giant forces that lift the mountains into place and\r\nof the great earthquakes that accompany mountain building. When those\r\nlittle quavering lines were being made, away down in the earth where\r\nthe limestone changed to marble, mountains were slowly rising into the\r\nsky on the earth's surface far above. The quaverings in the marble are\r\npictures, \"line drawings\" of the mountain story. And beside these lines\r\nthat you can read so plainly there are others so small that you need a\r\nmagnifying glass to see them; echoes, away down in the fairyland of the\r\nmicroscope, of the doings of the giants of Mountainland far above.\r\n\r\nIn following the lines of the earth's great walls of rock over a wide\r\nextent they are found waving sharply up and down in one section, rising\r\nand falling like ocean swells in another, in forward sloping folds in\r\nanother, and sometimes even with folds doubling over, as if the great\r\nmountains which these folds made were trying to stand on their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY LINES IN MARBLE REPEAT MOUNTAIN FORMS\r\n\r\nAll these rock folds which, with the help of the sculpturing of the\r\nelements, produce the infinite variety of beauty in mountain scenery\r\nare, speaking generally, repeated in the lines of the marble. But they\r\nare repeated only in miniature, because the rocks deep in the earth are\r\nunder such pressure that while the rocks on the surface are free to\r\nrise in big and comparatively simple waves those beneath are doubled up\r\ninto smaller and much more crumpled folds. Take several sheets of paper\r\nlying free on the table and press them from the ends. They will rise\r\nin simple arches as most mountains do. Now lay a book on these sheets\r\nand press from the ends again. You see they crumple up a great deal\r\nmore; the larger wrinkles themselves doubling into smaller ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW MOTHER NATURE MAKES HER Z'S\r\n\r\n  These Z-shaped rock folds were made by the crumpling up of the\r\n  crust as the centre, cooling, shrank away. They are to be seen near\r\n  the east end of Ogden Canyon, Utah. The black lines were added to\r\n  the photograph in the offices of Uncle Sam's big department of\r\n  geology at Washington, to show clearly just where the rock runs.\r\n]\r\n\r\nYou may often have noticed a banded effect in marble. My, what power\r\nit took to do that! Pressure we can't realize. Pressure from above so\r\ngreat that it made this marble spread; moulded it like clay in the\r\nhands of the potter; the same kind of force that flattened out the\r\npebbles referred to in Chapter V. This is called \"rock flow,\" and how\r\nplainly the marble shows the flowing movement. I always think what the\r\nweather people call \"stratus\" clouds, look as if they were made by long\r\nstrokes of a painter's brush; and this marble has the very same flowing\r\nlines. Such cloud pictures in marble are made where deposits of other\r\nkinds of rock have been interlaid with the deposits of limestone which\r\nafterward changed to marble, and it is where these bands are folded or\r\nbent that we have set down for us the story of the mountain folds.\r\n\r\nThose gossamer effects and the little white clouds spinning out and\r\nfading into the general mass of the marble, how delicate they are!\r\nYet it took a force that made the earth quake to put them there. The\r\nmore we know of the strange and fearful things that happen in times of\r\nearthquake the more we can read between these filmy lines. They tell of\r\nthe sides of mountains tumbling down and spreading their valleys with a\r\nchaos of broken stone; making cliffs where there were peaks and peaks\r\nwhere there were cliffs; changing the course of rivers; shifting whole\r\nforests on the mountainside and replacing them with grim walls and\r\nbastions of barren stone--all in the twinkling of an eye!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARTHQUAKES AND THE DELICATE FILMS\r\n\r\nIt is by the crushing movements that made the earthquake that rocks are\r\nbroken into confusions of cracks such as you often see in a thick glass\r\nwindow that has been broken. Then into these cracks come dissolved\r\nminerals from other rocks and harden into stone. In the marble one set\r\nof veins often runs right through another as if they had been inlaid.\r\nThen there may be other veins that cross both of these--no end of\r\ncriss-crossings. The different sets of veins usually differ also in\r\ncolor and in grain, and even have different kinds of mineral in them.\r\nWith a good hand-glass you can see this difference in texture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE TAKES ITS PEN IN HAND\r\n\r\n  These are, so to speak, the autographs of earthquakes--the\r\n  records earthquakes themselves make on an instrument called the\r\n  \"seismograph,\" using a stylus, as the ancients did, as you will\r\n  see by looking up \"seismograph\" in the dictionary or encyclopædia.\r\n  After an earthquake starts it seems to stop for breath or for want\r\n  of the right word--just like people; for you notice portions of the\r\n  lines are almost straight. These were made when the earthquake was\r\n  comparatively quiet. Then, when it got excited again--as in the\r\n  second record from the top--the stylus fairly jumped up and down;\r\n  and there where the waves are long and close together the shocks\r\n  were particularly severe and followed each other rapidly.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. How Vulcan Drove his Autograph into the Rocks\r\n\r\nBut there is another kind of handwriting on the walls that was made\r\nwith such a vigorous stroke that it also made the earth shake. Of\r\ncourse we might expect Vulcan to write a rather vigorous hand--Vulcan,\r\nforger of thunderbolts for Jove. The ancients thought volcanoes\r\nbelonged to the kingdom of Vulcan, so in scientific language everything\r\nconnected with volcanic action comes under the head of \"Vulcanism.\"\r\nThese queer letters we are talking about are called \"dikes.\" They are\r\nmade of lava that was driven into cracks in the rocks and afterward\r\ncooled into rock that is as hard as iron. Lava is often largely made of\r\niron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. VULCAN'S FAMOUS CASTLE ON THE HUDSON\r\n\r\n  This is a part of Mr. Vulcan's famous castle on the Hudson known\r\n  as the Palisades. Here the lava rock has formed into columns which\r\n  make the mass look all the more like some old castle of the Middle\r\n  Ages. The \"windows\" are where the softer spots in the rock have\r\n  decayed away. This castle--come to think of it--really belongs\r\n  to mediæval architecture, for it was built in the Middle Ages of\r\n  earth's long history.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIS IS THE HAND OF VULCAN, TOO]\r\n\r\nWere you ever down by the seashore in a storm? If so you remember\r\nhow the ground under your feet shook when a great wave rushed into\r\nsome narrow passage or crevice in the rocks, and was tossed high in\r\nthe air in spray. Then just imagine molten lava, which is many times\r\nheavier than water, driven into a crack in a rock with the force of a\r\ncannon-ball. That's how it happened. That's how those dark strokes in\r\nthe rock with their heavy shading were made.\r\n\r\nThis was done in the depths of the earth; not on the surface where you\r\nsee these rocks now. They used to have piles of other rocks above\r\nthem, but these in course of time have been weathered away. This is\r\nknown, not only from the marks of the wearing but from the fact that\r\nthese dikes, as well as the rock into which they have been driven, are\r\ncrystallized, wholly or in part. Such crystallizing, as we know, takes\r\nplace away down in the earth.\r\n\r\nDikes are very common. In some places you find the rocks fairly laced\r\nwith them. The picture of the dikes in the granite shores at Marblehead\r\nalso shows (in the horizontal plan) many \"faults\" or slips of the\r\nrock since the dike was made, and each slip probably gave rise to an\r\nearthquake. So you see there's the story of a terrible time written on\r\nthose quiet old residents by the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GIANT'S CAUSEWAY\r\n\r\n  Here is a still more striking example of the formation of columns\r\n  in lava--the Giant's Causeway. Here are 40,000 columns, packed\r\n  like the cells of a honeycomb, and they slope to the pavement in\r\n  the foreground that gives the mass its name. That bees should make\r\n  their little honey-jars in such regular form is wonderful enough,\r\n  but think of lava shaping its own self into columns like that!\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nDID MR. VULCAN USE A STEAM PILE-DRIVER?\r\n\r\nJust what power Mr. Vulcan used to drive the dikes is not known for\r\nsure, but I'll tell you how it is supposed to have been done. Remember\r\nthat all rocks that are deep down in the earth contain water, shut up\r\nin their pores. Then remember how hot it is down there and how this\r\nheat would make steam right in the rocks. Then let the rock above be\r\ncracked by the movements of the earth crust, and this crack extend down\r\nto where these hot rocks are, the pressure, being released along that\r\ncrack, the melted rock (lava) would rush up, as it does in connection\r\nwith the eruptions of volcanoes, and the exploding steam would help\r\ndrive it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Ancient Weather Records Turned to Stone\r\n\r\nSo much for the literary remains of Mr. Vulcan. Now let's see how much\r\nwe can make out of the handwriting of the waters and the winds on these\r\nwalls of time.\r\n\r\nWhat does the picture at the top of page 245 look like? Rain-drops in\r\nthe dust. And so you see they are; but the rain fell so long that the\r\npits made in the dust have turned to stone. Think of the autograph of\r\na rain-drop older than the Pharaohs; older than the pyramids these\r\nPharaohs built to perpetuate their names.\r\n\r\nAnd this is how such rain-drops immortalize themselves; this is the\r\ninterpretation of their handwriting on the walls. Along the dry shore\r\nof an ancient sea when the tide was out, rain-drops fell on the sand\r\nand dust. Tides often come in with a rush, in wild waves driven by\r\nthe wind, but when there is no wind and no waves rolling in from far\r\ndistant storms the tide may overspread such delicate things as the\r\nimprint of rain-drops with a thin protecting film of mud. This was what\r\nhappened to our little rain pits. Later tides overlaid them deeper\r\nfrom day to day, and in course of time both the layer containing the\r\nrain-drop prints and the overlying layers of sediment turned to stone.\r\nOften the heat of a summer sun will bake these rain-drop designs and\r\nthis you see helps; it holds the impression until the tide can come in\r\nand spread its protecting film. Many imprints of rain-drops and of the\r\nfeet of reptiles are found in the sandstone underlying the coal seams\r\nin eastern Pennsylvania, and they are always, I am told, covered with\r\na fine powdery material, which was once the slime and mud of the tide.\r\nSuch rain marks are often found also in slate. Wouldn't you like to\r\nhave a slate with one of these rain-drop autographs on it?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAIN-DROP AUTOGRAPHS OLDER THAN THE PHARAOHS]\r\n\r\nHere, by the way, is a very important thing these rain-drops tell. Says\r\nProfessor Shaler:\r\n\r\n\"They tell us that the ordinary machinery of the atmosphere was\r\noperating in those days very much as it is to-day, and that the climate\r\nwas much the same.\"[55]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: This quotation is from Doctor Shaler's \"Nature and Man in\r\nAmerica,\" a book you should read, as you should all of Doctor Shaler's\r\nbooks. No one has observed so many interesting things in the field of\r\ngeology and few have written about them so simply or reasoned about\r\nthem so well.]\r\n\r\nSo, he argues, the great Ice Age couldn't have been due to change of\r\nclimate, but to the other things that we read about in Chapter II. For\r\nthey even know in what ages different records of rain-drops were made\r\nbecause they are found in rocks laid down in different periods; and one\r\nof the periods in which they are found was that in which the North Pole\r\nice and its neighbors came down and made us those long visits.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORY OF A STROLL IN THE RAIN\r\n\r\nAnother story found in museums is written in slate--not by a rain-drop\r\nbut by a living creature. The slate shows the track of a reptile with\r\nfeet like a bird. Evidently he was strolling along in the rain; for\r\nthere you see the marks of the rain-drops right among the marks of his\r\nfeet, and in the footprints themselves. Being a reptile who spent much\r\nof his time in or near the water he no doubt enjoyed these little pats\r\nof the rain-drops as he went along.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT THIS STROLL WAS TAKEN IN THE SUN\r\n\r\nIn another of these museum specimens we see written out just as plainly\r\nthe story of a stroll in the sun. There are the imprints of Mr.\r\nReptile's feet, and there are the sun-cracks in the mud showing that\r\nthe sun was shining--or at least that it had been shining for several\r\ndays or weeks, for it takes a little time to make sun-cracks in mud.\r\nThis story, we might suppose, was written so that it could be read\r\nby the blind; the cracks, as well as the footprints, are brought out\r\nin raised lettering. Sun-cracked mud, after a long dry \"spell,\" will\r\nbake so that the cracks will not be washed out by the returning tide\r\nbut instead be filled by other material, and this material will go on\r\nbuilding up to a certain extent; so making those ridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THEN THERE CAME A LONG DRY SPELL\"\r\n\r\n  This shows how the cracks in dried-up mud are preserved in stone.\r\n  The process is the same as in the case of the stone imprints of\r\n  rain-drops, the imprints being protected by successive deposits of\r\n  mud by quiet tides, and afterward turning to stone.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STONE AUTOGRAPHS OF GENTLE BREEZES\r\n\r\nOn still other stones you will find written the story of gentle breezes\r\nthat stirred the water and made ripples on long-buried shores. First\r\nthe breezes rippled the shallow waters near the shore. Then the waters\r\nrippled the sand, and the sediments of the tide preserved these ripple\r\nmarks as they did the rain-drops and the footprints.\r\n\r\nBut the wind alone, without the help of water ripples, can write its\r\nname in the sands of time. And when you get to know the handwriting\r\nof wind and wave you will not mistake the one for the other. You are\r\nlikely to find wind ripples on any big heap of sand. Have a good look\r\nat them and then go down to shallow water on a sandy shore and compare\r\nthe two kinds. That's the way the great men of science do; they notice\r\nevery little thing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From Norton's \"Elements of Geology.\"\r\n   By permission of Ginn and Company_\r\n\r\n            THE STORY OF BIG ROUND TOP AND LITTLE ROUND TOP\r\n\r\n  One story of Big Round Top and Little Round Top your history tells,\r\n  but long before the battle of Gettysburg these two mountains had\r\n  age-long battles of their own with the winds, the rains, and the\r\n  frosts, and in these battles lost their peaks and their sharp\r\n  outlines of jagged rock, and became rounded down to the forms we\r\n  see before us. Those rocks in the field were probably broken off\r\n  in these battles, as the rocks of high mountains are to-day, and\r\n  carried down by roaring torrents.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nWEATHER RECORDS ON THE MOUNTAIN WALLS\r\n\r\nFrom a scientific standpoint little things may be just as big as big\r\nthings. For example, in this matter of old weather records these\r\nrain-drops and ripple stones are just as interesting as other weather\r\nrecords written large on mountain walls; such as those which tell that\r\nwhat is now the Dead Sea was once part of a much larger sea that wasn't\r\ndead at all. You may never get to read these records on the mountain\r\nwalls of Palestine, for they are a long way off, but here in our own\r\ncountry we have a similar story told on mountain walls in the region\r\nof another dead sea--the Great Salt Lake of Utah. From Salt Lake City\r\nyou can see on the mountain surrounding the desert of the Great Basin\r\nthe marks of old shore lines; where the waves cut into the rock. These\r\nmarks show that this Basin once held two great lakes, and the one in\r\nthe eastern portion dried up into what is now Great Salt Lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEATHER RECORDS ON THE WALLS OF TIME\r\n\r\n  What is now the Great Salt Lake used to be a much greater lake that\r\n  wasn't salt at all. That vast flight of steps up the mountainside\r\n  shows how wide it spread. As the big lake dried up, and grew\r\n  smaller and smaller and saltier and saltier, its shores were\r\n  bounded successively by those wave-cut cliffs.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Stories Written on the Pebbles\r\n\r\nSometimes when a geologist picks up a pebble and looks at it a moment\r\nhe can hear the roar of mountain torrents and of lowland streams in\r\nflood. If the pebble is round it shows that it has been carried far and\r\nrolled about by streams. If it has pits in it this shows that its water\r\njourneys were rough, because such pits are made by knocking against\r\nother pebbles and sharp stones in the struggle and confusion of the\r\nrushing waters. You see these little dots are a kind of shorthand, for\r\nwe pebbles are stenographers too!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PERCHED BOULDER IN BRONX PARK\r\n\r\n  This is one of the interesting things to be seen when you visit\r\n  Bronx Park in New York City. Of course, _you_ know how that old\r\n  boulder got there, and how he drew those straight lines in the\r\n  rock-bed beneath, but many visitors to the park do not.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW PEBBLES TELL OF THEIR TRAVELS\r\n\r\nOther great stories in small space are told on glacial pebbles.\r\nScientific men can often tell from the look of a pebble whether it was\r\nshaped by rivers, by the sea, by the sand blasts of desert winds, or\r\nby the glaciers. Not only that, but, if it is a glaciated pebble, on\r\nwhat part of the glacier it was carried; whether in the middle of its\r\nback, or on the sides, like the passengers in an Irish jaunting-car;\r\nor whether it rode underneath, like a tramp stealing a ride on the\r\nbumpers. The stones in the middle of the glacier's back naturally keep\r\ntheir sharp edges longer than stones on the side, ground as the side\r\nstones are by the moving ice mass against the mountain walls. And the\r\nstones on both top and sides would lose less of their edges than the\r\nstones underneath the ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From Norton's \"Elements of Geology.\"\r\n   By permission of Ginn and Company_\r\n\r\n                ONE PEBBLE IN ITS TIME PLAYS MANY PARTS\r\n\r\n  Here are pebbles faceted in different ways by glaciers. No. 1 has\r\n  six facets. No. 4, originally a rounded river pebble, has been\r\n  rubbed down to one flat face. Nos. 3 and 5 are battered little\r\n  travellers faceted on one side only. Notice how No. 5 got his face\r\n  scratched just as I did.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEBBLE FACETED BY WIND-BLOWN SAND\r\n\r\n  You remember how the glaciers ground flat faces or facets on the\r\n  pebbles, don't you? Here is another example of Nature's lapidary\r\n  work, but here she has used wind and sand instead of ice.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. A Greater Cæsar and His Commentaries\r\n\r\nWell, there he is again, you see, Mr. Glacier of the Ice Age. He's\r\nalways turning up, everywhere you go in earth history. As Shakespere's\r\nMr. Cassius said of Mr. Julius Cæsar, \"he bestrode the world.\" And,\r\nlike the Roman Cæsar, this Cæsar wrote the story of his own exploits;\r\nbut although a vastly greater conqueror than the famous Roman, he was\r\neven more modest. Cæsar and his Commentaries, our High School friend\r\nwill tell you, nearly always refers to himself in the third person;\r\nbut in his commentaries on his travels and exploits the Old Man of the\r\nMountain didn't even use his own name. He left the editors of his\r\nmanuscript to find out who he was.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE GREAT LAKES WERE TIPPED UP\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking things he did, of which he wrote the record on\r\nthe walls, was to tip up the Great Lakes. You remember just how he made\r\nthem. Well, it seems that as he started back home he tipped them up.\r\nSuppose you could pick up the vast stone bowls that hold these lakes\r\nand tip them toward the north as easily as you can tip a bowl of water,\r\nwhat would the water do? It would fall lower along the south shores of\r\nthe lakes and rise along the northern shores, wouldn't it? Then suppose\r\nthe lakes were kept tipped up in this way for ages, and summer wind\r\nstorms and winter tempests dashed waves against their shores, what\r\nwould happen? Stone walls rising above the shore would have terraces\r\ncut into them, and the line of these terraces would tilt toward the\r\nnorth. There are terraces just like that on rocks bordering the Great\r\nLakes, and the explanation of their tilt is that the lakes themselves\r\nwere tipped up, and that the Old Man of the Mountain did the tipping.\r\nThe rock crust of the round earth bends under great weight like an\r\narch. So when the enormous weight of the glaciers of the Ice Age was on\r\na portion of the arch it bent down. Then, as the glaciers retreated,\r\nthe weight of them was shifted northward all the time. Finally when\r\nthe glaciers in the region of the lakes had melted quite away the arch\r\nslowly rose into place again and lifted the terraces above the water\r\nline as we see them to-day.\r\n\r\nThroughout regions the glaciers visited you find rocks polished like\r\nmirrors; in other cases they are scratched, and in others deeply\r\ngrooved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE ON THE COAST OF NORWAY BY A GLACIER\r\n\r\n  You know the fiords. You've met them in your geography. This is\r\n  a fiord on the Norway coast. Notice how smooth the walls of the\r\n  mountains are. They were trimmed down by the ice, which also plowed\r\n  off their soil. We are here looking up what was once a river\r\n  valley, but the glacier cut it down below sea level, and this is\r\n  sea water. Notice in the openings of the mountains all the way up\r\n  the valley where the tributaries of the ancient river flowed in\r\n  then as now.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THIS MR. CÆSAR IS TRANSLATED\r\n\r\nNo one scratch can be followed far. The composition is, like Cæsar's,\r\nin short sentences, whole episodes in a word: \"Veni, vidi, vici.\" But a\r\nseries of scratches all run in one general direction--north and south.\r\nTo get at the meaning--just as in construing Cæsar--you must take the\r\ncontext; what goes before and after.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the valleys of the Alps from 1,000 to 2,000 feet above\r\nthe surface of the glaciers of our own time are scratched and furrowed\r\nin the same way. Here we catch Mr. Glacier almost in the very act of\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HANDWRITING OF THE TWO CÆSARS\r\n\r\nTo do this writing, our Cæsar, like the Cæsar of the High School,\r\nused a stylus. Mr. Glacier's stylus, as we know, was made of stone\r\nheld fast in his icy grip (page 121). And here is another curious\r\nresemblance between the manuscripts of Mr. G. Cæsar and Mr. J. Cæsar.\r\nThey both wrote in straight lines. The reason Julius Cæsar and other\r\nRoman gentlemen wrote in letters made of straight lines was that they\r\nscratched these letters on tablets covered with wax, using a sharpened\r\npiece of iron or ivory. You can see it would be much easier with such\r\nwriting tools and material to form letters in straight lines than to\r\nwrite in flowing, rounded and connected lines as we do so easily with a\r\nnice flexible pen on a smooth surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE OLD MEN CHANGED A \"V\" TO A \"U\"\r\n\r\nHere is something else about the story of the Old Men of the Mountain\r\nthat is a curious reminder of the Romans and their letters. The Romans\r\nhad no letter U in their alphabet and so V had to do a double duty;\r\nit had to be a V and then when asked, had to take its place in line\r\nand pretend to be a U. For instance, a Roman who wanted to write the\r\nword \"number\" would do it in this way: \"NVMERO.\" After a while, in the\r\nhistory of the growth of our alphabet, the V that was intended for U\r\nwas rounded at the bottom.\r\n\r\nNow, curiously enough, the writing of the Old Men of the Mountain has\r\ngone through the same process. River valleys in mountain regions, as\r\nelsewhere, are originally V-shaped, but where glaciers flowed down\r\nthese valleys they not only made them wider but rounded out the bottoms\r\nso that they became U-shaped. Look at the valley in the Wind River\r\nrange in Wyoming shown in the geologies. You notice the farther your\r\neye goes up into the mountains the more V-shaped the valley becomes.\r\nBack toward antiquity, you see, when they had nothing but V!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HANDWRITING OF THE GLACIERS AND THE ROMANS\r\n\r\n  Here is an interesting relic of ancient days that will enable you\r\n  to compare the chirography of the Old Men of the Mountain with that\r\n  of the Romans. These are marks left by the masons on Roman walls.\r\n  They show just what part each mason laid, so that if the wall\r\n  proved defective the authorities would know who was responsible.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAll quite striking, isn't it, this strange kind of writing on the walls\r\nof time? As if, among the ruins that are all there is left of the\r\nfallen Roman Empire, we should in some heap of dust and crumbled stone\r\nfind one of the very tablets on which Cæsar wrote his commentaries and\r\nthere engraved in Cæsar's own hand:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIS STYLE IS CALLED FLUTING\r\n\r\n  Looks like moulding, doesn't it? This is a piece of rock, and it\r\n  was carved in that way by the glaciers with their tools of embedded\r\n  stone. The deeper grooves were made where the rock was softer or\r\n  where the glacier's chisels were of a particularly hard quality,\r\n  such as flint or granite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\"Cæsar, maximis bellis confectis, in hiberna exercitum deduxit.\"\r\n\r\nCan you translate that for us? (This to the High School Boy.)\r\n\r\n\"As easy as anything,\" says he. \"Cæsar, on completion of these great\r\nwars, led his army into winter quarters.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that same phrase might serve in Mr. Glacier's Commentaries too.\r\nFor the glaciers of the Ice Age, after their great work was done, also\r\nwent into winter quarters; melting back to the present snow-line in our\r\nmountains and the regions of eternal ice around the pole.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  One of the most interesting stories of men's handwriting on the\r\n  walls and how scholars, many centuries afterward, learned to read\r\n  it, you will find in encyclopædias, histories, and other books\r\n  under such headings as _Egypt_, _Assyria_, _Rosetta Stone_, and\r\n  most of all under _Hieroglyphics_; a big word, but full of meat\r\n  when once you've cracked the shell.\r\n\r\n  Among other things, you will find that if it hadn't been for the\r\n  Egyptians and other clever people of the long ago we would not have\r\n  had our written language to read at all; on walls or anywhere else!\r\n\r\n  If you had been an Egyptian, say 4,000 years ago, how many letters\r\n  do you suppose you would have had to learn before you could have\r\n  read well? About a thousand! But it wouldn't have been so hard\r\n  as you think, for the Egyptian letters talked, so to speak. They\r\n  told their own story much as did the picture words that told so\r\n  much to the little Greeks. These Egyptian words, however--for they\r\n  were words, or several words in one, rather than letters--were\r\n  real pictures, and very good pictures, too. (See Chambers under\r\n  \"Hieroglyphics\" for the little pictures.)\r\n\r\n  Some of them were very simple. It wasn't hard to learn.\r\n\r\n  But now suppose you were an Egyptian and you wanted to write a\r\n  letter telling somebody how pleased you were about something--a\r\n  nice new book an uncle had sent you, for instance--the proper\r\n  picture-word to use would be a lady beating a tambourine. She is\r\n  pleased--that's why she is beating the tambourine, just as a small\r\n  boy claps his hands when he says, \"Oh, goody, goody!\" So this\r\n  picture-word came to be used to express \"joy\" or \"pleasure\" over\r\n  anything.\r\n\r\n  These are just some samples to show you what interesting things\r\n  even such formidable words as \"hieroglyphics\" are when you make\r\n  friends with them. But now, to get back to Nature's handwriting and\r\n  the nature myths connected with it, what do you know about this\r\n  Vulcan, who left so much of his manuscript in the rocks?\r\n\r\n  The ancients thought of him as a worker in metals. Don't you think\r\n  they would have, been quite sure of it if they had known about the\r\n  dikes and the palisades of the Hudson, and Fingal's cave, with\r\n  their remarkable iron-like columns of cooled lava? But he was an\r\n  artist in metals, too, and a mechanical engineer, it seems. Do you\r\n  remember about those two statues of beautiful women that he made\r\n  of pure gold, and how they walked about with him wherever he went?\r\n  And the brazen-footed bulls of Ætes, that filled the air with their\r\n  bellowings and from their nostrils blew flame and smoke?[56]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: I wonder if Vulcan could have been thinking of\r\nlocomotives--what we sometimes call \"iron horses\"--when he made those\r\nbulls. Do you suppose?]\r\n\r\n  The Greeks probably didn't know about such \"art metal\" work as\r\n  the palisades--certainly they didn't know about the Hudson River\r\n  or Fingal's Cave--but they had Vulcan (Hephæstus they called him)\r\n  doing all sorts of other art-metal things. There was the famous\r\n  shield he made for Achilles, for instance. Homer takes several\r\n  pages just to tell about the different figures on it and what they\r\n  meant.[57]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: The Iliad.]\r\n\r\n  Why do you suppose a temple was erected on Mount Etna? (What kind\r\n  of a mountain is it?)\r\n\r\n  Wouldn't it be strange if we could make hard coal out of soft?\r\n  Vulcan does that sometimes with these dike strokes of his.[58]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: The International Encyclopedia.]\r\n\r\n  The International will also tell you why dike rock is usually so\r\n  solid and tough, and what the crystal people have to do with making\r\n  it so.\r\n\r\n  The Britannica (28: 188) tells how, in the walls of volcanoes\r\n  Vulcan wrote out the hint for making re-enforced concrete which is\r\n  so important a feature of modern architectural engineering.\r\n\r\n  Look about on the rock-beds in the stone quarry and see if you\r\n  can't find some of the writing of that Older Cæsar with his queer\r\n  stone stylus. Probably the men in the quarry will have wondered how\r\n  these scratches came there and you can tell them.\r\n\r\n  There is one style of Mr. Glacier's hand-work that even the dogs\r\n  and the horses notice, and that is the \"mirror rocks.\" Muir tells\r\n  about them in his \"Mountains of California.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                              (DECEMBER)\r\n\r\n    \"A fire-mist and a planet,\r\n       A crystal and a cell,\r\n     A jelly fish and a saurian\r\n       And caves where the cavemen dwell;\r\n     Then a sense of law and beauty\r\n       And a face turned from the clod--\r\n     Some call it Evolution,\r\n       And others call it God.\"\r\n\r\n                                           --_William Herbert Carruth._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\nSo the Ice Ages and their glaciers and the Romans and their Cæsars\r\nmelted away. We know them only by the marks they left on the walls\r\nof time. But why this constant doing and undoing of things? We have\r\nseen it going on from the very beginning; rock crumbling to dust, dust\r\nchanging back to rock; rocks raised up into mountains, mountains worn\r\ndown to plains; then more mountains, and on through the same cycle of\r\nendless change; as if always starting the whole thing over again.\r\n\r\nWhat is it all about? Are we getting anywhere? If so, where?\r\n\r\nEver since men looked out upon the world around them and began to\r\nthink, they have puzzled not only about the causes but the purpose of\r\nthis endless drama of creation and decay. Some said one thing; some\r\nsaid another. The Persian poet who wrote those fine lines about the\r\nlion and the lizard in the ruins of the palaces meant to say that's\r\nall that everything comes to; all things, men included, return to the\r\nelements of which they were made and that's the end of them. So, said\r\nhe, what's the use of bothering one's head about it? There's nothing to\r\nbe learned. One verse of his famous song reads like this:\r\n\r\n    \"Myself when young did eagerly frequent\r\n     Doctor and saint, and heard great argument\r\n     About it and about; but evermore\r\n     Came out by the same door wherein I went.\"\r\n\r\nBut Science, as we shall now see, has a better answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Nothing Happens\r\n\r\nIn the first place you must have noticed as we came along through this\r\nlittle book that nothing happens in this world of ours; everything\r\nis under a government of laws. Not only did it turn out that there\r\nwas method in the apparent madness of the sea but we found method\r\neverywhere. It was not chance that made our worlds, whether they were\r\nborn full-grown or grew up piece by piece. And we see the same forces\r\nat work in small things as in the great. The force that keeps the earth\r\nin its orbit is just as careful to catch and plant the tiny seeds of\r\nthe grasses and the pine-trees drifting forward in the wind, so keeping\r\nthe world clothed with life and verdure.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL NATURE UNDER A GOVERNMENT OF LAW\r\n\r\nSo with the seasons with all that they mean in the life of the world;\r\nspring never fails to follow winter. Little things happen that make\r\nspring \"late,\" as we say; but spring itself never fails to come and\r\nalways in its right place in the procession of the year. All this\r\nbecause the earth stays in its orbit and spins on its axis. Watches\r\nbreak their mainsprings, clocks run down. These things \"happen\"; but\r\nwe never think of saying that the mainspring or the wheels \"happened,\"\r\nor that they \"happened\" into their places in the watch. The worlds not\r\nonly make their appointed round as regularly as the wheels of a watch\r\nbut they never run down, and the power that keeps them going and in\r\ntheir places never breaks. If it ever occurred in any other way--if we\r\nshould hear of a world flying out of its orbit and going banging around\r\namong the other worlds, we could talk of \"happening.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE'S ACCIDENT INSURANCE SYSTEM\r\n\r\nWe might call these laws that make it so certain that nature's business\r\nwill go on as usual, rain or shine, the Accident Insurance of the\r\nUniverse. We have nothing quite like it in human insurance systems; for\r\nthese only make it up to you--the best they can--after some accident\r\nhas happened. Nature's insurance system, on the other hand, makes it\r\ncertain that nothing _will_ happen to change the main course of things.\r\nThe protective insurance of the universe is woven right through Nature\r\nitself. The continents, for example, were bound, in due course, to rise\r\nin their places, because it is the nature of cooling masses to shrink\r\nand for the outside to cool the faster and to harden and to wrinkle up.\r\nIt doesn't matter whether the cooling mass is a little baked apple or a\r\nbig hot earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLOCK OF THE AGES\r\n\r\n  By representing the great geologic periods of time in the form of\r\n  a clock-face a writer in the _Scientific American_ enables us to\r\n  form a rough conception of their duration, their distinguishing\r\n  features, and their relations to one another, according to\r\n  ideas associated with the theory of La Place, but which have\r\n  been considerably modified in the light of later reasoning and\r\n  investigation. The view now generally accepted, for example, is\r\n  that the Azoic era was longer than all subsequent time. But, taking\r\n  the picture as it stands, each \"hour\" represents 3,000,000 years.\r\n  For a quarter of the total period up to the very recent appearance\r\n  of man \"there was darkness upon the face of the deep.\" Next after\r\n  the Azoic was the Laurentian Period, when \"the dry land appeared.\"\r\n  Later came the dawn of life, and this life, like the inanimate\r\n  matter which preceded it, kept rising and continues to rise, as the\r\n  ages pass, to higher, more beautiful, and nobler forms.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNor was it an accident that the continents in their original form grew\r\nlarger with the fat of the land that was added to them under the action\r\nof the chemistry of the air. You see Nature must understand chemistry\r\nor things wouldn't come out right in the laboratory, as they always do\r\nif you have made no mistakes. Ever think of that, Mr. High School Boy?\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Strangest Thing of All That Didn't Happen\r\n\r\nBut the strangest thing of all that didn't happen in this history of\r\nthe world and its making I'm going to tell you about now.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINSHIP OF KITTENS AND APPLE-TREES\r\n\r\nYou remember what I said of the apple-tree in Chapter V (page 93), how\r\nnobody who didn't know it to be true would believe that little Miss\r\nGreenleaf and old Mr. Root and rough Mr. Bark and lovely Miss Blossom\r\nwere not only born under the same roof but were as closely related as\r\na pussy-cat and her nest full of kittens. I didn't mention the kittens\r\nthen, but just suppose I had done so; and then had gone on to say\r\nthat kittens are relations of the apple family and that all birds are\r\nrelated to all kittens, and that both are kindred of that terrible Mr.\r\nCetiosaurus that we met in the Bad Lands of Dakota.\r\n\r\nWould you have believed it?\r\n\r\nNo? Well, I don't wonder. It was quite a while before the wise men of\r\nscience believed it. Now not only is this idea of the origin of all\r\nliving things--animal and vegetable--universally accepted by men of\r\nscience, but every educated person is supposed to know about it. It is\r\nalways, and as a matter of course, put into the school-books dealing\r\nwith the history of nature; just as in all histories we are sure to see\r\nColumbus landing in 1492 and George Washington being inaugurated April\r\n30, 1789.\r\n\r\nMost people, including the scientists, used to think that each kind of\r\nplant and animal was given its present form in the first place and that\r\nthis form had never changed. This was known as the \"special creation\"\r\ntheory; while the idea that the various kinds of plants and animals\r\nwe now know gradually developed from quite different forms is called\r\nthe theory of \"evolution.\" Among the curious facts that finally led\r\neducated people everywhere to believe this strangest of all the strange\r\nfairy tales of the land of science were these:\r\n\r\n\r\nAS WE READ THE ROCKS FROM THE BOTTOM UP\r\n\r\nThe remains and imprints of plant and animal life of long ago which we\r\nfind in the rocks show successions of related but different forms in\r\nthe rocks of different ages. At the beginning in the lowest rocks the\r\nforms are much alike, but grow more and more unlike as we climb these\r\nstairs of time. At first there are no animals with backbones; then\r\nthere come animals with backbones that resemble each other in general\r\nbuild; and finally such wide varieties of backboned creatures as fish,\r\nbirds, horses, and men. And so with endless varieties of birds and\r\nbeasts and creeping things and the trees and the grasses of the field.\r\n\r\nSometimes the differences between these apparently related forms, as\r\nwe find them in the rocks, are very great; but everything goes to show\r\nthat this is because there are missing pages, so to speak, in the great\r\nstone book. When you remember how long it takes to make one of these\r\nlayers of stone, and what they go through in cracking and twisting and\r\nwearing down on their way back to dust and the sea, and how quickly\r\nthe remains of big animals--to say nothing of plants and insects--are\r\ndestroyed, you must agree that the wonder is that we have any records\r\nat all. Yet so enormous has been the number of plants and animals that\r\nhave died in the course of the world's history that there have been\r\nfound hundreds and thousands of these remains and imprints between the\r\nlayers of stone. In all cases the fashions in form change from age to\r\nage; and the longer the time, as shown by the thickness of the rock,\r\nthe greater the change.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RABBIT THAT TURNED INTO A HORSE\r\n\r\nThe horse, which has been such a faithful carrier for man since man and\r\nhorse arrived from the lower ranges of life, also brought with him on\r\nthe way up one of the most complete of these strange autobiographies\r\nthat our brother animals have recorded with their bones. The most of\r\nthis story of the horse was found in the rocks of our Western States,\r\nbut the first chapter of it saw the light about forty years ago in\r\nEngland. When the bones were found in the rock deposits of that\r\ncountry known as London Clay they looked so unhorselike that a famous\r\npaleontologist (as the students of these ancient anatomies are called)\r\ngave it a name which means \"rabbit-like beast.\" But in rock of the\r\nsame age in Wyoming they afterward found the bones of an animal that\r\nlooked a little more like a horse, but plainly a close relation of\r\nthe rabbit-like beast. They went on finding different forms, through\r\nthirteen successive stages of rock history, and with each new period\r\nthe form kept getting larger and more horselike until they came to a\r\nhorse with three toes; and finally to one with the single big toe which\r\nwe call a hoof. Instead of the other two toes there were those two\r\nlittle lumps that you can feel in any horse's foot just above the hoof.\r\nThese are the ends of two small splintlike bones that are all there is\r\nleft of the other two toes.\r\n\r\nSo there have been found in the rock records more or less complete\r\nserial stories of thousands of plants and animals. In the case of man,\r\nnot only do we find that there were once human beings on earth like\r\nthe caveman with low forehead and huge jaw, but nothing has ever been\r\nfound to indicate that there were any higher types of human beings in\r\nexistence in his day. And both the caveman and the handsomest human\r\nbeings of to-day--the captain of our football team, for example--have\r\nessentially the same bodily framework as the monkey tribe. This does\r\nnot mean that man--even so low a creature as the caveman--descended\r\nfrom monkeys, any more than the fact that he has a backbone means he\r\ndescended from humming-birds. But the backbones in humming-birds,\r\nmonkeys, and men show that all are descended from older types of\r\nbackboned creatures. As monkeys and men are much more alike than men\r\nand birds they are evidently more closely related.\r\n\r\nWe might suppose, to be sure, that men and all other forms of life\r\nwhich they resemble in any way were so made from the beginning; that\r\nis, if we hadn't learned from the records of the rocks that they\r\n_weren't_ so made from the beginning. Yet, even after that, we might go\r\non supposing that each species was created separately, but that the\r\nform was changed from age to age. But in that case what are you going\r\nto say to this:\r\n\r\nIn man's body are several organs that are useless and often harmful.\r\nOther animals, also, contain among useful organs some that are\r\n\"out-of-date,\" as we would say if we were speaking of some old machines\r\nin a machine-shop. Why, in making a brand-new species, shouldn't Nature\r\nhave all the latest improvements from the start, just as man does in\r\nbuilding a brand-new home? If each species was separately created it is\r\nhard to understand why these useless or harmful organs should be kept;\r\nbut if one species grew out of another, by gradual improvement, just as\r\ncities grow out of villages, this is exactly what we might expect.\r\n\r\nOne of these useless organs in man is called the \"vermiform appendix.\"\r\nIt is always getting its name in the papers by giving trouble to some\r\nprominent man. Now this appendix, while a perfect nuisance to human\r\nbeings, is just the thing for cows and other grass-eating animals. In\r\nthem it is very large and of great use in digestion, while in the case\r\nof man and the monkey family it has shrunk into a little affair that\r\nputs in all its time either doing nothing or getting out of fix.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Upward; Always Upward\r\n\r\nThese are some of the reasons why the various varieties of animals are\r\nsupposed to have descended from common ancestors and to have undergone\r\nendless changes of form; changes as strange as anything that was ever\r\nwritten into a fairy story or acted out in a Christmas pantomime. There\r\nare other things quite as convincing and even more thrilling to read\r\nabout, such as the little theatre in the chicken's egg where strange,\r\nchanging shadows re-enact the drama of ancient life; but these I am\r\nhere passing by because my pages are running out and I want the rest\r\nof them to speak of what seems to me to be the greatest lesson of this\r\nwhole book; the greatest and most useful and happiest lesson Science\r\nor any kind of book can teach; namely, that not only is the universe\r\ngoverned by Laws and Mind, but that all these laws act together as one\r\nGreat Law and are working out one general result, the constant advance\r\nof all things toward a higher life.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MAN HAS RISEN AS HE DESCENDED\r\n\r\nAs there was a period in human history when there were no human beings\r\non earth higher than the cave-dweller, so there was a time when the\r\nhighest forms of animal and vegetable life were minute creatures and\r\nplants consisting only of a single cell. It is such low forms of\r\nvegetable life that make the scum on the still waters of a pond. Step\r\nby step, in both the animal and vegetable world, rose the higher forms.\r\nThe descent of man from lower forms of life used to be considered\r\nby many people as a thought that degraded humanity, but it is the\r\nmost promising fact in all nature. The striking thing is, not that\r\nwe are related in some way to the apes and the cavemen but that such\r\na creature as an ape or a caveman should have helped develop such a\r\nbeautiful thing as a little child.\r\n\r\nThis progress has not been steadily upward. The world of life, like\r\nthe surface of the globe itself, has had its ups and downs. Wonderful\r\nnations like Greece and Rome have risen and flourished and passed\r\naway, but they left the best of themselves, the part that time cannot\r\ndestroy. The Greeks taught us literature and art and the grace of life.\r\nThe Romans gave us a science of government and a solid way of doing\r\npractical things, such as the building of good roads and bridges. The\r\ngreat lesson of history is that civilization and human liberty and all\r\nthe things that make life worth living have not only survived the fall\r\nof empires but stand to-day on higher and firmer ground than they ever\r\ndid before.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD THAT MOTHER MADE\r\n\r\nBut do you know who was at the bottom of it all? Mother! All the things\r\nthat men have done in the development of national life, with its arts\r\nand industries, everything we call civilization, grew out of the life\r\nand industry of the home, and it was mother who finally made the home.\r\nThe mother idea came into the world with the first seed that ever\r\nstarted out to make its own way; for the mother plant had provided it\r\nwith food enough to keep it going until it could get well-established\r\nin business. But the kind of mothers we know, mothers who stay with\r\ntheir babies and feed them, came very late in the long story of life.\r\nIn the early days the world was not only without flowers and birds\r\nand the beautiful trees and varied landscapes we know, but it was\r\nmotherless, in the sense that we understand mothers. In the lowest\r\nforms of life, such as the insects, the mothers and children never\r\nsaw each other at all; for among the insects just as it is to-day the\r\nmother simply laid the eggs and then, before the little insects were\r\nborn, passed away. Even among the fish, who are much closer relations\r\nof ours than the insects--since fish belong to the great brotherhood\r\nof the backbone--the sense of motherhood doesn't get beyond looking\r\nafter the eggs. So with the next higher group to which the frogs\r\nbelong; and the next, the reptiles. Only with the birds, the next group\r\nabove the reptiles, do we begin to see what motherhood means. Then at\r\nthe very top of the list come the class of animals whose very name has\r\n\"mamma\" in it; the \"mammalia.\" Among these, even outside the human\r\nrace, we find very striking examples of family love and devotion. The\r\ngorillas, for instance, although they haven't what one would call an\r\nattractive face, are good to their folks. Not only does Mamma Gorilla\r\nnurse her babies and carry them in her arms much as a human mother\r\ndoes, and fight and die for them, but a famous African traveller tells\r\nof a Mamma Gorilla who stayed safe with the babies in their humble home\r\nof sticks in the fork of a tree while Papa Gorilla sat all night at the\r\nfoot of it, with his back against the trunk, to protect them from a\r\nleopard that had been seen prowling around.\r\n\r\nAmong most animals below man the babies are soon able to leave mother\r\nand shift for themselves, but in the case of human beings the baby is\r\nhelpless for a much longer time. So, even among the lowest savages, it\r\nwas necessary for father and mother to keep together and look after\r\ntheir children. Thus grew up family life; and out of the family the\r\ntribe; and out of many tribes living together and closely related, grew\r\nfirst small and then larger nations. Yet, always at the beginning, it\r\nwas the mother, more than the father, who looked after the children and\r\ntaught them, so bringing before the world the idea of doing things, not\r\nfor one's self alone but for others. From this came the mutual giving\r\nand helping which made national life possible, and that is making this\r\na better and better world to live in.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Great Unseen\r\n\r\nSo it is very plain not only that the end, the purpose of all this\r\nmachinery and march of things that we have been going through since the\r\nbeginning of Chapter I, is to make life better, more beautiful both\r\nin form and character, but to show that \"all nature is on the side of\r\nthose who try to rise.\"[59] It is plain also that this end must have\r\nbeen foreseen and intended from the beginning; for, from the very start\r\neach change in the world and in life was a preparation for another\r\nand a greater change. The change from rock to soil made plant life\r\npossible; the growth of plants made animal life possible, and so on up\r\nthrough the long succession of changes in this tree of life by which\r\nall things are related and which gave us the infinite variety of good\r\nthings we already have--fruit, homes, churches, schools, art galleries,\r\nbooks, railroads and steamships that make the whole world neighbors;\r\nthe telegraph, the newspapers, and the magazines that carry thought and\r\nknowledge and plans for the common good so fast and far that already\r\nit is as if a whole nation with its millions had a heart and brain in\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Drummond: \"The Ascent of Man.\"]\r\n\r\nMan himself, you see, has become one of the great forces of nature in\r\nthe evolution of nature, in the blossoming out and fruit-bearing of\r\nthings. But now notice this: Back of all that man does and all that the\r\nrest of nature does is the great controlling force called Mind; and\r\nthis Mind is invisible. If I should say of some great man that he had a\r\npowerful mind you would know just what I meant; but if anybody should\r\nask \"What did his mind _look_ like?\" you would think that was an odd\r\nquestion, wouldn't you?\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From the painting by Burne-Jones_\r\n\r\n                       THE FIRST DAY OF CREATION\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS PRINCESS HIDDEN IN THE BUD\r\n\r\nSo it is and has been from the beginning. We can see the _results_ of\r\nchanges of one thing into another but never just how the changing is\r\ndone. While it is no longer believed that species were given a certain\r\nform in the beginning and that they have always kept that form, it\r\nis still true that each species comes into being from some unseen\r\ncause--\"all of a sudden,\" as it were. Because species thus seem to vary\r\nof themselves, and not for any reason that we can see these changes are\r\ncalled \"spontaneous variations.\" Always back of the material nature we\r\ncan see is a nature that is not material; a part of nature that, like\r\nthe mind of man, we can neither see nor hear nor feel nor know by any\r\nof our five senses. Some Unseen Power forms the baby plant out of the\r\nseed; some power changes the leaves hidden away in the bud into the\r\npetals of the flower. When the leaves gather to form the bud, like\r\nlittle hands playing \"button, button, who's got the button,\" where do\r\nyou suppose the flower is? It _isn't_. It has not yet begun to be. But\r\nsoon, as if some magician had waved his wand and said \"Presto! Change!\"\r\nthe pink petals begin to form there in the dark of the cup and, first\r\nthing we know, out steps Miss Blossom, all in her pink and gold like a\r\nprincess dressed for a ball!\r\n\r\nBut always hidden in a mystery these changes take place. We can peep\r\ninto the growing bud as often as we like and we will never catch the\r\nfairies making the dress, nor the princess putting it on. We always see\r\nthe thing after it is done!\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDERFUL ART BUT WHERE IS THE ARTIST?\r\n\r\nAnother thing: How do the fairies of Roseland remember every spring\r\njust how a rose looked, when the roses of last year have been dead\r\nand gone so long? You see they work without a model, something great\r\nartists seldom do; and in some kinds of work, as busts and portraits\r\nand landscapes, never do at all. Even the most powerful microscope\r\ndoesn't show any pattern in the seed for the seed to go by in growing\r\ninto the finished plant; or in an egg to tell it what kind of a bird it\r\nis expected to be. No, not the trace of a pattern. What then, guides\r\nthe growth of the seed; of an oak, say, so that it finally and always\r\ntakes the family form? Some Power, evidently, as intelligent as the\r\npower that moves the hand of the human artist when he paints that oak\r\ninto his landscape. How many of us have stopped to think that not only\r\nin the world of mind but in the material world itself, all forms of\r\n_power_ are as invisible as the fairies that work unseen in the rosebud\r\nand the little birds' egg and the big rock? All power--what we call\r\nsteam power, wind power, electric power and the rest--are not only\r\nunseen but unseeable, unfeelable, untastable. We know steam power only\r\nwhen heat gets into the water and makes steam; electric power only when\r\nit gets into a wire or a dynamo; or, passing by unseen ways through the\r\nair, moves the wireless telegraph receiver; gravity power only when it\r\nmoves something as the water of a waterfall; or when it is helping to\r\nhold things--the earth and the other worlds--in their appointed paths.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  You can easily see why evolution is the most talked about of\r\n  all phases of science--of the study of this wonderful world we\r\n  live in. One reason is it's such an astonishing thing in itself,\r\n  this relationship of all forms of life, trees, kittens, birds,\r\n  and everything; another reason is that in reading the books on\r\n  evolution you're taken into every field of knowledge and into the\r\n  most curious and striking aspect of things in those fields. Could\r\n  anything be stranger, for example, than a little theatre in a\r\n  chicken's egg, over which pass strange shadowy forms that seem to\r\n  retell, in a kind of moving picture show, the story of how one form\r\n  of life developed out of another?\r\n\r\n  Drummond's \"Ascent of Man\" tells about that and covers the whole\r\n  subject of evolution. It is one of the books which no one who has\r\n  heard of this wonderful story of life should fail to read. Doctor\r\n  Drummond's way of telling the story is very attractive. Readers\r\n  from the Eighth Grade up to the Eightieth will delight in it,\r\n  and they won't stop until they read it from cover to cover. I'll\r\n  guarantee that!\r\n\r\n  Then take such a book as \"The World of Life,\" by Wallace. \"Alice in\r\n  Wonderland\" is nothing to it. Here are some of the things you will\r\n  find in it:\r\n\r\n  How there got to be different kinds of rabbits and what islands\r\n  have to do with it.\r\n\r\n  (Islands are almost as prominent in the story of evolution as they\r\n  are in the story of adventure. There are Robinson Crusoes until you\r\n  can't rest!)\r\n\r\n  How the pig in the struggle of life won out as usual.\r\n\r\n  Why the peacock has such a fine tail and how he overdid it.\r\n\r\n  How the elephant saved his life by lengthening his nose.\r\n\r\n  How the birds traded their teeth for feathers.\r\n\r\n  How shelled creatures coiled and uncoiled their shells.\r\n\r\n  Why we miss the \"missing links.\" (As you go into this subject of\r\n  evolution you will hear a good deal about missing links.)\r\n\r\n  How they know butterfly wings are made first and the coloring and\r\n  patterns laid on afterward.\r\n\r\n  How much of a butterfly's beauty is probably known to the\r\n  butterflies themselves.\r\n\r\n  How Nature seems to make things just to be pretty.\r\n\r\n  And these are just a few of the things in _one_ of Doctor Wallace's\r\n  books.[60]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: In addition to all this curious and absolutely reliable\r\ninformation that ought to be interesting to every one is the fact that\r\nWallace shows in \"The World of Life\" how there must have been Mind and\r\nPurpose back of it all. Doctor Wallace was a great traveller as well\r\nas a great student of nature--one of the most famous in the history of\r\nscience. His works include: \"Travels on the Amazon and the Rio Negro,\"\r\n\"The Malay Archipelago,\" \"Natural Selection,\" \"Darwinism,\" \"Island Life\r\nand the Geographic Distribution of Animals.\"\r\n\r\nThere are so many books on this biggest of all nature\r\ntopics--Evolution--that they make quite a library in themselves. The\r\nmost famous of these books is Darwin's \"Origin of Species,\" and it\r\nis not at all hard to understand. Other books bearing directly or\r\nindirectly on evolution are \"Animals of the Past,\" by Lucas, \"Creatures\r\nof Other Days,\" by Hutchinson, Fiske's \"Destiny of Man,\" and \"Evolution\r\nand Religion.\" A book for older readers--one of the latest and most\r\ncomprehensive treatments of the subject--is Osborn's \"Origin and\r\nEvolution of Life.\"]\r\n\r\n  Then he was such a fine man personally. Why, what do you think\r\n  he did? Although he thought out the principle of evolution\r\n  independently of Darwin, and wrote an essay on it before Darwin\r\n  had ever given his views to the world, yet after Darwin's \"Origin\r\n  of Species\"[61] came out Wallace gave Darwin all the credit,\r\n  and in his own autobiography always referred to the theory of\r\n  evolution as the \"Darwinian Theory.\" Yet Wallace had a very good\r\n  reason for taking this generous attitude, as you will see from his\r\n  autobiography and other writings, and you are quite likely to find\r\n  the reason in articles on Darwin or Wallace or Evolution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Of \"The Origin of Species\" it has been said that no work\r\never produced so profound a change in the opinions of mankind.]\r\n\r\n  The relations of Darwin and Wallace furnish one of the finest\r\n  examples in history of the best thing in the world--human\r\n  friendship.\r\n\r\n  Of course, like so many other great men, Wallace was one of those\r\n  boys whose minds never grow old. Read in his autobiography how on\r\n  the day he first discovered a new species of butterfly it gave him\r\n  a violent headache, and he had to go to bed to get rid of it and\r\n  quiet his nerves--he was that worked up!\r\n\r\n  Darwin was much the same sort of a man. Everything in the world was\r\n  interesting to him. He wrote a whole book about \"Fish Worms,\" for\r\n  example. And although probably the most famous man in the history\r\n  of natural science he was as humble as could be, always looking for\r\n  the truth and ready to accept criticisms no matter how much they\r\n  might upset his own previous conclusions, provided these opposing\r\n  views were supported by evidence. Of course you will want to know\r\n  more about his life, and you will find more in the \"Life and\r\n  Letters of Charles Darwin,\" edited by his son.\r\n\r\n  How do you suppose this boy began being a great man--by collecting\r\n  beetles! Beetles and outdoor sport were his chief delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE INDEX\r\n\r\nSOME THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THIS INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nI shouldn't be surprised if you thought that an index was the dullest\r\npart of a book.\r\n\r\nBut it all depends! As a matter of fact, with your help, I am sure I\r\ncan make this index of ours one of the most interesting things in the\r\nwhole story; for, like the H. & S., it gives you a chance to \"come into\r\nthe game.\" The mind enjoys books and grows upon them much as the body\r\ngrows on food, but, as in the case of both food and books--and books\r\nare food--the good you get depends not only on the food but _how you\r\nseason it and eat it_. You can't expect _everything_ of the cook!\r\n\r\nEverybody knows, of course, how to use an index to look things up once\r\nin a while and it saves time if the index not only tells the page on\r\nwhich a given subject is referred to, but conveys some idea of what\r\nthat reference is about, as this index tries to do. If, for example,\r\nyou are studying the Alpine regions in school you may already have\r\ncovered the question of how flowing water carves mountain valleys, but\r\nyou may not have had anything about why the Alps don't run north and\r\nsouth, as so many of earth's great ranges do; and so what could be a\r\nmore interesting thing for you to take into those delightful class\r\ndiscussions?\r\n\r\nYour teacher knows, although you may not have realized it, that these\r\nclass talks and debates by the pupils themselves are _the big thing_\r\nin modern teaching. The best education, we know nowadays, isn't the\r\nmere cramming down of facts, as people used to think. _It's training in\r\nthinking, and in standing on one's own feet!_\r\n\r\nBut memory training is important too; and an index is the best\r\nthing in the world for that. Take some subject you're studying in\r\nschool--mountains, for example--they're always studying such big\r\nthings as mountains, the work of rivers, and so on; or if they aren't\r\nto-day they will be tomorrow. Look at the references _as questions to\r\nyourself_ and see how well you can answer them: \"How do mountains help\r\nmake water-gates for the rivers?\" and \"Why do they have earthquakes in\r\nregions where mountains haven't got done with their growing?\"\r\n\r\nThen you can have a lot of fun with these questions at home and with\r\nboy friends, after you have read the book together. For instance: Just\r\nhow _did_ the pebbles help dig the Grand Canyon? And that's a poser\r\nfor many grown people too--people who've travelled and met the Grand\r\nCanyon face to face! Try it on Father. Yes, and Teacher too. There are\r\nnone of her boys that a teacher is so proud of as the boys that have\r\ninitiative--_go-aheaditiveness_--and can _ask_ good questions as well\r\nas answer them.\r\n\r\nBut, best of all, you can find no end of things to write about for\r\nyour language work in school and for the little books of your own that\r\nI've already suggested in the H. & S. Take the subject of pebbles,\r\nfor example. Although this whole book has to do with the life and\r\nadventures of pebbles, I haven't put the facts together in just the\r\nway _you_ will if you follow out the references under the heading\r\n\"Pebbles\" in this index. If you don't happen to remember how pebbles\r\nact as bankers for the farmers, how they helped make the Great Lakes,\r\nbuilt the Grand Canyon, and so on, look these things up and then, as\r\nthey thus become digested in your mind, write about them in your own\r\nway--the way you'd talk if you were telling somebody about it. Do that\r\nand you'll _have_ something! one of those things that mothers show to\r\nthe neighbors, and that teachers show to visitors.\r\n\r\nOf course you'll have to have a name for your story and you'll think of\r\nplenty: \"What One of My Pebbles Told Me,\" \"The Pebbles in the World's\r\nWork,\" \"What a Wonderful Thing a Pebble Is!\" \"Why Common Pebbles are\r\nWorth More than Diamonds\"; for of course a diamond is a kind of pebble.\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING ACQUAINTED WITH YOURSELF\r\n\r\nIn all this you will not only find you'll have a good time, but,\r\nlet me tell you, you'll be getting the best part of your education;\r\nyou'll be getting acquainted with yourself, your undeveloped powers of\r\nmemory--reasoning--expression. You'll find before you get so very old\r\nthat one of the most important elements of success, of doing _your_\r\npart in the world's great work of making itself better all the time, is\r\nin _having something worth while to say and being able to say it_.\r\n\r\nThis was the making of the Greeks; and the Greeks, you know, were the\r\nmost wonderful people that ever were. It all started with old \"Know\r\nThyself\" Thales of Miletus.\r\n\r\nThat's what did it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Africa, children's hand-work, illustrating home life of the natives,\r\n
