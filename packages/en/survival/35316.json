The skill of the great master, who built bones\r\ntogether as a child builds with a box of bricks, taught me that the laws\r\nwhich determine the forms of animals were less understood at that time\r\nthan the laws which govern the relations of men in their country. The\r\nlaws of Nature promised a better return of new knowledge for reasonable\r\nstudy. A lecture on Flying Reptiles determined me to attempt to fathom\r\nthe mysteries which gave new types of life to the Earth and afterwards\r\ntook them away.\r\n\r\nThus I became the very humble servant of the Dragons of the Air. Knowing\r\nbut little about them I went to Cambridge, and for ten years worked with\r\nthe Professor of Geology, the late Rev. Adam Sedgwick, LL.D., F.R.S., in\r\ngathering their bones from the so-called Cambridge Coprolite bed, the\r\nCambridge Greensand. The bones came in thousands, battered and broken,\r\nbut instructive as better materials might not have been. My rooms\r\nbecame filled with remains of existing birds, lizards, and mammals,\r\nwhich threw light on the astonishing collection of old bones which I\r\nassisted in bringing together for the University.\r\n\r\nIn time I had something to say about Flying Animals which was new. The\r\nstory was told in the theatre of the Royal Institution, in a series of\r\nlectures. Some of them were repeated in several English towns. There was\r\nstill much to learn of foreign forms of flying animals; but at last,\r\nwith the aid of the Government grant administered by the Royal Society,\r\nand the chiefs of the great Continental museums, I saw all the specimens\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nSo I have again written out my lectures, with the aid of the latest\r\ndiscoveries, and the story of animal structure has lost nothing in\r\ninterest as a twice-told tale. It still presents in epitome the story of\r\nlife on the Earth. He who understands whence the Flying Reptiles came,\r\nhow they endured, and disappeared from the Earth, has solved some of the\r\ngreatest mysteries of life. I have only contributed something towards\r\nsolving the problems.\r\n\r\nIn telling my story, chiefly of facts in Nature, an attempt is made to\r\nshow how a naturalist does his work, in the hope that perhaps a few\r\nreaders will find happiness in following the workings of the laws of\r\nlife. Such an illumination has proved to many worth seeking, a solid\r\nreturn for labour, which is not to be marketed on the Exchange, but may\r\nbe taken freely without exhausting the treasury of Nature's truths. Such\r\noutlines of knowledge as here are offered to a larger public, may also,\r\nI believe, be acceptable to students of science and scientific men.\r\n\r\nThe drawings given in illustration of the text have been made for me by\r\nMiss E.

Its\r\ncoming into existence, its structure, and passing away from the living\r\nworld are among the great mysteries of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe animals are astonishing in their plan of construction. In aspect\r\nthey are unlike birds and beasts which, in this age, hover over land and\r\nsea. They gather into themselves in the body of a single individual,\r\nstructures which, at the present day, are among the most distinctive\r\ncharacters of certain mammals, birds, and reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe name \"flying reptile\" expresses this anomaly. Its invention is due\r\nto the genius of the great French naturalist Cuvier, who was the first\r\nto realise that this extinct animal, entombed in slabs of stone, is one\r\nof the wonders of the world.\r\n\r\nThe word \"reptile\" has impressed the imagination with unpleasant sound,\r\neven when the habits of the animals it indicates are unknown. It is\r\nfamiliarly associated with life which is reputed venomous, and is\r\ncreeping and cold. Its common type, the serpent, in many parts of the\r\nworld takes a yearly toll of victims from man and beast, and has become\r\nthe representative of silent, active strength, dreaded craft, and\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nScience uses the word \"reptile\" in a more exact way, to define the\r\nassemblage of cold-blooded animals which in familiar description are\r\nseparately named serpents, lizards, turtles, hatteria, and crocodiles.\r\n\r\nTurtles and the rest of them survive from great geological antiquity.\r\nThey present from age to age diversity of aspect and habit, and in\r\nunexpected differences of outward proportion of the body show how the\r\nlaws of life have preserved each animal type. For the vital organs which\r\nconstitute each animal a reptile, and the distinctive bony structures\r\nwith which they are associated, remain unaffected, or but little\r\nmodified, by the animal's external change in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe creeping reptile is commonly imagined as the antithesis of the bird.\r\nFor the bird overcomes the forces that hold even man to the earth, and\r\nenjoys exalted aerial conditions of life. Therefore the marvel is shared\r\nequally by learned and unlearned, that the power of flight should have\r\nbeen an endowment of animals sprung from the breed of serpents, or\r\ncrocodiles, enabling them to move through the air as though they too\r\nwere of a heaven-born race. The wonder would not be lessened if the\r\nanimal were a degraded representative of a nobler type, or if it should\r\nbe demonstrated that even beasts have advanced in the battle of life.\r\nThe winged reptile, when compared with a bird, is not less astounding\r\nthan the poetic conceptions in Milton's _Paradise Lost_ of degradation\r\nwhich overtakes life that once was amongst the highest. And on the other\r\nhand, from the point of view of the teaching of Darwin in the theories\r\nof modern science, we are led to ask whether a flying reptile may not be\r\nevidence of the physical exaltation which raises animals in the scale of\r\norganisation. The dominance upon the earth of flying reptiles during the\r\ngreat middle period of geological history will long engage the interest\r\nof those who can realise the complexity of its structure, or care to\r\nunravel the meaning of the procession of animal forms in successive\r\ngeological ages which preceded the coming of man.\r\n\r\nThe outer vesture of an animal counts for little in estimating the value\r\nof ties which bind orders of animals together, which are included in the\r\nlarger classes of life. The kindred relationship which makes the snake\r\nof the same class as the tortoise is determined by the soft vital\r\norgans--brain, heart, lungs--which are the essentials of an animal's\r\nexistence and control its way of life. The wonder which science weaves\r\ninto the meaning of the word \"reptile,\" \"bird,\" or \"mammal,\" is partly\r\nin exhibiting minor changes of character in those organs and other soft\r\nparts, but far more in showing that while they endure unchanged, the\r\nhard parts of the skeleton are modified in many ways. For the bones of\r\nthe reptile orders stretch their affinities in one direction towards the\r\nskeletons of salamanders and fishes; and extend them also at the same\r\ntime in other directions, towards birds and mammals. This mystery we may\r\nhope to partly unravel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHOW A REPTILE IS KNOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF REPTILES BY THEIR VITAL ORGANS\r\n\r\nThe relations of reptiles to other animals may be stated so as to make\r\nevident the characters and affinities which bind them together. Early in\r\nthe nineteenth century naturalists included with the Reptilia the tribe\r\nof salamanders and frogs which are named Amphibia. The two groups have\r\nbeen separated from each other because the young of Amphibia pass\r\nthrough a tadpole stage of development. They then breathe by gills, like\r\nfishes, taking oxygen from the air which is suspended in water, before\r\nlungs are acquired which afterwards enable the animals to take oxygen\r\ndirectly from the air. The amphibian sometimes sheds the gills, and\r\nleaves the water to live on land. Sometimes gills and lungs are retained\r\nthrough life in the same individual. This amphibian condition of lung\r\nand gill being present at the same time is paralleled by a few fishes\r\nwhich still exist, like the Australian _Ceratodus_, the lung-fish, an\r\nancient type of fish which belongs to early days in geological time.\r\n\r\nThis metamorphosis has been held to separate the amphibian type from\r\nthe reptile because no existing reptile develops gills or undergoes a\r\nmetamorphosis. Yet the character may not be more important as a ground\r\nfor classification than the community of gills and lungs in the fish and\r\namphibian is ground for putting them together in one natural group. For\r\nalthough no gills are found in reptiles, birds, or mammals, the embryo\r\nof each in an early stage of development appears to possess gill-arches,\r\nand gill-clefts between them, through which gills might have been\r\ndeveloped, even in the higher vertebrates, if the conditions of life had\r\nbeen favourable to such modification of structure. In their bones\r\nReptiles and Amphibia have much in common. Nearly all true reptiles lay\r\neggs, which are defined like those of birds by comparatively large size,\r\nand are contained in shells. This condition is not usual in amphibians\r\nor fishes. When hatched the young reptile is completely formed, the\r\nimage of its parent, and has no need to grow a covering to its skin like\r\nsome birds, or shed its tail like some tadpoles. The reptile is like the\r\nbird in freedom from important changes of form after the egg is hatched;\r\nand the only structure shed by both is the little horn upon the nose,\r\nwith which the embryo breaks the shell and emerges a reptile or a bird,\r\ngrowing to maturity with small subsequent variations in the proportions\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1  LUNG OF THE FISH CERATODUS\r\n\r\n  Partly laid open to show its chambered structure (After Guenther)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPTILE SKIN\r\n\r\nBetween one class of animals and another the differences in the\r\ncondition of the skin are more or less distinctive. In a few amphibians\r\nthere are some bones in the skin on the under side of the body, though\r\nthe skin is usually naked, and in frogs is said to transmit air to the\r\nblood, so as to exercise a respiratory function of a minor kind. This\r\nnaked condition, so unlike the armoured skin of the true Reptilia,\r\nappears to have been paralleled by a number of extinct groups of fossils\r\nof the Secondary rocks, such as Ichthyosaurs and Plesiosaurs, which were\r\naquatic, and probably also by some Dinosauria, which were terrestrial.\r\n\r\nLiving reptiles are usually defended with some kind of protection to the\r\nskin. Among snakes and lizards the skin has commonly a covering of\r\noverlapping scales, usually of horny or bony texture. The tortoise and\r\nturtle tribe shut up the animal in a true box of bone, which is cased\r\nwith an armour of horny plates. Crocodiles have a thick skin embedding a\r\nless continuous coat of mail. Thus the skin of a reptile does not at\r\nfirst suggest anything which might become an organ of flight; and its\r\ndermal appendages, or scales, may seem further removed from the feathers\r\nwhich ensure flying powers to the bird than from the naked skin of a\r\nfrog.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPTILE BRAIN\r\n\r\nAlthough the mode of development of the young and the covering of the\r\nskin are conspicuous among important characters by which animals are\r\nclassified, the brain is an organ of some importance, although of\r\ngreater weight in the higher Vertebrata than in its lower groups.\r\nReptiles have links in the mode of arrangement of the parts of their\r\nbrains with fishes and amphibians. The regions of that organ are\r\ncommonly arranged in pairs of nervous masses, known as (1) the olfactory\r\nlobes, (2) the cerebrum, behind which is the minute pineal body,\r\nfollowed by (3) the pair of optic lobes, and hindermost of all (4) the\r\nsingle mass termed the cerebellum. These parts of the brain are extended\r\nin longitudinal order, one behind the other in all three groups. The\r\nolfactory lobes of the brain in Fishes may be as large as the cerebrum;\r\nbut among Reptiles and Amphibians they are relatively smaller, and they\r\nassume more of the condition found in mammals like the Hare or Mole,\r\nbeing altogether subordinate in size. And the cerebral masses begin to\r\nbe wider and higher than the other parts of the brain, though they do\r\nnot extend forward above the olfactory lobes, as is often seen in\r\nMammals. In Crocodiles the cerebral hemispheres have a tendency to a\r\nbroad circular form. Among Chelonian reptiles that region of the brain\r\nis more remarkable for height. Lizards and Ophidians both have this part\r\nof the brain somewhat pear-shaped, pointed in front, and elongated. The\r\namphibian brain only differs from the lizard type in degree; and\r\ndifferences between lizards' and amphibian brains are less noticeable\r\nthan between the other orders of reptiles. The reptilian brain is easily\r\ndistinguished from that of all other animals by the position and\r\nproportions of its regions (see Fig. 19, p. 53).\r\n\r\nBirds have the parts of the brain formed and arranged in a way that is\r\nequally distinctive. The cerebral lobes are relatively large and convex,\r\nand deserve the descriptive name \"hemispheres.\" They are always smooth,\r\nas among the lower Mammals, and extend backward so as to abut against\r\nthe hind brain, termed the cerebellum. This junction is brought about in\r\na peculiar way. The cerebral hemispheres in a bird do not extend\r\nbackward to override the optic lobes, and hide them, as occurs among\r\nadult mammals, but they extend back between the optic lobes, so as to\r\nforce them apart and push them aside, downward and backward, till they\r\nextend laterally beyond the junction of the cerebrum with the\r\ncerebellum. The brain of a Bird is never reptilian; but in the young\r\nMammal the brain has a very reptilian aspect, because both have their\r\nparts primarily arranged in a line. Therefore the brain appears to\r\ndetermine the boundary between bird and reptile exactly.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPTILIAN BREATHING ORGANS\r\n\r\nThe breathing organs of Birds and Reptiles which are associated with\r\nthese different types of brain are not quite the same. The Frog has a\r\ncellular lung which, in the details of the minute sacs which branch and\r\ncluster at the terminations of the tubes, is not unlike the condition in\r\na Mammal. In a mammal respiration is aided by the bellows-like action of\r\nthe muscles connected with the ribs, which encase the cavity where the\r\nlungs are placed, and this structure is absent in the Frog and its\r\nallies. The Frog, on the other hand, has to swallow air in much the same\r\nway as man swallows water. The air is similarly grasped by the muscles,\r\nand conveyed by them downward to the lungs. Therefore a Frog keeps its\r\nmouth shut, and the animal dies from want of air if its mouth is open\r\nfor a few minutes.\r\n\r\nCrocodiles commonly lie in the sun with their mouths widely open. The\r\nlungs in both Crocodiles and Turtles are moderately dense, traversed by\r\ngreat bronchial tubes, but do not differ essentially in plan from those\r\nof a Frog, though the great branches of the bronchial tubes are\r\nstronger, and the air chambers into which the lung is divided are\r\nsomewhat smaller. The New Zealand Hatteria has the lungs of this\r\ncellular type, though rather resembling the amphibian than the\r\nCrocodile. The lungs during life in all these animals attain\r\nconsiderable size, the maximum dimensions being found in the terrestrial\r\ntortoises, which owe much of their elevated bulk to the dimensions of\r\nthe air cells which form the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe lungs of Serpents and Lizards are formed on a different plan. In\r\nboth those groups of reptiles the dense cellular tissue is limited to\r\nthe part of the lung which is nearest to the throat. This network of\r\nblood vessels and air cells extends about the principal bronchial tube\r\nmuch as in other animals, but as it extends backward the blood vessels\r\nbecome few until the _tubular_ lung appears in its hinder part, as it\r\nextends down the body, almost as simple in structure as the air bladder\r\nof a fish. Among Serpents only one of these tubular lungs is commonly\r\npresent, and the structure has a less efficient appearance as a\r\nbreathing organ than the single lung of the fish _Ceratodus_ (Fig. 1).\r\nThe Chameleons are a group of lizards which differ in many ways from\r\nmost of their nearest kindred, and the lungs, while conforming in\r\ngeneral plan to the lizard type in being dense at the throat, and a\r\ntubular bladder in the body, give off on both sides a number of short\r\nlateral branches like the fingers of a glove (Fig. 18, p. 51).\r\n\r\nThus the breathing organs of reptiles present two or three distinct\r\ntypes which have caused Serpents and Lizards to be associated in one\r\ngroup by most naturalists who have studied their anatomy; while\r\nCrocodiles and Chelonians represent a type of lung which is quite\r\ndifferent, and in those groups has much in common. These characters of\r\nthe breathing organs contribute to separate the cold-blooded armoured\r\nreptiles from the warm-blooded birds clothed with feathers, as well as\r\nfrom the warm-blooded mammals which suckle their young; for both these\r\nhigher groups have denser and more elastic spongy lung tissue.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen hereafter that many birds in the most active development\r\nof their breathing organs substantially revert to the condition of the\r\nSerpent or Chameleon in a somewhat modified way. Because, instead of\r\nhaving one great bronchial tube expanded to form a vast reservoir of air\r\nwhich can be discharged from the lung in which the reptile has\r\naccumulated it, the bird has the lateral branches of the bronchial tubes\r\nprolonged so as to pierce the walls of the lung, when its covering\r\nmembrane expands to form many air cells, which fill much of the cavity\r\nof the bird's body (see Fig. 16). Thus the bird appears to combine the\r\ncharacters of such a lung as that of a Crocodile, with a condition which\r\nhas some analogy with the lung of a Chameleon. It is this link of\r\nstructure of the breathing organs between reptiles and birds that\r\nconstitutes one of the chief interests of flying reptiles, for they\r\nprove to have possessed air cells prolonged from the lungs, which\r\nextended into the bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA REPTILE IS KNOWN BY ITS BONES\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are a few illustrations of ways in which reptiles resemble other\r\nanimals, and differ from them, in the organs by means of which the\r\nclassification of animals is made. But such an idea is incomplete\r\nwithout noticing that the bony framework of the body associated with\r\nsuch vital organs also shows in its chief parts that reptiles are easily\r\nrecognised by their bones. I will therefore briefly state how reptiles\r\nare defined in some regions of the skeleton, for in tracing the history\r\nof reptile life the bones are the principal remains of animals preserved\r\nin the rocks; and the soft organs which have perished can only be\r\ninferred to have been present from the persistence of durable\r\ncharacteristic parts of the skeleton, which are associated with those\r\nsoft organs in animals which exist at the present day, and are unknown\r\nin other animals in which the skeleton is different.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HANG OF THE LOWER JAW\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the lower jaw is connected with the skull yields one\r\nof the most easily recognised differences between the great groups of\r\nvertebrate animals.\r\n\r\n_In Mammals._--In every mammal--such as the Dog or Sheep--the lower jaw,\r\nwhich is formed of one bone on each side, joins directly on to the head\r\nof the animal, and moves upon a bone of the skull which is named the\r\ntemporal bone. This character is sufficient to prove, by the law of\r\nassociation of soft and hard parts of the body, that such an animal had\r\nwarm blood and suckled its young.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2   _PTERODACTYLUS KOCHI_   SKULL OF BEAR\r\n\r\n  Comparison to show the articulation with the lower jaw in a mammal\r\n  and _Pterodactylus Kochi_. The quadrate bone is lettered Q in this\r\n  Pterodactyle, and comes between the skull and the lower jaw like the\r\n  quadrate bone in a bird and in lizards.]\r\n\r\n_In Birds._--In birds a great difference is found in this region of the\r\nhead. The temporal bone, which it will be more convenient to name the\r\nsquamosal bone, from its squamous or scale-like form, is still a part of\r\nthe brain case, and assists in covering the brain itself, exactly as\r\namong mammals. But the lower jaw is now made up of five or six bones.\r\nAnd between the hindermost and the squamosal there is an intervening bar\r\nof bone, unknown among mammalia, which moves upon the skull by a joint,\r\njust as the lower jaw moves upon it. This movable bone unites with parts\r\nof the palate and the face, and is known as the quadrate bone. Its\r\npresence proves that the animal possessing it laid eggs, and if the\r\nface bones join its outer border just above the lower jaw, it proves\r\nthat the animal possessed hot blood.\r\n\r\n_In Reptiles._--All reptiles are also regarded as possessing the\r\nquadrate bone. But the squamosal bone with which it always unites is in\r\nless close union with the brain case, and never covers the brain itself.\r\nSerpents show an extreme divergence in this condition from birds, for\r\nthe squamosal bone appears to be a loose external plate of bone which\r\nrests upon the compact brain case and gives attachment to the quadrate\r\nbone which is as free as in a bird. Among Lizards the quadrate bone is\r\nusually almost as free. In the other division of existing Reptilia,\r\nincluding Crocodiles, the New Zealand lizard-like reptile Hatteria,\r\ncalled Tuatera, and Turtles, the squamosal and quadrate bones are firmly\r\nunited with the bones of the brain case, face, and palate, so that the\r\nquadrate bone has no movement; and the same condition appears in\r\namphibians, such as Toads and Frogs. With these conditions of the\r\nquadrate bone are associated cold blood, terrestrial life, and young\r\ndeveloped from eggs.\r\n\r\n_In Fishes._--Bony fishes, and all others in which separate bones build\r\nup the skull, differ from Reptiles and Birds much as those animals\r\ndiffer from Mammals. The union of the lower jaw with the skull becomes\r\ncomplicated by the presence of additional bones. The quadrate bone still\r\nforms a pulley articulation upon which the lower jaw works, but between\r\nit and the squamosal bone is the characteristic bone of the fish known\r\nas the hyomandibular, commonly connected with opercular bones and\r\nmetapterygoid which intervene, and help to unite the quadrate with the\r\nbrain case. In the Cartilaginous fishes there is only one bone\r\nconnecting the jaws with the skull on each side. This appears to prove\r\nthat just as the structure of the arch of bones suspending the jaw may\r\nbe complicated by the mysterious process called segmentation, which\r\nseparates a bone into portions, so simplification and variation may\r\nresult because the primitive divisions of the material cease to be made\r\nwhich exists before bones are formed.\r\n\r\nThe principal regions of the skull and skeleton all vary in the chief\r\ngroups of animals with backbones; so that the Reptile may be recognised\r\namong fossils, even in extinct groups of animals and occasionally\r\nrestored from a fragment, to the aspect which characterised it while it\r\nlived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nANIMALS WHICH FLY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of a reptile is now sufficiently intelligible for something\r\nto be said concerning flight, and structures by means of which some\r\nanimals lift themselves in the air. It is not without interest to\r\nremember that, from the earliest periods in human records,\r\nrepresentations have been made of animals which were furnished with\r\nwings, yet walked upon four feet, and in their typical aspect have the\r\nhead shaped like that of a bird. They are commonly named Dragons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLYING DRAGONS\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3  From _The Battle between Bel and the Dragon_]\r\n\r\nThe effigy of the dragon survives to the present day in the figure over\r\nwhich St. George triumphs, on the reverse of the British sovereign. In\r\nthe luxuriant imaginations of ancient Eastern peoples, dating back to\r\nprehistoric ages, perhaps 5000 B.C., the dragons present an astonishing\r\nconstancy of form. In after-times they underwent a curious evolution, as\r\nthe conception of Babylon and Egypt is traced through Assyria to Greece.\r\nThe Wings, which had been associated at first with the fore limb of the\r\ntypical dragon, become characteristic of the Lion, and of the poet's\r\nwinged Horse, and finally of the Human figure itself, carved on the\r\ngreat columns of the Greek temples of Ephesus. These flying animals are\r\nhistorically descendants of the same common stock with the dragons of\r\nChina and Japan, which still preserve the aspect of reptiles. Their\r\ninterest is chiefly in evidence of a latent spirit of evolution in days\r\ntoo remote for its meaning to be now understood, which has carried the\r\nwinged forms higher and ever higher in grade of organisation, till their\r\nwings ceased to be associated with feelings of terror. The Hebrew\r\ncherubim are regarded by H. E. Ryle, Bishop of Exeter, as probably\r\nDragons, and the figure of the conventional angel is the human form of\r\nthe Dragon.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.  FIGURE FROM THE TEMPLE OF EPHESUS]\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANS OF FLIGHT\r\n\r\nTurning from this reference to the realm of mythology to existing\r\nnature, the power of flight is popularly associated with all the chief\r\ntypes of vertebrate animals--fishes, frogs, lizards, birds, and mammals.\r\nMany of the animals ill deserve the name of flyers, and most are\r\nexceptions to different conditions of existence which control their\r\nkindred, but it is convenient to examine for a little the nature of the\r\nstructures by which this movement in the air, which is not always\r\nflight, is made possible. Certain fishes, like the lung-fish Ceratodus,\r\nof Queensland, and the mud-fish Lepidosiren, are capable of leaving the\r\nwater and living on land, and for a time breathe air. But neither these\r\nfishes nor Periophthalmus, which runs with rapid movement of its fins\r\nand carries the body more or less out of water, or the climbing perch,\r\nAnabas, carried out of water over the country by Indian jugglers, ever\r\nput on the slightest approach to wings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLYING FISHES\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.  THE FLYING FISH EXOCOETUS\r\n\r\n  With the fins extended moving through the air]\r\n\r\nThe flight of fishes is a kind of parachute support not unlike that by\r\nwhich a folded paper is made to travel in the air. It is chiefly seen in\r\nthe numerous species of a genus Exocoetus, allied to the gar-pike\r\n(Belone), which is common in tropical seas, and usually from a foot to\r\neighteen inches long. They emerge from the water, and for a time support\r\nthemselves in the air by means of the greatly developed breast fins,\r\nwhich sometimes extend backward to the tail fin. Although these fins\r\nappear to correspond to the fore limbs of other animals, they may not be\r\nmoved at the will of the fish like the wing of a bird. When the flying\r\nfishes are seen in shoals in the vicinity of ships, those fins remain\r\nextended, so that the fish is said sometimes to travel 200 yards at a\r\nspeed of fifteen miles an hour, rising twenty feet or more above the\r\nsurface of the sea, travelling in a straight line, though sometimes\r\ninfluenced by the wind. Here the organ, which is at once a fin and a\r\nwing, consists of a number of thin long rods, or rays, which are\r\nconnected by membrane, and vary in length to form an outline not unlike\r\nthe wing of a bird which tapers to a point. The interest of these\r\nanimals is chiefly in the fact that flight is separated from the\r\ncondition of having lungs with which it is associated in birds, for\r\nalthough the flying fish has an air bladder, there is no duct to connect\r\nit with the throat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLYING FROGS\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.  THE FLYING FROG (RHACOPHORUS)\r\n\r\n  The membranes of the foot and hand extend between the metatarsal and\r\n  metacarpal bones, as well as the bones of the digits.]\r\n\r\nAmong amphibians the organs of flight are also of a parachute kind, but\r\nof a different nature. They are seen in certain frogs which frequent\r\ntrees, and are limited to membranes which extend between the diverging\r\ndigits of the hand and foot, forming webs as fully developed as in the\r\nfoot of a swimming bird. As these frogs leap, the membranes are expanded\r\nand help to support the weight of the body, so that the animal descends\r\nmore easily as it moves from branch to branch. There is no evidence that\r\nthe bones of the digits ever became elongated like the fin rays of the\r\nflying fish or the wing bones of a Bat; but the web suggests the basis\r\nof such a wing, and the possibilities under which wings may first\r\noriginate, by elongation of the bones of a webbed hand like that of a\r\nFlying Frog.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLYING LIZARDS\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.  THE FLYING DRAGON, DRACO\r\n\r\n  Forming a parachute by means of the extended ribs]\r\n\r\nThe Reptilia in their several orders are remarkable for absence of any\r\nmodification of the arms which might suggest a capacity for acquiring\r\nwings, as being latent in their organisation. Crocodiles, Tortoises, and\r\nSerpents are alike of the earth, and not of the air. But among Lizards\r\nthere are small groups of animals in which a limited capacity for\r\nmovement through the air is developed. It is best known in the family of\r\nsmall lizards named Dragons, represented typically by the species _Draco\r\nvolans_ found in the Oriental region of the East Indies and Malay\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nThe organ of flight is produced in an unexpected way, by means of the\r\nribs instead of the limbs. The ribs extend outward as far as the arms\r\ncan stretch, and the first five or six are prolonged beyond the body so\r\nas to spread a fold of skin on each side between the arm and the leg.\r\nThe membrane admits of some movement with the ribs. This arrangement\r\nforms a parachute, which enables the animal to move rapidly among\r\nbranches of trees, extending the structure at will, so that it is used\r\nwith rapidity too quick to be followed by the eye, as it leaps through\r\nconsiderable distances.\r\n\r\nA less singular aid to movement in the air is found in some of the\r\nlizards termed Geckos. The so-called Flying Gecko (_Platydactylus\r\nhomalocephalus_) has a fringe unconnected with ribs, which extends\r\nlaterally on the sides of the body and tail, as well as at the back and\r\nfront of the fore and hind limbs, and between the digits, where the web\r\nis sometimes almost as well developed as among Tree Frogs. This is\r\nessentially a lateral horizontal frill, extending round the body. Its\r\nchief interest is in the circumstance that it includes a membrane which\r\nextends between the wrist bones and the shoulder on the front of the\r\narm. That is the only part of the fringe which represents the wing\r\nmembrane of a bird. The fossil flying reptiles have not only that\r\nmembrane, but the lateral membranes at the sides of the body and behind\r\nthe arms.\r\n\r\nOther lizards have the skin developed in the direction of the\r\ncircumference of the body. In the Australian Chlamydosaurus it forms an\r\nimmense frill round the neck like a mediaeval collar. But though such an\r\nadornment might break a fall, it could not be regarded as an organ of\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLYING BIRDS\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.  POSITION OF BIRDS IN FLIGHT]\r\n\r\nThe wings of birds, when they are developed so as to minister to flight,\r\nare all made upon one plan; but as examples of the variation which the\r\norgans contributing to make the fore limb manifest, I may instance the\r\nshort swimming limb of the Penguin, the practically useless rudiment of\r\na wing found in the Ostrich or Kiwi, and the fully developed wing of the\r\nPigeon. The wings of birds obtain an extensive surface to support the\r\nanimal by muscular movements of three modifications of structure. First,\r\nthe bones of the fore limb are so shaped that they cannot, in existing\r\nbirds, be applied to the ground for support and be used like the limbs\r\nof quadrupeds, and are therefore folded up at the sides of the body,\r\nand carried in an unused or useless state so long as the animal hops on\r\nthe ground or walks, balancing its weight on the hind legs. Secondly,\r\nthere are two small folds of skin, less conspicuous than those on the\r\narms of Geckos; one is between the wrist bones and the shoulder, and the\r\nsmaller hinder membrane is between the upper arm and the body. These\r\nmembranous expansions are insignificant, and would in themselves be\r\ninadequate to support the body or materially assist its movements.\r\nThirdly, the bird develops appendages to the skin which are familiarly\r\nknown as feathers, and the large feathers which make the wing are\r\nattached to the skin covering the lower arm bone named the ulna, and the\r\nother bones which represent the wrist and hand. The area and form of the\r\nbird's wing are due to individual appendages to the skin, which are\r\nunknown in any other group of animals. Between the extended wing of the\r\nAlbatross, measuring eleven feet in spread, and the condition in the\r\nKiwi of New Zealand, in which the wing is vanishing, there is every\r\npossible variation in size and form. As a rule, the larger the animal\r\nthe smaller is the wing area. The problem of the origin of the bird's\r\nwing is not to be explained by study of existing animals; for the rowing\r\norgan of the Penguin, which in itself would never suggest flight,\r\nbecomes an organ of flight in other birds by the growth upon it of\r\nsuitable feathers. Anyone who has seen the birds named Divers feeding\r\nunder water, swimming rapidly with their wings, might never suspect that\r\nthey were also organs of aerial flight. The Ostrich is even more\r\ninteresting, for it has not developed flight, and still retains at the\r\nextremities of two of the digits the slender claws of a limb which was\r\noriginally no wing at all, but the support of a four-footed animal (Fig.\r\n46, p. 130).\r\n\r\n\r\nFLYING MAMMALS\r\n\r\nFlight is also developed among mammals. The Insectivora include several\r\ninteresting examples of animals which are capable of a certain motion\r\nthrough the air. In the tropical forests of the Malay Archipelago are\r\nanimals known as Flying Squirrels, Flying Opossums, Flying Lemurs,\r\nFlying Foxes, in which the skin extends outward laterally from the sides\r\nof the body so as to connect the fore limbs with the hind limbs, and is\r\nalso prolonged backward from the hind limbs to the tail. The four digits\r\nare never elongated; the bones of the fore limb are neither longer nor\r\nlarger than those of the hind limb, and the foot terminates in five\r\nlittle claws as in other four-footed animals. This condition is adapted\r\nfor the arboreal life which those animals live, leaping from branch to\r\nbranch, feeding on fruits and leaves, and in some cases upon insects.\r\nThese mammals may be compared with the Flying Geckos among reptiles in\r\ntheir parachute-like support by extension of the skin, which gives them\r\none of the conditions of support which contribute to constitute flight.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.  FLYING SQUIRREL (PTEROMYS)]\r\n\r\n_Bats._--One entire order of mammals--the Bats--not only possess true\r\nwings, but are capable of flight which is sustained, and in some cases\r\npowerful. The wings are clothed with short hair like the rest of the\r\nbody, and thus the instrument of flight is unlike that of a bird. The\r\nflight of a Bat differs from that of all other animals in being\r\ndependent upon a modification of the bones of the fore limb, which,\r\nwithout interfering with the animal's movements as a quadruped, secures\r\nan extension of the wing which is not inferior in area to that which the\r\nbird obtains by elongation of the bones of the arm and fore-arm and its\r\nfeathers. The distinctive peculiarity of the Bat's wing is in the\r\ncircumstance that four of the digits of the hand have their bones\r\nprolonged to a length which is often equal to the combined length of the\r\narm and fore-arm. The bones of the digits diverge like the ribs of an\r\numbrella, and between them is the wing membrane, which extends from the\r\nsides of the body outward, unites the fore limb with the hind limb, and\r\nis prolonged down the tail as in the Flying Foxes. Bats have a small\r\nmembrane in front of the bones of the arm and fore-arm stretching\r\nbetween the shoulder and the wrist, which corresponds with the wing\r\nmembrane of a bird; but the remainder of the membranes in Bats' wings\r\nare absent in birds, because their function is performed by feathers\r\nwhich give the wing its area. The elongated digits of the Bat's wing are\r\nfolded together and carried at the sides of the body as though they were\r\na few quill pens attached to its wrist, where the one digit, which is\r\napplied to the ground in walking, terminates in a claw.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10  NEW ZEALAND BAT FLYING. BARBASTELLE WALKING]\r\n\r\nThe organs which support animals in the air are thus seen to be more or\r\nless dissimilar in each of the great groups of animals. They fall into\r\nthree chief types: first, the parachute; secondly, the wing due to the\r\nfeathers appended to the skin; and thirdly, the wing formed of membrane,\r\nsupported by enormous elongation of the small bones of the back of the\r\nhand and fingers. The two types of true wings are limited to birds and\r\nbats; and no living reptile approximates to developing such an organ of\r\nflight as a wing. Judged, therefore, by the method of comparing the\r\nanatomical structures of one animal with another, which is termed\r\n\"comparative anatomy,\" the existence of flying reptiles might be\r\npronounced impossible. But in the light which the revelations of geology\r\nafford, our convictions become tempered with modesty; and we learn that\r\nwith Nature nothing is impossible in development of animal structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE PTERODACTYLE\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in the eighteenth century, in 1784, a small fossil animal with\r\nwings began to be known through the writings of Collini, as found in the\r\nwhite lithographic limestone of Solenhofen in Bavaria, and was regarded\r\nby him as a former inhabitant of the sea. The foremost naturalist of the\r\ntime, the citizen Cuvier--for it was in the days of the French\r\nRepublic--in 1801, in lucid language, interpreted the animal as a genus\r\nof Saurians. That word, so familiar at the present day, was used in the\r\nfirst half of the century to include Lizards and Crocodiles; and\r\ndescribed animals akin to reptiles which were manifestly related neither\r\nto Serpents nor Turtles. But the term saurian is no longer in favour,\r\nand has faded from science, and is interesting only in ancient history\r\nof progress. The lizards soon became classed in close alliance with\r\nsnakes. And the crocodiles, with the Hatteria, were united with\r\nchelonians. Most modern naturalists who use the term saurian still make\r\nit an equivalent of lizard, or an animal of the lizard kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUVIER\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.  _PTERODACTYLUS LONGIROSTRIS_ (Cuvier)\r\n\r\n  The remains are preserved with the neck arched over the back, and the\r\n  jaws opened upward]\r\n\r\nCuvier defined this fossil from Solenhofen as distinguished by the\r\nextreme elongation of the fourth digit of the hand, and from that\r\ncharacter invented for the animal the name Pterodactyle. He tells us\r\nthat its flight was not due to prolongation of the ribs, as among the\r\nliving lizards named Dragons; or to a wing formed without the digits\r\nbeing distinguishable from each other, as among Birds; nor with only one\r\ndigit free from the wing, as among Bats; but by having the wing\r\nsupported mainly by a single greatly elongated digit, while all the\r\nothers are short and terminate in claws. Cuvier described the amazing\r\nanimal in detail, part by part; and such has been the influence of his\r\nclear words and fame as a great anatomist that nearly every writer in\r\nafter-years, in French and in English, repeated Cuvier's conclusion,\r\nmaintained to the end, that the animal is a saurian.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.  THE SKELETON OF _PTERODACTYLUS LONGIROSTRIS_\r\n\r\n  Reconstructed from the scattered bones in Fig. 14, showing the limbs\r\n  on the left side]\r\n\r\nLong before fashion determined, as an article of educated belief, that\r\nfossil animals exist chiefly to bridge over the gaps between those which\r\nstill survive, the scientific men of Germany were inclined to see in the\r\nPterodactyle such an intermediate type of life. At first Soemmerring and\r\nWagler would have placed the Pterodactyle between mammals and birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDFUSS\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.  THE _PTERODACTYLUS LONGIROSTRIS_ RESTORED\r\n  FROM THE REMAINS IN FIG. 11\r\n\r\n  Showing positions of the wing membranes with the animal at rest]\r\n\r\nBut the accomplished naturalist Goldfuss, who described another fine\r\nskeleton of a Pterodactyle in 1831, saw in this flying animal an\r\nindication of the course taken by Nature in changing the reptilian\r\norganisation to that of birds and mammals. It is the first flash of\r\nlight on a dark problem, and its brilliance of inference has never been\r\nequalled. Its effects were seen when Prince Charles Bonaparte, the\r\neminent ornithologist, in Italy, suggested for the group the name\r\nOrnithosauria; when the profound anatomist de Blainville, in France,\r\nplaced the short-tailed animal in a class between Reptiles and Birds\r\nnamed Pterodactylia; and Andreas Wagner, of Munich, who had more\r\nPterodactyles to judge from than his predecessors, saw in the fossil\r\nanimal a saurian in transition to a bird.\r\n\r\n\r\nVON MEYER\r\n\r\nBut the German interpretation is not uniform, and Hermann von Meyer, the\r\nbanker-naturalist of Frankfurt a./M., who made himself conversant with\r\nall that his predecessors knew, and enlarged knowledge of the\r\nPterodactyles on the most critical facts of structure, continued to\r\nregard them as true reptiles, but flying reptiles. Such is the influence\r\nof von Meyer that all parts of the world have shown a disposition to\r\nreflect his opinions, especially as they practically coincide with the\r\nearlier teaching of Cuvier. Owen and Huxley in England, Cope and Marsh\r\nin America, Gaudry in France, and Zittel in Germany have all placed the\r\nPterodactyles as flying reptiles. Their judgment is emphatic. But there\r\nis weight of competent opinion to endorse the evolutionary teaching of\r\nGoldfuss that they rise above reptiles. To form an independent opinion\r\nthe modern student must examine the animals, weigh their characters bone\r\nby bone, familiarise himself, if possible, with some of the rocks in\r\nwhich they are found; to comprehend the conditions under which the\r\nfossils are preserved, which have added not a little to the interest in\r\nPterodactyles, and to the difficulty of interpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF PTERODACTYLES IN GERMANY\r\n\r\nWe may briefly recapitulate the geological history. Those remains of\r\nOrnithosaurs which have been mentioned, with a multitude of others which\r\nare the glory of the museums of Munich, Stuttgart, Tuebingen,\r\nHeidelberg, Bonn, Haarlem, and London, have all been found in working\r\nthe lithographic stone of Bavaria. The whitish yellow limestone forms\r\nlow, flat-topped hills, now isolated from each other by natural\r\ndenudation, which has removed the intervening rock. The stone is found\r\nat some distance north of the Danube, in a line due north of Augsburg,\r\nin the country about Pappenheim, and especially at the villages of\r\nSolenhofen, Eichstaedt, Kelheim, and Nusplingen. These beds belong to the\r\nrocks which are named White Jura limestone in Germany, which is of about\r\nthe same geological age as the Kimeridge clay in England. Much of it\r\ndivides into very thin layers, and in these planes of separation the\r\nfossils are found. They include the _Ammonites lithographicus_ and a\r\nmultitude of marine shells, king crabs and other Crustacea, sea-urchins,\r\nand other fossils, showing that the deposit was formed in the sea. The\r\npreservation of jelly-fish, which so soon disappear when left dry on the\r\nbeach, shows that the ancient calcareous mud had unusual power of\r\npreserving fossils. Into this sea, with its fishes great and small, came\r\nland plants from off the land, dragonflies and other insects, tortoises\r\nand lizards, Pterodactyles with their flying organs, and birds still\r\nclothed with feathers. Sometimes the wing membranes of the flying\r\nreptiles are found fully stretched by the wing finger, as in examples to\r\nbe seen at Munich and in the Yale Museum in Newhaven, in America. At\r\nHaarlem there is an example in which the wing membrane appears to be\r\nfolded much as in the wing of a Bat, when the animal hangs suspended,\r\nwith the flying membrane bent into a few wide undulations.\r\n\r\nThe Solenhofen Slate belongs to about the middle period of the history\r\nof flying reptiles, for they range through the Secondary epochs of\r\ngeological time. Remains are recorded in Germany from the Keuper beds at\r\nthe top of the Trias, which is the bottom division of the Secondary\r\nstrata; and I believe I have seen fragments of their bones from the\r\nsomewhat older Muschelkalk of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR HISTORY IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nIn England the remains are found for the first time in the Lower Lias of\r\nLyme Regis, in Dorset, and the Upper Lias of Whitby, in Yorkshire. In\r\nWuertemberg they occur on the same horizons. They reappear in England, in\r\nevery subsequent age, when the conditions of the strata and their\r\nfossils give evidence of near proximity to land. In the Stonesfield\r\nSlate of Stonesfield, in Oxfordshire, the bones are found isolated, but\r\nindicate animals of some size, though not so large as the rare bones of\r\nreputed true birds which appear to have left their remains in the same\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\nAt least two Pterodactyles are found in the Oxford clay, known from more\r\nor less fragmentary remains or isolated bones; just as they occur in the\r\nKimeridge Clay, Purbeck Limestone, Wealden sandstones, and especially in\r\nnewer Secondary rocks, named Gault, Upper Greensand, and Chalk, in the\r\nsouth-east of England.\r\n\r\nOwing to exceptional facilities for collecting, in consequence of the\r\nCambridge Greensand being excavated for the valuable mineral phosphate\r\nof lime it contains, more than a thousand bones are preserved, more or\r\nless broken and battered, in the Woodwardian Museum of the University\r\nof Cambridge alone. To give some idea of their abundance, it may be\r\nstated that they were mostly gathered during two or three years, as a\r\nmatter of business, by an intelligent foreman of washers of the nodules\r\nof phosphate of lime, which, in commerce, are named coprolites. He soon\r\nlearned to distinguish Pterodactyle bones from other fossils by their\r\ntexture, and learned the anatomical names of bones from specimens in the\r\nUniversity Museum. This workman, Mr. Pond, employed by Mr. William\r\nFarren, brought together not only the best of the remains at Cambridge,\r\nbut most of those in the museums at York and in London, and the\r\nthousands of less perfect specimens in public and private collections\r\nwhich passed through the present writer's hands in endeavours to secure\r\nfor the University useful illustrations of the animal's structure. These\r\nfragments, among which there are few entire bones, are valuable, for\r\nthey have afforded opportunities of examining the articular ends of\r\nbones in every aspect, which is not possible when similar organic\r\nremains are embedded in rock in their natural connexions.\r\n\r\nIn England Flying Reptiles disappear with the Chalk. In that period they\r\nwere widely distributed, being found in Bohemia, in Brazil, and Kansas\r\nin the United States, as well as in Kent and other parts of England.\r\nThey attained their largest dimensions in this period of geological\r\ntime. One imperfect fragment of a bone from the Laramie rocks of Canada\r\nwas described, I believe, by Cope, though not identified by him as\r\nOrnithosaurian, and is probably newer than other remains.\r\n\r\n\r\nASPECT OF PTERODACTYLES\r\n\r\nIf this series of animals could all be brought together they would vary\r\ngreatly in aspect and stature, as well as in structure. Some have the\r\nhead enormously long, in others it is large and deep, characters which\r\nare shared by extinct reptiles which do not fly, and to which some birds\r\nmay approximate; while in a few the head is small and compact, no more\r\nconspicuous, relatively, than the head of a Sparrow. The neck may be\r\nslender like that of a Heron, or strong like that of an Eagle; the back\r\nis always short, and the tail may be inconspicuous, or as long as the\r\nback and neck together. These flying reptiles frequently have the\r\nproportions of the limbs similar to those of a Bat, with fore legs\r\nstrong and hind legs relatively small; while in some the limbs are as\r\nlong, proportionately, and graceful as those of a Deer. With these\r\ndifferences in proportions of the body are associated great differences\r\nin the relative length of the wing and spread of the wing membranes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIMENSIONS OF THE ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the animals have probably varied in all periods of\r\ngeological time. The smallest, in the Lithographic Slate, are smaller\r\nthan Sparrows, while associated with them are others in which the\r\ndrumstick bone of the leg is eight inches long. In the Cambridge\r\nGreensand and Chalk imperfect specimens occur, showing that the upper\r\narm bones are larger than those of an Ox. The shaft is one and a half\r\ninches in diameter and the ends three inches wide. Such remains may\r\nindicate Pterodactyles not inferior in size to the extinct Moas of New\r\nZealand, but with immensely larger heads, animals far larger than birds\r\nof flight.\r\n\r\nThe late Sir Richard Owen, on first seeing these fragmentary remains,\r\nsaid \"the flying reptile with outstretched pinions must have appeared\r\nlike the soaring Roc of Arabian romance, but with the features of\r\nleathern wings with crooked claws superinduced, and gaping mouth with\r\nthreatening teeth.\" Eventually we shall obtain more exact ideas of their\r\naspect, when the structures of the several regions of the body have been\r\nexamined. The great dimensions of the stretch of wing, often computed at\r\ntwenty feet in the larger examples, might lead to expectations of great\r\nweight of body, if it were not known that an albatross, with wings\r\nspreading eleven feet, only weighs about seventeen pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nHOW ANIMALS ARE INTERPRETED BY THEIR BONES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is only one safe path which the naturalist may follow who would\r\ntell the story of the meaning and nature of an extinct type of animal\r\nlife, and that is to compare it as fully as possible in its several\r\nbones, and as a whole, with other animals, especially with those which\r\nsurvive. It is easy to fix the place in nature of living animals and\r\ndetermine their mutual relations to each other, because all the\r\norgans--vital as well as locomotive--are available for comparison. On\r\nsuch evidence they are grouped together into the large divisions of\r\nBeasts, Birds, and Reptiles; as well as placed in smaller divisions\r\ntermed Orders, which are based upon less important modifications of\r\nfundamental structures. All these characteristic organs have usually\r\ndisappeared in the fossil. Hence a new method of study of the hard parts\r\nof the skeleton, which alone are preserved, is used in the endeavour to\r\ndiscover how the Flying Reptile or other extinct animal is to be\r\nclassified, and how it acquired its characters or came into existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATIONS OF BONES AMONG MAMMALIA\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.  THE FORE LIMB IN FOUR TYPES OF MAMMALS\r\n\r\n  Comparison of the fore limb in mammals, showing variation of form\r\n  of the bones with function]\r\n\r\nResemblances and differences in the bones are easily over-estimated in\r\nimportance as evidence of pedigree relationship. The Mammalia show, by\r\nmeans of such skeletons as are exhibited in any Natural History Museum,\r\nhow small is the importance to be attached to even the existence of any\r\ngroup of bones in determining its grade of organisation. The whole Whale\r\ntribe suckle their young and conform to the distinctive characters in\r\nbrain and lungs which mark them as being mammals. But if there is one\r\npart of the skeleton more than another which distinguishes the Mammalia,\r\nit is the girdle of bones at the hips which supports the hind limbs. It\r\nis characterised by the bone named the ilium being uniformly directed\r\nforward. Yet in the Whale tribe the hip-girdle and the hind limb which\r\nit usually supports are so faintly indicated as to be practically lost;\r\nwhile the fore limb becomes a paddle without distinction of digits, and\r\nis therefore devoid of hoofs or claws, which are usual terminations of\r\nthe extremities in mammals. Yet this swimming paddle, with its\r\nill-defined bones--sometimes astonishing in number, as well as in\r\nfewness of the finger bones--is represented by the burrowing fore limb\r\nof the Mole, which lives underground; by the elongated hoofed legs of\r\nthe Giraffe, which lives on plains; and the extended arm and finger\r\nbones of the Bat, which are equally mammals with the Whale. From such\r\ncomparison it is seen that no proportion, or form, or length, or use of\r\nthe bones of the limbs, or even the presence of limbs, is necessarily\r\ncharacteristic of a mammal. No limitation can be placed upon the\r\npossible diversity of form or development of bones in unknown animals,\r\nwhen they are considered in the light of such experience of varied\r\nstructural conditions in living members of a single class.\r\n\r\nWhat is true for the limbs and the bony arches which support them is\r\ntrue for the backbone also, for the ribs, and to some extent for the\r\nskull. The neck in the Whale is shortened almost beyond recognition. In\r\nthe Giraffe the same seven vertebrae are elongated into a marvellous\r\nneck; so that in the technical definition of a mammal both are said to\r\nhave seven neck vertebrae. Yet exceptions show a capacity for variation.\r\nOne of the Sloths reduces the number to six, while another has nine\r\nvertebrae in the neck; proving that there is no necessary difference\r\nbetween a mammal and a reptile when judged by a character which is\r\ntypically so distinctive of mammals as the number of the neck bones.\r\n\r\nThe skull varies too, though to a less extent. The Great Ant-eater of\r\nSouth America is a mammal absolutely without teeth. The Porpoises have a\r\nsimple unvarying row of conical teeth with single roots extending along\r\nthe jaw. And the dental armature of the jaws, and relative dimensions of\r\nthe skull bones, exhibit such diversity, in evidence of what may be\r\nparted with or acquired, that recognition of the many reptilian\r\nstructures and bones in the skull of Ornithorhynchus, the Australian\r\nDuckbill, demonstrates that the difficulties in recognising an animal by\r\nits bones are real, unless we can discover the Animal Type to which the\r\nbones belong; and that there is very little in osteology which may not\r\nbe lost without affecting an animal's grade of organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATION IN SKIN COVERING OF MAMMALS\r\n\r\nEven the covering of the body varies in the same class, or even order of\r\nanimals, so that the familiar growth on the skin is never its only\r\npossible covering. The Indian ant-eater, named Manis, which looks like a\r\ngigantic fir-cone, the Armadillo, which sheathes the body in rings of\r\nbone, bearing only a scanty development of hair, are examples of\r\nmammalian hair, as singular as the quills of a Porcupine, the horn of a\r\nRhinoceros, or the growth of hair of varying length and stoutness on\r\ndifferent parts of the body in various animals, or the imperfect\r\ndevelopment of hair in the marine Cetacea. Among living animals it is\r\nenough for practical purposes to say that a mammal is clothed with hair,\r\nbut in a fossil state the hair must usually be lost beyond recognition\r\nfrom its fineness and shortness of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATION IN SKIN COVERING OF BIRDS\r\n\r\nNo Class of living animals is more homogeneous than Birds; and\r\nwell-preserved remains prove that, at least as far back in time as the\r\nUpper Oolites, birds were clothed with feathers of essentially the same\r\nmode of growth and appearance as the feathers of living birds. There\r\nmay, therefore, be no ground for assuming that the covering was ever\r\ndifferent, though some regions of the skin are free from feathers. Yet\r\nthe variations from fine under-down to the scale-like feathers on the\r\nwings of a Penguin, or the great feathers in the wings of birds of\r\nflight, or the double quill of the Ostrich group, are calculated to\r\nyield dissimilar impressions in a fossil state, even if the fine down\r\nwould be preserved in any stratum.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATION IN THE BONES OF BIRDS\r\n\r\nOsteologically there is less variety in the skeleton of birds than in\r\nother great groups of animals. The existing representatives do not\r\nexhaust its capability for modification. The few specimens of birds\r\nhitherto found in the Secondary strata have rudely removed many\r\ndifferences in the bones which separated living birds from reptiles; so\r\nthat if only the older fossil birds were known, and the Tertiary and\r\nliving birds had not existed, a bird might have been defined as an\r\nanimal having its jaw armed with teeth, instead of devoid of teeth; with\r\nvertebrae cupped at both ends, instead of with a saddle-shaped\r\narticulation which in front is concave from side from side, and convex\r\nfrom above downwards; in which the bones of the hand are separate, so\r\nthat three digits terminating in claws can be applied to the ground,\r\ninstead of the metacarpal bones being united in a solid mass with\r\nclawless digits; and in which the tail is elongated like the tail of a\r\nlizard. Yet the limits to variation are not to be formulated till Nature\r\nhas exhausted all her resources in efforts to preserve organic types by\r\nadapting them to changed circumstances. Birds may be regarded\r\ntheoretically as equally capable with mammals of parting with almost\r\nevery distinctive structure in the skeleton by which it is best known.\r\nEven the living frigate bird blends the early joints of the backbone\r\ninto a compact mass like a sacrum. The Penguin has a cup-and-ball\r\narticulation in the early dorsal vertebrae, with the ball in front. And\r\nthe genus Cypselus has the upper arm bone almost as broad as long,\r\nunlike the bird type. Such examples prove that we are apt to accept the\r\npredominant structures in an animal type as though they were universal,\r\nand forget that inferences based, like those of early investigators, on\r\nlimited materials may be re-examined with advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATION IN THE BONES OF REPTILES\r\n\r\nThe true Reptilia, notwithstanding some strong resemblances to Birds in\r\ntechnical characters of the skeleton, display among their surviving\r\nrepresentatives an astonishing diversity in the bony framework of the\r\nbody, exceeding that of the mammalia. This unlooked-for capacity for\r\nvarying the plan of construction of the skeleton is in harmony with the\r\ndiversity of structure in groups of extinct animals to which the name\r\nreptiles has also been given. The interval in form is so vast between\r\nSerpent and Tortoise, and so considerable in structure of the skeleton\r\nbetween these and the several groups of Lizards, Crocodiles, and\r\nHatteria, that any other diversity could not be more surprising. And the\r\ninference is reasonable that just as mammals live in the air, in the\r\nsea, on the earth, and burrow under the earth, similar modes of\r\nexistence might be expected for birds and reptiles, though no bird is\r\nyet known to have put on the aspect of a fish, and no reptiles have been\r\ndiscovered which roamed in herds like antelopes, or lived in the air\r\nlike birds or bats, unless these fossil flying animals prove on\r\nexamination to justify the name by which they are known.\r\n\r\nComparative study of structure in this way demolishes the prejudice,\r\nborn of experience of the life which now remains on earth, that the\r\nideas of Reptile and of Flight are incongruous, and not to be combined\r\nin one animal. The comparative study of the parts of animals does not\r\nleave the student in a chaos of possibilities, but teaches us that\r\norganic structures, which mark the grades of life, have only a limited\r\nscope of change; while Nature flings away every part of the skeleton\r\nwhich is not vital, or changes its form with altering circumstances of\r\nexistence, enforced by revolutions of the Earth's surface in geological\r\ntime, in her efforts to save organisms from extinction and pass the\r\ngrade of life onward to a later age.\r\n\r\nThe bones are only of value to the naturalist as symbols, inherited or\r\nacquired, and vary in value as evidence of the nature and association of\r\nthose vital organs which differentiate the great groups of the\r\nvertebrata.\r\n\r\nThese distinctive structures, which separate Mammals, Birds, and\r\nReptiles, are sometimes demonstrated by the impress of their existence\r\nleft on the bones; or sometimes they may be inferred from the characters\r\nof the skeleton as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nINTERPRETATION OF PTERODACTYLES BY THEIR SOFT PARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANS WHICH FIX AN ANIMAL'S PLACE IN NATURE\r\n\r\nWe shall endeavour to ascertain what marks of its grade of organisation\r\nthe Pterodactyle has to show. The organs which are capable of modifying\r\nthe bones are probably limited to the kidneys, the brain, and the organs\r\nof respiration. It may be sufficient to examine the latter two.\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMATIC FORAMINA IN PTERODACTYLES\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.  HEAD OF THE HUMERUS OF THE PTERODACTYLE\r\n  ORNITHOCHEIRUS\r\n\r\n  Showing position of the pneumatic foramen on the ulnar side of the\r\n  bone as in a bird]\r\n\r\nHermann von Meyer, the historian of the Ornithosaurs of the Lithographic\r\nSlate, as early as 1837 described some Pterodactyle bones from the Lias\r\nof Franconia, which showed that air was admitted into the interior of\r\nthe bones by apertures near their extremities, which, from this\r\ncircumstance, are known as pneumatic foramina. He drew the inference,\r\nnaturally enough, that such a structure is absolute proof that the\r\nPterodactyle was a flying animal. It was not quite the right form in\r\nwhich the conclusion should have been stated, because the Ostrich and\r\nother birds which do not fly have the principal bones pneumatic.\r\nAfterwards, in 1859, the larger bones which Professor Sedgwick, of\r\nCambridge, transmitted to Sir Richard Owen established this condition as\r\ncharacteristic of the Flying Reptiles of the Cambridge Greensand. It was\r\nthus found as a distinctive structure of the bones both at the beginning\r\nand the close of the geological history of these animals. Von Meyer\r\nremarks that the supposition readily follows that in the respiratory\r\nprocess there was some similarity between Pterodactyles and Birds. This\r\ncautious statement may perhaps be due to the circumstance that in many\r\nanimals air cavities are developed in the skull without being connected\r\nwith organs of respiration. It is well known that the bulk of the\r\nElephant's head is due to the brain cavity being protected with an\r\nenvelope formed of large air cells. Small air cells are seen in the\r\nskulls of oxen, pigs, and many other mammals, as well as in the human\r\nforehead. The head of a bird like the Owl owes something of its imposing\r\nappearance to the way in which its mass is enlarged by the dense\r\ncovering of air cells in the bones above the brain, like that seen in\r\nsome Cretaceous Pterodactyles. Nor are the skulls of Crocodiles or\r\nTortoises exceptions to the general rule that an animal's head bones may\r\nbe pneumatic without implying a pneumatic prolongation of air from the\r\nlungs. The mere presence of air cells without specification of the\r\nregion of the skeleton in which they occur is not remarkable. The holes\r\nby which air enters the bones are usually much larger in Pterodactyles\r\nthan in Birds, but the entrance to the air cell prolonged into the bones\r\nis the same in form and position in both groups. So far as can be judged\r\nby this character, there is no difference between them. The importance\r\nof the comparison can only be appreciated by examining the bones side by\r\nside. In the upper arm bone of a bird, on what is known as the ulnar\r\nborder, near to the shoulder joint, and on the side nearest to it, is\r\nthe entrance to the air cell in the humerus. In the Pterodactyle the\r\ncorresponding foramen has the same position, form, and size, and is not\r\none large hole, but a reticulation of small perforations, one beyond\r\nanother, exactly such as are seen in the entrance to the air cell in the\r\nbone of a bird, in which the pneumatic character is found. For it is not\r\nevery bird of flight which has this pneumatic condition of the bones;\r\nand Dr. Crisp stated that quite a number of birds--the Swallow, Martin,\r\nSnipe, Canary, Wood-wren and Willow-wren, Whinchat, Glossy-starling,\r\nSpotted-fly-catcher, and Black-headed Bunting--have no air in their\r\nbones. And it is well known that in many birds, especially water birds,\r\nit is only the upper bones of the limbs which are pneumatic, while the\r\nsmaller bones retain the marrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNGS AND AIR CELLS\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.  LUNGS OF THE BIRD APTERYX PARTLY OPENED ON\r\n  THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE\r\n\r\n  The circles are openings of the bronchial tubes on the surface of the\r\n  lung. The notches on the inner edges of the lungs are impressions of\r\n  the ribs (After R. Owen)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17.  THE BODY OF AN OSTRICH LAID OPEN TO SHOW THE\r\n  AIR CELLS WHICH EXTEND THROUGH ITS LENGTH (After Georges Roche)]\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remember that the lungs of a bird are differently\r\nconditioned from those of any other animal. Instead of hanging freely\r\nsuspended in the cone-shaped chamber of the thorax formed by the ribs\r\nand sternum, they are firmly fixed on each side, so that the ribs deeply\r\nindent them and hold them in place. The lungs have the usual internal\r\nstructure, being made up of branching cells. The chief peculiarity\r\nconsists in the way in which the air passes not only into them, but\r\nthrough them. The air tube of the throat of a bird, unlike that of a\r\nman, has the organ of voice, not at the upper end in the form of a\r\nlarynx, but at the lower end, forming what is termed a syrinx. There is\r\nno evidence of this in a fossil state, although in a few birds the rings\r\nof the trachaea become ossified, and are preserved. But below the syrinx\r\nthe trachaea divides into two bronchi, tubes which carry the ringed\r\ncharacter into the lungs for some distance, and these give off branches\r\ntermed bronchial tubes, the finer subdivisions from which, in their\r\nclustered minute branching sacs, make up the substance of the lung.\r\nThere is nothing exceptional in that. But towards the outer or middle\r\npart of the ventral or under surface of the lungs, four or five rounded\r\nopenings are seen on each side. Each of these openings resembles the\r\nentrance of the air cell into a bone, since it displays several smaller\r\nopenings which lead to it. Each opening from the lung leads to an air\r\ncell. Those cells may be regarded as the blowing out of the membrane\r\nwhich covers the lungs into a film which holds air like a mass of soap\r\nbubbles, until the whole cavity of the body of a bird from neck to tail\r\nis occupied by sacculated air cells, commonly ten in number, five on\r\neach side, though two frequently blend at the base of the neck in the\r\nregion of the #V#-shaped bone named the clavicle or furculum, popularly\r\nknown as the merry-thought. Most people have seen some at least of\r\nthese semi-transparent bladder-like air cells beneath the skin in the\r\nabdominal region of a fowl. The cells have names from their positions,\r\nand on each side one is abdominal, two are thoracic, one clavicular, and\r\none cervical, which last is at the base of the neck. The clavicular and\r\nabdominal air cells are perhaps the most interesting. The air cell\r\ntermed clavicular sends a process outward towards the arm, along with\r\nthe blood vessels which supply the arm. Thus this air cell, entering the\r\nregion of the axilla or arm-pit, enters the upper arm bone usually on\r\nits under side, close to the articular head of the humerus, and in the\r\nsame way the air may pass from bone to bone through every bone in the\r\nfore limb. The hind limbs similarly receive air from the abdominal air\r\ncell, which supplies the femur and other bones of the leg, the sacrum,\r\nand the tail. But the joints of the backbone in front of the sacrum\r\nreceive their air from the cervical air sac. The air cells are not\r\nlimited to the bones, but ramify through the body, and in some cases\r\nextend among the muscles. A bird may be said to breathe not only with\r\nits lungs, but with its whole body. And it is even affirmed that\r\nrespiration has been carried on through a broken arm bone when the\r\nthroat was closed, and the bird under water.\r\n\r\nBirds differ greatly in the extent to which the aircell system prolonged\r\nfrom the lungs is developed, some having the air absent from every bone,\r\nwhile others, like the Swift, are reputed to have air in every bone of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nComparison shows that in so far as the bones are the same in Bird and\r\nOrnithosaur, the evidence of the air cells entering them extends to\r\nresemblance, if not coincidence, in every detail. No living group of\r\nanimals except birds has pneumatic limb bones, in relation to the lungs;\r\nso that it is reasonable to conclude that the identical structures in\r\nthe bones were due to the same cause in both the living and extinct\r\ngroups of animals. It is impossible to say that the lungs were identical\r\nin Birds and Pterodactyles, but so far as evidence goes, there is no\r\nground for supposing them to have been different.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LUNGS OF REPTILES\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18.  THE SIDE OF THE BODY OF A CHAMELEON\r\n\r\n  Ribs removed to show the sacculate branched form of the lung]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing comparable to birds, either in the lungs of living\r\nreptiles or in their relation to the bones. The Chameleon is remarkable\r\nin that the lung is not a simple bladder prolonged through the whole\r\nlength of the body cavity, as in a serpent, but it develops a number of\r\nlarge lateral branches visible when the body is laid open. Except near\r\nthe trachaea, where the tissue has the usual density of a lizard lung,\r\nthe air cell is scarcely more complicated than the air bladder of a\r\nfish, and does not enter into any bone of the skeleton. And although\r\nmany fishes like the Loach have the swim bladder surrounded by bone\r\nconnected with the head, it offers no analogy to the pneumatic condition\r\nof the bones in the Pterodactyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORM OF THE BRAIN CAVITY\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.  THE FORM OF THE BRAIN]\r\n\r\nBut the identity of the pneumatic foramina in Birds and Flying Reptiles\r\nis not a character which stands by itself as evidence of organisation,\r\nfor a mould of the form of the brain case contributes evidence of\r\nanother structural condition which throws some light on the nature of\r\nOrnithosaurs. Among many of the lower animals, such as turtles, the\r\nbrain does not fill the chamber in the dry skull, in which the same\r\nbones are found as are moulded upon the brain in higher animals. For the\r\nbrain case in such reptiles is commonly an envelope of cartilage, as\r\namong certain fishes; and except among serpents, the Ophidia, the bones\r\ndo not completely close the reptilian brain case in front. The brain\r\nfills the brain case completely among birds. A mould from its interior\r\nis almost as definite in displaying the several parts of which it is\r\nformed as the actual brain would be. And the chief regions of the brain\r\nin a bird--cerebrum, optic lobes, cerebellum--show singularly little\r\nvariation in proportion or position. The essential fact in a bird's\r\nbrain, which separates it absolutely from all other animals, is that the\r\npair of nerve masses known as the optic lobes are thrust out at the\r\nsides, so that the large cerebral hemispheres extend partly over them as\r\nthey extend between them to abut against the cerebellum. This remarkable\r\ncondition has no parallel among other vertebrate animals. In Fishes,\r\nAmphibians, Reptiles, and Mammals the linear succession of the several\r\nparts of the brain is never departed from; and any appearance of\r\nvariation from it among mammals is more apparent than real, for the\r\nlinear succession may be seen in the young calf till the cerebral\r\nhemispheres grow upward and lop backward, so as to hide the relatively\r\nsmall brain masses which correspond to the optic lobes of reptiles,\r\nextending over these corpora-quadrigemina, as they are named, so as to\r\ncover more or less of the mass of the cerebellum. From these conditions\r\nof the brain and skull, it would not be possible to mistake a mould\r\nfrom the brain case of a bird for that of a reptile, though in some\r\nconditions of preservation it is conceivable that the mould of the brain\r\nof a bird might be distinguished with difficulty from that of the brain\r\nin the lowest mammals. Taken by itself, the avian form of brain in an\r\nanimal would be as good evidence that its grade of organisation was that\r\nof a bird as could be offered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRAIN IN SOLENHOFEN PTERODACTYLES\r\n\r\nIt happens that moulds of the brain of Pterodactyles, more or less\r\ncomplete, are met with of all geological ages--Liassic, Oolitic, and\r\nCretaceous. The Solenhofen Slate is the only deposit in Europe in which\r\nPterodactyle skulls can be said to be fairly numerous. They commonly\r\nhave the bones so thin as to show the form of the upper surface of the\r\nmould of the brain, or the bones have scaled off the mould, or remain in\r\nthe counterpart slab of stone, so as to lay bare the shape of the brain\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum at Heidelberg a skull of this kind is seen in the\r\nlong-tailed genus of Pterodactyles named Rhamphorhynchus. It shows the\r\nlarge rounded cerebral hemispheres, which extend in front of cerebral\r\nmasses of smaller size a little below them in position, which perhaps\r\nare as like the brain of a monotreme mammal as a bird.\r\n\r\nThe short-tailed Pterodactylus described by Cuvier has the cerebral\r\nhemispheres very similar to those of a bird, but the relations of the\r\nhinder parts of the brain to each other are less clear.\r\n\r\nThe first specimen to show the back of the brain was found by Mr. John\r\nFrancis Walker, M.A., in the Cambridge Greensand. I was able to remove\r\nthe thick covering of cellular bone which originally extended above it,\r\nand thus expose evidence that in the mutual relations of the fore and\r\nhind parts of the brain bird and ornithosaur were practically identical.\r\nAnother Cambridge Greensand skull showed that in the genus\r\nOrnithocheirus the optic lobes of the brain are developed laterally, as\r\nin birds. That skull was isolated and imperfect. But about the same time\r\nthe late Rev. W. Fox, of Brixton, in the Isle of Wight, obtained from\r\nWealden beds another skull, with jaws, teeth, and the principal bones of\r\nthe skeleton, which showed that the Wealden Pterodactyle Ornithodesmus\r\nhad a similar and bird-like brain. In 1888 Mr. E. T. Newton, F.R.S.,\r\nobtained a skull from the Upper Lias, uncrushed and free from\r\ndistortion. This made known the natural mould of the brain, which shows\r\nthe cerebral hemispheres, optic lobes, and cerebellum more distinctly\r\nthan in the specimens previously known. In some respects it recalls the\r\nHeidelberg brain of Rhamphorhynchus in the apparently transverse\r\nsubdivision of the optic lobes, but it is unmistakably bird-like, and\r\nquite unlike any reptile.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE BRAIN AND BREATHING ORGANS\r\n\r\nSo far as the evidence goes, it appears that these fossil flying animals\r\nshow no substantial differences from birds, either in the mould of the\r\nbrain or the impress of the breathing organs upon the bones. These\r\napproximations to birds of the nervous and respiratory systems, which\r\nare beyond question two of the most important of the vital organs of an\r\nanimal, and distinctive beyond all others of birds, place the\r\nnaturalist in a singular dilemma. He must elect whether he will trust\r\nhis interpretation to the soft organs, which among existing animals\r\nnever vary their type in the great classes of vertebrate animals, and on\r\nwhich the animal is defined as something distinct from its envelope the\r\nskeleton and its appendages the limbs, or whether he will ignore them.\r\nThe answer must choose substantially between belief that the existing\r\norder of Nature gives warrant for believing that these vital\r\ncharacteristics which have been discussed might equally coexist with the\r\nskeleton of a mammal or a reptile, as with that of a bird, for which\r\nthere is no particle of evidence in existing life. Or, as an\r\nalternative, the fact must be accepted that birds only have such vital\r\norgans as are here found, and therefore the skeleton, that may be\r\nassociated with them, cannot affect the reference of the type to the\r\nsame division of the animal kingdom as birds. The decision need not be\r\nmade without further consideration. But brain and breathing organs of\r\nthe avian type are structures of a different order of stability in most\r\nanimals from the bones, which vary to a remarkable extent in almost\r\nevery ordinal group of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE OF THE BLOOD\r\n\r\nThe organs of circulation and digestion are necessarily unknown. There\r\nare reasons why the blood may have been hot, such as the evidences from\r\nthe wings of exceptional activity; though the temperature depends more\r\nupon the amount of blood in the body than upon the apparatus by which it\r\nis distributed. We speak of a Crocodile as cold-blooded, yet it is an\r\nanimal with a four-chambered heart not incomparable with that of a\r\nbird. On the other hand, the Tunny, a sort of giant Mackerel, is a fish\r\nwith a three-chambered heart, only breathing the air dissolved in water,\r\nwhich has blood as warm as a mammal, its temperature being compared to\r\nthat of a pig. Several fishes have blood as warm as that of Manis, the\r\nscaly ant-eater; and many birds have hotter blood than mammals. The term\r\n\"hot-blooded,\" as distinct from \"cold-blooded,\" applied to animals, is\r\nrelative to the arbitrary human standard of experience, and expresses no\r\nmore than the circumstance that mammals and birds are warmer animals\r\nthan reptiles and fishes.\r\n\r\nThe exceptional temperature of the Flying Fish has led to a vague\r\nimpression that physical activity and its effect upon the amount of\r\nblood which vigour of movement circulates, are more important in raising\r\nan animal's temperature than possession of the circulatory organs\r\ncommonly associated with hot blood, which drive the blood in distinct\r\ncourses through the body and breathing organs. Yet the kind of heart\r\nwhich is always associated with vital structures such as Pterodactyles\r\nare inferred to have possessed from the brain mould and the pneumatic\r\nforamina in the bones, is the four-chambered heart of the bird and the\r\nmammal. Considering these organs alone--of which the fossil bones yield\r\nevidence--we might anticipate, by the law of known association of\r\nstructures, that nothing distinctly reptilian existed in the other soft\r\npart of the vital organisation, because there is no evidence in favour\r\nof or against such a possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE PLAN OF THE SKELETON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these animals are incontestably nearer to birds than to any other\r\nanimals in their plan of organisation, thus far no proof has been found\r\nthat they are birds, or can be included in the same division of\r\nvertebrate life with feathered animals. It is one of the oldest and\r\nsoundest teachings of Linnaeus that a bird is known by its feathers; and\r\nthe record is a blank as to any covering to the skin in Pterodactyles.\r\nThere is the strongest probability against feathers having existed such\r\nas are known in the Archaeopteryx, because every Solenhofen Ornithosaur\r\nappears to have the body devoid of visible or preservable covering,\r\nwhile the two birds known from the Solenhofen Slate deposit are well\r\nclothed with feathers in perfect preservation. We turn from the skin to\r\nthe skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe plan on which the skeleton is constructed remains as evidence of the\r\nanimal's place in nature, which is capable of affording demonstration on\r\nwhich absolute reliance would have been placed, if the brain and\r\npneumatic foramina had remained undiscovered. With the entire skeleton\r\nbefore us, it is inconceivable that anatomical science should fail to\r\ndiscover the true nature of the animal to which it belonged, by the\r\nmethod of comparing one animal with another. There is no lack of this\r\nkind of evidence of Pterodactyles in the three or four scores of\r\nskeletons, and thousands of isolated or associated bones, preserved in\r\nthe public museums of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nI may recall the circumstance that the discovery of skeletons of fossil\r\nanimals has occasionally followed upon the interpretation of a single\r\nfragment, from which the animal has been well defined, and sometimes\r\naccurately drawn, before it was ever seen. So I propose, before drawing\r\nany conclusions from the skeletons in the entirety of their\r\nconstruction, to examine them bone by bone, and region by region, for\r\nevidence that will manifest the nature of this brood of Dragons. Their\r\nliving kindred, and perhaps their extinct allies, assembled as a jury,\r\nmay be able to determine whether resemblances exist between them, and\r\nwhether such similarity between the bones as exists is a common\r\ninheritance, or is a common acquisition due to similar ways of life, and\r\nno evidence of the grade of the organism among vertebrate animals.\r\n\r\nThe bones of these Ornithosaurs, when found isolated, first have to be\r\nseparated from the organisms with which they are associated and mixed in\r\nthe geological strata. This discrimination is accomplished in the first\r\ninstance by means of the texture of the surface. The density and polish\r\nof the bones is even more marked than in the bones of birds, and is\r\nusually associated with a peculiar thinness of substance of the bone,\r\nwhich is comparable to the condition in a bird, though usually a little\r\nstouter, so that the bones resist crushing better. Pterodactyle bones\r\nin many instances are recognised by their straightness and comparatively\r\nuniform dimensions, due to the exceptional number of long bones which\r\nenter into the structure of the wing as compared with birds. When the\r\nbones are unerringly determined as Ornithosaurian, they are placed side\r\nby side with all the bones which are most like them, till, judged by the\r\nstandard of the structures of living animals, the fossil is found to\r\nshow a composite construction as though it were not one animal but many,\r\nwhile its individual bones often show equally composite characters, as\r\nthough parts of the corresponding bone in several animals had been\r\ncunningly fitted together and moulded into shape.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLAN OF THE HEAD IN ORNITHOSAURS\r\n\r\nThe head is always the most instructive part of an animal. It is less\r\nthan an inch long in the small Solenhofen skeleton named _Pterodactylus\r\nbrevirostris_, and is said to be three feet nine inches long in the\r\ntoothless Pterodactyle Ornithostoma from the Chalk of Kansas. Most of\r\nthese animals have a long, slender, conical form of head, tapering to\r\nthe point like the beak of a Heron, forming a long triangle when seen\r\nfrom above or from the side. Sometimes the head is depressed in front,\r\nwith the beak flattened or rounded as in a Duck or Goose, and\r\noccasionally in some Wealden and Greensand species the jaws are\r\ntruncated in front in a massive snout quite unlike any bird. The back of\r\nthe head is sometimes rounded as among birds, showing a smooth\r\npear-shaped posterior convexity in the region of the brain. Sometimes\r\nthe back of the head is square and vertical or oblique. Occasionally a\r\ngreat crest of cellular tissue is extended backward from above the\r\nbrain case over the spines of the neck bones.\r\n\r\nThere are always from two to four lateral openings in the skull. First,\r\nthe nostril is nearest to the extremity of the beak. Secondly, the\r\norbits of the eyes are placed far backward. These two openings are\r\nalways present. The nostril may incline upward. The orbits of the eyes\r\nare usually lateral, though their upper borders sometimes closely\r\napproximate, as in the woodpecker-like types from the Solenhofen Slate\r\nnamed _Pterodactylus Kochi_, now separated as another genus. In most\r\ngenera there is an opening in the side of the head, between the eye hole\r\nand the nostril, known as the antorbital vacuity; and another opening,\r\nwhich is variable in size and known as the temporal vacuity, is placed\r\nbehind the eye. The former is common in the skulls of birds, the latter\r\nis absent from all birds and found in many reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe palate is usually imperfectly seen, but English and American\r\nspecimens have shown that it has much in common with the palate in\r\nbirds, though it varies greatly in form of the bones in representatives\r\nfrom the Lias, Oolites, and Cretaceous rocks.\r\n\r\nFrom the scientific aspect the relative size of the head, its form, and\r\nthe positions and dimensions of its apertures and processes, are of\r\nlittle importance in comparison with its plan of construction, as\r\nevidenced by the positions and relations to each other of the bones of\r\nwhich it is formed. There usually is some difficulty in stating the\r\nlimits of the bones of the skull, because in Pterodactyles, as among\r\nbirds, they usually blend together, so that in the adult animal the\r\nsutures between the bones are commonly obliterated.\r\n\r\nBones have relations to each other and places in the head which can only\r\nchange as the organs with which they are associated change their\r\npositions. No matter what the position of a nostril may be--at the\r\nextremity of a long snout, as in an ant-eater, or far back at the top of\r\nthe head in a porpoise, or at the side of the head in a bird--it is\r\nalways bordered by substantially the same bones, which vary in length\r\nand size with the changing place of the nostril and the form of the\r\nhead. Every region of the head is defined by this method of\r\nconstruction; so that eye holes and nose holes, brain case and jaw\r\nbones, palate and teeth, beak, and back of the skull are all instructive\r\nto those who seek out the life-history of these animals. We may briefly\r\nexamine the head of an Ornithosaurian.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONES ABOUT THE NOSTRIL\r\n\r\nNo matter what its form may be, the head of an Ornithosaur always\r\nterminates in front in a single bone called the intermaxillary. It sends\r\na bar of bone backward above the visible nostrils, between them; and a\r\nbar on each side forms the margin of the jaw in which teeth are\r\nimplanted. The bone varies in depth, length, sharpness, bluntness,\r\nslenderness, and massiveness. As the bone becomes long the jaw is\r\ncompressed from side to side, and the openings of the nostrils are\r\nremoved backward to an increasing distance from the extremity of the\r\nbeak.\r\n\r\nThe outer and hinder border of the nostril is made by another bone named\r\nthe maxillary bone, which is usually much shorter than the premaxillary.\r\nIt contains the hindermost teeth, which rarely differ from those in\r\nfront, except in sometimes being smaller.\r\n\r\nThe nasal bones, which always make the upper and hinder border of the\r\nnostrils, meet each other above them, in the middle line of the beak.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20\r\n\r\n  Showing that the extremity of the jaws in Rhamphorhynchus was\r\n  sheathed in horn as in the giant Kingfisher, since the jaws\r\n  similarly gape in front.\r\n\r\n  The hyoid bones are below the lower jaw in the Pterodactyle.]\r\n\r\nThe nostrils are unusually large in the Lias genus named Dimorphodon,\r\nand small in species of the genus Rhamphorhynchus from Solenhofen. Such\r\ndifferences result from the relative dimensions and proportions of these\r\nthree bones which margin the nasal vacuity, and by varying growth of\r\ntheir front margins or of their hinder margins govern the form of the\r\nsnout.\r\n\r\nThe jaws are most massive in the genera known from the Wealden beds to\r\nthe Chalk. The palatal surface is commonly flat or convex, and often\r\nmarked by an elevated median ridge which corresponds to a groove in the\r\nlower jaw, though the median ridge sometimes divides the palate into two\r\nparallel concave channels. The jaw is margined with teeth which are\r\nrarely fewer than ten or more than twenty on each side. They are sharp,\r\ncompressed from side to side, curved inward, and never have a saw-like\r\nedge on the back and front margins. No teeth occur upon the bones of the\r\npalate.\r\n\r\nIn most birds there is a large vacuity in the side of the head between\r\nthe nostril and the orbit of the eye, partly separated from it by the\r\nbone which carries the duct for tears named the lachrymal bone. The same\r\npreorbital vacuity is present in all long-tailed Pterodactyles, though\r\nit is either less completely defined or absent in the group with short\r\ntails. It affords excellent distinctive characters for defining the\r\ngenera. In the long-tailed genus Scaphognathus from Solenhofen this\r\npreorbital opening is much larger than the nostril, while in Dimorphodon\r\nthese vacuities are of about equal size. Rhamphorhynchus is\r\ndistinguished by the small size of the antorbital vacuity, which is\r\nplaced lower than the nostril on the side of the face. The aperture is\r\nalways imperfectly defined in Pterodactylus, and is a relatively small\r\nvacuity compared with the long nostril. In Ptenodracon the antorbital\r\nvacuity appears to have no existence separate from the nostril which\r\nadjoins the eye hole. And so far as is known at present there is no\r\nlateral opening in advance of the eye in the skull in any Ornithosaur\r\nfrom Cretaceous rocks, though the toothless Ornithostoma is the only\r\ngenus with the skull complete. When a separate antorbital vacuity\r\nexists, it is bordered by the maxillary bone in front, and by the malar\r\nbone behind. The prefrontal bone is at its upper angle. That bone is\r\nknown in a separate state in reptiles and, I think, in monotreme\r\nmammals. Its identity is soon lost in the mammal, and its function in\r\nthe skull is different from the corresponding bone in Pterodactyles.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONES ABOUT THE EYES\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 21.  UPPER SURFACE OF SKULL OF THE HERON\r\n\r\n  Compared with the same aspect of the skull of Rhamphorhynchus]\r\n\r\nThe third opening in the side of the head, counting from before\r\nbackward, is the orbit of the eye. In this vacuity is often seen the\r\nsclerotic circle of overlapping bones formed in the external membrane of\r\nthe eye, like those in nocturnal birds and some reptiles. The eye hole\r\nvaries in form from an inverted pear-shape to an oblique or transverse\r\noval, or a nearly circular outline. It is margined by the frontal bone\r\nabove; the tear bone or lachrymal, and the malar or cheek bone in front;\r\nwhile the bones behind appear to be the quadrato-jugal and post-frontal\r\nbones, though the bones about the eye are somewhat differently arranged\r\nin different genera.\r\n\r\nThe eyes were frequently, if not always, in contact with the anterior\r\nwalls of the brain case, as in many birds, and are always far back in\r\nthe side of the head. In Dimorphodon they are in front of the\r\narticulation of the lower jaw; in Rhamphorhynchus, above that\r\narticulation; while in Ornithostoma they are behind the articulation for\r\nthe jaw. This change is governed by the position of the quadrate bone,\r\nwhich is vertical in the Lias genus, inclined obliquely forward in the\r\nfossils from the Oolites, and so much inclined in the Chalk fossil that\r\nthe small orbit is thrown relatively further back.\r\n\r\nThus far the chief difference in the Pterodactyle skull from that of a\r\nbird is in the way in which the malar arch is prolonged backward on each\r\nside. It is a slender bar of bone in birds, without contributing\r\nascending processes to border vacuities in the side of the face, while\r\nin these fossil animals the lateral openings are partly separated by the\r\nascending processes of these bones. This divergence from birds, in the\r\nmalar bone entering the orbit of the eye is approximated to among\r\nreptiles and mammals, though the conditions, and perhaps the presence of\r\na bone like the post-orbital bone, are paralleled only among Reptiles.\r\nThe Pterodactyles differ among themselves enough for the head to make a\r\nnear approach to Reptiles in Dimorphodon, and to Birds in\r\nPterodactylus. In the Ground Hornbill and the Shoebill the lachrymal\r\nbones in front of the orbits of the eyes grow down to meet the malar\r\nbars without uniting with them. The post-frontal region also is\r\nprolonged downward almost as far as the malar bar, as though to show\r\nthat a bird might have its orbital circle formed in the same way and by\r\nthe same bones as in Pterodactylus. Cretaceous Ornithosaurs sometimes\r\ndiffer from birds apparently in admitting the quadrato-jugal bone into\r\nthe orbit. It then becomes an expanded plate, instead of a slender bar\r\nas in all birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPORAL FOSSA\r\n\r\nA fourth vacuity is known as the temporal fossa. When the skull of such\r\na mammal as a Rabbit, or Sheep, is seen from above, there is a vacuity\r\nbehind the orbits for the eyes, which in life is occupied by the muscles\r\nwhich work the lower jaw. It is made by the malar bone extending from\r\nthe back of the orbit and the process of bone, called the zygomatic\r\nprocess, extending forward from the articulation of the jaw, which\r\narches out to meet the malar bone.\r\n\r\nIn birds there is no conspicuous temporal fossa, because the malar bar\r\nis a slender rod of bone in a line with the lower end of the quadrate\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nReptile skulls have sometimes one temporal vacuity on each side, as\r\namong tortoises, formed by a single lateral bar. These vacuities, which\r\ncorrespond to those of mammals in position, are seen from the top of the\r\nhead, as lateral vacuities behind the orbits of the eyes, and are termed\r\nsuperior temporal vacuities. In addition to these there is often in\r\nother reptiles a lateral opening behind the eye, termed the inferior\r\ntemporal vacuity, seen in Crocodiles, in Hatteria, and in Lizards; and\r\nin such skulls there are two temporal bars seen in side view,\r\ndistinguished as superior and inferior. The superior arch always\r\nincludes the squamosal bone, which is at the back of the single bar in\r\nmammals. The lower arch includes the malar bone, which is in front in\r\nthe single arch of mammals. The circumstance that both these arches are\r\nconnected with the quadrate bone makes the double temporal arch\r\neminently reptilian.\r\n\r\nIn Ornithosaurs the lateral temporal vacuity varies from a typically\r\nreptilian condition to one which, without becoming avian, approaches the\r\nbird type. In skulls from the Lias, Dimorphodon and Campylognathus,\r\nthere is a close parallel to the living New Zealand reptile Hatteria, in\r\nthe vertical position of the quadrate bone and in the large size of the\r\nvacuity behind and below the eye, which extends nearly the height of the\r\nskull. In the species of the genus Pterodactylus, the forward\r\ninclination of the quadrate bone recalls the Curlew, Snipe, and other\r\nbirds. The back of the head is rounded, and the squamosal bone, which\r\nappears to enter into the wall of the brain case as in birds and\r\nmammals, is produced more outward than in birds, but less than in\r\nmammals, so as to contribute a little to the arch which is in the\r\nposition of the post-frontal bone of reptiles. It is triangular, and\r\nstretches from the outer angle of the frontal bone at the back of the\r\norbit to the squamosal behind, where it also meets the quadrate bone.\r\nIts third lower branch meets the quadratojugal, which rests upon the\r\nfront of the quadrate bone, as in Iguanodon, and is unlike Dimorphodon\r\nin its connexions. In that genus the supra-temporal bone, or\r\npost-orbital bone, appears to rest upon the post-frontal and connect it\r\nwith the quadrato-jugal. In Dimorphodon the malar bone is entirely\r\nremoved from the quadrate, but in Pterodactylus it meets its articular\r\nend. Between the post-frontal bone above and the quadrato-jugal bone\r\nbelow is a small lunate opening, which represents the lateral temporal\r\nvacuity; and so far, this is a reptilian character. But if the thin\r\npost-frontal bone were absorbed, Pterodactylus would resemble birds.\r\nThere is no evidence that the quadrate bone is free in any Ornithosaurs,\r\nas it is in all birds, while in Dimorphodon it unites by suture with the\r\nsquamosal bone. In Ornithostoma the lateral temporal vacuity is little\r\nmore than a slit between the quadrate bone below, the quadrato-jugal in\r\nfront, and what may be the post-frontal bone behind (see Fig. 2, p. 12).\r\n\r\n\r\nBONES ABOUT THE BRAIN\r\n\r\nThe bones containing the brain appear to be the same as form the brain\r\ncase in birds. The form of the back of the skull varies in two ways.\r\nFirst it may be flat above and flat at the back, when the back of the\r\nhead appears to be square. This condition is seen in all the long-tailed\r\ngenera, such as Campylognathus from the Lias and Rhamphorhynchus, and is\r\nassociated with a high position for the upper temporal bar. Secondly,\r\nthe back of the head may be rounded convexly, both above and behind.\r\nThat condition is seen in the short-tailed genera, such as\r\nPterodactylus. But in the large Cretaceous types, such as Ornithocheirus\r\nand Ornithostoma, the superior longitudinal ridge which runs back in\r\nthe middle line of the face becomes elevated and compressed from side to\r\nside at the back of the head as a narrow deep crest, prolonged backward\r\nover the neck vertebrae for some inches of length. All these three types\r\nare paralleled more or less in birds which have the back of the head\r\nsquare like the Heron, or rounded like the Woodpecker; or crested,\r\nthough the crest of the Cormorant is not quite identical with\r\nOrnithocheirus, being a distinct bone at the back of the head in the\r\nbird which never blends with the skull. In so far as the crest is\r\nreptilian it suggests the remarkable crest of the Chameleon. In the\r\nstructure of the back of the skull the bones are a modification of the\r\nreptilian type of Hatteria in the Lias genus Campylognathus, but the\r\nreptilian characters appear to be lost in the less perfectly preserved\r\nskulls of Cretaceous genera.\r\n\r\nThe palate is well known in the chief groups of Ornithosaurs, such as\r\nCampylognathus, Scaphognathus, and Cycnorhamphus.\r\n\r\nMr. E. T. Newton, F.R.S., has shown that in the English skull from the\r\nLias of Whitby, the forms of the bones are similar to the palate in\r\nbirds and unlike the conditions in reptiles. There is one feature,\r\nhowever, which may indicate a resemblance to Dicynodon and other fossil\r\nreptiles from South Africa. A slender bone extends from the base of the\r\nbrain case, named the basi-sphenoid bone, outward and forward to the\r\ninner margin of the quadrate bone (Fig. 22). A bone is found thus placed\r\nin those South African Reptiles, which show many resemblances to the\r\nMonotreme and Marsupial Mammals. It is not an ordinary element of the\r\nskeleton and is unknown in living animals of any kind in that position.\r\nIt has been thought possible that it may represent one of the bones\r\nwhich among mammals are diminutive and are included in the internal ear.\r\nThe resemblance may have some interest hereafter, as helping to show\r\nthat certain affinities of the Ornithosaurs may lie outside the groups\r\nof existing reptiles. Instead of being directed transversely outward, as\r\nin the palatal region of _Dicynodon lacerticeps_, they diverge outward\r\nand forward to the inner border of the articulation for the lower jaw\r\nwhich is upon the quadrate bone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 22]\r\n\r\n\r\nBONES OF THE PALATE\r\n\r\nThere is a pair of bones which extend forward from these inner articular\r\nborders of the quadrate bones, and converge in a long #V#-shape till\r\nthey merge in the hard palate formed by the bones of the front of the\r\nbeak, named intermaxillary and maxillary bones. The limits of the bones\r\nof the palate are not distinct, but there can be no doubt that the\r\nfront of the #V# is the bone named vomer, that the palatine bones are at\r\nits sides, and that its hinder parts are the pterygoid bones as in\r\nbirds. There is a long, wide, four-sided, open space in the middle of\r\nthe palate, between the vomer and the basi-sphenoid bone, unlike\r\nanything in birds or other animals.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marsh, in a figure of the palate in the great skull of the\r\ntoothless Pterodactyle named Ornithostoma (Pteranodon), from the Chalk\r\nof Kansas, found a large oval vacuity in this region of the palate. In\r\nthat genus the pterygoid bones meet each other between the quadrate\r\nbones as in Dicynodon (Fig. 73, p. 182). Hence the great palatal vacuity\r\nhere seen in the Ornithosaur is paralleled by the small vacuity in the\r\nSouth African reptile, which is sometimes distinct and sometimes partly\r\nseparated from the anterior part of the vacuity which forms the openings\r\nof the nostrils on the palate.\r\n\r\nThe Solenhofen skulls which give any evidence of the palate are exposed\r\nin side view only, and the bones, imperfectly seen through the lateral\r\nvacuities, are displaced by crushing. They include long strips like the\r\nvomerine bones in the Lias fossil, and they diverge in the same way as\r\nthey extend back to the quadrate bones. The oblique division into vomer\r\nin front and pterygoid bone behind is shown by Goldfuss in his original\r\nfigure of Scaphognathus. Thus there is some reason for believing that\r\nall Ornithosaurs have the palate formed upon the same general plan,\r\nwhich is on the whole peculiar to the group, especially in not having\r\nthe palatal openings of the nares divided in the middle line. It would\r\nappear probable that the short-tailed animals have the pterygoid bones\r\nmeeting in the middle line and triangular; and that they are slender\r\nrods entirely separate from each other in the long-tailed genera.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEETH\r\n\r\nThe teeth are all of pointed, elongated shape, without distinction into\r\nthe kinds seen in most mammals and named incisors, canines, and\r\ngrinders. They are organs for grasping, like the teeth of the\r\nfish-eating Crocodile of India, and are not unlike the simple teeth of\r\nsome Porpoises. They are often implanted in oblique oval sockets with\r\nraised borders, usually at some distance apart from each other, and have\r\nthe crown pointed, flattened more on the outer side than on the inner\r\nside, usually directed forward and curved inward. As in many extinct\r\nanimals allied to existing reptiles, the teeth are reproduced by germs,\r\nwhich originate on the inner side of the root and grow till they\r\ngradually absorb the substance of the old tooth, forming a new one in\r\nits place. Frequently in Solenhofen genera, like Scaphognathus and\r\nPterodactylus, the successional tooth is seen in the jaw on the hinder\r\nborder of the tooth in use. There is some variation in the character of\r\nbluntness or sharpness of the crowns in the different genera, and in\r\ntheir size.\r\n\r\nThe name Dimorphodon, given to the animal from the Lias of Lyme Regis,\r\nexpresses the fact that the teeth are of two kinds. In the front of the\r\njaw three or four large long teeth are found in the intermaxillary bone\r\non each side, as in some Plesiosaurs, while the teeth found further back\r\nin the maxillary bone are smaller, and directed more vertically\r\ndownward. This difference is more marked in the lower jaw than in the\r\nupper jaw. In Rhamphorhynchus the teeth are all relatively long and\r\nlarge, and directed obliquely forward, but absent from the extremities\r\nof the beak, as in the German genus from the Lias named Dorygnathus, in\r\nwhich the bone of the lower jaw (which alone is known) terminates in a\r\ncompressed spear. In Scaphognathus the teeth are few, more vertical, and\r\ndo not extend backward so far as in Rhamphorhynchus, but are carried\r\nforward to the extremity of the blunt, deep jaw.\r\n\r\nIn the short-tailed Pterodactyles the teeth are smaller, shorter, wider\r\nat the base of the crown, closer together, and do not extend so far\r\nbackward in the jaw. In Ornithocheirus two teeth always project forward\r\nfrom the front of the jaw. Ornithostoma is toothless.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPOSED HORNY BEAK\r\n\r\nSometimes a horny covering has been suggested for the beak, like that\r\nseen in birds or turtles, but no such structure has been preserved, even\r\nin the Solenhofen Slate, in which such a structure would seem as likely\r\nto be preserved as a wing membrane, though there is one doubtful\r\nexception. There are marks of fine blood vessels on some of the jaws,\r\nindicating a tough covering to the bone. In Rhamphorhynchus the jaws\r\nappear to gape towards their extremities as though the interspace had\r\noriginally been occupied by organic substance like a horny beak.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER JAW\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw varies in relative length with the vertical or horizontal\r\nposition of the quadrate bone in the skull. In Dimorphodon the jaw is as\r\nlong as the skull; but in the genera from the Oolitic rocks the\r\nmandible is somewhat shorter, and in Ornithostoma the discrepancy\r\nreaches its maximum. The hinder part of the jaw is never prolonged\r\nbackward much beyond the articulation, differing in this respect from\r\nCrocodiles and Plesiosaurs.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the jaw varies. It is slender in Pterodactylus, and is\r\nprobably stronger relatively to the skull in Scaphognathus than in any\r\nother form. It fits between the teeth and bones of the alveolar border\r\nin the skull, in all the genera. In Dimorphodon its hinder border is\r\npartly covered by the descending edge of the malar process which these\r\nanimals develop in common with some Dinosaurs, and some Anomodont\r\nreptiles, and many of the lower mammals. In this hinder region the lower\r\njaw is sometimes perforated, in the same way as in Crocodiles. That\r\ncondition is observed in Dimorphodon, but is not found in Pterodactylus.\r\nThe lower jaw is always composite, being formed by several bones, as\r\namong reptiles and birds. The teeth are in the dentary bone or bones,\r\nand these bones are almost always blended as in most birds and Turtles,\r\nand not separate from each other as among Crocodiles, Lizards, and\r\nSerpents.\r\n\r\nAn interesting contour for the lower border of the jaw is seen in\r\nOrnithostoma, as made known in figures of American examples by\r\nProfessors Marsh and Williston. It deepens as it extends backwards for\r\ntwo-thirds its length, stops at an angle, and then the depth diminishes\r\nto the articulation with the skull. This angle of the lower jaw is a\r\ncharacteristic feature of the jaws of Mammals. It is seen in the\r\nmonotreme Echidna, and is characteristic of some Theriodont Reptiles\r\nfrom South Africa, which in many ways resemble Mammals. The character\r\nis not seen in the jaws of specimens from the Oolitic rocks, but is\r\ndeveloped in the toothed Ornithocheirus from the Cambridge Greensand,\r\nand is absent from the jaws of existing reptiles and birds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 23  COMPARISON OF THE LOWER JAW IN ECHIDNA AND\r\n  ORNITHOSTOMA]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF CHARACTERS OF THE HEAD\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the head differs from other types of animals in a\r\nblending of characters which at the present day are found among Birds\r\nand Reptiles, with some structures which occur in extinct groups of\r\nanimals with similar affinities, and perhaps a slight indication of\r\nfeatures common to the lowest mammals. It is chiefly upon the head that\r\nthe diverse views of earlier writers have been based. Cuvier was\r\nimpressed with the reptilian aspect of the teeth; but in later times\r\ndiscoveries were made of Birds with teeth--Archaeopteryx, Ichthyornis,\r\nHesperornis. The teeth are quite reptilian, being not unlike miniature\r\nteeth of Mosasaurus. If those birds had been found prior to the\r\ndiscovery of Pterodactyles, the teeth might have been regarded as a link\r\nwith the more ancient birds, rather than a crucial difference between\r\nbirds and reptiles.\r\n\r\nAll the specimens show a lateral temporal hole in the bones behind the\r\neye, and this is found in no bird or mammal, and is typical of such\r\nreptiles as Hatteria. The quadrate bone may not be so decisive as Cuvier\r\nthought it to be, for its form is not unlike the quadrate of a bird, and\r\ndifferent, so far as I have seen, from that of living reptiles. This\r\nregion of the head is reptilian, and if it occurred in a bird the\r\ncharacter would be as astonishing as was the discovery of teeth in\r\nextinct birds. These characters of the head are also found in fossil\r\nanimals named Dinosaurs, in association with many resemblances to birds\r\nin their bones.\r\n\r\nThe palate might conceivably be derived from that of Hatteria by\r\nenlarging the small opening in the middle line in that reptile till it\r\nextended forward between the vomera; but it is more easily compared with\r\na bird, which the animal resembles in its beak, and in the position of\r\nthe nares. Excepting certain Lizards, all true existing Reptiles have\r\nthe nostrils far forward and bordered by two premaxillary bones instead\r\nof one intermaxillary, as in Birds and Ornithosaurs. If nothing were\r\nknown of the animal but its head bones, it would be placed between\r\nReptiles and Birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE BACKBONE, OR VERTEBRAL COLUMN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe backbone is a more deep-seated part of the skeleton than the head.\r\nIt is more protected by its position, and has less varied functions to\r\nperform. Therefore it varies less in distinctive character within the\r\nlimits of each of the classes of vertebrate animals than either the head\r\nor limbs. It is divided into neck bones, the cervical vertebrae; back\r\nbones, the dorsal vertebrae; loin bones, the lumbar vertebrae; the sacrum,\r\nor sacral vertebrae, which support the hind limbs; and the tail. Of these\r\nparts the tail is the least important, though it reaches a length in\r\nexisting reptiles which sometimes exceeds the whole of the remainder of\r\nthe body, and includes hundreds of vertebrae. It attains its maximum\r\namong serpents and lizards. In frogs it is practically absent. In some\r\nof the higher mammals it is a rudiment, which does not extend beyond the\r\nsoft parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NECK\r\n\r\nThe neck is more liable to vary than the back, with the habit of life of\r\nthe animal. And although mammals almost always preserve the same number\r\nof seven bones in the neck, the bones vary in length between the short\r\ncondition of the porpoise, in which the neck is almost lost, and the\r\nlong bones which form the neck of the Llama, though even these may be\r\nexceeded by some fossil reptiles like Tanystrophoeus. In many mammals\r\nthe neck bones do not differ in length or size from those of the back.\r\nIn others, like the Horse and Ox, they are much broader and larger.\r\n\r\nThere is the same sort of variation in the bones of the neck among\r\nbirds, some being slender like the Heron, others broad like the Swan.\r\nBut there is also a singular variation in number of vertebral bones in a\r\nbird's neck. At fewest there are nine, which equals the exceptionally\r\nlarge number found among mammals in the neck of one of the Sloths.\r\nUsually birds have ten to fifteen cervical vertebrae, and in the Swan\r\nthere are twenty-three. Most of the neck bones of birds are relatively\r\nlong, and the length of the neck is often greater than the remainder of\r\nthe vertebral column.\r\n\r\nReptiles usually have short necks. The common Turtle has eight bones in\r\nthe neck, ten in the back. The two regions are sharply defined by the\r\ndorsal shield. Their articular ends are sometimes cupped in front, in\r\nthe neck, sometimes cupped behind, or convex at both ends, or even\r\nflattened, or the articulation may be made exceptionally by the neural\r\narch alone. Nine is the largest number of neck bones in existing\r\nLizards, and there are usually nine in Crocodiles; so that reptiles\r\nclosely approach mammals in number of the neck bones. It is remarkable\r\nthat the maximum number in a mammal and in living reptiles should\r\ncoincide with the minimum number in birds. Therefore the number of\r\ncervical vertebrae as an attribute of Mammal, Bird, or Reptile, can only\r\nbe important from its constancy.\r\n\r\nGerman naturalists affirm on clear evidence that the Solenhofen\r\nPterodactyles have seven cervical vertebrae. In many specimens there can\r\nbe no doubt about the number, because the neck bones are easily\r\ndistinguished from those of the back by their size; but the number is\r\nnot always easy to count.\r\n\r\nAs in Birds, the first vertebra, or atlas, in Pterodactyles is extremely\r\nshort, and is generally--if not always--blended with the much longer\r\nsecond vertebra, named the axis. The front of the atlas forms a small\r\nrounded cup to articulate with the rounded ball of the basioccipital\r\nbone at the back of the skull. The third and fourth vertebrae are longer,\r\nbut the length visibly shortens in the sixth and seventh.\r\n\r\nSometimes the vertebrae are slender and devoid of strong spinous\r\nprocesses. This is the condition in the little _Pterodactylus\r\nlongirostris_ and in the comparatively large _Cycnorhamphus Fraasii_, in\r\nwhich there is a slight median ridge along the upper surface of the arch\r\nof the vertebra. This condition is paralleled in birds with long necks,\r\nespecially wading birds such as the Heron. Other Ornithosaurs, such as\r\nOrnithocheirus from the Cretaceous rocks, have the neck much more\r\nmassive. The vertebrae are flattened on the under side. The arch above\r\nthe nervous matter of the spinal cord has a more or less considerable\r\ntransverse expansion, and may even be as wide as long. These vertebrae\r\nhave proportions and form such as may be seen in Vultures or in the\r\nSwan. In either case the form of the neck bones is more or less\r\nbird-like, and the neural spine may be elevated, especially in\r\nPterodactyles with long tails.\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinctive features of the neck bones of a bird is the\r\nway in which the cervical ribs are blended with the vertebrae. They are\r\nsmall, and each is often prolonged in a needle-like rod at the side of\r\nthe neck bone.\r\n\r\nIn Ornithocheirus the cervical rib similarly blends with the vertebra by\r\ntwo articulations, as in mammals, so that it might escape notice but for\r\nthe channel of a blood vessel which is thus inclosed. In several of the\r\nolder Pterodactyles from Solenhofen the ribs of the neck vertebrae remain\r\nseparated, as in a Crocodile, though still bird-like in their form,\r\nanterior position, and mode of attachment. In Terrapins and Tortoises\r\nthe long neck vertebrae have no cervical ribs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 24  UNITED ATLAS AND AXIS OF ORNITHOCHEIRUS\r\n  (Cambridge Greensand)]\r\n\r\nThe articular surfaces between the bodies of the vertebrae, in the neck,\r\nare transversely oval. The middle part of this articular joint is made\r\nby the body of the vertebra; its outer parts are in the neural arch. In\r\nfront this surface is a hollow channel, often more depressed than in any\r\nother animals. The corresponding surface behind is convex, with a\r\nprocess on each side at its lower outer angles (Fig. 25). It is a\r\nmodification of the cup-and-ball form of vertebral articulation, which\r\nat the present day is eminently reptilian. Serpents and Crocodiles have\r\nthe articulations similarly vertical, but in both the form of the\r\narticulation is a circle. In Lizards the articular cup is usually rather\r\nwider than deep, when the cup and ball are developed in the vertebrae; it\r\ndiffers from the vertical condition in pterodactyles in being oblique\r\nand much narrower from side to side. Only among Crocodiles and Hatteria\r\nis there a double articulation for the cervical rib, though in neither\r\norder have rib or vertebra in the neck the bird-like proportions which\r\nare usual in these animals. Pterodactyles show no resemblance to birds\r\nin this vertebral articulation. A Bird has the corresponding surface\r\nconcave from side to side in front, but it is also convex from above\r\ndownward, producing what is known as the saddle-shaped form which is\r\npeculiarly avian, being found in existing birds except in part of the\r\nback in Penguins. It is faintly approximated to in one or two neck\r\nvertebrae in man. Professor Williston remarks that in the toothless\r\nPterodactyles of Kansas the hinder ball of the vertebral articulation is\r\ncontinued downward and outward as a concave articulation upon the\r\nprocesses at its outer corners. There are no mammals with a cup-and-ball\r\narticulation between the vertebrae, so that for what it is worth the\r\ncharacter now described in Ornithosaurs is reptilian, when judged by\r\ncomparison with existing animals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 25.  CERVICAL VERTEBRA OF ORNITHOCHEIRUS\r\n  From the Cambridge Greensand]\r\n\r\nLow down on each side of the vertebra, at the junction of its body with\r\nthe neural arch, is a large ovate foramen, transversely elongated, and\r\noften a little impressed at the border, which is the entrance of the\r\nair cell into the bone. These foramina are often one-third of the length\r\nof the neck vertebrae in specimens from the Cambridge Greensand, where\r\nthe neck bones vary from three-quarters of an inch to about two and a\r\nhalf inches in length, and in extreme forms are as wide as long. The\r\nwidth of the interspace between the foramina is one-half the width of\r\nthe vertebrae, though this character varies with different genera and\r\nspecies. Several species from the Solenhofen Slate have the neck long\r\nand slender, on the type of the Flamingo. In others the neck is thick\r\nand short--in the _Scaphognathus crassirostris_ and _Pterodactylus\r\nspectabilis_. Some genera with slender necks have the bones preserved\r\nwith a curved contour, such as might suggest a neck carried like that of\r\na Llama or a Camel. The neck is occasionally preserved in a curve like a\r\ncapital #S#, as though about to be darted forward like that of a bird in\r\nthe act of striking its prey. The genera of Pterodactyles with short\r\nnecks may have had as great mobility of neck as is found among birds\r\nnamed Ducks and Divers; but those Pterodactyles with stout necks, such\r\nas Dimorphodon and Ornithocheirus, in which the vertebrae are large,\r\nappear to have been built more for strength than activity, and the neck\r\nbones have been chiefly concerned in the muscular effort to use the\r\nfighting power of the jaws in the best way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BACK\r\n\r\nThe region of the back in a Pterodactyle is short as compared with the\r\nneck, and relatively is never longer than the corresponding region in a\r\nbird. The shortness results partly from the short length of the\r\nvertebrae, each of which is about as long as wide. There is also a\r\nmoderate number of bones in the back. In most skeletons from Solenhofen\r\nthese vertebrae between the neck and girdle of hip bones number from\r\ntwelve to sixteen. They have a general resemblance in form to the dorsal\r\nvertebrae in birds. The greatest number of such vertebrae in birds is\r\neleven. The number is small because some of the later vertebrae in birds\r\nare overlapped by the bones of the hip girdle, which extend forward and\r\ncover them at the sides, so that they become blended with the sacrum.\r\nThis region of the skeleton in the Dimorphodon from the Lias is\r\nremarkable for the length of the median process, named the neural spine,\r\nwhich is prolonged upward like the spines of the early dorsal vertebrae\r\nof Horses, Deer, and other mammals. In this character they differ from\r\nliving reptiles, and parallel some Dinosaurs from the Weald. The bones\r\nof the back in Ornithocheirus from the Cambridge Greensand show the\r\nunder side to be well rounded, so that the articular surfaces between\r\nthe vertebrae, though still rather wider than deep, are much less\r\ndepressed than in the region of the neck. The neural canal for the\r\nspinal cord has become larger and higher, and the sides of the bone are\r\nsomewhat compressed. Strong transverse processes for the support of the\r\nribs are elevated above the level of the neural canal, at the sides of\r\nvertebrae compressed on the under sides, and directed outward. Between\r\nthese lateral horizontal platforms is the compressed median neural\r\nspine, which varies in vertical height. The articulation of the ribs is\r\nnot seen clearly. Isolated ribs from the Stonesfield Slate have\r\ndouble-headed dorsal ribs, like those of birds. In some specimens from\r\nthe Solenhofen Slate like the Scaphognathus, in the University Museum at\r\nBonn, dorsal ribs appear to be attached by a notch in the transverse\r\nprocess of the dorsal vertebra, which resembles the condition in\r\nCrocodiles. Variations in the mode of attachment of ribs among mammals\r\nmay show that character to be of subordinate importance. Von Meyer has\r\ndescribed the first pair of ribs as frequently larger than the others,\r\nand there appear in Rhamphorhynchus to be examples preserved of the\r\nsternal ribs, which connect the dorsal ribs with the sternum. Six pairs\r\nhave been counted. A more interesting feature in the ribs consists in\r\nthe presence behind the sternum, which is shorter than the corresponding\r\nbone in most birds, of median sternal ribs. They are slender #V#-shaped\r\nbones in the middle line of the abdomen, which overlapped the ends of\r\nthe dorsal ribs like the similar sternal bones of reptiles. Such\r\nstructures are unknown among Birds and Mammals. There is no trace in the\r\ndorsal ribs of the claw-like process, which extends laterally from rib\r\nto rib as a marked feature in many birds. Its presence or absence may\r\nnot be important, because it is represented by fibro-cartilage in the\r\nribs of crocodiles, and may be a small cartilage near the head of the\r\nrib in serpents, and is only ossified in some ribs of the New Zealand\r\nreptile Hatteria. So that it might have been present in a fossil animal\r\nwithout being ossified and preserved. Although the structure is\r\nassociated with birds, it is possibly also represented by the great bony\r\nplates which cover the ribs in Chelonians, and combine to form the\r\nshield which covers the turtle's back. The structure is as\r\ncharacteristic of reptiles as of birds, but is not necessarily\r\nassociated with either.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 26\r\n\r\n  The upper figures show the side and back of a dorsal vertebra of\r\n  Ornithocheirus compared with corresponding views of the side and\r\n  back of a dorsal vertebra of a Crocodile]\r\n\r\nThere are two remarkable modifications of the early dorsal vertebrae in\r\nsome of the Cretaceous Pterodactyles. First, in the genus Ornithodesmus\r\nfrom the Weald the early dorsal vertebrae are blended together into a\r\ncontinuous mass, like that which is found in the corresponding region of\r\nthe living Frigate-bird, only more consolidated, and similar to that\r\nconsolidated structure found behind the dorsal vertebrae, known as the\r\nsacrum, made by the blending of the vertebrae into a solid mass which\r\nsupports the hip bones. Secondly, in some of the Cretaceous genera of\r\nPterodactyles of Europe and America the vertebrae in the front part of\r\nthe back are similarly blended, but their union is less complete; and in\r\ngenera Ornithocheirus and Ornithostoma--the former chiefly English, the\r\nlatter chiefly American--the sides of the neural spines are flattened to\r\nform an oval articular surface on each side, which gives attachment to\r\nthe flattened ends of their shoulder-blade bones named the scapulae. This\r\ncondition is found in no other animals. Three vertebrae appear to have\r\ntheir neural arches thus united together. The structure so formed may be\r\nnamed the notarium to distinguish it from the sacrum.\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRUM\r\n\r\nFor some mysterious reason the part of the backbone which lies between\r\nthe bones of the hips and supports them is termed the sacrum. Among\r\nliving reptiles the number of vertebrae in this region is usually two, as\r\nin lizards and crocodiles. There are other groups of fossil reptiles in\r\nwhich the number of sacral vertebrae is in some cases less and in other\r\ncases more. There is, perhaps, no group in which the sacrum makes a\r\nnearer approach to that of birds than is found among these\r\nPterodactyles, although there are more sacral vertebrae in some\r\nDinosaurs. In birds the sacral vertebrae number from five to twenty-two.\r\nIn bats the number is from five to six. In some Solenhofen species, such\r\nas _Pterodactylus dubius_ and _P. Kochi_ and _P. grandipelvis_, the\r\nnumber is usually five or six. The vertebrae are completely blended. The\r\npneumatic foramina in the sacrum, so far as they have been observed, are\r\non the under sides of the transverse processes; while in the\r\ncorresponding notarial structure in the shoulder girdle the foramina are\r\nin front of the transverse processes. Almost any placental mammal in\r\nwhich the vertebrae of the sacral region are anchylosed together has a\r\nsimilar sacrum, which differs from that of birds in the more complete\r\nindividuality of the constituent bones remaining evident. The transverse\r\nprocesses in front of the sacrum are wider than in its hinder part; so\r\nthat the pelvic bones which are attached to it converge as they extend\r\nbackward, as among mammals. The bodies of the vertebrae forming the\r\nsacrum are similar in length to those of the back. Each transverse\r\nprocess is given off opposite the body of its own vertebra, but from a\r\nlower lateral position than in the region of the back, in which the\r\nvertebrae are free.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 27.  SACRUM OF RHAMPHORHYNCHUS\r\n\r\n  Showing the complete blending of the vertebrae and ribs as in a bird,\r\n  with the well-defined Iliac bones, produced chiefly in front of the\r\n  acetabulum for the head of the femur.]\r\n\r\nThe hip bones are closely united with the sacrum by bony union, and\r\nrarely appear to come away from the sacral vertebrae, as among mammals\r\nand reptiles, though this happens with the Lias Pterodactyles. In the\r\nStonesfield Slate and Solenhofen Slate the slender transverse processes\r\nfrom the vertebrae blend with the ilium of the hip girdle, and form a\r\nseries of transverse foramina on each side of the bodies of the\r\nvertebrae. In the Cambridge Greensand genera the part of the ilium above\r\nthe acetabulum for the articular head of the femur appears to be always\r\nbroken away, so that the relation of the sacrum to the pelvis has not\r\nbeen observed. This character is no mark of affinity, but only shows\r\nthat ossification obliterated sutures among these animals in the same\r\nway as among birds.\r\n\r\nThe great difference between the sacrum of a Pterodactyle and that of a\r\nbird has been rendered intelligible by the excellent discussion of the\r\nsacral region in birds made by Professor Huxley. He showed that it is\r\nonly the middle part of the sacrum of a chicken which corresponds to the\r\ntrue sacrum of a reptile, and comprises the five shortest of the\r\nvertebrae; while the four in front correspond to those of the lower part\r\nof the back, which either bear no ribs or very short ribs, and are known\r\nas the lumbar region in mammals, so that the lower part of the back\r\nbecomes blended with the sacrum, and thus reduces the number of dorsal\r\nvertebrae. Similarly the five vertebrae which follow the true sacral\r\nvertebrae are originally part of the tail, and have been blended with the\r\nother vertebrae in front, in consequence of the extension along them of\r\nthe bird's hip bones. This interpretation helps to account for the great\r\nlength of the sacrum in many birds, and also explains in part the\r\nsingular shortness of the tail in existing birds. The Ornithosaur sacrum\r\nhas neither the lumbar nor the caudal portions of the sacrum of a bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TAIL\r\n\r\nThe tail is perhaps the least important part of the skeleton, since it\r\nvaries in character and length in different genera. The short tails seen\r\nin typical pterodactyles include as few as ten vertebrae in\r\n_Pterodactylus grandipelvis_ and _P. Kochi_, and as many as fifteen\r\nvertebrae in _Pterodactylus longirostris_. The tails are more like those\r\nof mammals than existing birds, in which there are usually from six to\r\nten vertebrae terminating in the ploughshare bone. But just as some\r\nfossil birds, like the Archaeopteryx, have about twenty long and slender\r\nvertebrae in the tail, so in the pterodactyle Rhamphorhynchus this region\r\nbecomes greatly extended, and includes from thirty-eight to forty\r\nvertebrae. In Dimorphodon the tail vertebrae are slightly fewer. The\r\nearliest are very short, and then they become elongated to two or three\r\ntimes the length of the early tail vertebrae, and finally shorten again\r\ntowards the extremity of the tail, where the bones are very slender. In\r\nall long-tailed Ornithosaurians the vertebrae are supported and bordered\r\nby slender ossified ligaments, which extend like threads down the tail,\r\njust as they do in Rats and many other mammals and in some lizards.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marsh was able to show that the extremity of the tail in\r\nRhamphorhynchus sometimes expands into a strong terminal caudal membrane\r\nof four-sided somewhat rhomboidal shape. He regards this membrane as\r\nhaving been placed vertically. It is supported by delicate processes\r\nwhich represent the neural spines of the vertebrae prolonged upward. They\r\nare about fifteen in number. A corresponding series of spines on the\r\nlower border, termed chevron bones, equally long, were given off from\r\nthe junctions of the vertebrae on their under sides, and produced\r\ndownward. This vertical appendage is of some interest because its\r\nexpansion is like the tail of a fish. It suggests the possibility of\r\nhaving been used in a similar way to the caudal fin as an organ for\r\nlocomotion in water, though it is possible that it may have also formed\r\nan organ used in flight for steering in the air.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 28.  EXTREMITY OF THE TAIL OF _RHAMPHORHYNCHUS\r\n  PHYLLURUS_ (MARSH)\r\n\r\n  Showing the processes on the upper and under sides of the vertebrae\r\n  which make the terminal leaf-like expansion]\r\n\r\nThe tail vertebrae from the Cambridge Greensand are mostly found isolated\r\nor with not more than four joints in association. They are very like the\r\nslender type of neck vertebrae seen in long-necked pterodactyles, but are\r\ndepressed, and though somewhat wider are not unlike the tail vertebrae of\r\nthe Rhamphorhynchus. The pneumatic foramen in them is a mere puncture.\r\nThey have no transverse processes or neural spines, nor indications of\r\nribs, or chevron bones.\r\n\r\nThe hindermost specimens of tail vertebrae observed have the neural arch\r\npreserved to the end, as among reptiles; whereas in mammals this arch\r\nbecomes lost towards the end of the tail. The processes by which the\r\nvertebrae are yoked together are small. There is nothing to suggest that\r\nthe tail was long, except the circumstance that the slender caudal\r\nvertebrae are almost as long as the stout cervical vertebrae in the same\r\nanimal. No small caudal vertebrae have ever been found in the Cambridge\r\nGreensand. The tail is very short, according to Professor Williston, in\r\nthe toothless Ornithostoma in the Chalk of Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE HIP-GIRDLE AND HIND LIMB\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bones of the hip-girdle form a basin which incloses and protects the\r\nabdominal vital organs. It consists on each side of a composite bone,\r\nthe unnamed bones--_ossa innominata_ of the older anatomists--which are\r\neach attached to the sacrum on their inner side, and on the outer side\r\ngive attachment to the hind limbs. As a rule three bones enter into the\r\nborders of this cup, termed the acetabulum, in which the head of the\r\nthigh bone, named the Femur, moves with a more or less rotary motion.\r\n\r\nThere are a few exceptions in this division of the cup between three\r\nbones, chiefly among Salamanders and certain Frogs. In Crocodiles the\r\nbone below the acetabular cup is not divided into two parts. And in\r\ncertain Plesiosaurs from the Oxford Clay--Muraenosaurus--the actual\r\narticulation appears to be made by two bones--the ilium and ischium. The\r\nthree bones which form each side of the pelvis are known as the ilium,\r\nor hip bone, sometimes termed the aitch bone; secondly, the ischium, or\r\nsitz bone, being the bone by which the body is supported in a sitting\r\nposition; and thirdly the pubis, which is the bone in front of the\r\nacetabulum. The pubic bones meet in the middle line of the body on the\r\nunder side of the pelvis in man, and on each side are partly separated\r\nfrom the ischia by a foramen, spoken of as the obturator foramen, which\r\nin Pterodactyles is minute and almost invisible, when it exists.\r\n\r\nThere is often a fourth bony element in the pelvis. In some Salamanders\r\na single cartilage is directed forward, and forked in front. According\r\nto Professor Huxley something of this kind is seen in the Dog. The pair\r\nof bones which extend forward in front of the pelvis in Crocodiles may\r\nbe of the same kind, in which case they should be called prepubic bones.\r\nBut among the lower mammals named marsupials a pouch is developed for\r\nthe protection of the young and supported by two slender bones attached\r\nto the pubes, and these bones have long been known as marsupial bones.\r\nIn a still lower group of mammalia named monotremata, which lay eggs,\r\nand in many ways approximate to reptiles and birds, stronger bones are\r\ndeveloped on the front edge of the pubes, and termed prepubic bones.\r\nThey do not support a marsupium.\r\n\r\nNaturalists have been uncertain as to the number of bones in the pelvis\r\nof Pterodactyles, because the bones blend together early in life, as in\r\nbirds. Some follow the Amphibian nomenclature, and unite the ischium and\r\npubis into one bone, which is then termed ischium, when the prepubis is\r\ntermed the pubis, and regarded as removed from the acetabulum. There is\r\nno ground for this interpretation, for the sutures are clear between the\r\nthree pelvic bones in the acetabulum in some specimens, like\r\n_Cycnorhamphus Fraasii_, from Solenhofen, and some examples of\r\nOrnithocheirus from the Cambridge Greensand. Pterodactyles all have\r\nprepubic bones, which are only known in Ornithorhynchus and Echidna\r\namong mammals, and are absent from the higher mammals and birds. They\r\nare unknown in any other existing animals, unless present in Crocodiles,\r\nin which ischium and pubis are always undivided. Therefore it is\r\ninteresting to examine the characters of the Ornithosaurian pelvis.\r\n\r\nThe acetabulum for the head of the femur is imperforate, being a simple\r\noval basin, as in Chelonian reptiles and the higher Mammals. It never\r\nshows the mark of the ligamentous attachment to the head of the femur,\r\nwhich is seen in Mammals. In Birds the acetabulum is perforated, as in\r\nmany of the fossils named Dinosaurs, and in Monotremata.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 29.  COMPARISON OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PELVIS IN\r\n  A BIRD AND A PTERODACTYLE]\r\n\r\nSecondly, the ilium is elongated, and extends quite as much in front of\r\nthe acetabulum as behind it. The bone is not very deep in this front\r\nprocess. Among existing animals this relation of the bone is nearer to\r\nbirds than to any other type, since birds alone have the ilium extended\r\nfrom the acetabulum in both directions. The form of the Pterodactyle\r\nilium is usually that of the embryo bird, and its slender processes\r\ncompare in relative length better with those of the unhatched fowl and\r\nApteryx of New Zealand than with the plate-like form in adult birds.\r\n\r\nIn mammals the ilium is directed forward, and even in the Cape ant-eater\r\nOrycteropus there is only an inappreciable production of the bone\r\nbackward behind the acetabulum. Among reptiles the general position of\r\nthe acetabulum is at the forward termination of the ilium, though the\r\nCrocodile has some extension of the bone in both directions, without\r\nforming distinct anterior and posterior processes. This anterior and\r\nposterior extension of the ilium is seen in the Theriodont reptiles of\r\nRussia and of South Africa, as well as in Dinosaurs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 30.  LEFT PELVIC BONES WITH PREPUBIC BONE IN\r\n  _PTERODACTYLUS LONGIROSTRIS_]\r\n\r\nThirdly, in all pterodactyles the ischium and pubis are more or less\r\ncompletely blended into a sheet of bone, unbroken by perforation, though\r\nthere is usually a minute vascular foramen; or the lower border may be\r\nnotched between the ischium and the pubis, as in some of the Solenhofen\r\nspecies, and the pubis does not reach the median line of the body. But\r\nin Dimorphodon the pelvic sheet of bone is unbroken by any notch or\r\nperforation. The notch between the ischium and pubis is well marked in\r\n_Pterodactylus longirostris_, and better marked in _Pterodactylus\r\ndubius_, _Cycnorhamphus Fraasii_, and Rhamphorhynchus. The fossil\r\nanimals which appear to come nearest to the Pterodactyles in the\r\nstructure of the pelvis are Theriodonts from the Permian rocks of\r\nRussia. The type known as Rhopalodon has the ilium less prolonged front\r\nand back, and is much deeper than in any Pterodactyle; but the\r\nacetabulum is imperforate, and the ischium and pubis are not always\r\ncompletely separated from each other by suture. In the pelvis referred\r\nto the Theriodont Deuterosaurus there is some approximation to the\r\npelvis of Rhamphorhynchus and of _Pterodactylus dubius_ in the depth of\r\nthe division between the pubis and ischium.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 31  PELVIS AND PREPUBIC BONES OF RHAMPHORHYNCHUS\r\n\r\n  On the left-hand side the two prepubic bones are separate. On the\r\n  right-hand they are united into a transverse bar which overlaps the\r\n  front of pelvis seen from the under side]\r\n\r\nThere are three modifications of the Ornithosaurian pelvis. First, the\r\ntype of Rhamphorhynchus, in which the pubis and ischium are inclined\r\nsomewhat backward, and in which the two prepubic bones are triangular,\r\nand are often united together to form a transverse bow in front of the\r\npubic region.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is the ordinary form of pelvis in which the pubis and\r\nischium usually unite with each other down their length, as in\r\nDimorphodon, but sometimes, as in _Pterodactylus dubius_, divide\r\nimmediately below the acetabulum. All these types possess the\r\npaddle-shaped prepubic bones, which are never united in the median line.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is the cretaceous form indicated by Ornithocheirus and\r\nOrnithostoma, in which the posterior half of the ilium is modified in a\r\nsingular way, since it is more elevated towards the sacrum than the\r\nanterior half, suggesting the contour of the upper border of the ilium\r\nin a lizard. Without being reptilian--the anterior prolongation of the\r\nbone makes that impossible--it suggests the lizards. This type also\r\npossesses prepubic bones. They appear, according to Professor Williston,\r\nto be more like the paddle-shaped bones of Pterodactylus than like the\r\nangular bones in Rhamphorhynchus. The prepubic bones are united in the\r\nmedian line as in Rhamphorhynchus. But their median union in that genus\r\nfavours the conclusion that the bones were united in the median line in\r\nall species, though they are only co-ossified in these two families.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 32.  THE PELVIC BONES OF AN ALLIGATOR SEEN FROM\r\n  BELOW\r\n\r\n  The bones in front are here regarded as prepubic, but are commonly\r\n  named pubic]\r\n\r\nThis median union of the prepubic bones is a difference from those\r\nmammals like the Ornithorhynchus and Echidna, which approach nearest to\r\nthe Reptilia. In them the prepubic bones have a long attachment to the\r\nfront margin of the pubis, and extend their points forward without any\r\ntendency for the anterior extremities to approximate or unite. The\r\nmarsupial mammals have the same character, keeping the marsupial bones\r\ncompletely distinct from each other at their free extremities. The only\r\nexisting animals in which an approximation is found to the prepubic\r\nbones in Pterodactyles are Crocodiles, in bones which most writers term\r\nthe pubic bones. This resemblance, without showing any strong affinity\r\nwith the Crocodilia, indicates that Crocodiles have more in common with\r\nthe fossil flying animals than any other group of existing reptiles; for\r\nother reptiles all want prepubic bones, or bones in front of the pubic\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HIND LIMB\r\n\r\nThe hind limb is exceptionally long in proportion to the back. This is\r\nconspicuous in the skeletons of the short-tailed Pterodactyles, and is\r\nalso seen in Dimorphodon. In Rhamphorhynchus the hind limb is relatively\r\nmuch shorter, so that the animal, when on all fours, may have had an\r\nappearance not unlike a Bat in similar position. The limb is\r\nexceptionally short in the little _Ptenodracon brevirostris_. The bones\r\nof the hind limb are exceptionally interesting. One remarkable feature\r\ncommon to all the specimens is the great elongation of the shin bones\r\nrelatively to the thigh bones. The femur is sometimes little more than\r\nhalf the length of the tibia, and always shorter than that bone. The\r\nproportions are those of mammals and birds. Some mammals have the leg\r\nshorter than the thigh, but mammals and birds alone, among existing\r\nanimals, have the proportions which characterise Pterodactyles. The\r\nfoot appears to have been applied to the ground not always as in a bird,\r\nbut more often in the manner of reptiles, or mammals in which the digits\r\nterminate in claws.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEMUR\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 33.  THE FEMUR\r\n\r\n  On the right is a front view of femur of a bear. In the middle are\r\n  front and side views of the femur of Ornithocheirus. On the left is\r\n  the femur of Echidna. These comparisons illustrate the mammalian\r\n  characters of the Pterodactyle thigh bone]\r\n\r\nThe thigh bone, on account of the small size of many of the specimens,\r\nis not always quite clear evidence as an indication of technical\r\nresemblance to other animals. The bone is always a little curved, has\r\nalways a rounded, articular head, and rounded distal condyles. Its most\r\nremarkable features are shown in the large, well-preserved specimens\r\nfrom the Cambridge Greensand. The rounded, articular head is associated\r\nwith a constricted neck to the bone, followed by a comparatively\r\nstraight shaft with distal condyles, less thickened than in mammals. No\r\nbird is known, much less any reptile, with a femur like Ornithocheirus.\r\nOnly among Mammals is a similar bone known with a distinct neck; and\r\nonly a few mammals have the exceptional characters of the rounded head\r\nand constricted neck at all similar to the Cretaceous Pterodactyles. A\r\nfew types, such as the higher apes, the Hyrax, and animals especially\r\nactive in the hind limb, have a femur at all resembling the Pterodactyle\r\nin the pit for the obturator externus muscle, behind the trochanter\r\nmajor, such as is seen in a small femur from Ashwell. The femur varies\r\nin different genera, so as to suggest a number of mammalia rather than\r\nany particular animal for comparison. These approximations may be\r\nconsequences of the ways in which the bones are used. When functional\r\nmodifications of the skeleton are developed, so as to produce similar\r\nforms of bones, the muscles to which they give attachment, which act\r\nupon the bones, and determine their growth, are substantially the same.\r\nIn the _Pterodactylus longirostris_ the femur corresponds in length to\r\nabout eleven dorsal vertebrae. The end next the shin bone is less\r\nexpanded than is usual among Mammals, and rather suggests an approach to\r\nthe condition in Crocodiles, in the moderate thickness and breadth of\r\nthe articular end, and the slight development of the terminal\r\npulley-joint. One striking feature of the femur is the circumstance that\r\nthe articular head, as compared with the distal end, is directed forward\r\nand very slightly inward and upward. So that allowing for the outward\r\ndivergence of the pelvic bones, as they extend forward, there must have\r\nbeen a tendency to a knock-kneed approximation of the lower ends of the\r\nthigh bones, as in Mammals and Birds, rather than the outward divergence\r\nseen in Reptiles.\r\n\r\nApparently the swing of the leg and foot, as it hung on the distal end\r\nof the femur, must have tended rather to an inward than to an outward\r\ndirection, so that the feet might be put down upon the same straight\r\nline; this arrangement suggests rapid movement.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 34.  COMPARISON OF THE TIBIA AND FIBULA IN\r\n  ORNITHOSAUR AND VULTURE]\r\n\r\n\r\nTIBIA AND FIBULA\r\n\r\nIn _Pterodactylus longirostris_ the tibia is slender, more than a fifth\r\nlonger than the femur. A crest is never developed at the proximal end,\r\nlike that seen in the Guillemot and Diver and other water birds. The\r\nbone is of comparatively uniform thickness down the shaft in most of the\r\nSolenhofen specimens, as in most birds. At the distal end the shin bone\r\ncommonly has a rounded, articular termination, like that seen in birds.\r\nThis is conspicuous in the _Pterodactylus grandis_. In other specimens\r\nthe tarsal bones, which form this pulley, remain distinct from the\r\ntibia; and the upper row of these bones appears to consist of two\r\nbones, like those which in many Dinosaurs combine to form the\r\npulley-like end of the tibia which represents the bird's drum-stick\r\nbone. They correspond with the ankle bones in man named astragalus and\r\nos calcis.\r\n\r\nComplete English specimens of tibia and fibula are found in the genus\r\nDimorphodon from the Lias, in which the terminal pulley of the distal\r\nend has some expansion, and is placed forward towards the front of the\r\ntibia, as in some birds. The rounded surface of the pulley is rather\r\nbetter marked than in birds. The proximal end of the shaft is relatively\r\nstout, and is modified by the well-developed fibula, which is a short\r\nexternal splint bone limited to the upper half of the tibia, as in\r\nbirds; but contributing with it to form the articular surface for the\r\nsupport of the lower end of the femur, taking a larger share in that\r\nwork than in birds. Frequently there is no trace of the fibula visible\r\nin Solenhofen specimens as preserved; or it is extremely slender and\r\nbird-like, as in _Pterodactylus longirostris_. In Rhamphorhynchus it\r\nappears to extend the entire length of the tibia, as in Dinosaurs. In\r\nthe specimens from the Cambridge Greensand there is indication of a\r\nsmall proximal crest to the tibia with a slight ridge, but no evidence\r\nthat this is due to a separate ossification. The patella, or knee-cap,\r\nis not recognised in any fossil of the group. There is no indication of\r\na fibula in the specimens thus far known from the Chalk rocks either of\r\nKansas in America, or in England.\r\n\r\nThe region of the tarsus varies from the circumstance that in many\r\nspecimens the tibia terminates downward in a rounded pulley, like the\r\ndrum-stick of a bird; while in other specimens this union of the\r\nproximal row of the tarsal bones with the tibia does not take place, and\r\nthen there are two rows of separate tarsal bones, usually with two bones\r\nin each row. When the upper row is united with the tibia the lower row\r\nremains distinct from the metatarsus, though no one has examined these\r\nseparate tarsal bones so as to define them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOOT\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 35.  METATARSUS AND DIGITS IN THREE TYPES OF\r\n  ORNITHOSAURS]\r\n\r\nThe foot sometimes has four toes, and sometimes five. There are four\r\nsomewhat elongated, slender metatarsal bones, which are separate from\r\neach other and never blended together, as in birds. There has been a\r\nsuspicion that the metatarsal bones were separate in the young\r\nArchaeopteryx. In the young of many birds the row of tarsal bones at the\r\nproximal end of the metatarsus comes away, and there is a partial\r\ndivision between the metatarsal bones, though they remain united in the\r\nmiddle. And among Penguins, in which the foot bones are applied to the\r\nground instead of being carried in the erect position of ordinary birds,\r\nthere is always a partial separation between the metatarsal bones,\r\nthough they become blended together. The Pterodactyle is therefore\r\ndifferent from birds in preserving the bones distinct through life, and\r\nthis character is more like Reptiles than Mammals. The individual bones\r\nare not like those of Dinosaurs, and diverge in Rhamphorhynchus as\r\nthough the animals were web-footed. There is commonly a rudimentary\r\nfifth metatarsal. It is sometimes only a claw-shaped appendage, like\r\nthat seen in the Crocodile. It is sometimes a short bone, completely\r\nformed, and carrying two phalanges in Solenhofen specimens: though no\r\ntrace of these phalanges is seen in the large toothless Pterodactyles\r\nfrom the Cretaceous rocks of North America. In the _Pterodactylus\r\nlongirostris_ the number of foot bones on the ordinary digits is two,\r\nthree, four, five, as in lizards; but the short fifth metatarsal has\r\nonly two toe bones. In Dimorphodon the fifth digit was bent upward, and\r\nsupported a membrane for flight. There are slight variations in the\r\nnumber of foot bones. In the species _Pterodactylus scolopaciceps_ the\r\nnumber of bones in the toes follows the formula two, three, three, four.\r\nIn _Pterodactylus micronyx_ the number is two, three, three, three. The\r\nterminal claws are much less developed than is usual with Birds; and\r\nthere is a difference from Bats in the unequal length of the digits.\r\nTaken as a whole, the foot is perhaps more reptilian than avian, and in\r\nsome genera is crocodilian.\r\n\r\nThe foot is the light foot of an active animal. Von Meyer thought that\r\nthe hind legs were too slender to enable the animal to walk on land; and\r\nProfessor Williston, of the University of Kansas, remarks that the\r\nrudimentary claws and weak toes indicate that the animal could not have\r\nused the feet effectively for grasping, while the exceedingly free\r\nmovement of the femur indicates great freedom of movement of the hind\r\nlegs; and he concludes that the function of the legs was chiefly for\r\nguidance in flight through their control over the movements, and\r\nexpresses his belief that the animal could not have stood upon the\r\nground with its feet. There may be evidence to sustain other views. If\r\nthe limb bones are reconstructed, they form limbs not wanting in\r\nelegance or length. If it is true, as Professor Williston suggests, that\r\nthe weight of his largest animals with the head three feet long, and a\r\nstretch of wing of eighteen or nineteen feet, did not exceed twenty\r\npounds, there can be no objection to regarding these animals as\r\nquadrupeds, or even as bipeds, on the ground of the limbs lacking the\r\nstrength necessary to support the body. The slender toes of many birds,\r\nand even the two toes of the ostrich, may be thought to give less\r\nadequate support for those animals than the metatarsals and digits of\r\nPterodactyles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSHOULDER-GIRDLE AND FORE LIMB\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERNUM\r\n\r\nThe sternum is always a distinguishing part of the bony structure of the\r\nbreast. In Crocodiles it is a cartilage to which the sternal ribs unite;\r\nand upon its front portion a flat knife-like bone called the\r\ninterclavicle is placed. In lizards like the Chameleon, it is a\r\nlozenge-shaped structure of thin bony texture, also bearing a long\r\ninterclavicle, which supports the clavicular bones, named collar bones\r\nin man, which extend outward to the shoulder blades. Among mammals the\r\nsternum is usually narrow and flat, and often consists of many\r\nsuccessive pieces in the middle line, on the under side of the body.\r\nAmong Bats the anterior part is somewhat widened from side to side, to\r\ngive attachment to the collar bones, but the sternum still remains a\r\nnarrow bone, much narrower than in Dolphins, and not differing in\r\ncharacter from many other Mammals, notwithstanding the Bat's power of\r\nflight. The bone develops a median keel for the attachment of the\r\nmuscles of the breast, but something similar is seen in burrowing\r\nInsectivorous mammals like the Moles. So that, as Von Meyer remarked,\r\nthe presence of a keel on the sternum is not in itself sufficient\r\nevidence to prove flight.\r\n\r\nAmong birds the sternum is greatly developed. Broad and short in the\r\nOstrich tribe, it is devoid of a keel; and therefore the keel, if\r\npresent in a bird, is suggestive of flight. The keel is differently\r\ndeveloped according to the mode of attachment of the several pectoral\r\nmuscles which cover a bird's breast. In several water birds the keel is\r\nstrongly developed in front, and dies away towards the hinder part of\r\nthe sternum, as in the Cormorant and its allies. The sternum in German\r\nPterodactyles is most nearly comparable to these birds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 36.  COMPARISON OF THE STERNUM]\r\n\r\nIn the Solenhofen Slate the sternum is fairly well preserved in many\r\nOrnithosaurs. It is relatively shorter than in birds, and is broader\r\nthan long; but not very like the sternum of reptile or mammal in form.\r\nThe keel is limited to the anterior part of the shield of the sternum,\r\nas in Merganser and the Cormorant, and is prolonged forward for some\r\ndistance in advance of it. Von Meyer noticed the resemblance of this\r\nanterior process to the interclavicle of the Crocodile in position; but\r\nit is more like the keel of a bird's sternum, and is not a separate bone\r\nas in Reptiles. In Pterodactyles from the Cretaceous rocks, the side\r\nbones, called coracoids, are articulated to saddle-shaped surfaces at\r\nthe hinder part of the base of this keel, which are parallel in\r\nOrnithocheirus, as in most birds, but overlap in Ornithodesmus, as in\r\nHerons and wading birds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 37.  STERNUM IN ORNITHOCHEIRUS FROM THE CAMBRIDGE\r\n  GREENSAND\r\n\r\n  Showing the strong keel and the facets for the coracoid bones on its\r\n  hinder border above the lateral constrictions]\r\n\r\nThe keel was pneumatic, and when broken is seen to be hollow, and\r\nappears to have been exceptionally high in Rhamphorhynchus, a genus in\r\nwhich the wing bones are greatly elongated. Von Meyer found in\r\nRhamphorhynchus on each side of the sternum a separate lateral plate\r\nwith six pairs of sternal ribs, which unite the sternum with the dorsal\r\nribs, as in the young of some birds. The hinder surface of the sternum\r\nis imperfectly preserved in the toothless Pterodactyles of Kansas.\r\nProfessor Williston states that the bone is extremely thin and\r\npentagonal in outline, projecting in front of the coracoids, in a stout,\r\nblunt, keel-like process, similar to that seen in the Pterodactyles of\r\nthe Cambridge Greensand. American specimens have not the same notch\r\nbehind the articulation for the coracoid to separate it from the\r\ntransverse lateral expansion of the sternal shield. The lateral margin\r\nin the Cambridge Greensand specimens figured by Professor Owen and\r\nmyself is broken; but Professor Williston had the good fortune to find\r\non the margin of the sternum the articular surfaces which gave\r\nattachment to the sternal ribs. The margin of the sternal bone thickens\r\nat these facets, four of which are preserved. The sternum in\r\nOrnithostoma was about four and a half inches long by less than five and\r\na half inches wide. The median keel extends forward for rather less than\r\ntwo inches, while in the smaller Cambridge species of Ornithocheirus it\r\nextends forward for less than an inch and a half.\r\n\r\nA sternum of this kind is unlike that of any other animal, but has most\r\nin common with a bird; and may be regarded as indicating considerable\r\npower of flight. The bone cannot be entirely attributed to the effect of\r\nflight, since there is no such expanded sternal shield in Bats. The\r\nsmall number of sternal ribs is even more characteristic of birds than\r\nmammals or reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHOULDER-GIRDLE\r\n\r\nThe bones which support the fore limb are one of the distinctive regions\r\nof the skeleton defining the animal's place in nature. Among most of the\r\nlower vertebrata, such as Amphibians and Reptiles, the girdle is a\r\ndouble arch--the arch of the collar bone or clavicles in front, and the\r\narch of the shoulder-blade or scapula behind. The clavicular arch, when\r\nit exists, is formed of three or five parts--a medium bar named the\r\ninterclavicle, external to which is a pair of bones called clavicles,\r\nreaching to the front of the scapulae when they are present; and\r\noccasionally there is a second pair of bones called supraclavicles,\r\nextending from the clavicles up the front margins of the scapulae. Thus\r\nthe clavicular arch is placed in front of the scapular arch. The\r\nsupraclavicles are absent from all living Reptiles, and the clavicles\r\nare absent from Crocodiles. The interclavicle is absent from all mammals\r\nexcept Echidna and Ornithorhynchus. Clavicles also may be absent in some\r\norders of mammals. Hence the clavicular arch may be lost, though the\r\ncollar bones are retained in man.\r\n\r\nThe scapular arch also is more complicated and more important in the\r\nlower than in the higher vertebrata. It may include three bones on each\r\nside named coracoid, precoracoid, and scapula. But in most vertebrates\r\nthe coracoid and precoracoid appear never to have been segmented so as\r\nto be separated from each other; and it is only among extinct types of\r\nreptiles, which appear to approximate to the Monotreme mammals, that\r\nseparate precoracoid bones are found; though among most mammals,\r\nprobably, there are stages of early development in which precoracoids\r\nare represented by small cartilages, though few mammals except Edentata\r\nlike the Sloths and Ant-eaters, retain even the coracoids as distinct\r\nbones. Therefore, excepting the Edentata and the Monotremes, the\r\ndistinctive feature of the mammalian shoulder-girdle appears to be that\r\nthe limbs are supported by the shoulder-blades, termed the scapulae.\r\n\r\nAmong reptiles there are several distinct types of shoulder-girdle.\r\nChelonians possess a pair of bones termed coracoids which have no\r\nconnexion with a sternum; and their scapulae are formed of two widely\r\ndivergent bars, divided by a deeper notch than is found in any fossil\r\nreptiles. Among Lizards both scapula and coracoid are widely expanded,\r\nand the coracoid is always attached to the sternum. Chameleons have the\r\nblade of the scapula long and slender, but the coracoid is always as\r\nbroad as it is long. Crocodiles have the bone more elongated, so that it\r\nhas somewhat the aspect of a very strong first sternal rib when seen on\r\nthe ventral face of the animal. The bone is perforated by a foramen,\r\nwhich would probably lie in the line of separation from the precoracoid\r\nif any such separation had ever taken place. The scapula, or\r\nshoulder-blade, of Crocodiles is a similar flat bone, very much shorter\r\nthan the scapula of a Chameleon, and more like that of the New Zealand\r\nHatteria. Thus there is very little in common between the several\r\nreptilian types of shoulder-girdle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 38.  COMPARISON OF SCAPULA AND CORACOID IN THREE\r\n  PTERODACTYLES AND A BIRD]\r\n\r\nIn birds the apparatus for the support of the wings has a far-off\r\nresemblance to the Crocodilian type. The coracoid bones, instead of\r\nbeing directed laterally outward and upward from the sternum, as among\r\nCrocodiles, are directed forward, so as to prolong the line of the\r\nbreast bone, named the sternum. The bird's coracoid is sometimes\r\nflattened towards the breast bone among Swans and other birds; yet as a\r\nrule the coracoid is a slender bar, which combines with the still more\r\nslender and delicate blade of the scapula, which rests on the ribs, to\r\nmake the articulation for the upper arm bone. Among reptiles the scapula\r\nand coracoid are more or less in the same straight line, as in the\r\nOstrich, but in birds of flight they meet at an angle which is less than\r\na right angle, and where they come in contact the external surface is\r\nthickened and excavated to make the articulation for the head of the\r\nhumerus. There is nothing like this shoulder-girdle outside the class of\r\nbirds, until it is compared with the corresponding structure in these\r\nextinct animals called Pterodactyles. The resemblance between the two is\r\nsurprising. It is not merely the identity of form in the coracoid bone\r\nand the scapula, but the similar angle at which they meet and the\r\nsimilar position of the articulation for the humerus. Everything in the\r\nPterodactyle's shoulder-girdle is bird-like, except the absence of the\r\nrepresentative of the clavicles, that forked #V#-shaped bone of the bird\r\nwhich in scientific language is known as the furculum, and is popularly\r\ntermed the \"merry-thought.\" This kind of shoulder-girdle is found in the\r\ngenera from the Lias and the Oolitic rocks, both of this country and\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIn the Cretaceous rocks the scapula presents, in most cases, a different\r\nappearance. The coracoid is an elongated, somewhat triangular bone,\r\ncompressed on the outer margin as in birds, but differing alike from\r\nbirds and other Pterodactyles in not being prolonged forward beyond the\r\narticulation for the humerus. In these Cretaceous genera, toothed and\r\ntoothless alike, the articulation for the upper arm bone truncates the\r\nextremity of the coracoid, so that the bone is less like that of a bird\r\nin this feature. Perhaps it shows a modification towards the crocodilian\r\ndirection. The scapula, which unites with the coracoid at about a right\r\nangle, is similarly truncated by the articular surface for the humerus;\r\nbut the bone is somewhat expanded immediately beyond the articulation,\r\nand compressed; and instead of being directed backward, it is directed\r\ninward over the ribs to articulate with the neural arches of the early\r\ndorsal vertebrae in the genera found in strata associated with the Chalk.\r\nAs the bone approaches this articulation, it thickens and widens a\r\nlittle, becoming suddenly truncated by an ovate facet, which exactly\r\ncorresponds to the transversely ovate impression, concave from front to\r\nback, which is seen in the neural arches of the dorsal vertebrae on which\r\nit fits. This condition is not present in all Cretaceous Pterodactyles.\r\nIt does not occur in the Kansas fossil, named by Professor Marsh,\r\nNyctodactylus. And it appears to be absent from the Pterodactyles of the\r\nEnglish Weald, named Ornithodesmus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 39.  THE NOTARIUM\r\n\r\n  An ossification which gives attachment to the scapulae seen in the\r\n  early dorsal vertebra of Ornithocheirus\r\n\r\n  (From the Cambridge Greensand)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 40.  RESTORATION OF THE SHOULDER-GIRDLE IN THE\r\n  CRETACEOUS ORNITHOCHEIRUS\r\n\r\n  Showing how the scapulae articulate with a vertebra and the\r\n  articulation of the coracoids with the sternum. The humeral\r\n  articulation with the coracoid is unlike the condition shown\r\n  in other Ornithosaurs]\r\n\r\nThere is no approach to this transverse position of the scapulae among\r\nbirds. And while the form of the bones in the older genera of\r\nOrnithosaurs is singularly bird-like, the angular arrangement in this\r\nCretaceous genus is obtained by closely approximating the articulations\r\non the sternum, so that the coracoids extend outward as in reptiles,\r\ninstead of forward as in birds; and the extremities of the scapulae\r\nsimilarly approximate towards each other. This rather recalls the\r\nrelative positions of scapula and coracoid among crocodiles. If\r\ncrocodile and bird had been primitive types of animals instead of\r\nsurviving types, it might almost seem as though there had been a cunning\r\nand harmonious blending of one with the other in evolving this form of\r\nshoulder-girdle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORE LIMB\r\n\r\nThe bones of the fore limb, generally, correspond in length with the\r\nsimilar parts of the hind limb. The upper arm bone corresponds with the\r\nupper leg bone, and the fore-arm bone is as long as the fore-leg bone;\r\nthen differences begin. The bones which correspond to the back of the\r\nhand in man, termed the metacarpus, are variable in length in\r\nPterodactyles--sometimes very long and sometimes short. The wing\r\nmetacarpal bone is always stout, and the others are slender. The\r\nextremity of the metacarpus was applied to the ground. Three small\r\ndigits of the hand are developed from the three small metacarpal bones,\r\nand terminate in large claws.\r\n\r\nThe great wing finger was bent backward, and only touched the ground\r\nwhere it fitted upon the wing metacarpal bone. It appears sometimes to\r\nhave been as long as the entire vertebral column.\r\n\r\nOwing to the circumstance that the joint in the arm in Pterodactyles was\r\nnot at the wrist as among birds, but between the metacarpus and the\r\nphalanges, it follows that the fore limb was longer than the hind limb\r\nwhen the metacarpus was long; but the difference would not interfere\r\nwith the movements of the animal, either upon four feet or on two feet,\r\nfor in bats and birds the disproportion in length is greater.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMERUS OR UPPER ARM BONE\r\n\r\nThe first bone in the fore-arm, the humerus, is remarkable chiefly for\r\nthe compressed crescent form of its upper articular end, which is never\r\nrounded like the head of the upper arm bone in man, and secondly for the\r\ngreat development of the external process of bone near that end, termed\r\nthe radial crest. Sir Richard Owen compared the bone to the humerus of\r\nboth birds and crocodiles, but in its upper articular end the crocodile\r\nbone may be said to be more like a bird than it is like the\r\nPterodactyle. In flying reptiles the articular surface next to the\r\nshoulder-girdle is somewhat saddle-shaped, being concave from side to\r\nside above and convex vertically, while most animals with which it can\r\nbe compared have the articular head of the bone convex in both\r\ndirections. A remarkable exception to this general rule is found in some\r\nfossil animals from South Africa, which, from resemblance to mammals in\r\ntheir teeth, have been termed Theriodonts. They sometimes have the head\r\nof the bone concave from side to side and convex in the vertical\r\ndirection. To this condition Ornithorhynchus makes a slight\r\napproximation. The singular expansion of the structure called the radial\r\ncrest finds no close parallel in reptiles, though Crocodiles have a\r\nmoderate crest on the humerus in the same position; and in Theriodonts\r\nthe radial crest extends much further down the shaft of the humerus. No\r\nbird has a radial crest of a similar kind, though it is prolonged some\r\nway down the shaft in Archaeopteryx. In Pterodactyles it sometimes\r\nterminates outward in a smooth, rounded surface, which might have been\r\narticular if any structure could have articulated with it. There is also\r\na moderate expansion of the bone on the ulnar side in some\r\nPterodactyles, so that the proximal end often incloses nearly\r\nthree-fourths of an ovate outline. The termination of the radial crest\r\nis at the opposite end of this oval to the wider articular part of the\r\nhead of the bone, in some specimens from the Cambridge Greensand. The\r\nradial crest is more extended in Rhamphorhynchus. All specimens of the\r\nhumerus show a twist in the length of the bone, so that the end towards\r\nthe fore-arm, which is wider than the shaft, makes a right angle with\r\nthe radial crest on the proximal end, which is not seen in birds. The\r\nshaft of the humerus is always stouter than that of the femur, though\r\ndifferent genera differ in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe humerus in genera from rocks associated with the Chalk presents two\r\nmodifications, chiefly seen in the characters of the distal end of the\r\nbone. One of these is a stout bone with a curiously truncated end where\r\nit joins the two bones of the fore-arm; and the other is more or less\r\nremarkable for the rounded form of the distal condyles. Both types show\r\ndistinct articular surfaces. The inner one is somewhat oblique and\r\nconcave, the outer one rounded; the two being separated by a concave\r\nchannel, so that the ulna makes an oblique articulation with the bone as\r\nin birds, and the radius articulates by a more or less truncated or\r\nconcave surface.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 41.  COMPARISON OF THE HUMERUS IN PTERODACTYLE AND\r\n  BIRD]\r\n\r\n\r\nULNA AND RADIUS\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 42.  COMPARISON OF THE BONES OF THE FORE-ARM IN\r\n  BIRD AND ORNITHOSAUR]\r\n\r\nThe bones of the fore-arm are similar to each other in size, and if\r\nthere be any difference between them the ulna is slightly the larger.\r\nThere is some evidence that in Rhamphorhynchus the upper end of the ulna\r\nwas placed behind the radius, probably in consequence of the mode of\r\nattachment of those bones to the humerus. The ulna abutted towards the\r\ninner and lower border, while the radius was towards the upper border,\r\nconsequent upon the twist in the humerus. This condition corresponds\r\nsubstantially with the arrangement in birds, but differs from birds in\r\nthe relatively more important part taken by the radius in making the\r\narticulation. The bones are compared in Dimorphodon with the Golden\r\nEagle drawn of the same size (Fig. 42). In birds the ulna supports the\r\ngreat feathers of the wing, and this may account for the size of the\r\nbone. The ulna is best seen at its proximal end in the specimens from\r\nthe Cambridge Greensand, where there is a terminal olecranon\r\nossification forming an oblique articulation, which frequently comes\r\naway and is lost. It is sometimes well preserved, and indicated by a\r\nsuture. The examples of ulna from the Lias show a slight expansion of\r\nthe bone at both ends, and at the distal end toward the wrist the\r\narticulation is well defined, where the bone joins the carpus. The\r\nlarger specimens of the bone are broken. The distal articular surface is\r\nonly connected with the proximal end of the bone in small specimens: it\r\nalways shows on the one margin a concavity, followed by a prominent\r\nboss, and an oblique articulation beyond the boss. On the side towards\r\nthe radius, on the lower end of the shaft there is an angular ridge,\r\nwhich marks the line along which the ulna overlaps the radius. The\r\nlower end of the radius has a simple, slightly convex articulation,\r\nsomewhat bean-shaped. No rotation of these bones on each other was\r\npossible as in man. There is a third bone in the fore-arm. This bone,\r\nnamed the pteroid, is commonly seen in skeletons from Solenhofen. It was\r\nregarded by Von Meyer as having supported the wing membrane in flight.\r\nSome writers have interpreted it as an essential part of the\r\nPterodactyle skeleton, and Von Meyer thought that it might possibly\r\nindicate a fifth digit in the hand. The only existing structure at all\r\nlike it is seen in the South African insectivorous mammal named\r\n_Chrysochloris capensis_, the golden mole, which also has three bones in\r\nthe fore-arm, the third bone extending half-way up towards the humerus.\r\nIn that animal the third bone appears to be behind the others and\r\nadjacent to the ulna. In the German fossils the pteroid articulated with\r\na separate carpal or metacarpal bone, placed on the side of the arm\r\nadjacent to the radius, and the radius is always more inward than the\r\nulna. If the view suggested by Von Meyer is adopted, this bone would be\r\na first digit extending outward and backward towards the humerus. That\r\nview was adopted by Professor Marsh. It involves the interpretation of\r\nwhat has been termed the lateral carpal as the first metacarpal bone,\r\nwhich would be as short as that of a bird, but turned in the opposite\r\ndirection backward. The first digit would then only carry one phalange,\r\nand would not terminate in a claw, but lie in the line of the tendon\r\nwhich supports the anterior wing membrane of a bird.\r\n\r\nThe third bone in the fore-arm of Chrysochloris does not appear to\r\ncorrespond to a digit. The bone is on the opposite side of the arm to\r\nthe similar bone of a Pterodactyle, and therefore cannot be the same\r\nstructure in the Golden Mole. The interpretation which makes the pteroid\r\nbone the first digit has the merit of accounting for the fifth digit of\r\nthe hand. All the structures of the hand are consistent with this view.\r\nThe circumstance that the bone is rarely found in contact with the\r\nradius, but diverging from it, shows that it plays the same part in\r\nstretching the membrane in advance of the arm, that the fifth digit\r\nholds in supporting the larger wing membrane behind the arm.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Williston, the American toothless Pterodactyle\r\nOrnithostoma has but a single phalange on the corresponding first toe of\r\nthe hind foot, and that bone he describes as long, cylindrical, gently\r\ncurved, and bluntly pointed. There is some support for this\r\ninterpretation; but I have not seen any English or German Pterodactyles\r\nwith only one phalange in the first toe.\r\n\r\nThe wing in Pterodactyles would thus be stretched between two fingers\r\nwhich are bent backward, the three intermediate digits terminating in\r\nclaws.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARPUS\r\n\r\nThe wrist bones in the reptilia usually consist of two rows. In\r\nCrocodiles, in the upper row there is a large inner and a small outer\r\nbone, behind which is a lunate bone, the remainder of the carpus being\r\ncartilaginous. Only one carpal is converted into bone in the lower row.\r\nIt is placed immediately under the smaller upper carpal. In Chelonians,\r\nthe turtle and tortoise group, the characters of the carpus vary with\r\nthe family. In the upper row there are usually two short carpals, which\r\nmay be blended, under the ulna; while the two under the radius are\r\ncommonly united. The lower row is made up of several small bones.\r\nLizards, too, usually have three bones in the proximal row and five\r\nsmaller bones in the distal row.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of the distal carpals with the several metacarpal\r\nbones of the middle hand is a well-known feature of the structure of the\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\nVon Meyer remarks that the carpus is made up of two rows of small bones\r\nin the Solenhofen Pterodactyles; while in birds there is one row\r\nconsisting of two bones. The structure of the carpus is not distinct in\r\nall German specimens; but in the short-tailed Solenhofen genera the\r\nbones in the two rows retain their individuality.\r\n\r\nIn all the Cretaceous genera the carpal bones of each row are blended\r\ninto a single bone, so that two bones are superimposed, which may be\r\ntermed the proximal and distal carpals. One specimen shows by an\r\nindication of sutures the original division of the distal carpal into\r\nthree bones; and the separated constituent bones are very rarely met\r\nwith. Two bones of the three confluent elements contribute to the\r\nsupport of the wing metacarpal, and the third gives an articular\r\nattachment to the bone which extends laterally at the inner side of the\r\ncarpus, which I now think may be the first metacarpal bone turned\r\nbackward towards the humerus. The three component bones meet in the\r\ncircular pneumatic foramen in the middle of the under side of the distal\r\ncarpal. There is no indication of division of the proximal carpal in\r\nthese genera into constituent bones.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:  FIG. 43.  CARPUS FROM ORNITHOCHEIRUS\r\n  (Cambridge Greensand)]\r\n\r\nThis condition is somewhat different from birds. In 1873 Dr. Rosenberg,\r\nof Dorpat, showed that there is in the bird a proximal carpal formed of\r\ntwo elements, and a distal carpal also formed of two elements. Therefore\r\nthe two constituents of the distal carpal in the bird which blends in\r\nthe mature animal with the metacarpus, forming the rounded pulley joint,\r\nmay correspond with two of the three bones in the Cretaceous\r\nPterodactyle _Ornithocheirus._\r\n\r\nThe width of a proximal carpal rarely exceeds two inches, and that of a\r\ndistal carpal is about an inch and three-quarters. Two such bones when\r\nin contact would not measure more than one inch in depth. The lower\r\nsurface shows that the wing had some rotary movement upon the carpus\r\noutward and backward.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETACARPUS\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 44.  METACARPUS IN TWO ORNITHOSAURS]\r\n\r\nThe metacarpus consists of bones which correspond to the back of the\r\nhand. The first digit of the hand in clawed animals has the metacarpal\r\nbone short, or shorter than the others. Among mammals metacarpal bones\r\nare sometimes greatly elongated; and a similar condition is found in\r\nPterodactyles, in which the metacarpal bone may be much longer than the\r\nphalange which is attached to it. Two metacarpal bones appear to be\r\nsingularly stouter than the others. The first bone of the first digit,\r\nif rightly determined, is much shorter than the others, and is, in fact,\r\nno longer than the carpus (Fig. 43). It is a flat oblong bone, attached\r\nto the inner side of the lower carpal, and instead of being prolonged\r\ndistally in the same direction as the other metacarpal bones, is turned\r\nround and directed upward, so that its upper edge is flush with the base\r\nof the radius, and gives attachment to a bone which resembles a terminal\r\nphalange of the wing finger. According to this interpretation it is the\r\nfirst and only phalange in the first digit. The bone is often about half\r\nas long as the fore-arm, terminates upward in a point, is sometimes\r\ncurved, and frequently diverges outward from the bones of the fore-arm,\r\nas preserved in the associated skeleton, being stretched towards the\r\nradial crest of the humerus. This mode of attachment of the supposed\r\nfirst metacarpal, which is true for all Cretaceous pterodactyles, has\r\nnot been shown to be the same for all those from the Solenhofen Slate.\r\nThere is no greater anomaly in this metacarpal and phalange on the\r\ninner side being bent backward, than there is in the wing finger being\r\nbent backward on the outer side. The three slender intervening digits\r\nextend forward between them, as though they were applied to the ground\r\nfor walking.\r\n\r\nThe bone which is usually known as the wing metacarpal is frequently\r\nstouter at the proximal end towards the carpus than towards the\r\nphalange. At the carpal end it is oblong and truncated, with a short\r\nmiddle process, which may have extended into the pit in the base of the\r\ncarpal bone; while the distal terminal end is rounded exactly like a\r\npulley. There is great difference in the length of the metacarpus. In\r\nthe American genus Ornithostoma it is much longer than the fore-arm. In\r\nRhamphorhynchus it is remarkably short, though perhaps scarcely so short\r\nas in Dimorphodon or in Scaphognathus. The largest Cretaceous examples\r\nare about two inches wide where they join the carpus. The bone is\r\nsometimes a little curved.\r\n\r\nBetween the first and fifth or wing metacarpal are the three slender\r\nmetacarpal bones which give attachment to the clawed digits. They bear\r\nmuch the same relation to the wing metacarpal that the large metatarsal\r\nof a Kangaroo has to the slender bones of the instep which are parallel\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThe facet for the wing metacarpal on the carpus is clearly recognised,\r\nbut as a rule there is no surface with which the small metacarpals can\r\nbe separately articulated. One or two exceptional specimens from the\r\nCambridge Greensand appear to have not only surfaces for the wing\r\nmetacarpal, but two much smaller articular surfaces, giving attachment\r\nto smaller metacarpals; while in one case there appears to be only one\r\nof these additional impressions. It is certain that all the animals from\r\nthe Lias and Oolites have three clawed digits, but at present I have\r\nseen no evidence that there were three in the Cretaceous genera, though\r\nProfessor Williston's statements and restoration appear to show that the\r\ntoothless Pterodactyles have three. Another difference from the Oolitic\r\ntypes, according to Professor Williston, is in the length of the slender\r\nmetacarpals of the clawed phalanges being about one-third that of the\r\nwing metacarpal, but this is probably due to imperfect ossification at\r\nthe proximal end; for at the distal end the bones all terminated on the\r\nsame level, showing that the four outer digits were applied to the\r\nground to support the weight of the body. The corresponding bone in the\r\nHorse and Oxen is carried erect, so as to be in a vertical line with the\r\nbones of the fore-arm; and the same position prevails usually, though\r\nnot invariably, with the corresponding bone in the hind limb, while in\r\nmany clawed mammals the metacarpus and metatarsus are both applied upon\r\nthe ground. In Pterodactyles the metatarsal bones are preserved in the\r\nrock in the same straight line with the smaller bones of the foot, or\r\nmake an angle with the shin bone, leading to the conviction that the\r\nbones of the foot were applied to the ground as in Man, and sometimes as\r\nin the Dog, and were thus modified for leaping. Just as the human\r\nmetacarpus is extended in the same line with the bones of the fore-arm,\r\nand the movement of jointing occurs where the fingers join the\r\nmetacarpus, so Pterodactyles also had these bones differently modified\r\nin the fore and hind limbs for the functions of life. The result is to\r\nlengthen the fore limb as compared with the hind limb by introducing\r\ninto it an elevation above the ground which corresponds to the length of\r\nthe metacarpus, always supposing that the animal commonly assumed the\r\nposition of a quadruped when upon the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nThis position of the metacarpus is a remarkable difference from Birds,\r\nbecause when the bird's wing is at rest it is folded into three\r\nportions. The upper arm bone extends backward, the bones of the fore-arm\r\nare bent upon it so as to extend forward, and then at the wrist the\r\nthird portion, which includes the metacarpus and finger bones, is bent\r\nbackward. So that the metacarpus in the Pterodactyle differs from birds\r\nin being in the same line as the bones of the fore-arm, whereas in birds\r\nit is in the same line with the digit bones of the hand. It is worthy of\r\nremark that in Bats, which are so suggestive of Pterodactyles in some\r\nfeatures of the hand, the metacarpals and phalanges are in the same\r\nstraight line; so that in this respect the bat is more like the bird.\r\nBut Pterodactyles in the relation of these bones to flight are quite\r\nunlike any other animal, and have nothing in common with the existing\r\nanimals named Reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAND\r\n\r\nFrom what has just been said it follows that the construction of the\r\nhand is unique. It may be contrasted with the foot of a bird. The bone\r\nwhich is called, in the language of anatomists, the tarso-metatarsus,\r\nand is usually free from feathers and covered with skin, is commonly\r\ncarried erect in birds, so that the whole body is supported upon it; and\r\nfrom it the toes diverge outward. It is formed in birds of three\r\nseparate bones blended together. In the fore limb of the Pterodactyle\r\nthe metacarpus has the same relation to the bones of the fore-arm that\r\nthe metatarsus has to the corresponding bones of the leg in a bird. But\r\nthe three metacarpal bones in the Pterodactyle remain distinct from each\r\nother, perhaps because the main work of that region of the skeleton has\r\ndevolved upon the digit called the wing finger, which is not recognised\r\nin the bird. In the Pterodactyles from the Solenhofen Slate there is a\r\nprogressive number of phalanges in the three small digits of the hand,\r\nwhich were applied to the ground. This number in the great majority of\r\nspecies follows the formula of two bones in the first, three bones in\r\nsecond, and four in the third; so that in the innermost of the clawed\r\ndigits only one bone intervenes between the metacarpal and the claw. The\r\nfingers slightly increase in length with increase in number of bones\r\nwhich form them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 45.  CLAW PHALANGE FROM THE HAND IN\r\n  ORNITHOCHEIRUS. (Half natural size)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 46.  METACARPUS AND DIGITS OF THE HAND IN BIRDS\r\n  WITH CLAWS]\r\n\r\nThe terminal claw bones are unlike the claws of Birds or Reptiles. They\r\nare compressed from side to side, and extremely deep and strong, with\r\nevidence of powerful attachment for ligaments, so that they rather\r\nresemble in their form and large size the claws of some of the\r\ncarnivorous fossil reptiles, often grouped as Dinosauria, such as have\r\nbeen termed Aristosuchus and Megalosaurus. In the hand of the Ostrich\r\nthe first and second digits terminate in claws, while the third is\r\nwithout a claw. But these claws of the Ostrich and other birds are\r\nslender, curved, and rather feeble organs. In the Archaeopteryx, a fossil\r\nbird which agrees with the Pterodactyles in retaining the separate\r\ncondition of the metacarpal bones and in having the same number of\r\nphalanges in two of the fingers of the fore limb, the terminal claws are\r\nrather more compressed from side to side, and stronger than in the\r\nOstrich, but not nearly so strong as in the Pterodactyle. The\r\nArchaeopteryx differs from the Pterodactyle in having no trace of a wing\r\nfinger. The first metacarpal bone is short, as in all birds; and the\r\nfirst phalange scarcely lengthens that segment of the first digit of the\r\nBird's hand to the same length as the other metacarpal bones. It\r\ntherefore was not bent backward like the first digit in Pterodactyles.\r\nThe wing finger, from which the genius of Cuvier selected the scientific\r\nname--Pterodactyle--for these fossils, yields their most distinctive\r\ncharacter. It is a feature which could only be partly paralleled in the\r\nBat, by making changes of structure which would remove every support to\r\nthe wing but the outermost digit of that animal's hand. In the Bat's\r\nhand the membrane for flight is extended chiefly by four diverging\r\nmetacarpal bones. There are only two or three phalanges in each digit in\r\nits four wing fingers. In Pterodactyles the metacarpal bones are, as we\r\nhave seen, arranged in close contact, and take no part in stretching the\r\nwing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WING FINGER\r\n\r\nIn Birds there is nothing whatever to represent the wing finger of the\r\nPterodactyle, for it is an organ external to the finger bones of the\r\nbird, and contains four phalanges. The first phalange is quite different\r\nfrom the others. Its length is astonishing when compared with the small\r\nphalanges of the clawed fingers. The articular surface, which joins on\r\nto the wing metacarpal bone, is a concave articulation, which fits the\r\npulley in which that bone ends. The pulley articulation admits of an\r\nextension movement in one direction only. Many specimens show the wing\r\nfinger to be folded up so as to extend backward. The whole finger is\r\npreserved in other specimens straightened out so as to be in line with\r\nthe metacarpus. This condition is well seen in Professor Marsh's\r\nspecimen of Rhamphorhynchus, which has the wing membrane preserved, in\r\nwhich all bones of the fore-arm metacarpus and wing finger are extended\r\nin a continuous curve. The outer surface of the end of the first bone of\r\nthe wing finger overlaps the wing metacarpal, so that a maximum of\r\nstrength and resistance is provided in the bony structures by which the\r\nwing is supported. There is, therefore, in flight only one angular bend\r\nin the limb, and that is between the upper arm bone and the fore-arm.\r\n\r\nAn immense pneumatic foramen is situate in a groove on the under side of\r\nthe upper end of the first phalange in Ornithocheirus, but is absent in\r\nspecimens from the Kimeridge clay. This bone is long and stout. It\r\nterminates at the lower end in an obliquely truncated articular surface.\r\nSpecimens occur in the Cambridge Greensand which are 2 inches broad at\r\nthe upper end and nearly 1-1/2 inch wide at the lower end. An imperfect\r\nbone from the Chalk is 14-1/2 inches long. The bones are all flattened.\r\nSpecimens from the Chalk of Kansas at Munich are 28 inches long. The\r\nsecond phalange is concave at the upper articular end and convex in the\r\nlonger direction at the lower end. The articular points of union between\r\nthe several phalanges form prominences on the under side of the finger\r\nin consequence of the adjacent bones being a little widened at their\r\njunction. It should be mentioned that there is a proximal epiphysis or\r\nseparate bone to the first phalange, adjacent to the pulley joint of the\r\nmetacarpal bone, which is like the separate olecranon process of the\r\nulna of the fore-arm. It sometimes comes away in specimens from the\r\nChalk and Cambridge Greensand, leaving a large circular pit with a\r\ndepressed narrow border. On the outer side of this process is a rounded\r\nboss, which may possibly have supported the bone, if it were applied to\r\nthe ground with the wing folded up, like the wing of a Bat directed\r\nupward and backward at the animal's side.\r\n\r\nThe four bones of the wing finger usually decrease progressively in\r\nlength, so that in Rhamphorhynchus, in which the length of the animal's\r\nhead only slightly exceeds 3-1/2 inches, the first phalange is nearly as\r\nlong, the second phalange is about 3-1/4 inches, the third 2-3/4 inches,\r\nand the fourth a little over 2 inches. Thus the entire length of the\r\nfour phalanges slightly exceeds 11 inches, or rather more than three\r\ntimes the length of the head. But the fore-arm and metacarpus in this\r\ntype only measure 3 inches. Therefore the entire spread of wings could\r\nnot have been more than 2 feet 9 inches.\r\n\r\nThe largest Ornithosaur in which accurate measurements have been made is\r\nthe toothless Pterodactyle Ornithostoma, also named Pteranodon, from\r\nNorth America. In that type the head appears to have been about 3 or 4\r\nfeet long, and the wing finger exceeded 5 feet; while the length of the\r\nfore-arm and metacarpus exceeded 3 feet. The width of the body would not\r\nhave been more than 1 foot. The length of the short humerus, which was\r\nabout 11 inches, did not add greatly to the stretch of the wing; so that\r\nthe spread of the wings as stretched in flight may be given as probably\r\nnot exceeding 17 or 18 feet. A fine example of the wing bones of this\r\nanimal quite as large has been obtained by the (British Museum Natural\r\nHistory). Many years ago, on very fragmentary materials, I estimated the\r\nwings in the English Cretaceous Ornithocheirus as probably having a\r\nstretch of 20 feet in the largest specimens, basing the calculation\r\npartly upon the extent of the longest wings in existing birds relatively\r\nto their bones, and partly upon the size of the largest associated bones\r\nwhich were then known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF THE ANIMAL'S HABITS FROM ITS REMAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the more remarkable characters of the bones in a type of animal\r\nlife which was more anomalous than any other which peopled the earth in\r\nthe Secondary Epoch of geological time. Its skeleton in different parts\r\nresembles Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals; with modifications and\r\ncombinations so singular that they might have been deemed impossible if\r\nNature's power of varying the skeleton could be limited. Since\r\nOrnithosaurs were provided with wings, we may believe the animals to\r\nsome extent to have resembled birds in habit. Their modes of progression\r\nwere more varied, for the structures indicate an equal capacity for\r\nmovement on land as a biped, or as a quadruped, with movement in the\r\nair. There is little evidence to support the idea that they were usually\r\naquatic animals. The majority of birds which frequent the water have\r\ntheir bodies stored with fat and the bones of their extremities filled\r\nwith marrow. And a bird's marrow bones are stouter and stronger than\r\nthose which are filled with air. There are few, if any, bones of\r\nPterodactyles so thick as to suggest the conclusion that they contained\r\nmarrow, and the bones of the extremities appear to have been\r\nconstructed on the lightest type found among terrestrial birds. Their\r\nthinness, except in a few specimens from the Wealden rocks, is\r\nmarvellous; and all the later Pterodactyles show the arrangement, as in\r\nbirds, by which air from the lungs is conveyed to the principal bones.\r\nNo Pterodactyle has shown any trace of the web-footed condition seen in\r\nbirds which swim on the water, unless the diverging bones of the hind\r\nfoot in Rhamphorhynchus supports that inference. The bones of the hind\r\nfoot are relatively small, and if it were not that a bird stands easily\r\nupon one foot, might be considered scarcely adequate to support the\r\nanimal in the position which terrestrial birds usually occupy. Yet, as\r\ncompared with the length and breadth of the foot in an Ostrich, the toes\r\nof an Ornithosaur are seen to be ample for support. These facts appear\r\nto discourage the idea that the animals were equally at home on land and\r\nwater, and in air.\r\n\r\nSome light may be thrown upon the animal's habits by the geological\r\ncircumstances under which the remains are found. The Pterodactyle named\r\nDimorphodon, from the Lias of the south of England, is associated with\r\nevidences of terrestrial land animals, the best known of which is\r\nScelidosaurus, an armoured Dinosaur adapted by its limbs for progression\r\non land. And the Pterodactyle Campylognathus, from the Lias of Whitby,\r\nis associated with trunks of coniferous trees and remains of Insects. So\r\nthat the occurrence of Pterodactyles in a marine stratum is not\r\ninconsistent with their having been transported by streams from off the\r\nold land surface of the Lias, on which coniferous trees grew and\r\nDinosaurs lived.\r\n\r\nSimilar considerations apply to the occurrence of the Rhamphocephalus in\r\nthe Stonesfield Slate of England. The deposit is not only formed in\r\nshallow water, but contains terrestrial Insects, a variety of land\r\nplants, and many Reptiles and other animals which lived upon land. The\r\nspecimens from the Purbeck beds, again, are in strata which yield a\r\nmultitude of the spoils of a nearly adjacent land surface; while the\r\nnumerous remains found in the marine Solenhofen Slate in Germany are\r\nsimilarly associated with abundant evidences of varied types of\r\nterrestrial life. The evidence grows in force from its cumulative\r\ncharacter. The Wealden beds, which yield many terrestrial reptiles and\r\nso much evidence of terrestrial vegetation, and shallow-water conditions\r\nof disposition, have afforded important Pterodactyle remains from the\r\nIsle of Wight and Sussex.\r\n\r\nThe chief English deposit in which these fossils are found, the Upper\r\nGreensand, has afforded thousands of bones, battered and broken on a\r\nshore, where they have lain in little associated groups of remains,\r\noften becoming overgrown with small marine shells. Side by side with\r\nthem are found bones of true terrestrial Lizards and Crocodiles of the\r\ntype of the Gavial of the Indian rivers, many terrestrial Dinosaurs, and\r\nother evidences of land life, including fossil resins, such as are met\r\nwith in the form of amber or copal at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe great bones of Pterodactyles found in the Chalk of Kent, near\r\nRochester, became entombed, beyond question, far from a land surface.\r\nThere is nothing to show whether the animals died on land and were\r\ndrifted out to sea like the timber which is found water-logged and\r\nsunken after being drilled by the ship-worm (Teredo) of that epoch.\r\nSeeing the power of flight which the animal possessed, storms may have\r\nstruck down travellers from time to time, when far from land.\r\n\r\nEvidence of habit of another kind may be found in their teeth. They are\r\nbrightly enamelled, sharp, formidable; and are frequently long,\r\noverlapping the sides of the jaws. They are organs which are often\r\nbetter adapted for grasping than for tearing, as may be seen in the\r\ninclined teeth of Rhamphocephalus of the Stonesfield Slate; and better\r\nadapted for killing than tearing, from their piercing forms and cutting\r\nedges, in genera like Ornithocheirus of the Greensand. The manner in\r\nwhich the teeth were implanted and carried is better paralleled by the\r\nfish-eating crocodile of Indian rivers than by the flesh-eating\r\ncrocodiles, or Muggers, which live indifferently in rivers and the sea.\r\nAs the Kingfisher finds its food (see Fig. 20) from the surface of the\r\nwater without being in the common sense of the term a water bird, so\r\nsome Pterodactyles may have fed on fish, for which their teeth are well\r\nadapted, both in the stream and by the shore.\r\n\r\nA Pterodactyle's teeth vary a good deal in appearance. The few large\r\nteeth in the front of the jaw in Dimorphodon, associated with the many\r\nsmall vertical teeth placed further backward, suggest that the taking of\r\nfood may have been a process requiring leisure, since the hinder teeth\r\nadapted to mincing the animal's meat are extremely small. The way in\r\nwhich the teeth are shaped and arranged differs with the genera. In\r\nPterodactylus they are short and broad and few, placed for the most part\r\ntowards the front of the jaws. Their lancet-shaped form indicates a\r\nshear-like action adapted to dividing flesh. In the associated genus\r\nRhamphorhynchus the teeth are absent from the extremity of the jaw, are\r\nslender, pointed, spaced far apart, and extend far backward. When the\r\njaws of the Rhamphorhynchus are brought together there is always a gap\r\nbetween them in front, which has led to belief that the teeth were\r\nreplaced by some kind of horny armature which has perished. In the\r\nlong-nosed English type of Ornithocheirus the jaws are compressed\r\ntogether, so that the teeth of the opposite sides are parallel to each\r\nother, with the margins well filled with teeth, which are never in close\r\ncontact, though occasionally closer and larger in front, in some of the\r\nforms with thick truncated snouts.\r\n\r\nIt is not the least interesting circumstance of the dentition of\r\nPterodactyles that, associated in the same deposits with these most\r\nrecent genera with teeth powerfully developed, there is a genus named\r\nOrnithostoma from the resemblance of its mouth to that of a bird in\r\nbeing entirely devoid of teeth. It is scarcely possible to distinguish\r\nthe remains of the toothed and toothless skeletons except in the dentary\r\ncharacter of the jaws. There is no evidence that the toothless types\r\never possessed a tooth of any sort. They were first found in fragments\r\nin England in the Cambridge Greensand, but were afterwards met with in\r\ngreat abundance in the Chalk of Kansas, where the same animals were\r\nnamed Pteranodon. A jaw so entirely bird-like suggests that the\r\ndigestive organs of Pterodactyles may in such toothless forms at least\r\nhave been characterised by a gizzard, which is so distinctive of Birds.\r\nThe absence of teeth in the Great Ant-eater and some other allied\r\nMammals has transferred the function which teeth usually perform to the\r\nstomach, one part of which becomes greatly thickened and muscular,\r\nadapting itself to the work which it has to perform. It is probable that\r\nthe gizzard may be developed in relation to the necessities which food\r\ncreates, since even Trout, feeding on the shell-fish in some Irish\r\nlochs, acquire such a thickened muscular stomach, and a like\r\nmodification is recorded in other fishes as produced by food.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with an animal's habits is the protection to the body\r\nwhich is afforded by the skin. In Pterodactyles the evidence of the\r\ncondition of the skin is scanty, and mostly negative. Sometimes the\r\ndense, smooth texture of the jaw bones indicates a covering like the\r\nskin of a Lizard or the hinder part of the jaw of a Bird. Some jaws from\r\nthe Cambridge Greensand have the bone channeled over its surface by\r\nminute blood vessels which have impressed themselves into the bone more\r\neasily than into its covering. Thus in the species of Ornithocheirus\r\ndistinguished as _microdon_ the palate is absolutely smooth, while in\r\nthe species named _machaerorhynchus_ it is marked by parallel impressed\r\nvascular grooves which diverge from the median line. This condition\r\nclearly indicates a difference in the covering of the bone, and that in\r\nthe latter species the covering had fewer blood vessels and more horny\r\nprotection than in the other. The tissue may not have been of firmer\r\nconsistence than in the palate of Mammals. The extremity of the beak is\r\noften as full of blood vessels as the jaw of a Turtle or Crocodile.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVERING OF THE BODY\r\n\r\nThere is no trace even in specimens from the Solenhofen or Stonesfield\r\nSlate of any covering to the body. There are no specimens preserved like\r\nmummies, and although the substance of the wings is found there is no\r\ntrace of fur or feathers, bones, or scales on the skin. The only example\r\nin which there is even an appearance suggesting feathers is in the\r\nbeautiful Scaphognathus at Bonn, and upon portions of the wing membrane\r\nof that specimen are preserved a very few small short and apparently\r\ntubular bodies, which have a suggestive resemblance to the quills of\r\nsmall undeveloped feathers. Such evidences have been diligently sought\r\nfor. Professor Marsh, after examining the wing membranes of his specimen\r\nof Rhamphorhynchus from Solenhofen, stated that the wings were partially\r\nfolded and naturally contracted into folds, and that the surface of the\r\ntissue is marked by delicate striae, which might easily be taken at first\r\nsight for a thin coating of hair. Closer investigation proved the\r\nmarkings to be minute wrinkles on the under surface of the wing\r\nmembrane. This negative evidence has considerable value, because the\r\nSolenhofen Slate has preserved in the two known examples of the bird\r\nArchaeopteryx beautiful details of the structure of the larger feathers\r\nconcerned in flight. It has preserved many structures far more delicate.\r\nThere is, therefore, reason for believing that if the skin had possessed\r\nany covering like one of those found in existing vertebrate animals, it\r\ncould scarcely have escaped detection in the numerous undisturbed\r\nskeletons of Pterodactyles which have been examined.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a recognisable covering to the skin in a fossil state\r\ncannot be accepted as conclusive evidence of the temperature, habits, or\r\naffinities of the animal. Although Mammalia are almost entirely clothed\r\nwith dense hair, which has never been found in a recognisable condition\r\nin a fossil state in any specimen of Tertiary age, one entire order, the\r\nCetacea, show in the smooth hairless skins of Whales and Porpoises that\r\nthe class may part with the typical characteristic covering without loss\r\nof temperature and without intelligible cause. That the absence of hair\r\nis not due to the aquatic conditions of rivers or sea is proved by other\r\nmarine Mammals, like Seals, having the skin clothed with a dense growth\r\nof hair, which is not surpassed in any other order. The fineness of the\r\ngrowth of hair in Man gives a superficial appearance of the skin being\r\nimperfectly clothed, and a similar skin in a fossil state might give the\r\nimpression that it was devoid of hair. There are many Mammals in which\r\nthe skin is scantily clothed with hair as the animal grows old. Neither\r\nthe Elephant nor the Armadillo in a fossil state would be likely to have\r\nthe hair preserved, for the growth is thin on the bony shields of the\r\nliving Armadilloes. Yet the difficulty need be no more inherent in the\r\nnature of hair than in that of feathers, since the hair of the Mammoth\r\nand Rhinoceros has been completely preserved upon their skins in the\r\ntundras of Siberia, densely clothing the body. This may go to show that\r\nthe Pterodactyle possessed a thin covering of hair, or, more probably,\r\nthat hair was absent. Since Reptiles are equally variable in the\r\nclothing of the skin with bony or horny plates, and in sometimes having\r\nno such protection, it may not appear singular that the skin in\r\nOrnithosaurs has hitherto given no evidence of a covering. From analogy\r\na covering might have been expected; feathers of Birds and hair of\r\nMammals are non-conducting coverings suited to arrest the loss of heat.\r\n\r\nWith the evidence, such as it is, of resemblance of Ornithosaurs to\r\nBirds in some features of respiration and flight, a covering to the skin\r\nmight have been expected. Yet the covering may not be necessary to a\r\nhigh temperature of the blood. Since Dr. John Davy made his observations\r\nit has been known that the temperature of the Tunny, above 90 deg.\r\nFahrenheit, is as warm as the African scaly ant-eater named the\r\nPangolin, which has the body more amply protected by its covering. This\r\nillustration also shows that hot blood may be produced without a\r\nfour-celled heart, with which it is usually associated, and that even if\r\nthe skin in Pterodactyles was absolutely naked an active life and an\r\nabundant supply of blood could have given the animal a high temperature.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that in several individuals the substance of the wing\r\nmembrane is preserved would appear to indicate either that it was\r\nexceptionally stout when there would have been small chance of resisting\r\ndecomposition, or that its preservation is due to a covering which once\r\nexisted of fur or down or other clothing substance, which has proved\r\nmore durable than the skin itself.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 48.  REMAINS OF DIMORPHODON FROM THE LIAS OF LYME\r\n  REGIS\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE SKULL, NECK, BACK AND SOME OF THE LONGER BONES OF THE\r\n  SKELETON\r\n\r\n  _From a slab in the British Museum (Natural History)_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nANCIENT ORNITHOSAURS FROM THE LIAS\r\n\r\n\r\nCuvier's discourse on the revolutions of the Earth made the Pterodactyle\r\nknown to English readers early in the nineteenth century. Dr. Buckland,\r\nthe distinguished professor of Geology at Oxford, discovered in 1829 a\r\nfar larger specimen in the Lias of Lyme Regis, and it became known by a\r\nfigure published by the Geological Society, and by the description in\r\nhis famous Bridgewater Treatise, p. 164. This animal was tantalising in\r\nimperfect preservation. The bones were scattered in the clay, so as to\r\ngive no idea of the animal's aspect. Knowledge of its limbs and body has\r\nbeen gradually acquired; and now, for some years, the tail and most\r\nparts of the skeleton have been well known in this oldest and most\r\ninteresting British Pterodactyle.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Owen after some time separated the fossil as a distinct\r\ngenus, named Dimorphodon; for it was in many ways unlike the\r\nPterodactyles described from Bavaria. The name Dimorphodon indicated the\r\ntwo distinct kinds of teeth in the jaws, a character which is still\r\nunparalleled among Pterodactyles of newer age. There are a few large\r\npointed, piercing and tearing teeth in the front of the jaws, with\r\nsmaller teeth further back, placed among the tearing teeth in the upper\r\njaw; while in the lower jaw the small teeth are continuous, close-set,\r\nand form a fine cutting edge like a saw.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 49.  LEFT SIDE OF DIMORPHODON (RESTORED) AT REST]\r\n\r\nThe Dimorphodon has a short beak, a deep head, and deep lower jaw, which\r\nis overlapped by the cheek bones. The side of the head is occupied by\r\nfour vacuities, separated by narrow bars of bone. First, in front, is\r\nthe immense opening for the nostril, triangular in form, with the long\r\nupper side following the rounded curve of the face. A large triangular\r\nopening intervenes between the nose hole and the eye hole, scarcely\r\nsmaller than the former, but much larger than the orbit of the eye. The\r\neye hole is shaped like a kite or inverted pear. Further back still is a\r\nnarrower vertical opening known as the lateral or inferior temporal\r\nvacuity. The back of the head is badly preserved. The two principal\r\nskulls differ in depth, probably from the strains under which they were\r\npressed flat in the clay. A singular detail of structure is found in the\r\nextremity of the lower jaw, which is turned slightly downward, and\r\nterminates in a short toothless point. The head of Dimorphodon is\r\nabout eight inches long.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 50.  DIMORPHODON MACRONYX\r\n  RESTORED FORM OF THE ANIMAL]\r\n\r\nThe neck bones are of suitable stoutness and width to support the head.\r\nThe bones are yoked together by strong processes. The neck was about 6\r\ninches long, did not include more than seven bones, and appeared short\r\nowing only to the depth and size of the head. The length of the backbone\r\nwhich supported the ribs was also about 6 inches. Its joints are\r\nremarkably short when compared with those of the neck. The tail is about\r\n20 inches long.\r\n\r\nThe extreme length of the animal from the tip of the nose to the end of\r\nthe tail may have been 3 feet 4 inches, supposing it to have walked on\r\nall fours in the manner of a Reptile or Mammal. This may have been a\r\ncommon position, but Dimorphodon may probably also have been a biped.\r\nBefore 1875, when the first restoration appeared in the _Illustrated\r\nLondon News_, the legs had been regarded as too short to have supported\r\nthe animal, standing upon its hind limbs. They are here seen to be well\r\nadapted for such a purpose. The upper leg bone is 3-1/4 inches long, the\r\nlower leg bone is 4-1/2 inches long, and the singularly strong instep\r\nbones are firmly packed together side by side as in a leaping or jumping\r\nMammal, and measure 1-1/2 inches in length. Dimorphodon differs from\r\nseveral other Pterodactyles in having the hind limb provided with a\r\nfifth outermost short instep bone, to which two toe bones are attached.\r\nThese bones are elongated in a way that may be compared, on a small\r\nscale, with the elongation of the wing finger in the fore limb. The\r\ndigit was manifestly used in the same way as the wing finger, in partial\r\nsupport of a flying membrane, though its direction may have been upward\r\nand outward, rather than inward. There is no evidence of a pulley joint\r\nbetween the metatarsal and the adjacent phalange.\r\n\r\nThe height of the Dimorphodon, standing on its hind legs in the position\r\nof a Bird, with the wings folded upon the body in the manner of a Bird,\r\nwas about 20 inches. An ungainly, ill-balanced animal in aspect, but not\r\nmore so than many big-headed birds, and probably capable of resting upon\r\nthe instep bones as many birds do. The chief point of variation from the\r\nPterodactyle wing is in the relative length of the metacarpus in\r\nDimorphodon. It is shorter than the other bones in the wing, never\r\nexceeding 1-1/2 inches. The total length of all the arm bones down to\r\nthe point where the metacarpus might have touched the ground, or where\r\nthe wing finger is bent upon it, is about 9 inches, which gives a length\r\nof less than 6 inches below the upper arm bone. The four bones of the\r\nwing finger measure, from the point where the first bone bends upon the\r\nmetacarpus, less than 18 inches. So that the wings could only have been\r\ncarried in the manner of the wings of a Bat, folded at the side and\r\ndirected obliquely over the back when the animal moved on all fours. Its\r\nbody would appear to have been raised high above the ground, in a manner\r\nalmost unparalleled in Reptiles, and comparable to Birds and Mammals.\r\nDimorphodon is to be imagined in full flight, with the body extended\r\nlike that of a Bird, when the wings would have had a spread from side to\r\nside of about 4 feet 4 inches. As in other animals of this group, the\r\nthree claws on the front feet are larger than the similar four claws on\r\nthe hind feet; as though the fingers might have functions in grasping\r\nprey, which were not shared by the toes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 51.  DIMORPHODON MACRONYX WALKING AS A QUADRUPED\r\n  RESTORATION OF THE SKELETON]\r\n\r\nThe restorations give faithful pictures of the skeleton, and the form of\r\nthe body is built upon the indications of muscular structure seen in the\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nA second English Pterodactyle is found in the Upper Lias of Whitby. It\r\nis only known from an imperfect skull, published in 1888. It has the\r\ngreat advantage of preserving the bones in their natural relations to\r\neach other, and with a length of head probably similar to Dimorphodon\r\nshows that the depth at the back of the eye was much less; and the skull\r\nwants the arched contour of face seen in Dimorphodon. The head has the\r\nsame four lateral vacuities, but the nostril is relatively small and\r\nelongated, extending partly above the oval antorbital opening, which was\r\nlarger. There is thus a difference of proportion, but it is precisely\r\nsuch as might result from the species having the skull flatter. The head\r\nis easily distinguished by the small nostril, which is smaller than the\r\norbit of the eye. The animal is referred to another genus. The quadrate\r\nbones which give attachment to the lower jaw send a process inward to\r\nmeet the bones of the palate, which differ somewhat from the usual\r\ncondition. Two bony rods extend from the quadrate bones backward and\r\nupward to the sphenoid, and two more slender bones extend from the\r\nquadrate bones forward, and converge in a #V#-shape, to define the\r\ndivision between the openings of the nostrils on the palate. The\r\n#V#-shaped bone in front is called the vomer, while the hinder part is\r\ncalled pterygoid. The bones that extend backward to the sphenoid are not\r\neasily identified. This animal is one of the most interesting of\r\nPterodactyles from the very reptilian character exhibited in the back of\r\nthe head, which appears to be different from other specimens, which are\r\nmore like a bird in that region. Yet underneath this reptilian aspect,\r\nwith the bony bar at the side of the temporal region of the head formed\r\nby the squamosal and quadrate bones, defining the two temporal vacuities\r\nas in Reptiles, a mould is preserved of the cavity once occupied by the\r\nbrain, showing the chief details of structure of that organ, and proving\r\nthat in so far as it departs from the brain of a Bird it appears to\r\nresemble the brain of a Mammal, and is unlike the brain of a Reptile.\r\n\r\nThe Pterodactyles from the Lias of Germany are similar to the English\r\ntypes, in so far as they can be compared. In 1878 I had the opportunity\r\nof studying those which were preserved in the Castle at Banz, which\r\nProfessor Andreas Wagner, in 1860, referred to the new genus\r\nDorygnathus. The skull is unknown, but the lower jaw, 6-1/2 inches long,\r\nis less than 2-1/2 inches wide at the articulation with the quadrate\r\nbone in the skull. The depth of the lower jaw does not exceed 1/4 inch,\r\nso that it is in marked contrast to Buckland's Dimorphodon. The\r\nsymphysis, which completely blends the rami of the jaw, is short. As far\r\nas it extends it contains large tearing teeth, followed by smaller teeth\r\nbehind, like those of Dimorphodon. But this German fossil appears to\r\ndiffer from the English type in having the front of the lower jaw, for\r\nabout 3/4 inch, compressed from side to side into a sharp blade or\r\nspear, more marked than in any other Pterodactyle, and directed _upward_\r\ninstead of downward as in Dimorphodon. Nearly all the measurements in\r\nthe skeleton are practically identical with those of the English\r\nDimorphodon, and extend to the jaw, humerus, ulna and radius, wing\r\nmetacarpal, first phalange of the wing finger. The principal bones of\r\nthe hind limb appear to be a little shorter; but the scapula and\r\ncoracoid are slightly larger. All these bones are so similar in form to\r\nDimorphodon that they could not be separated from the Lyme Regis\r\nspecies, if they were found in the same locality.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 52.  DIMORPHODON MACRONYX WALKING AS A BIPED\r\n  _Based chiefly on remains in the British Museum_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 53.  LOWER JAW OF DORYGNATHUS SEEN FROM BELOW\r\n\r\n  From the Lower Lias of Germany, showing the spear in front of the\r\n  tooth sockets]\r\n\r\nJust as the Upper Lias in England has yielded a second Pterodactyle, so\r\nthe Upper Lias in Germany has yielded a skeleton, to which Felix\r\nPlieninger, in 1894, gave the name Campylognathus. It is an instructive\r\nskeleton, with the head much smaller than in Dimorphodon, being less\r\nthan 6 inches long, but, unfortunately, broken and disturbed. A lower\r\njaw gives the length 4-1/2 inches. Like the other Pterodactyles from\r\nthe Lias, it has the extremity of the beak toothless, with larger teeth\r\nin the region of the symphysis in front and smaller teeth behind. The\r\njaw is deeper than in the Banz specimen from the Lower Lias, but not so\r\ndeep as in Dimorphodon. The teeth of the upper jaw vary in size, and\r\nthere appears to be an exceptionally large tooth in the position of the\r\nMammalian canine at the junction of the bones named maxillary and\r\nintermaxillary.\r\n\r\nThe nasal opening is small and elongated, as in the English specimen\r\nfrom Whitby. As in that type there is little or no indication of the\r\nconvex contour of the face seen in Dimorphodon.\r\n\r\nThe neck does not appear to be preserved. In the back the vertebrae are\r\nabout 3/10 inch long, so that twelve, which is the usual number, would\r\nonly occupy a length of a little more than 3-1/2 inches. The tail is\r\nelongated like that of Dimorphodon, and bordered in the same way by\r\nossified ligaments. There are thirty-five tail vertebrae. Those which\r\nimmediately follow the pelvis are short, like the vertebrae of the back.\r\nBut they soon elongate, and reach a maximum length of nearly 1-1/2\r\ninches at the eighth, and then gradually diminish till the last scarcely\r\nexceeds 1/8 inch in length. The length of the tail is about 22 inches;\r\nthis appears to be an inch or two longer than in Dimorphodon. The\r\nlongest rib measures 2-1/2 inches, and the shortest 2 inches. These ribs\r\nprobably were connected with the sternum, which is imperfectly\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 54.  DIMORPHODON MACRONYX\r\n  SHOWING THE MAXIMUM SPREAD OF THE WING MEMBRANES]\r\n\r\nThe bones of the limbs have about the same length as those of\r\nDimorphodon, so far as they can be compared, except that the ulna and\r\nradius are shorter. The wing metacarpal is of about the same length, but\r\nthe first phalange of the wing finger measures 6-1/4 inches, the second\r\nis about 8-1/4 inches, the third 6-1/2 inches, and the fourth 4-3/4\r\ninches; so that the total length of the wing finger was about half an\r\ninch short of 2 feet. One character especially deserves attention in the\r\napparent successive elongation of the first three phalanges in the wing\r\nfinger in Dimorphodon. The third phalange is the longest in the only\r\nspecimen in which the finger bones are all preserved. Usually the first\r\nphalange is much longer than the second, so that it is a further point\r\nof interest to find that this German type shares with Dimorphodon a\r\ncharacter of the wing finger which distinguishes both from some members\r\nof the group by its short first phalange.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 55.  THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PELVIS OF DIMORPHODON\r\n  SHOWING THE TWO PREPUBIC BONES]\r\n\r\nThe pelvis is exceptionally strong in Campylognathus, and although it is\r\ncrushed the bones manifestly met at the base of the ischium, while the\r\npubic bones were separated from each other in front. The bones of the\r\nhind limb are altogether shorter in the German fossil than in\r\nDimorphodon, especially in the tibia; but the structure of the\r\nmetatarsus is just the same, even to the short fifth metatarsal with its\r\ntwo digits, only those bones are extremely short, instead of being\r\nelongated as in Dimorphodon. It is therefore convenient, from the\r\ndifferent proportions of the body, that Campylognathus may be separated\r\nfrom Dimorphodon; but so much as is preserved of the English specimen\r\nfrom the Upper Lias of Whitby rather favours the belief that our species\r\nshould also be referred to Campylognathus, which had not been figured\r\nwhen the Whitby skull was referred to Scaphognathus by Mr. Newton. It\r\nmay be doubtful whether there is sufficient evidence to establish the\r\ndistinctness of the other German genus Dorygnathus, though it may be\r\nretained pending further knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn these characters are grounds for placing the Lias Pterodactyles in a\r\ndistinct family, the Dimorphodontidae, as was suggested in 1870. This\r\nevidence is found in the five metatarsal bones, of which four are in\r\nclose contact, the middle two being slightly the longest, so as to\r\npresent the general aspect of the corresponding bones in a Mammal rather\r\nthan a Bird. Secondly, the very slender fibula, prolonged down the\r\nlength of the shin bone, which ends in a rounded pulley like the\r\ncorresponding bone of a Bird. Thirdly, the great elongation of the third\r\nwing phalange. Fourthly, the prolongation of the coracoid bone beyond\r\nthe articulation for the humerus, as in a Bird. And the toothless,\r\nspear-shaped beak, and jaw with large teeth in front and small teeth\r\nbehind, are also distinctive characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nORNITHOSAURS FROM THE MIDDLE SECONDARY ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nRHAMPHOCEPHALUS\r\n\r\nTHE Stonesfield Slate in England, which corresponds in age with the\r\nlower part of the Great or Bath Oolite, yields many evidences of\r\nterrestrial life--land plants, insects, and mammals--preserved in a\r\nmarine deposit. A number of isolated bones have been found of\r\nPterodactyles, some of them indicating animals of considerable size and\r\nstrength. The nature of the limestone was unfavourable to the\r\npreservation of soft wing membranes, or even to the bones remaining in\r\nnatural association. Very little is known of the head of\r\nRhamphocephalus. One imperfect specimen shows a long temporal region\r\nwhich is wide, and a very narrow interspace between the orbits; with a\r\nlong face, indicated by the extension of narrow nasal bones. The lower\r\njaw has an edentulous beak or spear in front, which is compressed from\r\nside to side in the manner of the Liassic forms, but turned upward\r\nslightly, as in Dorygnathus or Campylognathus. Behind this extremity are\r\nsharp, tall teeth, few in number, which somewhat diminish in size as\r\nthey extend backward, and do not suddenly change to smaller series, as\r\nin the Lias genera. A few small vertebrae have been found, indicating the\r\nneck and back. The sacrum consists of five vertebrae. One small example\r\nhas a length of only an inch. It is a little narrower behind than in\r\nfront, and would be consistent with the animal having had a long tail,\r\nwhich I believe to have been present, although I have not seen any\r\ncaudal vertebrae. The early ribs are like the early ribs of a Crocodile\r\nor Bird in the well-marked double articulation. The later ribs appear to\r\nhave but one head. #V#-shaped abdominal ribs are preserved. Much of the\r\nanimal is unknown. The coracoid seems to have been directed forward,\r\nand, as in a bird, it is 2-1/2 inches long. The humerus is 3-1/2 inches\r\nlong, and the fore-arm measured 6 inches, so that it was relatively\r\nlonger than in Dimorphodon. The metacarpus is 1-3/4 inches long. The\r\nwing finger was exceptionally long and strong. Professor Huxley gave its\r\nlength at 29 inches. My own studies lead to the conclusion that the\r\nfirst finger bone of the wing was the shorter, and that although they\r\ndid not differ greatly in length, the second was probably the longest,\r\nas in Campylognathus.\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley makes the second and third phalanges 7-3/4 inches long,\r\nand the first only about 3/8 inch shorter, while the fourth phalange is\r\n6-1/2 inches. These measurements are based upon some specimens in the\r\nOxford University Museum. There is only one first phalange which has a\r\nlength of 7-3/4 inches. The others are between 5 and 6 inches, or but\r\nlittle exceed 4 inches; so that as all the fourth phalanges which are\r\nknown have a length of 6-1/2 inches, it is possible that the normal\r\nlength of the first phalange in the larger species was 5-1/2 inches. The\r\nlargest of the phalanges which may be classed as second or third is\r\n8-1/2 inches, and that, I suppose, may have been associated with the\r\n7-3/4 inches first phalange. But the other bones which could have had\r\nthis position all measure 5-1/2 and 7-3/4 inches. The three species\r\nindicated by finger bones may have had the measurements:--\r\n\r\n     Phalanges of the wing finger\r\n   ________________/\\________________\r\n  |                                  |\r\n    I.

In Campylognathus, which has so\r\nmuch in common with the jaw and the wing bones in size, the upper leg\r\nbone is 2-8/10 inches. Therefore if we assign the larger femur to the\r\nlarger wing, the femur will be relatively longer in all species of\r\nRhamphocephalus than in Campylognathus. Only one example of a tibia is\r\npreserved. It is 3-1/2 inches long, or only 1/10 inch shorter than the\r\nbone in Campylognathus, which has the femur 2-8/10 inches, so that I\r\nrefer the tibia of Rhamphocephalus to the species which has the\r\nintermediate length of wing. These coincidences with Campylognathus\r\nestablish a close affinity, and may raise the question whether the Upper\r\nLias species may not be included in the Stonesfield Slate genus\r\nRhamphocephalus.\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Phillips, in his _Geology of Oxford_, attempted a\r\nrestoration of the Stonesfield Ornithosaur, and produced a picturesque\r\neffect (p. 164); but no restoration is possible without such attention\r\nto the proportions of the bones as we have indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXFORD CLAY\r\n\r\nA few bones of flying reptiles have been found in the Lower Oxford Clay\r\nnear Peterborough, and others in the Upper Oxford Clay at St. Ives, in\r\nHuntingdonshire. A single tail vertebra from the Middle Oxford Clay,\r\nnear Oxford, long since came under my own notice, and shows that these\r\nanimals belong to a long-tailed type like Campylognathus. The cervical\r\nvertebrae are remarkable for being scarcely longer than the dorsal\r\nvertebrae; and the dorsal are at least half as long again as is usual,\r\nhaving rather the proportion of bones in the back of a crocodile.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITHOGRAPHIC SLATE\r\n\r\nLong-tailed Pterodactyles are beautifully preserved in the Lithographic\r\nLimestone of the south of Bavaria, at Solenhofen, and the quarries in\r\nits neighbourhood, often with the skeleton or a large part of it\r\nflattened out in the plane of bedding of the rock. Fine skeletons are\r\npreserved in the superb museum at Munich, at Heidelberg, Bonn, Haarlem,\r\nand London, and are all referred to the genus Rhamphorhynchus or to\r\nScaphognathus. It is a type with powerfully developed wings and a long,\r\nstiff tail, very similar to that of Dimorphodon, so that some\r\nnaturalists refer both to the same family. There is some resemblance.\r\n\r\nThe type which is most like Dimorphodon is the celebrated fossil at\r\nBonn, sometimes called _Pterodactylus crassirostris_, which in a\r\nrestored form, with a short tail, has been reproduced in many\r\ntext-books. No tail is preserved in the slab, and I ventured to give the\r\nanimal a tail for the first time in a restoration (p. 163) published by\r\nthe _Illustrated London News_ in 1875, which accompanied a report of a\r\nRoyal Institution lecture. Afterwards, in 1882, Professor Zittel, of\r\nMunich, published the same conclusion. The reason for restoring the tail\r\nwas that the animal had the head constructed in the same way as\r\nPterodactyles with a long tail, and showed differences from types in\r\nwhich the tail is short; and there is no known short-tailed\r\nPterodactyle, with wrist and hand bones, such as characterise this\r\nanimal. The side of the face has a general resemblance to the\r\nPterodactyles from the Lias, for although the framework is firmer, the\r\nfour apertures in the head are similarly placed. The nostril is rather\r\nsmall and elongated, and ascends over the larger antorbital vacuity. The\r\norbit for the eye is the largest opening in the head, so that these\r\nthree apertures successively increase in size, and are followed by the\r\nvertically elongated post-orbital vacuity. The teeth are widely spaced\r\napart, and those in the skull extend some distance backward to the end\r\nof the maxillary bone. There are few teeth in the lower jaw, and they\r\ncorrespond to the large anterior teeth of Dimorphodon, there being no\r\nteeth behind the nasal opening. The lower jaw is straight, and the\r\nextremities of the jaws met when the mouth was closed. The breast bone\r\ndoes not show the keel which is so remarkable in Rhamphorhynchus, which\r\nmay be attributed to its under side being exposed, so as to exhibit the\r\npneumatic foramina.\r\n\r\nThe ribs have double heads, more like those of a Crocodile in the region\r\nof the back than is the case with the bird-like ribs from Stonesfield.\r\nThe second joint in the wing finger may be longer than the first--a\r\ncharacter which would tend to the association of this Pterodactyle with\r\nspecies from the Lias; a relation to which attention was first drawn by\r\nMr. E. T. Newton, who described the Whitby skull.\r\n\r\nThe Pterodactyles from the Solenhofen Slate which possess long tails\r\nhave a series of characters which show affinity with the other\r\nlong-tailed types. The jaws are much more slender. The orbit of the eye\r\nin Rhamphorhynchus is enormously large, and placed vertically above the\r\narticulation for the lower jaw. Immediately in front of the eye are two\r\nsmall and elongated openings, the hinder of which, known as the\r\nantorbital vacuity, is often slightly smaller than the nostril, which is\r\nplaced in the middle length of the head, or a little further back,\r\ngiving a long dagger-shaped jaw, which terminates in a toothless spear.\r\nThe lower jaw has a corresponding sharp extremity. The teeth are\r\ndirected forward in a way that is quite exceptional. Notwithstanding the\r\nmassiveness and elongation of the neck vertebrae, which are nearly twice\r\nas long as those of the back, the neck is sometimes only about half the\r\nlength of the skull.\r\n\r\nAll these long-tailed species from the Lithographic Stone agree in\r\nhaving the sternum broad, with a long strong keel, extending far\r\nforward. The coracoid bones extend outward like those of a Crocodile, so\r\nas to widen the chest cavity instead of being carried forward as the\r\nbones are in Birds. These bones in this animal were attached to the\r\nanterior extremity of the sternum, so that the keel extended in advance\r\nof the articulation as in other Pterodactyles. The breadth of the\r\nsternum shows that, as in Mammals, the fore part of the body must have\r\nbeen fully twice the width of the region of the hip-girdle, where the\r\nslenderer hind limbs were attached. The length of the fore limb was\r\nenormous, for although the head suggests an immense length relatively\r\nto the body, nearly equal to neck and back together, the head is not\r\nmore than a third of the length of the wing bones. The wing bones are\r\nremarkable for the short powerful humerus with an expanded radial crest,\r\nwhich is fully equal in width to half the length of the bone. Another\r\ncharacter is the extreme shortness of the metacarpus, usually associated\r\nwith immense strength of the wing metacarpal bone.\r\n\r\nThe hind limbs are relatively small and relatively short. The femur is\r\nusually shorter than the humerus, and the tibia is much shorter than the\r\nulna. The bones of the instep, instead of being held together firmly as\r\nin the Lias genera, diverge from each other, widening out, though it\r\noften happens that four of the five metatarsals differ but little in\r\nlength. The fifth digit is always shorter.\r\n\r\nThe hip-girdle of bones differs chiefly from other types in the way in\r\nwhich those bones, which have sometimes been likened to the marsupial\r\nbones, are conditioned. They may be a pair of triangular bones which\r\nmeet in the middle line, so that there is an outer angle like the arm of\r\na capital Y. Sometimes these triangular bones are blended into a curved,\r\nbow-shaped arch, which in several specimens appears to extend forward\r\nfrom near the place of articulation of the femur. This is seen in fossil\r\nskeletons at Heidelberg and Munich. It is possible that this position is\r\nan accident of preservation, and that the prepubic bones are really\r\nattached to the lower border of the pubic bones.\r\n\r\nImmense as the length of the tail appears to be, exceeding the skull and\r\nremainder of the vertebral column, it falls far short of the combined\r\nlength of the phalanges of the wing finger. The power of flight was\r\nmanifestly greater in Rhamphorhynchus than in other members of the\r\ngroup, and all the modifications of the skeleton tend towards adaptation\r\nof the animals for flying. The most remarkable modification of structure\r\nat the extremity of the tail was made known by Professor Marsh in a\r\nvertical, leaf-like expansion in this genus, which had not previously\r\nbeen observed (p. 161). The vertebrae go on steadily diminishing in\r\nlength in the usual way, and then the ossified structures which bordered\r\nthe tail bones and run parallel with the vertebrae in all the\r\nRhamphorhynchus family, suddenly diverge downward and upward at right\r\nangles to the vertebrae, forming a vertical crest above and a\r\ncorresponding keel below; and between these structures, which are\r\nidentified with the neural spines and chevron bones of ordinary\r\nvertebrae, the membrane extends, giving the extremity of the tail a\r\nrudder-like feature, which, from knowledge of the construction of the\r\ntail of a child's kite, may well be thought to have had influence in\r\ndirecting and steadying the animal's movements. There are many minor\r\nfeatures in the shoulder-girdle, which show that the coracoid, for\r\nexample, was becoming unlike that bone in the Lias, though it still\r\ncontinues to have a bony union with the elongated shoulder-blade of the\r\nback.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 56.

It\r\nis certain that there is one remarkable difference from other and older\r\nPterodactyles, in that the last or fourth bone in the wing finger is\r\nusually slightly longer than the third bone, which precedes it. There is\r\na certain variability in the specimens which makes discussion of their\r\ncharacters difficult, and has led to some forms being regarded as\r\nvarieties, while others, of which less material is available, are\r\nclassed as species. I am disposed to say that some of the confusion may\r\nhave resulted from specimens being wrongly named. Thus, there is a\r\nRhamphorhynchus called curtimanus, or the form with the short hand. It\r\nis represented by two types. One of these appears to have the humerus\r\nshort, the ulna and radius long, and the finger bones long; the other\r\nhas the humerus longer, the ulna much shorter, and the finger bones\r\nshorter. They are clearly different species, but the second variety\r\nagrees in almost every detail with a species named hirundinaceus, the\r\nswallow-like Rhamphorhynchus. This identification shows, not that the\r\nlatter is a bad species, but that curtimanus is a distinct species which\r\nhad sometimes been confounded with the other. While most of these\r\nspecimens show a small but steady decrease in the length of the several\r\nwing finger bones, the species called Gemmingi has the first three bones\r\nabsolutely equal and shorter than in the species curtimanus, longimanus,\r\nor hirundinaceus. In the same way, on the evidence of facts, I find\r\nmyself unable to join in discarding Professor Marsh's species phyllurus,\r\non account of the different proportions of its limb bones. The humerus,\r\nmetacarpus, and third phalange of the wing finger in _Rhamphorhynchus\r\nphyllurus_ are exceptionally short as compared with other species.\r\nEveryone agrees that the species called longicaudus is a distinct one,\r\nso that it is chiefly in slight differences in the proportions of\r\nconstituent parts of the skeleton that the types of the Rhamphorhynchus\r\nare distinguished from each other. I cannot quite concur with either\r\nProfessor Zittel (Fig. 58, 3) or Professor Marsh (Fig. 58, 2) in the\r\nexpansion which they give to the wing membrane in their restorations;\r\nfor although Professor Zittel represents the tail as free from the hind\r\nlegs, while Professor Marsh connects them together, they both concur in\r\ncarrying the wing membrane from the tip of the wing finger down to the\r\nextremity of the ankle joint. I should have preferred to carry it no\r\nfurther down the body than the lower part of the back, there being no\r\nfossil evidence in favour of this extension so far as specimens have\r\nbeen described. Neither the membranous wings figured by Zittel nor by\r\nMarsh would warrant so much body membrane as the Rhamphorhynchus has\r\nbeen credited with. I have based my restoration (p. 161) of the skeleton\r\nchiefly on _Rhamphorhynchus phyllurus._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHORT-TAILED TYPES\r\n\r\nThe Pterodactylia are less variable; and the variation among the species\r\nis chiefly confined to relative length of the head, length of the neck,\r\nand the height of the body above the ground. The tail is always so short\r\nas to be inappreciable. Many of the specimens are fragmentary, and the\r\ncharacters of the group are not easily determined without careful\r\ncomparisons and measurements. The bones of the fore limb and wing\r\nfinger are less stout than in the Rhamphorhynchus type, while the femur\r\nis generally a little longer than the humerus, and the wing finger is\r\nshort in comparison with its condition in Rhamphorhynchus. These\r\nshort-tailed Pterodactyles give the impression of being active little\r\nanimals, having very much the aspect of birds, upon four legs or two.\r\nThe neck is about as long as the lower jaw, the antorbital vacuity in\r\nthe head is imperfectly separated from the much larger nasal opening,\r\nthe orbit of the eye is large and far back, the teeth are entirely in\r\nfront of the nasal aperture, and the post-orbital vacuity is minute and\r\ninconspicuous. The sternum is much wider than long, and no specimens\r\ngive evidence of a manubrium. The finger bones progressively decrease in\r\nlength. The prepubic bones have a partially expanded fan-like form, and\r\nnever show the triradiate shape, and are never anchylosed. About fifteen\r\ndifferent kinds of Pterodactyles have been described from the Solenhofen\r\nSlate, mostly referred to the genus Pterodactylus, which comprises forms\r\nwith a large head and long snout. Some have been placed in a genus\r\n(Ornithocephalus, or Ptenodracon) in which the head is relatively short.\r\nThe majority of the species are relatively small. The skull in\r\n_Ornithocephalus brevirostris_ is only 1 inch long, and the animal could\r\nnot have stood more than 1-1/2 inches to its back standing on all fours,\r\nand but little over 2-1/2 inches standing as a biped, on the hind limbs.\r\n\r\nA restoration of the species called _Pterodactylus scolopaciceps_,\r\npublished in 1875 in the _Illustrated London News_ in the position of a\r\nquadruped, shows an animal a little larger, with a body 2-1/2 inches\r\nhigh and 6 to 7 inches long, with the wing finger 4-1/2 inches long.\r\nLarger animals occur in the same deposit, and in one named\r\n_Pterodactylus grandis_ the leg bones are a foot long; and such an\r\nanimal may have been nearly a foot in height to its back, standing as a\r\nquadruped, though most of these animals had the neck flexible and\r\ncapable of being raised like the neck of a Goose or a Deer (p. 30), and\r\nbent down like a Duck's when feeding.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 59.  RESTORATION OF THE SKELETON OF _PTENODRACON\r\n  BREVIROSTRIS_\r\n\r\n  From the Solenhofen Slate. The fourth joint of the wing finger appears\r\n  to be lost and has not been restored in the figure. (Natural size)]\r\n\r\nThe type of the genus Pterodactylus is the form originally described by\r\nCuvier as_ Pterodactylus longirostris_ (p. 28). It is also known as _P.\r\nantiquus_, that name having been given by a German naturalist after\r\nCuvier had invented the genus, and before he had named the species.\r\nThere are some remarkable features in which Cuvier's animal is distinct\r\nfrom others which have been referred to the same genus. Thus the head is\r\n4-1/2 inches long, while the entire length of the backbone to the\r\nextremity of the tail is only 6-1/2 inches, and one vertebra in the neck\r\nis at least as long as six in the back, so that the animal has the\r\ngreater part of its length in the head and neck, although the neck\r\nincludes so few vertebrae. Nearly all the teeth--which are few in number,\r\nshort and broad, not exceeding a dozen in either jaw--are limited to the\r\nfront part of the beak, and do not extend anywhere near the nasal\r\nvacuity. This is not the case with all.\r\n\r\nIn the species named _P. Kochi_, which I have regarded as the type of a\r\ndistinct genus, there are large teeth in the front of the jaw\r\ncorresponding to those of Pterodactylus, and behind these a smaller\r\nseries of teeth extending back under the nostril, which approaches close\r\nto the orbit of the eye, without any indication of a separate antorbital\r\nvacuity. On those characters the genus Diopecephalus was defined. It is\r\nclosely allied to Pterodactylus; both agree in having the ilium\r\nprolonged forward more than twice as far as it is carried backward, the\r\nanterior process covering about half a dozen vertebrae, as in\r\n_Pterodactylus longirostris_. A great many different types have been\r\nreferred to _Pterodactylus Kochi_, and it is probable that they may\r\neventually be distinguished from each other. The species in which the\r\nupper borders of the orbits approximate could be separated from those in\r\nwhich the frontal interspace is wider.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 60.  CYCNORHAMPHUS SUEVICUS FROM THE SOLENHOFEN\r\n  SLATE SHOWING THE SCATTERED POSITION OF THE BONES\r\n\r\n  _Original in the Museum at Tuebingen_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 61.  CYCNORHAMPHUS SUEVICUS\r\n  RESTORATION SHOWING THE FORM OF THE BODY AND THE WING MEMBRANES]\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable feature in these animals that the middle bones of the\r\nfoot, termed instep bones or metatarsals, are usually close together, so\r\nthat the toes diverge from a narrow breadth, as in _P. longirostris_,\r\n_P. Kochi_, and other forms; but there also appear to be splay-footed\r\ngroups of Pterodactyles like the species which have been named _P.\r\nelegans_ and _P. micronyx_, in which the metatarsus widens out so that\r\nthe bones of the toes do not diverge, and that condition characterises\r\nthe Ptenodracon (_Pterodactylus brevirostris_), to which genus these\r\nspecies may possibly be referred. Nearly all who have studied these\r\nanimals regard the singularly short-nosed species _P. brevirostris_ as\r\nforming a separate genus. For that genus Soemmerring's descriptive name\r\nOrnithocephalus, which he used for Pterodactyles generally, might\r\nperhaps have been retained. But the name Ptenodracon, suggested by Mr.\r\nLydekker, has been used for these types.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 62.  _CYCNORHAMPHUS SUEVICUS_\r\n\r\n  Skeleton restored from the bones in Fig. 60]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 63.  RESTORATION OF SKELETON CYCNORHAMPHUS FRAASI\r\n  SHOWING THE LIMBS ON THE RIGHT SIDE\r\n\r\n  _From a specimen in the Museum at Stuttgart_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 64.  CYCNORHAMPHUS FRAASI\r\n  RESTORATION OF THE FORM OF THE BODY]\r\n\r\nSome of the largest specimens preserved at Stuttgart and Tuebingen have\r\nbeen named _Pterodactylus suevicus_ and _P. Fraasii_. They do not\r\napproach the species _P. grandis_ in size, so far as can be judged from\r\nthe fragmentary remains figured by Von Meyer; for what appears to be the\r\nthird phalange of the wing finger is 7-1/2 inches long, while in these\r\nspecies it is less than half that length, indicating an enormous\r\ndevelopment of wing, relatively to the length of the hind limb, which\r\nwould probably refer the species to another genus. _Pterodactylus\r\nsuevicus_ differs from the typical Pterodactyles in having a rounded,\r\nflattened under surface to the lower jaw, instead of the common\r\ncondition of a sharp keel in the region of the symphysis. The beak also\r\nseems flattened and swan-like, and the teeth are limited to the front of\r\nthe jaw. There appear to be some indications of small nostrils, which\r\nlook upward like the nostrils of Rhamphorhynchus, but this may be a\r\ndeceptive appearance, and the nostrils are large lateral vacuities,\r\nwhich are in the position of antorbital vacuities, so that there would\r\nappear to be only two vacuities in the side of the head in these\r\nanimals. The distinctive character of the skeleton in this genus is\r\nfound in the extraordinary length of the metacarpus and in the complete\r\nossification of the smaller metacarpal bones throughout their length.\r\nThe metacarpal bones are much longer than the bones of the fore-arm, and\r\nabout twice the length of the humerus. The first wing phalange is much\r\nlonger than the others, which successively and rapidly diminish in\r\nlength, so that the third is half the length of the first. There are\r\ndifferences in the pelvis; for the anterior process of the ilium is very\r\nshort, in comparison with its length in the genus Pterodactylus. And the\r\nlong stalk of the prepubic bone with its great hammer-headed expansion\r\ntransversely in front gives those bones a character unlike other genera,\r\nso that Cycnorhamphus ranks as a good genus, easily distinguished from\r\nCuvier's type, in which the four bones of the wing are more equal in\r\nlength, and the last is more than half the length of the first; while\r\nthe metacarpus in that genus is only a little longer than the humerus,\r\nand much shorter than the ulna. The _Pterodactylus suevicus_ has the\r\nneck vertebrae flat on the under side, and relatively short as compared\r\nwith the more slender and narrower vertebrae of _P. Fraasii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nORNITHOSAURS FROM THE UPPER SECONDARY ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen staying at Swanage, in Dorsetshire, many years ago, I had the rare\r\ngood fortune to obtain from the Purbeck Beds the jaw of a Pterodactyle,\r\nwhich had much in common in plan with the _Cycnorhamphus Fraasii_ from\r\nthe Lithographic Slate, which is preserved at Stuttgart. The\r\ntooth-bearing part of this lower jaw is 8 inches long as preserved,\r\nextending back 3 inches beyond the symphysis portion in which the two\r\nsides are blended together. It is different from Professor Fraas's\r\nspecimen in having the teeth carried much further back, and in the\r\nanimal being nearly twice as large. This fragment of the jaw is little\r\nmore than 1 foot long, which is probably less than half its original\r\nlength. A vertebra nearly 5 inches long, which is more than twice the\r\nlength of the longest neck bones in the Stuttgart fossil, is the only\r\nindication of the vertebral column. Professor Owen described a wing\r\nfinger bone from these Purbeck Beds, which is nearly 1 foot long. He\r\nterms it the second of the finger. It may be the third, and on the\r\nhypothesis that the animal had the proportions of the Solenhofen fossil\r\njust referred to, the first wing finger bone of the English Purbeck\r\nPterodactyle would have exceeded 2 feet in length, and would give a\r\nlength for the wing finger of about 5 feet 3 inches. For this animal the\r\nname Doratorhynchus was suggested, but at present I am unable to\r\ndistinguish it satisfactorily from Cycnorhamphus, which it resembles in\r\nthe forms both of the neck bones and of the jaw. Very small\r\nPterodactyles are also found in the English Purbeck strata, but the\r\nremains are few, and scattered, like these larger bones.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 65.  THE LONGEST KNOWN NECK VERTEBRA\r\n\r\n  From the Purbeck Beds of Swanage. (Half natural size)]\r\n\r\n\r\nORNITHODESMUS LATIDENS\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 66.  CERVICAL VERTEBRA OF ORNITHODESMUS\r\n\r\n  From the Wealden Beds of the Isle of Wight]\r\n\r\nThe Wealden strata being shallow, fresh-water deposits might have been\r\nexpected to supply better knowledge of Pterodactyles than has hitherto\r\nbeen available. Jaws of Ornithocheirus sagittirostris have been found\r\nin the beds at Hastings, and in other parts of Sussex. Some fragments\r\nare as large as anything known. The best-preserved remains have come\r\nfrom the Isle of Wight, and were rewards to the enthusiastic search of\r\nthe Rev. W. Fox, of Brixton. In the principal specimen the teeth were\r\nshort and wide, the head large and deep with large vacuities, but the\r\nsmall brain case of that skull is bird-like. The neck bones are 2-1/2\r\ninches long. In the upper part of the back the bones are united together\r\nby anchylosis, so that they form a structure in the back like a sacrum,\r\nwhich does not give attachment to the scapula, as in some Pterodactyles\r\nfrom the Chalk, but the bones are simply blended, as in the\r\nfrigate-bird, allied to Pelicans and Cormorants. And then after a few\r\nfree vertebrae in the lower part of the back, succeeds the long sacrum,\r\nformed in the usual way, of many vertebrae. I described a sacrum of this\r\ntype from the Wealden Beds, under the name _Ornithodesmus_, referable to\r\nanother species, which in many respects was so like the sacrum of a Bird\r\nthat I could not at the time separate it from the bird type. This genus\r\nhas a sternum with a strong deep keel, and the articulation for the\r\ncoracoid bones placed at the back of the keel in the usual way, but with\r\na relation to each other seen in no genus hitherto known, for the\r\narticular surfaces are wedge-shaped instead of being ovate; and instead\r\nof being side by side, they obliquely overlap, practically as in wading\r\nbirds like the Heron. I have never seen any Pterodactyle teeth so\r\nflattened and shaped like the end of a lancet; and from this character\r\nthe form was known between Mr. Fox and his friends as \"latidens.\" The\r\nname Ornithodesmus is as descriptive of the sternum as of the vertebral\r\ncolumn. The wing bones, as far as they are preserved, have the\r\nrelatively great strength in the fore limb which is found in many of the\r\nPterodactyles of the Cretaceous period, and are quite as large as the\r\nlargest from the Cambridge Greensand. In the Sussex species named _P.\r\nsagittirostris_ the lower jaw articulation was inches wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 67.  STERNUM OF _ORNITHODESMUS_\r\n\r\n  Showing the overlapping facets for the coracoid bones (shaded) behind\r\n  the median keel]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 68.  FRONT OF THE KEEL OF THE STERNUM OF\r\n  _ORNITHODESMUS LATIDENS_\r\n\r\n  Showing also the articulation for the coracoid bone]\r\n\r\nA few Pterodactyles' bones have been discovered in the Neocomian sands\r\nof England and Germany, and other larger bones occur in the Gault of\r\nFolkestone and the north of France; but never in such association as to\r\nthrow light on the aspect of the skeleton.\r\n\r\n\r\nORNITHOCHEIRUS\r\n\r\nWithin my own memory Pterodactyle remains were equally rare from the\r\nCambridge Greensand. The late Professor Owen in one of his public\r\nlectures produced the first few fragments received from Cambridge, and\r\nwith a knowledge which in its scientific method seemed to border on the\r\npower of creation, produced again the missing parts, so that the bones\r\ntold their story, which the work of waves and mineral changes in the\r\nrock had partly obliterated. Subsequently good fortune gave me the\r\nopportunity during ten years to help my University in the acquisition\r\nand arrangement of the finest collection of remains of these animals in\r\nEurope. Out of an area of a few acres, during a year or two, came the\r\nthousand bones of Ornithosaurs, mostly associated sets of remains, each\r\na part of a separate skeleton, described in my published catalogues, as\r\nwell as the best of those at York and in the British Museum and other\r\ncollections in London.\r\n\r\nThe deposit which yields them, named Cambridge Greensand, may or may not\r\nrepresent a long period of time in its single foot of thickness; but the\r\nabundance of fossils, obtained whenever the workmen were adequately\r\nremunerated for preserving them, would suggest that the Pterodactyles\r\nmight have lived like sea-birds or in colonies like the Penguins, if it\r\nwere not that the number of examples of each species found is always\r\nsmall, and the many variations of structure suggested rather that the\r\nindividuals represent the life of many lands. The collections of remains\r\nare mostly from villages in the immediate vicinity of Cambridge, such as\r\nChesterton, Huntingdon Road, Coldham Common, Haslingfield, Barton,\r\nShillington, Ditton, Granchester, Harston, Barrington, stretching south\r\nto Ashwell in Bedfordshire on the one hand, as well as further north by\r\nHorningsea into the fens. Each appears to be the associated bones of a\r\nsingle individual. The remains mostly belong to comparatively large\r\nanimals. Some were small, though none have been found so diminutive as\r\nthe smallest from the Solenhofen Slate. The largest specimens with long\r\njaws appear to have had the head measuring not more than eighteen inches\r\nin length, which is less than half the size of the great toothless\r\nPterodactyles from Kansas.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 69.  RESTORATION OF THE SKULL OF ORNITHOCHEIRUS\r\n\r\n  The parts left white are in the Geological Museum at Cambridge. The\r\n  shaded parts have not been found. The two holes are the eye and the\r\n  nostril (From the Cambridge Greensand)]\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge specimens manifestly belong to at least three genera.\r\nSomething may be said of the characters of the large animals which are\r\nincluded in the genus Ornithocheirus. These fossils have many points of\r\nstructure in common with the great American toothless forms which are of\r\nsimilar geological age. The skull is remarkable for having the back of\r\nthe head prolonged in a compressed median crest, which rose above the\r\nbrain case, and extended upward and over the neck vertebrae, so as to\r\nindicate a muscular power not otherwise shown in the group. For about\r\nthree inches behind the brain this wedge of bone rested on the vertebrae,\r\nand probably overlapped the first three neural arches in the neck.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of some interest is the expansion of the bone which\r\ncomes below the eye. In Birds this malar or cheek bone is a slender rod,\r\nbut in these Pterodactyles it is a vertical plate, which is blended with\r\nthe bone named the quadrate bone, which makes the articulation with the\r\nlower jaw in all oviparous animals.\r\n\r\nThe beak varies greatly in length and in form, though it is never quite\r\nso pointed as in the American genus, for there is always a little\r\ntruncation in front, when teeth are seen projecting forward from a\r\nposition somewhat above the palate; the snout is often massive and\r\nsometimes club-shaped. Except for these variations of shape in the\r\ncompressed snout, which is characterised by a ridge in the middle of the\r\npalate, and a corresponding groove in the lower jaw, and the teeth,\r\nthere is little to distinguish what is known of the skull in its largest\r\nEnglish Greensand fossils from the skull remains which abound in the\r\nChalk of Kansas.\r\n\r\nThis English genus Ornithocheirus, represented by a great number of\r\nspecies, had the neural arch of the neck bones expanded transversely\r\nover the body of the vertebra in a way that characterises many birds\r\nwith powerful necks, and is seen in a few Pterodactyles from Solenhofen.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to resist the conclusion that the neck vertebrae were\r\nnot usually more than twice to three times as long as those of the back,\r\nand it would appear that the caudal vertebrae in the English Cretaceous\r\ntypes were comparatively large, and about twice as long as the dorsal\r\nvertebrae. Unless there has been a singular succession of accidents in\r\nthe association of these vertebrae with the other remains, Ornithocheirus\r\nhad a tail of moderate length, formed of a few vertebrae as long as those\r\nof the neck, though more slender, quite unlike the tail in either the\r\nlong-tailed or short-tailed groups of Solenhofen Pterodactyles, and\r\nlonger than in the toothless Pterodactyles of America.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 70.  CERVICAL VERTEBRA, ORNITHOCHEIRUS\r\n\r\n  Under side, half natural size. (Cambridge Greensand)]\r\n\r\nThe singular articulation for the humerus at the truncated extremity of\r\nthe coracoid bone is a character of this group, as is the articulation\r\nof the scapulae with the neural arches of the dorsal vertebrae, at right\r\nangles to them (p. 115), instead of running over the ribs as in Birds\r\nand as in other Pterodactyles.\r\n\r\nThe smaller Pterodactyles have their jaws less compressed from side to\r\nside. The upper arm bone, the humerus, instead of being truncated at its\r\nlower end as in Ornithocheirus, is divided into two or three rounded\r\narticular surfaces. That for the radius, the bone which carries the\r\nwrist, is a distinct and oblique rounded facet, while the ulna has a\r\nrounded and pulley-like articulation on which the hand may rotate. These\r\ndifferences are probably associated with an absence of the remarkable\r\nmode of union of the scapulae with the dorsal vertebrae. But I have\r\nhesitated to give different names to these smaller genera because no\r\nexample of scapula has come under my notice which is not truncated at\r\nthe free end. I do not think this European type can be the Nyctodactylus\r\nof Professor Marsh, in which sutures appear to be persistent between the\r\nbodies of the vertebrae and their arches, because no examples have been\r\nfound at Cambridge with the neural arches separated, although the\r\nscapula is frequently separated from the coracoid in large animals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 71.  UPPER AND LOWER JAWS OF AN ENGLISH\r\n  PTERODACTYLE FROM THE CHALK, AS PRESERVED]\r\n\r\n\r\nORNITHOSTOMA\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 72.  THE PALATE OF THE ENGLISH TOOTHLESS\r\n  PTERODACTYLE, ORNITHOSTOMA]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 73.  TYPES OF THE AMERICAN TOOTHLESS PTERODACTYLE,\r\n  ORNITHOSTOMA\r\n\r\n  Named by Marsh, Pteranodon]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of all the English Pterodactyle remains is the\r\nsmall fragment of jaw figured by Sir Richard Owen in 1859, which is a\r\nlittle more than two inches long and an inch wide, distinguished by a\r\nconcave palate with smooth rounded margins to the jaws and a rounded\r\nridge to the beak. It is the only satisfactory fragment of the animal\r\nwhich has been figured, and indicates a genus of toothless\r\nPterodactyles, for which the name Ornithostoma was first used in 1871.\r\nAfter some years Professor Marsh found toothless Pterodactyles in\r\nKansas, and indicated several species. There are remains to the number\r\nof six hundred specimens of these American animals in the Yale Museum\r\nalone; but very little was known of them till Professor Williston, of\r\nLawrence, in Kansas, described the specimens from the Kansas University\r\nMuseum, when it became evident that the bones of the skeleton are mostly\r\nformed on the same plan as those of the Cambridge Greensand genus,\r\nOrnithocheirus. They are not quite identical. Professor Williston adopts\r\nfor them the name Ornithostoma, in preference to Pteranodon which Marsh\r\nhad suggested. Both animals have the dagger-shaped form of jaw, with\r\ncorresponding height and breadth of the palate. The same flattened sides\r\nto the snout, converging upwards to a rounded ridge, the same compressed\r\nrounded margin to the jaw, which represents the border in which teeth\r\nare usually implanted, and in both the palate has the same smooth\r\ncharacter forming a single wide concave channel. Years previously I had\r\nthe pleasure of showing to Professor Marsh the remarkable characters of\r\nthe jaw, shoulder-girdle bones, and scapulae in the Greensand\r\nPterodactyles while the American fossils were still undiscovered. I\r\nsubsequently made the restoration of the shoulder-girdle (p. 115).\r\nProfessor Williston states to me that the shoulder-girdle bones in\r\nAmerican examples of Ornithostoma have a close resemblance to those of\r\nOrnithocheirus figured in 1891, as is evident from remains now shown in\r\nthe British Museum. It appears that the Kansas bones are almost\r\ninvariably crushed flat, so that their articular ends are distorted. The\r\nneck vertebrae are relatively stout as in Ornithocheirus. The hip-girdle\r\nof the American Ornithostoma can be closely paralleled in some English\r\nspecimens of Ornithocheirus, though each prepubic bone is triangular in\r\nthe American fossils as in _P. rhamphastinus_. They are united into a\r\ntransverse bar as in Rhamphorhynchus, unknown in the English fossils.\r\nThe femur has the same shape as in Ornithocheirus; and the long tibia\r\nterminates in a pulley. There is no fibula. The sternum in both has a\r\nmanubrium, or thick keel mass, prolonged in front of its articular\r\nfacets for the coracoid bones, which are well separated from each other.\r\nFour ribs articulate with its straight sides. The animal has four toes\r\nand the fifth is rudimentary; there are no claws to the first and\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 74.  RESTORATION OF THE SKELETON OF _ORNITHOSTOMA\r\n  INGENS_ (MARSH)\r\n\r\n  From the Niobrara Cretaceous of Western Kansas. Made by Professor\r\n  Williston. The original has a spread of wing of about 19 feet 4\r\n  inches. Fragments of larger individuals are preserved at Munich]\r\n\r\nIn the restoration which Professor Williston has made the wing\r\nmetacarpal is long, and in the shortest specimen measures 1 foot 7\r\ninches, and in the longest 1 foot 8 inches. This is exactly equal to the\r\nlength of the first phalange of the wing finger. The second wing finger\r\nbone is 3 inches shorter, the third is little more than half the length\r\nof the first, while the fourth is only 6-3/4 inches long, showing a\r\nrapid shortening of the bones, a condition which may have characterised\r\nall the Cretaceous Pterodactyles. The short humerus, about 1 foot long,\r\nand the fore-arm, which is scarcely longer, are also characteristic\r\nproportions of Ornithostoma or Pteranodon, as known from the American\r\nspecimens. Professor Williston gives no details of the remarkable tail,\r\nbeyond saying that the tail is small and short, and that the vertebrae\r\nare flat at the ends, without transverse processes. In the restoration\r\nthe tail is shorter than in the short-tailed species from the\r\nLithographic Slate, and unlike the tail in Ornithocheirus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the succession of Pterodactyles in geological time. Their\r\nhistory is like that of the human race. In the most ancient nations\r\nman's life comes upon us already fully organised. The Pterodactyles\r\nbegin, so far as isolated bones are concerned, in the Rhaetic strata;\r\nperhaps in the Muschelkalk or middle division of the Trias. And from the\r\nbeginning of the Secondary time they live on with but little diversity\r\nin important and characteristic structures, and so far as habit goes,\r\nthe great Pterodactyles of the Upper Chalk of England cannot be said to\r\nbe more highly organised than the earlier stiff-tailed genera of the\r\nLias or the Oolites. There is nothing like evolution. No modification\r\nsuch as that which derives the one-toed horse or the two-toed ox from\r\nancestors with a larger number of digits. On the other hand, there is\r\nlittle, if any, evidence of degeneration. The later Pterodactyles do not\r\nappear to have lost much, although the tail in some of the Solenhofen\r\ngenera may be degenerate when compared with the long tail of\r\nDimorphodon; but the short-tailed types are found side by side with the\r\nlong-tailed Rhamphorhynchus. The absence of teeth may be regarded as\r\ndegeneration, for they have presumably become lost, in the same way that\r\nBirds now existing have lost the teeth which characterised the fossil\r\nbirds--Ichthyornis of the American Greensand, and Archaeopteryx of the\r\nUpper Oolites of Bavaria. But just as some of the earlier Pterodactyles\r\nhave no teeth at the extremity of the jaw, such as Dorygnathus and\r\nRhamphorhynchus, so the loss of teeth may have extended backward till\r\nthe jaws became toothless. The specimens hitherto known give no evidence\r\nof such a change being in progress. But just as the division of Mammals\r\ntermed Edentata usually wants only the teeth which characterise the\r\nfront of the jaw, yet others, like the Great Ant-eater of South America\r\nnamed Myrmecophaga, have the jaws as free from teeth as the toothless\r\nPterodactyles or living Birds, and show that in that order the teeth\r\nhave no value in separating these animals into subordinate groups any\r\nmore than they have among the Monotremata, where one type has teeth and\r\nthe other is toothless.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives a summary of the Geological History and\r\nsuccession in the Secondary Rocks of the principal genera of Flying\r\nReptiles.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+----------------------------------------------\r\n                         |             NAMES OF THE GENERA.\r\n  GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS. +-----------------------+----------------------\r\n                         | British and European. | North American.\r\n  -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n  Upper Chalk            |                       |} Ornithostoma\r\n                         |                       |}     (_Pteranodon_)\r\n  Lower Chalk            |} Ornithocheirus       |} Nyctodactylus\r\n  Upper Greensand        |}   |  Ornithostoma    |\r\n  Gault                  |    |                  |\r\n  -----------------------+    |                  |\r\n  Lower Greensand        |    |                  |\r\n  Wealden                | Ornithodesmus         |\r\n  Purbeck                | Doratorhynchus        |\r\n  -----------------------+                       |\r\n  Portland               |{ Pterodactylus        |\r\n                         |{ Ptenodracon          |\r\n  Kimeridge Clay and     |{ Cycnorhamphus        |\r\n    Solenhofen Slate     |{ Diopecephalus        |\r\n                         |{ Rhamphorhynchus      |\r\n  Coralline Oolite       |{ Scaphognathus        |\r\n                         |                       |\r\n  Oxford Clay            |                       |\r\n  -----------------------+                       |\r\n  Great Oolite and       |                       |\r\n    Stonesfield Slate    | Rhamphocephalus       |\r\n                         |                       |\r\n  Inferior Oolite        |                       |\r\n  -----------------------+                       |\r\n  Upper Lias             |{ Campylognathus       |\r\n                         |{ Dorygnathus          |\r\n  Lower Lias             |  Dimorphodon          |\r\n  -----------------------+                       |\r\n  Rhaetic                 |  bones                |\r\n                         |                       |\r\n  Muschelkalk            |  ? bones              |\r\n  -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE ORNITHOSAURIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an attempt is made to determine the place in nature of an extinct\r\ngroup of animals and the relation to each other of the different types\r\nincluded within its limits, so as to express those facts in a\r\nclassification, attention is directed in the first place to characters\r\nwhich are constant, and persist through the whole of its constituent\r\ngenera. We endeavour to find the structural parts of the skeleton which\r\nare not affected by variation in the dentition, or the proportions of\r\nthe extremities, or length of the tail, which may define families or\r\ngenera, or species.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that while in many ways the Ornithosaurian\r\nanimals are like Birds, they have also important resemblances to\r\nReptiles. They are often named Pterosauria. The wing finger gives a\r\ndistinctive character which is found in neither one class of existing\r\nanimals nor the other, and is common to all the Pterodactyles at present\r\nknown. They have been named Ornithosauria as a distinct minor division\r\nof back-boned animals, which may be regarded as neither Reptiles nor\r\nBirds in the sense in which those terms are used to define a Lizard or\r\nOstrich among animals which still exist. It is not so much that they\r\nmark a transition from Reptile to Bird, as that they are a group which\r\nis parallel to Birds, and more manifestly holds an intermediate place\r\nthan Birds do between Reptiles and Mammals. In plan of structure Bird\r\nand Reptile have more in common than was at one time suspected. The late\r\nProfessor Huxley went so far as to generalise on those coincidences in\r\nparts of the skeleton, and united Birds and Reptiles into one group,\r\nwhich he named Sauropsida, to express the coincidences of structure\r\nbetween the Lizard and the Bird tribes. The idea is of more value than\r\nthe term in which it is expressed, because Reptiles are not, as we have\r\nseen, a group of animals which can be defined by any set of characters\r\nas comprehensive as those which express the distinctive features of\r\nBirds. From the anatomist's point of view Birds are a smaller group, and\r\nwhile some Reptiles have affinity with them, it is rather the extinct\r\nthan the living groups which indicate that relation. Other Reptiles have\r\naffinities of a more marked kind with Mammals, and there are points in\r\nthe Ornithosaurian skeleton which are distinctly Mammalian. So that when\r\nthe Monotreme Mammals are united with South African reptiles known as\r\nTheriodontia, which resemble them, in a group termed Theropsida to\r\nexpress their mammalian resemblances, it is evident that there is no one\r\ncontinuous chain of life or gradation in complexity of structure of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nWe have to determine whether the Ornithosauria incline towards the\r\nSauropsidan or Bird-Reptile alliance, or to the Mammal-Reptile or\r\nTheropsidan alliance. There can be no doubt that the predominant\r\ntendency is to the former, with a minor affinity towards the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Ornithosauria are one of a series of groups of animals, living and\r\nextinct, which have been combined in an alliance named the\r\nOrnithomorpha. That group includes at least five great divisions of\r\nanimals, which circle about birds, known as Ornithosauria, Crocodilia,\r\nSaurischia, Aves, Ornithischia, and Aristosuchia. Their relations to\r\neach other are not evident in an enumeration, but may be shown in some\r\ndegree in a diagram (see p. 190).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORNITHOMORPHA\r\n\r\nThe Ornithomorpha arranged in this way show that the three middle\r\ngroups--carnivorous Saurischia, Aristosuchia, herbivorous\r\nOrnithischia--which are usually united as Dinosauria, intervene between\r\nBirds and Ornithosaurs; and that the Crocodilia and Ornithosauria are\r\nparallel groups which are connected with Birds, by the group of\r\nDinosaurs, which resembles Birds most closely.\r\n\r\nThe Ornithomorpha is only one of a series of large natural groups of\r\nanimals into which living and extinct terrestrial vertebrata may be\r\narranged. And the succeeding diagram may contribute to make evident the\r\nrelations of Ornithosauria to the other terrestrial vertebrata (see p.\r\n191).\r\n\r\nHerein it is seen that while the Ornithomorpha approach towards Mammalia\r\nthrough the Ornithosauria, and less distinctly through the Crocodilia,\r\nthey approach more directly to the Sauromorpha, through the Plesiosaurs\r\nand Hatteria; while that group also approaches more directly to the\r\nMammals through the Plesiosaurs and Anomodonts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DIAGRAM OF THE AFFINITIES OF THE ORDERS OF ANIMALS\r\n  COMPRISED IN THE ORNITHOMORPHA.\r\n\r\n  After a diagram in the _Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\r\n  Society_, 1892.]\r\n\r\nThe Aristosuchia is imperfectly known, and therefore to some extent a\r\nprovisional group. It is a small group of animals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING THE RELATIONS OF THE ORNITHOMORPHA\r\n  TO THE CHIEF LARGE GROUPS OF TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATA, AND THEIR\r\n  AFFINITIES WITH EACH OTHER.\r\n\r\n  After a diagram in the _Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\r\n  Society_, 1892.]\r\n\r\nCordylomorpha are Ichthyosaurs and the Labyrinthodont group.\r\nHerpetomorpha include Lacertilia, Homoeosauria, Dolichosauria,\r\nChameleonoidea, Ophidia, Pythonomorpha.\r\n\r\nThe Sauromorpha comprises the groups of extinct and living Reptiles\r\nnamed Chelonia, Rhynchocephala, Sauropterygia, Anomodontia, Nothosauria,\r\nand Protorosauria. These details may help to explain the place which has\r\nbeen given to the Ornithosauria in the classification of animals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 75.  COMPARISON OF SIX GENERA\r\n\r\n  The skulls are seen on the left side in the order of the names below\r\n  them]\r\n\r\nTurning to the Pterodactyles themselves, Von Meyer divided them\r\nnaturally into short-tailed and long-tailed. The short-tailed indicated\r\nby the name Pterodactylus he further divided into long-nosed and\r\nshort-nosed. The short-nosed genus has since been named Ptenodracon\r\n(Fig. 59, p. 167). The long-tailed group was divided into two types--the\r\nRhamphorhynchus of the Solenhofen Slate (Fig. 56, p. 161) and the\r\nEnglish form now known as Dimorphodon (Fig. 52, p. 150), which had been\r\ndescribed from the Lias.\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous Pterodactyles form a distinct family. So that, believing\r\nthe tail to have been short in that group (Fig. 58), there are two\r\nlong-tailed as well as two short-tailed families, which were defined\r\nfrom their typical genera Pterodactylus, Ornithocheirus,\r\nRhamphorhynchus, and Dimorphodon.\r\n\r\nThe differences in structure which these animals present are, first: the\r\nbig-headed forms from the Lias like Dimorphodon, agree with the\r\nRhamphorhynchus type from Solenhofen in having a vacuity in the skull\r\ndefined by bone, placed between the orbit of the eye and the nostril.\r\nWith those characters are correlated the comparatively short bones which\r\ncorrespond to the back of the hand termed metacarpals, and the tail is\r\nlong, and stiffened down its length with ossified tendons. These\r\ncharacters separate Ornithosaurs with long tails from those with short\r\ntails.\r\n\r\nThe short-tailed types represented by Pterodactylus and Ornithocheirus\r\nhave no distinct antorbital vacuity in the skull defined by bone. The\r\nmetacarpal bones of the middle hand are exceptionally elongated, and the\r\ntail, which was flexible in both, appears to have been short. These\r\ndifferences in the skeleton warrant a primary division of flying\r\nreptiles into two principal groups.\r\n\r\nThe short-tailed group, which was recognised by De Blainville as\r\nintermediate between Birds and Reptiles, may take the name\r\nPterodactylia, which he suggested as a convenient, distinctive name. It\r\nmay probably be inconvenient to enlarge its significance to comprise not\r\nonly the true Pterodactyles originally defined as Pterosauria, but the\r\nnewer Ornithostoma and Ornithocheirus which have been grouped as\r\nOrnithocheiroidea.\r\n\r\nThe second order, in which the wing membrane appears to have had a much\r\ngreater extent, in being carried down the hind limbs, where the\r\noutermost digit and metatarsal are modified for its support, has been\r\nnamed Pterodermata, to include the types which are arranged around\r\nRhamphorhynchus and Dimorphodon.\r\n\r\nBoth these principal groups admit of subdivision by many characters in\r\nthe skeleton, the most remarkable of which is afforded by the pair of\r\nbones carried in front of the pubes, and termed prepubic bones. In the\r\nPterodactyle family the bones in front of the pubes are always separate\r\nfrom each other, always directed forward, and have a peculiar fan-shaped\r\nform with concave sides like the bone which holds a similar position in\r\na Crocodile. In the Ornithocheirus family the prepubic bones appear to\r\nhave been originally triangular, but were afterwards united so as to\r\nform a strong continuous bar which extends transversely across the\r\nabdomen in advance of the pubic bones. This at least is the distinctive\r\ncharacter in the genus Ornithostoma according to Professor Williston,\r\nwhich in many ways closely resembles Ornithocheirus.\r\n\r\nThe two families in the long-tailed order named Pterodermata are\r\nseparated from each other by a similar difference in their prepubic\r\nbones. In Dimorphodon those bones are separate from each other, and\r\nremain distinct through life, meeting in the middle line of the body in\r\na wide plate. On the other hand, in Rhamphorhynchus the prepubic bones,\r\nwhich are at first triangular and always slender, become blended\r\ntogether into a slight transverse bar, which only differs from that\r\nattributed to Ornithostoma in its more slender bow-shaped form.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 76.  LEFT SIDE OF PELVIS OF ORNITHOSTOMA\r\n  (After Williston)]\r\n\r\nThus if other characters of the skeleton are ignored and a\r\nclassification based upon the structure of the pelvis and prepubic\r\nbones, there would be some ground for associating the long-tailed\r\nRhamphorhynchus from the Upper Oolites which is losing the teeth in the\r\nfront of its jaw with the Cretaceous Ornithostoma, which has the teeth\r\ncompletely wanting; while the long-tailed Dimorphodon would come into\r\ncloser association with the short-tailed Pterodactylus. The drum-stick\r\nbone or tibia in Dimorphodon, with its slender fibula, like that of a\r\nBird, also resembles a Bird in the rounded and pulley-shaped terminal\r\nend which makes the joint corresponding to the middle of the ankle bones\r\nin man. The same condition of a terminal pulley joint is found in the\r\nCretaceous Pterodactyles. But in the true Pterodactyles and in\r\nRhamphorhynchus there usually is no pulley-shaped termination to the\r\nlower end of the drum-stick, for the tarsal bones remain separate from\r\neach other, and form two rows of ossifications, showing the same\r\ndifferences as separate Dinosaurs into the divisions which have been\r\nreferred to, from their Bird-like pelvis and tibio-tarsus, as\r\nOrnithischia in the one case, and Saurischia in the other from their\r\nbones being more like those of living Lizards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nFAMILY RELATIONS OF PTERODACTYLES TO ANIMALS WHICH LIVED WITH THEM\r\n\r\n\r\nEnough has been said of the general structure of Pterodactyles and the\r\nchief forms which they assumed while the Secondary rocks were\r\naccumulating, to convey a clear idea of their relations to the types of\r\nvertebrate animals which still survive on the earth. We may be unable to\r\nexplain the reasons for their existence, and for their departure from\r\nthe plan of organisation of Reptiles and Birds. But the evidence has not\r\nbeen exhausted which may elucidate their existence. Sometimes, in\r\nproblems of this kind, which involve comparison of the details of the\r\nskeleton in different animals, it is convenient to imagine the\r\npossibility of changes and transitions which are not yet supported by\r\nthe discovery of fossil remains. If, for example, the Pterodactyle be\r\nconceived of as divested of the wing finger, which is its most\r\ndistinctive character, or that finger is supposed to be replaced by an\r\nordinary digit, like the three-clawed digits of the hand which we have\r\nregarded as applied to the ground, where, it may be asked, would the\r\nanimal type be found which approximates most closely to a Pterodactyle\r\nwhich had been thus modified? There are two possible replies to such a\r\nquestion, suggested by the form of the foot. For the old Bird\r\nArchaeopteryx has three such clawed digits, but no wing finger. And some\r\nDinosaurs also have the hand with three digits terminating in claws,\r\nwhich are quite comparable to the clawed digits of Pterodactyles.\r\n\r\nThe truth expressed in the saying that no man by taking thought can add\r\na cubit to his stature is of universal application in the animal world,\r\nin relation to the result upon the skeleton of the exercise of a\r\nfunction by the individual. Yet such is the relation in proportions of\r\nthe different parts of the animal to the work which it performs, so\r\nmarked is the evidence that growth has extended in direct relation to\r\nuse of organs and active life, and that structures have become dwarfed\r\nfrom overwork, or have wasted away from disuse--seen throughout all\r\nvertebrate animals, that we may fairly attribute to the wing finger some\r\ncorrelated influence upon the proportions of the animal, as a\r\nconsequence of the dependence of the entire economy upon each of its\r\nparts. Therefore if an allied animal did not possess a wing finger, and\r\ndid not fly, it might not have developed the lightness of bone, or the\r\nlength of limb which Pterodactyles possess.\r\n\r\nThe mere expansion of the parachute membrane seen in so-called flying\r\nanimals, both Mammals and Reptiles, which are devoid of wings, is\r\nabsolutely without effect in modifying the skeleton. But when in the Bat\r\na wing structure is met with which may be compared to a gigantic\r\nextension of the web foot of the so-called Flying Frog, the bones of the\r\nfingers and the back of the hand elongate and extend under the stimulus\r\nof the function of flight in the same way as the legs elongate in the\r\nmore active hoofed animals, with the function of running. Therefore it\r\nis not improbable that the limbs shared to some extent in growth under\r\nstimulus of exercise which developed the wing finger. And if an animal\r\ncan be found among fossils so far allied as to indicate a possible\r\nrepresentative of the race from which these Flying Dragons arose, it\r\nmight be expected to be at least shorter legged, and possibly more\r\ndistinctly Reptilian in the bones of the shoulder-girdle which support\r\nthe muscles used in flight. It may readily be understood that the kinds\r\nof life which were most nearly allied to Pterodactyles are likely to\r\nhave existed upon the earth with them, and that flight was only one of\r\nthe modes of progression which became developed in relation to their\r\nconditions of existence. The principal assemblage of terrestrial animals\r\navailable for such comparison is the Dinosauria. They may differ from\r\nPterodactyles as widely as the Insectivora among Mammals differ from\r\nBats, but not in a more marked way. Comparisons will show that there are\r\nresemblances between the two extinct groups which appeal to both reason\r\nand imagination.\r\n\r\nDinosaurs are conveniently divided by characters of the pelvis first\r\ninto the order Saurischia, which includes the carnivorous Megalosaurus\r\nand the Cetiosaurus, with the pelvis on the Reptile plan; and secondly\r\nthe order Ornithischia, represented by Iguanodon, with the pelvis on the\r\nBird plan. It may be only a coincidence, but nevertheless an interesting\r\none, that the characters of those two great groups of reptiles, which\r\nalso extend throughout the Secondary rocks, are to some extent\r\nparalleled in parts of the skeleton of the two divisions of\r\nPterodactyles. This may be illustrated by reference to the skull,\r\npelvis, hind limb, and the pneumatic condition of the bones.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 77.  COMPARISON OF THE SKULL OF THE DINOSAUR\r\n  ANCHISAURUS WITH THE ORNITHOSAUR DIMORPHODON]\r\n\r\nThe Saurischian Dinosauria have an antorbital vacuity in the side of the\r\nskull between the nasal opening and the eye, as in the long-tailed\r\nOrnithosaurs named Pterodermata. In some of the older genera of these\r\ncarnivorous Dinosaurs of the Trias, the lateral vacuities of the head\r\nare as large as in Dimorphodon. But in some at least of the Iguanodont,\r\nor Ornithischian Dinosaurs, there is no antorbital vacuity, and the side\r\nof the face in that respect resembles the short-tailed Pterodactylia.\r\nThe skull of a carnivorous Dinosaur possesses teeth which, though easily\r\ndistinguished from those of Pterodactyles, can be best compared with\r\nthem. The most striking difference is in the fact that in the Dinosaur\r\nthe nostrils are nearly terminal, while in the Pterodactyle they are\r\nremoved some distance backward. This result is brought about by growth\r\ntaking place, in the one case at the front margin of the maxillary bone\r\nso as to carry the nostril forward, and in the other case at the back\r\nmargin of the premaxillary bone. Thus an elongated part of the jaw is\r\nextended in front of the nostril. Hence there is a different proportion\r\nbetween the premaxillary and maxillary bones in the two groups of\r\nanimals, which corresponds to the presence of a beak in a bird, and its\r\nabsence in living reptiles. It is not known whether the extremity of the\r\nPterodactyle's beak is a single bone, the intermaxillary bone, such as\r\nforms the corresponding toothless part of the jaw in the South African\r\nreptile Dicynodon, or whether it is made by the pair of bones called\r\npremaxillaries which form the extremity of the jaw in most Dinosaurs.\r\nToo much importance may perhaps be attached to such differences which\r\nare partly hypothetical, because the extinct Ichthyosaurus, which has an\r\nexceptionally long snout, has the two premaxillary bones elongated so as\r\nto extend backward to the nostrils. A similar elongation of those bones\r\nis seen in Porpoises, which also have a long snout; and the bones are\r\ncarried back from the front of the head to the nostrils, which are\r\nsometimes known as blowholes. But the Porpoise has those premaxillary\r\nbones not so much in advance of the bones which carry teeth named\r\nmaxillary, as placed in the interspace between them. The nostrils,\r\nhowever, are not limited to the extremity of the head in all Dinosaurs.\r\nIf this region of the beak in Dimorphodon be compared with the\r\ncorresponding part of a Dinosaur from the Permian rocks, or Trias, the\r\nrelation of the nostril to the bones forming the beak may be better\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 78.  COMPARISON OF THE SKULL OF THE DINOSAUR\r\n  ORNITHOSUCHUS WITH THE ORNITHOSAUR DIMORPHODON]\r\n\r\nIn the sandstone of Elgin, usually named Trias, a small Dinosaur is\r\nfound, which has been named Ornithosuchus, from the resemblance of its\r\nhead to that of a Bird. Seen from above, the head has a remarkable\r\nresemblance to the condition in Rhamphorhynchus, in the sharp-pointed\r\nbeak and positions of the orbits and other openings. In side view the\r\norbits have the triangular form seen in Dimorphodon, and the preorbital\r\nvacuities are large, as in that genus, while the lateral nostrils, which\r\nare smaller, are further forward in the Dinosaur. The differences from\r\nDimorphodon are in the articulation for the jaw being carried a little\r\nbackward, instead of being vertical as in the Pterodactyle, and the bone\r\nin front of the nose is smaller. Notwithstanding probable differences\r\nin the palate, the approximation, which extends to the Crocodile-like\r\nvacuity in the lower jaw, is such that by slight modification in the\r\nskull the differences would be substantially obliterated by which the\r\nskull of such an Ornithosaur is technically distinguished from such a\r\nDinosaur.\r\n\r\nThe back of the skull is clearly seen in the Whitby Pterodactyle, and\r\nits structure is similar to the corresponding part of such Dinosaurs as\r\nAnchisaurus or Atlantosaurus, without the resemblance quite amounting to\r\nidentity, but still far closer than is the resemblance between the same\r\nregion in the heads of Crocodiles, Lizards, Serpents, Chelonians. Few of\r\nthese fossil Dinosaur skulls are available for comparison, and those\r\ndiffer among themselves. The coincidences rather suggest a close\r\ncollateral relation than prove the elaboration of one type from the\r\nother. They may have had a common ancestor.\r\n\r\nThe Trias rocks near Stuttgart have yielded Dinosaurs as unlike\r\nPterodactyles as could be imagined, resembling heavily armoured\r\nCrocodiles, in such types as the genus Belodon. Its jaws are compressed\r\nfrom side to side, as in many Pterodactyles, and the nostrils are at\r\nleast as far backward as in Rhamphorhynchus. Belodon has preorbital\r\nvacuities and postorbital vacuities, but the orbit of the eye is never\r\nlarge, as in Pterodactyles. It might not be worth while dwelling on such\r\npoints in the skull if it were not that the pelvis in Belodon is a basin\r\nformed by the blending of the expanded plates of the ischium and the\r\npubis, into a sheet of bone which more nearly resembles the same region\r\nin Pterodactyles than does the ischio-pubic region in other Dinosaurian\r\nanimals like Cetiosaurus.\r\n\r\nThe backbone in a few Dinosaurs is suggestive of Pterodactyles. In such\r\ngenera as have been named Coelurus and Calamospondylus, in which the\r\nskeleton is only partially known, the neck vertebrae become elongated, so\r\nas to compare with the long-necked Pterodactyles. The cervical rib is\r\noften very similar to that type, and blended with the vertebra, as in\r\nPterodactyles and Birds. The early dorsal vertebrae of Pterodactyles\r\nmight almost be mistaken for those of Dinosaurs. The tail vertebrae of a\r\nPterodactyle are usually longer than in long-tailed Dinosauria.\r\n\r\nIn the limbs and the bony girdles which support them there is more\r\nresemblance between Pterodactyles and Dinosaurs than might have been\r\nanticipated, considering their manifest differences in habit. Thus all\r\nDinosaurs have the hip bone named ilium prolonged in front of the\r\narticulation for the femur as well as behind it, almost exactly as in\r\nPterodactyles and Birds (see p. 95). There is some difference in the\r\npubis and ischium which is more conspicuous in form than in direction of\r\nthe bones. There is a Pterodactyle imperfectly preserved, named\r\n_Pterodactylus dubius_, in which the ischium is directed backward and\r\nthe pubis downward, and the bones unite below the acetabular cavity for\r\nthe head of the femur to work in, but do not appear to be otherwise\r\nconnected. In Rhamphorhynchus the connexion between these two thickened\r\nbars is made by a thin plate of bone. In such a Dinosaur as the American\r\ncarnivorous Ceratosaurus the two bars of the pubis and ischium remain\r\nseparate and diverging, and there is no film of bone extending over the\r\ninterspace between them. The development of such a bony condition would\r\nmake a close approximation between the Ornithosaurian pelvis and that\r\nof those Dinosaurs which closely resemble Pterodactyles in skull and\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 79.  LEFT SIDE OF PELVIS\r\n  A Pterodactyle is shown between a carnivorous Dinosaur above and a\r\n  herbivorous Dinosaur below]\r\n\r\nAnother pelvic character of some interest is the blending of the pubis\r\nand ischium of the right and left sides in the middle line of the body.\r\nThere are some genera of Dinosaurs like the English Aristosuchus from\r\nthe Weald, and the American genera Coelurus, Ceratosaurus, and others,\r\nin which the pubic bones, instead of uniting at their extremities, are\r\npinched together from side to side, and unite down the lower part of\r\ntheir length, terminating in an expanded end like a shoe, which is seen\r\nto be a separate ossification, and probably formed by a pair of\r\nossifications joined in the median line. This small bone, which is below\r\nthe pubes, and in these animals becomes blended with them, we may regard\r\nas a pair of prepubic bones like those of Pterodactyles and Crocodiles,\r\nexcept that they have lost the stalk-like portions, which in those\r\nanimals are developed to compensate for the diminished length of the\r\npubic bones. The prepubic bones may also be developed in Iguanodon, in\r\nwhich a pair of bones of similar form remains throughout life in advance\r\nof the pubes, as in Pterodactyles. In those Dinosauria with the\r\nBird-like type of pelvis the pubic bone is exceptionally developed,\r\nsending one process backward and another process forward, so that there\r\nis a great gap between these diverging limbs to the bone. In the region\r\nbehind the sternum to which the ribs were attached, and in front of the\r\npelvis, is a pair of bones in Iguanodon shaped like the prepubic bones\r\nof Dimorphodon. They have sometimes been interpreted as a hinder part of\r\nthe sternum, but may more probably be regarded as a pair of prepubic\r\nbones articulating each with the anterior process of the pubis (see Fig.\r\n80). The small bones found at the extremities of the pubes in such\r\ncarnivorous Dinosaurs as Aristosuchus are blended by bony union with the\r\npubes. The bones in Iguanodon are placed behind the sternal region\r\nwithout any attachment for sternal ribs, and the expanded processes\r\nconverge forwards from the stalk and unite exactly like the prepubic\r\nbones of Ornithosaurs. While this character, on the one hand, may link\r\nPterodactyles with the Dinosaurs, on the other hand it may be a link\r\nbetween both those groups and the Crocodiles, in which the front pair of\r\nbones of the pelvis has also appeared to be representative of the\r\nprepubic bones of Flying Reptiles (see Fig. 32, p. 98).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 80.  DIAGRAM OF THE PELVIS SEEN FROM BELOW IN AN\r\n  ORNITHOSAUR AND A DINOSAUR]\r\n\r\nThe resemblances between Pterodactyles and Dinosaurs in the hind limb\r\nare not of less interest, though it is rather in the older Pterodactyles\r\nsuch as Dimorphodon, Pterodactylus, and Rhamphorhynchus that the\r\nresemblance is closest with the slender carnivorous Dinosaurs. They\r\nnever have the head of the thigh bone, femur, separated from its shaft\r\nby a constricted neck, as in the Pterodactyles from the Chalk. In many\r\nways the thigh bone of Dinosaurs tends towards being Avian; while that\r\nof Pterodactyles inclines towards being Mammalian, but with a tendency\r\nto be Bird-like in the older types, and to be Mammal-like in the most\r\nrecent representatives of the group in the Chalk.\r\n\r\nThe bones of the leg in Ornithosaurs, known as tibia and fibula, are\r\nremarkable for the circumstance first that they resemble Birds in the\r\nfibula being slender and only developed in its upper part towards the\r\nfemur, and secondly that in a genus like Dimorphodon this drum-stick\r\nbone has the two upper bones of the ankle blended with the tibia, so as\r\nto form a rounded pulley joint which is indistinguishable from that of a\r\nBird (see p. 102). There is a large number of Dinosaurs in which this\r\nremarkable distinctive character of Birds is also found. Only, Dinosaurs\r\nlike Iguanodon, for instance, have the slender fibula as long as the\r\ntibia, and contributing to unite with the separate ankle bones of the\r\nsimilarly rounded pulley at the lower end. There are no Birds in which\r\nthe tarsal bones remain separated and distinct throughout life. But in\r\nPterodactylus from Solenhofen, as in a number of Dinosaurs, especially\r\nthe carnivorous genera, the bones of the tarsus remain distinct\r\nthroughout life, and never acquired such forms as would have enabled the\r\nankle bone, termed astragalus, to embrace the extremity of the tibia, as\r\nit does in Iguanodon. Thus the resemblance of the Ornithosaur drum-stick\r\nis almost as close to Dinosaurs as to Birds.\r\n\r\nThere is great similarity between Dinosaurs and Pterodactyles seen in\r\nthe region of the instep, known as the metatarsus. These bones are\r\nusually four in number, parallel to each other, and similar in form.\r\nThey are commonly longer than in Dinosaurs; but among some of the\r\ncarnivorous Dinosaurs their length approximates to that seen in\r\nPterodactyles. In neither group are the bones blended together by bony\r\nunion, while they are always united in Birds, as in Oxen and similar\r\neven-hoofed mammals. Dinosaurs agree with Pterodactyles in maintaining\r\nthe metatarsal bones separate, but they differ from them and agree with\r\nBirds frequently, in having the number of metatarsal bones reduced to\r\nthree, as in Iguanodon, though Dinosaurs often have as many as five\r\ndigits developed.\r\n\r\nThe toe bones, the phalanges of these digits of the hind limb, are\r\nusually longer in Pterodactyles than in Dinosaurs, but they resemble\r\ncarnivorous Dinosaurs in the forms of their sharp terminal bones for the\r\nclaws, which are similarly compressed from side to side.\r\n\r\nSo diverse are the functions of the fore limb in Dinosaurs and\r\nPterodactyles, and so remarkably does the length of the metacarpal\r\nregion of the back of the hand vary in the long-tailed and short-tailed\r\nOrnithosaurs, that there is necessarily a less close correspondence in\r\nthat region of the skeleton between these two groups of animals; for the\r\nPterodactyle fore limb is modified in relation to a function which can\r\nonly be paralleled among Birds and Bats; and yet neither of those groups\r\nof animals approximates closely in this region of the skeleton to the\r\nFlying Reptile. Under all the modifications of structure which may be\r\nattributed to differences of function, some resemblance to Dinosaurs may\r\nbe detected, which is best evident in the upper arm bone, humerus; is\r\nslight in the fore-arm bones, ulna and radius; and becomes lost towards\r\nthe extremity of the limb.\r\n\r\nIf the tendency of the thigh bone to resemble a Mammalian type of femur\r\n(p. 100) is a fundamental, deep-seated character of the skeleton, it\r\nmight be anticipated that a trace of Mammalian character would also be\r\nfound in the humerus. For what the character is worth, the head of the\r\nhumerus does show a closer approximation to a Monotreme Mammal than is\r\nseen in Birds, and is to some extent paralleled in those South African\r\nreptiles which approximate to Mammals most closely. Not the least\r\nremarkable of the many astonishing resemblances of these light aerial\r\ncreatures to the more heavy bodied Dinosaurs is the circumstance that\r\nthe humerus in both groups makes a not dissimilar approach to that of\r\ncertain Mammals.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations may be accepted as demonstrating a relationship\r\nbetween the Ornithosaurs and Dinosaurs now compared, which can only be\r\nexplained as results of influence of a common parentage upon the forms\r\nof the bones. But more interesting than resemblances of that kind is the\r\nsimilarity that may be traced in the way in which air is introduced into\r\ncavities in the bones in both groups. In some of the imperfectly known\r\nDinosaurs, like Aristosuchus, Coelurus, and Thecospondylus, the bone\r\ntexture is as thin as in Pterodactyles, and the vertebrae are excavated\r\nby pneumatic cavities, which are amazing in size when compared with the\r\ncorresponding structures in birds, for the vertebra is often hollowed\r\nout so that nothing remains but a thin external film like paper for its\r\nthickness. In the Dinosaurian genus Coelurus this condition is as well\r\nmarked in the tail and back as it is in the neck. The essential\r\ndifference from Birds appears to be that in the larger carnivorous\r\nDinosaurs the pneumatic condition of the bones is confined to the\r\nvertebral column; while Birds and Pterodactyles have the pneumatic\r\ncondition more conspicuously developed in the limb bones. The pneumatic\r\nskeleton, however, appears to be absent from the herbivorous types like\r\nIguanodon and all Dinosaurs which have the Bird-like form of pelvis, and\r\nare most Bird-like in the forms of bones of the hind limb. It is\r\npossible that some of the carnivorous Dinosaurs also possessed limb\r\nbones with pneumatic cavities. Many of those bones are hollow with very\r\nthin walls. If their cavities were connected with the lungs the foramina\r\nare inconspicuous and unlike the immense holes seen in the sides of the\r\nvertebrae.\r\n\r\nAccording to the late Professor Marsh, the limbs of Coelurus and its\r\nallies, which at present are imperfectly known, are in some cases\r\npneumatic. Therefore there is a closer fundamental resemblance between\r\nsome carnivorous Dinosaurs and Pterodactyles than might have been\r\nanticipated. But the skull of Coelurus is unknown, and the fragments of\r\nthe skeleton hitherto published are insufficient to do more than show\r\nthat the two types were near in kindred, though distinct in habit. Each\r\nhas elaborated a skeleton which owes much to the common stock which\r\ntransmitted the vital organs, and the tendency of the bones to take\r\nspecial forms; but which also owes more than can be accurately measured\r\nto the action of muscles in shaping the bones and the influence of the\r\nmechanical conditions of daily life upon the growth of the bones in both\r\nof these orders of animals. Enough is known to prove that all Dinosaurs\r\ncannot be regarded as Ornithosaurs which have not acquired the power of\r\nflight; though the evidence would lead us to believe that the primitive\r\nOrnithosaur was a four-footed animal, before the wing finger became\r\ndeveloped in the fore limb as a means of extending a patagial membrane,\r\nlike the membrane which in the hind limb of Dimorphodon has bent the\r\noutermost digit of the foot upward and outward to support the\r\ncorresponding organ of flight extending down the hind legs.\r\n\r\nIt may thus be seen that the characters of Ornithosaurs which have\r\nalready been spoken of as Reptilian, as distinguished from the\r\nresemblances to Birds, may now with more accuracy be regarded as\r\nDinosaurian. The Dinosaurs, like Pterodactyles, must be regarded as\r\nintermediate in some respects between Reptiles and Birds. The\r\nresemblances enumerated would alone constitute a partial transition from\r\nthe Reptile to the Bird, although no Dinosaurs have organs of flight;\r\nmany are heavily armoured with plates of bone, and few, if any,\r\napproximate in the technical parts of the skeleton to the Bird class,\r\nexcept in the hind limbs. Yet Dinosaurs have sometimes been regarded as\r\nstanding to Birds in the relation of ancestors, or as parallel to an\r\nancestral stock.\r\n\r\nBefore an attempt can be made to estimate the mutual relation of the\r\nFlying Reptiles to Dinosaurs on the one hand, and to Birds on the other,\r\nit may be well to remember that the resemblance of such a Dinosaur as\r\nIguanodon to a Bird in its pelvis and hind limb is not more remarkable\r\nthan that of Pterodactyles to Birds in the shoulder-girdle and bones of\r\nthe fore limb. The keeled sternum, the long, slender coracoid bones and\r\nscapulae, are absolutely Bird-like in most Ornithosaurs; and that region\r\nof the skeleton only differs from Birds in the absence of a furculum\r\nwhich represents the clavicles, and is commonly named the\r\n\"merry-thought.\" The elongated bones of the fore-arm and the hand,\r\nterminating in three sharp claws, are characters in which the fossil\r\nbird Archaeopteryx resembles the Pterodactyle Rhamphorhynchus, a\r\nresemblance which extends to a similar elongation of the tail. It is\r\nremarkable that the resemblance should be so close, since Archaeopteryx\r\naffords the only bird's skeleton known to be contemporary which can be\r\ncompared with the Solenhofen Flying Reptiles. The resemblance may\r\npossibly be closer than has been imagined. The back of the head of\r\nArchaeopteryx is imperfectly preserved in the region of the quadrate\r\nbone, malar arch, and temporal vacuity. And till these are better known\r\nit cannot be affirmed that the back of the head is more Reptilian in\r\nPterodactyles than in the oldest Birds. The side of the head in\r\nArchaeopteryx is distinguished by the nostril being far forward, the\r\nvacuity in front of the orbit being as large as in the Pterodactyle\r\nScaphognathus from Solenhofen and other long-tailed Pterodactyles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nHOW PTERODACTYLES MAY HAVE ORIGINATED\r\n\r\n\r\nOrnithosauria have many characters inseparably blended together which\r\nare otherwise distinctive of Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals, and\r\nassociated with peculiar structures which are absent from all other\r\nanimals. They are not quite alone in this incongruous combination of\r\ndifferent types of animals in the same skeleton. Dinosaurs, which were\r\ncontemporary with Ornithosaurs, approximate to them in blending\r\ncharacters of Birds with the structure of a Reptile and something of a\r\nMammal in one animal. If an Ornithosaur is Reptilian in its backbone, in\r\nthe articular ends of each vertebra having the cup in front and ball\r\nbehind in the manner of Crocodiles, Serpents, and many Lizards, a\r\nDinosaur like Iguanodon, which had the reversed condition of ball in\r\nfront and cup behind in its early vertebrae, may be more Mammalian than\r\nAvian in a corresponding resemblance of the bones to the neck in hoofed\r\nMammals. But while Pterodactyles are sometimes Mammalian in having the\r\nhead of the thigh bone moulded as in carnivorous Mammals and Man, the\r\ncorresponding bone in a Dinosaur is more like that of a Bird. And while\r\nthe Pterodactyle shoulder-girdle is often absolutely Bird-like, that\r\nregion in Dinosaurs can only be paralleled among Reptiles.\r\n\r\nSuch combinations of diverse characters are not limited to animals which\r\nare extinct. There were not wanting scientific men who regarded the\r\nPlatypus of Australia, when first sent to Europe, as an ingenious\r\nexample of Eastern skill, in which an animal had been compounded\r\nartificially by blending the beak of a Bird with the body of a Mammal.\r\nFuller knowledge of that remarkable animal has continuously intensified\r\nwonder at its combination of Mammal, Bird, and Reptile in a single\r\nanimal. It has broken down the theoretical divisions between the higher\r\nVertebrata, demonstrating that a Mammal may lay eggs like a Reptile or\r\nBird, that the skull may include the reptilian characters of the malar\r\narch and pre-frontal and post-frontal bones, otherwise unknown in\r\nMammals and Birds. The groups of Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles now\r\nsurviving on the earth prove to be less sharply defined from each other\r\nwhen the living and extinct types are considered together. But in\r\nPterodactyles, Mammal Bird and Reptile lose their identity, as three\r\ncolours would do when unequally mixed together.\r\n\r\nThis mingling of characteristics of different animals is not to be\r\nattributed to interbreeding, but is the converse of the combination of\r\ncharacters found in hybrid animals. It is no exaggeration to say that\r\nthere is a sense in which Mammal, Bird, Reptile, and the distinctive\r\nstructures of the Ornithosaur, have simultaneously developed from one\r\negg, in the body of one animal.\r\n\r\nThe differences between those vertebrate types of animals consist\r\nchiefly in the way in which their organisation is modified, by one\r\nstrain of characters being eliminated so that another becomes\r\npredominant, while a distinctive set of structures is elaborated in each\r\nclass of animals. The earlier geological history of the higher\r\nVertebrata is very imperfectly known, but the evidence tends to the\r\ninference that the older representatives of the several classes\r\napproximate to each other more closely than do their surviving\r\nrepresentatives, so that in still earlier ages of time the distinction\r\nbetween them had not become recognisable. The relation of the great\r\ngroups of animals to each other, among Vertebrata, is essentially a\r\nparallel relation, like the colours of the solar spectrum, or the\r\nparallel digits of the hand. It was natural, when only the surviving\r\nlife on the earth was known, to imagine that animals were connected in a\r\ncontinuous chain by successive descent, but Mammals have given no\r\nevidence of approximation to Birds; and Birds discover no evidence that\r\ntheir ancestors were Reptiles, in the sense in which that word is used\r\nto define animals which now exist on the earth. When the variation which\r\nanimals attain in their maturity and exhibit in development from the egg\r\nwas first realised, it was imagined that Nature, by slow summing up and\r\naccumulation of differences which were observed, would so modify one\r\nanimal type that it would pass into another. There is little evidence to\r\nsupport belief that the changes between the types of life have been\r\nwrought in that way. The history of fossil animals has not shown\r\ntransitions of this kind from the lower to higher Vertebrata, but only\r\nintermediate, parallel groups of animals, analogous to those which\r\nsurvive, and distinct from them in the same way as surviving groups are\r\ndistinct from each other. The circumstance that Mammals, Birds, and\r\nReptiles are all known low down in the Secondary epoch of geological\r\ntime, is favourable to the idea of their history being parallel rather\r\nthan successive. Such a conception is supported by the theory of\r\nelimination of characters from groups of animals as the basis of their\r\ndifferentiation. This loss appears always to be accompanied by a\r\ncorresponding gain of characters, which is more remarkable in the soft,\r\nvital organs than in the skeleton. The gain in higher Vertebrates in the\r\nbones is chiefly in the perfection of joints at their extremities; but\r\nthe gain in brain, lungs, heart, and other soft parts is an elaboration\r\nof those structures and an increase in amount of tissue.\r\n\r\nThe resemblances of Ornithosaurs to Mammals are the least conspicuous of\r\ntheir characters. Those seen in the upper arm bone and thigh bone are\r\nmanifestly not derived from Mammals. They cannot be explained as\r\nadaptations of the bones to conditions of existence, because there is no\r\ncommunity of habit to be inferred between Pterodactyles and Mammals, in\r\nwhich the bones are in any way comparable.\r\n\r\nOther fossil animals show that a fundamentally Reptilian structure is\r\ncapable of developing in the Mammalian direction in the skull, backbone,\r\nshoulder-girdle, hip-girdle, and limbs, so as to be uniformly Mammalian\r\nin its tendencies. This is proved by tracing the North American Texas\r\nfossils named Labyrinthodonts, through the South African Theriodonts,\r\ntowards the Monotremata and other Mammalia. Just as those animals have\r\nobliterated all traces of the Bird from their skeletons, Birds have\r\nobliterated the distinctive characters of Mammals. The Ornithosaur has\r\npartially obliterated both. With a skull and backbone marked by typical\r\ncharacters of the Reptile, it combines the shoulder-girdle and\r\nhip-girdle of a Bird, with characters in the limbs which suggest both\r\nthose types in combination with Mammals.\r\n\r\nThe bones have been compared in the skeleton of each order of existing\r\nReptiles, and found to show side by side with their peculiar characters\r\nnot only resemblances to the other Reptilia, but an appreciable number\r\nof Mammalian and Avian characters in their skeletons. The term\r\n\"crocodile,\" for example, indicates an animal in which the skeleton is\r\ndominated by one set of peculiar characters. Crocodiles retain enough of\r\nthe characteristics of several other orders of reptiles to show that an\r\nanimal sprung from the old Crocodile stock might diverge widely from\r\nexisting Crocodiles by intensifying what might be termed its dormant\r\ncharacters in the Crocodile skeleton. Comparing animals together bone by\r\nbone it is possible to value the modifications of form which they put\r\non, and the resemblances between them, so as to separate the inherited\r\nwealth of an animal's affinities with ancestors or collateral groups,\r\nfrom the peculiar characters which have been acquired as an increase\r\nbased upon its typical bony possessions or osteological capital. There\r\nis no part of the Pterodactyle skeleton which is more distinctly\r\nmodified than the head of the upper arm bone, which fits into the socket\r\nbetween the coracoid bone and the shoulder-blade. The head of the\r\nhumerus, as the articular part is named, is somewhat crescent-shaped,\r\nconvex on its inner border, and a little concave on its outer border,\r\nand therefore unlike the ball-shaped head of the upper arm bone in Man\r\nand the higher Mammals. It is much more nearly paralleled in the little\r\ngroup of Monotremata allied to the living Ornithorhynchus. In that sense\r\nthe head of the humerus in a Pterodactyle has some affinity with the\r\nlowest Mammalia, which approach nearest to Reptiles. The character might\r\npass unregarded if it were not found in more striking development in\r\nfossil Reptiles from Cape Colony, which from having teeth like Mammals\r\nare named Theriodontia. In several of those South African reptiles the\r\nupper arm bone approaches closer to the humerus in Ornithosaurs than to\r\nOrnithorhynchus. Such coincidences of structure are sometimes dismissed\r\nfrom consideration and placed beyond investigation by being termed\r\nadaptive modifications; but there can be no hope of finding community of\r\nhabit between the burrowing Monotreme, the short-limbed Theriodont, and\r\nthe flying Pterodactyle which might have caused this articular part of\r\nthe upper arm bone to acquire a form so similar in animals constructed\r\nso differently. If the resemblance in the humerus to Monotremes in this\r\nrespect is not to be attributed to burrowing, neither can the crescent\r\nform of its upper articulation be attributed to flight; for in Birds the\r\nhead of the bone is compressed, but always convex, and Bats fly without\r\nany approach to the Pterodactyle form in the head of the humerus. This\r\napparently trivial character may from such comparisons be inferred to be\r\nsomething which the way of life of the animal does not sufficiently\r\naccount for. These deepest-seated parts of the limbs are slow to adapt\r\nthemselves to changing circumstances of existence, and retain their\r\ncharacters with moderate variation of the bones in each of the orders\r\nor classes of animals. It therefore is safer to regard Mammalian\r\ncharacters, as well as the resemblances which Pterodactyles show to\r\nother kinds of animals, as due to inheritance from a time when there was\r\na common stock from which none of these animals which have been\r\nconsidered had been distinctly elaborated.\r\n\r\nA few characters of Ornithosaurs are regarded as having been acquired,\r\nbecause they are not found in any other animals, or have been developed\r\nonly in a portion of the group. The most obvious of these is the\r\nelongated wing finger; but in some genera, like Dimorphodon, there is\r\nalso a less elongation of the fifth digit of the foot, and perhaps in\r\nall genera there is a backward development of the first digit of the\r\nhand, which is without a claw, and therefore unlike the clawed digit of\r\na Bat. An acquired character of another kind, which is limited to the\r\nCretaceous genera, is seen in the shoulder-blade being directed\r\ntransversely outward, so that its truncated end articulates by a true\r\njoint with the early vertebrae of the back, and defended the cavity\r\ninclosed by the ribs by a strong bony external arch. And finally, as the\r\nanimals later in time acquire short tails, and relatively longer limbs,\r\nthe bones of the back of the hand, termed metacarpals, acquire greater\r\nand distinctive length, which is not seen in the long-tailed types like\r\nRhamphorhynchus.\r\n\r\nThese and such-like acquired characters distinguish the class of animals\r\nfrom all groups with which it may be compared, and mark the possible\r\nlimits of variation of the skeleton within the boundary of the order.\r\nBut no further variation of these parts of the skeleton could make a\r\ntransition to another order of animals, or explain how the\r\nPterodactyles came into existence, because the characters which separate\r\norders and classes of animals from each other differ in kind from those\r\nwhich separate smaller groups, named genera and species, of which the\r\norder is made up. The accumulation of the characters of genera will not\r\nsum up into the characters of an order or class.\r\n\r\nIn making the division of Vertebrate animals into classes the skeleton\r\nis often almost ignored. Its value is entirely empirical and based upon\r\nthe observed association of the various forms of bones with the more\r\nimportant characters of the brain and other vital organs. What is\r\nunderstood as a Mammalian or Avian character in the skeleton is the form\r\nof bone which is found in association with the soft vital organs which\r\nconstitute an animal a Mammal or a Bird.\r\n\r\nThe characters which theoretically define a Mammal appear to be the\r\nenormous overgrowth of the cerebral hemispheres of the brain by which\r\nthe cerebrum comes into contact with the cerebellum, as among Birds.\r\nThis character distinguishes both groups of animals from all Reptiles,\r\nrecent and fossil. But in examining the mould of the interior of the\r\nbrain case it is rare to have the bones fitting so closely to the brain\r\nas to prove that the lateral expansion below the cerebrum and cerebellum\r\nis formed by the optic lobes of the brain. Otherwise the brain of a\r\nPterodactyle might be as like to the brain of Ornithorhynchus as it is\r\nlike that of a Bird (Fig. 19). But it is precisely in this condition of\r\narrangement of the parts of the brain that the specimens appear to be\r\nmost clear. The lateral mass of brain in specimens of Ornithosaurs from\r\nthe Lower Secondary rocks appears to be transversely divided into back\r\nand front parts, which may be thought to correspond to the structures in\r\na Mammal brain named _corpora quadrigemina_, but to be placed as the\r\noptic lobes are placed in Birds, and to have relatively greater\r\ndimensions than in Mammals. No evidence has been observed of this\r\ntransverse division of the optic lobes of the brain in Pterodactyles\r\nfrom the Chalk and Cretaceous rocks, and so far as the evidence goes\r\nthis part of the brain was shaped as in birds, but rather smaller.\r\n\r\nThe brain is the only soft organ in which a Mammalian character could be\r\nevidenced. The uniformity in character of the brain throughout the group\r\nin Mammals is remarkable, in reference to the circumstance that the\r\nreproduction varies in type; the lowest, or Monotreme division, being\r\noviparous. If there is no necessary connexion between the Mammalian\r\nbrain and the prevalent condition under which the young are produced\r\nalive, it may be affirmed also that there is no necessary connexion\r\nbetween the form of the brain and the form of the bones, since the brain\r\ncavity in Theriodont reptiles shows no resemblance to that of a Mammal,\r\nwhile the bones are in so many respects only paralleled among\r\nMonotremata and Mammalia. The variety of forms which the existing\r\nMammalian orders of animals assume, shows the astonishing range of\r\nstructure of the skeleton which may coexist with the Mammalian brain.\r\nAnd therefore we are led to the conclusion that any other fundamental\r\nmodification of brain--such as distinguishes the class of Birds--might\r\nalso be associated with forms and structures of the skeleton which\r\nwould vary in similar ways. In other words, if for convenience we define\r\na Mammal by its form of brain, structure of the heart and lungs, and\r\nprovision for nutrition of the young, without regard to the covering of\r\nthe skin, which varies between the scales of a pangolin and the\r\npractically naked skin of the whale--a bird might be also defined by its\r\npeculiar conditions of brain and lungs, without reference to the\r\nfeathered condition of the skin, though the feathered condition extends\r\nbackward in time to the Upper Secondary rocks, as seen in the\r\nArchaeopteryx.\r\n\r\nThe Avian characters of Pterodactyles are the predominant parts of their\r\norganisation, for the conditions of the brain and lungs shown by the\r\nmoulds of the brain case and the thin hollow bones with conspicuous\r\npneumatic foramina, give evidence of a community of vital structures\r\nwith Birds, which is supported by characters of the skeleton. If any\r\nclassificational value can be associated with the distribution of the\r\npneumatic foramina as tending to establish membership of the same class\r\nfor animals fashioned on the same plan of soft organs, the evidence is\r\nnot weakened when a community of structures is found to extend among the\r\nbones to such distinctive parts of the skeleton as the sternum,\r\nshoulder-girdle, bones of the fore-arm and fore-leg; for in all these\r\nregions the Pterodactyle bones are practically indistinguishable from\r\nthose of Birds. This is the more remarkable because other parts of the\r\nskeleton, such as the humerus and pelvis, show a partial resemblance to\r\nBirds, while the parts which are least Avian, like the neck bones, have\r\nno tendency to vary the number of the vertebrae, in the way which is\r\ncommon among Birds, following more closely the formula of the seven\r\ncervical vertebrae of Mammals.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore appear from the vital community of structures with\r\nBirds, that Pterodactyles and Birds are two parallel groups, which may\r\nbe regarded as ancient divergent forks of the same branch of animal\r\nlife, which became distinguished from each other by acquiring the\r\ndifferent condition of the skin, and the structures which were developed\r\nin consequence of the bony skeleton ministering to flight in different\r\nways; and with different habit of terrestrial progression, this extinct\r\ngroup of animals acquired some modifications of the skeleton which Birds\r\nhave not shown. There is nothing to suggest that Pterodactyles are a\r\nbranch from Birds, but their relation to Birds is much closer, so far as\r\nthe skeleton goes, than is their relation with the flightless Dinosaurs,\r\nwith which Birds and Pterodactyles have many characters in common.\r\n\r\nOn the theory of elimination of character which I have used to account\r\nfor the disappearance of some Mammalian characters from the\r\nPterodactyle, that loss is seen chiefly in the removal of the parts\r\nwhich have left a Reptilian articulation of the lower jaw with the\r\nskull, and the articulation of the vertebrae throughout the vertebral\r\ncolumn by a modified cup-and-ball form of joint. The furculum of the\r\nBird is always absent from the Pterodactyle. No specimen has shown\r\nrecognisable clavicles or collar-bones. Judged by the standard of\r\nexisting life, Pterodactyles belong to the same group as Birds, on the\r\nevidence of brain and lungs, but they belong to a different group on\r\naccount of the dissimilar modifications of the skeleton and apparent\r\nabsence of feathers from the skin.\r\n\r\nThe most impressive facts in the Pterodactyle skeleton, in view of these\r\naffinities, are the structures which it has in common with Reptiles.\r\nSome structures are fundamental, like the cup-and-ball articulation of\r\nthe vertebrae, which is never found in birds or mammals. Although not\r\nquite identical with the condition in any Reptile, this structure is\r\napproximately Lizard-like or Crocodile-like in the cup-and-ball\r\ncharacter. It shows that the deepest-seated part of the skeleton is\r\nReptile-like, though it may not be more Reptilian than is the vertebral\r\ncolumn of a Mammal, if comparison is made between Mammals and extinct\r\ngroups of animals known as Reptiles, such as Dinosaurs and Theriodontia.\r\n\r\nThe orders of animals which have been included under the name Reptilia\r\ncomprise such different structural conditions of the parts of the\r\nskeleton which may be termed reptilian in Ornithosaurs, that there is\r\ngood reason for regarding the cup-and-ball articulation as quite a\r\ndistinctive Reptilian specialisation, in the same sense that the\r\nsaddle-shaped articulation between the bodies of adjacent vertebrae in a\r\nbird is an Avian specialisation. From the theoretical point of view the\r\nOrnithosaur acquired its Reptilian characters simultaneously with its\r\nAvian and Mammalian characters.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the structure of the skeleton of the Dinosauria, to\r\nwhich Ornithosaurs approximate in several parts of the body, which would\r\nhelp to explain the cup-and-ball articulation of the backbone, if the\r\nFlying Reptile were supposed to be an offshoot from the carnivorous\r\nDinosaurs.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of Reptile characters from so much of the skeleton, and\r\nthe substitution for them of the characters of Birds and Mammals, would\r\nbe of exceptional interest if there had been any ground for regarding\r\nthe flying animal as more nearly related to a Reptile than to a Bird.\r\nBut if the evidence from the form of the brain and nature of the\r\npneumatic organs seen in the limb bones accounts for the Avian features\r\nof the skeleton, the Reptilian condition of the vertebral column helps\r\nto show a capacity for variation, and that the fixity of type and\r\nstructure, which the skeleton of the modern Bird has attained, is not\r\nnecessarily limited to or associated with the vital organs of Birds.\r\n\r\nThe variation of the cup-and-ball articulation in the neck of a\r\nChelonian, which makes the third vertebra cupped behind, the fourth\r\nbi-convex, the fifth cupped in front, and the sixth flattened behind,\r\nshows that too much importance may be attached to the mode of union of\r\nthese bones in Serpents, Crocodiles, and those Lizards which have the\r\ncup in front; for while in Lizards the anterior cup, oblique and\r\ndepressed, is found in most of its groups, the Geckos show no trace of\r\nthe cup-and-ball structure, and in that respect resemble the Hatteria of\r\nNew Zealand.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the cup-and-ball articulation of vertebrae in\r\nOrnithosauria has any significance as a mark of affinity to Reptiles, it\r\ncould only be in approximation to those living Reptiles which possess\r\nthe same character, and would have it on the hypothesis that both have\r\npreserved the structure by descent from an earlier type of animal. This\r\nhypothesis is negatived by the fact that the cup-and-ball articulation\r\nis unknown in the older fossil Reptiles.\r\n\r\nAlthough the articulation for the lower jaw with the skull in\r\nOrnithosaurs is only to be paralleled among Reptiles, the structure is\r\nadapted to a brain case which is practically indistinguishable from that\r\nof a Bird, except for the postorbital arch.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of descent, therefore, becomes impossible, in any\r\nintelligible form, in explanation of distinctive character of the\r\nskeleton. The hypothesis of elimination may also seem to be\r\ninsufficient, unless the potential capacity for new development be\r\nrecognised as concurrent, and as capable of modifying each region of the\r\nskeleton, or hard parts of the animal, in the same way that the soft\r\norgans may be modified. From which we infer that all structures, which\r\ndistinguish the several grades of organisation in modern\r\nclassifications, soft parts and hard parts alike, may come into\r\nexistence together, in so far as they are compatible with each other, in\r\nany class or ordinal division of animals.\r\n\r\nAlthough the young Mammal passes through a stage of growth in which the\r\nbrain may be said to be Reptilian, there is no good ground for inferring\r\nthat Mammal or Bird type of skeleton was developed later in time than\r\nthat of Reptiles. The various types of Fishes have the brains in general\r\nso similar to those of Reptiles that it is more intelligible for all the\r\nvertebrate forms of brain to have differentiated at the same time, under\r\nthe law of elimination of characters, than that there should be any\r\nother bond of union between the classes of animals.\r\n\r\nIf we ask what started the Ornithosauria into existence, and created the\r\nplan of construction of that animal type, I think science is justified\r\nin boldly affirming that the initial cause can only be sought under the\r\ndevelopment of patagial membranes, such as have been seen in various\r\nanimals ministering to flight. Such membranes, in an animal which was\r\npotentially a Bird in its vital organs, have owed development to the\r\nabsence of quill feathers. Thus the wing membrane may be the cause for\r\nthe chief differences of the skeleton by which Ornithosaurs are\r\nseparated from Birds, for the stretch of wing in one case is made by the\r\nskin attached to the bones, and in the other case by feathers on the\r\nskin so attached as to necessitate that the wing bones have different\r\nproportions from Ornithosaurs.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known observation that each great epoch of geological time\r\nhas had its dominant forms of animal life, which, so far as the earth's\r\nhistory is known now, came into existence, lived their time, and were\r\nseen no more. In the same way the smaller groups of species and genera\r\nincluded in an ordinal group of animals or class have abounded, giving a\r\ntone to the life of each geological formation, until the vitality of the\r\nanimal is exhausted, and the species becomes extinct or ceases to\r\npreponderate. This process is seen to be still modifying the life on the\r\nearth, when some kinds of animals and plants are introduced to new\r\nconditions. Plants appear to wage successful war more easily than\r\nanimals. The introduction of the Cactus in some parts of Cape Colony has\r\nlocally modified both the fauna and flora, just as the Anacharis\r\nintroduced into England spread from Cambridge over the whole country,\r\nand became for many years the predominant form of plant life in the\r\nstreams. The Rabbit in Australia is a historic pest. Something similar\r\nto this physical fertility and increase appears to take place under new\r\ncircumstances in certain organs within the bodies of animals, by the\r\ndevelopment of structures previously unknown. A familiar example is seen\r\nin the internal anatomy of the Trout introduced into New Zealand, where\r\nthe number of pyloric appendages about the stomach has become rapidly\r\naugmented, while the size and the form of the animal have changed. The\r\nrapidity with which some of these changes have been brought about would\r\nappear to show that Nature is capable of transforming animals more\r\nrapidly than might have been inferred from their uniform life under\r\nordinary circumstances. Growth of the vital organs in this way may\r\nmodify the distinctive form of any vital organ, brain or lungs, and thus\r\nas a consequence of modification of the internal structures due to\r\nchanges of food and habit, bring a new group of animals into existence.\r\nAnd just as the group of animals ceases to predominate after a time, so\r\nthere comes a limit to the continued internal development of vital\r\nstructures as their energy fails, for each organ behaves to some extent\r\nlike an independent organism.\r\n\r\nUnder such explanations of the mutual relations of the parts of animals,\r\nand groups of animals, time ceases to be a factor of primary importance\r\nin their construction or elaboration. The supposed necessity for\r\npractically unlimited time to produce changes in the vital organs which\r\nseparate animals into great orders or classes is a nightmare, born of\r\nhypothesis, and may be profitably dismissed. The geological evidence is\r\ntoo imperfect for dogmatism on speculative questions; but the nature of\r\nthe affinities of Ornithosaurs to other animals has been established on\r\na basis of comparison which has no need of theory to justify the facts.\r\nIt is not improbable that the primary epoch of time, even as known at\r\npresent, may be sufficiently long to contain the parent races from which\r\nOrnithosaurs and all their allies have arisen.\r\n\r\nIn thus stating the relation of Ornithosaurs to other animals the Flying\r\nReptile has been traced home to kindred, though not to its actual\r\nparents or birthplace. There is no geological history of the rapid or\r\ngradual development of the wing finger, and although the wing membrane\r\nmay be accepted as its cause of existence, the wing finger is powerfully\r\ndeveloped in the oldest known Pterodactyles as in their latest\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nPterodactyles show singularly little variation in structure in their\r\ngeological history. We chronicle the loss of the tail and loss of teeth.\r\nThere is also the loss of the outermost wing digit from the hind foot as\r\na supporter of the wing membrane. But the other variations are in the\r\nlength of the metacarpus, or of the neck, or head. One of the\r\nfundamental laws of life necessitates that when an animal type ceases to\r\nadapt its organisation and modify its structures to suit the altered\r\ncircumstances forced upon it by revolutions of the earth's surface its\r\nlife's history becomes broken. It must bend or break.\r\n\r\nThe final disappearance of these animals from the earth's history in the\r\nChalk may yet be modified by future discoveries, but the Flying Reptiles\r\nhave vanished, in the same way as so many other groups of animals which\r\nwere contemporary with them in the Secondary period of time. Such\r\nextinctions have been attributed to catastrophes, like the submergence\r\nof land, so that the habitations of animals became an area gradually\r\ndecreasing in size, which at last disappeared. It appears also to be a\r\nlaw of life, illustrated by many extinct groups of animals, that they\r\nendure for geological ages, and having fought their battle in life's\r\nhistory, grow old and unable to continue the fight, and then disappear\r\nfrom the earth, giving place to more vigorous types adapted to live\r\nunder new conditions.\r\n\r\nThe extinct Pterodactyles hold a relation to Birds in the scheme of life\r\nnot unlike that which Monotremata hold to other Mammals. Both are\r\nremarkable for the variety of their affinities and resemblances to\r\nReptiles. The Ornithosauria have long passed away; the Monotremes are\r\nnearing extinction. Both appear to be supplanted by parallel groups\r\nwhich were their contemporaries. Birds now fill the earth in a way that\r\nFlying Reptiles never surpassed; but their flight is made in a different\r\nmanner, and the wing is extended to support the animal in the air,\r\nchiefly by appendages to the skin.\r\n\r\nIf these fossils have taught that Ornithosaurs have a community of soft\r\nvital organs with Dinosaurs and Birds, they have also gone some way\r\ntowards proving that causes similar to those which determined the\r\nstructural peculiarities of their bony framework, originated the special\r\nforms of respiratory organs and brain which lifted them out of\r\nassociation with existing Reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese old flying animals sleep through geological ages, not without\r\nhonour, for the study of their story has illuminated the mode of origin\r\nof animals which survive them, and in cleaving the rocks to display\r\ntheir bones we have opened a new page of the book of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best public collections of Ornithosaurian remains in England are\r\nin the British Museum (Natural History); Museum of Practical Geology,\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons; the University Museum, Oxford; Geological\r\nMuseum, Cambridge; and the Museum of the Philosophical Society at\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nDetailed descriptions and original figures of the principal specimens\r\nmentioned or referred to may be found in the following writings:--\r\n\r\n  H. v.
