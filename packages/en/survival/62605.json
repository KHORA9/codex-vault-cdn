Therefore, in most cities\r\nand in some rural areas sanitary codes regulate the disposal of wastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF SEWAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nHousehold sewage ordinarily consists principally of human excrement,\r\ntoilet paper, garbage, dish water, and other wash water from the\r\nvarious plumbing fixtures and floor drains.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of bacteria, at times disease-producing ones, are contained\r\nin the discharges from the human body. Epidemics of typhoid fever,\r\ndysentery, diarrhea, cholera, and other water-borne diseases may\r\nresult from the pollution of the water supply with sewage. Pollution\r\nis carried by water moving underground, as well as by water flowing\r\non the surface. This is especially true in limestone regions, where\r\nunderground channels and rock crevices permit water to flow for\r\nconsiderable distances with little filtering action. Sewage used for\r\nfertilizing or irrigating crops[2] may contaminate vegetables or the\r\nudders of cows and thus spread disease. Anthrax, cholera, and parasitic\r\nworms may be present in the surface drainage from fields and barn lots.\r\nIt is wise to regard all sewage as dangerous and to dispose of it\r\npromptly in a sanitary manner, so that disease germs will not pollute\r\nthe water supplies or be spread by flies, animals, or man.\r\n\r\n[2] This subject is discussed at length in Technical Bulletin 675,\r\nSewage Irrigation as Practiced in the Western States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION OF WATER SOURCES FROM HOUSEHOLD WASTES\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder most farm conditions a safe place for the disposal of wastes\r\nis in the upper 3-foot layer of soil, where the action of bacteria\r\ntends to render it harmless. Tile disposal fields, such as are used\r\nwith septic tanks, and earth-pit privies accomplish this if the water\r\ntable remains several feet below the surface and if the location is\r\nremote from water supplies. Cesspools and other types of pits do not\r\nordinarily confine contamination to their immediate vicinity and are\r\nnot recommended except for special conditions.\r\n\r\nSewage or other wastes discharged into abandoned wells or other pits\r\nthat reach to the water table or below it are almost certain to\r\ncontaminate the ground water.\r\n\r\nIt is generally poor practice, and often illegal, to discharge wastes\r\ninto surface streams. Streams do not necessarily purify themselves\r\nin 50 feet, 100 feet, or some other stated distance, as is commonly\r\nbelieved. They do tend to purify themselves over long distances through\r\nthe action of sunlight, aeration, and other factors but may not be\r\nsafe for domestic use for many miles below the source of pollution.\r\nClear, sparkling water is not always safe drinking water. Streams in\r\nagricultural communities are subject to many sources of pollution and\r\nthey are likely to become more contaminated as they merge into larger\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTIC-TANK SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptic-tank systems, if installed and maintained properly, provide the\r\nmost sanitary method of sewage disposal for farmhouses equipped with\r\nrunning water.\r\n\r\nGround water or rock close to the surface, lack of sufficient fall for\r\nthe sewage to flow by gravity, and too small an absorption area for the\r\neffluent limit the satisfactory operation of a septic tank. When these\r\nconditions exist, special advice should be sought from a competent\r\nlocal sanitary authority. Adverse soil conditions can be overcome if\r\nsufficient fall and space are available.\r\n\r\nThe five essential parts (fig. 1) of a septic-tank system are (1)\r\nthe house sewer; (2) the septic tank; (3) the effluent sewer; (4)\r\nthe distribution box; and (5) the disposal field. In special cases a\r\ngrease trap (see fig. 11, p. 19) is added. To facilitate inspection and\r\nrepairs it is good practice to keep in the house a chart showing the\r\nlocation of the tank and other parts of the system.\r\n\r\nA septic tank does not necessarily purify the sewage, eliminate odor,\r\nor destroy all solid matter. Its purpose is to condition the sewage or\r\ndomestic waste by bacterial action, so that it can be disposed of in a\r\nmore satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--A septic-tank system.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATION OF A SEPTIC-TANK SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIn a septic-tank system the sewage flows by gravity from the farmhouse\r\nthrough the sewer into the tank, where it should remain at least 24\r\nhours. While passing through the tank the solids are acted upon by\r\nanaerobic bacteria, which work only in the dark and where there is\r\nlittle air. The heavy particles settle to the bottom as sludge, the\r\nlighter particles float as scum, and the remainder passes out of the\r\ntank through the effluent sewer to the disposal field. The gas released\r\nin the process escapes through a vent provided either in the =T= to the\r\nhouse sewer or the effluent sewer.\r\n\r\nA tank that is too small may fill up with solids in a short while,\r\nbecause sufficient time is not allowed for breaking them down by\r\nfermentation, or the sewage may be pushed right through into the\r\ndisposal field and clog it.\r\n\r\nThe effluent may contain even more disease germs than the original\r\nsewage, and though it may be as clear as spring water it is far from\r\npure and may cause foul odors if discharged or allowed to pool on the\r\nsurface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe final disposition of the effluent into the upper layer of the soil\r\nexposes it to the action of aerobic bacteria. These bacteria, unlike\r\nthose in the tank, need air and cannot work in saturated soil or live\r\nmuch more than 3 feet below the surface of the ground. The \"living\r\nearth,\" or upper stratum, teems with these bacteria, which convert the\r\ndangerous sewage and disease germs into harmless matter and thus tend\r\nto purify the effluent if it remains long enough in the top layers of\r\nsoil before seeping into the subsoil and thence to the ground water.\r\nEffluent discharged deep in the soil does not receive the benefit of\r\nthis purifying action.\r\n\r\nSeveral types of septic tanks are in common use. The one described in\r\nthis bulletin is the single-chamber type, which can be built with or\r\nwithout siphon. This should meet all average farm needs where there\r\nare not more than 16 members in the household. It would be advisable\r\nto consult the authorities of the State agricultural college or local\r\nhealth department as to their recommendations because frequently local\r\nconditions and larger establishments require special installations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTING THE SITE\r\n\r\nFirst install the tile disposal field where there will be least danger\r\nof polluting water supplies, at least 100 feet from water sources if\r\npossible and always at a lower surface elevation. This is of greatest\r\nimportance. Even though selecting a more distant location would result\r\nin greater initial cost, it would be a good investment as protection\r\nagainst diseases that might result from pollution of water sources.\r\nThe site should slope away from the house and away from the source of\r\nwater. Gentle unshaded slopes free of trees or shrubbery are best.\r\nRoot-free locations are important because the open-jointed tile cannot\r\nbe \"rootproofed.\" Porous, well-drained, gravelly, or sandy soil allows\r\ngreater purification. Do not have the disposal field in vegetable\r\ngardens, under roadways, in swampy land, in muck soils, or in areas\r\nhaving rock substrata sloping toward the water supply. Allow sufficient\r\narea, where available, to enlarge the field later if needed.\r\n\r\nThe septic tank may be close to the house, but a more distant site\r\nwould reduce the likelihood of odors if leakage occurs. The tank should\r\nalso be kept 50 feet or more from any source of water supply and at a\r\nlower elevation. It should not be placed under driveways, pavements, or\r\nflower beds, as these would make it not readily accessible for periodic\r\ninspection. Care should be taken to insure that surface drainage from\r\nthe area around the tank will not reach the vicinity of the water\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE SEWER\r\n\r\nMaterial\r\n\r\nVitrified salt-glazed clay or well-made concrete sewer pipe and\r\ncast-iron soil pipe are the standard materials for house sewers on\r\nfarms. Asphalt-impregnated fiber pipe, of a type designed especially\r\nfor house sewers, appears to be satisfactory for this purpose.\r\nCast-iron soil pipe with leaded joints should be used when the sewer is\r\nwithin 50 feet of a well or suction line from a well, within 10 feet\r\nof any drinking-water supply line under pressure, within 5 feet of\r\nbasement foundations, or when laid beneath driveways with less than 3\r\nfeet of earth covering the pipes. When within 15 feet of large trees or\r\nshrubs, the sewers should have root-tight joints.\r\n\r\nSize\r\n\r\nFor house sewers, 4- and 6-inch pipes are generally used. Where a\r\n4-inch pipe is used, cast-iron is commonly recommended. Grades with\r\nlittle fall require larger pipes. The large sizes are also less liable\r\nto become clogged. Clay pipe is made in pieces 2 or 2-1/2 feet long,\r\nwhereas fiber-pipe sections are 4 feet long and cast-iron pipe 5 feet\r\nlong, so that there are fewer joints. The minimum number of joints is\r\ndesirable, as there is less danger of stoppage.\r\n\r\nAlinement\r\n\r\nRun the house sewer in a straight line and avoid bends whenever\r\npossible. Slight changes in direction may be made with one-sixteenth or\r\none-eighth bend fittings. For sharper changes of direction a manhole or\r\ndistribution box may be used. Changes in direction of more than 45 are\r\nnot recommended unless a manhole is provided. Clean-outs are desirable\r\nwithin 5 feet of the septic tank where tanks are placed more than 20\r\nfeet from the building and the sewer line is not buried deeper than 4\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nEstablishing Line and Grade\r\n\r\nThe trench for laying the sewer is usually dug after the septic-tank\r\nexcavation has been completed and the elevation of the tank inlet\r\ndetermined. A simple method of setting guides for the excavation is\r\nillustrated in figure 2.\r\n\r\nDigging the Trench\r\n\r\nStart digging the trench at the tank end, so that rain or seepage will\r\nhave an outlet. Rounding the bottom of the trench to the shape of the\r\npipe and hollowing out basins for the \"bell\" ends allows the pipe to\r\nrest firmly throughout its full length, permits full calking of joints,\r\nand relieves the strain on them.\r\n\r\nLaying the Pipe\r\n\r\nBegin laying the pipe at the tank with the bell end uphill. Joints in\r\nclay-tile pipe are commonly made with portland cement mortar or grout.\r\nWhere root-proof joints are essential, sulfur-sand compounds may be\r\nused or copper rings provided and used with cement-mortar joints.\r\nAsphalt-mastic compounds, however, are more satisfactory. For cast-iron\r\nsoil pipe, lead is the standard joint material.\r\n\r\nAfter the hub is pushed into the bell, oakum (or old hemp rope) is\r\npacked with a calking iron or a piece of wood (fig. 3, _A_.) solidly\r\nand evenly in the joint to a depth of about half an inch to center the\r\nhub end in the bell and to keep the joint filler from getting inside\r\nthe pipe. Oil, grease, or dirt on the joint surfaces should be removed,\r\nas it will prevent joint material from sticking. Figure 3 shows the\r\ndifferent jointing methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Establishing grade for sewer. _A_,\r\n2- by 4-inch stakes are set each side of the trench at convenient\r\ndistances _a_, _b_, _c_, and _d_. Then a board is nailed horizontally\r\non the stakes at _d_ at a convenient height above the bottom of the\r\ntrench, that is, the bottom of the sewer leaving the house. A board is\r\nnailed likewise to the stakes at a the same height above the inlet to\r\nthe tank that _d_ is above the bottom of the trench. Similarly, boards\r\nare set at _b_ and _c_ by sighting from _a_ to _d_ so the tops of the\r\nintermediate boards will be in line. _B_, The exact grade of the sewer\r\nis obtained by measuring from the grade cord with the 1- by 1-inch\r\nstick, shown in detail. The length of the stick must equal the height\r\nof the board above sewer at _d_.]\r\n\r\nBituminous, sulfur-sand, lead, and other commercial joint compounds are\r\npoured while hot into the joint from a ladle (fig. 3, _F_), and when\r\nthe work is well done they form a joint that is practically root-proof.\r\nThey are more expensive than cement mortar.\r\n\r\nFor molding hot compounds, a clay dike, or funnel, built about 3 inches\r\nhigh around the triangular opening at the top of the jointer greatly\r\naids in the rapid and complete filling of the joint space. A hot joint\r\nmust be poured continuously, otherwise a seam may develop between\r\nsuccessive pourings.\r\n\r\nBituminous compounds make a slightly elastic joint. A joint in 4-inch\r\npipe requires about 3/8 to 1/2 pound of compound and in 6-inch pipe\r\nabout 1 to 1-1/2 pounds.\r\n\r\nSulfur-sand joints are hard and inelastic. The compound is made by\r\nmixing together equal volumes of ordinary powdered sulfur and very\r\nfine clean sand, preferably the finest quicksand, and then heating\r\nthe mixture until the sulfur melts. A 4-inch joint takes about 3/4\r\npound and a 6-inch joint about 1-7/8 pounds of the mixture. Commercial\r\nsulfur-joint compounds also are available.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Jointing sewer pipe. _A_, Using\r\ncalking iron to force packing into joint. _B_, Making joint with 1:2\r\nportland cement mortar. Use only enough water to dampen the mix. Recalk\r\nafter half an hour, to close shrinkage cracks. _C_, The completed\r\njoint. Wrap finished joint with cloth and keep dampened, to aid\r\ncuring. _D_, Joint made by pouring 1:1 Portland cement grout of creamy\r\nconsistency into a form. This type of joint is not feasible unless the\r\nmetal forms shown are available. _E_, Use of asbestos runner clamped\r\naround pipe, for pouring hot joint. _F_, Clay roll used in place of\r\nasbestos runner. _G_, A completed bituminous joint. _H_, Use of swab,\r\nto remove any joint material forced through to inside of pipe.]\r\n\r\nSoft pig lead or old scrap lead is suitable for lead joints on\r\ncast-iron pipe. About 3/4 pound per inch of pipe diameter is generally\r\nrequired for each joint. The lead is hot enough to pour when it begins\r\nto char the paddle used to skim off the impurities. When it cools it\r\nmust be calked tightly to take up shrinkage. The calking should be\r\nuniform around the entire joint and should stop when the lead is tight.\r\nHeavy pounding or continued calking may crack the bell of the pipe.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to get good, joints when the pipe is in a vertical\r\nposition. Therefore, two lengths of pipe are frequently joined and are\r\nthen laid as a single unit in the trench. In using terra cotta pipe,\r\nthis procedure may be followed only when the joint is made with a\r\nmastic compound. Cement-mortar joints cannot be used in such cases.\r\n\r\nBefore filling the trench, the sewer should be tested to detect\r\npossible leaks. Earth free from rubbish and large stones should then be\r\ntamped around and about 1 foot above the pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEPTIC TANK\r\n\r\nFlow Through the Tank\r\n\r\nSlow, undisturbed flow through the tank is necessary for the separation\r\nof solids and liquids and for bacterial action. Submerged inlets\r\nand outlets or baffle boards reduce disturbance. A submerged outlet\r\nprevents scum from passing out with the effluent.\r\n\r\nThe single-chamber tank without a siphon, shown in figure 4, is easy\r\nto build, inexpensive, and entirely satisfactory in most instances. In\r\nvery tight soils or for large installations a siphon and sometimes two\r\nchambers are advisable.\r\n\r\nSize\r\n\r\nThe tank should be large enough to retain the sewage at least 24 hours.\r\nThe size should be determined by the largest number of persons that may\r\nlive in the house, rather than by the number actually living there at\r\nthe time the tank is built. The additional cost of a large tank over a\r\nsmall one is relatively little. If there is any question as to which\r\nof two sizes should be built, it is wise to choose the larger. The\r\ndimensions recommended in the table in figure 4 are based on an average\r\nproduction of 50 gallons of sewage per person per day.\r\n\r\nUnusually large quantities of sewage call for a tank of large capacity.\r\nIn village and suburban homes where there is less food preparation\r\nthan on farms and where the number of persons is more or less fixed,\r\nslightly smaller sizes will serve. In no case should the capacity of\r\nthe tank below the flow line be less than 500 gallons. A tank length of\r\ntwo to three times the width should be maintained, and it is advisable\r\nto provide a depth of at least 4 feet below the flow line.\r\n\r\nAllow about 1 foot of \"freeboard,\" or air space, above the flow line\r\nfor the accumulation of gases. This space is generally vented through\r\nthe soil stack of the house.\r\n\r\nA siphon (fig. 5) with a dosing chamber is not considered necessary\r\nfor a farm septic tank except for large installations (1,000 gallons\r\nor more), for those in tight soils, and where the disposal field is\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |            CAPACITIES, DIMENSIONS, AND CONCRETE MATERIALS                 |\r\n |           FOR SEPTIC TANKS SERVING INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS                   |\r\n +---------+--------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n |_Maximum |_Liquid |_Recommended inside dimensions_ |_Materials for concrete|\r\n |number of|capacity+-------+--------+-------+-------+     1:2-1/2:4 mix_    |\r\n |persons  |of tank |_Width_|_Length_|_Liquid|_Total +-------+-------+-------+\r\n |served_  |  in    |       |        | depth_| depth_|_Cement|_Sand  |_Gravel|\r\n |         |gallons_|       |        |       |       | sacks_| cubic | cubic |\r\n |         |        |       |        |       |       |       | yards_| yards_|\r\n +---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n |4 or less|   500  | 3'-0\" |  6'-0\" | 4'-0\" | 5'-0\" |   16  | 1-1/2 |  2-1/2|\r\n +---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n |6        |   600  | 3'-0\" |  7'-0\" | 4'-0\" | 5'-0\" |   17  | 1-3/4 |  2-3/4|\r\n +---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n |8        |   750  | 3'-6\" |  7'-6\" | 4'-0\" | 5'-0\" |   19  | 2     |  3    |\r\n +---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n |10       |   900  | 3'-6\" |  8'-6\" | 4'-0\" | 5'-0\" |   21  | 2-1/4 |  3-1/4|\r\n +---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n |12       |  1100  | 4'-0\" |  5'-6\" | 4'-6\" | 5'-6\" |   24  | 2-1/4 |  3-1/2|\r\n +---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n |14       |  1200  | 4'-0\" |  5'-0\" | 4'-6\" | 5'-6\" |   25  | 2-1/2 |  3-3/4|\r\n +---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n |16       |  1500  | 4'-6\" | 10'-0\" | 4'-6\" | 5'-6\" |   28  | 2-3/4 |  4-1/4|\r\n +---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\nFigure 4.--Single-chamber septic tank. Note alternate use of baffle\r\nboards where sanitary tees are omitted at inlet and outlet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe siphon provides intermittent discharge of effluent, which allows\r\ntime for the disposal area to rest and aerate between discharges. This\r\nis more important where the discharge is nearly continuous than in\r\nsmall installations.\r\n\r\nThe frequency and volume of the discharge into the tile field are\r\ncontrolled by the sizes of the siphon and the dosage chamber. The\r\ndealer should be informed of the size of the tank and the number of\r\npersons in the household, in order that he may furnish the proper\r\nunit. A 3- or 4-inch siphon will be adequate for almost any farmhouse\r\ninstallation.\r\n\r\nConstruction\r\n\r\nMost septic tanks are built of concrete cast in place, since in this\r\nway there is a minimum possibility of cracks developing. Concrete\r\nblocks, however (not cinder blocks), stone, brick, or structural tile\r\nare sometimes used. Prefabricated commercial tanks of concrete and\r\nvarious other materials also are available.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |                       SIPHON                                 |\r\n +--------------------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n |_Diameter of siphon       |_Clearance under bell              |\r\n |   A - 3\" or 4\"_          |  E - 2\"_                          |\r\n +--------------------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n |_Diameter of bell         |_Distance across U-trap            |\r\n |   B - 10\"or 12\"_         |  F - 10\" or 12\"_                  |\r\n +--------------------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n |_Bottom of outlet         |_Bottom of outlet                  |\r\n |  to discharge line       |   to bottom of U-trap             |\r\n |   C - 20-1/2\" to 25-3/4\"_|  G - 12\" or 13\"_                  |\r\n +--------------------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n |_Drawing depth            |_Height above floor                |\r\n |   D - 13\" to 17\"_        |  H - 7-1/4\"to 11-3/4\"_            |\r\n +--------------------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n |                 DIMENSIONS OF DOSING CHAMBER                 |\r\n +-----------------+-------------------+------------+-----------+\r\n | _Number of      |_Depth below       |            |           |\r\n | persons served_ | discharge line_[3]| _Width_[4] | _Length_  |\r\n +-----------------+-------------------+------------+-----------+\r\n |   4 or less     | 16-1/4\" to 20-1/4\"|    3'-0\"   |   6'-0\"   |\r\n +-----------------+-------------------+------------+-----------+\r\n |   6             |         \"         |    3'-0\"   |   7'-0\"   |\r\n +-----------------+-------------------+------------+-----------+\r\n |   8             |         \"         |    3'-6\"   |   7'-6\"   |\r\n +-----------------+-------------------+------------+-----------+\r\n |  10             |         \"         |    3'-6\"   |   8'-6\"   |\r\n +-----------------+-------------------+------------+-----------+\r\n |  12             |         \"         |    4'-0\"   |   8'-6\"   |\r\n +-----------------+-------------------+------------+-----------+\r\n |  14             |         \"         |    4'-0\"   |   9'-0\"   |\r\n +-----------------+-------------------+------------+-----------+\r\n |  16             |         \"         |    4'-6\"   |  10'-0\"   |\r\n +-----------------+-------------------+------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n[3] Depending upon depth C of siphon.\r\n\r\n[4] Same as single chamber tank fig. 4.\r\n\r\nFigure 5.--Typical design for a concrete septic tank with a dosing\r\nchamber and a siphon.\r\n\r\nMasonry units should be laid in full beds of 1:3 cement mortar and\r\nthe walls and floor plastered with at least a 1/2-inch coat of 1:2\r\nmortar. Cells of concrete blocks and tile must be filled with concrete.\r\nMasonry walls are generally 8 inches thick, and care must be taken to\r\nfollow _inside_ dimensions given for concrete tanks. Directions for\r\nlaying structural tile, brick, and concrete blocks can be obtained from\r\ndealers or trade associations.\r\n\r\nCommercial tanks are suitable if they embody the essential features\r\ngiven in this bulletin. Capacities should be as recommended in figure\r\n4 for concrete tanks. Proper installation and periodic servicing also\r\nare essential. Tanks badly damaged in handling should not be used.\r\nRapid corrosion of steel tanks will result if the asphalt coating is\r\nimpaired. Minor defects in precast masonry tanks may often be overcome\r\nby plastering the interior with cement mortar.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING A CONCRETE TANK[5]\r\n\r\n[5] For information on making and placing concrete, see Farmers'\r\nBulletin 1772, Use of Concrete on the Farm.\r\n\r\nA convenient method of assuring correct location of the tank is to\r\nbuild a frame as shown in figure 6. Care is necessary to aline it with\r\nthe center line of the inlet and outlet and to level it so that the\r\ndistance from the bottom of the 2 by 4's on the form to the lower edge\r\nof the inlet hole in the form will permit it to be set at the grade of\r\nthe house sewer. This frame is used to support the form for the tank.\r\nTo avoid caving the edges, drive the stakes supporting the frame before\r\nbeginning the excavation. The lumber in the frame can be used later to\r\nmake part of the tank baffles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--Method of outlining a septic-tank excavation\r\non the ground surface.]\r\n\r\nFigure 7 shows how an inside form can be built and hung in place. The\r\ninlet and outlet tees should be carefully set and tied in place before\r\nthe concrete is poured. A single length of pipe should be joined to\r\nthe tee, so that the two can be set in the form as one unit. In most\r\ncases the earth walls of the excavations will serve as the outside\r\nforms unless the soil is sandy or gravelly and the excavation is deeper\r\nthan 5 feet. If outside forms are used, space must also be provided for\r\nthem. Forms should be constructed before the excavation is made and the\r\ntank built as soon as practical, to avoid warping of forms and caving\r\nof earth walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--Inside form hung in place for single-chamber\r\nseptic tank, also a form for casting concrete-slab cover in sections.]\r\n\r\nCounty agricultural agents, local health departments, building-material\r\ndealers, and other agencies often have forms that may be borrowed or\r\nrented.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFLUENT SEWER\r\n\r\nThe effluent sewer should be constructed in similar manner and of the\r\nsame materials as the house sewer and on a slope of 1/8 inch to 1 foot.\r\nThis line, however, may be laid of terra-cotta pipe, as cast-iron is\r\nnot considered necessary except in unusual cases. This line should\r\nalways terminate in a distribution box from which the tile lines\r\nof the disposal field lead away. For steep slopes the arrangement\r\nshown in figure 9 (p. 15) is practical. Joints must be of root-tight\r\nconstruction if the sewer is in the vicinity of trees or shrubs. The\r\nlength of the sewer depends upon the distance from the tank to a safe\r\nsite for the disposal field.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISPOSAL FIELD\r\n\r\nCorrect installation of the disposal field is of great importance for\r\nproper functioning of the septic tank. Therefore, the width, depth,\r\nand spacing of the tile trenches must be carefully selected. Line of\r\n4-inch, open- jointed, agricultural drain tile laid in shallow trenches\r\nare ordinarily used. Perforated fiber drain pipes also may be used and\r\nare obtainable in 4-foot lengths.\r\n\r\nA distribution box with an inlet for the effluent sewer and an outlet\r\nfor each individual run of disposal tile is the best means of dividing\r\nthe flow. The outlet serving a large or double disposal field may be\r\nalternately opened and closed by means of a sewage switch that permits\r\nhalf the disposal field to work and rest alternately several weeks. A\r\nswitch is especially helpful in tight soils but should not be provided\r\nunless proper maintenance is assured, so that a portion of the disposal\r\nfield will not be left to handle the entire load of the system for an\r\nindefinite period. There are many variations of boxes, but figure 8\r\nshows a practical type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--Typical distribution box.]\r\n\r\nShallow Tile Lines\r\n\r\nThe disposal tile should not be more than 18 to 24 inches below the\r\nsurface, and where the ground-water level rises to the bottom of the\r\ntrench special underdrains, described on page 16, are necessary.\r\nSpecial provisions must also be made where tight soils are encountered.\r\nThese methods are described in the section entitled \"Disposal methods\r\nin tight or wet soils.\"\r\n\r\nThe table in figure 9, together with the information given in table 1,\r\nbelow, may be used for estimating the number of tiles needed in any\r\nparticular soil type. If there is any doubt about this requirement, a\r\npercolation test should be made in the disposal field, as follows:\r\n\r\nDig a hole 1-foot square and to the depth at which the tile is to be\r\nlaid. This depth in most instances will be about 24 inches and should\r\nnot exceed 36 inches. Fill the hole with water to a depth of 6 inches\r\nand observe the time required for the water to seep away; divide by 6\r\nto get the average time for the water to fall 1 inch. The test should\r\nbe repeated at three or four different points in the disposal field\r\nand the average time noted for all tests used. The data in table 1 can\r\nthen be used to determine the number of tiles needed. Where 1 hour is\r\nrequired for the water to fall 1 inch the soil is totally unsuitable,\r\nand another site should be selected. Soil conditions at the time of\r\nthe test may vary from year-round average conditions, and this factor\r\nmust be taken into account. If the soil appears exceptionally dry,\r\ngreater depths of water may be used or the test repeated in the same\r\nhole. In no case should tests be made in filled or frozen ground. Where\r\nfissured rock formations are encountered, advice should be sought from\r\nsanitation specialists.\r\n\r\nTable 1.--_Determining tile-disposal field requirements from\r\npercolation tests_[6]\r\n\r\n  ------------+----------------------++------------+---------------------\r\n    Minutes   |  Effective absorption|| Minutes    | Effective absorption\r\n    required  |  area required, per  || required   |  area required, per\r\n  for water to|  person, in bottom   ||for water to|   person, in bottom\r\n  fall 1 inch | of disposal trenches ||fall 1 inch | of disposal trenches\r\n  ------------+----------------------++------------+---------------------\r\n              |    _Square feet_     ||            |   _Square feet_\r\n              |                      ||            |\r\n   2 or less  |          26          ||   10       |        52\r\n              |          30          ||   15       |        63\r\n              |          36          ||   30       |        90\r\n              |          40          ||   60[7]    |       120\r\n  ------------+----------------------++------------+---------------------\r\n\r\n[6] A minimum of 150 square feet should be provided, equal to 100 feet\r\nof 18-inch trench.\r\n\r\n[7] If more than 60 minutes, use special design with seepage pits or\r\nsand-filter trenches.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9 suggests methods of arranging the tiles in disposal fields\r\nunder varying conditions and the length of tiles needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--Arrangements for tile-disposal fields, method\r\nof laying tile, and length of tiles needed.]\r\n\r\n                 SIZE AND MINIMUM SPACING REQUIREMENTS\r\n                         FOR DISPOSAL TRENCHES\r\n      +---------+----------+----------------------+-------------+\r\n      | TRENCH  |  TRENCH  | EFFECTIVE ABSORPTION | TILE LINES  |\r\n      | WIDTH-W |  DEPTH-D | AREA IN SQUARE FEET  | SPACING-S   |\r\n      |IN INCHES| IN INCHES|   PER LINEAL FOOT    |  IN FEET    |\r\n      +---------+----------+----------------------+-------------+\r\n      |   18    | 18 to 30 |        1.5           |    6.0      |\r\n      |   24    | 18 to 30 |        2.0           |    6.0      |\r\n      |   30    | 18 to 36 |        2.5           |    7.5      |\r\n      |   36    | 24 to 36 |        3.0           |    9.0      |\r\n      +---------+----------+----------------------+-------------+\r\n    Wider spacing of the lines desirable where available area permits\r\n\r\n    DISPOSAL-TILE TRENCH\r\n\r\n    Disposal-tile lines--Maximum length for each line 100 feet.\r\n    All lines to be equal in length.\r\n\r\n    Disposal-tile lines to slope 2\" to 4\" per 100 feet, not over 6\".\r\n    Sewer-tile lines to slope 1/8\" to 1/4\" per foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSAL METHODS IN TIGHT OR WET SOILS\r\n\r\nIf the soil is heavy clay or has tight formation, yet shows some\r\nporosity from percolation tests, the efficiency of the field may be\r\nincreased by placing below the tile lines 12 to 15 inches of additional\r\nfilter material (washed gravel, crushed stone, slag, clean cinders, or\r\nclean bank-run gravel 3/4 to 2-1/2 inches in size). When the surface\r\nsoil is tight and is underlain by porous soil, sufficient drainage\r\nis sometimes obtained for the smaller installations by omitting the\r\ntile field and providing a dry well at the end of the effluent sewer,\r\nprovided the water table will not be contaminated. Larger systems under\r\nsuch soil conditions should have a tile field, and absorption can be\r\nincreased by boring 6- or 8-inch holes down to the porous stratum and\r\nfilling them with gravel or sand; the holes should be 4 to 6 feet\r\napart. Another and perhaps the best practice is to excavate the tile\r\ntrenches 4 to 6 feet and install a lower tile line, as shown in figure\r\n10. This latter method is especially desirable if the upper tight\r\nstratum is especially thick, or if there is no porous lower stratum, or\r\nif in irrigated regions and where the disposal field is limited in area.\r\n\r\nWhere the underdrain tile is not used, the absorption capacity of the\r\nfield can be increased by providing a rock-filled trench across the\r\nlower end of the tiles for the full width of the field. The depth\r\nshould be not less than 5 feet and the width not less than 3 feet.\r\n\r\nOn account of the beneficial action of bacteria in the upper soil\r\nlayers it is highly desirable to confine the effluent near the surface\r\nrather than to use underdrains. Purification becomes slower and less\r\neffective, the deeper the drains.\r\n\r\nIn situations where the soil contains considerable moisture or is even\r\nsaturated, the field may be improved by partially encircling it with a\r\ntile line laid to serve as a drain. Such a line should be on the high\r\nside and have surface outlets for removing the water from the soil. It\r\nshould not be laid so close to a disposal tile line that it will drain\r\nthe sewage effluent from the disposal field onto the surface of the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Slope of disposal tile 2 to 4 inches per 100 feet. Slope\r\nof underdrain tile not less than above.\r\n\r\nPlug upper end of underdrain tile lines, lower end to discharge into\r\nrock-filled seepage pit or into other approved outlet.\r\n\r\nFigure 10.--Filter trench with underdrains.]\r\n\r\nWhen the tile field is underlain by stratified rock or where\r\nunder-drainage is necessary, advice should be sought from the public\r\nhealth authorities, as regulations in some States may not permit the\r\nuse of certain methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE AND MAINTENANCE OF SEPTIC TANKS\r\n\r\nA septic tank when first used does not need starters, such as yeast,\r\nto promote bacterial action. A good septic tank normally requires no\r\nmaintenance other than a yearly inspection and an occasional cleaning.\r\nFrequency of cleaning depends on the capacity of the tank and the\r\nquantity and composition of the sewage. Tanks of the size recommended\r\nin this bulletin may require cleaning at intervals of 3 to 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe tank should be cleaned when 18 to 20 inches of sludge and scum has\r\naccumulated. If a drain has not been provided, sludge may be removed by\r\nbailing or by pumping with a sludge or bilge pump. It is not necessary\r\nto remove the entire liquid contents. Burial in a shallow pit or trench\r\nwith at least 18 to 24 inches of earth cover at a point remote from\r\nwater sources is the most practical method for disposing of these\r\nwastes.\r\n\r\nA septic tank is intended to handle sewage only. Coffee grounds and\r\nground garbage may be included if there is an ample supply of water for\r\nflushing and the tank is cleaned more frequently than would otherwise\r\nbe done. The size of the tank should be increased at least 25 percent\r\nif these materials are included in the sewage.\r\n\r\n  =_Do not use matches or an open flame to inspect a septic tank, as\r\n    the gasses produced by decomposing sewage may explode and cause\r\n    serious injury._=\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF DRAIN SOLVENTS AND OTHER MATERIALS\r\n\r\nSoap, drain solvents, and other mild cleaning or disinfecting solutions\r\nused for normal household purposes cause no trouble in the tank.\r\nConstant use in large quantities, however, and disinfected wastes from\r\nthe sickroom may prove harmful.\r\n\r\nWastes from milk rooms, strong chemicals used in sterilizing equipment\r\nor in photographic work, and the wastes from filters or water softeners\r\nnot only reduce bacterial action but also cause abnormally rapid\r\naccumulations of sludge and clogging of the tile lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION AGAINST FREEZING\r\n\r\nSeptic-tank systems seldom freeze when in constant use. Warm water\r\nand the decomposition of the sewage usually maintain above-freezing\r\ntemperatures. In cold regions there is trouble from freezing if various\r\nparts of the system are not covered adequately. If the system is to be\r\nout of service for a period of time or if exposure is severe, it may be\r\nadvisable to mound over the poorly protected parts of the system with\r\nearth, hay, straw, brush, leaves, manure, snow, or the like.\r\n\r\nIn cold regions it is not advisable to install the entire system below\r\nfrost depth, as this will remove the effluent from the action of the\r\naerobic bacteria in the upper layers of the soil and make the system\r\ngenerally less accessible.\r\n\r\nNew systems put into operation during very cold weather may freeze\r\nunless large quantities of hot water are discharged during the first\r\nfew weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTIC-TANK TROUBLES\r\n\r\nIn sewage disposal, clogging of the disposal field is the most common\r\ntrouble. This may be caused (1) by a tank too small for the volume of\r\nsewage, (2) by failure to clean the tank regularly, (3) by interior\r\narrangement that does not provide slow flow through the tank or that\r\nallows scum or sludge to pass out with the effluent, or (4) by a\r\ndisposal field that is too small or is incorrectly built.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for a clogged disposal field is to dig up and clean the\r\ntiles and re-lay them 3 or 4 feet to one side or the other of their\r\nformer position. Sometimes a tile line can be cleaned by opening up\r\nthe line at each end and flushing it thoroughly with a hose. With this\r\nmethod provision must be made to drain off and safely dispose of the\r\nwater used for flushing.\r\n\r\nTile lines laid with improper slope allow the effluent to collect in a\r\nlimited area and saturate the soil, causing odors. Bacteria cannot work\r\nin such areas, where the soil becomes sour, or \"sewage-sick.\" These\r\nlines must be relaid on the correct slope. Odors or a water-logged soil\r\nmay also indicate that the disposal field is too small.\r\n\r\nHouse sewers frequently clog. This is due, in most cases, to roots\r\nand less frequently to trash, garbage, or other foreign materials\r\ndischarged with the sewage. Greases in the sewer may cause trouble,\r\nespecially when the slope is insufficient to give the sewage a\r\ncleansing velocity. Drain solvents will sometimes remove the\r\nobstruction, but more often it is necessary to clean the sewer by\r\nrodding. In some cases it may be necessary to dig up the line to reach\r\nthe obstruction or, at least, to open the line so that it can be rodded\r\nfrom two directions. When it has been cleaned, a manhole could be built\r\nfor use in case of future trouble. If stoppage is due to roots it may\r\nbe necessary to re-lay the sewer with root-tight joints, or to move\r\neither the sewer or the vegetation so that roots cannot reach the line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREASE TRAPS\r\n\r\n\r\nGrease traps (fig. 11) are not recommended for the average farm,\r\nbecause they clog easily and require frequent cleaning, but they are\r\ndesirable for boarding houses and tourist camps where large quantities\r\nof grease are produced. The septic tank if of proper design and size\r\nwill take care of the normal grease from most farm kitchens.\r\n\r\nThe traps must be several times larger than the quantity of greasy\r\nwater discharged into them at any one time, in order to allow the\r\ngreases to rise, but they should not be of less than 30 gallons'\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nThe trap is best located in an accessible place in the basement or\r\nunder the house close to the source of grease and safe from frost.\r\nOutdoor locations at shallow depths require a covering for insulation\r\nagainst freezing. Grease traps should be connected to the kitchen sink\r\nonly and not to laundry, shower, or water-closet wastes. They must be\r\ncleaned periodically for satisfactory operation, and the outlet should\r\nbe properly trapped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--Typical grease trap.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSAL OF DRAINAGE FROM FIXTURES OTHER THAN TOILETS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the farmhouse does not have an indoor toilet but does have a\r\nkitchen sink or other similar fixtures, the drainage can be disposed\r\nof as shown in figure 12. Even where septic tanks have been installed,\r\nit is sometimes advisable to have a second disposal field for other\r\nfixtures than the toilet, to avoid overloading the tank, especially\r\nwhere large quantities of laundry water are discharged at one time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--Disposal of drainage from kitchen fixtures,\r\nusing a line of terra cotta or fiber drain tile surrounded with\r\ngravel. One or two rock-filled pits at the end of the line increase\r\nthe absorption area and are desirable where there are several fixtures\r\nor the soil is nonporous. The pits may be lined with boards or masonry\r\nlaid without mortar and provided with a tight cover.]\r\n\r\nThese wastes are not likely to create serious health hazards, but they\r\nbecome nuisances if discharged promiscuously on the ground surface.\r\nSuch drainage should never be permitted on the watershed of a spring.\r\n\r\nCoarse sand and gravel, 12 to 18 inches deep, may be placed on the\r\nbottom of the pit, to strain out small particles of solids, which might\r\nclog the pores of the soil. If, after a few years, the sand or gravel\r\nbecomes clogged with solids, it should be replaced with clean materials.\r\n\r\nIf excessive quantities of grease are permitted to enter the sink\r\ndrain, a grease trap may be advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCESSPOOLS\r\n\r\n\r\nCesspools are cheap in first cost but high in maintenance costs and\r\noften become nuisances. They should be located at least 150 feet\r\nfrom wells, 15 feet from seepage pits and property lines, and 20 feet\r\nfrom dwelling foundations. They should never be used in the vicinity\r\nof shallow wells and, in any case, only where permitted by State\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nThe cesspool depends for its action upon seepage into the surrounding\r\nsoil and consequently is particularly unsatisfactory in tight clay\r\nsoils. In more open sand and gravel soils the seepage is reduced as\r\nthe pores of the soil become clogged with particles of solids, until\r\nit stops entirely, and overflowing occurs. Emptying and then cleaning\r\nthe walls and floor of a cesspool do not fully open up the clogged soil\r\npores, and overflowing can be expected to occur soon again.\r\n\r\nSolids in cesspools must be removed from time to time by bailing or\r\npumping and should then be buried 18 to 24 inches deep in a trench\r\nwhere the water supply will not be endangered. Caustic potash (lye)\r\nwill to some extent liquefy solids in a cesspool. This treatment does\r\nnot eliminate the necessity of removing the contents when periodic\r\ninspection shows that the cesspool is nearly full. Caustic potash\r\nconverts the greases into soft soap, whereas caustic soda forms a hard\r\nsoap that does not readily dissolve. The chemical treatment is not\r\neffective in liquefying solids in the pores of the soil surrounding the\r\ncesspool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--A neat, whitewashed lattice along the paved\r\nwalkway provides protection from cold wind and rain and gives added\r\nprivacy.]\r\n\r\nWhen clogging continues and cannot be corrected, in most cases the best\r\nsolution to the problem would be to abandon the cesspool and install\r\na septic-tank system with tile disposal field. The cesspool should be\r\ncompletely filled with stones, earth, or other solid materials to avoid\r\npossible cave-ins.[8]\r\n\r\n[8] See The Septic Tank, p. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIVIES\r\n\r\n\r\nA privy when safely located and properly built and maintained is\r\nsatisfactory for its purpose on the farm. Privies should be built 50\r\nto 150 feet from the farmhouse, preferably on the opposite side of the\r\nhouse from prevailing winds, and at least 50 feet from the well. A site\r\ndownhill from the well is generally safest. In some cases, however,\r\nthe ground water may flow in a direction opposite to the slope of the\r\nsurface, in which case the privy should be built on the other side of\r\nthe well. Direction of flow may sometimes be learned from soil surveys,\r\nwell-driller's data, or other similar sources. A distance of at least 6\r\nfeet from fences or other buildings allows for proper mounding of the\r\nprivy and keeps it away from roof drainage from adjacent buildings.\r\n\r\nGood, tight construction with screened ventilators keeps insects and\r\nbirds from entering, prevents rapid deterioration of the building, and\r\nprovides greater comfort for the user.\r\n\r\nCertain features, while not essential to sanitation and satisfactory\r\nservice, add to personal convenience. A paved walkway, well protected\r\nfrom cold winds and rain, is desirable. A neat, whitewashed lattice, as\r\nshown in figure 13, an arbor covered with vines, or a hedge screen adds\r\nto privacy.\r\n\r\nThe earth-pit privy is the simplest to build and the one most widely\r\nused. It is not generally recommended in localities where underground\r\nrock has crevices.\r\n\r\nFor a sanitary type of privy with reinforced concrete[9] floor, riser,\r\nand supporting sills see figure 14. Because privy units are commonly\r\nused as urinals, the use of impervious materials for risers and\r\nfloors facilitates cleanliness. In the colder climates, wood treated\r\nwith a preservative is durable and reduces the problem of moisture\r\ncondensation. Therefore, wood could be used if approved by the State\r\ndepartment of health.\r\n\r\n[9] For information on making concrete see Farmers' Bulletin 1772, Use\r\nof Concrete on the Farm.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered impracticable to build the slab and riser\r\nof concrete, these parts may be of wood, as shown in figure 16.\r\nThe building itself may be as shown in either illustration. A wood\r\nstructure is easy to move to a new location.\r\n\r\nA pit with a minimum capacity of 50 cubic feet[10] will usually serve\r\nfive people over a period of 5 to 10 years. The privy should be moved\r\nwhen the pit is filled to within 18 or 20 inches of the top and a\r\nstrong disinfectant spread in the old pit before covering it with earth.\r\n\r\n[10] Recommended by the Committee on Promotion of Rural Sanitation,\r\nPublic Health Engineering Section of the American Public Health\r\nAssociation, 1932.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--Sanitary type of privy. Detailed plans and\r\na bill of materials for this design can be had from the United States\r\nPublic Health Service, Washington 25, D. C.]\r\n\r\nIt is important to have the earth-pit privy more than 50 feet from the\r\nwell even where the water table is not near the surface. The ground\r\nwater should flow from the well toward the privy, and it is important\r\nthat this direction of flow be determined in advance.\r\n\r\nWood is most commonly employed for the main part of the building. The\r\nground outside should be sloped as shown, to shed water away from the\r\nbuilding, and the roof should extend beyond the walls to shed water\r\naway from the pit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE AND MAINTENANCE\r\n\r\nAll privies require periodic attention. Seats and covers should be\r\nwashed weekly with soap and water or with disinfectants, such as\r\ncresol, pine oil, and hypochlorite or chloride of lime. These have\r\ndeodorant properties and are available at most grocery or drug stores.\r\nDruggists generally carry a more refined product and consequently the\r\nprice is higher.\r\n\r\nDuring the fly season fly and mosquito eggs will be destroyed by\r\npouring half a pint of crude oil, crankcase oil, fuel oil, kerosene, or\r\nborax solution (1 pound powdered borax dissolved in about 10 gallons of\r\nwater) over the contents of the pit about once a week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--Pit privy of all-wood construction. The\r\nsills and riser of this type should either be treated or made of\r\ncypress, redwood, cedar, locust, fir, or other decay-resistant wood.]\r\n\r\nOdors from privy pits and vaults can be reduced by covering the\r\ncontents with dry earth, ashes, manure, or sawdust. These materials\r\nfill up the pit rather quickly, but can be used where other deodorants\r\nare not available. Sometimes two cakes of yeast dissolved in 2 gallons\r\nof water are effective in reducing odors. Commercial deodorants are\r\navailable from suppliers of disinfectants.\r\n\r\nIf a person in the family has typhoid fever or is a carrier of that\r\ndisease or has dysentery, it is advisable to disinfect the excreta.\r\nFire, live steam, boiling water, and such chemicals as caustic\r\nsoda (sodium hydroxide), caustic potash (potassium hydroxide), or\r\nhypochlorite or chloride of lime may be used. The heat generated by the\r\nslacking of quicklime is also effective. Best results are obtained if\r\nthe infected material is treated prior to depositing it in the privy.\r\nFurther advice may be obtained from physicians, local health officers,\r\nor State health departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL CLOSETS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, chemical closets should be used only where there are\r\nelderly or infirm people unable to get outdoors, particularly in\r\nwinter-time. In some localities their use is forbidden by law because\r\nof improper maintenance. Strict adherence to the manufacturer's\r\ndirections for making the installation is necessary to obtain\r\nsatisfactory service. The chief advantage of chemical closets is that\r\nthey may be within or adjoining the house and used without regard\r\nto soil or ground-water conditions. The caustic chemicals required,\r\nif used properly, reduce the quantity of solid matter by liquefying\r\naction, disinfect and deodorize the contents, and lessen danger from\r\nflies. Disadvantages are the cost of the chemicals and necessity for\r\ncareful and constant maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe chemical-tank closet is generally recommended rather than the\r\ndry-type chemical closet. Three variations of tanks are available\r\ncommercially. One type contains a clean-out opening in the top of the\r\ntank, through which the contents are removed by pumping or bailing.\r\nThe second type has, in addition to a clean-out opening, a drain valve\r\nat the bottom, which is operated by a handle extending to a clean-out\r\nopening, so that gravity drainage of the tank is possible. The third\r\ntype is self-draining; as the excreta are added an equal volume of\r\nliquid is spilled out the overflow. The solid matter must be removed\r\nmanually or through the sludge drain.\r\n\r\nThe last-mentioned type requires frequent addition of chemicals, and\r\nthe others are recharged after each emptying. The presence of odor is\r\nan indication of insufficient chemical or of the need for emptying\r\nand recharging. The same precautions apply to selecting an area for\r\ndisposing of the tank wastes as to disposing of the materials removed\r\nfrom cesspools.[11] Since the contents of chemical closets are caustic,\r\nthey may kill vegetation with which they come in contact.\r\n\r\n[11] For disposal methods in tight soils, see p. 16.\r\n\r\nThe dry-type chemical closet is cheap, simple, and easy to install\r\nbut requires frequent emptying. Pine tar and coal tar will accomplish\r\nonly partial disinfection and deodorization, but caustic disinfectants\r\nproduce liquefication in addition if used in sufficient quantities.\r\nThe caustic chemicals may cause burns if the receptacle is too full or\r\nif spilled where they come in contact with the body.\r\n\r\nThis form of closet is more of an expedient than a permanent\r\ninstallation, and daily care is necessary to prevent the development of\r\ninsanitary conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSAL OF GARBAGE AND TRASH\r\n\r\n\r\nDomestic garbage and trash on farms can be divided into four\r\nclasses--(1) waste of plant or animal origin suitable for animal feed,\r\n(2) unpalatable plant or animal waste, (3) combustible trash, and (4)\r\nnoncombustible material. The disposal of these wastes is simplified if\r\nthe four classes are kept separate.\r\n\r\nTrash to be burned should be kept dry. Coffee grounds, tea leaves,\r\ncitrus rinds, fish heads, entrails, eggshells, and similar material are\r\nmost readily handled if drained and put in paper sacks.\r\n\r\nCans should be placed where they will not collect water and become\r\nbreeding places for mosquitoes. Cans will corrode faster if heated\r\nsufficiently to burn off all grease. When the trash accumulates it\r\nshould be hauled to some out-of-the-way place, such as a gully, or\r\nburied.\r\n\r\nNeat-appearing garbage containers are desirable for kitchen use and\r\nshould be small enough to require daily emptying. Large containers\r\nmay be placed within easy reach outside the house and screened with a\r\nlattice fence or shrubbery. Substantial containers of rust-resistant\r\nmetal will not quickly become an eyesore and a nuisance. Tight covers\r\nshould be used to keep out prowling animals and to eliminate the habit\r\nof tossing wastes from the back door. Open or wooden containers are not\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nA good way to protect the garbage pail is to place it in a small pit\r\nthat has a manhole frame and a lid that can be raised by foot pedal. A\r\ngravel bottom in the pit will assist in draining water away.\r\n\r\nOutdoor receptacles, if emptied and cleaned once a week, generally do\r\nnot become foul. Grease, coffee grounds, and other similar materials\r\nthat adhere to the sides of containers can be removed by scraping with\r\na little sand prior to scalding.\r\n\r\nElectrically operated units grind garbage and bones and discharge the\r\nmaterial through the kitchen-sink drain. They will not handle tin cans,\r\nglass, and the like. They may be used on farms if the septic tank is\r\nlarger than normal and if sufficient water is available for flushing\r\nthe drain to prevent clogging.\r\n\r\nGarbage to be fed to animals should be preserved as carefully as is\r\nhuman food. To prevent the spread of trichinosis and other diseases, it\r\nshould be cooked before it is fed to hogs. Garbage left uneaten by the\r\nanimals should be disposed of by one of the methods described above.\r\n\r\nIncineration is the most sanitary method of disposing of farm wastes.\r\nGarbage, however, is not easily burned. Figure 16 shows a type of\r\nincinerator[12] suitable for farm homes. Details of construction for\r\na brick incinerator are given in figure 17. Brick, stone, concrete,\r\nor other fire-resistant material may be used. Commercial incinerators,\r\nsome of which are designed to be built into the house, also are\r\navailable, although these cost considerably more than the home-made\r\ntype shown.\r\n\r\n[12] Blueprints of this design may be obtained from the extension\r\nagricultural engineers at most of the State colleges.\r\n\r\nA limited quantity of refuse may be burned in a kitchen range or a\r\nfurnace, but it may cause accumulations of grease in the flue and\r\nrequire frequent cleaning to prevent fire.\r\n\r\nNext to burning, burial is the most desirable method of waste disposal.\r\nWaste material may be deposited in a trench 3 or 4 feet wide, 7 or 8\r\nfeet long, and 4 or 5 feet deep and covered with earth when filled to\r\nwithin 18 inches of the top. If there is no fire hazard, the contents\r\nof the trench may be burned.\r\n\r\nGarbage may be included in a compost heap with leaves, peat, manure,\r\nand similar materials. The compost pile should be in an inconspicuous\r\nplace, built up to the desired height with materials that will rot,\r\nand then covered with 2 or 3 inches of earth. The top should be\r\nlevel and the sides steep sloping. It is necessary that the material\r\nbeing composted be kept moist; otherwise it will not rot. Frequently\r\ncommercial fertilizer is added to increase the fertilizing value of the\r\ncompost.\r\n\r\nAshes and clinkers removed from furnaces should be placed in metal\r\ncontainers to eliminate fire hazard. Wood ashes may be spread on the\r\nlawn or garden, as they have some fertilizing value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--A satisfactory incinerator for household\r\nuse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--Details of construction of the household\r\nincinerator pictured in figure 16.]\r\n\r\nTrash burners of various designs suitable for burning small quantities\r\nof paper and rags are available or may be improvised. The main\r\nrequirements are provision for adequate draft and for preventing the\r\nescape of burning paper or live embers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU. S.
