The field of work\r\nis a very extensive one, and I feel that this account provides a record\r\ninadequate to our endeavours. However, I am comforted by the fact that\r\nthe lasting reputation of the Expedition is founded upon the scientific\r\nvolumes which will appear in due course.\r\n\r\nAllusion to the history of Antarctic exploration has been reduced to a\r\nminimum, as the subject has been ably dealt with by previous writers.\r\nThis, and several other aspects of our subject, have been relegated\r\nto special appendices in order to make the story more readable and\r\nself-contained.\r\n\r\nA glossary of technicalities is introduced for readers not familiar with\r\nthe terms. In the same place is given a list of animals referred to from\r\ntime to time. There, the common name is placed against the scientific\r\nname, so rendering it unnecessary to repeat the latter in the text.\r\n\r\nThe reports handed to me by the leaders concerning the work of sledging\r\njourneys and of the respective bases were in the main clearly and\r\npopularly written. Still it was necessary to make extensive excisions so\r\nas to preserve a \"balance\" of justice in all the accounts, and to keep\r\nthe narrative within limits. I wish to assure the various authors of my\r\nappreciation of their contributions.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Hurley's artistic taste is apparent in the numerous\r\nphotographs. We who knew the circumstances can warmly testify to his\r\nperseverance under conditions of exceptional difficulty. Mr. A. J.\r\nHodgeman is responsible for the cartographical work, which occupied\r\nhis time for many months. Other members of the Expedition have\r\nadded treasures to our collection of illustrations; each of which is\r\nacknowledged in its place.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. A. L. McLean, who assisted me in writing and editing the book, I\r\nam very greatly indebted. To him the book owes any literary style it may\r\npossess. Dr. McLean's journalistic talent was discovered by me when he\r\noccupied the post of Editor of the 'Adelie Blizzard', a monthly volume\r\nwhich helped to relieve the monotony of our second year in Adelie\r\nLand. For months he was constantly at work, revising cutting down or\r\namplifying the material of the story.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish to express my thanks to Dr. Hugh Robert Mill for hints\r\nand criticisms by which we have profited.\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS MAWSON\r\n\r\nLondon, Autumn 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Nor on thee yet\r\n     Shall burst the future, as successive zones\r\n     Of several wonder open on some spirit\r\n     Flying secure and glad from heaven to heaven.\r\n                                          BROWNING\r\n\r\nThe aim of geographical exploration has, in these days, interfused with\r\nthe passion for truth. If now the ultimate bounds of knowledge have\r\nbroadened to the infinite, the spirit of the man of science has\r\nquickened to a deeper fervour. Amid the finished ingenuities of\r\nthe laboratory he has knitted a spiritual entente with the moral\r\nphilosopher, viewing:\r\n\r\n    The narrow creeds of right and wrong, which fade\r\n    Before the unmeasured thirst for good.\r\n\r\nScience and exploration have never been at variance; rather, the desire\r\nfor the pure elements of natural revelation lay at the source of that\r\nunquenchable power the \"love of adventure.\"\r\n\r\nOf whatever nationality the explorer was always emboldened by that\r\nimpulse, and, if there ever be a future of decadence, it will live again\r\nin his ungovernable heritage.\r\n\r\nEric the Red; Francis Drake--the same ardour was kindled at the heart of\r\neither. It is a far cry from the latter, a born marauder, to the modern\r\nscientific explorer. Still Drake was a hero of many parts, and though\r\na religious bigot in present acceptation, was one of the enlightened of\r\nhis age. A man who moved an equal in a court of Elizabethan manners was\r\nnot untouched by the glorious ideals of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nYet it was the unswerving will of a Columbus, a Vasco da Gama or a\r\nMagellan which created the devotion to geographical discovery, per se,\r\nand made practicable the concept of a spherical earth. The world was\r\nopened in imaginative entirety, and it now remained for the geographer\r\nto fill in the details brought home by the navigator.\r\n\r\nIt was long before Thule the wondrous ice-land of the North yielded her\r\nfirst secrets, and longer ere the Terra Australis of Finne was laid bare\r\nto the prying eyes of Science.\r\n\r\nEarly Arctic navigation opened the bounds of the unknown in a haphazard\r\nand fortuitous fashion. Sealers and whalers in the hope of rich booty\r\nventured far afield, and, ranging among the mysterious floes or riding\r\nout fierce gales off an ice-girt coast, brought back strange tales to\r\na curious world. Crudely embellished, contradictory, yet alluring they\r\nwere; but the demand for truth came surely to the rescue. Thus, it was\r\noften the whaler who forsook his trade to explore for mere exploration's\r\nsake. Baffin was one of those who opened the gates to the North.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the commercial spirit of the generations who sought a North\r\nWest Passage was responsible for the incursions of many adventurers into\r\nthe new world of the ice.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, the South was first attacked in the true scientific\r\nspirit by Captain Cook and later by Bellingshausen. Sealing and whaling\r\nventures followed in their train.\r\n\r\nAt last the era had come for the expedition, planned, administered,\r\nequipped and carried out with a definite objective. It is characteristic\r\nof the race of men that the first design should have centred on the\r\nPole--the top of the earth, the focus of longitude, the magic goal, to\r\nreach which no physical sacrifice was too great. The heroism of Parry\r\nis a type of that adamant persistence which has made the history of the\r\nconquest of the Poles a volume in which disaster and death have played\r\na large part. It followed on years of polar experience, it resulted from\r\nan exact knowledge of geographical and climatic conditions, a fearless\r\nanticipation, expert information on the details of transport--and the\r\nfortune of the brave--that Peary and Amundsen had their reward in the\r\npresent generation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the wake of the pioneers of new land there were passing\r\nthe scientific workers born in the early nineteenth century. Sir James\r\nClark Ross is an epitome of that expansive enthusiasm which was the\r\nkeynote of the life of Charles Darwin. The classic \"Voyage of the\r\nBeagle\" (1831-36) was a triumph of patient rigorous investigation\r\nconducted in many lands outside the polar circles.\r\n\r\nThe methods of Darwin were developed in the 'Challenger' Expedition\r\n(1872) which worked even to the confines of the southern ice. And\r\nthe torch of the pure flame of Science was handed on. It was the same\r\nconsuming ardour which took Nansen across the plateau of Greenland,\r\nwhich made him resolutely propound the theory of the northern ice-drift,\r\nto maintain it in the face of opposition and ridicule and to plan an\r\nexpedition down to the minutest detail in conformity therewith. The\r\nclose of the century saw Science no longer the mere appendage but the\r\nactual basis of exploratory endeavour.\r\n\r\nDisinterested research and unselfish specialization are the phrases born\r\nto meet the intellectual demands of the new century.\r\n\r\nThe modern polar expedition goes forth with finished appliances, with\r\nexperts in every department--sailors, artisans, soldiers and students\r\nin medley; supremely, with men who seek risk and privation--the glory of\r\nthe dauntless past. A.L.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the oft-repeated questions for which I usually had a ready\r\nanswer, at the conclusion of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Expedition\r\n(1907-09) was, \"Would you like to go to the Antarctic again?\" In the\r\nfirst flush of the welcome home and for many months, during which the\r\nkeen edge of pleasure under civilized conditions had not entirely worn\r\naway, I was inclined to reply with a somewhat emphatic negative. But,\r\nonce more a man in the world of men, lulled in the easy repose of\r\nroutine, and performing the ordinary duties of a workaday world,\r\nold emotions awakened. The grand sweet days returned in irresistible\r\nglamour, faraway \"voices\" called:\r\n\r\n  ...from the wilderness, the vast and Godlike spaces,\r\n    The stark and sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole.\r\n\r\nThere always seemed to be something at the back of my mind, stored\r\naway for future contemplation, and it was an idea which largely matured\r\nduring my first sojourn in the far South. At times, during the long\r\nhours of steady tramping across the trackless snow-fields, one's\r\nthoughts flow in a clear and limpid stream, the mind is unruffled and\r\ncomposed and the passion of a great venture springing suddenly before\r\nthe imagination is sobered by the calmness of pure reason. Perchance\r\nthis is true of certain moments, but they are rare and fleeting. It may\r\nhave been in one such phase that I suddenly found myself eager for more\r\nthan a glimpse of the great span of Antarctic coast lying nearest to\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nProfessor T. W. E. David, Dr. F. A. Mackay and I, when seeking the South\r\nMagnetic Pole during the summer of 1908-09, had penetrated farthest into\r\nthat region on land. The limiting outposts had been defined by other\r\nexpeditions; at Cape Adare on the east and at Gaussberg on the west.\r\nBetween them lay my \"Land of Hope and Glory,\" of whose outline and\r\nglacial features the barest evidence had been furnished. There,\r\nbordering the Antarctic Circle, was a realm far from the well-sailed\r\nhighways of many of the more recent Antarctic expeditions.\r\n\r\nThe idea of exploring this unknown coast took firm root in my mind\r\nwhile I was on a visit to Europe in February 1910. The prospects of an\r\nexpedition operating to the west of Cape Adare were discussed with the\r\nlate Captain R. F. Scott and I suggested that the activities of his\r\nexpedition might be arranged to extend over the area in question.\r\nFinally he decided that his hands were already too full to make any\r\ndefinite proposition for a region so remote from his own objective.\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Shackleton was warmly enthusiastic when the scheme was laid\r\nbefore him, hoping for a time to identify himself with the undertaking.\r\nIt was in some measure due to his initiative that I felt impelled\r\neventually to undertake the organization and leadership of an\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons, besides the fact that it was the country of my home\r\nand Alma Mater, I was desirous that the Expedition should be maintained\r\nby Australia. It seemed to me that here was an opportunity to prove that\r\nthe young men of a young country could rise to those traditions which\r\nhave made the history of British Polar exploration one of triumphant\r\nendeavour as well as of tragic sacrifice. And so I was privileged to\r\nrally the \"sons of the younger son.\"\r\n\r\nA provisional plan was drafted and put before the Australasian\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science at their meeting held at\r\nSydney in January 1911, with a request for approval and financial\r\nassistance. Both were unanimously granted, a sum of L1000 was voted and\r\ncommittees were formed to co-operate in the arrangement of a scientific\r\nprogramme and to approach the Government with a view to obtaining\r\nsubstantial help.\r\n\r\nThe three leading members of the committees were Professor Orme Masson\r\n(President), Professor T. W. Edgeworth David (President Elect) and\r\nProfessor G. C. Henderson (President of the Geographical Section). All\r\nwere zealous and active in furthering the projects of the Expedition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had laid my scheme of work before certain prominent\r\nAustralians and some large donations** had been promised. The sympathy\r\nand warm-hearted generosity of these gentlemen was an incentive for me\r\nto push through my plans at once to a successful issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** Refer to Finance Appendix.\r\n\r\nI therefore left immediately for London with a view to making\r\narrangements there for a vessel suitable for polar exploration, to\r\nsecure sledging dogs from Greenland and furs from Norway, and to order\r\nthe construction of certain instruments and equipment. It was also my\r\nintention to gain if possible the support of Australians residing in\r\nLondon. The Council of the University of Adelaide, in a broad-minded\r\nscientific spirit, granted me the necessary leave of absence from my\r\npost as lecturer, to carry through what had now resolved itself into an\r\nextensive and prolonged enterprise.\r\n\r\nDuring my absence, a Committee of the Australasian Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science approached the Commonwealth Government with an\r\nappeal for funds. Unfortunately it was the year (1911) of the Coronation\r\nof his Majesty King George V, and the leading members of the Cabinet\r\nwere in England, so the final answer to the deputation was postponed. I\r\nwas thus in a position of some difficulty, for many requirements had\r\nto be ordered without delay if the Expedition were to get away from\r\nAustralia before the end of the year.\r\n\r\nAt length, through the kindness of Lord Northcliffe, the columns of the\r\nDaily Mail were opened to us and Sir Ernest Shackleton made a strong\r\nappeal on our behalf. The Royal Geographical Society set the seal of\r\nits approval on the aims of the Expedition and many donations were soon\r\nafterwards received.\r\n\r\nAt this rather critical period I was fortunate in securing the services\r\nof Captain John King Davis, who was in future to act as Master of the\r\nvessel and Second in Command of the Expedition. He joined me in April\r\n1911, and rendered valuable help in the preliminary arrangements. Under\r\nhis direction the s.y. Aurora was purchased and refitted.\r\n\r\nThe few months spent in London were anxious and trying, but the memory\r\nof them is pleasantly relieved by the generosity and assistance which\r\nwere meted out on every hand. Sir George Reid, High Commissioner for\r\nthe Australian Commonwealth, I shall always remember as an ever-present\r\nfriend. The preparations for the scientific programme received a strong\r\nimpetus from well-known Antarctic explorers, notably Dr. W. S. Bruce,\r\nDr. Jean Charcot, Captain Adrian de Gerlache, and the late Sir John\r\nMurray and Mr. J. Y. Buchanan of the Challenger Expedition. In the\r\ndispositions made for oceanographical work I was indebted for liberal\r\nsupport to H.S.H. the Prince of Monaco.\r\n\r\nIn July 1911 I was once more in Australia, a large proportion of my time\r\nbeing occupied with finance, the purchase and concentration of stores\r\nand equipment and the appointment of the staff. In this work I was aided\r\nby Professors Masson and David and by Miss Ethel Bage, who throughout\r\nthis busy period acted in an honorary capacity as secretary in\r\nMelbourne.\r\n\r\nTime was drawing on and the funds of the Expedition were wholly\r\ninadequate to the needs of the moment, until Mr. T. H. Smeaton, M.P.,\r\nintroduced a deputation to the Hon. John Verran, Premier of South\r\nAustralia. The deputation, organized to approach the State Government\r\nfor a grant of L5000, was led by the Right Hon. Sir Samuel Way,\r\nBart., Chief Justice of South Australia and Chancellor of the Adelaide\r\nUniversity, and supported by Mr. Lavington Bonython, Mayor of Adelaide,\r\nT. Ryan, M.P., the Presidents of several scientific societies and\r\nmembers of the University staff. This sum was eventually forthcoming and\r\nit paved the way to greater things.\r\n\r\nIn Sydney, Professor David approached the State Government on behalf of\r\nthe Expedition for financial support, and, through the Acting Premier,\r\nthe Hon. W. A. Holman, L7000 was generously promised. The State of\r\nVictoria through the Hon. W. Watt, Premier of Victoria, supplemented our\r\nfunds to the extent of L6000.\r\n\r\nUpheld by the prestige of a large meeting convened in the Melbourne\r\nTown Hall during the spring, the objects of the Australasian Antarctic\r\nExpedition were more widely published. On that memorable occasion the\r\nGovernor-General, Lord Denman, acted as chairman, and among others\r\nwho participated were the Hon. Andrew Fisher (Prime Minister of the\r\nCommonwealth), the Hon. Alfred Deakin (Leader of the Opposition),\r\nProfessor Orme Masson (President A.A.A.S. and representative of\r\nVictoria), Senator Walker (representing New South Wales) and Professor\r\nG. C. Henderson (representing South Australia).\r\n\r\nSoon after this meeting the Commonwealth Government voted L5000,\r\nfollowing a grant of L2000 made by the British Government at the\r\ninstance of Lord Denman, who from the outset had been a staunch friend\r\nof the Expedition.\r\n\r\nAt the end of October 1911 all immediate financial anxiety had\r\npassed, and I was able to devote myself with confidence to the final\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis brought the 'Aurora' from England to Australia, and on\r\nDecember 2, 1911, we left Hobart for the South. A base was established\r\non Macquarie Island, after which the ship pushed through the ice and\r\nlanded a party on an undiscovered portion of the Antarctic Continent.\r\nAfter a journey of fifteen hundred miles to the west of this base\r\nanother party was landed and then the Aurora returned to Hobart to refit\r\nand to carry out oceanographical investigations, during the year 1912,\r\nin the waters south of Australia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn December 1912 Captain Davis revisited the Antarctic to relieve the\r\ntwo parties who had wintered there. A calamity befell my own sledging\r\nparty, Lieut. B. E. S. Ninnis and Dr. X. Mertz both lost their lives\r\nand my arrival back at Winter Quarters was delayed for so long, that the\r\n'Aurora' was forced to leave five men for another year to prosecute a\r\nsearch for the missing party. The remainder of the men, ten in number,\r\nand the party fifteen hundred miles to the west were landed safely at\r\nHobart in March 1912.\r\n\r\nThus the prearranged plans were upset by my non-return and the\r\nadministration of the Expedition in Australia was carried out by\r\nProfessor David, whose special knowledge was invaluable at such a\r\njuncture.\r\n\r\nFunds were once more required, and, during the summer of 1912,\r\nCaptain Davis visited London and secured additional support, while\r\nthe Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science again\r\nsuccessfully approached the Commonwealth Government (The Right Hon. J.\r\nH. Cook, Prime Minister). In all, the sum of L8000 was raised to meet\r\nthe demands of a second voyage of relief.\r\n\r\nThe party left on Macquarie Island, who had agreed to remain at the\r\nstation for another year, ran short of food during their second winter.\r\nThe New Zealand Government rendered the Expedition a great service in\r\ndispatching stores to them by the 'Tutanekai' without delay.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the summer of 1913, the 'Aurora' set out on her third cruise\r\nto the far South, picking up the parties at Macquarie Island and in\r\nthe Antarctic, carried out observations for two months amid the ice and\r\nreached Adelaide late in February 1914.\r\n\r\nThroughout a period of more than three years Professors David and\r\nMasson--the fathers of the Expedition--worked indefatigably and\r\nunselfishly in its interests. Unbeknown to them I have taken the liberty\r\nto reproduce the only photographs at hand of these gentlemen, which\r\naction I hope they will view favourably. That of Professor David needs\r\nsome explanation: It is a snapshot taken at Relief Inlet, South Victoria\r\nLand, at the moment when the Northern Party of Shackleton's Expedition,\r\nFebruary 1909, was rescued by the S.Y. 'Nimrod'.\r\n\r\nIn shipping arrangements Capt. Davis was assisted throughout by Mr.\r\nJ. J. Kinsey, Christchurch, Capt. Barter, Sydney, and Mr. F. Hammond,\r\nHobart.\r\n\r\nSuch an undertaking is the work of a multitude and it is only by\r\nsympathetic support from many sources that a measure of success can be\r\nexpected. In this connexion there are many names which I recall with\r\nwarm gratitude. It is impossible to mention all to whom the Expedition\r\nis indebted, but I trust that none of those who have taken a prominent\r\npart will fail to find an acknowledgment somewhere in these volumes.\r\n\r\nI should specially mention the friendly help afforded by the\r\nAustralasian Press, which has at all times given the Expedition\r\nfavourable and lengthy notices, insisting on its national and scientific\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the conduct of the work itself, I was seconded by the\r\nwhole-hearted co-operation of the members, my comrades, and what they\r\nhave done can only be indicated in this narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I THE PROBLEM AND PREPARATIONS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II THE LAST DAYS AT HOBART AND THE VOYAGE TO\r\n             MACQUARIE ISLAND\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III FROM MACQUARIE ISLAND TO ADELIE LAND\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV NEW LANDS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V FIRST DAYS IN ADELIE LAND\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI AUTUMN PROSPECTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII THE BLIZZARD\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII DOMESTIC LIFE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX MIDWINTER AND ITS WORK\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X THE PREPARATION OF SLEDGING EQUIPMENT 176\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI SPRING EXPLOITS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII ACROSS KING GEORGE V LAND\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII TOIL AND TRIBULATION\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV THE QUEST OF THE SOUTH MAGNETIC POLE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV EASTWARD OVER THE SEA-ICE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI HORN BLUFF AND PENGUIN POINT\r\n\r\n[VOLUME II]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII WITH STILLWELL'S AND BICKERTON'S PARTIES\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII THE SHIP'S STORY.

With three other Antarctic\r\nexpeditions already in the field, it appeared to many, therefore, that\r\nthe venture was entirely superfluous.\r\n\r\nThe Expedition had a problem sketched in unmistakable feature, and\r\nthe following pages will shortly set forth its historical origin and\r\nrationale.\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic problem** assumed its modern aspect after Captain Cook's\r\ncircumnavigation of the globe in high southern latitudes, accomplished\r\nbetween 1772 and 1775. Fact replaced the fiction and surmise of former\r\ntimes, and maps appeared showing a large blank area at the southern\r\nextremity of the earth, where speculative cartographers had affirmed the\r\nexistence of habitable land extending far towards the Equator. Cook's\r\nvoyage made it clear that if there were any considerable mass of\r\nAntarctic land, it must indubitably lie within the Antarctic Circle, and\r\nbe subjected to such stringent climatic conditions as to render it an\r\nunlikely habitation for man.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** Dr. H. R. Mill has compiled a complete account of Antarctic\r\nexploration in his \"Siege of the South Pole.\" Refer also to the\r\nHistorical Appendix for an abridged statement.\r\n\r\nCook's reports of seals on the island of South Georgia initiated in the\r\nAntarctic seas south of America a commercial enterprise, which is still\r\ncarried on, and has incidentally thrown much light upon the geography of\r\nthe South Polar regions. Indeed, almost the whole of such information,\r\nprior to the year 1839, was the outcome of sealing and whaling projects.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1840, a wave of scientific enthusiasm resulted in the\r\ndispatch of three national expeditions by France, the United States,\r\nand Great Britain; part at least of whose programmes was Antarctic\r\nexploration. Russia had previously sent out an expedition which had made\r\nnotable discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe contributions to knowledge gained at this period were considerable.\r\nThose carried back to civilization by the British expedition under Ross,\r\nare so well known that they need not be described. The French under\r\nDumont D'Urville and the Americans under Wilkes visited the region to\r\nthe southward of Australia--the arena of our own efforts--and frequent\r\nreferences will be made to their work throughout this story.\r\n\r\nWhat has been termed the period of averted interest now intervened,\r\nbefore the modern movement set in with overpowering insistence. It\r\nwas not till 1897 that it had commenced in earnest. Since then many\r\nadventurers have gone forth; most of the prominent civilized nations\r\ntaking their share in exploration. By their joint efforts some, at\r\nleast, of the mystery of Antarctica has been dispelled.\r\n\r\nIt is now a commonplace, largely in the world of geographical concerns,\r\nthat the earth has still another continent, unique in character, whose\r\nultimate bounds are merely pieced together from a fragmentary outline.\r\nThe Continent itself appears to have been sighted for the first time in\r\nthe year 1820, but no human being actually set foot on it until 1895.\r\nThe Belgian expedition under de Gerlache was the first to experience the\r\nAntarctic winter, spending the year 1898 drifting helplessly, frozen\r\nin the pack-ice, to the southward of America. In the following year a\r\nBritish expedition under Borchgrevinck, wintering at Cape Adare, passed\r\na year upon the Antarctic mainland.\r\n\r\nThe main efforts of recent years have been centred upon the two more\r\naccessible areas, namely, that in the American Quadrant** which is\r\nprolonged as a tongue of land outside the Antarctic Circle, being\r\nconsequently less beset by ice; secondly, the vicinity of the Ross Sea\r\nin the Australian Quadrant. It is because these two favoured domains\r\nhave for special reasons attracted the stream of exploration that\r\nthe major portion of Antarctica is unknown. Nevertheless, one is in a\r\nposition to sketch broad features which will probably not be radically\r\naltered by any future expeditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** For convenience, the Antarctic regions may be referred to in four\r\nmain divisions, corresponding with the quadrants of the hemisphere. Of\r\nthe several suggestions thrown out by previous writers, the one adopted\r\nhere is that based on the meridian of Greenwich, referring the quadrants\r\nto an adjacent continent or ocean. Thus the American Quadrant lies\r\nbetween 0 degrees and 90 degrees W., the African Quadrant between\r\n0 degrees and 90 degrees E., and the Australian Quadrant between 90\r\ndegrees and 180 degrees E. The fourth division is called the Pacific\r\nQuadrant, since ocean alone lies to the north of it.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that a continent approaching the combined areas of\r\nAustralia and Europe lies more or less buried beneath the South Polar\r\nsnows; though any statement of the precise area is insufficient for a\r\nproper appreciation of the magnitude, unless its elevated plateau-like\r\ncharacter be also taken into consideration. It appears to be highest\r\nover a wide central crown rising to more than ten thousand feet. Of the\r\nremainder, there is little doubt that the major portion stands as high\r\nas six thousand feet. The average elevation must far exceed that of any\r\nother continent, for, with peaks nineteen thousand feet above sea-level,\r\nits mountainous topography is remarkable. Along the coast of Victoria\r\nLand, in the Australian Quadrant, are some of the most majestic vistas\r\nof alpine scenery that the world affords. Rock exposures are rare, ice\r\nappearing everywhere except in the most favoured places.\r\n\r\nRegarding plant and animal life upon the land there is little to say.\r\nThe vegetable kingdom is represented by plants of low organization such\r\nas mosses, lichens, diatoms and algae. The animal world, so far as true\r\nland-forms are concerned, is limited to types like the protozoa (lowest\r\nin the organic scale), rotifera and minute insect-like mites which lurk\r\nhidden away amongst the tufts of moss or on the under side of loose\r\nstones. Bacteria, most fundamental of all, at the basis, so to speak, of\r\nanimal and vegetable life, have a manifold distribution.\r\n\r\nIt is a very different matter when we turn to the life of the\r\nneighbouring seas, for that vies in abundance with the warmer waters\r\nof lower latitudes. There are innumerable seals, many sea-birds and\r\nmillions of penguins. As all these breed on Antarctic shores, the\r\ncoastal margin of the continent is not so desolate.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that life, including land-mammals, is abundant in\r\nthe North Polar regions, it may be asked why analogous forms are not\r\nbetter represented in corresponding southern latitudes. Without going\r\ntoo deeply into the question, it may be briefly stated, firstly, that a\r\nmore widespread glaciation than at present prevails invested the great\r\nsouthern continent and its environing seas, within recent geological\r\ntimes, effectually exterminating any pre-existing land life. Secondly,\r\nsince that period the continent has been isolated by a wide belt of\r\nocean from other lands, from which restocking might have taken\r\nplace after the manner of the North Polar regions. Finally, climatic\r\nconditions in the Antarctic are, latitude for latitude, much more severe\r\nthan in the Arctic.\r\n\r\nWith regard to climate in general, Antarctica has the lowest mean\r\ntemperature and the highest wind-velocity of any land existing. This\r\nnaturally follows from the fact that it is a lofty expanse of ice-clad\r\nland circumscribing the Pole, and that the Antarctic summer occurs when\r\nthe earth is farther from the sun than is the case during the Arctic\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThere are those who would impatiently ask, \"What is the use of it all?\"\r\nThe answer is brief.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nAntarctic Land discoveries preceding the year 1910\r\n\r\n\r\nThe polar regions, like any other part of the globe, may be said to be\r\npaved with facts, the essence of which it is necessary to acquire before\r\nknowledge of this special zone can be brought to even a provisional\r\nexactitude. On the face of it, polar research may seem to be specific\r\nand discriminating, but it must be remembered that an advance in any one\r\nof the departments into which, for convenience, science is artificially\r\ndivided, conduces to the advantage of all. Science is a homogeneous\r\nwhole. If we ignore the facts contained in one part of the world, surely\r\nwe are hampering scientific advance. It is obvious to every one that,\r\ngiven only a fraction of the pieces, it is a much more difficult task to\r\nput together a jig-saw puzzle and obtain an idea of the finished pattern\r\nthan were all the pieces at hand. The pieces of the jig-saw puzzle are\r\nthe data of science.\r\n\r\nThough it is not sufficiently recognized, the advance of science is\r\nattended by a corresponding increase in the creature comforts of\r\nman. Again, from an economic aspect, the frozen South may not attract\r\nimmediate attention. But who can say what a train of enterprise the\r\nfuture may bring?\r\n\r\nCaptain James Cook, on his return to London after the circumnavigation\r\nof Antarctica, held that the far-southern lands had no future. Yet, a\r\nfew years later, great profits were being returned to Great Britain\r\nand the United States from sealing-stations established as a result of\r\nCook's own observations. At the present day, several whaling companies\r\nhave flourishing industries in the Antarctic waters within the American\r\nQuadrant.\r\n\r\nEven now much can be said in regard to the possibilities offered by\r\nthe Antarctic regions for economic development, but, year by year, the\r\noutlook will widen, since man is constantly resorting to subtler and\r\nmore ingenious artifice in applying Nature's resources. It will be\r\nremembered that Charles Darwin, when in Australia, predicted a very\r\nlimited commercial future for New South Wales. But the mastery of man\r\novercame the difficulties which Darwin's too penetrating mind foresaw.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the role of the South in the progress of civilization and\r\nin the development of the arts and sciences, is not now obvious. As\r\nsure as there is here a vast mass of land with potentialities, strictly\r\nlimited at present, so surely will it be cemented some day within the\r\nuniversal plinth of things.\r\n\r\nAn unknown coast-line lay before the door of Australia. Following on\r\nthe general advance of exploration, and as a sequel to several important\r\ndiscoveries, the time arrived when a complete elucidation of the\r\nAntarctic problem was more than ever desirable. In the Australian\r\nQuadrant, the broad geographical features of the Ross Sea area were well\r\nknown, but of the remainder and greater portion of the tract only vague\r\nand imperfect reports could be supplied.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting our plans in outline, it will be as well to review the\r\nstage at which discovery had arrived when our Expedition came upon the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nThe coast-line of the eastern extremity of the Australian Quadrant,\r\nincluding the outline of the Ross Sea and the coast west-north-west\r\nof Cape Adare as far as Cape North, was charted by Ross and has been\r\namplified by seven later expeditions. In the region west of Cape North,\r\nrecent explorers had done little up till 1911. Scott in the 'Discovery'\r\nhad disproved the existence of some of Wilkes's land; Shackleton in the\r\n'Nimrod' had viewed some forty miles of high land beyond Cape North;\r\nlastly, on the eve of our departure, Scott's 'Terra Nova' had met two\r\npatches of new land--Oates Land--still farther west, making it evident\r\nthat the continent ranged at least two hundred and eighty miles in a\r\nwest-north-west direction from Cape Adare.\r\n\r\nJust outside the western limit of the Australian Quadrant lies\r\nGaussberg, discovered by a German expedition under Drygalski in\r\n1902. Between the most westerly point sighted by the 'Terra Nova' and\r\nGaussberg, there is a circuit of two thousand miles, bordering the\r\nAntarctic Circle, which no vessel had navigated previous to 1840.\r\n\r\nThis was the arena of our activities and, therefore, a synopsis of the\r\nvoyages of early mariners will be enlightening.\r\n\r\nBalleny, a whaling-master, with the schooner 'Eliza Scott' of one\r\nhundred and fifty-four tons, and a cutter, the 'Sabrina' of fifty-four\r\ntons, was the first to meet with success in these waters. Proceeding\r\nsouthward from New Zealand in 1839, he located the Balleny Islands, a\r\ngroup containing active volcanoes, lying about two hundred miles off\r\nthe nearest part of the mainland and to the north-west of Cape Adare.\r\nLeaving these islands, Balleny sailed westward keeping a look-out for\r\nnew land. During a gale the vessels became separated and the 'Sabrina'\r\nwas lost with all hands. Balleny in the 'Eliza Scott' arrived safely\r\nin England and reported doubtful land in 122 degrees E. longitude,\r\napproximately. Dr. H. R. Mill says: \"Although the name of the cutter\r\n'Sabrina' has been given to an appearance of land at this point, we\r\ncannot look upon its discovery as proved by the vague reference made by\r\nthe explorers.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1840, Dumont D'Urville sailed southward from Hobart in\r\ncommand of two corvettes, the 'Astrolabe' and the 'Zelee'. Without much\r\nobstruction from floating ice, he came within sight of the Antarctic\r\ncoast, thenceforth known as Adelie Land. The expedition did not set\r\nfoot on the mainland, but on an adjacent island. They remained in the\r\nvicinity of the coast for a few days, when a gale sprang up which was\r\nhazardously weathered on the windward side of the pack-ice. The ships\r\nthen cruised along the face of flat-topped ice-cliffs, of the type known\r\nas barrier-ice or shelf-ice, which were taken to be connected with\r\nland and named Cote Clarie. As will be seen later, Cote Clarie does not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nDr. H. R. Mill sums up the work done by the French expedition during its\r\neleven days' sojourn in the vicinity of the Antarctic coast:\r\n\r\n\"D'Urville's discoveries of land were of but little account. He twice\r\ntraced out considerable stretches of a solid barrier of ice, and at one\r\npoint saw and landed upon rocks in front of it; but he could only give\r\nthe vaguest account of what lay behind the barrier.\"\r\n\r\nWilkes of the American expedition proceeded south from Sydney at the\r\nclose of 1839. His vessels were the 'Vincennes', a sloop of war of seven\r\nhundred and eighty tons, the 'Peacock', another sloop of six hundred and\r\nfifty tons, the 'Porpoise', a gun-brig of two hundred and thirty tons\r\nand a tender, the 'Flying Fish' of ninety-six tons. The scientists\r\nof the expedition were precluded from joining in this part of the\r\nprogramme, and were left behind in Sydney. Wilkes himself was loud in\r\nhis denunciation both of the ships and of the stores, though they had\r\nbeen specially assembled by the naval department. The ships were in\r\nAntarctic waters for a period of forty-two days, most of the time\r\nseparated by gales, during which the crews showed great skill in\r\nnavigating their ill-fitted crafts and suffered great hardships.\r\n\r\nLand was reported almost daily, but, unfortunately, subsequent\r\nexploration has shown that most of the landfalls do not exist. Several\r\nsoundings made by Wilkes were indicative of the approach to land, but\r\nhe must have frequently mistaken for it distant ice-masses frozen in the\r\npack. Experience has proved what deceptive light-effects may be observed\r\namid the ice and how easily a mirage may simulate reality.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause of Wilkes's errors, the truth remains that Ross\r\nsailed over land indicated in a rough chart which had been forwarded\r\nto him by Wilkes, just before the British expedition set out. More\r\nrecently, Captain Scott in the 'Discovery' erased many of the landfalls\r\nof Wilkes, and now we have still further reduced their number. The\r\n'Challenger' approached within fifteen miles of the western extremity\r\nof Wilkes's Termination Land, but saw no sign of it. The 'Gauss' in\r\nthe same waters charted Kaiser Wilhelm II Land well to the south of\r\nTermination Land, and the eastward continuation of the former could\r\nnot have been visible from Wilkes's ship. After the voyage of the\r\n'Discovery', the landfalls, the existence of which had not been\r\ndisproved, might well have been regarded as requiring confirmation\r\nbefore their validity could be recognised.\r\n\r\nThe only spot where rocks were reported in situ was in Adelie Land,\r\nwhere the French had anticipated the Americans by seven days. Farther\r\nwest, earth and stones had been collected by Wilkes from material\r\nembedded in floating masses of ice off the coast of his Knox Land. These\r\nfacts lend credence to Wilkes's claims of land in that vicinity. His\r\nexpedition did not once set foot on Antarctic shores, and, possibly on\r\naccount of the absence of the scientific staff, his descriptions tend to\r\nbe inexact and obscure. The soundings made by Wilkes were sufficient to\r\nshow that he was probably in some places at no great distance from the\r\ncoast, and, considering that his work was carried out in the days of\r\nsailing-ships, in unsuitable craft, under the most adverse weather\r\nconditions, with crews scurvy-stricken and discontented, it is wonderful\r\nhow much was achieved. We may amply testify that he did more than open\r\nthe field for future expeditions.\r\n\r\nAfter we had taken into account the valuable soundings of the\r\n'Challenger' (1872), the above comprised our knowledge concerning\r\nsome two thousand miles of prospective coast lying to the southward of\r\nAustralia, at a time when the plans of the Australasian expedition were\r\nbeing formulated.\r\n\r\nThe original plans for the expedition were somewhat modified upon my\r\nreturn from Europe. Briefly stated, it was decided that a party of five\r\nmen should be stationed at Macquarie Island, a sub-antarctic possession\r\nof the Commonwealth. They were to be provided with a hut, stores and\r\na complete wireless plant, and were to prosecute general scientific\r\ninvestigations, co-operating with the Antarctic bases in meteorological\r\nand other work. After disembarking the party at Macquarie Island, the\r\n'Aurora' was to proceed south on a meridian of 158 degrees E. longitude,\r\nto the westward of which the Antarctic programme was to be conducted.\r\n\r\nTwelve men, provisioned and equipped for a year's campaign and provided\r\nwith wireless apparatus, were to be landed in Antarctica on the first\r\npossible opportunity at what would constitute a main base. Thereafter,\r\nproceeding westward, it was hoped that a second and a third party,\r\nconsisting of six and eight men respectively, would be successively\r\nestablished on the continent at considerable distances apart. Of course\r\nwe were well aware of the difficulties of landing even one party, but,\r\nas division of our forces would under normal conditions secure\r\nmore scientific data, it was deemed advisable to be prepared for\r\nexceptionally favourable circumstances.\r\n\r\nMacquarie Island, a busy station in the days of the early sealers,\r\nhad become almost neglected. Little accurate information was to be had\r\nregarding it, and no reliable map existed. A few isolated facts had been\r\ngathered of its geology, and the anomalous fauna and flora sui generis\r\nhad been but partially described. Its position, eight hundred and\r\nfifty miles south-south-east of Hobart, gave promise of valuable\r\nmeteorological data relative to the atmospheric circulation of the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere and of vital interest to the shipping of Australia\r\nand New Zealand.\r\n\r\nAs to the Antarctic sphere of work, it has been seen that very little\r\nwas known of the vast region which was our goal. It is sufficient to say\r\nthat almost every observation would be fresh material added to the sum\r\nof human knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the work to be conducted from the land bases, it was\r\nintended that oceanographic investigations should be carried on by\r\nthe 'Aurora' as far as funds would allow. With this object in view,\r\nprovision was made for the necessary apparatus which would enable the\r\nship's party to make extensive investigations of the ocean and its floor\r\nover the broad belt between Australia and the Antarctic Continent. This\r\nwas an important branch of study, for science is just as much interested\r\nin the greatest depths of the ocean as with the corresponding elevations\r\nof the land. Indeed, at the present day, the former is perhaps the\r\ngreater field.\r\n\r\nThe scope of our intentions was regarded by some as over-ambitious, but\r\nknowing\r\n\r\n    How far high failure overleaps the bound\r\n    Of low successes,\r\n\r\nand seeing nothing impossible in these arrangements, we continued to\r\nadhere to them as closely as possible, with what fortune remains to be\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nTo secure a suitable vessel was a matter of fundamental importance.\r\nThere was no question of having a ship built to our design, for the\r\nrequisite expenditure might well have exceeded the whole cost of our\r\nExpedition. Accordingly the best obtainable vessel was purchased, and\r\nmodified to fulfil our requirements. Such craft are not to be had in\r\nsouthern waters; they are only to be found engaged in Arctic whaling and\r\nsealing.\r\n\r\nThe primary consideration in the design of a vessel built to navigate\r\namid the ice is that the hull be very staunch, capable of driving into\r\nthe pack and of resisting lateral pressure, if the ice should close in\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nSo a thick-walled timber vessel, with adequate stiffening in the\r\nframework, would meet the case. The construction being of wood imparts\r\na certain elasticity, which is of great advantage in easing the shock\r\nof impacts with floating ice. As has been tragically illustrated in a\r\nrecent disaster, the ordinary steel ship would be ripped on its first\r\ncontact with the ice. Another device, to obviate the shock and to assist\r\nin forging a way through the floe-ice, is to have the bow cut away below\r\nthe water-line. Thus, instead of presenting to the ice a vertical face,\r\nwhich would immediately arrest the ship and possibly cause considerable\r\ndamage on account of the sudden stress of the blow, a sloping,\r\noverhanging bow is adopted. This arrangement enables the bow to rise\r\nover the impediment, with a gradual slackening of speed. The immense\r\nweight put upon the ice crushes it and the ship settles down, moving\r\nahead and gathering speed to meet the next obstacle.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nPlan and Section of S.Y. 'Aurora'\r\n\r\n\r\nOf importance second only to a strong hull is the possession of sails in\r\naddition to engines. The latter are a sine qua non in polar navigation,\r\nwhilst sails allow of economy in the consumption of coal, and always\r\nremain as a last resort should the coal-supply be exhausted or the\r\npropeller damaged.\r\n\r\nThe 'Aurora', of the Newfoundland sealing fleet, was ultimately\r\npurchased and underwent necessary alterations. She was built in Dundee\r\nin 1876, but though by no means young was still in good condition and\r\ncapable of buffeting with the pack for many a year. Also, she was not\r\nwithout a history, for in the earlier days she was amongst those vessels\r\nwhich hurried to the relief of the unfortunate Greely expedition.\r\n\r\nThe hull was made of stout oak planks, sheathed with greenheart and\r\nlined with fir. The bow, fashioned on cutaway lines, was a mass of solid\r\nwood, armoured with steel plates. The heavy side-frames were braced and\r\nstiffened by two tiers of horizontal oak beams, upon which were built\r\nthe 'tween decks and the main deck. Three bulkheads isolated the\r\nfore-peak, the main hold, the engine-room and the after living-quarters\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nA hull of such strength would resist a heavy strain, and, should it\r\nbe subjected to lateral pressure, would in all probability rise out of\r\nharm's way. However, to be quite certain of this and to ensure safety\r\nin the most extreme case it is necessary that the hull be modelled after\r\nthe design adopted by Nansen in the 'Fram'.\r\n\r\nThe principal dimensions were, length one hundred and sixty-five feet,\r\nbreadth thirty feet, and depth eighteen feet.\r\n\r\nThe registered tonnage was three hundred and eighty-six, but the actual\r\ncarrying capacity we found to be about six hundred tons.\r\n\r\nThe engines, situated aft, were compound, supplied with steam from a\r\nsingle boiler. The normal power registered was ninety-eight horse-power,\r\nworking a four-bladed propeller, driving it at the rate of sixty or\r\nseventy revolutions per minute (six to ten knots per hour).\r\n\r\nSteam was also laid on to a winch, aft, for handling cargo in the main\r\nhold, and to a forward steam-windlass. The latter was mainly used for\r\nraising the anchor and manipulating the deep-sea dredging-cable.\r\n\r\nThe ship was square on the foremast and schooner-rigged on the main and\r\nmizen masts.\r\n\r\nBetween the engine-room bulkhead and the chain and sail locker was a\r\nspacious hold. Six large steel tanks built into the bottom of the hold\r\nserved for the storage of fresh water and at any time when empty could\r\nbe filled with seawater, offering a ready means of securing emergency\r\nballast.\r\n\r\nOn the deck, just forward of the main hatch, was a deckhouse, comprising\r\ncook's galley, steward's pantry and two laboratories. Still farther\r\nforward was a small lamp-room for the storage of kerosene, lamps and\r\nother necessaries. A lofty fo'c'sle-head gave much accommodation for\r\ncarpenters', shipwrights' and other stores. Below it, a capacious\r\nfo'c'sle served as quarters for a crew of sixteen men.\r\n\r\nAft, the chart-room, captain's cabin and photographic dark-room formed\r\na block leading up to the bridge, situated immediately in front of the\r\nfunnel. Farther aft, behind the engine-room and below the poop deck, was\r\nthe ward-room(,) a central space sixteen feet by eight feet, filled by\r\nthe dining-table and surrounded by cabins with bunks for twenty persons.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the 'Aurora' arrived in London to her departure from\r\nAustralia, she was a scene of busy activity, as alterations and\r\nreplacements were necessary to fit her for future work.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, stores and gear were being assembled. Purchases were\r\nmade and valuable donations received both in Europe and Australia.\r\nMany and varied were the requirements, and some idea of their great\r\nmultiplicity will be gained by referring to the appendices dealing with\r\nstores, clothing and instruments.\r\n\r\nFinally, reference may be made in this chapter to the staff. In no\r\ndepartment can a leader spend time more profitably than in the selection\r\nof the men who are to accomplish the work. Even when the expedition has\r\na scientific basis, academic distinction becomes secondary in the choice\r\nof men. Fiala, as a result of his Arctic experience, truly says, \"Many\r\na man who is a jolly good fellow in congenial surroundings will become\r\nimpatient, selfish and mean when obliged to sacrifice his comfort,\r\ncurb his desires and work hard in what seems a losing fight. The first\r\nconsideration in the choice of men for a polar campaign should be the\r\nmoral quality. Next should come mental and physical powers.\"\r\n\r\nFor polar work the great desideratum is tempered youth. Although one man\r\nat the age of fifty may be as strong physically as another at the age\r\nof twenty, it is certain that the exceptional man of fifty was also an\r\nexceptional man at twenty. On the average, after about thirty years\r\nof age, the elasticity of the body to rise to the strain of emergency\r\ndiminishes, and, when forty years is reached, a man, medically speaking,\r\nreaches his acme. After that, degeneration of the fabric of the\r\nbody slowly and maybe imperceptibly sets in. As the difficulties of\r\nexploration in cold regions approximate to the limit of human endurance\r\nand often enough exceed it, it is obvious that the above generalizations\r\nmust receive due weight.\r\n\r\nBut though age and with it the whole question of physical fitness must\r\never receive primary regard, yet these alone in no wise fit a man for\r\nsuch an undertaking. The qualifications of mental ability, acquaintance\r\nwith the work and sound moral quality have to be essentially borne in\r\nmind. The man of fifty might then be placed on a higher plane than his\r\nyounger companion.\r\n\r\nWith regard to alcohol and tobacco, it may be maintained on theoretical\r\ngrounds that a man is better without them, but, on the other hand,\r\nhis behaviour in respect to such habits is often an index to his\r\nself-control.\r\n\r\nPerfection is attained when every man individually works with the\r\ndetermination to sacrifice all personal predispositions to the welfare\r\nof the whole.\r\n\r\nOurs proved to be a very happy selection. The majority of the men chosen\r\nas members of the land parties were young graduates of the Commonwealth\r\nand New Zealand Universities, and almost all were representative of\r\nAustralasia. Among the exceptions was Mr. Frank Wild, who was appointed\r\nleader of one of the Antarctic parties. Wild had distinguished himself\r\nin the South on two previous occasions, and now is in the unique\r\nposition of being, as it were, the oldest resident of Antarctica. Our\r\nsojourn together at Cape Royds with Shackleton had acquainted me with\r\nWild's high merits as an explorer and leader.\r\n\r\nLieutenant B. E. S. Ninnis of the Royal Fusiliers, Dr. X. Mertz, an\r\nexpert ski-runner and mountaineer, and Mr. F. H. Bickerton in charge of\r\nthe air-tractor sledge, were appointed in London. Reference has already\r\nbeen made to Captain Davis: to him were left all arrangements regarding\r\nthe ship's complement.\r\n\r\nA \"Who's who\" of the staff appears as an appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II THE LAST DAYS AT HOBART AND THE VOYAGE TO MACQUARIE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;\r\n      Let us journey to a lonely land I know.\r\n      There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to\r\n      guide us.\r\n      And the Wild is calling, calling--Let us go.\"--SERVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to pick up the thread of our story upon the point\r\nof the arrival of the 'Aurora' in Hobart, after her long voyage from\r\nLondon during the latter part of the year 1911.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis had written from Cape Town stating that he expected to\r\nreach Hobart on November 4. In company with Mr. C. C. Eitel, secretary\r\nof the Expedition, I proceeded to Hobart, arriving on November 2.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of November 4 the Harbour Board received news that\r\na wooden vessel, barquentine-rigged, with a crow's-nest on the mainmast,\r\nwas steaming up the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. This left no doubt as\r\nto her identity and so, later in the day, we joined Mr. Martelli, the\r\nassistant harbour-master, and proceeded down the river, meeting the\r\n'Aurora' below the quarantine ground.\r\n\r\nWe heard that they had had a very rough passage after leaving the Cape.\r\nThis was expected, for several liners, travelling by the same route,\r\nand arriving in Australian waters a few days before, had reported\r\nexceptionally heavy weather.\r\n\r\nBefore the ship had reached Queen's Wharf, the berth generously provided\r\nby the Harbour Board, the Greenland dogs were transferred to the\r\nquarantine ground, and with them went Dr. Mertz and Lieutenant Ninnis,\r\nwho gave up all their time during the stay in Hobart to the care of\r\nthose important animals. A feeling of relief spread over the whole\r\nship's company as the last dog passed over the side, for travelling\r\nwith a deck cargo of dogs is not the most enviable thing from a sailor's\r\npoint of view. Especially is this the case in a sailing-vessel\r\nwhere room is limited, and consequently dogs and ropes are mixed\r\nindiscriminately.\r\n\r\nEvening was just coming on when we reached the wharf, and, as we ranged\r\nalongside, the Premier, Sir Elliot Lewis, came on board and bade us\r\nwelcome to Tasmania.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis had much to tell, for more than four months had elapsed\r\nsince my departure from London, when he had been left in charge of the\r\nship and of the final arrangements.\r\n\r\nAt the docks there had been delays and difficulties in the execution of\r\nthe necessary alterations to the ship, in consequence of strikes and the\r\nCoronation festivities. It was so urgent to reach Australia in time for\r\nthe ensuing Antarctic summer, that the recaulking of the decks and\r\nother improvements were postponed, to be executed on the voyage or upon\r\narrival in Australia.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis seized the earliest possible opportunity of departure, and\r\nthe 'Aurora' dropped down the Thames at midnight on July 27, 1911. As\r\nshe threaded her way through the crowded traffic by the dim light of a\r\nthousand flickering flames gleaming through the foggy atmosphere, the\r\ndogs entered a protest peculiar to their \"husky\" kind. After a short\r\npreliminary excursion through a considerable range of the scale, they\r\npicked up a note apparently suitable to all and settled down to many\r\nhours of incessant and monotonous howling, as is the custom of these\r\ndogs when the fit takes them. It was quite evident that they were not\r\nlooking forward to another sea voyage. The pandemonium made it all\r\nbut impossible to hear the orders given for working the ship, and a\r\ncollision was narrowly averted. During those rare lulls, when the dogs'\r\nrepertoire temporarily gave out, innumerable sailors on neighbouring\r\ncraft, wakened from their sleep, made the most of such opportunities to\r\nhurl imprecations in a thoroughly nautical fashion upon the ship, her\r\nofficers, and each and every one of the crew.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Cardiff, where a full supply of coal was to be shipped, a\r\ngale was encountered, and much water came on board, resulting in damage\r\nto the stores. Some water leaked into the living quarters and, on the\r\nwhole, several very uncomfortable days were spent. Such inconvenience\r\nat the outset undoubtedly did good, for many of the crew, evidently not\r\nprepared for emergency conditions, left at Cardiff. The scratch crew\r\nwith which the 'Aurora'journeyed to Hobart composed for the most part of\r\nreplacements made at Cardiff, resulted in some permanent appointments of\r\nunexpected value to the Expedition.\r\n\r\nAt Cardiff the coal strike caused delay, but eventually some five\r\nhundred tons of the Crown Fuel Company's briquettes were got on board,\r\nand a final leave taken of English shores on August 4.\r\n\r\nCape Town, the only intermediate port of call, was reached on September\r\n24, after a comparatively rapid and uneventful voyage. A couple of days\r\nsufficed to load coal, water and fresh provisions, and the course was\r\nthen laid for Hobart.\r\n\r\nRough weather soon intervened, and Lieutenant Ninnis and Dr. Mertz, who\r\ntravelled out by the 'Aurora' in charge of the sledging-dogs, had their\r\ntime fully occupied, for the wet conditions began to tell on their\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nOn leaving London there were forty-nine of these Greenland, Esquimaux\r\nsledging-dogs of which the purchase and selection had been made through\r\nthe offices of the Danish Geographical Society. From Greenland they\r\nwere taken to Copenhagen, and from thence transhipped to London, where\r\nMessrs. Spratt took charge of them at their dog-farm until the date of\r\ndeparture. During the voyage they were fed on the finest dog-cakes, but\r\nthey undoubtedly felt the need of fresh meat and fish to withstand the\r\ncold and wet. In the rough weather of the latter part of the voyage\r\nwater broke continually over the deck, so lowering their vitality that a\r\nnumber died from seizures, not properly understood at the time. In each\r\ncase death was sudden, and preceded by similar symptoms. An apparently\r\nhealthy dog would drop down in a fit, dying in a few minutes, or\r\nduring another fit within a few days. Epidemics, accompanied by similar\r\nsymptoms, are said to be common amongst these dogs in the Arctic\r\nregions, but no explanation is given as to the nature of the disease.\r\nDuring a later stage of the Expedition, when nearing Antarctica, several\r\nmore of the dogs were similarly stricken. These were examined by Drs.\r\nMcLean and Jones, and the results of post-mortems showed that in one\r\ncase death was due to gangrenous appendicitis, in two others to acute\r\ngastritis and colitis.\r\n\r\nThe dog first affected caused some consternation amongst the crew, for,\r\nafter being prostrated on the deck by a fit, it rose and rushed about\r\nsnapping to right and left. The cry of \"mad dog\" was raised. Not\r\nmany seconds had elapsed before all the deck hands were safely in the\r\nrigging, displaying more than ordinary agility in the act. At short\r\nintervals, other men, roused from watch below appeared at the fo'c'sle\r\ncompanion-way. To these the situation at first appeared comic, and\r\ncalled forth jeers upon their faint-hearted shipmates. The next moment,\r\non the dog dashing into view, they found a common cause with their\r\nfellows and sprang aloft. Ere many minutes had elapsed the entire crew\r\nwere in the rigging, much to the amusement of the officers. By this time\r\nthe dog had disappeared beneath the fo'c'sle head, and Mertz and Ninnis\r\nentered, intending to dispatch it. A shot was fired and word passed that\r\nthe deed was done: thereupon the crew descended, pressing forward to\r\nshare in the laurels. Then it was that Ninnis, in the uncertain light,\r\nspying a dog of similar markings wedged in between some barrels, was\r\nfilled with doubt and called out to Mertz that he had shot the wrong\r\ndog. In a flash the crew had once more climbed to safety. It was some\r\ntime after the confirmation of the first execution that they could be\r\nprevailed upon to descend.\r\n\r\nSeveral litters of puppies were born on the voyage, but all except one\r\nsuccumbed to the hardships of the passage.\r\n\r\nThe voyage from Cardiff to Hobart occupied eighty-eight days.\r\n\r\nThe date of departure south was fixed for 4 P.M. of Saturday, December\r\n2, and a truly appalling amount of work had to be done before then.\r\n\r\nMost of the staff had been preparing themselves for special duties; in\r\nthis the Expedition was assisted by many friends.\r\n\r\nA complete, detailed acknowledgment of all the kind help received would\r\noccupy much space. We must needs pass on with the assurance that our\r\nbest thanks are extended to one and all.\r\n\r\nThroughout the month of November, the staff continued to arrive in\r\ncontingents at Hobart, immediately busying themselves in their own\r\ndepartments, and in sorting over the many thousands of packages in the\r\ngreat Queen's Wharf shed. Wild was placed in charge, and all entered\r\nheartily into the work. The exertion of it was just what was wanted to\r\nmake us fit, and prepared for the sudden and arduous work of discharging\r\ncargo at the various bases. It also gave the opportunity of personally\r\ngauging certain qualities of the men, which are not usually evoked by a\r\nuniversity curriculum.\r\n\r\nSome five thousand two hundred packages were in the shed, to be sorted\r\nover and checked. The requirements of three Antarctic bases, and one\r\nat Macquarie Island were being provided for, and consequently the most\r\ncareful supervision was necessary to prevent mistakes, especially as the\r\nomission of a single article might fundamentally affect the work of a\r\nwhole party. To assist in discriminating the impedimenta, coloured bands\r\nwere painted round the packages, distinctive of the various bases.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that, wherever possible, everything should\r\nbe packed in cases of a handy size, to facilitate unloading and\r\ntransportation; each about fifty to seventy pounds in weight.\r\n\r\nIn addition to other distinguishing marks, every package bore a\r\ndifferent number, and the detailed contents were listed in a schedule\r\nfor reference.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the progress of this work, the ship was again\r\noverhauled, repairs effected, and many deficiencies made good. The\r\nlabours of the shipwrights did not interfere with the loading, which\r\nwent ahead steadily during the last fortnight in November.\r\n\r\nThe tanks in the hold not used for our supply of fresh water were packed\r\nwith reserve stores for the ship. The remainder of the lower hold and\r\nthe bunkers were filled with coal. Slowly the contents of the shed\r\ndiminished as they were transfered to the 'tween decks. Then came the\r\noverflow. Eventually, every available space in the ship was flooded\r\nwith a complicated assemblage of gear, ranging from the comparatively\r\nundamageable wireless masts occupying a portion of the deck amidships,\r\nto a selection of prime Australian cheeses which filled one of the\r\ncabins, and pervaded the ward-room with an odour which remained one of\r\nits permanent associations.\r\n\r\nYet, heterogeneous and ill-assorted as our cargo may have appeared to\r\nthe crowds of curious onlookers, Captain Davis had arranged for the\r\nstowage of everything with a nicety which did him credit. The complete\r\neffects of the four bases were thus kept separate, and available in\r\nwhatever order was required. Furthermore, the removal of one unit would\r\nnot break the stowage of the remainder, nor disturb the trim of the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nAt a late date the air-tractor sledge arrived. The body was contained in\r\none huge case which, though awkward, was comparatively light, the case\r\nweighing much more than the contents. This was securely lashed above the\r\nmaindeck, resting on the fo'c'sle and two boat-skids.\r\n\r\nAs erroneous ideas have been circulated regarding the \"aeroplane\r\nsledge,\" or more correctly \"air-tractor sledge,\" a few words in\r\nexplanation will not be out of place.\r\n\r\nThis machine was originally an R.E.P. monoplane, constructed by Messrs.\r\nVickers and Co., but supplied with a special detachable, sledge-runner\r\nundercarriage for use in the Antarctic, converting it into a tractor for\r\nhauling sledges. It was intended that so far as its role as a flier\r\nwas concerned, it would be chiefly exercised for the purpose of drawing\r\npublic attention to the Expedition in Australia, where aviation was then\r\nalmost unknown. With this object in view, it arrived in Adelaide at an\r\nearly date accompanied by the aviator, Lieutenant Watkins, assisted by\r\nBickerton. There it unfortunately came to grief, and Watkins and Wild\r\nnarrowly escaped death in the accident. It was then decided to make no\r\nattempt to fly in the Antarctic; the wings were left in Australia and\r\nLieutenant Watkins returned to England. In the meantime, the machine was\r\nrepaired and forwarded to Hobart.\r\n\r\nAir-tractors are great consumers of petrol of the highest quality. This\r\ndemand, in addition to the requirements of two wireless plants and a\r\nmotor-launch, made it necessary to take larger quantities than we liked\r\nof this dangerous cargo. Four thousand gallons of \"Shell\" benzine and\r\none thousand three hundred gallons of \"Shell\" kerosene, packed in\r\nthe usual four-gallon export tins, were carried as a deck cargo,\r\nmonopolizing the whole of the poop-deck.\r\n\r\nFor the transport of the requirements of the Macquarie Island Base,\r\nthe s.s. 'Toroa', a small steam-packet of one hundred and twenty tons,\r\ntrading between Melbourne and Tasmanian ports, was chartered. It was\r\narranged that this auxiliary should leave Hobart several days after the\r\n'Aurora', so as to allow us time, before her arrival, to inspect the\r\nisland, and to select a suitable spot for the location of the base. As\r\nshe was well provided with passenger accommodation, it was arranged that\r\nthe majority of the land party should journey by her as far as Macquarie\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Tasmania, Sir Harry Barron, the Premier, Sir Elliot\r\nLewis, and the citizens of Hobart extended to us the greatest\r\nhospitality during our stay, and, when the time came, gave us a hearty\r\nsend-off.\r\n\r\nSaturday, December 2 arrived, and final preparations were made. All the\r\nstaff were united for the space of an hour at luncheon. Then began the\r\nfinal leave-taking. \"God speed\" messages were received from far and\r\nwide, and intercessory services were held in the Cathedrals of Sydney\r\nand Hobart.\r\n\r\nWe were greatly honoured at this time by the reception of kind wishes\r\nfrom Queen Alexandra and, at an earlier date, from his Majesty the King.\r\n\r\nProud of such universal sympathy and interest, we felt stimulated to\r\ngreater exertions.\r\n\r\nOn arrival on board, I found Mr. Martelli, who was to pilot us down the\r\nriver, already on the bridge. A vast crowd blockaded the wharf to give\r\nus a parting cheer.\r\n\r\nAt 4 P.M. sharp, the telegraph was rung for the engines, and, with a\r\nfinal expression of good wishes from the Governor and Lady Barron, we\r\nglided out into the channel, where our supply of dynamite and cartridges\r\nwas taken on board. Captain G. S. Nares, whose kindness we had\r\npreviously known, had the H.M.S. 'Fantome' dressed in our honour, and\r\nlusty cheering reached us from across the water.\r\n\r\nAs we proceeded down the river to the Quarantine Station where the dogs\r\nwere to be taken off, Hobart looked its best, with the glancing sails of\r\npleasure craft skimming near the foreshores, and backed by the stately,\r\nsombre mass of Mount Wellington. The \"land of strawberries and cream\",\r\nas the younger members of the Expedition had come to regard it, was for\r\never to live pleasantly in our memories, to be recalled a thousand times\r\nduring the adventurous months which followed. Mr. E. Joyce, whose name\r\nis familiar in connexion with previous Antarctic expeditions, and who\r\nhad travelled out from London on business of the Expedition, was waiting\r\nin mid-stream with thirty-eight dogs, delivering them from a ketch.\r\nThese were passed over the side and secured at intervals on top of the\r\ndeck cargo.\r\n\r\nThe engines again began to throb, not to cease until the arrival at\r\nMacquarie Island. A few miles lower down the channel, the Premier, and\r\na number of other friends and well-wishers who had followed in a small\r\nsteamer, bade us a final adieu.\r\n\r\nBehind lay a sparkling seascape and the Tasmanian littoral; before,\r\nthe blue southern ocean heaving with an ominous swell. A glance at the\r\nbarograph showed a continuous fall, and a telegram from Mr. Hunt, Head\r\nof the Commonwealth Weather Bureau, received a few hours previously,\r\ninformed us of a storm-centre south of New Zealand, and the expectation\r\nof fresh south-westerly winds.\r\n\r\nThe piles of loose gear presented an indescribable scene of chaos, and,\r\neven as we rolled lazily in the increasing swell, the water commenced\r\nto run about the decks. There was no time to be lost in securing movable\r\narticles and preparing the ship for heavy weather. All hands set to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOn the main deck the cargo was brought up flush with the top of the\r\nbulwarks, and consisted of the wireless masts, two huts, a large\r\nmotor-launch, cases of dog biscuits and many other sundries. Butter to\r\nthe extent of a couple of tons was accommodated chiefly on the roof of\r\nthe main deck-house, where it was out of the way of the dogs. The roof\r\nof the chart-house, which formed an extension of the bridge proper,\r\ndid not escape, for the railing offered facilities for lashing sledges;\r\nbesides, there was room for tide-gauges, meteorological screens, and\r\ncases of fresh eggs and apples. Somebody happened to think of space\r\nunoccupied in the meteorological screens, and a few fowls were housed\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nOn the poop-deck there were the benzine, sledges, and the chief magnetic\r\nobservatory. An agglomeration of instruments and private gear rendered\r\nthe ward-room well nigh impossible of access, and it was some days\r\nbefore everything was jammed away into corners. An unoccupied five-berth\r\ncabin was filled with loose instruments, while other packages were\r\nstowed into the occupied cabins, so as to almost defeat the purpose for\r\nwhich they were intended.\r\n\r\nThe deck was so encumbered that only at rare intervals was it visible.\r\nHowever, by our united efforts everything was well secured by 8 P.M.\r\n\r\nIt was dusk, and the distant highlands were limned in silhouette against\r\nthe twilight sky. A tiny, sparkling lamp glimmered from Signal Hill its\r\nwarm farewell. From the swaying poop we flashed back, \"Good-bye, all\r\nsnug on board.\"\r\n\r\nOnward with a dogged plunge our laden ship would press. If 'Fram' were\r\n\"Forward,\" _she_ was to be hereafter our 'Aurora' of \"Hope\"--the Dawn of\r\nundiscovered lands.\r\n\r\nHome and the past were effaced in the shroud of darkness, and thought\r\nleapt to the beckoning South--the \"land of the midnight sun.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the night the wind and sea rose steadily, developing into a full\r\ngale. In order to make Macquarie Island, it was important not to allow\r\nthe ship to drive too far to the east, as at all times the prevailing\r\nwinds in this region are from the west. Partly on this account, and\r\npartly because of the extreme severity of the gale, the ship was hove\r\nto with head to wind, wallowing in mountainous seas. Such a storm,\r\nwitnessed from a large vessel, would be an inspiring sight, but was\r\ndoubly so in a small craft, especially where the natural buoyancy had\r\nbeen largely impaired by overloading. With an unprecedented quantity of\r\ndeck cargo, amongst which were six thousand gallons of benzine, kerosene\r\nand spirit, in tins which were none too strong, we might well have been\r\nexcused a lively anxiety during those days. It seemed as if no power on\r\nearth could save the loss of at least part of the deck cargo. Would it\r\nbe the indispensable huts amidships, or would a sea break on the benzine\r\naft and flood us with inflammable liquid and gas?\r\n\r\nBy dint of strenuous efforts and good seamanship, Captain Davis with\r\nhis officers and crew held their own. The land parties assisted in the\r\ngeneral work, constantly tightening up the lashings and lending \"beef,\"\r\na sailor's term for man-power, wherever required. For this purpose the\r\nmembers of the land parties were divided into watches, so that there\r\nwere always a number patrolling the decks.\r\n\r\nMost of us passed through a stage of sea-sickness, but, except in the\r\ncase of two or three, it soon passed off. Seas deluged all parts of the\r\nship. A quantity of ashes was carried down into the bilge-water pump and\r\nobstructed the steam-pump. Whilst this was being cleared, the emergency\r\ndeck pumps had to be requisitioned. The latter were available for\r\nworking either by hand-power or by chain-gearing from the after-winch.\r\n\r\nThe deck-plug of one of the fresh-water tanks was carried away and,\r\nbefore it was noticed, sea-water had entered to such an extent as to\r\nrender our supply unfit for drinking. Thus we were, henceforth, on a\r\nstrictly limited water ration.\r\n\r\nThe wind increased from bad to worse, and great seas continued to rise\r\nuntil their culmination on the morning of December 5, when one came\r\naboard on the starboard quarter, smashed half the bridge and carried\r\nit away. Toucher was the officer on watch, and no doubt thought himself\r\nlucky in being, at the time, on the other half of the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe deck-rings holding the motor-launch drew, the launch itself was\r\nsprung and its decking stove-in.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 8 we found ourselves in latitude 49 degrees\r\n56 minutes S. and longitude 152 degrees 28' E., with the weather so far\r\nabated that we were able to steer a course for Macquarie Island.\r\n\r\nDuring the heavy weather, food had been prepared only with the greatest\r\ndifficulty. The galley was deluged time and again. It was enough to\r\ndishearten any cook, repeatedly finding himself amongst kitchen debris\r\nof all kinds, including pots and pans full and empty. Nor did the\r\ndifficulties end in the galley, for food which survived until its\r\narrival on the table, though not allowed much time for further mishap,\r\noften ended in a disagreeable mass on the floor or, tossed by a lurch\r\nof more than usual suddenness, entered an adjoining cabin. From such\r\nlocalities the elusive piece de resistance was often rescued.\r\n\r\nAs we approached our rendezvous, whale-birds** appeared. During the\r\nheavy weather, Mother Carey's chickens only were seen, but, as the wind\r\nabated, the majestic wandering albatross, the sooty albatross and the\r\nmollymawk followed in our wake.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** For the specific names refer to Appendix which is a glossary of\r\nspecial and unfamiliar terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhales were observed spouting, but at too great a distance to be\r\ndefinitely recognized.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on December 11 land began to show up, and by 6 A.M. we were\r\nsome sixteen miles off the west coast of Macquarie Island, bearing on\r\nabout the centre of its length.\r\n\r\nIn general shape it is long and narrow, the length over all being\r\ntwenty-one miles. A reef runs out for several miles at both extremities\r\nof the main island, reappearing again some miles beyond in isolated\r\nrocky islets: the Bishop and Clerk nineteen miles to the southward and\r\nthe Judge and Clerk eight miles to the north.\r\n\r\nThe land everywhere rises abruptly from the sea or from an exaggerated\r\nbeach to an undulating plateau-like interior, reaching a maximum\r\nelevation of one thousand four hundred and twenty-five feet. Nowhere\r\nis there a harbour in the proper sense of the word, though six or seven\r\nanchorages are recognized.\r\n\r\nThe island is situated in about 55 degrees S. latitude, and the climate\r\nis comparatively cold, but it is the prevalence of strong winds that is\r\nthe least desirable feature of its weather.\r\n\r\nSealing, so prosperous in the early days, is now carried on in a small\r\nway only, by a New Zealander, who keeps a few men stationed at the\r\nisland during part of the year for the purpose of rendering down sea\r\nelephant and penguin blubber. Their establishment was known to be at the\r\nnorth end of the island near the best of the anchorages.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis had visited the island in the 'Nimrod', and was acquainted\r\nwith the three anchorages, which are all on the east side and sheltered\r\nfrom the prevailing westerlies. One of the old-time sealers had reported\r\na cove suitable for small craft at the south-western corner, but the\r\ninformation was scanty, and recent mariners had avoided that side of\r\nthe island. On the morning of our approach the breeze was from the\r\nsouth-east, and, being favourable, Captain Davis proposed a visit.\r\n\r\nBy noon, Caroline Cove, as it is called, was abreast of us. Its small\r\ndimensions, and the fact that a rocky islet for the most part blocks the\r\nentrance, at first caused some misgivings as to its identity.\r\n\r\nA boat was lowered, and a party of us rowed in towards the entrance,\r\nsounding at intervals to ascertain whether the 'Aurora' could make use\r\nof it, should our inspection prove it a suitable locality for the land\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nWe passed through a channel not more than eighty yards wide, but with\r\ndeep water almost to the rocks on either side. A beautiful inlet now\r\nopened to view. Thick tussock-grass matted the steep hillsides, and the\r\nrocky shores, between the tide-marks as well as in the depths below,\r\nsprouted with a profuse growth of brown kelp. Leaping out of the water\r\nin scores around us were penguins of several varieties, in their actions\r\nreminding us of nothing so much as shoals of fish chased by sharks.\r\nPenguins were in thousands on the uprising cliffs, and from rookeries\r\nnear and far came an incessant din. At intervals along the shore sea\r\nelephants disported their ungainly masses in the sunlight. Circling\r\nabove us in anxious haste, sea-birds of many varieties gave warning\r\nof our near approach to their nests. It was the invasion by man of an\r\nexquisite scene of primitive nature.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nMacquarie Island\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the severe weather experienced, the relaxation made us all feel\r\nlike a band of schoolboys out on a long vacation.\r\n\r\nA small sandy beach barred the inlet, and the whaleboat was directed\r\ntowards it. We were soon grating on the sand amidst an army of Royal\r\npenguins; picturesque little fellows, with a crest and eyebrows of\r\nlong golden-yellow feathers. A few yards from the massed ranks of the\r\npenguins was a mottled sea-leopard, which woke up and slid into the sea\r\nas we approached.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours were spent examining the neighbourhood. Webb and Kennedy\r\ntook a set of magnetic observations, while others hoisted some cases of\r\nstores on to a rocky knob to form a provision depot, as it was quickly\r\ndecided that the northern end of the island was likely to be more\r\nsuitable for a permanent station.\r\n\r\nThe Royal penguins were almost as petulant as the Adelie penguins which\r\nwe were to meet further South. They surrounded us, pecked at our\r\nlegs and chattered with an audacity which defies description. It was\r\ndiscovered that they resented any attempt to drive them into the sea,\r\nand it was only after long persuasion that a bevy took to the water.\r\nThis was a sign of a general capitulation, and some hundreds immediately\r\nfollowed, jostling each other in their haste, squawking, whirring their\r\nflippers, splashing and churning the water, reminding one of a crowd of\r\nminiature surf-bathers. We followed the files of birds marching inland,\r\nalong the course of a tumbling stream, until at an elevation of some\r\nfive hundred feet, on a flattish piece of ground, a huge rookery opened\r\nout--acres and acres of birds and eggs.\r\n\r\nIn one corner of the bay were nests of giant petrels in which sat\r\nhuge downy young, about the size of a barn-door fowl, resembling\r\nthe grotesque, fluffy toys which might be expected to hang on a\r\nChristmas-tree.\r\n\r\nHere and there on the beach and on the grass wandered bright-coloured\r\nMaori hens. On the south side of the bay, in a low, peaty area overgrown\r\nwith tussock-grass, were scores of sea elephants, wallowing in bog-holes\r\nor sleeping at their ease.\r\n\r\nSea elephants, at one time found in immense numbers on all sub-antarctic\r\nislands, are now comparatively rare, even to the degree of extinction,\r\nin many of their old haunts. This is the result of ruthless slaughter\r\nprosecuted especially bY sealers in the early days. At the present time\r\nMacquarie Island is more favoured by them than probably any other known\r\nlocality. The name by which they are popularly known refers to their\r\nelephantine proportions and to the fact that, in the case of the old\r\nmales, the nasal regions are enormously developed, expanding when in\r\na state of excitement to form a short, trunk-like appendage. They have\r\nbeen recorded up to twenty feet in length, and such a specimen would\r\nweigh about four tons.\r\n\r\nArriving on the 'Aurora' in the evening, we learnt that the ship's\r\ncompany had had an adventure which might have been most serious. It\r\nappeared that after dropping us at the entrance to Caroline Cove,\r\nthe ship was allowed to drift out to sea under the influence of the\r\noff-shore wind. When about one-third of a mile north-west of the\r\nentrance, a violent shock was felt, and she slid over a rock which rose\r\nup out of deep water to within about fourteen feet of high-water level;\r\nno sign of it appearing on the surface on account of the tranquil state\r\nof the sea. Much apprehension was felt for the hull, but as no serious\r\nleak started, the escape was considered a fortunate one. A few soundings\r\nhad been made proving a depth of four hundred fathoms within one and a\r\nhalf miles of the land.\r\n\r\nA course was now set for the northern end of the island.\r\nDangerous-looking reefs ran out from many headlands, and cascades of\r\nwater could be seen falling hundreds of feet from the highlands to the\r\nnarrow coastal flats.\r\n\r\nThe anchorage most used is that known as North-East Bay, lying on the\r\neastern side of a low spit joining the main mass of the island, to an\r\nalmost isolated outpost in the form of a flat-topped hill--Wireless\r\nHill--some three-quarters of a mile farther north. It is practically an\r\nopen roadstead, but, as the prevailing winds blow on to the other side\r\nof the island, quiet water can be nearly always expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we arrived at North-East Bay on the morning following our\r\nadventure; a stiff south-east breeze was blowing, and the wash on the\r\nbeach put landing out of the question. Captain Davis ran in as near\r\nthe coast as he could safely venture and dropped anchor, pending the\r\nmoderation of the wind.\r\n\r\nOn the leeward slopes of a low ridge, pushing itself out on to the\r\nsouthern extremity of the spit, could be seen two small huts, but\r\nno sign of human life. This was not surprising as it was only seven\r\no'clock. Below the huts, upon low surf-covered rocks running out from\r\nthe beach, lay a small schooner partly broken up and evidently a recent\r\nvictim. A mile to the southward, fragments of another wreck protruded\r\nfrom the sand.\r\n\r\nWe were discussing wrecks and the grisly toll which is levied by these\r\ndangerous and uncharted shores, when a human figure appeared in front of\r\none of the huts. After surveying us for a moment, he disappeared within\r\nto reappear shortly afterwards, followed by a stream of others rushing\r\nhither and thither; just as if he had disturbed a hornets' nest. After\r\nsuch an exciting demonstration we awaited the next move with some\r\nexpectancy.\r\n\r\nPlanks and barrels were brought on to the beach and a flagstaff was\r\nhoisted. Then one of the party mounted on the barrel, and told us by\r\nflag signals that the ship on the beach was the 'Clyde', which had\r\nrecently been wrecked, and that all hands were safely on shore, but\r\nrequiring assistance. Besides the shipwrecked crew, there were half a\r\ndozen men who resided on the island during the summer months for the\r\npurpose of collecting blubber.\r\n\r\nThe sealers tried repeatedly to come out to us, but as often as it was\r\nlaunched their boat was washed up again on the beach, capsizing them\r\ninto the water. At length they signalled that a landing could be made\r\non the opposite side of the spit, so the anchor was raised and the\r\nship steamed round the north end of the island, to what Captain Davis\r\nproposed should be named Hasselborough Bay, in recognition of the\r\ndiscoverer of the island. This proved an admirable anchorage, for the\r\nwind remained from the east and south-east during the greater part of\r\nour stay.\r\n\r\nThe sealers pushed their boat across the spit, and, launching it in\r\ncalmer water, came out to us, meeting the 'Aurora' some three miles off\r\nthe land. The anchor was let go about one mile and a half from the head\r\nof the bay.\r\n\r\nNews was exchanged with the sealers. It appeared that there had been\r\nmuch speculation as to what sort of a craft we were; visits of ships,\r\nother than those sent down specially to convey their oil to New Zealand,\r\nbeing practically unknown. For a while they suspected the 'Aurora' of\r\nbeing an alien sealer, and had prepared to defend their rights to the\r\nlocal fishery.\r\n\r\nAll was well now, however, and information and assistance were freely\r\nvolunteered. They were greatly relieved to hear that our auxiliary\r\nvessel, the 'Toroa' was expected immediately, and would be available for\r\ntaking the ship-wrecked crew back to civilization.\r\n\r\nOwing to the loss of the 'Clyde', a large shipment of oil in barrels lay\r\npiled upon the beach with every prospect of destruction, just at a time\r\nwhen the realization of its value would be most desirable, to make good\r\nthe loss sustained by the wreck. I decided, therefore, in view of their\r\nhospitality, to make arrangements with the captain of the 'Toroa' to\r\ntake back a load of the oil, upon terms only sufficient to recoup us for\r\nthe extension of the charter.\r\n\r\nIn company with Ainsworth, Hannam and others, I went ashore to select\r\na site for the station. As strong westerly winds were to be expected\r\nduring the greater part of the year, it was necessary to erect\r\nbuildings in the lee of substantial break-winds. Several sites for a hut\r\nconvenient to a serviceable landing-place were inspected at the north\r\nend of the beach. The hut was eventually erected in the lee of a large\r\nmass of rock, rising out of the grass-covered sandy flat at the north\r\nend of the spit.\r\n\r\nIt would have been much handier in every way, both in assembling the\r\nengines and masts and subsequently in operating the wireless station,\r\nhad the wireless plant been erected on the beach adjacent to the\r\nliving-hut. On the other hand, a position on top of the hill had the\r\nadvantage of a free outlook and of increased electrical potential,\r\nallowing of a shorter length of mast. In addition the ground in this\r\nsituation proved to be peaty and sodden, and therefore a good conductor,\r\nthus presenting an excellent \"earth\" from the wireless standpoint. In\r\nshort, the advantages of the hill-site outweighed its disadvantages.\r\nOf the latter the most obvious was the difficult transportation of\r\nthe heavy masts, petrol-engine, dynamo, induction-generator and other\r\nmiscellaneous gear, from the beach to the summit--a vertical height of\r\nthree hundred feet.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this latter work the sealers placed at our disposal a\r\n\"flying fox\" which ran from sea-level to the top of Wireless Hill, and\r\nwhich they had erected for the carriage of blubber. On inspecting it,\r\nWild reported that it was serviceable, but would first require to be\r\nstrengthened. He immediately set about effecting this with the help of a\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nHurley now discovered that he had accidentally left one of his\r\ncinematograph lenses on a rock where he had been working in Caroline\r\nCove. As it was indispensable, and there was little prospect of the\r\nweather allowing of another visit by the ship, it was decided that\r\nhe should go on a journey overland to recover it. One of the sealers,\r\nHutchinson by name, who had been to Caroline Cove and knew the best\r\nroute to take, kindly volunteered to accompany Hurley. The party was\r\neventually increased by the addition of Harrisson, who was to keep a\r\nlook-out for matters of biological interest. They started off at noon on\r\nDecember 13.\r\n\r\nAlthough the greater part of the stores for the Macquarie Island party\r\nwere to arrive by the Toroa there were a few tons on board the 'Aurora'.\r\nThese and the dogs were landed as quickly as possible. How glad the poor\r\nanimals were to be once more on solid earth! It was out of the question\r\nto let them loose, so they were tethered at intervals along a heavy\r\ncable, anchored at both ends amongst the tussock-grass. Ninnis took up\r\nhis abode in the sealers' hut so that he might the better look after\r\ntheir wants, which centred chiefly on sea elephant meat, and that in\r\nlarge quantities. Webb joined Ninnis, as he intended to take full sets\r\nof magnetic observations at several stations in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nBickerton and Gillies got the motor-launch into good working order,\r\nand by means of it the rest of us conveyed ashore several tons of coal\r\nbriquettes, the benzine, kerosene, instruments and the wireless masts,\r\nby noon on December 13.\r\n\r\nEverything but the requirements of the wireless station was landed\r\non the spit, as near the north-east corner as the surf would allow.\r\nFortunately, reefs ran out from the shore at intervals, and calmer water\r\ncould be found in their lee. All gear for the wireless station was taken\r\nto a spot about half a mile to the north-west at the foot of Wireless\r\nHill, where the \"flying fox\" was situated. Just at that spot there was\r\na landing-place at the head of a charming little boat harbour, formed by\r\nnumerous kelp-covered rocky reefs rising at intervals above the level of\r\nhigh water. These broke the swell, so that in most weathers calm water\r\nwas assured at the landing-place.\r\n\r\nThis boat harbour was a fascinating spot. The western side was peopled\r\nby a rookery of blue-eyed cormorants; scattered nests of white gulls\r\nrelieved the sombre appearance of the reefs on the opposite side: whilst\r\ngentoo penguins in numbers were busy hatching their eggs on the sloping\r\nground beyond. Skua-gulls and giant petrels were perched here and there\r\namongst the rocks, watching for an opportunity of marauding the nests of\r\nthe non-predacious birds. Sea elephants raised their massive, dripping\r\nheads in shoal and channel. The dark reefs, running out into the\r\npellucid water, supported a vast growth of a snake-like form of kelp,\r\nwhose octopus-like tentacles, many yards in length, writhed yellow\r\nand brown to the swing of the surge, and gave the foreground an\r\nindescribable weirdness. I stood looking out to sea from here one\r\nevening, soon after sunset, the launch lazily rolling in the swell, and\r\nthe 'Aurora' in the offing, while the rich tints of the afterglow paled\r\nin the south-west.\r\n\r\nI envied Wild and his party, whose occupation in connexion with the\r\n\"flying fox\" kept them permanently camped at this spot.\r\n\r\nThe 'Toroa' made her appearance on the afternoon of December 13, and\r\ncame to anchor about half a mile inside the 'Aurora'. Her departure had\r\nbeen delayed by the bad weather. Leaving Hobart late on December 7, she\r\nhad anchored off Bruni Island awaiting the moderation of the sea. The\r\njourney was resumed on the morning of the 9th, and the passage made in\r\nfine weather. She proved a handy craft for work of the kind, and Captain\r\nHolliman, the master, was well used to the dangers of uncharted coastal\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes of her arrival, a five-ton motor-boat of shallow\r\ndraught was launched and unloading commenced.\r\n\r\nThose of the staff arriving by the 'Toroa' were housed ashore with the\r\nsealers, as, when everybody was on board, the 'Aurora' was uncomfortably\r\ncongested. Fifty sheep were taken on shore to feed on the rank grass\r\nuntil our departure. A large part of the cargo consisted of coal for the\r\n'Aurora'. This was already partly bagged, and in that form was loaded\r\ninto the launches and whale-boats; the former towing the latter to their\r\ndestination. Thus a continuous stream of coal and stores was passing\r\nfrom ship to ship, and from the ships to the several landing-places on\r\nshore. As soon as the after-hold on the 'Toroa' was cleared, barrels\r\nof sea elephant oil were brought off in rafts and loaded aft,\r\nsimultaneously with the unloading forward.\r\n\r\nWe kept at the work as long as possible--about sixteen hours a day\r\nincluding a short interval for lunch. There were twenty-five of the\r\nland party available for general work, and with some assistance from the\r\nship's crew the work went forward at a rapid rate.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th, after giving final instructions to Eitel,\r\nwho had come thus far and was returning as arranged, the 'Toroa' weighed\r\nanchor and we parted with a cheer.\r\n\r\nThe transportation of the wireless equipment to the top of the hill\r\nhad been going on simultaneously with the un-loading of the ships. Now,\r\nhowever, all were able to concentrate upon it, and the work went forward\r\nvery rapidly.\r\n\r\nAll the wireless instruments, and much of the other paraphernalia of\r\nthe Macquarie Island party had been packed in the barrels, as it was\r\nexpected that they would have to be rafted ashore through the surf.\r\nFortunately, the weather continued to \"hold\" from an easterly direction,\r\nand everything was able to be landed in the comparatively calm waters\r\nof Hasselborough Bay; a circumstance which the islanders assured us was\r\nquite a rare thing. The wireless masts were rafted ashore. These were of\r\noregon pine, each composed of four sections.\r\n\r\nDigging the pits for bedding the heavy, wooden \"dead men,\" and erecting\r\nthe wireless masts, the engine-hut and the operating-hut provided\r\nplenty of work for all. Here was as busy a scene as one could witness\r\nanywhere--some with the picks and shovels, others with hammers and\r\nnails, sailors splicing ropes and fitting masts, and a stream of men\r\nhauling the loads up from the sea-shore to their destination on the\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\nSome details of the working of the \"flying fox\" will be of interest. The\r\ndistance between the lower and upper terminals was some eight hundred\r\nfeet. This was spanned by two steel-wire carrying cables, secured above\r\nby \"dead men\" sunk in the soil, and below by a turn around a huge rock\r\nwhich outcropped amongst the tussock-grass on the flat, some fifty yards\r\nfrom the head of the boat harbour. For hauling up the loads, a thin wire\r\nline, with a pulley-block at either extremity, rolling one on each of\r\nthe carrying wires, passed round a snatch-block at the upper station. It\r\nwas of such a length that when the loading end was at the lower station,\r\nthe counterpoise end was in position to descend at the other. Thus a\r\nfreight was dispatched to the top of the hill by filling a bag, acting\r\nas counterpoise, with earth, until slightly in excess of the weight of\r\nthe top load; then off it would start gathering speed as it went.\r\n\r\nSeveral devices were developed for arresting the pace as the freight\r\nneared the end of its journey, but accidents were always liable to occur\r\nif the counterpoise were unduly loaded. Wild was injured by one of these\r\nbrake-devices, which consisted of a bar of iron lying on the ground\r\nabout thirty yards in front of the terminus, and attached by a rope with\r\na loose-running noose to the down-carrying wire. On the arrival of the\r\ncounterpoise at that point on the wire, its speed would be checked owing\r\nto the drag exerted. On the occasion referred to, the rope was struck\r\nwith such velocity that the iron bar was jerked into the air and struck\r\nWild a solid blow on the thigh. Though incapacitated for a few days, he\r\ncontinued to supervise at the lower terminal.\r\n\r\nThe larger sections of the wireless masts gave the greatest trouble,\r\nas they were not only heavy but awkward. A special arrangement was\r\nnecessary for all loads exceeding one hundredweight, as the single\r\nwire carrier-cables were not sufficiently strong. In such cases both\r\ncarrier-cables were lashed together making a single support, the hauling\r\nbeing done by a straight pull on the top of the hill. The hauling was\r\ncarried out to the accompaniment of chanties, and these helped to\r\nrelieve the strain of the Work. It was a familiar sight to see a string\r\nof twenty men on the hauling-line scaring the skua-gulls with popular\r\nchoruses like \"A' roving\" and \"Ho, boys, pull her along.\" In calm\r\nweather the parties at either terminal could communicate by shouting but\r\nwere much assisted by megaphones improvised from a pair of leggings.\r\n\r\nConsidering the heavy weights handled and the speed at which the work\r\nwas done, we were fortunate in suffering only one breakage, and that\r\nmight have been more serious than it proved. The mishap in question\r\noccurred to the generator. In order to lighten the load, the rotor had\r\nbeen taken out. When almost at the summit of the hill, the ascending\r\nweight, causing the carrying-wires to sag unusually low, struck a rock,\r\nunhitched the lashing and fell, striking the steep rubble slope, to\r\ngo bounding in great leaps out amongst the grass to the flat below.\r\nMarvellous to relate, it was found to have suffered no damage other than\r\na double fracture of the end-plate casting, which could be repaired. And\r\nso it was decided to exchange the generators in the two equipments, as\r\nthere would be greater facilities for engineering work at the Main Base,\r\nAdelie Land. Fortunately, the other generator was almost at the top of\r\nthe ship's hold, and therefore accessible. The three pieces into which\r\nthe casting had been broken were found to be sprung, and would not\r\nfit together. However, after our arrival at Adelie Land, Hannam\r\nfound, curiously enough, that the pieces fitted into place\r\nperfectly--apparently an effect of contraction due to the cold--and with\r\nthe aid of a few plates and belts the generator was made as serviceable\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Hurley, Harrisson, and the sealer, Hutchinson, had\r\nreturned from their trip to Caroline Cove, after a most interesting\r\nthough arduous journey. They had camped the first evening at The\r\nNuggets, a rocky point on the east coast some four miles to the south of\r\nNorth-East Bay. From The Nuggets, the trail struck inland up the\r\nsteep hillsides until the summit of the island was reached; then over\r\npebble-strewn, undulating ground with occasional small lakes, arriving\r\nat the west coast near its southern extremity. Owing to rain and fog\r\nthey overshot the mark and had to spend the night close to a bay at the\r\nsouth-end. There Hurley obtained some good photographs of sea elephants\r\nand of the penguin rookeries.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, December 15, they set off again, this time finding\r\nCaroline Cove without further difficulty. Harrisson remained on the brow\r\nof the hill overlooking the cove, and there captured some prions and\r\ntheir eggs. Hurley and his companion found the lost lens and returned to\r\nHarrisson securing a fine albatross on the way. This solitary bird\r\nwas descried sitting on the hill side, several hundreds of feet above\r\nsea-level. Its plumage was in such good condition that they could not\r\nresist the impulse to secure it for our collection, for the moment not\r\nconsidering the enormous weight to be carried. They had neither firearms\r\nnor an Ancient Mariner's cross-bow, and no stones were to be had in the\r\nvicinity--when the resourceful Hurley suddenly bethought himself of a\r\nsmall tin of meat in his haversack, and, with a fortunate throw, hit the\r\nbird on the head, killing the majestic creature on the spot.\r\n\r\nShouldering their prize, they trudged on to Lusitania Bay, camping there\r\nthat night in an old dilapidated hut; a remnant of the sealing days.\r\nClose by there was known to be a large rookery of King penguins; a\r\nvariety of penguin with richly tinted plumage on the head and shoulders,\r\nand next in size to the Emperor--the sovereign bird of the Antarctic\r\nRegions. The breeding season was at its height, so Harrisson secured and\r\npreserved a great number of their eggs. Hutchinson kindly volunteered\r\nto carry the albatross in addition to his original load. If they had\r\nskinned the bird, the weight would have been materially reduced, but\r\nwith the meagre appliances at hand, it would undoubtedly have been\r\nspoiled as a specimen. Hurley, very ambitiously, had taken a heavy\r\ncamera, in addition to a blanket and other sundries. During the rough\r\nand wet walking of the previous day, his boots had worn out and caused\r\nhim to twist a tendon in the right foot, so that he was not up to his\r\nusual form, while Harrisson was hampered with a bulky cargo of eggs and\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nSaddled with these heavy burdens, the party found the return journey\r\nvery laborious. Hurley's leg set the pace, and so, later in the day,\r\nHarrisson decided to push on ahead in order to give us news, as they\r\nhad orders to be back as soon as possible and were then overdue. When\r\ndarkness came on, Harrisson was near The Nuggets, where he passed the\r\nnight amongst the tussock-grass. Hurley and Hutchinson, who were five\r\nmiles behind, also slept by the wayside. When dawn appeared, Harrisson\r\nmoved on, reaching the north-end huts at about 9 A.M. Mertz and Whetter\r\nimmediately set out and came to the relief of the other two men a few\r\nhours later.\r\n\r\nFatigue and the lame leg subdued Hurley for the rest of the day, but the\r\nnext morning he was off to get pictures of the \"flying fox\" in action.\r\nIt was practically impossible for him to walk to the top of the hill,\r\nbut not to be baffled, he sent the cinematograph machine up by the\r\n\"flying fox,\" and then followed himself. Long before reaching the top\r\nhe realized how much his integrity depended on the strength of the\r\nhauling-line and the care of those on Wireless Hill.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of our stay at the island, the wind veered to the\r\nnorth and north-north-east. We took advantage of this change to steam\r\nround to the east side, intending to increase our supply of fresh water\r\nat The Nuggets, where a stream comes down the hillside on to the beach.\r\nIn this, however, we were disappointed, for the sea was breaking too\r\nheavily on the beach, and so we steamed back to North-East Bay\r\nand dropped anchor. Wild went off in the launch to search for a\r\nlanding-place but found the sea everywhere too formidable.\r\n\r\nSignals were made to those on shore, instructing them to finish off the\r\nwork on the wireless plant, and to kill a dozen sheep--enough for our\r\nneeds for some days.\r\n\r\nThe ship was now found to be drifting, and, as the wind was blowing\r\ninshore, the anchor was raised, and with the launch in tow we steamed\r\nround to the calmer waters of Hasselborough Bay. At the north end of the\r\nisland, for several miles out to sea along the line of a submerged reef,\r\nthe northerly swell was found to be piling up in an ugly manner, and\r\noccasioned considerable damage to the launch. This happened as the\r\n'Aurora' swung around; a sea catching the launch and rushing it forward\r\nso that it struck the stern of the ship bow-on, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat several of the men exerted themselves to their utmost to prevent\r\na collision. On arrival at the anchorage, the launch was noticeably\r\nsettling down, as water had entered at several seams which had been\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nAfter being partly bailed out, it was left in the water with Hodgeman\r\nand Close aboard, as we wished to run ashore as soon as the weather\r\nimproved. Contrary to expectation the wind increased, and it was\r\ndiscovered that the 'Aurora' was drifting rapidly, although ninety\r\nfathoms of chain had been paid out. Before a steam-winch** was\r\ninstalled, the anchor could be raised only by means of an antiquated\r\nman-power lever-windlass. In this type, a see-saw-like lever is worked\r\nby a gang of men at each extremity, and it takes a long time to get in\r\nany considerable length of chain. The chorus and chanty came to our aid\r\nonce more, and the long hours of heaving on the fo'c'sle head were a\r\nbright if strenuous spot in our memories of Macquarie Island. In course\r\nof time, during which the ship steamed slowly ahead, the end came in\r\nsight--'Vast heaving!--but the anchor was missing. This put us in an\r\nawkward situation, for the stock of our other heavy anchor had already\r\nbeen lost. There was no other course but to steam up and down waiting\r\nfor the weather to moderate. In the meantime, we had been too busy\r\nto relieve Close and Hodgeman, who had been doing duty in the launch,\r\nbailing for five hours, and were thoroughly soaked with spray. All hands\r\nnow helped with the tackle, and we soon had the launch on board in its\r\nold position near the main hatch.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** Fitted on return to Sydney after the first Antarctic cruise.\r\n\r\nThese operations were unusually protracted for we were short handed; the\r\nboatswain, some of the sailors and most of the land party being marooned\r\non shore. We were now anxious to get everybody on board and to be off.\r\nThe completion of their quarters was to be left to the Macquarie Island\r\nparty, and it was important that we should make the most of the southern\r\nseason. The wind blew so strongly, however, that there was no immediate\r\nprospect of departure.\r\n\r\nThe ship continued to steam up and down. On the morning of December 23\r\nit was found possible to lower the whale-boat, and Wild went off with\r\na complement of sturdy oarsmen, including Madigan, Moyes, Watson and\r\nKennedy, and succeeded in bringing off the dogs. Several trips were made\r\nwith difficulty during the day, but at last all the men, dogs and sheep\r\nwere brought off.\r\n\r\nBoth Wild and I went with the whale-boat on its last trip at dusk on the\r\nevening of December 23. The only possible landing-place, with the sea\r\nthen running, was at the extreme north-eastern corner of the beach. No\r\ntime was lost in getting the men and the remainder of the cargo into\r\nthe boat, though in the darkness this was not easily managed. The final\r\nparting with our Macquarie Island party took place on the beach, their\r\ncheers echoing to ours as we breasted the surf and \"gave way\" for the\r\nship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III FROM MACQUARIE ISLAND TO ADELIE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning following our farewell to Ainsworth and party at the north\r\nend of the island found us steaming down the west coast, southward\r\nbound.\r\n\r\nOur supply of fresh water was scanty, and the only resource was to\r\ntouch at Caroline Cove. As a matter of fact, there were several suitable\r\nlocalities on the east coast, but the strong easterly weather then\r\nprevailing made a landing impossible.\r\n\r\nOn the ship nearing the south end, the wind subsided. She then crept\r\ninto the lee of the cliffs, a boat was dropped and soundings disclosed a\r\ndeep passage at the mouth of Caroline Cove and ample water within.\r\nThere was, however, limited space for manoeuvring the vessel if a change\r\nshould occur in the direction of the wind. The risk was taken; the\r\n'Aurora' felt her way in, and, to provide against accident, was anchored\r\nby Captain Davis with her bow toward the entrance. Wild then ran out a\r\nkedge anchor to secure the stern.\r\n\r\nDuring the cruise down the coast the missing stock of our only anchor\r\nhad been replaced by Gillies and Hannam. Two oregon \"dead men\", bolted\r\ntogether on the shank, made a clumsy but efficient makeshift.\r\n\r\nTwo large barrels were taken ashore, repeatedly filled and towed off\r\nto the ship. It was difficult at first to find good water, for the main\r\nstream flowing down from the head of the bay was contaminated by the\r\npenguins which made it their highway to a rookery. After a search, an\r\nalmost dry gulley bed was found to yield water when a pit was dug in its\r\nbed. This spot was some eighty yards from the beach and to reach it one\r\ntraversed an area of tussocks between which sea elephants wallowed in\r\nsoft mire.\r\n\r\nA cordon of men was made and buckets were interchanged, the full ones\r\ndescending and the empty ones ascending. The barrels on the beach were\r\nthus speedily filled and taken off by a boat's crew. At 11 P.M. darkness\r\ncame, and it was decided to complete the work on the following day.\r\n\r\nAs we rowed to the ship, the water was serenely placid. From the dark\r\nenvironing hills came the weird cries of strange birds. There was a hint\r\nof wildness, soon to be forgotten in the chorus of a 'Varsity song and\r\nthe hearty shouts of the rowers.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 A.M. the officer on watch came down to report to Captain Davis\r\na slight change in the direction of the breeze. At 3 A.M. I was again\r\nawakened by hearing Captain Davis hasten on deck, and by a gentle\r\nbumping of the ship, undoubtedly against rock. It appeared that the\r\nofficer on watch had left the bridge for a few minutes, while the wind\r\nfreshened and was blowing at the time nearly broadside-on from the\r\nnorth. This caused the ship to sag to leeward, stretching the bow and\r\nstern cables, until she came in contact with the kelp-covered, steep,\r\nrocky bank on the south side. The narrow limits of the anchorage were\r\nresponsible for this dangerous situation.\r\n\r\nAll hands were immediately called on deck and set to work hauling on\r\nthe stern cable. In a few minutes the propeller and rudder were out of\r\ndanger. The engines were then started slowly ahead, and, as we came up\r\nto the bower anchor, the cable was taken in. The wind was blowing across\r\nthe narrow entrance to the Cove, so that it was advisable to get quickly\r\nunder way. The kedge anchor was abandoned, and we steamed straight out\r\nto sea with the bower hanging below the bows. The wind increased, and\r\nthere was no other course open but to continue the southward voyage.\r\n\r\nThe day so inauspiciously begun turned out beautifully sunny. There was\r\nadditional verve in our Christmas celebration, as Macquarie Island and\r\nthe Bishop and Clerk, in turn, sank below the northern horizon.\r\n\r\nDuring the stay at the island little attention had been given to\r\nscientific matters. All our energies had been concentrated on speedily\r\nlanding the party which was to carry out such special work, so as to\r\nallow us to get away south as soon as possible. Enough had been seen to\r\nindicate the wide scientific possibilities of the place.\r\n\r\nFor some days we were favoured by exceptional weather; a moderate\r\nbreeze from the north-east and a long, lazy swell combining to make our\r\nprogress rapid.\r\n\r\nThe sum of the experiences of earlier expeditions had shown that\r\nthe prevailing winds south of 60 degrees S. latitude were mainly\r\nsouth-easterly, causing a continuous streaming of the pack from east to\r\nwest. Our obvious expedient on encountering the ice was to steam in the\r\nsame direction as this drift. It had been decided before setting out\r\nthat we would confine ourselves to the region west of the meridian\r\nof 158 degrees E. longitude. So it was intended to reach the pack,\r\napproximately in that meridian, and, should we be repulsed, to work\r\nsteadily to the west in expectation of breaking through to the land.\r\n\r\nRegarding the ice conditions over the whole segment of the unknown tract\r\nupon which our attack was directed, very little was known. Critically\r\nexamined, the reports of the American squadron under the command of\r\nWilkes were highly discouraging. D'Urville appeared to have reached\r\nhis landfall without much hindrance by ice, but that was a fortunate\r\ncircumstance in view of the difficulties Wilkes had met. At the western\r\nlimit of the area we were to explore, the Germans in the 'Gauss' had\r\nbeen irrevocably trapped in the ice as early as the month of February.\r\nAt the eastern limit, only the year before, the 'Terra Nova' of Scott's\r\nexpedition, making a sally into unexplored waters, had sighted new land\r\nalmost on the 158th meridian, but even though it was then the end of\r\nsummer, and the sea was almost free from the previous season's ice, they\r\nwere not able to reach the land on account of the dense pack.\r\n\r\nIn the early southern summer, at the time of our arrival, the ice\r\nconditions were expected to be at their worst. This followed from the\r\nfact that not only would local floes be encountered, but also a vast\r\nexpanse of pack fed by the disintegrating floes of the Ross Sea, since,\r\nbetween Cape Adare and the Balleny Islands, the ice drifting to the\r\nnorth-west under the influence of the south-east winds is arrested in\r\nan extensive sheet. On the other hand, were we to wait for the later\r\nseason, no time would remain for the accomplishment of the programme\r\nwhich had been arranged. So we were forced to accept things as we found\r\nthem, being also prepared to make the most of any chance opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn planning the Expedition, the probability of meeting unusually heavy\r\npack had been borne in mind, and the three units into which the land\r\nparties and equipment were divided had been disposed so as to facilitate\r\nthe landing of a base with despatch, and, maybe, under difficult\r\ncircumstances. Further, in case the ship were frozen in, \"wireless\"\r\ncould be installed and the news immediately communicated through\r\nMacquarie Island to Australia.\r\n\r\nAt noon on December 27 whales were spouting all round us, and appeared\r\nto be travelling from west to east. Albatrosses of several species\r\nconstantly hovered about, and swallow-like Wilson petrels--those nervous\r\nrangers of the high seas--would sail along the troughs and flit over the\r\ncrests of the waves, to vanish into sombre distance.\r\n\r\nAlready we were steaming through untravelled waters, and new discoveries\r\nmight be expected at any moment. A keen interest spread throughout the\r\nship. On several occasions, fantastic clouds on the horizon gave hope\r\nof land, only to be abandoned on further advance. On December 28 and 29\r\nlarge masses of floating kelp were seen, and, like the flotsam met with\r\nby Columbus, still further raised our hopes.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of undiscovered islands existing in the Southern Ocean,\r\nsouth of Australia and outside the ice-bound region, kept us vigilant.\r\nSo few ships had ever navigated the waters south of latitude 55\r\ndegrees, that some one and a quarter million square miles lay open to\r\nexploration. As an instance of such a discovery in the seas south of New\r\nZealand may be mentioned Scott Island, first observed by the 'Morning',\r\none of the relief ships of the British Expedition of 1902.\r\n\r\nThe weather remained favourable for sounding and other oceanographical\r\nwork, but as it was uncertain how long these conditions would last, and\r\nin view of the anxiety arising from overloaded decks and the probability\r\nof gales which are chronic in these latitudes, it was resolved to\r\nland one of the bases as soon as possible, and thus rid the ship of\r\nsuperfluous cargo. The interesting but time-absorbing study of the\r\nocean-depths was therefore postponed for a while.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Antarctic land to be expected ahead, many of Wilkes's\r\nlandfalls, where they had been investigated by later expeditions, had\r\nbeen disproved. It seemed as if he had regarded the northern margin\r\nof the solid floe and shelf-ice as land; perhaps also mistaking bergs,\r\nfrozen in the floe and distorted by mirage, for ice-covered land.\r\nNevertheless, his soundings, and the light thrown upon the subject by\r\nthe Scott and Shackleton expeditions, left no doubt in my mind that\r\nland would be found within a reasonable distance south of the position\r\nassigned by Wilkes. Some authorities had held that any land existing\r\nin this region would be found to be of the nature of isolated islands.\r\nThose familiar with the adjacent land, however, were all in favour of it\r\nbeing continental--a continuation of the Victoria Land plateau. The land\r\nlay to the south beyond doubt; the problem was to reach it through\r\nthe belt of ice-bound sea. Still, navigable pack-ice might be ahead,\r\nobviating the need of driving too far to the west.\r\n\r\n\"Ice on the starboard bow!\" At 4 P.M. on December 29 the cry was raised,\r\nand shortly after we passed alongside a small caverned berg whose\r\nbluish-green tints called forth general admiration. In the distance\r\nothers could be seen. One larger than the average stood almost in our\r\npath. It was of the flat-topped, sheer-walled type, so characteristic\r\nof the Antarctic regions; three-quarters of a mile long and half a mile\r\nwide, rising eighty feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that tabular bergs are typical of the Antarctic as\r\nopposed to the Arctic. This diversity is explained by a difference in\r\nthe glacial conditions. In the north, glaciation is not so marked and,\r\nas a rule, coastal areas are free from ice, except for valley-glaciers\r\nwhich transport ice from the high interior down to sea-level. There,\r\nthe summer temperature is so warm that the lower parts of the glaciers\r\nbecome much decayed, and, reaching the sea, break up readily into\r\nnumerous irregular, pinnacled bergs of clear ice. In the south, the\r\ntabular forms result from the fact that the average annual temperature\r\nis colder than that prevailing at the northern axis of the earth. They\r\nare so formed because, even at sea-level, no appreciable amount of\r\nthawing takes place in midsummer. The inland ice pushes out to sea in\r\nenormous masses, and remains floating long before it \"calves\" to form\r\nbergs. Even though its surface has been thrown into ridges as it was\r\ncreeping over the uneven land, all are reduced to a dead level or\r\nslightly undulating plain, in the free-floating condition, and are still\r\nfurther effaced by dense drifts and repeated falls of snow descending\r\nupon them. The upper portion of a table-topped berg consists, therefore,\r\nof consolidated snow; neither temperature nor pressure having been\r\nsufficient to metamorphose it into clear ice. Such a berg in old age\r\nbecomes worn into an irregular shape by the action of waves and weather,\r\nand often completely capsizes, exposing its corroded basement.\r\n\r\nA light fog obscured the surrounding sea and distant bergs glided by\r\nlike spectres. A monstrous block on the starboard side had not been long\r\nadrift, for it showed but slight signs of weathering.\r\n\r\nThe fog thickened over a grey swell that shimmered with an oily lustre.\r\nAt 7 P.M. pack-ice came suddenly to view, and towards it we steered,\r\nvainly peering through the mists ahead in search of a passage. The\r\nice was closely packed, the pieces being small and wellworn. On the\r\noutskirts was a light brash which steadily gave place to a heavier\r\nvariety, composed of larger and more angular fragments. A swishing\r\nmurmur like the wind in the tree-tops came from the great expanse. It\r\nwas alabaster-white and through the small, separate chips was diffused\r\na pale lilac coloration. The larger chunks, by their motion and exposure\r\nto wind and current, had a circle of clear water; the deep sea-blue\r\nhovering round their water-worn niches. Here and there appeared the\r\nochreous-yellow colour of adhering films of diatoms.\r\n\r\nAs we could not see what lay beyond, and the pack was becoming heavier,\r\nthe ship was swung round and headed out.\r\n\r\nSteering to the west through open water and patches of trailing brash,\r\nwe were encouraged to find the pack trending towards the south. By\r\npushing through bars of jammed floes and dodging numerous bergs, twenty\r\nmiles were gained due southwards before the conditions had changed. The\r\nfog cleared, and right ahead massive bergs rose out of an ice-strewn\r\nsea. We neared one which was a mile in length and one hundred feet in\r\nheight. The heaving ocean, dashing against its mighty, glistening walls,\r\nrushed with a hollow boom into caverns of ethereal blue; gothic portals\r\nto a cathedral of resplendent purity.\r\n\r\nThe smaller bergs and fragments of floe crowded closer together, and the\r\ntwo men at the wheel had little time for reverie. Orders came in quick\r\nsuccession--\"Starboard! Steady!\" and in a flash--\"Hard-a-port!\" Then\r\nrepeated all over again, while the rudder-chains scraped and rattled in\r\ntheir channels.\r\n\r\nGradually the swell subsided, smoothed by the weight of ice. The\r\ntranquillity of the water heightened the superb effects of this glacial\r\nworld. Majestic tabular bergs whose crevices exhaled a vaporous azure;\r\nlofty spires, radiant turrets and splendid castles; honeycombed masses\r\nillumined by pale green light within whose fairy labyrinths the water\r\nwashed and gurgled. Seals and penguins on magic gondolas were the silent\r\ndenizens of this dreamy Venice. In the soft glamour of the midsummer\r\nmidnight sun, we were possessed by a rapturous wonder--the rare thrill\r\nof unreality.\r\n\r\nThe ice closed in, and shock after shock made the ship vibrate as she\r\nstruck the smaller pieces full and fair, followed by a crunching and\r\ngrinding as they scraped past the sides. The dense pack had come, and\r\nhardly a square foot of space showed amongst the blocks; smaller\r\nones packing in between the larger, until the sea was covered with a\r\ncontinuous armour of ice. The ominous sound arising from thousands\r\nof faces rubbing together as they gently oscillated in the swell was\r\nimpressive. It spoke of a force all-powerful, in whose grip puny ships\r\nmight be locked for years and the less fortunate receive their last\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\nThe pack grew heavier and the bergs more numerous, embattled in a\r\nformidable array. If an ideal picture, from our point of view it was\r\nimpenetrable. No \"water sky\" showed as a distant beacon; over all was\r\nreflected the pitiless, white glare of the ice. The 'Aurora' retreated\r\nto the open sea, and headed to the west in search of a break in the\r\nice-front. The wind blew from the south-east, and, with sails set to\r\nassist the engines, rapid progress was made.\r\n\r\nThe southern prospect was disappointing, for the heavy pack was ranged\r\nin a continuous bar. The over-arching sky invariably shone with\r\nthat yellowish-white effulgence known as \"ice blink,\" indicative of\r\ncontinuous ice, in contrast with the dark water sky, a sign of open\r\nwater, or a mottled sky proceeding from an ice-strewn but navigable sea.\r\n\r\nThough progress can be made in dense pack, provided it is not too heavy,\r\nadvance is necessarily very slow--a few miles a day, and that at the\r\nexpense of much coal. Without a well-defined \"water sky\" it would have\r\nbeen foolish to have entered. Further, everything pointed to heavier\r\nice-conditions in the south, and, indeed, in several places we\r\nreconnoitred, and such was proved to be the case. Large bergs were\r\nnumerous, which, on account of being almost unaffected by surface\r\ncurrents because of their ponderous bulk and stupendous draught, helped\r\nto compact the shallow surface-ice under the free influence of currents\r\nand winds. In our westerly course we were sometimes able to edge a\r\nlittle to the south, but were always reduced to our old position within\r\na few hours. Long projecting \"tongues\" were met at intervals and, when\r\nnarrow or open, we pushed through them.\r\n\r\nWhales were frequently seen, both rorquals and killers. On the pack,\r\nsea-leopards and crab-eater seals sometimes appeared. At one time as\r\nmany as a hundred would be counted from the bridge and at other moments\r\nnot a single one could be sighted. They were not alarmed, unless the\r\nship happened to bump against ice-masses within a short distance of\r\nthem. A small sea-leopard, shot from the fo'c'sle by a well-directed\r\nbullet from Wild, was taken on board as a specimen; the meat serving as\r\na great treat for the dogs.\r\n\r\nOn January 2, when driving through a tongue of pack, a halt was made to\r\n\"ice ship.\" A number of men scrambled over the side on to a large piece\r\nof floe and handed up the ice. It was soon discovered, however, that the\r\nswell was too great, for masses of ice ten tons or more in weight\r\nswayed about under the stern, endangering the propeller and rudder--the\r\nvulnerable parts of the vessel. So we moved on, having secured enough\r\nfresh-water ice to supply a pleasant change after the somewhat\r\ndiscoloured tank-water then being served out. The ice still remained\r\ncompact and forbidding, but each day we hoped to discover a weak spot\r\nthrough which we might probe to the land itself.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of January 2 we saw a high, pinnacled berg, a few miles\r\nwithin the edge of the pack, closely resembling a rocky peak; the\r\ntransparent ice of which it was composed appeared, in the dull light,\r\nof a much darker hue than the surrounding bergs. Another adjacent block\r\nexhibited a large black patch on its northern face, the exact nature of\r\nwhich could not be ascertained at a distance. Examples of rock debris\r\nembedded in bergs had already been observed, and it was presumed that\r\nthis was a similar case. These were all hopeful signs, for the earthy\r\nmatter must, of course, have been picked up by the ice during its repose\r\nupon some adjacent land.\r\n\r\nAt this same spot, large flocks of silver-grey petrels were seen resting\r\non the ice and skimming the water in search of food. As soon as we had\r\nentered the ice-zone, most of our old companions, such as the albatross,\r\nhad deserted, while a new suite of Antarctic birds had taken their\r\nplace. These included the beautiful snow petrel, the Antarctic petrel,\r\nand the small, lissome Wilson petrel--a link with the bird-life of more\r\ntemperate seas.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of January 3 the wind was blowing fresh from the\r\nsouth-east and falling snow obscured the horizon. The pack took a\r\ndecided turn to the north, which fact was particularly disappointing in\r\nview of the distance we had already traversed to the west. We were now\r\napproaching the longitude of D'Urville's landfall, and still the pack\r\nshowed no signs of slackening. I was beginning to feel very anxious, and\r\nhad decided not to pass that longitude without resorting to desperate\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThe change in our fortunes occurred at five o'clock next morning, when\r\nthe Chief Officer, Toucher, came down from the bridge to report that the\r\natmosphere was clearing and that there appeared to be land-ice near\r\nby. Sure enough, on the port side, within a quarter of a mile, rose a\r\nmassive barrier of ice extending far into the mist and separated from\r\nthe ship by a little loose pack-ice. The problem to be solved was,\r\nwhether it was the seaward face of an ice-covered continent, the\r\nice-capping of a low island or only a flat-topped iceberg of immense\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nBy 7 A.M. a corner was reached where the ice-wall trended southward,\r\nlimned on the horizon in a series of bays and headlands. An El Dorado\r\nhad opened before us, for the winds coming from the east of south had\r\ncleared the pack away from the lee of the ice-wall, so that in the\r\ndistance a comparatively clear sea was visible, closed by a bar of ice,\r\na few miles in extent. Into this we steered, hugging the ice-wall, and\r\nwere soon in the open, speeding along in glorious sunshine, bringing new\r\nsights into view every moment.\r\n\r\nThe wall, along the northern face, was low--from thirty to seventy feet\r\nin height--but the face along which we were now progressing gradually\r\nrose in altitude to the south. It was obviously a shelf-ice formation\r\n(or a glacier-tongue projection of it), exactly similar in build, for\r\ninstance, to the Great Ross Barrier so well described by Ross, Scott,\r\nand others. At the north-west corner, at half a dozen places within\r\na few miles of each other, the wall was puckered up and surmounted by\r\nsemi-conical eminences, half as high as the face itself. These peculiar\r\nelevations were unlike anything previously recorded and remained\r\nunexplained for a while, until closer inspection showed them to be the\r\nresult of impact with other ice-masses--a curious but conceivable cause.\r\n\r\nOn pieces of broken floe Weddell seals were noted. They were the first\r\nseen on the voyage and a sure indication of land, for their habitat\r\nranges over the coastal waters of Antarctic lands.\r\n\r\nA large, low, dome-topped elevation, about one mile in diameter, was\r\npassed on the starboard side, at a distance of two miles from the long\r\nice-cliff. This corresponded in shape with what Ross frequently referred\r\nto as an \"ice island,\" uncertain whether it was a berg or ice-covered\r\nland. A sounding close by gave two hundred and eight fathoms, showing\r\nthat we were on the continental shelf, and increasing the probability\r\nthat the \"ice island\" was aground.\r\n\r\nBirds innumerable appeared on every hand: snow petrels, silver petrels,\r\nCape pigeons and Antarctic petrels. They fluttered in hundreds about\r\nour bows. Cape pigeons are well known in lower latitudes, and it was\r\ninteresting to find them so far south. As they have chessboard-like\r\nmarkings on the back when seen in flight, there is no mistaking them.\r\n\r\nThe ice-wall or glacier-tongue now took a turn to the south-east. At\r\nthis point it had risen to a great height, about two hundred feet sheer.\r\nA fresh wind was blowing in our teeth from the south-south-east, and\r\nbeyond this point would be driving us on to the cliffs. We put the ship\r\nabout, therefore, and made for the lee side of the \"ice island.\"\r\n\r\nIn isolated coveys on the inclined top of the \"island\" were several\r\nflocks, each containing hundreds of Antarctic petrels. At intervals they\r\nwould rise into the air in clouds, shortly afterwards to settle down\r\nagain on the snow.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis moved the ship carefully against the lee wall of the\r\n\"island,\" with a view of replenishing our water supply, but it was\r\nunscalable, and we were forced to withdraw. Crouched on a small\r\nprojection near the water's edge was a seal, trying to evade the eyes of\r\na dozen large grampuses which were playing about near our stern. These\r\nmonsters appeared to be about twenty-five feet in length. They are the\r\nmost formidable predacious mammals of the Antarctic seas, and annually\r\naccount for large numbers of seals, penguins, and other cetaceans. The\r\nsea-leopard is its competitor, though not nearly so ferocious as the\r\ngrampus, of whom it lives in terror.\r\n\r\nThe midnight hours were spent off the \"ice island\" while we wafted for\r\na decrease in the wind. Bars of cirrus clouds covered the whole sky--the\r\npresage of a coming storm. The wind arose, and distant objects were\r\nblotted out by driving snow. An attempt was made to keep the ship\r\nin shelter by steaming into the wind, but as \"ice island\" and\r\nglacier-tongue were lost in clouds of snow, we were fortunate to make\r\nthe lee of the latter, about fourteen miles to the north. There we\r\nsteamed up and down until the afternoon of January 5, when the weather\r\nimproved. A sounding was taken and the course was once more set for the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe sky remained overcast, the atmosphere foggy, and a south-south-east\r\nwind was blowing as we came abreast of the \"ice island,\" which, by the\r\nway, was discovered to have drifted several miles to the north, thus\r\nproving itself to be a free-floating berg. The glacier-tongue on the\r\nport side took a sharp turn to the east-south-east, disappearing on the\r\nhorizon. As there was no pack in sight and the water was merely littered\r\nwith fragments of ice, it appeared most likely that the turn in the\r\nglacier-tongue was part of a great sweeping curve ultimately joining\r\nwith the southward land. On our south-south-east course we soon lost\r\nsight of the ice-cliffs in a gathering fog.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of January 6 the wind abated and the fog began to\r\nclear. At 5 P.M. a line of ice confronted us and, an hour later, the\r\n'Aurora' was in calm water under another mighty ice face trending across\r\nour course. This wall was precisely similar to the one seen on the\r\nprevious evening, and might well have been a continuation of it. It is\r\nscarcely credible that when the 'Aurora' came south the following year,\r\nthe glacier-tongue first discovered had entirely disappeared. It was\r\napparently nothing more than a huge iceberg measuring forty miles in\r\nlength. Specially valuable, as clearing up any doubt that may have\r\nremained, was its re-discovery the following year some fifty miles to\r\nthe north-west. Close to the face of the new ice-wall, which proved to\r\nbe a true glacier-tongue, a mud bottom was found at a depth of three\r\nhundred and ninety-five fathoms.\r\n\r\nWhile we were steaming in calm water to the south-west, the massive\r\nfront, serrated by shallow bays and capes, passed in magnificent review.\r\nIts height attained a maximum of one hundred and fifty feet. In places\r\nthe sea had eaten out enormous blue grottoes. At one spot, several of\r\nthese had broken into each other to form a huge domed cavern, the roof\r\nof which hung one hundred feet above the sea. The noble portico was\r\nflanked by giant pillars.\r\n\r\nThe glacier-tongue bore all the characters of shelf-ice, by which is\r\nmeant a floating extension of the land-ice.** A table-topped berg in the\r\nact of formation was seen, separated from the parent body of shelf-ice\r\nby a deep fissure several yards in width.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** Subsequently this shelf-ice formation was found to be a floating\r\nglacier-tongue sixty miles in length, the seaward extension of a large\r\nglacier which we named the Mertz Glacier.\r\n\r\nAt 11 P.M. the 'Aurora' entered a bay, ten miles wide, bounded on the\r\neast by the shelf-ice wall and on the west by a steep snow-covered\r\npromontory rising approximately two thousand feet in height, as yet seen\r\ndimly in hazy outline through the mist. No rock was visible, but the\r\ncontour of the ridge was clearly that of ice-capped land.\r\n\r\nThere was much jubilation among the watchers on deck at the prospect.\r\nEvery available field-glass and telescope was brought to bear upon it.\r\nIt was almost certainly the Antarctic continent, though, at that time,\r\nits extension to the east, west and south remained to be proved. The\r\nshelf-ice was seen to be securely attached to it and, near its point of\r\njunction with the undulating land-ice, we beheld the mountains of this\r\nmysterious land haloed in ghostly mist.\r\n\r\nWhile passing the extremity of the western promontory, we observed an\r\nexposure of rock, jutting out of the ice near sea-level, in the face of\r\na scar left by an avalanche. Later, when passing within half a cable's\r\nlength of several berg-like masses of ice lying off the coast, rock\r\nwas again visible in black relief against the water's edge, forming a\r\npedestal for the ice. The ship was kept farther offshore, after this\r\nwarning, for though she was designed to buffet with the ice, we had no\r\ndesire to test her resistance to rock.\r\n\r\nThe bottom was very irregular, and as an extra precaution, soundings\r\nwere taken every few minutes. Through a light fog all that could be\r\nseen landwards was a steep, sloping, icy surface descending from the\r\ninterior, and terminating abruptly in a seaward cliff fifty to two\r\nhundred feet in height.\r\n\r\nThe ice-sheet terminating in this wall presented a more broken surface\r\nthan the floating shelf-ice. It was riven and distorted by gaping\r\ncrevasses; an indication of the rough bed over which it had travelled.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight another bay was entered and many rocky islets appeared\r\non its western side. The engines were stopped for a few hours, and the\r\nvoyage was resumed in clearer weather on the following morning.\r\n\r\nAll day we threaded our way between islands and bergs. Seals and\r\npenguins swam around, the latter squawking and diving in a most amusing\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nCautiously we glided by an iceberg, at least one hundred and fifty feet\r\nhigh, rising with a faceted, perpendicular face chased with soft, snowy\r\ntraceries and ornamented with stalactites. Splits and rents broke into\r\nthe margin, and from each streamed the evanescent, azure vapour. Each\r\npuncture and tiny grotto was filled with it, and a sloping cap of\r\nshimmering snow spread over the summit. The profile-view was an exact\r\nreplica of a battleship, grounded astern. The bold contour of the\r\nbow was perfect, and the massive flank had been torn and shattered\r\nby shell-fire in a desperate naval battle. This berg had heeled over\r\nconsiderably, and the original water-line ran as a definite rim, thirty\r\nfeet above the green water. From this rim shelved down a smooth and\r\npolished base, marked with fine vertical striae.\r\n\r\nSoundings varied from twenty to two hundred fathoms, and, accordingly,\r\nthe navigation was particularly anxious work.\r\n\r\nExtending along about fifteen miles of coast, where the inland ice came\r\ndown steeply to the sea, was a marginal belt of sea, about two or three\r\nmiles in width, thickly strewn with rocky islets. Of these some were\r\nflat and others peaked, but all were thickly populated by penguins,\r\npetrels and seals. The rocks appeared all to be gneisses and schists.\r\n\r\nLater that night we lay off a possible landing-place for one of our\r\nbases, but, on more closely inspecting it in the morning, we decided to\r\nproceed farther west into a wide sweeping bay which opened ahead. About\r\nfifty miles ahead, on the far side of Commonwealth Bay, as we named it,\r\nwas a cape which roughly represented in position Cape Decouverte, the\r\nmost easterly extension of Adelie Land seen by D'Urville in 1840.\r\nThough Commonwealth Bay and the land already seen had never before been\r\nsighted, all was placed under the territorial name of Adelie Land.\r\n\r\nThe land was so overwhelmed with ice that, even at sea-level, the rock\r\nwas all but entirely hidden. Here was an ice age in all earnestness; a\r\npicture of Northern Europe during the Great Ice Age some fifty thousand\r\nyears ago. It was evident that the glaciation of Adelie Land was much\r\nmore severe than that in higher Antarctic latitudes, as exampled on the\r\nborders of the Ross Sea; the arena of Scott's, Shackleton's and other\r\nexpeditions. The temperature could not be colder, so we were led to\r\nsurmise that the snowfall must be excessive. The full truth was to be\r\nascertained by bitter experience, after spending a year on the spot.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to find the Antarctic continent in these latitudes bounded\r\nby a rocky and attractive coast like that in the vicinity of Cape Adare;\r\nthe nearest well-explored region. It had proved otherwise, only too well\r\nendorsing the scanty information supplied by D'Urville and Wilkes of\r\nthe coastline seen by them. A glance at the austere plateau and the\r\nice-fettered coast was evidence of a rigid, inhospitable climate. It\r\nwas apparent, too, that only a short summer could be expected in these\r\nlatitudes, thus placing limitations upon our operations.\r\n\r\nIf three bases were to be landed it was important that they should be\r\nspread at sufficiently wide intervals. If one were placed in Adelie\r\nLand, the ship would probably have to break through the pack in\r\nestablishing each of the other two ba ses. Judging by our previous\r\nexperience there was no certain prospect of this being effected. The\r\nsuccessful landing of three bases in suitable positions, sufficiently\r\nfar apart for advantageous co-operation in geographical, meteorological\r\nand other observations, had now become problematical. In addition, one\r\nof the parties was not as strong as I would have liked, considering what\r\nwould be undoubtedly its strenuous future.\r\n\r\nFor some days the various phases of the situation had occupied my mind,\r\nand I now determined to risk two bases, combining the smallest of the\r\nthree parties with the Main Base. Alterations in the personnel of the\r\nthird party were also made, by which the Main Base would be increased in\r\nstrength for scientific work, and the other party under the leadership\r\nof Wild would be composed of men of specially good sledging calibre,\r\nbesides being representative of the leading branches of our scientific\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\nWe had a splendid lot of men, and I had no difficulty in choosing for\r\nWild seven companions who could be relied upon to give a good account of\r\nthemselves. It was only by assuring myself of their high efficiency that\r\nI could expect to rest from undue anxiety throughout the year of our\r\nseparation. The composition of the two parties was as follows:\r\n\r\nMain Base: R. Bage, F. H. Bickerton, J. H. Close, P. E. Correll, W. H.\r\nHannam, A. J. Hodgeman, J. G. Hunter, J. F. Hurley, C. F. Laseron, C.\r\nT. Madigan, A. L. McLean, X. Mertz, H. D. Murphy, B. E. S. Ninnis, F. L.\r\nStillwell, E. N. Webb, L. H. Whetter and myself.\r\n\r\nWestern Party: G. Dovers, C. T. Harrisson, C. A. Hoadley, S. E. Jones,\r\nA. L. Kennedy, M. H. Moyes, A. D. Watson, and F. Wild (leader).\r\n\r\nI was now anxious to find a suitable location for our Main Base; two\r\nreasons making it an urgent matter. The first was, that as we advanced\r\nto the west we were leaving the South Magnetic Pole, and I was anxious\r\nto have our magnetographs running as near the latter as possible.\r\nSecondly, we would be daily increasing our distance from Macquarie\r\nIsland, making wireless communication more uncertain.\r\n\r\nAt noon on January 8, while I was weighing the pros and cons with\r\nCaptain Davis, Wild came in to say that there was a rocky exposure about\r\nfifteen miles off on the port side, and suggested altering our course to\r\nobtain a better view of it.\r\n\r\nJust after 4 P.M., when the ship was about one mile from the nearest\r\nrocks, the whale-boat was lowered and manned. We rowed in with the\r\nobject of making a closer investigation. From the ship's deck, even when\r\nwithin a mile, the outcrop had appeared to project directly from under\r\nthe inland ice-sheet. Now, however, we were surprised to find ourselves\r\namongst an archipelago of islets. These were named the Mackellar Islets,\r\nin remembrance of one who had proved a staunch friend of the Expedition.\r\n\r\nWeddell seals and Adelie penguins in thousands rested upon the rocks;\r\nthe latter chiefly congregated upon a long, low, bare islet situated in\r\nthe centre. This was the largest of the group, measuring about half a\r\nmile in length; others were not above twenty yards in diameter. As we\r\ncame inshore, the main body of the archipelago was found to be separated\r\nby a mile and a half from the mainland. A point which struck us at the\r\ntime was that the islets situated on the southern side of the group were\r\ncapped by unique masses of ice; resembling iced cakes. Later we were\r\nable to see them in process of formation. In the violent southerly\r\nhurricanes prevalent in Adelie Land, the spray breaks right over them.\r\nPart of it is deposited and frozen, and by increments the icing of these\r\nmonstrous \"cakes\" is built up. The amount contributed in winter makes\r\nup for loss by thawing in midsummer. As the islets to windward shelter\r\nthose in their lee, the latter are destitute of these natural canopies.\r\n\r\nSoundings were taken at frequent intervals with a hand lead-line,\r\nmanipulated by Madigan. The water was on the whole shallow, varying\r\nfrom a few to twenty fathoms. The bottom was clothed by dense, luxuriant\r\nseaweed. This rank growth along the littoral was unexpected, for nothing\r\nof the kind exists on the Ross Sea coasts within five or six fathoms of\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nAdvancing towards the mainland, we observed a small islet amongst the\r\nrocks, and towards it the boat was directed. We were soon inside a\r\nbeautiful, miniature harbour completely land-locked. The sun\r\nshone gloriously in a blue sky as we stepped ashore on a charming\r\nice-quay--the first to set foot on the Antarctic continent between Cape\r\nAdare and Gaussberg, a distance of one thousand eight hundred miles.\r\n\r\nWild and I proceeded to make a tour of exploration. The rocky area at\r\nCape Denison, as it was named, was found to be about one mile in\r\nlength and half a mile in extreme width. Behind it rose the inland ice,\r\nascending in a regular slope and apparently free of crevasses--an outlet\r\nfor our sledging parties in the event of the sea not firmly freezing\r\nover. To right and left of this oasis, as the visitor to Adelie Land\r\nmust regard the welcome rock, the ice was heavily crevassed and fell\r\nsheer to the sea in cliffs, sixty to one hundred and fifty feet in\r\nheight. Two small dark patches in the distance were the only evidences\r\nof rock to relieve the white monotony of the coast.\r\n\r\nIn landing cargo on Antarctic shores, advantage is generally taken\r\nof the floe-ice on to which the materials can be unloaded and at once\r\nsledged away to their destination. Here, on the other hand, there was\r\nopen water, too shallow for the 'Aurora' to be moored alongside the\r\nice-foot. The only alternative was to anchor the ship at a distance\r\nand discharge the cargo by boats running to the ideal harbour we had\r\ndiscovered. Close to the boat harbour was suitable ground for the\r\nerection of a hut, so that the various impedimenta would have to be\r\ncarried only a short distance. For supplies of fresh meat, in the\r\nemergency of being marooned for a number of years, there were many\r\nWeddell seals at hand, and on almost all the neighbouring ridges\r\ncolonies of penguins were busy rearing their young.64\r\n\r\nAs a station for scientific investigations, it offered a wider field\r\nthan the casual observer would have imagined. So it came about that the\r\nMain Base was finally settled at Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay.\r\n\r\nWe arrived on board at 8 P.M., taking a seal as food for the dogs.\r\nWithout delay, the motor-launch was dropped into the water, and both it\r\nand the whale-boat loaded with frozen carcasses of mutton, cases of eggs\r\nand other perishable goods.\r\n\r\nWhile some of us went ashore in the motor-launch, with the whale-boat in\r\ntow, the 'Aurora' steamed round the Mackellar Islets seeking for a good\r\nanchorage under the icy barrier, immediately to the west of the boat\r\nharbour. The day had been perfect, vibrant with summer and life, but\r\ntowards evening a chill breeze sprang up, and we in the motor-launch had\r\nto beat against it. By the time we had reached the head of the harbour,\r\nHoadley had several fingers frost-bitten and all were feeling the cold,\r\nfor we were wearing light garments in anticipation of fine weather.\r\nThe wind strengthened every minute, and showers of fine snow were soon\r\nwhistling down the glacier. No time was lost in landing the cargo, and,\r\nwith a rising blizzard at our backs, we drove out to meet the 'Aurora'.\r\nOn reaching the ship a small gale was blowing and our boats were taken\r\nin tow.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be considered was the mooring of the 'Aurora' under\r\nthe lee of the ice-wall, so as to give us an opportunity of getting the\r\nboats aboard. In the meantime they were passed astern, each manned by\r\nseveral hands to keep them bailed out; the rest of us having scrambled\r\nup the side. Bringing the ship to anchor in such a wind in uncharted,\r\nshoal water was difficult to do in a cool and methodical manner. The\r\nsounding machine was kept running with rather dramatic results; depths\r\njumping from five to thirty fathoms in the ship's length, and back again\r\nto the original figure in the same distance. A feeling of relief passed\r\nround when, after much manoeuvring, the anchor was successfully bedded\r\nfive hundred yards from the face of the cliff.\r\n\r\nJust at this time the motor-launch broke adrift. Away it swept before a\r\nwind of forty-five miles per hour. On account of the cold, and because\r\nthe engine was drenched with sea-water, some difficulty was found in\r\nstarting the motor. From the ship's deck we could see Bickerton busily\r\nengaged with it. The rudder had been unshipped, and there was no chance\r\nof replacing it, for the boat was bobbing about on the waves in a most\r\nextraordinary manner. However, Whetter managed to make a jury-rudder\r\nwhich served the purpose, while Hunter, the other occupant, was kept\r\nlaboriously active with the pump.\r\n\r\nThey had drifted half a mile, and were approaching the rocks of an islet\r\non which the sea was breaking heavily. Just as every one was becoming\r\nvery apprehensive, the launch began to forge ahead, and the men had soon\r\nescaped from their dangerous predicament. By the united efforts of all\r\nhands the boats were hoisted on board and everything was made as \"snug\"\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nThe wind steadily increased, and it seemed impossible for the anchor to\r\nhold. The strain on the cable straightened out a steel hook two inches\r\nin diameter. This caused some embarrassment, as the hook was part of\r\nthe cable attachment under the fo'c'sle-head. It is remarkable, however,\r\nthat after this was adjusted the ship did not lose her position up to\r\nthe time of departure from Adelie Land.\r\n\r\nThough we were so close under the shelter of a lofty wall, the waves\r\naround us were at least four feet in height and when the wind increased\r\nto sixty-five and seventy miles per hour, their crests were cut off and\r\nthe surface was hidden by a sheet of racing spindrift.\r\n\r\nEverything was securely lashed in readiness for going to sea, in case\r\nthe cable should part. Final arrangements were then made to discharge\r\nthe cargo quickly as soon as the wind moderated.\r\n\r\nTwo days had elapsed before the wind showed any signs of abatement. It\r\nwas 8 P.M. on January 10 when the first boat ventured off with a small\r\ncargo, but it was not till the following morning that a serious start\r\nwas made. In good weather, every trip between the ship and the boat\r\nharbour, a distance of a mile, meant that five or six tons had been\r\nlanded. It was usual for the loaded launch to tow both whale-boats\r\nheavily laden and, in addition, a raft of hut timbers or wireless masts.\r\nSome of the sailors, while engaged in building rafts alongside the ship,\r\nwere capsized into the water and after that the occupation was not a\r\npopular one.\r\n\r\nAshore, Wild had rigged a derrick, using for its construction two of\r\nthe wireless royal masts. It was thus possible to cope with the heavier\r\npackages at the landing-place. Of the last-named the air-tractor sledge\r\nwas by far the most troublesome. With plenty of manual labour, under\r\nWild's skilful direction, this heavy machine was hoisted from the\r\nmotor-launch, and then carefully swung on to the solid ice-foot.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis superintended the discharging operations on the ship,\r\neffected by the crew and some of the land party under the direction of\r\nthe ship's officers. Wild supervised conveyance ashore, and the landing,\r\nclassification, and safe storage of the various boat-loads. Gillies and\r\nBickerton took alternate shifts in driving the motor-launch. The launch\r\nproved invaluable, and we were very glad that it had been included in\r\nthe equipment, for it did a remarkable amount of work in a minimum of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn view of the difficulty of embarking the boats, if another hurricane\r\nshould arise, tents were erected ashore, so that a party could remain\r\nthere with the boats moored in a sheltered harbour.\r\n\r\nEverything went well until just before midnight on January 12, when the\r\nwind again swept down. Wild, four of the men and I were forced to remain\r\nashore. We spent the time constructing a temporary hut of benzine cases,\r\nroofed with planks; the walls of which were made massive to resist the\r\nwinds. This structure was henceforth known as the \"Benzine Hut\".\r\n\r\nThe barometer dropped to 28.5 inches and the wind remained high. We were\r\nstruck with the singular fact that, even in the height of some of these\r\nhurricanes, the sky remained serene and the sun shone brightly. It had\r\nbeen very different when the ship was amongst the pack a few miles to\r\nthe north, for, there, cloudy and foggy conditions had been the rule.\r\nThe wind coming to us from the south was dry; obviously an argument for\r\nthe continental extension of the land in that direction.\r\n\r\nAt 2 A.M. on January 15 a pre-arranged whistle was sounded from the\r\n'Aurora', advising those of us ashore that the sea had moderated\r\nsufficiently to continue unloading. Wild sped away in the launch, but\r\nbefore he had reached the ship the wind renewed its activity. At last,\r\nafter 2 P.M. on the same day it ceased, and we were able to carry on\r\nwork until midnight, when the wind descended on us once more. This time,\r\neighteen men remained ashore. After twelve hours there was another lull,\r\nand unloading was then continued with only a few intermissions from 1\r\nP.M. on January 16 until the afternoon of January 19.\r\n\r\nNever was landing so hampered by adverse conditions, and yet, thanks to\r\nthe assiduous application of all, a great assortment of materials was\r\nsafely embarked. Comprised among them were the following: twenty-three\r\ntons of coal briquettes, two complete living-huts, a magnetic\r\nobservatory, the whole of the wireless equipment, including masts,\r\nand more than two thousand packages of general supplies containing\r\nsufficient food for two years, utensils, instruments, benzine, kerosene,\r\nlubricating oils an air-tractor and other sledges.\r\n\r\nThen came the time for parting. There was a great field before Wild's\r\nparty to the west, and it was important that they should be able to\r\nmake the most of the remainder of the season. My great regret was that I\r\ncould not be with them. I knew that I had men of experience and ability\r\nin Davis and Wild, and felt that the work entrusted to them was in the\r\nbest of hands. Through the medium of wireless telegraphy I hoped to keep\r\nin touch with the Macquarie Island party, the Western Base,** and the\r\nship itself, when in Australian waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** They were supplied with masts and a receiving set sufficiently\r\nsensitive to pick up messages from a distance of five or six hundred\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIt was my idea that Wild's party should proceed west and attempt to\r\neffect a landing and establish a western wintering station at some\r\nplace not less than four hundred miles west of Adelie Land. On the way,\r\nwhenever opportunity presented itself, they were to cache provisions\r\nat intervals along the coast in places liable to be visited by sledging\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nThe location of such caches and of the Western Base, it was hoped, would\r\nbe communicated to us at the Main Base, through the medium of wireless\r\ntelegraphy from Hobart.\r\n\r\nAll members of the land parties and the ship's officers met in the\r\nward-room. There were mutual good wishes expressed all round, and then\r\nwe celebrated previous Antarctic explorers, more especially D'Urville\r\nand Wilkes. The toast was drunk in excellent Madeira presented to us by\r\nMr. J. T. Buchanan, who had carried this sample round the world with him\r\nwhen a member of the celebrated 'Challenger' expedition.\r\n\r\nThe motor-launch was hoisted and the anchor raised. Then at 8.45 P.M.\r\non January 19 we clambered over the side into one of the whale-boats and\r\npushed off for Cape Denison, shouting farewells back to the 'Aurora'.\r\nSeveral hours later she had disappeared below the north-western horizon,\r\nand we had set to work to carve out a home in Adelie Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV NEW LANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the land party under my charge at Commonwealth Bay on the\r\nevening of January 19, the 'Aurora' set her course to round a headland\r\nvisible on the north-western horizon. At midnight the ship came abreast\r\nof this point and continued steaming west, keeping within a distance of\r\nfive miles of the coast. A break in the icy monotony came with a short\r\ntract of islets fronting a background of dark rocky coastline similar to\r\nthat at Cape Denison but more extensive.\r\n\r\nSome six miles east of D'Urville's Cape Discovery, a dangerous reef was\r\nsighted extending at right angles across the course. The ship steamed\r\nalong it and her soundings demonstrated a submerged ridge continuing\r\nsome twelve miles out to sea. Captain Davis's narrative proceeds:\r\n\r\n\"Having cleared this obstacle we followed the coastline to the west from\r\npoint to point. Twelve miles away we could see the snow-covered slopes\r\nrising from the seaward cliffs to an elevation of one thousand five\r\nhundred feet. Several small islands were visible close to a shore\r\nfringed by numerous large bergs.\r\n\r\n\"At 10 P.M. on January 20, our progress to the west was stopped by a\r\nfleet of bergs off the mainland and an extensive field of berg-laden\r\npack-ice, trending to the north and north-east. Adelie Land could be\r\ntraced continuing to the west. Where it disappeared from view there was\r\nthe appearance of a barrier-formation, suggestive of shelf-ice,\r\nrunning in a northerly direction. Skirting the pack-ice on a north and\r\nnorth-west course, we observed the same appearance from the crow's-nest\r\non January 21 and 22.\"\r\n\r\nThe stretch of open, navigable, coastal water to the north of Adelie\r\nLand, barred by the Mertz Glacier on the east and delimited on the west\r\nby more or less compact ice, has been named the D'Urville Sea. We found\r\nsubsequently that its freedom from obstruction by ice is due to the\r\npersistent gales which set off the land in that locality. To the north,\r\npack-ice in variable amount is encountered before reaching the wide open\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nThe existence of such a \"barrier-formation,\"** as indicated above,\r\nprobably resting on a line of reef similar to the one near Cape\r\nDiscovery, would account for the presence of this ice-field in\r\npractically the same position as it was seen by D'Urville in 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** An analysis of the data derived from the later voyages of the\r\n'Aurora' makes it practically certain that there is a permanent obstacle\r\nto the westerly drift of the pack-ice in longitude 137 degrees E. There\r\nis, however, some uncertainty as to the cause of this blockage. An\r\nalternative explanation is advanced, namely, that within the area\r\nof comparatively shallow water, large bergs are entrapped, and these\r\nentangle the drifting pack-ice.\r\n\r\nAt a distance, large bergs would be undistinguishable from shelf-ice,\r\nappearances of which were reported above.\r\n\r\nQuoting further: \"We were unable to see any trace of the high land\r\nreported by the United States Squadron (1840) as lying to the west and\r\nsouth beyond the compact ice.\r\n\r\n\"At 1.30 A.M. on the 23rd the pack-ice was seen to trend to the\r\nsouth-west. After steaming west for twenty-five miles, we stood south in\r\nlongitude 182 degrees 30' E, shortly afterwards passing over the charted\r\nposition of Cote Clarie. The water here was clear of pack-ice, but\r\nstudded with bergs of immense size. The great barrier which the French\r\nships followed in 1840 had vanished. A collection of huge bergs was the\r\nsole remnant to mark its former position.\r\n\r\n\"At 10 A.M., having passed to the south of the charted position of\r\nD'Urville's Cote Clarie, we altered course to S. 10 degrees E. true.\r\nGood observations placed us at noon in latitude 65 degrees 2' S. and\r\n132 degrees 26' E. A sounding on sand and small stones was taken in one\r\nhundred and sixty fathoms. We sailed over the charted position of land\r\neast of Wilkes's Cape Carr in clear weather.\r\n\r\n\"At 5.30 P.M. land was sighted to the southward--snowy highlands similar\r\nto those of Adelie Land but greater in elevation.\r\n\r\n\"After sounding in one hundred and fifty-six fathoms on mud, the ship\r\nstood directly towards the land until 9 P.M. The distance to the nearest\r\npoint was estimated at twenty miles; heavy floe-ice extending from our\r\nposition, latitude 65 degrees 45' S. and longitude 132 degrees 40' E.,\r\nright up to the shore. Another sounding realized two hundred and thirty\r\nfathoms, on sand and small stones. Some open water was seen to the\r\nsouth-east, but an attempt to force a passage in that direction was\r\nfrustrated.\r\n\r\n\"At 3 A.M. on the 24th we were about twelve miles from the nearest\r\npoint of the coast, and further progress became impossible. The southern\r\nslopes were seamed with numerous crevasses, but at a distance the\r\nprecise nature of the shores could not be accurately determined.\"\r\n\r\nTo this country, which had never before been seen, was given the name of\r\nWilkes's Land; as it is only just to commemorate the American Exploring\r\nExpedition on the Continent which its leader believed he had discovered\r\nin these seas and which he would have found had Fortune favoured him\r\nwith a fair return for his heroic endeavours.\r\n\r\n\"We steered round on a north-westerly course, and at noon on January 24\r\nwere slightly to the north of our position at 5.30 A.M. on the 23rd.\r\nA sounding reached one hundred and seventy fathoms and a muddy bottom.\r\nEnvironing us were enormous bergs of every kind, one hundred and eighty\r\nto two hundred feet in height. During the afternoon a westerly course\r\nwas maintained in clear water until 4 P.M., when the course was altered\r\nto S. 30 degrees W., in the hope of winning through to the land visible\r\non the southern horizon.\"\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nShip's tracks in the vicinity of Totten's Land and North's Land\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 8 P.M. the sky was very clear to the southward, and the land could\r\nbe traced to a great distance until it faded in the south-west. But the\r\nship had come up with the solid floe-ice once more, and had to give\r\nway and steam along its edge. This floating breakwater held us off and\r\nfrustrated all attempts to reach the goal which we sought.\r\n\r\n\"The next four days was a period of violent gales and heavy seas which\r\ndrove the ship some distance to the north. Nothing was visible through\r\nswirling clouds of snow. The 'Aurora' behaved admirably, as she\r\ninvariably does in heavy weather. The main pack was encountered on\r\nJanuary 29, but foggy weather prevailed. It was not until noon on\r\nJanuary 31 that the atmosphere was sufficiently clear to obtain good\r\nobservations. The ship was by this time in the midst of heavy floe in\r\nthe vicinity of longitude 119 degrees E., and again the course had swung\r\nround to south. We had soon passed to the south of Balleny's Sabrina\r\nLand without any indication of its existence. Considering the doubtful\r\ncharacter of the statements justifying its appearance on the chart, it\r\nis not surprising that we did not verify them.\r\n\r\n\"At 11 A.M. the floes were found too heavy for further advance. The\r\nship was made fast to a big one and a large quantity of ice was taken\r\non board to replenish the fresh-water supply. A tank of two hundred\r\ngallons' capacity, heated within by a steam coil from the engineroom,\r\nstood on the poop deck. Into this ice was continuously fed, flowing away\r\nas it melted into the main tanks in the bottom of the ship.\r\n\r\n\"At noon the weather was clear, but nothing could be discerned in the\r\nsouth except a faint blue line on the horizon. It may have been a 'lead'\r\nof water, an effect of mirage, or even land-ice--in any case we could\r\nnot approach it.\"\r\n\r\nThe position as indicated by the noon observations placed the ship\r\nwithin seven miles of a portion of Totten's High Land in Wilkes's\r\ncharts. As high land would have been visible at a great distance, it\r\nis clear that Totten's High Land either does not exist or is situated a\r\nconsiderable distance from its charted location. A sounding was made in\r\nthree hundred and forty fathoms.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nShip's track in the vicinity of Knox Land and Budd Land\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards evening the 'Aurora' turned back to open water and cruised along\r\nthe pack-ice. A sounding next day showed nine hundred and twenty-seven\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that a marked improvement was noted in the\r\ncompass. Ever since the first approach to Adelie Land it had been found\r\nunreliable, for, on account of the proximity to the magnetic pole,\r\nthe directive force of the needle was so slight that very large local\r\nvariations were experienced.\r\n\r\nThe longitude of Wilkes's Knox Land was now approaching. With the\r\nexception of Adelie Land, the account by Wilkes concerning Knox Land\r\nis more convincing than any other of his statements relating to new\r\nAntarctic land. If they had not already disembarked, we had hoped to\r\nland the western party in that neighbourhood. It was, therefore,\r\nmost disappointing when impenetrable ice blocked the way, before\r\nWilkes's \"farthest south\" in that locality had been reached. Three\r\ndetermined efforts were made to find a weak spot, but each time the\r\n'Aurora' was forced to retreat, and the third time was extricated\r\nonly with great difficulty. In latitude 65 degrees 5' S. longitude 107\r\ndegrees 20' E., a sounding of three hundred fathoms was made on a rocky\r\nbottom. This sounding pointed to the probability of land within sixty\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nRepulsed from his attack on the pack, Captain Davis set out westward\r\ntowards the charted position of Termination Land, and in following the\r\ntrend of the ice was forced a long way to the north.\r\n\r\nAt 7.40 A.M., February 8, in foggy weather, the ice-cliff of floating\r\nshelf-ice was met. This was disposed so as to point in a north-westerly\r\ndirection and it was late in the day before the ship doubled its\r\nnorthern end. Here the sounding wire ran out for eight hundred and\r\nfifty fathoms without reaching bottom. Following the wall towards the\r\nsouth-south-east, it was interesting at 5.30 P.M. to find a sounding of\r\none hundred and ten fathoms in latitude 64 degrees 45'. A line of large\r\ngrounded bergs and massive floe-ice was observed ahead trailing away\r\nfrom the ice-wall towards the north-west.\r\n\r\nOn plotting the observations, it became apparent that the shelf-ice was\r\nin the form of a prolonged tongue some seven miles in breadth. As it\r\noccupied the position of the \"Termination Land\" which has appeared on\r\nsome charts, (after Wilkes) it was named Termination Ice-Tongue.\r\n\r\nA blizzard sprang up, and, after it had been safely weathered in the\r\nlee of some grounded bergs, the 'Aurora' moved off on the afternoon of\r\nFebruary 11. The horizon was obscured by mist, as she pursued a tortuous\r\ntrack amongst bergs and scattered lumps of heavy floe. Gradually the sea\r\nbecame more open, and by noon on February 12 the water had deepened\r\nto two hundred and thirty-five fathoms. Good progress was made to the\r\nsouth; the vessel dodging icebergs and detached floes.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a comparatively open sea southward of the main pack was\r\na matter of some moment. As later voyages and the observations of the\r\nWestern Party showed, this tract of sea is a permanent feature of the\r\nneighbourhood. I have called it the Davis Sea, after the captain of the\r\n'Aurora', in appreciation of the fact that he placed it on the chart.\r\n\r\nAt noon, on February 13, in latitude 65 degrees 54 1/2' S. longitude 94\r\ndegrees 25' E., the western face of a long, floating ice-tongue loomed\r\ninto view. There were five hundred fathoms of water off its extremity,\r\nand the cliffs rose vertically to one hundred feet. Soon afterwards land\r\nwas clearly defined low in the south extending to east and west. This\r\nwas thenceforth known as Queen Mary Land.\r\n\r\nThe sphere of operations of the German expedition of 1902 was near at\r\nhand, for its vessel, the 'Gauss', had wintered, frozen in the pack,\r\none hundred and twenty-five miles to the west. It appeared probable that\r\nQueen Mary Land would be found to be continuous** with Kaiser Wilhelm\r\nII Land, which the Germans had reached by a sledging journey from their\r\nship across the intervening sea-ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** Such was eventually proved to be the case.\r\n\r\nThe 'Aurora' followed the western side of the ice-tongue for about\r\ntwenty miles in a southerly direction, at which point there was a\r\nwhite expanse of floe extending right up to the land. Wild and Kennedy,\r\nwalking several miles towards the land, estimated that it was about\r\ntwenty-five miles distant. As the surface over which they travelled was\r\ntraversed by cracks and liable to drift away to sea, all projects of\r\nlanding there had to be abandoned; furthermore, it was discovered that\r\nthe ice-tongue, alongside of which the ship lay, was a huge iceberg. A\r\nlanding on it had been contemplated, but was now out of question.\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty which arose at this juncture was the failing\r\ncoal-supply. It was high time to return to Hobart, and, if a western\r\nbase was to be formed at all, Wild's party would have to be landed\r\nwithout further delay. After a consultation, Davis and Wild decided that\r\nunder the circumstances an attempt should be made to gain a footing on\r\nthe adjacent shelf-ice, if nothing better presented itself.\r\n\r\nThe night was passed anchored to the floe, on the edge of which were\r\nnumerous Emperor penguins and Weddell seals. A fresh south-easterly\r\nwind blew on February 14, and the ship was kept in the shelter of the\r\niceberg. During the day enormous pieces were observed to be continually\r\nbreaking away from the berg and drifting to leeward.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis continues: \"At midnight there was a strong swell from the\r\nnorth-east and the temperature went down to 18 degrees F. At 4 A.M.,\r\nFebruary 15, we reached the northern end of the berg and stood first of\r\nall to the east, and then later to the south-east.\r\n\r\n\"At 8.45 A.M., shelf-ice was observed from aloft, trending approximately\r\nnorth and south in a long wall. At noon we came up with the floe-ice\r\nagain, in about the same latitude as on the western side of the long\r\niceberg. Land could be seen to the southward. At 1 P.M. the ship stopped\r\nat the junction of the floe and the shelf-ice.\"\r\n\r\nWild, Harrison and Hoadley went to examine the shelf-ice with a view\r\nto its suitability for a wintering station. The cliff was eighty to one\r\nhundred feet in height, so that the ice in total thickness must have\r\nattained at least as much as six hundred feet. Assisted by snow-ramps\r\nslanting down on to the floe, the ascent with ice-axes and alpine rope\r\nwas fairly easy.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred yards from the brink, the shelf-ice was thrown into\r\npressure-undulations and fissured by crevasses, but beyond that was\r\napparently sound and unbroken. About seventeen miles to the south the\r\nrising slopes of ice-mantled land were visible, fading away to the far\r\neast and west.\r\n\r\nThe ice-shelf was proved later on to extend for two hundred miles from\r\neast to west, ostensibly fusing with the Termination Ice-Tongue, whose\r\nextremity is one hundred and eighty miles to the north. The whole has\r\nbeen called the Shackleton Ice-Shelf.\r\n\r\nWild and his party unanimously agreed to seize upon this last\r\nopportunity, and to winter on the floating ice.\r\n\r\nThe work of discharging stores was at once commenced. To raise the\r\npackages from the floe to the top of the ice-shelf, a \"flying-fox\" was\r\nrigged.\r\n\r\n\"A kedge-anchor was buried in the sea-ice, and from this a\r\ntwo-and-a-half-inch wire-hawser was led upwards over a pair of\r\nsheer-legs on top of the cliff to another anchor buried some distance\r\nback. The whole was set taut by a tackle. The stores were then slung to\r\na travelling pulley on the wire, and hauled on to the glacier by means\r\nof a rope led through a second pulley on the sheer-legs. The ship's\r\ncompany broke stores out of the hold and sledged them three hundred\r\nyards to the foot of an aerial, where they were hooked on to the\r\ntravelling-block by which the shore party, under Wild, raised them to\r\ntheir destination.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was most important to accelerate the landing as much as possible,\r\nnot only on account of the lateness of the season--the 'Gauss' had been\r\nfrozen in on February 22 at a spot only one hundred and seventy miles\r\naway--but because the floe was gradually breaking up and floating away.\r\nWhen the last load was hoisted, the water was lapping within ten yards\r\nof the 'flying-fox'\".\r\n\r\nA fresh west-north-west wind on February 17 caused some trouble. Captain\r\nDavis writes:\r\n\r\n\"February 19. The floe to which we have been attached is covered by\r\na foot of water. The ship has been bumping a good deal to-day.\r\nNotwithstanding the keen wind and driving snow, every one has worked\r\nwell. Twelve tons of coal were the last item to go up the cliff.\"\r\n\r\nIn all, thirty-six tons of stores were raised on to the shelf-ice, one\r\nhundred feet above sea-level, in four days.\r\n\r\n\"February 20. The weather is very fine and quite a contrast to\r\nyesterday. We did not get the coal ashore a moment too soon, as\r\nthis morning the ice marked by our sledge tracks went to sea in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction, and this afternoon it is drifting back as if\r\nunder the influence of a tide or current. We sail at 7 A.M. to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"I went on to the glacier with Wild during the afternoon. It is somewhat\r\ncrevassed for about two hundred yards inland, and then a flat surface\r\nstretches away as far as the eye can see. I wished the party 'God-speed'\r\nthis evening, as we sail early to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nEarly on February 21, the ship's company gave their hearty farewell\r\ncheers, and the 'Aurora' sailed north, leaving Wild and his seven\r\ncompanions on the floating ice.\r\n\r\nThe bright weather of the immediate coastal region was soon exchanged\r\nfor the foggy gloom of the pack.\r\n\r\n\"February 21, 11 P.M. We are now passing a line of grounded bergs and\r\nsome heavy floe-ice. Fortunately it is calm, but in the darkness it is\r\ndifficult to see an opening. The weather is getting thick, and I expect\r\nwe shall have trouble in working through this line of bergs.\r\n\r\n\"February 22. I cannot explain how we managed to clear some of the bergs\r\nbetween 11 P.M. last night and 3 A.M. this morning. At first stopping\r\nand lying-to was tried, but it was soon evident that the big bergs were\r\nmoving and would soon hem us in: probably in a position from which we\r\nshould be unable to extricate ourselves this season.\r\n\r\n\"So we pushed this way and that, endeavouring to retain freedom at any\r\ncost. For instance, about midnight I was 'starboarding' to clear what\r\nappeared to be the loom of a berg on the starboard bow, when, suddenly,\r\nout of the haze a wall seemed to stretch across our course. There was\r\nno room to turn, so 'full speed astern' was the only alternative. The\r\nengines responded immediately, or we must have crashed right into a huge\r\nberg. Until daylight it was ice ahead, to port and to starboard--ice\r\neverywhere all the time. The absence of wind saved us from disaster.\r\nIt was a great relief when day broke, showing clearer water to the\r\nnorthward.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 23, the 'Aurora' left the shelter of Termination Ice-Tongue,\r\nand a course was set nearly true north. There was a fresh breeze from\r\nthe north-east and a high sea. The ship was desperately short of ballast\r\nand the coal had to be carefully husbanded. All movable gear was placed\r\nin the bottom of the ship, while the ashes were saved, wetted and\r\nput below. The ballast-tanks were found to be leaking and Gillies had\r\nconsiderable trouble in making them watertight.\r\n\r\nThe distance from the Western Base in Queen Mary Land to Hobart was two\r\nthousand three hundred miles, through the turbulent seas of the fifties\r\nand forties. It was the end of a perilous voyage when the 'Aurora'\r\narrived in Hobart with nine tons of coal.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, the captain's log records:\r\n\r\n\"The 'Aurora' has done splendidly, beating all attempts of the weather\r\nto turn her over. We had two heavy gales during the first week of March,\r\nbut reached Hobart safely to-day, passing on our way up the Derwent the\r\nfamous Polar ship, 'Fram', at anchor in Sandy Bay. Flags were dipped and\r\na hearty cheer given for Captain Amundsen and his gallant comrades who\r\nhad raised the siege of the South Pole.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V FIRST DAYS IN ADELIE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overcrowded whale-boat disgorged its cargo at 10 P.M. on the\r\nice-quay at Cape Denison. The only shelter was a cluster of four tents\r\nand the Benzine Hut, so the first consideration was the erection of a\r\ncommodious living-hut.\r\n\r\nWhile the majority retired to rest to be ready for a fresh burst of work\r\non the morrow, a few of us discussed the preliminary details, and struck\r\nthe first blows in the laying of the foundations.\r\n\r\nA site for the living-hut was finally approved. This was a nearly flat\r\npiece of rocky ground of just sufficient size, partially sheltered on\r\nthe southern side by a large upstanding rock. Other points to recommend\r\nit were, proximity to the boat harbour and to a good sledging surface;\r\nthe ice of the glacier extending to the \"front door\" on the western\r\nside. Several large rocks had to be shifted, and difficulty was\r\nanticipated in the firm setting of the stumps. The latter were blocks\r\nof wood, three feet in length, embedded in the ground, forming the\r\nfoundation of the structure. Unfortunately, no such thing as earth or\r\ngravel existed in which to sink these posts, and the rock being of the\r\nvariety known as gneiss, was more than ordinarily tough.\r\n\r\nSince two parties had combined, there were two huts available, and these\r\nwere to be erected so that the smaller adjoined and was in the lee of\r\nthe larger. The latter was to be the living-room; the former serving\r\nas a vestibule, a workshop and an engine-room for the wireless plant.\r\nSlight modifications were made in the construction of both huts,\r\nbut these did not affect the framework. After the completion of the\r\nliving-hut, regular scientific observations were to commence, and the\r\nsmaller hut was then to be built as opportunity offered.\r\n\r\nNothing has so far been said about the type of hut adopted by our\r\nAntarctic stations. As the subject is important, and we had expended\r\nmuch thought thereon before coming to a final decision, a few remarks\r\nwill not be out of place.\r\n\r\nStrength to resist hurricanes, simplicity of construction, portability\r\nand resistance to external cold were fundamental. My first idea was\r\nto have the huts in the form of pyramids on a square base, to ensure\r\nstability in heavy winds and with a large floor-area to reduce the\r\namount of timber used. The final type was designed at the expense of\r\nfloor-space, which would have been of little use because of the low\r\nroof in the parts thus eliminated. In this form, the pyramid extended\r\nto within five feet of the ground on the three windward sides so as to\r\ninclude an outside veranda. That veranda, like the motor-launch, was a\r\nwonderful convenience, and another of the many things of which we made\r\nfull use. It lent stability to the structure, assisted to keep the hut\r\nwarm, served as a store-house, physical laboratory and a dogshelter.\r\n\r\nRound the outside of the three veranda walls boxes of stores were\r\nstacked, so as to continue the roof-slope to the ground. Thus, the wind\r\nstriking the hut met no vertical face, but was partly deflected; the\r\nother force-component tending to pin the building to the ground.\r\n\r\nAll three huts were essentially of the same construction. The\r\nlargest, on account of its breadth, had four special supporting posts,\r\nsymmetrically placed near the centre, stretching from the ground to the\r\nroof framework. The only subdivisions inside were a small vestibule, a\r\nphotographic darkroom and my own room. This rough idea I had handed\r\nover to Hodgeman, leaving him to complete the details and to draw up\r\nthe plans. The frame timbers he employed were stronger than usual in a\r\nbuilding of the size, and were all securely bolted together. The\r\nwalls and roof, both inside and outside, were of tongued and grooved\r\npine-boards, made extra wind-proof by two courses of tarred paper. As\r\nrain was not expected, this roofing was sufficient. There were four\r\nwindows in the roof, one on each side of the pyramid. We should thereby\r\nget light even though almost buried in snow.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nPlan of the hut, Adelie Land\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest hut was presented by the timber merchants of Sydney, and\r\nproved its astonishing strength during the winter hurricanes. The\r\nsmallest was purchased in Adelaide, the third was built and presented by\r\nMessrs. Anthony of Melbourne.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of January 20 all were at work betimes. As we were\r\nsecurely isolated from a trades hall, our hours of labour ranged from 7\r\nA.M. till 11 P.M.\r\n\r\nDynamite was to be used for blasting out the holes for the reception\r\nof the stumps, and so the steel rock-drills were unpacked and boring\r\ncommenced. This was easier than it appeared, because the rock was much\r\ntraversed by cracks. By the end of the day a good deal of damage had\r\nbeen done to the rock, at the expense of a few sore fingers and wrists\r\ncaused by the sledge-hammers missing the drills. The work was tedious,\r\nfor water introduced into the holes had a habit of freezing. The\r\nmetal drills, too, tended to be brittle in the cold and required to be\r\ntempered softer than usual. Hannam operated the forge, and picks and\r\ndrills were sent along for pointing; an outcrop of gneiss serving as an\r\nanvil.\r\n\r\nAmong other things it was found difficult to fire the charges, for, when\r\nfrozen, dynamite is not readily exploded. This was overcome by carrying\r\nthe sticks inside one's pocket until the last moment. In the absence of\r\nearth or clay, we had no tamping material until some one suggested guano\r\nfrom the penguin rookeries, which proved a great success.\r\n\r\nNext day the stumps were in place; most of them being fixed by wedges\r\nand other devices. Cement was tried, but it is doubtful if any good came\r\nof it, for the low temperature did not encourage it to set well. By the\r\nevening, the bottom plates were laid on and bolted to the tops of the\r\nstumps, and everything was ready for the superstructure.\r\n\r\nOn January 22, while some were busy with the floor-joists and\r\nwall-frames, others carried boulders from the neighbouring moraine,\r\nfilling in the whole space between the stumps. These were eventually\r\nembedded in a mass of boulders, as much as three feet deep in places.\r\nBy the time both huts were erected, nearly fifty tons of stones had been\r\nused in the foundations--a circumstance we did not regret at a later\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nHodgeman was appointed clerk of works on the construction, and was\r\nkept unusually busy selecting timber, patrolling among the workmen,\r\nand searching for his foot-rule which had an unaccountable trick of\r\nvanishing in thin air.\r\n\r\nHannam had various occupations, but one was to attend to the needs of\r\nthe inner man, until the completion of the hut. There is no doubt that\r\nhe was regarded at this time as the most important and popular member of\r\nthe party, for our appetites were abnormally good. About an hour before\r\nmeals he was to be seen rummaging amongst the cases of provisions,\r\nselecting tins of various brands and hues from the great confusion.\r\nHowever remote their source or diverse their colour, experience taught\r\nus that only one preparation would emerge from the tent-kitchen. It was\r\na multifarious stew. Its good quality was undoubted, for a few minutes\r\nafter the \"dinner-bell rang\" there was not a particle left. The\r\n\"dinner-bell\" was a lusty shout from the master cook, which was\r\nre-echoed by the brawny mob who rushed madly to the Benzine Hut.\r\nPlates and mugs were seized and portions measured out, while the diners\r\ndistributed themselves on odd boxes lying about on the ice. Many who\r\nwere accustomed to restaurants built tables of kerosene cases and\r\ndined al fresco. After the limited stew, the company fared on cocoa,\r\nbiscuits--\"hard tack\"--and jam, all ad libitum.\r\n\r\nOn those rare summer days, the sun blazed down on the blue ice; skua\r\ngulls nestled in groups on the snow; sly penguins waddled along to\r\ninspect the building operations; seals basked in torpid slumber on\r\nthe shore; out on the sapphire bay the milk-white bergs floated in the\r\nswell. We can all paint our own picture of the good times round the\r\nBenzine Hut. We worked hard, ate heartily and enjoyed life.\r\n\r\nBy the evening of January 24 the floor and outside walls were finished,\r\nand the roof-frame was in position. Work on the roof was the coldest\r\njob of all, for now there was rarely an hour free from a cold breeze, at\r\ntimes reaching the velocity of a gale. This came directly down from the\r\nplateau, and to sit with exposed fingers handling hammer and nails was\r\nnot an enviable job. To add to our troubles, the boards were all badly\r\nwarped from being continually wet with sea-water on the voyage. However,\r\nby judicious \"gadgetting,\" as the phrase went, they were got into place.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nSections across the hut, Adelie Land\r\n\r\n\r\nThe windward roof was up on January 25, and several of us camped in\r\nsleeping-bags under its shelter. Already Hannam had unpacked the large\r\nrange and put the parts together in the kitchen. Henceforth the cooking\r\noperations were simplified, for previously a sledging-cooker had been\r\nused.\r\n\r\nMention of the stove recalls a very cold episode. It happened that while\r\nour goods were being lifted from the boats to the landing-stage, a case\r\nhad fallen into the harbour. When the parts of the stove were being\r\nassembled, several important items were found to be missing, and it was\r\nthought that they might compose the contents of the unknown case lying\r\nin the kelp at the bottom of the bay.\r\n\r\nLaseron and I went on board the whale-boat one day at low water, and\r\nlocated the box with a pole, but though we used several devices with\r\nhooks, we were unable to get hold of it. At last I went in, and,\r\nstanding on tip-toe, could just reach it and keep my head above\r\nwater. It took some time to extricate from the kelp, following which I\r\nestablished a new record for myself in dressing. The case turned out to\r\nbe full of jam, and we had to make a new search for the missing parts.\r\nI do not think I looked very exhilarated after that bath, but strange to\r\nsay, a few days later Correll tried an early morning swim which was the\r\nlast voluntary dip attempted by any one.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of the builders rose to its highest pitch as the roof\r\nneared completion, and we came in sight of a firm and solid habitation,\r\nsecure from the winds which harassed us daily. A dozen hammers worked at\r\nonce, each concentrated upon a specific job. The ardour with which those\r\nengaged upon the ceiling inside the hut plied their nails resulted in\r\nseveral minor casualties to those sitting on the roof, deeply intent\r\non the outer lining. A climax was reached when McLean, working on the\r\nsteeply inclined roof, lost his footing and, in passing, seized hold\r\nof the wire-stay of the chimney as a last hope. Alas, that was the only\r\nstay, and as he proceeded over the end of the roof into a bank of snow,\r\nNinnis, within the hut, convinced that nothing less than a cyclone had\r\nstruck the building, gallantly held on to the lower hot section amidst a\r\nshower of soot.\r\n\r\nEverybody was in the best of spirits, and things went ahead merrily. On\r\nJanuary 30 the main building was almost completed, and all slept under\r\nits roof. Bunks had been constructed, forming a double tier around three\r\nsides of the room. For the first time since coming ashore we retired\r\nto sleep in blankets; fur sleeping-bags had been previously used. That\r\nnight the sky which had been clear for a fortnight banked up with nimbus\r\ncloud, and Murphy, who was sleeping under a gap in the roof, woke up\r\nnext morning to find over him a fine counterpane of snow. He received\r\nhearty congratulations all round.\r\n\r\nRegular meteorological observations began on February 1. The various\r\ninstruments had been unpacked as soon as the outer shell of the Hut was\r\ncompleted. The barometer and barograph were kept running inside. Outside\r\nthere were two large screens for the reception of a number of the\r\ninstruments. It was important to erect these as near the Hut as\r\npossible. The standard thermometer, thermograph and hygrograph were to\r\noccupy one of the screens, a convenient site for which was chosen about\r\ntwenty yards to the east. Close by there was also a nephoscope for\r\ndetermining the motion of clouds. The immediate vicinity of the Hut,\r\nbeing a gully-like depression, was unsuitable for the wind and sunshine\r\nrecorders. A more distant site, on a rocky ridge to the east, was chosen\r\nfor these. There were set up a recording anemometer (wind-velocity\r\nmeter), a sunshine-meter and the second screen containing the anemograph\r\n(wind-direction recorder).\r\n\r\nMadigan was to take charge of the meteorological observations and he,\r\nassisted by Ninnis and Mertz, erected the two screens and mounted\r\nthe instruments. Special care was taken to secure the screens against\r\nviolent winds. Phosphor-bronze wire-stays, with a breaking strength of\r\none ton, were used, attached to billets of wood driven into fissures\r\nin the rock. Strong as these wires were, several breakages had to be\r\nreplaced during the year.\r\n\r\nWebb was busy with the magnetic work. For this two huts were to be\r\nerected; the first for \"absolute\" determinations, the second for housing\r\nthe recording instruments--the magnetographs. Distant sites, away from\r\nthe magnetic disturbances of the Hut, were chosen. Webb and Stillwell\r\nimmediately set to work as soon as they could be spared from the\r\nmain building. For the \"absolute hut\" there were only scrap materials\r\navailable; the \"magnetograph house,\" alone, had been brought complete.\r\nThey had a chilly job, for as the days went by the weather steadily\r\nbecame worse. Yet in a little over a week there were only the finishing\r\ntouches to make, and the first observations were started.\r\n\r\nIt was now necessary to institute a routine of nightwatchmen, cooks and\r\nmessmen. The night-watchman's duties included periodic meteorological\r\nobservations, attention to the fire in the range, and other\r\nmiscellaneous duties arising between the hours of 8 P.M. and 8 A. M.\r\nThe cook prepared the meals, and the messman of the day rendered any\r\nassistance necessary. A rotation was adopted, so arranged that those\r\nmost actively engaged in scientific observations were least saddled with\r\ndomestic duties. Thus each contributed his equivalent share of work.\r\n\r\nWhilst others were occupied finishing off the interior of the\r\nhut, Whetter and Close sledged the cases of stores across from the\r\nlanding-stage, classified them and stacked them against the veranda\r\nwalls. An additional barricade was constructed of flour cases, in the\r\nform of a wall, which increased the breadth of the rocky break-wind on\r\nthe southern side.\r\n\r\nMurphy, who was in charge of all the stores, saw that a good stock of\r\nfood was accessible in the veranda. Here he put up shelves and unpacked\r\ncases, so that samples of everything were at hand on the shortest\r\nnotice. Liquids liable to freeze and burst their bottles were taken into\r\nthe Hut.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of the main base, Adelie Land\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready we had several times seized the opportunity of a calm hour to\r\ntake out the whale-boat and assist Hunter to set traps and make a few\r\nhauls with the hand-dredge. Even in five fathoms, bright red and brown\r\nstar-fish had been caught in the trap, as well as numerous specimens of\r\na common Antarctic fish known as 'Notothenia'. In ten fathoms and over\r\nthe results were better, though in no case was the catch so abundant\r\nas one would expect from the amount of life in the water. The luxuriant\r\nkelp probably interfered with the proper working of the traps. Fish of\r\nthe same species as the above were caught on a hand-line.\r\n\r\nHunter, our biologist, was very unfortunate in crushing some of his\r\nfingers while carrying a heavy case. This accident came at a time when\r\nhe had just recovered from a severe strain of the knee-joint which he\r\nsuffered during our activities in the Queen's Wharf shed at Hobart.\r\nSeveral of us were just going out to the traps one afternoon when the\r\ncasualty occurred. Hunter was very anxious to go, so we waited until\r\nMcLean had sewn up a couple of his fingertips.\r\n\r\nWeddell, and with them occasional crab-eater seals, were at this time\r\nalways to be found in numbers sleeping on the ice-foot around the boat\r\nharbour. It appeared as if we would have plenty of meat throughout the\r\nyear, so I waited until the building was completed before laying in a\r\nstock. The penguins, however, were diminishing in numbers fast and the\r\nyoung birds in the rookeries had grown very large and were beginning to\r\nmigrate to warmer regions. Several parties, therefore, raided them and\r\nsecured some hundreds for the winter.\r\n\r\nGiant petrels and skua gulls swarmed in flocks round the seals' and\r\npenguins' carcases. These scavengers demolish an incredible amount of\r\nmeat and blubber in a short time. It is a diabolical sight to witness a\r\ngroup of birds tearing out the viscera of a seal, dancing the while with\r\nwings outspread.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon of February 11 Webb came in with the news that a\r\nsea elephant was making its way over the rocks near the shore. We rushed\r\nout in time to see it standing over Johnson, one of the dogs, who,\r\ntrue to his name, did not look abashed. Attracted by more formidable\r\nantagonists, the monster left Johnson and came towards us. He was a\r\nfair-sized male with a good skin, so we shot him before he had time to\r\nget back into the sea. His measurements were seventeen feet six inches\r\nin length and twelve feet in maximum circumference.\r\n\r\nWith the temperature well below freezing-point, skinning is cold work in\r\nthe wind, and must be done before the animal has time to freeze stiff. A\r\nnumber of us set to work flaying. In order to move the mountain of flesh\r\na Westing purchase and a \"handy-billy\" (rope and block purchase) had to\r\nbe rigged. It was several hours before everything was disposed of; the\r\nskin and skull for the biological collection and the meat and blubber\r\nfor the dogs. Ninnis and Mertz, who were the wardens of the dogs, cut up\r\nabout one ton of meat and blubber, and stored it as a winter reserve for\r\ntheir charges.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that sea elephants are sub-antarctic in\r\ndistribution, and only rarely have these animals been observed on the\r\nshores of the Antarctic continent. As far as I am aware, the only other\r\noccasion of such an occurrence was noted by Captain Scott in MacMurdo\r\nSound. Wilkes reported many of them on the pack-ice to the north of the\r\nBalleny Islands, so possibly they have a stronghold in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, ever since their arrival ashore, had been chained up on the\r\nrocks below the Hut. The continuous wind worried them a good deal,\r\nbut they had a substantial offset to the cold in a plentiful supply of\r\nseal-meat. On the whole, they were in a much better condition then when\r\nthey left the 'Aurora'. Nineteen in all, they had an odd assemblage\r\nof names, which seemed to grow into them until nothing else was so\r\nsuitable: Basilisk, Betli, Caruso, Castor, Franklin, Fusilier, Gadget,\r\nGeorge, Ginger, Ginger Bitch, Grandmother, Haldane, Jappy, John Bull,\r\nJohnson, Mary, Pavlova, Scott and Shackleton. Grandmother would have\r\nbeen better known as Grandfather. He was said to have a grandmotherly\r\nappearance; that is why he received the former name. The head dog was\r\nBasilisk, and next to him came Shackleton.\r\n\r\nEarly in February, after having experienced nothing but a succession\r\nof gales for nearly a month, I was driven to conclude that the average\r\nlocal weather must be much more windy than in any other part of\r\nAntarctica. The conditions were not at all favourable for sledging,\r\nwhich I had hoped to commence as soon as the Hut was completed. Now that\r\nthe time had arrived and the weather was still adverse, it seemed clear\r\nthat our first duty was to see everything snug for the winter before\r\nmaking an attempt.\r\n\r\nHannam, assisted by Bickerton, Madigan and others, had laid heavy and\r\nfirm foundations for the petrol-motor and generator. The floor of the\r\nsmaller room was then built around these bed-plates, and last of\r\nall came the walls and roof. Murphy, Bage and Hodgeman were chiefly\r\nresponsible for the last-named, which was practically completed by\r\nFebruary 10. Minor additions and modifications were added after that\r\ndate. Meanwhile, Hannam continued to unpack and mount the instruments\r\nforming the wireless plants. Along one wall and portion of another, in\r\nthe outer hut, a bench was built for mechanical work and for scientific\r\npurposes. This was in future to be the work-room.\r\n\r\nOur home had attained to a stage of complex perfection. To penetrate to\r\nthe inside hut, the stranger reverently steps through a hole in the snow\r\nto the veranda, then by way of a vestibule with an inner and outer door\r\nhe has invaded the privacy of the work-room, from which with fear and\r\ntrembling he passes by a third door into the sanctum sanctorum. Later,\r\nwhen the snow-tunnel system came into vogue, the place became another\r\nLabyrinth of Minos.\r\n\r\nThe three doors were fitted with springs to keep them shut unless they\r\nwere jammed open for ventilation, which was at once obtained by opening\r\nan aperture in the cooking-range flue. A current of air would then\r\ncirculate through the open doors. The roof windows were immovable and\r\nsealed on the inside by a thick accumulation of ice. An officer of\r\npublic health, unacquainted with the climate of Adelie Land, would be\r\ninclined to regard the absence of more adequate ventilation as a serious\r\nomission. It would enlighten him to know that much of our spare time,\r\nfor a month after the completion of the building, was spent in plugging\r\noff draughts which found their way through most unexpected places, urged\r\nby a wind-pressure from without of many pounds to the square foot.\r\n\r\nExcepting the small portion used as an entrance-porch, the verandas were\r\nleft without any better flooring than well-trodden snow. In the boarded\r\nfloor of the porch was a trap-door which led down into a shallow\r\ncellar extending under a portion of the work-room. The cellar was a\r\nrefrigerating chamber for fresh meat and contained fifteen carcases of\r\nmutton, besides piles of seal-meat and penguins.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for our contemplated sledging, masts, spars and\r\nsails were fitted to some of the sledges, rations were prepared and\r\nalterations made to harness and clothing. Soon a sledge stood packed,\r\nready to set out on the first fine day.\r\n\r\nFor several days in succession, about the middle of February, the\r\notherwise continuous wind fell off to a calm for several hours in the\r\nevening. On those occasions Mertz gave us some fine exhibitions of\r\nskiing, of which art he was a consummate master. Skis had been provided\r\nfor every one, in case we should have to traverse a country where the\r\nsnow lay soft and deep. From the outset, there was little chance of that\r\nbeing the case in wind-scoured Adelie Land. Nevertheless, most of the\r\nmen seized the few opportunities we had to become more practiced in\r\ntheir use. My final opinion, however, was that if we had all been\r\nexperts like Mertz, we could have used them with advantage from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe end of February approached. We were fully prepared for sledging,\r\nand were looking forward to it with great expectation. The wind still\r\ncontinued, often rising to the force of a hurricane, and was mostly\r\naccompanied by snow.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when we were all at dinner, there was a sudden noise which\r\ndrowned the rush of the blizzard. It was found that several sledges had\r\nbeen blown away from their position to the south of the Hut, striking\r\nthe building as they passed. They were all rescued except one, which had\r\nalready reached the sea and was travelling rapidly toward Australia.\r\n\r\nMertz, Bage and I had taken advantage of a lull to ascend the ice-slope\r\nto the south, and to erect a flag-pole at a distance of two miles.\r\nBesides being a beacon for sledging parties, it was used for ablation\r\nmeasurements. These were determinations of the annual wasting of the\r\nice-surface, whether by evaporation, melting, or wind-abrasion.\r\n\r\nWebb and Stillwell, assisted by others, had commenced to build the\r\nMagnetograph House. Dr. Chree, of the British National Physical\r\nLaboratory, had arranged that the German Antarctic Expedition, several\r\nobservatories in low latitudes and our own Expedition, should take\r\nspecial \"quick runs,\" synchronously, twice each month. A \"quick run\" was\r\na continuous, careful observation made over a period of two hours, on a\r\nmore searching time-scale then usual. Until the Magnetograph House was\r\nestablished this could not be done efficiently, and so the construction\r\nof this hut was pushed on as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nMany other schemes required our attention, and there was not a spare\r\nmoment for any one. Though we chafed at the delay in sledging, there\r\nwas some consolation in the fact that the scientific programme was daily\r\nbecoming more and more complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI AUTUMN PROSPECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as we could see, the inland ice was an unbroken plateau with no\r\nnatural landmarks. From the hinterland in a vast solid stream the ice\r\nflowed, with heavily crevassed downfalls near the coast. Traversing this\r\nfrom north to south was a narrow belt, reasonably free from pitfalls,\r\nrunning as a spur down to the sea. To reach the Hut in safety it would\r\nbe necessary for sledging parties returning from the interior to descend\r\nby this highway. The problem was to locate the path. Determinations\r\nof latitude and longitude would guide them to the neighbourhood of\r\nCommonwealth Bay, but the coastline in the vicinity of Winter Quarters,\r\nwith the rocks and islets, would not come into view until within two\r\nmiles, as above that point the icy slopes filled the foreground up to\r\nthe distant berg-studded horizon. Delays in reaching the Hut owing to\r\nthe difficult descent might have serious consequences, for provisions\r\nare usually short near the conclusion of a sledging journey.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of making artificial landmarks was, therefore, most\r\nobvious. Already we had a flagstaff two miles to the south. It was now\r\nmy intention to run a line of similar marks backwards to the plateau.\r\n\r\nBage, Madigan and I were to form a reconnoitring party to plant\r\nthese flags, and to make a journey of a few days' duration into the\r\nhinterland, to see its possibilities, and with a view to an extended\r\nsledging campaign to commence as soon as possible after our return. It\r\nwas decided not to make use of the dogs until later in the year, when\r\nthey would be in better form.\r\n\r\nThe wind continued, accompanied by more or less drift-snow. This\r\nappeared to be the settled state of the weather. We decided to move out\r\nas soon as a moderate phase should occur.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of February 28 the weather cleared up for several\r\nhours, and we decided to leave on the following day. The wind resumed\r\noperations once more, but fell off late on February 29, when we made a\r\nstart. We intended to get the packed sledge up the first steep slope,\r\nthere to leave it until the morrow. The drift was slight and low,\r\nflowing along like a stream below our knees. Bickerton, Hurley and Mertz\r\nassisted us with the hauling. At a distance of a little more than a\r\nmile, at an elevation of five hundred feet, the sledge was anchored and\r\nwe returned to the Hut for the night.\r\n\r\nNext morning the weather cleared still more, and we left just before\r\nnoon. Three miles out, a mast and flag were erected, when our companions\r\nof the day before, who had again assisted us, turned back. At five and\r\na half miles the brow of the main rise was reached, and the gradient\r\nbecame much flatter beyond it. The elevation was found to be one\r\nthousand five hundred feet.\r\n\r\nTo the south nothing was visible but a great, wan, icy wilderness. To\r\nthe north a headland appeared on either hand, each about twenty-five\r\nmiles away, and between them lay an expanse of sea dotted with many\r\nbergs. The nearer portions of the coast, together with the Mackellar\r\nIslets, were lost to view on account of the curvature of the foreground.\r\n\r\nDuring most of the day we had travelled over a surface of clear ice,\r\nmarked by occasional scars where fissuring, now healed, had at some time\r\ntaken place. Beyond the three-mile flag, however, the ice was gashed at\r\nfrequent intervals, producing irregular crevasses, usually a few yards\r\nin length and, for the most part, choked with snow. At five and a half\r\nmiles we were on the edge of a strip of snow, half a mile across,\r\nwhose whiteness was thrown in dazzling contrast against the foil of\r\ntransparent, dark ice.\r\n\r\nIt was dusk, and light drift commenced to scud by, so, as this was a\r\nsuitable place to erect a flag, we decided to camp for the night. Some\r\nhours later I woke up to hear a blizzard blowing outside, and to find\r\nMadigan fumbling amongst some gear at the head-end of the tent. From\r\ninside my bag I called out to inquire if there was anything wrong, and\r\nreceived a reply that he was looking for the primus-pricker. Then he\r\nslipped back into his sleeping-bag, and all became quiet, except for\r\nthe snow beating against the tent. So I presumed that he had found it.\r\nRevolving the incident in my mind, and dimly wondering what use he\r\ncould have for a primus-pricker in the middle of the night, I again fell\r\nasleep. In the morning the blizzard was still blowing, accompanied by a\r\ngood deal of drift. On inquiry I found that Madigan knew nothing of his\r\nmidnight escapade. It was a touch of somnambulism.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no useful purpose to go on in thick drift, for the main\r\nobject of our journey was to define the best route through the\r\ncrevassed zone; and that could only be done on a clear day. I decided,\r\naccordingly, that if the weather did not improve by noon to leave the\r\nsledge with the gear and walk back to the Hut, intending to make another\r\nattempt when conditions became more settled.\r\n\r\nWhilst the others erected a flagstaff and froze the legs of a\r\ndrift-proof box (containing a thermograph) into the ice, I made lunch\r\nand prepared for our departure. The tent was taken down and everything\r\nlashed securely on the sledge.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly 3 P.M. when we set out in thick drift, and in two hours we\r\nwere at the Hut; the weather having steadily improved as we descended.\r\nOn comparing notes with those at home it appeared that we, at the\r\nfifteen hundred feet level, had experienced much more wind and drift\r\nthan they at sea-level.\r\n\r\nWebb and his assistants were beginning to make quite a display at the\r\nMagnetograph House. The framework, which had already been erected once,\r\nto be demolished by the wind, was now strongly rebuilt and was ready for\r\nthe outside covering of boards.\r\n\r\nFrom the night of our return to March 8 there was a high wind\r\naccompanied by much drift; for some hours it continued at eighty miles\r\nper hour, the mean temperature being about 15 degrees F., with a minimum\r\nof 5 degrees F.\r\n\r\nUp to this date the dogs had been kept on the chain, on account of their\r\ndepredations amongst the seals and penguins. The severe weather now made\r\nit necessary to release them. Thenceforth, their abode for part of the\r\nday was inside the veranda, where a section was barricaded-off for\r\ntheir exclusive use. Outside in heavy drift their habit was to take up\r\na position in the lee of some large object, such as the Hut. In such a\r\nposition they were soon completely buried and oblivious to the outside\r\nelements. Thus one would sometimes tread on a dog, hidden beneath the\r\nsnow; and the dog often showed less surprise than the offending man.\r\nWhat the dogs detested most of all during the blizzard-spells was the\r\ndrift-snow filling their eyes until they were forced to stop and brush\r\nit away frantically with their paws. Other inconveniences were the icy\r\ncasing which formed from the thawing snow on their thick coats, and\r\nthe fact that when they lay in one position, especially on ice, for any\r\nlength of time they become frozen down, and only freed themselves at\r\nthe expense of tufts of hair. In high winds, accompanied by a low\r\ntemperature, they were certainly very miserable, unless in some kind of\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nSeveral families were born at this time, but although we did everything\r\npossible for them they all perished, except one; the offspring of\r\nGadget. This puppy was called \"Blizzard.\" It was housed for a while in\r\nthe veranda and, later on, in the Hangar. Needless to say, Blizzard was\r\na great favourite and much in demand as a pet.\r\n\r\nOn the night of March 7, Caruso, who had been in poor condition for some\r\ntime, was found to have a gaping wound around the neck. It was a clean\r\ncut, an inch deep and almost a foot in length. The cause was never\r\nsatisfactorily explained, though a piece of strong string embedded in\r\nthe wound evidently made the incision. Caruso was brought inside, and,\r\nwhilst Whetter administered chloroform, McLean sewed up the wound. After\r\ncareful attention for some days, it healed fairly well, but as the dog's\r\ngeneral health was worse, it was deemed advisable to shoot him.\r\n\r\nThe outer shell of the Magnetograph House was nearly completed,\r\naffording a protection for those who worked on the interior linings.\r\nWhen completed, the walls and roof consisted of two coverings of tongued\r\nand grooved pine boards and three layers of thick tarred paper.\r\n\r\nWhile there still remained a breach in the wall, Hurley repaired there\r\nwith his cinematograph camera and took a film showing the clouds of\r\ndrift-snow whirling past. In those days we were not educated in methods\r\nof progression against heavy winds; so, in order to get Hurley and his\r\nbulky camera back to the Hut, we formed a scrum on the windward side and\r\nwith a strong \"forward\" rush beat our formidable opponent.\r\n\r\nOn March 8 the blizzard died away and a good day followed. All hands\r\njoined in building a solid stone outside of the Magnetograph House. This\r\npiece of work, in which thirty tons of rock were utilized, was completed\r\non the following day. The wall reached almost to the roof on every side.\r\nThe unprotected roof was lagged with sacks and sheep-skins and, after\r\nthis had been effected, the hut became practically windtight. The\r\nexternal covering controlled the influx of cold from the penetrating\r\nwinds, and, on the other hand, the conduction of the sun's warmth in\r\nsummer. Thus a steady temperature was maintained; a most desirable\r\nfeature in a magnetograph house. Webb had the instruments set up in a\r\nfew days, and they were working before the end of the month.\r\n\r\nAfter the calm of March 8, the wind steadily increased and became worse\r\nthan ever. Madigan, who was in charge of the whale-boat, kept it moored\r\nin the boat-harbour under shelter of the ice-foot. An excursion was made\r\nto the fish traps, buoyed half a mile off shore, on February 8, and it\r\nwas found that one had been carried away in the hurricane. The other was\r\nbrought in very much battered. That night it was decided at the first\r\nopportunity to haul up the boat and house it for the winter. Alas! the\r\nwind came down again too quickly, increasing in force, with dense drift.\r\nIt was still in full career on the 12th, when Madigan came in with\r\nthe news that the boat had disappeared. It was no fault of the\r\nrope-attachments for they were securely made and so we were left to\r\nconclude that a great mass of ice had broken away from the overhanging\r\nshelf and carried everything before it.\r\n\r\nThe regularity of the high-velocity winds was already recognized as\r\none of the most remarkable features of Adelie Land. By itself such\r\nwind would have been bad enough, but, accompanied by dense volumes of\r\ndrifting snow, it effectually put a stop to most outdoor occupations.\r\n\r\nThe roof and walls of the veranda being covered with a single layer\r\nof tongued and grooved boards, the snow drove through every chink.\r\nThe cases outside were a partial protection, but the cracks were\r\ninnumerable, and in the course of twenty-four hours the snow inside had\r\ncollected in deep drifts. This required to be shovelled out each day or\r\nthe veranda would have been entirely blocked.\r\n\r\nMuch time was spent endeavouring to make it drift-tight; but as the\r\nmaterials at our disposal were very limited, the result was never\r\nabsolutely satisfactory. The small veranda serving as an entrance-porch\r\nwas deluged with snow which drove in past the canvas doorway. The only\r\nway to get over this trouble was to shovel out the accumulations every\r\nmorning. On one occasion, when Close was nightwatchman, the drift poured\r\nthrough in such volume that each time he wished to go outside it took\r\nhim half an hour to dig his way out. On account of this periodic influx,\r\nthe vestibule doorway to the workroom was moved to the other end of the\r\nwall, where the invading snow had farther to travel and was consequently\r\nless obstructive.\r\n\r\nOne advantage of the deposit of snow around the Hut was that all\r\ndraughts were sealed off. Before this happened it was found very\r\ndifficult to keep the inside temperature up to 40 deg. F. A temperature\r\ntaken within the Hut varied according to the specific position in\r\nreference to the walls and stove. That shown by the thermometer attached\r\nto the standard barometer, which was suspended near the centre of the\r\nroom, was taken as the \"hut temperature\". Near the floor and walls it\r\nwas lower, and higher, of course, near the stove. On one occasion,\r\nin the early days, I remember the \"hut temperature\" being 19 deg. F.,\r\nnotwithstanding the heat from the large range. Under these conditions\r\nthe writing-ink and various solutions all over the place froze, and,\r\nwhen the night-watchman woke up the shivering community he had many\r\nclamorous demands to satisfy. The photographer produced an interesting\r\nproduct from the dark room--a transparent cast of a developing-dish in\r\nwhich a photographic plate left overnight to wash was firmly set.\r\n\r\nWe arranged to maintain an inside temperature of 40 degrees F.; when it\r\nrose to 50 degrees F. means were taken to reduce it. The cooking-range,\r\na large one designed to burn anthracite coal, was the general warming\r\napparatus. To raise the temperature quickly, blocks of seal blubber, of\r\nwhich there was always a supply at hand, were used. The coal consumption\r\naveraged one hundred pounds a day, approximately, this being reduced at\r\na later date to seventy-five pounds by employing a special damper for\r\nthe chimney. The damper designed for ordinary climates allowed too\r\nmuch draught to be sucked through during the high winds which prevailed\r\ncontinually.\r\n\r\nThe chimney was fitted with a cowl which had to be specially secured to\r\nkeep it in place. During heavy drifts the cowl became choked with snow\r\nand ice, and the Hut would rapidly fill with smoke until some one,\r\nhurriedly donning burberrys, rushed out with an ice-axe to chip an\r\noutlet for the draught. The chimney was very short and securely stayed,\r\nprojecting through the lee side of the roof, where the pressure of the\r\nwind was least felt.\r\n\r\nThe first good display of aurora polaris was witnessed during the\r\nevening of March 12, though no doubt there had been other exhibitions\r\nobscured by the drift. As the days went by and the equinox drew near,\r\nauroral phenomena were with few exceptions visible on clear evenings. In\r\nthe majority of cases they showed up low in the northern sky.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a torment of wind, March 15 came as a beautiful, sunny,\r\nalmost calm day. I remarked in my diary that it was \"typical Antarctic\r\nweather,\" thinking of those halcyon days which belong to the climate of\r\nthe southern shores of the Ross Sea. In Adelie Land, we were destined to\r\nfind, it was hard to number more than a dozen or two in the year.\r\n\r\nA fine day! the psychological effect was remarkable; pessimism vanished,\r\nand we argued that with the passing of the equinox there would be a\r\nmarked change for the better. Not a moment was lost: some were employed\r\nin making anchorages for the wireless masts; others commenced to\r\nconstruct a Hangar to house the air-tractor sledge.\r\n\r\nIn building the Hangar, the western wall of the Hut was used for one\r\nside; the low southern end and the western wall were constructed of full\r\nand empty cases, the lee side was closed with a tarpaulin and blocks\r\nof snow and over all was nailed a roof of thick timber--part of the\r\nair-tractor's case. To stiffen the whole structure, a small amount of\r\nframework, in the form of heavy uprights, was set in the ground. The\r\ndimensions inside were thirty-four feet by eleven feet; the height,\r\neleven feet at the northern and six feet at the southern end. As a\r\nbreak-wind a crescent-shaped wall of benzine cases was built several\r\nyards to the south. As in the case of the veranda, it was very difficult\r\nto make the Hangar impervious to drift; a certain quantity of snow\r\nalways made its way in, and was duly shovelled out.\r\n\r\nSeals had suddenly become very scarce, no doubt disgusted with the\r\ncontinuous winds. Every one that came ashore was shot for food.\r\nUnfortunately, the amount of meat necessary for the dogs throughout the\r\nwinter was so great that dog-biscuits had to be used to eke it out.\r\n\r\nOnly a few penguins remained by the middle of March. They were all young\r\nones, waiting for the completion of their second moult before taking to\r\nthe sea. The old feathers hung in untidy tufts, and the birds were often\r\nin a wretched plight owing to the wind and drift-snow. Many were added\r\nto the bleaching carcases which fill the crevices or lie in heaps\r\non ancient rookeries among the rocky ridges. None were free from the\r\nencumbrance of hard cakes of snow which often covered their eyes or\r\ndangled in pendent icicles from their bodies. The result was very\r\nludicrous.\r\n\r\nHurley obtained some excellent photographs of the seals and penguins, as\r\nof all other subjects. So good were they that most of us withdrew\r\nfrom competition. His enthusiasm and resourcefulness knew no bounds.\r\nOccasional days, during which cameras that had been maltreated by the\r\nwind were patched up, were now looked upon as inevitable. One day, when\r\nWebb and Hurley were both holding on to the cinematograph camera, they\r\nwere blown away, with sundry damages all around. It was later in\r\nthe year when Hurley with his whole-plate camera broke through the\r\nsea-ice--a sad affair for the camera.\r\n\r\nThe good conditions on the 15th lasted only a few hours, and back came\r\nthe enemy as bad as ever. On the 18th the wind was only thirty miles per\r\nhour, giving us an opportunity of continuing the buildings outside.\r\nIt was only by making the most of every odd hour when the weather was\r\ntolerable that our outdoor enterprises made any headway. Sometimes when\r\nit was too windy for building we were able to improve our knowledge of\r\nthe neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nA glance at Stillwell's map is instruct*e as to the extent and character\r\nof the rocky area. It is devoid of any forms of vegetation sufficiently\r\nprominent to meet the casual eye. Soil is lacking, for all light\r\nmaterials and even gravel are carried away by the winds. The bare rock\r\nrises up into miniature ridges, separated by valleys largely occupied\r\nby ice-slabs and lakelets. Snow fills all the crevices and tails away\r\nin sloping ramps on the lee side of every obstacle. In midsummer a good\r\ndeal thaws, and, re-freezing, is converted into ice. The highest point\r\nof the rock is one hundred and forty feet. The seaward margin is deeply\r\nindented, and the islets off shore tell of a continuation of the rugged,\r\nrocky surface below the sea. On the northern faces of the ridges,\r\nfronting the ice-foot, large, yellowish patches mark the sites of\r\npenguin rookeries. These are formed by a superficial deposit of guano\r\nwhich never becomes thick, for it blows away as fast as it accumulates.\r\nStanding on the shore, one can see kelp growing amongst the rocks even\r\nin the shallowest spots, below low-water level.\r\n\r\nTo the south, the rocks are overridden by the inland ice which bears\r\ndown upon and overwhelms them. The ice-sheet shows a definite basal\r\nmoraine, which means that the lowest stratum, about forty feet in\r\nthickness, is charged with stones and earthy matter. Above this stratum\r\nthe ice is free from foreign matter and rises steeply to several hundred\r\nfeet, after which the ascending gradient is reduced.\r\n\r\nThe continental glacier moves down to the sea, regularly but slowly; the\r\nrate of movement of some portions of the adjacent coastal ice cliffs was\r\nfound to be one hundred feet per annum. The rocky promontory at Winter\r\nQuarters, acting as an obstacle, reduces the motion of the ice to\r\nan annual rate measured in inches only. Perhaps the conditions now\r\nprevailing are those of a comparative \"drought,\" for there is clear\r\nevidence that our small promontory was at one time completely enveloped.\r\nIn a broad way this is illustrated by the topography, but the final\r\nproof came when Stillwell and others discovered rock-faces polished and\r\ngrooved by the ice.\r\n\r\nWhatever \"ice-floods\" there may have been in the past, the position of\r\nthe margin of the glacier must have remained for a long period in its\r\npresent situation. The evidence for this is found in the presence of\r\na continuous, terminal moraine, at or just in advance of the present\r\nice-front. This moraine, an accumulation of stones of all kinds brought\r\nto their present resting-place by the ice-sheet, was in itself a\r\nveritable museum. Rocks, showing every variety in colour and form, were\r\nassembled, transported from far and wide over the great expanse of the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nA section of the coastal slope of the Continental Ice Sheet inland from\r\nWinter Quarters, Adelie Land\r\n\r\n\r\nStillwell found these moraines a \"happy hunting-ground\" for the\r\ngeologist. His plane-table survey and rock collections are practical\r\nevidence of work carried out in weather which made it seldom short of an\r\nordeal.\r\n\r\nThe story of the buried land to the south is in large measure revealed\r\nin the samples brought by the ice and so conveniently dumped. Let us\r\nswiftly review the operations leading to the deposition of this natural\r\nmuseum.\r\n\r\nAs the ice of the hinterland moves forward, it plucks fragments from\r\nthe rocky floor. Secure in its grip, these are used as graving-tools\r\nto erode its bed. Throwing its whole weight upon them it grinds and\r\nscratches, pulverizes and grooves. The rocky basement is gradually\r\nreduced in level, especially the softer regions. The tools are faceted,\r\npolished and furrowed, for ever moving onwards. Finally, the rock-powder\r\nor \"rock-flour,\" as it is termed, and the boulders, thenceforth known\r\nas \"erratics,\" arrive at the terminal ice-face. Here, the melting due to\r\nthe sun's heat keeps pace with the \"on-thrust\" and some of the erratics\r\nmay remain stationary, or else, floating in the sea, a berg laden with\r\nboulders breaks off and deposits its load in the depths of the ocean.\r\nEach summer the ice-face above the rocks at Winter Quarters thawed back\r\na short distance and the water ran away in rivulets, milky-white on\r\naccount of the \"rock-flour\" in suspension. The pebbles and boulders too\r\nheavy to be washed away remained behind to form the moraine.\r\n\r\nThe \"erratics\" comprised a great variety of metamorphic and igneous\r\nrocks, and, on a more limited scale, sedimentary types. Amongst the\r\nlatter were sandstones, slates, shales and limestones.\r\n\r\nApart from the moraines, the rock exposed in situ was mainly a uniform\r\ntype of gneiss, crumpled and folded, showing all the signs of great\r\nantiquity--pre-Cambrian, in the geological phrase. Relieving the grey\r\nsheen of the gneiss were dark bands of schist which tracked about in an\r\nirregular manner. Sporadic quartz veins here and there showed a light\r\ntint. They were specially interesting, for they carried some less common\r\nminerals such as beryl, tourmaline, garnet, coarse mica and ores of\r\niron, copper and molybdenum. The ores were present in small quantities,\r\nbut gave promise of larger bodies in the vicinity and indicated the\r\nprobability of mineral wealth beneath the continental ice-cap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII THE BLIZZARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equinox arrived, and the only indication of settled weather was a\r\nmore marked regularity in the winds. Nothing like it had been reported\r\nfrom any part of the world. Any trace of elation we may have felt at\r\nthis meteorological discovery could not compensate for the ever-present\r\ndiscomforts of life. Day after day the wind fluctuated between a gale\r\nand a hurricane. Overcast skies of heavy nimbus cloud were the rule and\r\nthe air was continually charged with drifting snow.\r\n\r\nLulls of a singular nature occasionally relieved the monotony. During\r\nthese visitations the sequence of events could almost be predicted;\r\nindeed, they would often occur at the same time on several succeeding\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nOn March 19 the first well-marked lull intervened at the height of a\r\ngale. On that day the wind, which had been blowing with great force\r\nduring the morning, commenced to subside rapidly just after noon.\r\nTowards evening, the air about the Hut was quite still except for gusts\r\nfrom the north and rather frequent \"whirlies.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the name adopted for whirlwinds of a few yards to a hundred\r\nyards or more in diameter which came to be regarded as peculiar to the\r\ncountry. Similar disturbances have been observed in every part of the\r\nworld, but seldom possessed of the same violence and regularity as is\r\nthe case in Adelie Land.\r\n\r\nThe whirlies tracked about in a most irregular manner and woe betide any\r\nlight object which came in their path. The velocity of the wind in the\r\nrotating column being very great, a corresponding lifting power was\r\nimparted to it. As an illustration of this force, it may be mentioned\r\nthat the lid of the air-tractor case had been left lying on the snow\r\nnear the Hut. It weighed more than three hundredweights, yet it was\r\nwhisked into the air one morning and dropped fifty yards away in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction. An hour afterwards it was picked up again and\r\nreturned near its original position, this time striking the rocks with\r\nsuch force that part of it was shivered to pieces. Webb and Stillwell\r\nwatched the last proceeding at a respectful distance.\r\n\r\nAgain, the radius of activity of these whirlies was strictly limited;\r\nobjects directly in their path only being disturbed. For instance,\r\nLaseron one day was skinning at one end of a seal and remained in\r\nperfect calm, while McLean, at the other extremity, was on the edge of a\r\nfurious vortex.\r\n\r\nTravelling over the sea the whirlies displayed fresh capabilities.\r\nColumns of brash-ice, frozen spray and water-vapour were frequently seen\r\nlifted to heights of from two hundred to four hundred feet, simulating\r\nwater spouts.\r\n\r\nReverting to the afternoon of March 19. Beyond the strange stillness of\r\nthe immediate vicinity, broken occasionally by the tumult of a passing,\r\nwandering whirly, an incessant, seething roar could be heard. One could\r\nnot be certain from whence it came, but it seemed to proceed either\r\nfrom the south or overhead. Away on the icy promontories to the east and\r\nwest, where the slopes were visible, mounting to an altitude of several\r\nthousand feet, clouds of drift-snow blotted out the details of the\r\nsurface above a level of about six hundred feet. It certainly appeared\r\nas if the gale, for some reason, had lifted and was still raging\r\noverhead. At 7.30 P.M. the sound we had heard, like the distant lashing\r\nof ocean waves, became louder. Soon gusts swept the tops of the rocky\r\nridges, gradually descending to throw up the snow at a lower level.\r\nThen a volley raked the Hut, and within a few minutes we were once more\r\nenveloped in a sea of drifting snow, and the wind blew stronger than\r\never.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the lulls was ordinarily from a few minutes to several\r\nhours; that of March 19 was longer than usual. In the course of time,\r\nafter repeated observations, much light was thrown on this phenomenon.\r\nOn one occasion, a party ascending the ice slopes to the south met the\r\nwind blowing at an elevation of four hundred feet. At the same time\r\nsnow could be seen pouring over the \"Barrier\" to the west of the Winter\r\nQuarters, and across a foaming turmoil of water. This was evidently the\r\nmain cause of the seething roar, but it was mingled with an undernote\r\nof deeper tone from the upland plateau--like the wind in a million\r\ntree-tops.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring, while we were transporting provisions to the\r\nsouth, frequent journeys were made to higher elevations. It was then\r\nestablished that even when whole days of calm prevailed at the Hut, the\r\nwind almost without exception blew above a level of one thousand\r\nfeet. On such occasions it appeared that the gale was impelled to blow\r\nstraight out from the plateau slopes over a lower stratum of dead-air.\r\nAn explanation was thereby afforded of the movement of condensation\r\nclouds which appeared in the zenith at these times. A formation of\r\ndelicate, gauzy clouds developed at a low altitude, apparently in still\r\nair, but doubtless at the base of a hurricane stratum. Whirling round\r\nrapidly in eddying flocculi, they quickly tailed away to the north,\r\nevaporating and disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe auditory sense was strangely affected by these lulls. The contrast\r\nwas so severe when the racking gusts of an abating wind suddenly gave\r\nway to intense, eerie silence, that the habitual droning of many weeks\r\nwould still reverberate in the ears. At night one would involuntarily\r\nwake up if the wind died away, and be loth to sleep \"for the hunger of\r\na sound.\" In the open air the stillness conveyed to the brain an\r\nimpression of audibility, interpreted as a vibratory murmur.\r\n\r\nDuring one hour on March 22 it blew eighty-six miles. On the morning\r\nof that day there was not much snow in the air and the raging sea was a\r\nfearful sight. Even the nearest of the islands, only half a mile off the\r\nland, was partially hidden in the clouds of spray. What an impossible\r\ncoast this would be for the wintering of a ship!\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that the pressure exerted by a wind against an object in\r\nits path mounts up in much greater proportion than the velocity of the\r\nwind. Thus may be realized the stupendous force of the winds of Adelie\r\nLand in comparison with those of half the velocity which fall within\r\none's ordinary experience. As this subject was ever before us, the\r\nfollowing figures quoted from a work of reference will be instructive.\r\nThe classification of winds, here stated, is that known as the \"Beaufort\r\nscale.\" The corresponding velocities in each case are those measured\r\nby the \"Robinson patent\" anemometer; our instrument being of a similar\r\npattern\r\n\r\n  ___________________________________________________________________\r\n  Beaufort scale    |Velocities|Pressures |     Apparent effect     |\r\n                    | in miles | in lbs.  |                         |\r\n                    | per hour | square   |                         |\r\n                    |            foot     |                         |\r\n                    |          |  area    |                         |\r\n  __________________|__________| _________|_________________________|\r\n   0|Calm           |    2     |    0.02  |May cause smoke to       |\r\n    |               |          |          |   move form vertical    |\r\n   1|Light air      |    4     |    0.06  |Moves the leaves of trees|\r\n   2|Light breeze   |    7     |    0.19  |Moves small branches of  |\r\n   3|Gentle breeze  |   10     |    0.37  | trees and blows up dust |\r\n   4|Moderate breeze|   14     |    0.67  |                         |\r\n   5|Fresh breeze   |   19     |    1.16  |Good sailing breeze and  |\r\n   6|Strong breeze  |   25     |    1.90  |  makes white caps       |\r\n   7|Moderate gale  |   31     |    2.81  |Sways trees and breaks   |\r\n   8|Fresh gale     |   37     |    3.87  |  small branches         |\r\n   9|Strong gale    |   44     |    5.27  |Dangerous for sailing    |\r\n  10|Whole gale     |   53     |    7.40  |   vessels               |\r\n  11|Storm          |   64     |   10.40  |Prostrates exposed trees |\r\n  12|Hurricane      |   77     |   14.40  |    and frail houses     |\r\n  ___________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the limits of this scale, the pressures exerted rise very\r\nrapidly. A wind recorded as blowing at the rate of a hundred miles per\r\nhour exerts a pressure of about twenty-three pounds per square foot of\r\nsurface exposed to it. Wind above eighty miles per hour is stated to\r\n\"prostrate everything.\"\r\n\r\nThe mileages registered by our anemometer were the mean for a whole\r\nhour, neglecting individual gusts, whose velocity much exceeded the\r\naverage and which were always the potent factors in destructive work.\r\n\r\nObviously the greatest care had to be taken to secure everything. Still,\r\narticles of value were occasionally missed. They were usually recovered,\r\ncaught in crevices of rock or amongst the broken ice. Northward from\r\nthe Hut there was a trail of miscellaneous objects scattered among the\r\nhummocks and pressure-ridges out towards Penguin Hill on the eastern\r\nside of the boat harbour: tins of all kinds and sizes, timber in small\r\nscraps, cases and boards, paper, ashes, dirt, worn-out finnesko, ragged\r\nmitts and all the other details of a rubbish heap. One of the losses\r\nwas a heavy case which formed the packing of part of the magnetometer.\r\nWeighted-down by stones this had stood for a long time in what was\r\nregarded as a safe place. One morning it was discovered to be missing.\r\nIt was surmised that a hurricane had started it on an ocean voyage\r\nduring the previous day. Boxes in which Whetter used to carry ice for\r\ndomestic requirements were as a rule short-lived. His problem was to\r\nfill the boxes without losing hold of them, and the wind often gained\r\nthe ascendancy before a sufficient ballast had been added. We sometimes\r\nwondered whether any of the flotsam thus cast upon the waters ever\r\nreached the civilized world.\r\n\r\nWhatever has been said relative to the wind-pressure exerted on\r\ninanimate objects, the same applied, with even more point, to our\r\npersons; so that progression in a hurricane became a fine art. The first\r\ndifficulty to be encountered was a smooth, slippery surface offering no\r\ngrip for the feet. Stepping out of the shelter of the Hut, one was apt\r\nto be immediately hurled at full length down wind. No amount of exertion\r\nwas of any avail unless a firm foothold had been secured. The strongest\r\nman, stepping on to ice or hard snow in plain leather or fur boots,\r\nwould start sliding away with gradually increasing velocity; in the\r\nspace of a few seconds, or earlier, exchanging the vertical for the\r\nhorizontal position. He would then either stop suddenly against a\r\njutting point of ice, or glide along for twenty or thirty yards till he\r\nreached a patch of rocks or some rough sastrugi.\r\n\r\nOf course we soon learned never to go about without crampons on the\r\nfeet. Many experiments in the manufacture of crampons were tried\r\nwith the limited materials at our disposal. Those designed for normal\r\nAntarctic conditions had been found unserviceable. A few detachable\r\npairs made of wrought iron with spikes about one and a half inches in\r\nlength, purchased in Switzerland, gave a secure foothold. Some of the\r\nmen covered the soles of their boots with long, bristling spikes and\r\nthese served their purpose well. Ice-nails, screwed into the soles\r\nwithout being riveted on plates, were liable to tear out when put to\r\na severe test, besides being too short. Spikes of less than an inch in\r\nlength were inadequate in hurricanes. Nothing devised by us gave the\r\ngrip of the Swiss crampons, but, to affix them, one had to wear leather\r\nboots, which, though padded to increase their warmth, had to be tightly\r\nbound by lashings compressing the feet and increasing the liability to\r\nfrost-bite.\r\n\r\nShod with good spikes, in a steady wind, one had only to push hard to\r\nkeep a sure footing. It would not be true to say \"to keep erect,\" for\r\nequilibrium was maintained by leaning against the wind. In course\r\nof time, those whose duties habitually took them out of doors became\r\nthorough masters of the art of walking in hurricanes--an accomplishment\r\ncomparable to skating or skiing. Ensconced in the lee of a substantial\r\nbreak-wind, one could leisurely observe the unnatural appearance of\r\nothers walking about, apparently in imminent peril of falling on their\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nExperiments were tried in the steady winds; firmly planting the feet\r\non the ground, keeping the body rigid and leaning over on the invisible\r\nsupport. This \"lying on the wind,\" at equilibrium, was a unique\r\nexperience. As a rule the velocity remained uniform; when it fluctuated\r\nin a series of gusts, all our experience was likely to fail, for no\r\nsooner had the correct angle for the maximum velocity been assumed than\r\na lull intervened--with the obvious result.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nA copy of the wind-velocity (anenometer) and the wind direction\r\n(anemograph) for a period of twenty-four hours, Adelie Land\r\n\r\nThis particular record illustrates a day of constant high velocity wind.\r\nIn the case of the upper chart each rise of the pen from the bottom to\r\nthe top of the paper indicates that another 100 miles of wind has passed\r\nthe instrument. The regularity of these curves shows the steadiness of\r\nthe wind. It will be observed that the average velocity for twenty-four\r\nhours was 90.1 miles, and the maximum of the average hourly velocities\r\nthroughout that period was ninety-seven miles. The lower chart, the\r\nrecord of the direction from which the wind blew, is marked only by a\r\nsingle broad bar in the position of South-by-East, the wind not having\r\nveered in the slightest degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the art of \"hurricane-walking\" was learnt, and in the primitive\r\ndays of ice-nails and finnesko, progression in high winds degenerated\r\ninto crawling on hands and knees. Many of the more conservative\r\npersisted in this method, and, as a compensation, became the first\r\nexponents of the popular art of \"board-sliding.\" A small piece of board,\r\na wide ice flat and a hurricane were the three essentials for this new\r\nsport.\r\n\r\nWind alone would not have been so bad; drift snow accompanied it in\r\noverwhelming amount. In the autumn overcast weather with heavy falls\r\nof snow prevailed, with the result that the air for several months was\r\nseldom free from drift. Indeed, during that time, there were not\r\nmany days when objects a hundred yards away could be seen distinctly.\r\nWhatever else happened, the wind never abated, and so, even when the\r\nsnow had ceased falling and the sky was clear, the drift continued until\r\nall the loose accumulations on the hinterland, for hundreds of miles\r\nback, had been swept out to sea. Day after day deluges of drift streamed\r\npast the Hut, at times so dense as to obscure objects three feet away,\r\nuntil it seemed as if the atmosphere were almost solid snow.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nA comparison of wind-velocities and temperatures prevailing at Cape\r\nRoyds, Mcmurdo Sound, and at winter quarters, Adelie Land, during the\r\nmonths of May and June\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of plotting only the above two months were available, but\r\nthey are enough to illustrate the unusually severe winter conditions of\r\nAdelie Land. The data for Cape Royds is that supplied by the Shackleton\r\nExpedition. The solid black line refers to Adelie Land, the broken line\r\nto Cape Royds. It will be noted that whereas the average temperature\r\nconditions are closely similar at both stations, only on three days\r\nduring the period did the average wind velocity at Cape Royds reach that\r\nof the lowest daily value of Adelie Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPicture drift so dense that daylight comes through dully, though,\r\nmaybe, the sun shines in a cloudless sky; the drift is hurled, screaming\r\nthrough space at a hundred miles an hour, and the temperature is below\r\nzero, Fahrenheit.** You have then the bare, rough facts concerning\r\nthe worst blizzards of Adelie Land. The actual experience of them is\r\nanother thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** Temperatures as low as -28 degrees F.\r\n(60 degrees below freezing-point) were experienced in hurricane winds,\r\nwhich blew at a velocity occasionally exceeding one hundred miles per\r\nhour. Still air and low temperatures, or high winds and moderate\r\ntemperatures, are well enough; but the combination of high winds and low\r\ntemperatures is difficult to bear.\r\n\r\nShroud the infuriated elements in the darkness of a polar night, and the\r\nblizzard is presented in a severer aspect. A plunge into the writhing\r\nstorm-whirl stamps upon the senses an indelible and awful impression\r\nseldom equalled in the whole gamut of natural experience. The world a\r\nvoid, grisly, fierce and appalling. We stumble and struggle through\r\nthe Stygian gloom; the merciless blast--an incubus of vengeance--stabs,\r\nbuffets and freezes; the stinging drift blinds and chokes. In a ruthless\r\ngrip we realize that we are\r\n\r\n                        poor windlestraws\r\n    On the great, sullen, roaring pool of Time.\r\n\r\nIt may well be imagined that none of us went out on these occasions\r\nfor the pleasure of it. The scientific work required all too frequent\r\njourneys to the instruments at a distance from the Hut, and, in\r\naddition, supplies of ice and stores had to be brought in, while the\r\ndogs needed constant attention.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, Madigan visited all the meteorological instruments and\r\nchanged the daily charts; at times having to feel his way from one place\r\nto the other. Attending to the exposed instruments in a high wind with\r\nlow temperature was bad enough, but with suffocating drift difficulties\r\nwere increased tenfold.\r\n\r\nAround the Hut there was a small fraternity who chose the outside\r\nveranda as a rendezvous. Here the latest gossip was exchanged, and the\r\nweather invariably discussed in forcible terms. There was Whetter, who\r\nreplenished the water-supply from the unfailing fountain-head of the\r\nglacier. For cooking, washing clothes and for photographic and other\r\npurposes, eighteen men consumed a good deal of water, and, to keep up\r\nwith the demand, Whetter piled up many hardly-won boxes of ice in\r\nthe veranda. Close unearthed coal briquettes from the heap outside,\r\nshovelled tons of snow from the veranda and made himself useful and\r\namiable to every one. Murphy, our stand-by in small talk, travel,\r\nhistory, literature and what not, was the versatile storeman. The store\r\nin the veranda was continually invaded by similar snow to that which\r\ncovered the provision boxes outside. To keep the veranda cleared, renew\r\nthe supplies and satisfy the demands of the kitchen required no other\r\nthan Murphy. Ninnis and Mertz completed the \"Veranda Club,\" to which\r\nhonorary members from within the Hut were constantly being added.\r\n\r\nThe meteorological instruments, carefully nursed and housed though they\r\nwere, were bound to suffer in such a climate. Correll, who was well\r\nfitted out with a lathe and all the requirements for instrument-making,\r\nattended to repairs, doing splendid service. The anemometer gave the\r\ngreatest trouble, and, before Correll had finished with it, most of the\r\nworking parts had been replaced in stronger metal.\r\n\r\nWhen the recording sheets of the instruments had been successfully\r\nchanged, the meteorologist packed them in a leather bag, strapped on his\r\nshoulders, so that they would not be lost on the way to the Hut. As soon\r\nas he arrived indoors the bag was opened and emptied; the papers being\r\npicked out from a small heap of snow.\r\n\r\nIt was a fortunate thing that no one was lost through failing to\r\ndiscover the Hut during the denser drifts. Hodgeman on one occasion\r\ncaused every one a good deal of anxiety. Among other things, he\r\nregularly assisted Madigan by relieving him of outdoor duties on the day\r\nafter his nightwatch, when the chief meteorologist was due for a \"watch\r\nbelow.\" It was in the early autumn--few of us, then, were adepts at\r\nfinding our way by instinct--that Hodgeman and Madigan set out, one\r\nmorning, for the anemometer. Leaving the door of the Hut, they lost\r\nsight of each other at once, but anticipated meeting at the instrument.\r\nMadigan reached his destination, changed the records, waited for a while\r\nand then returned, expecting to see his companion at the Hut. He did\r\nnot appear, so, after a reasonable interval, search parties set off in\r\ndifferent directions.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing at eighty miles per hour, making it tedious work\r\ngroping about and hallooing in the drift. The sea was close at hand\r\nand we realized that, as the wind was directly off shore, a man without\r\ncrampons was in a dangerous situation. Two men, therefore, roped\r\ntogether and carefully searched round the head of the boat harbour; one\r\nanchoring himself with an ice-axe, whilst the other, at the end of the\r\nrope, worked along the edge of the sea. Meanwhile Hodgeman returned to\r\nthe Hut, unaided, having spent a very unpleasant two hours struggling\r\nfrom one landmark to another, his outer garments filled with snow.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the wind came steadily from the same direction made it\r\npossible to steer, otherwise outdoor operations would not have\r\nbeen conducted so successfully. For instance, Webb, who visited the\r\nMagnetograph House, a quarter of a mile distant, at least once a day,\r\nmade his way between various \"beacons\" by preserving a definite bearing\r\non the wind. His journeys were rendered all the more difficult because\r\nthey were frequently undertaken at night.\r\n\r\nIn struggling along through very dense drifts one would be inclined to\r\nthink that the presence of the sun was a matter of small concern. As a\r\nmatter of fact there was, during the day, a good deal of reflected white\r\nlight and a dark object looms up within a yard or two. In darkness there\r\nwas nothing to recognize. So Webb would often run by dead reckoning on\r\nto the roof of the Hut, and would then feel his way round it till he\r\ncaught the glimmer of a hurricane lantern coming through the veranda\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nI had always the greatest admiration for the unfailing manner in which\r\nthose responsible for the tidal, magnetic and meteorological work\r\ncarried out their duties.\r\n\r\nAs a measure of the enormous amount of drift, we set about constructing\r\na gauge, which, it was hoped, would give us a rough estimate of the\r\nquantity passing the Hut in a year. Hannam, following the approved\r\ndesign, produced a very satisfactory contrivance. It consisted of a\r\nlarge drift-tight box, fitted on the windward side with a long metal\r\ncone, tapering to an aperture three-quarters of an inch in diameter. The\r\ndrift-laden air entered the aperture, its speed was checked on entering\r\nthe capacious body of the gauge and consequently the snow fell to the\r\nbottom of the box and the air passed out behind through a trap-door.\r\nThe catch was taken out periodically through a bolted lid, the snow was\r\nmelted, the resulting water measured and its weight calculated.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nThe drift gauge\r\n\r\n\r\nIn thick drifts, one's face inside the funnel of the burberry helmet\r\nbecame rapidly packed with snow, which, by the warmth of the skin and\r\nbreath, was changed into a mask of ice. This adhered firmly to the rim\r\nof the helmet and to the beard and face. The mask became so complete\r\nthat one had to clear away obstructions continually from the eyes. It\r\nwas not easy to remove the casing of ice, outside in the wind,\r\nbecause this could only be done slowly, with bare fingers exposed. An\r\nexperienced man, once inside the Hut, would first see that the ice\r\nwas broken along the rim of the helmet; otherwise, when it came to be\r\nhastily dragged off, the hairs of the beard would follow as well. As\r\nsoon as the helmet was off the head, the icicles hanging on the beard\r\nand glazing the eyelashes were gradually thawed by the fingers and\r\nremoved. The above treatment was learned by experience.\r\n\r\nThe abrasion-effects produced by the impact of the snow particles were\r\nastonishing. Pillars of ice were cut through in a few days, rope was\r\nfrayed, wood etched and metal polished. Some rusty dog-chains were\r\nexposed to it, and, in a few days, they had a definite sheen. A deal\r\nbox, facing the wind, lost all its painted bands and in a fortnight was\r\nhandsomely marked; the hard, knotty fibres being only slightly attacked,\r\nwhilst the softer, pithy laminae were corroded to a depth of one-eighth\r\nof an inch.\r\n\r\nThe effect of constant abrasion upon the snow's surface is to harden it,\r\nand, finally, to carve ridges known as sastrugi. Of these much will be\r\nsaid when recounting our sledging adventures, because they increase so\r\nmuch the difficulties of travelling.\r\n\r\nEven hard, blue ice may become channelled and pitted by the action of\r\ndrift. Again, both neve and ice may receive a wind-polish which makes\r\nthem very slippery.\r\n\r\nOf the effect of wind and drift upon rock, there was ample evidence\r\naround Winter Quarters. Regarded from the north, the aspect of the\r\nrocks was quite different from that on the southern side. The southern,\r\nwindward faces were on the whole smooth and rounded, but there was no\r\ndefinite polish, because the surface was partly attacked by the chipping\r\nand splitting action of frost. The leeward faces were rougher and\r\nmore disintegrated. More remarkable still were the etchings of the\r\nnon-homogeneous banded rocks. The harder portions of these were raised\r\nin relief, producing quite an artistic pattern.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the drift, a point which struck me was the enormous amount\r\nof cold communicated to the sea by billions of tons of low-temperature\r\nsnow thrown upon its surface. The effect upon the water, already at\r\nfreezing-point, would be to congeal the surface at once. Whilst the wind\r\ncontinued, however, there was no opportunity for a crust to form,\r\nthe uppermost layers being converted into a pea-soup-like film which\r\nstreamed away to the north.\r\n\r\nA description of the drifts of Adelie Land would not be complete\r\nwithout mentioning the startling electrical effects which were sometimes\r\nobserved. The first record of these was made by McLean, when on\r\nnight-watch on March 22. While taking the observations at midnight,\r\nhe noticed St. Elmo's fire, a \"brush discharge\" of electricity, on the\r\npoints of the nephoscope. As the weather became colder this curious\r\nphenomenon increased in intensity. At any time in the drift, an\r\nelectroscope exposed outside became rapidly charged. A spark gap in a\r\nvacuum, connected with a free end of wire, gave a continuous discharge.\r\nAt times, when the effects were strong, the night-watchman would find\r\nthe edges and wire stays of the screen outlined in a fashion reminiscent\r\nof a pyrotechnic display or an electric street-advertisement. The\r\ncorners of boxes and points of rock glowed with a pale blue light. The\r\nsame appeared over points on the clothing, on the mitts and round the\r\nfunnel of the helmet. No sensation was transmitted to the body from\r\nthese points of fire, at least nothing sufficiently acute to be felt,\r\nwith the drift and wind lashing on the body outside. However, the\r\nanemograph several times discharged a continuous stream of sparks into\r\nMadigan's fingers while he was changing the records. Once these sparks\r\nreached half an inch in length, and, as his fingers were bared for the\r\nwork, there was no mistaking the feeling.\r\n\r\nFor regular observations on the subject, Correll fixed a pointed\r\ncollector--a miniature lightning-conductor--above the flagpole on the\r\nsummit of the roof. A wire was led through an insulator, so that the\r\nstream of electricity could be subjected to experiment in the Hut. Here\r\na \"brush\" of blue light radiated outwards to a distance of one inch.\r\nWhen a conductor was held close to it, a rattling volley of sparks\r\nimmediately crossed the interval and the air was pervaded with a strong\r\nsmell of ozone. Of course sparks were not always being emitted by the\r\ncollector, and it was important to determine the periods of activity.\r\nTo ensure this, Hurley devised an automatic arrangement, so that an\r\nelectric bell was set ringing whenever a current was passing; the\r\nnight-watchman would then note the fact in the log-book. However, the\r\nbell responded so often and so vigorously that it was soon dismantled\r\nfor the benefit of sleepers. It was singular that the \"brush discharge\"\r\nwas sometimes most copious when the atmosphere was filled with very fine\r\ndrift, and not necessarily during dense drift.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said, it will be obvious that the drift-laden\r\nhurricanes of the country were more than ordinarily formidable. They\r\nscarcely seemed to provide a subject for poetic inspiration; still\r\nthe following effusion appeared by McLean, Editor of the 'Adelie\r\nBlizzard':--\r\n\r\n       THE BLIZZARD\r\n\r\n    A snow-hush brooding o'er the grey rock-hills!\r\n    A wold of silence, ominous, that fills\r\n    The wide seascape of ice-roofed islands, rolls\r\n    To ether-zones that gird the frigid Poles!\r\n\r\n    Realm of purest alabaster-white,\r\n    Wreathed in a vast infinitude of light;\r\n    The royal orb swings to thy summer gaze\r\n    A glitt'ring azure world of crystal days.\r\n\r\n    The lorn bird-voices of an unseen land-\r\n    No hue of forest, gleam of ocean sand-\r\n    Rise in a ceaseless plaint of raucous din,\r\n    On northern tides the bergs come floating in.\r\n\r\n    The wind-sprites murmuring in hinter-snow-\r\n    The pent heart-throbbings of the wan plateau-\r\n    Wing through the pulsing spell thrown o'er the sea,\r\n    In wild and shrieking blizzard minstrelsy.\r\n\r\n    Swirl of the drift-cloud's shimm'ring sleet;\r\n    Race of the spray-smoke's hurtling sheet\r\n    Swelling trail of the streaming, sunbright foam,\r\n    Wafting sinuous brash to an ice-field home.\r\n\r\n    Eddy-wraiths o'er the splintered schist-\r\n    Torrent spume down the glacier hissed!\r\n    Throbbing surge of the ebbing seaward gust,\r\n    Raping stillness vast in its madd'ning lust.\r\n\r\n    Lotus-floe 'neath the Barrier brink,\r\n    Starting sheer--a marble blink-\r\n    Pelting shafts from the show'ring arrow-blast\r\n    Strike--ill the blackened flood seethe riven past.\r\n\r\n    Glow of the vibrant, yellow west\r\n    Pallid fades in the dread unrest.\r\n    Low'ring shades through the fury-stricken night\r\n    Rack the screaming void in shudd'ring might.\r\n\r\n    Requiem peace from the hinter-snows\r\n    Soft as river music flows.\r\n    Dawn in a flushing glamour tints the sea;\r\n    Serene her thrill of rhythmic ecstasy.\r\n\r\nSledging was out of the question. Indeed, we recognized how fortunate we\r\nwere not to have pushed farther south in March. Had we advanced, it is\r\nmore than likely that provisions would have been exhausted before we\r\ncould have located the Hut in the sea of drift. Our hopes were now\r\ncentred on midwinter calms.\r\n\r\nLooking through my diary, I notice that on March 24, \"we experienced\r\na rise in spirits because of the improved weather.\" I find the average\r\nvelocity of the wind for that day to have been forty-five miles per\r\nhour, corresponding to a \"strong gale\" on the Beaufort scale. This tells\r\nits own story.\r\n\r\nWhen the high wind blew off shore, there was no backswell, on account of\r\nthe pack-ice to the north quelling the sea. The arrival of a true ocean\r\nswell meant that the pack had been dispersed. On March 24 such appears\r\nto have been the case, for then, during the day, a big northerly swell\r\nset in, dashing over the ice-foot and scattering seaweed on the rocks.\r\n\r\nAfter the equinox, the temperatures remained in the vicinity of zero,\r\nFahrenheit. The penguins took to the sea, and, save for the glimpse of\r\nan occasional petrel on the wing, the landscape was desolate.\r\n\r\nIt was high time that our programme of construction was completed, but,\r\nhowever much we tried, it was impossible to do a great deal in winds\r\nexceeding fifty miles an hour. By taking advantage of days freest from\r\ndrift, the exterior of the Hangar was completed by April 6. After the\r\nair-tractor sledge had been moved inside, the snow was piled so high\r\non the leeward face, that the shelter became naturally blocked with a\r\nrampart of snow which served admirably in place of the wall of tarpaulin\r\nwhich we originally intended to use.\r\n\r\nBickerton could now proceed at leisure to make any necessary\r\nalterations. The Hangar was also used as a store for many articles which\r\nhad been crowded into odd corners or rescued from the snow outside. To\r\nincrease its size, tunnels were afterwards driven into the bank of snow\r\nand timber was stowed in these so as to be safe from burial and loss.\r\n\r\nThe building was finished just in the nick of time. Snow came down so\r\nthickly that had the falls occurred a few days earlier, the cases from\r\nwhich the place was constructed would have been effectually buried and\r\nthe construction made an impossibility.\r\n\r\nBut for the wind, the Hut would have been lost to sight. Still, it was\r\ncompletely surrounded by massive drifts, and the snow was driven by the\r\nwind past the canvas flap and through the entrance, until the veranda\r\nbecame choked.\r\n\r\nClose, who was night-watchman during the early morning hours of April 7,\r\nhad the greatest difficulty in getting outside to attend to his duties.\r\nTo dig his way through the entrance, reach the instruments and to return\r\noccupied a whole hour.\r\n\r\nWe were inundated with snow; even a portion of the roof was buried.\r\nThe situation required immediate attention; so it was decided to make a\r\ntunnel connecting the entrance veranda with the store veranda. From the\r\nnorth-western end of the latter, an out-draught had established itself,\r\npreserving a vertical funnel-like opening in the snow bank, always free\r\nfor entrance or exit. This proved a fortunate accident.\r\n\r\nFurther, a second tunnel, over twenty feet in length, was driven out\r\nfrom the original entrance with a view to reaching the surface at a\r\npoint beyond the lee of the Hut. It was thought that the scouring effect\r\nof the wind, there, would keep the opening of the tunnel free of drift.\r\nBut when completed, it filled rapidly with snow and had to be sealed. It\r\nwas then used to receive slop-water. While the fever for excavation\r\nwas at its height, Whetter drove, as an off-shoot to the first, another\r\ntunnel which came to be used as a nursery for the pups.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, to leave the Hut, it was necessary to crawl through a low\r\ntrap-door in the wall of the inside or entrance veranda; the way then\r\nled to the connecting tunnel and onwards to the store veranda; finally\r\none climbed through a manhole in the snow into the elements without.\r\nFrom the store veranda there was access to the Hangar by a hinged door\r\nin the common wall, and, as an additional convenience, a trap-door was\r\nmade in the roof of the inner veranda to be used during spells of clear\r\nweather or in light drift.\r\n\r\nThe old landmarks became smothered in snow, making the Hut's position a\r\nmatter of greater uncertainty. A journey by night to the magnetic huts\r\nwas an outing with a spice of adventure.\r\n\r\nClimbing out of the veranda, one was immediately swallowed in the chaos\r\nof hurtling drift, the darkness sinister and menacing. The shrill wind\r\nfled by--\r\n\r\n                ...the noise of a drive of the Dead,\r\n    Striving before the irresistible will\r\n    Through the strange dusk of this, the Debatable land\r\n    Between their place and ours.\r\n\r\nUnseen wizard hands clutched with insane fury, hacked and harried. It\r\nwas \"the raw-ribbed Wild that abhors all life, the Wild that would crush\r\nand rend.\"\r\n\r\nCowering blindly, pushing fiercely through the turmoil, one strove to\r\nkeep a course to reach the rocks in which the huts were hidden--such and\r\nsuch a bearing on the wind--so far. When the rocks came in sight, the\r\nposition of the final destination was only deduced by recognising a few\r\nsurrounding objects.\r\n\r\nOn the return journey, the vicinity of the Hut would be heralded by\r\nsuch accidents as tripping over the \"wireless\" ground wires or kicking\r\nagainst a box or a heap of coal briquettes. These clues, properly\r\nfollowed up, would lead to the Hut itself, or at least to its shelving\r\nroof. In the very thick drifts it was even possible to stand on portions\r\nof the roof without any notion of the fact. Fossicking about, one kept\r\non the alert for the feel of woodwork. When found and proved to be too\r\nextensive to be a partially buried box, it might safely be concluded to\r\nbe some part of the roof, and only required to be skirted in order to\r\nreach the vertical entrance. The lost man often discovered this pitfall\r\nby dropping suddenly through into the veranda.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the tunnel, the roar of the tempest died away into a\r\nrumble, the trap-door opened and perhaps the strains of the gramophone\r\nwould come in a kind of flippant defiance from the interior. Passing\r\nthrough the vestibule and work-room one beheld a scene in utter variance\r\nwith the outer hell. Here were warm bunks, rest, food, light and\r\ncompanionship--for the time being, heaven! Outside, the crude and naked\r\nelements of a primitive and desolate world flowed in writhing torrents.\r\n\r\nThe night-watchman's duty of taking the meteorological observations\r\nat the screen adjacent to the Hut was a small matter compared with the\r\nforegoing. First of all, it was necessary for him to don a complete\r\noutfit of protective clothing. Dressing and undressing were tedious, and\r\nabsorbed a good deal of time. At the screen, he would spend a lively\r\nfew minutes wrestling in order to hold his ground, forcing the door back\r\nagainst the pressure of wind, endeavouring to make the light shine on\r\nthe instruments, and, finally, clearing them of snow and reading them.\r\nFor illumination a hurricane lantern wrapped in a calico wind-shield was\r\nfirst used, to be displaced later by an electrical signalling-lamp and,\r\nwhile the batteries lasted, by a light permanently fixed by Hannam in\r\nthe screen itself. To assist in finding the manhole on his return, the\r\nnight-watchman was in the habit of leaving a light burning in the outer\r\nveranda.\r\n\r\nI remember waking up early one morning to find the Hut unusually cold.\r\nOn rising, I discovered Hurley also awake, busy lighting the fire which\r\nhad died out. There was no sign of Correll, the night-watchman, and we\r\nfound that the last entry in the log-book had been made several hours\r\npreviously. Hurley dressed in full burberrys and went out to make a\r\nsearch, in which he was soon successful.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Correll, running short of coal during the early\r\nmorning hours, had gone out to procure some from the stack. While he was\r\nreturning to the entrance, the wind rolled him over a few times, causing\r\nhim to lose his bearings. It was blowing a hurricane, the temperature\r\nwas -70 F., and the drift-snow was so thick as to be wall-like in\r\nopacity. He abandoned his load of coal, and, after searching about\r\nfruitlessly for some time in the darkness, he decided to wait for dawn.\r\nHurley found him about twenty yards from the back of the Hut.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of outdoor occupations reacted in an outburst of indoor\r\nwork. The smaller room had been well fitted up as a workshop, and all\r\nkinds of schemes were in progress for adapting our sledging-gear and\r\ninstruments to the severe conditions. Correll worked long hours to keep\r\nup with the demands made upon him. Nobody was idle during the day,\r\nfor, when there was nothing else to be done, there always remained the\r\nmanufacture and alteration of garments and crampons.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the wind abated to a reasonable velocity, there was a rush to\r\nthe outside jobs. Lulls would come unexpectedly, activity inside ceased,\r\nand the Hut, as seen by a spectator, resembled an ants' nest upon which\r\na strange foot had trodden: eighteen men swarming through the manhole in\r\nrapid succession, hurrying hither and thither.\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring sea still remained free from an ice-crust. This, of\r\ncourse, did not mean that freezing was not going on continuously. On the\r\ncontrary, the chilling was no doubt accelerated, but the bulk of the\r\nice was carried off to the north as fast as it was formed. Quantities,\r\nhowever, remained as ground-ice, anchored to the kelp and stones on the\r\nbottom. Gazing down through the clear waters one saw a white, mamillated\r\nsheath covering the jungle of giant seaweed, recalling a forest after a\r\nheavy snowfall. The ice, instead of being a dead weight bearing down\r\nthe branches, tended to float, and, when accumulated in large masses,\r\nsometimes succeeded in rising to the surface, uprooting and lifting\r\ngreat lengths of seaweed with it. One branching stem, found floating in\r\nthe harbour, measured eighteen feet in length.\r\n\r\nWhenever a temporary calm intervened, a skin of ice quickly appeared\r\nover the whole surface of the water. In the early stages, this formation\r\nconsisted of loose, blade-like crystals, previously floating freely\r\nbelow the surface and rising by their own buoyancy. At the surface, if\r\nundisturbed, they soon became cemented together. For example, during a\r\ncalm interval on April 6, within the interval of an hour, an even crust,\r\none inch thick, covered the sea. But the wind returned before the ice\r\nwas sufficiently strong to resist it, and it all broke up and drifted\r\naway to the north, except a piece which remained wedged firmly between\r\nthe sides of the boat harbour.\r\n\r\nIn the calm weather, abundant \"worms\" freely swimming, jelly-fish,\r\npteropods and small fish were observed. Traps were lowered along the\r\nedge of the harbour-ice and dredgings were made in every possible\r\nsituation. The bulk of the biological collecting was effected under\r\ncircumstances in which Hunter and Laseron might well have given up work\r\nin disgust. For instance, I noted in my diary that on May 16, with an\r\noff shore wind of forty-three miles per hour, they and several others\r\nwere dredging from the edge of the slippery bay-ice. The temperature at\r\nthe time was -2 degrees F.\r\n\r\nDuring April the head of the boat harbour froze over permanently, the\r\nice reaching a thickness of eighteen inches in ten days. By that time\r\nit was strong enough to be suitable for a tide-gauge. This was one of\r\nBage's charges, destined to take him out for many months in fair and\r\nfoul weather.\r\n\r\nThere were several occasions in April when the velocity of the wind\r\nexceeded ninety miles an hour. On the evening of the 26th, the wind\r\nslackened, and for part of the 27th had almost fallen to a calm. This\r\nbrought the optimists to the fore, once again, with the theory that the\r\nworst was over. The prediction was far from being fulfilled, for, as the\r\ndays passed, the average velocity steadily rose. On May 11 the average\r\nfor the twenty-four hours was eighty miles per hour. By that time the\r\nHut had been further protected by a crescent of cases, erected behind\r\nthe first break-wind. In height this erection stood above the Hangar,\r\nand, when the snow became piled in a solid ramp on the leeward side, it\r\nwas more compact than ever. Inside the Hut extra struts were introduced,\r\nstiffening the principal rafters on the southern side. It was reassuring\r\nto know that these precautions had been taken, for, on May 15, the wind\r\nblew at an average velocity of ninety miles per hour throughout the\r\nwhole twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nHaving failed to demolish us by dogged persistence, the hurricane tried\r\nnew tactics on the evening of May 24, in the form of a terrific series\r\nof Herculean gusts. As we learned afterwards, the momentary velocity of\r\nthese doubtless approached two hundred miles per hour. At 11.30 P.M. the\r\nsituation was cheerfully discussed, though every one was tuned up to a\r\nnervous pitch as the Hut creaked and shuddered under successive blows.\r\nIt seemed very doubtful whether the roof would resist the gusts, and the\r\nfeasibility of the meat cellar as a last haven of refuge was discussed.\r\nAfter the passage of each gust, the barometer dropped, rising again\r\nimmediately afterwards. Similar pulsations of the barometer were\r\nobserved many times later in the year. The maximum sudden movement noted\r\nwas one-fifth inch. Had the interior of the Hut been more freely in\r\ncommunication with the outside air, instead of resembling a hermetically\r\nsealed box, the \"kicks\" would undoubtedly have been much greater.\r\n\r\nCyclonic gusts were repeated a few days after, when the upper tiers of\r\nboxes composing the break-wind were thrown down and pebbles from the\r\nmoraine were hurled on the roof. The average velocity of the wind for\r\neach of the three autumn months was as follows: March, 49 miles per\r\nhour; April, 51.5 miles per hour, and May 60.7 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nOn May 1 the temperatures became lower, so that it was difficult to\r\nmove about in the gales without the face getting frost-bitten. Our usual\r\nremedy when this occurred was to hold a mitt over the part affected;\r\nthus sheltered, its circulation of blood was soon re-established,\r\nunless the cold were very intense. In the extremities--the fingers and\r\ntoes--warmth was not so easily restored.\r\n\r\nReturning from attending the instruments at noon on May 22, Madigan,\r\naccording to the usual habit, before taking off his wind-proof clothes,\r\ncommenced clearing away the ice adhering to his helmet and face. One\r\nwhite patch refused to leave the side of his face, until some one\r\nobserved that it was a frost-bite, and acquainted him of the fact.\r\nFrost-bites that day were excusable enough, for the wind was blowing\r\nbetween ninety-five and hundred miles per hour, there was dense drifting\r\nsnow and a temperature of -28 degrees F.\r\n\r\nWe had found an accursed country. On the fringe of an unspanned\r\ncontinent along whose gelid coast our comrades had made their home--we\r\nknew not where--we dwelt where the chill breath of a vast, Polar\r\nwilderness, quickening to the rushing might of eternal blizzards, surged\r\nto the northern seas. Already, and for long months we were beneath\r\n\"frost-fettered Winter's frown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII DOMESTIC LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nOur hearth and home was the living Hut and its focus was the stove.\r\nKitchen and stove were indissolubly linked, and beyond their pale was\r\na wilderness of hanging clothes, boots, finnesko, mitts and what not,\r\nbounded by tiers of bunks and blankets, more hanging clothes and dim\r\nphotographs between the frost-rimed cracks of the wooden walls.\r\n\r\nOne might see as much in the first flicker of the acetylene through a\r\nmaze of hurrying figures, but as his eyes grew accustomed to the light,\r\nthe plot would thicken: books orderly and disorderly, on bracketed\r\nshelves, cameras great and small in motley confusion, guns and a\r\ngramophone-horn, serpentine yards of gas-tubing, sewing machines,\r\na microscope, rows of pint-mugs, until--thud! he has obstructed a\r\nwild-eyed messman staggering into the kitchen with a box of ice.\r\n\r\nThe wilderness was always inhabited, so much so that it often became a\r\nbear-garden in which raucous good humour prevailed over everything.\r\n\r\nNoise was a necessary evil, and it commenced at 7.30 A.M., with the\r\nsubdued melodies of the gramophone, mingled with the stirring of the\r\nporridge-pot and the clang of plates deposited none too gently on\r\nthe table. At 7.50 A.M. came the stentorian: \"Rise and shine!\" of the\r\nnight-watchman, and a curious assortment of cat-calls, beating on pots\r\nand pans and fragmentary chaff. At the background, so to speak, of all\r\nthese sounds was the swishing rush of the wind and the creaking strain\r\nof the roof, but these had become neglected. In fact, if there were a\r\ncalm, every one was restless and uneasy.\r\n\r\nThe seasoned sleeper who survived the ten minutes' bombardment before\r\n8 o'clock was an unusual person, and he was often the Astronomer Royal.\r\nBesides his dignified name he possessed a wrist-watch, and there was\r\nnever a movement in his mountain of blankets until 7.59 A.M., unless\r\nthe jocular night-watchman chose to make a heap of them on the floor.\r\nTo calls like \"Breakfast all ready! Porridge on the table getting cold!\"\r\nseventeen persons in varying stages of wakefulness responded. No one\r\nwas guilty of an elaborate toilet, water being a scarce commodity. There\r\nwere adherents of the snow-wash theory, but these belonged to an earlier\r\nand warmer epoch of our history.\r\n\r\nFor downright, tantalizing cheerfulness there was no one to equal the\r\nnight-watchman. While others strove to collect their befuddled senses,\r\nthis individual prated of \"wind eighty miles per hour with moderate\r\ndrift and brilliant St. Elmo's fire.\" He boasted of the number of\r\ngarments he had washed, expanded vigorously on bread making--his brown,\r\nappetizing specimens in full public view--told of the latest escapade\r\namong the dogs, spoke of the fitful gleams of the aurora between 1.30\r\nand 2 A.M., of his many adventures on the way to the meteorological\r\nscreen and so forth; until from being a mere night-watchman he had\r\nraised himself to the status of a public hero. For a time he was most\r\nobjectionable, but under the solid influence of porridge, tinned fruit,\r\nfresh bread, butter and tea and the soothing aroma of innumerable\r\npipes, other public heroes arose and ousted this upstart of the night.\r\nMeanwhile, the latter began to show signs of abating energy after\r\ntwelve hours' work. Soon some wag had caught him having a private nap, a\r\nwhispered signal was passed round and the unfortunate hero was startled\r\ninto life with a rousing \"Rise and shine!\" in which all past scores were\r\npaid off.\r\n\r\nEvery one was at last awake and the day began in earnest. The first hint\r\nof this came from the messman and cook who commenced to make a Herculean\r\nsweep of the pint-mugs and tin plates. The former deferentially\r\nproceeded to scrape the plates, the master-cook presiding over a tub of\r\nboiling water in which he vigorously scoured knives, forks and spoons,\r\ntransferring them in dripping handfuls to the cleanest part of the\r\nkitchen-table. Cooks of lyric inclination would enliven the company with\r\nthe score of the latest gramophone opera, and the messman and company\r\nwould often feel impelled to join in the choruses.\r\n\r\nThe night-watchman had sunk into log-like slumber, and the meteorologist\r\nand his merry men were making preparations to go abroad. The merry men\r\nincluded the ice-carrier, the magnetician, the two wardens of the\r\ndogs, the snow-shoveller and coal-carrier and the storeman. The rest\r\nsubdivided themselves between the living Hut at 45 degrees F. and the\r\nouter Hut below freezing-point, taking up their endless series of jobs.\r\n\r\nThe merry men began to make an organized raid on the kitchen. Around\r\nand above the stove hung oddments like wolf-skin mitts, finnesko, socks,\r\nstockings and helmets, which had passed from icy rigidity through sodden\r\nlimpness to a state of parchment dryness. The problem was to recover\r\none's own property and at the same time to avoid the cook scraping the\r\nporridge saucepan and the messman scrubbing the table.\r\n\r\nThe urbane storeman saved the situation by inquiring of the cook: \"What\r\nwill you have for lunch?\" Then followed a heated colloquy, the former,\r\nlike a Cingalese vendor, having previously made up his mind. The\r\nargument finally crystallized down to lambs' tongues and beetroot,\r\nthrough herrings and tomato sauce, fresh herrings, kippered herrings,\r\nsardines and corn beef.\r\n\r\nThe second question was a preliminary to more serious business; \"What\r\nwould you like for dinner?\"\r\n\r\nAlthough much trouble might have been saved by reference to the\r\nregulation programme, which was composed to provide variety in diet and\r\nto eliminate any remote chance of scurvy, most cooks adopted an attitude\r\nof surly independence, counting it no mean thing to have wheedled from\r\nthe storeman a few more ounces of \"glaxo,\" another tin of peas or an\r\nextra ration of penguin meat. All this chaffering took place in the open\r\nmarket-place, so to speak, and there was no lack of frank criticism from\r\nbystanders, onlookers and distant eavesdroppers. In case the cook was\r\nworsted, the messman sturdily upheld his opinions, and in case the\r\nweight of public opinion was too much for the storeman, he slipped on\r\nhis felt mitts, shouldered a Venesta box and made for the tunnel which\r\nled to the store.\r\n\r\nHe reaches an overhead vent admitting a cool torrent of snow, and with\r\nthe inseparable box plunges ahead into darkness. An hour later his\r\nruddy face reappears in the Hut, and a load of frosted tins is soon\r\nunceremoniously dumped on to the kitchen table. The cook in a swift\r\nsurvey notes the absence of penguin meat. \"That'll take two hours to dig\r\nout!\" is the storeman's rejoinder, and to make good his word, proceeds\r\nto pull off blouse and helmet. By careful inquiry in the outer Hut he\r\nfinds an ice-axe, crowbar and hurricane lantern. The next move is to\r\nthe outer veranda, where a few loose boards are soon removed, and the\r\nstoreman, with a lithe twist, is out of sight.\r\n\r\nWe have pushed the tools down and, following the storeman, painfully\r\nsqueezed into an Arcadia of starry mounds of snow and glistening plaques\r\nof ice, through which project a few boulders and several carcases\r\nof mutton. The storeman rummages in the snow and discloses a pile of\r\npenguins, crusted hard together in a homogeneous lump. Dislodging\r\na couple of penguins appears an easy proposition, but we are soon\r\ndisillusioned. The storeman seizes the head of one bird, wrenches hard,\r\nand off it breaks as brittle as a stalactite. The same distracting thing\r\nhappens to both legs, and the only remedy is to chip laboriously an icy\r\nchannel around it.\r\n\r\nIn a crouching or lying posture, within a confined space, this means\r\nthe expenditure of much patience, not to mention the exhaustion of all\r\ninvective. A crowbar decides the question. One part of the channel is\r\nundermined, into this the end of the crowbar is thrust and the penguin\r\nshoots up and hits the floor of the Hut.\r\n\r\nThe storeman, plastered with snow, reappears hot and triumphant\r\nbefore the cook, but this dignitary is awkwardly kneading the dough of\r\nwholemeal scones, and the messman is feeding the fire with seal-blubber\r\nto ensure a \"quick\" oven. Every one is too busy to notice the storeman,\r\nfor, like the night-watchman, his day is over and he must find another\r\njob.\r\n\r\nJobs in the Hut were the elixir of life, and a day's cooking was\r\nno exception to the rule. It began at 7 A.M., and, with a brief\r\nintermission between lunch and afternoon tea, continued strenuously\r\ntill 8.30 P.M. Cooks were broadly classified as \"Crook Cooks\" and\r\n\"Unconventional Cooks\" by the eating public. Such flattering titles\r\nas \"Assistant Grand Past Master of the Crook Cooks' Association\" or\r\n\"Associate of the Society of Muddling Messmen\" were not empty inanities;\r\nthey were founded on solid fact--on actual achievement. If there were no\r\nconstitutional affiliation, strong sympathy undoubtedly existed between\r\nthe \"Crook Cooks' Association\" and \"The Society of Muddling Messmen.\"\r\nBoth contained members who had committed \"championships.\"\r\n\r\n\"Championship\" was a term evolved from the local dialect, applying to\r\na slight mishap, careless accident or unintentional disaster in any\r\ndepartment of Hut life. The fall of a dozen plates from the shelf to the\r\nfloor, the fracture of a table-knife in frozen honey, the burning of the\r\nporridge or the explosion of a tin thawing in the oven brought down\r\non the unfortunate cook a storm of derisive applause and shouts of\r\n\"Championship! Championship!\"\r\n\r\nThawing-out tinned foods by the heroic aid of a red-hot stove was a\r\ncommon practice. One day a tin of baked beans was shattered in the\r\n\"port\" oven, and fragments of dried beans were visible on the walls\r\nand door for weeks. Our military cook would often facetiously refer to\r\n\"platoon-firing in the starboard oven.\"\r\n\r\nOne junior member of the \"Crook Cooks' Association\" had the hardihood\r\nto omit baking powder in a loaf of soda-bread, trusting that prolonged\r\nbaking would repair the omission. The result was a \"championship\" of a\r\nvery superior order. Being somewhat modest, he committed it through the\r\ntrap-door to the mercy of the wind, and for a time it was lost in the\r\nstraggling rubbish which tailed away to the north. Even the prowling\r\ndogs in their wolfish hunger could not overcome a certain prejudice.\r\nOf course some one found it, and the public hailed it with delight. A\r\nsearching inquiry was made, but the perpetrator was never discovered.\r\nThat loaf, however, like the proverbial bad penny, turned up for months.\r\nWhen the intricate system of snow-tunnels was being perfected, it was\r\nexcavated. In the early summer, when the aeroplane was dug out of the\r\nHangar, that loaf appeared once more, and almost the last thing we saw\r\nwhen leaving the Hut, nearly two years after, was this petrifaction on\r\nan icy pedestal near the Boat Harbour.\r\n\r\nNo one ever forgot the roly-poly pudding made without suet; synthetic\r\nrubber was its scientific name. And the muddling messman could never be\r\nsurpassed who lost the cutter of the sausage machine and put salt-water\r\nice in the melting-pots.\r\n\r\nThere appeared in the columns of 'The Adelie Blizzard' an article by the\r\nmeteorologist descriptive of an occasion when two members of the \"Crook\r\nCooks' Association\" officiated in the kitchen:\r\n\r\nTEREBUS AND ERROR IN ERUPTION An 'Orrible Affair in One Act BY A\r\nSURVIVOR\r\n\r\nDramatis Personae\r\n\r\nTEREBUS |         |   Crook Cooks\r\nERROR |\r\n\r\nOther Expedition Members\r\n\r\nScene: Kitchen, Winter Quarters.\r\n\r\nTime: 5.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nERROR.

I believe it is considered that a square tin is more suitable\r\nfor ordinary ovens, but, on the other hand, Nansen in his 'Farthest\r\nNorth' used flat dishes.\r\n\r\nTEREBUS. Use a tin.

It's only an ordinary share.\r\n\r\n[TEREBUS is too busy to reply, and further eruption is prevented by the\r\ntemporary plugging of ERROR.\r\n\r\nCooking, under the inspiration of Mrs. Beeton, became a fine art:\r\n\r\n    On bones we leave no meat on,\r\n    For we study Mrs. Beeton.\r\n\r\nSo said the song. On birthdays and other auspicious occasions dishes\r\nappeared which would tempt a gourmet. Puff-pastry, steam-puddings,\r\njellies and blancmanges, original potages and consommes, seal curried\r\nand spiced, penguin delicately fried, vegetables reflavoured, trimmed\r\nand adorned were received without comment as the culinary standard rose.\r\n\r\nBirthdays were always greeted with special enthusiasm. Speeches were\r\nmade, toasts were drunk, the supple boards of the table creaked\r\nwith good things, cook and messman vied with each other in lavish\r\nhospitality, the Hut was ornate with flags, every man was spruce in\r\nhis snowiest cardigan and neck-cloth, the gramophone sang of music-hall\r\ndays, the wind roared its appreciation through the stove-pipe, and\r\nrollicking merriment was supreme. On such occasions the photographer and\r\nthe biologist made a genial combination.\r\n\r\nThe dark-room was the nursery of the topical song. There, by lantern\r\nor candle-stump, wit Rabelaisian, Aristophanic or Antarctic was cradled\r\ninto rhyme. From there, behind the scenes, the comedian in full dress\r\ncould step before the footlights into salvoes of savage applause. \"A\r\nPair of Unconventional Cooks are we, are we,\" and the famous refrain,\r\n\"There he is, that's him,\" were long unrivalled in our musical annals.\r\n\r\nCelebrations were carried on into the night, but no one forgot the\r\ncook and the messman. The table was cleared by many willing hands, some\r\nbrought in ice and coal or swept the floor, others scraped plates or\r\nrinsed out mugs and bowls. Soon, everything had passed through the\r\ncauldron of water, soap and soda to the drying-towels and on to the\r\nshelves. The main crowd then repaired with pipes and cigars to \"Hyde\r\nPark Corner,\" where the storeman, our raconteur par excellence,\r\nentertained the smokers' club. A mixed concert brought the evening to\r\nthe grand finale--\"Auld Lang Syne.\"\r\n\r\nAfter events of this character, the higher shelves of the kitchen, in\r\nthe interstices between thermographs, photographic plates ink bottles,\r\nand Russian stout, abounded with titbits of pie crust, blancmange,\r\njelly, Vienna rusks, preserved figs, and other \"perks.\" Such \"perks,\" or\r\nperquisites, were the property of the presiding cook or night-watchman\r\nand rarely survived for more than a day.\r\n\r\nThe mania for celebration became so great that reference was frequently\r\nmade to the almanac. During one featureless interval, the anniversary\r\nof the First Lighting of London by Gas was observed with extraordinary\r\neclat.\r\n\r\nThe great medium of monetary exchange in the Hut was chocolate. A ration\r\nof thirty squares was distributed by the storeman every Saturday night,\r\nand for purposes of betting, games of chance, \"Calcutta sweeps\" on the\r\nmonthly wind-velocity and general barter, chocolate held the premier\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAt the \"sweeps,\" the meteorologist stood with a wooden hammer behind the\r\ntable, and the gaming public swarmed on the other side. Numbers ranging\r\nfrom \"low field\" and forty-five to sixty-five and \"high field\" were\r\nsold by auction to the highest bidder. Excitement was intense while the\r\ncartographer in clerical glasses worked out the unknown number.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of wild speculation, there were several cases of\r\nbankruptcy, which was redeemed in the ordinary way by a sale of the\r\ndebtor's effects.\r\n\r\nTwo financiers, indifferent to the charms of chocolate, established a\r\ncorner or \"Bank\" in the commodity. \"The Bank,\" by barter and usurious\r\nmethods, amassed a great heap of well-thumbed squares, and, when\r\naccused of rapacity, invented a scheme for the common good known as\r\n\"Huntoylette.\" This was a game of chance similar to roulette, and for\r\na while it completely gulfed the trusting public. In the reaction which\r\nfollowed, there was a rush on \"The Bank,\" and the concern was wound up,\r\nbut the promoters escaped with a large profit in candles and chocolate.\r\n\r\nThroughout the winter months, work went on steadily even after dinner,\r\nand hours of leisure were easy to fill. Some wrote up their diaries,\r\nplayed games, or smoked and yarned; others read, developed photos, or\r\nimitated the weary cook and went to bed. The MacKellar Library, so\r\ncalled after the donor, was a boon to all, and the literature of polar\r\nexploration was keenly followed and discussed. Taste in literature\r\nvaried, but among a throng of eighteen, the majority of whom were given\r\nto expressing their opinions in no uncertain terms--there were no rigid\r\nconventions in Adelie Land--every book had a value in accordance with a\r\ncommon standard.\r\n\r\nThere was not a dissenting voice to the charm of 'Lady Betty across the\r\nWater', and the reason for this was a special one. The sudden breath of\r\na world of warmth and colour, richness and vivacity and astute, American\r\nfreshness amid the somewhat grim attractions of an Antarctic winter was\r\ntoo much for every one. Lady Betty, in the realm of bright images, had\r\na host of devoted admirers. Her influence spread beyond the Hut to the\r\nplateau itself. Three men went sledging, and to shelter themselves from\r\nthe rude wind fashioned an ice-cavern, which, on account of its magical\r\nhues and rare lustre, could be none other than \"Aladdin's Cave.\" Lady\r\nBetty found her hero in a fairy grotto of the same name.\r\n\r\n'Lorna Doone', on the other hand, was liked by many. Still there were\r\nthose who thought that John Ridd was a fool, a slow, obtuse rustic, and\r\nso on, while Lorna was too divine and angelic for this life.\r\n\r\n'The War of the Carolinas' took the Hut by storm, but it was a\r\n\"nine days' wonder\" and left no permanent impression on the thinking\r\ncommunity. Mostly, the story was voted delightfully funny, but very\r\nfoolish and farcical after all. A few exclusive critics predicted for it\r\na future.\r\n\r\nThen there was 'The Trail of '98'. For power and blunt realism there was\r\nnothing like it, but the character of the hero was torn in the shreds of\r\ndebate. There was general agreement on two points: that the portrayal\r\nof the desolate Alaskan wild had a touch of \"home,\" and that the heroine\r\nwas a \"true sport.\"\r\n\r\nAll those who had ever hauled on the main braces, sung the\r\ntopsail-halliard chanty, learned the intricate Matty Walker, the\r\nbowline-and-a-bite and a crowd of kindred knots, had a warm spot for any\r\nyarn by Jacobs. Night after night, the storeman held the audience with\r\nthe humorous escapades of 'Ginger Dick', 'Sam' and 'Peter Russet'.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, there was a more serious, if divided interest in 'Virginibus\r\nPuerisque', 'Marcus Aurelius', 'The Unveiling of Lhassa'--but the list\r\nis rather interminable.\r\n\r\nThe whole world is asleep except the night-watchman, and he, having made\r\nthe bread, washed a tubful of clothes, kept the fire going, observed\r\nand made notes on the aurora every fifteen minutes and the weather every\r\nhalf-hour, and, finally, having had a bath, indulges in buttered toast\r\nand a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nThe Hut is dark, and a shaded burner hangs by a canvas chair in the\r\nkitchen. The wind is booming in gusts, the dogs howl occasionally in the\r\nveranda, but the night-watchman and his pipe are at peace with all men.\r\nHe has discarded a heavy folio for a light romance, while the hours\r\nscud by, broken only by the observations. The romance is closed, and he\r\nsteals to his bunk with a hurricane lamp and finds a bundle of letters.\r\nHe knows them well, but he reads them--again!\r\n\r\nPearly light rises in the north-east through the lessening drift, and\r\nanother day has come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX MIDWINTER AND ITS WORK;\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the fateful Ides of March, winter ii had practically\r\nset in, and work outside had a chequered career. When a few calm hours\r\nintervened between two blizzards a general rush was made to continue\r\nsome long-standing job. Often all that could be done was to clear the\r\nfield for action, that is, dig away large accumulations of snow. Then\r\nthe furies would break loose again, and once more we would play the\r\nwaiting game, meanwhile concerning ourselves with more sedentary\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nThere was a familiar cry when, for some meteorological reason, the wind\r\nwould relapse into fierce gusts and then suddenly stop, to be succeeded\r\nby intense stillness. \"Dead calm, up with the wireless masts!\" Every one\r\nhastily dashed for his burberrys, and soon a crowd of muffled figures\r\nwould emerge through the veranda exit, dragging ropes, blocks, picks,\r\nand shovels. There was no time to be lost.\r\n\r\nSo the erection of the wireless masts began in earnest on April 4,\r\ncontinued feverishly till the end of the month, suffered a long period\r\nof partial cessation during May and June, was revived in July and\r\nAugust, and, by September 1, two masts, each consisting of a lower-mast\r\nand top-mast, had been raised and stayed, while between them stretched\r\nthe aerial. For four weeks messages were sent out, and many of them were\r\ncaught by Macquarie Island. Nothing was heard in Adelie Land, although,\r\nbetween certain hours, regular watches were kept at the receiver. The\r\naerial was about sixty-five feet from the ground, and it was resolved\r\nto increase its height by erecting the top-gallant masts; but before\r\nanything considerable could be done, a terrific gust of wind on October\r\n13 broke three wire-stays, and down came the mast, broken and splintered\r\nby the fall. That is a brief resume of the fortunes of the \"wireless\"\r\nduring the first year.\r\n\r\nDuring February and March there were various other operations of more\r\nimmediate importance which prevented concentration of our workers on the\r\nerection of the masts. There were many odd jobs to finish about the\r\nHut, the Magnetograph House and Absolute Hut were \"under way,\" the\r\nair-tractor sledge had to be efficiently housed, and all these and\r\nmany other things could be done in weather during which it was out of\r\nquestion to hoist a mast into position. At first we were fastidious and\r\nwaited for a calm, but later, as we grew more impatient, a top-mast was\r\nactually hauled up in a wind of thirty miles per hour, with gusts of\r\nhigher velocity. Such work would sometimes be interrupted by a more\r\nfurious outbreak, when all ropes would be secured and everything made as\r\nship-shape as possible.\r\n\r\nOn March 15 the following note was made: \"The wind was on the cool side\r\njust after breakfast. A few loads of wireless equipment were sledged up\r\nto the rocks at the back of the Hut, and by the time several masts were\r\ncarried to the same place we began to warm to the work. One of Hannam's\r\ncoils of frozen rope (one hundred and twenty fathoms) had become kinked\r\nand tangled, so we dragged it up the ice-slope, straightened it out and\r\ncoiled it up again. Several 'dead men' to hold the stays were sunk into\r\nice-holes, and, during the afternoon, one mast was dragged into position\r\nby a willing crowd. Rocks were sledged to and packed around the 'dead\r\nmen' in the holes to make them compact. Towards sundown snow clouds\r\nfilled the northern sky and a blizzard sprang up which is now doing\r\nsixty miles per hour. We philosophically expect another week cooped up\r\nin the Hut.\"\r\n\r\nIt took a long time to establish the twenty good anchorages necessary\r\nfor the masts. Within a radius of eighty yards from the centre,\r\nice-holes were dug, cairns of heavy boulders were built and rocky\r\nprominences dynamited off to secure an efficient holding for the stout\r\n\"strops\" of rope. April 24 was a typical day: \"We spent the morning\r\nfixing up 'strops' for the wireless masts. The wind was blowing strongly\r\nin fifty- to sixty-mile gusts with drift, but most of the fellows 'stuck\r\nat it' all day. It was cold work on the hands and feet. Handling picks\r\nand shovels predisposes to frost-bite. Several charges of dynamite were\r\nfired in one hole wherein a mast will be stepped.\"\r\n\r\nEach mast, of oregon timber, was in four sections. The lowest section\r\nwas ten inches square and tapered upwards to the small royal mast at a\r\nprospective height of one hundred and twenty feet. At an early stage it\r\nwas realized that we could not expect to erect more than three sections.\r\nRound the steel caps at each doubling a good deal of fitting had to\r\nbe done, and Bickerton, in such occupation, spent many hours aloft\r\nthroughout the year. Fumbling with bulky mitts, handling hammers\r\nand spanners, and manipulating nuts and bolts with bare hands, while\r\nsuspended in a boatswain's chair in the wind, the man up the mast had\r\na difficult and miserable task. Bickerton was the hero of all such\r\nendeavours. Hannam directed the other workers who steadied the stays,\r\ncleared or made fast the ropes, pulled and stood by the hauling tackle\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nOne day the man on the top-mast dislodged a heavy engineering hammer\r\nwhich he thought secure. No warning was given, as he did not notice\r\nthat it had fallen. It whizzed down and buried itself in the snow, just\r\ngrazing the heads of Close and Hodgeman.\r\n\r\nThe ropes securing the aerial and running through various blocks were\r\nin constant danger of chafing during the frequent hurricanes, from their\r\nproximity to the mast and stays, or from friction on the sharp edges of\r\nthe blocks. Unknown to us, this had happened to a strong, new manilla\r\nrope by which Murphy was being hauled to the top of the lower-mast. It\r\ngave way, and, but for another rope close by, which he seized to break\r\nhis fall, an accident might have ensued.\r\n\r\nFrost-bites were common. There were so many occasions when one had to\r\nstand for a long time gripping a rope, pulling or maintaining a steady\r\nstrain, that fingers would promptly become numb and feet unbearably\r\ncold. The usual restorative was to stamp about and beat the chest with\r\nthe hands--an old sailor's trick. Attempting to climb to a block on the\r\ntop-gallant mast one day, McLean had all his fingers frost-bitten at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nIn May the weather was atrocious, and in June building the Astronomical\r\nHut and digging ice-shafts on the glacier absorbed a good many hands.\r\nIn July, despite the enthusiasm and preparation for sledging, much was\r\ndone. On August 10 the long looked-for top-mast of the southern mast\r\nbecame a reality:\r\n\r\n\"We were early astir--about 7 A.M.--while the pink coloration of dawn\r\nwas stealing over the peaceful Barrier. For once, after months, it was\r\nperfectly still. We hurried about making preparations--hauled Bickerton\r\nup to the cross-trees and awaited the moment when we should raise the\r\ntop-mast. We pulled it up half-way and Bickerton affixed a pin in its\r\ncentre, above which two stays were to be attached. Suddenly, down came\r\nthe wind in terrific gusts and, after securing the stays, the job had to\r\nbe given up.... We were just about to have lunch when the wind ceased as\r\nsuddenly as it had begun. We all sallied out once more, and, this time,\r\ncompleted the job, though for a while the top-mast was in imminent peril\r\nof being blown away by a sharp northerly gust.\"\r\n\r\nNext day the aerial was hoisted in a wind of sixty miles per hour, but\r\nthe strain was so severe on the block, upwind, that it carried away.\r\nFortunately the insulators of the aerial were entangled by the stays in\r\ntheir fall to ground, otherwise some one may have been hurt, as there\r\nwere a dozen men almost directly below.\r\n\r\nSix days after this accident, August 17, the top-mast halliard of the\r\ndown-wind mast frayed through, and as a stronger block was to be\r\naffixed for the aerial, some one had to climb up to wire it in\r\nposition. Bickerton improvized a pair of climbing irons, and, after some\r\npreliminary practice, ascended in fine style.\r\n\r\nFinally, by September 30, the aerial was at such a height as to give\r\nhope that long-distance messages might be despatched. There was a\r\ncertain amount of suppressed excitement on the evening of that day when\r\nthe engine started and gradually got up speed in the dynamo. The sharp\r\nnote of the spark rose in accompanying crescendo and, when it had\r\nreached its highest pitch, Hannam struck off a message to the world at\r\nlarge. No response came after several nights of signalling, and, since\r\nsledging had usurped every other interest, the novelty soon wore off.\r\n\r\n\"Atmospherics\"--discharges of atmospheric electricity--and discharges\r\nfrom the drift-snow were heard in the wireless receiver.\r\n\r\nWhile messages were being sent, induction effects were noted in metallic\r\nobjects around the Hut. A cook at the stove was the first to discover\r\nthis phenomenon, and then every one conceived a mania for \"drawing\"\r\nsparks. A rather stimulating experience--the more so as it usually\r\nhappened unexpectedly and accidentally--was to brush one's head against\r\none of the numerous coils of flexible metal gas-piping festooned about\r\nthe place. Sparks immediately jumped the interval with startling effect.\r\n\r\nOctober 13, the day when the mast blew down, was known in wireless\r\ncircles as Black Sunday. All had worked keenly to make the \"wireless\" a\r\nsuccess, and the final event was considered to be a public misfortune.\r\nHowever, the honours were to be retrieved during the following year.\r\n\r\nIt fell to the lot of most of the Staff that they developed an interest\r\nin terrestrial magnetism. For one thing every man had carried boulders\r\nto the great stockade surrounding the Magnetograph House. Then, too,\r\nrecorders were regularly needed to assist the magnetician in the\r\nabsolute Hut. There, if the temperature were not too low and the\r\nobservations not too lengthy, the recorder stepped out into the blizzard\r\nwith the conviction that he had learned something of value, and, when\r\nhe sat down to dinner that night, it was with a genial sense of his own\r\naltruism. In his diary he would write it all up for his own edification.\r\n\r\nIt would be on this wise: The Earth's magnetic force, which is\r\nthe active agent in maintaining the compass-needle in the magnetic\r\nmeridian** at any particular spot, acts, not as is popularly supposed,\r\nin a horizontal plane, but at a certain angle of inclination with the\r\nEarth's surface. The nearer the magnetic poles the more nearly vertical\r\ndoes the freely suspended needle become. At the South Magnetic Pole it\r\nassumes a vertical position with the south end downwards; at the North\r\nMagnetic Pole it stands on its other end. At the intermediate positions\r\nnear the equator the whole force is exerted, swinging the needle in the\r\nhorizontal plane, and in such regions ordinary ships' compasses\r\npivoted to move freely only in a horizontal plane give the greatest\r\nsatisfaction. On approaching the magnetic poles, compasses become\r\nsluggish, for the horizontal deflecting force falls off rapidly. The\r\nforce, acting in a vertical direction, tending to make the needle dip,\r\ncorrespondingly increases, but is of no value for navigation purposes.\r\nHowever, in the scientific discussion of terrestrial magnetism, both the\r\nhorizontal and vertical components as well as the absolute value of the\r\ntotal force are important, and the determination of these \"elements\"\r\nis the work of the magnetician. Affecting the average values of the\r\n\"magnetic elements\" at any one spot on the Earth's surface are regular\r\ndiurnal oscillations, apparent only by the application of very delicate\r\nmethods of observation: also there are sudden large irregular movements\r\nreferred to as magnetic storms; the latter are always specially\r\nnoticeable when unusually bright auroral phenomena are in progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** The magnetic meridian is the straight line joining the North\r\nand South Magnetic Poles and passing through the spot in question.\r\n\r\nThe observations made in the \"Absolute Hut\", carried out at frequent\r\nintervals and on each occasion occupying two men for several hours\r\ntogether, are necessary to obtain standard values as a check upon the\r\ngraphic record of the self-recording instruments which run day and night\r\nin the \"Magnetograph House\".\r\n\r\nBut this is another story. Three hours, sitting writing figures in a\r\ntemperature of -15 degrees F., is no joke. The magnetician is not so\r\nbadly off, because he is moving about, though he often has to stop and\r\nwarm his fingers, handling the cold metal.\r\n\r\nThe Magnetograph House had by far the most formidable name. The Hut,\r\nthough it symbolized our all in all, sounded very insignificant unless\r\nit were repeated with just the right intonation. The Absolute Hut had\r\na superadded dignity. The Hangar, in passing, scarcely seemed to have a\r\nright to a capital H. The Transit House, on the and other hand, was the\r\nonly dangerous rival to the first mentioned. But what's in a name?\r\n\r\nIf the Magnetograph House had been advertised, it would have been\r\ndescribed as \"two minutes from the Hut.\" This can easily be understood,\r\nfor the magnetician after leaving home is speedily blown over a few\r\nhillocks and sastrugi, and, coming to an ice-flat about one hundred and\r\nfifty yards wide, swiftly slides over it, alighting at the snow-packed\r\ndoor of his house. The outside porch is just roomy enough for a man to\r\nslip off burberrys and crampons. The latter are full of steel spikes,\r\nand being capable of upsetting magnetic equilibrium, are left outside.\r\nWalking in soft finnesko, the magnetician opens an inner door, to be at\r\nonce accosted by darkness, made more intense after the white glare of\r\nthe snow. His eyes grow accustomed to the blackness, and he gropes his\r\nway to a large box almost concealing the feeble glimmer of a lamp. The\r\nlamp is the source of the light, projected on to small mirrors attached\r\nto the magnetic needles of three variometers. A ray of light is\r\nreflected from the mirrors for several feet on to a slit, past which\r\nrevolves sensitized photographic paper folded on a drum moving by\r\nclockwork. The slightest movements of the suspended needles are greatly\r\nmagnified, and, when the paper is removed and developed in a dark-room,\r\na series of intricate curves denoting declination, horizontal intensity\r\nand vertical force, are exquisitely traced. Every day the magnetician\r\nattends to the lamp and changes papers; also at prearranged times he\r\ntests his \"scale values\" or takes a \"quick run.\"\r\n\r\nTo obtain results as free as possible from the local attraction of\r\nthe rocks in the neighbourhood, Webb resolved to take several sets of\r\nobservations on the ice-sheet. In order to make the determinations it\r\nwas necessary to excavate a cave in the glacier. This was done about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile south of the Hut in working shifts of two men.\r\nA fine cavern was hewn out, and there full sets of magnetic observations\r\nwere taken under ideal conditions.\r\n\r\nOn sledging journeys the \"dip\" and declination were both ascertained at\r\nmany stations, around and up to within less than half a degree of the\r\nSouth Magnetic Pole.\r\n\r\nWhile the wind rushed by at a maddening pace and stars flashed like\r\njewels in a black sky, a glow of pale yellow light overspread the\r\nnorth-east horizon--the aurora. A rim of dark, stratus cloud was often\r\nvisible below the light which brightened and diffused till it curved as\r\na low arc across the sky. It was eerie to watch the contour of the arc\r\nbreak, die away into a delicate pallor and reillumine in a travelling\r\nriband. Soon a long ray, as from a searchlight, flashed above one end,\r\nand then a row of vertical streamers ran out from the arc, probing\r\nupwards into the outer darkness. The streamers waxed and waned, died\r\naway to be replaced and then faded into the starlight. The arc lost its\r\nradiance, divided in patchy fragments, and all was dark once more.\r\n\r\nThis would be repeated again in a few hours and irregularly throughout\r\nthe night, but with scenic changes behind the great sombre pall of the\r\nsky. North-west, northeast, and south-east it would elusively appear in\r\nnebulous blotches, flitting about to end finally in long bright strands\r\nin the zenith, crossing the path of the \"milky way.\"\r\n\r\nBy the observer, who wrote down his exact observations in the\r\nmeteorological log, this was called a \"quiet night.\"\r\n\r\nAt times the light was nimble, flinging itself about in rich waves,\r\nwarming to dazzling yellow-green and rose. These were the nights when\r\n\"curtains\" hung festooned in the heavens, alive, rippling, dancing\r\nto the lilt of lightning music. Up from the horizon they would mount,\r\nforming a vortex overhead, soundless within the silence of the ether.\r\n\r\nA \"brilliant display,\" we would say, and the observer would be kept busy\r\nfollowing the track of the evanescent rays.\r\n\r\nPowerless, one was in the spell of an all-enfolding wonder. The vast,\r\nsolitary snow-land, cold-white under the sparkling star-gems; lustrous\r\nin the radiance of the southern lights; furrowed beneath the icy sweep of\r\nthe wind. We had come to probe its mystery, we had hoped to reduce it\r\nto terms of science, but there was always the \"indefinable\" which held\r\naloof, yet riveted our souls.\r\n\r\nThe aurora was always with us, and almost without exception could be\r\nseen on a dark, driftless night. The nature of the aurora polaris has\r\nnot yet been finally demonstrated, though it is generally agreed to be\r\na discharge of electricity occurring in the upper, more rarefied\r\natmosphere. The luminous phenomena are very similar to those seen when a\r\ncurrent of electricity is passed through a vacuum tube.\r\n\r\nOne receives a distinct impression of nearness, watching the shimmering\r\nedges of the \"curtains\" in the zenith, but all measurements indicate that\r\nthey never descend nearer than a few miles above the land-surface.\r\n\r\nCareful records were taken to establish a relation between magnetic\r\nstorms and aurorae, and a good deal of evidence was amassed to support\r\nthe fact that auroral exhibitions correspond with periods of great\r\nmagnetic disturbance. The displays in Adelie Land were found to be more\r\nactive than those which occur in higher latitudes in the Ross Sea.\r\n\r\nAn occupation which helped to introduce variety in our life was the\r\ndigging of ice-shafts. For the purpose of making observations upon its\r\nstructure and temperature various excavations were made in the sea-ice,\r\nin the ice of the glacier, and in that of the freshwater lakes. The work\r\nwas always popular. Even a whole day's labour with a pick and shovel at\r\nthe bottom of an ice-hole never seemed laborious. It was all so novel.\r\n\r\nA calm morning in June, the sky is clear and the north ablaze with the\r\ncolours of sunrise--or is it sunset? The air is delicious, and a cool\r\nwaft comes down the glacier. A deep ultramarine, shading up into a soft\r\npurple hue, blends in a colour-scheme with the lilac plateau. Two men\r\ncrunch along in spiked boots over snow mounds and polished sastrugi to\r\nthe harbour-ice. The sea to the north is glazed with freezing spicules,\r\nand over it sweep the petrels--our only living companions of the winter.\r\nIt is all an inspiration; while hewing out chunks of ice and shovelling\r\nthem away is the acute pleasure of movement, exercise.\r\n\r\nThe men measure out an area six feet by three feet, and take a\r\npreliminary temperature of the surface-ice by inserting a thermometer\r\nin a drilled hole. Then the ice begins to fly, and it is not long before\r\nthey are down one foot. Nevertheless it would surprise those acquainted\r\nonly with fresh water ice to find how tough, sticky and intractable is\r\nsea-ice. It is always well to work on a definite plan, channelling in\r\nvarious directions, and then removing the intervening lumps by a few\r\nrough sweeps of the pick. At a depth of one foot, another temperature is\r\ntaken, and some large samples of the ice laid by for the examination of\r\ntheir crystalline structure. This is repeated at two feet, and so on,\r\nuntil the whole thickness is pierced to the sea-water beneath. At three\r\nfeet brine may begin to trickle into the hole, and this increases in\r\namount until the worker is in a puddle. The leakage takes place, if not\r\nalong cracks, through capillary channels, which are everywhere present\r\nin sea-ice.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the temperature gradually rise during the\r\ndescent. At the surface the ice is chilled to the air-temperature, say\r\n-10 degrees F., and it rises in a steep gradient to approximately 28\r\ndegrees F.; close to the freezing-point of sea water. The sea-ice in\r\nthe boat-harbour varied in thickness during the winter between five and\r\nseven feet.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with sea-ice, the ice of a glacier is a marvel of prismatic\r\ncolour and glassy brilliance. This is more noticeable near the surface\r\nwhen the sun is shining. Deep down in a shaft, or in an ice-cavern, the\r\nsapphire reflection gives to the human face quite a ghastly pallor.\r\n\r\nDuring the high winds it was always easy to dispose of the fragments\r\nof ice in the earlier stages of sinking a shaft. To be rid of them, all\r\nthat was necessary was to throw a shovelful vertically upwards towards\r\nthe lee-side of the hole, the wind then did the rest. Away the chips\r\nwould scatter, tinkling over the surface of the glacier. Of course, when\r\ntwo men were at work, each took it in turns to go below, and the one\r\nabove, to keep warm, would impatiently pace up and down. Nevertheless,\r\nso cold would he become at times that a heated colloquy would arise\r\nbetween them on the subject of working overtime. When the shaft had\r\nattained depth, both were kept busy. The man at the pit's mouth lowered\r\na bucket on a rope to receive the ice and, in hauling it up, handicapped\r\nwith clumsy mitts, he had to be careful not to drop it on his\r\ncompanion's head.\r\n\r\nThe structural composition of ice is a study in itself. To the cursory\r\nglance a piece of glacier-ice appears homogeneous, but when dissected\r\nin detail it is found to be formed of many crystalline, interlocking\r\ngrains, ranging in size from a fraction of an inch to several inches\r\nin diameter. A grain-size of a half to one inch is perhaps commonest in\r\nAntarctic glacier-ice.\r\n\r\nThe history of Antarctic glacier-ice commences with the showers of snow\r\nthat fall upon the plateau. The snow particles may be blown for\r\nhundreds of miles before they finally come to rest and consolidate.\r\nThe consolidated snow is called neve, the grains of which are\r\none-twenty-fifth to one hundredth of an inch in diameter, and, en masse,\r\npresent a dazzling white appearance on account of the air spaces which\r\noccupy one-third to one-half of the whole. In time, under the influence\r\nof a heavy load of accumulated layers of neve, the grains run\r\ntogether and the air spaces are eliminated. The final result is clear,\r\ntransparent ice, of a more or less sapphire-blue colour when seen in\r\nlarge blocks. It contains only occasional air-bubbles, and the size of\r\nthe grains is much increased.\r\n\r\nLake-ice, freezing from the surface downwards, is built up of long\r\nparallel prisms, like the cells of a honey-comb on a large scale. In a\r\nlakelet near the Hut this was beautifully demonstrated. In some places\r\ncracks and fissures filled with snow-dust traversed the body of the\r\nice, and in other places long strings of beaded air-bubbles had become\r\nentangled in the process of freezing. To lie down on the clear surface\r\nand gaze \"through the looking-glass\" to the rocky bottom, twenty feet\r\nbelow, was a glimpse into \"Wonderland.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of sea-ice, the simple prismatic structure is complicated\r\nowing to the presence of saline matter dissolved in the sea water.\r\nThe saline tracts between the prisms produce a milky or opalescent\r\nappearance. The prisms are of fresh water ice, for in freezing the brine\r\nis rejected and forced to occupy the interstices of the prisms. Water of\r\ngood drinking quality can be obtained by allowing sea water ice to thaw\r\npartially. The brine, of lower freezing-point, flows away, leaving only\r\nfresh water ice behind. In this way blocks of sea-ice exposed to the\r\nsun's rays are relieved of their salty constituents, and crumble into\r\npellucid gravel when disturbed.\r\n\r\nA popular subject commanding general interest, apart from the devoted\r\nattention of specialists, was zoological collecting. Seals and birds\r\nwere made the prey of every one, and dredging through the sea-ice in\r\nwinter and spring was always a possible diversion.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid sight to watch the birds sailing in the high winds of\r\nAdelie Land. In winds of fifty to seventy miles per hour, when with good\r\ncrampons one had to stagger warily along the ice-foot, the snow petrels\r\nand Antarctic petrels were in their element. Wheeling, swinging,\r\nsinking, planing and soaring, they were radiant with life--the wild\r\nspirits of the tempest. Even in moderate drift, when through swirling\r\nsnow the vistas of sea whitened under the flail of the wind, one\r\nsuddenly caught the silver flash of wings and a snow petrel glided past.\r\n\r\nBut most memorable of all were certain winter mornings of unexpected\r\ncalm, when ruddy clouds tessellated the northern sky and were mirrored\r\nin the freezing sea. Then the petrels would be en fete, flying over from\r\nthe east following the line of the Barrier, winding round the icy\r\ncoves, darting across the jutting points and ever onward in their\r\nlong migration. In the summer they flew for weeks from the west--a\r\nnever-ending string of snow, silver-grey and Antarctic petrels, and\r\nCape pigeons. The silver-grey petrels and Cape pigeons were only abroad\r\nduring that season and were accompanied by skua gulls, giant petrels,\r\nWilson petrels, and penguins. The penguins remained in Adelie Land for\r\nthe longest period--almost six months, the skua gulls and giant petrels\r\nfor five months, and the rest for a shorter period--the tolerable season\r\nof midsummer.\r\n\r\nBirds that haunt the wide oceans all make use of the soaring principle\r\nin flight, some much more than others. The beautiful sliding sweep of\r\nthe albatross is the most familiar example. With wings outspread, it is\r\na miniature aeroplane requiring no engines, for the wind itself supplies\r\nthe power. A slight movement of the tail-feathers and wing-tips controls\r\nits balance with nice precision. Birds employing this method of flight\r\nfind their home in the zone of continuous steady winds which blow across\r\nthe broad wastes of the southern seas.\r\n\r\nMany petrels on the wing were shot during the winter. Laseron, who\r\nprepared the skins of our Adelie Land collection, determined, in the\r\ncase of a number of specimens, the ratio of weight to horizontal area\r\nexposed to the wind. This subject is one which has lately exercised the\r\ncuriosity of aviators. The ratios are those evolved by nature, and,\r\nas such, should be wellnigh perfect. Below is appended a table of the\r\nresults obtained.\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF CERTAIN ANTARCTIC BIRDS IN RELATION TO WING AREAS\r\n\r\n(Stated in pounds per square foot of wing surface)\r\n\r\nEach is the mean of several determinations by Laseron\r\n\r\n     Giant petrel...........  3.5\r\n     Albatross   ...........  2.4\r\n     Antarctic petrel.........  2.1\r\n     Skua gull   ...........  1.6\r\n     Snow petrel ...........  1.1\r\n     Wilson petrel...........  0.6\r\n\r\n     Values from a book of reference quoted for comparison\r\n\r\n     Bat         ...........  0.1\r\n     Sparrow     ...........  0.4\r\n     Wild goose  ...........  1.7\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, for a long period, no seals ventured ashore, though\r\na few were seen swimming in the bay. The force of the wind was so\r\nformidable that even a heavy seal, exposed in the open, broadside-on,\r\nwould be literally blown into the water. This fact was actually observed\r\nout on the harbour-ice. A Weddell seal made twelve attempts to land on\r\na low projecting shelf--an easy feat under ordinary circumstances. The\r\nwind was in the region of eighty-five miles per hour, and every time\r\nthe clumsy, ponderous creature secured its first hold, back it would be\r\ntumbled. Once it managed to raise itself on to the flat surface, and,\r\nafter a breathing spell, commenced to shuffle towards the shelter of\r\nsome pinnacles on one side of the harbour. Immediately its broad flank\r\nwas turned to the wind it was rolled over, hung for a few seconds on\r\nthe brink, and then splashed into the sea. On the other hand, during the\r\nspring, a few more ambitious seals won their way ashore in high winds;\r\nbut they did not remain long in the piercing cold, moving uneasily from\r\nplace to place in search of protecting hummocks and finally taking to\r\nthe water in despair. Often a few hours of calm weather was the signal\r\nfor half a dozen animals to land. The wind sooner or later sprang up and\r\ndrove them back to their warmer element.\r\n\r\nUnder the generic name, seal, are included the true or hair seals and\r\nthe sea-bears or fur seals. Of these the fur seals are sub-polar in\r\ndistribution, inhabiting the cold temperate waters of both hemispheres,\r\nbut never living amongst the polar ice. The southern coast of Australia\r\nand the sub-antarctic islands were their favourite haunts, but the\r\nruthless slaughter of the early days practically exterminated them. From\r\nMacquarie Island, for example, several hundred thousand skins were taken\r\nin a few years, and of late not a single specimen has been seen.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the fur seals are the much larger animals popularly\r\nknown as sea-lions. These still exist in great numbers in south\r\ntemperate waters. Both are distinguished from the hair seals by one\r\nobvious characteristic: their method of propulsion on land is by a\r\n\"lolloping\" motion, in which the front and hind flippers are used\r\nalternately. The hair seals move by a caterpillar-like shuffle, making\r\nlittle or no use of their flippers; and so, the terminal parts of\r\ntheir flippers are not bent outwards as they are in the fur seals and\r\nsea-lions.\r\n\r\nOf the hair seals there are five varieties to be recognized in the\r\nfar South. The Weddell seals, with their mottled-grey coats, are the\r\ncommonest. They haunt the coasts of Antarctica and are seldom found at\r\nany distance from them. Large specimens of this species reach nine and a\r\nhalf feet in length.\r\n\r\nThe crab-eater seal, a smaller animal, lives mostly on the pack-ice.\r\nLying on a piece of floe in the sunshine it has a glistening,\r\nsilver-grey skin--another distinguishing mark being its small, handsome\r\nhead and short, thin neck. Small crustaceans form its principal food.\r\n\r\nThe Ross seal, another inhabitant of the pack-ice, is short and\r\nbulky, varying from a pale yellowish-green on the under side to a dark\r\ngreenish-brown on the back. Its neck is ample and bloated, and when\r\ndistended in excitement reminds one of a pouter-pigeon. This rare seal\r\nappears to subsist mainly on squid and jelly-fish.\r\n\r\nThe sea-leopard, the only predacious member of the seal family, has an\r\nelongated agile body and a large head with massive jaws. In general it\r\nhas a mottled skin, darker towards the back. It lives on fish, penguins\r\nand seals. Early in April, Hurley and McLean were the first to obtain\r\nproof that the sea-leopard preyed on other seals. Among the broken\r\nfloe-ice close beneath the ice-cliffs to the west of Winter Quarters,\r\nthe wind was driving the dead body of a Weddell seal which swept\r\npast them, a few yards distant, to the open water. Then it was that\r\na sea-leopard was observed tearing off and swallowing great pieces of\r\nflesh and blubber from the carcase.\r\n\r\nThe last variety of hair seal, the sea elephant, varies considerably\r\nfrom the preceding. Reference has already been made to the species\r\nearlier in the narrative. The habitat of these monstrous animals ranges\r\nover the cold, south-temperate seas; sea elephants are but occasional\r\nvisitors to the ice-bound regions. Although they have been exterminated\r\nin many other places, one of their most populous resorts at the present\r\nday is Macquarie Island.\r\n\r\nIn the case of all the hair seals a layer of blubber several inches in\r\nthickness invests the body beneath the skin and acts as a conserver of\r\nwarmth. They are largely of value for the oil produced by rendering down\r\nthe blubber. The pelts are used for leather.\r\n\r\nThe operation of skinning seals for specimens, in low temperatures and\r\nin the inevitable wind, was never unduly protracted. We were satisfied\r\nmerely to strip off the skin, leaving much blubber still adhering to it.\r\nIn this rough condition it was taken into the work-room of the Hut to\r\nbe cleaned. The blubber froze, and then had the consistency of hard soap\r\nand was readily severed from the pelt. It was found that there exuded\r\namongst the frozen blubber a thin oil which remained liquid when\r\ncollected and exposed to low temperatures. This oil was used to\r\nlubricate the anemometer and other instruments exposed outside.\r\n\r\nThe main part of the biological work lay in the marine collections.\r\nHunter with the small hand-dredge brought up abundant samples of life\r\nfrom depths ranging to fifty fathoms. In water shallower than ten\r\nfathoms the variety of specimens was not great, including seaweeds up to\r\neighteen or more feet in length, a couple of forms of starfish, various\r\nsmall mollusca, two or three varieties of fish, several sea-spiders,\r\nhydroids and lace corals, and, in great profusion, worms and small\r\ncrustaceans. In deeper waters the life became much richer, so that\r\nexamples of almost every known class of marine animals were represented.\r\n\r\nEarly in June the sea bottom in depths less than ten fathoms had become\r\nso coated with ice that dredging in shallow water was suspended.\r\n\r\nFloating or swimming freely were examples of pteropods, worms,\r\ncrustaceans, ostracods, and jelly-fish. These were easily taken in the\r\nhand-net.\r\n\r\nIn those regions where ice and water are intermingled, the temperature\r\nof the water varies very slightly in summer and winter, remaining\r\napproximately at freezing-point. In summer the tendency to heating is\r\nneutralized by a solution of some of the ice, and in winter the cold is\r\nabsorbed in the production of a surface layer of ice. This constancy of\r\nthe sea's temperature is favourable to organic life. On land there is a\r\nwide range in temperature, and only the meagre mosses and lichens, and\r\nthe forms of insect life which live among them can exist, because they\r\nhave developed the capacity of suspending animation during the winter.\r\nThe fresh-water lakelets were found to be inhabited by low forms of\r\nlife, mainly microscopic. Among these were diatoms, algae, protozoa,\r\nrotifera, and bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe last-named were investigated by McLean and were found to be manifold\r\nin distribution. Besides those from the intestines of animals and birds,\r\ncultures were successfully made from the following natural sources:\r\nlichen soil, moss soil, morainic mud, guano, ice and snow. The results\r\nmay open some new problems in bacteriology.\r\n\r\nOf recent years much attention has been given to the study of\r\nparasites--parasitology. Parasites may be external, on the skin;\r\ninternal, in the alimentary canal; or resident, in the corpuscles of the\r\nblood. In tropical countries, where there is great promiscuity of life,\r\none is led to expect their almost universal presence. But in polar\r\nregions, where infection and intimate co-habitation for long periods are\r\nnot the rule, while the climate is not favourable to organic existence,\r\none would be surprised to find them in any great number. The fact\r\nremains that internal parasites were found in the intestine of every\r\nanimal and fish examined, and in all the birds except the Wilson petrel.\r\nExternal parasites were present on every species of bird and seal,\r\nthough individuals were often free of them. This was so in the case of\r\nthe Adelie penguins. It is a demonstration of the protective warmth of\r\nthe feathers that Emperor penguins may harbour insect parasites in great\r\nnumbers. It is only less wonderful than the fact that they are able\r\nto rear their young during the Antarctic winter. A large number\r\nof blood-slides were prepared and stained for examination for\r\nblood-parasites.\r\n\r\nSearching for \"fleas\" amongst the feathers of birds and the hair\r\nof seals, or examining the viscera for \"worms\" is neither of them a\r\npleasant occupation. To be really successful, the enthusiasm of the\r\nspecialist is necessary. Hunter allowed no opportunities to pass and\r\nsecured a fine collection of parasites.\r\n\r\nAmongst other work, McLean carried out monthly observations on six men,\r\ndetermining the colour-index and haemoglobin value of their blood over\r\na period of ten months. The results showed a distinct and upward rise\r\nabove the normal.\r\n\r\nAmong societies privileged to see the daily paper and to whom diversity\r\nand change are as the breath of life, the weather is apt to be tabooed\r\nas a subject of conversation. But even the most versatile may suddenly\r\nfind themselves stripped of ideas, ignominiously reduced to the obvious\r\ntopic. To us, instead of being a mere prelude to more serious matters,\r\nor the last resort of a feeble intellect, it was the all-engrossing\r\ntheme. The man with the latest hare-brained theory of the causation\r\nof the wind was accorded a full hearing. The lightning calculator who\r\nestimated the annual tonnage of drift-snow sweeping off Adelie Land was\r\nreceived as a futurist and thinker. Discussion was always free, and the\r\nsubject was never thrashed out. Evidence on the great topic accumulated\r\nday by day and month by month; yet there was no one without an innate\r\nhope that winter would bring calm weather or that spring-time, at least,\r\nmust be propitious.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the meteorologist accepted things as he found them, supplied\r\nthe daily facts of wind-mileage and direction, amount of drift,\r\ntemperature and so forth, which were immediately seized by more\r\nvivacious minds and made the basis of daring speculations.\r\n\r\nThe daily facts were increased by the construction of a new instrument\r\nknown as the puffometer. It was entirely a home-made contrivance,\r\ndesigned to measure the speed of heavy gusts of wind. A small aluminium\r\nsphere was arranged to blow out at the end of a light cord exerting\r\ntension on a calibrated spring. The pull was transferred to a lever\r\ncarrying a pencil, which travelled across a disk of carbonized paper.\r\nThe disk, moving by clockwork, made a complete revolution every hour.\r\nThe recording parts of the instrument were enclosed in a snow-proof box\r\nin which there was a small aperture on the leeward side, through which\r\nran the cord attachment of the sphere. This may give a rough idea of\r\nthe apparatus employed to measure the momentary velocity of the cyclonic\r\ngusts. The idea is not an original one, having been previously applied\r\nfor use on kites.\r\n\r\nIt was not always possible to use the puffometer in the strongest gusts\r\nbecause these were often transient, occurring unexpectedly or during the\r\nnight; while it took a little time to get the instrument into running\r\norder. Even in daylight, with the landscape clear of drift, it was a\r\ntime-absorbing and difficult task to secure a record.\r\n\r\nTwo men start from the Hut with iron crampons and a full complement of\r\nclothes and mitts. Outside they find themselves in a rushing torrent\r\nof air, pulsating with mighty gust-waves. Lowered from the estate\r\nof upright manhood, they humbly crawl, or make a series of crouching\r\nsprints between the gusts. Over the scattered boulders to the east of\r\nthe Hut, across a patch of polished snow they push to the first low\r\nridge, and there they stop for breath. Up on the side of \"Annie Hill,\"\r\nin the local phrase, the tide sweeps by with fiendish strength, and\r\namong the jagged rocks the man clutching the puffometer-box has a few\r\ndesperate falls. At last both clamber slowly to an eminence where a long\r\nsteel pipe has been erected. To the top of this the puffometer is hauled\r\nby means of a pulley and line. At the same time the aluminium sphere is\r\nreleased, and out it floats in the wind tugging at the spring.\r\n\r\nThe puffometer was left out for an hour at a time, and separate gusts up\r\nto one hundred and fifty and one hundred and eighty miles per hour were\r\ncommonly indicated. I remember the final fate of this invention. While\r\nhelping to mount it one day, the wind picked me up clear of the ground\r\nand dashed myself and the instrument on some rocks several yards away.\r\nThe latter was badly damaged, but thick clothing saved me from serious\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nThe wind velocity and wind direction charts for Midwinter's Day,\r\nwhen the steady south-by-east gale was broken after noon by a welcome\r\nlull--the wind veering the while all round the compass.\r\n\r\nThe average velocity for the day 66.9 miles per hour, and the maximum of\r\nthe average hourly velocities, ninety-six miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steadiness of the temperature was a subject for debate. The stronger\r\nthe wind blew, the less variation did the thermometer show. Over a\r\nperiod of several days there might be a range of only four or five\r\ndegrees. Ordinarily, this might be expected of an insular climate, but\r\nin our case it depended upon the fact that the wind remained steady from\r\nthe interior of the vast frigid continent. The air which flowed over the\r\nHut had all passed through the same temperature-cycle. The atmosphere\r\nof the interior, where the plateau stood at an elevation of, say, eight\r\nthousand feet, might have a temperature -45 degrees F. As the air\r\nflowed northwards over Adelie Land to the sea, it would rise slowly in\r\ntemperature owing to the increased barometric pressure consequent on the\r\ndescending gradient of the plateau. At sea-level the temperature of the\r\nriver of air would be, approximately, -20 degrees F.\r\n\r\nSuch a rise in temperature due to compression is a well-known\r\nphenomenon, referred to as the Foehn effect.\r\n\r\nThe compression of the atmosphere during the gusts affected the air\r\ntemperature so considerably that, coincident with their passage, the\r\nmercury column could often be seen rising and falling through several\r\ndegrees. The uniform conditions experienced during steady high winds\r\nwere not only expressed by the slight variation in the temperature,\r\nbut often in a remarkably even barometric curve. Thus on July 11 the\r\nwind-velocity for twenty-four hours was, throughout, seventy miles per\r\nhour; the temperature remaining within a few degrees of-21 degrees F.,\r\nand the barometric curve did not show as much range as one-twentieth of\r\nan inch.\r\n\r\nIn attending to the many instruments and in gathering the voluminous\r\nmeteorological data, Madigan had his hands very full. Throughout two\r\nyears he carried on the work capably and thoroughly. It was difficult to\r\nkeep the instruments free from the penetrating snow and in good running\r\norder. The Robinson anemometer was perhaps the greatest source of\r\nworry. Repairs and readjustments were unavoidable, as the instrument\r\nwas constantly working at high pressure. In order that these might be\r\ncarried out efficiently, the whole apparatus had to be carried down to\r\nthe Hut. Here, Bickerton and Correll were continually in consultation\r\nwith the meteorologist on the latest breakdown. Cups were blown off\r\nseveral times, and one was lost and replaced with difficulty. Most\r\naggravating of all was a habit the clocks developed of stopping during\r\nthe colder spells. The old-fashioned method of boiling them was found\r\nof assistance, but it was discovered that the best treatment was to put\r\nthem through successive baths of benzene and alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe most chronic sufferer throughout the vicissitudes of temperature was\r\nthe clock belonging to Bage's tide-gauge. Every sleeper in the Hut who\r\nwas sensitive to ticking knew and reviled that clock. So often was it\r\nsubjected to warm, curative treatment in various resting-places that\r\nit was hunted from pillar to post. A radical operation by Correll--the\r\ninsertion of an extra spring--became necessary at last. Correll,\r\nwhen not engaged designing electroscopes, improving sledge-meters and\r\nperfecting theodolites, was something of a specialist in clocks. His\r\nadvice on the subject of refractory time-pieces was freely asked and\r\ncheerfully given. By perseverance and unlimited patience, the tide-gauge\r\ndown on the harbour-ice was induced to supply a good series of unbroken\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nThe tide-gauge\r\n\r\nThe rise and fall of the tide is coincident with the movements of\r\na perpendicular wire to which the Float is attached. The Wheel is\r\nrevolved, and through wire connections (indicated above) displaces\r\nvertically the Pen. This traces a record on paper folded on the drum\r\nwhich is driven by clockwork. In all weathers, the box was enveloped in\r\ndrift-proof canvas.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntarctica is a world of colour, brilliant and intensely pure. The\r\nchaste whiteness of the snow and the velvet blackness of the rocks\r\nbelong to days of snowy nimbus enshrouding the horizon. When the sky has\r\nbroken into cloudlets of fleece, their edges are painted pale orange,\r\nfading or richly glowing if the sun is low. In the high sun they are\r\nrainbow-rimmed.\r\n\r\nThe clouds have opened into rifts and the sun is setting in the\r\nnorth-west. The widening spaces in the zenith are azure, and low in the\r\nnorth they are emerald. Scenic changes are swift. Above the mounting\r\nplateau a lofty arch of clear sky has risen, flanked by roseate clouds.\r\nFar down in the south it is tinged with indigo and ultramarine, washed\r\nwith royal purple paling onwards into cold violet and greyish-blue.\r\n\r\nSoon the north is unveiled. The liquid globe of sun has departed,\r\nbut his glory still remains. Down from the zenith his colours descend\r\nthrough greenish-blue, yellowish-green, straw-yellow, light terra-cotta\r\nto a diffuse brick-red; each reflected in the dull sheen of freezing\r\nsea. Out on the infinite horizon float icebergs in a mirage of mobile\r\ngold. The Barrier, curving to east and west, is a wall of delicate pink\r\noverlaid with a wondrous mauve--the rising plateau. A cold picture--yet\r\nit awakens the throb of inborn divinity.\r\n\r\nDespite contrary predictions, there were some enjoyable days in June.\r\nOccupation had to be strenuous, making the blood run hot, otherwise the\r\nwind was apt to be chill. So the Transit House was founded, and there\r\nwere many volunteers to assist Bage in carrying the tons of stones which\r\nformed its permanent base. The nearest large collection of boulders was\r\ntwenty yards away, on the edge of a moraine, but these after a while\r\nbecame exhausted. Plenty of rocks actually showed above the surface, but\r\nthe majority were frozen-in, and, when of suitable size, could only\r\nbe moved by a heavy crowbar. Some of the men, therefore, dislodged the\r\nrocks, while others carried them.\r\n\r\nWhen Bage was wondering how long the supply would last, Ninnis and Mertz\r\ncame to the rescue with sledges and dog-teams. Boxes were piled on\r\nto the sledges and away the teams went, careering across the ice-flat\r\ntowards the Magnetograph House close to which there were many heaps\r\nof stones, wind-swept and easily displaced. Soon a regular service was\r\nplying to the foundations, and, at the same time, the dogs were being\r\ntrained. This occupation was continued, weather permitting, for several\r\nweeks before Midwinter's Day. Thus the drivers gained experience, while\r\nthe animals, with a wholesome dread of the whip, became more responsive\r\nto commands. Eagerly the huskies strained at their traces with excited\r\nyelps. The heavily laden sledges would break out and start off with\r\nincreasing speed over the rough ice. The drivers, running at full speed,\r\njumped on the racing loads--Mertz in the lead shouting some quaint yodel\r\nsong; Ninnis, perhaps, just behind upbraiding a laggard dog.\r\n\r\nMidwinter's Day! For once, the weather rose to the occasion and calmed\r\nduring the few hours of the twilight-day. It was a jovial occasion, and\r\nwe celebrated it with the uproarious delight of a community of eighteen\r\nyoung men unfettered by small conventions. The sun was returning, and we\r\nwere glad of it. Already we were dreaming of spring and sledging, summer\r\nand sledging, the ship and home. It was the turn of the tide, and the\r\nfuture seemed to be sketched in firm, sure outline. While the rest\r\nexplored all the ice-caves and the whole extent of our small\r\nrocky \"selection,\" Hannam and Bickerton shouldered the domestic\r\nresponsibilities. Their menu du diner to us was a marvel of gorgeous\r\ndelicacies. After the toasts and speeches came a musical and dramatic\r\nprogramme, punctuated by choice gramophone records and rowdy student\r\nchoruses.

The clothes\r\nhe wears are many and often cumbersome, but they have gradually been\r\nperfected to meet the demands of the local weather conditions. After a\r\nsojourn in the ice-lands, he returns to civilization with a new concept\r\nof the value of dress. At last he can stand still without being reminded\r\nthat his feet are chilly; he experiences the peculiar sensation of\r\nwalking about in an airily light suit, in glove-tight boots, without\r\nhelmet or mitts. It gives him such a delicious feeling of freedom that\r\nhis energy is unbounded and life is a very pleasant and easy thing. Then\r\nit is that he can turn in retrospect to the time in exile, appreciate\r\nhis altered circumstances and recall the many ingenuities which were\r\nevolved to make him master of his environment.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to say that we found the proposition of clothing one\r\nof unusual interest. Any one who was not a practised needleman and\r\nmachinist was handicapped for a time, until he fell into the ways of the\r\nthrough-and-through and blanket-stitch, thimbles, shuttles, spools and\r\nmany other things he had once affected to despise as belonging to the\r\nsphere of women's work. It was not long before he was an enthusiast in\r\nmany arts attaining to a stage of independence, in which he patented new\r\nideas and maintained them in hot opposition to the whole community of\r\nthe Hut. On some fundamental points all were in agreement, and one\r\nof them was that Adelie Land was the country par excellence for the\r\nwind-proof, drift-tight burberry.\r\n\r\nOutside all other garments the burberry gabardine was worn. The material\r\nwas light and loosely fitting, but in wind and drift it had to be\r\nhermetically sealed, so to speak, for the snow crept in wherever there\r\nwas an aperture. The trousers were of double thickness, as they were\r\nexposed to the greatest wear. Attached by large buttons, toggles or\r\nlampwick braces, they reached as high as the lower part of the chest.\r\nBelow, they had lamp-wick lashings which were securely bound round the\r\nuppers of boots or finnesko. In walking, the trousers would often work\r\noff the leather boots, especially if they were cut to a tailor's\r\nlength, and snow would then pour up the leg and down into the boots in\r\na remarkably short time. To counteract this, Ninnis initiated the very\r\nsatisfactory plan of sewing a short length of canvas on to the boots to\r\nincrease the length of the upper.\r\n\r\nThe burberry helmet and blouse were either in one piece or separate. For\r\nuse round the Hut, in thick drifts, the combination of helmet and blouse\r\nwas handy and time-saving. For sledging, when low temperatures and\r\nstrong winds might be expected all the time, it met the conditions well;\r\nthere being no necessity to worry about keeping the neck drift-tight.\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances it was very convenient to have a blouse\r\nand helmet detached, as one so often could wear the former with a\r\nwell-padded woollen helmet and be reduced only as a last resource to\r\nwearing the burberry helmet.\r\n\r\nThe blouse was roomy, giving great freedom of movement. Around the neck\r\nwas a draw-string, which bunched in the jacket tightly over the lower\r\npart of the helmet. There was also a draw-string round the waist. It\r\nwas here that we had the greatest difficulty in making the garment fit\r\nsnow-tight. If simply tied, the blouse would soon slip up from below,\r\nespecially if one were working with pick and shovel, carrying cases or\r\nblocks of ice. To obviate this, some of the men sewed loops or tags of\r\nlamp-wick on to the sides of the trousers, to connect with corresponding\r\nattachments on the blouse. As an additional security, others wore an\r\noutside belt which was, even if the blouse slipped up for some distance,\r\na line of defence against the drift-snow.\r\n\r\nThe burberry helmet completely enclosed the head except for the face,\r\nwhich remained uncovered at the bottom of a funnel stiffened by several\r\nrings of copper-wire. Lampwick, the universal polar \"cord,\" was sewn\r\nin short strips in front of the ears and tied at the back of the\r\nhead, firmly securing the helmet. Since the voyage of the 'Discovery'\r\n(1901-1904) lamp-wick had been used widely in sledging on account of\r\nits width, softness, comparative warmth and because of the fact that\r\nordinary cord is not so easy to manipulate in cold weather. Large\r\nbuttons of leather or bone were not nearly so popular as small, smooth\r\nlengths of stick engaging cross-wise with loops of cord--known as\r\ntoggles, which became quite a mania with some members of the Expedition.\r\nWhetter, for instance, was known as the \"Toggle King,\" because of the\r\nmultitude of these stick-and-cord appendages which hung from every part\r\nof his clothing.\r\n\r\nUnder the burberrys thick, but light, suits of Jaeger fleece were worn.\r\nThey combined trousers and a sleeveless coat, over which a woollen\r\njersey was worn. In calm weather these with underclothing were\r\nall-sufficient, but in the average fifty-mile wind at any temperature in\r\nthe neighbourhood of zero Fahrenheit, they felt distinctly porous.\r\n\r\nIn less windy weather the luxury of discarding burberrys, either partly\r\nor wholly, was an indulgence which gave great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFinnesko were the favourite foot-gear--soft and commodious reindeer-skin\r\nfur boots. Once these were stuffed with Lapp saennegras or manilla\r\nfibre, and the feet covered with several pairs of socks, cold could\r\nbe despised unless one were stationary for some time or the socks or\r\npadding became damp. Even though the padding were wet, violent exercise\r\nkept the temperature \"balance\" in the warm direction, especially if one\r\nwere also under the stimulus of a recent hot meal.\r\n\r\nOf course, on smooth ice or polished snow in even moderate winds it was\r\nuseless to try and keep one's feet in finnesko, although practice gave\r\ngreat agility in calmer weather. As already indicated, spiked crampons\r\non approved models, tested on the glacier-slopes in a hurricane wind,\r\nwere almost always worn encasing the finnesko. With so many coverings\r\nthe feet often became uncomfortably hot, and for odd jobs about the Hut\r\nand not far abroad spiked leather boots gave most satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThere were various coverings for the hands: felt mitts, mittens,\r\ninstrument-gloves and wolfskin mitts.\r\n\r\nThe first were used in conjunction with fingerless mittens. The wear and\r\ntear on these was greater than on any other item of clothing. It was a\r\ncommon sight to see them ragged, canvas-covered, patched, repatched and\r\nagain repatched, to be at last reluctantly thrown away. There were two\r\ncompartments in a single glove, one for the thumb and the other for the\r\nfingers. It is much easier to keep the fingers warm when in contact with\r\none another than by having them in separate stalls.\r\n\r\nInstrument-gloves of wool were used for delicate manipulations, as a\r\npartial protection, since they reduced the stinging chill of cold metal\r\nat low temperatures.\r\n\r\nWolfskin mitts are unexcelled for use in cold windy weather. Their\r\nshaggy external hair entangles the drift-snow, which thaws, soaks the\r\nskin and refreezes until the mitt is stiff as buckram. This is their\r\nmain disadvantage. These mitts or rather gauntlets were made longer in\r\nthe arms than usual so as to overlap the burberry sleeves and keep the\r\nwrists warm.\r\n\r\nLambskin mitts with the wool facing inwards were very useful and wore\r\nwell for occupations like hauling on ropes and lifting cases.\r\n\r\nLike every other movable thing, mitts had to be made fast to prevent\r\nthem blowing away. So they were slung round the neck by a yoke of\r\nlamp-wick. The mittened hand could then be removed with the assurance\r\nthat the outer mitt would not be far away when it was wanted, no matter\r\nhow hard the wind blew.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to the relative merits of fur and\r\nwoollen clothing. After all the question has resolved itself into one\r\nof personal predilection. It has been claimed that furs are warmer and\r\nlighter. The warmth follows from the wind-proof quality of the hide\r\nwhich, unfortunately, also tends to retain moist exhalations from the\r\nbody. In Adelie Land, the only furs we used were finnesko, wolfskin\r\nmitts and sleeping-bags of reindeer skins.\r\n\r\nAs in every part of the equipment, modifications had to be made in the\r\ncircular Willesden-drill tents. To facilitate their erection in the\r\nperpetual winds they were sewn permanently on to the five bamboo poles,\r\ninstead of being thrown over the latter previously set in position. Thus\r\nthe tents opened like large conical umbrellas. A rawhide loop was fixed\r\nto the middle one of the three windward legs and, when raising a tent\r\nduring a high wind, it was the usual thing for a man to be inside\r\ngripping the loop to pin down the windward legs and at the same time,\r\nkicking out the two leeward legs. On hard surfaces, holes were dug to\r\nreceive the ends of the poles; at other times they were pressed home\r\ninto the snow by the man inside the tent.\r\n\r\nWhen pitched, the tent was held down by blocks of snow or ice, helped\r\nby spare food-bags, which were all piled round on a broad flounce.\r\nVentilators, originally supplied with the tents, had to be dispensed\r\nwith on account of the incessant drift. The door of the tent was an oval\r\nfunnel of burberry material just large enough to admit a man and secured\r\nby a draw-string.\r\n\r\nStrips of calico and webbing were sewn over the insides of the light\r\ntents to strengthen them for sledging in the summer. For heavy weather\r\nwe also had japara sail-cloth tents with Willesden canvas flounces.\r\nThese gave one a feeling of greater security and were much more\r\nwind-proof, but unfortunately twice as heavy as the first-mentioned.\r\n\r\nA floor-cloth of light Willesden canvas covered the surface of snow\r\nor ice in the interior of the tent; performing when sledging the\r\nalternative office of a sail.\r\n\r\nIn order to cut snow, neve or ice to pile on the flounce, a pick and\r\nspade had to be included in the sledging equip meet. As a rule, a\r\nstrong, pointed shovel weighing about six pounds answers very well;\r\nbut in Adelie Land, the surface was so often wind-swept ice, polished\r\nporcelain-snow, or hard neve that a pick was necessary to make any\r\nimpression upon it. It was found that a four-pound spade, carefully\r\nhandled, and a four-pound miner's pick provided against all emergencies.\r\n\r\nOur sledges were similar to those of other British Antarctic\r\nexpeditions; of eleven- and twelve-foot lengths. The best were\r\nNorwegian, made of ash and hickory. Others built in Sydney, of\r\nAustralian woods, were admirably suited for special work. Those made of\r\nmountain-ash had the advantage of being extremely light, but the runners\r\nwore out quickly on ice and hard neve. Sledges of powellized spotted gum\r\nwere very strong and stood plenty of rough usage, but were heavier\r\nthan those procured in Norway. A decking of bamboo slats secured by\r\ncopper-wire to the crossbars was usually employed.\r\n\r\nA light bamboo mast and spar were fitted to each sledge. Immediately\r\nin front of the mast came the \"cooker-box,\" containing in respective\r\ncompartments the primus and a bottle of spirit for lighting it, as well\r\nas spare prickers, openers and fillers for the kerosene tins, repair\r\noutfits and other odd articles. The cooker-boxes were of Venesta board,\r\nwith hinged lids secured by chocks and overlapped by japara cloth to\r\nexclude as much drift-snow as possible. An instrument-box was secured to\r\nthe sledge near the rear and just forward of a Venesta or aluminium\r\ntray on which the kerosene contained in one-gallon tins was carried. In\r\nseveral cases the tray was widened to receive as well a case containing\r\na dip-circle. Rearmost of all was a wooden crosspiece to which the\r\nshaft of the sledge-meter was attached through a universal joint. On the\r\nmiddle section of the sledge between the cooker-box and instrument-box,\r\nsleeping-bags, food-bags, clothes-bags, tent, alpine rope, theodolite\r\nlegs, and other articles, were arranged, packed and immovably stiffened\r\nby buckled straps passing from side to side.\r\n\r\nSledging harness for both men and dogs was constructed of canvas. In the\r\nformer case, a wide belt of triple thickness encircled the body at the\r\nhips, sewn to braces of narrower strips passing over the shoulders,\r\nwhile hauling-rope was attached to the belt behind. The strength of the\r\nwhole depended on the care bestowed in sewing the parts together, and,\r\nsince his life might depend upon it, no one made anything else but a\r\nthorough job of his harness.\r\n\r\nNinnis and Mertz ran a tailoring business for the dogs, who were brought\r\none by one into the outer Hut to be measured for harness. After many\r\nlengths had been cut with scissors the canvas bands were put through and\r\nsewn together on the large sewing-machine and then each dog was fitted\r\nand the final alterations were made. The huskies looked quite smart in\r\ntheir \"suits\".\r\n\r\nUpon the primus heater, alone, did we rely for cooking the meals on\r\nsledging journeys. First used for purposes of sledging by Dr. Nansen in\r\nhis journey across Greenland, the primus is only economically managed\r\nafter some practice. To light a primus in a draughty tent at a low\r\ntemperature calls for some forbearance before one is a thorough master\r\nof the art. A sledging cook will often make a disagreeable faux pas\r\nby extinguishing the primus in the preparation of hoosh. This is most\r\nreadily done by lowering too quickly the outside cover over the rest\r\nof the cooker. Fumes of vaporizing kerosene soon fill the tent and when\r\nmatches are found, the cooker pulled to pieces, the primus relighted and\r\nthe choking vapours have cleared, one is apt to think that all is well.\r\nThe hoosh is quite as successful as usual, but the cocoa, made from\r\nwater in the annulus, has a tincture of kerosene which cannot be\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Nansen Cooker,\" which we used, a maximum result is secured\r\nfrom the heat of the primus. The hot gases from the combustion of the\r\nkerosene, before they escape into the outside air, have to circulate\r\nalong a tortuous path, passing from the hot interior to the colder\r\nexterior compartments, losing heat all the time. Thus a hot hoosh is\r\npreparing in the central vessel side by side with the melting of snow\r\nfor cocoa or tea in the annulus. By the combination of \"Nansen Cooker\"\r\nand primus stove one gallon of kerosene oil properly husbanded is made\r\nto last for twelve days in the preparation of the ordinary ration for\r\nthree men.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nSection through a Nansen Sledging Cooker mounted on the primus\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of food is one which requires peculiar consideration\r\nand study. It is assumed that a polar expedition must carry all its\r\nfood-stuffs in that variety and quantity which may approximately satisfy\r\nnormal demands. Fortunately, the advance of science has been such that\r\nnecessaries like vegetables, fruit, meats and milk are now preserved so\r\nthat the chances of bacterial contamination are reduced to a minimum. A\r\ncold climate is an additional security towards the same end.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, while living for months in an Antarctic hut, it is a\r\nsplendid thing to have more than the mere necessaries of life. Since\r\none is cut off from the ordinary amenities of social existence, it is\r\nparticularly necessary that equipment and food should be of the very\r\nbest; in some measure to replace a lack which sooner or later makes\r\nitself keenly felt. Explorers, after all, are only mortal.\r\n\r\nLuxuries, then, are good in moderation, and mainly for their\r\npsychological effect. After a spell of routine, a celebration is the\r\nnatural sequel, and if there are delicacies which in civilization are\r\nmore palatable than usual, why not take them to where they will receive\r\na still fuller and heartier appreciation? There is a corresponding rise\r\nin the \"tide of life\" and the ennui of the same task, in the same\r\nplace, in the same wind, is not so noticeable. So we did not forget our\r\nasparagus and jugged hare.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of sledging foods, one comes down to a solid basis of\r\ndietetics. But even dietetics as a science has to stand aside when\r\nactual experience speaks. Dietetics deals with proteins, carbohydrates,\r\nfats, and calories: all terms which need definition and comprehension\r\nbefore the value of a sledging ration can be fundamentally understood.\r\nWhen the subject was first introduced into table conversation at the\r\nHut, it was regarded somewhat suspiciously as \"shop.\" But it gradually\r\nwon interest simply because it was of such vital concern.\r\n\r\nIn sledging there is undoubtedly a critical allowance which will yield\r\nthe best results. Circumstances alter cases, and the correct ration\r\nunder one set of conditions cannot be expected to coincide with that in\r\nanother situation. Thus, the journey may be conducted under conditions\r\nof great cold or of comparative warmth, by man-hauling or auxiliary\r\npower, at sea-level or on an altitude, through regions where there is\r\na reasonable hope of securing additions of meat by the way, or across\r\nbarren tracts devoid of game. In each instance particular demands must\r\nbe supplied.\r\n\r\nIn selecting the articles of diet, idiosyncrasies of individuals should\r\nbe consulted in reason, and under no consideration should anything be\r\ntaken which bears the slightest stigma of contamination. It remains,\r\nthen, to discriminate those foods which contribute the greatest amount\r\nof nutriment for a given weight, and which, inter se, preserve a proper\r\ndietetic balance. Variety is very desirable, provided that there is no\r\nimportant sacrifice in nutrient value. The proof of a wisely selected\r\nration is to find at the end of a long sledge journey that the sole\r\ncraving is for an increase in the ration. Of course, such would be the\r\nideal result of a perfect ration, which does not exist.\r\n\r\nConsidering that an ordinary individual in civilization may only satisfy\r\nthe choice demands of his appetite by selecting from the multifarious\r\nbill of fare of a modern restaurant, it will be evident that the same\r\nperson, though already on the restricted diet of an explorer, cannot\r\nbe suddenly subjected to a sledging ration for any considerable period\r\nwithout a certain exercise of discipline.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Eastern Coastal Party, sledging at fairly high\r\ntemperatures over the sea-ice, noted that the full ration of hoosh\r\nproduced at times a mild indigestion, they drank much liquid to satisfy\r\nan intense thirst and on returning to the Hut found their appetites\r\ninclined to tinned fruit and penguins' eggs. Bickerton's and Bage's\r\nparties, though working at a much higher altitude, had a similar\r\nexperience. The former, for instance, could not at first drink the whole\r\nallowance of thick, rich cocoa without a slight nausea. The latter saved\r\nrations during the first two weeks of their journey, and only when they\r\nrose to greater heights and were in fine condition did they appreciate\r\nthe ration to the full. Again, even when one becomes used to the ration,\r\nthe sensation of full satisfaction does not last for more than an hour.\r\nThe imagination reaches forward to the next meal, perhaps partly on\r\naccount of the fact that marching is often monotonous and the scenery\r\nuninspiring. Still, even after a good evening hoosh, the subconscious\r\nself may assert itself in food-dreams. The reaction from even a short\r\nsledging trip, where food has been plentiful, is to eat a good deal,\r\nastonishing in amount to those who for the time being have lived at the\r\nHut.\r\n\r\nIt may appear that a serious case is being made against the polar\r\nsledging ration. On the whole, it was found to be excellent and the best\r\nthat experience had been able to devise. Entering the polar zones, one\r\nmust not be over-fastidious, but take it as a matter of course that\r\nthere will be self-denial and deprivation of small luxuries.\r\n\r\nThe energy exerted by man, and the requirements of tissue-building\r\nare derived from the organic compounds known as proteins,** fats and\r\ncarbohydrates, though in a slight degree from other substances, most\r\nimportant of which are minute quantities of mineral matter.\r\n\r\nA calorie as used in dietetics is the amount of heat required to raise\r\nthe temperature of one kilogramme of water at 0 degrees C. to 1 degree\r\nC. The heat-value of food-stuffs, stated in calories, can be quickly\r\nreckoned when chemical analyses stating their protein, fat and\r\ncarbohydrate contents are available. It has been ascertained that one\r\ngramme of protein or carbohydrate yields 4.1 calories, whilst the same\r\namount of fat produces 9.3 calories. Thus the value of fat-containing\r\nfoods in a sledging ration is at once apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** The proteins are complex nitrogenous compounds which are preeminent\r\nin fulfilling the two functions of a food: to form tissue and to produce\r\nwork and heat. As examples may be quoted, myosin the chief protein of\r\nordinary meat or muscle, ovalbumin one of the proteins of egg-white,\r\ncasein belonging to milk and cheese, and gluten a protein-mixture in\r\nflour.\r\n\r\nFats are organic non-nitrogenous substances obtained from both animal\r\nand vegetable sources, e.g. butter and olive oil.\r\n\r\nThe carbohydrates are compounds of carbon with hydrogen and oxygen in a\r\ncertain proportion, e.g. cane-sugar and starch.\r\n\r\nMineral matters are inorganic, being chlorides, carbonates or phosphates\r\nof calcium, sodium and potassium.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheoretically, any of the three classes of foods mentioned might be\r\nthought to supply adequate energy, if taken in sufficient amount.\r\nPractically, however, protein and carbohydrate are essential, and it is\r\nbetter to have a mixture of all three. So, in concentrating foods for\r\nsledging, the largest possible proportion of fat, compatible with other\r\nconsiderations, is included.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, a normal man consumes some four or five pounds weight of\r\nsolid food per diem, of which 50 per cent., it is rather surprising to\r\nlearn, is water. When sledging, one has the satisfaction of knowing that\r\nall but the smallest quantity of the food dragged is solid nutriment.\r\nThe water is added when the meals are cooked. It is just in this\r\nartificial addition that the sledging ration is not perfect, though as a\r\nsynthesis it satisfies the demands of dietetics. Food containing water,\r\nas cooked meat oozing with its own gravy is a more palatable thing than\r\ndried meat-powder to which boiling water has been added. In the same\r\nway, a dry, hard biscuit plus liquid is a different thing from a spongy\r\nloaf of yeast bread with its high percentage of water. One must reckon\r\nwith the psychic factor in eating. When sledging, one does not look for\r\nfood well served as long as the food is hot, nourishing and filling. So\r\nthe usage of weeks and a wolfish appetite make hoosh a most delicious\r\npreparation; but when the days of an enforced ration are over, the\r\ndesire for appetizing well-served food reasserts itself. The body\r\nrefuses to be treated merely as an engine.\r\n\r\nThe daily polar sledging ration for one man has been concentrated to\r\na figure just above two pounds in weight, For instance, in recent\r\nAntarctic expeditions, Scott, in 1903, used 34.7 ozs., Shackleton in\r\n1908 used 34.82 ozs. and our own amounted to 34.25 ozs. Exclusive of\r\ntea, pepper and salt, Shackleton's ration and that adopted by Wild at\r\nthe Western Base and ourselves in Adelie Land were identical--34 ozs.\r\nReverting to earlier explorers, for the sake of comparisons, McClintock\r\nin 1850 brought his minimum down to 42 ozs., Nares in 1875 to 40 ozs.,\r\nGreely in 1882 to 41.75 ozs., and Abruzzi in 1900 to 43.5 ozs.\r\n\r\nOur allowance was made up as follows, the relative amounts in the daily\r\nsledging ration for one man being stated: plasmon biscuit, 12 ozs.;\r\npemmican, 8 ozs.; butter, 2 ozs.; plasmon chocolate, 2 ozs.; glaxo\r\n(dried milk), 5 ozs.; sugar, 4 ozs.; cocoa, 1 oz.; tea,.25 oz. It will\r\nbe instructive to make a short note on each item.\r\n\r\nPlasmon biscuit was made of the best flour mixed with 30 per cent. of\r\nplasmon powder. Each biscuit weighed 2.25 ozs., and was made specially\r\nthick and hard to resist shaking and bumping in transit as well as the\r\nrough usage of a sledging journey. The effect of the high percentage\r\nof plasmon, apart from its nutritive value, was to impart additional\r\ntoughness to the biscuit, which tested our teeth so severely that we\r\nshould have preferred something less like a geological specimen and more\r\nlike ordinary \"hard tack,\" The favourite method of dealing with these\r\nbiscuits was to smash them with an ice-axe or nibble them into small\r\npieces and treat the fragments for a while to the solvent action of\r\nhot cocoa. Two important proteins were present in this food: plasmon, a\r\ntrade-name for casein, the chief protein of milk, and gluten, a mixture\r\nof proteins in flour.\r\n\r\nThe pemmican we used consisted of powdered dried beef (containing the\r\nimportant protein, myosin) and 50 per cent. of pure fat in the form of\r\nlard. The large content of fat contributes to its high caloric value,\r\nso that it is regularly included in sledging diets. Hoosh is a stodgy,\r\nporridge-like mixture of pemmican, dried biscuit and water, brought to\r\nthe boil and served hot. Some men prefer it cooler and more dilute, and\r\nto this end dig up snow from the floor of the tent with their spoons,\r\nand mix it in until the hoosh is \"to taste,\" Eating hoosh is a\r\nheightened form of bliss which no sledger can ever forget.\r\n\r\nGlaxo is a proprietary food preparation of dried milk, manufactured in\r\nNew Zealand. It is without doubt an ideal food for any climate where\r\nconcentration is desirable and asepsis cannot be neglected. The value of\r\nmilk as an all-round food is well known. It contains protein as casein,\r\nfat as cream and in fine globules, carbohydrate as lactose (milk sugar)\r\nand mineral substances whose importance is becoming more recognized.\r\nAt the Western Base, Wild's party invented glaxo biscuits; an unbaked\r\nmixture of flour and dried milk, which were in themselves a big\r\ninducement to go sledging. At the Hut, making milk from the dried powder\r\nrequired some little experience. Cold water was added to the dried\r\npowder, a paste was made and warm or hot water poured in until the milk\r\nwas at the required strength. One of the professional \"touches\" was to\r\naerate the milk, after mixing, by pouring it from jug to jug.\r\n\r\nButter, although it contains nearly 20 per cent. of water is a food of\r\nhigh heat-value and is certainly more easily digested than fat, such as\r\ndripping, with a higher melting-point. Ours was fresh Victorian butter,\r\npacked in the ordinary export boxes, and carried to the Antarctic on the\r\nopen bridge of the Aurora. With a sheath-knife, the sledging cook cut\r\noff three small chunks of two ounces each from the frozen butter every\r\nday at lunch. To show how the appetite is affected by extreme cold,\r\none feels that butter is a wholesome thing just in itself, being more\r\ninclined to eat a pound than two ounces.\r\n\r\nSugar--the carbohydrate, sucrose--has special qualities as a food since\r\nit is quickly assimilated, imparting within a few minutes fresh energy\r\nfor muscular exertion. Athletes will support this; in fact, a strong\r\nsolution of sugar in water is used as a stimulant in long-distance\r\nrunning and other feats of endurance. Wild, for instance, found as\r\na matter of experience that chocolate was preferable to cheese as a\r\nsledging food, even though similar weights had approximately the same\r\nfood-value.\r\n\r\nCocoa and tea were the two sledging beverages. The cocoa was used for\r\ntwo meals, the first and the last in the day, and the tea for lunch.\r\nBoth contain stimulating alkaloids, theobromine and caffeine, and fat is\r\na notable constituent of cocoa. Of course, their chief nourishing value,\r\nas far as we were concerned, lay in the glaxo and sugar added.\r\n\r\nLastly, plasmon chocolate is a preparation of pure chocolate (a mixture\r\nof ground cocoa, white sugar and starch) with the addition of 10 per\r\ncent. of plasmon.\r\n\r\nAs food for the dogs, there was nothing better than dried seal-steaks\r\nwith the addition of a little blubber. Ordinary pemmican is readily\r\neaten, but not appreciated by the dogs in the same way as seal meat.\r\nTo save weight, the meat was dried over the stove without heating it\r\nsufficiently to cook it. By this measure, almost 50 per cent. in weight\r\nwas saved.\r\n\r\nThe Hut was all agog with movement and bustle on the days when rations\r\nwere being made up and packed. Starting from the earliest stage in\r\nthe process, there would be two men in the outer Hut grinding plasmon\r\nbiscuit into powder. One would turn away for dear life and the other\r\nsmash the biscuit with a hammer on a metal slab and feed continuously\r\ninto the grinder. The atmosphere would be full of the nauseous vapours\r\nof blubber arising from dishes on the stove where seal meat was drying\r\nfor the dogs. Ninnis and Mertz superintended in this department, in\r\ncareless moments allowing the blubber to frizzle and diffuse its aroma\r\nthrough the Hut.\r\n\r\nInside, spread along the eighteen-foot table would be the weighers, the\r\nbag-makers or machinists, and the packers. The first made up a compound\r\nof cocoa, glaxo and sugar--cocoa compound; mixed glaxo and sugar and\r\nstirred together, pemmican and biscuit--pemmican compound. These were\r\nweighed and run into calico bags, rapidly supplied by several machinists\r\nfarther along the table. In spare moments the weighers stowed chocolate,\r\nwhole biscuits, butter and tea into 190 sacks of various sizes. Lastly,\r\nthe packers had strong canvas tanks, as they were called, designed\r\nto hold food for a week and a fortnight respectively. Into these the\r\nrations were carefully distributed, butter in the centre, whole biscuits\r\nnear the top. Then the tanks were tightly closed, and one man operated\r\nwith palm and sail-needle, sewing them up with twine. At the same time,\r\na side-line was run in pemmican which was removed semi-frozen from the\r\nair-tight tins, and shaved into small pieces with a strong sheath-knife.\r\nButter, too, arrived from the refrigerator-store and was subdivided into\r\ntwo-ounce or pound lumps.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other occupations were in full swing. An amateur cobbler,\r\nhis crampon on a last, studded its spiked surface with clouts, hammering\r\naway in complete disregard of the night-watchman's uneasy slumbers. The\r\nbig sewing-machine raced at top-speed round the flounce of a tent, and\r\nin odd corners among the bunks were groups mending mitts, strengthening\r\nsleeping-bags and patching burberrys. The cartographer at his table\r\nbeneath a shaded acetylene light drew maps and sketched, the magnetician\r\nwas busy on calculations close by. The cook and messman often made their\r\npresence felt and heard. In the outer Hut, the lathe spun round, its\r\nwhirr and click drowned in the noisy rasp of the grinder and the blast\r\nof the big blow-lamp. The last-named, Bickerton, \"bus-driver\" and\r\nair-tractor expert, had converted, with the aid of a few pieces of\r\ncovering tin, into a forge. A piece of red-hot metal was lifted out and\r\nthrust into the vice; Hannam was striker and Bickerton holder. General\r\nconversation was conducted in shouts, Hannam's being easily predominant.\r\n\r\nThe sum total of sounds was sufficient for a while to make every one\r\noblivious to the clamour of the restless wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI SPRING EXPLOITS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the \"winter calms\" were a delusion, there were at least several\r\nbeautifully clear, moderately calm days in June. The expectation of\r\ncolder weather had been realized, and by the end of the month it was a\r\nperceptible fact that the sun had definitely turned, describing a\r\nlonger arc when skimming the distant fleets of bergs along the northern\r\nhorizon. Thus on June 28 the refracted image of the sun rose into\r\nvisibility about eleven o'clock, heralded by a vivid green sky and\r\ndamask cloud and by one o'clock had disappeared.\r\n\r\nOn the same day every one was abroad, advancing the wireless masts\r\nanother stage and digging ice-shafts. Stillwell commenced a contoured\r\nplane-table survey of the neighbourhood of Winter Quarters. He continued\r\nthis with many breaks during the next few months and eventually\r\ncompleted an accurate and valuable map, undeterred by the usual series\r\nof frost-bites.\r\n\r\nThere was much anticipated of July, but the wind soughed on and the\r\ntemperature decreased. Just to demonstrate its resource, the wind\r\nmaintained ninety-seven miles per hour for six hours on July 19, while\r\nthe puff-anemometer indicated several \"breaks\" of one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles per hour.\r\n\r\nJuly 21 was cold, calm and clear. For the first time after many weeks\r\nthe sun was mildly warm, and all felt with a spring of optimism that\r\na new era had begun. The sea which had been kept open by the wind was\r\nimmediately overspread with thin, dark ice, which in a few hours was\r\ndotted with many ice-flowers aggregates of fern-like, sprouting fronds\r\nsimilar to small bouquets or rosettes. Soon the surface had whitened and\r\nthickened and by next morning was firm enough to hold a man out beyond\r\nthe nearest island. The wind did not allow this state of affairs to last\r\nfor long, for by lunch-time it had hurried away the wide floes and raged\r\nacross a foaming sea.\r\n\r\nWe still considered the question of sledging, and I decided that if\r\nthere were the slightest prospect of accomplishing anything, several\r\nof us would start before the end of July on a short journey. The month,\r\nhowever, closed with nothing to commend it. The night-watchman for July\r\n29 says:\r\n\r\n\"The moon was wonderfully bright to-night, encircled by a complete halo.\r\nIt appeared to hang suspended like a silver globe in the dark blue sky.\r\nThe stars flash and sparkle and seem much nearer here than in Australia.\r\nAt midnight the wind blew at ninety miles per hour, so that it was no\r\neasy job getting to the screen in slippery finnesko. Away in the north\r\nthere was a dense cloud of spray and sea-smoke, and the wind screamed\r\npast the Hut. The 'St. Elmoscope' was buzzing merrily in the roof all\r\nthe time.\"\r\n\r\nNinnis and Mertz with a team of dogs managed, on the morning of the\r\n29th, to get several loads of forty pounds over the first steep rise\r\nof the glacier to Webb's magnetic ice-cave against a \"blow\" of seventy\r\nmiles per hour.\r\n\r\nAugust 1 was marked by a hurricane, and the celebration in the evening\r\nof Swiss Confederation Day. Mertz was the hero of the occasion as well\r\nas cook and master of ceremonies. From a mysterious box he produced all\r\nkinds of quaint conserves, and the menu soared to unknown delicacies\r\nlike \"Potage a la Suisse, Choucroute garnie aux saucission de Berne,\r\nPuree de foie gras trufee, and Leckerley de Bale.\" Hanging above the\r\nbuoyant assembly were the Cross of Helvetia and the Jack of Britannia.\r\n\r\nIt was not till August 8 that there was any indication of improvement.\r\nThe sun was bright, the barometer was steady, the wind fell to forty\r\nmiles an hour and a fine radiant of cirrus cloud spread out fan-like\r\nfrom the north; the first from that direction for months.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of August 9, Ninnis, Madigan and I set off with a team\r\nof dogs against a forty-mile wind in an attempt to push to the south.\r\nDarkness was coming on when we sighted a bamboo pole, three and a\r\nquarter miles south of the Hut, and camped. The dogs pulled well up the\r\nsteep slopes, but the feet of several were cut by the sharp edges of the\r\nwind-worn ice.\r\n\r\nVery heavy gusts swept by in the early morning hours of the 10th. and\r\nwhen the time came to get out of our sleeping-bags it fell calm for a\r\nshort space. We had taken down the tent and had started to move away,\r\nwhen back rushed the wind, strong and steady. Still we pushed on with\r\nour willing team and by a piece of good fortune reached the sledge which\r\nhad been abandoned in the autumn, five and a half miles from the Hut,\r\nand of whose fate in the winter's hurricanes we had made all kind of\r\nconjectures.\r\n\r\nOn its leeward side there was a ramp of very hard snow slanting down\r\nfrom the top of the sledge. To windward the low pedestal of ice on\r\nwhich the runners stood was hollowed out, and the wood of the rails and\r\ncross-bars, the leather straps, tent, floor-cloth and canvas food-tanks\r\nwere all bleached and worn. The aluminium cooker, strapped on its box,\r\nwas brightly polished on the weather side by the dry, drifting snow\r\nimpelled by the furious winds. A thermograph, left behind in the autumn,\r\nwas found to be intact and indicated a temperature of -35 degrees\r\nF.--the lowest for the eight days during which it had run. The remains\r\nof Madigan's plum-pudding of the autumn were unearthed and found in\r\nsplendid condition. That evening it was thawed out over the primus and\r\nwe demolished it, after a pause of over five months since having the\r\nfirst cut.\r\n\r\nAt this spot the steepest grades of the ascent to the plateau were left\r\nbehind, and it appeared to be a strategic point from which to extend our\r\nsledging efforts. The main difficulty was that of pitching camp in\r\nthe prevailing winds on a surface of ice. To obviate this, the only\r\nexpedient was to excavate a shelter beneath the ice itself; and there\r\nwas the further consideration that all sledging parties would be able to\r\nmake use of such a haven and save extra wear on their tents.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 11 Madigan and Ninnis commenced to sink a deep\r\nvertical trench, at one end of which a room was hewn out large enough to\r\naccommodate three men. The job was finished on the following day, and we\r\nstruck the tent and moved to our new abode. The tent was spread over the\r\nvertical shaft which served as the entrance.\r\n\r\nIt was a great relief to be in a strong room, with solid walls of ice,\r\nin place of the cramped tent flapping violently in the wind. Inside, the\r\nsilence was profound; the blizzard was banished. Aladdin's Cave it\r\nwas dubbed--a truly magical world of glassy facets and scintillating\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\nShelves were chipped out at a moment's notice for primus stove, spirit\r\nbottle, matches, kerosene and other oddments. At one side a small hole\r\nwas cut to communicate with a narrow fissure which provided ventilation\r\nwithout allowing the entrance of drift snow. Whatever daylight there was\r\nfiltered through the roof and walls without hindrance. A small crevasse\r\nopened near at hand and was a natural receptacle for rubbish. The purest\r\nice for cooking could be immediately hacked from the walls without the\r\ninconvenience of having to don one's burberrys and go outside for it.\r\nFinally, one neatly disposed of spare clothes by moistening the corner\r\nof each garment and pressing it against the wall for a few seconds,\r\nwhere it would remain hanging until required. The place, in fact, was\r\nsimply replete with conveniences. We thoroughly enjoyed the night's\r\nrest in Aladdin's Cave, notwithstanding alarming cracks proceeding\r\noccasionally from the crevasses around.\r\n\r\nMadigan and Ninnis dug a shelter for the dogs, which spent their time\r\ncurled up so as to expose as little surface as possible to the biting\r\nwind. Their thick coats did not adhere to a snow surface, but readily\r\nbecame frozen down to ice, so that an ice-axe would have to be used to\r\nchip them free.\r\n\r\nOn August 13, though there was a steady, strong wind blowing, we\r\ncontinued our advance to the south. The dogs hated to face wind, but, on\r\nthe whole, did better than expected. In the afternoon, when only eight\r\nmiles south of Winter Quarters and at an altitude of two thousand feet,\r\ndark and lowering clouds formed overhead, and I decided to give up any\r\nidea of going farther out, for the time being. We had provisions for\r\na few days only, and there was every indication of thick, drifting\r\nweather, during which, in the crevassed ice of that vicinity, it would\r\nnot be advisable to travel.\r\n\r\nAfter depoting a pick, shovel and some pemmican, we started back,\r\nthinking it might be possible to reach the Hut the same night. However,\r\ndriven by a strong wind over a polished, slippery surface split into\r\nsmall crevasses, down a grade which steepened quickly, we required to\r\nhave all our senses vigilant. Two of the dogs remained in harness and\r\nthe rest were allowed to run loose ahead. These two strained every\r\neffort to catch up to their companions.\r\n\r\nWe retarded the sledge as much as possible and all went well for a\r\nfew minutes. Then the wind slewed the sledge, the runners struck an\r\nirregularity in the surface and the whole capsized. This happened\r\nrepeatedly, until there was nothing to do but loose the two remaining\r\ndogs and drag the sledge ourselves. The dogs were soon lost to sight,\r\nexcept Pavlova, who remained with us all the time. As the hours of\r\nlight were short in August, darkness had come before Aladdin's Cave was\r\nreached, and it was with some relief that we saw the sledge, flag-pole\r\nand the expectant dogs suddenly loom up in front. The sleeping-bags and\r\nother gear were passed down into the Cave and the dogs were fed.\r\n\r\nWhen the doorway was opened in the morning, August 14, a blizzard with\r\ndense drifting snow was in full progress. As it was not possible to see\r\nany distance, and as our quarters were very comfortable, we decided to\r\nwait for another day. Madigan and Ninnis went out and fed the dogs, who\r\nwere all snugly curled up in beds of snow.\r\n\r\nThe weather was no better on the 15th, but, as we were only five and a\r\nhalf miles from the Hut, which was more comfortable and where there was\r\nmuch work to be done, it seemed a shame to remain cooped up in idleness.\r\nMadigan and Ninnis were both strongly in favour of making a dash for the\r\nHut, so we set off.\r\n\r\nThe sledge having been dug out, one man went in front to keep the course\r\nand two men brought up the rear, holding back the load. With long-spiked\r\nSwiss crampons we could hold up very well on the ice. In dense drift it\r\nwas not a simple matter to steer a correct course for the Hut and it was\r\nessential not to deviate, as the rocky foreshores near which it stood\r\nextended only for a mile east and west; on either side abutting on\r\nvertical ice-cliffs. With a compelling force like a prance at our backs,\r\nit was not a nice thing to contemplate finding ourselves on the brink of\r\na precipice.\r\n\r\nThe wind, however, was steady, and we knew at what angle to steer\r\nto keep a rough course; and we were also helped by a number of\r\nsmall crevasses between three and five and a half miles which ran\r\napproximately north and south.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile had been covered before we remarked the absence of the dogs\r\nwhich had been left to follow. We had taken for granted that they would\r\nfollow us, and were so fully occupied after starting that their absence\r\nhad passed unnoticed. It would be difficult to locate them if we\r\nreturned; the weather would improve in a few days; if they felt hungry\r\nthey would come down of their own accord. So we decided to go on without\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt two miles from the Hut the drift thinned out and the wind became more\r\ngusty. Between the gusts the view ahead opened out for a considerable\r\ndistance, and the rocks soon showed black below the last steep fall.\r\n\r\nBack at the Hut it was arranged that if the dogs did not return in a\r\nreasonable time, Bage, Mertz and Hurley should go up to Aladdin's Cave\r\nin search of them.\r\n\r\nThey made a great effort to get away next morning. The sledge was hauled\r\nfor one thousand one hundred yards up to the magnetic ice-cave against a\r\nbitter torrent of air rushing by at eighty-two miles an hour. Here they\r\nretreated exhausted.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th the wind was gauged at eighty-four miles an hour, and\r\nnothing could be done. Dense drift and ferocious wind continued until\r\nthe morning of August 21, and still none of the dogs had come home.\r\n\r\nBage, Hurley and Mertz took advantage of a slight lull to start off at\r\n6.30 A.M. As they did not return that night we presumed they were making\r\ngood headway.\r\n\r\nThe drift was thick and the wind high for four days, and it was not\r\nuntil the morning of the 25th that the weather showed clearer and more\r\npromising. At 2 P.M. Bage and his companions arrived at the Hut bringing\r\nall the dogs except Grandmother, who had died of exhaustion. Aladdin's\r\nCave had been difficult to find in the driving snow, which had thickened\r\nafter the first few miles. They actually passed close to it when Mertz,\r\nbetween the gusts, sighted Castor jumping about, fully alive to the\r\napproaching relief. The other dogs were found curled up in the snow, in\r\na listless, apathetic state; apparently in the same positions when left\r\nseven days before. They had made no attempt to break into several bags\r\nof provisions lying close at hand, preferring to starve rather than\r\nexpose their faces to the pelting drift. All were frozen down except\r\nBasilisk and Castor. Pavlova was in the best condition, possibly because\r\nher last meal had been an extra full one; a reward for remaining with us\r\nwhen the others had bolted. Grandmother was in the worst condition,\r\nand, despite all efforts at revival, died four hours after. As the poor\r\nbrutes were very weak after their long fast and exposure, they were\r\ntaken into the Cave and fed on warm hoosh. Everything possible was done\r\nfor them, and in return the party passed a very miserable time cramped\r\nin such a small space with six dogs. The accommodation was slightly\r\nincreased by enlarging the Cave.\r\n\r\nFive days of calm weather! It could scarcely be credited, yet September\r\ncame with such a spell. They gave us great opportunities, and, for once,\r\na vision of what perfect Antarctic days might be. The sea speedily froze\r\nover and extended our territory to the north. Every day we dredged among\r\nthe tide-cracks, until Hunter and Laseron had material enough to sort\r\nand bottle for weeks. Seals came up everywhere, and the dogs gorged on\r\nmuch-needed meat and blubber. Three large Weddells were shot near the\r\n\"Eastern Barrier\" on September 1, and hauled up an ice-cliff eighty feet\r\nhigh to the rocks above. Work on the wireless masts went on apace, and\r\nthe geologist was abroad with his plane-table every day. Webb and Bage,\r\nafter a protracted interval, were able to take star observations for\r\ntime, in order to check the chronometers.\r\n\r\nMertz, Ninnis, Whetter and Laseron, with a team of dogs sledged a big\r\nload of food-stuffs to Aladdin's Cave on September 1. At the Cave the\r\ndogs were let loose, but instead of running back to the Hut, lingered\r\nabout and finally had to be led down the slope. On being loosed again,\r\nseveral rushed back to the Cave and were only brought along by force.\r\nThat night, Scott and Franklin, two kindred spirits, were not present at\r\n\"roll-call\".\r\n\r\nOn September 3, McLean, Whetter and Close took more provisions to\r\nAladdin's Cave. They reported light drift and wind on the highlands,\r\nwhile at sea-level it was clear and calm.\r\n\r\nThe sea-ice was by then thick and safe. About half a mile off shore a\r\nvery successful dredging was made in fifty fathoms; the bottom at this\r\ndepth simply teemed with life. At first, the dredge, rope-coils, tub,\r\npicks and other necessary implements were dragged about on a sledge, but\r\nthe sledge was hauled only with great difficulty and much exertion over\r\nthe sticky, new sea-ice. As a substitute a portable, steel handcart was\r\nadvantageously employed, although, owing to its weight, tide-cracks\r\nand rotten areas had to be crossed at a run. On one occasion a flimsy\r\nsurface collapsed under it, and Hunter had a wetting before it was\r\nhauled on to firmer ice.\r\n\r\nOn September 4 there was a cloud radiant from the northwest, indicative\r\nof a change in the weather. Ninnis, Mertz and Murphy transported more\r\nfood-bags and kerosene to Aladdin's Cave. They found Franklin one and a\r\nhalf miles south of the Hut lying on the ice quite well, but there was\r\nno sign of Scott. Both dogs were seen on the 1st of the month, when they\r\nwere in a locality south-east of the Hut, where crevasses were numerous.\r\nIt seemed most probable that Scott had lost his life in one of them. The\r\nparty visiting the Cave reported a considerable amount of snow drifting\r\nabove a level of one thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThere was another day of successful dredging, and, about four o'clock,\r\nwhile several men were still out on the ice, whirlies with great columns\r\nof drift came steadily down the glacier, pouring over the seaward\r\ncliffs. In a few minutes the snow-clouds were round the Hut and the wind\r\nwas not long in working up to eighty miles per hour. The dredging party\r\nreached the land just in time; and the sea-ice drifted away to the\r\nnorth. Thus ended one of the most remarkable periods of fine weather\r\nexperienced by us in Adelie Land, only to be excelled in the height of\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of such a spell being repeated fired us with the hope\r\nthat after all a reasonable amount of sledging could be accomplished\r\nin the spring. Three parties were chosen to reconnoitre in different\r\ndirections and to test the sledging gear. As we were far from being\r\nconfident in the weather, I made it clear that no party should penetrate\r\nfarther than fifty miles from the Hut, nor remain away longer than a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nWebb, McLean and Stillwell, the southern reconnoitring party, were the\r\nfirst to set off, leaving on September 7 against a wind of fifty-six\r\nmiles per hour. Between them they had only one pair of good spiked\r\ncrampons, and it was a hard, five hours' drag up to Aladdin's Cave. A\r\ntent which had been spread over the entrance to keep out snow was picked\r\nup here. It had suffered punctures and small tears from crampons, and,\r\nas the next day was one of boisterous wind, the party spent it repairing\r\nthe tent and endeavouring to take magnetic observations. The latter had\r\nto be abandoned owing to the instrument becoming iced up.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon the wind fell to the forties, and the party struggled\r\non to the south for three miles two hundred yards and camped, as it was\r\nnecessary to make a search for a small depot of pemmican tins, a pick\r\nand a shovel left by us in the vicinity in August. The drift cleared\r\nat noon on the 11th, and the bamboo pole marking the depot appeared\r\na quarter of a mile away on the right. The pick, shovel and flag were\r\nsecured and another afternoon's march against a fifty-mile wind with\r\na temperature at -20 degrees F. brought the party three and a quarter\r\nmiles further, to a point eleven and three-quarter miles south of the\r\nHut. The wind rose to the eighties during the night, and there were\r\nmany small holes in the tent which provided more ventilation than was\r\nagreeable. As the wind was too strong for travelling on the 12th, it was\r\ndecided to make a cave in case of accident to the tent.\r\n\r\nA tunnel was driven into the sloping surface of the ice towards a\r\ncrevasse about a foot wide. It was a good ten hours' job in tough ice\r\nbefore the crevasse was reached. Into the fissure all the hewn ice was\r\nthrown instead of being laboriously shovelled up through the tunnel. The\r\n\"Cathedral Grotto\" was soon finished, the tent was struck and the party\r\nmade themselves comfortable inside. The cavern was found to be a very\r\ndraughty place with a crevasse along one wall, and it was difficult to\r\nkeep warm in one-man sleeping-bags. The crevasse was accordingly closed\r\nwith ice and snow. That evening and on several subsequent occasions\r\nMcLean took blood-pressure observations.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three days the wind was so strong that Webb's were the\r\nonly crampons in which any efficient marching could be done. The time\r\nwas spent in building a high break-wind of ice-blocks, a pit being\r\nexcavated on the windward side in which Webb took a full set of magnetic\r\nobservations. Within the \"Grotto\" the instrument rapidly became coated\r\nwith ice-crystals; in the open air this difficulty did not arise, but\r\nothers had to be overcome. It was exceedingly cold work at -20 degrees\r\nF. in a sixty-mile wind, both for Webb and his recorder Stillwell.\r\n\r\nThere seemed no hope of going forward, so the depot flag was hoisted\r\nand a fortnight's provisions and kerosene stowed in the lee of the\r\nbreak-wind. It was a furious race back to the Hut via Aladdin's Cave\r\nwith a gusty, seventy-five-mile wind in the rear. McLean and Stillwell\r\nactually skied along on their short blunt crampons, while Webb did his\r\nbest to brake behind.\r\n\r\nThe second party comprised Ninnis, Mertz, and Murphy, who went to the\r\nsouth-east, leaving on September 11. After a hard fight to Aladdin's\r\nCave, the wind approaching fifty miles an hour, they diverged to the\r\nsouth-east. On the 12th they made steady progress up the slope of the\r\nglacier, delayed by many small crevasses. The surface was so rough that\r\nthe nuts on the sledge-meter soon became loose and it was necessary to\r\nstop every quarter of a mile to adjust them. The day's march was a solid\r\nfive and three quarter miles against a fifty-mile wind.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th Ninnis's record proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The sky was still clear but the wind had increased to sixty-five miles\r\nper hour, the temperature standing at -17 degrees F.\r\n\r\n\"We kept on the same course; the glacier's slope being steeper.\r\nMertz was as usual wearing leather boots and mountaineering crampons,\r\notherwise progress would have been practically impossible; the finnesko\r\ncrampons worn by Murphy and myself giving very little foothold.\r\nTravelling was very slow indeed, and when we camped at 4 P.M., two and a\r\nhalf miles was all that had been covered.\r\n\r\n\"At 9.15 A.M. (September 14) the wind practically dropped, and we\r\nadvanced under perfect conditions.\"\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far, however, before the wind suddenly increased so\r\nthat only about four and a half miles were completed in the day. That\r\nevening, curiously enough, it fell calm for a time; then there was a\r\nperiod of alternating violent winds and calm.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, September 15, it was impossible for them to move, as a\r\nhurricane raged outside. The tent was very much damaged by the wind, but\r\nin that state it managed to stand up till next morning. In the\r\nmeantime all three fully dressed themselves and lay in their three-man\r\nsleeping-bag ready to take to the road at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at a distance of eighteen miles southeast of the\r\nHut, there was nothing for it but to make for Aladdin's Cave, which was\r\nsafely reached by a forced march of twelve and three-quarter miles, with\r\na furious wind partly abeam. On the way the sledge was blown sideways\r\non to the lids of many wide crevasses, which, fortunately for the party,\r\nwere strong at that season of the year.\r\n\r\nFrom the realistic reports of the two parties which had returned it was\r\nevident that Madigan and his companions, Close and Whetter who had set\r\nout on the 12th to the west were having a bad time. But it was not till\r\nthe 23rd, after a week of clear skies, low temperatures and unceasing\r\ndrift-free wind that we began to feel apprehensive about them.\r\n\r\nSeptember 24 and 25 were punctuated by several intervals of calm during\r\nwhich it was judged the party would have been able to travel.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of September 26 Ninnis and Mertz, with a team of dogs,\r\nset off up the hill to Aladdin's Cave to deposit some provisions and to\r\nscan the horizon for any sign of the sledgers. On the way they fell in\r\nwith them descending the slopes, very worn and frost-bitten.\r\n\r\nThey had a thrilling story to tell, and, when it was known that the\r\nparty had reached fifty miles to the west, everybody crowded round to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\nThe wind average at the Hut during their fortnight of absence was\r\nfifty-eight miles per hour, implying worse conditions on the plateau.\r\nMadigan gave the facts:\r\n\r\n\"After leaving Aladdin's Cave on the 12th we continued due south,\r\nlunching at 2 P.M. on the site of Webb's first camp. Our troubles had\r\nalready begun; the wind averaging sixty miles an hour all day with a\r\ntemperature at noon of -14 degrees F.\r\n\r\n\"As a few tears appeared in the tent during the night, we saw that it\r\nwould not be advisable to put it up next day for lunch, so we had a\r\ncold meal, crouched in the lee of the sledge. This custom was found\r\nto economize time, as we became so cold eating our fare of biscuit,\r\nchocolate and butter that we got moving again as soon as possible.\r\nThe great disadvantage was that there was nothing to drink between the\r\nmorning and evening meals.\r\n\r\n\"We sewed up the rents in the tent during the halt, having to use bare\r\nfingers in the open. About four stitches at a time were as much as one\r\nman could manage, and then the other two took their turns.\r\n\r\n\"The next day was the only comparatively calm period of the two weeks of\r\ntravelling. The wind was in the vicinity of thirty miles per hour, and,\r\ngoing west, we reached a spot, twenty miles 'out,' on a snow-covered\r\nsurface, by nightfall.\r\n\r\n\"A steady seventy-five-mile wind blew all day on the 15th at right\r\nangles to our course, accompanied by a thick, low drift. The surface was\r\npartially consolidated snow, very hard and smooth. Sometimes the sledge\r\nwould grip and we could pull straight ahead. Then, suddenly, it would\r\nslide away sideways down wind and often pull us off our feet with\r\na sudden vicious jerk. Most of the time we were dragging in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction to make the sledge run west, stumbling through\r\nthe drift with the sledge now behind us, now sliding away to leeward,\r\noften capsizing and requiring to be laboriously righted and sometimes\r\nrepacked.\r\n\r\n\"After many experiments, we found the best device was to have two men\r\non the bow-rope, about twenty feet long, and one with about ten feet\r\nof rope attached to the rear of the sledge. The man on the tail-rope,\r\nusually Whetter, found it very difficult to keep his feet, and, after a\r\nscore of falls in stinging drift with incidental frost-bites on fingers\r\nand cheeks, he did not feel exactly cheerful.\r\n\r\n\"By 4 P.M. on the 15th we had reached twenty-five miles and were\r\nexhausted. We pitched camp at an early hour, partly influenced by the\r\nfact that it was a special occasion--Close's birthday! Some port wine\r\nhad been slipped in to provide against that 'emergency.' On taking the\r\nprecious bottle from the instrument-box, I found that the cork was out,\r\nand, for one awful moment, thought the bottle was empty. Then I realized\r\nthat the wine had frozen solid and had pushed the cork out by its\r\nexpansion on solidification.\r\n\r\n\"At last, the tent safely pitched and hoosh and cocoa finished, the\r\nmoment came to drink to Close's health and happiness. The bottle had\r\nstood on the top of the cooker while the meal was being prepared, but\r\nthe wine was still as solid as ever. After being shaken and held over\r\nthe primus for a good half-hour it began to issue in lumps. Once the\r\nlumps were secured in mugs the rest of the thawing was easy. Finally, we\r\ntoasted Close and his wife (in far Australia) in what we voted to be\r\nthe finest draught it had ever been our good fortune to drink. In the\r\nmorning a cairn was made of the snow-blocks which were taken from\r\nthe tent-skirt, and it was surmounted with the bottle, being called\r\n'Birthday Camp.'\r\n\r\n\"During September 16 my right eyelid became frostbitten. I noticed that\r\nit was hard and refused to shut, so I rubbed vigorously to bring it\r\nround. However, it swelled and blistered badly and the eye remained\r\nclosed for two days.\r\n\r\n\"From twenty to fifty miles 'out', the surface was neve with areas\r\nof sastrugi up to three feet in height. No crevasses were noticed. At\r\ntwenty-eight miles out, we lost sight of the sea, and at forty miles an\r\naltitude of four thousand five hundred feet was reached.\r\n\r\n\"We turned out at 6 A.M. every morning and were on the move by 9 A.M.\r\nLunch only took half an hour and was a most uncomfortable meal. As we\r\nsat in the lee of the sledge, the surface-drift swirled up in our\r\nfaces like fine sand. We never camped before 6 P.M. and were obliged to\r\nconsider five miles a good day's run.\r\n\r\n\"Pitching camp took nearly an hour. Blocks of snow were cut and arranged\r\nin a semicircle, within which the tent was laid with its peak upwind. It\r\nsounds simple enough, but, as we had to take off crampons so as not to\r\ntread on the tent, our difficulties were enormously increased by having\r\nto move about wearing finnesko on a smooth surface in a high wind. One\r\nman crawled into the tent, and, at a given signal, the other two raised\r\nthe peak while the former held on to the upwind leg and kicked the other\r\nlegs into place with his feet. The others then quickly piled food-tanks\r\nand blocks of snow on to the skirt, calling out as soon as there was\r\nenough to hold it down, as the man gripping the bamboo leg inside would\r\nsoon have 'deadly cold' fingers. It was always a great relief when the\r\ntent was up.\r\n\r\n\"Almost every night there was some sewing to do, and it was not long\r\nbefore every one's fingers were in a bad state. They became, especially\r\nnear the tips, as hard as wood and devoid of sensation. Manipulating\r\ntoggles and buttons on one's clothing gave an immense amount of trouble,\r\nand it always seemed an interminable time before we got away in the\r\nmorning. Our lowest temperature was -35 degrees F., early on September\r\n18.\r\n\r\n\"We were fifty miles 'out' on September 19 on a white, featureless\r\nplain. Through low drift we had seen very little of our surroundings\r\non the march. A bamboo pole with a black flag was raised, a mound was\r\nbuilt, and a week's provisions for three men and two gallons of kerosene\r\nwere cached.\r\n\r\n\"In the morning there was a howling eighty-mile blizzard with dense\r\ndrift, and our hopes of an early start homeward were dispelled. We\r\nfeared for the safety of the tent, knowing that if it had gone during\r\nthat 'blow' our hopes of getting back to the Hut would have been small.\r\n\r\n\"The wind continued all day and the next night, but, to our joy, abated\r\non the 21st to fifty miles an hour, permitting us to travel.\r\n\r\n\"Through a seventy-five-miler on the 22nd and a quieter day on the 23rd,\r\nwe picked up our half-way mound at Birthday Camp on September 24. On\r\nthe same night the long-suffering sledge-meter, much battered, gave up\r\nrecording.\r\n\r\n\"At 3 A.M. I was awakened by something striking me on the head. I looked\r\nout of the sleeping-bag and found that the tent had fallen in on us. The\r\nlashing at the apex had carried away and the poles upwind were almost\r\nflat. The cap was gone, and one side of the tent was split from top to\r\nbottom. I awakened the others, and Whetter and I got out, leaving Close\r\ninside to hang on to the bag. Luckily we had kept on our burberrys in\r\ncase of accidents. For once the entrance had not to be unfastened, as\r\nthere was a ready-made exit. The poles were roughly bound together\r\nwith an alpine rope and anchored to a pick on the windward side. It was\r\nblowing about eighty miles an hour, but fortunately there was no drift.\r\nWhen daylight came the tent was found to be hopelessly ruined, and\r\nto light the primus was impossible, though the wind had abated to\r\nthirty-five miles an hour.\r\n\r\n\"We ate some frozen food and pushed on, hoping to find Aladdin's Cave\r\nbefore dark, so that we should not have to spend a night without a tent.\r\nAfter a struggle of thirteen miles over rough ice we came, footsore and\r\nworn out, to Aladdin's Cave. Close's feet were badly blistered, and both\r\nmy big toes had become frost-bitten at the fifty-mile camp, giving me a\r\ngood deal of trouble on the way back.\r\n\r\n\"Never was the Cave a more luxurious place. The cooker was kept busy far\r\ninto the night, while we drank and smoked and felt happy.\"\r\n\r\nThe successful conclusion of this journey in the face of the most\r\nadverse weather conditions was something upon which Madigan, Whetter and\r\nClose could well feel proud, for in its way it must be a record in the\r\nsledging world. They were indeed badly frost-bitten; Madigan's great\r\ntoes having suffered most of all. Whetter's chief injury was a wound\r\nunder the chin occasioned by a pair of scissors handled by Madigan to\r\nfree Whetter's helmet on an occasion when it was firmly frozen to his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, Mertz, Hurley and Ninnis made a gallant attempt to rescue\r\ntwo dogs, Basilisk and Franklin, which had remained at Aladdin's Cave on\r\nSeptember 26, after accompanying them there with a load of provisions.\r\nAt the Hut there was no drift, but during the ascent it became thicker,\r\nand the wind stronger, forcing them at last to turn back.\r\n\r\nTwo days later another attempt was made by Ninnis and Mertz, and, in\r\ndense drift, after wandering about for a long time they happened on the\r\nCave, to find that the dogs were not there, though spots were discovered\r\nwhere they had evidently been sleeping in the snow. Coming back\r\ndisconsolately, they found that the dogs had reached the Hut not long\r\nbefore them. Apparently the two vagrants, hearing Ninnis and Mertz\r\nblundering about in the drift in search of the depot, had decided\r\nthat it was time to return home. We concluded that the ways of these\r\nGreenland dogs were past finding out.\r\n\r\nOctober came with a deluge of snow and transient hours of bright\r\nsunlight, during which the seals would make a temporary landing and\r\nretire again to the water when their endurance was exhausted. Snow\r\npetrels flew in great numbers about the rocks in the evening, seeking\r\nout their old nest-crevices. Seeing these signs of returning life, every\r\none was in great expectation of the arrival of the penguins.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 11th, Hurley, Laseron, Hunter and Correll made an\r\ninnovation by presenting a small farce to an audience which had been\r\nstarved of dramatic entertainment for a long time, and consequently\r\nshowed tremendous appreciation.\r\n\r\nThe first penguin came waddling up the ice-foot against a seventy-mile\r\nwind late on the afternoon of October 12. McLean brought the bird back\r\nto the Hut and the newcomer received a great ovation. Stimulated by\r\ntheir success on the previous night and the appearance of the first\r\npenguin, the theatrical company added to their number, and, dispensing\r\nwith a rehearsal, produced an opera, \"The Washerwoman's Secret\"\r\n(Laseron). Part of the Hut was curtained off as a combined green-room\r\nand dressing-room; the kitchen was the stage; footlights twinkled on the\r\nfloor; the acetylene limelight beamed down from the rafters, while the\r\naudience crowded on a form behind the dining-table, making tactless\r\nremarks and steadily eating chocolate.\r\n\r\nThe typed programmes advertised the following:\r\n\r\nTHE WASHERWOMAN'S SECRET\r\n\r\n(Opera in Five Acts)\r\n\r\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\n  DR.

We were all seated at dinner and\r\nthe Hut was quivering in the tornado-like gusts which followed a heavy\r\n\"blow\" reaching a maximum hourly average of ninety-one miles. One mighty\r\nblast was followed by a crack and the sound of a heavy falling body. For\r\na moment it was thought that something had happened to the Hut. Then the\r\nmessman ran out to the trap-door and saw that the northern wireless mast\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe weather showed but meagre signs of improvement, but the penguins\r\ncame up in great numbers. They were in groups all along the ice-foot\r\nin the lee of rocks and icy pinnacles. They climbed up to their old\r\nresorts, and in a few days commenced to build nests of small pebbles.\r\nSkua gulls mysteriously appeared, snow petrels hovered along the rocky\r\nridges and odd seals landed on the wind-raked harbour ice. Silver-grey\r\nand Antarctic petrels flew along the shore with occasional Cape pigeons.\r\nIf the weather were indifferent to the fact, the birds did not forget\r\nthat spring had come.\r\n\r\nA Weddell seal calved on the bay-ice on October 18. For a week the pup\r\nhad a miserable time in winds ranging mostly about the seventies, with\r\nthe temperature below zero Fahrenheit. At last it became so weak that\r\nit thawed a hole in the soft, sludgy ice and could not extricate itself.\r\nBoth it and the mother were killed and skinned for the biological\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nOn all but the worst days a gang of men worked with picks and shovels\r\ndigging out the Hangar, so that Bickerton could test the air-tractor\r\nsledge. The attack was concentrated upon a solid bank of snow and ice\r\ninto which heaps of tins and rubbish had been compactly frozen. In soft\r\nsnow enormous headway can be made in a short space of time, but in that\r\nspecies of conglomerate, progress is slow. Eventually, a cutting was\r\nmade by which the machine could pass out. The rampart of snow was broken\r\nthrough at the northern end of the Hangar, and the sledge with its long\r\ncurved runners was hauled forth triumphantly on the 25th. From that\r\ntime onwards Bickerton continued to experiment and to improve the\r\ncontrivance.\r\n\r\nOn October 21 there was a marked thaw inside the Hut. The frost\r\nalong all the cracks dissolved into water and ran down the walls over\r\npictures, on to book-shelves and bunks. The thick caking of ice on the\r\nwindows dripped continually, coming away in layers at lunch-time and\r\nscattering among the diners at both ends of the table. Every available\r\nbucket and tub was in use, and small tin-gutters hooked under each\r\nwindow had to be emptied at frequent intervals.\r\n\r\nStillwell came in during the afternoon bearing an albino penguin with\r\na prettily mottled head; a curious freak of which the biologists\r\nimmediately took possession. The penguins now swarmed along the\r\nforeshores, those not settling down in the rookeries wandering about\r\nin small crowds, occasionally visiting the Hut and exploring among the\r\nrocks or up the slippery glacier. Murphy was heard, at this time, to\r\nadvance a theory accounting for the fact that Adelie penguins never made\r\ntheir nests on a scale more elaborate than a collection of stones.\r\nHe submitted that anything else would be blown away. To support the\r\ncontention, he stated that as soon as the female lays her egg, she\r\nplaces a stone on top to weight it down. The biologists kept a dignified\r\nsilence during the discussion.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st an Emperor penguin landed on the harbour ice, and, early in\r\nNovember, two more were captured. These imperial birds are very rare\r\non the coasts of Adelie Land, owing to the fact that their winter\r\nbreeding-grounds in Antarctica are selected in spots where climatic\r\nconditions are comparatively good.\r\n\r\nOctober closed with an average wind velocity of 56.9 miles per hour.\r\nYet the possibility of summer sledging was no longer remote. The sun\r\nwas high, spells of calm were longer and more frequent, and, with the\r\ncertain knowledge that we should be on the plateau in November, the\r\nsledging parties were chosen, schemes of exploration were discussed, and\r\nthe last details for an extensive campaign completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII ACROSS KING GEORGE V LAND\r\n\r\n\r\n    We yearned beyond the skyline.--Kipling\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober had passed without offering any opportunities for sledging, and\r\nwe resolved that in defiance of all but the worst weather a start would\r\nbe made in November. The 'Aurora' was due to arrive early in January\r\n1913 and the time at our disposal for exploration was slipping away\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nThe investigation by sledging journeys of the coastline to the eastward\r\nwas regarded as of prime importance, for our experience in the 'Aurora'\r\nwhen in those longitudes during the previous year was such as to give\r\nlittle promise of its ever being accomplished from the sea.\r\n\r\nWestward, the coast was accessible from the sea; at least for some\r\ndistance in that direction. Madigan's journey in the springtime had\r\ndemonstrated that, if anything, the land to the west was steeper, and\r\nconsequently more windy conditions might be expected there. Further, it\r\nwas judged that information concerning this region would be forthcoming\r\nfrom the ship, which had cruised westward after leaving Adelie Land in\r\nJanuary 1912. The field in that direction was therefore not so promising\r\nas that to the east.\r\n\r\nOn this account the air-tractor sledge, of somewhat doubtful utility,\r\nwas detailed for use to the westward of Winter Quarters, and, as it\r\nwas obvious that the engine could only be operated in moderately good\r\nweather, its final departure was postponed until December.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the parties which had been arranged and\r\nwhich, now fully equipped, were on the tiptoe of expectation to depart.\r\n\r\n(1) A Southern Party composed of Bage (leader), Webb and Hurley. The\r\nspecial feature of their work was to be magnetic observations in the\r\nvicinity of the South Magnetic Pole.\r\n\r\n(2) A Southern Supporting Party, including Murphy (leader), Hunter and\r\nLaseron, who were to accompany the Southern Party as far as possible,\r\nreturning to Winter Quarters by the end of November.\r\n\r\n(3) A Western Party of three men--Bickerton (leader), Hodgeman and\r\nWhetter--who were to traverse the coastal highlands west of the Hut.\r\nTheir intention was to make use of the air-tractor sledge and the\r\ndeparture of the party was fixed for early December.\r\n\r\n(4) Stillwell, in charge of a Near Eastern Party, was to map the\r\ncoastline between Cape Denison and the Mertz Glacier-Tongue, dividing\r\nthe work into two stages. In the first instance, Close and Hodgeman were\r\nto assist him; all three acting partly as supports to the other eastern\r\nparties working further afield. After returning to the Hut at the end\r\nof November for a further supply of stores, he was to set out again with\r\nClose and Laseron in order to complete the work.\r\n\r\n(5) An Eastern Coastal Party composed of Madigan (leader), McLean and\r\nCorrell was to start in early November with the object of investigating\r\nthe coastline beyond the Mertz Glacier.\r\n\r\n(6) Finally, a Far-Eastern Party, assisted by the dogs, was to push\r\nout rapidly overland to the southward of Madigan's party, mapping more\r\ndistant sections of the coastline, beyond the limit to which the latter\r\nparty would be likely to reach.\r\n\r\nAs the plans for the execution of such a journey had of necessity to\r\nbe more provisional than in the case of the others, I determined to\r\nundertake it, accompanied by Ninnis and Mertz, both of whom had so ably\r\nacquitted themselves throughout the Expedition and, moreover, had always\r\nbeen in charge of the dogs.\r\n\r\nNovember opened with more moderate weather, auguring still better\r\nconditions for midsummer. Accordingly November 6 was fixed as the date\r\nof final departure for several of the parties. The evening of November\r\n5 was made a special occasion: a farewell dinner, into which everybody\r\nentered very heartily.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th, however, we found a strong blizzard raging\r\nand the landscape blotted out by drift-snow, which did not clear until\r\nthe afternoon of the following day.\r\n\r\nAt the first opportunity, Murphy, Hunter and Laseron (supporting the\r\nSouthern Party) got away, but found the wind so strong at a level of\r\none thousand feet on the glacier that they anchored their sledge and\r\nreturned to the Hut for the night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning saw them off finally and, later in the day, the\r\nNear-Eastern Party (Stillwell, Close and Hodgeman) and the Eastern\r\nCoastal Party (Madigan, McLean and Correll) got under way, though there\r\nwas still considerable wind.\r\n\r\nMy own party was to leave on the 9th for, assisted by the dogs, we could\r\neasily catch up to the other eastern parties, and it was our intention\r\nnot to part company with them until all were some distance out on the\r\nroad together.\r\n\r\nThe wind increased on the 9th and the air became charged with drift,\r\nso we felt sure that those who preceded us would still be camped at\r\nAladdin's Cave, and that the best course was to wait.\r\n\r\nAt this date the penguin rookeries were full of new-laid eggs, and the\r\npopular taste inclined towards omelettes, in the production of which\r\nMertz was a past master. I can recall the clamouring throng who pressed\r\nround for the final omelette as Mertz officiated at the stove just\r\nbefore we left on the 10th.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful calm afternoon as the sledge mounted up the long icy\r\nslopes. The Southern Party (Bage, Webb and Hurley) were a short distance\r\nin advance, but by the help of the dogs we were soon abreast of\r\nthem. Then Bickerton, who had given Bage's party a pull as far as the\r\nthree-mile post, bade us good-bye and returned to the Hut where he was\r\nto remain in charge with Whetter and Hannam until the return of Murphy's\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAt Aladdin's Cave, while some prepared supper, others selected tanks of\r\nfood from the depot and packed the sledges. After the meal, the Southern\r\nParty bade us farewell and set off at a rapid rate, intending to\r\noverhaul their supporting party on the same evening at the Cathedral\r\nGrotto, eleven and three-quarter miles from the Hut. Many finishing\r\ntouches had to be put to our three sledges and two teams of dogs, so\r\nthat the departure was delayed till next morning.\r\n\r\nWe were up betimes and a good start was made before anything came of the\r\novercast sky which had formed during the night. The rendezvous appointed\r\nfor meeting the others, in case we had not previously caught them up,\r\nwas eighteen miles south-east of Aladdin's Cave. But, with a view to\r\navoiding crevasses as much as possible, a southerly course was followed\r\nfor several miles, after which it was directed well to the east. In the\r\nmeantime the wind had arisen and snow commenced to fall soon after noon.\r\nIn such weather it was impossible to locate the other parties, so a halt\r\nwas made and the tent pitched after eight miles.\r\n\r\nFive days of wind and drift followed, and for the next two days we\r\nremained in camp. Then, on the afternoon of the 13th, the drift became\r\nless dense, enabling us to move forward on an approximate course to what\r\nwas judged to be the vicinity of the rendezvous, where we camped again\r\nfor three days.\r\n\r\nComfortably ensconced in the sleeping-bags, we ate only a small ration\r\nof food; the savings being carefully put away for a future \"rainy day.\"\r\nOutside, the dogs had at first an unpleasant time until they were buried\r\nin snow which sheltered them from the stinging wind. Ninnis and Mertz\r\ntook turns day by day attending to their needs.\r\n\r\nThe monotony and disappointment of delay were just becoming acute\r\nwhen the wind fell off, and the afternoon of November 16 turned out\r\ngloriously fine.\r\n\r\nSeveral excursions were immediately made in the neighbourhood to seek\r\nfor the whereabouts of the other parties, but all were unsuccessful. At\r\nlength it occurred to us that something serious might have happened, so\r\nwe left our loads and started back at a gallop for Aladdin's Cave with\r\ntwo empty sledges, Mertz careering ahead on skis over the sastrugi\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards two black specks were seen away in the north; a\r\nglance with the binoculars leaving no doubt as to the identity of the\r\nparties. We returned to the loads, and, having picked them up, made a\r\ncourse to the east to intercept the other men.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy camp that evening!with the three tents pitched together,\r\nwhile we compared our experiences of the previous six days and made\r\nplans for the outward journey.\r\n\r\nOur sledge-meter had already suffered through bumping over rough ice and\r\nsastrugi, and an exchange was made with the stronger one on Stillwell's\r\nsledge. A quantity of food was also taken over from him and the loads\r\nwere finally adjusted.\r\n\r\nThe details and weights of the equipment on the three sledges belonging\r\nto my party are sufficiently interesting to be set out at length below.\r\nMost of the items were included in the impedimenta of all our parties,\r\nbut slight variations were necessary to meet particular stances or to\r\nsatisfy the whim of an individual.\r\n\r\nTOTAL LOAD\r\n\r\n The Principal Sledge, 11ft. long, 45 lb.\r\n\r\n Fittings for Same: Instrument-box 7 lb. 5 oz.; cooker-box, 7 lb.\r\n 6 oz.; kerosene-tray, 3 lb.; mast-attachment, 2 lb. 8 oz.; mast, 1 lb.\r\n 16 oz.; spar, 1 lb.  8 oz.; decking (canvas and bamboo), 3 lb. 5 oz.;\r\n rigging, 7.5 oz.; 5 leather straps, 5 lb.....  77 lb. 6.5 oz.\r\n\r\n Drill Tent, strengthened and attached to poles, also floor-cloth,\r\n 33 lb.

It was decided that Gadget, a rather miserable\r\nanimal, who had shown herself useless as a puller thus far, should be\r\nkilled. The following dogs then remained:--Basilisk, Shackleton, Ginger\r\nBitch, Franklin, John Bull, Mary, Haldane, Pavlova, Fusilier, Jappy,\r\nGinger, George, Johnson, Castor, Betli and Blizzard.\r\n\r\nWe went in pursuit of the other six men over a surface of rough\r\nsastrugi. The dogs, who were in fine fettle, rushed the sledges along,\r\nmaking frantic efforts to catch up to the parties ahead, who showed as\r\nblack specks across the white undulating plain.\r\n\r\nAt noon all lunched together, after which we separated, shaking hands\r\nwarmly all round and interchanging the sledgers' \"Good luck!\" Our dogs\r\ndrew away rapidly to the east, travelling on a slight down grade; the\r\nother two parties with their man-hauled sledges following in the same\r\ndirection. The surface was splendid, the weather conditions were ideal,\r\nthe pace, if anything, too rapid, for capsizes were apt to occur in\r\nracing over high sastrugi. Any doubts as to the capability of the\r\ndogs to pull the loads were dispelled; in fact, on this and on many\r\nsubsequent occasions, two of us were able to sit, each one on a sledge,\r\nwhile the third broke trail ahead.\r\n\r\nIn sledging over wide, monotonous wastes with dogs as the motive power,\r\nit is necessary to have a forerunner, that is, somebody to go ahead and\r\npoint the way, otherwise the dogs will run aimlessly about. Returning\r\nover old tracks, they will pull along steadily and keep a course. In\r\nAdelie Land we had no opportunity of verifying this, as the continuous\r\nwinds soon obliterated the impression of the runners.\r\n\r\nIf the weather is reasonably good and food is ample, sledging dogs enjoy\r\ntheir work. Their desire to pull is doubtless inborn, implanted in a\r\nlong line of ancestors who have faithfully served the Esquimaux. We\r\nfound that the dogs were glad to get their harnesses on and to be led\r\naway to the sledge. Really, it was often a case of the dog leading the\r\nman, for, as soon as its harness was in place, the impatient animal\r\nstrained to drag whatever might be attached to the other end of the\r\nrope. Before attaching a team of dogs to a sledge, it was necessary to\r\nanchor the latter firmly, otherwise in their ardour they would make off\r\nwith it before everything was ready.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question as to the value of dogs as a means of traction\r\nin the Polar regions, except when travelling continuously over very\r\nrugged country, over heavily crevassed areas, or during unusually\r\nbad weather. It is in such special stances that the superiority of\r\nman-hauling has been proved. Further, in an enterprise where human life\r\nis always at stake, it is only fair to put forward the consideration\r\nthat the dogs represent a reserve of food in case of extreme emergency.\r\n\r\nWe continued due eastwards until five o'clock on the afternoon of the\r\n17th at an altitude of two thousand six hundred feet. On the crest of a\r\nridge, which bore away in distinct outline, on our left, a fine panorama\r\nof coastal scenery was visible. Far off on the eastern horizon the Mertz\r\nGlacier Tongue discovered itself in a long wall touched in luminous\r\nbands by the south-western sun. A wide valley fell away in front, and\r\nbeyond it was a deep indentation of the coastline, which would make it\r\nnecessary for us to follow a more southerly course in order to round its\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nI determined to convey to the other parties my intentions, which had\r\nbecome more defined on seeing this view; and, in the meantime, we halted\r\nand treated ourselves to afternoon tea. This innovation in the ordinary\r\nroutine was extended to a custom by saving a portion of the lunch ration\r\nfor a \"snack\" at 5 P.M. on all days when the weather was moderately\r\ngood. As latitude sights were required at midday and longitude shots at\r\n5 P.M., the arrangement was very convenient, for, while one of us made\r\ntea, the other two took the observations.\r\n\r\nAbout 6 P.M. the two man-hauled sledges came up with us, our plans for\r\nthe future were reviewed and the final instructions were given. We bade\r\nour comrades adieu and, turning to the south-east, descended quickly\r\ndown a long slope leading into the valley. The sky was overcast and it\r\nwas almost impossible to see the irregularities of the surface. Only a\r\ndull-white glare met the eyes, and the first indication of a hillock was\r\nto stub one's toes against it, or of a depression to fall into it. We\r\npulled up the dogs at 7.30 P.M. after covering thirteen and a quarter\r\nmiles in the day.\r\n\r\nAt 9.45 A.M. on November 18 everything was ready for a fresh start. The\r\nother parties could be seen rapidly bearing down on us under full\r\nsail, but our willing teams had soon dragged the three sledges over an\r\neminence and out of their sight.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely day; almost like a dream after the lengthy months of\r\nharassing blizzards. A venturesome skua gull appeared at lunch time,\r\njust as an observation for latitude was being taken. By the time Ninnis\r\nhad unpacked the rifle the bird had flown away.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the sastrugi was found to vary from that which obtained\r\nfarther west, owing to a slight swing in the direction of the prevailing\r\nwind. The irregularities in the coastline account for this; the wind\r\ntending to flow down to sea-level by the nearest route.\r\n\r\nTo the north-west, behind us, a projecting ridge of rock--Madigan\r\nNunatak--came into sight. From the camp of the previous evening it had\r\nevidently been hidden from view by an undulation in the surface.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon it was noted that the surface had become very\r\ndeeply eroded by the wind, troughs three feet in depth being common,\r\ninto which the sledges frequently capsized. Each of us took it in turn\r\nto run ahead, jumping from one sastruga to another. As these were firm\r\nand polished by the constant wind, one often slipped with a sudden shock\r\nto the ground. Our bodies were well padded with clothing and we were\r\nbeginning to get into good form, so that these habitual tumbles were\r\ntaken with the best grace we could muster. I surprised myself during the\r\nafternoon, when my turn came as forerunner, by covering two and a half\r\nmiles at a jog-trot without a break. The grade was slightly downhill and\r\nthe sledges moved along of their own accord, accelerated by jerks\r\nfrom the dogs, gliding at right angles to the knife-edge crests of the\r\nsnow-waves.\r\n\r\nThe roughness of the surface was not without its effect on the\r\nsledge-meter, which had to be repaired temporarily. It was a matter of\r\nsome inconvenience that after this date its records were erroneous\r\nand approximate distances were only obtained by checking the readings\r\nagainst absolute observations made for latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nAt 5.30 P.M. a dark object stood in salient relief above the white\r\ncontour of the snowy sky-line on the right. Suppressing our excitement,\r\nwe pressed on eagerly, changing course so as to approach it. At nine\r\no'clock it resolved itself into the summit of an imposing mountain\r\nrising up from a mysterious valley. Aurora Peak, as it was named, was to\r\nbe a prominent landmark for several days to come.\r\n\r\nAll were ready to be on the move at 8.45 A.M. on November 19. While\r\nMertz and Ninnis built a cairn of snow, I wrote a note to be left on it\r\nin a tin, containing instructions to Stillwell in case he should happen\r\non the locality.\r\n\r\nThe weather was good and the temperatures were high, ranging at this\r\ntime (one month from midsummer) between zero and 18 degrees F. When\r\nwe camped for lunch the air was quite calm and the sun's rays were\r\nextremely warm.\r\n\r\nThe surface became softer and smoother as the afternoon lengthened until\r\nMertz was tempted to put on his skis. He then became forerunner for the\r\nremainder of the day.\r\n\r\nMertz, who was skilled in the use of skis, found them of great service\r\non this and on many future occasions. At such times he would relieve\r\nNinnis and myself in the van. On the other hand, over deeply furrowed\r\nsastrugi or blue ice, or during a strong wind, unless it were at our\r\nbacks, skiing was impossible.\r\n\r\nOwing to a steeper down grade, the sledges were now commencing to\r\nrun more freely and improvised brakes were tried, all of which were\r\nineffectual in restraining the dogs. The pace became so hot that a small\r\nobstacle would capsize the sledge, causing it to roll over and over down\r\nthe slope. The dogs, frantically pulling in various directions to keep\r\nahead of the load, became hopelessly entangled in their traces and were\r\ndragged along unresistingly until the sledge stopped of its own accord\r\nor was arrested by one of us. At length, most of the dogs were allowed\r\nto run loose, and, with a man holding on behind and a couple of dogs\r\npulling ahead, the loads were piloted down a steep slope for several\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe evening camp was situated at the crest of the last but steepest fall\r\ninto a wide glacial valley which was clearly seen to sweep northwards\r\npast the eastern side of Aurora Peak. Looking back we could define our\r\ntrack winding down in the bed of a long shallow valley, while, uprising\r\non either hand near the rim of the plateau were crevassed bluffs where\r\nthe ice of the tableland streamed abruptly over the underlying crags.\r\n\r\nNinnis had a touch of snow-blindness which rapidly improved under\r\ntreatment. The stock cure for this very irritating and painful affection\r\nis to place first of all tiny \"tabloids\" of zinc sulphate and cocaine\r\nhydrochloride under the eyelids where they quickly dissolve in the\r\ntears, alleviating the smarting, \"gritty\" sensation which is usually\r\ndescribed by the sufferer. He then bandages the eyes and escapes, if he\r\nis lucky, into the darkness of his sleeping-bag.\r\n\r\nIn certain lights one is sure to be attacked more or less severely, and\r\ncoloured glasses should be worn continually. Unfortunately, goggles\r\nare sometimes impracticable on account of the moisture from the breath\r\ncovering the glasses with an icy film or driving snow clogging them\r\nand obscuring the view. For such contingencies narrow slots of various\r\nshapes are cut in plates or discs of wood or bone in the Esquimaux\r\nfashion. The amount of light reaching the eye can thus be reduced to the\r\nlimit of moderately clear vision.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 20th broke with wind and drift which persisted until\r\nafter noon. Already everything had been packed up, but, as there was a\r\nsteep fall in front and crevasses were not far distant, we decided not\r\nto start until the air was clear of snow.\r\n\r\nWhen at last a move was possible, it became evident that the dogs could\r\nnot be trusted to pull the sledges down to the edge of the glacier. So\r\nthey were tethered to ice-axes while we lowered the sledges one by\r\none, all three checking their speed, assisted by rope brakes round the\r\nrunners. Finally, the impatient dogs were brought down and harnessed in\r\ntheir accustomed places.\r\n\r\nRapid travelling now commenced over a perfectly smooth surface, sloping\r\ngently to the bed of the glacier. Mertz shot ahead on skis, and our\r\ncolumn of dogs and sledges followed quickly in his trail.\r\n\r\nFrom this day forward our \"order of procession\" was as follows:--Behind\r\nthe forerunner came a team of dogs dragging two sledges joined together\r\nby a short length of alpine rope. Bringing up the rear were the rest of\r\nthe dogs dragging the third sledge. Each team pulled approximately equal\r\nweights; the front load being divided between two sledges. Except when\r\ntaking my turn ahead, I looked after the leading team, Ninnis or Mertz,\r\nas the case might be, driving the one behind.\r\n\r\nWe skirted Aurora Peak on its south-eastern side. The mountain rose to\r\na height of about seventeen hundred feet on our left, its steep sides\r\nbeing almost completely snow-clad.\r\n\r\nThe wide depression of the Mertz Glacier lay ahead, and on its far side\r\nthe dim outline of uprising icy slopes was visible, though at the time\r\nwe could not be certain as to their precise nature.\r\n\r\nAs the sledges passed Aurora Peak, Blizzard and Ginger Bitch ran\r\nalongside. The former had hurt one of her forefeet on the previous day\r\nduring the \"rough-and-tumble\" descending into the valley. Ginger Bitch\r\nwas allowed to go free because she was daily expected to give birth to\r\npups. As she was such a good sledge-dog we could not have afforded\r\nto leave her behind at the Hut, and later events proved that the work\r\nseemed actually to benefit her, for she was at all times the best puller\r\nand the strongest of the pack. However, in permitting both dogs to run\r\nloose that afternoon, there was an element of danger which we had not\r\nsufficiently appreciated.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without any warning, half of my dogs dropped out of sight,\r\nswinging on their harness ropes in a crevasse. Next moment I realized\r\nthat the sledges were in the centre of a bridge covering a crevasse,\r\ntwenty-five feet wide, along the edge of which part of the team had\r\nbroken through.\r\n\r\nWe spent many anxious moments before they were all hauled to the\r\ndaylight and the sledge rested on solid ground. There were other\r\ncrevasses about and almost immediately afterwards Ginger Bitch and\r\nBlizzard had broken through into a fissure and were frantically\r\nstruggling to maintain their hold on the edge. They were speedily\r\nrescued; following which Ginger Bitch gave birth to the first of a large\r\nlitter of pups. After this second accident we decided to camp.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of November 21 there was a good deal of wind\r\nand drift which made travelling rather miserable. Occasionally open\r\ncrevasses would break the surface of the snow.\r\n\r\nWhen the light at last improved, a nunatak was observed some fifteen\r\nmiles or more to the south rising out of the glacier--Correll Nunatak.\r\nAhead of us was a glittering line of broken ice, stretching at right\r\nangles to our path. Studded about on the icy plain were immense\r\ncauldrons, like small craters in appearance. Then an area dotted over\r\nwith ice mounds approached and crevasses became correspondingly more\r\nnumerous. The dogs frequently broke through them but were easily\r\nextricated in every instance.\r\n\r\nCamp was pitched for lunch in the vicinity of many gaping holes leading\r\ndown into darkness, places where the bridges over large crevasses had\r\nfallen in. Mertz prepared the lunch and Ninnis and I went to photograph\r\nan open crevasse near by. Returning, we diverged on reaching the back\r\nof the tent, he passing round on one side and I on the other. The next\r\ninstant I heard a bang on the ice and, swinging round, could see nothing\r\nof my companion but his head and arms. He had broken through the lid\r\nof a crevasse fifteen feet wide and was hanging on to its edge close\r\nto where the camera lay damaged on the ice. He was soon dragged into\r\nsafety. Looking down into the black depths we realized how narrowly\r\nhe had escaped. As the tent was found to encroach partly on the same\r\ncrevasse, it may be imagined that we did not dally long over the meal.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the weather became clear and fine, but, as if to offset\r\nthis, the broken surface became impassable. The region was one of serac\r\nwhere the glacier was puckered up, folded and crushed. After several\r\nrepulses in what seemed to be promising directions, we were finally\r\nforced to camp, having ten miles to our credit.\r\n\r\nWhilst Mertz fed the dogs and prepared hoosh, Ninnis and I roped up and\r\nwent off to search for a passage.\r\n\r\nAll around, the glacier was pressed up into great folds, two hundred\r\nfeet in height and between one quarter and a third of a mile from crest\r\nto crest. The ridges of the folds were either domes or open rifts\r\npartly choked with snow. Precipitous ice-falls and deep cauldrons were\r\nencountered everywhere. To the north the glacier flattened out; to the\r\nsouth it was more rugged.\r\n\r\nIn this chaos we wandered for some miles until a favourable line of\r\nadvance had been discovered for the march on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe first three miles, on the 22nd, were over a piece of very dangerous\r\ncountry, after which our prospects improved and we came to the border of\r\na level plain.\r\n\r\nThere Mertz slipped on his skis, went ahead and set a good pace.\r\nAlthough the sky had become overcast and snow fell fitfully, our\r\nprogress was rapid towards the rising slopes of the land on the eastern\r\nside of the glacier. Over the last three miles of the day's journey the\r\nsurface was raised in large, pimply masses surrounded by wide fissures.\r\nInto one of the fissures, bridged by snow, Ninnis's sledge fell, but\r\nfortunately jammed itself just below the surface. As it was, we had\r\na long job getting it up again, having to unpack the sledge in the\r\ncrevasse until it was light enough to be easily manipulated. Despite the\r\ndelay, our day's run was sixteen and a half miles.\r\n\r\nAt 8 A.M. on the 23rd everything was in readiness for a fresh start.\r\nModerate drift and wind descended from the hills and there were yet\r\nthree miles of hidden perils to be passed. With the object of making our\r\nadvance less dangerous, various devices were employed.\r\n\r\nFirst of all the towing rope of the rear sledge was secured to the back\r\nof the preceding sledge. This arrangement had to be abandoned because\r\nthe dogs of Ninnis's team persisted in entangling themselves and working\r\nindependently of the dogs in front. Next, all the sledges were joined\r\ntogether with all the dogs pulling in front. The procession was then so\r\nlong that it was quite unmanageable on account of the tortuous nature\r\nof our track through the labyrinth. In the long run, it was decided that\r\nour original method was the best, provided that special precautions were\r\ntaken over the more hazardous crossings.\r\n\r\nThe usual procedure was, that the forerunner selected the best crossing\r\nof a crevasse, testing it with a ski-stick. The dog teams were then\r\nbrought up to the spot and the forerunner went over the snow-bridge and\r\nstood on the other side, sufficiently far away to allow the first team\r\nto cross to him and to clear the crevasse. Then the second team was\r\npiloted to safety before the forerunner had resumed his position in\r\nfront. This precaution was very necessary, for otherwise the dogs in the\r\nrear would make a course direct for wherever the front dogs happened\r\nto be, cutting across corners and most probably dragging their sledge\r\nsideways into a crevasse; the likeliest way to lose it altogether.\r\n\r\nOften enough the dogs broke through the snow-bridges on the morning\r\nof the 23rd, but only once were matters serious, when Ninnis's sledge,\r\ndoubtless on account of its extra weight, again broke through a lid of\r\nsnow and was securely jammed in a crevasse just below the surface.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we were in a serious predicament, for the sledge was\r\nin such a position that an unskilful movement would have sent it hurling\r\ninto the chasm below. So the unpacking of the load was a tedious and\r\ndelicate operation. The freight consisted chiefly of large, soldered\r\ntins, packed tightly with dried seal meat. Each of these weighed about\r\nninety pounds and all were most securely roped to the sledge. The sledge\r\nwas got up and reloaded without the loss of a single tin, and once more\r\nwe breathed freely.\r\n\r\nA valley almost free of crevasses was chosen as the upward track to the\r\nplateau. We threw in our weight hauling with the dogs, and had a long,\r\nsteep drag over furrowed neve, pitching the tent after a day's journey\r\nof twelve miles.\r\n\r\nOn waking up on November 24 I found that my watch had stopped. I had\r\nbeen so tired on the previous evening that I had fallen asleep without\r\nremembering to wind it. The penalty of this accident was paid in my\r\nbeing forced to take an extra set of observations in order to start the\r\nwatch again at correct time relative to the Hut.\r\n\r\nBesides the observations for position, necessary for navigation, sets of\r\nangles were taken from time to time to fix the positions of objects\r\nof interest appearing within the field of view, while the magnetic\r\nvariation was obtained at intervals. In this work Ninnis always\r\nassisted me. Mertz boiled the hypsometer when necessary to ascertain our\r\nelevation above sea-level. The meteorological conditions were carefully\r\nnoted several times each day for future comparison with those of other\r\nparties and of Winter Quarters.\r\n\r\nThe day's work on November 24 brought us high up on the slopes. Away to\r\nthe north-west Aurora Peak was still visible, standing up like a mighty\r\nbeacon pointing the way back to the Hut. Below lay the Mertz Glacier\r\nextending out to sea as a floating tongue beyond the horizon. Inland,\r\nsome twenty miles to the south, it mounted up in seamed and riven\r\n\"cataracts\" to a smooth, broad and shallow groove which wound into the\r\nice-cap. Ahead, on our south-east course, the ground still rose, but\r\nto the north-east the ice-sheet fell away in long wide valleys, at the\r\nextremity of some of which icebergs were visible frozen into distant\r\nsea-ice.\r\n\r\nThe tent was raised at 10 P.M. in a forty-mile wind with light drift;\r\ntemperature 10 degrees F. The altitude of this camp was two thousand\r\nthree hundred and fifty feet.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst features of drift overnight is that sledges and dogs\r\nbecome buried in snow and have to be dug out in the morning. Thus on\r\nthe 25th it was 10 A.M. before we got away in a strong wind, with flying\r\nsnow, across fields of sastrugi.\r\n\r\nThe dogs detested the wind and, as their heads were so near the\r\nground, they must have found the incessant stream of thick drift very\r\ntantalizing. The snow became caked over their eyes so that every few\r\nminutes they had to scrape it away with their paws or rub their faces on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at 6 P.M. after a miserable day, covering sixteen miles in\r\nall.\r\n\r\nNovember 26 broke overcast, the light being bad for travelling and the\r\nwind still strong. Nevertheless we set out at 10 A.M. through falling\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nAs the day progressed the wind subsided and Mertz was able to put on his\r\nskis over a surface which sloped gradually away to the east. The light\r\nwas diffused uniformly over the irregularities of snow and ice so that\r\ndepressions only a few feet away were invisible. Black objects, on the\r\nother hand, stood out with startling distinctness, and our attention was\r\nsoon arrested by a hazy, dark patch which appeared in front and to the\r\nleft. At first there was much doubt as to its nature, but it was\r\nsoon clear that it must be a group of rocks, apparently situated at a\r\nconsiderable distance. They were subsequently found to be sixty miles\r\naway (Organ Pipe Cliffs, near Cape Blake).\r\n\r\nPresently our course ended abruptly at the edge of a precipitous fall.\r\nWe skirted round this for a while, but were ultimately forced to camp\r\nowing to the uncertainty of the light and the proximity of several large\r\ncrevasses.\r\n\r\nAt 11 P.M. the sky cleared and a better idea could be gained of what\r\nlay ahead. In a line between our elevated position and the distant rocky\r\noutcrops the ice fell in a steep descent to a broad, glacial valley,\r\nundulating and in places traversed by torn masses of serac-ice. We\r\nexamined the country to the east very carefully with a view to selecting\r\na track for the journey next day and finally resolved to pass to the\r\nsouth of a large ice-capped island--Dixson Island, which was only about\r\nten miles to the north-east, set within Ninnis Glacier near its western\r\nborder\r\n\r\nOn the 27th Mertz and I roped up, reconnoitred for a while and returned\r\nto the sledges. We then spent several hours in advancing a mile over\r\nbadly broken ground, arriving at a slope covered with sastrugi and\r\ndescending steeply for one thousand feet into the bed of the glacier.\r\n\r\nIn order the more safely to negotiate this, the dogs were all let\r\nloose excepting two in each sledge. Even then the sledges were often\r\nuncontrollable, rolling over and over many times before the bottom was\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nWhen the dogs were re-harnessed it was found that Betli was missing\r\nand was not to be seen when we scanned the slopes in our rear with\r\nbinoculars. It was expected that unless she had fallen into a crevasse\r\nshe would turn up at the camp that night. However, she did not reappear,\r\nand we saw no more of her. Two other dogs, Jappy and Fusilier, had been\r\npreviously killed, as neither was of any use as a puller. Blizzard, who\r\nhad been always a great favourite with us, had to be shot next day.\r\n\r\nWhen it had reached the edge of the glacier, our path led over a solid\r\nocean rising and faring in billows, two hundred and fifty feet in\r\nheight; no doubt caused by the glacier in its northward movement being\r\ncompressed against the southern side of Dixson Island. Still, the\r\n\"caravan\" made considerable progress, ending with a day's journey of\r\nsixteen miles.\r\n\r\nDuring the small hours of November 28 the wind rose to a velocity of\r\nsixty miles per hour, but gradually diminished to a twenty-knot breeze\r\nas the day advanced. Light snow fell from a sky which was densely\r\nclouded.\r\n\r\nWe still pursued a devious track amid rolling waves of ice, encountering\r\nbeds of soft snow through which the sledges moved slowly. By 6 P.M.\r\npinnacles and hummocks stood around on every side, and the light was\r\nsuch that one could not distinguish crevasses until he was on top of\r\nthem. We had to camp and be satisfied with seven miles \"to the good.\" By\r\nthis time the dogs were in good training and grew noticeably ravenous.\r\nIn the evening, before they were properly tethered, Shackleton seized\r\na one-week provision bag, ripped it open and ate a block of butter\r\nweighing more than two and a half pounds. This was a loss to us, as\r\nbutter was regarded as a particular delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining brightly next day and it was at once evident that we\r\nwere in a zone of tumbled and disrupted ice.\r\n\r\nFor many hours a way was won through a mighty turmoil of serac and over\r\ninnumerable crevasses with varied fortune. Just before lunch my two\r\nsledges were nearly lost through the dogs swinging sharply to one side\r\nbefore the second sledge had cleared a rather rotten snow-bridge. I was\r\nup with the dogs at the time, and the first intimation I received of\r\nan accident was on seeing the dogs and front sledge being dragged\r\nbackwards; the rear sledge was hanging vertically in a crevasse.\r\nExerting all my strength I held back the front sledge, and in a few\r\nmoments was joined by Ninnis and Mertz, who soon drove a pick and\r\nice-axe down between the runners and ran out an anchoring rope.\r\n\r\nIt was a ticklish business recovering the sledge which hung suspended in\r\nthe crevasse. It could not be lifted vertically as its bow was caught in\r\na V-shaped cornice formed by an overhanging mass of snow. To add to our\r\ntroubles the ground all about the place was precarious and unsafe.\r\n\r\nMertz and Ninnis therefore lowered me down and I attached a rope to the\r\ntail-end of the sledge. The bow-rope and tail-rope were then manipulated\r\nalternately until the bow of the sledge was manoeuvred slowly through\r\nthe gaping hole in the snow-lid and was finally hauled up on to level\r\nground. No more remarkable test of the efficiency of the sledge straps\r\nand the compactness of the load could have been made.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch Mertz ascended a high point and was able to trace out a\r\nroute which conducted us in a few hours to a better surface.\r\n\r\nWe were now at an elevation of from four hundred to five hundred feet\r\nabove sea-level, running across a beam-wind on our right which increased\r\nduring the afternoon. A rising blizzard made it necessary to camp after\r\na day's run of ten and one-third miles.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew up to seventy miles an hour during the night, but eased in\r\nstrength early on November 30. At 10 A.M. we tried to make a start, but\r\nthe dogs refused to face the drift. On the wind becoming gusty in the\r\nafternoon, it was once more possible to travel, and we set out.\r\n\r\nDense drift was still to be seen pouring over the highlands to the\r\nsouth-east. Above the glacier ahead whirlies, out-lined in high\r\nrevolving columns of snow, \"stalked about\" in their wayward courses.\r\n\r\nThe sledges ran through a sea of crevassed, blue ice, over ridges and\r\npast open chasms. Seven miles brought us to the \"foot-hills\" on the\r\neastern border of the Ninnis Glacier, where we pitched camp.\r\n\r\nThe first day of December was still and hot, with brilliant sunshine.\r\nThe shade temperature reached 34 degrees F. and the snow became so\r\nsticky that it was as much as we and the dogs could do to move the\r\nsledges up the slopes. As the evening lengthened and the sun sank\r\nlower the surface froze hard and our toil was lightened. At midnight we\r\nreached an altitude of nine hundred feet.\r\n\r\nDecember 2 was another warm, bright day. The surface was atrociously\r\nbad; hard, sharp sastrugi, never less than two feet high and in many\r\ninstances three feet six inches from crest to trough. The dogs were not\r\nable to exert a united pull for there were never more than half of them\r\nin action at a time.\r\n\r\nOnce more we were at a comparatively high altitude and a fine view\r\npresented itself to the north. One could look back to the mainland\r\nslopes descending on the western side of the Ninnis Glacier. Then the\r\nglacier, tumultuous and broken, was seen to extend far out into the\r\nfrozen sea and, sweeping round to the north-east, the eye ranged over\r\na great expanse of floe-ice dotted with bergs. To the east there was\r\na precipitous coastline of dark rock which for a while we thought of\r\nvisiting. But then it seemed likely that Madigan's party would reach\r\nas far east, so we set our faces once more to the rising plateau in the\r\nsouth-east.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the sun was peering over the southern sky-line, and we\r\nhalted at an elevation of one thousand five hundred and fifty feet,\r\nhaving covered eight and a half miles in the day. The temperature was 5\r\ndegrees F.\r\n\r\n\"December 3.--We were not long on the way before the sky became overcast\r\nand light snow fell. The surface was becoming flatter. Camp was pitched\r\nat 11 P.M. after eleven and two-thirds miles.\r\n\r\n\"December 4.--Another day of bad light but the surface improved and good\r\nheadway was made on an easterly course at an elevation of between\r\ntwo thousand and two thousand eight hundred feet. The crevasses were\r\npractically past. The day's march was fifteen miles.\r\n\r\n\"December 5.--A bad day; overcast, snowing and a gale of wind from the\r\neast-south-east. However, we plugged on blindly into it until 7.30 P.M.\r\nand then camped, having done eleven and a half miles.\r\n\r\n\"December 6, 7 and 8.--During these days a dense blizzard raged, the\r\nwind reaching seventy miles per hour. There was nothing to do but lie\r\nin our bags and think out plans for the future. Each morning Ninnis and\r\nMertz took it in turns to go out and feed their charges, who were snugly\r\nburied in the deep snow.\r\n\r\n\"One day in the sleeping-bag does not come amiss after long marches,\r\nbut three days on end is enough to bore any one thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\"Ninnis was not so badly off with a volume of Thackeray, but Mertz\r\nhad come to the end of a small edition of 'Sherlock Holmes' when\r\nblizzard-bound near Aladdin's Cave, and his only diversion on these days\r\nwas to recite passages from memory for our mutual benefit.\"\r\n\r\nI was troubled with an inflammation in the face just at this time, while\r\nNinnis suffered pain owing to a \"whitlow\" on one of his fingers.\r\n\r\nAs usual the food ration was reduced. This caused us to have more than\r\nordinarily vivid dreams. I happened to be awake one night when Ninnis\r\nwas sledging in imagination, vociferously shouting, \"Hike, hike,\" to the\r\ndogs; our equivalent of the usual \"Mush, mush.\"\r\n\r\nDespite considerable wind and drift we got away at 8 A.M. on December\r\n9. The sky was overcast and there was nothing to be seen except a soft\r\ncarpet of newly fallen snow into which we sank half-way to the knees.\r\nThe sledges ran deeply and heavily so that the dogs had to be assisted.\r\nAhead Mertz glided along triumphant, for it was on such occasions that\r\nskis were of the greatest assistance to him.\r\n\r\nDuring the day a snow petrel circled above us for a while and then\r\nreturned to the north.\r\n\r\nThe course was due east at an elevation of two thousand three hundred\r\nfeet and the total distance we threw behind during the day was sixteen\r\nand a half miles.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th light wind and low drift were the order of things. Our\r\nspirits rose when the sky cleared and a slight down grade commenced.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning Ninnis drew our attention to what appeared to be\r\nsmall ice-capped islets fringing the coast, but the distance was too\r\ngreat for us to be sure of their exact nature. Out near the verge of the\r\nhorizon a tract of frozen sea with scattered bergs could be seen.\r\n\r\nNext day more features were distinguishable. The coast was seen to run\r\nin a north-easterly direction as a long peninsula ending in a sharp\r\ncape--Cape Freshfield. The north appeared to be filled with frozen sea\r\nthough we could not be certain that it was not dense pack-ice. Little\r\ndid we know that Madigan's party, about a week later, would be marching\r\nover the frozen sea towards Cape Freshfield in the north-east.\r\n\r\nAt 10 P.M. on the 11th, at an altitude of one thousand eight hundred\r\nfeet, the highland we were traversing fell away rapidly and sea-ice\r\nopened up directly in front of us. The coastal downfalls to the\r\nsouth-east fell in rugged masses to a vertical barrier, off the seaward\r\nface of which large, tabular bergs were grouped within environing floe.\r\n\r\nThroughout December 12 a somewhat irregular course was made to the\r\nsouth-east and south to avoid the broken area ahead. We had had enough\r\nof crevasses and wished to be clear of serac-ice in the future.\r\n\r\nFor some days Ninnis had been enduring the throbbing pain of a whitlow\r\nand had not been having sufficient sleep. He always did his share of the\r\nwork and had undoubtedly borne a great deal of pain without showing it.\r\nOn several nights I noticed that he sat up in his sleeping-bag for hours\r\npuffing away at a pipe or reading. At last the pain became so acute\r\nthat he asked me to lance his finger. This was successfully accomplished\r\nafter breakfast on the 13th and during the day he had much relief.\r\n\r\nWhile Ninnis rested before we made a start, Mertz and I re-arranged the\r\nsledges and their loads. A third sledge was no longer necessary, so the\r\none usually driven by Ninnis, which had been damaged, was discarded and\r\nall the gear was divided between the other two sledges in nearly equal\r\namounts. When the work was completed, the rear sledge carried an extra\r\nweight of fifty pounds. As, however, both food for men and dogs were to\r\ncome from it, we reckoned that this superadded load would soon diminish.\r\n\r\nOn we went, during the afternoon, up a steep ascent. Crevasses were\r\nso numerous that we took measures to vent them. Some were as much as a\r\nhundred feet in width, filled with snow; others were great open holes\r\nor like huge cauldrons. Close to the windward edge of some of the latter\r\nhigh ramps of neve with bluff faces on the windward side stood up like\r\nmonoliths reaching twenty-five feet in maximum height.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a field of neve was reached and we felt more placid after\r\nthe anxiety of the preceding hours.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage of a snow-filled valley a dull, booming sound like\r\nthe noise of far-distant cannon was heard. It was evidently connected\r\nwith the subsidence of large areas of the surface crust. Apparently\r\nlarge cavities had formed beneath the snow and the weight of ourselves\r\nand the sledges caused the crust to sink and the air to be expelled.\r\n\r\nThe sun appeared late in the day and, as it was almost calm, the last\r\nfew hours of marching were very pleasant. At midnight we camped at an\r\naltitude of one thousand nine hundred feet.\r\n\r\nA light east-south-east wind was blowing as the sledges started away\r\neastward on the morning of December 14. The weather was sunny and the\r\ntemperature registered 21 degrees F.\r\n\r\nMertz and I were happy to know that Ninnis had slept well and was\r\nfeeling much better.\r\n\r\nOur march was interrupted at noon by a latitude observation, after which\r\nMertz went ahead on skis singing his student songs. The dogs rose to the\r\noccasion and pulled eagerly and well. Everything was for once in harmony\r\nand the time was at hand when we should turn our faces homewards.\r\n\r\nMertz was well in advance of us when I noticed him hold up his ski-stick\r\nand then go on. This was a signal for something unusual so, as I\r\napproached the vicinity, I looked out for crevasses or some other\r\nexplanation of his action. As a matter of fact crevasses were not\r\nexpected, since we were on a smooth surface of neve well to the\r\nsouthward of the broken coastal slopes. On reaching the spot where Mertz\r\nhad signalled and seeing no sign of any irregularity, I jumped on to\r\nthe sledge, got out the book of tables and commenced to figure out the\r\nlatitude observation taken on that day. Glancing at the ground a moment\r\nafter, I noticed the faint indication of a crevasse. It was but one of\r\nmany hundred similar ones we had crossed and had no specially dangerous\r\nappearance, but still I turned quickly round, called out a warning word\r\nto Ninnis and then dismissed it from my thoughts.\r\n\r\nNinnis, who was walking along by the side of his sledge, close behind\r\nmy own, heard the warning, for in my backward glance I noticed that he\r\nimmediately swung the leading dogs so as to cross the crevasse squarely\r\ninstead of diagonally as I had done. I then went on with my work.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound from behind except a faint, plaintive whine from one\r\nof the dogs which I imagined was in reply to a touch from Ninnis's whip.\r\nI remember addressing myself to George, the laziest dog in my own team,\r\nsaying, \"You will be getting a little of that, too, George, if you are\r\nnot careful.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I next looked back, it was in response to the anxious gaze of Mertz\r\nwho had turned round and halted in his tracks. Behind me, nothing met\r\nthe eye but my own sledge tracks running back in the distance. Where\r\nwere Ninnis and his sledge?\r\n\r\nI hastened back along the trail thinking that a rise in the ground\r\nobscured the view. There was no such good fortune, however, for I came\r\nto a gaping hole in the surface about eleven feet wide. The lid of a\r\ncrevasse had broken in; two sledge tracks led up to it on the far side\r\nbut only one continued on the other side.\r\n\r\nFrantically waving to Mertz to bring up my sledge, upon which there was\r\nsome alpine rope, I leaned over and shouted into the dark depths below.\r\nNo sound came back but the moaning of a dog, caught on a shelf just\r\nvisible one hundred and fifty feet below. The poor creature appeared\r\nto have broken its back, for it was attempting to sit up with the front\r\npart of its body while the hinder portion lay limp. Another dog lay\r\nmotionless by its side. Close by was what appeared in the gloom to be\r\nthe remains of the tent and a canvas tank containing food for three men\r\nfor a fortnight.\r\n\r\nWe broke back the edge of the neve lid and took turns leaning over\r\nsecured by a rope, calling into the darkness in the hope that our\r\ncompanion might be still alive. For three hours we called unceasingly\r\nbut no answering sound came back. The dog had ceased to moan and lay\r\nwithout a movement. A chill draught was blowing out of the abyss. We\r\nfelt that there was little hope.\r\n\r\nWhy had the first sledge escaped the crevasse? It seemed that I had\r\nbeen fortunate, because my sledge had crossed diagonally, with a greater\r\nchance of breaking the snow-lid. The sledges were within thirty pounds\r\nof the same weight. The explanation appeared to be that Ninnis had\r\nwalked by the side of his sledge, whereas I had crossed it sitting on\r\nthe sledge. The whole weight of a man's body bearing on his foot is a\r\nformidable load and no doubt was sufficient to smash the arch of the\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nBy means of a fishing line we ascertained that it was one hundred and\r\nfifty feet sheer to the ledge on which the remains were seen; on either\r\nside the crevasse descended into blackness. It seemed so very far down\r\nthere and the dogs looked so small that we got out the field glasses,\r\nbut could make out nothing more by their aid.\r\n\r\nAll our available rope was tied together but the total length was\r\ninsufficient to reach the ledge and any idea of going below to\r\ninvestigate and to secure some of the food had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nStunned by the unexpectedness of it all and having exhausted the few\r\nappliances we carried for such a contingency, we felt helpless. In such\r\nmoments action is the only tolerable thing, and if there had been any\r\nexpedient however hazardous which might have been tried, we should have\r\ntaken all and more than the risk. Stricken dumb with the pity of it and\r\nheavy at heart, we turned our minds mechanically to what lay nearest at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThere were rations on the other sledge, and we found that there was a\r\nbare one and a half weeks' food for ourselves and nothing at all for the\r\ndogs. Part of the provisions consisted of raisins and almonds which had\r\nbeen taken as extras or \"perks,\" as they were usually called.\r\n\r\nAmong other losses there were both spade and ice-axe, but fortunately a\r\nspare tent-cover was saved. Mertz's burberry trousers had gone down\r\nwith the sledge and the best substitute he could get was a pair of thick\r\nJaeger woollen under-trousers from the spare clothing we possessed.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon Mertz and I went ahead to a higher point in order\r\nto obtain a better view of our surroundings. At a point two thousand\r\nfour hundred feet above sea-level and three hundred and fifteen and\r\nthree-quarter miles eastward from the Hut, a complete observation for\r\nposition and magnetic azimuth was taken.\r\n\r\nThe coastal slopes were fearfully broken and scaured in their descent to\r\nthe sea, which was frozen out to the horizon. No islands were observed\r\nor anything which could correspond with the land marked by Wilkes as\r\nexisting so much farther to the north. Patches of \"water sky\" were\r\nvisible in two places in the far distance. As we stood looking north\r\na Wilson petrel suddenly appeared and after flitting about for a short\r\ntime departed.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the crevasse and packed the remaining sledge, discarding\r\neverything unnecessary so as to reduce the weight of the load. A thin\r\nsoup was made by boiling up all the old food-bags which could be found.\r\nThe dogs were given some worn-out fur mitts, finnesko and several spare\r\nraw hide straps, all of which they devoured.\r\n\r\nWe still continued to call down into the crevasse at regular intervals\r\nin case our companion might not have been killed outright and, in the\r\nmeantime, have become conscious. There was no reply.\r\n\r\nA weight was lowered on the fishing line as far as the dog which had\r\nearlier shown some signs of life, but there was no response. All were\r\ndead, swallowed up in an instant.\r\n\r\nWhen comrades tramp the road to anywhere through a lonely\r\nblizzard-ridden land in hunger, want and weariness the interests, ties\r\nand fates of each are interwoven in a wondrous fabric of friendship and\r\naffection. The shock of Ninnis's death struck home and deeply stirred\r\nus.\r\n\r\nHe was a fine fellow and a born soldier--and the end:--\r\n\r\n    Life--give me life until the end,\r\n    That at the very top of being,\r\n    The battle spirit shouting in my blood,\r\n    Out of very reddest hell of the fight\r\n    I may be snatched and flung\r\n    Into the everlasting lull,\r\n    The Immortal, Incommunicable Dream.\r\n\r\nAt 9 P.M. we stood by the side of the crevasse and I read the burial\r\nservice. Then Mertz shook me by the hand with a short \"Thank you!\" and\r\nwe turned away to harness up the dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII TOIL AND TRIBULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe homeward track! A few days ago--only few hours ago-our hearts\r\nhad beat hopefully at the prospect and there was no hint of this, the\r\noverwhelming tragedy. Our fellow, comrade, chum, in a woeful instant,\r\nburied in the bowels of the awful glacier. We could not think of it; we\r\nstrove to forget it in the necessity of work, but we knew that the truth\r\nwould assuredly enter our souls in the lonely days to come. It was to be\r\na fight with Death and the great Providence would decide the issue.\r\n\r\nOn the outward journey we had left no depots of provisions en route,\r\nfor it was our bad fortune to meet such impossible country that we had\r\ndecided to make a circuit on our return to Winter Quarters sufficiently\r\nfar inland to avoid the coastal irregularities. As a matter of fact, on\r\nthe very day of the calamity, preparations had been made to cache most\r\nof the food within twenty-four hours, as during the last few days of the\r\njourney we were to make a dash to our \"farthest east\" point. Such were\r\nthe plans, and now we were ranged against unexpected odds.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the dogs, there were six very miserable animals left.\r\nThe best of them had been drafted into the rear team, as it was expected\r\nthat if an accident happened through the collapse of a snow-bridge the\r\nfirst sledge would most probably suffer. For the same reason most of\r\nthe food and other indispensable articles had been carried on the rear\r\nsledge.\r\n\r\nAll the dogs which had perished were big and powerful; Basilisk,\r\nGinger Bitch, Shackleton, Castor, Franklin and John Bull. We had fully\r\nanticipated that those at least would come back alive, at the expense of\r\nthe six dogs in my sledge.\r\n\r\nA silent farewell!--and we started back, aiming to reach our\r\ncamping-ground on December 12 before a snowstorm intervened, as several\r\nthings had been left there which would be of use to us in our straitened\r\nstances. The weather still held good and there were no signs of\r\napproaching snow or wind. So Mertz went ahead on skis, while we plodded\r\nslowly up the hills and dashed recklessly down them. During the descents\r\nI sat on the sledge and we slid over long crevassed slopes in a wild\r\nfashion, almost with a languid feeling that the next one would probably\r\nswallow us up. But we did not much care then, as it was too soon after\r\nlosing our friend.\r\n\r\nAt 2.30 A.M. on December 15 the discarded sledge and broken spade came\r\ninto sight. On reaching them, Mertz cut a runner of the broken sledge\r\ninto two pieces which were used in conjunction with his skis as a\r\nframework on which to pitch the spare tent-cover; our only tent and\r\npoles having been lost. Each time the makeshift shelter was erected,\r\nthese props had to be carefully lashed together at the apex, which stood\r\nfour feet from the ground. Inside, there was just room for two one-man\r\nsleeping-bags on the floor. However, only one man at a time could move\r\nabout and neither of us could ever rise above a sitting posture. Still,\r\nit was a shelter which protected us from the bad weather, and, with\r\nplenty of snow blocks piled around it, was wonderfully resistant to the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nWhen we retired to rest, it was not to sleep but to think out the best\r\nplan for the return journey.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that a descent to the frozen sea would be dangerous on\r\naccount of the heavily crevassed nature of the falling glacier, delay\r\nwould undoubtedly be caused and our distance from the Hut would be\r\nincreased. To decide definitely for the sea-ice would be to take other\r\nrisks as well, since, from the altitude at which we were placed, we\r\ncould not be sure that the floe-ice which covered the sea would provide\r\na good travelling surface. In any case it was likely to be on the point\r\nof breaking up, for the season was nearing midsummer. On the other hand,\r\nthere was on the sea-ice a chance of obtaining seals for food.\r\n\r\nAfter due consideration we resolved to follow the shorter route,\r\nreturning inland over the plateau, for it was reckoned that if the\r\nweather were reasonable we might win through to Winter Quarters with\r\none and a half weeks' rations and the six dogs which still remained,\r\nprovided we ate the dogs to eke out our provisions. Fortunately neither\r\nthe cooker nor the kerosene had been lost.\r\n\r\nGeorge, the poorest of the dogs, was killed and partly fed to the\r\nothers, partly kept for ourselves. The meat was roughly fried on the lid\r\nof the aluminium cooker, an operation which resulted in little more than\r\nscorching the surface. On the whole it was voted good though it had a\r\nstrong, musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly\r\nchewed.\r\n\r\nAs both mugs and spoons had been lost, I made two pannikins out of tins\r\nin which cartridges and matches had been packed, and Mertz carved wooden\r\nspoons out of a portion of the broken sledge. At this camp he also\r\nspliced the handle of the broken shovel which had been picked up, so as\r\nto make it temporarily serviceable.\r\n\r\nIt was midsummer, and therefore we found it easier to drag the sledge\r\nover the snow at night when the surface was frozen hard. Camp was not\r\nfinally broken until 6 P.M., when the long and painful return journey\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nFor fourteen miles the way led up rising snow slopes to the north-west\r\nuntil an elevation of two thousand five hundred feet had been reached.\r\nAfter that, variable grades and flat country were met. Though the sledge\r\nwas light, the dogs required helping and progress was slow. The midnight\r\nsun shone low in the south, and we tramped on through the morning hours,\r\nanxious to reduce the miles which lay ahead.\r\n\r\nEarly on December 16 the sky became rapidly overcast. The snowy land and\r\nthe snowy sky merged to form an enclosed trap, as it seemed to us, while\r\nshowers of snow fell. There were no shadows to create contrast; it was\r\nimpossible to distinguish even the detail of the ground underfoot.\r\nWe stumbled over unseen ridges of the hard neve, our gaze straining\r\nforward. The air was so still that advantage was taken of the calm to\r\nlight the primus and melt some snow in the lee of the sledge. The water,\r\nto which were added a few drops of primus alcohol, helped to assuage our\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\nThe erection of the makeshift tent was a long and tedious operation, and\r\nso, on our return marches, we never again took any refreshment during\r\nthe day's work excepting on this occasion.\r\n\r\nAt 6 A.M., having done twenty miles and ascended to an elevation of\r\nabout two thousand five hundred feet, we pitched camp.\r\n\r\nThere was very little sleep for me that day for I had an unusually bad\r\nattack of snow-blindness. During the time that we rested in the bags\r\nMertz treated one of my eyes three times, the other twice with zinc\r\nsulphate and cocaine.\r\n\r\nOn account of the smallness of the tent a great deal of time was\r\nabsorbed in preparations for \"turning in\" and for getting away from each\r\ncamp. Thus, although we rose before 6 P.M. on December 16, the start was\r\nnot made until 8.30 P.M., notwithstanding the fact that the meal was of\r\nthe \"sketchiest\" character.\r\n\r\nOn that night ours was a mournful procession; the sky thickly clouded,\r\nsnow falling, I with one eye bandaged and the dog Johnson broken down\r\nand strapped on top of the load on the sledge. There was scarcely a\r\nsound; only the rustle of the thick, soft snow as we pushed on, weary\r\nbut full of hope. The dogs dumbly pressed forward in their harness,\r\nforlorn but eager to follow. Their weight now told little upon the\r\nsledge, the work mainly falling upon ourselves. Mertz was tempted to\r\ntry hauling on skis, but came to the conclusion that it did not pay and\r\nthenceforth never again used them.\r\n\r\nClose to the Magnetic Pole as we were, the compass was of little use,\r\nand to steer a straight course to the west without ever seeing anything\r\nof the surroundings was a difficult task. The only check upon the\r\ncorrectness of the bearing was the direction in which trended the old\r\nhard winter sastrugi, channelled out along a line running almost north\r\nand south. The newly fallen snow obliterated these, and frequent halts\r\nhad to be called in order to investigate the buried surface.\r\n\r\nAt 2 A.M. on the 17th we had only covered eleven miles when we stopped\r\nto camp. Then Mertz shot and cut up Johnson while I prepared the supper.\r\n\r\nJohnson had always been a very faithful, hard-working and willing beast,\r\nwith rather droll ways of his own, and we were sorry that his end should\r\ncome so soon. He could never be accused of being a handsome dog, in fact\r\nhe was generally disreputable and dirty.\r\n\r\nAll the dogs were miserable and thin when they reached the stage of\r\nextreme exhaustion. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige\r\nof fat. For a change we sometimes chopped it up finely, mixed it with a\r\nlittle pemmican, and brought all to the boil in a large pot of water. We\r\nwere exceedingly hungry, but there was nothing to satisfy our appetites.\r\nOnly a few ounces were used of the stock of ordinary food, to which was\r\nadded a portion of dog's meat, never large, for each animal yielded\r\nso very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs. They\r\ncrunched the bones and ate the skin, until nothing remained.\r\n\r\nA fresh start was made at 7.30 P.M. and a wretched, trying night was\r\nspent, when we marched without a break for twelve and a half hours.\r\nOverhead there was a dense pall of nimbus from which snow fell at\r\nintervals. None of the dogs except Ginger gave any help with the load,\r\nand Mary was so worn out that she had to be carried on the sledge. Poor\r\nMary had been a splendid dog, but we had to kill her at the camp in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nAfter a run of eighteen and a half miles we halted at 8 A.M. on December\r\n18.\r\n\r\nAt 5.30 P.M. a light south-easter blew and snow fell from an overcast\r\nsky. Soon after a start was made, it became apparent that a descent was\r\ncommencing. In this locality the country had been swept by wind, for\r\nnone of the recent snow settled on the surface. The sastrugi were high\r\nand hard, and over them we bumped, slipping and falling in the uncertain\r\nlight. We could not endure this kind of travelling for long and resolved\r\nto camp shortly after midnight, intending to go on when the day had\r\nadvanced further and the light was stronger.\r\n\r\n\"December 19.--Up at noon and tried a few more miles in the snow-glare.\r\nLater in the afternoon the sky began to break and we picked our way with\r\nless difficulty. Camped at 5 P.M., having done only twelve miles one\r\nthousand and fifty yards since the morning of December 18.\r\n\r\n\"Up at 8 P.M. again, almost calm and sun shining. Still continuing a\r\nwesterly course we dropped several hundred feet, marching over rough,\r\nslippery fields of sastrugi.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early morning hours of the 20th the surface changed to ice and\r\noccasional crevasses appeared. It was clear that we had arrived at the\r\nhead of the Ninnis Glacier above the zone of serac we had traversed\r\non the outward journey. It was very satisfactory to know this; to be\r\ncertain that some landmark had been seen and recognized.\r\n\r\nSoon after this discovery we came near losing Haldane, the big grey\r\nwolf, in a crevasse. Miserably thin from starvation the wretched dogs\r\nno longer filled their harness. As we pulled up Haldane, after he had\r\nbroken into a deep, sheer-walled crevasse, his harness slipped off just\r\nas he reached the top. It was just possible to seize hold of his hair at\r\nthat moment and to land him safely, otherwise we should have lost many\r\ndays' rations.\r\n\r\nHe took to the harness once more but soon became uncertain in his\r\nfootsteps, staggered along and then tottered and fell. Poor brutes! that\r\nwas the way they all gave in--pulling till they dropped.\r\n\r\nWe camped at 4 A.M., thinking that a rest would revive Haldane. Inside\r\nthe tent some snow was thawed, and we drank the water with an addition\r\nof a little primus spirit. A temperature reading showed-1 degree F.\r\n\r\nOutside, the hungry huskies moaned unceasingly until we could bear to\r\nhear them no longer. The tent was struck and we set off once more.\r\n\r\nHaldane was strapped on the sledge as he could not walk. He had not\r\neaten the food we had given him, because his jaws seemed too weak to\r\nbite. He had just nursed it between his paws and licked it.\r\n\r\nBefore the dogs became as weak as this, great care had to be taken in\r\ntethering them at each camp so as to prevent them from gnawing the wood\r\nof the sledge, the straps or, in fact, anything at all. Every time we\r\nwere ready for a fresh start they seemed to regain their old strength,\r\nfor they struggled and fought to seize any scraps, however useless, left\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\nThe day's march was completed at 10.30 A.M. and fourteen and a half\r\nmiles lay behind.\r\n\r\n\"We were up again at 11.20 P.M. Sky clear; fifteen-mile breeze from the\r\nsouth-south-east and the temperature 3 degrees F. By midnight there was\r\na thirty-mile wind and low, flying drift.\r\n\r\n\"December 21.--The night-march was a miserable one. The only thing which\r\nhelped to relieve it was that for a moment Dixson Island was miraged up\r\nin the north, and we felt that we had met an old friend, which means\r\na lot in this icy desolation. The surface was furrowed by hard, sharp\r\nsastrugi.\r\n\r\n\"We camped at 9 A.M. after only eleven miles. Haldane was finished off\r\nbefore we retired.\r\n\r\n\"We were up again at 9 P.M., and when a start was made at 11 P.M. there\r\nwas a strong south-south-east wind blowing, with low drift; temperature,\r\nzero Fahr.\r\n\r\n\"December 22.--The surface of hard, polished sastrugi caused many falls.\r\nThe track was undulating, rising in one case several hundred feet and\r\nfinally falling in a long slope.\r\n\r\n\"Pavlova gave in late in the march and was taken on the sledge.\r\n\r\n\"Camped at 6.40 A.M. in a forty-mile wind with low drift. Distance\r\nmarched was twelve miles one thousand four hundred yards.\r\n\r\n\"Before turning in, we effected sundry repairs. Mertz re-spliced the\r\nhandle of the shovel which had broken apart and I riveted the broken\r\nspindle of the sledge-meter. The mechanism of the latter had frozen\r\nduring the previous day's halt, and, on being started, its spindle had\r\nbroken off short. It was a long and tedious job tapping at the steed\r\nwith a toy hammer, but the rivet held miraculously for the rest of the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\"Up at 11.30 P.M., a moderate breeze blowing, overcast sky, light snow\r\nfalling.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 28 an uphill march commenced which was rendered very heavy\r\nby the depth of the soft snow. Pavlova had to be carried on the sledge.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, gaping crevasses appeared dimly through the falling snow which\r\nsurrounded us like a blanket. There was nothing to do but camp, though\r\nit was only 4.30 A.M., and we had covered but five miles one thousand\r\ntwo hundred and thirty yards.\r\n\r\nPavlova was killed and we made a very acceptable soup from her bones. In\r\nview of the dark outlook, our ration of food had to be still further cut\r\ndown. We had no proper sleep, hunger gnawing at us all the time, and the\r\nquestion of food was for ever in our thoughts. Dozing in the fur bags,\r\nwe dreamed of gorgeous \"spreads\" and dinner-parties at home. Tramping\r\nalong through the snow, we racked our brains thinking of how to make the\r\nmost of the meagre quantity of dogs' meat at hand.\r\n\r\nThe supply of kerosene for the primus stove promised to be ample, for\r\nnone of it had been lost in the accident. We found that it was worth\r\nwhile spending some time in boiling the dogs' meat thoroughly. Thus a\r\ntasty soup was prepared as well as a supply of edible meat in which the\r\nmuscular tissue and the gristle were reduced to the consistency of a\r\njelly. The paws took longest of all to cook, but, treated to lengthy\r\nstewing, they became quite digestible.\r\n\r\nOn December 24 we were up at 8 A.M. just as the sun commenced to gleam\r\nthrough clouds. The light was rather bad, and snow fell as the track\r\nzigzagged about among many crevasses; but suddenly the sun broke forth.\r\nThe sledge was crossing a surface of deep snow which soon became so\r\nsticky that the load would scarcely move. At last a halt was made after\r\nfour miles, and we waited for the evening, when the surface was expected\r\nto harden.\r\n\r\nA small prion visited us but went off in a moment. It is very remarkable\r\nhow far some Antarctic sea-birds may wander inland, apparently at such\r\na great distance from anything which should interest them. We were then\r\nmore than one hundred miles south of the open sea. As the bird flew\r\naway, we watched it until it disappeared in the north, wishing that we\r\ntoo had wings to cross the interminable plateau ahead.\r\n\r\nLying in the sleeping-bag that day I dreamt that I visited a\r\nconfectioner's shop. All the wares that were displayed measured feet in\r\ndiameter. I purchased an enormous delicacy just as one would buy a bun\r\nunder ordinary stances. I remember paying the money over the counter,\r\nbut something happened before I received what I had chosen. When I\r\nrealized the omission I was out in the street, and, being greatly\r\ndisappointed, went back to the shop, but found the door shut and \"early\r\nclosing\" written on it.\r\n\r\nThough a good daily average had been maintained on the march whenever\r\nconditions were at all favourable, the continuance of bad weather\r\nand the undoubtedly weaker state in which we found ourselves made it\r\nimperative to dispense with all but the barest necessities. Thus\r\nthe theodolite was the only instrument retained, and the camera,\r\nphotographic films (exposed and unexposed), hypsometer, thermometers,\r\nrifle, ammunition and other sundries were all thrown away. The frame\r\nof the tent was made lighter by constructing two poles, each four\r\nfeet high, from the telescopic theodolite legs, the heavier pieces of\r\nsledge-runner being discarded.\r\n\r\nWe were up at 11 P.M. on December 24, but so much time was absorbed in\r\nmaking a dog-stew for Christmas that it was not till 2.80 A.M. that we\r\ngot under way. We wished each other happier Christmases in the future,\r\nand divided two scraps of biscuit which I found in my spare kit-bag;\r\nrelics of better days.\r\n\r\nThe surface was a moderately good one of undulating, hard sastrugi, and,\r\nas the course had been altered to north-west, the southerly wind helped\r\nus along. The sun shone brightly, and only for the wind and the low\r\ndrift we might have felt tolerably comfortable. On our right, down\r\nwithin the shallow depression of the Ninnis Glacier, the low outline of\r\nDixson Island, forty miles to the north, could be seen miraged up on the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nThe tent was raised at 9.30 A.M. after a run of eleven miles one hundred\r\nand seventy-six yards. An ounce each of butter was served out from our\r\nsmall stock to give a festive touch to the dog-stew.\r\n\r\nAt noon I took an observation for latitude, and, after taking a bearing\r\non to Dixson Island, computed that the distance in an air-line to Winter\r\nQuarters was one hundred and sixty miles.\r\n\r\n\"December 26.--Got away at 2 A.M.; the surface undulating and hummocky\r\nwith occasional beds of soft snow. Sun shining, wind ranged between\r\nthirty and forty miles per hour with much low drift; cold; camped about\r\nnoon having done ten miles five hundred and twenty-eight yards.\r\n\r\n\"We have reached the western side of the Ninnis Glacier. Ahead are\r\nrising slopes, but we look forward to assistance from the wind in the\r\nascent.\r\n\r\n\"I was again troubled with a touch of snow-blindness, but it responded\r\nto the usual treatment.\r\n\r\n\"At 11 P.M. we were at it again,but what with preparing dog-stew, packing\r\nup within the limited area of the tent and experimenting with a sail, it\r\nwas five hours before the march commenced.\r\n\r\n\"The sail was the tent-cover, attached to the top of one ski lashed\r\nvertically as a mast and secured below to the other ski, lashed across\r\nthe sledge as a boom.\"\r\n\r\nA start was made at 4 A.M. on the 27th in a thirty-mile wind accompanied\r\nby low drift. The surface was smooth but grew unexpectedly soft at\r\nintervals, while the ascent soon began to tell on us. Though the work\r\nwas laborious, notwithstanding some aid from the sail, the bright\r\nsunlight kept up our spirits, and, whenever a halt was called for a few\r\nminutes' spell, the conversation invariably turned upon the subject of\r\nfood and what we should do on arrival on board the 'Aurora'.\r\n\r\nAt noon the sledge-meter showed nine miles one thousand four hundred\r\nyards, and we agreed to halt and pitch camp.\r\n\r\nThe wind had fallen off considerably, and in the brilliant sunshine it\r\nwas comparatively warm in the tent. The addition of the heat from\r\nthe primus stove, kept burning for an unusually long time during the\r\npreparation of the meat, caused a thaw of drift-snow which became lodged\r\non the lee side of the tent. Thus we had frequently to put up with\r\nan unwelcome drip. Moisture came from the floor also, as there was no\r\nfloor-cloth, and the sleeping-bags were soon very wet and soggy. As soon\r\nas the cooking was finished, the tent cooled off and the wet walls froze\r\nand became stiff with icy cakes.\r\n\r\nAt this time we were eating largely of the dogs' meat, to which was\r\nadded one or two ounces of chocolate or raisins, three or four ounces\r\nof pemmican and biscuit mixed together, and, as a beverage, very dilute\r\ncocoa. The total weight of solid food consumed by each man per day was\r\napproximately fourteen ounces. Our small supply of butter and glaxo was\r\nsaved for emergency, while a few tea-bags which remained were boiled\r\nover and over again.\r\n\r\nThe march commenced on December 28 at 3 A.M. in a thirty-mile wind\r\naccompanied by light drift. Overhead there was a wild sky which augured\r\nbadly for the next few days. It was cold work raising the sail, and we\r\nwere glad to be marching.\r\n\r\nOur faithful retainer Ginger could walk no longer and was strapped on\r\nthe sledge. She was the last of the dogs and had been some sort of a\r\nhelp until a few days before. We were sad when it came to finishing her\r\noff.\r\n\r\nOn account of the steep up grade and the weight of Ginger on the sledge,\r\nwe camped at 7.15 A.M. after only four miles one thousand two hundred\r\nand thirty yards.\r\n\r\nWe had breakfast off Ginger's skull and brain. I can never forget the\r\noccasion. As there was nothing available to divide it, the skull was\r\nboiled whole. Then the right and left halves were drawn for by the old\r\nand well-established sledging practice of \"shut-eye,\" after which we\r\ntook it in turns eating to the middle line, passing the skull from one\r\nto the other. The brain was afterwards scooped out with a wooden spoon.\r\n\r\nOn sledging journeys it is usual to apportion all food-stuffs in as\r\nnearly even halves as possible. Then one man turns away and another,\r\npointing to a heap, asks \"Whose?\" The reply from the one not looking is\r\n\"Yours\" or \"Mine\" as the case may be. Thus an impartial and satisfactory\r\ndivision of the rations is made.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal I went on cooking more meat so as to have a supply in\r\nreadiness for eating. It was not till 2 P.M. that the second lot was\r\nfinished. The task was very trying, for I had to sit up on the floor of\r\nthe tent for hours in a cramped position, continually attending to the\r\ncooker, while Mertz in his Sleeping-bag was just accommodated within the\r\nlimited space which remained. The tent was too small either to lie down\r\nduring the operation or to sit up comfortably on a sleeping-bag.\r\n\r\nAt 9.30 P.M. Mertz rose to take a turn at the cooking, and at 11 P.M. I\r\njoined him at \"breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time a kind of daily cycle was noted in the weather. It was\r\nalways calmest between 4 P.M. and 6 P.M. During the evening hours the\r\nwind increased until it reached a maximum between four and six o'clock\r\nnext morning, after which it fell off gradually.\r\n\r\nWe were away at 2.30 A.M. on the 29th in a thirty-mile wind which raised\r\na light drift. The sail was found to be of great assistance over a\r\nsurface which rose in terraces of fifty to one hundred feet in height,\r\noccurring every one to one and a half miles. This march lasted for six\r\nhours, during which we covered seven miles five hundred and twenty-eight\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nOn December 30 the ascent continued and the wind was still in the\r\n\"thirties.\" After several hours we overtopped the last terrace and stood\r\non flat ground--the crest of a ridge.\r\n\r\nTramping over the plateau, where reigns the desolation of the outer\r\nworlds, in solitude at once ominous and weird, one is free to roam in\r\nimagination through the wide realm of human experience to the bounds of\r\nthe great Beyond. One is in the midst of infinities--the infinity of the\r\ndazzling white plateau, the infinity of the dome above, the infinity of\r\nthe time past since these things had birth, and the infinity of the time\r\nto come before they shall have fulfilled the Purpose for which they were\r\ncreated. We, in the midst of the illimitable, could feel with Marcus\r\nAurelius that \"Of life, the time is a point.\"\r\n\r\nBy 9 A.M. we had accomplished a splendid march of fifteen miles three\r\nhundred and fifty yards, but the satisfaction we should have felt at\r\nmaking such an inroad on the huge task before us was damped by the fact\r\nthat I suddenly became aware that Mertz was not as cheerful as usual.\r\nI was at a loss to know the reason, for he was always such a bright and\r\ncompanionable fellow.\r\n\r\nAt 10.15 P.M. the sky had become overcast, snow was falling and a strong\r\nwind was blowing. We decided to wait for better conditions.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Eve at 5.30 A.M. the wind was not so strong, so we got up\r\nand prepared for the start.\r\n\r\nMertz said that he felt the dogs' meat was not doing him much good and\r\nsuggested that we should give it up for a time and eat a small ration\r\nof the ordinary sledging food, of which we had still some days'\r\nsupply carefully husbanded. I agreed to do this and we made our first\r\nexperiment on that day. The ration tasted very sweet compared with dogs'\r\nmeat and was so scanty in amount that it left one painfully empty.\r\n\r\nThe light was so atrocious for marching that, after stumbling along for\r\ntwo and a half miles, we were obliged to give up the attempt and camp,\r\nspending the day in sleeping-bags.\r\n\r\nIn the evening at 9.30 P.M. the sun appeared for a brief moment and the\r\nwind subsided. Another stage was therefore attempted but at considerable\r\ncost, for we staggered along in the bewildering light, continually\r\nfalling over unseen sastrugi. The surface was undulating with a tendency\r\nto down grades. Two sets of sastrugi were found crossing one another,\r\nand, in the absence of the sun, we could not be sure of the course, so\r\nthe camp was pitched niter five miles.\r\n\r\n\"January 1, 1913.--Outside, an overcast sky and falling snow. Mertz was\r\nnot up to his usual form and we decided not to attempt blundering along\r\nin the bad light, believing that the rest would be advantageous to him.\r\n\r\n\"He did not complain at all except of the dampness of his sleeping-bag,\r\nthough when I questioned him particularly he admitted that he had pains\r\nin the abdomen. As I had a continuous gnawing sensation in the stomach,\r\nI took it that he had the same, possibly more acute.\r\n\r\n\"After New Year's Day he expressed a dislike to biscuit, which seemed\r\nrather strange. Then he suddenly had a desire for glaxo and our small\r\nstore was made over to him, I taking a considerable ration of the dogs'\r\nmeat in exchange.\r\n\r\n\"It was no use, however, for when we tried to cover a few more miles\r\nthe exertion told very heavily on him, and it was plain that he was in a\r\nmore serious condition than myself.\r\n\r\n\"January 2.--The same abominable weather. We eat only a few ounces of\r\nchocolate each day.\r\n\r\n\"January 3.--In the evening the sky broke and the sun looked through the\r\nclouds. We were not long in packing up and getting on the way. The night\r\nwas chilly and Mertz got frost-bitten fingers, so camp was pitched after\r\nfour miles one thousand two hundred and thirty yards.\r\n\r\n\"January 4.--The sun was shining and we had intended rising at 10 A.M.,\r\nbut Mertz was not well and thought that the rest would be good for him.\r\nI spent the time improving some of the gear, mending Mertz's clothing\r\nand cooking a quantity of the meat.\r\n\r\n\"January 5.--The sky was overcast, snow was falling, and there was\r\na strong wind. Mertz suggested that as the conditions were so bad we\r\nshould delay another day.\r\n\r\n\"Lying in the damp bags was wretched and was not doing either of us any\r\ngood, but what was to be done? Outside, the conditions were abominable.\r\nMy companion was evidently weaker than I, and it was apparently quite\r\ntrue that he was not making much of the dogs' meat.\r\n\r\n\"January 6.--A better day but the sky remained overcast. Mertz agreed to\r\ntry another stage.\"\r\n\r\nThe grade was slightly downhill and the wind well behind. Unfortunately\r\nthe surface was slippery and irregular and falls were frequent. These\r\ntold very much upon my companion until, after consistently demurring,\r\nhe at last consented to ride on the sledge. With the wind blowing behind\r\nus, it required no great exertion to bring the load along, though it\r\nwould often pull up suddenly against sastrugi. After we had covered two\r\nand a half miles, Mertz became so cold through inaction in the wind that\r\nthere was nothing to do but pitch the tent.\r\n\r\nMertz appeared to be depressed and, after the short meal, sank back into\r\nhis bag without saying much. Occasionally, during the day, I would ask\r\nhim how he felt, or we would return to the old subject of food. It\r\nwas agreed that on our arrival on board the 'Aurora' Mertz was to make\r\npenguin omelettes, for we had never forgotten the excellence of those we\r\nhad eaten just before leaving the Hut.\r\n\r\nReviewing the situation, I found that we were one hundred miles\r\nsouth-east of Winter Quarters where food and plenty awaited us. At\r\nthe time we had still ordinary rations for several days. How short a\r\ndistance it would seem to the vigorous, but what a lengthy journey for\r\nthe weak and famished!\r\n\r\nThe skin was peeling off our bodies and a very poor substitute remained\r\nwhich burst readily and rubbed raw in many places. One day, I remember,\r\nMertz ejaculated, \"Just a moment,\" and, reaching over, lifted from my\r\near a perfect skin-cast. I was able to do the same for him. As we never\r\ntook off our clothes, the peelings of hair and skin from our bodies\r\nworked down into our under-trousers and socks, and regular clearances\r\nwere made.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening of the 6th I made the following note in my diary:\r\n\r\n\"A long and wearisome night. If only I could get on; but I must stop\r\nwith Xavier. He does not appear to be improving and both our chances are\r\ngoing now.\"\r\n\r\n\"January 7.--Up at 8 A.M., it having been arranged last night that we\r\nwould go on to-day at all costs, sledge-sailing, with Xavier in his bag\r\non the sledge.\" It was a sad blow to me to find that Mertz was in a weak\r\nstate and required helping in and out of his bag. He needed rest for a\r\nfew hours at least before he could think of travelling. \"I have to turn\r\nin again to kill time and also to keep warm, for I feel the cold very\r\nmuch now.\"\r\n\r\n\"At 10 A.M. I get up to dress Xavier and prepare food, but find him in a\r\nkind of fit.\" Coming round a few minutes later, he exchanged a few words\r\nand did not seem to realize that anything had happened. \"... Obviously\r\nwe can't go on to-day. It is a good day though the light is bad, the\r\nsun just gleaming through the clouds. This is terrible; I don't mind for\r\nmyself but for others. I pray to God to help us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cook some thick cocoa for Xavier and give him beef-tea; he is better\r\nafter noon, but very low--I have to lift him up to drink.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon he had several more fits, then became delirious and\r\ntalked incoherently until midnight, when he appeared to fall off into a\r\npeaceful slumber. So I toggled up the sleeping-bag and retired worn out\r\ninto my own. After a couple of hours, having felt no movement from my\r\ncompanion, I stretched out an arm and found that he was stiff.\r\n\r\nMy comrade had been accepted into \"the peace that passeth all\r\nunderstanding.\" It was my fervent hope that he had been received where\r\nsterling qualities and a high mind reap their due reward. In his life we\r\nloved him; he was a man of character, generous and of noble parts.\r\n\r\nFor hours I lay in the bag, rolling over in my mind all that lay behind\r\nand the chance of the future. I seemed to stand alone on the wide shores\r\nof the world--and what a short step to enter the unknown future!\r\n\r\nMy physical condition was such that I felt I might collapse in a moment.\r\nThe gnawing in the stomach had developed there a permanent weakness, so\r\nthat it was not possible to hold myself up in certain positions. Several\r\nof my toes commenced to blacken and fester near the tips and the nails\r\nworked loose.\r\n\r\nOutside, the bowl of chaos was brimming with drift-snow and I wondered\r\nhow I would manage to break and pitch camp single-handed. There appeared\r\nto be little hope of reaching the Hut. It was easy to sleep on in the\r\nbag, and the weather was cruel outside. But inaction is hard to brook,\r\nand I thought of Service's lines:\r\n\r\n    Buck up, do your damndest and fight,\r\n    It's the plugging away that will win you the day.\r\n\r\nIf I failed to reach the Hut it would be something done to reach some\r\nprominent point likely to catch the eye of a search party, where a cairn\r\nmight be erected and our diaries cached. And so I commenced to modify\r\nthe sledge and camping gear to meet fresh requirements.\r\n\r\nThe sky remained clouded, but the wind fell off to a calm which lasted\r\nfor several hours. I took the opportunity to set to work on the sledge,\r\nsawing it in halves with a pocket tool. A mast was made out of one of\r\nthe rails of the discarded half of the sledge and a spar was cut\r\nfrom the other rail. The sledge-meter, very much battered, was\r\nstill serviceable. Lastly, the load was cut down to a minimum by the\r\nelimination of all but the barest necessities.\r\n\r\nLate on the evening of the 8th I took the body of Mertz, wrapped up\r\nin his sleeping-bag, outside the tent, piled snow blocks around it and\r\nraised a rough cross made of the two half-runners of the sledge.\r\n\r\nOn January 9 the weather was overcast and fairly thick drift was flying\r\nin a wind reaching about fifty miles an hour. As certain matters still\r\nrequired attention and my chances of re-erecting the tent were rather\r\ndoubtful, if I had decided to move on, the start was delayed.\r\n\r\n\"I read the Burial Service over Xavier this afternoon. As there is\r\nlittle chance of my reaching human aid alive. I greatly regret inability\r\nat the moment to set out the detail of coastline met with for three\r\nhundred miles travelled and observations of glacier and ice-formations,\r\netc.; the most of which latter are, of course, committed to my head.\r\n\r\n\"The approximate location of the camp is latitude 68 degrees 2' S.,\r\nlongitude 145 degrees 9' E. This is dead reckoning, as the theodolite\r\nlegs have been out of action for some time, splinted together to form\r\ntent-props. I believe the truth lies nearer latitude 67 degrees 57' S.,\r\nlongitude 145 degrees 20' E., as the wind must have drifted us to the\r\nnorth.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon I cut up Mertz's burberry jacket and roughly sewed\r\nit to a large canvas clothes-bag, making a sail which could be readily\r\nset or furled, so as to save delay in starting out or in camping.\r\n\r\nJanuary 10 was an impossible day for travelling on account of thick\r\ndrift and high wind. I spent part of the time in reckoning up the amount\r\nof food remaining and in cooking the rest of the dogs' meat; the last\r\ndevice enabling me to leave behind some of the kerosene, of which there\r\nwas still a good supply. Late in the afternoon the wind fell and the\r\nsun peered amongst the clouds just as I was in the middle of a long job\r\nriveting and lashing the broken shovel.\r\n\r\nIt was on January 11--a beautiful, calm day of sunshine--that I set out\r\nover a good surface with a slight down grade. From the start my feet\r\nfelt lumpy and sore. They had become so painful after a mile of walking\r\nthat I decided to make an examination of them on the spot, sitting in\r\nthe sun on the sledge. The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for\r\nthe thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete\r\nlayer, and abundant watery fluid had escaped into the socks. The new\r\nskin underneath was very much abraded and raw.\r\n\r\nI did what appeared to be the best thing under the stances: smeared\r\nthe new skin with lanoline, of which there was a good store, and with\r\nbandages bound the skin soles back in place, as they were comfortable\r\nand soft in contact with the raw surfaces. Outside the bandages I wore\r\nsix pairs of thick woollen socks, fur boots and a crampon over-shoe\r\nof soft leather. Then I removed most of my clothing and bathed in\r\nthe glorious heat of the sun. A tingling sensation seemed to spread\r\nthroughout my whole body, and I felt stronger and better.\r\n\r\nWhen the day commenced with ideal weather I thought I would cover a\r\nlong distance, but at 5.30 P.M., after six and a quarter miles, I felt\r\nnerve-worn and had to camp, \"so worn that had it not been a delightful\r\nevening, I should not have found strength to erect the tent.\"\r\n\r\nThough the medical outfit was limited, there were a fair number of\r\nbandages and on camping I devoted much time to tending raw patches all\r\nover the body, festering fingers and inflamed nostrils.\r\n\r\nHigh wind and much drift put travelling out of the question on January\r\n12, and in any case my feet needed a rest.\r\n\r\n\"January 13.--The wind subsided and the snow cleared off at noon. The\r\nafternoon was beautifully fine. Descended hard ice-slopes over many\r\ncrevasses--almost all descent--but surface cut my feet up; at 8 P.M.\r\ncamped, having done five and three-quarter miles--painful feet--on\r\ncamping find feet worse than ever; things look bad but shall persevere.\r\nIt is now 11 P.M. and the glacier is firing off like artillery--appears\r\nto send up great jets of imprisoned air.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the march Aurora Peak showed up to the west, about twenty miles\r\naway, across the Mertz Glacier. I felt happy at thus fixing my position,\r\nand at the sight of the far plateau which led onwards to Winter\r\nQuarters.\r\n\r\nThe glacier was the next obstacle to advance. To the south-west it\r\ndescended from the plateau in immense broken folds. Pressing northward\r\nit was torn into the jumbled crush of serac-ice, sparkling beneath\r\nan unclouded sun. The idea of diverging to the west and rounding the\r\nice-falls occurred to me, but the detours involved other difficulties,\r\nso I strove to pick out the best track across the valley.\r\n\r\nA high wind which blew on the morning of the 14th diminished in strength\r\nby noon and allowed me to get away. The sun was so warm that the\r\npuckered ice underfoot was covered with a film of water and in some\r\nplaces small trickles ran away to disappear into crevasses.\r\n\r\nThough the course was downhill to the Mertz Glacier, the sledge required\r\na good deal of pulling owing to the wet runners. At 9 P.M., after\r\ntravelling five miles, I pitched camp in the bed of the glacier.\r\n\r\nBetween 9.30 P.M. and 11 P.M. the \"cannonading\" heard on the previous\r\nnight recommenced. The sounds, resembling the explosions of heavy guns,\r\nusually started higher up the glacier and ended down towards the sea.\r\nWhen I first heard them, I put my head outside the tent to see what was\r\ngoing on. The reports came at random from every direction, but there was\r\nno visible evidence as to how they were produced. Without a doubt they\r\nhad something to do with the re-freezing and splitting of the ice owing\r\nto the evening chill; but the sounds seemed far too loud to be explained\r\nby this cause alone.\r\n\r\nJanuary 15--the date on which all the summer sledging parties were due\r\nat the Hut! It was overcast and snowing early in the day, and in a few\r\nhours the sun broke out and shone warmly. The travelling was so heavy\r\nover a soft snowy surface, partly melting, that I gave up, after one\r\nmile, and camped.\r\n\r\nAt 7 P.M. the surface had not improved, the sky was thickly obscured and\r\nsnow fell. At 10 P.M. the snow was coming down heavily, and, since there\r\nwere many crevasses in the vicinity, I resolved to wait.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th at 2 A.M. the snow was as thick as ever, but at 5 A.M. the\r\natmosphere lightened and the sun appeared.\r\n\r\nWithout delay I broke camp. A favourable breeze sprang up, and with sail\r\nset I managed to proceed through the snowy \"deluge\" in short stages. The\r\nsnow clung in lumps to the runners, which had to be scraped frequently.\r\nI passed some broken ridges and sank into several holes leading down to\r\ncrevasses out of which it was possible to scramble easily.\r\n\r\nAfter laboriously toiling up one long slope, I was just catching my\r\nbreath at the top and the sledge was running easily when I noticed\r\nthat the surface beneath my feet fell away steeply in front. I suddenly\r\nrealized that I was on the brink of a great blue hole like a quarry. The\r\nsledge was following of its own accord and was rapidly gaining speed,\r\nso I turned and, exerting every effort, was just able to hold it back\r\nby means of the hauling-line from the edge of the abyss. I should think\r\nthat there must have been an interval of quite a minute during which I\r\nheld my ground without being able to make it budge. Then it slowly came\r\nmy way, and the imminent danger was past.\r\n\r\nThe day's march was an extremely hard five miles. Before turning in\r\nI had an extra supper of jelly soup, made by boiling down some of the\r\ndogs' sinews, strengthened with a little pemmican. The acute enjoyment\r\nof eating under these circumstances compensates in a slight measure for\r\nthe suffering of starvation.\r\n\r\nJanuary 17 was another day of overcast weather and falling snow. Delay\r\nmeant a reduction in the ration which was low enough already, so there\r\nwas nothing to do but go on.\r\n\r\nWhen I got away at 8 A.M. I found that the pulling was easier than it\r\nhad been on the previous day. Nevertheless I covered only two miles and\r\nhad to consider myself fortunate in not winding up the whole story then\r\nand there. This is what happened, following the account in my diary.\r\n\r\n\"Going up a long, fairly steep slope, deeply covered with soft snow,\r\nbroke through lid of crevasse but caught myself at thighs, got out,\r\nturned fifty yards to the north, then attempted to cross trend of\r\ncrevasse, there being no indication of it; a few moments later found\r\nmyself dangling fourteen feet below on end of rope in crevasse--sledge\r\ncreeping to mouth--had time to say to myself, 'so this is the end,'\r\nexpecting the sledge every moment to crash on my head and all to go to\r\nthe unseen bottom--then thought of the food uneaten on the sledge; but\r\nas the sledge pulled up without letting me down, thought of Providence\r\ngiving me another chance.\" The chance was very small considering my\r\nweak condition. The width of the crevasse was about six feet, so I hung\r\nfreely in space, turning slowly round.\r\n\r\nA great effort brought a knot in the rope within my grasp, and, after a\r\nmoment's rest, I was able to draw myself up and reach another, and, at\r\nlength, hauled myself on to the overhanging snow-lid into which the rope\r\nhad cut. Then, when I was carefully climbing out on to the surface, a\r\nfurther section of the lid gave way, precipitating me once more to the\r\nfull length of the rope.\r\n\r\nExhausted, weak and chilled (for my hands were bare and pounds of snow\r\nhad got inside my clothing) I hung with the firm conviction that all was\r\nover except the passing. Below was a black chasm; it would be but the\r\nwork of a moment to slip from the harness, then all the pain and toil\r\nwould be over. It was a rare situation, a rare temptation--a chance to\r\nquit small things for great--to pass from the petty exploration of a\r\nplanet to the contemplation of vaster worlds beyond. But there was all\r\neternity for the last and, at its longest, the present would be but\r\nshort. I felt better for the thought.\r\n\r\nMy strength was fast ebbing; in a few minutes it would be too late. It\r\nwas the occasion for a supreme attempt. New power seemed to come as I\r\naddressed myself to one last tremendous effort. The struggle occupied\r\nsome time, but by a miracle I rose slowly to the surface. This time I\r\nemerged feet first, still holding on to the rope, and pushed myself out,\r\nextended at full length, on the snow--on solid ground. Then came the\r\nreaction, and I could do nothing for quite an hour.\r\n\r\nThe tent was erected in slow stages and I then had a little food. Later\r\non I lay in the sleeping-bag, thinking things over. It was a time when\r\nthe mood of the Persian philosopher appealed to me:\r\n\r\n    Unborn To-morrow and dead Yesterday,\r\n    Why fret about them if To-day be sweet?\r\n\r\nI was confronted with this problem: whether it was better to enjoy life\r\nfor a few days, sleeping and eating my fill until the provisions gave\r\nout, or to \"plug on\" again in hunger with the prospect of plunging at\r\nany moment into eternity without the great luxury and pleasure of food.\r\nAnd then an idea presented itself which greatly improved my prospects.\r\nIt was to construct a ladder from alpine rope; one end of which was to\r\nbe secured to the bow of the sledge and the other to be carried over\r\nmy left shoulder and loosely attached to the sledge harness. Thus, if\r\nI fell into a crevasse again, it would be easy for me, even though\r\nweakened by starvation, to scramble out again by the ladder, provided\r\nthe sledge was not also engulphed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the possibilities of the rope ladder, I could not sleep\r\nproperly at all; my nerves had been so overtaxed. All night considerable\r\nwind and drift continued.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th it was overcast and light snow was falling. I resolved \"to\r\ngo ahead and leave the rest to Providence.\"\r\n\r\nAs they wallowed through the deep snow my feet and legs kept breaking\r\nthrough into space. Then I went right under, but the sledge was held\r\nback and the ladder \"proved trumps.\" A few minutes later I was down\r\nagain, but I emerged again without much exertion, half-smothered with\r\nsnow. Faintness overcame me and I stopped to camp, though only a short\r\ndistance had been covered.\r\n\r\nAll around me was a leaden glare, the snow clouds \"corralling\" me in.\r\nThe sun had not shown up for some days and I was eager to see it once\r\nmore, not only that it might show up the landscape, but for its cheerful\r\ninfluence and life-giving energy. A few days previously my condition had\r\nbeen improving, but now it was going back.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 18th loud booming noises, sharp cracks and\r\nmuffled growls issued form the neighbouring crevasses and kept waking\r\nme up. At times one could feel a vibration accompanying the growling\r\nsounds, and I concluded that the ice was in rapid motion.\r\n\r\nThe sun at last appeared on the 19th, and I was off by 8.30 A.M. The\r\nwhole surface was a network of crevasses, some very wide. Along one\r\nafter another of these I dragged the sledge until a spot was reached\r\nwhere the snow-bridge looked to be firm. Here I plunged across, risking\r\nthe consequences.\r\n\r\nAfter three hours' marching nothing serious had happened and I found\r\nmyself on safer ground with a \"pimply\" surface visible ahead, close\r\nunder the slopes of the highlands. Once on this I became over-reliant,\r\nand in consequence sank several times into narrow fissures.\r\n\r\nAt 1 P.M. the Mertz Glacier was at last crossed and I had reached the\r\nrising hills on its western side. Overlooking the camp, five hundred\r\nfeet above the glacier, were beetling, crevassed crags, but I could\r\ntrace out a good road, free from pitfalls, leading to the plateau, at an\r\nelevation of three thousand feet.\r\n\r\nTo lighten my load for the climb I threw away alpine rope, finnesko\r\ncrampons, sundry pairs of worn crampons and socks, while I rubbed a\r\ncomposition on the sledge-runners which prevented them from sticking to\r\nwet snow.\r\n\r\nJanuary 20 was a wretched day; overcast, with wind and light drift.\r\nIn desperation I got away at 2 P.M. in a wind which proved to be of\r\nconsiderable assistance. I could see nothing of my surroundings; one\r\nthing was certain, and that was that the ascent had commenced and every\r\nfoot took me upward. The day's work amounted to about two and a half\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st the sun shone brightly and there was a good following wind.\r\nThrough deep snow I zigzagged up for three miles before deciding to\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nWind and drift prevailed early on the 22nd but fell away towards noon,\r\nand I was then favoured with a glorious sunny day. Away to the north\r\nwas a splendid view of the open sea; it looked so beautiful and friendly\r\nthat I longed to be down near it. Six miles had been covered during\r\nthe day, but I felt very weak towards the end on account of the heavy\r\npulling.\r\n\r\nDuring the early hours of the 23rd the sun was visible, but about 8 A.M.\r\nthe clouds sagged low, the wind rose and everything became blotted out\r\nin a swirl of driving snow.\r\n\r\nI wandered on through it for several hours, the sledge capsizing at\r\ntimes owing to the strength of the wind. It was not possible to keep an\r\naccurate course, for even the wind changed direction as the day wore\r\non. Underfoot there was soft snow which I found comfortable for my sore\r\nfeet, but which made the sledge drag heavily at times.\r\n\r\nWhen camp was pitched at 4 P.M. I reckoned that the distance covered in\r\na straight line had been three and a half miles.\r\n\r\nErecting the tent single-handed in the high wind was a task which\r\nrequired much patience and some skill. The poles were erected first\r\nand then the tent was gathered up in the proper form and taken to the\r\nwindward side of the legs where it was weighted down. The flounce on the\r\nwindward side was got into position and piled up with snow blocks. Other\r\nblocks of snow had previously been placed in a ring round the legs in\r\nreadiness to be tumbled on to the rest of the flounce when the tent was\r\nquickly slipped over the apex of the poles. In very windy weather it was\r\noften as much as two hours after halting before I would be cosy within\r\nthe shelter of the tent.\r\n\r\nHigh wind and dense driving snow persisted throughout the 24th and I\r\nmade five and a half miles, sitting on the sledge most of the time with\r\nthe sail up.\r\n\r\nThe blizzard continued on the 25th, but after the trying experience of\r\nthe previous two days, I did not feel well enough to go on. Outside, the\r\nsnow fell in \"torrents,\" piled up round the tent and pressed in until it\r\nwas no bigger than a coffin, of which it reminded me.\r\n\r\nI passed most of the day doctoring myself, attending to raw and inflamed\r\nplaces. Tufts of my beard and hair came out, and the snowy floor of the\r\ntent was strewn with it at every camp.\r\n\r\n\"January 26.--I went on again in dense, driving snow. There was no need\r\nof the sail. The wind, which was behind, caught the sledge and bundled\r\nit along so that, though over a soft surface of snow, the travelling was\r\nrapid. The snow was in large, rounded grains, and beat on the tent like\r\nhail. Altogether nine miles were covered.\r\n\r\n\"January 27.--Blizzard-bound again. The previous day's exertions were\r\ntoo much for me to undertake the same again without a long rest.\r\n\r\n\"January 28,--In the morning the wind had moderated very much but the\r\nsky remained overcast and snow continued to fall. It was a long job\r\ndigging the tent out. Soon after the start the sun gleamed and the\r\nweather improved. The three-thousand-foot crest of the plateau had been\r\ncrossed and I was bearing down rapidly on Commonwealth Bay, the vicinity\r\nof which showed up as a darker patch on the clouds of the north-west\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n\"The evening was fine and I really began to feel that Winter Quarters\r\nwere approaching. To increase my excitement Madigan Nunatak came into\r\nview for a time in the clear, evening light. Distance covered, over\r\neight miles.\"\r\n\r\nThe calm of the previous evening was broken again, and I started on the\r\nmorning of January 29 in considerable drift and a fairly strong wind.\r\nAfter going five miles I had miraculous good fortune.\r\n\r\nI was travelling along on an even down grade and was wondering how long\r\nthe two pounds of food which remained would last, when something dark\r\nloomed through the drift a short distance away to the right. All sorts\r\nof possibilities fled through my mind as I headed the sledge for it. The\r\nunexpected happened--it was a cairn of snow erected by McLean, Hodgeman\r\nand Hurley, who had been out searching for us. On the top of the mound\r\nwas a bag of food, left on the chance that it might be picked up, while\r\nin a tin was a note stating the bearing and distance of the mound from\r\nAladdin's Cave (E. 30 degrees S., distance twenty-three miles), that the\r\nShip had arrived at the Hut and was waiting, that Amundsen had reached\r\nthe Pole, and that Scott was remaining another year in Antarctica.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a singular fact that the search party only left this mound\r\nat eight o'clock on the morning of that very day (January 29). It was\r\nabout 2 P.M. when I found it. Thus, during the night of the 28th, our\r\ncamps had been only about five miles apart.\r\n\r\nWith plenty of food, I speedily felt stimulated and revived, and\r\nanticipated reaching the Hut in a day or two, for there was then not\r\nmore than twenty-three miles to cover. Alas, however, there was to be\r\nanother delay. I was without crampons--they had been thrown away on the\r\nwestern side of Mertz Glacier--and in the strong wind was not able to\r\nstand up on the slippery ice of the coastal slopes. The result was that\r\nI sat on the sledge and ran along with the wind, nibbling at the food\r\nas I went. The sledge made so much leeway that near the end of the day,\r\nafter fourteen miles, I reckoned that I had been carried to the east of\r\nAladdin's Cave. The course was therefore changed to the west, but the\r\nwind came down almost broadside-on to the sledge, and it was swept away.\r\nThe only thing to do was to camp.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th I cut up the box of the theodolite and into two pieces\r\nof wood stuck as many screws and tacks as I could procure from the\r\nsledge-meter. In the repair-bag there were still a few ice-nails which\r\nat this time were of great use. Late in the day the wind fell off, and\r\nI started westward over the ice-slopes with the pieces of nail-studded\r\nwood lashed to my feet.\r\n\r\nAfter six miles these improvised crampons broke up, and the increasing\r\nwind got me into difficulties. Finally, the sledge slipped sideways into\r\na narrow crevasse and was caught by the boom (which crossed from side to\r\nside at the lower part of the mast). I was not strong enough for the job\r\nof extricating it straight away, and by the time I had got it safely on\r\nthe ice, the wind had increased still more. So I pitched camp.\r\n\r\nThe blizzard was in full career on January 31 and I spent all day and\r\nuntil late at night trying to make the crampons serviceable, but without\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nOn February 1 the wind and drift subsided late in the afternoon, and I\r\nclearly saw to the west the beacon which marked Aladdin's Cave.\r\n\r\nAt 7 P.M. I reached this haven within the ice, and never again was I to\r\nhave the ordeal of pitching the tent. Inside the cave were three oranges\r\nand a pineapple which had been brought from the Ship. It was wonderful\r\nonce more to be in the land of such things!\r\n\r\nI waited to mend one of the crampons and then started off for the Hut;\r\nbut a blizzard had commenced. To descend the five miles of steep icy\r\nslopes with my miserable crampons, in the weak state in which I found\r\nmyself, would only have been as a last resort. So I camped in the\r\ncomfortable cave and hoped for better weather next day.\r\n\r\nThe high wind, rising to a hurricane at times, continued for a whole\r\nweek with dense drift until the 8th. I spent the long hours making\r\ncrampons of a new pattern, eating and sleeping. Eventually I became so\r\nanxious that I used to sit outside the cave for long spells, watching\r\nfor a lull in the wind.\r\n\r\nAt length I resolved to go down in the blizzard, sitting on the sledge\r\nas long as possible, blown along by the wind. I was making preparations\r\nfor a start when the wind suddenly decreased and my opportunity had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of hours I was within one mile and a half of the Hut. There\r\nwas no sign of the Ship lying in the offing, but I comforted myself\r\nwith the thought that she might be still at the anchorage and have swung\r\ninshore so as to be hidden by the ice-cliffs, or on the other hand that\r\nCaptain Davis might have been along the coast to the east searching\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBut even as I gazed about seeking for a clue, a speck on the north-west\r\nhorizon caught my eye and my hopes went down. It looked like a distant\r\nship; it might well have been the 'Aurora'. Well, what matter! the long\r\njourney was at an end-a terrible chapter of my life was finished!\r\n\r\nThen the rocks around Winter Quarters began to come into view, part\r\nof the basin of the boat harbour appeared, and lo! there were human\r\nfigures! They almost seemed unreal--I was in a dream--but after a brief\r\nmoment one of them saw me and waved an arm, I replied, there was a\r\ncommotion and they all ran towards the Hut. Then they were lost, for\r\nthe crest of the first steep slope hid them. It almost seemed to me that\r\nthey had run away to hide.\r\n\r\nMinutes passed, and I slowly went along with the sledge. Then a head\r\nrose over the brow of the hill and there was Bickerton, breathless after\r\na long run. I expect he considered for a while which one of us it was.\r\nSoon we had shaken hands and he knew all in a few brief words, and I\r\nlearned that the Ship had left earlier in the day. Madigan, McLean,\r\nBage and Hodgeman arrived, and then a new-comer--Jeffryes. Five men had\r\nremained behind to make a search for our party, and Jeffryes was a new\r\nwireless operator brought down by Captain Davis.\r\n\r\nWe were soon at the Hut where I found that full preparations had been\r\nmade for wintering a second year. The weather was calm and the Ship was\r\nno distance away so I decided to recall her by wireless. The masts at\r\nthe Hut had been re-erected during the summer, and on board the 'Aurora'\r\nHannam was provided with a wireless receiving set. Jeffryes had arranged\r\nwith Hannam to call up at 8, 9 and 10 P.M. for several evenings while\r\nthe 'Aurora' was \"within range\" in case there were any news of my party.\r\nA message recalling the Ship was therefore sent off and repeated at\r\nfrequent intervals till past midnight.\r\n\r\nNext morning there was a forty-mile wind when we went outside, but away\r\nacross Commonwealth Bay to the west the 'Aurora' could be seen close to\r\nthe face of the ice-cliffs. She had returned in response to the call and\r\nwas steaming up and down, waiting for the wind to moderate.\r\n\r\nWe immediately set to work getting all the records, instruments and\r\npersonal gear ready to be taken down to the boat harbour in anticipation\r\nof calm weather during the day.\r\n\r\nThe wind chose to continue and towards evening was in the sixties, while\r\nthe barometer fell. During the afternoon Hodgeman went across to the\r\nwestern ridge and saw that the Ship was still in the Bay. The sea was so\r\nheavy that the motor-boat could never have lived through it.\r\n\r\nThat night Jeffryes sent another message, which we learned afterwards\r\nwas not received, in which Captain Davis was given the option of\r\nremaining until calm weather supervened or of leaving at once for the\r\nWestern Base. I felt that the decision should be left to him, as he\r\ncould appreciate exactly the situation of the Western Base and what the\r\nShip could be expected to do amid the ice at that season of the year.\r\nThe time was already past when, according to my written instructions\r\nleft for him on arrival at Commonwealth Bay, the 'Aurora' should sail\r\nwest to relieve Wild and his party.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 10th there was no sign of the Ship and evidently\r\nCaptain Davis had decided to wait no longer, knowing that further delay\r\nwould endanger the chances of picking up the eight men who had elected\r\nto winter on the shelf-ice one thousand five hundred miles to the\r\nwest. At such a critical moment determination, fearless and swift, was\r\nnecessary, and, in coming to his momentous decision, Captain Davis acted\r\nwell and for the best interests of the Expedition.\r\n\r\nA long voyage lay before the 'Aurora' through many miles of ice-strewn\r\nsea, swept by intermittent blizzards and shrouded now in midnight\r\ndarkness. We still fostered the hope that the vessel's coal-supply would\r\nbe sufficient for her to return to Adelie Land and make an attempt to\r\npick us up. But it was not to be.\r\n\r\nThe long Antarctic winter was fast approaching and we turned to meet it\r\nwith resolution, knowing that if the 'Aurora' failed us in early March,\r\nthat the early summer of the same year would bring relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV THE QUEST OF THE SOUTH MAGNETIC POLE\r\n\r\nDr. R. BAGE\r\n\r\n    Send me your strongest, those who never fail.\r\n    I'm the Blizzard, King of the Southern Trail!\r\n                                       Sledging song.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of November 10, at Aladdin's Cave, after a convivial\r\nhoosh, Webb, Hurley and I said good-bye to Dr. Mawson's party and\r\nmade off south for the eleven and three-quarter mile cave where our\r\nSupporting Party, Murphy, Hunter and Laseron, were waiting for us. At\r\n7 P.M. we started almost at a run over the smooth ice, to the\r\naccompaniment of hearty cheers from Dr. Mawson, Ninnis, and Mertz; two\r\nof whom we were never to see again.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile of this easy going, and we were on snow for the first time\r\nwith a loaded sledge. Uphill snow, too, and the wind rising, so it was\r\nno small relief when we finally made the Cathedral Grotto at 11.30 P.M.,\r\nand found Murphy's tent pitched alongside it. The wind by this time\r\nwas about forty-five miles per hour and, it being nearly dusk, the\r\ncrevasses--a five-mile belt--had been fairly difficult to negotiate.\r\n\r\nWe soon had the cave clear of snow, had a good meal and then slept\r\nthe sleep of the just, feeling well content with the first day's\r\nwork--eleven and a half miles from home at an altitude of one thousand\r\nnine hundred feet. We were off at last on a search for the Magnetic\r\nPole.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow some time was spent in rearranging the loads. Finally,\r\nboth parties moved off south into heavy wind and fairly thick drift.\r\nWhat with the ground rising steadily, the pressure of the wind and our\r\nlack of condition, two and a quarter hours of solid work realized only\r\ntwo and a quarter miles; so we decided to camp.\r\n\r\nAll the night it blew hard, between seventy and eighty miles per hour,\r\nand next day it was still blowing and drifting heavily. Our tent was\r\na good deal smaller than Murphy's, and, as Webb and Hurley are\r\nboth six-footers, we always had to put all gear outside when the\r\nsleeping-bags were down. This is really a good thing when the weather is\r\nbad, as one is not tempted to stay in the bag all the time.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon as we were all feeling hungry and had been in\r\nbags long enough to feel cold, although the weather was quite warm (10\r\ndegrees F.), we rolled bags, and, when our frozen burberrys were once\r\nfairly on, quite enjoyed ourselves. After a boil-up and a few minutes'\r\n\"run\" round in the drift and wind, we did some stitching on our light\r\ndrill tent, which was making very heavy weather of it, although pitched\r\nclose under the lee of Murphy's strong japara tent. A little reading,\r\nsome shouted unintelligible conversation with the other tent, another\r\nboil-up, and, last but not least, a smoke, found us quite ready for\r\nanother sleep.\r\n\r\nNext day (November 13), the wind having dropped to thirty-five miles\r\nper hour, we set out about 11 A.M. in light drift. The sky was still\r\novercast, so the light was very trying. In the worst fogs at home one\r\ncan at any rate see something of the ground on which one is treading;\r\nin Adelie Land, even when the air was clear of snow, it was easy to bump\r\nagainst a four-foot sastruga without seeing it. It always reminded me\r\nmost of a fog at sea: a ship creeping \"o'er the hueless, viewless deep.\"\r\n\r\nWhen 6 P.M. arrived we had only covered five and a half miles, but\r\nwere all thoroughly exhausted and glad to camp. Lunch had been rather\r\nbarbarously served in the lee of the sledge. First came plasmon biscuit,\r\nbroken with the ice-axe into pieces small enough to go into the mouth\r\nthrough the funnel of a burberry helmet; then followed two ounces of\r\nchocolate, frozen rather too hard to have a definite taste; and finally\r\na luscious morsel--two ounces of butter, lovingly thawed-out in the\r\nmouth to get the full flavour. Lunches like these in wind and drift are\r\nuncomfortable enough for every one to be eager to start again as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBy nine o'clock that night the wind had increased to a full gale. We\r\nwere in camp all the 14th and the 15th, the wind rising to eighty-five\r\nmiles per hour with very heavy drift during the small hours of the 15th.\r\nThis was its maximum, and by the afternoon it was down to about seventy\r\nmiles per hour with a clear sky and light drift. We donned our burberrys\r\n(I should like to give Hurley's \"Ode to a Frozen Burberry\") and dug out\r\nour sledges, both of which were completely buried in a ramp forty yards\r\nlong; the shovel projecting nine inches above the surface.\r\n\r\nWhile we were engaged on this work, I overheard the following\r\nconversation being shouted in the Supporting Party's tent:\r\n\r\nFIRST VOICE. I'm hungry. Who will go out and get the food-bag?\r\n\r\nSLEEPY VOICE. The food-weights ** are in the cooker.\r\n\r\nFIRST VOICE. No they're not.\r\n\r\nSLEEPY VOICE. Saw them there yesterday, must be somewhere in the tent.\r\n\r\nFIRST VOICE. No they're not... I ate them last night.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** Until amounts were known by experience, rations were weighed by a\r\nsmall balance whose various weights were small calico bags filled with\r\nchocolate.\r\n\r\nThe exercise, a good hoosh and above all the clear sky made us take a\r\nless morbid view of the fact that we were six days out from the Hut and\r\nonly nineteen and a half miles away.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 16th we could hear above the roar of the wind the drift\r\nstill hissing against the tent, but it had diminished by nine o'clock\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nBy common consent it was agreed that our loads were too heavy for the\r\nconditions under which we were working. I accordingly decided to drop\r\none hundred-pound bag. We had already saved nearly one week's food for\r\nthree men and had not yet worked up our full sledging appetites. The\r\nbag was raised to the top of a six-foot snow mound, a thermograph being\r\nplaced alongside. As we now seemed to be on plateau snow, I thought it\r\nwise to leave behind my heavy boots and Swiss crampons.\r\n\r\nBy 4 P.M. the wind had decreased to a light breeze. Work was very slow\r\non a steeper up grade, and at six o'clock clouds came up quickly\r\nfrom the south-east and snow began to fall, so we camped at 7.30 P.M.\r\nthoroughly tired out. At twenty-four and a half miles the altitude was\r\nthree thousand two hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe snow was a false alarm. It ceased at 9 P.M. and the wind subsided to\r\na dead calm!!\r\n\r\nGood headway was being made against a strong breeze next day, when\r\nit was noticed that two gallons of kerosene were missing off the\r\nsupporters' sledge. While Murphy and Laseron went back two miles\r\nto recover them, Webb secured a magnetic declination and I took sun\r\nobservations for time and azimuth.\r\n\r\nWe were off early on the 18th and for the first time were able to\r\nappreciate the \"scenery.\" Glorious sunshine overhead and all around\r\nbrilliant snow, dappled by livid shadows; very different from the\r\nsmooth, soft, white mantle usually attributed to the surface of\r\nAntarctica by those in the homeland. Here and there, indeed, were\r\nsmooth patches which we called bowling-greens, but hard and slippery as\r\npolished marble, with much the same translucent appearance. Practically\r\nall the country, however, was a jumbled mass of small, hard sastrugi,\r\naveraging perhaps a foot in height, with an occasional gnarled old\r\nveteran twice as high. To either side the snow rolled away for miles.\r\nIn front, we made our first acquaintance with the accursed next ridge,\r\nwhich is always ahead of you on the plateau. Generally we passed from\r\none ridge to another so gradually that we could never say for certain\r\njust when we had topped one; still the next ridge was always there.\r\n\r\nThe weather had lately been colder with the increased altitude. The\r\ntemperature in daily range varied from -10 degrees F. to 9 degrees F.\r\nIt was so hot in the sun, on the 18th, that lunching inside the tent was\r\nunbearable. We preferred its shadow outside in the breeze.\r\n\r\nWearing a minimum of clothes, we marched along gaily during the\r\nafternoon. The country changed in a wonderful manner, the sastrugi\r\ngradually becoming smaller and finally disappearing. The surface was so\r\nsoft that a bamboo would easily penetrate it for a foot. Evidently it\r\nwas fairly old and laid down in calm weather, for excavations showed\r\nthat it became more compact without any hard wind-swept layers marking\r\nsuccessive snowfalls.\r\n\r\nIt was proved that we were commencing a descent of one thousand five\r\nhundred feet down the north side of a valley feeding the Mertz Glacier.\r\nIn order to explain the surface, smooth and unruffled by any wind, the\r\nquestion arose as to whether it is possible that there is a cushion\r\nof dead air more or less permanently over the north side of this\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\nOn the soft surface we were able to dispense with crampons. Hitherto, it\r\nhad been impossible to haul over a slippery surface in finnesko. Now we\r\nfelt as light as air and were vastly cheered when some one calculated\r\nthat the six of us were saving I don't know how many thousand\r\nfoot-pounds of work every mile. With a run of twelve miles we were\r\nforty-two miles from Winter Quarters.\r\n\r\nAnother splendid day on the 19th. We had lunch in a curious cup-shaped\r\nhollow, estimated to be two miles wide and one hundred and fifty feet\r\ndeep. Webb obtained here an approximate dip of 88 degrees 44',** a very\r\npromising increase from the Hut (87 degrees 27').\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** At the South Magnetic Pole the dip is 90 degrees.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nMap showing track of the southern sledging party from the Main Base\r\n\r\n\r\nSnow-blindness had now begun to make itself felt for the first time. I\r\nfor one had my first experience of it that afternoon. During the halt\r\nat lunch I put on yellow goggles in place of the smoked ones I had been\r\nwearing, and in a quarter of an hour the change of colour had 'settled'\r\nmy eyes for the time being.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was very hot. The thermometer stood at 10 degrees F. at\r\n4 P.M., but the still air made it almost insupportable. By the time\r\nthe load was hauled up out of the basin, we were streaming with\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\nBefore halting, we sighted a dark, distant ridge, thirty miles away,\r\nand the course was corrected by its bearing. Our extravagant hopes of\r\nfinding a permanently calm region had been dwindling for the last few\r\nmiles, as a hard bottom, a few inches under the surface, had become\r\nevident. They were finally dispelled by a south-west wind springing up\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nAs every one was beginning to feel the hard work after another\r\noppressive afternoon on the 20th, we decided to have an easy march next\r\nday and to build our first depot. Of course we had hoped to have been\r\nfarther out before sending back the supporting party, but the weather\r\nhad settled the question.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, taking things as easily as a thirty-five mile wind would\r\npermit, we pulled on, up and down small undulations till 4 P.M. when we\r\nencountered a small rise, with the next ridge a considerable distance\r\nahead. The depot was to be built here.\r\n\r\nWebb at once proceeded to take full magnetic declination, time and\r\nazimuth observations, Laseron recording for him. Murphy put in a\r\nmiserable hour over the primus melting snow. He was rather snow-blind\r\nand his eyes must have contributed a good deal of water to the pot. The\r\nwater was poured into food-bags filled with snow, which were buried,\r\nencircled by wire slings, in holes. Here they froze, making excellent\r\nholdfasts for the depot flag. Depot flags had been exercising our\r\ningenuity for months before the start, ordinary forms being destroyed by\r\nthe wind in a few hours. Webb had finally built the perfect flag of\r\nthe wind-vane type: a V of pieces of blackened Venesta board with light\r\nstruts at the back and a piece of aeroplane tubing at the apex which\r\nslipped over the bamboo pole. The pole, of two bamboos, stood sixteen\r\nfeet from the ground and was provided with two sets of flexible steel\r\nstays. Close by, Hurley and Hunter had built a snow mound ten feet in\r\ndiameter and ten feet in height, finished off with a capping of snow\r\nblocks wrapped in black bunting.\r\n\r\nNext day it was blowing a little harder and the sky was overcast, snow\r\nfalling all day. What bad light means can be gathered from the fact that\r\nLaseron on crawling out of the tent in the morning raised an alarm that\r\nour tent had been blown away in the night. It turned out that our tent\r\nwas hidden by a mound which he could not see, though only about ten\r\nyards from it.\r\n\r\nI had been given the option of relieving the supporting party of any of\r\ntheir gear I coveted and I used it freely. The sledgemeter was the first\r\nthing commandeered, ours, made by Correll, having developed some slight\r\ncomplaint in its interior. Their cooker, being in good condition, was\r\nalso taken. We all cast longing eyes at the roomy wind-proof tent but\r\nfinally decided that it was too heavy--forty pounds as against our own\r\nof twenty-six pounds, including tent and poles.\r\n\r\nAt 7 P.M. we said good-bye to our supporters, Hurley exposed the last\r\nplate of his big reflex camera, which they carried back to the Hut, and\r\na few minutes later Webb, Hurley, and I were standing alone watching\r\nthree black specks disappearing in the drift; a stiff wind helping them\r\nalong in great style. We were left to our own resources now, for better\r\nor for worse. \"Weird\" is how I described my feelings in the diary.\r\n\r\nThe same night it blew a hurricane and only dropped to sixty miles per\r\nhour during the 23rd, compelling us to remain in camp. Not an ideal\r\nbirthday for Webb, but we made the most of it. I quote from my diary:\r\n\"Turned out and rolled bags at 3 P.M. for lunch, for which we opened a\r\nwee tin of bacon ration brought for the occasion. Had some extra lumps\r\nof sugar (collared from the eleven-mile cave) in our tea. After the wine\r\nhad been round (i.e. after a special second cup of tea), I gave Eric\r\na pair of stockings from Murphy, and then 'Hoyle' and I smoked a cigar\r\neach which Webb produced. Dinner at 7 was also a special affair as we\r\nhad the remains of the bacon ration in the hoosh, with great effect.\r\nAlso an extra strong brew of cocoa boiled quite smooth. Burberrys on and\r\na stroll outside in the wind for a yard or two to get up a circulation;\r\nthen into bag where I am smoking a plebeian pipe which is very tame\r\nafter the glories of the day, especially as I suspect my tobacco of\r\nbeing a bit damp.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the first of the two \"auspicious occasions\" we had on the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAfter going carefully through the gear, we discarded a pickaxe, one\r\npair of big spiked boots and some odd clothing. We also decided, as\r\nthe probability of leisure was not great, to leave our reading matter\r\nbehind. It was with regret that I added my little 'Virginibus Puerisque'\r\nto the small pile of \"rejects.\" The load now amounted to seven hundred\r\nand forty-eight pounds in all. Not many days after, the floor-cloth\r\n(eight pounds) was left behind, as the japara sail afforded ample\r\nprotection from damp in the low temperatures of the plateau.\r\n\r\nThe dip-circle, which was to yield the most important result of our\r\njourney, was housed after much thought on a conveniently shaped kerosene\r\ntray between the tins of oil. Four light leather straps, buckled\r\ntightly, made a solid mass of tray, oil tins, and dip-circle; very safe,\r\nand easy to undo.\r\n\r\nMy orders were to proceed inland, due south, taking magnetic,\r\ngeographical, meteorological, and such other observations as were\r\npossible, returning to the Hut not later than January 15. Dr. Mawson had\r\nleft it to my discretion, in the event of any great change occurring in\r\nthe declination, to go either true or magnetic south.\r\n\r\nAt the Hut and up to about sixty miles south of it, the declination had\r\nproved fairly constant, but now at the Southern Cross Depot, as we\r\nhad christened the sixty-seven-mile camp, the compass, from pointing a\r\nlittle to the east of south, had travelled to 40 degrees east of\r\nsouth, so that it became obvious that there was considerable magnetic\r\ndisturbance in the country over which we were travelling. Whether\r\nwe went south or south-east seemed unlikely to affect the value of\r\ngeographical and other information we might gather, while Webb was of\r\nthe opinion that the best magnetic results would be obtained by\r\nmarching directly towards the Magnetic Pole, particularly if there were\r\ndisturbances over the intervening area. For these reasons the course was\r\nmaintained magnetic south.\r\n\r\nAt 11 A.M. on Sunday, November 24, we moved off to the south-east in a\r\nwind of fifty miles an hour. The light was bad, and steering had to be\r\ndone by sastrugi and wind. However, momentary glimpses of the sun served\r\nto check the course. The lunch camp was five miles from the depot, and\r\na good mound with a top of black bunting was left there. At almost every\r\nhalt, thus far on our journey, the snow cut for pitching the tent had\r\nbeen gathered up into a mound which, in addition to forming a landmark,\r\ncould often be used as a back-mark for checking the course. Our depot\r\nthus had a mound four miles on the southern and five miles on the\r\nnorthern side of it. It was not marked as well as I had hoped, but under\r\nthe circumstances we could not do better. Moreover, at intervals during\r\nthe day, some very distinctive snow ramps had appeared in the valley,\r\nsome five miles to the north-east, and their position was fixed relative\r\nto the course.\r\n\r\nOur hopes for a good afternoon were disappointed, as the wind and drift\r\ncame up again as strong as ever. The surface, too, grew worse; nothing\r\nbut sastrugi eighteen inches to thirty inches high and very close\r\ntogether. We were marching a little to the east of the wind, and the\r\nsledge was continually blown sideways, making considerable leeway. By\r\n8.30 P.M. it was blowing sixty miles per hour, so we halted, thoroughly\r\ntired out, having hauled our one-third of a ton eight and three-quarter\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nWhen it is blowing hard, the end of the day's march is not the end of\r\nthe day's work. As soon as a camping spot has been chosen, the sledge\r\nis pulled round head to wind. The straps round the load are loosened\r\ncarefully, the shovel and tent removed and the straps retightened. One\r\nman starts breaking out chunks of snow, experimenting until he finds a\r\nplace where large pieces come away readily. Lumps of forty pounds are\r\nthe handiest and quickest, but often only smaller ones can be obtained.\r\nThese are arranged in a circle round the tent-site, while the man with\r\nthe tent places it on the ground pointing upwind, the bottom of the\r\npoles being just where the middle windward leg will be, and makes a hole\r\nfor that leg.\r\n\r\nWhen everything is ready, all three catch hold of the tent, one man\r\ncrawling half into it, gripping hard the leather loop on the windward\r\nleg. The others sort out and grip their two side legs. \"All ready? Up!\"\r\nIt almost takes one's breath away, the roar and the flap! The side legs\r\nare quickly separated as the tent rises, and before it can blow over,\r\nthe leeward legs are more or less in position, taking the strain. The\r\ncentre man is throwing all his weight on to the leather loop, while the\r\nother two outside each holds down his windward pole with one hand and\r\nwith the other pulls blocks of snow on to the skirt to windward. Once\r\nthis is done, the rest is simple: cutting holes in just the right\r\npositions for the other legs, pulling out the skirt and making it snug\r\nall round. Then in goes the floor-cloth, and, by the time that is\r\nspread out properly, the primus and cooker are passed in. The cooker is\r\ndissected and the two water vessels passed out to be filled with snow.\r\nThe cook will have hard work to get the primus started if he does not\r\nshield the spirit flame from the wind, which blows through the tent, by\r\nputting the whole lamp inside the big cooker lid.\r\n\r\nIn come the pots filled with lumps of snow. The food tank is placed just\r\noutside the entrance, and the proper food-bags for the meal are passed\r\nin to the cook, the tank being retied to keep out drift. The cooker\r\nwill now be going at full pressure, and the cook is ready to receive\r\nthe gear. Sleeping-bags, \"computation bag,\" hypsometer, \"meat block\" (a\r\nthree-inch-square paper pad on which meteorological notes were taken);\r\nclothes-bag opened, three ditty-bags passed in and bag retied; a final\r\ntemperature taken and aneroid read; sledge anchored securely by tow-rope\r\nto the ice-axe, and a final look round to see all gear is safely\r\nstrapped down and snow-tight.\r\n\r\nIn calm weather, camping is a very different thing. On a fine day, half\r\nan hour after the halt would usually find us carefully scraping the last\r\nof the hoosh out of our pannikins, ready for the cocoa.\r\n\r\nAt the seventy-six-mile camp we tried the experiment of a break-wind.\r\nThe tent was so small and light that it was necessary to protect it in\r\nthe heavy winds. Hurley and I took about three-quarters of an hour to\r\nbuild the first one, but later we improved, getting into the knack of\r\nhewing snow with a sharp-pointed shovel.\r\n\r\nThat night in bag I wrote: \"The result of the breakwind is that for once\r\nwe have the wind bluffed. It is blowing seventy-five miles per hour--a\r\nfull hurricane--but all the viciousness is taken out of the flapping and\r\nthere will be no damage done to the tent by morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe wind was too strong for travelling early in the day (November 25).\r\nWhile outside we suddenly observed two snow petrels. It was hard to\r\nrealize that they had actually flown seventy-six miles inland to a\r\nheight of two thousand four hundred and fifty feet. I dashed inside for\r\nthe fishingline; Hurley got out the camera. They were a beautiful sight,\r\nhovering with outspread wings just above the snow, tipping it with their\r\nfeet now and then, to poise without a flutter in a sixty-five-mile gale.\r\nHurley secured a couple of \"snaps\" at the expense of badly frost-bitten\r\nhands. Just as I arrived with the line hooked and baited, the birds flew\r\naway to the north-east; our visions of fresh meat went with them. The\r\nline was always ready after this.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the wind dropped suddenly to twenty miles per hour.\r\nOur camp was stationed on the southern side of the large valley we had\r\nentered on the 18th, and we could identify the ridge crossed on that\r\ndate, blue and dim, forty miles away to the north. To the north-east\r\ncould be seen a distinct dip in the skyline, indicating the bed of the\r\nvalley, on whose northern side the dip met the higher skyline in a\r\nsteep bluff, twenty-five miles off. This bluff under the glasses was of\r\nheavily crevassed, blue ice.\r\n\r\nThe wind did not rise again much until 10 P.M., when we had moved on\r\nseven and a half miles, rising about three hundred feet over several\r\nridges and practically losing our view to the north.\r\n\r\nA steady breeze on the 26th, and, on the whole, good light, allowed us\r\nto make twelve miles.\r\n\r\nEach day, now, Webb took an approximate magnetic dip and declination in\r\nthe lee of the break-wind. This was necessary in order to get some\r\nidea of local disturbances. Also, it gave us some vague idea as to the\r\ndirection in which lay the South Magnetic Pole. For instance, at the\r\neighty-three-and-three-quarter-mile camp, the needle showed the Pole to\r\nbe 18 degrees east of true south, while at our lunch camp that day, six\r\nmiles farther on, it was given as 50 degrees east of south. The dip was\r\nso great that our prismatic compass would not set closer than about 15\r\ndegrees, but the long compass needle of the dip-circle, though of course\r\nsluggish, continued to give excellent results.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions it is obvious that the magnetic needle is quite\r\nuseless for steering purposes. The sun compass proved itself a more than\r\nefficient substitute. On a snowfield there is usually a total absence of\r\nlandmarks of any kind, so the direction of wind, sastrugi, or perhaps\r\na low cloud is found with the sun-compass, frequently checked, and the\r\ncourse kept accordingly. On camping we would generally carefully note\r\nthe direction in which the sledge was left, in case the next day proved\r\novercast. Thus we would march in the morning by the wind's direction\r\ntill the sun, gleaming through the clouds for a few moments, enabled us\r\nto use the compass again.\r\n\r\nSastrugi, only six inches high, seen on the 26th, showed the effects of\r\nwind-erosion exquisitely. In an individual case the windward end of a\r\nsastruga might be completely undercut for six or nine inches, leaving\r\na hard crust, sometimes only one-eighth of an inch in thickness and a\r\ncouple of inches wide. This would sag downwards under its own weight in\r\na fine curve till the tip rested on the snow beneath. It is marvellous\r\nhow such a delicate structure can withstand the heavy wind.\r\n\r\nNovember 27 proved a very hard day. The wind kept up sixty miles per\r\nhour all the time, so that, after taking four hours to do four and\r\nthree-quarter miles, we were all thoroughly exhausted. It was not a\r\ngreat run, but the century was hoisted--one hundred and three-quarter\r\nmiles by sledge-meter; altitude two thousand nine hundred feet. There\r\nwas a mild celebration that night over a square of butter-scotch and\r\nhalf an ounce of chocolate, besides the regular hoosh and cocoa.\r\n\r\nNext day the light was very bad and the wind fifty miles per hour.\r\nObservations were therefore made inside the tent. Webb, Hurley and\r\nthe instrument occupied all available space, while I spent three hours\r\ndigging a shaft eight feet deep in the snow, taking temperatures every\r\nfoot. It appeared that the mean annual temperature of the snow was\r\napproximately -16 degrees F.\r\n\r\nThe dip was 88 degrees 54'; certainly rather too large a rise from 88\r\ndegrees 20' of twenty miles back. The declination had actually changed\r\nabout 80 degrees in the last ten miles. This one-hundred-mile station\r\nwas badly disturbed. From the evidence, it is possible that a subsidiary\r\n\"pole\" or area of almost vertical dip may exist close by this spot to\r\nthe west or south-west.\r\n\r\nGoing straight up wind into a \"blow\" which varied from forty to fifty\r\nmiles per hour, we were able to make eight miles after the previous\r\nday's rest. At lunch a hole was dug five feet square and two feet deep.\r\nIt served three purposes. First, it gave a good shelter for a longitude\r\nobservation; secondly, with the mast, yard and floor-cloth we converted\r\nit into a shelter snug enough to house the primus and to lunch\r\ncomfortably; and thirdly, a mound was left as a back-mark which was\r\npicked up on the return journey.\r\n\r\nBy experience we found that a warm lunch and a rest enabled one to \"peg\"\r\nalong a good deal farther than would otherwise be possible.\r\n\r\nThe \"scenery\" in the afternoon became if possible more desolate--very\r\nfew new sastrugi, the surface appearing generally old and pitted. In\r\nsome places it was rotten and blown away, disclosing coarse granulated\r\nsubstrata. At the top of one ridge the snow merged into neve split into\r\nsmall crevasses, nine inches wide and four or five yards apart. The camp\r\nwas pitched, here, at 11 P.M. The latitude was 68 degrees 32' S., and we\r\nsaw the midnight sun for the first time that summer, about one-quarter\r\nof its rim remaining above the horizon.\r\n\r\nA full hurricane came up and kept between fifty and sixty miles per hour\r\nall day on the 30th. Before moving off, Webb found that the magnetic\r\nneedle had \"waltzed\" back 60 degrees since the one-hundred-mile camp,\r\nnow pointing 80 degrees east of south. Still, to allow the needle to\r\nmakeup its mind, we steered into the wind at 2 P.M., losing the neve and\r\nmeeting very rough country. By 6 P.M., with four miles to our credit, we\r\nwere nearly played out. It was being discussed whether we should go\r\non when the discovery was made that the theodolite legs were missing;\r\nprobably having slipped out in one of the numerous capsizes of the\r\nsledge.\r\n\r\nThe solemn rites of \"shut-eye\" determined that Webb was to stay and make\r\ncamp while Hurley and I retraced our steps. It was no easy matter to\r\nfollow the trail, for on hard snow the sledge runners leave no mark,\r\nand we had to watch for the holes of the crampon-spikes. About two and\r\na half miles back, the legs were found, and there only remained a hard\r\n\"plug\" against the wind to camp and hoosh.\r\n\r\nWhile we were lying half-toggled into the sleeping-bags, writing our\r\ndiaries, Hurley spent some time alternately imprecating the wind and\r\ninvoking it for a calm next day. As he said, once behind a break-wind\r\none could safely defy it, but on the march one is much more humble.\r\n\r\nWhether it was in honour of Queen Alexandra's birthday, or whether\r\nHurley's pious efforts of the evening before had taken effect, December\r\n1 turned out a good day. By noon, the wind had dropped sufficiently for\r\nus to hoist the Jack and Commonwealth Ensign for the occasion.\r\n\r\nAfter four miles of battling, there came into sight a distinct ridge,\r\nten miles to the west and south--quite the most definitely rising ground\r\nobserved since leaving the coast. In one place was a patch of immense\r\ncrevasses, easily visible to the naked eye; in another, due south, were\r\nblack shadows, and towards these the course was pointed.\r\n\r\nAt a point more than one hundred and twenty-five miles from the sea, a\r\nskua gull paid an afternoon call, alighting a few yards from the track.\r\nI immediately commenced to stalk it with a fishing-line, this time all\r\nready and baited with pemmican. However, it was quite contemptuous,\r\nflying off to the south-south-east as far as we could follow it. Was it\r\ntaking a short cut to the Ross Sea?\r\n\r\nDecember 2 saw us through \"Dead-Beat Gully\" to a rise, in sight of the\r\nshadows towards which we had been steering. Two miles away they appeared\r\nlike the edge of the moon seen through a large telescope. The\r\nshadows were due to large mounds of snow on the south side of a steep\r\nescarpment. Three main prominences were cross-connected with regular\r\nlines of hillocks, giving the impression of a subdivided town-site. The\r\nlow evening sun threw everything up in the most wonderful relief.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 3rd we were in a valley running west-north-west\r\nand east-south-east. The southern side rose steeply and from it\r\nprojected three large mounds, about two hundred feet from the bottom of\r\nthe valley, into which they fell just like tailings-heaps from a mine.\r\nThey were christened \"The Nodules.\"\r\n\r\nGoing due south uphill over neve we found ourselves in a regular network\r\nof crevasses. They were about ten feet wide and well bridged. Most\r\nnoticeable were \"hedges\" of ice up to six feet in height on either side\r\nof the crevasses which ran southward. It was now nearly calm and\r\nin every crack and chink in the snow-bridges beautiful fern-like\r\nice-crystals were seen. These must have been just forming, as a very\r\nlight puff of wind was seen to destroy many of them.\r\n\r\nWe spent three hours exploring the locality. On nearing the top of the\r\nridge, roped together, we found that the crevasses were becoming much\r\nwider, while the \"hedges\" were disappearing. The centre \"nodule\" was\r\nfound to be immediately north or to the leeward of the intersection of\r\ntwo crevasses, each about forty feet wide. The bridge of one crevasse\r\nhad dropped some thirty feet for a length of eighty yards. Doubtless, an\r\neddy from this hole accounts for the deposit of snow and, by accretions,\r\nfor the erection of the nodule. Webb went down at the end of the alpine\r\nrope and found the bridge below quite solid.\r\n\r\nFor about half a mile the summit of the slope was practically level,\r\nthree hundred feet above the bed of the valley. The surface was still of\r\nneve, intersected by canals forty, sixty and eighty feet wide, in which\r\nthe snow-bridge was generally four or five feet from the brink.\r\n\r\nOn the south-west horizon, perhaps twenty miles away, was a salient\r\ncrest streaked by three dark vertical bars; evidently another crevassed\r\narea.\r\n\r\nReturning to the sledge, we toggled-on and worked it up over the top of\r\nthe ridge, much regretting that time would not allow us to examine the\r\nother two large \"nodules.\" Hurley was in the lead, lengthening his line\r\nby thirty feet of alpine rope, but even then all three of us and the\r\nsledge were often on the lid of a crevasse. Luckily, the lids were\r\nfairly sound, and none of us went in beyond the waist. Finally, the\r\ntrail emerged on to ordinary sastrugi once more, where a halt was made\r\nfor lunch. We were all glad to have seen the place, but I think none of\r\nus has any wish to see another like it.\r\n\r\nThat night, after following the magnetic needle towards the south-east,\r\nwe were fairly on the plateau at one hundred and forty miles, with\r\nan altitude of four thousand four hundred feet. The dip, however, had\r\nsteadily decreased, standing now at 88 degrees 30'. There was some\r\nconsolation in the hope that a big, sudden rise was stored up for us\r\nsomewhere along the way ahead.\r\n\r\nDecember 4 and 5 were fine days, giving only twenty-two miles, as we\r\nmet with a rough surface; a large quantity of very hard, razor-backed\r\nsastrugi, generally about two feet high, like groined vaulting inverted,\r\non a small scale. Sledge and sledge-meter both had a very rough passage.\r\nThe sledge, for instance, balances itself on the top of a sastruga for a\r\nmoment, with an ominous bend in the runners, crashes down the slope and\r\njams its bow into the next one, from which it has to be lifted clear.\r\n\r\nDuring this run the needle again misbehaved itself, changing its\r\ndirection some 85 degrees in ten miles, but by the night of the 5th\r\nwe were getting past the disturbed locality and the dip had increased\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nFor the first time on the trip the wind veered round to the south-east.\r\nSnow had fallen overnight (December 5) and had drifted in long ramps\r\ndiagonally across the sastrugi. In two and a half hours we covered two\r\nand a quarter miles, blindly blundering in an uncertain light among\r\ncrests and troughs and through piles of soft, new snow. Then we stopped;\r\nWebb filling in the afternoon with a full set of dip observations.\r\n\r\nThat night the break-wind played its one possible trick. Waking on the\r\n8th, we found that the heavy snowfall, with only a moderate wind, had\r\ndrifted us up. Of course Hurley and I, who slept on the 'outsides,' had\r\nknown it most of the night. Before we could extricate ourselves from the\r\nbags Webb had to turn out from the middle to dig away the drift which\r\nwas weighing down the walls of the tent on top of us.\r\n\r\nIt was hopeless weather for travelling. In the afternoon a snow cave was\r\ndug, seven feet deep and enlarged to seven feet square at the bottom.\r\nThe whole was covered with mast, yard and sail. It was very snug from\r\nthe outward aspect, but we soon found that there were two objections to\r\nthe \"Sarcophagus,\" as it was named. There was very little light except a\r\nghastly blue half-tone filtering through the snow, and the place was not\r\nover warm, surrounded by walls at a much lower temperature than that of\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nWebb commenced a declination \"quick-run,\" consisting of half-hourly\r\nobservations of the direction in which the compass was pointing. In\r\nordinary latitudes, during the day, the compass needle moves over a\r\nfew minutes of arc, but here, being so close to the Magnetic Pole, its\r\nmovement is greatly magnified, the range being about 5 degrees on\r\nthis occasion. Webb carried on readings till midnight, and at 4 A.M.,\r\nDecember 9, I turned out, being relieved at 8 A.M. by Hurley, who\r\ncarried on until the twenty-four hours were completed. This observation\r\nshould be especially valuable when it is compared with continuous\r\nmagnetic records obtained at the same time at Winter Quarters and by the\r\nScott expedition at McMurdo Sound.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1.30 P.M. on December 10 that the sixty-mile wind had\r\nsubsided sufficiently for us to get away. Every yard of our quota of\r\nseven miles was hard going. A fine example of a typical old sastruga was\r\npassed on the way. In order to secure a photograph of it, Hurley had\r\nto waste eighteen films before he could persuade one to pull into place\r\ncorrectly. The film-packs had been carefully kept in an airtight tin,\r\nbut the cold was too much for them. The tags which should pull each film\r\nround from the back to the front of the pack usually tore away with a\r\nsmall piece of film. In fact, out of one hundred and twenty films only\r\nforty-five exposures were made.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th a good deal of \"piecrust\" cut down the day's march to eight\r\nand a half miles. Sledge runners are usually supported by this surface,\r\nbut one's feet break through in a most annoying and tiring manner. The\r\ndrift eased off for a few hours and we managed to dry some of our gear.\r\nAt the Sarcophagus, things which had all been wet enough before became\r\nsaturated with drift which turned to ice. Felt mitts are perhaps the\r\nworst in this respect, and it is no exaggeration to say that you could\r\neasily brain a man with one after it had been worn in drift for a couple\r\nof days.\r\n\r\nThat night I decided that one more day must see us at our depot.\r\nAllowing three days' grace for contingencies, there were thirty-one days\r\nfor us to attain our farthest southerly point and back to the Hut.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th we planned to reach a spot for the depot, two hundred\r\nmiles out, and by 11.30 P.M. came on a fine site at one hundred and\r\nninety-nine and three-quarter miles; altitude four thousand eight\r\nhundred and fifty feet, latitude 69 degrees 83.1' south; longitude\r\n140 degrees 20' east. Everything possible was left behind, the\r\nsledge-decking being even cut away, until only three light bamboo slats\r\nremained. A pile, including ten days' food and one gallon of kerosene,\r\nwas placed on a small mound to prevent it being drifted over. A few\r\nyards distant rose a solid nine-foot cairn surmounted by a black\r\ncanvas-and-wire flag, six feet higher, well stayed with steel wire.\r\n\r\nI took on food for seventeen days, three days more than I intended to\r\nbe out, partly so that we could keep on longer if we found we could\r\nmake very fast time, and also as a safeguard against thick weather when\r\nreturning to the depot.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening we set off against a stiff breeze. The sledge ran\r\nlightly for three and a half miles, and we camped. The depot showed up\r\nwell in the north-west as a bright golden spot in the low midnight sun.\r\n\r\nNext day the piecrust was so bad that, despite the lessened load, we\r\nonly covered twelve miles. The surface was smoothly polished, and we\r\neither crashed through it from four inches to a foot or else slipped and\r\ncame down heavily on knees, elbow, or head. New finnesko were largely\r\nresponsible for such an accident.\r\n\r\nAt 11 P.M. a remarkable ramp, five chains long, was passed. On its\r\nwindward side was a tangled cluster of large sastrugi. They made one\r\nimagine that the wind, infuriated at finding a block of snow impeding\r\nits progress, had run amok with a giant gouge, endeavouring to pare it\r\ndown. Every now and then, the gouge, missing its aim, had taken great\r\nlateral scoops from the surface, leaving trenches two and three feet\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nIn bags that night we had a talk (not the first by any means) over\r\nour prospects. Up to the one hundred-and-seventy-four-mile camp, four\r\nhundred miles seemed dimly possible, but now we saw we would be lucky to\r\nreach three hundred miles. Moreover, the dip at this spot was 89 degrees\r\n11', practically what it had been ever since one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles. Sixty-five miles for nothing! How far for the other forty-nine\r\nminutes which were needed for a vertical dip and the South Magnetic\r\nPole? This problem was insoluble, so each toggled himself into his bag\r\nin a rather depressed state of mind.\r\n\r\nDecember 16 was a glorious day; only a fifteen-mile wind, and for ten\r\nmiles an improved surface. There was no drift, consequently opportunity\r\nwas taken to turn the sleeping bags inside out. They needed it, too. The\r\nupper parts were not so bad as they had been propped open occasionally,\r\nbut the lower halves were coated with solid ice. For the first time for\r\nweeks we did not wear burberrys, as the weather was so warm. Fourteen\r\nmiles was the total work, the previous day's being twelve.\r\n\r\nAll three of us were having trouble with snow-blindness; the \"zinc and\r\ncocaine\" tabloids being in great demand.\r\n\r\nLatitude 70 degrees south was passed on the 17th and we were another\r\nfourteen miles to the good. The dip was on the increase 89 degrees 25'\r\nand the declination swung to 40 degrees east of the magnetic meridian.\r\nAt two hundred and fifty-six miles the altitude was five thousand five\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe temperature was getting lower; the minimum being -21 degrees F.\r\non the night of the 17th, rising to a maximum of 3 degrees F. on the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nThere was dead calm and a regular heat wave on December 19. As the sun\r\nrose higher and higher, the tent became absolutely oppressive. The rime\r\ncoating the walls inside thawed and water actually trickled into our\r\nfinnesko. Usually we awoke to find them frozen hard, just as we had\r\nshaped them on the previous night, but on this particular morning they\r\nwere pathetically limp and wet. The temperature inside the tent was 66\r\ndegrees F., heated, of course, by the sun's rays which raised our black\r\nbulb thermometer to 105 degrees F. We were not used to this sort of\r\nthing and struggled out hurriedly for a breath of fresh air.\r\n\r\nOnce into harness, we began to feel the effects of exertion. By degrees\r\nwe got rid of our clothing, but unfortunately soon came to bedrock in\r\nthat respect, as the underclothing was sewn on and immovable. At lunch\r\ntime, with the thermometer at -2 degrees F. in the shade, we reluctantly\r\ndressed knowing how soon we would cool off. About 9 P.M. clouds moved\r\nover rapidly from the south-east and the landscape faded into the blank,\r\nshadowless nothing of an overcast day. The camp was pitched at two\r\nhundred and eighty-three miles amidst a jumble of ramps and sastrugi.\r\nThe dip had seen fit to rise to 89 degrees 35'.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the wind was doing thirty miles per hour, which certainly\r\nseemed to be the normal thing. It fell to a nice sailing breeze, but,\r\nat the time, we were not very appreciative of anything as the course\r\nwas uphill. Again, it was to be the last day's run, so we were \"all out\"\r\nwhen the halt came after a good fifteen miles--the longest day's march\r\non the outward journey. Nevertheless, Webb unpacked the theodolite after\r\nhoosh and took an altitude of the sun at midnight.\r\n\r\nOn December 21 the load on the sledge was stripped down to tent,\r\ndip-circle, theodolite, cooker and a little food. For two and a half\r\nmiles we went south-east over rising ground until the sledge-meter\r\nshowed three hundred and one miles.\r\n\r\nWhile Hurley and I pitched the tent, Webb built a breakwind for his\r\ninstrument fifty yards away. Then followed a long set of magnetic\r\nobservations. About 5 P.M. the magnetic work was interrupted; the\r\ntheodolite replacing the dip-circle on the legs, while I took a\r\nlongitude shot. I was seeing double, being slightly snow-blind, and had\r\nsome difficulty in choosing the correct combination from the assortment\r\nof suns and cross-wires visible in the telescope. Setting the vertical\r\nand horizontal wires simultaneously on the sun was beyond me; Webb\r\ntaking the observations for the true meridian, which also checked my\r\nlongitude shot.\r\n\r\nMagnetic work under these conditions is an extremely uncomfortable\r\noperation. Even a light wind will eddy round the break-wind, and it is\r\nwind which makes low temperatures formidable. Nearly all the work has to\r\nbe done with bare fingers or thin instrument-gloves, and the time\r\ntaken is far greater than in temperate climates, owing to the fingers\r\nconstantly \"going\" and because of the necessity of continually freeing\r\nthe instrument from the condensed moisture of the breath. Considering\r\nthat the temperature was -12 degrees F. when he had finished his four\r\nhours' work, it may be imagined that Webb was ready for his hot tea. The\r\ndip proved to be 89 degrees 43.5', that is, sixteen and a half minutes\r\nfrom the vertical. The altitude was just over five thousand nine hundred\r\nfeet, in latitude 70 degrees 36.5' south and longitude 148 degrees 10'\r\neast.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch the Union Jack and the Commonwealth Ensign were hoisted and\r\nthree cheers given for the King--willing but rather lonesome away out\r\nthere! We searched the horizon with glasses but could see nothing save\r\nsnow, undulating in endless sastrugi. To the south-east the horizon\r\nwas limited by our old enemy, \"the next ridge,\" some two miles away.\r\nWe wondered what could be beyond, although we knew it was only the same\r\nfeatureless repetition, since one hundred and seventy-five miles on the\r\nsame course would bring us to the spot where David, Mawson and Mackay\r\nhad stood in 1909.\r\n\r\nAfter Hurley had taken a photograph of the camp, the tent was struck and\r\nthe sledge repacked. At last the sail was rigged, we gave a final glance\r\nback and turned on the homeward trail.\r\n\r\nMy diary of that night sums up: \"We have now been exactly six weeks on\r\nthe tramp and somehow feel rather sad at turning back, even though\r\nit has not been quite a Sunday school picnic all along. It is a great\r\ndisappointment not to see a dip of 90 deg., but the time is too short\r\nwith this 'climate.' It was higher than we expected to get, after the\r\nunsatisfactory dips obtained near the two-hundred-mile depot. The rate\r\nof increase since that spot has been fairly uniform and indicates that\r\n90 degrees might be reached in another fifty to sixty miles, if the same\r\nrate held, and that means at least another week. It's no good thinking\r\nabout it for 'orders are orders.' We'll have our work cut out to get\r\nback as it is. Twenty-five days till we are overdue. Certainly we have\r\ntwenty-three days' food, eight days' with us, ten days' at two hundred\r\nmiles, and five days' at sixty-seven miles, so with luck we should not\r\ngo hungry, but Webb wants to get five more full sets of dips if possible\r\non the way back, and this means two and a half days.\"\r\n\r\nThat night the minimum thermometer registered its lowest at -25 degrees\r\nF. It was December 21 and Midsummer Day, so we concluded that the spot\r\nwould be a very chilly one in the winter.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture we were very short of finnesko. The new ones we had\r\nworn since the two-hundred-mile camp had moulted badly and were now\r\nalmost \"bald.\" The stitching wears through as soon as the hair comes off\r\nand frequent mending is necessary.\r\n\r\nWe rose earlier than usual on the 22nd, so as to get more advantage from\r\nthe wind, which each evening had always tended to die down somewhat.\r\nWith forty-two square feet of sail, the twenty-mile wind was too much\r\nfor us, the sledge capsizing on the smallest pretext. Instead of\r\nhanging the yard from the top of the mast, we placed it across the load,\r\nreversing the sail and hooking the clews over the top of the mast. Three\r\nor four pieces of lampwick at intervals served as reefing-points by\r\nwhich the area of the sail could be quickly cut down by bunching the\r\nupper part as much as was necessary.\r\n\r\nDuring the day we frequently saw our tracks in patches of snow left\r\nduring a previous snowfall, but they were much eroded, although only\r\nthree days old. After sledging in Adelie Land it is hard to realize\r\nthat on certain parts of the Ross Barrier tracks a year old may remain\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the two-hundred-and-eighty-three-mile mound, the\r\nsledge-meter became very sickly. Spoke after spoke had parted and we\r\nsaw that nothing we could do would make it last very much longer. As we\r\nintended in one place to make a cross-country run of seventy miles, so\r\nas to cut off the detour to the \"Nodules,\" the meter was carried on the\r\nsledge. We had now the mounds to check distances.\r\n\r\nOn December 23 we were lucky enough to catch sight of the\r\ntwo-hundred-and-sixty-nine-mile mound and later the one at two hundred\r\nand sixty-one miles, though there was a good deal of drift. The day's\r\nrun was twenty and a half miles.\r\n\r\nA thing which helped us unexpectedly was that, now with the wind behind,\r\nwe found it unnecessary to wear the stiff, heavy, frozen, burberry\r\ntrousers. Thick pyjama trousers took their place in all except the worst\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nAt our old two-hundred-and-forty-nine-mile camp, Webb took a complete\r\nset of magnetic observations and another time-shot for watch-rate. It\r\nwas late when these were over, so we did only two and a half miles more,\r\nhalting for Christmas Eve, well content with a run of fourteen miles in\r\naddition to a set of observations.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day the country was very rough, making sailing difficult.\r\nStill, eighteen and a half miles were left behind. The wind was\r\npractically along the sastrugi and the course was diagonal to both. As\r\nthe sledge strikes each sastruga, it skids northwards along it to the\r\ndiscomfort of the wheelers and the disgust of the leader.\r\n\r\nFor Christmas dinner that night we had to content ourselves\r\nwith revising the menu for the meal which was to celebrate the\r\ntwo-hundred-mile depot. But now it was all pretty well mapped out,\r\nhaving been matured in its finer details for several days on the march.\r\nHors d'oeuvre, soup, meat, pudding, sweets and wine were all designed,\r\nand estimates were out. Would we pick up the depot soon enough to\r\njustify an \"auspicious occasion\"?\r\n\r\nNext day the wind was due south at thirty miles per hour. Dodging big\r\nramps and overturning on sastrugi, at the same time dragging well\r\nupwind of the course to save leeway, twelve miles went by without the\r\ntwo-hundred-and-fifteen-mile mound coming into sight. Finally, a search\r\nwith the glasses through falling snow revealed it a good two miles back.\r\nAs we particularly wanted some photos of the ramps at this camp, we made\r\nacross to it and had lunch there, Hurley exposing the last of the films.\r\n\r\nAt two hundred and nine miles \"Lot's Wife\" appeared--a tall, thin mound\r\nwhich Hurley had erected during a lunch-camp on the way out.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, with a thirty-five-mile wind and a good deal of drift, we\r\ndid not see the two-hundred-and-three-mile mound until we almost ran\r\ninto it. By three o'clock the great event occurred--the depot was found!\r\nWe determined to hold the Christmas feast. After a cup of tea and a bit\r\nof biscuit, the rest of the lunch ration was put aside.\r\n\r\nWebb set up his instrument in the lee of the big mound and commenced a\r\nset of observations; I sorted out gear from the depot and rearranged the\r\nsledge load; Hurley was busy in the tent concocting all kinds of dishes.\r\nAs the tableware was limited to three mugs and the Nansen cooker, we had\r\nto come in to deal with each course the moment it was ready. Aiming at a\r\nreally high-class meal, Hurley had started by actually cleaning out the\r\ncooker.\r\n\r\nThe absence of reindeer-hair and other oddments made everything taste\r\nquite strange, though the basis was still the same old ration with a\r\nfew remaining \"perks.\" After the \"raisin gliders,\" soup and a good stiff\r\nhoosh, Webb finished his observations while I recorded for him. It is\r\nwonderful what sledging does for the appetite. For the first week of\r\nthe journey, the unaccustomed ration was too much for us; but now when\r\nHurley announced \"Pudding!\" we were all still ravenous. It was a fine\r\nexample of ye goode olde English plum-pudding, made from biscuit\r\ngrated with the Bonsa-saw, fat picked out of the pemmican, raisins and\r\nglaxo-and-sugar, all boiled in an old food-bag.\r\n\r\nThis pudding was so filling that we could hardly struggle through a\r\nsavoury, \"Angels on runners,\" and cocoa. There was a general recovery\r\nwhen the \"wine\" was produced, made from stewed raisins and primus\r\nalcohol; and \"The King\" was toasted with much gusto. At the first sip,\r\nto say the least, we were disappointed. The rule of \"no heel taps\"\r\nnearly settled us, and quite a long interval and cigars, saved up for\r\nthe occasion by Webb, were necessary before we could get courage enough\r\nto drink to the Other Sledging Parties and Our Supporting Party.\r\n\r\nThe sun was low in the south when, cigars out and conversation lagging,\r\nwe finally toggled in for the finest sleep of the whole journey.\r\n\r\nThe cook, under a doubtful inspiration, broke forth, later on, into a\r\nChristmas Carol:\r\n\r\n    I've dined in many places but never such as these-\r\n    It's like the Gates of Heaven when you find you've lost the keys.\r\n    I've dined with kings and emperors, perhaps you scarce believe;\r\n    And even they do funny things when round comes Christmas Eve.\r\n    I've feasted with iguanas on a lonely desert isle;\r\n    Once in the shade of a wattle by a maiden's winsome smile.\r\n    I've \"grubbed\" at a threepenny hash-house, I've been at a\r\n      counter-lunch,\r\n    Reclined at a clap-up cafe where only the \"swankers\" munch.\r\n    In short, I've dined from Horn to Cape and up Alaska-way\r\n    But the finest, funniest dinner of all was on that Xmas Day.\r\n\r\nFor the first ten miles on the afternoon of the 28th, the sail was\r\nreefed down to prevent the sledge overrunning us on smooth patches. Not\r\nfar past the one-hundred-and-ninety-mile mound, which was missed in the\r\ndrift, we picked up some of the outward tracks--a bas-relief of three\r\nfootsteps and a yard of sledge-meter track, raised half an inch and\r\nundercut by the wind. It was not very much, but quite a comfort when one\r\nis navigating in blinding weather.\r\n\r\nAt 11.30 P.M. we had marched twenty-one miles, and both light and\r\nsurface were improving, so I proposed making a long run of it. Hurley\r\nand Webb eagerly agreed, and we had a preparatory hoosh. Ten miles\r\nscudded by monotonously without a sign of the mounds around the\r\none-hundred-and-seventy-mile camp. As we were in the vicinity of a point\r\nwhere we had determined to diverge from our outward track, a course\r\nwas laid direct for the one-hundred-and-thirteen-mile mark. The\r\nsledge-meter, which had been affixed, made its presence evident from\r\ntime to time by ringing like a cash register, as still another broken\r\nspoke struck the forks. We would halt for a moment and extract the\r\nremains. Out of the original thirty-six wire spokes, only twelve wire\r\nand one wooden one remained. At 11.30 A.M. on December 29, a halt was\r\ncalled and the sledge-meter was then lying over on its side with a\r\nhelpless expression. It indicated twenty-two miles, making, so we\r\nthought, a total of forty-three miles in the twenty-two and a quarter\r\nhours since leaving the depot. Observations for position next day proved\r\nthat in its dying effort it exaggerated the truth; the total run being\r\n41.6 miles.\r\n\r\nWe were now well ahead of schedule time, there being four and a half\r\ndays' surplus food; above what was probably required to reach the\r\nsixty-seven-and-a-half-mile depot. It was decided to hold three days of\r\nthis and to use one and a half days food as a bonus during the coming\r\nweek, as long as we were ahead of our necessary distance. The sledging\r\nration is quite enough to live on, but for the whole of the journey\r\nwe had felt that we could have done more distance on a slightly larger\r\nration. This may be partly explained by our comparatively high altitude.\r\n\r\nNext morning the sledge-meter was cut away and stuck in the snow. It\r\nlooked very forlorn sitting askew in its forks, with a pair of worn-out\r\nfinnesko hanging over it.\r\n\r\nAfter twelve miles with a favourable wind, Webb took more observations;\r\nHurley and I recording by turns. There were several small holes in the\r\ntent which needed mending, and I experimented with adhesive plaster from\r\nthe medical kit with great success. Heated over a fusee and pressed hard\r\ndown between the bottoms of mugs, held outside and inside, the patches\r\nadhered well and made a permanent job.\r\n\r\nEarly on December 31, 1912, snow was falling. The light gave Hurley an\r\nattack of snow-blindness and a miserable day. Crampons were worn to give\r\nsome security to the foothold on the uneven track. The position, after\r\na trudge of fifteen miles, was estimated at five miles east of the\r\none-hundred-and-twenty-three-mile mound.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day, 1913, the wind was fresher and the surface improved.\r\nEstimation placed us to the north of one hundred and thirteen miles, but\r\nwe were not hopeful in the light falling snow of seeing a mound. Soon,\r\nhowever, the snow ceased, and Webb made out a hillock two miles ahead.\r\nIt was identified as the one at one hundred and nine miles.\r\n\r\nIt had been my turn to be snowblind. I was so bad that the only thing to\r\ndo was to camp or ride on the sledge. The trail changed here to straight\r\ndownwind, so Webb and Hurley undertook the job, hauling the sledge\r\nwith me as a passenger for three and a half miles to the\r\none-hundred-and-five-mile mound. It must have been a trying finish to a\r\nrun of twenty miles.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the spell, which was a sleepless one, I was no better in\r\nthe morning and again had to ride. The others pulled away for five miles\r\nwith a good helping wind, but in a provoking light. The camp was made\r\nwhere the one-hundred-mile mound was judged to be. We spent longer\r\nover lunch, hoping that the clouds would clear. At last we moved on, or\r\nrather _I_ was moved on. After two miles the surface became heavier. My\r\neyes were better now on account of the rest and a snow \"poultice\" Webb\r\nhad invented. I harnessed-in for five miles over light, unpacked snow,\r\nwith piecrust underneath. The day's work was twelve miles.\r\n\r\nThe snow-clouds broke at noon on January 3, and a reliable latitude was\r\nobtained. It agreed with our reckoning. Persevering over the same trying\r\nsurface as on the previous day, we sighted the ninety-mile-mound in the\r\nrear as a rift broke in the sky. We must have passed a few hundred yards\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nWe were still eleven miles from the depot, so at breakfast on the 4th\r\nthe rations were reduced by one-half to give plenty of time to locate\r\nour goal. On the 4th the sky was clear, but surface drift prevented\r\nus from seeing any mounds till, in the afternoon, the ramps near the\r\nsixty-seven-mile depot were discovered in fitful glimpses. They bore\r\ntoo much to the north, so we altered course correspondingly to the west,\r\ncamping in rising wind and drift, with great hopes for the morrow.\r\n\r\nA densely overcast sky on the 5th; light snow falling! We moved on two\r\nmiles, but not being able to see one hundred yards, camped again;\r\nthen walking as far as seemed safe in various directions. One could do\r\nnothing but wait for clear weather. The clouds lightened at 6 P.M. and\r\nagain at 9 P.M., when altitudes of the sun were secured, putting us four\r\nmiles south of the depot.\r\n\r\nWith only one chronometer watch, one has to rely entirely on dead\r\nreckoning for longitude, the rate of a single watch being very variable.\r\nThe longitude obtained on this occasion from our latest known rate\r\nmoved us several miles to the east of the depot, so I concluded that\r\nour distances since the camp at ninety miles had been overestimated, and\r\nthat we were probably to the south-east of it. Accordingly, we shifted\r\nfour miles to the north-west, but by this time it had again clouded over\r\nand nothing could be seen.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th the sky was still overcast, but a lucky peep at noon aligned\r\nus on the exact latitude of the depot. We walked east and west, but it\r\nsnowed persistently and everything was invisible.\r\n\r\nIt is weary work waiting in the tent for weather to improve. During this\r\ntime Hurley amused himself and us by composing a Christmas carol on the\r\nChristmas dinner; a fragment from which has already appeared. I whiled\r\naway a whole afternoon, cutting up the remains of two cigars which had\r\nrefused to draw. Sliced up with a pair of scissors and mixed with a few\r\nof Hurley's cigarettes, they made very good smoking tobacco.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th the sky was immovable, and we trekked four miles due east,\r\ncamped once more and walked about without finding our goal.\r\n\r\nI now decided that if the weather did not improve by the morning, we\r\nshould have to dash for the north. It was a risk, but matters were\r\ncoming to a serious pass. On broaching the subject to Webb and Hurley,\r\nthey unconditionally agreed with me.\r\n\r\nAt 3 A.M. the sky cleared rapidly and we turned out and saw the ramps\r\nplainly to the east. Webb set up the theodolite while Hurley and I paced\r\nout a half-mile base-line to find out the intervening distance. Just\r\nas we got to the end of it, however, the clouds came over again and the\r\nramps faded.\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing for it now, and that was to make a break for\r\nthe coast. Of food, there was one full day's ration with enough pemmican\r\nfor half a hoosh, six lumps of sugar and nine raisins, rather the worse\r\nfor wear, oil for two days, and, last but not least, a pint of alcohol.\r\nAfter four days on half-rations we felt fairly fit, thanks no doubt to\r\nthe good meals of the previous week.\r\n\r\nThere were sixty-seven miles to go, and in case we did not happen on\r\nthe narrow descent to the Hut, the food was apportioned to last for\r\nfive days. Everything unessential was stripped off the sledge, including\r\ndip-circle, thermometers, hypsometer, camera, spare clothing and most of\r\nthe medical and repair kits.\r\n\r\nAt 7 A.M. we set off on the final stage of the journey. The sky was\r\ndensely overcast and snow was falling, but there was a strong wind\r\nalmost behind. We would march for an hour by my wrist-watch, halt for\r\nfive minutes and on again till all agreed that we had covered ten miles;\r\nwhen it was lunch time. Each man's share of this consisted of one-third\r\nof a biscuit, one-third of an ounce of butter and a drink made of a\r\nspoonful of glaxo-and-sugar and one of absolute alcohol, mixed in a mug\r\nof lukewarm water. We could not afford oil enough to do much more than\r\nthaw the water, but the alcohol warmed us splendidly, enabling us to get\r\na good rest.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour's spell we started again, luckily seeing just enough of\r\nthe sun to check the course. The wind grew stronger in the afternoon and\r\nseveral times dense fog-banks drove down on us. Meeting one steep rise,\r\nwe sidled round it for what seemed hours, but my chief memory of that\r\nafternoon was of the clouds of the northern horizon. They were a deep\r\nbluish-grey colour--a typical \"water-sky\"--but I have never seen clouds\r\nmoving so fast. It was like trying to steer by one particular phase in a\r\nkaleidoscope. When all were satisfied that twenty miles had been covered\r\nwe camped.\r\n\r\nDinner consisted of a very watery hoosh, followed up by a mug of alcohol\r\nand water. We were all very thankful for the forethought of Dr. Mawson\r\nin providing absolute alcohol for lighting the primus, instead of\r\nmethylated spirit.\r\n\r\nBreakfast on the 9th was of about the same consistency as dinner on the\r\nnight before, except that cocoa replaced the alcohol. In fact, breakfast\r\nwas possibly even more watery, as I was in charge of the food-bag and\r\nsurreptitiously decided to make the rations last six days instead of\r\nfive.\r\n\r\nThis was the worst day's march of the journey. The wind was booming\r\nalong at sixty miles per hour with dense drift and falling snow. What\r\nmade it worse was that it came from the south-east, forcing us to pull\r\npartly across it. I was the upwind wheeler and had to hitch on to the\r\nside of the sledge to reduce the leeway as much as possible. The sledge\r\nwas being continually jammed into big, old, invisible sastrugi and we\r\nfell about in the wind until crampons became absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAt 4 P.M. we were disgusted to find that the wind had veered to\r\nsouth-by-east. So for possibly several hours we had been doing Heaven\r\nonly knows how many times the amount of work necessary, and for any time\r\nup to four hours might have been marching three points off our course.\r\nBeing blown straight downwind, the sledge made rapid progress, and about\r\n6 P.M. a halt was called for lunch. This was over almost as soon as\r\nit was begun, but we had a good rest, sheltering ourselves with the\r\nfloor-cloth from the wind which blew through the tent.\r\n\r\nOff again, we \"plugged\" away until midnight when we were much surprised\r\nto find the usual snow surface merging into blue ice. The tent was\r\npitched on the latter, snow being procured from the bridge of a crevasse\r\nas we had no pick: even the ice-axe having been left behind.\r\n\r\nTurning out on the morning of the 10th, we were delighted to find the\r\nsky clearing and the wind moderating. And then, far away on the northern\r\nhorizon a beautiful line of blue sea dotted with bergs!\r\n\r\nWe now officially considered ourselves to be twenty-seven miles from\r\nthe Hut. As we should not have met blue ice on the proper course till\r\nwe were only thirteen miles out, it was thought that we had edged a long\r\nway to the east the day before. When a start was made, we manoeuvred to\r\nthe west in looking for a crossing-place at each crevasse.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the bergs on the horizon were noticeably\r\nenlarging, and at last we realized that in reality it was only a few\r\nmiles to them. Suddenly the grade increased, the ice becoming much\r\nlacerated; and we had some trouble getting the sledge along. Hurley was\r\nsnow-blind and had one eye covered. He looked very comical feeling his\r\nway over the crevasses, but he probably did not feel over-humorous.\r\n\r\nI was in the lead, and suddenly coming over a ridge above a steep\r\nice-fall, I caught sight of the Mackellar Islets and the old \"Piano\"\r\nberg. Just at the same instant the spur of ice on which I was standing\r\ncollapsed, and down I went into a crevasse. The others quickly had me\r\nout, and, as soon as I was in the upper air, I gave them the news:\r\n\"There are the Islands!\" Being twenty feet farther back on the rope they\r\nhad not yet seen them.\r\n\r\nWe were now able to place ourselves about three miles west of Aladdin's\r\nCave. The last camp must have been thirteen miles from the Hut, and we\r\nhad really done twenty-seven miles each day instead of our conservative\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nWe tried to work along to the east, but the ice was too much broken,\r\nso the camp was made on a patch of snow. In view of our good fortune, I\r\nproduced that evening's ration of hoosh in addition to our usual lunch.\r\nEven this meagre spree went against Hurley's feelings, for, being\r\nsnow-blind, he had not been able to see the islands and positively would\r\nnot believe that we were nearly home.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch it was necessary to retrace our way upwind to get out of the\r\nrough country. About midnight, Webb recognized Aladdin's Cave. Hurley\r\nand I had a competition as to who should see it first, for I was also\r\ngetting a little blind again. We had a dead-heat at one hundred and\r\nfifty yards.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to arrest our attention was a tin of dog biscuits. These\r\nkept things going till we dug out a food tank from which was rapidly\r\nextracted a week's supply of chocolate. After that we proceeded in a\r\nhappier frame of mind to open up the cave and have a meal.\r\n\r\nThe journey of more than six hundred miles was now practically over.\r\nAfter a carousal lasting till 5 P.M. on the 11th, we went down hill,\r\narriving just after dinner and finding all well.\r\n\r\nWe three had never thought the Hut quite such a fine place, nor have we\r\never since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV EASTWARD OVER THE SEA-ICE\r\n\r\nby C. T. MADIGAN\r\n\r\n    Harnessed and girt in his canvas bands,\r\n    Toggled and roped to his load;\r\n    With helmeted head and bemittened hands,\r\n    This for his spur and his goad:\r\n\r\n  \"Out in the derelict fastnesses bare\r\n    Some whit of truth may be won.\"\r\n    Be it a will o' the wisp, he will fare\r\n    Forth to the rising sun.\r\n\r\n                             The Sledge Horse\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Coastal party consisted of Dr. A. L. McLean, P. E. Correll\r\nand myself. For weeks all preparations had been made; the decking put\r\non the sledge, runners polished, cooker- and instrument-boxes attached,\r\nmast erected, spar and sail rigged, instruments and clothing collected,\r\ntent strengthened--all the impedimenta of a sledge journey arranged and\r\nrearranged, and still the blizzard raged on. Would we never get away?\r\nNovember arrived, and still the wind kept up daily averages of over\r\nfifty miles per hour, with scarce a day without drifting snow.\r\n\r\nAt last it was decided that a start must soon be made even though it\r\nended in failure, so that we received orders to set out on November 6,\r\nor the first possible day after it.\r\n\r\nFriday November 8 broke, a clear driftless day, and Murphy's party left\r\nearly in the morning. By noon, Stillwell's party (Stillwell, Hodgeman\r\nand Close), and we, were ready to start. The former were bound on a\r\nshort journey to the near east and were to support us until we parted\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nAll was bustle and excitement. Every one turned out to see us off.\r\nBreaking an empty sauce-bottle over the bow of our sledge, we christened\r\nit the M.H.S. Championship (Man-Hauled Sledge). The name was no\r\nboastful prevision of mighty deeds, as, at the Hut, a \"Championship\" was\r\nunderstood to mean some careless action usually occasioning damage to\r\nproperty, while our party included several noted \"champions.\"\r\n\r\nMertz harnessed a dog-team to the sledge and helped us up the first\r\nsteep slope. With hearty handshakes and a generous cheer from the other\r\nfellows, we started off and were at last away, after many months of\r\nhibernation in the Hut, to chance the hurricanes and drifting snow and\r\nto push towards the unknown regions to the east.\r\n\r\nAt the steepest part of the rise we dismissed our helpers and said\r\ngood-bye. McLean and Correll joined me on the sledge and we continued on\r\nto Aladdin's Cave.\r\n\r\nAs we mounted the glacier the wind increased, carrying surface drift\r\nwhich obscured the view to within one hundred yards. It was this which\r\nmade us pass the Cave on the eastern side and pull up on a well-known\r\npatch of snow in a depression to the south of our goal. It was not long\r\nbefore a momentary clearing of the drift showed Aladdin's Cave with its\r\npiles of food-tanks, kerosene, dog biscuit and pemmican, and, to our\r\ndismay, a burberry-clad figure moving about among the accumulation.\r\nMurphy's party were in possession when we expected them to be on the way\r\nsouth to another cave--the Cathedral Grotto--eleven and three-quarter\r\nmiles from the Hut. Of course the rising wind and drift had stopped\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was then 5 P.M., so we did not wait to discuss the evident\r\nproposition as to which of the three parties should occupy the Cave,\r\nbut climbed down into it at once and boiled up hoosh and tea. Borrowing\r\ntobacco from the supporting parties, we reclined at ease, and then in\r\nthat hazy atmosphere so dear to smokers, its limpid blue enhanced by the\r\npale azure of the ice, we introduced the subject of occupation as if it\r\nwere a sudden afterthought.\r\n\r\nIt was soon decided to enlarge the Cave to accommodate five men, the\r\nother four consenting to squeeze into Stillwell's big tent. McLean\r\nvolunteered to join Stillwell's party in the tent, while Correll and I\r\nwere to stay in the Cave with Murphy and company.\r\n\r\nI went outside and selected ten weeks' provisions from the pile of\r\nfood-tanks and piled them beside the sledge. McLean attended to the\r\nthermograph which Bage and I had installed in the autumn. Meanwhile, in\r\na fifty-mile wind, Stillwell and his men erected the tent. Hunter and\r\nLaseron started with picks and shovels to enlarge the Cave, and, working\r\nin relays, we had soon expanded it to eight feet by seven feet.\r\n\r\nThe men from the tent came down to \"high dinner\" at eight o'clock. They\r\nreported weather conditions unimproved and the temperature -3 degrees F.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning I dug my way out and found that the surface drift\r\nhad increased with a wind of fifty-five miles per hour. It was obviously\r\nimpossible to start.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast it was arranged that those outside should have their\r\nmeals separately, digging down at intervals to let us know the state\r\nof the weather. It was not pleasant for us, congested as we were in the\r\nCave, to have visitors sliding down through the opening with a small\r\navalanche of snow in their train. Further, to increase their own\r\ndiscomfort, they arrived covered in snow, and what they were unable\r\nto shake off thawed and wet them, subsequently freezing again to the\r\nconsistency of a starched collar.\r\n\r\nThe opening was, therefore, kept partly closed with a food-tank. The\r\nresult was that a good deal of snow came in, while the hole diminished\r\nin size. For a man to try to crawl out in stiff burberrys appeared as\r\nfutile as for a porcupine to try to go backwards up a canvas hose.\r\n\r\nThe day passed slowly in our impatience. We took turns at reading 'The\r\nVirginian', warmed by a primus stove which in a land of plenty we could\r\nafford to keep going. Later in the afternoon the smokers found that a\r\nmatch would not strike, and the primus went out. Then the man reading\r\nsaid that he felt unwell and could not see the words. Soon several\r\nothers commented on feeling \"queer,\" and two in the sleeping-bags had\r\nfallen into a drowsy slumber. On this evidence even the famous Watson\r\nwould have \"dropped to it,\" but it was some time before it dawned on us\r\nthat the oxygen had given out. Then there was a rush for shovels.\r\nThe snow, ice and food-tank were tightly wedged, at the mouth of the\r\nentrance, and it took some exertion to perforate through to the outside\r\nair with an ice-axe. At once every one speedily recovered. Later,\r\nanother party had a worse experience, not forgetting to leave a warning\r\nnote behind them. We should have done the same.\r\n\r\nThe weather was no better by the evening, and during the night the\r\nminimum thermometer registered -12 degrees F.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock on Sunday morning, November 10, McLean dug down to us\r\nwith the news that the wind had abated to thirty miles per hour with\r\nlight surface drift.\r\n\r\nWe hurried through breakfast, rolled up the bags and started packing the\r\nsledge. Three 100-lb. food-tanks, one 50-lb. bag opened for ready use,\r\nand four gallons of kerosene were selected. Stillwell took for us a\r\n50-lb. food-tank, a 56-lb. tin of wholemeal biscuits, and a gallon\r\nof kerosene. With the 850 lbs. of food, 45 lbs. of kerosene, three\r\nsleeping-bags of 10 lbs. each, a tent of 40 lbs., 86 lbs. of clothing\r\nand personal gear for three men, a cooker, primus, pick, shovel,\r\nice-axe, alpine rope, dip-circle, theodolite, tripod, smaller\r\ninstruments such as aneroid, barometer and thermometer, tools, medical\r\noutfit and sledge-fittings, our total load amounted to nearly 800 lbs.,\r\nand Stillwell's was about the same.\r\n\r\nAll were ready at 9 A.M., and, shaking hands with Murphy's party, who\r\nset off due south, we steered with Stillwell to the south-east. The\r\npreliminary instructions were to proceed south-east from the Cave to a\r\ndistance of eighteen miles and there await the arrival of Dr. Mawson and\r\nhis party, who were to overtake us with their dogteams.\r\n\r\nThe first few miles gave a gradual rise of one hundred feet per mile,\r\nso that, with a heavy load against wind and drift, travelling was very\r\nslow. The wind now dropped to almost calm, and the drift cleared. In the\r\nafternoon progress was hampered by crevasses, which were very frequent,\r\nrunning east and west and from one to twenty feet in width. The wider\r\nones were covered with firm snow-bridges; the snow in places having\r\nformed into granular and even solid ice. What caused most delay were the\r\ndetours of several hundreds of yards which had to be made to find a\r\nsafe crossing over a long, wide crevasse. At 6.30 P.M. we pitched camp,\r\nhaving only made five miles from the Cave.\r\n\r\nWe got away at 9 A.M. the next morning. Throughout the whole journey\r\nwe thought over the same mysterious problem as confronted many another\r\nsledger: Where did the time go to in the mornings? Despite all our\r\nefforts we could not cut down the interval from \"rise and shine\" to the\r\nstart below two hours.\r\n\r\nEarly that day we had our first experience of the treacherous crevasse.\r\nCorrell went down a fissure about three feet wide. I had jumped across\r\nit, thinking the bridge looked thin, but Correll stepped on it and went\r\nthrough. He dropped vertically down the full length of his harness--six\r\nfeet. McLean and I soon had him out. The icy walls fell sheer for about\r\nsixty feet, where snow could be seen in the blue depths. Our respect for\r\ncrevasses rapidly increased after this, and we took greater precautions,\r\nshuddering to think of the light-hearted way we had trudged over the\r\nwider ones.\r\n\r\nAt twelve miles, blue, wind-swept ice gave place to an almost flat snow\r\nsurface. Meanwhile the sky had rapidly clouded over, and the outlook was\r\nthreatening. The light became worse, and the sastrugi indistinguishable.\r\nSuch a phenomenon always occurs on what we came to call a \"snow-blind\r\nday.\" On these days the sky is covered with a white, even pall of cloud,\r\nand cloud and plateau seem as one. One walks into a deep trench or a\r\nsastruga two feet high without noticing it. The world seems one huge,\r\nwhite void, and the only difference between it and the pitch-dark night\r\nis that the one is white and the other black.\r\n\r\nLight snow commenced at 2.30 P.M., the wind rising to forty-five miles\r\nper hour with heavy drift. Thirteen miles out we pitched camp.\r\n\r\nThis, the first \"snow-blind day\" claimed McLean for its victim. By the\r\ntime we were under cover of the tent, his eyes were very sore, aching\r\nwith a throbbing pain. At his request I placed a zinc-cocaine tablet\r\nin each eye. He spent the rest of the day in the darkness of his\r\nsleeping-bag and had his eyes bandaged all next day. Up till then we had\r\nnot worn goggles, but were careful afterwards to use them on the trying,\r\novercast days.\r\n\r\nFor four and a half days the weather was too bad to travel. On the\r\n14th the wind increased and became steady at sixty miles per hour,\r\naccompanied by dense drifting snow. We found it very monotonous lying in\r\nthe tent. As always happens during heavy drifts, the temperature outside\r\nwas high, on this day averaging about 12 degrees F.; inside the tent it\r\nwas above freezing-point, and the accompanying thaw was most unpleasant.\r\n\r\nStillwell's party had pitched their tent about ten paces to the leeward\r\nside of ours, of which stratagem they continually reminded us. Going\r\noutside for food to supply our two small meals per day was an operation\r\nfraught with much discomfort to all. This is what used to happen. The\r\nman on whom the duty fell had to insinuate himself into a bundle of wet\r\nburberrys, and, as soon as he was outside, they froze stiff. When, after\r\na while, he signified his intention of coming in, the other two would\r\ncollect everything to one end of the tent and roll up the floor-cloth.\r\nPlastered with snow, he entered, and, despite every precaution, in\r\nremoving burberrys and brushing himself he would scatter snow about\r\nand increase the general wetness. On these excursions we would visit\r\nStillwell's tent and be hospitably, if somewhat gingerly, admitted; the\r\ninmates drawing back and pulling away their sleeping-bags as from one\r\nwith a fell disease. As a supporting party they were good company, among\r\nother things, supplying us with tobacco ad libitum. When we parted, five\r\ndays after, we missed them very much.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the wind blew harder than ever--that terrible wind,\r\nladen with snow, that blows for ever across the vast, mysterious\r\nplateau, the \"wind that shrills all night in a waste land, where no one\r\ncomes or hath come since the making of the world.\" In the early hours of\r\nthe morning it reached eighty miles per hour.\r\n\r\nNot till 9 next morning did the sky clear and the drift diminish.\r\nConsidering that it had taken us eight days to do thirteen miles, we\r\ndecided to move on the 16th at any cost.\r\n\r\nOur library consisted of 'An Anthology of Australian Verse', Thackeray's\r\n'Vanity Fair' and 'Hints to Travellers' in two volumes. McLean spent\r\nmuch of the time reading the Anthology and I started 'Vanity Fair'. The\r\nlatter beguiled many weary hours in that tent during the journey. I read\r\na good deal aloud and McLean read it afterwards. Correll used to pass\r\nthe days of confinement arranging rations and costs for cycling\r\ntours and designing wonderful stoves and cooking utensils, all on the\r\nsledging, \"cut down weight\" principle.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th we were off at 9 A.M. with a blue sky above and a \"beam\"\r\nwind of thirty-five miles per hour. Up a gentle slope over small\r\nsastrugi the going was heavy. We went back to help Stillwell's party\r\noccasionally, as we were moving a little faster.\r\n\r\nJust after lunch I saw a small black spot on the horizon to the south.\r\nWas it a man? How could Dr. Mawson have got there? We stopped and saw\r\nthat Stillwell had noticed it too. Field-glasses showed it to be a man\r\napproaching, about one and a half miles away. We left our sledges in a\r\nbody to meet him, imagining all kinds of wonderful things such as the\r\npossibility of it being a member of Wild's party--we did not know where\r\nWild had been landed. All the theories vanished when the figure assumed\r\nthe well-known form of Dr. Mawson. He had made a little more south than\r\nwe, and his sledges were just out of sight, about two miles away.\r\n\r\nSoon Mertz and Ninnis came into view with a dog-team, which was\r\nharnessed on to one sledge. All hands pulled the other sledge, and we\r\ncame up fifteen minutes later with Dr. Mawson's camp at eighteen and a\r\nquarter miles. In the good Australian way we sat round a large pot of\r\ntea and after several cups put up our two tents.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy evening with the three tents grouped together and the\r\ndogs securely picketed on the great plateau, forming the only spot on\r\nthe limitless plain. Every one was excited at the prospect of the weeks\r\nahead; the mystery and charm of the \"unknown\" had taken a strange hold\r\non us.\r\n\r\nNinnis and Mertz came into our tent for a short talk before turning in.\r\nMertz sang the old German student song:\r\n\r\n    Studio auf einer Reis'\r\n    Immer sich zu helfen weis\r\n    Immer fort durch's Dick und Dunn\r\n    Schlendert es durch's Leben hin.\r\n\r\nWe were nearly all University graduates. We knew that this would be our\r\nlast evening together till all were safely back at the Hut. No thought\r\nwas farther from our minds than that it was the last evening we would\r\never spend with two companions, who had been our dear comrades for just\r\na year.\r\n\r\nBefore turning into sleeping-bags, a messenger brought me dispatches\r\nfrom the general's tent--a letter on the plateau. This proved to be the\r\ninstructions to the Eastern Coastal Party. Arriving back at the Hut by\r\nJanuary 15, we were to ascertain as much as possible of the coast lying\r\neast of the Mertz Glacier, investigating its broad features and carrying\r\nout the following scientific work: magnetic, biological and geological\r\nobservations, the character, especially the nature and size of the\r\ngrains of ice or snow surfaces, details of sastrugi, topographical\r\nfeatures, heights and distances, and meteorology.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, November 17, we moved on together to the east with the wind\r\nat fifteen miles an hour, the temperature being 9 degrees F. The sun\r\nshone strongly soon after the start, and with four miles to our credit\r\na tent was run up at 1 P.M., and all lunched together on tea, biscuit,\r\nbutter and chocolate. Up to this time we had had only three al fresco\r\nlunches, but, as the weather seemed to be much milder and the benefit of\r\ntea and a rest by the way were so great, we decided to use the tent in\r\nfuture, and did so throughout the journey.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Dr. Mawson's party forged ahead, the dogs romping\r\nalong on a downhill grade. We took the bit in our teeth as we saw them\r\nsitting on their sledges, growing smaller and smaller in front of us. We\r\ncame up with them again as they had waited to exchange a few more words\r\nat a point on the track where a long extent of coast to the east came\r\ninto view.\r\n\r\nHere we bade a final adieu to Dr. Mawson, Mertz and Ninnis. The surface\r\nwas on the down grade towards the east, and with a cheer and farewell\r\nwave they started off, Mertz walking rapidly ahead, followed by Ninnis\r\nand Dr. Mawson with their sledges and teams. They were soon lost to view\r\nbehind the rolling undulations.\r\n\r\nA mile farther on we pitched camp at 8 P.M. in a slight depression just\r\nout of sight of the sea. Every one slept soundly after a good day's\r\npulling.\r\n\r\nNovember 18 was a bright dazzling day, the sky dotted with fleecy\r\nalto-cumulus. At 6 A.M. we were out to find Stillwell's party moving in\r\ntheir tent. There was a rush for shovels to fill the cookers with snow\r\nand a race to boil hoosh.\r\n\r\nAt this camp we tallied up the provisions, with the intention of taking\r\nwhat we might require from Stillwell and proceeding independently of\r\nhim, as he was likely to leave us any day. There were fifty-nine days to\r\ngo until January 15, 1913, the latest date of arrival back at the Hut,\r\nfor which eight weeks' rations were considered to be sufficient. There\r\nwere seven weeks' food on the sledge, so Stillwell handed over another\r\nfifty-pound bag as well as an odd five pounds of wholemeal biscuit. The\r\ntotal amount of kerosene was five gallons, with a bottle of methylated\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nShortly after eight o'clock we caught sight of Dr. Mawson's camp, and\r\nset sail to make up the interval. This we did literally as there was\r\na light westerly breeze--the only west wind we encountered during the\r\nwhole journey.\r\n\r\nThe sledge was provided with a bamboo mast, seven feet high, stepped\r\nbehind the cooker-box and stayed fore and aft with wire. The yard was\r\na bamboo of six feet, slung from the top of the mast, its height being\r\nvaried by altering the length of the slings. The bamboo was threaded\r\nthrough canvas leads in the floor-cloth which provided a spread of\r\nthirty square feet of sail. It was often such an ample area that it had\r\nto be reefed from below.\r\n\r\nWith the grade sloping gently down and the wind freshening, the pace\r\nbecame so hot that the sledge often overran us. A spurious \"Epic of the\r\nEast\" (see 'Adelie Blizzard') records it:\r\n\r\n        Crowd on the sail-\r\n     Let her speed full and free \"on the run\"\r\n   Over knife-edge and glaze, marble polish and pulverized chalk\r\n   The finnesko glide in the race, and there's no time for talk.\r\n       Up hill, down dale,\r\n     It's all in the game and the fun.\r\n\r\nWe rapidly neared Dr. Mawson's camp, but when we were within a few miles\r\nof it, the other party started in a south-easterly direction and were\r\nsoon lost to sight. Our course was due east.\r\n\r\nAt thirty-three and a half miles the sea was in sight, some fine\r\nflat-topped bergs floating in the nearest bay. Suddenly a dark, rocky\r\nnunatak sprang into view on our left. It was a sudden contrast after ten\r\ndays of unchanging whiteness, and we felt very anxious to visit this new\r\nfind. As it was in Stillwell's limited territory we left it to him.\r\n\r\nAccording to the rhymester it was:\r\n\r\n        A rock by the way-\r\n      A spot in the circle of white-\r\n    A grey, craggy spur plunging stark through the deep-splintered ice.\r\n    A trifle! you say, but a glow of warm land may suffice\r\n        To brighten a day\r\n      Prolonged to a midsummer night.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Aladdin's Cave, our sledge-meter had worked quite\r\nsatisfactorily. Just before noon, the casting attaching the\r\nrecording-dial to the forks broke--the first of a series of break-downs.\r\nCorrell bound it up with copper wire and splints borrowed from the\r\nmedical outfit.\r\n\r\nThe wind died away and the sail was of little use. In addition to this,\r\nwe met with a slight up grade on the eastern side of the depression,\r\nour rate diminishing accordingly. At 7 P.M. the tent was pitched in\r\ndead calm, after a day's run of fifteen miles with a full load of almost\r\neight hundred pounds--a record which remained unbroken with us till near\r\nthe end of the outward journey. Looking back, the nunatak and bergs were\r\nstill visible.\r\n\r\nBoth parties were under way at 8 A.M. next day (November 19) on a calm\r\nand sunny morning. The course by sun-compass was set due east.\r\n\r\nAt noon I took a latitude \"shot\" with the three-inch Cary theodolite.\r\nThis little instrument proved very satisfactory and was easily handled\r\nin the cold. In latitude 67 degrees 15' south, forty-six and a half\r\nmiles east of the Hut, we were once more on level country with a high\r\nrise to the north-east and another shallow gully in front.\r\n\r\nA fog which had been moving along the sea-front in an opaque wall\r\ndrifted over the land and enveloped us. Beautiful crystals of ice in the\r\nform of rosettes and small fern-fronds were deposited on the cordage of\r\nthe sail and mast. One moment the mists would clear, and the next, we\r\ncould not see more than a few hundred yards.\r\n\r\nWe now parted with Stillwell, Hodgeman and Close, who turned off to a\r\nrising knoll--Mount Hunt--visible in the north-east, and disappeared in\r\nthe fog.\r\n\r\nAfter the halt at noon the sastrugi became much larger and softer. The\r\nfog cleared at 2 P.M. and the sun came out and shone very fiercely.\r\nA very inquisitive skua gull--the first sign of life we had seen thus\r\nfar--flew around the tent and settled on the snow near by. In the calm,\r\nthe heat was excessive and great thirst attacked us all the afternoon,\r\nwhich I attempted to assuage at every halt by holding snow in my\r\nhands and licking the drops of water off my knuckles----a cold and\r\nunsatisfactory expedient. We travelled without burberrys--at that time\r\nquite a novel sensation--wearing only fleece suits and light woollen\r\nundergarments. Correll pulled for the greater part of the afternoon in\r\nunderclothing alone.\r\n\r\nAt forty-nine and a half miles a new and wonderful panorama opened\r\nbefore us. The sea lay just below, sweeping as a narrow gulf into the\r\ngreat, flat plain of debouching glacier-tongue which ebbed away north\r\ninto the foggy horizon. A small ice-capped island was set like a pearl\r\nin the amethyst water. To the east, the glacier seemed to fuse with the\r\nblue line of the hinterland. Southward, the snowy slope rose quickly,\r\nand the far distance was unseen.\r\n\r\nWe marched for three-quarters of a mile to where a steep down grade\r\ncommenced. Here I made a sketch and took a round of angles to all\r\nprominent features, and the conspicuous, jutting, seaward points of\r\nthe glacier. McLean and Correll were busy making a snow cairn, six\r\nfeet high, to serve as a back-sight for angles to be taken at a higher\r\neminence southward.\r\n\r\nWe set out for the latter, and after going one and a half miles it was\r\nlate enough to camp. During the day we had all got very sunburnt, and\r\nour faces were flushed and smarting painfully. After the long winter at\r\nthe Hut the skin had become more delicate than usual.\r\n\r\nUnder a clear sky, the wind came down during the night at forty-five\r\nmiles per hour, lashing surface drift against the walls of the tent. It\r\nwas not till ten o'clock that the sledge started, breaking a heavy trail\r\nin snow which became more and more like brittle piecrust. There was\r\nat first a slight descent, and then we strained up the eminence to the\r\nsouth over high sastrugi running almost north and south. Capsizes\r\nbecame frequent, and to extricate the heavy sledge from some of the deep\r\nfurrows it was necessary to unload the food-bags. The drift running\r\nover the ground was troublesome when we sat down for a rest, but, in\r\nmarching, our heads were just clear of it.\r\n\r\nIt was a long laborious day, and the four miles indicated by the\r\ninexorable sledge-meter seemed a miserable result. However, near the\r\ntop of the hill there was a rich reward. A small nunatak slanted like a\r\nsteel-blue shadow on the side of a white peak to the south-west. There\r\nwas great excitement, and the sledge slid along its tracks with new\r\nlife. It was rock without a doubt, and there was no one to dispute\r\nit with us. While speculating wildly as to its distance, we came\r\nunexpectedly to the summit of the hill.\r\n\r\nThe wind had subsided, the sky was clear and the sun stood low in the\r\nsouth-west. Our view had widened to a noble outlook. The sea, a delicate\r\nturquoise-blue, lay in the foreground of the low, white, northern\r\nice-cliffs. Away to the east was the dim suggestion of land across the\r\nbed of the glacier, about which circled the southerly highlands of the\r\nplateau, buried at times in the haze of distance. Due south, twenty\r\nmiles away, projecting from the glacier, was another island of rock.\r\nThe nunatak first seen, not many miles to the south-west, was a snowy\r\nmountain streaked with sprouting rock, rising solitary in an indentation\r\nof the land. We honoured our Ship by calling it Aurora Peak, while our\r\ncamp stood on what was thenceforth to be Mount Murchison.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that this was the place for our first depot. I had\r\ndecided, too, to make it the first magnetic station and the point from\r\nwhich to visit and explore Aurora Peak. None of us made any demur over\r\na short halt. Correll had strained his back during the day from pulling\r\ntoo hard, and was troubled with a bleeding nose. My face was very sore\r\nfrom sunburn, with one eye swollen and almost closed, and McLean's eyes\r\nhad not yet recovered from their first attack of snow-blindness.\r\n\r\nNovember 21 was a day in camp. Most of the morning I spent trying, with\r\nCorrell's help, to get the declination needle to set. Its pivot had been\r\ndestroyed in transit and Correll had replaced it by a gramophone needle,\r\nwhich was found too insensitive. There was nothing to do but use the\r\nthree-inch theodolite, which, setting to one degree, would give a good\r\nresult, with a mean of thirty-two settings, for a region with such\r\nvariable magnetic declination. A latitude \"shot\" was made at noon,\r\nand in the afternoon I took a set of dip determinations. These, with a\r\npanoramic sketch from the camp, a round of angles to conspicuous points\r\nand an observation at 5.30 P.M. for time and azimuth completed the day's\r\nwork. Correll did the recording.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, McLean had built an eight-feet snow mound, erected a depot\r\nflag upon it and taken several photographs.\r\n\r\nThe next day was devoted to an excursion to Aurora Peak. The weather\r\nwas, to our surprise, quite clear and calm. Armed with the paraphernalia\r\nfor a day's tour, we set off down the slope. Correll put the primus\r\nstove and the inner pot of the cooker in the ready food-bag, McLean\r\nslung on his camera and the aneroid barometer, while I took my ruck-sack\r\nwith the rations, as well as field-glasses and an ice-axe. In case of\r\ncrevasses, we attached ourselves to an alpine rope in long procession.\r\nAccording to the \"Epic\" it was something like this:\r\n\r\n    We saddled up, adventure-bent;\r\n    Locked up the house--I mean the tent-\r\n    Took \"grub\" enough for three young men\r\n    With appetite to equal ten.\r\n    A day's outing across the vale.\r\n    Aurora Peak! What ho! All hail!\r\n\r\n    We waltzed a'down the silvered slope,\r\n    Connected by an Alpine rope;\r\n    \"Madi\" in front with ice-axe armed,\r\n    For fear that we should feel alarmed.\r\n    Glad was the hour, and--what a lark!\r\n    Explorers three? \"Save the mark!\"\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the nunatak was about to be solved. Apparently it rose\r\nfrom the level of the glacier, as our descent showed its eastern flank\r\nmore clearly outlined. It was three miles to the bottom of the gully,\r\nand the aneroid barometer registered one thousand one hundred and ninety\r\nfeet. The surface was soft and yielding to finnesko crampons, which sank\r\nthrough in places till the snow gripped the knees.\r\n\r\nAscending on the other side we crossed a small crevasse and the peak\r\ntowered above us. The northern side terminated in a perpendicular face\r\nof ice, below which a deep basin had been \"scalloped\" away; evidently\r\nkept clear by eddies of wind. In it lay broken fragments of the\r\noverhanging cliff. The rock was a wide, outcropping band curving steeply\r\nto the summit on the eastern aspect.\r\n\r\nAfter a stiff climb we hurried eagerly to the rock as if it were a mine\r\nof inexhaustible treasure. The boulders were all weathered a bright red\r\nand were much pitted where ferruginous minerals were leached out. The\r\nrock was a highly quartzose gneiss, with black bands of schist running\r\nthrough it. Moss and lichens were plentiful, and McLean collected\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nThe rocky strip was eighty feet wide and three hundred feet high, so,\r\nmaking a cache of the primus, provisions and burberrys, we followed it\r\nup till it became so steep that it was necessary to change to the snow.\r\nThis was in the form of hard neve with patches of ice. I went first,\r\ncutting steps with the ice-axe, and the others followed on the rope. The\r\nlast ten of more than one hundred steps were in an almost vertical face,\r\nwhich gave a somewhat precarious foothold.\r\n\r\nAt 11.30 A.M. we stood on the summit at an altitude of one thousand\r\nseven hundred and fifty feet, while across the valley to the north-east\r\nrose Mount Murchison, one hundred and fourteen feet higher. The top of\r\nthe ridge was quite a knife-edge, with barely space for standing. It\r\nran mainly north and south, dipping in the centre, to curve away sharply\r\nwestward to a higher eminence. At the bend was an inaccessible patch of\r\nrock. The surrounding view was much the same at that on Mount Murchison.\r\n\r\nThe Union Jack and the Australian flag were erected on a bamboo, and\r\nphotographs taken. At the same time, low, threatening clouds rapidly\r\nemerged from the southeast, covering the sun and creating the\r\n\"snow-blind\" light. This was rather alarming as the climb had been\r\ndifficult enough under a clear sky, and the descent was certainly much\r\nmore difficult. So we hastily ate some chocolate and discussed the best\r\nway down.\r\n\r\nProspecting to the north, in search of a long snow ramp which appeared\r\nto run away in that direction, we scrambled down to the edge of a wide\r\nsnowy crevasse full of blue chinks.\r\n\r\nTurning back, we considered the chances of sliding down a steep scoured\r\nhollow to the west and finally decided to descend by the track we had\r\ncut.\r\n\r\nMcLean started off first down the steps and was out of sight in a few\r\nmoments. When the rope tightened, Correll followed him and then I came\r\nlast. It was very ticklish work feeling for the steps below with one's\r\nfeet, and, as we signalled to one another in turn after moving a step,\r\nit took more than an hour to reach a safe position on the rocks. With\r\nevery step I drove my axe into the ice, so that if the others had fallen\r\nthere would still have been a last chance.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to be wasted; light snow was falling with the prospect\r\nof becoming thicker. In the gully the snowfall became heavy, limiting\r\nthe view to within a few hundred yards. We advanced up the hill in\r\nwhat seemed to be the steepest direction, but circled half-way round it\r\nbefore finding out that the course was wrong. Aimlessly trying to place\r\nthe broad flat summit I came across tracks in the snow, which were then\r\ncarefully followed and led to the tent. The wind was rising outside\r\nand the hoosh in steaming mugs was eaten with extra relish in our snug\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nSpecimens were labelled to be deposed and provisions were arranged\r\nfor the rest of the journey. It was evident that we had superfluous\r\nclothing, and so the weight of the kit-bags was scrupulously cut down.\r\nBy the time we crawled into sleeping-bags, everything dispensable was\r\npiled alongside the depot-flag.\r\n\r\nWe slept the sleep of the weary and did not hear the flapping tent nor\r\nthe hissing drift. At 6 A.M. the wind was doing forty miles per hour and\r\nthe air was filled with snow. It must have been a new climate, for by\r\nnoon the sun had unexpectedly broken through, the wind was becoming\r\ngusty and the drift trailed like scud over the surface.\r\n\r\nWith six weeks' food we set off on a new trail after lunch. The way\r\nto the eastern glacier--Mertz Glacier--issued through the mouth of the\r\ngully, which ran in an easterly direction between Aurora Peak and Mount\r\nMurchison. On Mount Murchison ice-falls and crevasses began a short\r\ndistance east of our first line of descent, but yet I thought a slight\r\ndeviation to the east of south would bring us safely into the valley,\r\nand, at the same time, cut off a mile. Alas! it proved to be one of\r\nthose \"best-laid schemes.\"\r\n\r\nThe load commenced to glide so quickly as we were leaving the crest of\r\nthe mountain that Correll and McLean unhitched from the hauling line\r\nand attached themselves by the alpine rope to the rear of the sledge,\r\nbraking its progress. I remained harnessed in front keeping the\r\ndirection. For two miles we were going downhill at a running pace and\r\nthen the slope became suddenly steeper and the sledge overtook me. I had\r\nexpected crevasses, in view of which I did not like all the loose rope\r\nbehind me. Looking round, I shouted to the others to hold back the\r\nsledge, proceeding a few steps while doing so. The bow of the sledge was\r\nalmost at my feet, when--whizz! I was dropping down through space. The\r\nlength of the hauling rope was twenty-four feet, and I was at the end of\r\nit. I cannot say that \"my past life flashed before me.\" I just had time\r\nto think \"Now for the jerk--will my harness hold?\" when there was a\r\nwrench, and I was hanging breathless over the blue depth. Then the most\r\nanxious moment came--I continued to descend. A glance showed me that the\r\ncrevasse was only four feet wide, so the sledge could not follow me, and\r\nI knew with a thankful heart that I was safe. I only descended about\r\ntwo feet more, and then stopped. I knew my companions had pulled up the\r\nsledge and would be anchoring it with the ice-axe.\r\n\r\nI had a few moments in which to take in my surroundings. Opposite to\r\nme was a vertical wall of ice, and below a beautiful blue, darkening\r\nto black in that unseen chasm. On either hand the rift of the crevasse\r\nextended, and above was the small hole in the snow bridge through which\r\nI had shot.\r\n\r\nSoon I heard McLean calling, \"Are you all right?\" And I answered in\r\nwhat he and Correll thought an alarmingly distant voice. They started\r\nenlarging the hole to pull me out, until lumps of snow began to fall\r\nand I had to yell for mercy. Then I felt they were hauling, and slowly I\r\nrose to daylight.\r\n\r\nThe crevasse ran westward along the gully, forcing us to make a detour\r\nthrough a maze of smaller cracks. We had to retreat up the hill in one\r\nplace, throwing off half the load and carrying it on in relays. There\r\nwas a blistering sun and the work was hard. At last the sledge came to\r\na clear run and tobogganed into the snow-filled valley, turning eastward\r\ntowards its outlet.\r\n\r\nAt the evening camp the sledge-meter indicated that our distance\r\neastward of the Hut was sixty miles, one thousand two hundred yards. The\r\nnorthern face of the gully was very broken and great sentinel pillars\r\nof ice stood out among the yawning caves, some of them leaning like\r\nthe tower of Pisa, others having fallen and rolled in shattered\r\nblocks. Filling the vision to the south-west was Aurora Peak, in crisp\r\nsilhouette against a glorious radiant of cirrus cloud.\r\n\r\nReviewing the day through our peaceful smoke-rings, I was rather\r\ncomforted by the fact that the fall into the crevasse had thoroughly\r\ntested my harness. Correll expressed himself as perfectly satisfied with\r\nhis test. McLean seemed to feel somewhat out of it, being the only one\r\nwithout a crevasse experience; which happy state he maintained until the\r\nend, apparently somewhat to his disappointment.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th we broke camp at 9 A.M., continuing down the gully towards\r\nthe glacier. A lofty wall of rocks, set within a frame of ice, was\r\nobserved on our left, one mile away. To it we diverged and found it to\r\nbe gneiss similar to that of Aurora Peak. Several photos were taken.\r\n\r\nThe land was at our back and the margin of the glacier had been crossed.\r\nOnly too soon we were in the midst of terribly crevassed ground, through\r\nwhich one could only thread a slow and zig-zag course. The blue ice was\r\nriven in every direction by gaping quarries and rose smooth and slippery\r\non the ridges which broke the surface into long waves. Shod with\r\ncrampons, the rear of the sledge secured by a tail-rope, we had a\r\ntrying afternoon guiding the load along the narrow ridges of ice with\r\nprecipices on either hand. Fortunately the wind was not above twenty\r\nmiles per hour. As the frivolous \"Epic\" had it:\r\n\r\n    Odds fish! the solid sea is sorely rent,\r\n    And all around we're pent\r\n    With quarries, chasms, pits, depressions vast,\r\n    Their snow-lids overcast.\r\n\r\n    A devious track, all curved and serpentine\r\n    Round snow-lids superfine.\r\n    On jutting brinks and precipices sheer\r\n    Precariously we steer.\r\n\r\nWe pushed on to find a place in which to camp, as there was scarcely\r\nsafe standing-room for a primus stove. At seventy miles the broken ice\r\ngave way to a level expanse of hard sastrugi dotted all over with small\r\nmounds of ice about four feet high. After hoosh, a friendly little\r\nWilson petrel came flying from the northern sea to our tent. We\r\nconsidered it to be a good omen.\r\n\r\nNext day the icy mounds disappeared, to be replaced by a fine, flat\r\nsurface, and the day's march amounted to eleven and a quarter miles.\r\n\r\nAt 11 A.M. four snow petrels visited us, circling round in great\r\ncuriosity. It is a cheerful thing to see these birds amid the lone,\r\ninhospitable ice.\r\n\r\nWe were taking in the surroundings from our position off the land\r\nscanning the far coast to the south for rock and turning round to\r\nadmire the bold contours of Aurora Peak and Mount Murchison at our back.\r\nOccasionally there were areas of rubbly snow, blue ice and crevasses\r\ncompletely filled with snow, of prodigious dimensions, two hundred to\r\nthree hundred yards wide and running as far as the eye could travel.\r\nThe snow filling them was perfectly firm, but, almost always along the\r\nwindward edge, probing with an ice-axe would disclose a fissure. This\r\npart of the Mertz Glacier was apparently afloat.\r\n\r\nThe lucky Wilson petrel came again in the evening. At this stage the\r\ndaily temperatures ranged between 10 degrees F. and near freezing-point.\r\nThe greater part of November 26 was passed in the tent, within another\r\nzone of crevasses. The overcast sky made the light so bad that it became\r\ndangerous to go ahead. At 5.30 P.M. we started, and managed to do five\r\nand a half miles before 8 P.M.\r\n\r\nIt was rather an eventful day, when across the undulating sastrugi there\r\nappeared a series of shallow valleys running eastward. As the valleys\r\napproached closer, the ground sloped down to meet them, their sides\r\nbecoming steeper, buckled and broken. Proceeding ahead on an easterly\r\ncourse, our march came to an abrupt termination on an ice-bluff.\r\n\r\nIn front lay a perfectly flat snow-covered plain--the sea-ice. In point\r\nof fact we had arrived at the eastern side of the Mertz Glacier and were\r\nabout fifteen miles north of the mainland. Old sea-ice, deeply covered\r\nin snow, lay ahead for miles, and the hazy, blue coast sank below the\r\nhorizon in the south-east, running for a time parallel to the course we\r\nwere about to take. It was some time before we realized all this, but at\r\nnoon on the following day there came the first reminder of the proximity\r\nof sea-water.\r\n\r\nAn Adelie penguin, skiing on its breast from the north, surprised us\r\nsuddenly by a loud croak at the rear of the sledge. As astonished as\r\nwe were, it stopped and stared, and then in sudden terror made off. But\r\nbefore starting on its long trek to the land, it had to be captured and\r\nphotographed.\r\n\r\nTo the south the coast was marked by two faces of rock and a short, dark\r\nspur protruding from beneath the ice-cap. As our friendly penguin had\r\nmade off in that direction, we elected to call the place Penguin Point,\r\nintending to touch there on the return journey. During the afternoon\r\nmagnetic dips and a round of angles to the prominences of the mainland\r\nwere taken.\r\n\r\nThe next evidence on the sea-ice question came in the shape of a line\r\nof broken slabs of ice to the north, sticking out of the snow like the\r\nruins of an ancient graveyard. At one hundred and fifteen miles the\r\nline was so close that we left the sledge to investigate it, finding\r\na depression ten feet deep, through which wound a glistening riband of\r\nsea-water. It reminded one of a creek in flat, Australian country, and\r\nthe illusion was sustained by a dark skua gull--in its slow flight much\r\nlike a crow. It was a fissure in old thick sea-ice.\r\n\r\nSunday, and the first day of December, brought good weather and a clear\r\nview of the mainland. A bay opened to the east of Penguin Point, from\r\nwhich the coast trended to the south-east. Across a crack in the sea-ice\r\nwe could just distinguish a low indented line like the glacier-tongue,\r\nwe had already crossed. It might have been a long promontory of land for\r\nall we knew. Behind it was a continuous ice-blink and on our left, to\r\nthe north, a deep blue \"water sky.\" It seemed worth while continuing on\r\nan easterly course approximately parallel with the coast.\r\n\r\nWe were faced by another glacier-tongue; a fact which remained unproven\r\nfor a week at least. From the sea-ice on to the glacier--the Ninnis\r\nGlacier--there was a gentle rise to a prominent knoll of one hundred and\r\nseventy feet. Here our distance from the Hut amounted to one hundred and\r\nfifty-two miles, and the spot was reckoned a good situation for the last\r\ndepot.\r\n\r\nIn taking magnetic observations, it was interesting to find that the\r\n\"dip\" amounted to 87 degrees 44', while the declination, which had\r\nvaried towards the west, swung at this our most northerly station a few\r\ndegrees to the east. We were curving round the South Magnetic Pole. Many\r\npoints on the coast were fixed from an adjoining hill to which Correll\r\nand I trudged through sandy snow, while McLean stayed behind erecting\r\nthe depot-mound, placing a food-bag, kerosene tin, black cloth and\r\nminer's pick on the top.\r\n\r\nWith four weeks' provisions we made a new start to cross the Ninnis\r\nGlacier on December 3, changing course to E. 30 degrees N., in great\r\nwonderment as to what lay ahead. In this new land interest never\r\nflagged. One never could foresee what the morrow would bring forth.\r\n\r\nAcross rolling \"downs\" of soft, billowy snow we floundered for\r\ntwenty-four miles, on the two following days. Not a wind-ripple could\r\nbe seen. We were evidently in a region of comparative calms, which was\r\na remarkable thing, considering that the windiest spot in the world was\r\nless than two hundred miles away.\r\n\r\nAfter several sunny days McLean and I had very badly cracked lips. It\r\nhad been often remarked at the Hut that the standard of humour greatly\r\ndepreciated during the winter and this caused McLean and me many a\r\nphysical pang while sledging, as we would laugh at the least provocation\r\nand open all the cracks in our lips. Eating hard plasmon biscuits was a\r\npainful pleasure. Correll, who was immune from this affliction, tanned\r\nto the rich hue of the \"nut-brown maiden.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 5, at the top of a rise, we were suddenly confronted with a\r\nnew vision--\"Thalassa!\" was our cry, \"the sea!\" but a very different sea\r\nfrom that which brought such joy to the hearts of the wandering Greeks.\r\nUnfolded to the horizon was a plain of pack-ice, thickly studded with\r\nbergs and intersected by black leads of open water. In the north-east\r\nwas a patch of open sea and above it, round to the north, lowering banks\r\nof steel-blue cloud. We had come to the eastern side of Ninnis Glacier.\r\n\r\nAt this point any analogy which could possibly have been found with\r\nWilkes's coastline ceased. It seems probable that he charted as land the\r\nlimits of the pack-ice in 1840.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of exploring this new realm was to be deferred. Even as\r\nwe raised the tent, the wind commenced to whistle and the air became\r\nsurcharged with snow. Three skua gulls squatted a few yards away,\r\nsquawking at our approach, and a few snow petrels sailed by in the\r\ngathering blizzard.\r\n\r\nThrough the 6th, 7th and 8th and most of the 9th it raged, during which\r\ntime we came definitely to the conclusion that as social entertainers\r\nwe were complete failures. We exhausted all the reserve topics of\r\nconversation, discussed our Universities, sports, friends and homes. We\r\neach described the scenery we liked best; notable always for the sunny\r\nweather and perfect calm. McLean sailed again in Sydney Harbour, Correll\r\ncycled and ran his races, I wandered in the South Australian hills or\r\nrowed in the \"eights,\" while the snow swished round the tent and the\r\nwind roared over the wastes of ice.\r\n\r\nAvoiding a few crevasses on the drop to sea-level on December 10, the\r\nsledge was manoeuvred over a tide-crack between glacier and sea-ice. The\r\nlatter was traversed by frequent pressure-ridges; hummocks and broken\r\npinnacles being numerous.\r\n\r\nThe next six days out on the broken sea-ice were full of incident. The\r\nweather was gloriously sunny till the 13th, during which time the sledge\r\nhad to be dragged through a forest of pinnacles and over areas of soft,\r\nsticky slush which made the runners execrable for hours. Ponds of open\r\nwater, by which basked a few Weddell seals, became a familiar sight. We\r\ntried to maintain a south-easterly course for the coast, but miles were\r\nwasted in the tortuous maze of ice--\"a wildering Theban ruin of hummock\r\nand serrac.\"\r\n\r\nThe sledge-meter broke down and gave the ingenious Correll a proposition\r\nwhich he ably solved. McLean and I had a chronic weakness of the eyes\r\nfrom the continual glare. Looking at the other two fellows with their\r\nlong protruding goggles made me think of Banquo's ghost: \"Thou hast no\r\nspeculation in those eyes that thou dost glare with.\"\r\n\r\nI had noticed that some of the tide-cracks had opened widely and, when\r\na blizzard blew on December 13, the thought was a skeleton in my brain\r\ncupboard.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th an Emperor penguin was seen sunning himself by a pool of\r\nwater, so we decided to kill the bird and carry some meat in case of\r\nemergency. McLean found the stomach full of fish and myriads of cestodes\r\nin the intestines.\r\n\r\nBy dint of hard toil over cracks, ridges and jagged, broken blocks, we\r\ncame, by diverging to the south-west, to the junction between shifting\r\npack and fast bay-ice, and even there, we afterwards shuddered to find,\r\nit was at least forty-five miles, as the penguin skis, to the land.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine flat surface on which the sledge ran, and the miles\r\ncommenced to fly by, comparatively speaking. Except for an occasional\r\ndeep rift, whose bottom plumbed to the sea-water, the going was\r\nexcellent. Each day the broken ice on our left receded, the mainland to\r\nthe south grew closer and traces of rock became discernible on the low,\r\nfractured cliffs.\r\n\r\nOn December 17 a huge rocky bluff--Horn Bluff--stood out from the shore.\r\nIt had a ram-shaped bow like a Dreadnought battleship and, adjoining it,\r\nthere were smaller outcrops of rock on the seaward ice-cliffs. On\r\nits eastern side was a wide bay with a well-defined cape--Cape\r\nFreshfield--at the eastern extremity about thirty miles away.\r\n\r\nThe Bluff was a place worth exploring. At a distance of more than\r\nfifteen miles, the spot suggested all kinds of possibilities, and in\r\ncouncil we argued that it was useless to go much farther east, as to\r\ntouch at the land would mean a detour on the homeward track and time\r\nwould have to be allowed for that.\r\n\r\nAt a point two hundred and seventy miles from the Hut, in latitude 68\r\ndegrees 18' S., longitude 150 degrees 12' E., we erected our \"farthest\r\neast\" camp on December 18, after a day's tramp of eighteen miles. Here,\r\nmagnetic \"dips\" and other observations were made throughout the morning\r\nof the 19th. It was densely overcast, with sago snow falling, but by\r\n3 P.M. of the same day the clouds had magically cleared and the first\r\nstage of the homeward journey had commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI HORN BLUFF AND PENGUIN POINT\r\n\r\nby C. T. MADIGAN\r\n\r\n\r\n       What thrill of grandeur ours\r\n    When first we viewed the column'd fell!\r\n    What idle, lilting verse can tell\r\n       Of giant fluted towers,\r\n    O'er-canopied with immemorial snow\r\n    And riven by a glacier's azure flow?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we neared Horn Bluff, on the first stage of our homeward march, the\r\nupper layers of snow were observed to disappear, and the underlying\r\nice became thinner; in corrugated sapphire plains with blue reaches of\r\nsparkling water. Cracks bridged with flimsy snow continually let one\r\nthrough into the water. McLean and I both soaked our feet and once I\r\nwas immersed to the thighs, having to stop and put on dry socks and\r\nfinnesko. It was a chilly process allowing the trousers to dry on me.\r\n\r\nThe mountain, pushing out as a great promontory from the coast amid the\r\nfast sea-ice, towered up higher as our sledge approached its foot. A\r\ngreat shadow was cast on the ice, and, when more than a mile away, we\r\nleft the warm sunshine.\r\n\r\nAwed and amazed, we beheld the lone vastness of it all and were mute.\r\nRising out of the flat wilderness over which we had travelled was a\r\nmammoth vertical barrier of rock rearing its head to the skies above.\r\nThe whole face for five miles was one magnificent series of organ-pipes.\r\nThe deep shade was heightened by the icy glare beyond it. Here was\r\nindeed a Cathedral of Nature, where the \"still, small voice\" spoke amid\r\nan ineffable calm.\r\n\r\nFar up the face of the cliff snow petrels fluttered like white\r\nbutterflies. It was stirring to think that these majestic heights had\r\ngazed out across the wastes of snow and ice for countless ages,\r\nand never before had the voices of human beings echoed in the great\r\nstillness nor human eyes surveyed the wondrous scene.\r\n\r\nFrom the base of the organ-pipes sloped a mass of debris; broken blocks\r\nof rock of every size tumbling steeply to the splintered hummocks of the\r\nsea-ice.\r\n\r\nStanding out from the top of this talus-slope were several white\r\n\"beacons,\" up to which we scrambled when the tent was pitched. This\r\nwas a tedious task as the stones were ready to slide down at the\r\nleast touch, and often we were carried down several yards by a general\r\nmovement. Wearing soft finnesko, we ran the risk of getting a crushed\r\nfoot among the large boulders. Amongst the rubble were beds of clay, and\r\nstreams of thaw-water trickled down to the surface of a frozen lake.\r\n\r\nAfter rising two hundred feet, we stood beneath the beacons which loomed\r\nabove to a height of one hundred and twenty-eight feet. The organ-pipes\r\nwere basaltic** in character but, to my great joy, I found the beacons\r\nwere of sedimentary rock. After a casual examination, the details were\r\nleft till the morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** To be exact the igneous rook was a very thick sill of dolerite,\r\n\r\nThat night we had a small celebration on raisins, chocolate and\r\napple-rings, besides the ordinary fare of hoosh, biscuit and cocoa.\r\nSeveral times we were awakened by the crash of falling stones. Snow\r\npetrels had been seen coming home to their nests in the beacons, which\r\nwere weathered out into small caves and crannies. From the camp we could\r\nhear their harsh cries.\r\n\r\nThe scene in the morning sun was a brilliant one. The great columnar\r\nrampart ran almost north and south and the tent was on its eastern\r\nside. So what was in dark shadow on the day before was now radiantly\r\nillumined.\r\n\r\nCorrell remained behind on the sea-ice with a theodolite to take heights\r\nof the various strata. McLean and I, armed with aneroid, glasses,\r\nruck-sack, geological hammer (ice-axe) and camera, set out for the foot\r\nof the talus-slope.\r\n\r\nThe beacons were found to be part of a horizontal, stratified series\r\nof sandstones underlying the igneous rock. There were bands of coarse\r\ngravel and fine examples of stream-bedding interspersed with seams of\r\ncarbonaceous shale and poor coal. Among the debris were several pieces\r\nof sandstone marked by black, fossilized plant-remains. The summits\r\nof the beacons were platforms of very hard rock, baked by the volcanic\r\noverflow. The columns, roughly hexagonal and weathered to a dull-red,\r\nstood above in sheer perpendicular lines of six hundred and sixty feet\r\nin altitude.\r\n\r\nAfter taking a dozen photographs of geological and general interest and\r\nstuffing the sack and our pockets with specimens, we picked a track down\r\nthe shelving talus to a lake of fresh water which was covered with a\r\nsuperficial crust of ice beneath which the water ran. The surface was\r\neasily broken and we fetched the aluminium cover of the cooker, filling\r\nit with three gallons of water, thus saving kerosene for almost a day.\r\n\r\nAfter McLean had collected samples of soil, lichens, algae and moss, and\r\nall the treasures had been labelled, we lunched and harnessed-up once\r\nmore for the homeward trail.\r\n\r\nFor four miles we ran parallel to the one-thousand-foot wall of Horn\r\nBluff meeting several boulders stranded on the ice, as well as the\r\nfragile shell of a tiny sea-urchin. The promontory was domed with snow\r\nand ice, more than one thousand two hundred feet above sea-level. From\r\nit streamed a blue glacier overflowing through a rift in the face. Five\r\nmiles on our way, the sledge passed from frictionless ice to rippled\r\nsnow and with a march of seven miles, following lunch, we pitched camp.\r\n\r\nEvery one was tired that night, and our prayer to the Sleep Merchant in\r\nthe book of Australian verse was for:\r\n\r\n    Twenty gallons of balmy sleep,\r\n    Dreamless, and deep, and mild,\r\n    Of the excellent brand you used to keep\r\n    When I was a little child.\r\n\r\nFor three days, December 22, 23 and 24, the wind soughed at thirty miles\r\nper hour and the sky was a compact nimbus, unveiling the sun at rare\r\nmoments. Through a mist of snow we steered on a north-west course\r\ntowards the one-hundred-and-fifty-two mile depot. The wind was from the\r\nsouth-east true, and this information, with hints from the sun-compass,\r\ngave us the direction. With the sail set, on a flat surface, among\r\nghostly bergs and over narrow leads we ran for forty-seven miles with\r\nscarce a clear view of what lay around. The bergs had long ramps of snow\r\nleading close up to their summits on the windward side and in many cases\r\nthe intervals between these ramps and the bergs were occupied by deep\r\nmoats.\r\n\r\nOne day we were making four knots an hour under all canvas through thick\r\ndrift. Suddenly, after a gradual ascent, I was on the edge of a moat,\r\nthirty feet deep. I shouted to the others and, just in time, the sledge\r\nwas slewed round on the very brink.\r\n\r\nWe pushed on blindly:\r\n\r\n    The toil of it none may share;\r\n    By yourself must the way be won\r\n    Through fervid or frozen air\r\n    Till the overland journey's done.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day! The day that ever reminds one of the sweet story of old,\r\nthe lessons of childhood, the joys of Santa Claus--the day on which the\r\nthoughts of the wildest wanderer turn to home and peace and love. All\r\nthe world was cheerful; the sun was bright, the air was calm. It was\r\nthe hometrail, provisions were in plenty, the sledge was light and our\r\nhearts lighter.\r\n\r\nThe eastern edge of Ninnis Glacier was near, and, leaving the sea-ice,\r\nwe were soon straining up the first slope, backed by a line of ridges\r\ntrending north-east and south-west, with shallow valleys intervening. On\r\nthe wind-swept crests there were a few crevasses well packed with snow.\r\n\r\nIt was a day's work of twelve miles and we felt ready for Christmas\r\ndinner. McLean was cook and had put some apple-rings to soak in the\r\ncooker after the boil-up at lunch. Beyond this and the fact that he\r\ntook some penguin-meat into the tent, he kept his plans in the deepest\r\nmystery. Correll and I were kept outside making things snug and taking\r\nthe meteorological observations, until the word came to enter. When at\r\nlast we scrambled in, a delicious smell diffused through the tent, and\r\nthere was a sound of frying inside the cooker-pot. We were presented\r\nwith a menu which read:\r\n\r\n              \"Peace on earth, good will to men.\"\r\n\r\n   Xmas 1912                               KING GEORGE V. LAND\r\n                                 200 miles east of Winter Quarters.\r\n\r\n                          MENU DU DINER\r\n                           Hors d'oeuvre\r\n  Biscuit de plasmon                  Ration du lard glace\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Entree\r\n  Monsieur l'Empereur Pingouin fricasse\r\n\r\n                         Piece de Resistance\r\n  Pemmican naturel a l'Antarctique\r\n\r\n                              Dessert\r\n  Hotch-potch de pommes et de raisins\r\n  Chocolat au sucre glaxone\r\n  Liqueur bien ancienne de l'Ecosse\r\n\r\n                Cigarettes                      Tabac\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hors d'oeuvre of bacon ration was a welcome surprise. McLean had\r\ncarried the tin unknown to us up till this moment. The penguin, fried\r\nin lumps of fat taken from the pemmican, and a little butter, was\r\ndelicious. In the same pot the hoosh was boiled and for once we noted\r\nan added piquancy. Next followed the plum-pudding--dense mixture of\r\npowdered biscuit, glaxo, sugar, raisins and apple-rings, surpassing the\r\nfinest, flaming, holly-decked, Christmas creation.\r\n\r\nThen came the toasts. McLean produced the whisky from the medical kit\r\nand served it out, much diluted, in three mugs. There was not three\r\nounces in all, but it flavoured the water.\r\n\r\nI was asked to call \"The King.\" McLean proposed \"The Other Sledgers\" in\r\na noble speech, wishing them every success; and then there were a\r\nfew drops left to drink to \"Ourselves,\" whom Correll eulogized to our\r\ncomplete satisfaction. We then drew on the meagre supply of cigarettes\r\nand lay on our bags, feeling as comfortable as the daintiest epicure\r\nafter a twelve-course dinner, drinking his coffee and smoking his cigar.\r\n\r\nWe talked till twelve o'clock, and then went outside to look at the\r\nmidnight sun, shining brightly just above the southern horizon. Turning\r\nin, we were once more at home in our dreams.\r\n\r\nBy a latitude shot at noon on Boxing Day, I found that our position\r\nwas not as far north as expected. The following wind had been probably\r\nslightly east of south-east and too much westing had been made. From\r\na tangle of broken ridges whose surface was often granular,\r\nhalf-consolidated ice, the end of the day opened up a lilac plain of\r\nsea-ice ahead. We were once more on the western side of Ninnis Glacier\r\nand the familiar coast of Penguin Point, partly hidden by an iceberg,\r\nsprang into view. The depot hill to the north-west could be recognized,\r\ntwenty miles away, across a wide bay. By hooch-time we had found a\r\nsecure path to the sea-ice, one hundred and eighty feet below.\r\n\r\nThe wind sprang up opportunely on the morning of the 27th, and the sun\r\nwas serene in a blue sky. Up went the sail and with a feather-weight\r\nload we strode off for the depot eighteen miles distant. Three wide\r\nrifts in the sea-ice exercised our ingenuity during the day's march, but\r\nby the time the sun was in the south-west the sledge was sawing through\r\nthe sandy snow of the depot hill. It was unfortunate that the food of\r\nthis depot had been cached so far out of our westerly course, as the\r\ntime expended in recovering it might have been profitably given to\r\na survey of the mainland east of Penguin Point. At 6.20 P.M., after\r\neighteen and a quarter miles, the food-bag was sighted on the mound, and\r\nthat night the dinner at our one-hundred-and-fifty-two-mile depot was\r\nmarked by some special innovations.\r\n\r\nPenguin Point, thirty miles away, bore W. 15 degrees S., and next day\r\nwe made a bid for it by a march of sixteen miles. There was eleven days'\r\nration on the sledge to take us to Mount Murchison, ninety miles away;\r\nconsequently the circuitous route to the land was held to be a safe\r\n\"proposition.\"\r\n\r\nMany rock faces became visible, and I was able to fix numerous prominent\r\npoints with the theodolite.\r\n\r\nAt three miles off the coast, the surface became broken by ridges, small\r\nbergs and high, narrow cupolas of ice surrounded by deep moats. One of\r\nthese was very striking. It rose out of a wind-raked hollow to a height\r\nof fifty feet; just the shape of an ancient Athenian helmet. McLean took\r\na photograph.\r\n\r\nAs at Horn Bluff, the ice became thinner and freer of snow as we drew\r\nnear the Point. The rocky wall under which the tent was raised proved to\r\nbe three hundred feet high, jutting out from beneath the slopes of ice.\r\nFrom here the coast ran almost south on one side and north-west on the\r\nother. On either hand there were dark faces corniced with snow.\r\n\r\nThe next day was devoted to exploration. Adelie penguins waddled about\r\nthe tide-crack over which we crossed to examine the rock, which was of\r\ncoarse-grained granite, presenting great, vertical faces. Hundreds of\r\nsnow petrels flew about and some stray skua gulls were seen.\r\n\r\nNear the camp, on thick ice, were several large blocks of granite which\r\nhad floated out from the shore and lay each in its pool of thaw-water,\r\ncovered with serpulae and lace coral.\r\n\r\nCorrell, our Izaak Walton, had brought a fishing-line and some\r\npenguin-meat. He stopped near the camp fishing while McLean and I\r\ncontinued down the coast, examining the outcrops. The type of granite\r\nremained unchanged in the numerous exposures.\r\n\r\nI had noticed a continuous rustling sound for some time and found at\r\nlength that it was caused by little streams of ice-crystals running\r\ndown the steep slopes in cascades, finally pouring out in piles on the\r\nsea-ice. The partial thaw in the sunlight causes the semi-solid ice to\r\nbreak up into separate grains. Sometimes whole areas of the surface, in\r\ndelicate equilibrium, would suddenly flow rapidly away.\r\n\r\nFor three miles we walked, and as the next four miles of visible coast\r\npresented no extensive outcrops, we turned back for lunch.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, on the summit of the Point, it was found that an\r\nuneven rocky area, about a quarter of a mile wide, ran backwards to the\r\nice-falls of the plateau. The surface was very broken and weathered,\r\ncovered in patches by abundant lichens and mosses. Fossicking round\r\nin the gravel, Correll happened on some tiny insect-like mites living\r\namongst the moss or on the moist under side of slabs of stone. This set\r\nus all insect-hunting. Alcohol was brought in a small bottle from the\r\ntent, and into this they were swept in myriads with a camel's-hair\r\nbrush. From the vantage-point of a high rock in the neighbourhood the\r\nlong tongue of Mertz Glacier could be seen running away to the north.\r\n\r\nAt 8.30 A.M., on New Year's Eve, we set off for another line of rocks\r\nabout four miles away to the west. There were two masses forming an\r\nangle in the ice-front and consisting of two main ridges rising to a\r\nheight of two hundred and fifty feet, running back into the ice-cap for\r\na mile, and divided by a small glacier.\r\n\r\nThis region was soon found to be a perfect menagerie of life. Seals lay\r\nabout dozing peacefully by the narrow lanes of water. Adelie penguins\r\nstrutted in procession up and down the little glacier. To reach his\r\nrookery, a penguin would leap four feet on to a ledge of the ice-foot,\r\npainfully pad up the glassy slope and then awkwardly scale the rocks\r\nuntil he came to a level of one hundred and fifty feet. Here he took\r\nover the care of a chick or an egg, while the other bird went to fish.\r\nSkua gulls flew about, continually molesting the rookeries. One area of\r\nthe rocks was covered by a luxuriant growth of green moss covering guano\r\nand littered skeletons--the site of a deserted rookery.\r\n\r\nCorrell and I went up to where the ridges converged, selecting numerous\r\nspecimens of rock and mineral and finding thousands of small red mites\r\nin the moist gravel. Down on the southern ridge we happened on a Wilson\r\npetrel with feathered nestlings. At this point McLean came along from\r\nthe west with the news of silver-grey petrels and Cape pigeons nesting\r\nin hundreds. He had secured two of each species and several eggs. This\r\nwas indeed a discovery, as the eggs of the former birds had never before\r\nbeen found. Quite close to us were many snow petrels in all kinds of\r\nunexpected crevices. The light was too dull for photographing, but,\r\nwhile I took magnetic \"dips\" on the following morning, McLean visited\r\nthe silver-grey petrels and Cape pigeons and secured a few \"snaps.\"\r\n\r\nThe last thing we did before leaving the mainland was to kill two\r\npenguins and cut off their breasts and this meat was, later, to serve us\r\nin good stead.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Mertz Glacier at any time would have been an unpleasant\r\nundertaking, but to go straight to Mount Murchison (the site of our\r\nfirst depot on the outward journey) from Penguin Point meant spanning it\r\nin a long oblique line. It was preferable to travel quickly and safely\r\nover the sea-ice on a north-westerly course, which, plotted on the\r\nchart, intersected our old one-hundred-mile camp on the eastern margin\r\nof the glacier; then to cross by the route we already knew.\r\n\r\nBy January 2 we had thrown Penguin Point five miles behind, and a spell\r\nof unsettled weather commenced; in front lay a stretch of fourteen miles\r\nover a good surface. The wind was behind us, blowing between thirty and\r\nforty miles per hour, and from an overcast sky light snow was falling.\r\nFortunately there were fleeting glimpses of the sun, by which the course\r\ncould be adjusted. Towards evening the snow had thickened, but thanks to\r\nthe splendid assistance afforded by a sail, the white jutting spurs of\r\nthe edge of Mertz Glacier were dimly visible.\r\n\r\nA blizzard took possession of the next day till 7 P.M., when we\r\nall sallied out and found the identical gully in which was the\r\none-hundred-mile camp of the outward journey. The light was still bad\r\nand the sky overcast, so the start was postponed till next morning.\r\n\r\nThere was food for five days on a slightly reduced ration and the depot\r\non Mount Murchison was forty miles away.\r\n\r\nOnce we had left the sea-ice and stood on the glacier, Aurora Peak with\r\nits black crest showed through the glasses. Once there, the crevasses we\r\nmost dreaded would be over and the depot easily found.\r\n\r\nA good fourteen and a quarter miles slipped by on January 4--a fine day.\r\nOn January 5 the \"plot began to thicken.\" The clouds hung above like a\r\nblanket, sprinkling light snow. The light was atrocious, and a few open\r\nrents gave warning of the western zone of pitfalls. All the while there\r\nwas a shifting spectral chaos of whiteness which seemed to benumb the\r\nfaculties and destroy one's sense of reality. We decided to wait for a\r\nchange in the weather.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the snow ceased, and by lunch time on the 6th the\r\nsledge-meter recorded ten miles. The strange thing was that the firm\r\nsastrugi present on the outward journey were now covered inches in snow,\r\nwhich became deeper as we marched westward.\r\n\r\nIt was now a frequent occurrence for one of us to pitch forward with his\r\nfeet down a hidden crevasse, sometimes going through to the waist. The\r\ntravelling was most nerve-racking. When a foot went through the crust\r\nof snow, it was impossible to tell on which side of the crevasse one\r\nhappened to be, or in what direction it ran. The only thing to do was to\r\ngo ahead and trust in Providence.\r\n\r\nAt last we landed the sledge on a narrow ridge of hard snow, surrounded\r\nby blue, gaping pits in a pallid eternity of white. It was only when the\r\ntent was pitched that a wide quarry was noticed a few yards away from\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nIt was now fourteen miles to the top of Mount Murchison and we had only\r\ntwo more days' rations and one and a half pounds of penguin-meat.\r\n\r\nOn January 7th the light was worse than ever and snow fell. It was only\r\nsix miles across the broken country between us and the gully between Mt.\r\nMurchison and Aurora Peak, where one could travel with some surety.\r\nA sharp look-out was kept, and towards 11 P.M. a rim of clear sky\r\novertopped the southern horizon. We knew the sun would curve round into\r\nit at midnight, so all was made ready for marching.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun's disc emerged into the rift there was light; but dim, cold\r\nand fleeting. The smallest irregularity on the surface threw a\r\nshadow hundreds of yards long. The plain around was a bluish-grey\r\nchecquer-board of light and shade; ahead, sharp and clear against the\r\nleaden sky, stood beautiful Aurora Peak, swathed in lustrous gold--the\r\nchariot of the goddess herself. The awful splendour of the scene tended\r\nto depress one and make the task more trying. I have never felt\r\nmore nervous than I did in that ghostly light in the tense silence,\r\nsurrounded by the hidden horror of fathomless depths. All was covered\r\nwith a uniform layer of snow, growing deeper and heavier at every step.\r\nI was ahead and went through eight times in about four miles. The\r\ndanger lay in getting the sledge and one, two, or all of us on a weak\r\nsnow-bridge at the same time. As long as the sledge did not go down we\r\nwere comparatively safe.\r\n\r\nAt 1.30 A.M. the sun was obscured and the light waned to dead white.\r\nStill we went on, as the entrance of the gully between Aurora Peak\r\nand Mount Murchison was near at hand and we had a mind to get over the\r\ndanger-zone before a snowstorm commenced.\r\n\r\nBy 5.30 A.M. we breathed freely on \"terra firma,\" even though one sunk\r\nthrough a foot of snow to feel it. It had taken six hours to do the last\r\nfive and three-quarter miles, and, being tired out with the strain on\r\nmuscles and nerves, we raised the tent, had a meal, and then slept till\r\nnoon on the 8th. It was eight miles to the depot, five miles up the\r\ngully and three miles to the summit of Mount Murchison; and no one\r\ndoubted for a moment that it could not be done in a single day's march.\r\n\r\nAdvancing up the gully after lunch, we found that the surface became\r\nsofter, and we were soon sinking to the knees at every step. The\r\nrunners, too, sank till the decking rested on the snow, and it was as\r\nmuch as we could do to shift the sledge, with a series of jerks at every\r\nstep. At 6 P.M. matters became desperate. We resolved to make a depot of\r\neverything unnecessary, and to relay it up the mountain afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe sledge-meter, clogged with snow and almost submerged, was taken\r\noff and stood up on end to mark a depot, whilst a pile was made of the\r\ndip-circle, theodolite and tripod, pick, alpine rope, ice-axe, all the\r\nmineral and biological specimens and excess clothing.\r\n\r\nEven thus lightened, we could scarcely move the sledge, struggling on,\r\nsinking to the thighs in the flocculent deluge. Snow now began to fall\r\nso thickly that it was impossible to see ahead.\r\n\r\nAt 7 P.M. we finished up the last scraps of pemmican and cocoa. Biscuit,\r\nsugar and glaxo had given out at the noon meal. There still remained one\r\nand a half pounds of penguin meat, several infusions of tea and plenty\r\nof kerosene for the primus.\r\n\r\nWe staggered on till 10.30 P.M., when the weather became so dense that\r\nthe sides of the gully were invisible. Tired out, we camped and had some\r\ntea. In eight hours we had only made four and a half miles, and there\r\nwas still the worst part to come.\r\n\r\nIn our exhausted state we slept till 11 P.M. of January 9, awaking to\r\nfind the sky densely overcast and a light fog in the air. During a rift\r\nwhich opened for a few minutes there was a short glimpse of the rock on\r\nAurora Peak. Shredding half the penguin-meat, we boiled it up and found\r\nthe stew and broth excellent.\r\n\r\nAt 1.30 A.M. we started to struggle up the gully once more, wading along\r\nin a most helpless fashion, with breathing spells every ten yards or\r\nless. Snow began to fall in such volume that at last it was impossible\r\nto keep our direction with any certainty. The only thing to do was to\r\nthrow up the tent as a shelter and wait. This we did till 4.30 A.M.; but\r\nthere must have been a cloud-burst, for the heavy flakes toppled on to\r\nthe tent like tropical rain. We got into sleeping-bags, and tried to be\r\npatient and to forget that we were hungry.\r\n\r\nApparently, during our seven weeks' absence, the local precipitation had\r\nbeen almost continual, and snow now lay over this region in stupendous\r\namount. Even when one sank three feet, it was not on to the firm\r\nsastrugi over which we had travelled out of the valley on the outward\r\njourney, for these lay still deeper. It was hoped that the \"snowdump\"\r\ndid not continue over the fifty miles to the Hut, but we argued that on\r\nthe windy plateau this could scarcely be possible.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that without any more food, through this bottomless,\r\nyielding snow, we could never haul the sledge up to the depot, a rise of\r\none thousand two hundred feet in three miles. One of us must go up and\r\nbring food back, and I decided to do so as soon as the weather cleared.\r\n\r\nWe found the wait for clearer weather long and trying with empty\r\nstomachs. As the tobacco-supply still held out, McLean and I found great\r\nsolace in our pipes. All through the rest of the day and till 5 P.M. of\r\nthe next, January 10, there was not a rift in the opaque wall of flakes.\r\nThen to our intense relief the snow stopped, the clouds rolled to\r\nthe north, and, in swift transformation--a cloudless sky with bright\r\nsunshine! With the rest of the penguin-meat--a bare half-pound--we had\r\nanother thin broth. Somewhat fortified, I took the food-bag and shovel,\r\nand left the tent at 5.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nOften sinking to the thighs, I felt faint at the first exertion. The\r\ntent scarcely seemed to recede as I toiled onwards towards the first\r\nsteep slope. The heavy mantle of snow had so altered the contours of the\r\nside of the gully that I was not sure of the direction of the top of the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nResting every hundred yards, I floundered on hour after hour, until, on\r\narriving at a high point, I saw a little shining mound standing up on\r\na higher point, a good mile to the east. After seven hours' wading I\r\nreached it and found that it was the depot.\r\n\r\nTwo feet of the original eight-foot mound projected above the surface,\r\nwith the bamboo pole and a wire-and-canvas flag rising another eighteen\r\ninches. On this, a high isolated mountain summit, six feet of snow had\r\nactually accumulated. How thankful I was that I had brought a shovel!\r\n\r\nAt seven feet I \"bottomed\" on the hard snow, without result. Then,\r\nrunning a tunnel in the most probable direction, I struck with the\r\nshovel the kerosene tin which was on the top of the food-bag. On opening\r\nthe bag, the first items to appear were sugar, butter and biscuits; the\r\nnext quarter of an hour I shall not forget!\r\n\r\nI made a swag of five days' provisions, and, taking a direct route,\r\nattacked the three miles downhill in lengths of one hundred and fifty\r\nyards. Coming in sight of the tent, I called to my companions to thaw\r\nsome water for a drink. So slow was progress that I could speak to them\r\na quarter of an hour before reaching the tent. I had been away eleven\r\nand a half hours, covering about seven miles in all.\r\n\r\nMcLean and Correll were getting anxious about me. They said that they\r\nhad felt the cold and were unable to sleep. Soon I had produced the\r\npemmican and biscuit, and a scalding hoosh was made. The other two\r\nhad had only a mug of penguin broth each in three days, and I had only\r\nbroken my fast a few hours before them.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal, McLean and Correll started back to the cache, two\r\nmiles down the gully, to select some of the geological and biological\r\nspecimens and to fetch a few articles of clothing. The instruments,\r\nthe greater part of the collection of rocks, crampons, sledge-meter and\r\nother odds and ends were all left behind. Coming back with the loads\r\nslung like swags they found that by walking in their old footsteps they\r\nmade fair progress.\r\n\r\nBy 8 P.M. all had rested, every unnecessary fitting had been stripped\r\noff the sledge and the climb to the depot commenced. I went ahead in my\r\nold trail, Correll also making use of it; while McLean broke a track for\r\nhimself. The work was slow and heavy; nearly six hours were spent doing\r\nthose three miles.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely evening; the yellow sun drifting through orange\r\ncloudlets behind Aurora Peak. We were in a more appreciative mood than\r\non the last midnight march, exulting in the knowledge of ten days'\r\nprovisions at hand and fifty-three miles to go to reach the Hut.\r\n\r\nIn the manner of the climate, a few wisps of misty rack came sailing\r\nfrom the south-east, the wind rose, snow commenced to fall and a\r\nblizzard held sway for almost three days. It was just as well that we\r\nhad found that depot when we did.\r\n\r\nThe fifty-three miles to the Hut melted away in the pleasures of\r\nanticipation. The first two miles, on the morning of January 14, gave us\r\nsome strenuous work, but they were luxurious in comparison with what we\r\nexpected; soon, however, the surface rapidly and permanently improved. A\r\nforty-mile wind from the south-east was a distinct help, and by the end\r\nof the day we had come in sight of the nunatak first seen after leaving\r\nthe Hut (Madigan Nunatak).\r\n\r\nIn two days forty miles lay behind. Down the blue ice-slopes in slippery\r\nfinnesko, and Aladdin's Cave hove in sight. We tumbled in, to be\r\nassailed by a wonderful odour which brought back orchards, shops,\r\npeople--a breath of civilization. In the centre of the floor was a pile\r\nof oranges surmounted by two luscious pineapples. The Ship was in! There\r\nwas a bundle of letters--Bage was back from the south--Wild had been\r\nlanded one thousand five hundred miles to the west--Amundsen had reached\r\nthe Pole! Scott was remaining in the Antarctic for another year. How we\r\nshouted and read all together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII WITH STILLWELL'S AND BICKERTON'S PARTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Madigan's party on November 19, when forty-six miles from the\r\nHut, Stillwell, Hodgeman and Close of the Near-Eastern Party diverged\r\ntowards a dome-shaped mountain--Mount Hunt. A broad valley lay\r\nbetween their position on the falling plateau and this eminence to the\r\nnorth-east. Looking across, one would think that the depression was\r\nslight, but the party found by aneroid that their descent was one\r\nthousand five hundred feet into a gully filled with soft, deep snow.\r\nAfter skimming the polished sastrugi of the uplands, the sledge ran\r\nheavily in the yielding drifts. Then a gale of wind rose behind them\r\njust as the ascent on the other side commenced, and was a valuable aid\r\nin the pull to the summit.\r\n\r\nFrom the highest point or cap of what proved to be a promontory, a wide\r\nseascape dotted with bergs was unfolded to the north. To the west the\r\neastern cape of Commonwealth Bay was visible, and sweeping away to\r\nthe north-east was the Mertz Glacier with sheer, jutting headlands\r\nsucceeding one another into the distance. True bearings to these points\r\nwere obtained from the camp, and, subsequently, with the help of an\r\nobservation secured on the 'Aurora' during the previous year, the\r\ntrend of the glacier-tongue was determined. Hodgeman made a series of\r\nillustrative sketches.\r\n\r\nOn November 21 the party commenced the return journey, moving directly\r\ntowards Madigan Nunatak to the south-west. This nunatak had been sighted\r\nfor the first time on the outward march, and there was much speculation\r\nas to what the rock would prove to be. A gradual descent for seven miles\r\nbrought them on to a plain, almost at sea-level, continuous with the\r\nvalley they had crossed on the 19th further to the east. On the far side\r\nof the plain a climb was commenced over some ice-spurs, and then a broad\r\nfield of crevasses was encountered, some of which attained a width of\r\nfifty yards. Delayed by these and by unfavourable weather, they did not\r\nreach Madigan Nunatak until the evening of November 20.\r\n\r\nThe outcrop--a jagged crest of rock--was found to be one hundred and\r\nsixty yards long and thirty yards wide, placed at an altitude of two\r\nthousand four hundred feet above sea-level. It is composed of grey\r\nquartzose gneiss.\r\n\r\nThere were no signs of recent glaciation or of ice-striae, though the\r\nrock was much weathered, and all the cracks and joint-planes were filled\r\nwith disintegrating material. The weathering was excessive and peculiar\r\nin contrast with that observed on fresh exposures near the Hut and at\r\nother localities near sea-level.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting specimens and placing a small depot of food on the\r\nhighest point, the party continued their way to the Hut, reaching it on\r\nNovember 27.\r\n\r\nAt Winter Quarters noticeable changes had taken place. The harbour ice\r\nhad broken back for several hundred yards and was rotten and ready\r\nto blow out in the first strong wind; marked thawing had occurred\r\neverywhere, and many islands of rock emerged from the snow; the ice-foot\r\nwas diminishing; penguins, seals, and flying birds made the place, for\r\nonce, alive and busy.\r\n\r\nBickerton, Whetter and Hannam carried on the routine of work; Whetter as\r\nmeteorologist and Hannam as magnetician, while Bickerton was busied with\r\nthe air-tractor and in preparations for sledging. Thousands of penguins'\r\neggs had been gathered for the return voyage of the 'Aurora', or in case\r\nof detention for a second winter.\r\n\r\nMurphy, Hunter and Laseron arrived from the south on the same day as\r\nStillwell, Hodgeman and Close came in from the east. The former party\r\nhad plodded for sixty-seven miles through a dense haze of drift. They\r\nhad kept a course roughly by the wind and the direction of sastrugi. The\r\nunvarying white light of thick overcast days had been so severe that all\r\nwere suffering from snow-blindness. When, at length, they passed over\r\nthe endless billows of snow on to the downfalls near the coast, the\r\nweather cleared and they were relieved to see once more the Mecca of all\r\nsledging parties--Aladdin's Cave.\r\n\r\nA redistribution of parties and duties was made. Hodgeman joined Whetter\r\nand Bickerton in preparation for the air-tractor sledge's trip to the\r\nwest. Hunter took up the position of meteorologist and devoted all his\r\nspare time to biological investigations amongst the immigrant life of\r\nsummer. Hannam continued to act as magnetician and general \"handy man.\"\r\nMurphy, who was also to be in charge during the summer, returned to\r\nhis stores, making preparations for departure. Hourly meteorological\r\nobservations kept every one vigilant at the Hut.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of a plan to examine in detail the coast immediately\r\neast of Commonwealth Bay, Stillwell set out with Laseron and Close on\r\nDecember 9. The weather was threatening at the start, and they had the\r\nusual struggle with wind and drift to \"make\" Aladdin's Cave.\r\n\r\nForewarned on the first journey of the dangers of bad ventilation, they\r\ncleared the entrance to the cave of obstacles so that a ready exit could\r\nbe made, if, as was expected, the opening became sealed with snow-drift.\r\nThis did happen during the night, and, though everything seemed all\r\nright the next morning, the whole party was overpowered during breakfast\r\nby foul air, the presence of which was not suspected.\r\n\r\nHoosh was cooked and about to be served, when Stillwell, who was in\r\ncharge of the primus, collapsed. Close immediately seized an ice-axe,\r\nstood up, thrust its point through the choked entrance, and fell down,\r\novercome. Laseron became powerless at the same time. An hour and a half\r\nlater--so it was reckoned--the party revived and cleared the opening.\r\nThe hole made by the ice-axe had been sufficient to save their lives.\r\nFor a day they were too weak and exhausted to travel, so the tent was\r\npitched and the night spent outside the Cave.\r\n\r\nOn December 11 they steered due south for a while and then eastward\r\nfor three days to Madigan Nunatak; delayed for twenty-four hours by a\r\nblizzard.\r\n\r\nStillwell goes on to describe: \"Part of the 15th was spent in making\r\nobservations, taking photographs and collecting specimens of rocks and\r\nlichens. Breaking camp, we set out on a northerly course for the coast\r\ndown gently falling snowfields. Gradually there opened up a beautiful\r\nvista of sea, dotted with floes and rocky islets (many of which were\r\nice-capped). On December 16 camp was pitched near the coast on a stretch\r\nof firm, unbroken ice, which enabled one to venture close enough to the\r\nedge to discover an islet connected by a snow-ramp with the icy barrier.\r\nLying farther off the shore was a thick fringe of islets, among and\r\nbeyond which drifted a large quantity of heavy floe. The separate floes\r\nstood some ten or fifteen feet above the water-level, and the lengths of\r\nseveral exceeded a quarter of a mile. Every accessible rock was covered\r\nwith rookeries of Adelie penguins; the first chicks were just hatched.\"\r\n\r\nA theodolite traverse was run to fix the position of each islet. The\r\ntraverse-line was carried close to the ice-cliff, so that the number of\r\nislets hidden from view was as few as possible. Snow mounds were built\r\nat intervals and the intervening distances measured by the sledge-meter.\r\n\r\nThe party travelled west for seven and a quarter miles round a\r\npromontory--Cape Gray--until the Winter Quarters were sighted across\r\nCommonwealth Bay. They then turned eastward over the higher slopes,\r\nmeeting the coast some three miles to the east of the place where they\r\nhad first encountered it. The surface was for the most part covered with\r\nsnow, while crevasses were frequent and treacherous.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the survey the sledge-meter broke down, and, as the\r\nparty were wholly dependent upon it for laying out base-lines, repairs\r\nhad to be made.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nMap showing the remarkable distribution of islets fringing the coast of\r\nAdelie Land in the vicinity of Cape Gray\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 27th another accessible rocky projection was seen. Over it and\r\nthe many islands in the vicinity hovered flocks of snow petrels and\r\noccasional Antarctic and Wilson petrels. Masses of Adelie penguins and\r\nchicks constituted the main population, and skua gulls with eggs were\r\nalso observed. The rock was of garnet gneiss, traversed by black dykes\r\nof pyroxene granulite.\r\n\r\nA great discovery was made on December 29. On the abrupt, northern face\r\nof some rocks connected to the ice-cap of the mainland by a causeway\r\nof ice a large colony of sea-birds had nested. Cape pigeons, the rare\r\nsilver-grey and snow petrels were all present. Amongst these Laseron\r\nmade a collection of many eggs and birds.\r\n\r\nThe traverse-line was then carried back to Madigan Nunatak along a\r\nseries of connecting mounds. After being held up for three and a half\r\ndays in a blizzard from December 31 to January 4, the party were home\r\nonce more late on January 5, 1913.\r\n\r\nReturning to the fortunes of the air-tractor sledge, which was to start\r\nwest early in December. Bickerton has a short story to tell, inadequate\r\nto the months of work which were expended on that converted aeroplane.\r\nIts career was mostly associated with misfortune, dating from a serious\r\nfall when in flight at Adelaide, through the southern voyage of the\r\n'Aurora', buffeted by destructive seas, to a capacious snow shelter\r\nin Adelie Land--the Hangar--where for the greater part of the year it\r\nremained helpless and drift-bound.\r\n\r\nBickerton takes up the story:\r\n\r\nI had always imagined that the air-tractor sledge would be most\r\nhandicapped by the low temperature; but the wind was far more\r\nformidable. It is obvious that a machine which depends on the\r\nsurrounding air for its medium of traction could not be tested in\r\nthe winds of an Adelie Land winter. One might just as well try\r\nthe capabilities of a small motor-launch in the rapids at Niagara.\r\nConsequently we had to wait until the high summer.\r\n\r\nWith hopes postponed to an indefinite future, another difficulty arose.\r\nAs it was found that the wind would not allow the sea-ice to form,\r\nbreaking up the floe as quickly as it appeared, the only remaining field\r\nfor manoeuvres was over the highlands to the south; under conditions\r\nquite different from those for which it was suited. We knew that for\r\nthe first three miles there was a rise of some one thousand four hundred\r\nfeet, and in places the gradient was one in three and a half. I thought\r\nthe machine would negotiate this, but it was obviously unsafe to make\r\nthe venture without providing against a headlong rush downhill, if, for\r\nany reason, power should fail.\r\n\r\nSuggestions were not lacking, and after much consideration the following\r\ndevice was adopted:\r\n\r\nA hand rock-drill, somewhat over an inch in diameter, was turned up in\r\nthe lathe, cut with one-eighth-inch pitched, square threads and pointed\r\nat the lower end. This actuated through an internal threaded brass bush\r\nheld in an iron standard; the latter being bolted to the after-end of\r\na runner over a hole bushed for the reception of the drill. Two sets of\r\nthese were got ready; one for each runner.\r\n\r\nThe standards were made from spare caps belonging to the wireless masts.\r\nThe timely fracture of one of the vices supplied me with sufficient\r\nready-cut thread of the required pitch for one brake. Cranked handles\r\nwere fitted, and the points, which came in contact with the ice, were\r\nhardened and tempered. When protruded to their fullest extent, the\r\nspikes extended four inches below the runners.\r\n\r\nThe whole contrivance was not very elegant, but impressed one with its\r\nstrength and reliability. To work the handles, two men had to sit one on\r\neach runner. As the latter were narrow and the available framework,\r\nby which to hold on and steady oneself, rather limited, the office of\r\nbrakesman promised to be one with acrobatic possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start the engine it was necessary to have a calm and, preferably,\r\nsunny day; the engine and oil-tank had been painted black to absorb the\r\nsun's heat. On a windy day with sun and an air temperature of 30 degrees\r\nF., it was only with considerable difficulty that the engine could be\r\nturned--chiefly owing to the thickness of the lubricating oil. But on\r\na calm day with the temperature lower -20 degrees F. for example--the\r\nengine would swing well enough to permit starting, after an hour or\r\ntwo of steady sun. If there were no sun even in the absence of\r\nwind, starting would be out of the question, unless the atmospheric\r\ntemperature were high or the engine were warmed with a blow-lamp.\r\n\r\nIt was not till November 15 that the right combination of conditions\r\ncame. That day was calm and sunny, and the engine needed no more\r\nstimulus than it would have received in a \"decent\" climate.\r\n\r\nHannam, Whetter and I were the only inhabitants of the Hut at the\r\ntime. Having ascertained that the oil and air pumps were working\r\nsatisfactorily, we fitted the wheels and air-rudder, and made a number\r\nof satisfactory trials in the vicinity of the Hut.\r\n\r\nThe wheels were soon discarded as useless; reliance being placed on the\r\nlong runners. Then the brakes were tested for the first time by driving\r\nfor a short distance uphill to the south and glissading down the slope\r\nback to the Hut. With a man in charge of each brake, the machine, when\r\nin full career down the slope, was soon brought to a standstill. The\r\nexperiment was repeated from a higher position on the slope, with the\r\nsame result. The machine was then taken above the steepest part of the\r\nslope (one in three and a half) and, on slipping back, was brought to\r\nrest with ease. The surface was hard, polished blue ice. The air-rudder,\r\nby the way, was efficient at speeds exceeding fifteen miles per hour.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th we had a calm morning, so Whetter and I set out for\r\nAladdin's Cave to depot twenty gallons of benzene and six gallons\r\nof oil. The engine was not running well, one cylinder occasionally\r\n\"missing.\" But, in spite of this and a head wind of fifteen miles per\r\nhour, we covered the distance between the one-mile and the two-mile\r\nflags in three minutes. This was on ice, and the gradient was about one\r\nin fifteen. We went no farther that day, and it was lucky that we did\r\nso, for, soon after our return to the Hut, it was blowing more than\r\nsixty miles per hour.\r\n\r\nOn December 2 Hodgeman joined us in a very successful trip to Aladdin's\r\nCave with nine 8-gallon tins of benzene on a sledge; weighing in all\r\nseven hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nAfter having such a good series of results with the machine, the start\r\nof the real journey was fixed for December 3. At 3 P.M. it fell calm,\r\nand we left at 4 P.M., amid an inspiriting demonstration of goodwill\r\nfrom the six other men. Arms were still waving violently as we crept\r\nnoisily over the brow of the hill and the Hut disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nOn the two steepest portions it was necessary to walk, but, these past,\r\nthe machine went well with a load of three men and four hundred pounds,\r\nreaching Aladdin's Cave in an hour by a route free of small crevasses,\r\nwhich I had discovered on the previous day. Here we loaded up with\r\nthree 100-lb. food-bags, twelve gallons of oil (one hundred and thirty\r\npounds), and seven hundred pounds of benzene. Altogether, there was\r\nenough fuel and lubricating oil to run the engine at full speed for\r\ntwenty hours as well as full rations for three men for six weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes spent in disposing the loads, our procession of\r\nmachine, four sledges (in tow) and three men moved off. The going was\r\nslow, too slow--about three miles an hour on ice. This would probably\r\nmean no movement at all on snow which might soon be expected. But\r\nsomething was wrong. The cylinder which had been missing fire a few\r\ndays before, but which had since been cleaned and put in order, was\r\nnow missing fire again, and the speed, proportionately, had dropped too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nI made sure that the oil was circulating, and cleaned the sparking-plug,\r\nbut the trouble was not remedied. A careful examination showed no\r\nsufficient cause, so it was assumed to be internal. To undertake\r\nanything big was out of the question, so we dropped thirty-two gallons\r\nof benzene and a spare propeller. Another mile went by and we came to\r\nsnow, where forty gallons of benzene, twelve gallons of oil and a sledge\r\nwere abandoned. The speed was now six miles an hour and we did two miles\r\nin very bad form. As it was now 11 P.M. and the wind was beginning to\r\nrise, we camped, feeling none too pleased with the first day's results.\r\n\r\nWhile in the sleeping-bag I tried to think out some rapid way of\r\ndiscovering what was wrong with the engine. The only conclusion to which\r\nI could come was that it would be best to proceed to the cave at eleven\r\nand three-quarter miles--Cathedral Grotto--and there remove the faulty\r\ncylinder, if the weather seemed likely to be favourable; if it did not,\r\nto go on independently with our man-hauled sledge.\r\n\r\nOn December 4 the wind was still blowing about twenty miles per hour\r\nwhen we set to work on the machine. I poured some oil straight into the\r\ncrank-case to make sure that there was sufficient, and we also tested\r\nand improved the ignition. At four o'clock the wind dropped, and in an\r\nhour the engine was started. While moving along, the idle cylinder\r\nwas ejecting oil, and this, together with the fact that it had no\r\ncompression, made me hope that broken piston-rings were the source of\r\nthe trouble. It would only take two hours to remove three cylinders,\r\ntake one ring from each of the two sound ones for the faulty one, and\r\nall might yet be well!\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were brought to a sudden close by the engine, without any\r\nwarning, pulling up with such a jerk that the propeller was smashed.\r\nOn moving the latter, something fell into the oil in the crank-case and\r\nfizzled, while the propeller could only be swung through an angle of\r\nabout 30 deg.. We did not wait to examine any further, but fixed up the\r\nman-hauling sledge, which had so far been carried by the air-tractor\r\nsledge, and cached all except absolute necessities.\r\n\r\nWe were sorry to leave the machine, though we had never dared to expect\r\na great deal from it in the face of the unsuitable conditions found\r\nto prevail in Adelie Land. However, the present situation was\r\ndisappointing.\r\n\r\nHaving stuffed up the exhaust-pipes to keep out the drift, we turned our\r\nbacks to the aero-sledge and made for the eleven-and-three-quarter-mile\r\ncave, arriving there at 8 P.M. There was a cheering note from Bage in\r\nthe \"Grotto\", wishing us good luck.\r\n\r\nTo avoid crevasses we steered first of all to the southwest on the\r\nmorning of the 5th, which was clear and bright. After six miles the\r\nsastrugi became hard and compact, so the course was changed to due west.\r\nShortly afterwards, a piece of rock ** which we took to be a meteorite,\r\nwas found on the surface of the snow. It measured approximately five\r\ninches by three inches by three and a half inches and was covered with a\r\nblack scale which in places had blistered; three or four small pieces of\r\nthis scale were lying within three inches of the main piece. Most of\r\nthe surface was rounded, except one face which looked as if it had been\r\nfractured. It was lying on the snow, in a slight depression, about\r\ntwo and a half inches below the mean surface, and there was nothing to\r\nindicate that there had been any violent impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** This has since been examined by Professor E. Skeats and\r\nStillwell, who report it to be an interesting form of meteorite,\r\ncontaining amongst other minerals, plagioclase felspar. This is, we\r\nbelieve, the first occasion on which a meteorite has been found in the\r\nAntarctic regions.--ED.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock that night we had done twelve miles, losing sight of\r\nthe sea at a height of about three thousand feet. All felt pleased and\r\nlooked forward to getting over a ridge ahead, which, from an altitude\r\nof four thousand feet, ran in pencilled outline to the western point of\r\nCommonwealth Bay.\r\n\r\nOn December 6 it was drifting hard, and part of the morning was spent\r\ntheorizing on our prospects in an optimistic vein. This humour gradually\r\nwore off as the thick drift continued, with a fifty-mile wind, for three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAt 5 P.M. on December 8 a move was made. The drift was what our\r\nHut-standard reckoned to be \"moderate,\" but the wind had fallen to\r\nthirty miles an hour and had veered to the east; so the sail was\r\nhoisted. The going was difficult over a soft surface, and after five\r\nhours, by which time the drift had perceptibly thickened, we had done\r\neight miles.\r\n\r\nThe thirst each one of us developed in those earlier days was\r\nprodigious. When filling the cooker with snow it was hard to refrain\r\nfrom packing it \"up to the knocker\" in order to obtain a sufficient\r\nsupply of water.\r\n\r\nThe next day it blew harder and drifted thicker. Above the loud flapping\r\nof the tent and the incessant sizzling of the drift we discussed our\r\nsituation. We were one week \"out\" and had travelled thirty-one miles.\r\nFuture progress depended entirely on the weather--unfortunately. We were\r\nbeginning to learn that though the season was \"meteorologically\" called\r\nsummer, it was hardly recognizable as such.\r\n\r\nDecember 10 was Whetter's birthday. It was heralded by an extra strong\r\nwind and the usual liberal allowance of drift. I was cook, and made some\r\nmodifications in the meal. Hodgeman (who was the previous cook) used to\r\nmake hoosh as thick as a biscuit, so we had some thin stuff for a change\r\n--two mugs each. Then really strong tea; we boiled it for some time to\r\nmake sure of the strength and added some leaves which had already done\r\ngood service.\r\n\r\nSeveral times fault had been found with the way the tent was pitched.\r\nI had not yet tried my hand at being the \"man inside\" during this\r\noperation. One day, while every one was grumbling, I said I would take\r\nthe responsibility at the next camp; the proposal being received with\r\ngrunts of assent. When the job was finished and the poles appeared to\r\nbe spread taut, I found myself alone in what seemed to me a cathedral.\r\nFeeling pleased, I called for the others to come in, and arranged myself\r\nin a corner with an \"I-told-you-so\" expression on my face, ready to\r\nreceive their congratulations. Hodgeman came in first. He is not a large\r\nman, though he somehow gives one the impression that he is, but after\r\nhe had made himself comfortable the place seemed smaller. When half-way\r\nthrough the \"spout,\" coming in, he gave a grunt which I took to be one\r\nof appreciation. Then Whetter came in. He is of a candid disposition:\r\n\"Ho, ho, laddie, what the dickens have you done with the tent?\"\r\n\r\nI tried to explain their mistake. But it was no good. When we were all\r\ninside, I couldn't help seeing that the tent was much smaller than it\r\nhad ever been before, and we had to huddle together most uncomfortably.\r\nAnd there were three days like this.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock one morning Hodgeman woke me with, \"What about getting\r\na move on?\" The wind had dropped to forty miles an hour, and through a\r\ntiny hole in the tent the ground could be seen. Amid a thinning fog of\r\ndrift, the disc of the sun was just visible.\r\n\r\nWe made a start and then plodded on steadily till midnight over a soft\r\nand uncomfortable surface. Shortly after that hour I looked at the\r\nsledge-meter and found that it had ceased working; the sprocket had been\r\nknocked off. Repair was out of the question, as every joint was soldered\r\nup; so without more ado we dropped it. In future we were to estimate our\r\nspeed, having already had some good experience in this way.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Friday December 13 come on the scene than a catastrophe\r\novertook us. The superstitious might have blamed Fate, but on this\r\noccasion there was no room for doubt; the fault was mine. The sail was\r\nup and, while braking the load upwind, I slipped and fell, allowing the\r\nsledge to collide with a large sastruga. The bow struck the solid snow\r\nwith such force that it was smashed.\r\n\r\nNext day a new bow was manufactured from a spare bamboo which had been\r\nbrought as a depot pole. It took some time splitting and bending this\r\ninto position and then lashing it with raw hide. But the finished\r\narticle fully justified the means, and, in spite of severe treatment,\r\nthe makeshift stood for the rest of the journey.\r\n\r\nWhile on the march on December 16, the wind dropped and the drift ceased\r\nfor the first time since December 5; for eleven days it had been heavy\r\nor moderate. Before we got into harness on the same day, a Wilson petrel\r\nflew above us. This little touch of life, together with the bright sun,\r\nlight wind and lack of drift enabled us to start away in better spirits\r\nthan had been our wont.\r\n\r\nThe next four days passed in excellent weather. The surface was mainly\r\nhard and the clusters of large sastrugi could generally be avoided.\r\nPatches of softer \"piecrust\" were met but only lasted for two or three\r\nmiles. Making up for lost time, we did a few miles short of one hundred\r\nin five days.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there was always drift at midday, so that it was\r\nimpossible to get a latitude \"shot\" with a sextant and artificial\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nOn December 19 camp was pitched at 1 A.M. before a glorious view; an\r\nhorizon of sea from west to north-east and white fields of massive\r\nbergs. In the extreme west there was something which very closely\r\nresembled pack-ice.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th the surface was softer and the snow more recent, but the\r\nwind was behind us and for part of the day the track led downhill into a\r\npeculiar saucer-shaped depression which, on our first entry, looked\r\nlike a valley closed at the far end, while when we came to the middle it\r\nresolved itself once more into a saucer.\r\n\r\nCamping here, I managed to get a good time-shot, so that, provided we\r\noccupied this camp on the return journey, I reckoned that I could get\r\nthe watch-rate and fix the approximate longitude of the pack-ice, which\r\nfor two days had been clearly within view.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nAdelie Land: Showing tracks of the Western Sledging Party from the Main\r\nBase.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 21 marked the end of the good weather, for drift and wind came\r\non apace lasting four days, the wind attaining about eighty miles an\r\nhour. Sleeping-bags and tent-cloth were soon in a wretched state, sodden\r\nwith moisture. Christmas Day was not very enjoyable in cramped quarters,\r\nthe tent having encroached on us owing to drift settling around it.\r\nStill, by the evening, it was clear enough to break camp and we made a\r\nspurt of thirteen miles.\r\n\r\nFrom the next camp there was a good view to the northwest, the\r\npack extending beyond the limit of vision. The land trended to the\r\nwest-north-west and we could see it at a distance of fifty miles from\r\nour altitude.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, I thought it right to turn back at this stage.\r\nIn twenty-six days we had done one hundred and fifty-eight miles, and\r\nninety-seven miles of that distance had been covered on the only five\r\nconsecutive good days. We waited some time until the sun appeared, when\r\nI was able to get an observation while Hodgeman made a sketch of the\r\nview.\r\n\r\nBy December 30 we reoccupied the camp of the 20th, sixteen miles on the\r\nreturn journey. A time-shot was successful, and observations were also\r\ntaken for magnetic declination.\r\n\r\nAs the weather was fine, Hodgeman and Whetter went to investigate two\r\nodd-looking pyramids about five miles away. These turned out to be high\r\nsnow-ramps, two hundred yards long, on the lee side of open crevasses.\r\n\r\nThe last day of 1912 was calm and \"snow-blind\"--the first of this\r\nparticular variety we had experienced without drift. A New Year pudding\r\nwas made of soaked biscuit, cocoa, milk, sugar, butter, and a few\r\nremaining raisins, and it was, of course, an immense success.\r\n\r\nOn January 1 and the two succeeding days the drift was so thick that\r\nwe had to lie up and amuse ourselves discussing various matters of\r\nindividual interest. Hodgeman gave us a lecture on architecture,\r\nexplaining the beauties of certain well-known buildings. Whetter\r\nwould describe some delicate surgical operation, while I talked about\r\nmachinery. I also worked up the time-shots, and the hours passed\r\nquickly. If only our sleeping-bags had been drier we might have enjoyed\r\nourselves at intervals.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the 4th found us camped ten miles nearer home, beside a\r\nlarge crevasse and with a closer view of the bay seen on December 20.\r\nThis time we were greatly excited to see rocks outcropping near the\r\nwater-line, and an investigation of them was resolved upon for the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nThe morning broke overcast and ghostly white. Although only ten yards\r\naway from it, we could not see the huge crevasse in our vicinity. Thus\r\nour expedition to the rocks had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nAfter a week's travelling, during which obscured skies and intermittent\r\ndrift were the rule, we were once more in the neighbourhood of Madigan's\r\nspring depot, forty-five miles west of Aladdin's Cave. It had been\r\npassed without our seeing any signs of it on the outward journey, and,\r\nas we never relied on finding it, we did not mind about missing it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThick drift and a fifty-mile wind on January 12 kept us confined for\r\nthirty-six hours. It was clear enough after noon on the 13th, and five\r\nmiles were covered in four hours through thick surface drift. What the\r\ncourse was we did not care as we steered by the sastrugi. If ever a\r\nman had any \"homing instinct\" it would surely show itself on such an\r\noccasion as this.\r\n\r\nTravelling in driving snow used to have a curious effect on me. I always\r\nimagined that we were just coming to an avenue of trees running at right\r\nangles to our course. What produced this idea I have not the slightest\r\nsuspicion, but while it lasted, the impression was very strong.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the drift, which was thickest by day, travelling had for some\r\ntime been conducted at night. On the evening of the 14th, during a clear\r\nspell, a ridge rose up behind, and, in front, a wide bay was visible\r\nwith its far eastern point rising in mirage. This was taken to be\r\nCommonwealth Bay, but the fact could not be verified as the drift came\r\non thickly once more. The day's march was twelve miles by concerted\r\nreckoning.\r\n\r\nNext day we went three miles to the north to see if any recognizable\r\nbergs would come in sight, but were stopped by crevasses. The eastward\r\ncourse was therefore resumed.\r\n\r\nAfter continuing for about a mile Hodgeman told us to stop, flung\r\ndown his harness and dashed back to the sledge, rummaging in the\r\ninstrument-box till he found the glasses. \"Yes, it's the aeroplane,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThis remark took us by surprise as we had not expected it for eight\r\nmiles at least. It was about midnight--the time when mirage was at a\r\nmaximum. Consequently, all agreed that the machine was about twelve\r\nmiles away, and we went on our way rejoicing, steering towards the\r\nCathedral Grotto which was two miles south of the aero-sledge. After\r\nthree miles we camped, and, it being my birthday, the two events were\r\ncelebrated by \"blowing in\" the whisky belonging to the medical outfit.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th the weather was thick, and we marched east for ten miles,\r\npassing a tea-leaf, which it was afterwards found must have come\r\ndownwind from the Grotto. For eight hours nothing could be done in thick\r\ndrift, and then, on breaking camp, we actually came to a flag which\r\nhad been planted by Ninnis in the spring, thirteen miles south-east of\r\nAladdin's Cave. The distance to the air-tractor had been over-estimated,\r\nand the Grotto must have been passed quite close.\r\n\r\nWe made off down the hill, running over the crevasses at a great pace.\r\nAladdin's Cave with its medley of boxes, tins, picks and shovels,\r\ngladdened our eyes at 10 P.M. on the 17th. Conspicuous for its colour\r\nwas an orange, stuck on a pick, which told us at once that the Ship was\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII THE SHIP'S STORY\r\n\r\nby Captain J. K. Davis\r\n\r\n    By sport of bitter weather\r\n      We're warty, strained, and scarred\r\n    From the kentledge on the kelson\r\n      To the slings upon the yard.\r\n                                 KIPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Mawson's plans, as laid before the Royal Geographical Society in\r\n1911, provided for an extensive oceanographical campaign in the immense\r\nstretch of ocean to the southward of Australia. Very little was known\r\nof the sea-floor in this area, there being but a few odd soundings only,\r\nbeyond a moderate distance from the Australian coast. Even the\r\ngreat Challenger expedition had scarcely touched upon it; and so our\r\nExpedition had a splendid field for investigation.\r\n\r\nThe first discovery made in this connexion on board the 'Aurora' was\r\nthe fact that deep-water work is more intricate than books would make it\r\nappear. Although text-books had been carefully studied on the subject,\r\nit was found that most of them passed over the practical side of the\r\nwork in a few words, insufficient to give us much help in carrying out\r\ndifficult operations with the vessel rolling and tumbling about in the\r\nheavy seas of the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nSo it was only after a good deal of hard work and many disappointments\r\nthat the experience was gained which enabled us, during the later stages\r\nof the Expedition, to do useful and successful work.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the operations of the 'Aurora' during the winter\r\nof 1912, I shall briefly refer to the equipment provided for\r\noceanographical work.\r\n\r\nThe Lucas Automatic Sounding Machine was situated on the port side\r\nof the forecastle head. It was suitable for depths up to six thousand\r\nfathoms, being fitted with a grooved wheel so as to be driven by a rope\r\nbelt from a steam-winch or other engine. The wire was wound in by means\r\nof a small horizontal steam-engine which had been specially designed for\r\nthe 'Scotia', of the Scottish Antarctic Expedition (1902) and was kindly\r\nlent to us by Dr. W. S. Bruce.\r\n\r\nThe wire as it is paid out passes over a measuring wheel, the\r\nrevolutions of which record on a dial the number of fathoms out. A\r\nspring brake, which is capable of stopping the reel instantly, is kept\r\nout of action by the tension of the wire, but when the sinker strikes\r\nthe bottom, the loss of tension allows the brake to spring back and stop\r\nthe reel. The depth can then be read off on the dial.\r\n\r\nA hollow iron tube called a driver is attached to a piece of hemp line\r\nspliced into the outer end of the sounding wire. This driver bears\r\none or two weights to the bottom and detaches them on striking it; a\r\nspecimen of the bottom being recovered in the hollow part of the tube\r\nwhich is fitted with valves to prevent water from running through it\r\non the way up. Immediately the driver and weight strike the bottom, the\r\nreel automatically stops paying out wire.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a deep-sea sounding on the 'Aurora', the vessel was stopped,\r\nturned so as to bring the wind on the port-bow and kept as nearly\r\nstationary as possible; the engines being used to balance any drift of\r\nthe vessel due to wind or sea.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of sounding in the Southern Ocean were much increased\r\nby the almost constant, heavy swell. The breaking strain of the wire\r\nbeing only two hundred and forty pounds and the load it had to carry to\r\nthe bottom weighing nearly fifty-six pounds in air, it could easily be\r\nunderstood that the sudden strain imposed by the violent rolling of\r\nthe vessel often resulted in the parting of the wire. We soon learnt to\r\nhandle both vessel and sounding machine in such a way as to entail the\r\nleast possible strain on the wire.\r\n\r\nOf all the operations conducted on board the 'Aurora', deep-sea trawling\r\nwas the one about which we had most to learn. Dr. W. S. Bruce gave me\r\nmost valuable advice on the subject before we left England. Later, this\r\nwas supplemented by a cruise in Australian waters on the 'Endeavour',\r\nof the Commonwealth Fisheries Investigation. Here I was able to observe\r\nvarious trawling operations in progress, subsequently applying the\r\ninformation gained to our own requirements on the 'Aurora'.\r\n\r\nA short description of our trawling arrangements may be useful to those\r\nwho are engaged in this work on board a vessel not specially designed\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nWe were provided with three thousand fathoms of tapered steel wire\r\n(varying from one and three-quarters to one and a half inches in\r\ncircumference and weighing roughly a ton to the thousand fathoms in\r\nair); this was kept on a large iron reel (A) mounted on standards and\r\ncontrolled by a friction-brake. This reel was situated on the starboard\r\nside of the main deck, the wire being wound on to it by means of a\r\nchain-drive from the forward cargo-winch.\r\n\r\nFor heaving in, our steam-windlass was fitted with a specially\r\nconstructed drum (B), which absorbed the crushing strain and then\r\nallowed the slack wire to be wound on the reel (A), which was driven as\r\nnearly as possible at the same speed; the windlass usually heaving at\r\nthe rate of four hundred and fifty fathoms per hour.\r\n\r\nA wooden derrick (D), provided with topping lift and guys, was mounted\r\non the foremast by means of a band and goose-neck. At the outer end of\r\nthe derrick, the dynamometer and a fourteen-inch block were attached.\r\nThe maximum strain which could be supported was ten tons. In paying out,\r\nthe wire was led from the head of the derrick to a snatch-block on the\r\nquarter (E), constructed so as to admit of its disengagement from the\r\nwire when it was necessary to heave in. This block kept the wire clear\r\nof the propeller and allowed us to have the vessel moving slow or fast\r\nas required, while the trawl was being paid out. The positions of the\r\nvarious parts of the trawling gear are shown in the plan on the opposite\r\npage.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nPlan illustrating the arrangements for deep-sea trawling on board the\r\n'Aurora'.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore trawling in deep water the vessel was stopped and a sounding\r\nobtained; then the derrick was hoisted, the wire rove through the\r\nvarious blocks, the trawl shackled on, and the men distributed at their\r\nstations. When all was ready, the engines were put at half-speed (three\r\nknots), a course was given to the helmsman and the trawl lowered into\r\nthe water. When it was flowing nicely just astern, the order, \"Slack\r\naway,\" was given; the wire being paid out evenly by means of the\r\nfriction-brakes. In one thousand five hundred fathoms of water, after\r\nthe two-thousand-fathom mark had passed out, the order was given, \"Hold\r\non and make fast.\" Speed was now reduced to one and a half knots and the\r\nwire watched until it gave a decided indication of the trawl dragging\r\nover the bottom. The strain was now taken by the windlass-barrel,\r\ncontrolled by a screw-brake, backed if necessary by a number of turns\r\nround the forward bitts. A slow drag over the bottom was generally\r\ncontinued for one hour. The engines were then stopped, and the order\r\ncame, \"Stand by to heave away.\" This was quickly followed by \"Knock\r\nout,\" which meant the disengaging of the after-block from the wire and\r\nallowed the vessel to swing round head-on to the wire. \"Vast heaving\"\r\nindicated the appearance of the net at the surface, and, when the\r\nmouth of the net was well above the bulwarks the derrick was topped up\r\nvertically, the lower part of the net dragged inboard and the cod-end\r\nuntied, the catch being thus allowed to empty itself on deck. The\r\ncontents of the haul supplied the biologists with the work of sorting\r\nand bottling for the next twelve hours or more.\r\n\r\nThe form of trawl used on board the 'Aurora' was known as a Monagasque\r\ntrawl, of a type employed by the Prince of Monaco. As will be seen from\r\nthe sketch, it is of simple construction and possesses the advantage of\r\nhaving both sides similar so that it is immaterial which lands on the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe winter cruise in the Sub-Antarctic began on May 18, 1912, after\r\nwe had refitted in Sydney and taken on board all the oceanographic\r\napparatus, during the previous month. Leaving Port Jackson, we proceeded\r\nto Port Kembla, N.S.W., and took in four hundred and eleven tons of\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nThe following was the personnel of the ship's officers on this and the\r\ntwo following cruises: Chief Officer, F. D. Fletcher; Chief Engineer, F.\r\nJ. Gillies; Second Officer, P. Gray; Third Officer, C. P. de la Motte.\r\n\r\nDuring the first dredging cruise, Mr. E. R. Waite, from the Canterbury\r\nMuseum, Christchurch, was in charge of the biological work.\r\n\r\nMy plan was to go through Bass Strait and then to sail towards the\r\nRoyal Company Islands as given on the French chart, before heading for\r\nMacquarie Island. From thence we should steam across to the Auckland\r\nIslands. At both the latter places Mr. Waite would be able to secure\r\nspecimens. It was not expected that the weather would permit of much\r\ntrawling, but we anticipated some good soundings. As a matter of\r\nfact, sub-antarctic weather in the winter may be predicted with some\r\ncertainty: strong winds, heavy seas, much fog and general gloom.\r\n\r\nWe had a fine run through Bass Strait with a light south-east breeze,\r\narriving off King's Island at noon on May 28. The trawling gear was\r\ngot ready for the following day, but the sea was too high and the ship\r\ncontinued south towards the position of the Royal Company Islands.\r\n\r\nOn June 1 we were in latitude 53 degrees south, longitude 152 degrees\r\neast, and had been cruising about fruitlessly in heavy weather for days\r\nwaiting for an opportunity to dredge. After being at sea for a whole\r\nfortnight we had only three soundings to our credit, and it was,\r\ntherefore, resolved to make for Macquarie Island.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th we reached the island and anchored at North-East Bay in\r\ntwelve fathoms, about one mile from land.\r\n\r\nAfter a stiff pull ashore, next day, we landed and found the party all\r\nwell. They had built a comfortable hut and were enjoying life as far as\r\npossible, despite the constant gales and continuous days of fog.\r\n\r\nWe then climbed up the hill to the wireless station, where everything\r\nwas in splendid order. Two small huts had been erected, one for the\r\nengine and the other for the receiving apparatus. Sandell and Sawyer,\r\nthe two operators, were to be congratulated on the efficient way the\r\nstation had been kept going under very considerable difficulty. In\r\naddition to the routine work with Hobart and Wellington they had\r\noccasionally communicated with stations over two thousand miles distant.\r\n\r\nI was able to send the following message to Professor David: \"'Aurora'\r\narrived Macquarie Island; all well, June 7; constant gales and high seas\r\nhave prevented dredging so far. Royal Company Islands not found in the\r\nposition indicated on the chart.\"\r\n\r\nWe were able to land some stores for the use of the land party under\r\nAinsworth. Meteorological, biological and geological work were all in\r\nprogress and the scientific records should be of great value. Up to the\r\ndate of our arrival, no wireless messages had been received from Adelie\r\nLand. As Dr. Mawson was in ignorance of its exact location, the position\r\nof the Western Base under Wild was given to Ainsworth to forward to\r\nAdelie Land in case communication should be established.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Waite had obtained several birds, it was decided to move down\r\nto Lusitania Bay to secure some Royal penguins and a sea-elephant. Two\r\ndays later, the 'Aurora' anchored in the bay, three-quarters of a mile\r\nfrom the beach, in sixteen fathoms; the weather was very misty. Mr.\r\nWaite and Mr. Haines, the taxidermist, were rowed ashore.\r\n\r\nThe island, above a height of three hundred feet from sea-level, was\r\nshrouded in mist throughout the day, and, before dark, all signs of the\r\nland had disappeared. The mist did not clear until 6 P.M. on the 15th.\r\n\r\nWe stayed for a whole fortnight at Macquarie Island, during which time\r\nthe highest velocity of the wind recorded on shore was thirty-five\r\nmiles per hour, although, during the winter, gales are almost of daily\r\noccurrence. On June 22, the date of departure, a course was set for the\r\nAuckland Islands, which lie in the track of homeward-bound vessels from\r\nAustralia via Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nThe group was discovered in 1806 by Captain Bristow of the 'Ocean',\r\nowned by Samuel Enderby. It comprises one main island and several\r\nsmaller ones, separated by narrow channels. There are two spacious\r\nharbours; a northern, now called Port Ross, and a southern, Carnley\r\nHarbour. The islands are situated about one hundred and eighty miles\r\nsouth of Stewart Island (New Zealand).\r\n\r\nAfter a run of three hundred and forty miles on a northeast course, we\r\nentered Carnley Harbour and anchored off Flagstaff Point. A breeze blew\r\nstrong from the west-northwest. Next day, June 25, we stood up to Figure\r\nof Eight Island and found good holding for the anchor in nine and a half\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\nThe eastern entrance to Carnley Harbour is formed by two bluff points,\r\nabout two miles apart; its upper extremity terminating in a lagoon.\r\nThe site of Musgrave's house (\"Epigwaith\") is on the east side of this\r\nlagoon. Here he spent twenty months after the wreck of the 'Grafton'.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nAuckland Island (from the Admiralty Chart) showing the track of the\r\n'Aurora'\r\n\r\n\r\nWe set off in the motor-launch on the 26th to visit Camp Cove, where\r\nwe found the two huts maintained by the New Zealand Government for the\r\nbenefit of castaways. In the larger hut there were potatoes, biscuits,\r\ntinned meats and matches. The smaller hut was empty but on the outside\r\nwere carved many names of shipwrecked mariners. The 'Amakura' had\r\nvisited the depot in November 1911. The various depots established on\r\nthe island by the New Zealand Government are visited every six months.\r\n\r\nWhile in Carnley Harbour we were able to make several hauls with the\r\nsmall dredge.\r\n\r\nAfter passing up the eastern coast of the main island we entered Port\r\nRoss and anchored west of Shoe Island. On June 30 the depot on Erebus\r\nCove was visited, where three white sheds contain the usual necessaries\r\nfor unfortunate castaways. The New Zealand Government steamer,\r\n'Hinemoa', while on a scientific expedition to the Sub-Antarctic in\r\n1907, rescued the sixteen survivors of the barque 'Dundonald',\r\ntwo thousand two hundred and three tons, which had been wrecked on\r\nDisappointment Island. The captain and ten men had been drowned and the\r\nchief officer had died from the effects of exposure and starvation.\r\n\r\nOn July 2 we went to Observation Point, finding there a flat stone\r\ncommemorating the visit of the German Scientific Expedition of 1874.\r\n\r\nThe biologist found various kinds of petrels on Shoe Island, where the\r\nturf was riddled in all directions by their burrows.\r\n\r\nAt Rose Island, close by, there are some fine basaltic columns, eighty\r\nfeet high, weathered out into deep caverns along their base.\r\n\r\nIn Sandy Bay, Enderby Island, there was an extensive depot. Among the\r\nstores I found a Venesta case marked s.y. 'Nimrod', which contained\r\ndried vegetables and evidently formed part of the stores which were sold\r\non the return of the British Antarctic Expedition of 1907.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Auckland Islands for New Zealand, we were fortunate in\r\nhaving fairly good weather. Five soundings were taken, and, on July 9,\r\nthe trawl was put over in three hundred and forty-five fathoms. The\r\nnet unfortunately fouled on a rocky bottom and so we gained nothing but\r\nexperience in the operation.\r\n\r\nThe 'Aurora' arrived at Port Lyttleton on July 11 and we received a very\r\nkind welcome from the people of Christchurch. Mr. J. J. Kinsey, well\r\nknown in connexion with various British Antarctic expeditions, gave us\r\nvaluable assistance during our stay. We were back again in Melbourne on\r\nthe 17th of the month.\r\n\r\nWhile the first oceanographical cruise of the 'Aurora' did not prove\r\nvery fruitful in results, chiefly on account of the stormy weather, it\r\nprovided the necessary training for officers and men in the handling\r\nof the deep-sea gear, and we were able to realize later how much we had\r\nlearnt on our first cruise.\r\n\r\nThe ship, after undergoing a thorough overhaul at the State dockyard at\r\nWilliamstown, Victoria, undertook a second deep-sea cruise.\r\n\r\nLeaving Hobart on November 12, 1912, she laid her course to the\r\nsouthward in order to obtain soundings for a complete section of the\r\nsea-floor, as nearly as possible on the meridian of Hobart. Our time was\r\nlimited to one month, during which a visit to Macquarie Island for the\r\npurpose of landing stores and mail had to be made. Professor T. Flynn\r\nof Hobart University accompanied the vessel in charge of the biological\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAn interesting discovery was made two hundred miles south of Tasmania.\r\nHere it was proved that a rocky ridge rose like a huge mountain from\r\ndepths of more than two thousand fathoms to within five hundred and\r\nforty fathoms of the surface. A great number of soundings were taken\r\nin the vicinity of this rise, subsequently named the Mill Rise, until a\r\nheavy gale drove us far from its situation.\r\n\r\nOn November 21 we were not far from Macquarie Island and, at 7 P.M.,\r\nsounded in one thousand four hundred and fifty fathoms. As the weather\r\nwas remarkably fine for these latitudes we decided to lower the trawl.\r\nBefore dark it was being towed slowly towards the east with one thousand\r\nnine hundred fathoms of wire out.\r\n\r\nWe spent an anxious night hoping that the weather would remain fine long\r\nenough to permit us to get the gear on board again. We had been driving\r\nbefore a light westerly wind, when the trawl caught on the bottom and\r\nstopped the vessel.\r\n\r\nA very heavy strain was imposed on the wire as the vessel rose in the\r\nswell; the dynamometer registering up to seven tons. I decided to wait\r\nfor daylight before attempting to heave in the trawl. At 3 A.M. we cast\r\nthe wire off the after-block and started to heave away; it was two hours\r\nbefore the trawl cleared the bottom and the strain was reduced.\r\n\r\nAt 8 A.M. the trawl was once more on board, the frames being bent and\r\ntwisted and the net badly torn. On sounding, the depth was found to be\r\nonly six hundred and thirty-six fathoms, so that we had evidently put\r\nover the trawl on to the edge of a steep rise and then drifted across\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn view of our position--only thirty miles from Macquarie Island--this\r\naccident might have been expected. But opportunities of trawling had\r\nbeen so few that risks had to be taken when the weather quieted down for\r\na few hours. Our only consolation on this occasion was that we recovered\r\nthe gear.\r\n\r\nThe following evening, at 7.30, the anchor was dropped in North-East\r\nBay, Macquarie Island, and we were immediately boarded by our land party\r\nwho were all well. They had become very clever boatmen during their\r\nstay, using a small dinghy to make coastal journeys.\r\n\r\nOn November 24 we left the anchorage at 9 A.M. and spent the day in its\r\nvicinity. More than one hundred soundings were taken, which Blake, the\r\ngeological surveyor, was to plot on the chart of the island which he had\r\nalmost completed.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the steepness of the submarine mountain of which Macquarie\r\nIsland forms the crest may be gathered from a sounding, taken ten and a\r\nhalf miles east of the island, which gave two thousand seven hundred and\r\nforty-five fathoms and no bottom. In other words, if the sea were to dry\r\nup, there would be a lofty mountain rising from the plain of the ocean's\r\nbed to a height of nearly eighteen thousand feet.\r\n\r\nA great deal of work still required to be done off Macquarie Island,\r\nbut, as the uneven and rocky nature of the bottom prevented dredging, I\r\ndecided to sail on the 25th, continuing the voyage towards the Auckland\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nSeveral people had expressed belief in a submarine ridge connecting\r\nMacquarie Island with the Auckland group. Three soundings which we\r\nobtained on this voyage did not support the suggestion, ranging as they\r\ndid from one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five to two thousand four\r\nhundred and thirty fathoms, eighty-five miles south-west of the Auckland\r\ngroup. We were the more glad to obtain these soundings, as, during the\r\nwinter cruise, in the same waters, the weather had forced us to abandon\r\nthe attempt.\r\n\r\nOn November 28 we took several soundings on the eastern side of\r\nthe Auckland Islands, but did not prolong our stay as we wished to\r\ninvestigate the ridge south of Tasmania--the Mill Rise. The course was\r\ntherefore directed westward with a view to outlining the eastern edge of\r\nthis submarine elevation.\r\n\r\nThe first sounding to indicate that we were once more approaching the\r\nMill Rise was in one thousand and seventy-six fathoms. Continuing\r\nwest we secured the next record in one thousand three hundred fathoms,\r\nlimiting the southern extremity of the ridge which extends northward for\r\nnearly one hundred miles. From this sounding the water shoaled quickly\r\nas we steered north. Thus, on the same day, we were in eight hundred and\r\nthirty-five fathoms at noon, in seven hundred and thirty-five fathoms\r\nat 3.40 P.M. and in seven hundred and ten fathoms at 7.30 P.M. After the\r\nlast sounding we lowered the rock-gripper. On the first trial, however,\r\nit failed to shut and, on the second, only a little fine sand was\r\nrecovered. As it was blowing hard most of the time, we were very\r\nfortunate in being able to do this piece of work.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the chart reveals the fact that the main direction of\r\nthe shallowest water is in a north-west and south-east direction, but\r\nthe number of soundings obtained was too small to give more than a\r\ngeneral outline. Later, we were able to add to these on the voyage\r\nsouthward to relieve the Antarctic Bases.\r\n\r\nThe weather was so bad and the sea so heavy that we were unable to\r\nobtain soundings on December 9, and, as dredging under such conditions\r\nwas out of the question, I decided to steer for the east coast of\r\nTasmania, where dredging might be possible under the lee of the land.\r\nThe constant gales were very disheartening, the last having continued\r\nfor four days with only short intervals of moderate weather.\r\n\r\nOn December 12 and 13, in calmer water, some thirty miles off the east\r\ncoast of Tasmania, trawlings were made successfully in one thousand\r\nthree hundred fathoms and seventy-five fathoms respectively. From the\r\ndeeper trawling were obtained a large octopus and several interesting\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nJust before noon on December 14 we arrived in Hobart and immediately\r\nbegan preparations for the voyage to the Antarctic.\r\n\r\nOn December 24, 1912, preparations for sailing were complete. For ten\r\ndays every one connected with the 'Aurora' had been working at high\r\npressure, and Christmas Day, our last day ashore, was to be celebrated\r\nas a well-earned holiday.\r\n\r\nThere was on board a good supply of coal, five hundred and twenty-one\r\ntons, and a very heavy mail of letters and packages for the members\r\nof the Expedition who had been isolated in the far South for more than\r\ntwelve months. We were to take thirty-five sheep on board as well as\r\ntwenty-one dogs, presented by Captain Amundsen upon his return from his\r\nSouth Polar expedition. Captain James Davis, of Hobart, of long whaling\r\nexperience, was to accompany us to give an expert opinion upon such\r\nwhales as we might meet. Mr. Van Waterschoot van der Gracht, who had had\r\nprevious experience in the Antarctic, joined as marine artist, and Mr.\r\nS. N. Jeffryes as wireless operator. With C. C. Eitel, Secretary of the\r\nExpedition, the whole party on board numbered twenty-eight.\r\n\r\nA very pleasant Christmas was spent ashore. The ship's company of\r\ntwenty-three men met for dinner, and we did not forget to wish a \"Merry\r\nChristmas\" to our leader and his twenty-six comrades who were holding\r\ntheir celebration amid the icy solitudes of Antarctica. I was glad, on\r\nthis festive occasion, to be able to congratulate officers and men on\r\ntheir willing and loyal service during the previous twelve months; every\r\none had done his best to advance the objects of the Expedition.\r\n\r\nThe attractions of Hobart, at this season, are so numerous, and\r\nTasmanian hospitality so boundless, that it gives me great pleasure to\r\nplace on record that every man was at his post on the 'Aurora' at 10\r\nA.M. on Boxing Day.\r\n\r\nAs we drew away from the wharf amid the cheers of those who had come to\r\nwish us God-speed, the weather was perfect and the scene on the Derwent\r\nbright and cheering. Captain James Davis acted as pilot.\r\n\r\nAt 11.30 A.M. we had embarked the twenty-one dogs, which were brought\r\noff from the Quarantine Station, and were steaming down Storm Bay.\r\nOutside there was a heavy swell, and the wind was freshening from the\r\nwest. The course was laid south 50 degrees west, true.\r\n\r\nFor the next two days there was a westerly gale with a very high sea,\r\nand the dogs and sheep had a bad time, as a good deal of water came\r\naboard. Two of the sheep had to be killed. By the afternoon of the 29th\r\nit had moderated, and a sounding was secured.\r\n\r\nThis storm was followed by another from the west-northwest. The 'Aurora'\r\nweathered it splendidly, although one sea came over everything and\r\nflooded the cabins, while part of the rail of the forecastle head was\r\ncarried away on the morning of the 31st. At this time we were in\r\nthe vicinity of the reputed position of the Royal Company Islands.\r\nA sounding was taken with great difficulty, finding two thousand and\r\ntwenty fathoms and a mud bottom.\r\n\r\nJanuary 4, 1918, was a fine day, with a fresh westerly breeze and a\r\nhigh sea. Occasionally there were snow squalls. At night the wireless\r\noperator was able to hear H.M.S. 'Drake' at Hobart, and also the station\r\nat Macquarie Island; the ship having been fitted to receive wireless\r\nsignals before sailing.\r\n\r\nNext day the sun was bright and there was only a moderate westerly\r\nswell. Large bunches of kelp were frequently seen drifting on the\r\nsurface. \"Blue Billys\"** flew in great numbers about the ship. Two\r\nsoundings were obtained in one thousand nine hundred fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** Prion Banksii.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th a heavy swell came from the south-east. During the morning a\r\nsounding realized two thousand two hundred and seventy fathoms and the\r\nsample of mud contained a small, black manganese nodule. At 8 P.M. a\r\nfloating cask was sighted and taken aboard after much difficulty. It\r\nturned out to be a ship's oil cask, empty, giving no clue from whence it\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nThe first ice was observed about 6 P.M. on the 10th. The water was still\r\ndeep--more than two thousand fathoms.\r\n\r\nBy noon on January 11 loose pack came into view, with a strong blink of\r\nheavier pack to the south. The course was changed to south-west. At 7\r\nP.M. the ship was steaming west in clear water, a few bergs being in\r\nsight and a marked ice-blink to the south. Several whales appeared which\r\nCaptain James Davis reported were \"blue whales\" (finners or rorquals).\r\n\r\nAfter we had been steering westward until almost midnight, the course\r\nwas altered to south-west in the hope of encountering the shelf-ice\r\nbarrier (met in 1912) well to the east of the Main Base station. On\r\nthe 12th we sailed over the position of the ice-tongue in 1912 without\r\nseeing a trace of it, coming up with heavy broken floe at 10 A.M.\r\n\r\nFor four hours the 'Aurora' pushed through massive floes and \"bergy\r\nbits,\" issuing into open water with the blink of ice-covered land to the\r\nsouth. At nine o'clock Adelie Land was plainly visible, and a course\r\nwas set for the Main Base. In squally weather we reached the Mackellar\r\nIslets at midnight, and by 2 A.M. on the 13th dropped anchor in\r\nCommonwealth Bay under the ice-cliffs in twenty fathoms.\r\n\r\nAt 6 A.M. Fletcher, the chief officer, reported that a heavy gust of\r\nwind had struck the ship and caused the chain to carry away the lashing\r\nof the heavy relieving-tackle. The chain then ran over the windlass,\r\nand, before anything could be done, the pointer to which the end of\r\nthe chain was attached had been torn from the bolts, and our best\r\nground-tackle was lost overboard. It was an exasperating accident.\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock the port anchor was dropped in ten fathoms, about eight\r\nhundred yards west of the first anchorage, with ninety fathoms of chain.\r\nThe wind shifted suddenly to the north, and the 'Aurora' swung inshore\r\nuntil her stern was within one hundred yards of the cliffs; but the\r\ndepth at this distance proved to be seventeen fathoms. After a few\r\nnortherly puffs, the wind shifted to the south-east and then died away.\r\n\r\nAt 2.30 P.M. the launch was hoisted over and the mail was taken ashore,\r\nwith sundry specimens of Australian fruit as \"refreshment\" for the\r\nshore-party. The boat harbour was reached before any one ashore had seen\r\nthe 'Aurora'. At the landing-place we were greeted most warmly by nine\r\nwild-looking men; some with beards bleached by the weather. They all\r\nlooked healthy and in very fair condition, after the severe winter, as\r\nthey danced about in joyous excitement.\r\n\r\nWe learned that five sledging parties had left the Hut: Bage, Webb and\r\nHurley had returned from the south, Stillwell, Close and Laseron from\r\nthe east, and the others were still out. In Dr. Mawson's instructions,\r\nall parties were to be back at the Hut by January 15, 1913.\r\n\r\nThe launch made some trips to and from the ship with specimens during\r\nthe afternoon. I returned on board and had a look at the cable. The\r\nweather was fine, but changes were apt to occur without much warning.\r\nAt midnight it was blowing a gale from the south-east, and the chain was\r\nholding well. The launch was hoisted up in the davits and communication\r\nwith the shore was suspended until 8 A.M. on January 15.\r\n\r\nThe lull was of two hours' duration, during which Murphy came aboard\r\nand furnished me with some particulars about the sledging parties still\r\naway.\r\n\r\nDr. Mawson, with Ninnis and Mertz, had gone to the south-east. They were\r\nwell provisioned and had taken eighteen dogs for transport purposes.\r\nBickerton, Hodgeman and Whetter had been out forty-three days to the\r\nwest and had food for forty days only. Madigan, McLean and Correll had\r\nbeen away for seventy days in an easterly direction.\r\n\r\nDr. Mawson had left a letter for me with instructions to take charge if\r\nhe failed to return to time, that is not later than January 15, 1913.\r\n\r\nOn January 16 a party was observed from the ship coming in over the\r\nslope. There was much speculation as to its personnel since, at a\r\ndistance, the three figures could not be recognized. The launch took us\r\nashore and we greeted Madigan, McLean and Correll who had returned from\r\na very successful expedition along the eastern coast over sea-ice.\r\n\r\nMadigan and Bage came on board during the forenoon of the 17th and\r\nwe had a long consultation about the position of affairs owing to the\r\nnon-return of two parties. It was decided to re-erect the wireless mast\r\nand stay it well while the ship was waiting, so that, in case of any\r\nparty being left at the Main Base, the wireless station would be in\r\nworking order.**\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** It should be borne in mind that during the summer months (November,\r\nDecember, January and part of February) wireless communication with the\r\noutside world is impossible owing to continuous daylight reducing the\r\neffective range. In summer the range was only a few hundred miles, and\r\nthe effective working distance for all times of the day probably not\r\nabove one hundred miles.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock on the morning of January 18, de la Motte, the officer on\r\nwatch, reported that a party could be seen descending the glacier. This\r\nproved to be Bickerton, Hodgeman and Whetter returning from their trip\r\nalong the west coast. Thus Dr. Mawson's party was the only one which had\r\nnot yet returned.\r\n\r\nAll day work on the wireless mast went along very satisfactorily, while\r\nCaptain James Davis and Chief Officer Fletcher spent their time in the\r\nlaunch dragging for the cable lost on the morning of our arrival.\r\nThe launch returned at 10.30 P.M. and Captain Davis reported that the\r\ngrapnel had been buoyed until operations could be resumed.\r\n\r\nOn January 19 we tried to recover the chain, and to this end the\r\n'Aurora' was taken over to the position where the grapnels had\r\nbeen buoyed and was anchored. All efforts to secure the chain were\r\nunsuccessful. At 7 P.M. we decided to return to our former position,\r\nhaving a hard job to raise the anchor, which appeared to have dragged\r\nunder a big rock. Finally it broke away and came up in a mass of kelp,\r\nand with the stock \"adrift.\" The latter was secured and we steamed back,\r\n\"letting go\" in eleven fathoms with ninety fathoms of chain.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Mawson's party was a week overdue, I considered that the\r\ntime had arrived to issue a provisional notice to the members of the\r\nExpedition at Commonwealth Bay concerning the establishment of a relief\r\nparty to operate from the Main Base.\r\n\r\nA party of four left the Hut on the 20th, keeping a sharp look-out to\r\nthe south-east for any signs of the missing party. They travelled as\r\nfar as the air-tractor sledge which had been abandoned ten miles to the\r\nsouth, bringing it back to the Hut.\r\n\r\nI decided to remain at Commonwealth Bay until January 30. If the\r\nleader's party had not returned by that day, a search party was to\r\nproceed eastward while the 'Aurora' sailed for Wild's Base. From the\r\nreports of the gales which prevailed during the month of March in 1912,\r\nand considering the short daylight there was at that time, I felt that\r\nit would be risking the lives of all on board to return to the Main Base\r\nafter relieving Wild's party. I resolved, therefore, to wait _as long as\r\npossible_. As a result of a consultation with Madigan and Bage, I had a\r\nprovisional notice drafted, to be posted up in the Hut on January 22.\r\n\r\nThis notice was to the effect that the non-arrival of the leader's\r\nparty rendered it necessary to prepare for the establishment of a relief\r\nexpedition at Winter Quarters and appointed Bage, Bickerton, Hodgeman,\r\nJeffryes and McLean as members, under the command of Madigan; to remain\r\nin Antarctica for another year if necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the same evening I went ashore to inspect the wireless mast, which\r\nwas practically complete. The work had been done thoroughly and,\r\nprovided the mast itself did not buckle, the stays were likely to\r\nhold. Hannam, Bickerton and Jeffryes were busy placing the engine and\r\ninstruments in position.\r\n\r\nI then went up the slope for about a mile. The Winter Quarters looked\r\nlike a heap of stones; boundless ice rose up to the southern skyline;\r\nthe dark water to the north was broken by an occasional berg or\r\nthe ice-covered islands. This wonderful region of ice and sea looks\r\nbeautiful on a fine day. But what a terrible, vast solitude, constantly\r\nswept by icy winds and drift, stretches away to the south! A party will\r\ngo out to-morrow to visit the depot at the top of the slope. This is the\r\nseventh day we have been waiting and hoping to welcome the absentees!\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd the breeze was very strong in the forenoon, but the wind\r\nmoderated about 4 P.M., when the launch was able to leave for the shore.\r\nWe could see a search party (Hodgeman, Stillwell, and Correll) marching\r\nagainst a strong south-east wind on their way to examine the depot at\r\nAladdin's Cave and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nThough there was a moderate south-easter blowing, communication with the\r\nland went on during the day. I went ashore early, but the search party\r\ndid not return until noon. They had remained at Aladdin's Cave overnight\r\nand marched farther south next morning, approaching a line of dense\r\ndrift, without seeing anything.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that another party of three men should start next\r\nmorning (January 25) and, going in a southeasterly direction, make a\r\nsearch for five days, laying a depot at their farthest point. Hodgeman,\r\nHurley and McLean made preparations to set out. I left instructions that\r\na flag should be flown on the wireless mast if Dr. Mawson returned.\r\n\r\nI now went through the supplies of provisions and coal which were to\r\nbe landed for the use of the Relief Party. I intended to try and\r\nhave everything on shore by January 29, taking advantage of any short\r\ninterval of fair weather to send a boatload to the landing-place.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th there was a hard south-east gale blowing until the\r\nafternoon, when it moderated sufficiently to send off the launch with\r\nthirteen bags of coal, Gillies being in charge. The boat harbour was\r\nreached in safety, the wind freshening to a gale before 6 P.M.\r\n\r\nTerrific gusts followed in rapid succession and, without warning, the\r\ncable parted sixty fathoms from the anchor at 9 P.M. Having cleared the\r\nreefs to leeward, we managed to get in the rest of the chain and then\r\nstood along the coast to the north-west. By keeping about three miles\r\nfrom the shore, we seemed to be beyond the reach of the more violent\r\ngusts, but a short sea holding the ship broadside to the wind during the\r\nsqualls, rendered it difficult to maintain a fixed course.\r\n\r\nWith reefs and bergs around, the increasing darkness about midnight\r\nmade our position unpleasant. The engines had to be stopped and the ship\r\nallowed to drift with the wind, owing to a bearing becoming hot, but in\r\na quarter of an hour they were moving once more.\r\n\r\nEarly on January 26 the 'Aurora' was about half-way between Winter\r\nQuarters and the western point of Commonwealth Bay, when the wind\r\nsuddenly ceased, and then came away light from the north-west. We could\r\nsee that a south-east gale was still raging close inshore. Over the sea,\r\ntowards the north, dark clouds were scudding with great rapidity along\r\nthe horizon: the scene of a violent disturbance.\r\n\r\nWe returned towards our late anchorage. On reaching it, the south-east\r\nwind had moderated considerably, and we let go our spare anchor and what\r\nhad been saved of the chain.\r\n\r\nTo the north, violent gusts appeared to be travelling in various\r\ndirections, but, to our astonishment, these gusts, after approaching our\r\nposition at a great rate, appeared to curve upwards; the water close to\r\nthe ship was disturbed, and nothing else. This curious phenomenon\r\nlasted for about an hour and then the wind came with a rush from the\r\nsouth-east, testing the anchor-chain in the more furious squalls.\r\n\r\nThe gale was in its third day on the 27th, and there was a \"hurricane\r\nsky\" during the morning. The wind would die away, only to blow more\r\nfiercely than before. The suddenness with which the changes occurred may\r\nbe gathered from the following extracts from my journal:\r\n\r\n\"January 27. 6 A.M. A whole gale blowing from the south-east.\r\n\r\n\"9 A.M. Light airs from north to east. Launch taking coal ashore.\r\n\r\n\"11 A.M. Last cargo of coal had just left ship when the wind freshened\r\nfrom the south-east. The launch had just got inside the boat harbour\r\nwhen a terrific gust struck the vessel and our chain parted. We\r\nwere blown out to sea while heaving in thirty fathoms of chain which\r\nremained.\r\n\r\n\"4 P.M. We have been steaming backwards and forwards until the wind died\r\naway. The launch has just come off and taken another load of stores to\r\nthe boat harbour.\r\n\r\n\"7 P.M. The weather is moderating with rising barometer. Nearly\r\neverything required by the Relief Party is now ashore. Two or three\r\ntrips will take the remainder.\r\n\r\n\"We shall steam about for a few hours, and make the anchorage early\r\nto-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning a kedge-anchor (about five hundred-weights) was lowered\r\nwith the remainder of the chain. For a time this held the ship, but a\r\ngust of wind from the southeast caused it to drag. It was, therefore,\r\nhauled up and, on coming to the surface, was seen to have lost a fluke.\r\n\r\nAll equipment, coal and food were now on shore for the use of the\r\nRelief Party. I had given them everything that could be spared from\r\nthe provisions set apart for the use of the ship's company. Next day\r\nI purposed to cruise along the coast to the east, if the weather were\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nJanuary 29 was fine, so we steamed off at 6.30 A.M. As no flag was seen\r\non the wireless mast, we knew that Dr. Mawson had not returned. A course\r\nwas kept two or three miles from the ice-cliffs beyond the fringe of\r\nrocky islets.\r\n\r\nAt 4 A.M. on the 30th we were alongside the Mertz Glacier and reached\r\nthe head of the bay at the confluence of glacier with land-ice. Mount\r\nMurchison was only dimly visible, but the weather was clear along the\r\nglacier-tongue. Signals were fired and a big kite flown at a height\r\nof about five hundred feet to attract attention on shore in case the\r\nmissing party were near.\r\n\r\n\"1.30 P.M. We are now about half a mile from the head of the inlet. From\r\nthe appearance of the country (heavily crevassed) approach to the sea by\r\na sledging-party would be extremely difficult. There is no floe-ice at\r\nthe foot of the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"10.30 P.M. We are approaching the end of the glacier-tongue around\r\nwhich there is a collection of pack. There is some drift ahead and it\r\nis difficult to see far. We have passed the eastern limit of coast to be\r\nsearched.\r\n\r\n\"10.35 P.M. The glacier-tongue is trending to the east and a line of\r\nheavy pack extends to the north, with many large bergs. No sign of flag\r\nor signal on the end of the barrier.\r\n\r\n\"January 31. We left the glacier-tongue at 8 A.M. and steered back to\r\nWinter Quarters.\r\n\r\n\"At noon we could see Madigan Nunatak, a rocky patch, high up on the\r\nslope.\r\n\r\n\"4.15 P.M. Sighted the large grounded berg, fifteen miles from the Main\r\nBase.\r\n\r\n\"9 P.M. Off Main Base. There is no flag to be seen on the wireless mast!\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Mawson's party is now sixteen days overdue; there must be something\r\nseriously amiss. But from our examination of the line of coast as far as\r\n64 degrees 45' south, 146 degrees 19' east, there does not appear to be\r\nany probability of finding traces along the shore line at the base of\r\nvertical ice-cliffs.\"\r\n\r\nNo communication with the shore was possible until the wind, which\r\nhad again risen, had moderated. We could just stand off and on until a\r\nfavourable opportunity occurred. Once the returning ten members of the\r\nExpedition were embarked it was imperative to hasten towards Wild's\r\nBase.\r\n\r\nA week's gale in Commonwealth Bay! The seven days which followed I\r\ndo not think any of us will forget. From February 1 to 7 it blew a\r\ncontinuous heavy gale, interrupted only when the wind increased to a\r\nfull hurricane ** (eighty miles an hour).\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** * The maximum wind-velocity recorded at this time by the anemometer\r\non shore was approximately eighty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nWe endeavoured to maintain a position under the cliffs where the sea had\r\nnot room to become heavy. This entailed a constant struggle, as, with a\r\nfull head of steam during the squalls, the vessel drove steadily seaward\r\nto where the rising waves broke on board and rendered steering more\r\nperplexing. Then, when it had moderated to a mere \"howl,\" we would crawl\r\nback, only to be driven out again by the next squall. The blinding spray\r\nwhich was swept out in front of the squalls froze solidly on board and\r\nlent additional difficulty to the operation of \"wearing ship.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that we realized what a fine old vessel the\r\n'Aurora' was, and, as we slowly moved back to shelter, could appreciate\r\nhow efficiently our engine-room staff under Gillies were carrying out\r\ntheir duties. The ordinary steaming speed was six knots, yet for the\r\nwhole of this week, without a hitch, the ship was being driven at\r\nan equivalent of ten knots. The fact of having this reserve power\r\nundoubtedly saved us from disaster.\r\n\r\nA typical entry from my diary reads:\r\n\r\n\"February 6. Just as the sun was showing over the ice-slopes this\r\nmorning (4 A.M.) the wind became very violent with the most terrific\r\nsqualls I have ever experienced. Vessel absolutely unmanageable, driving\r\nout to sea. I was expecting the masts to go overboard every minute.\r\nThis was the worst, I think, lasting about two hours. At 6 A.M., still\r\nblowing very hard but squalls less violent, gradually made shelter\r\nduring the morning....\"\r\n\r\nOn February 8 the weather improved after 1 A.M. The gusts were less\r\nviolent and the lulls were of longer duration. At 9 A.M. there was only\r\na gentle breeze. We steamed in towards the boat harbour and signalled\r\nfor the launch to come off with the ten members of the shore-party. The\r\nlatter had been instructed to remain at the Hut until the vessel was\r\nready to sail. Here, while the gale had been in full career, they had\r\nhelped to secure enough seal and penguin-meat to keep the Relief Party\r\nand their dogs for another year.\r\n\r\nThe good-byes were brief while the launch discharged the men and their\r\nbelongings. Instructions were handed over to Madigan directing him to\r\nfollow the course believed to have been taken by Dr. Mawson and to\r\nmake an exhaustive search, commencing as soon as the 'Aurora' left\r\nCommonwealth Bay. Madigan gave me a letter containing a report of the\r\nwork done by the party which had left on the 25th.\r\n\r\nIt appears that they had been confined in Aladdin's Cave for twenty-four\r\nhours by dense drift and then, in moderate drift, made four miles to the\r\nsouth-east. Here they camped and were not able to move for thirty-six\r\nhours in a high wind with thick snow.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th the drift decreased in amount and, though it was only\r\npossible to see a few hundred yards and crevasses were frequent, they\r\nkept a course of east 30 degrees south for six miles. A snow-mound was\r\nbuilt and on top of it were placed provisions and a note giving the\r\nbearing and distance from Aladdin's Cave.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the wind subsided and it became clear. Eight miles on\r\nthe same course brought them to their farthest camp, twenty-three miles\r\nfrom the Hut. A mound of eleven feet was erected here, provisions and a\r\nnote being left and some black bunting wound among the snow-blocks. The\r\ndepot was on a ridge and, with glasses, several miles could be swept to\r\nthe south-east.\r\n\r\nThe party consisted of McLean, Hodgeman and Hurley.\r\n\r\nDe la Motte and Hannam took the Relief Party ashore in the launch and,\r\nas soon as they had returned--at 11.30 A.M.--we steamed out of the bay.\r\nThe weather had calmed and there were light airs and a smooth sea.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Relief Party were as follows: C. T. Madigan (leader),\r\nR. Bage, F. H. Bickerton, A. J. Hodgeman, Dr. A. L. McLean and S. N.\r\nJeffryes (wireless operator). The remaining ten members of the Main Base\r\nParty returned to Australia: J. H. Close, P. E. Correll, W. H.\r\nHannam, J. G. Hunter, J. F. Hurley, C. F. Laseron, H. D. Murphy, F. L.\r\nStillwell, E. N. Webb and Dr. L. A. Whetter.\r\n\r\nThroughout the afternoon we steered north-west and at 8.30 P.M. were\r\napproaching heavy pack. Just then Hannam received a wireless message\r\nfrom the Main Base informing us that Dr. Mawson had reached the Hut\r\nalone, his two comrades having perished, and instructing me to return\r\nat once and pick up all hands. We turned round and steered back\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nAt 8 A.M. on February 9 the ship entered Commonwealth Bay steaming\r\nagainst a strong southerly breeze with some snow. We were right up near\r\nthe anchorage about noon and the Pilot Jack could be seen flying from\r\nthe wireless mast. Instructions were signalled for, but our efforts were\r\nunobserved. We then steamed to and fro across the bay. At 6 P.M. it was\r\nblowing a hard gale and showed signs of becoming worse.\r\n\r\nAt 6 P.M. the wind was growing in strength and the barometer was\r\nfalling. Not having received any reply to my signal for instructions, I\r\nfelt it was necessary to decide whether I was justified in remaining any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nAfter considering the position in all its bearings I decided to sail\r\nwestward without further delay and for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Dr. Mawson and his companions were in safety, comfortably housed and\r\nfully equipped for another winter.\r\n\r\n2. Any further delay was seriously endangering our chance of being able\r\nto relieve Wild's party that year. The navigation of the fifteen hundred\r\nmiles to the Shackleton Ice-Shelf was becoming, daily, more dangerous on\r\naccount of the shortness of daylight and the conditions of the ice.\r\n\r\n3. The only vessel which had wintered in the vicinity of the Western\r\nBase (the 'Gauss') had been frozen in as early in the season as February\r\n22, spending more than twelve months in the ice. The 'Aurora' was not\r\nprovisioned for a winter in the ice.\r\n\r\n4. It had been ascertained from the records at the Main Base that gales\r\nwere often protracted at the close of the short summer season. We had\r\njust experienced one such gale, lasting seven days.\r\n\r\n5. As a seaman, I had realized the difficulties encountered in\r\napproaching and getting away from the Western Base in 1912. It was then\r\nthree weeks later in the year.\r\n\r\nI felt convinced that in leaving the Main Base, without further delay,\r\nI was acting as Dr. Mawson would have wished, if I had been able to\r\nacquaint him with the position of the Western Party.\r\n\r\nAt 6.30 P.M. we steamed out of the bay, the wind moderating as the ship\r\ngot well out to sea. At midnight there was a moderate breeze from the\r\nsouth, with some snow.\r\n\r\nOn February 10 heavy pack was met, about fifty miles north of\r\nCommonwealth Bay. After coasting along its margin for a while, we pushed\r\namong the floes and, after three hours, reached a patch of fairly open\r\nwater about 1 P.M.\r\n\r\nOne hour later a large ice-formation was sighted, which tallied with\r\nthat met on January 3 of the previous year (1912) and which, on this\r\noccasion, was no longer in its original position. We came to the\r\nconclusion that the whole must have drifted about fifty miles to the\r\nnorth-west during the intervening year. The face of this huge berg,\r\nalong which the 'Aurora' coasted, was about forty miles in length.\r\n\r\nHannam heard fragments of a message from Dr. Mawson during the evening.\r\nThe words, \"crevasse,\" \"Ninnis,\" \"Mertz,\" \"broken\" and \"cable\" were\r\npicked up.\r\n\r\nGood progress was made on the 11th against a high westerly sea. The sun\r\nset in a clear sky and the barometer was slowly rising. Our position was\r\nevidently north of the pack and, if unimpeded by ice, there was a chance\r\nof the ship arriving at her destination in time.\r\n\r\nPoor headway was made for nearly three days against an adverse wind and\r\nsea. Then, late on the 14th, a breeze sprang up from the east-south-east\r\nand, under all sail, the 'Aurora' made seven knots.\r\n\r\nNext morning we were driving along before an easterly gale in thick\r\nsnow, and at noon the day's run was one hundred and eighty miles.\r\n\r\nThe journal describes the following week:\r\n\r\n\"February 16. The weather cleared up this morning and the sun came out,\r\nenabling us to fix our position.\r\n\r\n\"We are doing about eight knots under topsails and foresail. The\r\nsky looked threatening this evening but improved considerably before\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\n\"February 17. There were frequent snow squalls today, making it\r\ndifficult to see. Only a few scattered pieces of ice were about.\r\n\r\n\"February 18. Bright, clear weather to-day enabled us to get good\r\nobservations. There are a great many 'blue whales' round the ship, and\r\nthe many bergs in sight are suggestive of heavy pack to the south. A\r\ngreat many petrels and Cape pigeons have been seen.\r\n\r\n\"February 19. The ship was brought up this morning at 8.45 by a line\r\nof heavy pack extending across the course. The weather was misty, but\r\ncleared up before noon. We have been obliged to steer a northerly course\r\nalong the edge of the pack.\r\n\r\n\"The margin of this pack is some sixty miles farther north than that\r\nwhich we followed in 1912.\r\n\r\n\"At midnight we were steering north-north-west; many bergs in sight and\r\na line of pack to port.\r\n\r\n\"February 20. At daylight we were able to steer southwest, being at noon\r\nabout twenty miles north of Termination Ice-Tongue. Pushing through\r\nthe looser edge of pack for a couple of hours we saw the loom of the\r\nice-tongue to the southward. The pack becoming closer, we turned back to\r\nthe north in order to try and push through farther west, where the sky\r\nlooked more promising.\r\n\r\n\"At dark we were in a patch of clear water, with ice all around. It\r\nbegan to snow and, as the wind remained a light easterly, the ship was\r\nallowed to drift until daylight.\r\n\r\n\"February 21. The morning was very foggy up till 11 A.M. We steered west\r\nuntil noon and then entered the pack; there was a promising sky towards\r\nthe south. Fair progress was made through the ice, which became looser\r\nas we advanced to the south. At 8 P.M. we passed through leads by\r\nmoonlight, having a favourable run throughout the night.\r\n\r\n\"February 22. At 4 A.M. the wind freshened from the south-east with some\r\nsnow; the floes were getting heavier and the advent of a blizzard was\r\nnot hailed with joy. About noon the ship approached open water and the\r\nsnow ceased.\r\n\r\n\"We were now on the confines of the sea of bergs where navigation had\r\nproved so dangerous in 1912.\r\n\r\n\"At 8 P.M. the driving snow and growing darkness made it impossible to\r\nsee any distance ahead. The next seven hours were the most anxious I\r\nhave ever spent at sea. Although the wind blew hard from the south-east,\r\nwe passed through the sea of bergs without mishap, guided and protected\r\nby a Higher Power.\r\n\r\n\"February 23. At 4 A.M. the loom of an ice-tongue was sighted and\r\nwe were soon standing in to follow this feature until we reached the\r\nShackleton Shelf.\r\n\r\n\"At 8 A.M. we found that we were some miles south of our reckoning.\r\n\r\n\"At 11 A.M. we sighted a depot-flag on the slope. Soon after the ship\r\nwas up to the fast floe at the head of the bay, the ice being nearly\r\na mile farther north than on the previous year. In fact, the\r\nice-conditions as a whole had changed considerably.\r\n\r\n\"At noon we reached the Base and found the party all well.\"\r\n\r\nWild and his comrades were as glad to see the 'Aurora' as we were to\r\nsee them. They had commenced to lay in a stock of seal-meat fearing that\r\nthey might have to pass another winter on the glacier.\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon every one was busy getting baggage on board and\r\nwatering ship. The weather was good and I had intended to sail on the\r\nsame evening by moonlight, following the glacier-tongue northward in\r\nclear water for sixty miles.\r\n\r\nAs we turned northward, \"all well\" on board, I felt truly thankful that\r\nWild's party had been relieved and anxiety on their account was now at\r\nan end. The party included F. Wild (leader), G. Dovers, C. T. Harrisson,\r\nC. A. Hoadley, Dr. S. E. Jones, A. L. Kennedy, M. H. Moyes and A. D.\r\nWatson.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 24th there was a fresh easterly breeze, while the ship\r\nsteamed among fields of bergs, for the most part of glacier-ice. It is\r\nmarvellous how a vessel can pass through such an accumulation in the\r\ndark and come off with only a few bumps!\r\n\r\nPack consisting of heavy broken floe-ice was entered at four o'clock on\r\nthe same day, and at 8 A.M. on the 25th we were clear of it, steering\r\nonce more among bergs, many of which were earth-stained. The day was\r\nremarkably fine with light winds and a smooth sea.\r\n\r\nAfter we had passed through three hundred miles of berg-strewn ocean,\r\nlarge masses of ice, water-worn in most instances, were still numerous,\r\nand on February 27, though our position was north of the 80th parallel,\r\nthey were just beginning to diminish in numbers. At noon on that day a\r\nsounding was made in two thousand two hundred and thirty fathoms.\r\n\r\nAny hope we may have had of steaming to the east with the object of\r\nattempting to relieve the seven men at Adelie Land had to be definitely\r\nabandoned on account of the small supply of coal which remained.\r\n\r\nThere was now a clear run of two thousand miles through the zone of\r\nwesterly gales and high seas, and on March 14 we reached Port Esperance.\r\nMr. Eitel, Secretary of the Expedition, landed here and caught the\r\nsteamer Dover to Hobart. We heard of the disaster to Captain Scott and\r\nit was learned that wireless messages had been received from Dr. Mawson,\r\nwhich had been forwarded on to Australia through the Macquarie Island\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX THE WESTERN BASE--ESTABLISHMENT AND EARLY ADVENTURES\r\n\r\nby F. Wild\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 7 A.M. on February 21, 1912, the 'Aurora' steamed away to the north\r\nleaving us on the Shackleton Ice-Shelf, while cheers and hearty good\r\nwishes were exchanged with the ship's company. On the sea-ice, that day,\r\nthere stood with me my comrades--the Western Party; G. Dovers, C. T.\r\nHarrisson, C. A. Hoadley, S. E. Jones, A. L. Kennedy, M. H. Moyes and A.\r\nD. Watson.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded to the top of the cliff, where the remainder of the\r\nstores and gear were hauled up. Tents were then erected and the work of\r\nhut-building at once commenced. The site selected for our home was\r\nsix hundred and forty yards inland from the spot where the stores were\r\nlanded, and, as the edge of the glacier was very badly broken, I was\r\nanxious to get a supply of food, clothing and fuel moved back from the\r\nedge to safety as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-eight Greenland dogs that had reached Antarctica in the\r\n'Aurora', nineteen were landed in Adelie Land and nine with us. So far,\r\nnone of these had been broken in for sledging, and all were in poor\r\ncondition. Their quarters on the ship had been very cramped, and many\r\ntimes they had been thoroughly soaked in salt water, besides enduring\r\nseveral blizzards in Antarctic waters.\r\n\r\nHarrisson, Hoadley, Kennedy and Jones \"turned the first sod\" in the\r\nfoundations of the hut, while Dovers, Moyes, Watson and I sledged along\r\nsupplies of timber and stores. Inward from the brink of the precipice,\r\nwhich was one hundred feet in height, the surface was fairly good for\r\nsledges, but, owing to crevasses and pressure-ridges, the course was\r\ndevious and mostly uphill.\r\n\r\nUntil the building was completed, the day's work commenced at 6 A.M.,\r\nand, with only half an hour for a midday meal, continued until 7 P.M.\r\nFortunately, the weather was propitious during the seven days when the\r\ncarpenters and joiners ruled the situation; the temperature ranging from\r\n-12 degrees F. to 25 degrees F., while a moderate blizzard interrupted\r\none day. The chief trouble was that the blizzard deposited six feet of\r\nsnow around the stack of stores and coal at the landing-place, thereby\r\nadding considerably to our labour. As evidence of the force of the wind,\r\nthe floe was broken and driven out past the foot of the \"flying-fox,\"\r\ntearing away the lower anchor and breaking the sheer-legs on the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\nAn average day's work on the stores consisted in bringing thirteen loads\r\nover a total distance of nine and a half miles. First of all, the cases\r\nhad to be dug out of the snow-drifts, and loading and unloading the\r\nsledges was scarcely less arduous.\r\n\r\nOn February 27, while working on the roof, Harrisson made an addition\r\nto our geographical knowledge. Well to the north of the mainland, and\r\nbearing a little north of east, he could trace the outline of land.\r\nSubsequently this was proved to be an island, thirty-two miles distant,\r\nand seventeen miles north of the mainland. It was twenty miles long and\r\nfifteen miles wide, being entirely ice-covered. Later on, it was charted\r\nas Masson Island.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, the hut was fit for habitation, the stove was installed,\r\nand meals were cooked and eaten in moderate comfort. The interior of\r\nthe house was twenty feet square, but its area was reduced by a lobby\r\nentrance, three feet by five feet, a dark-room three feet by six feet\r\nsituated on one side, and my cabin six feet six inches square in one\r\ncorner. The others slept in seven bunks which were ranged at\r\nintervals round the walls. Of the remaining space, a large portion was\r\ncommodiously occupied by the stove and table.\r\n\r\nOn three sides, the roof projected five feet beyond the walls and formed\r\na veranda which was boarded up, making an excellent store-room and\r\nwork-room. This was a splendid idea of Dr. Mawson's, enabling us to\r\nwork during the severest storms when there was no room in the hut, and\r\nincidentally supplying extra insulation and rendering the inside\r\nmuch warmer. The main walls and roof were double and covered with\r\nweather-proof felt. Daylight was admitted through four plate-glass\r\nskylights in the roof.\r\n\r\nA blizzard effectually prevented outdoor work on February 29, and all\r\nhands were employed in the hut, lining the roof and walls and fixing\r\nshelves for cooking and other utensils.\r\n\r\nAn attack was made on the transport of stores next day. As a result of\r\ntwelve hours' work, five and a half tons of coal were dragged up and\r\nstowed under the veranda. It was Hoadley's birthday, and the cook made a\r\nspecial feature of the dinner. With extra dainties like figs, cake and a\r\nbottle of wine, we felt that the occasion was fitly celebrated. On March\r\n2, more stores were amassed round the house; Hoadley, Harrisson and I\r\ndoing odd jobs inside, opening cans, sorting out stores, fitting bunks,\r\nshelves and the acetylene gas plant.\r\n\r\nWhile undoing some packages of small boards, Hoadley found that a space\r\nhad been arranged in the centre of one of the bundles, and a box\r\nof cigars inserted by some of the men originally employed upon the\r\nconstruction of the hut in Melbourne. Enclosed was a letter of hearty\r\ngood wishes.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, Dovers and Kennedy lowered a small sledge down to\r\nthe floe and brought up a seal and three Adelie penguins. These served\r\nfor a while as fresh food for ourselves and the dogs.\r\n\r\nSunday March 3 was the finest day we had up till then experienced, and,\r\nsince the work was now sufficiently advanced to make us comparatively\r\ncomfortable and safe, I determined to make a proper Sunday of it. All\r\nhands were called at 8.30 A.M. instead of 6 A.M. After breakfast a few\r\nnecessary jobs were done and at noon a short service was held. When\r\nlunch was over, the skis were unpacked, and all went for a run to the\r\neast in the direction of Masson Island.\r\n\r\nThe glacier's surface was excellent for travelling, but I soon found\r\nthat it would be dangerous to walk about alone without skis, as there\r\nwere a number of crevasses near the hut, some of considerable size; I\r\nopened one twenty-five feet wide. They were all well bridged and would\r\nsupport a man on skis quite easily.\r\n\r\nA heavy gale, with falling snow and blinding drift, came on early the\r\nnext day and continued for forty-eight hours; our worst blizzard up to\r\nthat time. The temperature, below zero before the storm, rose with the\r\nwind to 30 degrees F. Inside, all were employed preparing for a sledging\r\ntrip I intended to make to the mainland before the winter set in.\r\nWe were greatly handicapped by the want of a sewing machine.** When\r\nunpacked, the one which had been brought was found to be without\r\nshuttles, spools and needles. Large canvas bags, made to contain\r\ntwo weeks' provisions for a sledging unit of three men, were in the\r\nequipment, but the smaller bags of calico for the different articles of\r\nfood had to be sewn by hand. Several hundred of these were required, and\r\naltogether the time consumed in making them was considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** By accident the small sewing machine belonging to Wild's party\r\nwas landed at the Main Base--ED.\r\n\r\nEmerging on the morning of the 6th. after the blizzard had blown itself\r\nout, we found that snow-drifts to a depth of twelve feet had collected\r\naround the hut. For entrance and exit, a shaft had to be dug and a\r\nladder made. The stores, stacked in heaps close by, were completely\r\ncovered, and another blizzard swooping down on the 7th made things still\r\nworse. This \"blow,\" persisting till the morning of the 9th, was very\r\nheavy, the wind frequently attaining velocities judged to reach ninety\r\nmiles per hour, accompanied by drift so thick that it was impossible to\r\ngo outside for anything.\r\n\r\nBeyond the erection of the wireless masts, everything was now ready for\r\nthe sledging journey. On the day when the wind abated, a party set to\r\nwork digging holes for the masts and stay-posts. The former were to\r\nbe fifty-two feet high, four and a half feet being buried in the ice.\r\nUnfortunately, a strong breeze with thick drift sprang up just as\r\nhoisting operations had started, and in a few minutes the holes were\r\nfilled up and the workers had to run for shelter. Meanwhile, four men\r\nhad succeeded in rescuing all the buried stores, some being stowed\r\nalongside the hut, and the remainder stacked up again on a new level.\r\n\r\nOn came another severe blizzard, which continued with only a few\r\nminutes' interval until the evening of the 12th. During the short\r\nlull, Jones, Dovers and Hoadley took a sledge for a load of ice from a\r\npressure-ridge rather less than two hundred yards from the hut.\r\nWhile they were absent, the wind freshened again, and they had great\r\ndifficulty in finding a way to the entrance.\r\n\r\nIt was very disappointing to be delayed in this manner, but there was\r\nconsolation in the fact that we were better off in the hut than on the\r\nglacier, and that there was plenty of work inside. The interior was thus\r\nput in order much earlier than it would otherwise have been.\r\n\r\nIn erecting the hut, it was found that a case of nuts and bolts was\r\nmissing, and many places in the frame had in consequence to be secured\r\nwith nails. For a while I was rather doubtful how the building would\r\nstand a really heavy blow. There was, however, no need for uneasiness,\r\nas the first two blizzards drifted snow to such a depth in our immediate\r\nvicinity that, even with the wind at hurricane force, there was scarcely\r\na tremor in the building.\r\n\r\nThe morning of Wednesday March 13 was calm and overcast. Breakfast was\r\nserved at six o'clock. We then set to work and cleared away the snow\r\nfrom the masts and stay-posts, so that by 8.30 A.M. both masts were in\r\nposition. Before the job was over, a singular sight was witnessed. A\r\nlarge section of the glacier--many thousands of tons--calved off into\r\nthe sea. The tremendous waves raised by the fall of this mass smashed\r\ninto fragments all the floe left in the bay. With the sea-ice went the\r\nsnow-slopes which were the natural roadway down. A perpendicular cliff,\r\nsixty to one hundred feet above the water, was all that remained, and\r\nour opportunities of obtaining seals and penguins in the future were cut\r\noff. Of course, too, the old landing-place no longer existed.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the sledging provisions and gear were brought out, weighed\r\nand packed on the sledges; the total weight being one thousand two\r\nhundred and thirty-three pounds. Dovers, Harrisson, Hoadley, Jones,\r\nMoyes and myself were to constitute the party.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for two men to remain behind at the base to keep the\r\nmeteorological records, to wind chronometers, to feed the dogs and to\r\nbring up the remainder of the stores from the edge of the ice-cliff.\r\nKennedy, the magnetician, had to stay, as two term days** were due in\r\nthe next month. It was essential that we should have a medical man with\r\nus, so Jones was included in the sledging party; the others drawing lots\r\nto decide who should remain with Kennedy. The unlucky one was Watson.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** Days set apart by previous arrangement for magnetic \"quick runs.\"\r\n\r\nTo the south of the Base, seventeen miles distant at the nearest point,\r\nthe mainland was visible, entirely ice-clad, running almost due east and\r\nwest. It appeared to rise rapidly to about three thousand feet, and\r\nthen to ascend more gradually as the great plateau of the Antarctic\r\ncontinent. It was my intention to travel inland beyond the lower\r\nice-falls, which extended in an irregular line of riven bluffs all along\r\nthe coast, and then to lay a depot or depots which might be useful on\r\nthe next season's journeys. Another reason for making the journey was to\r\ngive the party some experience in sledging work. The combined weight of\r\nboth sledges and effects was one thousand two hundred and thirty-three\r\npounds, and the total amount of food carried was four hundred and sixty\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nWhile the sledges were being loaded, ten skua gulls paid us a visit,\r\nand, as roast skua is a very pleasant change of food, Jones shot six of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt 1 P.M. we left the hut, making an east-south-east course to clear a\r\npressure-ridge; altering the course once more to south-east. The coast\r\nin this direction looked accessible, whereas a line running due south\r\nwould have brought us to some unpromising ice-falls by a shorter route.\r\n\r\nThe surface was very good and almost free from crevasses; only one, into\r\nwhich Jones fell to his middle, being seen during the afternoon's march.\r\nNot wishing to do too much the first day, especially after the \"soft\"\r\ndays we had been forced to spend in the hut during the spell of bad\r\nweather, I made two short halts in the afternoon and camped at 5 P.M.,\r\nhaving done seven and half miles.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th we rose at 5 A.M., and at 7 A.M. we were on the march. For\r\nthe two hours after starting, the surface was tolerable and then changed\r\nfor the worse; the remainder of the day's work being principally over\r\na hard crust, which was just too brittle to bear the weight of a man,\r\nletting him through to a soft substratum, six or eight inches deep\r\nin the snow. Only those who have travelled in country like this can\r\nproperly realize how wearisome it is.\r\n\r\nAt 9 A.M. the course was altered to south, as there appeared to be a\r\nfairly good track up the hills. The surface of the glacier rose and\r\nfell in long undulations which became wider and more marked as the land\r\napproached. By the time we camped, they were three-quarters of a mile\r\nfrom crest to crest, with a drop of thirty feet from crest to trough.\r\nDespite the heavy trudging we covered more than thirteen miles.\r\n\r\nI made the marching hours 7 A.M. to 5 P.M., so that there was time to\r\nget the evening meal before darkness set in; soon after 6 P.M.\r\n\r\nThe march commenced about seven o'clock on March 15, the thermometer\r\nregistering -8 degrees F., while a light southerly breeze made it feel\r\nmuch colder. The exercise soon warmed us up and, when the breeze died\r\naway, the remainder of the day was perfectly calm.\r\n\r\nA surface of \"pie-crust\" cut down the mileage in the forenoon. At 11\r\nA.M. we encountered many crevasses, from two to five feet wide, with\r\nclean-cut sides and shaky bridges. Hoadley went down to his head in one,\r\nand we all got our legs in others.\r\n\r\nIt became evident after lunch that the land was nearing rapidly, its\r\nlower slopes obscuring the higher land behind. The crevasses also became\r\nwider, so I lengthened the harness with an alpine rope to allow more\r\nroom and to prevent more than two men from being over a chasm at the\r\nsame time. At 4 P.M. we were confronted with one sixty feet wide.\r\nCrevasses over thirty feet in width usually have very solid bridges\r\nand may be considered safe, but this one had badly broken edges and one\r\nhundred yards on the right the lid had collapsed. So instead of marching\r\nsteadily across, we went over singly on the alpine rope and hauled the\r\nsledges along in their turn, when all had crossed in safety. Immediately\r\nafter passing this obstacle the grade became steeper, and, between three\r\nand five o'clock, we rose two hundred feet, traversing several large\r\npatches of neve.\r\n\r\nThat night the tent stood on a field of snow covering the lower slopes\r\nof the hills. On either hand were magnificent examples of ice-falls, but\r\nahead the way seemed open.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a preliminary stiffness, every one felt well after\r\nthe toil of the first few days.\r\n\r\nIn bright sunlight next morning all went to examine the ice-falls to the\r\neast, which were two miles away. Roping up, we made an ascent half-way\r\nto the top which rose five hundred feet and commanded a grand panorama\r\nof glacier and coast. Soon the wind freshened and drift began to fly.\r\nWhen we regained the tents a gale was blowing, with heavy drift, so\r\nthere was nothing to do but make ourselves as comfortable as possible\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nAll through Saturday night the gale raged and up till 11.30 A.M. on\r\nSunday March 16. On turning out, we found that the tents and sledges\r\nwere covered deeply in snow, and we dug continuously for more than two\r\nhours before we were able to pack up and get away. Both sledges ran\r\neasily for nearly a mile over neve, when the gradient increased to\r\none in ten, forcing us to relay. It was found necessary to change our\r\nfinnesko for spiked boots. Relaying regularly, we gradually mounted\r\nsix hundred feet over neve and massive sastrugi. With a steep slope\r\nin front, a halt was made for the night. The sunset was a picture\r\nof prismatic colours reflected over the undulating ice-sheet and the\r\ntumbling cascades of the glacier.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of March 18 the altitude of our camp was one thousand\r\nfour hundred and ten feet, and the slope was covered with sastrugi\r\nridges, three to four feet in height. Travelling over these on the\r\nfollowing day we had frequent capsizes.\r\n\r\nThe outlook to the south was a series of irregular terraces, varying\r\nfrom half a mile to two miles in breadth and twenty to two hundred feet\r\nin height. These were furrowed by small valleys and traversed by ridges,\r\nbut there was not a sign of rock anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe temperature varied from 4 degrees to 14 degrees F. during the day,\r\nand the minimum recorded at night was -11 degrees F.\r\n\r\nAnother nine miles of slow ascent brought us to two thousand feet,\r\nfollowed by a rise of two hundred and twenty feet in seven and\r\nthree-quarter miles on March 21. Hauling over high broken sastrugi\r\nwas laborious enough to make every one glad when the day was over. The\r\nrations were found sufficient, but the plasmon biscuits were so hard\r\nthat they had to be broken with a geological hammer.\r\n\r\nThere now swept down on us a blizzard** which lasted for a whole week,\r\non the evening of March 21. According to my diary, the record is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Friday, March 22. Snowing heavily all day, easterly wind: impossible\r\nto travel as nothing can be seen more than ten to twelve yards away.\r\nTemperature high, 7 degrees to 18 degrees F.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** It is a singular fact that this blizzard occurred on the same date\r\nas that during which Captain Scott and his party lost their lives.\r\n\r\n\"Saturday, March 23. Blowing hard at turn-out time, so did not breakfast\r\nuntil 8.30. Dovers is cook in my tent this week. He got his clothes\r\nfilled up with snow while bringing in the cooker, food-bag, etc. The\r\nwind increased to a fierce gale during the day, and all the loose snow\r\nwhich fell yesterday was shifted.\r\n\r\n\"About 5 P.M. the snow was partially blown away from the skirt or ground\r\ncloth, and the tent bulged in a good deal. I got into burberries and\r\nwent out to secure it; it was useless to shovel on snow as it was blown\r\noff immediately. I therefore dragged the food-bags off the sledge and\r\ndumped them on. The wind and drift were so strong that I had several\r\ntimes to get in the lee of the tent to recover my breath and to clear\r\nthe mask of snow from my face.\r\n\r\n\"We are now rather crowded through the tent bulging in so much, and\r\nhaving cooker and food-bag inside.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, March 24. Had a very bad night. The wind was chopping about\r\nfrom south-east to north and blowing a hurricane. One side of the tent\r\nwas pressed in past the centre, and I had to turn out and support it\r\nwith bag lashings. Then the ventilator was blown in and we had a pile of\r\nsnow two feet high over the sleeping-bags; this kept us warm, but it was\r\nimpossible to prevent some of it getting into the bags, and now we are\r\nvery wet and the bags like sponges. There were quite two hundredweights\r\nof snow on us; all of which came through a hole three inches wide.\r\n\r\n\"According to report from the other tent they are worse off than we are;\r\nthey say they have four feet of snow in the tent. All this is due to the\r\nchange of wind, making the ventilator to windward instead of leeward.\r\n\r\n\"March 25, 26 and 27. Blizzard still continues, less wind but more\r\nsnowfall.\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, March 28. Heavy falling snow and drift, south-east wind. At\r\nnoon, the wind eased down and snow ceased falling, so we slipped into\r\nour burberry over-suits and climbed out to dig for the sledges.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could be seen except about two feet of the tops of the tents,\r\nwhich meant that there was a deposit of five feet of freshly fallen\r\nsnow. The upper two feet was soft and powdery, offering no resistance;\r\nunder that it was still soft, so that we sank to our thighs every step\r\nand frequently to the waist. By 4.30 P.M. both sledges were rescued,\r\nand it was ascertained that no gear had been lost. We all found that the\r\nweek of idleness and confinement had weakened us, and at first were only\r\nable to take short spells at the digging. The sky and barometer promise\r\nfine weather to-morrow, but what awful work it will be pulling!\"\r\n\r\nAt 5.30 A.M. on March 29 the weather was bright and calm. As a strong\r\nwind had blown throughout the night, a harder surface was expected.\r\nOutside, we were surprised to find a fresh wind and thick, low drift;\r\nowing to the tents being snowed up so high, the threshing of the drift\r\nwas not audible. To my disgust the surface was as soft as ever. It\r\nappeared that the only resort was to leave the provisions for the depot\r\non the nearest ridge and return to the Base. The temperature was -20\r\ndegrees F., and, while digging out the tents, Dovers had his nose\r\nfrost-bitten.\r\n\r\nIt took six of us well over an hour to drag the necessary food half a\r\nmile up a rise of less than one hundred feet; the load, sledge included,\r\nnot being five hundred pounds. Nearly all the time we were sinking\r\nthigh-deep, and the sledge itself was going down so far that the\r\ninstrument-box was pushing a mass of snow in front of it. Arriving on\r\nthe ridge, Moyes found that his foot was frozen and he had to go back to\r\ncamp, as there was too much wind to bring it round in the open.\r\n\r\nSufficient food and oil were left at this depot for three men for six\r\nweeks; also a minimum thermometer.\r\n\r\nIn a fresh breeze and flying drift we were off at 10 A.M. next day. At\r\nfirst we were ambitious and moved away with two sledges, sinking from\r\ntwo to three feet all the time. Forty yards was as much as we could do\r\nwithout a rest, and by lunch time nine hundred yards was the total.\r\nNow the course was downhill, and the two sledges were pulled together,\r\ncreeping along with painful slowness, as walking was the hardest\r\nwork imaginable. After one of the most strenuous days I have ever\r\nexperienced, we camped; the sledge-meter recorded one mile four hundred\r\nand fifty yards.\r\n\r\nA spell of two days' blizzard cooped us up once more, but improved\r\nthe surface slightly. Still, it was dreadfully soft, and, but for the\r\nfalling gradient, we would not have made what we did; five miles six\r\nhundred and ten yards, on April 2. On that and the following day it was\r\nfortunate that the road chosen was free of crevasses.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the hills I had decided to reduce the rations but, as the\r\ntrack had grown firm once more, and we were only twenty-five miles from\r\nthe hut, with a week's food, I thought it would be safe to use the full\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving the hills (April 4), a direct course to the hut was\r\nmade. There was no mark by which to steer, except a \"water-sky\" to the\r\nnorth, the hinterland being clouded over. During the afternoon, the sun\r\noccasionally gleamed through a tract of cirro-stratus cloud and there\r\nwas a very fine parhelion: signs of an approaching blizzard. At 4.30\r\nP.M. we had done seventeen and a half miles, and, as all hands were\r\nfresh and willing, I decided to have a meal and go on again, considering\r\nthat the moon was full and there were only six miles to be done.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the march was continued till 8.30 P.M., by which time we\r\nwere due for a rest. I had begun to think that we had passed the hut.\r\n\r\nApril 5 was far from being a Good Friday for us. At 2 A.M. a fresh\r\nbreeze rose and rapidly increased to a heavy gale. At 10 A.M. Hoadley\r\nand I had to go out to secure the tent; the weather-side bulged in more\r\nthan half the width of the tent and was held by a solid load of drift,\r\nbut the other sides were flapping so much that almost all the snow had\r\nbeen shaken off the skirt. Though only five yards away from it we could\r\nnot see the other tent. At noon Hoadley again went out to attend to the\r\ntent and entirely lost himself within six feet of it. He immediately\r\nstarted to yell and I guessed what was the matter at once. Dovers and I\r\nshouted our best, and Hoadley groped his way in with a mask of snow over\r\nhis face. He told us that the wind which was then blowing a good eighty\r\nmiles an hour, knocked him down immediately he was outside, and, when\r\nhe struggled to his feet again, he could see nothing and had no idea in\r\nwhat direction lay the tent.\r\n\r\nThe space inside was now so limited by the combined pressure of wind and\r\nsnow that we did not light the primus, eating lumps of frozen pemmican\r\nfor the evening meal.\r\n\r\nThe blizzard continued with unabated violence until eleven o'clock next\r\nmorning, when it moderated within an hour to half a gale. We turned out\r\nand had a good hot meal. Then we looked to see how the others had fared\r\nand found that their tent had collapsed. Getting at once into wind-proof\r\nclothing, we rushed out and were horrified to see Harrisson in his bag\r\non the snow. He quickly assured us that he was all right. After carrying\r\nhim, bag and all, into our tent, he emerged quite undamaged, but very\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\nJones and Moyes now had to be rescued; they were in a most uncomfortable\r\nposition under the fallen tent. It appears that the tent had blown down\r\non the previous morning at ten o'clock, and for thirty-six hours they\r\nhad had nothing to eat. We did not take long to dig them out.\r\n\r\nThe wind dropped to a moderate breeze, and, through the falling snow,\r\nI could make out a \"water-sky\" to the west. The three unfortunates said\r\nthat they felt fit to travel, so we got under way. The surface was soft\r\nand the pulling very heavy, and I soon saw that the strain was largely\r\ndue to the weakness of the three who had been without food. Calling a\r\nhalt, I asked Jones if it would do to go on; he assured me that they\r\ncould manage to go on with an effort, and the march was resumed.\r\n\r\nNot long after, Dovers sighted the wireless mast, and a quarter of an\r\nhour later we were safely in the hut, much to the surprise of Kennedy\r\nand Watson, who did not expect us to be travelling in such weather, and\r\ngreatly to our own relief. According to the sledge-meter, the last camp\r\nhad only been two miles one hundred yards from home, and if anything had\r\nbeen visible on the night of April 4, we could have got in easily.\r\n\r\nI was very pleased with the way all the party had shaped. They had\r\nworked splendidly and were always cheerful, although conditions had been\r\nexceptionally trying during this journey. No one was any the worse for\r\nthe hardships, except for a few blistered fingers from frost-bites. The\r\nparty lost weight at the average of two and a half pounds; Harrisson\r\nwas the greatest loser, being reduced six pounds. Out of the twenty-five\r\ndays we were away, it was only possible to sledge on twelve days. The\r\ntotal distance covered, including relay work, was nearly one hundred\r\nand twenty-two miles, and the greatest elevation reached on the southern\r\nmainland was two thousand six hundred feet above sea-level.\r\n\r\nKennedy and Watson had been very busy during our absence. In a few days\r\nthey had trained five of the dogs to pull in harness, and transported\r\nthe remainder of the stores from the landing-place, arranging them in\r\npiles round the hut. The weather at the Base had been quite as bad as\r\nthat experienced by us on the land slopes.\r\n\r\nIn the first blizzard both wireless masts were broken down. Watson and\r\nKennedy managed to repair and re-erect one of the masts, but it was only\r\nthirty-seven feet in height. Any final hopes of hearing wireless signals\r\nwere dispelled by the discovery that the case containing the detector\r\nand several other parts necessary for a receiving-station were missing.\r\n\r\nWatson had fitted up a splendid dark-room, as well as plenty of shelves\r\nand racks for cooking utensils.\r\n\r\nKennedy was able to secure a series of observations on one of his term\r\ndays, but, before the next one, the tent he was using was blown to\r\nribbons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX THE WESTERN BASE--WINTER AND SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday, April 7, 1912, a furious blizzard kept us close\r\nprisoners. To meet the occasion, Dovers prepared a special dinner, the\r\nprincipal item being roast mutton, from one of the six carcases landed\r\nwith the stores. Divine service was held in the forenoon.\r\n\r\nThe blizzard raged with such force all Sunday and Monday that I dared\r\nnot let any one go out to feed the dogs, although we found, later, that\r\na fast of three days did not hurt them at all.\r\n\r\nI now thought it time to establish a winter routine. Each member had his\r\nparticular duties to perform, in addition to general work, in which\r\nall hands were engaged. Harrisson took charge of the lamps and checked\r\nconsumption of oil. Hoadley had the care of the provisions, making out\r\nlists showing the amount the cook might use of each article of food,\r\nbesides opening cases and stowing a good assortment on convenient\r\nshelves in the veranda. Jones and Kennedy worked the acetylene plant. In\r\nconnexion with this, I should mention that several parts were missing,\r\nincluding T-pieces for joints and connexions for burners. However\r\nJones, in addition to his ability as a surgeon, showed himself to be an\r\nexcellent plumber, brazier and tinsmith, and the Hut was well lighted\r\nall the time we occupied it. Moyes's duties as meteorologist took him\r\nout at all hours. Watson looked after the dogs, while Dovers relieved\r\nother members when they were cooks. The duty of cook was taken for a\r\nweek at a time by every one except myself. A night watch was kept\r\nby each in turn. The watchman went on duty at 9 P.M., usually taking\r\nadvantage of this night to have a bath and wash his clothes. He prepared\r\nbreakfast, calling all hands at 8.30 A.M. for this meal at nine o'clock.\r\nThe cook for the week was exempt from all other work. In the case of\r\nKennedy, whose magnetic work was done principally at night, arrangements\r\nwere made to assist him with the cooking.\r\n\r\nWork commenced during the winter months at ten o'clock and, unless\r\nanything special had to be done, finished at 1 P.M., when lunch was\r\nserved. The afternoon was usually devoted to sport and recreation.\r\n\r\nThe frequent blizzards and heavy snowfall had by this time buried the\r\nHut so deeply that only the top of the pointed roof was visible and all\r\nthe outside stores were covered.\r\n\r\nMy diary for April 9 says:\r\n\r\n\"The blizzard\" (which had commenced on the evening of the 6th) \"played\r\nitself out during the night and we got to work immediately after\r\nbreakfast. There was still a fresh breeze and low drift, but this\r\ngradually died away.\r\n\r\n\"We were an hour digging an exit from the Hut. The day has been occupied\r\nin cutting a tunnel entrance, forty feet long, through the drift, so\r\nthat driving snow cannot penetrate, and we shall be able to get out with\r\nless trouble.\r\n\r\n\"As we get time I intend to excavate caverns in the huge drifts packed\r\nround the house and stow all our stores inside; also a good supply of\r\nice for use during blizzards.\r\n\r\n\"I had intended to make a trip to Masson Island before the winter\r\nproperly set in, but with the weather behaving as it does, I don't think\r\nit would be wise.\"\r\n\r\nThe 10th, 11th and 12th being fine, good progress was made in digging\r\nout store-rooms on either side of the tunnel, but a blizzard on the 13th\r\nand 14th stopped us again.\r\n\r\nOn going to feed the dogs during the afternoon of the 14th, Watson found\r\nthat Nansen was dead; this left us with seven, as Crippen had already\r\ndied. Of the remainder, only four were of any value; Sweep and the two\r\nbitches, Tiger and Tich, refusing to do anything in harness, and, as\r\nthere was less than sufficient food for them, the two latter had to be\r\nshot. Sweep would have shared the same fate but he disappeared, probably\r\nfalling down a crevasse or over the edge of the glacier.\r\n\r\nUntil the end of April almost all our time was spent in making\r\nstore-rooms and in searching for buried stores; sometimes a shaft would\r\nhave to be sunk eight to twelve feet. Bamboo poles stuck in the snow\r\nmarked the positions of the different stacks. The one marking the\r\ncarbide was blown away, and it was two days before Dovers finally\r\nunearthed it. By the 30th, caves roomy enough to contain everything\r\nwere completed, all being connected by the tunnel. We were now\r\nself-contained, and everything was accessible and immune from the\r\nperiodic blizzards.\r\n\r\nThe entrance, by the way, was a trap-door built over the tunnel and\r\nraised well above the outside surface to prevent it being drifted over.\r\nFrom below it was approached by a ladder, but the end of the tunnel was\r\nleft open, so that in fine weather we could run sledges in and out with\r\nloads of ice. With each blizzard the entrance was completely choked, and\r\nit gave two men a day's work to clear it out once more.\r\n\r\nOn April 16 Kennedy had a term day. A fresh breeze was blowing and the\r\ntemperature was -20 degrees F. Some of his observations had to be taken\r\nin the open and the remainder in a tent. The series took three hours to\r\ncomplete and by that time he was thoroughly chilled through, his feet\r\nand fingers were frost-bitten and his language had grown more incisive\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\nBetween the 10th and the 19th we made a search for penguins and\r\nseals. Hoadley and Moyes staying behind, the rest of us with tents and\r\nequipment journeyed along the edge of the glacier to the south, without\r\nseeing the smallest sign of life. The edge of the shelf-ice was very\r\nmuch fissured, many of the breaches giving no sign of their presence, in\r\nconsequence of which several falls were sustained. It should be remarked\r\nthat the Shackleton Shelf-Ice runs mainly in a southerly direction from\r\nthe Winter Quarters, joining the mainland at a point, afterwards named\r\nJunction Corner. The map of Queen Mary Land illustrates this at a\r\nglance.\r\n\r\nFrom the 25th to the 29th, Kennedy, Harrisson and Jones were employed\r\nbuilding an igloo to be used as a magnetic observatory. On the afternoon\r\nof the 30th, the magnetician invited every one to a tea-party in the\r\nigloo to celebrate the opening. He had the place very nicely decorated\r\nwith flags, and after the reception and the formal inspection of\r\nthe instruments, we were served with quite a good tea. The outside\r\ntemperature was -33 degrees F. and it was not much higher inside the\r\nigloo. As a result, no one extended his visit beyond the bounds of\r\npoliteness.\r\n\r\nOn May 1, Harrisson, Hoadley and Watson went away south towards the\r\nland at the head of the bay, which curved round to Junction Corner, to\r\nexamine icebergs, take photographs and to search for seals. They took\r\nthe four dogs with them and, as the load was a light one--three hundred\r\nand forty-two pounds--the dogs pulled it easily.\r\n\r\nI went with the others to the north, hoping that we might find a portion\r\nof the glacier low enough to give access to the sea-ice. There were\r\nseveral spots where the ice-cliffs were not more than forty to fifty\r\nfeet high, but no convenient ramps led down from the cliffs. In any case\r\nneither penguins nor seals were to be had in the vicinity. A great, flat\r\nsheet of frozen sea stretched away to the north for quite thirty miles.\r\n\r\nMay 2 was fine, but the 3rd and 4th were windy once more and we had to\r\nremain indoors. Saturday, the 4th, was clean-up day, when the verandas,\r\ntunnel and cave were swept and tidied, the stove cleaned, the hut and\r\ndarkroom scrubbed and the windows cleared. The last was a job which was\r\ngenerally detested. During the week, the windows in the roof collected\r\na coat of ice, from an inch to three inches thick, by condensation of\r\nmoisture. Chipping this off was a most tedious piece of work, while in\r\nthe process one's clothes became filled with ice.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday, Harrisson, Hoadley and Watson returned from their short\r\ntrip; they had missed the strong winds which had been blowing at the\r\nBase, although less than twenty miles away. Some very fine old icebergs\r\nwere discovered which were of interest to the two geologists and made\r\ngood subjects for Harrisson's sketches. Watson had had a nasty fall\r\nwhile crossing a patch of rough ice, his nose being rather badly cut in\r\nthe accident.\r\n\r\nOn May 7 another blizzard stopped all outside work. Moyes ventured as\r\nfar as the meteorological screen at noon and got lost, but luckily only\r\nfor a short time. The barometer behaved very strangely during the blow,\r\nrising abruptly during a little more than an hour, and then slowly\r\nfalling once more. For a few hours on the 8th there was a lull and the\r\nstore of ice was replenished, but the 9th and 10th were again spent\r\nindoors, repairing and refitting tents, poles and other sledging gear\r\nduring the working hours, and reading or playing chess and bridge in\r\nthe leisure time. Harrisson carved an excellent set of chessmen,\r\ndistinguishing the \"black\" ones by a stain of permanganate of potash.\r\n\r\nBridge was the favourite game all through the winter, and a continuous\r\nrecord of the scores was kept. Two medals were struck: a neat little\r\nthing for the highest scorer and a huge affair as large as a plate,\r\nslung on a piece of three-and-a-half-inch rope, with \"Jonah\" inscribed\r\non it, to be worn by the player at the foot of the list.\r\n\r\nDivine service was held every Sunday, Moyes and I taking it in turn.\r\nThere was only one hymn book amongst the party, which made it necessary\r\nto write out copies of the hymns each week.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping-bags used on the first sledging journey had been hung up\r\nnear the roof. They were now taken down to be thoroughly overhauled. As\r\na consequence of their severe soaking, they had shrunk considerably and\r\nrequired enlarging. Dovers's bag, besides contracting a good deal, had\r\nlost much hair and was cut up to patch the others. He received a spare\r\none to replace it.\r\n\r\nMay 15 was a beautiful bright morning and I went over to an icy cape two\r\nmiles southward, with Harrisson, Hoadley, Dovers and Watson, to find\r\na road down to the sea-ice. Here, we had good fortune at last, for,\r\nby following down a crevasse which opened out at sea-level into a\r\nmagnificent cave, we walked straight out on to the level plain. Along\r\nthe edge of the glacier there was not even a seal's blow-hole. Watson\r\ntook some photos of the cave and cliff.\r\n\r\nIt was Kennedy's term night; the work keeping him in the igloo from 10\r\nP.M. until 2.30 A.M. He had had some difficulty in finding a means\r\nof warming the observatory--an urgent necessity, since he found it\r\nimpossible to manipulate delicate magnetic instruments for three or four\r\nhours with the temperature from -25 degrees F. to -30 degrees F. The\r\ntrouble was to make a non-magnetic lamp and the problem was finally\r\nsolved by using one of the aluminium cooking pots; converting it into\r\na blubber stove. The stove smoked a great deal and the white walls were\r\nsoon besmirched with a layer of soot.\r\n\r\nThe 17th, 18th and 19th were all calm but dull. One day I laid out a\r\nten-hole golf course and with some homemade balls and hockey sticks for\r\nclubs played a game, not devoid of interest and excitement.\r\n\r\nDuring a blizzard which descended on the evening of the 20th, Zip and\r\nSweep disappeared and on the 21st, a search on the glacier having been\r\nin vain, Dovers and Hoadley made their way down to the floe. They found\r\nZip well and hearty in spite of having had a drop of at least forty feet\r\noff the glacier. A further search for Sweep proved fruitless. We\r\nwere forced to conclude that he was either killed by falling over the\r\nprecipice or he had gone far away hunting for penguins.\r\n\r\nThe regular blizzard immured us on May 22, 23 and 24; the wind at\r\ntimes of terrific force, approaching one hundred miles per hour. It was\r\nimpossible to secure meteorological observations or to feed the dogs\r\nuntil noon on the 24th. Moyes and I went out during a slight cessation\r\nand, with the aid of a rope from the trap-door, managed to find the\r\ndogs, and gave them some biscuits. The drift was then so thick that six\r\nfeet was as far as one could see.\r\n\r\nWe did not forget Empire Day and duly \"spliced the mainbrace.\" The most\r\nbigoted teetotaller could not call us an intemperate party. On each\r\nSaturday night, one drink per man was served out, the popular toast\r\nbeing \"Sweethearts and Wives.\" The only other convivial meetings of our\r\nsmall symposium were on the birthdays of each member, Midwinter's Day\r\nand King's Birthday.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th we were able to make an inventory of a whole series of\r\ndamages effected outside. The dogs' shelter had entirely carried away;\r\na short mast which had been erected some weeks previously as a holdfast\r\nfor sledges was snapped off short and the sledges buried, and, worst of\r\nall, Kennedy's igloo had parted with its roof, the interior being filled\r\nwith snow, underneath which the instruments were buried. The dogs were,\r\nhowever, all quite well and lively. It was fortunate for them that the\r\ntemperature always rose during the blizzards. At this period, when on\r\nfine days it was usual to experience -25 degrees to-37 degrees F., the\r\ntemperature rose in the snowstorms to 25 degrees or even 30 degrees F.\r\n\r\nMonday the 27th was beautifully clear. The tunnel entrance was opened\r\nand some of the party brought in ice while others undid the rope\r\nlashings which had been placed over the hut. This was so compactly\r\ncovered in snow that the lashings were not required and I wanted to make\r\na rope ladder to enable us to get down to the sea-ice and also to be\r\nused by Watson and Hoadley, who were about to dig a shaft in the glacier\r\nto examine the structure of the ice.\r\n\r\nFine weather continued until June 2. During this time we were occupied\r\nin digging a road from the glacier down to the sea-ice in the forenoons\r\nand hunting for seals or skiing in the afternoons. Kennedy and Harrisson\r\nrebuilt the magnetic igloo. A seal-hole was eventually found near the\r\nfoot of the glacier and this was enlarged to enable the seals to come\r\nup.\r\n\r\nAt the end of May, daylight lasted from 9 A.M. until 3 P.M., and the\r\nsunrise and sunset were a marvel of exquisite colour. The nightly\r\ndisplays of aurora australis were not very brilliant as the moon was\r\nnearing the full.\r\n\r\nOn the days of blizzards, there was usually sufficient work to be found\r\nto keep us all employed. Thus on June 2, Watson and I were making a\r\nladder, Jones was contriving a harpoon for seals, Hoadley was opening\r\ncases and stowing stores in the veranda, Dovers cleaning tools, Moyes\r\nrepairing a thermograph and writing up the meteorological log, Harrisson\r\ncooking and Kennedy sleeping after a night-watch.\r\n\r\nBetween June 4 and 22 there was a remarkably fine spell. It was not calm\r\nall the time, as drift flew for a few days, limiting the horizon to a\r\nfew hundred yards. An igloo was built as a shelter for those sinking the\r\ngeological shaft, and seal-hunting was a daily recreation. On June 9,\r\nDovers and Watson found a Weddell seal two and a half miles to the west\r\non the sea-ice. They killed the animal but did not cut it up as there\r\nwere sores on the skin. Jones went over with them afterwards and\r\npronounced the sores to be wounds received from some other animal, so\r\nthe meat was considered innocuous and fifty pounds were brought in,\r\nbeing very welcome after tinned foods. Jones took culture tubes with him\r\nand made smears for bacteria. The tubes were placed in an incubator\r\nand several kinds of organisms grew, very similar to those which infect\r\nwounds in ordinary climates.\r\n\r\nThe snowstorms had by this time built up huge drifts under the lee of\r\nthe ice-cliffs, some of them more than fifty feet in height and reaching\r\nalmost to the top of the ice-shelf. An exhilarating sport was to ski\r\ndown these ramps. The majority of them were very steep and irregular\r\nand it was seldom that any of us escaped without a fall at one time or\r\nanother. Several of the party were thrown from thirty to forty feet,\r\nand, frequently enough, over twenty feet, without being hurt. The only\r\naccident serious enough to disable any one happened to Kennedy on June\r\n19, when he twisted his knee and was laid up for a week.\r\n\r\nThere were many fine displays of the aurora in June, the best being\r\nobserved on the evening of the 18th. Curtains and streamers were showing\r\nfrom four o'clock in the afternoon. Shortly after midnight, Kennedy, who\r\nwas taking magnetic observations, called me to see the most remarkable\r\nexhibition I have so far seen. There was a double curtain 30 degrees\r\nwide unfolded from the eastern horizon through the zenith, with waves\r\nshimmering along it so rapidly that they travelled the whole length of\r\nthe curtain in two seconds. The colouring was brilliant and evanescent.\r\nWhen the waves reached the end of the curtain they spread out to\r\nthe north and rolled in a voluminous billow slowly back to the east.\r\nKennedy's instruments showed that a very great magnetic disturbance\r\nwas in progress during the auroral displays, and particularly on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nHoadley and Watson set up a line of bamboos, a quarter of a mile\r\napart and three miles long, on the 20th, and from thence onwards took\r\nmeasurements for snowfall every fortnight.\r\n\r\nOn Midwinter's Day the temperature ranged from -38 degrees F. to -25\r\ndegrees F. and daylight lasted from 10 A.M. until 4 P.M. We proclaimed a\r\nuniversal holiday throughout Queen Mary Land. Being Saturday, there were\r\na few necessary jobs to be done, but all were finished by 11 A.M. The\r\nmorning was fine and several of us went down to the floe for skiing, but\r\nafter twelve o'clock the sky became overcast and the light was dimmed.\r\nA strong breeze brought along a trail of drift, and at 6 P.M. a heavy\r\nblizzard was in full career. Inside, the hut was decorated with flags\r\nand a savoury dinner was in the throes of preparation. To make the\r\nrepast still more appetising, Harrisson, Hoadley and Dovers devised some\r\nvery pretty and clever menus. Speeches, toasts and a gramophone concert\r\nmade the evening pass quickly and enjoyably.\r\n\r\nFrom this time dated our preparations for spring sledging, which I\r\nhoped would commence about August 15. Jones made some experiments with\r\n\"glaxo,\" of which we had a generous supply. His aim was to make biscuits\r\nwhich would be suitable for sledging, and, after several failures, he\r\nsucceeded in compressing with a steel die a firm biscuit of glaxo and\r\nbutter mixed, three ounces of which was the equivalent in theoretical\r\nfood value to four and a half ounces of plasmon biscuit; thereby\r\naffording a pleasant variety in the usual ration.\r\n\r\nJuly came in quietly, though it was dull and cloudy, and we were able to\r\nget out on the first two days for work and exercise. On the 2nd a\r\nvery fine effect was caused by the sun shining through myriads of\r\nfog-crystals which a light northerly breeze had brought down from the\r\nsea. The sun, which was barely clear of the horizon, was itself a deep\r\nred, on either side and above it was a red mock sun and a rainbow-tinted\r\nhalo connected the three mock suns.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th and 6th the wind blew a terrific hurricane (judged to reach\r\na velocity of one hundred miles per hour) and, had we not known that\r\nnothing short of an earthquake could move the hut, we should have been\r\nvery uneasy.\r\n\r\nAll were now busy making food-bags, opening and breaking up pemmican\r\nand emergency rations, grinding biscuits, attending to personal gear and\r\ndoing odd jobs many and various.\r\n\r\nIn addition to recreations like chess, cards and dominoes, a competition\r\nwas started for each member to write a poem and short article, humorous\r\nor otherwise, connected with the Expedition. These were all read by the\r\nauthors after dinner one evening and caused considerable amusement.\r\nOne man even preferred to sing his poem. These literary efforts were\r\nincorporated in a small publication known as \"The Glacier Tongue.\"\r\n\r\nWatson and Hoadley put in a good deal of time digging their shaft in the\r\nglacier. As a roofed shelter had been built over the top, they were able\r\nto work in all but the very worst weather. While the rest of us were\r\nfitting sledges on the 17th and 18th, they succeeded in getting down to\r\na level of twenty-one feet below the surface of the shelf-ice.\r\n\r\nSandow, the leader of the dogs, disappeared on the 18th. Zip, who had\r\nbeen missed for two days, returned, but Sandow never came back, being\r\nkilled, doubtless, by a fall of snow from the cliffs. All along the edge\r\nof the ice-shelf were snow cornices, some weighing hundreds of tons; and\r\nthese often broke away, collapsing with a thunderous sound. On July 31,\r\nHarrisson and Watson had a narrow escape. After finishing their day's\r\nwork, they climbed down to the floe by a huge cornice and sloping ramp.\r\nA few seconds later, the cornice fell and an immense mass of hard snow\r\ncrashed down, cracking the sea-ice for more than a hundred yards around.\r\n\r\nJuly had been an inclement month with three really fine and eight\r\ntolerable days. In comparison with June's, which was -14.5 degrees F.,\r\nthe mean temperature of July was high at -1.5 degrees F. and the early\r\nhalf of August was little better.\r\n\r\nSunday August 11 was rather an eventful day. Dovers and I went out\r\nin the wind to attend to the dogs and clear the chimney and, upon\r\nour return, found the others just recovering from rather an exciting\r\naccident. Jones had been charging the acetylene generators and by some\r\nmeans one of them caught fire. For a while there was the danger of a\r\ngeneral conflagration and explosion, as the gas-tank was floating in\r\nkerosene. Throwing water over everything would have made matters\r\nworse, so blankets were used to smother the flames. As this failed to\r\nextinguish them, the whole plant was pulled down and carried into the\r\ntunnel, where the fire was at last put out. The damage amounted to two\r\nblankets singed and dirtied, Jones's face scorched and hair singed, and\r\nKennedy, one finger jammed. It was a fortunate escape from a calamity.\r\n\r\nA large capsized berg had been noticed for some time, eleven miles to\r\nthe north. On the 14th, Harrisson, Dovers, Hoadley and Watson took\r\nthree days' provisions and equipment and went off to examine it. A brief\r\naccount is extracted from Harrisson's diary:\r\n\r\n\"It was a particularly fine, mild morning; we made good progress, three\r\ndogs dragging the loaded sledge over the smooth floe without difficulty,\r\nrequiring assistance only when crossing banks of soft snow. One and a\r\nhalf miles from 'The Steps,' we saw the footprints of a penguin.\r\n\r\n\"Following the cliffs of the shelf-ice for six and three quarter miles,\r\nwe sighted a Weddell seal sleeping on a drift of snow. Killing the\r\nanimal, cutting off the meat and burying it in the drift delayed us for\r\nabout one hour. Continuing our journey under a fine bluff, over floe-ice\r\nmuch cracked by tide-pressure, we crossed a small bay cutting wedge-like\r\ninto the glacier and camped on its far side.\r\n\r\n\"After our midday meal we walked to the berg three miles away. When seen\r\non June 28, this berg was tilted to the north-east, but the opposite\r\nend, apparently in contact with the ice-cliffs, had lifted higher than\r\nthe glacier-shelf itself. From a distance it could be seen that the\r\nsides, for half their height, were wave-worn and smooth. Three or four\r\nacres of environing floe were buckled, ploughed up and in places heaped\r\ntwenty feet high, while several large fragments of the broken floe were\r\npoised aloft on the old 'water-line' of the berg.\r\n\r\n\"However, on this visit, we found that the berg had turned completely\r\nover towards the cliffs and was now floating on its side surrounded by\r\nlarge separate chunks; all locked fast in the floe. In what had been the\r\nbottom of the berg Hoadley and Watson made an interesting find of stones\r\nand pebbles--the first found in this dead land!\r\n\r\n\"Leaving them collecting, I climbed the pitted wave-worn ice, brittle\r\nand badly cracked on the higher part. The highest point was fifty feet\r\nabove the level of the top of the shelf-ice. There was no sign of open\r\nwater to the north, but a few seals were observed sleeping under the\r\ncliffs.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning the weather thickened and the wind arose, so a start\r\nwas made for the Base. All that day the party groped along in the\r\ncomparative shelter of the cliff-face until forced to camp. It was not\r\ntill the next afternoon in moderate drift that a pair of skis which had\r\nbeen left at the foot of 'The Steps' were located and the hut reached\r\nonce again.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch on August 11, while we were excavating some buried kerosene,\r\nJones sighted a group of seven Emperor penguins two miles away over the\r\nwestern floe. Taking a sledge and camera we made after them. A mile off,\r\nthey saw us and advanced with their usual stately bows. It seemed an\r\nawful shame to kill them, but we were sorely in need of fresh meat. The\r\nfour we secured averaged seventy pounds in weight and were a heavy load\r\nup the steep rise to the glacier; but our reward came at dinner-time.\r\n\r\nWith several fine days to give us confidence, everything was made ready\r\nfor the sledge journey on August 20. The party was to consist of six men\r\nand three dogs, the object of the journey being to lay out a food-depot\r\nto the east in view of the long summer journey we were to make in that\r\ndirection. Hoadley and Kennedy were to remain at the Base, the former\r\nto finish the geological shaft and the latter for magnetic work. There\r\nremained also a good deal to do preparing stores for later sledge\r\njourneys.\r\n\r\nThe load was to be one thousand four hundred and forty pounds\r\ndistributed over three sledges; two hundred pounds heavier than on the\r\nMarch Journey, but as the dogs pulled one sledge, the actual weight per\r\nman was less.\r\n\r\nThe rations were almost precisely the same as those used by Shackleton\r\nduring his Expedition, and the daily allowance was exactly the\r\nsame--thirty-four ounces per man per day. For his one ounce of oatmeal,\r\nthe same weighs of ground biscuit was substituted; the food value being\r\nthe same. On the second depot journey and the main summer journeys, a\r\nthree-ounce glaxo biscuit was used in place of four and a half ounces of\r\nplasmon biscuit. Instead of taking cheese and chocolate as the luncheon\r\nration, I took chocolate alone, as on Shackleton's southern journey it\r\nwas found more satisfactory than the cheese, though the food value was\r\npractically the same.\r\n\r\nThe sledging equipment and clothing were identical with that used by\r\nShackleton. Jaeger fleece combination suits were included in the outfit\r\nbut, though excellent garments for work at the Base, they were much too\r\nheavy for sledging. We therefore wore Jaeger underclothing and burberry\r\nwind clothing as overalls.\r\n\r\nThe weather was not propitious for a start until Thursday, August 22.\r\nWe turned out at 5.30 A.M., had breakfast, packed up and left the Hut at\r\nseven o'clock.\r\n\r\nAfter two good days' work under a magnificently clear sky, with the\r\ntemperature often as low as -34 degrees F., we sighted two small\r\nnunataks among a cluster of pressure-ridges, eight miles to the south.\r\nIt was the first land, in the sense of rocks, seen for more than seven\r\nmonths. We hoped to visit the outcrops--Gillies Nunataks--on our return.\r\n\r\nThe course next day was due east and parallel to the mainland, then ten\r\nmiles distant. To the north was Masson Island, while at about the same\r\ndistance and ahead was a smaller island, entirely ice-covered like the\r\nformer--Henderson Island.\r\n\r\nA blizzard of three days' duration kept us in camp between August 27 and\r\n30. Jones, Moyes and I had a three-man sleeping-bag, and the temperature\r\nbeing high, 11 degrees to 15 degrees F., we were very warm, but\r\nthoroughly tired of lying down for so long. Harrisson, Dovers and Watson\r\nhad single bags and therefore less room in the other tent.\r\n\r\nThe last day of August was beautifully bright: temperature -12 degrees\r\nto -15 degrees F. We passed Henderson Island in the forenoon,\r\nand, hauling up a rise to the south of it, had a good view of the\r\nsurroundings. On the right, the land ran back to form a large bay,\r\nseventeen miles wide. This was later named the Bay of Winds, as a \"blow\"\r\nwas always encountered while crossing it.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the bay was a nunatak, which from its shape at once\r\nreceived the name of the Alligator. In front, apparently fifteen miles\r\noff, was another nunatak, the Hippo, and four definite outcrops--Delay\r\nPoint and Avalanche Rocks--could be seen along the mainland. The sight\r\nof this bare rock was very pleasing, as we had begun to think we were\r\ngoing to find nothing but ice-sheathed land. Dovers took a round of\r\nangles to all the prominent points.\r\n\r\nThe Hippo was twenty-two miles away, so deceptive is distance in these\r\nlatitudes; and in one and a half days, over very heavy sastrugi, we were\r\nin its vicinity. The sledges could not be brought very near the rock as\r\nit was surrounded by massive ridges of pressure-ice.\r\n\r\nWe climbed to the top of the nunatak which was four hundred and twenty\r\nfeet high, four hundred yards long and two hundred yards wide. It was\r\ncomposed of gneissic granite and schists. Dovers took angles from an\r\neminence, Watson collected geological specimens and Harrisson sketched\r\nuntil his fingers were frost-bitten. Moss and lichens were found and a\r\ndead snow petrel--a young one--showing that the birds must breed in the\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nTo the south, the glacier shelf appeared to be very little broken,\r\nbut to the north it was terribly torn and twisted. At each end of the\r\nnunatak there was a very fine bergschrund.** Twenty miles to the east\r\nthere appeared to be an uncovered rocky islet; the mainland turning\r\nto the southward twelve miles away. During the night the minimum\r\nthermometer registered -47 degrees F.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** The term not used in the usual sense.  Referring to a wide,\r\nimposing crevasse caused by the division of the ice as it presses past\r\nthe nunatak.--ED.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to get away next morning was frustrated by a strong gale. We\r\nwere two hundred yards from the shelter of the Hippo and were forced to\r\nturn back, since it was difficult to keep one's feet, while the sledges\r\nwere blown sideways over the neve surface.\r\n\r\nI resolved to leave the depot in this place and return to the Base,\r\nfor our sleeping-bags were getting very wet and none of the party were\r\nhaving sufficient sleep. We were eighty-four miles from the hut; I had\r\nhoped to do one hundred miles, but we could make up for that by starting\r\nthe summer journey a few days earlier. One sledge was left here as well\r\nas six weeks' allowance of food for three men, except tea, of which\r\nthere was sufficient for fifty days, seventy days oil and seventy-eight\r\ndays' biscuit. The sledge was placed on end in a hole three feet deep\r\nand a mound built up around it, six feet high; a bamboo and flag being\r\nlashed to the top.\r\n\r\nOn September 4 we were homeward bound, heading first to the mainland\r\nleaving Delay Point on our left, to examine some of the outcrops of\r\nrock. Reaching the coast about 3 P.M., camp was shortly afterwards\r\npitched in a most beautiful spot. A wall of solid rock rose sheer for\r\nover four hundred feet and was crowned by an ice-cap half the thickness.\r\nGrand ice-falls surged down on either side.\r\n\r\nThe tents were erected in what appeared to be a sheltered hollow, a\r\nquarter of a mile from Avalanche Rocks. One tent was up and we were\r\nsetting the other in position when the wind suddenly veered right round\r\nto the east and flattened out both tents. It was almost as humorous as\r\nannoying. They were soon raised up once more, facing the other way.\r\n\r\nWhile preparing for bed, a tremendous avalanche came down. The noise\r\nwas awful and seemed so close that we all turned to the door and started\r\nout. The fastening of the entrance was knotted, the people from the\r\nother tent were yelling to us to come out, so we dragged up the bottom\r\nof the tent and dived beneath it.\r\n\r\nThe cliff was entirely hidden by a cloud of snow, and, though\r\nthe crashing had now almost ceased, we stood ready to run, Dovers\r\nthoughtfully seizing a food-bag. However, none of the blocks had come\r\nwithin a hundred yards of us, and as it was now blowing hard, all hands\r\nelected to remain where they were.\r\n\r\nSeveral more avalanches, which had broken away near the edge of the\r\nmainland, disturbed our sleep through the night, but they were not quite\r\nso alarming as the first one. A strong breeze was blowing at daybreak;\r\nstill the weather was not too bad for travelling, and so I called the\r\nparty. Moyes and I lashed up our bags, passed them out and strapped them\r\non the sledge; Jones, in the meantime, starting the cooker. Suddenly a\r\nterrific squall struck the front of our tent, the poles burst through\r\nthe apex, and the material split from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nMoyes and I were both knocked down. When we found our feet again, we\r\nwent to the aid of the other men, whose tent had survived the gust. The\r\nwind rushed by more madly than ever, and the only thing to do was to\r\npull away the poles and allow the tent to collapse.\r\n\r\nLooking around for a lee where it could be raised, we found the only\r\navailable shelter to be a crevasse three hundred yards to windward, but\r\nthe wind was now so strong that it was impossible to convey the gear\r\neven to such a short distance. All were frequently upset and blown along\r\nthe surface twenty or thirty yards, and, even with an ice-axe, one could\r\nnot always hold his own. The only resort was to dig a shelter.\r\n\r\nSetting to work, we excavated a hole three feet deep, twelve feet long\r\nand six feet wide; the snow being so compact that the job occupied three\r\nhours. The sledges and tent-poles were placed across the hole, the good\r\ntent being laid on top and weighted down with snow and blocks of ice.\r\nAll this sounds very easy, but it was a slow and difficult task. Many\r\nof the gusts must have exceeded one hundred miles per hour, since one of\r\nthem lifted Harrisson who was standing beside me, clean over my head and\r\nthrew him nearly twenty feet. Everything movable was stowed in the\r\nhole, and at noon we had a meal and retired into sleeping-bags. At three\r\no'clock a weighty avalanche descended, its fearful crash resounding\r\nabove the roar of the wind. I have never found anything which gave me a\r\nmore uncomfortable feeling than those avalanches.\r\n\r\nThe gale continued on September 6, and we still remained packed in the\r\ntrench. If the latter had been deeper and it had been possible to sit\r\nupright, we should have been quite comfortable. To make matters worse,\r\nseveral more avalanches came down, and all of them sounded horribly\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nWe were confined in our burrow for five days, the wind continuing\r\nto blow with merciless force. Through being closed up so much, the\r\ntemperature of the hole rose above freezing-point, consequently our\r\nsleeping-bags and clothes became very wet.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday September 8, Moyes went out to feed the dogs and to bring in\r\nsome biscuit. He found a strong gusty wind with falling snow, and drift\r\nso thick that he could not see five yards. We had a cold lunch with\r\nnothing to drink, so that the primus should not raise the temperature.\r\nIn the evening we sang hymns and between us managed to remember the\r\nwords of at least a dozen.\r\n\r\nThe long confinement was over on the 10th; the sky was blue and the sun\r\nbrilliant, though the wind still pulsated with racking gusts. As soon\r\nas we were on the ice, away from the land, two men had to hold on to the\r\nrear of each sledge, and even then capsizes often occurred. The sledge\r\nwould turn and slide broadside-on to leeward, tearing the runners badly\r\non the rough ice. Still, by 9.30 A.M. the surface changed to snow and\r\nthe travelling improved. That night we camped with twenty miles one\r\nhundred yards on the meter.\r\n\r\nThere was a cold blizzard on the 11th with a temperature of -30 degrees\r\nF. Confined in the tents, we found our sleeping-bags still sodden and\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nWith a strong beam wind and in moderate drift big marches were made for\r\ntwo days, during which the compass and sastrugi determined our course.\r\n\r\nMy diary of September 14 runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"On the march at 7 A.M.; by noon we had done twelve miles one thousand\r\nfive hundred yards. Lunch was hurried, as we were all anxious to get to\r\nthe hut to-night, especially we in the three-man bag, as it got so wet\r\nwhile we were living underground that we have had very little sleep and\r\nplenty of shivering for the last four nights. Last night I had no sleep\r\nat all. By some means, in the afternoon, we got on the wrong course.\r\nEither the compass was affected or a mistake had been made in some of\r\nthe bearings, as instead of reaching home by 5 P.M. we were travelling\r\ntill 8 P.M. and have done thirty-two miles one thousand one hundred\r\nyards. Light loads, good surface and a fair wind account for the good\r\ntravelling, the sail doing almost all the work on the man-hauled sledge.\r\n\r\n\"The last two hours we were in the dark, except for a young moon,\r\namongst a lot of crevasses and pressure-ridges which none of us could\r\nrecognize. At one time, we found ourselves on a slope within a dozen\r\nyards of the edge of the glacier; this decided me to camp. Awfully\r\ndisappointing; anticipating another wretched night. Temperature-35\r\ndegrees F.\"\r\n\r\nNext day we reached home. The last camp had been four and a half miles\r\nnorth of the hut. I found that we had gone wrong through using 149\r\ndegrees as the bearing of Masson Island from the Base, when it should\r\nhave been 139 degrees. I believe it was my own mistake, as I gave the\r\nbearing to Dovers and he is very careful.\r\n\r\nBefore having a meal, we were all weighed and found the average loss to\r\nbe eight pounds. In the evening, Moyes and I weighed ourselves again; he\r\nhad gained seven pounds and I five and three-quarter pounds.\r\n\r\nComparing notes with Hoadley and Kennedy, I found that the weather at\r\nthe Base had been similar to that experienced on the sledging journey.\r\n\r\nIt was now arranged that Jones was to take charge of the main western\r\njourney in the summer. While looking for a landing-place in the\r\n'Aurora', we had noted to the west an expanse of old, fast floe,\r\nextending for at least fifty miles. The idea was for Jones and party\r\nto march along this floe and lay a depot on the land as far west as was\r\npossible in four weeks. The party included Dovers, Harrisson, Hoadley\r\nand Moyes. They were to be assisted by the dogs.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to take Kennedy and Watson up to the depot we had\r\nleft on the hills in March, bringing back the minimum thermometer and\r\nprobably some of the food. Watson was slightly lame at the time, as he\r\nhad bruised his foot on the last trip.\r\n\r\nUntil Jones made a start on September 26, there were ten days of almost\r\ncontinuous wind and drift. The equinox may have accounted for this\r\nprolonged period of atrocious weather. No time, however, was wasted\r\nindoors. Weighing and bagging food, repairing tents, poles, cookers and\r\nother gear damaged on the last journey and sewing and mending clothes\r\ngave every man plenty of employment.\r\n\r\nAt 6 A.M. on the 26th, Jones reported that there was only a little low\r\ndrift and that the wind was dying away. All hands were therefore called\r\nand breakfast served.\r\n\r\nWatson, Kennedy and I assisted the others down to the sea-ice by a long\r\nsloping snow-drift and saw them off to a good start in a south-westerly\r\ndirection. We found that the heavy sledge used for carrying ice had been\r\nblown more then five hundred yards to the edge of the glacier, capsized\r\namong the rough pressure-slabs and broken. Two heavy boxes which were on\r\nthe sledge had disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was devoted to clearing stores out of the tunnels.\r\nIt was evident to us that with the advent of warmer weather, the roof\r\nof the caves or grottoes (by the way, the hut received the name of\r\n\"The Grottoes\") would sink, and so it was advisable to repack the cases\r\noutside rather than dig them out of the deep snow. By 6 P.M. nearly two\r\nhundred boxes were passed up through the trap-door and the caverns were\r\nall empty.\r\n\r\nAfter two days of blizzard, Watson, Kennedy and I broke trail with loads\r\nof one hundred and seventy pounds per man. Right from the start the\r\nsurface was so soft that pulling became very severe. On the first day,\r\nSeptember 29, we managed to travel more than nine miles, but during\r\nthe next six days the snow became deeper and more impassable, and only\r\nnineteen miles were covered. Crevasses were mostly invisible, and on the\r\nslope upwards to the ice-cap more troublesome than usual. The weather\r\nkept up its invariable wind and drift. Finally, after making laborious\r\nheadway to two thousand feet, Kennedy strained his Achilles tendon and I\r\ndecided to return to \"The Grottoes.\"\r\n\r\nAt 2 P.M. on October 8, the mast was sighted and we climbed down\r\ninto the Hut, finding it very cold, empty and dark. The sun had\r\nshone powerfully that day and Kennedy and Watson had a touch of\r\nsnow-blindness.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks went by and there was no sign of the western depot party. In\r\nfact, out of sixteen days, there were thirteen of thick drift and high\r\nwind, so that our sympathies went out to the men in tents with soaking\r\nbags, waiting patiently for a rift in the driving wall of snow. On\r\nOctober 23 they had been away for four weeks; provisions for that time\r\nhaving been taken. I had no doubt that they would be on reduced rations,\r\nand, if the worst came, they could eat the dogs.\r\n\r\nDuring a lull on October 24, I went to the masthead with the\r\nfield-glasses but saw nothing of the party. On that day we weighed out\r\nprovisions and made ready to go in search of them. It was my intention\r\nto go on the outward track for a week. I wrote instructions to Jones to\r\nhoist a large flag on the mast, and to burn flares each night at 10 P.M.\r\nif he should return while I was away.\r\n\r\nThere was a fresh gale with blinding drift early on the following\r\nmorning; so we postponed the start. At 4 P.M. the wind subsided to\r\na strong breeze and I again went up the mast to sweep the horizon.\r\nWestward from an icy cape to the south a gale was still blowing and a\r\nheavy cloud of drift, fifty to sixty feet high, obscured everything.\r\n\r\nAn hour later Watson saw three Adelie penguins approaching across the\r\nfloe and we went down to meet them, bringing them in for the larder.\r\nFour Antarctic petrels flew above our heads: a sign of returning summer\r\nwhich was very cheering.\r\n\r\nThe previous night had promised a fine day and we were not disappointed\r\non October 26. A sledge was packed with fourteen days' provisions for\r\neight men and we started away on a search expedition at 10 A.M.\r\n\r\nAfter doing a little over nine miles we camped at 5.30 P.M. Before\r\nretiring to bag, I had a last look round and was delighted to see Jones\r\nand his party about a mile to the south. It was now getting dark and we\r\nwere within two hundred yards of them before being seen, and, as they\r\nwere to windward, they could not hear our shouts. It was splendid\r\nto find them all looking well. They were anxious to get back to \"The\r\nGrottoes,\" considering there was only one serviceable tent between them.\r\nKennedy and I offered to change with any of them but, being too eager\r\nfor warm blankets and a good bed, they trudged on, arriving at the Base\r\nat midnight.\r\n\r\nBriefly told, their story was that they were stopped in their westerly\r\nmarch, when forty-five miles had been covered, by a badly broken\r\nglacier--Helen Glacier--on the far side of which there was open sea.\r\nThere was only one thing to do and that was to set out for the mainland\r\nby a course so circuitous that they were brought a long way eastward,\r\nback towards \"The Grottoes.\" They had very rough travelling, bad\r\nweather, and were beset with many difficulties in mounting on to the\r\nland-ice, where the depot had to be placed. Their distance from the\r\nBase at this point was only twenty-eight miles and the altitude was one\r\nthousand feet above sea-level. On the ice-cap they were delayed by a\r\nblizzard and for seventeen days--an unexampled time--they were unable to\r\nmove from camp. One tent collapsed and the occupants, Jones, Dovers and\r\nHoadley, had to dig a hole in the snow and lower the tent into it.\r\n\r\nThese are a few snatches from Jones's diary:\r\n\r\n\"The next sixteen days (following Wednesday, October 9) were spent at\r\nthis camp.... Harrisson and Moyes occupied one tent and Dovers, Hoadley\r\nand myself the other.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday, the third day of the blizzard, the wind which had been\r\nblowing steadily from the east-south-east veered almost to east and the\r\ntents commenced to flog terrifically. This change must have occurred\r\nearly in the night, for we awoke at 5 A.M. to find clouds of snow\r\nblowing under the skirt on one side: the heavy pile on the flounce\r\nhaving been cut away by the wind. As it would have been impossible to do\r\nanything outside, we pulled the tent poles together and allowed the tent\r\nto collapse. The rest of the day was spent in confined quarters, eating\r\ndry rations and melting snow in our mugs by the warmth of our bodies....\r\nAlthough Harrisson and Moyes were no more than twenty feet from us, the\r\nnoise of the gale and the flogging of our tents rendered communication\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\"The terrible flapping at last caused one of the seams of our tent to\r\ntear; we sewed it as well as we were able and hoped that it would hold\r\ntill daylight.\r\n\r\n\"On Monday morning, the same seam again parted and we decided to let the\r\ntent down again, spending the day in a half-reclining position....\r\n\r\n\"At 6.30 P.M. the gale eased and, during a comparative lull, Moyes came\r\nout to feed the dogs. Noticing our position, he helped us to re-erect\r\nthe tent and Dovers then went out and piled snow over the torn seam.\r\nMoyes said that Harrisson and he had been fairly comfortable, although\r\nthe cap of their tent was slowly tearing with the pressure of the wind\r\nand snow on the weather panels....\r\n\r\n\"On Friday, the 18th, Swiss, one of the dogs, returned very thin after\r\nsix days' absence from the camp.\r\n\r\n\"On the following Monday the blizzard moderated somewhat and we\r\nproceeded to make our quarters more roomy by digging out the floor and\r\nundercutting the sides, thus lowering the level about eighteen inches.\r\n\r\n\"Our tent now looks as if it were half blown over. To relieve the\r\ntremendous strain on the cap, we lowered the feet of the two lee poles\r\non to the new floor. The tent now offered very little resistance to the\r\nwind. We were able to communicate with Harrisson and Moyes and they said\r\nthey were all right.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the snow and wind at last held up, they immediately made down\r\nto the sea-ice and back towards home, and, when they met us, had done\r\nnineteen miles. All were stiff next day, and no wonder; a march\r\nof twenty-eight miles after lying low for seventeen days is a very\r\nstrenuous day's work.\r\n\r\nPreparations were made on October 28 for the main eastern summer\r\njourney, the object of which was to survey as much coast-line as\r\npossible and at the same time to carry on geological work, surveying and\r\nmagnetics. The party was to consist of Kennedy, Watson and myself.\r\n\r\nJones, Dovers and Hoadley were to start on the main western journey on\r\nNovember 2. I arranged that Harrisson and Moyes should remain at the\r\nHut, the latter to carry on meteorological work, and Harrisson biology\r\nand sketching. Later, Harrisson proposed to accompany me as far as the\r\nHippo depot, bringing the dogs and providing a supporting party. At\r\nfirst I did not like the idea, as he would have to travel one hundred\r\nmiles alone, but he showed me that he could erect a tent by himself\r\nand, as summer and better weather were in sight, I agreed that he should\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nEach party was taking fourteen weeks' provisions, and I had an\r\nadditional four weeks' supply for Harrisson and the dogs. My total load\r\ncame to nine hundred and seventy pounds; the dogs pulling four hundred\r\npounds with the assistance of one man and three of us dragging five\r\nhundred and seventy pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI THE WESTERN BASE--BLOCKED ON THE SHELF-ICE\r\n\r\nby F. Wild\r\n\r\n\r\nWe started away on the main eastern journey with a spurt of eleven miles\r\non a calm and cloudless day, intending to follow our former track over\r\nthe shelf-ice to the Hippo Nunatak. The surface varied; soft patches\r\nputting a steady brake on the ardour of the first, fresh hours of\r\nmarching.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, it was only necessary to wear a shirt, singlet, heavy\r\npyjama trousers, finnesko and socks, and even then one perspired freely.\r\nThe temperature stood at 17 degrees F. The dogs pulled their load well,\r\nrequiring help only over loose snow.\r\n\r\nThe evening of Friday November 1, 1912, saw us past Masson Island\r\nand about ten miles from the mainland. All day there had been a chill\r\neasterly breeze, the temperature being well below zero. The sky was hazy\r\nwith cirro-stratus and a fine halo \"ringed\" the sun.\r\n\r\nLooking out from the tent in the morning we saw that the clouds were\r\ndense and lowering, but the breezes were light and variable until 5\r\nP.M., when an east-north-east wind arose, bringing snow in its train.\r\nTravelling through foggy drift, we could just ascertain that the Bay\r\nof Winds had opened up on the right. The day's march was a good one of\r\nsixteen miles thirty-five yards.\r\n\r\nThe Bay of Winds did not belie its name. Throughout November 3 the\r\nwind veered about in gusts and after lunch settled down to a hard\r\nsouth-easter.\r\n\r\nWe had made a good start; more than sixty-two miles in a little over\r\nfour days. The camp was half-way across the Bay of Winds, with the\r\nAlligator Nunatak six miles off on the \"starboard bow\" and the Rock of\r\nthe Avalanches seventeen miles straight ahead. Passing glimpses were\r\ncaught of the Hippo twenty-four miles distant.\r\n\r\nOn November 5, after a day's blizzard, there was much accumulated snow\r\nto shovel away from tents and sledges. Finding the hauling very\r\narduous, we headed in for the land to find a better surface, passing the\r\nAlligator Nunatak close on its southern side.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the 6th, the sledges were running parallel to the Rock of\r\nthe Avalanches, three miles away, and soon afterwards we came to a large\r\nboulder; one of four in a line from the rock-cliffs, from which they had\r\nbeen evidently transported, as they were composed of the same gneiss.\r\n\r\nThe Hippo was close at hand at four o'clock and, on nearing the\r\nshattered ice about the depot, we released the dogs and pulled the\r\nsledge ourselves. On being freed, they galloped over to the rock and\r\nwere absent for over an hour. When they returned, Amundsen's head was\r\ndaubed with egg-yolk, as we thought. This was most probable as scores of\r\nsnow petrels were flying about the rocks.\r\n\r\nA nasty shock was awaiting us at the depot. The sledge, which had been\r\nleft on end, two feet buried in hard snow and with a mound six feet high\r\nbuilt round it, had been blown completely away. The stays, secured to\r\nfoodbags, were both broken; one food-bag weighing sixty-eight pounds\r\nhaving been lifted ten feet. This was a very serious loss as the total\r\nload to be carried now amounted to one thousand one hundred and eighty\r\npounds, which was too great a weight to be supported by one sledge.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, then, that the only thing to do was to include Harrisson in\r\nthe party, so that we could have his sledge. This would facilitate our\r\nprogress considerably, but against that was the fact that Moyes would be\r\nleft alone at the Base under the belief that Harrisson had perished.\r\n\r\nA gale was blowing on the 7th, but as we were partly under the lee of\r\nthe Hippo, it was only felt in gusts. A visit was made to the Nunatak;\r\nHarrisson to examine the birds, Watson for geology and photography,\r\nwhile I climbed to the summit with the field-glasses to look for\r\nthe missing sledge. Kennedy remained at the camp to take a series of\r\nmagnetic observations.\r\n\r\nThere were hundreds of snow petrels pairing off, but no eggs were seen\r\nin any of the nest-crevices. They were so tame that it was quite easy\r\nto catch them, but they had a habit of ejecting their partially digested\r\nfood, a yellow oily mess, straight at one. This was the stuff we had\r\nthought was egg-yolk on Amundsen's head the previous night.\r\n\r\nUpon returning to camp, the search for the sledge was continued. After\r\nprospecting with a spade in possible snow-drifts and crevasse-lids, we\r\nwalked out fanwise, in the direction of the prevailing wind, but with no\r\nresult. I decided, therefore, to take Harrisson with me. I was extremely\r\nsorry for Moyes, but it could not be helped.\r\n\r\nOn the way back towards the land to the south, we found that the surface\r\nhad improved in the morning's gale. Camp was finally pitched on a slope\r\nclose to the high land.\r\n\r\nThe coast, from the Base to this spot--Delay Point--runs almost due east\r\nand west and with no deep indentations except the Bay of Winds. To the\r\nwest, the slope from the inland plateau is fairly gradual and therefore\r\nnot badly broken, but still farther west it is much steeper, coming\r\ndown from two thousand feet in a very short distance, over tumbling\r\nice-fields and frozen cascades. Several outcrops of dark rock lay to the\r\neast, one of them only two miles away.\r\n\r\nThe wind-velocity fluctuated between sixty and eighty miles per hour,\r\nkeeping us securely penned. Harrisson and Kennedy, after battling their\r\nway to our tent for a meal, used the second primus and cooker, brought\r\nfor Harrisson, in their own tent. All we could do was to smoke and\r\nlisten to the fierce squalls and lashing drift. I had brought nothing to\r\nread on the trip, making up the weight in tobacco. Watson had Palgrave's\r\n'Golden Lyrics', Kennedy, an engineer's hand-book, and Harrisson, a\r\nportion of the 'Reign of Mary Tudor'. There was a tiny pack of patience\r\ncards, but they were in the instrument-box on the sledge and none of us\r\ncared to face the gale to get them.\r\n\r\nThe wind, on the 10th, saw fit to moderate to half a gale; the drift\r\ncreeping low and thick over the ground; the land visible above it.\r\nDonning burberrys, we made an excursion to the rocks ahead. Two miles\r\nand a climb of six hundred feet were rather exhausting in the strong\r\nwind. There were about eighty acres of rock exposed on the edge of the\r\nice-cap, mainly composed of mica schists and some granite; the whole\r\nextensively weathered. A line of moraine ran from the rocks away in an\r\neast-north-east direction.\r\n\r\nMost of the next day was broken by a heavy gale and, since the prospect\r\nahead was nothing but bare, rough ice, we passed the day in making\r\neverything ready for a start and repaired a torn tent. The rent was made\r\nby Amundsen, who dragged up the ice-axe to which he was tethered and, in\r\nrunning round the tent, drove the point of the axe through it, narrowly\r\nmissing Kennedy's head inside.\r\n\r\nTuesday November 12 was an interesting day. The greater part of the\r\ntrack was over rippled, level ice, thrown into many billows, through\r\ndevious pressure-hummocks and between the inevitable crevasses. The\r\ncoast was a kaleidoscope of sable rocks, blue cascades, and fissured\r\nice-falls. Fifteen miles ahead stood an island twenty miles long, rising\r\nin bare peaks and dark knolls. This was eventually named David Island.\r\n\r\nThe dogs were working very well and, if only a little additional food\r\ncould be procured for them, I knew they could be kept alive. Zip broke\r\nloose one night and ate one of my socks which was hanging on the sledge\r\nto dry; it probably tasted of seal blubber from the boots. Switzerland,\r\ntoo, was rather a bother, eating his harness whenever he had a chance.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, a depot was formed, consisting of one week's provisions\r\nand oil; the bags being buried and a mound erected with a flag on top.\r\nKennedy took a round of angles to determine its position.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two snowy days, after we had avoided many ugly crevasses,\r\nour course in an east-south-east line pointed to a narrow strait between\r\nDavid Island and the mainland. On the southern side of the former, there\r\nwas a heaped line of pressure-ice, caused by the flow from a narrow\r\nbay being stopped by the Island. After lunch, on the 16th, there was an\r\nhour's good travelling and then we suddenly pulled into a half-mile of\r\nbroken surface--the confluence of the slowly moving land-ice and of the\r\nmore rapidly moving ice from a valley on our right, from which issued\r\nReid Glacier. It was impossible to steer the dogs through it with a\r\nload, so we lightened the loads on both sledges and then made several\r\njourneys backwards and forwards over the more broken areas, allowing the\r\ndogs to run loose. The crevasses ran tortuously in every direction\r\nand falls into them were not uncommon. One large lid fell in just as a\r\nsledge had cleared it, leaving a hole twelve feet wide, and at least a\r\nhundred feet deep. Once over this zone, the sledges were worked along\r\nthe slope leading to the mainland where we were continually worried by\r\ntheir slipping sideways.\r\n\r\nAhead was a vast sea of crushed ice, tossed and piled in every\r\ndirection. On the northern horizon rose what we concluded to be a\r\nflat-topped, castellated berg. Ten days later, it resolved itself into a\r\ntract of heavy pressure ridges.\r\n\r\nCamping after nine and a half miles, we were surprised, on moving\r\neast in the morning, to sight clearly the point--Cape Gerlache--of\r\na peninsula running inland to the southwest. A glacier from the\r\nhinterland, pushing out from its valley, had broken up the shelf-ice on\r\nwhich we were travelling to such an extent that nothing without wings\r\ncould cross it. Our object was to map in the coastline as far east as\r\npossible, and the problem, now, was whether to go north or south. From\r\nour position the former looked the best, the tumbled shelf-ice appearing\r\nto smooth out sufficiently, about ten miles away, to afford a passage\r\neast, while, to the south, we scanned the Denman Glacier, as it was\r\nnamed, rolling in magnificent cascades, twelve miles in breadth, from a\r\nheight of more than three thousand feet. To get round the head of this\r\nice-stream would mean travelling inland for at least thirty miles.\r\n\r\nSo north we went, getting back to our old surface over a heavy \"cross\r\nsea,\" honeycombed with pits and chasms; many of them with no visible\r\nbottom. There was half a mile to safety, but the area had to be crossed\r\nfive times; the load on the twelve-foot sledge being so much, that half\r\nthe weight was taken off and the empty sledges brought back for the\r\nother half. Last of all came the dogs' sledge. Kennedy remarked during\r\nthe afternoon that he felt like a fly walking on wire-netting.\r\n\r\nThe camp was pitched in a line of pressure, with wide crevasses and\r\n\"hell-holes\" within a few yards on every side. Altogether the day's\r\nmarch had been a miserable four miles. On several occasions, during the\r\nnight, while in this disturbed area, sounds of movement were distinctly\r\nheard; cracks like rifle shots and others similar to distant heavy guns,\r\naccompanied by a weird, moaning noise as of the glacier moving over\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nNovember 18 was a fine, bright day: temperature 8 degrees to 20 degrees\r\nF. Until lunch, the course was mainly north for more than five miles.\r\nThen I went with Watson to trace out a road through a difficult area\r\nin front. At this point, there broke on us a most rugged and wonderful\r\nvision of ice-scenery.\r\n\r\nThe Denman Glacier moving much more rapidly than the Shackleton Shelf,\r\ntore through the latter and, in doing so, shattered both its own sides\r\nand also a considerable area of the larger ice-sheet. At the actual\r\npoint of contact was what might be referred to as gigantic bergschrund:\r\nan enormous chasm over one thousand feet wide and from three hundred\r\nfeet to four hundred feet deep, in the bottom of which crevasses\r\nappeared to go down for ever. The sides were splintered and crumpled,\r\nglittering in the sunlight with a million sparklets of light. Towering\r\nabove were titanic blocks of carven ice. The whole was the wildest,\r\nmaddest and yet the grandest thing imaginable.\r\n\r\nThe turmoil continued to the north, so I resolved to reconnoitre\r\nwestward and see if a passage were visible from the crest of David\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThe excursion was postponed till next day, when Kennedy, Watson and I\r\nroped up and commenced to thread a tangled belt of crevasses. The island\r\nwas three and a half miles from the camp, exposing a bare ridge and a\r\njutting bluff, nine hundred feet high--Watson Bluff. At the Bluff the\r\nrock was almost all gneiss, very much worn by the action of ice. The\r\nface to the summit was so steep and coarsely weathered that we took\r\nrisks in climbing it. Moss and lichens grew luxuriantly and scores of\r\nsnow petrels hovered around, but no eggs were seen.\r\n\r\nOwing to an overcast sky, the view was not a great deal more\r\nenlightening than that which we had had from below. The Denman\r\nGlacier swept down for forty miles from over three thousand feet above\r\nsea-level. For twenty miles to the east torn ice-masses lay distorted in\r\nconfusion, and beyond that, probably sixty miles distant, were several\r\nlarge stretches of bare rock-like islands.\r\n\r\nOn November 20, a strong north-east wind blew, with falling snow.\r\nNothing could be seen but a white blanket, above, below and all around;\r\nso, with sudden death lurking in the bottomless crevasses on every hand,\r\nwe stayed in camp.\r\n\r\nA blizzard of great violence blew for two days and the tent occupied by\r\nKennedy and myself threatened to collapse. We stowed all our gear in the\r\nsleeping-bags or in a hole from which snow had been dug for cooking.\r\nBy the second day we had become extremely tired of lying down. One\r\nconsolation was that our lips, which were very sore from exposure to the\r\nsun and wind, had now a chance of healing.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon, the gale moderated sufficiently for us to go once more\r\nto David Island, in clearer weather, to see the outlook from the bluff.\r\nThis time the sun was shining on the mainland and on the extension of\r\nthe glacier past the bluff to the north. The distant southern slopes\r\nwere seamed with a pattern of crevasses up to a height of three thousand\r\nfeet. To the north, although the way was certainly impassable for twelve\r\nmiles, it appeared to become smoother beyond that limit. We decided to\r\ntry and cross in that direction.\r\n\r\nWe persevered on the 24th over many lines of pressure-ice and then\r\ncamped near an especially rough patch. Watson had the worst fall on that\r\nday, going down ten feet vertically into a crevasse before his harness\r\nstopped him. After supper, we went to locate a trail ahead, and were\r\ngreatly surprised to find salt water in some of the cracks. It meant\r\nthat in two days our descent had been considerable, since the great\r\nbergschrund farther south was well over three hundred feet in depth and\r\nno water had appeared in its depths.\r\n\r\nA few extracts from the diary recall a situation which daily became more\r\nserious and involved:\r\n\r\n\"Monday, November 25. A beautiful day so far as the weather and scenery\r\nare concerned but a very hard one. We have been amongst 'Pressure,' with\r\na capital P, all day, hauling up and lowering the sledges with an alpine\r\nrope and twisting and turning in all directions, with waves and hills,\r\nmonuments, statues, and fairy palaces all around us, from a few feet to\r\nover three hundred feet in height. It is impossible to see more than a\r\nfew hundred yards ahead at any time, so we go on for a bit, then climb a\r\npeak or mound, choose a route and struggle on for another short stage.\r\n\r\n\"We have all suffered from the sun to-day; Kennedy has caught it worst,\r\nhis lips, cheeks, nose and forehead are all blistered. He has auburn\r\nhair and the tender skin which frequently goes with it....\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, November 26. Another very hard day's work. The first half-mile\r\ntook three hours to cover; in several places we had to cut roads with\r\nice-axes and shovels and also to build a bridge across a water-lead. At\r\n1 P.M. we had done just one mile. I never saw or dreamt of anything\r\nso gloriously beautiful as some of the stuff we have come through this\r\nmorning. After lunch the country changed entirely. In place of the\r\nconfused jumble and crush we have had, we got on to neve slopes;\r\nhuge billows, half a mile to a mile from crest to crest, meshed with\r\ncrevasses...\r\n\r\n\"We all had falls into these during the day: Harrisson dropping fifteen\r\nfeet. I received rather a nasty squeeze through falling into a hole\r\nwhilst going downhill, the sledge running on to me before I could get\r\nclear, and pinning me down. So far as we can see, the same kind of\r\ncountry continues, and one cannot help thinking about having to return\r\nthrough this infernal mess. The day's distance--only one thousand and\r\nfifty yards.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, November 27. When I wrote last night about coming back,\r\nI little thought it would be so soon. We turn back to-morrow for the\r\nsimple reason that we cannot go on any farther.\r\n\r\n\"In the morning, for nearly a mile along a valley running south-east,\r\nthe travelling was almost good; then our troubles commenced again.\r\n\r\n\"Several times we had to resort to hand-hauling with the alpine rope\r\nthrough acres of pitfalls. The bridges of those which were covered were\r\ngenerally very rotten, except the wide ones. Just before lunch we had\r\na very stiff uphill pull and then a drop into a large basin,\r\nthree-quarters of a mile in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"The afternoon was spent in vain searching for a road.... On every side\r\nare huge waves split in every direction by crevasses up to two hundred\r\nfeet in width. The general trend of the main crevasses is north and\r\nsouth....\r\n\r\n\"I have, therefore, decided to go back and if possible follow the road\r\nwe came by, then proceed south on to the inland ice-cap and find out the\r\nsource of this chaos. If we are able to get round it and proceed east,\r\nso much the better; but at any rate, we shall be doing something and\r\ngetting somewhere. We could push through farther east from here, but it\r\nwould be by lowering the gear piecemeal into chasms fifty to one hundred\r\nfeet deep, and hauling it up on the other side; each crevasse taking\r\nat least two hours to negotiate. For such slow progress I don't feel\r\njustified in risking the lives of the party.\"\r\n\r\nSnow fell for four days, at times thickly, unaccompanied by wind. It was\r\nuseless to stir in our precarious position. Being a little in hand in\r\nthe ration of biscuits, we fed the dogs on our food, their own having\r\nrun out. I was anxious to keep them alive until we were out of the\r\npressure-ice.\r\n\r\nFrom this, our turning-point out on the shelf-ice, the trail lay over\r\neighteen inches of soft snow on December 3, our former tracks, of\r\ncourse, having been entirely obliterated. The bridged crevasses were now\r\nentirely hidden and many weak lids were found.\r\n\r\nAt 9 A.M. Harrisson, Watson and I roped up to mark a course over a very\r\nbad place, leaving Kennedy with the dogs. We had only gone about one\r\nhundred yards when I got a very heavy jerk on the rope and, on looking\r\nround, found that Watson had disappeared. He weighs two hundred pounds\r\nin his clothes and the crevasse into which he had fallen was fifteen\r\nfeet wide. He had broken through on the far side and the rope, cutting\r\nthrough the bridge, stopped in the middle so that he could not reach the\r\nsides to help himself in any way. Kennedy brought another rope over and\r\nthrew it down to Watson and we were then able to haul him up, but it was\r\ntwenty minutes before he was out. He reappeared smiling, and, except for\r\na bruise on the shin and the loss of a glove, was no worse for the fall.\r\n\r\nAt 2.30 P.M. we were all dead-beat, camping with one mile one thousand\r\nseven hundred yards on the meter. One-third of this distance was relay\r\nwork and, in several places, standing pulls with the alpine rope. The\r\ncourse was a series of Z's, S's, and hairpin turns, the longest straight\r\nstretch one hundred and fifty yards, and the whole knee-deep in soft\r\nsnow, the sledges sinking to the cross-bars.\r\n\r\nThe 4th was a repetition of the previous day--a terribly hard two and\r\na half miles. We all had \"hangman's drops\" into crevasses. One\r\nsnow-bridge, ten feet wide, fell in as the meter following the\r\ntwelve-foot sledge was going over behind it.\r\n\r\nThe 5th was a day of wind, scurrying snow and bad light. Harrisson\r\nwent out to feed the dogs in the morning and broke through the lid of a\r\ncrevasse, but fortunately caught the side and climbed out.\r\n\r\nThe diary again:\r\n\r\n\"Friday, December 6. Still bad light and a little snowfall, but we\r\nwere off at ten o'clock. I was leading and fell into at least a dozen\r\ncrevasses, but had to be hauled out of one only. At 1.30 P.M. we arrived\r\nat the open lead we had crossed on the outward journey and found the\r\nsame place. There had been much movement since then and we had to make\r\na bridge, cutting away projections in some places and filling up the\r\nsea-water channels with snow and ice. Then Harrisson crossed with the\r\naid of two bamboo poles, and hauled me over on a sledge. Harrisson and I\r\non one side and Kennedy and Watson on the other then hauled the sledges\r\nbackwards and forwards, lightly loaded one way and empty the other,\r\nuntil all was across. The shelf-ice is without doubt afloat, if the\r\npresence of sea-water and diatomaceous stains on the ice is of any\r\naccount. We camped to-night in the same place as on the evening of\r\nNovember 25, so with luck we should be out of this mess to-morrow.\r\nSwitzerland had to be killed as I cannot afford any more biscuit.\r\nAmundsen ate his flesh without hesitation, but Zip refused it.\"\r\n\r\nSure enough, two days sufficed to bring us under the bluff on David\r\nIsland. As the tents were being pitched, a skua gull flew down. I snared\r\nhim with a line, using dog's flesh for bait and we had stewed skua for\r\ndinner. It was excellent.\r\n\r\nWhile I was cooking the others climbed up the rocks and brought back\r\neight snow petrels and five eggs, with the news that many more birds\r\nwere nesting. After supper we all went out and secured sixty eggs and\r\nfifty-eight birds. It seemed a fearful crime to kill these beautiful,\r\npure white creatures, but it meant fourteen days' life for the dogs end\r\nlonger marches for us.\r\n\r\nFresh breeze, light snow and a bad light on the 9th; we remained in\r\ncamp. Two more skuas were snared for the evening's dinner. The snow\r\npetrels' eggs were almost as large as hens' eggs and very good to eat\r\nwhen fresh. Many of them had been under the birds rather too long, but\r\nalthough they did not look so nice, there was little difference in the\r\ntaste. I was very glad to get this fresh food, as we had lived on tinned\r\nmeat most of the year and there was always the danger of scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe light was too changeable to make a satisfactory start until the\r\nevening of December 11, when we managed to dodge through four and a\r\nhalf miles of broken ice, reaching the mainland close to our position\r\non November 16, and camping for lunch at midnight. In front was a clear\r\nmile on a peninsula and then the way led across Robinson Bay, seven\r\nmiles wide, fed by the Northcliffe Glacier.\r\n\r\nAnother night march was commenced at 8 P.M. The day had been cloudless\r\nand the sun very warm, softening the surface, but at the time of\r\nstarting it was hardening rapidly. Crossing the peninsula we resolved to\r\nhead across Robinson Bay as the glacier's surface was still torn up. We\r\nended with a fine march of twelve miles one thousand two hundred yards.\r\n\r\nThe fine weather continued and we managed to cross three and a half\r\nmiles of heavy sastrugi, pressure-ridges and crevasses, attaining the\r\nfirst slopes of the mainland at 10 P.M. on December 14. The discovery of\r\ntwo nunataks springing out of the piedmont glacier to the south, lured\r\nus on.\r\n\r\nThe first rock--Possession Nunataks--loomed ahead, two hundred feet\r\nabove, up a slope of half a mile. Here a depot of provisions and spare\r\ngear was made, sufficient to take us back to the Hippo. The rock was\r\nfound by Watson to be gneiss, rich in mica, felspar and garnets. We\r\nlunched in this place and resumed our march at midnight.\r\n\r\nThe second nunatak was on the course; a sharp peak in the south,\r\nhidden by the contour of the uprising ridges. In four miles we steadily\r\nascended eight hundred feet. While we were engaged pitching camp, a Cape\r\npigeon flew overhead.\r\n\r\nThere were advantages in travelling at night. The surface was firmer,\r\nour eyes were relieved from the intense glare and our faces no longer\r\nblistered. On the other hand, there were disadvantages. The skirt of the\r\ntent used to get very wet through the snow thawing on it in the midday\r\nsun, and froze solid when packed up; the floor-cloths and sleeping-bags,\r\nalso, never had a chance of drying and set to the same icy hardness.\r\nWhen we had mounted higher I intended to return to work by day.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the altitude was three thousand feet that we came\r\nin sight of the far peak to the south. We were then pulling again in\r\ndaylight. The ice-falls of the Denman Glacier on the left were still\r\nseen descending from the plateau, while down on the plain we saw that\r\nthe zone of disrupted ice, into which the short and intricate track of\r\nour northern attempt had been won, extended for quite thirty miles.\r\n\r\nThe surface then softened in a most amazing fashion and hauling became\r\na slow, dogged strain with frequent spells. A little over four miles\r\nwas the most we could do on the 18th, and on the 19th the loads were\r\ndragging in a deluge of dry, flour-like snow. A long halt was made at\r\nlunch to repair a badly torn tent.\r\n\r\nThe peak ahead was named Mount Barr-Smith. It was fronted by a steep\r\nrise which we determined to climb next day. On the eastern margin of the\r\nDenman Glacier were several nunataks and higher, rising ground.\r\n\r\nFollowing a twenty-four hours' blizzard, the sky was overcast, with the\r\nusual dim light filtering through a mist of snow. We set off to scale\r\nthe mountain, taking the dip-circle with us. The horizon was so obscured\r\nthat it was useless to take a round of angles. Fifteen miles south of\r\nMount Barr-Smith, and a little higher there was another peak, to be\r\nsubsequently called Mount Strathcona; also several intervening outcrops.\r\nNot a distinct range of mountains as we had hoped. The Denman Glacier\r\nsweeps round these projecting rocks from the south-west, and the general\r\nflow of the ice-sheet is thereby concentrated within the neck bounded by\r\nthe two peaks and the higher land to the east. Propelled by the immense\r\nforces of the hinterland, this stream of ice is squeezed down through\r\na steep valley at an accelerated speed, and, meeting the slower moving\r\nShackleton Shelf, rends it from top to bottom and presses onward. Thus\r\nchaos, icequake, and ruin.\r\n\r\nOur tramp to Mount Barr-Smith was through eighteen inches of soft snow,\r\nin many places a full two feet deep. Hard enough for walking, we knew\r\nfrom experience what it was like for sledging. There was only sufficient\r\nfood for another week and the surface was so abominably heavy that in\r\nthat time, not allowing for blizzards, it would have been impossible to\r\ntravel as far as we could see from the summit of Mount Barr-Smith, while\r\nfour miles a day was the most that could have been done. Our attempt to\r\nmake east by rounding the Denman Glacier to the south had been foiled,\r\nbut by turning back at that point, we stood a chance of saving our two\r\nremaining dogs, who had worked so well that they really deserved to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nSunday December 22 broke with a fresh breeze and surface drift; overhead\r\na clear sky. We went back to Mount Barr-Smith, Kennedy taking an\r\nobservation for latitude, Watson making a geological survey and\r\ncollecting specimens, Harrisson sketching. The rocks at the summit were\r\ngranites, gneisses and schists. The latitude worked out at 67 degrees\r\n10.4' S., and we were a little more than one hundred and twenty miles in\r\nan air-line from the hut.\r\n\r\nIn the next two days, downhill, we \"bullocked\" through eleven miles,\r\nreaching a point where the depot at Possession Nunataks was only sixteen\r\nmiles away. The surface snow was very sticky in places, clogging the\r\nrunners badly, so that they had to be scraped every half-mile. Stewed\r\nskua was the feature of our Christmas Eve supper.\r\n\r\nFrom the diary:\r\n\r\n\"Christmas Day, Wednesday. Turned out and got away at 8 A.M., doing nine\r\nmiles before lunch down a steep descent. The sun was very hot, and after\r\nlunch the surface became sticky, but at 5 P.M. we reached the depot,\r\nhaving done fifteen miles one hundred yards and descended two thousand\r\nthree hundred feet.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I shall have to go back to travelling by night, as the snow\r\nis so very soft down here during the day; not soft in the same way as\r\nthe freshly fallen powdery stuff we had on the hills, but half-thawed\r\nand wet, freezing at night into a splendid surface for the runners.\r\nThe shade temperature at 5.30 P.M. to-day was 29 degrees F., and a\r\nthermometer laid in the sun on the dark rocks went up to 87 degrees F.\r\n\r\n\"Some time ago, a plum-pudding was found in one of our food-bags,\r\nput there, I believe, by Moyes. We ate it to-night in addition to the\r\nordinary ration, and, with a small taste of spirits from the medical\r\nstore, managed to get up quite a festive feeling. After dinner the Union\r\nJack and Australian Ensign were hoisted on the rocks and I formally took\r\npossession of the land in the name of the Expedition, for King George V.\r\nand the Australian Commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nQueen Mary Land is the name which, by gracious sanction, was eventually\r\naffixed to that area of new land.\r\n\r\nNight marches commenced at 1 A.M. on December 27. The sail was hoisted\r\nfor the first time and the fresh breeze was of great assistance. We\r\nwere once more down on the low peninsula and on its highest point, two\r\nhundred feet above the shelf-ice, Kennedy took a round of angles.\r\n\r\nAlong the margin of the shelf the crevasses were innumerable and, as the\r\nsun was hot and the snow soft and mushy, we pitched camp about six miles\r\nfrom the bluff on David Island.\r\n\r\nAt 6 A.M. on the 28th we rounded the bluff and camped under its leeward\r\nface. After lunch there was a hunt for snow petrels. Fifty-six were\r\ncaught and the eggs, which all contained chicks, were given to the dogs.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to touch at all the rocks on the mainland on the way\r\nhome, as time and weather permitted. Under a light easterly breeze we\r\nscudded along with sail set and passed close to several outcrops. Watson\r\nexamined them, finding gneiss and granite principally, one type being\r\nan exceptionally coarse granite, very much weathered. A mile of bad\r\ncrevasses caused some delay; one of the dogs having a fall of twelve\r\nfeet into one abyss.\r\n\r\nNext day, the Hippo hove in sight and we found the depoted food in good\r\ncondition. The course had been over high pressure-waves and in some\r\nplaces we had to diverge on account of crevasses and--fresh water! Many\r\nof the hollows contained water from thawed snow, and in others there was\r\na treacherous crust which hid a slushy pool. The march of eighteen miles\r\nlanded us just north of the Avalanche Rocks.\r\n\r\nWhile we were erecting the tents there were several snow-slips, and\r\nWatson, Kennedy and I walked landwards after supper to try for a \"snap\"\r\nof one in the act of falling, but they refused to oblige us. It was\r\nfound that one or more avalanches had thrown blocks of ice, weighing\r\nat least twenty tons, two hundred yards past the hole in which we spent\r\nfive days on the depot journey. They had, therefore, travelled six\r\nhundred yards from the cliff.\r\n\r\nThe Alligator Nunatak was explored on January 2, 1913. It was found to\r\nbe half a mile long, four hundred feet high and four hundred and fifty\r\nfeet in width, and, like most of the rock we had seen, mainly gneiss.\r\n\r\nThere was half a gale blowing on the 4th and though the wind was abeam,\r\nthe sail was reefed and we moved quickly. The dogs ran loose, their feet\r\nbeing very sore from pulling on rough, nobbly ice. The day's run was the\r\nrecord up to that time--twenty-two miles. Our camp was in the vicinity\r\nof two small nunataks discovered in August 1912. We reckoned to be at\r\nthe Base in two days and wondered how poor Moyes was faring.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 5th, the last piece of broken country fell behind, and one\r\nsledge being rigged with full sail, the second sledge was taken in tow.\r\nBoth dogs had bleeding feet and were released, running alongside. During\r\nthe halt for lunch a sail was raised on the dogs' sledge, using tent\r\npoles as a mast, a floor-cloth for a sail, an ice-axe for an upper\r\nyard and a bamboo for a lower yard. Getting under way we found that the\r\nlighter sledge overran ours; so we cast off and Harrisson took the light\r\nsledge, the sail working so well that he rode on top of the load most\r\nof the time. Later in the afternoon the wind increased so much that the\r\ndogs' sledge was dismasted and taken in tow once more, the sail on the\r\nforward sledge being ample for our purpose.\r\n\r\nAt 4 P.M. we had done twenty miles, and, everybody feeling fresh, I\r\ndecided to try and reach \"The Grottoes,\" fifteen miles away. The wind\r\nincreasing to a gale with hurtling drift, the sail was reefed, and even\r\nthen was more than enough to push along both sledges. Two of us made\r\nfast behind and maintained a continual brake to stop them running away.\r\nAt 9 P.M. the gale became so strong that we struck sail and camped.\r\nAltogether, the day's run was thirty-five miles.\r\n\r\nAn hour's march next morning, and, through the glasses, we saw the mast\r\nand soon afterwards the hut. Just before reaching home, we struck up\r\na song, and in a few seconds Moyes came running out. When he saw there\r\nwere four of us, he stood on his head.\r\n\r\nAs we expected, Moyes had never thought of Harrisson coming with me and\r\nhad quite given him up as dead. When a month had elapsed--the time for\r\nwhich Harrisson had food--Moyes packed a sledge with provisions for\r\nHarrisson, himself and the dogs and went out for six days. Then,\r\nrecognizing the futility of searching for any one in that white waste of\r\nnothingness, he returned. He looked well, after his lonely nine weeks,\r\nbut said that it was the worst time he had ever had in his life. Moyes\r\nreported that the Western party were delayed in starting by bad weather\r\nuntil November 7.\r\n\r\nThe total distance sledged during our main summer eastern journey was\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-seven miles, including thirty-two of relay work,\r\nbut none of the many reconnoitring miles. Out of seventy days, there\r\nwere twenty-eight on which the weather was adverse. On the spring depot\r\njourney the travelling had been so easy that I fully expected to go four\r\nhundred or five hundred miles eastward in the summer. It was therefore,\r\na great disappointment to be blocked as we were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII THE WESTERN BASE--LINKING UP WITH KAISER WILHELM II LAND\r\n\r\nby Dr. S. E. Jones\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our return from the Western Depot journey towards the end of October\r\n1912, we found preparations completed for the long western trip, towards\r\nGaussberg in Kaiser Wilhelm II Land, which was discovered by the German\r\nAntarctic Expedition of 1902. The departure was delayed for several\r\ndays, but came at last on November 7, Moyes bidding us adieu and wishing\r\nus good luck.\r\n\r\nThe party consisted of Dovers (surveyor), Hoadley (geologist), and\r\nmyself (surgeon). We were hauling one sledge with rations for nine\r\nweeks. Our course, which was almost due south lay over the glacier shelf\r\npractically parallel to the sea-cliffs. The surface was good, and we\r\ncovered eleven miles by nightfall, reaching a point some two or three\r\nmiles from the rising land slopes. As the high land was approached\r\ncloser, the surface of the glacier-shelf, which farther north was\r\npractically level, became undulating and broken by pressure-ridges and\r\ncrevasses. These, however, offered no obstacle to sledging.\r\n\r\nProceeding in the morning and finding that an ascent of the slopes ahead\r\nwas rendered impracticable by wide patches of ice, we turned more to\r\nthe west and steered for Junction Corner. Upon our arrival there, it was\r\ndiscovered that several bergs lay frozen within the floe close to where\r\nthe seaward wall of the glacier-shelf joined that of the land ice-sheet.\r\nSome of these bergs were old and rotten, but one seemed to have broken\r\naway quite recently.\r\n\r\nFrom the same place we could see several black points ahead; our course\r\nwas altered towards them, almost due westward, about halt a mile from\r\nthe sea-cliffs. They proved to be rocks, six in number, forming a\r\nmoraine. As it was then half-past five, we camped in order that Hoadley\r\nmight examine them. There had been a halo visible all day, with mock\r\nsuns in the evening.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a high wind was blowing. Everything went well for a\r\nlittle over a mile, when we found ourselves running across a steep\r\nslope. The wind having increased and being abeam, the sledge was driven\r\nto leeward when on a smooth surface, and when amongst soft sastrugi,\r\nwhich occurred in patches, was capsized. Accordingly camp was pitched.\r\n\r\nThe next day being less boisterous, a start was made at 9 A.M. There was\r\nstill a strong beam wind, however, which carried the sledge downhill,\r\nwith the result that for one forward step two had to be taken to the\r\nright. We were more fortunate in the afternoon and reached the depot\r\nlaid on the earlier journey at 5.30 A.M. From this position we had a\r\nfine view of the Helen Glacier running out of a bay which opened up\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nHaving picked up the depot next morning, we were disappointed to find\r\nthat we should have to commence relay work. There were then two sledges\r\nwith rations for thirteen weeks; the total weight amounting to one\r\nthousand two hundred pounds. By making an even division between the two\r\nsledges the work was rendered easy but slow. When we camped at 6 P.M.,\r\nfive and a half miles had been covered. The surface was good, but a\r\nstrong beam wind hindered us while approaching the head of Depot Bay.\r\nThe ice-cap to the west appeared to be very broken, and it seemed\r\ninevitable that we should have to ascend to a considerable altitude\r\ntowards the south-west to find a good travelling surface.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we were delayed by heavy wind, but left camp at ten\r\no'clock after spending an hour digging out the sledges and tent. At\r\nlunch time the sun became quite obscured and each of us had many falls\r\nstumbling over the invisible sastrugi. At five o'clock the weather\r\nbecame so thick that camp was pitched. Hoadley complained of\r\nsnow-blindness and all were suffering with cracked lips; there was\r\nconsequently a big demand for hazeline cream in the evening.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday November 13, we started early, and, finding a good firm\r\ntrack over a gently rising plateau, made fair progress. At three o'clock\r\na gale sprang up suddenly; and fortunately the sledges were only a\r\nquarter of a mile apart as we were relaying them in stages up the rising\r\nplateau. The tent was pitched hurriedly, though with difficulty, on\r\naccount of the high wind and drift. The distance for the day was four\r\nmiles one thousand five hundred yards, the last mile and a half being\r\ndownhill into a valley at the head of the bay. The morainic boulders\r\nvisible from the camp at the depot were now obscured behind a point to\r\nthe west of Depot Bay.\r\n\r\nThe next sixty hours were spent in sleeping-bags, a heavy snowstorm\r\nmaking it impossible to move. Owing to the comparatively high\r\ntemperature, 20 degrees to 26 degrees F., the snow melted readily on\r\nthe lee side of the tent, and, the water running through, things became\r\nuncomfortably wet inside. At midday of the 16th, however, we were able\r\nto go out, and, after spending two and a half hours digging out the tent\r\nand sledges, we made a start, travelling two and three-quarter miles on\r\na south-westerly course.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of the 17th a slight descent was negotiated, but in\r\nthe afternoon came the ascent of the slopes on the western side of Depot\r\nBay. The ice-cap here was very badly crevassed, and spiked boots had to\r\nbe worn in hauling the sledges up the steep neve slopes. In the latter\r\npart of the afternoon a course was made more to the west, and about the\r\nsame time the south-east wind freshened and we travelled for a couple of\r\nhours through thick drift. The night's camp was situated approximately\r\nat the eastern edge of the Helen Glacier. The portion of the ice-cap\r\nwhich contributes to the glacier below is marked off from the general\r\nicy surface on either side by a series of falls and cascades. These\r\nappeared quite impassable near sea-level, but we hoped to find a smooth\r\npassage at an altitude of about one thousand feet.\r\n\r\nA start was made at 7 A.M. The surface consisted of ice and neve and\r\nwas badly broken by pressure-mounds, ten to twenty feet high, and by\r\nnumerous crevasses old and recent; many with sunken or fallen bridges.\r\nWhile crossing a narrow crevasse, about forty feet of the bridge\r\ncollapsed lengthwise under the leading man, letting him fall to the full\r\nextent of his harness rope. Hoadley and myself had passed over the same\r\nspot, unsuspecting and unroped, a few minutes previously, while looking\r\nfor a safe track. We were now nearing the approximate western edge\r\nof the Helen Glacier, and the broken condition of the ice evidently\r\nindicated considerable movement. Later in the morning a more southerly\r\ncourse was kept over an improving surface.\r\n\r\nAt midday Dovers took observations of the sun and found the latitude\r\nto be 66 degrees 47' S. Owing to the heat of the sun the fat in\r\nthe pemmican had been melting in the food-bags, so after lunch the\r\nprovisions were repacked and the pemmican was put in the centre of the\r\nlarge tanks. In the afternoon we hoisted the sail, and by evening had\r\ndone four miles. From our camp the eye could range across the Helen\r\nGlacier eastward to the shelf-ice of \"The Grottoes.\" Far away in the\r\nnorth-west was a wide expanse of open water, while a multitude of bergs\r\nlay scattered along the coast to the west of the Helen Glacier.\r\n\r\nThe next day was gloriously bright, with a breeze just strong enough to\r\nmake hauling pleasant. Erecting a sail, we made an attempt to haul both\r\nsledges, but found that they were too heavy. It was soon discovered that\r\na considerable detour would have to be made to cross the broken ice on\r\nthe western edge of the Helen Glacier. By keeping to the saddles and\r\nvalleys as much as possible and working to the south, we were able to\r\navoid the rougher country, but at 4 P.M. we arrived at what at first\r\nappeared an impasse.\r\n\r\nAt this point three great crevassed ridges united to form the ice-falls\r\non the western side of the glacier. The point of confluence was the only\r\nplace that appeared to offer any hope of a passage, and, as we did not\r\nwant to retrace our steps, we decided to attempt it. The whole surface\r\nwas a network of huge crevasses, some open, the majority from fifty to\r\none hundred feet or more in width. After many devious turns, a patch of\r\nsnow between two large abysses was reached. As the ice in front seemed\r\neven more broken than that behind, camp was pitched. After tea a search\r\nwas made for a way out, and it was found that by travelling along a\r\nnarrow, knife-edge ridge of ice and neve, with an open crevasse on each\r\nside, a good surface could be reached within a mile of the camp. This\r\nridge had a gradient of one in ten, and, unfortunately, also sloped down\r\ntowards one of the open crevasses.\r\n\r\nDuring the next four days a heavy blizzard raged. There was a tremendous\r\nsnowfall accompanied by a gale of wind, and, after the second day, the\r\nsnow was piled four feet high round the tent, completely burying the\r\nsledges and by its pressure greatly reducing the space inside the tent.\r\nOn the 23rd, the fourth day, we dug out the floor, lowering the level\r\nof the tent about two feet, and this made things more comfortable. While\r\ndigging, a crack in the ice was disclosed running across the floor,\r\nand from this came a considerable draught. By midday the weather had\r\nimproved sufficiently to allow us to move.\r\n\r\nThe sledge and tent were excavated from beneath a great mass of soft\r\nsnow; the new level of the snow's surface being four to five feet above\r\nthat on which the camp had been made four days earlier. The wind having\r\nfallen, we went ahead with the sledges. While crossing the ridge of ice\r\nwhich led into the valley below, one man hauled the sledges while the\r\nother two prevented them from sliding sideways downhill into the open\r\ncrevasse. That afternoon we noticed very fine iridescent colouring in\r\ncirro-cumulus clouds as they crossed the sun.\r\n\r\nThe next day gave us a pleasant surprise, there being a strong\r\nbreeze dead aft, while the travelling surface ahead looked distinctly\r\nfavourable. Sail was hoisted and the two sledges were coupled together.\r\nThe course for a short distance was downhill, and we had to run to keep\r\nup with the sledges. The slopes on the far side of the valley we had\r\nentered on the previous afternoon were not so formidable as they had\r\nlooked, for by lunch time six and a half miles had been covered. The\r\nsurface was good, with occasional long undulations. After lunch a turn\r\nto the north was made for a short distance in order to come in touch\r\nwith the coastline. Then the march west was resumed by travelling\r\nparallel to the shore at a distance of five to ten miles. At\r\nhalting-time the extreme western edge of Helen Glacier was passed, and\r\nbelow lay young floe-ice, studded with numerous bergs.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, Dovers called attention to what appeared to be an\r\nice-covered island lying to the north-north-west, thirty to forty miles\r\naway. We watched this carefully during the day, but found its form to\r\nbe constant. Through binoculars, icy patches and bluff points at the\r\neastern and western ends were distinguishable.**\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** This was examined in detail from the 'Aurora' in January 1913 and\r\nfound to be an island, which was named Drygalski Island, for it is\r\nevidently the ice-covered \"high-land\" observed by Professor Drygalski\r\n(German Expedition, 1902) from his balloon.--ED.\r\n\r\nAs soon as camp was struck the march was resumed direct for what every\r\none thought was a rocky outcrop, though nearer approach proved it to\r\nbe merely the shady face of an open crevasse. The same course was\r\nmaintained and the ridge of ice that runs down to the western point of\r\nDepot Bay was soon close at hand. From its crest we could see a group of\r\nabout a dozen rocky islands, the most distant being five miles off the\r\ncoast. All were surrounded by floe. Descending steeply from the ridge\r\ninto a valley which ran out to the sea-cliffs, we pitched camp for\r\nlunch.\r\n\r\nThe meal completed, Hoadley and I descended to the edge of the glacier\r\nin order to see if there were a passable route to the sea-ice. Crossing\r\nwide areas of badly crevassed ice and neve during a descent of nine\r\nhundred feet, we reached the sea-front about one and a half miles\r\nfrom the camp. Below us there was a chaos of bergs and smaller debris,\r\nresulting from the disintegration of the land-ice, which were frozen\r\ninto the floe and connected to one another by huge ramparts of snow.\r\nFollowing a path downward with great difficulty, we approached a small\r\nberg which was discovered to be rapidly thawing under the action of the\r\nheat absorbed by a pile of stones and mud. The trickling of the falling\r\nwater made a pleasant relief in the otherwise intense silence. As it\r\nseemed impossible to haul sledges through this jumble of ice and snow,\r\nHoadley suggested that he should walk across the floe and make a brief\r\ngeological examination of at least the largest islet. I therefore\r\nreturned to the camp and helped Dovers take observations for longitude\r\nand magnetic variation.\r\n\r\nHoadley returned at 9 P.M. and reported that he had seen an immense\r\nrookery of Emperor penguins near the largest islet, besides Adelie\r\npenguins, silver-grey, Wilson and Antarctic petrels and skua gulls. He\r\nalso said that he thought it possible to take a sledge, lightly laden,\r\nthrough the drifts below the brink of the glacier.\r\n\r\nAccordingly in the morning the eleven-foot sledge was packed with\r\nnecessaries for a week's stay, although we intended to remain only for\r\na day in order to take photographs and search for specimens. Erecting\r\na depot flag to mark the big sledge, we broke camp at midday and soon\r\nreached the sea-front. Our track then wound among the snow-drifts until\r\nit emerged from the broken ice which was observed to border the land\r\nice-sheet for miles. The travelling became unexpectedly good for a time\r\nover highly polished, green sea-ice, and thence on to snow, amid a\r\nfield of numerous small bergs. Many of these showed a marked degree\r\nof ablation, and, in places, blocks of ice perched on eminences had\r\nweathered into most grotesque forms. There were numerous streams of\r\nthaw-water running from mud-covered bergs. Perspiring in the heat, we\r\nmore than once stopped to slake our thirst.\r\n\r\nApproaching the largest rock--Haswell Island, as it was called later--we\r\nsaw more distinctly the immense numbers of Emperor penguins covering\r\nseveral acres of floe. The birds extended in rows even on to the lower\r\nslopes of several bergs. The sound of their cries coming across the\r\nice reminded one of the noise from a distant sports' ground during a\r\nwell-contested game. We camped at 5 P.M. on a snow-drift at the southern\r\nend of the island. A large rookery of Adelie penguins on a long, low\r\nrock, about a mile distant, soon made itself evident.\r\n\r\nAlthough the stay was intended to occupy only about twenty-four hours,\r\nwe were compelled to remain five days on the island on account of a\r\nsnowstorm which continued for practically the whole of the time. This\r\ndid not prevent us from leaving the tent and wandering about; Hoadley\r\nkeen on the geology and Dovers surveying whenever the light was good\r\nenough. The temperature of the rock was well above freezing-point\r\nwhere it was exposed, and snow melted almost as soon as it fell. Our\r\nsleeping-bags and gear soon became very wet, but we rejoiced in one\r\ncompensation, and that was a change in diet. It was agreed that five\r\nAdelie penguins or ten Cape pigeons' eggs made a good tasty entree to\r\nthe monotonous ration.\r\n\r\nThe camp was situated on the largest of a group of about twelve small\r\nislets, lying within five or six miles of the coast, on the lower slopes\r\nof which several outcrops of rock could be observed. Haswell Island was\r\nfound to be roughly diamond-shaped; three-quarters of a mile in length,\r\nthe same in width, and about three hundred feet on the highest point.\r\nIt was surrounded by one season's floe, raised in pressure-ridges on\r\nthe eastern side. On the northern, southern, and especially the eastern\r\nface, the rock was steep; on the western aspect, there was a more\r\ngentle slope down to the floe, the rock being almost concealed by big\r\nsnow-drifts. There were signs of previous glaciation in the form of\r\nerratics and many examples of polishing and grooving. The rock was very\r\nrotten, and in many places, especially about the penguin rookeries,\r\nthere were collections of soil. Two deep gorges cut through the island\r\nfrom north-west to south-east, in both of which there were small ponds\r\nof fresh water.\r\n\r\nThe most marked feature was the wonderful abundance of bird life, for\r\nalmost all the birds frequenting the shores of the continent were found\r\nnesting there. Adelie penguins were in greatest numbers. Besides\r\nthe large rookery on one of the smaller islets, there were numerous\r\nrookeries of fifty to one hundred birds each on Haswell Island. In most\r\ncases the penguins made their nests on the rock itself, but, failing\r\nthis, had actually settled on snow-drifts, where they presented a\r\npeculiar sight, as the heat of their bodies having caused them to sink\r\nin the snow, their heads alone were visible above the surface. One bird\r\nwas observed carrying an egg on the dorsal surface of his feet as the\r\nEmperor penguins do. Feathers were scattered broadcast around each\r\nrookery. These result from the numerous fights which occur and are also\r\npartly derived from the bare patch of skin at the lower part of the\r\nabdomen which provides the necessary heat for incubation when the bird\r\nis sitting. Most of the birds had two eggs in a well-advanced stage\r\nof incubation, and it was a difficult task to find a sufficient number\r\nfresh enough for culinary purposes. Attached to each rookery was a pair\r\nof skua gulls, who swooped down and quickly flew off with any eggs left\r\nfor a moment untended.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor penguins had their rookery on the floe, about a mile\r\nfrom the island. The birds covered four to five acres, but there were\r\nundoubted signs that a much larger area had been occupied. We estimated\r\nthe numbers to be seven thousand five hundred, the great majority being\r\nyoung birds. These were well grown, most of them standing as high as the\r\nshoulders of the adults. They were all very fat, covered by a grey down,\r\nslightly darker on the dorsal than on the ventral surface, with dark\r\ntails and a black, straight beak. The eyes were surrounded by a ring\r\nof grey plumage, and this again by a black band which extended over the\r\nskull to the root of the beak. Thus the markings on the young do not\r\ncorrespond with those of the adults. A few of the larger chicks\r\nhad commenced to moult, the change of plumage being observed on the\r\nflippers.\r\n\r\nDaily we watched large numbers of adults departing from and returning\r\nto the rookery. The direction in which they travelled was north, towards\r\nopen water, estimated to be twenty miles distant. Although more than\r\nonce the adults' return to the rookery was carefully noted, we never saw\r\nthe young birds being fed, old birds as they entered the rookery quietly\r\ngoing to sleep.\r\n\r\nHoadley, on his first visit to the island, had seen Antarctic petrels\r\nflying about, and a search revealed a large rookery of these on the\r\neastern side. The nesting-place of this species of petrel had never\r\nbefore been discovered, and so we were all elated at the great find.\r\nAbout three hundred birds were found sitting in the gullies and clefts,\r\nas close together as they could crowd. They made no attempt to form\r\nnests, merely laying their eggs on the shallow dirt. Each bird had one\r\negg about the same size as that of a domestic fowl. Incubation was far\r\nadvanced, and some difficulty was experienced in blowing the specimens\r\nwith a blow-pipe improvised from a quill. Neither the Antarctic nor\r\nany other petrels offered any resistance when disturbed on their nests,\r\nexcept by the expectoration of large quantities of a pink or green, oily\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nThe Cape pigeons had just commenced laying when we arrived at the\r\nisland. On the first day only two eggs were found, but, on the fourth\r\nday after our arrival, forty were collected. These birds make a small\r\nshallow nest with chips of stone.\r\n\r\nThe silver-grey or Southern Fulmar petrels were present in large\r\nnumbers, especially about the steep north-eastern side of the island.\r\nThough they were mated, laying had scarcely commenced, as we found only\r\ntwo eggs. They made small grottoes in the snow-drifts, and many pairs\r\nwere seen billing and cooing in such shelters.\r\n\r\nThe small Wilson petrels were found living in communities under slabs\r\nof rock, and Hoadley one afternoon thought he heard some young birds\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\nSkua gulls were present in considerable force, notably near the penguin\r\nrookeries. They were breeding at the time, laying their eggs on the soil\r\nnear the summit of the island. The neighbourhood of a nest was always\r\nbetrayed by the behaviour of these birds who, when we intruded on them,\r\ncame swooping down as if to attack us.\r\n\r\nAlthough many snow petrels were seen flying about, we found only one\r\nwith an egg. The nests were located in independent rocky niches but\r\nnever in rookeries.\r\n\r\nVegetable life existed in the form of algae, in the pools, lichens on\r\noversell rocks and mosses which grew luxuriantly, chiefly in the Adelie\r\npenguin rookeries.\r\n\r\nWeddell seals were plentiful about the island near the tide-cracks; two\r\nof them with calves.\r\n\r\nThough the continuous bad weather made photography impossible, Hoadley\r\nwas able to make a thorough geological examination of the locality. On\r\nDecember 2 the clouds cleared sufficiently for photography, and after\r\nsecuring some snapshots we prepared to move on the next day. Dovers\r\nbuilt a small cairn on the summit of the island and took angles to the\r\noutlying rocks.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd we packed our specimens and left for the mainland at 9.30\r\nA.M., arriving at the land ice-cliffs at 2 P.M. The snow surface was\r\nsoft, even slushy in places, and the heat amongst the bergs along the\r\ncoast of the mainland was very oppressive. After we had dug out the\r\nsecond sledge and re-arranged the loads, the hour was too late for\r\nsledging, so Dovers took another observation in order to obtain the rate\r\nof the half-chronometer watch. While on the island, we had examined the\r\ncoast to the west with glasses and concluded that the only way to get\r\nwestward was to ascend to a considerable altitude on the ice-cap,\r\nwhich, as far as the eye could reach, descended to the sea-level in\r\nlong cascades and falls. We had expected to place a depot somewhere near\r\nHaswell Island, but such procedure was now deemed inadvisable in view of\r\nits distance from what would probably be our direct return route.\r\n\r\nA start was made next day against an opposing wind, the sledges being\r\nrelayed up a steep hillside. Later on, however, a turn was made more\r\nto the west, and it was then possible to haul both sledges at the same\r\ntime. The surface was soft, so that after every halt the runners had to\r\nbe cleared. The distance for the day was five and a half miles, and the\r\nnight's camp was at an altitude of about one thousand five hundred feet,\r\nlocated just above the broken coastal ice.\r\n\r\nDuring December 5 and 6 a snowstorm raged and confined us to our tent.\r\nThe high temperature caused the falling snow to melt as it touched the\r\ntent, and, when the temperature fell, the cloth became thickly coated\r\nwith ice.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th the march was resumed, by skirting a small valley at an\r\napproximate altitude of two thousand feet. The ice-cap ahead descended\r\nin abrupt falls to the floe. Having a fair wind and a smooth surface, we\r\nmade good headway. In the afternoon we ran into a plexus of crevasses,\r\nand the surface was traversed by high ridges. The snowbridges in many\r\ncases were weak and several gave way while the sledge was crossing them.\r\nA chasm about fifty feet deep and one hundred feet long was passed,\r\nevidently portion of a crevasse, one side of which had been raised.\r\nLater in the afternoon the surface became impassable and a detour to the\r\nsouth was rendered necessary. This difficulty arose near the head of the\r\nvalley, in which situation the ice-cap fell in a series of precipitous\r\nterraces for about one thousand feet.\r\n\r\nAt midday on the 8th we were compelled to continue the detour over a\r\nbadly crevassed surface, ascending most of the time. On that night, camp\r\nwas pitched again amongst crevasses. The sledge-meter showed only two\r\nmiles one thousand one hundred yards for the afternoon, relaying having\r\nbeen necessary.\r\n\r\nThe sledges slipped along in the morning with a fresh breeze in their\r\nfavour. The sky was covered with rapidly scudding, cirro-cumulus clouds\r\nwhich, by midday, quite obscured the sun, making surrounding objects and\r\neven the snow at our feet indistinguishable. After continuing for four\r\nand a half miles, we were forced to camp. In the afternoon a heavy\r\nsnowstorm commenced and persisted throughout the following day.\r\n\r\nThough snow was still falling on the morning of the 11th, camp was\r\nbroken at 10 A.M., and we moved off rapidly with a strong wind. During\r\nthe morning the surface was gently undulating, but it mounted in a\r\ngradual ascent until nightfall. In the latter part of the afternoon\r\nthe sun was clouded over, and steering had to be done by the aid of\r\nthe wind. To the north we had a fine view of Drygalski's \"High\r\nLand\" (Drygalski Island), perceiving a distinct seaward ice-cliff of\r\nconsiderable height.\r\n\r\nAs there were no prominences on the ice-cap that could be used for\r\nsurveying marks, Dovers had considerable difficulty in keeping\r\na reckoning of our course. The trouble was overcome by building\r\nsnow-mounds and taking back-angles to them with the prismatic compass.\r\nAt this juncture we were about ten miles from the shore and could see\r\nopen water some thirty miles to the north. Frozen fast within the floe\r\nwere great numbers of bergs.\r\n\r\nWe started off early on December 12 with the aid of a fair breeze over\r\na good surface, so that both sledges were easily hauled along together.\r\nThe course was almost due west, parallel to the coast. Open water came\r\nwithin a few miles of the ice-cliffs, and, farther north, a heavy belt\r\nof pack was observed. When the sun sank lower, the bergs on the northern\r\nhorizon were refracted up to such a degree that they appeared to be\r\nhanging from the sky.\r\n\r\nThe aid rendered by the sail under the influence of a fair breeze was\r\nwell shown on the following day. In four hours, on a good surface, both\r\nsledges were transported seven miles. When we moved off, the wind was\r\nblowing at ten to fifteen miles an hour. By 10 A.M. the sky became\r\novercast and the wind freshened. Camp was pitched for lunch at 11 A.M.,\r\nas we hoped that the weather would clear again later, but the wind\r\nincreased and snow began to fall heavily in the afternoon, so we did\r\nnot stir. The storm continued throughout the following day and it was\r\nimpossible to march until the 15th.\r\n\r\nContinuing the ascent on the 16th out of a valley we had crossed on\r\nthe previous day, we halted on the top of a ridge within view of German\r\n\"territory\"--a small, dark object bearing due west, evidently bare rock\r\nand presumably Gaussberg. The course was altered accordingly towards\r\nthis object and everything went smoothly for ten miles. Then followed\r\nan area where the ice fell steeply in waves to the sea, crossed by\r\ncrevasses which averaged fifty feet in width. The snow-bridges were\r\ndeeply concave, and the lower side of each chasm was raised into a ridge\r\nfive to ten feet high. Making fast the alpine rope on to the sledges,\r\none of us went ahead to test the bridge, and then the sledges, one at a\r\ntime, were rushed down into the trough and up on the other side. After\r\ncrossing ten or more crevasses in this fashion, we were forced to camp\r\nby the approach of a rapidly moving fog driven before a strong westerly\r\nwind. While camp was being prepared, it was discovered that a tin of\r\nkerosene on the front sledge had been punctured causing the loss of a\r\ngallon of fuel. Fortunately, we were well within our allowance, so the\r\naccident was not serious. Soon after tea our attention was drawn to a\r\npattering on the tent like rain, caused by a fall of sago snow.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the weather was clearer, and we saw that it was\r\nimpossible to reach Gaussberg by a direct route. The ice ahead was cleft\r\nand split in all directions, and, in places, vertical faces stood up\r\nto a height of one hundred feet. The floe was littered with hundreds of\r\nbergs, and in several localities there were black spots which resembled\r\nsmall rocks, but it was impossible to approach close enough to be\r\ncertain. Retracing the way out of the broken ice, we steered in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction, just above the line of serac and crevassed\r\nice. The coast here trended to the south-west, forming the eastern side\r\nof Drygalski's Posadowsky Bay. The going was heavy, the surface being\r\ncovered by a layer of frost-crystals deposited during the night. A fog\r\ncame up again early in the afternoon and had quite surrounded us at\r\ncamping time. During the day there were fine clouds of ice-crystals in\r\nthe air, and at 8 P.M. a fog-bow was seen in the east.\r\n\r\nTurning out in the morning we saw Gaussberg peeping over a ridge to the\r\nwest, but were still prevented from steering directly towards it by the\r\nbroken surface. When we had advanced ten miles, a heavy fog brought us\r\nto a halt at 5 P.M.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the 20th, in spite of a sticky surface, thirteen miles\r\nwas covered on a west-south-west course. The ice-cap continued to be\r\nundulating but free of crevasses. The altitude was between two thousand\r\nfive hundred and three thousand feet.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, after travelling two miles, we came in sight of\r\nGaussberg again and steered directly towards it. The surface was good\r\nwith a downward grade. At five and a quarter miles a depot was made of\r\nthe small sledge and most of the food, in expectation of a clear run\r\nto the mountain. Not far ahead, however, were two broken-backed ridges\r\nintersecting the course, and a detour had to be made to the south to\r\ncross them higher up.\r\n\r\nMidsummer's day, December 22, was spent in the tent, a move being\r\nimpossible on account of the high wind. In the afternoon we walked ahead\r\na short distance and reconnoitred six or seven crumpled ridges. Though\r\nthe barometer had been falling ominously for twenty-four hours, the bad\r\nweather did not continue.\r\n\r\nGaussberg was reached in the afternoon, after our track had passed\r\nthrough seventeen miles of dangerous country. For the first few miles\r\nthe surface consisted of a series of steep, buckled ice-ridges; later,\r\nit was snow-covered, but at times literally cut into a network of\r\ncrevasses.\r\n\r\nThe only approach to Gaussberg from the plateau is from the south. To\r\nthe east and west there are magnificent ice-falls, the debris from which\r\nlitters the floe for miles around.\r\n\r\nDecember 24 and Christmas Day were devoted to examining the mountain.\r\nDovers made a long series of observations for longitude, latitude\r\nand magnetic variation, while Hoadley examined the rocks and took\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\nOn the southern side, the ice-cap abuts against this extinct volcano at\r\nan elevation of about four hundred feet above sea-level; the summit of\r\nthe mountain rises another eight hundred feet. On the north, the rock\r\ndescends to the floe. Gaussberg is pyramidal in shape, falling steeply,\r\nfrom a ridge at the summit. The sides are covered with a loose rubble\r\nof volcanic fragments, square yards of which commence to slide at the\r\nslightest disturbance. This renders climbing difficult and accounts for\r\nthe large numbers of isolated blocks fringing the base.\r\n\r\nAt the summit two cairns were found, the bamboo poles which had\r\npreviously marked them having blown over. Further examination revealed\r\nmany other bamboos which had been used as marks, but no other record of\r\nthe visit of the German expedition, ten years before, was met. Bird life\r\nwas not plentiful, being limited to a few skuas, Wilson petrels and\r\nsnow petrels; the latter nesting under slabs of rock. There were large\r\nquantities of moss where thaw-water had been running.\r\n\r\nThe ice and snow near the mountain showed evidences of marked thawing,\r\nand we had difficulty in finding a favourable spot for our camp.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day was gloriously fine, with just sufficient wind to\r\ncounteract the heat of the sun. At midday the Christmas \"hamper\" was\r\nopened, and it was not long before the only sign of the plum-pudding was\r\nthe tin. In the afternoon we ascended the mountain and left a record in\r\na cairn at the top. By the route followed, Gaussberg was two hundred\r\nand fifteen miles from \"The Grottoes\" but relay work had made the actual\r\ndistance covered three hundred miles.\r\n\r\nWe had been away from home seven weeks, and, though there was sufficient\r\nfood for an outward journey of another week, there was no indication\r\nthat the country would change. Further, from the summit of Gaussberg one\r\ncould see almost as far as could be marched in a week. Accordingly it\r\nwas decided to commence our return on the 26th, making a course almost\r\ndue east, thus cutting out numerous detours which had to be taken on the\r\noutward journey.\r\n\r\nWe left the mountain on December 26, pursuing a course to the south\r\nof our outward track so as to avoid some crevassed ridges. Ascending\r\nsteadily against a continuous headwind, we picked up the second sledge\r\nat midday on the 28th.\r\n\r\nNext day all the gear was transferred to one sledge and a course made\r\ndirect to the Helen Glacier; the other sledge being abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn December 31, after a day's blizzard, the surface was found to be\r\ncovered with sastrugi of soft snow eighteen inches to two feet in depth.\r\nIn crossing a wide crevasse, the sledge became bogged in the soft snow\r\nof a drift which had a deceptive appearance of solidity. It took us\r\nten minutes to extricate ourselves, and, after this, crevasses were\r\nnegotiated at a run.\r\n\r\nA violent blizzard raged during the following day--the first of the New\r\nYear 1913. This proved to be a blessing, for it made the surface more\r\ncrisp and firm. In the morning the sun was obscured and nothing was\r\nvisible but the snow at our feet, so that steering was very difficult.\r\nIn the afternoon the sun broke through, a strong westerly wind sprang\r\nup and we moved along at a good pace, covering more than thirteen miles\r\nbefore camping.\r\n\r\nOn January 3 the track bordered on the edge of the plateau, the surface\r\nbeing almost level, rising gently towards the south.\r\n\r\nAfter a violent blizzard of three days' duration, which confined us in\r\nthe tent, we continued on the same course for four days, averaging about\r\neleven miles each day. The surface was good, but a strong south-easter\r\nblew practically all the time and reduced our speed considerably.\r\n\r\nAt 10 A.M. on January 9, a fog-bank was observed in the east. This\r\nrapidly approached, and in fifteen minutes was quite close. There was\r\nnow a splendid display of rings and arcs, caused apparently by minute\r\nice-crystals which filled the air without obscuring the sun or sky.\r\nFirst an arc of prismatic colours appeared in the east, and in a few\r\nseconds the sky seemed literally to be covered with other arcs. At first\r\nthey seemed to be scattered indiscriminately, but after a short time\r\nseveral arcs joined and we could discern a symmetrical arrangement. The\r\nsun was surrounded by a ring, the lower portion of which was broken by\r\nan inverted arc; two other arcs were visible on either side. A large\r\nring appeared encircling the zenith, intersecting the first and passing\r\nthrough the sun. Two pairs of arcs were also seen, one pair in\r\neach ring. Excepting the arcs and ring about the zenith, which was\r\ngrayish-white against the blue sky, the arcs showed prismatic colouring.\r\nThe display lasted ten minutes and ended with the disappearance of the\r\nice-crystals.\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION IN TEXT]\r\n\r\nThe diagram shows the arrangement of the arcs:\r\n\r\nS = Sun. Z = Zenith.\r\n\r\nAt A, B, C, mock suns could be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom our camp on the night of January 10, broken country could be seen\r\nahead. To the north, open water was visible, and to the north-east the\r\nShackleton Shelf, so that we were nearing home at last. Here, a heavy\r\nsnowstorm delayed us for two and a half days, and it was not till the\r\nafternoon of January 13 that we were able to move ahead.\r\n\r\nThe next day was dull, the sun being quite obscured; and the only check\r\nupon the steering was the south-easterly wind. At midday the thermometer\r\nregistered 35 degrees F. in the shade, and the surface became quite\r\nsticky. After tea we walked ahead for a couple of hundred yards to the\r\nsummit of a ridge where the full extent of the Helen Glacier was laid\r\nbefore us. It was evident that our position was some miles north of\r\nthe true course, but, considering the absence of steering marks and the\r\nconstant overcast weather, we considered ourselves lucky in being so\r\nclose to it.\r\n\r\nThe bad weather continued and snow fell during the following day. On\r\nthe 16th the light was better, and we pushed into a strong wind which\r\nfreshened to the force of a moderate gale before we had travelled two\r\nmiles. Approaching a steep ascent we were compelled to camp. The morning\r\nbrought an improvement, and the crossing of the Helen Glacier was\r\ncommenced a mile or two above the outward course.\r\n\r\nAt midday on January 18, over treacherous ice, in the face of strong\r\nwinds, we were making good headway towards Junction Corner. Almost daily\r\nfor a fortnight a Wilson petrel had visited us, the only form of life\r\nseen on the return journey.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th we were not able to move until 8.80 P.M., when the wind,\r\nwhich had been blowing with the force of a gale, subsided. During the\r\nafternoon a magnificent view of the Helen Glacier was obtained, and in\r\nthe west we could see Haswell Island and Drygalski Island.\r\n\r\nContinuing on the same course, throughout the following day, we picked\r\nup the hut with the binoculars at 5 P.M. There now came a quick descent\r\nto Junction Corner.\r\n\r\nOn the lower levels there was clear evidence of thawing having occurred.\r\nThe firm surface of snow which had been present on the outward journey\r\nwas now converted into rough ice, over which we walked painfully in\r\nfinnesko. Neve and ice surfaces were covered with sharp spicules, and\r\nthe sides and bridges of crevasses were unmistakably thawed.\r\n\r\nLeaving Junction Corner at 6 A.M., we steered a course for the hut,\r\nrunning parallel to the edge of the glacier. At 3 P.M. the mast was\r\nsighted, and, later, the hut itself. When within half a mile of \"The\r\nGrottoes\" we saw three figures on the floe and guessed that the eastern\r\nparty had returned. In a few minutes greetings were heartily exchanged\r\nand they had welcomed us home.\r\n\r\nInstructions had been given that the Western Base should be in readiness\r\nto embark on the 'Aurora' not later than January 30, 1913.\r\n\r\nWhen Wild's party had arrived, preparations for departure were\r\nimmediately made. Geological and biological collections were packed,\r\nstores were sorted out and cases containing personal gear were sledged\r\nto the edge of the glacier.\r\n\r\nHarrisson contrived a winch for sounding and fishing. Fourteen-gauge\r\ncopper wire was wound on it and, through a crack in the sea-ice a\r\nquarter of a mile from the glacier, bottom was reached in two hundred\r\nand sixty fathoms. As the water was too deep for dredging, Harrisson\r\nmanufactured cage-traps and secured some fish, a squid, and other\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nAt this time there was abundant evidence of life. Skua gulls frequently\r\nflew about the hut, as well as Cape pigeons, Antarctic, snow, Wilson,\r\ngiant and silver-grey petrels. Out on the sea-ice, there were Adelie and\r\nEmperor penguins; the latter moulting. Hundreds of seals were seen with\r\nglasses on the edge of the floe, ten miles to the north.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, January was a very fine month. Some of the days seemed\r\nreally hot; the shade temperature on one occasion reaching 37 degrees\r\nF., and, in several instances, 33 degrees F. It was quite a common\r\nthing for a man to work outside in loose, light garments; in fact, with\r\nnothing more than a singlet on the upper part of the body.\r\n\r\nOn January 26, while Kennedy took observations, Wild and the others went\r\nfor a walk towards the open water. The surface was very rough and broken\r\nby leads, along which Weddell seals lay in great numbers. Three miles\r\nof ice were found to have drifted out, reducing the northern expanse to\r\nseven miles.\r\n\r\nIn view of the possibility of the 'Aurora' not relieving them, the party\r\nwent through their food-supplies, finding that these were sufficient for\r\nanother year, with the exception of meat. With regard to coal, two tons\r\nof briquettes remained, which, augmented by good stock of seal-blubber,\r\nwould provide sufficient fuel.\r\n\r\nLaying in a store of seals' flesh and blubber now became the principal\r\nwork, and every fine day saw a party out with a sledge. Unfortunately,\r\nthe nearest crack on the sea-ice was nearly two miles away, so that the\r\nreturn journey, with a heavily laden sledge, was long and tedious. Two\r\nholes were dug in the glacier near the hut, one for blubber and the\r\nother for meat.\r\n\r\nOn January 31 six miles of sea-ice still remained, and, if the ship had\r\narrived to time, a good deal of sledging would have been required to\r\ntransport all the gear aboard.\r\n\r\nIn February, the weather altered for the worse, and there was not\r\na single fine day until the 20th. A strong east-southeast wind with\r\nfalling snow prevailed. As the days were shortening rapidly, all were\r\nbeginning to feel anxious about the 'Aurora'.\r\n\r\nWild erected a flagstaff on the highest ice-pinnacle near \"The Grottoes\"\r\nand flew a large flag on it whenever the wind moderated. On the 16th, a\r\nlamp-screen and reflector were fitted at the mast-head and each night\r\na hurricane lamp was placed there, which could be seen eight miles with\r\nthe naked eye.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th Dovers and Wild made a large signboard, taking it out to a\r\nprominent point on the glacier, three and a half miles to the north. It\r\nwas lashed to a bamboo pole with a flag flying on it. The open water was\r\nthen only three miles distant.\r\n\r\nWild writes:\r\n\r\n\"The 22nd February was the anniversary of the day the 'Aurora' left us,\r\nbut the weather was very different. A heavy blizzard was raging, the\r\nwind's velocity ranging up to eighty miles per hour. As it was Saturday,\r\nwe kept the usual routine, scrubbing out and cleaning up the hut. We\r\ncould not help speculating as to whether we should have to do it for\r\nanother whole year. But every one had great faith in 'good old Davis,'\r\nand nobody was at all downhearted.\r\n\r\n\"When we 'turned out' on Sunday there was still a strong wind and drift,\r\nbut this died away to a light breeze before breakfast was over, and the\r\nsun came out. I had a look round with the glasses and saw that the ice\r\nhad broken away beyond a limit of one and a half miles. As there was a\r\nsledge, which Harrisson had been using for sounding, within a few yards\r\nof the water's edge, Jones and I went off to bring it in. We had\r\ngone less than half a mile when we saw what at first appeared to be a\r\npenguin, standing on some pack-ice in the distance, but which we soon\r\nsaw was the mast-head of the 'Aurora'.\r\n\r\n\"It was evident that she could not be alongside for some time, so Jones\r\nwent back to the hut to tell the others to bring down a load of gear,\r\nand I went on to meet the ship. Before the 'Aurora' had reached the fast\r\nice, all the party were down with two sledge loads, having covered the\r\nmile and a half in record time.\r\n\r\n\"We were all anxious, of course, for news, and the first we received was\r\nthe sad account of the deaths of Ninnis and Mertz; then of the wonderful\r\nmarch made by Dr. Mawson.\r\n\r\n\"Before closing, I should like to pay a tribute to the good-fellowship,\r\nunfailing industry, enthusiasm and unswerving loyalty which\r\ncharacterized my comrades. During the whole of the Expedition, whether\r\ncarrying out monotonous routine work at the Base or under the trying\r\nconditions of sledging, all duties were performed with never-failing\r\ngood temper and perseverance.\r\n\r\n\"Should it ever be my lot to venture on a like expedition I hope to have\r\nsome, if not all, of the same party with me. But whether we meet again\r\nor not, I shall always think of every man of them with the greatest\r\naffection and respect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII A SECOND WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first busy year in Adelie Land, when the Hut was full of\r\nlife and work, there were few moments for reflection. Yet, over the\r\nspeculative pipe at home after a successful day's labour on the wireless\r\nmasts, or out on the turbulent plateau when the hour of hoosh brought\r\nthe strenuous day to a close, more than one man was heard to say, \"One\r\nyear in this country is enough for me.\" Still, in the early days, no one\r\ncould predict what would happen, and therefore a change in the perverse\r\nclimate was always considered probable. So great was the emulation, and\r\nso keen were all to extend our geographical boundaries, that the year\r\nsped away almost before the meagre opportunity came. With the cheery\r\nsupport of numbers, we did not find it a difficult matter \"to drive dull\r\ncare away.\"\r\n\r\nNow there were only seven of us; we knew what was ahead; the weather had\r\nalready given ample proof of the early approach of winter; the field of\r\nwork which once stretched to the west, east and south had no longer the\r\nmystery of the \"unknown\"; the Ship had gone and there was scant hope of\r\nrelief in March.\r\n\r\nAgainst all this. There remained the Hut--a proven shelter from the\r\nwind; and, most vital of all, there was abundant food for another year.\r\nEvery avenue of scientific work was not yet closed. Even the routine of\r\nmeteorological and magnetic work was adding in no slight degree to\r\nthe sum of human knowledge. Our short mile of rocks still held some\r\ngeological secrets, and there were biological discoveries yet to make. A\r\nwireless telegraphic station had at last been established, and we could\r\nconfidently expect communication with the outside world at an early\r\ndate. These were some of the obvious assurances which no one had\r\nthe heart to think about at first; and then there was always our\r\ncomradeship, most enduring of all.\r\n\r\nFebruary, during 1912, was a tolerable month with a fair proportion of\r\nsunny, moderately calm days. A year later, the first eight days of this\r\nmonth were signalized by the blizzard in which the 'Aurora' had such a\r\nperilous experience. While the winter began in 1912 with the advent of\r\nMarch, now in 1913 it came on definitely in early February. Autumn was\r\na term which applied to a few brilliant days which would suddenly\r\nintervene in the dense rack of drift-snow.\r\n\r\nWe set to work to make the Hut, if anything, safer and snugger. Bage put\r\nfinishing touches to the break-wind of rock and cases, and with Hodgeman\r\nand McLean nailed battens of wood over a large sheet of canvas which had\r\nbeen stretched across the windward side of the roof, overlapping rolls\r\nof black paper, scraps of canvas and bagging, which were also battened\r\ndown to make the eastern and western faces more air-tight.\r\n\r\nBefore the Ship left us, the remaining coal briquettes had been dug out\r\nof a bed of ice and carefully piled on a high point of the rocks. Round\r\nthem all the spare timber and broken cases were gathered to provide\r\nsufficient fuel for the ensuing winter. The penguins' eggs, which had\r\nbeen stored in boxes, were stacked together on the windward side of the\r\nHut, and a choice selection of steaks of seal and penguin for our own\r\nuse were at the storeman's disposal in the veranda.\r\n\r\nMadigan, in addition to his meteorological duties, took charge of the\r\nnew sledging-dogs which had been presented by Captain Amundsen. A good\r\nmany seals had been already killed, and a big cache of meat and blubber\r\nwas made alongside the Hut to last throughout the winter.\r\n\r\nBickerton found many odd jobs to occupy his time in connexion with the\r\npetrol-engine and the wireless installations. He was also busied with\r\nthe anemometer, which had broken down and needed a strong start for its\r\nsecond year of usefulness.\r\n\r\nBage, following the parting instructions of Webb, became the owner of\r\nthe Magnetograph House and the Absolute Hut, continuing to keep the\r\nmagnetic records. As storeman, Bage looked after the food-supplies. The\r\ncanvas coverings had made the veranda drift-tight, so the storeman could\r\narrange his tins and cases on the shelves with some degree of comfort,\r\nand the daily task of shovelling out snow was now at an end. Further,\r\nHodgeman and he built an annex out of spare timber to connect the\r\nentrance veranda with the store. This replaced the old snow-tunnel\r\nwhich had melted away, and, when completed and padded outside with old\r\nmattresses, was facetiously styled the \"North-West Passage.\" The only\r\nthing which later arose to disturb the composure of the storeman was\r\nthe admission of the dogs to a compartment in the veranda on the eastern\r\nside. His constant care then became a heap of mutton carcases which the\r\ndogs in passing or during the occasional escapades from their shelter\r\nwere always eager to attack.\r\n\r\nHodgeman helped to change the appearance of the living-hut by cutting\r\nthe table in two and, since there was now plenty of room, by putting in\r\nmore shelves for a larder on which the storeman displayed his inviting\r\nwares to the cook, who could think of nothing original for the next\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nMcLean undertook the duties of ice-cutting and coal-carrying throughout\r\nthe year, kept the biological log and assisted in general observations.\r\nHe also sent off sealed messages in bottles, regularly, on the chance of\r\ntheir being picked up on the high seas, thereby giving some indication\r\nof the direction of currents.\r\n\r\nJeffryes was occupied regularly every night listening attentively for\r\nwireless signals and calling at intervals. The continuous winds soon\r\ncaused many of the wire stays of the main wireless mast to become slack,\r\nand these Jeffryes pulled taut on his daily rounds.\r\n\r\nLooking back and forward, we could not but feel that the sledging\r\nprogramme of the previous summer had been so comprehensive that the\r\nbroad features of the land were ascertained over a wide radius; beyond\r\nwhat we, with our weakened resources of the second year, could reach.\r\nThe various observations we were carrying on were adding to the value of\r\nthe scientific results, but we could not help feeling disappointed that\r\nour lot was not cast in a new and more clement region.\r\n\r\nIt was to be a dreary and difficult time for the five men who had\r\nvolunteered to remain behind in order to make a thorough search for\r\nmyself and comrades. They were men whom I had learned to appreciate\r\nduring the first year, and I now saw their sterling characters in a new\r\nlight. To Jeffryes all was fresh, and we envied him the novelties of\r\na new world, rough and inhospitable though it was. As for me, it was\r\nsufficient to feel that\r\n\r\n  ...He that tossed thee down into the Field,\r\n     He knows about it all--He knows, He knows.\r\n\r\nOn the night of February 15, Jeffryes suddenly surprised us with the\r\nexciting intelligence that he had heard Macquarie Island send a coded\r\nweather report to Hobart. The engine was immediately set going, but\r\nthough repeated attempts were made, no answer could be elicited. Each\r\nnight darkness was more pronounced and signals became more distinct,\r\nuntil, on the 20th, our call reached Sawyer at Macquarie Island, who\r\nimmediately responded by saying \"Good evening.\" The insulation of a\r\nLeyden jar broke down at this point, and nothing more could be done\r\nuntil it was remedied.\r\n\r\nAt last, on February 21, signals were exchanged, and by the 23rd a\r\nmessage had been dispatched to Lord Denman, Governor-General of the\r\nCommonwealth, acquainting him with our situation and the loss of our\r\ncomrades and, through him, one to his Majesty the King requesting his\r\nroyal permission to name a tract of newly discovered country to the\r\neast, \"King George V Land.\" Special messages were also sent to the\r\nrelatives of Lieutenant B. E. S. Ninnis and Dr. X. Mertz.\r\n\r\nThe first news received from the outside world was the bare statement\r\nthat Captain Scott and four of his companions had perished on their\r\njourney to the South Pole. It was some time before we knew the tragic\r\ndetails which came home, direct and poignant, to us in Adelie Land.\r\n\r\nTo Professor David a fuller account of our own calamity was sent and,\r\nfollowing this, many kind messages of sympathy and congratulation were\r\nreceived from all over the world. On February 26 Lord Denman sent an\r\nacknowledgment of our message to him, expressing his sorrow at the loss\r\nof our two companions; and on March 7 his Majesty the King added his\r\ngracious sympathy, with permission to affix the name, King George V\r\nLand, to that part of the Antarctic continent lying between Adelie Land\r\nand Oates Land.\r\n\r\nOn February 23 there was a spell of dead calm; heavy nimbus clouds and\r\nfog lowering over sea and plateau. Fluffy grains of sago snow fell most\r\nof the day, covering the dark rocks and the blue glacier. A heaving\r\nswell came in from the north, and many seals landed within the boat\r\nharbour, where a high tide lapped over the ice-foot. The bergs and\r\nislands showed pale and shadowy as the snow ceased or the fog lifted.\r\nThen the wind arose and blew hard from the east-south-east for a day,\r\nswinging round with added force to its old quarter--south-by-east.\r\n\r\nMarch began in earnest with much snow and monotonous days of wind. By\r\ncontrast, a few hours of sunny calm were appreciated to the full. The\r\nface of the landscape changed; the rocky crevices filling flush with the\r\nlow mounds of snow which trailed along and off the ridges.\r\n\r\nOn March 16 every one was relieved to hear that the 'Aurora' had arrived\r\nsafely in Hobart, and that Wild and his party were all well. But the\r\nnews brought disappointment too, for we had always a lingering ray of\r\nhope that there might be sufficient coal to bring the vessel back to\r\nAdelie Land. Later on we learned that on account of the shortage of\r\nfunds the Ship was to be laid up at Hobart until the following summer.\r\nIn the meantime, Professors David and Masson were making every effort to\r\nraise the necessary money. In this they were assisted by Captain Davis,\r\nwho went to London to obtain additional donations.\r\n\r\nIt was now a common thing for those of us who had gone to bed before\r\nmidnight to wake up in the morning and find that quite a budget of\r\nwireless messages had been received. It took the place of a morning\r\npaper and we made the most of the intelligence, discussing it from every\r\npossible point of view. Jeffryes and Bickerton worked every night from 8\r\nP.M. until 1 A.M., calling at short intervals and listening attentively\r\nat the receiver. In fact, notes were kept of the intensity of\r\nthe signals, the presence of local atmospheric electrical\r\ndischarges--\"static\"--or intermittent sounds due to discharges from snow\r\nparticles--St. Elmo's fire--and, lastly, of interference in the\r\nsignals transmitted. The latter phenomenon should lead to interesting\r\ndeductions, for we had frequent evidence to show that the wireless waves\r\nwere greatly impeded or completely abolished during times of auroral\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nListening at the wireless receiver must have been very tedious and\r\nnerve-racking work, as so many adventitious sounds had to be neglected.\r\nThere was, first of all, the noise of the wind as it swept by the Hut;\r\nthen there was the occasional crackling of \"St. Elmo's fire\"; the dogs\r\nin the veranda shelter were not always remarkable for their quietness;\r\nwhile within the Hut it was impossible to avoid slight sounds which were\r\noften sufficient to interrupt the sequence of a message. At times,\r\nwhen the aurora was visible, signals would often die away, and the only\r\nalternative was to wait until they recurred, meanwhile keeping up calls\r\nat regular intervals in case the ether was not \"blocked.\" So Jeffryes\r\nwould sometimes spend the whole evening trying to transmit a single\r\nmessage, or, conversely, trying to receive one. By experience it was\r\nfound easier to transmit and receive wireless messages between certain\r\nhours in the evening, while not infrequently, during the winter months,\r\na whole week would go by and nothing could be done. During such a period\r\nauroral displays were usually of nightly occurrence. Then a \"freak\r\nnight\" would come along and business would be brisk at both terminals.\r\n\r\nIt was often possible for Jeffryes to \"hear\" Wellington, Sydney,\r\nMelbourne and Hobart, and once he managed to communicate directly\r\nwith the last-named. Then there were numerous ships passing along the\r\nsouthern shores of Australia or in the vicinity of New Zealand whose\r\n\"calls\" were audible on \"good nights.\" The warships were at times\r\nparticularly distinct, and occasionally the \"chatter in the ether\" was\r\nso confusing that Sawyer, at Macquarie Island, would signal that he was\r\n\"jammed.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"wireless\" gave us another interest in life, and plenty of outside\r\noccupation when the stays became loose or an accident occurred. It\r\nserved to relieve some of the tedium of that second year:\r\n\r\n    Day after day the same\r\n    Only a little worse.\r\n\r\nOn March 13 there was a tremendous fall of snow, and worst \"pea-souper\"\r\nwe had had during the previous year. Next day everything was deluged,\r\nand right up the glacier there were two-foot drifts, despite a\r\nsixty-mile wind.\r\n\r\nIt was very interesting to follow the changes which occurred from day to\r\nday. First of all, under the flail of the incessant wind, a crust would\r\nform on the surface of the snow of the type we knew as \"piecrust,\"\r\nwhen out sledging. It was never strong enough to bear a man, but the\r\nsledge-runners would clear it fairly well if the load were not too\r\nheavy. Next day the crust would be etched, and small flakes and pellets\r\nwould be carried away until the snow was like fleece. Assuming that the\r\nwind kept up (which it always did) long, shallow concavities would\r\nnow be scooped out as the \"lobules\" of the fleece were carried away\r\npiecemeal. These concavities became deeper, hour by hour and day by day,\r\nbecoming at last the troughs between the crests of the snow-waves or\r\nsastrugi. All this time the surface would be gradually hardening and, if\r\nthe sun chanced to shine for even a few hours every day, a shining glaze\r\nwould gradually form on the long, bevelled mounds. It was never a wise\r\nthing to walk on these polished areas in finnesko and this fact was\r\nalways learnt by experience.\r\n\r\nAbove the Hut, where the icy slopes fell quickly to the sea, the snow\r\nwould lie for a few days at the very most, but, lower down, where the\r\nglacier ran almost level for a short distance to the harbour ice, the\r\ndrifts would lie for months at the mercy of the wind, furrowed and cut\r\ninto miniature canyons; wearing away in fragments until the blue ice\r\nshowed once more, clear and wind-swept.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of March the wind gave a few exhibitions of its power,\r\nwhich did not augur well for the maximum periods of the winter. A few\r\ndiary jottings are enough to show this:\r\n\r\n\"March 23. During the previous night the wind steadily rose to an\r\neighty-mile 'touch' and upwards. It was one of those days when it is a\r\nperpetual worry to be outside.\r\n\r\n\"March 24. Doing at least seventy miles per hour during the morning.\r\nAbout 8 P.M. there was a temporary lull and a rise of.15 in the\r\nbarometer. Now, 9.30 P.M., it is going 'big guns.' The drift is fairly\r\nthick and snow is probably falling.\r\n\r\n\"March 25. Much the same as yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"March 28. In a seventy-five-mile wind, Hodgeman had several fingers\r\nfrost-bitten this morning while attending to the anemograph.\r\n\r\n\"March 29. It was quite sunny when we opened the trap-door, though it\r\nblew about sixty miles per hour with light drift.\r\n\r\n\"March 30. The wind is doing itself full justice. About 8 P.M. it ranged\r\nbetween ninety-five and one hundred miles per hour, and now the whole\r\nhut is tremulous and the stove-pipe vibrates so that the two large pots\r\non the stove rattle.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of April, McLean laid the foundations of The Adelie\r\nBlizzard which recorded our life for the next seven months. It was a\r\nmonthly publication, and contributions were invited from all on every\r\nsubject but the wind. Anything from light doggerel to heavy blank verse\r\nwas welcomed, and original articles, letters to the Editor, plays,\r\nreviews on books and serial stories were accepted within the limits of\r\nour supply of foolscap paper and type-writer ribbons.\r\n\r\n     _____________________________________________________\r\n   /                                                      \\\r\n  /             THE ADELIE BLIZZARD                         \\\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  |  / Registered at the General Plateau Office          \\\r\n  |/                                                       \\ |\r\n  | /  for transmission by wind as a newspaper           \\   |\r\n  | /                                                      \\ |\r\n  |    -o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-                       |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  |                ----CONTENTS----                          |\r\n  |                     o-o-o-o-                             |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  |  Editorial..............................

Extracts from the April number were read\r\nafter dinner one evening and excited much amusement. An \"Ode to Tobacco\"\r\nwas very popular, and seemed to voice the enthusiasm of our small\r\ncommunity, while \"The Evolution of Women\" introduced us to a\r\nonce-familiar subject. The Editor was later admitted by wireless to the\r\nJournalists' Association (Sydney).\r\n\r\nMany have asked the question, \"What did you do to fill in the time\r\nduring the second year?\"\r\n\r\nThe duties of cook and night-watchman came to each man once every week,\r\nand meteorological and magnetic observations went on daily. Then we were\r\nable to devote a good deal of time to working up the scientific work\r\naccomplished during the sledging journeys. The wireless watches kept\r\ntwo men well occupied, and in spare moments the chief recreation was\r\nreading. There was a fine supply of illustrated journals and periodicals\r\nwhich had arrived by the 'Aurora', and with papers like the 'Daily\r\nGraphic', 'Illustrated London News', 'Sphere' and 'Punch', we tried to\r\nmake up the arrears of a year in exile. The \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\"\r\nwas a great boon, being always \"the last word\" in the settlement of a\r\ndebated point. Chess and cards were played on several occasions. Again,\r\nwhenever the weather gave the smallest opportunity, there were jobs\r\noutside, digging for cases, attending to the wireless mast and, in the\r\nspring, geological collecting and dredging. If the air was clear of\r\ndrift, and the wind not over fifty miles per hour, one could spend a\r\npleasant hour or more walking along the shore watching the birds and\r\nnoting the changes in \"scenery\" which were always occurring along our\r\nshort \"selection\" of rocks. During 1912 we had been able to study all\r\nthe typical features of our novel and beautiful environment, but 1913\r\nwas the period of \"intensive cultivation\" and we would have gladly\r\nforgone much of it. Divine service was usually held on Sunday mornings,\r\nbut in place of it we sometimes sang hymns during the evening, or\r\narranged a programme of sacred selections on the gramophone. There was a\r\ngreat loss in our singing volume after the previous year, which Hodgeman\r\nendeavoured to remedy by striking up an accompaniment on the organ.\r\n\r\nCooking reached its acme, according to our standard, and each man became\r\nremarkable for some particular dish. Bage was the exponent of steam\r\npuddings of every variety, and Madigan could always be relied upon for\r\nan unfailing batch of puff-pastry. Bickerton once started out with the\r\nobject of cooking a ginger pudding, and in an unguarded moment used\r\nmixed spices instead of ginger. The result was rather appetizing, and\r\n\"mixed-spice pudding\" was added to an original list. McLean specialized\r\nin yeast waffles, having acquired the art of tossing pancakes. Jeffryes\r\nhad come on the scene with a limited experience, but his first milk\r\nscones gained him a reputation which he managed to make good. Hodgeman\r\nfell back on the cookery book before embarking on the task of preparing\r\ndinner, but the end-product, so to speak, which might be invariably\r\nexpected for \"sweets\" was tapioca pudding. Penguin meat had always\r\nbeen in favour. Now special care was devoted to seal meat, and, after\r\na while, mainly owing to the rather copious use of onion powder, no one\r\ncould say for certain which was which.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous year, yeast had been cultivated successfully\r\nfrom Russian stout. The experiments were continued, and all available\r\ninformation was gathered from cookery books and the Encyclopaedia.\r\nRussian stout, barley wine, apple rings, sugar, flour and mould from\r\npotatoes were used in several mixtures and eventually fermentation was\r\nstarted. Bread-making was the next difficulty, and various instructions\r\nwere tried in succession. The method of \"trial and error\" was at\r\nlast responsible for the first light spongy loaf, and then every\r\nnight-watchman cultivated the art and baked for the ensuing day.\r\n\r\nOn April 8 the snow had gathered deeply everywhere and we had some\r\nexercise on skis. Several of the morainic areas were no longer visible,\r\nand it was possible to run between the rocks for a considerable\r\ndistance. A fresh breeze came up during the afternoon and provided a\r\nsplendid impetus for some good slides. During the short calm, twenty-six\r\nseals landed on the harbour-ice.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the same day Mary gave birth to five pups in the\r\nTransit House. The place was full of cracks, through which snow and wind\r\nwere always driving, and so we were not surprised when four of them were\r\nfound to have died. The survivor was named \"Hoyle\" (a cognomen for our\r\nold friend Hurley) and his doings gave us a new fund of entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe other dogs had been penned in the veranda and in tolerable weather\r\nwere brought outside to be fed. Carrying an axe, Madigan usually went\r\ndown to the boat harbour, followed by the expectant pack, to where there\r\nwere several seal carcases. These lay immovably frozen to the ice, and\r\nwere cut about and hacked so that the meat in section reminded one of\r\nthe grain of a log of red gum, and it was certainly quite as hard. When\r\nMadigan commenced to chop, the dogs would range themselves on the lee\r\nside and \"field\" the flying chips.\r\n\r\nOn April 16 the last penguin was seen on a ledge overhanging an icy cove\r\nto the east. Apparently its moulting time had not expired, but it was\r\ncertainly a very miserable bird, smothered in small icicles and snow and\r\npartly exposed to a sixty-five mile wind with the temperature close to\r\n-10 degrees F. Petrels were often seen flying along the foreshores and\r\nno wind appeared to daunt them. It was certainly a remarkable thing to\r\nwitness a snow-petrel, small, light and fragile, making headway over the\r\nsea in the face of an eighty-mile hurricane, fluttering down through the\r\nspindrift to pick up a morsel of food which it had detected. Close to\r\nthe western cliffs there was a trail of brash-ice where many birds were\r\noften observed feeding on Euphausia (crustaceans) in weather when it\r\nscarcely seemed possible for any living creature to be abroad.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nThe meteorological chart for April 12, 1913, compiled by the\r\nCommonwealth Meteorological Bureau\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt appends the following explanation: \"A very intense cyclone\r\npassing south of Macquarie Island, where the barometer fell on the 11th\r\nfrom 29.49 at 9 A.M. to 29.13 at 6 P.M., and the next day to 28.34 at\r\n9 A.M. and 27.91 at 6 P.M. At Adelie Land the barometer was not greatly\r\naffected, but rose in sympathy with the passage of the 'low' from 28.70\r\nto 28.90 during the twenty-four hours. The influence of this cyclone was\r\nvery wide and probably embraced both Adelie Land and Tasmania.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout April news by wireless came in slowly and spasmodically, and\r\nJeffryes was becoming resigned to the eccentricities of the place. As\r\nan example of the unfavourable conditions which sometimes prevailed: on\r\nApril 14 the wind was steady, in the nineties, with light drift and,\r\nat times, the aurora would illumine the north-west sky. Still, during\r\n\"quiet\" intervals, two messages came through and were acknowledged.\r\n\r\nA coded weather report, which had priority over all other messages, was\r\nsent out each night, and it is surprising how often Jeffryes managed to\r\ntransmit this important intelligence. On evenings when receiving was an\r\nimpossibility, owing to a continual stream of St. Elmo's fire, the three\r\ncode words for the barometric reading, the velocity and direction of\r\nthe wind were signalled repeatedly and, on the following night, perhaps,\r\nMacquarie Island would acknowledge them. Of course we had to use new\r\nsigns for the higher wind velocities, as no provision had been made for\r\nthem in our meteorological code-book. The reports from Macquarie Island\r\nand Adelie Land were communicated to Mr. Hunt of the Commonwealth\r\nWeather Bureau and to Mr. Bates of the Dominion Meteorological Office,\r\nwho plotted them out for their daily weather forecasts.\r\n\r\nIt was very gratifying to learn that the Macquarie Island party to a man\r\nhad consented to remain at their lonely post and from Ainsworth,\r\ntheir leader, I received a brief report of the work which had been\r\naccomplished by each member. We all could appreciate the sacrifice they\r\nwere making. Then, too, an account was received of the great sledging\r\nefforts which had been made by Wild and his men to the west. But it was\r\nnot till the end of the year that their adventurous story was related to\r\nus in detail.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd Lassie, one of the dogs, was badly wounded in a fight and\r\nhad to be shot. Quarrels amongst the dogs had to be quelled immediately,\r\notherwise they would probably mean the death of some unfortunate animal\r\nwhich happened to be thrown down amongst the pack. Whenever a dog was\r\ndown, it was the way of these brutes to attack him irrespective of\r\nwhether they were friends or foes.\r\n\r\nAmong our dogs there were several groups whose members always consorted\r\ntogether. Thus, George and Lassie were friends and, when the latter was\r\nkilled, George, who was naturally a miserable, downtrodden creature,\r\nbecame a kind of pariah, morose and solitary and at war with all except\r\nPeary and Fix, with whom he and Lassie had been associated in fights\r\nagainst the rest. The other dogs lived together in some kind of harmony,\r\nJack and Amundsen standing out as particular chums, while the \"pups,\" as\r\nwe called them--D'Urville, Ross and Wilkes (\"Monkey\")--were a trio born\r\nin Adelie Land and, therefore, comrades in misfortune. Hoyle, as a pup,\r\nwas treated benevolently by all the others, and entered the fellowship\r\nof the other three when he grew up. Among the rest, Mikkel stood out as\r\na good fighter, Colonel as the biggest dog and ringleader against the\r\nPeary-Fix faction, Fram as a nervous intractable animal, and Mary as the\r\nsole representative of the sex.\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable that Peary, Fix and George in their hatred of the\r\nothers, who were penned up in the dog shelter during bad weather, would\r\nabsent themselves for days on a snow ramp near the Magnetograph House,\r\nwhere they were partly protected from the wind by rocks. George, from\r\nbeing a mere associate of Peary and Fix, became more amiable as the\r\nyear went by, and at times it was quite pathetic to see his attempts at\r\nfriendliness.\r\n\r\nWe became very fond of the dogs despite their habit of howling at night\r\nand their wolfish ferocity. They always gave one a welcome, in drift or\r\nsunshine, and though ruled by the law of force, they had a few domestic\r\ntraits to make them civilized.\r\n\r\nMay was a dreaded month because it had been the period of worst wind and\r\ndrift during 1912. On this occasion the wind velocities over four\r\nweeks were not so high and constant, though the snowfall was just as\r\npersistent. On the 17th and 18th, however, there was an unexpected\r\n\"jump\" to the nineties. The average over the first twenty-four hours\r\nwas eighty-three, and on the 18th it attained 93.7 miles per hour. One\r\nterrific rise between 6.30 and 7.30 on the night of the 17th was shown\r\nas one hundred and three miles on the anemometer--the record up to that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMadigan was thrown over and had a hard fall on his arm, smashing a\r\nbottle of the special ink which was used for the anemograph pen. Bage\r\nrelated how he had sailed across the Magnetic Flat by sitting down\r\nand raising his arms in the air. He was accompanied by Fix, Peary and\r\nGeorge, who were blown along the slippery surface for yards. McLean had\r\na \"lively time\" cutting ice and bringing in the big blocks. Often he\r\nwould slide away with a large piece, and \"pull up\" on a snow patch\r\ntwenty yards to leeward.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd there were hours of gusts which came down like thunderbolts,\r\nmaking us apprehensive for the safety of the wireless masts; we had\r\ngrown to trust the stability of the Hut. Every one who went outside came\r\nback with a few experiences. Jeffryes was roughly handled through not\r\nwearing crampons, and several cases of kerosene, firmly stacked on the\r\nbreak-wind, were dislodged and thrown several yards.\r\n\r\nEmpire Day was celebrated in Adelie Land with a small display. At 2.30\r\nP.M. the Union Jack was hoisted to the topmast and three cheers were\r\ngiven for the King. The wind blew at fifty miles an hour with light\r\ndrift, temperature -3 degrees F. Empire greetings were sent to the\r\nColonial Secretary, London, and to Mr Fisher, Prime Minister of\r\nAustralia. These were warmly reciprocated a few days afterwards.\r\n\r\nPreceded by a day of whirlies on the 7th and random gusts on the same\r\nevening, the wind made a determined attack next morning and carried away\r\nthe top and part of the middle section of the main wireless mast. It\r\nwas a very unexpected event, lulled as we were into security by the fact\r\nthat May, the worst month, had passed. On examination it was found that\r\ntwo of the topmast wire stays had chafed through, whilst another had\r\nparted. At first it seemed a hopeless task to re-erect the mast, but\r\ngradually ways and means were discussed, and we waited for the first\r\ncalm day to put the theories into execution.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it was suggested that if a heavy kite were made and induced\r\nto fly in the continuous winds, the aerial thus provided would be\r\nsufficient to receive wireless messages. To this end, Bage and Bickerton\r\nset to work, and the first invention was a Venesta-box kite which was\r\ntried in a steady seventy-mile wind. Despite its weight,--at least ten\r\npounds --the kite rose immediately, steadied by guys on either side, and\r\nthen suddenly descended with a crash on to the glacier ice. After the\r\nthird fall the kite was too battered to be of any further use. Another\r\ndevice, in which an empty carbide tin was employed, and still another,\r\nmaking use of an old propeller, shared the same fate.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 19th a perfect coloured corona, three degrees\r\nin diameter, was observed encircling the moon in a sky which lit up at\r\nintervals with dancing auroral curtains. Coronae or \"glories,\" which\r\nclosely invest the luminary, are due to diffraction owing to immense\r\nnumbers of very minute water or ice particles floating in the air\r\nbetween the observer and the source of light. The larger the particles\r\nthe smaller the corona, so that by a measurement of the diameter of a\r\ncorona the size of the particles can be calculated. Earlier in the\r\nyear, a double corona had been seen when the moon was shining through\r\ncirro-cumulus clouds. Haloes, on the other hand, are wide circles (or\r\narcs of circles) in the sky surrounding the sun or moon, and arising\r\nfrom light-refraction in myriads of tiny ice-crystals suspended in\r\nthe atmosphere. They were very commonly noted in Adelie Land where the\r\nconditions were so ideal for their production.\r\n\r\nMidwinter's Day 1913! we had reached a turning-point in the season.\r\nThe Astronomer Royal told us that at eight o'clock on June 22 the sun\r\ncommenced to return, and every one took note of the fact. The sky was\r\novercast, the air surcharged with drifting snow, and the wind was forty\r\nmiles an hour--a representative day as far as the climate was concerned.\r\nThe cook made a special effort and the menu bore the following foreword:\r\n\r\n    Now is the winter of our discontent\r\n    Made glorious summer....\r\n\r\nOn July 6 the wind moderated, and we set about repairing once more the\r\nfortunes of the \"wireless.\" The shattered topmast used to sway about\r\nin the heavy winds, threatening to bring down the rest of the mast.\r\nBickerton, therefore, climbed up with a saw and cut it almost through\r\nabove the doubling. All hands then pulled hard, and the upper\r\npart cracked off, the lower section being easily removed from the\r\ncross-trees. The mast now looked \"shipshape\" and ready for future\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to use as a topmast the mast which had been formerly\r\nemployed to support the northern half of the aerial. So on the 29th this\r\nwas lowered and removed to the veranda to be fitted for erection.\r\n\r\nAlmost a fortnight now elapsed, during which the weather was\r\n\"impossible.\" In fact, the wind was frightful throughout the whole\r\nmonth of July, surpassing all its previous records and wearing out our\r\nmuch-tried patience. All that one could do was to work on and try grimly\r\nto ignore it. On July 2 we noted: \"Thick as a wall outside with an\r\neighty-five miler.\" And so it commenced and continued for a day,\r\nsubsiding slowly through the seventies to the fifties and then suddenly\r\nredoubling in strength, rose to a climax about midnight on the 5th--one\r\nhundred and sixteen miles an hour! For eight hours it maintained an\r\naverage of one hundred and seven miles an hour, and the timbers of\r\nthe Hut seemed to be jarred and wrenched as the wind throbbed in its\r\nmightier gusts. These were the highest wind-velocities recorded during\r\nour two years' residence in Adelie Land and are probably the highest\r\nsustained velocities ever reported from a meteorological station.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few Antarctic and snow petrels flying over the\r\nsea on the calmer days, no life had been seen round the Hut during June.\r\nSo it was with some surprise that we sighted a Weddell seal on July\r\n9 attempting to land on the harbour-ice in a seventy-five-mile wind.\r\nSeveral times it clambered over the edge and on turning broadside to the\r\nwind was actually tumbled back into the water. Eventually it struggled\r\ninto the lee of some icy hummocks, but only remained there for a few\r\nminutes, deciding that the water was much warmer.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th there was an exceptionally low barometer at 27.794\r\ninches. At the same time the wind ran riot once more--two hundred and\r\nninety-eight miles in three hours. The highest barometric reading was\r\nrecorded on September 3, 30.4 inches, and the comparison indicates a\r\nwide range for a station at sea-level.\r\n\r\nTo show how quickly conditions would change, it was almost calm next\r\nmorning, and all hands were in readiness to advance the wireless mast\r\nanother stage. Previously there had been three masts, one high one in\r\nthree lengths, and two smaller ones of one length each, between which\r\nthe aerial stretched; the \"lead-in\" wires being connected to the middle\r\nof the aerial. This is known as an \"umbrella aerial.\" Since we were\r\nwithout one short mast it was resolved to erect a \"directive\" [capital\r\ngamma gjc]-shaped aerial. The mainmast was to be in two instead of three\r\nlengths, and we wondered if the aerial would be high enough. In any\r\ncase, it was so calm early on the 11th that we ventured to erect the\r\ntopmast and had hauled it half-way, when the wind swooped down from the\r\nplateau, and there was just time to make fast the stays and the hauling\r\nrope and to leave things \"snug\" for the next spell of bad weather.\r\n\r\nIn eight days another opportunity came, and this time the topmast was\r\nhoisted, wedged and securely stayed. Bickerton had fixed a long bolt\r\nthrough the middle of the topmast and just above it three additional\r\nwire stays were to be placed. Another fine day and we reckoned to finish\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nFrom July 26 onwards the sky was cloudless for a week, and each day the\r\nnorthern sun would rise a fraction of a degree higher. The wind was very\r\nconstant and of high velocity.\r\n\r\nIt was a grand sight to witness the sea in a hurricane on a driftless,\r\nclear day. Crouched under a rock on Azimuth Hill, and looking across\r\nto the west along the curving brink of the cliffs, one could watch the\r\nwater close inshore blacken under the lash of the wind, whiten into foam\r\nfarther off, and then disappear into the hurrying clouds of spray and\r\nsea-smoke. Over the Mackellar Islets and the \"Pianoforte Berg\" columns\r\nof spray would shoot up like geysers, and fly away in the mad race to\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nEarly in July Jeffryes became ill, and for some weeks his symptoms were\r\nsuch as to give every one much anxiety. His work on the wireless had\r\nbeen assiduous at all times, and there is no doubt that the continual\r\nand acute strain of sending and receiving messages under unprecedented\r\nconditions was such that he eventually had a \"nervous breakdown.\"\r\nUnfortunately the weather was so atrocious, and the conditions under\r\nwhich we were placed so peculiarly difficult, that nothing could be done\r\nto brighten his prospects. McLean considered that as the spring returned\r\nand it became possible to take more exercise outside, the nervous\r\nexhaustion would pass off. In the meantime Jeffryes took a complete\r\nrest, and slowly improved as the months went by, and our hopes of relief\r\ncame nearer. It was a great misfortune for our comrade, especially as it\r\nwas his first experience of such a climate, and he had applied himself\r\nto work with enthusiasm and perhaps in an over-conscientious spirit.\r\n\r\nJuly concluded its stormy career with the astonishing wind-average of\r\n63.6 miles an hour. We were all relieved to see Friday, August 1, appear\r\non the modest calendar, which it was the particular pleasure of each\r\nnight-watchman to change. More light filtered day by day through the ice\r\non the kitchen window, midwinter lay behind, and we were ready to hail\r\nthe first signs of returning spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV NEARING THE END\r\n\r\n    Seven men from all the world, back to town again,\r\n    Seven men from out of hell.\r\n                                 Kipling\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how quickly the weeks seemed to pass. Situated as we\r\nwere, Time became quite an object of study to us and its imperceptible\r\ndrift was almost a reality, considering that each day was another step\r\ntowards liberty--freedom from the tyranny of the wind. In a sense, the\r\nendless surge of the blizzard was a slow form of torture, and the subtle\r\neffect it had on the mind was measurable in the delight with which one\r\ngreeted a calm, fine morning, or noted some insignificant fact which\r\nbespoke the approach of a milder season. Thus in August, although the\r\nweather was colder, there were the merest signs of thawing along the\r\nedges of the snow packed against the rocky faces which looked towards\r\nthe sun; Weddell seals came back to the land, and the petrels would at\r\ntimes appear in large flocks; all of which are very commonplace events\r\nwhich any one might have expected, but at the time they had more than\r\ntheir face value.\r\n\r\nAugust 5 was undoubtedly a great day from our very provincial point of\r\nview. On the 4th there had been a dense drift, during which the Hut\r\nwas buttressed round with soft snow which rose above the eaves and half\r\nfilled the entrance-veranda. The only way in which the night-watchman\r\ncould keep the hourly observations was to dig his way out frequently\r\nwith a shovel. In the early morning hours of the 5th the wind abated\r\nand veered right round from south through east to north-east, from which\r\nquarter it remained as a fresh breeze with falling snow. By 7 A.M.\r\nthe air was still, and outside there was a dead world of whiteness;\r\nflocculent heaps of down rolling up to where glimpses of rock streaked\r\nblack near the skyline of the ridges, striated masses of livid cloud\r\noverhead, and to the horizon the dark berg-strewn sea, over which the\r\nsnow birds fluttered.\r\n\r\nWe did not linger over the scenery, but set to work to hoist to the head\r\nof the mainmast the aerial, which had been hurriedly put together. The\r\njob occupied till lunch-time, and then a jury-mast was fixed to the\r\nsouthern supporting mast, and by dusk the aerial hung in position.\r\nBickerton was the leading spirit in the work and subsequently steadied\r\nthe mainmast with eighteen wire stays, in the determination to make\r\nit stable enough to weather the worst hurricane. The attempt was so\r\nsuccessful that in an ordinary fifty-mile \"blow\" the mast vibrated\r\nslightly, and in higher winds exhibited the smallest degree of movement.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock that night, Jeffryes, who felt so benefited by his rest\r\nthat he was eager to commence operating once more, had soon \"attuned\"\r\nhis instrument to Macquarie Island, and in a few minutes communication\r\nwas reestablished.\r\n\r\nWe learned from the Governor-General, Lord Denman, that her Majesty the\r\nQueen was \"graciously pleased to consent to the name 'Queen Mary Land'\r\nbeing given to newly discovered land.\" The message referred to the tract\r\nof Antarctic coast which had been discovered and mapped by Wild and his\r\nparty to the west.\r\n\r\nOn August 6 Macquarie Island signalled that they had run short of\r\nprovisions. The message was rather a paradox: \" Food done, but otherwise\r\nall right.\" However, on August 11, we were reassured to hear that the\r\n'Tutanekai', a New Zealand Government steamer, had been commissioned to\r\nrelieve the party, and that Sawyer through ill-health had been obliged\r\nto return to Australia. A sealing-ship, the 'Rachel Cohen', after\r\nbattling for almost the whole month of July against gales, in an\r\nendeavour to reach the island, with stores for our party and the\r\nsealers, had returned damaged to port.\r\n\r\nMarvellous to relate we had two calm days in succession, and on the 6th\r\nthe snow lay so deeply round the Hut that progression without skis was a\r\nlaborious flounder. The dogs plunged about in great glee, rolling in\r\nthe snow and \"playing off\" their surplus energy after being penned for a\r\nlong spell in the shelter.\r\n\r\nOn skis one could push up the first slopes of the glacier for a long\r\ndistance. Soft snow had settled two feet thick even on the steep icy\r\ndownfalls. The sea to the north was frozen into large cakes between\r\nwhich ran a network of dark water \"leads.\" With glasses we could make\r\nout in the near distance five seals and two tall solitary figures which\r\nwere doubtless Emperor penguins. During the whole day nimbus clouds had\r\nhung heavily from the sky, and snow had fallen in grains and star-like\r\ncrystals. Gradually the nimbus lightened, a rift appeared overhead,\r\nand,the edges of the billowy cumulus were burnished in the light of the\r\nlow sun. The sea-horizon came sharply into sight through fading mist.\r\nBergs and islands, from being ghostly images, rose into sharp-featured\r\nreality. The masts and Hut, with a dark riband of smoke floating from\r\nthe chimney, lay just below, and two of the men were walking out to the\r\nharbour-ice where a seal had just landed, while round them scampered the\r\ndogs in high spirits. That was sufficient to set us sliding downhill,\r\nploughing deep furrows through the soft drift and reaching the Hut in\r\nquick time.\r\n\r\nDuring August we were able to do more work outside, thus enlarging our\r\nsphere of interest. Bage, who had been busy up till August 8 with his\r\ndaily magnetograph records, ran short of bromide papers and now had to\r\nbe contented with taking \"quick runs\" at intervals, especially when\r\nthe aurora was active. His astronomical observations had been very\r\ndisappointing owing to the continuous wind and drift. Still, in\r\nSeptember, which was marked by periods of fine weather, a few good star\r\nobservations were possible. Shafts were sunk in the sea-ice and up on\r\nthe glacier, just above the zone where the ice was loaded with stones\r\nand debris--the lower moraine. The glacier shaft was dug to a depth of\r\ntwenty-four feet, and several erratics were met with embedded in the\r\nice. In this particular part the crystalline structure of the ice\r\nresembled that of a gneiss, showing that it had flowed under pressure.\r\nI was able to make measurements of ablation on the glacier, to take\r\nobservations of the temperature and salinity of the sea-water, and to\r\nestimate the forward movement of the seaward cliffs of the ice-cap.\r\n\r\nGeological collecting now became quite a popular diversion. With\r\na slight smattering of \"gneiss,\" \"felspar,\" \"weathered limestone,\"\r\n\"garnets,\" and \"glacial markings\" the amateurs went off and made many\r\nfinds on the moraines, and the specimens were cached in heaps, to be\r\nlater brought home by the dogs, some of which were receiving their first\r\nlessons in sledge-pulling.\r\n\r\nRather belated, but none the less welcome, our midwinter wireless\r\ngreetings arrived on August 17 from many friends who could only\r\nimagine how much they were appreciated, and from various members of the\r\nExpedition who had spent the previous year in Adelie Land and who knew\r\nthe meaning of an Antarctic winter. A few evenings later, Macquarie\r\nIslanders had their reward in the arrival of the 'Tutanekai' from New\r\nZealand with supplies of food, and, piecing together a few fragments of\r\nevidence \"dropped in the ether,\" we judged that they were having a night\r\nof revelry.\r\n\r\nThe wind was in a fierce humour on the morning of August 16, mounting to\r\none hundred and five miles per hour between 9 and 10 A.M., and carrying\r\nwith it a very dense drift.\r\n\r\nWe were now in a position to sit down and generalize about the wind. It\r\nis a tiresome thing to have it as the recurring insistent theme of our\r\nstory, but to have had it as the continual obstacle to our activity, the\r\nopposing barrier to the simplest task, was even more tedious.\r\n\r\nA river, rather a torrent, of air rushes from the hinterland northward\r\nyear after year, replenished from a source which never fails. We had\r\nreason to believe that it was local in character, as apparently a\r\ngulf of open water about one hundred miles in width--the D'Urville\r\nSea--exists to the north of Adelie Land. Thus, far back in the\r\ninterior--back to the South Geographical Pole itself--across one\r\nthousand six hundred miles of lofty plateau--is a zone of high\r\nbarometric pressure, while to the north lies the D'Urville Sea and\r\nbeyond it the Southern Ocean--a zone of low pressure. As if through a\r\ncontracted outlet, thereby increasing the velocity of the flow, the wind\r\nsweeps down over Adelie Land to equalize the great air-pressure system.\r\nAnd so, in winter, the chilling of the plateau leads to the development\r\nof a higher barometric pressure and, as the open water to the north\r\npersists, to higher winds. In summer the suns shines on the Pole for six\r\nmonths, the uplands of the continent are warmed and the northern zone of\r\nlow pressure pushes southward. So, in Adelie Land, short spells of calm\r\nweather may be expected over a period of barely three months around\r\nthe summer solstice. This explanation is intentionally popular. The\r\nmeteorological problem is one which can only be fully discussed when\r\nall the manifold observations have been gathered together, from other\r\ncontemporary Antarctic expeditions, from our two stations on the\r\nAntarctic continent, and from Macquarie Island; all taken in conjunction\r\nwith weather conditions around Australia and New Zealand. Then, when all\r\nthe evidence is arrayed and compared, some general truths of particular\r\nvalue to science and, maybe, to commerce, should emerge.\r\n\r\nOf one thing we were certain, and that was that Adelie Land was the\r\nwindiest place in the world. To state the fact more accurately: such\r\nwind-velocities as prevail at sea-level in Adelie Land are known in\r\nother parts of the world only at great elevations in the atmosphere.\r\nThe average wind-velocity for our first year proved to be approximately\r\nfifty miles per hour. The bare figures convey more when they are\r\ncompared with the following average annual wind-velocities quoted from a\r\nbook of reference: Europe, 10.3 miles per hour; United States, 9.5 miles\r\nper hour; Southern Asia, 6.5 miles per hour; West Indies, 6.2 miles per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the fact that often the high winds\r\nceased abruptly for a short interval. Many times during 1913 we had\r\nopportunities of judging this phenomenon and, as an example, may be\r\nquoted September 6.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nA diagrammatic sketch illustrating the meteorological conditions at the\r\nmain base, noon, September 6, 1913\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that day a south-by-east hurricane fell off and the drift cleared\r\nsuddenly from about the Hut at 11.20 A.M. On the hills to the south\r\nthere was a dense grey wall of flying snow. Whirlies tracked about at\r\nintervals and overhead a fine cumulus cloud formed, revolving rapidly.\r\nOver the recently frozen sea there was an easterly breeze, while about\r\nthe Hut itself there were light northerly airs. Later in the day the\r\nzone of southern wind and drift crept down and once more overwhelmed us.\r\nEvidently the \"eye\" of a cyclonic storm had passed over.\r\n\r\nDuring September the sea was frozen over for more than two weeks,\r\nand the meteorological conditions varied from their normal phase. It\r\nappeared as if we were situated on the battlefield, so to speak, of\r\nopposing forces. The pacific influence of the \"north\" would hold sway\r\nfor a few hours, a whole day, or even for a few days. Then the vast\r\nenergies of the \"south\" would rise to bursting-point and a \"through\r\nblizzard\" would be the result.\r\n\r\nOn September 11, although there was a wind of seventy miles per hour,\r\nthe sea-ice which had become very solid during a few days of low\r\ntemperature was not dispersed. Next day we found it possible to walk\r\nin safety to the Mackellar Islets. On the way rushes of southerly wind\r\naccompanied by a misty drift followed behind us. Then a calm intervened,\r\nand the sun momentarily appeared and shone warmly. Suddenly from the\r\nnorth-west came breezy puffs which settled into a light wind as we\r\nwent north. On the way home we could not see the mainland for clouds of\r\ndrift, and, when approaching the mouth of the boat-harbour, these clouds\r\nwere observed to roll down the lower slopes of the glacier and, reaching\r\nthe shore, rise into the air in columns. They then sailed away northward\r\nat a higher altitude, almost obscuring the sun with a fine fog. On the\r\nsame night the \"south\" had gained the mastery, and the wind blew with\r\nits accustomed strength.\r\n\r\nAgain, on September 24, McLean had a unique experience. He was digging\r\nice in a fifty-mile wind with moderate drift close to the Hut and, on\r\nfinishing his work, walked down to the harbour-ice to see if there were\r\nany birds about. He was suddenly surprised to leave the wind and drift\r\nbehind and to walk out into an area of calm. The water lapped alongside\r\nthe ice-foot, blue in the brilliant sunlight. Away to the west a few\r\nmiles distant a fierce wind was blowing snow like fine spume over the\r\nbrink of the cliffs. Towards the north-west one could plainly see the\r\njunction between calm water and foam-crested waves. To the south the\r\ndrift drove off the hills, passed the Hut, and then gyrated upwards and\r\nthinned away seawards at an altitude of several hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe wind average for September was 36.8 miles per hour, as against 53.7\r\nfor September of the previous year. There were nine \"pleasant\" days,\r\nthat is, days on which it was possible to walk about outside and enjoy\r\noneself. On the 27th there was a very severe blizzard. The wind was\r\nfrom the south-east: the first occasion on which it had blown from any\r\ndirection but south-by-east at a high velocity. The drift was extremely\r\ndense, the roof of the Hut being invisible at a distance of six feet.\r\nEnormous ramps of snow formed in the vicinity, burying most of the cases\r\nand the air-tractor sledge completely. The anemograph screen was blown\r\nover and smashed beyond all repair. So said the Meteorological Notes in\r\nthe October number of the 'Adelie Blizzard'.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of temperature in general, it was found that the\r\nmean-temperature for the first year was just above zero; a very low\r\ntemperature for a station situated near the Circle. The continual flow\r\nof cold air from the elevated interior of the continent accounts for\r\nthis. If Adelie Land were a region of calms or of northerly winds, the\r\naverage temperature would be very much higher. On the other hand, the\r\ntemperature at sea-level was never depressed below-28 degrees F., though\r\nwith a high wind we found that uncomfortable enough, even in burberrys.\r\nDuring the spring sledging in 1912 the lowest temperature recorded was\r\n-35 degrees F. and it was hard to keep warm in sleeping-bags. The wind\r\nmade all the difference to one's resistance.\r\n\r\nThere was an unusually heavy snowfall during 1913. When the air was\r\nheavily charged with moisture, as in midsummer, the falls would consist\r\nof small (sago) or larger (tapioca) rounded pellets. Occasionally\r\none would see beautiful complicated patterns in the form of hexagonal\r\nflakes. When low temperatures were the rule, small, plain, hexagonal\r\nstars or spicules fell. Often throughout a single snowfall many types\r\nwould be precipitated. Thus, in September, in one instance, the fall\r\ncommenced with fluffy balls and then passed to tapioca snow, sago snow,\r\nsix-rayed stars and spicules.\r\n\r\nWireless communication was still maintained, though September was\r\nfound to be such a \"disturbed\" month--possibly owing to the brilliant\r\naurorae--that not a great many messages were exchanged. Jeffryes was not\r\nin the best of health, so that Bickerton took over the operating\r\nwork. Though at first signals could only be received slowly, Bickerton\r\ngradually improved with practice and was able to \"keep up his end\" until\r\nNovember 20, when daylight became continuous. One great advantage, which\r\nby itself justified the existence of the wireless plant, was the fact\r\nthat time-signals were successfully received from Melbourne Observatory\r\nby way of Macquarie Island, and Bage was thus able to improve on his\r\nearlier determinations and to establish a fundamental longitude.\r\n\r\nDuring this same happy month of September, whose first day marked the\r\nevent of \"One hundred days to the coming of the Ship\" there was a great\r\nrevival in biological work. Hodgeman made several varieties of bag-traps\r\nwhich were lowered over the edge of the harbour-ice, and many large\r\n\"worms\" and crustaceans were caught and preserved.\r\n\r\nOn September 14 Bickerton started to construct a hand-dredge, which was\r\nready for use by the next evening. It was a lovely, cloudless day on\r\nthe 16th and the sea-ice, after more than two weeks, still spread to the\r\nnorth in a firm, unbroken sheet. We went out on skis to reconnoitre, and\r\nfound that the nearest \"lead\" was too far away to make dredging a safe\r\nproposition. So we were contented to kill a seal and bring it home\r\nbefore lunch, continuing to sink the ice-shaft above the moraine for the\r\nrest of the day.\r\n\r\nThe wind rose to the \"seventies\" on September 17, and the sea-ice\r\nwas scattered to the north. On the 19th--a fine day--there were many\r\ndetached pieces of floe which drifted in with a northerly breeze, and\r\non one of these, floating in an ice-girt cove to the west, a sea-leopard\r\nwas observed sunning himself. He was a big, vicious-looking brute, and\r\nwe determined to secure him if possible. The first thing was to dispatch\r\nhim before he escaped from the floe. This Madigan did in three shots\r\nfrom a Winchester rifle. A long steel-shod sledge was then dragged from\r\nthe Hut and used to bridge the interval between the ice-foot and the\r\nfloe. After the specimen had been flayed, the skin and a good supply\r\nof dogs' meat were hauled across and sledged home. On the 30th another\r\nsea-leopard came swimming in near the harbour's entrance, apparently on\r\nthe look-out for seals or penguins. Including the one seen during 1912,\r\nonly three of these animals were observed during our two years' sojourn\r\nin Adelie Land.\r\n\r\nDredgings in depths up to five fathoms were done inside the boat harbour\r\nand just off its entrance on five separate occasions between September\r\n22 and the end of the month. Many \"worms,\" crustaceans, pteropods,\r\nasteroids, gastropods and hydroids were obtained, and McLean and I had\r\nmany interesting hours classifying the specimens. The former preserved\r\nand labelled them, establishing a small laboratory in the loft above\r\nthe \"dining-room.\" The only disadvantage of this arrangement was that\r\nvarious \"foreign bodies\" would occasionally come tumbling through the\r\ninterspaces between the flooring boards of the loft while a meal was in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nSome Antarctic petrels were shot and examined for external and internal\r\nparasites. Fish were caught in two traps made by Hodgeman and myself\r\nin October, but unfortunately the larger of the two was lost during a\r\nblizzard. However, on October 11 a haul of fifty-two fish was made with\r\nhand-lines off the boat harbour, and we had a pleasant change in the\r\nmenu for dinner. They were of the type known as Notothenia, to which\r\nreference has already been made.\r\n\r\nBy October 13, when a stray silver-grey petrel appeared, every one was\r\non the qui vive for the coming of the penguins. In 1912 they had arrived\r\non October 12, and as there was much floating ice on the northern\r\nhorizon, we wondered if their migration to land had been impeded.\r\n\r\nThe winds were very high for the ensuing two days, and on the 17th the\r\nhorizon was clearer and more \"water sky\" was visible. Before lunch\r\non that day there was not a living thing along the steep, overhanging\r\nice-foot, but by the late afternoon thirteen birds had effected a\r\nlanding, and those who were not resting after their long swim were\r\nhopping about making a survey of the nearest rookeries. One always has\r\na \"soft spot\" for these game little creatures--there is something\r\nirresistibly human about them--and, situated as we were, the wind seemed\r\nof little account now that the foreshores were to be populated by the\r\npenguins--our harbingers of summer and the good times to be. Three days\r\nlater, at the call of the season, a skua gull came flapping over the\r\nHut.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a singular circumstance that on the evening of the 17th,\r\ncoincident with the disappearance of the ice on the horizon, wireless\r\nsignals suddenly came through very strongly in the twilight at 9.30\r\nP.M., and for many succeeding nights continued at the same intensity. On\r\nthe other hand, during September, when the sea was either firmly frozen\r\nor strewn thickly with floe-ice, communication was very fitful and\r\nuncertain. The fact is therefore suggested that wireless waves are for\r\nsome reason more readily transmitted across a surface of water than\r\nacross ice.\r\n\r\nThe weather during the rest of October and for the first weeks\r\nof November took on a phase of heavy snowfalls which we knew were\r\ninevitable before summer could be really established. The winds were\r\nvery often in the \"eighties\" and every four or five days a calm might be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe penguins had a tempestuous time building their nests, and resuming\r\nonce more the quaint routine of their rookery life. In the hurricanes\r\nthey usually ceased work and crouched behind rocks until the worst was\r\nover. A great number of birds were observed to have small wounds on\r\nthe body which had bled and discoloured their feathers. In one case a\r\npenguin had escaped, presumably from a sea-leopard, with several serious\r\nwounds, and had staggered up to a rookery, dying there from loss of\r\nblood. Almost immediately the frozen carcase was mutilated and torn by\r\nskua gulls.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 31 the good news was received that the 'Aurora' would leave\r\nAustralia on November 15. There were a great number of things to be\r\npacked, including the lathe, the motor and dynamos, the air-tractor\r\nengine, the wireless \"set\" and magnetic and meteorological instruments.\r\nOutside the Hut, many cases of kerosene and provisions, which might\r\nbe required for the Ship, had been buried to a depth of twelve feet in\r\nplaces during the southeast hurricane in September. So we set to work in\r\ngreat spirits to prepare for the future.\r\n\r\nMcLean was busy collecting biological specimens, managing to secure a\r\nlarge number of parasites from penguins, skua gulls, giant petrels, snow\r\npetrels, Wilson petrels, seals and an Emperor penguin, which came up on\r\nthe harbour-ice. On several beautiful days, with a sea-breeze wafting in\r\nfrom the north, large purple and brown jelly-fish came floating to the\r\nice-foot. Many were caught in a hand-net and preserved in formalin. In\r\nhis shooting excursions McLean happened on a small rocky ravine to the\r\neast where, hovering among nests of snow and Wilson petrels, a small\r\nbluish-grey bird,* not unlike Prion Banksii, was discovered. Four\r\nspecimens were shot, and, later, several old nests were found containing\r\nthe unhatched eggs of previous years.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** On arrival in Australia this bird proved to be new to science.\r\n\r\nOn the highest point of Azimuth Hill, overlooking the sea, a Memorial\r\nCross was raised to our two lost comrades.\r\n\r\nA calm evening in November! At ten o'clock a natural picture in shining\r\ncolours is painted on the canvas of sea and sky. The northern dome is a\r\nblush of rose deepening to a warm terra-cotta along the horizon, and the\r\nwater reflects it upward to the gaze. Tiny Wilson petrels flit by like\r\nswallows; seals shove their dark forms above the placid surface; the\r\nshore is lined with penguins squatting in grotesque repose. The south is\r\npallid with light--the circling sun. Adelie Land is at peace!\r\n\r\nFor some time Madigan, Hodgeman and I had been prepared to set out on\r\na short sledging journey to visit Mount Murchison and to recover if\r\npossible the instruments cached by the Eastern Coastal and the\r\nSouthern Parties. It was not until November 23 that the weather \"broke\"\r\ndefinitely, and we started up the old glacier \"trail\" assisted by a good\r\nteam of dogs.\r\n\r\nAladdin's Cave was much the same as we had left it in the previous\r\nFebruary, except that a fine crop of delicate ice-crystals had formed on\r\nits walls. We carried with us a small home-made wireless receiving set,\r\nand arrangements were made with Bickerton and Bage to call at certain\r\nhours. As an \"aerial\" a couple of lengths of copper wire were run out\r\non the surface of the ice. At the first \"call\" Madigan heard the signals\r\nstrongly and distinctly, but beyond five and a half miles nothing more\r\nwas received.\r\n\r\nResuming the journey on the following day, we made a direct course for\r\nMadigan Nunatak and then steered southeast for Mount Murchison, pitching\r\ncamp at its summit on the night of November 28.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th Madigan and Hodgeman made a descent into the valley, on\r\nwhose southern side rose Aurora Peak. The former slid away on skis and\r\nhad a fine run to the bottom, while Hodgeman followed on the sledge\r\ndrawn by Monkey and D'Urville, braking with an ice-axe driven into\r\nthe snow between the cross-bars. Their object was to find the depot of\r\ninstruments and rocks which the Eastern Coastal Party were forced to\r\nabandon when fifty-three miles from home. They were unsuccessful in\r\nthe search, as an enormous amount of snow had fallen on the old surface\r\nduring the interval of almost a year. Indeed, on the knoll crowning\r\nMount Murchison, where a ten-foot flagpole had been left, snow had\r\naccumulated so that less than a foot of the top of the pole was\r\nshowing. Nine feet of hard compressed snow scarcely marked by one's\r\nfootsteps--the contribution of one year! To such a high isolated spot\r\ndrift-snow would not reach, so that the annual snowfall must greatly\r\nexceed the residuum found by us, for the effect of the prevailing winds\r\nwould be to reduce it greatly.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after leaving Mount Murchison for the Southern\r\nParty's depot, sixty-seven miles south of Winter Quarters, driving snow\r\ncommenced, and a blizzard kept us in camp for seven days. When the drift\r\nat last moderated we were forced to make direct for the Hut, as the time\r\nwhen the Ship was expected to arrive had passed.\r\n\r\nDescending the long blue slopes of the glacier just before midnight\r\non December 12, we became aware of a faint black bar on the seaward\r\nhorizon. Soon a black speck had moved to the windward side of the\r\nbar--and it could be nothing but the smoke of the 'Aurora'. The moment\r\nof which we had dreamt for months had assuredly come. The Ship was in\r\nsight!\r\n\r\nThere were wild cheers down at the Hut when they heard the news. They\r\ncould not believe us and immediately rushed up with glasses to the\r\nnearest ridge to get the evidence of their own senses. The masts, the\r\nfunnel and the staunch hull rose out of the ocean as we watched on the\r\nhills through the early hours of a superb morning. The sun was streaming\r\nwarmly over the plateau and a cool land breeze had sprung up from the\r\nsouth, as the 'Aurora' rounded the Mackellar Islets and steamed up to\r\nher old anchorage. We picked out familiar figures on the bridge and\r\npoop, and made a bonfire of kerosene, benzine and lubricating oil in a\r\nrocky crevice in their honour.\r\n\r\nThe indescribable moment was when Davis came ashore in the whale-boat,\r\nmanned by two of the Macquarie Islanders (Hamilton and Blake), Hurley\r\nand Hunter. They rushed into the Hut, and we tried to tell the story of\r\na year in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nOn the Ship we greeted Gillies, Gray, de la Motte, Ainsworth, Sandell\r\nand Correll. It was splendid to know that the world contained so many\r\npeople, and to see these men who had stuck to the Expedition through\r\n\"thick and thin.\" Then came the fusillade of letters, magazines and\r\n\"mysterious\" parcels and boxes. At dinner we sat down reunited in the\r\nfreshly painted ward-room, striving to collect our bewildered thoughts\r\nat the sight of a white tablecloth, Australian mutton, fresh vegetables,\r\nfruit and cigars.\r\n\r\nThe two long years were over--for the moment they were to be effaced\r\nin the glorious present. We were to live in a land where drift and wind\r\nwere unknown, where rain fell in mild, refreshing showers, where the sky\r\nwas blue for long weeks, and where the memories of the past were to fade\r\ninto a dream--a nightmare?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV LIFE ON MACQUARIE ISLAND\r\n\r\nBy G. F. Ainsworth\r\n\r\n\r\nLeft on an island in mid-ocean!\r\n\r\nIt suggests the romances of youthful days--Crusoe, Sindbad and all their\r\nglorious company. Still, when this narrative is completed, imagination\r\nwill be seen to have played a small part. In fact, it is a plain tale of\r\nour experiences, descriptive of a place where we spent nearly two years\r\nand of the work accomplished during our stay.\r\n\r\nThe island was discovered in 1810 by Captain Hasselborough of the ship\r\n'Perseverance', which had been dispatched by Campbell and Sons, of\r\nSydney, under his command to look for islands inhabited by fur seals.\r\nMacquarie Islands, named by Hasselborough after the Governor of New\r\nSouth Wales, were found to be swarming with these valuable animals, and\r\nfor two years after their discovery was made known, many vessels visited\r\nthe place, landing gangs of men to procure skins and returning at\r\nfrequent intervals to carry the proceeds of their labours to the markets\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of the seals was so great that the animals were almost\r\nexterminated within a few years. One ship is known to have left\r\nMacquarie Island with a cargo of 35,000 skins during the first year of\r\noperations. High prices were obtained for them in London and China, and\r\nmany American, British and Sydney firms were engaged in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe value of a skin is determined by the condition of the fur, which is\r\noften damaged by the animals fighting amongst themselves. Furthermore,\r\nat a certain season of the year, the seals moult, and if taken within\r\na certain time of this natural process, the skin is almost valueless.\r\nThese facts were ignored by the sealers, who killed without\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\nAgain, both male and female, old and young were ruthlessly slaughtered,\r\nwith the obvious result--the extermination of the species. If\r\nsupervision had been exercised and restrictions imposed, there is no\r\ndoubt that the island would still have been used by the fur seal as a\r\nbreeding-ground. During our stay none were seen, but Mr. Bauer, who acts\r\nas sealing herdsman and who had visited the island in that capacity each\r\nsummer for eleven years, stated that he had seen odd ones at infrequent\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nAssociated as the island has been since the year 1812 with sealing and\r\noil ventures, it follows that a history has been gradually developed;\r\nsomewhat traditional, though many occurrences to which we shall refer\r\nare well authenticated.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed from the foregoing, that a good deal is known about\r\nthe place, but such is not the case, except in a general sense. Several\r\nscientific men from New Zealand, recognizing the importance of the\r\nisland as a link between Australasia and Antarctica, visited it at\r\ndifferent times within the past twenty years, only remaining long enough\r\nto make a cursory examination of the eastern side. They had to depend\r\non the courtesy of the sealing ships' captains for a passage, and the\r\nstormy conditions which are ever prevalent made their stay too brief for\r\nany exhaustive work.\r\n\r\nA Russian Antarctic expedition, under Bellingshausen's command, called\r\nthere in 1821 and stayed for two days, collecting a few bird and animal\r\nspecimens. They referred to the island as being \"half-cooled down,\" in\r\na short but interesting account of their visit, and remarked upon the\r\nlarge number of sea-elephants lying on the shores.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the ship 'Peacock', one of the exploring vessels of the American\r\nExpedition under Wilkes, landed several men after much difficulty on the\r\nsouth-west of the island, but they remained only a few hours, returning\r\nto their ship after securing some specimens of birds. Expressing\r\nastonishment at the \"myriad of birds\", they remarked, \"Macquarie Islands\r\noffer no inducement for a visit, and as far as our examination showed,\r\nhave no suitable place for landing with a boat.\"\r\n\r\nThe next call of an Antarctic expedition was made by Captain Scott in\r\nthe 'Discovery' in November 1901. He, with several naturalists, landed\r\non the eastern side to collect specimens, but remained only a few hours.\r\nHe refers to the penguins, kelp-weed and tussock grass; certainly three\r\ncharacteristic features.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis, during his search for charted sub-antarctic islands, when\r\nconnected with Sir Ernest Shackleton's expedition, called there in\r\nthe 'Nimrod' in 1909. He landed a party of men who secured several\r\nsea-elephants and some penguins.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that very little had been done which was\r\nscientifically important or generally interesting. Sealers came and went\r\nas a matter of business, and probably the arduous nature of their work\r\nand the rugged topography of the island combined to prevent the more\r\ncurious from exploring far afield.\r\n\r\nCaptain Scott was desirous of establishing a base on Macquarie Island\r\nin 1910, but circumstances compelled him to abandon the idea. And so it\r\ncame that we five men of Dr. Mawson's Expedition were landed on December\r\n22, 1911, with a programme of work outlined by our leader. H. Hamilton\r\nwas biologist, L. R. Blake surveyor and geologist, C. A. Sandell and A.\r\nJ. Sawyer were wireless operators, the former being also a mechanic, and\r\nI was appointed meteorologist and leader of the party.\r\n\r\nWe stood on the beach in the dusk, watching the boat's party struggle\r\nback to the 'Aurora', which lay at anchor one and a half miles from\r\nthe north-west shore. Having received a soaking landing in the surf and\r\nbeing tired out with the exertions of the day, we started back to our\r\ntemporary shelter. We had not gone very far when a mysterious sound,\r\nfollowed by a shaking of the earth, made us glance at each other and\r\nexclaim, \"An earthquake!\" The occurrence gave rise to a discussion which\r\ncarried us to bed.\r\n\r\nSeeing that we were to spend a long time on the island, the question of\r\nbuilding a hut was the first consideration. Through the kindness of Mr.\r\nBauer, who had just left the island in the s.s. 'Toroa', we were able to\r\nlive for the time being in the sealers' hut.\r\n\r\nIt was urgent to get the wireless station into working order as soon as\r\npossible. The masts and operating-hut had been erected during the stay\r\nof the 'Aurora', but there yet remained the building of the engine-hut\r\nand the installation of the machinery and instruments, as well as the\r\nconstruction and erection of the aerial. Accordingly we proceeded with\r\nthe living-hut and the job on Wireless Hill at the same time, working on\r\nthe hill most of the day and at the hut in the evening.\r\n\r\nWireless Hill rose to three hundred and fifty feet in height, and formed\r\npart of a peninsula running in a northeasterly direction from the\r\nmain island. It had been chosen by Mr. Hannam of the Adelie Land party\r\nbecause of its open northerly aspect, and because \"wireless\" waves\r\nwould probably have a good \"set-off,\" southward to the Main Base in\r\nAntarctica.\r\n\r\nJust a few yards from the base of the hill on its southwestern side was\r\na huge rock, upon the easterly side of which we decided to build our\r\ndwelling. The timbers for the hut had been cut and fitted in Hobart, so\r\nall that remained for us was to put them together.\r\n\r\nAfter working at high pressure until December 30, we were able to\r\nestablish ourselves in a home. The doorway faced to the east, and the\r\nrock protected the small place from the strong westerly weather which\r\nis invariable in these latitudes. The dimensions were twenty feet by\r\nthirteen feet, the front wall being nine feet six inches high, sloping\r\nto seven feet six inches at the back. All the timbers were of oregon and\r\ndeal, and particular attention was paid to bracing and strengthening\r\nthe building, which rested on piles just clear of the sandy surface.\r\nThe inside was lined and ceiled, and the roof of galvanized iron was set\r\nflush with the front wall, fascia boards along the front and sides being\r\ndesigned to keep the fine snow from blowing under the corrugations and\r\nlodging on the ceiling. \"George V Villa\" was fixed upon as the name, but\r\nthe hut was never at any time referred to as the villa, and in future\r\nwill always be known as the Shack.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nPlan of Hut--Macquarie Island\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve live sheep had been landed, and these had been driven on to\r\nWireless Hill so as to be accessible. We decided to kill one for\r\nChristmas, so on December 24 Sandell and I, leaving the others at work\r\non the Shack, started out.\r\n\r\nThe hillsides are deeply ravined and the slopes covered with a dense\r\ngrowth of tussock, which renders progress uncertain and laborious. Our\r\nexperience was a foretaste of many to come. We found the sheep huddled\r\ntogether in a deep gully on the eastern side, and drove them round to\r\nthe front of the hill, where one was caught, killed and dressed.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day dawned fine and sunny, and we decided to make some attempt\r\nat a dinner. Blake produced a plum pudding, and this, together with\r\nroast mutton and several kinds of vegetables, washed down with a little\r\nclaret, constituted our first Christmas dinner.\r\n\r\nThe sealing schooner, Clyde, had been wrecked without loss of life on\r\nNovember 14, 1911, on the east coast, and was now lying on the beach\r\nnearly half a mile away. A two-hundred-gallon tank had been saved\r\nfrom the wreck and we managed on Christmas morning, after two hours of\r\ncarrying and trundling, to place it at the end of the Shack. This was a\r\nvaluable find, ensuring in the future a constant, convenient supply\r\nof rain water. Further, we made use of the timber of the wreck for\r\nbuilding, and the broken pieces strewn about were stored up as firewood.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th we all went to the wireless station, and, as Sandell had the\r\naerial made, we pulled it into position. In the afternoon I unpacked\r\nall my instruments and started them off so as to make sure that all\r\nwere working correctly. I did not intend to record any observations till\r\nJanuary 1, 1912, and therefore did not erect the meteorological screen\r\nuntil the 28th.\r\n\r\nOn moving into our abode domestic arrangements were made. With regard\r\nto cooking, each man took duty for a week, during which he was able to\r\nwrite up his work and to wash and mend clothes. To Hamilton and Sandell,\r\nwho had had previous experience, frequent appeals were made as to\r\nmethods of cooking various dishes, but by degrees each one asserted his\r\nindependence. There were several cookery books for reference and each\r\nweek saw the appearance of some new pudding, in each instance prefaced\r\nby the boast: \"This is going to be the best pudding ever turned out on\r\nthe island!\" The promise was not always made good.\r\n\r\nWe had a good deal of difficulty at first in making bread and several\r\nbatches were very \"heavy\" failures. This difficulty, however, was soon\r\novercome and, after the first few months, the cooking standard was high\r\nand well maintained. Our stove was very small and only two loaves of\r\nbread could be cooked at once. It frequently happened, therefore, that\r\nthe others, which would go on rising in the tins, overflowed; a matter\r\nwhich could only be set right by experience.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day, 1912, we carried timber in relays from the wreck to\r\nthe top of Wireless Hill, so that the building of the engine-hut could\r\nbe started. The next few days were occupied in getting food-stuffs,\r\nmedicines, stationery, clothing and other necessaries over to the Shack\r\nfrom the landing-place on the beach. Blake and Hamilton unpacked\r\ntheir instruments and appliances, fitting up a small laboratory and\r\nphotographic dark-room in one corner of the hut.\r\n\r\nSome kind Hobart friend had sent four fowls to me on the day of sailing,\r\nrequesting me to take them to Macquarie island. They were housed in one\r\nof the meteorological screens, but on the third day from Hobart a heavy\r\nsea broke on board, upset the temporary fowl-house and crushed the\r\nrooster's head. The three hens were landed safely and appeared to be\r\nthoroughly reconciled to their strange surroundings, though the presence\r\nof so many large birds soaring about overhead had a terrifying effect on\r\nthem for several days. They did not appear to pick up much food amongst\r\nthe grass, but scratched away industriously all the same. I must say\r\nthat they were very friendly and gave the place quite a homely aspect.\r\nOne of them was christened \"Ma\" on account of her maternal and somewhat\r\nfussy disposition.\r\n\r\nOn the first Sunday in the new year all except myself went along\r\nthe coast towards West Point. The party reported immense numbers of\r\nsea-elephants, especially young ones. They also saw many wekas and three\r\nducks, shooting nine of the former for the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe wekas or Maori hens are small, flightless birds, averaging when\r\nfull grown about two and three-quarter pounds. They were introduced\r\ntwenty-five years ago by Mr. Elder, of New Zealand, a former lessee of\r\nthe island, and multiplied so fast that they are now very numerous. They\r\nlive among the tussocks, and subsist for the most part upon the larvae\r\nof the kelp-fly, small fish and other marine life which they catch under\r\nthe stones along the rocky shores at low tide. They are exceedingly\r\ninquisitive and pugnacious and may easily be caught by hand.\r\n\r\nUsually, when disturbed, they will pop under a rock, and on being seized\r\nimmediately commence to squeak. This is sufficient to bring every weka\r\nwithin a quarter of a mile hurrying to the spot, and, in a few minutes,\r\nheads may be seen poking out of the grass in every direction. The man\r\nholding the bird then crouches down, preferably just on the border of\r\nthe tussock, holding the protesting bird in one hand. Soon there will be\r\na rustle, then a rush, and another furious weka will attack the decoy.\r\nThe newcomer is grabbed and, if the birds are plentiful, five or six of\r\nthem may be taken in one spot.\r\n\r\nTheir call is peculiarly plaintive and wild and may be heard night and\r\nday. Though we saw and caught innumerable young ones of all sizes, we\r\nwere never able to find the nests of these Maori hens.\r\n\r\nA depot of stores had been laid by the 'Aurora' at Caroline Cove, twenty\r\nmiles from the Shack at the south end of the island, and it was deemed\r\nadvisable to lay several more intermediate food-depots along the east\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe sealers had a motor-launch which they kindly placed at our disposal,\r\nand a supply of stores was put on board for transport. At 8 A.M.,\r\nJanuary 9, Sandell, Blake, Sawyer and Hamilton started out accompanied\r\nby two sealers who offered to point out the positions of several old\r\nhuts along the coast. These huts had been built by sealing gangs many\r\nyears ago and were in a sad state of disrepair.\r\n\r\nThe first call was made at Sandy Bay, about five miles from the Shack.\r\nStores were landed and placed in the hut, and the party proceeded to\r\nLusitania Bay, eleven miles farther on, where they stayed for the night.\r\nAt this place (named after an old sealing craft, the 'Lusitania') there\r\nwere two huts, one being a work-hut and the other a living-hut. They had\r\nnot been used for sixteen years and, as a result, were found to be much\r\ndilapidated. In the locality is a large King penguin rookery, the only\r\none on the island, and two dozen eggs were obtained on this visit, some\r\nfresh and some otherwise.\r\n\r\nAs the next morning was squally, it was decided that the stores should\r\nbe deposited in the hut at the south end; a distance of five miles\r\nacross country. Through bog and tussock it took the party four hours to\r\naccomplish this journey. The hut was found in the same condition as the\r\nothers and a rather miserable night was spent. A short distance from\r\nthis spot is situated the largest penguin rookery on the island. On\r\nreturning to the launch, the six men had a quick run of three hours back\r\nto the north end.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the party I had been busy erecting a stand for the\r\nanemo-biagraph. Ordinarily, such an instrument is kept in a house, the\r\nupper section only being exposed through the roof. The Shack was in\r\na position too sheltered for my purpose, so I built a place for the\r\nanemo-biagraph behind a low rock well out on the isthmus.\r\n\r\nSandell and Sawyer reported on the 16th that the wireless station was\r\nready for testing. Therefore, on the following day, the three of us\r\nerected a small set on the farthest point of the peninsula--North Head.\r\nThe set had been made in order to test the large station. Sawyer then\r\nreturned to the operating-hut and received signals sent from North Head\r\nby Sandell, who in return received Sawyer's signals, thus showing that\r\nso far everything was satisfactory. It was thought, after the tests,\r\nthat the \"earth\" was not by any means good and Sawyer erected a\r\ncounterpoise, which, however, failed to give anything like the \"earth\"\r\nresults. More \"earths\" (connexions by wire with the ground) were now\r\nput in from day to day, and on the 27th Sawyer noted an improvement.\r\nSuccessful tests were again made on the 30th. The wireless men now\r\nexpected communication with Australia.\r\n\r\nBlake and Hamilton were soon making inroads, each on his own particular\r\nsphere of work. On the 17th a baseline was laid down on the plateau, and\r\nBlake was able to commence his survey of the island. He had already made\r\nsome geological investigations in the vicinity of North Head and West\r\nPoint, as well as for a short distance along the east coast. Hamilton\r\nhad visited nearly all the penguin rookeries in the vicinity, and\r\nalready had several fine specimens. Marine collecting occupied part of\r\nhis time and plant life promised to provide an interesting field.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nThe north end of Macquarie Island\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the intermediate position that Macquarie Island occupies relative\r\nto Australasia and the Antarctic continent, it was highly important that\r\nits biology should be fully determined. Investigation of the marine and\r\nterrestrial fauna and flora shows several facts indicating the part this\r\nisland has played in the supposed connexion of the great land masses of\r\nthe southern hemispheres. It is an established fact that the flora of\r\nNew Zealand has strong sub-antarctic and South American affinities and\r\nthe problem is to account for this distribution. Many forms of plant and\r\nanimal life are circumaustral, being found in all suitable sub-antarctic\r\nsituations. To account for this fact two theories have been advanced,\r\nnamely, the Relict theory (Dahl, Schenck and others) and the Antarctic\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe first theory supposes that the inhabitants of the sub-antarctic\r\nislands are the remnants of groups of animals developed in some northern\r\nland-mass, and driven south by more highly developed forms. Again, that\r\nthese sub-antarctic islands have always been separated from continents,\r\nand that the distribution of life on the former must have proceeded over\r\nwide stretches of sea.\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic theory accounts for the distribution and similarity of\r\nsub-antarctic fauna and flora by establishing a connexion between the\r\nsub-antarctic islands and the Antarctic continent. At the same period,\r\nthe Antarctic continent was assumed to be connected by land with South\r\nAmerica, South Africa and Australia, and the similar life forms now\r\nfound in these continents were driven northward by a subsequent colder\r\nperiod. This theory is strengthened by several facts, chief of\r\nwhich are, (1) the existence of an Antarctic continent, and (2) the\r\ncomparatively shallow waters between it, South Africa, Australia and\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nWhichever theory is adopted, it is evident that our scientific\r\nopportunities were unique.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, Sandell, Sawyer and I decided to climb on to the main ridge\r\nor plateau of the island. We had already discovered that the easiest\r\nway to get on to the hills was to follow up one of the many ravines or\r\ngullies which run down to the sea. This necessitates walking in water\r\nmost of the way, but one soon gets accustomed to wet feet on Macquarie\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThe slopes rise in a series of terraces which are generally soggy and\r\ncovered with tussock (pleurophyllum) and with scattered cushions of\r\nAzorella. The summit of the ridge is a barren waste, over which loose\r\nrocks are scattered in every direction, while a wavy effect due to the\r\naction of wind is plainly visible over the surface of the ground. The\r\nsteep, descending sides are very soft and sodden, supporting a scanty\r\ngrowth of vegetation, including the small burr known as the \"biddy-bid.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of tarns and lakes are visible along the plateau-like ridge\r\nwhich extends throughout the length of the island. Several of the lakes\r\nare half a mile long and very deep. The tarns are, for the most part,\r\nshallow with hard stony bottoms. The water is beautifully fresh and\r\napparently contains no life.\r\n\r\nSkua gulls were plentiful and washed themselves, with a great flapping\r\nof wings, in the shallow waters at the edge of the lakes. They paid\r\nparticular attention to our dog \"Mac,\" swooping down and attempting to\r\nstrike her with their wings. A yelp at intervals came from Mac if they\r\nwere successful, though the former, if she were quick enough, would\r\nspring at the bird and retaliate by getting a mouthful of feathers.\r\n\r\nWe eventually came out on to a point about seven hundred feet high,\r\noverlooking the west coast, and it could be seen that the space between\r\nthe base of the hills and the ocean was occupied by a plain which sloped\r\nvery gradually to the beach. Here and there across its surface were huge\r\nmounds of earth and rock and, occasionally, a small lakelet fringed with\r\na dense growth of tussock and Maori cabbage.\r\n\r\nA descent was made to explore the place. A fairly large volume of water\r\nflowed rapidly downward by several deep gullies and, coming to the\r\nterrace, cut narrow, sinuous channels which were soon lost to view in\r\nthe tussocks. Examination of the watercourses revealed that this tract\r\nwas simply a raised beach covered with sodden peat and carrying a rather\r\ncoarse vegetation. The ground was decidedly springy and shook to\r\nour tread; moreover, one sank down over the ankles at each step.\r\nOccasionally a more insecure area was encountered, where one of us would\r\ngo down to the thighs in the boggy ground.\r\n\r\nAs the shore approached we came to thick tussock and Maori cabbage, and\r\nthe travelling became much rougher. A group of earthy mounds and rock\r\nwas sighted some distance away and we decided to reach them and have\r\nour lunch. A nearer view showed us a large opening in one of these\r\nprominences and we scrambled up to examine it.\r\n\r\nInside there was a small cave, high in front but sloping sharply towards\r\nthe back for a distance of thirty-five feet. The roof and walls were\r\nblackened by smoke, and spikes and nails driven into crevices were\r\nevidences that the place had once been occupied. Eagle Cave it is called\r\nand its story was afterwards related to us.\r\n\r\nBetween thirty and forty years ago the schooner 'Eagle', in attempting\r\nto make the island, had been caught in a gale and wrecked on the\r\nrock-bound western coast. As far as can be learned, there were nine men\r\nand a woman on board, all of whom were saved. They lived in this cave\r\nfor almost two years, subsisting upon what they could catch. Decayed\r\ntussock grass, a foot in depth, now covers the floor, showing that some\r\nattempt had been made to improve the comfort of the place, while bones\r\nlying strewn about in all directions indicate that gulls, penguins and\r\ncormorants must have supplied a good deal of their food. It is presumed\r\nthat some of them made a journey to North Head periodically to look out\r\nfor relief, as a well-defined track to that point is still visible in\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe tale, however, has its tragic side, for the woman died on the very\r\nday when the rescuing ship called at the island. She was buried on the\r\nisthmus, not far from our Shack. One would think that death was rather\r\na relief from such an existence as this unfortunate woman must have\r\nendured, but, at the same time, it seems hard that she did not live to\r\nparticipate in the joy of deliverance.\r\n\r\nWe ate our lunch and had a smoke, after which we decided to walk\r\nhomewards along \"Feather Bed\" terrace. A few minutes after leaving the\r\ncave, Sawyer and Sandell caught three young ducks, which they carried\r\nback, intending to rear them, but they died several days later. A weary\r\ntramp brought us, thoroughly tired, to the Shack, where Hamilton had an\r\nexcellent meal awaiting us.\r\n\r\nThe weather during January was rather trying. Precipitation in the\r\nform of either rain, hail, sleet or snow occurred on twenty-six days,\r\nsometimes all forms being experienced on the same day. As a result, the\r\nsupply of water was well maintained; in fact, the amount caught exceeded\r\nthe consumption and we finished the month with the tank almost full.\r\nGales were experienced on eight days, the maximum wind-force being\r\nforty-two miles an hour. The sky was mostly heavily clouded or\r\nabsolutely overcast and on many days the sun was not seen. Fog hung\r\nabout the hills almost continuously, and driving mist accompanied the\r\nnortherly winds.\r\n\r\nJanuary 24 was a glorious day, calm and sunny, with a maximum\r\ntemperature of 51.3 degrees F. The habit of former days induced Sandell\r\nand myself to have a dip in the surf, but as the temperature of the\r\nwater was about 42 degrees F., we stayed in as many seconds. The mean\r\ntemperature for the month was 44.9 degrees F.; the minimum being 35.5\r\ndegrees F.\r\n\r\nMy first view of the island when the 'Aurora' arrived in December 1911\r\nleft rather an agreeable impression. The day of our approach was marked\r\nby fine calm weather and the dark-green tussock-clad hillsides were\r\nrather attractive. On the other hand, one was immediately struck with\r\nthe entire absence of trees, the steep precipices, cliffs and the\r\nexceedingly rugged nature of the coastline.\r\n\r\nCloser scrutiny shows that the tussock grass radiates closely from a\r\nsemi-decayed mass of leaf-sheaths, with the blades of grass shooting\r\nupwards and outwards as high as three or four feet. Scattered through it\r\nare patches of Stilbocarpa polaris, locally known as Maori cabbage. It\r\nis of a more vivid green than the tussock and is edible, though somewhat\r\nstringy and insipid. Our sheep ate it readily, even nibbling the roots\r\nafter the plant had been cropped down.\r\n\r\nThere were several Victoria penguin colonies round about the rocky faces\r\nof the hills in the vicinity of the Shack, and their hubbub and cackling\r\nuproar were something to remember. The rearing of the young appeared to\r\nbe rather a busy process. The young ones look like bundles of down and\r\nseem to grow at a remarkable rate, while the attempt of the parent to\r\nshelter the usual two chicks is a very ludicrous thing to watch.\r\n\r\nThe material for the nest made by these birds seems to depend almost\r\nentirely on its immediate surroundings. The rookery is established on a\r\nbroken rocky face close to the water's edge and the nests are made under\r\nrocks, in niches and passages, as well as amongst the tussock growing on\r\nthe rocks. Those under the rocks are constructed of small stones and\r\na few blades of grass, while those in the passages and fissures are\r\nusually depressions in soft mud. Amongst the tussock a hole is first\r\nmade in the soft earth and then neatly lined with blades of grass.\r\n\r\nThe birds lay two or three eggs of a white or greenish-white colour, but\r\nI have never seen three chicks hatched. The eggs are edible, and we used\r\nmany dozens of them during our stay.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is about five weeks, and male and female take\r\nturns at sitting. A young one is fed by placing its beak within that\r\nof the parent bird where the food--mainly crustaceans--is taken as it\r\nregurgitates from the stomach of the latter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the smallest species on the island, the Victoria penguins are\r\nthe most spiteful, and a scramble through the rookery invites many pecks\r\nand much disturbance. They have a black head and back, white breast and\r\nyellow crest, the feathers of which spread out laterally. During the\r\nmoulting season they sit in the rookery or perched on surrounding rocks,\r\nliving apparently on their fat, which is found to have disappeared\r\nwhen at last they take to the sea. They come and go with remarkable\r\nregularity, being first seen about the middle of October, and leaving\r\nduring the first week of May. The same rookeries are occupied year after\r\nyear, and the departure of the birds adds to the general desolation\r\nduring the winter months.\r\n\r\nTheir destination on leaving the land is still a mystery. Although they\r\nare never seen, it is conjectured that they spend the winter at\r\nsea. Their natural enemy in the waters round Macquarie Island is the\r\nsea-leopard, and the stomachs of all specimens of this animal taken by\r\nus during the penguin season contained feathers.\r\n\r\nThe presence of numerous bones just at the rear of the Shack pointed to\r\nthe fact that here must have been at one time the site of a King penguin\r\nrookery. As many of our potatoes and onions were sprouting in the\r\nbags, I determined to dig a portion of this area and plant the most\r\n\"progressive\" of these vegetables. The sandy soil did not appear to\r\ncontain much nutriment, but I thought that something might be gained by\r\ngiving it a trial.\r\n\r\nOn the night of February 2, Sawyer reported that he had heard the\r\nWellington wireless operator calling Suva station, but, as no further\r\nsignals were heard from anywhere, he was inclined to the idea that it\r\nwas the experience of a \"freak night.\" In explanation of this term, I\r\nmay say that it is used in reference to nights on which the atmospheric\r\nconditions are abnormally favourable for wireless work.\r\n\r\nThe news was particularly encouraging, and for the next few days we were\r\non the tip-toe of expectation.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning of the 5th a howling gale sprang up and, increasing\r\nin force as the day wore on, rendered work impossible. A tremendous sea\r\nworked up, and the ocean for a distance of a mile from shore was simply\r\na seething boil of foam. Huge waves dashed on shore, running yards\r\nbeyond the usual marks, and threatening to sweep across the isthmus.\r\nMasses of tangled kelp, torn from the outlying rocks, washed backwards\r\nand forwards in the surf or were carried high up among the tussocks. The\r\nconfiguration of the shingly beach changed while one looked at it. The\r\ntops of the waves could be seen flying over Anchor Rock, seventy feet\r\nhigh, and spray was blowing right across the isthmus.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of the sealers we had shifted our stores farther back from\r\nthe beach and it was just as well we did so, as the waves reached to\r\nwithin a few feet of the nearest box. Meanwhile I began to wonder how\r\nour benzine and lubricating oil were faring. Both had been stacked in\r\ncases among the tussock and rocks, well back from the waters of Aerial\r\nCove on the western side of Wireless Hill.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Hamilton, Sandell and I went round in that direction the\r\nfollowing morning, while Sawyer made his way up to the wireless station\r\nto see if there were any damages there. We worked along round the\r\ncliff-front through a cave rejoicing in the name of \"Catch Me,\" from the\r\nfact that the waves rushed into it, frequently catching and thoroughly\r\nwetting any unfortunate taken off his guard. A massive rock, evidently\r\nbroken from the roof, lay right across its centre, while on either side\r\nof the obstruction were masses of greasy decaying kelp. We were \"caught\"\r\nand floundered about in the kelp while the water surged around us.\r\nArriving at the Cove, we found that several cases were missing. One\r\nwas discovered buried in kelp, and a little later we came upon a tin\r\nbattered almost out of recognition. The loss was not serious, but the\r\nprecaution was taken to shift the oil still farther back.\r\n\r\nWhile we were engaged on this task, Sawyer appeared on the front of the\r\nhill above and signalled to us that the aerial had been blown down.\r\nThe three-inch rope keeping the aerial taut had broken off close to the\r\nbridle and torn the halyard with it. It meant that some one would have\r\nto climb the mast to pass a rope through the block, and the wind was at\r\nthis time too strong for anything to be done.\r\n\r\nOn February 7, Blake and Hamilton, who had been making preparations for\r\nseveral days past, set out for Sandy Bay, intending to do some work in\r\nthat locality. Their blankets, sleeping-bag, instruments and other gear\r\nmade rather heavy swags, but they shouldered them in true Murrumbidgee\r\nstyle and tramped away.\r\n\r\nSandell, Sawyer and I went up Wireless Hill to fix the aerial. Sandell,\r\nthe lightest of the three, was being hoisted up the first section of the\r\nmast with some one-and-a-half-inch rope when the hauling-line gave way.\r\nFortunately, he had a strap securing him to the mast, otherwise his fall\r\nwould have been from twenty feet. This was the only rope we had, so\r\nwe had to think of some other means of reaching the top. After a short\r\ndiscussion, I suggested that decking-spikes should be secured from the\r\nwreck of the Clyde and driven into the mast at intervals. The idea was\r\nfollowed with great success, and Sandell was able to run the halyard\r\nthrough the block at the top (ninety feet). The aerial was then hauled\r\ninto position, the stay-wires were tightened, an extra \"dead man\" was\r\nput in and the station was once more ready for work.\r\n\r\nHamilton returned from Sandy Bay on the 11th laden with botanical\r\ntrophies and four specimens of a small land bird which we had never\r\nbefore seen. He and Blake, who remained behind, had fixed up the hut\r\nthere so that it afforded decent shelter.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 13th what we had long expected happened. Wireless\r\ncommunication was established for the first time, with a ship--s.s.\r\n'Ulimaroa'. Sandell and Sawyer were complimented on their success.\r\n\r\nOn the following night communication was held with Sydney, s.s.\r\n'Westralia', s.s. 'Ulimaroa' and H.M.S. 'Drake'; the latter very\r\ncourteously sending us time-signals. We heard that a wireless station\r\nhad just been established in Melbourne, and that the Hobart station\r\nwould be working in about one month. It was with the latter station that\r\nwe expected to do most of our business. There was great joy in the camp\r\nnow that this stage of practical efficiency was reached and because we\r\nwere no longer isolated from the world.\r\n\r\nBlake came back from Sandy Bay on the 16th with news that he had almost\r\nfinished the survey of that section. Foggy or misty weather gave him\r\na good deal of trouble in getting sights with the theodolite, and it\r\nbecame part of his future programme to devote the \"impossible\" days\r\nto plotting data, writing up field-notes, and making geological\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon of the 17th was fine, and I went along the beach\r\ntowards West Point and found it very rough travelling. Hundreds of sea\r\nelephants, mostly of the season's young, lay about in the tussock or\r\namongst the rocks. The young, silver-grey in colour, looked very sleek\r\nand fat. The adults consorted in groups of from eight to ten, packed\r\nclosely and fast asleep. They seemed to fairly luxuriate in a soft,\r\nswampy place and were packed like sardines in some of the wallows.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of skua gulls, creating a dreadful din, drew my attention\r\nto a spot amongst the rocks, and, on nearing it, I found them squabbling\r\naround the carcase of a xiphoid whale, about sixteen feet long, which\r\nhad been cast up apparently only a few hours before.\r\n\r\nThe skuas, as they are commonly called, are large brown birds which\r\nresort to the island in great numbers for the purpose of breeding.\r\nThey stay longer than any other migrant, being absent only three months\r\nduring the depth of winter. Returning early in August, they do not start\r\nnesting until the beginning of October. The nests, nicely made of grass\r\nand plant leaves, are generally built on the terraces and slopes amongst\r\nthe hills. The ideal site, however, is a pleurophyllum flat adjoining a\r\npenguin rookery. Two or three eggs of a brown or greenish-brown colour\r\nwith darker spots or blotches are laid about the end of October, and,\r\nfrom this time till the chicks are reared, the parent exhibits much\r\nannoyance at the presence of any person in the vicinity. They utter\r\nshrill cries and swoop down continuously in an attempt to strike the\r\ninvader with their wings. Several of our party received black eyes as a\r\nresult of attacks by skuas.\r\n\r\nThe young grow rather quickly, and not much time elapses before they\r\nleave the nest to stagger round and hide amongst the vegetation. The\r\nparents fly down and disgorge food, which is immediately devoured by\r\nthe young ones. The skuas are bare-faced robbers and most rapacious,\r\nharassing the penguins in particular. They steal the eggs and young of\r\nthe latter and devour a great number of prions--small birds which live\r\nin holes in the ground. The skuas are web-footed, but are very rarely\r\nseen in the water.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month, Blake spent two days at Sandy Bay and then\r\nreturned to work up his results.\r\n\r\nHamilton, in order to get into close touch with another species of\r\npenguin, stayed several days at \"The Nuggets,\" two and a half miles down\r\nthe eastern coast. A creek flows into the sea at this point, and many\r\nRoyal penguin rookeries are established along its course.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, many improvements had been effected in the interior of the\r\nShack. Shelves lined the walls wherever it was convenient to have them,\r\nand many perishable foodstuffs had been brought inside. Comfort, after\r\nall, is but a relative matter, and, as far as we were concerned, it was\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nOur clothing was all that could be desired, with the exception, perhaps,\r\nof the boots. In the equipment were included one pair of sea-boots, one\r\npair of raw hide kneeboots and two pairs of rawhide hunting boots. The\r\nlatter were not heavy enough, and soon showed the effect of travelling\r\nfrom a water-logged surface to one of rock and vice versa. In fact, our\r\nboots were very rarely dry on Macquarie Island.\r\n\r\nAn event of some moment occurred on the 28th. The fowls, in order to\r\njustify our confidence in them and as a return for our constant care,\r\ncommenced to lay and, strange to say, all began to lay at the same time.\r\nMa, who was greatly concerned during the turn of affairs, suffered from\r\nprolonged attacks of cackling.\r\n\r\nDuring the opening days of March, Blake and Hamilton were engaged in\r\nfield work down the island. They went as far as \"The Brothers,\" a rocky\r\npromontory about two miles south of Sandy Bay. Wekas were so plentiful\r\nthat they lived almost entirely on them. Blake, on returning to the\r\nShack, had a badly blistered heel which kept him indoors for a few days.\r\nHamilton, who had secured a goodly number of specimens, had to attend\r\nimmediately to their preservation.\r\n\r\nThere were many rats on the island and we frequently heard them\r\nscuttling about on the ceiling of the Shack and slithering down between\r\nthe lining and the wall. Hitherto they had contented themselves by doing\r\nthis, but on the night of the 7th several of them flopped one after\r\nanother into the hut, awakening the inmates. On getting out to\r\ninvestigate I found a hole through the lining, about seven feet from the\r\nfloor, and two or three were rustling about on the shelves. After much\r\nshifting of boxes and searching behind tins, the intruders were killed.\r\n\r\nOn March 10 our station held communication with Suva at a distance\r\nof two thousand four hundred miles; a remarkable performance for a\r\none-and-a-half-kilowatt wireless set.\r\n\r\nHamilton and I set out for West Point and Eagle Cave on the 11th with\r\nthe object of examining the flora of the locality and, incidentally, to\r\nshoot ducks which frequent the pools on the \"Feather Bed\" terrace. The\r\nweather was dull and misty and the walk very uncomfortable. We made our\r\nway across this treacherous tract, often sinking kneedeep. As we neared\r\nthe first pool a duck rose and immediately paid the penalty. Although\r\nwe saw at least two hundred, only one was shot, owing to the fact that\r\nthere is no cover about and the ducks are too easily scared.\r\n\r\nClose to Eagle Cave Hamilton gathered some plant specimens and, after\r\nlunching, we set off home. Light, steady rain set in about 3 P.M.\r\nand wet us thoroughly. We travelled back along the coast, finding it\r\nfearfully rough but not so tiring as walking on the terrace.\r\n\r\nHeavy snow fell during the night of the 11th. Among other things we\r\nlearnt by wireless that Amundsen had returned to Hobart with the news\r\nthat he had reached the South Pole.\r\n\r\nBlake had just recovered from his blistered heel when he had the\r\nmisfortune to meet with a slight accident. He and Hamilton were engaged\r\ncutting a track through the tussock from the Shack to the beach, when\r\nthe spade wielded by Hamilton struck Blake's foot, cutting through\r\nthe boot and inflicting a wound on the great toe. It was treated\r\nantiseptically and bound up; Blake being laid up for a few days.\r\n\r\nCooking was still on the up grade. Everybody, as his turn arrived,\r\nembarked on something new. Blake turned out a magnificent meat pudding\r\nduring his week, and Sawyer manufactured a salmon kedgeree. Sandell's\r\ntreacle pudding and Hamilton's soda rolls and date pudding were all\r\nequally good, while I fairly surpassed myself with a roly-poly and some\r\npancakes.\r\n\r\nHitherto, Sawyer and Sandell had been coming down to the Shack each\r\nnight after finishing the wireless work, but on account of the bad\r\nweather they determined to sleep up there and, with that end in view,\r\neach built a bunk for himself; Sawyer, in the operating-hut, had\r\nample room for the improvement, but Sandell had more difficulty in\r\nthe engine-hut, finding it necessary to add a small structure to the\r\noriginal one.\r\n\r\nGood wireless work was now being done, and almost every ship trading\r\nto eastern Australian ports gave us a \"call up.\" Much difficulty was\r\nexperienced with the mast's stays, which frequently required tightening\r\non account of the \"deadmen\" working loose in the yielding peaty soil.\r\nThere were seven stays required for each mast, and Sandell spent much\r\ntime in attending to them.\r\n\r\nHamilton had found, some weeks previously, several nests of the sooty\r\nalbatross along the cliff-front on the eastern side of Wireless Hill,\r\nand on the 21st he visited them for the purpose of photographing the\r\nyoung in the nest. They were still in the downy stage, and vomited\r\nvigorously on being approached.\r\n\r\nThese birds build their nests on ledges along the face of a steep cliff\r\nand always betray the whereabouts of their nesting-place by wheeling\r\nand soaring around the vicinity. When sitting, the bird utters piercing\r\ncalls for its mate and is thereby easily located. They make a nest of\r\ngrass, generally at the root of a tussock growing on the cliff-front,\r\nand when the building is in progress the two birds sit side by side\r\nentwining their necks, rubbing beaks and at intervals uttering their\r\nharsh cries. One can approach and catch them quite easily, either at\r\nthis time or when sitting. The female lays one large white egg, which\r\nhas a peculiar and rather disagreeable odour. They have beautiful slaty\r\nor bluish-gray plumage with a dark soot-black head, while encircling\r\nthe eye is a white ring which stands out conspicuously from the dark\r\nfeathers surrounding it. Like most other sea-birds they have the rather\r\nrevolting habit of vomiting quantities of partly digested food and fluid\r\nwhen an attempt is made to get close to them. In this respect old and\r\nyoung are alike. Their food is procured at sea, and consists of the\r\nsmall forms of marine life.\r\n\r\nSandell and Hamilton went round to Aerial Cove on the 25th to collect\r\nshells and to search for the missing lubricating oil. When coming home,\r\nafter a successful day, they discovered a cave quite close to Catch Me.\r\nA lantern was secured from the Shack and they went back to examine it.\r\nIt penetrated for a considerable distance and opened out on the hill\r\nside about eighty feet above sea-level. Many rocks hung down from\r\noverhead, and altogether it appeared a very unsafe place. Blake went\r\nalong later and collected specimens from its floor.\r\n\r\nWe built a kind of annex to the Shack out of the cases of provisions;\r\neach case being numbered and a list being drawn out setting forth the\r\ncontents of the case. This list was nailed on to the wall inside, and\r\nbesides being convenient for procuring the provisions, gave the cook, in\r\na coup-d'oeil, exact information and afforded him a glorious scope.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the coal-supply, our allowance at Macquarie Island had\r\nbeen reduced by one-half, on account of the large amount of wreckage\r\nlying on the beach. The weekly cook limited himself to three briquettes,\r\nand these he supplemented with sea elephant blubber and wood, which he\r\ngathered and cut up for use.\r\n\r\nEach man commenced his cooking week on Saturday morning, and continued\r\nuntil the following Friday night, when, after having cleared up, washed\r\nthe towels and cleaned the stove, he retired. The incoming cook, who for\r\nhalf an hour had been prowling about keenly observant of \"overlooked\"\r\ndirty \"things\" and betraying every sign of impatience to make a start,\r\nproceeded at once to set a batch of bread, sufficient for one week,\r\nwhich was baked early on Saturday morning. Five loaves had to be baked,\r\nand as only two could be dealt with at a time, the chance of producing\r\nat least one doughy loaf was reasonably high until every one became a\r\nmaster baker.\r\n\r\nFor a time we had been rather hard put to it in the matter of having\r\nbaths, but the disability had been overcome by means of sawing a cask in\r\ntwo; an expedient which answered very well. The bath was also used as\r\na wash-tub, each man taking charge as his cooking week came round. The\r\nclothes were dried inside the Shack along a number of strings arranged\r\nat the back of the stove. Darning and mending took a little time, and\r\nour experiences in this direction were such as to demonstrate the wisdom\r\nof putting in \"a stitch in time.\"\r\n\r\nIn going over to the meteorological screen one morning I saw a giant\r\npetrel flapping about in the tussock, gorged to such an extent that it\r\ncould not rise. I killed the loathsome bird with the rib-bone of a sea\r\nelephant, and Hamilton made a fine specimen of it later on.\r\n\r\nThese birds, properly called giant petrels, are usually known as\r\n\"nellies\" or \"stinkers\"; the latter title being thoroughly justified\r\non account of the disagreeable smell which comes from them. As may be\r\ninferred from the name, they are the largest of all the petrels, and\r\nmeasure about seven feet from tip to tip when on the wing. The\r\ncolour ranges through various shades from almost pure white to a dark\r\ngreyish-brown; some even appearing almost black. Very large and ungainly\r\nwhen on the ground, they become most graceful when in the air, and soar\r\nabout without the slightest effort even on the stormiest days. I have\r\nseen them flying into a forty-mile wind with absolute ease, never\r\nmoving a wing, but occasionally adjusting their balance. They are gross\r\nscavengers, and eat apparently for the sake of eating. A carcase on the\r\nrocks or beach attracts them in large numbers, and very soon they can be\r\nseen pulling and tearing at it until thoroughly gorged, when they waddle\r\naway into the water and sit there wholly unable to rise till digestion\r\ntakes place. If disturbed, they immediately disgorge and fly off. They\r\nnest on the ground and lay one large white egg. When sitting, they\r\nare reluctant to leave the nest and will squat there, vomiting\r\nevil-smelling, partly digested food and fluid at any intruder. The\r\nyoung, even in the downy stage, have the same habit.\r\n\r\nWhen mating they go on with a queer kind of performance, which consists\r\nof running around each other on the shore with wings outspread as if\r\ndisplaying their charms, finally flying off or waddling into the water.\r\n\r\nThe persistently windy weather during March had an effect on everything\r\nexposed to its force. Sandell discovered on the 29th that the rope\r\nholding the wireless aerial had cut through, leaving only one strand,\r\nwhich now bore all the strain. It was just a matter of days before it\r\nwould part, and, with a view to preventing a repetition of February's\r\nhappening, we went up to lower the aerial, but the frayed portion of the\r\nrope would not pass through the block, so we had to leave it as it was\r\nand wait for the inevitable.\r\n\r\nExceptionally low tides at the end of the month gave Hamilton a fine\r\nopportunity of collecting marine specimens, and he secured amongst many\r\nother things some striking anemones. Some difficulty was experienced in\r\npreserving them, as they lost colour and shrivelled up. But a special\r\nline of treatment was attended by fairly successful results. They were\r\nput in shallow dishes into which sea-water was poured. Very soon they\r\nattached themselves to the bottom and began to expand, finally opening\r\nout to the fullest extent. With a view to narcotizing them while in this\r\ncondition, menthol was applied to the water but did not seem to have\r\nmuch effect. Chloral hydrate was found to give the best results.\r\nIt killed them all, but, before dying, they elongated and detached\r\nthemselves from the bottom of the dish; after which they were taken out\r\nand placed in formalin for preservation.\r\n\r\nBlake had very little opportunity of doing much survey work during the\r\nmonth, as he was hampered by a sore foot and the weather was wretched.\r\nHe therefore spent most of his time plotting data, making geological\r\ninvestigations and collecting and naming specimens.\r\n\r\nHe and Hamilton had so far confined their attention to the northern\r\nhalf of the island, and had resolved to complete the study of this area\r\nbefore tackling the southern half.\r\n\r\nThe weather throughout the month was rather severe, and only two days\r\nwere really appreciated. Precipitation occurred on twenty-five days, but\r\nthe worst feature was the continuity of strong winds, which however did\r\nnot reach gale-force on more than three occasions. Much snow and hail\r\nfell, the former accompanying winds with a southerly component, while\r\nwith the north-westers came the depressing mist or misty rain which is\r\nsuch a characteristic of the place. Temperatures, as might have been\r\nexpected, were beginning to go down, and we experienced several very\r\ncold days. The average temperature for March was 41.8 degrees, while the\r\nhighest was 46.9 degrees and the lowest 35.3 degrees F. on the 24th.\r\n\r\nAt 10 P.M. on April 1 the rope supporting the aerial parted. Sawyer and\r\nSandell were on duty at the time, but of course suspended operations\r\nimmediately. As before, the halyard also carried away and Sandell\r\nhenceforth resolved to shackle one end of the aerial to the mast, using\r\na short length of chain instead of the rope. The wreck of the Clyde was\r\nonce more our standby, providing a suitable length of chain and four\r\nshackles. After completing this job, they had very little subsequent\r\ntrouble with the aerial.\r\n\r\nHamilton and Sawyer caught several three-pound fish on April 2,\r\nand Sandell served them in good style. They were good eating, but,\r\nunfortunately, were very much worm-infested. These parasitical worms\r\nare about an inch and a half long and taper to a point at each end. They\r\npenetrate right through the flesh and are plainly noticeable after the\r\nfish is cooked. One has to dodge the worms as the meal proceeds: either\r\nthat or persuade oneself that they do not matter.\r\n\r\nThe flowing contours of the land in the vicinity of \"The Nuggets\"\r\nsuggested glacial action to Blake, and on the 4th, while making\r\ngeological investigations in that locality, he lit upon a well-defined\r\nbasal moraine. Needless to say he was very interested in the discovery,\r\nand brought home a number of polished, striated boulders as convincing\r\nevidence of his theory.\r\n\r\nIt was rather disappointing to find that the vegetables we had planted\r\nwere making little progress. They would shoot up at first very strongly,\r\nlike the \"seed which fell on stony ground,\" but, as soon as a gale\r\narose, the tops turned black and shortly afterwards withered away. It\r\nwas apparently an effect of the salt spray which, in rough weather,\r\nused to blow across the isthmus. Hamilton planted some willows and other\r\ncuttings, which shared the same fate.\r\n\r\nThe winter had now arrived in real earnest, and the months which\r\nfollowed were punctuated by a succession of gales, while we came\r\nto recognize that it was an exceptional day when the hills were not\r\nshrouded in mist. The only thing to do was to brace oneself up for the\r\nordeal and to put a good foot forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI A LAND OF STORM AND MIST\r\n\r\nby G. F. Ainsworth\r\n\r\n\r\nA Heavy north-west gale was experienced on April 12, the wind attaining\r\na force of over fifty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nAs usual, a tremendous sea worked up very quickly, and sheets of spray\r\nshredded across the isthmus. About 2 P.M. the wind shifted to west and\r\nlater to south-west; these changes being accompanied by fierce hail and\r\nsqualls of snow. During the night the wind moderated, heavy snow fell\r\nand, when morning dawned, all the pools were frozen over and the island\r\nwas draped in white. It was the heaviest fall we had so far experienced.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th Hamilton and I shot several gulls for specimens.\r\n\r\nThe Dominican or black-backed gulls are very numerous and remain on the\r\nisland all the year round. They are rather pretty, being snow-white,\r\nexcept on the upper part of the wings and back. Ordinarily their food\r\nis obtained from the water, but at Macquarie Island they live almost\r\nentirely upon the carcases left by the sealers, and are usually seen\r\ndefending their rights against skuas and giant petrels. They build nests\r\nof tussock on rocks close to the water or maybe on the ground. Three\r\neggs, much like those of the skua in colour, but with a greener tint and\r\nsmaller, are laid, but generally only two are hatched. The young leave\r\nthe nest early and hide amongst the rocks, whither the old ones come to\r\nfeed them.\r\n\r\nWe now considered it advisable to prepare for the winter, and with that\r\nend in view papered the inside of the Shack in various places. As the\r\ncold winds were particularly searching, all faulty joints in the lining\r\nwere pasted over with any kind of paper we could find. A leak down the\r\noutside of the stove-pipe was remedied, after a good deal of trouble,\r\nby soldering a collar round the pipe where it passed through the roof.\r\nFiring was an important consideration, so each man now brought home\r\nseveral loads of driftwood every day, until we had enough to keep us\r\ngoing for some months. There was a complete boot-mending outfit which\r\nwas put to a good deal of use, for the weathered rocks cut the soles of\r\nour boots and knocked out the hobnails. Our supply of the last-named\r\ndid not last long, and several of the party used strips of hoop-iron in\r\ntheir stead.\r\n\r\nBlake found it necessary to make a kind of work-desk in his section, and\r\naccordingly had a thorough rearrangement. He shifted his bunk up to a\r\nheight of about five and a half feet, very close to the ceiling; a fact\r\nwhich necessitated some wriggling and squirming on his part to get into\r\nthe sleeping-bag. There was a fine open space left underneath, and he\r\nmanaged to fix up his table very neatly.\r\n\r\nAlthough they had intended to leave the work on the southern half of the\r\nisland until the spring, Hamilton and Blake set out for Lusitania Bay on\r\nApril 28 to make a short reconnoitring trip. It was thought advisable to\r\nspend a few days down there, to improve the hut and generally speaking\r\nto have a look-round. Both men had already visited the place and depoted\r\nsome provisions there. At 8 A.M. they started off, carrying their\r\nblankets, sleeping-bags and a few other articles. Their proposal was\r\nto go along the coast as far as Sandy Bay and from thence along the\r\nhill-tops for the remaining ten miles.\r\n\r\nHail and snow-squalls succeeded each other at frequent intervals, and\r\nby the time they reached Sandy Bay, all hope of proceeding along the\r\nhill-tops was dissipated. They therefore kept near the coast. The going\r\nwas frightfully rough and the weather was very bad, so on making Green\r\nValley they camped in a small cave for the night. The floor was covered\r\nwith tussock, and, by searching amongst the rocks, enough pieces of\r\nwreckage were found to keep the fire going. On the whole they passed a\r\nfairly comfortable night. Mac proved a bit troublesome by persisting in\r\nher attempts to curl up on or between the sleeping-bags, and by finally\r\neating the jam which had been saved for breakfast. The weather was quite\r\nas bad next morning, but, after a meal of dry biscuit and cocoa, they\r\npushed on, taking four and a half hours to do the six miles. The next\r\nday was spent making the hut weather-proof and fixing up a couple of\r\nbunks. The provisions which had been cached were in good order and\r\nabundance of firewood lay around, in the shape of old barrel-staves.\r\nJust close to the living-hut was a works-hut containing boilers and\r\ndigestors which years ago had been used for procuring penguin oil, while\r\nthere was a rookery a few yards away from which the victims had come.\r\n\r\nThis rookery was the resort of King penguins, the largest of the four\r\nspecies which are to be found on the island. They are magnificently\r\ncoloured birds, being bluish-grey on the back while the head is\r\ngreenish-black and on each side of the neck there is a brilliant yellow\r\nband, shading to a greenish-yellow on the upper part of the breast, and\r\ngradually merging into the glossy white of the lower part of the body.\r\nThey attain to a height of about three feet and weigh thirty pounds\r\napproximately. The site of their rookery is a stony flat about a hundred\r\nyards from the water, and here are collected between five and six\r\nthousand--all that remain on the island.\r\n\r\nThey make no nest, the single egg laid being supported on the feet, and\r\nkept in position and incubated in a kind of skin pouch which conceals\r\nit from view. One would never guess the egg was there, for, on being\r\ndisturbed, the bird shuffles along, carrying it in the manner described.\r\nThe egg is large, tapering very much at one end and resembling a pear in\r\nshape. They lay during December and January, and the young are hatched\r\nin about six weeks. A peculiar feature about the young birds is that\r\nthe parents feed them for two seasons. They are covered with a coarse,\r\ngreyish-brown furry growth, and a year-old chick looks bigger than the\r\nold bird. This furry growth is lost during the second year and the adult\r\nplumage replaces it. The young utter a peculiar sound, something between\r\na squeak and a whistle. It is probable that the King penguins were never\r\nso numerous as the Royal or Victoria penguins, but the fact remains that\r\nthey have not yet recovered from the wholesale slaughter to which they\r\nmust have been subjected over sixteen years ago.\r\n\r\nDown on a strip of shingly beach the birds parade, when not in the\r\nrookery or at sea getting food. Their proceedings strike one as being\r\nextraordinarily human, while the dignity and gravity of the participants\r\nare beyond description. On one occasion, a large number marching along\r\nthe beach were seen to halt suddenly and talk excitedly. Three birds\r\nthen left the main body, consulted together for a short time, and then\r\nseparated. The other birds immediately separated into three companies,\r\nand each company stood behind one of the three already mentioned, who\r\nwere now some distance apart. The individuals of each party then talked\r\namong themselves for several minutes, after which two parties joined\r\nforces and marched off, leaving the third party staring after them.\r\n\r\nI have lost myself for the time being amongst the penguins and shall\r\nnow return to Blake and Hamilton, who climbed on to the hill-tops the\r\nfollowing morning to spy out the land. The island is generally speaking\r\nhigher, and all the more elevated peaks are on the southern half.\r\n\r\nThey saw numerous rabbits, of which many were black, and Mac had the day\r\nof her life amongst them. These animals were introduced to the island\r\nabout twenty-five years ago, and have gradually withdrawn to the\r\nlonelier southern part, though occasionally odd ones are seen about the\r\nnorthern end. They are very tame and live in holes amongst the rocks or\r\nmake burrows in the gully banks and broken hill sides.\r\n\r\nMany lakes, frozen over, were seen, several of which were fairly large.\r\nAltogether, the topography is similar to that of the northern end.\r\n\r\nIn an endeavour to improve the evening fare, a sweet broth consisting\r\nof biscuit, milk, jam and sugar was tried but it was not a success;\r\nHamilton remarking that \"even Blake had only one helping.\" On the\r\nfollowing morning they started for the Shack and chose the route on the\r\nhilltops, as the ground was frozen hard; and, though there were frequent\r\nsnow-drifts into which they floundered occasionally, the surface for\r\ntravelling was much better than along the coast.\r\n\r\nHamilton slipped and hurt his ankle on the trip, and the boots of both\r\nwere just about worn out. They apprehended no difficulty in completing\r\ntheir prospective work. Blake pointed out that the chart of the island\r\nshows Lusitania Bay as being rather a large indentation, whereas in\r\nreality it is almost a straight stretch of coast.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake shock was felt at 9.15 P.M. on the 27th. I was sitting in\r\nthe Shack writing up records at the time, and it seemed as if somebody\r\nhad struck the south-west end of the place a severe blow with a bag of\r\nsand. Immediately afterwards a crashing sound, apparently some distance\r\naway on the eastern side, indicated that some rocks on the cliff-front\r\nhad been dislodged.\r\n\r\nMuch rough weather was experienced during the month, and it rained,\r\nhailed and snowed on twenty-five days. The wind attained moderate to\r\nfresh gale-force on six days, and fog and mist were almost invariable.\r\nThe lowest temperature recorded was 32.7 degrees F.\r\n\r\nThe average relative humidity for the four months ending April 30 was 93\r\nper cent., leading to copious condensation on the instruments exposed\r\nto the air. It was necessary, therefore, constantly to attend and\r\nfrequently clean the thermographs, hygrometers and the wireless plant.\r\nIn the case of the latter, loss of power occurred in the form of \"brush\r\ndischarge,\" and Sawyer had to take great care in order to guard against\r\nthis accident. He shellacked the condensers and other exposed parts and\r\nfound the proceeding rather effective. I noticed that the drifting snow\r\nand misty rain managed to get down the opening leading to the liquid\r\nsurface of the anemobiagraph, thus altering the zero of the recording\r\napparatus. When this happened the instrument had to be dismantled and\r\nset right.\r\n\r\nWe found it necessary to use sea elephant blubber in the stove in order\r\nto warm the Shack, and a very small piece put on the fire at intervals\r\nalways ensured a good heat. Sea elephants had become scarce, so, in\r\norder to lay in a supply of fuel for the next few weeks, we went round\r\nto Aerial Cove on the 3rd and killed the largest animal we could find,\r\nafterwards carrying the blubber round to the Shack. We came through\r\nCatch Me and had the same old experience. Hamilton examined the contents\r\nof the stomach of the sea elephant and found gravel, stones, cuttlefish,\r\nbeaks and \"worms\" in abundance.\r\n\r\nA violent north-west gale during the early morning hours of the 4th\r\nreached a maximum velocity of fifty-two miles an hour at 5.20 A.M., but\r\nat 8 A.M. it began to weaken rapidly and an hour later had shifted to\r\nwest-south-west, coming from that point as a moderate gale for the rest\r\nof the day. As was usual with winds having any southerly component, snow\r\nand squalls of soft hail were experienced. With the exception of the\r\nwind-vane, which was blown a few yards into the tussock, nothing was\r\ndamaged.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Blake and I had a trip down to the moraine which he had\r\nfound a few days previously. After a heavy one and a half hours' walk,\r\nthe last half-mile of which was along a creek bed, with water ankle-deep\r\nall the way, we reached the spot: the site of one of the large penguin\r\nrookeries up on the hills at the back of \"The Nuggets.\" The sun showed\r\nbetween squalls, and Blake took some interesting photographs of rocks\r\nshowing striae and other glacial characteristics. We battled with\r\none enormous boulder for some time before getting it into a suitable\r\nposition for the camera, and afterwards walked right through the glacial\r\narea. The U-shaped character of the valleys was very pronounced, while\r\nboulder-clay obtruded itself everywhere on our notice.\r\n\r\nHobart wireless station was by this time in working order, a fact which\r\ngreatly facilitated wireless business. Sandell took the engine to pieces\r\nearly in the month and gave it, as well as the fittings, a thorough\r\noverhaul and cleaning. We received a message on the 7th, saying that the\r\n'Aurora' was leaving Hobart on the 13th for a sub-antarctic cruise and\r\nwould call at the island. At the same time I was requested to send a\r\nlist of articles required. I found, after going through the stock\r\nand consulting each member, that we needed nothing but strong boots,\r\ncartridges, dungaree trousers, coarse salt, cigarettes and fresh\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nA persistent area of high pressure affected the weather conditions of\r\nthe island to the extent of shrouding us in fog from the 6th to the 10th\r\ninclusive, and we did not catch a glimpse of the sun during that period.\r\nThe average daily temperature-range during this time was only 2.3\r\ndegrees. Such conditions have a rather depressing effect on the spirits,\r\nbut the cheering news we received on the 7th made some amends for the\r\nlack of sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe sun appeared at last on the 11th and shone strongly, so Blake and\r\nI went up to Wireless Hill to take some \"shots\" with the theodolite. I\r\nnoticed four of our sheep on the front of the hill, and, as there should\r\nhave been nine, Sandell and I, after finishing with Blake, walked out\r\nto North Head to see if the others were all right. We found them on the\r\nnorth-east side of the hill and drove them up to the rest of the flock.\r\n\r\nFrom the hill-top we could see Hamilton engaged in skinning a large\r\nsea leopard on the coast, so we climbed down to render any necessary\r\nassistance. It was a beautifully marked animal, about eleven feet long,\r\nand made a fine specimen.\r\n\r\nSea leopards frequent Macquarie Island in great numbers from the late\r\nwinter to the early summer, and may be seen lying about, sleeping close\r\nto the water and apparently always very tired. They do not give birth to\r\nthe young there, and from observations I concluded that they were born\r\nat sea. We had taken female specimens on several occasions, apparently\r\nwithin a few hours of parturition, and as none had been seen with newly\r\nborn young, and no islands lay within several hundred miles, it was\r\npresumed that the birth took place in the water. Until the young one is\r\nweaned, its habitat is evidently in the water as we never saw an adult\r\nsuckling its offspring.\r\n\r\nSea leopards--long, lithe creatures with a reptilian cast of head--are\r\nremarkably quick in the water. If one is disturbed on shore it opens its\r\nmouth very wide, revealing a wicked-looking row of teeth in each jaw;\r\nthe canine teeth or tusks being very long and slightly curved.\r\n\r\nUnlike sea elephants and seals they are solitary animals, and should\r\nseveral of them be found on a small gravelly patch of beach they are\r\nseen to be as far as possible from one another. We have never seen them\r\nattempt to fight on the shore, but the gaping wounds and scars with\r\nwhich they are frequently covered indicate that they treat each other\r\nvery severely in the water. They live on penguins, gulls, shags and\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nI saw several shags on one occasion very busy fishing, and between\r\ndiving intervals they would sit on the water. Suddenly one disappeared\r\nunder the water and the rest flew off; but in a few seconds the one\r\nwhich had disappeared was thrown into the air and caught by a sea\r\nleopard, who played in this fashion with the maimed bird for several\r\nminutes before devouring it.\r\n\r\nA few days previously we had received a request from Mr. D. C. Bates,\r\nthe New Zealand Meteorologist, for a daily weather report, and from the\r\n12th onwards a message was sent nightly to Wellington, a distance\r\nof about eleven hundred miles. In acknowledging these reports,\r\nsubsequently, the office referred to their immediate value in the issue\r\nof daily forecasts, and expressed indebtedness to the Expedition.\r\n\r\nThe two species of penguins which leave the island during the winter\r\nmonths had disappeared, and silence now reigned where formerly were\r\nbusy, noisy colonies. The departure of the migrants made the place seem\r\nlonelier and, during the depths of winter when snow covers the ground\r\nand the birds and animals are few in number, a more dreary spot would be\r\ndifficult to find.\r\n\r\nThe weather conditions were now rather severe, and as Sawyer and\r\nSandell worked from 8 P.M. till 2 or 3 A.M. every night and slept at the\r\nwireless station, they were exempted from the necessity of coming down\r\nto get breakfast during their cooking weeks. They now rested till about\r\nnoon, and arrived at the Shack every day in time for lunch. Hamilton,\r\nBlake and I, each outside his own cooking week, took it in turns to\r\nprepare breakfast.\r\n\r\nBlake's fieldwork at the north end, more particularly in the vicinity of\r\nWest Point and North Head, was just about finished. West Point proved to\r\nbe an area of gabbro, a coarse-grained eruptive rock representative of\r\nbasic rocks, while North Head was composed of basic agglomerate, and\r\nvolcanic bombs were numerous.\r\n\r\nHamilton had got together a good collection of bird specimens, and was\r\nnow in quest of skeletons.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 13th we witnessed a rather pretty auroral\r\nmanifestation. It assumed the appearance of a Noah's ark cloud, that is,\r\nstretching from opposite points on the horizon and appearing to converge\r\nat each one of these points. The light was a pale yellow, no other tint\r\nbeing visible. In addition, a nebulous glow appeared at intervals in the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nWe heard on the 16th that the 'Aurora' had sailed on that day from\r\nHobart and would arrive at Macquarie Island in about three weeks;\r\noceanographical work being carried out on the trip down. This was indeed\r\ncheerful news, and we began to look forward to her arrival.\r\n\r\nA fresh west-south-west gale during the early morning hours of the 17th\r\nwas accompanied by soft hail and snow-squalls, and the temperature at\r\n9 A.M. was 31.2 degrees F. The ground was covered with snow and all the\r\npools were frozen over, but at 9 P.M. there was a rapid shift of the\r\nwind to the north-west and the snow almost disappeared. Soft hail,\r\ngenerally a little larger than tapioca and of the same shape, frequently\r\nfell. These little pellets are formed of compressed snow and are\r\ncommonly supposed to be frozen cloud-particles mixed with raindrops\r\ncompacted by a high wind.\r\n\r\nOn the following night, Blake and I went up to wireless Hill to take\r\nstar observations. It was very dark and the hill-front was slippery,\r\nfrequent falls being the rule. Just after setting up the instrument, the\r\nwind freshened to such an extent that it was impossible to do anything,\r\nso we descended very wet and muddy to the Shack, having had a rough\r\npassage. The reason for this was that I fell on the lantern and\r\nextinguished the light.\r\n\r\nWe were supplied with two hurricane lamps which do not by any means\r\ndeserve their title as they blow out in even a moderately strong wind.\r\nSandell made a lantern for his own use, declaring that it was impossible\r\nfor any wind to blow it out. I firmly believed him, as it was a little\r\nbinnacle lamp placed inside a small oatmeal tin into which a cleaned\r\nphotographic plate had been fixed and with holes punched in the bottom\r\nand top of the tin for ventilation. It was thus a lamp with two covers,\r\nand frequent demonstrations of its ability to survive heavy blows were\r\nmade by the inventor.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three days a forty-mile wind accompanied by snow, hail\r\nand sleet was experienced and the maximum temperature on the 25th\r\ndid not reach freezing-point, the ground being firmly frozen and\r\nsnow-covered. During the evening of the last-named date the wind shifted\r\nto north-west, and by noon on the 26th no snow remained, except on the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of the 'Aurora's arrival, Blake and Hamilton collected\r\nsome stores together in the hope that Captain Davis would transport them\r\ndown to Lusitania Bay, thus obviating the necessity of carrying them\r\ndown on foot. As Blake reckoned that he would remain there fully three\r\nmonths and Hamilton about two months, it was thought that such another\r\nopportunity might not present itself.\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of the naval officials, H.M.S. Drake sent us\r\ntime-signals twice a week, and though we had so far heard no sound from\r\nAdelie Land, there was a possibility that they could receive messages\r\nfrom us. Sawyer therefore sent out time-signals as a matter of routine.\r\n\r\nHamilton made a trip to the west coast on the 28th and returned with\r\nthirteen wekas. Sawyer did not care for these birds, but each of the\r\nothers could account for one at a meal. They seem to be better eating if\r\nplucked like a fowl and roasted, but the plucking takes too long and\r\nwe generally skinned and boiled them. It is advisable to hang them for\r\nseveral days before cooking as it certainly makes them tender.\r\n\r\nRough, stormy weather prevailed during the greater part of the month and\r\nthe wind reached the force of a gale on nine days. Much snow, soft hail\r\nand sleet fell and some very cold days were experienced. The average\r\ntemperature was 40 degrees, the maximum being 44.7 degrees and the\r\nminimum 27.8 degrees F.\r\n\r\nA heavy snowfall occurred during the early morning hours of June 3, and\r\nthe temperature was below freezing-point all day. In the afternoon we\r\nhad rather an enjoyable time tobogganing down a steep talus-slope on the\r\neast coast. A considerable struggle was necessary in order to get the\r\nsledge to the top, but the lightning slide to the bottom more than\r\ncompensated for the labour.\r\n\r\nWe made wireless inquiries concerning the 'Aurora' at night, and were\r\ninformed by Hobart that a search for the Royal Company Islands was\r\nincluded in her programme. It was therefore presumed that she was\r\nengaged in prosecuting this search and would probably not reach us for\r\nsome days.\r\n\r\nHamilton killed a very fine sea leopard on the 5th and the skin, apart\r\nfrom being unscarred, was handsomely marked. It should make a splendid\r\nspecimen. The stomach contained more than the usual number of worms and\r\none specimen of tape-worm, seven inches long and three-eighths of an\r\ninch wide, was preserved.\r\n\r\nEverything was going along in the usual placid manner on the 7th, when,\r\nas we were just taking our seats for lunch, some one rushed in with\r\nthe information that the 'Aurora' was in sight. There was a scramble to\r\nvarious points of vantage and she was soon observed coming up the east\r\ncoast very slowly. At 2.30 P.M. she dropped anchor in North-East Bay,\r\nbut, as it was blowing strongly and a nasty sea was running, no boat\r\nwas launched, though one may imagine how anxiously we watched for some\r\nmovement in that direction. As soon as it became dark a message was\r\n\"Morsed\" to us to the effect that a boat would bring mails and goods\r\nashore in the morning if the weather moderated, and with that we had\r\nto be content. Needless to say, business ashore was for the time being\r\nparalysed, but a message was sent to the Secretary in Hobart advising\r\nhim of the Ship's arrival.\r\n\r\nTrue to his intimation of the previous night, Captain Davis brought a\r\nboat ashore at 9.30 A.M. and with him came several visitors who were to\r\nbe our guests for some days. They were Mr. E. R. Waite, Curator of\r\nthe Canterbury Museum and his taxidermist, and Mr. Primmer, a\r\ncinematographer. Conspicuous in the boat was a well-laden mail bag and\r\nno time was lost in distributing the contents. Letters, papers, and\r\nmagazines were received by every member of the party, and all the news\r\nwas \"good.\" Some stores were brought along and, after getting these\r\nashore, we took the visitors across to the Shack and invited them to\r\nmake themselves at home.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis also came along to the Shack and afterwards looked over\r\nthe wireless station. He returned to the ship just after lunch, and\r\nSandell, Sawyer and Blake took the opportunity of going on board.\r\nHamilton, in the meantime, piloted the visitors on a short trip round\r\nto Aerial Cove, introducing them to Catch Me, where they were duly\r\nbaptized. They afterwards climbed up Wireless Hill and had a look at the\r\nstation, returning to the Shack much impressed with the rough nature of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nBlake went off to the ship again, taking the stores which had been got\r\nready for transport to Lusitania Bay, as the captain had agreed to land\r\nthem when he visited there in a few days' time.\r\n\r\nAmongst the cases which were landed was one containing the recording\r\napparatus for the tide-gauge. The other parts of this instrument had\r\nbeen left on the island in December, but for some reason the clock and\r\ncharts had gone astray and were not found till the vessel was being\r\nunloaded in Adelie Land. Some thermometers and a Robinson anemometer\r\nhad also been overcarried and, when they came to light, the latter was\r\nimmediately placed in commission.\r\n\r\nCaptain Davis sent a boat ashore on the morning of the 12th with an\r\ninvitation to come on board and lunch. I accordingly went out to the\r\nvessel and, after lunching, had a thorough look over her, mentally\r\ncontrasting her spick-and-span appearance at the time with what it had\r\nbeen when I left her in December. I went ashore again in the afternoon\r\nand assisted the visitors to get their loads down to the boat, as they\r\nwere returning to the ship, which was leaving next morning on a sounding\r\ntrip down the island.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th we started to carry the stores across to the Shack on our\r\nbacks. We soon realized that seventy or eighty pounds was not a light\r\nload over a half-mile stretch of rough, shingly beach, but succeeded in\r\ntransporting the onions, apples and potatoes before finishing for\r\nthe night. The other articles were brought over during the next two\r\nafternoons.\r\n\r\nThe tide-gauge pipe, weighing about six hundredweights, and the box for\r\nthe housing of the recording gear had been landed in December round in\r\nAerial Cove, where a site had been chosen for the erection of the gauge.\r\nExperience showed me that the place was unsuitable, so I took Hamilton,\r\nSandell and Sawyer round to the cove on the 15th and we decided, as we\r\nhad no boat, that it was impossible to carry the pipe round to the east\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nI had been making some tidal observations on an upright, fixed in a\r\ncomparatively quiet spot on the east coast, and it was here that I\r\ncontemplated erecting the gauge. Two snow-gauges, eight inches each in\r\ndiameter, were amongst the meteorological equipment and it appeared\r\nthat if these two were soldered together a suitable pipe could be made.\r\nFurther, the pipe was to be protected from the violence of the seas by\r\nplanks fixed round it. Sandell agreed with the idea and forthwith set\r\nabout soldering the two together and making a suitable float, the one\r\nsupplied being too wide. All that now remained was to erect the gauge.\r\n\r\nThe two following afternoons were devoted to stowing the new stores. We\r\ncarried everything across and stacked them at the south-west end of the\r\nShack. Unfortunately, the boots which we had ordered did not come, but\r\nCaptain Davis let us have five pairs of light bluchers out of the ship's\r\nstores, and we reckoned that these with extra soles and a few hobnails\r\nwould hold out till August or September, when a sealing vessel was\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe 'Aurora' returned from the south of the island on the 19th and\r\nreported having had a rough experience in the north-east to south gale\r\nwhich blew on the two previous days. The wind came out of the\r\nnorth-east very suddenly on the 17th, and some very strong squalls were\r\nexperienced. A calm prevailed for several hours in the evening, but a\r\nsouth-east gale then sprang up and blew all day on the 18th, gradually\r\nworking into the south and dying away during the night.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 20th the 'Aurora' steamed out of the bay, bound north as we\r\nthought, but she returned again in the evening, and we signalled to know\r\nif anything were wrong. They replied, \"All well, but weather very bad\r\noutside.\" She lay at anchor in the bay all next day as it was snowing\r\nand blowing very hard from the south-west, but at 8.45 A.M. on the\r\n22nd she disappeared in the north and we did not see her again for some\r\nmonths. A few hours after her departure the wind increased in force, and\r\na continuous gale raged for the next five days.\r\n\r\nSandell and I now made a start at erecting the tide-gauge, and after the\r\nlapse of five days got the instrument into position. We could work on it\r\nonly at low tide, for much rock had to be chipped away and numerous wire\r\nstays fixed. The work was therefore of a disagreeable character. Its\r\nappearance when finished did not by any means suggest the amount of\r\ntrouble we experienced in setting it up, but the fact that it stood the\r\nheavy seas for the following eighteen months without suffering material\r\ndamage was a sufficient guarantee that the work had been well done.\r\n\r\nA tremendous sea was running on the 25th as a result of the previous\r\ntwo days' \"blow\" and a heavy gale still persisting. Spray was scudding\r\nacross the isthmus, and the sea for a mile from the shore was just a\r\nseething cauldron. The wind moderated somewhat on the 26th, but strong\r\nsqualls were experienced at intervals throughout the day, and on the\r\n27th a strong wind from the south-west brought rather heavy snow.\r\n\r\nOn the following day a westerly gale sprang up which shifted suddenly\r\nto south-south-west and south-west in the evening and was accompanied by\r\nfierce hail and snow-squalls throughout the night. Without moderating\r\nto any extent the gale continued to blow on the 29th and passed through\r\nwest to west-north-west, finally lasting till the end of the month.\r\n\r\nSomething in the nature of a \"tidal\" wave occurred during the night\r\nof the 28th, for, on rising the following morning, I was considerably\r\nastonished to see that the sea-water had been almost across the\r\nisthmus. To effect this, a rise of twenty or twenty-five feet above\r\nmean sea-level must have taken place and such a rise appeared abnormally\r\nhigh. Our coal heap, which we had hitherto regarded as perfectly safe\r\nfrom the sea, was submerged, as shown by the kelp and sand lying on top\r\nof it, and the fact that seven or eight briquettes were found fifteen\r\nfeet away from the heap.\r\n\r\nNothing at the wireless station was damaged and work went on as usual.\r\nThe wind used to make a terrific noise in the aerial wires, but this did\r\nnot affect the transmission of messages. The howling of the wind round\r\nthe operating-hut interfered with the receiving, at times making\r\nit extremely difficult to hear signals; particularly on nights not\r\nfavourable for wireless work.\r\n\r\nHamilton was at this time concentrating his attention on shags or\r\ncormorants. This species of cormorant is peculiar to the island, being\r\nfound nowhere else. They are blue-black, with a white breast, and on the\r\nhead they have a small black crest. At the top of the beak are golden\r\nlobes, while the skin immediately round the eye is pale blue. They\r\nremain on the shores of the island all the year and nest on the rocks\r\nin or very close to the water. They form rookeries and build nests\r\nof grass, laying three eggs about the end of November. The period\r\nof incubation is six weeks. They live entirely on fish, and, on that\r\naccount, neither the birds nor the eggs are palatable. They are very\r\nstupid, staring curiously till one gets almost within reach of them,\r\nwhen they flap heavily into the water. They are easily caught when\r\nsitting on the nest, but a shag rookery, like most other rookeries, is\r\nby no means a pleasant place in which to linger.\r\n\r\nI had the satisfaction of getting the first record from the tide-gauge\r\non the first day of July, but the clock worked erratically, requiring\r\nsome attention.\r\n\r\nHamilton had a lobster-pot set some distance from the shore and anchored\r\nto a float, but unfortunately the pot was lost in the rough seas at the\r\nend of June. He had a couple of fish-traps also, but, in view of this\r\ndisaster, he decided to set these in Aerial Cove, where the water was\r\nquieter. Having a couple of sea leopard heads which required macerating,\r\nhe baited the trap with them and lowered it into the water, securing it\r\nto the rock with a steel wire.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of a bright sun on the following day, Blake and\r\nHamilton went to \"The Nuggets\" and took some geological and biological\r\nphotographs, which on being developed turned out well. They had occasion\r\nto enter one of the unoccupied huts down there and found a wild cat a\r\nlittle more than half grown, which they caught and carried home with\r\nthem. He was of the usual tabby colour and by no means fierce, quickly\r\nyielding to the coaxing treatment of his captors. He made himself quite\r\nat home in the Shack, and we looked forward to a display of his prowess\r\nas a rat-catcher.\r\n\r\nA bright display of the aurora occurred on the night of July 4, the\r\nribbons and streamers of light being well defined and occasionally\r\nslightly coloured. We could establish no connexion between this\r\nextraordinary outburst and the fact that it occurred on American\r\nIndependence night, but it was certainly the most energetic\r\nmanifestation of the phenomenon we had so far witnessed. Many \"glows\"\r\nhad been seen, and also a few displays of the arch-shaped form, but none\r\nhad shown much activity or rapid movement.\r\n\r\nThe operator was requested by the Pennant Hills high-power wireless\r\nstation at Sydney to listen for signals tapped out during the daytime,\r\nand Sawyer spent a couple of hours on certain mornings assisting in\r\nthese tests, which were attended with some success. We occasionally\r\nreceived press news from land stations or from ships passing across the\r\nTasman Sea, but it was only a brief summary of the cable news: enough to\r\nwhet one's curiosity, rarely ever satisfying it.\r\n\r\nVery cold, rough weather was experienced on the 6th and 7th and a\r\ntemperature of 26 degrees F. occurred on the latter date, while the\r\nmaximum did not reach freezing-point. Much snow and soft hail fell,\r\nand the ground set hard. The weather interfered to some extent with\r\nthe tide-gauge clock, and it became so unsatisfactory that I took it to\r\npieces on the 9th and gave it a thorough cleaning, after which it had a\r\nnew lease of life.\r\n\r\nWe received a message on the 11th saying that the 'Aurora' had arrived\r\nin Dunedin, \"all well,\" but had experienced a very rough voyage which\r\ngreatly interfered with the dredging and sounding programme.\r\n\r\nOur tank water gave out for the first time on the 12th. The\r\nprecipitation for a fortnight had been in the form of dry powdery snow\r\nand soft hail, the wind blowing it off the roof before it had a chance\r\nto thaw, thus robbing us of our usual water-supply. For a while we had\r\nto use swamp water, which contained a good many insects of various kinds\r\nand had a distinctly peaty flavour. Finding good water running from the\r\nhill-tops down a deep gully on the east coast, three-quarters of a mile\r\naway, we carried drinking water from there, using the other for washing\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe 13th was a most delightful day--bright sun, very little wind\r\nand fresh exhilarating air. Blake and Hamilton went out early on a\r\nphotographing excursion, and, later on, the latter shot and skinned a\r\nwhite giant petrel.\r\n\r\nDuring the third week of July a very low tide exposed rocks, ordinarily\r\nsubmerged, and Hamilton was occupied all the week in collecting marine\r\norganisms, worms and plants and then preserving, bottling and labelling\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA most peculiar sight was witnessed on the 17th. Aerial Cove is a\r\nfavourite nesting-place for shags, and they may be seen in twos and\r\nthrees flying round in that direction almost any time during the day;\r\nbut on this particular day a kind of wholesale exodus from the cove\r\ntook place, and large flocks of them followed each other for a couple of\r\nhours. They congregated on the rocks along the east coast, or settled in\r\nthe water in scores; the latter fact suggesting that the probable reason\r\nfor this extraordinary behaviour was the presence of unusual shoals of\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nWe used to relax and have a game of cards occasionally, while our small\r\norgan became a medium of much enjoyment. All the members except one\r\nplayed well enough to enjoy themselves and to give pleasure to the\r\nothers. There was a distinct predilection in favour of \"ragtime\" and I\r\nmust say I liked to hear that music at frequent intervals. Any one\r\nwho plays a musical instrument knows that the mood of the player is\r\ngenerally reflected in the character of the music, particularly when he\r\nsits down and plays in a casual way.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit and killing of a sheep had now become something in the\r\nnature of an experience, and when Sandell and I went hunting for one\r\non the 20th, we realized it before we reached home. The flock was\r\nvery timid, and when disturbed on North Head invariably came past the\r\nwireless station close to the engine-hut. Sandell concealed himself\r\nthere with a gun, while I went out to startle the animals. They did not\r\nfail to do their part, but Sandell missed and the shot frightened them.\r\nHe then rushed out and fired another shot as they were running, managing\r\nto hit one, which immediately dropped behind and ran to the edge of the\r\ncliff. We did not want to shoot the sheep at this moment, as it would\r\nhave fallen about two hundred feet, so we cautiously approached to drive\r\nit away. The poor creature simply took a leap out into space and\r\nlanded on the talus below, down which it rolled to the water's edge.\r\nWe scrambled down and skinned it, having to carry the carcase along the\r\nrocks at the base of the cliffs, and getting many duckings on the way.\r\n\r\nOn July 26 I went round to Aerial Cove with Hamilton to have a look\r\nat the fish-trap, but it had disappeared, the wire having broken,\r\napparently through the continual friction against rock. He had\r\npreviously caught some fish in it, and it was rather a misfortune to\r\nlose it so soon.\r\n\r\nDuring the last week of the month we all had our hair cut. On arrival\r\nat the island, several of us had it shorn very closely with the clippers\r\nand had not trimmed it since then, growth being very slow. We had a\r\nproper hair-cutting outfit and either Blake, Hamilton or Sandell acted\r\nas barber.\r\n\r\nBlake was an expert with the needle and did some really neat mending,\r\nwhile with the aid of some woollen thread and a mug he darned holes in\r\nhis socks most artistically. He was the authority on how, when and\r\nwhere to place a patch or on the only method of washing clothes. The\r\nappearance of his articles when washed, compared with mine, made me\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nHamilton was busy, about this time, dredging in swamp pools and securing\r\nspecimens of the rockhopper or gentoo penguin.\r\n\r\nThe small gentoo penguins, like the King penguins, do not migrate and\r\nare few in numbers. They form diminutive colonies, which are always\r\nestablished on mounds amongst the tussock, or on the hill sides not far\r\nfrom the water. Their eggs, which are globular in shape, are about the\r\nbest of the penguin eggs for eating, and if their nests are robbed the\r\nbirds will generally lay again, although I think they could not lay more\r\nthan four eggs. They build their nests of grass and plant leaves, and\r\noccasionally have been known to establish a fresh rookery after their\r\nfirst one has been robbed. They are more timid than any other species\r\nof penguin, and leave the nests in a body when one ventures into the\r\nrookery. The skuas take advantage of this peculiarity to the length of\r\nwaiting about till a chance presents itself, when they swoop down, pick\r\nup an egg with their beak and fly off. The penguin makes a great fuss on\r\nreturning to find that the eggs are gone, but generally finishes up by\r\nsitting on the empty nest. We have frequently put ten or a dozen eggs\r\ninto one nest and watched the proprietress on her return look about\r\nvery doubtfully and then squat down and try to tuck the whole lot under\r\nherself with her beak.\r\n\r\nWeather conditions were rough enough during July, but occasionally a\r\nfairly quiet day would occur. High winds were experienced on ten days,\r\nthe greatest hourly average for any twenty-four hours being thirty-two\r\nmiles, but no day averaged less than ten miles. Precipitation occurred\r\non twenty-one days, mostly in the form of snow and soft hail. The mean\r\ntemperature was 37.7 degrees, with extremes of 43.3 degrees and 26\r\ndegrees F. The average percentage of cloud was 78; somewhat less than\r\nusual and due to the greater frequency of south-west winds, which almost\r\nalways bring a broken sky.\r\n\r\nNow that our life was one of smooth routine I devoted a good deal of\r\ntime to reducing the meteorological observations. Hourly pressure and\r\ntemperature readings as well as descriptive remarks, averages and other\r\ndetails required to be summarized, and this occupied a considerable\r\namount of time, so I made a practice of spending a couple of hours\r\neach day on the work, whenever possible, hoping thereby to pick up the\r\n\"leeway.\" I did not take too kindly to inactive writing in the Shack,\r\nbut the weather conditions were such that I was glad to stay indoors,\r\nthough that meant enduring the inevitable cold feet. The floor of the\r\nShack was never warm, and of course there were no carpets.\r\n\r\nMac developed a great animosity against the rats and thoroughly enjoyed\r\nrooting them out on all occasions. The only explanation of their\r\npresence on the island is that they had arrived in the ships which were\r\nwrecked along the coasts. They got into the Shack several times, and we\r\nsimply brought in Mac and shifted things about till she caught them.\r\n\r\nRough weather occurred during the first week of August, and with\r\noccasional temporary weakenings a gale blew throughout, reaching fifty\r\nmiles an hour at different times. Snow, hail and sleet fell every day,\r\nand on the 3rd the temperature was below freezing-point all day. The\r\nShack, which always shook a little in exceptionally heavy gales, now\r\nvibrated a good deal in a forty-mile wind, no doubt feeling the effects\r\nof the beating it had undergone.\r\n\r\nBlake found a cave running through North Head and went round, on the\r\n5th, to examine it. He proved it to be about sixty yards from opening to\r\nopening, and to widen out very much inside; the roof being about fifteen\r\nfeet above the floor.\r\n\r\nHamilton and Sandell went along the coast on the 6th and brought home a\r\ndozen Maori hens for the pot. Hamilton secured some spiders, parasites\r\non birds and many beetles under the moss and stones on the site of a\r\npenguin rookery, besides shooting a few terns.\r\n\r\nThe tern is a very pretty bird with light grey plumage, a black head and\r\nred beak and feet. We found no nests on the island, though the fact that\r\nthe birds remain throughout the year implies that they breed there. They\r\nfly very fast while not appearing to do so, but their movements are by\r\nno means graceful. They flit about over the water close to the shore,\r\nevery now and then dipping down picking up morsels and keeping up a\r\nconstant, shrill squeaking.\r\n\r\nThe sea was so high on the 7th that it reached the weight of the\r\ntide-gauge and, lifting it up, unshipped the recording gear, as the\r\nsteel wire flew off the wheel before the latter could take up the slack.\r\nI deemed it advisable to use stout cord instead of wire in the future\r\nand made a protective slot for the weight. I had blocked up the seaward\r\nside of the pipe with rocks, but found that these caused a deposit of\r\nsilt so I had to get into the water at low tide and shift them all out\r\nagain to clean away the accumulation of sand.\r\n\r\nVery heavy snow fell during the afternoon, the flakes being the size of\r\nhalf a crown. A fresh north-north-west wind dropped to a calm at 4 P.M.\r\nand almost immediately it began to snow, the island being quite white by\r\n5.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nBright sunny intervals alternated with light snow-squalls on the 10th,\r\nand the temperature was below freezing-point all day. It was pleasant\r\nto be out of doors, and I walked along to the west coast to see if there\r\nwere any signs of activity amongst the sea elephants.\r\n\r\nAn unmistakable sign of the near approach of the breeding season was the\r\npresence of an enormous old bull, almost too fat to move, lying on the\r\nbeach. Very few small ones were seen, as, on the arrival of the adult\r\nmales and females for the breeding season, the young ones leave for\r\na while, presumably in order to get fat for the moulting period, or\r\nbecause they are afraid of the bulls, who are particularly savage at\r\nthis time. The full-grown bulls attain to a length of twenty feet, and\r\nhave a fleshy proboscis about eight or ten inches in length hanging over\r\nthe mouth, suggesting the trunk of an elephant. It is from this fact\r\nthat they derive the name of sea elephant.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable disparity in size between the adult male and\r\nfemale, the latter very rarely exceeding eleven feet, though we have\r\nseen a few twelve and thirteen feet long. The females have no snout\r\ndevelopment and some of them facially very much resemble a bull terrier.\r\nThe adults are called bulls and cows, while, curiously enough, in the\r\nsealers' phrase, the offspring are referred to as pups. The places where\r\nlarge numbers of them gather together during the breeding season are\r\nknown as rookeries! \"Rookery\" appears to me to be inapplicable to a\r\nherd of sea elephants, though \"pup\" supplies a more apt description of\r\nthe young.\r\n\r\nThe pups, born during September or early October, are covered with a\r\nlong, black, wavy fur, which they lose when about two months old, and in\r\nits place comes a growth of silver-grey hair, which changes later into\r\nthe ordinary brown colour of the full-grown animal.\r\n\r\nThe old males and females leave the island about the end of January, and\r\nare not seen again (except a few stray ones) till August in the case of\r\nthe males, and until September in the case of the females.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the bulls arrive first leads one to the conclusion that\r\ntheir feeding-grounds must lie at a considerable distance and, in the\r\njourney therefrom, the males, being the stronger, should arrive before\r\nthe females, who are heavy with young and probably make a somewhat\r\nleisurely progress, feeding by the way.\r\n\r\nThe rookeries vary in size, containing from half a dozen to four or\r\nfive hundred cows; in the last case, of course, being an aggregation\r\nof smaller rookeries, each with its proprietor, in the shape of an old\r\nbull, lying in or somewhere near the centre. The normal rookery, as far\r\nas I could judge, seemed to be one that contained about forty cows, but\r\nonce the nucleus was formed, it was hard to say how many cows would be\r\nthere before the season ended, as females keep arriving for a period of\r\nabout three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe young vary in length from three and a half to four and a half feet,\r\nare born within a few days of arrival and suckled for about a month,\r\nbecoming enormously fat. The cow, who has not eaten during the whole of\r\nthis time and has become very thin, then leaves the pup, but remains\r\nin the rookery for about two days, after which she escapes to sea,\r\nremaining there till the beginning of January, when she returns to\r\nthe island to moult. The pups when weaned get such rough usage in the\r\nrookery that they soon make off into the tussock and sleep for about a\r\nmonth, living on their fat and acquiring a new coat. The noise in one of\r\nthe large rookeries is something to remember--the barking of the pups,\r\nthe whimpering and yelping of the mothers and the roaring of the bulls.\r\n\r\nAnother feature in connexion with the rookery is the presence of what\r\nmay be called unattached bulls, which lie around at a little distance\r\nfrom the cows, and well apart, forming a regular ring through which any\r\ncow wishing to desert her pup or leave the rookery before the proper\r\ntime has very little chance of passing, as one of these grips her firmly\r\nwith his powerful flipper and stays her progress. The lord of the harem,\r\nin the meantime, hastens to the scene of the disturbance, whereupon the\r\nother bull decamps.\r\n\r\nThe sea immediately in the vicinity of a large rookery is generally\r\nswarming with unattached bulls, who may be seen with their heads out of\r\nthe water eyeing each other and keeping a bright look out for escaping\r\ncows. Now and again one may see a bull in the water gripping a cow with\r\nhis flipper, despite her struggles, and roaring at a couple of others\r\nwho show up menacingly quite close to him.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that towards the end of the season changes in the\r\nproprietorship of a rookery are rather rapid, as continuous raids are\r\nmade by individuals from the outside. The need of continuous vigilance\r\nand the results of many encounters eventually lead to the defeat and\r\ndiscomfiture of the once proud proprietor.\r\n\r\nI have never seen two bulls fight without first indulging in the usual\r\npreliminaries, that is, roaring and advancing a few yards and repeating\r\nthe performance till within striking distance. Then both animals rear\r\nhigh up, supporting themselves on the lower part of the body, and lunge\r\nsavagely with their whole weight each at his opponent's head or neck,\r\ntearing the thick skin with their teeth and causing the blood to flow\r\ncopiously. Several lunges of this kind generally finish the battle,\r\nwhereupon the beaten one drops to his flippers and makes all haste\r\ntowards the water, glancing fearfully behind him on the way. We have\r\nseen bulls with their snouts partly torn off and otherwise injured, but\r\nworse injuries must occur in the rare, desperate battles which sometimes\r\ntake place between two very much enraged animals.\r\n\r\nWhen a bull in the centre of a rookery has occasion to rush at an\r\ninterloper, he does so without regard to anything in his way, going over\r\ncows and pups alike and very often crushing some of the latter to death.\r\nAgain, it seems as if all the outlying bulls recognize the noise of the\r\nrookery bull, because each time he roars they all lift up their heads\r\nand take notice, whereas others who have just been roaring have not\r\nthe slightest regard paid to them, except perhaps by one immediately\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe bull, during the breeding season, will on provocation attack a man,\r\nand it is surprising how quickly the former covers the ground. But on\r\nthe whole he is an inoffensive animal. It is, of course, impossible to\r\nventure into a rookery, as the cows are very savage when they have the\r\npups with them, but one can approach within a few yards of its outskirts\r\nwithout danger. Their food consists of cuttlefish, crabs and fish,\r\nand it is probable that they frequent the ocean where this food is\r\nplentiful, when they are absent from the island.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that these animals are nearly extinct, but a visit to\r\nMacquarie Island during the breeding season would be enough to convince\r\nanybody to the contrary. There are thousands of them, and though about\r\nseven hundred are killed during a season, the increase in numbers each\r\nyear, on Macquarie Island alone, must be very great.\r\n\r\nThe skuas were now returning to the island and their numbers and\r\ncorresponding clamour were daily increasing. They were the noisiest and\r\nmost quarrelsome birds we had, but their advent, we hoped, marked the\r\nreturn of less rigorous weather.\r\n\r\nBlake left for Lusitania Bay on the 17th, intending to spend several\r\nmonths there in order to survey and geologically examine the southern\r\nend, so we gave him a send-off dinner. He had a very rough trip to the\r\nplace, having to spend two nights in a cave about six miles from his\r\ndestination, as a result of getting lost in a dense fog.\r\n\r\nHamilton made a wire fish-trap to replace the one which he had lost, and\r\nsucceeded in getting a few fish on lowering it for the first time. He\r\ndiscovered parasitical mites all over them on the outside, and the flesh\r\ncontained many worms.\r\n\r\nA heavy north-north-west gale was experienced on the 26th, but the\r\nweather during the last three days of August was very quiet, either\r\ncalms or light winds prevailing, and we took the opportunity to do some\r\nwork on Wireless Hill. All the wire stays were tightened, and various\r\nropes which appeared to require attention were renewed, while, as a\r\nfinal improvement, the aerial was hauled as tight as we could make it.\r\n\r\nWe heard on July 31 that the 'Rachel Cohen', a sealing-vessel, had\r\nsailed for Macquarie Island and was bringing a few articles for us,\r\nso there was something to which we could look forward in the immediate\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature of the month's weather was the wind, as\r\ngales blew on eleven days, and on seven other days the velocity reached\r\ntwenty-five miles per hour. Precipitation occurred on twenty-seven\r\ndays, and the average percentage of cloud was eighty-four. The mean\r\ntemperature was 38.1 degrees with extremes of 45.3 degrees and 26\r\ndegrees F. A prolonged display of auroral light occurred on the night\r\nof the 17th, though no colours other than the light lemon-yellow of the\r\narch and streamers could be seen.\r\n\r\nBull elephants were now arriving in great numbers, and these monsters\r\ncould be seen lying everywhere on the isthmus, both up in the tussock,\r\non the beaches, and among the heaps of kelp. Now and again one would\r\nlazily lift a flipper to scratch itself or heave its great bulk into a\r\nmore comfortable position.\r\n\r\nThe island is the habitat of two kinds of night-birds, one kind--a\r\nspecies of petrel (Lesson's)--being much larger than the other, both\r\nliving in holes in the ground. They fly about in the darkness, their\r\ncries resembling those made by a beaten puppy. The smaller bird\r\n(apparently indigenous and a new species) was occasionally seen flying\r\nover the water during the day, but the larger ones come out almost\r\nexclusively at night. A light attracts them and Hamilton, with the aid\r\nof a lantern and a butterfly-net, tried to catch some. Others swooped\r\nabout, well out of range, shrieking the while in an uncanny way. Numbers\r\nof them were secured afterwards by being dug out of their holes, Mac\r\nbeing just as keen to locate them as Hamilton was to secure them. They\r\ncannot see well during the day, and seem to have almost lost the use of\r\ntheir feet. They lay two small, white, thin-shelled eggs at the end of\r\ntheir burrow; and in certain parts of the island, where the burrows are\r\nnumerous, the sound made by hundreds of them at once, during the nesting\r\nseason, somewhat resembles that made by a high-power Marconi wireless\r\nset at close range.\r\n\r\nBefore Blake left Lusitania Bay, I promised to see that the hut on Sandy\r\nBay was re-stocked with provisions by the middle of the month, so, on\r\nthe 8th, Hamilton, Sandell and I carried a supply of stores down there,\r\nleaving a note which informed him that we expected the 'Rachel Cohen' to\r\narrive any day, and asking him to return to the Shack. On the way down\r\nwe came upon a vast quantity of wreckage piled up on the beach, midway\r\nbetween \"The Nuggets\" and Sandy Bay. This was all that remained of the\r\nsealing schooner, 'Jessie Nichol', which had been wrecked on December\r\n21, 1910. Three men were drowned, their bodies being interred among the\r\ntussock, each marked by a life belt and a small board on which the name\r\nwas roughly carved.\r\n\r\nOn our homeward trip we caught some wekas for the pot and duly arrived\r\nat the Shack, tired, wet and hungry.\r\n\r\nNext day, while sitting in the Shack reducing records, I heard a yell\r\nfrom Hamilton to the effect that the 'Rachel Cohen' was in sight, and\r\nabout an hour later she dropped anchor in North-East Bay.\r\n\r\nThe sea was fairly smooth and no time was lost in bringing a boat ashore\r\nwith the mails, of which each man received a share. A gang of sealers\r\nwas landed with a view to obtaining sea elephant and penguin oil. I\r\nhad wirelessed asking for a dinghy to be sent down, which would enable\r\nHamilton to do more marine work; and it now came to hand. Further, we\r\nreceived an additional supply of photographic material and some rubber\r\ntubing for the anemometer, but the much needed boots did not arrive.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th a strong southerly gale sprang up and compelled the 'Rachel\r\nCohen' to seek safety in flight; so she slipped her cable and put to\r\nsea. She had not yet landed all the sealers' stores and was forced to\r\nhang about the island till the weather moderated sufficiently for her to\r\nreturn to an anchorage.\r\n\r\nThe gentoo penguins, which had been observed at the beginning of the\r\nmonth building their nests, commenced to lay, and the first ten eggs\r\nwere collected by us on September 18. Many sea elephant rookeries were\r\nnow well-formed as the cows began to arrive about the 11th and were soon\r\nlanding in large numbers. The first pups were heard on the 20th, and\r\nBauer and I walked along to the rookery from which the barking came and\r\nhad a look at the newcomers. There were only four, none of which was\r\nmore than a few hours old, but they yapped their displeasure, and the\r\nmothers made frantic lunges at us when we approached to get a close view\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe sealers always gave the animals time to form their rookeries and\r\nthen killed the bulls for oil. A well-conditioned full-grown animal\r\nyields about half a tun of oil, and as the commodity when refined has\r\na market value of from L20 to L25 per tun, it will be seen that the\r\nindustry is a profitable one. The cows being small never have a very\r\nthick coating of blubber, but I have seen bulls with blubber to a depth\r\nof eight inches, and some of them yield nearly two thousand pounds,\r\nthough I should estimate the average yield at about one thousand one\r\nhundred pounds. The sealers in the early days used to obtain the oil\r\nby cutting the blubber up into very small pieces and melting it down\r\nin \"try \" pots. These pots, many of which may be still seen about the\r\nisland, were made of very thick iron and the fuel used was the refuse\r\ntaken from the pot itself. In the present method steam digestors are\r\nused, and the oil from the melted blubber is drawn off, after steam\r\nhas been passing for twelve hours. Coal is brought down by the\r\nsealing-vessel to be used as fuel. The \"elephant season\" lasts only\r\nabout three months, and within about four weeks of its conclusion, the\r\n\"penguin season\" begins; the same gang of men being employed as a rule.\r\nThe most difficult operation in connexion with both of these industries\r\nis undoubtedly the loading and unloading of the vessel. If auxiliary\r\npower were used, the ship could then steam to within half a mile of the\r\nshore, but as it is, a sailing-vessel has to anchor about two miles off\r\nand the oil is towed in rafts over that distance.\r\n\r\nWe heard sounds from Adelie Land wireless station for the first time\r\non September 25, 1912, but the signals were very faint and all that we\r\ncould receive was: \"Please inform Pennant Hills.\" Sawyer called them\r\nrepeatedly for several hours, but heard no acknowledgment. Every effort\r\nwas made to get in touch with them from this time forward, Sawyer\r\nremaining at the instrument until daylight every morning.\r\n\r\nThe Royal penguins returned to the island on the 27th and immediately\r\ncommenced to make their way to the rookeries. They had been absent since\r\nApril and were very fat after their long migration.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th Blake and Hamilton started out in the dinghy for Lusitania\r\nBay. They had already made a step and sprit, and, with a calico sail\r\nhoisted, the frail craft ran before a light breeze. Having a fair wind\r\nthey made good headway along the coast, dropping in at a gentoo penguin\r\nrookery en route, and collecting about two hundred and twenty eggs. Mac\r\nwas a passenger and was a very sick dog all the trip.\r\n\r\nShortly after their departure, the 'Rachel Cohen', which had been blown\r\naway on the 18th, reappeared and again anchored. The captain reported\r\nhaving seen numerous icebergs, some of which were very large, about\r\nthirty miles to the eastward of the island. The sealers immediately\r\ncommenced to get away the rest of their stores and coal and also to put\r\nsome oil aboard the vessel, but on the following day the wind increased\r\nto such an extent that, in attempting to reach the ship with a raft of\r\noil, they were blown down the coast and had to beach the boat several\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 29th Adelie Land wireless station was again heard\r\ntapping out a message apparently with the hope that some station would\r\nreceive it. All we got was: \"Having a hell of a time waiting for calm\r\nweather to put up more masts.\" Sawyer again repeatedly called, but they\r\nevidently could not hear him as no reply was received, and the above\r\nmessage was repeated time after time.\r\n\r\nThe weather during September was not quite so rough as that of the\r\nprevious two or three months, but misty days were very frequent. Gales\r\nwere experienced on six days and strong winds on nine days, but several\r\nquiet periods occurred. The average temperature was 38.6 degrees, with\r\nextremes of 44.7 degrees and 26 degrees F.\r\n\r\nOctober was ushered in by a strong gale and rather heavy rain-squalls.\r\nThe 'Rachel Cohen' had a severe buffeting, though she was lying on the\r\nlee side of the island.\r\n\r\nJust about three-quarters of a mile to the west of the Shack were two\r\nlarge sea elephant rookeries, very close to each other, and on the 3rd\r\nSandell and I went along to see what was happening there. We found about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty cows in the nearer one, and, as closely as we\r\ncould count, about five hundred in the adjacent colony. The babel of\r\nsounds made one feel thankful that these noisy creatures were some\r\ndistance from the Shack. Nearly all the cows had pups, some of which\r\nhad reached a fair size, while others were only a few hours old. We saw\r\nseveral dead ones, crushed out almost flat, and some skuas were busily\r\nengaged gorging themselves on the carcases. These birds are indeed\r\nprofessional plunderers, and will venture almost anywhere in pursuit of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening we again heard Adelie Land station working, and the\r\nburden of their message to an apparently chance audience was: \"We do not\r\nseem able to get Macquarie Island, all is well, though bad weather has\r\nso far prevented any attempt at sledging.\"\r\n\r\nSawyer again called them at regular intervals for the rest of the night,\r\nbut, as before, got no response.\r\n\r\nHamilton and Blake were busy at Lusitania Bay during the first two weeks\r\nof October securing sea elephant specimens and collecting eggs. They\r\nvisited Caroline Cove where is established a giant petrel rookery\r\ncontaining about four hundred birds, and gathered a large number of\r\neggs--purely specimens, as they are no use otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe 'Rachel Cohen' finally left us on the 8th, expecting to pay another\r\nvisit in December for the purpose of taking off the sea elephant oil\r\nprocured by the sealers. Sandell and I visited the gentoo penguin colony\r\nin Aerial Cove during the afternoon, for the purpose of getting a few\r\neggs. We found plenty there and collected as many as we required. On\r\nreturning to the empty nests, the birds would first of all peer round\r\nto assure themselves that the eggs were really missing, and then throw\r\ntheir heads back, swaying them from side to side to the accompaniment of\r\nloud, discordant cries.\r\n\r\nSeveral of us started out on the 10th to visit the west coast for\r\nthe purpose of getting some wekas and, incidentally, to make any\r\nobservations possible. We saw thousands of sea elephants along the coast\r\nand passed many rookeries of various sizes. There were a large number of\r\nwekas about, but after shooting fourteen we were satisfied with our bag.\r\n\r\nA westerly gale during the night proved too much for the aerial, and\r\ndown it came. Blake and Hamilton were away, so Sawyer, Sandell and I\r\nwent up, and after much battling and frequent use of the \"handy billy\"\r\nsucceeded in fixing things. We also re-tightened the wire stays and\r\nthoroughly overhauled the ropes. Snow and sleet fell all the time,\r\nmaking the task most disagreeable.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the month the Royal penguins commenced to lay, and\r\non the 17th Sandell and I went to their rookeries at \"The Nuggets\" and\r\ncollected about fifteen dozen eggs, which we buried in a hole in the\r\nbank of the creek for preservation. This species of penguin is the one\r\nwhich is killed for oil, not because it is any fatter than the others,\r\nbut because it lives in such large colonies. There is one rookery of\r\nthese birds on the south end of the island which covers an area of\r\nsixteen and a half acres, whilst at \"The Nuggets\" there are numbers\r\nof them scattered along the banks of a creek which reaches the sea,\r\naggregating ten acres. At the latter place are situated the oil works\r\nbelonging to the sealers.\r\n\r\nFrom careful observation I should say that the number of birds killed\r\nduring the season would not total one hundred and fifty thousand. The\r\nmethod of killing--by blows from a heavy club--is about as humane as any\r\nthat could be adopted, and the yearly increase in numbers in the only\r\nrookeries that are being worked is certainly greater than the decrease\r\ndue to the depredations of the sealers. Apart from this, there are acres\r\nof rookeries on the island from which not a single bird is taken, and\r\nthey go on year after year adding thousands upon thousands to their\r\nalready vast numbers.\r\n\r\nThis species resembles the others in habits, and I shall not describe\r\nthem at any length. They are of the same colour as the Victoria\r\npenguins, but have a more orderly crest. Their rookeries are always on\r\nor very close to a running stream which forms the highway along\r\nwhich they travel to and fro. There is no policeman on duty, but a\r\nwell-ordered procession is somehow arranged whereby those going up keep\r\nto one side and those coming down keep to the other. Once they are in\r\nthe rookery, however, different conditions obtain. Here are fights,\r\nsquabbles and riots, arising from various causes, the chief of which\r\nappears to be a disposition on the part of some birds to loiter about.\r\nDuring the nesting time much disorder prevails, and fights, in which\r\nbeaks and flippers are energetically used, may be seen in progress\r\nat various places throughout the rookery. The nests are made of small\r\nstones, and occasionally, a bone or two from the skeleton of some\r\nlong-dead relative forms part of the bulwarks. The attempt on the part\r\nof some birds to steal stones from surrounding nests is about the most\r\nfruitful cause of a riot, and the thief generally gets soundly thrashed,\r\nbesides which all have a peck at him as he makes his way with as much\r\nhaste as possible from the danger-zone. As the season advances, these\r\nrookeries become covered with filthy slush, but it seems to make no\r\ndifference to the eggs, as the chicks appear in due course. When the\r\nmoulting process is in full swing the rookeries are very crowded, and\r\nfeathers and slush then become mixed together, making the place anything\r\nbut fragrant.\r\n\r\nA fifty-four mile gale from the west-north-west blew down on us on the\r\n20th, but shortly after noon it weakened, and, towards evening, with the\r\nshifting of the wind to southwest, came squalls of sleet and snow and a\r\ndrop in temperature. Hamilton returned from Lusitania Bay in the dinghy\r\non the 21st, but Blake stopped there as he had not yet finished his work\r\nin that locality. The dinghy was well laden with specimens of various\r\nkinds and, on the way up, some wood and pickets were left at Green\r\nValley for future requirements.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th Sandell and I visited the west coast, but, instead of going\r\nthe usual way, we walked down the east coast and went up the creek at\r\n\"The Nuggets\" with a view to having a look at the penguin colonies along\r\nits course, finally crossing over the hills and getting into another\r\ncreek, which we followed all the way down to the west coast. Along this\r\ncreek were numerous waterfalls, one of which was quite sixty feet in\r\nheight with wind-blown spray frozen white on the rocks on either side.\r\nWe came across several giant petrel rookeries, and were treated to a\r\ndisplay of the \"stinker's\" ability to make himself objectionable. A pair\r\nof sooty albatrosses were seen nesting on the front of a rocky steep,\r\nbut on climbing up we found that they had not yet laid. After catching\r\nsome wekas and taking a few photographs we returned to the Shack.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the month several of us crossed the hills to the west\r\ncoast in search of plants and birds' eggs. We secured a number of plant\r\nspecimens--a further sign of the arrival of spring--including two which\r\nbore a very small flower, and were most successful in obtaining skuas',\r\ngiant petrels' and sooty albatrosses' eggs.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening I received a message from Captain Davis stating that\r\nthe 'Aurora' would visit us in about three weeks' time and inquiring if\r\nwe needed any supplies. This was entirely unexpected, as we thought that\r\nno more would be seen of the Ship until she came to take us home at the\r\nend of March 1913.\r\n\r\nEarthquake shocks were felt at 1.55 A.M. and 9.35 A.M. on October 28,\r\nbut did no damage other than to bring down some loose rock. Auroral\r\ndisplays were rather frequent but not very pronounced, and in most cases\r\ncould only be classed as \"glows.\"\r\n\r\nA bright sunny morning on the 3rd induced Hamilton and me to make a\r\nphotographic excursion along the coast. Hitherto only still-life photos\r\nhad been taken, but with the sunlight we were then having, any work was\r\npossible, so we determined to have some \"shots\" at the sea elephants.\r\nThey were rather difficult subjects, strange to say, but we spent some\r\ntime amongst them and did famously, till a snow-squall made us suspend\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nWe heard the discordant but mournful cry of a sooty albatross coming\r\nfrom the cliff-front, so Hamilton climbed up and, after scrambling about\r\nfor a while, succeeded in finding a nest, which contained one egg. This\r\nled him to look along the cliffs fronting the east coast, and on the\r\nfollowing morning he found several nests and caught two birds, both of\r\nwhich were taken by hand while on the nest. They had beautiful plumage\r\nand made very fine specimens.\r\n\r\nBlake returned from Lusitania Bay during the afternoon of the 4th and\r\nreported that he required only four or five days to complete the survey.\r\nThe configuration of the island at the southern end is vastly different\r\nto that shown in the published charts, and this became more apparent as\r\nBlake's figures were plotted.\r\n\r\nThe news that Piastre had won the Melbourne Cup was flashed about all\r\nover the southern ocean during the evening, and we picked it up; but\r\nas this was the first we had heard of the animal, nobody seemed much\r\ninterested. It certainly gave a turn to the conversation, and quite\r\na sporting tone permeated the discussions of the ensuing two or three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of discussion were usually those of environment, and\r\nmost of our talk centred round sea elephants, sea-leopards, penguins,\r\ntemperatures, wind, wireless telegraphy, fish, aurorae, exploration,\r\nships, Queensland and New Zealand. Sea elephants and penguins do offer\r\nscope for a considerable amount of conversation, as one observes them\r\nunder such different circumstances, and they are so odd that something\r\nremarkable is always associated with the sight of them. The weather,\r\nbeing practically the bete noire of our existence, came in for a good\r\ndeal of abuse. Wireless telegraphy is a mighty interesting subject\r\nat all times, and we passed many hours of our stay in discussing its\r\nfuture. All the members were, allegedly, fishermen of some calibre, and\r\nwhen I have said that, anybody with a knowledge of the man who claims\r\nability as an angler will know what all the others, in turn, had to\r\nreceive with restrained and respectful admiration. The advantages of\r\nsettlement in Queensland were so apparent to at least one member of\r\nthe party that he simply could not understand why thousands were not\r\nannually killed in the rush to get to this, \"the greatest of all the\r\nAustralian States.\" Good old silky oak!\r\n\r\nThe scenery of New Zealand was almost as well known to us as to anybody\r\nwho has lived in the country all his life, and three of us had never\r\nbeen there. We have sat round the Shack sometimes and only the roar of a\r\nsea elephant outside reminded us that we were not, as we imagined, at a\r\nMaori \"tangi.\" The wages to be earned there, the delights of travelling,\r\nthe legislators, Rotorua, kauri pine, and the moon they've got in\r\nAuckland--we've heard of all these and marvelled at them. \"Kapai te\r\nMaori!\"\r\n\r\nBlake and Hamilton went to Sandy Bay in the dinghy on the 6th in order\r\nto complete some work. They improved the hut there, to the extent of\r\nmaking a fire-place and laying barrel-staves on the floor, afterwards\r\nbringing a boat-load of timber from the 'Jessie Nichol' wreck and\r\nrigging up a board bunk sufficiently large to accommodate both of them.\r\n\r\nWhile walking down to the 'Clyde' wreck for some wood on the 7th I saw\r\na strange bird on the beach, and, returning to the Shack for the gun,\r\nI got him at the second shot. He was a land bird and had evidently been\r\nblown out of his course, as none of his kind had been seen before on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nOn getting up on the following morning I found poor old Ma lying dead,\r\nand the feathers which lay about indicated that she had been the victim\r\nof a savage assault, but whether at the teeth of a dog or the beak of a\r\nskua I was unable to determine. This was most unfortunate, as the hens\r\nhad all started to lay again two days previously; but apart from this\r\nshe was a funny old creature and one could almost hold a conversation\r\nwith her, so we regretted her loss. However, to make amends for this\r\ndisaster the Victoria penguins started to lay on the same day, and as\r\nseveral of their rookeries were only a few minutes' walk from the Shack,\r\nthe position was much the same as if we owned a poultry farm.\r\n\r\nHamilton returned from Sandy Bay on the 17th and immediately set about\r\ncollecting shags' eggs. He visited Aerial Cove for the purpose but did\r\nnot get enough, and was compelled to go to West Point, where he gathered\r\ntwenty-four dozen for specimens. He now had a collection of eggs of all\r\nbirds which nest on the island, with the exception of the weka and the\r\ntern.\r\n\r\nAt 6.30 P.M. on November 22 the 'Aurora' steamed into North-East Bay\r\nand dropped anchor. Hamilton, Blake and Sawyer launched the dinghy\r\nand pulled out to receive the mails, which they brought ashore for\r\ndistribution. All on board were well and Captain Davis sent word to\r\nsay he would land in the morning, bringing our goods and some\r\nvisitors--Professor Flynn of Hobart and Mr. Denny.\r\n\r\nThe 'Aurora' next day steamed round North Head and took a series of\r\nsoundings between the main island and the Judge and Clerk. These latter\r\nislets lie about eight miles to the north of North Head, and are merely\r\nrocks about eighty feet high upon which thousands of shags and other\r\nbirds have established rookeries. On the following morning we said\r\ngood-bye to the Ship, which weighed anchor and steamed away, leaving us\r\nonce more to our own devices.\r\n\r\nAll the flowering plants were now showing their extremely modest blooms,\r\nand the tussock looked like a field of wheat, each stem having a decided\r\near. The gentoo penguins, as well as the giant petrels, had hatched\r\ntheir eggs, and the parent birds were shouldering full responsibilities.\r\n\r\nBlake and Hamilton were now prepared for another visit to the southern\r\nend. Blake had almost completed the chart of the island, and the\r\ndifference between it and the published chart was very striking. In the\r\nlatter case the south end was shown as being six miles wide, whereas it\r\nis in reality only a little more than two miles across, and the width\r\nof the island is nowhere more than three and a half miles. About twenty\r\nmiles from the southern end lie two islets known as the Bishop and\r\nClerk. The former, which is the larger, is covered with a growth of\r\ntussock, while the latter is mainly bare rock.\r\n\r\nA distinct rise in temperature was noticeable during November and the\r\nmean worked out at 41.6 degrees, while the extremes were 49 degrees\r\nand 82 degrees F. Strong winds were recorded on thirteen days and six\r\nshort-lived gales occurred. We had less precipitation than during any\r\nprevious month, as thirteen dry days were experienced. The average\r\ncloudiness was 93 per cent.; largely due to the frequent foggy or misty\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nOn December 2, at 10 A.M., Blake and I packed our sleeping-bags and\r\nblankets and started for Sandy Bay. The swags weighed only thirty-five\r\npounds each and we made a rather quick trip.\r\n\r\nAfter repairing the dilapidated shack, we sallied out for the purpose\r\nof catching our evening meal, and with the aid of Mac soon succeeded in\r\ngetting eight wekas. A sea elephant was then killed, and the blubber,\r\nheart and tongue taken; the first-named for use as fuel and the others\r\nfor food. We cleaned the wekas and put them in the pot, cooking the\r\nwhole lot together, a proceeding which enabled us to forgo cooking\r\na breakfast in the morning. The beach was swarming with young sea\r\nelephants and many could be seen playing about in a small, shallow\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\nJust south of the hut there is a sandy spit and one of the only\r\nstretches of beach on the island, where thousands of penguins from\r\nthe adjacent rookeries were congregated, amongst them being three King\r\npenguins, which were easily distinguishable on account of their great\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nFeeling a little weary, I sought the hut about 9 P.M. and turned into\r\nthe sleeping-bag, which was placed on a board bottom covered with\r\ntussock, which was by no means uncomfortable. The old place smoked so\r\nmuch that we decided to let the fire die down, and as soon as the smoke\r\nhad cleared away, the imperfections of the hut became apparent; rays of\r\nmoonlight streaming through countless openings in the walls and roof.\r\n\r\nWe rose at 6.30 A.M. While Blake lit the fire, I went out to fill the\r\nbilly at a small stream running out of the hills about sixty yards away.\r\nAfter breakfast we set out for Green Valley, but had not gone very far\r\nwhen it began to blow very hard from the south, straight in our faces,\r\nand we scrambled on towards our destination amidst squalls of snow, hail\r\nand sleet. Eventually we reached the valley and had a somewhat meagre\r\nlunch in a small cave. The title \"cave\" rather dignifies this hole\r\nin the rock, but it was the only friendly spot in a most inhospitable\r\nlocality, and we were inclined to be generous,\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the length of coast we had traversed was found to be as\r\nrough as any on the island. There is not a stretch of one hundred yards\r\nanywhere that can be termed \"good going.\" In many places we found that\r\nthe steep cliffs approached very close to the water, and the mournful\r\ncry of the sooty albatross could be heard coming from points high on the\r\nface of the cliffs, while the wekas were so tame that one could almost\r\nwalk up and catch them.\r\n\r\nA large creek whose banks are overhung with a coarse growth of fern\r\nmakes its way out of the hills and runs into Sandy Bay. Just a little\r\nto the south of this creek Blake discovered a terminal moraine about two\r\nhundred yards in length and fifty feet wide. It rests on sandstone about\r\nfifteen feet above the present sea-level and the boulders consist of\r\npolished and sub-angular blocks of sandstone and porphyry of various\r\nsizes. It evidently belongs to the valley or to a later stage of\r\nglaciation. The rocks along the coast are all a volcanic series, and\r\nbasic dykes are visible in many places.\r\n\r\nWe arose at 7 A.M. next day and breakfasted on porridge, weka, fried\r\nheart, \"hard-tack\" and cocoa. Leaving the hut shortly afterwards we\r\nclimbed on to the hills and travelled south for several miles in order\r\nto fix the position of some lakes and creeks. There was one lake in the\r\nvicinity about half a mile long and to all appearances very deep. It lay\r\nbetween two steep hills, and the grassy bank at one end and the small\r\nsloping approach at the other gave it an artificial appearance, while\r\nthe water was beautifully clear and perfectly fresh. At the sloping end,\r\ndozens of skuas were busily engaged washing themselves and the flapping\r\nof their wings in the water made a remarkable noise, audible at a\r\nconsiderable distance on the hill-tops. On returning to the hut at Sandy\r\nBay several rabbits secured by Mac were cleaned and put on to boil.\r\n\r\nNext morning a dense mist shrouded the island till about 11 A.M., but\r\nthe weather becoming fine and bright, we started for the west coast\r\nabout noon. During our progress along the bed of a creek, Blake\r\ndiscovered what was believed to be a glacial deposit containing fossil\r\nbones, and considerable time was spent in examining this and attempting\r\nto extract whole specimens, thereby making it too late to proceed to the\r\nwest. On returning to the hut we decided to pack the swags. We reached\r\nhome just in time for tea, finding that nothing unusual had occurred\r\nduring our four days' absence.\r\n\r\nHamilton and Blake went out fishing in the dinghy on the 9th and made\r\na remarkable haul of fish, sixty in number, ranging in size from a few\r\nounces to twelve and a half pounds. They were all of the same species,\r\nsomewhat resembling rock cod, but as usual they were covered with\r\nexternal parasites, and their flesh was full of worm-cysts. Hamilton\r\npreserved a number of them and the rest were cooked, but we did not\r\nrelish them very much and the one meal was enough.\r\n\r\nOn December 11 we had a hard gale all day, the anemometer recording\r\n\"bursts\" of over fifty miles an hour frequently, while the average\r\nexceeded forty miles an hour throughout. Twelve months ago on that\r\nday we had made our first landing on the island from the 'Aurora', but\r\nvastly different weather conditions prevailed at the time.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day was now very close at hand, and as Blake and Hamilton were\r\ngoing to celebrate at the other end of the island, whence they had\r\ngone on the 10th, Sawyer, Sandell and I arranged a little \"spread\" for\r\nourselves. Sawyer produced a cake which he had received in the recent\r\nmail, and some friend had forwarded a plum pudding to Sandell, so on\r\nChristmas Day these, with a boiled ham, some walnuts, mince rolls and a\r\nbottle of stout were spread on the table, which had been decorated\r\nwith tussock stuck in sea elephants' tusks. The highest temperature\r\nregistered on the island during our stay--51.8 degrees F.--was recorded\r\non Christmas Day, and the sun seemed so warm that Sandell and I ventured\r\ninto the sea for a dip, but the temperature of the water was not high\r\nenough to make it an agreeable experience.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening of the 26th we received a message saying that the\r\n'Aurora' had left Hobart on her trip south to bring back the two parties\r\nfrom Antarctica, but no mention of picking us up on the return journey\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nThe King penguins and \"night birds\" had laid by this time, and Hamilton\r\nadded more eggs to his collection. He found for the first time a colony\r\nof mutton birds near the south end. He also came upon a mollymawk\r\nrookery on the south-western point of the island, and managed to take\r\none of the birds by hand.\r\n\r\nBlake and he had an accident in the dinghy on the 29th, fortunately\r\nattended by no serious results. They had gone from Lusitania Bay to\r\nthe south end, and, while attempting to land through the surf, the boat\r\nstruck a rock and capsized, throwing them into the water. They had many\r\nthings in the boat but lost only two billies, two pannikins, a sounding\r\nline and Hamilton's hat, knife and pipe. Their blankets floated ashore\r\nin a few minutes, and the oars came floating in later in the day. After\r\nthe capsize Hamilton managed to reach the boat and turn her over, and\r\nBlake made for a kelp-hung rock, but, after pulling himself up on to\r\nit, was immediately washed off and had to swim ashore. The boat was\r\nafterwards found to be stove-in in two places, though the breaks were\r\neasily patched up subsequently.\r\n\r\nNew Year's Eve came and with keen anticipations we welcomed the advent\r\nof 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII THROUGH ANOTHER YEAR\r\n\r\nby G. F. Ainsworth\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had now thrown a year behind and the work we set out to accomplish\r\nwas almost finished; so it was with pleasurable feelings that we took up\r\nthe burden of completion, looking forward to the arrival of April 1913\r\nwhich should bring us final relief and the prospects of civilisation. I\r\nshall deal with the first three months of the year as one period, since\r\nalmost all the field-work, except photography, had been done, and, after\r\nthe return of Blake and Hamilton from Lusitania Bay on January 8,\r\nour life was one of routine; much time being devoted to packing and\r\nlabelling specimens in anticipation of departure.\r\n\r\nThe first business of the year was to overhaul the wireless station, and\r\non the 6th, Sawyer, Sandell and I spent the day laying in a supply of\r\nbenzine from Aerial Cove, changing worn ropes, tightening stay-wires,\r\nstraightening the southern masts and finally hauling the aerial taut.\r\nThese duties necessitated much use of the \"handy billy,\" and one has\r\nbut to form an acquaintance with this desirable \"person\" to thoroughly\r\nappreciate his value.\r\n\r\nBlake and Hamilton returned on January 8 and reported that their work\r\nwas finished at the southern end. Thenceforth they intended to devote\r\ntheir time to finishing what remained to be done at the northern end and\r\nin adding to their collections. Blake, for instance, resolved to finish\r\nhis chart of the island, and, if time permitted, to make a topographical\r\nsurvey of the locality, as it was of great geological interest. Hamilton\r\nmade the discovery that a number of bird specimens he had packed away\r\nwere mildewed, and as a result he was compelled to overhaul the whole\r\nlot and attend to them. He found another colony of mutton birds on North\r\nHead, the existence of which was quite unexpected till he dug one out of\r\na burrow thought to contain \"night-birds.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of January I endeavoured to do a little meteorological\r\nwork with the aid of some box-kites manufactured by Sandell. But though\r\na number of them were induced to fly, we had no success in getting\r\nthem up with the instruments attached. They all had a habit of suddenly\r\nlosing equilibrium and then indulging in a series of rapid dives and\r\nplunges which usually ended in total wreckage.\r\n\r\nThe 'Rachel Cohen' again visited the island on January 26, but this time\r\nshe anchored off \"The Nuggets,\" whither the sealers had gone to live\r\nduring the penguin season. We could see the ship lying about a mile\r\noffshore, and walked down to get our mails and anything else she had\r\nbrought along for us. I received a letter from the Secretary of the\r\nExpedition saying that he had made arrangements for us to return by the\r\n'Rachel Cohen' early in April, and the news caused a little excitement,\r\nbeing the only definite information we had had concerning relief.\r\n\r\nThe end of the first month found Blake and Hamilton both very busy in\r\nmaking suitable boxes for specimens. Many of the larger birds could not\r\nbe packed in ordinary cases, so Hamilton had to make specially large\r\nones to accommodate them, and Blake's rock specimens being very heavy,\r\nextra strong boxes had to be made, always keeping in view the fact\r\nthat each was to weigh not more than eighty pounds, so as to ensure\r\nconvenient handling.\r\n\r\nAfter a silence of about four months, we again heard Adelie Land on\r\nFebruary 3, but the same old trouble existed, that is, they could not\r\nhear us. Sawyer called them again and again, getting no reply, but we\r\nreckoned that conditions would improve in a few weeks, as the hours of\r\ndarkness increased.\r\n\r\nHamilton and I made a trip to the hill-tops on the 4th for the purpose\r\nof taking a series of plant and earth temperatures which were of\r\ninterest biologically, and while there I took the opportunity of\r\nobtaining temperatures in all the lakes we saw. Hamilton also took some\r\npanoramic photographs from the various eminences and all of them turned\r\nout well.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening Adelie Land sent out a message saying that Dr. Mawson\r\nhad not yet returned to the Base from his sledging trip and Sawyer\r\nreceived it without difficulty, but though he \"pounded away\" in return\r\nfor a considerable time, he was not heard, as no reply or acknowledgment\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nThe 'Rachel Cohen' remained till the 5th, when a northerly gale arose\r\nand drove her away. As she had a good cargo of oil on board no one\r\nexpected her to return. We had sent our mail on board several days\r\npreviously as experience had shown us that the sailing date of ships\r\nvisiting the island was very uncertain.\r\n\r\nSandell met with a slight though painful accident on the 7th. He was\r\nstarting the engine, when it \"backfired\" and the handle flying off with\r\ngreat force struck him on the face, inflicting a couple of nasty cuts,\r\nloosening several teeth, and lacerating the inside of his cheek. A black\r\neye appeared in a day or two and his face swelled considerably, but\r\nnothing serious supervened. In a few days the swelling had subsided and\r\nany anxiety we felt was at an end.\r\n\r\nWe now had only two sheep left, and on the 8th Blake and I went to kill\r\none. Mac accompanied us. Seeing the sheep running away, she immediately\r\nset off after them, notwithstanding our threats, yells and curses. They\r\ndisappeared over a spur, but shortly afterwards Mac returned, and, being\r\nseverely thrashed, immediately left for home. We looked for the sheep\r\nduring the rest of the day but could find no trace of them, and though\r\nwe searched for many days it was not till five weeks had elapsed that we\r\ndiscovered them on a small \"landing\" about half-way down the face of the\r\ncliff. They had apparently rushed over the edge and, rolling down, had\r\nfinally come to a stop on the ledge where they were found later, alive\r\nand well.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th Adelie Land was heard by us calling the 'Aurora' to return\r\nat once and pick up the rest of the party, stating also that Lieutenant\r\nNinnis and Dr. Mertz were dead. All of us were shocked at the grievous\r\nintelligence and every effort was made by Sawyer to call up Adelie Land,\r\nbut without success.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we received news from Australia of the disaster to\r\nCaptain Scott's party.\r\n\r\nBlake, who was now geologizing and doing topographical work, discovered\r\nseveral lignite seams in the hills on the east coast; he had finished\r\nhis chart of the island. The mainland is simply a range of mountains\r\nwhich have been at some remote period partly submerged. The land meets\r\nthe sea in steep cliffs and bold headlands, whose general height is from\r\nfive hundred to seven hundred feet, with many peaks ranging from nine\r\nhundred and fifty to one thousand four hundred and twenty feet, the\r\nlatter being the height of Mount Hamilton, which rears up just at the\r\nback of Lusitania Bay. Evidence of extreme glaciation is everywhere\r\napparent, and numerous tarns and lakes are scattered amongst the hills,\r\nthe tops of which are barren, wind-swept and weather-worn. The hill\r\nsides are deeply scored by ravines, down which tumble small streams,\r\nforming cascades at intervals on their hurried journey towards the\r\nocean. Some of these streams do not reach the sea immediately, but\r\ndisappear in the loose shingly beaches of peaty swamps. The west coast\r\nis particularly rugged, and throughout its length is strewn wreckage of\r\nvarious kinds, some of which is now one hundred yards from the water's\r\nedge. Very few stretches of what may be called \"beach\" occur on the\r\nisland; the foreshores consisting for the most part of huge water-worn\r\nboulders or loose gravel and shingle, across which progress is slow and\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nA Section across Macquarie Island through Mt. Elder\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently the ground shelves very rapidly under the water, as a\r\nsounding of over two thousand fathoms was obtained by the 'Aurora' at a\r\ndistance of eight miles from the east coast. The trend of the island is\r\nabout eleven degrees from true north; the axis lying north by east to\r\nsouth by west. At either end are the island-groups already referred to,\r\nand their connexion with the mainland may be traced by the sunken rocks\r\nindicated by the breaking seas on the line of reef.\r\n\r\nA very severe storm about the middle of the month worked up a tremendous\r\nsea, which was responsible for piling hundreds of tons of kelp on the\r\nshore, and for several days tangled masses could be seen drifting about\r\nlike small floating islands.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th an event occurred to which we had long looked forward, and\r\nwhich was now eagerly welcomed. Communication was established with the\r\nMain Base in Adelie Land by wireless! A message was received from Dr.\r\nMawson confirming the deaths of Ninnis and Mertz, and stating that the\r\n'Aurora' had not picked up the whole party. Sawyer had a short talk with\r\nJeffryes, the Adelie Land operator, and among other scraps of news told\r\nhim we were all well.\r\n\r\nHamilton killed a sea elephant on the 22nd. The animal was a little over\r\nseventeen feet long and thirteen and a half feet in girth just at the\r\nback of the flippers, while the total weight was more than four tons.\r\nIt took Hamilton about a day to complete the skinning, and, during the\r\nprocess, the huge brute had to be twice turned over, but such is the\r\nvalue of the nautical handy-billy that two men managed it rather easily.\r\nWhen the skin had been removed, five of us dragged it to the sealers'\r\nblubber-shed, where it was salted, spread out, and left to cure.\r\n\r\nWe had communication with Adelie Land again on the 26th, and messages\r\nwere sent and received by both stations. Dr. Mawson wirelessed to the\r\neffect that the 'Aurora' would, after picking up Wild's party, make an\r\nattempt to return to Adelie Land if conditions were at all favourable.\r\n\r\nFinding that provisions were running rather short on the last day of\r\nFebruary, we reduced ourselves to an allowance of one pound of sugar per\r\nweek each, which was weighed out every Thursday. Altogether there were\r\nonly forty-five pounds remaining. Thenceforth it was the custom for each\r\nto bring his sugar-tin to the table every meal. The arrangement had its\r\ndrawbacks, inasmuch as no sugar was available for cooking unless a levy\r\nwere made. Thus puddings became rareties, because most of us preferred\r\nto use the sugar in tea or coffee.\r\n\r\nMarch came blustering in, accompanied by a sixty-four-mile gale which\r\ndid damage to the extent of blowing down our annexe, tearing the\r\ntarpaulin off the stores at the back and ripping the spouting off\r\nthe Shack. A high sea arose and the conformation of the beach on the\r\nnorth-western side of the isthmus was completely changed. Numbers of sea\r\nelephants' tusks and bones were revealed, which had remained buried in\r\nthe shingle probably for many years, and heaps of kelp were piled up\r\nwhere before there had been clean, stony beach. Kelp is a very tough\r\nweed, but after being washed up and exposed to the air for a few days,\r\nbegins to decay, giving forth a most disagreeable smell.\r\n\r\nAt this time we caught numerous small fish amongst the rocks at the\r\nwater's edge with a hand line about four feet long. It was simply a\r\nmatter of dropping in the line, watching the victim trifle with destiny\r\nand hauling him in at the precise moment.\r\n\r\nWireless business was now being done nightly with Adelie Land, and on\r\nthe 7th I received a message from Dr. Mawson saying that the party would\r\nin all probability be down there for another season, and stating the\r\nnecessity for keeping Macquarie Island station going till the end of the\r\nyear. This message I read out to the men, and gave them a week in which\r\nto view the matter. The alternatives were to return in April or to\r\nremain till the end of the year.\r\n\r\nI went through the whole of the stores on the 10th, and found that the\r\nonly commodities upon which we would have to draw sparingly were milk,\r\nsugar, kerosene, meats and coal. The flour would last till May, but the\r\nbutter allowance would have to be reduced to three pounds per week.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 12th that we found the lost sheep, but as we had some\r\nwekas, sufficient to last us for several days, I did not kill one till\r\nthe 15th. On that day four of us went down towards the ledge where they\r\nwere standing, and shot one, which immediately toppled off and rolled\r\ndown some distance into the tussock, the other one leaping after it\r\nwithout hesitation. While Blake and Hamilton skinned the dead sheep,\r\nSandell and I caught the other and tethered it at the bottom of the hill\r\namongst a patch of Maori cabbage, as we thought it would probably get\r\nlost if left to roam loose. However, on going to the spot next day, the\r\nsheep was nearly dead, having got tangled up in the rope. So we let it\r\ngo free, only to lose the animal a day or two later, for it fell into a\r\nbog and perished.\r\n\r\nOn March 22 a lunar eclipse occurred, contact lasting a little over\r\nthree hours from 9.45 P.M. till within a few minutes of 1 A.M. on the\r\n23rd. The period of total eclipse was quite a lengthy one, and during\r\nthe time it lasted the darkness was intense. Cloud interfered for a\r\nwhile with our observations in the total stage. No coronal effect was\r\nnoted, though a pulsating nebulous area appeared in front of the moon\r\njust before contact.\r\n\r\nA message came on the 27th saying that the 'Rachel Cohen' was sailing\r\nfor Macquarie Island on May 2, and would bring supplies as well as take\r\nback the men who wished to be relieved, and this was forwarded in turn\r\nto Dr. Mawson.\r\n\r\nHe replied, saying that the 'Aurora' would pick us up about the middle\r\nof November and convey us to Antarctica, thence returning to Australia;\r\nbut if any member wished to return by the 'Rachel Cohen' he could do\r\nso, though notification would have to be given, in order to allow of\r\nsubstitutes being appointed. All the members of the party elected to\r\nstay, and I asked each man to give an outline of the work he intended to\r\npursue during the extended period.\r\n\r\nDuring March strong winds were recorded on fourteen days, reaching\r\ngale-force on six occasions. The gale at the beginning of the month was\r\nthe strongest we had experienced, the velocity at 5.40 A.M. on the 1st\r\nreaching sixty-four miles per hour. Precipitation occurred on twenty-six\r\ndays and the average amount of cloud was 85 per cent. A bright auroral\r\ndisplay took place on the 6th, lasting from 11.20 till 11.45 P.M.\r\nIt assumed the usual arch-form stretching from the south-east to\r\nsouth-west, and streamers and shafts of light could be observed\r\npulsating upwards towards the zenith.\r\n\r\nWe now started on what might be called the second stage of our existence\r\non the island. In the preceding pages I have endeavoured to give some\r\nidea of what happened during what was to have been our full period;\r\nbut unforeseen circumstances compelled us to extend our stay for eight\r\nmonths more, until the 'Aurora' came to relieve us in November. As the\r\nroutine was similar in a good many respects to that which we had just\r\ngone through, I shall now refer to only the more salient features of our\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of my fellows was undoubted, and though any of them could\r\nhave returned if he had felt so inclined, I am proud to say that they\r\nall decided to see it through. When one has looked forward hopefully to\r\nbetter social conditions, more comfortable surroundings and reunion\r\nwith friends, it gives him a slight shock to find that the door has been\r\nslammed, so to speak, for another twelve months. Nevertheless, we all\r\nfound that a strain of philosophy smoothed out the rough realities, and\r\nin a short time were facing the situation with composure, if not actual\r\ncontentment.\r\n\r\nWe decided now to effect a few improvements round about our abode, and\r\nall set to work carrying gravel from the beach to put down in front of\r\nthe Shack, installing a sink-system to carry any waste water, fixing the\r\nleaking roof and finally closing up the space between the lining and the\r\nwall to keep out the rats.\r\n\r\nWe expected the 'Rachel Cohen' to leave Hobart with our stores on May 2,\r\nand reckoned that the voyage would occupy two weeks. Thus, it would be\r\nsix weeks before she arrived. I was therefore compelled on the 10th to\r\nreduce the sugar allowance to half a pound per week. We were now taking\r\nit in turns to go once a week and get some wekas, and it was always\r\npossible to secure about a dozen, which provided sufficient meat for\r\nthree dinners. Breakfast consisted generally of fish, which we caught,\r\nor sea elephant in some form, whilst we had tinned fish for lunch.\r\n\r\nSandell installed a telephone service between the Shack and the wireless\r\nstation about the middle of April, the parts all being made by himself;\r\nand it was certainly an ingenious and valuable contrivance. I, in\r\nparticular, learned to appreciate the convenience of it as time went\r\non. The buzzer was fixed on the wall close to the head of my bunk and\r\nI could be called any time during the night from the wireless station,\r\nthus rendering it possible to reply to communications without loss of\r\ntime. Further, during the winter nights, when auroral observations had\r\nto be made, I could retire if nothing showed during the early part of\r\nthe night, leaving it to Sandell, who worked till 2 or 3 A.M. to call me\r\nif any manifestation occurred.\r\n\r\nWe had heavy gales from the 12th to the 17th inclusive, the force of the\r\nwind during the period frequently exceeding fifty miles per hour, and,\r\non the first-mentioned date, the barometer fell to 27.8 inches. The\r\nusual terrific seas accompanied the outburst.\r\n\r\nFinding that there were only eight blocks of coal left, I reduced the\r\nweekly allowance to one. We had a good supply of tapioca, but neither\r\nrice nor sago, and as the sealers had some of the latter two, but none\r\nof the former, we made an exchange to the extent of twelve pounds of\r\ntapioca for eight pounds of rice and some sago. Only fifteen pounds of\r\nbutter remained on the 20th, and I divided this equally, as it was now\r\none of the luxuries, and each man could use his own discretion in eating\r\nit. As it was nearing the end of April, and no further word concerning\r\nthe movements of the 'Rachel Cohen' had been received, I wirelessed\r\nasking to be immediately advised of the exact date of the vessel's\r\ndeparture. A reply came that the ship would definitely reach us within\r\ntwo months. I answered, saying we could wait two months, but certainly\r\nno longer.\r\n\r\nWith a view to varying the menu a little, Blake and I took Mac up on the\r\nhills on April 26 to get some rabbits and, after tramping for about six\r\nhours, we returned with seven. In our wanderings we visited the penguin\r\nrookeries at \"The Nuggets,\" and one solitary bird sat in the centre\r\nof the vast area which had so lately been a scene of much noise and\r\ncontention.\r\n\r\nOn May 1 I took an inventory of the stores and found that they would\r\nlast for two months if economically used. Of course, I placed confidence\r\nin the statement that the 'Rachel Cohen' would reach the island within\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of May wintry conditions set in, and at the end of the\r\nfirst week the migrants had deserted our uninviting island. Life with us\r\nwent on much the same as usual, but the weather was rather more severe\r\nthan that during the previous year, and we were confined to the Shack a\r\ngood deal.\r\n\r\nThe sealers who were still on the island had shifted back to the Hut\r\nat the north end so that they were very close to us and frequently came\r\nover with their dog in the evenings to have a yarn. The majority of them\r\nwere men who had \"knocked about\" the world and had known many rough,\r\nadventurous years. One of them in particular was rather fluent, and we\r\nwere often entertained from his endless repertoire of stories.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd, finding that there were seventy-seven and a half pounds\r\nof flour remaining, and ascertaining that the sealers could let us have\r\ntwenty-five pounds, if we ran short, I increased the allowance for bread\r\nto twelve and a half pounds per week, and this, when made up, gave each\r\nman two and three-quarter pounds of bread. Our supply of oatmeal was\r\nvery low, but in order to make it last we now started using a mixture of\r\noatmeal and sago for breakfast; of course, without any milk or sugar.\r\n\r\nJust about this time Mac gave birth to six pups and could not help us in\r\nobtaining food. She had done valuable service in this connexion, and the\r\nloss in the foraging strength of the party was severely felt for several\r\nweeks. She was particularly deadly in hunting rabbits and wekas, and\r\nthough the first-named were very scarce within a few miles of the Shack,\r\nshe always managed to unearth one or two somewhere. Hut-slippers were\r\nmade out of the rabbit skins and they were found to be a great boon, one\r\nbeing able to sit down for a while without his feet \"going.\"\r\n\r\nJune arrived and with it much rough, cold weather. A boat was expected\r\nto come to our relief, at the very latest, by the 30th. We had a\r\nvery chilly period during the middle of the month, and it was only by\r\nhand-feeding the \"jacket\" of the wireless motor that any work could be\r\ndone by the station, as the tank outside was almost frozen solid.\r\n\r\nThe tide-gauge clock broke down towards the end of the month, and\r\nthough I tried for days to get it going I was not successful. One of the\r\nsprings had rusted very badly as a result of the frequent \"duckings\" the\r\nclock had experienced, and had become practically useless.\r\n\r\nWe had ascertained that the 'Rachel Cohen' was still in Hobart, so on\r\nthe 23rd I wirelessed asking when the boat was to sail. The reply came\r\nthat the 'Rachel Cohen' was leaving Hobart on Thursday, June 26.\r\n\r\nOur supply of kerosene oil was exhausted by the end of the month,\r\ndespite the fact that the rule of \"lights out at 10 P.M.\" had been\r\nobserved for some time. Thus we were obliged to use sea elephant oil in\r\nslush lamps. At first we simply filled a tin with the oil and passed\r\na rag through a cork floating on the top, but a little ingenuity soon\r\nresulted in the production of a lamp with three burners and a handle.\r\nThis was made by Sandell out of an old tea-pot and one, two or three\r\nburners could be lit as occasion demanded. During meal times the whole\r\nthree burners were used, but, as the oil smoked and smelt somewhat, we\r\ngenerally blew out two as soon as the meal was finished. This was the\r\n\"general\" lamp, but each man had, as well, one of his own invention.\r\nMine was scornfully referred to as the \"house-boat,\" since it consisted\r\nof a jam tin, which held the oil, standing in a herring tin which caught\r\nthe overflow.\r\n\r\nAt the end of June, Blake and I surveyed all the penguin rookeries round\r\nabout \"The Nuggets\" and, allowing a bird to the square foot, found that\r\nthere must have been about half a million birds in the area. The sealers\r\nkill birds from these rookeries to the number of about one hundred and\r\nthirty thousand yearly, so that it would seem reasonable to suppose\r\nthat, despite this fact, there must be an annual increase of about one\r\nhundred thousand birds.\r\n\r\nThe end of the month arrived and, on making inquiries, we found that\r\nthere was no news of the 'Rachel Cohen' having left Hobart. We had\r\nenough flour to last a fortnight, and could not get any from the sealers\r\nas they possessed only three weeks' supply themselves. However, on July\r\n8, Bauer came across and offered to let us have some wheatmeal biscuits\r\nas they had a couple of hundredweights, so I readily accepted twenty\r\npounds of them. We now had soup twice a day, and managed to make it\r\nfairly thick by adding sago and a few lentils. Cornflour and hot water\r\nflavoured with cocoa made a makeshift blanc-mange, and this, with sago\r\nand tapioca, constituted our efforts towards dessert.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th I received a message stating that the 'Rachel Cohen' had\r\nsailed on July 7; news which was joyfully received. We expected her to\r\nappear in ten or twelve days.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th we used the last ounce of flour in a small batch of bread,\r\nhaving fully expected the ship to arrive before we had finished it.\r\nNext day Bauer lent us ten pounds of oatmeal and showed us how to make\r\noatmeal cakes. We tried some and they were a complete success, though\r\nthey consisted largely of tapioca, and, according to the respective\r\namounts used, should rather have been called tapioca cakes.\r\n\r\nWhen the 22nd arrived and no ship showed up, I went across to see what\r\nthe sealers thought of the matter, and found that they all were of\r\nopinion that she had been blown away to the eastward of the island, and\r\nmight take a considerable time to \"make\" back.\r\n\r\nOn this date we came to the end of our meats, which I had been dealing\r\nout in a very sparing manner, just to provide a change from sea elephant\r\nand weka. We had now to subsist upon what we managed to catch. There\r\nwere still thirty-five tins of soup, of which only two tins a day\r\nwere used, so that there was sufficient for a few weeks. But we found\r\nourselves running short of some commodity each day, and after the 23rd\r\nreckoned to be without bread and biscuit.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture many heavy blows were experienced, and on the 24th a\r\nfifty-mile gale accompanied by a tremendous sea beat down on us, giving\r\nthe 'Rachel Cohen' a very poor chance of \"making\" the island. Our last\r\ntin of fruit was eaten; twelve tins having lasted us since March 31, and\r\nI also shared the remaining ten biscuits amongst the men on the 24th. We\r\nwere short of bread, flour, biscuits, meats, fish, jam, sugar and milk,\r\nbut had twenty tins of French beans, thirty tins of cornflour, some\r\ntapioca, and thirty tins of soup, as well as tea, coffee and cocoa in\r\nabundance. We had not been able to catch any fish for some days as the\r\nweather had been too rough, and, further, they appeared to leave the\r\ncoasts during the very cold weather.\r\n\r\nSea elephants were very scarce, and we invariably had to walk some\r\ndistance in order to get one; each man taking it in turn to go out with\r\na companion and carry home enough meat for our requirements. We were\r\nnow eating sea elephant meat three times a day (all the penguins having\r\nmigrated) and our appetites were very keen. The routine work was carried\r\non, though a great deal of time was occupied in getting food.\r\n\r\nBauer very generously offered to share his biscuits with us, but\r\nwe fellows, while appreciating the spirit which prompted the offer,\r\nunanimously declined to accept them. We now concluded that something\r\nhad happened to the ship, as at the end of July she had been twenty-four\r\ndays out.\r\n\r\nOn August 3 we had a sixty-three-mile gale and between 1 and 2 A.M. the\r\nvelocity of the wind frequently exceeded fifty miles per hour. Needless\r\nto say there was a mountainous sea running, and the Rachel Cohen, if she\r\nhad been anywhere in the vicinity, would have had a perilous time.\r\n\r\nA message came to me on August 6 from the Secretary of the Expedition,\r\nsaying that the 'Rachel Cohen' had returned to New Zealand badly\r\ndamaged, and that he was endeavouring to send us relief as soon as\r\npossible. I replied, telling him that our food-supply was done, but that\r\notherwise we were all right and no uneasiness need be felt, though we\r\nwished to be relieved as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSplendid news came along on the 9th to the effect that the New Zealand\r\nGovernment's steamer 'Tutanekai' would tranship our stores from the\r\n'Rachel Cohen' on the 15th and sail direct for the island.\r\n\r\nSawyer now became ill and desired me to make arrangements for his\r\nreturn. I accordingly wired to the Secretary, who replied asking if we\r\ncould manage without an operator. After consulting Sandell, I answered\r\nthat Sandell and I together could manage to run the wireless station.\r\n\r\nEverybody now looked forward eagerly to the arrival of the 'Tutanekai',\r\nbut things went on as before. We found ourselves with nothing but sea\r\nelephant meat and sago, with a pound-tin of French beans once a week and\r\ntwo ounces of oatmeal every morning.\r\n\r\nWe heard that the Tutanekai did not leave as expected on the 15th,\r\nbut sailed on the afternoon of the 17th, and was coming straight to\r\nMacquarie Island. She was equipped with a wireless telegraphy outfit,\r\nwhich enabled us on the 18th to get in touch with her; the operator on\r\nboard stating that they would reach us early on the morning of the 20th.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 19th we gave Sawyer a send-off dinner; surely the\r\npoorest thing of its kind, as far as eatables were concerned, that has\r\never been tendered to any one. The fare consisted of sea elephant's\r\ntongue \"straight,\" after which a bottle of claret was cracked and we\r\ndrank heartily to his future prosperity.\r\n\r\nAt 7.30 A.M. on the 20th the 'Tutanekai' was observed coming up the east\r\ncoast, and as we had \"elephanted\" at 6 A.M. we were ready to face the\r\nday. I went across to the sealers' hut and accompanied Bauer in the\r\nlaunch to the ship, which lay at anchor about a mile from the shore.\r\nWe scrambled on board, where I met Captain Bollons. He received me most\r\ncourteously, and, after discussing several matters, suggested landing\r\nthe stores straight away. I got into the launch to return to the shore,\r\nbut the wind had freshened and was soon blowing a fresh gale. Still,\r\nBauer thought we should have no difficulty and we pushed off from the\r\nship. The engine of the launch failed after we had gone a few yards, the\r\nboat was blown rapidly down the coast, and we were eventually thrown out\r\ninto the surf at \"The Nuggets.\" The Captain, who witnessed our plight,\r\nsent his launch in pursuit of us, but its engines also failed. It now\r\nbecame necessary for the crew of the whale-boat to go to the assistance\r\nof the launch. However, they could do nothing against the wind, and, in\r\nthe end, the ship herself got up anchor, gave the two boats a line\r\nand towed them back to the former anchorage. The work of unloading now\r\ncommenced, though a fairly heavy surf was running. But the whaleboat of\r\nthe 'Tutanekai' was so dexterously handled by the boatswain that most of\r\nour stores were landed during the day.\r\n\r\nSawyer went on board the 'Tutanekai' in the afternoon, thus severing his\r\nconnexion with the Expedition, after having been with us on the island\r\nsince December 1911. On the following morning, some sheep, coal and\r\nflour were landed, and, with a whistled good-bye, the 'Tutanekai'\r\nstarted north on her visit to other islands.\r\n\r\nOur short period of stress was over and we all felt glad. From that time\r\nonwards we ate no more elephant meat \"straight.\" A sheep was killed just\r\nas the 'Tutanekai' left, and we had roast mutton, scones, butter, jam,\r\nfruit and rice for tea. It was a rare treat.\r\n\r\nAll the stores were now brought up from the landing-place, and as I had\r\nput up several extra shelves some weeks previously, plenty of room was\r\nfound for all the perishable commodities inside the Shack.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of September found me fairly busy. In addition to the\r\nmeteorological work, the results of which were always kept reduced and\r\nentered up, I had to work on Wireless Hill during the evening and make\r\nauroral observations on any night during which there was a display,\r\nattending to the stores and taking the week of cooking as it came along.\r\n\r\nBlake and Hamilton went down the island for several days on September\r\n3, since they had some special observations to make in the vicinity of\r\nSandy Bay.\r\n\r\nThe sea elephant season was now in progress, and many rookeries were\r\nwell formed by the middle of the month. The skuas had returned, and on\r\nthe 19th the advance-guard of the Royal penguins arrived. The gentoos\r\nhad established themselves in their old \"claims,\" and since the 12th we\r\nhad been using their eggs for cooking.\r\n\r\nEarly in September time-signals were received from Melbourne, and these\r\nwere transmitted through to Adelie Land. This practice was kept up\r\nthroughout the month and in many cases the signals were acknowledged.\r\n\r\nBlake and Hamilton returned to the Shack on the 24th, but left again on\r\nthe 30th, as they had some more photographic work to do in the vicinity\r\nof Green Valley and Sandy Bay.\r\n\r\nBlake made a special trip to Sandy Bay on October 30 to bring back some\r\ngeological specimens and other things he had left there, but on\r\nreaching the spot found that the old hut had been burned to the ground,\r\napparently only a few hours before, since it was still smouldering. Many\r\narticles were destroyed, among which were two sleeping-bags, a sextant,\r\ngun, blankets, photographic plates, bird specimens and articles of\r\nclothing. It was presumed that rats had originated the fire from wax\r\nmatches which had been left lying on a small shelf.\r\n\r\nOn November 9 we heard that the 'Aurora' would leave Hobart on the 19th\r\nfor Antarctica, picking us up on the way and landing three men on the\r\nisland to continue the wireless and meteorological work.\r\n\r\nWe sighted the 'Rachel Cohen' bearing down on the island on November 18,\r\nand at 5.15 P.M. she came to an anchorage in North-East Bay. She brought\r\ndown the remainder of our coal and some salt for Hamilton for the\r\npreservation of specimens.\r\n\r\nOn the next night it was learned that the 'Aurora' had left Hobart on\r\nher way South, expecting to reach us about the 28th, as some sounding\r\nand dredging were being done en route.\r\n\r\nEverybody now became very busy making preparations for departure. Time\r\npassed very quickly, and November 28 dawned fine and bright. The 'Rachel\r\nCohen', which had been lying in the bay loading oil, had her full\r\ncomplement on board by 10 A.M., and shortly afterwards we trooped across\r\nto say good-bye to Bauer and the other sealers, who were all returning\r\nto Hobart. It was something of a coincidence that they took their\r\ndeparture on the very day our ship was to arrive. Their many acts of\r\nkindness towards us will ever be recalled by the members of the party,\r\nand we look upon our harmonious neighbourly association together with\r\nfeelings of great pleasure.\r\n\r\nA keen look-out was then kept for signs of our own ship, but it was not\r\nuntil 8 P.M. that Blake, who was up on the hill side, called out, \"Here\r\nshe comes,\" and we climbed up to take in the goodly sight. Just visible,\r\naway in the north-west, there was a line of thin smoke, and in about\r\nhalf an hour the 'Aurora' dropped anchor in Hasselborough Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII THE HOMEWARD CRUISE\r\n\r\n    We bring no store of ingots,\r\n    Of spice or precious stones;\r\n    But what we have we gathered\r\n    With sweat and aching bones.\r\n                          KIPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we sat in the wardroom of the 'Aurora' exchanging the news of months\r\nlong gone by, we heard from Captain Davis the story of his fair-weather\r\ntrip from Hobart. The ship had left Australian waters on November 19,\r\nand, from the outset, the weather was quite ideal. Nothing of note\r\noccurred on the run to Macquarie Island, where a party of three men were\r\nlanded and Ainsworth and his loyal comrades picked up. The former\r\nparty, sent by the Australian Government, were to maintain wireless\r\ncommunication with Hobart and to send meteorological reports to the\r\nCommonwealth Weather Bureau. A week was spent at the island and all the\r\ncollections were embarked, while Correll was enabled to secure some\r\ngood colour photographs and Hurley to make valuable additions to his\r\ncinematograph film.\r\n\r\nThe 'Aurora' had passed through the \"fifties\" without meeting the usual\r\ngales, sighting the first ice in latitude 63 degrees 33' S., longitude\r\n150 degrees 29' E. She stopped to take a sounding every twenty-four\r\nhours, adding to the large number already accumulated during her cruises\r\nover the vast basin of the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nAll spoke of the clear and beautiful days amid the floating ice and of\r\nthe wonderful coloured sunsets; especially the photographers. The\r\npack was so loosely disposed, that the ship made a straight course for\r\nCommonwealth Bay, steaming up to Cape Denison on the morning of December\r\n14 to find us all eager to renew our claim on the big world up North.\r\n\r\nThere was a twenty-five-knot wind and a small sea when we pulled off in\r\nthe whale-boat to the ship, but, as if conspiring to give us for once a\r\ngala-day, the wind fell off, the bay became blue and placid and the sun\r\nbeat down in full thawing strength on the boundless ice and snow. The\r\nAdelians, if that may be used as a distinctive title, sat on the warm\r\ndeck and read letters and papers in voracious haste, with snatches of\r\nthe latest intelligence from the Macquarie Islanders and the ship's\r\nofficers. No one could erase that day from the tablets of his memory.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the motor-launch went ashore, and the first of the\r\ncargo was sent off. The weather remained serene and calm, and for the\r\nnext six days, with the exception of a \"sixty-miler\" for a few hours and\r\na land breeze overnight, there was nothing to disturb the embarkation of\r\nour bulky impedimenta which almost filled the outer Hut. Other work\r\nwent on apace. The skua gulls, snow and Wilson petrels were laying their\r\neggs, and Hamilton went ashore to secure specimens and to add to our\r\nalready considerable collection of bird skins. Hunter had a fish-trap\r\nlowered from the forecastle, used a hand dredge from the ship, and did\r\ntow-netting occasionally from the launch in its journeys to and from the\r\nland. Hurley and Correll had bright sunshine to ensure good photographic\r\nresults. Bage and Hodgeman looked after the transport of stores from the\r\nHut, and Gillies, Bickerton and Madigan ran the motor-launch. McLean,\r\nwho was now in possession of an incubator and culture tubes, grew\r\nbacteria from various sources--seals and birds, soils, ice and snow.\r\nAinsworth, Blake and Sandell, making their first acquaintance with\r\nAdelie Land, were most often to be seen quarrying ice on the glacier or\r\npulling loaded sledges down to the harbour.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nMackellar Islets\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th a party of us went off to the Mackellar Islets in the\r\nmotor-launch, taking a tent and provisions, intending to spend two days\r\nthere surveying and making scientific observations.\r\n\r\nThese islets, over thirty in number, are clustered mainly in a group\r\nabout two miles off shore. The group is encircled by rocky \"outposts,\"\r\nand there are several \"links\" to the southern mainland. Under a\r\nbrilliant sun, across the pale blue water, heaving in a slow northerly\r\nswell, the motor-launch threaded her way between the granite knobs,\r\ncapped with solid spray. The waves had undermined the white canopies\r\nso that they stood immobile, perched on the dark, kelp-fringed rocks,\r\ncasting their pallid reflections in the turquoise sea. Steaming into a\r\nnatural harbour, bordered by a low ice-foot on which scores of Weddell\r\nseals lay in listless slumber, we landed on the largest islet--a\r\nsuccession of salt-encrusted ridges covered by straggling penguin\r\nrookeries. The place just teemed with the sporadic life of an Antarctic\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nIt was calculated that the Adelie penguins exceeded one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand in number over an area of approximately one hundred\r\nacres. Near the landing-place there were at least sixty seals and snow\r\npetrels; skua gulls and Wilson petrels soon betrayed their nests to the\r\nbiologists.\r\n\r\nThe islets are flat, and afford evidence that at one time the\r\ncontinental ice-cap has ridden over them. The rock is a hard grey\r\ngneiss. A rough plane-table map of the group was made by Hodgeman and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nOur scheme of local exploration was now continued to the west. For two\r\nyears we had looked curiously at a patch of rocks protruding beneath\r\nthe ice-cap eight miles away, within Commonwealth Bay. It had been\r\ninaccessible to sledging parties, and so we reserved Cape Hunter, as it\r\nwas ultimately called, for the coming of the Ship.\r\n\r\nThe anchor was raised on the forenoon of the 22nd, and by midday the\r\n'Aurora' steamed at half-speed along the ramparts of the glacier,\r\nstopping about four miles from the Cape, after sounding in four hundred\r\nand twenty-four fathoms. Through field-glasses much had already been\r\nseen; enough to arouse an intense interest.\r\n\r\nOne could not but respond to the idea that here was a new world,\r\nflawless and unblemished, into which no human being had ever pried. Here\r\nwere open secrets to be read for the first time. It was not with the\r\ncold eye of science alone that we gazed at these rocks--a tiny spur of\r\nthe great unseen continent; but it was with an indefinable wonder.\r\n\r\nIn perfect weather a small party set off in the launch towards a large\r\ngrounded berg which appeared to lie under the ice-cliffs. Approaching it\r\nclosely, after covering two miles, we could see that it was still more\r\nthan a mile to the rocks.\r\n\r\nPenguins soon began to splash around; Wilson petrels came glancing\r\noverhead and we could descry great flocks of Antarctic petrels wheeling\r\nover cliff and sea. Reefs buried in frothing surge showed their\r\nglistening mantles, and the boat swerved to avoid floating streamers of\r\nbrash-ice.\r\n\r\nThe rocky cliffs, about eighty feet in height at the highest point,\r\nwere formed of vertically lying slate rocks--a very uniform series of\r\nphyllite and sericite-schist. At their base lay great clinging blocks\r\nof ice deeply excavated by the restless swell. One island was separated\r\nfrom the parent mass by a channel cut sheer to the deep blue water.\r\nBehind the main rocks and indenting the ice-cliff was a curving bay into\r\nwhich we steered, finding at its head a beautiful cove fringed with a\r\nheavy undermined ice-foot and swarming with Adelie penguins. Overhanging\r\nthe water was a cavern hollowed out of a bridge of ice thrown from the\r\nglacier to the western limit of the rock outcrop.\r\n\r\nHurley had before him a picture in perfect proportion. The steel-blue\r\nwater, paled by an icy reflection, a margin of brown rocks on which the\r\npenguins leapt through the splashing surf, a curving canopy of ice-foot\r\nand, filling the background, the cavern with pendent icicles along its\r\ncornice.\r\n\r\nThe swell was so great that an anchor had to be thrown from the stern to\r\nkeep the launch off shore, and two men remained on board to see that no\r\ndamage was done.\r\n\r\nAt last we were free to roam and explore. Over the first ridge of rocks\r\nwe walked suddenly into the home of the Antarctic petrels! There had\r\nalways been much speculation as to where these birds nested. Jones'\r\nparty at our western base had the previous summer at Haswell Island\r\nhappened upon the first rookery of Antarctic petrels ever discovered.\r\nHere was another spot in the great wilderness peopled by their\r\nthousands. Every available nook and crevice was occupied along a wide\r\nslope which shelved away until it met the vertical cliffs falling to the\r\nocean. One could sit down among the soft, mild birds who were fearless\r\nat the approach of man. They rested in pairs close to their eggs laid on\r\nthe bare rock or among fragments of slate loosely arranged to resemble a\r\nrest. Many eggs were collected, and the birds, losing confidence in us,\r\nrose into the air in flocks, gaining in feathered volume as they circled\r\nin fear above this domain of rock and snow which had been theirs for\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nIn adjoining rookeries the Adelie penguins, with their fat, downy\r\ncheeks, were very plentiful and fiercer than usual. Skuas, snow and\r\nWilson petrels were all in their accustomed haunts. Down on the low\r\nice-foot at the mouth of a rocky ravine, a few seals had effected\r\na landing. Algae, mosses and lichens made quite a display in moist\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving for the ship, we \"boiled the billy\" on a platform of\r\nslate near the cove where the launch was anchored and had a small\r\npicnic, entertained by the penguins playing about in the surf or scaling\r\nthe ice-foot to join the birds which were laboriously climbing to the\r\nrookeries on the ridge. The afternoon was so peaceful and the calm\r\nhot weather such a novelty to us that we pushed off reluctantly to the\r\n'Aurora' after an eventful day.\r\n\r\nThose on board had had a busy time dredging, and their results were just\r\nas successful as ours. A haul was made in two hundred and fifty fathoms\r\nof ascidians, sponges, crinoids, holothurians, fish and other forms of\r\nlife in such quantity that Hunter and Hamilton were occupied in sorting\r\nthe specimens until five o'clock next morning. Meanwhile the 'Aurora'\r\nhad returned to her old anchorage close to Cape Denison.\r\n\r\nThe sky banked up from the south with nimbus, and early on the 23rd a\r\nstrong breeze ruffled the water. There were a few things to be brought\r\noff from the shore, while Ainsworth, Sandell and Correll were still\r\nat the Hut, so that, as the weather conditions pointed to a coming\r\nblizzard, I decided to \"cut the painter\" with the land.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the motor-launch, with Madigan and Bickerton, sped away\r\nfor the last load through falling snow and a rising sea. Hodgeman had\r\nbattened down the windows of the Hut, the chimney was stuffed with\r\nbagging, the veranda-entrance closed with boards, and, inside, an\r\ninvitation was left for future visitors to occupy and make themselves\r\nat home. After the remainder of the dogs and some miscellaneous gear had\r\nbeen shipped, the launch put off and came alongside in a squally wind\r\nthrough thick showers of snow. Willing hands soon unloaded the boat\r\nand slung it in the davits. Every one was at last safe on board, and in\r\nfuture all our operations were to be conducted from the ship.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the wind rose and the barometer fell, while the air was\r\nfilled with drifting snow. On the 24th--Christmas Eve--the velocity of\r\nthe wind gradually increased to the seventies until at noon it blew with\r\nthe strength of a hurricane. Chief Officer Blair, stationed with a few\r\nmen under the fo'c'sle-head, kept an anxious eye on the anchor chain and\r\nwindlass.\r\n\r\nAbout lunch time the anchor was found to be dragging and we commenced to\r\ndrift before the hurricane. All view of the land and lurking dangers in\r\nthe form of reefs and islets were cut off by driving snow.\r\n\r\nThe wind twanged the rigging to a burring drone that rose to a shriek in\r\nthe shuddering gusts. The crests of the waves were cut off and sprayed\r\nin fine spindrift. With full steam on we felt our way out, we hoped to\r\nthe open sea; meanwhile the chain cable and damaged anchor were slowly\r\nbeing hauled in. The ship's chances looked very small indeed, but, owing\r\nto the good seamanship of Captain Davis and a certain amount of luck,\r\ndisaster was averted. Soon we were in a bounding sea. Each time we were\r\nlifted on a huge roller the motor-launch, swinging in the davits, would\r\nrise and then descend with a crash on the water, to be violently bumped\r\nagainst the bulwarks. Everything possible was done to save the launch,\r\nbut our efforts proved fruitless. As it was being converted into a\r\nbattering ram against the ship itself it had to be cut away, and was\r\nsoon swept astern and we saw no more of it.\r\n\r\nMost unexpectedly there came a lull in the wind, so that it was almost\r\ncalm, though the ship still laboured in the seas. A clearance in the\r\natmosphere was also noticeable for Cape Hunter became discernible to the\r\nwest, towards which we were rapidly drifting. This sight of the coast\r\nwas a great satisfaction to us, for we then knew our approximate\r\nposition ** and the direction of the wind, which had veered\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ** It should be borne in mind that compasses are unreliable in the\r\nvicinity of the magnetic pole.\r\n\r\nThe lull lasted scarcely five minutes when the wind came back from a\r\nsomewhat different quarter, north of east, as violent as ever. The\r\n\"eye\" of the storm had passed over us, and the gale continued steady for\r\nseveral days. That night the struggle with the elements was kept up by\r\nofficers and crew, assisted by members of the shore party who took the\r\nlee-wheel or stood by in case of emergency.\r\n\r\n\"December 25. Christmas Day on the high seas off Adelie Land, everything\r\nwet and fairly miserable; incipient mal de mer, wind 55-60; snowing!\r\nWhen Davis came down to breakfast and wished us a Merry Christmas, with\r\na smile at the irony of it, the ward-room was swaying about in a most\r\nbewildering fashion.\"\r\n\r\nTowards evening, after the 'Aurora' had battled for hours slowly to the\r\neast, the sea went down somewhat and some drifting ice was sighted. We\r\ncontinued under full steam, pushing forward to gain the shelter of the\r\nMertz glacier-tongue. It was now discovered that the fluke of the anchor\r\nhad broken off short, so great had been the strain imposed upon it\r\nduring the height of the hurricane.\r\n\r\nOn Boxing Day the ship was in calmer water heading in a more southerly\r\ndirection so as to come up with the land. Fog, fine snow and an\r\novercast sky made a gloomy combination, but during the afternoon the fog\r\nlightened sufficiently for us to perceive the mainland--a ghostly cliff\r\nshrouded in diaphanous blink. By 10 P.M. the Mertz glacier was visible\r\non the port bow, and to starboard there was an enormous tilted berg\r\nwhich appeared to be magnified in the dim light.\r\n\r\nAllowing a day for the weather to become clearer and more settled,\r\nwe got out the trawl on the 28th and did a dredging in three hundred\r\nfathoms close to the glacier-tongue. Besides rocks and mud there were\r\nabundant crinoids, holothurians, corals, crustaceans and \"shells.\"\r\nIn addition, several pieces of fossilized wood and coaly matter were\r\ndiscovered scattered through the \"catch.\"\r\n\r\nBage, under Davis's direction, took temperatures and collected water\r\nsamples at fifty, seventy-five, one hundred, two hundred and three\r\nhundred fathoms, using the Lucas sounding-machine on the fo'c'sle. The\r\ntemperature gradient from the surface downwards appeared to give some\r\nindication of the depth of ice submerged in the glacier-tongue alongside\r\nwhich we were lying.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th a cold south-easter blew off the ice-cliffs and the sun was\r\ntrying to pierce a gauzy alto-stratus. The 'Aurora' steamed north-east,\r\nit being our intention to round the northern limit of the Mertz Glacier.\r\nGradually a distant line of pack, which had been visible for some time,\r\nclosed in and the ship ran into a cul-de-sac. Gray, who was up in the\r\ncrow's-nest, reported that the ice was very heavy, so we put about.\r\n\r\nProceeding southward once more, we glided along within a stone's throw\r\nof the great wall of ice whose chiselled headlands stood in profile\r\nfor miles. There was leisure to observe various features of this great\r\nformation, and to make some valuable photographic records when the low\r\nsouth-western sun emerged into a wide rift. Hunter trailed the tow-net\r\nfor surface plankton while the ship was going at half-speed.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock the ship had come up with the land, and her course was\r\nturned sharply to the north-west towards a flotilla of bergs lying to\r\nthe east of the Way Archipelago, which we intended to visit.\r\n\r\nOn December 30, 1913, the 'Aurora' lay within a cordon of floating ice\r\nabout one mile distant from the nearest islet of a group scattered along\r\nthe coast off Cape Gray.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast a party of eight men set off in the launch\r\nto investigate Stillwell Island. The weather was gloriously sunny and\r\nevery one was eager at the prospect of fresh discoveries. Cape Hunter\r\nhad been the home of the Antarctic petrels, and on this occasion we\r\nwere singularly fortunate in finding a resort of the Southern Fulmar\r\nor silver-grey petrels. During the previous summer, two of the eastern\r\nsledging parties had for the first time observed the breeding habits of\r\nthese birds among isolated rocks outcropping on the edge of the coast.\r\nBut here there was a stronghold of hundreds of petrels, sitting with\r\ntheir eggs in niches among the boulders or ensconced in bowers excavated\r\nbeneath the snow which lay deep over some parts of the island.\r\n\r\nThe rock was a gneiss which varied in character from that which had been\r\nexamined at Cape Denison and in other localities. All the scientific\r\ntreasures were exhausted by midday, and the whale-boat was well laden\r\nwhen we rowed back to the ship.\r\n\r\nThroughout a warm summer afternoon the 'Aurora' threaded her way between\r\nmajestic bergs and steamed west across the wide span of Commonwealth\r\nBay, some fifteen miles off the land. At eleven o'clock the sky was\r\nperfectly clear and the sun hung like a luminous ball over the southern\r\nplateau. The rocks near the Hut were just visible. Close to the\r\n\"Pianoforte Berg\" and the Mackellar Islets tall jets of fine spray were\r\nseen to shoot upward from schools of finner whales. All around us and\r\nfor miles shoreward, the ocean was calm and blue; but close to the\r\nmainland there was a dark curving line of ruffled water, while through\r\nglasses one could see trails of serpentine drift flowing down the slopes\r\nof the glacier. Doubtless, it was blowing at the Hut; and the thought\r\nwas enough to make us thankful that we were on our good ship leaving\r\nAdelie Land for ever.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 31, 1913, Cape Alden was abeam, and a strong\r\nwind swept down from the highlands. Bordering the coast there was a\r\nlinear group of islets and outcropping rocks at which we had hoped to\r\ntouch. The wind continued to blow so hard that the idea was abandoned\r\nand our course was directed towards the north-west to clear a submerged\r\nreef which had been discovered in January 1912.\r\n\r\nThe wind and sea arose during the night, causing the ship to roll in a\r\nreckless fashion. Yet the celebration of New Year's Eve was not marred,\r\nand lusty choruses came up from the ward-room till long after midnight.\r\nNext morning at breakfast our ranks had noticeably thinned through the\r\nliveliness of the ship, but it is wonderful how large an assembly we\r\nmustered for the New Year's dinner, and how cheerfully the toast was\r\ndrunk to \"The best year we have ever had!\"\r\n\r\nOn January 2, 1914, fast ice and the mainland were sighted. The course\r\nwas changed to the south-west so as to bring the ship within a girdle\r\nof loose ice disposed in big solid chunks and small pinnacled floes.\r\nA sounding realized two hundred fathoms some ten miles off the coast,\r\nwhich stretched like a lofty bank of yellow sand along the southern\r\nhorizon. On previous occasions we had not been able to see so much of\r\nthe coastline in this longitude owing to the compactness of the ice, and\r\nso we were able to definitely chart a longer tract at the western limit\r\nof Adelie Land.\r\n\r\nThe ice became so thick and heavy as the 'Aurora' pressed southward that\r\nshe was forced at last to put about and steer for more open water. On\r\nthe way, a sounding was made in two hundred and fifty fathoms, but a\r\ndredging was unsuccessful owing to the fact that insufficient cable was\r\npaid out in going from two hundred and fifty fathoms to deeper water.\r\n\r\nOur north-westerly course ran among a great number of very long tabular\r\nbergs, which suggested the possibility of a neighbouring glacier-tongue\r\nas their origin.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock on the evening of the 2nd, a mountain of ice with a high\r\nencircling bastion passed to starboard. It rose to a peak, flanked by\r\nfragments toppling in snowy ruin. The pyramidal summit was tinged the\r\npalest lilac in the waning light; the mighty pallid walls were streaked\r\nand blotched with deep azure; the green swell sucked and thundered in\r\nthe wave-worn caverns. Chaste snow-birds swam through the pure air, and\r\nthe whole scene was sacred.\r\n\r\nA tropical day in the pack-ice! Sunday January 4 was clear and perfectly\r\nstill, and the sun shone powerfully. On the previous day we had entered\r\na wide field of ice which had become so close and heavy that the ship\r\ntook till late in the evening to reach its northern fringe.\r\n\r\nFrom January 5 onwards for two weeks we steamed steadily towards the\r\nwest, repeatedly changing course to double great sheets of pack which\r\nstreamed away to the north, pushing through them in other places where\r\nthe welcome \"water-sky showed strong\" ahead, making \"southing\" for days\r\nfollowing the trend of the ice, then grappling with it in the hope of\r\nwinning through to the land and at last returning to the western track\r\nalong the margin of brash which breaks the first swell of the Southern\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nThe weather was mostly overcast with random showers of light snow and\r\nmild variable winds on all but two days, when there was a \"blow\" of\r\nforty miles per hour and a considerable sea in which the ship seemed\r\nmore active than usual.\r\n\r\nMany soundings were taken, and their value lay in broadly [...] Of\r\ncourse, too, we were supplementing the ship's previous work in these\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\n[TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\nSection Illustrating The Moat In The Antarctic Continental Shelf\r\n\r\n\r\nOne successful dredging in eighteen hundred fathoms brought up some\r\nlarge erratics and coaly matter, besides a great variety of animal life.\r\nIt was instructive to find that the erratics were coated with a film of\r\nmanganese oxide derived from the sea-water. Several tow-nettings were\r\ntaken with large nets automatically closing at any desired depth through\r\nthe medium of a \"messenger.\" Small crustaceans were plentiful on the\r\nsurface, but they were if anything more numerous at depths of fifty\r\nto one hundred fathoms. Amongst the latter were some strongly\r\nphosphorescent forms. The flying birds were \"logged\" daily by the\r\nbiologists. Emperor and Adelie penguins were occasionally seen, among\r\nthe floes as well as sea-leopards, crab-eater and Weddell seals.\r\n\r\nFriday January 16 deserves mention as being a day full of incident. In\r\nthe morning a thin, cold fog hung along the pack whose edge determined\r\nour course. Many petrels flew around, and on the brash-ice there were\r\ndark swarms of terns--small birds with black-capped heads, dove-grey\r\nbacks and silvery-white breasts. They were very nervous of the ship,\r\nrising in great numbers when it had approached within a few hundred\r\nyards. One startled bird would fly up, followed by several more; then\r\na whole covey would disturb the rest of the flock. Hamilton managed to\r\nshoot two of them from the fo'c'sle, and, after much manoeuvring, we\r\nsecured one with a long hand-net.\r\n\r\nSoon after, there was a cry of \"killer whales!\" from the stern. Schools\r\nof them were travelling from the west to the east along the edge of the\r\npack. The water was calm and leaden, and every few seconds a big\r\nblack triangular fin would project from the surface, there would be\r\na momentary glimpse of a dark yellow-blotched back and then all would\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nWe pushed into the pack to \"ice ship,\" as the water-supply was running\r\nlow. Just as the 'Aurora' was leaving the open water, a school of finner\r\nwhales went by, blowing high jets of spray in sudden blasts, wallowing\r\nfor a few seconds on the surface, and diving in swirls of foam. These\r\nfinners or rorquals are enormous mammals, and on one occasion we were\r\nfollowed by one for several hours. It swam along with the ship, diving\r\nregularly underneath from one side to another, and we wondered what\r\nwould happen if it had chosen to charge the vessel or to investigate the\r\npropeller.\r\n\r\nClose to a big floe to which the ship was secured, two crab-eater\r\nseals were shot and hauled aboard to be skinned and investigated by the\r\nbiologists and bacteriologist. When the scientists had finished their\r\nwork, the meat and blubber were cut up for the dogs, while the choicer\r\nsteaks were taken to the cook's galley.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch every one started to \"ice ship\" in earnest. The sky had\r\ncleared and the sun was warm and brilliant by the time a party had\r\nlanded on the snow-covered floe with baskets, picks and shovels. When\r\nthe baskets had been filled, they were hoisted by hand-power on to a\r\nderrick which had been fixed to the mizen mast, swung inboard and then\r\nshovelled into a melting tank alongside the engine-room. The melter was\r\na small tank through which ran a coil of steam pipes. The ice came up in\r\nsuch quantity that it was not melted in time to keep up with the demand,\r\nso a large heap was made on the deck.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon it was found that holes chipped in the sea-ice to\r\na depth of six or eight inches filled quickly with fresh water, and soon\r\na gang of men had started a service with buckets and dippers between\r\nthese pools and the main hatch where the water was poured through\r\nfunnels into the ship's tanks. The bulwarks on the port side of the\r\nmain hatch had been taken down, and a long plank stretched across to\r\nthe floe. At nine o'clock work was stopped and we once more resumed our\r\nwestern cruise.\r\n\r\nIt was found that as the region of Queen Mary Land approached, heavy\r\npack extended to the north. While skirting this obstacle, we disclosed\r\nby soundings a steep rise in the ocean's floor from a depth of about\r\nfifteen hundred fathoms to within seven hundred fathoms of the surface,\r\nsouth of which there was deep water. It was named \"Bruce Rise\" in\r\nrecognition of the oceanographical work of the Scottish Expedition in\r\nAntarctic seas.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, in latitude 62 degrees 21' S., longitude 95 degrees 9' E.,\r\nthe course ran due south for more than seven hours. For the two ensuing\r\ndays the ship was able to steer approximately south-west through\r\nslackening ice, until on the 19th at midday we were in latitude 64\r\ndegrees 59' S., longitude 90 degrees 8' E. At length it appeared that\r\nland was approaching, after a westward run of more than twelve hundred\r\nmiles. Attempts to reach the charted position of Totten's Land, North's\r\nLand, Budd Land and Knox Land had been successively abandoned when it\r\nbecame evident that the pack occupied a more northerly situation than\r\nthat of the two previous years, and was in most instances thick and\r\nimpenetrable.\r\n\r\nAt 10 P.M. on the 19th, the ice fields still remaining loose and\r\nnavigable, a dark line of open water was observed ahead. From the\r\ncrow's-nest it was seen to the south stretching east and west within\r\nthe belt of pack-ice--the Davis Sea. We had broken through the pack less\r\nthan twenty-five miles north of where the 'Gauss' (German Expedition,\r\n1902) had wintered.\r\n\r\nAll next day the 'Aurora' steamed into the eye of an easterly wind\r\ntowards a low white island, the higher positions of which had been seen\r\nby the German Expedition of 1902, and charted as Drygalski's High Land.\r\nDr. Jones' party had, the year before, obtained a distant view of it\r\nand regarded it as an island, which proved to be correct, so we named\r\nit Drygalski Island. To the south there was the dim outline of the\r\nmainland. Soundings varied between two hundred and three hundred\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, Drygalski Island was close at hand, and a series of\r\nsoundings which showed from sixty to seventy fathoms of water deepening\r\ntowards the mainland proved beyond doubt that it was an island. In shape\r\nit is like a flattened dome about nine miles in diameter and twelve\r\nhundred feet in height, bounded by perpendicular cliffs of ice, and with\r\nno visible evidence of outcropping rock.\r\n\r\nThe dredge was lowered in sixty fathoms, and a rich assortment of life\r\nwas captured for the biologists--Hunter and Hamilton. A course was then\r\nmade to the south amidst a sea of great bergs; the water deepening to\r\nabout four hundred fathoms.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening the crevassed slopes of the mainland rose clear to\r\nthe south, and many islets were observed near the coast, frozen in a\r\nwide expanse of bay-ice. Haswell Island, visited by Jones, Dovers and\r\nHoadley of the Western Party, was sighted, and the ship was able to\r\napproach within eight miles of it; at ten o'clock coming up to flat\r\nbay-ice, where she anchored for the night. Before we retired to bunk, a\r\nRoss seal was discovered and shot, three-quarters of a mile away.\r\n\r\nNext day, January 22, an unexpected find was made of five more of this\r\nrare species of seal. Many Emperor penguins were also secured. It would\r\nhave been interesting to visit the great rookery of Emperor penguins\r\non Haswell Island, but, as the ship could only approach to within eight\r\nmiles of it, I did not think it advisable to allow a party to go so far.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 22nd, the 'Aurora' was headed northeast for the\r\nShackleton Ice-Shelf. In the early hours of the 28rd a strong gale\r\nsprang up and rapidly increased in violence. A pall of nimbus overspread\r\nthe sky, and blinding snow commenced to fall.\r\n\r\nWe had become used to blizzards, but on this occasion several factors\r\nmade us somewhat apprehensive. The ship was at least twenty-five miles\r\nfrom shelter on an open sea, littered with bergs and fragments of ice.\r\nThe wind was very strong; the maximum velocity exceeding seventy miles\r\nper hour, and the dense driving snow during the midnight hours of\r\nsemi-darkness reduced our chances of navigating with any certainty.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 23rd had a touch of terror. The wind was so powerful\r\nthat, with a full head of steam and steering a few points off the eye of\r\nthe wind, the ship could just hold her own. But when heavy gusts swooped\r\ndown and the propeller raced on the crest of a mountainous wave, Davis\r\nfound it impossible to keep steerage-way.\r\n\r\nDrift and spray lash the faces of officer and helmsman, and through the\r\ngrey gloom misty bergs glide by on either hand. A long slow struggle\r\nbrings us to a passage between two huge masses of ice. There is a shock\r\nas the vessel bumps and grinds along a great wall. The engine stops,\r\nstarts again, and stops once more. The yards on the foremast are swung\r\ninto the wind, the giant seas are broken by the stolid barriers of ice,\r\nthe engine commences to throb with its old rhythm, and the ship\r\nslowly creeps out to meet the next peril. It comes with the onset of\r\na \"bergy-bit\" which smashes the martingale as it plunges into a deep\r\ntrough. The chain stay parts, dragging loose in the water, while a great\r\nstrain is put by the foremast on the bowsprit.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 24th the ship was put about and ran with the wind, while\r\nall hands assembled on the fo'c'sle. The crew, under the direction of\r\nBlair, had the ticklish job of replacing the chain stay by two heavy\r\nblocks, the lower of which was hooked on to the lug which secured\r\nthe end of the stay, and the upper to the bowsprit. The running ropes\r\nconnecting the blocks were tightened up by winding the hauling line\r\nround the capstan. When the boatswain and two sailors had finished the\r\nwet and chilly task of getting the tackle into position, the rest put\r\ntheir weight on to the capstan bars and the strain on the bowsprit was\r\nrelieved. The fo'c'sle, plunging and swaying in the great waves,\r\nwas encased in frozen spray, and along all the ropes and stays were\r\ncontinuous cylinders of ice. The 'Aurora' then resumed her easterly\r\ncourse against the blizzard.\r\n\r\nSaturday January 24 was a day of high wind, rough seas, watery decks,\r\nlively meals and general discomfort. At 11.30 P.M. the waves had\r\nperceptibly decreased, and it was surmised that we were approaching\r\nthe berg, about thirty miles in length, which lay to the west of the\r\nShackleton Ice-Shelf.\r\n\r\nAt 6 A.M. on the 25th the sun managed to glimmer through the low rack\r\nflying from the east, lighting up the carven face of an ice-cliff\r\nalong which the 'Aurora' was coasting. Up and down we steamed until the\r\nafternoon of the 26th, when the wind lulled away to nothing, and the\r\ngrey, even pall of cloud rose and broke into fleecy alto-cumulus.\r\n\r\nAt the southern extremity of the long berg, fast bay-ice extended up to\r\nthe land and for twenty miles across to the shelf on which the Winter\r\nQuarters of the Western Party had been situated. Further progress to\r\nthe south was blocked, so our course was directed to the north along the\r\nwestern border of the berg.\r\n\r\nWhen not engaged in sounding, dredging, or tow-netting members of the\r\nland party found endless diversion in trimming coal. Big inroads had\r\nbeen made in the supply of more than five hundred tons, and it now\r\nbecame necessary to shift many tons of it from the holds aft to the\r\nbunkers where it was accessible to the firemen. The work was good\r\nexercise, and every one enjoyed the shift below, \"trucking\"and\r\n\"heaving.\" Another undoubted advantage, in the opinion of each worker,\r\nwas that he could at least demand a wash from Chief Engineer Gillies,\r\nwho at other times was forced to be thrifty with hot fresh water.\r\n\r\nAfter supper on the 28th it was evident that we had reached a point\r\nwhere the shelf-ice veered away to the eastward and a wide tract of\r\nadhering sea-ice barred the way. The floe was exceedingly heavy and\r\ncovered with a deep layer of soft snow. Emperor and Adelie penguins,\r\ncrab-eater and Weddell seals were recognized through glasses along its\r\nedge. As there was a light obscuring fog and dusk was approaching, the\r\n'Aurora' \"hung up\" for the night.\r\n\r\nOn January 29 the ship, after a preliminary trawling had been done in\r\nthree hundred and twenty fathoms, pushed into the floe and was made\r\nfast with an ice-anchor. Emperor penguins were so plentiful in the\r\nneighbourhood that many specimens were secured for skins.\r\n\r\nA sea-leopard was seen chasing a crab-eater seal quite close to the bow\r\nof the ship. The latter, after several narrow escapes, took refuge on an\r\nice-foot projecting from the edge of the floe.\r\n\r\nAdvantage was taken of a clearing in the weather to walk over the\r\nsea-ice to a berg two and a half miles away, from the summit of which\r\nit was hoped that some sign of land might be apparent. Away in the\r\ndistance, perhaps five miles further on, could be seen an immense\r\ncongregation of Emperor Penguins--evidently another rookery. No certain\r\nland was visible.\r\n\r\nThe cruise was now continued to the north-west in order to skirt a\r\ncollection of bergs and floe, with the ultimate object of proceeding\r\nin an easterly direction towards Termination Ice-Tongue at the northern\r\nlimit of the Shackleton Shelf-Ice.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map which illustrates the work done by the Western Party\r\naffords the best idea of the great ice-formation which stretches away\r\nto the north of Queen Mary Land. It is very similar in character to the\r\nwell-known Ross Barrier over which lay part of Scott's and Amundsen's\r\njourneys to the South Pole. Its height is remarkably uniform, ranging\r\nfrom sixty to one hundred feet above the water-level. When allowance\r\nhas been made for average specific gravity, its average total thickness\r\nshould approximate to six hundred feet. From east to west the formation\r\nwas proved to be as much as two hundred miles, with one hundred and\r\neighty miles between its northern and southern limits.\r\n\r\nThis vast block of ice originates fundamentally from the glacial\r\nflow over the southern hinterland. Every year an additional layer of\r\nconsolidated snow is added to its surface by the frequent blizzards.\r\nThese annual additions are clearly marked in the section exposed on the\r\ndazzling white face near the brink of the ice-cliff. There is a limit,\r\nhowever, to the increase in thickness, for the whole mass is ever moving\r\nslowly to the north, driven by the irresistible pressure of the land-ice\r\nbehind it. Thus the northern face crumbles down into brash or floats\r\naway as part of a berg severed from the main body of the shelf-ice.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of January 30 we had the unique experience of witnessing\r\nthis crumbling action at work--a cataclysm of snow, ice and water! The\r\nship was steaming along within three hundred yards of a cliff, when some\r\nloose drifts slid off from its edge, followed by a slice of the face\r\nextending for many hundreds of feet and weighing perhaps one million\r\ntons. It plunged into the sea with a deep booming roar and then rose\r\nmajestically, shedding great masses of snow, to roll onwards exposing\r\nits blue, swaying bulk shivering into lumpy masses which pushed towards\r\nthe ship in an ever-widening field of ice. It was a grand scene enacted\r\nin the subdued limelight of an overcast day.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon the 'Aurora' changed her north-westerly course\r\nround to north-east, winding through a wonderful sea of bergs grounded\r\nin about one hundred and twenty fathoms of water. At times we would pass\r\nthrough narrow lanes between towering walls and emerge into a straight\r\nwide avenue along which these mountains of ice were ranged. Several were\r\nrather remarkable; one for its exquisite series of stratification\r\nlines, another for its facade in stucco, and a third for its overhanging\r\ncornice fringed with slender icicles.\r\n\r\nOn January 31 a trawling was made in one hundred and twelve fathoms.\r\nHalf a ton of life emptied on the deck gave the biologists occupation\r\nfor several days. Included in the catch were a large number of monstrous\r\ngelatinous ascidians or \"sea-squirts.\" Fragments of coal were once more\r\nfound; an indication that coaly strata must be very widely distributed\r\nin the Antarctic.\r\n\r\nThe pack was dense and in massive array at the extremity of Termination\r\nIce-Tongue. Davis drove the ship through some of it and entered an open\r\nlead which ran like a dark streak away to the east amid ice which grew\r\nheavier and more marked by the stress of pressure.\r\n\r\nOur time was now limited and it seemed to me that there was little\r\nchance of reaching open water by forcing a passage either to the east or\r\nnorth. We therefore turned on our tracks and broke south-west back into\r\nthe Davis Sea, intending to steam westward to the spot where we had so\r\neasily entered two weeks previously.\r\n\r\nOn February 4 the pack to the north was beginning to thin out and to\r\nlook navigable. Several short-cuts were taken across projecting \"capes,\"\r\nand then on February 5 the 'Aurora' entered a zone of bergs and broken\r\nfloe. No one slept well during that night as the ship bumped and ground\r\ninto the ice which crashed and grated along her stout sides. Davis was\r\non watch for long hours, directing in the crow's nest or down on the\r\nbridge, and throughout the next day we pushed on northwards towards the\r\ngoal which now meant so much to us--Australia--Home!\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock the sun was glittering on the great ocean outside the\r\npack-ice. Many of us climbed up in the rigging to see the fair sight--a\r\nprevision of blue skies and the calm delights of a land of eternal\r\nsummer. Our work was finished, and the good ship was rising at last to\r\nthe long swell of the southern seas.\r\n\r\nOn February 12, in latitude 55 degrees S, a strong south-wester drove\r\nbehind, and, with all sails set, the 'Aurora' made eight knots an hour.\r\nThe last iceberg was seen far away on the eastern horizon. Albatrosses\r\nfollowed in our wake, accompanied by their smaller satellites--Cape\r\nhens, priors, Lesson's and Wilson petrels.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the ice, Sandell and Bickerton had fixed an aerial\r\nbetween the fore and mizen masts, while the former installed a wireless\r\nreceiving-apparatus within the narrow limits of his cabin. There was\r\nno space on the ship to set up the motor-engine, dynamos and other\r\ninstruments necessary for transmitting messages over a long distance.\r\n\r\nAs the nights began to darken, Sandell listened eagerly for distant\r\nsignals, until on February 16, in latitude 47 degrees S, the \"calls\"\r\nof three ships in the vicinity of the Great Australian Bight were\r\nrecognized. After this date news was picked up every night, and all the\r\nitems were posted on a morning bulletin pinned up in the ward-room.\r\n\r\nThe first real touch of civilization came unexpectedly early on the\r\nmorning of February 21. A full-rigged ship on the southern horizon! It\r\nmight have been an iceberg, the sails flashed so white in the morning\r\nsun. But onward it came with a strong south-wester, overhauled and\r\npassed us, signalling \"'Archibald Russell', fifty-four days out from\r\nBuenos Ayres, bound for Cape Borda.\" It was too magical to believe.\r\n\r\nOn February 26 we gazed on distant cliffs of rock and earth--Kangaroo\r\nIsland--and the tiny cluster of dwellings round the lighthouse at\r\nCape Borda. Then we entered St. Vincent's Gulf on a clear, hot day,\r\nmarvelling at the sandy-blue water, the long, flat mainland with its\r\nclumps of trees and the smoke of many steamers.\r\n\r\nThe welcome home--the voices of innumerable strangers--the hand-grips of\r\nmany friend--it chokes one--it cannot be uttered!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n\r\n THE STAFF\r\n\r\n The Ship's Officers\r\n\r\n J.

During the Australasian\r\n Expedition he opened up a new tract of country--Queen Mary Land.\r\n\r\n I desire to make special mention of the Ship's Party who faced the\r\n rigorous conditions of Antarctica and the stormy Southern Ocean,\r\n during five separate voyages, with a cheerfulness and devotion to duty\r\n which will always stand to their lasting credit.  In regions of heavy\r\n pack-ice and sudden blizzard winds, Captain Davis piloted the Ship\r\n safely through many situations of extreme danger.  In a report to me\r\n on the work of the Ship he writes an appreciative note:--\r\n\r\n \"I wish to draw particular attention to the loyal way in which the\r\n officers and men of the 'Aurora' supported me.  Messrs. Toucher,\r\n Fletcher, Blair, Gray, de la Motte, and Gillies, in their respective\r\n positions, carried out the duties assigned to them with ability and\r\n cheerfulness, often under very trying conditions.\r\n\r\n \"Mr. Gillies not only looked after the engines but assisted\r\n materially in the deep-sea work by the invention of a new form of\r\n sounding driver which was used successfully during the various\r\n cruises of the 'Aurora'.\r\n\r\n \"The Chief Officer was in charge of the stores and equipment of the\r\n Expedition on board the vessel, in addition to his ordinary executive\r\n duties.  Messrs. Toucher, Fletcher and Blair served in this capacity\r\n on different voyages.\r\n\r\n \"Mr. P. Gray, as Second and Navigating Officer, and Mr. C. P. de\r\n la Motte, as Third Officer, acted capably and thoroughly throughout\r\n the Expedition.\"\r\n APPENDIX II\r\n\r\n Scientific Work\r\n\r\n\r\n It should be remarked that there is no intention of furnishing\r\n anything more than a suggestion of the general trend of the scientific\r\n observations of the Expedition.  The brief statement made below\r\n indicates the broad lines on which the work was conducted and in some\r\n cases the ground which was actually covered.  It may thus give the\r\n general reader a clue to the nature of the scientific volumes which\r\n will serve to record permanently the results amassed during a period\r\n of more than two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n Terrestrial Magnetism\r\n\r\n 1.  Field Work.\r\n\r\n (a) Dip determinations were made at Macquarie Island, on the eastern\r\n and southern journeys from the Main Base (Adelie Land) and on a\r\n short journey from the Western Base (Queen Mary Land).\r\n\r\n (b) Declination by theodolite observations was determined at\r\n Macquarie Island and at intervals on all sledging journeys in the\r\n Antarctic.\r\n\r\n (c) Rough observations of magnetic variation were made daily on the\r\n 'Aurora' during her five cruises.\r\n\r\n 2.  Station Work.\r\n\r\n (a) Regular magnetograph records were kept at the Main Base (Adelie Land)\r\n for a period of eighteen months.  A system of term days for quick runs\r\n was also followed; Melbourne, Christchurch, and other stations co\r\n operating.  In connexion with the magnetograph work, Webb conducted\r\n regular, absolute observations throughout the year 1912.  Bage continued\r\n the magnetograph records for a further six months in 1913, observed\r\n term days, and took absolute observations.\r\n\r\n (b) At the Western Base (Queen Mary Land) Kennedy kept term days in\r\n the winter, using a magnetometer and dip-circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n Biology\r\n\r\n 1.  Station Collections.\r\n\r\n (a) At Macquarie Island, Hamilton worked for two years amongst a rich\r\n fauna and a scanty but interesting flora.  Amongst other discoveries\r\n a finch indigenous to Macquarie Island was found.\r\n\r\n (b) In Adelie Land, Hunter, assisted by Laseron, secured a large\r\n biological collection, notwithstanding the continuous bad weather.\r\n Dredgings from depths down to fifty fathoms were made during the\r\n winter.  The eggs of practically all the flying birds known along\r\n Antarctic shores were obtained, including those of the silver-grey\r\n petrel and the Antarctic petrel, which were not previously known;\r\n also a variety of prion, of an unrecorded species, together with its\r\n eggs.\r\n\r\n (c) At the Western Base (Queen Mary Land) eggs of the Antarctic and\r\n other petrels were found, and a large rookery of Emperor penguins was\r\n located; the second on record.  Harrisson, working under difficulties,\r\n succeeded in trapping some interesting fish on the bottom in two\r\n hundred and fifty fathoms of water.\r\n\r\n 2.  Ship Collections.\r\n\r\n (a) A collection made by Mr. E. R. Waite, Curator of the Canterbury\r\n Museum, on the first Sub-Antarctic cruise.\r\n\r\n (b) A collection made by Professor T. T. Flynn, of Hobart, on the\r\n second Sub-Antarctic cruise.\r\n\r\n (c) A collection made by Hunter, assisted by Hamilton, in Antarctic\r\n waters during the summer of 1913-1914.  This comprised deep-sea\r\n dredgings at eleven stations in depths down to one thousand eight\r\n hundred fathoms and regular tow-nettings, frequently serial, to\r\n depths of two hundred fathoms.  Six specimens of the rare Ross seal\r\n were secured.  A large collection of external and internal parasites\r\n was made from birds, seals and fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n Geology\r\n\r\n (a) A geological examination of Macquarie Island was made by Blake.\r\n The older rocks were found to be all igneous.  The Island has been\r\n overridden in comparatively recent times by an ice-cap travelling\r\n from west to east.\r\n\r\n (b) Geological collections at the Main Base.  In Adelie Land the rocky\r\n outcrops are metamorphic sediments and gneisses.  In King George V\r\n Land there is a formation similar to the Beacon sandstones and dolerites\r\n of the Ross Sea, with which carbonaceous shales and coaly strata are\r\n associated.\r\n\r\n (c) Stillwell met with a great range of minerals and rocks in the\r\n terminal moraine near Winter Quarters, Adelie Land.  Amongst them was\r\n red sandstone in abundance, suggesting that the Beacon sandstone\r\n formation extends also throughout Adelie Land but is hidden by the\r\n ice-cap.  A solitary stony meteorite was found by a sledging party\r\n lying on the ice of the plateau.\r\n\r\n (d) In the collections made by Watson and Hoadley at the Western\r\n Base (Queen Mary Land) gneisses and schists were ascertained to be\r\n the predominant types.\r\n\r\n (e) A collection of erratics was brought up by the deep-sea trawl in\r\n the course of dredgings in Antarctic waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n Glaciology\r\n\r\n (a) Observations of the pack-ice, coastal glaciers and shelf-ice from\r\n the 'Aurora' during her three Antarctic cruises.\r\n\r\n (b) Observations of the niveous and glacial features met with on the\r\n sledging journeys from both Antarctic bases.\r\n\r\n\r\n Meteorology\r\n\r\n (a) Two years' observations at Macquarie Island by Ainsworth\r\n\r\n (b) Two years' observations in Adelie Land by Madigan.\r\n\r\n (c) One year's observations in Queen Mary Land by Moyes.\r\n\r\n (d) Observations by the Ship on each of her five voyages.\r\n\r\n (e) Observations during the many sledging journeys from both\r\n       Antarctic Bases.\r\n\r\n\r\n Bacteriology, etc.\r\n\r\n In Adelie Land, McLean carried out many months of steady work in\r\n Bacteriology, Haematology and Physiology.\r\n\r\n\r\n Tides\r\n\r\n Self-recording instruments were run at Macquarie Island by Ainsworth\r\n and at Adelie Land by Bage.\r\n\r\n\r\n Wireless and Auroral  Observations\r\n\r\n A very close watch was kept upon auroral phenomena with interesting\r\n results, especially in their relation to the \"permeability\" of the\r\n ether to wireless waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n Geographical Results\r\n\r\n 1.  The successful navigation by the 'Aurora' of the Antarctic pack\r\n ice in a fresh sphere of action, where the conditions were practically\r\n unknown, resulting in the discovery of new lands and islands.\r\n\r\n 2.  Journeys were made over the sea-ice and on the coastal and upland\r\n plateau in regions hitherto unsurveyed.  At the Main Base (Adelie\r\n Land) the journeys aggregated two thousand four hundred miles, and at\r\n the Western Base (Queen Mary Land) the aggregate was eight hundred\r\n miles.  These figures do not include depot journeys, the journeys of\r\n supporting parties, or the many miles of relay work.  The land was\r\n mapped in through 33 degrees of longitude, 27 degrees of which were\r\n covered by sledging parties.\r\n\r\n 3.  The employment of wireless telegraphy in the fixation of a\r\n fundamental meridian in Adelie Land.\r\n\r\n 4.  The mapping of Macquarie Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n [TEXT ILLUSTRATIONS]\r\n\r\n A Section of the Antarctic Plateau from the Coast to a Point Three\r\n Hundred Miles Inland, along the Route followed by the Southern\r\n Sledging Party (Adelie Land)\r\n\r\n A Section across the Antarctic Continent through the South Magnetic\r\n Pole from the D'Urville Sea to the Ross Sea; Compiled from Observations\r\n made by the British Antarctic Expedition (1907-1909) and by the\r\n Australian Antarctic Expedition (1911-1914)\r\n\r\n\r\n Oceanography\r\n\r\n 1.

R.\r\n Mill's \"The Siege of the South Pole.\"  Several doubtful voyages\r\n during the early part of the nineteenth century have been omitted.\r\n\r\n 1775.  James Cook circumnavigated the Globe in high southern\r\n latitudes, discovering the sub-antarctic island of South Georgia.\r\n He was the first to cross the Antarctic Circle.\r\n\r\n 1819.  William Smith, the master of a merchant vessel trading between\r\n Montevideo and Valparaiso, discovered the South Shetland Islands.\r\n\r\n 1819.  Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, despatched in command of an\r\n Expedition by the Emperor, Alexander I of Russia, with instructions\r\n to supplement the voyage of Captain Cook, circumnavigated the\r\n Antarctic continent in high southern latitudes.  The first discovery\r\n of land south of the Antarctic Circle was made, namely, Peter I Island\r\n and Alexander I Land (also an island), in the American Quadrant of\r\n Antarctica.\r\n\r\n 1820.  Nathaniel Palmer, master of an American sealing-vessel, sighted\r\n new land to the south of the South Shetland Islands.  It seems clear\r\n that he was the first to view what is now known as the Palmer\r\n Archipelago (1820-21).\r\n\r\n 1823.  James Weddell, a British sealer, sailing southward of the\r\n Atlantic Ocean, reached 74 degrees 15' south latitude in the American\r\n Quadrant, establishing a \"farthest south\" record.\r\n\r\n 1830.  John Biscoe, a whaling master of the British firm of Enderby\r\n Brothers, sailed on a voyage circumnavigating the Antarctic Regions.\r\n Enderby Land was discovered south of the West Indian Ocean in the\r\n African Quadrant of Antarctica.  This was apparently a part of the\r\n Antarctic continent.  New land was also met with to the south of\r\n America and charted as Graham's Land, Biscoe Island and Adelaide\r\n Island.\r\n\r\n Kemp, a sailing master of Enderby Brothers, extended Biscoe's\r\n discoveries shortly after by the report of land east of, and\r\n adjacent to, Enderby Land.\r\n\r\n Neither of these discoveries has yet been proved, though Enderby Land\r\n (Biscoe) undoubtedly exists.\r\n\r\n 1839.  John Balleny, another of Enderby's whaling captains, discovered\r\n the Balleny Islands within the Antarctic Circle, in the Australian\r\n Quadrant of Antarctica, and gave a vague description of an appearance\r\n of land to the westward.  This has been charted on maps, without\r\n adequate evidence, as Sabrina Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n [TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\n Antarctic Land Discoveries Preceding 1838\r\n\r\n Note.  This and the two following maps of the series illustrate land\r\n discoveries only.  In cases where the existence of land once reported\r\n has since been disproved no record at all is shown\r\n\r\n\r\n 1837.  Jules Sebastian Cesar Dumont D'Urville, was despatched by King\r\n Louis Philippe of France for the prosecution of scientific researches\r\n on a voyage round the World.  His cruise in the Antarctic resulted in\r\n the charting of Joinville Island and Louis Philippe Land to the south\r\n of America (American Quadrant) and the discovery of a portion of the\r\n Antarctic continent, named Adelie Land, southward of Australia\r\n (Australian Quadrant).\r\n\r\n 1838.  Charles Wilkes, United States Navy, in accordance with a bill\r\n passed by Congress, set out on an exploring expedition to circumnavigate\r\n the World.  His programme included the investigation of the area of\r\n the Antarctic to the south of Australia--the Australian Quadrant.\r\n The squadron composing this American expedition first visited the\r\n Antarctic regions in the American Quadrant, and then proceeded eastward\r\n round to the Australian Quadrant from which, after a long cruise, they\r\n returned, reporting land at frequent intervals in the vicinity of the\r\n Antarctic Circle between longitudes 157 degrees 46' E. and 106 degrees\r\n 19' E.  He shares with D'Urville the full honour of the discovery of\r\n Adelie Land.  Some of the supposed landfalls known to be non-existent.\r\n\r\n 1839.  James Clark Ross proceeded south in charge of a scientific\r\n expedition fitted out by the Admiralty at the instance of the British\r\n Association for the Advancement of Science and approved of by the Royal\r\n Society.  His aim was to circumnavigate the Antarctic regions and to\r\n investigate the Weddell Sea.  The geographical results were fruitful;\r\n the Ross Sea, the Admiralty Range and the Great Ice Barrier were\r\n discovered and some eight hundred miles of Antarctic coastline were\r\n broadly delineated.\r\n\r\n 1844.  T. E. L. Moore was detailed by the Admiralty to supplement\r\n the magnetic work of Ross and to explore to the southward of Africa\r\n and of the Indian Ocean, but no additions were made to geographical\r\n knowledge.\r\n\r\n 1872.  Eduard Dallmann, whilst engaged in whaling with a German\r\n steamer to the southward of America, added some details to the map of\r\n the Palmer Archipelago but did not go further south than 64 degrees\r\n 45' S. Iatitude.\r\n\r\n 1874.  The 'Challenger' scientific expedition, under the command of\r\n George Strong Nares, in the course of their voyage from the Cape to\r\n Australia during the circumnavigation of the World penetrated within\r\n the Antarctic Circle in longitude 78 degrees 22' E.\r\n\r\n 1892.  A fleet of four Scottish whalers cruised through the north\r\n western part of the Weddell Sea.  Scientific observations were made\r\n by W. S. Bruce and others, but no geographical discoveries were\r\n recorded.\r\n\r\n 1892.  C. A. Larsen, master of a Hamburg whaler, added important\r\n details to the geography of the American Quadrant of Antarctica on\r\n the western side of the Weddell Sea.\r\n\r\n 1894.  Evensen, master of another Hamburg whaler, brought back further\r\n information of the American Quadrant on the Pacific Ocean side.\r\n\r\n 1895.  H.  J.  Bull organized a whaling venture and with Leonard\r\n Kristensen, master of the ship, revisited the Ross Sea area where\r\n a landing was made at Cape Adare (Australian Quadrant).  This was the\r\n first occasion on which any human being had set foot on the Antarctic\r\n continent.\r\n\r\n [TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\n Antarctic land Discoveries Preceding 1896    (A. J. Hodgeman)\r\n\r\n\r\n 1897.  Adrien de Gerlache sailed from Belgium on a scientific exploring\r\n expedition to the American Quadrant.  Important additions were made to\r\n the map, but the ship became frozen into the pack-ice and drifted about\r\n for a whole year south of the Antarctic Circle.  The members of this\r\n expedition were the first to experience an Antarctic winter.  Antarctic\r\n exploration now entered upon a new era.\r\n\r\n 1898.  Carstens Egeberg Borchgrevink led an expedition, fitted out by\r\n Sir George Newnes; its objective being the Ross Sea area.  Further\r\n details were added to the map, but the most notable fact was that the\r\n expedition wintered at Cape Adare, on the mainland itself.  The Great\r\n Ross Barrier was determined to be thirty miles south of the position\r\n assigned by Ross in 1839.\r\n\r\n 1898.  Chun of Leipsig, in charge of the 'Valdivia' Expedition, carried\r\n out oceanographical researches far to the south, in the vicinity of\r\n Enderby Land (African Quadrant), though he did not come within sight\r\n of the continent.\r\n\r\n 1901.  Robert Falcon Scott, in command of the 'Discovery' Expedition,\r\n organised by the Royal Geographical Society and Royal Society with\r\n the co-operation of the Admiralty, in accordance with a scheme of\r\n international endeavour, passed two winters at the southern extremity\r\n of the Ross Sea and carried out many successful sledging journeys.\r\n Their main geographical achievements were: the discovery of King\r\n Edward VII Land; several hundred miles of new land on a \"farthest\r\n south\" sledging journey to latitude 82 degrees 17' S.; the discovery\r\n of the Antarctic plateau; additional details and original contributions\r\n to the geography of the lands and islands of the Ross Sea.\r\n\r\n 1901.  A German national expedition, led by Erich von Drygalski, set\r\n out for the region south of the Indian Ocean.  After a small party\r\n had been stationed on Kerguelen Island, the main party proceeded\r\n south close to the tracks of the Challenger.  They came within sight\r\n of Antarctic shores but were frozen into the pack-ice for a whole\r\n year.  Kaiser Wilhelm II Land was discovered close to the junction\r\n between the Australian and African Quadrants.\r\n\r\n 1901.  A Swedish national expedition, planned and led by Otto\r\n Nordenskjold, wintered for two years on Snow Hill Island in the\r\n American Quadrant, and did much valuable scientific work.\r\n\r\n 1902.  William Speirs Bruce organized and led a Scottish expedition to\r\n the Weddell Sea, southward of the Atlantic Ocean.  The party effected\r\n notable oceanographic researches and wintered at the South Orkney\r\n Islands, but were foiled in their attempt to penetrate the pack-ice.\r\n During the second season, conditions were more favourable and the ship\r\n reached Coats Land in 74 degrees 1' S. Iatitude.\r\n\r\n 1903.  Jean Charcot organized and led a French expedition to the\r\n American Quadrant and there added many details to the existing chart.\r\n\r\n 1907.  Ernest Henry Shackleton organized and led a British\r\n expedition with the main object of reaching the South Geographical\r\n Pole.  His party wintered at Cape Royds, McMurdo Sound, and two main\r\n sledging parties set out in the early summer.  E. H. Shackleton's\r\n party ascended the Antarctic plateau and penetrated to within ninety\r\n seven geographical miles of the South Pole, discovering new land beyond\r\n Scott's \"farthest south.\"  T. W. Edgeworth David's party reached the\r\n South Magnetic Polar Area, filling in many details of the western coast\r\n of McMurdo Sound.\r\n\r\n 1908.  Jean Charcot organized and led a second French expedition to\r\n extend the work accomplished in 1903 in the American Quadrant.  He was\r\n successful in discovering new land still further to the south.\r\n Loubet, Fallieres and Charcot Lands, towards and beyond Alexander I\r\n Land, were added to the map of Antarctica.\r\n\r\n 1910.  Roald Amundsen organized an expedition for scientific research\r\n in the vicinity of the North Pole but changed his plans, eventually\r\n heading for the South Pole.  The expedition wintered on the Ross\r\n Barrier near King Edward VII Land, from which point he set out and\r\n attained the South Geographical Pole, mapping in new land on the way.\r\n Another party visited King Edward VII Land.\r\n\r\n 1910.  Robert Falcon Scott led a second Antarctic expedition, the main\r\n object of which was to reach the South Geographical Pole.  The\r\n principal party wintered near his old winter quarters at Hut Point,\r\n McMurdo Sound.  A second party was landed at Cape Adare.  Scott\r\n reached the Pole soon after the Norwegian Amundsen, but he and his\r\n party perished on the return journey.  Other parties added details to\r\n the map of Victoria Land.  Oates Land was sighted from the ship to the\r\n westward of Cape Adare in the Australian Quadrant.\r\n\r\n 1910.  A Japanese expedition sailed to the Ross Sea, but on account of\r\n the lateness of the season was forced to turn back without landing.\r\n The winter was spent at Sydney, New South Wales.  Next year a summer\r\n visit was made to the South, but no additional land discoveries were\r\n made.\r\n\r\n 1911.  A German expedition, led by Wilhelm Filchner, proceeded to the\r\n Weddell Sea; the South Pole being its objective.  The party\r\n succeeded in reaching further south in that region than any previous\r\n navigators and discovered new land, to be named Prince Luitpold Land.\r\n They were driven northwards amongst the pack in a blizzard and spent\r\n the winter frozen in south of Coats Land.\r\n\r\n [TEXT ILLUSTRATION]\r\n\r\n         A Map of the Antarctic Regions as Known at the Present Day\r\n             [1915]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n APPENDIX IV\r\n\r\n Glossary\r\n\r\n Oceanography.  The study of the ocean, including the shape and\r\n character of its bed, the temperature and salinity of the water at\r\n various depths, the force and set of its currents, and the nature of\r\n the creatures and plants which haunt its successive zones.\r\n\r\n Neve.  [n,e acute, v, e acute] The compacted snow of a snow-field;\r\n a stage in the transition between soft, loose snow and glacier-ice.\r\n\r\n Sastrugi.  The waves caused by continuous winds blowing across the\r\n surface of an expanse of snow.  These waves vary in size according to\r\n the force and continuity of the wind and the compactness of the snow.\r\n The word is of Russian derivation (from zastruga [sing.], zastrugi\r\n [pl.] ), denoting snow-waves or the irregularities on the surface of\r\n roughly-planed wood.\r\n\r\n Ice-foot.  A sheath of ice adhering along the shores of polar lands.\r\n The formation may be composed of attached remnants of floe-ice,\r\n frozen sea-spray and drift-snow.\r\n\r\n Nunatak.  An island-like outcrop of rock projecting through a sheet of\r\n enveloping land-ice.\r\n\r\n Shelf-ice.  A thick, floating, fresh water ice-formation pushing out\r\n from the land and continuous with an extensive glacier.  Narrow\r\n prolongations or peninsulas of the shelf-ice may be referred to as\r\n ice-tongues or glacier-tongues.\r\n\r\n Barrier is a term which has been rather loosely applied in the\r\n literature of Antarctic Exploration.  Formerly it was used to\r\n describe a formation, which is mainly shelf-ice, known as the Great\r\n Ross Barrier.  Confusion arose when \"Barrier\" came to be applied to\r\n the seaward ice-cliff (resting on rock) of an extensive sheet of\r\n land-ice and when it was also employed to designate a line of\r\n consolidated pack-ice.  Spelt with a small \"b\" the term is a\r\n convenient one, so long as it carries its ordinary meaning; it seems\r\n unnecessary to give it a technical connotation.\r\n\r\n Blizzard.  A high wind at a low temperature, accompanied by drifting,\r\n not necessarily falling snow.\r\n\r\n Floe or Floe-ice.  The comparatively flat, frozen surface of the sea\r\n intersected by cracks and leads (channels of open water).\r\n\r\n Pack or Pack-ice is a field of loose ice originating in the main from\r\n broken floe, to which may be added material from the disintegration\r\n of bergs, and bergs themselves.\r\n\r\n Brash or Brash-ice.  Small, floating fragments of ice--the debris of\r\n larger pieces--usually observed bordering a tract of pack-ice.\r\n\r\n Bergschrund has been \"freely rendered\" in the description of the\r\n great cleft between the lower part of the Denman Glacier and the\r\n Shackleton Shelf-Ice (Queen Mary Land).  In a typical glacier, \"the\r\n upper portion is hidden by neve and often by freshly fallen snow\r\n and is smooth and unbroken.  During the summer, when little snow\r\n falls, the body of the glacier moves away from the snow-field and a\r\n gaping crevasse of great depth is usually established, called a\r\n 'Bergschrund', which is sometimes taken as the upper limit of the\r\n glacier\" (\"Encyclopaedia Britannica\").\r\n\r\n Sub-Antarctica.  A general term used to denote the area of ocean,\r\n containing islands and encircling the Antarctic continent, between the\r\n vicinity of the 50th parallel of south latitude and the confines of\r\n the ice-covered sea.\r\n\r\n Seracs are wedged masses of icy pinnacles which are produced in the\r\n surface of a glacier by dragging strains which operate on crevassed\r\n areas.  A field of such pinnacles, jammed together in broken\r\n confusion, is called serac-ice\r\n\r\n The following colloquial words or phrases occurring in the narrative\r\n were largely determined by general usage:\r\n To depot = to cache or to place a stock of provisions in a depot;\r\n drift = drift-snow;\r\n fifty-mile wind = a wind of fifty miles an hour;\r\n burberry = \"Burberry gabardine\" or specially prepared wind-proof\r\n             clothing;\r\n whirly (pi. whirlies) = whirlwind carrying drift-snow and pursuing a\r\n              devious track;\r\n night-watchman = night-watch;\r\n glaxo = \"Glaxo\" (a powder of dried milk);\r\n primus = primus stove used during sledging;\r\n hoosh = pemmican and plasmon biscuit \"porridge\";\r\n tanks = canvas bags for holding sledging provisions;\r\n boil-up = sledging meal;\r\n ramp = bank of snow slanting away obliquely on the leeward side of an\r\n           obstacle;\r\n radiant = an appearance noted in clouds (especially cirro-stratus)\r\n               which seem to radiate from a point on the horizon\r\n\r\n The following appended list may be of biological interest:\r\n\r\n      Birds                                 Aves\r\n\r\n Emperor penguin                          Aptenodytes forsteri\r\n King penguin                             Aptenodytes patagonica\r\n Adelie penguin                           Pygoscelis adeliae\r\n Royal penguin                            Catarrhactes schlegeli\r\n Victoria penguin                         Catarrhactes pachyrynchus\r\n Gentoo or Rockhopper penguin             Pygoscelis papua\r\n\r\n Wandering albatross                      Diomedea exulans\r\n Mollymawk or Black-browed albatross      Diomedea melanophrys\r\n Sooty albatross                          Phoebetria fuliginosa\r\n Giant petrel or nelly                    Ossifraga gigantea\r\n MacCormick's skua gull                   Megalestris maccormicki\r\n Southern skua gull                       Megalestris antarctica\r\n Antarctic petrel                         Thalassoeca antarctica\r\n Silver-grey petrel or southern fulmar    Priocella glacialoides\r\n Cape pigeon                              Daption capensis\r\n Snow petrel                              Pagodroma nivea\r\n Lesson's petrel                          Oestrelata lessoni\r\n Wilson petrel                            Oceanites oceanicus\r\n Storm petrel                             Fregetta melanogaster\r\n Cape hen                                 Majaqueus oequinoctialis\r\n Small prion or whale bird                Prion banksii\r\n Crested tern                             Sterna sp.\r\n Southern black-backed or Dominican gull  Larus dominicanus\r\n Macquarie Island shag                    Phalacrocorax traversi\r\n Mutton bird                              Puffinus griseus\r\n Maori hen or \"weka\"                    Ocydromus scotti\r\n\r\n\r\n Seals                                    Pinnipedia\r\n\r\n Sea elephant                             Macrorhinus leoninus\r\n Sea-leopard                              Stenorhynchus leptonyax\r\n Weddell seal                             Leptonychotes weddelli\r\n Crab-eater seal                          Lobodon carcinophagus\r\n Ross seal                                Ommatophoca rossi\r\n\r\n Whales and Dolphins                      Cetacea\r\n\r\n Rorqual, finner, or blue whale           Balaenoptera sibbaldi\r\n Killer whale                             Orca gladiator\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n APPENDIX V\r\n\r\n Medical Reports\r\n\r\n\r\n Western Base (Queen Mary Land)\r\n\r\n by S. E. Jones, M.B., CH.M.\r\n\r\n There was a very marked absence of serious illness during the whole\r\n period of our stay at the Base.  After the 'Aurora' left Adelie Land\r\n on January 19, 1912, for her western cruise, an epidemic of influenza\r\n broke out.  It should be noted that one case occurred on the voyage\r\n south from Hobart, and then an interval of almost a month occurred\r\n before the infection spread.  An interesting feature of the outbreak\r\n was the fact that the recovery of those who were convalescing, when\r\n we arrived at Queen Mary Land, was much more rapid than was the case\r\n with those whose convalescence occurred on the Ship.\r\n\r\n By the careful use of snow-goggles during the summer, snow-blindness\r\n was practically prevented, and such cases as occurred yielded quickly\r\n when zinc and cocaine tablets were used and the eyes obtained rest.\r\n An undoubted factor in the causation of snow-blindness is the strain\r\n caused by the continual efforts at visual accommodation made\r\n necessary on dull days when the sun is obscured, and there is a\r\n complete absence of all light-and-shade contrast.\r\n\r\n Although frostbites were frequent during the winter months, immediate\r\n attention to the restoration of circulation prevented the occurrence\r\n of after-effects, so that no one suffered the loss of any more tissue\r\n than the superficial epithelium.  The nose, ears, fingers and toes\r\n were the parts which suffered first.\r\n\r\n Our supplies of food were excellent in point of view of variety.  Some\r\n tinned onions were responsible for several mild attacks of poisoning,\r\n but these were not used after our first experience.  There was no sign\r\n of scurvy in any form.\r\n\r\n Hoadley, on one occasion, had an unpleasant experience.  He was alone\r\n in the hut sleeping one night when he awoke to find the room filled\r\n with smoke.  On going outside he found that the chimney had become\r\n blocked with snow; as the fire was banked, the hut was filled with the\r\n gases from the imperfect combustion of the coal.  It was three or four\r\n days before Hoadley recovered from his experience, having marked\r\n symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.\r\n\r\n On my return from the Western Depot journey I found that Wild was\r\n suffering from an attack of herpes zoster.  The illness came on while\r\n he was out sledging, and he suffered severely from the pain and\r\n irritation.\r\n\r\n Beyond a few cases of minor illness, and one or two accidents, there\r\n was nothing of serious moment to report.\r\n\r\n\r\n Main Base (Adelie Land)\r\n\r\n by A. L. McLean, M.B., CH.M., B.A.\r\n\r\n Throughout the whole period of the Expedition--from December 2, 1911,\r\n to February 26, 1914--the health of the expedition was remarkably\r\n good.  Undoubtedly Antarctica has a salubrious climate, and it is\r\n simply because one returns in a measure to the primitive that such an\r\n ideal result is obtained.\r\n\r\n The first thing to resist is the cold, and additional clothing is the\r\n first and adequate means to such an end.  No one needs to be specially\r\n inured to a rigorous climate.  If he has a normal circulation he\r\n immediately reacts to a new set of temperature conditions, and in a\r\n few weeks may claim to be acclimatized.  Most of the members of the\r\n expedition were Australians, so that the change of latitudes was\r\n rather abrupt but none the less stimulating and healthful.\r\n\r\n Appetite for food had suddenly a new piquancy, hard manual work was\r\n a pleasure in a novel and wonderful environment, the intellect and\r\n imagination were quickened and the whole man embodied the mens sana\r\n in corpore sano.  That is why illness was practically unknown for more\r\n than two years; and, further, it may be said with partial truth that\r\n in the high sense of physical and mental fitness he possessed for a\r\n time, lies the explanation of the proverbial desire of an explorer\r\n to return to the ice-lands.\r\n\r\n Regular monthly examinations of the blood were made from the date of\r\n leaving Hobart in December 1911 until October 1912, with an interval\r\n of about nine weeks between the first and second examinations.  The\r\n haemoglobin or red colouring-matter went up with a leap and then very\r\n steadily increased in amount during the winter months in Adelie Land.\r\n The blood pressure became slightly more marked, the weight increased,\r\n but as one might have expected, the resistance to ordinary civilized\r\n germs was decreased.  With regard to weight, the maximum amount gained\r\n by a single individual during a period of eight weeks was almost two\r\n stones, and every one became heavier by as much as ten pounds.  As\r\n clinical evidence of the loss in immunity may be quoted the epidemic\r\n of influenza to which Dr. S. E. Jones referred.  As well, it was noted\r\n that several members had attacks of \"boils\" during the voyage\r\n southward; in Adelie Land during 1912 there were two instances of acute\r\n abscesses on the fingers (whitlows) and one jaw abscess.  It appears as\r\n if, with its new and unbounded energy of function, the body attempts to\r\n throw oft its waste products.  Then, too, experimental observations of\r\n opsonic index pointed towards the lowering of resistance, and, by the\r\n way, it was rather a remarkable fact that after a few months in Adelie\r\n Land, staphylococcus pyogenes aureus--a common germ in civilization-\r\n could not be cultivated artificially from the throat, nose or skin, of\r\n six individuals from whom monthly bacteriological cultures were made.\r\n\r\n Within the Hut, at a temperature which ranged from 40 degrees to\r\n 45 degrees F., the number of micro-organisms continuously increased,\r\n if the exposure of agar plates at regular intervals (by night) gave\r\n a true indication.  The organisms were staphylocci albi, bacilli, yeasts,\r\n and moulds; the latter overgrowing the plate after it had been for forty\r\n eight hours in the incubator.\r\n\r\n Frostbites were common, but, perhaps for that reason, were not regarded\r\n seriously.  No one suffered permanent harm from being frost-bitten,\r\n though in several cases rather extensive blisters formed and nails and\r\n skin were lost.\r\n\r\n Whilst the Hut was being built, minor casualties often occurred; the\r\n common remedy being to cover the injured part with a small piece of\r\n gauze surrounded by adhesive tape; for open wounds will not heal\r\n when exposed to the cold.  The Greenland dogs had small accidents and\r\n ailments which often required treatment.\r\n\r\n On sledging journeys snow-blindness was an affection which sooner or\r\n later caught every one in an unguarded moment.  That moment was when\r\n he ceased to use goggles if the light were at all trying to his eyes.\r\n Prevention came first, and then the \"zinc and cocaine\" cure.\r\n\r\n Adelie Land can only be regarded as an intolerable country in which\r\n to live, owing to the never-ceasing winds.  Usage and necessity\r\n helped one to regard the weather in the best possible light; for the\r\n sake of a few hours of calm which might be expected to occasionally\r\n intervene between the long spells of the blizzards.  It is, therefore,\r\n with regret and some diffldence that I speak of the illness of Mr. S.\r\n N. Jeffryes, who took up so conscientiously the duties of wireless\r\n operator during the second year (1913); but upon whom the monotony\r\n of a troglodytic winter life made itself felt.  It is my hope that he\r\n is fast recovering his former vigour and enthusiasm.**\r\n\r\n So many miles of sledging were done at both Antarctic Bases in a\r\n climate which is surely without a parallel in the history of polar\r\n travelling, the Ship was so often in jeopardy during her three main\r\n cruises to the South, that we feel the meagre comment should be made\r\n on our providential return to civilization with the loss of two\r\n comrades whose memory will ever be imperishable to each one of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n      ** With the advent of summer, Jeffryes became normal, but unfortunately\r\n suffered a temporary relapse upon his return to Australia.--D. M.\r\n APPENDIX VI\r\n\r\n Finance\r\n\r\n A General reference was made to the finances of the expedition in the\r\n Introduction.  Here is an extended statement which, more fully amplified\r\n with a detailed list of donations, will be again published when\r\n additional funds have been raised to pay off the debit balance and\r\n establish equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n GRANTS AND DONATIONS\r\n\r\n AUSTRALIA, January 1911:                                           L\r\n\r\n Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, L1000;\r\n R.

Brown of Newcastle (N.S.W.), Mr. H. D. Murphy (Melbourne),\r\n and the Lithgow Collieries Company.\r\n APPENDIX VII\r\n\r\n\r\n Equipment\r\n\r\n Clothing\r\n\r\n With regard to the clothing, the main bulk was of woollen material\r\n as supplied by Jaeger of London.  This firm is unexcelled in the\r\n production of camel's-hair garments and has supplied most polar\r\n expeditions of recent years with underclothing, gloves, caps, and\r\n the like.  From the same firm we also secured heavy ski-boots,\r\n finnesko-crampons, and the blankets which were used at Winter Quarters\r\n at both Antarctic Bases.  Some of the Jaeger woollens were damaged\r\n by sea water on the voyage from London to Australia and were replaced\r\n by Eagley goods; an Australian brand, which proved very satisfactory.\r\n The Ship's Party were outfitted with Kaipoi woollens (New Zealand).\r\n\r\n Outer garments were made up to our design from Jaeger fleece by\r\n tailors in Hobart.  The suit consisted of a single garment, to be worn\r\n with combination underclothing, and was calculated to meet the\r\n requirements of a severe climate.\r\n\r\n An over-suit of wind-proof material, which may be worn when required,\r\n is a necessary adjunct to woollen clothing.  Such a suit should have\r\n the additional properties of being light, strong, not readily\r\n absorbing moisture, and not affected by the cold.  Burberry\r\n gabardine was found to possess all these properties, and two complete\r\n suits were made up for each man.  One suit consisted of three pieces,\r\n whilst the other was made of two; the blouse-jacket and helmet of the\r\n latter being combined.\r\n\r\n Furs, which were obtained from Norway, were restricted to sleeping\r\n bags, finnesko or fur-boots, and wolfskin mitts (Lapland).\r\n\r\n The outfit of clothing for the party at Macquarie Island and on the\r\n Ship, respectively, differed from that used in the Antarctic.  Warmer\r\n temperatures and wet conditions had to be taken into account, and so\r\n rubber boots, oilskins, and rubberized materials were provided as\r\n outer coverings.\r\n\r\n Food\r\n\r\n The food-stuffs were selected with at least as much consideration as\r\n was given to any of the other requisites.  The successful work of an\r\n expedition depends on the health of the men who form its members, and\r\n good and suitable food reduces to a minimum the danger of scurvy; a\r\n scourge which has marred many polar enterprises.  Thus our\r\n provisioning was arranged with care and as a result of my previous\r\n experience in the Antarctic with Sir Ernest Shackleton's Expedition.\r\n\r\n A summary which may be of possible use to future expeditions is\r\n appended below:\r\n\r\n In the matter of canned meats we had some six tons of the excellent\r\n Australian article supplied by the Sydney Meat Preserving Company,\r\n Ramornie Meat Company (N.S.W.), Baynes Brothers (Brisbane), and the\r\n Border (rabbit) Preserving Company of South Australia.  For use on\r\n the Ship three tons of salt beef and pork served to replenish the\r\n \"harness cask,\" largely obtained in Melbourne from Cook and Sons.\r\n\r\n For a ton of sauces and pickles we were indebted to Brand and Company\r\n (London) and to Mason and Company (London).\r\n\r\n Of course fresh meat was consumed as far as possible; a number of\r\n live sheep being taken by the 'Aurora' on each cruise.  Some of these\r\n were killed and dressed after reaching 60 degrees south latitude and\r\n supplied our two Antarctic Bases with the luxury of fresh mutton\r\n about once a week throughout a year.\r\n\r\n One ton of preserved suet came from the firms of Hugon (Manchester)\r\n and Conrad (Adelaide).\r\n\r\n Almost all our bacon and ham, amounting to well over one ton, was of\r\n the Pineapple Brand (Sydney), and to the firm which supplied them we\r\n are indebted alike for the quality of its goods and for its generosity.\r\n\r\n Soups in endless variety, totalling two tons, came chiefly from the\r\n Flemington Meat Preserving Company (Melbourne).\r\n\r\n Fours tons of canned fish were supplied by C. & E. Morton (London).\r\n\r\n Variety in vegetables was considered important.  We decided to reduce\r\n the amount of dried vegetables in favour of canned vegetables.  About\r\n six and a half tons of the latter in addition to one ton of canned\r\n potatoes were consumed; from Laver Brothers (Melbourne) and Heinz\r\n (Pittsburgh).  There were one and a half tons of dried vegetables.\r\n In addition, large quantities of fresh potatoes and other vegetables\r\n were regularly carried by the 'Aurora', and many bags of new and old\r\n potatoes were landed at the Main Base.  In the frozen condition, the\r\n former kept satisfactorily, though they were somewhat sodden when\r\n thawed.  The old potatoes, on the other hand, became black and useless,\r\n partly owing to the comparatively high temperature of the ship's hold,\r\n and in part to the warmth of the sun during the first few weeks in\r\n Adelie Land.\r\n\r\n Canned fruits, to the extent of five tons, were supplied by Jones\r\n Brothers (Hobart) and Laver Brothers (Melbourne).  This stock was eked\r\n out by some two and a half tons of dried fruits, chiefly from South\r\n Australia.\r\n\r\n The management of Hartley (London) presented us with two tons of jam,\r\n and James Keiller and Son (London) with one ton of marmalade.\r\n\r\n Of the twelve tons of sugar and half a ton of syrup consumed, all were\r\n generously donated by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Sydney).\r\n\r\n For milk we were provided with two tons of Glaxo (a dry powder) which\r\n was used at the land bases, and a ton and a half of Nestle's condensed\r\n variety for use on the ship.\r\n\r\n Three tons of cereal meals, largely from Parsons (Sydney), were\r\n consumed.\r\n\r\n As one might have expected, the amount of flour used was enormous.\r\n In the thirteen tons of this commodity from Colman (London) there were\r\n three varieties, self-rising, plain, and wheatmeal flour, encased in\r\n stout metal linings within strong, well-finished cases of a convenient\r\n size.  Until required, the cases of flour were used to solidify the\r\n break-wind on the southern side of the Hut.\r\n\r\n Bird and Company (Birmingham) more than satisfied our needs in the\r\n matter of baking powder, custard powder, jelly crystals, and the\r\n like.\r\n\r\n There was over half a ton of fancy biscuits of excellent quality and\r\n great variety, for which we were indebted to Jacob and Company\r\n (Dublin), Arnott Brothers (Sydney), and Patria Biscuit Fabriek\r\n (Amsterdam).  \"Hardtack,\" the name by which a plain wholemeal\r\n biscuit of good quality, made by Swallow and Ariell (Melbourne) was\r\n known, constituted the greater part of the remaining two and a half\r\n tons of ordinary biscuits.  \"Hardtack\" was much appreciated as a\r\n change from the usual \"staff of life\"--soda bread.\r\n\r\n For sledging we had secured one ton of biscuits specially prepared\r\n by the Plasmon Company (London) containing 30 per cent. of plasmon.\r\n These, together with one ton of pemmican and half a ton of emergency\r\n ration prepared by the Bovril Company (London), are specially referred\r\n to in the chapter on sledging equipment.\r\n\r\n Butter was an important item; the large stock of two and a half tons\r\n coming from the Colac Dairying Company (Melbourne).  The butter was\r\n taken fresh in fifty-six lb. blocks, packed in the usual export\r\n cases.  On the 'Aurora' it was carried as deck-cargo, and at the Main\r\n Base was stacked in the open air on the southern side of the Hut.  At\r\n the end of the second year (1913) it was still quite good; a fact\r\n which speaks well for the climate as a refrigerator.  Of Australian\r\n cheese we used half a ton, and this was supplied in forty-pound\r\n blocks.\r\n\r\n The firm of Messrs. Cadbury, well known for their cocoa and eating\r\n chocolate, supplied us with these commodities, and receive our\r\n unqualified praise for the standard of the articles and the way in\r\n which they were packed.  The total consumption was one ton of cocoa\r\n and half a ton of chocolate.\r\n\r\n The three-quarters of a ton of tea was donated by \"Te Sol\"\r\n (Guernsey) and Griffiths Brothers (Melbourne).  In both cases the\r\n articles were well packed and much appreciated.  Half a ton of coffee\r\n was used, partly supplied from London and partly donated by\r\n Griffiths Brothers.\r\n\r\n Rose's (London) lime juice, as an antiscorbutic, was mainly reserved\r\n for consumption on the Ship.  This lime juice was much in favour as a\r\n beverage.\r\n\r\n Other supplies, taken in bulk, and for which we are indebted to the\r\n manufacturers, are: one ton of Cerebos Salt, half a ton of Castle\r\n salt, one ton of Sunlight Soap, our complete requirements in toilet\r\n soap from Pears, candles from Price, matches from Bryant and May\r\n including special sledging vestas, and dried milk from the Trufood\r\n Company.\r\n\r\n Sweets, which were used for dessert and on special occasions, were\r\n presented by the firms of Fuller and Batger of London, and by Farrah\r\n of Harrogate, &c.  There were also small quantities of aerated waters,\r\n ales, wines, and whisky for each Base.**  At the Main Base, at least,\r\n there was no demand for whisky until penguin omelettes became\r\n fashionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n      ** * Donated by Schweppes, Kopke, Burgoyne, and others.\r\n\r\n The smokers were well provided for by a generous donation of Capstan\r\n tobaccos, cigarettes and cigars from the British American Tobacco\r\n Company in London.  At a later date, when our Macquarie Island party\r\n was formed, the Sydney branch of the same firm met our added needs\r\n with the same generosity.\r\n\r\n There are many other items which have not yet found a place in this\r\n summary which cannot be acknowledged severally, but for which we are\r\n none the less grateful.  Mention is made of the following:  Horlick's\r\n Malted Milk, Neave's Health Diet, Brown and Polson's Cornflour,\r\n International Plasmon Company's Plasmon chocolate and Plasmon powder,\r\n Bovril and lime juice nodules manufactured by Bovril Limited,\r\n Colman's Mustard and Groats, Flemington Meat Company's desiccated\r\n soups, Seager's meats, Nestle's nut-milk chocolate, Escoffier's soups,\r\n &c.\r\n\r\n The cooking range which served us well for two years in the Hut at\r\n Adelie Land was from J. Smith and Wellstood (London); others were\r\n presented by Metters (Adelaide).\r\n\r\n The total supply of foods purchased and donated aggregated quite one\r\n hundred tons, exclusive of packing.  Much of this was assembled in\r\n London.  In Australia the Government Produce Department of Adelaide\r\n rendered valuable assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n TABLE OF FOOD-SUPPLIES FOR A TWELVE-MAN BASE\r\n\r\n The following are the food requirements for a party of twelve men\r\n wintering in the Antarctic.  It is our own store list, with slight\r\n modifications where these are found desirable.  The figures are based\r\n on the supposition that unlimited quantities of seal and penguin meat\r\n can be had on the spot, and, furthermore, are ample for a second\r\n year's requirements should the party be unavoidably detained.  The\r\n fare during the second year might be somewhat less varied, but would\r\n otherwise be sufficient.  Health was, of course, the first\r\n consideration in this selection, but economy was also studied.  The\r\n quantities are stated in pounds weight.\r\n\r\n                                                                    lbs.\r\n Meats, tinned--Corned beef, 216; roast beef, 72; roast mutton, 72;\r\n boiled mutton, 72; Irish stew, 216; assorted meats, 168, including\r\n mutton cutlets, haricot mutton, ox tail, ox tongue, sausages, and\r\n brawn; sheep's tongues, 288; special meats, 192, including rabbit,\r\n hare, duck, fowl, and turkey................... 1296\r\n\r\n Live sheep--16 sheep to be dressed south of 60 degrees S. latitude\r\n (weight not included)\r\n\r\n Suet, tinned--400......................... 400\r\n\r\n Bacon and Ham--Bacon in sides, packed in salt, 250; ham, 250...  500\r\n\r\n Fish, tinned--Salmon, 360; haddocks, 96; kippered herrings, 216;\r\n herrings in tomato sauce, 72; fresh herrings, 72; sardines, 300;\r\n cods' roe, curried prawns, &c., 72..............,   1188\r\n\r\n Soups, assorted tinned, 1152..................   1152\r\n\r\n Vegetables, fresh, in wooden cases--new potatoes, 1200; onions,\r\n 3601560\r\n             Tinned--potatoes, 864; onions, 216; peas, 450;\r\n French beans, 450; spinach, 360; cabbage, 144; beetroot, 288;\r\n carrots, 288; parsnips, 144; turnips, 108; celery, 144;\r\n leeks, 72; champignons, 144; Boston baked beans, 144;\r\n tomatoes, 288.....................    3240\r\n\r\n Cereals and Dried Vegetables, &c.--Split peas, 112; lentils, 56;\r\n marrowfat peas, 56; haricot beans, 56; barley, 72; rice, 252;\r\n tapioca, 144; semolina, 56; macaroni, 56; rolled oats, 648;\r\n cornflour, 156........................    1664\r\n\r\n Flour, including plain, wholemeal, and self-rising......    4480\r\n  Biscuits, &c.--Plasmon wholemeal, 1344; plain wholemeal, 560;\r\n assorted sweet, 560; cake tinned, 224; plum pudding, 224....   1712\r\n\r\n Fruit, tinned in syrup--peaches, 288; pears, 288; plums, 288;\r\n apricots, 288; pineapples, 288; apples, 288; gooseberries, 216;\r\n cherries, 216; mulberries, 48; strawberries, 48; red currants, 48;\r\n black currants, 48; raspberries, 48...............  2400\r\n\r\n Dried fruits--Prunes, 112; apples, 112; peaches, 56; nectarines, 56;\r\n apricots, 56; raisins seeded, 224; currants, 112; figs, 224;\r\n dates, 112; candied peel, 56..................  1120\r\n\r\n Sweets, &c.--Eating chocolate (chiefly for sledging) 504; assorted\r\n sweets, 168; crystallized fruits, 56; assorted nuts, 84.....   812\r\n\r\n Milk--as dried powder, 2400...................  2400\r\n\r\n Butter--in 56 lb. export cases, 1456..............  1456\r\n\r\n Cheese--in original blocks or tins, 240.............   240\r\n\r\n Cocoa, Tea, and Coffee--Cocoa, 576; tea, 288; coffee, 288....  1152\r\n\r\n Sugar, Jam, &c.--Sugar, 3584; jam, 1456; marmalade, 448;\r\n honey, 576; syrup, 288.....................   6352\r\n\r\n Sauces, Pickles, &c.--Tomato sauce, 180; Worcester sauce, 135;\r\n sweet pickles, 162; mango chutney, 81; assorted pickles\r\n (first quality) 216; vinegar, 210...............    984\r\n\r\n Cooking requisites--Baking powder (in addition to that in\r\n selfrising flour) 56; sodium bicarbonate, 1; ground mixed spice, 3;\r\n ground ginger, 4; whole cloves, 1; nutmegs, 2; assorted essences, 10;\r\n desiccated cocoanut, 12; mixed dried herbs, 2; dried mint, 6; dried\r\n parsley, 1; onion powder, 9; curry powder, 30; mustard, 30; black\r\n pepper, 12; white pepper, 12; table salt, 784..........   975\r\n\r\n Soap, &c.--Soap, 448; soda, 168.................   616\r\n\r\n                                      (16 tons approx.)           35,699\r\n\r\n\r\n Note.  These weights are exclusive of packing.  When high southern\r\n latitudes can be reached within three weeks, fresh eggs may be taken\r\n with advantage, preferably unfertilized, but care should be taken to\r\n freeze them as soon as possible, and not to allow them to thaw again\r\n until required for use.  It is advisable to take small quantities\r\n of whisky, ale, wines and lime juice.  Matches, candles, soap, and\r\n other toilet requirements, kerosene and fuel are not reckoned with\r\n here, appearing in a more general stores' list.  Certain medical\r\n comforts, such as malted milk and plasmon, may also be included.\r\n\r\n Medical Equipment\r\n\r\n The medical equipment consisted of a complete outfit of Burroughs\r\n and Wellcome's drug's, dressings, &c., and Allen and Hanbury's\r\n surgical instruments.  Sets, varying in character with particular\r\n requirements, were made up for the Ship and for each of the land\r\n parties.  Contained within the fifty-five boxes was a wonderful\r\n assortment of everything which could possibly have been required\r\n on a polar expedition.  There was in addition a set of Burroughs\r\n and Wellcome's medicines for the treatment of dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n Scientific Equipment\r\n\r\n The scope of our projected scientific work necessitated extensive\r\n purchases, and these were amplified by loans from many scientific\r\n bodies and individuals.\r\n\r\n Instruments for surveying and navigation were loaned by the Royal\r\n Geographical Society and by the Admiralty, while many theodolites,\r\n chronometers, and half-chronometer watches were manufactured to order.\r\n\r\n An assortment of oceanographical gear was generously supplied through\r\n H. S. H. The Prince of Monaco, from the Institut Oceanographique\r\n of Monaco.  Dr. W. S. Bruce made similar donations and supervised the\r\n construction of our largest deep-sea dredge.  The three-thousand\r\n fathom tapered steel cables and mountings, designed to work the\r\n deep-water dredges, were supplied by Messrs. Bullivant.  Appliances\r\n were also loaned by Mr. J. T. Buchanan of the 'Challenger' Expedition\r\n and by the Commonwealth Fisheries Department.  The self-recording\r\n tide-gauges we employed were the property of the New South Wales\r\n Government, obtained through Mr. G. Halligan.\r\n\r\n The taxidermists' requirements, and other necessaries for the\r\n preservation of zoological specimens, were for the most part purchased,\r\n but great assistance was rendered through Professor Baldwin-Spencer\r\n by the National Museum of Melbourne and by the South Australian Museum,\r\n through the offices of Professor Stirling.  Articles of equipment for\r\n botanical work were loaned by Mr. J. H. Maiden, Director of the\r\n Botanical Gardens, Sydney.\r\n\r\n A supply of heavy cameras for base-station work and light cameras for\r\n sledging was purchased; our stock being amplified by many private\r\n cameras, especially those belonging to F. H. Hurley, photographer of\r\n the Expedition.  Special Lumiere plates and material for colour\r\n photography were not omitted, and, during the final cruise of the\r\n 'Aurora', P. E. Correll employed the more recent Paget process for\r\n colour photography with good results.\r\n\r\n The programme of magnetic work was intended to be as extensive as\r\n possible.  In the matter of equipment we were very materially assisted\r\n by the Carnegie Institute through Dr. L. A. Bauer.  An instrument\r\n was also loaned through Mr. H. F. Skey of the Christchurch Magnetic\r\n Observatory.  A full set of Eschenhagen self-recording instruments\r\n was purchased, and in this and in other dispositions for the magnetic\r\n work we have to thank Dr. C. Chree, Director of the National Physical\r\n Laboratory, and Dr. C. C. Farr of University College, Christchurch.\r\n Captain Chetwynd kindly assisted in arrangements for the Ship's\r\n compasses.\r\n\r\n Two complete sets of Telefunken wireless apparatus were purchased from\r\n the Australasian Wireless Company.  The motors and dynamos were got\r\n from Buzzacott, Sydney, and the masts were built by Saxton and Binns,\r\n Sydney.  Manilla and tarred-hemp ropes were supplied on generous terms\r\n by Melbourne firms (chiefly Kinnear).\r\n\r\n The meteorological instruments were largely purchased from Negretti\r\n and Zambra, but a great number were loaned by the Commonwealth\r\n Meteorological Department (Director, Mr. H. A. Hunt) and by the\r\n British Meteorological Office (Director, Dr. W. N. Shaw).\r\n\r\n For astronomical work the following instruments were loaned, besides\r\n transit-theodolites and sextants:  a four-inch telescope by the\r\n Greenwich Observatory through the Astronomer Royal: a portable\r\n transit-theodolite by the Melbourne Observatory through the\r\n Director, Mr. P. Baracchi; two stellar sidereal chronometers by\r\n the Adelaide Observatory through the Astronomer, Mr. P. Dodwell.\r\n\r\n The apparatus for bacteriological and physiological work were got in\r\n Sydney, in arrangements and suggestions for which our thanks are due\r\n to Dr. Tidswell (Microbiological Laboratory) and Professor Welsh, of\r\n Sydney University.\r\n\r\n Artists' materials were supplied by Winsor and Newton, London, while\r\n the stationery was partly donated by John Sands, Limited, Sydney\r\n\r\n Geological, chemical, and physical apparatus were all acquired at the\r\n instance of the several workers.\r\n\r\n Adjuncts, such as a calculating machine, a typewriter, and duplicator\r\n were not forgotten.**\r\n\r\n\r\n      ** Acceptable donations of various articles were made by the firms of\r\n Ludowici, Sydney; Allen Taylor, Sydney; Sames and Company, Birmingham;\r\n Gamage, London; Gramophone Company, London; the Acetylene Corporation,\r\n London; Steel Trucks Ltd., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n      **Through the offices of Mr. C. A. Bang we are indebted to \"De\r\n Forenede Dampskibsselskab,\" of Copenhagen, for the transport of the\r\n dogs from Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\n Apart from the acquisition of the instruments, there were long\r\n preparations to be made in the arrangement of the scientific programme\r\n and in the training of the observers.  In this department the\r\n Expedition was assisted by many friends.\r\n\r\n Thus Professor W. A. Haswell (Biology), Professor T. W. Edgeworth\r\n David (Geology), and Mr. H. A. Hunt (Meteorology), each drew up\r\n instructions relating to his respective sphere.  Training in\r\n astronomical work at the Melbourne Observatory was supervised by\r\n Mr. P. Baracchi, Director, and in magnetic work by the Department\r\n of Terrestrial Magnetism, Carnegie Institute (Director, Dr. L. A.\r\n Bauer).  Further, in the subject of magnetics, we have to thank\r\n especially Mr. E. Kidston of the Carnegie Institute for field\r\n tuition, and Mr. Baldwin of the Melbourne Observatory for\r\n demonstrations in the working of the Eschenhagen magnetographs.\r\n Professor J. A. Pollock gave us valuable advice on wireless and\r\n other physical subjects.  At the Australian Museum, Sydney, Mr.\r\n Hedley rendered assistance in the zoological preparations.  In the\r\n conduct of affairs we were assisted on many occasions by Messrs. W.\r\n S. Dun (Sydney), J. H. Maiden (Sydney), Robert Hall (Hobart), G.\r\n H. Knibbs (Melbourne),and to the presidents and members of the\r\n councils of the several Geographical Societies in Australia--as well,\r\n of course, as to those of the Royal Geographical Society, London.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, the proffered, disinterested help, of all the above\r\n and many other friends contrived to make our scientific equipment\r\n well-nigh complete and eminently up-to-date.\r\n INDEX\r\n\r\n Abrasion effects of drift snow,\r\n Abruzzi expedition 1900, rations\r\n Absolute Hut, the\r\n Acetylene Corporation, London, (note)\r\n Adare, Cape\r\n Adelaide Island\r\n.........University\r\n 'Adelie Blizzard'\r\n........Land;\r\n            the main base at; glaciation of; hurricanes of; Wilkes'\r\n            account of; the Hut; drifts; wireless installation at;\r\n            clothing for; Empire Day in; temperatures\r\n Admiralty Range\r\n Aerial Cove, depot\r\n Aeroplane sledge.
